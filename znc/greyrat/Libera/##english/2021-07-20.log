[06:12:07] <paulo_> if you're open to discussing it, why did you get banned in ##programming ?
[06:12:16] <rindolf> paulo_: hi

[06:17:56] <rindolf> paulo_: story of my life. I think I've been jinxed, but arguably it was due to conscious choices - "free will"/etc.

[06:33:00] <rindolf> twb: i meant "two"
[06:33:52] <rindolf> = you and tinw
[06:34:30] <tinwhiskers> this story plays out with you in just about every channel though rindolf so don't seem too shocked.

[06:36:35] <tinwhiskers> case in point
[06:37:38] <tinwhiskers> I think it's great that you've reduced the amount of spam to your website though, so thanks for that.
[06:38:14] <rindolf> tinwhiskers: no worries: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbY_aP-alkw

[06:39:13] <tinwhiskers> yeah... heh

[06:43:12] <rindolf> and the bible had links too. some of them are broken now too: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-canonical_books_referenced_in_the_Bible . ppl here keep trying to limit what i can say based on groundless whims
[06:43:58] <tinwhiskers> yes, the constant religious links are a bit annoying along with the hollywood obsession links

[18:43:13] <bin> i thought it was "suck my dick"
[18:43:39] <blkshp> 0.0
[18:43:40] <bin> I also always read TPM as Tire Pressure Monitor
[18:44:01] <blkshp> Trusted Platform Module
[18:44:16] <bin> nah it was Tire Pressure Monitor for decades before
[18:44:21] <bin> they really could've come up with a better name
[18:44:30] <bin> rather than appropriating an exciting initialism
[18:45:02] <blkshp> Referring to a Tyre pressure monitor as a TPM must be an Americanism
[18:45:49] <pussipupu> Who is the platform module trusted by?
[18:46:11] <blkshp> The machine in which it's installed.
[18:46:19] *** Quits: fweht (uid404746@id-404746.tooting.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[18:47:33] <bin> maybe, it's in every single car
[18:47:55] <blkshp> We call it a Tyre pressure guage anyway.
[18:48:02] <bin> TPMS = Tire Pressure Monitoring System
[18:48:09] <bin> has been in every new car since like 2007
[18:48:24] <blkshp> Well that's not TPM then is it :P lol
[18:48:27] <bin> and the button will often just say "TPM"
[18:48:34] <blkshp> What button?
[18:48:50] <bin> ?? the button to check the tire pressure
[18:48:59] <blkshp> MY 2011 has no such button
[18:49:11] <bin> o.o
[18:49:19] <huf> cant you just look?
[18:49:22] <TimMc> Each sequence of letters shall correspond to one and only one meaning.
[18:49:23] <blkshp> It will tell me when the pressure is down but not what the pressure is.
[18:49:41] <bin> not what the pressure is exactly (although some cars do have that) but to check that the pressure is good or whatever
[18:49:42] <huf> TimMc: eleven ember comb
[18:49:50] <huf> I agree with you!
[18:50:04] <blkshp> I have only had one car that actually told me the pressure of the tyres and when it broke i had loopbacks put in and that systm was no more :D
[18:50:31] <TimMc> huf: That's an extremely deep insight, but kind of a ride phrasing tbh.
[18:50:34] <TimMc> *rude
[18:50:35] <blkshp> bin: it just tells me when it's low with a little yellow tyre icon
[18:50:47] <CuriosTiger> Hi.
[18:50:59] <bin> blkshp: same but isn't there a "TPM" button to reset it?
[18:51:04] <blkshp> Nope
[18:51:14] <bin> interesting
[18:51:27] <CuriosTiger> blkshp: Hrm, where did you obtain said loopbacks.
[18:51:30] <huf> TimMc: they're three sequences of letters that only mean one thing
[18:51:33] <huf> AND NOT TWO
[18:51:33] <bin> in my current car it's part of the infotainment system so there's no standalone button but prior to that it was just a button
[18:51:35] <huf> definitely not.
[18:51:40] <pussipupu> My car doesn't monitor tyre pressure but also it's made largely of rust
[18:51:42] <blkshp> We do have different dash configs
[18:51:54] <blkshp> and we're not allowed beeping central locking
[18:52:04] <CuriosTiger> blkshp: My 2011 BMW has wheels off a 2014 BMW. I have my original wheels, but transferring the sensors requires removing the tires.
[18:52:07] <huf> blkshp: huh?
[18:52:17] <bin> <blkshp> and we're not allowed beeping central locking   
[18:52:19] <blkshp> no bweep bweep when you lock cars in the UK.
[18:52:19] <bin> like... at all?
[18:52:27] <huf> blkshp: what does it say then? just nothing?
[18:52:30] <huf> _why_?
[18:52:32] <blkshp> None, it's illegal to sound your horn unless in an emergency after 11pm
[18:52:33] <bin> how do you know when it's locked?
[18:52:33] <TimMc> Thanks god.
[18:52:34] <CuriosTiger> and of course the 2014 sensors don't work with the 2011 ECM. Because, why would they?
[18:52:37] <TimMc> *Thank
[18:52:38] <TimMc> lol
[18:52:39] <blkshp> the lights flash
[18:52:41] <bin> wow that's insane
[18:52:41] <huf> wait what?
[18:52:43] <huf> it's not that loud
[18:52:44] <blkshp> and you hear a clunk
[18:52:52] <blkshp> no loud unnecessary noises
[18:52:54] <TimMc> I really hate beeping cat locks.
[18:52:56] <bin> Let me tell you, if the light turns green and you do not go, I will consider that an emergency
[18:53:00] <TimMc> jesus christ my typing today
[18:53:10] <pussipupu> don't lock cats, that's mean
[18:53:30] <CuriosTiger> The BMW doesn't beep.
[18:53:37] <blkshp> That's illegal too bin
[18:53:46] <CuriosTiger> The Lincoln doesn't beep the first time, but beeps if you hit lock a second time.
[18:53:53] <TimMc> Are you supposed to nudge 'em with the bumper?
[18:53:55] <blkshp> intimidation
[18:53:59] <blkshp> No you wait.
[18:54:08] <blkshp> everyone does beep but that's not the point.
[18:54:11] <TimMc> heh
[18:54:21] <bin> Welp, I guess I won't go to the UK unless I'm in the back of a limo and can't see the lights.
[18:54:24] <CuriosTiger> Norway has a similar law. "No unnecessary noise or smoke".
[18:54:38] <CuriosTiger> that second one has been reinterpreted to become an idling ban.
[18:54:45] <bin> I can't imagine WAITING for someone at a green light. The absolute audacity
[18:54:45] * pussipupu turns off the disco and puts out the blunt
[18:55:14] <bin> but then again, I'm a NYer and a NY minute is defined as the amount of time between when the light turns green and the guy behind you honks his horn
[18:55:17] <bin> about .3 seconds :)
[18:56:02] <TimMc> blkshp: The degree to which I think that's a reasonable law is strongly connected to the degree to which people obey laws about not browsing funny image sites while at stoplights.
[18:56:20] <blkshp> Also illegal.
[18:56:32] <blkshp> It is illegal to touch your phone whilst the engine is on.
[18:56:33] <TimMc> bin: Pretty sure it's about -0.01 seconds
[18:56:47] <bin> lolol
[18:56:53] <blkshp> Any yeah, i have done a lot of london driving, i guess it's about the same as NYC
[18:56:54] <bin> nahhh we don't usually go back in time 
[18:57:20] <TimMc> That would be a kind of fun but mostly horrible software project.
[18:57:22] <bin> It's illegal to touch your phone while the engine is on??? What an absurd law. This is why people don't follow laws tbh
[18:57:27] <bin> TimMc: agreed hahaha
[18:57:30] <TimMc> Set up your horn to beep *just* before the light goes green.
[18:57:44] <blkshp> For what purpose would you need to touch your phone while the engine is on?
[18:57:44] <bin> somehow tie into the traffic light system
[18:57:55] <blkshp> Not saying i don't ignore it most of the time but still!
[18:57:56] <TimMc> You could just record the timings at a few lights.
[18:58:05] <TimMc> blkshp: Day-trading.
[18:58:06] <bin> blkshp: adjusting the GPS route due to traffic or something similar
[18:58:24] <blkshp> They'd suggest you park somewhere first.
[18:58:29] <bin> or if you're a delivery driver, letting the customer know you're late while sitting at the restaurant with your engine idling
[18:58:37] <TimMc> Don't idle. -.-
[18:58:41] <bin> It's absurd to be expected to fully turn the engine off
[18:58:46] <blkshp> Turn the engine off. You shouldn't be idling anyway.
[18:58:48] <blkshp> Why?
[18:58:57] <bin> Because it's uncomfortable to be sitting in a hot car?
[18:58:59] <blkshp> And no it does not take more fuel to start a car.
[18:59:01] <bin> and it's a waste of gas
[18:59:16] <blkshp> The waste of gas is sitting there idling
[18:59:18] <bin> also there are plenty of situations where you can't turn the engine off, like if you're charging the battery
[18:59:50] <TimMc> If you can't run A/C for a few minutes, get a new battery.
[18:59:51] <blkshp> Why would you be charging the battery?! usually if it needs to be charged by leaving the engine on it's failed the MOT ans is not on the road xD
[19:00:03] <blkshp> TimMc: AC wont run with the engine of.
[19:00:06] <blkshp> off*
[19:00:20] <TimMc> Oh really? Weird. Something about needing to dump heat?
[19:00:22] <bin> You've never had your car battery die?
[19:00:35] <bin> TimMc: the compressor doesn't run when the engine is off.
[19:00:36] <blkshp> Once, i had it immediately replaced by the AA
[19:00:46] <blkshp> Twice, i had both of them replaced by the AA!
[19:00:51] <blkshp> different cars
[19:00:56] <bin> blkshp: well my car battery dies if I leave it for too long because the computer is always on
[19:00:58] <TimMc> Anyway, you can deal with a few minutes of slightly less than optimal temperature.
[19:01:43] <bin> and when that happens, then you have to drive for a while and leave the engine idling to recharge the battery.
[19:02:00] <blkshp> But that's not exactly a common occurence
[19:02:00] <bin> TimMc: maybe you can, but I certainly won't
[19:02:02] <TimMc> Back when I used to drive, I basically never used the AC.
[19:02:05] <bin> blkshp: yes it is
[19:02:17] <blkshp> No, it isn't
[19:02:17] <bin> I guess you guys also don't have drive-in movie theaters. 
[19:02:23] <blkshp> Anyway im not arguing about it
[19:02:26] <bin> blkshp: maybe for you it isn't, but for me it is.
[19:02:27] <blkshp> No, we dont
[19:02:44] <TimMc> bin: Where do you live that still has drive-in movie theaters?!
[19:02:48] <blkshp> Well we were talking about the lawsd here :D
[19:02:55] <bin> TimMc: the US
[19:03:02] <TimMc> Not 'round these parts.
[19:03:08] <TimMc> and this century
[19:03:10] <bin> blkshp: if there are Mazda 3s on the road in the UK then it's a much more common occurrence then you realise
[19:03:19] <bin> TimMc: sure there are, you probably just haven't looked.
[19:03:26] <bin> s/then/than/
[19:03:26] <tinsoldier> b​in meant: blkshp: if there are Mazda 3s on the road in the UK than it's a much more common occurrence then you realise
[19:03:31] <bin> ugh
[19:03:43] <bin> s/then you/than you/
[19:03:44] <tinsoldier> b​in meant: blkshp: if there are Mazda 3s on the road in the UK then it's a much more common occurrence than you realise
[19:04:05] <bin> If there are cars with remote start on the road too.
[19:04:18] <LuisP18> don't see beeping car alarms quite often
[19:04:20] <bin> Any car that has an always-on computer ill have to be driven every few days or at least once a week
[19:04:24] <bin> will*
[19:04:32] <blkshp> less than 1000
[19:04:56] <LuisP18> except when accidentally triggering the alarm
[19:05:09] <bin> According to Mazda my car should be driven 15 miles every 72 hours, which I find to be kind of absurd. 
[19:05:49] <bin> But like that's their battery guarantee lol if you don't drive every 72 hours then don't be surprised when the battery dies
[19:05:50] <LuisP18> every 6 days?
[19:06:05] <bin> 72 hoursis 3 days
[19:06:31] * LuisP18 errmath'd
[19:12:04] <TimMc> bin: Ah, apparently there are 5 in my state.
[19:12:35] <TimMc> They're kind of the epitome of car-centric culture.
[19:14:01] <bin> they're the safest way to show movies during Covid
[19:14:05] <bin> and they're tons of fun
[19:14:24] <bin> I finally have a perfect drive-in car now too.

[20:11:02] <bin> there used to be only 1 or 2 within 50 miles and now there are several
[20:11:13] <huf> they seem very cheap to build
[20:11:30] <huf> a bit of flat ground, a screen, a booth with the projector, a fence, a ticket booth
[20:11:34] <bin> depends on if you can get the land cheaply and what kind of system you implement
[20:11:36] <huf> oh and a popcorn stand
[20:11:41] <bin> plus you have to have multiple screens
[20:11:47] <huf> well that makes it trickier

[20:12:13] <huf> I was imagining something more redneck than you :D
[20:12:17] <bin> The one I go to used to have the speaker boxes, but I guess maintaining them was too expensive so now they have only radio broadcast
[20:12:44] <huf> hmm, come to think of it, I've never been in a drive in theater
[20:12:44] <bin> huf: true, you could definitely do a pop-up type one with an HD projector and a white billboard
[20:12:51] <huf> just a normal walk-in sit-down but open-air theater
[20:13:07] <bin> but you would have to either have speaker boxes or a strong enough radio transmitter
[20:13:25] <bin> still though, fairly inexpensive
[20:13:30] <huf> anyway, it's still a lot cheaper than building a huge building
[20:13:33] <bin> and if you did old movies then the licensing cost goes way down too
[20:13:36] <huf> and putting all this inside it anyway :)
[20:13:37] <bin> oh agreed 100% on that
[20:13:57] <bin> the biggest downside though is that you can't really enjoy the drive-in when it's raining
[20:14:44] <huf> hmm
[20:14:51] <bin> One thing that I found SLIGHTLY annoying but also I was glad about it was when I went to the drive-in two weeks ago it seems that State Farm is sponsoring drive-ins because there were a bunch of State Farm commercials
[20:14:53] <huf> you could hand out small hd screens to each car
[20:14:55] <huf> :D
[20:14:59] <huf> when it's raining
[20:15:20] <bin> and honestly I think that's fantastic. They make $0 on ticket sales and with Covid they had to close down refreshments entirely for a while and now are only doing limited refreshments
[20:15:27] <bin> and single-features instead of double
[20:15:37] <bin> which means fewer snack sales
[20:15:38] *** Quits: powermail (uid385576@id-385576.highgate.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[20:15:57] <CuriosTiger> the main trouble with driveins here is that you really do need AC
[20:15:58] <bin> so I'm thrilled that they have a sponsor to help them stay open even though after the 12th commercial I was kind of tired of them
[20:16:06] <bin> CuriosTiger: yeah 
[20:16:10] <CuriosTiger> so people idle
[20:16:35] <huf> ow
[20:17:57] <bin> We couldn't really take my car because the radio doesn't run long enough off the battery. Too many computers
[20:18:24] <CuriosTiger> That's probably another reason people idle.
[20:18:31] <bin> yeah
[20:18:42] <CuriosTiger> Most car batteries aren't going to survive several hours with the ignition in "accessory" mode.
[20:18:47] <bin> yep
[20:18:49] <CuriosTiger> even with the headlights off
[20:19:14] <bin> the good thing is though that a lot of people will sit outside of their cars or in the pickup bed with radios so not everyone is idling
[20:19:43] <CuriosTiger> Yep. Unfortunately, they don't usually separate the two groups, so those guys are treated to a few hours of exhaust
[20:20:06] <CuriosTiger> But with modern cars it's probably not too much of an issue. I can only imagine what that was like in the 1960s.
[20:20:12] <bin> yeah same
[20:20:21] <huf> I think I know
[20:20:26] <huf> it was like budapest in the 90s :D
[20:20:32] <bin> fortunately in my experience *knock on wood* the diesel trucks are always off
[20:20:45] <bin> diesel makes me sick
[20:20:59] <huf> mixed oil and gasoline has the best smell
[20:21:03] <CuriosTiger> Modern diesels are pretty darn clean. But "modern" means 2007 and up.
[20:21:09] <huf> for stupid-lubing 2-stroke engines
[20:21:27] <CuriosTiger> also, diesel pickups are generally loud enough to be a noise disturbance
[20:21:45] <CuriosTiger> I would consider it rude to take my Dodge Ram to a drive-in unless I turn it off and sit on the tailgate.
[20:21:51] <CuriosTiger> and in Florida, that'll get muggy in a hurry
[20:22:19] <huf> maybe cars should come with a plug for wall electricity
[20:22:26] <huf> and drive in theaters could give you a hose
[20:22:32] <huf> like a marina does for boats
[20:22:35] <CuriosTiger> that would be a cord, not a hose.
[20:22:40] <huf> eh
[20:22:54] <huf> yeah but I like mixing up various long thin thing words
[20:23:00] <huf> calling wires strings, that sort of thing
[20:23:25] <pussipupu> It's all string, that's just electric string as opposed to mooring string
[20:23:26] <CuriosTiger> well, sure, then you could plug your string into your car's cavity.
[20:23:42] <huf> well it'd solve this problem
[20:23:50] <pussipupu> Turns out when you use the electric string as a mooring warp the pontoon looses power
[20:23:55] <CuriosTiger> The infrastructure for that would probably be cost-prohibitive for most driveins though
[20:23:57] <pussipupu> And the boat floats off
[20:24:00] <CuriosTiger> but the idea isn't ad.
[20:24:01] <huf> electric cars come with the solution already built-in
[20:24:15] <huf> CuriosTiger: maybe the cost will come down somewhat
[20:24:23] <huf> as they start building charging stations _everywhere_
[20:24:35] <CuriosTiger> Back when I was driving 18-wheelers, they tried to do that with this central air system that fit into your passenger window
[20:24:39] <CuriosTiger> so you wouldn't have to idle at truck stops
[20:24:56] <CuriosTiger> The problem with that idea is that you were treated to whatever odors were in the cab of the previous truck, usually cig smoke
[20:25:04] <CuriosTiger> which is worse
[20:25:08] <huf> ugh yeah
[20:25:13] <pussipupu> There's moves here to retrofit the engine block heater power stanchions for charging engine batteries, but I don't know that they're any significant way along
[20:25:16] <pussipupu> Good idea though in principle
[20:25:36] <CuriosTiger> huf: The problem is that to have a number of charging stations, you'll need more than the 200 amps a typical electric hookup supplies
[20:25:40] <huf> CuriosTiger: dont those beasts have a generator so they can charge batteries without running the main engine?
[20:25:48] <CuriosTiger> huf: It wouldn't be a problem to put in one or two, but you couldn't put in dozens.
[20:26:04] <CuriosTiger> huf: Nowadays they increasingly do. That started with idling bans in the mid-2000s
[20:26:16] <huf> aye, I have vague memories of reading about this
[20:26:29] <CuriosTiger> huf: Even that isn't uncontroversial, however, as those generators still pollute. To use a generator in California, for example, you have to have a model that is certified by CARB.
[20:26:50] <CuriosTiger> Some people who had spent $10K on a generator were not amused when California said they weren't allowed to use them.
[20:27:03] <huf> :D
[20:27:12] <CuriosTiger> There was a loophole back in the day where you could run your generator -- or even idle the truck -- if you had a pet in the cab with you.
[20:27:19] <CuriosTiger> Pet lives matter. Driver lives don't.
[20:27:30] <CuriosTiger> I'm guessing that loophole is closed by now.
[20:28:41] <CuriosTiger> huf: I think some of the rules are pretty unreasonable.
[20:29:15] <CuriosTiger> huf: In general, I find that legislation that prohibits something people rely on without first providing a workable alternative is a bad idea.
[20:29:20] <bin> CuriosTiger: for me it's about the smell. The smell of diesel is a massive migraine trigger for me
[20:29:43] <CuriosTiger> huf: When it comes to trucks, I think the right approach would've been to mandate CARB-compliant generators only on trucks built AFTER the law took effect, and grandfather existing trucks.
[20:29:48] <CuriosTiger> That would still get pollution down over time.
[20:30:07] <huf> or at least give them some time so the regulations and service industry has time to settle
[20:30:10] <CuriosTiger> and with far less expense and inconviennce -- or worse -- for people driving their existing truck
[20:30:29] <CuriosTiger> bin: That's understandable, most people find the smell objectionable.
[20:31:01] <CuriosTiger> bin: Ironically, while the main truck engine now has particulate filters and urea exhaust aftertreatment that completely eliminates the smell, the generators don't.
[20:31:13] <bin> CuriosTiger: that's interesting, I didn't know that
[20:31:19] <CuriosTiger> bin: So now idling the truck causes less odor than running the genrator.
[20:31:38] <bin> Do you have to deal with "rolling coal" assholes down there
[20:31:42] <CuriosTiger> bin: The exhaust aftertreatment systems are bulky and require a certain operating temperature. They are not practical on very small engines such as those used in generators.
[20:31:55] <CuriosTiger> bin: You do. They're especially fun on a motorcycle.
[20:32:16] <CuriosTiger> I mean, I kind of get why rolling coal is "fun"
[20:32:22] <CuriosTiger> but it belongs on a track, not in traffic
[20:32:39] <CuriosTiger> if you do it on a closed course at a tractor pull or something like that, I have no problem with it.
[20:32:55] <CuriosTiger> if you do it in traffic, you're a dipshit.
[20:33:25] <bin> yes agreed
[20:33:46] <bin> I don't have an issue with it just on principle, there are plenty of fun use-cases.
[20:33:51] <bin> But in traffic... eff you LOL
[20:34:15] <huf> they could just buy a trabant
[20:34:21] <huf> that's got rolling coal built right in
[20:34:27] <huf> and 30 feels like 90 in it :D
[20:34:28] <CuriosTiger> I don't mind the smell of diesel -- to me, it's a strangely nostalgic reminder of when I drove trucks
[20:34:37] <CuriosTiger> but I have other smells I mind, so I can certainly sympathize.
[20:34:57] <CuriosTiger> huf: The Trabant rolls blue smoke, not coal. Two-stroke engine.
[20:35:02] <huf> I'm still amazed that unaltered trabants are road-legal in at least some US states
[20:35:09] <CuriosTiger> huf: I got plenty of that in Key West this weekend, since they have a million little scooters
[20:35:10] <huf> CuriosTiger: yeah but it's still pretty bad :D
[20:35:22] <CuriosTiger> huf: They are legal many places in Europe too
[20:35:34] <huf> that's madness too
[20:35:35] <CuriosTiger> huf: The general principle is that they have to comply with the emissions rules in place at the time they were built.
[20:35:53] <CuriosTiger> huf: There aren't enough of them for that to really be a problem.
[20:35:53] <huf> at least there arent enough of them about anymore to matter
[20:35:55] <huf> yeah
[20:36:06] <CuriosTiger> huf: I just bought a 1977 BMW.
[20:36:16] <CuriosTiger> It has "antique" auto tags on it.
[20:36:29] <huf> so you're going to be fixing it all the time then?
[20:36:32] <CuriosTiger> But it complies with the emissions rules that applied in 1977
[20:36:43] <CuriosTiger> huf: It's not a daily driver.
[20:36:51] <CuriosTiger> I'll be taking it to auto shows and perhaps for a ride or two just for fun.
[20:37:18] <CuriosTiger> but it wouldn't be reasonable for me to have to spend more than the car is worth to try to clean up the emissions
[20:37:23] <bin> the way the exhaust rules are done in some states is really dumb. "Cars older than 25 years exempt from exhaust" which means that in 2021 a '96 Camry is exempt, and in 2050 a 2015 Mazda is exempt
[20:37:25] <bin> so dumb
[20:37:34] <bin> it should be instead "Cars prior to 1975" or something
[20:37:49] <CuriosTiger> bin: The Camry is a bad example, because they last forever. But generally speaking, most cars are no longer on the road after 25 years.
[20:38:05] <bin> no it's a perfect example because they're on the road for so long
[20:38:08] <CuriosTiger> bin: The problem with "Cars prior to 1975" is that many collectible cars were built after 1975.
[20:38:18] <bin> then they don't get to be exempt
[20:38:24] <CuriosTiger> It would be silly, for example, to require annual smog checks on a 1980 Morris Mini
[20:38:34] <bin> I just made up the 1975 date tbh
[20:38:39] <bin> Idk what the best date would be
[20:38:43] <bin> maybe it would be 1990 idk
[20:38:45] <CuriosTiger> Right, but any cutoff like that is by necessity arbitrary
[20:38:54] <bin> It's less arbitrary than 25 years
[20:39:14] <bin> there's no reason why a 1996 camry should be exempt from exhaust and co2 inspections
[20:39:21] <CuriosTiger> By 2040, a car like my BMW 335is convertible -- which hasn't been made since 2013 and which was only built in limited numbers -- will be genuinely collectible
[20:39:26] <CuriosTiger> so I think a rolling window makes sense.
[20:39:55] <bin> but there's no reason why it shouldn't pass all exhaust inspections
[20:40:02] <CuriosTiger> Sure.
[20:40:09] <bin> so it shouldn't be exempt from them
[20:40:12] <CuriosTiger> and a 1996 Camry probably will. Toyota builds a solid product.
[20:40:18] <bin> yeah it definitely would
[20:40:20] <huf> I think it's totally fine to inconvenience collectors
[20:40:24] <CuriosTiger> There's a different problem though
[20:40:33] <huf> the rules should be crafted mainly so poor people can still drive their busted up old cars
[20:40:37] <CuriosTiger> The rules change every single year
[20:40:45] <bin> if the car was manufactured with a catalytic converter it shouldn't be exempt from that
[20:40:46] <CuriosTiger> so you need to make it practical for testing stations
[20:40:52] <huf> cos people with a bit more money will likely change their cars fast enough so it's fine
[20:40:55] <bin> idk what year cat converters became standard
[20:40:56] <CuriosTiger> the US introduced OBDII for that reason -- incidentally, in 1996.
[20:41:13] <CuriosTiger> instead of having to have an expensive machine analyze what comes out the tailpipe, they plug in a computer that relies on the car's own sensors
[20:41:23] <bin> But my issue is with old-ass Toyotas and Hondas on the road spewing black shit and exempt from exhaust inspection 
[20:41:26] <CuriosTiger> bin: Catalytic converters became required in the United States in 1974.
[20:41:33] <bin> because they're older than 25 years old so they're exempt now
[20:41:43] <bin> CuriosTiger: okay then 1975 seems like a good year tbh. 
[20:41:48] <CuriosTiger> the old-ass Toyotas and Hondas have mostly had their cats removed by 19-year-olds
[20:41:48] <huf> bin: that's easy, have a govt buy-back program
[20:41:59] <bin> huf: no those just create insane amounts of waste
[20:42:00] <CuriosTiger> along with the fart pipe installation, the ludicrous body kit and the far too big spoiler.
[20:42:01] <huf> trade in your shit cheap old car for a shit cheap *new* car
[20:42:15] <CuriosTiger> huf: Gov't buy-back programs waste resources and taxpayer money.
[20:42:20] <bin> and we currently have a supply chain shortage so it would be disasterous to do that right now
[20:42:25] <huf> well yeah
[20:42:32] <CuriosTiger> bin: A supply chain shortage exacerbated by cash for clunkers btw
[20:42:35] <bin> yeah my mom took advantage of cash for clunkers and I was not happy
[20:42:38] <huf> but it'd be a quick way to get rid of a lot of ancient smokey cars
[20:42:40] <bin> back in 2003
[20:42:44] <bin> CuriosTiger: yep
[20:42:46] <CuriosTiger> I have never forgiven Obama for Cash for Clunkers
[20:42:57] <CuriosTiger> huf: Most of them break down or fail
[20:42:58] <bin> I liked my old beat up volvo!!!
[20:43:02] <CuriosTiger> huf: Florida has no inspection requirement at all
[20:43:11] <CuriosTiger> sure, you see the occasional smokey wreck on the road
[20:43:13] <CuriosTiger> but it's not common
[20:43:20] <bin> yeah
[20:43:27] <huf> oh well then
[20:43:35] <CuriosTiger> it seems like a bit of a solution in search of a problem.
[20:43:40] <bin> TX has the 25 year rule and I think NC does too
[20:43:42] <huf> way bin was going on about it, I thought it was an actual problem
[20:43:48] <CuriosTiger> and building and recycling a car also wastes resources
[20:43:49] <bin> it is a problem where I live
[20:44:03] <bin> There should be 0 smokey messes on the road lol
[20:44:06] <CuriosTiger> bin: Where do you live?
[20:44:24] <CuriosTiger> zero smokey messes would also mean zero classic cars
[20:44:31] <bin> I go between NY and TX currently
[20:44:35] <CuriosTiger> because if you get behind that 1977 BMW I purchased, you will smell it
[20:44:39] <bin> I'm okay with 0 classic cars if they're spewing black junk
[20:44:44] <CuriosTiger> I'm not.
[20:44:53] <CuriosTiger> Collectible cars matter to me.
[20:44:58] <CuriosTiger> I like car shows
[20:45:05] <CuriosTiger> I like the variation you had back then which you don't have now
[20:45:12] <CuriosTiger> I like the 1950s Cadillacs with the ridiculous tail fins
[20:45:33] <CuriosTiger> Most states have a simple solution
[20:45:40] <CuriosTiger> antique tags that limit how much you can drive the car
[20:45:54] <bin> Yes but antique is not 25 years
[20:45:56] <CuriosTiger> I'm sure you can live with passing a 1965 Jaguar once in a blue moon.
[20:46:04] <bin> Most people aren't commuting in antique cars
[20:46:19] <bin> but they are commuting in mid-90s hondas and toyotas without proper exhaust setups
[20:46:26] <CuriosTiger> bin: Which is why a special restricted-use plate is a better way to do a cutoff than age
[20:46:42] <CuriosTiger> bin: If you have a regular plate on your Honda, you have to meet smog check requirements
[20:46:53] <bin> agreed
[20:46:57] *** Joins: powermail (uid385576@id-385576.highgate.irccloud.com)
[20:46:59] <bin> I agree with that aspect
[20:46:59] <CuriosTiger> if you have an antique plate on your Honda, you can't use it to commute. And since the plate is there for all to see, that is enforcable.
[20:47:03] <CuriosTiger> Not every state does this
[20:47:04] <CuriosTiger> but many do.
[20:47:12] <bin> That should absolutely be how it's done
[20:47:17] <bin> and I /think/ that's how it's done in NY
[20:47:23] <bin> we had a family friend that had an old Model T
[20:47:27] <bin> and it had special antique plates
[20:47:31] <CuriosTiger> However, in Texas, it's not about the 1996 Honda
[20:47:37] <CuriosTiger> it's about the 1996 Ford F-350
[20:47:40] <CuriosTiger> with the gun rack
[20:47:55] <CuriosTiger> you're not gonna change that.
[20:48:35] <CuriosTiger> bin: The BMW I just bought had regular Texas plates on it.
[20:48:39] <CuriosTiger> bin: It now has this: http://terex.bigrig.org/BMW_530i.jpeg
[20:49:13] <bin> nice
[20:49:20] <bin> yeah that's similar to how they do it in NY
[20:49:44] <CuriosTiger> Now, my antique tag is unrestricted.
[20:49:59] <CuriosTiger> Florida also has a street rod tag that IS restricted, but the difference is only in whether you pay an annual renewal or not.
[20:50:11] <bin> https://dmv.ny.gov/learn-about-historical-and-vintage-plates
[20:50:20] <bin> interestingn
[20:50:24] <CuriosTiger> but since Florida has no inspections for any class of vehicle, it doesn't matter.
[20:50:27] <bin> yeah
[20:50:41] <bin> is catalytic converter theft a big problem in FL these days
[20:50:46] <CuriosTiger> Yes.

[21:09:13] <bin> well one of the reasons tbh
[21:09:15] <bin> not the only reason
[21:09:19] <CuriosTiger> somehow, the BMW is the one with the sooty tailpipes.
[21:09:25] <blkshp> Are your cars not interchangable?
[21:09:36] <blkshp> can you not run it on "regular" or "premium"?
[21:09:43] <CuriosTiger> higher-octane fuel isn't any cleaner, it's just less liable to predetonate.
[21:09:47] <bin> it depends on how the engine is tuned
[21:09:57] <CuriosTiger> blkshp: The BMW will retard its timing if it starts detecting knock
[21:10:12] <bin> ^^ you can really mess up some cars by putting low octane gas
[21:10:15] <CuriosTiger> so technically, I can run it on regular, but BMW doesn't recommend it and it voids the warranty (which is long expired anyway)
[21:10:16] <bin> or gas with high ethanol content
[21:10:26] <CuriosTiger> Ethanol almost caused a car fire for me back in the day
[21:10:28] <bin> esp older cars
[21:10:45] <CuriosTiger> Chrysler had used a plastic composite fuel rail that dissolved upon contact with ethanol
[21:10:55] <CuriosTiger> when Texas added 2% ethanol to all pump gas, this caused a number of car fires

[21:11:02] <CuriosTiger> I smelled gas and stopped before my car caught fire
[21:11:08] <CuriosTiger> but it was spraying fuel all over the engine compartment
[21:11:10] <blkshp> Oh, it says regular is 87 octane? is that right?
[21:11:14] <bin> yeah
[21:11:18] <CuriosTiger> Regular in the US is 87 octane
[21:11:23] <blkshp> wow
[21:11:24] <CuriosTiger> that corresponds more or less to UK 91 octane
[21:11:33] <CuriosTiger> the measurements are done using two different methods
[21:11:35] <blkshp> I have never seen less than 95
[21:11:52] <CuriosTiger> The UK has 95/97/98 now I think
[21:11:59] <CuriosTiger> there used to be 91 and 93 as well, but that's gone.
[21:12:12] <pussipupu> 95 and 98 are the main standards across Europe pretty much now I think
[21:12:19] <CuriosTiger> (Assuming the UK does the same thing as the rest of Europe)
[21:12:32] <CuriosTiger> pussipupu: No more mid-grade?
[21:12:56] <pussipupu> Don't think so, but it's not like I've left the country recently
[21:13:01] <blkshp> Super unleaded - 97
[21:13:16] <pussipupu> Ah OK, here it's 98
[21:13:34] <pussipupu> I must have remembered wrong, it's a long time since I've bought UK dinosaur blood
[21:13:38] <CuriosTiger> also, in Europe, 98 octane is usually ethanol-free
[21:13:51] <CuriosTiger> in the US, 95 octane (our "super") has ethanol in it. :-(
[21:14:04] <CuriosTiger> but there is a fuel you can buy called REC90 that does not have ethanol
[21:14:18] <bin> some places have this in racing areas: https://www.southbayriders.com/forums/attachments/541157/
[21:14:25] <CuriosTiger> it's 90-octane and meant for "recreational" use -- which means everything from boats and snowmobiles to lawnmowers.
[21:14:31] <blkshp> There's a new one coming out soon that's gonna be more environmentally friendly something 10
[21:14:38] <pussipupu> 95 and 98 here both have ethanol
[21:14:51] <pussipupu> 95 is e10 and 98 is e5 unless that's backwards
[21:14:56] <bin> There's too much ethanol in gas these days
[21:14:58] <CuriosTiger> Ugh.
[21:15:06] <CuriosTiger> yep, and they keep trying to increase it.
[21:15:07] <CuriosTiger> I hate that.
[21:15:08] <blkshp> E10 apparentl
[21:15:09] <blkshp> yes.
[21:15:34] <bin> CuriosTiger: same. It's just a terrible way of subsidizing more corn
[21:15:37] <pussipupu> A company is planning to start building solar powered cars here(that's the headline of course, no the fact)
[21:15:47] <pussipupu> If it were true presumably they wouldn't run in winter
[21:16:07] <CuriosTiger> you're north of the arctic circle?
[21:16:24] <blkshp> I will continue with the E5
[21:16:26] <pussipupu> No but there's not a lot of sun
[21:16:36] <bin> you don't hve to be north of the circle to have a massive decrease in sun in the Winter
[21:16:45] <pussipupu> Certainly not if you also want to heat the cabin
[21:17:18] <CuriosTiger> Sure, you have a decrease, but you get SOMe.
[21:17:39] <CuriosTiger> the only sensible way to do solar panels on a car is in conjunction with a battery and some backup charging system
[21:17:41] <CuriosTiger> like plugin
[21:18:10] <pussipupu> I'm pretty sure(they're a real auto company, and build real cars) that it's a top-up thing
[21:18:28] <pussipupu> Might well mean you can keep the batteries topped up when you're at the summer cottage, which would be a useful thing

[21:18:54] <CuriosTiger> get solar panels to cover most of my electricity needs, but stay hooked up to the grid as a backup
[21:19:06] <CuriosTiger> I'm just waiting for the cost to come down more
[21:19:42] <pussipupu> Yeah us too, we even have a spare room in the basement we could turn into the house battery
[21:20:05] <pussipupu> Though it would be seasonal, in summer we could significantly overproduce in winter we'd buy almost all our electrickery
[21:22:54] <TechTest> there some good things about sun
[21:23:00] <TechTest> but overall I hate it
[21:30:53] <CuriosTiger> I like it so much that I moved to the Sunshine State
[21:31:02] <CuriosTiger> Florida definitely gets more sunlight than I'm used to from Norway
[21:31:48] <pussipupu> I love the climate here honestly, such seasons many wow

[22:15:43] <pussipupu> Is “key” there American for “quay”?
[22:16:47] <CuriosTiger> It's American for "cayo", which is a Spanish loan word
[22:17:26] <pussipupu> Ah right, presumably from the same root at some remove
[22:17:28] <TimMc> It's related.
[22:17:28] *** Joins: milosz (~milosz@user/milosz)
[22:17:37] <CuriosTiger> Probably from the same Latin root ultimately, I'm guessing.
[22:17:46] <CuriosTiger> Oh. Apparently not.
[22:18:05] <CuriosTiger> According to Wikipedia, cayo came from Taino, an indigenous language.
[22:18:15] <pussipupu> Huh, cool
[22:18:37] <CuriosTiger> that would make the resemblance to "quay" simply coincidence
[22:19:04] <CuriosTiger> quay from from Proto-Celtic.

[22:19:15] <tinsoldier> C​uriosTiger meant: quay comes from Proto-Celtic.
[22:19:24] <TimMc> In the Bahamas there were "keys" but they were pronounced /'keɪ/

[22:24:03] <TimMc> Wikipedia on "quay": « Before it changed to its current form under influence of the modern French quai, its Middle English spelling was key, keye or caye. »
[22:24:27] <TimMc> That's the part that mislead me -- quite the convergence.
[22:24:54] <TimMc> oh, no, this part: « This in turn also came from the Old Norman cai (Old French chai)[citation needed], both roughly meaning "sand bank". »
[22:24:57] <CuriosTiger> TimMc: Yes, "cay" is an alternative spelling, although not one I see used in Florida.
[22:25:06] <CuriosTiger> but I could certainly believe the Bahamas uses it.
[22:25:23] <CuriosTiger> And yeah, it's a wonderful coincidence.
[22:25:39] <CuriosTiger> I had assumed there was a Latin root behind both, and as it turns out, neither one is Latin.
[22:25:48] <TimMc> That "citation needed", though.
[22:26:05] <CuriosTiger> "sand bank" is not the meaning in Taino either
[22:26:42] <CuriosTiger> In Taino, it meant something more like islet.
[22:27:13] <CuriosTiger> Oh, and if you look at https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/key -- etymology 2: Variant of cay, from Spanish cayo, from Taíno cayo (“small island”); etymology 3 Alternative form of quay.
