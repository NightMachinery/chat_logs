[05:38:15] <biys> dug out this old microsoft keyboard
[05:38:18] <biys> lovin the click click
[05:38:35] <biys> i've been using a bluetooth compact keyboard for so long though
[05:38:40] <biys> idk if my typing will ever go back to normal
[05:38:46] <biys> maybe i'll pull the dvorak keyboard out
[05:39:22] <biys> before we learned to walk we could cross check properly
[05:39:32] <biys> rockin plaid jackets, chainsaws we operate 'em right
[05:39:58] <biys> I_Am_M00t: i'm really hung up on this Hamlet though
[05:40:09] <biys> i really don't think the to be or not to be soliloquay is about suicide
[05:40:54] <biys> i think it's more-so existential angst
[05:41:19] <biys> you ever get put in between a rock and a hard place?
[05:41:28] <biys> and you kind of go a little mad at trying to logic your way out of it
[05:41:30] <biys> someone's getting hurt
[05:41:32] <biys> or something
[05:41:42] <biys> then as a result of that, frustration
[05:41:47] <biys> why does the world need to be so shitty!
[05:42:09] <biys> then he goes off on ophelia
[05:43:18] <I_Am_M00t> wtf biys ur on high gear
[05:43:32] <biys> i don't really think so

[08:06:54] <vaquero> amigojapan:  definietly, i started doing a gratitude list as well. theyve done studies and found people are generally happier after doing gratitude lists and i think its as simple as we often forget to acknowledge the good in life
[08:07:48] <amigojapan> vaquero: I will try that out
[08:08:32] <vaquero> i cant remember who i was listening to and he was talking about on average religious people tend to be happier and he says alot of it has to do with alot of modern religions often tell people to reflect and be grateful for what they have and getting in the simple practice of being grateful when things go well can help give you a more positive outlook on life
[08:10:23] <amigojapan> vaquero: hmm what about when things are not going well?

[08:11:35] <amigojapan> Oh hey darklambda
[08:11:53] <vaquero> even more important time to remember to show gratitude. "We don’t control the world around us we control how we respond to it." - some guy whose quote i felt was good enough to remember
[08:12:30] <vaquero> obviously within reason tho, like if your being raped and beaten daily then you prob cant just think positively to make that better
[08:12:43] <amigojapan> vaquero: I feel it is hard to show gratitude while you are suffering
[08:12:59] <amigojapan> Maybe after
[08:13:12] <vaquero> if it was easy then we wouldnt need to remind ourselves to do it
[08:13:24] <amigojapan> Ok
[08:14:38] <amigojapan> vaquero: I have a few people i am particularly grateful to. Maybe I should make a point in showing it
[08:17:47] <vaquero> yeah man, i dont know about you but i often get lost in negativity so i try my best to remind myself to be happy.  especially in these times where covids shutting every thing down and the news never has anything positive to say
[08:25:09] <amigojapan> vaquero: I don't watch news
[08:25:47] <amigojapan> vaquero: yeah I guess I get stuck in negativity too

[09:36:01] <pussipupu> Like amigojapan said above, mindfulness meditation can help with this, because you're practicing exactly that

[09:37:43] <amigojapan> pussipupu: it's not very helpful if you are in pain or hungry
