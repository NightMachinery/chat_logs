[01:27:56] <Demosthenex> is there a way to add BCC: to myself when sending, based on matching the subject line?
[01:29:29] <ajak> you're sort of already bcc'd on everything you send thanks to a record folder
[01:32:05] <Demosthenex> ajak: trying to track a thread in my inbox.
[01:35:36] <Demosthenex> i just wanted if i have a subject matching "TODO|DONE" then add myself to bcc
[01:36:56] <ajak> why is tracking a thread in a normal way not possible?
[01:37:15] <Demosthenex> what do you consider normal?
[01:40:10] <ajak> without any bcc shenanigans
[01:40:30] <ajak> i can just see messages that are attached to a thread with my eyes by default, not hard to track threads
[01:40:44] <Demosthenex> ajak: ok, so i send an email with a subject "TODO: XYZ" to my team. if i don't BCC myself, then the thread view is incomplete missing my replies.
[01:40:54] <Demosthenex> of course i'm saving it all to sentmail
[01:41:03] <ajak> oh i see
[01:43:37] <Demosthenex> doesn't look like i could have msmtp add it on send either
[01:43:59] <Demosthenex> i saw some ML posts about it on mutt user list, but didn't see a solution
[02:04:09] <kevin8t8> Demosthenex: you might see if fcc-hook could meet your needs.  if $fcc_delimiter is set you can specify more than one mailbox.
[02:08:22] <Demosthenex> kevin8t8: in addition to the sentmail, or rerouting? i've never heard of fcc
[02:10:19] <kevin8t8> Demosthenex: fcc-hook is used to control where the message is saved after sending, as an alternative to just setting $record
[02:17:09] <Demosthenex> kevin8t8: ok, just a reroute of the save. i'll consider that

[21:34:14] <kevin8t8> ajak: I don't think anyone will react badly to you doing so - I believe Thunderbird does it by default.
[21:35:17] <ajak> curious, if other clients do that, why not mutt?
[21:39:23] <rwp> If you have ever been on a large distribution list and had someone group follow-up to all with "Please take me off this list." creating a storm of those then you will learn why it isn't the default.
[21:40:19] <rwp> The choice of reply to sender only and group follow-up to all really is a decision that can only be made by knowing the context of the message.
[21:44:07] <kevin8t8> I think he meant <group-reply> vs <group-chat-reply>.  For that, there was a discussion on the mutt-users list, around 11/2018-12/2018 which you're welcome to peruse.
[21:44:58] <kevin8t8> Suffice to say there wasn't nearly enough consensus, even in the small response sample, to consider changing the default.
[21:49:41] <rwp> Oh!  I was thinking of group-reply and actually did not know about group-chat-reply at all.  Because I have been using mutt for a long time, and don't read about feature updates.
[21:50:37] <rwp> I'll try out group-chat-reply now that I have read the docs on it and then I will have experience with how it works.
[21:50:42] <kevin8t8> Well, for your initial understanding I completely agree with your response :^)
[21:50:44] <rwp> Thanks for pointing out that I was talking about the wrong thing.

[21:54:15] <rwp> I always set edit_headers and therefore those appear in my $EDITOR and then I modify them as I desire when responding.  (I had to look up my configuration to remember my setting.)
