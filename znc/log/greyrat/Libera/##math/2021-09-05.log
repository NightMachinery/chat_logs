[00:17:37] <qergle> it's the population variance of the freq of that plaintext. not sure what meaningful means. it's a datum they want.
[00:19:07] <tusko> I see, so the text is a population of characters. And the variance is telling us how much it differs from a uniformly distributed plaintext(?)
[00:19:58] <qergle> it's telling you a measure of spread from the mean of 1/26
[00:20:37] <tusko> I guess I don't know exactly what the datum is supposed to be telling us. Maybe that its variance being similar to that of the known frequences of english language chars suggests it may be English text itself.

[01:08:56] <int-e> having % 122 in there instead of % 26 basically guarantees that it's wrong

[02:11:37] <W> jpearse, what do recurring decimals mean?
[02:11:38] <riv> jpearse, it goes back to how real numbers are defined as limits

[02:12:16] <riv> the limit of the sequence (1, 1, 1, ...) is the same as the limit of the sequence (0.9, 0.99, 0.999, 0.9999, ...)
[02:12:19] <jpearse> yeah i'm starting with the basics. i'm watching a youtube video on how the reals are constructed using dedekind cuts in order to get a good foundation.
[02:12:37] <riv> I find cauchy sequences much more intuitive than dedekind cuts
[02:13:07] <riv> (a sequence is cauchy if the values in it get closer and closer)
[02:13:18] <greenbagels> i think it's more of a representation issue than a number issue idk
[02:13:20] <riv> so those 2 i listed are cauchy and (1, 2, 3, 4, ...) is not
[02:15:41] <jpearse> thanks riv i'll see if there's a video which goes through cauchy stuff.
[02:15:51] <greenbagels> riv: you run into this issue even if you define rationals fwiw

[02:18:23] <riv> not sure what you mean greenbagels
[02:18:40] <kakuhen> it's easier to understand things like 0.999... = 1 if you first construct reals as (equivalence classes of) cauchy sequences of rationals
[02:18:50] <riv> oh you're saying that 0.19999999.. is a rational number
[02:19:10] <riv> I think that is true but only after you have developed real numbers
[02:19:32] <riv> How would you assign meaning to 0.19999999.. without defining reals first
[02:20:06] <kakuhen> ^
[02:20:23] <kakuhen> the usual construction of rationals is with (equivalence classes of) ordered pairs of integers
[02:20:38] <kakuhen> and with 0.1999... well, you don't really have a fixed integer in either part of the pair

[02:35:54] <TheWild> folks, wtf? I've factored x^255 + 1 and either there's a bug in the program, or in fact it yields all irreducible polynomials of degree 1, 2, 4 and 8.
[02:36:42] <riv> first of all, x^255+1 is not irreducible over Q
[02:37:37] *** Quits: arseniiv (~arseniiv@136.169.204.31) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[02:39:12] <TheWild> x^255 + 1 is reducible over GF(2) as well. Thing is, it is really surprising to see *all* the irreducible polynomials of degrees 1, 2, 4, 8 to be the factors
[02:39:30] <riv> reducible over Q is stronger
[02:40:40] *** Quits: qedo (~Shimon@bzq-84-108-229-161.cablep.bezeqint.net) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[02:41:04] <int-e> TheWild: yeah that happens. it's related to 255 being the order of the multiplicative group of GF(2^8), 15 of GF(2^4), 3 of GF(2^2) and 1 of GF(2^1), and that all these orders divide 255.
[02:41:29] <int-e> It's better to think of the polynomial as x^255-1, so you can see its relation to roots of unity.
[02:41:33] <riv> F_{p^r} is the splitting field of X^(p^r) - X over F_p. So you will get every irreducible polynomial over F_p with degree p^k (k < r) in there. It is different to your poly but close..

[02:42:40] <int-e> In this picture, the roots of x^256-x are exactly the elements of GF(2^8)... so the roots of x^255-1 are the non-zero elements of that same field.
[02:44:26] <int-e> Over Q, well, substituting -x for x in x^255+1 gives -x^255+1 which is associated with x^255-1.
[02:44:56] <riv> oh yeah, x^255 + 1 = x^255 - 1
[02:45:00] <riv> mod 2

[03:44:40] *** Quits: oxum (~oxum@106.203.195.217) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[03:45:03] <droid3> Usually we study those applied to quadratic 2 of cubic 3 residue problems
[03:46:11] <droid3> there is 2 inter-related questions 1) the existence of an nth root 2) finding all nth roots for a given number mod some n.
[03:47:06] <droid3> logically existence is no harder then actually finding the roots interms of computational complexity
[03:47:10] <droid3> this is obvious
[03:48:09] <droid3> But how much better can we do with computers in answering 1) vs 2)? They seem both to be in general NP.
[03:49:04] <droid3> Only in certain cases like 2 and 3 do we have some nice polynomial time stuff. But not for the general 1) existence of nth roots 2) finding all nth roots problems
[03:49:35] <droid3> Anybody interested in discussing this stuff. That what the brainstorming topics going to be on tonight
[03:50:56] <droid3> curious a side question does anybody know if its much harder problems if the object where more general aka not working with finite fields.
[03:51:40] <droid3> But with working with commutative rings with unity
[03:53:04] *** Quits: Crescendo (~Crescendo@user/crescendo) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[03:53:56] <droid3> to me it seems that nth roots and nth residues problems mostly rely groups which is more fundamental then finite rings or finite fields
[03:54:07] *** Joins: Crescendo (~Crescendo@user/crescendo)
[03:54:18] <droid3> property wise that is.
[03:55:09] <[itchyjunk]> I suspect my answer is incorrect because i expect the roots to repeat past k = 2
[03:55:37] <[itchyjunk]> but for k = 3, i would get 2pi which would be (-1+0)
[03:55:44] <[itchyjunk]> so -4^(1/3)
[03:55:49] <[itchyjunk]> so my roots are not repeating
[03:55:54] *** Joins: oxum (~oxum@106.203.195.217)
[03:56:49] <droid3> itchyjunk your talking about the problem over Q or a infinite field. That question is more obvious with newtons roots algorithm ...etc.
[03:57:45] <droid3> Plus we naturally know how to compute and determine if a number is a root of another number in Q to some approximation. And we usually solve this question symbolically.
[03:58:41] <droid3> I am talking about the nth root and nth reciprocity for finite fields or more general finite objects
[03:59:10] <droid3> Finite fields are the obvious thing to look at first because we know how to classify all finite fields.

[04:01:02] <droid3> Also since polynomial arithmetic can be put into one to one relations/isomorphism to a finite field.
[04:01:47] <droid3> we pretty much know that the problem for finite fields is either Zp or Zp[x]/<irred poly>
[04:02:01] <[itchyjunk]> z \in C
[04:02:24] <[itchyjunk]> Q is an infinite field
[04:03:12] <droid3> so its asking how to find nth roots and nth reciprocity in the setting of Zp or  Zp[x]/<irred poly> when i say finite fields.

[04:03:56] <droid3> because ALL finite fields reduce down to arithmetic with those two type of objects
[04:04:17] <[itchyjunk]> omg i am an idiot
[04:04:27] <[itchyjunk]> i was saying 2pi and looking at values of pi
[04:04:53] <droid3> itchyjunk Q is infinite field and i was restricting the talk for a little bit on finite things aka finite rings , finite fields , finite groups ,...etc for those two problems.
[04:05:31] <droid3> I think itchyjunk your calculating nth roots of unity over the complex number field.
[04:05:44] <[itchyjunk]> yes i am
[04:05:48] <droid3> which that is an even larger infinite field then the rationals.
[04:06:03] <[itchyjunk]> yes C is algebriacally closed
[04:06:07] <[itchyjunk]> Q and R aren't
[04:06:27] <[itchyjunk]> my answers work, i roughly verified them
[04:07:10] <droid3> ya so in those cases because C is algebraically closed we always have nth residues and abilities to find nth roots. So its not as interesting in those type of fields.
[04:07:44] <droid3> First off algebraic closure implies there will always be a nth root for any element in C.
[04:08:22] <droid3> And Q and R still are pretty easy to determine if there is an nth root or the nth reciprocity problem in those fields.
[04:09:09] <droid3> As there what we naturally work with so its not interesting of a problem talking about nth roots and nth reciprocity problems in the context of those fields.
[04:09:49] <droid3> The finite fields are where its much more interesting problem itchyjunk i hope you get what i am saying.

[06:27:06] <Fangs> and they said the action of G is by right multiplication
[06:27:58] <Fangs> meaning given g in Q8 the quartenion, then g acts on f(x) to f(xg)
[06:28:21] <Fangs> so if you have some basis function f1(x) and f2(x) and say you look at i-action on this function you'll get i as an eigenvalue for both f1 and f2

[07:40:39] <loopspace> It seems to me that 1.1 is meant to represent the extension problem and 1.2 the lifting problem. In the former, I'd expect i to behave as an inclusion, and in the latter, to to behave as projection. In the latter, we're dealing with a quotient space, and identification topology

[07:43:09] <Fangs> loopspace: maybe you mistook them as saying that it was a sufficient condition?
[07:43:49] <Fangs> loopspace: lets consider 1.1, suppose taht i(a) = \pt for all a in A, and f: A -> Y is not in general, then there can be no lift
[07:43:58] <Fangs> unless f(A) = pt too
[07:44:21] <Fangs> so I think 1.1 pairs with 1.3, and 1.2 pairs with 1.4
[07:45:11] <Fangs> ok lets be more explicit, suppose i(a) = pt, and f: A -> Y has two points a1, a2 such that f(a1) =/= f(a2), then g(i(a1)) = g(i(a2))

[07:46:20] <Fangs> as for the sentence after 1.3 and 1.4, I think 1.3 is specifically talking about this identification.. that f(a1) = f(a2) means i(a1) = i(a2) (or something to that effect) then this is fine
[07:47:16] <Fangs> loopspace: I think the sentence after 1.3 is basically saying if you have a map R -> S^1 given by t \mapsto e^it, then you can make X into a quotient space X/~, where a1~a2 iff f(a1) = f(a2)

[07:47:41] <loopspace> Right. And that's why it belongs with 1.4, not 1.3 AFAICT
[07:48:03] <Fangs> loopspace: no that's 1.3 surely

[07:48:42] <Fangs> or rather, i: A -> A/~

[07:52:02] <Fangs> the statement of 1.3 is a very VERY weak statement. its a necessary but not sufficient condition

[07:53:29] <loopspace> IN the beginning of the paragraph after 1.3 it says: if in addition i maps A upon X.

[07:54:14] <loopspace> So let i be an inclusion
[07:54:21] <Fangs> then 1.3 is vacuous
[07:54:43] <loopspace> I'm talking about that phrase in the paragraph after 1.3, not 1.3

[07:55:21] <Fangs> loopspace: the paragraph is only interesting when its NOT the extention problem

[07:56:09] <loopspace> I think we are interested in the extension/lifting problems, and that those paragraphs are meant to be interesting in those cases.
[07:56:18] <loopspace> For example: consider the lifting case

[07:58:34] <[-_-]> once I confirm A matrix is diagonizable, can I just put the eigen values on a diagonal matrix?
[07:58:56] <Fangs> loopspace: they're talking about left and right factorization problems in general, I dont think they're *only* interested in the extension/lifting problems
[07:59:19] <loopspace> Correct. But, there is something interesting in those subcases, and it's consistent with those paragraphis being swapped
[07:59:33] <loopspace> AFAICT
[08:00:16] <loopspace> But part of why I asked was for a reality check, so I'll stare at it some more since you don't immediately agree that there's a problem, and i would have expected someone to have found it by now

[08:01:48] <Fangs> the former case is interesting, but then you woudln't say 1.4 was a necessary condition for 1.1
[08:02:12] <Fangs> in the latter case, the sentence after 1.4 doesn't pair nor explain why 1.3 is necessary for 1.1

[08:03:57] <loopspace> I have to think of the best way to untangle. But first impression would be that 1.3 reads me me exactly like the condition involved when employing universality arguments involving identification topologies so maybe I will end up arguing that 1.3 and the paragraph after, with some modifications need to be associated with 1.2. I'll try to get more clear if that's right--at the moment it just seems off as is
[08:04:23] <Fangs> nw
[08:04:38] <loopspace> It'll force me to fully understand before I can rephrase (or see my error). Not the most efficient way to learn, but still smells funny to me

[10:53:48] <Fangs> We outline our strategy as follow. Note that if $n = 2m$, then there exists a quotient map $D_{2m} \to D_m$ with kernel the center of $D_{2m}$. This suggest that we should start with the dihedral groups $D_n$ with odd $n$, and inductively consider the representations induced from the map $D_{2^{k+1} n} \to D_{2^{k} n} $

[13:21:13] * int-e thinks that one needs a fixed distribution for the initial state for this.
[13:21:14] <CuriousErnestBro> or in maths: X_n+1 independent with X_n-1, ..., X_0 conditionally on X_n
[13:21:45] <int-e> CuriousErnestBro: it doesn't even work; if you stay in the state then P(A_(n+1)|A_n) = 1, but isn't it supposed to be 0
[13:21:46] <CuriousErnestBro> int-e I see, in the exercise, the initial state is given to be A
[13:22:32] <int-e> CuriousErnestBro: Okay. That's great. You can focus on the second step then and violate the Markov property on that step.
[13:22:35] <CuriousErnestBro> int-e I meant, after 8 n's it gets swapped out for the original transition matrix
[13:23:24] <cherim> I don't think you are on the same wavelength with the problem setter
[13:23:46] <CuriousErnestBro> sorry, I keep repeating my sleeping example when it's the wrong direction
[13:24:11] <int-e> CuriousErnestBro: You can *never* stay at the same place during a transition, because the (first-order) probability for that is 0.

[15:26:46] <riv> no, that's just the identity permutation
[15:26:56] <CuriousErnestBro> I lose handwritten notes fast
[15:27:05] <riv> it is an even permutation
[15:27:47] <cherim> Initial distribution is a part of the Markov chain, it's not clear what "The structure of Markov chain is independent of the initial distribution" even means
[15:28:09] <cherim> The last probability (X3=A...X0=B) is not even defined
[15:28:24] <cherim> If X0=A with probability 1
[15:29:14] <cherim> And the very framework is strange, you seem to take the process described in the statement, not modify it in any way, and show some "violation of Markov property"
[15:29:24] <cadmio1> I count 3 out of 7 even odd permutations

[15:30:31] <riv> that should get you started, ones we have already done
[15:30:50] <riv> you're right
[15:30:57] <CuriousErnestBro> cherim the original process has no mention of an initial distribution.  The sentence that's unclear I copy pasted from wikipedia, I asked above what it meant, no one answered so I put in in the "probably clear for the reader"-box.
[15:31:29] <cherim> Wasn't it said "starts at A"?
[15:31:35] <CuriousErnestBro> cherim I construct the initial distribution P(X_0 = A) = 1 to create a violation of the Markov property.
[15:31:45] <cherim> Show the original problem
[15:32:04] <CuriousErnestBro> http://0x0.st/-wPL.png
[15:33:32] <cherim> Ok. So which is your process? "Markov chain, but with fixed start at A"?
[15:33:38] <cadmio1> 5 e, 1+1+1+1+1 e, 2+2+1 e, 3+1+1 e
[15:33:42] <cadmio1> the others are odd
[15:33:46] <cherim> Clearly it will be Markov, by construction
[15:34:06] <riv> cadmio1, correct! That's a good answer
[15:34:21] <riv> cadmio1, so there are 4 conjugacy classes of even permutations in S_5
[15:34:32] <riv> but when we move to A_5, some of these conjugacy classes can split
[15:34:43] <riv> do you see why a conjugacy class would split in A_5 (a subgroup of S_5)?
[15:34:57] <CuriousErnestBro> cherim The initial distribution X_0 is undefined in the question, at part (b) they say "Suppose the driver begins at the airport at time 0."
[15:35:25] <cherim> Part (c) asks to construct a process. What is your process?
[15:36:09] <cherim> It may be the case that they hadn't specified their process completely anywhere, but that's irrelevant
[15:36:15] <CuriousErnestBro> P(X_0 = A) = 1, with the same first order transition matrix and same state space {A, B, C}
[15:36:54] <cadmio1> no I don't see it
[15:36:55] <cherim> And this is directly a definition of a Markov chain, with a given starting distribution and transition matrix?

[15:39:33] <CuriousErnestBro> As far as I know I constructed a process which may or may not be Markov.
[15:40:10] <CuriousErnestBro> Showing that it violates the Markov property shows that it isn't Markov, in case my calculations are correct.
[15:40:41] <cherim> Your calculations aren't, see " if both conditional probabilities are well defined, that is" at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete-time_Markov_chain
[15:41:01] <CuriousErnestBro> I suspected that...
[15:41:40] <cherim> You can't even consider P(x3=A...X0=B) if X0=A with probability 1
[15:41:49] <CuriousErnestBro> That is true.

[15:42:39] <CuriousErnestBro> cherim that same page says: These descriptions highlight the structure of the Markov chain that is independent of the initial distribution P(X_0=x_0)
[15:42:45] <riv> https://bpa.st/LGFA here is the calculation
[15:43:28] <CuriousErnestBro> I read that as: independence on X_0 is necessary for a process to be Markov. Now exactly what is independent, I don't know, it's unclear.
[15:43:40] *** Joins: kakashiAL (~kakashi@aftr-62-216-211-83.dynamic.mnet-online.de)
[15:43:52] <cherim> But also whenever you take any finite state space, any probability distribution for X0 on it, and any matrix P (non-negative, rows sum to 1), and use it as a transition matrix using the rule "whenever I am at i, next time I go to j with probability p_{ij}", you will get a Markov process
[15:43:57] <cadmio1> the conjugacy classes of A_5 should be 5
[15:44:46] <riv> right, because 5 splits and provides 2, 1+1+1+1+1 does not split provides 1, 2+2+1 does not split provides 1, 3+1+1 does not split provides 1

[15:46:57] <CuriousErnestBro> cherim so, the answer is no, every process with a transition matrix and finite state space is Markovian by definition.
[15:47:04] <CuriousErnestBro> It's a trick question.
[15:47:06] <cherim> No
[15:47:18] <CuriousErnestBro> And there is no implicit assumption.
[15:47:40] <riv> e.g. in S_5 we have (1,2,3,4,5)^(5,4) = (1,2,3,5,4)
[15:47:43] <cherim> "whenever I am at i, next time I go to j with probability p_{ij}" is not the same as having fixed P(X_n=a | X_{n-1}=b)
[15:47:55] <riv> but in A_5 there is no way to get (1,2,3,4,5)^g = (1,2,3,5,4)

[17:37:14] <[itchyjunk]> "determine all the complex solutions of the equation"

[17:37:50] <[itchyjunk]> oh maybe i have an idea

[17:41:41] <[itchyjunk]> it repeats..
[17:42:03] <int-e> cherim: Actually what you describe is a counterexample to my claim with a minor tweak: reset the process every 3 steps... the point is that the Markov property is already violated after 3 steps, P(X_3 = B | X_{0..2} = ACA) = 0 != 1 = P(X_3 = B | X_{0..2} = ABA), but the first-order transition matrix on that step still agrees with the Markov process.
[17:42:10] <[itchyjunk]> so z^3 = -1 => z = e ^ (pi/3 + 2 pi k ) i, right?
[17:42:29] <[itchyjunk]> and therfore, k \in {0,1,2} should give me 3 distinct roots.
[17:42:41] <[itchyjunk]> but k = 0 and k = 1 gives me the same root..
[17:42:54] <Gurkenglas> in full generality, what happens when you do (A->B)->B? (X->Bool)->Bool seems like it describes topology, (p->False)->False is equivalent to p in classical logic but not intuitionistic logic, whether a banach space is reflexive says whether doing this changes it, ...
[17:43:15] <Z-module> [itchyjunk]: you earlier write  z = e^(pi/3 + 2pi k) i   though first of all, the i is part of the exponent:  z = e^((pi/3 + 2pi k) i)    and you were thinking for all integers k, right? The problem here is that no matter what integer k is, this expression gives the same single complex value. What you *should* have said is   e^((pi/3 + (2pi/3)k) i)   for all k. Then using k = 0,1,2  gives three distinct values, where any other k gives
[17:43:15] <Z-module> the same as one of those three. *These* are all the roots you need.  There are the same as   [e^(i pi/3)] [e^(i k 2pi/3)]  where k = 0,1,2, which expresses:  a single cube root of -1 (that first bracketed thing), times each of the possible cube roots of 1.
[17:43:58] <[itchyjunk]> ohhhhhhhhhh
[17:44:01] <cherim> int-e: I wanted to tweak by singling out X1 (i.e. only X->Y transitions with X, Y != X1 are altered by preferring prior choices, maybe with 4 states or such)
[17:44:01] <mornfall> [itchyjunk]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Visualisation_complex_number_roots.svg might help, though it's kinda messy
[17:44:38] <[itchyjunk]> doh
[17:45:00] <Gurkenglas> (a topology morphism (A->Bool)->Bool to (B->Bool)->Bool is an A->B such that the triangle (B->Bool)->(A->Bool)->Bool has a 2-cell in it)
[17:46:02] <Z-module> So in general to find all n complex nth roots of some nonzero w, first find a single root z, then look at all "rotations" of z by multiples of a single turn through 1/nth of a full circle, in other words, z times all the possible   e^(i 2pi k/n)    (k = 0,1,...,n-1)
[17:46:54] <[itchyjunk]> right 1/nth the full circle
[17:47:07] <[itchyjunk]> ofcourse i get same value if i rotate by 2pi multiples each time
[17:47:49] <Z-module> 2pi/n is a single nth of a circle,   2pi k/n  is that thing iterated k times,   e^(i 2pi k/n)  is the actual complex number that has the effect of rtotating anything by that k nths of a circle (when you use it multiplicatively).
[17:47:56] <riv> z^3 = -1 is z^3 + 1 = 0
[17:48:08] <riv> the solutions of that are the negatives of the solutions to z^3 - 1 = 0
[17:48:13] <Z-module> THinking of that number as   cos(2pi k/n) + i sin(2pi k/n)   is "correct" but to me a lot less conceptually clear what it's doing.

[18:30:03] <CuriousErnestBro> except it's not the same transition matrix
[18:30:40] <cherim> So what is the process?
[18:30:59] <CuriousErnestBro> okay, here's the process: the taxi driver always visits A on even integers for time
[18:31:34] <cherim> Start time (fixed at A) is 0 or 1?
[18:31:38] <CuriousErnestBro> 0
[18:32:09] <cherim> Then P(X_2=C|X_1=B)=0? He goes to A from B?
[18:32:33] <CuriousErnestBro> Yes, that's the problem

[20:01:36] <riv> even though it is conjugate in S_3

[23:32:39] <riv> so with tan(x)=t, dx = cos(x)^2 dt
[23:32:48] <riv> and I get the integrand cos(x)^3/(2 + cos(x)) dt
[23:33:41] <Guest84> Can someone help me understand why <Av, w> = <v, A*w> ?
[23:33:55] <riv> Guest84, that just follows easily from the definition
[23:34:01] <Guest84> :(
[23:34:11] <riv> <Av, w> = (A v)* w = v* A* w
[23:34:18] <riv> <v, A* w> = v* A* w
[23:34:27] <riv> both sides come out the same when you expand it

[23:37:15] <[itchyjunk]> argh
[23:37:26] <[itchyjunk]> my 4 became 3 magically at some point and that was my error
[23:37:27] <[itchyjunk]> wtf
[23:37:32] <int-e> Juliu: This is how <a,b> = a^T b is generalized to complex vectors.
[23:38:18] <Juliu> int-e, so <a,b> = a* b ?

[23:38:33] <int-e> yes
[23:38:44] <Guest84> why cant we use the properties of inner product?

[23:39:23] <riv> the correct result is -0.97201214975728492545102626400961716074192619362075066032980
[23:40:13] <int-e> Juliu: note that a) it's still bilinear and b) that this way, <a,a> is a non-negative real number. Both of which are very desirable properties of an inner product.
[23:40:22] <riv> the weierstrass sub gave me 2 * integrate((2 * (3 + t^2) * (1 - t^2)) / (1 + t^2)^3, t, 0, infinity)
[23:40:25] <riv> which comes out as pi
[23:40:27] <qergle> conjugate symmetry
[23:40:32] <riv> im not sure what I did wrontg
[23:40:54] <Z-module> it's not even _called_ an inner product unless <a,a> is always a real >= 0, and 0 only when a is the 0 vector
[23:41:06] <[itchyjunk]> if z = -8 - 8sqrt(3)i. is one of it's 4th root -cos(pi/12) -i sin(pi/12) ?
[23:41:31] <Guest84> I wanted to write <Av, w> = conjugate(<w,Av>)
[23:41:49] <Juliu> int-e, then I replace "*" with "^T" I understand what riv wrote. But since I never learned about complex linear algebra, ...
[23:41:50] <qergle> yes, that's conjugate symmetry
[23:41:56] <int-e> Z-module: yes I could probably have phrased that better
[23:41:58] <riv> ah I got it
[23:42:02] <riv> thanks!
[23:42:11] <qergle> <x,y>=conj(<y,x>)
[23:42:31] <Juliu> I never understood what inner and outer product really meant. I just understand the dot and cross product
[23:43:54] <[itchyjunk]> pi/12 is throwing me off
[23:44:06] <[itchyjunk]> there is no "nice" values for sin , cos with whose angles
[23:44:09] <Guest84> qergle how do i expand conjugate(<w,Av>) ? Like this: conjugate(<w,Av>) = conjugate(<w,v>A) = conjugate(<w,v>)A* = <v,w>A* = <v,A*w> ?

[23:45:32] <Z-module> [itchyjunk]:   z = 16w  where w = -1/2 - i sqrt(3)/2 = 16 e^(i 4pi/3)    so a 4th root of that is  2 e^(i pi/3) = 2 cos(pi/3) + i 2 sin(pi/3)   and then the other three 4th roots are that one times i or -1 or -i
[23:46:17] <Z-module> sorry, I meant  z = 16 e^(i 4pi/3)
[23:46:34] <[itchyjunk]> wait you didn't factor out the - and got 4pi/3
[23:46:44] <[itchyjunk]> i factored out -8 initially and got something else
[23:46:56] <[itchyjunk]> that might be the issue..
[23:47:29] <[itchyjunk]> why does that change it so much?
[23:47:39] <Guest84> riv why is (A v)* = v* A* ?
[23:48:01] <[itchyjunk]> why does kx + kiy as k(x+iy) work but not -k(-x-iy) not work?
[23:48:19] <riv> Guest84, just use the definition of *
[23:48:31] <int-e> [itchyjunk]: what do you mean by "work"?
[23:48:49] <Z-module> Guest84, in general if B is any j x k complex matrix and D is any k x n complex matrix, then  (BD)^* = D^* B^*
[23:48:57] <[itchyjunk]> well, when i factored out - i ended up with pi/3 which gave me a principle root involving pi/12
[23:48:59] <Z-module> in your case, A is n x n,  v is n x 1
[23:48:59] <Guest84> riv * means the complex conjugate.
[23:49:03] <int-e> [itchyjunk]: these three expressions are equal
[23:49:07] <[itchyjunk]> but that has no nice value and doesn't "work" it seems?
[23:49:14] <riv> Guest84, conjugate transpose of a matrix, isn't it?
[23:49:15] <[itchyjunk]> hmm maybe i made some other mistake then
[23:49:16] <Z-module> here, ^* is conjugate transpose

[23:50:13] <Z-module> Guest84, you can prove  (BD)^* = D^* B^*   directly, by seeing the formula for each entry

[23:51:06] <[itchyjunk]> so z^(1/4) = -e^i(pi/12 + pi/2 k) ?
[23:51:09] <Z-module> it's really  just  (BD)^T = D^T B^T^    and then conjugating every element of both sides of that

[23:52:03] <riv> I tried replacing (n+1)! with n! but that made it too large
[23:52:13] <int-e> [itchyjunk]: e^(ipi/4), for example
[23:52:28] <[itchyjunk]> 4th root of -1....
[23:52:38] <int-e> 4 is *not* odd, so -1 isn't a 4th root of -1.
[23:52:41] <Guest84> for a matrix product, if B is jxk and D is kxn, then BD is a jxn ?
[23:52:56] <[itchyjunk]> (-1)^(1/4) doh!
[23:53:02] <qergle> Guest84: yes
[23:53:10] <[itchyjunk]> man..
[23:53:18] <[itchyjunk]> i'll do what Z-module did and not factor out -1 haha
[23:54:49] <Z-module> remember [itchyjunk], once you have any single 4th root z of a nonzero complex w, the set of all 4 possible 4th roots is  z e^(2pi i 0/4), z e^(2pi i 1/4), z e^(2pi i 2/4),  z e^(2pi i 3/4)    and those e^(...) things there are just 1, i, -1, -i  respectively.
