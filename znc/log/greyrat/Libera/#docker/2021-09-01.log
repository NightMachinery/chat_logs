[01:18:51] <physikoi> Hello. I'm trying to dockerize an existing webproject. It's a simple one: just PHP+apache. Project root is "./" and document root is ./somethingunique. With that said, am I on the right track with my docker-compose.yml? https://hastebin.com/raw/kupizeheze
[01:19:33] <gordonjcp> physikoi: looks good
[01:20:03] <gordonjcp> physikoi: I guess you copy your project into ./somethingunique and then aim apache at it?
[01:20:10] <gordonjcp> physikoi: like, if it was on bare metal that would work as given
[01:20:17] <physikoi> I ask because, while I'm able to build, i don't see any of my files when accessing container
[01:20:40] <physikoi> gordonjcp: ok, well i think you just gave me an important hint
[01:20:48] <gordonjcp> uh-huh?
[01:21:01] <gordonjcp> you didn't populate ./somethingunique?
[01:21:14] <gordonjcp> can't say *I've* ever made that stupid mistake
[01:21:16] <gordonjcp> no no, not me
[01:21:44] <gordonjcp> "where the hell is it?  It should be right there in the mount point, it's right there in the... aw."
[01:22:47] <physikoi> lemme preface by saying that i'm a noob. OK, so on my actual machine, my project is located at /path/to/project. I was hoping that docker would just see my files under /path/to/project/somethingunique by using that docker-compose.yml. Seems i'm off the mark
[01:22:57] <physikoi> lol
[01:23:07] <gordonjcp> it should do
[01:24:01] <gordonjcp> say your structure is /home/physikoi/dockerapp/docker-compose.yml and /home/physikoi/dockerapp/webroot
[01:24:16] <gordonjcp> let me just say ~/dockerapp/ instead actually
[01:24:20] *** Joins: XV8 (~XV8@2601:5cb:c001:50:7c79:4e14:5357:7ce1)
[01:25:09] <gordonjcp> if you have in your docker-compose.yml just volume: ./webroot:/srv/www/webroot then you ought to see what's in ~/dockerapp/webroot on the host, mounted at /var/www/webroot/ in the container
[01:25:42] <physikoi> is that to say that I *shouldnt* need to mess with a Dockerfile? When i log into the container, there's nothing to be seen under /var/www
[01:26:24] <physikoi> gordonjcp: lemme digest that for a bit
[01:30:35] <physikoi> For volume, I have ./somethingunique:/var/www/ (somethingunique is webroot), should that be changed to ./somethingunique:/var/www/somethingunique? also, i see you used /srv instead of /var
[01:36:16] <physikoi> so, changing volume to "./somethingunique:/var/www/somethingunique" means i do now see the directory /var/www/wtw.paxperscientiam.com in the container. said directory just has an empty ./html folder ... but i feel like this is progress

Im trying to migrate away from making my docker images on the pis i run them on, id rather be able to make them on my computer instead its a lot quicker https://bpa.st/W3DA

[01:48:16] <SilverFox> I have the traceback w commands and my dockerfile here https://bpa.st/W3DA
[01:51:46] <physikoi> gordonjcp: idkwhy, directory in container still shows zero files
[01:52:25] <gordonjcp> odd
[01:54:02] <physikoi> yeah, i must be doing something very dumb. i just tried this minimal example and the files show up as expected in container: https://forums.docker.com/t/unable-to-mount-directories-files-from-docker-compose-oci-runtime-error-not-a-directory/10808/4
[01:56:15] <SilverFox> Read some reports online saying they solved my issue by including a missing #!/bin/bash in their entrypoint but my entrypoint is python and its failing on apt anyway BUT maybe my && and \ \ is different on arm vs amd64?...
[01:56:48] <gordonjcp> physikoi: which version of docker and docker-compose are you running?

[13:53:39] <L0j1k> yes, the utility file could give different output based on your system used, since it uses (according to man file) /usr/share/misc/magic.mgc or /usr/share/misc/magic to determine the file's contnets

[13:55:00] <L0j1k> so there is disparity between the magic numbers for that particular downloaded file. you could mount the host's magic file to the container's ${HOME}/.magic.mgc and it will supercede the system magic file in teh container, and should then give you consistent output

[14:23:31] <L0j1k> linux_daemon: why do you need your host and container magic files to be the same?

[14:51:51] <zitter> good day, people :) I have a volume 'myvolume' set on "app" container. Can I use it in "web" container. To be more specific: I have "nextcloud" image containerized with volume - nextcloud:/var/www/html but I need that /var/www/html in "webserver" container, where I have other volumes to be served as default root path in some situation.

[21:30:34] <steve> Sometimes you just need someone to point out the obvious to you, I guess

[21:31:58] <AmirKabir> Hi, can I ask my docker issues here? specifically I have a problem with the notification system 
[21:34:00] <programmerq> no need to ask to ask
[21:35:12] <AmirKabir> ok thanks

[21:36:52] <AmirKabir> So I have setup a local registry, and I want it to send notifications to localhost ( url: http://localhost )
[21:37:24] <AmirKabir> I also have netcat listening on port 80

[21:38:23] <steve> Also, within my docker-compose file, I have build: context: /some/dir   - does that change the relative path for my Dockerfile to /some/dir also? Or do I need to specify a full path for my Dockerfile?
[21:38:32] <AmirKabir> but whenever the registry tries to send a notification to localhost, it says "connection refused"

[21:40:45] <AmirKabir> This one
[21:41:21] <AmirKabir> to verify that netcat is working, I typed localhost on my browser, and netcat got the HTTP GET request along with the http header
[21:41:58] <AmirKabir> can anybody please tell how to fix this "connection refused" problem?
[21:43:48] <programmerq> steve the dockerfile location is relative to the context
[21:44:13] <programmerq> AmirKabir if you are running the registry in a container, then the container has its own localhost.
[21:44:32] <programmerq> if your netcat is running on your host, then it's running on your host's localhost, not the container's localhost.

[21:48:05] <AmirKabir> programmerq: is there a way to get notifications from my local registry?
[21:48:57] <programmerq> you'd specify an endpoint that is reachable from the container instead of localhost.
[21:51:55] <AmirKabir> programmerq: can it be a local ip?
[21:57:59] *** Quits: Enitin (~Enitin@82.102.22.85) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[21:58:36] <programmerq> sure. as long as you can reach it from the container, it'll work. The containers are basically NATed through your host for egress, so a packet to an IP on your local network that your host can get to will be reachable once the packet passes from the container to the host.
