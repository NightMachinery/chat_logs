[04:17:56] <jimeh> adam12: I’ve often ended up using geminabox with basic auth and https, sometimes on a private internal network too… but for the past year I’ve just been using GitHub Packages instead, which is a bit more tedious for auth, but less hassle overall I think, specially cause we auto push new gems with GitHub Actions whenever a git tag is pushed

[21:28:32] <jwr> adam12: yes
[21:30:18] <adam12> jwr: do you know the path where bundler installs it's gems in the first step? is it under ~/.rbenv or /app?

[21:31:30] <jwr> adam12: gems are installed in the first place in /app/vendor/bundle. if i just run `bundle` it prints a bunch of `Using somegem...` lines, with the expected gems and versions (eg. rails 6.0.3.1 is there).
[21:31:41] <adam12> jwr: interesting...
[21:40:37] <jwr> adam12: weirdly it only seems to be an issue with `bundle update`. `bundle install` works fine (in the second/final container, where all the gems are already installed).

[22:15:42] <adam12> weaksauce brings up a good point tho.
[22:17:22] <jwr> the use case for needing `bundle update` is that we do all our development in containers locally, so it's common for a deveoper to `docker exec` into a container locally and update a gem, and then push the new lockfile into our build pipeline. we don't do `bundle update` directly in prod containers or anything.

[22:29:43] <jwr> when i manually change the version in the Gemfile and do `bundle update`, bundler tells me to do `bundle install --no-deployment` instead. and when i subsequently run that, it does install. https://pastebin.com/xVPBA6Bh
[22:29:43] <ruby[bot]> jwr: as I told you already, please use https://gist.github.com
[22:30:38] <jwr> i'm not sure that changing the version in the Gemfile is a replacement for `bundle update` though, because I might just want the latest version of a gem instead of pinning a specific version in the Gemfile, and let the Gemfile.lock take care of pinning a specific one.
[22:32:02] <weaksauce> jwr well try that?
[22:32:21] <weaksauce> you are running bundle update on a specific gem version that is already installed
[22:32:53] <weaksauce> try installing that gem and then doing a more permissive pattern like > 6.0.3
