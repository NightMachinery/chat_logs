[02:08:50] <VectorX> Dharhix how about this, https://regex101.com/r/GWUvrJ/3
[02:10:52] <Dharhix> Sadly no. Output is full string.
[02:11:49] <VectorX> Dharhix are you sure you are making the changes in the test and not running the old code ?

[02:11:57] <VectorX> might want to double check that
[02:12:37] <VectorX> try typing a wrong regex like   abc  and see if you still get the full match
[02:12:43] <Dharhix> Positive. I have the .ini file in Notepad++, save / refresh rainmeter's skin. I wish it was that though.
[02:13:27] <Dharhix> Yeah, I'm trying to find regex they used somewhere else that seems to work and make my way from there. 
[02:14:53] <VectorX> did you try abc and see if you still got the full match ?
[02:15:05] <Dharhix> They do things in a slightly convoluted way, tbh. But that's my problem. I'll twiddle with what you gave me and what I find.
[02:23:31] <Dharhix> Whoops, forgot about abc. I'm just slightly not dumb with regex, where would I use that "abc" to test?
[02:24:38] <VectorX> i gave you two regex
[02:25:05] <VectorX> 's to try, and you kept saying you keep getting the same full match, so where ever you were updating the regex try some nonsense like abc
[02:25:23] <VectorX> something that would not work, if it still ends up giving the full match, you are updating in the wrong place
[02:29:30] <Dharhix> Okay. The thing is that app uses the line where the regex is parsed in two ways. First a simple substitution going like "thing":"mod_thing", "REGEX HERE". So, I try to use "":"", "Given Regex" and other permutations, but I have no idea which part is problematic. As I said, convoluted.
[02:30:29] <Dharhix> For example, if I do something like "SMART":"", "" it would remove the SMART part.

[17:03:06] <re101-fousek-76> thanks
[17:03:11] <JohnDoe2> 0 is always the full match, and 1, 2, 3 and so on are capturing group IDs (small chunks of full match)

[18:29:03] <zohoor> this one is saved 
[18:29:48] <Lope> Not sure how to allow the crap with commas to repeat as many times as the user wants
[18:30:25] <Lope> Another idea: https://regex101.com/r/oF0xah/2
[18:31:55] <purplex> zohoor: what do you want with SS-15?
[18:32:05] <JohnDoe2> Lope you need to follow a specific address format if you're doing validation. If you let people add as much crap with commas as you want you're bound to get false positive
[18:32:09] <JohnDoe2> positives*
[18:32:22] <Lope> JohnDoe2, I want it to be loose
[18:32:31] <Lope> just want to prevent people doing totally dumb shit.
[18:32:41] <Lope> I'm not trying to make it ultra secure.
[18:32:48] <Lope> Just idiot-harden it a bit.
[18:33:08] <JohnDoe2> well that doesn't diminish my point at all
[18:33:23] <JohnDoe2> how can you tell which one is the street number vs other shit vs city name/
[18:33:32] <Lope> I can't
[18:33:39] <Lope> it's not meant to be machine readable at all.
[18:33:42] <JohnDoe2> they all are separated by commas, are words, and will be before some state and a zip code :)
[18:33:43] <Lope> it's just for reference
[18:33:51] <zohoor> I have a list of different words that starts with SS or BB.. they are in various locations of texts. I need to go to each row that contains the description of that product and extract any letters starts with SS or BB 
[18:33:55] <JohnDoe2> so what's the totally dumb shit you're trying to avoid, then Lope?
[18:34:14] <Lope> okay you made me realize I should split it then validate the parts
[18:34:28] <Lope> JohnDoe2, I don't know exactly. Users do weird shit
[18:34:37] <Lope> like fill in their phone number in an address field, or something.
[18:34:45] <Lope> or like their web address in the physical address field.
[18:34:50] <Lope> I dunno.
[18:35:07] <Lope> It's okay, nevermind. I'll validate the parts separately.
[18:35:24] <JohnDoe2> Lope right, so if you get "Foo Park" as a chunk, what is that?
[18:35:42] <Lope> it's [\w ]
[18:36:03] <Lope> it's not www.foo.com
[18:36:16] <JohnDoe2> no, I mean is it a weird user shit? a city? a unit name? a building name? a state?
[18:36:36] <Lope> It doesn't really matter
[18:36:56] <JohnDoe2> then you're probably better off disallowing characters that should not make up an address
[18:37:07] <Lope> as long as they give me at least 2 [\w '-]+ with a comma inbetween, I'm happy.
[18:37:10] <purplex> zohoor: https://regex101.com/r/6dfOmA/2 ?
[18:38:36] <zohoor> how can I use the code in python?
[18:38:38] <JohnDoe2> Lope sounds like fun :) then yes, what you did in one of them versions is fine (?:repeatable chunk)+
[18:39:00] <zohoor> it looks good. marks whatever starts with SS and BB
