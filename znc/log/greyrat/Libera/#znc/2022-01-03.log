[17:00:56] <antranigv> What IRC client do you folks use on Android?
[17:14:38] <jiggawatt> irccloud
[17:14:57] <jiggawatt> works great with znc
[17:15:16] <BtbN> You you put a bouncer behind a bouncer?
[17:15:23] <jiggawatt> irccloud isn't a bouncer
[17:15:37] <jiggawatt> it's a web based IRC client hosted on a server
[17:16:05] <BtbN> They literally advertise with bouncer-features on their website
[17:16:13] <jiggawatt> yes, it has bouncer features
[17:16:21] <jiggawatt> I don't use those though
[17:16:23] <BtbN> The name even implies them
[17:16:32] <jiggawatt> no it doesn't
[17:16:38] <BtbN> It's an IRC client running on their servers
[17:16:41] <jiggawatt> yes
[17:16:42] <BtbN> Just like ZNC
[17:16:48] <jiggawatt> znc isn't an IRC client
[17:17:09] <BtbN> It very much is. How do you think it connects to various IRC networks?
[17:17:33] <Khaytsus> znc is an irc client and an irc server ;)
[17:17:43] <Khaytsus> A specialized one, of course.
[17:17:49] <jiggawatt> it's not really a client in the non-technical usage of the word
[17:18:01] <Khaytsus> I personally just use weechat's relay client most of the time on Android
[17:18:23] <BtbN> So using their cloud-based bouncer to connect to your ZNC instance is super weird and redundant
[17:18:31] <jiggawatt> not at all BtbN 
[17:18:36] <BtbN> Yes, yes it is.
[17:18:37] <Khaytsus> In computing,[1] a client is a piece of computer hardware or software that accesses a service made available by a server as part of the client–server model of computer networks
[17:18:41] <jiggawatt> IRCCloud delivers IRC to your phone better than any other solution
[17:18:45] <Khaytsus> So jiggawatt you can redfine it all _you_ want, it is a client.
[17:18:55] <jiggawatt> no Khaytsus 
[17:18:55] <BtbN> But why have ZNC in the mix then to begin with?
[17:19:01] <jiggawatt> that's a technical CS definition of client
[17:19:06] <Khaytsus> Oh lord
[17:19:07] <jiggawatt> for a fancy hostname BtbN 
[17:19:17] <BtbN> Have you heard of cloaks?
[17:19:18] <jiggawatt> BtbN: /whois jiggawatt 
[17:19:19] <Khaytsus> znc doesn't give you a "fancy hostname"
[17:19:32] <jiggawatt> the instance it is running on can
[17:19:42] <Khaytsus> that's true of anything
[17:19:44] <jiggawatt> BtbN: /whois jiggawatt 
[17:19:58] <Khaytsus> And that's a dumb hostname
[17:20:01] <Khaytsus> Anywho
[17:20:03] * Khaytsus &
[17:20:13] <jiggawatt> well you are a dummy Khaytsus 
[17:20:20] <jiggawatt> I have $$ to blow
[17:20:36] <jiggawatt> because I earn 8x times the average salary where I live
[17:20:54] <jiggawatt> actually 9x
[17:21:00] <Khaytsus> Let's move on....
[17:21:14] <jiggawatt> I bet you are poor and unemployed Khaytsus 
[17:21:23] <Khaytsus> Last warning.  Move on.

[21:47:45] <MetaNova> <antranigv> What IRC client do you folks use on Android?
[21:48:03] <MetaNova> antranigv: the still #1 recommended client is Revolution
[21:48:23] <MetaNova> as far as I know. you can ask the #android people what they recommend for Android IRC clients
[21:48:45] <MetaNova> (Revolution was their primary suggestion as of a while ago, it may have changed, but I doubt it)
[21:49:18] <MetaNova> the others I have often heard were AndroIRC and Yaaic

[22:57:21] <Khaytsus> Yeah, native ANdroid standalone client, Revolution is the one I prefer..  I suppose that's the more direct answer than me preferring weechat relay ;)
[22:57:53] <MetaNova> I mean, from a mobile perspective, there are lots of options, some of them not "native" like The Lounge or weechat relay

[23:22:16] <beastDivision> I've got an issue that whenever I try to edit a user or network when znc is behind a reverse proxy, like nginx, it will say "no such user", but if I bypass the reverse proxy, and go directly to the znc instance with the portnumber, then I am able to edit the users / networks on the web admin module 
[23:22:46] <Nacorid> Sounds like your proxy setup is wrong
[23:23:11] <beastDivision> what setting should I be looking for in the nginx config, because I followed it exactly as on the wiki 
[23:24:32] <Nacorid> My nginx set up includes these two lines in location /
[23:24:35] <Nacorid> proxy_pass https://[::1]:1027/;
