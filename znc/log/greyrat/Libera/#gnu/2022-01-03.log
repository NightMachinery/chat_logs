[08:01:51] <labrador> pidgin is a nice client
[08:02:04] <labrador> Though its usage has been supplanted by matrix bridges
[08:02:17] <libredev> 7,99labrador99,99: yes
[08:02:34] <labrador> Now communities can be on different clients,servers,protocols. You can use anything an still communicate
[08:02:47] <libredev> Matrix killed everything.
[08:04:25] <labrador> lmao yeah I remember you hate matrix
[08:04:37] <libredev> lol
[08:04:52] <libredev> I only like irc
[08:06:06] <labrador> I like both
[08:06:13] <labrador> But hate telegram and sicord
[08:06:23] <libredev> My idea is we should use different protocol for different things.
[08:06:43] <libredev> This make things simple and fast
[08:06:51] <labrador> Yes indeed,and the utility of matrix diminishes when you use it as a public text forum
[08:07:02] <labrador> No need of encryption,or videos and audio
[08:07:09] <labrador> So why not use irc
[08:07:13] <libredev> Yes
[08:07:15] <labrador> Its faster and lighter
[08:07:37] <libredev> For audio, u have mumble
[08:08:02] <libredev> For video conferencing, u have webrtc
[08:08:49] <libredev> Don't just make a complicated protocol to do all things from one client.
[08:08:56] <labrador> Yeah but technically matrix also uses jitsi for audio and video
[08:08:59] <labrador> So evens out
[08:09:09] <labrador> Technically element is a multiprotocol client
[08:09:37] <libredev> Ya but is stupid.
[08:09:47] <labrador> lmao
[08:10:11] <libredev> Because one client can't do each protocol perfectly
[08:10:26] <labrador> Why? look at pidgin
[08:10:34] <labrador> It does every protocol well
[08:10:40] <labrador> Okay maybe not
[08:11:16] <labrador> I understand,a dedicated client will always be better.
[08:11:30] <labrador> its just that nobody want 100+ comm applications on their computers
[08:11:43] <labrador> Because nobody can agree on a nice comm solution

[08:32:46] <epony> is it free?
[08:33:27] <epony> hint: if it runs in a web browser, it's not free (it's captive of the browser VM and UI)
[08:33:27] <labrador> epony, yes

[08:37:05] <labrador> There are normal clients too
[08:37:06] <libredev> 7,99labrador99,99: no it your fault, they just stack other protocol on top their protocol

[08:40:40] <labrador> Accept matrix
[08:40:48] <epony> not just again, it's the realities of "getting over" the defects of systems that control and subjugate people, while presenting themselves as "free" alternatives with a very high "exit" cost
[08:41:24] <libredev> I don't why today's people like everything in one app i.e. browser, but in early computing, everything was simple and people liked simplicity.
[08:41:50] <epony> labrador, I have lived most of my time in unlicensed territory and it really did not matter then, does not matter now ;-) nothing that dramatic
[08:42:50] <epony> independent programs that are not captive in one "protocol" carrier sub-set are superior by design
[08:43:00] <epony> HTTP is not that good of a protocol anyway
[08:43:16] <epony> neither are XML very useful for data serialisation
[08:43:20] <epony> etc etc

[08:45:23] <labrador> libredev, epony is a gone case,but is there anything that can convince you of matrix and xmpps worthiness?
[08:45:40] <epony> the main problems are data and comms carrier protocols and poor reference implementation languages and design choices
[08:45:45] <libredev> 11,99epony99,99: yes it is simpler than matrix
[08:45:59] <epony> xmpp is actually almost free and open

[08:50:29] <gothicserpent> only keeping it around cuz some of my peeps use it. peer pressure :X
[08:51:14] <libredev> are*
[08:51:24] <epony> that's a direct "reject", but sometimes even seemingly "free" ones are "weak freedoms" with "defective by design" choices for "platformisation" and "commecialisation" on top of a free code model of some web-dingy
[08:51:30] <libredev> Sorry i have to go.

[09:11:00] <labrador> thats decentralization
[09:11:03] <labrador> youre confused
[09:11:17] <libredev> what u mean
[09:11:19] <labrador> Matrix and xmpp are decentralized AND federated
[09:11:30] <labrador> Federation is that if I'm on X server
[09:11:35] *** Quits: Nios34 (~Nios34@106.118.18.188) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[09:11:35] <labrador> you're on Y server
[09:11:42] <labrador> We can still communicate
[09:11:47] <epony> matrix is an HTTP "payload"
[09:11:51] <labrador> The servers will manage it
[09:12:00] *** Joins: Nios34 (~Nios34@106.118.18.188)
[09:12:13] <labrador> That is a very useful feature in rivaling centralization while giving the same experience
[09:12:17] *** Joins: jxself (~jxself@gnu/chief-webmaster/jxself)
[09:12:33] <labrador> Otherwise decentralization will always be an inferior experience
[09:12:44] <labrador> Like on irc,some are on oftc,some libera etc
[09:12:46] <epony> it's identity server "controlled" so is again centralised
[09:12:59] <labrador> With federation both can talk with each other
[09:13:06] <epony> that's relaying
[09:13:10] <labrador> But irc is not federated
[09:13:11] <epony> which email has since the 90ies
[09:13:17] <labrador> Its just decentralized
[09:13:30] <epony> the word federation makes no sense, it's for replicating central (syndicated) content
[09:13:39] <labrador> There are other protocols that decentralize and federate too
[09:13:40] <epony> federation is centralisation
[09:13:52] <labrador> Like activity pub and fediverse
[09:13:59] <labrador> Look it up sometime libredev 
[09:14:04] <epony> those are "social" networks
[09:14:28] <epony> most of which are just "some service" on top of a protocol, not protocols themselves
[09:14:41] <epony> and services as you know are the least free model
[09:14:59] <epony> as shown by 'social network services'
[09:15:23] <labrador> epony the experience of centralized content is better than decentralized ones as there is more content than just whats on your server.
[09:15:29] <epony> the reality is in protocols that are independent, stacking of protocols is just an "application" and "payload"
[09:15:30] <herd> matrix is stupid mobile stuff
[09:15:31] <labrador> Federation equals them
[09:15:44] <herd> matrix isnt free i think
[09:15:48] <labrador> While still expressing the advantages of decentralization
[09:16:04] <labrador> epony, ....activitypub is the protocol
[09:16:05] <epony> confirmed, mobile stuff is web services
[09:16:07] <labrador> Read first
[09:16:27] <epony> well, let's convince you now..
[09:16:31] <epony> so you learn too
[09:17:36] <libredev> 7,99labrador99,99: sorry is that what u mean by federation.
[09:17:41] <epony> see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(communication_protocol)#Protocol and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_instant_messaging_protocols
[09:17:52] <libredev> So we don't need federation
[09:18:06] <labrador> We do
[09:18:23] <epony> see, "there is no standardisation" of matrix, so some web site matrix.org run by WHO? is controlling the "alleged free" protocol
[09:18:25] <labrador> We need to rival the experience of better centralized proprietary services
[09:18:38] <labrador> Therefore we need federation
[09:18:43] <herd> yes, we dont need the federation
[09:19:13] <epony> it's just an HTPP/WebRTC payload web service with open "spec" that is also a "to be business" at some point
[09:19:23] <epony> "HTTP"
[09:21:25] <labrador> herd, you do understand screaming at people to use inferior services just because they are free does not ever go well
[09:21:30] <epony> no standards, no nothing ;-) "browser-to-browser" applications
[09:21:42] <labrador> Federation imrpoves the quality of our services
[09:21:46] <labrador> leading people to use them
[09:21:53] <epony> labrador, it's false marketing
[09:21:58] <labrador> That is why mastodon has 1 million+ users
[09:22:34] <labrador> epony, the matrix protocol is controlled by the matrix foundation
[09:22:37] <epony> the HTTPisation is just pathetic attempt to reimplement everything in-browser, poorly
[09:23:00] <labrador> You can send them RFCs if you want to see some change
[09:23:03] <herd> federation sucks, we dont need that
[09:23:06] <labrador> Maybe they accept it
[09:23:17] <labrador> herd, WHY. WHY DO YOU THINK IT SUCKS
[09:23:25] <epony> where you can have independent application protocols, you're advertising HTTP-carrier services for cellular browsers ran 'applications'
[09:23:35] <epony> that you happen to call protocols, while they are, web services
[09:23:45] <epony> cause it's false
[09:23:55] <herd> i just think it
[09:24:42] <labrador> epony, a lot of protocols converse over https because its easier than making it from scratch. And matrix does not need to be used from cellular browsers.
[09:24:44] <epony> the moment you have everything behind the ISP HTTP gateway, you're just.. not having real applications and no real internet, you have only HTTP service
[09:24:50] <epony> no it's not
[09:24:55] <labrador> yes it is
[09:24:58] <epony> it's browser targeting

[12:08:09] <epony> cause people on mobile phones from matrix bridges are annoying ;-)
[12:08:37] <labrador> i'm not from matrix
[12:08:44] <labrador> but i get your point
[12:09:16] <epony> it's just distracting from the real discussion typically on some argumentation..
[12:10:00] <libredev> epony: but sometimes it is better to use PM.
[12:10:12] <belgin> epony: the linux patch set is still work in progress, apparently
[12:10:13] <epony> which is better formulated with thought and attention to detail in public etc, a tradition from mailing lists, to not partake in one on one depriving the list of the benefits
[12:10:28] <epony> belgin, what kind of problems does it address?
[12:10:53] <epony> (or what approach does it use to achieve that, conditional disable with ifdefs?)
[12:10:55] <belgin> mainly c header dependency issues, and it has a side effect of making the kernel build faster
[12:11:47] <epony> yeah, it's probably going to be a problem, unless you used the same "compiler" and modifications as the person/team authoring these, cause.. it's supposed to be very specific and "minimally required" but also vital inclusionss
[12:12:33] <epony> headers list common functions and defined variables and blocks of reusable code, it's likely over time some are not needed.. but can't be applied with a wide brush etc
[12:12:47] <belgin> the cover letter for the patch set talks about a specific defconfig, but i don't know where it is. that's probably the issue
[12:13:10] <epony> probably it's related to the "kernel configuraion" of what to compile
[12:13:49] <epony> tweaking that has been a long running project of individuals and user groups for "kern conf" tunes
[12:14:47] <epony> from the early days of the commercial internet about 1995 and later, since machines then were much more constrained and Linux GUI ran sluggish on machines in the 1996-2000 term
[12:15:25] <epony> so people tried to trim their kernels and such, but the fault is shared objects / libraries and desktop environments (as always)
[12:15:43] <epony> and some "key performance" regions of the syscalls etc
[12:16:06] <epony> at any rate, such tasks are worthwhile learning the OS internals (kernel to userspace integration)
[12:18:25] <epony> you'd think the reasonable idea would be to have "kernel conf" sets and included various "size" and "tuning profile" kernel configuration and makefile sets.. for the last 25 years ;-) have to check it out, can't believe 1 single kernel size fits all machines
[12:18:40] <epony> that's a common problem with many (all?) operating systems
[12:19:54] <epony> "lots of menu traversals" is not the way to achieve enlightenment, but it sure installs routine with which people get used and not resolve the challenge at their path
[12:21:02] <labrador> i could not understand anything of what you said
[12:21:44] <epony> applies to other classes of programs too, like editors, integrated environments, office and graphics suites, browsers and othe heavy (monster) applications like databases and web servers with stacks upon stacks

[12:28:11] <labrador> what music player you use?
[12:29:38] <epony> cmus
[12:30:21] <epony> it's pretty light and portable.. and I use an audio server in the LAN, which is a netbook, which has good quality HD audio interface and amplification
[12:30:49] <epony> so other machines stream audio and play it like that, without tricks like "queue" management on a media player daemon
[12:31:41] <epony> tried winamp in the 90ies but it was replaced with xmms etc.. and then got into the "on demand" play only and consequently console / screen interfaces cause they are lighter and predictable
[12:31:52] <labrador> what do you think about ncmpcpp?
[12:31:56] <epony> but GUI programs are what I use for "interactive and data intensive" tasks
[12:32:05] <epony> it's probably good ;-)

[12:33:02] <labrador> lmao
[12:33:03] <epony> or something
[12:33:38] <labrador> right now tho i use deadbeef
[12:34:06] <labrador> its pretty light too
[12:34:12] <labrador> only 16mb
[12:34:16] <labrador> ram
[12:34:46] <epony> I don't like split front and backends for download/sharing file managers and media players, makes me concerned about quality and security

[12:35:29] <epony> the role of the "multiplexors" is to make sure it happens
[12:35:40] <labrador> but that low compared to rythmbox
[12:35:50] <epony> like you have a built-in switch in your broadband modem
[12:36:02] <epony> or like you have a built-in switch in your receiver / amplifier
[12:36:09] <epony> you can have a separate one

[12:37:38] <epony> so, in the result of the media player front end.. you separate in client and server but the application, instead of the audio transport / mixer
[12:38:09] *** Joins: apteryx (~maxim@dsl-152-60.b2b2c.ca)
[12:38:34] <epony> libredev, yes, I use OpenBSD on interactive machines and FreeBSD in server / production roles, and Linux as a fallback, but I also use parts of GNU utils and applications to
[12:39:09] <epony> so, the carrier of the "computing" is preferred to be a more conservative UNIX-descendant kernel
[12:39:33] <epony> but of course, would use Linux if my particular hardware could not run BSD
[12:39:46] <libredev> FreeBSD on server, why not OpenBSD
[12:40:17] <epony> well, technically you can, but the applications make choices instead of you sometimes, and most of the times they force you to use Linux
[12:41:04] <epony> especially in performance and concurrence with FreeBSD trailing Linux closely (or taking advantage on process intensive workloads)
[12:41:28] <libredev> Ooh i see
[12:41:31] <epony> OpenBSD has advantages on internet facing and application development and personal and interactive machines
[12:41:54] <epony> Linux has advantages of running applications that do not know about BSD etc
[12:42:53] <libredev> oh u are right
[12:43:02] <libredev> Nice
[12:43:45] <epony> so the point was, to try to get the benefits of multiplexing where you can, at least on networking services like remote sessions and possibly audio and video
[12:44:29] <epony> and running the tasks directly on the machines you need them, either via textual remote sessions or with X forwarding (for rare cases you can't find appropriate applications about it)
[12:45:53] <epony> hence the choice of media player that uses local storage and sends processed audio (~200-250KB/s) over the network, and mix automatically on the audio server
[12:46:18] <libredev> Great
[12:46:24] <epony> instead of runing a media player remotely on the amplified machine, and controlling its queue from several locations
[12:46:37] *** Quits: chuangzhu (~chuangzhu@user/chuangzhu) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[12:47:11] <epony> that is more functional as you can run several audio "players" or clients and get them all going throught the respecive speakers
[12:47:53] <epony> especially useful if you track many "media" at the same time and toggle them for direct view

[12:56:06] <epony> so OpenSSH comes from developers from OpenBSD and lives there, so why bother with waiting for portability shims and other adaptations, instead of having it direct from the original workgroup
[12:56:17] <epony> is part of the rationale for "internal use" machines

[13:00:17] <epony> most new "application level" protocols release their "implementations" and client-server suites in bizarre new languages, targeting mostly and predominantly (and only) Linux and mobiles
[13:00:41] <epony> and that's what gets on the nerves of older generation people who call that "unfit" for work
[13:01:58] <epony> while HTTP itself being alright of an API transport, the "name your language of the year" application server for "a particular web server" is just.. horrible exclusion / unportable software design choices
[13:03:48] <epony> and that is the real explanation, why modern software targeting particularly mobile usage and as a fallback Linux, and no chance of system portability at least in the first 5-10 years of its existence, in contrast to say the same thing that is now 15-20 years old and having that portability and server-client choices in real-world programming languages, that's why they get different treatment and qualification
[13:04:05] <epony> 'the practical deployment' of it matters more than the 'promised wonderland feature sets'
[13:04:35] <epony> that's why PHP beat other languages for the year 2000 web stack

[13:48:52] <labrador> epony, I like browsers for proprietary applications
[13:49:00] <labrador> Atleast they are self contained
[13:49:08] <libredev> no
[13:49:20] <libredev> They get your personal info
[13:49:21] <labrador> Unless you use a proprietary browser in which case you're fucked
[13:49:29] <libredev> With non free JavaScript
[13:49:44] <labrador> libredev, Not if its hardened firefox
[13:49:46] <gry> rindolf: interesting. why was analysing a game annoying?
[13:50:07] <gry> rindolf: did they analyse it with a computer chess engine or by hand?
[13:50:09] <labrador> rindolf, that dnd thing you sent me a link about,is it a popular game or something?
[13:50:28] <libredev> 7,99labrador99,99: Browser is the most insecure application
[13:51:44] <labrador> no,they are conversely the most hardened applications because you visit a lot of stuff in it. But yeah make it less featureful and the hardening would be considerably easie
[13:51:48] <rindolf> gry: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flogging_a_dead_horse
[13:51:58] <labrador> There is a reason nobody makes their own browsers
[13:52:14] <labrador> Just reskins either chromium or firefox
[13:52:18] <libredev> 7,99labrador99,99: because they are bloat

[13:54:35] <rindolf> gry: by hand
[13:54:55] <labrador> It is not your OS. Its just hardened because you visit the most amount of untrusted materials with it. There is a reason you're okay with clicking a random link in your browser than installing a random application
[13:55:01] <labrador> Because browsers are armoured
[13:56:03] *** Joins: tesseract (~tesseract@user/tesseract)
[13:56:59] <libredev> 7,99labrador99,99: lol, that why browser is insecure because they have random link
[13:57:23] <epony> labrador, well, no objection to what you like / prefer, just not always the option / tooling outside windows / mobile
[13:58:09] <labrador> libredev, I feel like you did not understand what I was trying to illustrate at all
[13:58:18] <labrador> Reread it
[13:58:54] <labrador> epony, firefox works very well in gnu/linux
[13:59:04] <labrador> I couldn't care less about chromium
[13:59:37] <epony> for example I use a JS-less browser to browse the Inter"web" and Google pages require JS for most activity, hence we have to use various tricks to bypass that, but Youtube is horrible in this regards, since it stopped showing even the first page of search results (with login / JS / cookie agreement)
[14:00:13] *** Joins: Lord_of_Life_ (~Lord@user/lord-of-life/x-2819915)
[14:00:13] <epony> so Google is acting as a "large demon" requesting you to use a JS infected program so it can send payload to your browser and convert your machine to a remote botnet node
[14:00:46] <epony> while I like Firefox (Ff), it is really heavy and slow, and so is Chrome (Cr)
[14:01:14] *** Quits: Lord_of_Life (~Lord@user/lord-of-life/x-2819915) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[14:01:30] *** Lord_of_Life_ is now known as Lord_of_Life
[14:01:37] <epony> because, they go "multi-process" even on older machines and even when you tell then to be 1proces, they spawn 4 at minimum and you have only 2 cores of which you can't give no more than 50% of one of them
[14:02:01] <epony> so.. both heavy browsers are a disaster on machines of previous generation (power 2core computers from the 2008 epoch)
[14:02:24] <epony> thus, you learn to "hate" the JS-browser and live without it
[14:02:43] *** Quits: Xenguy__ (~Xenguy@user/xenguy) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)

[14:03:25] <epony> and then you download the videos with youtube-dl / -dlp and view then in a media player like mpv that have GPU accelerated output, but note, NOT decoding (sucks!)
[14:03:43] <epony> so, the word WebRTC is pure "scandal" ;-)
[14:03:49] *** Joins: vivien (~Vivien@2a00:5881:4008:2810::b39)
[14:03:58] <epony> and JS is slow and useless
[14:04:18] <epony> while browsing the web with a JS-less browser is lightning fast
[14:04:31] <epony> so the browser is a real disaster
[14:05:21] <epony> as it forces upon you "choices of hardware" as in, why would you allow Mozilla and Google and Facebook and Amazon to decide on your behalf when you should buy a new computer because the browser said so!
[14:05:49] <epony> just like that, your CPU is not supported any more, you're stuck with an old browser, and SSL moves on to new ciphers and you're out..
[14:05:56] <epony> that's called forced obsoletion
[14:06:04] <epony> so FF and CR are very much hated!
[14:06:18] <gry> rindolf: i see
[14:06:20] <epony> like the smell of evil, greed, corruption and abuse
[14:06:43] <epony> even if FF is free and "tunable" it comes with insane / wrong defaults etc
[14:07:21] <epony> and on such machine, if you run without the heavy browser (which is heavy for no good reason, because it wants to take the jobs of the OS which you already have and use efficiently)
[14:07:40] <epony> if you run without placing the applications in teh browser, EVERYTHING WORKS fast and reliably

[14:18:51] <labrador> The source is free
[14:18:55] <labrador> Go modify it
[14:18:58] <epony> the browsers are the single worst application to absolutely replace and cut into separate independent applications and completely eliminate them as a model of enforcing vulnerabilities and disasters of user data theft and exploitation
[14:19:21] <epony> KDE is heavy, I liked it until 3.5 then it became useless so I removed it
[14:19:58] <epony> it was really heavy on 1998 computers, it was passable on 2002-2004 computers, it was good on early 64bit dual core machines 2004-2008
[14:20:11] <epony> and after 2008-2010 KDE is just worthless on such computers
[14:20:25] <epony> so yes, desktop environments are not useful
[14:20:44] <epony> I just run the applications direct with a window manager and the machine flies like new
[14:20:59] <epony> no KDE and no GNOME -> everything works fast and really well
[14:21:11] <epony> no Firefox and no Chrome -> same!
[14:22:02] <epony> once you add one of these "heavy" monster programs (that are really virtual machines without acceleration and without efficient native use of the OS process control), everything becomes slow and also remote abuse susceptible
[14:22:33] <epony> because JS is a malware delivery vector, and so are web platforms like Google, Youtube, Gmail, Facebook, Twitter etc
[14:22:55] <labrador> my god its a language
[14:23:00] <epony> they are all, running code on your system, that you can not avoid and they stuff malware and abuse your browser to poke your storage
[14:23:11] <epony> it's a runtime interpreter
[14:23:11] <labrador> According to you c is a malware delivery vector
[14:23:17] <epony> that runs foreign abuse code
[14:23:18] <labrador> So python too?
[14:23:19] <epony> well no
[14:23:22] <labrador> why
[14:23:40] <epony> because I choose what programs I run, when I run them I know what they are and they run fast and clean
[14:24:00] <labrador> epony, use electron and you can also choose what programs you run
[14:24:06] <epony> the browser makes BAD choices and runs heavy and slow programs that abuse the data on the machine and the people using it lose time and information
[14:24:13] <epony> nope ;-)
[14:24:21] <labrador> Any proof of that?
[14:24:28] <labrador> Or just misinfo again
[14:24:50] <epony> the Javascript is removed, I use light fast browsers without it, and the machine runs hundreds of pages faster than you've seen a computer open a text file
[14:24:58] <epony> there is lots of proof

[14:59:14] <labrador> rindolf, I know. Its considerably harder to make microkernels with their performance worse as well
[14:59:21] <epony> yeah, and took the file system and memory management and the networking from BSD UNIX exactly by copying its designs and pasting it in own wording
[14:59:22] <GNUHacker> linux-libre and hurd
[14:59:25] <labrador> But these kernels are more stable and secure
[14:59:32] <labrador> I see that as a net positive
[14:59:42] <epony> which kernels are more secure?
[15:00:08] <epony> say, from a bunch of OS and kernel experts here, why does not GNU have a kernel and an operating system?
[15:00:23] <GNUHacker> GNU have 2 kernels
[15:00:29] <epony> yeah, it does?
[15:00:30] <GNUHacker> 2 oficial kernels
[15:00:44] <GNUHacker> also have linux generic kernel and BSD kernel, and other
[15:00:47] <epony> oh fantastic news, where were these kernels from 1990 to 2020?
[15:01:13] <epony> did they come from a bunch of non-GNU people by any chance?
[15:01:17] <GNUHacker> so GNU have 4 kernels 
[15:01:28] <GNUHacker> also have slackware i think but im not sure
[15:01:33] <epony> like the BSD group and the Linux group of developers

[15:02:19] <epony> then show me how it's done, and I'll rate your work by my criteria
[15:02:29] <labrador> Uh the number of kernels GNU can use is BSD,linux,hurd
[15:02:30] <labrador> So 3
[15:02:36] <labrador> epony, no strawmen
[15:02:42] <labrador> Microkernels are superior
[15:02:44] <GNUHacker> linux-libre is another kernel
[15:02:58] <labrador> Its just linux 
[15:03:02] <GNUHacker> linux-libre isnt linux
[15:03:06] <labrador> lmao
[15:03:08] <labrador> how?
[15:03:12] <GNUHacker> it is
[15:03:15] <epony> all the experts in this room know so much about kernels and operating systems, but argue what kernel to take, the original UNIX from BSD UNIX or the kid stuff UNIX from Linux..
[15:03:32] <epony> hurd-libre when?
[15:03:42] <epony> I need more kernels for your userland.
[15:03:44] <GNUHacker> i dont use linux in my GNU system
[15:03:54] <epony> you're the smartest of the bunch here
[15:04:08] <GNUHacker> linux have non-free blobs
[15:04:09] <epony> maybe you like Firefox even
[15:04:20] <epony> but does Firefox run on your kernel?
[15:04:49] <epony> can you play an HD stream from the Internet or from a local file?
[15:05:08] <epony> can you render me a 3D graphic in a CAD application?
[15:05:39] <epony> can you do some generic word processing or colour-separation for pre-press?
[15:06:00] <epony> what about Internet applications and can you run an email server on it?

[15:13:09] <epony> they wanted to say "we installed a shim" so that your POSIX apps will run and that we imitate UNIX ;-)
[15:13:26] <epony> Apple is not a UNIX company, period
[15:13:28] <labrador> epony windows derived from OS/2
[15:13:32] <labrador> epony it is
[15:13:37] <labrador> It uses the XNU kernel
[15:13:42] <labrador> a UNIX kernel
[15:13:45] <epony> Windows derived from DOS ;-)
[15:13:50] <labrador> Look at it on wikipedia
[15:13:59] <epony> OK
[15:14:28] <labrador> XNU is a hybrid kernel, containing features of both monolithic kernels and microkernels, attempting to make the best use of both technologies, such as the message passing ability of microkernels enabling greater modularity and larger portions of the OS to benefit from memory protection, and retaining the speed of monolithic kernels for some critical tasks. 
[15:14:31] <labrador> Thats so cool
[15:14:42] <epony> first Bill Gates bought DOS from an individual who was stealing DR-DOS from DRI inc that produced CP/M as an adaptation of UNIX to PCs
[15:14:42] <labrador> I wanna run GNU on the XNU kernel
[15:15:02] <epony> then William H. Gates was trying to be a UNIX reseller too, and failed
[15:15:24] <labrador> The BSD code present in XNU has been most recently synchronised with that from the FreeBSD kernel. Although much of it has been significantly modified, code sharing still occurs between Apple and the FreeBSD Project as of 2009
[15:15:27] <labrador> haha I win
[15:15:27] <epony> so they started peacemeal copying features primitively to get their "DOS"-creation to upsell to IBM
[15:15:32] <labrador> XNU is BSD is UNIX
[15:15:40] <epony> no, it's nothing
[15:15:45] <labrador> what
[15:15:48] <epony> you can't download or install it
[15:15:54] <labrador> dont matter 
[15:15:56] <labrador> its unix
[15:15:57] <epony> does not exist virtually or physically
[15:16:00] <labrador> Just accept it lmao
[15:16:06] <labrador> Like I gave you proof
[15:16:14] <labrador> There's no argument left
[15:16:19] <epony> it's not, it's a clone of XENIX which was an early MSFT rebranding of UNIX from AT&T
[15:16:41] <epony> don't know what even XNU is?
[15:16:53] <epony> maybe you wanted to say xenu or xanadu ;-)
[15:16:54] <labrador> The basis of the XNU kernel is a heavily modified (hybrid) Open Software Foundation Mach kernel (OSFMK) 7.3.
[15:16:58] <labrador> Thats bullshit
[15:17:06] <epony> Dude, nobody cares of "xnu"
[15:17:06] <labrador> OSFMK is a UNIX kernel
[15:17:17] <labrador> XNU is Apple's kernel lmao

[15:17:51] <labrador> thats false

[15:18:18] <labrador> Don't shift the argument
[15:18:21] <labrador> We are on XNu
[15:18:39] <labrador> macOS – operating system released by Apple, Inc., with XNU as kernel
[15:18:45] <labrador> Its the kernel of macos
[15:19:07] <epony> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft_Windows "The first versions of Windows (1.0 through to 3.11) were graphical shells that ran from MS-DOS. Windows 95, though still being based on MS-DOS, was its own operating system, using a 16-bit DOS-based kernel[citation needed] and a 32-bit user space."

[15:27:03] <labrador> lmao,did you even know what a computer was at 4?
[15:27:26] <epony> so just had early access to 6502 and 65C02 and 8086 and 80186 PCs
[15:27:32] <epony> yes
[15:27:42] <labrador> lol youre joking

[15:29:02] <labrador> cool
[15:29:10] <labrador> But now I need to go
[15:29:10] <epony> there were also large PDP (DEC) 11 and other disk controller "real" UNIX running racks and terminals at dad's work so I was playing around them
[15:30:05] <epony> but I really just played with their buttons and control switches and micro-sensor keyboards and on some VT-50 and VT-100 terminals and the thing I remember is "startrek" the text board game
[15:30:14] <epony> there was chess too ;-)
[15:30:30] <epony> and they had 8" floppies and disk packs with 2MB disks
[15:30:51] <epony> and we had teletypes and radio modems and then used the PCs as terminals
[15:30:57] <epony> things like that
[15:31:14] <epony> then IBM PCs appeared and it was end-of-the line for the 8bit PCs
[15:31:52] <epony> and some ears later the workstations replaced the large computers (which were used for functional testing of PCB production)
[15:32:18] <epony> so, 8bit and 16bit PCs were made here for export
[15:32:29] <epony> the rest is not really important ;-)

[19:16:47] <iShareFreedom> what is a permissive license?
[19:16:52] <libsys> since these programs use the functions of emacs, I'm unsure how that can be legit
[19:16:54] <iShareFreedom> you are speaking about a free software license?
[19:17:10] <libsys> yes... a permisive license is the ISC/MIT license
[19:17:20] <iShareFreedom> no i dont understend what are a permissive license
[19:17:30] <iShareFreedom> if is a free software license, is good
[19:17:50] <iShareFreedom> all software must be free as in freedom software and that need a free software license
[19:18:36] <libsys> Permissive licenses allow for sublicensing as proprietary software
[19:18:43] <iShareFreedom> no
[19:18:44] <iShareFreedom> that arent
[19:18:50] <iShareFreedom> that are a license without copyleft
[19:18:56] <libsys> indeed
[19:19:02] <iShareFreedom> all licenses without copyleft are weak licenses
[19:19:17] <iShareFreedom> like bsd 2.c
[19:19:42] <iShareFreedom> i recommend you visit: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html
[19:20:26] <libsys> I know all of that... My question is if distributing emacs packages with permissive licenses is legit... DOOM emacs, an emacs distro, usesISC and nobody seems to care 
[19:20:50] <iShareFreedom> all software must be free as in freedom software, and that need a free software license
[19:20:56] <iShareFreedom> is is a free software license, are good
[19:21:25] <iShareFreedom> if arent a free software license is a injustice
