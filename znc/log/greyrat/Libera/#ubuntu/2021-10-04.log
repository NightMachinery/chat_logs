[00:12:41] <morganu> eg  I was having issues where my Zenbook was overriding the brightness level I wanted based on the room lighting. Even though it was turned up, it would sometimes still go dark.
[00:12:41] <morganu> To fix that, uncheck “Change brightness automatically when lighting changes”.
[00:13:01] <morganu> I’m not sure why Zenbooks are shipped with such a dark display and I have no clue why the ASUS Support representative was unable to assist me. But, the good news is the brightness level of my Zenbook is now the same as my desktop and Chromebook.
[00:13:29] <coraxx> morganu: uhmm..the link you've sent seems to be about Microsoft Windows ?
[00:14:08] <morganu> coraxx, I think you might look and see if there are similar things in Ubuntu.

[00:19:20] <morganu> have you installed "ubuntu tweaks" ?  That will give you more options.

[00:20:43] <morganu> fn-f5 and turns it sown and fn-f6 tturns it up --- on an asus gaming laptop. try that?
[00:20:55] <coraxx> morganu: Ubuntu tweak wont help as (I suspect) the problem is deeper ...on kernel or kernel-module level

[02:13:42] <nisa> TortillaSandwich: that I/O error sounds suspiciosly... like either bad SATA or harddrive
[02:13:44] <NoBugButFeature> nisa, in BIOS, turn off Secure Boot.
[02:13:49] <nr0q_radio> yup I'd check that you have the latest bios, and check that your drive is identified correctly in the BIOS

[02:20:52] <nr0q_radio> NoBugButFeature it's not a UEFI issue, if it were the live USB image wouldn't be booting
[02:20:55] <NoBugButFeature> nr0q_radio, yes it is a UEFI issue. He said it boots, so that implies it isn't.
[02:21:31] <nr0q_radio> that logic makes no sense
[02:21:52] <BinarySavior> i'm trying to delete partitions on a disk, i'm getting an error, i think it's because i ran mdadm --assemble on the partition that i'm trying to delete
[02:22:01] <nisa> nr0q_radio:  It's this "I am always right" logic
[02:22:03] <NoBugButFeature> and yes it is a UEFI issue. He's trying to install Ubuntu but the installer doesn't see the partition it says there is on the disk.

[04:44:05] <webchat45> ok :)

[04:44:25] <oerheks> NoBugButFeature please troll on an other network, you are warned.
[04:44:27] <NoBugButFeature> webchat45, the reason the network icon is indicating a wired connection is because the wired connection is being used in order to connect to the internet. Thats why the icon is showing a wired connection.

[11:25:41] <Lumpio-> I have resorted to installing Google's version of Chrome instead of chromium in order to get a version that works. So far haven't seen any of the quirks that come with the snap version.
[11:26:17] <Lumpio-> Just as a warning, as if it was a final "fuck you" from Canonical, removing the chromium snap deletes your profile, but it gets saved in an obscure ZIP file in /var/lib/snapd/snapshots you can restore it from.

[12:13:10] <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1856608 in linux (Ubuntu Focal) "[Regression] usb usb2-port2: Cannot enable. Maybe the USB cable is bad?" [Undecided, Confirmed]

[12:14:23] <rxdeath> ok
[12:14:32] <rxdeath> so i remembered a few months back i got a usb cardreader deal
[12:14:42] *** Joins: panickedthumb (panickedth@ubuntu/member/panickedthumb)
[12:14:43] <rxdeath> it plugs directly into a usb header on the motherboard

[12:14:59] <rxdeath> i pulled that shit out (yes, while the computer was running, i'm crazy)  and those messages stopped
[12:15:11] <rxdeath> so i think i want to plug it into the other header and see if the message comes back
[12:15:21] <KBar> lol
[12:15:25] <rxdeath> but is it likely that port is dead, or likely the card reader is an asshole
[12:15:29] <KBar> glad you found the root cause
[12:16:10] <rxdeath> and yes, now my usbs are mounting nearly instantly
[12:16:25] *** Joins: ledeni (~ledeni@fedora/ledeni)
[12:16:26] <rxdeath> (but i'd still like to talk about how to disable write caching to all usb devices)
[12:16:32] <rxdeath> so what you think, bad card reader, or bad port?
[12:16:45] <rxdeath> and is there a way to tell without just pulling shit and see what happens
[12:17:04] *** Quits: panickedthumb_ (panickedth@ubuntu/member/panickedthumb) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[12:17:07] <KBar> i was looking at how to disable a specific port
[12:17:27] <KBar> but since you found the device thats been acting up
[12:18:08] <rxdeath> yea i just pulled the thing tyhat was plugged into the other header and moved it, and no message
[12:18:20] <rxdeath> i'm gonna plug that reader back into the other port and i bet its gonna be a dick
[12:18:35] <KBar> that, or try another reader
[12:18:45] <rxdeath> so what is causing that?  just a crappy reader?  i do want a card reader becaue i work a lot with sd and micro cards a lot and i hate looking for adapters all the time
[12:18:56] <KBar> maybe
[12:19:34] <KBar> try plugging in another reader into the same port
[12:19:43] <rxdeath> yea as expected, as soon as it was plugged into, it was bitching agin
[12:19:50] <rxdeath> so the error stays with the card reader, regardless of port
[12:20:09] <rxdeath> it does have a removable cord that one end is usba3.0 and the other is motherboard usb header
[12:20:20] <rxdeath> so  iguess i can try and get another cord and see if its less angry
[12:20:24] <rxdeath> but i bet not.
[12:20:36] <rxdeath> whats a well known good card reader that i can run off the usb header
[12:20:49] <KBar> for that, you might have to google
[12:21:01] <rxdeath> bew
[12:21:01] <KBar> im out of knowledge :D
[12:21:06] <rxdeath> hoping some had personal experience
[12:21:21] <rxdeath> google is full of 98% the dumbest questions and you have to pick the 1 right link out of 200 morons
[12:21:40] <KBar> try the same card reader on a live system if you can
[12:21:57] <KBar> maybe its just the kernel acting up
[12:22:02] <KBar> after some update
[12:22:15] <KBar> preferrably 21.10

[21:26:17] <samir> Hi Everyone.  I've got a daily cron job listed in my crontab -l.  Is there an easy way to skip today's execution but resume on a daily schedule tomorrow?
[21:26:19] <Nervensaege> samir: you can have multiple "jobs" in one cron-file, in case you want to add more jobs

[21:29:26] <samir> Nervensaege:  Apologies but I'm not sure I understand how that helps me skip today's execution without impacting future runs of my job
[21:29:30] <Nervensaege> samir: if the crontab -l command shows more than one line, each line is like an single cron-job. You add more than one by starting the new one with "@ " and then putting " */5" on the end. So it could look like "@every 5min *.pl" for your job (and ".pl" is your script file)
[21:30:40] <tomreyn> Nervensaege: but this still doesn't answer samir's question, i would think
[21:30:43] <Nervensaege> tomreyn: Ah, sry then I was not answering your question. I'm not very experienced in crontab-tricks and didn't want to mislead.
[21:32:38] <samir> I'd prefer not stopping the cron service as that would impact other jobs that are scheduled

[21:33:04] <TJ-> samir: is the 'job' a shell script or command to be called?

[21:38:09] <Nervensaege> I like how the package manager asks questions when you install new packages
[21:38:43] <tomreyn> samir: my approach was to change your current    foobar    into    [ "$(date +%Y%m%d)" -ne 20211004 ] && foobar
[21:38:59] <TJ-> Nervensaege: --get-selections lists versioned libraries, whereas debfoster --show-keepers lists only packages that are at the top of the dependency pile

[21:40:05] <Aavar> Is there a simple tool to set a static IP in ubuntu? one that does not need to edit files and so on. For example in the way that Raspberry OS or Pihole does it?

[21:40:46] <Aavar> (in terminal)
