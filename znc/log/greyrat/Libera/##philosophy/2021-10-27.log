[00:01:42] <causative> sadly the US is not headed in that direction - the rich and powerful have snowballed to the point where they cannot be stopped

[00:02:06] <causative> it's their country, we just live here
[00:02:49] <mnemon> ldlework: what do you think about communities that operate based on self-set rules that aggress on the individual freedom of the members? within a larger community that focuses on the non-aggression style freedom principle?
[00:03:47] <ldlework> mnemon: if everyone agrees to something (self-set) it isn't aggression
[00:04:06] <causative> it's always aggression because agreement is never unanimous
[00:05:07] <causative> all institutions ultimately use violence to enforce their rules against people who want to break them - this does not make institutions inherently bad, but it is a fact to acknowledge
[00:06:21] <causative> even personal property is impossible without the threat of violence
[00:07:17] <causative> violence is a part of life, we cannot make a moral code based around "no violence" because violence is both everpresent and necessary for a functioning society
[00:08:11] <causative> anarchists who try to say "no violence" always try to redefine certain acts of maiming or killing to be "not violence" to make the concept work
[00:08:58] <causative> any legal system does something similar, by permitting certain acts of violence by law enforcement and others

[00:10:16] <causative> ownership of property is a social construct, not something essential in the state of nature. It is a social construct that depends essentially on violent force. As a society we define what rules we want ownership to follow - rules that may or may not include taxation, for example - and then use violence or the threat of violence to enforce the rules.

[00:15:38] <mnemon> causative: it can also be maintained mostly by common agreement with minimal violence
[00:16:14] <causative> yes, it is *mostly* common agreement, but without the violence it cannot work, because people will break the rules for personal gain if they are not stopped
[00:17:27] <causative> some people will, if not most
[00:18:16] <causative> and if some people are allowed to profit by breaking the rules without consequences, others will see this and decide there's no point in them following the rules either
[00:19:10] <causative> a law not enforced is in effect not a law
[00:20:58] <mnemon> sure, but in practice usually the main question of how much force or how many restriction do you want to employ to reduce these incidents to tolerable levels
[00:22:32] <mnemon> possibilities range from "off with their heads/hands" for any infringement to mild censure :P
[00:22:48] <causative> yes
[00:23:20] <causative> I say order requires violence but I do not say it with a negative attitude
[00:23:22] <mnemon> plus all the effects any pre-emptive and preparative measures incur
[00:23:28] <causative> it doesn't necessarily require a lot of violence

[00:26:19] <causative> what I am saying is, drawing a hard line on "no violence in my society!" cannot possibly work. There's always violence, even if it seems justified to you (e.g. punching someone who is trying to steal a sandwich that you are about to eat).
[00:27:20] <causative> what makes it "your" sandwich? only the violence, or the threat of violence, if someone else tries to take it
[00:27:39] <mnemon> mostly the commonly agreed upon rules usually
[00:27:51] <causative> rules which are enforced

[00:28:43] <mnemon> usually by lesser means than punching any would be sammich thieves

[00:33:18] <causative> I'd take that over even one day in prison.  My point is, locking someone up for months to years is a really severe and usually disproportionate response.
[00:34:30] <mnemon> might be bit of an artifact from the times when skipping town basically meant you got away with most crimes
[00:35:45] <causative> it's because the people want blood, they want someone to feel better than, they want to show their strength by crushing the weak
[00:35:57] <causative> and they like politicians who promise those things
[00:36:23] <causative> sentencing has gotten harsher in recent times
[00:36:30] <causative> if it was an artifact from an earlier time, you would expect the opposite
[00:42:27] <mnemon> not necessarily, lots of other factors affect it too
[00:43:02] <mnemon> not sure if you can consider stuff like habitual offender laws making it harsher overall for an example
[00:43:14] <mnemon> even though they do increase the incarceration times
[00:43:34] <causative> of course, in the US those laws are the result of tough-on-crime campaigning in the 90s

[14:20:15] <mannequin> oops, d/c
[14:21:06] <CaCode> just saying aliens would probably be more interested in Uranus long before they cared about saturn
[14:21:37] <mannequin> Saturn seem much more expensive
[14:22:17] <mannequin> rare fuel materials
[14:22:51] <CaCode> judging from all the alien abduction reports, they strike me as the types that would be more interested in Uranus
[14:23:12] <mannequin> now what we gonna do
[14:24:25] <CaCode> Aliens would not steal Saturn
[14:24:42] <CaCode> if they had the means to get here they would have all the resources they want

[14:24:59] <CaCode> I also doubt they would get here unless by some coincidence
[14:25:37] <CaCode> exactly it's a big universe, and if you can bridge the gap between star systems you have access to all the materials you need or ever want
[14:26:07] <mannequin> i think they probed it hard and decided to steal it

[14:45:58] <CaCode> mannequin, I doubt aliens capeable of bridging the gap between star-systems will lack anything that they can find here
[14:46:03] <CaCode> if they can travel these types of distances they could easily get any resource close to theri home
[14:46:05] <mannequin> because if jupiter hits the asteroid belt, it will ignite
[14:46:28] <mannequin> buddy, those planets are fortune, for us
[14:47:12] <CaCode> planets like that are probably existent in most star-systems
[14:47:34] <mannequin> you know, for some species, space travel is an investment
[14:47:35] <CaCode> just assume that our star-system is not unique or special in any way
[14:47:42] <mannequin> not everyone does it like "zap"
[14:47:58] <mannequin> and this is a motherfucker like this we're dealing with
[14:48:06] <CaCode> if it is an investment the cost to steal saturn would massively outweight the benefit
[14:48:17] <CaCode> the energy needed to move a planet.. let alone reach it
[14:49:08] <Digit> indeed, CaCode, the technologies for traversing casually between star systems is close proximity adjacent to e.g. energe-matter transfer technologies, and free energy technologies.  next level abundance, above the natural abundance... far far removed from the natural scarcities, let alone the manufactured scarcities.   here's hoping they've solved social problems that manufacture scarcities.  "no, you cant use the technology, you have
[14:49:08] <Digit> to rob other star systems"  lol
[14:50:17] <CaCode> it's an infinite universe with infinite planets and star-systems like ours, they wouldn't have to get here to get anyting they wanted
[14:50:40] <CaCode> they can just get any resource they wish for by traversing the universe

[14:52:46] <Digit> n_n as i was earlier just watching in st:ds9, and relating it to such tech... ""lower the inertial mass""... then moving things takes trivial (almost no) energy/effort.   could move a planet.   but again, why would you.  there'd be no motivation.  and very likely, great wisdom to know otherwise, generally.  maybe some exceptions where it is wise to move a planet?    ... but to rob a solar system of a planet out of greed?  lol!
[14:52:46] <Digit> farcical.
[14:53:00] <CaCode> this case is what we know no of physics, maybe we are wrong about that, but so far it looks like basically every planet with intellgient life is like a small isolated prison
[14:55:14] <Digit> infinite... seems too many.  ;)    but indeed, worth playing around with the drake equation frequently, as new data comes.   ... we are now in the era of detecing planets in other galaxies... (maybe... inconclusive on that first one for another 70 years... but there will be others...).
[14:55:14] <CaCode> I mean people in the sahara desert are not stealing sand
[14:55:27] <Digit> good analogy.  :)
[14:56:15] <CaCode> people who say the universe is not infinitely large, what do you expect at the end of the universe that you propose? is there a brick wall?
[14:56:27] <CaCode> what's behind that brick wall?

[16:27:09] <mannequin> no, i'm male
[16:27:41] <mannequin> are you taken?
[16:27:58] <urishgirl> No.
[16:28:18] <mannequin> so you have a chance to be the most loved person on the planet
[16:28:42] <urishgirl> Maybe.
[16:28:44] <urishgirl> :D
[16:29:17] <mannequin> that's better than no chance

[16:30:31] <mannequin> i'm also a sarmate
[16:30:50] <mannequin> so i'm bit worried about race mixing

[17:09:34] <mannequin> well, buddy, i'm looking for an uterus
[17:09:41] <mannequin> and armenians are a very good race
[17:09:47] <Ungwelian> That means that you're looking for an object.
[17:09:54] <Ungwelian> And few women want to be treated as objects.
[17:09:59] <mannequin> no, i treat humans as humans
[17:10:08] <Ungwelian> You're specifically looking for an uterus.
[17:10:24] <mannequin> well, how else you'll get kids like
[17:10:55] <Ungwelian> That's another thing. Few women want to be incubators.
[17:11:15] <mannequin> i love women for them being human and i love them for having an uterus

[17:18:27] <pussipupu> You might be speaking to closed ears there
[17:18:43] <CaCode> your alphabet comes from an african tribe called the ancient phonecians who lived in the north of african, and guess what they were black just like your recent ancestors

[17:27:28] <evolv> there aren't races of animals
[17:27:55] <pussipupu> Hooded crows and carrion crows are genetically identical except for the genes involved in the hood colouration and resist interbreeding, weirdly
[17:27:55] <CaCode> Ungwelian lean about genetics and about biology and you will learn race is a pseudo-science that was invented by idiots to make themselves feel better about themselvs
[17:28:17] <CaCode> delusional belief that runs counter to the facts
[17:28:23] <Ungwelian> Maybe we should talk about species then.

[17:29:40] <CaCode> Ungwelian, humans arent breeds of dogs
[17:29:41] <evolv> species is an arbitrary category, and subspecies even more arbitrary
[17:29:55] <Ungwelian> Seems like you have a beef with taxonomy :)
[17:30:01] <evolv> we have no single definition of species
[17:30:30] <Ungwelian> Take it up with David Attenborough. Maybe this is enough of this.
[17:30:39] <CaCode> Ungwelian, seems like you are invested in your ignorance because you derive your self-worth from a defunct pseudosceintific believe that you are somehow different from others depending on 3 out of 3billion base pairs
[17:31:00] <pussipupu> Ring species are an interesting example of the fuzziness
[17:31:05] <Ungwelian> You're the first who's bringing up any kind of self-worth :D

[17:31:54] <evolv> is Ungwelian who I think he is?
[17:32:04] <CaCode> evolv i think so
[17:32:11] <pussipupu> Where populations A and B can interbreed, populations B and C can interbreed but populations A and C can't
[17:32:19] <evolv> hmm, ident doesn't say "mahmoud"

[17:33:51] <evolv> Ungwelian was probably trolling you, CaCode
[17:33:55] <arryana> haha.  i didn't mean you, and you know it.
[17:33:56] <CaCode> they only believe in races because it tells them they are somehow better than people who look different from them
[17:34:00] <CaCode> motivated reasoning at its best
[17:34:23] <Ungwelian> CaCode, you're making a pretty sweeping generalization there.
[17:34:38] <CaCode> arryana nipping this dangerous ideology in the bud is important
[17:34:58] <arryana> argue stupidity if you feel the need, but don't tell me it's necessary.
[17:34:59] <CaCode> we saw where it ends up if it goes unchecked
[17:35:19] <CaCode> germany world war 2 and many other places people looked the other way
[17:35:22] <arryana> yeah.  there's not a single irc troll whose opinion counts for shit in the real world.  work yourself up about it if you think you have to.
[17:35:34] <CaCode> yeah racism is just trolling, right...
[17:35:47] <CaCode> nobody believes these things, right... certainly...
[17:35:54] <evolv> I'd argue none of our opinions count for shit in the real world
[17:36:03] <Ungwelian> The far right, especially, uses races nowadays to put others down.
[17:36:16] <Ungwelian> And promote themselves.
[17:36:17] <evolv> I'd also argue that IRC is just as much the real world as anywhere else
[17:37:07] <Ungwelian> I think a big problem nowadays is making really fast judgements about people based on few sentences.
[17:37:12] <Ungwelian> Happens in social media all the time.
[17:37:19] <CaCode> arryana, yeah right you probably are one of those folks who tell bullying victims to just ignore it...
[17:37:27] * arryana sets /ignore
[17:37:34] <evolv> I think my media is asocial
[17:37:38] <evolv> I talk to it, but it don't talk to me
[17:37:42] <Ungwelian> :)
[17:37:51] <CaCode> I spoke up
[17:38:12] <Ungwelian> Cyberbullying is another thing. And social justice is really often used as a tool for cyberbullying.
[17:38:12] <CaCode> another View was heard, dismantling that dangerous rethoric
[17:38:36] <evolv> ever hear of the backfire effect, CaCode?
[17:38:54] <evolv> if anything, you probably make things worse by your mode of challenging erroneous beliefs
[17:39:19] <CaCode> right rolling over really works...
[17:39:32] <CaCode> evolv you are delusional if you believe that
[17:39:38] <evolv> sometimes we're just in a lose-lose situation
[17:40:12] <CaCode> they spew racism, I speak up against it, and you take issue with that? guess what...
[17:40:18] <evolv> I'm delusional for believing in the evidenced-based position that there is a backfire effect?
[17:40:36] <evolv> just do a literature search on google scholar
[17:40:46] <CaCode> if you believe the nazis would have been defeated by just rolling over you are a ...
[17:41:00] <evolv> oh, I don't support violence
[17:41:12] <CaCode> either way I said my piece not sure what exactly you object to
[17:41:20] * Ungwelian wonders how to taxonomically define herself
[17:41:35] <evolv> Ungwelian, as not-self
[17:41:43] <Ungwelian> Homo sapiens scandinavicus spp. Fenni ?
[17:41:45] <evolv> all fabrications are not-self
[17:42:20] <Ungwelian> Some small groups here have increased prevalence of a rare disease called "Salla disease".
[17:42:31] <Ungwelian> Doesn't much exist outside Finland.
[17:43:36] <Ungwelian> I'm sure evolv agrees that genetic medicine can be really important for things like that.
[17:44:29] <mnemon> Ungwelian: I'm under the impression that "salla disease" was mostly an issue due to inbreeding ?
[17:44:38] * Ungwelian shrugs
[17:44:45] <Ungwelian> I'm not that familiar with it.
[17:45:01] <Ungwelian> In small areas with significant intermarrying, possibly.
[17:45:20] <mnemon> yeah, like salla ;P
[17:45:25] <Ungwelian> Indeed :D
[17:45:36] <evolv> Ungwelian, genetic medicine is mostly garbage
[17:46:06] <evolv> I had consulted a number of pubs a few years back, including, then, the most recent review pubs

[17:49:46] *** Joins: choozy (~choozy@75-63-174-82.ftth.glasoperator.nl)
[17:50:35] <Ungwelian> Nor a multitude of other genetic diseases. Like that thing that killed uhm, what was the name of that popular cosmologist again?
[17:51:09] <Ungwelian> IIRR, he had ALS.
[17:51:26] <mnemon> evolv: does research on hereditary diseases fall under "genetic medicine" ?
[17:51:34] <evolv> mnemon, no
[17:51:54] <Ungwelian> Hawking.
[17:52:33] <evolv> "genetic medicine," to me, means differential medical treatment for population-based genetic disorders
[17:53:55] <evolv> it could also imply genetic engineering
[17:54:07] <mnemon> you mean it's garbage because of the state of the research? or due to some fundamental flaw?
[17:54:27] <evolv> could be both
[17:54:59] <mnemon> treatment of hereditary disease seems to be an obvious case where it "works"
[17:55:14] <evolv> I was speaking of race-based medicine
[17:55:37] <evolv> but there really isn't "genetic medicine" outside of that context
[17:56:25] *** Quits: Atque (~Atque@user/atque) (Quit: ...)
[17:56:45] <mnemon> so just wankery about the terminology mostly because of the association to bunch of old pseudoscience ;)
[17:57:54] <evolv> race-based medicine isn't old pseudoscience
[17:58:25] <evolv> although what is intended is population-based
[17:58:33] <Ungwelian> It'd be quite a shame if people insisted that we must all be the same, so medically significant genetic differences can't exist.
[17:59:23] <evolv> race-based medicine is complete bullshit, that is true. Race isn't synonymous with population
[17:59:45] <mnemon> it is often used that way
[17:59:49] <CaCode> genetic medicine would probably mean something like giving people preparations that mute specific genes, or something along that lane
[18:00:05] <Ungwelian> Or maybe retroviral treatment.
[18:00:21] <CaCode> genetic medicine would not have anything to do with a non-existent pseudo-scientific delusion like race
[18:00:26] <Ungwelian> There certainly are cases when genetic engineering could give people healthier, happier lives.
[18:00:29] <evolv> retroviral genetic engineering treatment has been long dead
[18:00:31] <mnemon> Ungwelian: human GM is quite forbidden
[18:00:37] <Ungwelian> Yeah I know.
[18:00:56] <Ungwelian> But I feel sympathy for people who suffer for genetic disorders.
[18:01:20] <CaCode> what do you call it crispr? cispr?
[18:01:26] <Ungwelian> There are cases when the life-expectancy is ~6 months.
[18:01:30] <Ungwelian> Or even less.
[18:01:34] <Ungwelian> And there can be a lot of pain.
[18:01:37] <mnemon> evolv: mostly because there are better tools for most practical applications afaict
[18:01:40] <evolv> CRISPR isn't transgenic, for one
[18:01:50] <CaCode> how exactly does crispr work?
[18:01:54] <mnemon> which are also less potentially dangerous
[18:02:04] <CaCode> it's an insertion into a genom?
[18:02:28] <evolv> it doesn't insert anything into the genome
[18:02:37] <CaCode> evolv what is it?
[18:02:38] <evolv> it edits DNA in the genome
[18:02:45] <CaCode> nitpicky much?
[18:02:50] <evolv> no, that's very important
[18:02:52] <Ungwelian> In human rights agreements, there's talk about respecting the "inherent worth of disabled people". That's important, but it can also be used to deny treatment.
[18:03:00] <Ungwelian> Or even the development of treatment.
[18:03:10] <CaCode> so it edits the genome? how?
[18:03:13] <evolv> inserting genes in a genome requires very specific targeting
[18:03:36] <mnemon> CaCode: it's dna manipulation (ab)using bacterial anti-phage mechanism
[18:03:47] <evolv> the problem is whether the sequence is inserted somewhere unintended
[18:03:52] <CaCode> this seems like the sort of technology that would be all over the news for increasing productivity of all sorts of crops
[18:04:00] <evolv> CRISPR is far more precise
[18:04:24] <mnemon> CaCode: it is
[18:04:32] <evolv> well, there are issues being worked out in CRISPR
[18:04:36] <mnemon> but it's newish
[18:05:10] <CaCode> so is it even used at the moment? i mean creating better grapes or making rain-resistant crops
[18:05:40] <Ungwelian> Maybe in the future, individual genetic medicine will be something like the abortion: instead of strict yes or no, there's law and guidelines for consent and ethical treatment.

[18:06:25] <CaCode> begs the question how do you contain these frankensteininan monsters?
[18:06:29] <evolv> right now, you can't really use CRISPR for developed organisms
[18:06:34] <evolv> for a number of reasons
[18:06:49] <mnemon> not quite, just a lot better than changing random things and trying to find the usefully modded target among lots of failures
[18:06:55] <CaCode> if you release a bunch of edited organisms into the wild how do you prevent them from drowning out the original species?
[18:07:27] <mnemon> make them sterile, although with crops there's quite a lot of backlash against that ;)
[18:07:28] <evolv> chemical induced expression, CaCode
[18:07:31] <pussipupu> sometimes that's why you release them
[18:07:42] <CaCode> they should make it mandatory to make all crispr edited organisms infertile
[18:07:45] <pussipupu> mosquitoes with gene drives for instance
[18:07:52] <evolv> chemical induced expression isn't perfect
[18:07:56] <CaCode> just liek onsanto does with their crops
[18:07:56] <evolv> so there's that
[18:08:03] <Ungwelian> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlequin-type_ichthyosis <-- that's a particularly horrifying example of something that deserves treatment
[18:08:03] <ro-bot-o> [url] Harlequin-type ichthyosis - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[18:09:04] <Ungwelian> "caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the ABCA12 gene"
[18:09:08] <evolv> you can't make genetically modified organisms infertile

[18:09:17] <Ungwelian> If only that gene could somehow be replaced with a functioning one.
[18:09:20] <evolv> I mean, you could
[18:09:26] <evolv> but it wouldn't be worth it
[18:09:34] <CaCode> how does monsanto make their crops one generation viable only?
[18:09:38] *** Quits: e\ (~el@user/eleutheria) (Quit: WeeChat 3.3)
[18:09:45] <evolv> every season you'd have to buy a massive amount of crops and hope you can plant them
[18:09:47] <CaCode> you can't replant you have to buy their seeds
[18:10:03] *** Joins: e\ (~el@user/eleutheria)
[18:10:27] <CaCode> how do mules infertility work?
[18:10:28] <evolv> that's true with seeds
[18:10:43] <CaCode> so you can do it, by some forms of hybridization i assume
[18:10:48] <CaCode> that would be a good aproach
[18:10:51] <mnemon> CaCode: inter-species mixing tends to result in infertility
[18:11:14] <CaCode> create two organism that are both half what you want and hybridize them to create massive numbers of infertile offspring
[18:11:16] <mnemon> but there are some ways around it in parts like with ligers
[18:11:17] <evolv> mules have an odd set of diploid chromosomes
[18:11:26] <CaCode> sort of like star wars clone warriors
[18:12:15] <CaCode> they should use these forms of hybridization as a safe guard for the frankensteinian monsters cripr is going to produce
[18:12:18] <CaCode> make it a law
[18:12:35] *** Quits: Pixi (~Pixi@user/pixi) (Quit: Leaving)
[18:12:45] <CaCode> you could establish well defined clones for two seperate organisms and then hybridize on a massive scale
[18:12:48] <evolv> one thing with plants is that they can undergo endoduplication

[18:12:55] <CaCode> that way farmers would have to keep buying your seed

[18:14:15] <CaCode> all human life is like this massive git repository with countless branches
[18:14:17] <evolv> considering it's my field of study, I found otherwise
[18:14:21] <CaCode> each species being a branch
[18:14:22] <mnemon> it's just bunch of junk that either works and replicates or dies off
[18:14:30] <CaCode> and if you follow it back to the master you get the first cell
[18:15:07] <mnemon> too bad it isn't reversible
[18:15:23] <CaCode> ok if you are truly a biologist, riddle me this: why do men have nipples?
[18:15:56] <evolv> development goes on the "female" track before expression of male sex determining genes
[18:16:31] <CaCode> fair enough, and why do we have massive hair growth on top of our heads but not on our bodies? aside from some select spots, and why there?
[18:16:56] <CaCode> why do we have beards but no massive hair length on the forhead?
[18:17:30] <mnemon> would be kind of inconvenient if it got in your eyes all the time
[18:17:32] <evolv> there are evolutionary speculations for those
[18:17:52] <CaCode> so the way it came about is unknown
[18:18:21] <evolv> of course, we can't go back in time
[18:18:50] <CaCode> I assume the pubes and armpit hair is to spread the pheromones better and the top hair is a sun-hat?

[18:19:10] <Ungwelian> There can be many functions.
[18:19:11] <evolv> they have antimicrobial properties, CaCode
[18:19:24] <Ungwelian> I like to think hair is important for capillary effect and evaporation.
[18:19:38] <mnemon> also keeps the head warm
[18:19:48] <Ungwelian> You get far more evaporation surface with hairs.
[18:19:50] <evolv> hair is also important to protect from skin cancer
[18:20:24] <Ungwelian> Also hair tends to exist specifically in places where there's lots of these immune system glands.
[18:20:34] <evolv> hair on the head, that is
[18:20:44] <Ungwelian> And you need to get rid of the stuff processed by the glands.
[18:20:45] <CaCode> maybe beards are just sexual selection, the quality and amount of beard would inform the female of the amount of testosterone and the over all health of the male
[18:21:17] <CaCode> we didnt need that as man evolved with melanin to protect from skin cancer
[18:21:32] <evolv> lol
[18:21:40] <evolv> tell that to Europeans
[18:21:45] <CaCode> the vulnerability to sunlight only came about as humans entered the areas removed from the equator
[18:21:49] <CaCode> 30k years ago
[18:21:58] *** Quits: saufa (~saufa@m91-129-98-202.cust.tele2.ee) (Quit: Lost terminal)
[18:22:09] <mnemon> most europeans still produce melanin in response to (over)exposure to sunlight
[18:22:10] <CaCode> so basically 15k years ago to 6 k years ago humans lost their pigmentation or reduced it
[18:22:14] <evolv> hair is more protective than melanin
[18:22:15] <CaCode> but it wasnt a prior
[18:22:17] <evolv> btw
[18:22:22] <evolv> hair has costs, though
[18:22:37] <CaCode> the hair on top is not for skin cnacer
[18:22:40] <Ungwelian> White skin is good for the north, though.
[18:22:46] <CaCode> you are mistaken, it is for the prevention of heat stroke
[18:23:00] <CaCode> heat stroke can cause a heating of the bones encasing the brain

[18:23:09] <CaCode> this can't be prevented through melanin
[18:23:13] <mnemon> trying to assign it a singular purpose is silly
[18:23:16] <Digit> "nothing is more hostile than ignorance"  CaCode do i attribute that quote to you?  :)  healthily potent sentiment.
[18:23:22] <CaCode> otherwise we would be all the way fury
[18:23:26] <evolv> wait until CaCode learns about pleiotropy
[18:23:27] <CaCode> or at least noticeably fury
[18:23:33] <evolv> it'll blow their mind
[18:24:14] <CaCode> Digit no this is not my quote, I quoted it myself but i forgot the source
[18:24:19] <CaCode> i think it was some american lady
[18:24:53] <evolv> evolution and genetics are not your strong points, CaCode
[18:24:55] <evolv> it's ok
[18:25:03] <mnemon> was she talking about perceived or outright hostility?
[18:25:06] <CaCode> after all i am no biologist
[18:25:25] <CaCode> i do understand evolution though
[18:25:36] <evolv> we're born, we live, we die, we become born again
[18:25:40] <evolv> wash, rinse, repeat

[18:26:13] <evolv> nah
[18:26:18] <CaCode> i dont want to offend bhudists
[18:26:24] <CaCode> but this is religios not science
[18:27:06] <evolv> there is no evidnece that death is the end
[18:27:10] <Ungwelian> A Buddhist. Heh, I knew it :)
[18:27:20] <Ungwelian> You people really like this no-self -idea.
[18:27:32] <CaCode> what do you mean there is no evidence it isn't the end?
[18:27:33] <evolv> Ungwelian, it's more properly defined as "not self"
[18:27:40] <evolv> no self is, after all, a self-view
[18:27:43] <CaCode> how much more evidence do you need?
[18:28:02] <evolv> more than the principle of parismony
[18:28:06] <evolv> parsimony*
[18:28:12] <CaCode> sigh
[18:28:17] <evolv> that's a heuristic, it's not a substitute for evidence
[18:28:51] <Ungwelian> evolv, don't you think it's kinda nihilistic?
[18:28:57] <evolv> Ungwelian, not at all
[18:29:07] <evolv> why would it be?
[18:29:13] <CaCode> evolve if the tree of life with all its branches is like a git repository with the first cell being the master branch, is cispr a way to merge all the branches into one massive organism?
[18:29:44] <Ungwelian> Well, "not self" :)
[18:29:50] <Ungwelian> What's so bad about self?
[18:29:50] <evolv> not self is a strategy
[18:29:59] <mnemon>  it seems quite at odds with nihilism
[18:30:13] <evolv> because the self is a belief there is something static, unchangeable, permanent
[18:30:26] <CaCode> not neccesarily
[18:30:27] <Ungwelian> That's a Buddhist lie.
[18:30:31] <evolv> yet we are not static, unchangeable, permanent
[18:30:41] <CaCode> you can believe in the self without believing it to be set in stone
[18:30:46] <CaCode> one doesnt follow from the other
[18:30:57] <evolv> what is impermanent, inconstant cannot be self
[18:30:57] <CaCode> you can have a self that changes over time
[18:31:06] <CaCode> who says so?
[18:31:08] * Ungwelian agrees with CaCode
[18:31:18] <evolv> "self" is equivalent to "essence"
[18:31:20] <CaCode> impermanence is a property almost everything has
[18:31:32] <CaCode> including the self
[18:31:32] <evolv> what you're arguing is "conventional self"
[18:31:49] <CaCode> no i am saying just because you change doesnt mean it's not you
[18:32:04] <mnemon> you're arguing using translations/foreign concepts that do not convey the same implications
[18:32:08] <evolv> but it does mean that what changes is not my essence
[18:32:11] <CaCode> just because a flower goes through changes througout its lifecycle doesnt mean it isnt the same flower
[18:32:13] <evolv> does that make more sense
[18:32:24] <evolv> self == essence
[18:32:43] <evolv> essence is defined as something that defines the thing, it doesn't change
[18:32:46] <CaCode> i agree to disagree, just because your self is not set in stone doesnt mean it doesnt maintain its identity
[18:32:55] <evolv> it can be eternal, it can be annihilated, but it cannot change
[18:33:04] <Ungwelian> People can have ego structures. But that doesn't mean that the ego structures are all illusions, wrong or should be changed.
[18:33:21] <Ungwelian> Sometimes people are correct and shouldn't change their opinions.
[18:33:28] <evolv> the change isn't by will, Ungwelian
[18:33:29] <Ungwelian> And should hold onto that truth.
[18:33:34] <evolv> the change occurs despite will
[18:33:38] <CaCode> a changing thing can have an essence
[18:33:41] <evolv> the most obvious is aging
[18:33:45] <CaCode> what ever that is you call essence
[18:34:01] <Digit> "<mnemon> Ungwelian: human GM is quite forbidden"  :O  darkly hilarious these days.
[18:34:03] <CaCode> just because the self changes over the course of a life doesnt mean it isnt the same self
[18:34:07] <evolv> you're in a philosophy channel, CaCode
[18:34:26] <CaCode> you are in a discussion evolv
[18:34:33] <mnemon> Digit: how so?
[18:35:03] <evolv> CaCode, we cannot effectively communicate without some foundation in the words we use
[18:35:07] <CaCode> evolv, change of the self over time doesn't negate it maintaining identity
[18:35:08] <Ungwelian> evolv, sure things change. However, why should that mean that they also don't largely stay the same?
[18:35:37] <evolv> Ungwelian, that is for you to investigate by testing the eightfold path for yourself
[18:35:43] <Ungwelian> Heh :)
[18:35:54] <Ungwelian> You're being a bit arrogant.
[18:35:57] <evolv> no
[18:36:02] <CaCode> evolve you regard the snapshot of the self as the thing, i regard the entire course of the self's development over the course of its existence as the thing
[18:36:24] <Ungwelian> For example, you're making assumptions that I haven't already.
[18:36:26] <CaCode> a movie can have an essence just as much as a still-image
[18:36:39] <evolv> Ungwelian, it's not something that can be intellectually understood. Without a reference, there can be no referent
[18:37:00] <evolv> that is why it requires testing
[18:37:01] <Ungwelian> Yeah, that's what they say :D
[18:37:03] <evolv> empiricism
[18:37:25] <evolv> no thinking through it to get the answer, neither faith
[18:37:28] <evolv> just practice
[18:37:58] <Ungwelian> That's a very structural, and also pro-authority way to approach it.
[18:38:09] <Ungwelian> There's a lot of roads to the religious experience.
[18:38:19] <Digit> "<CaCode> they should make it mandatory to make all crispr edited organisms infertile"  does not seem safe.   given latteral gene transfer's a thing, and could radically disrupt the ecosphere.  recessed genes could reocur under some environmental/epigenetic conditions.   beware the blanket rules and dogmas, emergent exceptions will bite.
[18:38:30] <evolv> it can't be pro-authority if it requires you to do the work
[18:38:31] <mnemon> Ungwelian: "you have to figure it out yourself" is hardly pro-authority
[18:38:41] <evolv> there is no obligation for you to believe it at face value
[18:38:54] <mnemon> maybe s/figure/observe/
[18:38:55] <evolv> it's pointless to do so, it doesn't get you anywhere
[18:39:13] <Ungwelian> mnemon, "just practise".
[18:39:33] <Ungwelian> "do the work"
[18:39:39] <CaCode> evolv as a biologist let me ask you this, the first cell was a single organism dividing itself, all cells that exist today are just as far away from this initial cell as those that had no chanes in their gentic material, when I say that i consider all life on earth to be one huge organism that just differentiated its cells in a radical fashion do you say i am wrong?
[18:39:40] <evolv> like... science?
[18:39:44] <evolv> mathematics?
[18:40:01] <mnemon> yes, to observe some things you first need to do some preparatory stes
[18:40:04] <mnemon> *steps
[18:40:18] <mnemon> kinda like astronomy beyond observing the most notable objects
[18:40:28] <CaCode> Digit how could crispr created frankensteinian monsters be prevented from drowning out the original species in that same niche?
[18:40:30] <Ungwelian> Contrary to some people, I think the religious experience can definitely be intellectually understood.
[18:40:35] <mannequin> anyways
[18:40:52] <Ungwelian> To say that it can't just means that a lot of people don't want it to be intellectually understood.
[18:40:55] <mannequin> if they steal saturn we still have jupiter
[18:41:03] <mannequin> but that a significant loss
[18:41:07] <CaCode> is all life on earth just one organism that differntiated itself into what we see today?
[18:41:11] <Ungwelian> Because to have a specific intellectual explanation for it would take away of the mystery.
[18:41:16] <Ungwelian> And with that, the eschatology.
[18:41:23] <mnemon> Ungwelian: it's a way to say that the explanation is not sufficient for understanding
[18:41:27] <Digit> "<CaCode> ok if you are truly a biologist, riddle me this: why do men have nipples?"  i'm no biologist, but i can offer an answer that surprised me... male nipples, are viably functional.  !!!   men /can/ lactate.  we can develop the buds of boobs, and many do, and, go on, have a feel, see if there's a lump under each, maybe if you've had enough soy & flax...
[18:41:31] <evolv> the mystery is resolved by testing it for yourself
[18:41:37] <CaCode> if a cell divides you cannot tell which one is the parent and which the child, so isnt all life this same first cell still?
[18:41:42] <Ungwelian> mnemon, I could just as well say that the experience is not sufficient for understanding.
[18:41:44] <mnemon> you can s/explanation/knowledge/ I guess

[18:42:00] <mnemon> it isn't automatically
[18:42:08] <evolv> how do you acquire knowledge, Ungwelian?
[18:42:09] <mnemon> as in, that is not the claim
[18:42:12] <Ungwelian> Rather, when people have deeply emotional experiences, it's much more difficult to consider them objectively.
[18:42:28] <Ungwelian> And in organized religious practise, these experiences are then reified.
[18:42:30] <CaCode> Digit, i am disapointed to have no lump, but that is amazing so a single dad in our ancient past could have fed his kids if he had to
[18:42:33] <evolv> how do we know there is anything that is objective?
[18:43:02] <Ungwelian> evolv, now that's a proper question for this channel :)
[18:43:26] <evolv> so we start somewhere, usually with faith in some ontological and epistemological positions
[18:43:47] <evolv> after we place faith in our starting positions, we work from there to determine "truth"
[18:44:01] <evolv> then we shit on others for not placing faith in our faith
[18:44:13] <evolv> something something solipsism AHHHH

[18:45:50] <Digit> " <CaCode> Digit how could crispr created frankensteinian monsters be prevented from drowning out the original species in that same niche?"  that question seems to follow [one plausible] answer.  latteral gene transfer.
[18:46:04] * Digit still insistent he's gonna catch up to chat and get back into "real time".
[18:46:13] <Ungwelian> The gist was roughly separative and unitive consciousness.
[18:46:17] *** Joins: Treefingers (~Glassbox@108.162.189.80.dyn.plus.net)
[18:46:33] <Ungwelian> You can construct and deconstruct.
[18:47:38] <mnemon> Digit: lateral gene transfer just creates more frankensteins :)
[18:48:06] <mnemon> actually better fit for the name even
[18:48:27] <Ungwelian> "al-farq: separation; separative consciousness, the opposite of al-jam'
[18:48:27] <Ungwelian> al-jam': synthesis, union, unitive consciousness; the opposite is al-farq."
[18:48:31] <Ungwelian> That's it.
[18:48:54] <Digit> "<CaCode> is all life on earth just one organism that differntiated itself into what we see today?"  iirc, critters that live on the tusks of lobsters were one of the exceptionals that could be candidates for another distinct lineage of life.  also, then idk how we'd differentiate between convergent evolutions that converge so well as to become compatible and long merged
[18:48:59] <Ungwelian> So taken to the ultimate, I'm sure both of those can lead to "the absolute".
[18:49:17] <Digit> mnemon: more frankensteins?  more scientists?  ;)   [/frankenstein's monster pedantry]
[18:49:19] <Ungwelian> Either you arrive at a point of nothingness, or all.
[18:49:39] <Ungwelian> And then when you subsume the concept of self into that, voila, religious experience.
[18:50:24] <Ungwelian> Then, the order of the psyche goes haywire.
[18:50:35] <mnemon> :)
[18:50:36] <Ungwelian> And all kinds of stuff need to be redefined.
[18:51:09] <Ungwelian> People say that it's the ultimate truth. Others say it's Mushroom Jesus.
[18:51:25] <Ungwelian> I think few people know that the Mushroom Gods lie :)
[18:51:50] <Digit> " <CaCode> Digit, i am disapointed to have no lump, but that is amazing so a single dad in our ancient past could have fed his kids if he had to"  yeah, i dont recall the specifics of conditions that bring it about... presumably, parenthood for a start, maybe hungry children pheramones around, other dietary triggers, etc.    not having it, probably means something for "healthy male " such n such.
[18:52:44] <CaCode> Digit so how about you?
[18:53:02] <Digit> Ungwelian: that sufi 2 consciousness thing almost sounds like the 2 hemispheres thing.  seperative and unitive.

[18:54:15] <Ungwelian> Digit, I guess conceptually it's the same thing. However, IIRR, modern medicine doesn't ascribe to that kind of brain function classification - at least anymore.

[20:28:41] <mannequin> i'm glad you belive me
[20:28:52] <mannequin> because this is most likely truth
[20:28:57] <Jong> Why are some people so into themselves? They want to go hiking, mountain biking, skiing, traveling etc. But do they want to make anything that will make anyone else's life better? Nope.
[20:29:02] <mannequin> very probable
[20:29:34] <mannequin> Jong: planet stealing
[20:30:04] <Jong> Well, they aren't littering and they aren't hurting anyone. So that's good
[20:30:21] <mannequin> it hurts our future
[20:30:28] <mannequin> this stellar system is rich so far
[20:30:46] <mannequin> and if we loose Saturn...
[20:30:47] <arryana> you think that everyone who travels, hikes, or mountain bikes is selfish by definition?
[20:31:01] <arryana> that's a bit judgemental and not at all accurate.
[20:31:19] <arryana> or is that just trollbait

[20:34:33] <arryana> yes you are,
[20:34:44] <arryana> you just said none of them want to make anyone else's life better
[20:35:01] <Jong> can you define what you mean by judge?

[20:52:46] <CaCode> Jong I don't believe taking a walk is neccesarily self-absorbed
[20:53:25] <Digit> Jong: pleasure addiction, perhaps.  it can be quite ego-aggrandising and perspective-insularising.  maybe even set out with, or imagine they still retain, good intentions, but find it hard to have the rubber meet the road, when up against that neurochemical gradient.  like mini coke-head scarfaces.  n_n
[20:54:05] <Jong> CaCode  if all you did everyday was take walks, what are you doing for anyone else?
[20:54:39] <CaCode> Jong what is the obligation towards everyone else compared to one self?
[20:54:39] <Digit> like others here, i suspect the appearance (and breadth of sample set) may be obfuscating good deeds not loudly promoted, and they may not be all so homogenously and absolutely self absorbed.
[20:54:45] <Jong> We don't need all our activity to be that which does something for others. But when none of our activity is that, that says something.

[20:55:05] <CaCode> Jong maintaining your health is already self-absorbed or is there a balance of looking after yourself and also looking after others
[20:55:26] <CaCode> Jong so there is two extremes what is the right balance?
[20:55:28] <Jong> I like balance
[20:55:37] <Digit> Jong: "all you did"... how narrowly are we constricting these walks.  are they not allowed to talk to people they meet on their walks?  are they to only walk in seclusion to not inspire others to walk for their health/enjoyment too?  and so on
[20:55:53] <CaCode> if you don't look after yourself you will fall ill and become a burden to others instead of helping others
[20:56:15] <CaCode> Jong I do not think that going for a walk is neccessarily self-absorbed
[20:56:22] <Digit> yep.  often, you have to look after yourself, so you can look after others.
[20:56:32] <ldlework> clean your room
[20:56:43] <CaCode> if you think about yourself while doing it maybe, but some people go for long walks to think about things that have nothing to do with themselves
[20:56:45] <Digit> one neither exludes nor inevitablises the other.
[20:56:48] <CaCode> or to maintain health
[20:56:59] <ldlework> treat yourself like you're someone responsible for helping
[20:57:17] <Digit> yeps, walks are like a form of meditation.  could be just what's needed to help someone remain ammicale, clear minded, kind, etc
[20:57:26] <CaCode> Jong are others doing anything for you?
[20:57:45] <CaCode> there should be a balance as well
[20:58:08] <CaCode> if you are doing a lot for others others should also be doing things for others
[20:58:28] <CaCode> if those you look after only look after themselves you just turned yourself into a maid
[20:58:33] <Digit> i wonder, how much ~envy~ played a role in Jong's original query.
[20:58:59] <CaCode> Jong ideally a society would have everybody doing something for others
[20:59:18] <CaCode> and ideally everybody who is capeable would also maintain themselves as to not burden others
[20:59:20] <ldlework> objectivism seems more reasonable
[20:59:36] <CaCode> ldlework, that's subjective
[20:59:44] <Digit> Jong: you're not under burnout of the benevolent are you?  if so, please do look after yourself as you look after others, or you'll end up unable to look after anyone, and may even get yourself so sick you start causing more harm than help.
[20:59:47] <ldlework> "seems more reasonable"
[20:59:59] <Jong> I don't know where the taking a walk example came from. I'm talking about people I know who do nothing but travel, hike, mountain bike and post pictures on facebook.  There's nothing wrong with a vacation. But they've been doing this for 2 years now.   They're pharmacists in their 30s who retired early due to some good investments they made.  I couldn't vacation for ever.  It would feel so meaningless
[21:00:24] <ldlework> good for them
[21:00:36] <ldlework> liberty is the freedom to seek your own ends
[21:00:42] <Digit> Jong: the walk example came from: <CaCode> Jong is talking a walk considered part of that list too?
[21:00:45] <CaCode> Jong it depends a lot on, in what kind of society you live, in a society of selfish people it would be fatal to do only things for others, in a society of self-less people it would be fatal to only think of yourself
[21:01:02] <CaCode> a hike is just a long walk
[21:01:12] <Jong> I code software. I feel it's like a painter making paintings. Life without making stuff to show for would be so empty
[21:01:20] <ldlework> a hike is just teleportation with more steps
[21:01:38] <Delf> Jong: Because I'm so bored that I want to entertain myself. Or... I'm so excited to entertain myself, full of energy and curiosity to explore.
[21:01:43] <CaCode> Jong while your coding is important, life is more than just work
[21:01:53] <ldlework> Jong: after coding for 25 years, about 90% of my work is lost to the sands of time
[21:02:10] <CaCode> Jong this entire planet of beauty is wasted if you don't look at it
[21:02:25] <Digit> CaCode: in a society of selfish people, it may be more challenging to overcome that race to the bottom, but, also, all the more important, and may speak all the louder inspiration, to be so selflessly kind.
[21:02:49] <CaCode> Digit dont plan your life around being an inspirational
[21:02:58] <ldlework> it's a presupposition that self-interest is a "race to the bottom"
[21:03:16] <CaCode> Jong in general self-absorption is also a matter of perspective
[21:03:48] <CaCode> something considered completely self-absorbed in a traditional society might not raise any eyebrows in a big city
[21:03:51] <Digit> CaCode: ok.  i'll plan my life around never being principled, and allways following the crowd, regardless of whatever insights of better ways may cross my mind.  ;D ;p  /sarc
[21:04:10] <CaCode> Digit, there you go
[21:04:18] <Digit> lol
[21:05:06] <Digit> ldlework: depends how narrow the self is, and how short the reward feedback loops.
[21:05:20] <CaCode> Jong was bhudda self-absorbed?
[21:05:33] <CaCode> if i am not mistaken he speant years just meditating
[21:05:57] <Delf> What's wrong with being self-absorbed? You can do good for others while being self-absorbed too
[21:06:05] <Digit> iirc, he swung both ways, helping him clearly discern the middle path superior to the extremes
[21:07:14] * Digit just realised he said buddha "swung both ways"... unintended chancing upon a phrase used often as a euphemism for bisexuality.   oops.  XD
[21:07:23] <Jong> I realize I'm being dumb. Those mountain bikers I'm talking about would stop and help someone they saw who needed help along one of the trails they're on
[21:07:36] <CaCode> What do you do if the society that you live in, actively tries to make your life as difficult as possible?
[21:07:40] <Delf> Digit: You did this on purpose. Planned accident.
[21:08:02] <Digit> Jong: mmmm, that's refreshing.  wish i could do that more.   recognize when i'm being dumb.
[21:08:18] <CaCode> Jong I mean not being self-absorbed is great, and doing well for others, but what if the rest of society hates you and tries to destroy you, do you still focus on doing a lot for others?
[21:08:26] <Digit> Delf: if i did, it was subconscious.
[21:08:36] <Delf> Jong: Why so hard on yourself? You're rather intelligent, for recognizing things
[21:08:59] <Digit> tis wise to see ones own foolish steps
[21:09:02] <Delf> Digit: No doubt. We are peasants to our subconsciousness.
[21:09:29] <Digit> lol.  peasants.   oh no, feudalist hierarchy in my mind!   ;D
[21:09:36] <CaCode> Jong I'd say it always depends on the environment you are in.
[21:10:05] <CaCode> for the individual to have a duty to society, society also needs to fullfill its obligations to the individual

[21:26:00] <mannequin> did we sell a planet bfore?
[21:26:10] <Digit> Delf: you did it wrong then.
[21:26:34] <Delf> Digit: Either I did that wrong, or I did something else right
[21:27:24] <Delf> You tell me what you learned post drugs and I'll tell you what I learned pre drugs
[21:27:40] <Digit> i strongly doubt the latter makes for an "or".  you may well have done something else right, but, if you learned nothing from "drugs", you did "drugs" wrong.
[21:28:45] <Digit> might as well shoot straight to the top, my most extreme... from doing several tens of grams of psilocybe semilanceata, cooked with lemon juice, on a 1-day fast empty stomach, i learned omniscience is an experience open to us all.
[21:28:46] <Delf> It disorients my sensory inputs and it affects my emotions
[21:29:14] <Digit> "It"...  are all drugs the same to you?  XD
[21:29:58] <Digit> i also learned stimulants are severely not suited to me, and i learned what it's like to feel "brittle".   one of the worst experiences of my life.  nnnnnever doing speed again, after that first 1 time.
[21:30:23] <Digit> i could go on, but this is not really a drugs chan.  just a couple examples there to show /something/ can be learned from "drugs".
[21:30:59] <Delf> No, they have different effects of course, but in essence they all disorient those. Some decapitate my mental functions too, forcing me to stand down from doing much of anything, for safety reasons
[21:32:14] <Digit> if i toke some pinene rich cannabis, (variously depending on the rest of the chemovar profile) i'll be more clear headed.   ... would you characterise that as "disorient" too?
[21:33:04] <Delf> Not if you say clear headed
[21:33:35] <Digit> cannabis saves my life.  main/first way it does so, is it gives me space to think through my problems.  your characterisation seems like it'd be saying this is a distortion and disorientation... like i should have killed myself in 1999 because that was the not-disoriented not-distorted perception...

" We get affected by drugs more or less the same "... seems a dangerous statement.   everybody has widely different biochemistry and conditions and tollerences, leading to quite widely different experiences and effects.  right from the biochemistry first, before getting to being different individuals with different ways of coping with
[21:48:51] <Digit> things.  it would be dangerous to mislead people with quips aluding to greater reliability of similarity of effects than there likely may be.
[21:49:24] <Delf> There are those differences too
[21:49:34] <Digit> Delf: wat... now you're asserting what my subsconscious is up to, and ascribing all manner of nonsense to me that's not the case.
[21:49:47] <Delf> But the big difference between you and is not our biology for our similarities far exceed the differences we have
[21:50:28] <Digit> idk how you could possibly be making such assertions.  ... do you have some backchannel, i dont know of, for finding out about my unique biology?
[21:51:02] <Delf> No, I'm just making assumptions. If they're inaccurate, I would appreciate it if you correct them
[21:51:31] <Digit> i mean, maybe if you're drawing wider comparisons, so like, compared to a insect's leg, our biology's identical, or some spuriously stretched reasoning
[21:51:41] <Digit> ugh, that's a lot of work.
[21:52:03] <Digit> couldnt you just do thinking instead, rather than getting others to clean up your assumptions for you?

[21:56:26] <Digit> many threats to our lives can exist without our knowing anything of them.

[22:31:38] <Digit> not that i recall... nothing immediately apparent... perhaps in others, but that then just loops back around to that first mentioned frustration with other peoples ineptitudes.
[22:33:46] <Digit> and... frustration that such broad spectrum aptitude tests are not common knowledge, deployed as standard, for everybody's elucidation.  so many dunning-kruger highs and lows could be revealed.  so many wrongly roled people could be better placed.  so many loud-mouths who dont know they dont know, would have a test to tell them to stfu, lol.
