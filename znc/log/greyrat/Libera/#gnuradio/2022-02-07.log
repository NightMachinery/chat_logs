[04:22:12] <tcarls[m]> Am I misbehaving by using a `gr-` prefix for a GitHub repo for a project that uses GNU Radio / contains a few out-of-tree blocks, but doesn't (yet) follow conventions for being buildable/installable the usual way?
[04:24:01] <tcarls[m]> (context: just checked in a first public release of the tool I've been working on at https://github.com/charles-dyfis-net/gr-godox-remote/; it's definitely incomplete and kludgy, and contains something that could be described as a crime against SQLite, but the code that exists _does_ solve a puzzle that someone else building an Arduino-based remote for the same equipment had punted on).
[04:33:29] *** Quits: jstein (~jstein@gentoo/developer/jstein) (Quit: quit)
[04:35:56] <willcode4[m]> tcarls: You can use gr-whatever for whatever you want :-) Typically, gr-abcde means that abcde is an out-of-tree module. But OOTs also use built-in GNU Radio blocks and may come with apps. It's more important that your README says what the software is/does. It would be good if you eventually put everything in a "standard" OOT directory structure, but that's really up to you.

[05:21:29] <dcajacob[m]> Anyone have experience with using differential encoding to resolve phase ambiguity with qpsk using a convolutional codec?
[05:22:16] <dcajacob[m]> I know a unique/known word works, but sometimes we don't have that
[05:22:42] <dcajacob[m]> The differential enc/dec with mod 4 works without a convolutional encoder, but not with it.
[05:27:46] <linext> drmpeg, i ran a test and it sort of worked
[05:28:12] <linext> do you know what the hacktv command would be to transmit VHF or UHF, standard USA analog TV

[06:01:11] <muaddib[m]> <dcajacob[m]> "I know a unique/known word works..." <- There should be SOME correlative properties right??
[06:09:00] <dcajacob[m]> <muaddib[m]> "There should be SOME correlative..." <- For this particular example, not really. But even still, this is something that has bothered me for a long time and I'd love to put it to bed

[06:24:16] <muaddib[m]> So there could be a sync code sequence, but in your use case itâ€™s unknown? 
[06:24:16] <muaddib[m]> Or is it unknown if there is any sync sequence at all? (I think thereâ€™s some exotic comms methods where you could do that)
[06:35:18] <dcajacob[m]> > <@muaddib:gnuradio.org> So there could be a sync code sequence, but in your use case itâ€™s unknown? 
[06:35:18] <dcajacob[m]> > Or is it unknown if there is any sync sequence at all? (I think thereâ€™s some exotic comms methods where you could do that)
[06:35:18] <dcajacob[m]> There is a very short sequence that is corrupted by scrambling
[06:36:08] <dcajacob[m]> So, it's not really useful. But again, this isn't really about howto get it done any way.
[06:36:37] <dcajacob[m]> I can just brute force search the different roatations to see what decodes and I do do that.
[06:37:08] <dcajacob[m]> But every source says differential encoding should work too, but I find it doesn't when convolutional encoding is involved.
[06:44:11] <linext> anyone transmit ATSC over hackrf?
[06:47:37] <muaddib[m]> <dcajacob[m]> "But every source says differenti..." <- Gotcha. You are specifically interested in the differential approach. 
[06:47:47] <dcajacob[m]> Yep
[06:48:07] <dcajacob[m]> Works great without convolutional encoding.

[14:29:47] <ahmad_sho[m]> I have a OFDM Tx/Rx simulation in GRC, the channel is ideal with no noise, so there BER is 0. I added a second receiver. Now the first receiver is showing non-zero BER. 
[14:30:56] <ahmad_sho[m]> as soon as I remove the second Rx (which is not connected to the first one at all, at least from what I know), BER in the first Rx goes back to zero.

[15:29:40] <ahmad_sho[m]> <willcode4[m]> "Sounds like a rate-matching (..." <- I used the provided examples to create a complete OFDM Tx Rx.

[15:39:20] <willcode4[m]> First, do you see the same effect with the channel model bypassed (not just set to zero)? The clock sync can drop/insert samples in order to synchronize on the frame. If it does, then potentially samples can be dropped in one chain or the other and you would get a non-zero BER. This is a guess. Second guess: do you still have a throttle in both the tx and rx? There should be only one throttle in the entire flowgraph.

[16:09:56] <ahmad_sho[m]> <willcode4[m]> "What if you branch after the..." <- I'm using schmidl-cox (as in the example). I tried branching after the sync chain (and therefore after the demux between the header and the payload), and demodulated the same payload in a different chain. the results are even worse.
[16:14:59] <willcode4[m]> Looks like the channel estimator can also adjust the rate.
[16:15:01] <ahmad_sho[m]> in fact, the results are not worse, but not much better. I'm trying to pinpoint the problem, so I was enabling the blocks one by one. now, I got away with adding the FFT block in the second chain without creating problems to the first chain. when I was branching after the model and throttle, adding the FFT block in the second chain will cause problems to the first one.

[16:30:00] <willcode4[m]> Both chains feeding off the same stream, in this case. If you have 2 different receivers in the same flowgraph, it could be worse.

[16:37:02] <ahmad_sho[m]> willcode4[m]: Thank you.
[16:37:49] <willcode4[m]> The two USRP sources would have to share a clock - be two channels on the same USRP or be otherwise sync'd.
[16:42:26] <ahmad_sho[m]> I'm waiting for additional hardware to test the two cases on my small test bench. We have a large MIMO platform available (multiple RIOs, FPGA cards, octoclocks...) that eventually I want to run MIMO applications on using gnuradio, but that is a subject for another episode.

[18:44:38] <willcode4[m]> PMTs are odd data structures, so it's not obvious which way is more efficient anyway. If you can, do to_python() once and use the result multiple times.
[18:49:00] <Jacob[m]12> If you only need one field, it's best to get just that. If you need many fields converting the dict once is probably a good idea. If this is performance critical you probably want to benchmark the specific situation you care about.
