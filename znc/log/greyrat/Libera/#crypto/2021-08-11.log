[00:56:37] <TimMc> Interesting that SHA-224 is just a truncated version of SHA-256... except with different initial state. Why different? What kind of attack would that protect against?
[00:57:24] <TimMc> Or to put it a different way, why specify SHA-224 at all and not just say "hey you can also truncate the SHA-256 output"?
[01:00:19] <ms7821> someone might say "field a is sha224, field b is sha256" and not realise they're related?'

[01:11:49] <danieldg> TimMc: if you have a system that produces a MAC based on either hash (and you don't use HMAC) then you can forge one using the other, vs as they are now you can't
[01:12:53] <danieldg> not that anyone sane would make a system where that's a threat, but lots of defenses are protecting from dumb things like that and it sometimes turns out useful
[01:17:28] <TimMc> I think that makes sense to me -- "why not, only reduces footguns".
[01:20:22] <TimMc> ms7821: Ah, I think I see what you mean about that -- the truncation has to have a name, and if it has a different name it should never be "compatible".

[04:50:15] <harwiltz> Hello all. I'm working on a project that uses an API that requires an API token which is retrieved from an environment variable. I'm trying to run my code on a cluster, and I want to keep my API token secure. However, the cluster operates in batch mode (ie, I won't be able to enter a password to unlock a keyfile), so I'm not sure how to proceed. I was thinking about encrypting a file containing the
[04:50:17] <harwiltz> API token, which I can then decrypt in my login node (where I can enter my GPG password) and export the token to an environment variable. Is this a bad idea?
[04:51:09] <danieldg> you're relying on the cluster to handle secrets either way, check if the cluster itself supports secrets
[04:53:23] <harwiltz> danieldg: sorry but what does it mean to secure secrets?
[04:54:53] <danieldg> depends on the system
[04:56:00] <harwiltz> ok, I'll try to contact a sysadmin
[04:56:27] <danieldg> sometimes it's file permissions, sometimes you store things on a tmpfs instead of on disk, etc
[04:58:04] <harwiltz> danieldg: why do file permissions matter if the sensitive data is in an environment variable?
[04:58:25] <danieldg> it's not always in an env var
[04:59:48] <harwiltz> danieldg: but when it isn't in an env var, it'll be encrypted

[22:50:05] <TimMc> Freneticks: It's not even a cryptography question. Can you give each object a unique ID?
[22:50:38] <Freneticks> TimMc: yeah how do you prevent copy of the object and the ID ? like a bottle of vine
[22:51:50] <danieldg> this is a physical security question - there are lots of anti-forgery or anti-tamper products you can use
[22:52:07] <Alipha> affix something like a TPM to it such that removing it would destroy it which contains a private key that it could sign challenges with. then it's a challenge-response instead of a signature though.
[22:52:12] <cehteh> Freneticks: by cataloging its microscopic impperfections, for a bottle of wine the pattern on the cork might be already pretty hards to reproduce
[22:52:56] <ericonr> Don't use the tamper proof sticker I get for my food deliveries, it's 
[22:53:02] <ericonr> .... Very bad
[22:53:25] <Freneticks> I was thinking if we can solve this problem with crypto but it seems absoluty not solvable

[22:53:58] <TimMc> Freneticks: I mean, you can't prevent it.
[22:54:05] <TimMc> You can just make cunterfeiting difficult.

[23:02:29] <Freneticks> if the bottle is nft and you buy it but see that the token is not yours on the blockchain you know that you just lost 1m$
[23:02:34] <woggle> I guess one probably gets into high-end HSM levels of tamper-resistance engineering if you want to embed the chip in the wine bottle in a way that hard to remove without damage...
[23:02:59] <cehteh> i think its reasonably easy to identify real world objects when you put the right efforts into it
[23:03:40] <TimMc> Freneticks: Sure, or you can just have a central registry with the wine seller.
[23:04:07] <cehteh> as long you have access to the original you can find and record unique features that are almost impossible to forge
[23:04:14] <Freneticks> yeah interesting i'm just thinking
[23:04:55] <Freneticks> cehteh: yeah but you need a 1m$ glass
[23:04:57] <danieldg> the producer can take a detailed photograph of a unique pattern (cork for wine is a pretty good idea) and publish it for all bottles
[23:05:24] <danieldg> basically all natural objects have uniqe patterning
[23:05:28] <cehteh> Freneticks: see what i saied above .. make a high res photo of the pattern of the cork for example
[23:05:30] <yawkat> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_unclonable_function
[23:05:44] <TimMc> Glittery nail polish is pretty unique, and I recall someone using that to make their laptop tamper-evident. :-)
[23:06:27] <danieldg> heh, probably also reduced the interest in tampering as a side effect
[23:06:28] <cehteh> you may even do some fancy scanning like microscopic 3d model and IR spectroscopy of that 
[23:06:41] <TimMc> danieldg: Or at least in theft. :-)
[23:07:07] <TimMc> But you could also extract a fingerprint from that nail polish and hey, hard-to-forge ID.

[23:10:08] <cehteh> at least not with reasonable effort .. 
[23:11:49] <cehteh> basically you have a pretty good random generator here 
[23:12:12] <TimMc> Yeah, as long as you can avoid crystal formation or other order-generating effects.
[23:12:13] <woggle> I suspect the idea of "reasonable effort" would change if it was actually the sort of thing someone would spend 7 figures to forge, but that's almost never a scenario people care about.

[23:14:04] <cehteh> woggle: then you make this nail polish thing more complex
[23:15:33] <cehteh> like multiple layers, bigger, diffent kinds of glitter (maybe actual cystals with well defined properties)

[23:16:05] <TimMc> I guess what you really get here is a randomized hologram.
[23:16:07] <woggle> I would guess, practically speaking, for things with that sort of rarity, needing to explain how you acquired the thing convincingly (who you bought it from, etc.) is a big obstacle to presenting a forgery.
[23:16:16] <cehteh> but i think even a single drop of nail polish cant be reproduced with todays technology in a reasonable way

[23:17:31] <cehteh> also you possibly dont want to rely on some external marking, for example when you have the MonaLisa you can do an exact scan of it under all kinds of wavelengths of light and make an elevation map of the paint
[23:18:32] <cehteh> (of course such a scan could also help the counterfeiters :D ... but it'll be insanely hard to reproduce it)
[23:19:20] <danieldg> maybe find something with irregular crystal formation patterns so that you need to rearrange atoms to duplicate it.  Verifying without an electron microscope might be tricky, but a laser might be able to help?
[23:20:11] <danieldg> like reflection patterns as you move the beam along the surface
