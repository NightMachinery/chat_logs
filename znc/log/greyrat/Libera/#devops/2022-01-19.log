[00:21:46] <pyzozord> hello, I'm looking for a channel where I can ask kubernetes/docker questions
[00:21:56] <pyzozord> is this a good place?
[00:24:33] <rawtaz> you can indeed do that here
[00:24:41] <rawtaz> there's a #docker channel which is better for docker specific questions
[00:24:50] <rawtaz> thers probably also a kubernetes channel, i'd check that if i were you
[00:25:33] <pyzozord> I couldn't find any good kubernetes channel :(
[00:26:52] <rawtaz> what about #kubernetes??
[00:27:44] <pyzozord> it's got 19 nicks
[00:28:49] <rawtaz> no, it has 158 nicks

[00:48:54] <pyzozord> ah, thanks
[00:48:58] <pyzozord> I was looking at alis list
[00:55:35] <rawtaz> hah
[00:55:46] <rawtaz> i never use that. is it really useful?
[00:56:11] <rawtaz> how do you use it? irssi tells me /alis is an invalid command
[00:56:26] <rawtaz> hm /quote alis list works though
[00:56:43] <rawtaz> cool. adding a keyword there works

[20:24:14] <slaughter> Ha! that's pretty good gordonjcp 
[20:24:46] <slaughter> If I had time I'd probably have done a little more fun stuff like that, my talks are always at the code school so I have flexibility to be silly
[20:25:02] <slaughter> But I've been in 5+ hours of interviews every day for a week and I am getting a bit burnt out
[20:25:55] <slaughter> 6 hours of zoom today let's do it
[20:26:38] *** Joins: shad (~shad@user/shad)

[20:45:54] <Joel> I hate interviewing.
[20:48:55] <slaughter> I haven't had to do a code challenge yet
[20:49:00] <slaughter> Though I think in the interviews today I will
[20:49:25] <slaughter> Bonus for me: I don't need the job I'm interviewing for at all, already have offers, so no pressure whatsoever 
[20:50:07] <slaughter> Hell my first offer came after a 45 minute quick "ok let's pull in this dude and this dude real quick" interview. Look at my resume, look at my linkedin, done

[21:57:53] <rawtaz> slaughter: if you have that much experience, why do you have to do 5*5 hours of interviews? :O like why dont you just get an offer right away
[21:58:13] <rawtaz> must be some really large horrible companies with too much HR department(s) in it
[21:58:57] <slaughter> I've been interviewing at a million places. I don't have that much experience though, 5 years in software, ~2.5 devops
[21:59:07] <rawtaz> also im curious what those interviews consisted of, did you talk programming problems or something where you had to solve stuff?
[21:59:08] <slaughter> And the 5 is a technicality, actually closer to 4
[21:59:14] <rawtaz> h ok
[21:59:23] <slaughter> Nope haven't had any programming challenges yet - not til the one I'll do today
[21:59:23] <rawtaz> but meh, good enough to not have to endure a ton of interviews
[21:59:41] <slaughter> Mostly just "tell me about your experience with docker" or "what kind of CI/CD pipelines have you used" and stuff like that
[21:59:49] <rawtaz> ah
[21:59:53] <slaughter> Lots of culture fit stuff, that's been the predominant line of questioning
[21:59:57] <rawtaz> "i use it every day" and "make" then :-)
[22:00:03] <slaughter> Working with ambiguity, hard problems, etc
[22:00:13] <slaughter> Lol yeah I actually used that answer for a lot of questions
[22:00:28] <slaughter> "Tell me about a time you had a hard problem to solve" - "I literally do that every day I work, can you be more specific?"
[22:00:52] <slaughter> "blah blah cross-functional work experience" - "Every. Day. It's my job."
[22:06:28] <rawtaz> yeah sigh. "tell me about" blah. it's so utterly pointless.
[22:06:32] <rawtaz> fuck itt
[22:06:41] <rawtaz> that's why i just keep working on my own instead
[22:07:04] <slaughter> Eh some of it is ok, when it's engineering questions anyway. "Tell me about your ownership of a technical project" or "what's the thing you've built you're most proud of"
[22:07:08] <rawtaz> cant be arsed to deal with that stuff to "convince" someone that i can actually deliver something. i have better things to do.
[22:07:20] <slaughter> "Have you ever built infra from greenfield? What about inheriting infra?" etc
[22:07:28] <rawtaz> well
[22:07:39] <slaughter> I just enjoy talking about that stuff though so might be justme
[22:07:43] <gordonjcp> 18:37 < slaughter> "Have you ever built infra from greenfield? 
[22:07:51] <gordonjcp> slaughter: you mean Easy Mode?
[22:07:51] <rawtaz> what *about* inheriting infra? that's a silly question. what would there be about it? you take it, you manage it, you do what needs doing with it. what other answer is there?
[22:07:57] <slaughter> gordonjcp haha yuuuuuuup
[22:08:35] <gordonjcp> slaughter: I work for the third biggest fire brigade in the world
[22:08:42] <gordonjcp> slaughter: it's fucking comical
[22:08:45] <slaughter> rawtaz well you inherit the infra at a company. What was good? What was bad? What challenges did you face getting up to speed? What opportunities did you see to improve things? What best practices did you follow? It's a decent question
[22:09:00] <rawtaz> slaughter: it's irrelevant
[22:09:13] <gordonjcp> slaughter: they've changed the infosec rules so that only highly-privileged ISE accounts can do something as outré as "show ver" on Cisco kit
[22:09:18] <slaughter> Don't know that I agree on that rawtaz 
[22:09:27] <rawtaz> slaughter: apparently not :)
[22:09:27] <slaughter> Lol gordonjcp infosec at that level is a joke
[22:09:53] <slaughter> But I get your point 100%. I just happen to like talking about that stuff quite a lot and see it as a chance to effectively humblebrag
[22:10:00] <gordonjcp> slaughter: now they know they haven't got a proper inventory of their Cisco kit, despite having just rolled out a lot of new stuff recently, so they want someone to log into every single Cisco router and switch, do "show ver" and copy and paste the results into a spreadsheet
[22:10:16] <gordonjcp> slaughter: so now they have to hire a very expensive CCNP-level contractor to do that
[22:10:21] <slaughter> And in the case of going into a company and inheriting their infra, it's relevant to the position. Getting an idea of what kinds of things I might start poking etc
[22:10:28] <rawtaz> i think that what's relevant is discussing potential problems and technology where you *reason* about things rather than try to remember details about the hundreds if not thousands of things you did or solved
[22:10:28] <gordonjcp> BeCaUsE iNfOsEc
[22:11:41] <slaughter> rawtaz a good interviewer is going to segue those questions into reasoning discussions. "ok so you did this and that and the other, what if you had this restriction? What if it was setup this way when you got it? Did you think about this thing?" stuff like that. 
[22:11:51] <slaughter> Infosec is just there to scare us
[22:12:11] <slaughter> I mean, it's a good thing obvi but when it's down to a title it's just red tape and scary ooga boogas all day
[22:13:16] <gordonjcp> yea
[22:13:40] <rawtaz> i think theres a discrepancy here. my entire working time ive been doing tons of differnet things. so when people ask questions about specific, which is a drop in the ocean of everything ive done, its hard for me to answer that. mostly because i simply moved on after solving or doing whatever it was about.
[22:13:46] <gordonjcp> the real problems are unaddressed, while they freak out about shit like snmpv2 having cleartext passwords
[22:14:03] <rawtaz> while someone who's been more focused on one or few things have an easier time with this type of bullshit questions
[22:14:13] <rawtaz> of course it also helps not having been in the industry 30 years
[22:14:33] <gordonjcp> omg oh no someone who has already broken into or airgapped fucking network can see the ODU temperature of a couple of very old microwave links
[22:14:46] <gordonjcp> whatever are we to do
[22:15:09] <rawtaz> slaughter: that "ok so in situation X, if you had e.g. restriction Y, what would you change" - that i like. thats *reasoning* right there. just gimme a scenario and i can reason an entire week about it if you want. but dont ask me to try and remember detauls about stuff lol
[22:15:52] <rawtaz> slaughter: so the offer you have is it a good one? :)
[22:16:51] <slaughter> Yeah I've rarely been asked much in the way of specific details - I think they're generally doing A) a quick check that I'm not full of shit and B) finding a good thing to use for the problem solving followups
[22:16:59] <slaughter> Yes, and the one I'll get later today will be even better
[22:17:34] <slaughter> 40%+ raise, better benefits, bonuses, equity (lol whatever, equity isn't real), and so far the work and people sound A++
[22:18:06] <rawtaz> haha thats the spirit :D
[22:19:44] <slaughter> I'm totally not already planning on how to spend that money
[22:19:54] <slaughter> Haha JK I am my house needs things
[22:20:28] <slaughter> Specifically the nicest toilet possible. Cheap crappy small toilets are the biggest bummer in the world
[22:21:30] <slaughter> And more crap for my new RC car hobby. These little things are way more fun than I remember them being as a kid
[22:57:15] <Joel> rawtaz many reasons to seek multiple offers
[22:57:19] <Joel> figure out what you're worth
[22:57:24] <Joel> figure out which has problems you want to solve
[22:57:28] <Joel> figure out which has coworkers you wont strangle
[22:57:47] <Joel> my current co has profit sharing, for example, really cool benefit.
[23:01:07] <Joel> slaughter how long where you at your last gig?
