[00:11:26] <cornfeedhobo> ChinaisSOY: fwiw, debian and ubuntu differ quite a lot in out of the box configuration. what's the network manager in debian buster?

[00:11:37] <ChinaisSOY> has anybody tested it
[00:11:38] <matsaman> ChinaisSOY: yes, you can confirm with ifconfig or ip or whatever
[00:11:52] <matsaman> ChinaisSOY: you need to confirm it's changed _before_ you do whatever it is you're doing that you want it to be changed for

[00:12:16] <coconut> or weechat if you like terminal client
[00:13:12] <ChinaisSOY> How do i script this
[00:13:14] <leftyfb> matsaman: ChinaisSOY is actively being helped in #raspberrypi, where they should be asking for help. You should go there and chime in. Otherwise someone is just wasting their time
[00:13:16] <cornfeedhobo> ChinaisSOY: matsaman has the right idea. essentially you get what ever network manager you are using to invoke macchanger before connecting, or after disconnecting and on boot (so it's just always random)
[00:13:23] <ChinaisSOY> I need it to be changed first thing
[00:13:30] <ChinaisSOY> I dont want the Router to see my origional ISP ever

[00:16:23] <JonathanD> You can edit it by replacing the network adapter.
[00:16:41] <cornfeedhobo> but yeah, what they are saying. the only thing you can do is configure it after boot. the network adapter mac is hardcoded

[00:18:25] <ChinaisSOY> Thats why I need permanant spoofing
[00:18:32] <leftyfb> ChinaisSOY: your "standard OS" in not supported here. Go to #raspberrypi for support
[00:18:34] <matsaman> ChinaisSOY: you can boot with networking mostly disabled, and then run a script to randomize the mac, and then run a script to ensure the mac was randomized and only then enable networking
[00:18:38] <cornfeedhobo> you should switch to a privacy focused os that does this out of the box, it sounds like. otherwise, you need to be willing to spend more time picking apart your setup and fixing it
[00:18:40] <JonathanD> You would need something hardware level, then.
[00:19:17] <JonathanD> If I was that worried about the end device leaking, I might put something on the lan in between them.
[00:19:20] <matsaman> but this isn't something you'd want to do with a computer at your home or place of business
[00:19:33] <matsaman> if you care about changing your mac, you should be using someplace else's network also
[00:19:48] <leftyfb> I love the whole purpose behind this though. They say there router is "backdoored". Like randomizing your MAC is going to do anything

[00:20:57] <ChinaisSOY> Then the wifi to ethernet devices MAC would be seen by the router, instead of my Raspberry PIs
[00:21:01] <JonathanD> I don't know of one. You'd have to implement something. Like anything that does NAT in between would cover it.
[00:21:05] <cornfeedhobo> ChinaisSOY: you don't need to hide your mac unless you are connecting to a router you don't control.
[00:21:06] <leftyfb> or ask for support for an OS in a completely different OS's support channel
[00:21:09] <ChinaisSOY> But i feel that we should be able to permanantly randomize MAC more easily and reliably
[00:21:25] <ChinaisSOY> Right, the router Im connecting to, I dont control, its a backdoored ISp router
[00:21:40] <cornfeedhobo> .... then just put a router in front of it

[00:25:07] <[twisti]> i hope its okay to post this again, it seems like the question was lost in that bizarre troll story about living under a bridge; can i somehow see what version a package is in 21.04 without having 21.04 installed ?
[00:25:17] <nick4765> Wow. Well, I mean, hey what have I got to lose? Can always put it back. Let me try that. I'll be back in a little bit. So your slot 1 is "top" and slot 2 is "down" from there, correct?

Second, it shows that slot as x8 and there isn't an option to switch to x16 so I'm looking into that on the hardware side of things. Might need to update BIOS
[01:43:30] <Simmer> Yes, no doubt. I'm still in BIOS on my main PC so it will be a few for that command. I will paste as soon as possible.

[02:23:26] <Simmer> BIOS update complete, went smooth. Interestingly enough the option I was looking at prior that showed only x8 was renamed to "PCIEx16_2 Bifurcation" where auto is x8 or you can split it to do a hardware raid or other. Also guessing it ONLY affects slow 2 which I am not using anymore, back to slot 1. In GPU post it says nvidia GPU running at native
[02:23:26] <Simmer> x16 so it all seems okay and I think I was just confused on the previous name before it was updated to reflect the bifurcation ability.
[02:23:37] <Simmer> Makes way more sense now, I use bifurcation on my server board.

[14:11:04] <CyL> alkisg: So this means Xubunt LTS kind of have the exactly same support cycle as Ubuntu, and I get no benefit from going that route?

[14:21:27] <CyL> I mean, I'm willing to install Xubuntu on this new computer because of XFCE, but for me it is important to count on the 5-year support cycle of Ubunntu (I mnight upgrade earlier, of course, but knowing I can keep it for longer is important). That's why I thought of Instaalling regular Ubuntu and then installing XFCE afterwards. But if these two routes are actually the sam, I might just install Xubuntu

[14:54:01] <TomyWork> i have no idea. i'm hoping grub takes care of that
[14:54:46] <TomyWork> you probably have to bind-mount /dev and /proc and such btw

[17:55:34] <thinkofher> and i'm wodnering whether it is some his fault or is it seriously something broken in repositories, did anybody here had some problems after latest updates?
[17:56:08] *** Joins: samir (~azureuser@user/samir)
[17:57:05] <rbasak> It's possible. There's always a risk that updates unintentionally break something, though of course we do as much as we can to minimise that risk. Please could you be more specific about the problems?

I read there were issues with WoL with that driver and device which don't seem to be totally ironed out. Use "ethtool" to control the WoL setting
[20:52:39] <BinarySavior> oh okay'
[20:52:48] <BinarySavior> i do know that my particular mobo is not capable of WoL
