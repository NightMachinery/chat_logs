[00:03:25] <NoImNotNineVolt> luke-jr: furthermore, the message of mine which you quoted was a descriptive statement about the topic(s) of the channel, and was not a directive to limit the scope of the channel.
[00:04:20] <NoImNotNineVolt> if complaining about websites is also one of the topics of this channel, then i'll update my description in the future.
[00:04:45] <NoImNotNineVolt> i also have some complaints about how randall's been really slow to update xkcd some days. what's up with that?

[09:16:14] <yanmaani> Because there are, as an actual matter of fact, conceptual issues with L2 solutions
[09:16:27] <yanmaani> Specifically, Metcalfe's law, everyone's best friend, talks about "connections in a network"
[09:16:40] <plankster> lightning does tend to centralize things, the bcashers were right about that
[09:16:50] <plankster> not as much as federated sidechains tho
[09:16:51] <yanmaani> But as a practical matter, when you're starting to do stuff like the lightning network, you're not really dealing with the same network anymore
[09:17:37] <yanmaani> Lightning has centralization tendencies too, but that's not really bthe main problem. I think the best choice would be to try and do decentralized side-chains somehow.
[09:17:38] <plankster> yeah its a totally different paradigm. the nodes are no longer on an equal playing field
[09:18:01] <plankster> the nodes who can open more channels and fund them with greater amounts of cash will naturally have an advantage
[09:18:16] <yanmaani> There's research on this, and it's all very embryonic, but from what I understand, you can - at least theoretically - run a big-block sidechain, and then just do net settlement on mainchain every now and them
[09:18:31] <plankster> yeah but then who runs the sidechain
[09:18:35] <yanmaani> That's not what I'm talking about. I should stop speaking in riddles
[09:18:50] <plankster> i thought i was following, maybe not
[09:18:58] <yanmaani> So, if you have Bitcoin, then you can use that with Bitcoin merchants and all that stuff
[09:19:09] <yanmaani> someone lists a bitcoin addy, you can pay them, you know that stuff
[09:19:16] <plankster> sure, right, great
[09:19:23] <yanmaani> but if you have "bitcoins", and they want "lightning bitcoins", then you can't really do that
[09:19:40] <yanmaani> or if you have "lightning bitcoins" and they want "bitcoins", same problem
[09:20:07] <yanmaani> for all intents and purposes, except for the "having a bitcoin-shaped unit of account", they're two different currencies
[09:20:14] <plankster> right, theres the settlement fee that creates friction
[09:20:47] <yanmaani> I don't think "fee" is even the right way to put it. It's two different cryptos that happen to be pegged with each other.
[09:21:01] <plankster> ehh idk about that
[09:21:14] <yanmaani> It's like if everyone started using Litecoin for transactions, but still kept their cold vaults in Bitcoin
[09:21:30] <plankster> its certainly much more straightforward to convert btc on mainchain to lightning btc than it is to convert btc to e.g. ltc
[09:21:43] <plankster> you dont need a third party
[09:22:10] <yanmaani> I'd argue the opposite. Because as a practical matter, everyone already has the integrations with either bitcoin RPC, or something like BTCpayserver, or a 3rd party processor hooked up
[09:22:22] <yanmaani> and expanding that to litecoin is basically just a matter of changing a few config settings
[09:22:51] <yanmaani> whereas implementing LN with invoices and stuff, that's some serious work
[09:22:53] <yanmaani> Like, you *can* do atomic swaps with LTC and BTC
[09:22:56] <plankster> but thats the merchants, not the customers
[09:23:00] <yanmaani> which means you don't need a trusted third party
[09:23:28] <plankster> people keep saying that, but ive never seen a way to do atomic swaps without a third party
[09:23:36] <plankster> theyve been talking about it for years
[09:24:28] <yanmaani> Well, for the customers too. You can either download litecoin electrum, which works exactly like normal electrum except it's gray instead of yellow, or you can get this whole other thing, which will be a totally new software and everything
[09:24:43] <yanmaani> I'm pretty sure it exists? The issue is just that centralized whatever is still cheaper and easier.
[09:24:46] <plankster> wait electrum is yellow
[09:25:00] <plankster> also electrum has lightning integration, soooo
[09:25:03] <yanmaani> I mean the logo. Bitcoin electrum's gonna have the yellow bitcoin logo
[09:25:12] <plankster> oh i thought it was orange lol
[09:25:37] <yanmaani> yellow, orange, whatever, myself I'm a proud user of a TN panel, I can hardly tell red from blue
[09:25:51] <plankster> idk what that is, are you colorblind?
[09:26:01] <plankster> not tryna make fun of you if you are
[09:26:06] <yanmaani> yeah electrum does lightning, but it's still a totally different system, so at some point you gotta be asking yourself, why would people migrate to this
[09:26:22] <plankster> tiny fees are nice
[09:26:23] <yanmaani> not really no, I just have a shitty uncalibrated monitor
[09:26:28] <plankster> oh nice
[09:26:36] <yanmaani> Right, but why would people choose lightning other than, like, litecoin or monero or whatever
[09:26:53] <yanmaani> And the answers people give all seem aimed at, roughly, "people really like their bitcoin-shaped unit of account"
[09:26:55] <plankster> idk because its cool and future
[09:27:02] <yanmaani> "store of value" and that whole thing, yeah
[09:27:58] <plankster> and also because it makes more sense to accept bitcoin and lightning than it does to accept bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin, monero, dogecoin, and whatever the new popular shitcoin is i dont really keep track
[09:28:12] <yanmaani> I mean yeah but so are some altcoins :)
[09:28:23] <plankster> are they really
[09:28:33] <yanmaani> I don't think that. For the merchant, it's not easier. If all his customers insist on using LN, I guess, but otherwise no.
[09:28:33] <plankster> or did their devs get marketing degrees
[09:28:58] <yanmaani> A lot of them are shit, but there's some new technology in some of them.
[09:29:28] <plankster> eh i guess i have no sympathy for merchants
[09:29:51] <plankster> theyre all gonna end up using some service like zap anyway
[09:30:01] <yanmaani> Oh, and this thing with Bitcoin as a unit of account, frankly I don't buy it
[09:30:19] <yanmaani> Because in practice, everyone uses the dollar anyway.
[09:30:45] <yanmaani> Had things happened very differently, you might have had an actual economy with BTC-denominated loans and price stickiness etc.
[09:30:57] <plankster> bitcoin is _a_ unit of account, not _the_ unit of account
[09:31:04] <yanmaani> But when it's just "the volatility of X coin is better than the volatility of Y coin"...
[09:31:25] <yanmaani> Well, hardly anybody uses it as such. Nobody sells something for 0.00001 BTC or whatever, they sell it for $5 or whatever
[09:31:29] <plankster> when i think about the future of bitcoin, its mainly states that hold bitcoin and control the mining
[09:31:35] <yanmaani> "$5 worth of bitcoin"
[09:31:48] <plankster> and they also continue issuing their own currencies backed by their bitcoin reserves
[09:32:06] <yanmaani> right, which brings us to the "I want Bitcoin to exist so that its price can go up", which is I guess what a lot of people are starting to say openly
[09:32:28] <plankster> well thats kinda crucial to it being able to serve as a reserve currency
[09:32:47] <plankster> were still in the bootstrapping phase imo
[09:32:50] <yanmaani> Yes, but at some point you have to ask yourself what the arbitrage condition is.
[09:33:00] <yanmaani> Because back in the day, it was something along the lines of, Bitcoin will be used as a currency.
[09:33:01] <plankster> i dont understand what you mean
[09:33:15] <plankster> bitcoin is used as a currency tho
[09:33:39] <yanmaani> Well, sure, but the idea was that people would use Bitcoin as they use the dollar or whatever, and this would give it value.
[09:33:46] <plankster> its used as a speculative instrument as well, but that doesnt stop people from using it to transfer value
[09:33:46] <yanmaani> Because you'd have structural pressures to hold it.

[09:33:57] <plankster> wellll
[09:34:10] <plankster> the thing that gives bitcoin value, in my view, is kinda weird and fucky
[09:34:18] <plankster> its all the electricity that goes into mining it
[09:34:30] <plankster> if miners cant recoup that cost, then it goes to zero
[09:34:46] <plankster> so by necessity, the price increases to cover the cost of electricity going into mining it
[09:34:54] <plankster> it doesnt really make sense to me
[09:34:58] <plankster> but its worked so far
[09:35:09] <yanmaani> Whereas now, the idea is that Bitcoin will be some kind of reserve. But why would people use it as a reserve? If they'd use it as a reserve because it's valuable/stable, and it becomes stable/valuable because states use it as a reserve, you maybe see the problem here.
[09:35:24] <yanmaani> I think you'd do good to read NN Taleb's "bitcoin black paper"
[09:35:31] <plankster> nah fuck taleb
[09:35:51] <plankster> i dont think youre on the right track thinking of "people" using it as a reserve
[09:36:10] <yanmaani> Well it's the same for states no?
[09:36:14] <plankster> the gigantic staring-you-in-the-face value proposition of bitcoin is that its a currency not controlled by any government
[09:36:28] <plankster> that is attractive to pretty much any government that isnt the US
[09:36:40] <plankster> (who currently controls the reserve currency)
[09:37:06] <yanmaani> That doesn't give it value, per se. You still need to have some kind of arbitrage condition.
[09:37:16] <yanmaani> The old idea was that it'd become valuable cause people used it for trade.
[09:37:20] <yanmaani> And that's basically buried now.
[09:37:25] <plankster> the value lies in what can or cant be done with a currency that no government controls
[09:37:31] <yanmaani> And the question is what incentive someone would have to maintain a Bitcoin reserve.
[09:37:56] <yanmaani> Well ,if you're talking about storing value, why would any government trust it to do that, for one?
[09:38:04] <yanmaani> It's not really a currency, that's your main problem
[09:38:06] <plankster> bitcoin is valuable to cuba because it cant be used to sanction them and prevent access to vital supplies
[09:38:25] <plankster> but theyre all hardline communist so they dont see it that way because of what bitcoin is used for today
[09:38:32] <yanmaani> that's not really true - cuba could just as well trade in roubles or gold or whatever
[09:38:47] <plankster> not really
[09:39:00] <yanmaani> their problem isn't really that they can't use the dollar. Dollar sanctions, as a practical matter, are bad because they hurt your access to the global financial system.
[09:39:02] <plankster> because the US financial system touches all of those other currencies and the companies that use them
[09:39:04] <yanmaani> Stuff like SWIFT.
[09:39:31] <yanmaani> But the "Bitcoin financial system" doesn't really exist, if everyone's on all of these L2 solutions.
[09:39:40] <plankster> the benefits of bitcoin as a reserve currency dont really kick in until it _is_ a reserve currency
[09:40:02] <yanmaani> theoretically cuba could just trade bilaterally, this wouldn't be hard for them to set up. Cuba's main problems aren't related to a lack of Bitcoin but other stupid stuff
[09:40:36] <plankster> i mean one of their main problems is that they cant import goods to fix their electrical grid
[09:40:49] <plankster> because their transactions are censored, to use bitcoiner lingo
[09:40:55] <yanmaani> If all you want is "dollars", without the financial system, that's not exactly hard. Just like the lightning network gives you synthetic bitcoins.
[09:41:25] <SireWolf> p2p trustless ledgers have too many applications to list, and (almost?) all of them are subject to network economics
[09:41:28] <yanmaani> Just take $1,000,000 of gold, write swaps with the gold and the dollar with some Russian bank or whatever, have it settled in gold and there you go
[09:41:55] <yanmaani> plankster: that's because they don't have any money and so on, not because they don't have the US financial system
[09:42:03] <plankster> but then whatever russian company is helping you finance that is going to be impacted by sanctions
[09:42:04] <yanmaani> there's not really anything of value that cuba can sell, dollars or not
[09:42:22] <plankster> not really true, they sell a lot of sugar cane
[09:42:28] <yanmaani> You do have lots of companies outside of the US that are fine with that though.
[09:42:37] <yanmaani> yeah but what's the going rate of sugar cane to barrels of oil
[09:43:00] <yanmaani> SireWolf: right, which is why the lightning network is not gonna be your saviour
[09:43:09] <plankster> im gonna need a source or two for that claim that there are lots of companies outside of the US that are fine with being sanctioned :)
[09:43:17] <yanmaani> Iran wouldn't give a single hoot about selling oil to Cuba...
[09:43:27] <plankster> right, and so they do
[09:43:34] <plankster> and then their tankers get impounded
[09:43:43] <plankster> that literally happened a year ago
[09:43:53] <plankster> or maybe it was venezuela
[09:44:18] <yanmaani> wasn't that for other stuff?
[09:44:26] <plankster> pretty sure it was oil tankers
[09:44:30] <yanmaani> the bullshit in the strait of hormuz or whatever
[09:44:37] <yanmaani> japan was involved somehow too
[09:45:18] <plankster> yeah here we go https://sofrep.com/news/us-seizes-iranian-oil-tankers-bound-for-venezuela/
[09:45:46] <plankster> like no, bitcoin wouldnt address military power of this sort
[09:46:20] <plankster> but again, the benefits of bitcoin being a reserve currency dont kick in until it is already a reserve currency. cuz that would entirely rewrite the rules of the game
[09:46:34] <yanmaani> on a basic level, the US isn't gonna sink naval vessels that are en route from Iran to Cuba because that's all sorts of illegal, but also if they did, bitcoin wouldn't really help them
[09:46:40] <yanmaani> "Iran’s ambassador to Venezuela denied the accusations of the U.S. that the Iranians either owned the ships or had been involved with the seized shipments."
[09:46:47] <yanmaani> total nothingburger
[09:47:07] <plankster> i feel like were getting lost in the weeds here a bit
[09:47:12] <yanmaani> "would rewrite the rules of the game" - how? Governments don't really have a problem that's solved by bitcoin!
[09:47:13] <plankster> but tbf there are lots of weeds
[09:47:19] <yanmaani> normal people might have, yes
[09:47:38] <yanmaani> but that all flies out of the window once you start talking about "store of value" and small blocks and LN and stuff
[09:47:56] <plankster> it would rewrite the rules of the game by taking away hegemonic power over currency
[09:48:16] <plankster> states would be forced to compete against each other for control of the reserve currency by funding mining operations
[09:49:35] <yanmaani> None of what you said there really follows from anything else
[09:49:46] <plankster> :(
[09:50:19] <plankster> i mean i see how it does
[09:50:21] <yanmaani> For one, what is "currency" here? Are you talking about the financial system and its network effects, or about something else?
[09:50:37] <plankster> im talking about the unit of account used to settle debts between states
[09:50:39] <yanmaani> Because the raw "store of value" effects of the dollar aren't really that hard to replicate.
[09:51:06] <plankster> yeah, but the "not being controlled by any one state" part of bitcoin is quite hard to replicate
[09:51:13] <yanmaani> but secondly, even if it did, why's bitcoin so special? And why would anyone fund mining operations?
[09:51:16] <plankster> once you accept that shitcoins arent gonna do the job
[09:51:24] <yanmaani> uh, gold, oil, bancor, almost anything
[09:51:56] <yanmaani> yeah that's the other thing - why bitcoin specifically?
[09:52:09] <plankster> what else can you use to settle debts electronically
[09:52:22] <yanmaani> why is settling them electronically important?
[09:52:31] <yanmaani> you could just send a plane over with gold bars once a year
[09:52:37] <plankster> because you dont have to ship shit around, that costs money
[09:52:38] <yanmaani> But alternatively, the Bancor would work.
[09:52:48] <plankster> the bancor doesnt exist tho lol
[09:52:50] <plankster> bitcoin does
[09:52:51] <yanmaani> not terribly expensive

[09:53:26] <plankster> why not use the thing thats purpose built for the use
[09:53:30] <yanmaani> because you can use them for settling debts?
[09:53:37] <yanmaani> because bitcoin is not very well suited for it?
[09:53:45] <plankster> how is it not well suited for it?
[09:53:49] <yanmaani> like it basically boils down to
[09:53:49] <yanmaani> "iran please pump my bags"
[09:53:51] <yanmaani> but they're not really interested
[09:53:54] <yanmaani> they have other things to worry about
[09:54:10] <plankster> you want the world reserve currency to settle quickly, yes?
[09:54:17] <plankster> you want all the transctions to be auditable?
[09:54:22] <yanmaani> for one, it's not really a good store of value, it's not controlled in the way that states want, it has very little guarantees of stability
[09:54:31] <yanmaani> no, quick settlements aren't vital
[09:54:41] <plankster> id say theyre desirable
[09:54:58] <plankster> and i would expect bitcoin to become less volatile the more valuable it becomes
[09:55:00] <yanmaani> not to a state. Iran and EU are doing non-dollar trade, and it's not involving Bitocin
[09:55:09] <plankster> but this is when my argument starts breaking down
[09:55:18] <plankster> because i cant argue for things that i expect to happen
[09:55:23] <yanmaani> There they're just doing a complicated settlement system
[09:55:42] <yanmaani> For Bitcoin to become less volatile, you'd need some kind of supply and demand curve.
[09:55:46] <yanmaani> Like for the dollar
[09:56:07] <yanmaani> if the dollar crashes tomorrow, American cars and steel and stuff suddenly becomes ultra-cheap
[09:56:10] <plankster> seems that something that will happen
[09:56:27] <yanmaani> if the dollar goes up by 100x tomorrow, American imports become ultra-expensive, so people stop buying
[09:56:36] <yanmaani> and Americans start iimporting like hell
[09:56:38] <yanmaani> So you have a built-in stability here
[09:56:40] *** Quits: thanas (~thanas@user/thanas) (Quit: ZNC - https://znc.in)
[09:56:55] <yanmaani> the stability of the dollar visavis the Euro, say, is guaranteed by the US-EU trade volume
[09:57:06] <yanmaani> With Bitcoin, you don't really have this same thing
[09:57:07] <plankster> right. when you start to price things in bitcoin, it will bring stability because of the greater arbitrage potential
[09:57:08] <plankster> no?
[09:57:15] <yanmaani> Np, because nothing is quoted in bitcoin.
[09:57:27] <yanmaani> So if bitcoin crashes by 50% tomorrow, that doesn't make the "bitcoin economy" twice as cheap
[09:57:32] <yanmaani> because there is no bitcoin economu
[09:57:35] <plankster> yeah i think i addressed the current state of affairs with "start to"
[09:57:56] <yanmaani> Right. But nobody has an incentive to price stuff in Bitcoin, because it's a strict loss for them.
[09:58:12] <plankster> except people living in el salvador :)
[09:58:19] <yanmaani> No?
[09:58:22] *** Joins: thanas (~thanas@user/thanas)
[09:58:26] <plankster> why not
[09:58:34] <yanmaani> They're pricing stuff in dollars, and possibly settling them in bitcoins
[09:58:34] <plankster> they have to accept it anyway
[09:58:43] <plankster> might as well have a dollar and bitcoin price
[09:59:07] <yanmaani> Well, sure, but the bitcoin price will just be set by multiplying bitcoin by dollar price
[09:59:12] <yanmaani> so the dollar price will be e.g. $100
[09:59:34] <yanmaani> bitcoin price will be 0.001623, say
[09:59:37] <plankster> i can think of some crafty businesspeople who would try to make a bit of money arbitraging the price difference
[09:59:39] <yanmaani> and updated by a computer every second
[10:00:16] <yanmaani> So if bitcoin crashes by 50%, then the bitcoin price will just instantly go up to 0.003246 let's say
[10:00:35] <yanmaani> So it's more than just offering prices in bitcoin, they have to be sticky too.
[10:01:05] <yanmaani> So if I say, I'm selling one whatever for 0.001 Bitcoins, that will do the trick. And then people buy more if BTC goes down, and less if it goes up.
[10:01:18] <plankster> its a natural consequence of more money flowing into the system that the price will be harder to change
[10:01:49] <yanmaani> No, because that money flowing in isn't price-sensitive.
[10:02:00] <yanmaani> What you'd need is someone who says something like, I have a big pile of bitcoins
[10:02:10] <plankster> more money on the order books makes the price harder to move
[10:02:11] <yanmaani> I will sell if it goes above $XXXXXXXXX, and buy if it goes below $XXXX
[10:02:37] <yanmaani> Right, but the money has to be on the books. It's not enough that the money just exists. They have to have a view as to what price they're comfortable holding at and not.
[10:03:00] <plankster> isnt that what order books are for?
[10:03:39] <yanmaani> yes, but you have to use them too
[10:03:49] <yanmaani> there's not really any price-sensitivity on the part of bitcoin people
[10:03:55] <yanmaani> nobody wants "0.001 of bitcoin"
[10:03:57] <plankster> who are these people with the money to move order books who arent using them
[10:04:00] <yanmaani> they want $100 worth of bitcoin
[10:04:12] <yanmaani> uh, everyone who owns bitcoin pretty much?
[10:04:30] <plankster> im talking about how bitcoin could be used in the future and youre talking about how people are using it now
[10:04:41] <yanmaani> Yeah, in the future, same problem.
[10:04:52] <plankster> i dont think so
[10:04:58] <yanmaani> At that point does someone say, "bitcoin is at $10,000,000 now, that's overvalued, I'll sell"
[10:05:15] <yanmaani> that implies such a thing as an arbitrage-based pricing model for bitcoin, by necessity
[10:05:31] <plankster> for bitcoin to get to that point there would have to be much much more money on the order books
[10:05:38] <yanmaani> but the only reason someone sells or buys, now or in the future, is because they have an expectation of how the price will move?
[10:05:40] <yanmaani> ...no?
[10:05:46] <plankster> definitely yes
[10:05:52] <yanmaani> If Iran goes and buys 500,000 bitcoins once and keeps them in a box, then what
[10:05:59] <yanmaani> that money is on the order books precisely once

[10:07:46] <plankster> all those people who wont get involved until it gets "serious"
[10:07:53] <yanmaani> If anything, it's the other way around. When the price goes up, people buy more, because of a future expectation. That's not really how you get stability.

[10:08:06] <yanmaani> What reason would they have to sell at a certain price point? There's never any arbitrage value.
[10:08:11] <plankster> well thats not what happened with the recent ATH, is it
[10:08:23] <yanmaani> If Bitcoin goes to $0.001, there's not really anything you can do with a quadrillion bitcoins.
[10:08:29] *** Joins: h4rd3n3D_ (~h4rd3n3D@wireguard/tunneler/h4rd3n3D)
[10:08:42] <plankster> nor can you ever have a quadrillion bitcoins lol
[10:08:54] <yanmaani> And if Bitcoin goes to $1000000000, there's not really any reason to suggest that's not a reasonable price
[10:09:01] <yanmaani> I mean sure, you can say stuff like "it's a bubble"
[10:09:04] <plankster> sounds reasonable to me
[10:09:07] <yanmaani> but other than that, there's no pricing model.
[10:09:15] *** Quits: technonerd (~techno@user/technonerd) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[10:09:36] <yanmaani> Right. For Bitcoin to be stable, there'd have to be some kind of "alternate use" for it. Take an oil-based currency. That's stable enough.
[10:09:38] *** Joins: thanas (~thanas@user/thanas)
[10:09:46] <plankster> ok i gotta cut this off
[10:09:52] <yanmaani> Because if oil's uber-cheap, people use it more.
[10:09:52] <yanmaani> And if oil's uber-expensive, people use it less.
[10:09:54] <plankster> thanks for the feedback tho
[10:09:55] <yanmaani> So there's some stability in the oil price.
[10:10:02] <plankster> :)
[10:10:04] <yanmaani> That's not true for Bitcoin.
