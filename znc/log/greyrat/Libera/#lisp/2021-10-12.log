[01:36:40] <Odin-> Well, I'd argue that because of the non-updated nature of the CL spec, there are nowadays quite crucial libraries that aren't very application-oriented.
[01:36:59] <edgar-rft> The advantage of having a pretty-much specified language like Common Lisp is that it's very likely that your code still will run in ten or twenty years in the future with noo need of major rewrites or modifications. The disadvantage is that thing that worked poorly in 1994 still work poorly in 2021.

[01:38:05] <mfiano> Common Lisp has many non-application-oriented libraries. Things like MOP extensions and implementation portability libraries are common. Most CL projects are attempts at bending the language to do things that are normally extremely difficult in other languages.
[01:38:25] <skeemer> edgar-rft, the second principle applies in every language, something that worked poorlu in 1994 will not work at all in 2021
[01:38:26] <mfiano> Which can then be used for building applications, but usually, more bending :)

[02:01:47] <moon-child> beause, sure, you can _always_ rewrite code; or build a compiler from one language to another
[02:02:45] <moon-child> that doesn't mean lisp code written in the 60s _works_ in common lisp or scheme, any more than it means algol code _works_ in a c compiler if you're stephen bourne

[02:29:19] <moon-child> hmm.  My impression is that SQL, apl, forth, prolog, and smalltalk have been developed further and are largely incompatible across modern implementations.  Mumps, rexx, pl/i, and basic are mostly dead

[10:12:56] <mishugana> Hello folks, back again with the sbcl-loading-quicklisp issue. I timed it, and it takes around 40 seconds for (load #P"~/quicklisp/setup.lisp"). Anybody else face that issue?
[10:13:17] *** Joins: xiews (~wxie@116.237.117.210)
[10:13:55] <mishugana> `sbcl --no-userinit` is practically instantaneous, so I suspect the issue might be with quicklisp. I had a suspicion that it might be asdf, but loading asdf directly is superfast.
[10:14:20] <mishugana> Maybe some issue with some networking stuff that quicklisp might be doing inside `setup.lisp`?
[10:14:56] <wasamasa> try bisecting setup.lisp, see what part of it takes long
[10:15:01] <mishugana> Anybody else face this issue? I don't think the OS matters, but I'm on macOS Mojave.
[10:15:17] <mishugana> wasamasa: Hmmm
[10:15:56] <mishugana> As an aside, the only way to work without quicklisp is basically to download the dependencies myself and load via asdf, right?
[10:16:34] <mishugana> I took a look at clpm, but that didn't work either with some crypto issue that I'm too tired to debug, qlot uses quicklisp internally from what I've seen, so there are no options in the package space from the looks of it
[10:16:59] <mishugana> Shame, I really wanted to get back to CL, but if I can't make this work then I think I'll go with Clojure instead.
[10:18:32] <wasamasa> people downloaded random lisp files for decades, lol
[10:18:38] <moon-child> mishugana: is this on a fresh quicklisp installation?  Try wiping it out and reinstalling?
[10:18:54] <wasamasa> the existence of package managers is quite new if you take the sheer age of things into account
[10:19:46] <mishugana> moon-child: I uninstalled quicklisp and tried, same issue. I even tried installing the client and quicklisp directory from 2010 from the github site, but same issue (or maybe it didn't work correctly with versions as I expected).
[10:20:11] <mishugana> Initially I thought the problem was sbcl (since I'm building it from source), but that wasn't the case, apparently.
[10:21:02] <moon-child> tried ccl?
[10:21:03] <mishugana> wasamasa: I agree, that's true, but today working without one is almost unheard of.
[10:21:13] <wasamasa> C does that, lol
[10:21:15] <mishugana> moon-child: I did - same issue :(
[10:21:23] <wasamasa> schemers do that
[10:21:31] <mishugana> wasamasa: I get what you're saying, and I hope you get what I'm saying too.
[10:21:46] <wasamasa> so far I get that something about your system is funny
[10:22:13] <mishugana> Which is strange indeed since when I last tried it, it worked fine (couple of seconds load at most), which was about a year back.
[10:22:50] <mishugana> Hence my suspicion that quicklisp's setup does some networking stuff (?) which might be causing issues with mirrors(?)
[10:22:53] <moon-child> wasamasa: chicken scheme has a package manager I think
[10:23:03] <wasamasa> sure, but that's not the norm
[10:23:20] <wasamasa> plenty of scheme projects just bundle the occasional dependency that's not satisfied by some SRFI
[10:23:29] <moon-child> I think chicken is one of the most popular scheme implementations
[10:23:38] <moon-child> not counting racket of course (which I think has a package manager too?)
[10:24:11] <mishugana> Yeah, and I don't quite like Clojure all that much, but leiningen works fine as well.
[10:24:12] <amirouche> guile has guix (and the deprecated guildhall), chicken has eggs, chez has akku, chibi has snow, gambit has builtin package manager so it is becoming a thing
[10:24:35] <amirouche> tho I agree with wasamasa, pm are not really a thing with scheme.
[10:25:00] <amirouche> there is more monorepos than package managers.
[10:25:41] <amirouche> yes racket has a package manager, it is the command is called `raco`

[11:16:50] <mishugana> Okay, I found out the fucking problem
[11:17:11] <wasamasa> with clpm?
[11:17:21] <wasamasa> hit me up on those crypto errors
[11:17:43] <mishugana> The problem was not with quicklisp. The problem was that in my asdf config file (~/.config/common-lisp/;;(:tree "/Users/z0ltan/quicklisp")
[11:18:33] <mishugana> Sorry, ~/.config/common-lisp/source-regsistry.conf.d/projects.conf file, I had (:tree "<my home path>/dev"), and `dev` contained a whole bunch of nested directories
[11:18:59] <mishugana> I changed that to `dev/projects/common-lisp` which is where most of my CL projects live, and that fixed the bloody issue.
[11:19:20] <mishugana> I know it's mostly my fault, but that fucking configuration is ridiculous as well.
[11:19:28] <mishugana> Just putting it here in case people run into the same issue.
[11:20:17] <wasamasa> lol
[11:20:31] <wasamasa> I could say that about leiningen configs
[11:20:53] <wasamasa> but I don't use clojure anymore, so I mostly forgot about that
[11:21:05] <mishugana> Salt on wounds, eh? :P
[11:21:21] <mishugana> I don't like Clojure either, but I was at my wit's end with this issue... heh
[11:21:22] <wasamasa> s-expressions for a config is a neat trick, but not a panacea
[11:22:18] <mishugana> Though this issue is more with the way that asdf locates projects. If there was a way to specify a metadata file in the local project that asdf could pick up, that'd be wonderful, but unfortunately not so.
[11:27:46] <wasamasa> ok
[11:27:55] <mishugana> Anyway, thanks for the discussion. It motivated me enough to try and find out the root cause of this annoying issue.
[11:28:14] <mishugana> It is strange though that asdf still takes so much time for a moderately deeply-nested directory
[11:30:00] <mishugana> ~/dev:$ find . -type d | wc -l
[11:30:01] <mishugana>    51746
[11:30:01] <mishugana> ~/dev:$ find . -type f | wc -l
[11:30:01] <mishugana>   380561
[11:30:11] <mishugana> Not too bad in my opinion, but still large
[11:30:25] <mishugana> Anyway, thanks again, and till next time! :-)
[11:30:36] <mishugana> I'm happy that I can stay with CL
