[00:16:29] <Baphomet> I have suspected... Anyway, when I run git pull it complains about the lack of --rebase, --no-rebase or --ff-only because of conflicts... While I used the manual to understand the idea of the rebase, when it comes to a rebase on a pull command it kinda confuses me
[00:16:33] *** Joins: Willtech (~Willtech@user/Willtech)

[00:17:02] *** Joins: sobkas (~sobkas@95.175.17.217)
[00:17:58] <Baphomet> i.e. I created a branch p/some-patch and checked out, then I ran git pull... Am I rebasing the remote branch onto my local one? Or vice-versa
[00:19:10] <ikke> Baphomet: you would rebase your local commits on top of what you fetched
[00:19:51] <j416> Baphomet: git pull is git fetch + git merge. With --rebase, it's git fetch + git rebase.
[00:20:33] <j416> Baphomet: all commands typically operate on what is currently checked out unless otherwise specified
[00:21:10] <j416> Baphomet: so, you would be fetching from the remote, then merging that into your own branch, or, in the case of --rebase, rebasing your branch on the remote branch
[00:22:08] <Baphomet> Ohhh, I see... So, if I want to merge the remote patch I want to use --no-rebase on the pull command, and then I run git rebase rebasing the remote retrieved code (now on my checked out branch) into my main branch?
[00:22:27] <j416> merge is the default unless you configured it otherwise.

[10:32:16] <Hash> Hi
[10:32:33] <Hash> Is it normal to lose local changes if I git remote set-url to git@ instead of https?
[10:32:47] <Hash> I did that, and now I think all my local changes are gone, which were not comitted.
[10:33:06] <Hash> Does changing remote do away with local uncomitted changes? Is there a way to get them back?

[10:41:59] <vanessa> Is Microsoft trying to EEE git?
[10:42:07] <bookworm> yes
[10:42:10] <bookworm> !next
[10:42:10] <gitinfo> Another satisfied customer. NEXT!
[10:44:13] <vanessa> So, the other day I was trying to clone a repo from MS and the files were not downloaded properly and my script was throwing a lot of errors.
[10:44:57] <vanessa> So I looked into it and the solution was to use a MS's `git lfs` command to download the files.
[10:46:26] <vanessa> if the files are incorrect how does even git's commit checksum pass.
[10:56:33] <ikke> vanessa: when using lfs, the actual files are not committed
[10:56:37] <j416> vanessa: git-lfs is a third-party thing that replaces the files with just empty pointers
[10:56:38] <ikke> just some metadata about the files

[13:32:38] <cousteau> On a slightly less off-topic matter than my previous remark... do you know of any way to properly handle Word documents in git, or know of an alternative format that will be more git-friendly?

[13:34:13] <Tix> cousteau: this kind of documents are basically compressed xmls, so, no. You can use md files if you can, or any non-compressed file formats

[15:33:35] <euouae> Hello in `git log --graph --oneline` what do the colors represent?
[15:34:06] <euouae> I think each color is the color of the parent commit. So if a commit has 3 children, they all have the same color lines?

[15:36:22] <euouae> but would you say that at least the above is true?
[15:36:49] <euouae> not that colors are unique necessarily, but that definitely commits with 1 parent have the same color
[15:37:42] <euouae> because I'm noticing that as lines go up, they keep their colors as they branch
[15:38:12] <euouae> the other question about --graph: is the vertical direction the time axis? i.e. commits /above/ came later?
[15:38:13] <osse>  I doubt it's true as git walks backwards through the log. But i'm not completely sure

[17:29:13] <wakeup> I was working on the master branch. I created new files there. However, I realised I should have been working on a different branch because those are new features. So, I created and switched branch with `git switch -c <new-branch>`. There I saw the changes, so they were "copied" from the master branch. I switched back to the master branch and the
[17:29:13] <wakeup> new files were still there. I though they would disappear and only be in the new branch. Anyway, I switched back to the new branch, and added with git add my_files the new files. I switched back to the master branch and the files were also added there in the master branch. I wanted only to add them to the new branch. How can I solve this problem?

[20:15:18] <tga> hey, I am trying to run a big reformat on main and also, independently, on a branch
[20:15:41] <tga> practically there are no conflicts because the changes are the same in both branches -- but I get a weird merge conflict like this https://dpaste.org/Ewmg
[20:16:12] <tga> on a merge does git care how the changes were made or does it only diff the two files?
[20:16:47] <selckin> doesn't care
[20:17:20] <tga> then why am I getting that merge conflict?
[20:17:44] <thiago> because they are *not* exactly the same
[20:17:56] <thiago> were the two files identical before the change?
[20:18:24] <tga> they were identical, then the branch modified and then formatted the file, and main only formatted the file
[20:18:45] <thiago> there you go. There's a conflict.
[20:18:46] <tga> so from the point of view of the merge, main was modified _after_ the branch by the format
[20:19:08] <tga> is there a standard way of resolving this automatically?
[20:19:09] <selckin> i use kdiff3 as a mergetool, and it can often automatically resolve somewhat trivial things git doesn't
[20:19:24] <tga> I think intellij also has a "magically fix this for me" button
[20:19:30] <thiago> merge conflicts cannot be resolved automatically. A human is always required.
[20:19:33] <tga> aka apply non-conflicting changes
[20:19:34] <thiago> kdiff3 is pretty good
[20:19:38] <thiago> but you still need to review
[20:20:19] <tga> oh so the thing would probably be to pull in changes into the branch then
[20:20:43] <tga> or rebase, but I'd need rerere for that, not too exciting
[20:20:57] <selckin> or you know, rebase, don't do evil refmats and multiple branches
[20:20:59] <tga> I have lots of commits on the branch that I'd have to all walk through the big reformat

[20:22:16] <thiago> what's already branched for older releases doesn't need it

[20:22:40] <tga> can't reformat only in main because I still need to bring the active branches in sometimes
[20:23:00] <thiago> what's "bring" ?
[20:23:05] <tga> selckin: sounds like the best plan, start rebasing and then when it stops on conflict, reformat
[20:23:08] <tga> merge
[20:23:20] <thiago> merge them up to  main?
[20:23:25] <tga> yes
[20:23:40] <thiago> well, sorry. You have to suffer if you want to reformat.
[20:23:42] <tga> I am trying to come up with a plan to best do that after reformatting main
[20:23:52] <tga> I'm starting to realize there is no way out :)
[20:24:00] <tga> no *easy way out
[20:24:08] <thiago> you can choose to reformat all of them so future merges are simpler, or suffer when you merge but solve simpler conflicts
[20:24:11] <thiago> no
[20:24:54] <tga> I guess I could squash branches to a single commit that I can reformat and rebase
[20:25:03] <tga> trade some history for sanity
[20:25:43] <selckin> something like for commit in branch; do git chekcout commit -- .; ./reformat; git commit -m "old messsage"; done
[20:26:55] <tga> uh how would the second commit work though
[20:27:22] <tga> wouldn't that create a duplicate (formatted) on top of the branch?

[20:29:53] <selckin> you have no conflicts since you throw away the working dir everytime, and reset to the state of the unformatted commit, then format it, in the end you should have the same changes formatted
[20:30:08] <tga> I need a bit of time to digest this
[20:31:40] <tga> sooo is that committing each formatted commit to the same branch or a new branch?
[20:32:50] <selckin> http://pastie.org/p/2s0uzsM8mdPzXgz12RCuoZ
[20:32:54] <selckin> at least i think it should work :x
[20:34:25] <tga> a-ha, I was missing the "make a new branch" part
[20:34:38] <tga> I thought you were talking about committing them back to the same one and that didn't make any sense
[20:34:47] <tga> so you're recreating the open branch, just reformatting each commit
[20:35:03] <selckin> yeah, then back to normal
[20:35:11] <selckin> can oneshot format master & branches
[20:35:45] <tga> thanks, that makes sense

[22:17:29] <Sven_vB> hi :) when I fetch just a single branch, is that guaranteed to not accidentially fetch unrelated commits, e.g. because they're in a pack together with related commits?
[22:17:56] *** Joins: justAstache (~justache@user/justache)
[22:18:11] <DoofusCanadensis> when you fetch you fetch the repository... i.e. everything
[22:19:26] <ikke> That's not true, you _can_ fetch just a single branch
[22:19:29] <Sven_vB> then why would the first sentence of the man page say (emphasis mine) "Fetches >>named heads or tags<< from one or more other repositories,"?
[22:19:46] <DoofusCanadensis> oh, my bad then
[22:20:54] <Sven_vB> or is there any other way to safely download public parts from a repo where some branches' data must be kept secret?
[22:20:58] *** Joins: daoudr (~daoudr@xdsl-31-164-222-159.adslplus.ch)
[22:21:35] <Sven_vB> should have been "easy way". I know enough complicated ones. :D
[22:23:01] <Sven_vB> in addition, the copy is between network shares, no git server involved that could restrict the access.
[22:25:55] <Marmotte> secrets should not be commited (or at least, in a separate repo)
[22:27:20] <Marmotte> you can decide, client-side, to fetch only some objects, but IIRC, this is not possible server-side
[22:27:34] <Sven_vB> they are meant to be merged into the public version after some time.
[22:27:57] <Sven_vB> yeah, thus I asked whether fetching just one branch guarantees it won't accidentially copy more data than required
[22:28:46] <Sven_vB> e.g. maybe becuase required commits are in a pack together with others
[22:28:59] <Marmotte> if you want to keep some data outside the repo but be able to merge later, maybe create a fork ? then merge from the fork when your work is ready
[22:29:03] <ikke> afaik git always generates a pack dedicated for that transaction

[22:35:08] <mackerman> You may need gitolite level of access control to ensure some branches are not available

[22:35:36] <wakeup> this https://stackoverflow.com/a/3690522/3924118 says index = staging area
[22:36:39] <ikke> Yes, but there is a subtle difference
[22:36:44] <Sven_vB> mackerman, we can prevent them from the attempt using policy; my concern is about accidential copying
[22:37:29] <wakeup> which is?
[22:38:00] <Sven_vB> I mean, if it happens, it costs just a wipe and restore, but if that's easy to avoid, better.
[22:38:42] <ikke> wakeup: if git says that your working tree is clean, do you think there is anything in the staging area?
[22:39:04] <wakeup> what do u mean by clean?
[22:39:05] <Sven_vB> the stash might be
[22:39:10] <wakeup> do you mean when you type git status?
[22:39:30] <ikke> 'nothing to commit'
[22:39:56] <wakeup> well, if there's nothing to commit, then I think the staging area is empty, no?
[22:39:58] <ikke> wakeup: yes, I mean git status
[22:40:33] <ikke> wakeup: the index is a complete copy of your working tree
[22:41:28] <wakeup> ha, so that's why you say there's a difference?
[22:41:35] <ikke> When you consider your staging area clean, in practice it means there is no difference between the index and HEAD
[22:41:39] <wakeup> well, maybe you're just using these 2 terms differently
[22:41:59] <wakeup> ok
[22:42:01] <wakeup> I see
[22:42:04] <ikke> wakeup: the difference is what people think about when using these terms
[22:42:21] <wakeup> well, I've read many posts and they all say that the index is also called staging area
[22:42:31] <ikke> so a file is considered tracked when there is an entry in the index
[22:42:33] <wakeup> so I would assume they are synonymous
[22:43:00] <ikke> the staging area is an abstraction
[22:43:06] <ikke> the index is a concrete thing
[22:43:39] <ikke> the staging area is basicaly: 'git diff HEAD'
[22:43:52] <ikke> sorry

[22:44:21] *** Joins: sobkas (~sobkas@95.175.17.217)
[22:44:28] <ikke> A synonym for --cached is --staged
[22:45:26] <ikke> wakeup: I make this distinction because it helps to understand how git determines what files are tracked
[22:45:34] <wakeup> so the staging area is what you want to commit and the index is like a full copy of your working tree with the things you want to commit (i.e. the staging area)
[22:46:05] <ikke> The next commit is created from what is in the index
[22:46:32] <wakeup> so if you never added a file to the repo, then it's untracked

[22:47:32] <wakeup> you modify it
[22:47:39] <wakeup> now it's not staged anymore, right?
[22:47:50] <wakeup> or don't you say that in this case because it was already tracked?
[22:47:51] <ikke> The old contents are still in the staging area

[22:48:55] <ikke> correct
[22:49:14] <wakeup> but "always" i mean, even if you modify the file after you added it to the staging area, it's still staged, at least, the old version
[22:49:42] <ikke> yes, git status would show both changes to be committed as changes that are not committed for the same file
[22:50:37] <wakeup> how do you untrack a file? you need to remove it from the index?
[22:50:45] <ikke> yes
