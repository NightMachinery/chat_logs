[12:21:11] <ManofLetters[m]> people seem to think programming languages are social constructs; I wonder to what extent they are right

[12:45:03] <f-a> I believe haskell is well suited to roguelikes dev
[12:45:14] <f-a> since I think refactoring is a part of the project
[12:45:14] <ManofLetters[m]> yes, it is
[12:45:57] <ManofLetters[m]> BTW, you didn't lie, LH + Allure is > 55K LOC
[12:46:37] <f-a> \o/
[12:48:00] <ManofLetters[m]> LH is the engine for Allure (and has its own sample game bundled)

[20:10:34] <sm> I'm currently trying to force steam to download it on mac
[20:11:18] <sm> out of sheer bloody-mindedness
[20:34:48] <sm> hmm, close. https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD lets you install (most ?) steam games with a repl, including those for other platforms. It downloaded and claims to have successfully installed warsim, but the game's folder is empty
[20:36:03] <f-a> ;_;

[20:38:17] <ManofLetters[m]> you've been had, sm

[21:25:24] * sm registers for Windows Insider Program and begins downloading a 10G Windows 11 image
[21:25:53] <sm> lol it's just like getting software to run always has been
[21:26:08] <sm> jump through hoops of fire to get that game to run
[21:27:40] <__monty__> You need to register to get the VM images now? : (
[21:28:54] <sm> seems so for this one, at least. Now I'm backtracking and trying an older image (windows XP!), which I have to download from the net but it's on archive.org and a checksum is provided...
[21:29:31] <sm> maybe only the windows 11 on ARM is an insider thing
[21:29:56] <sm> it's prerelease
[21:30:38] <sm> (and I realised it's no good for the present task, running i386)
[21:31:23] <sm> might possibly lead to a way to run modern windows though, which would be quite handy for testing
