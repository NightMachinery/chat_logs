[02:26:43] <hoppity> Hi guys, just wanted to say that in the end whoever doubted that I needed to rethink my query before starting to cache things was 100% correct.
[02:27:06] <hoppity> My app is still updating instantly and there was no need to cache things or use materialized views... for now :)
[02:28:21] <hoppity> Sorry I didn't phrase that correctly... I meant to say, whoever suggested to rethink/re-analyze my query was correct
[02:28:31] <hoppity> I believe it was @benwilson512

[02:32:15] <benwilson512> hoppity: glad you got the query fixed!
[02:56:11] <hoppity> What would be the best way to store a date time with time zone provided by the user?
[02:56:50] <hoppity> I need to let a user enter a date time with a time zone of his choosing and then tell another user how many "days left" on his *own* time zone.
[02:59:23] <EdFletcher> Always best to store in UTC and it sounds like you can here: convert on input into UTC, store that, then convert on UI render into the local tz 
[03:02:04] <hoppity> EdFletcher: gotcha thank you very much
[03:02:40] <EdFletcher> hoppity: you bet! üëç

[10:16:24] <serafeim> hello friends
[10:25:11] <Nicd> EdFletcher: it's not *always* best to store in UTC :P
[10:25:23] <Nicd> or rather, UTC alone
[10:26:02] <serafeim> it is
[10:26:14] <serafeim> if you don't store dates in utc your data is broken
[10:26:18] <serafeim> i think we have discussed that again
[10:26:32] <Nicd> maybe, and you'd still be wrong
[10:26:40] <serafeim> no i wont
[10:26:50] <serafeim> it's your opinion i'd be wrong
[10:26:56] <serafeim> my opionion is i'd be right
[10:27:10] <Nicd> and the fact that what I do would not be possible with UTC but whatever
[10:27:31] <serafeim> i'm messing with this stuff for a lot of years and have decided that saving dates in non-utc will come to bite you in the face
[10:27:42] <serafeim> i have already been bitten a lot of times by this
[10:27:45] <Nicd> people get wierdly obsessed about UTC, like it's a part of their identity
[10:28:09] <serafeim> Nicd: i am obsessed because i've lost days on trying to query databases that save local time
[10:28:23] <serafeim> and trying to do crazy date converting stuff 
[10:29:15] <Nicd> sure, that doesn't change the fact that I need local time (or UTC + offset but that's slower). UTC is a fine default choice
[10:30:00] <serafeim> Nicd: well cool i guess you've got a different req
[10:30:18] <Nicd> that's why I said "not *always*"
[10:31:24] <Nicd> codestats is one thing that stores events as (also) local time

[10:42:51] <serafeim> crazy. why do that ?
[10:45:02] <Nicd> because I need it for the hour graph
[10:50:25] <serafeim> hmmm ok 
[10:50:43] <serafeim> still can't understand why but i guess it would be easier to implement
[10:50:51] <Nicd> it is impossible to implement otherwise
[10:52:37] <Nicd> the plugins originally sent UTC but when I made the hour graph I had to change them to send local time. I store the UTC + local offset + local time, because calculating from UTC + local offset would be too slow
[10:53:12] <serafeim> ok
[10:53:44] <Nicd> I seriously need to write a blog post about this because so many people want to argue with me
[10:54:28] <dch> I think it depends on whether you deal with user-facing dates or machine ones
[10:55:22] <dch> and whether you have to accommodate rampant stupidity as when country X changes its daylight savings status by law (like shifting when it happens, or removing it all together).
[10:56:20] <dch> like, you can't store dates in UTC, when it's actually for a repeating weekly meeting at 9am in Morocco, and the 9am should be local time, no matter what the daylight savings state is
[10:56:44] <dch> and then you have 2 other people in the meeting, in America, and Europe, who also have to know that meeting in local time
[10:56:54] <dch> so their meeting time will move a few times during the year

[12:50:38] <serafeim> for anybody interested i built this using hugo + cloudflare + gh actions: https://first-pages.spapas.net/
[12:50:53] <serafeim> not really useful for non-greek people but it's cool i think
[12:51:27] <rawtaz> i like the heading :D
[12:51:44] <serafeim> lol
[12:51:51] <serafeim> it's from a hugo template the console

[12:52:15] <rawtaz> soo, you pull in some data from somewhere by some automated gh action that runs recurringly or is triggered by something, and that grabs the data and turns it into hugo which then generates the site?
[12:53:13] <serafeim> rawtaz: there's a hugo gh action (https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-hugo) ... it runs when i deploy to main: https://github.com/spapas/first-pages 
[12:53:15] <serafeim> it's crazy simple
[12:53:43] <rawtaz> ah ok, so its "just" that you use gh actions to trigger an automatic generation of the site
[12:53:53] <rawtaz> and then use cf to make that show up on that url i guess
[12:56:07] <serafeim> hmmm i think there's netlify in the equation :)
[12:56:13] <serafeim> but i could skip that completely
[12:56:21] <rawtaz> oh my
[12:56:29] <rawtaz> setting up a simple site today seems complex haha
[12:56:32] <serafeim> meh
[12:56:44] <serafeim> i could just setup a github pages for this repo
[12:56:44] <rawtaz> "i just need these four things" :D
[12:56:52] <serafeim> no no. it can be done only with github pages
[12:57:04] <serafeim> and have a dns of `first-pages.github.io`
[12:57:31] <serafeim> then you can add a cname from your dns to that url and be done with it
[12:58:59] <serafeim> i just happened to have accounts to all of these (cloudflare netlify and gh) :P
[12:59:19] <serafeim> also i think that cloudflare can serve pages directly from a gh repo
[13:00:54] <rawtaz> im sure you could just boil all of this down into a 1 kB wasm file that runs on the client side without anything else needed :)

[23:10:00] <hoppity> Hi guys, how can I see a discrepancy between the way that people normally talk about timezones and the way that timezones are handled in Elixir (Tzdata).. People normally talk about MST, PST (Pacific Standard Time) etc, but Tzdata works like: "America/Edmonton". How can I convert between the two?
[23:10:55] <Nicd> problem is that MST, PST might refer to a timezone or just an UTC offset
[23:12:12] <hoppity> I need my users to enter a Datetime and select an option like this from a drop down:  "Pacific Standard Time (GMT -8)" then I want to convert this to UTC and store in my database
[23:12:13] <Mayel[m]> hoppity: https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Calendar.ISO.html#datetime_to_string/12-examples
[23:12:43] <hoppity> Mayel[m]: thank you
[23:12:56] <Nicd> like, I'm in EET in the winter and EEST in the summer. but Europe/Helsinki is the timezone
[23:13:12] <hoppity> no wonder people say Time Zones are difficult
[23:14:00] <Mayel[m]> yeah, if you can have a dropdown with Europe/Helsinki, etc that'd be better
[23:14:38] <hoppity> Mayel[m]: absolutely, I proposed that but the client said: "Nope, that is how Amazon does it and we hate it". LOL
[23:15:47] <Mayel[m]> https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/empy50/i_need_one_of_these/
[23:15:49] <hoppity> So in this string: "Pacific Standard Time (GMT -8)" is GMT-8 a UTC offset? GMT offset? or what is it?
[23:16:13] <hoppity> Mayel[m]: haha love it
[23:16:37] <Nicd> GMT ‚âà UTC
[23:16:59] <Mayel[m]> note the squiggles, lol
[23:17:06] <Nicd> but yes it's an offset
[23:17:06] <hoppity> roughly equals?
[23:17:11] <Nicd> yep
[23:17:33] <hoppity> thank you, I imagine I will simply use one of the Elixir Datetime functions that allow for an offset to be provided
[23:40:11] <wink> hoppity: for extra head->desk moments, e.g. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7399368
[23:42:08] <hoppity> wink: thanks
[23:42:38] <hoppity> I've decided to handle things like this:  https://dpaste.org/Qse1      How bad is it in your guys' opinion?
[23:43:24] <hoppity> There's a typo on that one, this is the good one:  https://dpaste.org/WFSM
