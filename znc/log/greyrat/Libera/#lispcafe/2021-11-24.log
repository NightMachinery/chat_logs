[00:33:38] <gilberth> It's not like my cousin would actually cook.
[00:37:50] <gilberth> shka: Memorial? We have that at the city centre rather. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Nicholas_Church,_Hamburg> The page says it was the world's highest building in 1874 to 1876, which I didn't know.
[00:39:16] <shka> good
[00:40:18] <shka> that's how indiscriminate destruction feels like on the receiving end
[00:41:48] <gilberth> My mother, born 1943, was raised in a building with one outside wall just missing.
[00:44:58] <shka> well, meanwhile, in Warsaw: https://russkiymir.ru/upload/medialibrary/fc7/fc77d2f24f54ae69c536887eabe540c6.jpg

[00:50:12] <shka> no terrible, some buildings still have roofs ;-)
[00:50:25] <sham1> And walls
[00:50:27] <gilberth> Fair enough.
[00:51:59] <shka> 85% buildings in the Warsaw was destroyed during the WW2
[00:52:06] <gilberth> It's kinda interesting that when you keep your eyes open, you still see where the bombs felt. One block would feature no old buildings at all, while the next has all the pre-war buildings still there.
[00:54:44] <gilberth> In the 80ies as I grew up in a very central place in Hamburg, there were still places with no buildings or pretty provisional just one story buildings.
[00:55:29] <shka> well, same in some Polish cities
[00:55:49] <shka> notably in the Wrocław
[00:56:03] <shka> with some buildings still having bullet holes in them

[00:57:03] <shka> Old Breslau
[00:57:32] <shka> not so much in Warsaw because it is rare to actually see building dating back before world war in there 
[00:57:38] <shka> it was completely obliterated
[00:57:45] <gilberth> That picture you posted looks pretty recent judging by the cars.
[00:59:08] <shka> building is not recent, it was simply fired upon with rifle caliber bullets and never renovated
[00:59:37] <gilberth> Sure. But it still is in that bad shape.
[01:00:10] <shka> heh, you never been in Poland i guess :D
[01:00:31] <gilberth> No, I have never been to Poland.
[01:01:01] <shka> it is, gray, ugly, and not well kept up 
[01:02:39] <gilberth> Perhaps like east Germany just after the wall fell. Some areas are still depressingly gray.
[01:05:12] <sham1> There's of course the part where for example with Berlin, one can clearly see which part was west and which one was east. The division is visible in space because of the streetlamps
[01:06:03] <gilberth> Yes, I have seen photos made from space.
[01:06:25] <sham1> It's just so surreal

[03:17:21] <aeth> gilberth: WW2 and the subsequent division of the city probably doomed Berlin to be forever ugly.

[03:28:29] <aeth> probably not

[03:28:34] <aeth> most cities are car cities
[03:28:49] <aeth> New York City is the main exception as far as public transport in the US is concerned.

[03:29:12] <pl> Some of SF is doable 
[03:29:20] <aeth> San Francisco proper might have public transport, but the whole urban area is sprawled throughout a huge "Bay Area" region.
[03:29:48] <aeth> Probably not as bad as cities like LA and Houston that are literally built around the car, even in the city proper.
[03:30:46] <pl> Bay Area is more like "it used to be doable but we not only didn't e, pand but removed a lot" 
[03:31:28] <pl> And during the last 30 years of computer focused industrial build out, the geeks did themselves a self-goal 
[03:33:40] <aeth> The area where I am is pretty bad as far as "carlessness" goes. It's a giant suburban sprawl from northern Virginia almost all the way up to the Maryland-Pennsylvania border (the Mason-Dixon line). The main cities of the region, Baltimore and DC, can best be described as... existing. You could live your whole life without going into Baltimore City proper because everything's built around the Baltimore 
[03:33:46] <aeth> beltway or I-95 (or, further south, the Washington beltway).
[03:36:17] <selwyn> the uk has a green belt that effectively prevents sprawl
[03:36:52] <selwyn> but necessary to consider what life would be like without it imo
[03:37:09] <pl> UK also has distinct difference in what it built that prevents certain aspect of the sprawl 
[03:37:19] <pl> Also, probably more expensive fuel helps 
[03:37:25] <aeth> For most of the US, there's just no barrier for sprawl in the US, especially west of the Mississippi but east of California.
[03:38:06] <hayley> https://knowm.com/products/m-sdc-memristor-16-discrete-32-dip Only US$5.50 per memristor. Hm.
[03:39:30] <aeth> The Baltimore-Washington area could easily double in sprawl. Further south, there's no limits at all until you get to Florida. Parts of the northeast near NYC are probably running into their natural geographical limits, as are the major coastal cities on California.
[03:39:48] <aeth> But then continue up to Boston and you could probably, again, double.

[09:19:13] <gilberth> So they really responded? That surprises me.
[09:19:41] <hayley> Yes, some days after it was taken down.
[09:22:38] <gilberth> What I always missed with my electronic CAD applications is that there is no provision to having order information or the like with the parts.
[09:23:06] <hayley> My not-very-computer-educated friend still thinks the itch.io people would know what the program does.
[09:23:13] <gilberth> Some day, I'll write my own and get rich.
[09:23:46] <hayley> All the online Windows sandbox things don't detect the actually bad program behaviour somehow; it's just my own Windows 8 VM.
[09:24:11] <gilberth> What happened?
[09:24:26] <White_Flame> some one set up us the bomb
[09:24:59] <hayley> gilberth: My friend thought he downloaded a video game, but it was a trojan that stole some authentication tokens for Discord.
[09:26:06] <gilberth> hayley: Ah. How did the program get at the tokens?
[09:26:46] <hayley> I don't really know how it works, admittedly. Haven't finished deobfuscating the JS source (which was left in the binary for...some reason) and I don't have the Discord software installed on my VM for obvious reasons.
[09:27:36] <gilberth> Why do you actually care?
[09:27:49] <hayley> But I caught the program testing the existence of an archive file that BetterDiscord uses, and some symbols like "pwnBetterDiscord" and "Infect" which are obviously bad.
[09:28:16] <hayley> gilberth: Yes, sometimes I wonder why I'm friends with him. But it'd be easier for me if his computer and online accounts weren't FUBAR.
[09:28:32] <gilberth> Yeah, why would they name their symbols that way, anyway?

[09:34:02] <gilberth> hayley: What is JITed?
[09:34:08] <hayley> Well, the program is just the NodeJS runtime with some source strings tacked on somehow.
[09:35:00] <hayley> gilberth: I would guess the en/decoder functions for JSON stuff are JITed. And there is talk of maintaining write barriers, so they have a machine code backend presumably.
[09:35:37] <gilberth> But, why not compile beforehand?
[09:35:43] <hayley> 25.8kLOC of assembler, 24kLOC of Go. Not my favourite combination.
[09:35:45] <hayley> idk
[09:36:10] <gilberth> hayley: 50kLOC for parsing JSON?
[09:36:38] <hayley> 50kLOC for compiling JSON parsers.
[09:36:57] <hayley> "The first thing we thought about was code generation like easyjson. But it comes with schema dependency and convenience losses."
[09:37:26] <hayley> "As for insufficiency in compiling optimization of go language, we decided to use C/Clang to write and compile core computational functions, and developed a set of asm2asm tools to translate the fully optimized x86 assembly into plan9 and finally load it into Golang runtime."

[10:11:31] <hayley> My code got larger?
[10:12:25] <hayley> Perhaps I should check the sizes of the other engines again, but they probably haven't changed as mine is much newer and less stable.
[10:12:27] <gilberth> Yes, code has this property to grow with time.

[10:26:48] <gilberth> No.
[10:27:25] <hayley> I didn't want to say "absurd" because it could have come off as a pointy word in context. So I said "this seems silly", more or less.
[10:27:45] <hayley> "Don't use epithets, that's childish." "lmao"
[10:28:02] <gilberth> Is "silly" an evil word according to their easy-to-blame-policy^Wcode of conduct?
[10:28:24] <hayley> Never read the code of conduct ever.
[10:28:49] <gilberth> The usual thing, nothing extra-ordinary.
[10:29:07] * hayley is a hypocrite, as she suggested instating a code of conduct for SICL, to counter the stereotype that all Lispers are assholes.
[10:29:25] <hayley> Well, I am an asshole sometimes, but only for good reasons. :)
[10:29:58] <gilberth> Who says that Lispers are assholes? And: Why haven't I noticed?
[10:30:18] <hayley> There was a joke like "Progressive bully asks for victims' pronouns before insulting their appearance" or something.
[10:30:49] <hayley> gilberth: Related was that I was called a "whiny little bitch" for writing Don't Build Your Own Lisp.
[10:31:30] <gilberth> Oh really? What that a Lisper?
[10:31:43] <hayley> Nope.
[10:32:32] <hayley> I guess Erik Naggum is perhaps the poster-child CL asshole. And I have a "policy" where I decide if the subject of anything I write really deserves politeness.
[10:34:14] <gilberth> Anyhow, you name the very problem I have with all this code of conduct stuff and our local recent trend to bend language to have a gender neutral form [and confusing grammatical gender with actual gender]. When you do not buy their idea, that there are borders between people because of gender, height, mass, colour, whatever, you're easy to be blamed as an asshole. I don't draw those lines, "they" do.
[10:34:41] <gilberth> I won't call Erik Naggum an asshole.
[10:35:15] <hayley> e.g. people exhibiting the behaviour in "Ethical software is a sad joke" probably don't mean to be bad, they are just stuck in surroundings that insist what they do is the right thing. So I left it at sarcastically calling people who perpetuate the shit "very clever people", which didn't seem to offend many people.
[10:35:26] <hayley> But the author of BYOL? Yeah, fuck him, he made money off that book.
[10:37:11] <gilberth> Yes. And in general I have trouble to cope with this overly friendly hypocritical use language. This is quite common in Anglo-Saxon culture. Frankly, I prefer the way more direct and honest way we communicate here in North Germany. When something is a silly idea, I want to be able to say so.
[10:37:27] <hayley> gilberth: Hard to draw the line. I said that I sometimes reconsider my friendship with that one guy, as he runs a chatroom and mostly decides to blend in with the assholes in the room. Pretty Jucking Bad that some people there want me dead.
[10:37:44] * hayley not naming names of people who still might or might not want her dead here.
[10:38:51] <hayley> So it hits a bit differently when you get to be on the receiving end. That said, there's some bullshit too. Like how everyone has a "techbro" scapegoat and calls everyone they don't like such things, to avoid thinking.
[10:39:08] <gilberth> hayley: Yes, dear. But I don't need nor want a damn code of conduct. Some people are just assholes, they perhaps were born that way. I pity them.
[10:39:50] <hayley> $ echo "Be insuperable to each other" > CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md # who decided it should have underscores in the filename, anyway?
[10:40:35] <moon-child> I think structured governance can be useful in large congregations, but 'codes of conduct' are an overcorrection
[10:40:37] <gilberth> All I say is that this code of conduct thing is a blame instrument. And an instrument to blame a technical critique as harassment.
[10:41:59] * hayley wrote her first articles under a pseudonym to avoid getting piled on too much.
[10:43:02] <hayley> But worse, the pseudonym was perceived to be a straight guy, and thus people discarded anything I wrote. So I gave up on the idea.
[10:43:30] <gilberth> hayley: Yes, it says "Be insuperable to each other". Not "Be insuperable to each other independent of $list-of-random-feature-of-men."
[10:43:51] <hayley> Hence, I would not mind a code of conduct, but I am very wary of any "overcorrection", as moon-child calls it.

[10:53:54] <gilberth> What? Who says so?

[10:54:23] -ixelp- Why golang garbage-collector not implement Generational and Compact gc?
[10:54:43] <gilberth> Not even generational?
[10:55:17] * hayley back
[10:55:32] <gilberth> moon-child: Inhaled? Inhaled.
[10:55:44] <hayley> " In general it's likely to be more efficient to allocate memory using a set of per-thread caches, and at that point you've lost the advantages of a bump allocator" That is so not true.
[10:56:29] <hayley> "So in general, in Go, compared to other languages, a larger percentage of the quickly-unused values that a generational GC looks for are never allocated in GC memory in the first place." Yeah, no, "used in LIFO order" and "short lived" are not the same. And you only have static analysis.
[10:57:20] <hayley> For the former, you would have to consider cache misses and also the memory dependency of traversing a free list. Whereas a pointer bumping scheme only has a data dependency on a register.
[10:57:25] <gilberth> moon-child: The GC of Interlisp is hilarious. It's refcounting. The manual says there is no other GC and circular references will leak. There is a table of all objects with a refcount /= 1 and when it is full, you get a warning and gc is turned off until reboot.
[10:58:20] <hayley> See figure 1 of https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/speedway/DaCapo/papers/immix-pldi-2008.pdf for your own amusement, particuarly "Mutator time" and "Mutator L2 misses" as those are related to cache.
[10:58:32] <gilberth> hayley: They never learn.
[10:59:42] <hayley> gilberth: Okay, when I refer to "counter culture" I am usually referring to the queer people I see on the internet. (The club at high school was pretty tiny, and the participants were incredibly boring, hence why I go on the Internet.) They would rip you up.
[11:00:26] <gilberth> Me? Why? What's wrong with them?
[11:00:56] <hayley> Once someone was comparing CL to Standard ML, saying that the former butchered functional programming. Except that, well, it never tried to be a functional language, and the only really notable things in ML are types and inbuilt pattern matching. (And these days, I follow Bracha's advice that pattern matching generally tends to suck as it peers into data, rather than following object protocols.)
[11:01:48] <hayley> But the response I got was that I should shut up and not man-splain ML to them (btw I have also programmed non-negligible Standard ML and Haskell...), and when I said "ok, whatever" I was told I couldn't feel bad about it.
[11:02:19] <hayley> I could show you the screenshot, but I seriously find it disturbing.
[11:03:43] <hayley> And everything after that just felt alienating (no Lisp pun, it was bad). So I only really hang out in #lispcafe these days.

[11:13:15] <hayley> I probably did, but it is nothing serious. I didn't nearly die in a war, for example.

[11:24:36] <gilberth> And did I get that right, "they" sell us escape-analysis as a GC strategy?
[11:24:45] <hayley> Yes.
[11:25:18] <gilberth> Chocolate doesn't work here.
[11:25:43] <dave0> i like cold&flu medicine, it makes my hands and feets all soft and wooly like carpet
[11:25:50] <hayley> Though I do have some hope in opportunistic stack allocation, because 1. it is not static analysis and thus overly conservative, 2. it doesn't impose shit on your programming style and 3. you can decide to share a region between function calls, or break a call into loops/etc. Also you get to GC the stack.
[11:26:23] <gilberth> dave0: Those "medicine" often contains alcohol. That is doing that.
[11:26:53] <dave0> gilberth: it feels good
[11:27:24] <dave0> someone told me valium works on your brain the same way alcohol does
[11:27:41] <hayley> FWIW I don't think anyone has tested fragmentation over years, i.e. what CLOSOS would suffer.
[11:28:06] <gilberth> dave0: Hmm.
[11:28:12] <hayley> Or, at least what I hear from enterprise Java (mostly Gil Tene really) is that you only defer fragmentation without moving.
[11:28:59] <gilberth> hayley: idk. But yes, machines don't trash anymore these days, or at least way less. Try running X11 + Common Lisp + Emacs in 16MB.
[11:29:23] <hayley> As per https://shipilev.net/jvm/anatomy-quarks/11-moving-gc-locality/ moving GC also helps with cache.
[11:29:26] <moon-child> one data point: hard discs used to need 'defragmenting'.  Nowadays we don't need that because ssds provide uniform access times
[11:30:07] <hayley> SSDs also have cache still.
[11:30:15] * gilberth still has spinning disks.
[11:30:23] <moon-child> yeah.  But apparently it's uniform-enough that you don't need to move stuff around
[11:30:35] <hayley> And random reads seem to suck more than contiguous still, but I don't know why.
[11:30:43] <dave0> but is reading x consecutive blocks still faster than x scattered blocks?
[11:30:51] <moon-child> reads >1 block?
[11:31:03] <hayley> IIRC people test 4k blocks.

[11:31:21] <gilberth> moon-child: Yes, once you hit the SSD it doesn't make that much a difference as you don't need for the disk to be in the right position for the block you want.
[11:31:48] <hayley> https://serverfault.com/questions/843628/why-do-sequential-writes-have-better-performance-than-random-writes-on-ssds
[11:32:01] <hayley> Bollocks, Seagate says it's GC again.
[11:32:37] <gilberth> Still: A "disk" is slower than main memory, which is slower than Ln cache, which slower than L(n-1) cache, etc, which is slower than registers.
[11:34:09] <gilberth> And: We talk about latency, not bandwidth.
[11:38:16] <gilberth> hayley: Isn't optimistic stack allocate like having many, many generations?
[11:38:24] <hayley> Yes, Baker said that.
[11:39:29] <hayley> A super generational GC where there are no old->new pointers, so you can just kill stack regions. And if you need to GC, you can pick some arbitrary suffix of the stack to mark-compact on.

[19:07:25] <selwyn> it is popular in fitness communities

[19:07:43] <selwyn> as a way to get plenty of calories and protein, for people who struggle to eat enough
[19:07:54] <shka> uhm
[19:07:58] <selwyn> basically for bodybuilders
[19:08:14] <shka> well, not all people can even drink fresh milk
[19:08:23] <shka> because of genetics
[19:08:43] <selwyn> indeed
[19:09:16] <selwyn> though i think lactose intolerance must be overreported
[19:09:40] <shka> depends on the population
[19:10:04] <shka> in nutshell, milk drinkers are simply mutants
[19:10:11] <selwyn> i often see a figure of 70% for the middle east which i just can't believe
[19:10:18] <selwyn> dairy is everywhere
[19:10:27] <shka> i totally can believe it
[19:10:39] <shka> let me elaborate on that
[19:10:51] <amazigh> TIL
[19:11:33] <shka> selwyn: the indo-european population carries that mutation 
[19:12:30] <shka> and that's why they manage to spread to the Europe over the steps from the home  
[19:12:47] <shka> but during this migration era, middle east was already well settled 
[19:13:05] <shka> and could not be simply conquered 
[19:13:29] <shka> so, yeah, check your genetic privilege :P 
[19:13:32] <amazigh> that's where alien space race began
[19:13:37] <amazigh> oh sorry wrong chan
[19:14:08] <shka> amazigh: well there is genetic and linguistic proof of this migration
[19:14:19] <shka> and lactose tolerance is amazingly useful
[19:14:54] <shka> you can look it up
[19:14:58] <amazigh> yes. By the way I read, way before that human settled, they actually were migrations (even more slowly) and that other pre-humans merged together to form humanity
[19:15:26] <shka> well, that was during the stone age, so long before this 
[19:15:32] <amazigh> that is an alternative theory to the One True human ancestor
[19:15:41] <amazigh> yes
[19:16:00] <selwyn> stone age temple for the fermentation gods
[19:16:10] <amazigh> imagazighen like to remind they are a mix a various genetics.
[19:16:27] <amazigh> but who does not, lol.
[19:16:54] <shka> selwyn: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_migrations
[19:16:58] <amazigh> btw I have, I believe a cool story about imazighen
[19:17:21] <shka> and yes, milk ties into this :D
[19:17:26] <amazigh> tamazghit, the amazigh language, even if it has various dialects, is the only language I know that spread without a "central authority"
[19:18:11] <amazigh> AFAIK they were never a ruler that said "you now *must* tamazight" it grew "organically"
[19:18:34] <amazigh> Until recently there were no such thing as academia etc...
[19:18:48] <amazigh> I like to tell that story to inspire peace.
[19:19:13] <amazigh> Even if imazighen were not always peaceful... 
[19:19:23] <amazigh> another "peace amazigh" is the story of cartage
[19:19:47] <amazigh> before cartage settled in the nowadays tunisia, they were already amazigh people there, our calendar start -1000 BCE
[19:20:25] <amazigh> the story says cartage tricked imazighen with a leather of a cow or lion
[19:20:37] <amazigh> they made a thread with the leather, and its create the place known as cartage
[19:20:45] <amazigh> imazighen offered that leather for them.
[19:21:16] <amazigh> that's how cartage began
[19:21:35] <amazigh> Also, the fall of cartage is related to imazighen, because of a love affair ...
[19:22:09] <amazigh> when cartage wanted rome down, they asked help for imazighen (they would not be able go from tunisia to rom with elephant without going through tamazgha)
[19:22:11] <amazigh> by foot
[19:22:36] <amazigh> so they agreed to take rome down. but for some reason, imazighen changed their mind, and helped rome take cartage down.
[19:22:47] <amazigh> so cartage lost.
[19:23:34] <amazigh> I guess there is many other stories...
[19:25:07] <amazigh> at the time of cartage, according to the story there is a famous ruler, but I wonder how language remained shared through all this time.. I mean, without schools and stuff..
[19:25:41] <amazigh> IME, i went to morocco two days I understood nothing of their language :P
[19:25:50] <pjb> amazigh: communications were fast enough, thanks to the roman roads, and horse relays.
[19:26:26] <amazigh> yes, maybe, but tamazgha words appears further south in the sahara desert
[19:27:07] <amazigh> well, people say morocco dialect's alphabet comes from the desert (called tifinag)
[19:27:36] <pjb> amazigh: when you consider that French can understand Spanish and vice-versa (mostly) even today, I would assume they had no problem keeping consistency of the language. At least, that's not the cause of the fall of Rome.
[19:27:40] <amazigh> which was the only alphabet until 1960
[19:27:52] <selwyn> a very pretty alphabet it is
[19:27:52] <amazigh> true

[22:08:56] <pjb>  
[22:08:56] <pjb>  
[22:09:11] <gilberth> Is it the whole EUR-zone?
[22:09:21] <ck_> I wanted those newlines last week, pjb
[22:09:43] <selwyn>  
[22:09:52] <ck_>  
[22:10:04] * gilberth was wondering, if that is black text on black background.
[22:10:34] <pjb> No, it's just some newlines that accumulate at the end of the erc buffer…
[22:11:04] <pjb> gilberth: money printing is performed by the central banks of the USD, EUR, and JPY in a massive way.
[22:11:28] <ln43> but why?
[22:11:30] <pjb> gilberth: they use the money mostly to buy state bonds and company shares.
[22:11:51] <pjb> because central bankers are idiots.
[22:11:57] <gilberth> Yep, and this is why real estate prices are that insanely high.
[22:12:02] <pjb> exactly.
[22:12:08] <selwyn> what do you think of mmt
[22:12:23] <ln43> and nothing, money should be no more physical and that is the reason why bank today is mostly a softbank rather than before
[22:12:56] <pjb> The people who benefit are those who are close to the central banks, Ie the banksters, and the rich people, who then can by houses and building in cosmopolitan cities, out-pricing people out of them.
[22:14:03] <ln43> yes and there is too much difference between very reach people and the others
[22:14:04] <gilberth> You may call that neo-feudalism.
[22:14:08] <ln43> *richs
[22:14:41] <gilberth> ln43: Curious, why do you want a still larger difference between those classes then?
[22:15:10] <ln43> why me? i don't want it
[22:15:40] <ln43> i prefer the opposite... small differences if any otherwise no difference at all is better
[22:15:56] <gilberth> You said "money should be no more physical". Abolishing the gold standard and allowing banks to print their own money is the root of the cause. IHMO.
[22:16:51] <gilberth> I mean, when you pop up at a bank ask for a loan, they lend you money, which they just invent. It didn't exist before.
[22:16:56] <pjb> The answer to that is the theory of relativity of money.
[22:17:23] <pjb> http://vit.free.fr/TRM/en_US/
[22:17:24] -ixelp- Table of Contents — ThÃ©orie Relative de la Monnaie v2.718
[22:18:16] <gilberth> Thus banks get interest on thin air. And when you can't pay the mortgage, banks have the house and you are bankrupt.
[22:18:21] <pjb> The point is to have exactly as much money as there is wealth (plus a little more to ease exchanges).
[22:18:55] <pjb> gilberth: sure. but note how happy the banks can be with all those houses they can't sell to anybody, since everybody is bankrupt! :-)
[22:19:18] <gilberth> pjb: We're not there yet.
[22:20:04] <pjb> Well, there's already an implementation: https://monnaie-libre.fr
[22:20:11] <gilberth> It sucks^Wis unfortunate however that this is bad timing for me. I would want a house now, not in a decade, when I'm old.
[22:20:38] <pjb> https://cesium.app/en/
[22:20:56] <pjb> Sure, there's some transitionning…
[22:21:51] <gilberth> It's particular bad in Germany here. People buy houses on just like 1.2% interest rate and only 1% down each year. When those contracts are due and interest would be like say 6% as it used to be, they simply can't effort the mortgage anymore and have only paid for like 20% (less because of taxes) of the house off.
[22:22:22] <gilberth> So when interest rate will raise to a normal level again, we get a huge real estate crisis here.
[22:22:52] <ck_> becoming alive is a mistake you can't even avoid. I'm writing to my local religion representative right now
[22:23:00] <gilberth> I'll be patient. Houses will be cheap by then.
[22:23:16] <pjb> gilberth: oh, but the housing situation will become better, for the survivors.
[22:23:26] <gilberth> ck_: You want a refund?
[22:23:30] <ln43> the big problems here are corporatism ad privileges and tax havens and low cost of labor in other places and liquid society and climate changes 
[22:23:35] <pjb> gilberth: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones
[22:24:03] <gilberth> pjb: Yes, as I said, I'll be patient. I could perhaps effort a nice large house in a decade or so for a bargain.
[22:24:24] <ln43> yes i will wait for a reduction of costs before doing next investments
[22:24:28] <ln43> of course
[22:24:45] <ck_> gilberth: what are you offering
[22:24:56] <pjb> gilberth: the energy requirement for 8 billion people without CO2, (if you assume it's really a problem), would mean that we'd have to build 180,000 1GW nuclear power plants worldwide.  It's too late, we knew it in the 60s, we didn't do it in the 70s.  The choice has been made for this target population, which corresponds to the 5% of nuclear energy we have currently
[22:25:13] <gilberth> ck_: Me offering? To wohm?
[22:25:17] <selwyn> recently i came into some money from $rich_relative
[22:25:24] <selwyn> unsure whether to pay off the student loans or not
[22:25:29] <ck_> gilberth: me wanting? Form hwom?
[22:25:35] <pjb> gilberth: the mortality rate of the covid and the "vaxxine" side effects are such that you can estimate that they planned the reduction of population over 40 years, so between 2020 and 2060.
[22:25:36] <White_Flame> pjb: is that assuming 8 billion first-world lifestyle people?
[22:25:41] <selwyn> this fucking government imposes early repayment penalties
[22:25:49] <ck_> selwyn: what the fuck.
[22:26:05] <selwyn> we are meant to be good paypigs for our whole lives
[22:26:05] <ck_> that's the most advanced regulatory bullshittery I've ever heard
[22:26:06] <pjb> So if you can survive the first few years, there will be enough dead, that housing will become cheap.
[22:26:10] <White_Flame> don't governments tend to _incentivize_ home ownership?
[22:26:16] <ln43> yes right
[22:26:18] <White_Flame> as in tax breaks for homeowners and such?
[22:26:35] <pjb> White_Flame: indeed. Note that the demographic projections estimate the population will stabilize around 11 billion around 2050.
[22:27:03] <ln43> and reduction of taxes
[22:27:27] <pjb> but if we stop using carbon energy sources, and if we don't replace them by nuclear energy (fusion or fission) we won't be able to feed 11 billion. So they'll just die from food scarcity.

[22:28:39] <ck_> "fusion is always N years away", no?
[22:29:02] <pjb> selwyn: some startups are making some progress, but it'll probably happen too late anyways, to avoid depopulation.

[22:29:34] <sham1> ck_: where N is 15, yes
[22:29:54] <ck_> great, I can't wait
[22:30:39] <ln43> and than there is the state that is blaming who is asking for financial help in this critical situation (covid / reduction / production externalization etc.)
[22:30:46] <pjb> even if we had overunity fusion tomorrow, the problem is this 95% of energy needs that must be covered buy the new energy source.
[22:31:02] <pjb> remember, 180000 1GW nuclear power plants.
[22:31:09] <ln43> but the social purpose of the state is to help the citizens i suppose, not only ask for taxes
[22:31:54] <pjb> If a fusion reactor is 10 times more powerful, say 10 GW, you would still need to educate the engineers, to staff the companies to produce the materials needed to build 18,000 10 GW fusion power plants world wide!
[22:32:00] <pjb> This is not something you do in 15 years.
[22:32:18] <ln43> and then all the critical services are coming from the outside
[22:32:34] <ln43> it's not a wise behavior, sorry
[22:34:06] <ln43> so yes, we should start investing more in the nuclear maybe... there are no many other possibilities
[22:34:32] <pjb> This is not something that decolonized countries can do, they decolonized before their civilizing and universities were done.  This is not something that Europeans can do anymore, with the demographic and immigration problems that made the education system drop the ball hard.  Nowadays the problem are not even the children, but the teachers who are idiots.  You'll need at least 2 generations before recovering the human techno-scientific
[22:34:32] <pjb> capability we had in the 60s.

[22:34:58] -ixelp- Richmond Park Deer - YouTube
[22:35:55] <ln43> but maybe yes, the idea is t reduce the amount of people all around the world...
[22:36:01] <pjb> So you can just prepare yourself for way higher mortality rate, whatever the reason (random injections, famine, biological wars, pollution, etc).
[22:36:12] <pjb> This will be the theme for the next 40 years. 
[22:36:20] <ln43> not only biological i suppose
[22:36:28] <ln43> we'll see
[22:36:41] <pjb> You could invest in funeral companies. 
[22:37:03] <pjb> ln43: well, the survivors will like to have a unpolluted, unradiated planet left.
[22:37:16] <ln43> now there is a situoation more dangerous than the could war for sure
[22:37:17] <pjb> I assume neutron bombs would do.
[22:37:49] <pjb> But the problem of war and bombs, is that there's destruction, and a lot of dead at once, which causes intendance problems. 
[22:38:13] <pjb> It's better to use controlled injections so that you can adjust the death rate to the capacity of handling the bodies.
[22:38:49] <pjb> Hence a sigmoid spread over 40 years with the parameters we observe currently.  This makes the death rate in the worst years (around 2040) still manageable.
[22:39:08] <pjb> (and foremost, with a population in 20 years that is psychologically prepared to such death rates).
[22:40:22] <pjb> I'm not saying that's the future I wanted to live in, (I'll probably be dead by then anyways), and I also estimate like Elon Musk that 500 million people are not enough to make a technological civilization able to go to the stars.
[22:40:39] <ln43> i don't think than immigration is a problem but only one effect of a series of problems
[22:41:01] <ln43> the same for this technological dominancy demand
[22:41:05] <pjb> It would have been better if we had developped nuclear, and space solar, over the last 60 years, so that we could sustain the 11 billion people needed to start a stellar civilization.
[22:42:32] <pjb> But instead of promoting that, our goverment choose to put us on unemployment, to destroy the education system, the economy, and to avoid carefully any optimistic outlook and voluntary space exploration and exploitation.
[22:42:33] <ln43> yes true... but to explore the space we can't destroy the earth
[22:42:42] <selwyn> i don't think its given that a stellar civilisation is possible
[22:42:47] <pjb> To explore the space would have saved earth!
[22:42:48] <ln43> without being sure of the results 
[22:42:53] <pjb> There's nothing to pollute in space!
[22:43:14] <selwyn> i don't think people can thrive in any sense away from their home planet
[22:43:45] <pjb> We'll see, once Elon can send people to Mars.
[22:43:57] <ln43> you see... one big asteroid could be a problem for a planet so now can we defend our planet from  asteroids?
[22:44:08] <pjb> ln43: fat chance.
[22:44:24] <pjb> notably, one problem with asteroids, is that we don't see half of them.
[22:44:33] <ln43> xd
[22:44:39] <ln43> why not?
[22:44:51] <pjb> A couple of years ago, one asteroid passed by 3 moon-earth distance, we learned about it only weeks before perigee!
[22:45:17] <pjb> Well, for one thing we don't have an array of radar observing the whole space.
[22:45:27] <ln43> ok ok...
[22:46:19] <pjb> Another thing is that beside solar system asteroids who could arrive at a reasonable speed, there could be intersideral bodies (such as the Oumuamua) that could arrive way faster.
[22:46:45] <pjb> And having an array of radar all around could attract evil ET, so it's not necessarily a good idea either.
[22:48:51] <ln43> interesting that interstellar body
[22:50:02] <Alfr> pjb, why 180000 GW?
[22:50:31] <pjb> I mean, when I see how many programmers are needed to develop stuff like the hand-held computers (iPhone, Android, etc), imagine the number of programmers needed to program all the stuff that will be required in space, be it robotic, or for humans.
[22:50:42] <pjb> Alfr: that's the energy used by humanity each year.
[22:51:40] <pjb> https://ourworldindata.org/energy-mix currently, 160,000 TWh/year
[22:52:52] <pjb> Alfr: we'd have to multiply that by 11/7.5 and by some factor because we keep using more and more energy (having access to more and more machines). Notably this doesn't take into account the fact that third world countries don't use as much energy yet.
[22:53:05] <pjb> So in 2050, we could need actually the double at least.
[22:53:47] <Alfr> pjb, ah okay, that's where you get your factor of about 14, I'm missing in my calculation.
[22:53:57] <pjb> But even without those considerations, you realize we don't have the means (time and human resources) to build those nuclear power plants, so don't count on anything else, because nuclear energy is the most concentrated we have!
[22:54:17] <Alfr> pjb, admittedly, it'll certainly increase, but by that much?
[22:54:21] <pjb> We could possibly replace it by space solar, but we have even less resources to industrialize space at the required scale.

[23:00:17] <Alfr> pjb, say it triples and then double that that for increased population etc.; but that'd only be a factor of 6.
[23:01:10] <pjb> No, you have to go from 6% to 94%  (/ 0.94 0.06) #| --> 15.666667 |# 
[23:03:10] <Alfr> pjb, 160000 TWh/a = 160 PWh/a = 160 / 365 / 24 PW that's about 18.2 TW output on average (currently).
[23:03:26] <pjb> (* 0.06 160000) #| --> 9600.0 |#  TWh currently from nuclear.  Today we'd need about 150400 TWh from nuclear to replace CO2.  But you must also take into account that switching electricity for everything will probably increase the loses (efficiency, transport loses, transformation loses etc). So you need to multiply by a factor here too.
[23:04:39] <pjb> Yes, 18,000 1GW nuclear power plants  today.
[23:05:01] <Alfr> pjb, but those 160000 is all power we currently use now, including for heating etc.
[23:05:21] <pjb> Yes. All that needs to be replaced by nuclear to avoid CO2.
[23:05:42] <White_Flame> will we no longer have lumber, or solar heating, etc for things that suck a lot of electrons for heat?
[23:05:55] <pjb> Notably, CO2 production is 1/4 cement production. So we'll have to have a new process to make cement that doesn't produce CO2, and this is bound to cost more energy.
[23:06:22] <pjb> White_Flame: it's a matter of scale.
[23:06:39] <pjb> you can use lumber for heating when you're 200,000,000, not when you're 11 billions.
[23:07:04] <Alfr> pjb, okay. All is well, you initially wrote 180,000 GW (note the additional 0), that's what stumped me.
[23:07:41] <pjb> Alfr: yes, I might have added a 0 from memory.  But since we'll have those factors to multiply by for the transformation, we won't be far from an order of magnitude anyways.
[23:08:43] <pjb> For example, if we don't have enough lithium for all the car batteries, we'll have to synthesize artificial gas for cars and planes.  This could easily means double or triple the energy (which we would waste on that, to avoid CO2 production).
[23:09:32] <Alfr> pjb, but building, say, 36k 1GW nuclear power plants is only a fifth that work than making 180k of those.
[23:10:32] <pjb> Another big part is the oil used to make fertilizers, but here, in addition to energy, it's also used for the chemistry.
[23:10:45] <shka> well, you don't need to go 100% nuclear
[23:10:49] <ln43> ok but it's anyways a lot of work even if there are 10 years at disposal...
[23:10:50] <ln43> or 20 / 30
[23:11:31] <pjb> So if we don't have oil anymore, we'll have to spend energy to source the chemical elements needed, in addition to the processing energy.  Again, we're bound to have to spend 2 or more time the energy to keep producing food for the 11 billion.
[23:11:47] <pjb> shka: it's either 100% nuclear, or solar panels in space.
[23:11:50] <Alfr> pjb, we don't need to go to zero CO2 emissions, that simply won't be possible.
[23:12:07] <shka> pjb: well, you could have nuclear + solar

[23:12:56] <pjb> shka: but the point is that for either solution, we'd have had to start developping them 60 years ago, ie, starting to educate the require ingeneers world wide! then started to  explore space and to build nuclear power plants to have the 18k we'd need today.
[23:13:15] <Alfr> shka, power alone won't solve storage for mobility.
[23:13:35] <shka> Alfr: that it is a different problem
[23:13:48] <pjb> We didn't do that, so we won't be able to keep the people. We'll stop using oil, be it for CO2 or for peak oil, and this means that we won't be able to feed the people we're feeding today. We'll have to fall back to the population 200 years ago if only for this reason.
[23:14:10] <shka> problem that i don't know how to address honestly
[23:14:45] <ck_> White_Flame: from plastics?
[23:14:53] <pjb> And as mentionned at the start, the plan is to target 500,000,000 people, which correspond to the current nuclear power plant park world wide, and to the death rates we observe in the COVID crisis for a reasonable depopulation sigmoid over 40 years.
[23:15:18] <White_Flame> ck_: it's a theory that crude oil isn't a "fossil fuel", but rather a fairly recent bacterial output
[23:15:32] <pjb> Alfr: well, lithium there's enough of it in space.  SpaceX will be Li provider for Tesla eventually.
[23:15:55] <pjb> White_Flame: indeed.  Time scales are wrong.  But that's beside the point.
[23:16:00] <shka> most of the lithium in in the sea water
[23:16:07] <shka> same for uranium actually
[23:16:25] <White_Flame> lots of gold in them thar waves as well
[23:16:38] <pjb> shka: which would cost a lot of energy to gather, unless we're able to create genetically organisms to go eat it and concentrate it for us. 
[23:17:01] <pjb> But the geneticians have made the choice to make ARNm to kill people intead. It's more profitable and easier.
[23:17:07] <shka> likely still cheaper then space mining
[23:17:10] <Alfr> pjb, if we get storing hydrogen solved, fuel cells could provide an alternative to Li batteries.
[23:17:37] <pjb> Alfr: well, hydrogen is hard to store, indeed.  It's easier to synthesize gas.
[23:18:15] <pjb> There's too much C in atmosphere (in CO2), so let's just use it, produce CH4 for our cars and rockets :-)
[23:18:24] <Alfr> pjb, gas takes up too large a volume to put in a car and drive around with it.
[23:18:35] <sham1> Liquid CO2
[23:18:42] <sham1> Or liquid CH4
[23:19:02] <gilberth> Alfr: gasoline is liquid.
[23:19:46] <gilberth> We need something to power our air planes, anyway.
[23:19:47] <pjb> Anyways, this means that you have to plan for a world where the population will decrease a lot over the next 40 years, and this means that there will be a lot of resources in recyclying old stuff.  Housing will be afordable: just take over houses of dead people. 
[23:19:47] <Alfr> pjb, I meant hydrogen as a gas.
[23:20:24] <gilberth> IMHO We won't get anywhere with hydrogen.
[23:20:34] <sham1> Unless we do fusion
[23:21:42] <Alfr> pjb, not sure how efficiently we can pull CO2 out of the air for that purpose; it's only about 0.0004 of air is CO2.
[23:21:53] <gilberth> It's just too damn hard to store. Why not synthesise gasoline instead. We could keep our current cars and infrastructure, too. And it works with air planes just fine.
[23:22:00] <pjb> sham1: no, the problem is the same with fusion.  Even if it's 10 or 100 times more concentrated than fission nuclear energy, we don't have the human resources (not enough intelligent humans) and the time, to build the fusion power plants.  It's just too late.
[23:22:08] <ln43> or use liquid metallic hydrogen as an alternative
[23:22:24] <ln43> emulate what happens inside the stars and replicate for cars...
[23:22:56] <gilberth> ln43: Sure, works terrific at room temperature and normal pressure.
[23:23:17] <Alfr> gilberth, harder to make than methane and lighter C-H stuff.
[23:23:46] <gilberth> Alfr: Yes, but way easier to store and transport.
[23:25:00] <ln43> ok... but only 400GPa should be required
[23:25:25] <ln43> 3,900,000 atm; 58,000,000 psi
[23:26:09] <gilberth> ln43: When this is "only", why don't you construct a car running from that and get rich?
[23:27:31] <ln43> ok but there is the safety factor to consider
[23:27:39] <gilberth> How massive must the fuel tank be? And what would be needed to keep the hydrogen from diffusing out? Magnetic confinement?
[23:28:29] <pjb> gilberth: well, H is not magnetic, and is electrically neutral, so there's no magnetic confinement to be had here.
[23:28:51] <pjb> gilberth:  what works for H, is gravitational confinment.  As in stars.
[23:28:55] <ln43> i suppose 40 liters should be enough and then ok, make a tank enough robust to not break after impacts...
[23:29:17] <gilberth> pjb: Yes, I am aware.
[23:30:02] <pjb> Now, we could consider some radical discovery.
[23:30:44] <gilberth> ln43: What is the force per area at 400GPa? What material could sustain that? And how would you build up that pressure in the first place?
[23:31:16] <gilberth> pjb: Ok then, I propose an anti-dark-matter engine.
[23:31:29] <pjb> If Apple could build into their iPhone a Thorium-based personal energy source, that would power  not only the iPhone for life, but also your house, all your compturs and your car.  That you would hook your iPhone in the plane, not to take energy, but to give energy to the plane! and build 8 billions of such devices.  Then yes, that'd be some radical discovery that would help
[23:32:45] <pjb> Another radical discovery would be AI.  This wouldn't really help about depopulation, unless it's able to further make radical discoveries.  But it could help to maintain a technological society with only 500,000,000 people (or with only 1,000,000 people on Mars, as Elon is betting), to go on to a stellar civilisation.
[23:32:53] <gilberth> pjb: Won't happen in my country, because it's evil nuclear energy. But, yes, I always wondered how small a nuclear reactor could actually be.
[23:33:00] <Alfr> gilberth, but harder to make, as I said. As the whole point of this exercise is to avoid putting more C(O2) into the atmosphere, you'd have to source that from the atmosphere itself.
[23:33:19] <pjb> But I'm not too optimisitic on the radicality of AI. it'll probably be slow to make any progress, like fusion.
[23:35:29] <pjb> There's probably way to get some radical changes of the situation from space exploration and exploitation.  As mentionned, if we find an asteroid made of lithium, or some other resource we can put to good use in space or in Earth, this could help, and it could be fast enough (less than 10 years, given SpaceX).
[23:35:58] <pjb> But again, we don't see the government investing massively into that kind of stuff.
[23:35:59] <gilberth> Alfr: Well, I would appreciate when we would stop burning coal to begin with. I said that some 30 years ago. Instead nuclear power was deemed evil. And, yes, I blame the "Green" movement for burning coal and thus putting massive amounts of CO_2 into the atmosphere. Hypocritical to now wanting to reduce that.
[23:36:12] <pjb> They prefer to confine us, instead of motivating us on a space program.
[23:36:55] <Alfr> pjb, wait what? But you can't buy a new phone every year or two. That's be unacceptable for Apple.
[23:36:59] <pjb> gilberth: when I reached 18 yo, I decided not to buy an ICE car, until EV cars would be available.  Now I don't have enough money to buy a Tesla, but that'd be the idea.
[23:37:04] <Alfr> s/That's/That'd/
[23:37:11] <pjb> Alfr: well, some things will have to change :-)
[23:37:26] <ln43> ok using a diamond anvil cell (DAC) it should be possible
[23:37:39] <ln43> or something similar... maybe
[23:37:42] <gilberth> pjb: There is no "they", only stupid people.
[23:38:01] <pjb> yes.  This is indeed, a big part of the question.
[23:38:17] <ln43> but tesla is not a good car
[23:38:27] <gilberth> pjb: EV cars were available much earlier, especially in France.
[23:38:41] <gilberth> I consider EV cars to be a red herring of sorts.
[23:38:45] <pjb> We've seen how google dried up the engineers and programmers for a few years, when they started hiring a lot of the smartest people.  The other companies had difficulting finding good people.
[23:38:48] <Alfr> gilberth, I think you're preaching to the choir here.
[23:39:24] <gilberth> Where do the rare earths come from? How long must an EV be driven until you break even CO_2 wise.
[23:39:25] <pjb> Similarly, when Elon will start to send 1,000,000 to Mars, it'll have to be the smartest, and that will be one million fewer for Earth.
[23:39:52] <gilberth> Alfr: Yes, perhaps here. In real life, I am politically incorrect.
[23:39:56] <pjb> You felt the effect of 300,000 hires at google, imagine the effect of 1 millions of people sent to Mars.
[23:40:29] <pjb> (I'm quite optimistic for the Martian colony, if they can grow to 100 millions at least and become self-sustaining).
[23:42:12] <pjb> But as mentionned, I'm not sure it'll be enough.  If you can live off a planet, then 30,000 people would be largely enough to bring a good genetic pool for long term survival.  But in space where you have to make your own biosphere with technology and intelligence, and build everything from scratch, 100,000,000 people might not be enough, even with AIs and robots.
[23:43:03] *** Quits: ln43 (~ln43@user/ln43) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[23:45:27] <Alfr> gilberth, doesn't change the fact that we're very dependent on our neighbours being in a good mood every morning, intermediately that some transit country dosen't cut off our gas supply, and in the long term that we're in relatively good standing with the Kremlin.
[23:47:31] <gilberth> Alfr: Yes, this is the outcome of shutting down both coal and nuclear. We'll need to import energy on a massive scale. Thus we outsource the problem and could call ourselfs CO_2 neutral on paper.
[23:52:01] <moon-child> I thought germany was just shutting down nuclear and doubling down on coal?
[23:52:34] <Alfr> moon-child, nah. We're stupid, we're doing BOTH!
[23:52:46] <gilberth> Nuclear will be shutdown by next year or so. And coal by 2030 it seems.
[23:53:07] <moon-child> :/
[23:55:29] <gilberth> There are wind turbines in the north not even connected to the power grid, still electricity is ten times as expensive as gas due to taxes. So politics prefers that I heat my house with Russian gas instead of with CO_2 neutral wind power. I just cannot effort the latter.
[23:57:31] <kuao> https://thenewstack.io/which-programming-languages-use-the-least-electricity/
[23:57:33] -ixelp- Which Programming Languages Use the Least Electricity? – The New Stack
[23:58:07] <gilberth> Heating houses is one major part of the CO_2 budget. Heating with electricity would make a lot of sense, when you use one of those storage-ovens (which are forbidden by law). Those ovens would store heat in stones essentially. Acting as a battery they could store heat, when there is a surplus of electricity.
[23:59:18] <moon-child> 'forbidden by law'  why?
[23:59:57] <gilberth> moon-child: Because you should not heat with electricity. It's evil.
