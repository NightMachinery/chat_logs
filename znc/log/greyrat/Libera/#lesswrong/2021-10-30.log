[02:43:12] <kuudes> butt why no windows?
[02:44:38] <adiabatic> it's built like a cruise ship. lots of totally internal rooms
[02:45:51] <kuudes> isn't that a fire hazard?
[02:46:29] <adiabatic> no idea. I would have figured that 'all the air you get is centrally circulated' would be a thoroughly discredited meme
[02:46:43] <kuudes> no, I mean windows are exits
[02:46:49] <adiabatic> that too
[02:47:04] <adiabatic> my bet is that it won't pass some kind of fire inspection
[02:49:28] <kuudes> also people need some amount of outside light to function
[02:49:48] <kuudes> but indeed if such is allowed, why not make -5 floor basements with same structure
[02:50:06] <adiabatic> basements? in earthquake country?
[02:50:16] <adiabatic> basements are positively _foreign_ here.
[02:50:27] <kuudes> if you don't need fire exits, who cares of earthquake deaths either
[02:51:28] <kuudes> over here the stairways are not fire exits, as they will likely fill with smoke. so each apartment needs to have a balcony which is outside where you evacuate to
[02:51:38] <kuudes> the fire brigade will then pick you out from there
[02:52:43] <kuudes> if there is lethal smoke, you will get likely killed from third floor running down stairs, some people will die from second floor as well
[02:53:06] <kuudes> basicly in a fire you should not go to indoor stairways unless there are no other alternatives
[02:53:47] <adiabatic> yeah, we've got an unstoppable force (Munger's wishes) vs. an immovable object (obvious fire and air safety concerns)
[02:53:52] <kuudes> people have died evacuating through stairways even when there was just a minor fire which was put out easily by the fire brigade. if they had stayed in their apartment they had survived
[02:53:57] <kuudes> indeed
[02:53:57] * adiabatic passes the popcorn bucket to kuudes
[02:54:19] <kuudes> still, personally I would sometimes like a room without windows - it would get properly dark
[02:54:46] <kuudes> but yeah, cruise ships are deathtraps...
[02:55:42] <kuudes> if at any time there is a blackout or alarm on cruise ship, go immediately outside on the deck and wait there until you understand what happened and why it is actually safe to return

[03:37:46] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Here we pass into the realm of educated guesses and probability as classification comes into play. Based on the available evidence, we can reasonably conclude that the Ripple concept is nothing less than the direct application of nascent inertial confinement fusion technology to full-scale thermonuclear explosive design, the key features being a high-gain pusherless
[03:37:46] <feepbot> spherical secondary of thin, hollow-shell design imploded by a temporally shaped, highly optimized X-ray pulse from a compact, highly efficient fission primary. The optimized pulse would also enable hot-spot ignition of a centrally located container of DT gas, acting in precisely the same fashion as a fission spark plug but without the weight. In short, the Ripple concept is
[03:37:46] <feepbot> essentially a nuclear-driven, scaled-up, high-gain ICF fusion explosion. The key to making the Ripple concept work is the highly secret and extremely complex pulse-shaping mechanism that transforms the single, strong X-ray burst from the primary into a series of precisely timed shocks (the pusherless secondary would also contribute to efficiency by drastically reducing device
[03:37:51] <feepbot> weight).' hm

[03:50:47] <feepbot> fusion device. The yield-to-weight ratio would be more than twice that of the most efficient high-yield weapon constructed, Livermore‚Äôs own three-stage B-41 bomb. The B-41 had a device weight of 9,300 pounds and a maximum (untested) ‚Äúconventional‚Äù yield of 25 megatons, giving a yield-to-weight ratio of close to 6 kt/kg.72 More than twice this ratio, or approximately 12 to 15

[03:51:17] <gwern> I never quite understood why the national labs were so obsessed with laser inertial containment fusion. how was that connected to bomb physics other than in vague basic physics ways? this explains it: the next leap in h-bombs removed the fission tamper almost entirely, using shaped x-ray pulses from a tiny trigger. every time you blast a fusion pellet with an array of lasers, you're...

[04:00:15] <catern> just reading the tsar bomba wp article, stumbled across this sentence: "As an expression of the concept of nuclear deterrence adopted during the leadership of Georgy Malenkov and Nikita Khrushchev, the actual strategic situation in consideration to this concept, for the Soviet Union, as a consequence of the disequilibrium with regards to the Soviet Union vis-√†-vis America's nuclear weapons possessions, to the favour of the latter, w

[04:00:25] <gwern> it also makes SDI that much more plausible: if you can shape x-ray pulses precisely enough to detonate h-bombs, that makes the whole x-ray laser anti-missile usecase more plausible

[04:01:32] <catern> this is some kind of 80s international relations game theory nonsense

[04:04:35] <catern> yeah that
[04:07:58] <quanticle> "An additional factor weighed against the weaponization of the Ripple concept for reentry vehicle purposes; namely, size. Despite being unusually lightweight, the Ripple concept required a particularly large volume relative to standard Teller-Ulam designs. The only ICBM in the inventory dimensionally large enough to carry a Ripple-based design was the Titan II, and even though this class of
[04:07:59] <quanticle> launch vehicle was relatively new, it was already being phased out in favor of smaller missiles such as the Minuteman. This shift, coupled with a strategy that sought to minimize warhead size in order to maximize numbers, also played a role in the decision to halt development."

[05:17:51] <pompolic> no, that's not the right way to put it -- it's as if around 2012, if someone put importance signifiers into text directly, everyone else just dutifully adjusted their own "importance" rating

[07:01:45] <Robomot> New York Restaurants I Love: Breakfast - LessWrong 2.0 viewer [Said Achmiz 15 Feb 2019 7:35 UTC 2 pointsExcellent post ‚Ä¶] (Previously (and more generally useful):¬†Restaurant Guide 1: Restaurants should not look like (most) restaurants,¬†Restaurant Guide 2: Pizza Also:¬†Minimize Use of Standard Internet Food Delivery I don‚Äôt want to lose sight of the bigger issues pointed at last time. ‚Ä¶)
[07:03:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Terrible. My intended "Black & White Cookies of Gravesend" post was aborted in its infancy when I found exactly one (1) bakery in the whole neighborhood that had B&Ws, and they turned out to be borderline-inedible (they also sell black & white cookie styled *pound cake*, for some incomprehensible reason, but after trying their cookie, I'm not even bothering with the weird variant)
[07:03:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: And other neighborhoods are even worse
[07:03:41] <gwern> violence to bodies
[07:04:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Given that even some of the bakeries I reviewed in those posts have since closed (to no one's surprise) or dropped in quality (ditto), I've come to the conclusion that if I want a proper B&W, I'll have to bake one myself...
[07:05:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... except that I am not sure I can bring myself to spend the effort on developing a proper recipe, given that a B&W cookie is so sweet that it's really not a good idea to bake a long series of them and eat the results - so am I just going to discard them until I get it exactly right? Sounds horribly wasteful and ... probably not worth it
[07:06:07] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: But haven't you heard? Progress is real! Things are constantly improving! I'm sure that if adjust for inflation, you'll find that today's black and white cookies are actually *better* than the ones you were getting a few years ago
[07:06:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> :\
[07:06:40] <quanticle> AllAmericanBreakfast wrote a thousand words about it on less wrong dot com, it can't be false!
[07:06:42] * gwern admires the self-restraint of not following up on the Black and white line of satire and instead going for inflation
[07:07:10] <quanticle> gwern: That would have been too easy
[07:08:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> My other idea was to construct a sort of reimagining of the B&W cookie that isn't so sugary, kind of like some of the entries in the Dessert Bible where Chris Kimball is like "ok, so the canonical way of making <some type of cookie or something> is thus-and-such, but honestly? it sucks and is bad and should feel bad. let's instead do it in this different way, which is good instead of bad"

[11:05:06] *** Joins: CryptoDavid (uid14990@id-14990.uxbridge.irccloud.com)
[11:17:36] <quanticle> I don't think the containers are interchangeable even when empty. Containers are owned by different shipping companies. If you need to get Evergreen's containers, then having to move a thousand Maersk, K-Line, etc, containers out of the way is going to be annoying.
[11:17:59] <Gurkenglas> That sounds like a costless change, then. Force them to be fungible.
[11:18:07] <quanticle> It's not costless.
[11:18:12] <quanticle> Why would it be costless?
[11:18:26] <Gurkenglas> Is the cost that the companies would be less incentivized to not damage their containers?
[11:19:49] <quanticle> Not damage, or hoard for other purposes.
[11:20:27] <nshepperd> if it was costless the shipping companies would have already arranged to pay each other for whichever containers are available
[11:20:29] <quanticle> But more to the point, these containers were all manufactured by the various shipping companies, and while the cost of each individual container is probably pretty low, in aggregate, you're looking millions of dollars.
[11:20:33] <quanticle> That's not nothing.
[11:21:23] <Gurkenglas> They are only standardized on the outside?
[11:22:49] <quanticle> Just because something is built to a standard spec (and therefore fungible) doesn't mean it's zero-cost, or that it shouldn't have ownership assigned.
[11:23:44] <Gurkenglas> By zero-cost I meant that it's only about abstractions such as property, and doesn't require, like, construction of a new kind of crane.
[11:24:46] <Gurkenglas> (but yes I did also imply no distortions created by the change, so the "no-damage"/"hoard" part is relevant)
[11:27:20] <Gurkenglas> Okay, suppose we can't arrange them to buy and sell their standardized containers to each other. Many of these contaienrs have the same label. Could they sort them by label, and then there's no need for roads within same-label regions?
[11:28:18] <quanticle> They could, but that would be a lot of work.
[11:28:36] <quanticle> You'd have to reshuffle all those containers and store them by owner.
[11:28:37] <Gurkenglas> The cranes are currently sitting idle, that's ~the problem.
[11:28:52] <quanticle> Uh, the cranes can't reach the containers you're talking about.
[11:28:59] <quanticle> Those containers are moved by forklift
[11:29:03] <quanticle> Which is what the roads are for
[11:29:19] <Gurkenglas> I... expect the forklifts are also idle? The U-shaped frames that go up and down the rows in the video.
[11:29:44] <Gurkenglas> Which they would be, if there's an empty container pileup.
[11:30:11] <quanticle> The cranes are right by the dockside - they take containers off ships and either put them on the quay, or onto a waiting flatbed truck or train carriage. If the container has to be transported off to a temporary holding area, it's moved by a forklift.
[11:31:04] <Gurkenglas> Maybe the video isn't a representative moment in time, but those U-frames sure seem mostly stationary.
[11:31:28] <quanticle> Yeah? And? I guess I don't understand what the purpose of sorting all these containers by owner actually is.
[11:31:53] <quanticle> It doesn't seem to me that you're going to get all that much space by getting rid of the rows between containers.
[11:32:07] <Gurkenglas> Then, assuming an owner only wants any one of his containers, you can bury almost all of his containers behind the others, removing the "move thousands of containers" problem that may otherwise result from packing the rows.
[11:32:09] <quanticle> The rows are much smaller than the width of a single container.
[11:32:17] <Gurkenglas> -packing the rows+packing the space between the rows
[11:32:20] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[11:32:42] <quanticle> Right, but what I'm saying is that you've suggested an enormous amount of work for a very marginal amount of extra space.
[11:34:17] <quanticle> And the problem isn't the amount of space at the port, anyway. The problem is that the containers are sitting at the port, and aren't being taken away. Packing the containers at the port more tightly does nothing to solve that issue.
[11:34:36] <PapuaHardyNet> why are people not taking their stuff from these containers
[11:34:44] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, the containers are empty.
[11:35:04] <Gurkenglas> I think it's a counterintuitively non-enormous amount of work to reshuffle the containers: you don't actually need to drive them across the country.
[11:36:37] *** Quits: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[11:36:53] <quanticle> No, it's absolutely an enormous amount of work. There are a million containers, and the port is already full, so you don't have a lot of scratch space to work with. So you're going to be swapping containers a few at a time. You're on the wrong end of the speed/memory tradeoff, to put it in computing terms.

[11:49:01] <Gurkenglas> But yeah you're probably right that "empty containers are left at the port" makes little sense because they're not going to be loaded at the port, so "port raises rent until the situation improves" should help.
[11:50:03] <Gurkenglas> And also, incidentally, incentivize them to increase capacity.
[11:51:33] <Gurkenglas> Was the problem that it was more profit for them to hold chassis-with-empty-container hostage until it pays a bribe to get emergency permission to unload that container there indefinitely?

[11:52:17] <Gurkenglas> yeah, that comment is why I originally came here
[11:52:30] <quanticle> Right, but you didn't get the point of that comment.
[11:52:50] <quanticle> Which is the point that I was trying to make: optimizing for storage is dumb, optimizing for throughput is better. 
[11:52:50] <Gurkenglas> because he claimed ~"they have reasonable container placement rules" and they didnt look reasonable
[11:53:18] <quanticle> They have dumb container placement rules if your goal is to pack the port full of containers.
[11:53:33] <quanticle> The container placement rules probably make sense if your goal is to move containers.
[11:54:18] <Gurkenglas> His first two paragraphs are definitely favoring storage capacity as important, and the rest doesn't mention throughput either
[11:55:10] <quanticle> No, his paragraphs are talking about storage capacity at the port. Improving storage capacity elsewhere improves throughput at the port.
[11:55:15] <quanticle> Which is the whole problem!
[11:55:20] <quanticle> The port has enough space!
[11:55:47] <quanticle> But if the containers aren't moving then it doesn't really matter how much space the port has, the port will fill up. You need to make space elsewhere to allow containers to move through the port.
[11:56:48] <Gurkenglas> The port will fill up eventually, but every container beyond that means one more chassis sitting in the parking lot, so it makes sense to put that off.

[12:00:23] <quanticle> Also, one thing missing from the discussion is whether the change worked.
[12:00:37] <quanticle> Did the rule change actually improve conditions at the port?
[12:00:42] <quanticle> Did anyone actually follow up and check?
[12:01:06] <Gurkenglas> i read something about that, uh, 80 ships waiting in line went down to 72?
[12:01:08] <quanticle> Or did we all take it on faith that Mr. Flexport's diagnosis was correct and pat ourselves on the back in a self-satified manner after getting the rule changed?
[12:03:11] <quanticle> Okay, but how do we know that the number of ships waiting went down due to the change? Also a drop from 80 to 72, while certainly good, isn't anywhere near the level of change we need to see to clear the blockage at the port. From what I read, prior to the current backup, ships were waiting for about 1-2 days to unload. Now they're waiting almost two weeks.

[12:07:16] <quanticle> For example, there was a similarly ballyhooed change at Long Beach to allow 24-hour operations, hopefully to speed up the rate at which companies could remove containers from the port.

[12:29:58] <quanticle> "When Flexport Inc. learned in the past month that an ocean carrier planned to shift cargo from the congested operations at the Port of Los Angeles to little Port Hueneme some 80 miles up the California coast, the freight forwarder found that trucking companies weren‚Äôt ready to go along with the changing direction of the imports. 'We talked to trucking carriers throughout the market in L.A.

The San Francisco-based company shifted gears, pulling 200 containers from the ocean booking and instead routing many of them to Los Angeles despite a likely longer wait there to offload goods."

[12:30:03] <Robomot> Shippers Find New Supply-Chain Hurdles at Alternate Ports  - WSJ (Shortages of trucking, rail and warehouse capacity at alternative gateways cause headaches for importers seeking to avoid the logjam at the Southern California ports.)
[12:30:04] <quanticle> Though, some of the smaller ports are getting traffic now. The story mentions that shippers are starting to bring ships in to Portland.
[12:32:58] <quanticle> One obstacle with moving to alternative ports is the fact that a lot of truck drivers go into drayage specifically because it allows them to be home at the end of every night (unlike long-haul trucking, which can involve weeks away from home). So if you shift to an alternative port, that means hiring local drivers, and there may not be enough of those to go around to handle the necessary volume
[12:33:00] <quanticle> of containers.
[12:33:02] <quanticle> There's also the fact that everyone is expecting this surge to eventually abate. So yes, we could invest in additional port capacity, hiring drivers, buying trucks, but what's the point of doing all that if, in 2022, all that idle capacity will be sitting around doing nothing but costing you money?

[18:20:50] <Robomot> Ptasie mleczko - Wikipedia (Ptasie mleczko (Polish: [pta…ï…õ ml…õt Çk…î] (listen)) is a soft chocolate-covered candy filled with soft meringue or milk souffl√©.[1] It is called ptichye moloko (–ø—Ç–∏—á—å–µ –º–æ–ª–æ–∫–æ, [Ààpt ≤it…ïj…™ m…ôl…êÀàko]) in Russian, lapte de pasƒÉre ([Ààlapte de Ààpas…ôre]) in Romanian, ptashyne moloko (–ø—Ç–∞—à–∏–Ω–µ –º–æ–ª–æ–∫–æ) in Ukrainian, and linnupiim in Estonian. ‚Ä¶)
[18:21:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> "In Russia, ptichye moloko was originally a type of confectionery introduced in 1967 in Vladivostok and in 1968 by the Rot Front factory in Moscow. It became a hit, and mass production was started in 1975 by the Krasny Oktyabr ("Red October") confectionery factory in Moscow.[9][13]" ... factually true, but elides the best part of the story:
[18:22:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> "After the trip of the USSR Minister of Food Industry V.P. Zotov to Czechoslovakia in 1967, where he was "smitten" with very tasty whipped candies of local production, representatives of all confectionery factories in the country were gathered at the Moscow factory " Rot Front " and given the task of confectioners to make the same sweets - according to the sample, but without a [recipe] [4] ." (from the Russian WP page)
[18:24:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> So out of all of those confectionery factories, one (!) managed to replicate the candy in this "clean room" fashion (the Vladivostok confectionery factory), and not only did they figure out how to make it, they made twice as much (!) as the plan called for (talk about heroic Stakhanovites)

[18:31:47] <pompolic> lmao
[18:31:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's so popular that they construct a special production facility just to churn out these cakes, but it's so popular that it's still almost impossible to acquire (the WP article doesn't say this but the obvious inference is that most of the things didn't even make it to the store/restaurant, they were no doubt diverted to black-market distribution)

[18:35:47] <Obormot\Arcturus>  persecuted by the Nazis.[10] The war devastated Poland and the company; the buildings at Warsaw were destroyed during the Warsaw Uprising.[9] After the war, Wedel rebuilt the factory, only to have the communist government nationalize the company.[7][9]"

[23:25:04] <rmmh> I wonder how many people confuse the medium and the message 
[23:25:37] <rmmh> yes, side notes and clean layout and typography are nice, but it's a shell to hold content

[23:26:40] <rmmh> "if I css it, content will come!" 
[23:29:13] <gwern> the trick is to despise css so you'd rather go write 10k words on talking horses than learn more about it
[23:29:47] <rmmh> roblox has been down for 3+ days lmao https://status.roblox.com/

[23:34:11] <two2thehead> tl;dw they are doing it relatively brute-forced-ly
[23:34:57] <two2thehead> I'm trying to figure out the best sensor to use here. I'm leaning towards just electro-optical (aka what the human eye can see)
