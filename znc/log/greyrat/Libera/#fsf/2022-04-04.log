[00:38:41] <tpefreedom> should a distro's default browser come with librejs and/or noscript (or equivalent) enabled by debault then, jacobk?
[00:41:15] <jacobk> tpefreedom: I don't know what the best solution is, but LibreJS seems like a bad solution to me. I think NoScript (without the default trusted list that includes youtube.com) would be a better option.
[00:41:15] <jacobk> But, it might be best to just set javascript.enabled to false for now, but then have an explanation somewhere explaining how to enable JavaScript, as well as the problems is poses, as well as some recommendations for extensions to install if enabling JavaScript.
[00:41:32] <jacobk> In the long term I think Haketilo would be ideal, but that's not finished yet.
[00:41:51] <tpefreedom> Haketilo?
[00:41:53] <jacobk> https://hydrillabugs.koszko.org/projects/haketilo/wiki/
[00:41:56] <tpefreedom> what does it do?
[00:42:28] <tpefreedom> ah
[00:42:29] <tpefreedom> cool
[00:42:59] <jacobk> It blocks all JS by default and allows enabling it on a per-page basis, but the important part is it makes installing alternative JavaScript much easier.
[00:43:46] <jacobk> The operating system could include several scripts as part of it's Haketilo installation, which could make the web pretty seamless without any freedom problems.

[11:41:02] <Andrew>  the non-ulticast routing breaks

[11:41:18] <qrpnxz> you know what else doesn't work with librejs tho: gitlab, discourse, meet.jit.si, bigbluebutton demo. Sadly hypothetically compatible with freedom doesn't mean the provider cares to make it so.

[13:25:48] <DiffieHellman> Most likely Debian doesn't modify firefox ESR, or has gotten special approval.

[21:29:25] <Guest94> Nice to meet you, IJ. I'm not a fan of limiting expression, just aiming for context-appropriateness. Promoting the importance of free software to the world is somewhat different from an environment such as a frat party, where expressiveness truly reigns supreme. I'd like to think one can keep a foot in both worlds while respecting the sensibilities
[21:29:26] <Guest94> of very different audiences. Obviously we get guests here hoping to discover that that software freedom is appropriate for their world, whatever each world's environment is like.
[21:29:58] <[itchyjunk]> Why does my nick prevent your from promoting free software?
[21:30:21] <[itchyjunk]> Most irc client has a feature of `/ignore nick` whereby you won't see me.
[21:30:54] <[itchyjunk]> Might not be the ideal solution you hoped for but it's might be enough since you mostly don't want to see me.

[21:47:40] <Noisytoot> IRC does not have per-channel nicks
[21:48:43] <[itchyjunk]> Can client be scripted to not show certain nicks on nick list?
[21:49:06] <zleap> [itchyjunk], not sure you can ignore users
[21:49:09] <Guest94> Your nick does not prevent me from promoting (and using) free software. Perhaps a bright 12-year old or other person valuable to the movement would be a little put off at stepping into another environment where unwelcome innuendos are the norm. Or perhaps a reporter would be making a one-time judgment about the movement's culture before going to
[21:49:10] <Guest94> press, and then there is no opportunity for us to un-publish such bad press, and the benefits of our movement become lost or side-tracked. As I promote free s/w I never try to turn off new people who bring their own curiosity and life experience to our banquet. Of course it's harder to welcome such a broad swath of the world by saying "Come join
[21:49:10] <Guest94> us, but first do the housekeeping chore of opting out of everything we're showing you that really doesn't serve a useful role for our message (by using the 'ignore' feature)." "IRC" is a very broad universe, but it is still segmented into purpose-driven chat rooms. I would have expected that the foundation is not in a hurry to race to the bottom in
[21:49:11] <Guest94> terms of expressiveness. We may adopt one persona at a frat party and another at an office, and another when promoting a precious idea to strangers that we want to respect. I still want to be exposed to your contributions (so the 'ignore' won't serve me here), and--for example--when meeting you I wouldn't care how you were dressed, as long as you
[21:49:11] <Guest94> were actually dressed, and that would remove any unnecessary distractions from what we came to discuss.
[21:50:12] <Noisytoot> zleap: All good clients implement an ignore feature
[21:50:40] <zleap> i don't think that will remove that user from the user list though
[21:50:56] <[itchyjunk]> The userlist can be ordered differently it seems.
[21:51:11] <[itchyjunk]> So i'd be at the bottom out of sight. My nick is at the bottom already in my client.
[21:51:44] <Noisytoot> There are only two nicks below you on my client
[21:51:49] <zleap> you are at the bottom in hexchat too (well near the bottom)
[21:51:58] <[itchyjunk]> Same. I guess we're on hexchat.
[21:52:33] <zleap> we should _all_ feel welcome here, despite people having opposing views,  airing different views does help us exchange idea
[21:52:50] <[itchyjunk]> Seems like you can hide nick list completly in webchat.
[21:53:31] <notdaniel> Imo "itchyjunk" is far from the most offensive thing you'll find even on libera
[21:54:10] <zleap> in hexchat it is - settings > preferences > userlist
[21:54:20] <zleap> you can reorder a-z, z-a for example
[21:54:45] <Guest94> The best-case scenario would be not to put the burden on each new user or each new chat to notice and then execute an 'ignore' command on a user such as 'fart27' or whatever worse--or carefully coded-- nicks may be encountered. Again--colorful nicks welcome in some contexts, but causing valuable visitors to tune out FSF after their first encounter
[21:54:46] <Guest94> before getting to meat of what 'fart27' may have to contribute. Surely nobody would prevent 'fart27' from starting a separate chat room, or impacting a message other than the free software message being promoted here.
[21:54:47] <[itchyjunk]> Oh neat! i remember irssi being able to change ordering.
[21:55:36] <[itchyjunk]> Well, sounds like you're asking for a ban. The topic seems to have the op names. You should probably pm them directly.
[21:55:55] <zleap> you can move it too, so you can have channel list and user list on top of each other too
[21:56:24] <Guest94> Given a choice, I choose not to preface my free software messaging with "Hi, my friends call me King <objectionable> and here's why you'd like to compute as I do."
[21:57:05] <zleap> I clearly missed what happened earlier
[21:57:16] <zleap> but I agree, we need to keep this channel appropriate to all,  
[21:57:46] <Guest94> I don't ask for a ban. I invite users to show the best judgment when choosing a persona for telling a respected stranger why the messaging in an FSF chat can lead to a better computing life for that stranger.
[21:58:40] <zleap> the best messages can / will be lost if your nick sounds inappropriate

[22:14:15] <Guest94> '12345' and 'Janet' and 'Neosho' are arbitrary identifiers too. Appropriateness stops being unreservedly subjective when we begin structuring and promoting an environment for a specific activity. Cities don't have curse words as their names, for example, even though they could if they wanted to, like that one in Austria, but it's instructive to
[22:14:15] <Guest94> keep in mind that the city is not an English-speaking city and definitely did not decide that they wanted to "tweak" foreign visitors--or challenge visitors' concepts of appropriateness--when the name was selected centuries ago. It should be easy to master the idea that a sales person is going to be washed, respectfully dressed, and using polite
[22:14:16] <Guest94> language, when they are on-duty.

[22:17:48] <zleap> there is is contextual judgement, i agree there
[22:21:47] <Guest94> Hacking scripts at 1:00 a.m. with buddies is one kind of environment, but selling a serious and imporant (and fun) message on a non-profit chat room built for messaging is probably not the same kind of environment. This isn't the same idea as censorship or not being able to be understand subjectivity--those concepts aren't what's at stake here.
[22:21:47] <Guest94> Anyway, I think I've said what I was hoping to, so I'll go silent and hope to see some regular FSF traffic scroll by. Perhaps I'll learn some interesting things about the topic I came here for, but I'm not introducing my impressionable kids to this chat room today. Cheers.

[23:37:29] <kompowiec2> cool demo for normies
[23:39:23] <qrpnxz> more like 🔰s

[23:40:14] <kompowiec2> normies can't know emacs and especially org mode. I myself didn't know about its existence for many years because I used vim.
[23:41:03] <kompowiec2> inb4 vim org mode, is incomplete therefore i try with evil plugin

[23:44:41] <zleap> qrpnxz, probably not, but it does save having to install LaTeX, allows you to work from anywhere, via the site
[23:44:58] <zleap> they take care of upgrading too
[23:45:48] <qrpnxz> installing latex takes like 20 sec. on any free OS so not too impressed
[23:46:40] <qrpnxz> latex being a Plain Text™️ format also means it's perfect for git based collab as well

[23:46:59] <zleap> indeed
[23:47:27] <zleap> Overleaf will also save to git repositories.

[23:49:41] <zleap> qrpnxz, end of the day,  if i use overleaf, you're using normal git or just text files we can still collaborate 
[23:50:34] <zleap> for writing i have found LaTex easier, if we can make using it less painful for non techies then lets do that

[23:52:01] <qrpnxz> what's painful about editing a text file xD
[23:52:12] <zleap> i mean getting started
[23:52:17] <zleap> for non techie users
[23:52:18] <qrpnxz> if that's too painful, maybe go into carpentry or smth haha

[23:53:02] <zleap> lets try and get people off MS word et al when writing
[23:53:22] <kompowiec2> idk most people know how to use notepad lol
[23:53:45] <zleap> how many uni courses actually teach LaTeX ?
[23:54:12] <kompowiec2> latex maybe not but org mode, why not
[23:55:01] <qrpnxz> woooow, latex license sucks oof
[23:55:02] <zleap> i kinda get the impression people find out about LaTeX and wished they had kmown about it earlier
[23:55:49] <kompowiec2> i try using latex for bullet journaling, until I discovered org mode.
[23:56:16] <zleap> ah
[23:56:27] <zleap> like with anything there is a good tool for it
[23:56:37] <kompowiec2> in other cases, like work i just use libreoffice
[23:56:50] <zleap> so if you are writing a essay, paper etc then LaTeX does have an edge
[23:57:06] <zleap> esp if you want to cite stuff, or write long documents
