First, historical knowledge about what happens at tech companies is lost at a fairly high rate and we think it's nice to preserve some of it.

One of his assertions is that most people—or perhaps only most of his readers, because if you're consuming something "it's for you"—are narcissists, but the two main beliefs he assigns us narcissists seem to be deeply conflicted. 1. …)
[01:56:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> People in this thread do a quite reasonable job of interpreting TLP's whole "narcissism" thing, basically summarizing it as "seeing yourself as the star of a movie about you" (with other people existing merely as supporting characters, etc., and never ever thinking of the effect your actions have on them)
[01:56:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> But put that way, you know what immediately comes to mind?

[02:12:47] <quanticle> In combat, the default is to panic and fire wildly. The entire point of training is to fix that.
[02:13:19] <quanticle> Or, alternatively, you build your military tactics around people firing wildly, like the Taliban did in Afghanistan
[02:14:27] <quanticle> Where they realized very quickly that their wild shooting wasn't actually doing anything but attracting return fire, so they took advantage of that and used untrained riflemen as bait to distract US forces while they moved in their actual striking weapon: the rocket propelled grenade

[03:27:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> If you port the code server-side, you don't even need it
[03:28:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> The point of the class is so you can annotate a link with no-icon in your build code, so that the client-side JS can then know not to icon a link
[03:28:25] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: I think it's good to be able to specify it. I might want to do '[foo](/bar){.link-type="no-icon"}', say

[03:28:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Right
[03:29:30] <gwern> it just seems a bit redundant to have the link icon metadata split across a class and also 2 attributes. no-icon is an icon-type - the null icon

[03:31:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: ... is that in CSS you can do things like "a[data-link-icon]", which means "an <a> that has *any* value set for the `data-link-icon` attribute"
[03:31:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> But if you have e.g. `data-link-icon="none"`, well, then that rule will match
[03:31:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> But that's not what you want

Munroe.[5][22][23], who Smith called "probably the greatest high-explosives man yet to live."[9] Smith completed his PhD in chemical engineering[18] in 1918,[24] with a food engineering focus; his dissertation, The effect of bleaching with oxides of nitrogen upon the baking quality and commercial value of
[03:46:58] <Obormot\Arcturus>  wheat flour, was published in 1919.[25] "
[03:47:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... wait a minute, is Doc Smith the reason we have bleached flour???
[03:47:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> My god
[03:48:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> "This initially entailed almost a year's worth of 18-hour days and seven-day workweeks. Individuals who knew Smith confirmed that he had a role in developing mixes for doughnuts and other pastries, but the contention that he developed the first process for making powdered sugar adhere to doughnuts cannot be substantiated.[52] Smith was reportedly dislocated from his job at Dawn Donuts by prewar rationing in early 1940.[53]"
[03:48:24] <Obormot\Arcturus>  ... 
[03:49:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Heinlein reported that E. E. Smith perhaps took his "unrealistic" heroes from life, citing as an example the extreme competence of the hero of Spacehounds of IPC. He reported that E. E. Smith was a large, blond, athletic, very intelligent, very gallant man, married to a remarkably beautiful, intelligent, red-haired woman named MacDougal (thus perhaps the prototypes of 'Kimball Kinnison' and 'Clarissa MacDougal'). In Heinlein'
[03:49:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> s essay, he reports that he began to suspect Smith might be a sort of "superman" when he asked Smith for help in purchasing a car. Smith tested the car by driving it on a back road at illegally high speeds with their heads pressed tightly against the roof columns to listen for chassis squeaks by bone conduction—a process apparently improvised on the spot. "
[03:51:09] <gwern> I can say that is not remotely the image I had in my head of 'E. E. "Doc" Smith, space pulp author extraordinaire'
[03:51:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> "An inarguable influence was described in a June 11, 1947, letter[77] to Smith from John W. Campbell (the editor of Astounding, where much of the Lensman series was originally published). In it, Campbell relayed Captain Cal Laning's[78] acknowledgment that he had used Smith's ideas for displaying the battlespace situation (called the "tank" in the stories) in the design of the United States Navy's ships' Combat Information
[03:51:24] <Obormot\Arcturus>  Centers. "The entire set-up was taken specifically, directly, and consciously from the Directrix. In your story, you reached the situation the Navy was in—more communication channels than integration techniques to handle it. You proposed such an integrating technique and proved how advantageous it could be. You, sir, were 100% right. As the Japanese Navy—not the hypothetical Boskonian fleet—learned at an appalling
[03:51:24] <Obormot\Arcturus>  cost." "
[03:51:47] <gwern> what on earth is a tank or battlespace
[03:52:06] <mst> Lapis Lazuli and Lorelie Lee are in Time Enough For Love, yeah
[03:52:56] <mst> btw, if it's useful to anybody, some years ago I decided to google for a copy of the Notebooks Of Lazarus Long interludes in that book, and only found one ... which had -just- gone down but was still in google cache
[03:53:01] <mst> so http://trout.me.uk/lazarus.html happened
[03:53:01] <Robomot> From the notebooks of Lazarus Long
[03:53:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> ooh nice
[03:54:18] <mst> wouldn't surprise me if more copies had popped up since, but at the point where that cache expired I was the only copy I could find, and damned if I was letting it fall off the internet entirely especially given how often I tend to want to quote from it
[04:00:07] <quanticle> gwern: The "tank" is a term for a holographic tactical display that shows the positions of all the ships, planes, etc, in a particular region (the aforementioned "battlespace")
[04:01:31] <quanticle> So basically he was responsible for designing the tac screens in the US Navy's Combat Information Centers (indirectly)

[04:25:08] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: the | guard expressions match in order, so the PDF rule right now is the last and thus lowest precedence. I think that takes care of them all, doesn't it?
[04:26:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hmm yes I think that's right. Since the conditions are all of the form "whatever, AND it's NOT a pdf"
[04:26:45] <gwern> similarly, I am going to put the deepmind rule at the top, so it will match first and override any PDF or other filetype icons
[04:26:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Right
[04:27:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Same reason it's at the top of Links.targetLinkTypes
[04:28:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: One tidbit I was reminded of by looking at the .js just now - the `local-archive-link` class is at least partly a thing I add in JS (do you ever add that server-side? I am not sure), where what you actually have in the annotations is `localArchive`, I think
[04:28:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> But in any case it's an "is this a local archive link" condition so I'm sure you know how best to check for that

[06:45:45] <gwern> hm. so it matches the hostname or tries to find it under /docs/www/
[06:46:00] <gwern> also, is the class for PDFs actually necessary in addition to the data-?
[06:47:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> mmm no it can probably be folded into an icon type ... if anything in link.css relies on .link-pdf, I'll change it
[06:48:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh nothing does, already
[06:48:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Cool
[06:48:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah kill it
[06:50:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: The change to hostname matching is to make sure it matches the actual hostname (of the link, or of the original link - but in any case the hostname and not, like, some unrelated part of the URL, or shit like "www.google.com.spammersite.hn.website.xxx")
[06:51:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hence the RegExps which say e.g. /(.+\.)?bloomberg.com$/ and not, say, /bloomberg.com/
[06:51:44] <Robomot> Bloomberg.com (Bloomberg delivers business and markets news, data, analysis, and video to the world, featuring stories from Businessweek and Bloomberg News)
[06:52:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> (and check against only the "hostname", which itself is... etc., see the code)
[06:53:03] <gwern> I see. well, I already wrote the host extracting, so shouldn't be too hard to check either the host or a docs/www/ concatenation
[06:54:48] <gwern> I think in that specific case it's unnecessarily general. I can't see anything besides 'www.bloomberg.com'
[06:54:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> (In short, I took care to ensure that when you say "links to justice.gov", the code does what you mean)
[06:54:49] <Robomot> Bloomberg.com (Bloomberg delivers business and markets news, data, analysis, and video to the world, featuring stories from Businessweek and Bloomberg News)
[06:55:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Yes, I was actually going to mention that - many of the regexps can probably be turned into exact-match strings if in fact you know that you only link to some specific subdomain etc.
[06:55:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> I used regexps in many cases because I couldn't know that it was safe to do otherwise
[06:59:57] <gwern> hm. yeah, the subdomains are a problem
[07:01:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> The subdomains indeed are the reason for those regexps, yes
[07:01:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Notice their form: e.g. /(.+\.)?bloomberg.com$/
[07:01:22] <gwern> reversing order in domains was a huge mistake -_-
[07:01:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> i.e., "possibly: [whatever, followed by a dot]; then, bloomberg.com; then, end"
[07:02:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Reversing order? How do you mean
[07:03:06] <gwern> I mean having 'www.bloomberg.com/~foo/index' instead of 'com/bloomberg/www/~foo/index'. you can't just match on 'com/bloomberg/'

Back then, people were so eager to get her their résumés that a young woman once looked up Dyba’s photo on LinkedIn and then waited outside her office
[07:24:54] <feepbot> on Madison Avenue to intercept her on her way into work. On another occasion, Dyba, making conversation with a possible hire, mentioned that she had a fondness for toffee — and the next day, toffee, beautifully wrapped, appeared in her office. Back then, the people she was hiring were hungry, they were eager. There were flowers. Carefully crafted thank-you notes. Those were
[07:24:54] <feepbot> things a recruiter might not expect but might occasionally enjoy. A recruiter felt wanted...“They think we’re like used-car salesmen,” Dyba said of her quarry. To be a recruiter in tech is to be an in-demand commodity for those companies doing the hiring but to feel like something of a nuisance — like an essential gear that emits a loud, irritating noise.'

[07:26:08] <SDr> tech companies always ever have a hiring crisis
[07:26:22] <quanticle> Yeah, just like nursing
[07:26:43] <gwern> the crisis has various intensities and contractions and can just take forever, like childbirth
[07:27:28] <gwern> probably wasn't much of a crisis in 2009, and didn't everyone temporarily freeze in 2020? I remember DL denialists triumphally pointing to linkedin and other bogus stats about no one hiring
[07:27:49] <gwern> (spoiler: DL got better)
[07:27:51] <quanticle> No, there wasn't really a freeze in 2020
[07:27:55] <quanticle> Heck, I changed jobs in 2020
[07:28:02] <quanticle> January of 2020
[07:28:25] <gwern> pfft. january 2020 was a fool's paradise. we all danced on clouds, refusing to look down
[07:28:30] <gwern> looking down was for coyotes
[07:28:40] <quanticle> True
[07:28:57] <quanticle> But in any case, the freeze, such as it was, was pretty short lived. Two, three months max
[07:29:19] <gwern> and I'm sure moms appreciate any break in between contractions. and the epidurals
[07:29:42] <quanticle> I just remember people complaining about tech hiring being difficult in like the 2012-2013 era
[07:30:04] <quanticle> And now when I see the same people making the same complaint, ten years on, I don't have a lot of sympathy
[07:30:11] <quanticle> Not that I had a lot of sympathy back then either
[07:31:59] <quanticle> I think a large part of the reason tech recruiters have such a bad reputation is that they don't really recruit. They're more like human job boards. You ask them, "Do you have jobs," they say, "Yes, here are the jobs that we have," but once you've applied, they don't really do anything. You still have to do all the work yourself. You still have to go through the bullshit interviewing process
[07:32:01] <quanticle> yourself. 
[07:32:41] <quanticle> This is true of both first party and third party recruiters. They're literally there to be the human heat shield to insulate companies from the consequences of their failing hiring pipelines.
[07:33:54] <quanticle> And so when I read a recruiter complaining about his or her job, I take it with as much seriousness as a warehouse worker complaining that they have to lift packages all day. Yes, what did you think you signed up for? A beach vacation?
[07:34:28] <quanticle> Less seriousness, in fact. A warehouse worker can actually fuck up their back.
[07:38:46] <PapuaHardyNet> I remember reading that recruiter post - I think gwern linked it a few days ago too. Very "mfw people don't suck me off like they used to" feeling

[07:46:34] <feepbot> <gwern> 'When working with one employer in a city that is not known as a tech hub, Dyba felt that she had to chip away, carefully, at the company’s insistence for on-site workers; one position had been open for six months. Dyba started showing the hiring manager the credentials for someone she’d found, but omitted a crucial detail. If the employer was interested, then and only
[07:46:34] <feepbot> then did she reveal that the talent was based in Florida or Boston. “I had to kind of say, ‘Listen, it’s costing more money right now for us to keep this job open than it would be for you to send someone a laptop and coach your leadership team differently about how to manage remotely,’” she said. She believes the hiring manager raised the issue with the chief executive;
[07:46:34] <feepbot> slowly, someone with decision-making power came around, and Dyba was able to start filling positions. When the pandemic ebbs and local workers are back in that office, 15 to 20 percent of its work force will be remote.' <-- automation as colonization wave. the transition costs are real
[07:51:34] <feepbot> <gwern> '“If you wouldn’t mind kind of talking me through your background, I would love to hear a little bit more about you and what you’ve been doing,” she said. The young man on the other end of the phone was lovely and polite, with a Master of Science degree in business analytics. Dyba was immediately charmed, if only because — unlike so many tech recruits — he
[07:51:34] <feepbot> didn’t start the conversation by asking, within the first six minutes, what the compensation was.' <-- noooo! you fool! you're selling yourself out!

[10:34:27] <Robomot> Capcom announces next-gen Street Fighter sequel, return to rollback netcode | Ars Technica (RE Engine suggested by Capcom's most detailed fighting game characters yet.)
[10:41:20] <nshepperd2> what's that
[10:42:08] <feep[work]> "not input delay"
[10:42:10] <feep[work]> apparently
[10:42:33] <feep[work]> like, from what I'm reading it's just regular netcode, the way you'd normally build it, local prediction plus remote correction
[10:42:49] <feep[work]> but apparently fighting games were doing a different thing involving waiting for input to be remotely acknowledged..?
[10:43:35] <feep[work]> so I guess we're just doing another cycle of reinvent an old thing, call it a new name, declare progress
[10:46:39] <quanticle> Well, it's more like fighting games adopting the netcode that literally everyone else uses
[10:47:06] <quanticle> There's a common library: https://github.com/pond3r/ggpo
[10:47:07] <Robomot> GitHub - pond3r/ggpo: Good Game, Peace Out Rollback Network SDK
[11:01:25] <quanticle> feep[work]: The reason, historically, for fighting games avoiding rollback based netcode has been
[11:01:32] <quanticle> 1. Online play just wasn't that important
[11:01:49] <quanticle> 2. Rollback based netcode requires more work for animations
[11:02:16] <quanticle> Because you have to handle the cases where a rollback occurred without it looking jarring for the player
[11:02:46] <adiabatic> also most japanese devs don't care about how their games work when players are being matched across an entire continent
[11:03:18] <quanticle> Yeah, that's part of (1). Most Japanese fighting games are played in arcades, with both players' controllers hooked up to the same machine
[11:04:06] <quanticle> A lot of Japanese fighting games were initially designed without any online support at all
[11:04:20] <quanticle> Then when online became a thing, they added it in the laziest way possible
[11:04:44] <quanticle> Which means delay-based netcode
[11:04:52] <feep[work]> yeah I remember borderlands
[11:04:56] <feep[work]> that was fun
[11:05:12] <feep[work]> (for context, borderlands had local prediction for movement .... but not for jumping)
[11:05:18] <quanticle> lmao
[11:05:27] <feep[work]> leading to very delayed hops :D
[11:05:29] <quanticle> So you'd have people just teleporting into the air?
[11:05:32] <quanticle> Oh
[11:05:34] <quanticle> Haha
[11:06:01] <feep[work]> any sort of jumping puzzle required careful timing :D
[11:06:17] <quanticle> Well, only when playing online with friends.
[11:06:22] <feep[work]> yeah, you know
[11:06:32] <feep[work]> only when playing the game in the environment it was overtly designed for
[11:06:57] <quanticle> I don't think I actually played Borderlands 1 online. I played Borderlands 2 online, but I think BL2 had rollback-based netcode, because I didn't notice any issues.

[11:08:38] <quanticle> But yeah, as the article points out, the one big advantage of delay-based netcode is that it's super easy to shim into a game that wasn't designed for online play. Rollback-based netcode, on the other hand, requires you to design your input handling around the possibility of rollbacks, which, if you already have an existing game, means a significant rewrite.

[11:42:05] <quanticle> Only the greatest Chappelle show skit of all time
[11:42:08] <enterprisey> no, but I've skimmed the HN thread
[11:42:12] <quanticle> Ah
[11:42:20] <quanticle> Okay, you have the necessary background, then
[11:43:29] <enterprisey> I've never professionally used the cloud^W^Wother people's computers (oh, besides one internship), but I can imagine it has its ups and downs
[11:45:02] <quanticle> Yeah, well, I'm not reflexively against using cloud resources, like a lot of other people are. I think that people underestimate how much of a pain in the butt real physical servers are to manage. But like with anything, you need to keep your head screwed firmly to your shoulders and evaluate the costs and benefits.
[11:45:42] <enterprisey> my last job used physical servers and it was just one guy racking stuff... I have no idea why he didn't quit
[11:45:52] <quanticle> As a developer, I'd encourage people to at least get familiar with the cloud (and Terraform, more specifically). It's something that, increasingly, you'll be expected to know as more organizations move to a devops model.
[11:46:20] <enterprisey> oh and one time the server room temperature started climbing. me and my coworker told everyone responsible and nobody did anything, so we made a sport out of watching the temperature graph climb towards "critical"
[11:46:48] <enterprisey> I believe we hit 80 C on the CPU, maybe mid-40s C ambient
[11:47:07] <quanticle> 3.6 roentgen. Not great. Not terrible.
[11:47:11] <PapuaHardyNet> hell yeah, sounds very "3.6 Roentgen. Not great, not terrible"
[11:47:31] <enterprisey> then one guy's personal server (!), which was the only rack in the whole room with any sort of monitoring configured, started screaming, so he came in, got hit with a brick wall of Tropical Vacation, and got everything sorted out
[11:47:39] <enterprisey> oh sorry, did I say sorted out? they just propped the door
[11:48:01] <quanticle> They could have at least brought over a pedestal fan
[11:48:05] <PapuaHardyNet> what did they pay you to work in such a place
[11:48:25] <quanticle> Not enough. If they're cheaping out this hard on their servers, it's a fair bet that they're cheaping out equally hard on their devs.
[11:48:54] <enterprisey> PapuaHardyNet: decent money, I got sacked last month because I stopped putting in effort and looked for new jobs for like four months
[11:49:00] <PapuaHardyNet> hell yeah
[11:49:02] <quanticle> Nice
[11:49:15] <PapuaHardyNet> but did you get a new job
[11:49:39] <enterprisey> six days after I got canned, my dream job came back with an offer after two months of waiting
[11:50:04] <quanticle> Cool
[11:50:09] <enterprisey> those were exciting times...
[11:50:23] <enterprisey> actually, might as well drop some hard dox because all 145 of you in this channel seem nice enough
[11:50:34] <enterprisey> new job is a plasma control engineer at MIT SPARC, the fusion reactor

[12:05:10] <enterprisey> I'd chalk a lot of it up to luck, but still, the fact that I was able to see something exciting on the front page of hacker news, point at it and say "I want to work there", and *actually end up working there*, is very neat
[12:09:03] <feep[work]> I believe this is the purpose of hnews.
[12:09:52] <kuudes> PapuaHardyNet, no, we made our own vaccine a year ago
[12:10:17] <PapuaHardyNet> I have come to know some really impressive people in our community, and adjacent to it, and I feel quite thankful for the opportunity to be a part of it, tbh
[12:10:38] <PapuaHardyNet> we as in kuudes or we as in finland
[12:11:00] <kuudes> we as in ratvac
[12:11:26] <PapuaHardyNet> impressive also means admirable here. people worth hanging out with and helping and supporting
[12:11:49] <kuudes> yes
[12:11:55] <PapuaHardyNet> kuudes: I have no idea what ratvac is tbh. COVID saliva intranasal?
[12:12:58] <PapuaHardyNet> "you snort coke, I snort COVID. We are not the same."

This is not medical advice. tldr: In April of 2021 I …)
[12:15:54] <kuudes> in any case, now it is again 12 weeks from my last vaccine dose, so I try to get a new dose this week
[12:16:36] <PapuaHardyNet> kuudes: did you take ratvac? Sounds rather risky
[12:16:45] <kuudes> I took it intranasally
[12:17:06] <PapuaHardyNet> huh. does not sound effective
[12:17:06] <kuudes> yesterday
[12:17:28] <PapuaHardyNet> meh, tell us how it goes
[12:20:14] <saturn2> (for the record, i've changed my mind, i now think taking radvac or ratvac is a good idea)
[12:20:24] <kuudes> hmm. what do you see as the main likely harm PapuaHardyNet?
[12:20:29] <kuudes> saturn2, hmm, why?
[12:22:34] <PapuaHardyNet> unsure how taking something with an adjuvant intranasally will help - adjuvants may only affect your body's reaction to it in your lungs, perhaps
[12:23:15] <saturn2> i was against it because i thought officially approved vaccines were going to end the pandemic soon, so it was more sensible to just wait a bit longer, but clearly that isn't going to happen
[12:23:21] <PapuaHardyNet> I don't see much harm based on my understanding of how risk averse you are and seeing your enthusiasm for this
[12:23:26] <kuudes> thanks saturn2
[12:23:39] <kuudes> thanks PapuaHardyNet
[12:23:48] <ggreer> Hmm I can’t view joe rogan episodes on Spotify. I can continue playing the one I was already listening to, but it looks like Spotify is up to something
[12:24:09] <kuudes> intranasal use would mainly hope to prevent or harm the virus first phase replication, which happens in nose area cells
[12:24:15] <ggreer> All my other podcasts work just fine in Spotify
[12:24:20] <kuudes> ie reduce infection probability
[12:24:41] <PapuaHardyNet> that sounds like a stretch
[12:25:09] <PapuaHardyNet> why will you get a localized improved immune response?
[12:25:14] <ggreer> Maybe it’s a software bug. Rogan’s podcast probably has a bunch of rare flags on it in the db
[12:25:57] <kuudes> I am in the understanding that is what the nasal vaccines are trying to do, and that this is why they are specifically used that way
[12:26:13] <PapuaHardyNet> I see
[12:26:14] <kuudes> but I admit I have little actual knowledge in the matter
[12:26:43] <kuudes> rokote labs vaccine candidate is basically just snorting vaxzevria/sputkin -like thing into your nose
[12:26:59] <saturn2> PapuaHardyNet: my understanding is that this is already the scientific consensus
[12:27:02] <kuudes> the chinese have trialled their vaccine nasally and there was one paper that said it had worked
[12:27:21] <kuudes> yeah, it seems generally accepted
[12:27:47] <saturn2> (why isn't there already a mainstream nasal vaccine then? it's a mystery)
[12:28:09] <kuudes> for some reason it took 9 months for rokote labs to get 10 million euros funding
[12:28:11] <kuudes> :-p
[12:28:46] <kuudes> I don't understand why we haven't used government moneys to shoot up all sorts of weird vaccine development
[12:28:48] <nshepperd2> can you just snort the MRNA vaccines
[12:28:55] <kuudes> I guess
[12:29:17] <kuudes> unsure how it feels - cold at least
[12:29:57] <kuudes> also there is low availability of mrna vaccines
[12:30:07] <kuudes> but this year we shold now have it solved
[12:30:21] <kuudes> but indeed I am trying to get another mrna shot this week
[12:30:56] <kuudes> I guess I will get omicron mrna in t+12 weeks or t+6 weeks :-/
[12:31:44] <kuudes> I would have hoped this shot would have been omicron dose already, but I presume it still takes 2-5 weeks
[12:33:31] <kuudes> so far nothing larger than possible placebo - feeling of warmthness last night, maybe swelling in cheeks
[12:37:13] <synthmeat> ggreer: yeah, same over here. getting just loader dots on the pod's page

[18:54:19] <feep> alright!
[18:54:34] <feep> project for today: I am ditching ALL my error handling stuff so far, and going to the much simpler expr?
[18:54:56] <feep> expr?: if expr returns an error value, expr? propagates it to the caller of the current function.
[18:55:40] <feep> there's about 500 instances of my previous error handling attempts in the code, so wish me luck.
[18:57:23] <gurkenglas> You were just... if-error-return-error-ing all over the place? I *guess* that carries some information about control flow. Does sound like it fits better into additional tooling or type signatures or something :)
[18:58:01] <feep> gurkenglas: nah, I'm changing syntax
[18:58:13] <feep> I was doing auto var <- expr; "propagate errors from expr"
[18:58:27] <feep> and "expr.retfail" for cases where that didn't work
[18:58:35] <feep> but I noticed that "cases where that didn't work" was most cases
[19:02:06] <feep> so I'm backing that all out and doing expr?, where ? just replaces retfail, and removing the <- syntax entirely for now.
[19:02:25] <feep> that should make the code easier to follow, understand, and write.
[19:03:07] <gurkenglas> feep, The caller also has to write ? in order to propagate that error further up the callstack, right?
[19:03:12] <feep> yep!
[19:03:24] <feep> it's ? all the way until someone decides to handle it with case{}
[19:03:37] <gurkenglas> feep, will every higher-order function like map have a version with and without "?"? :S
[19:04:07] <feep> gurkenglas: for now, those just assume no errors

[19:06:07] <gurkenglas> feep: How straightforward is it to run a program in your language backwards?
[19:06:25] <feep> gurkenglas: what does that mean
[19:06:27] <feep> probably not very
[19:06:37] <feep> I do support state.
[19:07:01] <gurkenglas> Like, the program just threw an error, let's figure out why, step 4 lines back
[19:07:06] <feep> ooh
[19:07:11] <PapuaHardyNet> time travel
[19:07:18] <feep> gurkenglas: I'm just gonna gather a stacktrace on error return
[19:07:43] <feep> if people want that sort of thing, they can instead call an error handling callback on their own
[19:07:47] <feep> and that can then do whatever it wants
[19:07:49] <kuudes> running backwards logically works only as long as functions are bijective
[19:08:09] <feep> gurkenglas: I will say that it *should* be easy to build a crash handler that has access to every variable in the program
[19:08:13] <feep> including a repl
[19:08:19] <feep> because the compiler is just a library
[19:08:26] <feep> and there's no jit backend rn but there easily could be
[19:08:30] <gurkenglas> One thing I'm disappointed linux doesn't seem to have, and it could have, is "I don't know why that string is there. Show me code that puts a string there."
[19:08:43] <feep> gurkenglas: gdb watch :p
[19:08:51] <feep> gdb maintains the memory map on rerun.
[19:08:55] <kuudes> hmm, I guess injectivity is the necessary requirement?
[19:09:00] <feep> so you can just watch a fixed address on rerun.
[19:09:32] <kuudes> f(a) -> b requires that for each b there is different a so that you can invert it
[19:09:34] <gurkenglas> kuudes: or you log your path at every noninjective place

[19:13:49] <feep> in the way that imo, all c-likes should do macros: just partially compile the code and load the result back into the compiler :D
[19:17:14] <mst> nim and zig both have intrepreted versions of the language embedded in the compiler IIRC
[19:18:06] <feep> D has too, sorta
[19:18:17] <feep> but it's an extension of the const folder, so it's painfully slow
[19:18:39] <feep> neat just has .... the language itself. it just loads objects. it fully profits from whichever backend the compiler is using.
[19:18:56] <feep> macros are at performance parity with the compiler.
[19:19:26] <feep> a lot of the stuff in D is looking at where D is slow and zagging instead of zigging
[19:19:30] <feep> er in neat
[19:19:45] <gurkenglas> feep: Do you have types, and are they first-class? :)
[19:19:46] <feep> as a result, the neat compiler is many times slower than D because walter bright is a fucking wizard

[19:20:43] <feep> gurkenglas: eeeehhhhh, in the sense that they are in a Dlike or any macro language
[19:21:00] <feep> types are firstclass in macros because you can literally access the compiler representation of a type
[19:21:32] <feep> and there's templates as well, but they're not as magic powerful. there isn't like an intermediate level where you manipulate types as values underneath the full macro "compiler as a library" level.
[19:22:10] <feep> or rather, I haven't bothered adding one
[19:22:18] <feep> maybe make a macro for it :D
[19:23:09] <gurkenglas> feep: Do you have multiple levels of desugaring, so that people can pick at what level they wanna mutate code?
[19:23:23] <feep> yep, definitely not.

[21:52:35] <PapuaHardyNet> that sounds more sensible than tiws -> diens tbh

[23:05:05] <gwern> arxiv doesn't do docx in any way shape or form. you mean pdfs?
[23:05:26] <gwern> but yes, providing clean HTML versions is the goal. albeit one that is quite a ways off if you spend some time looking at them...

[23:33:41] <gwern> what style block? you were handling all the css/js, I didn't touch any of that
[23:33:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Heh
[23:34:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> I *did* say look at links.js and replicate it exactly... :p
[23:34:14] <kuudes> also putin said ukraine is acquiring nuclear weapons and its joining to nato has been decided
[23:34:43] <gwern> (the alef is way too big, I *think* that's new. but at least the other unicode all look to be working)
[23:34:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Alef is unchanged
[23:34:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> But we can adjust it certainly
[23:35:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway
[23:35:00] <kuudes> what will the world do if putin uses nukes against ukraine?
[23:35:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Here's what you gotta do. You want to add a style block, inlined. It will... well, heck, just look at links.js, line...
[23:35:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Line 54, that comment.
[23:36:02] <gwern> isn't all that css in links.css?
[23:36:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nope, and here's why
[23:36:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> That mapping ought to be generated directly from the list of SVG icons that are in use
[23:36:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Else you have the definition duplicate in two places
[23:36:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which is a recipe for stale data, forgetting to update in one place, etc.
[23:37:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> So you should have a step in the code where you take your list of all SVG icons and generate this style block ... which ... we can probably do as a template... hang on
[23:38:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hm
[23:38:58] <gwern> uh, there is no place to put that step. links are dealt with on a per-link basis. they may not even be part of a page, like an annotation
[23:39:00] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : 'In the late nineties I got a chance to tour the legendary Massachusetts computer company Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC, later bought by Compaq), and the difference in culture was remarkable. There were people at DEC who had been working on threading (the manner in which operating systems manage concurrent sets of processor instructions) for twenty years. Half the people had PhDs in their areas of specialty. Corners were 
[23:39:00] <two2thehead> never cut for a faster release. Ah, I thought, this is why Microsoft won out.'
[23:39:52] <gwern> even if I added some special pass at the very end to grovel through a Pandoc AST and spit out the list of observed icons, that doesn't handle annotations popping in arbitrarily and bringing icons with them
[23:40:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> No no no
[23:40:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> The "all the linkicons used on the current page" design was just an optimization I did
[23:40:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Given that you're doing it server-side now, the straightforward way is to make it "all the SVG linkicons, period"
[23:41:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: This is why I made links.js use an array with definitions of the icons, rather than just a big switch/if/whatever control statement ... that way one could filter the array by "svg" linkicon type, and generate the styles that way
[23:43:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> So the generation of these styles can and should be totally independent of assigning linkicons to links, etc.
[23:43:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> It should just, without looking at any pages, take the list of svg linkicons, and spit out a style block

[23:45:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> I accept no blame! It's all in links.js! :p
[23:47:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: So that file's contents would look something like this: https://share.obormot.net/textfiles/UeRnP9lP
[23:48:32] <gwern> and we don't want to just put that in links.css because that would be slow?
[23:48:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Slow? No, I don't think it'd have any effect on performance
[23:48:56] <gwern> (or in a separate .css file)
[23:49:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh, a separate css file would be a slowdown, yes
[23:49:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not much of one. Of course it's essentially the same
[23:49:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> The key here is to generate this *from* the set of SVG linkicons, as already defined in the linkicon association code
[23:50:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> So that any updates/modifications/etc. are done once
[23:50:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Of course links.css has visual presentation tweaks, but that is different)
