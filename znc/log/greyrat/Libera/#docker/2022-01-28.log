[01:52:16] <programmerq> transhumanist: last time I ran asterisk, I remember it really hating any NAT at all. For running it in Docker, you could run a macvlan or ipvlan docker networking driver. RTP runs on top of udp, right? I'm not aware of any restrictions that docker places on udp ports-- can you elaborate?
[01:53:22] *** Quits: DrowningElysium (uid190788@user/drowningelysium) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[01:55:04] <programmerq> if you are using the docker nat stuff and want to publish a range of ports, that is possible. You might want to disable the docker userspace proxy if using the bridge driver in conjunction with that
[01:55:34] <programmerq> but if you're going to publish thousands of ports, then you might as well switch to macvlan or ipvlan or just skip any fuss at all and do host mode networking.
[01:57:01] <tabakhase> wasnt there also some deal that docker "publishes each port on its own"? - so iptables fales and one generic rule is more reasonable - dont remember the exact details there tho, that may only be a proxy not iptables limitation
[02:01:31] <tabakhase> "hates nating" is bit of a yesno - it hates natting it is not aware of, but as long as you maintain that remote networks list things are supposedly fine ((its more SIP that providers always want the shortest everthing and also cabled-lan only please :P))  [[my pbx is 3-hops-away inc. vpns, but not docker so dont quote me on anything of that]]
[02:04:27] <transhumanist> I refer to this blurb on  the subject as the source of my query...   https://community.freepbx.org/t/freepbx-in-lxd-container/77753/2

[02:09:09] <tabakhase> transhumanist this (linked) comment is fairly bang on - not fully, but generally a "yes"
[02:15:09] <transhumanist> is there any way around this issue or should I be looking at LXC or LXD or something?  I notice  this section: """ Docker, iptables and docker-proxy  """ of this page:  https://hub.docker.com/r/mlan/asterisk   indicates a couple potential work arounds mainly the use of --network-host might work better, but I am not sure of the security ramifications on doing it. (assuming dedicated raspberry pi dedicated box for the purpose) 
[02:16:49] <tabakhase> transhumanist security "when using hostmode"? - just that it has more access to the host it normally wouldnt (namely, its localhost) - just "disables the network-issolation part of docker"
[02:17:28] <transhumanist> so if its a dedicated box the only thing to worry about is its lan access
[02:18:24] <transhumanist> seems like its a promising way of making easily configurable asterisk docker container that takes advantage of docker , am I missing something?
[02:18:42] <tabakhase> why even docker it then? ;-) -- and were talking asterisk-asterisk, or freeipx as that forum thread? - for the second, dont they provide a whole distro?...
[02:19:21] <transhumanist> for easy deployability is what I was thinking
[02:19:32] <tabakhase> "dockerizing" somethign is a lot more than just "Installing it in a container" or even just "runing it in a container"
[02:20:10] <transhumanist> I guess just building a custom image for a pi would be all that would be needed, and it avoids all the containerization slow down and stuff.
[02:20:22] <transhumanist> ok thanks got what you are saying
[02:20:39] <tabakhase> http://www.raspberry-asterisk.org/
[02:21:36] <transhumanist> oh wow ok, I can certainly customize that to my liking! thanks!
[02:22:39] <tabakhase> and like, Q becomes what you call "dockerizing" too --- does one expect it to create the admin-user from env-vars? - or are you expected to be able to ship in your sip-trunk details via env-vars? - or do you exec in and run the createdb script? - where to draw the line there is kinda impossible to answer
[02:23:42] <tabakhase> and at that point you are kinda better off with a maintainable VM than a dead-in-the-water container cause 2 years down the road config has spread all over and "rebuild && recreating" breaks everything horrifically :D
[02:26:19] <transhumanist> only thing is due to the hardware of the PI I am likely to run into traffic limitations. I was thinking to give some background using asterisk to distribute my own custom telephone exchange among participants, I have a certain idea/concept in mind that would serve as an alternative to the existing telephone network with a very custom set of features.I want to test it out, thus lets say 20 Raspberry PI's would be the testing "te
[02:26:19] <transhumanist> twork"

[05:13:21] <transhumanist> cant wait till I can spend 3k on hardware and another 10 for video cards, but it will be at least two years
[05:13:33] <queue-> welcome to the party
[05:13:33] <queue-> :]
[05:13:46] <queue-> most of us run docker because we dont have money to just throw at random machines to run each app
[05:13:57] <queue-> plus its a bad utilization of resources at times
[05:14:01] <queue-> to NOT use docker

[05:16:43] <transhumanist> ya my worst enemy is nvidia stack , the fact that you cant have mulltiple copies of nvidia running in different containers with each one with a different cuda version and I still havent been able to figure out how to run the nvidia run time as a service to other containers
[05:17:16] <transhumanist> I forget what the container is called but you know the nvidia container I am referring too?
[05:17:46] <Flash> I ran into an issue with nvidia where the driver in my container was incompatible with the driver on my hardware
[05:18:00] <Flash> the container driver was too new
[05:18:55] <transhumanist> I have no idea how to run the runtime as a service to another container. this is what got me away from docker, I would like to stack containers like  a tree
[05:19:16] <transhumanist> have each container as a service to another 
[05:19:40] <transhumanist> cuts down the size and complexity and monolithic nature of the containers\
[05:21:44] <transhumanist> think its called nvidia-docker
[05:23:34] <transhumanist> this is what led to wsl2 and windows and nvidia as a combination. with docker-desktop, but this has the problem of breaking each time there is a patch and stuff that might be ok in a few years but not now
[05:23:50] <transhumanist> I was able to run models on it
[05:24:05] <transhumanist> but I started doing more iwth google colab because of all the limitations
[05:24:15] <transhumanist> you can pay for persistent storage on colab
[05:25:13] <transhumanist> anyway alpine on kvm is what I will try for this poject

[06:02:46] <transhumanist> thanks minimal
[06:03:29] <minimal> transhumanist: the Alpine "problem" with Nvidia is that Nvidia supply binary kernel module that is compiled for glibc - Alpine uses musl however as its libc
[06:03:43] *** Quits: stutz (~stutz@user/stutz) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[06:04:43] <transhumanist> right it wont compile with musl (its an Nvidia problem , actually , I miss spoke
[06:05:32] <minimal> transhumanist: no, it *cannot* compile with musl as only Nvidia has the source code
[06:05:51] <transhumanist> ya bunch of tirants
[06:06:00] <transhumanist> tyrants*
[06:06:01] <minimal> they (Nvidia) might be able to compile it for musl but as musl-based distros are "niche" they're unlikely to do so
[06:06:34] <transhumanist> how about compile libc on musl?
[06:06:49] <transhumanist> then use it to compile nvidia
[06:07:10] *** Quits: jkovac1 (~jkovac1@user/jkovac1) (Remote host closed the connection)

[06:08:13] <transhumanist> sorry I meant compile glibc with musl so you can then compile nvidia with glibc?
[06:08:27] <minimal> part of the reason Alpine is so "lightweight" is because it uses libc. It you replaced Alpine's musl with glibc then its not really Alpine anymore
[06:09:02] <transhumanist> yes but it would work wouldnt it to get the graphics working on it?
[06:09:08] <minimal> you can't use the Nvidia unless you system uses gibc as its libc - basically everything on a Linux system is built for a single libc
[06:09:11] *** Joins: yamchah2 (~yamchah2@user/yamchah2)
[06:09:36] <minimal> you'd have to recompile the whole distro to do that - in which case why not just use another glibc-based distro?
[06:09:43] *** Joins: stutz (~stutz@user/stutz)
[06:09:55] <transhumanist> ah I miss understood I thought that once its compiled its all 1's and zeros at that point
[06:10:09] <transhumanist> that is machine language
[06:10:34] <minimal> normally binaries are dynamically linked to the libc
[06:10:37] <Flash> it's the difference between static linking and dynamic linking ... everything is dynamic these days
[06:10:47] <transhumanist> ah ok
[06:11:27] <minimal> you can statically link them but that's not often done (plus the size of the binaries grows as each then has a copy of parts of libc embedded)
[06:12:09] <minimal> Flash: apart from Go stuff typically?
[06:12:49] <transhumanist> so it would work perhaps to get video working on it? that is statically link the nvidia drivers and cuda and let the rest of the system be dynamically linked? Or do I miss understand?
[06:12:52] <Flash> go isn't an OS; the language support for go is probably dynamically linked as well?

[06:15:20] <Flash> looks like go *is* statically linked
[06:15:48] <minimal> Flash: Go apps tend to be static - that's why there can be simple to turn into docker comtainers as you can just do "FROM scratch" and copy in the binary without any libs
[06:16:48] <transhumanist> so, whats the verdict it wouldnt work ?
[06:17:34] <minimal> transhumanist: Nvidia drivers you mean? use a glibc-based distro
[06:18:54] <transhumanist> ya but it sure would be great to use a super light distro as your root OS along with kqemu and have nvidia support, or are you suggesting if you have pcie pass through then its all ok except the shit desktop you would have for video support?

[15:00:12] <CoolerX> Hi
[15:00:19] <CoolerX> I am not able to expose ports
[15:00:38] <CoolerX> When I do docker ps -a it shows the port as being exposed
[15:00:48] <CoolerX> but when I curl the port I get an empty response
[15:01:11] <CoolerX> so I went inside the container using docker exec -it <container-id> bash
[15:01:32] <CoolerX> and from inside the container when I curl localhost:8080 I get a different error
[15:01:43] <CoolerX> $ curl localhost:8080

[15:04:20] <simplicity> CoolerX: did you read this https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#expose?
[15:04:45] <simplicity> The important part is "The EXPOSE instruction does not actually publish the port."

[15:28:06] <CoolerX> ash_worksi, sorry I was afk
[15:28:35] <CoolerX> https://bpa.st/AJ3A

[15:29:33] <ash_worksi> CoolerX: did you start this with docker-compose?
[15:29:45] <CoolerX> It's the Oracle database Express edition
[15:29:55] <CoolerX> ash_worksi, no I used docker run

[15:30:53] <CoolerX> simplicity, yes ik
[15:31:12] <ash_worksi> hmmm
[15:31:25] <ash_worksi> it's a bit weird to be running the DB using -it
[15:31:33] <ash_worksi> are you sure you're not supposed to be using -d ?
[15:31:58] <CoolerX> ash_worksi, I have run other images that run servers on 8080 with the -it flag
[15:32:09] <CoolerX> and those didn't have this issue
[15:32:09] <ash_worksi> (btw, for testing purposes, if it makes seed loading easier you can use --tmpfs for the actual data dir)
[15:32:30] <CoolerX> ash_worksi, I am not mounting any volumes
[15:32:57] <ash_worksi> CoolerX: Idk oracle, but for PG, the entrypoint performs setup and then shuts down; if you don't run it -d you run into funkiness
[15:33:09] <ash_worksi> (I know, that was just a tip)
[15:34:43] <ash_worksi> but in any event, what does `docker logs condescending_goldstine` say?

[15:42:36] <simplicity> https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/main/OracleDatabase/SingleInstance#running-oracle-database-21c18c-express-edition-in-a-container seems to show that what you're trying to reach on 8080 is actually on 5500?

[15:43:02] <CoolerX> simplicity, hmm
[15:43:16] <CoolerX> simplicity, ok but the 1521 port should still work

[15:43:35] <simplicity> You're not doing as they tell you to.
[15:43:58] <CoolerX> simplicity, I didn't see that section

[15:47:41] <CoolerX> ok...
[15:48:12] <CoolerX> curl localhost:8080 has worked inside other containers
[15:48:25] <CoolerX> I guess it varies per image
[15:48:33] <ash_worksi> did 127.0.0.1 work in this one?
[15:48:55] <CoolerX> ash_worksi, I stopped that one, starting a new one
[15:48:58] <CoolerX> with port 5500
[15:49:14] <CoolerX> tabakhase, yeah it takes quite a while to start
[15:49:27] <CoolerX> simplicity, ^
[15:49:55] <CoolerX> It doesn't even have any data in it
[15:50:47] <ash_worksi> it _might_ speed it up to use `--tmpfs=/opt/oracle/oradata`
[15:50:50] <CoolerX> I wonder if it would be faster if I increased the shared memory from the default 64m
[15:51:05] <tabakhase> if anywhere, it may have worked inside THIS container - each container has its own localhost --- but thats kinda unrelated anyhow as the trouble seems to be curl resolving localhost to v6 not v4  (what kinda brings the followup of operatingsystem, how did you install docker, docker-version?)

[17:59:01] <tabakhase> bn_work for run (with -d) no, whatever else is using it has to wait, there is tooling like the "wait-for" or "wait-for-it" scripts/packages people generally use ((maybe one day healthchecks can be used to "wait in-engine" but nothing like this now)
[18:01:18] <programmerq> bn_work: yeah with -d you're just telling the docker cli to just start the container and then go into the background. You can introduce a healthcheck to the container and you could do a shell script that waits for the health status to flip to healthy.
[18:01:40] <tabakhase> bn_work for stopping, it shouldnt rugpull, if it does, means you messed up signals somewhere, make sure the container runs whatever the thing is as pid1 and uses "exec" if it has a entrypoint bashscript or so - if its a "fat container" with more than 1 thing, run an actual init-system (either dockers inbuild one, or runit,s6,dumb-init or whatever, just not systemd :D) -- for the rare case that

[18:02:36] <programmerq> the docker stop behavior is to send a sigterm to the containerized process and then wait for the process to exit for 10 seconds (configurable) and then send the kill. make your process handle the sigterm or use STOPSIGNAL like tabakhase mentioned if your containerized process needs something other than TERM for it to start its graceful shutdown procedure. Adjust the grace period too, if needed.
[18:03:05] <programmerq> I have one container that is a worker. I set the time for the graceful stop to several minutes to allow plenty of time for the current job to finish up before exiting.

[18:21:53] <Tach> Has anyone compared the CPU/IO cycles between Ubuntu and Alpine ?
[18:22:13] <minimal> bn_work: as I just indicated to you the "standard/official" Alpine docker image is based on the Alpine mini root filesystem download which includes no init
[18:22:24] <tabakhase> Tach thats a nonvalid question i wanne say...
[18:22:48] <Tach> tabakhase and why is that by your meaning ?
[18:22:49] <programmerq> bn_work: I believe the stop grace period is only a runtime thing, unfortunately.
[18:22:50] <minimal> however there are plenty of Alpine-based docker images around that use various init's (tini, s6-overlay, etc)

[18:24:41] <programmerq> minimal: docker also includes the capability of enabling an init without the need for the image to include one. docker run --init --rm -it alpine ps faux
[18:24:55] <programmerq> it shows up in the ps output as docker-init and iirc it's just tini

[18:26:37] *** Quits: polymorphic (~polymorph@user/polymorphic) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[18:27:59] <tabakhase> Tach start by the deal that when in #docker - were generally talking about dead files on a disk, not even rly a distro -- the only somewhat relevant may be muslc, but where and what and how that actually shows up gets rather complicated and no generic "10% faster/slower" or such :D
[18:28:40] <programmerq> Tach: there are tons of comparisons of musl vs glibc for various situations (cpu cycles, memory usage, disk usage of compiled binaries, etc). benefits will vary by your specific application and usage pattern, but unless you're actively running into a performance issue with one or the other, both are sane choices.
[18:28:51] <programmerq> Are you trying to fill out a powerpoint slide to get buy-in from bosses?
[18:29:21] <tabakhase> if its for the poerpoint, that should be a alpine vs debian likely :P
[18:29:27] <Tach> tabakhase because everyone with docker talks about footprint... 
[18:29:35] <programmerq> lots of tech bosses know ubuntu but not debian
[18:29:35] <Tach> tabakhase same thing :)
[18:31:13] <programmerq> in general if you want to minimize your footprint, go with alpine if your application works nicely with musl. if your application doesn't support it, the ubuntu base image isn't too bad. Additionally, canonical has commercial support options so if you want to have someone to point a finger to if there's an issue, there's that.
[18:32:34] <programmerq> I use alpine regularly and I only worry about glibc vs musl in very few instances-- if I have a precompiled binary that is explicitly linked to glibc, then that's what I'll go with. Also, there's some subtle differences in the dns resolution stuff that can trip up some applications that depend on the glibc behavior, but I've only seen it cause an issue very rarely.
[18:32:56] <programmerq> Those are my anecdotes on alpine-vs-ubuntu 
[18:33:48] <minimal> yeah the main dns trip-up with Alpine is where someone assumes DNS lookup happens via the listed nameservers sequentually whereas Alpine does the lookups in parallel
[18:35:13] <minimal> some people expect to have their consul nameserver (e.g. for .consul TLD) consulted before their normal nameserver and stuff like that "breaks" in Alpine if any other listed nameserver gives a lookup failure before the consul nameserver

[18:50:22] <bn_work> so just to backup a bit, and ensure I understand, having an init system will allow signals to properly propagate to shell launched children, ie: `&`, and avoids having to write something up in bash with traps, and wait, etc. (+ gives zombie reaping ability?).  Does tini have this?  
[18:51:57] <bn_work> minimal: that's good to know, does that apply for JVM (java)-based apps too?  or does it use it's own completely different DNS resolution libs?
[18:53:15] <minimal> bn_work: don't know about Java - apps in general go via the system's libc resolvers but no idea if the Java jvm bypasses this (doubt it but its possible)
[18:53:38] <minimal> bn_work: re init AFAIK is a very very basic init, so really just for the signal passing to children
[18:54:21] <tabakhase> Tach debian-slim (and i guess ubunutu has a analog) are fairly small already and usually get you well into the "download time is neglectable" range -- alpine comes kinda extra fancy for CI/tooling, if not going all-out and multistaging for binary-only or busybox or such
[18:54:41] <minimal> when you want to run multiple processes/services inside a single container and co-ordinate them (i.e. wait for ports to be listened on, etc) that's usually where something like s6-overlay comes in

[22:43:48] <statusbot1> Status update: The problem has been identified and a fix is in progress. -- https://status.docker.com/pages/incident/533c6539221ae15e3f000031/61f42ab9b599c8052dc4cb2f
[22:48:05] <zumba_addict24> Is it possible to specify docker id/password in Dockerfile?
[22:48:26] <DoofusCanadensis> why would you want to do that?
[22:48:42] <BtbN> You can specify whatever you want in your Dockerfile, but putting secrets there seems unwise
[22:49:02] <zumba_addict24> i'm trying to figure out how to pull from docker hub then push to our internal repo
[22:49:22] <BtbN> What's there to figure out?
[22:49:23] <zumba_addict24> some of our projects use external images like nodejs
[22:49:36] <zumba_addict24> we are currently using docker login to login to our internal registry
[22:50:11] <zumba_addict24> so maybe, docker login to docker hub first and build the image, the docker login again to our internal registry
[22:50:32] <BtbN> Why log into docker hub at all, if all you're doing is pulling public images?
[22:50:39] <DoofusCanadensis> rate limits
[22:50:40] <tabakhase> its more a "both" than a "again" but sure if thats what you need
[22:50:47] <zumba_addict24> we were getting rate limits issues now
[22:51:02] <DoofusCanadensis> but that was well known for a while
[22:51:04] <zumba_addict24> we bought licenses today
[22:51:13] <zumba_addict24> we forgot about it
[22:51:15] <BtbN> Ah, just login like normal then.
[22:51:21] <tabakhase> (consider using reg to skip the unpacking on the daemon  https://github.com/genuinetools/reg )
[22:51:35] <DoofusCanadensis> docker can't log into more than one repository at a time?
[22:51:55] <zumba_addict24> what do you mean?
[22:52:09] <tabakhase> and if your issue is more CI  or builds in the LAN in the office, consider setting up a pull through cache instead -> https://docs.docker.com/registry/recipes/mirror/
[22:52:11] <zumba_addict24> the error I remember is "you've reached your rate limit"
[22:52:44] <zumba_addict24> the devs build nightly jobs
[22:53:20] <zumba_addict24> so I guess, anyting that is accessed a lot, we can put it in our existing internal registry(artifactory)
[22:53:50] <DoofusCanadensis> you add your account to artifactory and have it do the image pulls for you
[22:55:39] <zumba_addict24> what about the FROM line in every Dockerfile in the projects?
[22:56:47] <zumba_addict24> for example, FROM node:latest, and docker login is currently to our Artifactory. I just hope it knows where to pull it
[22:56:53] <tabakhase> if you mirror, you have to change them (use build args to prefix for example) -- pull through cache is a deamon-setting so nothing needs to be changed
[22:57:21] <zumba_addict24> is docker login not enough?
[22:57:33] <minimal> zumba_addict24: "FROM node:latest" makes no sense in that situation - the docker image you copy now and the one you copy in 10 minutes time may be completely different
[22:57:45] <tabakhase> docker login does literally nothing more but writing a json file
[22:58:07] <minimal> i.e would that be for instance version 1.2 of node? or version 1.2.1? or version 1.3?
[22:58:13] <zumba_addict24> Got it. Please help me since I'm confused on where to do the changes the best
[22:58:42] <zumba_addict24> so in Artifactory, I think I can find the username/password settings. However, i'm confused on the Dockerfile of users
[22:59:05] <tabakhase> dockerfile aint got nothing todo with auth
[22:59:06] <minimal> zumba_addict24: you should be using version numbers, not "latest"
[22:59:23] <statusbot1> Status update: The incident has been resolved. Some images pushed during this period may not appear in repository listings. Please re-push those images with a new tag. -- https://status.docker.com/pages/incident/533c6539221ae15e3f000031/61f42ab9b599c8052dc4cb2f
[23:00:07] <zumba_addict24> so tabakhase, that means, their FROM node:14.16.0 will remain like that but how will it know that it must pull it from our Artifactory instead of Docker Hub?
[23:00:31] <Flash> the registry is part of the name. Only DockerHub is implicit, and this cannot be changed
[23:00:39] <DoofusCanadensis> read Artifactory's documentation on how to set things up
[23:01:00] <tabakhase> zumba_addict no, only pull through cache allows to keep "FROM node" - anythign else needs "FROM myrepo.com:5000/node" or whatever it may be
[23:01:13] <Flash> so, FROM artifactory.yourco.com/docker/node:15.16.0
[23:01:36] <zumba_addict24> ah, I thought you said that developers doesn't need to do any changes
[23:01:57] <tabakhase> [20:26:53] <tabakhase> if you mirror, you have to change them (use build args to prefix for example) -- pull through cache is a deamon-setting so nothing needs to be changed
[23:02:00] <tabakhase> is a & b
[23:02:03] <zumba_addict24> ah
[23:02:07] <zumba_addict24> missed it, cool
[23:02:16] <zumba_addict24> I will check out their documentation on how to set things up
[23:03:26] <tabakhase> guess "nothing needs to be changed" is more precisely a "nothing needs to be changed on the individual builds" - as its a onetime change to /etc/docker/daemon.json ;-)
[23:03:38] <zumba_addict24> so i need to do 2 things. 1) Configure docker in Artifactory to use "docker id" 2) Inform developers to make changes to their Dockerfile(s) and point it instead to the internal one

[23:05:04] <zumba_addict24> Thank you all. I hope I got it right
[23:08:15] <tabakhase> "mirroring" is rly more a auditing/backups thing usually - for ratelimits/performance hosting a pull through cache in your LAN is neater  ((say, for things like gitlab-dind builds its massive too even on a single host/runner))

[23:27:46] <zumba_addict24> oh got it. I can build a new machine too for that

[23:50:39] <Tach> Is docker-compose not capable of creating a file which needs to be mapped ?
[23:51:28] <symb0l> Tach: You mean youre trying to volume mount a file that doesn't exist and want it to automatically create it?
[23:51:44] <Tach> symb0l exactly
[23:51:47] <symb0l> No
[23:51:55] <Tach> symb0l damn annoying
[23:52:37] <Flash> zumba_addict24: I abandoned docker mirroring on Artifactory; I only use it for our developed images. Also as a common practice, my Dockerfile has an ARG that defines the registry, so I can easily override it during image development
[23:52:54] <Tach> symb0l why not actually ? some -f tag on that line would have solved it
[23:54:40] <symb0l> I'm not a docker dev, no idea, I just know it doesn't :)
[23:55:05] <Tach> symb0l I hoped different but thanks :D
[23:55:18] <Tach> symb0l maybe there is a hidden option :P
