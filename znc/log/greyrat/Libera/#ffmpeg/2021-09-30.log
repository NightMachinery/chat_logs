[06:48:08] <i336> hi all, having a bit of an issue my google-fu isn't solving. I want to play with ffmpeg's motion vector visualization thingy... using a webcam. `ffplay -flags2 +export_mvs existing_file.mp4 -vf codecview=mv=pf+bf+bb` works 100% fine, but replacing `existing_file.mp4` with `/dev/video0` does not.
[06:48:42] <i336> the reason is fairly obvious: /dev/video is rawvideo, so there are no encoded motion vectors to analyze.
[06:48:59] *** Quits: arbitercoin (~Rheanna@101.91.197.175) (Remote host closed the connection)
[06:49:26] <i336> so, I'm trying to add a video encoding step so that the vectors are added, and having a really hard time figuring out how to do that.
[06:49:43] <i336> ffplay doesn't support any video codec options like -v:c etc.
[06:50:31] <i336> and I wasn't able to get `ffmpeg ... | ffplay -` to work either - while it introduced large delays anyways.
[06:50:38] <i336> (the motion vectors didn't show up)

[06:52:02] <i336> at the end of the day I'm looking for $anything that meets "realtime output without delay" and "shows motion vectors"
[06:52:14] <i336> eg, I know avidemux can do the second, but not the first
[06:52:33] <i336> (it would probably need to reencode anyway)

[06:53:04] <i336> just had a look at VLC, which... would need to do the same as well. so yeah. FWIW very interested in trying to figure this out, help much appreciated!

[08:57:10] <softworkz> @aphysically the problem with the XSDs for ffprobe is that they are correct in terms of XML logic and schema defnition, but they do not match the way how xsd's are usually designed when used for programming APIs
[08:57:54] <aphysically> well then I guess it's a good thing I wanted to make my own JSON one anyway
[08:58:39] <aphysically> I only had started looking at writing a parser for it, but I hadn't gotten too much into it
[08:58:56] <softworkz> a while ago I wanted to create C# objects for deserializing the json output
[08:59:15] <softworkz> I tried schema converters
[08:59:31] <softworkz> but didn't get very far
[09:00:05] <aphysically> JSD actually has projects that generate deserializers from a JSD description for a number of languages (C# included) https://jsontypedef.com/
[09:00:45] <softworkz> what I finally did was to use a Visual Studio feature where you can paste json and it generates classes from it
[09:00:58] <softworkz> not json schema - json data
[09:01:05] *** Joins: Huitzilopochtli (~ronnie@45.64.220.161)
[09:01:10] <softworkz> it required some cleanup of course
[09:01:29] <aphysically> (confusingly jsd isn't json scheme either, even if it's *a* json schema - I learned this the hard way this morning)
[09:01:45] <aphysically> in practice I've already written a sufficient deserializer for what I do in Python
[09:02:00] <aphysically> what I actually want to do is generate a typing stub for the deserialized object (:
[09:02:02] <softworkz> then I wouldn't waste time
[09:02:26] <softworkz> oh I though you'd have that already
[09:02:33] <aphysically> nah because python, basically
[09:02:57] <aphysically> python is weird with typing for static analyzers in complex cases like json, support only really shored up in the last release or two
[09:03:27] <softworkz> my conclusion from the earlier exercise:
[09:03:41] <softworkz> had I done it manually right from the start, I would have been faster
[09:04:37] <aphysically> yeah I *can* manually do it, right now I have a sorta stub stub that just says "allow all these things" in most cases

[09:04:56] <aphysically> I'm just allowing "Any" in a lot of places and declaring that the type stub isn't complete
[09:05:29] <aphysically> the schema file actually isn't as large as I thought it would be so it's not a herculean task to manually type it all
[09:05:53] <softworkz> that's what I meant
[09:06:02] <aphysically> right
[09:06:29] <softworkz> also, I'm using enums in many cases, I'm replicating AVRational, etc.
[09:06:41] <softworkz> that all requires manual work anyway
[09:06:49] <aphysically> I was going to replicate avrational, then I realized python stdlib's fractions.fraction actually worked fine
[09:07:11] <aphysically> actually I realized that *after* I replicated it
[09:07:17] <aphysically> but let's not mention that again
[09:07:23] <softworkz> one of the very few things C# doesn'T have
[09:07:49] <softworkz> IMO it's not worth dealing with the ffprobe xsd
[09:08:14] <aphysically> I can always type it incrementally too if I'm doing it manually (just type stuff as I use it)
[09:08:30] <aphysically> the static analyzer will catch anything I miss anyway
[09:09:53] <aphysically> softworkz: I still ended up replicating some stuff from ffmpeg's utility box anyway https://github.com/GBeauregard/pyffstream/blob/bd8d990df01086372b78ed274f8e97f75933596d/src/pyffstream/ffmpeg.py#L610-L644
[09:10:45] <aphysically> when this was a bash script I actually called ffeval directly :P
[09:11:04] <softworkz> why do you process units?

[09:12:15] <aphysically> nah, like if I'm transcoding based on what the user decided to encode the bitrate as so I don't try to transcode to anything of a higher bitrate e.g.
[09:12:37] <aphysically> and if I accept all bitrate format options that ffmpeg does, easiest thing was to just normalize the option to a number
[09:13:24] <aphysically> this is sent in side data to the server that uses it actually, it's not even used for the ffmpeg input

[09:16:23] <aphysically> yeah
[09:16:33] <aphysically> atto is after femto
[09:16:38] <softworkz> so da is atto*10 ?

[17:20:06] <Gaboradon> Bah
[17:20:18] <Gaboradon> FFMPEG again starts audio too soon for -c copy
[17:20:39] <Gaboradon> From a VP9+OPUS.webm to H264+AAC.mkv
[17:23:26] <another|> how is that stream copy?
[17:25:48] <Gaboradon> It's 15min long, I copied from 00:00:10 to 00:00:30, audio starts 4 seconds too early, MPV playbacks start when video starts and hard-ignores the first 4 seconds of audio only, AV stays in sync, however, Handbrake has an issue with it when converting, lenght of final streams are the same but Handbrake offsets the video when audio starts making the whole thing out of sync and useless.
[17:26:29] <furq> don't use handbrake then
[17:27:50] <Gaboradon> It's not HB's problem tho, that's just better mitigation of broken files from MPV's part
[17:28:19] <Gaboradon> Something HB can fix too

[17:45:53] <tar_xvf> Gaboradon: using -c:v or -c:a copy with timestamps is buggy. It has to do with things like video keyframes and things like that because it's a simple copy instead of re-encoding.
[17:47:54] <Gaboradon> So it's been like this for a long time?
[17:49:11] <Gaboradon> Thankfully davinci does support VP9 so I don't have to conver the whole 15 minutes, but it seems like FFmpeg's "official" GYAN builds do not have libfdk_aac

[17:49:54] <furq> it is also a gpl violation to distribute handbrake binaries with fdk
[17:50:01] <furq> so you should probably report that
[17:50:27] <Gaboradon> Because davinci has no OPUS or Vorbis import support so that's the highest quality codec, ... I can use PCM raw audio but IDK perhaps it makes my timeline laggy or what, I already use PCM in an earlier audio clip

[20:48:16] <tar_xvf> copying instead of re-encoding seems cool but is only good in very few configurations, such as when you don't do any cutting and just copy the whole stream from one file to the next.
[20:48:58] <tar_xvf> what I like to do is use really horrible but quick settings for encoding first while I do editing, and once I'm sure I will like the result then I turn up the settings and let it encode overnight or do something else on the computer
[20:49:31] <BtbN> You can cut just fine without re-encoding, as long as you are fine with somewhat inprecise cut points
[20:49:59] <tar_xvf> that is true

[21:44:00] <roxlu> I was just looking at some of the ffmpeg sources and wondering where the calls to `parse_packet()` is done for the avformat types? For example when reading data from a socket it's buffered somewhere and then passed into the parse_packet() function?

[21:53:08] <DeHackEd> parse_packet is all in avformat/utils.c where it's a static function
[21:53:42] <DeHackEd> it's mainly for formats where it's not obvious what the deliniation of a packet is. eg: video codecs largely expect a 1-to-1 mapping of a packet to a fully decoded frame

[23:52:08] <Bertl> greetings! I'm trying to figure out how to create .mlv files from raw data
[23:53:20] *** Quits: stevenliu (~stevenliu@ffmpeg/developer/stevenliu) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:53:28] <Bertl> in my case the raw data comes from two consecutive raw frames which need to be interleaved first, i.e. the first frame contains the even lines, the second frame the odd lines
[23:53:43] <Bertl> and then interpreted as raw bayer pattern
[23:54:45] <Bertl> is this somehow possible or does this need modifications to ffmpeg?
