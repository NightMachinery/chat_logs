[00:01:43] <mycroftiv> its like, we need to apply the mathematical processes of factoring a complex structure into simpler pieces to mathematical knowledge itself, because a lot of very useful concepts are gated by unnecessary prerequisite knowledge
[00:03:01] <riv> isn't category theory what does that?
[00:03:14] <mycroftiv> riv: it tries to do that but imo it fails really badly in practice
[00:03:20] <riv> sh
[00:03:22] <riv> ah *
[00:03:26] <mycroftiv> category theory confused me much more than it helped me for years, until recently
[00:03:47] <mycroftiv> nothing like trying to look up something on nlab and being dropped into utter concept spaghetti hell
[00:04:16] <mycroftiv> until i actually learned original motivations in algebraic topology and geometry for homological algebra it made very little sense
[00:04:49] <mycroftiv> even though i learned all the definitions of cats, functors, nat transforms, morphisms, prod/coproducts, limits, equalizers, topos
[00:04:49] <Z-module> "concept spaghetti", great name
[00:05:39] <mycroftiv> singular homology and its geometric/spatial meaning and chain complexes and abelian groups unlocked all this stuff

[00:16:28] <mycroftiv> [itchyjunk]: there is a structural logical relationship not capture by independent indexical 'D' and 'E'
[00:16:59] <[itchyjunk]> I don't understand what i not being captured
[00:17:06] <[itchyjunk]> the relationship of the variables somehow?
[00:17:10] <[itchyjunk]> like x or w/e ?
[00:17:35] <mycroftiv> [itchyjunk]: yes exactly
[00:19:36] <mycroftiv> its showing that expressing the 'is divisible by' relationship captures a logical relationship that the abstract variables without that additional decomposition of information does not
[00:20:11] <mycroftiv> (as well as the primeness predicate)

[00:55:06] <mycroftiv> its pretty cool, because unintended loops correspond to glitches in the logic, so detecting them finds potential indeterminacy from race conditions

[00:59:31] <[itchyjunk]> lol
[00:59:47] <mycroftiv> there are also too many different kinds of duality, Poincaré duality leads to Serre duality and Alexander duality and Verdier duality and Grothendieck duality and this isnt even touching Stone duality and...
[00:59:53] <[itchyjunk]> there is probably some unifying principle that can assimilate it all?

[01:00:37] <mycroftiv> [itchyjunk]: yes there are specific axioms for homology and category theory is kinda all about that. its because its easy to make up a new homology theory that there are so many
[01:01:18] <[itchyjunk]> I should learn the hello world of category theory at some point..
[01:01:19] <mycroftiv> you just have to find some useful way of constructing something abelian (group or ring or module or vector stuffs) from another thing that follows the chain complex rules
[01:01:26] <[itchyjunk]> enough to make sense of yoneda at least...
[01:01:50] <[itchyjunk]> oh commutativity is that important?
[01:02:10] <mycroftiv> yes because you need the kernels and cokernels and quotients to work how you want
[01:03:02] <biberao> can (1-P(B) * P(B) ) = P(A∩B) be true?
[01:04:06] <somiaj> if A = B = {}
[01:04:14] <somiaj> arg nevermind
[01:04:23] <biberao> sorry?
[01:04:44] <somiaj> I think you could make it true, but you would have to pick very specific A and B
[01:05:01] <biberao> ah i figured
[01:05:06] <somiaj> basically if you pick B such that P(B) = sqrt(0.5), then 1 - sqrt(0.5)*sqrt(0.5) = 0.5
[01:05:19] <somiaj> then pick A such that P(AnB) = 0.5
[01:05:23] <biberao> ah
[01:05:35] <biberao> but that would require very specific
[01:05:38] <somiaj> which is possible since sqrt(0.5) > 0.5
[01:05:45] <biberao> i was trying to prove this
[01:05:48] <biberao> https://imgur.com/zWB4DTZ
[01:07:23] <somiaj> And, I guess I don't see where 1 - P(B)*P(B) = P(A n B) comes into play here
[01:07:30] <somiaj> What you have there seems reasonable
[01:08:18] <biberao> somiaj: i know
[01:08:31] <biberao> but the guy who provided that exercise said that thing you mentioned
[01:08:37] <biberao> i solved it like i showed you there
[01:09:14] <somiaj> I'm still missing context then, but I don't think 1 - P(B)*P(B) = P(A n B) is true in general (partly because one side doesn't depend on A)
[01:09:42] <biberao> yes
[01:09:46] <biberao> thats what i thought too

[07:49:05] <sybariten> i'm struggling a bit to know where to even dig, or which nomenclature or area of probability i'm in here.
[07:49:37] <sybariten> for instance if this is one of those "order-matters"-problems, or if it's about permutations, or about combinations
[07:51:30] <sybariten> basically i have two groups of people, one has X number of people and one has Y number of people. I'm picking out five people randomly from both these groups. My goal is to calculate the probability that in my chosen set of five, there were 2 guys from the X people, and 3 guys from the Y people
[07:51:56] <MsSmith> wait no n & ( 2^n << 1)
[07:53:02] <biberao> anyone could explain me how -cos(2x)/2 +C = sin^2(x) +C?
[07:53:10] <somiaj> groups of people don't usually consider the order you pick, so combinations seems useful here.
[07:53:27] <somiaj> biberao: the constant is different, so don't call it both C
[07:53:44] <somiaj> otherwise than that use the half-angle formula for sin^2(x) or double angle formula for cos(2x)
[07:54:07] <somiaj> for antiderivatives, they just have to differ by some consant, but if you find the antiderivative in two different ways, you may end up with a different constant, which is fine.
[07:54:20] <biberao> ok will try thanks!
[07:54:48] <sybariten> somiaj: hmm ok
[07:55:16] <somiaj> sybariten: and by guys, I'm assuming you mean people, or they are all guys.
[07:55:41] <sybariten> this must be something like pulling x numbner of cards out of a deck and then solving some question about having y amounts of clubs and z amounts of somehitng else etc...
[07:55:44] <somiaj> sybariten: but really how many possible groups can you chose from X+Y people. How many groups can you chose such that you take 2 from X people and 3 from Y people. Take the ratio.
[07:55:54] <sybariten> somiaj: haha yes i meant guys in the wider term where also gals are guys  ;)
[07:55:55] <MsSmith> n & ( n << 1 )
[07:56:05] <biberao> somiaj: so the 1 of the half angle of sin^2(x) is the "C"?

[07:56:32] <somiaj> biberao: well it is just a constant. The easier way is to take the derivative of both sides and see they equal the same thing
[07:56:52] <biberao> ah i didnt know about this
[07:57:03] <sybariten> somiaj: yeah your second quetion is harder hehe
[07:57:04] <somiaj> biberao: the issue is two antiderivatives have to differ by a constant, so if you want to check if two functions are antiderivatives of the same function, you only need to show they are equal up to some constant.
[07:57:20] <sybariten> the "favorable" cases
[07:57:21] <somiaj> sybariten: It really isn't since the choices are indepdent, C(X,2) * C(Y,3)
[07:57:23] <biberao> like i was just solving the integral and went to a calculator and it gave me sin^2x+C

[08:06:29] <somiaj> so int cos(x) dx = int sin(pi/2 - x) dx = cos(pi/2 - x) + C, but how can the antiderivative be both sin(x) + C and cos(pi/2 - x) + C, though of course sin(x) = cos(pi/2 - x), so this works out nicely

[08:09:51] <somiaj> I always enjoy the example int x*sqrt(5-x) dx, take this antiderivative in two different ways (a) with parts, (b) using u-sub.
[08:10:02] <biberao> ok
[08:10:07] <biberao> tomorrow ill do it
[08:10:15] <somiaj> When you do this the answers do not look the same, so then you have to ask yourself why are the answers the same.
[08:10:34] <somiaj> And again realize they only have to be equal up to a constant
[08:11:19] <biberao> somiaj: can u sub and by parts be noticeable that you dont confuse when to use one or the other?
[08:11:36] *** Joins: smallville7123 (~smallvill@cpe-172-193-72-46.qld.foxtel.net.au)
[08:12:07] <somiaj> In general many examples can be done in multiple ways
[08:12:40] <somiaj> Unforuntally with antiderivatives, there is no clear set of rules (like derivative rules) that work in all cases. There are patterns and experience can help you notice them, but sometimes the only way to know if a method works is try it
[08:12:53] <biberao> ok cool thanks
[08:12:54] <somiaj> since all u-subs and parts do is take the original problem and turn it into a new problem you hope is easier.
[08:13:08] <biberao> at the high school level
[08:13:24] <biberao> i dont know the name
[08:13:24] <somiaj> So you can always try u-sub, but if you can't produce a simplier integral it might not work. Same with parts, you can always try parts, but unless the new integral is easier to deal with it may not be useful
[08:13:26] <biberao> example
[08:13:49] <somiaj> Parts is sometimes written as int u dv = u * v - int v du
[08:13:51] <biberao> Int 1/(x-1) so its ln|x-1|

[08:14:01] <biberao> what is it called?
[08:14:17] <sybariten> somiaj: i will look more at this tomorrow, but thank you!
[08:14:23] <somiaj> What makes an antiderivative correct is if you take the derivative you get what you started with
[08:14:34] <somiaj> so d/dx ln(|x-1|) = 1/(x-1) * 1 = 1/(x-1)
[08:14:48] <biberao> right
[08:14:49] <somiaj> If you are able to just guess the answer or see how to use a rule in inverse, you have the answer
[08:15:06] <biberao> what is called
[08:15:07] <somiaj> so int 3/(4-5x) dx = -3/5 * ln( |4-5x| ) + C
[08:15:08] <biberao> elementary ?
[08:15:20] <somiaj> I call that elementary with a linear inside
[08:15:26] <biberao> ah ok
[08:15:32] <biberao> we call it immediate primitives
[08:15:39] <biberao> so i was wondering the name in english
[08:15:41] <somiaj> really int 1/x dx = ln |x| + C is elementary, but int 1/(x-1) dx isn't, you could do it with u-sub, i.e. u = 1 - x
[08:15:50] <biberao> right
[08:16:02] <somiaj> immediate primitives is probably a bit better description
[08:16:24] <somiaj> since int sec(x) dx = ln(|sec(x) + tan(x)|) + C could be called elementary
[08:16:56] <somiaj> since elementary just means the antiderivative of an 'elementary' function, which are things like x^n, sin(x), cos(x), tan(x), sec(x), e^x, ln(x)
[08:17:01] <biberao> i see
[08:17:16] <somiaj> this is just the classification of the basic functions we use regurally

[08:17:46] <somiaj> Most people in the standard precalc->calc sequence are mostly use to formulas which are finite combinations of elementary functions
[08:18:06] <biberao> ill send a pic tomorrow
[08:18:13] <somiaj> so saying an antiderivative is elementary, just means it was of one of the elementary or base functions, but as you saw the antiderivative of sec(x) isn't that simple
[08:18:21] <somiaj> so thus I do think immediate primitives is a better description

[08:18:37] <somiaj> I won't stop calling them elementary, but I do like that description better
[08:19:23] <biberao> thats high school stuff
[08:19:27] <somiaj> some may also call int 1/(1+x^2) dx = arctan(x) + C elementary since it is an antiderivative that results in an elementary function that people maybe use to
[08:19:35] <biberao> right
[08:19:40] <biberao> thats elementary too
[08:20:04] <somiaj> I usually don't like classifying things has highscool stuff or college stuff. This can vary a lot for people. It is just the standard pre-calc -> calc sequence that is fairly commonly taught
[08:20:48] <somiaj> It shouldn't matter when you learn it, and I think classifing things as highschool isn't helpful to those learning it later in life
[08:20:58] <biberao> i meant for me

[08:23:29] <somiaj> your sin (sen) looks like sec so I'm always confused. Have to get use to it
[08:23:49] <biberao> its the translation
[08:23:55] <biberao> in books its sin now though
[08:24:00] <biberao> sen = seno
[08:24:02] <biberao> cos =cosseno
[08:24:11] <somiaj> Yea, I know sen is common, but the way you write it I can't clearly see that last letter and it does look like sec

[08:27:04] <somiaj> int 1/x^2 dx = int x^(-2) dx = 1/(-1) * x^(-1) = -1/x + C

[08:28:21] <biberao> correct
[08:28:30] <biberao> then i got confused somewhere
[08:28:57] <biberao> we got 2) P u'/u = ln|u|

[11:28:14] <riv> what is (2*pi)/100 ?

[11:30:45] <SineConfusesMe> so i  graphed my sine wave: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/9frfwtkq4s  in it the 10hz falls within 2*pi. i'm not sure what this is called but in my head i think it's the length of the wave (i know thats incorrect cause i believe sine wave is endless). i took that length and divided it by the number of samples i needed
[11:30:49] <SineConfusesMe> which was 100
[11:30:57] <riv> wavelength
[11:31:17] <riv> one wavelength is pi/5
[11:31:28] <riv> which is 2 pi / 10
[11:31:48] <SineConfusesMe> that's also the period right?
[11:31:53] <riv> yes
[11:32:33] <riv> so you sample at 10*100 Hz = 1 KHz
[11:32:40] <riv> that's the same rate
[11:33:14] <riv> and the delta time between samples would be 1/1000 seconds
[11:33:26] <riv> 2 pi doesn't seem to come into it for some reason
[11:33:36] <riv> I think your graph is wrong
[11:33:47] <riv> y = sin(10 x) is not a 10 Hz wave

[11:35:17] <riv> y = sin(x) has a period of 2 pi

[11:35:30] <MsEmilyFox> @op
[11:35:36] <MsEmilyFox> @ops
[11:36:16] <MsEmilyFox> anyway, SineConfusesMe you're on the right track!
[11:36:28] <SineConfusesMe> riv okay lets say we talk about simple y=sin(x). in my graph it takes 2pi to do one cycle
[11:36:46] <riv> for some reason desmos is graphing this wrong
[11:36:49] <SineConfusesMe> but i dont need my x-axis to be....pi ... i need it in seconds
[11:37:14] <riv> ah my mistake
[11:37:20] <riv> y = sin(x * 2pi) has a period of 1
[11:37:32] <MsEmilyFox> you can always scale your x-axis to be y = sin(x * 2pi) has a period of 1
[11:37:39] <MsEmilyFox> it's called radians
[11:37:40] <MsEmilyFox> haha
[11:37:52] <riv> and y = sin(x * 2pi * 10) is 10Hz
[11:38:18] <MsEmilyFox> basically you multiply by *2pi which is a complete circle
[11:38:26] <MsEmilyFox> @ops
[11:38:32] <MsEmilyFox> please ban riv
[11:38:36] <riv> 'x' is time in seconds
[11:38:41] <riv> y is height of the waveform
[11:38:53] <MsEmilyFox> riv: radians have no units
[11:39:01] <MsEmilyFox> 2pi doesn't have units
[11:39:29] <SineConfusesMe> wait wait i think im with you
[11:39:38] <MsEmilyFox> !ops
[11:39:40] <MsEmilyFox> !ops
[11:40:46] <SineConfusesMe> so in the case of desmos, my x-axis is in pi, which has no units like MsEmilyFox said so i can do my time * 2pi for a single cycle which will make my x-axis units to equal my time units
[11:40:56] <SineConfusesMe> MsEmilyFox does that align with what you were saying as well?
[11:41:03] <MsEmilyFox> yes!

[15:08:56] <riv> yes if A = B then A = B (mod m)
[15:09:27] <riv> why is this true? because you can apply a function to both sides of an equation to get a new equation, you can see this as applying a 'mod m' function to both sides
[15:10:34] <bailsman> I thought so but then I'm confused about this: 20 * 9 - 20 * 19 / 2 = -10 but 0 (mod 20) != -10 (mod 20)
[15:11:04] <riv> what is the equation
[15:11:21] <riv> -10 = -10
[15:11:27] <riv> you have to calculate the left hand side first
[15:11:36] <bailsman> left hand size is 0 (mod 20) no?
[15:11:39] <PlanckWalk> Division isn't the same modulo
[15:11:54] <riv> you can do
[15:11:56] <riv> (20 * 9 - 20 * 19 / 2) mod 20
[15:12:00] <PlanckWalk> Yep
[15:12:13] <riv> but you can't do  (20) mod 20 * (9) mod 20 - (20) mod 20 * (19) mod 20 / (2) mod 20
[15:12:16] <bailsman> Oh you can't reduce partways because there's a division
[15:12:25] <riv> do you see the difference?
[15:12:39] <bailsman> if I clear the denominators first then I can do it

[19:49:58] <thiccdaddy> more specifically: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectile_motion
[19:50:11] <thiccdaddy> it seems i'd need to know some calculus to understand that to a working degree

[19:51:32] <thiccdaddy> oh i see
[19:52:13] <isekaijin> v_{0,x} and v_{0,y} simply mean the x and y components of the vector v_0.

[19:52:47] <thiccdaddy> is that LaTeX notation ?
[19:53:02] <isekaijin> Yeah.
[19:53:06] <thiccdaddy> neat
[19:53:34] <isekaijin> Math notation can be inconsistent like that. The subindices 0 and x do not serve the same purpose. Moreover, neither is an index into a list.
[19:53:48] *** Quits: incon (~incon@173-25-124-159.client.mchsi.com) (Remote host closed the connection)
[19:55:20] <isekaijin> In a computer program, you would probably have something like “struct point { double x, y; } v0;” and then use “v0.x” and “v0.y”.
[19:55:36] <isekaijin> (Assuming your language is sufficiently C-like. Otherwise, adjust the syntax accordingly, of course.)
[19:56:27] <thiccdaddy> hrmmm, i see
[19:59:09] <thiccdaddy> I think he used that notation because in the problem, x and y have different velocities and rules. so they're technically separate but not really? i dunno vector math so i'm not sure. the 0 refers to the starting velocity at 0,0, for x and y
[19:59:29] * thiccdaddy glazed eyes
[19:59:49] <isekaijin> The subindex “0” just means “initial”.
[20:00:08] <thiccdaddy> oh ok
[20:00:30] <thiccdaddy> ohhh ok
[20:00:43] <isekaijin> It is a common convention in physics, and also in some parts of math where you also work with processes happening in “time”.
[20:01:15] <thiccdaddy> right, like in this problem
[20:01:18] <isekaijin> Yup.

[21:09:23] <lok91> But how do they determine the appropriate transformation?
[21:11:05] <lok91> How would you suddenly come up with u = x^2 + 4y^2 and v = y/x?
[21:11:41] <loadedanvils> The integrand of y/x makes one part of the transformation a good choice.
[21:12:31] <lok91> Hm... so we always use the integrand?
[21:13:36] <lok91> For one part?
[21:13:47] <Z-module> and the curve x^2 + 4y^2 = 4  as one part of the region boundary makes that LHS another good choice
[21:14:52] <lok91> So you always use the region boundary and the integrand for the two parts?

[21:19:13] <lok91> Yes
[21:19:28] <isekaijin> What I'm saying is - let's pass to “stretched polar coordinates”.
[21:19:46] <isekaijin> First we write the equation of the ellipse as (x/2)^2 + y^2 = 1.
[21:19:47] <loadedanvils> And y = 0, which implies a boundary by y/x = 0
[21:20:31] <isekaijin> Yeah, tan(t) = 2 (y/x) goes from 0 to 2.

[23:34:30] <vin> if top 15% of ratios (student:baseline) get 10 and top 30% get say 8. Then we are implicitly comparing students with each other (almost a competition) to say who did better than others.

[23:40:44] <vin> traxex: yes, but student's are okay to be compared with the baseline but don't like to be compared with each other. But you have a good point that it's essentially the same
[23:41:39] <joel135> You have to compromise *somewhere* between grading students independently and having their grades depend on the results of others. To avoid such a compromise is logically impossible afaict.

[23:42:45] <isekaijin> It's an education/pedagogy/whatever one.

[23:44:12] <vin> lol one can prove a theorem here as well, but I am not seeking that
[23:44:16] <isekaijin> Also, even if in the end you have to come up with a formula, you have to decide whether your formula is “good” based on completely non-mathematical considerations.
[23:44:41] <joel135> Why don't you include a special case which simply says that at least the student with the best results will get a 10? That seems like the least competitive variation of just having a single ratio threshold.
