[01:56:06] <Dan39> arch is like gentoo but better
[01:56:07] <babyface> I'm not anti debian though

[01:58:59] <phogg> tell me and I'll give you an alternative
[01:59:04] <Dan39> when you say "a server" i think like hosting a webserver, fileserver, etc. but a VPS is usually just a VM you pay for

[01:59:52] <phogg> duuude: GUI sql admin tools exist
[01:59:59] <phogg> not sure what specific features you want
[02:00:09] <phogg> is being RDBMS-agnostic important to you?
[02:00:43] *** Joins: chives (~chives@64.130.100.177)
[02:00:56] <phogg> when I want a GUI tool I use pgadmin4, because it works for Postgres, and when you're not able to use PG you're not able to live properly.
[02:01:29] <duuude> phogg: Idk someone asked for alternatives to to that and I asked here
[02:01:33] <duuude> what about mysql?

[13:13:58] <bparker> for example surveillance models are made for drives that just write 24/7
[13:14:12] <bparker> NAS is more of a mixed usage

[16:05:54] <tirnanog> wedwards: at best, it can be parsed as a simple command. let's take somecommand out of the picture. this would be dangerous: $(echo "rm with valid but dangerous args). it would be word split, then seing as the first word is rm, it would be treated as a valid "simple command".
[16:06:42] <tirnanog> wedwards: if you double quote it, it will still be treated as a simple command but will almost certainly result in a complaint of command not found because the entire expansion is treated as a single word, and there won't be a command by that name.

[16:07:51] <tirnanog> wedwards: anyway, yes, do quote. you have the right idea in general.
[16:08:04] <wedwards> tirnanog: Alright. Like I said, I'm just testing behaviour of quotes of different shells. My fictional use case is where I have /usr/bin/dostuff1.0 and /usr/bin/dostuff2.0, and the user runs /usr/bin/dostuff$(cat someversion.txt) - where someversion.txt should contains either 1.0 or 2.0.

[16:10:51] <tirnanog> wedwards: that would be bad code, for sure. here's an example. someversion.txt contains "differently *". you end up with two words, which are "/usr/bin/dostuffdifferently" and "*". the shell recognises the second of these as a glob so tries to expand every pathname in the current dir as additional words.
[16:11:45] <tirnanog> the shell finally treats all of that as a simple command, attempting to run /usr/bin/dostuddifferently, with either '*' as an operand or one of more pathnames that existed.
[16:12:25] <tirnanog> double quotes prevents that. instead, it would try to execute '/usr/bin/dostuffdifferently *' (and almost certainly fail, as there's nothing named 'dostuffdifferently *' in /usr/bin).

[16:14:07] <stdInOut> run*
[16:14:15] <tirnanog> wedwards: but even with that, if looks kind of dodgy. you might instead consider beginning with read -r version < someversion.txt, sdoing a basic sanity check on the results before tacking on "$version" to the simple command name.
[16:14:39] <wedwards> tirnanog: yes, and maybe checking if someversion.txt is even a regular ASCII, UTF-8 encoded file
[16:14:39] <tirnanog> I wouldn't just blindly expand entire files in a way that can influence command names.

[18:40:16] <fabricio7p> Hi, i just bought a stupid gaming laptop and learned that its builtin high refresh rate panel is not fully supported (locked at 60hz).
[18:40:29] <fabricio7p> Theres a archwiki page about it and it states "no workaround" https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Alienware_M15_R6
[18:40:45] <fabricio7p> is that something that will eventually be fixed in the Kernel or am I hopeless here?

[18:42:52] <ayecee> but it's up to someone to implement it.

[19:20:25] <Iamthehuman1> hey this may be interesting for people to know: Seems Timeshift just will not restore to a LUKS encrypted partition, unless one somehow managed to put /boot on a non-encrypted partition. In case one _needs_ to restore there is a dirty workaround: Make a new unencrypted partition somewhere and restore there with Timeshift and it will work.

[23:20:47] <nova> best virt machine for linux is … ?
[23:20:55] <Guest8537> what virtualization system do you use?
[23:21:04] <nova> none thus far
[23:21:05] <Guest8537> at ChetManly
[23:21:06] <akik> ChetManly: if you'd be using qemu you can just tell it to use the image in the file
[23:21:48] <Guest8537> virtualbox works fine for me
[23:22:10] <Guest8537> some say qemu is good too
[23:22:18] <ChetManly> akik, yes qemu
[23:22:32] <nova> I was thinking about doing disk pass through but it's too annoying to set up on same drive. So, I am going to blow up my windows partition, extend ext4 part for linux and do all of my work in virtual machine and pray that hardware passthrough is good enough. bad idea?
[23:22:46] <akik> ChetManly: -drive format=raw,file=${HOME}/.qemu/ubuntu_20.04/ubuntu_20.04.img
[23:23:05] <nova> we run Visual Studio with two different frameworks, so it's very, very slow. bad idea to run that in virtual machine?
[23:24:06] <jb1277976> has anyone tried https://pypi.org/project/i3-instant-layout/ for i3 ?
[23:24:57] <nova> not a single person - not even the creator
