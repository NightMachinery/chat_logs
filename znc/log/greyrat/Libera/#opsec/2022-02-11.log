[02:21:04] <Joanna> It doesn’t matter who commits crimes it matters why they were allowed to happen. Unfortunately people have been duped into believing that punishing an endless supply of people who may or may not be guilty is progress. If punishment was a deterrent people would not have become “witches”...
[02:22:29] <Joanna> We would be better off if we accepted the fact that punishment doesn’t solve anything.
