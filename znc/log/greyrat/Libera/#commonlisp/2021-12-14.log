[09:13:10] <lisp123w> beach: The eye opener moment for me was thinking of touch typing -> Since most of VIM keys are single keystroke, it becomes similar to touch typing fast, whereas with Emacs, having to press control a lot slows things down considerably
[09:13:53] <lisp123w> For very minor movements, Emacs is better since you dont need to switch between Insert & Normal modes, so the best solution is to use both

[09:43:50] <beach> phantomics: One of my first complaints when I observe my students using Emacs, is that they overuse commands to move by character an line.  They are slow and/or "error prone" (missing the target), not because they are "clunky" to invoke, but by the unit of motion.
[09:43:51] <beach> Most often, it is better to use one of the commands for words (M-f, M-b, M-t in Emacs) or expression (C-M-f, C-M-b, C-M-t, C-M-a, C-m-e, etc.) or even a simple one like M-m.  So perhaps the people who desire commands for simple consecutive motions by character don't have access to, or they under-use more appropriate commands?
[09:44:38] <beach> lisp123w: Yes, I see.

[09:54:45] <phantomics> beach: I often do that as well, but those commands also have the problem of b, f etc. not being ergonomic. If it was M-h, M-l etc. to move from word to word that would be easier to remember
[09:55:36] <phantomics> And when I built a Web keyboard interface I took advantage of the keyboard abstraction providing keyup and keydown events to use letter keys as modifiers, so that way you can have many more modifiers than Ctrl, Meta, Super etc.

[19:47:14] <jackdaniel> (eval `(foo ,@your-list)) if you really must, but macros should be expanded i.e from other macros

[20:16:21] <Guest74> jackdaniel what if you have the list stored in a symbol known at compile time?  Macro within a macro?
[20:21:43] <jackdaniel> when the list is know at compile time then you could do (macrolet ((guest-74 () `(foo ,@your-list)) (guest-74))

[20:40:43] <mfiano> (list "bar" "baz") is a list of 3 elements when the macro sees it. You could handle this at macro expansion time.
[20:44:41] <Guest74> hm, and I guess I use quote, that'll probably be a problem on some implementations.   guess i'll figure it out when I actually figure out what I want the macro call to look like.
