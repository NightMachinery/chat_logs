[01:16:30] <the-count> I guess a better question would be, what is the proper way to use php-fpm? Stack Overflow indicates this is a common issue that maybe isn't solvable by package managers
[01:19:09] <the-count> fastcgi must be the way to do it, it seems like mpm_prefork is not meant to be threadsafe. That begs the question, why does it exist if it doesn't work
[01:19:13] <TinoDidriksen> But your problem has nothing to do with php-fpm. It's a mod_php issue.

[05:03:00] <Blondie101010> does it die or complete?
[05:03:43] <CoJaBo> It seems to completely die. There's some weird uffering going on too; anything printed gets eaten too when the limit expires, I hae to write files just to debug statement GAHH
[05:04:33] <CoJaBo> It's dying somewhere pretty deep, and not making much progress with random prints
[05:05:02] <Beam> Right
[05:06:14] <Blondie101010> keep going
[05:06:20] <Beam> So i've debugged some more. I'm allowing max 128 connections in apache, and i have 50 php-fpm threads. Some high traffic hits, and it's taking me 10+ secs to load a page - however it doesn't show up in php timing, only 0.1 sec - so it means it's while it's waiting for either apache connection or php-fpm
[05:07:29] <Beam> it doesn't add up though, if processing always takes 0.1 secs, even in parallel, max request in front of me would be 128-50 = 78. and should only take 0.15 secs or so to clear for my turn
[05:07:55] <Blondie101010> beam yes it's possible...  did you try increasing either limit?
[05:08:05] <Blondie101010> (one at a time)
[05:08:10] <CoJaBo> I'm doing the ticks/profiling thing, but I'm not finding the file it's dying in even adding it to all of them, so apparently I'm not adding it really to all of them. FML.
[05:08:32] <Beam> well firstly the 128 connection limit is an ip limit (all of this is a bad-bot issue)
[05:08:45] <Beam> i have more available apache connections
[05:09:22] <Blondie101010> hmmm, so you're getting 128 connections by a single IP?
[05:09:28] <Beam> yea
[05:09:50] <Beam> (yes i can just block the bot, but i want to find out why it's causing such a big issue)
[05:09:57] <Beam> it shouldn't
[05:10:04] <Blondie101010> if you have sessions running, you could seriously knock your web server
[05:10:21] <Beam> why?
[05:10:47] <Blondie101010> because many of its threads would be busy waiting for a after a darn session lock
[05:10:58] <Blondie101010> s/for a/
[05:11:08] <__adrian> sessions are backed by files by default. if you have many requests all trying to use the same session, they pile up waiting for each other
[05:11:12] <Blondie101010> and use a firewall
[05:11:26] <Beam> well a session lock is at session_start() - and i'm timing my full php processing time and it's never more than 0.1 sec
[05:11:42] <__adrian> that's sensible
[05:11:54] <Beam> so it can't be session lock trouble the way i see it
[05:11:55] <__adrian> less than .1s to try to open the session. then you wait.
[05:12:16] <Blondie101010> Beam:  try to time a script within PHP that calls sleep
[05:12:35] <Beam> huh? i time from beginning of script, before session_start(), until end of all processing?

[07:46:41] <Blondie101010> please show a line or two
[07:46:45] <Alex123> it is exactly my problem
[07:46:46] <Alex123> lol
[07:46:55] <Alex123> $getDate = new DateTime($storedDate, new DateTimeZone('UTC'));
[07:46:55] <Alex123> $getDate->setTimezone(new DateTimeZone('America/New_York'));
[07:46:55] <Alex123> $getDateString = $getDate->format('Y-m-d H:i:s');
[07:47:08] <Blondie101010> where is the timezone in that output?
[07:47:15] <Blondie101010> 'Y-m-d H:i:s'
[07:47:35] <Blondie101010> that's what I was talking about
[07:48:19] <Alex123> users are not gonna look it is -4 or -5 if they ask New york time zone
[07:48:37] <Blondie101010> not something to show the users, but a proper format
[07:48:55] <Blondie101010> you came here demonstrating you had a bug
[07:49:01] <Blondie101010> and it is now explained
[07:49:40] <Blondie101010> the only case where you don't need to absolutely store the timezone is if it's static, like UTC, but that's not ideal
[07:50:05] *** Quits: Rockwood (~Rocky@user/rocky) (Quit: The Time is Over)
[07:51:51] <Blondie101010> in practice, things like that are suitable for databases, and DB systems are capable of handling all that for you easily (once you learn)
[07:52:37] <Blondie101010> validate, normalize, store, proper output protection, output
[07:53:38] <Blondie101010> and on a modern architecture, the output part could actually be sent unconverted back to the JS client which would adjust it to the local machine's time
[07:53:43] <Blondie101010> that is commonly done
[07:56:01] <Blondie101010> so the JS front end receives a proper time record and adjusts its output based on time offset
[07:56:47] <Blondie101010> (because you can't directly ask the OS what timezone it has in JS)
[07:57:48] <Blondie101010> afaik
[08:00:00] <Blondie101010> Alex123:  maybe a simpler example is just looking at your computer time when there's a DST change....  it shows you what the DST change makes you expect, but that's not the format it stores internally, otherwise it would have the same problem you described and it would frankly be catastrophic to go back in time on many systems

[08:03:36] <Alex123> whenever user day light starts or stops the event time always stays the same
[08:04:14] <Alex123> 3pm daylight saving event will be 3pm not day light saving
[08:04:32] <Blondie101010> that seems wrong
[08:04:58] <Blondie101010> you need to keep the timezone or make it static, period
[08:05:01] <Alex123> why is that :) let's say you gonna meet your friend for coffee next week in New York at 3pm
[08:05:15] <Alex123> and day light happens
[08:05:26] <Alex123> do you now go at meeting 2pm because of day light?
[08:05:31] <Alex123> or still go at 3pm?
[08:05:51] <Blondie101010> there is no time jump
[08:06:04] <Blondie101010> storing that gives you flawed records
[08:06:08] <Blondie101010> that is your problem
[08:06:58] <Blondie101010> put everything in UTC and you'll never see this again

[16:56:46] <freeman_h> Hi guys this is running for ever. I am not sure why, the line 14 where is fetch gets the data already which is 56 results. the foreach works does. I think the issue is in line 27 but why?
[16:56:52] <freeman_h> https://kopy.io/MPzXq
[17:00:23] <Naktibalda> why do you use do while loop?
[17:00:36] <__adrian> ^
[17:00:43] <Naktibalda> I think that you missed $page++; inside loop
[17:00:50] <__adrian> also is $ids a list of ids? parameters don't work that way
[17:02:38] <__adrian> as for  while($logs),  pdostatement->fetchAll()  always returns an array.
[17:03:43] <Naktibalda> empty array evaluates to false
[17:04:09] <Naktibalda> if it ever becomes empty, running the same query many times returns the same result.

[17:30:11] <Northwoods> lol those are strange facts
[17:30:16] <Northwoods> rather surprising
[17:30:52] <Northwoods> Naktibalda, should a php developer go and learn javascript , phython or switch over to java ?
[17:30:55] <Northwoods> java or c
[17:31:05] <Northwoods> i think learning curve for java or c can be considerable ?
[17:31:06] <freeman_h> Naktibalda, thank you not sure what I need to do with that
[17:31:31] <Northwoods> c# has many jobs too , not sure about how well they are paid
[17:32:08] <Naktibalda> freeman_h: read responses above
[17:33:30] <freeman_h> Northwoods, automation is the way forward. leading languages are python, java and follow by the others. Machine learning is also in automation.
[17:34:21] <freeman_h> Northwoods, been learning python in my spare time has the pay for python dev is going higher and higher in the UK
[17:34:49] <Northwoods> freeman_h, wow !
[17:34:53] <Northwoods> thats good information
[17:34:55] <Northwoods> helpful
[17:36:28] <freeman_h> php dev jobs in the UK is dropping each year :( and to make anything above £35k a year you need to move into the manager role and has you know most devs dont really have people skills. We are like eggs with our feelings, however we sometimes dont think twice before we give it to people if are are pissed at their level of work :)
[17:37:39] <Naktibalda> 35k is a junior salary
[17:37:56] <Northwoods> junior php developer ?
[17:38:03] <Naktibalda> seniors should be making 70-80k by now
[17:38:15] <Northwoods> Naktibalda, is taht in UK ?\

[17:39:17] <freeman_h> senior is around £46k good luck finding a company for that in a php role
[17:39:42] <Northwoods> it is strange that a junior java developers get around 40-50k pounds
[17:40:05] <Northwoods> which is way higher than junior php developers
[17:40:19] <Northwoods> freeman_h, what about python developers ?
[17:40:26] <freeman_h> Northwoods, junior java dev here gets 30-33k
[17:41:13] <Naktibalda> I moved to UK in 2010 as a "software developer" for 40k, got raise to 53k in 2013, and was making about 58k before leaving in 2018. not even in London.
[17:41:17] <freeman_h> Northwoods, according to https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Salaries/london-junior-python-developer-salary-SRCH_IL.0,6_IM1035_KO7,30.htm its around £31k, on linkedin I saw from £30k
[17:41:34] <freeman_h> Naktibalda, contracting?
[17:41:57] <freeman_h> or full time role?
[17:42:00] <Naktibalda> same job, full time.
[17:42:45] <freeman_h> most php dev I know earn 50k+ are contractors with a day rate of £320-£450
[17:43:54] <freeman_h> I work in a public sector so my salary is not the best but I get 38 days holiday so I can't complain
[17:45:04] <Northwoods> what about node.js and react ?
[17:45:07] <freeman_h> Northwoods, if I had to pick which language to add to my list. I am currently doing python because of machine learning
[17:45:10] <Northwoods> are these required too ?

[19:49:50] <olle> Economical data, in this case, like who bought what product.
[19:50:06] <olle> If you decide to pull, the master server can have an API

[20:04:01] <judah> I dont know how sensitive the SaaS nodes are about having out-of-sync data, but the fewer "trusted copies" around the better
[20:05:06] <olle> judah: Cache on the master machine? Hm.
[20:05:23] <olle> No, on the nodes.
[20:05:39] <judah> Yeah, short-lived caches on the nodes would be my go-to
[20:05:47] <olle> With caching you might need a push-action to invalidate the cache :d
[20:06:03] <olle> judah: Short-lived like 1h?
[20:06:27] <judah> Depends on how often your data updates and how sensitive your application is to being out of sync
[20:06:38] <olle> Hm hm
[20:07:10] <olle> Maybe some customer said "we paid the invoice now, please remove the reminder" and then the data needs to be pulled
[20:07:17] <olle> Or we say, "It will be updated automatically"

[20:12:04] <olle> https://simplicable.com/new/pull-vs-push-technology
[20:13:53] <judah> Typically its also easier to program the nodes to pull from the master, rather than program the master to push to the nodes. Less moving parts, less things to go wrong
[20:14:04] <judah> but its super dependent on your use case too
[20:14:30] <coreyl> a socket server would push or emit from the master to connected nodes/clients.
[20:14:50] <coreyl> Much in design seems to emitt from hub to nodes.
[20:15:07] <olle> Yeah, that's I'm considering to change our system from push to pull. It's getting silly.
[20:15:09] <coreyl> Why it was called master -- slave.
[20:15:10] <olle> why*
[20:15:45] <olle> But maybe different caches for different types of data would be equally complicated.
[20:17:55] *** Joins: ge (~g@37.214.44.116)
[20:18:23] <judah> Thats an idea, a socket server. The master could host a server that each of the nodes connect back to, and the master can publish updates to its dataset there. Best of both worlds, or possibly the worst, the rest is up to you
[20:19:20] <olle> Not sure that works, our SaaS is a little bit like Wordpress hosting.
[20:21:27] <coreyl> It would work olle.
[20:21:38] <coreyl> I've created similar.
[20:21:45] <olle> Well, hard to see how complexity would decrease :)
[20:22:22] <judah> We dont do things the easy way around here
[20:22:36] <judah> well, I dont at least
[20:23:09] <olle> We wanted to delegate a task to a new guy today, and it seemed so complex everything
[20:24:01] <olle> "The accounting system event pushes to master database, the master cronjob pushes to node, then node cronjob updates..."
[20:24:04] <olle> wtf
[20:24:32] <stenno> questioning of ones own infrastructure usually happens when you have to show it to someone else :P
[20:25:26] <olle> mm
[20:25:45] <olle> pull data and push cache invalidation.
[20:25:46] <olle> bah
[20:28:21] <judah> The simplest solution I can think of is to have an API endpoint on the master application that returns a timestamp of the most recent update. On each node you would have a cron job to poll this endpoint, and if the master copy is newer than their own copy then re-sync
[20:28:44] <judah> That would be pretty low overhead on the master, just a simple "select max(updated_at)" or however
[20:29:42] <olle> Idk, we gain customeres every month almost
[20:29:59] <olle> You could poll a replica tho
