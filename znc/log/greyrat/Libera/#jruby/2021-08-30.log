[20:27:12] <headius> Good morning! Back in the saddle
[20:39:36] <headius> demon36 It has been a very long time since that was built on Windows. We will need to figure it out again
[20:43:28] <basshelal[m]> Morning headius 
[20:43:28] <basshelal[m]> Have you found a good CI that can aid in building (and testing) for multiple platforms? Ideally be free, but if it's cheap we can set up a GitHub sponsor and I'd be willing to donate to help
[20:45:04] <basshelal[m]> I think the major platforms we would want are:
[20:45:04] <basshelal[m]> * GNU/Linux x86_64, aarch64
[20:45:04] <basshelal[m]> * Darwin x86_64, aarch64
[20:45:04] <basshelal[m]> * Windows x86_64
[20:45:49] <basshelal[m]> The more exotic platforms will be much trickier to deal with, we may need help from the community for those
[20:46:52] <headius> basshelal Not really. GHA does have Windows and  Linux (Ubuntu I believe) but no Darwin. I have an M1 Mac mini here I would set up for that but we have users on BSD, Solaris, exotic Linux like zLinux, and so on
[20:47:30] <headius> The jffi GHA has a Docker/qemu build now for several Linux platforms but we do not save the binary
[20:48:09] <headius> In theory something similar could be done for at least the other open platforms
[20:48:49] <headius> As demon36 pointed out to me it may be sufficient to build for as many platforms as we can and then call on the community for help
[20:50:45] <demon36[m]> idk how to mention ppl in that thing, morning headius & basshelal, I eventually succeeded to build it on windows with a mix of cygwin and msys2's mingw, might write an instructions markdown
[20:51:06] <demon36[m]> there is standing PR for jffi now, here : https://github.com/jnr/jffi/pull/112
[20:53:57] <headius> demon36: excellent... I will look into that and jnr* update releases today
[20:54:36] <headius> enebo: related to this... now that I have a mac mini we can use for builds and testing I will likely be ditching the MBP in favor of a more capable Linux machine
[20:54:59] <enebo[m]> EPYC
[20:55:17] <headius> hopefully the red hat options are decent
[21:18:27] <basshelal[m]> headius: I wonder if you can build and test using virtual machines/docker for the more exotic OSes on a Unix host, so for Solaris and BSD x86_64 you can run a VM or docker instance with those OSes and have the build and testing process be done there. I am unsure, I'm not very experienced with this kind of devops-y stuff
[21:18:27] <basshelal[m]> If that *is* possible though then we have more platforms we can support ourselves, and the only problem would then be the obscure CPUs like PPC and mips etc
[21:19:55] <basshelal[m]> I don't know too much about all this, just thinking out loud but I'm willing to help as much as I can
[21:20:15] <headius> VMs will work for x86 on x86 or ARM on ARM but outside that we have to go to something like qemu
[21:21:00] <headius> the qemu rig on jffi could be adapted to other OSes but it basically uses qemu to boot a docker image so right now it only does Linux
[21:57:09] <headius> ok lunch bbiab
[22:02:16] *** Joins: lucerne (~lucerne@ip202.ip-51-178-215.eu)
[23:01:44] <basshelal[m]> Well let me know if I can help with something. I have x86_64 GNU/Linux, Windows and Darwin and I can get a aarch64 GNU/Linux (raspberry pi 4)
