[03:03:16] <entuland> FunkyBob, that should be pretty much just the list of installed fonts on the system
[03:21:44] <entuland> there is some incomplete API to check the fonts loaded by a page and there is this proposal: https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/6234451761692672

[03:28:03] <FunkyBob> yeah, i found the api for listing and loading fonts... but that's only post-hoc fonts
[03:29:31] <entuland> that should only cover the fonts you actively load within your page - or any page if you check the list in the dev tools for any page
[03:30:15] <entuland> couldn't find any way to list the system fonts from the browser, not even via the dev tools - but of course that defeats the purpose as I could just check my own installed fonts
[03:31:57] <FunkyBob> seems an eternal problem
[03:32:07] <FunkyBob> and, sort of understandable... the list could potentially be huge

[03:52:52] <entuland> notice that libera.net is not libera.chat - check the records returned by that query
[04:04:17] <hassoon> nbjoerg: meh usually the famous 6667 irc port
[04:08:05] <nbjoerg> hm. *blink* why is firebug telling me that left/bottom don't have an effect for position: fixed ?!
[04:08:57] <entuland> are you forcing height / width somehow?
[04:10:21] <nbjoerg> no
[04:10:50] <entuland> odd
[04:11:12] <entuland> I tried to repro setting conflicting rules and firefox doesn't complain
[04:11:41] <entuland> https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/okbhvpjt/
[04:11:47] <entuland> can you share the offending scenario?
[04:12:16] <entuland> also, firebug? you mean the actual firebug or the firefox inspector?
[04:12:32] <nbjoerg> well, the latter
[04:12:37] <entuland> oh okay
[04:13:14] <nbjoerg> hm. doesn't happen in a minimal test case either
[04:13:51] <hassoon> firebug? i that still a thing ?
[04:13:59] <nbjoerg> ah! got it
[04:14:01] <entuland> nah, it was just a misnomer
[04:14:12] <entuland> what was it nbjoerg?
[04:15:03] <nbjoerg> https://jsfiddle.net/8f1dz7eo/
[04:15:49] <nbjoerg> the :after makes the difference
[04:16:32] <entuland> you were trying to apply fixed to the span without making it a block?
[04:17:04] <entuland> that sample is working fine on firefox / chrome
[04:17:06] <nbjoerg> well, the warning that says bottom/left are useless when they clearly are
[04:17:36] <nbjoerg> firefox 90, inspect element shows the two properties grayed out
[04:19:02] <entuland> with that exact fiddle? https://i.imgur.com/YSZnZcf.png
[04:19:19] <nbjoerg> which version is that?
[04:19:41] <entuland> 90.0.1
[04:19:58] <nbjoerg> hm. still have 90.0
[04:20:26] <entuland> you managed to hit such a freshly fixed bug? eheheh
[04:20:53] <nbjoerg> this is a pretty new feature, IIRC
[04:21:41] <entuland> which one? setting fixed on a pseudoelement?
[04:21:48] <nbjoerg> the optimisation hint?
[04:22:02] <entuland> oh
[04:22:16] <entuland> but then why am I not getting the same?
[04:22:20] <hassoon> https://i.imgur.com/biqOQuG.png
[04:22:34] <hassoon> FF 78 here anyway
[04:22:57] <entuland> are you looking into some other info panel in the inspector or the alike?
[04:23:26] <hassoon> nbjoerg: laybe your devtools is lagging
[04:23:37] <hassoon> nbjoerg: tried closing it, then reopening it ?
[04:23:52] <hassoon> maybe *
[04:23:56] <nbjoerg> https://www.netbsd.org/~joerg/Screenshot_20210722_015306.png
[04:24:00] <nbjoerg> that's what I am seeing
[04:24:01] <hassoon> FF sometimes does unreasonable lagging
[04:24:27] <hassoon> tried reopening your devtools ?
[04:24:37] <nbjoerg> I did
[04:24:41] <entuland> that doesn't seem like optimization stuff - those declarations are definitely getting applied
[04:24:53] <nbjoerg> I know, that's why I blinked :)
[04:25:13] <entuland> super odd
[04:25:17] <hassoon> nbjoerg: if you change the properties, does the ::before move actually ?
[04:25:31] <nbjoerg> ::after, but yeah
[04:27:49] <hassoon> nbjoerg: what if you change the position to static, then change it back to fixed ?*
[04:28:43] <nbjoerg> I think it is confused because the regular span is not positioned
[04:29:27] <entuland> but it's weird that it's not failing on both a way old version (hasson's) and on just an x.x.1 increase like mine
[04:29:40] <entuland> I'm tempted to download and install 90.0
[04:29:49] <nbjoerg> yeah or some other strangeness
[04:30:01] <nbjoerg> like mozilla shipping different versions of the dev tools on linux or whatever
[04:30:22] <entuland> win 10 here, yes
[04:30:34] <entuland> I guess you can try and download 90.0.1 and see if the problem disappears
[04:30:40] <hassoon> gnu/linux debian here
[04:30:42] <entuland> can't easily see how to get 90.0 myself
[04:31:11] <hassoon> entuland: that's in mozilla website
[04:31:21] <nbjoerg> not going to waste my time. if I am remembering it in a month, I'll retest
[04:31:21] <entuland> yeah trying to find it
[04:31:26] <entuland> there is a downgrade protection
[04:33:10] <hassoon> entuland: https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/
[04:33:46] <hassoon> entuland: https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/90.0/win64/en-US/
[04:33:59] <entuland> yep, found it after diving into their docs :P
[04:34:19] <hassoon> okey
[04:35:50] <entuland> nope, 90.0 en-GB works just fine here, that bogus warning doesn't appear

[18:23:35] *** Joins: Koopz (~Koopz@koopz.rocks)
[18:24:33] <Koopz> so i got background-color, opacity, background-image background-size and background-position. Is it possible to put all of these into a single "background" property?
[18:25:30] <Koopz> or is the shorthand only limited to -color, -image, -repeat, -attachment and -position?
[18:28:17] <entuland> craigbass76, can't tell, they're all complete 5-items rows for me (apart the last one)
[18:29:00] <entuland> Koopz, nope, there are more: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background
[18:29:01] <craigbass76> entuland: Yeah, I just changed them. If I set a height (25em looks like it works) and a max-width on the images, it seems to be fine
[18:30:10] <entuland> craigbass76, you should be using grid or flex, not floats
[18:30:57] <entuland> you should also be using the latest HTML, not that xhtml
[18:30:59] <craigbass76> entuland: everywhere, or just in those five-across divs?
[18:31:30] <entuland> floats should only be used to float images or equivalent in the context of text that needs to "wrap" around them
[18:31:42] <craigbass76> This site I'm redoing... It's last incarnation had a bunch of "if the browser is IE6" things in them. I've been out of the game a while...
[18:32:02] <entuland> okay
[18:32:29] <entuland> you can check on the latest intended techniques / features here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web
[18:32:41] <entuland> using grid / flex is going to simplify the layout a lot
[18:34:29] <Koopz> entuland would you happen to know a little tool that would help me convert those multiple css rules into a single background rule?
[18:35:14] <entuland> it's not like you have to
[18:35:30] <entuland> and actually, using separate declarations is clearer to read and maintain if you're using a lot of those
[18:36:03] <entuland> you can simply reorder them according to the order the shorthand list expects, and manually remove the names stashing them together
[18:36:06] <Koopz> well i kinda am forced to :D see there's this website where i can defined a custom background for my profile and it specifically only uses the background property
[18:36:21] <entuland> use jsfiddle to edit it
[18:36:31] <entuland> so that once you have it working right you can simply copypaste it
[18:36:57] <entuland> there may be tools to speed it up but if it's a one time thing, it's not worth even googling about it probably

[19:24:40] <entuland> if that's all you want to achieve and you're allowed putting base64 encoded urls, you may be better just creating that image and repeating it
[19:29:37] <entuland> something like this, badly cut: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/n7vuxLc4/
[19:30:30] <entuland> you can use this to convert the image: https://ezgif.com/image-to-datauri (the one I used to convert the above)
[19:31:15] <entuland> way simpler and faster (even as performance) than using gradients

[19:42:27] <entuland> as for joining them all, simplified to convey the point: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/0ovdwLgj/
[19:42:57] <entuland> you need to follow the instructions about the order and add the "/" separator between the posizion and the size, or the rule would become invalid
