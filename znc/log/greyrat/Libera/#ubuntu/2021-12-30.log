[02:33:29] <erbth> Kaedenn: depending on you usecase you might also like to have a look at apt-cache search (vs. apt search) - it has a more script-friendly (*stable*) output
[02:33:30] <Kaedenn> (manpages are your friends and you should use their friendship)
[02:33:44] <Kaedenn> erbth: ...they... aren't the same thing?
[02:33:51] <erbth> no, not really
[02:34:01] <Kaedenn> today I learned
[02:34:32] <erbth> from what i know, apt xxx are wrappers around apt-get and apt-cache that present more user-friendly output in interactive terminals
[02:34:34] <Kaedenn> my short-term goal: wrap apt-search to display results using one line per result, akin to prior versions of apt
[02:34:43] <erbth> (like a progress bar when installing software)
[02:34:43] <tomreyn> kexoni-mob: first finding, and this is usually graphics related, is "mtrr_cleanup: can not find optimal value" "please specify mtrr_gran_size/mtrr_chunk_size"
[02:35:06] <Kaedenn> however, I would not be surprised if there is already a feature to change (or condense) the output of apt-cache search
[02:35:37] <Kaedenn> heck, I could just use the machine-readable output format and parse *that*

[03:13:32] <Kaedenn> `update-java-alternatives.py /path/to/jdk1.8.0_301 1301` will update every alternative pointing into $JAVA_HOME to that
[03:14:03] <Kaedenn> there's another execution mode that assumes $JAVA_HOME is the new jdk and you specify the old one with -j or something

[09:11:06] <mjt> jehlow: i don't think that's the right way to use openvpn with systemd, you should copy the service file into /etc/openvpn and then use sudo systemctl enable openvpn@servicenamehere
[09:11:32] <mjt> i recommend starting from scratch and following one of many guides on the net
[09:12:46] <mjt> servicenamehere is the name of the client config (without .ovpn)
[09:13:12] <mjt> but I haven't used openvpn in a long time, you should use wireguard instead, it is a billion times easier including the systemd integration.

[09:44:20] <mjt> if it's not, then I suggest trying to configure wireguard instead ... which your vpn provider appears to support. it is much easier. also, it has an integrated killswitch so if the vpn connection drops you don't leak traffic.

[09:57:56] <jehlow> its where it should be in /etc/openvpn
[09:58:15] <mjt> it needs to be called ipvanish.conf - it doesn't really matter what you call it, but you must have the same name for the systemd service you enable.
[09:58:38] <mjt> you have run systemctl enable openvpn@ipvanish, so it follows that the config file must be called ipvanish.conf.
[09:59:12] <mjt> if you called it openvpn.conf, you'd need to run systemctl enable openvpn@openvpn which starts to get confusing

I've found this question: https://serverfault.com/questions/670423/linux-memory-usage-higher-than-sum-of-processes seems like the guy knows a lot more than me. Running his commands (rn I don't really know what they do) seems like most of my memory is used as 'kernel dynamic memory', so I'm researching that.
[14:18:58] <barnaba[m]> https://pastebin.com/v0prgjP4 here's my outputs anyway
[14:19:20] <barnaba[m]> if it was a program I was running I'd expect it to be in userspace memory, correct?

[17:10:15] <KBar> You're asking how to install something not supported. If something goes wrong, then what? Poor volunteers, Mark Shuttleworth and Linus Torvalds are at fault?

[21:41:16] <genii> !pin
[21:41:16] <ubottu> pinning is an advanced feature that APT can use to prefer particular packages over others. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PinningHowto

[23:19:19] <tstagg> Are you having an issue with the instructions you found from your search?
[23:19:52] <void09> tstagg: yeah I found 3 different sets of packages in articles describing the solution. some failed to provide the needed functionality (copy/paste between host/guest). That's why I wanted to check here
[23:20:05] <global_elites> is there a way to install 21.10 from the live iso without installing grub?
[23:22:38] <tstagg> void09: in the menu, do you have Devices -> Shared Clipboard -> Bidirectional set?
[23:22:48] <void09> yes,I do
[23:23:00] <void09> sudo apt install virtualbox-guest-dkms virtualbox-guest-utils virtualbox-guest-x11 - this made it work
[23:23:08] <tstagg> oh ok you got it working then
[23:23:10] <tstagg> good deal
[23:23:10] <void09> not sure if all necessary, but i won't bother investigate further
