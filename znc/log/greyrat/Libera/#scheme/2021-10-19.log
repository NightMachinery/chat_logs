[11:49:47] <zacque> I'm interested in studying the RnRS report to understand the langauge, but I'm not sure which version to read
[11:50:19] <zacque> It seems like R5RS is the safest bet since it's most widely supported by implementations?
[11:51:07] <zacque> However, I read that R5RS and R6RS are very different and are best treated as two different langauges?
[11:51:33] <sjamaan> zacque: There's a truth to that, which is why R7RS-small was meant to be an incremental improvement over R5RS
[11:51:58] <sjamaan> So you might be best off reading R7RS, as all active implementations seem to be (aiming at) supporting it
[11:53:46] <zacque> sjamaan: Ah, I see, thanks for clarifying
[11:55:44] <mdhughes_> Except that's not the case, the R6RS impls are not generally trying to move backwards.
[11:55:53] <zacque> sjamaan: Can I ask what's the relationship between R6RS and R7RS? Is R7RS an improvement over R5RS or R6RS?
[11:56:06] <zacque> sjamaan: R6RS seems like the elephant in the room
[11:56:35] <mdhughes_> R7RS is a regression with a very tiny amount of new stuff over R5RS, because a lot of R5 impls weren't capable/interested in adding R6 features.

[11:57:21] <zacque> mdhughes: Oh I see

[12:01:09] <mdhughes> The specs aren't a great way to learn the language, anyway. A book like TSPL4 (Chez) or HTDP (Racket) etc. will be more friendly.
[12:02:58] <zacque> mdhughes: Thanks, but these books are sometimes too verbose for me
[12:03:20] <zacque> mdhughes: I'll rather dive into the BNF grammar and then into its semantics

[16:00:34] <amirouche> studying both R6RS report and R7RS-small report and then the recent SRFIs will give you a VERY good grasp of the language
[16:02:05] <amirouche> That above is my take. Tho, It really depends what you want or what you need. If you want to study Scheme from a PL perspective, or as basis for an application.
[16:03:04] <amirouche> if you want to build an application that is a different discussion.
[16:03:59] <amirouche> if you want to get into Scheme programming, a Scheme crash course like https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/CHICKEN/
[16:04:14] <amirouche> or https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/racket/

[22:35:50] <amirouche> +1 for the test suite, +2 for adding CI to SRFI.
[22:36:00] <amirouche> +1 for the R7RS test suite, +2 for adding CI to SRFI.
[22:37:01] <amirouche> I think MNW aim for R8RS but that is not incompatible with R7RS?
[22:37:17] <Zipheir> No-one's keeping track of up/downvote counts in this channel...
[22:38:21] <amirouche> MNW meticulous work seems me favor the precise definition of every behavior, I may me mistaken about that particular rule, it is along the line of : "no unspecified behavior"
[22:38:26] <dpk> MNW's immediate goal is a revision of R6RS, afaik
[22:38:52] <amirouche> what about the MUST vs. SHOULD ?
[22:39:41] <Zipheir> I don't remember where it came up, but I recall MNW deploring the decision to make R7RS-large its own thing, and not built upon R6.
[22:40:00] <dpk> i (and, more importantly) jcowan think this is a good idea to promote unity between R6 and R7. i think he's mentioned the possibility of reunifying the community around an R8RS but i don't buy it. i think unity will be around implementations that compatibly support both R6 and R7
[22:40:06] <amirouche> that was IIRC a strong preference maybe even a rule of the steering comitee
[22:40:22] <Zipheir> Yes.
[22:41:06] *** Quits: aeth (~aeth@user/aeth) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[22:41:07] <dpk> well, WG2 is bound by charter to use R6 technologies when we can, but we arguably have different goals than R6
[22:41:58] *** Joins: aeth (~aeth@user/aeth)
[22:42:20] <amirouche> I mean to say, most of the streering commitee was made of people against R6RS, that is jcowan that is working to make R7RS compatible when possible
[22:43:24] <amirouche> and *against* R6RS is unspecified, is it because of the SHOULD vs. MUST, or is it a problem with the people / social problem.
[22:43:52] <dpk> (also, the fact that anyone can vote means in practice that whatever the WG2 charter says is moot if the votes come out different. and the steering committee can only respond to violations of the charter by firing jcowan, afaik (which they presumably know would be pointless); it is not possible to dissolve the people and elect another one)
[22:44:22] <amirouche> simply, said, I do not known the difference between R6RS and R7RS in the standards
[22:45:23] <amirouche> the vote machinery is win, given the nature of the -large part, we can not assume a handlful or dozen of skilled implementers to be know-all on all subjects that must addressed.
[22:45:48] <dpk> it's my understanding that the negative reaction to R6 from many implementers was basically, and quite reasonably, because R6's requirements for e.g. a specific exception hierarchy meant they had to choose between being compatible with their (in some cases quite large) existing users' codebases, or adopting R6
[22:46:12] <jcowan> And other things of the same sort, such as R6RS I/O.
[22:46:26] <dpk> well, i think the voting system is a semi-win. MNW's criticism of it is accurate
[22:46:35] *** Quits: aeth (~aeth@user/aeth) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[22:46:50] <amirouche> the consequence on the vote machinery, is that some people apparantly flee the boat because of that democratic process.
[22:47:04] <jcowan> Indeed.
[22:47:47] <dpk> i think allowing everyone to vote on portable libraries is a good idea. (for the same reason i think truly portable libraries should be mandatory for Large implementations: if you implemented small, you can get those parts of Large for free thanks to the sample implementations.) when it gets to the non-portable stuff i still have concerns that implementors should be heard a lot more
[22:48:15] *** Joins: aeth (~aeth@user/aeth)
[22:48:37] <jcowan> In practice, the alternatives to democracy are aristocracy (which degenerates to oligarchy) and monarchy (which degenerates to tyranny).  See Plato's Republic
[22:48:42] <Zipheir> Speaking of which, when is the vote on the Yellow ballot?
[22:48:59] <dpk> it's now
[22:49:09] <Zipheir> Where?
[22:49:14] <amirouche> that is their choice, and not the best choice, since they could voice their concerns and win people to vote for their proposal. They are against 'democratic principle' and to an extension 'learn people to fish'

[22:53:50] <dpk> i mean, do you think it would be oligarchical or tyrannical if non-portable features were subject to a bicameral or two-class voting system, where either they need both a majority of implementor support *and* user support, or where implementors' votes count for more?
[22:53:59] <jcowan> Thanks!
[22:54:24] <jcowan> I suppose it would be a mixed system
[22:55:05] <amirouche> implementers implement, users use, there must be a conversation.
[22:56:22] <jcowan> A standard is a contract between users and implementers, and contracts of adhesion (where one side gets to say "Take it or leave it") are generally Bad Things.
[22:57:01] <jcowan> In Scheme there are also so many implementations (about 80) that the boundary is fluid.
[22:57:51] *** amirouche is now known as amazigh
[22:57:58] <gwatt> I think language implementors are mostly in the position of being able to say "take it or leave it", especially when there is a single implementation
[22:58:22] <dpk> yeah, if there's no implementor uptake at all we might as well not bother
[22:58:35] <dpk> for individual features or for the whole thing
[22:58:40] <dpk> see: XHTML 2.0 ;-)
[22:59:30] <amazigh> not necessarly. idk XHTML 2.0. but Python did manage to create a good frontend, that implementers (pypy) tried to make it practicale 
[23:00:16] <dpk> (i also recognize my concerns about implementor uptake are not the only objections, or even the main objections, to the current voting process)
[23:00:41] <amazigh> I mean by that, CPython is mostly a specification a language that user like to use, and that the opposite of what R6RS tried to do.
[23:01:31] <dpk> but solving the main issue, the difficulty of being up to date on all the issues involved in a particular question, is trickier
[23:01:38] <gwatt> amazigh: If cpython decides to do or not do something, pypy has to follow. Python isn't technically a single implementation language, but it's the dominant by far
[23:02:09] <dpk> it's exacerbated by the fact that the arguments happen in lots of different places (i'm sure *i'm* not following all of them) over email
[23:02:48] <amazigh> yeah, but they focused mostly on users need and preference, unlike implementers needs (and it happens regularly on #pypy where they curse some cpython choices)
[23:03:58] <amazigh> I am not sure pypy people can vote or even propose Python's equivalent of SRFI called PEP
[23:04:28] <dpk> jcowan has a typology of programming languages somewhere based on specification vs implementation as the source of truth
[23:04:34] <gwatt> I think SRFIs are even less official than PEPs
[23:05:10] <dpk> Python is strongly on the side of implementation — there effectively is no complete specification other than how CPython behaves

[23:05:22] <amazigh> that's better than python bazaar, where everyone shoot in its direction with referencing prior work, or asking for feedback.
[23:05:24] <Zipheir> jcowan: So what happens if explicit renaming gets voted into Yellow?  Is the MIT Scheme implementation the preferred model for the standard?
[23:05:25] <dpk> Scheme is strongly on the side of specification. and i don't think anyone wants to change that

[23:06:23] <amazigh> I am in favor of the standard like Scheme does, but that should be done in a way that is open and up for debate and learning both sides, like right now
[23:07:24] <amazigh> implementers are not no-all, or even unbiased toward particular solution, especially since they have their own user base that they do not want to break backward compatibility.
