[03:38:43] <incal> o/ what is this warning? "secureboot: Secure boot could not be determined (mode 0)"
[03:39:36] <sney> the kernel can't tell if secure boot is enabled, sounds like (so it probably is not)
[03:44:18] <incal> OK, let's enable it and see what happens
[03:45:15] <sney> the info on this page is pretty accurate: https://wiki.debian.org/SecureBoot
[03:45:37] <incal> alright, thanks
[03:45:48] <sney> (I have been using SB on this system since before the bullseye release with no issues)
[03:46:06] <incal> but there's more, is there a page that explains these warnings?
[03:46:14] <incal> e.g., next one, "pci 0000:00:00.2: can't derive routing for PCI INT A"
[03:46:31] <incal> and (seems related) "pci 0000:00:00.2: PCI INT A: not connected"

[03:50:11] <sney> the 0000:00:00.2 in the pci warning looks like the bus location, so you could match that to lspci output to see what device corresponds
[03:50:16] <sney> it's probably low level stuff though.
[03:50:28] <sney> "error -2" is simply "file not found"

[03:56:23] <sney> !warning
[03:56:24] <dpkg> Yerp, lots of software outputs warnings.  Kernel module warnings on boot, possible missing firmware warnings, GTK warnings, X11 warnings, build warnings, gpg warnings.  Don't be scared - informative output is a GOOD THING.  Consider yourself warned, and if the program works as expected, be happy.
[03:57:00] <incal> programming C or Lisp I always correct the warnings :P
[03:57:08] <incal> !error
[03:57:08] <dpkg> user error at console, abort, retry, fail?  See also <doesn't work>, <errors>.
[03:57:27] <incal> !errors
[03:57:27] <dpkg> If you don't tell us the exact error messages you get, we can't tell you what's wrong, and it's also useful to know exactly what command you're typing.  Please look for the *first* error that occurs, as this is often the cause of later errors -- ask me about <localized errors> too.  Please don't paste in the channel, use a pastebin instead; ask me about <pastebin>.
[03:58:15] <incal> OK, not related
[03:59:32] <incal> errors, same attitude?
[04:01:03] <incal> seems to be related to three things: ACPI BIOS ("Could not resolve symbol"), kvm (disabled), nouveau (firmware)
[04:01:24] <sney> yes, it depends on whether something is actually broken
[04:01:41] <sney> nouveau is a video driver. it optionally uses firmware to enable some features. don't need them? don't worry about it.
[04:01:59] <sney> and I think it will print extra warnings about that even if it does have the firmware installed
[04:03:53] <incal> so it is, is it broke/not broke, you cannot get a slightly better system by fixing the warnings/errors?
[04:05:25] <sney> the vast majority of the time, if you go down a rabbit hole to deal with some boot message, you may learn some things about how linux works, but it will have no practical effect on your system
[04:08:42] <incal> okay, well, I'd be happy to read like one paragraph or so for each message, but if there is no resource for that (e.g. a web page) so you have to track down each one individually, maybe not worth it

[13:22:11] <jelly> kee, does this actually work for you, or is it just theoretical?
[13:22:33] <mmalter> darutoko: that idea sounds laughable. Sometimes, the world amazes me but I really don't see that happening. In any event, I don't think Debian can prevent anyone from using Debian, that's the beauty of it.
[13:23:07] <mmalter> darutoko: The day you see restrictions on the repo the streisand effect would be incredible.
[13:23:11] <jelly> my experience with PA and tcp support is computers on the same LAN announce their audio sinks and sources and can be configured on other machines with eg. pavucontrol
[13:23:30] <jelly> it's not tied to X11 or ssh -X

[13:24:46] <jelly> darutoko, Debian software is widely mirrored and distributed, you can't effectively prevent someone from installing and using it
[13:25:16] <mmalter> darutoko: Yes but tthey can do these sort of things because Huawei is a centralized institution. Debian is super robust against these attacks and I honnestly think they never tried.

[14:00:09] <Khepra> srsly tho, the trio has been in the core of unix permissions.  personally, I'd agree that DAC is too weak for 21st century situations and MAC should be made default.
[14:00:17] <labrador> oh ok
[14:00:28] <grolongo> Khepra: how do I set a random binary to be able to be executed by any user? while still being owned by root
[14:00:50] <Khepra> grolongo: by giving the binary the execute permission for "all".
[14:01:09] <Khepra> using chmod(1).
[14:01:36] <Khepra> you can also go beyond simple owner:group:all permissions on a file via ACLs

[17:36:23] <duckgoose> you brush that off but it directly contradicts what you're saying
[17:36:25] <kee> The peak RAM use is what matters.
[17:36:37] <kee> Not the RAM use after it's been running the garbage collector for several minutes.
[17:37:06] <duckgoose> so your issue is the ram usage while the browser is being heavily used?
[17:37:10] <Khepra> my FF now consumes 1.6G with 4 tabs open, and 201 hours of uptime
[17:37:18] <kee> Nope. Chrome eats memory when it decides it needs to pre-render some tricky CSS.

[17:44:29] <jelly> duckgoose, it's not one app, it's several at the same time, and it's hard to sum up actual usage for all the processes of a single electron app
[17:44:30] <duckgoose> it does not mean electron is bad
[17:44:55] <kee> Electron does in GBs what was once done in 10KBs.
[17:45:04] <duckgoose> this is all a lot of assumptions and misinformation

[17:45:49] <Khepra> I don't mind electron apps consuming RAM (if they do excessively, I don't know) I mind that they package so much dead code, that can still be exploited by virtue of being in VSS and accessible... entire browser in VSS just for a single hello world, even if it used, like 10kB, of rss for that
[17:45:55] <labrador> Electron is bad but not that bad...if properly designed
[17:46:16] <duckgoose> the reason people are using electron now is because GTK sucks so much
[17:46:19] <labrador> Like tutanota takes 140mb. I think thats fine. On the other hand teams can take 500mb on a good day

[18:19:30] <Khepra> usually you want to tell specific programs, not users, which CA stack to use

[18:22:19] <shibboleth> since nt
[18:22:30] <Khepra> because like I said, that's highly unusual use case. if anything, you want programs, not users, to be limited in CAs they trust.
[18:23:04] <shibboleth> yeah, but if a user trusts a ca then you won't have to patch software

We don't and cannot know what changes were made by your distribution (compare http://futurist.se/gldt/).  #debian only supports Debian and pure <blend>s; please respect our choice to volunteer here to help Debian users.  Support for other distributions is off-topic on #debian, even if your own distro's channel is clueless or non-existent.
[19:09:40] <jelly> beuys, there are dozens of distros built on top of Debian, maybe hundreds.  We can only support actual Debian in here.
[19:11:03] <beuys> jelly: I see. If I installed from a Debian version downloaded from debian.org and then made all the changes manually that Ubuntu does during the installation, would you still support it here?

[21:22:21] <Dev0n> sussudio gotcha, thanks I assumed the use of dhcpcd is the same
[21:22:49] <sney> one of raspbian's most prominent customizations is the use of dhcpcd out of the box, where debian would have dhclient
[21:22:56] <sney> their config is likely customized as well

[22:56:27] <kee> Treating them as anything but an opaque magic box causes issues.
[22:56:43] <HelloShitty> I'll do the zero thing with dd
[22:56:43] <kee> Khepra: There's no guarantee that running badblocks will do anything, if the SD card has software to spoof badblocks output.
[22:56:44] <sussudio> Khepra: i had one that died after 1 write.
[22:56:51] <Khepra> WELL THEN! :)
[22:56:57] <sussudio> it came with a spy camera
[22:57:01] <Khepra> <jackie chan.jpg>
[22:57:15] <kee> Zeroing is even more likely to be spoofed; in fact, I wouldn't even call that “spoofing”.
[22:57:30] <Khepra> so, like, you, like, kinda don't wanna use the garbage, like, if it wants to fail after one or two zeroings :)
[22:57:55] <Khepra> kee: "spoof badblocks"?
[22:58:08] <Khepra> badblocks has destructive mode where it writes and reads back, specific bit patterns.
[22:58:44] <HelloShitty>  How do we add that progress bar to dd? Can we see the percentage done?
[22:58:50] <kee> Khepra: Unless it does that sufficiently unpredictably, the SD card can just keep track of the badblocks state and return the appropriate output.
[22:58:53] <Khepra> doesn't matter much if what's read back comes from controller's cache and NOT The actual storage cells. the idea here is to force patterns on it and dislodge.... blood clots.... forcign bad sectors to show themselves
[22:58:59] <HelloShitty> it was something like status=progress ??
[22:59:17] <Khepra> yea, something like that
[22:59:19] <kee> HelloShitty: I just fire SIGUSR1 at it repeatedly.

[22:59:39] <Khepra> kee: oh that's freebsd's crap-dd that has no progress bar
[23:00:04] <Khepra> how can anyone use that. no progress bar? literally unusable operating system.
[23:01:04] <kee> How can anyone use Linux? No graphical screenreader? Literally unusable operating system. Windows is much better; it has a functional, free-software screenreader that works with basically all the software you can think of.
[23:01:38] <Khepra> linux is not an operating system. did you mean gnu/linux? :)
[23:01:48] <kee> I meant systemd/Linux, actually.
[23:01:53] <Khepra> or that, okay.
[23:02:27] <kee> GNU probably has some perfectly good screen reader tucked away somewhere, and nobody's ever heard of it because you need emacs to make it run.
[23:02:59] <Khepra> windows _is_ better. I stopped recommending people run gnu/linux systems for years now. if you don't have the know-how to fix gpu drivers, descend to cli a and get some bash elbow grease..... it's gonna be terribad experience running lee nuks.
[23:04:15] <kee> I stopped recommending people run Windows for years now. If you don't have the know-how to ad-block the start menu, change the microsoft-edge:// handler and get some PowerShell elbow grease, it's gonna be terribad experience running Win Doze.
[23:04:22] <Khepra> because you see, I got fed up with all the "ooh, ahh, you recommended lee nuks, I can't this or that, it crashed, bawwwww touchapd no worky, bluetooth no worky, no games, bawww"  yeah, no. here, have a window.
[23:04:39] <HelloShitty> the zero'ing must be on the device, right? Not on the partition, yes?
[23:04:45] <Khepra> HelloShitty: yes
[23:05:21] <HelloShitty> sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=8192 status=progress
[23:05:30] <Khepra> kee: your argument is poor and misleading. edge? nobody uses that on windows. start menu ad blocks? nobody cares about those. :)

[23:06:18] <Khepra> yeah, that's it
[23:06:23] <kee> Khepra: Every link in the Windows UI uses microsoft-edge://, meaning it opens in Edge unless you override that. Microsoft has gutted half the OS (or it feels like it) trying to stop people from changing that protocol handler.
[23:06:55] <Khepra> HelloShitty: it has no way of knowing block device size. if you really want progress, use pv instead of dd, you can tell it device size and it'll show exact %% with some nice ascii bars too
[23:07:03] <kee> And the flashy ads in the start menu are very distracting for some people who want to actually get work done. Plus, they slow everything down.

[23:09:21] <Khepra> kee: [citation required]
[23:09:22] <kee> Oh, not if you use it like that, obviously.
[23:09:30] <kee> When you use it with dd, it does.
[23:10:05] <Khepra> maybe if you outpout to some super fast nvmes where the tiniest latency of the stdout buffer is going to affect those terragazillion bits per second

[23:12:44] <kee> Whereas it's easy to kill `sudo dd`, because you totally have permission to do that.
[23:12:51] <kee> And Ctrl+C was never invented.
[23:13:51] <Khepra> I have never seen pv misbehave on ctrl-c and I've been using it for years.  is this one of those freebsd shenanigans too? :)
[23:14:00] <kee> Also, every time you log in as root, a kitten falls out of a tree and only lands on three feet.
