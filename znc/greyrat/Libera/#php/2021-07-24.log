[06:52:45] <toretto> When I do `require_once("../database_connection.php")` on every PHP file on my project. So, will there be separate database socket connection from PHP to the database everytime when a requst arrives? Since once PHP processes the page, it kills the execution and since I've included it every page for every request, for every user, will there be a separate connection to the database in this way?
[06:52:53] <toretto> Is that what's happening? Or?
[06:54:44] *** Joins: tw2113 (~tw2113@2001-48F8-6-1318-D2AB-D5FF-FE77-2BD5-dynamic.midco.net)

[07:04:42] <Blondie101010> that actually depends on the database driver
[07:04:53] <Rockwood> o/
[07:05:05] <toretto> It's mysql driver.
[07:05:18] <Blondie101010> again, it depends on the driver
[07:05:32] <Blondie101010> and settings related to persistence
[07:05:45] <toretto> do you know the place where i can find this?
[07:06:39] <Blondie101010> what version of PHP, and what library do you use?
[07:07:11] <toretto> PHP version, v7.4.3 and i use PDO
[07:08:11] <Blondie101010> are you using mysqlnd?
[07:08:18] <Blondie101010> probably, especially if you don't know
[07:08:24] <Rockwood> one more suggestion upgrade PHP version too
[07:08:56] <toretto> Blondie101010: idk, but you can assume that.
[07:10:25] <Blondie101010> https://www.php.net/manual/en/pdo.connections.php
[07:10:36] <Blondie101010> search "persistent"
[07:11:51] <toretto> i see, so it'd be cached. i guess PDO::ATTR_PRESISTENT is default.
[07:12:18] <toretto> i guess, the underlying file descriptor is not closed.
[07:12:48] <Blondie101010> why do you say it's the default?  I think it's not
[07:14:14] <Blondie101010> `var_dump(PDO::getAttribute(PDO::ATTR_PERSISTENT))` to check
[07:14:23] <toretto> idk, but it'd be good to have it as default, since i don't see a reason not though. but yeah, i'll set that attribute.
[07:14:35] <toretto> i see.
[07:14:48] <Blondie101010> note that is not a static call
[07:14:57] <toretto> yeah
[07:15:11] <Blondie101010> toretto:  it's a choice
[07:16:11] <Blondie101010> one or the other may not be as reliable as the other depending on the situation

[18:52:13] <StayHungry> Afternoon, comrades :)
[18:52:29] <StayHungry> I'd like to share a little research with you
[18:53:12] <StayHungry> Where syntax of scripting languages is compared related to a simple task of swapping 24-07-2021 to 2021-07-24
[18:53:16] <StayHungry> https://dpaste.org/dyqS/slim
[18:53:58] <StayHungry> Current participants are AWK, Lua, Javascript, Perl, PHP, PowerShell, Python, R, TCL
[18:54:35] <stenno> again
[18:58:43] <entuland> eheheh
[18:59:12] <StayHungry> entuland was the hero to provided PHP snippet for that list, by the way
[18:59:19] <StayHungry> *is
[18:59:21] <entuland> oh god
[18:59:39] <StayHungry> it's quite readable, by the way
[19:03:13] <Blondie101010> unless you're going to pre-kintergarden this is not a serious research or presentation
[19:04:11] <entuland> yeah, I thought we tackled that in #programming or somewhere else, really a narrow comparison on a super trivial case
[19:09:38] <Byteflux> didn't you also say these were supposed to be the shortest way to accomplish this task?
[19:10:23] <StayHungry> entuland: most popular script languages are covered, case is taken from daily routine. it allowed me to compare startup speed (why ruby was dismissed), peculiarities of chaining commands, last but not least - friendliness of communities
[19:11:08] <stenno> giving you what you want, instaed of what you need, does not measure 'friendliness'
[19:11:50] <stenno> or rather it shows that the person who gave you the line does not care about how or why you use it, otherwise they would have not given you the line in the first place
[19:11:53] <entuland> where are C, C++, MATLAB and possibly others depending on the popularity list you pick?
[19:12:07] <StayHungry> stenno: nitpicking again and again does not contribute to anything here, but thanks :)
[19:12:17] <stenno> this is something _you_ have to learn and understand
[19:12:31] <Byteflux> contributes just as much as this "research" to be fair
[19:12:36] <stenno> your benchmark experiment does not make sense
[19:12:50] <StayHungry> entuland: C is not a scripting language, you know that :D
[19:13:00] <entuland> oh, scripting languages, I missed that bit
[19:13:04] <stenno> if there is someone telling you otherwise, they are dishonest, and actually _less_ helpful
[19:13:09] <Blondie101010> StayHungry:  so far your research is not welcome here
[19:13:27] <Blondie101010> if you have a real question, ask it, but otherwise take that junk elsewhere
[19:13:30] <StayHungry> Blondie101010: are you entitled to speak from community?
[19:13:31] <stenno> giving help can also mean telling someone that their idea is not helpful
[19:13:41] <stenno> their idea is not useful or w/e
[19:14:06] <stenno> which is what i did in #node.js already, which you disregarded
[19:14:14] <Blondie101010> like I said from the start, this is kid level research
[19:14:27] <stenno> so from my point of view, i was the most helpful one
[19:14:30] <Blondie101010> go back to kintergarden and learn things properly
[19:14:35] <stenno> by telling you that your thing doesn't make sense
[19:15:07] <stenno> you are not interested in actually solving a problem in a particular programming language, you are only interested in someone else writing your code for you
[19:15:14] <stenno> and that is the last thing i will say to this
[19:15:43] <Blondie101010> that's probably not the worst problem with their lack of logic, structure, or scientific method use
[19:16:24] <StayHungry> should screenshot that and attach to an article later
[19:16:24] <stenno> yes
[19:16:37] <StayHungry> on people devaluing things they don't understand
[19:17:01] <stenno> also they vaguely are looking for both the quickest and the shortest way of solving it, which doesn't make sense
[19:17:19] <StayHungry> stenno: i do not expect anything FROM YOU, could you just shut up?
[19:17:27] <stenno> you will make a fool out of yourself when publishing it
[19:17:40] <stenno> i am giving you proper advice here
[19:18:04] <stenno> if you don't want to listen because you don't like the reply, you should work on yourself instead of blaming others for your own incompetence
[19:18:05] <da_wunder> StayHungry: just giving that kind of feedback will make you look quite worse...
[19:18:23] <StayHungry> da_wunder: giving advices in a pushy manner looks worser
[19:18:55] <stenno> i gave you advice and help: i said your idea is nonsense
[19:19:23] <stenno> unlike other people in other channels, i was actually helpful
[19:19:23] <da_wunder> StayHungry: imho that was not "pushy" at all...
[19:20:00] <StayHungry> da_wunder: repeating some point again and again without user's consent is not pushy?
[19:20:26] <Byteflux> yes yes im sure the article will be some glorious conclusion of a social experiment on community friendliness measured by willingness to help with a useless "research" project.
[19:20:38] <StayHungry> Byteflux: your point taken, what else?
[19:20:44] <da_wunder> StayHungry: imho not
[19:20:52] <Blondie101010> StayHungry:  please stop NOW!
[19:21:06] <StayHungry> da_wunder: then go outside and try that in some groceries store, in a minute there will be a fight
[19:21:30] <Blondie101010> this is not a social channel and your trolling is irritating quite a few people
[19:21:48] <da_wunder> StayHungry: not really...
[19:21:49] <Blondie101010> the answers you got were pretty fair and polite

[19:23:11] <celphi> morning peeps

[19:25:58] <Blondie101010> I'm sorry for you and your family

[19:27:45] *** Quits: Jck_true (~jcktrue@188.228.89.240) (Quit: The Lounge - https://thelounge.chat)
[19:28:10] <Blondie101010> your research is not on topic, and as repeated by many it is badly constructed and useless
[19:28:21] <StayHungry> it's YOUR point.
[19:28:29] <StayHungry> world is more complex than that.
[19:28:33] *** Joins: Jck_true (~jcktrue@188.228.89.240)
[19:28:34] <Byteflux> no, it's actually not on topic.
[19:28:36] <Blondie101010> you can go ask around elsewhere
[19:29:00] <StayHungry> Blondie101010: list is compiled exactly because i did
[19:29:05] <Blondie101010> !+g7
[19:29:06] <php-bot> Guideline #7) If it's not PHP, we probably aren't the best place to assist you. Try: #sql, #mysql, #postgresql; #httpd, #nginx; #linuxhelp / #linpeople / distro channels (e.g. #ubuntu); #html/#css/##javascript, #web. It *is* OK (within reason) to ask if anyone here would be willing to join another channel to discuss a non-PHP question you need help with.
[19:29:36] <StayHungry> Byteflux: you missed the question and act like it was not asked
[19:29:54] <Blondie101010> he could not have missed it, he was here
[19:32:25] <StayHungry> Byteflux: there are 3 ways to solve the task: a) split/reverse/join, b) regex capture groups, 3) date parsing. so far php section covers only 1 way. and it does so because of the shortness of that oneliner. however, if other options would be shorter, feel free to share.
[19:33:58] <Byteflux> If I share will you stop discussing your research in here?
[19:34:38] <StayHungry> Byteflux: i'm not discussing, the noise is created by a minority who devalues that
[19:37:37] <stenno> the noise was created by you not accepting advice
[19:38:10] <Blondie101010> that exercise doesn't help anyone evaluate a language or learn programming
[19:38:13] <StayHungry> you have right to give one, i have right not take one
[19:38:47] <StayHungry> what words will convince you that your attention directed towards devaluing is inappropriate? there are other people. who can't understand the essence while you're nagging. or are you just enjoying the sound of your speech?
[19:39:26] <da_wunder> so are you saying that giving same advice is wrong?
[19:39:39] <StayHungry> not wrong, but being intrusive is wrong
[19:39:55] <da_wunder> haven't seen anyone here been intrusive...
[19:39:55] <stenno> unlike you, there are a lot of people in this channel who actually know about programming. what makes you think that the advice of those people is worth nothing
[19:40:32] <StayHungry> da_wunder: repeating again and again. like buzzing mosquito.
[19:40:48] <da_wunder> StayHungry: so... 18:09 < da_wunder> so are you saying that giving same advice is wrong?
[19:40:53] <stenno> do you acknowledge then that your project is nonsense?
[19:41:03] <stenno> if you acknowledge it, why are you still here
[19:41:10] <StayHungry> stenno: i'm not interested in talking to you, don't you understand that?
[19:41:11] <stenno> why are you still pursuing that project
[19:41:23] <stenno> because i don't say what you want to hear?
[19:41:23] <Blondie101010> this is trolling
[19:41:51] <StayHungry> Byteflux: so, any code to share?
[19:41:52] <Blondie101010> the only other option is that he really thinks he's intelligent with this childish "research"
[19:42:21] <entuland> StayHungry, please stop it: https://3v4l.org/oV2g6
[19:42:24] <Byteflux> StayHungry: I know of a shorter method but why should I contribute to this exercise?
[19:42:29] <Byteflux> What would I gain from it?
[19:43:15] <Byteflux> It's not promoting anything useful.
[19:43:39] <StayHungry> Byteflux: you offered yourself, and now you're haggling. well, thanks.
[19:43:56] <Blondie101010> he is right
[19:44:01] <Blondie101010> stop please
[19:44:23] <Blondie101010> if you want to learn programming and PHP, then we're here to help
[19:44:30] <Blondie101010> that is NOT the case here

[19:44:47] <Byteflux> I'm happy to help people solve problems and learn but I'm not here to be the subject of your research.
[19:45:12] <Byteflux> Or even participate in your research, rather.
[19:45:13] <da_wunder> and same here - I don't want to be subject of that research
[19:45:31] <Blondie101010> the last solution is probably the best you got so far, but not according to your lack of standards or knowledge
[19:46:14] <entuland> yeah, the last one with the explicit date format parsing is the way to go, now you have all the three approaches you wanted for PHP, let's call it done
[19:46:20] *** Joins: ramblebamble (~ramblebam@37.120.209.204)
[19:46:31] <Byteflux> entuland was close but there's a shorter date-based approach, not that I care to share :P
[19:46:32] <StayHungry> entuland: helpful as always, thank you, sir
[19:47:24] <entuland> agreed Byteflux, the target there isn't really doing a proper parsing of the date, it's at best the showcase of a trivial string juggling in a bunch of scripting languages
[19:49:06] * Blondie101010 would bet that StayHungry participates in code golf challenges
[19:49:17] <entuland> sigh
[19:50:20] <stenno> no, they dont
[19:50:31] <stenno> i am not even sure if they know how to program
[19:51:11] <Blondie101010> true, but the two don't contradict each other
[19:51:28] <Blondie101010> he's not even writing the code himself
[19:51:52] <Byteflux> entuland: I dunno, the whole using this research to measure "startup time" and "community friendliness" muddies the whole thing and makes it rather distasteful.
[19:51:58] <stenno> if you want to compete in codegolfing challenges you must have intricate knowledge about the language
[19:52:27] <celphi> StayHungry: .
[19:52:42] <StayHungry> celphi: you see other options?
[19:52:43] <Blondie101010> lets not make this ugly discussion worse
[19:52:51] <celphi> `preg_replace("/(\d{2})-(\d{2})-(\d{4})/", "\\3-\\2-\\1", $date);`
[19:53:01] <entuland> that's why I said "at best" - we linked these two in ##programming and they've been completely ignored: https://hyperpolyglot.org/scripting https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code
[19:53:03] <celphi> i win
[19:53:25] <StayHungry> celphi: well, entuland already offered preg_replace("/(\d+)-(\d+)-(\d+)/", "$3-$2-$1","23-07-2021");
[19:53:29] <Blondie101010> celphi:  according to which criteria?
[19:53:29] <entuland> celphi, it's not a competition
[19:53:40] <celphi> i know it was a joke peeps relax
[19:53:44] <entuland> ok
[19:54:10] <celphi> lol - im always in here asking for new stuff - it was fun problem
[19:54:22] <celphi> hi Blondie101010 o/
[19:54:37] <Blondie101010> hi
[19:55:01] <StayHungry> entuland: indeed, date variant can be shortened further, but yours is clear
[19:55:11] <stenno> is it really a 'fun problem' though
[19:55:30] <celphi> i wasnt aware you could use $1
[19:55:38] <celphi> thnx for showing me that
[19:55:41] <Blondie101010> no, it doesn't demonstrate anything intelligent that a real programmer would consider
[19:55:51] <entuland> shorter != better, the version I proposed is likely to fail on some ambiguous formats, didn't bother even checking
[19:55:53] <celphi> i agree - still fun to me
[19:56:08] <entuland> s/ambiguous formats/ambiguous inputs
[19:56:10] <stenno> shorter is mostly terribly more worse
[19:56:25] <stenno> there is a difference between terse and 'as short as possible'
[19:56:43] <stenno> if you want as short as possible, then its code golfing, and will result in horrible code
[19:56:48] <Byteflux> probably most codegolfs end up looking like brainfuck lol
[19:57:01] <celphi> it's art imo
[19:57:01] <Byteflux> probably why*
[19:57:29] <entuland> yeah, the target for me is normally as concise as understandability / readability allows
[19:57:53] <StayHungry> entuland: yep, that's why date parsing variants are last on the list as they require multi-locale tests
[19:57:59] <celphi> have to see it more as art than for its practicality.
[19:58:16] <entuland> if that means converting a one liner in a multiline function with helper variables, so be it
[19:58:55] <stenno> [,...$]=[]+/toString/;(_=([é,...$])=>$+$&&é+_($))($) // is my solution for a certain golf problem
[19:59:09] <stenno> (javascript)
[19:59:33] <celphi> [,...] is valid syntax?
[20:00:05] <stenno> n=>eval('for(r=[k=1];k<n;k++)r[k]=r[k-1]*(n-k)/k;r') // another one
[20:00:10] <stenno> celphi: in javascript, yes
[20:00:15] <celphi> dont you mean [_,...]
[20:00:17] <stenno> no
[20:00:35] <Blondie101010> back to #php please
[20:00:37] <stenno> you can execute that line in your browser terminal
[20:00:39] <stenno> sure
[20:00:41] <celphi> sorry
[20:00:49] <celphi> my bad stenno
[20:02:40] <Byteflux> will PHP ever get native unicode strings or did that idea forever die with PHP 6?
[20:02:42] <celphi> stenno can i pm you
[20:03:04] <stenno> regarding what?
[20:03:12] <celphi> that js code
[20:03:17] <Blondie101010> Byteflux:  they can not replace existing strings, but could be added without a real problem
[20:03:36] <stenno> celphi: sure, and you can also join ##jsgolf or ask in #javascript publicly :P
[20:03:37] <Byteflux> i dunno, they could just do what python did, make a major breaking change in a future version
[20:04:35] <Blondie101010> keep in mind there a *many* millions of sites still running on PHP 5 that people hope will eventually get upgraded
[20:04:50] <Blondie101010> making breaking changes to the language doesn't help that situation!
[20:06:35] <Byteflux> yes, but it's okay to break backwards compatibility for the greater good as long as you do it with ample notice and only in major version changes
[20:06:50] <Byteflux> but i'd be okay with a new string type as well
[20:06:58] <Byteflux> ustring maybe
[20:07:25] <celphi> do people still use `spl_autoload`
[20:08:45] <Blondie101010> that's not a valid question
[20:08:56] <Blondie101010> it's not deprecated so you can use it if you need it
[20:09:30] <celphi> i guess what i mean is it a dated method even though it still exists
[20:09:50] <Blondie101010> no difference
[20:09:50] <stenno> what you wanted to ask is 'is there a better alternative to this function'
[20:10:19] <celphi> ^
[20:10:27] <Byteflux> The answer to that is Composer
[20:10:46] <celphi> k and if the includes are your own?
[20:11:00] <Blondie101010> learn to do them with composer?
[20:11:15] <Blondie101010> PSR-4 is a great solution
[20:11:21] <celphi> aight

[20:24:36] <StayHungry> so it's the shortest one for date parsing i guess
[20:25:58] <Blondie101010> that implies that you don't know the implications of date parsing
[20:26:40] <Blondie101010> a good programmer is one who thinks of all cases to make sure their code works in all of them, not someone who write the shortest one liner
[20:27:01] <StayHungry> no doubt
[20:28:28] <StayHungry> da_wunder: thanks for participating, nice to see object-oriented style for a change
[20:29:04] <entuland> what matters there is the explicit format provided for the parsing of the input
[20:29:15] <StayHungry> indeed
[20:29:32] <Blondie101010> do you understand why?
[20:29:41] <entuland> all the others (including my version with date_create()) should _not_ be used
[20:30:15] <StayHungry> entuland: i go iteratively here, one bite a time, validation will come eventually
[20:30:22] <Blondie101010> test your variations with different locales on the 2nd of January
[20:30:44] <Blondie101010> that is the wrong approach
[20:30:53] <Blondie101010> as I said, a good programmer covers all cases
[20:32:23] <Blondie101010> there are situations where a messy one liner does the job, but never if it involves any form of user input
[20:32:41] <StayHungry> what makes you think somebody is about to be one just if they dare to ask a question related to a scripting language? 'There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.'

[20:37:41] <da_wunder> StayHungry: but just for fun - yet again another solution could be just - `var_dump(strftime('%Y-%m-%d', strtotime('23-07-2021')));` - just pointing you how trivial that is - and you could easily find those all possible ways to make that by yourself - just by learning the language
[20:38:58] <StayHungry> da_wunder: don't you like date('Y-m-d', strtotime('24-07-2021' )); from above?
[20:39:41] <Blondie101010> it's as bad as most other solutions we've seen since this *bad* converstation started
[20:39:42] <da_wunder> there is nothing about "liking" something - task is so trivial and you can solve that with n different ways - that is the point
[20:40:02] <StayHungry> da_wunder: yeah, +1 for diversity
[20:40:28] <Byteflux> No but don't you see? This is obviously a good way to measure a runtime's startup performance.
[20:41:53] <Blondie101010> as if you have or even should do anything to measure startup time
[20:42:06] <Blondie101010> s/have/have to/
[20:42:50] <Blondie101010> and again the process time will depend on how good the code is, and in this kind of case the best should be slower than the worst
[20:42:51] <StayHungry> da_wunder: why do you prefer var_dump to echo?
[20:42:57] <Byteflux> Indeed. The startup time is a pointless comparison, especially when you're comparing PHP against Python or such.
[20:43:28] <Blondie101010> var_dump() is a troubleshooting function, so it will output the information in a more reliable way
[20:43:44] <StayHungry> Blondie101010: is your nickname da_wunder?
[20:43:56] <Blondie101010> stop trolling moron

[20:44:20] <Blondie101010> StayHungry: maybe we really need to make you aware of how STUPID you are
[20:44:23] <StayHungry> da_wunder: i did, interested in your approach
[20:44:48] <da_wunder> StayHungry: and yet again another way to make that - `var_dump(substr('23-07-2021', -4) . '-' . substr('23-07-2021', 3, 2) . '-' . substr('23-07-2021', 0, 2));`

[20:45:23] <Blondie101010> lol
[20:45:28] <Blondie101010> what a retard!
[20:45:30] <da_wunder> and yet again just pointing you that there is _multiple_ ways to do that - some of those aren't so pretty but those also do the trick that you want
[20:45:50] <StayHungry> Blondie101010: coward
[20:46:00] <StayHungry> da_wunder: thanks for sharing
[20:46:04] <da_wunder> and really if _you_ learn the language these ways should be quite obivious for you
[20:46:17] <Blondie101010> so stop encouraging this mess
[20:46:20] <Blondie101010> please

[21:57:52] <celphi> __adrian: i looked at psr 7 and i dont see how that relates to controllers
[22:01:34] <Blondie101010> don't you use HTTP?
[22:06:04] <celphi> im going to try this video.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTESlsYTUns
[22:06:08] <Byteflux> celphi: PSR-7 is an API specification for HTTP messages. It specifies a common set of interfaces for interacting with HTTP messages in your code. There are many PHP libraries that provide HTTP message APIs (Request/Response/etc) that are compliant with the PSR-7 standard. There are also many Routers that support PSR-7.
[22:06:42] <Byteflux> Is there any reason you are building all of this instead of just using something like Slim or Silex for your API?
[22:06:54] <celphi> bc i want to understand it.
[22:07:05] <celphi> i dont want to just paste in code on a website and not understand it
[22:07:17] <Byteflux> That's fair, but I would recommend that if you want to understand it, you should learn to use Slim or similar packages and then dissect them instead.
[22:07:40] <Byteflux> Then go on to create your own for learning. But you should use good examples instead of bad ones.
[22:07:49] <celphi> i dont learn from going backwards from a complex problem
[22:07:57] <celphi> it has to be simple -> to more complex
[22:08:16] <da_wunder> or symfony skeleton - and with that I mean not that website-skeleton - just pure symfony/skeleton and add the necessary stuff to that when needed
[22:08:16] <celphi> is that video i just linked bad form?
[22:08:46] <Byteflux> The problem is, you're trying to create something you've never seen/used.
[22:09:04] <Byteflux> So learning and using something like Slim gives you the opportunity to see how a good, finished product works.
[22:09:09] <Blondie101010> celphi:  understanding the process and doing things properly do not imply or require to do everything from scratch
[22:09:12] <celphi> right- so is the video i linked good?
[22:09:49] <Byteflux> Like, you're trying to create a routing/controller system but you don't know how to do it because you've never used one before.
[22:10:17] <celphi> i made a router from scratch but adrian was saying it's not flexible enough
[22:10:22] <celphi> that i should use controllers
[22:11:00] <celphi> so im trying to learn what controllers are - is the video i linked a good example?
[22:11:13] <Byteflux> I saw that router and that's part of why I'm suggesting you learn from existing examples, because that was... not really a router.
[22:11:42] <celphi> it routed my urls not sure how it's not
[22:13:01] <Byteflux> That was a router in the same way that I could make a file called router.php with 10 lines of code doing the same thing and call it a router. It's not a good example of one.
[22:14:02] <celphi> ok im not debating if it was "good" i stated i made one and now im trying to make one better- so my question is - if i use this video is it a good example of controller/router
[22:14:43] <Byteflux> If you were trying to create something completely new and uninvented, I wouldn't be making this suggestion. But you're trying to recreate tools that have been created, studied and recreated to death over the past 15 years, from scratch, *without any reference*
[22:15:15] <Byteflux> All I'm saying is, you should try some of the tools that have already been created so you know what you're making.
[22:15:19] <celphi> im not trying to create something "new" or even the "best" im trying to make something that helps me understand the basic concept of it
[22:16:04] <Byteflux> Yes, a good way to understand the basic concept of it is to actually *use one that's been created*
[22:16:23] <celphi> there's too many abstractions for me to understand it
[22:17:09] <celphi> i dont learn new things that way
[22:17:38] <celphi> just like a math problem., i learn by the smaller operations first
[22:18:02] <Byteflux> From what I've been seeing, I'm skeptical that you're really learning anything at all with this approach. It's your time to waste, but I don't have to indulge. Good luck.

[22:47:01] <celphi> does it matte which one goes first? `declare(strict_types=1);` or `namespace`?
[22:47:25] <stenno> i would always do strict types first
[22:48:08] <stenno> jsut realized that this will affect `include`d files
[22:48:17] <stenno> because of how `include` works in php
[22:48:24] <stenno> less than optimal imo
[22:48:42] <celphi> k
[22:48:56] <celphi> ty
[22:49:56] <stenno> actually not sure if thats a bad thing or not
[22:51:35] <stenno> i guess having a declare statement in an included file is worse
[23:00:08] <celphi> does that apply to required files too?

[23:02:27] <stenno> yes
[23:06:20] <celphi> so are you saying if my index.php file has declare(strict_types=1) that any files that it is using `include/require` those files should not have `include/require` ?
[23:06:52] <celphi> i worded that wrong.
[23:07:42] <celphi> so are you saying if my index.php file has declare(strict_types=1) and any files which are`include/require`d  should not have `declare(strict_types=1)`?
[23:08:57] <stenno> no
[23:09:29] <stenno> what i want to say is just that if you declare strict_types=1 at the beginning of your file, any included/required file will have that declaration applied too
[23:10:02] <stenno> and if you, for whatever reason, have strict_types=0 in one of the included files, it will 'reset' the declaration of the main file
[23:10:25] <stenno> because there is actually no magic at all with php's `include`/`require` statement
[23:10:36] <stenno> it basically just insert the file as-is
[23:11:22] <stenno> similarly, if you rely on strict_types=0 in your main file for whatever reason, and one of the included files has strict_types=1, it will override the declaration
[23:11:40] <stenno> so maybe... you should do the declaration _after_ you included/required the file?
[23:12:03] <stenno> not sure what the best practise is here
[23:12:26] <stenno> also not sure if you can scope declarations, i doubt it though
[23:12:42] <stenno> could un-declare at the end of the file i guess
[23:12:47] <stenno> but i am kinda reaching here lol
[23:13:44] <Blondie101010> your explanation seems to answer the question pretty well
[23:13:55] <celphi> k ty. very imformative

[23:17:13] <stenno> aah
[23:17:29] <stenno> money quote:
[23:17:31] <stenno>  If a file without strict typing enabled makes a call to a function that was defined in a file with strict typing, the caller's preference (coercive typing) will be respected, and the value will be coerced.
[23:18:45] <stenno> this is confusing ngl
[23:18:54] <stenno> gotta think about this a bit
[23:19:32] <celphi> ok i think i get it.
[23:20:15] <da_wunder> and if you're going to use strict types - just add that to every php file after `<?php` tag and that's all
[23:20:22] <celphi> it's saying declared/defined functions are not affected. only when you actually use the function inside a file that has strict_types=1
[23:21:11] <stenno> but this implies that there actually is some magic to `include`
[23:21:17] <da_wunder> and that would be really confusing - you get type error on a.php but not in b.php when using same function...
[23:21:20] <stenno> i will TIAS
[23:22:00] <celphi> yeah ill just add it everywhere
[23:22:10] <celphi> thnx for find and explanation
[23:22:35] <celphi> and guess it would become an issue when using with 3rd party
[23:22:35] <da_wunder> and adding that declare statement to every file doesn't hurt you anyway - it will just make it clearer to each developer
[23:23:18] <celphi> so if i needed to use 3rd party, i would have to create a "man in middle file" that doesnt have it
[23:23:36] <da_wunder> and if some 3rd party library is expecting eg. int and you pass a string - it's _your_ error - you should fix that
