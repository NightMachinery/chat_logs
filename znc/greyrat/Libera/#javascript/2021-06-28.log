[01:09:41] <jellobot> Noustropos, Remember, Java is to JavaScript as Pain is to Painting, or Ham is to Hamster. We don't know Java, and if you're trying to apply your Java knowledge to JavaScript, it probably won't work.

[01:11:18] <Noustropos> My question is, how do I trigger download popup, after receiving HttpResponse in ajax?
[01:12:15] <hmw[at]> Noustropos: You create an <a href> element, append it to the body, trigger the click programmatically, then remove the <a> element again
[01:13:33] <GreenJello> and you set the download attribute to the suggested file name, and look into data urls for a way to generate the href from a string
[01:14:00] <GreenJello> it's a bit of a process to do all of this
[01:14:19] <Noustropos> Yeah, seems like a overkill
[01:14:45] <GreenJello> the alternative is to have the server produce the file
[01:15:00] <GreenJello> it's not overkill when there isn't a better way to do it
[01:15:33] <GreenJello> there's probably a library that does the heavy lifting for you

[01:19:03] <Noustropos> What about submitting a form, and again returning HttpResponse with attachment content-disposition
[01:19:53] <GreenJello> yep, that's the server generating the file option
[01:20:35] <GreenJello> and that's the only way to do it in safari, unless they've implemented download attributes recently
[01:20:36] <Noustropos> Alright, gonna test it
[01:20:52] <Noustropos> Thanks ;-)
[01:25:58] <wroathe> The state of browser diversity is a little sad right now. Firefox is almost completely funded by Google, and they're going to continue doing it so they have somethign to point to when making the argument that they're not a monopoly, and webkit hasn't been relevant in ages.

[03:45:16] <hrobj> I see commonly   if(...null, undefined)    but was surprised by the conditional assignment not working the same

[03:48:16] <hrobj> but looks so verbose,  so I was wondering if any other way...
[03:48:59] <ashnur> no, there is no "right" way, that's an absolutist way to communicate and it's not helpful
[03:49:19] <ashnur> tell us what you are writing, what is the context, and you will get suggestions that are fit for your specific needs
[03:49:47] <hrobj> hm ok, well if it works it works... I suppose I rather like if() ... else()
[03:49:57] <ashnur> but "right" only exists when you talk about religion. otherwise your best case is to follow convention which again, can be multitudinous
[03:50:13] <hrobj> ok will explain, rather simple... I have sometimes an undefined key in an object,
[03:50:22] <ashnur> hmm

[03:51:02] <jellobot> (fail) SyntaxError: Unexpected token ':'
[03:51:15] <hrobj> the key is a data unit from some data...   { let unit = d.unit ? "" : d.unit; }

[03:52:00] <ashnur> that's fine, at the last step
[03:52:27] <ashnur> but in the middle, it only causes headaches because now you have two null values and you don't know if the empty string was your or given to you
[03:52:56] <ashnur> i usually like to only change the data if it's required because it's too big to fit the memory or something

[03:54:55] <hrobj> ashnur, ok I dig it
[03:55:15] <hrobj> ashnur,  in my case Im doing last minute formatting of data in JSX
[03:55:47] <hrobj> I don't mind the feature of JS   making things undefined on assignment somewhere upstream
[03:55:48] <ashnur> so either i copy the whole thing, or wrap it individually something like {source: null, output: ""}. can be bloated, so i don't advise you to do it, it's just an example

[20:49:32] <debron> uhm
[20:49:39] <debron> I tried this yesterday and didnt get it to work
[20:49:56] <debron> i was supposed to see it on chrome inspector but cookie wasnt there
[20:50:00] <debron> but with postman it worked
[20:50:31] <debron> i assumed it was because i was using react with nginx , no server-side scripting, and httponly is meant to be not accessible for the JS
[20:50:41] <debron> but maybe something else was going wrong, ok ill take a look
[20:50:42] <wroathe> debron: You won't be able to set an HttpOnly cookie with Javascript. You'll need to make yoru auth server respond to the auth request with a Set-Cookie header that does it.
[20:50:42] <debron> thanks you
[20:51:09] <debron> i was , i was receiving that header, and still the cookie wasnt being save
[20:51:17] <debron> except in postman...
[20:51:23] <ljharb> debron: only the server should be doing auth
[20:51:37] <ljharb> debron: you can't have security on the web without the serving webserver handling initial auth - iow, no static hosting.
[20:52:30] <debron> i have a server side, API back-end
[20:52:40] <debron> which has access to the database, thats a symfony application
[20:52:45] <onosendi> "No need to ask users for 'cookie consent'" - You have to ask permission to store a session cookie? I thought it was only for cookies that track?
[20:52:48] <debron> and then, i have a different application , front-end, react
[20:53:11] <debron> so, the server is serving the cookie after a succesfull login, but cant make it to work in the react application in browser
[20:53:18] <debron> but it does work testing on postman, weird
[20:53:35] <wroathe> debron: Check the domain and path components in Set-Cookie
[20:53:51] <debron> path / , domain null i believe
[20:53:54] <Alexendoo> onosendi: That's under "claimed" advantages, the rebuttals follow
[20:54:01] <debron> both apps were on same IP, different port

[20:54:07] <debron> no, http

[20:54:56] <wroathe> debron: Well, if the cookie is specified with the Secure attribute then that won't work
[20:54:58] <paule32> so, you can make other decisions like session handling ...
[20:55:07] <ljharb> debron: so that's your problem
[20:55:14] <ljharb> debron: the thing serving react has to be doing auth
[20:55:15] <debron> I see
[20:55:16] <wroathe> debron: Can you share with us the complete Set-Cookie you're seeing?
[20:55:24] <ljharb> debron: you can use nginx to transparently reroute ofc
[20:55:37] <ljharb> debron: but you simply can't have static content serving if you want secure auth
[20:55:55] <ljharb> onosendi: p sure you don't have to ask permission for a session cookie
[20:55:55] <debron> even in the front-end application ?
[20:56:11] <paule32> on server, too
[20:56:19] <debron> i mean, there is no direct access to database, just fetching to a rest api , with requests.
[20:56:35] <paule32> server without secure - i dont know it is secure
[20:56:37] <wroathe> debron: You shouldn't need direct access to the database
[20:56:38] <debron> first need to login, then set the cookie. once the cookie is there, should be sent automatically in each request
[20:56:51] <wroathe> debron: Can you share the Set-Cookie header you're getting back?
[20:56:51] <debron> i know, its not like that
[20:57:02] <onosendi> Alexendoo: ah, gotcha.
[20:57:04] <paule32> what your webserver ?

[20:57:18] <debron> well, anyway, both, nginx
[20:57:25] <ljharb> debron: yes the frontend app has to handle the auth
[20:57:28] <paule32> also apache like ?
[20:57:29] <ljharb> debron: the server portion of it
[20:58:03] <debron> I dont get that point ljharb , could you extend on this?
[20:58:19] <debron> the front end javascript , just ask for auth to the server
[20:58:22] <debron> and receive some token
[20:58:26] <paule32> btw: apache can set secure ssl (https) office time, and directory securities ...
[20:58:36] <debron> then client use that token for every next request in order to not get a 401

[21:00:19] <ljharb> debron: the only server that matters is the one that's providing the main html file
[21:00:26] <ljharb> debron: THAT server has to provide the session cookie
[21:00:30] <paule32> i would not trust unknow user with unknow data
[21:00:43] <debron> provide, or receive and store?
[21:00:45] <ljharb> debron: you can't completely separate "api" from "frontend".
[21:00:59] <ljharb> debron: i mean, all of those
[21:01:02] <debron> because ... i think the part whos providing it would be the symfony application
[21:01:12] <ljharb> debron: "store" might be "put it in the DB", or it might be "give it to another app to store"
[21:01:27] <ljharb> debron: then the server serving the frontend content has to dynamically talk to the symfony app and coordinate auth
[21:01:35] <paule32> a big thing at starting develop, you should think over "split data - html, js, and css" ...
[21:01:35] *** Joins: Hazza (~Haxxa@89nnjg0xckz9ggn6r5xm.ip6.superloop.com)
[21:01:39] <ljharb> debron: you can't do it solely in the browser
[21:01:54] <wroathe> 1. Check the auth response, and verify that the Set-Cookie header is there and correct, 2. Check the cookies tab in developer tools and verify that the cookie was successfuly stored on the client, and 3. Verify that the `credentials` options in Fetch is set to store and transmit cookies
[21:02:00] <debron> so, its better to use traditional php session, give a session ID
[21:02:07] <debron> and set a cookie with that
[21:02:13] <debron> in the client-side browser
[21:02:17] <paule32> cookie make apache
[21:02:20] <paule32> also the server
[21:02:25] <ljharb> debron: yes

[21:24:01] <debron> its only a dump app
[21:24:12] <debron> okay
[21:24:18] <wroathe> debron: Follow the steps above, and it'll work just fine for a SPA
[21:24:18] <debron> dumb*
[21:24:30] <wroathe> 11:31 < wroathe> 1. Check the auth response, and verify that the Set-Cookie header is there and correct, 2. Check the cookies tab in developer tools and verify that the cookie was successfuly stored on the client, and 3. Verify that the `credentials` options in Fetch is set to store and transmit cookies

[21:38:12] <debron> right now i have it stored in react-state XD because i did want to keep on the development, and take this in a further moment
[21:38:53] <Rockwood> HttpOnly means the client script can't access the cookie, as well as you can't read it from document.cookie and pass to axios.
[21:39:04] <debron> i know
[21:39:15] <debron> i though that was the main reason
[21:39:20] <paule32> debron: the first line of your webpages have to set "session();"
[21:39:20] <debron> but aparently not
[21:39:51] <paule32> this makes server side scripting allowed to transfer session id's to other pages in your domain

[22:26:18] <GreenJello> yeah, I always set this up as a proxy when I have separate webpack/api servers
[22:26:41] <debron> thats done in the package.json normally isnt it?
[22:26:56] <debron> i tried that yesterday couldnt make it work... but if u guys say this is a bad idea...
[22:27:05] <debron> i better think on a different approach
[22:27:31] <ljharb> debron: no, not in package.json
[22:27:36] <ljharb> debron: that'd be done usually in like, your nginx server
[22:27:37] <GreenJello> in development you can get away with CORS with credentials, as long as the API doesn't do anything dangerous
[22:27:57] <GreenJello> but in production you really don't want CORS with credentials

[22:28:18] <GreenJello> it's far too easy to get wrong
[22:28:27] <debron> with a proxy that wouldnt be needed then, since both appears like same domain?

[22:31:08] <debron> right?
[22:32:04] <GreenJello> arash, the console doesn't take a deep snapshot of the value. When you interact with it, it recomputes the info based on the current value

[22:33:18] <debron> nvm, i was answering arash , probably wrongly
[22:33:20] <GreenJello> ah
[22:33:28] <ljharb> arash: a few things tho; use const, not var; put JS in .js files, not in <script>; don't use XHR, use fetch
[22:33:43] <arash> I don't understand, it has all the values in httpRequest, i mean it shows them (response code, response... everything) but it can't just show httpRequest.response ?
[22:33:45] <ljharb> arash: (fine to do what you have for learning)
[22:33:54] <ljharb> arash: console.log is async
[22:34:10] <ljharb> arash: whih means that `httpRequest` *eventually* gets all that data. but `httpRequest.response` isn't there at the time you log it
[22:34:45] <arash> ljharb, ok, i should read about async, i don't know what it is

[22:35:21] <debron> i think you could get the value awaiting the request to finish
[22:35:34] <debron> i still need to study more about async programming ...
[22:35:48] <debron> also*
[22:36:26] <farn> arash: When you click on the arrow to expand the output of console.log, you see the value at the time when you clicked, not at the time when `console.log` was called
[22:36:37] <farn> The server hadn't responded yet when console.log was called but it responded before you clicked

[22:49:54] <paule32> but xhr is client side, not server side
[22:50:02] <GreenJello> the other domain has to give you permission to do so

[22:54:16] <farn> It's a security feature. Browsers will refuse to fetch data via JS unless the server specifically allows that. The only way around that is to proxy the requests through a server of your own.

[22:56:41] <arash> so how some websites update data using JS ?
[22:57:31] <farn> arash: The server they fetch that data from allows this by sending CORS headers
[22:57:37] <ljharb> paule32: im not sure what you’re asking
[22:57:54] <paule32> the client browser make a "request", and the server handle this, if you give "arguments" to the link the server software can handle this, and make a "response" to the client

[22:59:04] <ljharb> paule32: so for example, you’d stick it inside another element, yes
[22:59:19] <ljharb> if it contains a script tag (which it shouldnt) then that script might execute
[22:59:26] <paule32> the element is either "head" or "body"
[22:59:57] <ljharb> paule32: both of those already exist before you can make an xhr request
