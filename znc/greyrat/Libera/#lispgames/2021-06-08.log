[00:11:40] <Porta_Potty> Well not to worry!
[00:11:53] <borodust> nah, really, don't bother with that ancient cruft
[00:12:34] <Porta_Potty> The sad thing is the "ancient cruft" (Ltk) is the only solid GUI system for windows at the moment unless you're using a paid Lisp.
[00:13:11] <Porta_Potty> Gtk freezes and the developer flatly told me he didn't have "the resources" to fix it.
[00:13:34] <borodust> that's pretty much how i have it right now xD
[00:14:32] <Porta_Potty> Eventually I'd like to write something I can give to grandma with her lack of knowledge with sbcl, quicklisp, emacs, and Linux.
[00:14:42] <Porta_Potty> If you get my drift. The "shipping for Grandma" model.
[00:14:48] <borodust> i'm working on bridging C++ and lisp world and that pretty much suck all of my available me-lisp-time
[00:14:57] <Porta_Potty> That's important.
[00:15:29] <Porta_Potty> C++ has become "the future" for libraries despite the horrendous mountains of templated code and "auto" typing.

[00:16:52] <borodust> really, give Alloy a chance - i didn't use it but it has less foreign stuff in it - so it should work better across platforms
[00:16:56] <Porta_Potty> Yeah, that worked really well for the game jam.

[00:20:01] <borodust> it's a c++ lib, that's why i used nuklear instead of it at first, but now i have access to c++ world, so.. :)
[00:21:36] <Porta_Potty> It looks pretty good!
[00:22:20] <Porta_Potty> Seems like it's non blocking as far as the main thread goes?
[00:23:32] <borodust> it renders each frame so yeh, it won't block
[00:23:40] <borodust> you basically kinda draw ui each frame
[00:24:01] <borodust> that's where IM GUI comes from - Immediate Mode GUI
[00:24:04] <Porta_Potty> That'll be good when people finally figure out it might be nice to have a REPL ship with a project without the need for Emacs as the calling environment.
[00:24:18] <borodust> just like good'ol immediate mode of opengl :)

[00:58:41] <borodust> need to bump my firefox anyway..
[00:59:02] <borodust> yeeeh, only 1.5Gb of updates, why not
[00:59:31] <borodust> i would say, it looks alive ;p
[01:00:24] <TatriX> No sound this time :)
[01:00:48] <borodust> i see, looks fun anyway
[01:01:22] <TatriX> If I want to make it shipable I would have to render sound to files, cause I doubt there is a sane way to ship supercollider
[01:03:52] <borodust> defaultxr might be able to help with that
[01:04:02] <borodust> or maybe show the right way
[01:05:17] <TatriX> Well maybe it's doable on Window/MacOS
[01:06:33] <TatriX> But on Linux with jack it's a nigtmare
[01:07:27] <borodust> gamekit macos support is kinda funky
[01:08:07] <borodust> it somewhat works for x86-64 but i don't think it works on arm64 machines at all
[01:08:23] <borodust> even with their emulation layer
[01:15:43] <Porta_Potty> Hasn't Apple had a lot of issues over the last few years with their processors and threading or something screwing up SBCL?
[01:16:21] <borodust> it had, yes
[01:17:09] <borodust> support should be better these days though, one of SBCL devs is specifically targeting macos arm64
[01:17:31] <Porta_Potty> We just need a giant oppressive state mandated platform - call it The Peoples OS where we can all be miserable together but hey the software is the same. :P

[01:34:33] <TatriX> Though I guess proper meme wording would be "v sovetskoy rossii komp'yuter vladeyet toboy!"
[01:35:51] <Porta_Potty> It's interesting to see v standing alone. We don't have many (any) single letter consonants in English.
[01:36:08] <Porta_Potty> *single letter consonant words
[01:38:42] <Porta_Potty> I think "a" is our only single letter word. Maybe o if you use it as an abbreviation for of aka will o' wisp
[01:39:18] <Porta_Potty> Oh and that "I" at the front of that sentence. Oops.
[01:40:36] <TatriX> There are plenty in norwegian, and they sound like english(german) without consonants
[01:41:05] <TatriX> they = prepositions
[01:42:03] <Porta_Potty> Are you tri lingual TatriX?
[01:43:27] <TatriX> Getting there
[01:43:48] <Porta_Potty> Cool!
[01:44:23] <TatriX> Our kiddo speaks 3 languages (for free)
[01:44:55] <TatriX> That's quite common in Scandinavia apparently. Average number of languages per person is 2.5
[01:45:31] <defaultxr> hi TatriX :)
[01:45:39] <TatriX> Hi :)
[01:45:43] <defaultxr> i'm not sure about shipping supercollider with anything, i haven't looked into it
[01:46:01] <defaultxr> as far as jack/linux goes, at least the linux audio situation will be better soon, once pipewire is ready
[01:46:12] <defaultxr> since it replaces both pulse and jack while remaining compatible with them
[01:46:31] <defaultxr> i've been using it as my primary audio server for the last couple months and already have very few issues
[01:46:39] <TatriX> Hopefully it get stable enough with low lattency soon
[01:46:58] <TatriX> What is your usual bufsize?
[01:47:01] <defaultxr> true, yeah, there are definitely still a few bugs occasionally
[01:47:05] <defaultxr> hmm
[01:47:08] <defaultxr> you mean with supercollider?
[01:47:12] <TatriX> With jack
[01:47:22] <TatriX> I use 256 samples by default
[01:47:34] <defaultxr> hmm
[01:47:52] <TatriX> Mostly because I use external devices, in particular guitar and electropiano
[01:47:57] <defaultxr> i think i was keeping it around 128 or 64 or something back when i was using jack
[01:48:00] <TatriX> And so I need to have that low latency
[01:48:16] <TatriX> Yeah, 128 is good, but it xruns on my setup
[01:48:24] <TatriX> Very rarely, but xruns
[01:48:29] <TatriX> And that means failed records
[01:48:36] <TatriX> So I had to bump to 256 at some point
[01:48:49] <TatriX> And it works fine, I can't feel to much delay
[01:48:59] <defaultxr> yeah, i would get xruns if i went lower than those i think, but i'm pretty sure it was because of the usb audio interface i used
[01:49:19] <defaultxr> couldn't handle anything lower for some reason
[01:49:59] <defaultxr> i am not sure pipewire has a notion of a buffer size since it is supposed to be able to handle both pro audio and low-power usage use cases simultaneously
[01:50:26] <TatriX> It does. At least in august when I tested it, author added a way to change it for jack
[01:50:30] <defaultxr> my qjackctl says 512 frames/period and 2 periods/buffer in its settings but i don't think that's actually in effect
[01:50:43] <defaultxr> oh okay
[01:50:44] <TatriX> I think you can request desired size
[01:50:51] <TatriX> And it adjusts automatically
[01:51:01] <TatriX> Jack I believe can do the same, i.e. change sample size on the fly
[01:51:02] <defaultxr> yeah i'm still kinda noob about actually changing pipewire settings
[01:51:17] <defaultxr> cuz it mostly "just works" for me
[01:51:26] *** Quits: aeth (~Michael@user/aeth) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[01:51:33] <defaultxr> i thought jack required the server to be restarted if you made those kinds of changes
[01:52:08] <defaultxr> maybe i'm wrong
[01:52:52] <defaultxr> but yeah i've been using pipewire on its own for a few months now and haven't looked back
[01:53:15] <TatriX> man jack_bufsize
[01:53:17] <defaultxr> the only issue i had was that incudine wasn't working with it but i contacted incudine's main dev on github about it and he wrote a patch for pipewire to fix the issue
[01:53:20] <defaultxr> which was very cool
[01:53:24] <defaultxr> and now incudine works on pipewire
[01:53:41] <defaultxr> oh wow
[01:53:47] <defaultxr> yeah never used jack_bufsize
[01:53:53] <defaultxr> weird, maybe it's just a quirk of qjackctl
[01:53:56] <TatriX> I know that because in Ardour you can change it in settings
[01:53:59] <defaultxr> i always used jack via qjackctl
[01:54:25] <TatriX> I switched to cadence + jack2, and since then my life become much easier
[01:54:50] <TatriX> I had a very long debugging session guider by Paul Davis with jack1
[01:55:12] <TatriX> Which ended up in a conclusion that X in jack1 need to be rewritten to make midi work without annoying delays
[01:55:51] <TatriX> Which practically means "use something else" :)
[01:56:00] <defaultxr> haha yeah
[01:56:15] <defaultxr> yeah i think i pretty much always used jack2+qjackctl when i was using jack
[01:56:25] *** Joins: aeth (~Michael@user/aeth)
[01:56:28] <defaultxr> and would run pulseaudio under jack for apps that can't use jack directly
[01:56:51] <defaultxr> fortunately pipewire has been working well enough for most things that i can just run it exclusively
[01:57:00] <defaultxr> very happy with how it's been so far
[01:59:05] <TatriX> Do you have any (live) records with cl-patterns?
[02:00:40] <defaultxr> i have a few recordings of live coding/improvisation sessions i've done, let me see if i can find a good one
[02:00:50] <defaultxr> but nothing i would really consider "finished" per se
[02:01:11] <defaultxr> i haven't actually been making much music lately sadly, just been programming my music software instead haha
[02:01:22] <TatriX> Same, same :)
[02:02:00] <TatriX> That's why one needs a hardware setup, so you can make sounds with the computer switched off
[02:02:13] <defaultxr> https://soundcloud.com/defaultxr/autoclump-edit this was made when i implemented paclump into cl-patterns
[02:02:28] <defaultxr> it's basically just a remix of another track but i like how it sounds
[02:03:43] <defaultxr> and yeah hardware synths are definitely good to have

[05:30:57] <pjb> That's the reason, given that most synthesizers contain a computer, some even are linux boxes (eg. Korg Kronos).  The real reason why you want hardware synth, is to ensure that they work all the time, and will still work in 30 years, contrarily to computers that gets pushed upgrades that breaks everything!  
[05:32:12] <pjb> For example, you cannot use Apple computers to do anything, you cannot store any data on them.  Because Apple can and does, at any time, upgrade the system and block third party applications as deprecated, so you cannot retrieve your data anymore. (or with great pain, if you're a hacker).
[05:33:00] <pjb> But Linux is no different, I've lost as many programs on Linux than on macOS or iOS (the only difference, is that I didn't pay for the programs I lost on Linux).  But in any case, that does not motivate to pay for software!!!
[05:34:08] <pjb> So, hardware synth have their firmware stored in ROM and they'll still work when you retire, and your children will be able to use them when they inherit them.
[05:35:13] <pjb> And there's also an advantage: the hardware nags you to use it, contrarily to some software (even paid for) hidden in some subdirectory.
