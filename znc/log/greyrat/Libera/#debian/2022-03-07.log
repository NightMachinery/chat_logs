[00:00:47] <sney> debian is happy to let you mirror things. read the ftpsync docs, I'm sure there are options for having source packages only or any custom options you want

[03:48:10] <integfred> FWIW The main issue with memory is the linking stage, I'm using ld and gcc rather than clang and llvm and it's had problems ... but that's something else really
[03:49:41] <integfred> Mozilla Firefox 91.5.0esr struggles on this machine, it goes really slow for some reason, hence why I'm trying to compile ungoogled-chromium
[03:50:12] <integfred> There is an ongoing crisis with web browsers atm
[03:50:14] <nickgaw> How much ram and disk space is on that system?

[03:50:56] <integfred> 16GB RAM, I've set swap as 64GB. Disk space is like 1TB or something idk
[03:51:21] <nickgaw> How fast is the processor?
[03:51:48] <integfred> ... 32 bit is where firefox struggles ... on the the 32 bit machine I only have 512MB RAM and a 10 gig swap

[03:55:31] <kee> Binaries you can use on Debian.
[03:55:38] <kee> Technically they're unofficial, I suppose…
[03:56:30] <ddsys> just updated to firefox 91.6
[03:57:30] <integfred> The main [3rd party] supplier of ungoogled-chromium binaries do not provide for 32 bit linux
[03:57:47] <integfred> I may try upgrading firefox, but am not hopeful
[03:58:14] <integfred> I deleted the .mozilla directory and did a apt-get install --reinstall
[03:58:25] <integfred> but still no luck ... running real slow

[04:00:50] <integfred> i may have to do that if ungoogled-chromium does not compile
[04:01:07] <integfred> for now, I'm trying to get around the issue by using 64-bit ninja

[16:38:41] <Cool_Fire> Indeed the kernel update that was released < 1 hour ago I think, fixed it

[18:50:02] <horribleprogram> the amount of layers of diagnosing issues such as freezing windows is like 40 layers deep
[18:50:28] <tga> this is something new, probably triggered by a recent update
[18:50:47] <tga> it makes chromium basically unusable because every hover menu is a potential death trap
[18:50:57] <randall> horribleprogram: I don't see how your comments are helping in any way.
[18:51:10] <horribleprogram> watch how I work
[18:51:12] <horribleprogram> then u'll see
[18:51:13] <jelly> tga, no, pure browser issue, sometimes objects below the cursor seem to move or be rendered differently on mouseover, without actually visibly moving; that results in mouse cycling between "click here it's a link" and default quickly
[18:51:14] <tga> good to know when something is hopeless
[18:51:36] <tga> jelly: but when moving the mouse away it keeps on happening, maybe because it has a long queue of events
[18:51:45] <horribleprogram> I already established that there's a multiple layers to his problem, from the entire stack, now it's time to isolate
[18:51:49] <jelly> that sounds like something different
[18:52:07] <horribleprogram> tga: what's ur issue btw
[18:52:11] <tga> it does make sense because it seems to happen only at the edge of the hovered object

[19:14:49] <tga> this is good, right? means the nvidia card is off?

[21:04:53] <Khepra> ZFS snapshots are much more than just snapshots. You can easily create them, they're almost "free" resource-wise, and can easily zfs-send them around, zfs-receive them from elsewhere, clone them, etc...

[21:09:35] <Khepra> (PSU was going haywire and corrupted stuff willy nilly)
[21:09:42] <tga> so zfs without special features with a 8TB drive and 1GB RAM, would it be much slower than ext4 or what?
[21:09:59] <Khepra> tga: probably, maybe, there's no clean answer
[21:10:15] <Khepra> if hot data fits the ARC and MFU caches, it's going to be faster than ext4 (in reads)
[21:10:31] <Khepra> you can't really compare ZFS and ext4. ZFS does way more thnigs that ext4 can only dream of.
[21:10:44] <tga> you can compare the results in practice
[21:11:03] <tga> drop it on a blank machine, smb share, compare speeds
[21:11:05] <kjetilho> if you only care about speed, of course ext4 will win every time
[21:11:14] <kjetilho> possibly only xfs can beat it
[21:11:27] <tga> I guess the question is just how much slower will zfs be
[21:11:46] <c7s> one day bcachefs will take over the world, but until then zfs is the most convincing COW fs
[21:11:51] <Khepra> tga: you can't compare them like that
[21:11:53] <Khepra> it's like saying your ferrari drives faster than your SUV but your SUV can drive offroad while the ferrari needs very, very, very smooth roads with no potholes, being an inch away from the asphalt. but with the SUV you can go camping, to the store, to a long trip, to a short trip, ...
[21:12:04] <kjetilho> ZFS may be a lot faster for writes, since it can stream the data to disk, while ext4 et al will do seeks to place the data
[21:12:15] <tga> I'm just thinking about my common use cases
[21:12:19] <Khepra> they simply do not do the same things. if you only need "brm! brm! I GO FASSST!" then yeah, no ZFS for you :)
[21:12:21] <kjetilho> but then ... writes are generally not a problem since it can be cached in RAM

[21:15:08] <Khepra> why do you need to resize filesystems?
[21:15:28] <Khepra> in 20+ years of computing I only needed to _expand_ filesystems a few times because I migrated block-level to bigger disks.
[21:15:32] <tga> atm I set up root/home/srv file systems, and sometimes I get it wrong and need to shuffle them around
[21:15:47] <Khepra> I hear people shrink some, but I can't figure out why :)
[21:15:49] <tga> with lvm I get the peace of mind that I can do it easily
[21:16:01] <kjetilho> tga: in ZFS you'd just set quotas for each sub-tree
[21:16:02] <tga> easy, to be able to use the entire drive as /home until I run out of space on /
[21:16:14] <Khepra> you don't even need quotas unless you want to forbid writing to somewhere
[21:16:20] <kjetilho> so you can shrink and grow as needed
[21:16:34] <tga> it's frustrating to have 100GB free on / and 100GB free on /home, and no space to copy a 150GB dump
[21:16:35] <Khepra> ZFS is _pooled_ .       pooled.          give it at least one disk and forget about partitions
[21:16:43] <moldy> for a typical desktop system and even for most servers, i recommend to use as few partitions as possible
[21:17:04] <moldy> my desktops have /boot and /

[21:17:27] <Khepra> still.... no partitions are needed
[21:17:39] <moldy> tga: there's a space reserve for root that can be configured
[21:17:47] <Khepra> ZFS datasets are "filesystems" in certain contexts, like being separate mounts and mount options
[21:17:50] <tga> it's called a 10GB empty file :)
[21:17:51] <moldy> worst case is that you have to boot from a thumb drive and fix stuff

[21:18:39] <kjetilho> just pointing out that the root-reserve is not that useful
[21:18:44] <tga> err how do zvols work then, are they like files or more like partitions?
[21:18:56] <Khepra> they're datasets in form of a block device
[21:18:58] <kjetilho> it's mostly there to compensate for bad fragmentation behaviour in very full filesystems

[21:20:42] <Khepra> suffice to say, tho, that "ZFS dataset" is a very specific construct with several roles. It can act as mountable filesystem, or as a block level volume
[21:20:57] <moldy> tga: `tune2fs -m` iirc
[21:21:18] <tga> Khepra: that's what I was asking, so it's like a block device that you can have a fs on, or pass to a vm to have a fs on

[21:47:25] <randall> Well, "more RAM = better" isn't specific to ZFS. :P
[21:48:12] <Khepra> the only "require" involved is if you want maximum possible performance as (gobs of) ARC offsets some IO overhead but also has MFU and other caches (That linux pagecache doesn't) which makes it much better perfrming in those cases
[21:48:37] <Khepra> randall: true but it has a meaning for ZFS becuse ZFS relies on ARC to offset some things, and ... what I just said above :)
[21:49:39] <sney> I remember reading those high memory needs (plus strong recommendations for ECC, etc) in an enterprise zfs best practices guide in ~2014 when I was implementing it on Illumos. but even then the OI devs were mostly working on Intel NUCs. and that document has since fallen off the internet
[21:49:43] <johnjaye> Khepra: i mean what would you need for an sdcard on a raspi with 32GB of space?
[21:50:56] <Khepra> sney: strong recommendation for ECC given for ZFS has the same reason as if it were given for any filesystem
[21:51:26] <sney> indeed, but for a while it was that same sort of common rumor that it was "required"

[21:58:23] <johnjaye> meaning in terms of ram for zfs for a small disk like 32GB
[21:58:28] <johnjaye> as opposed to 1TB
[21:58:50] <johnjaye> the raspi3 for instance has slightly less than 1GB of ram
[21:59:14] <Khepra> johnjaye: ZFS on sdcard is going to behave poorly because ZFS is iopsy. for that you really do want RAM.

[22:03:47] <johnjaye> i don't know. that's why i asked
[22:04:13] <Khepra> I don't think in 2022 1GB of RAM is reasonable default.
[22:04:30] <johnjaye> i suppose
[22:04:41] <johnjaye> i normally put my VMs at 2GB of ram
[22:04:45] <johnjaye> but probably should use more
[22:04:50] <Khepra> but this never was about reasonable default. question was only whether ZFS _requires_ RAM or not. and I'm saying the "xy GB per TB of disk" is something parroted with no solid ground to stand on

[23:16:16] <frost-core> but when i launch the installer, i see there are no partitons to install on
[23:16:30] <frost-core> i booted iso from grub using "findiso"
[23:17:04] <randall> frost-core: Follow the installation guide on the website to prepare you USB stick, I guess you broke it with unetbootin or other tools.
[23:17:27] <frost-core> i didnt do usb
[23:17:33] <frost-core> i did from hard drive
[23:17:37] <frost-core> i booted from grub
[23:17:46] <randall> How did you get it on the harddrive?
[23:17:46] <frost-core> i am in live now, thats where im chatting

[23:18:14] <kee> You don't need to install onto a partition.

[23:18:25] <frost-core> yes
[23:18:27] <frost-core> the iso
[23:18:30] <kee> No, you shouldn't do that.
[23:18:35] <randall> frost-core: And why did you choose that instead of following the installation guide?
[23:18:44] <frost-core> https://www.linuxbabe.com/desktop-linux/boot-from-iso-files-using-grub2-boot-loader
[23:18:46] <kee> The installer goes on an external drive, then you use that to install onto the hard drive.
[23:19:04] <frost-core> i have a partition that has centos and centos is broken so i did debian
[23:19:16] <kee> You can't install onto the hard drive if you're using the hard drive, because it'll overwrite the place it's installing from.
[23:19:28] <randall> frost-core: The installation guide has dozens of ways to install it that work and are supported, I'd pick those.
