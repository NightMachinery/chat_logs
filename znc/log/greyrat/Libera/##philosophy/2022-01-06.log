[10:39:42] <evolv> from the title, it seems like the focus was on effects by psychedelics, themselves
[10:39:56] <evolv> mentally unhealthy people would be a confounding variable
[10:40:26] <evolv> so "do psychedelics cause detrimental effects to people" would be obscured by the confounder

[11:08:55] <Ungwelian> When you have mind-affecting drugs, it's of paramount importance whether one has a healthy or an unhealthy psyche.
[11:09:28] <Ungwelian> It's a leap of logic to say that if the healthy ones don't get bad effects, the unhealthy ones won't probably have either.
[11:11:17] <Ungwelian> "The research, published in The Journal of Psychopharmacology, is an essential first step in demonstrating the safety and feasibility of psilocybin
[11:11:18] <Ungwelian> -- a psychedelic drug isolated from the Psilocybe mushroom -- for use within controlled settings alongside talking therapy as a potential treatment

[11:21:51] <dispersed> how does 10 or 25 mg compare to "2g of shrooms" I wonder
[11:22:13] <dispersed> if there are no short-term adverse effects then the dose simply was very lo
[11:22:15] <dispersed> w
[11:22:36] <dispersed> and/or there are other psychoactive substances in shrooms
[11:23:57] <dispersed> and/or every side-effect was interpreted somehow as neutral to good
[11:36:45] <Ungwelian> I think the best way would be to actually understand the mechanism of what the psychedelics do.
[11:37:11] <Ungwelian> Not just chemically, but cognitively and conceptually.
[11:37:39] <Ungwelian> And from there, consider the effect on a case-by-case basis.
[11:41:01] <brigand> "Ungwelian: There are good trips and there are bad trips." sounds like you use it 'for fun'
[11:43:02] <brigand> forget what i said
[11:44:30] <tomathy> i have never tripped and considered it good
[11:44:38] <tomathy> in the conventional sense of the word
[11:47:14] <Ungwelian> I know one person who, previously being happy and vibrant, became withdrawn and fearful from psychedelics.
[11:47:41] <Ungwelian> However, the setting in that was terrible, in a prolonged fashion.
[11:48:03] <Ungwelian> Manipulative and abusive relationship, where she was pressured.
[11:49:33] <evolv> dispersed, 25 mg is about equivalent to 3.5 grams of shrooms (roughly depending on species and quality)
[11:49:50] <Ungwelian> They can also definitely cause over-inflated sense of self-worth.
[11:50:11] <evolv> I had done a lot of reading when I used to do them
[11:50:25] <evolv> analogs, anyway
[11:51:25] <evolv> there are other psychedelic molecules in shrooms
[11:51:37] <evolv> one of those is a popular analog sold as a research drug I used to take
[11:51:44] <evolv> it's in very low quantities in shrooms: 4-aco-dmt
[11:52:56] <evolv> they're all substituted tryptamines that bind to various serotonin receptors. The psychedelic effects comes from 5-HT2A
[11:55:35] <evolv> btw, dispersed, 3.5 grams of shrooms is the standard dose
[11:55:46] <evolv> 25 mg corresponds to 3.5 g
[12:00:28] <dispersed> right
[12:00:44] <dispersed> well, it could be those other psychoactives account for some of the adverse effects
[12:03:26] <evolv> if used for treatment, they're not going to give shrooms
[12:03:38] <evolv> they're going to give 10 or 25 mg of psilocybin
[12:04:59] <evolv> and, no
[12:05:22] <evolv> the emotional effects are very much apart of the psychedelic outcomes
[12:06:25] <evolv> if you like at an fMRI scan of the brain, nearly the whole thing lights up
[12:06:29] <dispersed> the RCT setting is a bit iffy, .. imagine being in the same space with 5 other trippers, and being told "either you got psilocybin or placebo"... how likely is it that you wouln't figure it out correctly
[12:06:41] <dispersed> so they should test the confidence as well, how likely they think they had the real thing
[12:06:52] <evolv> neurological communication that do not occur occurs
[12:07:19] <evolv> regions aren't active because information no longer makes sense if they do, hence part of the psychedelic experience
[12:07:38] <dispersed> and if it shows 100% confidence that it wasn't placebo, then it isn't really 'randomized' in the sense, that these people could be biased (many of them might have favorable opinios towards psychedelics, especially since they might have used them before)
[12:07:51] <evolv> adequate placebo was discussed in older literature I've read
[12:07:57] <dispersed> so they could report adverse events as "just fun, part of the trip"
[12:08:00] <evolv> in that, at that time, there were none
[12:08:09] <dispersed> right
[12:08:22] <evolv> I vaguely recall them finding something that is somewhat effective
[12:10:02] <evolv> I imagine this study was double blind also in the sense that the researchers didn't know who tripped

[12:11:10] <dispersed> it's not really that "double" blind if the trippers knew, after all

[12:11:18] <evolv> did you check?
[12:11:19] <dispersed> it's like, if someone cuts your hand out with an axe, you know

[12:11:44] <dispersed> yeah, could dig deeper but it's rather essential anyway
[12:11:48] <evolv> don't underestimate the placebo effect
[12:12:06] <evolv> there will be people who believe they are tripping
[12:12:33] <dispersed> all I'm saying an RCT is not enough for all settings, ... RCT is just held as a gold standard because the other standards are even less valid
[12:12:49] <dispersed> sure, some
[12:13:35] <evolv> this study it doesn't matter
[12:14:08] <evolv> placebo or not, no effect is no effect
[12:14:43] <evolv> if that's because of "biased favorable opinions towards psychedelics"
[12:14:55] <evolv> then that is suggestive that negative effects can be overcome by a positive attitude towards them

[12:17:43] <dispersed> because it's an adverse effect no matter how you twist it
[12:17:59] <evolv> no, the mind affects physiological parameters
[12:18:08] <dispersed> to me, it is a ridiculous claim that psilocbin wouldn't have any adverse effects, and I have used shrooms myself
[12:18:19] <evolv> anxiety and stomach pain is a classic example
[12:18:22] <evolv> anxiety and cortisol
[12:18:30] <evolv> anxiety and neck pain, etc.
[12:19:24] <evolv> they're saying that in a controlled setting, the subjects did not have detrimental effects
[12:19:50] <dispersed> and I'm saying it doesn't seem an RCT would do in this case
[12:20:00] *** Joins: cosmicjoker (~cosmicjok@user/cosmic)
[12:20:08] <dispersed> could be they did something extra to overcome the obvious flaws in the study setting
[12:20:10] <evolv> the setting is the environment in which they were taken and studied at
[12:20:22] <dispersed> okay, bye
[12:20:39] <evolv> that was sudden
[12:21:26] <evolv> I'm not sure why dispersed bent out of shape about this study
[12:21:46] <dispersed> I have no interested in regurgitating this discussion
[12:21:49] <dispersed> *interest
[12:22:07] <dispersed> trying to convince me when I already made my point and you made 0 counter-arguments is troublesome
[12:22:07] <evolv> I'm probably the only one in here who is qualified to discuss this kind of research

[12:23:52] <evolv> anyway
[12:25:00] <brigand> we'll wait for phase ii
[12:25:02] <evolv> the components here involve more than a barebones RCT, mental adverse effects rely on the environment as well, which your anecdotal experience probably wasn't in a setting specifically designed to prevent bad trips
[12:25:08] <arryana> i know quite a few people who work in bio, where are you published
[12:25:09] <arryana> ?
[12:25:34] <evolv> my last and final publication was in JBC
[12:26:39] <arryana> isn't that a vanity publisher in india?
[12:26:43] <evolv> then I dropped out of my PhD program angry over fraud my lab previously published my work stemmed from and gave up the pursuit
[12:26:52] <evolv> no, it's the Journal of Biological Chemistry

[12:27:57] <evolv> hi, amigojapan!
[12:28:13] <arryana> how many citations?
[12:28:30] <Lumine> Good morning everyone
[12:28:37] <evolv> arryana, I dunno, I don't keep up. I published that one a decade ago
[12:28:39] <arryana> heya lumi, what's the good word
[12:28:44] <Lumine> Low sleep
[12:28:48] <arryana> aw
[12:28:51] <amigojapan> evolv: it snowed here today. It has not snowed much in recent years
[12:29:03] <evolv> amigojapan, nice! It snowed yesterday
[12:29:13] <evolv> this area usually doesn't get this much snow
[12:29:24] <evolv> which is kind of routine when I had lived in the midwest
[12:29:28] <evolv> they cancelled schools and everything
[12:29:30] <evolv> lol
[12:29:30] <amigojapan> Nice evolv
[12:30:55] <amigojapan> evolv: public transportation in Tokyo grinds to a halt here when it snows. In Hokkaido it keeps on going
[12:31:29] <evolv> I never leave the apartment
[12:36:27] <amigojapan> evolv: you are hikikomori
[12:37:21] <evolv> who is that
[12:37:48] <amigojapan> People who shut themselves in a house and don't come out
[12:38:09] <amigojapan> It's a big phenomenon in Japan
[12:39:13] <brigand> hikikomori enjoy being shut in
[12:41:06] <amigojapan> That is not really part of the definition but there may be some that enjoy it
[12:41:09] <evolv> yeah, I don't care much about going out
[12:41:21] <evolv> right now I'm temp telework indefinitely
[12:41:38] <evolv> which is great because I really don't feel like communiting to work
[12:41:45] <brigand> else they could just be called "shut-ins"
[12:41:45] <evolv> commuting
[12:42:18] <evolv> but I dislike having to work in my bedroom
[12:42:22] <amigojapan> brigand: it's just Japanese for shut in
[12:42:25] <evolv> my wife has the office room
[12:43:11] <brigand> amigojapan: i'm sure there are differences
[12:43:37] <brigand> nice, evolv. commuting is unhealthy anyway. what's "temp telework"?
[12:44:03] <amigojapan> Like anime is just short for animation

[12:44:52] <evolv> famicom is a portmanteau of family computer
[12:45:04] <brigand> and temp means temporary?
[12:45:22] <evolv> yes, I'm not supposed to have full time telework available to me until about 2-3 years
[12:45:34] <amigojapan> Temp is an English shortening
[12:45:34] <brigand> oh, i see
