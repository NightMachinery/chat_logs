[19:18:59] <inwit> Hi! I'm into convincing notmuch to prefer the html part of certain messages (with a certain Reply-To header, in the ideal case). I've seen an old patch that, afaiu, does something in this line: https://notmuchmail.org/pipermail/notmuch/2016/021704.html However, I don't get to know how to use it. Has anyone been here?
[19:22:15] <inwit> Just in case I wasn't clear: I'd like to prefer text/plain normally, except for some messages.
[19:25:32] <bremner> inwit: see https://nmbug.notmuchmail.org/nmweb/show/1459699478-21167-1-git-send-email-dme%40dme.org for an example
[19:26:50] <inwit> bremner: That was exactly the piece I was missing! :) Thanks!!
[19:31:42] <inwit> It works beautifully!
[19:51:28] <bremner> great! it would be nice if that feature was more discoverable
[19:51:47] <bremner> I guess the wiki would be a start
[19:53:29] <inwit> I can try to document it.
[19:54:12] <bremner> appreciated
[19:55:05] <inwit> Would that be a faq or a tips&tricks item?
[19:58:03] <inwit> And where are those files? I can't seem to find them in the git master.
[19:59:40] <bremner> it's a separate repo.
[19:59:58] <bremner> git://notmuchmail.org/git/notmuch-wiki
[19:59:59] <inwit> I've just found the instructions
[20:00:03] <bremner> ok
[20:00:05] <inwit> Sorry about that.
[20:00:09] <bremner> no worries.

[20:24:32] <inwit> Done! Please, bremner, do check if everything is ok.
[20:27:13] <bremner> where did you put it?
[20:28:20] <inwit>  I pushed to origin/master in the repo of the wiki.

[20:31:37] <bremner> can you give me a link?
[20:34:33] *** Joins: spoofer (~spoofer@64.185.111.205)
[20:44:39] <inwit> Hm. I'm afraid not. I followed the instructions in this page: https://notmuchmail.org/wikiwriteaccess/ I pushed, so that commit should be somewhere in the repo, shouldn't it?
[20:45:04] <bremner> OK. I can look.
[20:48:35] <inwit> Thanks!
