[15:42:13] <re101-uakari-35>  Sorry, I just timed out :D  Dont know if u wrote anything 
[15:42:28] <digitok> that one doesn't work
[15:42:30] <digitok> it isn't matching ?.
[15:42:59] <re101-uakari-35> Ahh damn, did not see that 
[15:43:32] <re101-uakari-35> All right, imma use this one https://regex101.com/r/v9GidM/3 :D  Is there any simpler way to write it? :D  
[15:43:40] <digitok> yea i'll think about it for a sec
[15:47:01] <digitok> i suppose this might be ok https://regex101.com/r/v9GidM/4
[15:48:19] <digitok> although all of these will allow 1.....2
[15:48:24] <digitok> not sure if that's an issue
[15:48:34] <re101-uakari-35> That looks pretty good :D  Actually, we only have the validation rule with a period first, so while .? shouldn't be allowed ?. is actually ok 
[15:48:44] <digitok> lol
[15:48:57] <re101-uakari-35> Hmm it's pretty important that it's only three periods that's allowed :D  
[15:49:08] <re101-uakari-35> Yeah it's kinda dumb, but that's the rules haha :D  
[15:49:24] <digitok> rules are for fools
[15:49:27] <digitok> hehe
[15:50:02] <re101-uakari-35> I think that one is good for now :D  
[15:50:31] <re101-uakari-35> Can you explain nr 4 a bit? :D

[15:53:44] <digitok> lol
[15:54:13] <re101-uakari-35> not a whole lot, I got some other stuff I'm working on as well :D  
[15:57:11] <digitok> well /4 checks that the previous char is not a digit or a ., or a letter that is followed by a single . and a space
[15:57:37] <digitok> and then it checks that the following char is not a digit, ., quote, or end of line

[16:16:04] <digitok> 07re101-uakari-35, you're not gonna like it, but https://regex101.com/r/v9GidM/6
[16:17:21] <digitok> let me know if you can break it

[16:22:24] <re101-uakari-35> It looks really cool, but I can't understand it, and if I have to change anything I wouldn't have a clue on how to do it :D  
[16:23:03] <re101-uakari-35> I think /4 is going to do pretty well, the only thing that would be better if it's possible to make it do the same with a simpler regex :D  
[16:23:14] <digitok> lol
[16:23:15] <re101-uakari-35> Other than that, I'm really happy with the result :D  
[16:23:31] <digitok> hi, i have super complex requirements, one of which is that i require a simple solution
[16:23:33] <digitok> :D
[16:24:28] <re101-uakari-35> Haha yeah I know, it sounds ignorant :D  I'm not very good with regex, so I don't really know what's possible :D  
[16:25:26] <digitok> almost anything if the regex is complicated enough :p
[16:26:28] <re101-uakari-35> Yeah okay :D  Well, the main thing is that it's a period check, and then there's exceptions to the period, maybe I should've let with that :D  
[16:26:52] <re101-uakari-35> But yeah, /4 solves the issue pretty well, and I would know what to do, if there's to be made more exceptions etc :D  So thanks so much for the help man, really appreciate it! 
[16:28:21] <digitok> you're welcome, gimme one sec though
[16:30:07] <digitok> does this help at all https://regex101.com/r/v9GidM/7
[16:30:38] <digitok> basically what it does is match the things that we want to allow, and then make that match fail
[16:30:46] <digitok> thus preventing it from matching
[16:31:26] <re101-uakari-35> Ahh that's actually pretty cool :D  
[16:32:29] <digitok> 07"[^"]*"|“[^”]*”|„[^“]*“ could potentially be simplified to just 07\.+["”“]
[16:32:33] <digitok> if you preferred
[16:33:26] <re101-uakari-35> Yeah that is making it a lot easier to understand :D  
[16:33:32] <digitok> https://regex101.com/r/v9GidM/8
[16:33:32] <re101-uakari-35> What I made at first was actually this 
[16:33:33] <re101-uakari-35> https://regex101.com/r/bbKmRX/1
[16:33:45] <re101-uakari-35> But then I had problems with allowing the three dots inside a sentence :D  
[16:33:52] <digitok> hehe
[16:34:26] <re101-uakari-35> But yeah, I just had an idea that it was going to be simpler to solve it, but thats prolly cus I'm a noob haha :D  
[16:35:18] <digitok> you undercomplicated it :p
[16:35:51] <re101-uakari-35> Yeah :D  But again, thanks so much for the help :D  I have to get going, so I wish you a very nice day! 
[16:36:04] <digitok> you're welcome, and thanks, you too :)
