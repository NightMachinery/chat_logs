[06:05:53] <arch-angel> hm, how do I dual boot windows with linux?
[06:06:03] <arch-angel> arch linux specifically
[06:06:24] <arch-angel> well, I'm confused about the part where I'm supposed to partition my disks to allow windows to install itself
[06:06:33] <arch-angel> and to get the bootloader to work

[06:21:36] <h4rd3n3D> arch-angel:  a standard Win 10 install creates 4 partitions.  If that is your setup atm, use gdisk (or similar) to create /dev/sda5 for /boot and /dev/sda6 for your Arch /.  Do not create a new ESP, just mount your Windows 100 MiB ESP (often found at /dev/sda2) at /mnt/boot/efi before you arch-chroot

[08:29:02] <kuroshi> hi
[08:29:13] <predicament> also, unix can run most linux gnu apps.
[08:29:14] <kuroshi> does anyone know how I can configure shorewall on arch to forward ipv6 connections?
[08:29:15] <arch-angel> arlow
[08:29:22] <predicament> freebsd can.
[08:29:26] <kuroshi> I have dhcpv6 receiving config from one interface, and giving out on another
[08:29:32] <kuroshi> but there is no forwarding between them
[08:29:47] <predicament> that's very vague.

[08:32:07] <arch-angel> did your password expire?
[08:32:09] <Santzes> password is correct for sure, I even tried copy&pasteing it
[08:32:21] <arch-angel> i believe if you do configure it to expire after a set of time
[08:32:26] <MrAureliusR> alright, got systemd-networkd and wpa_supplicant going
[08:32:26] <arch-angel> that might be the problem
[08:32:27] <catman> do you know the root password?
[08:32:29] <MrAureliusR> time for a reboot test :D
[08:32:52] <arch-angel> Santzes, maybe booting into a live arch media and resetting the password for root might work
[08:32:58] <Santzes> Password expires: never
[08:33:10] <arch-angel> i did have such a problem before

[10:01:49] <MrAureliusR> is it an arch package?
[10:01:53] <MrAureliusR> or is it an AUR package?
[10:01:59] <MrAureliusR> because the keys are totally separate
[10:02:24] <john_rambo> I am using the hardened kernel. I also have the regular kernel installed. One thing that I noticed is the fact that the regular kernel receives updates quite regularly. Sometimes multiple times a week but in comparison the hardened kernel receives very few updates. What's the reason ?
[10:03:12] <MrAureliusR> the reason is hardened kernels don't update as often.... because they're hardened
[10:03:23] <MrAureliusR> the whole point is its more stable and less likely to break

[15:28:36] <grawity> though support for some bitmap font formats (bdf, pcf, IIRC?) was outright removed from the font rendering libraries, but that's not an arch thing, and "removed" means there's nothing to re-enable
[15:28:48] <grawity> if you have one of those fonts, convert it to .otb
[15:29:03] <littlepap> i have a bdf font

[19:02:32] <NetSysFire> this may help you, too
[19:02:44] <NetSysFire> its also important to know if it happens on the archiso, just in case

[20:59:36] <LyndsySimon> It would be trivial to write, but I thought I'd ask before I did that and had to manually keep a list up to date.

[23:28:30] <derzahl> so if im using zram, does that mean that I need more disk swap than actual ram for hibernate to reliably work?

[23:32:40] <jonathon> possibly, though if you have disk-based swap then you should be using zswap rather than zram
[23:33:11] <jonathon> (the hibernation process already compresses the image to make it smaller)
