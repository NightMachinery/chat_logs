[06:27:27] <ForeverNoob[m]> ayecee: I like how limited it is. Scripts end up a bit more verbose than Bash for example but for me they're more comprehensible (also perhaps I write it in a way that I might comprehend it later)
[06:27:45] <Elw3> But whatever, i like starting at 1. BUT i must say it causes troubles sometimes.
[06:27:52] <cottnn> i think the reason why lua didn't win over python is 1) 1-based indexing and 2) lack of some *very* basic functionality in standard library
[06:28:01] <Elw3> Because fact is, some loops work better when starting at 0

[06:35:26] <ayecee> Khaytsus: well i mean was C# used in intro cs courses? because that's kinda where we're at here.
[06:35:29] <hodapp> the alternative at the time for a lot of what was done in Java was mostly really shitty faux-OOP C++ with template errors at one end and segfaults at the other, and pretty ghastly C code

[06:37:34] <ayecee> nice
[06:37:40] <tarel2> ¬†Is C ++ the real world?

[06:39:50] <hodapp> cottnn: it's always been "possible"; the question is whether it's idiomatic and how well it will work when you have to deal with libraries
[06:39:54] <cottnn> There are 20 ways to do the same thing, 12 of them are deprecated, 6 have undefined behaviour and 2 that people actually use

[08:51:47] <Phantom> it's a plain web cam

[08:52:07] <Phantom> not lied, maybe we misunderstood each others?

[10:52:36] <pagios> ZFS question, when i want to create a new zfppool am i required to use DISKS ex /dev/sda or can i use partitions too /dev/sda1 for examole ?
[10:53:24] <mlu> pagios: both should work: ZFS works with any block device
[10:54:20] <mlu> that said: it's better to use whole disks if possible
[10:54:26] <pagios> mlu: so i can do sudo zpool create new-pool /dev/sdb /dev/sdc oor sudo zpool create new-pool /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 right?
[10:54:38] <mlu> yes, but the first is preferred
[10:54:58] <pagios> mice: on the HOST machine i am using DISK RAID1 using zfs, on the VM i am thinking of creating only a ZFS with no mirror on the partion of those disks
[10:54:59] <mlu> since the partitions just add extra overhead / complexity in most use cases where using ZFS would be justified at all
[10:55:32] <mlu> your VM shouldn't be running ZFS at all, unless you're using it as a dev/test environment for your ZFS setup
[10:55:34] <pagios> hmm
[10:55:41] <pagios> so ob the vm what would be best?
[10:55:48] <mlu> just use ext4
[10:55:50] <pagios> the host is already running raid1 zfs
[10:56:03] <mlu> does your filesystem need to span multiple physical devices? use ZFS
[10:56:12] <pagios> mice: i thought of ZFS on the VM for the snaphot feature, if i want to replicate between 2 vms on different hosts

[10:57:27] <mlu> or have it setup as a SAN

[10:57:44] <mlu> I guess you could use a VM as a SAN node, but that's just adding extra complexity
[10:57:44] <pagios> we are talking about 10TB here
[10:57:56] <pagios> i prefer two VMS isolated on different hosts
[10:58:03] <pagios> dont want to add a single point of failure

[10:58:55] <mlu> if I were you, I'd setup a very robust ZFS host and then have the VMs access that data via NFS
[10:59:02] <pagios> so the VM would best be 50GB say for root / , swal, /boot /data to store the actual DATA (all ext4)
[10:59:20] <pagios> mlu: i am using proxmox on the hosts , running zfs
[10:59:50] <mlu> right
[10:59:54] <mlu> and /data would be a NFS mount of some sort
[11:00:08] <pagios> mlu: i see, in this case LVM + ext4 on the VM would be best
[11:00:14] <mlu> and you'd probably want to get fancy on the networking part of the VMs

[11:02:11] <pagios> or better to have LVM on all the Filesystems/partitions on the VM ?

[11:02:36] <jim> pagios do you still have lots of unpartitioned space?
[11:02:37] <mlu> but like with zfs: it should either be an lvm device or something with your usual run-of-mill ext4-like filesystsems
[11:03:01] <mlu> whenever I use LVM, I like to have everything under LVM

[14:35:56] <clarity> I don't know about names, sorry.  Most devices have their MAC address printed somewhere.
[14:35:57] <Mystified1234> or obtain the mac address
[14:36:02] <clarity> ip neigh shows the arp table

[19:05:31] <phogg> ano: "op" is what you call a channel operator and "ops" is the plural form. This usage is so typical that it is essential that everyone understand it. Shortening "user" by removing a vowel is not usual and could cause confusion.
[19:05:36] <clarity> Well given that people aren't crashing the vast majority of the time, I'd say it's safe the vast majority of the time.
[19:05:58] <djph> phogg: and yet /usr/ :D
[19:06:00] <justsomeguy> If I don't speed, where I live, I'll be killed by the traffic around me.
[19:06:03] <ayecee> leaving your car unlocked is safe the vast majority of the time too.
[19:06:04] <clarity> Or at least "not much less safe than not speeding"
[19:06:16] <phogg> ano: as indeed it did for me, because /usr/ is a Unix directory which was *originally* a shortened form of "user" (because in the 70s every byte mattered).

[23:05:41] <s33ker> msiism it does nothing for me if i type that
[23:06:05] <Psi-Jack> Hmmm.. Look at the topic in the browser, then. üòõ
[23:06:15] <msiism> Helenah: I don't actually think symbolic links play a role there.
[23:06:27] <Helenah> In think in distros it tends to be one command because of util-linux and things being the thing that's most likely used.
[23:06:31] <babyface> I'm trying to build something and I get "config.sub: missing argument" what does that mean?
[23:06:47] <johnjaye> alpine is busybox userland isn't it? so it might be different to gn u

[23:28:50] <msiism> s33ker: I see.
[23:29:08] <msiism> Well, BusyBox commands on Alpine all have `--help`.

[23:39:25] <tirnanog> in alpine, the man-pages package has deliberately limited coverage of certain sections. presumably, because busybox is used.
[23:39:36] <s33ker> ahhh i already used it but did not see it actually provides the description yes you need to use it as busybox <command> --help
[23:40:16] <s33ker> nice thanks for the help would have missed it probably
[23:40:17] <tirnanog> also, they don't appear to package posix man-pages in any form, which could stand in for man busybox (imperfectly).
[23:40:37] <msiism> You shouldn't need to put `busybox` infront of that, though.
[23:41:12] <msiism> tirnanog: BusyBox does deviate from POSIX in some places, though. I have forgotten where exactly, though.
[23:41:25] *** Joins: yustin (~yustin@user/yustin)
[23:41:52] <tirnanog> yeah. hence, imperfectly. the posix pages would be serviceable in many cases but it would always to be necessary to read the busybox documentation to know the exact particulars.
[23:41:54] <s33ker> true only when you use busybox as a refrence to list all the commands

[23:42:21] <msiism> Right.
[23:42:42] <tirnanog> even so, I'm somewhat surprised to find that's no posix-man-pages package or such. it would be useful anyway.
[23:43:07] <tirnanog> that is, no matter what the system, having the 1p section available locally can be handy.
[23:43:47] <msiism> I haven't really used my Alpine laptop since I've set it up‚Ä¶ Don't really know why.
