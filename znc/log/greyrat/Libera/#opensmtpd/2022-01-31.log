[11:47:47] <aje> Hello
[11:48:16] <aje> I'm having some issues getting OpenSMTPD to speak to iOS Mail and Roundcube
[11:53:22] <aje> https://pastebin.com/DwJJ7CUM
[11:54:42] <zelest> is 10.6.6.3 iOS or Roundcube?
[11:54:55] <zelest> Either way, they seem to be using pipelining, which isn't supported.
[11:55:06] <zelest> pipelining = sending commands in incorrect order
[11:55:50] <aje> https://pastebin.com/2qc7e1rA
[11:55:57] <aje> Here's my smtpd.conf
[11:56:02] <aje> 10.6.6.3 is roundcube
[11:56:43] <zelest> I've never used roundcube (lies, I used it back in 2004 or so) but maybe there's some setting to disable pipelining?
[11:57:18] <aje> I connect iOS mail ... gives slightly different output
[11:57:21] <aje> 9fb7ca9cf44e1daf smtp connected address=119.56.107.108 host=108.107.56.119.unknown.m1.com.sg
[11:57:24] <aje> 9fb7ca9cf44e1daf smtp disconnected reason=disconnect
[11:57:58] <aje> It's like it won't authenticate
[11:59:57] <zelest> double and tripple-checked that you specified the correct username and password?
[12:00:00] <zelest> using tls?
[12:00:41] <betabug> wrong authentication method?
[12:03:06] <aje> Hmm, for some reason TLS wasn't enabled in iOS mail for the outgoing server. So it seems to be working.
[12:03:12] <aje> Email just came through.
[12:03:22] <aje> Issue now is getting Roundcube to work.
