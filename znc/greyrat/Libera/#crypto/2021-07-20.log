[20:41:23] <TimMc> gggpkm: Double-spending is when you send out two transactions (likely to different parties) that both draw on the same money.
[20:41:40] <TimMc> It's one of the central problems of all digital currencies.
[20:41:50] <MacGyver> It's also not specific to blockchain-based currencies.
[20:42:17] <MacGyver> DigiCash (iirc) solved it by voilding all privacy protections if the double-spend coins were brought together.
[20:42:22] <MacGyver> voiding*
[20:42:57] <TimMc> Yes, I like that approach. :-) I wonder how well it would work in practice.
[20:43:15] <MacGyver> Well DigiCash went bankrupt....
[20:43:19] <MacGyver> (No that's unfair)
[20:43:35] <MacGyver> (They went bankrupt because the world wasn't yet ready for digital currencies)
[20:43:45] <TimMc> Presumably not because of double-spending, though. 
[20:43:49] <MacGyver> Yeah.
[20:45:49] <gggpkm> okay , what is the mean of "privacy protection " 
[20:47:49] <MacGyver> Well in this particular instance, it means the payer was anonymous and payments were untraceable once the DigiCash had been issued.
[20:49:32] <snappy> i found out a digicash implementation was tried out in australia with st george (the bank)
[20:49:55] <snappy> https://www.afr.com/politics/ecash-slays-st-georges-internet-dragons-19990804-k8xoe
[20:50:37] <MacGyver> Yeah and apparently there's also GNU Taler which is based on the DigiCash protocols.
[20:50:46] <MacGyver> But it's been over a decade since I studied the DigiCash protocols, that's all you're gonna get from me.
[20:51:03] <snappy> if i remember correctly, digicash supported offline spending
[20:52:20] <MacGyver> Yeah, they used an interesting signature scheme that's also the underpinning of this whole "Double-spend == anonimity revoked" thing.
[20:52:50] <MacGyver> So technically you *could* double-spend.
[20:52:51] <danieldg> hmm, revoking anonymity only matters if you can't create accounts freely
[20:52:59] <MacGyver> But it was entirely clear whom to sue at that point.
[20:53:16] <MacGyver> who to sue*
[20:53:22] <MacGyver> I think?
[20:53:28] <MacGyver> Ah whatever, it's not like anyone cares.
[20:53:30] <danieldg> (else you double-spend by transferring to a sacrificial account and have it double-spend)
[20:53:37] <int-e> so... that's reminiscent of credit cards
[20:53:54] <MacGyver> Well yeah. I personally kinda like my financial system being underpinned by a legal framework.
[20:54:03] <int-e> (especially in the old pre-internet days when offline payments were the norm)
[20:54:36] <danieldg> a legal framework has so many more features than double-spend prevention though :)
[20:54:48] <int-e> oh really
[20:54:55] <danieldg> (and yes, most of the features are good ones imo)
[20:55:13] <int-e> a legal system doesn't prevent crime, it creates crime :P
[20:55:13] <MacGyver> DigiCash has the advantage (and I believe Taler banks on this) that it fits well into the existing social and legal structure.
[20:56:27] <TimMc> It always has to boomerang right back to the bank, though, which is one of the big downsides.
[20:56:53] <MacGyver> Yeah, if it's not used much you get issues like correlation attacks, maybe.

[20:57:18] <MacGyver> But that's no different from offline digital card-transactions, really.
[20:57:30] <TimMc> Yes, it's fine for most purposes.
[20:57:31] <MacGyver> So it's not a drawback added.
[20:57:38] <MacGyver> It's just "not a drawback removed".

[21:32:03] <gggpkm_> why is xor usually used in a hash func
[21:34:38] <ms7821> it's like the main "combine these inputs" operator. what else would you use?
[21:35:09] <riv> xor is magic
[21:35:50] <gggpkm_> mix[i] = mix[i]*0x01000193 ^ data[i]
[21:35:52] <gggpkm_> ie
[21:36:55] <riv> multiplying by a number is basically randomizing it
[21:37:06] <riv> and if you xor something random with something predictable, the result is random
[21:38:01] <gggpkm_>  xor something random , getting more scattered?
[21:38:30] <TimMc> XOR doesn't "scatter" the inputs -- it's bit-by-bit.
[21:39:03] <gggpkm_> so what is the purpose to do ^
[21:39:04] <wasamasa> it's reversible
[21:39:20] <gggpkm_> mix it ,then reverse it 
[21:39:20] <wasamasa> a ^ b = c, c ^ b = a, c ^ a = b
[21:39:41] <gggpkm_> compress data?
[21:39:48] <ms7821> in the case of a hash, you don't care about the reversing
[21:39:52] <riv> i explained the purpose
[21:39:52] <wasamasa> so suppose you are implementing hash codes for an object
[21:39:59] <riv> random xor predictable = random
[21:40:00] <ms7821> it's more that if either side changes you get a corresponding difference in the output
[21:40:04] <wasamasa> you can take the hash codes of each member and combine with xor
[21:41:07] <ms7821> you could use a full add instead, but it's usually harder to reason about
[21:41:29] <TimMc> gggpkm_: Look up information on one-time pads. They're not a good idea to use, but it might give you more intuition on the subject.
[21:42:15] *** Joins: MaxFury (~MaxFury@139.5.251.79)
[21:44:01] <ms7821> probably also worth noting that its output has the same effective parity over inputs on average, whereas an and operator would tend to give you zeroes, and or ones
[21:45:17] <MaxFury> dogecoin will yield you all zeroes
[21:45:30] <MaxFury> definitely and inevitably
[21:45:35] <jds> xor is reversible - it preserves the information, combining it in a linear way. other bit operations such as 'and' smash the bits together in a way that cannot be reversed

[22:36:14] <ericonr> jds: the diagrams in that analysis are so hot
[22:36:28] <jds> right? best crypto article i've seen in years
[22:36:33] <jds> accessible but great detail
[22:40:30] <MaxFury> i think we should rename cryptography to something else 
[22:40:48] <MaxFury> too much confusion
[22:41:43] <ericonr> this channel is too informal for such a decision, you should take your musings to a more relevant channel

[22:53:29] <riv> MaxFury, we should use #cryptography instead of #crypto to escape the bitcoin people
[22:53:35] <riv> but it's too late for tat
[22:54:06] <MaxFury> if you can't escape them, embrace them
[22:54:20] <ericonr> that's a bad way to live your life
[22:54:44] <danieldg> MaxFury: only do that if you can move on to extend/extinguish

[23:04:54] <jds> MaxFury: this is a really good introduction that begins at first principles: https://cryptopals.com/
[23:05:25] <MaxFury> jds, what's the incentive for me to learn it?
[23:05:45] <jds> you asked how a newbie is supposed to learn
[23:05:56] <jds> your incentive is your problem
[23:06:04] <jds> as is the lack of one
[23:06:10] *** Quits: kulak1 (~kulak@user/kulak) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:06:42] <MaxFury> but on delving deeper ( I am a deep thinker ) , i found that incentive is crucial for learning
[23:06:54] <aczid_> an updated cryptopals is at https://cryptohack.org/ and the best free course is at https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto

[23:07:16] <MaxFury> maybe that's why many kids don't study, because they don't  have an incentive
[23:08:08] <MaxFury> they should either be rewarded or punished
[23:08:09] <riv> MaxFury, check dan boneh course on coursera, it is kinda difficult but good
[23:08:14] <MaxFury> both can serve as an incentive
[23:08:23] <MaxFury> riv, i don't like difficult
[23:08:32] <riv> ok
[23:08:34] <MaxFury> thanks for the suggestions though
[23:08:38] <MaxFury> i appreciate them
[23:08:43] <sarnold> it's hard to get gud if you don't do difficult
[23:09:05] <MaxFury> maybe when i am old and don't have anything to do, i'll look those courses up
[23:09:42] <jds> you have enough time to waste talking nonsense here
[23:09:46] <MaxFury> even if i get good, what's the benefit to me?
[23:09:57] <MaxFury> i like talking to fellow human beings
[23:10:09] <MaxFury> it's not a waste of time!
[23:10:26] <danieldg> do you like looking ignorant?  If not, learning is useful.
[23:10:27] <MaxFury> if it's enjoyable, it's productive
[23:10:56] <MaxFury> ignorant to whom? is a random stranger going to ask me cryptographic problems to test my level of ignorance?

[23:11:11] <MaxFury> besides on this channel
[23:11:52] <MaxFury> no one is going to know if i am ignorant in cryptography or not, because no one is going to test my knowledge in it
[23:11:53] <mats1> ...ive met autists like that at meets
[23:12:07] <MaxFury> nice
[23:12:12] <MaxFury> i don't go to meets
[23:12:16] <mats1> probably people who hang out here
[23:13:06] <jds> you keep talking about "benefit". you're just trying to bait us into saying cryptocurrency is potentially a valuable line of research or something. you - obviously - define benefit for yourself. i don't think many of us care about your personal motivations for being here
[23:13:28] <int-e> what's the benefit of feeding a troll?
[23:13:44] <MaxFury> jds, i actually didn't think that far, you overestimate me
[23:14:08] <MaxFury> but that was a good one, i would be proud of myseld if i actually put so much thought into it

[23:17:46] <aczid_> this is the worst passive aggressive approach to learning I've seen in a while, lol
[23:18:54] <aczid_> if you don't care about your own education, why should anyone else?
[23:19:55] <aczid_> I guess jds summed it up pretty well
[23:20:36] <MaxFury> i think adults have little incentive to educate themseleves on such niche topics
[23:21:03] <riv> MaxFury, dude you NEed to learn crypt, PlEAESE learn cruptyo
[23:21:11] <riv> plzzz
