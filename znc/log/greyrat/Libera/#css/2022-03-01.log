[04:35:00] <jargon> nenscript is a form of whitespace code.
[04:35:36] <jargon> As I pointed out, nenscript only functions because "{{" never occurs in any known language.

[04:36:12] <FunkyBob> that's what the validator is seeing

[05:53:14] <jargon> rickame, nenscript is a whitespace syntax.
[05:53:58] <jargon> ILY is commonly mistaken for a literal whitespace virus.
[05:54:24] <jargon> ILY is "vbscript" not whitespace.
[05:55:41] <jargon> such scripts put to use code normally considered as whitespace as functional instructions.
[05:57:30] <jargon> For example, pixels normally 100% transparent in a png yet assigned color value could be a storage location for the payload of a whitespace virus.
[05:58:54] <jargon> “clear GIFs” are another example.
[06:00:56] <jargon> ILY was called a whitespace virus because it used a bogus file extension followed by a lot of spaces and then the extension .vba.
