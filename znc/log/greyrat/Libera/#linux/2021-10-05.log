[00:29:57] <neshpion> does anyone use fetchmail? i'm thinking there has to be a better way to update my statusbar than to poll my inbox every 20 minutes.  what if i get a mail on the 21st minute and i end up waiting 19 minutes to see it appear in my statusbar?  or worse, if i *read* the mail before my statusbar has a chance to tell me there was one, rendering my script moot? :(
[00:30:14] <Dagmar> You can always use procmail
[00:30:29] <Dagmar> It does things _when_ email comes into the system
[00:30:56] <Dagmar> Of course, since it's been around literally for as long as mailx it's only a matter of time before kiddies declare that it's obsolete because of systemd
[00:31:07] <neshpion> hmm but my email comes into a VPS which I must poll
[00:31:15] <Dagmar> Then polling you must do
[00:31:26] <rustytaco> if they move anything email at all related into systemd, i will begin fully boycotting that abomination.

[00:33:46] <Dagmar> You should use ML and NN to predict how often mail comes in and adjust your polling interval dynamically with blockchain so VC money will fall from the sky
[00:34:46] <neshpion> or i should just realize that nobody sends me mail, at all, ever, and just be content with manually checking it with my email client once every couple of weeks to re-confirm my ineffable irrelevance
[00:35:19] <neshpion> (and possibly marking some mails as unread so i can see how things look when i do have mail)

[03:54:14] <chemosabe> so i have old frankecomputer with xp and it was BSOD so i install debian, it has not network card. am stuck in terminal, no gui. so when i try to flash a different OS, f2, f10 or f12 (it was one of these) no longer works, it just boots straight into debian. now i am root but i need to identify what /dev is the usb so i can change grub config(?)and none of the commands ive been googling seem to help

[05:18:37] <ayecee> a really pro thing to do would be to develop a test case that can trigger the fault reliably
[05:19:17] <ayecee> as a fault you can't reliably reproduce, can't be reliably fixed
[05:19:40] <tacokoneko> purpux: the link you just sent is the same link i sent above, essentially i am wondering whether it is possible for powerpc, because basically when i use the argument in there (-Mhex) for x86 binaries, it works, but if i use it for powerpc binaries, the objdumps for powerpc i have been trying all say "warning: ignoring unknown -Mhex option" and print decimal values

[05:20:42] <purpux> tacokoneko: then the option does not exist. You should try piping the output into awk or something similar to try and convert decimal values to hex

[05:33:38] <tacokoneko> ok i might have been overreating a little bit, i just seriously considered converting the values to hexadecimal by parsing the assembly and it does not appear to be nearly as difficult to get 100% correct as I originally assumed. thanks for being a voice of reason, i will try to just use regex, sed, awk etc it should be fine

[07:22:44] <jcbjoe2021> Kel: not working i did grep -e 'jcbjoe2021|termbin' file.txt and i get a lot of text
[07:22:56] <jcbjoe2021> and -E
[07:23:11] <Woodsman> did back up of HOME. I downloaded the linux mint uma ISO and when tried to burn to USB, it didn't take, so tried Etcher,similar in that it wouldnt work, I tried FLASH to get it on the USB and I "think" I got same result as right clicking and trying to burn to disc, it wouldn't take. I don't know where to go from here and researched something about VM, but it's not as easy as instructions I read. something as simple as burning to USB was problematic,
[07:23:12] <Woodsman> please advise
[07:23:24] <Kel> so you're trying to return lines in file.txt that contain either jcbjoe2021 OR termbin, but not necessarily both?

Every time I boot Linux and then boot Windows, windows time clock keep getting changed one hour. I have tested it by booting Windows continuously without booting Linux Mint, and time stay stable. I wonder it is anything to do with Dual booting Linux with GRUB menu?

[16:19:55] <Dagmar> Another explanation is that it's not the cert that's expired, it's the intermediate cert that's signed it that expired and you've been too lazy of a git to actually keep your CA store up to date.

[16:28:07] <sudomann> But when you renew a certificate with lets encrypt, you have to solve a challenege.

[18:01:17] <ruc2625> Takios: it feels exactly like IRC -- in the good old days.
[18:01:24] <hexnewbie> It's an occasionalism.
[18:01:26] <Gustavo6046> Language is an agreement to define communication. English is just a very, very, very old, and very widespread, agreement on words and syntax etc., in particular.
[18:01:48] <Gustavo6046> There are institutions that try to approximate the extent of English, particularly those that maintain dictionaries.
[18:01:51] <Psi-Jack> Japanese and Chinese languages are far far older.

[18:09:15] <genoobie> okay, I used "startx" and then I ran a java program

[18:10:00] <hexnewbie> genoobie: In that terminal?
[18:10:27] <genoobie> after I hit "startx" it went fullscreen, so no "terminal" window to speak of
[18:10:40] <hexnewbie> genoobie: Anything else is entirely dependent on what window manager is running inside the X server. Some do respect the Windows Alt+F4 shortcut (KDE, for example)
[18:10:43] <genoobie> I tried ctrl-c.
[18:11:20] <genoobie> all I can do is switch tabs in the java program.
[18:11:41] <peac> hexnewbie: quiet is not in the bootargs, and startup log is displayed correctly. any other idea ?
[18:11:47] <genoobie> It boots up to CLI and then I typed "startx"
[18:12:03] <genoobie> then java blah blah blah.

[20:46:57] <aruns> My understanding from the AWS documentation is that when you create a new EC2 instance, you specify the private key to be used when establishing the initial SSH connection.
[20:47:34] <akk> msiism: So you've had success complaining to large corporations about their websites? I'm impressed, I used to try that and if I got an answer at all, it was hostile.
[20:48:00] <aruns> So I was told by my boss to SSH into this EC2 instance, but since we don't have the private key, I am guessing we would either need to have the client provision a new sudo user for us (provided they have access)
[20:48:21] <akk> (though I did send a note to the local paper yesterday about their broken RSS feed, and while I didn't get a reply, the feed started working again)
[20:48:27] <aruns> Or reset the server (it isn't attached to a live domain) and add a new SSH user
[20:48:39] <ananke> aruns: no, you specify the public key, which should have been configured already, and your org should have the corresponding private key

[22:16:31] <TheGuestMovie> kubast2: I know about ssh-copy-id, but that involves setting up keys, entering passwords the 1st time, etc. I'm making disposable VMs that only run on localhost and want to do away with all the security stuff that dont apply to me.
