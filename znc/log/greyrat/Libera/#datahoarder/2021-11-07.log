[00:36:33] <evilgohan2> skye0: which one?
[00:36:41] <evilgohan2> Might have been my script
[00:36:44] <evilgohan2> unless it's something else
[00:39:17] <evilgohan2> just checked it and mine is definitely still working (assuming you have the latest commit to the main branch which was on August 29th)
[00:39:25] <skye0> evilgohan2: either yours and/or ThePendulum's, alerting if a Twitch streamer is live. Found it, i didn't sort it in the right folder
[00:39:43] <skye0> copied and pasted it directly from IRC chat and/or some link I don't remember, don't remember the Git repo
[00:40:06] <evilgohan2> ah. Mine doesn't alert so much as it is just a script wherein someone can edit the config and return "Status: Online" or "Status: Offline"
[00:40:13] <evilgohan2> But, of course, that can then be used to alert.

[14:38:18] <Snuupy> single node is fine
[14:38:23] <Snuupy> as long as you have several drives
[14:38:32] <Snuupy> I mean if the node dies just replace the node as long as you're fine with downtime
[14:38:42] <Snuupy> single node ceph is kinda like regular zfs or btrfs
[14:38:48] <Snuupy> or having a synology
[14:38:58] <moo> hm i see. thanks
[14:39:12] <Snuupy> I chose to do it on an rpi because I didn't need high performance or node redundancy
[14:39:13] <Snuupy> just data redundancy
[14:39:53] <Snuupy> but the second you want multi-node you need something with a dedicated (preferably) 10gbit backhaul
[14:40:02] <Snuupy> or even dedicated 1gbit with 2 NICs

[20:53:49] <Snuupy> so it depends on what you're doing
[20:53:56] <Snuupy> also IOPS are low af
[20:54:10] <Snuupy> cus spinny disks, no UASP on the WD enclosures, etc
[20:54:43] <Snuupy> if you can spend a few hundred more you can just shuck the drives into a case and buy cpu/mobo/ram
[20:54:51] <Snuupy> well have to buy case too
[20:55:00] <Snuupy> gets pretty expensive so I just went with an rpi

[21:01:03] <Pea> I wanted to build a new server recently but the case I want, the cpu, the memory, the power supply.. all out of stock haha
[21:01:13] <Pea> So I guess I'll keep what I got another year.
[21:01:33] <Allie> i definitely want to build a thing in this case: https://teenage.engineering/products/computer-1
[21:02:03] <Pea> I'm surprised people like that case. It looks very cheap to me.
[21:02:15] <Pea> It does look unique though.
[21:02:33] <Allie> i absolutely love it
[21:02:39] <Allie> it's a very satisfying aesthetic

[21:11:04] <rmmh> Snuupy: there are usb3 4 drive bay things for like. $60
[21:11:14] <rmmh> idk if it supports uasp 
[21:11:27] <Snuupy> I wasn't willing to shell out another $80
[21:11:37] <Snuupy> if I'm going to do that I might as well just upgrade the entire setup
[21:12:15] <Snuupy> and do everything proper
[21:12:26] <Pea> Do it right the first time, save money long term
[21:12:29] <Snuupy> and have things run over sata instead of usb
