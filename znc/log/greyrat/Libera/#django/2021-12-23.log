[03:29:46] <anoopemacs`> Hi! I may have found a small mistake in the official Polls tutorial.
[03:29:47] <anoopemacs`> I just wanted to confirm with someone that it is indeed a mistake before I raise a pull request to the docs.
[03:29:47] <anoopemacs`>  
[03:29:47] <anoopemacs`> This concerns the part 3 of the tutorial at
[03:29:49] <anoopemacs`> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/intro/tutorial03/
[03:29:53] <anoopemacs`>  
[03:29:56] <anoopemacs`> This quoted part is explaining how the django template lookup works:-
[03:29:58] <anoopemacs`>  
[03:30:01] <anoopemacs`> """
[03:30:04] <anoopemacs`> The template system uses dot-lookup syntax to access variable
[03:30:07] <anoopemacs`> attributes. In the example of {{ question.question_text }}, first
[03:30:11] <anoopemacs`> Django does a dictionary lookup on the object question. Failing
[03:30:14] <anoopemacs`> that, it tries an attribute lookup - which works, in this case.
[03:30:17] <anoopemacs`> If attribute lookup had failed, it would've tried a list-index
[03:30:20] <anoopemacs`> lookup.
[03:30:23] <anoopemacs`> """
[03:30:27] <anoopemacs`>  
[03:30:28] <anoopemacs`> But I found that question.__dict__ was:
[03:30:31] <anoopemacs`> {
[03:30:34] <anoopemacs`> '_state': <django.db.models.base.ModelState at 0x7f12fc7bea60>,
[03:30:37] <anoopemacs`>  'id': 1,
[03:30:41] <anoopemacs`>  'question_text': "What's up?",
[03:30:44] <anoopemacs`>  'pub_date': datetime.datetime(2021, 12, 18, 15, 45, 52, tzinfo=<UTC>)
[03:30:47] <anoopemacs`> }
[03:30:50] <anoopemacs`> This means that the *dictionary lookup on the object question* does NOT fail
[03:30:54] <anoopemacs`>  
[03:30:57] <anoopemacs`> Am I mistaken in my understanding somehow?
[03:30:58] <anoopemacs`> Does it have anything to do with deferred loading of =Question.question_text()=?

[03:52:32] <anoopemacs> Hii!
[04:02:16] <pembo13> anoopemacs, HI
[04:09:49] <anoopemacs> @pembo13, I have a small doubt on the template dot lookup order. Would you please take a look at https://dpaste.org/YAuW
[04:12:41] <pembo13> anoopemacs, why are you expecting `.__dict__` to fail?
[04:15:06] <anoopemacs> I am expecting it to fail because it said so in the official Polls tutorial at https://github.com/django/django/blob/ca04659b4b3f042c1bc7e557c25ed91e3c56c745/docs/intro/tutorial03.txt#L372
[04:17:36] <anoopemacs> The Polls tutorial implies that the lookup order is 1. Instance dict 2. Dynamic attribute lookup 3. List index lookup & so on
[04:18:58] <anoopemacs> The Polls tutorial also explicitly states that the 2. Dynamic attribute lookup succeeds. Thereby, implying that the 1. instance dict lookup failed
[04:20:28] <anoopemacs> Just to be even more explicit, I am expecting `question.__dict__['question_text']` to fail
[04:25:48] <pembo13> anoopemacs, i definitely don't think that would work
[04:26:02] <pembo13> maybe `question.__dict__.question_text` might work
[04:26:20] <pembo13> __dict__ is an attribute, so that would be #1
[04:30:23] <anoopemacs> @pembo13, Thanks a lot for the suggestion. I will ponder over __dict__ itself being an attribute.
[04:31:01] <anoopemacs> @pembo13, BTW, what is the right place to ask these sorts of questions, The Django Forums?

[17:45:57] <GinFuyou> wait, you form args are incorrect it seems
[17:46:42] <GinFuyou> your init has first positional argument as user, and you pass it to super
[17:47:07] <GinFuyou> and in the view you provide only data
[17:47:11] <Guest47> oh that may explain it. I have a hard time with that part of my code all the time
[17:47:47] <GinFuyou> btw if you only want to change widgets it can be done in form's Meta class
[17:48:51] <Guest47> So instead of changing the widgets inside of init it can be done in meta?
[17:49:09] <GinFuyou> I also don't recommend redefining class name... name form so it's not mixed up with built-in onr
[17:49:39] <GinFuyou> Guest47, yes, Meta.widgets I think. I don't remember details but I think it should do the trick
[17:49:40] <Guest47> so put MyPasswordChangeForm and MyPasswordChangeView ?
[17:50:30] <GinFuyou> Yes, it's more clear. Should work anyway, but it's also a safety mechanism from a silly mistake
[17:50:40] <Guest47> Good point
[17:53:05] <Guest47> I am confused by your user/init/super point though
[17:54:04] <Guest47> If I remove user from init and define it after super I get an error. __init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'user'
[17:54:18] <Guest47> Because the password change view needs a user to be logged in

[19:34:05] <GinFuyou> Guest47, no, if you want to write new method in the child you need override something of parent to hook a call for your method. e.g. dispatch(), post(), form_valid(), etc.
[19:34:20] <Guest47> ahh that explains it then...
[19:35:16] <GinFuyou> Guest47, you write code in form_invalid()
[19:35:36] <no_gravity> I'm looking into adding user accounts now!
[19:35:37] <Guest47> I don't see form_invalid() https://github.com/django/django/blob/main/django/contrib/auth/views.py#L337

[19:36:19] <Guest47> oh so all of those views in the link you sent are universal in django it doesn't matter if there is a parent class?
[19:36:30] <no_gravity> Uh oh! It seems there is no built in flow for the standards like signup/login/logout?
[19:36:47] <no_gravity> So you have to build it from the ground up, create views for each task etc?

[19:37:36] <Guest47> there is for signup no_gravity but for signup it is more custom and logouts are very easy
[19:37:58] <Guest47> there is not for signup*
[19:38:36] <no_gravity> Guest47: Hell. So you have to do routes, views and everything for signup, login, logout, change password, delete account \o/

[19:39:11] <apollo13> the only thing you have to do is sign up and account deletion
[19:39:19] <apollo13> and those are so special that there is no good fit for all
[19:39:27] <Guest47> yes appollo13 is right sorry
[19:39:42] <apollo13> also there is https://django-registration.readthedocs.io/ for registration which many people use
[19:39:55] <no_gravity> apollo13: Ok, but that still means it is a very manual process to stitch it all together.
[19:40:30] <apollo13> how adding "    path('accounts/', include('django.contrib.auth.urls'))," is a very manual process is beyond my understanding but ymmv
[19:40:33] <soxfoxrox> I have a model with an @property decorator (age). I'd like to use this decorator as an exclude in a queryset in views.py, but I can't figure out whether my syntax is wrong or if this is just not possible. Model is here: https://dpaste.org/pdSk

[19:41:57] <apollo13> arbritrary functions can't do that
[19:42:20] <apollo13> you can do the thing that you do in the decorator via SQL also, but you cannot use a python decorator for it
[19:42:52] <soxfoxrox> apollo13, thanks.
[19:42:59] <Guest47> maybe i can do the rate limit/captchas then without needing to do stuff from scratch ty
[19:43:08] <no_gravity> apollo13: What is that "include" in the line you posted?

[19:44:23] <apollo13> no_gravity: that is just a line I copied from the docs I linked above, maybe you want to read those?!
[19:44:31] <apollo13> no_gravity: yes you have to import it
[19:45:24] <no_gravity> apollo13: Import what?

[19:48:15] <Guest47> apollo13 yes I need to specifically do it for the form submissions
[19:48:20] <no_gravity> apollo13: But that does not explicitely tell how to do it.
[19:48:53] <Guest47> Password reset for example I don't want someone to manually keep submitting the password reset form even if there is a captcha to keep sending reset emails over and over
[19:48:56] <apollo13> no_gravity: that sentence is part of the normal docs, not the tutorial
[19:49:02] <no_gravity> apollo13: I tried it a bunch of ways. Like: from django.contrib.auth.urls import include
[19:49:07] <no_gravity> apollo13: But that does not work.
[19:49:19] <apollo13> of course not, please don't guess where imports are coming from
[19:49:26] <Guest47> because there will be a problem where then my email address will get flagged and nobody else will be able to get password reset emails

[19:50:40] <apollo13> truth is that it is not easy to implement in a generic way

[19:55:45] <apollo13> no
[19:56:00] <Guest47> then how come most companies i worked for do it then

[19:56:22] <apollo13> I cannot tell you that; but encrypting an email address which is usually used for login is imo bogus

[19:56:49] <Guest47> Yea I agree seems like a waste to do but I am a bit hesitant

[20:01:01] <GinFuyou> I think they failed on it few years ago? Might be wrong
[20:01:16] <Guest47> Probably but they have money to burn
[20:01:55] <Guest47> i think it would go against their bottom line if they didn't have it in plain text so they could make $ off the plain text email
[20:03:30] <Guest47> oh btw another question going back to django
[20:03:51] <Guest47> for the tokens what is best practice? HMAC, random crypto hash, etc?
[20:04:10] <Guest47> for signup idk what i should do for email verification tokens
[20:04:19] <apollo13> so I just looked it up, one clear mention of encryption in GDPR is https://gdpr-info.eu/art-32-gdpr/ namely Art 32(1) and that doesn't read to me as if encryption were a requirement
[20:04:36] <Guest47> ok cool good to know

[20:08:22] <luigibu> question.. so, I have an app in my proyect called Group, but some how.. now im getting strange stuff.. cos user has a relationship with groups too.. so.. when i try: user.group_set() is referencing another table and not my group table..
[20:10:01] <apollo13> you need to set related_name properly
[20:10:18] <luigibu> i put one.. but the set dont work
[20:10:47] <luigibu> users = models.ManyToManyField(User, related_name="user_groups")
[20:10:50] <apollo13> well if you set a related name, it is not group_set but user.<what_you_set_as_related_name)
[20:10:57] <luigibu> this is what i have in group model
[20:11:09] <apollo13> so use user.user_groups
[20:12:23] <luigibu> so to add a new relationship.. should be user.user_group(new_group)
[20:12:25] <luigibu> ?
[20:14:35] <apollo13> eh no, there is .add() I think

[20:18:09] <apollo13> Guest47: regarding tokens, all approaches have ups and downs, for instance if you use a random string you have to store it in the db, if you use a properly constructed HMAC you can do without db storage
[20:19:12] <Guest47> hmm ok so you dould not recommend this approach? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24935271/django-custom-user-email-account-verification
[20:19:33] <Guest47> See the warning comment though
[20:20:07] <Guest47> Then there is this which is by one of our own https://blog.tinbrain.net/blog/django-registration-redux.html
[20:20:31] <Guest47> And something like this for expiration https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64047332/django-expire-token-authentication
[20:20:57] <apollo13> well you can use an approach similar to d.c.auth.tokens
[20:21:06] <apollo13> which is what Curtis does in his redux example
[20:21:14] <Guest47> ok
[20:21:26] <apollo13> that said, django-registration supports customer user models, which begs the question why you wouldn't wanna use it
[20:23:04] <Guest47> idk about django-registration it is another third party you need to rely on. But it seems like it is built by the django core team and will always be maintained?
[20:23:06] <apollo13> django-registration simply uses signing.dumps(obj=user.get_username(), salt=REGISTRATION_SALT) for the activation key, which I guess is probably also okay
[20:23:20] <Guest47> ok
[20:23:28] <apollo13> django registration is not built by the core team, the core team also no longer exists
[20:23:35] <Guest47> oh i see
[20:23:52] <apollo13> that said I'd trust django-registration which is used by plenty of people probably more than myself
[20:24:17] <Guest47> then what is the django board then?
[20:24:39] <apollo13> while it is third party, it is one that is used, relatively straight forward (look at the code) and will still save you a lot of time compared to writing on your self
[20:24:41] <Guest47> i guess the core team has been replaced by an open source community?
[20:24:57] <Guest47> ok cool sounds good
[20:25:21] <apollo13> we were always opensource, anyways the current structure is document here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/organization/
[20:25:46] <Guest47> ah nice ty
[20:26:12] <apollo13> the board (if you mean the technical board) is an elected team that has the possibility to decide when other decision processes fail
[20:26:23] <apollo13> then there is the DSF board which is the board of the foundation
[20:26:36] <apollo13> which has little to no barring over the actual code itself
[20:27:58] <Guest47> cool so it looks like when i told you about rate limiting maybe you could do something in the djngo main code perhaps ;)
[20:28:11] <apollo13> Guest47: why me, you can do that as well
[20:28:19] <Guest47> yea true...
[20:28:21] <apollo13> :þ
[20:28:25] <Guest47> but you make the decision though right?
[20:28:33] <apollo13> I don't
[20:28:51] <apollo13> or at least I don't think it will since it will most likely not get escalated to the technical board
[20:29:01] <Guest47> interesting
[20:29:30] <apollo13> I would expect consensus on adding rate-limiting
[20:29:41] <apollo13> so there is no reason to put a vote to the technical board
[20:29:56] <Guest47> yea so then in the PR for the rate limit there would be a discussion then who ultimately decides?
[20:30:24] <apollo13> well the discussion should happen first on the mailing list
[20:30:33] <Guest47> ah didn't know you had one of those
[20:30:58] <apollo13> there is https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/django-developers -- simply opening a PR would probably get pointed to the ML to gather more feedback
[20:31:30] <apollo13> but taking your example: based on what would you like to limit password resets?
[20:32:01] <Guest47> https://github.com/pennersr/django-allauth/commits/master
[20:32:13] <Guest47> If you control + f 'rate limit' you will see what allauth did
[20:32:50] <apollo13> Oh, but I was asking you on what you'd limit (ie ip etc…)
[20:33:28] <Guest47> form submissions which i suppose would be with IP addresses like allauth does
[20:33:51] <Guest47> This is another approach through cache https://github.com/pennersr/django-allauth/pull/2631
[20:34:09] <apollo13> well all approaches will need a cache to store the state most likely
[20:34:16] <apollo13> you probably wouldn't want to put it into the db :D
[20:34:20] <Guest47> ah right
[20:34:43] <Guest47> Yea my comments in that closed PR were about db which is the best of my abilities lol
[20:34:55] <Guest47> but check out isms's comment
[20:34:57] <apollo13> the thing is blocking by IP will probably not be enough if someone wants to hurt you
[20:35:00] <Guest47> a nice chart showing the problem
[20:35:06] <apollo13> a bot net is cheap
[20:35:41] <apollo13> as I said, I understand the proble, I just don't think that the solution is easy
[20:36:07] <Guest47> why not make a setting in the settings.py file to say what should the limits be?
[20:36:31] <apollo13> something like this would certainly be a requirement
[20:36:37] <Guest47> for sure
[20:37:01] <apollo13> especially with IPv6 for instance you'd probably block whole /64 etc…
[20:37:14] <Guest47> hmm yea and stuff behind cloudflare
[20:37:27] <apollo13> and well it really depends, if you have an API you probably want a global ratelimit per user etc etc…

[22:41:55] <foo> If I want to match a period in a route, I have this:     url(r"^projects/([A-Za-z0-9_-]+)/([a-z0-9_-]+)/results/chart", views.chart), -> which does not match a period. I believe I want this, correct?     url(r"^projects/([A-Za-z0-9_-.]+)/([a-z0-9_-]+)/results/chart", views.chart), ? Or do I need to escape the period?

[22:45:19] <GinFuyou> foo, sounds likely
[22:45:20] <foo> actually, I minds well use a str
[22:45:51] <GinFuyou> also plausible ^_^
[22:45:55] <foo> Whoever built this logic only matches specific stuff in a URL... but there's no validation to ensure that is only accepted on input so of course this breaks.
[22:46:02] <foo> *shakes head*
[22:46:34] <GinFuyou> Not sure what you mean... validation is regex matching
[22:48:16] <foo> GinFuyou: right, but it's only matched in urls which represent usernames
[22:48:27] <foo> ...but there's no validation on usernames
[22:48:42] <foo> so usernames can be whatever, but the URL only matches A-Za-z0-9_
[22:48:58] <foo> GinFuyou: Just doing some holiday cleaning of someone else's code. :)
[22:49:02] <foo> GinFuyou: happy holidays!
[22:49:34] <GinFuyou> Ah I see, I thought you were talking about django in general
[22:49:49] <GinFuyou> Happy holidays you too.
[22:49:55] <foo> Ahh, nah, excuse my vagueness. Half way talking to myself for sanity's sake
[22:49:56] <foo> ;)
[22:50:28] <GinFuyou> np. Surely that sounds like case for username validator on model field
[22:54:02] <foo> If I want to convert this to accept a string, and I have this:  url(r"^projects/([A-Za-z0-9_-]+)/([a-z0-9_-]+)/results/chart", views.chart) ... I think I want this: url(r"^projects/<str:username>/<str:project_slug>/results/chart",views.chart)  where my view has: def chart(request, username, project_slug): -> right?
[22:54:29] * foo confesses he's a bit rusty but if I'm reading the docs accurately, this is it
[22:55:38] <GinFuyou> I think yes, I mostly use CBVs though
[22:55:51] <GinFuyou> also there is a slug converter too
[22:56:17] <foo> GinFuyou: thanks, thought I was on the right track.
[22:56:21] * foo does some tests

[23:05:56] <foo> GinFuyou: is there a way to test a URL? Via CLI or such? Looks like it's not matching as I expect

[23:11:02] <GinFuyou> match url against pattern? Well debug mode already should tell you that.
[23:11:02] <foo> Unless a period isn't match in a string
[23:11:43] <foo> "str - Matches any non-empty string, excluding the path separator, '/'. This is the default if a converter isn’t included in the expression."
[23:11:47] <foo> I assume that should match a period
[23:11:49] <foo> But maybe not
[23:12:15] <GinFuyou> > str - Matches any non-empty string, excluding the path separator, '/'.
[23:12:28] <GinFuyou> oh, already found yourself
[23:12:37] <foo> GinFuyou: to me that says it should match a period, correct?
[23:12:40] <GinFuyou> no, it should. and slug too
[23:12:47] <foo> Ok, then... *scratches head*
[23:13:00] <foo> Unless this is another AWS issue and something is cached *mumbles under breath*
[23:13:06] <GinFuyou> what pattern do you have?
[23:13:38] <foo> url(r"^projects/<str:username>/<str:project_slug>/results", views.results), , trying to match /projects/period.test1/dec-21st-period-fix/results/
[23:13:45] <foo> I think that should match?
[23:14:25] <GinFuyou> it should be path() if you use converters =)
[23:14:47] <foo> GinFuyou: oh! Darn it, the docs do say that. Thanks for eyeballing that, my oversight
[23:15:12] <GinFuyou> url() is old anyway, it's now path or re_path if you want regex directly
[23:16:50] <foo> GinFuyou: ah, good to know, thanks. This is a project that we touch like once a year, heh.
[23:16:55] <foo> ... aka. it needs some love
[23:17:46] <pembo13> Coincidentally, I'm just reminded that `from django.conf.urls import url` doesn't even work in Django 4.0
[23:18:43] <foo> pembo13: huh, good to know. I'll put in a word with "the folks" to see if we can look into migrating.
[23:18:47] <foo> and preparing for that.
[23:19:48] <GinFuyou> it should be safe to just replace url with re_path
[23:20:59] <foo> Ok, this still ain't matching: path(r"^projects/<str:username>/<str:project_slug>/results", views.results), , trying to match /projects/period.test1/dec-21st-period-fix/results/
[23:21:04] * foo eyeballs the docs again
[23:21:27] <foo> oh, I don't need r"" to change that
[23:21:36] * foo is getting humbled right before the holidays
[23:21:37] <GinFuyou> and you don't want '^'
[23:22:09] <foo> GinFuyou: yup, thanks
[23:23:45] <LordKalma> I though we used `re_path` in modern django
[23:24:11] * foo re_path's LordKalma 
[23:24:24] <LordKalma> only 1 match :p I'm unique :p
[23:24:27] <LordKalma> bad joke
[23:24:39] <LordKalma> speaking of django. Why do we use trailing /?

[23:25:21] <pembo13> LordKalma, who is "we"?
[23:25:41] <LordKalma> the django recomendations
[23:25:54] <LordKalma> for example, it's 127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ by default :p
[23:26:08] <pembo13> LordKalma,I'm not sure how much of a recommendation it is, vs. a default
[23:26:26] <pembo13> LordKalma, I at least don't use trailing slashes in my projects
[23:26:33] <foo> Ok, third times a charm. path("projects/<str:username>/<str:project_slug>/results", views.results), still isn't matching WARNING - Not Found: /projects/period.test1/dec-21st-period-fix/results/ -> am I missing something?
[23:26:50] <foo> I have a mixture of path()'s and url()'s in this list, I don't think that should matter
[23:27:13] <foo> I also can't imagine it needs to be path("/projects/..."
[23:27:14] <pembo13> foo, it doesn't
[23:27:25] <pembo13> except url should be changed to re_path
[23:27:41] <GinFuyou> maybe mentioned trailing slash?
[23:27:50] <foo> From the view: def results(request, username, project_slug) -> args match
[23:28:01] <foo> GinFuyou: OH.
[23:28:12] <foo> I wonder if path handles that differently than re. Hmm, worth a shot. /me tries
[23:29:16] <pembo13> foo, as I understand it, path is just a simpler version of re_path
[23:29:32] <pembo13> i think re paths were maybe confusing people coming from other frameworks
[23:29:48] <pembo13> so path was created (purely my unresearched theory)
[23:31:19] <foo> GinFuyou: thanks, that trailing slash did the trick.
