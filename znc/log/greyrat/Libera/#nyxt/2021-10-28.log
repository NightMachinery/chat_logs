[21:48:16] <sirmacik> have you upgraded to newer stable again?
[21:48:25] <sirmacik> or still rocking old one after a revert?
[22:45:43] <hendursaga> Can someone advise how to remove such atrocious code duplication as https://github.com/hendursaga/nx-freestance-handler/blob/main/invidious-handler.lisp#L40, https://github.com/hendursaga/nx-freestance-handler/blob/main/nitter-handler.lisp#L23, https://github.com/hendursaga/nx-freestance-handler/blob/main/teddit-handler.lisp#L23, etc?
[22:46:04] <hendursaga> Perhaps some sort of macro??
[22:47:18] <hendursaga> I wish I knew how to do more object-oriented code in CL :(

[23:01:14] <mariari> ahh I have some code around this, I don't use OO
[23:02:36] <hendursaga> mariari: so, just macros upon macros..?
[23:02:36] <mariari> I tend to just make funcitons around things with the part I care about
[23:02:42] <mariari> no I didn't even use macros here
[23:02:46] <mariari> https://github.com/mariari/Misc-Lisp-Scripts/blob/master/nyxt/init.lisp#L100
[23:02:52] <mariari> you can see the common function I use in line 84
[23:02:58] <mariari> then I pass the HOF around
[23:03:25] <hendursaga> Uh, HOF?
[23:03:27] <mariari> so you can factor out the search part of this then
[23:03:30] <mariari> higher order functions
[23:04:02] <mariari> you can see on line 86 I take a search-form which is just the identity
[23:04:11] <hendursaga> Is that... idiomatic though?
[23:04:17] <mariari> passing functions around?
[23:04:20] <mariari> yes
[23:04:24] <mariari> CL has a lot of HOF functions for example
[23:04:31] <mariari> (mapcar (lambda (x) (+ x 3)) (list 1 2 3 4 5))
[23:04:41] <hendursaga> I meant, the way you're using it here..
[23:05:04] <mariari> well how else do you factor out repeat behavior?
[23:05:06] <hendursaga> I haven't seen labels used before..
[23:05:14] <mariari> labels is quite common
[23:05:17] <mariari> have you used flet?
[23:05:55] <hendursaga> On occasion, I recall
[23:06:06] <hendursaga> Searching Nyxt code base it doesn't seem labels is used all that often..
[23:06:06] <mariari> labels is like flet but it can recurse
[23:06:12] <mariari> I could have used flet here actually
[23:06:25] <mariari> it's like making a local function defun
[23:06:30] <hendursaga> Ah, there's more flet refs..
[23:06:40] <mariari> so instead of saying (defun foo (x) (+ x 3)) to use foo internally
[23:06:43] <mariari> or using
[23:06:45] <mariari> (lambda (x) (+ x 3))
[23:06:46] <hendursaga> So, do you know much about CLOS?
[23:06:47] <mariari> you can say
[23:06:57] <mariari> I know a bit, read a bit of the meta object protocol
[23:07:13] <hendursaga> They say CLOS is one step below Smalltalk, which is saying something
[23:07:28] <mariari> I tend to use classes in CL when I want data to update live, and i use methods as a way to get interfaces of sorts in CL
[23:07:33] <mariari> it's very smalltalkish yes
[23:14:21] <mariari> yeah I see the pattern in the code I've simplified it a bit, do you know if I kept the semantics the same?
[23:15:22] <mariari> I believe after simplifying the functions a bit we end up with
[23:15:25] <mariari> https://ghostbin.lain.la/paste/ah7u9
[23:16:11] <mariari> since we are setfing the url directly I'm not sure if we need the last setf but I left it in there as it preserves what was written I think
[23:21:52] <mariari> If what I wrote was correct, then the replace-url-handler should be the generic version of it that we can rewrite the first two functions into
[23:39:25] <hendursaga> mariari: interesting, I was thinking of something along those lines, although I got distracted with CLOS :P
[23:40:04] <mariari> the one part CLOS may be useful for here is for the setf part, since we have a string or an url query depending on the type, so defmethod may be useful here :P
[23:42:31] <mariari> oh forgot to send in the list for replace-url-handler
[23:44:16] <hendursaga> mariari: defmethod is essentially parametric polymorphism right??
[23:44:23] <hendursaga> or am I mixing up my CS terms..
[23:44:27] <mariari> which one is parametric again
[23:44:42] <mariari> I think java guys use that term
[23:44:54] <hendursaga> as in, multiple dispatch sorta thing
[23:45:05] <mariari> oh... yeah you can dispatch on type
[23:45:20] <mariari> and even value IIRC. like you can dispatch based on a certain keyword symbol that you get
[23:45:36] <mariari> it's just a way of getting implicit resolution typically on a type
[23:45:41] <mariari> has some advance features
[23:45:54] <mariari> as you can do before methods and after methods and combinations if you are actually using CLOS
[23:46:17] <mariari> this works on multiple types as well, the first argument is not blessed like in java
[23:46:46] <mariari> I typically use it just for getting interface like functionality, so 1 function can work on multiple types and can grow
