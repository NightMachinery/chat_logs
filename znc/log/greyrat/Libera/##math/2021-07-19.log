[00:05:11] <mornfall> seems unlikely (calendars usually have week numbers in them tho)
[00:05:43] <RedNifre> Hm... let's simplify it to just knowing the month... then you have 12 weeks that move between months. There are 7 different starts of the week, adding leap years makes 14 different weeks... learning 162 bits of look up table seems not feasible.
[00:06:15] *** Joins: Crescendo (~Crescendo@user/crescendo)
[00:06:40] <RedNifre> Well, leap years don't matter that much, you would just use a different table for mid february to the end of the year, so 84 bits to remember?
[00:07:12] <RedNifre> Maybe it's easier to create a custom watch face for the smart watch that displays the week number :/

[04:10:55] <mouseghost> isnt it that these can differ with c?
[04:10:57] <mouseghost> idk
[04:11:24] <anovick> yea there is a C constant in the end of both results there
[04:12:04] <anovick> but there is no constant that makes the two results equivalent so it's a difference of more than a constant
[04:12:47] <mouseghost> ye nvm
[04:13:24] <qergle> anovick: it's right
[04:14:13] <anovick> qergle: thank you for checking!
[04:14:15] <qergle> integrating -y^3/(y^2+1) gives -y^2/2+ln(1+y^2)/2
[04:14:32] <qergle> and if you sub back in cos(x) for y, you get what you would expect.
[04:15:30] <anovick> qergle: yep exactly what I calculated there too...
[04:15:44] <anovick> so frustrating that WolframAlpha tells me I'm wrong :-(
[04:16:20] <qergle> as for W|A, check if cos(2x)=2cos^2(x)-1 makes it all work
[04:16:33] <anovick> ok one sec
[04:17:16] <qergle> (1/4)*-cos(2x) = (1/4)*(2*cos^2(x)-1) = 1/2*cos^2-1/4
[04:17:35] <qergle> oops, sign issue
[04:17:50] <qergle> (1/4)*-cos(2x) = (1/4)*(-2*cos^2(x)+1) = -1/2*cos^2+1/4
[04:18:11] <qergle> so now you've got a +1/4 that's off, see if you get from the other term
[04:19:18] <mouseghost> cant +1/4 be accounted in c tho?
[04:19:24] <mouseghost> idk im not thinking
[04:19:52] <qergle> yes, if it's indefinite it can. anyways, work it all out
[04:20:17] <anovick> qergle: very well done!
[04:20:30] <anovick> I forgot about the cos(2x) identity with cos(x)^2
[04:20:37] <anovick> came in handy there

[04:45:07] <CuriousErnestBro> that's why
[04:45:45] <CuriousErnestBro> det(A - λI) != 0 => empty nullspace of A-λI
[04:45:57] <CuriousErnestBro> because the matrix transformation preserves its volume
[04:48:01] <CuriousErnestBro> so I guess it's possible to have no eigenvalues?
[04:49:44] <frelleck> you always have complex eigenvalues but there can be no real eigenvalues
[04:49:47] <int-e> Well, if A is an nxn matrix then det(A - λI) is a polynomial of degree n in λ. If you're working over an algebraically complete field like the complex numbers, that gives you n eigenvalues (not necessarily distinct)
[04:49:48] <qergle> [0 -1;1 0] has no evalues over R
[04:50:23] <CuriousErnestBro> so having an eigenvalue means that your linear transformation matrix A is kind of degenerate in the sense that the "range" can have less "degrees of freedom" than the domain
[04:50:25] <qergle> you can come up with many quadratics with no real roots, that was just a simple one

[04:51:39] <CuriousErnestBro> hmmm
[04:51:41] <PlanckWalk> A is "degenerate" if it has 0 as an eigenvalue
[04:52:01] <CuriousErnestBro> wait a second
[04:52:08] <frelleck> degenerate means there's a nonzero vector v with Av = 0
[04:52:14] <frelleck> equivalently it's not one to one

We can't have nA = A for all integers n > 1, since this would make A divisible, but all nonzero torsionfree divisible groups are vector spaces over Q so those have non-cyclic nonzero proper subgroups. So say mA is a proper subgroup of A, for some fixed m > 1.  The homomorphism  x |-> mx

[06:51:45] <Z-module> int-e, that ~ way is quite pretty. My unpretty way was:  If G is infinite, then either:  (i) G is countable, and (i.a) all its cyclic subgroups are finite so there have to be at least aleph_0 of those, or else (i.b) it has a subgroup =~ Z which itself has aleph_0 distinct subroups;    or    (ii) G is uncountable in which case there must be |G| many distinct cyclic subgroups since those are all countable.
[06:52:04] <Fangs> are you guys working on a problem?
[06:53:19] <Fangs> Z-module: I think you can say a lot of stuff about profinite groups, so I wouldn't count 'structural facts abotu infinite groups' as inherently something that doesn't come up often

[07:29:23] <Galois> the usual example of a non-sigma-finite measure is: you want to assign probabilities to a countable set of events, such that any single event has probability 0, but the entire set has probability 1.
[07:29:42] <Galois> for example, "pick a random rational number in the interval [0,1]"
[07:30:08] <Galois> for what should be obvious reasons, there does not exist any sigma-finite measure satisfying the stated properties

[07:34:49] <frelleck> just use the discrete measure on an uncountable set
[07:35:01] <frelleck> I don't know how natural that is but it's an easy example
[07:35:14] <greenbagels> i think i might be asking this question prematurely; maybe i should get comfortable with different examples of measures before thinking about it
[07:36:32] <Galois> you can also take the borel/lebesgue measure on the long line
[07:36:57] <greenbagels> its kind of cool that any countably additive function on an algebra of sets can be extended to a measure on the sigma algebra generated by that algebra; that seems like a strong statement to make
[07:37:17] <greenbagels> i cant wait for the appendix to hit me with a 5 page proof
[07:37:29] <frelleck> it's pretty icky iirc
[07:37:32] <frelleck> uses outer measures
[07:38:44] <greenbagels> it is in fact a 5 page proof

[14:21:54] <lisp123> I want to understand better how to determine whether an assumption in a set of assumptions is REQUIRED for a proof or is superfluous to the probelm at hand
[14:22:23] <lisp123> e.g.  x = 5 & y = 6 & z = 7, therefore x + y = 11 (z is completely unrelated)
[14:22:39] <lisp123> But not just for this simple example, but more generally to all proofs
[14:22:49] <lisp123> Can anybody point me in the right direction?
[14:25:15] <lieven> you can try to find counterexamples to theorems if you leave out one of the assumptions
[14:25:29] *** Quits: quarterback (~quarterba@user/quarterback) (Quit: Leaving)
[14:25:49] <int-e> lisp123: well, an assumption is superfluous if there's a proof not using the assumption. so identifying required assumptions seems more useful, and you can do that by finding counterexamples to the theorem without the assumption in question

[16:37:05] <lieven> there's a famous result in number theory where the proof goes as follows: assume the Riemann hypothesis. ... result follows. Assume the negation of the Riemann hypothesis. ... result follows.
[16:37:16] <Capso> If X_j are random variables on R^n with law P and g is a function on R^n, then we know the expectation of Y_j = g(X_j) is int g(x) dP(x). But what about the expectaion of a sum, Z_j = (1/j) sum_k=1^j X_j? is it the anticipated double integral?
[16:37:22] <lieven> intuitively one feels there should be a proof not mentioning RH
[16:40:09] <mornfall> lieven: would you say that any proof with case analysis should intuitively exist in a version without case analysis?
[16:40:26] <nejimban> Capso: more or less the same formula but with P being the law of the vector (X_1,…,X_j)
[16:41:21] <nejimban> ∫ g((x1+···+xj)/j) dP(x1,…,xj)
[16:43:42] <Capso> oops, I need another variable: if k is a function on R^2n and we define, Z_j = (1/j) sum^j k(x,X_k) k(X_j, X_k)? what is E[Z]?
