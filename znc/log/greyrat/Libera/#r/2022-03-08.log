[00:01:07] <Bayes> Ah I found an interesting bit on correlation the other day...
[00:02:38] *** Joins: mnl (~mnl@user/mnl)
[00:08:09] <Bayes> here, it took me a while to get my head spinning on this one https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation_matrix#Definition
[00:09:02] <Bayes> for reference, this is the equivalent definition for the correlation between two random scalars x, y https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation#Definition
[00:10:28] <Bayes> what surprised me is that the correlation for random scalars X, Y is basically a normalized difference between the expectation of the product and the product of the expectations, i.e., E[XY] - E[X]E[Y]
[00:11:26] <Bayes> but for two random vectors, it's defined only in terms of the expectation of the product
[00:12:17] <rickyrick> There's a vector form for covariance
[00:12:31] <rickyrick> Cov[X,Y] = E[XY'] - E[X]E[Y]'
[00:12:50] <Bayes> yeah, and that's mentioned below
[00:13:02] <Bayes> here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation_matrix#Relation_to_the_cross-covariance_matrix
[00:13:27] <rickyrick> I think it's confusing that the cross-correlation matrix isn't really a correlation
[00:13:33] <Bayes> yeah totally that
[00:13:42] <Bayes> that's exactly what I'm getting at
[00:13:47] <Bayes> it's just the expectation of a product
[00:14:07] <rickyrick> :^)
[00:14:11] <Bayes> I was hoping to get the vectors X, Y to be normalized and centered or something
[00:14:26] <Bayes> well not hoping, but expecting
[00:16:22] <Bayes> unfortunately the reference given in wikipedia is a Electrical and Computer Engineers book
[00:16:36] <Bayes> I was hoping for a statistical reference

[19:11:56] <fendur> personally, i'd review it for complicating things like run-ons that cause confusion. my take is usually if a reviewer notices it, other readers will to.
[19:12:12] <fendur> too
[19:12:56] <fendur> i.e., consider finding ways to lower the brain burden of groking the material. shorter sentences are often a big help.

[23:38:04] <shrysr> i am not actually clear of the pandoc dependence or connection with RMarkdown. I do not recall explicitly needing to install pandoc in the past. The knitr package apparently has no mention of pandoc either..  cc: Bayes
[23:38:55] <shrysr> hmm when I see the last verbose command after hitting knit, i see pandoc is bundled with rstudio
[23:39:45] <shrysr> it is in /usr/lib/rstudio/bin/pandoc/
[23:40:07] <shrysr> thats kindda cheeky dontcha think ?
[23:46:27] <twrk> I love having pandoc installed, so that every pacman update has at least 30 haskell packages
[23:47:02] <shrysr> I have a question for you guys. Say over time you develop a buncha R scripts..,.. some run everyday, most are one time solutions to problems, that may or may not be used in the future. commits to the repo are tagged by.. ticket number. So  --- How do you manage these R scripts?
[23:47:47] <twrk> wdym manage, like organize?
[23:49:47] <twrk> new linux update: allow 'hashtags' in filenames for today's youths way of organizing. file name "does all the major handling of certain process #software #framework #ggplot2
[23:50:02] <twrk> sry, I dont twitter
[23:50:15] <shrysr> I mean do you maintain an additional README or master Rmarkdown document that can launch the scripts? Well to provide some context, the chief architect at $work has proclaimed scripts are messy .. and hard to manage a large number. I'm trying to suggest ways to mitigate. One way is packages. But that works only when there is a sufficient.. commonality.
