[00:01:56] <bookworm> a container is really nothing special printf
[00:02:10] <bookworm> you can install all the same tools there
[00:02:51] <bookworm> considering that you have your logs in a volume anyhow you can even use a second container if you so choose
[00:04:21] <Snuupy> 02:27:33 PM <printf> but need to install an sqlite3 client to open it up and delete it, but since im using the docker container i cant run that command :/
[00:04:21] <Snuupy> you can, docker exec -it <container> <command>
[00:04:36] <Snuupy> in your cron or whatever you wanna run you can do docker exec -it thelounge sqlite...yada yada
[00:04:49] <printf> yea  ive docker exec into it and installed sqlite 
[00:04:56] <printf> and ive added a cronjob 
[00:05:08] <bookworm> which first stops TL right?
[00:05:24] <printf> do i have to stop thelounge service first though
[00:05:24] <bookworm> you really don't wanna try and write while TL still runs
[00:05:27] <bookworm> yes
[00:05:38] <bookworm> sqlite only allows a single writer
[00:05:45] <bookworm> least how we run ot
[00:05:48] <bookworm> it*
[00:06:20] <printf> man...  i feel like thelounge devs REALLY should consider this as a feature
[00:06:29] <bookworm> yes
[00:06:42] <bookworm> luckily you can be a dev too :)
[00:06:46] <bookworm> open source and all
[00:11:22] <printf> bookworm well how do u do it, or you dont rotate the logs
[00:12:30] <bookworm> If TL becomes sluggish I nuke the sqlite db, so far only had to do it once. Although considering the disc space usage I'll probably do it soon-ish again
[00:12:43] <bookworm> I log via znc for archiving purposes
[00:13:51] <bookworm> we should indeed add the pruning of the db, however there are quite a few edge cases to consider plus our DB schema is suboptimal for that
[00:14:26] <bookworm> now, fixing it certainly is possible but you need to absolutely make sure that you aren't accidentally messing up peoples databases for obvious reasons
[00:14:41] <bookworm> some may actually consider them important
[00:16:01] <bookworm> also, we would need to vacuum to actually release space in the first place, but for this to actually succeed you need at least 1.5x or so storage on top. Considering people run TL on rather small toasters how do you handle that?
[00:16:38] <bookworm> those are things that need to be figured out
[00:17:09] <printf> apart from nuking is there a way to like cap max number of messages per channels
[00:17:22] <bookworm> not in the DB no, in RAM yes
[00:17:33] <printf> so like max messages per channel :  -1 (unlimited) , and u can set to something like 1000
[00:17:47] <bookworm> if you are concerned about storage use, don't join #news
[00:18:05] <printf> yea ive left ##news 
[00:18:06] <bookworm> it's a firehose you won't read anyway
[00:18:25] <printf> just using it as a general news feed
[00:18:30] <bookworm> Use a RSS reader and join feeds you actually look at
[00:18:48] <printf> is there one thats as good as the one in ##news, 
[00:18:59] <bookworm> miniflux is nice, if you anyhow already host TL might as well host that too
[00:19:15] <printf> cuz ##news seems to pull news from all sorts of sources and countries
[00:19:32] <bookworm> news is shit as you can't filter the feeds, anyhow let's do this in offtopic
[00:19:47] <printf> #thelounge-offtopic?
[00:19:52] <bookworm> yes
[00:20:16] <bookworm> as for the message limit, as said this just concerns what's stored in RAM
[00:20:40] <bookworm> it limits the resource usage of the running process but won't save your disc

[00:33:18] <bookworm> yes, you'll still fetch them from the sqlite db

[10:31:18] <fnutt> I mean - we both use the same irc framework and node js. So... uhm... they might have found a solution we can use to make it happen? or? 😃
[10:34:31] <MaxLeiter> It’s difficult due to Vue-router limitations 
[10:35:28] <fnutt> Ah, I see.

[12:10:17] <fnutt> Ah, alright.
[12:10:22] <bookworm> those aren't in the corresponding map we setup, should be easy to fix
[12:10:33] <fnutt> I assume irc-framework should handle this?

[19:45:23] <bookworm> eliocamp: depends, you have (on upload) the case that they could dos your storage, afaik only the size per upload is limited not the total storage per user (I may be wrong). On download TL tries to sniff the mime type and sets the display inline vs download property, on master you also shove it into sharp if it's an image so that may be a thing
[19:45:23] <bookworm> they can hijack if you are very unlucky and the parser has a bug. If it's an inline thing, the client again shoves it in a decoder which again might have bugs but considering the internet that's relatively unlikely (google aggressively fuzzes that code, so do lots of security researchers)
[19:45:32] <bookworm> as usual, threat model

[19:47:29] <bookworm> if the uploaded blob is not an inline type (audio, image...) the security problem is again client side (don't open a random binary blob, nor a pdf or anything else with problematic security properties)

[19:55:32] <eliocamp3> bookworm, If i understood what you're saying is that the only danger for the server would be someone uploading too many files and filling up diskspace? And in terms of malicious files the main risk is for the users?
[19:55:37] *** eliocamp3 is now known as eliocamp
[19:56:17] <bookworm> that and (on master) sharp/libvips might have a bug in the decoder upon malicious input
[19:56:27] <bookworm> other than that, yes I think so
[19:56:36] <bookworm> the obvious ones at least
[19:58:33] <eliocamp> Thanks. Ok. We'll have to think about it, then. 
[19:59:20] <bookworm> in your shoes, I'd probably not enable it
[19:59:39] <bookworm> if it's really needed they can always use google drive or whatever and share the link
[19:59:42] <eliocamp> Yep. I'm leaning towards it. There's not a lot to gain.
[19:59:48] <bookworm> right
