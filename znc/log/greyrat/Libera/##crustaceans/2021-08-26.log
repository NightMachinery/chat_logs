[00:00:13] <manicennui> I don't because I don't think the way I work is at all methodical.
[00:00:18] <manicennui> And I learned everything on my own.
[00:00:24] <manicennui> I don't know how to teach other people.
[00:00:53] <prussian> today? oh I just made up excuse I was busy. idk. I just don't know what is expected of me and he isn't exactly sure what he wants to learn.
[00:01:22] <prussian> bit creepy, sounds sort of like me when 10 years ago
[00:01:37] <prussian> 15:30 < manicennui> And I learned everything on my own.
[00:01:39] <prussian> so true ^
[00:02:05] <manicennui> I guess my mentors were book authors.
[00:02:55] <indigo> Yeah... I also never had a "mentor"
[00:04:19] <prussian> last time I met I basically shared my screen and did stuff and explained things like a mile a minute. then since he mentioned he installed gentoo at some time, I sort of tangently went off about how it relates. also shared with him: https://funroll-loops.probablymalware.lol/Gentoo-is-Rice.html
[00:04:23] <buttsbot> Welcome to Gentoo is Rice, the Volume goes to 11 here.
[00:04:36] *** Joins: mouseghost (~draco@user/mouseghost)
[00:05:03] <prussian> too young for the peak of the gentoo.
[00:05:39] <indigo> And this is for work?
[00:05:43] <prussian> yes kek
[00:06:18] <prussian> I'm making it up as I go.
[00:07:56] <manicennui> I have a weekly "tech huddle" which is where only the engineers on my team get together and discuss design/implementation issues, and half the time it turns into me rambling for 30+ minutes.
[00:08:07] <prussian> sounds about right
[00:08:20] <prussian> ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
[00:08:31] <dasm> manicennui: did yoou try **not** rambling?
[00:08:31] <manicennui> But they seem to like it.
[00:08:37] <manicennui> dasm: Nah.
[00:08:44] <manicennui> I'm a pretty good rambler.
[00:08:46] *** Joins: riv (~river@tilde.team/user/river)
[00:08:47] <dasm> overrated? :)
[00:08:55] <manicennui> They all tell our boss that they love being on my team.
[00:08:58] <prussian> I have a planner for what we wanted to go over, just haven't really done good job teaching it.
[00:09:06] <manicennui> So I guess I'm doing something right.
[00:09:08] <prussian> too much to learn perhaps.
[00:09:14] <prussian> epic
[00:09:18] <prussian> best you can do.

[00:10:12] <riv> i dont get the point of this
[00:10:23] <manicennui> A couple of years ago I decided that I didn't care whether they fired me, I wasn't going to deal with bullshit, and I have enough money saved to survive for a few years.
[00:10:45] <prussian> riv: of?
[00:10:55] <manicennui> So my team is a bit different than the other teams.
[00:10:56] <prussian> dasm: beautiful
[00:11:31] <dasm> indeed
[00:11:49] <prussian> manicennui: THIS
[00:11:50] <manicennui> I keep enough ceremony to keep the company at large happy, but we basically do kanban.
[00:11:55] <prussian> the fire thing
[00:12:14] <manicennui> I get people to focus on actual priorities, even if I have to be a bit of a dick about it once in a while.
[00:12:25] <dasm> i was stupid. i should go into 2 jobs, instead of leaving last one i had.
[00:12:45] <dasm> i was doing notihg for about 3-4 months, and then everyone wanted everything because of "release"
[00:13:06] <manicennui> I'm sure I'm not everyone's favorite person at the company, but my team is pretty low stress.
[00:13:06] <prussian> haha
[00:13:08] <dasm> but, it's too late :)
[00:14:25] <prussian> i think I saw a hn comment where some guy said he was working 10 jobs and basically just collecting as much as he could before being fired.
[00:14:31] <manicennui> heh
[00:14:37] <prussian> real hero....
[00:15:01] <manicennui> I've had some Indian coworkers tell me that there are people who do that in banking somehow.
[00:15:17] <manicennui> Like savings and loans banking, not investment.
[00:15:20] <dasm> heh
[00:15:43] <manicennui> I think they are contractors.
[00:17:54] <dasm> for some reason, i prefer to have less work than more :)
[00:18:07] <dasm> maybe i'm doing something wrong?
[00:19:18] <manicennui> Nah, that's the way to go.
[00:19:32] <manicennui> Unless you can get paid way more for more work, and not have to work overtime.
[00:19:42] <manicennui> Keeping busy does make the day go by faster.

[00:21:55] <buttsbot> OnlyFans Drops Planned Porn Ban, Will Allow Sexually Explicit Content - Variety
[00:22:17] <manicennui> Looks like porn is back on the menu!
[00:22:47] <manicennui> They probably saw all of the people planning to leave.
[00:23:33] <prussian> can't find the comment. not sure why not. ugh
[00:23:41] <companion_cube> just shows how badly they knew their userbase?!
[00:23:56] <companion_cube> their userbaise if I may
[00:24:07] <manicennui> I don't know what they were thinking.
[00:24:08] <prussian> probably just an ad campaign.
[00:24:15] <prussian> no such thing as bad publicity?
[00:24:19] <prussian> na mean?
[00:24:35] <prussian> I mean, it literally went viral fast
[00:25:05] <manicennui> ‚ÄúOnlyFans stands for inclusion and we will continue to provide a home for all creators,‚Äù the company said.
[00:25:06] <prussian> hell, I sometimes wonder if that basecamp CEO said that stupid crap with the same goal... speaking of which, I always wanted like the follow-up after the big controversy stories hit
[00:25:20] <manicennui> prussian: There is a follow up.
[00:25:25] <prussian> oh.
[00:25:30] <manicennui> Jason Fried was on Sam Harris's podcast.
[00:25:32] <manicennui> They are doing well.
[00:25:34] <prussian> must have missed i
[00:25:34] <prussian> t
[00:25:40] <manicennui> Bunch of people left, tons of people want to work there.
[00:25:47] <dasm> just to repeat myself: "why porn sites won't just add 'paid' section?"
[00:25:50] <prussian> and the wheel keeps on turning.
[00:25:51] <prussian> lol
[00:25:57] <manicennui> dasm: They do.
[00:25:58] <prussian> se la vi
[00:26:15] <manicennui> https://samharris.org/podcasts/253-corporate-courage/
[00:26:16] <buttsbot> Making Sense Podcast #253 - Corporate Courage | Sam Harris
[00:26:25] <prussian> COURAGE
[00:26:26] <prussian> love it.
[00:26:51] <dasm> manicennui: so it shouldn't be an issue to just start publishing "somewhere else"? :)
[00:27:09] <manicennui> dasm: These are basically amateurs.
[00:27:15] <manicennui> Porn self publishing.
[00:27:22] <manicennui> It's not easy to receive payment for porn.
[00:27:41] <dasm> i know it's kinda difficult to get a payment for legit services too.
[00:27:48] <prussian> there have been a lot of law suits, abuse and other things around it. probably why there is so much taboo and hardship in it
[00:27:49] <dasm> so i'm not surprised that it could be more difficult for porn
[00:27:55] <manicennui> Onlyfans also takes a huge cut.
[00:28:08] <manicennui> When you learn how much money they make it all seems even more asinine that they would cut porn.
[00:28:35] <dasm> "internet is for porn" (signing song)
[00:28:38] <dasm> *singing
[00:28:43] <prussian> manicennui: do I want to listen to this podcast or skip?
[00:29:09] <manicennui> Maybe their payment processors expressed concerns, but announcing that they were going to ban porn was basically announcing that they were going out of business, and they were obviously able to resolve things.
[00:29:13] <prussian> i don't know anything about sam harris lol
[00:29:15] <manicennui> prussian: I don't know you well enough to answer that.
[00:29:27] <manicennui> I like Sam Harris, but he has positions that upset some poeple.
[00:29:29] <manicennui> people
[00:29:49] <manicennui> He's anti-Trump, but seems a bit too concerned with cancel culture.
[00:29:50] <prussian> literally nothing can upset me. I've seen and associate with a pretty wide gamut of people.
[00:29:55] <companion_cube> weren't people discussing investing, here? as a form of retirement plan etc.
[00:30:06] <manicennui> companion_cube: Maybe?
[00:30:12] <manicennui> I mentioned something.
[00:30:19] <prussian> companion_cube: sure.
[00:30:27] <prussian> buy bitcoin, moon mission, or something
[00:30:30] <companion_cube> :DDD
[00:30:34] <prussian> (not investment advice)
[00:30:41] <Geekingfrog> s/moon/mars/
[00:30:43] <manicennui> That's gambling advice.
[00:30:44] <companion_cube> I wonder if, more seriously, y'all have some basic reading to recommend
[00:30:59] <prussian> Geekingfrog: ü§Ø
[00:31:00] <companion_cube> I do need to get more serious about personal finance
[00:31:00] <dasm> wait... does it mean i need to sell my gamestop stonks?
[00:31:05] <dasm> shiit...
[00:31:09] <manicennui> I don't know of a specific book or blog or whatever, but it's pretty basic.
[00:31:28] <companion_cube> if you can earn money from it, it's not basic :p
[00:31:35] <prussian> I just run a double entry book, that's my finance. it's annoying since banks hate you and make it hard to dump things into it
[00:31:35] <manicennui> You really should just be buying a few different types of funds, max out your 401k, etc.
[00:31:41] <manicennui> companion_cube: It really is.
[00:31:55] <manicennui> The most trivial version is: put money in an S&P index fund.
[00:32:00] <manicennui> Leave it there for a long time.
[00:32:01] <prussian> I use to have a puppeteer bot auto fill details, but then fidelity started banning my IPs
[00:32:17] <prussian> SPY... yes.
[00:32:24] <manicennui> Slightly more complicated is find a few more diverse funds to split your money between.
[00:32:27] <prussian> not bad advice, but it feels, oh so wrong.
[00:32:35] <manicennui> Little bit of bonds, little bit of more focused stock funds, etc.
[00:32:35] <prussian> but it works
[00:32:48] <manicennui> Don't get caught up in trading individual stocks.
[00:33:02] <manicennui> And these days, buy ETFs, not mutual funds.
[00:33:04] <prussian> ahhh spy, what would I do without you: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY
[00:33:05] <buttsbot> SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) Stock Price, News, Quote & History - Yahoo Finance
[00:33:10] <manicennui> At least for things like index funds.
[00:33:20] <prussian> ya.
[00:33:21] <manicennui> Just no reason to pay fund managers a bunch of money to manage an index fund.
[00:33:34] <prussian> i only have stupid funds because of 401k bs
[00:33:41] <prussian> THIS
[00:34:00] <manicennui> And if there is an emergency, it is easy to sell ETFs.
[00:34:30] <manicennui> With your 401k, max out on employer match, pick 3-5 varied funds.
[00:34:36] <prussian> in dot-com, I know boomers who complained to me that their funds liquidated and gave them big fat tax events. lol
[00:34:44] <prussian> rip...
[00:35:05] <manicennui> Most 401k sites will recommend funds.
[00:35:13] <prussian> I basically contribue the max that keeps me in the lowest tax bracket reasonable.
[00:35:13] <manicennui> And they are generally fine.
[00:35:14] <companion_cube> manicennui: i think you overestimate my basic knowledge, but sure, noted :D
[00:35:28] <bkero> lowest tax bracket? O_o
[00:35:41] <prussian> income tax is graduated.
[00:35:44] <bkero> You know that works in buckets, right? You don't suddenly pay the next bracket up on all your income if you're $1 into it.
[00:35:49] <prussian> true
[00:36:01] <manicennui> Yeah, I shoot for the highest tax brackets.
[00:36:04] <prussian> but the money best put to work than get taxed more
[00:36:08] <manicennui> Still have a few to go.
[00:36:08] <prussian> well
[00:36:10] <prussian> "Work"
[00:36:12] <prussian> lol
[00:36:17] <prussian> bkero: yes.
[00:36:40] <manicennui> Actually I have two to go.
[00:36:47] <prussian> soon...
[00:36:55] <manicennui> With my bonus I break into the third highest.
[00:37:20] <manicennui> Unlikely that I'll break into the second highest working for someone else.
[00:37:36] <manicennui> At least not without getting West Coast money.
[00:38:06] <manicennui> But my mortgage interest also knocks that down a bit.
[00:39:47] <prussian> damn.
[00:40:25] <manicennui> companion_cube: Really high level overview: https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/investment/
[00:40:26] <buttsbot> Finding investments | Vanguard
[00:40:33] <manicennui> I highly recommend Vanguard funds.
[00:40:58] <manicennui> You can get an account wherever and buy ETFs for free these days.
[00:41:19] <manicennui> You could do worse than investing 75% in VOO and 25% in BND to start.
[00:41:25] <manicennui> Then read more and figure out how to diversify.
[00:41:26] <companion_cube> seems useful, thanks a lot
[00:42:14] <manicennui> I have investment accounts with Fidelity, Ally, and Etrade. They are all decent enough.
[00:42:32] <manicennui> I like Ally just because I use their other services too.
[00:42:36] <companion_cube> is that better than investing throught one's normal bank?
[00:42:43] <companion_cube> (if it's a usual thing)
[00:42:43] <manicennui> But their trading site is not at all sophisticated.
[00:42:49] <manicennui> But I don't actually want anything complicated.
[00:43:11] <manicennui> If your bank offers investment accounts it is certainly something to consider as long as their fees are good.
[00:43:20] <companion_cube> ah, good point.
[00:43:30] <manicennui> https://www.ally.com/invest/self-directed-trading/?linkTo=choices-and-pricing&setPanel=first-ic-panel
[00:43:30] <buttsbot> Online Trading: Trade Stocks, Options, ETFs | Ally Invest¬Æ
[00:43:39] <manicennui> Lot of places do free trades now.
[00:43:44] <manicennui> You don't have to use Robinhood.
[00:43:58] <companion_cube> they seem‚Ä¶ scammy, anyway
[00:44:11] <manicennui> I would not worry about options and such right now (if ever).
[00:44:25] <prussian> ^
[00:44:53] <manicennui> And realize that it can take several days to sell a stock and move the cash to your checking account or whatever.
[00:45:04] <manicennui> So don't invest every penny you have.
[00:45:05] <companion_cube> above you said 75% VOO, but it seems riskier than BND? just curious
[00:45:07] <companion_cube> ahah yeah
[00:45:14] <companion_cube> I'm super risk averse, I'd only move parts of my savings
[00:45:21] <manicennui> VOO is an S&P index fund.
[00:45:30] <manicennui> If the S&P fails over the long term, everything is fucked.
[00:45:35] <manicennui> BND is low risk, very low reward.
[00:45:39] <companion_cube> just by the "risk potential" on the vanguard page, I mean :)
[00:45:43] <companion_cube> right.
[00:46:02] <manicennui> Yeah, but you have to realize that the S&P 500 is adjusted over time with companies that are doing well.
[00:46:17] <manicennui> So it's not as though they just watch Sears tank and run itself into the ground and keep it in the index.
[00:46:35] <manicennui> Very few investors beat the S&P 500.
[00:46:49] <manicennui> The only thing to be aware of is that there will be down months.
[00:46:56] <manicennui> But you really shouldn't be thinking about that for requirement.
[00:47:06] <manicennui> And with dividend reinvesting, you will gain shares.
[00:47:08] <companion_cube> only long term matters
[00:47:15] <manicennui> When you get older, you can switch to cash out dividends.
[00:47:26] <manicennui> s/requirement/retirement/
[00:47:49] <manicennui> It's all about the long term compounding.

[00:49:09] <manicennui> You can see where it has dipped.
[00:49:24] <manicennui> Which are almost always when there is a major economic event.
[00:49:29] <manicennui> Like the 2008 housing market crash.
[00:49:48] <prussian> almost beautiful isn't it?
[00:50:13] <manicennui> So that's what VOO attempts to track.
[00:50:17] <companion_cube> indeed, nice dip in 2008
[00:50:23] <manicennui> And I'm not saying invest 75% in VOO forever.
[00:50:31] <manicennui> But it wouldn't be a bad first investment.
[00:51:02] <manicennui> And it's basically as "safe" as the US economy.
[00:51:16] <companion_cube> right
[00:51:22] <bkero> SHMP
[00:51:26] <bkero> All in on SHMP
[00:51:38] * manicennui hopes this is a stock for shrimps.

[00:52:16] <manicennui> It is shrimp.
[00:52:20] <manicennui> OTC stock.

[00:53:27] <prussian> let's gooooooooooooooooooo
[00:54:12] <manicennui> I mean they may or may not be a good company.
[00:54:27] <manicennui> Yahoo Finance doesn't seem to know what their revenue is.
[00:55:34] <prussian> it's definitely the kind of penny stock i'd expect people to gamble on.
[00:56:10] <manicennui> Looks like they are just dumping money into R&D and don't have revenue yet.

[00:58:11] <bkero> (alright I've got them to pump, now time to dump)
[00:58:15] <prussian> lol
[00:58:19] <bkero> I kid, I have no position on SHMP
[00:58:33] <manicennui> 1000 shares baby.
[00:58:39] <manicennui> We'll see if the order executes tomorrow.
[00:59:57] <manicennui> I think we should pump this stock up in the topic since it is clearly related to this channel's name.
[00:59:58] <companion_cube> :DDD go shrimp
[01:00:12] <manicennui> And it actually sounds like an interesting company that is trying to do something sustainable.
[01:00:38] <prussian> lmao. fidelity stopped me and is making me read a statement about penny stocks.
[01:00:41] * manicennui is going to be just like Forest Gump.
[01:01:03] <manicennui> Ally just made me place a limit order because the market is closed.
[01:01:05] <indigo> SHMP has already shown up on wsb apparently
[01:01:08] <prussian> idgi... I have enough in this account to not be flagged.
[01:01:28] <manicennui> It knows that shrimp are hot right now.
[01:01:33] <prussian> lmao
[01:01:39] <manicennui> Seriously, was this mentioned on reddit?

[01:02:03] <bkero> Hahahahahaha
[01:02:04] <manicennui> bkero: Where did this hot tip come from?
[01:02:18] <bkero> A friends' Discord channel.
[01:02:29] <bkero> I don't read WSB but they might
[01:02:43] <bkero> (it's just a friends discord server)
[01:04:19] <prussian> the reddit link won't load.
[01:04:36] <prussian> i still am floored that trading is basically $0 commission
[01:04:40] <manicennui> Actually, on second though, I'll cancel the order.
[01:04:44] <manicennui> Look at their 6m graph.
[01:04:44] <prussian> i will buy 35 dollars of this lol
[01:05:00] <prussian> ya it already dumped it appears
[01:05:11] <indigo> Hot tip: VTSAX / VTIAX and chill
[01:05:27] <prussian> my portfolio is basically all SPY and QQQ
[01:05:42] <manicennui> If you could have bought it at the bottom, you could have made something.
[01:05:46] <manicennui> And it has been up for the last week.
[01:05:52] <prussian> and contrafund, which someone sold me on.
[01:05:54] <manicennui> Maybe I'll buy like 100 shares.
[01:06:36] <manicennui> Damn, Ally requires a minimum $100 for OTC.
[01:07:13] <prussian> rip
[01:07:18] <manicennui> I had a mix of popular funds, and a bit of COST.
[01:07:34] <manicennui> I sold most of the funds and all of the COST to free some money up for a potential real estate purchase.
[01:07:56] <manicennui> Made between 4 and 25% return on everything over the last 4+ months.
[01:08:18] <prussian> ok. I got an order for 100 SHMP at $0.35/ea let's GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoo
[01:08:22] <prussian> MOON MISSION
[01:08:34] <prussian> well I feel stupid now
[01:09:03] <prussian> manicennui: nice.
[01:09:16] <manicennui> Just didn't want it all sitting in savings.
[01:09:28] <prussian> ya. I got that problem right now.
[01:09:35] <prussian> i will put it all on SHMP
[01:09:41] * manicennui remembers when online savings accounts paid 5%+ during the dotcom boom.
[01:09:51] <manicennui> prussian: Sounds totally responsible.
[01:09:54] <prussian> https://www.reddit.com/r/SHMP/comments/n3902f/real_shmp_512021/ this post did not inspire confidence though...
[01:09:55] <buttsbot> Real Shmp- 5-1-2021 : SHMP
[01:10:02] <prussian> looks kinda dumpy
[01:10:21] <manicennui> Industrial sites don't tend to look fancy.
[01:10:26] <prussian> true
[01:10:26] <manicennui> They aren't all spacex.
[01:10:48] <prussian> I remember my mom telling me a car loan had an 19% rate on it.
[01:11:15] <prussian> weird time
[01:11:21] <manicennui> Some people can't get better rates.
[01:11:31] <prussian> well this was like late 80s
[01:11:35] <manicennui> I wouldn't pay more than 0% on a car probably.
[01:11:59] <prussian> allegedly the scam with the 0% is they frontload the interest they want in the sale price.
[01:12:20] <manicennui> https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/best-car-deals
[01:12:22] <prussian> or so I heard. I too have a car payment only because it was extended to me as 0% for 72months
[01:12:24] <manicennui> Several options for 0%.
[01:12:36] <manicennui> And I could just wait until the car I want has some kind of deal.
[01:12:49] <manicennui> Yeah, free money is worth taking even if you could just pay it off.
[01:13:06] <manicennui> If I move to NC I'll need a car.
[01:13:11] <manicennui> I'd like to not pay taxes here.
[01:13:16] <manicennui> Thinking of ways to avoid that.
[01:13:24] <manicennui> I'd probably have to rent until I have residency there.
[01:13:56] <prussian> suck thing is my insurance premium is full so it's like 1k a year
[01:14:17] <prussian> damn.
[01:14:42] <manicennui> That's not terrible.
[01:14:49] <manicennui> I don't know that I could pay that little here.
[01:15:18] <prussian> plus the great state of CT put property taxes on cars. this year I paid like $450 for it.
[01:15:28] <prussian> well
[01:15:31] <prussian> the towns do
[01:15:50] <prussian> can't imagine owning like some luxury car here.
[01:16:12] <manicennui> Definitely not looking forward to owning a car again, although I'd like to be able to go places without dealing with public transportation and uber.
[01:16:18] <manicennui> Just not worth having a car here at all.
[01:16:51] <manicennui> I'll probably drive to state/national parks in NC if I move there.
[01:17:00] <manicennui> And grocery shopping will be easier.
[01:17:08] <manicennui> Maybe get a Costco membership finally.
[01:17:09] <prussian> ya
[01:17:26] <manicennui> Renting a car while I'm there next week of course.
[01:17:26] <prussian> costco is good if you got a big ass freezer
[01:17:35] <manicennui> What if I shit a lot?
[01:17:39] <prussian> well.
[01:17:44] <prussian> they have a solution to that too
[01:17:55] <manicennui> I'd use it a lot for "household items".
[01:17:57] <prussian> bulk paper goods
[01:17:59] <manicennui> And a little for food.
[01:18:20] <manicennui> I've heard good things about their meat and such.
[01:18:24] <prussian> I use to go to get giant bags of mystery chicken meat and large jugs of something non perishable like peanut butter
[01:18:27] <prussian> and other such things
[01:18:36] <manicennui> Want to get into cooking more, and I could see having a few different things in my freezer.
[01:18:40] <manicennui> Not that I can't get them elsewhere.
[01:18:50] <prussian> gave it up since no costco near me, but they are opening one in the town next over soon
[01:19:25] <manicennui> Damn, there isn't actually a Costco near Asheville.
[01:19:30] <prussian> rip.
[01:19:33] <manicennui> Oh well.
[01:19:38] <prussian> the gas prices are usually cheap too.
[01:20:03] <manicennui> I'm contemplating whether I want to contact a real estate agent while I'm there next week.
[01:20:06] <prussian> costco's gas station operations are very involved. they can have sites with like 20 or more USTs I've heard
[01:20:06] <manicennui> Look at a few places.
[01:20:21] <manicennui> UST?
[01:20:27] <prussian> underground storage tank
[01:20:41] <prussian> they use microwave to communicate with some of the tank gauges monitoring them too.
[01:20:45] <manicennui> Mmm, capitalism.
[01:21:03] <prussian> i guess they're *really* big some sites.
[01:21:20] <manicennui> I owned some of their stock because I like that they try to be better than other stores.
[01:21:35] <manicennui> But I might need some cash soon, and 25% is a good enough return.

[01:26:05] <buttsbot> A Random Walk Down Wall Street: The Time-Tested Strategy for Successful Investing: Malkiel, Burton G.: 9781324002185: Amazon.com: Books
[01:26:22] <manicennui> I've never read it, so I can't give you my thoughts.
[01:26:59] <manicennui> "Malkiel shows why an individual who buys over time and holds a low-cost, internationally diversified index of securities is still likely to exceed the performance of portfolios carefully picked by professionals using sophisticated analytical techniques."
[01:27:09] <manicennui> The description generally sounds great.
[01:28:35] <prussian> it just feels so wrong. but it works...
[01:28:51] <indigo> Unless, of course, the professional is in possession of a time machine
[01:28:59] <prussian> well, ya lol

[01:29:30] <prussian> oh god, don't remind me of the whole GAME STONK elon thing
[01:29:48] <prussian> ok done working so i'm gonna go.

[01:32:31] <manicennui> "he formed a band of American Indian, White and African-American men to wage a guerrilla war against the white establishment from 1864 to 1872"
[01:32:33] <manicennui> Sweet.
[01:32:54] <manicennui> I'm coasting until my vacation.
[01:33:03] <manicennui> Just have to make it through tomorrow.
[01:33:58] <indigo> How long are you off for?
[01:34:24] <manicennui> Until after Labor Day.
[01:34:44] <manicennui> Just over a week.
[01:34:57] <indigo> Right on
[01:35:23] <indigo> I haven't taken more than 1-2 days off since COVID hit
[01:35:47] <manicennui> We can only carry over a week, and I need the time to decompress.
[01:36:46] <manicennui> I took a week off around the 4th too.
[01:36:54] <manicennui> I really need 2-3 weeks in a row.
[01:37:59] <manicennui> I don't know if I can go long enough without a larger chunk of time off to accrue enough PTO for that.
[01:39:44] <indigo> Yeah I feel you
[01:40:04] <indigo> Three days off in a row for me is when I start feeling normal again
[01:40:46] <manicennui> Next year I will receive 5 more days of PTO (26 days total).
[01:40:54] <manicennui> Yet another thing making it harder to leave.
[01:42:00] <manicennui> Then in 2 years I will receive another sabbatical (additional 28 consecutive days off).
[01:42:13] <indigo> Niiice
[01:42:24] <indigo> I only get 15 PTO per year
[01:42:26] <manicennui> I just wish I didn't have to work with Ruby and Go.
[01:42:32] <manicennui> I started with 15.
[01:42:37] <manicennui> We get 21 after 3 years.
[01:42:48] <manicennui> First sabbatical after 4.
[01:44:10] <indigo> We get 20 after 3 years, heh
[01:44:32] <manicennui> When I was looking for this job, I skipped places that only offered two weeks.
[01:44:39] <manicennui> I had 28 days at the last place.
[01:44:45] <manicennui> Not going back to 10.
[01:45:01] <manicennui> Got 15 at this place, and we have summer hours.
[01:45:15] <manicennui> Which is basically ~3 hours off every Friday from Memorial Day to Labor Day.
[01:45:27] <indigo> Oh wow! That's really good
[01:45:44] <manicennui> And they have randomly given us an extra Friday for hitting some goal.
[01:46:01] <indigo> I remember Basecamp did something similar... every Friday off for summer
[01:46:32] <manicennui> I often have meetings all day Friday now and do no actual work.
[01:46:45] <indigo> Ah fun. Wednesday is my meeting day
[01:46:46] <manicennui> Meetings, lunch, another meeting, done for the day.
[01:47:00] <klardotsh> I'm *stoked* for my new gig coming up... 4 day workweeks as a company-wide policy
[01:47:16] <manicennui> Almost every day is my meeting day, but having fewer hours on Friday means I don't even have the hour or two for actual work.
[01:47:16] <klardotsh> it'll probably spoil me into never being able to consider 40h+ again, but whatever, that's a good change
[01:47:31] <manicennui> klardotsh: 8 hour days?
[01:47:43] <klardotsh> yep
[01:47:47] <manicennui> Very cool.
[01:48:02] <manicennui> I did 4 10-hour days at a warehouse job long ago.
[01:48:08] <indigo> klardotsh: But don't you want to work 80 hours a week for the mission?
[01:48:14] <manicennui> Which was nice because it was physically draining, so I had more time to rest back up.
[01:48:26] <indigo> If you aren't dying, you aren't trying.
[01:48:31] <manicennui> For a PASSION PROJECT!
[01:48:36] <klardotsh> I wasn't looking to leave my current gig but knew I wanted to downshift in the next few years. ended up getting offered 32h weeks for a 20% payraise from my current 40h salary. biggest nobrainer ever.
[01:48:58] <klardotsh> indigo: lollllll after enough years in the startup space all I can do is cry at that, not laugh
[01:49:00] <indigo> Right, you need to have a passion project and also some side projects too

[01:49:05] <buttsbot> How dare he not be available outside work hours?! : ChoosingBeggars
[01:49:12] <indigo> You should do your side projects on top of your 80hrs/wk
[01:49:19] <indigo> klardotsh: Yes... I cry a little too
[01:49:41] <manicennui> "Regardless of deadlines or passion projects (?!?), his workday was determined not by his work, but by his hours."
[01:50:33] <manicennui> I'd probably be willing to work hard for a couple years for guaranteed rewards.
[01:50:55] <manicennui> But I'm not going to work hard in the hopes that the company does well, and that investors don't fuck people with options over.
[01:51:49] <manicennui> Pay me $500k per year base salary and I'll do 60 hours for you.

[02:07:06] <manicennui> He is incredible.

[16:53:22] <Brekkjern> Heh
[16:53:47] <prussian> instead I had a class on relational databases that made us use Oracle 12c instead.
[16:53:59] <prussian> and jesus. sqlplus driver is awful.
[16:54:23] <Brekkjern> I did chose the course myself though. Functional programming sounded like it could be interesting from an academic PoV
[16:55:08] <prussian> well I just finished learn you a haskell for great good, mainly becuase I noticed all my c++ and rust code was looking to procedural, so I needed to feel the functional powers again. good book.

[18:10:28] <cb> tbh as an intermediate C programmer if NULL wasn't defined i'd do a double take
[18:10:38] <cb> i assume the compiler just defines it to (void*)0 for me
[18:10:52] <cb> (or whaytever reps a null ptr)
[18:11:07] <gwozniak> It does, but you have to include the correct header file for it to be defined
[18:13:33] <cb> gotta love C
[18:14:03] <gwozniak> The reason for pretty much all of this is backwards compatibility
[18:14:15] <riv> as much as i love C i have kinda realized that yes we should actually stop using it (and use something better instead)
[18:14:46] <gwozniak> Say what you will about C++, it is working to shed the old stuff, which is working to its benefit
[18:15:32] <gwozniak> Our customers have code that is 20+ years old in some cases and they do NOT want to see it break on a compiler or library update, so you accumulate an awful lot of cruft
[18:17:12] <companion_cube> is it shedding the old stuff?
[18:17:16] <companion_cube> or just pushing it into a corner?

[19:36:50] <prussian> idk
[19:36:55] <prussian> why not.
[19:37:19] <Xe> goodger: also half of it is that it is legitimately hard to make private apps on an iPhone, so the easier route is to literally host a whole ass web server and write the "app" in javascript rather than pay apple $100 a month so you can run your code on your phone
[19:37:30] <prussian> also that lol
[19:37:59] <prussian> I remember when someone using an iphone complained things didn't work because safari didn't have canvas blobbing.

[21:59:27] <manicennui> I meant the space debris removal company.
[21:59:34] <prussian> ok cool. my work network basically uses every single private use IPv4 subnet so I've had things like even docker mess my connection up (at work)

[22:00:21] <Xe> however you can turn off ipv4 entirely with a policy json flag
[22:00:45] <manicennui> This just sounds improbable: "Once the debris is in a low enough orbit, upper atmospheric drag will cause the debris to naturally decay in altitude until it burns up during atmospheric reentry. Critically, the Droid would undock with the debris after dragging it to a low orbit, then orbit-raise, and go on to perform other missions."

[23:06:56] <indigo> Also some folks that have to be spoon-fed what they need to do
[23:07:45] <manicennui> Yeah, I find that the higher up the management chain you go, below the exec level, the more questionable the value of the manager becomes.
[23:08:16] <manicennui> And we have a lot of leads and low level managers who basically do the day-to-day management of the team, and nearly all of our direction comes from business.
[23:08:46] <manicennui> So we have a bunch of SE managers who have very little impact on any real work.
[23:09:13] <manicennui> But there are also a lot of business people who seem to think that we'll magically solve a really hard problem in less time if we just meet about it enough.
[23:09:46] <manicennui> I have a lot of meetings with various parts of the business/product team that are just the same conversation over and over.
[23:11:08] <klardotsh> companies are allergic to asynchronous, written processes, so you end up needing those 9001 meetings per minute to ensure knowledge transfer. it's a plague that seems to start right around the 30-50 employee mark at every company I've ever been at (sometimes as early as 20)
[23:11:53] <manicennui> Most people are really bad at remembering things that were said in meetings.
[23:12:06] <manicennui> Which is a big source of having the same conversations repeatedly.
[23:12:35] <klardotsh> yep. everyone ends up with their own slightly different copies of meeting notes anyway, which always begs the question: why didn't we design this thing in a wiki anyway? (or something like a wiki, whatever)
[23:12:42] <manicennui> Writing documentation seems to have a minimal impact on this.
[23:13:12] <manicennui> There is the problem of finding things when you need them, and then you have many people who see just asking someone else as quicker.
[23:13:28] <manicennui> And a company culture that encourages it.
[23:13:34] <indigo> manicennui: Funny enough, my team has the opposite issue... apparently engineers are supposed to be involved in generating product ideas
[23:13:52] <manicennui> I really think the main reason why our execs want us back in the office is to make our interrupt driven culture easier.
[23:14:03] <indigo> So engineers are product, qa, devops, and of course, swe
[23:14:13] <manicennui> indigo: I'd like to be at that point, but we have multiple years of work that is already known.
[23:14:35] <manicennui> And new things come up daily.
[23:14:50] <manicennui> There is very little time to figure out how to improve things from a product standpoint.
[23:15:06] <klardotsh> manicennui: yeah, agreed (re: return to interrupt culture)
[23:15:17] <manicennui> A lot of the meetings I have are about things they might want to do in the next few months.
[23:15:30] <manicennui> Which is fine other than the fact that there are so many of them.
[23:15:42] <manicennui> And many of them go nowhere or change significantly.
[23:16:16] <manicennui> So I end up protecting my team from a ton of useless meetings, but they tend to decide that they want to do them suddenly, and then my team knows little or nothing about them.
[23:16:36] <manicennui> So my options are waste more people's time with all of these meetings, or have the team less prepared when we start them.
[23:16:39] <prussian> just be a renegade like me and ignore all of the rules, and other things.
[23:17:18] <manicennui> I've gotten them to ignore certain things that are in direct conflict with the way they want to work, which is frequently changing priorities.
[23:17:29] <manicennui> So we basically do kanban, etc.
[23:19:12] <manicennui> I saw another team celebrating today that their burndown looked really good.
[23:19:21] <manicennui> Ours is terrible because we add stories all the time.
[23:19:39] <manicennui> We have two week sprints but are basically changing things all the time.
[23:20:59] <manicennui> I think our problem ultimately is that the software is a large system that was never well designed and every change has been made in the most expedient way possible for over a decade.
[23:21:03] <manicennui> So literally nothing is easy.
[23:21:26] <manicennui> And Rails developers have this obsession with having config in YAML which requires a release to change.
[23:22:57] <mouseghost> is there grindr but like, not for sex?
[23:23:10] <cb> just two dudes wanting to cuddle?
[23:23:12] <manicennui> What else is there?
[23:23:19] <cb> hold hands, of course
[23:23:27] <manicennui> If you mean for relationships, then yes.
[23:23:56] <mouseghost> cb, yes pls give me that
[23:26:03] <cb> mouseghost: from a friend, he says scruff is better if you jsut wanna hang out
[23:26:09] <mouseghost> scruff?
[23:26:10] <mouseghost> o;
[23:26:13] <mouseghost> i wonder if its popular here
[23:26:14] <mouseghost> thanks
[23:27:31] <cb> i have no idea because as a straight guy i just thought grindr was used for pure location based sex
[23:27:36] <cb> but i could be really wrong!
[23:49:02] <mouseghost> no no, i think it really is all about sex
[23:49:14] <mouseghost> even when it isnt
[23:49:28] <mouseghost> unless idk
