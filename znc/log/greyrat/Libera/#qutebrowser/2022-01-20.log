[00:19:32] <sudoforge> amcorrigal: https://github.com/sudoforge/dotfiles/blob/trunk/zsh/.zshrc#L1-L10
[00:20:28] <sudoforge> you may also benefit from one or more of these plugins: https://github.com/sudoforge/dotfiles/blob/trunk/tmux/.tmux.conf#L28-L35
[00:23:09] <amcorrigal> Ha, thanks! Have very primitive timux config right now
[00:26:28] <amcorrigal> Actually, I'm just trying to set up qute-pass for QB, where do I put the userscript? In ~/.config/qutebrowser/greasemonkey ??
[00:29:11] <The-Compiler> amcorrigal: anywhere, you can pass the full path of it to :spawn -u. Note that qutebrowser userscripts are unrelated to greasemonkey userscripts.
[00:31:07] <sudoforge> amcorrigal: i put mine under ~/.config/qutebrowser/usercripts
[00:31:35] <sudoforge> but that's for custom ones. my distribution packages the contrib userscripts that are in the repo and puts them in /usr/share/qutebrowser/userscripts
[00:32:00] <sudoforge> (so qute-pass is already available)
[00:32:42] <sudoforge> The-Compiler: did you ever give some thought to how we want to support kerberos? i'd be happy to work on a patch
[00:32:57] <sudoforge> i'm just now revisiting this and forget exactly what we settled on / if we did
[00:33:01] <amcorrigal> I thought as much, I don't have any customisation. So I'm getting exit code 1 for another reason then
[00:33:02] <The-Compiler> sudoforge: you'd need to patch QtWebEngine, not qutebrowser, most likely
[00:33:23] <sudoforge> qtwebengine supports kerberos; but we need to be able to configure it via qb
[00:33:32] <sudoforge> that's the disconnect
[00:33:36] <The-Compiler> sudoforge: IIRC it has support but it's disabled at built time by default on Linux, apparently because nobody really tested it
[00:33:57] <The-Compiler> sudoforge: what's there to configure? I don't think QtWebEngine has any API for it.
[00:34:18] <amcorrigal> "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tldextract'"
[00:34:33] <amcorrigal> needs a python module installed?
[00:34:36] <sudoforge> amcorrigal: you need to install that, yes
[00:34:38] <The-Compiler> amcorrigal: indeed
[00:35:31] <sudoforge> The-Compiler: iirc we need to be able to set AuthServerWhitelist and one or more other policies
[00:36:56] <The-Compiler> sudoforge: I know nothing about Kerberos. If that's the case, and we can't already get that information to Chromium via command line flags or environment variables yet, it would still first need a change in QtWebEngine.
[00:37:28] <amcorrigal> all working, thanks guys
[00:37:35] <sudoforge> The-Compiler: i'll give it a look tonight
[00:38:18] <sudoforge> amcorrigal: i'd recommend creating a custom package for your distribution that installs the deps you need for any usersripts you use
[00:41:02] <amcorrigal> sudoforge: Can recommend a site describing how to do this? Only just starting out with this

[01:13:13] <marcello42> hey folks, I have a problem w/ qutebrowser running on void linux. Installed all pretty beautiful. But the tabs are freezing after a couple of minutes.. Scrolling works; you can even bring up the options menu ":" .. but even a search does not have any effect at all. I removed already the qtsettings in the .config as well as removed all flags gpu related and also I removed the x86 intel driver,
[01:13:14] <marcello42> as suggest in the forum, chrome on the other hand does not have any issues so I am not sure if the webengine can be the problem since it is the same as in chrome, isn't it?
[01:17:16] <sudoforge> amcorrigal: depends on the distribution you're using.
[01:20:47] <amcorrigal> sudoforge: Arch. I now have a separate script to install extra python packages required for various things, now including this tldextract, but don't think that is what you mean
[01:21:43] <sudoforge> amcorrigal: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PKGBUILD
[01:21:57] <sudoforge> amcorrigal: you can look at some of the AUR packages i maintain for inspiration: https://github.com/sudoforge/pkgbuilds
[01:23:30] <The-Compiler> marcello42: musl?
[01:24:13] <amcorrigal> sudoforge: Thanks for that! New to me. Will spend a bit of time investigating.
[01:24:55] <marcello42> yes
[01:24:56] <sudoforge> amcorrigal: sure thing; feel free to join #archlinux, #archlinux-offtopic, #archlinux-aur
[01:25:05] <marcello42> @ The-Compiler 
[01:26:03] <The-Compiler> marcello42: probably an issue with their musl patches or musl in general then
[01:26:18] <marcello42> man :D
[01:26:20] <The-Compiler> marcello42: you could try KDE Falkon (another browser using QtWebEngine), I bet you'll see the same
[01:26:23] <marcello42> ok chroot then
[01:26:42] <marcello42> I see
[01:27:12] <marcello42> I head up to the void channel and check wether or not other are also encountering this issue
[01:27:33] <marcello42> thanks
[01:27:48] <marcello42> should I succeed at some point I let ya know
