[14:56:33] <no_gravity> I often wish there was something like regex that would match the case of the regex. So "hello wORLd".match(/World/i) would result in 'World' rather than 'wORLd'.
[15:27:11] <purplex> you can convert it after match
[15:29:09] <no_gravity> Yes, but that is a bunch of additional code.
[15:30:11] <purplex> just one line, no? :p
[15:30:32] <no_gravity> Consider this: brand = data.match(/(BMW|Daimler|Porsche)/i)
[15:30:36] <no_gravity> That is not just one line.
[15:31:56] <purplex> yea i mean after regex, or you can wait until that feature is added
[15:34:34] <purplex> regex won't be magic anyway, it will also use some code to convert that if it ever did but your code will likely be more faster
[15:35:13] <no_gravity> Consider this: brand = data.match(/(?:I bought )?a (?:new|old)?(BMW|Daimler|Porsche) for [0-9] Dollar/i)
[15:35:18] <no_gravity> The match nr 1 is the brand. Nice. But the case is usually wrong. Not so nice.
[15:37:29] <purplex> well thats how it has always worked, its for matching text in data not converting case back to match your search text
[15:37:46] <no_gravity> Ye
[15:37:47] <no_gravity> Yes
[15:37:53] <no_gravity> I often have regular expressions like these. Often the user interface allows the user to create their own.
[15:37:58] <no_gravity> All great. Except users are often dissatisfied that they cannot force the case of the matches.
[15:38:27] <no_gravity> So I *might* write my own regex dialect that supports it.
[15:39:59] <karhunkynsi> Regex is "just" the search pattern though.
[15:40:21] <purplex> which code are you using to convert it back to your case?
[15:41:56] <purplex> i was referring to that code when i said one line, but it may be more than a line though depending on how its done and 'language'

[15:43:24] <no_gravity> karhunkynsi: Well, the engine knows which part of the regex caused the match. So it could say "If that part is just regular chars, I use the case of those chars".
[15:44:33] <purplex> actually i think its not really possible, its usually a pattern not text match
[15:45:07] <purplex> a* would match aaaa, but what if you wanted aAaAaAa?
[15:45:50] <purplex> thus, your example is very limited use case
[15:46:08] <no_gravity> limited but very popular here.
