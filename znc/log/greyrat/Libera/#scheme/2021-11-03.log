[20:11:24] <amazigh> I am reading through https://lobste.rs/s/ilsvqt/rational_design_process_how_why_fake_it
[20:11:39] <amazigh> They have an interesting take on documentating interfaces:
[20:12:48] <amazigh> The documentation should be strictly enough (only what matters and not more) for the user of the interface, and that documentation should be enough for the implementer of the interface.
[20:13:47] <amazigh> That is interesting to me because, I keep thinking as part of the SRFI process, it is very difficult for *me* to balance the need of the implementer, and the need of the user.
[20:14:32] <amazigh> I do not have a concrete example, tho.
[20:16:44] <amazigh> pp 4, first column, 2 paragraph: "An interface specification for a module contains just enough for the programmer of another module to use its facilities, and no more. The same information is needed by the implementor [and no more]"
[20:17:10] <amazigh> I added "no more" to the last sentence.

[20:59:29] <Zipheir> Slogan: "The interface specification is the implementation specification."
[20:59:58] <Zipheir> Or, "There is no implementation specification."
[21:05:45] <Zipheir> Interestingly, the authors don't define "rational design".
[21:17:21] <edgar-rft> rational is when you divide one integer by another :-)
[21:22:37] <Zipheir> Then I guess "rational design" is also "fractional design", i.e. only partially complete...
[21:23:15] <mdhughes> I think it's meant to be describing waterfall, or whatever government projects in Ada used in the '70s.
[21:23:54] <mdhughes> So piles of paper describing every operation in English and math, and then some peon "coder" has to go write it.
[21:24:47] <mdhughes> One of my CS profs tried to get us to do that for our project, and it was just easier to generate some comment blocks and fill in bullshit after I had working code.
[21:25:10] <Zipheir> There's a hint of that in the paper that amazigh linked.  "Because of the preparatory work, [actually writing the program] goes quickly and smoothly."  Sure...
[21:27:28] <gwatt> If you're willing and able to specify exactly how everything should work, then I would believe it.
[21:28:04] <Zipheir> Yes.
[21:28:39] <Zipheir> Unfortunately, the paper in question is all about specification practices and doesn't suggest a way to generate programs from that.

[21:29:04] <edgar-rft> I once tried to implement my penis into a vagina but I didn't know the implementation details so I gave up after a while :-)
[21:29:07] <mdhughes> I don't believe it's possible to specify a program over, say, 10 lines and have it be correct.
[21:29:08] <gwatt> On the Apollo missions, NASA supposedly had 5 flight computers. 1 primary, 3 duplicate backups, and the fifth computer designed (hardware too) by an entirely different team using the same specification
[21:30:01] <Zipheir> I recommend "Calculating Correct Compilers" and its successors by Graham Hutton as an example of very powerful specifications that *do* generate executable programs.
[21:30:42] <Zipheir> This is also the dream of logic programming.
[21:31:35] <Zipheir> gwatt: That's a ton of redundancy!
[21:31:47] <edgar-rft> gwatt: did they have an interface for alien functions?
[21:33:29] <gwatt> edgar-rft: unknown. At least by me.

[22:18:58] <amazigh> The paper argues they should make it appear like a waterfall after the fact, but documentation effort is incremental.
[22:20:06] <amazigh> The phrase "Because of the preparatory work..." is misleadiing the paper given the conclusion, that states this is a machination waterfall.
[22:20:24] <Zipheir> amazigh: The analogy with proofs is appropriate.  https://abstrusegoose.com/287
[22:22:17] <amazigh> yes I believe the analogy with proof is appropriate; it is the same with any creative work, the road toward the finished product is an adventure, even the destination is unkown to most "stakeholders".
[22:22:37] <amazigh> the author argue according to their xp, having a great documentation is under appreciated.
[22:23:40] <amazigh> but they do take into account things like: we already discussed that matter, here is the design decision, then it did not work, here the current design. Their fake waterfall documentation will only document the current design.
[22:24:19] <amazigh> they do NOT RECORD the pass of time and changes of design, unlike SRFI

[22:26:28] <amazigh> They also provide at least two canvas, kind of skeleton for the documents that should be produced and part of the project.
[22:27:12] <amazigh> Also, according to them, code should not have docstring, in particular code inline doc should not repeat what is documentation, otherwise it is costly or one of them is out-of-sync.
[22:27:15] <Zipheir> I'm not sure the phrase "waterfall documentation" makes sense to me.
[22:27:15] *** Joins: hexteex (~hexteex@gateway/tor-sasl/hexteex)
[22:27:40] <amazigh> waterfall documentation means the documentation you should produce in waterfall process.
[22:28:03] <Zipheir> Surelyâ„¢ the system should be presented as a complete (in time) entity, not a as a bunch of stages?
[22:28:09] <amazigh> the product of the first step of a waterfall.
[22:28:37] <amazigh> they glimpse over incremental thing, but do not mention it explicitly.
[22:28:59] <amazigh> my understanding is they recommend an incremental approach.
[22:29:09] <amazigh> in today "english"
[22:29:29] <Zipheir> Yes, that's my understanding from skimming the paper.
[22:30:04] <amazigh> In fact, SRFI and RnRS looks much like what the paper describes
[22:30:29] <Zipheir> It depends on the SRFI, but yes.
[22:31:12] <amazigh> The document skeletons they recommend are different. In the paper, it is interesting to go through the various bullet points.
[22:33:12] <Zipheir> I think it's also worth noting that the specification of functional-flavored libraries might be very different than those for state-based programs/systems.
[22:34:10] *** Joins: ec (~ec@gateway/tor-sasl/ec)
[22:34:15] <Zipheir> With a library function, it might be sufficient documentation to give a type and a brief semantics.
[22:34:38] <Zipheir> (Or just a type, if you have a sufficiently expressive type system.)
[22:35:31] <Zipheir> Maybe that's just another flavor of what the IEEE folks were describing, though.
[22:36:27] <amazigh> they mention the documentation that is part of the project should not have naratives, it should look like a reference manual (my understanding is that it should be bullet points, avoiding or clear of repetitions)
[22:36:49] <amazigh> it is not story telling or a guide.
[22:37:20] <Zipheir> Nor a tutorial.
