[00:23:42] <sarnold> PUPPPY
[00:23:50] <sarnold> has that baloon died yet?
[00:24:01] <ThePendulum> yes but that was not the puppy's fault
[00:24:19] <ThePendulum> I also massacred two balloons the other night after they started popping randomly and giving me a heart attack

[00:26:33] <ThePendulum> I was absolutely hammered, then the fire alarm battery warning started going off.
[00:27:19] <ThePendulum> after risking my life getting on a step daddy to replace it I sat down and a fucking alarm clock went off
[00:27:22] <ThePendulum> step ladder*
[00:30:18] <sarnold> man those fire alarm battery warnings are the worst
[00:31:18] <ThePendulum> stood there like an idiot waiting for the next beep trying to locate it

[00:36:35] <xMopx> lol ill usually rotate my batteries until it stops 
[00:36:59] <xMopx> put a new battery in a random detector, leave battery on counter. If the beep stopped, throw away the battery because its dead
[00:37:03] <ThePendulum> like out them in the wrong way around?
[00:37:08] <xMopx> if it continues, repeat on a different detector 
[00:37:09] <ThePendulum> oh lol
[00:41:02] <ThePendulum> was it ever not dead?
[00:41:48] <xMopx> well thats the point, if it's not dead the battery ends up in another detector 
[00:42:10] <xMopx> it's an algorithm
[00:42:56] <ThePendulum> so you take a mostly full battery out of another detector and put an almost certainly empty battery in?
[00:45:00] <xMopx> no

[01:11:08] <skye0> might consider getting a driving test but i've mainly put it off because i don't want to drive my parents around i admit
[01:12:13] <skye0> figuring out how UK units work is something though
[01:13:24] <ThePendulum> something like 5 stones in a mile
[01:13:46] <skye0> yards is like 9/10 of a meter
[01:13:58] <skye0> stones are body weight measurements that seem to be unique to the UK
[01:14:26] <skye0> thing is my spatial sense of direction is kind of shit anyway, IDK how far is 20 meters let alone 2 sometimes
[01:14:50] <skye0> need it because i have so much shit to carry around (including my hoarding setup) and for ID verification purposes (I don't have enough proofs of ID)
[01:15:39] <skye0> plus forza horizon 5 made me want to drive again in a way
[01:16:49] <ThePendulum> remove all the passenger seatbelts from your car
[01:21:23] <skye0> or i might have to buy a van instead, but idk where to park it
[01:21:34] <skye0> don't need a van license under a certain weight
[01:22:18] <skye0> was gonna say something but forgot when i played
[01:25:57] <skye0> ah, yeah. i got used to the metric system thanks to games funnily enough. even games made in the USA and set in the USA often use metric only
[01:29:01] <xMopx> metric is an awful system 
[01:29:12] <xMopx> what's 1/3rd of a meter? 33.33333333333333cm? useless
[01:29:19] <xMopx> 1/3rd of a yard? 1 foot or 12 inches
[01:29:38] <ThePendulum> I've heard that used unironically
[01:29:38] <Frogging101> yes, because being able to divide things into thirds is more useful than quarters, halves, or tenths
[01:29:58] <xMopx> 1/4 of a yard is 9 inches
[01:30:02] <xMopx> ez
[01:30:43] <xMopx> i can understand how people latch on since they're used to base 10 mathematics but this is the real world
[01:32:31] <ThePendulum> I mean you can still say 1/3rd of a meter
[01:33:15] <xMopx> how do i punch that into a calculator?

[01:34:28] <ThePendulum> how do you punch 5 4/5th inches into a calculator?
[01:34:29] <xMopx> so... the same way imperial works
[01:35:00] <xMopx> 5 and 4/5ths inches isnt an infinitely repeating decimal like 1/3rd of a meter
[01:35:09] <xMopx> 5.8
[01:35:10] <xMopx> ez
[01:35:17] <ThePendulum> ok, 1/3rds of an inch then
[01:35:29] <xMopx> we have a unit specifically for that :)

[21:34:20] <evilgohan2> $20000? $200000? Pfft.
[21:34:25] <evilgohan2> Cost of doing business.
[21:34:33] <imMute> oh for sure.  I'm just saying it's meaningless to want new laws when the existing laws cover what you want but arent' being enforced
[21:34:41] <evilgohan2> Indeed
[21:34:45] <NeoThermic> that's a small thing the GDPR got right
[21:35:00] <evilgohan2> GDPR got a lot right.
[21:35:10] <evilgohan2> Compliance with GDPR on the part of companies gets a lot wrong.

[21:51:53] <skye0> imMute the main political parties would rather die than make capitalism fall
[21:52:00] <skye0> GDPR is great
[21:52:03] <imMute> skye0: mhmm
[21:52:12] <skye0> i just want to complain about work
[21:52:22] <unfinity> ・゜゜・。。・ ​ ゜゜\​_0< QUAC​K!
[21:52:23] <skye0> too soon to quit, got nowhere to go otherwise, could experience the same bullshit again IMO
[21:52:23] <KevinCarbonara> the only problem with GDPR is that a lot of companies just ignore it entirely
[21:52:25] <KevinCarbonara> ,bef
[21:52:25] <unfinity> KevinCarbonara you befriended a duck in 2.532 seconds! You have made friends with 65 ducks in #datahoarder.
[21:52:40] <KevinCarbonara> we need the US to pass some GDPR-like law so that it can actually get enforced
[21:52:57] <skye0> yup, canada too (since i plan to move there in the very long term)
[21:53:18] <imMute> KevinCarbonara: yeah that would be awesome.  but see skye0's comment about the current political parties
[21:54:23] <KevinCarbonara> we have control over that, though
[21:55:00] <KevinCarbonara> it's clear which party is the biggest problem. So if we eliminate Republicans we can start using Democratic elections to separate progressives from the Republicans that run as a Democrat
[21:55:12] <skye0> interesting
[21:55:32] <skye0> let's hope things improve soon. don't want to think about politics too much though yet (although talk about ukraine is sort of free reign for me) when work is enough to piss me off
[21:56:04] <imMute> skye0: :)
[21:56:53] <skye0> all i get excited about from work is pay or when i don't have to fucking work, like yesterday, because of COVID (unfortunately i tested negative and have to work)
[21:57:42] <skye0> running out of shit to enjoy. livestreamers i want to watch on twitch all want to just stream elden ring (which i'm not really interested in)
[21:57:42] <imMute> same.  was super excited about the work at my last job.  then they kicked 100 people out because they got scared of COVID.  now I just work for the paycheck
[21:57:53] *** Quits: easyriders (~easyrider@xb9b5df82.cust.hiper.dk) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[21:57:59] <skye0> i work for the paycheck and constantly envy this one woman in this job
[21:58:13] <skye0> and don't like some of the people in my team because i find one or two of them intimidating
[21:58:32] <KevinCarbonara> I don't care for my team either
[21:58:45] <KevinCarbonara> I mostly hate that my job takes me 10+hours a day
[21:59:01] <skye0> i don't have to talk to them much but one of them is my immediate superior (not manager though). i'm lucky they're too sick to work right now
[21:59:33] <KevinCarbonara> All the devs on my team undersold themselves financially
[21:59:42] <skye0> i should be lucky that i only have to work eight hours but i might have to work longer to make up for absences and because there's so much to do
[21:59:43] <KevinCarbonara> So my boss thinks I'm overpaid
[21:59:53] <skye0> plus there's so much fucking turnover with the pharmacy assistants in my job
[22:00:54] <skye0> been thinking of the following: twitch streamer, colleague at either H&M or Vans, programmer, and I don't think they could be the cut for me. I might stay with the NHS but honestly i prefer it just because it fits best with my principles
[22:01:08] <skye0> those other jobs sound more fun to me but have their own serious drawbacks
[22:02:04] <KevinCarbonara> what is your job?
[22:02:12] <skye0> H&M and Vans aren't exactly very progressive (especially with gender, an online-only fashion store does so much better and IDK if i could even work there). i've barely programmed for months and i'd sometimes rather keep to myself even if i made a ton on twitch and it had no association with amazon
[22:02:23] <skye0> pharmacy assistant for my local hospital
[22:02:28] <skye0> quite a big hospital too
[22:02:35] <KevinCarbonara> why don't you want to be a programmer?
[22:02:58] <KevinCarbonara> I advise virtually everyone with the ability to program to learn it, there's not another career I know of that pays as well and is as easy to get into
[22:03:21] <skye0> most of the jobs are in web dev. i'm not really interested in web dev. my skills with Git and even just Python are barely sufficient (if at all) for helping out on commercial grade projects. not much for open source too in the UK
[22:03:56] <skye0> might start picking up rust again if i have enough time on my leave next week. also planning to learn to drive and maybe make a start with medical transitioning too through private healthcare once i've gotten some advice
[22:04:14] <skye0> not sure if i feel ready to learn to drive but i got a lot of shit to move around and NHS jobs want me to have one as proof of ID
[22:05:28] <KevinCarbonara> "web dev" is a pretty large and amorphous category
[22:05:30] <skye0> i don't mind freemium open source software (i've been using one too), but the UK barely has anything for open source - i'd have next to no choice but work in the US for it, and until the US works more like Canada politically and culturally i'd rather just go there only for pleasure, not business
[22:05:45] <KevinCarbonara> I've been "web dev" my whole career, but that's covered everything from front end frameworks to back end microservices
[22:05:50] <skye0> only "front end" and "back end"
[22:06:32] *** Parts: energizer (~energizer@user/energizer) (Leaving)
[22:06:33] <skye0> there's software dev jobs but idk if i'll make the damn cut. my knowledge in a programming language isn't comprehensive enough for anything very serious, and aside from data hoarding, the only other reason i want to program is to make a game or two as passion projects
[22:07:08] <skye0> plus i've chosen to be involved quite strictly with the NHS to lessen my chances of getting involved with pandemic denialists
