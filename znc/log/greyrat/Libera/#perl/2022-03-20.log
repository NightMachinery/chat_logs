[00:18:59] <mongo> Hi.
[00:19:00] <mongo> I am trying to understand this file: https://git.libreoffice.org/core/+/refs/heads/master/autogen.sh
[00:19:00] <mongo> What does 'if 0' on line 26 mean?
[00:19:01] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ autogen.sh - core - Gitiles ]
[00:19:01] <mongo> And why it starts with colon? Don't the shell scripts start with shebang

[00:23:44] <fizzie> I don't know about the colon, but the `if 0` bit looks like it is to make that a shell-Perl polyglot.
[00:24:22] <fizzie> The `if 0` will make Perl skip over the `eval '...'`, but since it's on a separate line, the shell doesn't, and exec's the same file with Perl.

[00:30:51] <xenu> on ancient unixes, before shebang was invented, ":" meant "execute this using /bin/sh"
[00:31:00] <xenu> while "#" meant "execute this using /bin/csh"
[00:31:45] <mongo> Ok. So In Perl, it will not execute the eval line as this is post-condition in Perl. And in shell this will terminate after eval command on 'if 0'. Thus executing the script as Perl script. Thanks.
[00:31:46] <xenu> on modern operating systems scripts are *always* executed using /bin/sh unless there's a shebang
[00:31:56] <xenu> and : is a no-op command

[07:08:50] <dansan> Is there some strange thing I have to do for Perl to believe that it's a valid file handle?
[07:11:43] <dansan> Oh, I guess it's expecting a perl "filehandle" and I'm passing it a standard, unix file number.

[23:31:15] <aindilis> HTML::Parser is messing up on my last token, and somehow prepends it to the front of a join of the accumulated text.  So like if I parse "This is the FRDCSA Project", I get "ProjectThis is the FRDCSA".
[23:31:28] <aindilis> any clues?

[23:36:48] <rewt> it's usually best to understand what's really wrong than to try random things until it seems to "work"... in this case, what is the actual html that's being parsed? (i doubt it's just "This is the FRDCSA Project")
