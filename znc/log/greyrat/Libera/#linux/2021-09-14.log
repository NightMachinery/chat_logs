[01:51:45] <jim> if you have -a lot- of experience in solving problems in a linux distribution of any kind, and you have -a lot- of knowledge of debian specifically, maybe you could handle debian unstable, and maybe you could be of benefit to them, by finding and -fixing- problems, and making bug reports with fixes
[01:51:53] <BCMM> (pedantry warning: it probably gets put in experimental first)
[01:51:58] <djph> it gets proven on sid for a bit, then moves into testing.  Then testing eventually becomes stable
[01:52:20] <BCMM> jim: to be honest, i don't think sid is as bad as you're making it sound
[01:52:21] <doctor_who> No1x3r0: that package sits in unstable (sid) for a period of time pending no bugs of a certain criteria
[01:52:28] <doctor_who> No1x3r0: then it moves over to testing
[01:52:33] <No1x3r0> lol, these windows analogies and I haven't so much as touched a windows system in over a decade

[05:29:59] <katp32> pam log just says "Authentication failure" with no additional information
[05:30:26] <katp32> I've triple checked that the password is correct and the account isn't locked

[05:48:27] <katp32>  /usr/bin/git-shell wasn't in /etc/shells, and for some reason this made ssh not willing to spawn it, which would make sense except that `usermod` and `su` didn't say anything about it :/

[07:18:27] <katp32> ...I wonder if they would cover it if I tried to buy an abacus with $2k worth of gold in it
[07:18:30] <SineDeviance> katp32: you don't need $60k
[07:18:42] <rascul> $59k should do
[07:18:54] <SineDeviance> I spent like $200 on my rackmount server. another $400 or so on the SSDs and spinning drives that went into it
[07:19:01] <katp32> $59k and then use the savings to buy an extra 1/60th of a server rack
[07:19:14] <rascul> save the business money over the long term
[07:19:18] <SineDeviance> It has 12c/24t and 32 GB of RAM, which isn't a ton but it's plenty for my needs
[07:19:18] <katp32> exactly
[07:19:50] <SineDeviance> it's a dell r620 so linux support is a given, although I run hyper-v on it
[07:20:02] <katp32> I'm not actually looking to buy a server rack :P
[07:20:11] <rascul> maybe that's your problem
[07:20:14] <SineDeviance> fine, but I'm just sayin
[07:20:31] <SineDeviance> katp32: in all seriousness - go for dell or lenovo business lines. latitude/thinkpad
[07:20:35] <SineDeviance> they work great with linux
[07:20:44] <SineDeviance> almost all of them are fully supported
[07:20:48] <rascul> i've had generally good results with dell in the past
[07:20:56] <katp32> I've got a thinkpad x395 as my daily driver right now and like, it's ok, but it's not really phenomenal or anything
[07:21:11] <SineDeviance> if you go thinkpad though, stick to the main product lines - T, X, W, P series
[07:21:25] <CoderCop> The Dell XPS laptops also work great with Linux and they usually have the XPS13 available with linux pre-installed. (Sadly, the linux line often lags behind the windows line, so I've had to buy the windows line just to wipe it on arrival.)
[07:21:34] <rascul> are there any thinkpads without the nub though?
[07:21:40] <SineDeviance> some of the newer lines (like my E-series) are not officially supported by lenovo for linux and upstream is still ironing out bugs
[07:21:43] <rascul> wouldn't be worth the money otherwise
[07:21:43] <stevecam> akoana, rascul tried re-installing and reconfigure
[07:21:55] <SineDeviance> on the other hand, I have a 6-core ryzen CPU in my work laptop, so can't complain

[07:22:15] <SineDeviance> rascul: i dunno, maybe the L-series? those are the 'low-end' ones, right?
[07:22:19] <katp32> it can't coreboot, it's got few IO ports, very little RAM, mediocre graphics, and like sure it's a low end model but still, I'm honestly not sure what the appeal is. like, they're good, but not like blow-my-mind good

[07:22:57] <stevecam> no success
[07:23:02] <SineDeviance> katp32: well, that's a ryzen laptop right?
[07:23:06] <rascul> SineDeviance looks like the L series has the nub
[07:23:07] <katp32> yup
[07:23:26] <katp32> I will say that the CPU is everything I could've asked for though, 8 threads is wonderful
[07:23:31] <SineDeviance> yeah, ryzen on laptops (or hell, altogether) is still kinda new, if compatibility is an issue just give it some time
[07:23:43] <katp32> but going back to 6GiB of memory when my last machine had 16GiB was painful :P
[07:23:48] <SineDeviance> my gaming laptop is a legion 5, ryzen 4800H / GTX 1660Ti
[07:24:04] <katp32> eh, I've not had any driver issues, everything's worked pretty smoothly
[07:24:11] <SineDeviance> this thing is nuts, it's seriously on-par with my desktop workstation running a 3700X / RTX 2070 Super
[07:24:20] <SineDeviance> it's just crazy what ryzen has done for mobile
[07:24:34] <katp32> ...except the latest firmware update from ~march 2021, which completely fucked it, but that's fine, I just don't use that firmware until AMD releases a newer version :P
[07:24:43] <SineDeviance> then again it uses a 230W PSU so what would you expect
[07:24:57] <catman> i love my ryzen laptop
[07:25:28] <akoana> stevecam: I guess you could repair it with booting the vm from live media (debian 11) and follow the instructions here: https://forum.level1techs.com/t/reinstall-grub/134056#deb (it's for ubuntu and debian, use /dev/vda instead of /dev/sda)
[07:25:29] <SineDeviance> the drawback (to both ryzen laptops I have) is battery life. intel still has them beat by a LARGE margin there. but price/performance, ryzen is a clear and distant winner

[07:27:47] <SineDeviance> no dedicated graphics on the E15G2 either, but for what I use it for (IT) the AMD APU cores are more than enough
[07:27:51] <catman> SineDeviance do you use ryzenadj?
[07:28:03] <justsomeguy> I've never had a laptop that gets more than 3.5hrs, even on a higher-end 7th gen intel ultrabook with tlp set up.
[07:28:36] <SineDeviance> catman: nah, I use ryzen master on my legion 5 and on my thinkpad I just let the default thinkpad power manager handle it
[07:28:53] <catman> ok
[07:29:52] <SineDeviance> the legion 5 stays plugged in to both power and USB-C dock pretty much 99% of the time, so i want max performance all the time there. the thinkpad sees mixed use
[07:29:55] <SineDeviance> just depends on the day
[07:30:19] <catman> i keep my dell g5 5505 plugged in most of the time too
[07:30:35] <SineDeviance> that is one nice upside BTW, my lenovo USB-C dock gen 2 works completely fine with both laptops. it charges the thinkpad even

[11:51:10] *** Joins: job (~job@wikimedia-commons/pandakekok9)
[11:51:19] <mawk> the chip is a kind of SRAM, but the framwork is made for flash kind of memory wyre
[11:51:23] <mawk> it's similar enough, but not the same
[11:51:32] <wyre> mawk, I see
[11:51:36] <mawk> flash needs to erase pages before writing them over, your SRAM chip doesn't need it
[11:51:54] <mawk> you'd be better off just writing a proper driver from the start using regular SPI, it's not that hard, you have just a few opcodes to send
[11:52:23] <wyre> mawk, sure, but the point is ... how to mix this own made driver with the OS
[11:52:39] <mawk> what do you mean?
[11:52:43] <ayecee> not sure what kind of answer you're hoping for there
[11:52:44] <mawk> a linux driver is in the OS
[11:52:54] <mawk> you can interface with read() and write() syscall
[11:53:05] <wyre> mawk, yes, but how could I see the eeram chip between all storage devices in the system?
[11:53:11] <ayecee> it mixes the same way other drivers do
[11:53:28] <mawk> you mean you want to use it for file storage? then it needs to apear as a block device
[11:53:35] <mawk> so see the block device API of linux kernel
[11:53:35] <ayecee> wyre: you'd write a driver that presents it as a storage device.
[11:53:38] <wyre> mawk, something like that

[11:56:08] <mawk> compared to a SSD or stuff like this yes
[11:56:19] <wyre> well, it's a 64kb chip
[11:56:23] <mawk> yeah
[11:56:24] <wyre> I just want to store a simple text file
[11:56:40] <mawk> so maybe don't write a block driver, just write a normal driver than can store opaque data, and do something else in userland

[11:58:14] <mawk> https://linux-kernel-labs.github.io/refs/heads/master/labs/device_drivers.html
[11:58:14] <ayecee> examples on how to present an arbitrary chip as a file? probably no.

[11:58:33] *** Joins: fdan (~fdan@192.146.154.3)

[11:59:45] <wyre> ayecee, I don't get your point, do you mean permanently?
[11:59:55] <mawk> you could even use fuse if you really wanted to have something that looks like a storage device
[12:00:12] <ayecee> wyre: yes, instead of writing a separate driver for it
[12:00:15] <wyre> mawk, like flash the chip?
[12:00:17] <mawk> it's not like you could get more performance out of a linux driver anyway, and it's more trouble
[12:00:24] <mawk> yes wyre ; that's what the kernel driver would do anyway
[12:00:49] <wyre> oh, anyway I would need to research about how to flash the file
[12:01:02] <wyre> I mean, opcodes allow me to write specific addresses
[12:01:07] <ayecee> just like you're already doing, with spidev
[12:01:11] <wyre> but I guess a file is a lot of bytes
[12:01:22] <wyre> so ... I should flash the binary
[12:01:38] <ayecee> well no, this isn't a flash device.

[12:45:35] <alkisg> xx, more "up to date" usually also means "more issues", which isn't appropriate for beginners. Yeah Ubuntu LTS editions have a good balance of new vs stable, even if that means that some packages may be a couple of years old at some point

[12:47:21] <xx> RayTracer: ubuntu has far too old software for them
[12:47:30] <xx> they need to use the same versions of software as upstream
[12:47:45] <xx> (basically equivalent to windows software autoupdating to latest)
[12:48:16] <xx> alkisg: the "more issues with latest software" is not really relevant, because the software gets updated, often in the same day, when the issues are found
[12:48:44] <RayTracer> xx: with this requirement, you basically separate the OS from the "software"
[12:48:46] <xx> it's more of a problem when the buggy software stays in the repos for years because it can't be updated due to the distro update policy
[12:48:54] <jim> xx, maybe folks would need the latest, maybe not... the thing is, old software can work just fine
[12:48:54] <xx> RayTracer: pretty much, yes
[12:49:04] <Sauvin> xx, which is more important: "easy to use" or "up to date software"?
[12:49:08] <xiaomiao> xx: "easy to use" is subjective
[12:49:20] <xx> Sauvin: both at the same time, equal importance
[12:49:27] <xx> basically a linux equivalent of windows
[12:49:32] <xiaomiao> so any answers to your question will be subjective and might not work for you
[12:49:34] <Sauvin> No such critter.
[12:49:35] <RayTracer> xx: so take the most stable OS, and use some other mechanism for "software" to keep it with upstream
[12:49:41] <alkisg> xx, in Linux, the software is usually packaged. Packages are not provided by upstream, like the usual setup.exe in Windows. Additionally, packages do not include the library dependencies, like in Windows. This is the reason e.g. debian testing has 1000+ bugs, and months are needed to lower them and be able to release something stable

[12:50:27] <xiaomiao> xx: and RHEL5 has been end of life for a loong time
[12:50:37] <jim> xx, whether old software can work for people, depends on how they apply it and what they apply it to
[12:50:49] <xx> so do I interpret it correctly that I should just take any easy to use distro, and then somehow manually keep all the software up to date?

[12:52:23] <gebbione> htpasswd encrypts passwords using either bcrypt, a version of MD5 modified for Apache, SHA1, or the system's crypt() routine.

[14:27:51] <geirha> +r lets you list the content (e.g. with ls), +x lets you access it (e.g. with cd)
[14:28:00] <FuriousGeorge> numactl --physcpubing seems like it should work on a per socket or per chiplet basis, but instead it binds to logical cpus,
[14:28:02] <cousteau> I see
[14:28:06] *** Joins: Umbire (~UmbireThe@user/umbire)
[14:28:24] <doctor_who> cousteau: you pretty much always want +x if you want read and/or write access to the directory
[14:28:32] <cousteau> So with just +r I won't be able to list the content of subfolders, right?
[14:28:58] <geirha> right, nor will you be able to see the content of the files within, you can only list their names
[14:29:06] <FuriousGeorge> if i use --cpubind, it works on a per numa group basis, but only for nodes that have corresponding memory nodes.  i have 4 cpu nodes, and 2 memory nodes.
[14:29:26] <cousteau> doctor_who: does +x grant write access (can create my own stuff in it, delete stuff, etc)?
[14:29:31] <doctor_who> no
[14:29:37] <cousteau> Or do I need both w and x for that?
[14:29:42] <FuriousGeorge> so i cant use --cpubind=1,3 because the 2 memory nodes are 0 and 2
[14:29:50] <doctor_who> it is what allows you to list that directories files/subdirs
[14:30:00] <doctor_who> but that's it
[14:30:01] <cousteau> Excellent, thanks
[14:30:01] <FuriousGeorge> so --cpubind=0,2 is fine
[14:30:12] <xiaomiao> FuriousGeorge: that's mildly unconventional, any reason not all nodes have memory?
[14:30:50] <FuriousGeorge> xiaomiao:  my guess is because that is how the actual circuitry is laid out.  2 chiplets share a memory bus

[16:42:14] <fakuve> Hi guys guys . I'm again with string manipulation in Linux , I was the other day checking `sed` but either I didnt understand well the full concept or I think is not the right tool for this situation , I want to basically recognise certain areas of some linux output commands , such as columns , so I can pipe it in the Standard Output and grab that certain part of the text , say that the output is made of
[16:42:16] <fakuve> `worda wordb wordc` and I want to grab the third column always (wordc) what is the right tool? is that `awk` ?

[18:42:14] <paws_> Hello, this is a bash terminal on MacOS question (not Linux but maybe it doesn't matter), I'm starting a daemon from the terminal, with & at the end to run it on the background. If I run `jobs` after it, it doesn't list anything. It clearly still running because I still see the output of the process on the terminal. Any ideas?
[18:43:10] <paws_> all I've been able to find about this is that if jobs doesn't list it it means it's running on another shell? but this seems not to be the case?
[18:43:27] <esselfe> It shows up in 'jobs' here

[23:54:04] *** Quits: knidos (~knidos@85.99.22.106) (Quit: WeeChat 3.2)
[23:54:14] <LambdaComplex> yeah what ayecee said basically
[23:54:22] <Mathisen> ahh i get it
[23:54:38] *** Quits: oldgalileo (~oldgalile@host-212-18-2-82.customer.m-online.net) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:54:42] <LambdaComplex> it just contains the differences between a new package and an old package
[23:54:44] *** Joins: fedenix (~fedenix@gateway/tor-sasl/fedenix)
[23:54:49] <LambdaComplex> so if you have the old package you can just install the delta
[23:54:52] <LambdaComplex> meaning: smaller download
[23:54:52] <shan> is there a linux mail client that supports writing emails markdown
[23:54:54] *** Joins: oldgalileo (~oldgalile@host-212-18-2-82.customer.m-online.net)
[23:54:56] <shan> *emails with
[23:55:03] <roofy> basically what I said
[23:55:04] <roofy> :v
[23:55:11] <LambdaComplex> isn't the main selling point of markdown the fact that it's literally just plain text? :p
[23:55:13] <guest734> ah, an update
[23:55:14] <roofy> different form of saying it
[23:55:48] <ananke> shan: not sure what the expected outcome is, as most e-mail clients don't bother rendering markdown
[23:55:52] <shan> LambdaComplex: yes, but everyone and their mother sends html emails these days
[23:55:55] *** Quits: haycon (~haycon@84.215.37.126) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[23:55:58] <ananke> shan: do you want the result to be html formatted body?
[23:56:01] <LambdaComplex> shan: isn't it terrible?
[23:56:14] <LambdaComplex> ananke: ooh, pandoc | sendmail??
[23:56:19] *** Quits: fedenix (~fedenix@gateway/tor-sasl/fedenix) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:56:20] <shan> so i was wondering if i could write my email in markdown and have the recipient receive formatted email

[23:56:39] <ananke> shan: formatted in what? HTML presumably?
[23:56:42] <shan> yeah
[23:56:53] <LambdaComplex> ananke: fair
[23:57:01] <ayecee> shan: i don't think there's an existing mail client that does that
[23:57:06] <LambdaComplex> ...does mutt support reading an outgoing email body on stdin?
[23:57:07] <uwharrie> could probably script something up in mutt to provide the markdown as text/plain and render a second MIME section as HTML
[23:57:25] <ananke> shan: never seen such beast
[23:57:31] <shan> uwharrie: emails can have multiple types? :00000000
[23:57:45] <ayecee> yes
[23:57:51] <shan> ayecee + ananke: god damn it, now i'm going to be thinking about writing one myself
[23:57:58] <shan> it would be an excuse to learn about email
[23:58:07] <ayecee> and i'll be thinking about you thinking about writing one!
[23:58:08] <uwharrie> yes, a lot of clients include the plain text version of those HTML formatted emails
[23:58:20] *** Joins: fedenix (~fedenix@gateway/tor-sasl/fedenix)
[23:58:34] <ayecee> good old mime multipart message
[23:58:40] <shan> uwharrie: that's super cool :0
[23:58:54] <ayecee> i wonder if there's a mimetype for markdown
[23:59:28] *** Joins: humky (~humky@user/humky)
[23:59:32] <ananke> shan: not sure why you think I suggested writing your own
[23:59:32] <shan> In March 2016, text/markdown was registered as RFC7763 at IETF.
[23:59:43] <LambdaComplex> side note, building haproxy RPMs is surprisingly painless

[23:59:49] *** martums1 is now known as martums
[23:59:50] <ayecee> i don't wonder any more :)
[23:59:51] <LambdaComplex> at least as painless as building RPMs can be
