[04:58:19] <onosendi> wroathe: correct. The problem is, the server has `limit = req.query.limit || 100`, and there's only one endpoint. So I can't even hit the server for a total length :/
[04:59:26] <wroathe> onosendi: The API will need to be modified to add the total length of items in the response body or as a response header, or you could use something like hateos to give you a link to the next page
[04:59:42] <wroathe> onosendi: I.e. you can't do this on the client side. The server side needs to get smarter.

[08:40:01] <Intelo> ashnur how to get the desired output at bottom?
[08:41:08] <ashnur> like text? with -> arrows?
[08:41:39] <Intelo> yes
[08:41:54] <ashnur> is that the order they were called or the order they are nested?
[08:41:58] <Intelo> any kind but the point is to trace function calls and deal with imports
[08:42:20] <Intelo> the order can be any

[08:42:58] <ashnur> you can do something like https://www.npmjs.com/package/falafel
[08:43:19] <ashnur> but if you want call trace, you kinda need to run the code I think :-S
[08:47:33] <Intelo> ashnur hm. ok. so A) how to trace calls by running code? What if a function never gets hit in run?  b) I think it still possible without running because if javascript engine can trace the calls and execute it. so can I . I just don't know how
[08:48:50] *** Joins: ryzenda (~ryzenda@pool-74-109-246-70.pitbpa.fios.verizon.net)
[08:51:00] <Intelo> ashnur what do you think
[08:52:08] <ashnur> Taking a stack trace and listing it differently is easy
[08:52:16] <ashnur> but it might not have all the information

[08:52:37] <ashnur> so I guess the real issue for me is that I am not quite sure what the -> represent. possibility of call, or actual call?
[08:53:18] <ashnur> if you say, deal with imports, that sounds like dependency management + dead call elimination
[08:53:35] <ashnur> sorry, dead code* elimination
[08:53:44] <ashnur> for something that specific I would look into existing solutions
[08:55:34] *** Joins: silly (~silly@user/silly)
[08:56:44] <ashnur> ultimately it ends up just multiple traverses, building an AST and then displaying the relevant stuff
[08:57:32] <Intelo> ashnur tracing code. not actual runtime calls
[08:57:53] <ashnur> the reason I said you might need to run it because I can do stuff like https://www.mikedoesweb.com/2020/dynamic-method-names-on-javascript-es6-classes/
[08:58:02] <Intelo> ashnur like this https://www.sourcetrail.com/#intro
[08:59:34] <ashnur> cute :)
[08:59:45] <ashnur> will have to try it

[09:13:12] <Intelo> ashnur yes I have seen such kind but it only shows AST kind of stuff on current file. doesn't traces multiple files and imports
[09:13:25] <Intelo> ashnur if you try it out, let me know if it worked
[09:14:21] <ashnur> Intelo, ok, so see, that is important because if you don't care about a lot of things, I think falafel should just work fine with a bit of tinkering

[13:20:45] <OnkelTem> Cork: I see. Gotta check out what 501 is used for
[13:20:47] <Cork> daoudr: basically, if an irc channel isn't explicitly multi language or a specific language it is uslally english only
[13:21:16] <Cork> OnkelTem: something like PATCH for a resource that only supports post or get for example
[13:21:21] <daoudr> I know an old dude who wish to learn how to code but german is his second language. so I was wondering if this room would encourage him to give it a try
[13:22:11] <OnkelTem> daoudr: we understand any dialects here!
[13:22:16] <OnkelTem> haha
[13:22:34] <OnkelTem> or what would one expect from an international irc channel
[13:22:54] <Cork> daoudr: if ppl started talking all different languages it quickly becomes a mess where most can't follow the conversations
[13:23:16] <Cork> that is why the implisit rule i meantioned before is commonly applied
[13:23:59] <Cork> if the channel is inactive it is usually not enforsed, but if it is active and it starts to be highly mixed it is often stopped one way or another
[13:25:01] <daoudr> this is understandable
[13:25:11] <OnkelTem> Cork: I see, thanks.

[16:53:16] <stenno> ...
[16:53:39] <iridium__> i'm making a very simple web application using vanilla JavaScript. i send prepared HTML (like CGI) whenever there is a request. i have to display some text items whose names should be changeable through an edit button. which tag should i be using to display the text of the item?
[16:53:42] <stenno> a 'documentation' is not the same as 'javascript interview questions'
[16:53:44] <iridium__> i'm currently using an `<input readonly="true">` and when the user clicks the button to edit, it becomes `<input readonly="false">` through an event handler on the button.

[18:49:42] <austincheney> for some reason Node refuses to add certificate support, maybe because its a huge pain the ass and differs wildly cross-os, even though all the crypto comes from the same embedded instance of openssl

[19:06:23] <Simplar> How can I check if a string is a valid JSON before JSON.parsing it?
[19:06:39] <epolanski> why would you need to
[19:06:46] <epolanski> also, that's what parsing is for
[19:08:44] <prussian> Simplar: try / catch
[19:09:12] <prussian> welcome to the world of partial function definitions, where the base case is to throw.
[19:09:24] <prussian> much easier to do that
[19:09:50] <epolanski> what do you mean by definitions
[19:10:18] <prussian> JSON.parse only takes a subset of all possible values, thus partially defined.
[19:10:21] <prussian> well...
[19:10:39] <prussian> i guess if you except exceptions, but an except wouldn't be really a part of the type? hmm
[19:10:39] <prussian> idk
[19:10:43] <prussian> i'm too lazy for this
[19:10:55] <epolanski> partial functions are functions that are not defined for all the possible inputs
[19:10:58] <prussian> though typescript's type system can't even type exceptions as far as I know.
[19:11:05] <prussian> yes
[19:11:16] <epolanski> but that's not part of the definition
[19:11:49] <epolanski> it's just the result of the codomain not being defined wholly
[19:12:03] <epolanski> like x/y is partial, but it's not part of the "definition"
[19:12:12] <epolanski> I understand what you mean just wanted to be pedantic
[19:14:35] <prussian> I avoided using the word partial function mainly because I didn't want some misunderstanding around the variadic ways functions can be called.
[19:14:37] <prussian> but yes
[19:14:41] <prussian> I see the point

[19:46:33] <austincheney> epolanski, so what I do is ensure the string passes some tests, first data = data.replace(/^\s*/, "").replace(/\s*$/, ""):  ((data.charAt(0) === "[" && data.charAt(data.length - 1) === "]") || (data.charAt(0) === "{" && data.charAt(data.length - 1) === "}")) and then test that the data also has an expected key name
[19:47:08] <Rockwood> why not regex?
[19:47:09] <austincheney> that is not a guarantee, but it checks enough that the failure isn't transmission related
[19:47:59] <austincheney> Rockwood, i started typing a regex solution, but it was more work after accounting for optional white space and then matching the terminal brances
[19:48:28] <prussian> parsing the json or even validating its structure will be slower than handling the except
[19:48:39] <prussian> I find this incredibly unlikely to not hold true

[20:13:49] <fakuve> Hi there guyss , hope you are feeling strong today . Just a question (may have been done before) , this function as to establish a little bit of a wait in a html event to execute , that wont work is it? `    <body onload='setTimeout(alert("Yujuu"), 40000)'>`
[20:14:57] <ljharb> fakuve: never put JS inside html like that
[20:15:01] <ljharb> !inline @ fakuve
[20:15:01] <jellobot> fakuve, Inline event handlers are essentially `eval` inside HTML markup - they're bad practice and result in poorly factored, hard-to-manage code. Seriously consider attaching your events with JavaScript, instead, eg: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.addEventListener
[20:15:48] <fakuve> ljharb: oks I will cheers
[20:15:54] <ljharb> !alert @ fakuve
[20:15:54] <jellobot> fakuve, The alert() function opens a simple window that blocks your script to show a message box. For debugging purposes, you should use the console functions. See !console
[20:15:55] <ljharb> also that

[20:57:20] <ljharb> iridium__: not technical problems. but that's not a great way to do it - you should look into react.

[21:00:02] <jellobot> iridium__, Inline event handlers are essentially `eval` inside HTML markup - they're bad practice and result in poorly factored, hard-to-manage code. Seriously consider attaching your events with JavaScript, instead, eg: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.addEventListener
[21:00:29] <austincheney> iridium__, any reason why you would want to do it that way?  the network is typically the slowest part of the application.  send over the minimal that you need and have the client side JS build in response
[21:00:59] <iridium__> ljharb: oh! i'm actually puttin the javascript in a `<script>`. i meant that i'm not putting it in a separate file by `inline`.

[21:04:41] <austincheney> iridium__, if there is an initial payload the page needs you can embed that data directly in the page HTML (if it isn't massive) and this will eliminate a future http request, but that has nothing to do with sending html across the wire aside from the intial GET for the page file
[21:06:21] <iridium__> austincheney: i don't want to deal with all this stuff in the client. server-side html markup creation is much simpler for me to do. i don't think i can grasp and use a framework. it's not a large-scale app anyway.
[21:07:12] <austincheney> iridium__, i avoid large frameworks.  I don't see the point when they provide an extensive API that is often just as large or larger than the DOM they attempt to abstract away
[21:08:36] <iridium__> austincheney: me too.
[21:08:37] <ljharb> iridium__: ok so in that case, the JS can't be linted or tested

[21:09:38] <ljharb> iridium__: there are tons, which is why those templating engines have to fix so many bugs :-)
[21:10:00] <ljharb> iridium__: rolling something yourself guarantees you're ignoring all the experience and already-solved problems in the domain
[21:10:16] *** Joins: momus (~m@197.210.53.132)
[21:11:24] <iridium__> ljharb: you're experienced about this but i think it also means i'm ignoring all the learning. thankfully i can afford to fail. simplicity is my utmost priority here.
[21:12:29] <ljharb> iridium__: while that is true, that's only a cost you can choose to afford if you're the only one affected. if you have anybody using the site who isn't you, then security failures are not something you have the right to risk alone
[21:12:57] <austincheney> ljharb, that is common guidance, but it ignores the reality that popular software isn't more secure by virtue of its popularity.  The only reason to not "roll your own" is due to certification requirements applied to existing solutions, which in software seems to mostly apply to cryptographic solutions
[21:13:02] <ljharb> iridium__: if you're building something for just yourself, then absolutely! ignore all the best practices and frameworks, and play around. but as soon as others are involved, learning is not the priority.
[21:13:17] <ljharb> austincheney: not automatically. but it is more LIKELY to be secure solely by virtue of its popularity.
[21:13:30] <ljharb> since the likelihood security issues will be discovered, reported, and fixed is much higher
[21:14:15] <austincheney> ljharb, they find devasting security flaws in OSX and Windows all the time regardless of their popularity.  the likelihood is unchanged.
[21:14:19] <iridium__> ljharb: yeah. it's not a bank or a hospital though. and i don't think i'll use a framework anytime in my life. i just managed to learn JavaScript and coming from a functional background, i love it. i'm not going to waste time to learn a new framework that's going to be outdated in five years when Facebook decided to break it.
[21:14:45] <ljharb> austincheney: the likelihood is changed; the continued existence of flaws doesn't invalidate the likelihood.
[21:14:56] <ljharb> iridium__: that's not how things happen tho
[21:15:04] <iridium__> ljharb: i'm not harvesting any users data nor do i plan to do it anytime in the future. it's all going to be open source. i think that should be enough.
[21:15:05] <ljharb> iridium__: react has been around for 9 years, angular for about as long
[21:15:29] <ljharb> iridium__: if you have no data storage whatsoever, and no serverside redirection or API requests, then yeah, you might be fine there
[21:15:31] <iridium__> ljharb: they keep changing stuff all the time and it's so complex. it reminds me of OOP with all the complexity.
[21:15:33] <ljharb> iridium__: but that's a lot of "ifs"
[21:15:40] <ljharb> iridium__: the big stuff really doesn't change all that much
[21:16:08] <ljharb> iridium__: and the complexity always exists - if you're not using a framework, then you're forcing the complexity to be in your own code, either by it being there to prevent bugs, or by its absence causing them.

[21:34:10] <prussian> better to just inject known good js that interprets the contents of a serialized json in another script tag.
[21:34:17] <prussian> also the nonce attribute and CSP is your friend.

[21:49:19] <onosendi> For unit tests, does every function I test need to be exported?
[21:49:22] <iridium__> prussian: if there is no match, that throws an exception.
[21:49:51] <ljharb> iridium__: that's what JS pattern matching absolutely will do by default; nothing else is remotely sensible
[21:49:58] <iridium__> prussian: i meant something in the style of Haskell or Erlang. the spec feature request describes it like that.
[21:50:08] <ljharb> iridium__: you can override that with your own `else`, but obviously it would be exhaustive by default, for safety.
[21:50:58] <ljharb> onosendi: yes, never test private things
[21:51:20] <ljharb> onosendi: iow, if it's reachable, test it; if it's meant to be private, it shouldn't be reachable; if it's not reachable, you shouldn't make it reachable just for the purposes of testing it.
[21:52:33] <iridium__> ljharb: yeah, that's like partial application in functions. that makes sense. what i meant was that destructuring is not pattern matching as it throws error right then and there if the destructuring fails. that makes it useless as pattern matcher.
[21:52:49] <prussian> iridium__: not the same? rescript is compile-to-js and the patterns are exhaustively checked.
[21:52:58] <prussian> confused by your statement.
[21:53:03] <ljharb> iridium__: destructuring does not throw an error right then
[21:53:04] <prussian> I was more trolling honestly

[21:53:13] <jellobot> iridium__, [ 1, undefined ]
[21:53:25] <ljharb> iridium__: destructuring just silently gives you undefined, like property access would
[21:53:51] <ljharb> iridium__: the difference is that you'd have to runtime-check the destructured property names to decide if the match succeeded or not.
[21:54:23] <iridium__> ljharb: oh yeah it returns undefined.
[21:54:55] <iridium__> ljharb: i meant that to be work as a pattern matcher, i would have to check on every destructure statement val to be undefined to move on.
[21:56:45] <iridium__> i remembered it wrong. in any case, a match would be extremely powerful.

[22:08:36] <iridium__> prussian: if this gave any indication of a failure of the destructuring because of difference of "types", that would have been more powerful. a pattern match could be undefined due to a number of reasons. destructuring presumes one knows what the pattern is beforehand instead of what the pattern could be from a  list of patterns. in native JS, i mean.
[22:09:32] <iridium__> prussian: but that's not the purpose of destructuring then. it only becomes when one tries to use it as pattern-matcher.
