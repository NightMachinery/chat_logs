[04:40:49] <Namarrgon> randomxusr: you switched to openssh or are you still using dropbear?
[04:42:06] <randomxusr> still using dropbear
[04:42:10] <Repentinus> randomxusr, hint: pacman -Ql dropbear
[04:42:28] <Namarrgon> what made you think that dropbear reads the openssh configs?

[04:45:20] <Namarrgon> you have to specify all options as arguments to the dropbear call, it doesn't support a config at all

[05:01:10] *** Quits: beastDivision (~beastDivi@user/beastdivision) (Remote host closed the connection)
[05:01:14] <randomxusr> Yea, that's completely not my scenario. I've got Full Disk Encryption but physically at the machine. and Don't give two hoots about using dropbear for that

[05:02:08] *** Joins: beastDivision (~beastDivi@user/beastdivision)
[05:02:24] <Repentinus> Yeah, the reason for Dropbear's and TinySSH's existence is space constraints. In practice that means either putting them in the initramfs or on embedded devices like routers. (OpenWrt uses Dropbear by default.)
[05:02:49] <Repentinus> Unless you are in a space constrained environment, go with OpenSSH. Almost all the documentation out there is for OpenSSH.

[23:10:10] <Timvde> I'm trying to install python-ldap in a virtualenv with pip, but there is no package providing the ldap_r libbrary.

[23:10:17] <Timvde> I could maybe symlink ldap_r.so to ldap.so?

[23:42:41] <rcf> Timvde: libldap_r used to be the thread-safe version of libldap. Now that that the non-thread-safe version is no longer supported they can just call it libldap. 
[23:42:43] <John_Ivan> heh. heh. heh.
[23:43:45] <rcf> Timvde: Fedora do include the symlink, Arch probably won't bother unless actual package maintainers complain. 
[23:44:03] <Timvde> Oh, and the upstream package probably still uses it for compatibility with older distros, assuming that newer distros will provide compatibility
[23:44:12] <Timvde> Makes sense. Thanks.
[23:44:20] <Timvde> I'll just go with the manual symlink then :)

[23:57:09] <Repentinus> So your problem is !notarch.
[23:57:16] <Repentinus> That thing from 2017 is broken.
[23:57:34] <Repentinus> Should ask the developer for support with that.
