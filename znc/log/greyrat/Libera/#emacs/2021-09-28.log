[00:23:11] <acdw> EMACS question: How do i keep org-mode from like, running hooks when exporting? I think that's what's going on... i export a buffer to HTML temporarily and it keeps turning ispell mode on in that buffer, which i don't need
[00:23:27] <johnjay> Psybur: idk depends on what you mean by better?
[00:23:40] <Psybur> I mean, produce correct Python

[00:25:25] <johnjay> Psybur: smartparens does have multi-language support so I guess poke around https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens/blob/master/smartparens-python.el
[00:25:30] <johnjay> see if there's something you can use
[00:25:57] <dale> Psybur: Though here, sp-forward-slurp-sexp does turn g(f(1|), 2) (with point at |) into g(f(1, 2)) incidentally.  Does that not work for you?
[00:26:21] <Psybur> johnjay, i have looked in there, looks like its just support for things like tripple quotes and some extra functions but nothing drastic like handling comma separated sexps in slurp/barf
[00:26:35] <johnjay> then why does it work for dale
[00:26:37] *** Joins: jje_ (jje@user/jje)
[00:26:44] <johnjay> that seems like an obvious thing to support
[00:27:09] <dale> Well, the answer is quite likely that I have tweaked Python in Emacs a lot.
[00:27:15] <Psybur> Hmm let me check again, one sec
[00:27:19] <dale> Psybur: https://github.com/dsedivec/dot-emacs-d/blob/f071ed0ca74b6d76ea4d52a28e8773f145360c35/init.el#L3400-L3410 might help you.  It might make things worse.
[00:27:26] <dale> I was not testing in emacs -q.
[00:28:09] <Psybur> oh that works for me too, I was simplifying this from another bit of code heh
[00:28:24] <Psybur> Let me see if I can actually reproduce. I feel silly
[00:29:00] <dale> What actually bugs me is that transpose-sexps in f(foo, |bar.baz) with point at | doesn't give me f(bar.baz, foo), but rather f(bar, foo.baz).
[00:30:31] <Psybur> So Im actually in MMM haha, my mode is Python[SQL[ANSI]] im in a SQL string
[00:30:54] <Psybur> Must be a sql mode issue then
[00:31:54] <Psybur> yeah I copied the code out into python mode and it worked as expected

[01:53:13] <dale> It is very speculative, reading it again.

[01:54:07] <bpalmer> The CW is the result of merging the WB and UPN channels

[03:03:54] <technomancy> still worth it

[09:19:40] <twb> It makes preimage so much harder
[09:20:22] <twb> Also why isn't there an option like "b2sums /path/to/dir" which generates /path/to/dir/B2SUMS and strips out the parent dir.

[09:24:54] <mattcen> Not that that actually answers your question.

[09:25:37] <mattcen> > cksum now supports the -a (--algorithm) option to select any of the existing sum, md5sum, b2sum, sha*sum implementations etc.  cksum now subsumes all of these programs, and coreutils will introduce no future standalone checksum utility.

[13:58:47] <jtgd> generally yes. They connect to each other and exchange/propagate messages around so they should all have the same. But they might not all have the same groups. A lightweight one might not carry any binary groups
[13:58:48] <jbe> I would guess they have mostly the same newsgroups
[13:59:17] <jbe> I don't think any of the mentioned have the binary ones
[14:00:03] <jtgd> The selling point of ones like newshosting is high bandwidth and long retention of msgs, neither of which would be needed by you, unless you want really old msgs

[14:01:59] <jtgd> what plan did you sign up for?

[16:19:41] <rpav> yup! https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/ggd90c/color_emoji_in_emacs_27/
[16:19:59] <rpav> that font and the set-fontset-font call do the trick; now i have better/common emoji .. thanks for pointing out that font!

[16:20:12] <skangas> Nice! Happy to help.
[16:20:27] <rpav> (note emojify is still useful for inserting them and/or translating :github-style: etc if you want)
[16:20:50] <skangas> Honestly, Emacs should come with a set of font recommendations.
[16:20:54] <rpav> personally i find the github or emoticon translation too much, but insertion is nice
[16:21:38] <rpav> skangas: i think it defaults to the gnu fonts ;)

[16:24:42] <rpav> well, freefonts are pretty bad ime
[16:25:07] <skangas> Freefonts as in any free font?
[16:25:13] <rpav> https://www.gnu.org/software/freefont/ <- like what is going on with baselines and kerning there
[16:25:22] <rpav> specifically gnu freefont
[16:26:29] <rpav> but really i think it defaults to probably X defaults (it may be freefont on windows?), which can be pretty bad since modern dists tend to ignore them, or xft defaults which can be similar (dejavu or whatever sucks too)
[16:27:53] <skangas> Is that the default?

[16:28:52] <skangas> Yeah it sounds like a Windows thing then, because I'm seeing Bitstream Vera Sans here in "emacs -Q".
[16:29:27] <rpav> ok actually dejavu sans mono or whatever isn't terrible
[16:29:51] <rpav> maybe that's the one i'm thinking not sure .. definitely some of the bitmap fonts when scaled are horrible
[16:30:09] <skangas> Yeah, my thinking is that the default is okay but it could be better.
[16:30:12] <rpav> though i really want nice crisp fonts again :(

[16:30:28] <rpav> i'm a bit tired of the fuzzy fonts, and running xterm with like 6x13 is just amazing
[16:30:32] <skangas> For example, why not just use a very nice and highly popular font instead if it is installed and available.

[19:09:26] <johnjay> so having a 'project' means something like A) version control and B) limiting operations like search replace and buffers to a predefined root dir

[19:56:07] <krux02> technomancy, as a compiler developer and developer in many different languages such as Java Scala Lisp C++ Go and Nim I can pretty much boil down to: A language has structs/pointers/array it is high performance, low performance otherwise.

[20:01:44] <technomancy> krux02: that's what I'm saying; you don't need pointers in the language semantics
[20:02:14] <krux02> this allows javascript to work with overhead free floating point values, if you then work with arrays of floats instead of arrays of objects, you are still very fast.
[20:03:04] <krux02> the problem with javascript however is, composed types often need to store object headers or something similar, they can't be optimized away, and for the programmer it is not ovious to see if this is the case or not.
[20:03:24] <krux02> in other words only some parts of a languae can be optimized to be fast

[20:04:32] <krux02> of course you can say "javascript is as fast as C" in these problems. But you also have to look at the price you have to pay in order to be high performant.

[20:08:20] <krux02> technomancy, the point is, you can develop a language that is faster than javascript in your spare time, if it has abstractions similar to C. But implementing all these optimizations to be comparable to C in a language like lua/javascript, nope takes may lifetimes.
[20:08:21] <hodapp> it is letting you refer to an aggregation of values as a single entity, which is pretty much the definition of indirection
[20:08:47] <technomancy> like ... elisp has defstruct. it compiles to lists but you could make a better compiler for it which compiled it to something more efficient. it wouldn't change the language.

[20:15:24] <krux02> andreyorst, yes it failed commertially, but the reason for that was, even compared to interpreted lisp on a normal CPU the lisp machine was slower, and therefore the lisp machines failed commertially. And I consider that faild, not just commertially failed.
[20:16:17] <andreyorst> If I remember the historry correct enough, there were two competing companies, one of which got bancrupt and the other lost motivation as there were no other competitors to push them
[20:17:04] <andreyorst> I don't disagree with you, I just think that lisp machines is still a largely unexplored technology
[20:17:45] <krux02> technomancy, there is another point I would like to make. I it is very hard to know what optimizations a compiler does (both Jit or Aot), therefore I consider it easier to write high performance code in a language that doesn't rely on heave optimizations from the compiler in order to be fast
[20:18:20] *** Joins: JordiGH (~jordi@user/jordigh)
[20:18:32] <technomancy> krux02: oh yeah for sure. I think it's more helpful to think about a language as providing an effort:speed curve and an upper bound on speed than it is to think of a language as "fast vs slow"
[20:18:50] <andreyorst> it's like saying that the very early intel cpus are slow as hell from today's perspective. If lisp machines were evolving since then I'm sure the would be fast enough. It's just that the lisp boom faded away, and C became defacto language for systems programming, so there was very little interest in implementing an architecture around lisp, and hence no real progress was made since
[20:18:50] <hodapp> it's only "easier" if you aren't required to then reinvent a bunch of things from scratch in order to get the abstractions you need

[20:20:48] <hodapp> so the principle of "it's easier to write it faster in a low-level language" really doesn't hold, unless you happen to be dealing with a problem that's already pretty low-level

[20:21:42] <krux02> there are so many more components that affect performance than just the problem size

[20:21:57] <hodapp> the fact that other things also matter doesn't mean asymptotic performance is irrelevant
[20:22:10] <andreyorst> krux02: sure, yet everyone understands it, so that's that
[20:22:38] <hodapp> and indeed one of the reasons that things like Clojure are fairly performant is from having some very meticulously-designed data structures that mind that asymptotic complexity
[20:23:02] <krux02> one of the biggest factor in high performance computing is cache locality. Something that is completely ignored in big O
[20:23:28] <andreyorst> hodapp:  I think krux02 meant things like level 2 cahce misses and other low level stuff that kinda ignored by big O notation
[20:23:30] <hodapp> cache locality is not going to save you if your algorithm scales like shit
[20:23:37] <krux02> hodapp, well I would disagree on Clojure being fairly performant.
[20:24:10] <technomancy> andreyorst: it's admittedly pedantic but you could easily have the bulk of the time taken up by (for example) VM startup or a GC cycle
[20:24:14] <krux02> scalability isn't everything, knowing your expected problem size is important.
[20:24:29] <hodapp> krux02: big-O notation is literally about computing your expected problem size
[20:25:06] <krux02> hodapp, no it is not, it expects an input n, N is the problem size.
[20:27:32] <hodapp> ...and it literally tells you how much of a problem that input size might be
[20:28:24] <krux02> hodapp, regarding performance of Clojure (or JVM languages in general). Often preformance is measured in a way to cut off the time the JVM needs to optimize the code.

[21:06:15] <acdw> yeah^^^
[21:06:23] <greyrat> skangas: Isn't that less efficient though?
[21:06:42] <greyrat> In this case though, I just want to see if the last char is a '/'. Any better way for this?
[21:06:56] <skangas> I don't think it will make a noticeable difference.
[21:07:28] <skangas> It depends on what you're doing. Is this in a particularly performance critical section?

[21:07:54] <greyrat> No, it's fine, but it just seems like a waste to let a ready, efficient function go :))
[21:08:18] <acdw> you could also do something like, (string= (substring -1 str) "/")
[21:08:23] <greyrat> Nice!
[21:08:30] <acdw> or however substring works, i haven't looked that hard
[21:08:40] <greyrat> I'll check it out
[21:08:41] <acdw> yeah i'm dumb. (substring str -1)

[21:09:36] <acdw> ^^ yeah, it's like, speed would matter if you're doing 10,000 of those matches per second, right?
[21:09:44] <skangas> Unless you specifically need to save match data, you can replace that with (string-match "o$" "foo")

[23:37:55] <krux02> best bike infrastructure is netherlands. There really is no country next to it.
[23:38:00] <parsnip> which is common on approach to bus stops, to not have the plastic columns. so cars constantly stop in the approach
[23:38:04] <parsnip> yes

[23:38:52] <grym> you can see the attempt to prevent right-hooking with the white striped box approaching the intersection, but it's only so useful 
[23:38:53] <parsnip> yeah we have those near my barber shop, for example
[23:38:57] <krux02> you instantly know when you leave Germany.
