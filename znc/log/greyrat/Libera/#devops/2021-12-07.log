[00:04:51] <Latrina> what up?
[00:06:35] <slaughter> Doing the `dev` part of `devops` and straight up not having a good time. Turns out rails isn't the magic everyone claims
[00:09:36] <Latrina> no clue
[00:09:46] <Latrina> I am a sysadmin 
[00:10:08] <Latrina> I need to do some devops shit but I wouldn't know where to begin 
[00:10:22] <Latrina> I can do ansible, a bit of salt, but that's it
[00:11:56] <rawtaz> slaughter: the best thing you can do with rails is to ditch it and move on to something else :) e.g. elixir
[00:12:32] <slaughter> rawtaz BRB rewriting an almost decade old monolithic rails app in something else
[00:12:32] <Latrina> whats rails btw? I have heard about it before
[00:12:41] <Latrina> like ruby on rails ..
[00:12:48] <rawtaz> that
[00:12:53] <slaughter> Yeah ruby on rails
[00:12:53] <rawtaz> slaughter: what are you rewriting it in?
[00:13:01] <Latrina> yeah for me sounds like nigger on heroin 
[00:13:02] <slaughter> I'm not rewriting anything lol I was being very sarcastic
[00:13:06] <Latrina> or something like that
[00:13:11] <Latrina> no disripect btw
[00:13:16] <slaughter> Woah what the fuck dude
[00:13:18] <Latrina> I do heroin too
[00:13:25] <Latrina> anyways
[00:13:26] <rawtaz> slaughter: hehe ok :)
[00:13:48] <Latrina> I know ruby is a language 
[00:14:02] <Latrina> I better google rails
[00:17:03] <slaughter> Gotta say I'm really personally not at all OK with language like that Latrina. Can you not do that again, thanks
[00:17:31] <rawtaz> slaughter: the "n on h" part?
[00:17:48] <Latrina> slaughter, was a joke
[00:18:10] <Latrina> didn't mean to be disrespectful
[00:18:12] <Latrina> sorry
[00:18:25] <Latrina> I can leave if you wish so
[00:18:51] <Latrina> in fact, maybe I should
[00:18:53] *** Parts: Latrina (~Latrina@user/latrina) (Leaving)
[00:18:54] <slaughter> Just keep the racism to yourself
[00:18:56] <rawtaz> lets just be friends :) it was an unfortunate thing to say but wasnt intentional
[00:19:00] <slaughter> Not a funny joke
[00:19:33] <slaughter> I don't even understand how it was a joke
[00:20:02] <rawtaz> me neither. but im pretty sure it wasnt intentional or similar. just bad wording..
[00:20:22] * slaughter shrugs
[00:20:44] <slaughter> Didn't mean to make anyone leave just hot damn 
[00:21:32] <rawtaz> ill PM them and ask them to come back when its cooled off a bit. i think neither of you meant any harm or similar towards the other, its just a matter of different backgrounds and perhaps somet shortsightedness in wording
[00:21:37] <rawtaz> dont worry about it :)
[00:21:51] <slaughter> Too busy fighting rails to worry about much
[00:21:59] <slaughter> ðŸ™ƒ
[00:22:18] <rawtaz> haha yeah
[00:24:27] <kwilczynski> What is going on hre.

[00:25:26] <slaughter> Uh going on 10 years yeah
[00:25:41] <slaughter> Pre-dates me by long enough I'm not entirely sure but I know it's more than 8

[00:28:33] <slaughter> kwilczynski Saint maria mother of the day hurry?
[00:29:45] <lantech19446> so rawtaz I've done some searching on iac vs iaas and it's nowhere near as simple as you make it out to be, maybe I asked something you're not aware of and that's why the snippy response. But my entire point for asking is that both are technically code so I didn't understand where the delineation was such that iaas is a cloud service and iac can be anywhere including on premises
[00:30:35] <kwilczynski> slaughter: No...

[00:31:13] <slaughter> I guess I could have shoved that into translate myself heh
[00:31:41] <slaughter> Yeah it's not amazing. I guess for the rails devs it's great but once you start trying the system together it proves...problematic
[00:32:00] <rawtaz> slaughter: just to let you know, it was super duper unintentional and wasnt meant as offending in any way. just accidental bad wording. theyll be back and they seem to have the highest respect for everyone regardless of color etc. just so you know :)
[00:32:19] <slaughter> And our whole stack is setup to run via a tool that does not support M1 macs and I'm the only person so far with one so I'm on my own as far as getting anything going
[00:32:30] <rawtaz> oh youre the locky one with the m1 :-)
[00:32:34] <kubblai> lantech19446: iac can be used for example on prem with your own openstack env, so you're actually the owner of the hardware. however with iaas you dont usually own the hardware
[00:32:43] <slaughter> rawtaz thanks for following up. I understand the whole world isn't america, I guess
[00:32:44] <rawtaz> i fiddled with an m1 yesterday, i can see theres some issues to work around :/
[00:32:56] <slaughter> Yeah the M1 is pretty amazing outside of this rails app, actually
[00:33:00] <kwilczynski> slaughter: This is how I picture your work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4ALzqqUIS8
[00:33:03] <slaughter> I've got everything else working like a charm
[00:33:10] <rawtaz> slaughter: yeah. i pull bad jokes sometimes too. im slowly learning that im not able to think ahead well enough now and then :<

[00:36:04] * slaughter sobs
[00:36:07] <rawtaz> lantech19446: i really dont agree :) like i said the other day, IaC is *code*, and IaaS is a *service*.

[00:36:16] <slaughter> That does feel better :)
[00:36:21] <kwilczynski> Told ya!
[00:36:25] <rawtaz> they are indeed very related, its just a matter of how theyre packaged basically :P
[00:36:27] <kwilczynski> slaughter: *hugs*
[00:36:39] <slaughter> Better watch out I'll sob on your clothes

[00:36:49] <kwilczynski> Yikes.
[00:36:50] <kwilczynski> :)
[00:36:51] <rawtaz> lantech19446: i didnt mean to insinuate youre dumb or anything yesterday. ill spare that for something else youll ask in the future :P
[00:37:41] <lantech19446> rawtaz: IaaS is also code though so that explanation doesn't really help and I had no idea that IaaS was a cloud thing either, you have to remember I'm really really new to devops you know exponentially more than I do. I just ask that you don't assume I know more than I do, and that's a rare ask because usually I do know stuff and people assume I don't and then I get pissed off 
[00:38:11] <rawtaz> lantech19446: heh i understand
[00:38:12] <kwilczynski> IaaaWWWW
[00:38:18] <kwilczynski> Yawning as a service, oi.
[00:38:22] <kwilczynski> :)
[00:38:26] <rawtaz> when i was saying service i was thinking in terms of cloud, i thought you had already loooked that up. sorry
[00:38:29] * kwilczynski will see himself out...
[00:38:36] <slaughter> IaC manages IaaS - IaaS by itself isn't code
[00:38:50] <kwilczynski> slaughter: Unless! It's the Copilot!
[00:38:52] <kwilczynski> It's alive!
[00:39:06] <slaughter> Which copilot do you refer to
[00:39:21] <slaughter> Because I deal with AWS Copilot daily and also there's Github Copilot and I get confused
[00:39:21] <kwilczynski> The one that write code with bugs for you.
[00:39:25] <lantech19446> usually you guys give me better answers than I can google right off the bat so normally i ask you and then I go google deeper I had no idea it was a cloud tech yet
[00:39:27] <kwilczynski> Based on the other smart thing.

[00:39:50] <rawtaz> lantech19446: either way - dont bother too much trying to take these two appreviations and translate them into a specific explanation of what they are. these things, as most in devops and related fields, are quite dynamic and flexible and come in many different fashions. it's better that you just try some of it out. e.g. AWS
[00:40:00] <kwilczynski> I am convinced that Copilot wrote itself... and then decided to host itself on GitHub... and then... SINGULARITY!
[00:40:09] <kwilczynski> :P
[00:40:11] <rawtaz> you'd haev to nail a *really* generic description to make it apply to all the IaaS out there for example
[00:40:50] <kwilczynski> DevOps - Bugs as a Service.
[00:40:51] <kwilczynski> :)
[00:41:08] <lantech19446> hmm ok and it's probably some time before I get around to messing with it because right now i'm learning python and ansible and next I want to learn docker I have a whole obsidian document of stuff to learn
[00:41:25] <slaughter> I've found Copilot useful for a very limited set of things for me, tbh. Config files. I imagine it's got some uses in code, and if I was bonking around on a dev side project I might use it for boilerplate
[00:41:41] <rawtaz> lantech19446: one step at a time. its easy to get sidetracked when finding new concepts and stuff to look into all the time
[00:43:17] <lantech19446> yea tell me about it, there's just so much stuff i've never touched as a sys admin and now my brain is trying to take it all in there's a lot to learn
[00:43:46] <rawtaz> you cna keep doing that forever. at some point you have to focus on something and try to make that be in line with what job youre looking for in the end.
[00:44:08] <rawtaz> its hard to find jobs as a generalist that can do a lot of things but isnt very experienced with something specific
[00:44:51] <kwilczynski> Or like me, without any experience :)
[00:45:26] <lantech19446> rawtaz: is it worth specializing in something like ansible or is that something everyone knows
[00:46:05] <rawtaz> ansible is often sought for or mentioned as a requirement in job ads, but its not like its the main player. noone is looking for an ansible engineer so to speak, at least not where i look
[00:46:20] <rawtaz> but it does indeed help to have experience with ansible so you can use it
[00:46:31] <kwilczynski> Yes. A part of the tool belt?
[00:46:39] <rawtaz> yeah
[00:46:39] <lantech19446> ok
[00:47:07] <rawtaz> and out of the similar products i'd argue that ansible is the one to spend time with, screw the others
[00:47:29] <kwilczynski> Nobody uses CFEnginer any more, hardly Chef and Puppet.
[00:47:34] <kwilczynski> Ansible and perhaps SaltStack.
[00:47:35] <kubblai> job wise you'd be better suited spending time learning terraform for azure or aws
[00:47:38] <kwilczynski> Nowadays.
[00:47:50] <kwilczynski> kubblai: No GCP? :<
[00:48:03] <kubblai> sorry but he wants a job im just working %s
[00:49:16] <kubblai> personally i use DO but never ever seen a job advertising for tf with DO
[00:55:53] <lantech19446> I want to get certified in AWS so terraform is probably a good way to go. I heard cloudformation was important too though
[00:56:42] <rawtaz> heh you could go all in on AWS certifications
[00:56:51] <rawtaz> that will keep you busy for hte rest of your life and probably get you a job as well
[00:57:45] <slaughter> Yeah getting the first AWS cert forces you to learn a lot of useful stuff
[00:57:51] <lantech19446> I figure at least an entry level one like cloud practitioner or whatever it's called just because I have nothing on my resume to show experience with cloud technologies
[00:58:10] <slaughter> And there's soooooooooo many good guides/courses/whatever to use for studying that take the "wtf" out a bit

[01:09:52] <lantech19446> that's good to here slaughter because i'm really fighting up stream from behind an 8 ball on this stuff
[01:11:14] <slaughter> Nah you just think you are. There's a ton to learn but it's not like you have to/need to/even want to learn it all at once
[01:11:28] <slaughter> You're probably way ahead of where you think you are, just looking at it from way too high up :)
[01:12:13] <lantech19446> when I look at job listings I see so much shit I don't know that they list as required and I don't even know how to wade through the BS yet because this stuff is orders of magnitude more involved than just being a sys admin
[01:13:29] <rawtaz> the problem isnt so much that the stuff is complex, the problem is taht even if you learn how it works, you dont have experience. you cannto get much real world experience with theory or a small lab. you need to work somewhere they use these things to get relevant experience
[01:15:12] <lantech19446> and it seems like no one wants to give that real world experience without real world experience
[01:15:49] <rawtaz> yes
[01:16:29] <rawtaz> and this ^ is why you need to narrow what you aim for down a bit, because learning too much will just leave you in the end with no relevant actual practical experience.
[01:20:54] <lantech19446> so get better at programming and maybe an aws cert and then start looking

[13:59:42] <shad> Hey, so i've developed a full stack application and got it running on k8s with kustomize. I have a Flask API and a React front end, each their Dockerfile pushing to our gitlab registry, all is well
[13:59:52] <shad> Now I do have a question regarding how you'd manage environment and making a production build of a React App ; the only env var I need at build time is REACT_APP_API_URL, to tell my front where to direct its API requests
[14:00:25] <shad> Now, the API url has to be baked a build time, so should my `yarn build` be a RUN command and I'd need to have the right API url at docker build time, or should I CMD `yarn build && serve -s build/`, and be able to provide the API URL at
[14:00:50] <shad> 'm not a huge fan of having to `yarn build` everytime the docker image is started, but i don't know how else i can provide the API URL
[14:03:56] <rawtaz> shad: why can you not just make the application read that environment variable at runtime instead of build time?
[14:04:47] <shad> rawtaz: because that's how react application are made i'm afraid
[14:05:10] <shad> there's no "runtime" in production build of webapps, not in client side rendering at least
[14:05:31] <rawtaz> oh right. gah, so silly.
[14:05:54] <shad> when i "yarn build" i make a Ì€`build/` directory that contains minified JS files that are statically served, by `serve` in my case
[14:08:53] <rawtaz> so what *is* your API URL? isnt it something that is static enough that you can just supply it at build time ?
[14:09:26] <rawtaz> i imagine it's something like https://toysrus.com/api/v2/ or whatever, unlikely to change 
[14:09:57] <shad> well, in a perfect world i'd be able to change the API URL at runtime, so i'd be able to direct a Docker image of my front end to some dev/stage API_URL instead of production
[14:10:18] <shad> this means i need to build docker image per targeted env, which is sub-optimal
[14:10:38] <rawtaz> how many envs do you have?
[14:10:47] <simplicity> Well. Some React apps are built so they can read environment variables. The frontend team at my last employer was able to do so.
[14:10:54] <rawtaz> if you have like dev, staging, prod, thats just three urls. three images
[14:12:07] <shad> Did they `CMD yarn build && yarn run:prod` though ? 
[14:12:22] <shad> did they even run production builds ?
[14:13:25] <rawtaz> i dnot really understand theproblem. if you haev say three envs/different URLs, whats the problem building three different images? its not like it takes a ton of more resources.
[14:16:01] <shad> well that's one solution, but having to build 3 different images for one url irks me :p
[14:18:29] <rawtaz> i agree compltely :) i'd just be pragmatic about it. if theres a way to read the env var during runtime, then do it if it makes sense and isnt convoluted/complex, otherwise just go with this. no biggie. you still have separate systems for dev, staging etc so nothing really wrong with having separate images either. FWIW they could contain other additional tooling and what not as well, further justifying being deparate images

[15:02:16] <shad> well, i have a new conceptual problem to show you guys now
[15:02:48] <shad> So i've made a REST API with Flask and a front-end client in react, whole thing running in k8s because it's cool
[15:03:23] <shad> Now, in order to use the API to do significant stuff, I needed an admin user at creation that could create new users, resources, etc..
[15:04:15] <shad> For now, i've sticked the creation of this user in a database migration script, using an UUID for its password that I retrieve from the migration job logs. Is there a better, more meta, way to do this ?
[15:10:08] <rawtaz> is the build populating a secret store with that password? or how do you document it
[15:22:44] <shad> rawtaz: I have a kubernetes job that does `FLASK_APP=app.py flask db upgrade` against my production database
[15:23:45] <shad> that in turn runs alembic scripts that setup my database table, and create that user in the process. The password is just "password = uuid.v4()`, then bcrypt hashed into db, then written on the job stdout
[15:27:30] <rawtaz> ok
[15:27:54] <rawtaz> so how do you document or store that password where you have your other secrets :)
[15:29:24] <shad> well i'm not supposed to run that migration script more than once at all, so i'd just stick the password in my password manager and forget about it :D
[15:30:16] <shad> i might be able to have the migration script put it in k8s secrets instead of stdout, but that would mean finding out how to access k8s from within that script
[15:31:34] <rawtaz> ah ok manual. was just wondering. i mean if it's on that level of "automation" then that seems pragmatic and fine to me :)
[15:32:43] <shad> thing is, that project security is critical af. It will run ansible jobs on our edge devices, and cannot ever be compromised
[15:33:11] <shad> having an admin password just stdout doesn't seem right to me at all :D
[15:33:14] <rawtaz> you mean that as if it would get compromised we all die? :)
[15:34:05] <shad> i mean it will be able to run ansible as root on an inventory of devices, and that is scary
[15:34:34] <shad> well, there's also a bit of https://xkcd.com/538/ involved too
[15:51:44] <rawtaz> :D

[21:20:25] <Dus10> I am nearing the point where I think Ansible should just be used to run pipelines
[21:20:33] <Dus10> being YAML-based... why not
[21:21:42] <Dus10> since there are so many modules and roles available, it would make it a very powerful platform already that would be highly extensible
[21:21:53] <Dus10> and use skills that many folks already have
[21:22:21] <rawtaz> is it not already used for that :O
[21:22:49] <Dus10> pretty close already, that is what I mean

[21:27:45] <Dus10> not very happy already
[21:28:04] <Dus10> he is EXTREMELY opinionated...
[21:28:08] <Dus10> I shouldn't know that already
[21:28:40] <Dus10> I should learn that over time when he continually feeds me great information and I develop some sense in trust of his opinion
[21:29:03] <Dus10> and the things he has an opinion on... I am not super inline with
[21:29:46] <Edgan> Dus10: example(s)?
[21:31:38] <Dus10> eh, he was just in talking with one of my engineers and explaining to him about how certain aspects of Terraform work...
[21:32:00] <Dus10> the engineer that he was explaining it  to... I would consider an absolute expert on Terraform
[21:32:14] <lantech19446> Dus10: I meant to ask you the other day when we were talking is terraform free if I wanted to learn it?
[21:32:26] <Dus10> he has written a bunch of tools in Go that I am hoping that he will contribute to Terraform at some point
[21:32:46] <Dus10> lantech19446: huh?  Absolutely, Terrraform is free
[21:32:50] <Dus10> it is OSS
[21:33:13] <Dus10> best way to get started is learn.hashicorp.com
[21:33:15] <lantech19446> nice, apparently there's a lot of high end free software in devops
[21:33:41] <lantech19446> ok bookmarked it for when i'm ready
[21:33:49] <Dus10> as far as Infrastructure as Code goes, it is Terraform, Ansible, and Packer that do the heavy lifting

[21:34:04] <Dus10> all of them are OSS
[21:34:21] <lantech19446> I'm learning ansible right now I've actually implemented it at my work for updating all sorts of things, haven't done a deployment with it yet
[21:34:33] <Dus10> and Packer is to Ansible as Bread is to Butter...
[21:34:41] <lantech19446> I'll have to add packer to my list, this is the first i'm hearing about it
[21:34:50] <Dus10> Bread is a good delivery medium for Butter :)
[21:35:14] <Dus10> Packer is for building images (containers and VMs... almost entirely VMs, though)
[21:35:22] <rawtaz> Dus10: can you elaborate on the consultant opinionation?
[21:35:41] <Dus10> it is basically a shim between the platform that you're building an image for and running Ansible, the way I use it
[21:35:41] <lantech19446> ok so docker for containers packer for vm's
[21:35:57] <Dus10> basically, lantech19446 
[21:36:06] <Dus10> rawtaz: well, the guy doesn't let anyone talk, ever
[21:36:07] <rawtaz> lantech19446: seriously, and im not saying this to be a douche, finding whether terraform is free to use or not is something you should google. dont waste people's time on *that* type of question. save it for when you have questions that you *really* need help with. just a tip.
[21:36:19] <Dus10> even during our interview process... I didn't get to ask the questions that I wanted
[21:36:22] <rawtaz> Dus10: hehe i have seen some of those so i hear ya :D
[21:36:39] <Dus10> but he was really the only candidate that had skill to hit the ground running
[21:36:48] <rawtaz> so he's socially incompetent :)
[21:36:49] <Dus10> so, everyone was fired up to bring him on
[21:37:41] <Dus10> and he had some of that defensive behavior going on during the interview, on camera
[21:37:53] <Dus10> he had a bit of that attitude that he didn't have to prove anything
[21:37:54] <rawtaz> i guess that maybe having a serious talk with him could calm things down a bit. dont give up yet :3
[21:37:58] <Dus10> we should just hand him the job
[21:39:31] <Dus10> yeah, but not in the normal way
[21:39:40] <Dus10> he is at the other end of the spectrum
[21:39:45] <lantech19446> is he that good Dus10 ? Maybe he's autistic and is socially awkward
[21:39:59] <Dus10> yeah, that is what I told my engineer I would do
[21:40:10] <Edgan> Dus10: You have explained personal and communication skills, but do you have an example of the "not super inline with" part?
[21:40:26] <Dus10> just find an opportunity to address the behavior without making it apparent that it was a complaint

[21:41:23] <Dus10> even if he is a problem... he can still be useful

[21:42:19] <rawtaz> wouldnt wnat someone to code up things completely differently than you want them done in your organization
[21:43:00] <Dus10> he is the opposite of autistic
[21:43:13] <lantech19446> socially overzealous?
[21:43:25] <Dus10> Edgan: well, one example was using Terraform workspaces
[21:43:32] <Dus10> not in Terraform Cloud
[21:43:52] <lantech19446> I know plenty of people with aspergers who are confident and sometimes it seems overly so because they don't take social cues well so I'm not sure what the opposite would be
[21:43:56] <Dus10> there isn't a ton of value in them, really
[21:44:02] <Dus10> I initially thought they would be useful... but when you're running everything from a pipeline, they're effectively worthless
[21:44:41] <Dus10> they could be used as some organization medium, but then you can just store state and otherwise in a another location for the other environment
[21:47:10] <Dus10> rawtaz: yeah, he is good, but he isn't "architect" level, in my view
[21:47:27] <kwilczynski> Whooo? :)
[21:47:31] <Dus10> I don't need him going off making major architecture decisions on an island
[21:48:00] <rawtaz> Dus10: remind me, did you want people who are in a specific area (if so which?) or do they just need to be american citizens?
[21:48:01] <Dus10> if he can prove himself in that way, then that can come with time... and it wouldn't even take much time...
[21:48:09] <Dus10> He could probably prove it to me in 1-2 months
[21:48:15] <Edgan> Dus10: One of the things I have come to realize is that kind of like physics theory of everything theories, if you want to have a high level of consistency and automation you have to build a model where all the pieces fit together. The problem is there are many different models that are self-consistent, but people have different things they care about. Which leads to different models. Also this stuff is also constantly changing. So you build a 
[21:48:15] <Edgan> model to day, and it is at least somewhat outdated tomorrow.
[21:48:30] <Dus10> lantech19446: yes, he is VERY confident in himself and has no problem letting people know that
[21:48:31] <rawtaz> Dus10: yeah so basically just tone it down a bit, stop impressing us and show us what you can do with the actual work instead of talking
[21:48:41] <Dus10> there is a time and place for that sort of behavior, like on IRC :)
[21:48:44] <Edgan> Dus10: One example is I don't trust terraform enough to run it from a pipeline. It always needs supervision IMHO.
[21:49:01] <rawtaz> speaking of needing supervision.. has anyone seen kwilczynski today?
[21:49:11] <Dus10> there isn't even an opportunity for other folks to express an opinion
[21:49:16] <lantech19446> rawtaz: he just commented a few seconds ago
[21:49:33] <rawtaz> lantech19446: damn! what a sharp set of eyes you have there! ;-)
[21:49:37] <lantech19446> Dus10: I see why that could be a problem, not much good to you in a team effort if he thinks he's the whole team
[21:49:37] <rawtaz> i totally missed that
[21:49:55] <kwilczynski> LOL
[21:50:01] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: Very funny!
[21:50:22] <rawtaz> Dus10: i would have a talk with him where i explain that this is how he's coming across, making sure that he understands this isnt a useful way of communicating, but at the same time making it clear that it's not about anyone questioning him.
[21:50:26] <lantech19446> sometimes I think I'm on the spectrum because I miss peoples sense of humor really easily
[21:52:59] <rawtaz> boring!
[21:53:16] <Dus10> rawtaz: american residents with actual skills doing IaC in pipelines
[21:53:38] <kwilczynski> ?

[21:55:02] <Dus10> my wife tells me that I am on the spectrum, lantech19446
