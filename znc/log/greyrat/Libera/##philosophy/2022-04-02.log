[03:42:20] <causative> the ultimate test of any way of thinking is whether that way of thinking yields effective, practical results that promote its own existence in the long run.
[03:43:08] <causative> we are engaged in a sort of evolution of ways of thinking; successful ways of thinking are those that survive and make an impact, unsuccessful ones vanish without consequence
[03:43:26] <mycroftiv> aye, thats why there are always metalevels of testing your testing process, and all the iterations and variations as it proceeds
[03:44:14] <causative> I was thinking about interpretations of QM
[03:44:39] <mycroftiv> this is what W.H. Zurek writes about a lot
[03:44:52] <causative> which is right?  ultimately what matters is whether one particular interpretation of QM yields practical results and a practical advantage over some other interpretation of QM
[03:45:08] <causative> "Consider what effects, that might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object."
[03:45:20] <mycroftiv> quantum information darwinism explains why information preserving and replicating is favored in the space of observations
[03:46:05] <mycroftiv> you observe a collection of consistent information which has to repeat its pattern over time
[03:47:05] <mycroftiv> however there is - i believe - a topological structure of higher dimensionality in the larger landscape of theories which vary the tuning of our particular constants

[05:08:41] <Ungwelian> Indeed there is. Many of those, really.
[05:08:49] <Ungwelian> For example, social psychology charts some of it.
[05:09:29] <Ungwelian> Then you have anthropology, particularly environmental anthropology.
[05:09:49] <mycroftiv> theres a problem of how you successfully filter signal
[05:10:05] <Ungwelian> Takes study :)
[05:10:09] <mycroftiv> i have a problem with over-optimism that im being protected from harmfulness
[05:10:39] <mycroftiv> polarized sunglasses - peril sensitive like Adams
[05:11:08] <Ungwelian> There's no harm in studying social psychology or environmental anthropology. Well, as long as you get enough food, water and other basic necessities.
[05:12:41] <mycroftiv> its figuring out proper proactive protection from cognitohazards and - for me - how i code information clusters. i think of a color continuum where things warm to strawberry color (with a bit of moon) and thats just right, cherry is not lucky at all, deep aversion
[05:13:09] <mycroftiv> autumn oranges and browns are gorgeous too
[05:13:47] <Ungwelian> Yeah, I like those too. Warm colours :)
[05:15:09] <mycroftiv> i have strong mental identification with Charlie Brown from actually teaching myself to read from those books, so early formation of narrative and identification in chrono age makes growth process go differently imo
[05:16:15] <mycroftiv> the droning mwah-mwah-mwah voices of teachers who dont realize you know what they are teaching better than they do, and impose discipline to protect ego from youthful exuberance which does need tempering, but not from defensive placece
[05:17:28] <mycroftiv> of course the plight and status of teachers in the society i grew up is another of those karmic wheel situations where they are the last group of people i would want to disparage because the harder a task you take and the harder you try, the more the stress leaks can blow up
[05:18:24] <mycroftiv> i recall an elementary school teacher who screeched at us quite painfully and vanished halfway through a semester with mental issues of her own - the 'no talking' masks were a threat shed make that i dont think she carried out

[21:45:08] <blkshp> If you have an issue with someone potentially using your nick, add enforce onto your nickserv account but accusing someone without any evidence is not a great idea.
[21:49:35] <dispersed> identity theft is a serious crime though
[21:50:34] <dispersed> bittersweetsymph: how have you recovered from the bush fires last year?
[21:50:44] <dispersed> or was it two years ago
[21:50:44] <blkshp> Unless they've actually said "I am the same person that you have talked to before" then it's not even anywhere near it. An unused nick at the time being used when/if there is no protection on it is neither a crime nor an actual issue.

[22:01:39] <bittersweetsymph> Well I said he stated it to me and I didn't know if it was true or not
[22:01:44] <bittersweetsymph> So I am not accusing
[22:01:54] <bittersweetsymph> But they made up I took and sold cocaine
[22:01:57] <bittersweetsymph> So...
