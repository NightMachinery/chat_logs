[03:15:37] <Betawolf> "But Rasputin truly did not care at all about what people thought of him. He would pick his nose and eat it in front of dignified people, and mock aristocratic women for their airs.  He became good friends with Princess Milica and Anastasia of Montenegro, who were nicknamed ‚ÄúThe Crow Sisters‚Äù because of the shape of their noses. They were not Russian, but they still managed to marry into the 
[03:15:43] <Betawolf> Romanov family. They had actually both been heavily involved in mysticism and the occult, and they both manipulated their way into marrying members of the royal family. They were often treated as outcasts by the rest of the aristocracy, so they bonded with Rasputin, and took him under their wing. " and he honours them still.

[07:59:26] <gwern> quanticle: $5 these days is toilet paper. a good chicago economist can pull in up to a mil easy consulting. *that* is why it's there, because they are rationally ignoring the waste of time in looking for $5 on the ground. $20, maybe you'd have a case, but $5?
[08:02:45] <quanticle> An economist sure
[08:02:51] <quanticle> But there are plenty of grad students too
[08:03:05] <gwern> they have a future as economist to hurry to!
[08:03:09] <quanticle> And you're not going to be able to get away with claiming that $5 is a waste of a grad student's time
[08:03:27] <quanticle> Yeah, but think about it: with $5 that's a coffee, which can speed up their day's work!
[08:03:33] <quanticle> It's a rational pick-up
[08:03:35] <gwern> and with interest rates ~0%, their discount rates will be near that too, obviously
[08:04:00] <gwern> there are cheaper caffeine sources. I'm sure they all have big jars of caffeine pills like I do

[13:48:17] <adiabatic> HOW TO USE. Which Woody Allen movie had the father saying, "Don't ask me, I can't even figure out how a can opener works?" This is the answer to that quandary. With a little practice you'll be able to open a can nearly as fast as an electric can opener (specially if the power is out!). All you do is pound it into the can until the sharp part punctures the lid as close to the rim as possible, press it in so it starts separating the lid 
[13:48:17] <adiabatic> from the welded seam, then jack it up and down with all your might, turning the can below it until you rip around the entire circumference. Then you peel the lid back -- being careful not to slice open your fingers, thumb, or wrist -- and do whatever you intended to do with the contents. Is it easy to use? No. But it WORKS, unlike the cheap kind at the 99 cent store, and most of the fancy kind you buy at the upscale kitchen boutiques. 
[13:48:17] <adiabatic> Unlike the electric variety, it even works during a power outage, just as can openers used to do all the way back to Napoleon's time.

[13:53:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> It has taken two months to find the courage to write this review. First, I used this thing once. That's it, just one use and torque was too much from my weak hand. It broke. Metal on plastic construction is a huge no, no. So it sat on my counter top for a month just slapping me in the face with its awfulness. I was able to get other cans open in the interim the old fashion way (hammer). My cat has now been missing for a month,
[13:53:29] <Obormot\Arcturus>  it may very well be due to the sadness she sensed off myself over month pondering as to why such a terrible products are made, the environmental impact on goods that should only be purchased once in a lifetime. I can see why the Russians think Americans are inferior. Kitchen Aide, you have lost a customer for life (I only planned on purchasing from you once, you know the whole 1 time purchase thing, but now I can't recommend

I feel anxious as tomorrown my kids will return to daycare and school, and we will roll dice with the disease. latest vaccination will be 10 days, and disease is maybe heading down, but there are still many cases in daycare and school. but presumably it will not improve much from this for some weeks or months, and we now have full vaccination coverage each, so this seems to proper time to do it. still, worried how next week will fare.

[19:37:23] <rmmh> one of the axes of autism is aggression 
[19:38:06] <feep> yeah, to reiterate my point, I saw on a youtube channel that the animals that are the most aggressive and vicious tend to have really shitty eyesight
[19:38:22] <feep> to the extent of not being able to make out if a nearby animal is a predator or a herbivore
[19:38:35] <feep> which is why they have to take everything as a potential attack 
[19:38:42] <feep> this has obvious analogy to autism
[19:38:44] <PapuaHardyNet> lol, put shawwn and nshepperd in a room and you'll see how polite he'll be, even if he will constantly complain and make requests to nshepperd about things he wish she did
[19:39:40] <feep> if you can't predict how people will react to you, you have to get really socially aggressive so that it's ultra legible that people can't attack you

[20:56:34] <SDr> gwern re the Scientific Approach to Entrepreneurial Decision Making  paper, I'm currently in search for good startup idea / cofounder duo, and this is a very frequent thing I'm thinking about
[20:57:26] <SDr> and fundamentally, one of the things that happen in real life, is that entrepreneurs are building two things: the business where the product/market question is at core; and a team to execute on where the opportunity shinyness is the thing the startup is competing on
[20:57:59] <SDr> which makes gaslighting an adaptive behavior not just for self-blinding purposes, but more importantly to have a team to execute with in the first place
[21:00:35] <gwern> applying a bit more science and reason doesn't seem to stop dumbo's magic feather from working tho

[21:04:12] <SDr> yeah, it sorta does. Suppose there's an idea which looks & sounds articulate, and great. Then you apply the surface-y  measurements as in the whitepaper, like, asking friends whether they'd buy it etc. You get shiny stats. so you recruit peeps, and show them your shiny stats.  Now there's a branch.  in group 1, the team executes, and does X; at
[21:04:12] <SDr> some point maybe the lie comes out? but at that point sunken cost fallacy keeps the group together for some time.   In branch 2, someone on the team performs a more scientific measurement style, which shows that it's actually _much less shinier_ of an idea (predicting the failure group#1 came across _months_ later). at that point, every other team
[21:04:12] <SDr> member is at a choice of whether to pursue this less-shiny thing, or.... another thing which is, again, more shiny from surfacey proxies

[23:02:16] <ggreer> ^^ because they couldn't change the standard for lens sizes without pissing of a bunch of photographers
[23:02:24] <ggreer> mirrorless cameras are much smaller form factor
[23:06:12] <kiboneu> i thought that it's ergonomics and camera manufacturers having decades to get it right

[23:11:14] <Robomot> Dorothy Bishop (@deevybee): "Interesting. I did a little analysis on US $ spent on research on this topic for a talk I did last year, using data from NIH reporter. just a quick and dirty analysis, but wanted to show how jumping on bad stuff is an ethical requirement to prevent waste of scarce funds" (http://n.hyperborea.cloud/pic/media%2FFK7fsQxXwAYvhCb.png)
[23:11:57] <ggreer> no. nikon & canon have the same lens mounts as they did 50-60 years ago: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_F-mount
[23:11:58] <Robomot> Nikon F-mount - Wikipedia (The Nikon F-mount is a type of interchangeable lens mount developed by Nikon for its 35mm format single-lens reflex cameras. The F-mount was first introduced on the Nikon F camera in 1959, and features a three-lug bayonet mount with a 44 mm throat and a flange to focal plane distance of 46.5 mm. The company continues, with the 2020 D6 model, to use variations of the same lens mount ‚Ä¶)

[23:11:59] <Robomot> Canon FD lens mount - Wikipedia (The Canon FD lens mount is a physical standard for connecting a photographic lens to a 35mm single-lens reflex camera body. The standard was developed by Canon of Japan and was introduced in March 1971 with the Canon F-1 camera. It served as the Canon SLR interchangeable lens mounting system until the 1987 introduction of the Canon EOS series cameras, which use the newer EF lens ‚Ä¶)
[23:13:33] <ggreer> they were originally designed for 35mm film and reused for digital cameras. lenses designed specifically for digital cameras are significantly smaller, though most people just use phones now
[23:33:52] <ggreer> my only gripe about the iphone SE's camera is that it sucks in low light. my gf uses the iphone x and it doesn't have night mode, but it still takes decent photos at night
