[00:41:39] <greenbagels> ProfSimm: in the papers i'd say no, but there are plenty of languages that are commonly used for scientific / numerical programming kinda stuff, and that's where my earlier comment still applies
[00:41:59] <isekaijin> greenbagels: Fancy ways to pass parameters in programming languages are a really bad feature, though. All you need is functions of one argument, which can be a tuple or record, possibly with default values for its fields.
[00:42:37] <greenbagels> isekaijin: but you can still do that with optional named parameters, just as syntactic sugar

[00:43:29] <ProfSimm> greenbagels: I was wondering what happens in a paper when you have to track a function with 20 arguments
[00:43:49] <isekaijin> You group the arguments. That's what tuples and records are for.

[00:44:41] <ProfSimm> isekaijin: it's hard to come up with examples, but then in practice it just happens in complex code
[00:44:48] <greenbagels> ProfSimm: even in computer science domains, functions with 20 independent parameters is not really common

[00:49:18] <isekaijin> mycroftiv: Programming languages struggle with quotients. For example, a correctly implemented set ADT backed by self-balancing search trees is an example of a quotient type (trees modulo rebalancing).

[00:51:30] <ski> greenbagels : yea .. but allowing structured attributes would make sense, in some circumstances, imho. (even though i understand the kind of misuse that the 1NF atomicity was attempting to discourage from)

[03:54:29] <isekaijin> Gustavo6046: It isn't clear what you mean. Perhaps you could give an example?
[03:55:41] <Gustavo6046> isekaijin, like is it possible to define a value, where you can compare ordinally without necessarily being able to define equality?
[03:56:02] <isekaijin> Define a value?
[03:56:10] <Gustavo6046> it's like how you can check for the equality between two strings of characters, but there is no single way to compare them ordinally (e.g. length, alphabetical order, etc)
[03:56:15] <Gustavo6046> yes, like define a class of values
[03:56:56] <isekaijin> I'm sorry, it's still very unclear to me what you exactly mean.
[03:59:51] <isekaijin> If you have a completely arbitrary set, it makes sense in general to ask if two elements are equal, but not necessarily if one element is greater than another.
[04:00:12] <isekaijin> Unless that set is equipped with an order.

[07:46:09] <isekaijin> But, when you take the square root, well, it could have either sign.
[07:46:15] *** Joins: niston (~gridrun@user/niston)
[07:46:20] <isekaijin> So how do you determine the correct sign?
[07:46:24] <isekaijin> Or maybe both signs work?
[07:46:39] <|smlckz|> you're talking about the plus minus from the sqare root?
[07:47:00] <|smlckz|> *square
[07:47:01] <isekaijin> Yes.
[07:47:21] <isekaijin> You have to find the correct sign.
[07:47:39] <isekaijin> And the key is the following equation:
[07:47:50] <isekaijin> x + ap / sqrt(1 + p^2) = 0
[07:48:08] <isekaijin> This means that “x” has the opposite sign of “ap / sqrt(1 + p^2)”.
[07:49:39] <|smlckz|> hmm
[07:49:56] <isekaijin> In any case, 1 + p^2 = a^2 / (a^2 - x^2).
[07:53:32] <isekaijin> I'm an idiot. The answer to this sign problem is very easy.
[07:53:40] <isekaijin> sqrt(a^2 - x^2) is positive anyway.
[07:54:13] <isekaijin> Similarly, sqrt(1 + p^2) is positive anyway.
[07:54:29] <isekaijin> We want x and ap to have opposite signs.
[07:55:22] <Decker> it's always real but could still be negative
[07:55:26] <isekaijin> So, if a >= 0, we want x and p to have opposite signs.
[07:55:38] <isekaijin> And if a <= 0, we want x and p to have the same sign.
[07:56:01] <isekaijin> So the sign in front of p simply depends on the sign of a.

[08:41:42] <isekaijin> tusko: Now I see. Hermitian symmetric functions could arise as Fourier transforms of real-valued signals. But then the natural name for the variable of a Hermitian symmetric function would be \omega rather than t.
[08:42:09] <isekaijin> Anyhow, enough mathematics. Gacha time.
[08:43:20] <tusko> whats that
[08:44:12] <isekaijin> What's what? Fourier transforms?

[16:12:57] <clemenza> Like, can I throw the mod 35 on the other side and it becomes something else? Any pointers towards a direction would be appreciated. :-)
[16:13:49] <riv> clemenza: Do you know eulers totient function?
[16:14:51] <clemenza> riv, I understand it superficially. Continuously subtracting but in programming you can use mod.
[16:15:05] <riv> so eulers totient may be useful because for all x we have x^phi(35) = 1 (mod 35)
[16:15:08] <riv> phi(35) = 24
[16:15:10] <clemenza> (I coded a little RSA algorithm to help me understand what is happening)
[16:15:15] <riv> so x^24 = 1 (mod 35)
[16:16:05] <clemenza> (ok, let me try to follow please riv. one sec)
[16:16:08] <riv> The idea would have been to raise both sides of the equation 15^r=p^{5r} mod 35 by some r that gives you p^{5r} = p

[16:23:32] <riv> so to summarize
[16:23:54] <riv> We are working mod 35, so it's useful to calculate eulers totient phi(35) = 24

[16:39:25] <algebwarf> hey everyone, i'm trying to calculate the fundamental group of the orientable surface with genus 2, but I don't really know how to proceed with van-Kampen
[16:39:43] <clemenza> Frankly, I don't get how you can even raise everything to the power of 5. I understand it as just getting a larger "15" but everything stays the same.
[16:39:48] <cherim> But here assuming p=15^r with r=5 we get p=15^5 =27 mod 36, while 27^5 = 27 mod 36 and not 15. Scroll up, riv
[16:40:02] <riv> added to /ignore
[16:40:11] <clemenza> I really didn't have any math background before this so I was literally looking up what are co-primes.

[16:42:39] <cherim> It's mod 35 everywhere, 15^5 =27 mod 35, and  27^5 = 27 mod 35

[16:45:53] <clemenza> Ok, riv could you kindly let me know what p is? Maybe if I know what it's supposed to be, it will make sense?
[16:46:39] <clemenza> I understood as far as 759375 = p^25 mod 35 (raise to the power of 5)
[16:47:02] <riv> ok
[16:47:06] <riv> but both sides can be simplified down
[16:47:19] <riv> the LHS can be reduced to a number < 35
[16:47:27] <riv> and the RHS can be simplified to p
[16:47:31] <riv> so this gives you p
[16:48:03] <clemenza> < 35 but not 15?
[16:48:46] <riv> not sure what you mean. I'm just saying that 759375 can be reduced mod 35

[16:55:07] <riv> no, I never knew it would be 15
[16:55:15] <clemenza> Ok ok.
[16:55:42] <riv> it wont always come out as the same number as it started with - that's just a coincidence in this case
[16:56:04] <clemenza> Now, the 5 that you got before (raise by 5); it can't possibly be arrived by brute force (e.g., does 1 work? 2?)
[16:56:37] <riv> yes that is carefully chosen to let us make use of eulers totient
[16:56:50] <riv> so as I said we started with 15 = p^5 (mod 35)
[16:57:05] <riv> and we can raise both sides to some power r, to get 15^r = p^(5r) (mod 35)
[16:57:35] <riv> and to apply eulers totient theorem (which says x^25 = x (mod 35)) we need to get 5r = 25
[16:57:40] <clemenza> is it.. um.. the thing where you try to find a number x so that ((n * x) + 1) / e
[16:57:52] <clemenza> and x gives you a whole number?

[21:06:45] <cheater> riv: that doesn't matter. there are random noise sequences of binary values too.

[21:39:56] <Pollion> cadmio: is it ok ?

[22:11:51] <bonky> for context, f⁽⁴⁾ = g*g*ψ is involved in conditions for a nice theorem, and i can also assume a priori that f is a pdf, and it would be great to be able to say that the condition implies that Var(f) > 2Var(g)

[22:14:56] <dude12312414> The argument is just, given g(y1) = g(y2), pick some x1 in X, define f1(x1) = y1 and f2(x1) = y2, and define f1(x) = f2(x) = y1 for any other x in X (if any)

[22:15:47] <dude12312414> If gf1 = gf2 implies f1 = f2 for any f1, f2 in Y^X, then g is injective.

[23:10:09] <dude12312414> i guess one thing you can do is factor P(X) over Q(beta). If Q(alpha) = Q(beta) then P will split into linear factors
[23:11:37] <dude12312414> and if Q(alpha) n Q(beta) = Q then P will be irreducible over Q(beta)

[23:39:05] <Pollion> If their degrees are relatively prime, then it is easy
