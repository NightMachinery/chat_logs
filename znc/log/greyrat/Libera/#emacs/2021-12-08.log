[00:00:54] <bremner> yes
[00:01:00] <johnjay> someone explained how the versioning worked but i didn't get it.
[00:01:06] <johnjay> ok so 28 has its own stable branch right
[00:01:12] <bremner> afaik yes
[00:01:17] <johnjay> ok
[00:01:25] <johnjay> someone in a channel is asking help for "emacs 29"
[00:01:35] <johnjay> and current stable isn't even 28

[00:21:04] <hodapp> ugggggh this research paper spends 25 pages proving their results are correct and appears to devote 0 words to answering the question, "exactly which method did you use to get your fucking results"
[00:22:15] <hodapp> particularly, they are approximating something with a kernel and they walk through 15-20 different ways to approximate, and explain why some of them don't work
[00:22:30] *** Joins: phantomics (~phantomic@97-118-135-6.hlrn.qwest.net)
[00:22:43] <johnjay> hodapp: that can be a trickier question than it appears. though it is valid
[00:22:56] <johnjay> like most textbooks dont' really "explain" why the sum of the first n integers is n(n+1)/2
[00:23:19] <johnjay> they just use it to demonstrate how induction on integers works

[00:23:38] <bremner> Well, depends on the level of formality you demand, I guess
[00:23:55] <johnjay> it's not about formality. it's more like. they just use it as an example to prove how induction works
[00:24:06] *** Joins: Pickchea (~private@user/pickchea)
[00:24:12] <hodapp> johnjay: but I'm not asking why, just how; the question has a specific answer, and they even give a hand-wavy answer of which kernel they use in spots
[00:24:19] <bremner> oh I like the 19th century proof: write the numbers twice, sum the columns
[00:24:20] <hodapp> but the problem is that that answer is rather vague
[00:24:24] <johnjay> as opposed to saying something like 1 + 2 + 3... + n  added to n + n-1 + n-2 + ... + 2 + 1 gives you (n+1)n
[00:24:34] <bremner> yeah that
[00:24:45] <johnjay> that's more of a "why" answer yes
[00:24:55] <johnjay> the induction answer is more like, if you already came up with it how do you prove it
[00:25:32] <johnjay> hodapp: well you said they are explaining why some dont' work. maybe they just picked one of the other ones?
[00:25:40] <hodapp> johnjay: https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14794 is the paper, to be more specific; sections 2.1-2.3 are supposed to explain the "how"
[00:27:06] <hodapp> I am already a bit stuck at section 2.3, equation 5, because (1) what the fuck is 'g'? and (2) what is with the comma-separated expressions listed herein? are they parameters to a function? is this building a vector?

[02:17:07] <YoungPotato> Hi all! When I run xdg-open on a docx file in the terminal it uses libreoffice to open the file (which is what I want). Mime correctly links docx to libreoffice. When I press enter on a docx file in dired, it uses docview (which is great too). However, when I press enter on a docx attachment in mu4e it uses calibre to open the doc file, which is not what I want at all. How can I configure mu4e to open attachments with certain programs?

[06:39:51] <excalamus> in the standalone instance, there are blink timers
[06:40:07] <dale> excalamus: I would turn on blink-cursor-mode in the daemon version. :)
[06:41:01] <excalamus> so this is expected behavior?
[06:42:20] <excalamus> seems odd that I'd need to maintain different init settings depending on whether I started as a client or not. The solution is simple, but unexpectedly necessary

As I said, my Emacs has the new GUI frame's blink-cursor-mode set to t, but it wasn't blinking right off.  I had to unfocus and re-focus the frame to get it to start the timer and start blinking.  That's not your problem, as I understand it.

[06:58:20] <dale> excalamus: Seems like 11 months ago a change was made that might lead to the behavior you're seeing: https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/commit/deb90c893d3a0094db77753d8a795716784bbc7e#diff-706a7d4c3c45309bcf259c78259c0b615d6e1d3534d038e816cc6afd2e118dc5L2641

[06:59:36] <dale> Indeed, on my system, a daemon Emacs has (display-blink-cursor-p) -> nil at startup, so if I was running older Emacs, it wouldn't turn on blink-cursor-mode when started as a daemon.

[07:17:27] <s-liao> The reason I test it is that bot eval the above expression is "".
[07:18:47] <s-liao> But I tried a web service in my site, it can get the "U0003" string in json file in network
[07:18:47] <bpalmer> s-liao: you mean rudybot evaled that expression to be "" ? That will en dup being a control c character, and it's likely that bots will filter what they send to irc to avoid problems.
[07:19:20] <bpalmer> s-liao: that said, rudybot is not written in and does not speak elisp; rudybot is written in racket (a scheme).
[07:20:44] <s-liao> judybot can eval expression. rudybot can not
[07:20:45] <judybot> s-liao: , but its fine if you dont mind hard-coding the parameter. or you can write init to the equivalent function.

[15:46:15] <FrostyX> wasamasa: have you tried using eyebrowse when running Emacs in daemon mode?
[15:46:31] <wasamasa> I use both daemon mode and regular mode
[15:47:51] <FrostyX> I am not sure if I understand it correctly, but the eyebrowse workspaces are tied to emacsclient frame instead of the daemon instance? I.e. closing an emacsclient will destroy all its eyebrowse workspaces?
[15:48:28] <wasamasa> yup
[15:48:46] <wasamasa> the workspaces are per frame and don't disturb each other
[15:49:05] <FrostyX> I want them to disturb each other so much :D

[15:56:00] <FrostyX> I understand, thats a bit of a complicaction. But my use-case is totally different.

[15:56:32] <FrostyX> This way, I close an emacsclient frame and I am screwed

[21:11:37] <lampilelo> hyperbole seems nifty, it's a way of linking documents together with buttons, kinda like org-roam, i think? also there's a lot unrelated functionality to it, a menu system similar to hydra that lets you rearrange windows, change font size and a bunch of other crap, and an act button that does stuff based on the context, it's a bit much so swallow at once
[21:11:45] <lampilelo> i always wonder why it's a singular package
[21:11:55] <natrys> afaik hyperbole can be used *with* org-mode, it defines many kind of "buttons" that does things depending on context, so I think embark is more analogous than org-mode

[22:07:14] <jkordani> Hey everyone.  Trying to get past the elpa key change.  I'm running 27.2.  When I choose to allow connecting to elpa for just the session and refresh contents, the gnu-elpa-keyring-update package does not appear to be available to be installed
[22:07:41] <jkordani> I'd rather not install it manually as it looks like the idea is that you install it through the package manager and from now on as it is kept up to date this problem won't happen again, is that right?

[23:52:39] <ShinyRice> hey, I noticed mashing backspace results in reaaaaally stuttery and slow erasing of characters, and the profiler revealed that "command-execute" was at fault -- however that tells me nothing about the package slowing this down
