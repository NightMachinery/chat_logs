[19:21:59] <Evolver> If ML has opened the door for tokomak fusion via the continuous tuning of magnetic fields, then it should also open the door for antimatter containment because it too needs strong magnetic fields that might benefit from continuous tuning.

[20:51:56] <spaceseller> even with this toy example I got sometimes

[21:00:28] <spaceseller> Document_ID, Account_ID, Credit_binary, Debit_binary, value_$
[21:01:06] <Evolver> Are the two binaries just opposites?
[21:01:12] <Evolver> Can they be a single binary?
[21:01:17] *** Joins: georgios (~georgios@user/georgios)
[21:01:22] <spaceseller> negative
[21:01:37] <spaceseller> sometimes can be both positive
[21:02:39] <Evolver> which would effectively be the same as having two rows
[21:03:00] <Evolver> Maybe you can alternatively use a time series predictor for each account_ID. I don't know how well it'll work.
[21:04:29] <spaceseller> value is not the must need column.
