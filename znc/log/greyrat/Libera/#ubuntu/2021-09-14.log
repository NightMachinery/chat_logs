[00:00:13] <sarnold> Chucara: you could try a snap remove microk8s and see if that puts things back the way they were
[00:01:52] <Chucara> sarnold: Unfortunately, that didn't seem to do the trick. I'm not exactly good at reading the iptables output, but I guess I could start deleting stuff until it works. But not knowing what I'm doing makes me concerned I'll make it worse.
[00:02:14] <sarnold> Chucara: yeah, that's my usual feeling with iptables stuff :(
[00:02:29] <sarnold> Chucara: maybe remove and a reboot and hope the 'existing' rules do the trick?
[00:02:46] <mei> backup your iptables and try to just clean them and restart docker
[00:02:54] <xv8> Chucara: make backup of iptables config prior to edits
[00:03:33] <Chucara> See. That is the kind of sensible advice I wish I had gotten before I started mucking about with microk8s :'D

[02:25:59] <blahboybaz> I'm experienceing a few symptoms; that, I'm not sure are related or not? And, there's one specific thing from among them that I want to be sure to address no matter what..  Lately my system started acting up --> [1]: While browsing the web the sound on videos will stop working after a period of time (after a few videos or so), [2]: The video part of videos will freeze (with sound or without depending
[02:26:05] <blahboybaz> whether the sound has stopped prior to that or not) - but moving the mouse will make the video start moving again. [3]: When typing into any field (url bar for example) the characters will not be displayed even after a good bit of typing but moving the mouse will make everything that was typed up to that point appear or by hitting the enter key what has been typed will appear then immediately be
[02:26:11] <blahboybaz> submitted.  I have checked memory usage ( $ free -m ) and it appeard to be fine - only a couple mb of swap in use and more than half of total memory still availabe / unused. And I have checked my internet connection ( while sometimes as slow as a few mbits / sec Dand occasionally as fast as 30 or 35 mbits / sec  it would not account for all of the anomalies I'm seeing ). Something I did a few days
[02:26:17] <blahboybaz> after the problems started was to upgrade ( $ sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade ) my system. I noticed that some proprietary ( nvidia ) drivers were being held back so I intentionally installed those. During the installation process I was prompted to create a passworkd for something related to UIFI ( could that have been MOT ?? - I don't recall ). There were some instructions given during that
[02:26:25] <blahboybaz> process and I may have missed something. When I rebooted after the upgrades I was prompted to "continue booting" or, something like, register the ( MOT ?? ), the thing I had created the password for. I chose "continue booting" and Im not sure that was the right choice. Is that other option ( to register the thing in bios ) something I need to still do?
[02:26:40] <blahboybaz> I was trying to copy that out and put it in a paste but hit the enter key by acciden - appologies

[10:21:31] <Guest38> hi all im installing ubuntu 20.04.3 arm on an rpi via vmware esxi and my disk is a usb flash drive so the install is going quite slow. its been about 2-3 hours now and im wondering if it should be done by now? is there any way i can check from ssh to "query" the progress of the install? its just stuck at "acquiring and extracting image from
[10:21:31] <Guest38> cp:////media/filesystem" where its been for hours now... the "/" is still spinning around so i know its not frozen
[10:22:03] <Guest38> but i do have a ssh session up and wondering if theres anything that can be done to check for specific dirs or files as an indicator of progress/completion or simply that it is still making progress?
[10:22:24] <Guest38> perhaps check df every 30 minutes or so to make sure disk space is being filled?

[10:29:56] <helplessnoob> I can access the data if I mount it and I can copy files across... I want to save the trouble of doing that by fixing the boot.. Its a config issue that I messed up

[18:52:09] <ASC__> Minimal installation of Ubuntu. It can be Network Manager too. Does it changes an answer?
[18:52:24] <ASC__> Minimal install = deboostrap and so on.
[18:53:45] <alkisg> A plain debootstrap doesn't have network-manager, so that answer won't work. If you do install nm later on, on top of that, then sure it'll work

[19:11:25] <ASC__> rob: Most probably partitions are on their places. There is bootloader in first aprox 440 bytes of storage. I believe it's Grub now. Win distro bootable media have tools to put back their bootloader and all desired partitions flags. All in all it should have proper bootloader and proper partitions flags. Also EFI partition should be Ok. Partition flags are complex question. They can be restored manually too using Parted. But there are special tools, however
[19:11:25] <ASC__> they will disable Grub and Linux tooling.
