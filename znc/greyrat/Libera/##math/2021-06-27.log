[06:18:43] <ddevault> my question is the following: how long would the Dutch population have to store their farts for in order to have sufficient fuel to use them to launch the Netherlands itself into low Earth orbit
[06:18:55] <ddevault> (settling an argument)
[06:19:49] <ddevault> the netherlands occupies about 8.14×10^-5 of the earth's surface, and let's say down to 1 meter of soil
[06:20:45] <buster> the tyranny of the rocket equation is not on the dutchman's side in this case
[06:21:09] <ddevault> no, it really isn't
[06:21:21] <ddevault> but, it simplifies the math anyway if we assume half of the farts will be converted to antifarts and we can use an antimatter drive
[06:21:37] <ddevault> if we do that, the average fart contains 5.9956×10^12 joules of energy

[06:25:32] <tusko> wat
[06:25:34] <Nickssen> as a spherical sector or a linealized model?
[06:25:35] <ddevault> that puts the mass of the netherlands at 3.29×10^37 kg
[06:25:49] <ddevault> as a fraction of the earth's volume
[06:25:53] <ddevault> times the earth's mass
[06:25:59] <ddevault> which is probably wrong, since it's not of uniform density
[06:26:01] <ddevault> hm
[06:26:34] <ddevault> well, we can use it to establish an upper bound, anyway
[06:27:05] <Nickssen> you need to consider the huge amount of concrete used to prevent flooding
[06:27:18] <ddevault> well, we will be lifting the netherlands out of the ocean, so it shouldn't be an issue for them anymore

[06:30:32] <ddevault> mniip: the thing about orbit is that you have to go sideways too
[06:31:11] <mniip> that's solvable

[06:36:00] <PlanckWalk> 10 km/s seems extremely low for an antimatter rocket
[06:36:27] <PlanckWalk> In theory they go go to about 100 000 km/s
[06:36:44] <ddevault> I'm erring on the side of caution and assuming that we lack, say, an engine bell which can support the full energy potential of an antimatter explosion
[06:36:47] <tusko> wtf is an anti-matter rocket? srs
[06:37:03] <ddevault> the SI is assumed to be 1000-2000s for typical antimatter rockets

[06:37:20] <ddevault> magnetic confinement?
[06:37:21] <PlanckWalk> (in more than femtogram amounts)
[06:37:38] <ddevault> easy, just use the energy from the antimatter explosion to power the magnetic field to contain the other antimatter /s
[06:38:33] <PlanckWalk> tusko: Using the energy from antimatter annihilating with normal matter to propel a rocket
[06:39:15] <buster> a bit like a fission-fragment rocket, except not possible

[06:40:45] <tusko> modern physics scare me
[06:41:06] <ddevault> I reckon we'd need 3.67 * 10^17 kg of half farts, half antifarts to put the netherlands in orbit
[06:41:16] <ddevault> now, how much do people fart
[06:41:23] <ddevault> times the dutch population size
[06:41:51] <ddevault> ecs says 382ml per 12 hours
[06:42:51] <PlanckWalk> I think your figures are on the order of 1000x too large, but eh it's your fiction.
[06:42:58] <ecs> er, misread abstract, it's per day
[06:43:07] <ddevault> that's why I came here for help, PlanckWalk
[06:43:21] <ecs> and i definitely did not do my due diligence in researching this
[06:43:32] <ddevault> and you called my earlier figures 1000x too small?
[06:44:17] <PlanckWalk> Your Isp, yes
[06:44:33] <ddevault> I think we can safely estimate farts at about a gram per person per day
[06:44:35] <PlanckWalk> Which results in an antimatter mass requirement that is 1000x too large.
[06:44:43] <ddevault> PlanckWalk: ah
[06:46:12] <PlanckWalk> Even at 10 Mm/s, 99.9% of the energy is being wasted.
[06:46:14] <ddevault> so the netherlands produces 1.7*10^3 kg/day of fart
[06:46:15] <HisShadow> doesn't matter-antimatter reaction emit bunch of useless crap
[06:47:09] <ddevault> so, by my math, 10^14 years, and by PlanckWalk's, 10^10
[06:47:31] <ddevault> but north of that if using a combustion engine
[06:47:42] <PlanckWalk> 10^14 days, no?
[06:47:48] <ddevault> er, yeah
[06:48:11] <PlanckWalk> And yes, way more if using chemical propulsion.
[06:48:23] <ddevault> or just shy of 300 billion years, using PlanckWalk's figures for an optimal antimatter engine
[06:48:36] <PlanckWalk> My figures were way short of optimal
[06:48:52] <ddevault> well, more optimal, at least
[06:49:22] <ddevault> in any case, the netherlands will no longer be there on that time scale, so no point in investing in fart collection tech
[06:49:54] <buster> does that mean you win or lose the argument?
[06:49:58] <Nickssen> what if we feed them beans

[06:52:02] <PlanckWalk> Nickssen: What constraints are there on the equation?
[06:52:27] <Nickssen> None, just y(x) = c_1 .... is a solution
[06:52:35] <Nickssen> I have to say what the original diffeq is
[06:52:52] <PlanckWalk> Given previous question I guess it has to be a differential equation with x as the independent variable and c_1 and c_2 as arbitrary coefficients

[11:25:39] <Fangs> Really dumb question but how would you generate all partitioning of a certain integer?
[11:26:11] <riv> you mean like for 4, 4, 1+3, 1+1+2, 2+2 etc
[11:26:18] <Fangs> Yeah
[11:26:38] <Fangs> This feels like something you’d be able to do with nested loop comprehension in haskell
[11:26:45] <Fangs> (And efficiently too)
[11:26:51] <riv> well you can do this recursively, the partitions of n would be 1 + partitions of (n-1) & 2 + partitions of (n-2), ..
[11:27:44] <riv> if you just want to count them, you can use a recurrence relation that computes it more efficiently
[11:27:50] <riv> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_function_(number_theory)#Recurrence_relations
[11:28:33] <riv> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagonal_number_theorem oh yeah if you hadn't see this, pentagonal numbers theorem is key here
[11:28:38] <Fangs> I need the partition too
[11:29:12] <Fangs> I forgot all about that riv those things are fun
[11:29:37] <PlanckWalk> Yes, if you need the partition list then recursion is really easy
[11:29:59] <riv> > let p 0 = [[]] ; p n = do s <- [1..n] ; fmap (s:) (p (n - s)) in p 5
[11:30:23] <PlanckWalk> The details will depend upon things like whether you count 1+3 to be a different partition from 3+1
[11:30:27] <riv> oh wait this is bad
[11:30:35] <riv> this igves [1,2] and [2,1]
[11:31:12] <Fangs> PlanckWalk: I think “concretely” that amounts to choosing your numbers to be strictly increasing or starts from 1 every time
[11:31:18] <riv> > let p l 0 = [[]] ; p l n = do s <- [l..n] ; fmap (s:) (p s (n - s)) in p 1 5
[11:32:52] <PlanckWalk> I was considering caching but it probably doesn't help much here.
[11:33:09] <riv> it would help (a lot) with the recurrence relation for counting them
[11:33:13] <PlanckWalk> True
[11:34:14] <PlanckWalk> Anyway, it's not going to be practical to list all the partitions of many numbers.
[11:35:19] <Fangs> I have c1,...,cn and each variable are going to have degree |cj| = 2j
[11:35:31] <PlanckWalk> It's roughly e^O(sqrt(n))
[11:36:11] <Fangs> So In the cohomology ring, if you want to work with a non-ring hom your best bet is to work with things as if they’re Z-modules
[11:36:34] <Fangs> PlanckWalk: so it’s kinda expected *all* the degree i basis would have a lot of terms
[11:37:08] <Fangs> If my map had been a ring home we can work with just the generators c1,...,cn but it’s not
[11:37:15] <Fangs> *hom
[11:37:56] <Fangs> I think practically people don’t care about all the other elements of too high of a degree anyway cause there’s flat out too many of them
[11:39:27] <riv> you can generate restricted paritions directly
[11:39:47] <riv> use a upper limit parameter instead of a lower limit parameter like I did
[11:40:02] <Fangs> Lemme write a pseudo code...

[11:46:02] <Fangs> Something like this should work right?
[11:46:25] <Fangs> I decided trying to write it in Haskell-like syntax to be too cumbersome
[11:46:38] <riv> its way shorter in haskell
[11:47:00] <riv> can you do u : list instead of list ++ [u]?
[11:47:21] <Fangs> Probably, it’s hand written riv
[11:47:29] <Fangs> (Laptop charger died)
[11:47:42] <riv> think about it this way
[11:47:56] <riv> you want to write a function "partitions n l" which paritions the number n into parts <= l
[11:48:37] <riv> so get a base case written down and then assume the function exists for all n < m, and implement it for m using those as helper functions
[11:49:33] <riv> you can put a condition on the parameters that you always have l <= n
[11:49:51] <Fangs> The numbers in the partitions are <= I or that there are <= I pieces?
[11:50:50] <int-e> riv: I'd recommend let p m 0 = [[]]; p m n = do s <- [1..min n m]; (s:) <$> p s (n-s) in p 5 5 ---it's different in that the [l..n] part never produces an empty list, which can waste quite a bit of effort
[11:50:58] <riv> so the parts you want to subtract are [1..l].  do part <- [1..l] ; let n' = n - part ; use recursion here now   partitions part n'  and join 'part' onto the start

[13:38:16] <eyepeetee> hi, if i have a hypothetical dataset consisting of x and y values, and i want to graph this... but the distribution of those y values has most of its values lets say between 100 and 1000, but has a few instances of values above 10000,
[13:38:19] <eyepeetee> how can i meaningfully graph this such that granularity in the values between 100 and 1000 is evident, but the high values are still represented? on for example a line chart or scatter plot..
[13:38:35] <Koen_> log scale
[13:39:12] <eyepeetee> Koen_: i considered this but wont i lose detail in the smaller values?
[13:39:31] *** Joins: int-e (~noone@int-e.eu)
[13:39:32] <Koen_> not necessarily
[13:39:39] <Koen_> you'll see the details differently
[13:39:59] <Koen_> also it works particularly well if your values are really between 100 and 1000, as opposed to between 0 and 1000
[13:40:47] <eyepeetee> okay, i will give this a try. the actual values i'm playing with are much larger...there will be no 0 values but certainly some low ones
[13:41:19] <Koen_> hmm
[13:42:03] <eyepeetee> but i'll give it a try right now and see how it looks, thank you :)

[13:42:19] <Koen_> in linear scale, graphing values from 0 to 1000 instead of from 100 to 1000 would force you to scale down to 90%

[22:46:36] <Z-module> that reminds me, loopspace, I think you'll find this hilarous.  A very long time ago, I was in a large "Stop & Shop" supermarket (a big chain in my region) once, back a long time ago when they were trying to be a lot more than just a food market. They had a somewhat eclectic section of actual books, at the time. To my extreme astonishment, they had several piles (all together about 40 copies) of Nathan Jacobson's "Algebra II" (first
[22:46:36] <Z-module> edition), at 3 US dollars each. These were in new hardcover condition, and I *imagine* the silly corporate buyer there must have thought these would be suitable for school children (hahaha). So I bought 5 and later sold 4 of them at enormous mark-up!
[22:47:50] <greenbagels> lmao Z-module
[22:47:55] <loopspace> Hah, I love when that sort of thing happens. When friends come over, they sometimes wonder at all the books on my shelf simply titled "Algebra"

[22:48:26] <Z-module> I was just really said they had no Algebra I.
[22:48:31] <Z-module> sad*

[23:02:37] <biberao> so
[23:03:22] <biberao> when do we take the intercept between 2 curves
[23:03:29] <biberao> just to find the zeroes?
[23:04:55] <greenbagels> biberao: you find the intersection of two curves usually as its own goal
[23:05:15] <greenbagels> like you find the intersection just to find the intersection; your ultimate goal depends on what kind of curves they are and how it fits into a bigger problem

[23:08:17] *** Quits: dyeplexer (~dyeplexer@user/dyeplexer) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:08:23] <greenbagels> so yeah, finding the intersection of f(x)=g(x) is the same thing as finding the zeroes of f(x)-g(x)
[23:08:41] <greenbagels> because f(x)=g(x) <=> f(x)-g(x)=0
[23:09:01] <greenbagels> so any point of intersection of f and g corresponds to a zero of f-g and vice versa
[23:09:08] <biberao> so i can consider 16 to be its own line?
[23:09:10] <biberao> or something
[23:09:49] <greenbagels> sure
[23:10:50] <biberao> cool
[23:11:05] <biberao> any other tips you can give me

[23:11:51] <greenbagels> biberao: you should probably just focus on trying to get multiple different (but equivalent) ways to look at the problem
[23:12:22] <greenbagels> so for example, you said you can consider y=16 to be one line, and y=...ln and whatnot to be another curve, so you're looking at the intersection
[23:12:49] <greenbagels> if you graphically visualize that, and then shift everything down by 16, then you're looking at y=0, and y=...ln whatever... - 16
[23:13:33] <greenbagels> the x coordinates for the intersection points are now the same, but you are now essentially just looking for the zeroes of this modified function, like i pointed out earlier

[23:14:10] <greenbagels> and t he y coordinates for the intersections will be 16 below what they were before
[23:14:56] <biberao> i did the -16 yes and the x are the same
[23:15:14] <biberao> so basically its like you said earlier
[23:15:20] <greenbagels> yea

[23:15:20] <biberao> so its a y transformation then
[23:15:50] <greenbagels> being able to think about it both geometrically (in terms of graphs) and algebraically (in terms of manipulating the equation f(x)=g(x)) is a handy skill to develop
[23:16:13] <biberao> thats my problem

[23:17:38] <biberao> greenbagels: any other things i should take into account?
[23:18:26] <greenbagels> well with the chain rule you can call as many things functions as you want (for example, every function f(x) could just be 1 * (1 * (1 * ... (1 * x)...)), but those repeated chain rules will just give you the identity over and over

[23:22:23] <biberao> any type of function?

[23:24:11] <biberao> the function became |x|*|-ln(x+e^2)+2|=16 because it was the area of a triangle
[23:24:32] <cokernel_hacker> Hi. Arc tangent is sometimes given as a two argument function atan2(y,x) for real y and x to disambiguate the quadrant. I am also aware of atan(z) defined for complex arguments. I ran across Mathematica's definition of atan2(zy, zx): -i*log((x+i*y)/sqrt(x^2+y^2)). I can't seem to find out more about this function, it does not show up in NIST's database or other sources that I've checked. Do folks have any pointers on why this
[23:24:32] <cokernel_hacker> definition is a logical choice for atan2(zy, zx)?
[23:24:34] <biberao> 8 was the area so since |x|*|-ln(x+e^2)+2| were the sides divided by 2
