[20:28:43] <Kilroy> sorry if this is the wrong channel for this, but I can't figure out how to download a video where the only link I got for it was a magnet:?xt=urn:btih: and when I try to open it up in firefox it googles something about bittorrent?
[20:29:27] <Kilroy> so I did some poking around and I found that rtorrent and I am running that but it keeps on sitting at 0
[21:45:12] <TheSHADOW> Yes, you need a bittorrent client to donwload a magnet link.
[21:45:22] <TheSHADOW> I recommend qbittorrent.
