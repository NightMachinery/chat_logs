[05:01:59] <FromGitter> <WallyYang> Hi there, has anyone hit a issue with yasnippet not able to jump out during a completion and instead expand a snippet? looks like https://imgur.com/a/vGr6IyU, and when I removed the yas keybinding it went to completion-at-point instead: https://imgur.com/a/zDxW3mr. This is from a fresh spacemacs install with auto-completion and language layer

[16:31:56] <FromGitter> <rodrigogribeiro> Hello all! I'm a newbie on spacemacs and I'm trying to configure org-mode and org-super-agenda. When I try to get the todo list using org-todo-list, I get the error message: Invalid function: (date date).  Any clues on how to solve it?
[16:53:16] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> @rodrigogribeiro Can you do `M-x toggle-debug-on-error`, and tell us which function cuases that error?
[16:54:06] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> So try using org-todo-list again after doing this step to trigger the error

[17:54:43] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> @rodrigogribeiro Thanks, however I had already found that from the link from the mail-archive I sent in my last message.
[17:55:35] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> So reading that thread, it looks like it is a subtle bug in org-mode
[18:00:37] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> So one thing I would try is if it disappears when you load org on startup. You could try by pressing `SPC h d f` then type `org/init-org RET` then press `o` to jump to the source. Within that function you could comment out the `    :defer (spacemacs/defer)` line (puttin two `;` in front of it). Then restart emacs and see if it helps...
[18:04:13] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Or actually you might have better results when doing this in `org/init-org-agenda`
[18:05:39] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> (i.e. comment out `:defer t`)
[18:36:00] <FromGitter> <kassick> do you even have py27 installed by pyenv?
[18:37:12] <FromGitter> <kassick> I'd think that your PATH does not point to pyenv's bin, so instead of executing pyenv's python shim (that will execute the desired py version), your shell is calling the python in /usr/bin or /bin ...
[18:37:46] <FromGitter> <kassick> if that's the case, try adjusting the PATH in spacemacs env file (SPC e e)
