[10:09:41] <Cryowolf> If it continues to be like this, I'll enjoy it
[10:10:01] <Cryowolf> not everything needs to be battle or dark detective stuff or mysterious death games
[10:10:26] <ButterNoodle> yes pls send the cute everyday stuffs
[10:10:36] <Cryowolf> I do enjoy slice of life but I was so tired of the high school setting, so this felt very new
[10:10:36] <ButterNoodle> idk what was the last epic sol...
[10:10:51] <Cryowolf> only 2 episodes of it are out, I saw the first one so far
[10:11:05] <Cryowolf> it's on subsplease
[10:11:55] <Cryowolf> high school setting for slice of life feels a but unimaginative to me, but when I saw this being set in the early 1900s and such it made me curious

[10:13:22] <Cryowolf> maybe there's more cute stuff I can find, if I do I'll let you know ButterNoodle, if you find some slice of life stuff that isn't set in high school and such and is maybe a bit unique. Let me know too yeah?

[10:15:46] <JesseDesu> butternoodle did you know there was a rocket powered version of the F-104 starfighter that was meant as a test bed for reaction control thrusters on the X-15
[10:16:23] <ButterNoodle> nope.. all I know is the x15 is damn fast
[10:16:36] <JesseDesu> well now you know
[10:16:53] <JesseDesu> it was also depicted in the end of the 1983 movie The Right Stuff
[10:17:02] <Cryowolf> JesseDesu, it's set in 1912 or something where if a man couldn't prsue a career or have the money to raise a family, he was useless and secretly discarded or whatnot by the family. If it was a rich one especially
[10:17:37] <ButterNoodle> I mean thats kinda like knowing that horse vaginas and cinnamon crunch bagels from panera bread look the same
[10:17:39] <Cryowolf> So since he can't tend to himself and they dont want to spend money on him, they call in a debt and force a debter to sell their daughter as a wife to their son
[10:18:09] <Cryowolf> but they end up actually liking each other
[10:18:22] <JesseDesu> i have so much useless knowledge about military aircraft
[10:18:23] <ButterNoodle> its unnecessary information, however its interesting
[10:18:47] <Cryowolf> and you have to see it slightly through the lense of the era
[10:18:51] <ButterNoodle> JesseDesu: did you know that parrot tongues and horse penises look alike too?
[10:19:07] <Cryowolf> nowadays buying a bride would be seen as slavery, back then, not so much :P
[10:19:17] <ButterNoodle> fax Cryowolf
[10:19:34] <ButterNoodle> but even today.. you pay for it, just over time
[10:19:40] <ButterNoodle> as they suck the life from you
[10:19:57] <Cryowolf> ButterNoodle, I certainly didn't know that. Does this mean parrots mimic speech with a horse penis and if so...could a horse penis mimic human speech?
[10:20:00] <JesseDesu> butternoodle the key to life is to earn more money
[10:20:12] <ButterNoodle> Cryowolf: yes
[10:20:28] <ButterNoodle> horse cocks in mouths are the key to mastering linguistics
[10:20:30] <Cryowolf> This information has changed my life
[10:20:45] <ButterNoodle> JesseDesu: how much
[10:20:50] <Cryowolf> and reminded me of something disgusting
[10:20:52] <ButterNoodle> u know what they say
[10:20:56] <JesseDesu> depends where you live
[10:20:58] <ButterNoodle> the more you make the more they take
[10:21:13] <JesseDesu> the bigger they are the harder they fall
[10:21:30] <Cryowolf> there's this parasite that attaches itself to fishes or water animals tongues and eat away the tongue to replace it and "take over its role"
[10:21:42] <ButterNoodle> average income in my town is 45K a year... idk how thats possible
[10:21:59] <Cryowolf> while simultaneously taking some of the food the fish etc feeds on
[10:22:16] <Cryowolf> I dunno if they can leave the mouth or not though
[10:22:22] <ButterNoodle> I read about that Cryowolf.. thats strange
[10:22:25] <JesseDesu> butternoodle what skills should i develop
[10:22:52] <Cryowolf> ButterNoodlem the animal world has some creepy shit going on
[10:23:04] <ButterNoodle> *dark
[10:23:20] <ButterNoodle> JesseDesu: idk
[10:23:43] <ButterNoodle> Ive never been good at job advise or match making
[10:24:06] <JesseDesu> i want to earn more money
[10:24:42] <Cryowolf> I need a manga artist(/illustrator for aone-off book or something, I'mt not sure how much illustrations a LN has though
[10:24:57] <ButterNoodle> I just need a cute girl
[10:25:07] <ButterNoodle> someone to make life great again
[10:25:24] <JesseDesu> i have 4 harddrives connected to a 90 watt 16 port usb 3.0 hub https://www.dropbox.com/s/tytfxs5a9aydx5j/IMG_20211014_030930.jpg?dl=0

[10:26:03] <ButterNoodle> I was gonna buy one of those hubs
[10:26:09] <JesseDesu> its like $77
[10:26:11] <JesseDesu> made in china
[10:26:15] <ButterNoodle> yup
[10:26:16] <JesseDesu> working good so far
[10:26:17] <Cryowolf> and since I can't afford to pay a manga artist, it would need to be a collaborationof sorts. My skill set is in the creativity in the the story telling etc.
[10:28:16] <Cryowolf> but serious question here, how much artwork does an illustration contain, on average? A dark fantasy one, sure there will be battkes but most of it focuses on character interaction and growth
[10:28:51] <Cryowolf> is it like every other page on average?
[10:29:36] <JesseDesu> depends on the artist
[10:29:45] <JesseDesu> and how high they are on drugs
[10:30:08] <Cryowolf> lol
[10:30:33] <Cryowolf> well, doesn't the producer and story teller decide on it ultimately?
[10:30:38] <Cryowolf> and editor
[10:31:09] <JesseDesu> i mean, think of a similar question
[10:31:20] <JesseDesu> how many tracks are laid on a piece of music
[10:31:25] <JesseDesu> on average
[10:31:43] <Cryowolf> I haven't bought physical media in awhile
[10:32:36] <JesseDesu> sometimes theres overworked pieces of art
[10:32:51] <JesseDesu> where the background doesnt match the character
[10:33:27] <Cryowolf> I can probably do ok background art where I'll get better by time
[10:33:28] <JesseDesu> some people are efficient at making plain backgrounds that imply a lot of detail
[10:33:59] <JesseDesu> there are certain tricks for faking detail
[10:34:05] <JesseDesu> shadows and crosshatching
[10:34:22] <Cryowolf> I know someone that might be interested in a colab to see if we can make it sell
[10:34:23] <JesseDesu> gaussian blur
[10:34:33] <Cryowolf> his style remindsd me a lot of the late Berserk mangaka
[10:35:48] <Cryowolf> and we're kind of acquainted so I can DM  him and talk to him about my story idea and such'
[10:37:13] <JesseDesu> people often dont follow through
[10:37:34] <JesseDesu> amigojapan had me draw from a photo once
[10:37:37] <JesseDesu> i still have it
[10:37:58] <Cryowolf> and how we can work together to get character styles working an how mangaka's ften getting attached to charactes might think "this person wouldnt do that" while I think it's a secret they hid and were capable of all along
[10:38:01] <Cryowolf> cool
[10:39:24] <JesseDesu> i dont draw anything for anyone except for notcorp projects
[10:39:47] <JesseDesu> money gets in the way
[10:40:02] <Cryowolf> well this guy is extreneky takented. I honestly don't know if he'd follow through
[10:40:12] <JesseDesu> it changes the status of certain friendships
[10:40:46] <JesseDesu> i used to draw for this friend i have
[10:40:48] <Cryowolf> and yeah the money is an issue, hence why I would suggest a colab and share in the money
[10:40:51] <JesseDesu> i dont like his ego tho

[10:44:22] <JesseDesu> when you work with real clients theres different models of payment
[10:44:39] <Cryowolf> uh no there's a lot of work to plan out each characters charater arc and growth and how that works with the same of another character as well as every little story arc between the characters. Then side stories, the main story, the lore of the world, how the world works. The law of the mechanics of say magic
[10:44:41] <JesseDesu> theres things like upfront fees, kill fees, late invoices

[10:46:36] <JesseDesu> one suggested model is an upfront fee, another at 33% progress, 66%, and 100%
[10:47:00] <Cryowolf> Sorry what? This isn't comission
[10:47:24] <JesseDesu> also any changes and edits are to be taken care of by the 50% progress point

[10:49:31] <JesseDesu> yea i'm listening
[10:49:55] <JesseDesu> you intend to make back pay
[10:50:11] <Cryowolf> I'm saying this is a colab, not a comission. Im not paying him to draw and he's not paying me to write, produce or edit. Neither of us would make a single cent unless it sells
[10:51:08] <Cryowolf> and it's not only the illustrator that goes on a loss there
[10:52:25] <JesseDesu> as with any business venture, there is a chance of losing money
[10:52:37] <Cryowolf> yep
[10:52:39] <JesseDesu> i've heard this scenario countless times
[10:53:11] <Cryowolf> this is all obvious, to me anyway'
[10:53:19] <JesseDesu> one guy does the story, one guy does the art, they hope it sells
[10:53:40] <JesseDesu> i've been approached a couple times on anime art discords
[10:53:47] <Cryowolf> the cooperation has to go beyond that
[10:53:54] <JesseDesu> i'm like flat out no
[10:54:13] <JesseDesu> sentionics tried to pitch an RPG game to me
[10:54:17] <Cryowolf> you have to work together on the art, to create the character together
[10:54:17] <JesseDesu> where i do the art
[10:55:06] <JesseDesu> i guess if you two believe in what your doing
[10:56:34] <Cryowolf> well I can't pay anyone, but in the end I don't really need an llustrator to tell my story
[10:56:48] <Cryowolf> all I need are my words and a ton of work
[10:57:36] <JesseDesu> if i were you i'd flesh out the story and design details as much as possible before you even approach an artist for a collab
[10:57:55] <amigojapan> ok now I am typing form my PC for the first time in a while
[10:58:09] <amigojapan> finally with an an SSD !!!
[10:58:10] <JesseDesu> show initiative and show something substantial before you get anyone onboard
[10:58:11] <Cryowolf> the issue is also how many artists dont want to be a "drawing monkey"
[10:58:36] <JesseDesu> cuz going back and forth on ideas is a pain in the ass
[10:58:42] <Cryowolf> meaning they want to be there in creating the story and characters

[10:59:53] <Cryowolf> I dunno how many illustrators would be willing to have zero story input etc
[11:00:55] <JesseDesu> if there is no direction they will just run with it
[11:00:57] <Cryowolf> Of course character design is a fully colaborative effort
[11:01:09] *** Quits: sikel_ (~sikel@user/sikel) (Quit: leaving)
[11:01:30] <Cryowolf> I would be involved in the art direction and scene direction
[11:01:43] <Cryowolf> but so would they
[11:01:55] <JesseDesu> some artists need to be micro managed, others want complete freedom
[11:02:29] <JesseDesu> theres a certain amount of threshold in the level of direction that most artists want
[11:03:01] <JesseDesu> they want both directions and freedom, not too much or too little of both
[11:03:08] <JesseDesu> theres a sweet spot
[11:04:06] <JesseDesu> imagine the artist is like some sort of ninja or navy seal
[11:04:30] <JesseDesu> if you give them the sweet spot they will succeed at the mission
[11:04:36] <Cryowolf> yeah,I can't give them 100% freedom and I don't have time to 100% micromanage
[11:05:14] <JesseDesu> there was a video about this concept on youtube
[11:05:18] <Cryowolf> at first we would need to work together on getting the design right and the more we come to understand each other and how each of us think, we can sync up and it takes less time
[11:05:19] <JesseDesu> i forget the title
[11:06:01] <JesseDesu> you also risk not being able to work with him
[11:06:26] <amigojapan> I wonder if I should upgrade this old laptop to its maximum specs, it would not be expensive but I probably should not waste money
[11:06:37] <amigojapan> it has only 4GB of ram
[11:06:44] <Cryowolf> JesseDesu, by co-operating, I risk not working?
[11:07:23] <JesseDesu> i gathered that you have never worked on a collab with this person
[11:07:49] <JesseDesu> so yes, you might find out you dont gel
[11:07:58] <Cryowolf> correct, things might fall apart
[11:08:30] <Cryowolf> but that wont have to do with the work strategy (necceserily)
[11:09:42] <Cryowolf> but those are obvious risks you take
[11:10:14] <Cryowolf> not like I' buying a character card in a JRPG
[11:10:27] <Cryowolf> and he does whatever I say as long as I dont do his "dislikes"

[15:15:09] <amigojapan> gotcha

[15:16:12] <amigojapan> ok
[15:16:22] <KatrinValerie> lastonestanding: because the physics is simpler
[15:16:26] <amigojapan> 3d is ugly

[15:16:44] <KatrinValerie> So it is going to be retro style
[15:16:46] <amigojapan> pixel art any day
[15:16:56] <amigojapan> over 3d
[15:17:08] <lastonestanding> 3d can be pixely too
[15:17:15] <lastonestanding> see Minecraft

[15:18:01] <KatrinValerie> My other GF can code in python and probably C, so I think pyglet is a good option
[15:18:10] <lastonestanding> the market is flooded with those indie 2d retro rpg games though
[15:18:31] <lastonestanding> won't you compete with them?
[15:18:34] <KatrinValerie> lastonestanding: so we should make a 3d one with voxels and raytracing and more buzzwords to stand out?
[15:18:46] <KatrinValerie> It is really just a demo for our portfolio
[15:18:58] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: if you want to amke one using voxels, I suggest you se 3dpl source
[15:19:00] <KatrinValerie> We are not expecting to make a comercially successful game really
[15:19:16] <lastonestanding> I just think that 3d can better showcast your talents
[15:19:27] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: I do things very hardware accallerated and I want to learn vulkan
[15:19:30] <lastonestanding> 2d often looks too generic
[15:19:51] <KatrinValerie> I think 3d is a lot more challanging and for a first project it might be too high of a hurdle.
[15:20:01] <KatrinValerie> Though I can see the appeal to it
[15:20:45] <Bco1981> KatrinValerie: i can't code, but using unity i managed to make a vr app, that loads a character and could use a controller to fly around.

[17:25:31] <Sadale> What a nice customer you are :3
[17:25:39] <amigojapan> hahaha
[17:25:58] <Sadale> amigojapan, A similar story happened to me. I ordered 10 tiny LCDs for my game console project. And the order number got mixed up by the shipping company.
[17:26:41] <Sadale> amigojapan, supposedly the 10 tiny LCDs should be rather lightweight. Like 100g or so. I ended up receiving a box of 4.7kg. Supposedly it contains a lot of tiny LCDs. I didn't opened the box tho.
[17:27:30] <amigojapan> Sadale: oh, yeah that sounds simillar
[17:27:39] <Sadale> amigojapan, I ended up contacting the seller in mainland China. Luckily they're located close to Hong Kong (China). They ended up arranging to send a person to here for taking the box back. And they're reshiping the tiny LCDs that I've ordered to me.
[17:28:14] <Sadale> Considered that they're willing to send someone crossing to border to enter here, I suspect that the LCDs inside probably worth quite a lot to them. xD

[17:54:18] <ImoutoBot> Bco1981: Space Adventure Cobra (TV Series, 31 episodes) | Finished airing | http://anidb.net/a1091 | http://myanimelist.net/anime/2451
[17:54:23] <darkwitch> Edens Zero, it has the same strong shounen smell
[17:54:42] <omero> oh some days ago... binged Astra Lost In space
[17:54:54] <Bco1981> i guess that last search isn't wrong... cobra's has tails
[17:55:03] <omero> I is soooo good. I loved it.
[17:55:29] <Bco1981> !a Edens Zero
[17:55:30] <ImoutoBot> Bco1981: Edens Zero (TV Series, 25 episodes) | Next episode: #14 (ETA: It's late) | http://anidb.net/a15597 | http://myanimelist.net/anime/42192
[17:55:37] <omero> and also binged Dr.STONE
[17:56:35] <Bco1981> oh, that's why the characters looked so similar... the same author.
[17:57:20] <omero> edens zero... never heard
[17:57:43] <Bco1981> omg. it litteraly is fairy tail in space.
[17:57:45] <darkwitch> as one reviewer says: This man has only ever told one story, but that story isn’t called Fairy Tail, it’s called Rave. Rave is a generic, hot-blooded shounen action series about a guy with spiky hair and a blonde bimbo with big tits who go on a magical adventure to fight evil with the power of friendship.
[17:57:52] <omero> but fairy tail (not the space one) is ... huge
[17:58:01] <Bco1981> if you look at the characters.
[17:58:02] <omero> will take me a while to catch up
[17:58:28] <omero> I dont mind... I like long running anime
[17:58:46] <omero> *cough* gundams *cough*
[18:00:02] <omero> fairy tail is not exactly my kind of genre... because I tend to avoid 'magical girls'
[18:00:03] <DunceCotus> an anime about saving rave? Yes please
[18:00:12] <Bco1981> ah... there is a witch in Edens Zero
[18:00:39] <darkwitch> they managed to make 51 episodes of Groove Adventure Rave before it turned into Fairy Tail
[18:00:40] <omero> my favorite witch ever? vanessa enoteca
[18:00:55] <omero> she's no girl...
[18:00:58] <Bco1981> Zetta
[18:02:16] <Bco1981> Izetta*
[18:04:56] <omero> that Izetta, Bco1981 ... is from the Edens Zero?
