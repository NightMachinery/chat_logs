[09:21:39] <Slade> ljharb, yea. i wanna convert the .env files or something to js. trying to hack around some under developed react-native expo stuff
[09:22:32] <Slade> it doesnt use .env files to populate process.env

[09:23:42] <Slade> unless there is a clean way to do this
[09:23:49] <ljharb> Slade: um, it's RN. you put in env vars with metro.
[09:23:56] <ljharb> there's no hack needed or advisable
[09:24:10] <Slade> metro?  i'm actually using expo not react-native

[12:11:10] <theskillwithin> Maxdamantus i speak english i know what you meant...
[12:11:14] <Maxdamantus> My main concern is the security implications.
[12:11:21] <Maxdamantus> But the bloat is also a secondary concern.
[12:11:30] <argument> Chromium security issues?
[12:11:56] <Maxdamantus> Discord and Slack should work just fine in a web browser. There should be no reason to be getting people to run native programs on their computers nowadays to use systems like that.
[12:12:24] *** Joins: kakashiA1 (~kakashi@188.111.42.10)
[12:12:47] <Maxdamantus> Having people run a native application for what *should* be (and practically is) a website just makes things less secure.
[12:13:07] <argument> The sad thing is, it is perfect for a side project of mine. I would like to be able to create a desktop app without thinking about what system the user has. But i'd also not want to use something that is on its way out
[12:13:14] <Maxdamantus> Because it's more native software that could be vulnerable to attacks, and more native software that needs to be updated when attacks are found.
[12:13:46] <theskillwithin> has slack ever had a srs attack?
[12:13:50] <Maxdamantus> and on desktop OSes, native software is normally not sandboxed sufficiently.
[12:14:04] <Maxdamantus> Yes, I think Slack has had at least one serious attack.
[12:14:18] <theskillwithin> what about VSCode
[12:14:29] <Maxdamantus> Dunno, never looked into VSCode.
[12:15:37] <theskillwithin> so if slack was just a website, it would have avoided those attacks?
[12:15:53] <Maxdamantus> Also, in general it is also vulnerable to attacks that pop up in Chrome, but people are probably going to update Chrome before updating all 10 of their Electron-based apps.
[12:15:56] <silly> that's not the point
[12:15:58] <Nitrousoxide> VS Code is generally more lightweight than most electron apps
[12:16:14] <Maxdamantus> Yes. I was not vulnerable to the Slack vulnerability because I was using Slack in a web browser.
[12:16:18] <Nitrousoxide> But it's still using 200mb of ram idle fright now
[12:16:20] <Nitrousoxide> right*

[12:41:24] <Nitrousoxide> their*
[12:43:12] <electrostatic> But basically all heap allocated data in rust is anchored to the stack frame that create it. And it can pass references into deeper stack frames through "borrowing"
[12:43:36] <electrostatic> And then when the stack frame that anchored it collapses, that memory is automaticlaly and instantly freed
[12:43:41] <Nitrousoxide> Man I'd really love to learn Rust one day

[12:44:13] <Maxdamantus> electrostatic: your description could also apply to JS.

[12:44:33] <Maxdamantus> The stack is basically the GC root in JS.
[12:44:35] <Nitrousoxide> I'll happily learn a new language if there is the necessity
[12:44:41] <theskillwithin> idk what id use it for, but rust is cool
[12:45:04] <electrostatic> Maxdamantus, not exactly, the things you are allowed to do in rust are VERY limited. There is not actual garbage collection
[12:45:33] <electrostatic> When the function you declare it in ends it ends. Period
[12:46:01] <electrostatic> And the compiler's main job is to complain about you trying to do things you can't
[12:46:18] <Maxdamantus> Same with in JS. Things become unreferenced when your function ends.
[12:46:35] <Maxdamantus> There are other cases where things become unreferenced, both in JS and in Rust.
[12:47:11] <electrostatic> But in js having something referenced keeps the function in scope
[12:47:20] <electrostatic> (closure returns, e.g.)
[12:47:52] <electrostatic> Rust doesn't work in that direction
[12:47:53] <Maxdamantus> You can conceptually do the same thing in Rust.
[12:48:02] <electrostatic> Although it is an interesting idea
[12:48:30] <Maxdamantus> I think you can actually move ownership of a
[12:48:35] <Maxdamantus> .. variable into a closure.
[12:49:08] <electrostatic> You can transfer ownership, I know that
[12:49:25] <electrostatic> but idk if you can do exactly that, interesting idea, though

[17:12:22] <bobdobbs> kind of offtopic, but you guys are programmers so... I just bought a new keyboard and after a few days it feels too hard on my hands. Exactly what qualities should I look for in a keyboard?
[17:12:39] <dreamreal> Apparently softer. What do you mean by "hard on your hands?"
[17:13:17] <bobdobbs> Like, it feels like the keys are just a little too hard to depress. For any given keypress it doesn't matter. But after a few hours I can feel discomfort in my fingers. It feels like I've been working my fingers to hard.
[17:15:16] <dreamreal> so you need softer resistance. Do you know what the switches are?
[17:15:25] <bobdobbs> switches?
[17:15:33] <dreamreal> yes, the springs under the key caps
[17:15:45] <bobdobbs> ah, ok
[17:15:57] <dreamreal> https://www.daskeyboard.com/blog/mechanical-keyboard-guide/#common-mechanical-keyboard-switches

[17:20:28] <silly> usually i type on a subnotebook keyboard, but i have a cherry stream kb in the drawer too
[17:21:19] <dreamreal> if mine broke I'd replace it with another one ASAP. It's quiet, tactile feel is good for me, has the full keypad, holds charge forever (always surprises me when I need to recharge it and that's QUICK)...
[17:22:11] <dreamreal> Really should get another two of these (one as a spare, one as the primary keyboard for my OTHER computer, which has the small wireless magic keyboard as a secondary)

[23:25:03] <wroathe> The further down the Webpack rabbit hole the JS community goes the more I find myself just wanting a cross platform node.js version of Make
[23:25:29] <wroathe> Gulp was that for a while, but the streams-based API was a bit awkward to use at times.
[23:25:45] <sheetjs> or just use make
[23:25:59] *** Quits: silly_ (~silly@user/silly) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)

[23:27:07] <wroathe> sheetjs: It's been a long time since I did anything on Windows, but my understanding is that it's still a pain to install it for Windows, and because being cross-platform is a requirement that basically means all of your make recipes will just delegate to node scripts
[23:28:03] <sheetjs> doesnt wsl ship with make?
[23:28:08] <wroathe> As Windows only has a small subset of unix commands offered via Powershell aliases
[23:28:17] <wroathe> No idea

[23:29:48] <wroathe> Still sounds like it's a pain, and the recipes themselves wouldn't be portable
[23:29:57] <wroathe> But I agree, Make is great.
[23:30:01] *** Quits: linguist (~brunodOut@170.84.57.174) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[23:30:36] <wroathe> I'm generally in favor of language specific portable Make clones (like Rake, Shake, and so on)

[23:31:24] <sheetjs> but yeah, we still use makefiles and that's unlikely to change anytime soon
[23:32:15] <wroathe> Well, I'm unlikely to be able to control whether or not Windows users work on this project I've got coming up

[23:33:25] <wroathe> systemfault: It's the state of the art right now, but I don't know if I'd say "best". I feel that past a certain point doing everything via declarative configuration becomes more of a pain in the ass than a help
[23:33:28] <GreenJello> I tried to move away from webpack to parcel 2, and it took a few hours to run into a roadblock that sent me back to webpack

[23:33:43] <wroathe> And at some point you just want to write imperative code to handle your tasks
[23:34:02] <sheetjs> there's also shelljs
[23:35:22] <wroathe> Especially when your build tasks get highly dynamic and configurable. You find yourself just writing lots of code to dynamically construct part of the webpack configuration object.
[23:38:01] <sheetjs> you can use multiple webpack configs
[23:39:27] <wroathe> sheetjs: Indeed. That's the simple case of having multiple static webpack configurations. Fact is, most mature build systems have far more configuration states than a few files would solve.
[23:39:49] <wroathe> You can simplify it somewhat by having base configurations, but even that only goes so far
