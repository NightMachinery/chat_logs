[01:48:19] <sapere_aude> So.. wtf. I've installed bleachbit and configured it to clean some cache and free disk space. I previewed the scan, and it estimated around 1G of free disk space. All good till here, except that my root partition was 13% full, and when I started the scan I saw it increasing to what is now: 22%, am I missing something here?

[02:31:21] <gianmarcogg03> hello i have an issue with xdotool where if i run something like xdotool key Super_L+a most of the time it works just fine but then it will sort of miss it and press instead "sa" as if it wanted to type those two letters, do you have any idea of what's causing this behavior and of how to fix it?

[02:34:54] <mpan> gianmarcogg03: xdotool has fat fingers ;). Seriously: do you use `xdotool key` or `xdotool kedown` + `xdotool keyup`? Try the latter.

[02:39:17] <mpan> Note that this may not be a problem with `xdotool`: I rather suspect some weirdness caused by how the target program processes keys combined with how fast the messages arrive. For example testing for modifier keys after receiving the message, at which point `xdotool` is no longer simulating the modifier key press.
[02:40:01] <mpan> So try sending keydown/keyup events at a rate that is expected for a human.

[04:15:12] <ente_> does anyone know how to make a keyring (for nextcloud-desktop to save credentials between restarts) like gnome-keyring work without a DE? I am running bspwm and can't seem to get it to work. I followed the wiki (https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GNOME/Keyring), added the PAM stuff then added the gnome-keyring-daemon --start to my bspwmrc and still the Login keyring is locked when I view it in
[04:15:15] <ente_> seahorse and I also can't seem to unlock it manually 
[04:16:05] <ente_> sadly, none of the applications seem to logg any errors in stdout so I can't even work with that.

[06:50:18] <lolok> you can try this at grub prompt, but i make no guarantee as i never tried it, if it works you can make it into a menu entry:

[19:00:21] <SysGhost> somewhere 5 connections seems to be the limit. It waries. Some mirrors accepts more, others not at all.
[19:00:40] <neko2> this is serially mind. the limit seems absurdly low.

[19:02:35] <SysGhost> neko2: in a way understandable. some mirrors get thousands upon thousands of connmections each andd every hour. They need to keep the concurrent connections down to be able to server more people.
[19:02:37] <neko2> susi_: I don't recall mentioning one, but I wrote my own. the base rsync calls are as advised by the archwiki. then it's just an outer script that does a foreach over enabled repos with the given rsync:// url in the config as a prefix.

[23:23:06] <deadpyxel> I did mostly what the wiki instructs about Bluetooth, and I checked that rfkill is not softlocking the device.
[23:23:26] <jayray> I think I will just leave iter-time at the defaults... I mean it takes 10-15 seconds to unlock vs 5 if I set iter-time to 1000 vs 1 second at 100... probably not worth the weaker hash.. any thoughts?
