[17:18:00] <xnaas> Snuupy: iOS app. 
[17:18:22] <xnaas> There's actually a plugin for ZNC so you can get push notifications, but I don't use ZNC.
[17:18:28] <xnaas> re: Palaver
[17:25:23] <fnutt> https://github.com/jreese/znc-push
[17:27:16] <xnaas> https://github.com/cocodelabs/znc-palaver
[17:27:36] <xnaas> I would assume the obvious advantage would be clicking the notification and actually being taken to context, but I've never used it so idk.
[17:27:55] <xnaas> I only use Palaver as a fallback to plan around thelounge not being able to handle network changes at all.
[17:28:07] <xnaas> and I don't use ZNC in any capacity any more :P

[18:15:29] <bookworm> xnaas: what do you mean by doesn't handle network changes? I frequently change from wifi to mobile+vpn and it works just fine
[18:15:48] <bookworm> you reconnect, sure but that doesn't matter much
[18:15:51] <xnaas> either the message I'm typing goes poof or I've hit send and it vanishes into the aether
[18:16:11] <bookworm> how does the draft go poof?
[18:16:16] <xnaas> I think the latter is worse, though.
[18:16:39] <xnaas> Nothing worse than hitting send and going "oh cool, the message is gone and nothing happened" ðŸ˜…
[18:16:39] <bookworm> my draft just stayed put when I reconnected
[18:16:47] <bookworm> that we can fix
[18:17:06] <xnaas> If I had an up arrow key on mobile...that might help? dunno tho
[18:17:14] <bookworm> or well, attempt to. Problem being that the server may modify our message
[18:18:28] <bookworm> but drafts are certainly unaffected by reconnection of the client for me, can you give me steps to reproduce?
[18:18:38] <xnaas> oh yeah, another fun one that's probably an iOS-specific issue
[18:19:05] <bookworm> well, safrai* not iOS per se
[18:19:14] <xnaas> is after the PWA has been opened, closed, and reconnected a bunch of times, the 'attach file' paperclip stops working until the PWA is cleared from recent apps/force closed
[18:19:24] <xnaas> I'm positive that's just Apple sucks ass on purpose, though.
[18:19:25] <xnaas> :P
[18:19:37] <bookworm> great ðŸ™ƒ
[18:19:48] <bookworm> don't buy apple crap, it helps
[18:19:56] <xnaas> You go to click it and it just closes the text input field instead lol
[18:21:44] <xnaas> My only other options are: a nearly unsable Linux phone, a 'dumb' phone, inserting Google's spiked cock all the way up my asshole, or GrapheneOS (with its own large set of issues, the biggest of which right now is just trying to buy a fuckin' Pixel 6 anywhere lol)
[18:22:19] <xnaas> I've de-googled my life, I'm not spreading my anus and saying "please sir may I have another" again
[18:22:40] <xnaas> (intentionally graphic language to get the point across)
[18:36:57] <Activ8> My apple crap works perfectly fine
[18:37:03] <Activ8> i donâ€™t have any issues
[18:37:22] <Activ8> but then again I donâ€™t suggest features lol
[18:38:08] <bookworm> it works if you stay in their walled garden, yes
