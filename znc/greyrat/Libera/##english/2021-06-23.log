[17:21:33] <tinwhiskers> It's not terrible, but have you considered client and provider?
[17:22:31] <tinwhiskers> That is, in context you might well get away with it, but it's a bit unusual.
[17:23:16] <tinwhiskers> or even patient, if it's for healthcare.
[17:23:38] <thojanssens> tinwhiskers, for now it's "Appointment provider" (doctor, assistant, teacher, ...) and "Attendee" (patient, student, ...). So the appointment provider is not part of the attendees. But it might work I think because sometimes attendees may mean those who attend minus the workers/organizers/...
[17:24:07] <thojanssens> tinwhiskers, client is too exclusive, it could be a sales representative, a partner, etc
[17:24:32] <tinwhiskers> well, as I say, it's unusual. Healthcare provider/doctor and patient/client would be better imo.
[17:25:04] <thojanssens> tinwhiskers, yeah but could also be a teacher and a student
[17:25:09] <tinwhiskers> Appointment provider sounds more like some software or the receptionist to me.
[17:25:20] <thojanssens> tinwhiskers, right
[17:26:44] <tinwhiskers> OK, yeah, for being that generic it's not too bad depending who or what you are talking about, but if you're talking about the person providing the service and their client, then service provider/client.
[17:27:18] <tinwhiskers> If you're talking about a software role then appointment provider seems ok.
[17:27:21] <thojanssens> tinwhiskers, yeah I'll not go for attendant cause it's going to be more confusing than anything else
[17:27:52] <tinwhiskers> ok. it's weird though.

[23:37:37] <kompowiec> i see that nobody answer on my question... so i have proposal: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0R--_ATzE6o
[23:37:41] <kompowiec> or convos.chat
[23:38:35] <pussipupu> I don't see your question, what was it?
[23:38:35] <blkshp> No.
[23:38:39] <blkshp> Just no.
[23:38:55] <pussipupu> Also, “I see that nobody has answered my question”
[23:39:47] <LuisM14> had no answer for it
[23:40:07] <LuisM14> not offering myself at the time
[23:40:55] <blkshp> What was the question?
[23:41:03] <kompowiec> No problem. I ask "anyone can recommend some voice chat?"
[23:41:10] <blkshp> Ah. No.
[23:41:21] <blkshp> Discord. But I don't recommend it just know it exists.
[23:41:51] <kompowiec> i used discord once. It sucks, voice chat just sucks
[23:42:01] <kompowiec> is bugged
[23:42:27] <blkshp> We don't really like voices, that's why were here!
[23:42:41] * LuisM14 gives him a '
[23:42:56] <blkshp> s/were/we're/
[23:42:57] <tinsoldier> b​lkshp meant: We don't really like voices, that's why we're here!
[23:42:58] <kompowiec> eg. at one point it disconnects me, but I don't know it happened because it happened technically.
[23:43:06] <pussipupu> The World Service is pretty good
[23:43:08] <pussipupu> And they chat with their voices a lot
[23:43:44] <kompowiec> so at one point I talk into the air. It also happened the other way around.
[23:43:59] <blkshp> From the Corporation of the British Broadcasta?
[23:44:14] <kompowiec> google says BBC
[23:44:52] <LuisM14> what did the air respond with? :D
[23:45:34] <pussipupu> From the Biased Broadcast Corporation, yes
[23:45:43] <pussipupu> Select the bias of your preference of course
[23:45:48] <kompowiec> in discord. It disconnects you because WebRTC stops working, but you don't know it, because you still appear connected to voice chat.
[23:46:08] <pussipupu> Discord just periodically crashes for me
[23:46:16] <pussipupu> I have to run it in a loop so it comes back
[23:46:16] <kompowiec> at least on skype i know about it when disconnect me

[23:47:00] <kompowiec> I don't know about other countries, but Skype is the most popular communicator for tutoring, also in English, in poland
[23:48:06] <kompowiec> sometimes there are people who suggest other communicators, but in most cases it ends in problems.
[23:48:37] <pussipupu> I know that here in Finland for the studying I was recently doing they made us use Teams
[23:49:01] <pussipupu> It was both worse and less bad than Discord
[23:49:48] <kompowiec> https://www.gnu.org/education/how-i-fought-to-graduate-without-using-non-free-software.html
[23:50:09] <kompowiec> I'm sorry, polo-centrism again
[23:50:22] <kompowiec> but still great inspiration.
[23:50:30] <pussipupu> I don't think it was, I think you were just speaking to your knowledge
[23:51:31] <pussipupu> honestly I'm more worried by the fact that I basically have to have an Android or iOS device than specific closed programmes I end up using
[23:51:49] <kompowiec> well, I've always wanted to try teams but for some reason he is not reserved to a wider audience.
[23:52:21] <kompowiec> in the sense it is reserved for employers and schools only. As a regular user, I am banned.

[23:53:06] <kompowiec> pussipupu: when i buy dumbphone, the only thing I missed, was QR.
[23:53:09] <pussipupu> Don't try then, also that's not a regex
[23:53:30] <pussipupu> I need my bank login to do government stuff, and need Android to go the bank ID

[23:54:34] <pussipupu> Well, it's pretty hard to get by without  one here in Finland I'd say
[23:54:58] <kompowiec> in my country isn't mandatory and if my family hadn't forced me, I would never have used it.
[23:55:19] <kompowiec> i always just use cash
[23:55:34] <pussipupu> I never use cash
[23:55:48] <kompowiec> well, i see you problem

[23:57:25] <LuisM14> don't need to use one here, but it's convenient
