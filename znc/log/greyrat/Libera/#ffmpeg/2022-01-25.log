[01:25:23] <kepstin> (x264 is a specific encoder implementation for the h264 video codec)
[01:26:25] <kepstin> AbleBacon: anyways, that probably means that you didn't seek to a keyframe, so it was missing some of the data needed to generate the frame you're on

[01:27:47] <AbleBacon> yeah, it is definitely seeking to an intermediate frame
[01:27:57] <AbleBacon> ok so that error is probably not what's causing my program to fail
[01:28:13] <AbleBacon> thanks
[01:29:55] <kepstin> most video players implement seeking by seeking to the closest keyframe before the desired point - ffmpeg has options to the seek function for that - then decoding and throwing out frames until they're at the desired timestamp.

[01:32:45] <AbleBacon> yeah--i'm using gstreamer and i'm telling it to seek to keyframes, but that doesn't seem to be working. really i think the seek itself is failing because the timestamp isn't moving, and because i'm having it flush the pipeline for the seek, it loses the keyframe info and shows the characteristic grey screen
[01:33:15] <AbleBacon> is there a good format to use for seeking within a "growing" or "streamable" file? i've tried matroska and mpeg-ts so far
[01:34:35] <kepstin> hmm. not really for seeking, since good seeking requires an index, and most formats can't write an index while writing.
[01:34:46] <kepstin> you could consider using a segmented streaming format like hls or dash
[01:35:18] *** Joins: vlm (~vlm@user/vlm)
[01:35:18] <AbleBacon> what if i'm not using HTTP and it's just local? like saving a live stream to file
[01:35:26] <kepstin> yeah, you can use those locally
[01:35:33] <AbleBacon> ok thanks
[01:36:13] <kepstin> (ffmpeg's muxers for segmented formats just create a bunch of files on the drive, and if the player's io is sufficiently generic it should be playable from the files without an http server)
[01:40:26] <AbleBacon> when you stream something (like a live press conference on a news site or something), and it lets you navigate back to any part of the video that you've already watched, what is that using? i'm assuming the navigation is happening in your local copy of the video, right?
[01:43:04] <BtbN> Usually HLS or DASH in event list mode
[01:43:24] <AbleBacon> thanks i'll research that

[01:45:10] <kepstin> live streaming can run in two basic modes - one where it only gives you info about the last few segments, and the other where it gives you info for all the segments back to the start of the stream.
[01:45:27] <kepstin> in the latter case, the player has enough info to seek back by loading up earlier segments
[01:46:43] <AbleBacon> yeah, the latter case is what i want

[18:17:03] <MzDay2> Hey, I was trying yesterday to generate a video from a sequence of images, and there was a prolbem with the colors across different media player relating to the color space (thanks JEEB!). Fast forward today, I tried following JEEB suggestion about using BT.709 but the problem remain:
[18:18:16] <MzDay2> JEEB suggested to match the metadata to the one I use but hadn't figure that out yet, I guess maybe its related to the AVCodecContext settings(?)
[18:19:09] <JEEB> yea the best you can do is match the stuff to your conversion params
[18:19:15] <JEEB> which is what we saw in the zimg example
[18:19:21] <MzDay2> I tried converting the frame I constructed into another (maybe proper) frame, using "sws_scale_frame" (is this the new frame based API?)
[18:19:23] <JEEB> where you took an sRGB PNG and converted just the matrix
[18:20:44] <MzDay2> I was trying to follow your suggestion about zimg but didn't find enough info for me to properly use it (so far)
[18:22:37] <JEEB> if you build FFmpeg against it you get the zscale filter
[18:23:10] <JEEB> but in either case, even with swscale it's the  same. zimg/zscale just give you more control
[18:23:33] <JEEB> since it's each H.273 parameter separately VS all at once under one umbrella
[18:23:36] <MzDay2> Yeah I figured that's the case, so I sticked with swscale for now
[18:25:33] <MzDay2> The odd thing is that when I use `color_trc` set to LINEAR I get different view, but when I use IEC61966_2_1, I get the same view, but not the right one (darkened, from the original, I guess maybe because I set the Color space in Unity to Linear)
[18:26:08] <JEEB> uhh
[18:26:14] <JEEB> check your input image :P
[18:26:41] <MzDay2> I did :\ I tried exporting it with ppm and the image seems fine
[18:27:08] <MzDay2> I even tried using swscale to convert from RGBA->RGB24->YUV420
[18:27:25] <MzDay2> (I thought, "maybe...")

[18:31:23] <MzDay2> Anyway I assume VLC see's the Linear flag and display the image correctly, but it seems MPC is applying some sort of gamma correction (again, I assume)

[18:38:02] *** Quits: Vonter (~Vonter@user/vonter) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[18:42:04] <JEEB> so your input is actually linear?
[18:42:16] <JEEB> that is why I said check your darn input image :D
[18:42:21] <JEEB> you should know the properties of it
[18:42:31] <JEEB> you said at one point previously that it was sRGB
[18:45:44] <MzDay2> My bad :\
[18:47:00] <JEEB> but yea, mpc-hc by default utilizes the windows EVR renderer
[18:47:29] <JEEB> I know that LAV Video would probably interpret the linear flag and pass it from the decoder to renderer
[18:47:35] <JEEB> but whether the renderer supports it is... up in the air
[18:47:49] <JEEB> I was surprised it actually supported BT.601|BT.709 flags back in the day
[18:48:55] <JEEB> but yea, if BT.709, BT.709 and linear transfer seem correct then swscale only did matrix since sRGB already consists of BT.709 primaries
[18:49:45] <MzDay2> Yeah it seems correct and I checked FFprobe and it is indeed with 709 and linear
[18:50:02] <MzDay2> So basically the mpc doesn't interpret the linear flag correctly?
[18:50:20] <JEEB> I wish it was as simple as that :P
[18:50:27] <JEEB> directshow is a series of components and pipes between them
[18:50:51] <MzDay2> Sounds fun
[18:50:52] <JEEB> you have a source (file reading f.ex.), then a demuxer (LAV Splitter I think in case of mpc-hc), then a decoder (LAV Video in case of mpc-hc most likely) and finally a renderer
[18:50:59] *** Joins: Vonter (~Vonter@user/vonter)
[18:51:08] <JEEB> my guess is that LAV Video does interpret the flag
[18:51:16] <JEEB> and maybe even passes it in the input pin
[18:51:32] <JEEB> but if the following component does not support it then welp
[18:52:52] <MzDay2> Okay and I assume that maybe sRGB will be supported? or something older maybe
[18:53:28] <JEEB> to see properties you can check play->filters->your renderer (generally EVR)->pin info
[18:53:36] <JEEB> that's the info that your renderer gets
[18:55:13] <JEEB> it either does no transfer function adjustment (in which case sRGB should just accidentally look correct), or treats everything like BT.1886

[19:15:10] <JEEB> playback-wise
[19:15:40] <JEEB> if vanilla mpc-hc is a requirement and the metadata seems legit (I wasn't able to double-check that), then you probably will have to do some adjustments
[19:15:54] <JEEB> legit as in the DXVA_ExtendedFormat stuff
[19:16:06] <MzDay2> Got it
[19:16:56] <MzDay2> So I'll probably need to find something older to construct the video, as the requirement is to run on old devices
[19:17:20] <JEEB> well, check those devices then? :D
[19:17:26] <MzDay2> I'll try it with madVR and see if it works, if it does, then I guess it confirm it
[19:17:56] <MzDay2> I can't actually test on them, they distrubute the videos across the world and there are many use cases but many are old devices not available to me

[19:19:06] <JEEB> then it probably isn't going to be 100% correct everywhere. BT.709 matrix/primaries + sRGB transfer is the one that I'd default to given your input is a game and most likely you can output sRGB from it
[19:19:21] <JEEB> if that gets through testing, then that's fine. if it doesn't, then you'll have to change the transfer

[19:26:21] <JEEB> stormfinger: software licensing wise your license depends on the configuration. if I recall correctly the mp3 reader and decoder are LGPL which is the default license, and if you don't touch enable-gpl or enable-version3 then your binaries will be LGPLv2.1+

[19:27:24] <JEEB> which effectively means that the user should have the power to build and replace that library if he/she would like to. thus the "distribute the exact source code for the LGPL component" and "make it a DLL/solib/shared library so it can be easily replaced if the user should really want to go that way"

[19:28:03] <stormfinger> shared library i understand and not to rename files stupidly ...
[19:28:05] <JEEB> the FFmpeg source code utilized is distributed, and the build is limited and the configuration is LGPL components only

[19:29:30] <stormfinger> if i say i want to use that file and that function how can it be replaced
[19:29:57] <JEEB> if you are linking shared library, the system dynamic linker will when running look up things according to the file name
[19:30:11] <JEEB> if you have a local build of your application, check `ldd your-app`
[19:30:20] <JEEB> that lists all the shared libraries that it will look at

[19:33:29] <JEEB> that's why you distribute the source code for the version of FFmpeg you utilized

[19:34:56] <stormfinger> i have no problem with that :) and i guess it valid use case :) ..but if he wants to use another library ..i then must predict that also ..
[19:36:08] <JEEB> yea, that seems to be the general idea of LGPL. you can utilize the library in an application given that the LGPL component can be replaced (thus the source code distribution requirement, and why people recommend you utilize shared libraries)
[19:36:19] <JEEB> I just tried to explain the "where it comes from"
[19:37:11] <JEEB> and of course you don't need to support people who randomly decide to try a newer or older FFmpeg. as long as technically if someone builds the same exact version, they can replace the shared library

[22:27:39] <Polochon_street> oh, seems like `avcodec_copy_context` disappeared between 4.0 and 5.0, is there any reason why? How should one do to clone a context?

[23:01:49] <JEEB> open it in the FFmpeg repo and then utilize the "changing lines matching" search
[23:02:01] <JEEB> on current master you will first find the commit that removed it finally
[23:02:07] <JEEB> then the next hit should be the one that deprecated it
