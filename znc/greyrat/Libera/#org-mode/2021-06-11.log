[01:14:53] <zebrag> Demosthenex: Well, I sure do not like the hierarchical system, like "file system". It is good for programming projects, for code, because it is used by the building tools. It is also good when you are in the process of note taking, because on the spur of the moment you can't do better, though you would do way better, and completely differently were you using old school sheets of paper, you would scribble, make arrows and circle everywhere, etc. It is also 
[01:14:55] <zebrag> good for the output, at the time you want to make some presentation, because otherwise, nobody will understand anything of what you're saying. But in the middle of the workflow, and I understand it is widespread way to do things nowadays, you use "tags" (tags, tags, tags) and "hyperlinks" (hyperlinks, hyperlinks). So, sending chunks of notes, that were originally taken using some hierarchical system, to send them to a sort of pile, which pile is a sequence of 
[01:14:56] <zebrag> chunks of notes, meant to be tagged and linked together. Well that makes sense to me. Anyway, if I send everything to the same place, and it is clear where the chunk starts and ends, well they shouldn't be lost. Also, the "uuid" :ID: thing, should point me to where they initially come from.
[01:17:15] <zebrag> And it has the additional feature to be straightforward. Sending everything to the same place, at the end of the file is, straightforward.
[01:17:49] <zebrag> And if notes are lost in that "pile", well, they were already lost to begin with.
[01:20:37] <zebrag> Tags, short tags, all on the heading line, though, do not seem powerful enough for it. Because you clearly can't put enough tags on the headline, and tags can't be descriptive enough. Because they have to remain short.

[01:25:22] <zebrag> "Scrap paper to solve math problems". That is such a powerful and beautiful way of taking notes. And you make a circle around a piece of information, and you make arrows, and if not possible you put a number next to it, which you will use as reference somewhere else in your scribbles.
[01:26:13] <zebrag> Classical, so very effective, way beyond any hierarchical organization of things.
[01:30:36] <zebrag> And usually, those notes, you crush them into a ball, and throw them to the nearest bin: That's a system.
[01:31:12] <zebrag> Only here you tag it before you place it in the bin.

[18:08:59] <Demosthenex> zebrag: sounds like you're describing a mindmap system
[18:09:06] <Demosthenex> and you have expectations from somewhere else
[18:09:43] <Demosthenex> i'm trying to say that org-mode is basically a hierarchical document mode, with some metadata functions and an export layer. much like a programming language, you can write what you want with it, but it doesn't give you a structure to follow
[18:12:37] <Demosthenex> you can put multiple tags on a headline, but they are simple single words w/o punct. you can create internal links to other headlines in and across documents if you like pretty easily
[18:12:54] <Demosthenex> you can collapse the tree and search with regexp, tags, partial words, etc
[18:13:43] <Demosthenex> i've also heard that between gnu hyperbole and zettlekasten you can do tiny org files and link them together, however that's not part of org. that's something someone wrote to sit on top. you should try to learn org first, before trying those
[18:14:17] <grym> hyperbole seems like it's got a shot at being useful, but it is also its own entire little universe 
[18:15:35] <Demosthenex> grym: it took me a while to really understand wtf it does... basically it's context sensitive hyperlink buttons across modes
[18:15:52] <Demosthenex> i haven't used it, but that seems like 90% of it =]
[18:16:13] <grym> it reminds me a lot of hypercard

[18:24:04] <Demosthenex> so the idea of making a zettlecast or hyperlink notes together with org and hyperbole sounds fun
[18:24:10] <Demosthenex> but totally outside my use case

[18:59:20] <zebrag> Demosthenex: Thanks, I do appreciate the concern. I also do agree with every steps of your analysis. And yeah, Zettelkasten is more like my idea of things. And really, the only wanting bit would be a stronger tagging system.
[19:01:03] <zebrag> Initially, org-roam was implementing a stronger tags system, was using new file for each entry, and was not using uuid.
[19:01:42] <zebrag> I understand, that with "v2", they have changed their mind on each of the above points.
[19:02:05] *** Joins: seschwar (~seschwar@user/seschwar)
[19:03:09] <zebrag> About tag system, maybe they found it was difficult to implement in a robust way.
[19:03:41] <zebrag> So they switched back to "built-in".
[19:04:31] <zebrag> Did I say, that "v2" has no documentation whatsoever, and is not working so far on my emacs.

[19:14:50] <grym> hyperbole is an "along with" not an "instead of"
[19:16:06] <zebrag> Really, some json thing, might be more suited to the purpose. Not as heavy as html. It is imaginable to edit is with plain text editor. You can use powerful tools such as `jq` on it.
[19:16:29] <zebrag> grym: not defecting then.
[19:17:24] <grym> writing json by hand just sucks
[19:18:37] <bkhl> Especially if you're in an editor built mostly from S-expressions. :-)
[19:19:26] <zebrag> Yes, but all those curly braces makes it more resilient to mistyping. Anyway, I think, I thought, one of the point of org-mode is, let's write html/json, in a less cumbersome way.
[19:21:31] <grym> i don't think that's true at all 
[19:21:47] <zebrag> And, S-expression, json-expression, are the exact same thing. You might be able to translate one into the other with `sed`.
[19:21:56] <grym> i don't think that's true at all 
[19:22:27] <bkhl> Nope, JSON painfully does not have symbols.
[19:23:41] <zebrag> grym: Right, I sure should have expected you would totally disagree ;)
[19:24:45] <grym> there are matters of opinons and matters of fact, and it's my opinion that this is a matter of fact
[19:24:49] <zebrag> Okay then, translate, but in an "adjunction" sort of way.

[21:51:34] <Demosthenex> i mean, i'd expect you could just dump sql via shell script and make org headlines with properties as text. how are you doing it?
[21:55:56] <afidegnum> Demosthenex: yes, that's also a good idea,
[21:56:01] <afidegnum> something else come into mind, 
[21:56:10] <afidegnum> it's about manually filling some columns.
[21:56:19] <afidegnum> what do you think?
[21:57:49] <Demosthenex> you could export sql to a org-mode table pretty easily too, one record per line
[21:58:38] <afidegnum> Demosthenex: even with properties, i wanted to have something for field declaration. which could be used to genrate fields in C++ and create table in sql, something like: int: id, string: text whichever position 
[21:58:53] <Demosthenex> afidegnum: sure you don't want gnu recutils?
[21:58:56] <afidegnum> so when fields are created, I can generate structs, sql tables, 
[22:00:00] <afidegnum> how compatible will it be with org-mode ?
[22:00:41] <Demosthenex> varying degrees. it just sounds like you want structured data in text and database style access. that's recutils. org has limited metadata capabilites that can be abused for very simple databases, but not like that
[22:00:51] <Demosthenex> you can always call recutils with literal blocks
[22:00:53] <Demosthenex> er, literate
[22:01:00] <Demosthenex> tangle a file, run some commands
[22:01:15] <Demosthenex> emacs is a fine way to edit recutils too
[22:01:31] <afidegnum> i build my own field converter, but got limited along the way
[22:01:50] <afidegnum> that was in elisp 
[22:02:17] <Demosthenex> sure. otoh you're talking in very general terms ;]
[22:02:47] <afidegnum> ok, let me read more about recutils and see how will it fit,

[22:09:33] <Demosthenex> not sure. you can tangle anything, it's how you report on it that's the question
[22:09:55] <afidegnum> yes, that's the crux of the problem
[22:11:58] <Demosthenex> like, if you put things into org metadata, you have very rudimentary reporting
[22:12:07] <Demosthenex> if you put it in sql, you have to get it there somehow
[22:12:57] <afidegnum> yes, i'm more interested in the metadata aspect so I can reuse in various cases
[22:15:29] <Demosthenex> i think the best thing is that org metadata can be viewed and edited in column-view mode, but other than that i think you'll be disappointed
[22:16:34] <afidegnum> the closest i'm looking at now is recutils and metadata

[22:52:32] <afidegnum> Demosthenex: what do you think of org-capture ? 
[22:53:22] <Demosthenex> afidegnum: use it all the time. very basic templating
[22:53:29] <Demosthenex> you can do more with skel/abbrev or yasnippet
[22:54:01] <afidegnum> yes, my initial utility extensively uses yasnippet
[22:54:33] <Demosthenex> i found skel/abbrev easier and removed yas a while back
[22:54:37] <Demosthenex> but i only had 2 templates
[22:55:13] <afidegnum> skel for me is kind of tedious, where i have to manually append \n at the end of my template files
[22:56:21] <Demosthenex> yeah, but i didn't want to have separate files for yas. also i got caught up in a problem with yas caching after an upgrade and chased it for a few hours to find it never updated and just used cached values. i tossed it and went to skel/abbrev
[22:56:40] *** Joins: TanoMarcelo (~TanoMarce@179.63.242.126)
[23:00:25] <afidegnum> well, the problem is:  i'm building a complete web application,  where each database tables have to match corresponding routes. as well as configurable HTTP verbs. i.e todo table, ADD-DELETE-MODIFY-CREATE. some database could have more than 140 tables, and i have to manually configure specific fields, based on queries supplied. 
[23:01:17] <afidegnum> so if am to build an application of that nature, I would have to define individual fields, routes, forms, etc... I gess you are seing the extent of the complexity?
[23:01:42] <afidegnum> not to talk about the content management, users and permmissions etc.. 
[23:02:49] <Demosthenex> sounds like a job for lisp macros, not org-mode
[23:03:09] <Demosthenex> plan it out in org, but the webapp shouldnt' touch org directly
[23:03:20] <Demosthenex> and if you're trying to organize code to write code, macros are better ;]
[23:03:49] <afidegnum> i'm still not abreast with macros yet, still struggling to get around it 
[23:05:10] <afidegnum> what I pland was to organize the code on org-mode, then capture the fields and maybe contents to generate the code, 
[23:05:35] <afidegnum> which balls down to manually select parameters, fields, and generate the code accordingly

[23:17:20] <Demosthenex> capture fields are properties, and they are only k/v pairs

[23:19:10] <afidegnum> ouch!
[23:19:22] <Demosthenex> i have no idea what macros rust has
[23:19:39] <Demosthenex> but in common lisp, you could write fairly complicated self creating code for sql
[23:19:42] <Demosthenex> i've done it many times
[23:19:45] <afidegnum> Macros in rust, I prefer the Lisp version
[23:20:46] <afidegnum> I'm a bit familiar with COmmon Lisp as well, but got confused on the interractive field selections
[23:20:48] <Demosthenex> yeah, i have in many places used a list of fields to generate sql
[23:20:53] <afidegnum> hence turning back to elisp 
[23:21:12] <afidegnum> maybe I need to look for a way to use CL and Elisp together 
[23:21:12] <Demosthenex> https://dpaste.org/ASn3  i use that in TXR to create tables
[23:21:42] <Demosthenex> so while elisp is handy, i don't think it's a good choice for a webapp. 
[23:22:24] <afidegnum> elisp for the the templating, not the webapp development
[23:22:45] <afidegnum> https://dpaste.org/ASn3 is that CL or Elisp ?

[23:23:46] <Demosthenex> hrm, does org's latex export not allow macro expansion in #+latex_header: lines?

[23:24:01] <Demosthenex> which is another lispy lang
[23:24:08] <Demosthenex> but also not macro, juts generating sql
[23:24:21] <afidegnum> wow, i'm not aware or that, do you have some docs about it ?
[23:24:44] <afidegnum> I've read on few occasions the use of Latex from the properties header, 
[23:24:57] <Demosthenex> becomes this https://dpaste.org/LPZg
[23:24:57] <afidegnum> but it has to be installed from babel
[23:25:24] <Demosthenex> well the latex question was for anyone to answer =]
[23:25:50] <Demosthenex> i do pretty sophisticated latex exports, just opened an old template and surprised my macros didn't expand
[23:26:51] <afidegnum> you will need to add this: #+LATEX: any arbitrary LaTeX code
[23:27:30] <afidegnum> and #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
[23:27:40] <afidegnum> #+END_EXPORT
[23:28:45] <Demosthenex> https://dpaste.org/2YsN  that's my header :P
[23:29:06] <Demosthenex> i'm trying to make it load no class, and specify all the options in my file
[23:30:00] <Demosthenex> unfortunately it's not honoring TITLE, AUTHOR, etc in my header and footer
[23:30:08] <Demosthenex> which means macro expansion is broken
[23:30:20] <afidegnum> i've found something which you might like: https://opensource.com/article/20/4/emacs-org-mode
[23:30:23] <Demosthenex> worked before, so must be new
[23:30:37] <afidegnum> yes, new changes i guess
[23:31:12] <Demosthenex> yep. i've actually paid a latex expert to make me style sheets for org for writing professional documentation
