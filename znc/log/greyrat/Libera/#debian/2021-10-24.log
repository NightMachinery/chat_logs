[01:13:27] <johnjay> is there a standardized naming convention for documentation
[01:13:48] <johnjay> like apt-cache search name | grep doc because it usually ends in -doc?
[01:15:16] <tomreyn> johnjay: man pages are actually provided by the main package, -doc would be additional upstream documentation in a different format
[01:16:11] <johnjay> i assume that's an on ad hoc basis

[05:24:12] <udaba> Hello! Is anyone using Gnome on unstable here?
[05:24:44] <udaba> cant optimize my interface after upgrading from stable
[05:25:11] <n4dir> udaba: you probably want the debian testing channel on the OFTC network
[05:25:14] <n4dir> !testing
[05:25:14] <dpkg> Testing is a continuously updated release between <stable> and <unstable>, currently codenamed <bookworm>. See http://wiki.debian.org/DebianTesting . Support in #debian-next on irc.oftc.net; ask me about <testing faq> <bullseye->bookworm> <testing security> <moving target> <apt-listchanges> <apt-listbugs> and <bts>. You need a sound knowledge of Debian and be prepared for a very bumpy ride. Don't use it on things that are critical!
[05:25:49] <udaba> Im really new to this now XD
[05:26:16] <PMT> Why are you running unstable, then?
[05:26:19] <n4dir> besides this being the "wrong" channel, your chances are much higher in #debian-next
[05:26:55] <udaba> fixing some bugs of me , but i suppose brings new like interface :P
[05:28:17] <sams> johnjay, it appears to be a ufw bug, if i allow my sip provider subnet and also my local lan subnet, web ports (and others i guess) are open to the world. if i do first subnet and just allow certain local lan ips its fine, shrug
[05:28:26] <udaba> for example discord stopped crashing , nvidia drivers updated , firefox 91 version , i was hoping to see open snitch on packages too but no luck
[05:29:09] <udaba> so for my apt lists to be correct test and not unstable is correct?
[05:30:36] <n4dir> if you want to use debian-testing, then you need testing (or bookworm) in sources list, for debian unstable you need unstable (or sid).
[05:30:46] <n4dir> but that seems obvious, perhaps i misunderstood your question
[05:31:04] <udaba> oh thanks :)
[05:31:37] <n4dir> if you add unstable/sid sources to your sources list, and don't do anything more, all of the system will be upgraded to unstable/sid
[05:31:43] <PMT> if you've already installed a bunch from unstable, going to testing instead is...a fraught notion.
[05:31:55] <n4dir> you can make testing default, and only install a few packages from unstable
[05:32:16] *** Quits: vakera_pingveno (~dan@107-209-165-75.lightspeed.hstntx.sbcglobal.net) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[05:32:22] <n4dir> also make sure to install "apt-listbugs", assuming i remember the package name correct (i think i do)
[05:32:40] <n4dir> and, depending on your situation, make sure to have a good backup solution.
[05:32:55] <PMT> Careful with that package. It can result in having impossible package upgrade setups.
[05:33:16] <udaba> just want to stay on unstable :D i was misunderstood too
[05:33:19] <n4dir> PMT: i didn't run in problems, but it is quite a while ago.
[05:33:25] <udaba> unstable seems PERFECT
[05:33:31] <awal1> udaba, if you want to run Unstable, use the current "stable" installer to install a minimal stable system (recommended), upgrade it to Testing, then to Unstable , then install the pkgs you want on Unstable. upgrading a whole system from stable to Testing to Unstable is not recommended. check   https://wiki.debian.org/DebianUnstable
[05:33:38] <udaba> try to set somehow the interface with gnome
[05:33:39] <n4dir> PMT: as in, thanks for giving a "warning"
[05:33:54] <PMT> n4dir: I first heard of the package when someone came by with apt install reporting it was impossible to install something
[05:34:13] <n4dir> PMT: as said, to me unstable is sure a decade ago, if not longer
[05:34:25] <PMT> and it turned out they had just pressed "block everything with a serious enough bug"
[05:34:51] <udaba> So should i run testing and then unstable?
[05:35:08] <awal1> read the ling
[05:35:10] <awal1> link
[05:35:11] <n4dir> don't even recall such an option exited, PMT . I just got the info, then could decide wether i can live with it or not
[05:35:12] <udaba> Thinking of reformat , was running stable and today i upgraded to unstable
[05:35:59] <awal1> full system downgrades are not supported by Debian pkg managers
[05:36:07] <PMT> n4dir: the apt preferences files definitely had comments above each entry saying added by ...
[05:36:13] <awal1> dpkg: frankendebian
[05:36:13] <dpkg> When you get random packages from random repositories, mix multiple releases of Debian, or mix Debian and derived distributions, you have a mess.  There's no way anyone can support this "distribution of Frankenstein" and #debian certainly doesn't want to even try. See https://wiki.debian.org/DontBreakDebian and <reinstall>
[05:36:19] <awal1> udaba ^
[05:37:04] <udaba> xD
[05:37:09] <n4dir> you can mix testing/unstable though, as said
[05:37:44] <udaba> Thats what im going to do.So im going to boot into clean stable and set it to testing?
[05:37:46] <n4dir> some like that, but pure sid is a bit more straight forward.
[05:38:05] <udaba> Yes i thought its was Stable>unstable>testing
[05:38:12] <PMT> ....what?
[05:38:19] <PMT> who said that?
[05:38:23] <udaba> noone
[05:38:28] <udaba> Thats what i thought :P
[05:38:30] <n4dir> also, you said you use gnome, make sure to always have a window-manager around. Just in case ...
[05:38:38] <PMT> You should probably read things rather than just thinking them.
[05:39:02] <udaba> You are right.
[05:39:15] <awal1> udaba, again:  use the current "stable" installer to install a minimal stable system , upgrade that minimal system to Testing, then the same minimal system  to Unstable , then install the pkgs you want on Unstable
[05:39:34] <udaba> Thanks!! :)
[05:40:06] <n4dir> good luck. and fun.
[05:41:01] <awal1> if you are new debian user, i suggest you a window manager on unstable, or at least xfce (more conservative desktop environment), . big desktop env. /kde, gnome) are more buggy
[05:41:12] <awal1> but up to you :)
[05:41:17] <n4dir> same thoughts from me
[05:41:18] <udaba> Thanks for that , Plasma is good?
[05:41:49] <awal1> you can always try stuff (kde...) on a vm
[05:42:08] <awal1> they are all good, it is a matter of needs...

[05:43:10] <n4dir> but, as said, all that really depends on the situation
[05:43:13] <awal1> my best suggestion:
[05:43:30] <udaba> Well i just want to browse and play some games , im a very minimalist guy
[05:43:36] <awal1> you run stable (kde or what ever you want) and try other stuff in a vm
[05:43:47] <awal1> try unstable or what you want
[05:44:01] <awal1> vm (virtual machine)
[05:44:11] <n4dir> there have been distributions based on debian-sid. Back then, sidux, then siduction and something different, perhaps aptosid
[05:44:18] <udaba> will go with testing and check if discord fixes and firefox and nvidia-drivers version
[05:44:22] <n4dir> not sure how supported they are right now
[05:44:24] <awal1> when you are more comfortable with gnu/linux, you install in a real hardware
[05:44:39] <udaba> To be honest im gonna choose something with good support.
[05:44:55] <awal1> good support is Stable
[05:45:19] <awal1> bug are fixed quickly on Unstable than on Testing
[05:45:43] <awal1> well, browse debian wiki to read stuff befor eyou act...
[05:45:45] <udaba> So Sid is gonna be forever Sid-Unstable?
[05:45:59] <n4dir> yes

[05:46:11] <udaba> Thanks
[05:46:22] <n4dir> udaba: there is the Sid FAQ, somehwere in the wiki. Thought it seems a bit exagerated
[05:46:44] <n4dir> and, really, the #debian-next channel on OFTC irc network
[05:47:01] <udaba> I will try it out
[05:47:17] <n4dir> when i ran sid i upgraded at minimum once a day
[05:47:22] <n4dir> sometimes even more.
[05:47:45] <n4dir> to not run into too many problem at once (and no, i didn't run in many problems)
[05:48:06] <udaba> Well i dont use a lot of apps .
[05:48:22] <udaba> The chances that will broke something on are a few.
[05:48:25] <n4dir> still you *can* run in something all the time. Just be prepared for it
[05:48:29] <udaba> there are but you never know
[05:48:39] <udaba> Of course im aware:)
[05:49:04] <n4dir> i had fun with it. But i can live with the PC not working suddenly.
[05:49:10] <n4dir> and i had a lot of luck, on top
[05:49:49] <n4dir> what awal1 proposed, a VM, or a dual boot, or second PC/laptop. All good options
[05:50:17] <udaba> Going to buy a laptop next month.
[05:50:30] <udaba> I need a RAM stick for this , not even running on dual channel right now.
[05:50:40] <udaba> it will be done to.
[05:50:49] <n4dir> the worst which could have happened to me is having to re-install and set the machine up in something like an hour. I for one always have that time
[05:51:09] <udaba> I run Debian about 6 months now still feeling like "new" here. but seems more familiar now

[07:32:40] <tinyweasel> yeah, 256-512MB of RAM for some VMs, but that's on public cloud
[07:32:52] <infinity> docker ?
[07:33:03] <tinyweasel> docker can go to /dev/null for me
[07:33:13] <infinity> heh. just thinking maybe fewer VMs
[07:33:19] <tinyweasel> yeah, it's fine, though
[07:33:35] <tinyweasel> if I could stay with kernel v3, I'd do it because it wouldn't be maintained by M$ employees
[07:33:44] <tinyweasel> but fine... openbsd *one day*
[07:34:39] <infinity> I was on a bsd machine the other day. it was 15 year old hardware and seemed very snappy.
[07:36:13] <infinity> is the latest pre compiled kernel 5.10 ? hmm
[07:36:24] <tinyweasel> well, also, with v5, there are issues with ryzen, I've heard
[07:36:42] <tinyweasel> but debian/devuan for the desktop will have to suffice for now, and I'll just use openbsd in VMs/on baremetal
[07:39:39] <PMT> I mean, the SME issues are only a specific set of possible complications, and are off by default now anyway for that reason.

[13:20:35] <Khepra> bottom line is balance of probabilities. what effort you invest in securing your system   vs  how likely it is to be pwnt and for what gains.
[13:20:37] <shtrb> right now I have a VM just to login and work with "gov" sites, another VM for education , another for entertiament etc etc etc.
[13:20:46] <f8e4_> use 2 devices: debian for mainstream; tails + usb for 'can i f my mother' type of inquiries
[13:20:54] <Khepra> shtrb: I have bad news for you :)
[13:21:15] <shtrb> I know they can pwn me , I just lower the surface vector
[13:21:59] <Khepra> a compromised VM can break ASLR on your host's kernel abusing any of the still unpatched meltdown or spectre vulns and if you don't have ECC RAM, rowhammer its way into your host. easy peasy.
[13:23:10] <Khepra> the point I'm trying to make here, if you're a target of such an elaborate attack (and the question is how likely that is), then VMs per se don't mean much if you also don't use hardware base restrictions
[13:24:49] <shtrb> Khepra, I'm more into , they used to have vb on client side, I can't trust they wouldn't break stuff on my system, If they wished they probably hacked already my system
[13:25:13] <Khepra> this is why all this talk is very silly. for vast majority of users, defaults are more than enough. "Just don't be dumb and don't run random software you find online".     for anything else -- targeted, sophisticated attacks -- this talk, "securing sudo" and running VMs, is very silly as it offers faslse sense of security.
[13:26:48] <Khepra> shtrb: right. but that's far, far off from the orignal question of "why would your daily user have sudo rights". because for vast, vast majority of users, default sudo rights are quite okay.
[13:28:25] <shtrb> I actually gave a a user sudo that could shutdown and apt-get on their machine, it was good enough to let them learn (and let them damage the system in a way I could save it later) but not enough to bring total havoc
[13:28:47] <Khepra> the 5.14 kernel brings much improvement in this area, btw. permitting you to configure process scheduling so it never leaves specific core (by default the scheduler will schedule processes all over the cpu)
[13:30:04] <Khepra> shtrb: unless they knew of a vulnerable suid bearing package, apt instaled it and rooted you :)

[15:56:45] <new_guest_21> Hello, I am trying to force apt to install recommended packages on my Debian 11 "Bullseye" server, but it's not working. My `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/00InstallRecommends` has `APT::Install-Recommends "false";`, but `sudo apt-get install --install-recommends dirmngr gpg-agent apt-transport-https` only installs the named packages, not the recommended
[15:56:45] <new_guest_21> packages. What am I missing here?
[15:57:39] <shtrb> new_guest_21,  Isn't APT::Install-Recommends "false" mean you will not install it
[15:58:00] <new_guest_21> But I am forcing it in the apt command, so that should override it, no?
[15:58:05] <pert> shtrb: yes, but new_guest_21 intends for the command-line flag to override it
[15:58:07] *** Joins: orangeextract (~orangeext@user/orangeextract)
[15:58:09] <new_guest_21> If not, how do I override it?
[15:58:55] <new_guest_21> Unfortunately, I couldn't find `--install-recommends` option in the man page either. https://manpages.debian.org/bullseye/apt/apt.8.en.html → https://manpages.debian.org/bullseye/apt/apt-get.8.en.html
[15:59:19] <new_guest_21> So I'm wondering if it was removed or something...
[16:00:25] <pert> I'm not sure there is a way to override it from the command-line. Here's a couple pertinent bug reports: #894976 and #809926
[16:00:26] <judd> Bug https://bugs.debian.org/894976 in apt (open): «apt-get --install-recommends --reinstall install x should install recommends for already installed package»; severity: normal; opened: 2018-04-05; last modified: 2018-04-05.
[16:00:59] <pert> The latter says that --install-recommends doesn't do what it sounds like it does; instead, it merely undoes --no-install-recommends if you had set that *on the command line*
[16:01:48] <new_guest_21> I see...
[16:04:55] <new_guest_21> `sudo apt-get install -o APT::Install-Recommends="true" dirmngr gpg-agent apt-transport-https` doesn't work either. :/
[16:05:06] <new_guest_21> So I suppose modifying the apt config. file is the only way to go?

[18:06:22] <letterrip> becuase it worked perfectly before
[18:06:33] <letterrip> and it works fine on other systems
[18:06:45] <letterrip> and there were recent changes in the configuration of usbcore
[18:06:52] <letterrip> with the 5.x series
[18:06:57] <somiaj> so if you download the 4.19 kernel from buster it works?
[18:07:13] <letterrip> it worked when i was using buster - yes
[18:07:20] <somiaj> https://wiki.debian.org/DebianKernel/GitBisect
[18:07:35] <somiaj> well that wasn't what I asked, 'when using buster' is not the same as does it work with the buster kernel on your current system

[18:08:05] <letterrip> so - this isn't an issue you've heard of before?
[18:08:07] <somiaj> Just wanting to make sure it really is the kernel and not something else, but anyways, that wiki has some ways to help track down the commit that caused this regression, to help you provide a good bug report
[18:08:22] <somiaj> I haven't heard of anyone here with it, and so far I haven't noticed any usb issues
[18:08:43] <somiaj> if it was a known issue you could find a bug report, hence why I suggested make sure it wasn't hardware releated
[18:11:11] <letterrip> some googling suggests similar issues on ubuntu - related to changes in usbcore flags - https://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-797789.html
[18:11:56] <somiaj> do they have a fix?
[18:12:09] <somiaj> something you could provide the debian kernel team to maybe work with?

[18:21:41] <Filystyn> but how the fuck i invoke it
[18:21:52] <Filystyn> nc uses soem sys default
[18:22:55] <somiaj> again don't hit enter so often, and try to keep language family friendly.
[18:23:35] <somiaj> In the case there are multiple packages providing the same binary, debian uses an alternative system to allow nc to point to the binary of your choice. Check update-alternatives to change what nc actually points to.
[18:23:37] <Filystyn> it's on server so tab won't help me
[18:24:05] <somiaj> In the case of just running it, dpkg -L openbsd-netcat shows that it provides the binary /usr/bin/nc.openbsd -- so that is the actual binary name
[18:24:41] <letterrip> somiaj - might actually be hardware afterall - underpowered hub? - https://paulphilippov.com/articles/how-to-fix-device-not-accepting-address-error
[18:24:46] <somiaj> you may find 'update-alternatives --config nc' will allow you to set which one it is.
[18:24:47] <Filystyn> nice
[18:24:49] <Filystyn> thank you
[18:25:41] <somiaj> letterrip: that seems reasonable, usb can have power issues if to many things are connected to it. If using a usb hub, power can be a problem.
[18:26:51] <letterrip> well i don't have any devices - but there is an internal camera
[18:27:06] <letterrip> that isn't being registered properly
[18:27:20] <letterrip> (no driver) so perhaps it is messing with things
[18:27:24] <somiaj> ahh so this isn't an external hub. Maybe the internal hub isn't getting enough power or some other issue.

[18:29:20] <letterrip> worked fine in older ubuntu; worked fine in buster - but might have been old
[18:29:48] <letterrip> may be the kernel is managing usb power differently
[18:31:14] <letterrip> (by fine - slow and a little finnicky, but connected 95% of time - vs almost never)

[18:33:19] <letterrip> it is a usb external drive
[18:33:25] <letterrip> spinning rust
[18:33:33] <letterrip> not ssd
[18:33:52] <somiaj> this will give you a clear test if the kernel has any major difference, since bullseye runs fine on the 4.19 kernel
[18:33:58] <letterrip> ok
[18:34:01] <somiaj> and it doesn't have a power cord to power it?
[18:34:15] <letterrip> nope - designed to be powered from the usb port
[18:34:30] <somiaj> It could be a power issue, those drives can take a lot of power, and if they are wanting all the power from usb, maybe windows just better understands this device needs more power and is more paitent with it
[18:34:52] <letterrip> well it worked in prior linux versions on debian and ubuntu
[18:35:04] <letterrip> including with additional devices plugged in
[18:35:13] <somiaj> yea, I would try the previous kernel, you might be able to track down ways to tell the kernel to give more power

[21:26:31] <infinity> Not so worried about security. I feel like it's more secure than windows either way.
[21:27:17] <infinity> I just want wireguard, airpods, etc :)
[21:28:54] <sney> if you're comfortable with debian tools, you can try it. IME testing is fairly smooth this time around, right now; but that could change at any moment.
[21:29:18] <sney> I am also using it on a laptop, but just because it works fine on my old T430 doesn't mean you'll have the same experience with whatever hardware you're using.
[21:29:21] <sney> !moving target
[21:29:21] <dpkg> Sure, testing might be shinier than stable, but are you prepared to be continually updating your system?  Things that worked today will break tomorrow.  Configuration file formats will change and you'll have to fold your changes in yet again.  Testing is a moving target and if you'd rather work *with* your computer than working *on* your computer, you might not want that.  See <testing security>.
[21:29:48] <sney> and yes, as PMT said, if you are going to try it, useful support can be found in #debian-next on OFTC (note, right now you are on libera) as that is where the other testing users go.

[22:47:37] <deego> I earlier asked for a version of dpkg -S to use in programs. someone suggested apt-file. However, i think apt-file returns all pkgs that /would/ provide that file. Moreover, it would ignore locally installed pkgs.
[22:47:50] <deego> sussudio, infinity ^^
[22:48:04] <deego> (finally, yes, it's not installed by default)
[22:48:16] <sney> yes, apt-file uses the Contents file from the mirror, so anything installed locally and anything from 3rd party repos that don't provide Contents wouldn't be searched
[22:49:15] <deego> whereas, i'm simply looking to find out the pkg that provided the file on /my/ server.
[22:49:37] <sney> other than calling dpkg from your application, there might be something you could hook in libapt-pkg?

[23:10:07] <sussudio> deego: if you want to see what file is being used by what at this moment, use lsof and grep
[23:10:42] <deego> sussudio: i'm lost. how does that tell me what pkg installed that file?
[23:11:53] <sussudio> deego: it doesn't, but apt-file does, like i said before. lsof tells you what files are in use.
