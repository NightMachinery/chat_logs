[02:59:41] <audrey> I'm okay I think. My mom is very stressed.
[03:00:31] <audrey> Feeling kind of upset that I lost a fair bit of money due to the sanctions, but that's a minor nuisance compared to some of the stuff that's happening.
[03:02:42] <audrey> Better to be on this side of the new Iron Curtain, I guess, LOL.
[03:03:34] <audrey> At least until the US dollar crashes.

[06:40:57] <Ungwelian> It's definitely chaos.
[06:41:57] <Ungwelian> The most insane comment I read was that a global nuclear war would benefit the environment.
[06:43:22] <audrey> [Cartoon of Senator Lindsay Graham waking up and looking outside his bedroom window to see a huge, orange mushroom cloud. Caption: "For the first time in his life, Senator Graham wonders whether there is such a thing as too high a price to pay for democracy."]
[06:54:24] <I_Am_M00t> "if Russia doesn't back down, we don't have a choice do we?"

[07:43:07] <biys> haha
[07:43:11] <biys> yah
[07:43:11] <causative_> nobody's nuking anybody, Putin is evil but not insane
[07:43:21] <biys> "evil"
[07:43:25] <causative_> he knows that nukes only lead to everyone losing
[07:43:29] <causative_> including him
[07:43:37] <biys> i'm hung up on evil
[07:43:58] <biys> no such thing as evil
[07:44:27] <causative_> bombing civilians to puff up your chest is evil
[07:44:50] <audrey> Geopolitics and "evil" don't really belong in the same paragraph, IMO.
[07:45:05] <audrey> I don't get what it is with this American fixation on framing everything in terms of black and white morality.
[07:45:10] <audrey> Too many cowboy Westerns?
[07:45:30] <biys> i've been sick for 4 weeks
[07:45:32] <audrey> Anyway, it's amusing to see the White House and top military brass struggle with this
[07:45:33] <biys> i blame russia
[07:45:48] <causative_> the kind of people who say "there is no black and white right and wrong" and the kind of people who endorse evil, maybe do it themselves, but are trying to rationalize it
[07:45:55] <causative_> *are the kind of people
[07:46:01] <audrey> Cool story, bro.
[07:46:11] <audrey> biys: Aww, sorry to hear. Are you any better now?
[07:46:16] <causative_> it would be most convenient to the evildoer if what he was doing wasn't wrong
[07:46:18] <audrey> I haven't been around much lately on IRC
[07:46:34] <biys> me either
[07:46:44] <biys> i decided to go b ack to work
[07:46:46] <audrey> Been enjoying myself too much, writing novels and learning great piano literature
[07:46:58] <causative_> conversely, if someone sees someone else doing horrible things and wants to stop them, that's the kind of person to talk about good and evil; the person trying to stop the evil
[07:47:08] <audrey> Decided to mix it up a little with IRC again, especially as i decided to quit one of the Discord servers I'd been active on
[07:47:20] <audrey> due to the sudden and colossal increase in casual rusophobia
[07:47:26] <causative_> if morality is real, then morality is geopolitical
[07:47:50] <audrey> I'm old enough to remember Afghanistan and Iraq and Libya ... and even old enough to remember Serbia
[07:48:01] <audrey> It's the same playbook, and it's quite sad to me that nobody else seems to have figured out the pattern yet.
[07:48:04] <causative_> killing someone to stroke your ego is evil, whether you're a serial killer or a president
[07:48:14] <audrey> causative_: Nobody's really interested in your hot air, you know
[07:48:27] <biys> i'm interested in it... but it's a lot of declarations
[07:48:28] <audrey> biys: How's the kid?
[07:48:31] <causative_> why don't you ever talk philosophy
[07:48:35] <biys> kids are also sick
[07:48:42] <biys> but the boy is almost over it, along with the wife
[07:48:42] <causative_> you treat this as a social chat channel
[07:48:43] <audrey> Damn, sorry to hear. :(
[07:48:45] <causative_> it's ##philosophy
[07:48:49] <biys> girl still has the cough, like i
[07:48:59] <causative_> and you're acting as if the actual philosophy is what's off topic
[07:49:02] <causative_> instead of what you're doing
[07:49:20] <biys> i'm more-so someone who's a moral nihilist
[07:49:31] <biys> instead of someone who's some form of stephan molyneays universal prefereable behaviour
[07:49:44] <audrey> Molyneay?
[07:49:46] <audrey> Who's that
[07:49:50] <audrey> Feels like it's someone I should know
[07:49:52] <biys> molyneau
[07:49:53] <audrey> Moynihan?
[07:49:55] <causative_> biys, some states of affairs are preferable to other states of affairs, and we should work to make those happen
[07:50:22] <biys> preferable to who?
[07:50:33] <biys> it's all a matter of the way you frame it
[07:50:37] <causative_> always to the individual
[07:50:39] <biys> and from what perspective
[07:50:59] <causative_> I can make two statements: some states of affairs are preferable to you over other states of affairs, and you want to work to make those happen
[07:51:07] <biys> i'll tell you something.  we're closer to tyrannosaurus than tyrannosaurus is to stegosaurus.  what does that tell you?
[07:51:12] <biys> that humans are but a blip
[07:51:14] <biys> not even a blip
[07:51:17] <causative_> and some states of affairs are preferable to me over other states of affairs, and I want to work to make those happen
[07:51:23] <biys> it seems you're suggesting some kind of neo-geocenterism
[07:51:28] <biys> humans are not the center of the universe
[07:51:40] <causative_> not at all
[07:52:22] <causative_> I just said it's about what the individual prefers
[07:52:30] <biys> the individual doesn't really matter
[07:52:41] <causative_> the individual who is you, matters to you
[07:52:59] <biys> yes, when i touch something hot, i typically move my hand
[07:53:15] <causative_> you can't escape the fact that you're locked in a human brain - what matters to that particular human brain is what matters to you. You aren't an abstract entity out in the cosmos.
[07:53:39] <biys> i can separate that idea from the idea that my ``feelings'' matter to me && my feelings don't matter to the universe
[07:53:46] <biys> my feelings don't even, likely, matter to my neighbour
[07:53:55] <biys> my feelings don't matter that much
[07:54:01] <causative_> but they matter to you
[07:54:19] <biys> i don't even know if they really matter to me...
[07:54:26] <biys> if my feelings mattered... i don't think i'd be going to work
[07:54:42] <causative_> do you really think you would feel better if you stopped going to work entirely?
[07:54:51] <biys> for a time being, likely
[07:55:03] <causative_> your desire for prestige, respectability, social approval, and material comforts are what drive you to go to work
[07:55:13] <causative_> those are all feelings
[07:55:26] <biys> and you're saying those matter?
[07:55:29] <causative_> you have conflicting feelings as well, but the "go to work" feelings are winning out
[07:55:33] <causative_> they matter to you
[07:55:40] <biys> i don't even think they matter to me
[07:55:48] <causative_> they motivate your behavior
[07:56:00] <biys> my feelings?
[07:56:05] <causative_> yes
[07:56:11] <biys> i don't think my feelings motivate my behaviours
[07:56:14] <causative_> you do what you do because you feel like it
[07:56:19] <biys> HAH
[07:56:29] <biys> no i don't
[07:56:48] <biys> i do what i do because it is the most reasonable thing to do at this point in time
[07:56:55] <biys> it is far from what i ``feel'' like doing
[07:57:26] <causative_> you just are conflicted - you may not feel like going to work but you also *do* feel like it, and the latter wins out
[07:57:42] <biys> it's a pretty hard motor to start in the morning
[07:57:47] <biys> i'll tell you what
[07:57:57] <biys> most of the time i just hit the snooze bar until it's too late
[07:58:11] <biys> trust me, there is absolutely not desire to go to work
[07:58:12] <causative_> we evolved emotions to drive us to do things
[07:58:22] <causative_> without emotions we wouldn't do anything, we'd have no reason to, because we wouldn't care
[07:58:26] <causative_> so we'd just starve and die
[07:58:48] <biys> does that uh.. space worm have feelings?
[07:58:59] <causative_> what space worm?
[07:59:01] <causative_> it's emotions that make us decide what is most reasonable or expedient in a given situation
[07:59:08] <causative_> logic is a slave to the passions
[07:59:13] * audrey sprinkles a few triggered wojaks into the chat
[07:59:45] <biys> tardigrade
[07:59:48] <biys> i think it's called
[08:00:04] <causative_> well my views on that kind of thing are nonstandard and would lead us down a rabbit hole
[08:00:12] <biys> unless you mean like...  i feel hungry, so i shove food in my mouth
[08:00:21] <causative_> that's a good example
[08:00:35] <biys> i don't even really want to feed myself
[08:00:38] <biys> it's so much effort
[08:00:43] <biys> i literally wish i could eat grass
[08:00:46] <causative_> you are of two minds about it
[08:00:57] <causative_> but the mind that wants to feed yourself constantly wins over the mind that doesn't
[08:01:04] <causative_> because its feelings are stronger
[08:02:06] <causative_> once you accept that, there's another step:  there's what you want, and then there's what you *really* want.  Or what you think you want and what you really want.
[08:02:27] <causative_> morality is about what you *really* want - in other words, what you would want if you thought things through more fully.
[08:03:09] <causative_> or in other words, it's about what a more enlightened version of yourself would want
[08:03:27] <biys> well sure, i want to be fed
[08:03:32] <mycroftiv> causative_: and id say also included as broad a spectrum of opinion and input as possible, including from the future, but perhaps this is already inherent in your thinking
[08:03:34] <biys> that's hard for me to say that it actually matters
[08:04:02] <mycroftiv> what observers in the past would hope you do, and what observers in the future will wish you did
[08:04:34] <biys> well that is kind of exactly the point
[08:04:42] <biys> my death could be, in the future, some kind of net gain
[08:04:52] <mycroftiv> since i see the symmetry of observation, experience, action, as a way of generating the idea of univeral continuous compassion
[08:04:54] <causative_> well, mycroftiv , observers in the past or the future may be dumb - it's about what an ideally informed and reasonable version of you would want, even if this mind never actually exists at any point in time
[08:04:57] <biys> prolonging my life as a result of my own desires/wants could actually be a net negative on the planet
[08:05:04] <biys> i could give scenarios of this
[08:05:07] <causative_> morality is not a matter of voting
[08:05:15] <causative_> just like math is not a matter of voting
[08:05:17] <biys> but it's a far stretch to say that because i want to be fed, my feelings matter
[08:05:20] <causative_> they're both matters of thinking things through
[08:05:24] <mycroftiv> causative_: what i care about is how my actions make them -feel- more than their intelligence or dumbness
[08:05:52] <mycroftiv> what they wish me to do, with me counting their opinion as just as valid as mine, because i am not a solipsist and believe their feelings are real
[08:05:53] <causative_> okay, so you're not taking their advice at face value
[08:06:00] <causative_> you're just considering their feelings
[08:06:12] <mycroftiv> causative_: which i only know if they tell me from their face
[08:06:29] <mycroftiv> i dont have a 'true feelings' meter other than asking and listening
[08:06:50] <causative_> biys, your feelings matter to you - yes, maybe your life is a net negative, but at the moment you don't truly know or believe that
[08:06:53] <mycroftiv> how to understand the honest opinions of the rest of the universe about how my actions affect it? big question :)
[08:07:07] <causative_> if you did believe that with every part of your being, you would have already acted on it
[08:08:02] <causative_> when you hold a sharp knife, some part of you is always stopping you from stabbing it into your neck - that part of you is not convinced things would be better if you were dead
[08:08:18] <mycroftiv> i actually use bungee cords for this because i dont trust my own brain
[08:08:53] <mycroftiv> before i pick up a knife, i calculate the region its tip will be useful, and constrain its motion to only that region, because im clumsy and twitchy and dont control as well as id like
[08:09:10] <mycroftiv> this is the high level Engineering
[08:09:14] <causative_> mycroftiv, you can ask the opinions of other entities and take them into consideration, but it's not a matter of voting
[08:09:29] <causative_> always the decision you are making is what seems most reasonable to your own self, not those other entities
[08:09:34] <mycroftiv> causative_: with my specific ultrafilter-based decision making it pretty much is
[08:10:20] <mycroftiv> im deliberately opening the causal arrows that drive my actions to an input funnel as wide as possible that does vote-averaging with future inputs also
[08:10:47] <causative_> but why would you want to do that?
[08:11:02] <mycroftiv> to globally optimize for the needs of the universe as a whole including it in the future
[08:11:14] <causative_> and why would you want to do that?
[08:11:32] <mycroftiv> i like the universe and it likes me, i hope, so we try to collaborate, since we are secretly the same thing
[08:11:54] <causative_> well, that's ultimately a *personal* reason to want to do it
[08:12:03] <mycroftiv> i checked and discovered no part of myself was actually different from the universe, it was all contained in it, but i also found a copy of the universe inside my own perceptions
[08:12:06] <causative_> i.e. the ultimate reason is something in your own head, not in other people's heads
[08:12:32] <causative_> you do things because *you* want to do them. Even if you are averaging the votes of other entities, the only reason to do that is if *you* want to. You yourself are the gatekeeper.
[08:12:39] <mycroftiv> causative_: indeed, but i used my perceptual 'teeth' to bite off other people's heads so they are inside me too
[08:13:11] <mycroftiv> i turn myself inside out so the gate is maximally flexible and thus i have infinite faces looking inward talking
[08:13:16] <causative_> but you only do that in so far as you, the original, think it's a good idea
[08:13:36] <mycroftiv> causative_: thats just how the Ouroboros thing goes
[08:14:04] <causative_> "what you should do, is what you would do, if you were fully informed."
[08:14:14] <mycroftiv> identifying the self as the point of action for the entire universe to optimize for its own self interest
[08:15:23] <mycroftiv> once you really understand yourself and your own lack of internal structure apart from what the universe put there, selfishness and selflessness are just how you arbitrarily draw the head/tail of the snake join on the circle
[08:16:03] *** Quits: dez (uid92154@user/dez) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[08:16:07] <mycroftiv> but that level of do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law is generally grossly misunderstood before rather high levels of insight
[08:17:11] <causative_> I agree with you
[08:17:33] <causative_> doing whatever you want can be very evil, unless you are wise enough
[08:17:45] <causative_> doing what you *really* want - what a wiser you would do - is good
[08:17:53] <mycroftiv> causative_: yes, i was trying to harmonize and see if your words and my internal ideas were matching, so i was restating-echoing your conceptual implications in relation to my own vocab
[08:19:31] <causative_> I still don't think it's a matter of voting, though. The problem is counting the voters. When is one mind really two minds, or ten minds, or an infinity of minds?
[08:20:09] <mycroftiv> causative_: ultimately a large cardinal at measurable++ infinity of minds
[08:20:16] <causative_> imagine you have a computer simulating 10,000 minds in parallel - but the catch is they are all copies of the same mind. Should the votes of these minds count once, or 10,000 times?
[08:20:18] <mycroftiv> with local conditions from a countable infinity
[08:20:43] <mycroftiv> causative_: depends on the wiring you have set up! remember mass-energy for computation isnt free
[08:20:59] <causative_> when I say they're copies of the same mind I mean it is a lockstep simulation - every neuron does exactly the same thing on the same simulated time-step, between all the minds
[08:21:15] <mycroftiv> yes, i understand
[08:21:24] <mycroftiv> multiple mind copies generally vote multiple times for sure
[08:21:47] <mycroftiv> and the security protocols to deal with reality hacking and attempting to paperclip are serious business
[08:22:00] <causative_> is it as much a tragedy if you delete one of the 10,000 minds, as if you delete a unique mind that isn't copied anywhere?
[08:22:11] <mycroftiv> of course not
[08:22:18] <causative_> so they morally matter less
[08:22:18] <mycroftiv> thats the great thing about copies
[08:22:28] <mycroftiv> remember in base physical reality we have quantum no-cloning
[08:22:40] <mycroftiv> cant make a perfect quantum copy without eraser the original
[08:22:45] <causative_> you can make perfect simulated copies
[08:22:50] <mycroftiv> yes
[08:22:58] <mycroftiv> and those indeed matter less if you can save/reload
[08:23:05] <mycroftiv> and they get to safe word to do so! :)
[08:23:05] <causative_> those 10,000 minds are really just 1 mind
[08:23:18] <mycroftiv> not from a mass-energy point of view of the lower layer
[08:23:47] <causative_> to say "the computer is simulating 10,000 identical minds" is the same as to say "the computer is simulating one mind with fault-tolerant 10,000x redundancy"
[08:23:57] <causative_> the conclusion I draw from this is that we can't definitively count minds
[08:24:15] <mycroftiv> might as well say 10,000 humans eating a mcdonalds burger is same as 1 human eating a burger, i bet the aliens simulating us just copy-paste that experience
[08:24:29] <causative_> humans don't have identical mental states
[08:24:54] <mycroftiv> how can you tell if your qualia match mine, the alien simulators just noise up our EEGs or something?
[08:25:01] <causative_> but in general yes, I would agree that a lot of people doing approximately the same actions and having very similar mental states, have less moral worth than a lot of people doing all different things
[08:25:14] <mycroftiv> indeed, new information is inherently valuable
[08:26:22] <mycroftiv> i hope you are doing global good and not just selfish good with your work causative_, your ideas are deeply powerful and consequential
[08:27:16] <causative_> well thanks
[08:28:15] <mycroftiv> several names in this channel have expressed ideas so clearly it feels like ive leveled up my capacity to act effectively in the world, i do all this very unusual patterned activity now based on computer-coding in real life causal stacks
[08:28:43] <causative_> if the substrate is continuous then we may have an infinite number of "minds" (or one mind, depending on how you count)
[08:29:08] <mycroftiv> i really believe the multiversal state space has large cardinality so we go way past uncountable
[08:29:31] <mycroftiv> of course thats deeply hard to measure for us but to me its part of the picture
[08:30:02] <mycroftiv> the assumption that it is more likely for the cardinality of the multiversal state space to be a small infinity rather than a large one to me is maybe the opposite of the right insight
[08:30:30] <causative_> the real problem of counting minds, is saying formally and mathematically what a mind is
[08:30:41] <causative_> and to do that we have to first say formally and mathematically what a physical *system* is
[08:30:46] <causative_> and that's fairly tricky
[08:31:08] <mycroftiv> well thats why i think panpsychism and pure information theory and mathematical multiverse view help
[08:31:17] <causative_> or what a simulation is - you can't count the number of simulated things unless you can first formally say what a simulated thing is
[08:31:25] <mycroftiv> lots of Weird Machine partial and overlapping minds
[08:31:50] <mycroftiv> causative_: thats all why i think the counts are very, very, very high
[08:32:11] <mycroftiv> i think the universe counts with maximum possible liberality and thats the bootstrap of existence
[08:33:31] <mycroftiv> we all want as much Cool Stuff to exist as possible, so we self-created ourselves as this universe, of which we as little pieces of see just a tiny bit of our ongoing Work
[08:34:49] <mycroftiv> that leads to as much logically consistent stuff existing as logically possible and thats some kind of wild pure information large cardinal hypertopos math beyond human math of true infinity something but surely as large as our formal logic can 'see'...
[08:35:23] <mycroftiv> and some information structure within that have the characteristic of computational iterative self-optimizing replication
[08:36:49] <mycroftiv> ultimately it all has to boil down to the informational light cone we experience and can conduct repeatable measurements on ourselves as observers
[08:37:01] <mycroftiv> as our 'local experiential weather' of this larger space
[08:41:03] <mycroftiv> with a provisional perspective that about the way things seem to us has to represent a kind of 'average world' of the multiverse and Inhabited Evolutionary Lifespheres of various kinds and scales predominate

[23:10:09] <arryana> puppy is always a good word
[23:10:39] <arryana> my friend whose rescue greyhound died a couple of weeks ago put in his application for another rescue greyhound
[23:10:46] <arryana> he's just waiting for the right one
[23:11:47] <Blankspace17> hmm

[23:16:06] <arryana> heya lumi
[23:16:11] <Lumine> Hi arryana
[23:16:18] <arryana> he still has a second rescue that he got a few years after the first
[23:16:26] <arryana> but that one is too timid and shy to go on walks alone
[23:17:19] <arryana> the first had a hard story, the second had a brutal one.  he was a blood donor, he lived most of his life in an old plastic barrel and was drained once a week.

[23:17:40] <arryana> when he first came to my friend, he couldn't focus more than 18 inches in front of his face, and couldn't walk more than ten feet at a time.
[23:18:00] <arryana> he still has seizures, but he's a happy dude, and he's recovered remarkably
[23:18:36] <arryana> he needs a greyhound companion, though.
[23:18:54] <pussipupu> horrific :'(
[23:20:42] <arryana> fortunately, he's amazingly resilient
[23:20:49] <arryana> he even runs a little these days
[23:20:57] <Blankspace17> he is a person or a dog
[23:21:07] <arryana> all his fur has grown back, and even his scars aren't obvious
[23:21:43] <arryana> it's been... almost three years my friend has had him
[23:24:05] <jeffre> arryana: sorry, thought it would be obvious, it's a thought experiment.  I don't have amnesia.
[23:24:34] <arryana> lies are not good thought experiements.
[23:24:45] <jeffre> You have an interesting definition of lie.
[23:25:04] <arryana> you made a claim that is patently untrue.  that's a lie
[23:25:24] <jeffre> sigh
[23:25:41] <dTal> what if the person believes it to be true, is that a lie
[23:26:05] <jeffre> It's a philosophy channel.  ... No, your belief doesn't make my statement a lie.  The lie definition depends on my belief.
[23:26:07] <arryana> clearly he doesn't, or he would not have amended his original claim.  so i don't see the point of that question.
[23:27:01] <jeffre> Wait, is this serious?  You think I told a lie?  [serious question]
[23:27:04] <dTal> arryana: it was clearly a thought experiment
[23:29:08] <audrey> What's going on out there? Nuclear war in a few weeks, probably, hmm.
[23:31:18] <Delf> Nuclear extinction, not war
[23:31:37] <jeffre> sigh again.  On that topic, I just read chpt 2 of Freedman & Michaels `Evolution of Nuclear Strategy', which convinced me that anyone who has a simple explanation for a nuclear strategy or choice is just uninformed.  Chpt 2 is on the Hiroshima decision.
[23:32:37] <jeffre> Spoiler: There are no obvious villains, only a lot of different ideas and personalities trying to achieve the least bad outcome.
[23:32:42] <jeffre> Presumably that's true today.
