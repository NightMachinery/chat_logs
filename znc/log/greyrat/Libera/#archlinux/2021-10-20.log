[05:55:52] <gimmel> Hi all, I'm hoping for some help troubleshooting a new install that won't load X. I've pacman -S'd xorg plasma plasma-wayland-session kde-applications. I've enabled sddm and NetworkManager via systemctl. When I try to boot the system hangs at "Reached target Graphical Interface". I've added amdgpu to /etc/mkinitcpio.conf. My Xorg log file contains errors loading the amdgpu, ati, modesetting, fbdev and

[08:44:31] <cnsvc> hi - i'm having issues with openssh after recent upgrades. ssh to servers fails and says 'sign_and_send_pubkey: no mutual signature supported'. Tried to reenable rsa key type but it still doesn't work. Any idea"
[08:45:18] <grawity> tried to reenable it how exactly
[08:45:51] <cnsvc> I tried put this 'PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-rsa' in my host section
[08:45:57] <grawity> there are two separate options you might need, one for accepting the server's Hostkey signatures, and one for making your own Pubkey signatures
[08:46:05] <grawity> some servers need both, others one

[08:46:53] <grawity> when the server is sending *you* an ssh-rsa signature for its host key, that's HostkeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa
[08:46:54] <cnsvc> i suppose the second is 'HostKeyAlgorithms ssh-dss'
[08:47:15] <grawity> ...or that, but really prefer enabling ssh-rsa, that's a lot "less bad" than ssh-dss

[16:09:04] <currybullen> WhyNotHugo: because some commands such as `systemctl` checks those variables to decide which editor to use. also i think it doesn't run in a shell environment, so anything inside the root users .bashrc won't take effect
