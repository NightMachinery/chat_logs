[05:53:52] <simcop2387> pabs3: you could do: push @options, $config{FOO} || (); but that's also needlessly obtuse
[05:54:26] <pabs3> in this situation that does work actually
[05:54:31] <pabs3> thanks
[05:57:48] <simcop2387> dojng code golfa is about the onlh reason to do that
[05:57:53] <simcop2387> golfs*
[05:59:17] <emanuele6> you probably want `//' instead of `||'
[06:00:03] <simcop2387> emanuele6: not based on his original code, he was testing for truthiness not defined-ness
[06:00:13] <emanuele6> ah, right
[06:00:22] <simcop2387> but it is usually the kind of thing you should cknsider
[06:00:31] <simcop2387> bag=h jard to type in tablet
[06:01:14] <emanuele6> if you wanted   `push @options, $config{FOO} // ();'   without checking the truthy-ness of $config{FOO}, you could have use a for/foreach
[06:01:26] <emanuele6> like:   push @options, $_ for ($config{FOO});
[06:02:57] <simcop2387> yea there's many ways to do it
[06:03:23] <emanuele6> that's how it works :)
[06:03:48] <simcop2387> if you rename @options, the shortest way is @o=(@o,$config{FOO}||());

[15:42:33] <The_Blode> Good afternoon guys. Quick question.
[15:42:50] <The_Blode> strftime "%m", localtime; produces 12.
[15:43:00] <The_Blode> However, what would be produced if it was on the hour?

[15:45:45] <lopid> "The month as a decimal number (range 01 to 12)."
[15:45:47] <simcop2387> The_Blode: it'll be the same as whatever the platform strftime does, which usually would be 00 and such for that.  see man strftime

[19:58:58] <aquanight> LeoNerd/mst/anyone else really: what's different about OPf_WANT_{VOID,SCALAR,LIST} vs G_{VOID,SCALAR,ARRAY}? They appear to be at least defined as the same.
[20:00:58] <jpmh> I have a VERY simple scrit, https://l.perl.bot/p/87leoa - it uses get() from LWP::Simple and curl inside backticks to get the same url.  The collected data is short, 1 line of 1129 characters.  I expected the get() to be uch faster since it did not need to invoke a shell.  It is 8 times slower.  This is on a Raspberry Pi zero,  What am I missing?

[20:09:25] <aquanight> all RPIs?
[20:09:36] <xenu> LWP::Simple isn't recommended, btw, for unrelated reasons: it has no error handling
[20:09:37] <jpmh> it just seems incoceivable that it is doing so much that it is slower than loadin the shell etc .
[20:10:27] <jpmh> xenu: for what I need it seemed the perfect solution though because it is SO simple and I am just getting status from various devices on the LAN
[20:10:30] <xenu> HTTP::Tiny, Mojo::UserAgent or even LWP::UserAgent are all better options
[20:11:09] <aquanight> huh cant' say I would've expected LWP to be PP
[20:11:33] <xenu> mojo::useragent is probably the most powerful and the most easy to use of them all
[20:12:01] <jpmh> xenu: testing HTTP::Tiny right now - TY
[20:12:18] <aquanight> in any case
[20:12:36] <aquanight> the fact that perlbot shows half the time during get() compared to curl tells me it *has* to be an environmental difference
[20:12:48] <aquanight> different module configuration, different perl configuration, something
[20:13:21] <aquanight> even curl itself might be different somehow. Keep in mind that shells themselves can be pretty quick
[20:14:11] <aquanight> and it might seem like the process of fork > exec shell > shell parses command line > fork > exec again should be slow but modern OSes *should* be good at this process
[20:14:59] <xenu> the fact that perlbot uses non-threaded perl by default, which is significantly faster, may be part of the reason
