[02:46:59] <Z-module> Right: a *general* differentiable F: R^2 -> R^2 , with coordinate functions f, g (so F(x,y) = (f(x,y), g(x,y)) ) has Jacobian matrix  [f_x, f_y ; g_x, g_y]  evaluated at each point. If F is actually C -> C and holomorphic, where f = Re(F), g = Im(F), then this matrix is more specialized since it is  [f_x, f_y ; -f_y, f_x]  by Cauchy-Riemann.
[02:49:24] <[itchyjunk]> hmmmmmmm
[02:50:10] <johnkeats6> to first order, a holomorphic f dilates by |f'(z)| and rotates by arg f'(z) near z. this is an interesting geometric perspective, e.g. it makes the open mapping theorem intuitive

[05:15:47] <ThoughtPhreaker> so where I'm at right now is I've established P(t) = 3/(60 - t), and Q(t) = 2. I(t) is the integral of e^P(x), which gets you (60 - t)^-3
[05:16:31] <ThoughtPhreaker> and so for x(t), you're getting 1/I(t) times the integral of Q(t) * I(t)
[05:16:40] <ThoughtPhreaker> which ultimately gets you (60 - t)
[05:16:49] <ThoughtPhreaker> and as far as I can tell, that *seems* right
[05:17:15] <ThoughtPhreaker> according to the demonstration of someone else doing the problem though, there's a little more to it
[05:17:18] <ThoughtPhreaker> https://i.imgur.com/S6cos07.png
[05:17:35] <ThoughtPhreaker> so my question is, why are you subtracting the constant, and where'd the (60 - t)^3 come from?
[05:18:10] <ThoughtPhreaker> I assume there's some rule I'm just not accounting for
[05:20:42] <buster> you could add the constant, and then you'd find C=-1/3600. it won't make a difference. And the (60-t)³ comes from multiplying both sides by (60-t)³.

[06:40:07] <somiaj> 2 = n^(log_n(2)), so 2^(log_3(n)) = (n^(log_n(2)))^log_3(n) = n^(log_n(2) * log_3(n)) = ... from there log_3(n) = log_n(n)/log_n(3)
[06:40:48] *** Joins: texasmusicinstru (~Rheanna@101.91.192.124)
[06:41:44] <somiaj> so that gives n^(log_n(2)/log_n(3)) = n^(log_3(2)) by change of base again.
[06:43:53] <Guest6> I'm trying to write something that explains something quite mathematical for a non-mathematical audience, and I'm kind of stuck between intuitive notions of projections and technical ones.
[06:44:14] <Guest6> So, here's a question
[06:44:39] <Guest6> Usually, a projection is defined as V -> V
[06:45:27] <Guest6> But, in most applications, when something is a projection, you only care about the span of the projection
[06:45:57] <Kaedenn> I don't quite get how to write (n^(log_n(2)))^log_3(n) as n^(log_n(2)*log_3(n))
[06:47:16] <Kaedenn> I get that exponentials drop to multiplication, but...
[06:47:17] <Guest6> so, you would go from a point described by n coordinates, to one described by some number less than n
[06:48:47] <Guest6> you would have a mapping from one vector space to another space, not a mapping to the same space
[06:49:06] <somiaj> Kaedenn: (a^b)^c = a^(b*c)
[06:49:32] <somiaj> Guest6: Might depend on your goal, I like the shadow approach
[06:49:34] <Guest6> making the definitions of projections as idempotent operations not very useful
[06:49:52] <somiaj> though this is more limited to say projections onto a single vector, vs onto a subspace
[06:50:51] *** Joins: LiftLeft (~LiftLeft@172.98.92.52)
[06:50:55] <somiaj> Or start out with easy examples, like projecting (a,b,c) onto one of the axis is just (0,b,0) for instance, and from there talk about well what about projecting onto the xy-plane, or maybe projecting onto an arbtiary vector, then an arbitary plane
[06:51:04] <somiaj> I think visualizations will help out a lot

[08:41:30] <brownorange> but it would see mto me what iv'e described is a program. so how could all programs be produced?

[08:42:29] <brownorange> also if some programs don't halt, then i'm not sure what it would mean to say all outputs of all programs could be produced
[08:42:40] <mornfall> there's no contradiction
[08:43:16] <W> a program can produce itself, it even has a name, a quine
[08:43:27] <mornfall> you can't enumerate all programs in finite time
[08:44:02] <mornfall> you might be looking for the distinction between recursive and recursively enumerable
[08:44:14] <brownorange> yes
[08:45:05] <mornfall> (though the set of all natural numbers is regular; but it's probably not what you had in mind)
[08:45:40] <mornfall> (co-finite even, the almost simplest set in terms of computability that you can come up with)

[08:46:36] <brownorange> yet I can think of no better way then this counting process
[08:47:52] <mornfall> what is a halting program?
[08:48:18] <brownorange> a program which halts, is a halting program.
[08:48:32] <mornfall> on some input? all inputs? a specific input?
[08:48:59] <W> it depends on what you mean by "we had"; if a process outputs all possible programs, the process necessarily also produce any subset of possible programs, such as all programs that halt
[08:50:41] <brownorange> then it would seem comparing proofs and programs doesn't really work
[08:51:02] <mornfall> in asmuch as a digital scan of a botticelli painting is a natural number (which is easily arranged), you also enumerate all possible scans of all botticelli paintings… the problem is telling them from the rest of the natural numbers
[08:51:53] <brownorange> when all encodings are produceable then i believe interpretation doesn't matter

[09:00:26] <mornfall> W: hmm? you can generate all the correct proofs in an inference system
[09:01:08] <mornfall> brownorange: no it's not; it has to be the exact set, not an arbitrary superset
[09:03:18] <mornfall> W: you can do even better, you can decide whether a given input is a correct proof; that's the whole point of proofs
[09:04:32] <mornfall> what you usually can't do is decide whether a given statement is _true_ (which is different from provable, in general)
[09:05:01] <brownorange> @mornfall but addition would easily produce so many proofs and non-proofs. but it's a matter of interpretation of the numbers
[09:05:16] <brownorange> let's say we had a godel encoding for our formulas
[09:05:59] <mornfall> brownorange: the interpretation has to be mechanical (otherwise, we are talking castles in the sky)
[09:06:13] <mornfall> the mechanical interpretation is a turing machine, or whatever formalism you prefer
[09:07:46] <brownorange> this may sound crazy to ask. but godel's own encoding is complete right? that is every encoded formula is provable or not provable as being a wff of math?
[09:07:53] <mornfall> a turing machine can tell proofs from non-proofs, but it can't tell truth from non-truth (in a sufficiently strong theory); positing a machine which could do that leads to contradictions

[09:38:15] <mornfall> but each branch of mathematics has its own ‘high level’ language

[09:42:01] <mornfall> (especially considering that programming languages are a small part of math, in this context)
[09:42:09] <brownorange> mornfall, your point appears to be you don't need to assume the entire system, and can work from a lesser one to study some other part of math. that's nice. but when you provide THE formalization for math, you suffer THE incompleteness thereof
[09:42:49] <W> there is no such suffering
[09:42:54] <mornfall> maybe incompleteness means something else than you imagine?
[09:42:56] <nagefire> brownorange why is incompleteness so bad?
[09:43:06] <W> mathematicians generally don't bump into the incompleteness theorem, they have to actively seek it out
[09:43:11] <nagefire> if anything, it lends credibility to math
[09:43:19] <mornfall> because all that it means is that there are true statements that cannot be proved
[09:43:39] <nagefire> and that is a problem why?
[09:43:44] <mornfall> which is perhaps unfortunate, but we can live with it

[09:46:24] <brownorange> @mornfall if you argue for incompleteness because it makes math exciting or worth doing, then i'm telling you that's not an objective reason.

[09:46:59] <brownorange> @W you're making my point
[09:47:13] <W> brownorange, so why are you talking about incompleteness again?
[09:47:28] <brownorange> mornfall some will say that the expressiveness of math is owed to the incompleteness or vice versa

[10:24:42] <nagefire> brownorange too big, incompleteness comes up so infrequently that I would compare it more to a bacteria
[10:25:55] <PlanckWalk> Provable consistency is a mirage.  There are always reasonable doubts about whether a system is consistent.
[10:26:02] <mornfall> (from the sidelines: bacteria come up all the time)
[10:26:14] <yVk3PteV> I have been thinking about how one might represent irrational numbers in a computer or system.  It is possible to represent at least some of irrational numbers, but how many and within what bounds?

[10:27:02] <PlanckWalk> (Or even believe that they accurately represent consistency properties accurately)
[10:27:22] <brownorange> PlanckWalk there is no principled reason to embrace potholes, they are not artifacts of a great mathematical adventure, fighting a dragon is what's important. the theorem that is proved is a challenge worth facing

[10:31:18] <PlanckWalk> Unless you're a farmer who needs fertilizer perhaps.
[10:31:33] <nagefire> brownorange you're arguing that we should do away with roads because inevitably potholes are produced
[10:31:35] <yVk3PteV> There might be varying degrees of consistency.  Obviously, some mathematical problems and solutions are more general while others are more specific.
[10:31:36] <W> people generally also don't do mathematics for the thrill, certainly not the thrill of perils to the goal they seek
[10:31:43] <brownorange> yes but would you want to cross fields of shit forever because you like something on the otherside? just remove the field of shit (if possible)
[10:32:13] <mornfall> oh god what did i do
[10:32:59] <brownorange> nagefire roads are useful and hopefully thought out. potholes are not to be idealized. math is not like reality. we don't need to settle if we don't have to

[11:36:27] <mornfall> isn't it a theorem of ZF (no C) that countable sets can be well-ordered though?
[11:36:32] <brownorange> Thankyou everyone! This conversation has actually been quite productive. I can stop wasting my energy on metamathematics and just focus on disproving statements like "there are infinite number of primes"

[11:40:52] <PlanckWalk> Welllll, again depending upon exactly what you mean by "countable"
[11:41:11] <PlanckWalk> Also, having countably many sets doesn't mean that each set is countable.
[11:41:34] <PlanckWalk> But these are minor issues since it's not even provable that a union of countably many countable sets is countable.
[11:41:46] <mornfall> it doesn't; anti-choice doesn't say anything about how the un-choicable system looks, just that there is one
[11:44:15] <PlanckWalk> There are lots of anti-choice propositions
[11:44:16] <mornfall> which is why i have my doubts that you can arrange the tree such that the neighbourhood sets form a system without a choice function

[13:37:39] <riv> oh ok
[13:37:45] <riv> well take gcd(84,70)

[13:37:58] <riv> that is 14
[13:37:59] <cart_man> I have a fraction here... They say 84/70 becomes 6/5

[13:38:05] <cart_man> Gwad

[13:38:19] <cart_man> I should have seen that
[13:38:24] <cart_man> 70 -84 = 14
[13:38:31] <cart_man> at least give it a try
[13:38:33] <cart_man> -14`
[13:38:34] <riv> you could also solve this by factoring 70 and checking all the divisors
[13:38:36] <Koen> cart_man: 84 = 70+14 = 7*10 + 7*2 = 7*12 = 14*6
[13:38:39] <riv> 70 = 7 * 2 * 5
[13:39:03] <riv> so just check 7, 2 and 5 only 7 and 2 work. so 7*2 is the biggest number
[13:39:45] <cart_man> Well I would have usually minusd the biggest from the smallest and chekc if I cna divide with the difference. Usually works but I haven;t done math in 5 or so years soo

Now I add 1 to both side to get 11^{104}+1 = 17x + 17. This means that 11^{104} when divided by 17 does not leaves remainder 0 so it is not divisible by 17 ??
[18:10:24] <[-_-]> lets just say the coefficients differ between the 2nd and 3rd equations
[18:10:28] <mefistofeles> I mean, don't expect to be taught something like differential calculus (even without DEs) in a 4-month course. This is something that took geniuses their whole life (Newton, Leibnitz, etc.)
[18:10:35] <buster> [-_-]: you can understand f(x(t),t) as f(x(s),t(s)) where t(s)=s (t is the identity function). Then it doesn't look so special
[18:10:37] <mefistofeles> that is, with great detail
[18:10:42] <int-e> kobalt: what is 17x + 17 divided by 17?
[18:11:08] <[-_-]> but yeah....but I wanted an explicit description

[18:11:33] <[-_-]> I as a student is dumb and want the writer to assume that I will be dumb
[18:11:54] <biberao> (x^2)/2-x+1 is a solution to f'(x)+f''(x)=x
[18:11:57] <[-_-]> but what I want doesn't matter, it should have been there
[18:12:09] <mefistofeles> [-_-]: you cannot be reinventing or relearning the basics every time, they authors have a deadline and get tired as well :P
[18:12:10] <kobalt> I assumed x to be some integer that might satisfy the equation 11^{104} = 17x +16 as 11^{104} mod 17 = 16.

[18:12:49] <int-e> kobalt: but you should still answer that question
[18:12:55] <[-_-]> mefistofeles: but I did not know x depends on t, for an wave equation it doesn't, iirc
[18:13:01] <mefistofeles> [-_-]: and sure, never use or trust a single source, always use many
[18:13:07] <[-_-]> hmmm
[18:13:16] <kobalt> int-e: oh it is x+1
[18:13:26] <mefistofeles> [-_-]: x of course depends on t, x is position
[18:13:29] <int-e> kobalt: right. without remainder.
[18:13:51] <[-_-]> mefistofeles: x is position but doesn't depend on t, iirc
[18:13:52] <kobalt> yes
[18:14:13] <mefistofeles> [-_-]: no, it does, if it didn't then position wouldn't change

[18:15:25] <kobalt> oh I see. 11^{104}+1 = 17x+17 which is divisible by 17.
[18:15:39] <int-e> kobalt: Of course involving x isn't required; you can just write 17 = 0 (mod 17), or 16 = -1 (mod 17).

[18:35:32] <kobalt> I think. Noise is fixed to 30dB on LHS, on RHS 10 is a constant and only S/N can vary. The only value of S/N to make the log value 3 should be 1000
[18:36:04] <int-e> The 10 is from the "deci" in "decibel"... rather than dividing the LHS by 10, we multiply the RHS by 10.

[18:50:45] <HisShadow> well, not exactly, any function over [-pi, pi] can be continued periodically and it's fourier series computed
[18:51:12] <KotH> that's what i mean
[18:51:15] <riv> there is a gap in the market here
[18:51:41] <KotH> and because that limits the function quite severely, fourier series are usually not tabulated
[18:52:16] <KotH> at least, i have not seen any tables in any engineering literature of otherwise
[18:52:48] <KotH> maybe my highschool textbook had a few listed... but i'm not 100% sure anymore
[18:53:54] <HisShadow> I know for a fact that a guy looked into one and found fourier series for Pi/2Sinh(Pi) * cosh(x) over (-Pi, Pi), but he doesn't mention the book :(
[18:58:41] <KotH> well, that is not to hard to calculate if you know that cosh(x) = (e^x + e^-x)/2
[18:59:40] <KotH> put this into your fourier series formula and you get an integral over e^(something) which is easy to solve

[22:52:34] <extern> right
[22:52:36] <extern> that's what confuses me
[22:52:55] <extern> so why the book says that we can deduce that they are equal ?
[22:53:06] <cherim> Clearly the answer is always odd since all even people get killed in the first round
[22:53:22] <cherim> Can you state the contradiction more clearly?
[22:53:37] <cherim> J(5 * 2^m) = 2^{m+1} + 1 looks correct to me
[22:53:44] <cherim> For all m>=0
[22:53:56] <extern> right
[22:54:08] <extern> not =
[22:54:09] <extern> but >
[22:54:29] <cherim> For m=0 it says J(5)=3. What is the true J(5)?
[22:54:33] <extern> in this example there can't be 0 since someone has to survive :D
[22:54:36] <extern>  thanks cherim
[22:55:05] <extern> like you said for m > 0

[23:08:08] <brownorange> It would be nice if mathematicians and logicians met twice a year to discuss Godel's theorems. There should be conventions on this. I'm still confused on what was the method and what was the result
[23:09:20] <brownorange> for example is math's ability to talk about itself only demonstrated at the metamath level, or is it now understood math itself really talks about itself?

[23:16:11] <phasmatodea> yeah they already have maths conventions
[23:16:35] <phasmatodea> the people working in specific subfields tend to stay pretty updated on what their colleagues are working on anyway
[23:17:19] <brownorange> "He also showed that no candidate set of axioms can ever prove its own consistency."  This is exactly why I kept bringing up the need to separating proof system from the formalization of math
[23:17:24] <phasmatodea> not hard when it takes years to formulate a novel proof
[23:18:10] <joel135> Math develops along with the humans. You can't bound mathematics any more than you can bound evolution, and neither can you predict it.
[23:18:27] <brownorange> phasmatodea it's about general public understanding and there seems to be too much confusion even coming from professors on what the metamath results really mean
