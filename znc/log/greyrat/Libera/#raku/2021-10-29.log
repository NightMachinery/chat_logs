[00:50:29] <melezhik> so if someone would help me test that I'd appreciate ... 
[00:52:48] <El_Che> if you accept my terrible comment: the colours, my eyes
[00:53:12] <melezhik> you can change to light theme ...
[00:53:16] <melezhik> there is the link
[00:54:08] <El_Che> better
[00:54:32] <El_Che> isn't black as a default a weird choice?
[00:55:19] <El_Che> anyway, lots of people like black teams probably
[00:55:21] <melezhik> black?
[00:55:26] <El_Che> black
[00:55:37] <El_Che> dark
[00:55:41] <melezhik> ah ... I see now
[00:55:59] <El_Che> the version of a site with dark colours that makes it unreadable :)
[00:56:06] <melezhik> yes you are right my recent commit made dark theme is default
[00:56:33] <melezhik> lets run a poll? :') 
[00:56:49] <El_Che> I have collegues that use a browser plugin to make everything dark theme
[00:57:04] <El_Che> only a few, though
[00:57:16] <melezhik> I have a bunch of questions I would like to ask about people about mybfio design/UX , maybe create a post somehow ...
[00:57:33] <melezhik> "I have collegues that use a browser plugin to make everything dark theme" oh , :') 
[00:58:00] <melezhik> it's not I like the dark theme very much, I just think it looks slightly better then light
[00:58:28] <El_Che> it literally tires my eyes
[00:58:42] <melezhik> it's hard to decide - basically I am limited by https://jenil.github.io/bulmaswatch/ 
[00:58:42] <El_Che> to much contrast I think
[00:59:18] <melezhik> i can even make it configurable though UI - so a user choose form all of them
[00:59:22] <melezhik> I see ...
[00:59:26] <melezhik> thanks for feedback
[01:01:25] <El_Che> it's not a nice one and very subjective one, but better be honest
[01:01:45] <El_Che> I am pretty sure others love the dark theme
[01:45:01] <japhb> El_Che, melezhik: Dark themes are necessary for people who get visual migraines.  Surrounding light levels matter for that as well; at my previous company, we had the maintenance teams turn off some of the overhead lighting banks to allow for intentional darker areas.  On the flip side, we had team members who really needed bright surroundings, and always took the window seats and bright overhead lights.

[14:12:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @lizmat No, it is on a Intel-processor MacBook Pro.
[14:13:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @E_Che I tried `homebrew` — I can run Raku. I cannot do much software development with it. (On macOS Monterey.)
[14:16:30] <lizmat> Anton Antonov: perhaps start with gisting the output of `perl Configure.pl --gen-moar` ?
[14:17:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @lizmat Ok. I will try that. (Later today.)
[14:18:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> I have to say I see these problems as my fault — I should have not rushed upgrading to macOS Monterey…
[14:38:44] <El_Che> Can't upu install zef from homebrew of kickstarted with the homebrew raku?
[14:41:40] <lizmat> Anton Antonov: fwiw, I've come to the conclusion I won't upgrade MacOS anymore
[14:42:06] <lizmat> after Catalina destroyed all of my videos / audio workflows
[14:42:34] <lizmat> so the one machine I had upgraded, I had to downgrade to Mojave at great expense and weeks of work  :-(

[15:00:10] <El_Che> lizmat: how did an OS update do that? They killed previously bundled applications?
[15:04:41] <lizmat> killed iPhoto for one
[15:04:48] <lizmat> and with no viable upgrade path
[15:05:15] <lizmat> they *do* provide an upgrade path, but after it had been busy on my photo database for a **WEEK**, I killed the orocess
[15:05:35] <lizmat> and that was the 3rd try
[15:06:24] <El_Che> I read they introduces an app called photos
[15:07:17] <lizmat> yes, and the conversion program does not run to completion :-(
[15:07:57] <lizmat> so: iPhoto is capable of handling my photo database (20+ years of *many* pictures), but Photos is not
[15:08:13] <lizmat> I'm sure it has many nice new features  :-(
[15:08:24] <lizmat> yes, I'm disappointed in Apple

[15:23:50] <lizmat> well, I would understand that it could take a long time to convert
[15:24:07] <lizmat> but after a week it just sits around doing nothing (0.1% CPU)
[15:24:26] <lizmat> so I guess the conversion program gets in some sort of deadlock and never recovers

[15:36:19] * [Coke] is reminded to update https://github.com/coke/scripts/blob/master/sw_hist so he can double check and say "I'm only on 11.x, sorry"
[15:37:48] <[Coke]> I was one of several people pondering getting an updated mac, but it's a huge investment cost and I'm not feeling great about it. (liz's story a contributing factor)
[15:39:52] <lizmat> yeah, for the first time in ~20 years, I'm seriously considering not having an MBP for my next notebook
[15:45:01] <jast> there's a lot of value in using open source software for this kind of thing (if the software in question covers your use case, which isn't always a small "if")...
[15:49:14] <lizmat> jast: yes, I was going for convenience...  
[15:49:26] <lizmat> if you want something done well, you have to do it yourself  :-)
[15:49:40] <jast> true way too often, unfortunately
[15:49:41] <andinus> SmokeMachine: that works, thank you :)
[15:51:35] <[Coke]> lizmat: did you see the new mbp has the notch in the menu bar for the camera (like the 11 model iphone) and things render behind the camera?
[15:51:52] <El_Che> I saw rending beneath
[15:51:57] <El_Che> menus and the like
[15:52:02] <lizmat> no
[15:52:30] <lizmat> won't be looking at a new notebook until sometime next year anyway
[15:54:26] <El_Che> my main machine is a linux, but the mac I have for testing stuff is getting slow (air)
[15:54:45] <El_Che> I thought, let's try to get a mbp 16
[15:54:50] <El_Che> and then I saw the notch
[15:55:28] <El_Che> I know it would bother me to no end
[15:55:30] <ugexe> they must have assumed everyone puts tape there anyway

[16:35:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> El_Che I tried the jump start from Big Sur partition of my laptop -- worked to a point. I will try jump start using `homebrew` installations.
[16:56:10] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> El_Che I agree the notch on new MacBoo Pros is a deal breaker.
