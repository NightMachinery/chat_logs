[00:38:34] <systemfault> And you wouldn't say that to people looking at their instagram/facebook feed for hours...
[00:39:06] <systemfault> I totally understand your point if someone would make "real commits" every day for 8 years.
[00:39:14] <systemfault> "real code"
[00:39:52] <ljharb> my streak is fine
[00:40:07] <ljharb> tcsc: and it’s insanely inappropriate for someone to tell anyone else what’s unhealthy.
[00:40:15] <tcsc> eh fair enough

[00:46:22] <tcsc> that said, you're right that it's out of line. i don't think i'd phrase it like that to a coworker, or probably say anything at all unless it was clearly impacting them (or we were close, which ofc we aren't)
[00:46:24] <tcsc> i think part of my concern is that people look up to you, and might think that kind of thing is expected or what they should be doing
[00:46:54] <tcsc> anyway what test framework should i be using these days. i just need some simple unit tests.
[00:46:59] <ljharb> sure, but that's a risk no matter *what* i do

[00:47:41] <ljharb> tcsc: for test frameworks, i tell people to use jest for apps, and tape for packages
[00:47:51] <tcsc> tape then
[00:47:58] <ljharb> jest because it's got the nicest DX, and tape because it's the only testing framework left that maintains back compat with older engines
[00:48:06] <RLa> any reason to not use mocha?
[00:48:28] <ljharb> RLa: jest's nicer to use than mocha, but tbh i'd use chai with both
[00:48:48] <ljharb> RLa: mocha's not bad at all, it's just BDD-style (which isn't great), not as good as jest, and doesn't have any back compat like tape does
[00:48:48] <RLa> I think that parallel tests are harder with mocha
[00:48:57] <ljharb> parallelization is def somewhere jest shines
[00:49:02] <RLa> since jest is parallel/concurrent by default
[00:49:05] <RLa> yeah
[00:49:10] <ljharb> but also, if a project *needs* parallelism then that's a warning sign :-)

[01:46:54] <tcsc> it also has some great advice, such as that you should base things on the minimum execution time, rather than the average execution time, since the min time will tend to be the time where you didn't get hit with a gc or get scheduled or whatever.

[02:43:32] <ramblebamble> onosendi, yes I did, i fear I am onto something strange, again, mind you I am not a JS developer by profession. I always manage to want to develop s.th. and then hit a roadblock like this without my doing, I also deleted the cache, etc. I am currently checking the assumption that yarn might be at fault here, yarn version is different between my local setup and the docker-image builing and
[02:43:33] <ramblebamble> hosting it

[02:45:29] <ramblebamble> Nope yarn is not it.
[02:47:35] <ramblebamble> onosendi, I have the same code-base,I build it locally(arch, yarn 1.22.17), the components are not put where they are supposed to go, I build it inside a docker-container(debian, yarn 1.22.0) and the components are placed exactly where they are supposed to go -.-'
[02:49:25] <onosendi> Hmm. Try downgrading yarn locally?
[02:49:55] <ramblebamble> yes
[02:50:07] <ramblebamble> could also be that it is the underlying node-version
[02:50:11] <ramblebamble> Will check that next

[14:11:51] <hassoon> given this silmple nodejs code that just runs the webserver with some few conditions, https://paste.debian.net/1225569/, but the server crashes when i enter a random url intended to trigger the last res.end() instruction https://paste.debian.net/1225570/
[14:11:57] <hassoon> * this simple *
[14:13:19] <alystair> the biggest pain I'm dealing with at the moment is coding sane <template> handling, once that's done I feel it's good enough for an initial release after a few additional housekeeping chores
[14:13:48] <hassoon> <template> ? like a custom element ?
[14:14:33] <theskillwithin> hassoon why aren't you setting 404 header, and why are you using res.end idk if thats normal?
[14:15:29] <alystair> <template> is a native HTML5 tag, I'm using it as the basis for repeatable DOM elements

[14:36:31] <paulcarroty> but wiped 1Tb+ video courses collection in result
[14:41:31] <alystair> I like written word + byte-sized code samples most, I have no patience for most videos
[14:42:27] <theskillwithin> I really like Wes Bos,  his video courses are really nice
[14:44:28] <paulcarroty>  @theskillwithin, I'm not "blaming" all, just saying they aren't effective and heavily promoted.

[18:08:01] <austincheney> That is the thing that stuck out to me most when I was interviewing this year... In JavaScript the only barrier to entry is leet code, AWS, and a bunch of tools.  Skills and API experience never came up (except if you count leet code as a skill)
[18:08:49] <austincheney> There was no mention of Node APIs, DOM, browser media APIs and I went on a bunch of interviews
[18:08:54] <austincheney> it was pretty telling
[18:09:40] <austincheney> most of the time if React was a center of the interview the interviewer had just enough skill in JS to barely write some declarative logic for React

[18:16:59] <austincheney> the only reason I was interviewing is because I thought it was inevitable I would have to return to the office with no options to ever work from home, but the mandate to return has evaporated as Covid has revamped.  My final thoughts are that I should be comfortable being a bored senior developer instead of wasting my time writing a bunch of beginner code with less job security even if I am potentially missing a 50%

[18:33:22] <Simplar> why could axios.get hang out of nowhere on a valid request?
[18:34:12] <austincheney> Simplar, because its not getting a response
[18:34:28] <austincheney> and because there is not a TTL or timeout set on the request
[18:34:40] <Simplar> laravel doesn't care, i think?
[18:34:52] <Simplar> the first instance of the request goes through ok
[18:34:56] <Simplar> the next one goes ew
[18:35:29] <theskillwithin> 90% of the time its CORS problem
[18:35:30] <austincheney> Simplar, then its an application problem on the server.  The request goes through some logic happens (or fails to happen) and no response is sent
[18:38:11] <austincheney> this is a large part of the reason I am adapting my personal application away from http roundtrips.  The result is exchanging transmission complexity for additional services/messaging
[18:38:34] <Simplar> It seems to not reach the endpoint at all

[18:50:48] <austincheney> it looks like your laravel server is running on localhost, so you should be able to log everything directly to the terminal.  you need to be logging directly at the listener for incoming http traffic well before any additional logic
