[00:22:57] <jbis> If I am making a spec for a crypto protocol, is it more confusing to use nonsemantic but unique variable names or semantic duplicated variable names? For example, I have two separate sections that use a nonce. I can represent it by G and H (unique), or N and N (duplicated). 
[00:24:05] <danieldg> maybe N1 and N2?
[00:24:27] <danieldg> or is this too mathy to use long variable names?
[00:24:44] <ioxzev1z> Two chars isn't long lol
[00:24:53] <jbis> It' be easier to use single character names because I am already using super and sub scripts for other things
[00:25:18] <jbis> \mathrm{N1} I *could* do
[00:26:00] <danieldg> N_{client} might be clearer, define by who generates the nonce
[00:31:27] *** Quits: System_Error (~SystemErr@user/systemerror) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[00:31:59] <maroon> sometimes the user of unique names can be confusing - like in OAEP where they have function G and H, which turn out to be the identical function, except they have different pairs of in/out lengths

[00:34:35] <halosghost> the whole point (and name) of a nonce is that it should only be used once
[00:34:43] *** Quits: Leonardzzz (~Administr@114.55.127.80) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[00:34:51] <halosghost> I feel like calling a nonce N for each protocol is most useful
[00:35:11] <halosghost> maybe a footnote on the second use clarifying that nonce-reuse is still a BadIdea™
[00:35:37] <danieldg> jbis: have you also used the pre-subscript and pre-superscript slots?
[00:35:54] <jbis> Hmm. That's an idea.
[00:36:22] <danieldg> then there's the on-the-top and on-the-bottom slot
[00:36:29] <maroon> to clarify, is this the same nonce used 2 places, or it's 2 different nonces used in unrelated ways?

[00:41:11] <maroon> then that doesnt sound like nonce re-use, which would be using the same nonce again the same way
[00:43:47] <halosghost> maroon: to clarify my point, I was suggesting that (presumably), because the protocol isn't suggesting nonce-reuse, the most clear option is to use “N” for any nonce, and either on the second use (or in a paragraph in the section explaining syntax) mention that Ns in different places don't mean they're the same nonce, each N is just “some nonce”

[00:54:26] <jbis> Well it's something
[00:58:01] <riv> "yes this is good notation" they thought to themselves when writing it
[01:00:35] <jbis> maybe i could space it out

[01:02:03] <riv> im sorry
[01:02:18] <riv> this is absolutely awful

[01:02:39] *** Quits: System_Error (~SystemErr@user/systemerror) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[01:02:50] <jbis> A is equal to B
[01:03:08] <riv> so what is (1 = 1, 1 = 2) ?
[01:03:26] <int-e> Yeah, having /client/ and /host/ subscripts for values that are shared by the two parties seems to be a bad choice.
[01:03:39] <jbis> the notation i used was taken from wireguard's spec
[01:03:52] <int-e> :-/
[01:03:57] <jbis> https://www.wireguard.com/papers/wireguard.pdf 5.4.5
[01:04:14] <riv> ok so you're not to blame!
[01:04:38] <jbis> (I'm very new to this so I thought I'd use something generally regarded as good crypto to base my notation off of)
[01:04:48] <jbis> But all ears for suggestions
[01:05:00] <int-e> Yeah the original is as awful as the copy ;)
[01:05:05] <riv> I don't know why he wrote 5.4.5. like that but it sucks
[01:05:48] <riv> I really really don't like this notation
[01:05:48] <jbis> I agree, it took me a good couple minutes to figure out what the hell A = B meant there when I first read it
[01:05:59] <jbis> But i thought that was just inexperience
[01:05:59] *** Joins: Leonardzzz (~Administr@114.55.127.80)
[01:06:06] <int-e> the funny thing is... (A,C) = (B,D) = ...  would work where (A=B,C=D) = ... is just bad.
[01:06:58] <jbis> I think he's trying to convey that the sender and receiver (client and server in my case) generate them separately and they should be the same value
[01:07:44] <riv> I would use := the whole way
[01:07:58] <riv> although I would also not put multiple on a line, really
[01:08:09] <riv> the whole idea of 'pseudocode' is ...
[01:08:10] <int-e> jbis: why do you have host, client, peer, and serv?
[01:08:12] <riv> this is the result

[01:09:18] <int-e> jbis: But I think the left subscripts are the worst offense here, really. They're so uncommon that they're hard to read.
[01:09:24] <jbis> int-e great question, that's a typo. It should be client/host in that section. The section I copied and pasted it from uses peer/server
[01:09:27] <int-e> Two letter variable names would work better.
[01:09:35] <int-e> (I think)
[01:10:01] <int-e> The (A=B,C=D) thing is ugly but the intent is hard to mistake.
[01:10:04] <jbis> I can try N1 but it looked weird
[01:10:19] <int-e> jbis: have you trie NU and NT?
[01:10:45] <int-e> if you do N1 you're probably running into a font problem; \mathit{N1} might look a bit better.
[01:11:04] <int-e> But still odd.
[01:12:32] <int-e> FWIW, notation is always hard.

[01:14:07] <riv> this is actually not a good thing when you're trying to specify crypto protocols etc.
[01:14:10] <riv> absolutely
[01:14:55] <int-e> but real code tends to be cluttered with irrelevant stuff that noone wants to see

[01:15:23] <int-e> then it's not longer real code :P
[01:15:45] <jbis> meh i mean there's no way to denote whats happening on a client and server in the same block in real code
[01:15:51] <jbis> or client and host
[01:16:15] <int-e> yeah, maybe the mistake is trying to specify both sides of the protocol in one chunk
[01:17:54] <int-e> instead of saying what the client does, what the server does, and what values they have in common (which is easy: since provenance of a varible is determined by which side of the protocol you're looking at, you can just drop the client/host subscript for shared values)

[18:29:24] <ms7821> not as you've described it, no
[18:30:25] <ms7821> the point of confirmations is to give people confidence against consensus changing (which in turn prevents double spending)
[18:30:39] <ms7821> any way in which you delay the confirmation delays the ability to have confidence in it
[18:31:57] <ms7821> now maybe we can change the premise of your problem. Perhaps we're not actually solving double spend but want someone to commit money into a "trust", which is something smart contracts can do
[18:34:22] <caveman> what if we pre-confirmations?  e.g. i get confirmations that i freeze X amount of my money, then X becomes the guarantee that, if i ever double-spend, it will be paid from it, plus extra fines.
[18:34:32] <ms7821> or perhaps I don't care about receiving the money but just want to know it was sent somewhere - zero-knowledge stuff could help with that
[18:35:10] <ms7821> but you need to specify exactly what you're trying to do rather than talk about the low-level consensus aspects of a blockchain
[18:36:56] <caveman> i want to use delay-tolerant networks, with mobile phones exxchanging rumours like disease spreads from china to everywhere.  e.g. mobile adhoc network (manet).  this way the currency will work even when internet fails as manet doesn't need established network

[23:30:22] <TimMc> Alipha: I don't think they were specifically suggesting a blockchain.
[23:32:08] <TimMc> caveman: I think digicash is delay-tolerant, but kinda centralized, and operates by revealing the spender's identity if they ever double-spend.

[23:41:06] <Alipha> So, I imagine bitcoin could work, if you add the ability for a block to have multiple parents, to enable various forks to become reunited. I don't think there's security implications with that? I'm not sure how best to incentivize miners to specify multiple parents for their block though. Also, you need some kind of mechanism to ensure that a group of miners aren't just mining off all by themselves for a long
[23:41:08] <Alipha> time without integrating their fork with the main chain. I'm not sure if you can enforce that in the protocol itself, but perhaps just warn people submitting transactions that "hey, this chain doesn't have the miner diversity of blocks that it uses to have 2 weeks ago, and so it appears it hasn't synced with the main chain in a while. It's kit advised to submit transactions here.'
[23:41:51] <Alipha> s/kit/not/
[23:42:18] <TimMc> I believe the lightspeed delay to Mars is long enough that Bitcoin would have some trouble with interplanetary coherence. :-)
[23:42:36] <yawkat> Alipha: you can have transactions that are mutually exclusive on the different chains, and no way to unite them.
[23:42:48] <Platonides> you would have earthchain and marschain
