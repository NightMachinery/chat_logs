[23:33:28] <gerikson> ``America’s politics appear to be stubbornly fixed. That's just a symptom. The bigger problem is the US has a genetic defect that makes it impossible for it to be united. Slavery. Everyone has a position on that. Either for or against. Not too many people in the middle.''
[23:33:47] <gerikson> WTF is a middle position on slavery?!
[23:36:17] <geoffwozniak> Is there a unit test for it?

[23:40:31] <alyx> uh
[23:41:17] <gerikson> I *really* hope there's not a substantial part of the American public that's pro-slavery
[23:43:19] <alyx> i think you'd be surprised
[23:45:35] <geoffwozniak> I'm sure there's a rationalist HN thread waiting to happen that argues a lot more work gets done under slavery, thus productivity is higher and it's good for the economy
