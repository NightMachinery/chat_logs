[00:01:20] <bn_work> tabakhase: yeah, whenever I see that I'm wondering if it's a fallback to some pattern detection vs a virus signature, is their heuristic just falsely flagging VPN kit components in Docker perhaps?

[03:43:54] <larsks> Batzy: this article has one suggestion: https://marcofranssen.nl/nginx-1-19-supports-environment-variables-and-templates-in-docker
[03:44:49] <larsks> Oh, also documented in the official docker image: https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx
[03:44:57] <larsks> Look for "Using environment variables in nginx configuration"

[03:50:26] <Batzy> it's just not working

[03:52:29] <larsks> Batzy: It's just running `envsubst` to generate config files from the templates in the templates directory. If you want to post your configuration somewhere (e.g., Dockerfile and any other files necessary to reproduce the problem) I'd be happy to take a look.
[03:52:47] <Batzy> yeah i actually dont have a dockerfile
[03:53:10] <larsks> So then your `docker run` command, or your `docker-compose.yaml`.

[03:57:41] <larsks> Did you read through the docs in https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx? You need to mount your templates on /etc/nginx/templates, and I don't see you doing that in your docker-compose.yaml. 
[03:57:59] <larsks> Look at the example docker-compose.yaml in those docs.
[03:58:13] <Batzy> well i mean it works if i just hardcode in the domain
[03:58:38] <Batzy> also it claims i should just be able to use env variables!
[03:58:43] <Batzy> in that same doc
[03:58:58] <larsks> In the "Using environment variables in nginx configuration" section, it shows you exactly what you need to do.

[06:00:27] <ash_worksi> MaxLeiter: if not, I would break these two things into different compose files
[06:00:32] <tabakhase> build happen in a whole nother timeline and universe you could say almsot ;-)
[06:01:02] <tabakhase> ash_worksi the entrypoint comment is for you and your secrets/config/env 
[06:01:07] <ash_worksi> MaxLeiter: if it CAN, then poll the server service using `nc` until you can fetch it before continuing to bring up the client
[06:01:15] <ash_worksi> (note, that is not building)
[06:01:27] <ash_worksi> tabakhase: I figured that as I was typing the first response
[06:01:28] <MaxLeiter> im trying to provide this in case people want to use it via docker, so i dont want to have two composes 
[06:01:42] <ash_worksi> tabakhase: but I didn't want to write an entrypoint just to source envvars
[06:01:55] <MaxLeiter> could an entrypoint work? im not familiar with them
[06:02:18] <ash_worksi> MaxLeiter: an entrypoint runs AFTER something is built (when you start the container)
[06:02:40] <MaxLeiter> so you cant use one docker compose to orchestrate something like this? hmmm
[06:02:40] <tabakhase> MaxLeiter depending on "what this is" this may should be a multistage build... but in generall that smells "wrong" on quite a few corners :P - and docker is very opinionated about such things... - maybe eaborate a bit more on what ya doing there...
[06:02:40] <ash_worksi> MaxLeiter: sometimes people use entrypoints to "wait" for another service, for example, an app waiting for a database to be ready
[06:03:50] <ash_worksi> MaxLeiter: but if you refuse to separate the service into another docker-compose file and it MUST be during a build, then I would just recommend putting a note on it telling people to start the containers separately by specifying the server at first
[06:04:08] <tabakhase> "containers waiting for each other" is a whole different thing - there its just about timing --- but builds are isolated to some extend
[06:04:16] <ash_worksi> ie: `docker-compose up -d server; docker-compose up -d`
[06:04:38] <MaxLeiter> well *i* can put the service in another docker compose, but im trying to make this easy for someone to run themselves and afaik most people have one docker-compose?
[06:04:59] <tabakhase> so if anything, publish the port, start the server first, then run the rest of the compose --- and if two compose files is not ok, you can gve the name to start just one first on a "up" and there like
[06:05:37] <tabakhase> and as said, something smells very very wrong there anyhow...
[06:06:12] <MaxLeiter> think of something like a statically generated blog / cms, itll fetch data from the database at build time
[06:06:16] <MaxLeiter> in my case the db is in another container 
[06:06:36] <MaxLeiter> I feel like that should be possible
[06:08:35] <MaxLeiter> ah so 
[06:08:58] <MaxLeiter> `docker-compose up -d server` `docker-compose start server` then do the client the same way
[06:09:39] <tabakhase> where is that db from/filled?
[06:11:16] <tabakhase> or/and if thats you-provided, why they build at all?
[06:13:56] <tabakhase> (to explain that more, - say we use some 3rd party editrial tool then i have a provisioned db i wanne bake files from, cool all makes sense --- but the "fresh start" issue you are describing doesnt exist there --- or if the DB is "part of your repo", and "baking this to image" is the buildjob - the extensive way with "multistage build, that installs what you need, adds mysql ontop, starts a 
[06:13:58] <tabakhase> db, does the generation, then rolls back time to pre-mysql-install, and pulls over the files it "had made before"" is the "dockerish way" i¬¥d guess :P
[06:14:18] <MaxLeiter> tabakhase: the db is in "server" and is managed by the nodejs web server also in "server"
[06:15:01] <MaxLeiter> not sure what you mean by "fresh start" issue, the data should persist

[06:16:48] <tabakhase> q there is "why is there a server container at all?" --- either its kinda its own thing, then its managmenet is out of band anyhow -- or its part of that build, then it should happen in the build and not leave some orphan container :P
[06:17:03] <tabakhase> what of those models fits your case we cant tell ;-)
[06:17:04] *** Joins: dabbill (~dabbill@097-102-250-085.res.spectrum.com)
[06:17:49] <MaxLeiter> its its own thing, so you can hose the front-end on a different provider than the server if you want to 
[06:17:53] <MaxLeiter> host, even
[06:17:58] <MaxLeiter> so two docker composes?
[06:18:26] <MaxLeiter> and have the server one exposed globally, I guess 
[06:18:37] <tabakhase> that be a yes then, are those folders there own git repos or so anyhow?
[06:19:01] <MaxLeiter> no, one repo 
[06:19:19] <MaxLeiter> (although it could be two, although I envisioned them sharing some types)
[06:19:35] <MaxLeiter> https://github.com/maxleiter/drift
[06:19:37] <tabakhase> are you mixing dev & prod there or so...?
[06:19:59] <MaxLeiter> what do you mean
[06:20:11] <MaxLeiter> in this case I only care about docker for production uses
[06:21:27] <tabakhase> cause its not clear how generating some static stuff from a server and building a image fits to dev :P
[06:21:41] <MaxLeiter> incremental generation
[06:21:51] <tabakhase> and looking around a bit in there - i dont even get how you get the idea that something needs to be there "at build"...
[06:22:10] <MaxLeiter> `yarn build` = being built
[06:22:41] <MaxLeiter> if an entry is in the DB a page is built, otherwise it will generate it on the fly when its accessed/created 
[06:22:56] <MaxLeiter> so the front-end, in order to generate the pages, needs the data from the database
[06:23:21] <tabakhase> yarn build and there like in a frontend should compile your js/typescript or whatever to a folder with html&JS you can then serve from a plain nginx or so for max-speed - but totally independend from your actual backend
[06:24:42] <MaxLeiter> im using https://nextjs.org/ so the "frontend" is really a complete webserver 
[06:27:03] <tabakhase> nextjs complicates some of that for sure -.- but doesnt directly change the fundermentals... but pm2 is a later topic yes :P
[06:28:07] <MaxLeiter> I use pm2

[06:32:35] <tabakhase> but well to go back to issue 1, unless you "want to bake something static" you must be mixing up some build/run/generated/usercalls/http/system stuff somewhere -- and pastebin and "static" doesnt sound like it belongs together when noone can add pastes :P (((the "baking" example is more "i have a wordpress, bake me html files" and then in one docker build you shovel up webserver and database 
[06:32:36] <tabakhase> to crawl and then delete it all again :P
[06:32:40] <ash_worksi> what do you normally do in an entrypoint, just `. /run/secrets/{secret_name}` ?
[06:32:45] <MaxLeiter> I think I got it working with `network: host` on client and ports: 3000:3000 on server
[06:33:06] <ash_worksi> MaxLeiter: what static-site-generator are you using?
[06:33:09] <MaxLeiter> nextjs
[06:33:19] <MaxLeiter> tabakhase: static being the pastes that can be fetched from DB when the client is being delpoyed
[06:33:21] <MaxLeiter> deployed*
[06:33:32] <MaxLeiter> so html files are generated
[06:33:48] <tabakhase> ash_worksi common is to suffix env-vars with _FILENAME or such - should even find some "secret puller scripts" that forloop over env; ;D
[06:33:51] <ash_worksi> MaxLeiter: when you say "it fetches data to generate pages at build time", did you mean static site build or docker build?
[06:34:22] <ash_worksi> tabakhase: secret puller secripts?
[06:34:40] <tabakhase> Maxattax hostmode is for running, not building
[06:35:18] <tabakhase> ash_worksi "secret populator entrypoints" - its 3 lines of bash so not like youll find a github - maybe a npm packet tho *giggle*
[06:35:33] <MaxLeiter> static site build, but as far as i understand that happens at docker build (because it happens at `yarn build`)
[06:35:45] <MaxLeiter> https://github.com/MaxLeiter/Drift/blob/main/client/Dockerfile#L24
[06:36:41] <ash_worksi> tabakhase: but it's just like `. /puller-script ${vars[@]}` with contents `for v in "$@"; do export $v; done` ?

[06:39:19] <ash_worksi> do you hardcode your variables?

[06:39:43] <tabakhase> given that YOU are the one producting this image and NEEED to tell others what variables THEY should use in YOUR readme - ofc.
[06:39:49] <ash_worksi> btw, gg = get going, or the old `good game` (meaning "you're done")
[06:39:56] <tabakhase> and if thats an exisitng upstream image, they already did that very thing for me.
[06:40:44] <ash_worksi> tabakhase: I mean, they do(-ish) but that doesn't define the name of the secret file
[06:41:14] <ash_worksi> tabakhase: as in, if you install doctrine, a DATABASE_URL magically appears in your env file
[06:42:03] <tabakhase> if you run things without --no-scripts you deserve that :P
[06:42:09] <ash_worksi> tbh, I was hoping that secrets would just be "available" in the containers environment so I could do `DATABASE_URL='...${pg_pass}...`
[06:42:33] <MaxLeiter> heh so yeah, I guess I just use the hosts network to access API_URL once the servers already running...
[06:42:36] <MaxLeiter> it seems to be working
[06:42:40] <tabakhase> well "secrets" are on the filesystem on purpose as its "More secure"

[06:45:43] <tabakhase> ash_worksi then im not getting what you are trying to say...    your starter was "if my app relies on environment variables OR a file in the format `NAME="value"`, is there a way I can use a docker secret just containing a value in compose?"  -- whats a "no, make a entrypoint that does the translate" - so for the secret DATABASE_PASSWORD you likely want to use DATABASE_PASSWORD_FILENAME and 
[06:45:44] <tabakhase> set that to the default docker secrets path where it would land with that name, and whop, things will magically work be it with env-var OR a secret
[06:47:08] <ash_worksi> tabakhase: I didn't understand that last part.
[06:47:23] <ash_worksi> I have seen the POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE option though
[06:47:41] <ash_worksi> which is nice
[06:47:44] <tabakhase> so, DATABASE_PASSWORD_FILENAME=/run/secrets/DATABASE_PASSWORD or there like --- why the extra filename? cause maybe i want ot use bindmounts and not secrets cause i run podman or whatever stupid reason :P

[06:48:25] <ash_worksi> I mean, I care if I ever want to restart this :P

[17:11:05] <Anticom> dob1: What they're talking about is this https://github.com/mko-x/docker-clamav/blob/master/alpine/main/Dockerfile#L11-L19 (especially the USER directive)
[17:11:12] <kek_> "docker build --build-arg ncpus=$ncpus -t foo ." - I have a script that creates a docker image. I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to docker but this creates an image with no name and no tag. I don't fully understand why.
[17:11:23] <Anticom> dob1: You can read more about it here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#user
[17:11:31] *** Joins: thanas (~thanas@user/thanas)
[17:12:33] <Anticom> kek_: the -t flag is shorthand for --tag and that's the tag it creates at. However as far as I'm aware there *must* be a slash in the tag name since docker is using <vendor>/<image> naming convention (as long as they're supposed to be hosted on docker hub)
[17:12:53] <tabakhase> kek_ sure the build completes succesfully? - should print some "tagging bla bla" line on the end
[17:12:55] <Anticom> kek_: I actually never tried a tag without slash. What does `docker images` give you?
[17:13:03] <tabakhase> and no, no slash needed at all =)
[17:13:10] <Anticom> tabakhase: you learn every day ;)
[17:13:33] <dob1> Anticom, I am fine with this, but it's how it run on the host system my concern, it will run as user with id 101 that is systemd-resolve
[17:13:36] <tabakhase> "-t a" should result in making "t:latest" just fine for example
[17:14:37] <kek_> https://bpa.st/raw/SDNA the second one is succesfull, the first I run out of disk space IIRC. I'm gonna retry but I never saw any errors other than some warnings from the software that got installed

[17:16:45] *** Joins: rageshkrishna (~rageshkri@122.162.198.225)
[17:17:02] <Anticom> dob1: Well as long as you're not mounting any volumes you should be fine. However if you do that might be an issue since on your host system there's another user attached to this. Also depends on *where* you want to run it i suppose. E.g. in a typical k8s environment you'd have a dedicated NFS storage backend etc. where mounted volumes live and that one doesn't care about file UIDs/GIDs
[17:17:11] <kek_> tabakhase, yeah, no idea what the other 3 at the bottom are. I probably played around with them at some point. I can just remove all that.
[17:17:20] <tabakhase> and for giggles, swap that -t and the build arg around... wonder if just the parser is getting fuzzled...
[17:17:43] <kek_> tabakhase, Docker version 20.10.13, build a224086349
[17:18:38] <tabakhase> kek_ i dont mean as in those make problems - but as in when your docker-daemon has been existent on that host for "a while" - is that some 18.x or actually modern docker? -- 20.10 answers this indeed as all fresh
[17:19:11] <dob1> Anticom, can you explain me this better "However if you do that might be an issue since on your host system there's another user attached to this." ?
[17:20:11] <dob1> because it can access to it ?
[17:21:10] <kek_> can I somehow remove a docker image using its ID?
[17:21:54] <tabakhase> sure, generally interchangeable
[17:22:00] <Anticom> dob1: As far as I know when you mount volumes from inside the docker container to your host system (using --mount or --volume flags) and you write to that mounted volume from inside the container it has the UID and GID from the user running inside the container. However if your host system has a user (systemd-resolve in your case) that imposes some potential security issues since your host system reads the same U
[17:22:00] <Anticom> ID & GID
[17:22:36] <Anticom> kek_: docker rmi <name> where <name> can also be the ID (especially useful if untagged)
[17:23:24] <Anticom> kek_: however you can also do `docker image prune` to remove all images that aren't used by any container at the time of running it afaik. However I don't use it very often because I'm always afraid it's gonna delete some image that I actually still need :D
[17:24:10] <kek_> Anticom, can I somehow just eradicate everything?
[17:26:24] <Anticom> kek_: There's little hack to do this: `docker images -q` gives you all docker image IDs without printing any headers or any other information. Since `docker rmi` will accept multiple image IDs you can compose the two commands to `docker rmi $(docker images -q)` do wipe all images on your system. However be aware that it won't remove any images wich containers attached (`docker ps -a`)
[17:26:27] <tabakhase> you mean like "format C:\" on docker? stop docker, clean out /var/lib/docker - this "should" spring back to recreated the minimals on start...
[17:26:45] <Anticom> tabakhase: I wouldn't mess with any files directly
[17:27:35] <tabakhase> hence it rly just beeing the "format C:\" equ.^^
[17:27:41] <Anticom> Also just to be clear about it: I use the backticks just as a delimiter here in chat, you're not supposed to copy them when running the commands ;)
[17:28:14] <Anticom> That would lead to undesirable results since `` is basically the outdated version of $()
[17:28:19] <kek_> Anticom, that doesn't remove images though, it seems that only removes containers, no? I basically just want to remove everything that somehow is "docker". :D 
[17:28:39] <Anticom> kek_: did you use rmi?
[17:28:52] <tabakhase> for "everything" its images, containers, networks, volumes....
[17:29:02] <tabakhase> technically contexts, and builders too these days i guess :P
[17:29:12] <Anticom> kek_: there's a difference between `docker rm` and `docker rmi`
[17:30:29] <kek_> Anticom, there is? I thought I've read it being an alias. tabakhase yeah I just want to annihilate the whole thing but I guess that'll need a bit more digging then, thanks.
[17:30:51] <Anticom> kek_: `docker rm` removes containers whereas `docker rmi` removes images
[17:31:26] <Anticom> kek_: the i in rmi is the mnemonic for "remove image"
[17:32:41] <kek_> yeah I misread what you said. yeah I got rid of all images and containers. I'll have to read more about docker tosee if there's anything else.
[17:32:42] <Anticom> well the mnemonic for rmi alltogether is "remove image" to be precise :D

[18:10:49] <kek_> tabakhase, https://bpa.st/L76Q note the "cannot normalize nothing" also note that I run "sudo docker build --build-arg ncpus=2 -t "numcse_monolith" ." also note, I don't have WORKDIR env. var. Also, why is an image created if something goes wrong? 
[18:16:06] <tabakhase> that looks funky indeed, whack an extra RUN echo this; behind the workdir,  but yea pretty sure thats a failed build.
[18:16:17] <tabakhase> on why you get an image anyhow - well you kinda dont
[18:16:34] <tabakhase> and garbage collection is a separate thing
[18:17:28] <kek_> tabakhase, I mean it takes up space on my disk. I, probably naively, expect it to just remove everything if it failed.
[18:19:03] <kek_> tabakhase, what should I echo where? 
[18:19:10] <tabakhase> that said, those USER&WORKDIR at the end of the dockerfile dont make much sense... if those are runtime things, "docker run -w bla --user blub ..." takes that job...

[18:27:19] <kek_> ah omg nevermind, I'm an idiot.

[18:27:38] <tabakhase> ;-)
[18:28:54] <tabakhase> also note how "the step before that2 had spitout the "d984ac..." id - what is that very ID that shows up in your image-list
[18:29:06] <kek_> I removed some useless comments at the beginning so I had a different number of lines :p anyway, I rerun it. thanks.
[18:31:25] <tabakhase> so well, set a fixed workdir, then ya image should complete at least, and who wants to change that, uses the direct workdir switch docker offers, not env-vars --- for the "user thing" the full truth is a bit more complicated... if "annon users" are fine, dockers --user will do just fine, for more elaborate things (chmods, needing a valid $HOME and such) have a read here: https://github.com/b

[18:31:56] <kek_> tabakhase, what does " ---> " indicate?
[18:32:43] <kek_> tabakhase, I mean, the workdir is set though isnt it?
[18:32:52] <tabakhase> "doing this at buildtime" can kinda work - but onyl "for images locally to you" if that makes sense -- as you wont knwo my user/ids and your devsystem will need different ones to my dev system needs different ones to test to prod and so on ;-) -- but in that case, youd pair those with corresponding build-args again :P
[18:34:38] <tabakhase> the "----> " is just "id of the result from above" in that case

[18:37:42] <tabakhase> so the build fails before as said
[18:38:01] <tabakhase> not sure whats the issue here still...

[18:39:54] <kek_> tabakhase, I should have everything I need to fix it? I didn't change anything other than adding those echos. Should I have changed something?
[18:40:46] <kek_> I don't find any verbose flags. Isn't there a way to get more info? 
[18:40:49] <tabakhase> those echos are purely to understand that things fail before that
[18:41:16] <tabakhase> you dont ened anym  more info, that whole "WORKDIR ${WORKDIR}" line is just complete nonsense
[18:41:20] <tabakhase> throw it out, gucci
[18:41:35] <tabakhase> need anymore - jesus my typing... getting late...
[18:42:28] <kek_> tabakhase, just the WORKDIR? what about the USER? is there a difference between WORKDIR and workdir? (I tried finding docs for WORKDIR but couldn't)
[18:43:25] <tabakhase> both dont make any sense there in that way ;-) - but the USER one at least seems to get bypassed / be a noop, maybe container is also utterly broken in the end, only one way to find out YEP
[18:45:19] <tabakhase> and not sure how you "dont find docs" its literally the 1# result searching "docker workdir", even on bing-search https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#workdir

[18:47:58] <kek_> ah I think I tried to find if there's a diff between workdir and WORKDIR. Anyway, I guess the issue is then that the last line evaluate to "WORKDIR " and docker doesn't like that. We'll see. 
[18:49:15] <kek_> as I said, I don't have such an env. var (assuming Dockerfile evaluates my local env vars).

[18:59:24] <tabakhase> that error is just that there is no such variable $WORKDIR - so "WORKDIR=null" seems to break its shit then :P -- whats super odd in a lot of ways, as `-w ""` for example works just fine (and defaults to / then)
[18:59:50] <tabakhase> or, if docker sets that var himself - setitng the var to the same value and tryint to build a layer from this may go hammy too :P

[19:01:25] <tabakhase> usually a failed build should also still print some docker-cli line that it failed or so, so that whole "one internal debug message and thing is just gone" part after the no-nothing is certainly a bit spook :D
[19:01:48] *** Joins: AnapodoPsalidi (~AnapodoPs@195.46.31.29)
[19:04:00] <kek_> I tried to reproduce it but if I take e.g. the getting started Dockerfile and att WORKDIR at the end, it just tells me that it needs an argument. So no idea, way too much of a docker noob to make sense of any of it.

[19:07:31] <kek_> tabakhase, it looks like Docker just checks if there is an argument provided and not if the arugment evalautes to anything. E.g. "WORKDIR " => nice error but "WORKDIR ${this_env_var_doesnt_exist}" = cannot normalize nothing.
