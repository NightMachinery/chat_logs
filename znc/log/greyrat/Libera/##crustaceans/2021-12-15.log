[00:00:27] <pja> Unlikely. Although the one exception was last seen trying to set up a cryptocurrency hedgehund, so he probably makes up for all the rest.
[00:00:54] <imode> someone's going to have enough, eventually, and go on a killing spree at one of those crypto hedge funds.
[00:01:00] <pja> (He had also fallen head first into the SV rationalist / ethical thinking cults, so there‚Äôs that too.)
[00:01:08] <imode> I won't feel sorry for anyone affected.
[00:01:37] <imode> my empathy stops where your grift begins.

[00:28:18] <manicennui> Just learned that we have placed orders for hardware that won't arrive until June.
[00:28:40] <manicennui> And our SAN solution is at like 92% utilization.
[00:29:22] <imode> oof.
[00:29:26] <imode> oh!
[00:29:33] <imode> manicennui: https://www.vintagestory.at/
[00:29:33] <buttsbot> Home - Vintage Story
[00:29:36] <imode> found a game for you.
[00:29:52] <manicennui> Hmm. Looks interesting.
[00:29:53] <defect> the people who source hw for us expect the shortage to last throughout 2022
[00:30:40] *** Joins: alpernebbi (~quassel@user/alpernebbi)
[00:32:37] <manicennui> Watched the video. Definitely interesting.
[00:32:54] <manicennui> I actually really enjoyed Minecraft, but haven't played it for a very long time. I haven't ever played survival mode.
[00:33:07] <manicennui> This looks a *lot* like Minecraft, but they seem to claim that it has its own engine.
[00:33:47] <imode> it does. it's in C#.
[00:33:52] <imode> I can run it on my shit thinkpad.
[00:34:00] <imode> and it's incredibly deep. captivated me for 4 hours.
[00:34:17] <manicennui> On a related note, how is C# any better than Java for games?
[00:34:34] <manicennui> And does Unity use the CLR to run C#?
[00:34:39] <Geekingfrog> because you can use unity with it ?
[00:34:42] <imode> and by that time, I was collecting firewood, harvesting berries and meat from spent carcasses eaten by wolves, firing crucibles for smelting ore in a pit kiln, making charcoal by stacking a bunch of wood in a hole, lighting it on fire and covering it..
[00:35:02] <manicennui> Geekingfrog: Why would that make a difference performance wise?
[00:35:11] <imode> the clay mechanic is interesting, each thing you make is built up by little voxels, and each lump of clay is worth like 32 voxels.
[00:35:18] <imode> and you have to manually place them in the mold.
[00:35:59] <manicennui> I like voxel graphics, especially when they are smaller than Minecraft's voxels.
[00:36:18] <imode> there's also a slew of mods for it.
[00:36:23] <imode> with a native modding API.
[00:36:24] <manicennui> Some incredible stuff made with MagicaVoxel. Not sure how much of it could reasonably be used in a game.
[00:36:35] <Geekingfrog> manicennui, no idea. I'd say from a distance that the 2 languages are pretty similar, not sure of the specifics when it comes to game.
[00:37:15] <manicennui> imode: I'll check it out at some point.
[00:37:25] <imode> I'll probably host a server at some point.
[00:37:33] <imode> multiplayer is a game changer.
[00:38:38] <river> cool
[00:38:44] <manicennui> I backed the kickstarter for this game: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1638500/The_Garden_Path/
[00:38:44] <buttsbot> The Garden Path on Steam
[00:38:52] <manicennui> It is kind of like Animal Crossing.
[00:38:53] <imode> to make picks, axes, knives, etc. you actually have to knap the fucking flint and stone you pick up off the ground.
[00:39:06] <imode> like, carve out a knife.
[00:39:14] <imode> also, wow, godot.
[00:39:38] <imode> it looks like an oil painting, I dig it.
[00:40:41] <epilys> I kinda want to make a game like Animal Crossing with PSX graphics
[00:40:49] <epilys> but with an urban angle as well
[00:41:09] <manicennui> What would PSX graphics look like?
[00:41:10] <imode> the urban angle would be really neat. city living.
[00:41:23] <manicennui> Would you have gangs?
[00:41:38] <epilys> manicennui, low poly but not excessively
[00:41:40] <epilys> https://adamgryu.itch.io/a-short-hike
[00:41:41] <buttsbot> A Short Hike by adamgryu
[00:41:42] <epilys> Kinda like this game
[00:41:52] <epilys> it has great graphics/design
[00:42:07] <epilys> but is limited in a small island (literally a short hike)
[00:42:11] <manicennui> I like Short Hike too. On my list to play.
[00:42:42] <imode> short hike was lovely.
[00:42:53] <imode> too short imo, though, for the price.
[00:43:02] <imode> heartwarming despite that.
[00:43:18] <manicennui> I imagine you could create some super addictive MMO with this kind of aesthetic/casual play and make a killing.
[00:43:37] <epilys> imode, you pay for quality i guess
[00:43:48] <manicennui> Short Hike has been part of several bundles.
[00:43:53] <epilys> manicennui, let's make a startup?
[00:44:08] <epilys> maybe we can do a blockchain scam (here we go again)
[00:44:22] <manicennui> See, I want to do it without any true scams.
[00:44:33] <imode> I'm down to do MMO gamedev.
[00:44:35] <manicennui> Although I have some reservations about getting people addicted to a game.
[00:45:28] <epilys> Nintendo charges 60~ euros for animal crossing and it has no paid addons or pay to win
[00:45:33] <epilys> it's a reasonable approach
[00:45:58] <epilys> then again the studio already had a dev pipeline ready
[00:46:02] <manicennui> Yeah, and limited multiplayer.
[00:46:11] <bkero> I agree that no paid addons or pay to win is great
[00:46:23] <bkero> But I am not so sure ACNH has enough content to be worth 60 EUR.
[00:46:34] <epilys> My sister got it and I think it does
[00:46:38] <manicennui> I don't know how sustainable a single upfront price is for most games though.
[00:46:45] <manicennui> Unless the game is just done after issues are fixed.
[00:46:51] <imode> ACNH isn't worth th emoney.
[00:46:53] <imode> *the money.
[00:46:54] <bkero> also what do you mean no paid addons? https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/2021/animal-crossing-new-horizons-happy-home-paradise-dlc-available-now/
[00:46:54] <buttsbot> Animal Crossing New Horizons Happy Home Paradise DLC available now - Nintendo - Official Site
[00:47:09] <imode> yeah that DLC isn't worth it either.
[00:47:14] <epilys> Hm didn't know about that DLC.
[00:47:18] <imode> it should've been part of the base game. animal crossing is really barren.
[00:47:27] <epilys> Have you played it?
[00:47:31] <imode> it's just sold on "LOOK AT ALL THE CUTE ANIMALS DON'T YOU WANNA COLLECT THEM ALL?!"
[00:47:36] <manicennui> I think you either need to do paid add-ons, microtransactions (yuck), or a subscription to make things sustainable.
[00:47:39] <imode> yeah. since the DS ver.
[00:47:52] <epilys> Subscription is the most rational approach imo
[00:47:53] <manicennui> Or the game has to be done after fixing bugs.
[00:47:56] <imode> had the DS version, the wii one, the 3DS one, the gamecube one, the N64 one.
[00:48:01] <imode> there's little subtance there.
[00:48:07] <epilys> it's fun though
[00:48:14] <bkero> Most games are done after fixing bugs.
[00:48:16] <imode> for maybe a month.
[00:48:21] <epilys> then again you can't argue about taste; these things are subjective
[00:48:42] <imode> like, give me things to _do_.
[00:48:47] <epilys> I'm having trouble thinking of "minigame" activities to do in an urban setting
[00:48:58] <imode> there's nothing to do in animal crossing once you've built the ideal place.
[00:49:02] <imode> and paid off everything.
[00:49:10] <imode> you'll read the same villager dialogue over and over.
[00:49:10] <manicennui> epilys: GTA V
[00:49:18] <epilys> I was thinking of adding an occupation/job logic creation with building blocks of logic
[00:49:27] <epilys> so that you can create your own jobs/stores/etc
[00:49:29] <imode> that'd be nice.
[00:49:39] <epilys> and interact with the town's market
[00:49:46] <manicennui> To some extent I don't want to do grindy activities that mirror real life.
[00:49:50] <manicennui> Like I already have a job.
[00:49:58] <manicennui> And growing vegetables is far more enjoyable in real life.
[00:50:04] <epilys> it's not for everyone manicennui
[00:50:08] <epilys> I get that
[00:50:10] <manicennui> Sure.
[00:50:20] <manicennui> I'm not sure that most people really enjoy that stuff.
[00:50:29] <manicennui> I think a lot of things in video games are addictive, not fun.
[00:50:37] <manicennui> But we have a hard time telling the difference.
[00:50:43] <manicennui> And fun is hard.
[00:51:10] <epilys> This morning I played my sister's ACNH for about 30 minutes, it was fun certainly
[00:51:42] <epilys> (btw ACNH is the first Animal Crossing game I haven't bought for myself so I was already a fan)
[00:51:43] <manicennui> Like I don't enjoy the fishing in ACNH, but I think our brains certainly enjoy the reward of catching a fish.
[00:51:54] <manicennui> Yeah, I had never played previous versions either.
[00:51:56] <epilys> it needs tweaks yeah
[00:52:16] <epilys> I thought Wild World was the epitome of the series
[00:55:25] <manicennui> I think fishing is a good example of something that is almost universally grindy and maybe addictive, but never fun in video games.
[00:55:41] <manicennui> Imagine if fishing were more like an RPG or card game battle.
[00:55:55] <manicennui> But instead of defeating the fish, you catch it.
[00:56:22] <manicennui> Basically a loot drop.
[00:56:23] <epilys> you slap it around with a large trout
[00:56:40] <manicennui> Battle mechanics are usually much more fun.
[00:56:46] <manicennui> And you could do it without violence.

[01:02:18] <manicennui> Just don't feel great.
[01:02:23] <manicennui> And I can tell I'll regret finishing it.
[01:02:43] <epilys> if that's a recent thing and you also have increased thirst you should have your blood sugar checked
[01:04:05] <manicennui> I don't have diabetes.
[01:04:08] <manicennui> I get tested every year.
[01:04:15] <manicennui> It's right around the limit.

[01:25:24] <dimadima> weird how companies can just push something like "metaverse" into existence
[01:25:27] <dimadima> ~crazy
[01:28:55] <dimadima> an underappreciated thing about "modern" JS/TS is how it lets you mix in other languages/syntaxes all over the place
[01:29:12] <dimadima> JSX, CSS-in-JS with styled-components/emotion, graphql
[01:29:20] <dimadima> it's pretty cool
[01:29:36] <dimadima> i'm sure lisp people are not impressed
[01:30:02] <dimadima> but with TS it's all typed
[01:35:38] <dimadima> a pretty typical module https://gist.github.com/dminkovsky/41529548d9e7eca76e35671e5f80fed8

[01:39:24] <dimadima> the code formatting, for those who appreciate code formatting, on gist doesn't do it justice
[01:41:56] <epilys> Wow that syntax _is_ weird
[01:41:59] <epilys> const {query} = router;
[01:42:01] <epilys> what?
[01:42:51] <manicennui> Someone at Applebee's asked, "How can we make our food even worse?"
[01:46:26] <dimadima> that's just the same as `const query = router.query;`
[01:46:37] <dimadima> it's a destructure
[01:46:52] <dimadima> saves you a `query`
[01:47:16] <dimadima> and allows you to extract several properties as locally scoped variables at once
[01:48:29] <epilys> oof
[01:49:08] <epilys> makes sense now but it doesn't seem intuitive
[01:50:17] <dimadima> i enjoy the syntax
[01:50:29] <dimadima> and how it all works
[01:50:55] <dimadima> it would be cool if certain things were simpler, like the dom and if there was only one event model instead of, like, 3
[01:51:06] <dimadima> UI events, that is (mouse events, touch events, pointer events)

[04:39:48] <imode> what's the density of football artificial turf.
[04:40:49] <imode> or better yet, just average density of US topsoil.
[04:41:36] <imode> apparently the density of "dirt" is 1510kg/m^3.
[04:43:25] <imode> okay that'd mean that I have 2,462,462.7kg of microbes inside of me.
[04:43:36] <imode> I only weigh 231lb man.
[04:44:24] <wrl> how tall are you?
[04:44:47] <imode> 5'11".
[04:45:57] <imode> it doesn't help if you make the depth of the field 1" either.
[04:46:30] <imode> that's still 205,205kg
[04:47:06] <imode> where the hell did you see that, mostlymicrobes.
[04:48:00] <imode> if you made the field 1mm thick, that'd still be 8kg
[04:49:52] <imode> sorry, that'd be 8,000kg.
[04:50:02] <imode> if you made the field a micron thick, it'd be 8 kilograms.

[15:07:28] <epilys> nice, printed camvas? looks good
[15:07:40] <epilys> 11 celsius here
[15:07:46] <Brekkjern> Printed, yeah
[15:09:16] <Brekkjern> I was concerned the quality would be mid, but it is actually pretty good
[15:11:12] <gwozniak> Brekkjern: it's another very mild feeling not-quite-officially-winter-yet here
[15:11:42] <gwozniak> It hit more than 15C a few days ago (but didn't last)
[15:12:16] <gwozniak> Supposed to be a high of more than 10C here today and tomorrow
[15:12:51] <gwozniak> The weather announcers that I hear always say, "It's going to be a lovely day!" for this kind of thing
[15:13:04] <gwozniak> They should really be saying, "This is freaky"
[15:13:24] <Brekkjern> Mhm
[15:13:52] <Brekkjern> It's not uncommon for it to be mild in December, but it's usually around 1-2C when it is

[15:29:26] <Brekkjern> Bleh. I tried the gitea idea you suggested epilys. It kinda works, but not quite :S
[15:30:12] <epilys> what went wrong?

[15:30:38] <Brekkjern> So it's not rendering out that part...
[15:30:58] <epilys> you gotta wait till then :p
[15:31:01] <Brekkjern> Hah
[15:31:04] <Brekkjern> I got until tomorrow :P
[15:32:17] <epilys> fix the timestamp with a rebase?

[17:25:26] <epilys> river, python scripting?
[17:25:30] <cb_> snek
[17:25:40] <river> > So why do a lot of the best software engineers not use a debugger?
[17:25:47] <river> sneaky assumption
[17:25:54] <river> I'm pretty sure the best engineers do use a debugger
[17:25:58] <epilys> üêç üóÉ üí¨
[17:26:05] <river> its hard to read this kind of crap
[17:26:10] <demiurge> i dunno, it varies a lot
[17:26:22] <demiurge> i've known some brilliant engineers who don't really
[17:26:56] <epilys> you don't just use a debugger whenever, it's like pushing stuff only with a hammer
[17:27:07] <epilys> if I want to see if a callback fires printf debugging is enough
[17:27:08] <gwozniak> river: You can set breakpoints for files in gdb. See the "rbreak" command
[17:27:18] <gwozniak> Same for regex matching of function names
[17:27:31] <gwozniak> Which I use all the time for finding out when GCC steps into backend code
[17:27:49] <river> oh my gosh
[17:27:51] <demiurge> mostly i guess i use gdb to poke at coredumps
[17:27:53] <river> thank you gwozniak !!!!
[17:28:33] <gwozniak> I do something that seems to escape the analysis of these "great devs": I use thinking *and* a debugger
[17:28:33] <buttsbot> üëè developers üëè developers üëè developers üëè
[17:28:44] <gwozniak> It's quite a leap, I know
[17:28:48] <river> the printf post was cringe honestly
[17:28:51] <demiurge> i mean everyone uses thinking
[17:29:05] <epilys> gwozniak, novel approach
[17:29:55] <river> i didn't even bother to read it based on the tilte
[17:30:10] <river> and when I tried to read, it was only a couple paragraphs in before i lost interest in whatever point they were trying to make
[17:30:12] <cb_> gwozniak: i commented as such
[17:30:19] <river> i dont know what they did wrong with their writing style
[17:30:23] <demiurge> i do think you'd probably find that people who don't regularly use a debugger are better at debugging things in situations where debuggers are not available
[17:30:39] <river> it feels kind of like the thing they're arguing for is so obviously wrong
[17:30:49] <demiurge> i dunno, it doesn't seem obvious to me
[17:31:38] <demiurge> it may well be wrong, but it's not clear how to prove it wrong using things i know are true
[17:31:47] <river> demiurge: its like epilys said
[17:31:52] <river> printf is a tool, gdb is a tool
[17:31:55] <demiurge> yes
[17:32:01] <river> they do different things
[17:32:03] <demiurge> yes
[17:32:28] <river> sometimes its easier to use printfs, sometimes its easier to use gdb, usually I have a mix of both
[17:32:47] <demiurge> but i don't think that really dents the hypothesis that using one particular tool lets you avoid developing some important skill
[17:33:08] <demiurge> i have first-hand experiennce of this; i failed at least one math course at university because of maple
[17:33:49] <river> what happened with maple? were you using it to do integrals for you?
[17:33:58] <demiurge> literally yes
[17:34:39] <river> that's a tricky one. I personally believe that tools like maple can be a huge help in learning things like how to do integrals
[17:35:05] <demiurge> i mean, they probably could have been
[17:35:33] <river> to be honest, if you can correctly input things and correctly read them out of a computer - that's already a
[17:35:35] <river>  success at a significant chunk of understanding the material
[17:35:46] <demiurge> but i was a dumb student and only focused on solving the question in front of me and didn't pay attention to the fact that the course was trying to teach me things
[17:36:29] <river> does not sound dumb, being able to solve problems is a skill
[17:36:48] <demiurge> yes, but having foresight is also a skill
[17:37:03] <river> I find that some of the way math is taught is very frustrating - being able to solve something using anything and everything you have available is valid in the real world
[17:37:05] <demiurge> and if i'd practised that one i would have realised i needed to be able to solve the problems without a computer
[17:37:24] <river> sometimes people come with math questions like "How do I do X but I cannot use L'Hopital"
[17:37:30] <demiurge> yes that is annoying
[17:37:33] <river> and it's just like.. you have to do much ugly working out
[17:37:35] <gwozniak> cb_: a little salt in the morning joe: https://lobste.rs/s/bkuwht/printf_debugging_srinivasa_ramanujan#c_xjmtdp
[17:37:35] <buttsbot> Printf Debugging and Srinivasa Ramanujan | Lobsters
[17:37:47] <demiurge> i think that's sort of relevant here in that engineers are usually required to solve a particular problem and are not given time to develop their skills
[17:38:17] <river> yeah
[17:39:28] <demiurge> an engineer equipped with a debugger is going to be strictly better at debugging than the same engineer with no debugger. but practising the same kind of work without the debugger might force them to learn new techniques
[17:40:28] <river> I don't think so, you're not going to forget how to print stuff out
[17:43:39] <gwozniak> I think it's a worthwhile exercise to fix a bug without a debugger that you otherwise would fix with one
[17:43:53] <gwozniak> But it does not follow that it is better in the long run
[17:44:31] <gwozniak> And yeah, sometimes you can't use a debugger. And even sometimes, it's easier without one
[17:45:29] <demiurge> i think the extent to which it's better or worse is probably very dependent on circumstance
[17:45:55] <gwozniak> Yes, it's highly variable
[17:47:10] <demiurge> i can believe the skills you pick up debugging without a debugger translate into other programming tasks (easy example: knowing which things deserve to get logged)
[17:47:39] <demiurge> i agree that "a lot of the best software engineers not use a debugger" seems unfounded
[17:47:40] <river> that's a fair point, knowing what stuff to log is a good thing to think about
[17:47:49] <demiurge> and even if it were true it could be because the best software engineers never write bugs
[17:48:12] <dcz_> this reminds me of how a debugger can influence the design of a system: https://cliffle.com/blog/on-hubris-and-humility/
[17:48:13] <buttsbot> - On Hubris And Humility - Cliffle -
[17:48:31] <gwozniak> If all you're using a debugger for is to make the tests pass, then you're just being a lame dev
[17:48:44] <gwozniak> Or your job is very narrow
[17:48:58] <cb_> gwozniak: replied with a dig at unix people
[17:49:45] <river> ‚Äúreal programmers don‚Äôt use debuggers‚Äù <-- nailed it
[17:49:48] <demiurge> to some extent it's about prioritization, right? one needs to know when it's appropriate to treat a problem as a learning experience and when one should just pull out all the stops to get something done
[17:49:54] <river> I never caught that, that was the point of the post and why it put me off
[17:49:59] <river> it's just a real men thing
[17:50:42] <cb_> mel is the most real programmer
[17:50:44] <gwozniak> demiurge: yeah, the real skill is knowing what tool to apply, when, and why
[17:51:13] <gwozniak> That usually takes exposure to various approaches and/or contexts
[17:51:53] <river> i forgot how mel debugged
[17:53:23] <cb_> mel didnt need to debug because they got it right the first time
[17:53:25] <demiurge> (ftr i think it's quite correct that things die when they have problems)
[17:54:17] <gwozniak> dcz_: yeah, that's something I need to read. thx
[17:54:42] <dcz_> yw
[17:55:34] <demiurge> it's frustrating how close to being good paperwm is
[17:55:43] <demiurge> maybe i should try to make some changes to it
[17:56:50] <river> go for it!
[17:56:53] <river> what is it lacking?
[17:57:06] <demiurge> it takes too many moves to do various things
[17:57:24] <river> it does look promising
[17:59:10] <demiurge> it rearranges the workspaces in a stack-like fashion and you can't turn that off; i'd much rather keep them in a defined order. the touchpad gesture to switch between them doesn't switch by itself; you have to scroll and then click. options manage columns without the mouse are too limited. and so is managing with the mouse; it's quite easy to accidentally untile a window
[17:59:21] <demiurge> s/options/& to/
[17:59:42] <river> I prefer a defined order too
[18:00:30] <dcz_> defined order all the way. Also, neat idea. I wanted to implement something similar at some point myself
[18:00:45] <demiurge> there's no way to turn off the feature that focusing a window scrolls your view to it, which i can see is quite sensible, but doesn't really do it for me
[18:00:47] <dcz_> we need a different paradigm for switching windows
[18:01:42] <demiurge> i'm interested in trying newm at some point
[18:01:56] <cb_> demiurge: i found paperwm interesting but havent kept up with it
[18:02:07] <cb_> mostly bc i found stock gnome good enough. how they doin on keeping up with gnome changes
[18:02:19] <demiurge> it seems ok so far
[18:02:22] <demiurge> mostly pretty polished
[18:02:39] <demiurge> i was surviving with stock gnome but it didn't feel very good
[18:03:21] <epilys> demiurge, be onomatopoeic; create!

[19:39:12] <manicennui> It is a matter of many companies having no one who knows how to do it.
[19:39:21] <manicennui> But "self-host" is kind of vague.
[19:39:31] <manicennui> Many companies would be fine with linode or whatever.
[19:39:32] <companion_cube> we all just wait for oxide, ofc
[19:42:14] <manicennui> Many companies would probably be fine with dreamhost shared hosting.
[19:42:23] <manicennui> Despite their delusions of grandeur.
[19:42:49] <bontaq> webscale ;)
[19:44:39] <companion_cube> is linode more reliable than AWS though?
[19:45:06] <manicennui> Probably similar.
[19:45:25] <companion_cube> afaiu these outages are on the crummy us-east-1 region, too
[19:45:44] <manicennui> Unless you actually design an architecture that takes advantage of AWS's multiple regions, which few seem to do.
[19:45:51] <manicennui> companion_cube: The current one is west I believe.
[19:47:06] <companion_cube> ahah damn
[19:49:08] <manicennui> Think linode has multiple data centers too.
[19:51:02] <demiurge> i think it is already cheaper to self-host than to use AWS
[19:51:10] <demiurge> it's just less convenient
[19:54:43] <manicennui> I find AWS inconvenient.
[19:54:56] <manicennui> But I did sys admin work for many years, so none of it bothers me.
[19:55:21] <manicennui> Including building out a cage in a data center.
[19:55:24] <demiurge> so do i, but we're not companies
[19:55:44] <manicennui> My employer has two cages in different data centers, plus we use AWS.
[19:55:54] <manicennui> We were told yesterday that the CEO is a bit concerned about our AWS bill.
[19:55:58] <demiurge> if you were a company you'd have to worry about paying people to manage your non-AWS infrastructure
[19:56:15] <manicennui> I would hire the BOFH.
[19:56:35] <manicennui> Gilfoyle basically is the BOFH.
[19:57:16] <demiurge> and it's not just ops people; to get the most out of your own infrastructure you need to design your software around it to some extent
[19:57:32] <manicennui> I tend to also be friends with developers who have a sys admin background, or could do it if they had to.
[19:57:44] <manicennui> It's kind of annoying to me how little most developers know about that stuff.
[19:57:47] <demiurge> AWS is a way of throwing overprovisioning at the problem in a way that's financially acceptable
[19:57:51] <demiurge> yeah
[19:58:05] <manicennui> Not that they should manage our infrastructure, but they are totally lost when anything goes wrong in their development environment.
[19:58:09] <manicennui> And useless for prod support.
[19:59:36] <manicennui> Someone on my team (who is no longer with the company) wrote a makefile with a bunch of commands that everyone else on the team uses. Most of them have no idea how it works, and when something doesn't work, they are just stuck and ask the other clueless people on slack what to do.
[19:59:59] <manicennui> I don't use it, but sometimes I'm nice enough to read it for them and tell them what to do.
[20:02:39] <manicennui> "It SSHes into your VM and executes this command, which is no longer valid. You must use this other command/flag/whatever now."
[20:08:56] <manicennui> Someone started a thread on slack where they shared the original "new hire" email about our CEO from 8 years ago. Several jokes in the thread. He finally responded today with, "I have to be the only 8 year employee who has NEVER been promoted. ü§£"

[20:32:53] <manicennui> Why doesn't anyone have a Chief Cloud Officer?
[20:35:31] <mostlymicrobes> solid question
[20:36:09] <companion_cube> why have a CCO when you can have a "Cloud Distributed Decision Commitee"
[20:36:16] <gwozniak> Very nebulous position
[20:36:18] <companion_cube> that way the decision making is more scalable
[20:36:23] <manicennui> Hmm. You make a good point.
[20:36:37] <manicennui> And gwozniak makes a good pun.
[20:36:37] <mostlymicrobes> manicennui's company only recently became Web Scalee
[20:36:50] <companion_cube> gwozniak's cloud pun rains on my parade
[20:36:50] <manicennui> mostlymicrobes: Yeah, we were busy making money instead.
[20:37:21] <mostlymicrobes> mongo though
[20:37:47] <manicennui> We don't actually have scaling problems generally, but some of the geeks like to introduce them by writing new services to replace existing functionality that can't handle the load.
[20:38:19] <mostlymicrobes> 16 TBs though
[20:38:37] <manicennui> Yeah, we are scaling our storage usage up!
[20:38:53] <mostlymicrobes> you are what you store
[20:38:58] <manicennui> That problem will be resolved. Using AWS is not the solution.

[20:39:25] <ngoldbaum> is glitch dead yet?
[20:39:43] <manicennui> WTF is web3?
[20:39:48] <river> > web3 is already too big to fail
[20:39:52] <river> wait what
[20:39:55] <river> i thought thi was a joke term
[20:39:57] <mostlymicrobes> you've missed web3?
[20:40:03] <manicennui> Apparently.
[20:40:05] <mostlymicrobes> no people are very serious about web3
[20:40:09] <mostlymicrobes> damn manicennui
[20:40:10] <river> also ive decided that im going to stop using a web browser and just go on gopher
[20:40:13] <mostlymicrobes> that's impressive
[20:40:22] <manicennui> river: Not gemini?
[20:40:26] <mostlymicrobes> is CNN on gopher
[20:40:35] <mostlymicrobes> is Disney on gopher?

[20:40:51] <ngoldbaum> is ruby on rails?
[20:40:56] <manicennui> Okay, I will purposely miss web3.
[20:40:57] <companion_cube> manicennui: really, you don't have a Chief Web3 Officer?
[20:40:59] <companion_cube> peons.
[20:41:03] <river> what the hell is glitch? a linktree homepage?
[20:41:21] <river> manicennui: nah i dont like it, it's spitting up the community
[20:41:22] <ngoldbaum> manicennui: what you don‚Äôt want to pay etherium gas fees to edit your reddit posts?
[20:41:48] <manicennui> river: The gopher community?
[20:41:57] <river> well
[20:41:59] <river> not exactly
[20:42:04] <ngoldbaum> river: https://glitch.com
[20:42:13] <river> it's more like any newcomes who get curious about gopher suddenly get jumped on by gemini people
[20:42:23] <river> newcomers*
[20:42:28] <ngoldbaum> anil dash‚Äôs old company, they fired a bunch of people and it‚Äôs in a holding pattern now
[20:42:44] <cb_> web3 is a forced meme
[20:42:44] <ngoldbaum> glitch is cool but i don‚Äôt see how it ever made sense to be a VC-backed startup
[20:43:13] <river> but i think this sucks, we had a really cozy gopher community and it was a nice thing but now there's this 'fight' because gemini people want to win and get ahold everyone
[20:43:22] <ngoldbaum> the trouble with all these ponzi-backed tech schemes is they ruin word of mouth
[20:43:29] <manicennui> river: All 10 of you?
[20:43:32] <river> lol
[20:43:33] <manicennui> Sorry.
[20:43:34] <ngoldbaum> because early adopters get outsized benefit from the ponzi
[20:43:37] <cb_> river: the gemini people are RFC LARPers or devault wantging to bully you
[20:43:41] <cb_> from my impression anyways
[20:43:46] <river> that as well cb
[20:43:53] <cb_> i.e. hsi tantrum over favicons
[20:44:00] <manicennui> Is there seriously a gopher community at this point?
[20:44:06] <river> yes there is manicennui
[20:44:08] <manicennui> And is it more than a handful of sites?

[20:46:31] <river> i was actually thinking of implementing a new gopherd
[20:46:48] <river> just because i've been getting interested in systemd and I found out the rules for making a daemon

[20:47:20] <gwozniak> As in, the "it's relatively easy if..." statement

[20:49:33] <gwozniak> It's the "everything would be great if all software was great" argument, and it's pointless
[20:49:55] <manicennui> Obviously all software should also be lisp.
[20:50:02] <manicennui> Which by definition is great.
[20:50:04] <ngoldbaum> one would simply write an AI that can learn and wrap novel APIs via introspection and learning from the docs
[20:50:18] <gwozniak> clearly this is the way
[20:50:22] <ngoldbaum> but in the process accidentally spawn skynet
[20:50:45] <manicennui> I want to figure out how to get back the feeling I had during the early Internet.
[20:50:58] <manicennui> I ran a FreeBSD server at home that was connected via dial-up.
[20:51:06] <manicennui> And eventually ADSL.
[20:51:10] <manicennui> Ran all my own services.
[20:51:24] <companion_cube> I started with AOL as a teenager
[20:51:27] <companion_cube> can't say I missed it
[20:51:34] <manicennui> There were cool things on the Internet other than cat videos.
[20:51:51] <manicennui> I started with AOL for a short period of time.
[20:52:02] <manicennui> Then I learned that one could just use an ISP and connect directly to the Internet.
[20:56:04] <mostlymicrobes> you can't step in that water manicennui
[20:56:06] <mostlymicrobes> it's gone
[20:56:21] <mostlymicrobes> and it's full of microbes
[20:56:30] <manicennui> I will build my own community will POTS and dial-up!
[20:56:37] <manicennui> s/will/with/
[20:56:41] <mostlymicrobes> a BBS?
[20:57:13] <manicennui> Sure.
[20:57:31] <mostlymicrobes> what will your warez be
[20:57:42] <manicennui> That concept won't be necessary.
[20:57:47] <manicennui> All software will be free.
[20:57:50] <mostlymicrobes> boo
[20:58:45] <mostlymicrobes> how many pots lines will you have
[21:01:11] <manicennui> We'll have to figure that out.
[21:01:16] <manicennui> Probably at least 4 to each home.
[21:01:36] <manicennui> Or maybe just a T1 to each home.

[21:19:30] <gwozniak> The worst part about the web3/nft crap is that people think they are actually undermining the system

[21:38:53] <buttsbot> A Cat Named Jorts Is Breaking The Internet After A Redditor Said They Were Accused Of 'Perpetuating Ethnic Stereotypes' About Orange Cats - ...
[21:38:58] <manicennui> For some reason my coworker uses digg.
[21:39:07] <manicennui> But this story is bizarre.
[21:39:16] <manicennui> The final straw came after the OP installed a "cat cutout thing in the door" and made the off-handed remark that "you can't expect Jean's tortoiseshell smarts from orange cat Jorts." The quip caused Pam to cry and go home early.
[21:39:42] <manicennui> She sent a companywide email that said that the poster was "perpetuating ethnic stereotypes by saying orange cats are dumb," and demended they take a racial sensitivity training course.
[21:40:25] <manicennui> The OP agreed to "apologize to Jorts about some things that were insensitive or disrespectful."
[21:40:29] <manicennui> hah
[21:40:34] <manicennui> I'm so sorry Jorts!
[21:40:48] <manicennui> Mostly that your name is Jorts.
[21:41:22] <manicennui> Wow. There is more, but I won't paste it.
[21:41:33] <manicennui> Jorts is probably highly entertained by all of this.
[21:41:41] <manicennui> Other than the nasty shit Pam does to him.
[21:43:55] <imode> why is digg covering reddit stories as if it's an atlantic article.
[21:44:01] <manicennui> No idea.
[21:44:06] <manicennui> Why does digg even exist anymore?
[21:44:11] <manicennui> And why does my coworker frequent it?
[21:44:29] <imode> the internet sucks
[21:44:38] <manicennui> This is life now.

[21:45:11] <manicennui> I wanna go back to the late 90s.

[21:45:23] <imode> actually yeah gimme that.
[21:45:40] <imode> I take it you're gonna watch the new one in a week.
[21:45:51] <manicennui> Eventually maybe.
[21:45:58] <manicennui> I won't go see it in theaters or anything.
[21:46:04] <manicennui> I didn't like the sequels.
[21:46:10] <manicennui> And this is probably just a cash grab.
[21:46:36] <imode> yeah.
[21:51:34] <mostlymicrobes> your coworker frequents digg?
[21:52:12] *** mostlymicrobes is now known as mostly
[21:52:18] <manicennui> Yes.

[21:52:49] <manicennui> He shares links from digg frequently.
[21:52:53] <mostly> What the Internet is talking about right now
[21:53:12] <manicennui> There was a period when digg was about as cool as reddit.
[21:53:19] <mostly> Digg, stylized in lowercase as digg, is an American news aggregator with a curated front page, aiming to select stories specifically for the Internet audience such as science, trending political issues, and viral Internet issues. Wikipedia
[21:53:21] <manicennui> Then they changed the entire site
[21:53:51] <manicennui> It formerly had been a popular social news website, allowing people to vote web content up or down, called digging and burying, respectively. In 2012, Quantcast estimated Digg's monthly U.S. unique visits at 3.8 million.[8] Digg's popularity prompted the creation of similar sites such as Reddit.[9]

[21:55:16] <manicennui> And it was sold two years later.

[23:17:52] <manicennui> I haven't worked for a company that gives Christmas bonuses... ever.
[23:18:14] <river> what the heck
[23:18:18] <river> why do they do these things
[23:18:45] <bkero> Cheap advertising
[23:18:47] <manicennui> We actually receive extra income to cover the taxes on our stupid spotlight point system.
[23:22:27] <gwozniak> I don't remember ever getting a Christmas bonus anywhere I've worked
[23:23:15] <bkero> Neither do I. I was just an intern, and interns didn't get Christmas bonuses.
[23:23:28] <manicennui> It might happen if a company's financial year ends in November.
[23:23:45] <manicennui> We get our bonuses in February or March.
[23:24:32] <manicennui> I've had bosses who give everyone on the team a bottle of wine.
