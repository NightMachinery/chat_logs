[12:25:44] <fnutt> bookworm: Just want to let you know - enyc is spamming the users in #thelounge @ Freenode about the channel has moved to Libera, and refuses to stop. This includes notices to all users and messages in channel to users joining.
[12:26:06] <fnutt> I don't think that is how we should promote the new channel.
[12:26:42] <bookworm> it's not, alas same message to you as to them. We don't control the thelounge chan on FN
[12:27:21] <fnutt> Could you please tell him/her to stop? Much appreciated.
[12:27:39] <fnutt> He/she might listen more to you than me since you're a maintainer.
[12:29:41] <bookworm> I'm not
[12:29:52] <bookworm> I have ops and package it for Arch
[12:30:00] <bookworm> but that's about it currently
[12:30:35] <bookworm> o and I fiddle with wendys internals, can't get more fun than that ;P
[12:30:55] *** Quits: iXNyNe (~NyNe@user/nyne) (Quit: iXNyNe)
[12:32:48] <bookworm> why are you even connected there to be honest
[12:33:05] <bookworm> just finally disconnect and leave the drama behind
[12:33:52] <fnutt> http://35.202.151.60:9000/uploads/5a01f1b8ba5df1ce/image.png 
[12:34:01] <fnutt> Just want to keep an eye on the channel. :)
[12:34:33] <bookworm> but why?
[12:34:45] <bookworm> we don't control it, does it even have ops?
[12:35:02] <fnutt> It does not have ops, voices or ChanServ.
[12:35:19] <bookworm> so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[12:35:34] <bookworm> even if someone does something really bad you can't do shit
[12:35:38] <bookworm> neither can we
[12:35:55] <bookworm> so, again.... /quit
[12:36:06] <bookworm> and npw you actually want the network deletion ;P
[12:36:10] <bookworm> now*
[12:39:54] <fnutt> You are aware of Max-P being voiced in #freenode?
[12:41:23] <bookworm> doesn't look like it
[12:41:30] <bookworm> they aren't joined
[12:42:10] <fnutt> #freenode @ Freenode.
[12:42:27] <bookworm> ah, that. What do I care
[12:43:03] <bookworm> but the TL chan doesn't have a topic pointing to us, so just consider it to be #chat and move on
[12:56:56] *** Joins: iXNyNe (~NyNe@user/nyne)
[13:40:44] <aab_> just get them to delete the channel it's done for now anyway users are just sitting there idle not even talking
[13:41:26] <aab_> fnutt I said that the other day and bookworm asked if there was a netsplit
