[20:24:44] <TimMc> bin: I have no idea if they're in-house or contracted. Doesn't really matter to me.
[20:24:56] <TimMc> I'm sure many of them have a choice.
[20:25:36] <bin> not necessarily
[20:25:51] <bin> for example, one of my clients is an MLM. I find most MLMs to be abhorrent
[20:25:56] <bin> I don't really have a say in it.
[20:26:14] <bin> I have to work on their site even if their business practices are predatory
[20:28:50] <TimMc> Do you, though?
[20:28:57] <TimMc> What's the nature of your work?
[20:29:36] *** Joins: GuiToris (~GuiToris@user/guitoris)
[20:30:14] <bin> No, I don't. I don't get to choose the clients.
[20:30:33] <bin> And I'm VERY vocal about how I don't like them but it's not up to me.
[20:30:56] <TimMc> Just say that it would be a conflict of interest to work for that client.
[20:30:59] <TimMc> *with
[20:31:15] <bin> no that's not how it works
[20:31:27] <GuiToris> hi
[20:31:31] <bin> hey GuiToris 
[20:32:14] <TimMc> *shrug* I don't know what your work is, but I suspect you have more power than you think.
[20:32:25] <bin> that's because you're ignorant
[20:32:37] <TimMc> Sure.
[20:32:40] <bin> I work in e-commerce for a small company.
[20:32:42] <GuiToris> I don't know this grammar, I don't exactly know what was in my mind a couple of hours ago, but something like: I did this since you last saw/see me ?
[20:33:27] <bin> I don't get a say in the clients we choose and since I'm on of the people with the skills to work on that platform, if I refused then I would lose my job since they would not have other work for me necessarily. And it would draw a dangerous line in the sand that would put me at risk.
[20:33:37] <bin> GuiToris: "saw"
[20:33:58] <GuiToris> got it, thank you
[20:34:34] <bin> no problem
[20:35:41] <TimMc> I concede that working for a small employer would limit your options.
[20:37:16] <bin> TimMc: and many recruiters work for small companies or even for themselves and also don't have a say in the clients they recruit for
[20:37:26] <bin> Of course some do, I'm not saying that they're all innocent
[20:39:04] <bin> I probably COULD be like "look guys, this business is predatory and I just can't work on it in good conscience" but then I don't know if I'd lose pay or lose my job, and I'd still have to constantly hear about it. We do have some "sin" clients (sex toys, underwear, etc) where previous employees have not worked on it, but that's a bit different and they weren't necessary for the project.
[20:42:09] <GuiToris> do you say 'have a nice week' if you expect someone to meet you this week?
[20:43:00] <TimMc> GuiToris: I might, yeah, if I were meeting them in about a week. Especially if we had a standing weekly meeting.
[20:43:41] <GuiToris> TimMc, let say, you'll meet them on Wednesday (and it's Monday now)
[20:43:59] <GuiToris> have a nice week, feel strange to me
[20:44:21] <GuiToris> I say 'have a nice weekend' when I know I won't meet someone during weekend
[20:44:33] <GuiToris> it may be just me
[20:45:56] <TimMc> Yeah, I wouldn't say "have a nice week" in that case.
[20:46:05] <TimMc> too soon
[20:46:56] <GuiToris> thanks :)
[20:47:05] <LuisR14> have a nice day!
[20:47:13] * LuisR14 stomps out
[20:48:23] <GuiToris> LuisR14, same thing, you wouldn't say, have a nice day, if you just take a tea break
[20:48:28] <bin> TimMc: just to be clear, I'm not trying to make you feel bad, just giving another perspective that sometimes people don't have many options.

[23:45:16] <LjL> <GuiToris> I was answered your statement ← you could say "I was answerING your statement", or of course "I replied" or whatever, but I'm concerned with why you thought this was correct. "I was answered" means that YOU were answered BY someone, i.e. that someone else answered you. it's passive voice. "I was answering" is active, and continuous (By doing that, I was answering your statement)
[23:46:45] <LjL> or, of course, "I answered your statement" is also active and valid, but it would be more usual to use the continuous form to state that you "were doing" something as an attempt to react to their statement
[23:47:10] <LjL> (the verb "reply" is probably better anyway because you usually "answer" a question, but I'm focusing on the verb forms)
[23:47:59] <GuiToris> I didn't even notice 'was' there :O
[23:48:05] <GuiToris> although I wrote it :/
[23:48:16] <GuiToris> thanks! :)
