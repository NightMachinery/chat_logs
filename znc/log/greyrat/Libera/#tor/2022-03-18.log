[12:12:25] <truthr> hi
[12:12:43] <truthr> anyone here from #nottor?
[12:12:57] <truthr> oftc?
[12:36:30] *** Joins: xx (~xx@user/xx)
[13:12:33] <wonko-the-sane> truthr: it's been many years since I was in #nottor... good times. iirc it was abolished, good to hear it's back
[13:14:33] <truthr> wonko-the-sane: is it back? yeah lots of good times there
[13:14:40] <wonko-the-sane> truthr: I inferred incorrectly, it's still dead "07:49 -!- wonko-the-sane was kicked from #nottor by ChanServ [#nottor is permanently shut down -- technology discussion has moved to #privacytech]
[13:15:03] <truthr> wonko-the-sane: aye..and you need to be registered to get into privacytech
[13:15:47] <truthr> wonko-the-sane: have you seen coderman?
[13:16:11] <truthr> lots of regulars there were so great
[13:16:20] <truthr> i miss em
[13:16:33] <wonko-the-sane> agreed.
[13:21:01] <wonko-the-sane> aha not only was I kicked but I was booted from oftc
[13:21:29] <wonko-the-sane> tried to create #notnottor, succeeded and was instantly kicked
[13:21:39] <wonko-the-sane> (but not disconnected)
[13:21:59] <wonko-the-sane> i've created #knottor #metanottor and #notnotnottor
[13:22:54] <wonko-the-sane> may be some OGs will stop by
[13:24:30] <truthr> #notnottor ..hahah great idea
[13:25:11] <wonko-the-sane> no notnottor also yields a kicking but unlike trying to join nottor, you dont get disconnected from oftc
[13:25:50] <wonko-the-sane> with a stern message
[13:27:32] <wonko-the-sane> I'm quite curious to learn the story of why it was shut down... and why it's verboten so brutally
[13:27:39] <wonko-the-sane> you know the story at all?
[13:33:47] <truthr> i think they did not like the way the people were becoming resistant to the woke culture
[13:34:01] <truthr> becoming supportive of trump
[13:35:34] <wonko-the-sane> fuck trump
[13:35:58] <wonko-the-sane> could you elaborate?
[13:39:48] <truthr> haha
[13:40:11] <truthr> nah...just that the channel was starting to see the wisdeom in supporting trump
[13:40:21] <truthr> and OFTC didn't like that
[13:40:31] <truthr> thus, end of channel
