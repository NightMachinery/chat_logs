[11:52:49] <The-Compiler> Dieterbe: renderer process crashes are from the underlying QtWebEngine/Chromium, there is usually little qutebrowser can do about them, unfortunately... what page is that on? Is it reproducible?
[11:54:12] <Dieterbe> it's a dashboard page from grafana. it's internal. some pages work, some don't. perhaps i can use the public wikimedia grafana instance to see if i can reproduce. 
[11:55:33] <Dieterbe> hmm the wikimedia one works fine
[11:55:45] <The-Compiler> Dieterbe: can you reproduce it when starting with --temp-basedir?
[11:55:52] <Dieterbe> is there no way to caputer some diagonstics or log output?

[11:56:23] <Dieterbe> i'll try that later. i need to go afk now.
[11:57:36] <The-Compiler> Dieterbe: you can try starting with "--debug-flag chromium", but IIRC it's quite difficult to get information on those without a debug build of QtWebEngine/Chromium
[14:03:57] <kuhilas> youtube ads blocking questions again :) The people on chrome and firefox haven't seen ads in years with ublock origin. Can I not see ads with proper adblocking within qutebrowser somehow? I tried :adblock-update and restarted browser, started a youtube video and it started with an ad.
[14:05:31] <kuhilas> with :set block I see couple options the other one having some easylist.txt couple times and the other one StevenBlack's some hosts file at github
[14:05:44] <kuhilas> other settings are set to true or auto
[14:06:25] <kuhilas> shouldn't it be using brave's adblocking, and brave can(?) block youtube ads
[14:09:24] <kuhilas> I installed python-adblock package and restarted browser and haven't seen ads yet
[14:14:31] <The-Compiler> kuhilas: installing python-adblock improves things a lot, but still won't block YouTube ads, see https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/6480
[14:14:51] <kuhilas> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9YizER4Fe4 this gave onscreen ad and after video actimel ad
[14:14:51] <kuhilas> ok
[14:16:39] <ionen> best bet is redirecting to an invidious instance or view_in_mpv userscript
[14:16:48] <ionen> (prefer youtube that way either personally)
[14:18:11] <kuhilas> I have a invidious redirect but instances sometimes don't work or lag etc. But was just wondering if qutebrowser can block too nowadays
[14:18:15] <The-Compiler> or https://old.reddit.com/r/qutebrowser/comments/ntl2ko/easy_youtube_adblocker_greasemonkey_script/h15yaqc/?context=3
[14:18:34] <ionen> ah yeah there was that too
[14:18:36] <kuhilas> I use yt-dlp installed so I launch the URL on mpv when they lag but yeah
[14:25:02] <kuhilas> trying that greasemonkey script. I put it as something.user.js in the greasemonkey dir and reloaded and saw it mentioned being loaded but when I open a youtube video I see a youtube ad with "skip add x seconds" with timer there and being ad 1 of 2. How can I skip them automatically
[14:26:23] <kuhilas> despite saying on that reddit post that you could skip add even while there is a timer it doesn't work for me. I see "Ad will end in 3" text and nothing happens when I click it
[14:33:26] <The-Compiler> I thought that's what that script did, but I'm not sure if it still works then

[14:44:22] <kuhilas> thanks for all the input and help but seems I might be getting to this once again later :D
[14:44:43] <zChris> yeah adblockinet is comming question here it seems
[14:45:14] <kuhilas> well, I am going to leave it now unredirecting to invidious for a while. I have seen the ads come now mostly after the video, which is less irritating than before the video begins
[14:45:48] <kuhilas> maybe it's bearable. I guess most qutebrowser users use the redirect to invidious or a script to open videos in a video player
[14:46:16] <zChris> yeah i have ytdownload or something similiar , cant remember now
[14:46:51] <zChris> never heard about nvidious
[14:48:58] <kuhilas> I started to now think about if I could make the browsing experience similar to qutebrowser on firefox using tridactyl. I guess this is not a good idea to discuss it here, but maybe I could ask about the differences. I have used qutebrowser for many years without using other browers at all except on android so I'm probably forgetting something that once I start to use tridactyl I notice that I don't have now this that I had in qb
[14:50:16] <The-Compiler> kuhilas: 4. at https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/blob/master/doc/faq.asciidoc has some musings on this
[14:50:45] <The-Compiler> kuhilas: and feel free to discuss other similar projects here, everyone should use whatever makes them happy :)
[14:51:08] *** Quits: sudoforge (~sudoforge@wireguard/tunneler/sudoforge) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[15:05:11] <kuhilas> wonder if those points still hold true. some 2.5 years ago or such I guess that faq entry written. Many good reviews on tridactyl. Also I'm not sure what plugins/addons I'm using on qutebrowser. Maybe should go through my config but I might be on quite bare experience
[15:12:33] <kuhilas> hmm I have customized quite many things after all just checked. Maybe I could try just for funz 
[15:12:43] <kuhilas> and see where I get stuck
[15:20:18] <The-Compiler> kuhilas: I do think they do, nothing significant changed in that time in how WebExtensions work
