Now the internet connection works fine from inside Arch Linux (the guest OS) through NAT. However, in Hyper-V Manager, the 'IP Address' field for the Arch Linux VM is empty. How can I get the IP address of the VM from Hyper-V Manager? Do I need to install something

[13:51:28] <raster> hatrix: sorry. reallife interrupted.
[13:51:55] <raster> hatrix:  so long ago ganes were onkly using core input. this meant they would lose keys that were bindings for wm's wg ... alt+tab etc.
[13:52:34] <raster> while you actually want this to happen - manyt wm's have lots of varying bindings and games dont know what to avoid and not to avoid, so there was a move especially in proton to now use xinput whihc can listen all the time
[13:53:02] <raster> so what proton is doing is it STOPS caring about key events if the window loses focus
[13:53:13] <raster> and starts caring when it gains focus... or SHOULD
[13:53:19] <raster> at least that is what happens here
[13:53:27] <raster> (also if the mouse leaves the window it stops caring etc.)
[13:55:01] <raster> i have seen some bugs with various iterations/versions of proton regarding this ... like the bleeding edge proton seemed to have issues so i'm using a  slightly older one.
[13:57:13] <raster> and yeah - you have some driver bugs there. it may not even be mesa but depper down - the scanout may be messing up and literally scanning out rows of pixels incorrectly (eg for those lines it's just outputting a single value). i'd normally expect gpu rendering bugs to have more of a tiled problem rather than linear scans which implies its more to the display end of the pipe.
[13:57:18] <hatrix> I did downgrade to a previous proton version that was working, but the issue is still there

[13:59:41] <thingfish> I have better luck with Proton-GE, guys.
[13:59:48] <hatrix> ok, I'm doing a system update and I'll reboot and try 5.13-6

[14:00:56] <phrik> Title: glitch (at streamable.com)
[14:01:18] <raster> if you dont see those line glitches in a screenshot... then your issue is well after mesa - it's probably in the kernel drm driver as that sets up the display modes and timings etc. as i suspect your issue is down there.
[14:01:22] <hatrix> I got no idea if the video is glitchy or not, can't see the glitches through the glitches

[14:02:04] <raster> if the issues are in the screenshot then the isue is in the rendering pipeline and literally it's writing that junk to the framebuffer and it still could be clocks and timings .. or could be somethnig else.

[14:04:32] <raster> ie the framebuffer contains perfectly fine info. its the process of reading that data and producing a signal that is barfing.
[14:04:36] <netsan> Hi guys - i'm really trying to understand the makepkg --syncdeps usage... according to the wiki  "To build the package and install needed dependencies, add the flag -s/--syncdeps:" - however things still failing and requiering me to manually install dependencies? --> https://bpa.st/7UGA

[14:05:01] <hatrix> oh ok, how can I debug what's happening? logs, or something?
[14:05:12] <raster> so either driver problem as i said - clocks and memory timings can sometimes do thnigs like the glitches you show... or literally your hardware has problems and no software is going to magically fix broken hw :)

[18:46:43] <MacGyver> In your case, a minimal configuration could have "title arch", "linux /vmlinuz-linux", "initrd /initramfs-linux.img", "options root=UUID=153d1a0a-420e-480f-8e61-044e86b8a53e rw"

[18:49:35] <jamesp> the esp is once again /boot, just to be sure, right?
[18:49:39] <MacGyver> jamesp: Once you've made one, it's a matter of copying it over and changing the paths to the kernel and initramfs accordingly.
[18:49:46] <MacGyver> Yes, the ESP is mounted on /boot.
[18:49:57] <MacGyver> But in your systemd-boot entries you don't list that explicitly anywhere.
[18:50:11] <MacGyver> The right place for the boot entries is /boot/loader/entries/*.conf
[18:50:46] <MacGyver> But the paths *in* those entries are "relative to the root of the ESP", so /vmlinuz-linux for the kernel, not /boot/vmlinuz-linux.

[22:12:25] <Hello71> lol
[22:12:51] <jamesp> like "options root=dev"? Arch says "you will need at least root=dev if booting Linux."

[22:16:20] <jamesp> fine.
[22:16:47] <zbe> jamesp, you can try adding 'initrd /intel-ucode.img' or amd, whichever you use. (Didnt read whole convo, just saw something about microcode)
[22:16:57] <jamesp> *facepalm* sorry thrice
[22:16:58] <ahmubashshir> jamesp: 'linux' is for using with vmlinuz-* file
[22:17:40] <ahmubashshir> 'efi' is for efi executables like shell64.efi/memtest-86.efi/xen.efi
[22:17:52] <micah_> Hey guys, will my account be removed if I don't chat for a long time?
[22:18:21] <ahmubashshir> I don't think so... if you don't drop your nick.
