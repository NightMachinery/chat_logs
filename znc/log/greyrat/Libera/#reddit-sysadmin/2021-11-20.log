[00:05:52] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: House flies aren‚Äôt really fans of rushing to the hospital to give birth. Their chosen method is rather disgusting as well. House flies will lay their eggs on items such as feces, rotting carcasses, and decaying fruit. Why is this? Well, it‚Äôs mainly to provide the larvae (maggots) with something to eat when they hatch.
[00:05:53] <Hunterkll> what?

[00:05:57] <Hunterkll> oh that's whatever
[00:05:58] <a1> !flyfact
[00:05:58] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Thats right, house flies can see behind them and it‚Äôs all to do with their amazing eyes! Unlike human beings, house flies have compound eyes. These intricate eyes provided them with nearly a 360-degree field of view, which allows them to see behind themselves. Unlike ours, the eyes of a house fly dont move. Being able to see in all directions allows them to navigate while also being on the lookout for danger.

[00:24:03] <matiss> speaking of apple, anyone tried to do anything admin related, say run ansible and ssh places from m1 ipad pro?
[00:24:11] <Activ8> I see 
[00:24:16] <Hunterkll> @sysadmin here, https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/347304-heads-up-latest-bdisp-unlocker-works-fine-on-vmware-workstation-1611-version/
[00:24:18] <Hunterkll> start there i guess
[00:24:37] <Hunterkll> i have 16.1.2 instaleld, but not unlocked right now, havent had to run a macos vm in a while with all the work macs i have laying around
[00:24:51] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> yeah
[00:26:33] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> installed 16.1.2
[00:27:11] <Hunterkll> why?
[00:27:22] <Hunterkll> I just told you i've never unlocked it since i haven't had to run macos in it yet
[00:27:23] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> because it's what you mentioned
[00:27:31] <Hunterkll> so who knows if it'll work or not?
[00:27:31] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> i mean I'll update it later
[00:27:37] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> it will work
[00:27:39] <Hunterkll> you have to repatch it every upgrade
[00:27:40] <Hunterkll> lol
[00:27:43] <Hunterkll> if the patch works
[00:27:46] <Hunterkll> for that version
[00:27:46] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> oh
[00:27:50] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> oh wow
[00:28:05] <Hunterkll> it literally does binary patching of the hypervisor executables to bypass mac hardware checks
[00:28:05] <Hunterkll> lol
[00:28:27] <Hunterkll> https://github.com/paolo-projects/unlocker/releases
[00:28:28] <Hunterkll> anyway
[00:28:31] <Hunterkll> that's what you should use
[00:28:32] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> https://github.com/DrDonk/unlocker/releases
[00:28:33] <Hunterkll> fuck around with that
[00:28:35] <Hunterkll> see what happens
[00:28:36] <Hunterkll> who knows
[00:28:36] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> not this ?
[00:28:46] <Hunterkll> hell
[00:28:51] <Hunterkll> that looks like a more recently updated fork
[00:28:52] <Hunterkll> so why not
[00:30:21] <Hunterkll> also i've never tried it with hyper-v enabled, but hyper-v coexistence was added in workstation 15.5, so you can go down there and up to 16.2 and in between to fuck around and see what happens i guess
[00:31:26] <Hunterkll> like i said, fuck around and find out
[00:31:29] <Hunterkll> who knows 
[00:31:39] <Hunterkll> but if it does work, you'll have a faaaar easier time using vmware then anything else for this
[00:32:00] <Hunterkll> especially sicne you can just ru n 100% unmodified macos without fuck all changes or hacks 
[00:32:04] <Hunterkll> if you get it working
[00:32:52] <Activ8> even easier if you just buy a mac mini
[00:34:45] <Hunterkll> Woah what
[00:34:51] <Hunterkll> someone finally put in the effort???

[00:43:00] <Hunterkll> maybe
[00:43:05] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> fair enough i was thinking it was software priacy which we are not allowed to do here

[00:43:14] <DrZak> i never undrstood the idea of being obsessed about an operating system
[00:43:27] <DrZak> i couldnt give to shits about what i run
[00:43:30] <Hunterkll> @Hotmess technically speaking, you could be running windows in bootcamp, and use this to run macOS as ahyper-v guest
[00:43:30] <DrZak> why care
[00:43:32] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> DrZak: but it's for a specific application which I need to use

[00:43:46] <vinrock> NO PS!
[00:43:48] <Hunterkll> @Hotmess which is a perfectly legal usage of macOS, you just need this github repo's code to make that usage feasable

[00:46:03] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> what sector/contry?
[00:46:04] <Hunterkll> I'd tell you tools you probably might need to use, but they'll be ~10 years out of date and probably long since abandoned
[00:46:07] <Hunterkll> which could make it work or not
[00:46:25] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> because a code repo in that state

[00:46:50] <Hunterkll> @sysadmin I mean, it pretty much tells you everything you need to do

[00:47:07] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> in README.md?
[00:47:11] <Hunterkll> yes
[00:48:17] <Hunterkll> as to which bootloader i'd use these days, who knows, but i could probably jam all that shit into clover/rEFIt/rEFInd .... if any of them are even still supported since I last used them in like 2011 
[00:48:44] <Hunterkll> been ages since I cared about DSDT / SSDT table stuff too
[00:49:24] <Hunterkll> fuck last time I ran OS X bare metall/hackintosh setup was really abou t that long ago

[00:55:13] <Hunterkll> nowadays I don't have any Radeon equipped laptops so it'd be a fools errand to try
[00:55:41] <Hunterkll> eh once you get the process down with the right tools it's pretty simple, my systems were upgrade safe even

[05:48:51] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: How do house flies eat? A house fly will regurgitate digestive juices onto solid foods and these juices break down the food into small pieces, allowing them to use their mouthparts, called proboscis, to drink the meal.
[05:49:00] <a1> !flyfact
[05:49:00] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Flies don‚Äôt have teeth. Instead, they have a long tongue called a proboscis, which sucks up food like a straw. Some flies drink nectar or blood. House flies like the food we eat. When a fly lands on your lunch, it vomits on the food. Acids in the vomit dissolve the food so the fly can suck it up. Disgusting!

[10:41:32] <sd> 15<P‚ÄãandaBear> i have a DUMB question
[10:41:45] <sd> 15<P‚ÄãandaBear> i have a "ssh key", not the file but a password
[10:42:03] <sd> 15<P‚ÄãandaBear> im confused as to how i can use this, as i assume it's related to a ppk file for ssh
[10:42:09] <sd> 15<P‚ÄãandaBear> but i dont have the ppk file just the key
[10:42:22] <sd> 15<P‚ÄãandaBear> can i use the key i already have to generate a ppk

[21:02:12] <Telgareith> Hunterkll: if you're doing static just freaking use S3 type serving
[21:02:44] <Telgareith> the cost cannot be beat
[21:03:14] <Hunterkll> LOL
[21:03:19] <Hunterkll> yes, i'll tell the FAA to do just that
[21:03:21] <Hunterkll> great idea
[21:04:17] <yuken> F the FAA.
[21:04:20] <yuken> Ignore their rules.
[21:04:21] <Hunterkll> add additional costs too
[21:04:22] <technonerd> i did a hot ones wings challenge with friends, the extract ones were the deadly ones
[21:04:23] <Hunterkll> that'll be great
[21:04:38] <Telgareith> ok
[21:04:41] <Hunterkll> Telgareith: the cost absolutely can be beat 
[21:04:44] <Telgareith> gov cloud it's going to cost more
[21:04:52] <Telgareith> but for somebody like me?
[21:04:55] <Hunterkll> but nevermind - using IIS caching servers in front of apache/nginx which are handling all the dynamic aspects works well
[21:04:58] <Telgareith> and most people
[21:05:09] <Telgareith> that reminds me
[21:05:11] <Hunterkll> S3 stored assets aren't always the best performing or best answer
[21:05:30] <Telgareith> I agree
[21:05:37] <Telgareith> I made an assumption and I was wrong
[21:05:45] <Hunterkll> Well, that was just one specific example
[21:05:54] <Hunterkll> there's also in-house hosted apps, small deployments, custom shit, etc 
[21:06:11] <Hunterkll> my specific snarky answer was related to using IIS as caching reverse proxies in front of a webapp
[21:06:12] <Hunterkll> lol
[21:06:48] <Hunterkll> more analogous would be like using cloudflare in front of your website with the caching options turned on
[21:07:32] <Telgareith> I think I do that
[21:07:46] <Telgareith> I'm hosting wordpress on a vultr $2.50/mo box
[21:07:48] <yuken> Hunterkll, the heck is the purpose of a source to gate resistor on a MOSFET? Preventing electrical noise from turning it on?

[21:47:20] <Hunterkll> nowadays you ask me to do something like help configure an LTSC deployment in an office setting and i'm more likely to DDOS you or charge you an extra $350/hr or so to do  it

[21:48:32] <Hunterkll> instead of the $150/hr doing it the right way would cost :P
[21:48:41] <Activ8> lol wow I guess I need to charge more then
[21:49:15] <Hunterkll> oh if you're setting up signage, kiosks, manufacturing systems, etc, you get the $150/hr rate for LTSC also
[21:49:24] <Hunterkll> but then the idiot tax kicks in for anything it's not designed for
[21:49:40] <Hunterkll> especially since there's usually something that won't work or it can't do that you'll make me try and make it do anyway

[23:39:31] <fritzwastaken> Hunterkll: Subject: Kubernets Ingress Controller Fake Certificate
[23:39:46] <fritzwastaken> Does not instill much confindence
[23:40:18] <Cl0udNinja> I've seen all kinds of weird shit lately around the internet with certs
[23:40:33] <Hunterkll> well
[23:40:40] <Hunterkll> this isn't a well known/used URL for anything public
[23:40:49] <Hunterkll> what I actually wanted was account.microsoft.com/devices - silly me
[23:40:53] <fritzwastaken> Ive rescued over 2000 dogs working with my local rescue organization. I dont take kindly to vet rescheduling
[23:41:00] <Cl0udNinja> damn thats a lot
[23:41:04] <fritzwastaken> Promises are promises
[23:41:21] <fritzwastaken> Me and my family took over a rescue org when i was like 15
[23:41:27] <Cl0udNinja> well it was more a fuckup, the surgery was supposed to be yesterday, not today, but I only ever got an appointment confirmation for today
[23:41:39] <fritzwastaken> pets are family members
[23:41:42] <Cl0udNinja> indeed
[23:41:48] <fritzwastaken> and if you dont see if that way, you dont deserve your pet
[23:41:51] <Hunterkll> thats why i write shit down when i make/schedule appointments with my dentist lol
[23:41:53] <Hunterkll> because of shit like that
[23:42:09] <Cl0udNinja> Hunterkll, I also really remember hearing saturday during the initial talk
[23:42:10] <Cl0udNinja> so idk
[23:42:12] <Hunterkll> fritzwastaken: i mean, i've raised sea crittes before to eat.... :P
[23:42:14] <fritzwastaken> I understand things can change but still
[23:42:24] <Cl0udNinja> I guess I was supposed to get 2 confirmations, one for yesterday and for today
[23:42:27] <fritzwastaken> Dont fuck with a families emotions
[23:42:29] <Cl0udNinja> but I only ever got the one for today
[23:42:29] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: ya thats why i write shit down or even better make them write it down and hand me a card 
[23:42:32] <Hunterkll> cuz shit happens like that
[23:42:43] <Hunterkll> fritzwastaken: right, but still, they probably told him at some point and never really clicked
[23:42:49] <Hunterkll> so it's not clear that *anyone* is really at fault directly
[23:43:00] <fritzwastaken> writing shit down doesnt fix their inability to schedule surgeons properly
[23:43:05] <Hunterkll> ...
[23:43:06] <Cl0udNinja> yeah its possible, but I always get a confirmation email
[23:43:14] <Cl0udNinja> and I didnt get one
[23:43:17] <Hunterkll> almost missed my own dental appointment once cuz of this shit
[23:43:26] <Hunterkll> fritzwastaken: you're missing a huge thing here - it was scheduled, for yesterday.
[23:43:34] <Hunterkll> cloud either forgot or was never told
[23:43:39] <Cl0udNinja> ^
[23:43:40] <Hunterkll> the only scheduled thing he knew was the day after pickup
[23:43:51] <Cl0udNinja> but I also only had the one appointment in my calendar from the initial talk
[23:43:55] <Hunterkll> this isn't them failing to schedule a surgeon or whatever - the surgen was probably like "welp, a no-show, ugh"
[23:43:57] <Cl0udNinja> for today (saturday)
[23:44:07] <Cl0udNinja> yeah they told me they waited for me to show up
[23:44:12] <Cl0udNinja> to which I was very confused
[23:44:18] <Cl0udNinja> so yeah whol fuckin fiasco
[23:44:24] <fritzwastaken> I mis read, my appologies
[23:44:35] <Cl0udNinja> all good
[23:44:35] <Hunterkll> yea they coulda said something like "and you'll pick up on X day, so arrive the day before at Y time" 
[23:44:36] <fritzwastaken> I thought they mis scheduled the surgery
[23:44:41] <Hunterkll> nah
[23:44:45] <Hunterkll> just a communication breakdown somewhere 
[23:44:48] <Cl0udNinja> ^
[23:45:05] <fritzwastaken> it happens
[23:45:07] <Hunterkll> yea they coulda said something like "and you'll pick up on X day, so arrive the day before at Y time"  <-- kinda what happened with my dentist almost, i remembered the time they said i'd be done..... :P
[23:45:09] <Cl0udNinja> fritzwastaken, but yeah so anyway, hes my dude, he goes everywhere with me
[23:45:12] <Hunterkll> good thing they texted me the morning of LOL
[23:45:17] <Hunterkll> otherwise i'd have been an hour late
[23:45:46] <fritzwastaken> I use office365 for all my email and caledar shit now
