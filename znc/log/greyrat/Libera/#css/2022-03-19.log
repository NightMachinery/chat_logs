[01:08:59] <teut> how to prevent that?
[01:09:11] <teut> it's getting cut because of the footer
[01:10:37] *** Joins: AMcBain (~AMcBain@user/amcbain)
[01:24:05] <matsaman> teut: pad the bottom with padding matching footer height
[01:24:11] <matsaman> or better yet
[01:24:26] <matsaman> pad it with the entire height of the viewport (100vh)
[01:24:39] <matsaman> that way you can scroll even to the last item without it being stuck to the bottom
[01:24:48] <teut> oh nice
[01:25:12] <teut> thanks, you are really an expert
[01:25:17] <matsaman> shucks =P
[01:25:37] <matsaman> you could also do calc(100vh - heightOfSingleRowItemWhatevs) to make it extra too perfect
[01:25:43] <matsaman> not really necessary though
[01:25:55] <teut> no , padding is a much better idea
[01:26:07] <teut> not required*
[01:26:43] <matsaman> oh I mean, you can use calc with padding, as the value
[01:26:47] <matsaman> but it's overkill
[01:27:27] <teut> there is scroll padding
[01:27:38] <teut> you know what it does?
[01:30:28] <teut> padding is not working
[01:30:38] <teut> did it work for you?
[01:31:27] <matsaman> padding will work fine
[01:31:29] <matsaman> 1min
[01:32:33] <teut> also when I hard coded the height to be 80vh
[01:32:46] <teut> why is it hiding then?
[01:32:53] <matsaman> mmm, this is some react trash =P
[01:33:53] <teut> https://dpaste.org/nAQu
[01:33:54] <teut> yep
[01:35:03] <matsaman> what's the footer container?
[01:35:27] <teut> line 5
[01:35:39] <matsaman> 'footer' element?
[01:35:58] <teut> that is the html corresponding to the footer
[01:36:03] <teut> a react component
[01:36:27] <matsaman> for example: body > * > * > * { padding-bottom: 100vh; }
[01:36:28] <matsaman> works fine
[01:36:48] <matsaman> no idea offhand what element to select; your HTML is unreadable, because you're using react.js
[01:37:13] <teut> ya , I get your point, rendered html becomes unreadable
[01:38:16] <teut> https://dpaste.org/tc4V
[01:38:58] <teut> most of react is just that you can assign html to variables

[04:38:39] <Shortstop> gotcha

[04:44:28] <Shortstop> Its bothering the heck out of me why its off by a line
[04:44:35] <hmw[at]> ah in that case you want to turn that h3 into a pre
[04:45:47] <hmw[at]> Shortstop: text-align center, I'd suppose. You should center the <p> itself, not its contents. I'll try to make a fiddle for you.
[04:46:01] <Shortstop> technically I can do a pure pre-block with Emacs alone
[04:46:04] <Shortstop> within a source block
[04:46:14] <Shortstop> however, if I do that, then I get all the styling by default which I don't want
[04:46:26] <Shortstop> hard to describe but that default rectangle with the tag of what language it is

[04:56:19] <Shortstop> that's normal though

[04:56:28] <hmw[at]> Feels like defeat :)
[04:58:18] <hmw[at]> Shortstop: Note that the first \n after <h3> becomes visible content. You'd have to move the first line up to the very same line.
[04:59:24] <hmw[at]> Shortstop: Try adding line-height: 1;  to h3
[05:02:17] <hmw[at]> Yay, you got a web ring <3
[05:02:33] <Shortstop> I exported the page, but its still doing that weird cutoff
[05:02:45] <Shortstop> oh gotcha, i'll try your variant of the ASCII
[05:02:48] <Shortstop> I think that's the issue
[05:04:01] <hmw[at]> Shortstop: Remove all tags inside <h3>.  <p> can't be a child of h3 anyways

[05:16:30] <hmw[at]> Shortstop: Your markup is suboptimal. I'd remove the <form>s altogehter and replace the buttons with <button>. I also would assign display:inline-block; to that <pre>, so you can center it like I did in the fiddle. Same goes for your buttons, I'd put them in an <ul> and make the <li>s inline-block as well.
[05:17:35] <hmw[at]> Also, if you can, reduce your markup. Wrappers are causing more headache than they help in many cases.
[05:18:18] <hmw[at]> That'd be <span>s where you don't really need them, nested <p> that don't really designate paragraphs, etc. In short, make semantic markup. See also:
[05:18:20] <hmw[at]> `divitis
[05:18:21] <Selvvir> hmw[at], Divitis is when you use tons of <div>s when you don't have to. Create the HTML for the page first, THEN style it. The fewer elements you have, the fewer problems you have.
[05:19:30] <Shortstop> I'm too much of a fan of emacs to give up the ease of being able to just write in Org mode and hit export
[05:19:51] <hmw[at]> I get that part, but I don't use Emacs, so I have no clue how nasty this is

[17:16:48] <hmw[at]> hassoon_: I'd advise adding more coffee. 2 cups is clearly not enough. Also, sleep is for mortals anyways.
[17:20:23] <hassoon_> hmw[at]: what ? did you ascend or something ? I'd become a sick zombie if I ever follow your opinion
[17:20:46] <hmw[at]> Oh. I thought you were a programmer :)
[17:20:53] <hassoon_> i always need a decent amount of sleep for a productive day
[17:21:05] <hassoon_> sure, a programmer's asset is their mind
[17:21:43] <hmw[at]> Ideally, we'd go without caffein altogehter, I guess
[17:22:08] <hassoon_> yep, we don't depend on it anyway
[17:22:18] <hmw[at]> Hm. I do :(
[17:22:32] <hassoon_> but it's nice to drink some coffee in some coffee shop outdoors under the sunlight
[17:22:51] <hmw[at]> Heh. Definitively.
[17:23:31] <hmw[at]> Dang, my cup is empty, again.

[19:46:58] <pavonia> Depends on the client. Should be something about 1.2 on most systems
[20:07:30] <magga> pavanoia: okay, whats that in pixels?
[20:07:31] <magga> 17?
[20:08:40] <pavonia> That in turn depends on the current font size
[20:08:57] <pavonia> Why do you need the exact value?
[20:10:01] <magga> im making a site from a figma design file
[20:10:50] <magga> and in the figma design it allways have the line-height: 24px;
[20:11:01] <magga> im wondering if thats just default, since every element has it
[20:19:11] *** Joins: dpuerto (~dpuerto@136-27-83-52.cab.webpass.net)
[20:20:28] <pavonia> I guess that's to have the same default on every client
[20:20:38] <magga> i see:)
