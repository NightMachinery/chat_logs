[00:38:32] <Fieldy> so... i'm seeing l4s hits in my honeypots. i guess i don't understand how to fetch these ldap "urls". curl, when compiled with ldap support, supposedly can do it, but i haven't got it to actually complete yet. am I doing something wrong:
[00:38:49] <Fieldy> curl -v --user-agent f "ldap://45.130.229.168:1389/Exploit"
[00:38:49] <Fieldy> *   Trying 45.130.229.168:1389...
[00:39:05] <Fieldy> never get anything back, tried lots of the "urls" pretty soon after the attempts
[00:39:50] <marder> hmmm
[00:40:00] <Fieldy> then again the host is timing out on that port anyway (netcat)
[00:40:21] <marder> misconfigured or a test?
[00:40:24] <Fieldy> could be down or getting so many stage2 hits (what these are as far as i can tell) as to be slow

[01:14:20] <marder> jkk, pls
[01:14:38] <jkk> marder, well maybe someone can post a howto :P
[01:14:43] <Fieldy> are you seeing a *slight* uptick in how many you're seeing? up until now it was maybe 2 or 3 a day on a major hosting netblock IP, now it's 3 or 4 an hour
[01:15:47] <Fieldy> that is my favorite stage in the evolution, watching things change and kiddies adjust things
[01:15:53] <marder> netblock, ok
[01:16:03] <marder> will take some time
[01:16:10] <ljubomir51> mmm, how many hosts are we talking about that are affected by this vuln?
[01:16:16] <ljubomir51> couple thousand?
[01:16:18] <Fieldy> we don't know, it's f*cktons
[01:16:21] <jkk> who cares hack them all
[01:16:24] <jkk> delete their data
[01:16:27] <ljubomir51> yes
[01:16:29] <Fieldy> as it's an extremely heavily used product
[01:16:29] <ljubomir51> of course
[01:16:50] <jkk> if you find a vuln like this simply make a bot to access and delete data
[01:17:02] <jkk> well most would have a backup
[01:17:08] <ljubomir51> I know, there's one in development, maybe...
[01:17:18] <Fieldy> i need to get off my lazy ass and get all the logs into this ELK stack which is part of this honeypot
[01:17:20] <ljubomir51> I needed moar proxies
[01:17:22] <Fieldy> from all my systems
[01:17:29] <ljubomir51> hence why I wrote some C&C in golang and the client code in golang, too
[01:17:39] <jkk> why report vulns, delete all data or something
[01:17:42] <ljubomir51> it has been working for well, and it will be great once the SSH bruteforcing code is in there
[01:17:44] <Fieldy> lol well it's an arbitrary remote command execution vuln, you can damn near do anything
[01:17:45] <ljubomir51> yes
[01:18:02] <ljubomir51> tor fallback servers and all.... hehe
[01:18:11] <Fieldy> if i were a bad guy(TM) i'd be having a grand time. ssh tunnels/proxies/god knows what else

[01:18:43] <jkk> report 0 vulns
[01:18:47] <Fieldy> yeah i hate java with a passion

[01:20:40] <Fieldy> i had their AS's firewall blocked until recently, i removed them hoping for hits on l4s

[01:24:38] <jkk> Fieldy, don't do honey pots, simply hack something and make money this way :)
[01:24:44] <jkk> it is better
[01:25:24] <ljubomir51> be sure to use colocrossing for the mining pool host
[01:25:36] <ljubomir51> not like they have a history of ignoring abuse reports...
[01:25:48] <ljubomir51> and then scamming lowendtalk users with sub-brands... before buying the site, that is
[01:26:52] <jkk> ljubomir51, as per god idea many dont want to work and run all kind of scams
[01:27:05] <ljubomir51> yep
[01:27:30] <ljubomir51> but honestly when users will click on crap/fall for drive by download sites, etc., I don't blame them

[04:21:54] <tomba4032> what if someone chains you up and hits you with a hammer until you give up your private key
[04:22:00] <jkk> idea is to use what is surely private and build from there

[04:28:36] <mats1> unless, i guess, its a brain wallet in the buttcoin style
[04:28:42] <jkk> tomba4032, for a moment - person sending pgp encrypted emails using wifi - laptop is used only for that purpose - second person does same - their communication is private
[04:29:11] <jkk> tomba4032, surely people can learn from what you say to even further expand their privacy
[04:29:25] <Disconsented> If they're going that far they probably have access
[04:29:39] <jkk> who is going far?
[04:29:45] <tomba4032> yeah then that would be pretty secure, but what about if some exploit is found for your email client? what if WPA2/3 is cracked at some point in the future? The attack surface is wider than it looks at first glance
[04:30:05] <jkk> f WPA2/3 is cracked at some point - pgp

[04:48:26] <tomba4032> For the public it is difficult though as 'user-friendly' stuff like WhatsApp or whatever will have to remove encryption if it continues at this trajectory

[05:58:14] <EdFletcher> but yeah if you really need it, elasticsearch will do the trick for sure
[05:58:43] <Hydragyrum> the speed bottleneck when doing *grep is going to be disk i/o unless you've got a really slow cpu, if you've got multiple searches to run on the same data you could do some magic with pipes to avoid doing the same i/o more times than needed
[05:59:29] <mats1> it doesn't make sense to grep decompressed data, right
[06:00:05] <Hydragyrum> right, the compression will speed it up in most cases because less data needs to be read to/from disk

[23:13:23] <MadCamel> Alright, I'm officially over #Log4J. Not saying anything in my org is patched. Just saying I'm done worrying about it & am moving on w/my life. Y'all need to stop living in fear. Just accept that exploits happen & if it's your company's time to be breached, it's their time.
