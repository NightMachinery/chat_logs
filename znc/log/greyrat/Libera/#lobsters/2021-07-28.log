[00:14:59] <bruno366[m]> yeah I can imagine, I haven't used it either, but the examples in the article are explained well enough
[00:16:03] <bruno366[m]> I would imagine that (since it seems to add annotations to C code), one could incrementally specify as little or as much as one wants
[00:17:35] <bruno366[m]> For example, one could choose to just use one of the plugins
[00:17:35] <bruno366[m]> > Frama-C has four core plug-ins: Eva, which focuses on detecting undefined behaviors; WP, which aims to prove functional properties; E-ACSL, which checks properties at runtime; and PathCrawler, which generates test cases.

[00:37:54] <bruno366[m]> hmm, seems like checked C by microsoft adds more type checking to C, and looking at the examples I would assume checked C needs its own compiler https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc/tree/master/samples while in Frama-C the spec-annotations are added as comments so it should work with any C compiler

[16:46:34] <epilys> personally I wasn't talking about "content" but social activity in general

[16:49:48] <ignaloidas> and I did see a decrease in activity in some social circles
[16:50:06] <ignaloidas> but for example fediverse has been blooming over the last while
[16:50:17] <Ristovski> I've noticed this locally in europe in the last couple of months, and its due to people finally being able to go on vacation, hence less "productive" content online being posted by them

[22:54:17] <bkero> Or CI, that shit's hard.
[22:54:50] <gwozniak> Yes, well, they tend to write everything using MISRA C, which apparently qualifies
[22:55:54] <gwozniak> CI for hardware/firmware teams is a bit more of a challenge.  I think most of our internal customers are doing it in some way

[23:02:54] <technomancy> I'd be impressed to see forth on a CV
[23:02:59] <varjag> imo it's more an urban legend
[23:03:00] <pja>  Defense will at least know about Ada (usually).
[23:03:05] <technomancy> specifically because no one uses it at work
[23:03:06] <varjag> (ada used anywhere in numbers)
[23:03:13] <pja> & there’s assurance tooling out there for it.
