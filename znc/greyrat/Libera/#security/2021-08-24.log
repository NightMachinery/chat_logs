[00:14:44] <Hash> I did a comp sci bachelors 16 years ago and i forgot a lot so masters is you pay out of pocket

[00:15:22] <Hash> so it was more easier to refresh my memory, have gov pay for most of it, and get a bachelors in cybersecurity this time, insetad of general comp sci whcih i aldready did

[00:15:53] <Hash> After this, get a job, make some money and then do masters or see if I want/need to, if it adds value to my life
[00:16:44] <Hash> And my interest shifted from doing full stack dev to want to do security and I figure I already know webdev so I can learn security and combine the two and figure something in that domain.
[00:17:42] <Hash> I don't want to make software anymore. \o/ At least for a while anyway. Plus, almost free school, minimal loans, why not.
[00:18:04] <Hash> Masters, gov only grants and does all that for undergrad. graduate school is out of pocket mostly or expensive loans.

[00:31:01] <jnaleg> Hi, is using the application `firejail` goo enough to protect against exploits on websites or does a disposable VM gives much added security in that regard?
[00:31:05] <jnaleg> good*

[00:35:54] <piou> jnaleg: It's really good at protecting you from most issues. A VM might be a bit better for very high-level attacks but I don't think it's worth the trouble over firejail unless you have a particular reason to want to go that extra mile (particularily sensitive data, reason to expect to be targeted for an attack...)
[00:38:20] <agonzal> jnaleg: depending on your environment, you can 'escape' firejail' through dbus.

[00:40:51] <jnaleg> piou, Thanks, that would make things much easier, because setting up a performant KVM/QEMU VM with clipboard and high resolution display support is a bit cumbersome. Though I see there is a lot development and if you compile QEMU yourself you can already make use of virgil3d
