[00:01:07] <GNUmer> tpefreedom: Doesn't Osboot have the ME cleaner though. I hear It's not possible to completely disable it on an X230 but neutering it is possible.
[00:01:51] <tpefreedom> It is still on the chip. I think libreboot refuses to support stuff with intel ME.
[00:03:48] <GNUmer> tpefreedom: At least for me, neutered ME is better than full ME.
[00:04:51] <tpefreedom> Yes
[00:04:55] <tpefreedom> I agree
[00:05:08] <tpefreedom> No ME would still be nicer than any ME.
[00:05:50] <tpefreedom> currently I'm on a dell from 2013 or 2014 but when this thing eventually breaks I think I'll move to something w/o ME at all.
[00:09:35] <Noisytoot> <tpefreedom> It is still on the chip. I think libreboot refuses to support stuff with intel ME.
[00:09:35] <Noisytoot> libreboot refuses to support stuff where Intel ME cannot be fully removed.
[00:09:48] <Noisytoot> The ThinkPad X200 has ME, but libreboot fully removes it.
[00:11:25] <tpefreedom> ah
[00:11:26] <tpefreedom> ok
[00:13:10] <saintwatermelon> Have you tried libreCMC?

[06:26:22] <tpefreedom> What about free hardware designs you load onto an fpga?
[06:26:46] <DiffieHellman> The free hardware design is free, the FGPA hardware is not.
[06:28:07] <DiffieHellman> A huge chunk of hardware does not work without proprietary software and it's more worthwhile to focus on those than the rare hardware than doesn't need any proprietary software.

[07:44:55] <myrcy> whats up?
[07:45:39] <tpefreedom> hi
[07:49:35] <kittyblam> eh, plastic 3d printers are overrated, things like metal make sense tho. plastic should really be abolished except for where its *absolutely* necessary, you can just give a tutorial for how to make nearly anything plastic out of wood or bamboo or seed or something and it will be fine, the real problem with free hardware is things that currently you need a multimillion or multibillion dollar setup to reprodu
[07:49:35] <kittyblam> ce
[07:49:53] <kittyblam> filler materials are already trivial, complex electronics needs much more investment

[08:38:32] <DiffieHellman> kittyblam: Metal 3D printers tend to be under tight control, as you can make reliable firearms with them.
[08:42:57] <tpefreedom> Well, is there a type of metal that would make for good electronics but bad weapons?
[08:43:09] <tpefreedom> If there is such a metal it would be very useful for 3d printing.
[08:44:25] <DiffieHellman> Ehh, if it can melt copper, with a bit of tweaking it will melt steel as well.
[08:47:50] <tpefreedom> Well which one has the lower melting temp?
[08:47:57] <DiffieHellman> Copper
[08:48:02] <tpefreedom> Or what about gold?
[08:49:24] <DiffieHellman> Gold melts at a ~20C lower temperature.
[08:50:56] <DiffieHellman> There's tin with a nice low melting point, but that's not very good for electronics tbh.
[08:51:33] <DiffieHellman> Lead is probably the best bet, but RoHS will hate you.

[21:31:22] <GNUHacker> you dont need TorBrowser to run tor network
