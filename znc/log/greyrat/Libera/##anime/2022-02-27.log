[06:40:36] <ButterNoodle> nice
[06:40:48] <jessedesu2> It's not much different than an exacto
[06:41:18] <jessedesu2> But I am aware it's easier to slice your skin with it
[06:41:39] <amigojapan> emmeka: I guess they are just hungry
[06:42:01] <emmeka> birds are assholes
[06:42:07] <emmeka> like the mighty Canada Goose
[06:42:08] <amigojapan> yup
[06:42:20] <emmeka> noted for its violence
[06:42:29] <jessedesu2> Do birds have alliances
[06:42:45] <ButterNoodle> yea its a conspiracy from aviansexuals to spread the cats are assholes memes...
[06:42:48] <amigojapan> emmeka: at least hawks, or tombi or whatever, are only on the beach as far as I can tell
[06:42:51] <jessedesu2> If you attack one you attack all
[06:43:01] <amigojapan> jesse they do
[06:43:07] <ButterNoodle> cats are the answer
[06:43:13] <ButterNoodle> cats with jetpacks
[06:43:15] <emmeka> amigojapan hmmm. I wonder if they're osprey
[06:43:32] <amigojapan> jesse no, I mean, they come in groups to attack you
[06:43:36] <emmeka> we have a type of hawk called osprey that only eat fish, they are usually found exclusively near water
[06:43:56] <jessedesu2> Osprey is a brand of something
[06:43:58] <jessedesu2> I forget
[06:44:04] <jessedesu2> Microwaves?
[06:44:08] <emmeka> amigojapan the only wild animal that ever actually did damage to me in the woods was a turkey
[06:44:09] <amigojapan> emmeka: I can only ask the dictionary, let me see

[06:44:19] <emmeka> they're just dinosaurs jealous that mammals won
[06:44:25] <ButterNoodle> yea
[06:44:39] <ButterNoodle> keep shittin out them eggs loosers
[06:44:54] <emmeka> I was traipsing through the woods at like idk 10 years old and stepped through a shrub. said shrub contained a turkey nest. mama turkey was very displeased with my intrusion.

[06:45:42] <amigojapan> emmeka: apparently osprey is misago in japanese, and the kind that attacked me is a kite
[06:45:50] <emmeka> ah.
[06:45:53] <amigojapan> not a hawk, tho the difference is small
[06:45:56] <jessedesu2> Kitte
[06:46:03] <emmeka> I didn't know misago were osprey!
[06:46:23] <jessedesu2> What is postage stamp in japanese
[06:46:34] <ButterNoodle> is it pronounced „Åç„Å£„Å¶
[06:47:05] <amigojapan> yeah its kitte jesse, kite is an english word
[06:47:18] <amigojapan> jesse emmeka kite is tombi in japanese
[06:47:39] <jessedesu2> Nice, bi toms
[06:47:46] <jessedesu2> Bi tomboys
[06:48:05] <emmeka> people tend to build nests for osprey where I grew up, they want to nest very high up and exposed to the elements so people put up poles with platforms on them near water
[06:48:05] <jessedesu2> Most likely a thing
[06:48:18] <amigojapan> jesse I assume the bird is what the toy is named after
[06:48:22] <emmeka> they have a nice cry, not like most birds of prey
[06:49:17] <jessedesu2> !findquote cry turn on
[06:49:17] <ImoutoBot> jessedesu2: (25 / 57) <jessirelli> you can cry on my shoulder but i can't gaurantee that i wont be turned on by it (4 more)
[06:49:21] <amigojapan> emmeka: kites also have a prtty special cry, which japanese onomotopeia is "piiihyororororo"

[10:12:57] <ButterNoodle> or that nasty cheap shit...
[10:13:11] <ButterNoodle> matcha everything sounds great

[10:13:39] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: real wasabi is rare and expensive

[10:16:34] <ButterNoodle> sashimi is just not filling wo some rice tho
[10:16:45] <matt|home> hungry..
[10:16:56] <matt|home> had a big dinner.. want late night snack.. 
[10:17:10] <jessedesu2> Akebi is so gosh darn cute
[10:17:20] <ButterNoodle> some south chinese ran a nice place in downtown louisville that I use to go to for lunch/dinner a lot
[10:17:44] <ButterNoodle> I'd eat nigiri at the bar while they made my ramen :3
[10:18:23] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: I think I asked u before about uzari - raw quail egg

[10:19:50] <amigojapan> :)
[10:20:23] <ButterNoodle> now I want sushi
[10:20:33] <matt|home> .. yeah i still absolutely detest actual japanese culture
[10:20:38] <matt|home> it really is just fucking toxic horseshit
[10:20:46] <ButterNoodle> ?
[10:20:53] <ButterNoodle> u forgot the /s
[10:21:07] <jessedesu2> Matt why are you always opening with negativity
[10:21:11] <matt|home> so this is just my opinion.. but since manga and anime are japan's #1 export basically
[10:21:18] <matt|home> well hear me out and then i'll play devil's advocate for a bit
[10:21:23] <ButterNoodle> naa
[10:21:45] <amigojapan> probably cars are the nunmber one export
[10:22:03] <ButterNoodle> ur opinion doesnt matter unles u can agree anime tiddies are the 2nd greatest thing to cum out of japan
[10:22:05] <jessedesu2> Cars and porn
[10:22:10] <matt|home> the most consumed and popular manga tend to reflect the reader's preferences.. like i was watching an anime about this hardcore otaku who plays video games ignoring everyone including his magical girl guardian angel
[10:22:21] <matt|home> and it was like #1 for fucking months
[10:22:49] <matt|home> beat out all the other esoteric and deep/thought provoking storylines.. because that's probably the kind of people who watch that shit :\
[10:22:57] <amigojapan> matt|home: manga does not reflect on real japanese culture much
[10:23:05] <matt|home> so instead of new material i just see the same things over and over
[10:23:15] <ButterNoodle> matt|home: sex sells
[10:23:18] <matt|home> same with hollywood movies, the US is not immune to this.. BUT
[10:23:24] <matt|home> hollywood panders to the chinese audience, not just the US
[10:23:26] <ketchupicecream> amigojapan: Yeah they're catered to horny teenagers
[10:23:43] <matt|home> right. fucking lucky star beat out goddamn astro boy
[10:23:46] <matt|home> you know
[10:23:51] <matt|home> the anime made by literally the father of anime
[10:23:51] <amigojapan> ketchupicecream: some of them are, Idont like those
[10:24:05] <jessedesu2> Ketchup and Mac n cheese tastes good together according to some who have tried it
[10:24:06] <matt|home> gets beat by: cute girls doing cute girl things
[10:24:40] <amigojapan> matt|home: lucky star is not mainstream, astro boy was
[10:24:54] <ketchupicecream> jessedesu2: how about on hot dogs?
[10:25:00] <matt|home> now i love some of my tropes.. reincarnation storylines are some of my favorite and there are way too many of them i admit
[10:25:00] <amigojapan> matt|home: basically japanese people dont know lucky star
[10:25:37] <jessedesu2> I never heard of hot dogs and ketchup together
[10:25:39] <matt|home> it's just all the shit anime and manga i've seen make me feel hatred towards yellow skinned people because i know a lot of them act like that in real life. yes that was intentional.
[10:26:12] <matt|home> also i have a lot of great ideas and zero artistic talent and nobody wants to draw for me for free so im jealous -_-
[10:26:21] <ketchupicecream> jessedesu2: Apparently it's an abomination, like pineapple on pizza. But I liked hot sauce on hot dogs
[10:26:42] <ketchupicecream> matt|home: says an isekai enjoyer
[10:26:48] <amigojapan> matt|home: dont call them yellow skinned peoople that is racist and wont be tollerated here
[10:26:55] <matt|home> well to be fair i only think like
[10:27:03] <matt|home> 3 of them are good, the rest are trash. it's my guilty people
[10:27:05] <matt|home> guilty pleasure
[10:28:27] <matt|home> im a bit sad though.. i have _yet_ to see my favorite female archetype in anything i've ever read
[10:28:34] <jessedesu2> I just read some foxnews user comments about how the US is training Chinese students in STEM to beat us at our own game

[10:34:39] <ButterNoodle> and apple II
[10:34:40] <amigojapan> yeah
[10:34:53] <amigojapan> the mac version is probably the best version
[10:35:10] <amigojapan> the ms dos version was color, but I liked the black and white better
[10:35:28] <matt|home> anyone know of any anime or manga who's MC is like a crass/crude ass-scratching chick by any chance? i really never found that archetype. the _absolute closest_ i got was that weird one where the MC was this mother who turned into a monster to defend her family or something. blade? blood something? idk
[10:37:13] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: so you had a mac way back? I emulated it on amiga
[10:37:23] <ButterNoodle> I did in school
[10:37:27] <amigojapan> nice
[10:37:41] <ButterNoodle> I had apple IIc at home, and then commodore 128 after that

[10:39:46] <ButterNoodle> yea thats the problem.. leaky caps
[10:40:29] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: I wonder if it is possible ot use solid state capacitors to replace the liquid ones, so that problem does not happen again
[10:40:49] <jessedesu2> There's a pic on the news of what seems like a 10-12 year old girl with an ak47
[10:40:50] <ButterNoodle> yes
[10:40:56] <jessedesu2> Slightly disturbing
[10:41:07] <ButterNoodle> jessedesu2: invasion is a scary thing

[10:41:41] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: they dont stand a chance tho
[10:41:52] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: I replaced all the electrolytic caps on my old kenwood ham radio with solid state ones
[10:42:03] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: nope.. it is unfortunate
[10:42:04] <amigojapan> or maybe htey do, since the US lost vietnam
[10:42:20] <ButterNoodle> russia has moved nukes in position
[10:42:27] <ButterNoodle> no sane country is going to step in
[10:42:28] <amigojapan> very nice ButterNoodle, I need to do it for my family computer
[10:43:05] <jessedesu2> I need a dirtbike to escape fallout dust
[10:43:08] <ButterNoodle> the US is already strengthening forces in eastern Europe..
[10:43:13] <ButterNoodle> jessedesu2: u breathe it ur dead
[10:43:39] <jessedesu2> I either die at the epicenter of the blast
[10:43:47] <jessedesu2> Or escape intact
[10:44:12] <ButterNoodle> hopefully louisville is not a target.. since they moved armor out of ft knox the only thing there is the gold vault
[10:44:21] <ButterNoodle> not a strategic nuclear target
[10:44:30] <amigojapan> I hope we dont go thru a whole new cold war again
[10:44:31] <ButterNoodle> there is a federal building in louisville tho
[10:44:40] <ButterNoodle> we are already amigojapan
[10:44:47] <jessedesu2> I wonder if there's a Russian nuke pointed at SF
[10:44:47] <amigojapan> ouch ButterNoodle
[10:44:52] <ButterNoodle> russia and china are partnered up
[10:44:58] <ButterNoodle> they will help each other
[10:44:58] <jessedesu2> I mean, they got 7000
[10:45:09] <amigojapan> jessedesu2: does san fransisco have military targets?
[10:45:13] <jessedesu2> There's probably at least several
[10:45:15] <ButterNoodle> and the rest of the world will walk on egg shells bc china makes everything
[10:45:21] <ButterNoodle> yea
[10:45:42] <ButterNoodle> there are a lot of strategic military installations around san fran
[10:45:55] <amigojapan> I see
[10:46:01] <jessedesu2> SF is defended by the air national guard in Fresno I think
[10:46:04] <amigojapan> then it is a likely target
[10:46:16] <jessedesu2> SF has tech related targets
[10:46:24] <jessedesu2> Twitter is downtown
[10:46:26] <amigojapan> yeah I wonder how effective anti missile missiles are
[10:46:33] <ButterNoodle> I mean san Diego is 500 miles away...
[10:46:58] <jessedesu2> Vandenburg
[10:47:22] <ButterNoodle> sfo is a huge airport
[10:47:29] <jessedesu2> Is there still a navy base in seattle
[10:47:30] <amigojapan> jesse I dont think tech is usually something that is targeted, at least I have not heard of that in previous wars
[10:47:35] <ButterNoodle> yep
[10:48:04] <ButterNoodle> well we are in the info age amigojapan.. I could imagine strategic bombings of key peering points
[10:48:16] <ButterNoodle> that takes some intelligence
[10:48:24] <amigojapan> I see ButterNoodle
[10:48:52] <ButterNoodle> but tbh

[10:51:45] <amigojapan> how can they beat the US?
[10:52:11] <ButterNoodle> I mean u can say those words.. but anyone that has over 5000 nuclear warheads is someone I wouldnt want to play with
[10:52:26] <amigojapan> I see
[10:52:38] <ButterNoodle> and russia has pulled this shit before already
[10:52:43] <jessedesu2> Teenage girls with guns seems kinda cool on paper and jpegs, but in the context of real war I am actually worried for them
[10:52:45] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: cant they be stopped using anti missile misiles?
[10:52:55] <ButterNoodle> idk..
[10:53:12] <jessedesu2> I say 50/50
[10:53:32] <jessedesu2> Missiles have chaff and decoy warheads
[10:53:38] <Mellowlink> so girls. shall we rename anime to pol now?
[10:53:47] <ButterNoodle> stopping ICBMs is not something that has been tested

[10:53:58] <ButterNoodle> u go to #pol for anime
[10:53:59] <Mellowlink> but it seems like it

[10:54:38] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: yes

[14:58:28] <Bco1981_2> HubertFarnsworth, sore from friday. but otherwise feeling well. but tired.
[14:59:37] <amigojapan> I am also sore form going to say goodbye to the staff that took care of our son
[15:00:10] <amigojapan> I am not used to going such a long distance anymore, and my back is not in good condition
[15:02:36] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth:I read it more carefully, and the lickable TV has a transparent sheet that goes over the TV, which automatically replaces the old sheet after every time you lick it. so I guess it is not as direty as I imagined
[15:05:18] <HubertFarnsworth> ouch Bco1981_2 
[15:05:35] <HubertFarnsworth> nice amigojapan 
[15:06:42] <HubertFarnsworth> it would be better if it produced a small soluble paper like thing instead of directly licking amigojapan 
[15:07:56] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: yeah, I guess the inventor was very keen on having it be a TV, he could have just sprayed the ingredients onto a sheet which you pick up and lick withought the TV part

[19:36:40] <Omega037> I fapped in my wife last night
[19:36:45] <Omega037> Which gives me mixed feelings
[19:37:19] <Omega037> Like she didn't mind but she also wasn't into it at all
[19:37:39] <MootPoot> from what I hear , it happens
[19:37:44] <Smeef> Sounds like a problem
[19:37:49] <MootPoot> just be happy she likes you enough to let it  happen
[19:38:01] <MootPoot> idk maybe do it again today but just focus on her
[19:38:29] <Omega037> Eh, it had been a while, so she was being nice
[19:38:40] <Omega037> And needed to take a shower anyways, which is usually her objection
[19:39:03] <MootPoot> idk
[19:39:07] <MootPoot> not that  I have a gf or a wife
[19:39:15] <MootPoot> but I'd do something for her today in exchange
[19:39:24] <Omega037> I'm always happy and willing to help her out, but she has a lower libido than mine
[19:39:58] <Omega037> Eh, we aren't that transactional
[19:40:14] <Omega037> I do nice things for my wife all the time because I try to make her happy when I can
[19:40:16] <Smeef> Maybe up the foreplay game, like make it last hours
[19:40:17] <MootPoot> even if its not transationcal - brownie points for later
[19:40:19] <MootPoot> idk
[19:40:28] <MootPoot> lmao ##anime is trying to give romantic advice
[19:40:30] <MootPoot> looooool
[19:40:35] <Omega037> Smeef, I think too much foreplay was the issue last night, though really it was that she was tired
[19:40:42] <Smeef> Ah
[19:40:45] <MootPoot> we're all virgin-kuns anyway
[19:40:47] <Omega037> Which is pretty common, we have 3 young kids who don't sleep great
[19:40:58] <Omega037> There are other non-virgins here
[19:41:01] <Smeef> That explains it, say no more, lol
[19:41:10] <MootPoot> rip
[19:42:19] <Omega037> Anyways, it is just a weird feeling
[19:42:36] <Omega037> Like it was 100% consensual, but it was also 100% objectifying
[19:42:38] <MootPoot> we're all virgin-kuns in mindset
[19:42:50] <MootPoot> jk
[19:43:07] <Omega037> If you replaced her with a Real Doll that felt and looked the same, it would have made no difference
[19:43:39] <Omega037> Though I suppose there was pressure to finish quickly, which makes it worse
[19:43:44] <MootPoot> tbh just go tell her all of these things
[19:43:49] <MootPoot> see what she says
[19:43:52] <MootPoot> not that I know much
[19:44:08] <Omega037> I mean, this isn't the first time
[19:44:23] <MootPoot> well, sounds like you have it already handled then
[19:44:24] <Omega037> We've had sex probably 1000 times
[19:44:46] <Omega037> Well, maybe not 1000 but more than 500
[19:44:56] <Smeef> Pitfalls of married life with kids
[19:45:10] <Omega037> Well, also just mismatched libidos
[19:45:24] <MootPoot> afaik most marriages have mismatched libidos
[19:45:26] <pokhu> how old is she
[19:45:27] <MootPoot> you just deal with it
[19:45:37] <Omega037> It isn't horrible, but I would probably be daily and she would prefer once a week
[19:45:49] <Omega037> We are both 38
[19:46:06] <Omega037> I'm getting snipped next month, so there will be a break period for a while
[19:47:27] <pokhu> dont really see any solution to the problem, if you could call it a problem
[19:47:33] <Omega037> It isn't a problem
[19:47:44] <Omega037> It just gives me mixed feelings
[19:47:50] <pokhu> eventually youll lose your libido too and you can spend your time peacefully in retirement
[19:48:16] <pokhu> what mixed feelings
[19:48:18] <pokhu> exactly
[19:48:34] <Omega037> Basically using her as a fleshlight
[19:48:38] <Omega037> Gives me mixed feelings
[19:48:53] <Omega037> I didn't do anything immoral or hurt her or anything
[19:49:22] <Omega037> But there is some guilt

[21:03:01] <isekaijin> lol
[21:04:26] <isekaijin> Sadale: Why would you want to degrade anime art by posting it in a venue for furries?

[21:08:47] <isekaijin> Well, ‚Äúfurry‚Äù refers to a specific aesthetic. I don't think typical anime-style kemonomimi characters (which are mostly human-looking, and in particular, don't have animal mouths or noses) count as ‚Äúfurries‚Äù.
[21:09:43] <isekaijin> A recurring joke with anime-style kemonomimi characters is that they have four ears, because the design is so human that the artist forgets to remove the human ears.
[21:10:29] <darkwitch> looking back the previous discussions I guess there are many virgins with kids and family too
[21:11:58] <isekaijin> Do you mean, like, someone who has had a child in the past, but is a ‚Äúhonorary virgin‚Äù because of their current lifestyle?
[21:12:32] <darkwitch> who knows. words can mean anything these days
[21:14:36] <darkwitch> it's not that the artist forgets to remove the human ears but simply that they added anime ears to make it look cute
[21:17:09] <darkwitch> oops, added animal ears, not anime ears
[21:17:23] <DunceCotus> animal ears are cuter than human ones
[21:17:29] <pokhu> cats with human ears

[23:36:52] <MootPoot> OH GOD
[23:36:56] <MootPoot> IT EXISTS
[23:36:57] <emmeka> it's real.
[23:37:29] <emmeka> nominally it's designed for like touchscreen all in one PCs and shit
[23:38:03] <emmeka> MootPoot but anyway, betamax case, ripping for the purpose of timeshifting is explicitly legal and always has been.
[23:38:17] <emmeka> for the same reason PVRs are legal
[23:39:02] <emmeka> same reason you can legally rip a Bluray to keep the files on your own PC
[23:39:45] <emmeka> MootPoot so if downloading is an explicit requirement for you (which is fair) you can still watch anime legally.
[23:41:07] <HeTo> emmeka: I don't know about Canada in particular but I think copyright conventions require countries to make it illegal to break effective technological measures. usually countries make it illegal even if your purpose for breaking those measures is making an otherwise legal copy
[23:41:57] <HeTo> now I don't know if Crunchyroll has employed effective technological measures or not
[23:48:17] <emmeka> it is illegal to break DRM, yes, but this isn't necessary for streaming services
[23:49:03] <emmeka> you can basically rip things the old-fashioned way, ie by recording it as it plays, and there are many services that can do this in the background

[23:52:10] <Smeef> I just installed Windows Subsystem for Android on my W11 laptop, it's garbage
[23:52:12] <MootPoot> What if I pay crunchy... Then I just download it elsewhere 
[23:52:22] <MootPoot> Smeef: subsystem for android?? 
[23:52:30] <MootPoot> Oh, the emulation Thing 
[23:52:42] <Smeef> Virtualized
