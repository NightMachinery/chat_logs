[16:06:06] <klm> jcroisant: I'm excited to see how Jiffi turns out. Best of luck!
[16:13:46] <klm> What's the best way to suggest changes to the manual?
[16:14:12] <klm> Just "save" and have someone review and possibly revert?
[16:37:26] <sjamaan> Sure
[16:42:39] <sjamaan> mario-goulart: It might not need to be a new major release.  We want to add a runtime option to disable strict checks (possibly it's disabled by default initially)
[16:43:05] <sjamaan> mario-goulart: That would allow us to introduce the change transparently, then run the Salmonella tests with this runtime option enabled and see what breaks

[16:57:56] <klm> sorry about the wiki spam. please have a look at http://wiki.call-cc.org/man/5/Cross%20development to see if my changes are adequate. btw: static linking on Windows is a super feature! I can do everything I need to produce a standalone .exe-file on my linux development machine.
[16:58:11] <sjamaan> Neat!
[16:59:09] <klm> my windows 10 qemu guest will happily run that hello.exe. I also got nrepl to work after clicking on the Windows firewall warning, so now things can get interactive too. really nice! :-)

[20:51:05] <vandusen> [eggs repo (r41037, by kristianlm)] tweak mingw cross compile example
[20:54:56] <johnjaye> Zipheir: i was looking at a few category theory books as well
[20:55:00] <johnjaye> maybe i got confused lol
[20:56:20] <Zipheir> johnjaye: Aha.
[21:04:43] <johnjaye> i think i need some way to save links over my LAN so i can load them on my laptop
[21:04:56] <johnjaye> i think it was triples, toposes, and categories?
[21:05:01] <johnjaye> by Barr and Wells.
[21:05:21] <vandusen> [eggs repo (r41038, by kristianlm)] tweak mingw cross compiling example (again, sorry...)
[21:06:31] <Zipheir> johnjaye: Looks good.
[21:07:02] <johnjaye> also i wanted to ask you. does mit gnu scheme define the 'bundle' keyword?
[21:07:31] <johnjaye> or is that something that sussman and hanson introduce later? it's not in r7rs
[21:07:31] <Zipheir> I don't know much of anything about MIT/GNU Scheme.
[21:07:40] <Zipheir> That sounds very Sussman.
[21:07:49] <johnjaye> there was an 'intro to scheme' appendix and i knew everything except the record type and that
[21:07:53] <johnjaye> ah ok. yeah that was my guess
[21:08:58] <Zipheir> johnjaye: My PDfF's index says 396 for `bundle`.
[21:09:12] <Zipheir> (But it's also lacking page numbers, so that's not very helpful)
[21:12:56] *** Quits: xaltsc (~xaltsc@user/xaltsc) (Remote host closed the connection)
[21:15:11] <johnjaye> yeah that's the appendix where he mentions make-bundle-predicate
[21:16:21] <johnjaye> would be funny if that was just part forgot to take out
