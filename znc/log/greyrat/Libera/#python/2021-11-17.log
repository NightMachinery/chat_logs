[02:49:03] <SnoopJ> mefistofeles, and it will only do that skip if a RuntimeError occurs that contains the string I'm checking for. Any C++ exception gets mapped to it, so I have to check to be sure it's not some other failure

[05:36:20] *** Joins: Andrynet (~Andrynet@186.46.207.121)
[05:37:10] <SnoopJ> stewie925, does it run with the system site, or in a venv when you do that?
[05:37:16] <jinsun> johnkeats6: and you got it wrong, there is no difference between assgnment to mutable vs immutable value, both will change only the name you assign to and nothing else
[05:37:28] *** Quits: SpeakerToMeat__ (~Speaker@user/speakertomeat) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[05:37:39] <SnoopJ> Just because it works for "run" doesn't mean it will necessarily work for "debug," those are different things the IDE is invoking for you, and they're generally separately configurable

[05:44:24] <nedbat> johnkeats6: your assignment propagates outside because it's a mutation of a value passed in
[05:44:46] <jinsun> johnkeats6: you can mutate mutable things in a way that affects all names that point to it (like assigning to an item inside a DataFrame like you did), but simply assigning a new df to x like x  = new_df will not do that

[05:45:52] <nedbat> johnkeats6: take a look at https://bit.ly/pynames1
[05:45:58] <johnkeats6> it's similar to how if you pass a list in, list.append will propage outside, but list = new_list doesn't
[05:46:03] *** Joins: sharperguy (~sharpergu@89.244.120.191)
[05:46:43] <johnkeats6> so i suppose the idea is: an assigment always creates a new reference, but mutable types may have methods which alter their values

[05:51:21] <nedbat> johnkeats6: it makes a new object:  `x[1] + 1`.  then it puts a reference to that object at x[0]

[05:51:56] *** Joins: nrg (~NRG@user/nrg)
[05:52:54] <johnkeats6> nedbat, but why does that alter what the reference is outside?
[05:53:02] <SnoopJ> stewie925, I can't really help with the materials, but I could possibly help with the problem. So far, my attempts haven't gone well, but I still have the same question: Does the regular run use the system Python, or a venv?
[05:53:07] <nedbat> johnkeats6: because x is never re-assigned
[05:53:27] <Pi-sistance> jinsun onee of the elements is zero. I fed it into a function with a denominator with the input argument. I typed if x=0 etc. it wont let me set an if value for the one specific time the element is zero though
[05:53:28] <nedbat> johnkeats6: `x[0] = y` is actually:  `x.__setitem__(0, y)`
[05:53:45] <stewie925> SnoopJ, the regular 'flask run" uses the env
[05:53:50] <SnoopJ> yea, not only is it syntactic sugar, it comes in both chocolate and vanilla :)

[05:54:12] <stewie925> venv  I mean

[05:54:27] <stewie925> cause I only install flask in the venv
[05:54:42] <SnoopJ> stewie925, well, the debug invocation is not, it says pretty directly there that it's using /usr/bin/python3, i.e. the system Python. That is likely why it can't find your application: it's not in the system site, it's in the venv.
[05:54:53] <SnoopJ> So fixing that is probably your path to victory :)
[05:55:00] *** Quits: Andrynet (~Andrynet@186.46.207.121) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[05:55:16] <jinsun> Pi-sistance: if x=0 is invalid syntax, did you mean if x==0
[05:55:37] <SnoopJ> (thank goodness)
[05:55:48] <Pi-sistance> yes, it wont let me do an if statement for just the one element that is zero
[05:55:51] <johnkeats6> nedbat, so maybe i imagine that x holds references to each value in the dataframe. x itself is mutable, so when i use its setitem method i really change what the reference is. but i'm referring to a new thing
[05:56:10] <nedbat> johnkeats6: you are changing the reference at x[0], yes.
[05:56:36] <stewie925> SnoopJ thanks for your patience in explaining - yes I need to figure out how to get the venv activated automatically
[05:56:41] <johnkeats6> so the old x[0] would exist for a while until garbage collector yadda yadda
[05:57:03] <SnoopJ> stewie925, why do you need to activate it? It should be enough to just replace `/usr/bin/python3` in that launch with `/path/to/venv/bin/python3` and it should Just Work from there, I think
[05:57:40] <nedbat> johnkeats6: the details of the garbage collection don't really matter, but: if there are no more references to the old x[0], the value will be reclaimed immediately.
[05:57:40] <johnkeats6> more importantly: if i re-assign the whole variable passed in, there is no circumstance in which that would propagate outside. correct?
[05:58:04] <nedbat> johnkeats6: a straight assignment in the function `x = ...` will not propagate outside.

[05:58:48] <SnoopJ> johnkeats6, references themselves in CPython are PyObject*. They aren't garbage collected as far as I know, the memory for the pointers just has the lifetime that C's semantics defines.
[05:59:17] <SnoopJ> *Objects* themselves will live until they're garbage collected, and are the thing you see from the Python programmer's seat

[06:03:32] <SnoopJ> stewie925, getting VSCode to properly track venvs has tripped me up a few times, but when it's misbehaving I've often been able to cajole it back into functionality by pointing at the venv using the command palette. Once it's in the project's workspace settings, it's relatively static after that, in my experience.

[06:09:16] <stewie925> no, my app is not in the venv environment
[06:09:41] <SnoopJ> `import foo` means "Hey Python, go look in the places you know about in a fixed order and see if you can find a thing named 'foo'" so when something goes wrong, it usually means the "list of places" isn't what you think it is

[06:25:21] <SnoopJ> stewie925, `FLASK_APP=app.py` seems kinda weird, as I look at it. This environment variable tells Flask how to find the thing it should import the application, but I don't think `app.py` is quite right? Someone who knows the Flask/VSCode intersection a little better than I do might have a comment about that, but I would try `app` there if your application is defined in a file named app.py
[06:25:37] <SnoopJ> The VSCode docs do make it seem like it's app.py but I can't find anything like that in the Flask docs, and don't recall doing it that way before...
[06:25:53] <SnoopJ> but maybe it just knows about .py as a suffix
[06:25:55] <stewie925> well, my program is coincidentally named app.py as well
[06:26:02] <esv> hey folks, I am trying to use unittest module to write test cases for a script that imports 10 modules and would like to avoid to code one test method for each import statement, is it possible?

[07:02:38] <Guest253> Hello I am trying to figure out how I can make API requests on https://testnet.demo.btcpayserver.org using their API https://docs.btcpayserver.org/API/Greenfield/v1/#section/Authentication/Basic
[07:03:13] <Guest253> I came across https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18139093/base64-authentication-python but not sure what to do. Using python 3.
[07:04:12] <johnkeats6> so tell me if i'm right: i can think of a list as an object that for each element holds a reference to its value. when i do a = [x] * 8 i'm making a list of 8 elements all referring to whatever value x refers to. when i do a[0] = 1 i'm secretly using the list's __setitem__ method which changes what the 0th element refers to. it won't change what the other elements refer to. when i do a = [[0,1]] * 2, i create a list with 2
[07:04:12] <johnkeats6> elements both of which refer to the same [0,1]. when i do a[0][0] = 1, i'm using the __setitem__ method of a[0], which is the unique [0,1] object i just mentioned. this mutates that object, and both a[0] and a[1] refer to it
[07:05:08] <johnkeats6> so it ends up changing both a[0][0] and a[1][0]

[07:08:26] <SnoopJ> Python itself does not have references, except that names are used to refer to objects. But this isn't a "reference" in the same sense as a pointer, it's just a string that may be associated with an object at runtime (and if it isn't, that's a NameError)

Even if this is a guarantee CPython makes (which it _very_ much doesn't), this will very likely change in the future (like when the GIL goes away), and it's very much not the case in other Python implementations.

[16:30:53] <MacGyver> But you run into issues with device exclusivity / mixing.
[16:31:03] <pwillard> basically, I'm using a raspberry pi zero to make an alarm clock... so the goal is to play an Mp3 file at "alarm time"   It all works interactively... but I wanted the script to start at boot time so added it to cron.  I'm thinking I might need an alterative startup approach.
[16:31:46] <Swayze> linux has startup scripts/mechanisms
[16:31:59] <Swayze> like init.d
[16:32:15] <pwillard> It also works via cron... bit it is ignoring the pygame mixer settings... and therefore plays at a much different volume.

[16:33:25] <lidless> Oh nm
[16:33:48] <lidless> It gets weird unless it’s a service

[16:35:21] <Yhg1s> pwillard: the thing you're using to cahnge the volume settings requires information that cron doesn't provide. You have to provide that information for the program to work.

[17:36:22] <Guest253> Hello I am trying to figure out how to create a Store in btcpayserver API. https://dpaste.org/LOpo
[17:36:41] <grym> irssi has `oopsie.pl` as a plugin, which prevents such things
[17:36:55] <Guest253> I have an API key but am not using it in the code if that is the reason idk how to implement it
[17:37:24] <thevishy> good to know! it checks for these kind of things which nice :)

[18:56:35] <peac> hey, i need to create a docker image where two programs using different versions of python are executed. I know it's not the way containers should be used but they need to share a unix socket and have other constraints that let me with this as the best option. I'm creating a multistage image that first installs the first app, then the second, and lastly brings everything in the release container.
[18:56:38] *** Joins: johnjay (~pi@192.142.100.50)
[18:56:43] <peac> I'm using virtualenv to keep the dependencies together with each program, but afaiu virtualenv will not package python itself in its directory. Then there's pyenv which is there to install the right python version, but has a bunch of dependencies that are unwanted in the final image. How should I approach this ?

[19:03:37] <haps> Hi, a small question to help clarify my understanding, I'm not _really_ interested in the performance impact at all, but I think 'if a<b: a = b' is likely faster than 'a = max(a,b)' because in the second statement there's always an assignment (which I assume to be slower than a branch)?  Or am I mistaken?
[19:03:55] <grym> there's an assignment in your first statement too
[19:04:03] <deniska> haps: there's only one way to know for sure
[19:04:12] <deniska> haps: but likely it hardly matters in a real program
[19:04:17] <haps> grym: but only if the if evaluates to true.
[19:04:40] <grym> haps: i suppose, yeah
[19:04:48] <raxor2k> bjs / graingert[m](no idea why you use that [m] btw):  is there any reason why an sql alchemy crud function makes the other asyncio task "hang" ?
[19:04:52] <raxor2k> i found out this is the reason
[19:05:00] <peac> grym: debian:bullseye-slim would be perfectly suitable for my last image

[19:08:24] <Swayze> let  us know the results :p

[22:17:25] <bparker> why does one construct merely being different from another make it unwise to use? wouldn't that apply to basically all language features?

[23:44:09] <TuckerBrandy199> Im having trouble connecting to my database on mongodb using aws python
[23:44:11] <matsaman> okay, then since .trunc is stated to be for truncation, and .fix is stated to be for rounding, I think probably they are not in error
[23:44:27] <TuckerBrandy199> anyone advice?
[23:44:28] <matsaman> might be interesting to compare .fix and .round (if there is one)
[23:45:00] <QuaternionsRock> It is most certainly an error
[23:45:00] <matsaman> TuckerBrandy199: that's a pretty complicated set of things you're dealing with. What are you trying? What errors are you getting?

[23:45:36] <QuaternionsRock> There are large numbers where fix(<a large number>.9) == <a large number> + 1

[23:46:12] <QuaternionsRock> But trunc(<that same number>.9) == <that same number>
[23:46:33] <QuaternionsRock> meaning that trunc is more efficient, more precise, and otherwise defined to produce identical results
[23:46:48] <matsaman> 100.9 rounded up isn't equal to 100 + 1 ?
[23:47:05] <matsaman> efficiency isn't the issue
[23:47:09] <QuaternionsRock> ???
[23:47:28] <matsaman> either you want to truncate, which is _discarding_ information outright, or you want to round, which is _altering_ information to be less precise
[23:47:35] <QuaternionsRock> If fix is supposed to round towards 0, why should it round a positive number *up*?
[23:48:10] <matsaman> the question of rounding up or down, if you aren't explicitly doing one or the other already, will not even come up with a number ending in .9
[23:48:13] <matsaman> you would round up

[23:49:57] <QuaternionsRock> sco1 it only uses the result of ceil for negative numbers
