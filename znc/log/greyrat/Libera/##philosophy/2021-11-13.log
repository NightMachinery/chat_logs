[12:11:11] * arryana pushes a tea to pussipupu
[12:11:54] * pussipupu me slides arryana a bowl of porridge
[12:12:00] <arryana> oh, you rock
[12:12:02] * pussipupu me can't type at all today
[12:12:13] <arryana> we tried our guests on marmite
[12:12:20] <arryana> one hell no and one hell yes.
[12:12:31] <pussipupu> I make it with apple juice, add enough brown sugar to take the edge off the acidity, and then cinnamon
[12:12:38] <arryana> oooh
[12:12:48] <arryana> i may steal that, if you don't mind
[12:13:10] <pussipupu> not at all
[12:13:33] <pussipupu> It's not as healthy as an unsugared breakfast, but it is more like eating liquid fresh apple doughnuts...
[12:13:47] <pussipupu> Don't try doing it with cider though, it's disgusting and a waste of cider
[12:13:48] <arryana> it sounds delicious
[12:14:02] <arryana> i tend to use maple, molasses, or golden syrup
[12:16:20] <arryana> we don't generally keep cider here
[12:16:23] <arryana> but good to know
[12:16:49] <arryana> we do have at least two containers of cloudy apple juice, and several boxes of shelf stable apple juice
[12:17:17] <pussipupu> The American “cider” is that just unfiltered apple juice?
[12:17:22] <pussipupu> I know “hard cider” is cider
[12:17:32] <arryana> i was thinking in uk terms
[12:17:47] <pussipupu> Yeah, this is an aside because you probably know :)
[12:17:58] * arryana nods
[12:18:07] <arryana> i'd make a clarity joke, but that ties back to apples...
[12:18:41] <arryana> i admit, we took the plague seriously, and brexit is certainly messing with availability of things
[12:18:52] <arryana> we have significant stocks of shelf stable stuff
[12:19:31] <arryana> we could use another few boxes of cereal, a case each of orange and apple juice, and maybe another gallon of olive oil
[12:19:34] <arryana> but mostly we're sorted
[12:20:17] <arryana> the next thing to collect is tools.
[12:20:20] <pussipupu> Prepping is good
[12:20:37] <arryana> ideally i'd love to have a chest freezer in the garage
[12:20:45] <pussipupu> It's just the people who prep by collecting only weaponry and fascism that give it a bad name
[12:20:49] <arryana> oy
[12:20:56] <arryana> i have enough weaponry here
[12:21:23] <arryana> if someone managed to get past the dogs (good luck) i keep two wrist rockets.
[12:21:46] <arryana> one can either be loaded with plastic shot or metal, and the other is set up with a whisker biscuit and arrows.
[12:22:05] <pussipupu> I don't think anything in this house would be generally considered primarily a weapon
[12:22:17] <arryana> i'm more than confident in that defensive capability
[12:22:35] <arryana> we're also going to be putting in two secret doors, at some point

[12:23:15] <ro-bot-o> [url] Pantry Door– Murphy Door, Inc. | murphydoor.com
[12:23:22] <arryana> tell me that isn't totally awesome
[12:24:05] <arryana> that would completely disguise my dining room.  and there'd be another of some sort which would vanish the back half of the house
[12:25:05] <arryana> keeping zombies confused is half the battle
[12:26:20] <pussipupu> That's pretty cute indeed
[12:26:48] <pussipupu> I'm thinking of building some bookshelf doors in the study, that open to present a dressing room/wardrobe
[12:26:59] <pussipupu> But I've done a quick pricing up of the parts and meep
[12:28:48] <arryana> yeah
[12:29:02] <arryana> well, we're gonna be here a while, it isn't a today project
[12:29:16] <pussipupu> Same, and it's not near the top of the list even
[12:29:17] <arryana> it's the sort of thing i rope my little hacker into helping me install
[12:29:33] <arryana> while he was here we got the screen up in the lounge
[12:29:34] <pussipupu> IT would come after the primary decorations of that room, which are after most of the house for one thing
[12:29:48] <arryana> we're not tv people. so we use a projector and screen
[12:30:00] <pussipupu> Ugh, now you reminded me I need to pry a tile off the living room ceiling
[12:30:06] <arryana> sorry
[12:30:19] <pussipupu> We want a projector setup, and I want it to be hidden in the ceiling when it's turned off
[12:30:25] <arryana> we have two
[12:30:27] <pussipupu> I kid, it's just a long todo list :)
[12:30:33] <arryana> one in the master bedroom and one in the lounge
[12:30:36] <arryana> haha
[12:31:06] <arryana> the potential guest rooms have conventional tvs
[12:31:59] <arryana> we keep getting given tvs, even though we don't watch the things
[12:32:02] <arryana> i have no idea what that is
[12:32:51] <arryana> better than 80% of what goes on the screens is for the dogs, so it's usually steam trains
[12:33:42] <pussipupu> We do watch TV, but we'd rather it wasn't there when we weren't looking at it
[12:33:52] * arryana nods
[12:33:59] <pussipupu> We can use the space for books and my uplifited antique radio project

[12:35:33] <pussipupu> In my defence it was already dead before I started defiling it
[12:35:42] <arryana> which has turned out to be of larger scope than i expected
[12:35:45] <arryana> haha
[12:36:34] <arryana> i'm also seriously considering adding structural parts
[12:37:45] <arryana> it isn't that they're needed, but it would make it so i can install it piece by piece alone
[12:38:00] <arryana> otherwise my other half will be helping at me.
[12:39:09] <arryana> he has a wonderfully communal and helpful mind, so his first response to such things is to make five suggestions on how we could be doing it differently.
[12:39:47] <arryana> which is very sweet, and amazingly creative.  but i already have a plan and just want to put it into motion without explaining or discussing it.
[12:41:29] <pussipupu> I really wish we had a hackerspace I could actually get to, some skill exchange would be nice

[13:05:49] <causative> the basic problem in society is:  the assholes are in charge.  Why are they in charge?  Because they're willing to lie and cheat, to cut away any moral impulse that might hold them back from power, and to collude via the good-old-boys network.
[13:06:32] <causative> And because the asshole-filters - the social institutions that ought to prevent power-seeking assholes from gaining power - are not working properly, which is by design by the assholes who are in charge.
[13:08:16] <causative> The only possible solution is to build better asshole-filters - build social institutions that can more reliably tell apart who has genuinely done good, who is genuinely on the side of truth, and who is only a bad-faith power-seeker
[13:10:01] <causative> The key to a good asshole-filter is accountability.  Do something bad?  Face the consequences.  Do something good?  Get rewarded.  The challenge lies in how to determine which acts are good and which are bad, in the face of assholes trying to corrupt the process at every step.
[13:11:42] <pussipupu> Adding layers and parallisation to both civil society and formal democracy is part of the filter
[13:15:01] <causative> if by that you mean, multiple competing groups who have a strong and real interest in seeing the crimes of the other groups get exposed, then yes
[13:16:39] <causative> free and fair elections are a prerequisite for this.  Proportionate representation, or ranked choice voting, help increase the number of such groups compared to first-past-the-post.

[14:43:14] <Ungwelian> Insectoids are a good idea, just because of the rarity.
[14:43:46] <Ungwelian> Aasimar paladin must be one of the biggest clichés nowadays.
[14:43:54] <pussipupu> There's at least one playable insectoid race in D&D, the Thri-kreen, but they aren't flyers and despite backstory don't /play/ like eusocials
[14:44:18] <Ungwelian> I once thought of making elves eusocial.
[14:44:23] <pussipupu> This game won't be a D&D one though, it'll be a system you've never played
[14:44:33] <Ungwelian> All elves are in constant telepathic communication with the Elf Queen.
[14:44:38] <pussipupu> Not impossible in mammals, q.v. naked mole rats
[14:44:49] <pussipupu> I assume your elves are mammalian, at least broadly
[14:45:00] <Ungwelian> Yeah, long ago.
[14:45:44] <Ungwelian> Nowadays I'd like to play scifi or fantasy with the weirdest combinations :)
[14:47:10] <pussipupu> Currently all I play is D&D 5e, which I find pretty unsatisfactory, partly because the default D&D meta-setting is so cliche
[14:47:24] <pussipupu> The way to fix this is of course to GM a game, so that's my plan :)
[14:47:35] <Ungwelian> I used to GM 2nd edition.
[14:47:56] <Ungwelian> Hated when they dropped the multiclassing in 3rd.
[14:48:06] *** Quits: loopdreams (~user@51.37.203.118) (Quit: ERC 5.3 (IRC client for GNU Emacs 29.0.50))
[14:48:15] <Ungwelian> Seemed like characters were promoted to become cherry-picked "builds".
[14:48:35] <Ungwelian> "Take one level of monk for the wisdom bonus to AC."
[14:49:21] <Ungwelian> In the old editions, leveling up meant training under a master, and it could take quite a lot of time.
[14:49:21] <pussipupu> I find the 3rd ed multiclassing to be the sweet spot personally
[14:50:08] <Ungwelian> One of the problems with D&D has always been, that you level up by killing monsters.
[14:50:13] <Ungwelian> They're the main source of exp.
[14:50:18] <pussipupu> “sweet spot” in the context of D&D systems I've played, the sweet spot in general is “character classes are a silly idea”
[14:50:27] <Ungwelian> RPing exp is utterly peanuts compared to murder.
[14:50:41] <pussipupu> Yeah, though that's dependant on the GM
[14:50:46] <Ungwelian> Yep.
[14:50:54] <Ungwelian> I changed it so that players don't count XP at all.
[14:51:02] <Ungwelian> Instead, everyone levels up at the same time when I say so.
[14:51:04] <pussipupu> (Well, everything is dependant on the GM, on account of them being the supergod)
[14:51:39] <pussipupu> I tend to assign points for a given problem I'm throwing at people, with bonuses for things like avoiding bloodshed
[14:52:05] <Ungwelian> Yeah, that's already much better than just kill XP.
[14:52:29] <mnemon> quest XP is often the main source anyways
[14:52:47] <Ungwelian> The concept barely exists in 2nd ed. AD&D :P
[14:53:14] <mnemon> also less hassle than counting how many goblin scalps everyone managed to get :o
[14:53:32] <Ungwelian> Another funny thing was the alignments.
[14:53:44] <Ungwelian> So many times, a paladin was Lawful Stupid.
[14:53:53] <pussipupu> Alignments are also a silly idea
[14:54:09] <pussipupu> Paladins are fash with delusions of ethics, for the most part
[14:54:27] <Ungwelian> I think paladins are usually played wrong.
[14:54:35] <mnemon> it's kind of neat idea combined with the outer planes
[14:54:38] <pussipupu> The CG paladin analogue from 3e is better, but I forget the name now
[14:55:03] <Ungwelian> The rolemodel for a paladin is an arthurian knight, with allegiance to both kingdom and God.
[14:55:13] <Ungwelian> And romantic knightly virtues.
[14:55:53] <Ungwelian> People play them like "the warrior who gets plusses to saving throws".
[14:55:53] <pussipupu> They end up more like crusaders generally
[14:55:54] <mnemon> rolemodel for anything lawful is allegiance to both kingdom and god(usually)
[14:56:05] <pussipupu> With allegiance to the  king and the pope, who are often conveniently the same person

[14:59:53] <Ungwelian> I find it a sad how the modern paladin is sometimes turned into a fanatic.
[14:59:56] <pussipupu> It's a vicious circle of worlds suiting martial characters who are playing them and characters suiting martial worlds
[15:00:14] <testusr> Ungwelian : like assange?
[15:00:44] <Ungwelian> testusr, like in Pillars of Eternity.
[15:01:00] <pussipupu> Fanatic is good as a failure mode of paladin, but it's treated as if it's the same thing which is why I get sick of them
[15:01:15] <Ungwelian> Yeah.
[15:01:38] <pussipupu> The Goblins comic had a good example of a Paladin turned fash

[15:07:33] <pussipupu> One of the things real people and fictional people do is fighting, so it makes sense to have rules for that, but it's a shame it dominates so many games

[15:08:17] <mnemon> and for political intrigue you don't really need the same kind of system you need for combat activities
[15:08:43] <Ungwelian> A lot is up to the DM. For example, you can present a feudal society very well to the players.
[15:08:53] <Ungwelian> And it can be a lot of fun to live various roles in that.
[15:09:27] <mnemon> yes, but for combat to be engaging you need the system, if you want to do other things you can, just ignore the combat bits
[15:10:02] <mnemon> the worldbuilding is quite central to most of the games and it's entirely unnecessary for the combat simulator bit
[15:10:26] <mnemon> (although it does create justifications for the character possibilities)
[15:10:55] <Ungwelian> It'd be interesting if you could have for example philosophical feats.
[15:12:05] <mnemon> I suppose there could be more depth to the skill/knowledge system but not sure how "philosophical feats" would function?

[18:52:52] <tomathy> like a foreinger
[18:53:07] <p0indexter> that is the limited use im refering to
[18:53:26] <tomathy> ok
[18:53:27] <tomathy> misread
[18:53:35] <p0indexter> its ok to educate
[18:54:27] <tomathy> i often feel like calling white people niggers though
[18:55:03] <Ungwelian> From a religious standpoint, swear words tend to be the opposite of sacrality.
[18:55:06] <Ungwelian> Profanity.
[18:55:13] <p0indexter> soo tomathy....do you use the word often?
[18:55:28] <Ungwelian> Having to do with profane matter, espcially bodily fluids and such.
[18:55:29] <tomathy> p0indexter: i think it almost all the time
[18:55:57] <tomathy> i like it as a word of contempt, like Raca, or stupid, or bitch
[18:55:57] <Ungwelian> And the body parts which secrete bodily fluids or actions like such.
[18:56:05] <p0indexter> sooo you use it towards african americans mostly
[18:56:17] <tomathy> i have never even met an african american
[18:56:30] <Ungwelian> Shit, fuck, cunt, asshole, so on.
[18:56:54] <tomathy> shmuck is a good one
[18:56:58] <Ungwelian> Basically, swearing is a cartesian statement.
[18:56:58] <tomathy> fucking shmuck

[19:00:34] <tomathy> yes you are proving that as we speak p0indexter
[19:03:12] <p0indexter> sooo if you think it all the time there is a high probability you say it at least as often and if that werent enough you need to say it online aswell
[19:04:50] <p0indexter> after all you desperately needed to discuss it
[19:04:54] <tomathy> not that often really only if there's a humourous context

[19:14:55] <p0indexter> reclaim it
[19:15:17] <p0indexter> tomathy how old are you
[19:15:53] <tomathy> that's not the context i hope to use it
[19:16:12] <tomathy> it isn't about blackness, it's about contempt
[19:16:22] <tomathy> that's the abstraction of the word
[19:16:27] <p0indexter> but why are you preoccupied w the word

[19:16:57] <p0indexter> it empowers you

[19:17:21] <p0indexter> i see
[19:17:59] <tomathy> the wrong side of it ofc, but that's why it needs reclaiming. it is mere uncoloured contempt
[19:18:55] <tomathy> and "racist" fulfills every single requirement of how that word used to be used
[19:19:07] <tomathy> perfectly, without excess
[19:19:36] <tomathy> whites have been terrifically outwitted

[21:25:11] <biys> yah... that's part of the broader context of the conversation though.  i'll give you an example.  lets assume that there's a particular action that is completed.  that action is then deemed by the general public to be inherently bad.  lets say that some years down the road is is determined that the result of that incident is actually a net possitive
[21:25:22] <biys> we can't necessarily view things from simply withint he time and space they transpire

[21:26:05] <I_Am_M00t> they actually looks halfway decent

[21:26:17] <biys> this, as a result of death being supposedly inherently bad, is "bad"
[21:26:25] <biys> but the effect it has on the ecosystem on a whole is actually a net possitive
[21:26:40] <I_Am_M00t> wow, very interesting
[21:27:47] <I_Am_M00t> i think the right has a way of creating false arguments for everything
[21:28:09] <biys> "the right"
[21:28:30] <I_Am_M00t> the arguments sound very reasonable when you don't provide context, but in-context they fail
[21:28:55] <biys> i would say regardless which side of the table you sit, it's kind of something like self evident that we do not entirely understand the results of something until many years later
[21:29:20] <I_Am_M00t> like now, biys introduces the idea of long-term benefits to unintuitive situation

[21:29:59] <biys> nothing to me is inherently good or bad
[21:30:01] <biys> it just is
[21:30:09] <biys> it depends from which lens you want to view it
[21:30:23] <I_Am_M00t> but... how is this idea relevant to current events? to rioting, to the rights new hero, Kyle
[21:30:29] <Ungwelian> Wasn't it Nietzschean übermench you believe in, biys?
[21:30:37] <I_Am_M00t> in the next episode we will find out
[21:30:54] <I_Am_M00t> you're not neutral biys , get over yourself
[21:31:04] <I_Am_M00t> you're a conservative
[21:31:08] <biys> Ungwelian: with regards to the value structures that currently exist, i would say that the trad judeo-christian values are dead, as a result of god being dead.
[21:31:42] <biys> which is essentially what Thus Spoke Zarathustra is about
[21:31:52] <biys> "god is dead, we killed him, there's not enough water to wash away the blood"
[21:32:04] <biys> or something along those lines
[21:32:21] <Ungwelian> From what I gathered, your professor gave you bad marks, and you came to complain to about it on IRC and said you're a believer in übermensch and new values.
[21:32:41] <biys> you've now conflated to conversations
[21:32:41] *** Quits: blkshp (~blkshp@about/windows/staff/blkshp) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)

[21:33:13] <I_Am_M00t>  biys? bad marks? who'd have thought
[21:33:21] <I_Am_M00t> i bet it's the professor who is wrong amirite
[21:33:23] <tomathy> God was dead for three days.
[21:33:35] <tomathy> Then was raised by God.
[21:33:53] <biys> the conversation that had initially taken place was that someone can take a position about the most admirable or most appropriate way to live within the world/universe as it trascends time and space
[21:34:25] <biys> the second part was about the professors belief that there is such a methodology that exists at this time that one can adapt that is absolutely correct and will uphold scrutiny as it transcends time and space
[21:34:30] *** Joins: blkshp (~blkshp@about/windows/staff/blkshp)
[21:35:15] <biys> my position is that what's considered "most accurate" with regards to m ethodology for living within the world is fluid
[21:35:23] <biys> and entirely depends on the time and space one is occupying
[21:35:29] <biys> but this is something like...  self evident IMO
[21:36:04] <Ungwelian> Yeah, and your professor thought that for example empathy isn't an arbitrary value.
[21:36:10] <biys> because we can look back at things like pederasty
[21:36:17] <biys> and we can see statues that depict it as being normal
[21:36:24] <biys> where as now days it isn't entirely "normal"
[21:36:41] <I_Am_M00t> social relativism?
[21:36:46] <biys> normal in the context of western modernity anyways
[21:37:20] <tomathy> biys: you're basically doing a strawman argument, "people wuz bad therefore no moralz"
[21:37:32] <biys> not really
[21:37:35] <biys> i'm saying that morality is fluid
[21:37:54] <I_Am_M00t> every time I read a new biys post i give it a chance, and then he ruins it by going into tired rightwing populist issues like "muh statues"
[21:37:55] <tomathy> but the question isn't morals its about how to live
[21:38:18] <biys> tomathy: sure.  the most appropriate way to live!
[21:38:23] <Ungwelian> Just because people have different opinions doesn't mean all of those opinions are correct or incorrect.
[21:38:36] <biys> the most appropriate way to live in the world/universe as it trasncends time and space, none the less
[21:38:36] <I_Am_M00t> i know examples are just examples, but when all examples are rightwing populist ones i tune out
[21:38:38] <Ungwelian> Neither does that opinions can change with time.
[21:38:49] <tomathy> biys: the question of how to live even transcends morality
[21:39:03] <biys> Ungwelian: show me the contract with the universe that outlines that your understanding of how one _ought_ to act within the world is the most accurate
[21:39:31] <biys> tell me any absolute truth you believe will transcend time and space
[21:39:34] <Ungwelian> You want a VCR manual to correct behaviour? :)
[21:40:12] <I_Am_M00t> hehe
[21:40:27] <tomathy> biys: you also haven't seemingly noticed that your professor is arguing for a tautology, since he said his "way of living" can be adapted. it's like saying: suppose i have a tool, and that tool can be changed - therefore that tool can fix anything that can be fixed by a tool
[21:40:42] <I_Am_M00t> 2+2=3
[21:41:32] <biys> tomathy: sure
[21:41:32] <I_Am_M00t> if we define the + operator to mean the sum of two numbers minus 1
[21:41:46] <biys> i'
[21:41:46] <I_Am_M00t> this is what biys is saying
[21:42:13] <biys> i think it's a weird position to take that one has determined the most accurate way to live within the world as it transcends time and space.
[21:42:33] <I_Am_M00t> why biys ?
[21:42:34] <biys> cause if not!  are we to suppose that the German people of WW2 are essentially idiots?  or just evil?
[21:42:50] <tomathy> ww2 is completely irrelevant
[21:43:15] <biys> there's countless examples through history where peopel did suppsoedly terrible things
[21:43:22] <biys> are those peopel just evil or just idiots?

[21:43:42] <biys> it's done, it's over
[21:43:47] <Ungwelian> Pretty much the basis for good behaviour is life and happiness. Traditional virtues are a pretty good standpoint towards that.
[21:43:53] <tomathy> biys: are you mad about a low grade?
[21:43:58] <biys> i didn't get a low grade
[21:43:58] <Ungwelian> Values such as honesty, nonviolence, so on.
[21:43:59] <biys> haha
[21:44:08] <tomathy> you should have if these were your arguments
[21:44:16] <biys> i got a low grade on a single assignment where i apparently "didn't show empathy"

[21:44:35] <tomathy> for whom*?
[21:44:54] <biys> for George Orwell
[21:44:58] <biys> when he shot and killed the elephant
[21:45:38] <Ungwelian> A mature person is someone who has cultivated themself so that he can orient with the world virtuously.
[21:45:58] <biys> this is based on presuppositions about how you believe one ought to act within the world
[21:46:00] <Ungwelian> Damn these English pronouns.
[21:46:02] <biys> it's very christian of you!
[21:46:22] <biys> the indoctrination has worked well with you
[21:46:26] <Ungwelian> Christianity can have good pointers.
[21:46:32] <biys> i never said it couldn't
[21:46:38] <Ungwelian> Why are you waving it away as indoctrination?
[21:47:21] <biys> because you're suggesting it's the defacto most appropriate way to live within the world/universe and it will uphold scrutiny as it trasnscends time and space.  i'm a bit more uncertain about it than you are
[21:47:29] <biys> which is why i asked you to show me the contract
[21:47:35] <I_Am_M00t> so biys , you'd agree that christian values aren't necessarily transcendental?
[21:47:59] <Ungwelian> I'd suggest you learn to live on Earth before you learn to live across time and space.
[21:48:01] <biys> christianity isn't that old
[21:48:15] <I_Am_M00t> so you agree?
[21:48:17] <biys> the ideas held by christianity aren't that old
[21:48:49] <I_Am_M00t> and?
[21:48:51] <biys> you do realize that there were ideas about how to live within the world prior to christianity right?
[21:49:09] <I_Am_M00t> yes
[21:49:16] <Ungwelian> Honesty, for example, being fairly widely accepted as a virtue.
[21:49:30] <biys> to some extent.  it's a romantic idea though
[21:49:30] <Ungwelian> Compassion, also.
[21:49:40] <I_Am_M00t> biys:  so do you agree then?
[21:49:42] <biys> i'd say that regardless our ideas of honesty and how admirable it is... people still lie
[21:49:49] <I_Am_M00t> you're not answering the question
[21:49:51] <Ungwelian> "Satyam eva jayate", the national credo of India.
[21:49:57] <Ungwelian> "Truth alone triumphs"
[21:50:27] <biys> i would say that in this time and space we've gotten many examples of even once considered admirable people who've been caught in some form of lie or another
[21:50:33] <biys> do we then throw the baby out with the bath water?
[21:50:55] <I_Am_M00t> biys, so you agree that christian values aren't necessarily transcendental?
[21:51:21] <I_Am_M00t> why not just say yes or no? a minute ago you were defending this very idea
[21:51:45] <I_Am_M00t> does it not also apply to scripture?
[21:52:14] <I_Am_M00t> you may now continue evading
[21:52:51] <biys> i would say that christian values, much like any of the previous belief systems, are entirely fluid and change with time.
[21:53:12] <biys> to suggest that the christians of today are the same as the christians of 1000 years ago is nonsense
[21:53:50] <Ungwelian> Some more than others.
[21:53:57] <biys> haha
[21:53:58] <Ungwelian> The Ten Commandments, for example, are widely accepted.
[21:54:03] <biys> this isn't me hating on christians btw either
[21:54:23] <biys> i have no problems with christians
[21:54:45] <biys> but lets talk about, for example, the apostolic traditions of Hippolytus
[21:55:52] <I_Am_M00t> biys: do you think either of old or new christian values are transcendental?
[21:55:57] <biys> JBP does suggest that there is some kind of inherent biological function associated with uh...
[21:56:05] <biys> how we are supposed to act in a social setting
[21:56:10] <biys> he uses Jaque Panksepp
[21:56:13] <biys> as his example
[21:57:11] <biys> I_Am_M00t: i think it is both possible and impossible that christian values will transcend time and space.
[21:57:30] <I_Am_M00t> :) nice tactic
[21:57:35] <biys> if but simply on paper
[21:57:37] <biys> or if in the minds of people
[21:58:27] <I_Am_M00t> so basically, if you don't believe in transcendental values, then no version of religious values are transcendental
[21:58:30] <biys> but we have to be careful when we start talking about inherent biological functions
[21:58:57] <I_Am_M00t> but you are resistant to clear answers
[21:59:04] <biys> I_Am_M00t: i cannot predict the future,  i am open to the idea that "christian values" may progress through some time and space
[21:59:08] <I_Am_M00t> everything has to be muddled
[21:59:29] <I_Am_M00t> biys: you're deflecting
[21:59:33] <biys> i am also open to the idea that christian values may die out to some other idea of how one _ought_ to live within the world
[21:59:38] <I_Am_M00t> everything is a word salad
[21:59:48] <biys> which is why i said i align with nietzsche's ubermensch
[21:59:57] <biys> i think that the traditional ideas of righteousness are a tad bit old
[22:00:44] <I_Am_M00t> if you think that values are always fluid, then you cannot posit that some value system is transcendental
[22:00:54] <I_Am_M00t> it's simple logic
[22:00:55] <biys> it does seem as though we're in some kind of paradigm shift at this point.  i'll use the "one ship" analogy
[22:01:07] <biys> we're, all, in this together!  so keep m oving don't stop
[22:01:11] <biys> so keep moving don't stop
[22:01:19] <biys> idk if it's organic in nature
[22:01:25] <biys> or if it's a natural progression
[22:01:57] <I_Am_M00t> biys, if you think that values are always fluid, then you cannot posit that some value system is transcendental
[22:02:22] <biys> i outlined that already.  i said JBP mentions Jaque Panksepp the rat ticklet
[22:02:35] <biys> and suggests that there might be some behaviours that are inherently biological
[22:02:41] <biys> tickler
[22:02:46] <I_Am_M00t> the assumption rules out any transcendental value system biys
[22:02:54] <biys> but we have to b e very careful when we talk about inherent biological functions

[22:08:49] <I_Am_M00t> that is irrelevant
[22:08:58] <I_Am_M00t> you didn't understand that.
[22:09:08] <biys> not really.  as a result of evolution those biological inclinations might change
[22:09:11] <biys> that is how evolution wo rks
[22:09:20] <Ungwelian> It's important not to be cartesian about the biological nature of values, too. I mean, just because there are psychobehavioural components doesn't mean there are no biological components.
[22:09:22] <Ungwelian> And vice versa.
[22:09:25] <I_Am_M00t> so can you answer the question instead of evading?
[22:09:32] <Ungwelian> For example, behaviour such as infatuation.
[22:09:33] <biys> Ungwelian: that is kind of where i am too
[22:10:06] <I_Am_M00t> because you objected to your professors belief in transcendental values, yet you seem to hold christian values as transcendental. If you don't see them as such, just say no
[22:10:22] <I_Am_M00t> it's simple
[22:10:31] <biys> ive already said that though

[22:21:58] <I_Am_M00t> no
[22:22:42] <biys> Ungwelian: i think that being a liar also works though.  we can see examples where people who have lied have had very successful lives
[22:23:49] <Ungwelian> I think the problem came from this line:
[22:23:50] <Ungwelian> <biys> I_Am_M00t: i think it is both possible and impossible that christian values will transcend time and space.
[22:24:06] <biys> that could be
[22:24:09] <I_Am_M00t> no Ungwelian
[22:24:25] *** Joins: Gerula (~Gerula@user/gerula)
[22:24:28] <I_Am_M00t> that was just an example of his word salads and muddled language
[22:24:52] <biys> his?
[22:25:00] <biys> i'd prefer if you called me they
[22:25:11] <I_Am_M00t> i know he cherishes christian values, from beforehand
[22:25:16] <Ungwelian> biys, what's the definition of "successful life" ?
[22:25:26] <Ungwelian> Happiness, flourishing, so on?
[22:25:29] <biys> Ungwelian: thats a good question!
[22:25:36] <Ungwelian> I mean, you used the term :P
[22:26:17] <biys> i know i did.  success is also subjective, to some extent.  i'll give you an example.  my sister always tells me she's "content" with very little money and a small house.  yet she always makes comments about peopel who drive nice cars and have big houses
[22:26:29] <biys> i think her comments about being "content" are a matter of saving face
[22:26:32] <Ungwelian> So being content is part of it?
[22:26:45] <biys> i don't think i'd ever be content necessarily
[22:26:49] <biys> there is always so much to do and learn
[22:27:02] <Ungwelian> You'd be happy doing and learning?
[22:27:12] <I_Am_M00t> :)
[22:27:19] <biys> successful in this modern age has a lot of factors i'd say
[22:28:01] <biys> 13:57 < Ungwelian> You'd be happy doing and learning?  <-- this isn't what i even remotely suggested.
[22:28:10] <biys> it is unlikely that for any significant time i'd be "content"
[22:28:25] <biys> something will change my perspective

[22:29:03] *** Quits: Pixi (~Pixi@user/pixi) (Quit: Leaving)
[22:29:20] <biys> i then have a desire to understand or accomplish whatever is necessary as a result of my discovery
[22:29:29] <Ungwelian> Would you agree with this:
[22:29:29] <Ungwelian> "The joy of life consists in the exercise of one's energies, continual growth, constant change, the enjoyment of every new experience.
[22:29:30] <Ungwelian> To stop means simply to die. The eternal mistake of mankind is to set up an attainable ideal."
[22:30:01] <I_Am_M00t> lol
[22:30:11] <biys> yes, but i would say that it is likely i feel the way i do as a result of some form of indoctrination
[22:30:20] <Ungwelian> Aleister Crowley.
[22:31:43] <Ungwelian> So do you think indoctrination can install feelings into people arbitrarily?
[22:32:02] <biys> i think children are born tabula rasa
[22:32:20] <Ungwelian> "No man is an island" :)
[22:32:31] <biys> John what's his name
[22:32:41] <biys> Donne
[22:33:01] <biys> keep in mind Donne is also catholic isn't he?
[22:33:12] <biys> int hat poem he talks about the body of the church
[22:33:22] <Ungwelian> How extreme are you in your tabula rasa belief?

[22:33:46] <biys> well i've already suggested that there could be inherent biological functions to some extent or another

[22:34:00] <biys> cause that causes a lot of problems for some peopel
[22:34:17] <biys> no man is an island is only part of the poem
[22:34:23] <biys> the whole thing is the meditations 14
[22:34:33] * Ungwelian nods
[22:34:47] <Ungwelian> Meditation XVII
[22:35:09] <biys> 17
[22:35:09] <biys> yah
[22:35:47] <biys> The church is Catholic, universal, so are all her
[22:35:47] <biys> actions; all that she does belongs to all. When she baptizes a child, that action
[22:35:50] <biys> concerns me; for that child is thereby connected to that body which is my
[22:35:53] <biys> head too, and ingrafted into that body whereof I am a member.
[22:36:15] <biys> tbh i don't like Donne
[22:36:20] <Ungwelian> Heh :)
[22:36:31] <Ungwelian> Do you think there's such a thing as normalcy?
[22:36:58] <biys> i don't think we know enough about the orld/universe to be able to make any specific claim with any kind of accuracy
[22:37:29] <biys> Spinoza says in order to know god you have to know how everything around you works
[22:37:37] <biys> i don't think we've scratched the surface
[22:37:37] <Ungwelian> There's much science gathered already by e.g. developmental psychology.
[22:37:54] <Ungwelian> On how to raise a child with a healthy psyche.
[22:38:10] <biys> in this time and space sure
[22:38:26] <Ungwelian> Wouldn't it be prudent to behave in this time and space?
[22:38:26] <biys> that isn't to say that the way we raise a child with a healthy psyche is always and will always be accurate
[22:38:48] <biys> i'd also say that it depends signifiacntly on where that child is
[22:38:51] *** Quits: Adiemus (~Maranatha@p4fe3426f.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[22:39:04] <Ungwelian> Let's say where you live.
[22:39:09] <biys> i'll give you an example.  if i grew up 8 mile detroit and you grew up bevery hills 90210 our ideas of normal might be significantly different
[22:39:18] <biys> where i'd sag my pants and wear a backwards ball cap you might wear khakis and a polo
[22:39:44] <biys> that isn't to say that either of our understanding of the world is more or less accurate
[22:39:50] <biys> we're simply victims of our intersectionality
[22:40:20] <Ungwelian> It's true that people differ, of course. Don't you think there are any basic psychological qualities to humans, or even animals?
[22:40:48] <biys> this makes me think of the Romanian Orphans TBH
[22:40:59] <biys> https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/07/can-an-unloved-child-learn-to-love/612253/
[22:41:00] <ro-bot-o> [url] The Romanian Orphans Are Adults Now - The Atlantic | www.theatlantic.com
[22:41:36] <Ungwelian> The structure of the mind is such, that it piles on what has already happened, but attention isn't fortunately everywhere all the time.
[22:41:45] <Ungwelian> People aren't entirely slaves to their history.
[22:42:26] <Ungwelian> You could think of it as an upside down pyramid of concepts.
[22:42:47] <Ungwelian> Growing with the development of consciousness.
[22:43:06] <biys> well i mean, no
[22:43:21] <biys> there is a foundation
[22:43:28] <biys> that foundation could be misaligned
[22:43:35] <Ungwelian> What foundation?
[22:43:38] <biys> or else the Romanian Orphans wouldn't have the problems they have
[22:43:41] <biys> adapting to society
[22:44:18] <Ungwelian> I didn't read it, but from the headline, it sounds like a horrifying experiment.
[22:44:42] <Ungwelian> If they're really left without positive affect.
[22:44:48] <Ungwelian> I'd rate that as torture.
[22:46:31] <Ungwelian> That's something that people learn too. And when you're very young, you have a pristine, clear mind.
[22:46:56] <Ungwelian> The body is growing, the brain as well.
[22:47:19] <Ungwelian> Remembering is easy.
[22:47:24] *** Quits: Atque (~Atque@user/atque) (Quit: ...)
[22:48:13] <Ungwelian> Without affect, you don't learn it when young, which most people do.
[22:48:26] <Ungwelian> When older, learning is already much more difficult.
[22:48:38] <Ungwelian> And you already have psychological baggage below in the pyramid.
[22:49:46] <biys> i think that the psychological assesment for people like Kemper or the BTK Killer or even Manson were something like... they were damaged by their mothers at an early age
[22:49:56] <biys> resulting in their ideations being problematic
[22:50:00] <Ungwelian> Top that with neglected hospital food etc. and you likely have malnutrition, further exacerbating learning disabilities.
[22:50:07] <biys> true
[22:50:21] <biys> so to me it seems as though the suggestions in the current context
[22:50:27] <biys> of what an appropriate person looks like/believes
[22:50:39] <biys> is based on a lot of factors that aren't necessarily controllable by the individual
[22:50:49] <Ungwelian> Most definitely.
[22:50:50] <biys> so to suggest that there is a more or less accurate way to live within the world is problematic
[22:51:07] <Ungwelian> Is living only about individual behaviour?
[22:51:45] <Ungwelian> I'd say such people like Manson, damaged individuals, caused a lot of pain with their behaviour.
[22:52:18] <biys> definitely the effects those people have on the social group they reside is worthy of mention
[22:52:24] <biys> but that seems outside the context of this conversation
[22:52:29] <Ungwelian> Why?
[22:52:37] <biys> it isn't really their fault
[22:52:40] <biys> it's societies fault
[22:52:45] <Ungwelian> Of course.
[22:53:04] <Ungwelian> What was done to them was immoral, on many levels.
[22:53:12] <biys> 'eh.  idk about immoral
[22:53:16] <Ungwelian> "Fault"
[22:53:24] <biys> it is within the realm of possibilities
[22:54:38] <biys> see
[22:54:52] <biys> your idea that it is immoral is based on an idea that you have about the most accurate way to be raised
[22:55:00] <biys> based on your presuppositions associated with their underpinning
[22:55:07] <biys> (i'll call it judeo christian indoctrination)
[22:55:12] <Ungwelian> Developmental psychology :)
[22:55:19] <Ungwelian> Other concepts too.
[22:55:33] <biys> sure, but it's associated with an idea of what's considered most adirable given the context of something or another
[22:55:48] <Ungwelian> "A successful life"
[22:55:57] <I_Am_M00t> Are, say, Indians also under judeo christian indoctrination?
[22:56:07] <I_Am_M00t> muslims?
[22:56:08] <biys> I_Am_M00t: to some extent yes
[22:56:15] <biys> muslims are abrahamic religion
[22:56:19] <I_Am_M00t> Buddhists?
[22:56:21] <biys> so it's kind of smiilar but kind of different
[22:56:26] <biys> you mean Taoism?
[22:56:31] <I_Am_M00t> sure
[22:56:56] <biys> I_Am_M00t: you also need to keep in mind that earlier i said "the most current iteration"
[22:57:02] <biys> you seem hung up on judeo-christian
[22:57:14] <biys> i'm using it to describe a certain set of values that are currently held at this point in time
[22:57:18] <I_Am_M00t> where's the hangup?
[22:57:51] <biys> western values
[22:57:54] <biys> western modernity
[22:57:59] <I_Am_M00t> I'd call those modern western values
[22:58:09] <biys> i'd say their origin is very christian
[22:58:18] <I_Am_M00t> ahh
[22:58:40] <biys> if it smells like a duck, looks like a duck, tastes like a duck
[22:58:41] <I_Am_M00t> capitalism is also christian?
[22:58:42] <biys> it's a duck my friend
[22:59:16] <biys> are you asking me if capitalism is compatible with christianity?
[22:59:45] <I_Am_M00t> no, I'm asking if modern capitalism has its origin in Christianity
[23:00:02] <I_Am_M00t> give that capitalism is a large part of the world today
[23:00:15] <I_Am_M00t> given*
[23:00:43] <biys> what do you mean "capitalism" and what do you mean "origins in christianity" ?
[23:01:19] <I_Am_M00t> hehe
[23:01:27] <I_Am_M00t> evasion is nice
[23:01:33] <biys> no, i just know how you work
[23:01:41] <biys> i could answer the question but then you'd move the goal posts
[23:01:48] <biys> so i'm asking you to solidify your question
[23:01:53] <Ungwelian> Weber would say capitalism is the culmination of Christianity :)
[23:01:58] <I_Am_M00t> i am seeing if you're cohesive
[23:02:01] <biys> i was gonna say read some Max Weber
[23:02:12] <I_Am_M00t> my question is fine
[23:02:27] <biys> your question is problematic because i know how you work.  you move goal posts by redefining words on a regular basis
[23:02:33] <biys> youa ct like this is the first time i'ev seen you chat
[23:02:38] <I_Am_M00t> I'm mot moving goal posts
[23:02:58] <biys> so solidify your question by outlining what you mean by capitalism as well as "origins in christianity"
[23:03:19] <biys> given that capitalism is a newer invention i'd say that it does have some origin in christianity
[23:03:25] <biys> but i'm not sure what you think you mean when you ask the question

[23:06:49] <biys> tbh i don't even think you know what you're asking hah
[23:06:55] <biys> which is why you can't really elaborate on it
[23:07:04] <I_Am_M00t> ah, no i know
[23:07:10] <biys> what do you know?
[23:07:35] <biys> iirc aren't you the one who thinks people are compelled in some way or another to buy apple iphones?
[23:08:12] <biys> and you think that the apple model is problematic
[23:08:24] <I_Am_M00t> :) hehe
[23:08:31] <Ungwelian> From what I've gathered, biys, you seem like a person who's searching for answers.
[23:08:32] <biys> as a result of they don't let you repair your apple products
[23:08:44] <biys> Ungwelian: oh definitely.
[23:08:50] <Ungwelian> I can respect that.
[23:09:11] <biys> the biggest question at this point semes to be... how do people like I_Am_M00t come to the conclusion that their understanding of the world is accurate
[23:09:15] <biys> thus their theory of how to operate within the world
[23:09:19] <biys> i wish i was that sure of myself
[23:09:25] <biys> that would be so liberating
[23:09:29] <Ungwelian> I can't speak for M00t, but I can speak for myself.
[23:10:37] <I_Am_M00t> biys: nice evasion
[23:10:38] <biys> some people believe so firmly in what they think yet they can't even articulate the origins of the thoughts
[23:10:45] <I_Am_M00t> a complete topic switch
[23:10:54] <biys> they kind of just throw their hands up in the air and say something like: "well it's obvious isn't it?!"
[23:11:17] <tomathy> hmm origin of thoughts
[23:11:37] <I_Am_M00t> maybe the origins of my thoughts are christian?
[23:11:40] <I_Am_M00t> hehe
[23:11:57] <biys> I_Am_M00t: it is likely that a portion of the ideations you have are as a result of some form of judeo-christian indoctrination
[23:12:11] <tomathy> judeo christian pah
[23:12:19] <biys> i'd even go as far as to say a significant portion
[23:12:32] <I_Am_M00t> is that so now?
[23:12:37] <I_Am_M00t> tell me more
[23:13:07] <I_Am_M00t> you seem very certain of this
[23:13:13] <biys> i would say it's inherent at htis point with being part of western modernity
[23:13:27] <I_Am_M00t> define western modernity
[23:13:55] <biys> you don't elaborate on things further
[23:14:01] <biys> so at this point
