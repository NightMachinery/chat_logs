[00:03:39] <Boarders_> I am using zig-mode in emacs but it is quite annoying as if I save and there is a parse error then I will lose focus as it pops up the error in a separate buffer
[00:03:53] <Boarders_> can I change this easily or is there a suggested workflow that makes it nicer?

[02:31:48] <Seng> I think Zig just optimized me into success! I wrote to some stack memory in a function, and returned that memory. But it wasn't garbage at that point and my AoC soltion was correct.
[02:32:14] <Seng> Then I did part2, did things slightly diffrent, yet returned old stack memory and everything was written in elvish.
[02:32:55] <Seng> I keep forgetting that there are two kinds of memory unlike in C# that I'm used to ((:
[02:33:22] <Seng> (I know technically C# also works with heap and stack, but I, as a developer, doesn't have to think about it)

[20:08:46] <Seng> Hey, I'd like to make heap's algorithm but using a pattern in zig like with mem.split that returns a SplitIterator so you can lazily loop over it. Heap's algorithm does a lot of recursion and every single example I can find appends the results to a list. Though I want my implementation to be Allocator-free. Anyone with any pointers as to what I could look towards for inspiration on how to implement my idea? 
[20:08:55] <Seng> (it's a long shot, I know) 
[20:15:14] <shachaf> You want to iterate over the contents of a binary heap in order without mutating it?
[20:20:03] <Seng> It's an algorithm to permutate the elements of a list. 
[20:21:11] <Seng> I might just not understand it properly yet. 
[20:21:19] <Seng> I will prevail! 
[20:24:20] <ifreund> Seng: that algorithm inherently requires space overhead equivlaent to the number of elements you are permutating
[20:24:52] <ifreund> this overhead can be in the form of the function call stack if using recursion or a simple array of length N if using a non recursive approach
[20:25:01] <shachaf> Wait, Heap is the name of a person? Oh no.
[20:25:53] <ifreund> you can either allocate a slice of length N on the heap with an allocator on initializing your iterator or require N to be comptime known and use an array in zig

[21:47:30] <tsmanner_> Has there been any discussion about changing the default branch from master to main?
[21:49:58] <Franciman> why?
[21:50:36] <Franciman> i'd prefer develop to main
[21:53:19] <tsmanner_> Just curious, the "new" convention on github is main, but develop is just as valid.  It was part of the push I think in 2020 to remove references to the words master and (usually implied) slave there.  I caught myself typing `git pull zig main` a few minutes ago out of habit.
[21:54:19] <Franciman> sure
[21:55:36] <Franciman> if this is the convention, maybe we should adapt
[21:55:41] <Franciman> but will it break something?
[21:55:53] <Franciman> also i am not entitled to speak, i can just give opinions sorry
[21:56:11] <Franciman> i personally avoid git
[21:57:31] <tsmanner_> Got it.  I'm in the same boat, just curious about it.  It looks like GitHub will automatically redirect links to missing or deleted branches to the default branch, but I do imagine there would be some breakage somewhere.
[21:58:37] <tsmanner_> Sidebar: Franciman what do you usually reach for when you need VCS?
[21:59:06] <Franciman> either fossil or darcs
[21:59:28] <Franciman> lately i was attuned by bazaar, but i don't know what to think about it
[22:00:47] <tsmanner_> I briefly looked at bazaar a while back too, but I haven't tried it.  Fossil and darcs look interesting, I hadn't heard of them before.
[22:04:39] <earnestly> breezy is the fork of bazaar to continue its development
[22:05:05] <earnestly> Which may be the third reboot attempt
[22:05:41] <rom1504> are there platforms that support non-git ?
