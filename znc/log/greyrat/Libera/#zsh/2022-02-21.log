[00:29:26] <Mikachu> generally zsh doesn't examine random memory and execute anything that looks like it could be shell code, unlike bash, but it also hasn't really had extensive security audits (afaik)

[13:19:58] <birkoff> i have extendedglob set but the filename generation pattern ^x dont seem to work. i.e. *^(*.log) or ^(*.log) or ^(.log) which I expect to show me all files that dont end with .log extension instead zsh shows zsh: number expected
[13:20:46] <Mikachu> those probably get parsed as bare globquals
[13:20:58] <Mikachu> you can just drop the parens
[13:21:32] <Mikachu> though the first one will match all files
[13:21:38] <Mikachu> and the last one also
[13:21:46] <Mikachu> the middle one looks correct though, eg ^*.log
[13:22:05] <Mikachu> birkoff: ^
[13:22:05] <birkoff> yeah

[13:23:12] <birkoff> why does the first one show all files ? 
[13:23:17] <Mikachu> because you have a *
[13:23:22] <Mikachu> it will match the entire filename
[13:23:42] <birkoff> so it's like a logical OR ? 
[13:23:44] <Mikachu> then the ^*.log part matches the empty string at the end of the filename (which will not be excluded because it doesn't match the glob *.log)
[13:24:12] <Mikachu> think of ^foo as a * that cannot itself expand to match foo
[13:24:37] <Mikachu> it can expand to any other string
[13:24:48] <birkoff> what the empty string at the end of the filename ? 
[13:25:13] <Mikachu> > touch foo.log; echo foo.log*
[13:25:13] *** Parts: toastloop (~toastloop@user/toastloop) (Leaving)
[13:25:15] <machabot> Mikachu: foo.log
[13:25:17] <Mikachu> is this result surprising to you?
[13:25:20] <birkoff> no
[13:25:25] <Mikachu> the * at the end matches the empty string at the end of the filename
[13:25:44] <Mikachu> > touch foo.log; echo foo.log^*.log
[13:25:44] <machabot> Mikachu: foo.log
[13:25:46] <Mikachu> same thing here

[13:25:51] <machabot> Mikachu: foo.log
[13:25:52] <Mikachu> and here also

[13:27:42] <machabot> birkoff: /dev/stdin:1: no matches found: foo.log^*.log
[13:29:02] <Mikachu> right, here the .log at the end can't be matched by ^*.log because it matches *.log
[13:29:17] <Mikachu> > touch foo.log.log; echo foo.log.^*.log
[13:29:17] <machabot> Mikachu: foo.log.log
[13:29:23] <Mikachu> but it won't match log, etc etc
[13:30:53] <Mikachu> or will, rather
[13:43:36] <birkoff> why can't Y glob modifier be used together with o modifier ? i.e. *(OmY1) 
[13:43:51] <Mikachu> because it aborts the glob as soon as it finds n matches
[13:43:54] <Mikachu> you want Om[1]
[13:44:17] <birkoff> but the first match should be already sorted by my selection ?
[13:44:24] <Mikachu> it is indeed sorted
[13:44:28] <Mikachu> sorting one element is very fast
[13:45:32] <birkoff> so it doesn't finish the sort at all
[13:45:43] <Mikachu> i guess it's just a matter of semantics
[13:45:50] <Mikachu> but Yn will abort glob after finding n elements
[13:45:56] <Mikachu> those n elements will then be sorted
[13:46:52] <birkoff> I see

[16:27:35] <mort> If you want color in your shell in bash, you put the literal byte 1 (ASCII start of heading) before the ANSI escape sequence for the color, and literal byte 2 (ASCII start of text) after the sequence for the color, and then readline won't count the bytes inbetween as characters which move the cursor. How exactly does the same work in zsh?
[16:27:48] *** Joins: eroux (~eroux@102-65-85-242.ftth.web.africa)
[16:28:02] <Mikachu> could you phrase that as a question that doesn't involve bash
[16:28:29] <mort> alright, sure
[16:29:39] <mort> how, specifically, does zsh know not to update its line editor's cursor position between %{ and %}? Does it work by translating %{ and %} to special bytes which the line editor then understands, or does its line editor itself parse the string and read %{ and %}?
[16:30:06] <Mikachu> you're talking about the prompt being colored, then?
[16:30:11] <mort> yes
[16:30:16] <Mikachu> the cursor never moves into the prompt so i'm not sure what the confusion is
[16:30:21] <mort> sorry, I notice I didn't mention PS1
[16:30:24] <Mikachu> all we need to know is where the input starts
[16:30:36] <Mikachu> so we count all characters, but not anything between %{ %}
[16:30:38] <mort> you need to know what column the editable portion of the line starts
[16:30:50] <mort> right
[16:30:52] <Mikachu> you can also use %G for the opposite effect
[16:31:22] <mort> so you parse the %{ and %} itself, you don't somehow convert %{ and %} into other bytes and then interpret those
[16:32:15] <Mikachu> are you looking to implement the same thing in another shell? eg, why do you care how it works? :)
[16:33:00] <mort> I'm making a program which is supposed to print a prompt, to be used as PS1='$(my-program)'
[16:33:44] <Mikachu> all you need to know is anything inside %{ will not affect the cursor placement calculation (so it better not actually print a visible character)
[16:33:55] <mort> turned out that in bash, my-program should output bytes 1 and 2 rather than the sequences "\[" and "\]" because bash only translates "\[" and "\]" within the string literal in PS1; I want to make sure it's correct that my-command prints "%{" and "%}"
[16:34:19] <mort> but it sounds like zsh doesn't have the same weirdness as bash, so that's nice
[16:34:35] <Mikachu> http://mika.l3ib.org/tmp/5df3bd05d59af98871a137733c9ffc22.txt is the relevant code (most likely)
[16:35:02] <danielsh> Mikachu, (see /query)
[16:35:32] <Mikachu> mort: most of the time you don't need to use %{ and raw bytes at all, because there are % codes for everything useful already
[16:38:22] <mort> don't you still need %{ and %} when using $fg tho
[16:45:47] <leah2> sven guckes died tonight
[16:46:48] <leah2> at least in german-speaking countries, he's been a huge advocate of zsh
[16:47:12] <Han> :'(
[16:50:31] <Mikachu> mort: use %F
[16:51:16] <mort> ah
[16:53:29] <ccx> I think I've used %{ %} for special escape to set terminal title but that's about it.

[20:11:55] <danielsh> preferred way to do a lookup in a static const char*[20]?   straight loop is good enough, or should I bring in bsearch/newhashtable?
[20:14:58] <Mikachu> a little hard to answer without any context
[20:17:45] <bremner> is this lookup a bottleneck?
[20:21:15] <danielsh> sorry.  it's a list of parameter names exempted from warncreateglobal, as in workers/27741
[20:21:43] <Mikachu> so every time a parameter is implicitly global, you loop over and strcmp with 20 strings?
[20:21:44] <danielsh> my hunch is that a straight loop would do, but I don't have data
[20:21:47] <danielsh> yeah
[20:22:01] <Mikachu> i guess you don't run performance critical code with wcg enabled anyway
[20:22:13] <Mikachu> more than once, at least
[20:23:01] <danielsh> not sure about that.  some people might set wcg _particularly_ for critical code, like 'use warnings;' in perl
[20:23:24] <Mikachu> idk if i would want reply to silently slip through
[20:24:13] <Mikachu> (i'm not against it, but it doesn't feel 100% right either) :)
[20:24:43] <Mikachu> i feel like c) makes more sense there (and for e:: globqual?)
[20:25:16] <danielsh> zstyle -e :foo bar myfunc <- should have warncreateglobal surely?
[20:25:58] <Mikachu> since 'reply' is "consumed" by zstyle, it should be localled in an extra function context that zstyle runs in, ideally
[20:25:59] <danielsh> make the check conditional on eval context too?
[20:26:13] <danielsh> +1
[20:26:23] <Mikachu> eg, as if it was consumed by a function zstyle() { local reply; eval $4 }
[20:26:40] <danielsh> right.  like $BUFFER
[20:26:56] <Mikachu> just checked and *(e::) does warn too, and leaks the value out to the caller
[20:27:07] <Mikachu> so if you do REPLY=foo; echo *(e:REPLY=bar:) then REPLY is bar after
[20:27:16] <Mikachu> i guess perhaps someone somewhere depends on this though
[20:27:48] <Mikachu> and in fact if you do this
[20:27:51] <danielsh> in general reply/REPLY should be assumed to never be valid except right after set
[20:28:01] <Mikachu> > REPLY=foo; touch bar{1..3}; echo *(e::); echo $REPLY
[20:28:01] <machabot> Mikachu: bar1 bar2 bar3

[20:28:46] <machabot> Mikachu: .
[20:29:19] <danielsh> maybe we should just suppress the warning for reply/REPLY after all, and tell people never to rely on their values?
[20:29:28] <Mikachu> i think we already tell people that
[20:29:36] <danielsh> yeah
[20:29:56] <danielsh> I'm just not sure any more special casing zstyle to _not_ leak that makes sense
[20:30:23] <Mikachu> i guess not
[20:30:36] <Mikachu> but i wonder if it could get called implicitly by some prompt-redrawing code
[20:30:48] <Mikachu> and clobber your $reply even though you didn't even accept a commandline
[20:30:56] <Mikachu> probably not

[20:40:27] <Mikachu> worth making a mental note to local reply in such hooks
[20:40:41] <Mikachu> and this seems to me to be an argument *for* printing the warning, if anything
[20:41:17] <danielsh> it's one of my precmd funcs
[20:41:42] <Mikachu> eg, if you incorrectly write this function without local reply, it clobbers reply, and you want to remove the warning explicitly enabled by the user for exactly this case
[20:42:09] <danielsh> so this is an argument for making zstyle localize reply after all
[20:42:14] <danielsh> and e:: too I guess
[20:42:36] <Mikachu> this is just my opinion, but printing the warning or making them implicitly local are my favorite options
[20:42:42] <Mikachu> hiding the warning seems counterproductive
[20:43:08] <danielsh> the leak is somewhere in vcs_info
[20:43:18] <danielsh> which explicitly unsets that option (that's how that thread started)

[21:46:25] <Mikachu> oh speaking of tests, i have this in master
[21:46:32] <Mikachu> Test ./E03posix.ztst was expected to fail, but passed.
[21:46:32] <Mikachu> Was testing: Width of %s is computed in bytes not characters
[21:46:32] <Mikachu> ./E03posix.ztst: test XPassed.
[21:46:32] <Mikachu> The following may (or may not) help identifying the cause:
[21:46:32] <Mikachu>   This is considered a bugfix in zsh
[21:46:55] <Mikachu> was this fixed and someone forgot to remove xfail?
[21:46:58] <Mikachu> or is my system magical
[21:49:44] <danielsh> not sure
[21:50:04] <danielsh> what does bin_printf do with 's'?
[21:54:27] <Mikachu> also not sure
[21:54:42] <Mikachu> if i replace two characters with a single ま it misaligns for me though so no idea what's going on
[21:54:49] <Mikachu> (3 bytes, 2 cells wide)
[21:54:50] <danielsh> one more thing
[21:54:57] <danielsh> I tried the printf manually, outside the test suite

[21:56:09] <Mikachu> with LC_ALL=C it works
[21:56:17] <Mikachu> but also wouldn't consider it a bug in this case
[21:56:36] <Mikachu> hmm, also with LC_ALL=sv_SE.UTF-8
[21:56:50] <Mikachu> but my LC_CTYPE is set to that, and LC_ALL is unset
[21:56:52] <Mikachu> confusion
[21:56:56] <danielsh> LC_ALL=C gives me a single space.  which is reasonable
[21:57:47] <Mikachu> oh these are explicitly run with sh emulation too
[21:57:58] <danielsh> the tests run force some locales but not others
[21:58:05] <danielsh> oh forgot that
[21:58:22] <danielsh> still produces expected output interactively
[21:58:37] <danielsh> try running 'locale' in the test and removing the 'f' flag so we see what locale it runs as ?
[21:59:25] <Mikachu> i'm very confused by this test, when i edit the command, it doesn't change the result of the test, but if i remove the whole line it complains about a syntax error, so i AM editing the right file...
[21:59:40] <danielsh> the test has the 'f' flag 
[21:59:46] <Mikachu> oh right
[22:00:35] <Mikachu> it has my locale except LANG=C which is irrelevant
[22:01:17] <danielsh> my locale is C.UTF-8 (mostly) and I get plain C instead
[22:01:26] <danielsh> I wonder if the test should move to D07multibyte
[22:02:04] <danielsh> yeah it passes in D07 without f
[22:03:36] <Mikachu> still fails with a doublewidth japanese char though
[22:03:40] <Mikachu> very strange...
[22:04:04] <Mikachu> anyway, i guess it's not an urgent issue then
[22:05:24] <danielsh> with \'e and Japanese I get three spaces
[22:05:28] <danielsh> but in the test and interactively
[22:05:42] <danielsh> should still move the test though?
[22:05:56] <danielsh> or figure what sets the locale to C
[22:06:44] <danielsh> oh fun ztst.zsh:27-31
[22:08:15] <Mikachu> i don't get why i get different results when LANG is set to C, LANG isn't used since all my LC_* vars are set

[22:08:59] <danielsh> in D07 ?
[22:09:10] <danielsh> or in E03 ?
[22:09:13] <Mikachu> in E03
[22:10:32] <danielsh> so with LANG=C it fails as expected and with LANG unset it xpasses, right ? 
[22:11:18] <Mikachu> well, the only difference i could spot in the locale output was LANG, i didn't try unsetting it to see if that affected it...
[22:11:21] <phy1729> Seems more consistent to  unset $parameters[(I)LC_*]
[22:11:35] <danielsh> the modload may not be available
[22:11:38] <Mikachu> LANG *should* have no effect
[22:11:47] <danielsh> you remember that 'locale' output uses "" specially ?
[22:11:49] <Mikachu> just set LC_ALL
[22:11:50] <Mikachu> yeah
[22:11:52] <phy1729> It's loaded on L44

[22:12:23] <phy1729> Test/ztst.zsh
[22:12:44] <danielsh> line 43 is wrong though
[22:12:52] <danielsh> you would know :) 
[22:13:33] <phy1729> Yes but if no one has complained yet that zsh/parameter is required, I say keep it :)
[22:14:14] <danielsh> but how will we port zsh to abacuses? 
[22:14:28] <Mikachu> we can port zsh to other systems without requiring the full test suite to be available
[22:15:14] <danielsh> I was rather hoping my abacus would run the test suite... 
[22:15:55] <phy1729> Get it running zsh and I'll send the requisite patches for zsh/parameter
[22:16:18] <Mikachu> does zsh/parameter actually have any additional requirements, or is it just disableable because it's a module?

[22:19:15] <danielsh> what about that   () : *(e::); echo $REPLY thing, we're saying we want to keep it?
[22:19:31] <Mikachu> i think it could be controversial to change it
[22:20:29] <Mikachu> and i guess way too specific to have an option for
[22:20:56] <Mikachu> too bad all the uppercase globqual letters are taken for mostly useless stuff
[22:21:02] <danielsh> I'm thinking off a test with F: lines then to watch out for that
[22:21:13] <danielsh> we should reserve one letter as an extension letter
[22:21:21] <danielsh> so we can have *(Xa).. *(Xz) do new things
