[00:09:29] <lmat> I'm running nginx in a docker stack with the following docker-compose configuration: https://paste.rs/kqH
[00:10:01] <lmat> When I remove the "ports" part of that configuration, nothing changes. When I run docker container ls, for the ports section, it says, 
[00:10:32] <lmat> "80/tcp" but I expect something more like "0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp" maybe.
[00:11:05] <lmat> I'm trying another test right now. I added - 443:443 and - 12345:12345 ...starting up now.
[00:11:32] <lmat> it still just says "80/tcp". It appears that my "ports" section is being completely ignored. Is there anything in the service definition that looks incorrect to you all?
[00:14:50] <ada_> how are you invoking docker-compose, can you share your series of commands you ran to verify that the container was up and which ports are published?
[00:15:15] <ada_> off the bat it doesn't look like there's a syntax problem in your yaml
[00:15:19] <lmat> docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml;
[00:15:33] <ada_> and arey ou looking at "docker ps" to verify ports?
[00:15:50] <lmat> ada_: Thank you. I added the following entry under "ports":  "- - this - is invalid."  and docker agreed that it's invalid \o/ At least it's reading my file!
[00:15:51] <ada_> or container ls
[00:15:57] <lmat> docker container ls
[00:16:01] <ada_> ok, thats the issue
[00:16:04] <lmat> :-o
[00:16:04] <ada_> use service ls instead
[00:16:09] <lmat> okilie dokilie!
[00:16:27] <lmat> wow, much better, thank you!
[00:16:37] <ada_> for whatever reason, when containers are actually service tasks, the port publishing info is under the service ls instead of container ls
[00:16:40] <lmat> That makes sense: the ports are bound to the LOAD balancer, not the containers.
[00:16:44] <ada_> right

[00:33:40] <programmerq> jrabbit▸ it looks like the varnish official image has been maintained by the same person since it was added to the docker official images library in 2019, so I'm not sure what change you're referring to? It sounds more like you were tracking a non-version-specific tag and you got swapped over to a different version. That can happen from time to time unless you pin to a specific version. They do
[00:33:42] <programmerq> have a 'stable' tag that so far has pointed at a 6.0.x release during the whole existence of the image. You could also track their 6.0 tag. unless you're saying they completely refactored the image without a version tossup?
[00:34:18] <programmerq> oh you did call out the stable as having been changed. hmmm
[00:34:45] <programmerq> yeah, might bring that up over in #docker-library and see if tianon wants to weigh in on that. Or, you could bring it up on that github repo I mentioned earlier as a github issue?

[13:50:44] <roxlu> Is it possible to create a Dockerfile that uses a local container as it's FROM?
[13:52:55] <tabakhase> roxlu reword that pls...
[13:53:36] <tabakhase> i wanne say "yes sure", but your "a local container" crosses that out.... sure you mean a container, not a local image? ;-)
[13:54:18] <tabakhase> (cause "tunring containers back into images" is 'only allowed for exceptions', with docker-commit ;-))
[13:54:34] <roxlu> ok sorry :)  I have a project with a Dockerfile that I've used to build an image. This image is shared with some other people. I want to install some utils which are only used by myself and not by other members of my team so I don't want to add them in the Dockerfile. 
[13:55:23] <tabakhase> but like, docker-commit its literally the wrong sollution in 99% of the cases :D
[13:55:40] <tabakhase> okay that sounds fine, so no "containers" anywhere actually, youre just talkn images =)
[13:56:32] <roxlu> oh yeah you're right
[13:56:33] <tabakhase> then: "whats stoping you?" FROM name  will attempt to pick "name", if thats localy existent it doesnt even give a shit about whats on the hub or not
[13:56:49] <tabakhase> as in "will just work"
[13:57:04] <roxlu> tabakhase: ah I didn't know that; I thought that the `FROM [name]` would always use some/default registry
[13:57:55] <tabakhase> well technically it does, - so you may want to register a namespace on the hub just to make sure noone can squat in there i guess --- but hub is only step2 so to say
[13:59:18] <tabakhase> roxlu and i guess depending on usecase, having your "extra tools" stack ontop of the image may force lots of rebuilds -- consider swapping out the "image on the way up" (by using a build-arg and a dynamic FROM in your first dockerfile)
[13:59:35] <tabakhase> ((if / how that makes sense to your usecase depends, just wanted to have it mentioned))
[13:59:57] <roxlu> thanks for the tips tabakhase!

[14:40:32] <tabakhase> charolastra how so? --- and on a generic, "docker & email" doesnt fit together all that well, so generally you want to have your "things" use an actual smtp-server to send to the world (your companys mailserver/gmail/o360 or sending-services like mailchimp/sendgrid/ses and such
[14:42:02] <tabakhase> on the "custom image" thing - you want to keep images as generic as possible, runtime config is supposed to be shipped in on the "run", not the "build" - so env-vars and entrypoint to write/template a config or such are normally seen
[14:45:41] <tabakhase> charolastra and docker likes "one thing per container" - so alone the "run your thing + ssmtpd in one container" cleanly is quite the lift todo tbh... ideally your thing talks direct smtp to your gateway

[14:55:51] <charolastra> my thing is some PHP stuff which usually relies on the system mail infrastructure. also couldn't fine some plain alpine+nginx+php+mail images :(
[15:07:07] <BtbN> a random docker container can't just start mailing. A mail server is hugely complex
[15:07:18] <BtbN> most php programs support SMTP nowadays to talk to a proper mailserver
[15:08:19] <charolastra> actually it should just relay to the company mail server. and those are legacy apps

[17:30:51] <diverdude> hello :)
[17:32:07] <diverdude> Lets say i want to deploy a docker container in a clients computer... where client has full access to his computer..... Is there any way I can protect the data/code inside the image/container so that he cannot access it?
[17:32:36] <Habbie> no
[17:35:18] <dodo> diverdude: if anything runs on somebody else's hardware you can't prevent access
[17:36:36] <diverdude> dodo: can i at least make it difficult? Like password protect access or something?
[17:36:47] <Habbie> you can spend a lot of time on your end
[17:36:53] <Habbie> so that the person on the other end has to spend a little bit of time
[17:36:55] <Habbie> to still get your things
[17:37:04] <dodo> it's an exercise in futility
[17:37:12] <Habbie> yes
[17:37:18] <diverdude> For example i had to deploy a container from MS which i could not access
[17:37:28] <Habbie> why not?
[17:37:44] <dodo> diverdude: which business problem are you actually trying to solve?
[17:38:27] <diverdude> dodo: well... I have some code which i would like to protect....but i need to run the code on the clients machine because data is not allowed to leave their data center
[17:38:39] <Habbie> you'll have to choose
[17:38:43] <Habbie> protect the code, or protect the data
[17:38:58] <dodo> diverdude: that sounds like a contractual/legal problem, not a technical one
[17:39:28] <dodo> or, you could potentially put your own machine in their data center
[17:39:36] <gordonjcp> diverdude: what's the code written in?
[17:39:46] <dodo> (somebody with physical access could still get it all though)
[17:40:20] <diverdude> java/python
[17:41:47] <diverdude> yeah... i know that they could break into the container to get it....but if they at least had to violate some password access or something then they would have had to choose to get around that obstacle to get access which would be a clear breach of the contract
[17:41:57] <Habbie> right
[17:42:08] <Habbie> so, a legal problem :)
[17:42:19] <diverdude> yeah mainly a legal problem
[17:42:21] <diverdude> i agree
[17:42:24] <dodo> put an appliance in their data center, charge a hefty premium for it, and contracts
[17:43:03] <gordonjcp> diverdude: legally you can license it in such a way that they can't get at your code
[17:43:06] <diverdude> but i guess what i am looking for is some symbolic technical protection at least :)
[17:44:06] <dodo> i don't understand the paranoia tbh. why is your code so valuable that they would breach contracts?
[17:44:42] <diverdude> dodo: its machine learning models which has some IP attached to it
[17:44:49] <dodo> ah
[17:45:54] <diverdude> and then ofc. code surrounding it

[22:53:11] <tabakhase> not only that you "mostly shouldnt use this" - and do controlled deploys - for the cases where you want/can, consider tooling like https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower
[22:54:07] <tabakhase> there is another popular one that i cant remember the name of rn..
[22:55:11] <realies> I don't see why I shouldn't use this
[22:55:27] <realies> I'd rather not have to do it manually every week
[22:58:50] <realies> > docker image pull busybox:latest | grep "Image is up to date"
[22:58:51] <realies> ez
[22:59:31] <tang^> if you have already pulled don't you just need docker-compose up?
[22:59:42] <tabakhase> seeing a ":latest" in there makes it extra scarry :P
[23:01:32] <realies> tang^, docker image pull busybox:latest | grep "Image is up to date" && exit 0
[23:02:46] <tang^> no, doesn't `docker-compose up` recreated the container if the pulled image has changed? i.e. no need for down, nothing happens if the image is up to date
[23:02:50] <tang^> iirc
[23:02:53] <tang^> I'd have to try it out

[23:06:48] <tang^> I might be able to look at that later
[23:07:08] <realies> it works for me
[23:08:45] <tang^> I'm just curious if you can skip the `docker-compose down` without having to test whether `docker pull` changed anything
[23:10:27] <realies> why
[23:13:16] <tang^> because I'm curious
[23:13:30] <realies> it wont stop the old container instance
[23:13:39] <realies> and if the compose has a pinned name, it wont be able to start a new one
[23:14:35] <tang^> ah
