[00:04:46] <phoe> yes

[00:07:11] <shka> of counter-strike games
[00:08:31] <shka> and it is really convenient to have handler-bind for PRODUCT-ALREADY-EXISTS condition picking  either REPLACE-PRODUCT or USE-PRODUCT restarts
[00:08:46] <phoe> yes
[00:09:12] <shka> in general, condition system is shockingly useful for data pipelines constructions
[00:09:44] <shka> i would not expect that to be the case, but it really is
[00:11:12] <shka> it outshines macros, multimethods...

[01:09:53] <moon-child> consider what it means to display
[01:10:20] <moon-child> probably you only scan out from one buffer
[01:10:22] <gilberth> The CRTC scans the buffer. And?
[01:10:32] <moon-child> so 'display' means 'copy to the scanout buffer'
[01:11:02] <gilberth> Yes, you scan B while you render to A, flip, and then scan A, while you render B.
[01:11:26] <gilberth> moon-child: No copy needs to be made. Just tell the CRTC to scan the other buffer. A flip.
[01:12:00] <moon-child> how will you tell it that?

[01:12:36] <gilberth> moon-child: Tell it the start address or page of the video RAM to send to the CRT?
[01:12:52] <gilberth> Even VGA can do that.
[01:15:58] <gilberth> That was the my point, when your graphics board has two frame buffers and you switch which one is scanned out to the CRT by flipping a single bit or page number or offset at some control register, your back buffer is on the GPU. No copies are made.

[03:10:40] <gilberth> When I face the pathological case, I usually know about that and avoid that in the first place.
[03:11:56] <moon-child> gilberth: in scientific applications, you want your results to be reproducible
[03:12:18] <gilberth> If you do, you say so.
[03:12:20] <moon-child> what if I ran on a machine with 16-byte vectors, and then you tried to reproduce the results on a machine with 32-byte vectors, changing the order in which stuff got added?
[03:12:58] <moon-child> my point is, the default should be reproducible and correct.  If you want to sacrifice that, _then_ you say so
[03:13:03] <gilberth> Then it's a compiler bug. Oh wait a second, does C even make any promises here?

[03:13:29] <moon-child> i believe it does

[13:42:54] <hayley> But I think I've come on a generalisation of test-and-test-and-set or something. Have a "guess" predicate that can be tested without locking, and such that there are false positives but no false negatives, and you can do something like { if (guess) { lock(); actually-test-and-set(); unlock() } and if your guess predicate is precise enough, you won't hit the lock too frequently.
[13:44:10] <moon-child> yeah I have seen that
[13:44:51] <moon-child> usually in the form of:  if (something == whatever) { lock(); if (something actually == whatever) do shit; unlock(); }
[13:44:59] <hayley> I'm not saying I found it first, it's just neat :)
[13:45:14] <hayley> Yeah, that's what I mean by "test and test and set" - the inner "test and set" is your atomic operation.
[13:45:28] <hayley> But this is "filter and test and set", as the initial filter doesn't have to be precise.
[13:46:15] <hayley> e.g. in a GC I can totally stomach a situation wherein e.g. T1 reads an object is white, T2 reads it's white, does all the motion and then colours it grey, T1 grabs the lock and finds out the object is grey now.
[13:48:26] <hayley> More formally, say our test function is satisfied by states T, and our filter is satisfied by states F. Then we need T \subset F for correctness, and the "efficiency" is inversely proportional to | F \ T |. Test-and-test-and-set is when T = F.
[13:56:07] <selwyn> shka: really?
[13:56:18] <shka> selwyn: yeah
[13:56:44] <shka> starlink cubesats are located on a very low earth orbit
[13:56:57] <shka> so the latency is low, you know
[13:57:04] <selwyn> the astronomers are pissed
[13:57:09] <selwyn> (if media is accurate)
[13:57:12] <shka> they are
[13:57:45] <shka> anyway, thing is, starlink sats have just few years of practical endurance in orbit
[13:57:58] <shka> shorter if not boosted
[13:58:46] <ck_> well, in terms of "space pollution" no satellite is that bad. There's a lot of space you know, I mean you might think it is a ways down the street to the corner shop but that is just nothing in relation to [...]
[13:59:19] <dave0> hayley: please no test-and-test-and-set :-(
[13:59:27] <hayley> lol, I can't link mas.to on Twitter, because apparently it has "harmful content". It's probably harmful for Twitter's revenue, sure. 
[13:59:33] <shka> selwyn: so anyway, if one of the starlink satelites cease to function, it won't stay decades or centuries in orbit
[13:59:33] <hayley> dave0: But this is filter-and-test-and-set.
[13:59:52] <selwyn> ok, but this only means the pollution is short lived
[13:59:57] <selwyn> which is an upside i suppose
[14:00:05] <selwyn> like the ozone layer
[14:00:36] <shka> the main problem with this whole concept is the sheer number of launches you need to maintain this constellation 
[14:00:38] <hayley> Generational pollution? Sure, why not.
[14:01:10] <shka> falcon 9 is cheap, but is simply not cheap enough to do that in a cost effective way
[14:01:19] <hayley> dave0: test-and-test-and-set is when filter == test. But my generalisation is...more general.
[14:02:00] <shka> without superheavy this is essentially a pipe dream

[14:04:21] <shka> iirc one of the providers plans to offer 100mb from the geostationary orbit 
[14:04:39] <shka> and they are damn close to do so

[14:17:17] <dave0> hayley: you could just lock every time

[14:23:48] <hayley> Yes, my resume is also TeXed. But no one that has looked at it ever hired me.
[14:29:22] <selwyn> not yet

[14:31:14] <selwyn> with a nuclear reactor
[14:31:27] <shka> huh
[14:31:29] <shka> weird

[14:32:53] <shka> selwyn: yes, that is that famed space tug
[14:33:03] <shka> shame that it is supposed to launch on the angara
[14:33:43] <shka> but it is not super heavy launch vehicle by an means 
[14:33:51] <shka> that's why i was confused
[14:33:59] <selwyn> oh
[14:34:12] <selwyn> iirc the economist reported it as such
[14:34:18] <selwyn> what is super heavy anyway
[14:34:25] <selwyn> heavier than saturn v?
[14:35:02] <pl> Looks like restart of the original Buran system space tug, but interplanetary 
[14:35:14] <shka> usually super heavy means 50 metric tons to LEO
[14:35:25] <pl> I guess electric propulsion nixed original mission from Buran era 
[14:35:51] <shka> technically falcon heavy is super heavy launch platform
[14:36:03] <pl> selwyn: both S5 and Energia were in their own class of 100t to LEO 
[14:36:03] <shka> but is not used as such in practice

[14:36:39] <shka> well, there was also N1
[14:37:22] <shka> and that shuttle derived rocket NASA is working on is also very close to that 100t to LEO
[14:37:54] <pl> N1 was formally in super heavy range but much less than 100t 
[14:38:20] <shka> what was the mass of the space shuttle orbiter?
[14:39:02] <shka> well, apparently 24 tons, and 29 tons of payload
[14:39:24] <shka> so TECHNICALLY it could be considered to be super heavy system
[14:39:38] <shka> but that's like measuring dick with a spine included
[14:41:30] <shka> anyway, there are multiple super heavy rockets planned, but i don't know if there is super heavy version of angara in the works
[14:42:01] <shka> even the base angara is yet to have successful launch 
[14:42:24] <shka> anyway, yes, nucleon is cool
[14:42:46] <shka> i wonder what roskosmos wants to do with it 
[14:42:57] <shka> because it is pretty interesting capability 
[14:43:20] <shka> you could use it to shuttle cargo into moon
[14:43:51] <shka> for instance
[14:47:05] <selwyn> to do what?
[14:47:22] <selwyn> robot staffed lunar base would be nice
[14:47:41] <shka> you could build pretty rad telescope on the moon
[14:47:44] <shka> for instance
[14:47:45] <selwyn> get some atomic clocks running there for a long time
[14:49:31] <selwyn> i read about a huge telescope in china that couldn't open because they couldn't find a top astronomer who was willing to live there
[14:49:38] <selwyn> it was in the middle of nowhere
[14:50:15] <selwyn> so i dread to think what the number of applicants for the moon telescope will be :D
[14:50:28] <hayley> The only issue with getting work again is that I probably won't find a job better than working for beach.
[14:50:29] <hayley> ...except for self-employment but I have no idea how to make that work.
[14:51:03] <pl> Having reasonably cheap way of shuttling cargo from LEO would make things like a moon base much easier 
[14:54:50] <shka> pl: you could also just go around and deorbit your old junk for shit a giggles
[14:55:45] <pl> That too 
[14:55:57] <shka> and Russia has a lot of junk mass in the orbit
[14:56:17] <pl> Not as much as USA though 
[14:56:43] <pl> Legacy of using low orbits 
[14:57:24] <shka> pl: by mass, it has even more
[14:59:03] <pl> The most significant stuff I can recall is parking orbit full of used up nuclear reactors 
[14:59:44] <shka> there are also spent rocket stages 
[14:59:52] <shka> which are big and heavy
[15:00:10] <shka> but anyway, you should not deorbit nuclear reactor
[15:00:24] <shka> unless you aim careful at people you don't like xD
[15:01:21] <selwyn> is there a good reason why org-mode doesn't have line wrap
[15:01:39] <shka> selwyn: emacs has line wrap, you can enable it
[15:01:43] <selwyn> sure
[15:01:48] <selwyn> but why is it disabled by default
[15:02:06] <selwyn> i suppose it messes with tables

[15:34:59] <hayley> Well, I think I did have test and test and set in the end. I was just confused as I lock for the inner TAS, rather than using an atomic instruction.
[15:36:49] <hayley> But there is another occurrence of the filter idea, where I give up on locking an object if I find out another thread installed a forwarding pointer. The GC would have to read the forwarding pointer and unlock, and we don't replace forwarding pointers, so it's a valid optimisation to not lock.
[15:41:18] <hayley> So the filter there is "did someone install a forwarding pointer" and the test is "is the lock bit clear". The former precludes having to check the latter...which is backwards to FATAS.
[15:49:25] <selwyn> fatas lol
[15:50:02] <hayley> .oO( What oh what did I abbreviate to? )
[15:50:29] <hayley> https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/fatas
[15:50:30] -ixelp- fatas - Wiktionary
[15:52:01] <hayley> But the superset idea still is important. If it doesn't hold, then you can miss opportunities for the actual locked test to succeed. e.g. you could read the mutex is locked, and only find it unlocked on a later iteration. Not that it matters. Hm.
[15:53:23] <hayley> Seems not then. /me scratches head
[15:55:05] <hayley> But a mutex acquisition is done in a loop. I test if an object is in the right generation exactly once, so getting it wrong is always an error.
[15:55:50] <hayley> So the test and set analogy is possibly poor. It's more like fast test-then-slow test, though I then do an update action. idk

[20:53:57] <selwyn> dealing with citations was probably the most time consuming part of my workflow 
[20:54:01] <selwyn> but it is really fast now
[20:54:23] <ck_> are you using an external tool for managing bibliography?
[20:54:31] <selwyn> i am using zotero
[20:54:38] <selwyn> which has good emacs integration
[20:54:51] <selwyn> and you can configure it to use webdav web storage to store articles
[20:55:17] <selwyn> í used to use mendeley but elsevier bought it and ruined it
[20:56:11] <ck_> yeah I used to use it too

[21:16:41] <ck_> honestly this stuff sounds like the job of some expert system, like lawyers use
[21:16:52] <selwyn> citation managing?
[21:16:53] <ck_> "here's my manuscript, go put the proper references in, thanks"
[21:16:55] <ck_> yes
[21:17:39] <selwyn> my experience the last couple of weeks has been that although there are lots and lots of solutions to everything you would want to do with references
[21:17:50] <selwyn> its hard to get everything to work more than 80% of the time
[21:17:55] <ck_> actually I'm surprised that plagiarism detectors haven't been beefed up to do exactly that
[21:18:00] <selwyn> its kind of overengineered
[21:18:02] <ck_> yes I understand
[21:18:26] <selwyn> the biggest problem i have is that the zotero firefox addon can't always use my university login to bypass paywalls

[21:18:48] <selwyn> i have to help it a lot
[21:19:10] <selwyn> plagiarism detectors have a mythical ability to detect 'any plagiarism'
[21:19:15] <ck_> :-)
[21:19:31] <ck_> there you go, done. see [1].
[21:19:31] <selwyn> which makes me suspect whether they are a story told to scare academics into writing properly
[21:19:43] <ck_> [1] : The Internet (a global internet, 1960)
[21:20:58] <ck_> hmm, I wouldn't be that sure about it, but my perspective might be skewed by "the -plag wikis"
[21:21:22] <ck_> if you know what I mean. There have been a couple of german politicians through that treatment

[21:21:52] <selwyn> [2]: someone told me once (can't remember when, sometime in the past)
[21:24:25] <gilberth> I believe those plagiarism won't work for us as we don't quote verbatim and in general we cannot get away by mere cut and paste. The latter makes we wonder if there any tools to detect that a passage is written by a different author based on language use.

[23:39:33] <shka> oh boy, sbcl on my pi lacks thread support :(
[23:41:07] <shka> what about ccl?
[23:41:12] <shka> will it has threads?
[23:42:28] <moon-child> https://i.redd.it/b8g4jihu4gx71.png
[23:43:10] <shka> well, i don't ask for sbcl to have threads on arm32
[23:43:22] <sm2n> shka: ecl has threads on arm32 :)
[23:43:33] <shka> yeah, i know about that
[23:43:39] <shka> i may actually load ecl 
[23:44:35] <shka> but for quick-and-dirty stuff i would use this machine for GCC compiles a little bit slow
[23:45:03] <sm2n> haha yeah
[23:45:17] <sm2n> you can use the ecl bytecode backend if you don't care about performance
[23:45:45] <sm2n> still slow to compile, but not as slow
[23:46:41] <shka> well, i just want to send requests for azure pricing
