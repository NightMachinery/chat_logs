[17:48:31] <sorinp> Hi! I have a local dev site, sorin-p.dev configured in /etc/hosts as 127.0.0.1, running on port 80 and I cannot open it in Firefox as it's redirecting to https. It works in Gnome Web. Ff is NOT configured to only accept https. I'm on Majaro Linux. Can I fix this somehow?
[17:55:48] <MaxFrames> so the other browser does not redirect?
[17:56:38] <MaxFrames> "majaro linux"?
[17:56:51] *** Joins: mefistofeles (~mefistofe@user/mefistofeles)
[17:59:10] <sorinp> MaxFrames: Manjaro Linux. Sorry, I sometimes mistype.
[17:59:43] <sorinp> MaxFrames: I only have the "Gnome Web" web browser, and it works.
[18:00:19] <sorinp> MaxFrames: However, I'd like to use my favorite browser, Firefox.
[18:00:22] <MaxFrames> do you get a warning on the other browser about https not being available?
[18:00:58] <sorinp> MaxFrames: I do not. It just opens the site on http.
[18:02:23] <MaxFrames> can you confirm you've disabled https-only mode? https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/https-only-prefs
[18:02:44] <sorinp> Yes, it is disabled.
[18:03:09] <sorinp> I also had HTTPS everywhere, which I uninstalled recently.
[18:03:52] <sorinp> On http://localhost/ there is a default site that is working correctly.
[18:06:28] <MaxFrames> all signs point to firefox not being culprit
[18:07:16] <sorinp> I suspect Firefox will not load sites declared in /etc/hosts that contain a dot in their name.
[18:08:21] <sorinp> It may be thinking it is some external site, while "localhost" is a special case.
[18:09:00] <MaxFrames> paste the /etc/hosts line
[18:11:02] <sorinp> I have an internal domain ".localdomain", resolved by my DNS server. It also resolves localhost.localdomain to 127.0.0.1 and http://localhost.localdomain/ is opening the "Secure Site Not Available" warning. But my sorin-p.dev is not opening this warning. It just goes to https.
[18:11:38] <sorinp> - /etc/hosts line: 127.0.0.1  localhost sorin-panca.dev
[18:12:11] <MaxFrames> uhm
[18:12:34] <MaxFrames> shouldn't it be "127.0.0.1 sorin-panca.dev" ?
[18:13:34] <sorinp> My dev site is an alias for localhost. You can declare any number of aliases on the same line sepparated by space.
[18:14:06] <sorinp> In any case, if I ping the name, it responds from 127.0.0.1.
[18:14:07] <MaxFrames> but it's redundant in this case isn't it
[18:14:54] <sorinp> MaxFrames: when you want multiple vhosts for the same IP address, it is not. The name of the site is selecting the vhost on the server.
[18:16:48] <MaxFrames> but I think therein lies the problem. have you ever had another vhost aliased from localhost to [whatever] and working both with localhost and [whatever]? considering localhost will always resolve to 127.0.0.1
[18:17:22] <MaxFrames> wouldn't hurt to try

[18:20:17] <sorinp> I have 2 sites hosted: one is sorin-panca.dev (now that I leaked its full name, like the address bar is Firefox often does to google if you are not careful), and the other is the default vhost.
[18:20:52] <sorinp> I created a new alias: foo-bar.baz and I'm getting the same warning as for localhost.
[18:21:15] <sorinp> 127.0.0.1  localhost sorin-panca.dev foo-bar.baz

[18:33:18] <MaxFrames> gotcha
[18:33:26] <MaxFrames> can't use .dev apparently
[18:33:46] <MaxFrames> .dev is a TLD and it enforces SSL
[18:34:03] <MaxFrames> https://ma.ttias.be/chrome-force-dev-domains-https-via-preloaded-hsts/
[18:34:18] <MaxFrames> you'll have to choose another TLD for your alias

[18:35:14] <sorinp> Hmmm...
[18:35:34] <sorinp> They must be joking!

[18:42:21] <sorinp> But why is Firefox preloading HSTS, though? Is this a requirement for some agreement with Google?
[18:42:42] <sorinp> At least Gnome Web is not doing it.
