[00:23:19] <Robomot> 7.62√ó54mmR - Wikipedia (The 7.62√ó54mmR is a rimmed rifle cartridge developed by the Russian Empire and introduced as a service cartridge in 1891.

[00:24:01] <Ralith> did you mean deprecation? inflation causes the nominal value of real assets to increase
[00:24:30] <Ralith> depreciation, rather
[00:24:34] <ggreer> I mean I bought my car for $65k back in 2020 and I can sell it for $65k today
[00:24:42] <ggreer> but due to inflation, it's not the same amount of wealth
[00:25:58] <ggreer> the rimmed cartridge really hurts certain small arms designs but the cost of switching is too great. I guess the russians and ex-soviet countries will be stuck on it for decades to come
[00:29:24] <Ralith> if you can sell a two year old used car for the same nominal value as when it was brand new, that's some pretty modest deprecation!

[05:08:03] <saturn2> it's entirely possible for a place to have a high cost of living even if food is free
[05:12:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Yeah, but there's a (probably mostly unconscious/unintentional) motte-and-bailey that happens
[05:12:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Technically, you are 100% correct, and "cost of living" refers to *total* cost, i.e. how much money you have to spend overall to live here
[05:13:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> But what many people erroneously conclude is "everything is expensive in NYC"
[05:14:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which is not true. The actual fact of the matter is "NYC has high rents" (or, if you like, "high real estate prices" more broadly)
[05:14:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> If you want to aggregate/summarize that as "NYC has a high cost of living", you will of course be, as I said, technically correct, and if you make use of this fact (in calculations/decisions/etc.) in full understanding of what it means, great, no problems
[05:15:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> But the breakdown is "high rent prices, many other things not expensive at all and indeed *much* cheaper than many other places with much lower rents"
[05:16:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Those are the component facts of the "high cost of living" aggregate fact
[05:17:41] <saturn2> i see
[05:18:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> (This is important both because "high rent prices" itself breaks down into e.g. a geographic distribution of housing prices, correlations with geographic distributions of other important demographic and behavioral and cultural factors, etc., *and* because it's entirely possible to find opportunities to optimize your rent expenditures specifically, where you likely will have no such opportunities to optimize "cost of living" as
[05:18:15] <Obormot\Arcturus>  a whole)

[05:51:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's not unsanitary
[05:52:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> And most places that are worth going to make the pizza in front of you
[05:52:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> My pizzeria of choice, down the block from me, is a tiny hole in the wall place; there's literally no room for the pizza to be made *not* in front of you
[05:53:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's nowhere in the place that could possibly be not in front of anyone inside

[08:29:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> I think also true (but not as much of course) in international relations
[08:29:54] <quanticle> More so in international relations than epidemiology?
[08:30:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe?
[08:30:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Epidemiology seems to have revealed itself as an entire field of clowns
[08:31:24] <quanticle> Perhaps. Perhaps we need to relegate epidemiology to the same tier as bioethics.

[11:15:26] <kuudes> the situation with sanctions is not that much of sanctions anymore, but of private party actions
[11:15:48] <kuudes> even if putin reverses course fully, it seems likely it will take a long time before western companies dare to come back
[11:16:28] <kuudes> but these sanctions are not aimed at putin changing course. these sanctions are aimed to remove putin's machinery the ability to work

[12:18:10] <kuudes> the former says only box "people don't die and suffer && Russia does not win" is considered, the latter says only the box "Russia does not win" is considered, but there is preference toward the side where less people die
[12:18:22] <quanticle> The risk premiums are high, but on the other hand, you have a population that has been cut off from Western goods for several years. It's like Iran, or Argentina after one of its periodic defaults and economic crises.
[12:18:32] <kuudes> ie Zvi is willing to let people die, as long as Russia does not win. he just prefers to minimize that dying
[12:18:57] <kuudes> they have no money
[12:19:18] <saturn2> i don't think he would accept unlimited dying to stop russia from winning
[12:19:46] <kuudes> that is a third definition, saturn2
[12:20:23] <kuudes> preference for less death != acceptance of no death != nonacceptance of unlimited death
[12:20:51] <kuudes> he said #1, not #2 or #3
[12:21:35] <kuudes> #2 and #3 are projections, things the sayer wishes he said
[12:22:08] <kuudes> "some russians may die, and that is acceptable as long as russia does not win" is more equivalent to what he said
[12:23:01] <quanticle> No, they have money. At least, there will be some stratum of society that will have enough money to appreciate Coca Cola.
[12:23:12] <kuudes> quanticle, over here companies have fled russia because of local (finnish) people boycotting them, not because government telling them to leave
[12:23:34] <saturn2> they are just two separate preferences which are in contradiction so some tradeoff is required. he doesn't say what tradeoff he would make
[12:24:04] <kuudes> saturn2, there is different definitiveness in what he says of the preferences
[12:24:16] <quanticle> Yes. Same here. However, in my estimation, the effect of consumer boycotts will be far less long-lived than the effects of sanctions. If sanctions are lifted, I would not expect much consumer reaction to companies re-entering Russia.
[12:24:22] <kuudes> "prefer people doing better" "do not want Russia to win"

[12:25:36] <quanticle> If, four or five years hence, Apple quietly reopens its Apple Store in Moscow, do you think there will be another outcry that forces Apple to leave?

[12:26:30] <kuudes> sanctions don't forbid apple from operating in russia, do they?
[12:26:58] <kuudes> they just make it very hard to do so; currency can't be exchanged and goods can't be imported to russia etc
[12:27:11] <saturn2> it seems like you are projecting your own opinions onto zvi
[12:27:47] <kuudes> that is possible, but it seems to me this is a clear logical thing he said
[12:28:04] <kuudes> and I have not misquoted him, have I?
[12:28:39] <kuudes> I am accusing you guys of being insufficiently internet-autist in this though, I guess
[12:28:54] <saturn2> what he said has a straightforward meaning that does not appear to be erroneous and is different from your rephrasing
[12:29:30] <quanticle> I'm not sure. I don't think there is any direct restriction on Apple operating in Russia. My impression is that a combination of consumer outcry caused by the salience of the Ukraine crisis in the media and disruption to Russia's ability to access dollars has caused Apple to cease selling to Russia. The latter is a consequence of sanctions. But at some point in the future, if the US should
[12:29:32] <quanticle> decide to formally acknowledge whatever political situation Ukraine has ended up in and lift sanctions, I would expect Apple to be able to resume business with little or no reputational harm.

[12:31:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Good to hear
[12:31:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> How's he doing
[12:32:21] <kuudes> I asked
[12:32:42] <kuudes> quanticle, this is different. putin didn't threaten Usa and nato with nuclear annihilation in 2008 and 2014
[12:33:02] <kuudes> putin didn't launch ballistic missiles in 2008 and 2014
[12:34:00] <kuudes> putin didn't use russia's nuclear delivery capability in 2008 and 2014
[12:34:49] <kuudes> that is different to current.
[12:35:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Has Putin done... any of those things? In 2022?
[12:35:14] <quanticle> He has not
[12:35:15] <kuudes> yes
[12:35:24] <kuudes> he has launched kalibrs and iskanders to ukraine
[12:35:44] <kuudes> which are the russia's means of delivery of tactical nukes
[12:35:56] <quanticle> So? The US launches nuclear capable cruise missiles all the time at all sorts of people
[12:36:08] <kuudes> there has been talks that he has used strategic bombers against ukraine, but I don't recall confirmation
[12:36:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Uhh
[12:36:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> So your reasoning is
[12:36:28] <quanticle> And, once again, the B1 and the B2 are *both* nuclear capable delivery platforms
[12:36:30] <kuudes> usa does not threaten those people with tactical nukes
[12:36:35] <quanticle> Has Putin?
[12:36:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Russia used missiles of the same sort as the missiles they use for nukes
[12:36:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> But the missiles Russia used did not contain nukes
[12:36:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> But somehow
[12:36:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is ... important? Relevant? Meaningful? At all?

[12:38:31] <quanticle> The New York Times is hardly considered a reliable or unbiased news source. Putin did not declare a nuclear "alert". Putin manned the nuclear launch stations. Putin moved his nuclear forces to the same status that the US keeps its nuclear forces at on a regular and routine basis. This is somehow construed as an "escalation"

[12:39:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> We have to "decipher" Putin's comments to detect nuclear threats in them now, eh
[12:40:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> But yeah, what quanticle said. The U.S. does this stuff all the time
[12:40:50] <kuudes> quanticle, well lets take the other side of the aisle then https://www.foxnews.com/politics/russia-nuclear-threat-increasing-ukraine-invasion
[12:40:51] <Robomot> Russia-Ukraine war: Russian nuclear threat 'likely increasing,' US intel officials say | Fox News (U.S. intelligence officials said Tuesday that the nuclear threat from Russia is likely "increasing" as the invasion of Ukraine continues for a second week.)
[12:40:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> And the missiles thing is just laughable
[12:41:01] <quanticle> The first two sentences are amazing:
[12:41:03] <quanticle> "Now that Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his country‚Äôs nuclear forces on high alert for the first time since the end of the Cold War, this is a time for vigilance. No signs yet suggest the bulk of Russian nuclear forces actually are on high alert as part of Moscow‚Äôs 'special regime of combat duty.'"
[12:41:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> What aisle is this the other side of, exactly
[12:41:17] <kuudes> us senate
[12:41:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> From what
[12:41:37] <kuudes> you are being willfully obtuse, as you say
[12:42:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> No, I am trying to point out that Fox and NYT are in fact on the same side of any relevant "aisle" in this situation
[12:42:37] <kuudes> ok. there is no nuclear threat. please allow nato to air police ukraine then?
[12:43:02] <quanticle> Also, that Atlantic Council link directly contradicts your assertion that Putin didn't threaten nuclear escalation in the past:
[12:43:04] <quanticle> "This level of nuclear posturing has been visible in the past. During the 2014 invasion and illegal annexation of Crimea, Putin bragged that he wanted to remind Russians (and, by extension, the West) that 'Russia is one of the leading nuclear powers,' and 'it‚Äôs best not to mess with us.' Although he never raised the nuclear alert, he later said he‚Äôd considered doing so."
[12:43:06] <quanticle> So even the Atlantic Council admits that Russia's nuclear posturing is commensurate with their nuclear posturing during the 2014 invasion.
[12:43:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: ... wait a minute, your Fox link doesn't even say that Putin threatened nuclear war
[12:43:40] <kuudes> saturn2, is this discussion meaningful? it feels to me Obormot\Arcturus and quanticle are being playing stupid

[12:48:37] <kuudes> and now also by facebook's preferences
[12:48:41] <kuudes> so screw you
[12:48:44] <quanticle> And by facebook laws t... lmao
[12:49:04] <kuudes> fully legal sepa transactions to germany's central bank
[12:49:13] <kuudes> which fund killing russian soldiers
[12:49:25] <kuudes> I presume I might even be able to tax deduct them
[12:49:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> You know that we're allowed to have channel rules against things that are legal, right
[12:50:09] <kuudes> sure. but we have no rule for being for nato
[12:50:31] <kuudes> and you are not an op
[12:50:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Your behavior right now is utterly deranged tbh
[12:50:47] <kuudes> no, you
[12:51:30] <saturn2> yeah, i think ukraine talk should be limited to #lw-politics from now on
[12:51:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> How representative do you think your views are of Finnish people in general?
[12:51:35] <kuudes> thanks saturn2
[12:51:39] <quanticle> I mean, I will note that Putin *did* one escalatory act, nuclear-wise, but it was prior to the invasion. He rescheduled the annual alert exercise that the Russian nuclear forces have to early February, right before the invasion started. That was interpreted by many, including myself, as a signal from Putin to Western militaries that the Russian nuclear forces would be ready and fully on guard
[12:51:41] <quanticle> against any escalatory acts from the West.
[12:51:45] <kuudes> quanticle, saturn2 ruled
[12:51:49] <quanticle> Oh
[12:51:51] <quanticle> Okay
[12:51:54] <quanticle> Didn't see it
[12:52:36] <kuudes> saturn2, I recommend making it for the general warlike situation of nato-putin, because otherwise you will have plenty of greyzone thing
[12:52:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Uh no
[12:53:00] <quanticle> Eh, you have a truck sized hole in the form of gwern anyway
[12:53:10] <kuudes> yes, but this is gwern's channel
[12:53:14] <kuudes> so he may do whatever
[12:53:20] <saturn2> well, gwern is on vacation
[12:53:42] <quanticle> Maybe we should do our best to help Putin conquer Ukraine and settle this whole matter before gwern gets back!

[12:55:00] <quanticle> Okay, geez
[12:55:27] <kuudes> I will keep titfortatting in the situation and will obey the rules
[12:56:17] <PapuaHardyNet> what did obormot do exactly? I don't see him being offensive in any way to you or to finns
[12:56:54] <kuudes> PapuaHardyNet, I don't think that is fruitful to converse now here

[12:57:50] <PapuaHardyNet> just wanted to make you understand: from my perspective it was quite strange
[12:57:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: I didn't do anything, kuudes is just insane
[12:58:10] <kuudes> you are insane
[12:58:18] <quanticle> oh my god, both of you
[12:58:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: He was always kind of off but this latest geopolitical business broke his brain for good
[12:58:25] <saturn2> it is an upsetting topic, and we made #lw-politics to discuss things it is hard to stay rational about
[12:58:39] <kuudes> Obormot\Arcturus just dislikes wishing death to some russians
[12:58:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: See?
[12:59:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Poor guy's gone 'round the bend
[12:59:15] <kuudes> Obormot\Arcturus was always somehow lacking a bit
[12:59:33] <saturn2> enough of that
[12:59:40] <kuudes> ok
[13:00:12] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm all for not wishing death to people. Obormot doesn't need to signal that he is for your side. anyway, end of conversation
[13:00:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Certainly "not wishing death to people" is a reasonable rule, for reasonable people. I endorse it
[13:01:08] <kuudes> wishing death to enemy soldiers is clearly reasonable
[13:01:27] <saturn2> we all have to wish death to people sometimes, unless we are jainists or something
[13:01:29] <PlanckWalk> I don't mind wishing a peaceful death to those who would welcome it.
[13:01:40] <PlanckWalk> But anyone else?  Not really.

[13:01:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: It's best to minimize it. Certainly not to revel in it

[13:02:38] <PlanckWalk> Yes, I'm in Australia

[13:03:31] <kuudes> you are not having to plan to house 1/10 more population suddenly
[13:03:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> lol
[13:03:42] <kuudes> PlanckWalk, you started it, and this is not about ukraine
[13:03:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> You know what the most amazing thing about so many people's response to this has been?
[13:04:00] <kuudes> this is about nato-putin
[13:04:21] <saturn2> i need to start coming up with gwernpastes i guess
[13:04:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> That so many folks are behaving like this is *the first time there has ever been any war anywhere*
[13:04:22] <kuudes> so lets talk it here or there, either is fine. I am fine with banning this general topic from main
[13:04:40] <capisce> quanticle: the Ukraine invasion is on a whole other scale compared to Crimea, so the harsher reactions don't seem that surprising
[13:04:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> We're having a whole drama about it on DSL, too
[13:04:58] <kuudes> capisce, that has been delegated to #lw-politics
[13:05:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> Some guy posted some shit like "if you ever say that to my face you'll regret it" or w/e, you know, standard internet tough guy nonsense
[13:05:16] <kuudes> saturn2, but yes, I would like Obormot\Arcturus told to shut about this
[13:05:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> There was predictably an uproar about it
[13:05:40] <kuudes> he is willfully trying to hurt me; I will willfully try to hurt him
[13:05:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> He got a 1-day ban or w/e
[13:06:16] <kuudes> I will try to not to escalate, but I will keep going titfortat
[13:06:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: This is all in your head, man. Nobody's "willfully trying to hurt" you, it's just you
[13:06:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, so then one of the moderators was like
[13:06:47] <kuudes> #lesswrong has taught me well in that quokkaism is bad
[13:06:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> "But guys, it's understandable, isn't it? He lives in *Poland*! That's, like ... right next to all the stuff..."
[13:06:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> And I was like
[13:07:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is this the first time anyone has had any personal stake in anything, anywhere?
[13:07:27] <kuudes> I hope any relatives you have in russian military die horribly, Obormot\Arcturus
[13:07:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> First war? First danger?
[13:07:53] <kuudes> Obormot\Arcturus, yes
[13:08:06] <kuudes> there has not been hot war threatening west europe since 1990
[13:08:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: You're gonna look back at these comments in some time and feel incredible shame, that's all I gotta say
[13:08:18] <kuudes> you could stop
[13:08:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, of course it's silly
[13:09:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> Lots of people have relatives, or even themselves, threatened by war or violence *all the time*, and *somehow* manage not to threaten to punch people on the internet, or whatever
[13:09:25] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: he has already agreed to drop the topic
[13:09:26] <kuudes> I hope the assault rifles finland has shipped kill a lot of russian military persons
[13:09:36] <synthmeat> isn't ob like russian? :D
[13:09:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Do you call this dropping the topic
[13:09:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> synthmeat: Yes, he's doing it on purpose
[13:09:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> synthmeat: Just ignore
[13:09:55] <kuudes> synthmeat, yes he is
[13:10:05] <kuudes> that is why he feels bad on people killing russian military
[13:10:26] <kuudes> or causing putin's russia economic distress
[13:10:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Dude you have no idea how I feel about the Russian military, or people killing them
[13:11:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Back to the DSL thing... the example I gave was Israel/Palestine
[13:11:46] <PapuaHardyNet> hey why tf is Tel aviv so rich if israel is so insular?
[13:11:48] <kuudes> some 10 years ago I would have just cried myself because Obormot\Arcturus is bullying me, but indeed #lesswrong has taught me that that is not the correct response, but to dish out the same back
[13:12:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: In fact most of Israel is quite well off
[13:12:04] <PlanckWalk> Obormot is not bullying you.
[13:12:04] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: Oh man, I haven't been on DSL for like four days, and at this point, I'm kind of afraid to open the threads on the current situation that I posted in.
[13:12:16] <PapuaHardyNet> b/c jews?
[13:12:41] <kuudes> PlanckWalk, he is not? sure does seem to ignore my signalling that this feels bad on personal level
[13:12:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: I mean, you can of course give that sort of answer, and it's true in a broad statistical sense, but not very informative or interesting
[13:12:55] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm being serious I genuinely don't understand how Israel became a powerhouse.
[13:13:01] <kuudes> and willfully continues the topic unlike a compassionate human being
[13:13:27] <kuudes> of course Obormot\Arcturus has some mental problems as he has said before
[13:13:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Uhh what
[13:13:40] <saturn2> israel/palestine is also a banned topic and has been for years

[13:24:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: Anyway to answer your question, it's complicated, but it's some combination of "strong investment in infrastructure", "initial population consisted of true believers who were extremely dedicated to a unified cause", "importing many people with useful technical/scientific/business/etc. skills", "foreign aid from the U.S.", and "unity imposed by external existential threats"
[13:25:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: (Many more people are aware of the latter four things than are aware of the first one, by the way)
[13:25:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> (But it's very important!)
[13:25:32] <quanticle> "Make the desert bloom"
[13:25:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Right
[13:25:45] <PapuaHardyNet> makes a lot of sense. coordination failures are the biggest problems we have.
[13:26:19] <quanticle> I remember a while ago, there were some Israeli advisors who came to India to advise (obviously) the Indian government about how to do irrigation more efficiently
[13:26:29] <quanticle> Dunno what happened to that initiative, but knowing India...
[13:26:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like - and this is a striking example - if you go to Israel, you will see *way* more greenery in the cities/towns than you would expect given the climate. And if you look closely at the trees/shrubs/bushes lining the streets, you will see they literally have
[13:26:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Individual (!) irrigation tubing
[13:26:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Running to every single plant
[13:27:12] <quanticle> Yeah, drip irrigation is incredible. I helped my parents set up a system for my mom's vegetable patch.
[13:27:43] <quanticle> It was a pain, but the tomatos were worth it??
[13:28:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Meanwhile, re: importing people with useful skills - note that Israel actually had several distinct waves of this
[13:29:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> One was after WW2 (for rather obvious reasons)
[13:29:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Another was around the fall of the USSR
[13:29:45] <PapuaHardyNet> they only imported jews though, right?
[13:29:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Before and after, note. Started around the period of relaxation of emigration restrictions in the 70s, continued on through the 90s)
[13:29:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, due to the Right of Return
[13:31:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> So e.g. one of my mother's good friends, he went to Israel with his family (they left Russia at almost the exact same time we did, in fact); he's a physicist, works on high-end ... signals... radio... something, hell, I don't entirely understand his field even, but whatever it is, he's one of the leading names in it
[13:31:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Soviet-educated, Soviet-trained, and Israel got his expertise and knowledge etc. ready-made
[13:31:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Lots more like him

In the Law of Return, the State of Israel gave effect to the Zionist ‚Ä¶)
[13:37:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: Also the kibbutz system was (and is, to some extent) an important factor in Israel's ability to produce a lot of goods that you wouldn't necessarily expect them to be able to do efficiently
[13:38:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> "In 2010, there were 270 kibbutzim in Israel with population of 126,000.[4] Their factories and farms account for 9% of Israel's industrial output, worth US$8 billion, and 40% of its agricultural output, worth over $1.7 billion.[5] Some kibbutzim had also developed substantial high-tech and military industries. For example, in 2010, Kibbutz Sasa, containing some 200 members, generated $850 million in annual revenue from its
[13:38:02] <Obormot\Arcturus>  military-plastics industry.[6]"
[13:38:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> (This is out of a total population of like 9 million)
[13:40:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> And that's after a substantial decline of kibbutzim! They used to be even more important

[19:38:13] <capisce> if it contains +m it's moderated and only people with voice can speak

[19:38:46] <shawwwn> Mods can mute individual people. It‚Äôs the way that bans happen here

[19:39:46] <shawwwn> I think Robomot has actual +v
[19:41:02] <shawwwn> Well, I think I baited myself into rejoining lesswrong. I asked him whether logos was still banned, and in true gwern fashion he said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs banned, no‚Äù
[19:41:41] <shawwwn> So I showed up armed with https://youtu.be/91tImTdOgV4

[19:42:06] <gwern> my understanding was that we usually clear the banlist after a while except for nasty troll/spammers (GNAA level), and for logos it's more like "you've had a very long time out and if you still want to come back and think you can behave yourself, well..."
[19:42:10] <shawwwn> Then just before posting it, I realize that logos was muted, not banned
[19:42:56] <shawwwn> Yes, that seems like a reasonable timeout period
[19:43:15] <shawwwn> and by reasonable I mean Saturn is literally Stalin

[19:59:05] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, but who is Ed
[19:59:13] <shawwwn> At one point he started asking about Tensorfork, and then me in relation to gwern. Like ‚Äòso what kind of neat things are you two supervillains up to?‚Äô
[19:59:33] <shawwwn> I had to be like well, we chat once in awhile on Twitter
[20:00:02] <shawwwn> He was like really? ‚ÄúYou two were joined at the hip at one point‚Äù
[20:00:24] <shawwwn> I got sad but hid it, and just brushed off the question as well, life and work and stuff

[20:08:05] <gwern> the Clippy on my shoulder keeps telling me that those strings are only tying me down
[20:08:09] <kuudes> surely logos01 could agree that some singular person is the one who can signal him to cease a current topic?
[20:08:17] <shawwwn> Can you get over your deep seated feeling of ‚Äúhe‚Äôs just manipulating me‚Äù and realize that a friend incapable of lifting a finger is no friend?

[20:12:11] <gwern> ...proctored tests. one australian guy was unsure if he'd be allowed back into australia because australia might require a covid test in the previous 24 hours, and his flights were going to take *20*+ hours, and he took the test a few hours before he left, so...) diligent-seeming but not imaginative or super into design. I spent a lot of it showing him gwern.net in dark mode on my phone and...
[20:12:17] <gwern> ...how slick mobile is: going through the tag-directories, backlinks, similar links, recursive popins, cross-page popins, live popins, collapses, etc etc. he was pretty impressed. I don't think he has spent much time really *looking* at gwern.net with a web dev eye. so we might see some more features be copied in the future.
[20:12:38] <feep> at the time I was like "ah logos01 got banned because of so and so dynamics" and saturn2 I think was like "actually that's not at all the reason"
[20:12:55] <feep> now, I still think he's wrong, but it's disconfirming evidence
[20:15:30] <gwern> Obormot\Gaia: I also killed a decent amount of time just looking through gwern.net and have a lot of tweaks to make. the biggest problem I noticed is that it seems like (in Firefox but not chrome?) that a lot of links are missing underlines? very weird. haven't looked into it yet

[21:16:13] <RiversHaveWings> It seems to understand what Clippy is from everyone calling it that on the internet

[21:16:23] <RiversHaveWings> It has the concept, it's just *really bad*
[21:16:49] <RiversHaveWings> It is in fact doing less well w/ "Clippit".

[22:13:16] <adiabatic> he 'tismed one time too many for the rest of us
[22:13:24] <feep> I'm choosing to believe it is not the explicitly stated version, which is that he was wrong at length about air conditioning

[22:13:48] <feep> how an air conditioner works, I think
[22:13:49] <adiabatic> that's what he 'tismed about
