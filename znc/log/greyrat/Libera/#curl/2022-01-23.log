[15:18:01] <DukeDrake> hi
[15:18:29] <DukeDrake> can I ask questions on curl-oddities here?
[15:25:53] <quinq> sure
[15:26:23] <quinq> Doesn't mean you'll necessary get an answer you want though ^^
[15:28:49] <DukeDrake> I curl https://www.baua.de with CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION set to true. I receive a 301 to https://www.BAuA.de/, which then returns a 404. 
[15:30:14] <DukeDrake> After successfully checking ~50some domains, this is the first domain I ran into this error. Can anyone explain the behavior?
[15:30:40] <DukeDrake> (the domain is of course online and wget and browser work fine)
[15:31:08] *** Quits: Jaxx (~Jaxx@user/jaxx) (Quit: Leaving)
[15:34:06] <quinq> I get a 302, not 301 here
[15:34:19] <quinq> It works with the curl tool
[15:34:33] <quinq> Maybe you're using an older libcurl with a now fixed bug?
[15:34:55] <quinq> HTTP/1.1 302 Found
[15:34:58] <quinq> Location: https://www.baua.de/DE/Home/Home_node.html
[15:35:24] <quinq> Or you're having a dns resolving to a broken host for this url
[15:35:43] <quinq> Here: www.baua.de has address 213.95.148.245
[15:36:31] <quinq> Also, it's possible that you have a bug in your code
[15:44:04] <DukeDrake> I found that if I set CURLOPT_USERAGENT, it works. However, it's odd that it would not work without the user-agent set?
[15:45:40] <quinq> So that would be a misconfigured httpd
[15:46:39] <quinq> $ curl -LI -A '' -s https://www.baua.de
[15:46:39] <quinq> HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
[15:46:45] <quinq> I don't even get a redirection :D
[15:56:37] *** Joins: keypusher (keypusher@user/keypusher)
[16:12:27] <DukeDrake> wow =)
[16:13:51] <DukeDrake> I still don't understand how the 404 gets "produced"? How bad can you misconfigure a httpd that it answers with a 404 in that case ... ?

[16:26:16] <icing> DukeDrake: must be intentional to deny non-browsers easy access. Some security people misguidedly think this is safer.
[16:28:54] <Piru> DukeDrake: it's just the server being weird
[16:31:34] <Piru> behavioural changes based on user-agent are a thing. makes little sense to me, but it does happen sometimes. some sites for example block curl and wget UA
[16:54:46] <quinq> icing, but that's still a strange decision that curl user-agent isn't non-browser ^^
[16:55:10] <icing> quinq: I agree!
[16:56:41] <quinq> Maybe that's not a decision at all, they might just have installed a “security framework”
