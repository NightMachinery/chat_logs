[02:39:04] <Guest17> hello, I just installed the hop plugin but I'm confused about their recommended keybindings because two of them have a blank mode in the binding. For example:
[02:39:26] <Guest17> vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('', 't', "<cmd>lua require'hop'.hint_char1({ direction = require'hop.hint'.HintDirection.AFTER_CURSOR, current_line_only = true })<cr>", {})
[02:39:26] <Guest17> vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('', 'T', "<cmd>lua require'hop'.hint_char1({ direction = require'hop.hint'.HintDirection.BEFORE_CURSOR, current_line_only = true })<cr>", {})
[02:39:56] <Guest17> Compare that to this, where the mode is normal:
[02:39:58] <Guest17> vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', 'f', "<cmd>lua require'hop'.hint_char1({ direction = require'hop.hint'.HintDirection.AFTER_CURSOR, current_line_only = true })<cr>", {})
[02:40:22] <Guest17> Here's a link to github for the section of readme I'm talking about
[02:40:30] <Guest17> https://github.com/phaazon/hop.nvim#keybindings
[02:41:53] <gpanders> Guest17: what is your question exactly?
[02:42:11] <Guest17> For the mappings where the mode is blank, what exactly is it mapping?
[02:42:19] <Guest17> What is it doing?

[02:43:22] <gpanders> have you read `:h nvim_set_keymap()`?
[02:43:59] <Guest17> yes
[02:44:05] <Guest17> I've also read :h mode()
[02:44:15] <Guest17> neither mention anything about mode being blank that I saw
[02:45:00] <gpanders> In `:h nvim_set_keymap()`, in the "Parameters:" section, next to `{mode}`, it says... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/1606627a8dc81f4096e0f8df4d34f312068254ec)
[02:45:45] <gpanders> so an empty string is the same as using `:map`, i.e. it is equivalent to using modes `nvo`

[06:38:08] <b0o> DonovanJones[m]: this isn't exactly a style guide but it does have some style tips: https://github.com/nanotee/nvim-lua-guide

[10:28:28] <mjlbach[m]> the null-ls warning is unavoidable, unless you force clangd to run in utf-16 mode
[10:28:51] <mjlbach[m]> it basically means, we are sending the wrong range request to one of the servers attached to the buffer, so expect junk back
[10:29:14] <mjlbach[m]> we don't support mixed offset encodings yet
[10:29:55] <wbthomason[m]> Yeah, I figured. I just wanted to temporarily disable the warning since it blocks editing

[10:34:15] <wbthomason[m]> True. But that takes more effort than forcing clangd to use utf-16, so it's probably best to just do that, for now
[10:34:16] <AryaBackup[m]> <AryaBackup[m]> "i want my init.lua to be..." <- is this even possible?
[10:34:56] <wbthomason[m]> Or disable null-ls for C++, etc
[10:38:03] <mjlbach[m]> What are you using null-ls for c++? 
[10:38:14] <mjlbach[m]> cppcheck?
[10:39:29] <wbthomason[m]> clang-format (which I know clangd can offer too; I was trying to unify my formatting to be through null-ls wherever possible because it can also do whitespace cleanup)
[10:40:04] <wbthomason[m]> (and it's easier to tell formatting to default to null-ls and avoid the "which server would you like to format with?" prompt that way)
[10:41:47] <wbthomason[m]> s/offer/provide/
[10:43:08] <mjlbach[m]> If you only have one server attached to a buffer, it will default to that
[10:43:52] <wbthomason[m]> Yeah - I want the whitespace cleanup formatter from null-ls in most contexts, though
[10:44:07] <wbthomason[m]> It's a pretty minor issue; I'll work around it one way or the other
[10:46:36] <mjlbach[m]> I don't know why null-ls doesn't just completely split from LSP integration at this point haha. 99% of the time I see people wanting to "disable" all other language servers for formatting when null-ls could just expose a function that only calls the null-ls formatting interface

[10:53:47] <mjlbach[m]> there's no reason to go through the LSP protocol for formatting alone

[13:07:49] <kylo252[m]> there are a few caveats that you might need to clear the cache of a whole bunch of related modules, but it should work for simple cases
[13:08:40] <Neur1nNeur1n[m]> So I just need to pass the name of the module into this function?
[13:11:27] <kylo252[m]> it depends on what you're trying to debug, but mostly yes. the way that I like to make most of use of this is an idea I got from tj, by using a `scratch` module...

[13:12:39] <kylo252[m]> then I usually copy whatever I'm debugging into that scratch file and add then I'm free to print or inspect however I want
[13:15:15] <kylo252[m]> if you're debugging an entire plugin, then I really don't think that normal print statements are the way to go imo, instead use a logger, you can wrap plenary.log to do that which gives you access to the console and a logfile if you want

[17:05:31] <zenof> okay, now, should I use the structure described here https://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/chapters/42.html  under .config/nvim/ and what used to go into .vim/bundle/ now goes to .local/share/nvim/site/ ? I am really confused...

[17:13:56] <zenof> oh, and by the way, when I open nvim with an empty buffer only and do ':h something' , focus the empty buffer's split, and do ':q', why does nvim exit both splits, where as when I manually do a ':split' and ':q' the other splits buffer and thus nvim stays open? 
[17:15:46] <zenof> what I really would like to do is close the split, so only the help window keeps open
[17:18:39] <ravndal> regarding bundle/site: you can use ~/.local/share/nvim/site however you like, but what you propose could be a useful way to do things to have a clean separation between your own and other people's configuration (read: plugins)

[17:26:46] <zenof> ravndal:  ".. to have a clean separation between your own and other people's configuration.." exactly what I thought of.
[17:28:00] <arch-angel> do ya'll like save sessions and restore it?
[17:28:20] <arch-angel> I find it really inconvinient to have to open files every time i close neovim
[17:30:02] <zenof> arch-angel: I do like the idea. but did set up anything to do so yet. is there a canonical way to ?
[17:30:13] <zenof> * but I didn't...
[17:30:32] <arch-angel> i don't know any, that's why I'm asking
[17:31:45] <ravndal> `:mksession` exists
[17:32:20] <ravndal> though personally I much prefer tpope's vim-obsession combined with vim-prosession for automagic session management on a per working directory basis
[17:32:49] <ravndal> it's quite nice
[17:33:11] <vigoux[m]> obsession is definitely nice
[17:33:54] <arch-angel> :mksession... does neovim have something like emacs where I can add hooks so that when neovim quits it'll call :mksession?
[17:34:34] <vigoux[m]> That's quite exactly what `obsession` does
[17:34:48] <ham5urg> If I do a :split or :vsplit some_file.txt, some_file.txt is appearing at the previous space and the already_opened_file.txt is 'moving' to the newly used space. Can I switch that?
[17:35:01] <vigoux[m]> Otherwise, you should look into `autocmds` and especially `VimLeave`
[17:36:43] <zenof> ham5urg, I guess what you are looking for is something like "set splitright" and "set splitbelow"?

[17:47:45] <eoli3n> i use an vimplug plugin which literrally breaks my balls here time i reinstall it

[17:48:23] <eoli3n> how do I run this, where ?
[17:48:44] <vigoux[m]> What plugin manager do you use ?
[17:49:01] <vigoux[m]> Most of the time, the plugin managers let you run a command on update, at the root of the project

[17:51:21] <eoli3n> FreeBSD, don't worry i will figure it out now

[20:35:15] <d1rewolf> neovim ships with lua 5.1, while the latest macOS lua version via homebrew is 5.4. This causes issues when trying to use certain libraries like luasocket in my neovim config. Is it possible to use a later version of lua with neovim? Would it require a recompile?
[20:35:33] <clason[m]> No
[20:35:46] <clason[m]> Neovim ships with LuaJIT, which is Lua 5.1 compatible
[20:36:15] <clason[m]> newer versions of Lua are not upgrade paths but different language (dialects); more like Python2 vs. Python3
[20:36:18] <mjlbach[m]> d1rewolf: it will also be a downgrade

[20:43:44] <d1rewolf> how can one use luarocks with the embedded nvim lua? is there a tutorial somewhere?
[20:43:48] <clason[m]> so it's available for Lua 5.1 in Neovim
[20:43:54] <clason[m]> as I said, use packer
[20:43:59] <d1rewolf> ok, let me look into that. I'm very new to packer and working on an example config
[20:44:06] <clason[m]> that will install it for you
[20:44:19] <clason[m]> start simple :)
[20:46:41] <d1rewolf> clason[m]: but...mobdebug is a lua module while packer installs .nvim plugins, right?
[20:46:55] <clason[m]> no, packer can also install luarocks
[20:47:10] <clason[m]> it's right there in the README ;)
[20:47:12] <mjlbach[m]> the lua interpreter is embedded into neovim
[20:47:18] <mjlbach[m]> it's not using your system lua interpreter
[20:47:37] <d1rewolf> clason[m]: ah...k. sorry about that. thanks for the pointer
[20:47:45] <clason[m]> no worries
[20:47:47] <d1rewolf> mjlbach[m]: yep... I understand

[20:57:50] <wbthomason[m]> I think not - that's an oversight we should correct
[20:58:29] <d1rewolf> wbthomason[m]: is it possible to call startup twice with two different forms?
[20:58:34] <wbthomason[m]> Luarocks integration was added after all the different plugin spec formats, and the table format is relatively infrequently used (modulo clason I don't know anybody who uses that form)

[21:40:29] <d1rewolf> wbthomason[m]: unfortunately my config is broken atm, which was why i was trying to get mobdebug installed. So, I won't have results for you anytime soon (have a long afternoon meeting I'm going to get sucked into in 20 minutes) but I will test when I can
[21:40:49] <d1rewolf> guarantee it will work though based on reading the code. seems pretty straightforward
[21:41:03] <wbthomason[m]> No worries. If I get to testing before you, I'll go ahead and merge
[21:41:07] <wbthomason[m]> Yeah, it's a pretty safe change overall
[21:41:50] <d1rewolf> thank you very much for your assistance (and for packer). And thanks clason[m] and mjlbach[m] as well. Neovim has such a helpful community ;) 
[21:42:12] <clason[m]> <wbthomason[m]> "clason: that's only if you use..." <- `fatal: Cannot setup tracking information; starting point 'origin/feature/rocks-in-table-startup' is not a branch.`
[21:42:12] <clason[m]> 😬
[21:42:24] <clason[m]> so  `gh` was a bad suggestion ;)
[21:43:15] <wbthomason[m]> Oh huh. I actually would've expected that to work. That's how I usually test PRs
[21:43:29] <clason[m]> me, too

[21:49:14] <wbthomason[m]> Ah, if we need to debug more in depth, we might want to stop spamming the main channel and go to the packer room
