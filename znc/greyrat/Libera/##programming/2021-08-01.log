[00:09:31] <mrig> pyzozord: So far as I understand it a category is a 'meta' set, where sets are more mathematical, categories are referring to a less rigidly structured logic.

[00:10:43] <mrig> could be that my understanding is not correct yet though, still learning the words.
[00:10:57] <pyzozord> Ah yeah I just watched this video yesterday. To be honest I wasn't able to follow it
[00:12:49] <mrig> categories really do call back to the way that objects used to be perceived. I just watched the Alan Kay turing award speech that you recommended and he mentions objects in this way in that, which is why it springs to mind.
[00:13:03] <mrig> thanks for the recommendation, great lecture.
[00:13:41] <pyzozord> no worries, yeah it was a good one. The category theory must have skipped my attention.
[00:14:01] <pyzozord> I think I'm not ready for category or type theories. I need tos tart with the "basics": set theory and group theory

[00:15:33] <mrig> yes this seems to come into view in quite a curious way, I's quite simple but there seem to be a few penny drop moments that go into seeing that.

[00:35:49] <Guest9> what are other ways to deal with audio files?
[00:35:50] <pyzozord> you could use data urls for encoding https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs
[00:36:01] <cis> Guest9: I guess you could convert it to the csv's charset, and escape any commas

[00:36:16] <Guest9> how to store multiple audio files, and relate with database?
[00:36:38] <pyzozord> give them unique names and store the names in the database
[00:36:45] <eyynet4> Guest9 obviously yes you can, bytes are the ideal audio format though
[00:37:17] <Guest9> pyzozord that seems simplest way out
[00:37:36] <Guest9> but where to store audio files?
[00:37:44] <eyynet4> on your storage device?
[00:37:53] <pyzozord> Guest9: storing big binary blobs in database seems like a bad idea in general, although I'm sure some databases support that better than others

[00:38:19] <pyzozord> filesysem is the database system designed to store big binary blobs

[00:38:49] *** Joins: Crescendo (~Crescendo@user/crescendo)
[00:39:12] <eyynet4> if you want it to take 8 years processing the data, sure use a text format
[00:39:31] <pyzozord> I'd just give store files with unique names on the disk and store those unique names in the database with some other metadata so it's easy to find
[00:40:49] <Guest9> if i could store data in sheet/csv file then i can import to database table of anvil.works
[00:41:15] <Guest9> if i keep audio files separate, then i need to keep my machine as server.
[00:41:22] <Guest9> i think so
[00:41:29] <eyynet4> you can do that anyway you don't need text format
[00:41:45] <mrig> Guest9: you could just use a hashmap of key value pairs.
[00:41:46] <pyzozord> you need a server that runs your python code no matter what you do
[00:42:12] <mrig> write to a file for permanence, csv if you like..
[00:42:14] <Guest9> anvil.works has server code-web based, i dont need to attach my PC continuously for that

[00:47:54] <Guest9> so normally, people use metadata like filepath where "individual audio/media files are stored" in database table?
[00:48:00] <cis> maybe you could get away with it if they're something like short sound effects... but even then... why do it that way?
[00:48:12] <Guest9> instead of storing actual audio/media file within database table?
[00:48:28] <cis> Guest9: yeah, or a unique identifier, like an object_id, which you then use to generate a filepath, or a URL to a service like S3 or others
[00:48:32] <eyynet4> do you even really need a database?
[00:48:32] <Guest9> or are there any other kind of database available for handling audio/media files specifically?
[00:49:07] <eyynet4> yeah its called a file system
[00:49:24] <cis> I'm guessing he wants to store metadata along with audio files

[02:07:14] <blahboybaz> ^ Theres what I'm looking at
[02:09:39] <pyzozord> blahboybaz: are you aware that jest can generate a coverage report in html with the actual code color coded for coverage? Maybe you are assuming the wrong place is the problem
[02:10:51] <pyzozord> blahboybaz: check in coverage/lcov-report/index.html it might be already there, if not try different --coverage flags to make it generate
[02:11:00] <blahboybaz> pyzozord: That would be cool to check out but also I thought that the line numbers given in the output are the line numbers that aren't being covered

[02:12:01] <pyzozord> blahboybaz: seeing a visualized version might provide more insight
[02:12:19] <pyzozord> blahboybaz: I'd also add add variables to the console log to see the values
[02:12:44] <pyzozord> blahboybaz: it might be that you have double conditions like so if (cond1 || cond2) and cond2 is never hit

[03:37:09] <StayHungry> Evening, comrades. Perhaps some of you are skilled enough in windows batches. I have a edge case not sure how if possible to resolve with abilities of a command shell. The following batch check if dropped items are either folders or files (to process them later) -> https://bpa.st/C5EA Edge case if when a folder has a trailing space, e.g. "d:\Hello ", it is identified as error.

[04:05:43] <StayHungry> v2 is bundled with w7 and onward and is available for download for xp sp3. by default it has strictly limited in terms what is allowed and throws 'scary' errors ir red. update to 5 changes the way scripts invoked, so positional command-lnie arguments don't work as expected. scripts have to be in utf8 with bom if non-ascii is used, which frightens even more, etc
[04:07:59] <Arahael> StayHungry: why not provide an .exe then?
[04:08:02] <StayHungry> one of my fav PS quirks is that it waits only for strings from output, so you cannot just throw some binary data into pipeline and expect PS to process it without a page-long function
[04:09:27] <Arahael> also, XP!? why still xp?
[04:10:14] <StayHungry> exe is overkill when you need just a basic wrapper around tools. for example, i have a batch file that takes url as input and asks which downloader tools to use further (be it Aria2 for magnet/torrent links, Curl/Wget for https, Youtube-DL for media, Streamlink for streams)

Right now I use own parser based on regular expressions, like one user described it: 'comma separated headers with space separated data in blank-line separated paragraphs'. Perhaps YAML would fit, but it is not available out of the box.

[06:09:03] <Arahael> blahboybaz: I'm having a bit of trouble determining what you're doing.  I mean, if you don't provide a null, it seems you effectively treat it as a size of zero. I'm not sure what the problem there is as far as the constructor is concerned.

[06:13:56] <blahboybaz> It seems to me that the validateInitializationInput() function being passed into the constructor IS an argument and as such could break something if I don't implement it correctly.

[11:00:27] <causative_> the reason the first one is more bug-prone is that you have to remember to update the list for every *way* an object could possibly set a new stylesheet
[11:00:48] <causative_> if there are multiple ways to do this, or you expect you might add more ways in the future, there is the risk of forgetting to update it for one of the ways

[11:06:53] <causative_> there should be a name for this type of problem - might call it a boundary/region problem.  Where you want to track the "things" that are in a region, and your choice is between updating whenever an object enters or exits the region, or alternatively each time you need to know you count everything in the region
[11:06:59] <CoderGuy> Arahael, yeah that is my main problem here, sucks that i'm using a library for the styling cuz what i'd super love is to just store the results over the stylesheet
[11:07:23] <CoderGuy> ohhh
[11:07:29] <CoderGuy> causative_, you right, that's like render distance stuff
[11:07:39] <causative_> counting on enter/exit, or "boundary counting," is more bug prone but usually faster

[11:21:45] <user51> Arahael: milk gives me weird reactions. i can handle a bit but past a certain point it gets ugly. but it seems like i can adapt to it to some degree.
[11:22:09] <Arahael> user51: You may have some (mild?) lactose intolerance.  Some people do well with tablets that help with that.
[11:22:51] <GeDaMo> I believe other kinds of milk are available nowadays :P
[11:22:51] <user51> could be. or maybe i just need to add some extra milk every day and see what happens in a month.
[11:23:52] <Arahael> user51: If it's lactose intollerance, generally you're missing an actual gut enzyme.  Many asians and other cultures who do not traditionally regularly drink milk have the same issue.
[11:24:20] <GeDaMo> Milk tolerance into adulthood is a relatively recent evolution

[14:02:32] <pyzozord> yeah early returns, extracting the most common case as default, things like that
[14:03:05] <pyzozord> and better naming because it will lead to help reason about this code in more real world terms
[14:04:43] <Guest9> yes, there is so pyzozord the code which you linked is giving sometimes "out of list index error", i tried it earlier.
[14:05:13] <pyzozord> I wasn't careful, this was just an idea for you
[14:05:32] <Guest9> ok, i got your idea in general
[14:06:11] <mrig> Guest9: what is len 3 ?
[14:06:25] <Guest9> ok, if all of you are wondering about naming then let me state this clearly:
[14:06:27] <mrig> what does the clause define?
[14:06:56] <Guest9> this is nothing but separating each character from a word. and then displaying on it a different field(space=text field) in UI.
[14:07:11] <mrig> I know that k2 is a mountain :P
[14:07:23] <Guest9> since each word may have differnt size, hence i am disappearing some field based on size(length) of word.
[14:08:04] <pyzozord> Yeah something like RichText should be helpful here. This is kind of a code smell.
[14:08:46] <pyzozord> In normal html you can format things without naming them, but because anvil.works is just normal python with objects, it requires every object to be named

[14:10:53] <pyzozord> you'd just do <span>word1<span><span style="color: red">word2</span> etc
[14:11:11] <pyzozord> but the whole point of anvil.works is that you /not/ use html

[14:12:06] <Guest9> i mean if something is more convenient & coder can understand, then no issue in adopting it
[14:12:38] <pyzozord> I think RichText is the right thing for this it lets you construct a string with both the content text and formatting information
[14:12:57] <pyzozord> so it's a bit like html, but still it conforms to how anvil.works wants to do things
[14:13:59] <cis> It sounds like you should be generating the number of fields you need based on the characters you want to display in them, instead of hiding and showing them.
[14:14:19] <pyzozord> Problem is that convenience and understanding is not separate from the context. In this context we are operating within a framework with philosophies and conventions, so the best thing we can do for making the code understandable is to follow the local conventions
[14:16:51] <pyzozord> also what cis said, using labels like you use them it's probably abuse. This seems very much like a code smell, so it should motivate you to look for alternative solutions

[18:17:13] <pulse> yeah might wanna upgrade, modern laptops are somewhat better with heat
[18:17:33] <pulse> better lithography == less power draw == better thermals (sometimes significantly)
[18:17:39] <mrig> The throttling kicked in in 2015/16 I think.
[18:17:48] <mrig> the extensive use of that is.
[18:17:53] <pulse> my laptop is a 2019 model and it's quite ok
[18:17:57] <pulse> about 50ish C on load
[18:18:06] <pulse> up to maybe 60 on heavy load
[18:18:12] <mrig> mine 2016 it throttles down much of the time.
[18:18:23] <pulse> it's better to throttle usually
[18:18:32] <pulse> than overheat components
[18:18:35] <pyzozord> It's not a problem for me per se. Im more worried about longevity of my laptop. I think it's pretty comfortable at 47-55°C. It has 87°C marked as high and +105°C as critical.
[18:18:51] <pulse> realistically it will shut down at 90C anyway

[23:42:56] <mrig> I blame Lenny Henry the 1980's British comic, his parodied use of the term 'wicked'; suspecting it to be the root event that caused all wiki's. Dawn French may also be partly to blame, for lending credence to his diction. Will someone please call the spacetime grammar police!
[23:45:41] <hi^-^> what can go wrong parsing xml/html using regex?
[23:46:35] <mrig> :D

[23:51:30] <mrig> hi^-^: It would be pretty hard to deal with line breaks in the the formatting.
[23:53:39] <pyzozord> are you serious? I love it. https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming
[23:53:46] <pyzozord> Finally someone speaking my language
[23:54:28] <pyzozord> "Dynamic programming is a method of solving problems, which is used in computer science, mathematics and economics." vs "Dynamic programming is both a mathematical optimization method and a computer programming method."

[23:56:26] <pyzozord> Ofen I just want to know what things are, and real wikipedia is sometimes difficult to decipher fast
[23:56:30] <hi^-^> mrig: I wanted to put libraries inside a lua environment, so people can write scrappers and show the data in websites.

[23:57:13] <hi^-^> mrig: and i am stuck in the choice to either bind to some big, bad C library like libxml2
[23:57:29] <mrig> hi^-^: I think that xml/html could make a good test material for structural regular expressions.
[23:57:43] <hi^-^> or simply let people breakdown it using regex
[23:58:02] <mrig> having a nice parse tree would be idea.
[23:58:25] <hi^-^> shouldn't be hard, I have extracted text from LibreOffice garbage using it

[23:58:55] <hi^-^> there could be a dehtmlify() function as well
[23:59:16] <mrig> is there not a c html parsing library?
[23:59:48] <hi^-^> which turns &lt; &nbps; <br/> etc etc to normal human chars
