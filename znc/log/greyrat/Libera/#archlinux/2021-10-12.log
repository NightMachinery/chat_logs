[08:28:14] <DeeJayh> low-key: it might simply already have priority over waybar in the window manager? sounds like your basic "stay on top" option to me
[08:28:43] <low-key> is that unique to the set of programs i have installed or is that a redundant option then?
[08:29:11] <DeeJayh> I would hazard to say that it depends on your window manager. Have you checked the `man` for bemenu?
[08:29:20] <low-key> i indeed did
[08:29:29] <low-key> that's where i discovered the option and what it was supposed to do
[08:30:54] <DeeJayh> The man specs it to be Wayland specific, so I would try some search engine queries regarding it and the wayland compositor. Might be something specific to it that the option was added for.
[08:30:55] <J9gen> I have never used the option and it has always been ontop of everything

[11:45:48] <raster> nyaaaa
[11:46:17] <frojnd> Anyone else have problems with bluetooth headsets? Yesterday it worked. I disconnected headphones,... quited bluetoothctl. Today I started bluetoothctl but I get busy message: Failed to set power on: org.bluez.Error.Failed
[11:46:17] <low-key> trying to set a font in wezterm and using font = wezterm.font("OperatorMonoSSm Nerd Font") matches the font but picks the bold weight by default

[11:51:12] <raster> frojnd:  so is bluetoothd (bluez) running at all?
[11:51:34] <frojnd> NetSysFire: yes I restarted service. No good
[11:51:41] <NetSysFire> check your journal
[11:52:01] <raster> check process list - is it even running?
[11:52:10] <raster> i suspect it is..
[11:52:17] <raster> what kind of bt? usb dongle? built-in?
[11:52:31] <frojnd> raster: some chip awei aearbuds
[11:52:38] <raster> sometimes your bt is part of a combo bt+wifi chip.
[11:52:43] <NetSysFire> if bluez wouldnt be running, you wouldnt get a "busy" message
[11:52:44] <frojnd> raster:yeah built in with wifi
[11:52:48] <raster> frojnd:  no the bt itself - not the headphones
[11:52:57] <NetSysFire> and if it worked yesterday then its probably just a transient issue
[11:53:15] <NetSysFire> !itcrowd
[11:53:16] <phrik> Have you tried turning it off and on again?

[11:54:51] <NetSysFire> you need to though
[11:54:52] <frojnd> And I have to use my wired headphones which have really bad mic lol
[11:55:02] <NetSysFire> so either wait until its over or just reboot
[11:55:10] <NetSysFire> its an excuse to leave the boring meeting
[11:55:17] <frojnd> NetSysFire: true that

[11:57:31] <frojnd> Only error for bluetooth I see from journal is this: Oct 12 08:04:09 worklap dbus-daemon[1472]: [system] Rejected send message, 0 matched rules; type="error", sender=":1.29" (uid=1000 pid=3705 comm="/usr/bin/pipewire-media-session ") interface="(unset)" member="(unset)" error name="org.bluez.MediaEndpoint1.Error.NotImplemented" requested_reply="0" destination=":1.34" (uid=0 pid=5008

[23:23:19] <nemesis128> Hi, arch users! My first time here, though I've been using archlinux for quite sometime.
[23:23:29] <thurstylark> !give nemesis128 welcome
[23:23:30] <phrik> nemesis128: Welcome to #archlinux, tell us how you fucked up.
[23:23:47] <nemesis128> Ha ha, that's a good one!
[23:23:52] <susi> thurstylark: meant whether you're gonna make it private again, but I already cloned ^_^
[23:23:54] <aqx> Hi nemesis128, I'm a newbie too ;)
[23:24:02] * thurstylark is just realizing that all his other dotfiles repos are private too...
[23:24:10] <thurstylark> nah, meant to leave it open 
[23:24:15] <thurstylark> at least some repos :P

[23:25:23] <nemesis128> I wanted to ask if there is any reason to GnuPG and pinentry packages not being updated since some time.
[23:25:24] <jcbjoe2021> Since arch is a rolling release hoe many times a week should you -Syu and is it mandatory? To keep system updated and running?
[23:25:33] <jcbjoe2021> How*
[23:26:30] <Namarrgon> it's not "mandatory" but the longer you wait inbetween updates the more complicated they tend to get
[23:26:48] <Pericles> jcbjoe2021 I can't tell you what's right but I CAN tell you that I do -Syu like idk once a month XD  Ik I'm a very irresponsible individual
[23:27:00] <thurstylark> !best

[23:27:22] <Pericles> at least that's what I do on this Manjaro installation
