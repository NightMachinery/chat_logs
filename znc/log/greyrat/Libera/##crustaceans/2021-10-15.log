[00:04:11] <imode> ah shit my push and pop byte instructions for the different cursors are messed up.
[00:04:53] <imode> the ones that work from the head of the deque need to push the byte in reverse.
[00:13:31] <dimadima> what task
[00:20:49] <Brekkjern> Shortest path through a graph, but also print the edge you pass through
[00:21:08] <Brekkjern> Then after you've done that, it's weighted edges doing the same
[00:21:10] <gerikson> sounds like a job for... Djikstra's !
[00:21:36] <Brekkjern> Then after that you gotta figure out how many components are in the dataset
[00:21:46] <imode> what's this task for, uni?
[00:21:50] <Brekkjern> Yes
[00:21:55] <imode> fuun.
[00:21:56] <Brekkjern> My code is absolute ass though :S
[00:22:06] <imode> graph algos rarely end up looking pretty.
[00:22:12] <imode> unless you do it in like.
[00:22:14] <Brekkjern> Yeah, but this is especially ass...
[00:22:18] <imode> apache tinker or whatever.
[00:22:26] <imode> tinkerpop.
[00:22:30] <imode> Brekkjern: show meh.

[00:23:50] <Brekkjern> Knock yourself out :P
[00:24:09] <Brekkjern> It started out looking somewhat pretty, and then it just deteriorated rapidly
[00:24:46] <Brekkjern> Nodes are actors. Actors are related through the movies they have starred in
[00:24:53] <imode> I don't see a problem with this.
[00:25:20] <Brekkjern> It's fine. It's just... Annoying to get both the movie and actor in the path
[00:25:25] <Brekkjern> It's also somewhat slow
[00:26:01] <Brekkjern> There's about 1 million actors in the dataset, and about 4 million edges
[00:26:13] <imode> naive graph algorithms are expensive.
[00:26:21] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[00:27:16] <indigo> Lol, iOS 15
[00:27:26] <indigo> Why the fuck would you move the damn address bar to the BOTTOM
[00:27:48] <indigo> I guess that's how you get promoted these days
[00:28:03] <Brekkjern> Anywho... I'm gonna hop to bed.
[00:28:05] <Brekkjern> Night!
[00:28:09] <indigo> Night Brekkjern!
[00:28:25] <imode> laaaater.
[00:31:57] <dimadima> night
[00:32:01] <dimadima> indigo: you can move it back
[00:32:11] <dimadima> (in safari settings)
[00:32:43] <indigo> Oh awesome. I hope they track metrics for how many people move it back
[00:34:02] <indigo> Can you also get rid of the "lobsters got murdered" blood red at the top
[00:34:12] <indigo> Ah perfect, website tinting
[00:34:31] <dimadima> website tinting?
[00:35:08] <indigo> Yeah it turns your top bar where the notch is red (or whatever color the website chooses)
[00:35:32] <dimadima> oh that's what that's called? saw that on android for the first time the other day
[00:35:39] <dimadima> did you say that with sarcasm?
[00:35:46] <dimadima> iOS 15 supports that now?
[00:36:17] <dimadima> s/the other day/yesterday
[00:36:22] <dimadima> and on lobste.rs, as a matter of fact
[00:36:50] <indigo> Website tinting is a real thing
[00:37:23] <dimadima> yeah i understood that to be a real term
[00:37:31] <dimadima> i just wasn't sure whther you were actually enthusiastic for it
[00:37:58] <dimadima> either way, i appreciate you teaching me what that was called! had no idea what it was
[00:42:03] <indigo> All good man.

[01:36:43] <dimadima> if you say it's worthwhile i'll click but he's terrible to look at
[01:37:04] <imode> it's zuck as-a-human going through a lot of period-accurate technology behind up-and-coming facebook, google, eBay, etc.
[01:37:20] <imode> as a lecture to students. worth a click.
[01:38:32] <dimadima> i'll click but i'll say that i am highly suspcious of the concept of zuck-as-a-human
[01:38:38] <dimadima> ZaaH
[01:38:42] <imode> hahahahahahahahahahaha.
[01:40:10] <dimadima> thanks imode
[01:40:26] <imode> np.
[01:40:33] <bkero> I'm highly suspicious of zuck as a source of period-accurate technology trends
[01:40:46] <bkero> Source: Consider PHP's relevance in his life.
[01:40:51] <dimadima> lol starts with a douchy harvard joke
[01:41:47] <indigo> Hey, tons of big sites were built on PHP
[01:44:17] <bkero> Tons of big sites started on PHP
[01:44:26] <bkero> A dwindling number of them didn't move off after a decade.
[01:46:11] <imode> hacking shit together is underrated.
[01:46:19] <imode> and PHP is good for hacking shit together.
[01:46:41] <bkero> That's true
[01:46:51] <dimadima> lol dude comes in at 6:24 and sits down
[01:46:58] <bkero> At some point your stack enters a period of maturity in which it's inappropriate to hack shit together.
[01:47:11] <bkero> Probably around the time you start implementing service meshes.
[01:47:11] <dimadima> you missed the first 5 minutes of mark zuckerberg talking to an empty lecture hall bro!
[01:47:19] <dimadima> what a world
[01:47:56] <indigo> Lol, service meshes
[01:48:30] <indigo> Gotta get that sidecar proxy going
[01:48:53] <dimadima> one fun thing about react is how it was inspired by PHP
[01:48:59] <dimadima> i believe it was this talk http://blog.vjeux.com/2014/javascript
[01:49:00] <buttsbot> Vjeux » 2014
[01:49:20] <dimadima> although i'm not sure
[01:49:31] <bkero> If you want an actually good lecture: https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript
[01:49:31] <buttsbot> -     The Birth & Death of JavaScript -
[01:49:39] <imode> that's a fantastic lecture.
[01:49:54] <dimadima> the birth and death of javascript?
[01:50:01] <imode> yep.
[01:50:18] <dimadima> hey two talks can co-exist in this world
[01:54:32] <ngoldbaum> bkero: how about when you start reimplementing php in your own VM
[01:55:03] <bkero> ngoldbaum: https://tiotee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/redirect04062021070452-800x800.jpg
[01:55:25] <ngoldbaum> tell facebook
[01:55:32] <bkero> Out of everyone's complaints about PHP I think a very small number of them are qualities of the VM.
[01:56:04] <ngoldbaum> https://hacklang.org
[01:56:04] <buttsbot> Hack
[01:56:26] <bkero> That's an artifact of the first time someone got stockholm syndrome for PHP.
[01:56:53] <ngoldbaum> rather than rewriting the webapp in something besides php it was cheaper to come up with hhvm/hack
[01:57:27] <bkero> Yep, that has precedence. See all of the business-critical COBOL software running on (emulated) mainframes
[02:04:47] <dimadima> imode: yeah this is pretty neat/interesting. thanks for it
[02:05:01] <dimadima> i'm going to stop watching it because it's making me quite anxious
[02:05:10] <dimadima> but pretty neat
[02:08:12] <dimadima> hey if anyone knows anything about launching products and/or could critique my landing page, please pm me
[02:11:59] <imode> I need to shower because I smell like a barn fucked a clam flat, but I'd be happy to look after.

[14:59:59] <prussian> I still have github repos with master branches...
[15:01:44] <gerikson> just another front in the culture wars
[15:02:30] <prussian> I have to laugh if you create a repo via web gui how it gives you copy/paste instructions that makes you checkout `main` though.
[15:03:10] <prussian> I just set init.defaultBranch to 'release'

[15:27:51] <dimadima> morning
[15:28:44] <dimadima> when i first started messing with computers it was IDE drives and i was pretty surprised to learn the nomenclature was master/slave
[15:29:29] <dimadima> i'm not exactly a "woke" person but i think i had recently learned about slavery in america and was taken aback by it. was probably... 8 years old? 9 years old?
[15:29:57] <gerikson> most normal people think like you dimadima
[15:30:07] <dimadima> seems... unecessary
[15:30:17] <gerikson> it's jsut the 4chan / neorax crowd who make a big deal about it
[15:30:22] <dimadima> i see
[15:30:32] <gerikson> doon you won't be able to work in IT if you're white!
[15:30:38] *** Quits: jaix` (~jaix@user/jaix) (Quit: Leaving)
[15:31:19] <dimadima> i noticed the other day real estate listings in New York use the term "primary bedroom" now
[15:31:24] <Brekkjern> If so we gotta import a lot of people from around the world to keep this org running, gerikson...
[15:31:33] <dcz> the master part never struck me as odd (I know people with a master degree, it's a useful word), but slave was unambiguous even back then
[15:31:53] <Brekkjern> dcz: Pretty much this for me too
[15:31:58] <dimadima> ya master's degree never struck me as odd either
[15:32:07] <dimadima> maybe cause it's like you've mastered something
[15:32:21] <dimadima> IDE though, with the explicit master/slave

[15:32:34] <buttsbot> Twitter - dodaistewart - apparently if you pay $65k a month rent New York harbor turns Caribbean blue  https://t.co/IMe3KCi2nW
[15:32:35] <gerikson> I guess master/replica would be less problematic
[15:32:38] <dcz> "master" is close to "champion" in some languages
[15:32:45] <gerikson> but it's not really the same
[15:32:52] <dimadima> gerikson: that wasn't even the relationship though
[15:32:56] <dimadima> it was just two hard drives lol
[15:32:59] <Brekkjern> gerikson: No. Replica means a copy. Not something being controlled by something else.
[15:33:10] <gerikson> zactly
[15:33:23] <dimadima> dcz: interesting
[15:33:44] <gerikson> BUT
[15:33:52] <gerikson> master / slave isn't really a good fit for git
[15:34:00] <gerikson> anyway git never had "slave" repos
[15:34:03] <gerikson> jsut one "master"
[15:34:14] <dimadima> "this exceptional 5-bedroom, 7.5-bathroom penthouse Duplex covers an entire floor with massive *primary* bedroom suite upstairs"
[15:34:20] <dimadima> yeah that's true
[15:34:20] <gerikson> so I guess I'm kinda on board with the critics, except for them being horribly racist
[15:34:21] <Brekkjern> I don't think Git really though about it much. They just copied the naming standard from that other VCS to make the switch easier
[15:34:31] <gerikson> yeah
[15:34:33] <dcz> git never even had a "master", it's decentralized
[15:34:40] <gerikson> +1
[15:34:45] <dcz> "master" is an artifact of how we usually organize repos
[15:34:59] <dimadima> dcz: that's the irony of the git naming choice!
[15:35:10] <gerikson> so removiong "master" is a reflection on how git should worl,  but people get mad
[15:35:16] <dimadima> the big one for me, if anything
[15:35:26] <dcz> "main" is not any better this way :)
[15:35:34] <gerikson> because, again, they're racist or want to excuse racism or think fighting racism isn't important
[15:35:35] <dimadima> yep
[15:35:43] <gerikson> dcz: true!
[15:35:45] <Brekkjern> My default branch name is "trunk"
[15:35:45] <dimadima> i've always thought trunk was a lot cuter
[15:35:50] <dimadima> jinx
[15:35:52] <Brekkjern> Because it's soooo much better :P
[15:36:01] <dimadima> i think of a little trunk
[15:40:31] <gerikson> I can also agree with everyone not affected by the systemic racism in the US who might feel put out by this
[15:40:39] <gerikson> the solution, as ever, is market-based
[15:40:42] <gerikson> use another forge
[15:41:05] <gerikson> but the dirty secret is that Github is *really good* and popular
[15:41:15] <Brekkjern> The solution is to generate a random default branch name by combining 3 different words
[15:42:11] <Brekkjern> Every time you make a new repo, it will select something ridiculous, so you actively have to change it or get stuck with KindlyShorttermGrayfox
[15:44:02] <dcz> omg this is the perfect troll
[15:44:13] <dcz> I'm going to put jokes in my default branches from now on

[15:48:37] <prussian> trunk... I like it.

[15:50:07] <Brekkjern> Thank you. Very helpful.
[15:50:49] <dcz> I'm mildly surprised the MemoryError was successfully allocated
[15:51:26] <prussian> Probably, reserves space just for that exception.
[15:51:30] <prussian> lol
[15:51:36] <prussian> beautiful python..
[15:51:44] <Brekkjern> I'm impresed how much memory this uses
[15:52:31] <Brekkjern> It peaks at about 1100MB, and the two input files are 1MB and 3,5MB each.
[15:52:37] <prussian> I don't know. People use python for all the big datas now
[15:52:39] <Geekingfrog> :D
[15:52:46] <Brekkjern> Sure
[15:52:51] <prussian> damn...
[15:53:04] <Brekkjern> The input data just doesn't seem all that large :P
[15:53:08] <prussian> Man, the office was hilarious drama.
[15:53:18] <prussian> can't believe how angsty people on my team are...
[15:56:39] <Geekingfrog> What do you mean?
[15:59:20] <dimadima> "Github is *really good*" | I love GH  but i would say it's really good. it's amazing given its scale, BUT its UI leaves so much to be desired for me. like, you close an issue and none of the counts change. the incidence of errors around opening/closing issues is also quite high
[15:59:34] <dimadima> s/would/wouldn't/
[16:00:02] <dimadima> anyway GH is my favorite website on the net and i'm not ashamed to admit it
[16:01:14] <dimadima> "Every time you make a new repo, it will select something ridiculous" <- call it "DaDaHub"
[16:01:40] <dimadima> i wanted to name my LLC "Dada Engineering LLC" but i was afraid this would lead ppl to think i was just trolling
[16:02:10] <deadk> i don't understand how anyone can enjoy GH
[16:02:16] <deadk> all of its feature suck
[16:02:35] <dimadima> deadk: show me a website that doesn't suck
[16:02:40] <dimadima> and has features
[16:02:42] <gwozniak> Honestly, I have yet to use it
[16:03:02] <Brekkjern> https://lobste.rs/s/ekkfkf/lantenna_attack_reveals_ethernet_cable
[16:03:02] <Brekkjern> How many times do we have to reinvent TEMPEST?
[16:03:03] <buttsbot> LANtenna attack reveals Ethernet cable traffic contents | Lobsters
[16:03:06] <dimadima> anyway what i like about it is there are people on there who are interested in computers and programming. the highest concentration of such people in the world
[16:03:18] <dimadima> people and projects and communities
[16:03:26] <deadk> i'm not sure if there are really
[16:03:55] <dimadima> deadk: what other site is a contender for that title?
[16:04:01] <deadk> i feel like github is dominated by corporate projects and terrible web shit
[16:04:09] <dcz> use shielded cables, problem solved
[16:04:13] <deadk> lobsters probably has a higher concentration of people who are interested in computers
[16:04:14] <dimadima> terrible web shit yes, but corporations?
[16:04:27] <dimadima> deadk: really? lobsters?
[16:04:34] <dimadima> not HN?
[16:05:00] <deadk> i think HN has more people who are interested in tech as an industry, not as a pursuit
[16:05:03] <deadk> i think github does too
[16:05:29] <dcz> agreed about HN
[16:05:37] <dimadima> that could be true. obviosuly i have no numbers or evidence. anyway, that's why i'm here, too
[16:06:03] <dcz> lobsters explicitly disallows non-computing topics, which is why I'm only interested in the irc here
[16:06:27] <dimadima> well there's no other VCS site that's bigger than github. i can't compare and comment on a diff on lobsters
[16:06:55] <dcz> why do we restrict ourselves to sites? the web is already there, a global network of communities
[16:07:06] <Brekkjern> dcz: Shielded cables aren't enough, but they probably do help
[16:07:12] <dimadima> dcz: because they're not federated?
[16:07:25] <dimadima> web 2.0 didn't happen cause of .... money
[16:07:29] <dcz> that's a valid point, but what do you need federation for?
[16:07:38] <dimadima> the interconnection of sites
[16:07:44] <dimadima> if i understood you correctly
[16:07:45] <dcz> like hyperlinks?
[16:07:59] <dimadima> but that's a really limited subset of social features
[16:08:09] <dimadima> links aren't even a social feature
[16:08:12] <dcz> ah, social features are what you're missing
[16:08:26] <dimadima> i guess yeah, sorry about not being clear
[16:08:29] <dcz> gihub does seem to be the biggest social network of coders
[16:08:49] <deadk> it is not much use for socializing though
[16:08:50] <dimadima> i've only had one tech job. the rest of my tech "career" has been lone. so it's important for me to interact and learn from people
[16:09:58] <dimadima> deadk: yeah it's limited in socialization but it's the best there is
[16:10:00] <dcz> I've been there, but what really kicked me off was going to conferences
[16:10:05] <dimadima> deadk: and quite possibly limiting social features is a food thing
[16:10:07] <dimadima> good thing*
[16:10:30] <dcz> granted, conferences aren't always easy to get to
[16:10:35] <dimadima> dcz: waht about conferences? which conferences
[16:10:43] <dimadima> yeah they cost money and travel :)
[16:11:13] <dcz> any conferences, CCC in my case. living in the middle of nowhere has its downsides
[16:11:57] <dcz> hacker spaces are also something I discovered after moving, and also useful for socializing
[16:30:23] <dimadima> dcz: this is CCC? v
[16:30:25] <dimadima> oops: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Congress
[16:30:26] <buttsbot> Chaos Communication Congress - Wikipedia
[16:31:04] <dimadima> It is considered one of the largest events of this kind, alongside the DEF CON in Las Vegas.
[16:31:06] <dcz> yes
[16:31:16] <dimadima> nice
[16:31:22] <dcz> but I started with local events
[16:32:18] <dimadima> for me the social programming experiences on GH were/are really important
[16:32:32] <dimadima> i guess hacker spaces do that too
[16:33:05] <dimadima> i lived in new york, tried to find a hacker space but they were ironically not very welcoming. i don't blame them because they probably get a ton of ppl wasting their time
[16:33:15] <gerikson> new york
[16:33:21] <gerikson> famously friendly place
[16:33:33] <dimadima> hahaha. new york is actually a really friendly place
[16:33:34] <gerikson> "New York nice" is a catchphrase
[16:33:41] <gerikson> like Minnesota Minute
[16:33:50] <gerikson> ;)
[16:33:51] <dimadima> it's true sometimes the niceness is idiosyncratic
[16:33:59] <dimadima> but i've seen incredible acts of kindness in new york
[16:34:14] <dimadima> the humans there are excellent

[16:43:19] <buttsbot> David Dahan
[16:43:27] <prussian> rip.
[16:44:20] <companion_cube> on a page that doesn't load without js
[16:44:23] <companion_cube> the irony
[16:45:09] <dimadima> gerikson: i nice learning experience i had on GH :)
[16:45:44] <dimadima> it shows "closed" but it was merged
[16:46:04] <dimadima> that blog doesn't load w/o JS?
[16:46:36] <dimadima> i wish there was an easy "no JS" mode that ws like private browsing. i usually have JS on
[16:47:16] <dimadima> this blog post is crap though. django didn't decline, the world just moved on
[16:47:22] <companion_cube> I had to enable a domain in umatrix to get something beyond the placeholder
[16:47:49] <dimadima> projects like django fill a void for some time, and that's okay. calling it a "decline" is dumb/clickbaity
[16:48:07] <dimadima> companion_cube: lame
[16:48:38] <dimadima> gerikson: "Outdated collaboration tools"
[16:48:42] <dimadima> GTFO
[16:50:00] <dcz> companion_cube: my first reaction is disabling CSS, that often improves the reading experience too
[16:50:28] <gerikson> dimadima: agree, the world moves
[16:50:42] <gerikson> the writing finger writes, and having written, moves on
[16:51:07] <dimadima> and that's beautiful; not "decline"
[16:52:09] <dimadima> django moved a lot of things forward in a nice way. all the headless CMSs now, none of which i've tried fwiw but it seems like many of them are nice, are probably descendants of rails/djano
[16:52:32] <dimadima> i'm guessing ppl are reading what i'm writing and strongly disagree
[16:52:49] <companion_cube> I wonder if lack of typing is what will do Django in
[16:52:58] <dimadima> given that headless encourages sites that require JS to load HTML text, which is a good criticism
[16:53:20] <dimadima> companion_cube: why not rails, then?
[16:53:53] <companion_cube> idk, rails is also slowly declining, is it not?
[16:54:06] <companion_cube> it's still strong but it's not hype nor growing
[16:54:12] <companion_cube> at least that's my uninformed impression
[16:54:14] <dimadima> yeah definitely not growing or the next new thing
[16:54:35] <companion_cube> I'm afraid the future is JS
[16:54:56] <dimadima> does it make it better for you if it's TS?
[16:56:32] <prussian> always has been
[16:57:11] <companion_cube> well, I mean
[16:57:16] <companion_cube> TS might be better than python
[16:57:37] <companion_cube> although it's crazy that there's nothing for resource handling (like a `with:` block)
[16:57:40] <companion_cube> c r a z y
[16:58:33] <dimadima> there is `finally`... you could use a function to build that abstraction if you wanted?
[16:58:45] <dimadima> but yeah, there is no resource handling
[16:58:56] <companion_cube> it kind of sucks imho
[16:59:02] <companion_cube> with blocks are one of the niceties of python
[16:59:50] <prussian> https://github.com/tc39/proposal-explicit-resource-management
[16:59:51] <buttsbot> GitHub - tc39/proposal-explicit-resource-management: ECMAScript Explicit Resource Management
[16:59:51] <prussian> soon?
[17:00:00] <prussian> bitch to tc39 to get off their ass.
[17:00:08] <prussian> actually don't bother.
[17:00:27] <prussian> should be stage 3 *soon*
[17:00:35] <companion_cube> of course it's also that JS, unlike python, has a spec and multiple implems
[17:00:38] <prussian> which just means chromium will ship it.
[17:00:48] <dimadima> prussian: heh yeah
[17:01:00] <prussian> can't stand tc39...
[17:01:34] <prussian> I like js in that the grammars don't surprise me as much.
[17:01:43] <prussian> unlike stuff like f"{""}"
[17:01:45] <prussian> in python
[17:01:58] <prussian> vs `${``}` in js
[17:02:51] <dimadima> "modern" ES is nice but it's TS that makes it worthwhile for me
[17:03:17] <dimadima> i'm just not smart enough to code w/o types
[17:03:38] <prussian> the future is rescript-lang.org duh... formerly reasonml, formerly bucklescript.
[17:03:49] <dimadima> didn't know they renamed
[17:03:55] <prussian> ya... again
[17:03:56] <dimadima> i' like to learn an ML
[17:04:13] <prussian> rescript's claim to fame is they drop all ocaml compat entirely
[17:04:23] <dimadima> i bet it's cool but for the proponents of reason i'm afraid TS has taken over
[17:04:35] <companion_cube> prussian: it's so rage inducing
[17:04:36] <prussian> rip
[17:04:37] <companion_cube> but well
[17:05:25] <dimadima> companion_cube: what is
[17:05:39] <companion_cube> rescript
[17:05:48] <companion_cube> and the guy is working hard to prevent forks
[17:05:50] <dimadima> why rage inducing?
[17:05:56] <prussian> lol
[17:06:06] <companion_cube> because it's a mess that causes people to be wary of the whole OCaml world
[17:06:28] <prussian> I just follow it because it's hilarious how many transitions it has gone through.
[17:07:09] <companion_cube> yeah and then you have that kind of thread: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/a-short-history-of-rescript-bucklescript/7222
[17:07:09] <dimadima> bucklescript still lives on, though?
[17:07:09] <buttsbot> A short history of ReScript (BuckleScript) - Community - OCaml
[17:07:33] <companion_cube> well, not really
[17:07:35] <prussian> so is claimed.
[17:07:40] <companion_cube> bucklescript is now part of rescript
[17:07:42] <prussian> rescript is a fork off of it
[17:07:45] <companion_cube> but there's a fork called Melange
[17:07:51] <companion_cube> which is trying to stay compatible with OCaml
[17:07:51] <prussian> oh
[17:07:52] <prussian> lol
[17:07:53] <prussian> hahah
[17:08:15] <prussian> I mean I get why rescript happened. supporting ocaml actual and js seemed like a silly goal.
[17:08:16] <prussian> imo
[17:08:21] <prussian> even purescript is its own js thing
[17:09:07] <prussian> ok let me read this ocaml thing. lol
[17:10:52] <dimadima> so what about all the buckelscript in production at bloomberg?
[17:11:06] <dimadima> i can't imagine bloomberg is trying to get its production tech into this stupid shit
[17:11:21] <dimadima> or is that how they placate bored engineers
[17:11:29] <companion_cube> I think you're supposed to migrate to rescript if you use BS
[17:12:00] <dimadima> big money corporations don't just migrate stuff for kicks usually though
[17:12:12] <dimadima> anyone sensible, really, doesn't shut down good code, for that matter
[17:13:27] <companion_cube> I'm not sure he's still working at Bloomberg
[17:13:30] <companion_cube> oh well
[17:13:42] *** Joins: ben_ (ben@libera/staff/ben)
[17:14:57] <prussian> well apparently there is some tool called gentype for typescript/flow to rescript types
[17:15:05] <prussian> so maybe i'll "try it" and see.
[17:15:27] <prussian> bored as fuck and my workie team is all but demoralized unproductive hell
[17:17:31] <gwozniak> $work is giving me a bonus for being vaccinated
[17:18:13] <gerikson> dang
[17:18:15] <gerikson> not bad
[17:19:20] <gwozniak> I'm guessing the motivation is to get everyone vaccinated so they can all be back in the office
[17:28:14] *** ben_ is now known as ben
[17:28:15] <gerikson> oh
[17:29:19] <gerikson> I read somewhere about misaligned incentives where people who admitted being vaccinated were forced to return to the office, while coworkers who either weren't or didn't declare themselves vaccinated could continue to WFH
[17:30:48] <prussian> sounds about right.
[17:31:06] <prussian> I personally haven't officially stated, as in submitted proof of vaxx.
[17:31:42] <Brekkjern> It's illegal for businesses to ask about medical history in Norway, and I bet most of EU really.
[17:32:05] <Brekkjern> Unless it is medically relevant for the job that is
[17:38:13] *** Joins: gthm (~gthm@145-53-37-66.fixed.kpn.net)
[17:38:39] <dimadima> i'd take a bonus for being vaccinated but damn i hate the intrusion of corporations into health
[17:38:53] <dimadima> Brekkjern: good for norway
[17:38:55] <dimadima> that's how it should be
[17:39:11] <dimadima> we're headed hard in the opposite direction in the US
[17:40:01] <dimadima> i've posted this opinion on HN a bunch and ppl always vote me down hard. i guess they want their bosses to how many times a week they work out
[17:40:05] <dimadima> so they can save on healthcare!
[17:40:40] <gerikson> here in Swedne you can get f.ex. gym membership through work
[17:40:49] <gerikson> well you pay like the pre-tax cost
[17:40:59] <companion_cube> knowing whether you have the covid vax, is a very special thing dimadima
[17:41:02] <deadk> in general i agree that medical information should be private, but i'm not sure i think that should extend to infectious diseases
[17:41:02] <dimadima> but you have social healthcare, what does your job care
[17:41:22] <dimadima> deadk: yeah i think with regard to infection disease it's different
[17:41:34] <dimadima> i'm thinking more like everything else
[17:41:39] <gerikson> dimadima: before covid, employers paid for the first 2 weeks if you were sick
[17:41:50] <gerikson> sick leave
[17:41:54] <dimadima> i see
[17:41:57] <dimadima> so they want you healthy
[17:42:02] <gerikson> well
[17:42:10] <companion_cube> it's like vaccination requirements to attend public school
[17:42:13] <dimadima> not like going to the gym actually means you won't catch cold
[17:42:14] <gerikson> it's positioned for stuff like acute accidetns
[17:42:29] <gerikson> if you break your leg at work
[17:42:31] <dimadima> right
[17:42:41] <gerikson> it's in the employer's interest to ensure you don't
[17:42:45] <gerikson> ebcasue it costs them
[17:42:55] <dimadima> so how does the gym help them with that
[17:43:05] <gerikson> gemini://gerikson.com/gemlog/misc/Sweden-lockdowns.gmi
[17:43:22] <gerikson> dimadima: doesn't but it's been superpopualr with whtie-collar employers :D
[17:43:25] <dimadima> i'm not using gemini until it gets JS

[19:04:37] <ngoldbaum> no they definitely did there’s a note at the bottom
[19:05:30] <dimadima> renegade: when conceptual ethods meets real-world branding
[19:06:51] <gerikson> you could be a REBEL in the 80s and buy an affordable Japanese SLR
[19:07:12] <gerikson> later you could be a DIGITAL REBEL
[19:08:14] <gerikson> can;t you be a PROWLER in a certain car?
[19:08:32] <skyl4rk> I had that one, the 350d
[19:08:39] <skyl4rk> was a nice camera
[19:08:43] <dimadima> s/ethods/ethos/
[19:08:53] <dimadima> lol prowler
[19:09:03] <dimadima> yes the 350d was an excellent camera
[19:09:03] <gerikson> skyl4rk: die, Canon heretic
[19:09:05] <gerikson> ;)
[19:09:09] <dimadima> i had it too
[19:09:18] <gerikson> seriously tho, 350D is a classic
[19:09:20] <skyl4rk> hah
[19:09:29] <dimadima> aw i was just typing some trolly stuff
[19:09:30] <skyl4rk> nikon?
[19:09:41] <dimadima> "canon is better than nikon sorry gerikson"
[19:10:01] <dimadima> "who cares about the mount when the lenses are better?"
[19:10:04] <skyl4rk> I've since gone back to film ...helps that the 350d got stolen
[19:10:12] <dimadima> skyl4rk: wow really
[19:10:26] <dimadima> what format? what film?
[19:10:41] <gerikson> skyl4rk: yeah
[19:10:52] <gerikson> oh god photogeeks are everywehere
[19:11:11] <dimadima> photograph was great until it was ruined
[19:11:13] <skyl4rk> well I use the cellphone for when I just want to get some random image, but if it matters it's film
[19:11:50] <dimadima> i wish i hadn't deleted my flickr
[19:12:00] <skyl4rk> I took over/inherited a nikon fe, but it has some issues, also shot some canon f1/ftb but they're at my parents' place (but so am I right now)
[19:12:07] <dimadima> so 35mm?
[19:12:10] <skyl4rk> yeah
[19:12:14] <dimadima> cool
[19:13:06] <dimadima> my project after once-daily messaging platform is going to be something called, like "24" which will be instagram but you only get 24 "exposures" per week
[19:13:11] <skyl4rk> then there's the mamiya rb67 pro sd, PURE MECHANICAL POWER
[19:13:16] <dimadima> oh thats awesome skyl4rk
[19:13:19] <skyl4rk> 6x7 negs (120 film)
[19:13:26] <dimadima> delicious
[19:13:47] <gerikson> skyl4rk: I've rocked the FM2n, and dual Olympus XAs
[19:13:50] <dimadima> my dad has some soviet medium formats that are so nice to use
[19:13:51] <skyl4rk> but there's no "let me just spontaneously bring my camera" about that one
[19:14:01] <dimadima> never stopped weegee
[19:14:09] <gerikson> oh and my first camera was an OM10, upgreyyed to an OM-1 in silver
[19:14:30] <gerikson> I've used an RB67 too
[19:14:44] <dimadima> i've never laid my hands on a mamiya
[19:15:03] <dimadima> my filthy proletarian hands
[19:15:17] <skyl4rk> it's very nice, heavy, big, sure - but nice to work with
[19:15:20] <dimadima> only the scoviet copies :)

[19:16:44] <skyl4rk> as for film, mostly ilford hp5+ these days, which I tend to push, since I usually use existing light

[19:18:33] <ngoldbaum> what year is it
[19:18:52] <skyl4rk> hah, then feel this out in your mind: I shoot my beauuutiful laaaarge 6x7 negs ...and then digitize them by holding them in front of some light source and shoot them with my cell phone
[19:19:26] <gerikson> ngoldbaum: it was sold to ... some other site
[19:19:34] <dimadima> skyl4rk: lol
[19:19:36] <gerikson> skyl4rk: *hurl*
[19:19:36] <skyl4rk> ...the plan is to get a proper enlarger

[19:19:37] <dimadima> kline: that's awesome
[19:19:46] <dimadima> erm sorry not kline. skyl4rk ^
[19:19:46] <gerikson> oh yeah defect thx
[19:19:49] <skyl4rk> but the market for anything > 6x6 is not that good
[19:20:06] <gerikson> I picked up an enlarger that was set out for recycling
[19:20:18] <gerikson> but Ithink it's only >=6x6
[19:20:30] <gerikson> was gonna put it up for sale but Shit Happened
[19:20:40] <gerikson> sorry <=
[19:20:43] <gerikson> dang maths
[19:20:51] <skyl4rk> so to get things out quickly to be able to show it to the friends I took pictures of I've half-assed the print side
[19:21:11] <skyl4rk> love the cat on the chair btw
[19:21:15] <gerikson> you wanna get a decent ~50mm macro lens

[19:22:55] <dimadima> endless free enlargers out there the last 10-15 years
[19:23:25] <skyl4rk> out there perhaps, but not out here

[19:26:27] <gerikson> also wear reflexes and lights!

[19:27:55] <dimadima> with your bike safety
[19:28:27] <dimadima> they don't tell you this in the US, but perhaps the only dumber thing than drunk driving is drunk biking
[19:29:35] <gerikson> well
[19:29:56] <gerikson> if you're drunk on a bike you're unlikely to kill anyone other than yourself
[19:30:10] <gerikson> if you're drunk in a car it's the opposite
[19:30:18] <gerikson> so ok it's dumber
[19:30:23] <dimadima> that's true

[20:06:22] *** Joins: imode (~imode@user/imode)
[20:06:36] <gerikson> kinda surprised they're letting Steam siphon off some of that sweet sweet crapto lucre, it should be a slam dunk to start their own damn game store
[20:07:02] <gerikson> oh wait, crapto is a parasitic grwoth on the body economic, so that won't work
[20:07:17] <ngoldbaum> i love how the reason for this is that isis was trading tf2 hats or some bullshit
[20:07:25] <imode> what.
[20:07:50] <imode> ISIS was trading TF2 hats?
[20:07:59] <indigo> I'm kinda curious what game mechanic used NFTs
[20:08:20] <ngoldbaum> https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50262447.amp i seem to remember that but can’t find a news story besides this one
[20:08:34] <imode> a good application of NFTs would be selling your character as an NFT after leveling up.
[20:08:43] <ngoldbaum> indigo: they want to make weapons NFTs so you “own” your loot
[20:09:25] <imode> grind to the top, sell your character, then the hosting marketplace makes bank on resales.

[20:14:22] <imode> the new animal crossing update looks lit.
[20:15:35] <imode> I feel like that's an underserved genre of game on other platforms.
[20:15:49] <imode> if it came to PC nobody would get anything done.
[20:16:45] <pja> Going to guess that Steam really, really doesn’t want the slightest risk of being classified as a gambling platform.
[20:17:02] <pja> They’re sailing a bit close to the wind with CS:GO tradeable items as it is.
[20:17:32] <pja> Actually trading real money (even if it’s crypto money) items in a Steam game is asking for troublel
[20:19:22] <imode> the first time I heard the words "TF2 economy" in a serious context is the day I softly wept for that game.
[20:23:52] <imode> aaaaa animal crossing has a campaign mode now.
[20:23:56] <imode> that's neat.
[20:25:48] <pja> Wasn’t it Yanis Varoufakis that Valve employed back then?
[20:25:59] <pja> (checks: it was!)
[20:27:13] <ngoldbaum> yup, secretary of tf2 hats
[20:27:32] <ngoldbaum> and then he did a bunch of questionable things in greece

[23:02:35] <riv> good advice!
[23:02:40] <riv> you can always just walk away
[23:02:43] <riv> applies to more than just jobs
[23:02:56] <companion_cube> always look at the bright side of life, too!

[23:03:11] <imode> dimadima: what'd he tell you to quit.
[23:03:45] <dimadima> i was trying to make some crepes
[23:03:52] <imode> bahahahahahahaha.
[23:03:55] <imode> okay I see why he told you that.
[23:04:05] <dimadima> i don't it was pretty stunning
[23:04:14] <imode> they're hard to make iirc.
[23:04:16] <dimadima> they weren't event coming out /that bad/
[23:04:27] <imode> if it's edible, you didn't fuck it up.
[23:04:36] <imode> never let the food win.
[23:04:37] <dimadima> they were fine, just a little thick
[23:04:55] <dimadima> he's a real defeatist kind of guy
[23:04:59] <dimadima> lol
[23:05:07] <dimadima> alway stuck with me though
[23:05:13] <dimadima> "just quit" who says that
[23:05:21] <dimadima> this is america
[23:05:34] <dimadima> if we quit we first cause global instability and kill a million people
[23:05:48] <dimadima> he has that old soviet mentality
[23:05:52] <riv> haha
[23:05:53] <imode> I had that mentality at quite a few points in my life.
[23:06:04] <dimadima> comrade imode
[23:06:15] <imode> in solidarity.
[23:06:50] <imode> thank god for the weekend. my head blew up.
[23:22:00] <indigo> > have a half hour to get this ship-shape and demoable.
[23:22:06] <indigo> That's when I usually reschedule the meeting
[23:22:07] <imode> 8 minutes, now.
[23:22:24] <gwozniak> good luck :)
[23:22:36] <imode> meh. like any good cooking show, I have a backup.
[23:22:57] <indigo> Nice!
[23:23:09] <gwozniak> oh cool.  I may have happened across an interesting dynamic programming solution to a rather tricky problem
[23:23:29] <gwozniak> crepes aren't too bad if you have a good pan
[23:23:31] <indigo> What??? Using dynamic programming in the real world
[23:23:41] <gwozniak> I know, right
[23:25:50] <gwozniak> Honestly, I was just printing some data from a simple analysis and it really looks like I might be able to use something like the Smith-Waterman algorithm to find the (optimal?) solution
[23:27:10] <indigo> Interesting
[23:27:13] <indigo> Is this for diffing?
[23:27:18] <gwozniak> And it would be used in the linker, just to make it more spicy
[23:27:41] <gwozniak> Trying to find and remove redundant stores in constant pools
[23:28:19] <gwozniak> Actually, I might be able to use it in the compiler.  Remains to be seen.
[23:28:35] <gwozniak> All to minimize code size
[23:31:55] <indigo> So basically trying to find constant literals that are dupes?
[23:32:54] <indigo> And I guess having it in the linker allows you to optimize space usage across the entire program
[23:34:38] <gwozniak> Yeah, that's the general idea.  You can do it in the compiler with LTO enabled if you don't care about libraries
[23:35:56] <gwozniak> Alright, research stuff is done for the day.  Time to muck around with some Makefile madness so I can build these IDE projects easily
[23:36:15] <gwozniak> I've got hundreds of projects, and I'm not firing up the IDE for each one
[23:36:30] <indigo> Sheesh
[23:37:01] <gwozniak> I prefer actual programs to benchmarks for this sort of thing
[23:37:41] <indigo> The constant pool optimization? That makes sense
[23:38:28] <gwozniak> I picked one small project based on FreeRTOS to get an idea and make the initial analysis easy.  Now I need to find one that's a lot bigger
[23:39:15] <imode> everything is broken~
[23:39:43] <gwozniak> I found one case where the same constant was stored twice in the same constant pool.  That was weird.
[23:39:54] <indigo> I still feel like this is something that should be done in the code; eg. the compiler + linker shouldn't be responsible for fixing what you forgot to `inline const` in your header
[23:40:44] <gwozniak> If the same constant is used across lots of compilation/translation units, then you might not be able to control it
[23:42:07] <gwozniak> And Arm (32-bit Arm, anyway) tends to put one constant pool per function because the instructions to load an address don't have a long range
[23:44:23] <indigo> Oh wow. So if you had a global constant defined, and used it in four functions within the same translation unit, it would get duplicated four times?
[23:45:51] <gwozniak> It's possible, yes.  The range on the 2-byte load is only 1020 bytes (must be word-aligned and can only reference forward) and the 4-byte version is 4095 bytes in either direction.
[23:46:57] <gwozniak> On v7-M, anyway.  I don't know what it's like on other architectures (v6-M is probably similar)
[23:48:04] <gwozniak> MIPS does it differently
[23:48:39] <gwozniak> You can likely get away with one global constant pool and a single base register on MIPS
[23:48:55] <gwozniak> It basically dedicates a register for that
[23:50:37] <gwozniak> Then you have the situation of -mpure-code on Arm where you can't even have a constant pool
[23:51:30] <gwozniak> Because there are regions of memory where the target of a read/load instruction is not legal.  It's execute only memory.
[23:52:48] <indigo> Right, IIRC the NX bit

[23:55:54] <gwozniak> I was wondering... :)
[23:57:29] <indigo> Stupid question: I was under the impression that you can load whatever 64-bit chunk you want to read from whatever memory address; surprised that 2-byte/4-byte loads have limits
[23:57:57] <indigo> (this is still about ARM)
[23:58:52] <indigo> Or is this like an offset load
[23:59:01] <indigo> Where you don't have to put the address in the register beforehand
