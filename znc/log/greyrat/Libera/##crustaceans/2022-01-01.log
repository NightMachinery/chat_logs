[00:12:00] <companion_cube> The little pink stripe that says positive on the covid test is "ü§ßüò•", no joke
[00:13:31] <bkero> companion_cube: At-home antigen test? Those are supposed to be a 2-part. There are some false negatives associated with them.
[00:13:55] <companion_cube> Yep, but very rare false positives, so we know she has it
[00:14:18] <bkero> There's a serial number-based thing to check, there was a batch known to produce false positives
[00:14:33] <bkero> I'm sorry if it ends up being true.

[07:14:00] <manicennui> They always have been though.
[07:14:05] <manicennui> They just got lucky with Firefox.
[07:15:10] <manicennui> My friend worked there for a while. They have no idea what they are doing.
[07:15:16] <manicennui> They survive because of the search box money
[07:23:14] <manicennui> Their strategy seemed to be "pay a lot of engineers a fuckton of money and hope something happens".
[07:31:10] <indigo> I feel like that‚Äôs every large tech company these days :P
[07:33:21] <manicennui> indigo: Nah.
[07:33:34] <manicennui> I mean they literally told the engineers to decide what to do.
[07:33:57] <manicennui> There was no real vision or direction other than keeping Firefox going, which was only a small part of what they worked on.
[07:37:16] <manicennui> Which I guess is fine if your goal is to come up with something like Rust every decade or so.
[07:38:29] <manicennui> It's interesting that their tiny market share still generates a good bit of revenue for the search box.
[07:39:13] <dminkovsky> indigo: yep did it all
[07:39:18] <dminkovsky> probably won't next year
[07:39:27] <dminkovsky> or will forget and do it again

[07:43:29] <indigo> Heheh
[08:00:07] <companion_cube> Rust makes it worth it I guess... But then they fired most of their rust people
[08:00:41] <manicennui> They are also basically irrelevant in the browser space.
[08:01:38] <manicennui> ~4% market share overall, and a rounding error on mobile.
[08:02:25] <imode> I'm a part of that 4% market share and I don't intend on giving it up lightly.
