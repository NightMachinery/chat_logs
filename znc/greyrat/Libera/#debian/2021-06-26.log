[02:52:19] <greycat> Generally speaking, start with Debian stable.  If it doesn't work on your hardware, google it, and maybe there will be clearly written workarounds.  If not, but Debian at least boots into console mode, try a backported kernel.
[02:52:31] <themachine> ^
[02:53:09] <themachine> I might have an interesting time with my framework once delivered. Never ran debian on something so new.
[02:53:28] <greycat> Right now, we're about a month away (guessing) from a new stable release, so you could also try Debian testing.  Not a path I would normally recommend, but *right now* it's fairly harmless.

[03:03:18] <greycat> I think the last thing I want to think about is some other crazy new network configuring apparatus.  Aren't there enough of them already?
[03:03:56] <sleepingforest> yes theres too many
[03:04:38] <sleepingforest> i used ubuntu images for a k8s cluster and struggled with systemd-resolved and nodelocaldns
[03:04:50] <randall> sleepingforest: netplan is only a generator for network-manager config. So just use network-manager.
[03:05:21] <randall> sleepingforest: Also, if you want to configure "cloud" instances, cloud-init provides a vendor-neutral way to do so. That's why netplan is pretty much dead.
[03:07:04] <sleepingforest> randall: thanks
[03:08:05] <jhutchins> I've worked with people who would do just about anything to convert a configuration file to yaml, no matter how much it complicated the process.
[03:08:05] <randall> sleepingforest: In the broader scope, netplan is just yet another tool that Canonical brought out that only really works on Ubuntu. Just like unity, snap, etc.
[03:08:30] <randall> jhutchins: If it is of any help, cloud-init also takes YAML :)
[03:08:36] <jhutchins> randall: I thought snap had metastisized.
[03:09:11] <sleepingforest> lol
[03:09:17] <randall> jhutchins: It only really works with Ubuntu as it needs kernel patches. snap e.g. Debian is completely useless as it offers no confinement.
[03:09:56] <randall> jhutchins: `snap run hello-world.evil` on Debian should be all you need to know.
