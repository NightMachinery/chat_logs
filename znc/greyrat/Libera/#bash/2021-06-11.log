[00:58:30] <timj> it's been over 20 years that I contributed to procps, around 1999ish... but i think i recall that back in the day there was no libprocps because it wasn't sure what would or would not reliably be exposed via /proc (and there was no /sys). so most useful tools that dealt with /proc went into the procps package to at least maintain them in the same place. also maintainership was neglected back then, mostly just handled by rotating package ma

[16:48:50] <mingdao> https://0x0.st/-Laa.txt
[16:49:39] <geirha> right, so bash is built with the retarded "source .bashrc even when non-interactive when run through ssh" feature
[16:49:44] <mingdao> What is the proper way to have up/down arrows scroll commands in history? 
[16:50:09] <geirha> that means you must add an interactive test at the start of your .bashrc, to bail out early.  [[ $- = *i* ]] || return 0
[16:50:56] <mingdao> Meaning, enter the first character of a previous command, such as ssh, then press the up arrow and it scrolls ~/.bash_history commands that started with ssh.
[16:51:16] <geirha> mingdao: those binds look right. It's failing because .bashrc got read when the shell was non-interactive
[16:51:29] <Soliton> you can put those bindings in your .inputrc if you want.
[16:51:32] <geirha> and the error messages it outputs messes with rsync
[16:52:23] <mingdao> Is this proper...where I added that line to .bashrc? https://0x0.st/-LaM.txt
[16:52:40] <Soliton> further up
[16:52:40] <geirha> no, add it at the top
[16:52:55] <mingdao> After # Source global definitions ?
[16:53:07] <geirha> there's no point in running anything in .bashrc when the shell is not interactive
[16:53:09] <mingdao> .inputrc: No such file or directory
[16:53:26] <mingdao> Would ↑ be a more appropriate file for this?
[16:54:06] <mingdao> All my ~/.bashrc and /root/.bashrc are so convoluted it's embarrassing.
[16:54:18] <Soliton> .inputrc is for readline stuff, yes. that is orthogonal to the other issue though.
[16:54:26] <mingdao> I've been a Linux daily user since 2003, but not a formal learner.  :/
[16:55:19] <mingdao> Can you explain orthogonal to the other issue?  Do you mean it applies to more than, or other than, the issue you addressed with my .bashrc?
[16:55:49] <Soliton> "has nothing to do with"
[16:56:03] <geirha> the bind vs inputrc stuff does not affect the rsync problem
[16:56:45] <mingdao> Should those bind lines be in .inputrc rather than .bashrc?
[16:57:03] <Soliton> they would look a bit different in .inputrc.
[16:57:13] <mingdao> I thought they were reading shell (bash) history, and didn't apply to other areas.
[16:57:29] *** Joins: somlis (~somlis@user/somlis)
[16:57:36] <geirha> the main difference is that if you put the bindings in .inputrc, other programs that use readline will also use that setting. Using bind command in .bashrc, it only applies to bash
[16:57:36] <Soliton> you would just put the part between single quotes in .inputrc.
[17:03:18] <mingdao> Pardon my ignorance, but by single quotes do you mean   [ $- = *i* ] || return 0   ?
[17:03:37] <Soliton> that was regarding the bind commands.
[17:03:53] * mingdao needs sleep
[17:04:38] <Soliton>  put that check at the top as geirha said and then rsync should be fixed. doesn't matter if you move the bind commands or not.

[18:45:53] <seabass> Hello!
[18:46:28] <seabass> I've been trying to remove all the bash history items ending with 'dt'
[18:46:36] <seabass> so I've written this command:
[18:46:39] <seabass> history | grep dt$ | cut -d' ' -f1 | xargs -n1 -I{} bash -c "history -d {}"
[18:47:24] <seabass> However, it fails with messages like "bash: line 0: history: 16424: history position out of range", which seems strange to me as I can successfully run the history command manually.
[18:48:00] <seabass> Any ideas? Thanks in advance :)

[18:53:18] <geirha> because once you remove a history entry, the remaining ones shift one position
[18:53:44] <seabass> ha, right'o
[18:53:48] <geirha> so after the first is removed, you're removing arbitrary other lines
[18:54:05] <seabass> every time I run it though, the same errors come up
[18:54:18] <seabass> line 17770, 16425, 20100, etc etc etc
[18:54:35] <geirha> one option is to remove them in reverse
[18:54:37] <seabass> I would have thought that the number of lines failing would decrease by 1 every time I run it?
[18:54:57] <Soliton> perhaps use a text editor instead of that crazy pipeline.
[18:55:04] <seabass> history | grep dt$ | cut -d' ' -f1 | sort -r | xargs -n1 -I{} bash -c "history -d {}" fails the same way
[18:55:05] <geirha> but, you're running history -d in a new, non-interactive shell with no history enabled
[18:55:14] <seabass> oh, right
[18:55:29] <seabass> hmm, so I need to load the history file and then save it back again after deleting?
[18:56:17] <geirha> mapfile -t ids < <(history | awk ...); history -d "${ids[@]}"
[18:56:32] <seabass> xargs -n1 -I{} bash -c "history -r && history -d {} && history -w" seems like it could work
[18:56:49] <Soliton> more shell injection...
[18:56:50] <geirha> mapfile -t ids < <(history | awk '/dt$/{print $1}'); history -d "${ids[@]}"
[18:57:04] <seabass> yikes, I don't know awk or mapfile :(
[18:57:50] <geirha> !mapfile

[18:58:12] <geirha> the awk just does the same as the grep and cut combined
[18:58:48] <seabass> geirha, thanks, that makes sense now
[19:00:08] <geirha> ah wait, history -d only takes one at a time, so will need to loop it in reverse instead

[19:01:55] <geirha> ah then it only does the last one ... *boggle*. loop it is

[19:02:28] <geirha> because xargs is not part of bash
