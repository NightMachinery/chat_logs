[00:54:01] <gwern> if the EU won't give you more than a year or few for running a DNM, how much do you think they give for money-laundering?
[00:54:22] <kuudes> yes, but personal debt remains, and is reposessable

I grew up 5 – 10 years after the war, and in the communist Hungary of the day many people who had played prominent roles before the war lost not only their livelihoods but even their homes: they were sent into “exile”. So I was taught at home by a former general, a count, a baroness and a former judge. They were excellent people, but in those days, they were deemed
[03:29:12] <feepbot> to be nobodies. So with my education I was exceptionally lucky: I couldn’t have had better people to tutor me. The judge was not allowed to remain in the judiciary, so he took up teaching. The general was pretty famous – he was the head of Hungarian fencing. Fencing was actually popular in Hungary for many years. This great-uncle of mine had the wonderful idea of setting up a
[03:29:12] <feepbot> Fencing Academy in the army, so that able recruits had a chance of being trained to be coaches, rather than go on mindless drills. Within a few years Hungary produced more coaches than the rest of the world put together.

[04:03:10] <quanticle> ggreer: Yeah, that's the dilemma I have with my next car: do I want a Tesla, even though I'm not really all that interested in any of the things that make the car distinctive, just for the superchargers?
[04:06:51] <shawwwn> of course you want a tesla
[04:06:58] <ggreer> I don't think the other EV manufacturers will have competitive charging networks for a long time
[04:07:01] <shawwwn> if someone gave one to you tomorrow, you'd be very happy
[04:07:13] <shawwwn> but you don't know whether you want to pay for it
[04:07:27] <gwern> how well do teslas handle minnesota? are they going to back you up in 10 years when the panels rust off?
[04:07:30] <ggreer> that said, tesla claims they'll be opening their charging network to non-teslas at some point in the future. no idea how much it'll cost or how quickly it'll charge though
[04:08:30] <shawwwn> TIL minnesota was founded after the civil war
[04:08:42] <shawwwn> oh wait
[04:08:46] <shawwwn> just before 
[04:09:09] <shawwwn> weird that new states were being founded just a century and some change ago
[04:09:24] <ggreer> IIRC, most of the exposed stuff like the suspension is aluminum. much of the frame is steel but it's covered by plastic
[04:09:25] *** Joins: Nivim (~Nivim@174-24-73-242.clsp.qwest.net)
[04:09:25] <shawwwn> not that minnesota is a particularly remarkable state
[04:09:34] <gwern> not a coincidence. adding new states was a major threat to the status quo pre-civil-wear
[04:09:51] <shawwwn> why?
[04:09:58] <gwern> because that was a senate vote
[04:10:07] <gwern> and another ratifier for amendments
[04:10:16] <gwern> * 2 senate votes, I should say
[04:10:33] <ggreer> the main issue with teslas in cold weather is reduced range, but you'll have that problem with all EVs
[04:10:48] <quanticle> Yeah, adding new states was hugely controversial in the mid-1800s because you had to add them two at a time
[04:10:51] <quanticle> One slave and one free
[04:11:09] <quanticle> And if you couldn't find a new slave state to add to pair off with the free state, the state just didn't get added
[04:11:25] <gwern> now we have the same problem, but dem/rep. even places that might make sense to add as states will never be added because it would disrupt the balance
[04:11:51] <quanticle> Yeah, like Puerto Rico, Washington DC or Central California
[04:11:54] <gwern> does washington dc want to be a state? well, maybe it could be. but it never will be as long as it continues voting like 90% dem in every election
[04:12:40] <saturn2> cars don't really rust much anymore, they solved that somehow
[04:12:52] <quanticle> As I keep reminding gwern, and he keeps disbelieving
[04:13:09] <gwern> all I know is that I saw a hell of a lot of rust the last time I was in the twin cities
[04:13:14] <quanticle> Even American cars don't rust that much any more
[04:13:26] <shawwwn> rust is a fun game
[04:13:35] <quanticle> Also a fun programming language
[04:13:39] <gwern> and sure, maybe tesla cars *shouldn't* rust, but they also shouldn't be mini-swimming pools for your groceries or steer themselves onto railroad tracks of their own volition
[04:13:49] <shawwwn> "fun"
[04:13:58] <shawwwn> rust is the modern template metaprogramming
[04:14:06] <shawwwn> the borrow checker is like crack for those people
[04:14:14] <ggreer> if you get a model s you shouldn't have rust issues. they're aluminum
[04:14:16] <quanticle> Nah, Rust error messages aren't nearly as opaque as C++
[04:14:19] <saturn2> there are still 90s cars rolling around that are full of rust holes, but rarely anything newer
[04:14:32] <shawwwn> that's true.
[04:14:50] <shawwwn> in fairness I'm not sure anything is as opaque as C++ error messages, except maybe some treatises on philosophy
[04:15:38] <quanticle> saturn2: The exception is pickup trucks, where you can tell the areas that get hit with kicked up pebbles by the fact that they start rusting
[04:16:03] <quanticle> shawwwn: NN idea: a transformer trained on Hegel and C++ error messages
[04:16:15] <shawwwn> lol.
[04:16:43] <gwern> quanticle: doesn't work, Transformers are too good and split it too easily. it'd generate pure hegel, or pure C++ error messages, not the mix of both you'd hope for
[04:16:47] <shawwwn> I think that's a good way to gather evidence for AGI to justify murdering us all
[04:17:10] <quanticle> gwern: Hmmm... are there any NN architectures that would have the intended effect?
[04:17:13] <gwern> quanticle: what you *could* try is text style transfer between hegel and C++ error messages
[04:17:17] <shawwwn> you'd be surprised
[04:17:26] <quanticle> Or C++ error messages to Hegel...
[04:17:28] <shawwwn> especially if it's underfit
[04:17:32] <gwern> quanticle: markov chains are so dumb they'd mash together the two corpuses. a bad char-RNN would also do it.
[04:17:36] <shawwwn> I wouldn't be surprised at all if it oscillated between the two
[04:17:52] <shawwwn> ah
[04:17:57] <shawwwn> I finally figured out what I wanted to eat
[04:17:59] <shawwwn> salad
[04:18:04] <gwern> I think something along the lines of my style parodies would work well
[04:18:08] <shawwwn> delicious romane lettuce
[04:18:17] <shawwwn> with shredded cheese, ranch, and bacon bits
[04:18:21] <gwern> I also linked that example of 'google login page error as written by shakespeare' from gpt-3 a few weeks ago
[04:19:46] <shawwwn> somehow I bought 6 things of bacon bits
[04:19:54] <shawwwn> I think my goal was never to run out of bacon bits again
[04:20:04] <shawwwn> and I didn't really think about it too carefully
[04:20:27] <shawwwn> also what are those called? canisters? but it's not a can
[04:20:31] <shawwwn> it's like a plastic... jar
[04:20:34] <shawwwn> but it's not a jar either
[04:20:42] <shawwwn> "container" seems like a cop out
[04:20:45] <gwern> why can't a jar be plastic?
[04:22:11] <quanticle> I think I raised this question, but with regard to jugs
[04:22:24] <quanticle> And the conclusion was that jugs can be plastic
[04:22:31] <quanticle> So I think the same principle applies to jars
[04:22:44] <shawwwn> jug sounds way larger than it is though
[04:22:59] <shawwwn> oh
[04:23:00] <shawwwn> I misread
[04:23:02] <shawwwn> yes
[04:23:11] <shawwwn> but jars are almost universally glass
[04:23:18] <ggreer> my guess is that tesla gets a ton of negative publicity compared to other car companies. a million BMWs get recalled because they catch on fire when sitting around? almost zero press about it. nissan propilot accelerates into a car directly in front of it? no press. ford bluecruise gets delayed again? crickets
[04:24:04] <ggreer> it looks like the nissan system only uses radar or something, and when the radar bounces off in a weird way it thinks "no obstacles in front" and hits the gas
[04:24:08] <PlanckWalk> Eh, people that try radically new stuff and fail are more interesting.
[04:24:10] <gwern> you say that but the CR surveys pretty consistently show that despite the owners' fanboyism, the repairs are awful
[04:24:48] <PlanckWalk> Also despite sensor fusion issues, single mode sensors suck.
[04:25:03] <shawwwn> more nn mainstream https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/rfqgia/here_the_result_of_me_mixing_the_actors_who/
[04:25:04] <ggreer> huh? CR says tesla has average reliability and recommends the model 3
[04:25:06] <PlanckWalk> Whether that single mode is camera or radar.
[04:25:16] <feepbot> Here the result of me mixing the actors who played anakin and Padma in artbreeder : StarWars (10,277 votes and 646 comments so far on Reddit)
[04:27:52] <gwern> (is that how faces work?)
[04:27:55] <ggreer> PlanckWalk: radar sounds like a good idea but it's not reliable. when you have a lock it's great. when you don't.... you're gonna have a bad time
[04:28:37] <ggreer> because it'll either say nothing is in front of you when something *is* in front of you and you'll crash, or it'll think there's an obstacle in front of you but it's just a metal sign above the road (and it'll slam on the brakes)
[04:28:47] <quanticle> Maybe they could introduce some kind of audio cue that indicates when you have a radar lock
[04:28:51] <quanticle> Like on fighter jets
[04:28:53] <quanticle> lol
[04:29:08] <ggreer> heh. these aren't phased array radars. they just send out a beam in a cone
[04:29:40] <quanticle> So it's like a Mig-21 radar; you can still get a growl
[04:29:51] <ggreer> so the only way to know if they're actually working is to confirm the data with vision or lidar
[04:30:05] <ggreer> and at that point you might as well just use vision or lidar because the radar is extra noise
[04:30:53] <quanticle> My dad's Honda has some kind of radar system for its adaptive cruise control and my dad hates it because it dies the moment there's any snow in the grille
[04:31:11] <quanticle> Whereas my Subaru uses binocular cameras and it works as long as the windshield is clear
[04:31:21] <ggreer> one annoying thing about reliability scores is they don't differentiate between drivetrain reliability and accessory reliability. if the tire pressure monitoring system fails that sucks, but it doesn't leave me stranded
[04:32:20] <quanticle> Is drivetrain reliability really a problem for anyone? My understanding is that when it comes to core components like engine, transmission, differentials, etc, pretty much all cars are solid these days
[04:32:38] <quanticle> The only place you see differences is in the accessories
[04:32:57] <ggreer> the mechanical parts are usually fine, but electrical issues in the engine/transmission/etc can disable a vehicle
[04:33:18] <ggreer> older BMWs are notorious for this
[04:33:53] <quanticle> Yeah, that's fair.
[04:34:12] <quanticle> A busted sensor can leave you stuck, even if the engine is mechanically fine
[04:35:41] <ggreer> I do remember that early roadsters had mechanical issues. the motor torque was so high that it was easy to blow up the transmission. IIRC that's what made tesla switch to a fixed gear transmission
[04:35:49] <ggreer> (early roadsters had two gears IIRC)
[04:36:14] <quanticle> Oh, speaking of powertrain reliability, one of my parents' friends has a Tesla Model 3, and he related a story where he was at a friends' house and he got a ping on his phone. He looked at it and it was from his Tesla, saying that it had detected a fault in the battery cooling system, a tow truck had been called, and he'd need another ride home.
[04:36:26] <quanticle> Oh, like the Porsche Taycan
[04:37:24] <ggreer> yeah. the taycan wanted quick acceleration and a high top speed

[12:45:39] <kuudes> I feel very disoriented currently because the authorities here feel insane
[12:45:46] <kuudes> I can lockdown my own family over the year end holidays, but I presume the system will break down during that time. I am currently preparing for the situation where we will not be getting resupplies because the delivery people and shopkeepers are ill. Tsunami feels rather accurate word. currently the sea is receding, and our society is saying "it is very mild, look at these nice seashells"
[12:46:32] <shawwwn> don't worry kuudes, it'll be alright
[12:46:34] * two2thehead hugs kuudes 
[12:46:58] <kuudes> it won't
[12:48:29] <shawwwn> you say that with remarkable assurance
[12:49:05] <kuudes> we won't have enough crematoriums to burn the dead
[12:49:21] <kuudes> I guess the frozen temps will keep the bodybags from smellling
[12:49:57] <two2thehead> at the risk of missing the point, are the crematoriums gas-powered?
[12:50:33] <two2thehead> I was reading up on biohazard disposal and apparently the ones the article mentioned are gas powered. Mildly interesting
[12:53:19] <shawwwn> it's actually really hard to burn a human body
[12:53:23] <shawwwn> it's mostly liquid 
[12:53:47] <shawwwn> so it's basically like trying to burn off ~200lbs of water
[12:53:53] <kuudes> the authorities here say "they'll have to take a look into norway's numbers" when norway predicts up to 900k infections per day
[12:54:33] <two2thehead> shawwwn, til
[12:54:39] <shawwwn> it'll be alright kuudes. You've been alright every day until now, so in all likelihood you'll be ok every day after
[12:56:06] <kuudes> thats turkey induction
[12:59:21] <kuudes> but thanks

[13:39:42] <PlanckWalk> Norway won't reach anywhere near 900k infections per day.  That's just stupid.
[13:40:22] <PlanckWalk> May as well say that the week after 900k infections per day, they'll hit 9M infections per day.
[13:41:13] <PlanckWalk> And everyone will catch a new case of COVID every day the week after that.

[14:10:12] <kuudes> it was not 900k but 300k btw
[14:10:15] <kuudes> 90k-300k
[14:10:38] <kuudes> and 300k*10 is 3M which is less than norway's population
[14:10:48] <kuudes> still more than half of the population
[14:11:10] <kuudes> it does not seem implausible for me that half of population would contract omicron in a week
[14:16:41] <PlanckWalk> 300k is vastly more plausible
[14:17:06] <kuudes> details are what matter
[14:17:08] <PlanckWalk> But still too high, because exponential growth is only a small-world approximation.
[14:17:26] <kuudes> at which day do you think exponential will turn to sigmoid?
[14:17:36] <PlanckWalk> I.e. where every person has *equal* chance of contacting every other person.
[14:17:46] <PlanckWalk> kuudes: Already doing it.
[14:18:07] <kuudes> oh?
[14:18:09] <PlanckWalk> But even that's wrong
[14:18:21] <PlanckWalk> There are not just two choices "exponential" and "sigmoid"
[14:18:36] <PlanckWalk> Sigmoid usually refers to a curve symmetric about its inflection point

[14:19:25] <Robomot> image/png (1049x590; 43 KB)
[14:19:38] <PlanckWalk> Yep, and that's obviously not exponential.
[14:19:39] <kuudes> at which day do you feel the blue line will cross the yellow line?
[14:19:47] <kuudes> ?
[14:20:05] <PlanckWalk> What does it mean by "limit"?
[14:20:14] <kuudes> please elaborate on "obviously not exponential"?
[14:20:28] <PlanckWalk> Exponential on a long-linear graph is a straight line
[14:20:29] <kuudes> the limit is "the same delayed by 2 days"
[14:20:33] <kuudes> yes.
[14:20:37] <PlanckWalk> It has a section that looks exponential
[14:20:37] <kuudes> log linear
[14:20:54] <kuudes> yes.
[14:20:55] <PlanckWalk> Preceded by a section with *much greater* slope.
[14:21:03] <kuudes> at some point it will turn away from exponential
[14:21:08] <kuudes> the question is when
[14:21:17] <kuudes> and given omicron's growth rate, the day matters
[14:21:46] <kuudes> it must turn away from exponential at one day of this week for us not to get to those tens or hundreds of thousands of new infections per day
[14:21:49] <kuudes> so. which day?
[14:21:56] <PlanckWalk> Tat's bullshit
[14:22:32] <PlanckWalk> Also you're moving the goalpost
[14:22:38] <kuudes> no
[14:22:40] <PlanckWalk> The goalpost was "300k per day"
[14:22:49] <kuudes> "<kuudes> which day do you presume exponential will stop and s-curve will start?" was my first line
[14:22:49] <PlanckWalk> Now it's "tens or hundreds of thousands of new infections per day"
[14:22:57] <kuudes> 90k-300k was said
[14:23:08] <kuudes> which is tens of thousands - hundreds of thousandsd
[14:23:12] <kuudes> quite literally.
[14:23:29] <PlanckWalk> You first said 600k per day, then 300k, then 90-300k
[14:23:38] <kuudes> where have I said 600k per day?
[14:23:43] <kuudes> I don't see such in my logs
[14:23:56] <PlanckWalk> Typo.  900k
[14:24:00] <kuudes> you might want to reread the conversation, it seems you are making things up
[14:24:25] <kuudes> "<kuudes> it was not 900k but 300k btw"
[14:24:36] <PlanckWalk> < kuudes> the authorities here say "they'll have to take a look into norway's numbers" when norway predicts up to 900k infections per day
[14:24:46] <PlanckWalk> Yes, which is exactly my point.
[14:24:54] <PlanckWalk> 900k -> 300k -> 90k-300k
[14:25:02] <PlanckWalk> It keeps goign down.  What next, 9k?
[14:25:15] <kuudes> ah, nice, you are correct, indeed I said so there. thanks
[14:26:12] <PlanckWalk> I'm fine with it reaching 90k, and could plausibly stretch to 300k.
[14:26:15] <kuudes> that was indeed an error of me. norway's authorities have predicted 90k-300k. but as now I am uncertain, I will check it once more
[14:28:58] <nshepperd> if i take this exponential extrapolation at face value, they will reach 300k per day after about 300-400k total cases

[14:30:03] <nshepperd> or 6%ish of the population
[14:30:12] <kuudes> my norska is bad but I think that says for 3 weeks new daily infections between 90000 and 300000 per day
[14:30:14] <nshepperd> seems somewhat possible
[14:31:19] <PlanckWalk> I do predict that the Denmark graph will have already have notably departed from that red line before Dec 26th.
[14:31:55] <PlanckWalk> I.e. 90k won't happen before Christmas.
[14:31:57] <kuudes> on which day
[14:32:49] <PlanckWalk> DOn't care
[14:32:51] <kuudes> https://i.imgur.com/rMBahDr.png before what day blue line in your opinion will be lower than yellow line? https://i.imgur.com/rMBahDr.png

[14:33:07] <kuudes> ok if you don't care of the topic of conversation, please shut up?
[14:33:15] <PlanckWalk> I don't care abotu *the exact day*
[14:33:26] <PlanckWalk> So you can shut up.
[14:33:29] <kuudes> before what day?
[14:33:39] <PlanckWalk> <PlanckWalk> I.e. 90k won't happen before Christmas.
[14:33:43] <kuudes> you have voiced before 2021-12-24. ok
[14:33:46] <kuudes> that won't help much
[14:33:53] <nshepperd> there is no exact day bc departure from the exp approximation is continuous
[14:33:58] <PlanckWalk> Yep
[14:34:06] <kuudes> nshepperd, yes, which is why I drew a limit
[14:34:18] <kuudes> so that such difference of opinion can be quantified
[14:34:45] <kuudes> if one is sure there won't be but 10000k infections, then it must be 2021-12-18
[14:34:47] <nshepperd> that doesn't really help
[14:34:53] <kuudes> that is, before this saturday
[14:35:02] <kuudes> so within next 4 days.
[14:35:11] <PlanckWalk> 10000k infections?  In a country with population 5500k?
[14:35:22] <kuudes> 10000 infections. yes you are correct
[14:35:32] <PlanckWalk> Oh sure, it will definitely hit 10k per day
[14:35:39] <kuudes> no, total
[14:35:49] <kuudes> this is total infections so far
[14:35:56] <PlanckWalk> Then even more so.
[14:35:57] <kuudes> per day is derivative of this
[14:36:03] <kuudes> ok.
[14:36:05] <kuudes> 100k?
[14:36:08] <PlanckWalk> Sure
[14:36:33] <kuudes> 100k infections means crudely 1000 persons into hospital
[14:36:45] <kuudes> 100k will happen at 2021-12-22
[14:36:53] <kuudes> so in 8 days from now
[14:37:41] <PlanckWalk> Wouldn't surprise me
[14:37:57] <kuudes> vaccinations lower it somewhat, 20% unvaccinated -> 200 persons to hospital; of vaccinated 800 potential, 1/3 = 266, so total 466 to hospital
[14:38:53] <kuudes> and at 2021-12-24 and 2021-12-25 there will happen 100k infections in a day
[14:39:14] <kuudes> so each of them will produce 466 persons to seek hospital
[14:39:23] <kuudes> so. which day before that it will stop
[14:39:39] <kuudes> you predict between 2021-12-24 and 2021-12-22, so that is 2021-12-23?
[14:39:47] <kuudes> you had a day actually after all? :)
[14:40:21] <kuudes> you believe it is impossible to go on after 2021-12-24 but believe it is clearly plausible up to 2021-12-22
[14:40:22] <PlanckWalk> kuudes: Eh, I don't think that fast by 25th
[14:40:28] <kuudes> look at the chart
[14:40:38] <kuudes> subtract from day's total the previous day's total
[14:40:42] <PlanckWalk> <PlanckWalk> I.e. 90k (per day) won't happen before Christmas.
[14:40:57] <PlanckWalk> (I just added the per day since our context has changed)
[14:42:25] <kuudes> at each day, you will get new infections, was it about 1/3 of *total* infections that have happened that far (I have to check the 1/3)
[14:42:31] <kuudes> that is the nature of exponentials
[14:42:42] <PlanckWalk> Yes, for the period in which they continue being exponential.
[14:42:54] <PlanckWalk> (To some suitable margin of approximation)
[14:43:24] <kuudes> 45%
[14:43:27] <kuudes> yes
[14:43:37] <kuudes> which is why I am asking, when does it differ from exponential
[14:43:43] <PlanckWalk> Always, technically.
[14:43:57] <kuudes> yes, which is why I said when do you think it will go lower than the yellow line.
[14:44:03] <kuudes> so it is objective.
[14:44:13] <kuudes> at some point it will go lower than yellow line. and that is what matters.
[14:44:23] <kuudes> but stop being aggressive.
[14:44:28] <nshepperd> why does the yellow line matter
[14:44:31] <PlanckWalk> I have no idea.
[14:44:36] <nshepperd> it seems kind of arbitrary to me
[14:45:00] *** Quits: paul0 (~paul0@user/paul0) (Remote host closed the connection)
[14:46:54] <PlanckWalk> I'd be pretty happy saying 27th or earlier.
[14:46:55] <kuudes> nshepperd, it is the same line for x-2 day
[14:47:12] <kuudes> it is there that we can agree "it has ceased to be classified as exponential"
[14:47:34] <kuudes> ie clearly it is not exponential when it has differed from the red line to go under yellow line
[14:47:44] <PlanckWalk> Probably somewhat more weight to earlier.
[14:49:17] *** Quits: nanotube (~nanotube@user/nanotube) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[14:49:19] <kuudes> so, you are predicting it indeed may have at least 50k days
[14:49:56] <PlanckWalk> Sure!  I already said so.
[14:50:23] <PlanckWalk> <PlanckWalk> I'm fine with it reaching 90k, and could plausibly stretch to 300k.
[14:51:17] <kuudes> at each day, the red line grows as much as the yellow line's value was the day before (or the red line's value was in two days before)
[14:51:39] <kuudes> ok. we are then in agreement
[14:52:16] <kuudes> 90000 * 0.46% = 9*46 = 414 persons to hospital per day
[14:52:37] <kuudes> 300_000 * 0.46% = 300*46 = 13800 persons to hospital per day
[14:52:39] <kuudes> for weeks
[14:53:05] <kuudes> hmm, recheck
[14:53:25] <kuudes> 1380 persons per day is the latter value.
[14:54:18] <kuudes> norway has 3,53 hospital beds per person
[14:54:33] <kuudes> 5.5M population
[14:54:54] <kuudes> not per person
[14:55:03] <kuudes> per 1000 persons
[14:55:23] <kuudes> so 19500 hospital beds
[14:56:02] <kuudes> I guess the lower end of 90k/day scenario is survivable for them, in 300k/day scenario they will overflow
[14:56:21] <kuudes> wait, no
[14:57:06] <kuudes> yeah, in 90k/day infection scenario they will get in 21 days 8694 bed demands, in 300k/d in 21 days they will get 28980 bed demands
[15:01:32] <PlanckWalk> I guess that scenario depends upon how long they stay in hospital
[15:01:50] <PlanckWalk> (and well, the actual rate of hospitalization, which very likely has a lrger error margin)
[15:09:27] <kuudes> uk has presumed 0.5% for them currently apparently, which would fit to the earlier discussion of 0.47%

[18:51:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I started to think differently about my work. In 2007 at the Seward Projects Space in Columbus, I had my first breakthrough with an installation that was to be the prototype for this current one. It was called THE PUNCH-YOU-IN-THE-FACE TUNNEL. It was the same set-up as THE RAPE TUNNEL except at the end of the tunnel I’d punch the subject in the face instead of raping him or her. The impetus was completely reactionary to the
[18:51:17] <Obormot\Arcturus>  current state of art, and motivated by pure frustration.
[18:51:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> "As it turns out, I ended up breaking the nose of the third person to crawl through the tunnel, an aspiring model. She went to the hospital and eventually sued me. Her modeling career was put on hold. The civil case was long and drawn out and the matter still hasn’t been resolved. To this day she still has unpaid medical bills. The point of this long aside is that all this took place two years ago, and I’m still having an
