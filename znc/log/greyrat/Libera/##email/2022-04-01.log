[00:58:10] <Baphomet> Hello! I have the domains X and Y hosted on a shared hosting service... I manage the DNS for those domains (within certain boundaries), and I want to add a secondary SMTP services for sending mail only (for high priority e-mails, low traffic but I must assure deliverability)... I can request a change for the FQDN of the VPS so they match (I don't
[00:58:10] <Baphomet> know what to do about aliases, though)... 
[00:58:35] <Baphomet> I'm quite confused about what I need to do to ensure good deliverability

[01:11:48] <rob0> yw
[01:24:18] <Baphomet> Also, considering I'm not gonna receive e-mails through this MTA, can I keep the SMTP port available only for a small set of IPs?
[01:24:39] <Baphomet> Or would that be a problem?

[01:36:29] <rob0> I'd use submission or submissions, not smtp (25).
[01:37:10] <rob0> but sure, it only needs to be open to those who will be submitting legit mail.
[02:00:05] <jaybe> what is the proper way to go about keeping people from connecting to 25 and claiming their mail From: is within a domain in control by the server itself they're submitting to?

[02:03:31] <jaybe> with postfix, i found an smtpd_* access list for 25 and separation (of course) with submission.  requires keeping a list of legit domains that 'outsiders' can't 'send on behalf of'. seems there would be a simpler way.
[02:03:43] <rob0> If you force all your users to use submission (just don't offer nor accept AUTH on 25) you can use a check_sender_access lookup
[02:03:55] <jaybe> already have that scenario
[02:04:00] *** Quits: rgrinberg (~textual@177.248.156.216) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[02:04:11] <rob0> and it could simply recycle the lookups you have to define your own domains
[02:04:25] <jaybe> with regex or a variable?
[02:04:51] <rob0> maybe see reject_unlisted_sender also
[02:05:30] <jaybe> just seems a pain to go in and maintain another list of domains in a hardcoded fashion
[02:06:09] <jaybe> then again, allows finegrain controls too
[02:06:12] <rob0> so do it some other way
[02:06:28] <jaybe> this seems the 'correct' way according to the docs, so far anyway
[02:06:48] <rob0> well, you know your config, I do not
[02:07:03] <rob0> I use sqlite3 to define my domains
[02:07:10] <jaybe> seems like there would be a way to check ones own spf alone and realize it shouldn't be allowing some anon connection to 25 to spoof from:
[02:07:26] <jaybe> the db doesn't really matter
[02:07:33] <rob0> so I just use a different query to do a check_sender_access lookup
[02:07:35] <jaybe> s/db/storage format/
[02:07:48] <jaybe> you still have to populate the values ;)
[02:07:55] <rob0> no
[02:08:21] <rob0> select "reject" where ...
[02:08:51] <jaybe> ... where... if a value you've placed in the table (a domain) exists …
[02:09:07] <rob0> that's how SQL works, yes
[02:09:12] <jaybe> that's how data works yes
[02:09:25] <jaybe> you still must choose and submit a value into the table
[02:09:31] <jaybe> just as i submit into the text file and postmap it
[02:09:35] <jaybe> this is semantic
[02:11:16] <rob0> select "reject" from domains where domain is "%s" and class=1 and active=1;
[02:11:40] <rob0> is sort of how it works in my schema
[02:19:11] <Habbie> in sqlite, i strongly suggest never using "" for anything
[02:19:16] <Habbie> '' for values, `` for keys
[02:19:34] <Habbie> "" has this magic fallback mode where it tries to match a key and otherwise tries to fall back to a value
[02:20:07] <Habbie> well, tries, that almost always succeeds :)
[02:35:23] <rob0> oh
[02:35:48] <rob0> you're probably right, I was just going from faulty memory
[02:36:40] <rob0> and mixing up bash et al, where you can't have a variable in ''
[02:55:26] <Baphomet> !submission
[02:55:28] <dig-dug> Baphomet: submission: 587 is submission, for user submission of mail, NOT suitable for mail exchange. See !msa, and rfc 6409. Also read http://www.maawg.org/sites/maawg/files/news/MAAWG_Port25rec0511.pdf.
[03:02:18] <Baphomet> rob0: can I use submission encrypted? I'm not quite getting the difference here... I was thinking about using SMTPS... Is submission kind of a different protocol? 
[03:02:50] <rob0> oh you absolutely would require STARTTLS for submission
[03:03:04] <rob0> submissions is what you are calling smtps
[03:03:14] <rob0> !smtps
[03:03:16] <dig-dug> rob0: smtps: RFC 8314 renames the old smtps port, 465/tcp, to submissions, with implicit TLS rather than explicit STARTTLS via a plaintext TCP connection. Postfix can implement submissions with a separate smtpd(8) listener with \" -o smtpd_tls_wrappermode=yes\". See the commented example for smtps in master.cf.
[03:03:36] <jaybe> submission = starttls (typically) (587);  smtps = explicit tls (non starttls) (465)
[03:03:57] <rob0> no implicit
[03:04:04] <jaybe> ah thanks
[03:04:30] <rob0> meaning that the TLS is negotiated at connect time, rather than explicitly requested
[03:06:02] <jaybe> weird; while i get what you state - and comprehend and agree with it - it still feels weird. 'explicit' seems more ultimately accurate when comparing. shrug
[03:07:03] <rob0> yeah, to me it makes sense, "implicit" meaning it's implied, always there, not optional
[03:11:41] <Baphomet> Ohhh, sure, that's what I meant, but I'm a bit of a dinossaur LOL, glad to know then

[03:45:32] <Baphomet> What would you say about dovecot and cyrus? 
[03:45:57] <Baphomet> In terms of picking them
[03:46:14] <jaybe> with zero hesitation, dovecot
[03:46:29] <jaybe> !sasl
[03:46:30] <dig-dug> jaybe: sasl: SASL is 'Simple Authentication and Security Layer', necessary for SMTP, IMAP and POP3 AUTH and used for authentication to other protocols.
[03:46:52] <jaybe> rel: http://www.postfix.org/SASL_README.html
[03:47:24] <jaybe> …"NOTE: People who go to the trouble of installing Postfix may have the expectation that Postfix is more secure than some other mailers. The Cyrus SASL library contains a lot of code. With this, Postfix becomes as secure as other mail systems that use the Cyrus SASL library. Dovecot provides an alternative that may be worth considering."…
[03:49:52] <rob0> ^^ Wietse's words
[03:50:10] <Baphomet> I'm reading this one as of this moment, but hard to pick LOL
[03:50:43] <jaybe> it is?
[03:50:50] <jaybe> how is it difficult to pick at this point?
[03:51:00] <Baphomet> So cyrus? 
[03:51:06] <rob0> huh?  No
[03:51:07] <jaybe> if you so choose
[03:51:35] <jaybe> i get sarcasm even through utf-8 and over great distances sometimes
[03:51:40] <rob0> it's more difficult and more likely to have problems
[03:51:48] <rob0> ohhhh
[03:51:49] <jaybe> surely they're trollolol'ing
[03:51:56] <jaybe> and if not, let them syrus
[03:51:57] <jaybe> haha
[03:51:57] <Baphomet> I don't get sarcasm pretty well, sorry
[03:52:23] <jaybe> Baphomet: we are saying- without saying it- that dovecot may be a better choice. the AUTHOR of postfix said this. i quoted it for you above. ^^^
[03:52:32] <rob0> I had a rough day at work, so my sarcasm detector suffers from sarchasm (a gap between me and understanding)
[03:52:40] <jaybe> LOL
[03:52:50] * jaybe immediately whiteboards sarchasm
[03:53:17] <Baphomet> Okay... But how did you arrive at the conclusion that the author is recommending dovecot from that text? I totally don't get it
[03:53:32] <Baphomet> I mean, it presented options, barely covered dovecot
[03:53:33] <jaybe> what does the text state, in summary?
[03:53:54] <Baphomet> That postfix becomes secure due to cyrus?
[03:54:00] <jaybe> try again
[03:54:19] <Baphomet> Ohhhhhh, got it
[03:54:27] <Baphomet> as secure as other mail systems
[03:54:37] <Friithian> I recommend dovecot as I use it and it was easy to set up and haven't used the other one 
[03:54:39] <Baphomet> Like, with cyrus it stops being secure?
[03:54:47] <rob0> well, *I* prefer Dovecot because it's simple and easy and I'm running it anyway
[03:54:48] <jaybe> "...The Cyrus SASL library contains a lot of code. With this, Postfix becomes as secure as other mail systems that use the Cyrus SASL library. Dovecot provides an alternative that may be worth considering."..."
[03:54:59] <jaybe> Baphomet: here:   "use dovecot."
[03:55:52] <jaybe> rob0: thanks; now i'm scouring for domains i don't need within the 'sarchasm' realm
[03:56:00] <Baphomet> I'm autistic, if you're telling me I believe you
[03:56:02] <Baphomet> LOL
[03:56:11] <jaybe> everyone is
[03:56:19] <jaybe> dovecot is a wise choice
[03:56:22] <jaybe> got that?
[03:56:38] <Baphomet> Yes, now I got
[03:56:45] <jaybe> excellent :)
[03:58:24] <jaybe> it's challenging to not "put down" one thing and then promote another because it's inherently kind of 'rude' and disrespectful. it's being said though - that the first thing is really big and scary and has had some problems ... and that the other thing (dovecot) is lighter, newer, well-maintained, etc.  a preference is being shown for dovecot as the choice.
[04:00:24] <Baphomet> Excellent reasoning jaybe, congrats
[04:01:08] <jaybe> aside, dovecot is really, really awesome hehe
[04:01:16] <jaybe> wonderful amazing gift to the planet frankly
[04:01:36] <jaybe> without it, there'd be unhappiness and loss felt hard and heavy.
[04:06:44] <Baphomet> Sounds cool lol
[04:07:42] <Baphomet> Hyyy, another question, what approach should I follow to treat literally all recipients as non-local (since I'm not delivering)
[04:08:08] <Baphomet> I mean, I only plan to connect there to send mails, not to receive
[04:09:22] <jaybe> i think it would help for you to restate your question more simply - and only including what you wish to achieve - and not how you think you need to get there

[05:36:20] <thumbs> so a null client
[05:38:30] <rob0> right, but maybe not through a relay
[05:56:40] <pj> What they are talking about seems moe like a submission server than a null client to me.
[05:57:04] <thumbs> hrm
[05:57:15] <pj> so yeah, postfix is more appropriate in this case, imo.
[05:59:31] <pj> Baphomet: yeah, you'll want Postfix configured with port 25 disabled and submission(s) enabled.  You'll want Dovecot to act as the SASL backend and can disable IMAP and POP3 services (and you don't need to use it as a mailstore, unless you want to)...
[06:00:56] <pj> then just don't configure any local, virtual or relay domains in Postfix, then all mail will go out to the internet, including mail you send to yourself.
