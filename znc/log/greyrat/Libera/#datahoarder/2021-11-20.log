[00:23:19] <xMopx> this seems like a good price, is it? https://www.ebay.com/itm/255235435210
[00:23:43] <xMopx> i7-6700 thinkcenter mini with 16gb ram and 256gb ssd for $270
[00:24:02] <xMopx> and windows but lol
[00:24:55] <rawktucc> could do better
[00:26:28] <xMopx> how much better, do you think?
[00:26:43] <sarnold> for a small moment I thought that was 256gb ram system for $270 ..
[00:26:49] <evilgohan2> xMopx: that's about in line for those units
[00:27:14] <evilgohan2> similarly, for reference: https://computers.woot.com/offers/dell-optiplex-3040-micro-desktop-2?ref=w_cnt_wp_1_2
[00:27:40] <evilgohan2> i5-6400T / 16GB / 256GB for $319.99 + tax
[00:27:47] <evilgohan2> so yeah, that's not bad at all.
[00:27:57] <evilgohan2> Though, I don't know what your purpose will be.
[00:28:14] <evilgohan2> I've used those machines in the past to make Hackintoshes, and 6th gen Skylake was always a pain in the ass on that front.
[00:28:23] <evilgohan2> but Windows / Linux were fine.
[00:28:49] <rawktucc> xMopx, I mean I would aim for a ryzen machine personally
[00:28:59] <rawktucc> there's really no reason anyone should buy an intel system used or new outside of a laptop
[00:29:07] <rawktucc> because of the spectre/etc mitigations
[00:29:33] <rawktucc> xMopx, is your goal the form factor?
[00:29:42] <evilgohan2> SPECTRE affected AMD as well.
[00:30:00] <rawktucc> Yes, but not as heavily as Intel CPUs
[00:30:08] <xMopx> rawktucc: im trying to hit the trifecta - cheap, small, and low power consumption 
[00:30:10] <rawktucc> because Intel was Spectre AND meltdown, plus even more new stuff
[00:30:16] <rawktucc> xMopx, why not a pi then?
[00:30:21] <xMopx> ive got several i3-6000 series nucs from awhile ago and ive been pretty happy with then
[00:30:22] <rawktucc> or an o-droid
[00:30:27] <xMopx> rawktucc: not THAT low power :)
[00:30:27] <evilgohan2> SPECTRE literally affected everything: AMD / ARM / Intel
[00:30:37] <xMopx> raspi just doesnt have enough muscle 
[00:30:42] <rawktucc> mooscles
[00:31:29] <evilgohan2> for reference: https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Meltdown-Spectre-comparison-table.png
[00:31:53] <evilgohan2> Also, Ryzen availability in the MFF space is extremely limited, and at significantly higher cost.
[00:31:58] <evilgohan2> Intel is fine.
[00:31:58] <rawktucc> Yeah, so intel takes double the hits 
[00:31:59] <rawktucc> MFF?
[00:32:03] <evilgohan2> Micro Form Factor
[00:32:25] <rawktucc> oh
[00:32:30] <evilgohan2> what they linked. See also: Dell MFF Optiplex units, Lenovo micro units, HP 800-G2 (and such), Mac Mini
[00:32:37] <rawktucc> I know we've procured Lenovos with Ryzen mff
[00:32:42] <rawktucc> we definitely have somehow
[00:32:45] <rawktucc> or those were laptops maybe
[00:32:47] <evilgohan2> oh yeah, Lenovo is pretty much the only one
[00:32:50] <evilgohan2> and they're expensive af
[00:32:52] <rawktucc> Somehow lenovo is the only one making prebuilts with ryzen
[00:32:54] <evilgohan2> powerful
[00:32:56] <evilgohan2> but expensive
[00:32:57] <rawktucc> yes
[00:33:06] <xMopx> once those get into the used market and the price drops, those look sick
[00:33:10] <rawktucc> they're the only ones making laptops with ryzen CPUs that aren't dodgy
[00:33:35] <rawktucc> im flip flopping between a used x240 and one of the new x13s (ryzen). yes I know the x240 is intel but i've found uber cheap units for sale
[00:33:37] <evilgohan2> that's what this person used ,get https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/oi1f1i/m75q2_tiny_based_home_cluster/

[00:42:51] <evilgohan2> used to be,  when I didn't need one, I could go on craigslist and see racks for free, or less than $100 - with the only caveat that the buyer had to pick it up and transport it themselves.

[05:21:39] <rawktucc> salmon rsync/rclone yes but i dont think they support resume
[05:21:52] <rawktucc> let's say I have a 100GB file and my internet cuts out or the connection dies... waste of time then
[05:22:02] <rawktucc> also is there something better than sftp 
[05:22:08] <rawktucc> just ssh to ssh over rclone?
[05:26:19] <evilgohan2> rsync does support resume
[05:26:33] <rawktucc> what about rclone? I need crypt
[05:27:17] <evilgohan2> so use rsync lol
[05:28:10] <evilgohan2> rsync can use ssh transparently

[05:28:33] <evilgohan2> or use a tunnel
[05:28:40] <evilgohan2> or roll a vpn or something
[05:28:44] <evilgohan2> you've got options!
[05:28:46] <rawktucc> but rsync doesn't support encrypted files at rest :(
[05:28:53] <rawktucc> that's really the only problem where rclone shines
[05:29:20] <rawktucc> even if the zfs partitions are encrypted, the files should be encrypted at rest anyway
[05:29:39] <salmon> encrypt them with something other that what you're transferring with

[20:49:54] <Hawker> How do you guys sort everything? I'm at a point where I might try organizing everything, and developing some sort of sorting system but I want to know how you do it first.
[20:59:16] <x10> pretty simple directory structure works for me
[21:02:06] <Hawker> like what is that structure?
[21:02:50] <Hawker> Like /fiction/computers/python/tutorials/source ?
[21:03:13] <Hawker> or is it just a directory with basically tarballs everywhere?
[21:05:26] <x10> mostly media, so movies in /movies/name (year), tv in /tv/name, books in /books/author/(series if it is one)/name, newspapers go in /newspaper/name/year/month/day.pdf, comics go into /comics/[A..Z]/name
[21:05:49] <Hawker> Gotcha
[21:05:50] <x10> personal photo's goes in /photo/year/month/
[21:06:28] <x10> youtube channels go into their own /youtube/channelname/ etc
[21:07:38] <x10> software goes into /soft/os/installer or soft/os/iso
[21:07:48] <x10> simple
