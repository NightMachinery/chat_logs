[00:57:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Because it'll be able to compact & properly release memory back to the system.
[00:57:18] <bpalmer> why would it, though?
[00:58:01] <Odin-> Aurora_v_kosmose: Electron seems to _start_ at the hundreds of megabytes level. I don't think I've ever gotten emacs there, outside of intentionally messing with it.
[00:58:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> bpalmer: Use more memory than Electron? If you accidentally open some media file with dired that you didn't mean to. It'll keep the memory in libc cache.
[00:58:51] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The current GC effectively ensures Emacs only stays the same or increases. Never goes down.

[01:00:52] <artefact> "memory fragmentation? we'll let the kernel deal with it"
[01:00:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> bpalmer: Because you might have a low amount of system memory where it would matter.
[01:01:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> For example, my shitty 4GB memory laptop certainly had me care if Emacs bloated over 600MB because I opened the wrong file.

[01:10:48] <Bayes> this is a question that might seem too simple so sorry in advance, but can I connect to my organization google mail to read and send emails from emacs without downloading all the thousand emails I ever received?

[01:11:39] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Bayes: I know it's possible to only download email manifest over IMAP without downloading the actual emails, and loading them on demand, but I'm not sure how to set that up anymore.
[01:12:01] <Catie> I actually just did that through Gnus! It was pretty mediocre
[01:12:16] <Bayes> mediocre? as in... slow?
[01:12:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It had some performance issues when I tried that convinced me mirroring was the way to go.
[01:12:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Such as Gnus most definitely not supporting concurrency.
[01:12:28] <tromey> I use gnus all the time, it's fine
[01:12:40] <Bayes> I don't think I've ever use it to look up old stuff, I can always use the web client to do that
[01:12:45] <tromey> gnus used to be bad at this but at some point Lars rewrote the imap handler to be good
[01:12:56] <Bayes> more like reading latest emails and writing from emacs
[01:12:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I later learned that Gnus also supports using a local mirror/download of your emails just fine.
[01:13:11] <tromey> I went the other way and used to fetch everything, but now use imap
[01:13:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> tromey: Wait, so it's no longer freeze-the-world email fetching?
[01:13:44] <Catie> I switched to mutt but author my emails using Emacs. I like my setup a lot
[01:13:46] <acdw> i know some people install an imap server on their local machine just to use gnus
[01:13:49] <acdw> seems like a lot
[01:13:55] <tromey> no it still freezes, it just isn't super slow
[01:14:04] <tromey> it'd be better if gnus were really async but it's not
[01:14:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> acdw: I just use offlineimap & mpop depending on accounts.
[01:14:27] <Bayes> I mean maybe I could only mirror recent emails to avoid downloading the whole thing?
[01:14:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Although I use mu4e, the same principle applies.
[01:14:33] <Bayes> also how painful is it to mirror everything?
[01:14:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Bayes: That's possible. I know that offlineimap supports applying filters to what you sync, I'm not sure if it has something for dte.
[01:15:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Bayes: offlineimap is fairly slow. Its replacement is much faster but the Debian-packaged version is old and somewhat buggy.
[01:16:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Guix's version of mbsync/isync is probably fine, but I don't want to install Guix on every computer & vm instance I have. Just some of them.

[04:58:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I have it at t but I've never noticed any of the behavior you mention in there.
[04:58:19] <Unicorn_Princess> in prog-mode, it won't let you indent further if it thinks its correctly indented
[04:58:32] <Unicorn_Princess> it drove me crazy the last few days
[04:58:37] <Lycurgus> emacs is all deranged senile stuffs innit?
[04:58:46] <bpalmer> Unicorn_Princess: I rarely indent in text mode. When I do, it's often bullet points or the like, and that does the "right" thing
[04:58:51] <Common-Lisp> Unicorn_Princess: that prog-mode behavior is one of the reasons I originally switched to emacs 
[04:59:04] <Common-Lisp> emacs handling indentation all on its own is a killer app in my mind 
[04:59:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Disabling it makes no different in elisp mode for me.
[04:59:37] <bpalmer> Unicorn_Princess: as I mentioned the other day, modes handle their own indentation, so it's hard to talk about universal indentation across many modes.
[04:59:40] <wgreenhouse> electric-indent is just about whether entering a newline also indents with RET, ot whether you need C-j for that
[04:59:58] <wgreenhouse> the rest of the major mode specific indentation is major mode specific
[05:00:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If I'm not using paredit handle it, I let Emacs' default do so.
[05:00:07] <bpalmer> Unicorn_Princess: that said, yes, it is common in many programming modes to treat TAB as "go to the 'correct' column for indentation" rather than "insert new indentation"

[05:00:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Unicorn_Princess: Indeed, because what you dislike isn't specific to electric-indent.

[05:17:45] <bobdobbs> Hi all. A few days ago I was working at setting up my emacs js environment. Just now I opened a scss file. when I save the file, something happens: a minibuffer opens up that appears to be the output of an attempt to compile the scss. I don't remember even trying to set this up at all...

[05:18:57] <bobdobbs> My guess is that the automatic compilation is provided by dap-mode. But if I disable dap-mode in the buffer, the automatic compilation attempt still happens when I save the buffer

[07:04:15] <Unicorn_Princess> it never ends with emacs, does it?
[07:04:18] <bpalmer> Al-Khwarizmi: buffers belong to the emacs process; there is always at least one window in a frame showing a buffer, but all the buffers that aren't shown are still available. 
[07:04:38] <bpalmer> Unicorn_Princess: C-h v evil-shift-width RET and you will see whether it is by default buffer-local.
[07:05:07] <bpalmer> Unicorn_Princess: if so, setq only applies to whatever buffer the evaluation takes place in ; you would want setq-default to change the initial value it has in a new buffer.
[07:05:20] <Al-Khwarizmi> hmm, that is quite weird my tab-line-mode shows the windows open in the current frame plus the buffer from the previous frame that I `make-frame`ed from
[07:05:28] <Al-Khwarizmi> I understand that buffers are global
[07:05:36] <Al-Khwarizmi> but why does tab-line have this behaviour
[07:05:36] *** Joins: monaaraj (~MonAaraj@user/mon-aaraj/x-4416475)
[07:05:41] <bpalmer> I don't know how tab bar works by default, nor do I know persp.
[07:06:07] <Unicorn_Princess> bpalmer, by buffer-local, you mean "automatically becomes buffer local when set"?
[07:06:14] <Unicorn_Princess> (that's what the description says)
[07:06:29] <Unicorn_Princess> (it also gives both global and local values)
[07:07:29] <bpalmer> if you want to write your own function which only shows the windows visible in the current frame, you could do a function that returns (mapcar 'window-buffer (window-list (selected-frame)))

[07:07:41] <bpalmer> Unicorn_Princess: yes, precisely, automatically becomes buffer local when set.
[07:07:56] <bpalmer> Unicorn_Princess: that's what lets you know setq will only affect whatever buffer is active when the code is evaluated.
[07:09:17] *** Joins: mbuf (~Shakthi@122.174.202.253)
[07:09:18] <Unicorn_Princess> ah, so all those text/prog-mode hooks i've been writing with (setq ..) can be replaced by (setq-default ..)! \o/
[07:10:09] <bpalmer> Unicorn_Princess: maybe. On the other hand, modes routinely will set variables like indent-line-function themselves  (because a global default value for indentation doesn't make sense for somebody who's working in M68k assembly and C++ and Prolog)
[07:10:34] <bpalmer> running in a mode hook means that you get to make changes *after* the mode has done most of its work, as a last minute override.
[07:11:13] <bpalmer> (I suspect that eventually you will not want to mess with stuf in prog-mode-hook but you'll instead pick a few programming modes that you *do* want that in)
[07:11:32] <bpalmer> assuming you start using different programming languages and build tools and yaml etc
[07:11:47] <Unicorn_Princess> aye. obviously i don't trust this pile of lisp arcana to believe anything will work without testing it out :)
[07:11:56] <bpalmer> good luck.
[07:11:59] * bpalmer heads out
[07:12:01] <Unicorn_Princess> but in this case, it worked!

[07:25:26] <Unicorn_Princess> wait wait wait. i thought setq was equivalent to setq-local... oh, so in case a variable isn't buffer-local, setq would modify it for all buffers. but setq-local creates a buffer-local copy and modifies that instead, so other buffers are unaffected?

[07:28:41] <jimeh> Yeah, setq-local ensures the new value will only affect the current buffer, even if it is a global variable…

[12:45:13] <aidalgol> empwilli: That's how GPUs operate, right?
[12:45:20] <empwilli> no
[12:45:24] <empwilli> that's SPMD
[12:45:26] <empwilli> :D
[12:45:28] <aidalgol> oh...
[12:45:43] <empwilli> rule of thumb: all these things from Flynn's Taxonomy have 4 letters
[12:45:44] <twb> NUMA is like certain RAM sticks are closer to certain CPUs so they can use those faster
[12:45:52] <kilobug> aidalgol: in short NUMA means that various cores of the CPU have faster/easier accss to some part of the memory
[12:46:03] <empwilli> because interconnects don't scale as well and memory contention makes it even worse
[12:46:14] <twb> also at the higher level, blades and SANs
[12:46:15] <empwilli> typically, however, NUMA is kept cache coherent
[12:46:33] <empwilli> so NUMA = ccNUMA, at least at the moment (and for some systems in the future)
[12:46:34] <twb> same problem at one level up in component scale
[12:46:46] <aidalgol> brb, getting aspirin...
[12:47:20] <kilobug> aidalgol: so the OS should try to schedule the process on the cores that have easy access to their memory (or the other way around, allocate the physical memory that's easy to access for the core it runs on)

[17:03:17] <wasamasa> think about it for a second
[17:03:22] <wasamasa> you're in a search input box
[17:03:37] <wasamasa> you want every letter you type to add one letter to the current search term
[17:03:43] <wasamasa> that pretty much rules out modal editing
[17:04:08] <Unicorn_Princess> it's a buffer like any other. don't see why i wouldn't be able to edit it like any other
[17:04:46] <wasamasa> it would be horrible from a UX perspective to enter insert mode to insert a damn search term, then leave it to paste something else
[17:05:01] <wasamasa> whereas you could just enter it and press a modifier key to paste
[17:05:15] <Unicorn_Princess> one common case is i wanna search for a word i copy (sorry)... i guess it could be worse than C-y...
[17:05:24] <Unicorn_Princess> s/(sorry)/

[20:01:04] <johnjaye> i.e. indent this line to a line a few lines up or something
[20:01:11] <johnjaye> so reparsing the whole file would be bad
[20:01:20] <Common-Lisp> yeah, that's why the heuristic indentation works perfectly fine in 98% of cases 
[20:01:30] <johnjaye> the 98% solution
[20:02:18] <Common-Lisp> getting that 98% to 100% would require a pretty significant performance hit, both in time and resource utilization, so it's definitely not worthwhile as a reasonable default.

[21:51:03] <wgreenhouse> the emacs process can handle input in any encoding emacs supports, unrelated to what the current display/terminal can render with a glyph
[21:51:53] <wgreenhouse> for example the linux console is generally limited to one font able to display 512 glyphs. emacs doesn't know that or care.
[21:52:18] <johnjaye> well i guess i have a bad font then
[21:52:25] <wgreenhouse> what emacs can actually _display_ would be limited by the current terminal, however, of course
[21:52:26] <johnjaye> because it display greek letters earlier but not this character
[21:53:13] <wgreenhouse> johnjaye: I don't know anything about the BSD console. if it has similar limitations to the Linux one, you may have to choose which codepoints/glyphs you need to be able to display

[22:46:40] <kiki_lamb> So, I'm on Mac. When I install the ordinary emacs cask via homebrew, Info includes the Emacs Lisp Reference manual. When I instead install the emacs-plus@28 or emacs-plus@29 formula, Info does not contain the reference manual. How should I go about installing it? I like having it in Info.

[22:47:14] *** Joins: chep (~chep@82-65-36-115.subs.proxad.net)
[22:47:35] <johnjaye> the reference manual is in a folder somewhere but info didn't display it for some reason
[22:47:47] <johnjaye> so you had to open the file directly
[22:48:02] *** Joins: lisp123 (~lisp123@5.30.23.247)
[22:48:29] <kiki_lamb> johnjaye: Hmm. Do you recall how to do that? 
[22:48:46] <kiki_lamb> I'm not sure how to manually open files in Info, I'm used to just browsing it.
[22:49:34] <Catie> It was something about like "updating the dir". I could be remembering a different thing though
[22:49:51] <johnjaye> kiki_lamb: info is a mode so emacs will automatically launch it when you open the file
[22:49:54] <johnjaye> but you have to know where it is
[22:50:12] <johnjaye> tip: do C-x C-f which will automatically prompt  you for a file starting in the current directory
[22:50:43] <kiki_lamb> Let me see if I can locate the file.
[22:50:46] *** Parts: acdw (~case@user/acdw) (See You, Space Cowpokes . . .)
[22:52:36] <johnjaye> so if you info a file and do C-x C-f you will see your current dir. or just do C-h v default-directory

[22:58:35] <JordiGH> So I can just see the text, no tags.
[22:58:41] <JordiGH> Uhm, I guess I could render the damn thing.
[22:58:45] <JordiGH> In eww?
[22:58:54] <Common-Lisp> yeah, rendering in eww is what I would recommend 
[22:58:56] <johnjaye> JordiGH: tfw you ask a self-answering question
[22:59:40] <JordiGH> eww worked, thanks everyone!
[22:59:53] <kiki_lamb> Yeah... I'm used to running the standard version but I decided to try out the plus versions the other day... 29 was having bugs with some of my ELPA/MELPA packages, but 28 seemed solid and had some neat new features. I just want my elisp manual back. >_>
[23:00:05] <johnjaye> i used eww earlier because i wanted to copy unicode from a webpage in terminal
[23:00:50] <johnjaye> kiki_lamb: the terminology is strange, so cask just refers to install scripts where the thing uses native macos widgets?

[23:01:57] <Common-Lisp> I thought cask just meant binary release 
[23:02:00] <Common-Lisp> also aren't casks deprecated
[23:02:28] <kiki_lamb> johnjaye: Yeah, casks are basically just scripts that download and install a pre-compiled binary from somewhere (and most GUI or closed source apps come as casks). Formulas usually build themselves from source, and so are usually for open source apps.
[23:04:14] <johnjaye> ok. i forgot why d12frosted version is better honestly

[23:08:44] <kiki_lamb> The xwidgets one is nice, I've been enjoying being able to stick YouTube and Discord in querter screen windows, so I'd rather not go back to the cask.
