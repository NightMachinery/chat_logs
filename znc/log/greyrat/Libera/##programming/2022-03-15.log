[02:01:18] <Hash> You can't play 7 string songs on a 6. Stop aruging. 
[02:01:20] <ProfSimm> apotheon: what bothers me more is why they don't make keyboard keys to last.
[02:01:29] <ProfSimm> apotheon: or at least wear out evenly.
[02:01:43] <apotheon> ProfSimm: You don't use them evenly.  That's why they don't wear evenly.
[02:01:44] <ProfSimm> apotheon: I understand if it's some cheap garbage but it's a microsoft keyboard, decent one
[02:01:49] <apotheon> err
[02:01:59] <apotheon> Microsoft keyboards are often cheap garbage.

[02:02:32] <Hash> Gamah | there's nothing inherently special about a guitar with more or less than 6 strings   <- with the addition of strings, you get more possible chord voicings and lot more is possible.

[02:03:03] <Gamah> oldlaptop: agree... double shot would be my next step if i ever did get marked ones.
[02:03:04] <oldlaptop> if you manage to wear dye-sub legends down, you're doing something really wrong. (right?)

[02:16:00] <apotheon> You might be able to make more with PL/SQL.
[02:16:03] <sonny> I just got to iterators in rust and they remind me of sequences in fsharp
[02:16:08] <apotheon> . . . and you wouldn't have to use TSQL.
[02:16:14] <pyzozord> ProfSimm yeah some database engineering jobs would work
[02:16:15] <Gamah> yeah but then i'd have to deal with oracle
[02:16:19] <apotheon> true
[02:16:24] <InPhase> Gamah: But yeah, it's always worth branching out in your skill base.  Get some side skill built up, then look for a position where you can leverage your existing strengths for a position which is more split in responsibilities, and build up credentials in the other skills, and keep sliding laterally like that.
[02:16:31] <apotheon> . . . but not whole-table locks every time you do anything!
[02:16:31] <Gamah> which means i could get closer to java.... which.. nope
[02:16:33] <ProfSimm> sonny: sequences in F#, Clojure and so on are iterator indeed
[02:16:47] <nitrix> beaky, This https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_chaining, but I don't know if you've ever dealt with SLD resolution.
[02:16:52] <apotheon> Gamah: I understand your concerns.
[02:16:54] <Gamah> apotheon: sql server has come a long way since 2012, whole table locks are pretty rare now. but page locks are still more common than i'dl ike
[02:16:55] <InPhase> Gamah: I think generally the more areas you have strengths in, the more robust your career is to shifts.  Also you have more options for when you get tired of things.
[02:17:08] <Gamah> InPhase: working on doing that with cpp at the moment
[02:17:08] <sonny> ProfSimm iterator was supposed to care about computation from the start? I doubt it
[02:17:19] <Gamah> i've even managed to write multithreaded code that works!
[02:17:26] <ProfSimm> sonny: hm?
[02:17:28] <apotheon> Gamah: Switch to PostgreSQL.
[02:17:30] <pyzozord> ProfSimm as some specialized form of DevOps or admin. But there aren't meny of those people needed. Maybe one specialized person like that for 500 "normal" devs
[02:17:40] <apotheon> If you can find a job that pays well enough with Postgres. . . .
[02:17:40] <sonny> it's not a typical iterator
[02:17:44] <InPhase> Gamah: A solid choice.  But do you also have Python skill?  That one is easier to split usage with SQL if you need to go that route.
[02:17:47] <Gamah> apotheon: $dayjob is doing that (moving to amazon RDS so i'll get free training and XP

[02:18:13] <Gamah> apotheon: paid under market, not particularly interested in the industry
[02:18:13] <apotheon> You get PL/pgSQL, and not Java!

[02:18:24] <apotheon> hm
[02:18:28] <apotheon> Rust, maybe.
[02:18:30] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: I don't know. Many "normal" devs write apps that save state. And save it to DB
[02:18:33] <sonny> ProfSimm it doesn't compute anything, so you get lazy evaluation
[02:18:41] <Gamah> InPhase: started the cpp project in python, and will use python for parts of it, but for the particular project i needed lots of fast iteration, cpp go brrr
[02:18:47] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: maybe it's less common for client-side apps. Where you "own" the database
[02:18:48] <apotheon> For some reason, beaky didn't agree to make a Rust wizard outta me.
[02:19:03] <ProfSimm> sonny: well that's how all iterators work
[02:19:15] <InPhase> Gamah: Yeah, C++ is the place to go for performance right now.
[02:19:19] <sonny> ah
[02:19:32] <Gamah> InPhase: i'm convinced i have the fastest accurate blackjack simulation code that's out there.
[02:19:38] <pyzozord> ProfSimm yeah but don't need to know how it works for that. Do need to know how to write we apps though, and how to deal with deadlines, managers and colleagues
[02:19:39] <apotheon> Gamah: I dislike Python, too, by the way.
[02:19:40] <Gamah> there's a few that are faster, but proprietary and still have bugs
[02:19:45] <ProfSimm> sonny: of course some implementation may precompute, but in general the interface is designed so you compute "on the go' item by item

[02:21:05] <ProfSimm> sonny: in Java Iterator is just an interface, so it depends who implemented it. Some are lazy some are not. When you iterate a List, well the List usually already exists.
[02:21:09] <sonny> I got it in december, but it's over now
[02:21:20] <ProfSimm> sonny: a more apt example is the iterators that generator functions provide in say JS
[02:21:33] <ProfSimm> sonny: you yield one item and the function stops until the next yield.
[02:21:47] <ProfSimm> sonny: in Java this would be you computing one item in the next() method impl
[02:21:55] <sonny> yeah, that's not what you said though
[02:22:07] <ProfSimm> sonny: you can make for ex. an iterator that returns prime numbers forever. And only compute the next one

[02:35:18] <apotheon> The missus is working at a place where she recently had to start bumping up numeric types to larger types in several databases.
[02:35:30] <pyzozord> I think at least half of that is devs
[02:35:38] <Gamah> but i guess i'm speaking as nearly a decade-hardened DBA...
[02:35:44] <apotheon> Of course, part of the reason for that is the fact that those DBs were running on a DBMS with smaller numeric types than her usual DBMS there.
[02:35:51] <oldlaptop> Gamah: I take that to mean 3k *employees*, not 3k users
[02:35:53] <sonny> isn't >= 1k a big workplace?

[02:37:30] <Gamah> you have millions of users only doing 800tran/sec on db's?

[02:39:25] <nomagno> panik
[02:39:28] <oldlaptop> The data model is almost certainly, properly considered, the core of what you're building, and if you're using SQL databases your SQL can easily be lots of your logic too.

[02:40:40] <ProfSimm> Gamah: only question is where you draw the line
[02:40:52] <apotheon> I think that's Gamah's point:
[02:40:56] <apotheon> Always draw a line.
[02:41:05] <nomagno> I don't really user proprietary software, and realistically a company that has a majoritarily proprietary stack is either having a very uncommon setup, loses them money, or have extremely good deals setup
[02:41:07] <apotheon> Don't try to do both.
[02:41:16] <nomagno> Remove "looses them money"
[02:41:20] <Gamah> sonny: because you really don't want to debug "this button does x when it should do y" only to find out that the top level DB call goes down 4 or 5 other levels of stored procs.... and then just when you think you fixed the DB, you find out that for the specific case that button was clicked that the user experienced... was actually a different top level DB call based on some logic you didn't see the first time in the app

[02:41:59] <oldlaptop> Gamah: I think stored procedures are a bit of a hazard, yes.
[02:42:13] <oldlaptop> To the extent you're embedding "logic", it should probably be mostly in queries.
[02:42:16] <Gamah> nomagno: millions of microsoft and oracle companies would like to say otherwise.
[02:42:35] <KillerWasp> It's what I hear every time they talk about SQL.
[02:42:56] <beaky> nice i like stored procedures they run in the database so are screaming-fast because they are close to the data and also act as an app friendly api
[02:42:57] <Gamah> oldlaptop: i haven't seen many 'big-ish' places that let the app send ad-hoc queries.
[02:43:05] <oldlaptop> Gamah: I would imagine a lot of Oracle customers would kind of like to not be Oracle customers.
[02:43:13] <oldlaptop> Gamah: Substitute "views" for "queries" as appropriate.
[02:43:17] <Gamah> oldlaptop: definitely.
[02:43:23] <apotheon> I loved the story about how FTD switched to PostgreSQL via EnterpriseDB because Oracle couldn't scale to meet FTD's needs on Valentine's Day or Mother's Day or something like that.
[02:43:23] <nomagno> Gamah: Microsoft Windows as a server is definitely an uncommon setup. Oracle... Uh, is anyone even using Solaris?
[02:43:34] <apotheon> I think it was (perhaps appropriately initialized) VD.
[02:43:42] <Gamah> oldlaptop: i guess i meant business logic like deciding what values to update, save, delete, aggregate based on logic exclusively stored in the DB

[03:34:14] <sonny> not sure what you mean?

[04:13:14] <oldlaptop> Historians can pick through all the pieces from a distance, ideally.
[04:13:15] <dTal> you talk like it's easier to find out what's going on right now. It's not, it's harder.
[04:13:32] <oldlaptop> KillerWasp: I figured it was some kind of joke, I merely completely and utterly fail to understand what it's supposed to be about
[04:13:38] <amigojapan> dTal: no. As time goes by it is harder to know what really happened
[04:13:59] <dTal> Depends on the timescale.
[04:14:17] <KillerWasp> oldlaptop: really no matter. If you understand, you can laugh.
[04:14:28] <amigojapan> dTal: evidence becomes unavailable
[04:14:36] <dTal> Evidence becomes available.
[04:15:18] <dTal> For example, we now know that Putin's been planning an actual invasion of Ukraine for at least all of 2022. If you'd asked people in January, few would have believed he'd actually do it.
[04:15:21] <oldlaptop> amigojapan: One example comes to mind: Most air forces through the history of aerial warfare have overestimated the number of enemy aircraft they destroy. Maybe propaganda value and wishful thinking feeds into that, but it's also difficult to make reliable assessments when you're busy trying not to die in an air battle, especially when any wrecked enemy planes will be over enemy territory.
[04:16:04] <dTal> People keep secrets. Those secrets get revealed, in time.
[04:16:17] <amigojapan> dTal: "history"is really just a fictional story loosely based on true events and colored by the biases of the particular country that wrote is
[04:16:20] <oldlaptop> In 1941 in China/Burma, the AVG ("Flying Tigers") thought they destroyed maybe twice the Japanese aircraft they really did. (from memory - the exaggeration factor may be different, but it is substantial)
[04:16:37] <dTal> Either by their actions, which reveal the purpose of the secret, or by accident.
[04:16:40] <oldlaptop> The Japanese army thought it destroyed enough AVG planes to obliterate the AVG several times over.
[04:16:55] <dTal> amigojapan: I realize that's what you're trying to say, and I reject it.
[04:17:24] <oldlaptop> Historians now have access to both sides records of who actually made it home and who didn't, and so we have a much more accurate overall picture of each side's losses.

[04:52:11] <pulse> InPhase, considering how many russian flags are all over that city, and how many people are willing to curse ukraine, i highly doubt it's the russian side
[04:52:15] <pulse> but that's just my observation
[04:52:32] <Gamah> that sounds like passing judgement
[04:52:35] <pulse> the channel i linked has a ton of content. a lot of civilians that hate ukraine from the bottom of their hearts. you can see it easily
[04:52:38] <ProfSimm> pulse: so why don't they move to Russia
[04:52:51] <pulse> Gamah, well, i have to make *some* educated guesses. but i admit they could easily be wrong
[04:53:02] <Gamah> you really don't have to, nobody is making you, i promise
[04:53:04] <pulse> ProfSimm, they are ethnically russian. they speak russian
[04:53:06] <oldlaptop> (BBC's full-text search is not very good)
[04:53:07] <InPhase> pulse: It is made complicated by the fact that Putin has been pretty transparent about attempting to launch some attacks that he would blame on Ukraine.  This was made apparent when he started announcing that Ukraine was about to deploy chemical weapons given to them by the U.S. (which did not happen).
[04:53:14] <ProfSimm> pulse: yes so why they don't move to Russia
[04:53:27] <pulse> ProfSimm, i guess they consider that region russia

[04:53:57] <Gamah> as if to egg them on it feels like
[04:54:07] <InPhase> pulse: So there simply being a bombing of civilians within a Russian controlled area, looking just like the bombings of civilians Russians have been doing, does not really tell me what has happened.  I would need more data.
[04:54:09] <ProfSimm> pulse: we come back to those jokes about 'I declare myself an independent nation'. You can't just do that at awill
[04:54:29] <ProfSimm> pulse: no one is stopping anyone from being anywhere for the most part.
[04:54:36] <pulse> InPhase, well i would suggest watching at least some content from the channel i linked. it gets pretty obvious fast what the popular opinion is

[04:54:42] <InPhase> pulse: That said, I will concur it's horrific.  The whole mess needs to stop.

[05:00:34] <BASHitup> Can someone explain something ... I'm looking at code and I've got: for arg in "$@"
[05:00:50] <oldlaptop> Depends on who it's with, probably.
[05:00:56] <BASHitup> I know how to work with it, but I don't understand how the "@" operates when it's nowhere else in the script. 
[05:00:59] <Gamah> oldlaptop: elaborate?
[05:01:07] <oldlaptop> BASHitup: It's a special parameter in sh.
[05:01:26] <BASHitup> So, the @ is the opposite of the argument which executes $ ... but it's not referenced in the body of the script beyond being defined at the beginning. 
[05:01:32] <oldlaptop> ("parameter" is what POSIX calls what normal people probably universally call 'variables')
[05:01:33] <BASHitup> What does it mean? 
[05:01:47] <oldlaptop> All the script's command-line arguments, basically.
[05:02:12] <oldlaptop> It's also subtly and weirdly different from normal "parameters", in that it's kinda-sorta an array (even though POSIX sh doesn't really have arrays)
[05:02:30] <oldlaptop> in fact (IIRC) it shouldn't be quoted in that context
[05:02:58] <ProfSimm> pulse: the sad thing is there are people who fled from Syria to Donetsk, when Russia was bombing Syria. Then they fled Donetsk, when Ukraine was bombing Donetsk. And now they're fleeing again, because Russia is bombing all major cities in Ukraine.
[05:03:05] <BASHitup> Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one. When the expansion occurs within double quotes, each parameter expands to a separate word.
[05:03:16] <BASHitup> that's it right there ... according to the documentation 
[05:03:19] <ProfSimm> pulse: the only objective conclusion is that growing the conflict doesn't help people's suggesring

[05:06:05] <oldlaptop> I was wondering why you repeated it three times.
[05:06:18] <oldlaptop> That's also a reasonable summary of what it does.
[05:06:23] <BASHitup> Then there's the question of whether or not Korn can replace Bash. I know an engineer who's of the firm opinion that it's not a sufficient substitute

[05:06:43] <oldlaptop> In case it's not clear to you, those are the commandline arguments with which the script was started.
[05:06:57] <BASHitup> I repeated it three times because each entry corresponds to three shells, respectively: sh, bash, kssh ... then csh 
[05:07:12] <BASHitup> In csh, it's blank but you can't see that unless you're looking at the same table. 
[05:07:12] <oldlaptop> I think that's mostly an academic question, in that a script that "needs" ksh or bash features probably should not be a shell script.
[05:07:17] <oldlaptop> (Yes, I see that.)
[05:07:50] <BASHitup> Well, I don't even know what an array is. I mean, I can figure it out in like 15 seconds with Google and I can follow convos if I need to but there are basic things I don't know. Poverty mentalities are useless though.

[05:51:44] <sonny> that's what computers are for I guess
[05:51:49] <oldlaptop> The US, famously, toyed with lasers for shooting down missiles a while back. ("Star wars" and all that.)
[05:52:04] <pulse> i'm like 99% sure the US has blackops space tech by this point
[05:52:06] <oldlaptop> It sure is. Modern missile defense systems are *nuts*.
[05:52:21] <InPhase> pulse: Well it is hard to shoot them down effectively.  I suppose they only partially succeeded.
[05:52:22] <pulse> i don't know what it is though. conspiracy vary in wildness
[05:52:40] <pulse> InPhase, i think even if you hit a cluster bomb, it will still go off into fragments
[05:52:57] <pulse> anyway the whole thing sucks really bad. hope it's resolved asap
[05:52:58] <oldlaptop> They probably won't hit what they were supposed to, though.
[05:53:10] <pulse> i think you shoot down a missile by actually exploding another missile close by
[05:53:14] <InPhase> pulse: I didn't see any evidence that it must have been a cluster bomb rather than a missile that had been shot down.
[05:53:21] <pulse> you don't literally ram into a missile at velocity, i would expect
[05:53:41] <pulse> InPhase, yeah. there were a bunch of fragments visible. idk for sure though
[05:53:42] <oldlaptop> If you're a military commander, I imagine you'll take "the bomblets scatter all over the place, maybe in a populated area oops" over "the bomblets hit my troops"
[05:53:54] <pulse> hmm
[05:54:40] <oldlaptop> I'm no subject-matter expert, but AIUI at least some modern missile-defense systems are basically kinetic-kill things. i.e. it does have to actually *hit* the target.
[05:54:43] <oldlaptop> As I say, they're nuts.
[05:54:54] <pulse> hmm
[05:55:02] <InPhase> pulse: I think that Patrick Lancaster is collecting useful opinions and stories of people in a war torn area, which is a worthwhile endeavor.  But in large part he is simply reporting the speculations of the locals about what is going on.  Many of them in the videos were openly describing things they said they didn't see happen.  Which is fine, as journalism, to gather opinions.  This is worth 
[05:55:05] <pulse> i did see a demonstration of some isreali tank with active defense
[05:55:08] <InPhase> knowing.  But it is a different thing from careful fact checking.
[05:55:18] <pulse> i think it shot another projectile with overwhelming velocity and it exploded at safe distance, or something similar
[05:55:23] <oldlaptop> I can't imagine how much engineering effort goes into something like Iron Dome, for instance. (IIRC the ROK expressed some interest in that for shooting down *artillery shells*, which gives you some idea.)
[05:55:49] <InPhase> pulse: It is a sad set of experiences those people have lived through.  Clearly the most common bond between it all is that most of them seem to just wish the war and fighting would stop.
[05:56:08] <pulse> InPhase, i agree, but the general sentiment is easy to pick up after a few of those videos. people claim they've been terrorized by ukrainians for years in that region
[05:56:16] <pulse> and it's not one person saying it. it's ... entire towns
[05:56:17] <oldlaptop> Warships generally have some kind of machine-gun system for close-in missile defense as well. (I think at that kind of range it's only somewhat better to shoot the missile down than to let it hit.)
[05:57:07] <pulse> iron dome is seriously impressive
[05:57:19] <pulse> wouldn't think it was possible if i didn't see those videos
[05:57:31] <InPhase> pulse: Well there has been a military conflict there for somewhere around 8 years now.
[05:57:47] <oldlaptop> meaning there has been hell there.
[05:57:52] <pulse> i'm pretty sure there's blackops tech that's about 20-30 years ahead at this point. there's simply gotta be
[05:58:39] <InPhase> pulse: It seems to have started right after the Russian invasion of Crimea.

[06:03:50] <InPhase> pulse: It was an interesting alternate perspective in those videos, so thanks for the link.  It didn't appreciably alter my assessment of the general scope of what's going on, but it was good to see how that group of civilians is perceiving the situation.
[06:04:21] <pulse> i've been trying to keep up with both perspectives but find it increasingly hard
[06:04:34] <pulse> have to go out of my way to find any sort of information that is actually against ukraine
[06:04:37] <InPhase> A better understanding between the people will be helpful once all the troops end up going away.
[06:04:48] <pulse> which, to a degree is understandable but you can't possibly understand a conflict if all information you get is from a single side of it
[06:04:59] <pulse> that, and the whole "putin is insane" thing, i really didn't buy that
[06:05:02] <pulse> i still don't
[06:05:18] <oldlaptop> That's another thing for the historians to argue about.
[06:05:27] <pulse> i think he's ruthless, possibly overly adventurous and confident, i think he's probably a psycho, but i don't think he's insane
[06:05:36] <oldlaptop> (Or maybe they won't need to argue much? who knows what happens next.)
[06:05:43] <pulse> i think he has some weird romance with the idea of restoring the soviet union
[06:05:56] <pulse> that, coupled with the fact that he's surrounded by yes-men who give him false information
[06:06:00] <pulse> ... and you get this disaster unfolding

[07:34:12] <audio> they need to be streamed so people can't download
[07:35:02] <oldlaptop> Streaming is not really fundamentally any different from "downloading". If they're "streaming" it, they're downloading it too, by definition.
[07:35:22] <arahael> A lot of people struggle to realise that.
[07:35:37] <arahael> For example, I'm "not allowed to download" movies, but I am allowed to stream them.
[07:35:51] <oldlaptop> Normally, perhaps, they don't choose to keep the data they downloaded after it's played, but it's not fundamentally possible to stop them from doing that.

[07:41:33] <oldlaptop> It's completely bogus from a practical point of view; your "streaming" content *will* get pirated (unless it just gets pirated from somewhere else) and will thereafter be easier to obtain illegally than to stream from your service

[07:58:05] <sonny> InPhase that was in 2015-2017, I read around the web about their service being bad, but those were like early 2010s comments ... I will never trust them again

[08:07:30] <oldlaptop> The goal is compute parallelism, not concurrency (unless it *is* the case that runtime is dominated by I/O? I suppose I assumed it was compute-bound.)
[08:08:27] <oldlaptop> In any case, all you really need is a moderately smarter shell script (i.e. probably not a single find(1) call) that only runs $ncpu copies at a time. :)
[08:09:32] <sonny> `Seq.map task files |> Async.Parallel |> Async.RunSynchronously` ez
[08:09:47] <oldlaptop> A makefile could be promising too, since make already knows how to do concurrent jobs.

[08:11:51] <oldlaptop> If you don't mind starting N processes at once, plus N shells.

[08:12:19] <sonny> I assumed it was a small amount

[08:40:58] <ski> Make is an "idiomatic/applicative" build system. meaning that the output of some intermediate build targets can't end up forming (parts of) the dependency tree that Make is tracking and following. a build system where intermediate results *can* affect the dependency tree (so that the whole dependency tree can't in general be known in full prior to starting building things) is known as "monadic"

[08:43:48] <ski> it's trading more expressive power ("cavalier power") for less reasoning power ("predictive power") (which implies less ability to statically analyze the dependencies prior to build-time, which potentially could lead to more efficient execution)

[09:31:13] <euouae> KillerWasp you modified libpng by removing the setjmp() line? Is that right?

[09:32:51] <ishan> Hi! What is the "average" text compression ratio with gzip, flate or zlib? I have some records that are upto 400KB in size. I want to send them somewhere but I can only do that in 256KB chunks. I don't have the real data yet so I am testing this by generating random strings and compressing them(with `BestCompression`) and so far, All 3 of them have only been able to compress it to 300KB 
[09:33:14] <euouae> ishan split the records before compression
[09:33:34] <ishan> Another approach that will work for me is to upload the records on S3 and then send a link to it to the other side but I am trying to make this work by just compressing it  :( 
[09:33:43] <euouae> use split(1) on linux
[09:33:45] <Decker> ishan repetition is better for gzip... generating randomness is harder to compress

[10:04:39] <EdFletcher> if it's an opaque pointer (from the api consumers perspective) then it may indeed change underneath you, but you're not supposed to worry about that -- if it does, it's because the api wanted it to (likely swapping in-memory representations) 
[10:04:51] <EdFletcher> and if they _are_ doing that, storing the _old_ pointer is going to lead to a world of hurt

[14:22:57] <Gamah> generally if you're serving audio you prefer the client to have a cache of the stuff locally
[14:22:58] <Masklin__Gurder> Hello. I realised I've never fully understood what an "object" is in programming. Could someone help me see the light?
[14:23:13] <Gamah> that way they don't keep downloading the latest miley cyrus song 400 times a dsy

[14:23:41] <Masklin__Gurder> GeDaMo: Associated code?
[14:23:58] <GeDaMo> Usually, the data is encapsulated, it can only be access by the attached code, not by outside code
[14:24:05] <audio> amigojapan, i'm confused

[15:06:26] <audio> i just finished building my first neural network about a week ago. It's called The Axis. It allows people to see how similar their song is to Jimi Hendrix' songs
[15:06:53] <audio> People like it but it didn't go viral or anything
[15:06:59] <Gamah> how do you even begin to quantify that score lol
[15:07:15] <audio> Gamah, exactly lol. i was stuck on that question for months
[15:07:28] <Gamah> i'm listening?
[15:07:33] <audio> Gamah, but it came down to feeding a concurrent neural network "hendrix" and "not hendrix" data
[15:07:59] <Gamah> i feel like there isn't a statistically significant set of hendrix data
[15:08:06] <audio> training the model on said data, and then the "prediction" that the neural net had for new data became the "index"
[15:08:41] <audio> like, if the neural net predicted that "Song X" had a 33% chance of being by Jimi Hendrix, then it had a Hendrixian Index of 33% lol

[15:09:41] <Gamah> emperical is a strong word.... just like novel was... and can't.
[15:09:52] <audio> Gamah, well, the model had 85% accuracy on the test set, so take with that what you will
[15:10:15] <Gamah> it didnt't even ace it's test data? lol
[15:10:44] <audio> Gamah, most projects which do classification on song data split the clips into 3 secs

[15:11:09] <audio> Gamah, 85% is really good for this
[15:11:25] <audio> many deep learning projects are lucky to get 70% accuracy
[15:11:25] <Gamah> i feel like shazam wouldn't be a hit if it was only 85% accurate.
[15:11:37] <audio> Gamah, well shazam using fingerprinting, not a neural network
[15:11:53] <Gamah> i suppose.
[15:11:55] <audio> and The Axis was more of a fun project, i'm not trying to make moeny from it

[15:12:11] <audio> it's super slow anyway

[17:31:26] <programmar> yea but says that it does, so do i need to manually expire the session on the server side too ?
[17:31:34] <programmar> i mean what is the common practice that people usually implement
[17:31:57] <programmar> the cookie expired and it's all done, no need to clean out some expired sessions on the server or we clean  them 
[17:32:19] *** Quits: gerwand (~gerwand@89-79-181-52.dynamic.chello.pl) (Quit: gerwand)
[17:32:30] <wedr> My personal best practices: We keep the user's session active and non-expiring until the user logs out, or the user session expires in 30 to 45 minutes.
[17:32:54] <wedr> non-expiring = sometimes, we update the user session's token keys
[17:33:11] <Gamah> we do 10 minute sessions
[17:34:14] <wedr> if you use a web framework package (like Spring Boot + Spring Security for Java), the default settings is enough to automate the user session management for you.
[17:34:29] <programmar> hm i never used Java, i am more like into flask of python
[17:34:34] <Gamah> programmar: it's important to understand the server and client are both stateless... neither one should ever make assumptions about the other, or perhaps even assume the other may try to be malicious

[17:35:26] <wedr> programmar, I'm unfamiliar with Flask of Python, so I can't help you there.
[17:35:36] <programmar> and just pop the sessionid out of my list on the serverside when the user logs out 
[17:36:53] <programmar> wedr: also when u said that sometimes u update the user session's token keys, does that mean you have to someone send a new request back to the user to ask them to update the cookie again ?

[17:38:20] <wedr> programmar, no, we just check to see if the user's token is about to expire in 1 minute, and make sure to swap out the token to a new token before the previous token actually expires
[17:38:42] <programmar> so you swap on the server side only ? 
[17:39:08] <wedr> swap on the server, send back the updated token to the client, so the client continues to use their user sessions with the new tokens.

[17:39:28] <programmar> hm yea i guess that's ok
[17:39:40] <programmar> but how do u send back the updated token ? ajax ?
[17:40:19] <wedr> On Angular, we don't use ajax calls.
[17:40:38] <wedr> ajax is for jQuery, which, really, can be deprecated.

[17:40:55] <wedr> use the Web API standards, which surpasses jQuery in various ways
[17:41:42] <wedr> anyway, tangent aside, we just attach the new tokens to the response. The client checks to see if the response data contains extra data first, before continue to do its normal routines.

[17:42:18] <programmar> yea i will try angular later, heard it's TypeScript tho and i only know javascript :P
[17:43:16] <wedr> Anyway, use the standard Browser Web APIs rather than using jQuery + ajax.
[17:43:35] <programmar> sure i kinda do that
[17:43:48] <programmar> but JQuery sure shortens up some syntax, that's the only reason why i use it :P

It's harder to see; but each edge is 1 from the origin (spheres), then on the bottom x/y goes out to 2, and the far corner is 3, (x+y+z)   so it's 3 instead of sqrt(3) distance from the origin

[19:56:35] <davros_> i have two keyboards plugged in, but only one in my vicinity, no animals

[19:57:25] <davros_> now i have a possible explanation
[19:57:53] <davros_> i sometimes fall asleep on my keyboard and spam a load of spaces into an open source file, then I cut that

[23:50:49] <piou> I like the way D does templates. The entire compiler is available at compile time, so you can call any library function, even user defined ones, can even read files (with limitations, the file must be listed as compiler argument), and the syntax reflects that simplicity: myTemplateFunction!(compiletimeargs) instead of myNormalFunction(args). This allows having both compile time and runtime
[23:50:55] <piou> arguments: myFunc!(ctArgs)(rtArgs).
[23:52:48] <piou> No memory issues too as the GC is available at compile time if the user wants to use it, which will get some frowns but on the other hand you don't need 5 years to concat strings like in C++ (https://www.youtube.com/embed/ABg4_EV5L3w), it's just a normal string concatenation with ~
