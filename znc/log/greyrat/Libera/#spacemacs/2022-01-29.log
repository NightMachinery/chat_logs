[01:11:25] <MiPMrnP> Somehow my configuration is fucked and I wonder how I can possibly debug it. Everything works fine except that the display variable within emacs is :1 even when starting with display :0. If I start with -q it is fine and display variable is :0.

[06:53:21] <FromGitter> <gmalecha> i just updated my spacemacs and my git layer seems to have changed a lot, especially around interactive rebasing. In particular, before the update, I would press `f` on a line and it would change to FIXUP or if i pressed `ENTER` it would show the diff. Now, i need to go into edit mode in order to apply these changes and I can't really figure out how to do what I used to do. Is this is magit change (and is it 
[06:53:21] <FromGitter> ... documented somewhere)? or is this a bug in my installation?
[06:55:00] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> probably our bug
[06:55:19] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> not sure yet. but I do see similar issues.
[06:55:49] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> This particular one probably had been mentioned before.
[06:58:11] <FromGitter> <gmalecha> searching around, all i could find was: https://www.reddit.com/r/spacemacs/comments/q0eqcd/how_to_get_my_magit_keybindings_back_mode/
[06:58:32] <FromGitter> <gmalecha> but that seems quite old and i didn't quite understand what to do with it
[07:00:51] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> @gmalecha I mean it  possibly had been reported in this channel.
[07:04:01] <FromGitter> <gmalecha> thanks
[07:09:22] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> there is no fix yet.
[07:09:37] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> I haven't got time to check that
[07:11:40] <FromGitter> <gmalecha> appreciate it. I found something about fixing the keybindings in the history
[07:12:24] <FromGitter> <gmalecha> it's a great project, i just wish i understood it better.
