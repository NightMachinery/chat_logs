[01:31:00] <ridcully_> i had the impression that their vscode clone does not provide the code insights via lsp - but i have not yet investigated more
[01:32:20] <ridcully_> i had the hope that the vs-code clone would enable to me to use nvim for the languages, that are unuseable without ide support (e.g. java)

[01:39:34] <technomancy> LSP's refusal to touch anything that isn't statically analyzable is a real headache
[01:39:46] <technomancy> like why bother building all that infra if you can't even use it for a repl or tests or tracing
[01:40:02] <Para> JetBrains' equivalent is AST based :)
[01:40:18] <Para> And most refactorings are basically AST transformation/rewriting transformations.
[01:40:47] <Para> And a billion caches, of course, gotta beat that hard drive to submission.
[01:41:13] <technomancy> I have co-workers add unnecessary (declare foo) stuff to files to spoon feed jetbrains; it drives me nuts
[01:42:09] <Para> clj-kondo needs that at times as well, though
[01:42:43] <Para> That said, I've never had the need to do that extra declaration stuff.
[01:43:06] <technomancy> yeah this was a while ago; it's possible they fixed it
[01:43:42] <technomancy> but LSP has a similar vibe
[01:49:14] <Para> sure
[01:49:29] <Para> Maybe it's just regexes. But the regexes are really just a weird internal scripting language for string operations.
[01:49:44] <ridcully_> changing your code to make the ide shut up... i love it!  trust your ide more than your compiler...

[03:00:26] <ridcully_> it allows for those olden day functions with kw-pairs to now finally also work by passing maps

[03:01:59] <technomancy> how is that a wart?

[03:03:22] <ridcully_> you save massive amounts if life time to write { and }

[17:31:11] <aphyr> Or roll your own parser if you like, sure!

[17:32:04] <aphyr> also basically all the fields in the spec are optional
[17:32:06] <seebs> hmm. i vaguely recall seeing something warning me that output isn't automatically flushed even by newlines, only by println or explicit flush.
[17:32:19] <seebs> yeah, i was noticing that. that seems like a nicely implemented flag thing.
[17:32:21] <aphyr> but like, if you want docstrings, validation, defaults, etc, those are all there

[17:35:00] <Para> I use it, even though my use is _very_ limited :) I think I've pasted my args+config handling before, hmm...
[17:37:47] <seebs> and it's "lein run -- [command line flags]" to avoid confusing lein.
[17:38:12] <aphyr> Yup, or java -jar <foo.jar> [cli flags]
[17:38:43] <seebs> so. *thinking* i sort of want to have an interactive mode, which i guess is a loop of some kind involving read-line.
[17:39:58] <ridcully_> you could start a clojure repl
[17:40:41] <ridcully_> it's quite easy to pimp it up.  e.g. add rebel-readline or start portal from the start etc

[17:54:02] <seebs> what's "defn-"
[17:54:10] <Para> private scoped defn
[17:54:26] <Para> effectively same as `(defn ^:private bleh...)`
[17:54:36] <Para> Not quite sure why only defn- exists but not def- :)
[17:56:18] <seebs> what does "private scoped" imply? i haven't seen this used yet, so i'm not sure when a function being not-private would affect it.
[17:56:33] <seebs> ahh, "not visible outside namespace"
[17:56:57] <seebs> i think at this point if it were up to me i'd have made that the default and made exporting explicit. :P
[17:59:41] <seebs> okay, now i have a thing which prints "interactive shell goes here" if invoked with -i, and operates on a named file.
[17:59:57] <seebs> that seems like i can mark the work done and just file a ticket for "the interactive shell isn't either"
[18:02:28] <Para> Can't call it directly from another namespace.

[18:09:00] <opqdonut> Para: defn- exists because nothing can be removed, the right way is to use ^:private
[18:09:42] <opqdonut> the rationale is something like this: with ^:private you don't need to implement two versions of every deflike macro, and also encourages more purposeful custom metadata
[18:10:13] <opqdonut> I don't really care either way, but FYI those are the "official" reasons as far as I know

[20:27:00] <rovanion> Because I want the key to be present in the map passed around in my program, but have the value false.

[20:33:10] <seebs> it really is an absolutely amazing question, and so far as I can tell the person asking was serious
[20:33:26] <seebs> I sort of wonder if they just didn't actually read the name and just copied and pasted it as "SECRET_INTERNALS_blah_blah_blah"
[20:35:18] <rovanion> ToxicFrog: Malli gets to examine the data before I am allowed to muck around with it. Unless I add another middleware that sits ontop, but that feels like a dirty non-obvious hack.
[20:36:19] <opqdonut> there's a malli default-value transformer isn't there?
[20:36:39] <opqdonut> or at least that's an example in the README
[20:37:02] <opqdonut> https://github.com/metosin/malli#default-values
[20:37:23] <opqdonut> might be that it's hard to hook up the transformer to your middleware stack of course
[20:37:54] <rovanion> Yes that looks like a thread to follow up on, thank you!
[20:39:35] <opqdonut> I'd also consider making the key optional in the HTTP malli schema
[20:39:43] <opqdonut> and having it be mandatory in your internal schema
[20:39:51] <opqdonut> and having an explicit add-the-defaults step
[20:40:15] <opqdonut> you can easily use something like malli.util/update-properties to make a version of the schema that has an optional key
