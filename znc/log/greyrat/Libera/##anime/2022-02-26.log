[00:01:32] <MootPoot> I still don't really get your deal with small phones 
[00:01:54] <Bco1981> i have small hands
[00:02:02] <MootPoot> Like, 5" sure. But modern phones cram 6" with no bezel or buttons in the same space 
[00:02:22] <MootPoot> And make the phone taller instead of wider
[00:02:32] <Bco1981> and i like to be able to bend while still having my phone in my pocket not trying to dig into my hip.
[00:02:47] <MootPoot> There are some Chinese phones which could work
[00:02:57] <MootPoot> Not sure if you care for xiaomi 
[00:03:20] <Bco1981> i have looked at them, but not sure if i could get it.
[00:03:25] <MootPoot> Aliexpress 
[00:03:38] <MootPoot> I've ordered expensive stuff on there
[00:03:50] <MootPoot> You might need to pay a small import tax 
[00:03:56] <Bco1981> oh, they are on aliexpress?
[00:04:23] <MootPoot> You can get them from aliexpress or local resellers but I usually just get them from ali
[00:06:01] <MootPoot> Those ultra cheap phones are still shit, I'd stay away 
[00:06:11] <MootPoot> At least like 500 bucks 
[00:06:12] <MootPoot> Imo
[00:06:36] <MootPoot> I've tried the 200 ones... They work, that's about all I can wag 
[00:06:38] <MootPoot> Say 
[00:08:34] <Bco1981> found a local xiaomi reseller... but the smallest is 6.5
[00:10:14] <MootPoot> Bco1981: comparing dimensions, this phone is new and also within a few mm of the size of a s7

[00:42:14] <teus> maybe thats why the anime was oddly familiar

[00:42:45] <Bco1981> why... does a phone have... Dolby Atmos

[05:39:16] <emmeka> ButterNoodle Canadian public healthcare covers precisely 1 thing. Services provided by an M.D.
[05:39:30] <ButterNoodle> so not diagnostics
[05:39:36] <ButterNoodle> or medicine
[05:39:36] <Fenderbassist> are there online webcomics in Japanese that might pique her interest?
[05:39:50] <ButterNoodle> ur hospital stays
[05:39:55] <ButterNoodle> *or hospital stays
[05:40:05] <emmeka> ButterNoodle or hospital bed fees. or pharmaceuticals. or any specialist who isn't an M.D. (noteably, dentists... psychologists, therapists... optometrists... so on)
[05:40:15] <ButterNoodle> oh fuck
[05:40:20] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist:webcomics, in japanes, let me google that
[05:40:38] <ButterNoodle> mfw ur cuntry is almost as bad as mine on healthcare...
[05:40:49] <emmeka> ButterNoodle so generally you still need health insurance in Canada. Otoh, if you *don't* have it, and you get hospitalized, you're generally not bankrupted so that's cool
[05:41:01] <ButterNoodle> literally GPs can turnstile patients to specialists and diagnostics to make a mint
[05:41:24] <emmeka> specialists are covered so long as they're doctors, which is usually the case.
[05:41:30] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist:seems korean manwha may be available in japanese
[05:41:34] <ButterNoodle> ok thats not... terrible
[05:41:51] <emmeka> but there's some weird things like a psychiatrist is covered, a psychologist is not.
[05:41:51] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist:for free
[05:41:53] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: might give her something to focus on for a while until you think of the next thing
[05:42:11] <amigojapan> alright Fenderbassist, let me look one up
[05:42:59] <emmeka> ButterNoodle but thankfully I'm counting down the days... March 6... my benefits at the new job come into effect and I have proper health insurance.

[10:35:18] <amigojapan> basuotoko:someone told me that 1 out of 50 peopple have it
[10:37:21] <amigojapan> tomako's uncle had it lately
[10:37:36] <basuotoko> yeah sort of, now Hongkong is fighting for it. luckily in mainland of China the numbers are luckily under control.
[10:38:20] <basuotoko> well, it is aslo been said that omicron causes much less serious outcomes compare to the earlier version.

[10:40:29] <basuotoko> I see, it is not a good news.
[10:40:35] <amigojapan> yup
[10:41:04] <amigojapan> basuotoko:she is calling now to see how he is doing
[10:41:51] <basuotoko> One of the reasons that may explains that why in china the cases are staying low. The strict policies.
[10:42:16] <basuotoko> since the very beginning, those policies have been applied.
[10:42:22] <amigojapan> basuotoko:or the goverment is lying :/
[10:42:32] <basuotoko> I would not think it is a lie.
[10:43:02] <basuotoko> You can not always hide everything, you live in a place, you feel them.
[10:43:07] <jessedesu2> Whoa amigo
[10:43:18] <jessedesu2> You're gonna like airsoft
[10:44:03] <basuotoko> amigojapan, basically, the locking down policy. which is very soft in Japan and in Hongkong.
[10:44:12] <basuotoko> in china it is very strict.
[10:44:49] <basuotoko> And by the way, you can not do locking down right now in the US. for example.
[10:45:02] <amigojapan> jessedesu2:I am thinking of this gun, it seems to be 30% off, and ButterNoodle said it is a good brand Tokyo Marui No. 24 M92F Military Model Stainless Steel HG Air HOP Handgun https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B00Z59EZRK/

[10:45:10] <basuotoko> looking at those numbers in every single day there, can you lock down an area? I would not think so. it is too late.
[10:45:23] <amigojapan> basuotoko:you cant do lockdown in Japan either
[10:45:40] <basuotoko> yeah that is what i am talking about. unless you do it much earlier.
[10:45:48] <jessedesu2> Amigo I want that airsoft gun too
[10:45:49] <basuotoko> before the cases went to crazy.
[10:45:51] <amigojapan> basuotoko:but some countries in europe did lockdown and it did not work well
[10:46:05] <jessedesu2> It's the PMMM akemi homura pistol
[10:46:25] <basuotoko> amigojapan, They did, as you mention in the EU areas, however....
[10:46:27] <jessedesu2> Let's buy it together
[10:46:37] <basuotoko> They did not last that long, i have read those news.
[10:47:05] <basuotoko> They locked down the places in their standard, then unlocked them quickly as well....according to their standard.
[10:47:31] <amigojapan> jessedesu2:its pretty ccheap if I buy it today
[10:47:51] <basuotoko> Thus the virus had not been got away completely, or in a safety scale scientificly.
[10:48:00] <jessedesu2> I dunno if I can get it shipped to me in california
[10:48:10] <basuotoko> They did all of those based on their morals understandings. IMO.
[10:48:38] <basuotoko> plus their moral understands, most of them are based on "freedom" and 'humen rights".

[11:32:23] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: well, it would be a great gift as well, can't go wrong with nerf guns, fun for all ages, but obviously you and tomako should treat yourself to some entertainment.

[11:46:24] <MootPoot> nerf guns and airsoft have about the same power

[11:51:41] <DunceCotus> KatrinValerie: is that really necessary
[11:51:47] <KatrinValerie> And I want to change my name back to KaffeeKatrin, so it's basically my core character trait to be coffee addicted
[11:51:53] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: try not to drink past dark
[11:52:12] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: I don't usually do that anyways, the exceptions is parties.
[11:53:01] <amigojapan> I see KatrinValerie, last all night party I went to was when I was 40yo, and I ended up sleepying 3 days in a row after that
[11:53:01] <KatrinValerie> Oh, my girlfriend and I just finished up the car, we'll have the security inspection on monday, I am really excited
[11:53:12] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: I am too old for that
[11:54:01] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: my girlfriend and I celebrated the achievement yesterday and I went to bed before midnight despite the coffee xD
[11:54:14] <KatrinValerie> I never really did all night parties
[11:54:31] <KatrinValerie> outside of lan parties, but that was more due to my inability to sleep next to a running computer
[11:54:40] <MootPoot> me and my girlfriends were gaming all night then they gave me a handjob then I fell sleep
[11:54:45] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: omg you old man

[11:54:59] <MootPoot> :3
[11:55:03] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: at 40, some girls invited me to a shisha smoking partie, and such parties last all night cause the trains shut down in tokyo
[11:55:17] <amigojapan> DunceCotus:yup, I am 44 now
[11:55:22] <KatrinValerie> MootPoot: are you implying your hands are your girlfriends?
[11:55:44] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: to be fair I'd probably have trouble with an all-night party these days

[11:55:55] <DunceCotus> even back around high school age it was rough going
[11:56:05] <DunceCotus> I never liked sleeping in such party settings so I'd just stay up
[11:56:15] <DunceCotus> and usually there were 1 or 2 of us who would also stay up

[11:56:50] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: the first semester party of the math student association was like that, I stayed till the end and missed the last train home XD.
[11:57:02] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: it seems 40 was the cut off age for me, before that I was fine
[11:57:03] <DunceCotus> you get that "awake for too long" roughness
[11:57:13] <KatrinValerie> I had to wait till early morning when the trains and busses ran again.
[11:57:14] <DunceCotus> borderline hallucinatory state
[11:57:26] <KatrinValerie> DunceCotus: I only get that after like three days
[11:57:45] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: the last train is about 12 midnight, that is whne the party just started
[11:58:01] <DunceCotus> KatrinValerie: my body just forces me to micro-sleep
[11:58:05] <DunceCotus> nodding
[11:58:05] <KatrinValerie> I had horrible insomnia on some medication, I think it was pregabalin or something.
[11:58:21] <DunceCotus> KatrinValerie: oh jeez
[11:58:29] <KatrinValerie> Nervepain is the worst, I hope I never ever again get a trigeminal neuralgia
[11:58:39] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I thought trains in Tokyo never stop :/
[11:58:55] <DunceCotus> this idea of downtime on the tokyo subway.. just what
[11:58:59] <KatrinValerie> I am lucky I got away with just medication, it often requires surgery to really stop
[12:00:41] <KatrinValerie> but the nerve damage it caused is irreversable and the area around my left cheek feels weird and sometimes gives me an electric tingle if you know what I mean.
[12:00:49] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: everyone seems to hitnk that, but tokyo is not really an all night town
[12:01:02] <KatrinValerie> When you can feel electric current but it's too little to really shock?
[12:01:07] <amigojapan> DunceCotus:only cetrain towns like shibuya or roppongi are open at night
[12:01:09] <KatrinValerie> That is how it sometimes feels now.
[12:01:12] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: WTF
[12:01:26] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: people just go home and sleep
[12:01:28] <DunceCotus> KatrinValerie: what caused the nerve damage?
[12:01:40] <KatrinValerie> DunceCotus: chronic inflamation nearby
[12:01:52] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I know it sounds boring, but it is true
[12:01:56] <DunceCotus> KatrinValerie: do you also have skin issues in that area?
[12:01:58] <KatrinValerie> the nerve was constantly firing and eventually wore down 
[12:02:15] <KatrinValerie> DunceCotus: yes I do
[12:02:19] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: even here we have all-night trains on weekends
[12:02:31] <DunceCotus> well they stop around 4am and start again at like 6
[12:02:49] <KatrinValerie> but my whole facial skin is bad, even though it got a lot better since I am on hormone replacement therapy.
[12:03:00] <DunceCotus> KatrinValerie: scleroderma?
[12:03:17] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: here they stop form 12 midnight and start again at 6AM
[12:03:45] <DunceCotus> KatrinValerie: did you get itchiness?
[12:03:49] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: buses shut down even before that, like 9PM
[12:03:56] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: wot
[12:03:58] <KatrinValerie> DunceCotus: I had two testosterone producing benign tumors, it took a while to get insurance to cover their removal.
[12:04:02] <amigojapan> yep DunceCotus
[12:04:20] <DunceCotus> KatrinValerie: are you boy?
[12:04:24] <KatrinValerie> They were like, it won't kill you, so we do not have to treat you!
[12:04:39] <KatrinValerie> DunceCotus: I am a woman.

[12:05:10] <DunceCotus> KatrinValerie: see I think I have the opposite problem
[12:05:15] <KatrinValerie> So I had to get a therapists letter and verified therapeutic sessions
[12:05:19] <DunceCotus> not enough tumours producing testosterone
[12:05:59] <KatrinValerie> DunceCotus: what makes you assume so? I do possess quite some knowledge in endocrinology and can at least tell you if you should visit a doctor.
[12:06:23] <KatrinValerie> The answer is pretty much always visit a doctor
[12:06:41] <KatrinValerie> DunceCotus: if you believe your testosterone to be low, you go to a doctor and tell them your symptoms.
[12:06:43] <DunceCotus> KatrinValerie: I feel like I have some issue of some sort.. I have scleroderma on my cheeks and forehead, itchiness, sunken eyes etc
[12:07:00] <DunceCotus> I don't know if its testosterone related, or thyroid or what
[12:07:06] <KatrinValerie> If you feel brave you can bring up that you suspect it might be a testosterone deficency
[12:07:07] <DunceCotus> its like allergies but I have no allergies :/
[12:07:44] <DunceCotus> I also get slight pain, but it feels deep
[12:08:09] <KatrinValerie> To my knowledge that skin condition does not have anything to do with endocrinology

[12:08:50] <KatrinValerie> Besides being an autoimmune disease, but an immunologist would be more appropriate if the common treatment routines that a GP will prescribe don't work.
[12:09:07] <KatrinValerie> DunceCotus: the answer is see a GP about your rashes
[12:09:35] <DunceCotus> KatrinValerie: I have done
[12:09:41] <KatrinValerie> And if what they prescribe does not work, you can ask for a referal to a specialist, or make an appointment with a specialist yourself if the medical system allows for it
[12:09:49] <DunceCotus> KatrinValerie: they literally had nothing to say, just take antihistamines etc.
[12:10:27] <KatrinValerie> DunceCotus: get a second opinion or see a dermatologist, a dermatologist can rule out allergies
[12:10:34] <DunceCotus> I think it might be myositis
[12:11:04] <DunceCotus> I saw a dermatologist and they said just use moisturiser.. but the moisturiser does nothing :/
[12:11:08] <KatrinValerie> If you think it's not allergies, see a dermatologist and have it confirmed, you need a diagnosis to figure out the right treatment.
[12:11:36] <KatrinValerie> DunceCotus: well, you should see them again in that case.
[12:11:52] <KatrinValerie> Or maybe your skin irritation is so minor that they do not see why you would be worried about it?
[12:11:58] <KatrinValerie> Or bothered?
[12:11:58] <DunceCotus> I've seen a bunch of specialists
[12:12:02] <DunceCotus> they seem to be pretty clueless
[12:12:24] <KatrinValerie> What specialists did you see already?
[12:12:26] <DunceCotus> I see a lot of incompetence in medicine
[12:12:47] <DunceCotus> KatrinValerie: dermatologist, ENT, allergist, eye specialist
[12:12:56] <KatrinValerie> To an extent, that is true, but the more doctors you see, the less likely it is that you do not come across one that will actually look into things.
[12:13:10] <DunceCotus> I think it may relate to a sinus blockage but the ENT said that shouldn't cause skin issues/itchiness
[12:13:48] <KatrinValerie> Yes, you are connecting symptoms with things that cannot cause them.
[12:13:51] <DunceCotus> KatrinValerie: yeah maybe I need to see immunologist
[12:14:02] <KatrinValerie> Have you considered that it could be stress related?
[12:14:10] <DunceCotus> KatrinValerie: oh definitely
[12:14:22] <KatrinValerie> Are you restricting itching it?
[12:14:33] <KatrinValerie> You need to keep your hands off of irritated skin areas

[12:14:59] <KatrinValerie> I know it can be hard, but whatever it is, itching and peeling of skin will worsen it.
[12:15:37] <KatrinValerie> DunceCotus: considering how many doctors you saw, it is unlikely that there is a physical cause
[12:15:57] <KatrinValerie> but if you feel that all your doctors were incompetent you should still seek out a second opinion
[12:16:05] <KatrinValerie> I notice the lack of a GP in that list btw
[12:16:15] <amigojapan> man, Ihave been holding out from peeing, I am very tired form what we did 2 days ago
[12:16:21] <KatrinValerie> DunceCotus: You need a GP, they are supposed to act as a guide to the medical system.
[12:16:38] <KatrinValerie> A good GP is vital to receive decent healthcare
[12:16:43] <DunceCotus> KatrinValerie: I've seen many GPs
[12:16:54] <DunceCotus> who referred me elsewhere
[12:17:05] <DunceCotus> they can only really recommend antihistamines etc.
[12:17:18] <KatrinValerie> Do antihistamines do anything?
[12:17:23] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: peeing?
[12:17:33] <amigojapan> DunceCotus:urinating
[12:17:39] <DunceCotus> KatrinValerie: they stop the itching a bit, but nothing curative
[12:17:53] <KatrinValerie> that still hints at allergic reactions
[12:17:59] <DunceCotus> its like I have some kind of infection

[12:18:06] <KatrinValerie> maybe below the threshold for being detected by a test
[12:18:06] <DunceCotus> KatrinValerie: I've had testing for allergies.. nothing
[12:18:29] <KatrinValerie> DunceCotus: if your skin reactions are really mild, then it is possible for the tests to detect nothing.
[12:18:48] <DunceCotus> KatrinValerie: I get rashes elsewhere on my body
[12:19:02] <KatrinValerie> Are they bad, or just slightly itchy and reddish?
[12:19:04] <DunceCotus> KatrinValerie: I thought it relates to a food sensitivity but I also get it in other situations
[12:19:13] <DunceCotus> could be cholinergic urticaria
[12:19:25] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I get rashes when I take antibiotics, and the itch
[12:19:44] <DunceCotus> KatrinValerie: they were really bad a few years ago, nowadays they're relatively innocuous
[12:19:50] <DunceCotus> but can still get annoying from time to time
[12:20:08] <KatrinValerie> That sounds very much like an allergy, or now rather a subthreshold allergy
[12:20:13] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: yeah this started after antibiotics iirc
[12:20:21] <KatrinValerie> You do react to something, but not quite enough for medicine to call it allergy
[12:20:37] <KatrinValerie> Or it could be classical neurodermitis
[12:21:09] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I am allergic to pennicillin
[12:21:13] <KatrinValerie> DunceCotus: there are some ointments you can use to ease the itching regardless of the cause
[12:21:24] <KatrinValerie> And your doctors would have already spotted an infection by now

[12:23:05] <DunceCotus> nothing makes sense about this
[12:23:17] <DunceCotus> KatrinValerie: the rashes seemingly popped up overnight
[12:23:33] <DunceCotus> since then I'm consistently getting them albeit at random times
[12:23:44] <DunceCotus> sometimes its from certain foods, sometimes its from heat
[12:23:46] <DunceCotus> just rando
[12:23:58] <KatrinValerie> Foods can have penicillin in it
[12:24:10] <KatrinValerie> Because of mold contamination
[12:24:29] <KatrinValerie> I don't know if they still use it in agriculture, but that could also be a possible source
[12:24:57] <KatrinValerie> DunceCotus: keep a food diary and see if you can link the outbreaks to any specific foods, is my best bet.
[12:25:03] <DunceCotus> yeah I mean it could be mold related
[12:25:09] <KatrinValerie> And avoid exposing your self to moldy soil
[12:25:12] <DunceCotus> but I've had mold testing and no reactions :/
[12:25:34] <DunceCotus> KatrinValerie: I have determined it seems to get worse with cow's milk and wheat
[12:25:40] <DunceCotus> so I avoid them now as much as I can

[12:30:20] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: oh great
[12:33:57] <DunceCotus> KatrinValerie: the issue is I can only really afford to rent, and most rental places around here are old and potentially moldy
[12:34:14] <DunceCotus> they are required to treat the mold but landlords get lazy with it 
[12:36:15] <KatrinValerie> If there is an issue with water, you cannot get rid of the mold anyways
[12:36:49] <KatrinValerie> Only if you cut off the water you'll get rid of the mold permanently

[12:44:19] <DunceCotus> I don't know if there's still mold, they said they treated it
[12:44:24] <KatrinValerie> It's a ploy to put the blame on the tenant
[12:44:38] <DunceCotus> but yeah if they provide the dehumidifier likely there's still an issue
[12:44:40] <KatrinValerie> DunceCotus: if it is humid, there will be molds regardless
[12:44:54] <KatrinValerie> Like too humid
[12:45:16] <KatrinValerie> Also, you are probably also paying the power it uses, aren't you?
[12:45:24] <DunceCotus> KatrinValerie: yeah
[12:45:32] <KatrinValerie> Have I ever said that rent is theft?
[12:45:51] <DunceCotus> Property is theft
[12:45:54] <KatrinValerie> Well, rent is frigging theft and your landlords are criminal
[12:45:57] <KatrinValerie> DunceCotus: agreed
[12:46:04] <amigojapan> money is a nessesary evil KatrinValerie
[12:46:49] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: I think that is a subjective thing
[12:46:53] <KatrinValerie> necessary for what?
[12:47:08] <KatrinValerie> There are people who live without money
[12:47:30] <KatrinValerie> Most not by choice though
[12:47:31] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: if you trace back the roots of moneyk, they were just "Iowe you notes" maded as a tool for bartering
[12:47:37] *** Quits: Urchin[emacs] (~user@user/urchin) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[12:48:06] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: historically there have been societies that instead of having the concept of trade, had the concept of sharing.
[12:48:08] <amigojapan> I owe you notes*
[12:48:23] <DunceCotus> money is the result of a socius that operates on infinite debt
[12:48:40] <amigojapan> I see KatrinValerie, yeah, that is good, but probably cant scale up as big as we have gotten
[12:48:44] <KatrinValerie> So I don't think money is fully needed
[12:49:19] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: you are already looking at this from a capitalistic angle, who says we need to scale, this is already an ideological argument then.
[12:49:30] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: when you say "withouhgt money" you mean also withouhgt bartering?
[12:49:51] <KatrinValerie> Like I said, yes
[12:50:02] <amigojapan> ok
[12:50:03] <KatrinValerie> There are societies that simply agree to take care of each other
[12:50:18] <amigojapan> thats nice
[12:50:20] <KatrinValerie> people just voluntarily help each other when there are no hostile factors
[12:50:30] <amigojapan> but not practical for  modern man
[12:50:35] <KatrinValerie> I think there are still african tribes living it today
[12:50:54] <KatrinValerie> Ubuntu got its name from the concept
[12:51:11] <KatrinValerie> it probably isn't there in a fully pure form though
[12:51:16] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: yeah, maybe if we go to live with a tribe it may work
[12:51:33] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: I personally believe that we can atleast build a society that is more focused on cooperation than on ROI.
[12:51:38] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: industrial production and distribution means we already have economies of scale, we are no longer concerned with attaining surplus but rather private accumulation of that surplus
[12:51:52] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: it takes more resources and energy to keep money in this context
[12:51:57] <KatrinValerie> Doing things that benefit society instead of doing things that make money
[12:52:11] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: I think our current society is based on the idea that everyone is an asshole
[12:52:24] <KatrinValerie> eg mandating that fast fashion be compostable and recycled
[12:52:26] <KatrinValerie> xD
[12:52:32] <DunceCotus> well we have been produced as assholes
[12:52:51] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: I think our society is what creates assholes mostly
[12:52:51] <DunceCotus> with this individualising and shame-inducing social production
[12:53:05] <KatrinValerie> There may be people that are naturally born to be arseholes
[12:53:09] <KatrinValerie> but idk
[12:53:20] <KatrinValerie> In general people can learn to be decent to each other
[12:53:46] <DunceCotus> there is no person who is not a product of capitalism
[12:54:05] <DunceCotus> capitalism produces this split bicameral ego 
[12:54:20] <DunceCotus> which ceaselessly tries to form identities
[12:54:45] <KatrinValerie> You can certainly say that our capitalistic society and its pressure are to blame for a lot of mental distress and disorders.

[12:55:25] <KatrinValerie> In many senses, I mean society kind of defines what is considered disordered in the first place.

[12:56:10] <DunceCotus> KatrinValerie: well capitalism is a schizophrenic process

[13:00:35] <KatrinValerie> No constituation of a democratic nation was written by a single author.
[13:00:57] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: I think we should at least try to improve things were we can.

[13:03:57] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: yeah, in kibbutz they have like hsares homes, shared cars, guaranteed food, and the kibutz pays for medical assistance, in the place I saw a documentary about, but you need to freeze your assets when you join
[13:04:03] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: I think I will start to do some urban farming, growing small crops on hydroponics
[13:04:24] <KatrinValerie> if I can make maintance costs low, it might even save some money
[13:04:30] <KatrinValerie> especially with the exploding food prices
[13:04:32] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie:hydroponnics have always sounded interesting to me
[13:05:12] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: I have some prior experience with it, if you want to use mineral fertilizers you will have to have some laboratory experience though.
[13:05:27] <MootPoot> LOL
[13:05:31] <KatrinValerie> But there is organic hydroponics which is safe for a layperson to run
[13:05:33] <MootPoot> you can still book a hotel in ukraine 
[13:05:37] <MootPoot> lmaoooooooooooooooooo
[13:05:51] <amigojapan> I see KatrinValerie
[13:05:57] <KatrinValerie> MootPoot: why would that be funny?
[13:06:54] <MootPoot> because either they are unironically still taking bookings, or somebody forgot to shut it down
[13:06:55] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: with mineral hydroponics you need to carefully adjust pH values and other things, organic nutrition is a bit more forgiving as it acts as its own buffer solution when properly set up
[13:07:32] <KatrinValerie> adjusting pH levels in mineral fertilizer hydroponics uses dangerous acids and lyes amigojapan.
[13:07:44] <KatrinValerie> That is why I said you should have lab experience
[13:07:49] <amigojapan> MootPoot: life goes on even during war
[13:07:56] <KatrinValerie> You need to know how to safely handle these chemicals
[13:08:07] <amigojapan> I see KatrinValerie
[13:08:27] <KatrinValerie> Chemistry is very dangerous when you are not properly informed and instructed.
[13:08:57] <MootPoot> amigojapan: I know amigo, I've spent some time close to a warzone 
[13:09:04] <MootPoot> its just that the idea is funny
[13:09:13] <MootPoot> "Hey, we're at war but dont worry you can still book"
[13:09:26] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: there are many things that can go wrong, in the past I was a bit naive about how 'easy' it is to adhere to safefy guidelines, but its really a bit more complicated and many people will not take proper precautions.

[13:09:57] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: I almost used methanol as a hand sanitizer by mistake when the pandemic started

[13:54:21] <Bco1981> just not so much as other people in the morning.
[13:54:27] <amigojapan> ah ok Bco1981,then I dont think you need to worry
[13:54:55] <Bco1981> i have to remember to go in the morning, before leaving for work. so i don't suddenly feel like it out in traffic.

[14:06:36] <amigojapan> MootPoot: its 30 percent off only today
[14:07:22] <MootPoot> this is a gas one
[14:08:01] <MootPoot> you have to keep buying gas cylinders to make it run
[14:08:11] <MootPoot> and it loses power over time
[14:08:16] <amigojapan> it says "manual" in the desciption, which ButterNoodle interpreted as spring loaded
[14:09:03] <amigojapan> MootPoot: does it develop leaks?
[14:09:50] <MootPoot> I I'm not 100% sure but when I search that same model on the english websites it says it is gas powered
[14:09:53] <MootPoot> but the price is about 100 usd
[14:10:06] <MootPoot> amigojapan: the gas ones eventually fail to seal properly
[14:10:15] <MootPoot> then become useless
[14:10:27] <MootPoot> this one is 30 so it might be a springer idk
[14:10:28] <amigojapan> I see, MootPoot, I think maybe airsoft is cheaper in Japan
[14:10:35] <MootPoot> most springers I've had have broken on me
[14:10:42] <MootPoot> over time
[14:10:48] <amigojapan> I see
[14:11:12] <MootPoot> but a "good" one that I would call good would be an electric one

[14:12:57] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I bet I will grow tired of it anyway really quickly
[14:13:00] <MootPoot> I just translated it
[14:13:03] <MootPoot> this is a springer
[14:13:12] <amigojapan> I see
[14:13:27] <MootPoot> you have to repull the string every time you shoot
[14:13:42] <amigojapan> spring sounds like it may be less powerful, and thus less dangerous
[14:13:52] <amigojapan> thats ok
[14:13:52] <MootPoot> as for teh mouse dock - its expensive but its worth it 
[14:14:15] <amigojapan> I am ok with coking my gun
[14:14:15] <MootPoot> the price of two usb extension cables for my dongles is about 15 dollars
[14:14:36] <MootPoot> and then I would still need to charge my mouse with a cable
[14:14:49] <MootPoot> so in effect this works like a usb hub and a mouse charger for me
[14:15:56] <amigojapan> ah gotcha MootPoot
[14:16:11] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I did not catch that it was also a usb hub
[14:16:26] <MootPoot> the other cables are just bare cables as well so they just dangle around

[14:18:18] <MootPoot> but otherwise if it was just the mouse you would be right, it is overpriced
[14:18:22] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I think I now unedrtsnad why many people said "bluetooth gives ne blue balls"
[14:18:28] <MootPoot> its true lol
[14:18:34] <MootPoot> bluetooth is really fiddly
[14:18:43] <amigojapan> ouch
[14:18:51] <MootPoot> Its a lot better now but its still bad compared to what it used to be
[14:19:26] <amigojapan> MootPoot: maybe I hsould just get a usb C to USB female adapter
[14:19:34] <amigojapan> and plug in a real keyboard
[14:20:01] <amigojapan> altho I was liking this keyboard if it just connected
[14:23:49] <amigojapan> it connects fine to my phone, so I think the problem is with the tablet
[14:25:21] <amigojapan> Bco1981: I keep on drinking tea or coffee while I am on IRC so I keep on needing to pee every 20 minutes. I wonder how it would be in golf. I am also dying to pee after a movie, but I drink something during the movie too
[14:25:39] <amigojapan> I can just about watch a 2 hour movie by holding out
[14:26:06] <Bco1981> i drink when i eat. then maybe a few glasses after dinner.
[14:26:41] <amigojapan> Bco1981: my doctor said I should drink 3 litters od water pper day
[14:26:48] <Bco1981> wow

[14:29:57] <amigojapan> Bco1981: apparently my kindneys are not very good and the only thing I can do to help them is drink a tonne of water

[14:33:42] <MootPoot> I have the weirdest bug
[14:33:49] <MootPoot> Bco1981: have you ever had this happen
[14:34:09] <MootPoot> so I mapped the left and right arrow keys to my mouse for imageglass right
[14:34:19] <MootPoot> so I can change pictures with only the mouse
[14:34:26] <MootPoot> without clicking
[14:34:31] <MootPoot> but...
[14:34:44] <MootPoot> my mouse has different profiles for every application
[14:35:11] <MootPoot> so it works perfectly, then 1.) if I switch to a different application and back to imageglass quickly, it works fine 
[14:35:53] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I may transfer  my data form the laptop broken screen ssd to the pc using that, but if I am not lazy, it would be cheper to just add the ssd to the inside of the PC
[14:36:21] <MootPoot> 2.) if I switch to a different application, long enough for the profile to change and then I go back to imageglass and press the hotkey before the profile changes - it goes to the default startup imageglass image
[14:36:39] <MootPoot> then it wont let me change anything else, it acts like I opened up a new instance with only that image
[14:36:56] <MootPoot> I fixed it by turning off the "show default image" option in imageglass, but now
[14:37:27] <MootPoot> 3.) if I use the hotkey too quickly then it goes to the default image, then I press it again and then it goes back to the set of images it was supposed to display
[14:37:33] <MootPoot> I have no idea why
[14:37:39] <Bco1981> nope, haven't had that happen... i don't use any remapping tools other then for mapping to a gamepad.
[14:37:59] <Bco1981> usually for some game that does not support gamepad out of the box.
[14:38:05] <MootPoot> now I just have to see that default image every single time
[14:38:16] <MootPoot> but with an extra button press it goes away
[14:38:16] <MootPoot> idk
[14:38:33] <Bco1981> but why don't you just use the standard mouse back and forth clicks on the mouse ?
[14:38:43] <Bco1981> no remmaping needed.
[14:38:50] <Bco1981> remapping*
[14:39:33] <MootPoot> there is no standard back or forth
[14:39:52] <MootPoot> like, for windows explorer or browsers I need to do ctrl + arrow left/right
[14:40:01] <MootPoot> but for imageglass its only the left/right
[14:40:18] <Bco1981> your mouse don't have the thumb "browser back/forth" buttons on the side ?
[14:40:36] <Bco1981> they work in imageglasse
[14:40:36] <MootPoot> no, its a mmo mouse with 12 side buttons
[14:41:06] <Bco1981> well the "standard" back/forth buttons for a browser is the same for imageglass.
[14:41:30] <MootPoot> when I do control + arrow it just says "loading image" then stays on the same image
[14:41:30] <MootPoot> so idk
[14:41:52] <Bco1981> they map it to page up/down instead?
[14:42:15] <Bco1981> `then*
[14:42:15] <MootPoot> oh, there is an option
[14:42:20] <MootPoot> I just changed it to mousewheel

[20:12:09] <JesseDesu> i've had strange dreams about this stuff for well over 10 years
[20:12:26] <JesseDesu> pokhu, i have bipolar 1
[20:12:36] <pokhu> is that related?
[20:12:46] <JesseDesu> when i get manic i feel like i am god
[20:12:48] <JesseDesu> or godlike
[20:12:56] <pokhu> my sister had bipolar
[20:13:01] <pokhu> i mean still has
[20:13:21] <JesseDesu> last time that happened i got paranoid that another higher god was gonna punish me or kill me
[20:13:32] <JesseDesu> 1 or 2
[20:13:36] <pokhu> im not sure
[20:13:37] <JesseDesu> 1 is more severe

[20:18:45] <pokhu> yeah schizophrenia seems pretty scary

[20:20:25] <JesseDesu> what if the voices are telling you that going to the doctor is going to be bad
[20:20:51] <pokhu> id just go to the doctor anyway
[20:21:00] <pokhu> its like a probability thing
[20:21:21] <pokhu> i mean im much more afraid of listening to it

[20:26:39] <JesseDesu> and like 6 psychs

[20:26:59] <Toadisattva> how do your therapists propose you deal with these intrusive stimuli?
[20:27:02] <JesseDesu> i changed insurance a lot
[20:27:04] <pokhu> is that the difference 
[20:27:16] <pokhu> im not sure what it was

[20:28:14] <JesseDesu> i take it every day

[20:28:21] <JesseDesu> its a good med
[20:28:30] <pokhu> looks good then 
[20:28:41] <pokhu> did you tell them about the dreams
[20:29:54] <Toadisattva> therapist is someone who practices psychotherapy, this can be a psychologist, social worker, counselor, etc. psychatrist is a medical doctor that can prescribe medication and is trained in mental health specifically, psychologist can provide psychotherapy but also can be involved more in the research side of things clinical vs counseling psychology

[20:31:13] <pokhu> ???
[20:31:16] <pokhu> seems random
[20:31:20] <pokhu> is it because you cant sleep properly
[20:31:21] <JesseDesu> i'll get a dream about burning up
[20:31:39] <pokhu> i never had anything like that 
[20:31:49] <pokhu> with all my dreams i dont even notice i was dreaming until afterwards
[20:31:52] <JesseDesu> if i try to compress 8 hours of sleep into 4, or even 2 
[20:32:10] <pokhu> its like ill wake up and brush my teeth and i realise i had memorise of brushing my teeth in the morning recently
[20:32:20] <pokhu> but the last time i brushed my teeth was in the night so that couldntve worked

[20:32:56] <JesseDesu> i'll wake up strangely refreshed

[21:29:19] <isekaijin> When I do a fresh Arch Linux install, I know I have to manually unmute the channels I want to use.
[21:29:31] <isekaijin> But you have probably already tried that.
[21:29:45] <Bco1981_2> did you read what i wrote ?
[21:30:19] <Bco1981_2> how would i know i have to do that? i expect things to work as a standard.
[21:30:29] <Bco1981_2> not that you have to fix things to get stuff to work
[21:30:31] <isekaijin> Yeah, but it's not like I'm super knowledgeable about Linux audio myself.
[21:31:37] <isekaijin> Besides, I don't really know what Debian's defaults are or anything. Each distro really does its own thing.
[21:31:52] <Bco1981_2> alsamixer says it's not muted
[21:35:39] <isekaijin> Mmm, that's weird. So ALSA is detecting your computer's sound card, and the Master channel is unmuted, but no sounds are coming out...

[21:38:20] <Bco1981_2> headphones work with my phone.
[21:38:23] <isekaijin> What I would do is try USB headphones that don't rely on the computer's sound card. (They just receive the digital data and convert that data to sound on their own.) Do you have such headphones available?
[21:38:28] <isekaijin> Oh, wait.
[21:38:33] <isekaijin> Are you using headphones?
[21:38:39] <isekaijin> Then I think I know what might be wrong.
[21:38:47] <Bco1981_2> minijack headphones yes
[21:38:50] <isekaijin> In alsamixer, press F6.
[21:39:06] <isekaijin> Your headphones might be acting as if they were their own sound card.
[21:39:39] <isekaijin> See if your headphones appear as a separate sound device.

[21:40:24] <Bco1981_2> they are a separet channel, it said muted... testing
[21:40:32] <isekaijin> No, no, I don't mean a separate channel.
[21:40:36] <isekaijin> I mean a separate sound card.

[21:41:42] <Bco1981_2> F6 gives me, the intel "Via" chipset and nvidia. the intel is selected, as i would assume the nvidia is the hdmi to the monitor... and that won't play either.
[21:41:48] <isekaijin> Mmm.
[21:42:27] <isekaijin> Okay, if your headphones don't appear as a separate sound card, then my original suspicion is wrong.
[21:45:16] <teus> usb headphones are a separate sound card alright
[21:45:38] <Bco1981_2> that was minijack headphones.
[21:45:45] <isekaijin> Ah.
[21:46:25] <isekaijin> I had to google what ‚Äúminijack‚Äù means.
[21:46:33] <Bco1981_2> now i plugged in my daughters USB Logitech G733, it showed up immediatly, and selecting it now there is sound.
[21:46:40] <teus> "stuff" can happen too with detection if something is plugged in
[21:46:52] <teus> if the nvidia/HDMI output does nothing, you got serious issues
[21:47:15] <Bco1981_2> well... then debian has serious issues with sound.
[21:47:27] <Bco1981_2> brand new install, and no sound.
[21:47:34] <teus> so are you on PULSE or ALSA
[21:47:35] <Bco1981_2> worked in windows just before.
[21:47:49] <isekaijin> No idea, I don't use Debian.
[21:48:01] <isekaijin> I could try it on a virtual machine right now, though.

[21:58:27] <Bco1981_2> teus, yeah it has 6 minijack, plugs for the mic, speaker/line out, then the surround stuff like most pc's these days.
[21:59:01] <teus> maybe the sound driver selects the wrong output for the onboard audio by default
[21:59:12] <teus> config problem rather than a driver error

[22:15:58] <ButterNoodle> 4090 when
[22:16:18] <ButterNoodle> but linux drivers for nvidia have always been shit
