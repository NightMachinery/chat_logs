[01:11:35] <ash_worksi> purplex: escaping everything
[01:11:52] <ash_worksi> I was hoping there might be a way to flip escaping, actuallly

[01:13:47] <purplex> Well regex is usually not clear until you can read what it is
[01:14:17] <purplex> You can stick to \Q .. \E version.
[01:14:57] <ash_worksi> yeah
[01:15:17] <purplex> Or, the problem could be something else, if you re-define problem we can write a better regex
[01:15:37] <ash_worksi> naw, it was just a preference thing
[01:16:46] <purplex> Look if you literally want to match the sentence "isset($" and ") ||" there's no other magic.
[01:17:25] <ash_worksi> tbh, I was hoping there was some magic that would enable an unescaped character sequence with an escaped one; like `!isset($\{\w+}) ||`; but yeah, I already knew it was a long shot
[01:17:33] <ash_worksi> just thought I'd ask
[01:17:34] <ash_worksi> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[02:15:29] <jargon_> T{1,2} are spacial, G[A-Z]{1} are temporal.

[10:57:47] <purplex> I still prefer technical one though, the 'restated' explanation is kinda 'personal' to every regexer how they say it.
[10:59:06] <Me-me> Yes, you have to adapt your lexicon to the person you're talking to. This is something that happens all the time, but few people really think about. And when someone is incapable of it, either by not having the ability to do it or not knowing the words to do it, that's when miscommunications happen.
[10:59:31] <Me-me> Of course that also just assumes good intentions for all parties.

[17:19:25] <re101-wombat-95> how can i make this ignore the case sensitive?
[17:19:27] <re101-wombat-95> ^https?://([^\r\n\t\f\v <>{}]*)
[17:19:49] <Me-me> There are a few ways.
[17:20:10] <Me-me> The way compatible with the most different flavours and implementations is just to put (?i) at the start. But that still might not work.
[17:20:24] <re101-wombat-95> just the http section
[17:20:47] <re101-wombat-95> ohh let me try
[17:20:50] <Me-me> Well the others can't have case sensitivity or insensitivity so that just works out.
[17:24:37] <re101-wombat-95> it worked out!!!
[17:26:18] <digitok> you could simplify your character class to [^\s<>{}]

[17:48:41] <Me-me> wombat: I'm not familiar with angular, no.
[17:48:58] <Me-me> Looks like it might use javascript.
[17:49:22] <Me-me> Which is indeed one of the flavours of regex that doesn't have (?i)
[17:50:40] <Me-me> So does your regex look sort of like "const regEx = new RegExp ('^https?://([^\r\n\t\f\v <>{}]*)', 'g')"?
[17:52:11] <Me-me> If that's the format angular uses, just change the 'g' to a 'gi' (or put 'i' where 'g' would have been) and it'll work fine. To put it another way, while keeping in mind that I got that format out of 5 seconds of googling so it might be inaccurate, the spot in that formatting with 'g' is where you would put the "flags" like 'i' which is case insensitivity.
[17:54:01] <re101-wombat-95> it was originally this way "const reg = " ^https?://([^\r\n\t\f\v <>{}]*)"; "
[17:54:21] <Me-me> Okay well...
[17:55:20] <Me-me> This is a bit beyond regex itself, and more to do with the implementation. You're basically looking for some way in your language to use flags aka modifiers, and i is the modifier you want.
[17:55:31] <Me-me> digitok is better at this sort of tailored approach.
[18:02:23] <re101-wombat-95> thanks!
[18:14:42] <digitok> 07re101-wombat-95, if you didn't get it yet, paste the line where that variable is used
[18:16:50] <re101-wombat-95> i did this
[18:16:54] <re101-wombat-95> const rej = RegExp("^https?://([^\r\n\t\f\v <>{}]*)", "i");
[18:17:36] <re101-wombat-95> i think it worked out
[18:17:50] <digitok> yep
[18:18:00] <Me-me> !Me-me
[18:18:00] <perlbot> <Me-me> I don't know programming languages, just regex.
[18:18:04] <Me-me> Haha nifty.
[18:18:44] <re101-wombat-95> thanks a lot!!
[18:19:27] <digitok> you might want to double check that you don't need extra escapes there
[18:20:17] <digitok> test against http://testrtest
[18:20:50] <digitok> http://atest
[18:20:53] <digitok> rather
[18:32:40] <re101-wombat-95> it seems that it's ok
