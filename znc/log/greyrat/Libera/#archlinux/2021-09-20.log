[05:44:01] <thurstylark> yeah, the firmware doesn't know or care where you've mounted your esp in the booted system
[05:44:22] <thurstylark> it cares relative to the root of the partition that's marked with the efi type uuid
[05:44:37] <thebombzen> yea, I just don't want it to put it in the wrong place
[05:44:52] <thurstylark> you're not putting anything anywhere with this tool
[05:45:16] <thurstylark> you're just creating an entry in a database that points to the thing to boot
[05:45:33] <thurstylark> putting the thing to boot in the right place was (hopefully) already done by grub-install
[05:45:42] <thebombzen> ah so if I do "cd /boot" and then use a relative path that's ideal

[07:15:42] <thebombzen> thurstylark: apparently I had another hurdle I had to cross, that I didn't see documented anywhere
[07:16:04] <thebombzen> my BIOS refused to look in the portable location, that is EFI\BOOT\BOOTX64.EFI
[07:16:22] <thebombzen> and it refused to configure itself so I had to pick the EFI location every time
[07:16:47] <thebombzen> apparently, I fixed this by copying that file to EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw.efi
[07:17:01] <thebombzen> which is where windows installs its EFI file. and my BIOS automatically checked that location and found it.
[07:17:11] <kevr> Fucking Microsoft.
[07:17:18] <thebombzen> well, this is not microsoft's fault
[07:17:23] * kevr has encountered that issue before on one of his previous laptops
[07:17:27] <kevr> thebombzen: Yes, it is.
[07:17:35] <thebombzen> how is this not HP's fault for checking the windows location only and not the portable location
[07:17:47] <kevr> thebombzen: It's both of their faults. Microsoft has partnerships with OEMs.
[07:17:50] <thebombzen> since HP's the hardware manufacturer
[07:18:04] <kevr> Allowing that to be a legit method of implementing UEFI is ridiculous.
[07:18:16] <thebombzen> I don't think it's fair to blame MS for choosing a nonstandard location for their EFI, considering that grub does the same thing
[07:18:28] <sheep> that technically goes against the UEFI spec
[07:18:33] <kevr> ^
[07:18:52] <sheep> the UEFI spec says that it should implement Boot* variables and put the EFI executables anywhere on an ESP
[07:19:12] <thebombzen> Yea, and I set the boot variables, but it appears by BIOS ignores them
[07:19:25] <thebombzen> and simply checks the location where microsoft puts its efi executable
[07:19:42] <thebombzen> I don't think I can blame MS for that, but I can blame HP for that
[07:20:00] <sheep> none of the 4 UEFI systems I used had that problem
[07:20:13] <sheep> a Dell laptop, an MSI motherboard, a Gigabyte motherboard, and an Asus laptop
[07:20:19] <thebombzen> this is an old computer. UEFI is still marked as "experimental"

[07:51:50] <thebombzen> idk, you just seem like the kind of person who doesn't believe problems are real
[07:52:00] <MacGyver> Have you *looked* at my nickname?
[07:52:08] <thebombzen> I don't see how that's relevant
[07:52:09] <MacGyver> Problems are real. You're definitely having a problem.
[07:52:48] <thebombzen> when I rebooted out of the archiso and into the system I had just installed and the ethernet was not up, you yelled at me to switch ethernet cables, as though rebooting broke the cable like what
[07:52:55] <MacGyver> All I'm saying is that your diagnosis is quite likely to be wrong, and the remedy you just put on the wiki is far from optimal, also considering that it won't work if there *are* EFI variables.
[07:53:16] <kevr> However, I did have experience installing on quite a many EFI systems. In this particular laptop, the *only* EFI entry that would appear as bootable in the UEFI config was the Windows stub path. I worked around it by literally moving my windows stub over to another filename, putting grub in windows stubs' place, then setting up grub to load the moved to stub for Windows.
[07:53:50] <thebombzen> MacGyver: well I find your skepticism to be unfounded
[07:53:53] <kevr> It would literally show no other entries that I added with efibootmgr.
[07:54:20] <NetSysFire> you know, your edit in the wiki will have a much lower chance of being undone if you added a source to that, e.g a post in the forums where another user has this problem
[07:54:20] <thebombzen> my case it wouldn't even let me add other entries. it *would* let me delete existing ones but they'd be wiped on reboot
[07:54:39] <MacGyver> Re: your ethernet: Yeah, because you know what, you're on a laptop and ethernet cables are moved around all the f*ing time and you'd be surprised how often a cable with a bad core still intermittently connects.
[07:55:07] <MacGyver> I wasn't exaggerating that this has bitten me 10 times, either when providing support to someone else or myself.
[07:55:09] <thebombzen> NetSysFire: is two users in #archlinux, one with a lot of experience not enough information
[07:55:09] <kevr> However, I can't actually say if that's a problem; because it was so long ago, I don't have information about the hardware.
[07:55:17] <MacGyver> kevr: Shame.
[07:55:39] <thebombzen> cause, we have two different people who had the same problem fixed in the same way, right here
[07:55:44] <NetSysFire> thebombzen: edits adding random information to the wiki without a source are likely to be undone
[07:55:56] <NetSysFire> "it happened in irc" is not something you put in a link to a source
[07:56:03] <NetSysFire> irc is basically transient, too
[07:56:11] <thebombzen> well then how am I supposed to cite this? (I figure it's logged publicly)
[07:56:16] <NetSysFire> its not
[07:56:31] <NetSysFire> linking to random irc logs wouldnt be considered a good source either
[07:56:46] <NetSysFire> having e.g a forum post or an issue somewhere with ample information will suffice though
[07:56:49] <kevr> thebombzen: The only real way to cite it would be to point to specific hardware that can reproducibly cause the problem. This is at least proof.
[07:57:03] <kevr> or, evidence on one system, at least.
[07:57:13] <thebombzen> HP Probook 6550b is the computer I'm using
[07:57:27] <kevr> thebombzen: But you need to without a doubt prove that is the issue.
[07:57:33] <MacGyver> kevr: I wonder if the efivars could be forced writable somehow, though (semi-)bricked systems lie in that direction.
[07:58:02] <thebombzen> sure, fine, undo my edit I suppose but then someone else is gonna just have the same problem

[07:59:24] <kevr> MacGyver: It seemed to me like it was really a UEFI firmware with boot options issue. I believe that the firmware in the laptop was only searching for the windows stub. The efi entries always remained; say, if I booted into a live iso again and checked on them. They would just never show up in the UEFI config or boot menu.

[20:39:40] <earnestly> techvio: -bin packages imply it is precompiled so that you don't have to build anything locally, -git and non-git packages are built from source.  Generally building from source is prefered as -bin usually exists for closed source software or large builds

[22:26:34] <mpan> You may always postpone kernel update by using `--ignore` during `pacman -Syu`. While that will be a partial upgrade and partial upgrades are unsupported, kernel will usually be forgiven, as this is something many people do and it normally doesn’t affect much unless you also update some third party kernel modules.
[22:26:51] <Mathisen> i will try to keep in mind that it is a good plan to reboot everytime there is a kernel updatr from now

[22:44:45] <remanifest> Hello, I recently took over an AUR package, and have updated the PKGBUILD with the changes I made. I'm running into an issue when I try to push the package. git returns "Permission denied (publickey)". I've added the public key to my AUR profile, and have edited ~/.ssh/config to use the appropriate IdentityFile. I got blocked from the AUR for a day before, so I'm just trying to figure out what I may be doing wrong.
