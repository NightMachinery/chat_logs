[01:52:04] <bougyman> Oi. Anyone know of a tool that can take a giant pcap and extract a stream? I know the packet the stream starts at.
[01:52:13] <bougyman> But wireshark just can't open the pcap. It's too big.
[01:52:27] <bougyman> And i can only cut a little bit off the front, not enough to make it small enough for wireshark to load.

[06:18:40] <breadpudding> Good evening everyone! I'm having a strange issue with my desktop when I add a second NVMe drive. When the drive is inserted, it prevents the system from booting. It seems to be because my root partition moves from nvme0n1p2 to nvme1n1p2. I'm able to get past GRUB but it seems to lock up after the filesystem check. Any ideas? Thanks in advance.
[06:19:15] <sheep> breadpudding: switch to using UUIDs instead of /dev nodes
[06:19:28] <morrigan> breadpudding: how are you mounting in fstab? you should use uuids
[06:19:38] <morrigan> nvm, sheep got you
[06:19:45] <hanna> typically always a bad idea to use /dev nodes since they can change
[06:19:54] <sheep> in fstab and in the bootloader configuration
[06:19:56] *** Quits: tsal (~tsal@user/tsal) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[06:20:39] <hanna> you can use `genfstab -U` to gen with UUIDs
[06:20:49] <breadpudding> That's what's confusing me, I *am* using UUIDs in /etc/fstab.
[06:21:02] <hanna> what about your boot loader config
[06:21:02] <thrice> and in grub config?
[06:21:17] <breadpudding> Honestly, I haven't checked that yet. Give me a second.
[06:24:21] <breadpudding> As far as I can see, it looks like it's using the UUID as well.
[06:25:07] <hanna> what's the error booting gives when you try to boot?
[06:25:23] <breadpudding> It doesn't, it just hangs.
[06:25:44] <breadpudding> Also just in case it matters(which it most certainly does), I'm using the zen kernel.
[06:26:02] *** Quits: zeden (~zeden@user/zeden) (Quit: WeeChat 3.0.1)
[06:27:10] <hanna> no error message or anything? grub doesn't drop you into a recovery shell or anything?
[06:28:07] <breadpudding> I see "Starting version <version string>" and "/dev/nvme1n1p2 clean: <filesystem statistics>". Nothing appears after that. I'll try disabling the quiet flag and see what I can find but I'll need to reconnect to IRC on my laptop.

[06:30:44] <hanna> is your OS installed on a NVME?
[06:31:23] <breadpudding> Yes. It's on the first one. The second one I added only started having issues after I added a filesystem to it.
[06:31:35] <hanna> hmm, well that crosses off the idea i had.

[06:32:06] <breadpudding> Removing quiet shows that it's waiting for /sys/subsystem/net/devices/enp3s0. Hopefully it was just me being impatient.
[06:33:12] <hanna> on one hand it could be that, on the other hand i don't think NVMe's should take that long
[06:33:29] <hanna> have you tested the drive in another computer if you have one, to make sure it isn't faulty
[06:33:45] <breadpudding> Oh that's even weirder. It changed my Ethernet device from enp3s0 to enp5s0.

[11:45:04] <kevr> you can pretty much do anything other than something that depends on systemd in the chroot.
[11:45:07] <jmcantrell> but you can't create the symlink in the chroot if the file is already there, and you can't remove it because it's mounted from the outside archiso env
[11:45:15] <kevr> you can
[11:45:32] <kevr> first: the argument to -s creates a soft link, the argument to that doesn't have to exist
[11:45:50] <kevr> second: if you are outside of your chroot, you need to be creating the /mnt/etc/resolv.conf link
[11:45:52] <kevr> not /etc/resolv.conf
[11:46:05] <kevr> you could, however, do it via the root path (/etc/resolv.conf) if you were chrooted in.
[11:46:06] <jmcantrell> when i try to rm it, it says the file is in use
[11:46:18] <kevr> rm what?
[11:47:13] <jmcantrell> in the chroot. you can't rm the existing /etc/resolv.conf because it's mounted from the outside
[11:47:25] <nl6720> just create it from outside
[11:47:31] <kevr> ^
[11:47:37] <kevr> jmcantrell: however...
[11:47:51] <jmcantrell> that makes sense
[11:48:09] <kevr> i would say, for what you want to achieve, you should be creating the symlink as described in the wiki when you are inside of the chroot. you're setting up /etc/resolv.conf for your installed system.

[11:51:57] <nl6720> IMHO symlinking from outside the chroot is simpler

The latest version of pacman is linked against libraries which I don't currently have installed.  I therefore can't use pacman to install anything.  What the best approach to get a working pacman and update this system?
[16:26:45] <CarloWood> pacman -F is explicitly for uninstalled packages.
[16:26:57] <CarloWood> (or all of them)
[16:27:19] <emanuele6> CarloWood: and i asked for an option to limit the result to installed packages in the original question

[16:29:06] <slimefoot> emanuele6: the answer appears to be "no", but then it's also legitimate to ask back why you need that - and it turns out that you don't actually need -F at all - that's classic XY

[18:34:19] <mpan> `export` is probably not needed, but otherwise yes.
[18:34:38] <mpan> I mean: `export quotebrowser` is not needed. PATH is likely needing exporting.
[18:35:12] <sukhman> i defined variable first and then use that name in path. Some were saying variable name should be in capital letter!!?
[18:35:22] <mpan> Technically? No.
[18:36:07] <mpan> Though there is a convention to use UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES for variables to be passed to programs, and lower case to be reserved for locally used vars.
[18:36:19] <slimefoot> convention is to name environment variables in uppercase - and perhaps also readonly variables in scripts

[21:01:37] <oramirite> weirdly, my IPMI interface lists the drive as "ejected" after a bad boot too and I have to remount it

[23:20:12] <lakiluki> that's highly unlikely, but I guess it's a possibility?
[23:20:20] <v3n0m> i mean would that person have access to my passwords?
[23:20:27] <lakiluki> or just get the key from a keyserver you trust
[23:20:28] <lakiluki> in that case, yes
[23:20:39] <lakiluki> if it was to get the encrypted password store

[23:26:07] <lakiluki> v3n0m: there may be a pass option for this, but you could always look at one of the files in `~/.password-store`, run `file` on them and match the key id with one of the keys in `gpg --list-keys`
[23:26:10] <mongy> v3n0m: the file .gpg-id
[23:26:31] <lakiluki> or that, seems like a simpler solution 
[23:27:11] <jonathon> also, encrypting using a key you don't have the secret for will mean you can't access the data any more?

[23:34:08] <lakiluki> if you encrypt it with a public key that you don't have a private key for, you can't access it
[23:34:41] <lakiluki> and if you're encrypting with your own key pair, you should be good as long as you're the only person in possesion of the private key
[23:34:50] <DilithiumNO3> that's how asymmetric works after all
[23:35:41] <lakiluki> btw, any ideas for the dead sd card thing? could I somehow debug the driver to figure out what's going on?
[23:36:16] *** Quits: swifteh (~swifteh@user/bsleep) (Quit: Goodbye!)
[23:36:31] <DilithiumNO3> when you encrypt stuff in GPG asymmetrically (-e), it's an "any sender, one recipient" kind of deal
[23:36:48] <DilithiumNO3> the recipient's public key being what you encrypt with
[23:36:56] <DilithiumNO3> as opposed to signatures
[23:37:27] <v3n0m> well, it did say my own key was for it by doing --list-packets

[23:47:36] <jamesp> It looks like EvoWise CDN no longer works. Linux Mint has hidden it from their options and so you guys at Arch should remove it too.
[23:47:38] <jonathon> (likely to be much more efficient than a line-by-line explanation on IRC)
[23:47:54] <jonathon> v3n0m: no, a public key means anyone can encrypt it and you can decrypt it with the secret key
[23:48:04] <jonathon> but only if they have a copy of the public key
[23:48:12] <jonathon> which isn't sent anywhere unless you do so
[23:48:19] <lakiluki> v3n0m: the public key is public only if you share or publish it -- but yeah, reffer to jonathon's point about doing a quick read on the wiki

[23:52:06] <Hello71> some of those tools are super annoying to compile and shit files everywhere
[23:52:19] <Hello71> it's basically the same idea as flatpak/snap/whatever
[23:52:29] <teraflops> sure but isn't a vm a better approach?
[23:52:53] <v3n0m> so it can mess up with ur root files
[23:53:07] <jonathon> yes, but people want to install hacker toolz on their os
[23:53:17] <jonathon> (that was in response to teraflops)
[23:53:23] <lakiluki> Hello71: yeah, but containers are really limiting, especially for security research
[23:54:04] <lakiluki> I can't afford the overhead of a vm, so I just run it on my os, though I don't really use such obscure stuff anyways
[23:54:32] <lakiluki> also, I feel like the majority of tools that come in such distros are often useless

[23:54:59] <lakiluki> and you end up using a tiny fraction of it, while having all of the other bloat stuff installed
[23:55:00] <v3n0m> i mean docker isn't really isolated? so if i install one such os using a docker, my main os files could get messed. If that's what u mean
[23:55:34] <jonathon> lakiluki: very likely. "this distro comes with 25 pre-installed tools" "Well, our distro comes with 50!" "100!" "10000!"
