[00:00:09] <tumn> they can sort of act as object prototypes too, since they are metaprogrammable
[00:00:44] <tumn> (see metatables)
[00:01:13] <ben_> Hey...I love metaprogramming.
[00:02:04] <tumn> lua has good metaprogramming
[00:03:04] <ben_> Great.
[00:03:05] <canardo1> Hi guys, I'm trying to understand this ( http://lua-users.org/wiki/InheritanceTutorial ) and I don't understand why that last part, when implementing 'inheritance':  `if baseclass then ..` is necessary, wouldn't it work fine without that if
[00:03:36] <tumn> there's a great example of metaprogramming
[00:03:37] <tumn> well timed
[00:03:52] <tumn> (lua does not support classes)
[00:06:19] <ben_> tumn: As I mentioned before, I've heard that NetBSD has embedded Lua in their kernel in order to make customization easier. I'm thinking about moving to a BSD, so that was interesting. I knew they wouldn't do this unless Lua was reliable.
[00:06:38] <canardo1> mm it's really cool you can do this, but I don't think I understand completely
[00:08:39] <tumn> lua is reliable by merit of being small and simple
[00:09:10] <tumn> it's also a very old project that's had very few changes over time
[00:09:29] <tumn> it works great as a config language
[00:11:49] <tumn> canardo1: all `if baseClass then` does in that example is checks if baseClass has even been passed, or is non-nil, before calling setmetatable (calling setmetatable with a nil metatable would unset the metatable)
[00:11:58] <tumn> it doesn't strike me as necessary
[00:13:02] <tumn> in fact it appears to do nothing
[00:13:32] <canardo1> Ohh, okay, that makes sense, I wasn't sure if it had anything to do with getting inheritance to work, but yeah, it doesn't really seem to do anything
[00:13:55] <tumn> I don't like that it's called "inheritance"
[00:14:00] <tumn> that's not really what it is
[00:14:55] <tumn> inheritance is class terminology, it's simply setting the __index metamethod of a table (to fall back to returning values from another table)
[00:15:38] <tumn> the :create() thing is just unnecessary added class flavor
[00:17:28] <canardo1> that's kinda necessary if you wanna make instances of this table though, isn't it? Not sure if I'm using the right terminology, I picked up lua very recently
[00:17:50] <tumn> it depends what do you mean by "instances"? clones of the table?
[00:17:57] <tumn> lua has no such feature as instancing
[00:18:21] <tumn> but there are multiple ways to create a prototype of a table
[00:18:26] <tumn> and clone it over and over again
[00:18:49] <tumn> for example a function that returns the table prototype
[00:19:31] <canardo1> which is pretty much what this is doing as well right
[00:19:41] <ben_> Any clone would be an instance. Same thing.
[00:20:05] <canardo1> I guess instance is class terminology too, heh
[00:20:32] <tumn> it is
[00:20:32] <ben_> No. Intance is used in database design
[00:20:46] <Habbie> canardo1, it is
[00:21:07] <tumn> I guess you can call it whatever makes the most sense, I just have a personal pet peeve against people trying to force lua to have classes when it doesn't
[00:21:30] <tumn> that is what it's doing though yea

[21:33:25] <low-key> Are there any resources for complete beginners to programming who want to start with lua?
[21:33:33] <low-key> Most stuff I can find seems to be for python
[21:37:17] <Elw3> programming in lua
[21:37:27] <Elw3> found on lua.org
[21:38:20] <canardo1> I'm not sure how good that is for complete beginners to programming itself though, kinda hard to gauge 
[21:39:52] <low-key> I did take a look at it
[21:39:59] <low-key> It started out basic enough
[21:40:16] <low-key> But it presumes that you already have a basic knowledge of programming which I certainly don't
[21:40:20] <low-key> 🙈
[21:40:41] <low-key> Is there something along the lines of Think Python or Byte of Python but for Lua?
[21:40:54] <low-key> Those two seem to really start from the absolute basics
[21:41:08] <Elw3> Just ask us if you dont get something.
[21:41:17] <Elw3> There really is not that much to learn.
[21:41:22] <low-key> I'm grateful :)
[21:41:31] <low-key> Should I go with Programming in Lua only then?
[21:41:51] <Elw3> Read this https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lua/
[21:41:53] <Elw3> be done
[21:41:55] <Elw3> Profit
[21:43:00] <canardo1> http://lua-users.org/wiki/LuaBooks maybe the first one on here
[21:43:57] <low-key> That sounds nice
[21:43:59] <low-key> Thank you!
