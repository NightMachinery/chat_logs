[17:06:26] <FunkyBob>   flex-flow: row wrap;

[17:14:49] <hassoon> michigan: how about this https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/330
[17:15:18] <hassoon> .vote and .post just simply go under one same parent
[17:15:37] <hassoon> and their parent take up all the space of the flex container

[20:41:16] <michigan> FunkyBob: Seems flex-flow: flow wrap; and flex-wrap: wrap; does the same thing: https://codepen.io/michiganstate/pen/JjNRvEm
[20:41:43] <michigan> hassoon: Any chance you can show how to get the vote and post to be on the same line?

[20:41:58] <michigan> As you can see I tried to clean the HTML up a little, first time I use <article> :)
[20:42:09] <michigan> Rockwood: Ah it was a shorthand, cool
[20:43:29] <Rockwood> give time to doc
[20:43:40] <Rockwood> not to doctor :D
[20:44:09] <michigan> Hahaha
[20:44:23] <michigan> hassoon: It seemed to work just adding display: flex; to .wrapper: https://codepen.io/michiganstate/pen/JjNRvEm
[20:46:40] <Rockwood> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox#the_flex_model
[20:46:45] <Rockwood> see this once
[20:46:58] <michigan> Stunning. Absolutely stunning.
[20:47:14] <Rockwood> The parent element that has display: flex set on it (the <section> in our example) is called the flex container.
[20:47:25] <michigan> Rockwood: Will do. But first gotta celebrate this tremendous achievement :-)
[20:47:45] <Rockwood> then cheers :D
