[00:19:01] <Anarchos> when i do 'opam install cmdliner' it installed from very old cmdliner 1.0.4 source files (version number seems to be stuck at 1.0.4 for cmdliner for months). Is it a way to download some decent revision ?
[00:19:51] <d_bot> <RegularSpatula> That is the latest version on opam
[00:21:58] <Anarchos> regaularSpatula that is my point : a decent revision OF the 1.04...
[00:22:34] <Anarchos> it always reinstall from cached sources which are months old on my machine
[00:25:50] <d_bot> <RegularSpatula> Sorry but I‚Äôm confused with what you mean. If you want a version of cmdliner > 1.0.4 then you would have to install by eg pinning the GitHub repo. 1.0.4 is the latest release on opam so even if you do opam update first, you will still get 1.0.4 from opam
[00:27:16] <Anarchos> RegularSpatula the code of cmdliner evolves on github, but he revision number did'nt change for months (years) so i think it tricks opam in not downloading latest code.

[20:24:19] <d_bot> <monk> it's for the opam package `emacs-conf`

[20:24:34] <d_bot> <NULL> I'm curious
[20:25:02] <d_bot> <monk> opam is smart enough to know what it needs. im running arch and it tells you to install emacs via `pacman -Su`.
[20:25:13] <d_bot> <NULL> The standard way would be to install a dummy `emacs` package, so that `apt` doesn't try to install it from the standard repo (substitude `apt` for your package manager)

[20:33:18] <d_bot> <monk> this still doesn't answer why it wants to install emacs and didn't last time? idk

[20:40:43] <d_bot> <monk> i use arch, it's always going to be aggressive like this for better and worse etc
[20:41:49] <d_bot> <NULL> So do I (manjaro), it has worked nicely until now, granted I don't use the system switch often. I even removed the version requirement in my active switch, that way opam upgrades it when it can
[20:42:36] <d_bot> <monk> going to try and see what happens when i tell it to ignore emacs
[20:42:49] <d_bot> <monk> i'll remove `user-setup` afterwards if it goes well
[20:43:53] <d_bot> <NULL> If the ocaml version mismatch doesn't complain, you should be able to uninstall user-setup without messing with emacs
[20:44:12] <d_bot> <monk> ... `num` failed at `make findlib-install` which feels odious but everything else thus far has installed just fine (500/547)
[20:46:23] <d_bot> <monk> here's the paste for the single error output but it does look like my ocaml-system managed to upgrade after `opam upgrade --update-invariant` (that's the new flag for `--unlock-base`)

[20:46:40] <d_bot> <monk> from what i can tell, it failed because Num was already installed (?) lol
[20:48:18] <d_bot> <monk> i've successfully uninstalled `opam unintsall user-setup tuareg conf-emacs` now too
[20:48:40] <d_bot> <monk> well, i think things are fine for opam's system switch, knock on wood
[20:48:43] <d_bot> <monk> thanks for helping me figure that out

[22:55:54] <d_bot> <antron> is there a way to print to stdout or stderr while also using ppx_expect? i.e. have a part of the output that is not captured by ppx_expect
[23:04:07] <rgrinberg> perhaps surround the part you want discarded with dup2?

[23:18:02] <d_bot> <antron> that might work (note i want it printed to the terminal, not discarded, but i could probably get that somehow)
[23:18:15] <d_bot> <antron> getting by with copying the code out to an example for now
