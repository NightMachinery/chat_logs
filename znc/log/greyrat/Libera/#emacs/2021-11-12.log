[06:23:59] <johnjay> yeah what wgreenhouse

[06:46:29] <grym> wherein emacs kind of can't ... blit ... things ? 
[06:46:36] *** Joins: tybalt (~blah@leela.warped.com)
[06:46:37] <johnjay> yes that's more accurate
[06:46:38] *** Parts: tybalt (~blah@leela.warped.com) ()
[06:46:48] <johnjay> it's like it was designed for a terminal then the gui stuff was kind of tacked on after
[06:46:55] <grym> it was
[06:48:02] <awannaphasch2016> this sadden me. I really think gui is the way for ward eventaully. This is coming from a dude in a research fields and really need emacs to work well with images and alike.
[06:48:23] <johnjay> now it would be the reverse. designed for gui and the terminal would be sort of a hacked minimal major-mode or something
[06:48:26] <awannaphasch2016> what do you not like about gui?
[06:48:33] <grym> i usually use GUI emacs, but i live in a terminal a _lot_ 
[06:48:40] <grym> usually side by side 
[06:48:47] <johnjay> this might sound odd but terminals are more stable
[06:48:47] <grym> and -nw on servers
[06:48:47] <awannaphasch2016> I second that 
[06:48:51] <grym> (i'm also in research) 
[06:48:59] <johnjay> GUI i feel like there's no standardization. so gui can change anytime for any reason
[06:49:09] <johnjay> but a terminal is sort of... dead tech? lol. so it's very stable!
[06:49:10] <awannaphasch2016> fair.
[06:49:37] <grym> i also try to make my wm as terminal-like as i can , come to think of it
[06:49:48] <lockywolf> terminals are in no way dead tech
[06:49:59] <awannaphasch2016> how is terminal a dead tech? I feel like all developers use terminal, and all the complex stuff is left to terminal, no?
[06:49:59] <johnjay> well in the sense nobody cares about them
[06:50:02] <lockywolf> TUI is a dead-tech
[06:50:07] <johnjay> which is a good thing. nobody cares about it means stable means it's consistent
[06:50:18] <awannaphasch2016> TUI is
[06:50:40] <johnjay> tmux is sort of like a minimal TUI and I use that.
[06:51:07] <awannaphasch2016> tmux <3
[06:51:14] <lockywolf> you can run eshell in tramp
[06:51:15] <grym> htop, dive, pudb, litecli, some other tools i use pretty regularly, are all TUI

[07:42:00] <z3t0> is happening because I have the same config on another system and it has no issues. Can anyone suggest how I can start debugging this? I tried googling but I think I'm missing a few too many pieces here to make progress on my own - any help is greatly appreciated

[09:12:35] <Catie> emacs-lucid is built with the lucid toolkit, emacs-gtk is built with GTK

[09:13:11] <Catie> Neither, really. Their performance is comparable
[09:13:46] <Catie> The GTK version has a bug where if you close your X session while emacs is running, it'll dump core. If you find yourself killing X frequently, you might try lucid over GTK

[13:19:10] <empwilli> any specific term theme/config?
[13:19:14] <aidalgol> Hash: Well Doom Emacs isn't a GNU or FSF project.
[13:20:14] <Hash> I use doom emacs (don't ask, but I barely use it. I keep almost everything off/not loaded, and very very tiny few packages I install myself.

[13:20:56] <Hash> So, on doom emacs, just the basic doom-one theme loads and it looks all wrong in urxvt. xterm is fine. Like it used to be. I use urxvt because of a specific reason.
[13:21:10] <perrierjouet> hello all, sorry to ask again what do you think about this article, https://tilde.town/~ramin_hal9001/haskell.html suggesting to rewrite emacs with haskell
[13:21:52] <ChengjunXie> Hash: try to  remove your ~/.Xdefaults temporarily to see if it work find with urxvt
[13:21:53] <perrierjouet> is it possible to work on a "parallel project" without forking per say ?
[13:21:59] <Hash> I think I've learned enough about emacs to not have to rely on doom any longer.
[13:22:08] <Hash> I think I am ready to cuztomize emacs myself.
[13:22:12] <Hash> I think.
[13:22:22] <Hash> ChengjunXie: ok good idea.
[13:22:23] <empwilli> I retry my question from a couple of days ago: I search for a region based upon its text-property and then basically do (delete-region (prop-match-beginning match) (prop-match-end match)) I find that at point the buffer still has this property (eventhough the text is gone) any ideas?
[13:23:06] <Hash> ChengjunXie: you can move the file, but how to tell linux to not load it?
[13:23:11] <Hash> it's already loaded in xrdb
[13:23:38] <Hash> there is an xrdb -remove option hmm.

[17:01:31] <grym> so that'll keep it going 
[17:01:47] <grym> ox-hugo is nicer than any jekyll equivalent i found, though

[17:05:21] <Bayes> or does it work mostly with vanilla hugo setups?
[17:05:29] <grym> Bayes: i've been able to load custom themes and whatnot 
[17:05:37] <Shortstop> Emacs then finds the headline in 'Intercom Tasks' headline
[17:05:59] <Shortstop> It then converts the 'Support Chat' portion of the headline to--> Prompt the user for the Ticket #

[17:07:26] <Shortstop> yep exactly, just in * Intercom Tasks
[17:07:36] <Shortstop> The tasks them selves are in subheadlines aka ** Support Chat with john

[17:09:11] <Shortstop> and manipulate the text within that heading --> Change it to prompt the user for 'Zendesk Ticket #' so that it can replace the heading with --> ** OPEN Ticket #51000 with John :Zendesk_Ticket:
[17:09:36] <TRS-80> I am trying to envision what else is in that file, so we can get the candidate list as quickly / easily as possible.  If this is the only place you will find 'john' for instance, we can use grep which will be faster and easier.  Oh wait are you on Windows?

[17:23:52] <Shortstop> does anyone here use gnus with work email that requires Okta? I'm trying to figure out how I can do this
[17:24:19] <TRS-80> Oh btw using the dotted pair is a little know but supported way to define keys.  Then in which-key your text shows up instead of the function name.
[17:24:36] <hodapp> grym: are you sure this is the same Bob Harper?
[17:24:41] <TRS-80> I have no idea what Okta is, but I do use Gnus.
[17:24:49] <grym> hodapp: i am quite sure that it is not :P
[17:25:02] <TRS-80> But first, let's get back to that custom Elisp
[17:25:07] <TRS-80> So let's assume you just do regular search and end up with point on that headline.  Should be at bol I guess, if not we add that (maybe search goes to end of result).
[17:25:41] <Shortstop> Okta is an SSO client used for work
[17:25:44] <TRS-80> Sounds like you want to change TODO state, but also change the headline text, have I got that right?
[17:25:51] <Shortstop> yeah
[17:26:00] <Shortstop> I pretty much use 'OPEN' etc headline statuses
[17:26:04] *** Joins: trace987 (~trace@ip5b429941.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de)

[17:26:34] <Shortstop> *instead of TODO, so I have them in the '#+TODO:' section at the top*

[17:27:00] <TRS-80> Well I think it's easier to make Elisp function simply to change headline.  Then you just do TODO state change the normal way.  Because if you add LOGBOOK it becomes async.  But anyway...

[17:39:39] <TRS-80> Shortstop: It occurs to me a better way might be to leave the headline alone, and simply add a PROPERTY with TICKET as key, and then change the tag like you said earlier.  Then no custom function required at all.  What do you think?
[17:40:15] <Shortstop> maybe, it seems like a simple regex job to me for some reason
[17:40:43] <TRS-80> It is, but that's not the point.  Rather the point is to do as much within the existing tools as possible.

[22:57:00] <aidalgol> OpenGL over X is pretty useless unless all you're using is a very limited subset of OpenGL.
[22:57:06] <wgreenhouse> it's designed for thinclients on a LAN, and thinclients on a LAN basically showing simple terminals/editors, not video or much else. and audio is completely outside the spec.

[22:58:17] <Catie> rpav: At least for me, my Internet connection is super slow. I can run X11 over a LAN, but not really with wireless connections or over the Internet itself
[22:58:52] <Catie> VirtualGL looks promising, I'll look into it!
[22:58:57] <rpav> ah, if i was connecting remotely i would probably use liek xvnc or whatever but

[22:59:06] <rpav> i haven't actually tried in ages and it might work fine
[22:59:13] <wgreenhouse> and my point was X's whole design is a cluster because of what's actually an edge case addressed by better software
[22:59:28] <wgreenhouse> so there's not much worth keeping
[22:59:46] <rpav> i am fortunate enough to have bandwidth basically everywhere i am; wifi is nearly ubiquitous; 4G+ is fast enoguh for everything; home network is fiber

[23:03:42] <wgreenhouse> rpav: "better software" for the "edge case" meaning actual remote desktop applications that compress video and adjust quality based on conditions
[23:03:46] <rpav> also people tend to think of X as like, "ok it makes windows, but ALL the other stuff is fonts, xrdb, etc", but it's really a _lot_ more, with the font/db/etc stuff as minor and inconsequential

[23:13:03] <rpav> well, it does little useful over X, and its selling feature is "well, it's better," and that's usually an indication of "failure ahead"
[23:13:43] <aidalgol> I mean, Wayland has actual isolation of applications.  I'd say that's pretty major.
[23:14:42] <rpav> yeah these are the sorts of claims that are the ideological "it's BETTER!" that are only better in theory, usually only solve hypothetical issues, and probably don't benefit the majority of potential users
[23:15:03] <rpav> e.g., see Rust evangelism
[23:15:05] <wgreenhouse> it does _less_ than X, which is part of the point (but also perhaps one of the barriers to adoption)
[23:15:09] <wgreenhouse> people say keep X but slim it down, they don't actually mean it
[23:15:33] <rpav> replace X with C++ and Wayland with Rust, and see how many of these arguments apply
[23:15:36] <aidalgol> No, it's not theoretical.  Everyone would benefit from applications not being able to spy on each other.

[23:16:22] <aidalgol> No one here is just saying "IT'S BETTER!!" without giving any concrete reasons.  You're just making a strawman and arguing against *that* instead of any of the points we have raised.

[23:18:40] <rpav> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[23:19:08] <rpav> in any case, opinions are worthless; they won't make wayland any more adopted or X any less adopted
