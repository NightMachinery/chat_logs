[02:58:36] <jtgd> I have (circe-set-display-handler "QUIT" (lambda (&rest ignored) nil)) but I still see Quit messages.
[03:02:49] <jtgd> Is there something else I need to do?
[03:03:20] <wasamasa> > Channel quits are shown already, so just show quits in queries.
[03:03:30] <wasamasa> that's from the docstring of the default quit handler
[03:03:52] <wasamasa> `circe-reduce-lurker-spam' may be what you want instead
[03:04:08] <wasamasa> there's a "channel.quit" event
[03:04:48] <wasamasa> if you for whatever reason want to hide quits only

[03:11:44] <jtgd> I already had reduce-lurker-spam, but I still saw JOIN/QUIT/PART, so I added (circe-set-display-handler "JOIN" (lambda (&rest ignored) nil)) (circe-set-display-handler "PART" (lambda (&rest ignored) nil)) (circe-set-display-handler "QUIT" (lambda (&rest ignored) nil)) and I still get Quit messages
[03:17:38] <jtgd> What is the syntax for handling that "channel.quit" event?
[04:36:32] <jtgd> nvm then, I can live with it.
[04:38:25] <jtgd> new question: is there a command to scroll back to the track-bar?
[10:39:27] <wasamasa> jtgd: same as for handling the "QUIT" event

[13:41:27] <jtgd> I'm having 2 problems atm, 1) I can't connect at all to irc.oftc.net (it just hangs with Connecting...) 2) when I connect to libera I have about 18 channels in the config but it doesn't connect to all of them.
[13:46:09] <wasamasa> hm, weird that you can connect to libera, but not oftc
[13:46:48] <wasamasa> hanging is typically either network issues (DNS) or being on an ancient emacs version which shells out to a gnutls process and fails silently
[13:48:52] <jtgd> it was my first time on that network. I had trouble registering nick so I went over to weechat and completed that. then back and run circe with circe-network-options for oftc and it won't go
[13:50:30] <wasamasa> have you tried irc-debug-log yet?
[13:52:39] <jtgd> no
[13:54:16] <jtgd> is that a file or a command?
[13:54:43] <wasamasa> it's a variable
[13:54:50] <wasamasa> (setq irc-debug-log t)
[13:54:57] <wasamasa> then check the irc buffer
[13:55:08] <wasamasa> it will most likely contain sensitive information like your password
[13:55:56] <wasamasa> anyway, if I launch an emacs instance and do M-x circe RET OFTC RET
[13:56:01] <wasamasa> then the connection succeeds
[13:56:04] <wasamasa> I have no OFTC config
[13:56:18] <wasamasa> if you have OFTC config, make sure it's correct
[13:56:22] <wasamasa> this includes getting the name right
[13:57:15] <wasamasa> like, oftc and OFTC are two different things
[13:57:17] <jtgd> I set it up like libera, with sasl and all.
[13:57:59] <jtgd> Yes, I saw there was OFTC already built-in. my circe-network-options is Oftc and I see both in the list after circe
[13:58:21] <wasamasa> note that it's called "OFTC" there
[13:58:27] <wasamasa> if your config uses "Oftc", that won't match
[13:58:56] <jtgd> how can I delete that list you have in there?
[13:59:24] <jtgd> so it only contains the ones I have in circe-network-options
[13:59:53] <wasamasa> I wouldn't mess with `circe-network-defaults'
[14:00:23] <wasamasa> `circe-networks' though, sure
[14:00:34] <wasamasa> (setq circe-networks nil) or whatever else you want
[14:01:49] <jtgd> should I set that to reasonable values, or just nil?
[14:02:41] <jtgd> it looks like it has some important things in there
[14:02:51] <wasamasa> you can set it to something like '(("OFTC" :nick "jtgd" :pass my-retrieve-irc-password))
[14:03:18] <jtgd> I don't need all that stuff like  :nickserv-identify-challenge ?
[14:03:25] <wasamasa> it's a list of options that take precedence over the `circe-network-defaults' one
[14:04:00] <wasamasa> `circe-networks' should only contain what you need on top of the defaults
[14:04:21] <wasamasa> sorry
[14:04:25] <wasamasa> I mean `circe-network-options'
[14:04:39] <wasamasa> not `circe-networks', that's an alias for `circe-network-defaults'
[14:05:05] <jtgd> I don't touch circe-network-defaults, only circe-network-options
[14:05:05] <jtgd> wasamasa        | `circe-networks' should only contain what you need on top of the defaults
[14:05:24] <wasamasa> you can restore the value of a variable by visiting its location and pressing C-M-x on the definition

[15:54:16] <wasamasa> I'm sure you don't get that when starting out with a vanilla emacs config

[19:49:56] <greyrat>  wasamasa: Any ideas on what packages might be responsible? I have the following minor modes active: https://paste.gnugen.ch/paste/2Kzj , none of which seems obvious. Disabling =font-lock-mode= works, obviously, but that is a nuclear option.
