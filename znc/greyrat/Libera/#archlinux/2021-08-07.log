[14:08:27] <tonitch> in my understanding, /boot is used at boot by grub then it's not really used by the system itself after that (maybe I miss something tho)

[15:28:06] <grawity> it's fine
[15:29:26] <grawity> luks2 supports argon as a KDF (a bit harder to bruteforce than PBKDF2), and has the option to use dm-integrity (to protect against someone actively tampering with your disk), but realistically those probably won't make any difference

[15:30:55] <mongy> cool.  less hassle (for me) when making btrfs full luks with grub (/efi, @)

[15:33:42] <greyltc> doesn't that seem kinda wrong?
[15:34:44] <grawity> tbh if you're packaging a direct fork then it would make sense for provides=(gtk4) to implicitly provide the same version -- but if you're packaging an independent alternative then it wouldn't make sense as the versioning may well be completely different
[15:35:07] <grawity> so I guess pacman takes the safe option, and doesn't assume the provided version unless you explicitly set it
[15:36:20] <mpan> mongy: also be aware that LUKS is providing a layer that defines how to access an encrypted volume — it provides no volume encryption by itself. That is dm-crypt. Security of LUKS is primarily limited to whether it protects keys in the header properly (the answer is: yes, for both header versions). Important distinction if you google for info on that. Perhaps this is why you might have missed the 
[15:36:21] <greyltc> I feel like if a PKGBUILD contains `provides=(THING)`, that should mean the package is a drop-in replacement for THING

[16:26:45] <ShapeShifter499> is there a easily replicable way to find out what architecture my sh script is running on for Arch Linux users?
[16:27:07] <grawity> uh define "easily replicable"
[16:27:18] <NetSysFire> arch linux only supports x86_64 anyways
[16:27:58] <grawity> but in general, you can determine the architecture via $MACHTYPE if you're writing for Bash, $(uname -m) otherwise
[16:28:46] <ShapeShifter499> in the debian package for osk-sdl they have a initramfs hook that looks for what architecture and copies over files depending.   I'd like to recreate that here but they use a variable "$DPKG_ARCH"

[17:00:08] <breadpudding> Hello everyone. I have a strange issue with mounting network shares on boot. I have recently added an NVMe drive to my desktop and that changed the network interface from enp3s0 to enp5s0. Now I have to wait a minute and a half every time I boot because it's waiting for enp3s0 to start existing. Any advice?
[17:00:42] <Namarrgon> adjust your network configs for the new interface name

[17:03:02] <breadpudding> I'm not really sure what to change at this point. I've checked what I could think of so far. It's been a *long* time since I initially installed this system.
[17:03:22] <Namarrgon> which tool manages the network connection?
[17:04:54] <breadpudding> I don't actually know but it's not NetworkManager and it's not systemd. I've been running dhcpcd manually on the network interface to get a connection so it's possible that there's nothing managing it. I'm using CIFS to mount the network shares.
[17:05:13] <Hello71> grep -rF enp3s0 /etc
[17:05:19] <Namarrgon> tree /etc/systemd/system
[17:05:19] <Hello71> i guess the F isn't necessary here
[17:06:49] <breadpudding> grep returns nothing. tree shows a list of services I have enabled. I'm only seeing dhcpcd so it might be a misconfiguration with that.
[17:07:15] <Namarrgon> can you post the output to a paste service?
[17:08:34] <breadpudding> https://pastebin.com/raw/iF67esfe
[17:08:35] <EMIYA> repasted ⇒ https://0x0.st/-4nx.txt
[17:08:58] <grawity> by "seeing dhcpcd" you mean the line "dhcpcd@enp3s0.service -> /usr/lib/systemd/system/dhcpcd@.service", yes?
[17:09:06] <grawity> because it says enp3s0 right there
[17:09:51] <breadpudding> Let me pull up the wiki to see what I may have done. This was my first ever Arch install and that was *years* ago at this point.
[17:10:28] <grawity> more or less just systemctl disable the old .service and enable the new one, with the correct interface in the @instance

[23:37:03] <NakedKing> any suggestion for deadly simple and crop supported image-view app?
