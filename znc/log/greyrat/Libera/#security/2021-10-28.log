[03:10:16] <ghostbuster> how useless is "two step verification" where the 5-digit code is sent to your email address
[03:10:36] <Hash> depends on how secure your email is
[03:10:45] <Hash> if they have access to your email, they can do 2 step
[03:14:00] <piou> Depends. If account recovery uses the email address as well like on 99% of websites then using it as a piece of authentication is legit.
[03:14:24] <piou> Since you're going to rely on it to secure access to the account anyway
[03:16:01] <piou> That said: 5 digit code: why not a proper token where you just click a link to provide it to the API?
[03:16:32] <piou> Also I wonder how difficult it'd be to bruteforce it
[03:17:14] <khyodo> A proper setup would rate limit your request, and it would have to be before the verification expires.

[03:20:47] <khyodo> I wonder if I could brute force OTP in my accound here..
[03:21:15] <Hash> Not enough time.
[03:21:33] <Hash> OTP expiry time prevents that.
[03:21:33] <ajak> well, investigate everybody's and you can eventually find some bug bounties, maybe :)
[03:22:01] <Hash> You have 30 seconds to 5 min tops depending on who it is
[03:22:08] <ajak> well, if the time is a constant then your ability to brute it is probabilistic
[03:22:09] <piou> you probably could, and even with a time limit... well if you can try as many times as you want as for a password recovery you should be able to get an account takeover with conditions

[03:30:25] <khyodo> piou Just tested it, it got throttled, but I'll test with a random human delay and see how that works.
