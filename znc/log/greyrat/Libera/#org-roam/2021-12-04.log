[01:59:37] <peutri> interesting POV
[02:01:06] <peutri> won't deny the ad-hoc; won't debate the fast (either way); seems to me v2 is further from org (specifically because of id links), but I'm not that much in the in-crowd for that
[02:01:41] <peutri> didn't notice it being slower; didn't notice it being more robust but honestly who would
[02:01:51] <peutri> did notice what didn't fit my flow anymore
[02:02:09] <zaeph> â€¦How would it be further from org?
[02:02:13] <peutri> id links
[02:02:26] <zaeph> org-id is a well-established package for creating UUID for headings.
[02:02:37] <peutri> most likely
[02:02:46] <peutri> but i'm discovering it with v2
[02:02:53] <peutri> and i've been with org since... can't remember
[02:03:04] <zaeph> I could grant you that some people take the org model to mean that they can create file-hierarchy-like structure inside a document, but that's something that maintainers have been actively discouraging against.
[02:03:07] <peutri> since it was packaged with emacs
