[01:54:12] <SlimmyJimmy> Klotz Thank You. Yes, I'd like to just perform a brute-force but I think my PC runs out of memory when I try that one. Something about OPEN_CL_HOST_OUT_OF_MEMORY;
[01:58:23] <Klotz> Hm i see
[02:00:25] <Klotz> From my own experience, running the opencl stuff directly from the virtual console is a smoother experience
[02:01:26] <FlorianBad> Common wisdom say we should't call srand(), but what if I forked? If I generate IVs and Argon salts / keys now that becomes something ultra important... So what would be the most robust approach to srand()?

[02:10:13] <SlimmyJimmy> That's the error I've been getting when I provide no dictionary file for input.
[02:10:26] <SlimmyJimmy> immsmc
[02:10:47] <Klotz> Ah
[02:12:12] <Klotz> My windows knowledge is more limited, unfortunately. 
[02:12:29] <SlimmyJimmy> So it's started an attack now and said it requires 843MB but it looks like it's not really doing anything, just printing stuff on the screen because I didn't provide a dictionary file.
[02:12:48] <Klotz> Maybe the os has some kind of resource monitoring service that steps in?
[02:13:21] <SlimmyJimmy> Does hashcat generate every possible combo for me when I provide no dictionary?
[02:13:30] <Klotz> What is the command that you entered
[02:14:06] <SlimmyJimmy> I entered: .\hashcat -m 13400 -a 0 'hash_in_ascii_here';
[02:14:48] <SlimmyJimmy> It says "0 H/s is "Speed #1" its not doing anything but spinning it wheels.
[02:15:23] <SlimmyJimmy> Oh it finally stoped, "No passwor candidates received in stdin mode, aborting'. It took like 2 minutes to figure that out.
[02:16:31] <SlimmyJimmy> I created a password.txt file and put about 30 guesses in it but I'm not getting it right and that works fine with the hashcat. But I'm just gonna have to brute-froce my password. I can't remember it.
[02:16:49] <SlimmyJimmy> How do I just try every combo with alphanumeric and special up to 12 digits?
[02:17:06] *** Quits: joilerv (~joilerv@135.129.250.144) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[02:18:17] <SlimmyJimmy> Is it .\hashcat -m13400 -a 0 -1 ?a?a?a?a?a?a?a?a?a?a?a?a
[02:21:13] <Klotz> SlimmyJimmy: thr ?a?a stuff is a different kind of attack whereby hashcat will generate candidates matching the "pattern" instead of just trying every word from a list.
[02:21:43] <SlimmyJimmy> Okay, I need -a 0 and that's it I think.
[02:22:00] <Klotz> The mode will also have to be set to -a 3 for a masked attack
[02:22:44] <SlimmyJimmy> Why does the -a 0 say "Starting attack in stdin mode'?
[02:22:53] <SlimmyJimmy> I just want the brute-force.
[02:23:18] <SlimmyJimmy> Without providing a list
[02:23:30] <Klotz> You can just write the desired patterns into a file, one by line, then supply it as the second argument. That's how i usually do it
[02:23:55] <Klotz> Then masked attack is what you want
[02:24:18] <SlimmyJimmy> Why not just a brute-force of everything up to 12 characters?
[02:24:27] <SlimmyJimmy> Why can't it just be simple.
[02:25:26] <Klotz> Up to 12 chars is a herculean task
[02:25:51] <Klotz> You'd generally need some serious hardware for that
[02:26:14] <SlimmyJimmy> I got a hexa-core with 7 Compute Units.
[02:26:23] <SlimmyJimmy> AMD 4500U.
[02:27:14] <SlimmyJimmy> I guess it's only 6 Compute Units but still that's pretty good.
[02:27:27] <SlimmyJimmy> 6 CPUs and 6 CUs
[02:27:51] <Klotz> The longest password that i cracked (with my then state of the art alienware) was 8 chars long  (university course login) and i only managed to do it because it matched a pattern of ending in digits.
[02:28:14] <Klotz> It took an entire afternoon still
[02:28:22] <SlimmyJimmy> I can let this PC run for days if I have to, just doing it in low priority state.
[02:28:40] <Klotz> So 6 cpus and 6 gpus?

[02:29:01] <SlimmyJimmy> 1 iGPU.
[02:29:23] <Klotz> Ok that doesn't sound bad
[02:30:25] <Klotz> Still, the reason the "masked attack" exists is because narrowing down the keyspace to likely patterns is always a good idea
[02:31:37] <Klotz> ?a?a?a?a?a?a?a will be a huge haystack to go through compared to ?l?l?l?l?l?d?d
[02:33:41] <SlimmyJimmy> Okay, so the second one is a mask to try to find a password that starts with 4 letters and ends up 2 digits is that right?
[02:34:11] <SlimmyJimmy> But it's lowercase letters
[02:34:38] <SlimmyJimmy> So what if you don't know the lengh, maybe it's 4 to 6 letters to start and 1-3 special characters at the end?
[02:34:55] <SlimmyJimmy> Then you just need a few more masks I guess.
[02:35:27] <Klotz> Yes, that's why i tend to use a file
[02:36:03] <SlimmyJimmy> Yep, I'm gonna need a file. My passwords follow the same pattern sometimes unless I just reuse one that is super easy to remember.
[02:36:26] <SlimmyJimmy> I forgot my KeePass password and I wanna get it back with this hashcat.
[02:36:30] <Klotz> I write down the patterns that i deem most likely for the target i'm working on, then supply the file as an arg
[02:37:01] <SlimmyJimmy> So how would you write a mask for a password that you think is 4 to 6 letters to start and 1-3 digits at the end?

[05:08:32] <Klotz> Yes, that is the purpose of the hashing algos
[05:08:37] <SlimmyJimmy> It estimates > 10 years to crack a 13 character password on my system. Looks like I need to go get a bank loan for one of those fancy NVidia GPUs with more CU's on it than I have.
[05:08:54] <SlimmyJimmy> I'll take out a 30-year mortage to get one.

[05:27:26] <Klotz> I dealt with truecrypt only once, as part of a ctf. I think the "hash" is actually just the initial byte sequence of the volume in question
[05:27:55] <SlimmyJimmy> That seems fairly straight forward

[05:28:50] <Klotz> Looka here, there's even a hashcat article on it
[05:30:22] <SlimmyJimmy> Nice, it doesn't talk about keyfiles. I imagine without a key file you have no prayer of getting the original password/phrase.
[05:32:13] <Klotz> Yeah, regarding those, you'll have to look at the specs for the truecrypt header
[05:32:21] <Klotz> https://www.truecrypt71a.com/documentation/technical-details/truecrypt-volume-format-specification/
[05:33:47] <SlimmyJimmy> That looks interesting, so that was my question earlier, looking at the header you can tell whether a key file was used maybe? If so, that would be tons helpful to me. Sometimes I did, sometimes I didn't.
[05:34:02] <Klotz> (Truecrypt encrypts the header with the secret key and embeds it on the volume. This encrypted header is what you're brute forcing in a potential attack)

[15:45:34] <Klotz> SlimmyJimmy: which cl devices does hashcat use when you run  it? 
[15:46:27] <SlimmyJimmy> I'm not entirely sure what a cl device is but if that's the iGPU, that would be my Radeon 4500U Graphics with 6 Compute Units.
[15:47:26] <Klotz> SlimmyJimmy: in any case, you do realize that once a cl device is "occupied" you likely won't be able to use it for something else, including a second kind of brute force attack
[15:48:06] <SlimmyJimmy> Klotz No, I didn't know that. But it looks like that is the case. It would be nice to start 2 different attacks in 2 different processes.
[15:48:26] <wasamasa> just load up several hashes in one session
[15:48:29] <Klotz> i.e. you can't run two different hashcat commands, both of them initializing different command queues on the same opencl device, and expect it to work
[15:48:41] <Klotz> SlimmyJimmy: what wasamasa said
[15:48:55] <Klotz> why do you need to invoke hashcat two times anyway?

[15:49:41] <SlimmyJimmy> Yes, but I already have the 1 attack going after KeePass and it's going to take > 10 years. The second attack is on a TrueCrypt container where I already know the password. I want to give it a ruleset and see how fast it finds it.
[15:50:03] <wasamasa> lol

[15:51:39] <SlimmyJimmy> The GPU usage doesn't go over 1% and the CPU doesn't seem to go over about 10%
[15:51:49] <SlimmyJimmy> I wonder if I'm fully utilizing my iGPU.
[15:52:13] <Klotz> The cpu may count as an opencl device as well. Pay attention to hashcat's output during initialization or use the option to list the detected opencl devices.
[15:52:16] <SlimmyJimmy> If at al
[15:52:29] <Klotz> that said, brute forcing on a cpu isn't viable in most cases

[15:52:52] <SlimmyJimmy> I like that second option, I need to see what I have here in my arsenal of tools.
[15:54:06] <Klotz> also, you're gonna have trouble running two different hashcat instances if one of them also occupies the cpu, since the other one will still require cpu time to manage the command queue (the logic that pushes password candidates to the graphics card)
[15:54:34] <Klotz> so all in all running two hashcat instances probably isn't a good idea

[15:56:03] <SlimmyJimmy> 6 pitiful CUs compared to some graphics cards with 2048. I could get that 10 years down to 1 maybe. :)
[15:56:32] <euouae> 10 years might be an underestimate
[15:56:49] <SlimmyJimmy> True, it does says > 10 years
[15:57:24] <SlimmyJimmy> I could get an idea when it gets to 1% but it's even to 1% of 1% yet.
[15:57:25] <euouae> encryption is not supposed to be breakable
[15:57:59] <SlimmyJimmy> This is good stuff, that's for sure. this is for honest people who have an idea of what their password might be I think.
[15:58:18] <SlimmyJimmy> That's the cool part.
[16:00:02] <euouae> yeah crypto is cool
[16:00:02] <Klotz> i guess brute forcing your own memory for the exact password is more likely to result in success
[16:00:05] <euouae> are you interested?
[16:00:34] <SlimmyJimmy> me?
[16:00:46] <euouae> yah
[16:01:14] <SlimmyJimmy> Sure but it sounds like if the passwords in memory you would have already known what it was. I'm past that point for truecrypt containers.
[16:02:02] <SlimmyJimmy> If it's in my system memory I probably entered it in myself recently.
[16:02:19] <euouae> lol

[16:03:27] <SlimmyJimmy> "Ed, I'm not your ordinary everyday fool. Where's my old car?"
[16:05:01] <Klotz> SlimmyJimmy: i meant your memory as in what is stored in your head
[16:06:29] <SlimmyJimmy> Klotz Oh, yeah the problem there is I pick the whackiest most bizarre passwords over several years. There's no way for me to brute-force my own memory I don't think without lots of luck.
[16:06:53] <Klotz> Since you're looking at 10+ years trying to remember the password will probably be easier
[16:06:54] <SlimmyJimmy> But that's what's good about hashcat, I can try lots of stuff, what I can remember.
[16:07:12] <Klotz> lol ok
[16:07:37] <SlimmyJimmy> Klotz maybe, but that's why I mentioned how low key this hashcat seems to be working. If it has virtually no impact on my computer experience then why not let is run for years?
[16:07:42] <SlimmyJimmy> is=it
[16:08:03] <SlimmyJimmy> I mean there's always several services running in the background on Windows operating systems...anyway.
[16:08:19] <Klotz> there will be lots of wear and tear on the machine
[16:08:25] <SlimmyJimmy> So I wake up one day on my computer in 5 years and see that it's finally found the password.
[16:08:28] <Klotz> not to mention the electricity bill
[16:08:35] <Klotz> is it really worth it?
[16:08:52] <SlimmyJimmy> Come on man, Windows 10 operating systems runs services in the background all night and day.
[16:09:01] <SlimmyJimmy> It's just another process on the machine.
[16:09:12] <SlimmyJimmy> Unless it keeps it from going into some low-power state.
[16:09:34] <SlimmyJimmy> I'm not sure about that yet but if it only runs when I'm on it like all other services, its no big deal.
[16:09:44] <Klotz> true, but brute force puts a heavy toll on the system. You think an online server can run at full load 24/7 without giving out after some time?
[16:10:13] <SlimmyJimmy> But that's what I'm saying, I'm not running at full load, I checked the Task manager and Resource Monitor, they are very low.
[16:10:28] <wasamasa> what about GPU usage?
[16:10:31] <Klotz> ask crypto miners about the maintenance of their rigs...
[16:10:34] <SlimmyJimmy> Like not even hardly being used at all, that's probably some smart thinking on the developers of the hashcat.
[16:10:50] <SlimmyJimmy> I'm not doing crypto crapola here, I'm doing it low-key because it's no big deal to me.
[16:11:00] <Klotz> SlimmyJimmy: yeah the gpu load is what you should look at
[16:11:08] <SlimmyJimmy> hashcat probably has options to use more/less resources.
[16:11:25] <SlimmyJimmy> I told you earlier, did you not see the post? GPU never goes above 1%
[16:11:53] <Klotz> hm that's suspicious
[16:11:55] <SlimmyJimmy> I wonder if hashcat is even using my GPU. I'll bet it's using the CPU
[16:12:06] <SlimmyJimmy> Because I dont have proper drivers or something.
[16:12:28] <SlimmyJimmy> But it did acknowledge the Radeon Graphics at the beginning so....it should be aware of it.
[16:12:41] <Klotz> upon initialization, the tool should say something like "using cl device..."
[16:12:48] <Klotz> got anything like that?
[16:13:49] <SlimmyJimmy> I printed that earlier. It doesn't say using it just shows devices.

[17:38:25] <TimMc> Seems like throwing out the baby with the bathwater.
[17:38:59] <maroon> older ciphers often had their blocksize being the concatenation of 2 32-bit variables

[19:32:28] <wasamasa> but it would be really silly if the only reason hashcat fails is because someone didn't feel like invoking dd once per container

[19:34:12] <wasamasa> looking at https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/master/src/modules/module_06213.c it supports both hex hashes and reading in the raw 512 bytes from whatever you pass to it
[19:34:27] <wasamasa> be it a truncated file or a container

[21:54:54] <neiluj> Hi! How do you measure the execution time of a function call in PARI/GP? I tried %# and this returns a vector of ints CPU+real time according to the docs, but is the unit nanoseconds?
