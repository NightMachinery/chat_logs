[02:58:57] <jcowan> I think it is unlikely to fly as an R7RS feature, because a lot of Schemers consider CL-loop to be too hairy to tolerate.  But that does not mean it isn't good to *have*.
[02:59:36] <moon-child> :/
[03:01:34] <jcowan> I note there are some .lisp files in src; are they unconverted as yet, or just leftover cruft?

[03:07:52] <jcowan> and I see there are a lot of defgenerics, but no defmethods except in CL code.
[03:13:18] <moon-child> oh, define-macro is still nonstandard?  Huh
[03:13:35] <moon-child> generics--I did just single dispatch, so the methods are part of the class definition

[03:16:56] <jcowan> Okay, so you are only dispatching on accessors/mutators?
[03:17:56] <jcowan> define-macro has never been standardized and IMO never will be, because even though Scheme has hygiene-breaking macros, there are no macro definitions that break hygiene by default.
[03:18:13] <jcowan> (In any case, hygiene-bending a la syntax-parameterize is better.)
[03:18:49] <jcowan> https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/stxparam.html
[03:18:54] <moon-child> no, regular methods too.  E.G. https://github.com/moon-chilled/loop/blob/master/src/do-clause.scm#L12: body is a slot, and accumulation-variables and body-form are methods

[03:35:31] <jcowan> Body is a slot,  I see that.  But what is (accumulation-variables (clause) '()) doing in defclass?  CLHS does not give any way of defining generic functions other than slot-readers and slot-writers AFAICT.
[03:35:59] <moon-child> yes; that's not clos, that's an ad-hoc object system I made for this library

[09:06:32] <contrapunctus> One of my cousins (who's just finished school) wants to get into game dev and asked me to teach him the basics of programming. I thought of SICP or HtDP first, but something oriented around a simple project, especially a game, might be more enjoyable for him. I'd like for him to start with a Lisp dialect, preferably oriented around interactive development (no edit-compile cycle). Any suggestions about 
[09:06:32] <contrapunctus> any aspect of this situation? Dialect, editor, project, book, library, ...?
[09:07:45] <moon-child> perhaps not helpful, but: I have heard both good and bad things about land of lisp
[09:07:50] <contrapunctus> (NB I'm just a hobbyist programmer - some Scheme scripts, some Emacs packages, and some fiddling with Common Lisp is about all I've done.)
[09:08:47] <edgar-rft> Land of Lisp is full of games but beach says it's not very goog in explaining Lisp.

[09:17:13] <contrapunctus> ..it recommends CLISP? ._.
[09:17:21] * imuo is happy to still have a physical copy!
[09:17:32] <imuo> because of that book, i started with clisp
[09:17:50] <imuo> now i use CCL because of multi-thread ARM support
[09:18:13] <imuo> the images in that book are great. that evolution image was really helpful for me when i was studying PL history
[09:18:27] <imuo> i personally like that book.
[09:18:40] <imuo> i would say, start with that.. and then upgrade to that metabook
[09:18:57] <imuo> those 2 combined is all you need (and maybe that graham fellows books:P)

[09:20:50] <imuo> ^best lisp book (imo)
[09:22:38] <dash[m]> it's nice but Lisp in Small Pieces changed my life
[09:22:50] <imuo> contrapunctus: when it comes to games, there is so much involved that i think it makes sense to start looking at libraries
[09:23:11] <dash[m]> yeah, programming is usually the smallest part of games
[09:23:46] <imuo> makign a physics engine can be fun, but also tedious and in the end, can you do better than someone who has thought the maths out over years
[09:24:22] <imuo> beyond that, i think the graphical display is the key thing about most games... so i would focus on findign a good graphical library you like
[09:24:46] <imuo> a couple of years ago, i starting using someone in heres gfx lib.. but i forget at the moment what it was
[09:25:01] <imuo> i just about finally got it working too (on ARM) right before my computer failed to boot
[09:25:26] <imuo> dash[m]: is that one of paul's books?
[09:25:40] <dash[m]> no, Queinnec
[09:25:50] <imuo> ah
[09:26:31] <imuo> for me, lisp is just so intuitive and easy... i think in lisp.. so like, after learning a few basics, i realized that ireally didn't need to learn much more other than specifics :P
[09:27:07] <imuo> at that point, things like Metaobject Protocol vastly gripped my interest becasue it showed me the power of using lists for objects
[09:27:24] <dash[m]> using lists for objects isn't all that interesting
[09:27:39] <dash[m]> using vectors or hashtables for objects is just fine
[09:27:40] <imuo> and how to use higherorder functions to allow for inheritance of faculties
[09:27:49] <imuo> which allow for things like mixins
[09:28:00] <imuo> which i don't know of another language i have perosnally used that allows for mixins
[09:28:26] <dash[m]> pretty much any language with multiple inheritance does
[09:28:28] <dash[m]> python etc
[09:28:35] <imuo> 
[09:28:35] <imuo> 
[09:28:38] <imuo> ah. aye.
[09:28:52] <edgar-rft> I think AMOP (The_Art_of_Metaobject_Protocol) is a bit hard as a beginner book.
[09:28:55] <imuo> i never really dove in to python. i just personally couldn't handle the lack of punctuation
[09:29:06] <dash[m]> everything is an acquired taste
[09:29:08] <imuo> edgar-rft: it is hard in the right way, imo.
[09:29:25] <imuo> as it forces you to think in s-expressions
[09:29:38] <imuo> and defining everything that way, helps me formulate how to lisp in the first place
[09:29:40] *** Joins: oxum (~oxum@106.203.217.191)
[09:29:56] <imuo> surely it is. and i never ate enough python to acquire its tste.
[09:29:57] *** Joins: pjb (~pjb@user/pjb)
[09:30:13] <dash[m]> you can get a lot of mileage out of lisp without ever going near clos though
[09:30:17] <imuo> when i first read about it, i started getting excited about its features... and then i found other languages that had similiar features (but also had punctuation)
[09:30:36] <edgar-rft> imuo: AMOP is definitely a very good book, but I don't think that I would have understood what it is talking about if I had read it as my very first book.
[09:30:37] <contrapunctus> Oh, this looks good. (first game in Land of Lisp .o(why are there /two/ Lisp books with the initials "LoL"? :\))
[09:30:43] <imuo> sure sure you can... however, CLOS to me the the pinnacle of Lisp
[09:31:06] <imuo> how it so elegantly handles object s to me is great
[09:31:22] <imuo>  and again, i personaly think in this manner. i objectify everything i nmy programming.
[09:31:40] *** Quits: oxum (~oxum@106.203.217.191) (Remote host closed the connection)
[09:31:40] <dash[m]> objects were an interesting experiment but it's hard to imagine them having a future
[09:31:48] <dash[m]> outside of a few specialized niches
[09:31:57] <imuo> edgar-rft: very veyr good point
[09:32:13] <imuo> i guess, for me, in college i had a Lisp course. 
[09:32:27] <imuo> in the end we had to write a basic lisp 1.5 interpreter
[09:32:52] <imuo> after understandign the basics of cons cells and s-expressions
[09:32:59] <imuo> and all the basic functions of lisp 1.5
[09:33:07] <imuo> at that point, i would suggest AMOP
[09:33:34] <imuo> dash[m]: i think i understand where you come from and what you say
[09:33:41] <imuo> however, i cannot help but always objectifying things
[09:33:52] <imuo> as again, lisp expressions and objects are literally how i think in real life
[09:34:23] <imuo> as soon as i learned about Objects... i was hooked as it simplifed all of my programmign and understanding (it is very well tailor to beign modular which is PRIME for programing)

[09:35:54] <dash[m]> people like what they're used to
[09:36:40] <edgar-rft> nobody likes being dumb :-)
[09:36:58] <imuo> on the contrary, i am used to Java, i don't like it;)
[09:37:32] <pjb> in all languages, expressions are between parentheses.  Other stuff use [] {} or <>.
[09:37:34] <imuo> OK, all that aside... i am curious how others (if there are any others) go about using Hunchentoot
[09:37:39] <pjb> But in lisp there are only expressions.
[09:37:44] <pjb> It's a simplier language.
[09:38:22] <pjb> imuo: you're already used to ()! Just forget about the (useless) rest.
[09:38:55] <imuo> pjb: after all these years, i still cannot help but read your name as PBJ
[09:39:04] <edgar-rft> pjb: is (useless) a Lisp expression?
[09:39:11] <imuo> probalby because that tag was graffiti all over the city i went to college
[09:39:32] <imuo> "pbj" is graffiti'd on every wall in Columbus, Ohio... :P
[09:39:48] <imuo> (:D)
[09:40:13] <edgar-rft> then tell them that it's spelled pjb correctly :-)
[09:40:31] <imuo> :)
[09:40:46] <imuo> i've never actually seen the person that tags it (but i actually think it is a group)
[09:41:34] <imuo> yeah, never researched.. a quick google shows it is a crew
[09:41:38] <edgar-rft> you could grab yourself a spray can and correct all of them :-)
[09:41:44] <imuo> oh.. hmmm.
[09:41:48] <imuo> that ouwld take a very long time
[09:41:55] <imuo> i was in Columbus for 4 years going to school
[09:42:06] <imuo> over that time, i probably saw 1000? pbj tags?
[09:42:18] <imuo> it was the most common tag in the city
[09:42:34] <flatwhatson> peanut-butter and jelly gang
[09:42:40] <edgar-rft> pbj seems to have a lot of time
[09:43:40] <pjb> If I was president, I'd have any graffiti author be hung high and short.
[09:45:12] * edgar-rft nominates pjb for president in TakaTuka land
[09:46:15] <pjb> :-)
[09:47:20] <imuo> ha.
[09:47:51] <imuo> i personally very much appreciate graffiti. i would enjoy more cities to employ such artists to paint more walls with murals
[09:48:00] <imuo> to each their gnome
[09:48:22] <imuo> now, with hunchentoot... currently becasue is till don't quite get what is proper method of unloading or relaoding things
[09:48:49] <imuo> when i update a page, i currently crash my whole site (by killing the interpreter)
[09:49:02] <imuo> and just restart interpreter loading hte file in again

[18:55:19] <ano> is stumpwm really so broken/abandoned, project looks sort of active on github but latest version in gentoo tree 3 years old and live ebuild broken in a "nobody cares way" (access nonexistent file in $FILESDIR), does it have some fundamental flaw or (gentoo-)lisp sort of abandoned?
[18:57:22] *** Joins: cmsimon (cmsimon@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/cmsimon)
[18:57:32] <MichaelRaskin> My default assumption would be «whoever cared just uses Quicklisp for getting StumpWM nowadays»
[18:57:38] <wasamasa> yup
[18:57:51] <wasamasa> I once made a really shitty PKGBUILD for stumpwm with that approach
[18:58:07] <MichaelRaskin> (And this is my default assumption as StumpWM user and StumpWM package maintainer in Nixpkgs)
[18:58:47] <MichaelRaskin> (… which is an auto-translation from Quicklisp with minor overrides)
[18:58:48] <wasamasa> it won't work unless all dependencies have been installed via quicklisp

[19:03:30] <ano> if quicklisp is sort of modern way to manage lisp libs/pkgs, then seems gentoo-lisp abandoned while there is even no quicklisp ebuild in tree
[19:03:57] <wasamasa> as for whether it's abandoned, well...
[19:04:05] <wasamasa> there are several factors coming into play here
[19:04:45] <wasamasa> way less lisp hackers, many feeling like doing their own thing and X11 window managers requiring a particularly high pain tolerance
[19:04:52] <wasamasa> I can't blame anyone for just using i3 instead
[19:05:54] <wasamasa> on the upside, lisp code doesn't rot nearly as quickly as JS
[19:06:11] <wasamasa> and most of the codebases are tractable
[19:09:34] <jcowan> Indeed, some Lisp code from 1958 still works (with minimal shims) as either CL or Scheme

[20:53:04] <SAL9000> Is there a mechanism in the CL pretty-printer infrastructure for generating "underlined" text like compiler messages?
[20:53:05] <SAL9000> i.e. 
[20:53:10] <SAL9000> "you screwed up ^^^ here"
[20:53:39] <SAL9000> I don't think there is such a feature but maybe I missed something :-)
[20:54:09] <White_Flame> that's part of SLIME, not the CL printer, in terms of the implemented highlights
[20:54:29] <SAL9000> to be clear I don't mean "clickable" text in Emacs
[20:54:37] <SAL9000> I mean things like what modern clang/gcc does
[20:54:58] <White_Flame> also I don't think it could be part of the printer
[20:55:05] <SAL9000> a line from your source file, followed by a line with some "~" or "^" characters indicating the part that is broken in the line above
[20:55:30] <White_Flame> because to highlight a specific object, say the number 100 in the source is out of range, there's no way to specify the specific instance of the number 100 by identity, to trigger the printer to highlight it
[20:55:43] <White_Flame> it'd have to be a richer AST format that you're printing
[20:56:05] <White_Flame> (although I guess a visitor sort of pattern could track the sexpr path you're in etc etc)
[20:57:03] <SAL9000> Sure. In this case, I'm trying to borrow the CL pretty-printer concepts in a non-CL project, where the AST is rich enough to do that.
[20:57:47] *** Quits: ukari (~ukari@user/ukari) (Remote host closed the connection)
[20:58:01] <SAL9000> Most of the AST nodes have source locations to the character, but not all -- so I thought about, instead of printing the original source line, I could dump the AST in a source-like format & point things out that way.
[20:58:47] *** Joins: ukari (~ukari@user/ukari)
[20:58:53] <SAL9000> However, if e.g. the token being highlighted is preceded by linear newlines, I don't know the column number of the token until it's actually rendered -- at which point it's too late to insert the extra line containing "^^^"
[21:00:55] <White_Flame> the printer just needs to know what column it's in, and trigger storing that column when the noted AST node is being printed
[21:01:11] <White_Flame> not sure that involves anything specifically unique to the CL pretty printer
[21:01:25] <White_Flame> well, both left & right column I guess
[21:01:41] <White_Flame> so that smells like a visitor that can scope in & scope out of when that AST node is being printed
[21:01:52] <SAL9000> As far as I can tell, I'd have to extend the pretty printer to do the "^^^" during rendering, since the token may be followed by more newlines, at which point it's too late to emit ^^^
[21:02:40] <SAL9000> Simple example: "foo, bar, baz" where "bar" is to be highlighted & the list items are separated by linear newlines. Imagine that each item is large enough to trip wrapping, so the linear newlines are active.
[21:02:40] <White_Flame> yeah, you tend to abort printing quickly to only show some context before & after the error you're pointing out
[21:02:48] *** Joins: ebzzry (~ebzzry@103.125.151.98)
[21:03:19] <SAL9000> "foo,\nbar,\nbaz" -> "foo,\nbar,\n^^^\nbaz" is the desired result
[21:04:09] <White_Flame> so yeah, track start & end column.  at end of line, if those are set, then print a caret line, clear those flags, and continue
[21:04:22] <SAL9000> yeah, something like that.
[21:04:30] <SAL9000> I also thought about a more general "annotation" mechanism
[21:04:35] <SAL9000> "emit this on the line below me"
[21:04:43] <dash[m]> SAL9000: this was a good paper on this topic, fwiw https://www.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/hirschfeld/publications/media/WeiherHirschfeld_2019_StandardObjectOutStreamingObjectsWithPolymorphicWriteStreams_AcmDL_Preprint.pdf
[21:06:17] <SAL9000> dash[m]: interesting
[21:07:13] <dash[m]> though that's a little more about being able to have richer rendering (like adding clickable links, etc)
[21:07:40] <dash[m]> last time i did this I put source span info in every ast node
[21:07:58] <White_Flame> of course, this is output printing span info, nto input text span info
[21:08:37] <SAL9000> sure. I *could* fix the parser to generate good input text span info, but I thought printing AST instead might be less painful :)

[22:16:37] <aeth> fandom is the worst wiki site
[22:16:59] <aeth> worst part is that if there's a fandom and an official (or at least preferred) wiki, the fandom will probably out-SEO the official/preferred wiki
[22:19:10] <wasamasa> but it's interesting, funny if that's how elisp evolved
[22:19:17] <wasamasa> instead of growing CL features poorly
[22:19:41] <aeth> e.g. Doom Fandom (4,030 articles; that awful Fandom wiki software) outranks Doom Wiki (12,760 articles; appears to be vanilla, usable MediaWiki) if you search for "Doom Wiki" on both Google and DDG. Ofc, it's worse for games than for serious things that you don't even expect to have a "Fandom"
[22:20:04] <aeth> but I wouldn't be surprised if e.g. a crappy Common Lisp Fandom would outrank Cliki in search results
