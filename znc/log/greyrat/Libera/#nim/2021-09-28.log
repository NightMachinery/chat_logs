Being the file lang it is, the only thing I miss is elaborate IDEs like intelij. What's the current path to such a direction currently? Is it nimlsp or did I miss something new? And if yes, how is this going?
[04:51:46] <FromDiscord> <sealmove> fine
[04:52:35] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Jetbrains has their own extension that isnt presently open source, best GUI editor experience is still in vscode

[04:54:09] <FromDiscord> <sealmove> I don't care about intelij specifically, it was just an example. I mean similar features.
[04:54:45] <FromDiscord> <Rika> In reply to @‡∏£—î‡∏Ñ…≠‡πì‡πè◊©—î "I don't care about": Like which?
[04:56:36] <FromDiscord> <sealmove> Stuff like autocompletion and source code generation/alteration

[04:58:32] <FromDiscord> <sealmove> Yes
[04:58:43] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Editors support those
[05:00:25] <FromDiscord> <Rika> It‚Äôs not really the job of nim suggest
[05:01:23] <FromDiscord> <sealmove> I suppose all these things are possible and already exist one way or another, but it's only when they are very well-worked and automatically in place, when they trully give you a different experience. For example when installing vscode's plugin, you get a nice lightweight editor experience. But when you write Scala in the intelij IDE it's a whole different level of experience.
[05:01:24] <FromDiscord> <gnu+linux user> what does {.varargs.} do?
[05:02:08] <FromDiscord> <sealmove> So I wonder if there is a focused effort towards achieving such an experience.
[05:02:39] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> `{.varargs.}` is for C varargs

[23:50:40] <Guest55> Hello everyone. I am an ABSOLUTE newbie to nim.
[23:51:00] <nrds> <06Prestige99> Hello
[23:51:08] <Guest55> I have a question about the "+". I just find that "i=i+1" could not be compiled.
[23:51:15] <Guest55> i+=1 works well.
[23:51:48] <Guest55> Is that build in feature of the nim? I used the i=i+1 for many years and did not feel good for i+=1
[23:52:03] <nrds> <06Prestige99> !eval var i = 0; i = i + 1; echo i
[23:52:05] <NimBot> 1
[23:52:06] <nrds> <12R2D299> 1
[23:53:18] <Guest55> it woks now for some reason.
[23:53:58] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> it should be noted that nim generally uses `inc i` and `dec i` instead of `+=` or `+`
[23:54:00] <nrds> <06Prestige99> maybe you were using let instead of var before?
[23:55:06] <Guest55> I did not. However, I could repeat the issue. As I remembered, it told me something like the "counter" is treated as a function.
[23:55:21] <nrds> <06Prestige99> Hmm
[23:55:21] <Guest55> The "counter" is the variable name.
[23:55:50] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> I think you can get this using `counter 1`, but
[23:55:51] <Guest55> I like the "i=i+1" because the statement works for any langauges.
[23:56:03] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> wh
[23:56:11] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> !eval var i = 0; i = i +1
[23:56:14] <NimBot> Compile failed: /usercode/in.nim(1, 18) Error: attempting to call routine: 'i'
[23:56:27] <Guest55> Exactly! NimBot!
[23:56:29] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> here you go
[23:56:53] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> `+1` is an integer literal, and nim allows to omit parens around function call
[23:56:59] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> so it effectively tried to do like `echo +1`
[23:57:03] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> But with `i`
[23:57:22] <nrds> <06Prestige99> interesting
[23:57:30] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/7053
[23:59:39] <Guest55> So it is not encouraged to add space before the "+"
