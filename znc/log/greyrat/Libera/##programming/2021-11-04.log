[00:28:49] <[itchyjunk]> fig, ax = plt.subplots()  # Create a figure containing a single axes.
[00:29:10] <[itchyjunk]> does plt stand for an object with subplots being a method?
[00:29:18] <[itchyjunk]> or does my java intuition not carry over?
[00:30:54] <LiaoTao> It probably is an object, yes
[00:31:04] <adder``> I think no; even if you work for Lockheed Martin writing software for fighter jets, it's the pilot that (ab)uses it, nothing to do with you
[00:31:08] <LiaoTao> Though it could be a namespace, I guess. Python uses . for both

[00:33:04] <[itchyjunk]> so `fig` is an object and `ax` is also an object?

[00:33:35] <dodo> [itchyjunk]: they are something that's returned, so, most likely objects

[00:34:18] <[itchyjunk]> isn't everything in py an object, btw? unlike java that has primitives
[00:34:19] <dodo> fig
[00:34:24] <dodo> well, internally
[00:34:55] <[itchyjunk]> so how can fig, an object, contain one or more axis (another object) ? :s
[00:35:02] <apotheon> No, not everything is an object, in the linguage semantics, unless I missed something so well hidden it's effectively irrelevant.
[00:35:04] <[itchyjunk]> i don't think i've come across this type of concept before
[00:35:05] <dodo> dunno
[00:35:06] <apotheon> (in Python)
[00:35:14] <dodo> i guess #python would know about mathplotlib
[00:35:47] <dodo> [itchyjunk]: oh you can just stuff objects into other ones, no problem there
[00:35:49] <[itchyjunk]> if i ask these basic question there, someone is bound to tell me to go read a book and i'll give and and never learn anything :s
[00:35:58] <dodo> or in lists, and put that list in another object
[00:36:02] <dodo> lol
[00:36:08] <[itchyjunk]> oh right
[00:36:17] <[itchyjunk]> putting objects inside list, that i am fimiliar with
[00:36:25] <[itchyjunk]> give up*
[00:36:29] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: in python everything you can give a name to is an object
[00:36:42] <[itchyjunk]> ah! i knew it!
[00:36:51] <deniska> `a = 5`, 5 is an object
[00:36:58] <[itchyjunk]> so fig and ax are both objects. somehow a function is returning 2 objects?
[00:37:04] <dodo> sure
[00:37:07] <apotheon> That's not the same as "everything is an object", but yeah, I think that's correct about everything to which you can give a name.
[00:37:08] <dodo> return foo, bar
[00:37:18] <[itchyjunk]> oh maybe it's returning at array of objects?
[00:37:21] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: technically a function in python can only return a single object
[00:37:26] <[itchyjunk]> oh it can straight up return multiple objects?
[00:37:29] <[itchyjunk]> ah
[00:37:31] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: and in this case an object it returns is a tuple of 2 elements
[00:37:41] <[itchyjunk]> so it's returning a single object containing 2 object
[00:37:49] <apotheon> yes
[00:38:08] <[itchyjunk]> and the a,b = [c,d] is sugar notation for a = something[0], b = something[1] or somesuch
[00:38:10] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: and `a, b = something` is kinda like writing `a = something[0]; b = something[1]
[00:38:22] <[itchyjunk]> great! makes sense
[00:38:32] <bomb> Java also has that now
[00:38:36] <deniska> (it does a bit more than that, like it will produce an error if something contains more than 2 elements)
[00:38:50] <[itchyjunk]> oh java can do a,b = array and it works?
[00:38:51] <Linkandzelda> [itchyjunk]: that piece of code is returning a tuple and assigning both parts to 2 variables I think 
[00:38:52] <bomb> you can return a `record` of multiple stuff
[00:38:53] <[itchyjunk]> i didn't know that
[00:39:11] <[itchyjunk]> ahh makes sense
[00:39:17] <apotheon> I think that's new in Java.
[00:39:32] <apotheon> . . . which might be why you didn't know.
[00:39:33] <Linkandzelda> Tuple looks look this: (1, 2), but it's not a list
[00:40:17] <dodo> or like this: 1, 2
[00:40:21] <bomb> yeah, records are Java 16 thing, released few months ago
[00:40:27] <Linkandzelda> You can have a list of tuples: [(1, 2), (11, 22)] 
[00:40:50] <dodo> which can be annoying, "return 1," returns a tuple..

[01:14:36] <flakland> fun trivia: it was retitled "Alternate Title" after the record company (RCA) complained that the original title was actually somewhat "taboo to the British audience".

[01:38:42] <flakland> are they not NULL/uninitialized at program entry point?

[01:39:57] <flakland> ELF entry point, before initialization of libc/etc occurs
[01:40:10] <DPA> No, they point to other parts of the data structure. They form a graph of sorts.

[01:41:14] <flakland> there are ways to do this using a base address, and instead of pointers using an offset

[02:14:36] <beaky> pyzozord: yes in languages like haskell (which inspired agda) there is a concept of 'referential transparency' where references (i.e. variables and expressions in the language) are directly substitutable with the values they evaluate into and this idea does not hold when working with things like pointers to mutable state where each pointer can bear the same value but because they're different
[02:14:38] <beaky> pointers they're not 'identical' which is why i cant do things like simply 'get the address of' the circular linked list node to compare it to its left and right pointers

[02:41:14] <beaky> you can have pointers but then it wont really be codata i think
[02:41:23] <InPhase> Oh, well that sounds unpleasant.
[02:41:26] <beaky> so also cheating
[02:41:48] <pyzozord> if you don't use pointers then your actual data is not circular
[02:42:16] <pyzozord> then you only make it appear circular inside your linked list api functions somehow, like with that corecursion and codata
[02:42:46] <beaky> but with referential transparency the expressions and values themselves are circular (no "pointer to" business)
[02:42:49] <pyzozord> but that stuff must be aware that data is not actually circular and it must fake the circularity by wrapping around and starting to return the same things at some point
[02:43:57] <pyzozord> if your pointers point to immutable memory then it has referential transparency imo
[02:44:26] <beaky> true
[02:44:55] <beaky> but its cheating i must solve this the hardcore way without reaching for memory or monads 
[02:45:00] <pyzozord> anyway when your corecursion fakes the circularity it can also throw exception StopIteration or something like that
[02:46:04] <beaky> ok maybe counting is not cheating because i can count the tree that i build the circular linked list from
[02:46:37] <beaky> i forgot about the tree lol
[02:46:53] <pyzozord> if you don't use pointers, your actual data is not circular, then you can only make it appear circulra by faking it, then something that fakes it must be aware when it repeats and then it can signal somehow that it just made a full circle

[03:09:39] <Inst> model 1: machine code gets sent to OS, OS filters it for hardware, hardware executes
[03:10:11] <Inst> model 2: bytecode gets sent to interpreter, interpreter converts it to machine code, machine code gets sent to OS, OS filters it for hardware, hardware executes
[03:11:12] <bomb> machine code -> CPU, then calls are made to OS
[03:11:13] <Twix> machine code gets not send to the OS. It gets interpreted by the CPU and from time to time it calls the OS.

[03:30:05] <sonny> especially since you can create your own teaching language if need be
[03:30:18] <nitrix> Actually, TCL would be probably better overall.
[03:30:23] <bomb> Lazarus is problematic on macOS kveroneau 
[03:31:04] <nitrix> No stack manipulations to think about from forth, no choice/backtracking from prolog, and a much simpler homoiconic language than lisp.

[07:24:52] <droid3> I am implementing them as a m dimensional array thats obvious
[07:25:44] <droid3> but what indices in this m-dimensional array corrospond to up or down indices in the tensor representation in math
[07:27:04] <droid3> like T^ikj or T^ik_j or T_ikj all can be represented with T[i][k][j] 
[07:27:08] <yin> droid3: maybe you'll be luckyer in ##math
[07:27:21] <newpy> I'm thinking of picking up a budget laptop for dev work, any recs?
[07:27:35] <droid3> well i ask here because i already know the math this is more a computer implementation thing
[07:28:11] <droid3> Because say you want to perform outer product , inner product , contraction , addition when the order are equal ...etc
[07:29:01] <yin> which language?
[07:29:41] <droid3> the issue is the operations themselve are easy to implement but if there is no way to distinguish between upper contravariant and lower covariant indices for the array then i am stuck
[07:30:24] <droid3> Language i am sticking with is java but in general i have no issue using other language to me most can have the ability to do multidimensional array data types

[07:41:43] <PlanckWalk> If you're dealing with multidimensional arrays representing tensors with c^n entries, then having n boolean variables is trivial
[07:43:18] <PlanckWalk> Or really, one array of booleans
[07:43:58] <PlanckWalk> It's possible to have a convention where all upper indices are before all lower ones, but that may turn out to be limiting later

[12:46:28] <d3x0r> who was that guy that wants infininte stacks?
[12:47:21] <d3x0r> problem with a stack , is that the 'stack' is associated with the execution of the program.. so you only get 1 allocation per function, and anything it made disappears when it left... if you have a function that itself allocates infinite stack and lives forever until it fills and processes said buffer and then returns
[12:47:28] <d3x0r> noone else can even use thta data
[12:47:59] <d3x0r> and you might as well just use a malloc() instead of a static instance and just remember to call free()  I guess cleaning up after yourself is beyond the ability of most coders

[12:52:12] <d3x0r> I can't find anything - but I would really think that accessing the data on the stack would have a faster path to a more dedicated stack state; if you move 'everything!' to the heap you lose some optimization?

[14:23:18] <Guest5778> I finished my bsc in CS and I don't hafe the money to continue for my msc even if the best uni in my country accepted me. I was first at uni each year. Now that I need to work no one want to hire me. So I'm thinking about using all my money to do a bootcamp to be fullstack dev or software engineer. Any though on this idea in my situation ? I'm also thinking about doing it outside of my country to 
[14:23:24] <Guest5778> then find a job to leave France.

[14:29:56] <Guest5778> there is no scolarship
[14:30:40] <Guest5778> mobidrop: yes i finished my bsc i can work but they don't want to hire me, i feel like 100% of offers are for master's degree student 
[14:30:57] <mobidrop> if you can't do it yourself maybe try finding a job via a recruiter
[14:30:59] <d3x0r> so - I have these various problems with implementing physics... 
[14:31:04] <Guest5778> PlanckWalk: I wanted to do the bootcamp outside of my country to then try to move there
[14:31:18] <PlanckWalk> They may want to only hire MSc's, but they won't be able to.
[14:31:28] <PlanckWalk> There just aren't that many MScs.
[14:31:32] <d3x0r> 1) if I do like 1/r^2 acceleration, at a slow speed/time step, at some point a body with be at 1e-10 and get a HUGE accelearation
[14:31:48] <mobidrop> IME there's more jobs for bsc than masters
[14:31:49] <d3x0r> so the next tick it's well beyond the place that would have slowed it down by e100

[14:41:15] <LiaoTao> If you need a work visa, companies probably won't sponsor it unless you do have a Master's degree. If you're coming through the EU then it should be fine.
[14:41:20] <LiaoTao> The pay is pretty shit though.
[14:41:40] <mobidrop> yeah don't expect great pay, work for 2 years then upgrade
[14:41:56] <LiaoTao> Also housing is a major issue.
[14:41:56] <mobidrop> then couple years later your degree won't matter much anymore because now you have experience

[14:43:57] <LiaoTao> Which is a considerable chunk of your salary.
[14:45:09] <bomb> yeah it sounds like the opposite direction of a happy life, but whatever makes you happy :)

[14:46:05] <Guest5778> i don't think so

[14:46:21] <LiaoTao> It's all relative.
[14:46:52] <Rounin> Who don't people just show up for no reason and work for free, like slaves
[14:47:16] <bomb> companies will exploit you regardless. and the govt won't do much about it
[14:47:19] <Guest5778> like for someone like me is there somethin that I can do to make my profile more attractive ?
[14:47:30] <bomb> why don't you consider Germany?
[14:47:47] <bomb> they have rivers and blondies as well, if you're into that
[14:47:49] <Guest5778> bomb: I did, but i'm more into sweden
[14:47:58] <Guest5778> but if the job market is good it's also good for me 
[14:48:20] <Guest5778> bomb: WTF
[14:48:24] <bomb> yeah, significantly better in Germany
[14:48:52] <Guest5778> So should I go in germany and try to apply there
[14:49:03] <Guest5778> or should I stay home and apply from internet ?
[14:49:15] <LiaoTao> C# and various javascript frameworks are hot wherever you go, so that's something to focus on.
[14:49:16] <bomb> that's an option. many companies (esp. startups) are also OK with Skype interviews
[14:49:31] <Rounin> Guest5778: Hmm... If you do apply from home, you could apply both in Germany and Sweden, and indicate that you're willing to move
[14:49:34] <Guest5778> I can also try to do a bootcamp in germany
[14:49:43] <Guest5778> maybe they can help with job placement at the end 
[14:49:44] <Guest5778> no ?
[14:49:46] <Rounin> And of course, you could do Denmark, Norway, I dunno, Belgium, wherever

[14:50:00] <bomb> yeah bootcamps are nice, you get to know people

[14:50:35] <bomb> nope
[14:50:39] <Guest5778> less polution
[14:50:44] <Guest5778> good lanscape
[14:50:48] <Guest5778> a lot of space
[14:51:04] <bomb> Sweden has a considerably high suicide rate
[14:51:13] <Guest5778> i didn't know that
[14:51:38] <edgar-rft> that doesn't sound so good for people who prefer tabs over space
[14:51:41] <Guest5778> so if I want to try a bootcamp in germany, have you advice on which one to choose ?
[14:51:43] <LiaoTao> bomb, That's fair, but I don't think it applies as much for foreigners.
[14:53:06] <Rounin> Sweden has some nice places... Like, Stockholm has that whole tons-of-Islands-and-channels thing going for it... Almost like a Scandinavian Venice

[15:47:59] <mrig> Guest5778 if you have qualifications within the domain, you would most likely find that prospective employers within a country would admire your 'get up and go' if you were to go to that country and get work in a bar or some such, whilst looking for work in your chosen field. It would be a superb talking point in interviews.
[15:49:07] <mrig> Most people love an adventure, and if they can not have them themselves they appreciate the spirit in others, if you are making the effort to learn their native language.
[15:49:37] <mrig> That last point is an important one though, and also embracing their culture.

[20:15:31] <deniska> Guest41: haskell does that via its type system
[20:15:31] <sonny> in this context, pure means a function procedure where "the result is always identical for identical arguments"? then sure
[20:15:59] <Guest41> `int GLOBAL = 0; int add(int x, int y) { int z = GLOBAL + 1; return x + y; }` should be pure too
