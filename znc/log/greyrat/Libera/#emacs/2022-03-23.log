Many machines (such as sparcs) do not have a hardware modulo operation, so they implement it in software. On many sparcs over 50% of the time to intern is spent in the modulo.

[08:58:55] <blinux> gnoo: Yes, I've been using vim.
[08:59:49] <gnoo> i'd still recommend opening regular emacs and reading 'Ctrl-h t' at least once to get a small idea of doing things in emacs
[08:59:58] <gnoo> you'll need it anytime doom breaks
[09:00:44] <blinux> OK, got Doom Emacs to run.
[09:01:36] *** Parts: hwrd (aa272caead@2604:bf00:561:2000::137) (WeeChat 3.4.1)
[09:01:56] <gnoo> after using doom for a while, you should probably use vanilla emacs and then configure evil-mode, that way you'll know what happens and why instead of using whatever doom decides to add
[09:02:02] <Shortstop1> I too would recommend knowing some basic Emacs keybindings. Reason being is that sometimes it all doesn't translate to Vim keybindings by default. Knowing both is actually good
[09:02:05] <blinux> gnoo: I got through several commands in the emacs help. I don't know how much longer the document was.
[09:02:28] <gnoo> read it all, it's boring at the start and slightly better towards the end
[09:02:33] *** Joins: Viking667 (viking@203.184.11.139)
[09:02:48] <Viking667> Hi all, long time no type.
[09:02:55] <Shortstop1> I actually always wanted to convert to a 'Evil Collections' setup though. I just fear that most keybindings aren't accounted for in all modes
[09:02:59] <gnoo> you'll learn to navigate buffers, find how to search for help offline and much more
[09:03:09] <blinux> I'm not sure I can handle both right now. I was thinking I'd just use the Emacs default keybindings, but it seems like there are other benefits to Doom Emacs.
[09:03:28] <gnoo> oh, if you're not commited to vim bindings, you should probably use emacs bindings
[09:03:41] <Viking667> I've got a bash script, how do I generate a TAGS or tags file from within emacs? using either of etags or ctags doesn't seem to have "sh" as one of the supported languages.
[09:03:52] <blinux> I really don't know. I could like emacs bindings better, but I am familiar with vim.
[09:03:58] <gnoo> i use it and it's great. it'll work just about everywhere: in bash(and anything that uses readline), gdb,...
[09:04:35] <blinux> It seems like the bash terminal uses emacs keybindings by default like C-n/p for next/previous command and other applications use that too.
[09:04:47] <gnoo> yes, a lot of programs use emacs bindings
[09:05:20] <Viking667> I use them a lot in bash
[09:05:37] <blinux> I'm set bash to use vim commands though too.
[09:06:07] <gnoo> blinux: this is how i got started with emacs: https://iteroni.com/watch?v=d6iY_1aMzeg
[09:06:17] <Viking667> blinux: I've no idea how that works, is there a distinction between entry and command mode?
[09:06:24] <edrx> Viking667: for what language? I usually do things like "etags *.[chy]"...

[09:07:16] <gnoo> probably not, i don't really know
[09:07:53] <blinux> gnoo: Oh, the Uncle Dave playlist. I have that bookmarked.
[09:08:30] <Shortstop1> The one thing that irked me about Doom is that its just 1 guy's config. While SpaceMacs is a COMMUNITY config. Just keep that in mind. I know Doom is good in terms of optimization but you might have more fun rolling with your own config. I'd check out Uncle Dave's Emacs vids too on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX2044Ew-UVVv31a0-Qn3dA6Sd_-NyA1n
[09:08:34] <Shortstop1> blinux:
[09:08:43] <gnoo> blinux: it'll teach you enough elisp to write your init sometimes. i'd suggest after a while to rewrite your init.el (after reading (info "ielm"))
[09:08:57] <Shortstop1> gnoo: nice dude, me too
[09:09:01] <edrx> gnoo: what is iteroni? and instance of invidious?
[09:09:03] <Shortstop1> Uncle Dave's Emacs videos are the only good ones honestly

[09:15:15] <blinux> gnoo: That could be a big problem if all the documentation keybindings are the default. Though, maybe I won't need those documents if I'm using vim since I know vim, or maybe Doom Emacs re-written the documents with replaced keybindings?

[09:18:06] <edrx> for example, if you run M-x helpful-function find-file it creates a temporary buffer with a ton of information about find-file in a very well-organized format.

[09:18:48] <Viking667> gnoo: hm, so my version (which seems to have been installed when I put etags in place) doesn't know what shell script is, so it doesn't show it in the supported languages.

[11:42:11] <parsnip> somehow i'm imagining this will be better than anyone's examples, or somehow make more sense than just reading the API docs

[21:10:54] <edrx> Fun fact: this movie sparked a huge cultural debate in China because of how accurate to Chinese culture it was. The center of the debate was the perception that Westerners were better at making a movie with accurate Chinese cultural elements than the Chinese themselves.

[21:38:56] <zebrag> I think it is `deft` that is triggering the constant file saving thing.
[21:39:03] <bpalmer> deft?
[21:39:03] <fsbot> deft is an emacs mode for quickly browsing, filtering, and editing directories of plain text notes, inspired by notational velocity -- see http://jblevins.org/projects/deft/
[21:39:59] <bpalmer> ah, right.
[21:40:31] <cvandusen> It does have `deft-auto-save-buffers'.
[21:41:26] <zebrag> bpalmer: it searches all you files for an expression, interactively, and shows all the "title" (generated), and then you can visit the files, and you are already on the relevant line. Very convenient.
