[00:40:50] <Obormot\Gaia> Continuing to read _The King of Elfland's Daughter_:
[00:41:41] <galambo> can I ask you guys for a recommendation for a laptop exclusively for web browsing and lots of typing? x220 vs chromebook?
[00:42:09] <galambo> (or other thinkpad)
[00:42:19] <Obormot\Gaia> So, our protagonist, Alveric, marries the titular king's daughter, and they have a son (Orion). At one point the kid says that he wants to be a hunter when he grows up (of course). Cool, good choice, says Alveric. Then they have this exchange:
[00:43:04] <Obormot\Gaia> "“And some day I will go a long way over the hills and hunt stranger things,” said the boy. “What kind of things,” asked Alveric. But the boy did not know.
[00:43:04] <Obormot\Gaia> His father suggested different kinds of beasts. “No, stranger than them,” said Orion. “Stranger even than bears.”
[00:43:04] <Obormot\Gaia> “But what will they be?” asked his father.” “Magic things,” said the boy.”"
[00:43:30] <Obormot\Gaia> So here we have the hierarchy of beasts: Regular animals (not bears) < bears < magic things
[00:47:00] <Obormot\Gaia> Later, Alveric assembles an adventuring party to travel to Elfland to recover his wife (she's been lured back to her homeland by magic, as one does), and we have this amazing passage:
[00:47:21] <Obormot\Gaia> “And away rode Alveric out of the village of Erl with his company of adventurers behind him; a moonstruck man, a madman, a lovesick lad, a shepherd boy and a poet. And Alveric made Vand, the young shepherd, the master of his encampment, for he deemed him to be the sanest amongst his following; but there were disputes at once as they rode, before they came to make any encampment; and Alveric, hearing or feeling the discontent
[00:47:21] <Obormot\Gaia>  of his men, learned that on such a quest as his it was not the sanest but the maddest that should be given authority. So he named Niv, the witless lad, the master of his encampment; and Niv served him well till a day that was far thence, and the moonstruck man stood by Niv, and all were content to do the bidding of Niv, and all honoured Alveric’s quest. And many men in numerous lands do saner things with less harmony.”
[00:47:55] <Obormot\Gaia> (Clearly, this is the same reasoning followed by CFAR, Leverage, etc.)
[00:48:00] <pompolic> lol
[00:48:11] <pompolic> what's the difference between a moonstruck man and a madman?
[00:48:37] <Obormot\Gaia> Their respective insanity origin stories were explained earlier

[01:59:10] <pompolic> but at the same time, then i don't know what's so upsetting about the content of Vassar's ideas

[02:04:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> pompolic: There's no point in "jailbreaking" the people who can't function as free citizens of a republic (you'll just drive them conventionally crazy, which is not an improvement), and the ones who *can* function as free citizens also *can't* be "jailbroken"
[02:04:25] <saturn2> "most people are insane zombies" is something that's hard not to notice if you actually try to investigate how society works rather than abstractly theorizing about it

The initials stand for Avtomat Nikonova model of 1994, after its chief designer Gennadiy Nikonov, who previously worked on the Nikonov machine gun. …)

His most famous accomplishments were probably as the designer of the AN-94 assault rifle, and the "straight-back bolt." …)
[03:07:21] <quanticle> Oh, the AN-94 is the one that had that really complicated feed mechanism to allow it to fire up to three shots before the shooter felt any recoil, right?
[03:07:25] <gwern> 'The weapon has no bolt, but a stationary breech and movable barrels, each with its own gas cylinders and pistons connected to the adjacent barrel. Upon firing one barrel, the next one is forced backwards, and thus causes the next barrel to move forward. Firing operates a feeding device that channels rounds into the barrels, with the spent cartridges being ejected from both sides. The barrels...
[03:07:31] <gwern> ...move back and forth the full length of the cartridge. The double-barreled design, in combination with the shortest possible stroke, allows for a high rate of fire at more than 3,000 rounds per minute.'

[03:21:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok, but the reason in this case is that Mikhail Kalashnikov was a genius, and created pretty much the best possible design
[03:21:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> You can improve on it for specific or niche uses but making something generally better is extremely difficult
[03:21:58] <gwern> true, but simply gazing in admiration is not a good basis for a career
[03:22:25] <gwern> it must take a certain level of self-delusion to try to design a linux or ak-47 killer (albeit for entirely different reasons)

[03:28:15] <quanticle> Like that 9mm carbine I linked the other day. It gets featured on the front of a gun magazine, but my assumption is that basically no one is going to be spending $3000 on a roller-delayed 9mm carbine. It's on the cover because it's interesting, not because it's practical.
[03:29:18] <mst> or because the manufacturers paid

[06:39:17] <feepbot> <gwern> '. I’m referring to architects when I say that. I think that many students today, in order to be rigorous to the legacy of Le Corbusier, or to be rigorous to algorithmic design philosophies as laid down through a rereading of Gilles Deleuze in the mid-1990s, feel like they have to produce a certain kind of design—but then they go home and play a videogame, or watch a
[06:39:17] <feepbot> movie, or even read a fantasy novel or whatever, and they see these vast tree-cities, or old castles on cliffs, or Japanese pagodas the size of whole planets, or derelict mining spaceships, and they actually like that kind of architecture. But it’s exactly what they do not design in the studio. Of course, part of that is the fact that the physical realization of those sorts of
[06:39:17] <feepbot> ideas very quickly crosses over into kitsch, into the realm of the theme park: that’s Euro Disney or Busch Gardens. Or, for that matter, it’s Dubai...I often wonder: do architects really enjoy these sprawling, biomorphic, 21st-century algorithmic buildings that look like huge webs of kudzu—or would they rather, just for kicks, design Dracula’s castle?

[08:49:09] <rmmh> something like a 1% chance that mars crashes into earth in the next 5 billion years
[08:50:00] <PlanckWalk> Oh, I better put in my calendar for a couple billion years from now "look up and check whether Mars crash is imminent"
[08:50:21] <nshepperd2> that sounds cool
[08:50:27] <rmmh> don't worry, you'll have a few million years of warning
[08:50:51] <quanticle> I say let it happen. The last time a Mars sized rock crashed into Earth, we got a moon out of it.
[08:50:53] <PlanckWalk> (If I'm around in a few billion years, I would expect to be not around Earth anymore though)
[08:51:00] <quanticle> So look at it this way: two moons!
[08:51:00] <rmmh> "We integrated 201 different versions, S(k) {468 (kg[2100, 100]), of S2468, starting at 3.344298 Gyr, each with an offset of 0.15k mm in the semi-major axis of Mars. Within 100 Myr, five cases lead to the ejection of Mars from the Solar System (semi-major axis .100 AU) and the remaining 196 solutions end in collision, with the following distribution: Sun–Mercury, 33; Sun– Mars, 48;
[08:51:02] <rmmh> Mercury–Venus, 43; Mercury–Earth, 1; Mercury–Mars, 1; Venus–Earth, 18; Venus–Mars, 23; Earth–Mars, 29."
[08:51:09] <quanticle> How rad would that be‽
[08:51:28] <rmmh> they're perturbing their model by *millimeters*
[08:51:49] <rmmh> and there's enough chaos in the solar system dynamics for that to lead to collisions
[08:52:00] <quanticle> Yeah, sensitivity to initial conditions is like that.
[08:52:26] <PlanckWalk> Uhh, 100 Myr?
[08:53:48] <rmmh> The most notable solution is S2468, in which a close encounter of Mars with the Earth with a closest approach of only 794 km occurs at 3.3443 Gyr (Fig. 2).
[08:55:02] <rmmh> so they go from this crazy close encounter to what would happen in the next 100 million years
[08:55:25] <quanticle> 3.3443 Gyr? You don't need to worry about that one; the Sun will have gone red giant by then.
[08:56:20] <rmmh> wrong, it's 5 billion years
[08:56:33] <quanticle> Oh.
[08:57:35] <rmmh> but uh, we're fucked long before it becomes a red giant https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future
[08:57:36] <Robomot> Timeline of the far future - Wikipedia (While the future cannot be predicted with certainty, present understanding in various scientific fields allows for the prediction of some far-future events, if only in the broadest outline.[ …)
[08:58:46] <PlanckWalk> Ah yes, I see
[09:02:08] <PlanckWalk> I wonder how likely that particular scenario is compared with, say, a close approach with a star disrupting the orbits?
[09:04:19] <PlanckWalk> Looks like the inner solar system is small enough and stars are sparse enough that disruption by stars isn't very likely.
[09:04:32] <nshepperd2> "110 million 	The Sun's luminosity has increased by 1%." ominous
[09:05:17] <PlanckWalk> Time to put up the sunshades!
[09:05:23] <rmmh> why worry about holocene extinction events when you can worry about the oceans boiling stopping plate tectonics
[09:10:19] <quanticle> 50,000 years from now: "According to Berger and Loutre (2002), the current interglacial period will end, sending the Earth back into a glacial period of the current ice age, regardless of the effects of anthropogenic global warming. According to more recent studies however (2016), the effects of anthropogenic global warming may delay this otherwise expected glacial period by another 50,000
[09:10:21] <quanticle> years, effectively skipping it. The Niagara Falls will have eroded away the remaining 32 km to Lake Erie, and will cease to exist. The many glacial lakes of the Canadian Shield will have been erased by post-glacial rebound and erosion."
[09:10:48] <quanticle> So what I'm getting out of this is that anthropogenic global warming is actually a gift to the far future, allowing them to skip an entire ice age
[09:11:14] <quanticle> Have the EAs heard about this?
[09:11:18] <quanticle> Has anyone told Robin Hanson?

[10:38:46] <nshepperd2> clearly conversation is the only efficient way for Vassar to deliver his special enlightened knowledge, and this is a total coincidence and nothing to do with the fact that it allows him to gish gallop nonsense without anyone having time to notice what's wrong with it

[10:45:47] <quanticle> The VR equivalent of a kickban will be an orbital ion cannon strike that vaporizes the person, and leaves a neat little scorch mark where they were standing
[10:47:28] <SDr> quanticle, vtuber stack is different: in vrchat we animate facial gestures via hand gestures (~6-8 of them; and there's now a facial tracker as well), while vtubers use cameras to do realtime video capture + facial expression read and render it to avi, because: vtubers have their hands full with the thing they're gaming, while in vrchat, _presence_
[10:47:28] <SDr> is the word
[10:48:08] <quanticle> Hmmm... interesting!
[10:48:20] <SDr> and the aesthetics of hololive is "cute girls having cute voices doing cute & funny things while also being covertly lesbians", which is... not yet!.. something I can easily emulate
[10:48:53] <SDr> and also, given the revenue & hits they're getting, I'm strongly, strongly suspecting a mid-to-heavyweight marketing ops underneath those cute little faces :)
[10:48:53] <quanticle> Not all vtubers are HoloLive but, uh... cute girls having cute voices and doing cute & funny things is pretty pervasive, yeah
[10:52:00] <rsaarelm> I guess the market will get pretty cutthroat as more and more people figure out they can do this thing.
[10:52:20] <quanticle> Well, it's weird: I feel like the marketing op is more symbiotic than the normal K-Pop/J-Pop model of finding a cute girl and locking her away in the social equivalent of a pressure cooker until she either turns into a star or crumbles into dust. It seems to me that vtubers are much closer to independent contractors, and they're responsible for growing their own audience and building out their
[10:52:22] <quanticle> own (sub) brand, but the overall HoloLive infrastructure is there to help with things like negotiating streaming rights, getting exclusivity arrangement, setting up anime conference panel appearances, etc.
[10:52:59] <quanticle> Oh, the market will definitely get more cutthroat, but, at the same time, I think that a lot of this is coming at the expense of other forms of media, especially radio.

[10:53:11] <quanticle> Like... who under the age of 60 listens to AM talk radio?
[10:53:23] <rsaarelm> How much is HoloLive still dependent on the people being able to naturally do the voice? Is there good realtime voice changer tech already?
[10:53:42] <SDr> rsaarelm, they all use voicechangers already
[10:53:57] <SDr> rsaarelm, but you have to have A-level voice to start with to compete
[10:54:18] <SDr> (it's superstimuli for a reason :)   )
[10:55:54] <quanticle> Honestly? I kind of want a time machine to teleport me 50 years into the future, so I can go up to some historian and ask them to explain to me the Grand Narrative around the economics and sociology of vtubers
[10:56:15] <quanticle> And I'll be like, "And in exchange for that, I can tell you how your theories are hilariously wrong"
[10:56:17] <rsaarelm> So is the voice changer good enough that Gura could actually be a chain-smoking 47-year old Chinese man?
[10:58:07] <SDr> rsaarelm,  here's ~80 hours of fucking around with (free, and commercial) voicechangers: it can remove some issues; it can make my deep voice to something of a 5 year old, it can't, really, turn it into any acceptable catgirl level :/
[10:59:02] <SDr> (there was a documentary around CIA covert ops' disguise department, and they can work miracles, but even she admited, that the only thing they can't do is turn a man into female :/ )
[10:59:41] <SDr> so, re Gura, prolly not a 47-year-old chinese man, but can be a 25 year old girl

[18:41:10] <kuudes> I mean, if first dose cuts infectivity to about 1/2, and second dose to about 1/4, and third dose from there by 10x to 1/40
[18:41:45] <kuudes> doesn't this mean first dose takes a 1/2 person out of infectable pool, second dose 1/4 persons and third dose 9/40 ~ 1/4 persons out of the pool?
[18:42:31] <kuudes> so first doses are better utilitaristically, but third doses are nearly as good as second doses?

[18:46:38] <PapuaHardyNet> aw, come on, just because you can't afford rent doesn't mean you have to be considered homeless
[18:46:53] <adiabatic> kuudes: rounding error in the total homeless population, I'd bet
[18:47:02] <PapuaHardyNet> well, maybe I and kuudes have an incorrect idea of cali
[18:47:12] <mst> 'homeless' normally means 'no fixed address'

[18:54:24] <kuudes> but instead make some sort of military camp / oil drilling rig gig of some years out of it and plan to emigrate later with money
[18:55:36] <PapuaHardyNet> by emigrate you mean emgirate out of the state, right?

[18:57:40] <mst> kuudes: adiabatic was the one using 'homeless' wrong
[18:58:52] <mst> my point was you were talking about people rent sharing and living in tents, and adiabatic started talking about homeless people and saying they must not have jobs, which is where the conversation started bifurcating

[19:18:39] <ggreer> apparently SF now has a law that all restaurants must check people's vaccination status? wow am I glad I moved. their vaccination rate is like 90%. they've had 3 covid deaths this whole month (647 total in the whole pandemic)
[19:18:45] <kuudes> it's ok, Filipepe
[19:19:01] <kuudes> nice!
[19:20:20] <ggreer> kuudes: it's not nice. it's caused a ton of businesses to die. if your business doesn't check vaccination status 100% of the time, it will be shut down
[19:21:50] <kuudes> isn't it the other way around, with checks they can be openend?
[19:22:55] <ggreer> they used to be open when cases and deaths were much higher
[19:23:53] <kuudes> if about everyone is vaccinated, are the unvaccinated patrons that big of a loss? O_o
[19:24:22] <ggreer> the issue is that you need extra staff to verify vaccination status
[19:24:53] <kuudes> but usa has already all sorts of greeters etc?
[19:25:14] <ggreer> at some restuarants, but not in places with high minimum wages like SF, and definitely not in fast food places

[19:25:35] <Robomot> The Fisherman's Wharf In-N-Out refused to check for proof of vaccination (The Fisherman's Wharf restaurant has since reopened but indoor dining is still...)
[19:26:54] <kuudes> over here, in restaurants that are subject to local restriction on opening times or seat availability, they can generally skip those restrictions if they check covid certificates

[19:28:23] <kuudes> well sure
[19:28:35] <kuudes> but you have to manage other diseases as well if you are a restaurant?
[19:28:38] <kuudes> salmonella etc
[19:28:40] <mst> SF's government is pretty much guaranteed to mis-implement any policy
[19:29:03] <kuudes> I mean, it would be faster if you didn't have to be generally hygienic
[19:29:12] <kuudes> people just would get a vomiting disease more often
[19:29:31] <kuudes> it is not that you can just open a restaurant and serve food, is it?
[19:30:04] <kuudes> but good that they have got to 3 deaths per month, that is really good
[19:30:13] <kuudes> we had 13 deaths yesterday iirc
[19:30:43] <kuudes> vaccination levels seem to be a bit lower here than there
[19:30:52] <mst> kuudes: if they allowed checking+full occupancy the numbers might work out commercially
[19:31:09] <mst> requiring extra staff -and- reduced capacity doesn't
[19:31:20] <mst> hospitality margins are razor thin at the best of times
[19:31:28] <kuudes> still, is catering very large part of economy?
[19:31:40] <kuudes> over here they have been the loudest, but they are something like 1% of gdp
[19:32:17] <mst> I think from my POV it's more a question of "wanting them to still be there to go to later"
[19:32:34] <kuudes> meh, restaurants go under all the time and new fools found new restaurants
[19:32:49] <kuudes> there are more people wanting to be a restauranter than there are customers for
[19:32:56] <mst> fair point
[19:33:28] <mst> but the policy is still stupid
[19:34:08] <kuudes> well, personally I am currently just for mandatory vaccinations
[19:34:18] <kuudes> they seem easier legally than this whole covid pass hassle
[19:34:38] <kuudes> we could even just make them mandatory but allow anyone who objects to remain unvaccinated
[19:34:47] <kuudes> or require a doctors certificate or something
[19:35:09] <kuudes> we already have mandatory vaccination articla on the law, but for some reason the government has not wanted to use it
[19:35:13] <mst> britain's approach of harassing you via SMS until you book an appointment seems to've worked out pretty decently
[19:35:24] <kuudes> we don't have even that yet
[19:35:47] <mjr> harrassment sounds good!
[19:36:01] <mjr> but yeah I wouldn't be opposed to mandatory vaccinations
[19:36:10] <kuudes> I mean, the rights have been thought with that law when it was made, a lot of human rights and constitutional experts etc were heard, and the constitutional committee specifically noted that it is ok
[19:36:18] <kuudes> and they used smallpox vaccination as the example
[19:36:45] <kuudes> which *kills* little fewer than 2 per million vaccinated, expectedly 9 in Finland's total population
[19:37:02] <kuudes> covid vaccines don't provably kill and seem to have even associated deaths less than that
[19:37:04] <ggreer> I could see mandatory vaccinations being a thing for a more deadly disease that was spreading like wildfire, but right now covid is just a disease that puts us back to life expectancy in 2003

[19:37:21] <kuudes> well, yes, if we would not treat people
[19:37:35] <kuudes> but as we have to treat the covid patients, the system will crash
[19:37:58] <ggreer> is that actually true? the real spike was in the winter of last year. we seemed to have handled that
[19:38:09] <kuudes> we didn't have such a spike
[19:38:24] <kuudes> over here only ~1000 persons have died to covid so far out of population of 5.5M
[19:38:32] <kuudes> so in usa that would be 60000 persons
[19:39:15] <kuudes> in finland about 50000 persons die in normal year. with current vaccination status I expect at least 2000 direct covid deaths in population
[19:39:24] <kuudes> but per each death there are 5 icu patient
[19:39:31] <kuudes> who spend about 2 weeks on icu
[19:39:34] <kuudes> so 10000 icuweeks
[19:39:51] <kuudes> we have 50 icu beds for them in normal state, 500 in the extreme Total War scenarios
[19:39:53] <feep> home~
[19:40:07] <mjr> yeah they take apparently ~3 times the time for an average icu patient
[19:40:08] <kuudes> no, not 10000 icuweeks, 20000 icuweeks
[19:40:49] <gwern> (everytime I spellcheck my past few months of annotations, I am amazed by the sheer ingenuity humans worldwide come up with in not just surnames but first names too. no matter how many tens of thousands of names I've added in total, I'll add another few hundred from the author lists)
[19:40:49] <kuudes> so if we have 50 icu beds for 20000 icu patients, that would take 400 weeks, with 500 beds it would take 40 weeks
[19:40:58] <kuudes> so something between 1-8 years
[19:41:18] <mjr> so then upon saturation you have to cancel three operations per covid icu patient or something
[19:41:18] <gwern> (by comparison, the actual typos like 'ancestory' are scarcely even noticeable. I just spend my time drumming 'i' to insert all these furriner names)
[19:41:22] <kuudes> ok, so that is the scenario where we will continue to keep lid on and manage the spread even a little. we seem to have stopped doing that
[19:41:49] <kuudes> so if the disease will ride its natural course, I guess it will ride over the population in about quarter of a year, 13 weeks

[19:42:29] <kuudes> that means we can take 13*500 = 6500 icuweeks out of it max, so we are left with 20000-6500 = 13500 icuweeks not served, ie 13500/2 = 6750 more deaths
[19:42:37] <kuudes> so 8750 deaths so far
[19:42:39] <Filipepe> Brazil's been lower than 400 deaths a while. It's a lot, but much less than it was months ago. The vaccination program is working, despite of Bolsonaro
[19:42:49] <kuudes> then we have all people who would otherwise come to icu in that quarter
[19:43:23] <kuudes> given a normal year kills 50000 persons, quarter kills 12500. icu usage seems likely to be at least 12500 at the same time, surely it is not that half of people in icu die? maybe?
[19:43:53] <mst> Filipepe: honestly given how unpopular he seems to be with most of the country I wonder if his opposition to it helped among a decent chunk of people
[19:43:54] <kuudes> so, we will then have 32750 deaths in a quarter compared to normal 12500
[19:44:04] <kuudes> whats that, 300% of normal deaths?
[19:44:17] <kuudes> some 70% or so of a year
[19:44:43] <kuudes> in usa that would be 1.8 million deaths
[19:44:59] <kuudes> (given usa has 60x population of finland)
[19:45:31] <kuudes> mind you that this is a minimum scenario, the raw numbers predict 14000 deaths instead of 2000. 2000 is with fudge of presuming we have had much undetected cases in the past

[20:57:10] <PapuaHardyNet> I wish I could outsource the consumption of things like novels, VNs, and video games. 
[20:57:27] <PapuaHardyNet> you know, get someone else to consume it, and then copy their memories into your brain
[20:57:52] <gwern> why don't you just lay on the floor and revisit your old memories, then, instead of bothering to consume new ones?
[20:58:12] <gwern> this also sounds like a great diet hack. don't eat that ice cream or french fries, just remember some of the thousands of previous instances
[20:58:59] <kiboneu> i do that all the time
[20:59:07] <kiboneu> you don't?
[20:59:12] <PapuaHardyNet> idk man, I have a huge reading list, gaming list, etc. and for one, I cannot keep up with the growth of the list, and second, I can't enjoy stuff like VNs without feeling like I'm wasting my time
[20:59:45] <kiboneu> ah, not enough time to even have consumed it in the past
[20:59:46] <kuudes> I have read wikipedia plot synopsis of many cultural artefacts
[20:59:55] <kuudes> saves time on tv series etc
[21:00:04] <PapuaHardyNet> yep, that's what I do with anime now
[21:00:20] <kiboneu> yeah i try to help that by watching things at 2x or 3x speed
[21:00:33] <spxtr> what is a VN?
[21:00:40] <PapuaHardyNet> won't you lose the experience of it by going 2x and 3x?
[21:01:17] <kiboneu> and building up my pattern recognition to skim books / readings so i can extract the most useful / prominent / novel idea and discard authors' attempts to further clarify it
[21:01:17] <PapuaHardyNet> spxtr: Visual Novels, aka video games with pictures and text, where you are given a limited set of choices throughout the game. 
[21:01:25] <spxtr> oh, right
[21:01:25] <gwern> I think it depends. some series you're just there for the plot, and not really focusing on the art
[21:01:41] <kiboneu> oh yeaH, i don't watch anime at 2x speed
[21:02:03] <kiboneu> if anything, i keep pausing and going back because artists will sprinkle in fun details / easter eggs
[21:02:07] <gwern> and it's good for shitty series which you can't bring yourself to quit. like _legend of the galactic heroes_ - I could've quit it after 10 eps with no loss, but I wanted to be able to rate the whole thing so, 2-3x actually fixed its intolerably slow pacing
[21:02:29] <PapuaHardyNet> the original or the new one? 
[21:03:00] <kiboneu> PapuaHardyNet: but yeah, mostly lectures / talks / interviews / presentations / etc. i 2x - 3x that
[21:03:12] <kiboneu> movies the timing is an interwoven part of the storytelling
[21:03:16] <kiboneu> with good movies at leasrt
[21:03:28] <kiboneu> i.e. don't skip the silent scenes in stalker
[21:04:06] <spxtr> I watched the whole of one piece, but I slept through about 1/2 of every other episode because I would watch it as I fell asleep.
[21:04:12] <spxtr> I don't think I missed anything.
[21:04:17] <PapuaHardyNet> tarkovsky? Yeah uh, I'm sorry, I couldn't even take a few minutes and skipped to the ending
[21:04:20] <kiboneu> PapuaHardyNet: in a way the internet does do the consuminbg for yopu, and gives you a highly abstract / lossy representation of the experinece
[21:04:29] <kiboneu> PapuaHardyNet: too bad. missed out
[21:05:06] <kiboneu> try again someday
[21:05:10] <PapuaHardyNet> I keep waiting for someone to want to watch the new Neon Genesis Evangelion movies so I have an excuse to finish the series

[21:08:50] <kiboneu> hehe
[21:09:09] <PapuaHardyNet> take a drink everytime I think of Asuka as cute 
[21:09:18] <PapuaHardyNet> or Shinji as cute for that matter
[21:09:52] <mst> my dad gave up on programming as a hobby because it stopped being nearly as fun when I got better at it than him ;)
[21:10:00] <kiboneu> or when my dopamine systems get poked on the sigh of misato having a hell of a beer
[21:10:35] <kiboneu> mst: haha. outdoing my dad is a prominent theme too

[21:19:30] <kiboneu> as a 4 year old i generated my first intentional memory, after my birthday party adults were telling me how they forgot what they did as 4 year olds
[21:19:46] <kiboneu> so i looked in the mirror and told myself that i will remember this day
[21:20:05] <adiabatic> I guess you still remember it
[21:20:16] <adiabatic> mission accomplished so far?
[21:20:56] <kiboneu> (i was kind of confused how adults could forget so much in the first place, so it was kind of an experiment -- ok, if i remember this day for every day onwards, will i remember this moment? it was also kind of uncomfortable at the time)

[21:21:19] <kiboneu> and i shall do this again, now

[21:26:44] <pompolic> that reference is lost on me
[21:26:47] <pompolic> what do you mean?
[21:27:05] <kiboneu> it's an isekai where the main character returns to a checkpoint ~24 hours before every time he dies
[21:27:29] <kiboneu> so he uses information from the alternative futures (in which he dies) to make better decisions in the next
[21:27:38] <PapuaHardyNet> are you sure it is 24 hours?
[21:27:38] <pompolic> ah, savescumming
[21:27:40] <kiboneu> he dies a lot
[21:27:50] <kiboneu> PapuaHardyNet: no, hence the ~
[21:28:02] <kiboneu> it's a fixed point in time, not sure what it's usually determined by
[21:28:15] <PapuaHardyNet> it is usually determined by succeeding a hidden objective
[21:28:17] <kiboneu> usually at convenient moments but sometimes his decisions get locked
[21:28:22] <Betawolf> the main character goes absolutely mental at a point in s1
[21:28:22] <kiboneu> ahh
[21:28:23] <PapuaHardyNet> which usually is "survive this arc"
[21:28:28] <Betawolf> and indeed generally
[21:28:38] <kiboneu> i wasn't so sure if it was that concrete
[21:28:45] <pompolic> code geass r3 did something similar
[21:28:48] <kiboneu> success could have been just surviving longer in a timeline than another
[21:29:05] <kiboneu> i think there was a point where he was trapped in some next stage...

[21:30:50] <kiboneu> hmmmm i like this proposition. yeh let's do it
[21:30:58] <Betawolf> sure. It's a good thing about the series, he's realistically very flawed and doesn't cope with a lot of it well.

[21:32:04] <kiboneu> basically power fantasy
[21:32:05] <Betawolf> a lot of s1 is him being all the anime jackass archetypes and getting punched in the face by reality for it

[21:34:34] <PapuaHardyNet> the director's cut is more polished in subtle ways, and makes subaru look less of a retard in the beginning
[21:34:49] <pompolic> also, re: checkpoints, at some point i started anticipating i would be "modified" in the sense by internalizing norms i at the time didn't like

[23:38:57] <feep> rmmh: "We'll bang, okay."
[23:41:37] <gwern> rmmh: so what is New World and how did they manage to screw up literally fake imaginary fantasy gold so badly
[23:41:52] <pompolic> if only they had read richard bartle!
[23:42:18] <rmmh> gwern: there's simply far more gold sinks than sources
[23:42:30] <rmmh> you have to pay gold in upkeep on houses, regions, taxes, etc
[23:42:32] <gwern> rmmh: yeah but this is literally 'money printers go n++'
[23:42:48] <rmmh> yes, they need to rebalance the money printer, obviously
[23:42:50] <gwern> it's literally all made up, from the 'taxes' to the 'gold'. how the heck do you manage *deflation*
[23:42:54] <pompolic> "we'll have a closed economy", NARRATOR: the economy wasn't closed
[23:43:01] <rmmh> "As of right now, the only way to “create” currency is through monster drops, salvage, and quests. The rate at which any given player can extract it, is simply not sustainable."
[23:43:40] <kuudes> players can kill monsters too fast?
[23:43:43] <gwern> yes, 'monster drops' ie a few madeup numbers in a computer database. 'salvage', a few madeup numbers in a computer database. 'quests'... need I go on
[23:43:51] <pompolic> ". Since New World doesn’t have vendors to set a hard price-floor for a given good, this means that given enough deflation, goods will eventually be priced at the lowest possible price, 0.01 coin per unit. "
[23:43:55] <pompolic> interdasting
[23:44:24] <kuudes> why won't they just lower the loots?
[23:44:29] <pompolic> anyway yeah why not just buff the drops
[23:44:38] <gwern> I've heard of MMORPGs struggling with inflation because you can't just take away player money without them being made, but this may be the first time I've ever heard of one tanking its economy by *deflation*
[23:44:58] <rmmh> comedy bezos refuses to pay players more option
[23:45:33] <kuudes> wait, what are those goods that are sold for the gold and how are they created?
[23:45:55] <rmmh> kuudes: there's an auction house where you can list goods for sale
[23:46:03] <ggreer> https://twitter.com/interest_mild/status/1450873105098936324 oh man "United States of Earth" would be badass
[23:46:06] <gwern> * being mad / and there's a bullwhip effect where you might not realize you inflated the money supply badly until too late
[23:46:46] <pompolic> i dunno
[23:46:48] <rmmh> ggreer: that 1916 one is nice too
[23:46:54] <ggreer> yeah
[23:47:04] <rmmh> skin in the game and all that
[23:47:11] <pompolic> given that it was pointed out in Designing Virtual Worlds, i'm sure that some MUDs experienced deflation
[23:48:29] <rmmh> "American citizens should have the alienable right to an environment free of pollution" oh, so you can still opt into pollution?
[23:49:03] <gwern> I'd expect mild deflation at most. perhaps as sequelae to taming inflation where you realize you overdid it, or you're deliberately trying to wind back some of the price level changes... but severe deflation such that transactions in the numeraire might actually stop because everything has fallen through the floor, that's just WTF
[23:49:08] <gwern> it's so much easier to inflate than deflate
[23:49:19] <feep> it's not easy to inflate
[23:49:31] <rmmh> they just need to boost the gold drops from mobs
[23:49:35] <kuudes> well, yes, actually, as we see in japan, germany, etc
[23:49:42] <feep> well, it's not easy to inflate if you're refusing to just give your citizens money
[23:49:44] <rmmh> inflation is easy as long as you can print money
[23:49:50] <feep> in the same sense that it is hard to drive a nail if one refuses the hammer
[23:49:51] <rmmh> yes, inflation is hard if you don't give out money
[23:50:00] <feep> but that is the world in which we live, so
[23:50:07] <kuudes> is there a german running that game?
[23:51:52] <gwern> feep: it's super easy to inflate, even in the real world. just run the money printers. and keep adding zeros until you have inflation. you'll either get inflation or you'll wind up owning everything in the world, at which point you won't care that you failed to increase inflation
[23:52:19] <feep> gwern you are missing the problem where you have to be willing and capable to give people money
[23:52:27] <gwern> the reason countries like japan don't inflate is because they don't *want* to
[23:52:33] <rmmh> having player-run economies is real tricky. Eve lets an economist play god planning out how to keep things reasonable
[23:53:07] <rmmh> I think it was Ultima Online that tried to have realistic ecosystems with predator/prey relationships, then discovered that actually players will murder all animals on sight
[23:53:18] <feep> like I can only speak for germany but there's genuinely ideological difficulty with the idea
[23:53:19] <gwern> which is a weird reason for New World to have deflation... people don't generally have problems like large retiree lobbies or misguided cultural ideologies about all inflation being bad when it comes to MMORPGs
[23:54:30] <gwern> my guess would be either (a) really incompetent devs or (b) we don't understand the (real-world) economics and incentives of New World and how deflation is a least-bad answer to some problem of theirs
[23:55:00] <rmmh> it *did* just release
[23:55:17] <rmmh> maybe they didn't run the numbers to balance sources and sinks
[23:55:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: No, I don't think it's the same thing
[23:56:19] <gwern> rmmh: you think they're too busy putting out other fires?
[23:56:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: To see the difference, consider the case of the paradigmatic neoconservative war hawk
[23:56:27] <ggreer> it had been a few years since I read *The Peace War*. for a book written in 1984, it held up pretty well. I don't know how much vinge intended it while writing it, but The Peace Authority's worldview has quite a few parallels to modern governments
[23:56:45] <ggreer> they restrict others from having many technologies because they claim they're damaging, while using those same technologies to enforce said restrictions. they bar immigration into Authority enclaves (which are far wealthier than everyone else)
[23:57:14] <ggreer> the later generations of Authority leaders are incompetent hedonists (unlike the people who founded the Authority)
[23:59:25] <pompolic> rmmh: yeah afaik that was Ultima Online. there was an Ars Technica video on it (in the War Stories series)
