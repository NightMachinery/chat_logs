[00:07:53] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: technically I'm assuming F(x) and G(x) are defined on some connected interval [a,b]. If your domain isn't connected h(x) is only locally constant.

[00:09:36] <cuppajoeman> Cool. I see what you're doing
[00:09:45] <somiaj> the classic example is int 1/x dx = ln(x) + C1 if x>0 and ln(-x) + C2 if x<0
[00:10:02] <somiaj> that ln|x| + C misses lots of possible antiderivatives, since (-inf,0)U(0,inf) isn't connected

[00:11:46] <cuppajoeman> How do we know that the only thing witg derivative zero is the constant?
[00:12:17] <somiaj> This requires h'(x) = 0 for all x on [a,b]
[00:12:41] <somiaj> from there you can show h(x) = C on [a,b]
[00:12:54] <cuppajoeman> Using epsilon?
[00:13:00] <somiaj> Here it might take some work, but I think you can do this from the limit definition
[00:14:21] <somiaj> actually I think the mean value theorem works here
[00:15:04] <somiaj> assume h(x) is not constant, since h(x) is continous and h(a) != h(b), there exists a c in [a,b] such that h'(c) = (h(b) - h(a))/(b-a)
[00:15:30] <somiaj> but this is non-zero, contradiction (and see why you need h'(x) = 0 on all of [a,b]
[00:15:39] <somiaj> to ensure that such a c exists.

[00:17:24] <somiaj> I also guess you could do it straight forward to, no need to use contradicition, assume h'(x) = 0 for all x in [a,b], then for all c in (a,b] the mean value theorem states that there exists d in [a,c] such that h'(d) = (h(c) - h(a))/(c - a) = 0

[03:44:25] <brownorange> distinction without a difference tbh. axiom system can be given in schematic form
[03:44:53] <brownorange> i may as well declare incompleteness doesn't apply because muh schema. which is silly
[03:45:20] <PlanckWalk> There's a big difference.
[03:45:56] <PlanckWalk> And yes, your silly statement is indeed silly.
[03:46:10] <brownorange> http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/mmset.html#schemes  given as schemes you will notice
[03:46:21] <brownorange> but you will notice each is still a true/false formula
[03:46:58] <PlanckWalk> What do you mean by "each"?
[03:47:03] <PlanckWalk> Each schema?
[03:47:21] <brownorange> each axiom
[03:47:26] <brownorange> http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/ax-4.html this is true/false
[03:47:28] <PlanckWalk> Each axiom is, yes.
[03:47:43] <PlanckWalk> No, each schema is an *infinite collection* of formulas.
[03:47:56] <PlanckWalk> They just share common structure.
[03:48:27] <PlanckWalk> In particular it's possible for an interpretation to have some of the formulas true and some false.
[03:49:06] <brownorange> PlanckWalk I can reference each axiom, scheme or not, and AND them together. nothing changes
[03:49:17] <PlanckWalk> You can't AND together infinitely many propositions.
[03:49:25] <brownorange> because (A and B) |- A   also (A and B) |- B
[03:49:26] <PlanckWalk> (Not in standard first-order logic)
[03:49:44] <PlanckWalk> You would need some form of infinitary logic for that.
[03:50:04] <brownorange> all you need is a knowledge of propositional calculus
[03:50:33] <PlanckWalk> I keep remembering why I stopped talking with you last time.  Please learn more about logic.

[04:03:12] <PlanckWalk> If you want an infinitary logic, read up on infinitary logics.  Just don't pretend that PA uses an infinitary logic.
[04:03:43] <brownorange> but there isn't an infinite number of interpretations at the propositional level
[04:04:43] <brownorange> a -> (b -> a)  this is not a boogie man, contradictory interpretations are possible but not interesting since it is a tautology
[04:05:41] <PlanckWalk> So?  Say something that makes sense and is relevant to what we were talking about.
[04:06:26] <brownorange> what does predicate calculus use schemes, but propositional does not?
[04:07:12] <PlanckWalk> It wouldn't make much sense to use schemes in propositional logic.
[04:07:30] <PlanckWalk> I mean, in principle you *could*, but there's not much point.
[04:09:28] <brownorange> (𝑥 = 𝑦 → (𝑧 ∈ 𝑥 → 𝑧 ∈ 𝑦)) this, is a propositional involving predicate calculus. You could imagine non-PA uses for it, because it's just predicate calculus. But that reality is neither here nor there because you could do the same for any propositional

[04:13:04] <PlanckWalk> PA *is* a formal system.  That's what the letters mean.
[04:13:35] <PlanckWalk> (I mean really they name a class of formal systems that are all equivalent, but meh)
[04:14:21] <brownorange> Axioms of PA, which should be formulas themselves, there is a set of formulas that is PA or not
[04:15:16] <brownorange> a set is a union of the elements of that set
[04:16:18] <brownorange> and for the record i hate the idea of infinitary logic
[04:16:25] <PlanckWalk> Let's just get one thing legible: have you read Gödel's actual proof, or any reasonable translation of it?
[04:16:43] <PlanckWalk> Or are you just relying on second- or third-hand discussions of it?
[04:17:12] <brownorange> i've read the stanford page best i can, and yes seen many very confusing second and thirst hand sources
[04:17:28] <PlanckWalk> If you have, then you can ask about specific parts of it and maybe make some progress.
[04:17:34] <PlanckWalk> If you haven't, then do that.

[04:18:39] <brownorange> you appear to be stressing skepticism about representability
[04:19:20] <PlanckWalk> I'm stressing that you learn what the terms used in the proof actually mean.
[04:20:43] <PlanckWalk> Because the way you use the terms in here implies that you don't.
[04:21:02] <PlanckWalk> Err, haven't*
[04:22:02] <brownorange> What things actually mean in this cases, is more like theorem hunting

[14:09:53] <taeaad> I almost wanted to go down Wildberger's rabbit hole until I realised his argument is essentially an argument that has been there since before Cantor. Cantor essentially tried to solve the issue (what are the reals) and was led to set theory, essentially. People agree generally that he formalised what people had been doing implicitly.
[14:11:02] <cadmio> I don't understand what relation involving binomial coefficient is this get_current_buffer
[14:11:04] <joel135> i think our formalization(s) of real numbers is sad
[14:11:09] <taeaad> joel135: His work was very focused on number theory, so it depends whether you prefer number theory or set theory. But his diagonal argument for example is a good intersection of the two. Perhaps his original writing on the diagonal argument would be a good starting point.
[14:11:32] <taeaad> joel135: Dedekind cuts are not sad :) I think they are quite natural.
[14:11:32] <cadmio> https://imgur.com/q2sC1lX.png
[14:12:01] <joel135> i know the diagonal argument. i have been struggling with real numbers for almost a decade.
[14:12:13] <taeaad> You can do the diagonal argument in binary and then it would be even clearer.
[14:12:28] <taeaad> In the binary representation instead of decimal.
[14:13:16] <taeaad> joel135: I think it's a fair thing to struggle with. My approach to reals is essentially that they come up in topology. So I generally think of them as "topological".
[14:13:32] <joel135> i like aspects of (1) dedekind cuts, (2) cauchy sequences, (3) binary/decimal expansions, (4) axiomatic characterization. but none of them gives me tools to do new exact calculations like e^(pi*i) = -1. they don't lead anywhere new. maybe you wouldn't require a formalization of a field to lead anywhere new, but i would.
[14:13:58] <joel135> oh yes, good point. (5) the geometric/topological notion of 'line'.
[14:14:44] <taeaad> You need e.g. reals for studying regular topological spaces. The regular seperation axiom can be thought of as equivalent to the existence of a function into [0,1] sending the one closed neighbourhood to 0 and the other to 1.
[14:15:57] <taeaad> But where I do agree with Wildberger is that I don't think reals are "necessary" as often as they are used.

[14:19:44] <taeaad> Wildberger, for what it's worth is essentially just in the same camp as Brouwer was. It's this notion that "mathematics should be more intuitive". But the thing is that... any good mathematics teacher _should_ make mathematics intuitive to the students.

[14:37:28] <taeaad> Sorry, I didn't mean unital as in having a unit. Unital as in having an identity. Sets have identity functions x |-> x for each x in the set X. But you wouldn't normally call that "unital". Depends a bit on terminology.
[14:38:00] <joel135> refactoring can be motivated

[14:38:28] <taeaad> greenbagels: Yes, I was trying to avoid that!
[14:39:01] <greenbagels> taeaad: right but i mean the unital in that case refers to the identity part

[14:40:27] <joel135> it is not necessarily bad to 'grow resentful' of things that 'don't motivate one'. it depends on the context.
[14:40:28] <taeaad> You can recover rings with identity from rings without identity by using product with Z, but anyway, both types of rings form a category. But yes, this was the use case I was alluding to. Units in a category are external to the object; unity in an object is internal.
[14:40:44] <cadmio> greenbagels: I don't think it is like a k in:  n ⋅ ( n − 1 ) ⋯ ( n − k + 1 )/ k !
[14:40:59] <greenbagels> cadmio: it appears in the binomial coefficient expansion
[14:41:32] <taeaad> But not internal is in "internal to the category". Internal as in, we don't have a way to look into the objects of a category other than via morphisms. My research is about internalising objects, which is why I call it "category theory applied to set theory" and not just one of the two.

[15:07:12] <taeaad> But I'll check this and see if it is as I would expect.
[15:07:43] <taeaad> You would have to characterise the Sierpinsky space in an arbitrary category. Then it either exists or not.

[15:32:25] <Z-module> to expand on what greenbagels said, it comes down to: If  A = B/C  where A,B,C are all positive integers, then A has a certain unique factorization, and in that, if some  p^m  occurs (p prime), then the power of p in the factorization of B has to be to a power exactly  m more than its power in the factorization of C.

[15:54:48] <[-_-]> sorry
[15:55:01] <[-_-]> \lambda (a|x|+b|y|+c|z|)
[15:55:02] <quantum> lockywolf: `exp(λx)` is an eigenfunction of `d/dx` with eigenvalue `λ`

[15:55:28] <quantum> [-_-]: not quite, `x, y` and `z` have different eigenvalues, but you're basically there
[15:55:29] <[-_-]> c^2
[15:55:41] <[-_-]> yeah...that also
[15:57:02] <[-_-]> then then?
[15:58:08] <quantum> (just to clarify) if `v = ax + by + cz`, we have `v.(Av) =  λ_x a^2 |x|^2 + λ_y b^2 |y|^2 + λ_z c^2 |z|^2
[15:58:29] <[-_-]> yeah
[15:58:34] <greenbagels> HisShadow: perhaps there's a mutual misunderstanding? maybe he meant if lambda is indeed an eigenvalue, then its eigenspace is nontrivial?
[15:58:50] <[-_-]> thanks for clarifying
[15:58:50] <HisShadow> greenbagels: yeah, probably
[15:59:24] <quantum> and we can then replace `x, y, z` by `x/|x|^2, y/|y|^2, z/|z|^2` respectively so that the final expression becomes `v.(Av) = λ_x a^2 + λ_y b^2 + λ_z c^2`
[15:59:30] *** Joins: dez_ (uid92154@id-92154.lymington.irccloud.com)
[16:00:32] <quantum> (obv. the exact values of `a, b, c` will change, but you can just assume we started with `x, y, z` such that `|x|^2 = |y|^2 = |z|^2 = 1` to begin with, this is always possible unless any of `x, y, z` are zero)
[16:01:27] <Z-module> HisShadow: right, such a matrix has a char.poly. with no real eigenvalues at all. (if the rotation isn't through an integer multiple of pi radians, obviously)  So tehre's no lambda to talk about in that case. I was answering a question where the eigenvalue lambda is given to exist already.
[16:01:37] <quantum> Expansions like this are really useful when you're applying linear algebra, since the expression of the norm is so nice
[16:01:40] <Z-module> and you never need to say "nontrivial eigenspace" - they always are.
[16:01:42] <Z-module> by definition
[16:02:31] <greenbagels> quantum: for a second i was really hoping you were about to guide them through the spectral theorem
[16:03:15] <quantum> greenbagels: that's probably a good link
[16:03:27] <quantum> I was about to finish with a tangent about QM
[16:03:52] <quantum> but [-_-]: A really good example of this is Quantum Mechanics, where `v.(Av)` represents the "expectation value" of `A` in some sense (though your vector space is a function space)
[16:04:22] <greenbagels> presumably that's the relevant detail; i imagine if they mention eigenfunction before eigenvector (as in their question), they might be working on that area...?

[18:35:46] <Z-module> I wouldn't say the FTC is involved here. The general antiderivative of 2e^t + 4cos(t) is  p'(t) = 2e^t + 4sin(t) + C   so the FTC tells you that  \int_[a,b] (2e^t + 4cos(t)) dt = p'(b) - p'(a), in which C is now gone.  Setting a = 0, with the information p'(0) = 0, merely gives you p'(b) = 2e^b + 4sin(b) + C  which we knew already. THis problem is simply finding the general antiderivative and then *using* p'(0) = 0 to find C.

[22:09:23] <traxex> I would stop thinking and just do it
[22:09:56] <traxex> maybe there's a clever simple answer but when brute force takes a couple of minutes, brute force
[22:10:34] <tolarz> nah, thinking is easier
[22:10:41] <tolarz> look at each conjunct, and what it gives
[22:10:46] <tolarz> (1) p
[22:10:53] <tolarz> (2) p => ~q, with (1) thus ~q
[22:11:00] <tolarz> (3) p => ~s, with (1) thus ~s
[22:11:29] <tolarz> (4) r \/ q, with the reasoning of ~q above, this implies r
[22:12:02] <pikapika> biberao, x => y = notx + y
[22:12:11] <pikapika> you can simplify the rest now
[22:12:20] <traxex> yes on second thought
[22:12:32] <biberao> tolarz: p => ~q comes out false
[22:12:53] <biberao> so i can say "~q"?
[22:13:07] <pikapika> p -> q' = p'+q'
[22:13:12] <traxex> p /\ (p => X) is easy to simplify

[22:14:03] <traxex> isn't it*
[22:14:17] <biberao> im confused now
[22:14:21] <pikapika> traxex, yes
[22:14:43] <pikapika> biberao, implication isn't an "implication" its just a logical operation
[22:14:51] <pikapika> x implies y is the same as x'+y
[22:14:52] <traxex> so you have p /\ ~q /\ ~s /\ (r \/ q)
[22:14:59] <biberao> x'+y?
[22:15:03] <pikapika> yes
[22:15:04] <traxex> which is  p /\ ~q /\ ~s /\ r
[22:15:06] <biberao> whats that
[22:15:09] <traxex> because q is false
[22:15:15] <pikapika> (not x) or y
[22:15:47] <biberao> the question is
[22:16:07] <biberao> they say to assume all is true
[22:16:21] <traxex> that means p is true, q is false, s is false, r is true
[22:16:34] <biberao> traxex: i dont want the solution yet
[22:16:46] <pikapika> simplify the expression first
[22:17:06] <biberao> pikapika: a p => ~q is a false
[22:17:25] <pikapika> what
[22:17:40] <biberao> ?
[22:18:07] <biberao> is it not?

[22:19:07] <biberao> pikapika: i dont get that notation

[22:20:10] <biberao> you guys are not answering my question

[22:21:10] <biberao> if p => ~q "~q" is what we get?

[22:22:37] <tolarz> "implication elimination (or modus ponens, however you call it...)"
[22:22:56] <tolarz> that's a rule saying that if you have, in general, (1) A and (2) A => B, then you can conlude B
[22:23:04] <tolarz> or, more formally,
[22:23:21] <tolarz> if (1) A is provable, and (2) A => B is provable (e.g., because both are assumptions as is the case for you), then

[23:50:44] <cuppajoeman> For example sin(x) and my (a, b) is (2, 3)

[23:51:20] <cuppajoeman> Ah in that case the inverse image of (a,b) is the empty set, and so therefore it's open wrt to R
[23:51:37] <cuppajoeman> So I may assume that the inverse image of (a, b) is non-empty?

[23:54:19] <tolarz> if it is empty, you're done anyway, since the empty set is open
[23:54:48] <tolarz> but wait -- you may not assume f to be injective
[23:54:51] <tolarz> so f^-1 may be a set
[23:54:55] <tolarz> of preimages

[23:56:44] <cuppajoeman> Ah ok, let me rethink
