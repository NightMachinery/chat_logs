[03:13:06] <Alex123> hey everyone, does anyone have experience fetching data form gmail using smtp. I have no problem fetching the data. I am having two problems 1) Its only returns oldest 290 results. 2) I can not order to get 290 newest one, I have tried changing order  (imap_sort order reverse by date) nothing chages
[03:13:09] <Alex123> changes
[03:14:23] <Alex123> any idea how to get newest emails from gmail using smtp
[03:14:43] <Alex123> (I can not use gmail api for this project )
[03:24:06] <Blondie101010> not seeing what you're seeing makes it even more difficult, but I'm having a hard time finding any plausible explanation why imap would only give you the 290 oldest message
[03:24:08] <Blondie101010> s
[03:24:59] <Blondie101010> I suspect you're looking at the wrong imap path
[03:39:24] *** Joins: sheepduck (~sheepduck@user/sheepduck)
[03:40:41] <da_wunder> that sounds a bit weird - why you cannot use gmail api?
[03:41:07] <Alex123> $connection =imap_open("{"."$host:$port/pop3/ssl/novalidate-cert"."}$folder",$user,$pass)
[03:41:07] <Alex123> $count = imap_num_msg($connection);
[03:41:07] <Alex123> var_dump($count);
[03:41:18] <__adrian> Alex123: don't dump cod eon the channel
[03:42:27] <Blondie101010> Alex123:  ok so that folder shows you 290 messages?
[03:42:49] <Blondie101010> did you check others?
[03:43:21] <Alex123> it has over 4000
[03:43:24] <Blondie101010> it's more common/normal to only get the latest messagestheir
[03:43:31] <Blondie101010> -their
[03:43:40] <Blondie101010> did you check other folders?
[03:43:45] <Alex123> yea this what I want to do , but I get 290 oldest once
[03:44:09] <da_wunder> use eg. gist.github.com to share that
[03:45:57] <Blondie101010> I suspect your classification is not the way you imagine it....  using another email client could possibly help you see it more clearly
[03:47:15] <Alex123> I try connecting from k9 email client from phone it using the same pop3 settings for testing
[03:47:22] <Alex123> and it fetch everything fine
[03:47:26] <Blondie101010> you said imap earlier
[03:47:43] <Alex123> please check 4:11
[03:47:52] <Alex123> imap is the method but connects to pop3
[03:48:06] <Blondie101010> right ok
[03:48:54] <Blondie101010> not sure I understand what you're trying to do
[03:49:00] <Blondie101010> pop3 and imap do not work the same way
[03:49:07] <da_wunder> hmm, "02:17 < Alex123> please check 4:11" you really should share that code...
[03:49:39] <Alex123> php imap method supports both imap and pop3
[03:49:46] <Blondie101010> not my point
[03:49:59] <Blondie101010> if you don't know the difference, use imap or go read
[03:50:33] <Blondie101010> it won't get the same results and they will not be organized the same way
[03:51:45] <Blondie101010> imap is closer to their web interface

[03:53:20] <Blondie101010> I said it like that because gmail.com now uses tags instead of directories, but it maps them to directories for imap
[03:57:55] <Alex123> my current problem is the limit
[03:57:59] <Alex123> this 290
[03:58:06] <Alex123> where it is coming from
[03:58:21] <Alex123> even order is wrong I can pull all messages and parse them later
[03:58:28] <Blondie101010> you have not replied to my multiple requests to check another directory, so good luck
[03:59:02] <Blondie101010> I do not believe that 290 is a credible limit unless you specify that somewhere in your code
[04:00:09] <Alex123> pop3 has no directory structure, only INBOX
[04:00:33] <Alex123> even if I remove that from connection string I get the same result
[04:02:25] <Blondie101010> if you send yourself a new message, does it get 291?
[04:04:36] <da_wunder> don't see that on docs - https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.imap-num-msg.php
[04:05:07] <da_wunder> so most likely something else going on - or something that we don't know
[04:05:29] <Alex123> mail box has over 6000 emails, it does not fetch newest but oldest 290
[04:06:14] <Alex123> One thing I found is when using connection string, some of mail servers do the sort order based on username prefix instead of params
[04:06:28] <Alex123> recent:username@example.com
[04:06:39] <Alex123> will make it fetch recent once
[04:07:30] <da_wunder> so maybe something related to your smtp server provider - because docs doesn't tell anything like that

[12:57:14] <TinoDidriksen> PHP's arrays are ordered associative containers. They're great and flexible to work with, but that comes with a cost.

[13:05:08] <no_gravity> An empty entry in an SplFixedArray seems to take about 10 bytes: https://3v4l.org/gdkX6
[13:05:56] <no_gravity> Since the array sized is fixed, I wonder what those 10 bytes are used for. I would have expected each entry holds a pointer to the value.
[13:06:06] <no_gravity> But 10 bytes seems big for a pointer.
[13:06:33] <arash> I need to export/import customers info from a database, there is a password field that i think encrypted, "461875e9ae671c7407db3944943b3382:00" is one example, any idea how to decode this ? is it md5 ?
[13:07:43] <no_gravity> arash: 32 hexadecimal values plus a misterious :00.
[13:09:16] <no_gravity> arash: So the part left of the : could be an md5 hash. Or any other hash with 32 hexadecimal values.
[13:09:43] <no_gravity> arash: There is no way to "decode" a hash. Since a hashing is something else then encoding.
[13:11:44] <no_gravity> My gut feeling tells me that the :00 part is a salt.
[13:12:00] <biberu> no_gravity: that doesn't seem right, the elements of an splfixedarray are pointers to zvals: https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/PHP-8.0.9/ext/spl/spl_fixedarray.c#L42
[13:12:26] <biberu> no_gravity: see the last paragraph in the article that Naktibalda linked too
[13:12:30] <no_gravity> biberu: So they should be smaller than 10 bytes?
[13:13:35] <biberu> larger: https://www.phpinternalsbook.com/php5/zvals/basic_structure.html
[13:14:29] <no_gravity> biberu: I see. This indeed hints at it being 16 bytes: https://3v4l.org/fCUT5
[13:14:50] <biberu> perhaps they are smaller these days, that article is for 5
[13:15:13] <arash> no_gravity, here is another example : 6b2961ecbdbe26863c035b792b09c84b:8a

[13:16:04] <no_gravity> Interesting. What do you do in PHP if you want to store a lot of - say - integers in an array? Pay 16 bytes per integer?
[13:17:23] <biberu> personally i'd use a language better suited to processing large amounts of data
[13:18:12] <no_gravity> I would just pay the price of 16 bytes per integer :)
[13:21:09] <biberu> i think it looks like this now? https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/PHP-8.0.9/Zend/zend_types.h#L305

[13:40:03] <biberu> when all you need is an ordered map perhaps
[13:40:37] <AllenJB> I think it's more the way each value in an array independently stores its own type, and that they're designed to (also) act as hashmaps.

[13:49:02] <no_gravity> Ok, he claims to achieved a 50% memory reduction by using a class instead of an array.
[13:50:52] <no_gravity> But he only did that for an array/class with 2 properties.
[13:51:25] <no_gravity> His outter container with 1 million values is still an array.
[13:52:43] <Nomikos> point is to show arrays require more memory, basically, which starts being a thing if you require a ton of them

[13:56:45] <no_gravity> I see.
[13:57:59] <biberu> i don't know, but since an array keep track of the number of items etc. you'd have to pay that once per instance, and that'd get worse with many smaller arrays

[13:59:38] <biberu> i guess it's this? https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/PHP-8.0.9/Zend/zend_types.h#L359
[14:00:03] <no_gravity> biberu: I see it now.
[14:00:26] <biberu> using that as e.g. a tuple of two ints wouldn't be very efficient usage of memory
[14:00:43] <no_gravity> Yeah
[14:01:09] <no_gravity> What is everyone in this channel doing all day? Are you employed/freelancers/entrepreneurs/fulltimeircchatters?
[14:01:27] <no_gravity> I for one run some websites.
[14:02:56] * Nomikos is employed, LAMP & system maintenance. 10 years of freelance in between jobs
[14:03:26] <no_gravity> Nomikos: Nice. You prefer fulltime over freelancing?
[14:03:47] <Nomikos> it's more stability, which I started to need
[14:03:56] <no_gravity> Nomikos: Because family?
[14:04:32] <Nomikos> nah, personal matters :)
[14:04:39] <no_gravity> I see.
[14:08:25] <SilverEagleDev> no_gravity I'm basically a full-time FOSS maintainer :)
[14:08:59] <no_gravity> SilverEagleDev: You maintain a FOSS project, aka you keep developing it?
[14:09:09] <SilverEagleDev> Yep created and maintained it for many years now
[14:09:56] <no_gravity> SilverEagleDev: Nice. What is the business model?
[14:10:14] <SilverEagleDev> Currently "starvation and begging at the end of every month for donations to cover rent and groceries"
[14:10:29] <SilverEagleDev> we're trialing the idea of a support services business model but it's been pretty volatile tbh
[14:10:37] <no_gravity> SilverEagleDev: Haha. Begging how?
[14:11:02] <SilverEagleDev> On social media, and personal media...donations are down actually year-over-year :/
[14:11:36] <no_gravity> SilverEagleDev: And how did the people get to your social media?
[14:11:47] <SilverEagleDev> I don't know what you mean
[14:11:55] <SilverEagleDev> the project has its own social media and I have my own
[14:12:16] <SilverEagleDev> people find either because they're linked in various places
[14:13:24] <no_gravity> SilverEagleDev: I see. I never looked into social media much. I have a bunch of people tweeting about my websites every day. But I don't do any social media myself.
[14:14:32] <no_gravity> But it makes me happy to see all the stuff that people tweet and how they like my projects.

[23:10:09] <Byteflux> actually APCu doesn't even include the opcode cache anymore, so your issue is maybe opcache extension itself i guess

[23:26:39] <kittonian> i am
[23:26:48] <kittonian> i changed it to 64 and then 32 and received two different errors
[23:26:54] <kittonian> both reflective of the change

[23:28:40] <Byteflux> kittonian: are you running this in a container or VM or something?

[23:33:33] <kittonian> nope, just straight libphp7.so with apache
[23:35:29] <Byteflux> strange really. i don't really run into opcache issues, kind of just works out of the box. are you able to run this from the command line and pastebin the output (not in channel)? php -d opcache.enable_cli=1 -r 'var_dump(opcache_get_status());'
[23:38:24] <kittonian> not a big trace
[23:38:24] <kittonian> PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught Error: Call to undefined function opcache_get_status() in Command line code:1
[23:38:37] <Byteflux> oh, guess it's not loaded via your cli php
[23:38:39] <kittonian> probably because it's disabled in php.ini
[23:38:58] <Byteflux> might want to just try creating a simple .php file with the contents `<?php opcache_reset();` and having apache/mod_php process it
[23:45:43] <kittonian> i cannot start apache so that won't work
[23:45:52] <kittonian> that's the entire problem
[23:47:51] <Byteflux> oh well, figured it was just erroring on execution of a particular script
