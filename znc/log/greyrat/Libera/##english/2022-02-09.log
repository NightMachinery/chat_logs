[05:13:34] <CuriosTiger> TimMc: I think it's because there's no distinction between the adjective and the verb.
[05:13:39] <CuriosTiger> err, adjective and noun.
[05:13:55] <CuriosTiger> so your brain hears "a French" and parses that as an adjective. It expects a noun to follow.
[05:15:00] <CuriosTiger> whereas when you hear 'a Swede', that's unambiguously a noun.
[05:15:28] <CuriosTiger> At least, that's my personal hypothesis for why "a Frenchman" sounds better and "a Swedeman" just sounds dumb.
[05:15:48] <Me-me> Didn't we have this conversation just last week?
[05:16:03] <CuriosTiger> you apparently had it about an hour ago.

[05:22:24] <CuriosTiger> Me-me: You *can* say "a French". It just sounds a bit odd. As for why "a German" works better than "a French", I don't have a good answer.
[05:22:28] <CuriosTiger> but I agree that it does.
[05:22:48] <LjL> CuriosTiger, what sorry i don't speak Englishman
[05:23:29] <CuriosTiger> LjL: It's funny that English has this problem with referring to the English.
[05:23:56] <CuriosTiger> I usually prefer the proper noun "Briton", but you have to thread carefully.
[05:24:04] <LjL> i suspect it's a problem only insofar as the -men -woman way isn't universal, which i suspect is mostly due *to* French
[05:24:17] <CuriosTiger> That's possible.
[05:24:17] <kurahaupo> Me-me: Some words have different forms for nouns, adjects, verbs, etc; but in some cases they're the same. So "German" is both the noun and adjective form, but "French" and "France" are the adjective and noun forms of the same root word.
[05:24:40] <CuriosTiger> A Chinese man works. A Chineseman in one word doesn't. And "Chinaman" sounds racist.
[05:25:14] <twb> "a Chinaman" and "a Chinese" are both attested and both archaic.
[05:25:16] <kurahaupo> (Or maybe that's "french"; opinions differ on whether to capitalize adjectives that differ in form from the proper noun form.)
[05:25:31] <LjL> i assume Chinaman only sounds racist because at some point it started being used derogatorily and from then on it was taboo, though
[05:25:32] <Me-me> "Chinaman" is only considered racist because of historical context.
[05:25:46] <Me-me> It was, for at least a short time, the technically correc tterm.
[05:25:56] <CuriosTiger> twb: "a Chinese" runs into the same problem as "a French". Not necessarily wrong, but sounds awkward.
[05:26:09] <kurahaupo> CuriosTiger: "chinaman" is "racist" in that it's a product of a time when racism and bigotry were considered normal rather than things to be eschewed.
[05:26:13] <LjL> i guess especially these days with gender sensibilities, though, the -man -woman way is "problematic" anyway, and you'd still end up saying "French person", "Chinese person" etc in many cases
[05:26:19] <CuriosTiger> Me-me: Are there racist words that are inherently racist absent historical context?
[05:26:25] <twb> CuriosTiger: it's definitely used in early thrillers
[05:26:55] <LjL> CuriosTiger, i'm not a native speakers so my two cents are more like one and a half, but to me "a Chinese" and "a French" just sound that very high degree of odd that some people might call "wrong"
[05:26:58] <kurahaupo> CuriosTiger: I doubt it
[05:27:04] <CuriosTiger> twb: Yes, some old literature has expressions we'd consider socially unacceptable today, even when not used in a derogatory way.
[05:27:27] <xx> haven't you all heard? Everything is racist.
[05:27:37] <CuriosTiger> kurahaupo: I doubt it too, but I didn't want to declare that as a fact.
[05:27:46] <kurahaupo> LjL: I keep forgetting that you're not a native speaker. I dub thee an honorary native.
[05:27:53] <twb> LjL: coming at it completely cold, the modern sensibility is to either refer to nationality ("a Chinese citizen") or to ethnicity ("a Han / Uyghur / ...")
[05:27:56] <LjL> kurahaupo, :P
[05:28:22] <LjL> "a Han Chinese" is what i'd say / expect to hear. "a Han" is kinda weird...
[05:28:40] <LjL> (also interestingly while "a Chinese" is weird, "a Han Chinese" is somehow not...)
[05:28:40] <twb> ah that might be a politicized example
[05:29:04] <twb> But I wouldn't say "a Khmer Vietnamese" unless it was essential to specify BOTH ethnicity and nationality.
[05:29:22] <LjL> it's not about politics, it just sounds odd
[05:29:25] <CuriosTiger> LjL: Both of them certainly make my ears perk up. But as twb pointed out, "a Chinese" is attested, and so is "a French". So at the very least, there was a time when those were considered correct.
[05:29:27] <LjL> (the "Han" thing)
[05:30:08] <CuriosTiger> twb: And indeed, "Han Chinese" is usually used when ethnicity matters -- often to point out that a person belongs to the majority, rather than one of the many minorities in China.
[05:30:21] <LjL> CuriosTiger, fair enough, i will admit that sometimes "a Chinese" has been said without "man", "woman", "person", "fellow", "chap", "dude", etc following, just like sometimes, "ity killed the" was left implied :P
[05:30:21] <twb> Personally I don't think "a Han" sounds particularly bad
[05:30:25] <CuriosTiger> LjL: For that matter, I'm not a native speaker either.
[05:30:26] <kurahaupo> The words for language, ethnicity, and citizenship are often intertwined, which makes it awkward when differentiation is necessary.
[05:30:55] <CuriosTiger> twb: I'm sure you can justify it grammatically, but I default to interpreting "Han" as an adjective and expecting a noun (usually "Chinese") to follow.
[05:30:59] <LjL> CuriosTiger, ah ja det husket jeg ikke
[05:31:04] <kurahaupo> We used to say "chairman", then "chairperson", but now just "chair"
[05:31:14] <CuriosTiger> but we still say ombudsman.
[05:31:25] <kurahaupo> We seem to have skipped "chinaperson"
[05:31:32] <twb> CuriosTiger: I think the old attestations which sound racist are from back when scientific racism was du jour and ethnicity as a concept wasn't fully developed
[05:31:38] <LjL> kurahaupo, a society where being called the wrong gender is less bad than being called a chair is kind of interesting
[05:31:43] <CuriosTiger> twb: It's more complicated than that
[05:32:02] <twb> CuriosTiger: i.e. the writer didn't know or didn't care that about plurality in far-away places
[05:32:23] <CuriosTiger> twb: There's any number of words that started out innocuous or simply descriptive, then became slurs, then became appropriated by those they were directed against, then became taboo.

[05:35:52] <LjL> CuriosTiger, they solved that in American by calling everyone Something-American
[05:36:03] <LjL> where by "solved" i mean, again, "something"
[05:36:10] <CuriosTiger> LjL: Right. I'm Norwegian-American. But I don't feel that different from when I was only Norwegian.
[05:36:32] <twb> Well citizenship is just taxes and stuff.
[05:36:44] <CuriosTiger> twb: It's more than that, too.
[05:36:56] <LjL> CuriosTiger, how do people around you identify you? because in my opinion, no matter how much we like to stomp our feet and demand otherwise, that's the bottom line
[05:36:58] <CuriosTiger> There's personal pride in obtaining citizenship
[05:37:04] <twb> It doesn't (or shouldn't) affect what language you use at home, what foods are taboo, how you dance, &c
[05:37:22] <xx> taboo foods?
[05:37:26] <CuriosTiger> LjL: I've gotten all three. Norwegian, American, Norwegian-American.
[05:37:27] <kurahaupo> CuriosTiger: I guess Monty Python's "Norwegian Blue" parrot is equally weird to both Americans and Norwegians.
[05:37:42] <CuriosTiger> kurahaupo: Yes, but that's because Monty Python is just awesome.
[05:37:53] <CuriosTiger> twb: I'm not sure I agree.

[05:38:21] <twb> CuriosTiger: I will concede it's not black-and-white
[05:38:30] <LjL> CuriosTiger, then you're probably all three :) like, i was discussing this sort of issue a while ago with someone and the subject of a Japanese(?) fellow i knew in university came up. he came to Italy when he was around 12 i believe, during middle school anyway, and his own university friends i made friends with used to be his middle school classmates
[05:38:41] <CuriosTiger> twb: For example, I don't support a requirement to force me to speak English at home, but I think it would be ridiculous for me to expect government services in Norwegian.
[05:38:59] <twb> CuriosTiger: that's how it works in Australia
[05:39:06] <CuriosTiger> twb: I do remember finding it peculiar when I went for my driving test in California and was offered the written test in a ridiculous number of languages.
[05:39:06] <kurahaupo> I would gladly take up eating mosquitoes, to return the favour of them trying to eat me, but they're hard to catch in sufficient quantity to sustain me, and the neighbours objected to my mass breeding program.
[05:39:16] <twb> CuriosTiger: e.g. we provide covid posters in Italian and Dari
[05:39:37] <twb> CuriosTiger: and especially for voting they provide a lot of help with that in your language
[05:39:41] <LjL> CuriosTiger, he was shy and fretting, and so was i. i remember one day i was roaming around the campus wondering where the *hell* my classroom was, and i met him, and it went like "hi" "hey" "what are you doing?" "oh i'm looking for the classroom for X course" "oh, me too actually" "oh. well... see you around" "yeah, see you"
[05:39:49] <CuriosTiger> twb: Here, the three languages of most official communication are English, Spanish and (to a lesser extent) Haitian Creole.
[05:40:11] <twb> CuriosTiger: having said that, SPECIFIC content might be lacking in a specific language bceause it's "best effort" rather than a guarantee
[05:40:17] <CuriosTiger> twb: Sure.
[05:40:21] <LjL> CuriosTiger, thinking back, i found that whole interaction awfully Japanese. but, if we grant that *he* was Japanese, i definitely am not, and yet i was as much part of the awkward interaction as he was :P
[05:40:21] <CuriosTiger> twb: But I find my reaction odd.
[05:40:30] <twb> CuriosTiger: but it's not like "fuck you towelhead learn to speak american" or anything
[05:40:36] <CuriosTiger> twb: My reaction to Spanish is...well, lots of people down here speak Spanish, that seems useful to learn.
[05:41:00] <twb> CuriosTiger: AIUI if you walk into a store in Miami they will default to Spanish unless you look like a grumpy old white man
[05:41:03] <CuriosTiger> My reaction to Haitian kreole (a much smaller minority) is more along the lines of "why are we spending taxpayer money on these translations? They should learn English. Or Spanish."
[05:41:04] <LjL> and aside from that little anecdote, was he Japanese to me? obviously in a few ways, but was he also Italian in many ways that a random Japanese tourist just being here for a week on a couch isn't? hell yeah
[05:41:28] <CuriosTiger> twb: Eh, I'm a gringo. They'll generally greet me in English if they speak English.
[05:41:39] <CuriosTiger> But in places like Medley or Hialeah, they may not.
[05:41:40] <twb> CuriosTiger: yeah I don't know if you can get Australian election advice in Broome Pearl Diver kriol
[05:41:47] <LjL> and the person i was discussing this with eventually went "does it matter?" and it's a legitimate question, but i think the answer is... it either kinda does, or at least it's hard to not wonder
[05:42:06] <CuriosTiger> LjL: For me, it even changes with my mood.
[05:42:23] <CuriosTiger> LjL: After seeing the latest stunt from Florida Man, I'm not particularly eager to identify as either Floridian or American.
[05:42:40] <twb> CuriosTiger: there's about 50-80 languages explicitly listed in the voting pamphlet you get
[05:42:53] <CuriosTiger> OTOH, when I see Norway and the US disagree about some political question and I side with the US, I feel more American than Norwegian.
[05:43:04] <twb> CuriosTiger: the biggest minority language being Mandarin at around 3-5%.  So everything else is like 1 in 100 or 1000 people
[05:43:15] <CuriosTiger> twb: Yes. And...of course. Particularly from parties that cater to the immigrant vote, you'll get that.
[05:43:47] <twb> CuriosTiger: what political questions like "is universal healthcare an obvious no-brainer good thing?"
[05:43:50] <CuriosTiger> but lack of communication hinders integration.

[05:44:03] <twb> CuriosTiger: this isn't a party thing
[05:44:20] <twb> CuriosTiger: in australia, all elections are administered by a federal body which handles all logistics for everyone
[05:44:20] <CuriosTiger> twb: Political questions like "should every NATO member contribute a comparable amount of their GDP to common defense."
[05:44:40] <LjL> CuriosTiger, i've only tangentially even heard of Florida Man from others :P don't even know
[05:44:46] <CuriosTiger> twb: Political questions like "should we waste taxpayer money on extravagant political gestures with only symbolic meaning"?
[05:45:11] <twb> CuriosTiger: oh well I mean USA is a toy-heavy military so of course they contribute expensive toys.  Whereas India mostly contributes manpower.
[05:45:15] <kurahaupo> CuriosTiger: such as hosting the Olympics or a G-20 summit?
[05:45:28] <Me-me> I move to veto the heated political debate. Can I get a second?
[05:45:37] <twb> Me-me: yeah sorry
[05:45:57] <Me-me> We have a second. All in favour of vetoing the heated political debate?
[05:46:06] <CuriosTiger> kurahaupo: Such as subsidizing electric cars to the tune of tens of thousands for each car.
[05:46:26] <CuriosTiger> kurahaupo: Such as crushing perfectly good vehicles in the name of the environment.

[05:47:46] <LjL> i don't like to feel Italian but i am anyway

[05:59:02] <LjL> twb, if i had to grade it, i feel "strongly" Milanaese, "weakly" Lombard, and "moderately" Italian :P
[05:59:06] <LjL> Milanese*
[05:59:13] <LjL> but that grading is a bit silly
[05:59:14] <Me-me> Isn't Italian one of those heavily dialect-dependent languages?
[05:59:15] <twb> LjL: hahaha
[05:59:23] <LjL> obviously there's more than one layer to identity
[05:59:32] * kurahaupo writes "hic Campagnesi sunt" on her letterbox
[05:59:36] <Me-me> So some people might have a centuries old word in common usage, but then two hours down the road nobody believes it's even real.
[05:59:43] <LjL> Me-me, Italian is fairly dialect-dependent but that could mean an entirely different thing to you than it does to an Italian
[05:59:48] <twb> LjL: I only picked that example because "Roma" is overloaded :-)
[06:00:27] <twb> Oh, I'm dumb.  I thought Rome was in Campania but it's apparently in Lazio
[06:00:47] <twb> I guess I was thinking of Napoli
[06:00:51] <LjL> Me-me, "Italian" has a bunch of what we call accents as well as regional words, and you'd call of all that together "dialects". However, the actual term "dialects" in Italy is reserved for what are actually regional languages, completely distinct from Italian (except for also being Romance). on the English Wikipedia you're going to find an article titled something like "Regional languages of Italy", but on the Italian wikipedia it may be "Dialetti"
[06:01:34] <Me-me> Right. So my understanding is accurate, but I had the wrong semantics, is what you're saying.
[06:01:35] <twb> China does that too.
[06:01:36] <LjL> Me-me, it's a bit confusing, but short story, many Italians speak Italian as their first language, with some more or less heavy accent and regional vocabulary, but a few Italian also speak a distinct Romance language as their first language, but switch to Italian as needed (as well as code-switch)

[06:01:58] <LjL> Me-me, i'm not really evaluating your understanding, i'm just trying to explain how things stand because it's a bit complicated :P
[06:02:23] <LjL> twb, Rome is in Lazio because Lazio is Latium whence Latin
[06:02:40] <LjL> Naples is in Campania but the people of Campania are called Campani, not Campagnesi :P
[06:02:40] <twb> gotcha
[06:03:22] <LjL> i am in Milan which is in Lombardy where we got all that nasty COVID
[06:03:23] <twb> Ah yes I see I fucked up my orthography Campagna vs. Campania
[06:03:42] <LjL> twb, that's okay, that's a very italian thing to do, they sound more or less the same in most regular speech :P
[06:03:57] <LjL> but "campagna" is its own separate word that means either "campaign" or "countryside"
[06:04:08] <twb> In my brain I just went "it's bell-town, how to I spell that in Italian"
[06:04:17] <LjL> i think most italian wouldn't be able to tell whether someone is saying "campagna" or "Campania" though unless they were speaking very deliberately
[06:04:22] <LjL> lol
[06:04:40] <twb> except that's campana not campagna?
[06:04:53] <kurahaupo> LjL: Didn't Italy respond to the intial outbreak with a reverse quarantine: don't let any healthy people into the infected area, and send all the sick people home?

[06:05:35] <twb> I haven't studied Italian since primary school.  I guess my memory is pretty shit.
[06:06:46] <LjL> twb, but you'd be right, if you wanted to take "campana" and make it into "bell-land" (or bell-town), it would indeed turn into "campania"
[06:06:53] <CuriosTiger> I haven't studied Italian ever. But I found out that I can ask simple questions in Spanish and Italians will understand me.
[06:06:54] <LjL> (although i don't believe that's where the name came from!)
[06:06:57] <kurahaupo> I was a little surprised to discover that I had inadvertently learned a hundred or so Italian words, through a combination of learning classic music, and dealing with the local pizzeria whose proprietor had a tenuous grasp of English.
[06:07:06] <twb> LjL: cool
[06:07:11] <CuriosTiger> Then they'll assault me with responses I don't understand, although I have learned a lot more Spanish since my last trip to Italy.
[06:07:19] <LjL> CuriosTiger, just don't talk about oil and vinegar because it all gets pretty confusing with false friends
[06:07:44] <twb> I get confused A LOT because I did italian, then french, then spanish
[06:07:48] <CuriosTiger> I know oil in Spanish is aceite, which is a false friend with English acid.
[06:07:49] <LjL> Spanish can go from crystal-clear to completely unintelligible for me depending on the specifics
[06:07:54] <twb> and they are close enough I select wrong in my brain
[06:07:59] <CuriosTiger> I don't know how to say vinegar.
[06:08:05] <LjL> CuriosTiger, and a false friend with italian aceto, which means vinegar
[06:08:09] <CuriosTiger> hah
[06:08:13] <kurahaupo> CuriosTiger: it's a true friend of "acetic (acid)"
[06:08:20] <twb> LjL: well we have "acetic acid" in English
[06:08:29] <LjL> kurahaupo, isn't acid also from that etym anyway?
[06:08:30] <CuriosTiger> also, I was very confused at fuel pumps in Spain
[06:08:32] <CuriosTiger> I couldn't find diesel
[06:08:42] <CuriosTiger> come to find out that gasolio doesn't mean gas, it means diesel.
[06:08:49] <LjL> that's the same in Italy
[06:08:53] <LjL> although we also just say diesel
[06:08:58] <CuriosTiger> Sorry, that *WAS* Italy.
[06:08:59] <twb> CuriosTiger: so they have "petrol" and "gasolio" ?
[06:09:01] <CuriosTiger> I said the wrong thing.
[06:09:07] <kurahaupo> CuriosTiger: "diesel" is the name of the inventor of the engine, not the name of the fuel that goes in it, despite what the servo's around here sell
[06:09:15] <CuriosTiger> twb: I think gas was "benzina" or some such
[06:09:17] <CuriosTiger> I forget.
[06:09:20] <twb> CuriosTiger: ah benzene
[06:09:24] <twb> CuriosTiger: that rings a bell
[06:09:37] <LjL> well, it's pretty common here to ask "benzina o diesel?" when refueling, but i suppose you could interpret that as asking about your car, not the fuel
[06:09:45] <CuriosTiger> kurahaupo: Yes, Rudolf Diesel. I've read a fair amount about him.
[06:09:46] <kurahaupo> Benzine is one of the hydrocarbons that can power a diesel engine
[06:09:49] <LjL> (benzina is petrol)
[06:10:13] <CuriosTiger> LjL: I wound up having to ask after pulling into several gas stations and not seeing "diesel".
[06:10:25] <CuriosTiger> kurahaupo: Benzene is.
[06:10:32] <LjL> CuriosTiger, probably a wise choice since people who've put the wrong thing into their cars haven't been happy with the results
[06:10:35] <twb> kurahaupo: IIRC what in English is "petrol or diesel" is asking about the ratio of different octanes, "diesel" taking heavier octanes (i.e. less distilled)
[06:10:52] <CuriosTiger> kurahaupo: But many European languages that AREN'T English have used a derivative of that particular hydrocarbon as the name of the motor fuel consisting of shorter hydrocarbon chains.
[06:11:10] <kurahaupo> CuriosTiger: that's specifically C6H6; benzine is an informal collection of chemicals that includes benzene
[06:11:27] <twb> It would feel a bit weird to go to a fuelling station and ask "Carnot of Volta?"
[06:11:27] <CuriosTiger> twb: The primary difference between gasoline and diesel is indeed the average length of the hydrocarbon chains.
[06:11:28] <LjL> CuriosTiger, so back onto the Spanish false friends, i really have no idea whether gasolina ends up being petrol or diesel fuel
[06:11:40] <CuriosTiger> there are others, like octane vs cetane ratings, aromatics, sulfur content etc.
[06:11:52] <CuriosTiger> kurahaupo: Ah.
[06:12:02] <kurahaupo> Does anywhere still sell fuel with added Pb?
[06:12:12] <twb> The best false friend in English/Spanish is "embarrassed"
[06:12:17] <CuriosTiger> LjL: In Mexico, Gasolína is gasoline. Probably from American influence.
[06:12:22] <CuriosTiger> I don't know what SPain calls it.
[06:12:29] <LjL> kurahaupo, during the time where both were common we'd ask for either "rossa" (red fuel, with the additions) or "verde" (green fuel, without)
[06:12:43] <CuriosTiger> Diesel is generally called "diesel" in most languages, including Spanish, but obviously excluding Italian. :)
[06:12:44] <kurahaupo> A weird false friend in English/French is "demand"
[06:12:58] <CuriosTiger> My favorite English/Spanish one is embarassed/embarazada
[06:13:06] <CuriosTiger> *embarrassed
[06:13:13] <CuriosTiger> embarazada means pregnant. :)
[06:13:25] <kurahaupo> that's *definitely* embarrasing
[06:13:26] <LjL> CuriosTiger, interesting, "benzina" is valid in Catalan and Portuguese according to Wiktionary but not in Spanish
[06:13:26] *** Quits: Isthmusi (~Isthmus@user/isveni) (Quit: leaving)
[06:13:29] <kurahaupo> *ssing
[06:13:49] <LjL> but in Catalan it says gasolina is a synonym so presumably it's safe to call it gasolina in the Spanish-speaking world
[06:13:59] <twb> Wikipedia has changed its image
[06:14:00] <kurahaupo> I seem to recall that "uova" is a false friend between Spanish and Portugese
[06:14:18] <CuriosTiger> LjL: Also Benzin in German, Bensin in the Scandinavian languages, Benzin in several Slavic ones including Russian (бензин) etc.
[06:14:20] <twb> It used to have a Dutch advertising poster saying "Mama, die, die, die!"
[06:14:46] <LjL> kurahaupo, "uova" is eggs in Italian, it doesn't sound either Spanish or Portuguese to me
[06:14:58] <CuriosTiger> huevo in Spanish.
[06:15:05] <kurahaupo> "grape" vs "egg"
[06:15:11] <CuriosTiger> which does look like a cognate of uova, particularly since the h i silent
[06:15:22] <CuriosTiger> grape is uva
[06:15:37] <LjL> CuriosTiger, yes "huevo" would be easy for me to guess
[06:15:49] <CuriosTiger> and given the similar shape, it wouldn't surprise me if one word is derived from the other.
[06:15:55] <LjL> ah, uva and huevo may be confusable i guess
[06:16:03] <LjL> but i wouldn't personally be struck by them as false friends
[06:16:11] <CuriosTiger> I wouldn't either.
[06:16:18] <LjL> i know some of the underlying phonetics... Spanish "ue" tends to be Italian "uo"
[06:16:22] <kurahaupo> I got that story from my father, who was learned to get by in several romance languages by learning to speak rather than write, so I can't vouch for the spelling
[06:16:30] <kurahaupo> (And sadly I can't ask him now.)
[06:16:35] <LjL> the spelling is correct
[06:16:45] <LjL> but it may feel different to someone who isn't native in *either* language
[06:17:02] <CuriosTiger> I'm not native in either language
[06:17:03] <LjL> they may be easily confused for them while for an italian they are recognizably similar but not deceptively confusing
[06:17:04] <LjL> possibly
[06:17:17] <CuriosTiger> but I'm approaching 1000 days of Duolingo Spanish lessons
[06:17:34] <kurahaupo> CuriosTiger: only 9000 days to go to be an expert
[06:17:38] <LjL> CuriosTiger, upon learning i knew some Swedish, a Norwegian once attempted to tell me "ta de lungt" and had to repeat it like ten times and i had no idea what he was saying :P
[06:17:41] <CuriosTiger> and I am doing other things, like watching Spanish-language TV shows, listening to podcasts, and trying to find some easy literature in Spanish.
[06:18:14] <CuriosTiger> LjL: At least he told you "lugnt" instead of the Norwegian equivalent "rolig"
[06:18:40] <CuriosTiger> ("rolig" is a false friend between Norwegian and Swedish. It means "calm" in Norwegian, but "funny" in Swedish.)
[06:19:59] <CuriosTiger> The Norwegian word is cognate with German Ruhe + suffix "lich". German doesn't use that noun with that suffix, but the Scandinavian languages do.
[06:24:19] <twb> Spanish literature is everywhere
[06:25:15] <twb> https://www.gutenberg.org/files/15353/15353-h/15353-h.htm  is for kids
[06:26:00] <twb> I was reading one of those and the guy had a "pluma" and I was stuck wondering what the hell this feather was for
[06:26:09] <twb> Eventually I realized they meant a quill
[06:27:04] <twb> I think this is the one I was reading last: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/22065/22065-h/22065-h.htm
[06:30:54] <LjL> CuriosTiger, yeah i knew about that one. he certainly was trying to speak Swedish, but all my swedish was from songs and i didn't even know the actual expression "ta det lugnt" nevermind the slurred Norwegian rendition of it :P

[06:54:43] <LuisR14> o.o
[06:54:43] <LjL> CuriosTiger, the Italian is weird how she keeps using "capisco", because that's not idiomatic to me, it's very much... something I'd expect from an ESL of Italian (which she clearly isn't, to be clear, i'm just perplexed). because i'd say "ho capito", as in "I've understood", rather than "I've understand", almost in every circumstance when I want to indicate I've understood
[06:57:08] <LjL> heh, when the Italian girl says she finds Portuguese difficult, the guy goes "ok then we need a French person here"
[06:57:37] <LjL> but to be honest despite Portuguese looking much close to Italian *when written*, I find it reeeeally undecipherable when spoken normally, even more so than French
[06:59:16] <CuriosTiger> LjL: Could be a difference between your dialetti? :)

[07:00:21] <CuriosTiger> In one of the words, the Italian word "regina" became "rainha" in Portuguese -- but it's pronounced "heina".

[07:00:53] <CuriosTiger> like, the H goes away, the R becomes an H, and in the process it changes the vowel? What?
[07:01:52] <CuriosTiger> Wel,l 10:30 and I have a small painting project in the garage.
[07:01:54] <CuriosTiger> so bbiab.
[07:01:57] <LjL> CuriosTiger, the h doesn't go away, "nh" is a digraph that corresponds to spanish ñ and italian gn
[07:02:42] <LjL> Portuguese sure has a bunch of strange R sounds

[07:19:01] <LuisR14> R that becomes aspirated-like
[07:22:07] <twb> LjL: is "capisco" maybe a Sicilian thing?  I've seen it in American mafia movies
[07:22:44] <twb> "Listo" (as an imperative) in Spanish confused me when I first encountered it.
[07:22:51] <twb> I think I was mainly exposed to Chilean Spanish
[07:23:13] <LjL> twb, i don't know, it's correct italian, it just doesn't seem idiomatic to me, i associate it a lot with foreigners learning Italian and trying to translate "I understand" literally, or for that matter, their teachers doing it that way
[07:23:23] <LjL> but CuriosTiger may be right it's a regional thing and they just use it that way elsewhere
[07:23:41] <LjL> sometimes I do believe we're (or speaking for myself, I am) quite uneducated on how other people in Italy speak
[07:24:13] <LjL> I certainly encounter things that are weird, like on eBay now I've gotten used to see it, but it still weirds me out, "lo scatolo" instead of "la scatola" for "the box"
[07:24:13] <twb> LjL: the other one that completely blew my mind
[07:24:32] <twb> LjL: I was reading Australian government warnings about covid in Italian, and it said "chiamare 000"
[07:24:54] <twb> LjL: even though "mi chiamo" is literally the first thing they teach, they never mentioned you can use it for telephones
[07:25:22] <twb> And it's the same in Spanish; they tech "me llamo" but not that you can say "llama 000"
[07:25:29] <LjL> well you can use "chiamare", you can't use "mi chiamo" :P "chiamarsi" is kind of a different verb from "chiamare" (not really, but sort of)
[07:25:33] <twb> (000 is our 112 emergency number)
[07:25:53] <LjL> reflexive verbs in Italian and Spanish can have decently different meanings from their non-reflexive counterparts
[07:25:58] <twb> LjL: ah I am probably getting spelling wrong
[07:26:04] <LjL> no the spelling is right
[07:26:12] <LjL> but "MI chiamo" is, literally, "I call myself"
[07:26:18] <twb> Right
[07:26:20] <LjL> so the "mi" is not there when you're calling the number
[07:26:29] <twb> Oh yes I didn't explain that very well
[07:26:52] <twb> What I mean is, they taught us the reflexive usage "I call myself Trent", but never that you can use "in an emergency, call 000"
[07:27:18] <twb> Which is completely logical in English and Latin and Spanish and Italian, but just never mentioned in school
[07:27:25] <LjL> well, it's normal I guess, "what's your name?" and "my name is..." are common first-things to learn in foreign languages
[07:27:41] <LjL> although how to call an emergency number is arguably more important :P
[07:27:56] <twb> I'm not actually sure what verb they would have taught us for "to call/dial/telephone"
[07:28:16] <LjL> almost certainly still "chiamare", that's by far the most common
[07:28:20] <LjL> you can say "telefonare a", too
[07:28:28] <twb> Yeah that's what I was thinking
[07:28:35] <LjL> but you almost never say "telefona al 112", you say "chiama il 112"
[07:28:39] <LjL> you can say "telefona a tua madre"
[07:28:57] <twb> On the radio nowadays they give URL instead of telephone so I don't immediately know :-)
[07:29:09] <LjL> (but "chiama tua madre" is equally valid, except it is slightly ambiguous as it could mean yell at her, but like in English, it's generally understood from context :P)
[07:29:25] <twb> But yeah, when I saw that in the covid poster I thought they had used google translate :-)

[07:30:35] * LuisR14 marcare a la sua madre
[07:30:39] <LjL> I think the thing is that while the logic of "I call myself X" is easy to explain to an English speaker, still the idea of having something as your name *being* "calling yourself that" is alien to the way Germanic languages work. In English you just say "my name is..." but even in other Germanic language you have specific verbs for it, like "ich heisse...", "jag heter..."
[07:30:52] * LuisR14 hidez
[07:31:00] <LjL> so I guess it's natural to think that "chiamar(si)" must be specific to that, if that's what you're taught

[07:31:45] <LuisR14> :)
[07:31:58] <twb> LuisR14: "my name is X" is better than "I'm called X"
[07:32:02] <twb> er, LjL
[07:32:17] <twb> But yeah just the copula.  "I'm X.  This is Y."
[07:32:39] <LjL> twb, what i was saying is that the *logic* of "I call myself X" is easy to explain, not that that's actually something that gets said
[07:32:44] <LjL> so the logic is easy to explain but it's not ingrained
[07:32:48] <twb> right
[07:32:49] <LjL> LuisR14, you hypercorrected, btw
[07:33:16] <twb> Is "sono Alice" OK, unidiomatic, or plain wrong?
[07:33:23] <LjL> LuisR14, in Italian you generally use the article before mio/tuo/suo, but most family members are an exception. so it's always "mia madre" and never "la mia madre"
[07:33:30] <LjL> twb, it's fine
[07:33:46] <LjL> twb, if anything "Mi chiamo ..." sounds kind of childish in a few situations
[07:33:57] <LjL> (not necessarily, though)
[07:33:57] <twb> I'm pretty sure they yell at you in class if you try to do that, but it was... like 25 years ago

[07:37:37] <LuisR14> "baglia" ">
[07:37:45] <LuisR14> :>
[07:38:01] <LjL> yeah i guess sbagliare is not a very intuitive verb in Spanish
[07:38:08] <LjL> i don't even know the etymology
[07:38:19] <LjL> it's a very common verb though
[07:38:53] <LjL> From s- +‎ bagliare (see also abbagliare). See bagliore. → sees "bagliore"... → From Middle High German baidan. Related to or influenced by Catalan badar (“to gape, observe”) and French berlue (“distorted vision”).[1]
[07:39:10] <LjL> I think based on this, maybe nobody knows the etymology, or at least not an etymology that makes sense O.o
[07:40:42] <LuisR14> :/
[07:41:19] <LjL> twb, were you taught what to say on the phone for "hello"
[07:45:25] <twb> LjL: I think probably just "ciao"
[07:45:32] <LjL> twb, that's kinda wrong
[07:45:49] <LjL> you can say that after you've established communications, if it's someone you're on first-name terms with :P
[07:45:55] <LjL> but the thing to say is "pronto?"
[07:46:00] <LjL> and the answer is again "pronto."
[07:46:03] <twb> I know in Japanese you say "testing, testing" and when they answer you say "what?" in a rude register
[07:46:11] <LjL> O.o
[07:46:16] <LjL> in Japanese you say moshimoshi
[07:46:20] <twb> Because it is assumed that anyone who can afford a telephone muts be high status
[07:46:22] <LjL> is that testing?
[07:46:27] <twb> LjL: that means testing
[07:47:18] <LjL> what does it have to do with status though? the Italian "pronto?" is similar, you're literally asking if the other party is ready to talk, and it dates back to when talking on a phone meant putting on a headset and stuff
[07:47:34] <twb> LjL: in Japanese I mean
[07:47:59] <twb> LjL: instead of answering in formal or polite register, you use the "talking to inferior" register
[07:48:25] <twb> Because you, the telephone-haver, are a rich person, and the person calling is probably a switchboard operator – a poor person
[07:48:32] <LjL> i see
[07:48:43] <twb> although it's different for a company
[07:48:52] <LjL> so that's the answer to moshimoshi? because i heard the answer as being again moshimoshi
[07:49:11] <twb> If you answer a corporate phone it's more like "thank you for calling and also for everything great you might do for us, a lowly company"
[07:49:58] <twb> It's all tied to Japanese language having complicated registers AND on the telephone, you don't can't tell in advance from appearance which to use
[07:50:53] <LuisR14> o.o
[07:51:50] <LjL> also "sono <name>" in Italian is pretty much the standard thing to say after "pronto" on the phone
[07:52:21] <LjL> you'd not say "mi chiamo <name>" as that would be telling the other person what your name is, while what you're doing here is identifying yourself (the other person presumably already knows you)
[07:52:53] <LjL> "Pronto? Ciao, sono LjL. C'è twb?"

[18:10:19] <CuriosTiger> like with Scandinavian syllable stress, or with a pitch accent, or both?
[18:12:58] <pussipupu> like with the syllables divided where the apostrophe is, it's even etymologically "correct"!
