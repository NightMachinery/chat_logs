[03:39:41] <Work-BWMerlin> I have documentation about how to do things like "how to install x how to set y
[03:40:13] <Work-BWMerlin> But I don't think I am doing as good a job as could be done to document what overall settings are actually been set/configured
[03:40:17] <xe0n> so if there's specific things in an application that need to be configured i dedicate a page to it
[03:40:55] <xe0n> i.e. think if the application falls over or you need to rebuild, how can you get it back to the way it was
[03:41:05] <xe0n> so like you're not fumbling it for six months because something has been forgotten
[03:41:13] <xe0n> all key aspects of the application should be documented
[03:41:19] <xe0n> installing an application is like...one page
[03:41:23] <xe0n> the configuration and design is the rest
[03:41:26] <Work-BWMerlin> See what is what I don't have
[03:41:47] <Work-BWMerlin> Say for GLPI I have "how to add an option to a drop down menu" or something similar
[03:42:10] <Work-BWMerlin> But I don't then have required what all the options that are currently there recorded
[03:42:15] <xe0n> if you're configuring an application, all parts that need to be configured should be documented
[03:42:36] <xe0n> so you need to spend time going through it and saying "mmm if this was lost, would it cause issues? if so i should probably document this"
[03:44:58] <Work-BWMerlin> Would a table be sufficient do you believe like "drop down menu" and then list all the drop down menus in that table?
[03:47:25] <Work-BWMerlin> So you would have a document on how to set drop downs and then another which would contain what drop downs have been set
[04:00:06] <xe0n> document common things you would configure in the applications
[04:00:14] <xe0n> you just dont install stuff and its good to go, typically there's some configuration thats required
[04:00:17] <xe0n> document that config
[04:00:31] <xe0n> think of it as a design document
[04:00:42] <xe0n> i.e. you should be able to give that document to someone and they can configure the software for you

[04:22:16] <Work-BWMerlin> The web console session timeout, so I had to start again.  Part of the reason it timed out was because the domain is so large when I was filtering all the returned AD groups etc it would take a very long time to return results.

[04:58:55] <sd> 15<z​eroconf> implementation is more important than design. You are relying on the printer company to make a good PS driver

[05:01:26] <xe0n> just dont change for the sake of changing
[05:01:33] <xe0n> if you're using PCL and a specific driver version, use the same...
[05:01:48] <xe0n> you can look at changing it up later once you determine the benefits and the outcome

[08:30:08] <csws> what could possibly go wrong?
[08:30:11] <dragonfleas> what's wrong with that
[08:30:11] <xe0n> ++
[08:30:20] <dragonfleas> will everyone flood it
[08:30:20] * csws wonders if that was ironic or not
[08:30:28] <dragonfleas> XD
[08:30:30] <xe0n> not if you lock down the firewall to only accept dns requests from you
[08:30:44] <csws> https://www.cloudflare.com/en-au/learning/ddos/dns-amplification-ddos-attack/
[08:31:08] <csws> yeah I have dnscrypt-proxy set to only listen on LAN IPs
[08:31:10] <dragonfleas> i mean i have a static ip through provider so i could easily just allow all traffic to and from one ip boom ez
[08:31:16] *** Joins: riff-IRC (~riff-IRC@user/riff-irc)
[08:31:23] <csws> and the firewall doesn't have any any/any rule too so even if I goofed that up I should be ok
[08:31:55] <csws> so you'll send your DNS traffic out unencrypted to the cloud box?
[08:31:59] <xe0n> LOL
[08:32:17] <xe0n> 3.3.3.3
[08:32:17] <csws> spooks are rubbing their hands already lol
[08:32:31] <xe0n> monthly cost is probably more than the cost of a rpi
[08:32:32] <xe0n> lol
[08:32:48] <csws> or signing up to nextdns
[08:32:53] <csws> lol
[08:36:11] <csws> at least with nextdns etc. you get options for DoH, dnscrypt, etc.
[08:36:22] <csws> and you can do some fancy shit to uniquely identify devices for hte purposes of logging

[13:06:15] <teh_f4ll3n> they are currently on individual injectors
[13:06:26] <Oliber> do you want active or passive poe?
[13:07:59] <teh_f4ll3n> hmm... active I guess
[13:08:10] <Oliber> what model are the APs?
[13:08:17] <teh_f4ll3n> unifi
[13:08:23] <Oliber> oh my
[13:09:17] <teh_f4ll3n> I looked at unifi's own stuff 
[13:10:11] <Oliber> if they are active poe, then a cheap TP-link should be fine
[13:10:22] <teh_f4ll3n> all I really need is an unmanaged multiport injector that then gets plugged into a managed switch
[13:11:29] <Oliber> https://www.wifi-stock.co.uk/details/active-poe-injector.html
[13:11:36] <teh_f4ll3n> the controller is off-site so I don't really need fancy on-prem HW

[13:17:46] <csws> oh wait
[13:17:51] <csws> teh_f4ll3n, are these ubnt APs?
[13:17:53] <Oliber> csws: he dosn't want a switch - he wanted a multiport injector
[13:17:59] <csws> I thought they were generally passive poe
[13:18:12] <teh_f4ll3n> I'll double check
[13:18:58] <csws> god i'm confused now
[13:19:01] * csws goes to check the poe injector
[13:19:03] <Oliber> https://www.wifi-stock.co.uk/details/passive-gigabit-poe-injector-8-port.html - that is 5-57v @1A max
[13:19:24] <teh_f4ll3n> I know there are some of these on site https://eu.store.ui.com/collections/unifi-network-wireless/products/unifi-ac-mesh-pro-ap
[13:19:32] <Oliber> so should cover unifi gear, but i don't know much of such things
[13:19:59] <Oliber> "Power Method 802.3af PoE"

[13:21:20] <csws> yeah ok my shitty prosumer one is passive 24v

[17:38:15] <xe0n> Reinstalling the ESXi host is the only supported way to reset a password on ESXi. From ESXi 4.1 onwards, the host profile feature was introduced.
[17:38:16] <xe0n> If the host is managed by vCenter and is still connected, you can the reset by leveraging the host profile feature. For Host Profile feature you must have Enterprise Plus Licensing -  For more information refer to KB : Reset ESXi Root Password with Host Profile

[19:23:58] <AnonymooseReddtr> OLD job had something like 60+ vm's and 3 hosts

[19:27:36] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> to do standard, if all three are hosting the vms, you'd be licensing 48c to get to 6 vms (2 per host), and then to add more vms, you'd be relicensing the host again

[20:41:31] <signofzeta> 2008 R2 = AD Recycle Bin.  2016 = PIM

[23:31:28] <sintax> but 300 lines of ps will save you 20 minutes setting up crap
