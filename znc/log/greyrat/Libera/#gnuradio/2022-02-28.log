[17:15:26] <willcode4[m]> It depends on the rtlsdr library implementing `rtlsdr_set_bias_tee()`, and the Soapy RTLSDR cmake detecting that function at build time.

[17:21:01] <muaddib[m]> Ok, so I need to build from source and make sure soapyrtlâ€™s cmake picks up on that.
[17:26:40] <LordKalma> you need to first build / have a librtlsdr thhat has  `rtlsdr_set_bias_tee()`
[17:26:46] <LordKalma> then build soapy-rtlsdr from source
[17:26:59] <LordKalma> making sure it's picking that aforementioned librtlsdr

[18:35:52] <LordKalma> in fact, i encountered couple bugs, but I would need to revisit that work for re-find them
[18:37:19] <LordKalma> but iirc it was in the UHD module. The debugger - which was set to breakpoint on expections - always blocked the application when the library was loaded (I was using the C interface because I was using it via runtime loading / dllopen-ing, if you will)

[20:19:18] <ibrahf[m]> Hi everyone, Im new here. and also relatively new to using gnu radio. Im trying to build an oot module and was hoping I could get invited to the right rooms to ask questions
[20:20:19] <MarcinP[m]> ibrahf[m]: Hi, have you tried to make OOT with GNU Radio tutorials?
[20:21:56] <ibrahf[m]> yea i have but i didnt really find them too clear. Im basically trying to build a matrix multiplier and was wondering if how to store a global variable
[20:24:28] <funkylab[m]> ibrah.f: hi! you're in the right place, but a global variable seems to be the wrong tool here. (they're almost never the right tool!) You probably want a class member. But that's just C++ or Python (depending on which language you chose), and has not too much to do with GNU Radio :)
[20:28:21] <ibrahf[m]> funkylab[m]: oh okay that makes some sense. I am working in c++. I saw a few examples where they set up vector using a class, wasnt too sure if that was the route i had to take. Thanks you. I will try this

[23:17:00] <ibrahf[m]> <muaddib[m]> "Could you elaborate on how..." <- Sorry I logged off for a sec there. I am essentially trying to build a block to represent pre distortion in a power amplifier. The block requires only one input and produces one output, but I need the some parameters such as a few previous inputs which are stored in a vector( This models memory) and distortion coefficients. I was confused because I was trying to figure out how the parameters
[23:17:00] <ibrahf[m]> could be stored, which is why I assumed a global variable. I think funkylab provided how to go about this but I am not there yet. Most of it was quite clear, it was just that one area I had some confusion

[23:23:12] <funkylab[m]> cool!
[23:23:35] <ibrahf[m]> Also, another issue I'm having. What am I doing wrong if I have swig fully installed but I don't see a directory when I create a gr-howto
[23:23:42] <funkylab[m]> have you seen https://github.com/gnuradio/gr-dpd by the way? 
[23:24:00] <funkylab[m]> your version of GNU Radio might not depend on swig
[23:24:09] <funkylab[m]> which version of GNU Radio are you using?
[23:24:20] <ibrahf[m]> funkylab[m]: I most have not
[23:25:29] <funkylab[m]> it's cool; it was a Google summer of code project where a student sat down, implemented a couple "typical" amplifier models and some precompensation blocks :)
[23:25:52] <ibrahf[m]> this is pretty much what I'm looking for
[23:26:08] <ibrahf[m]> you just saved me a whole lot of hours of work
[23:26:15] <funkylab[m]> :D
[23:26:28] <funkylab[m]> power of open source and scientific collaboration! 
[23:26:38] <funkylab[m]> please build really cool stuff with this! 
[23:26:57] <ibrahf[m]> Thank you so much
[23:27:06] <ibrahf[m]> funkylab[m]: im on a mission now
[23:27:19] <funkylab[m]> you can't be stopped!
[23:29:45] <funkylab[m]> note that this module is still for GNU Radio 3.8
[23:30:07] <funkylab[m]> if you need it to work with GNU Radio 3.10: https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/GNU_Radio_3.10_OOT_Module_Porting_Guide
[23:30:26] *** Joins: ve7it (~LawrenceG@S0106f0f249afdb93.pk.shawcable.net)
[23:34:40] <ibrahf[m]> I have the 3.8
[23:35:28] <funkylab[m]> perfect, so no porting :)
[23:35:39] *** Quits: Elzington_ (~Elzington@87.249.134.10) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:36:11] *** Joins: Elzington (~Elzington@87.249.134.10)
[23:38:47] <funkylab[m]> but 3.8 means your GNU Radio is in fact using swig.
[23:39:09] <funkylab[m]> When you used `gr_modtool add` to add a new block, you should have gotten a file in swig/
[23:41:36] <ibrahf[m]> actually I am using 3.10
[23:41:43] <ibrahf[m]> which means I will have to port
[23:41:56] <ibrahf[m]> but this explains the swig issue
[23:42:55] <ibrahf[m]> I am trying to make my own version so I could just use it as a reference. its still very helpful
