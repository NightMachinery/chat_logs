[12:08:20] <Lumine> I once had a terrible argument on waking up with someone. And it ended with them saying that I don't know what I'm talking about at all. And I said they were right, because I don't know about it in practice. You can't make concrete statements about a domain of experience you have no access to. If you only know it in theory, you're liable to 'eat the menu instead of the dinner'.

[12:14:05] <plankster> urista had to urinate pretty bad i guess
[12:14:42] <Lumine> I'm aware of it being the outro of the movie, I've listened to it many times
[12:14:43] <arryana> that's so very g.g. allin

[12:15:24] <arryana> his shows were boring as hell if you were old enough not to be shocked by that sort of nonsense
[12:15:35] <arryana> actually, it was boring even when i was young.
[12:15:39] <plankster> and then whip out his small peepee and get it uncomfortably close to people
[12:15:58] <plankster> yeah but sometimes hed get actually violent
[12:16:02] <arryana> i went to one of his shows.  it was like watching the worm-eating kid on the playground
[12:16:27] <arryana> can't say i was impressed
[12:16:44] <plankster> i dont think he was trying to impress you lol

[12:36:43] <Lumine> I'm checking my facts first so I have the right numbers
[12:39:01] <Lumine> I can't find the article right now from wiki because I don't remember exactly the name of the article so I'm going to have to wing it from memory. Maybe somebody can correct me.
[12:39:41] <arryana> haha, ok
[12:41:43] <Lumine> A trip to the Andromeda galaxy from Earth, if travelling at the speed of light would take approximately 2.5 million years. However, if the ship we were on steadily accelerated towards it at Mach 2(?) speed, from our point of view the trip would take less than 40 years. Assuming that the acceleration never stops that is.
[12:42:49] <arryana> hm
[12:43:02] <arryana> i don't know enough about physics to say, but isn't there a limit to how fast something can move?
[12:44:17] <arryana> i mean, something can't accelerate too quickly or it just shakes apart, no?
[12:44:27] <Lumine> Well I don't know enough about physics either. I came across it when I was reading on hypothetical FTL technology
[12:45:26] <arryana> ah
[12:46:00] <arryana> i like the idea of flights of fancy, but i'm much more a fan of practical advancements, if that makes sense
[12:46:52] <arryana> there are a lot of serious fundamental problems right here that need to be solved before we go shooting off at light speed
[12:48:28] <arryana> i mean, what makes that sort of thing anything other than a vanity project like musk and mars?
[12:50:37] <Lumine> Well I agree, and yes that makes sense. For me I have to look for ideas for inspiration somewhere, so I read up on random stuff sometimes. Anyone's guess if that's practical or not. But it ends up on a canvas sooner or later.

[12:54:22] <arryana> space travel, to me, is still a case of 'wherever you go, there you are'
[12:54:30] <arryana> it seems like idealistic escapism to me
[12:58:59] <arryana> it would be easier for me to be enthused about if there was any concrete reason to believe we as a species wouldn't just go somewhere else and use it up.
[13:01:30] <pussipupu> I wouldn't mind both to be fair

[13:26:30] <arryana> when i was in high school my best friend's dad had a little sailboat.  he'd take us out on the lake from time to time.
[13:26:36] <pussipupu> I'm Yachtmaster qualified, though my commercial ticket expired
[13:26:42] <arryana> oh wow
[13:26:44] <pussipupu> but that's basically just a driving license equivalent
[13:26:56] <Thelma> I would really love to live or at least holiday and sleep on a sailboat one day. I know how to sail at least the smaller sailboats and cats but I have never sailed on a big sailboat.
[13:26:57] <arryana> still a lot more than i could do
[13:27:15] <krb> playing with snow can be fun
[13:27:21] <Thelma> I used to sail a lot when I was younger.
[13:27:30] <arryana> my great uncle had a yacht, he used to take us down from new york to florida
[13:27:32] <Thelma> Young adult
[13:27:34] <pussipupu> If you get the chance to sail one of the Challenge boats take it, Thelma
[13:27:35] <arryana> but that was powered
[13:27:38] <Thelma> That sounds nice arryana
[13:27:43] <pussipupu> Lovely creatures they are
[13:27:54] <Thelma> It seems maybe romantic to sail around with someone too.
[13:28:05] <pussipupu> My dad has a boat now but I've not seen him in a couple of years

[13:28:53] <Thelma> What are the Challenge boats?
[13:30:21] <pussipupu> They're 20m ish monohulls built to sail upwind around Antarctica
[13:30:34] <pussipupu> And they don't afeared of nothing
[13:31:17] <arryana> sadly, i don't really belong on boats.  i sink like a rock and sharks want to eat me
[13:31:37] <pussipupu> maybe they just want kisses

It's the same as a smart person realizing they have better things to do than try to be a grandmaster chess

[17:57:40] <audrey> this is what happens when politics devolves to "we're afraid we'll lose, so let's rig the system to make sure we're always in power"

[17:59:53] <kmh> audrey,  there is a difference though democrats primarily try to win by getting the population at large to vote whereas republicans try to win by keep people from voting or having votes discounted
[18:00:54] <audrey> It would be cool if you made all seats in the House at-large, instead of having individual districts. It's not like these guys can "represent" a district that encompasses 20 cities and look like a fragment of a computerized fractal.

[18:03:13] <kmh> audrey,  maybe thand the democrats are without doubt full of shysters
[18:03:45] <kmh> but that doesn't change what they are doing and who is actively the threat to democratic standards now

[20:38:55] <iryith> Everywhere I've lived in a foreign country you're allowed to vote in the municipal elections, just not the national elections
[20:40:50] <arryana> i think that's true here too
[20:41:52] <iryith> which...I'm ok with. Citizenship comes with other things like mandatory military service which I never had to participate in, so why should I have a say in the national governmental stage if I don't have to participate in all of the responsibilities of that system?
[20:42:13] <arryana> fair enough
[20:43:15] <pussipupu> I like to think I'd have declined mandatory military service if it'd been a thing
[20:43:58] <pussipupu> I'm voting tomorrow, but not yet able to vote in general elections
[20:44:50] <iryith> You don't have a choice in these systems
[20:45:11] <iryith> well, that's kind of not true, you can either do the military service or civil service
[20:45:22] <iryith> but the civil service is usually a longer stint
[20:45:50] <pussipupu> Or accept the punishment
[20:45:54] <pussipupu> Conscientious objection isn't cost free
[20:46:06] <iryith> I think in the countries I lived it would be jail
[20:46:44] <evolv> iryith, so you're saying nobody should be allowed to participate in a system if they fundamentally believe in non-violence?
[20:47:18] <iryith> no, that's why the civil service exists
[20:47:35] <evolv> "mandatory military service"
[20:47:54] <arryana> you're a better man than me.  i wanted to serve as a battle medic, but i didn't pass the physical
[20:47:57] <iryith> You can rephrase it to "mandatory national service" then
[20:47:57] <pussipupu> I don't know what it would be, and there wasn't national service where I grew up
[20:48:13] <pussipupu> So I'm very much talking hypothetically
[20:48:39] <pussipupu> When I get citizenship it won't come work mandatory service because I'm old
[20:48:59] <evolv> iryith, then that can be changed requiring any resident to do it. US also accepts non-citizens into the armed forces
[20:49:24] <evolv> these are all artificial boundaries
[20:49:41] <iryith> With rights comes responsibilities
[20:49:56] <evolv> permanently disabled citizens who cannot do any work wouldn't be able to do any national service, but still can vote
[20:50:07] <iryith> there are exceptions, sure
[20:50:11] <iryith> very low % though
[20:50:16] <evolv> then they aren't rights, they're privileges
[20:50:34] <evolv> which is the actual case, no denying that. They are privileges because the state is more powerful
[20:50:42] <iryith> yeah, I suppose you could phrase it that way, sure
[20:50:56] <evolv> in terms of ideological perspective, any appreciate stay in a state is an investment in the state
[20:51:16] <evolv> more importantly, the state should serve its residents
[20:51:20] <iryith> can you rephrase? I don't understand
[20:51:38] <evolv> there is no way to reside in a state without contributing something to it
[20:51:40] <iryith> well, the state and residents are in a symbiotic relationship. One doesn't exist without the other
[20:52:19] <evolv> and, again, these are all artificial
[20:52:22] <evolv> just constructs
[20:53:20] <iryith> everything in life can be distilled down to an artificial construct
[20:53:28] <iryith> "we live in a society" isn't a condemnation of anything useful
[20:56:37] <audrey> It would be nice if I could give up the right to vote (which I never exercise, as a matter of principle) in exchange for reduced taxation or other government-imposed burdens.
[20:56:59] <audrey> Of course, trying to generalize that into some kind of policy comes with its own problems.
[20:57:56] * arryana artificially constructs a cup of tea
[20:58:58] <evolv> iryith, if we live in a society, then all members in that society should have a voice

[21:00:02] <evolv> audrey, that would be a huge loss of government revenue given the percentage who already don't vote :P
[21:00:54] <iryith> Everyone has a voice, it just depends on how "loud" it can be
[21:01:35] <evolv> and the bare minimum of direct voice is voting
[21:01:46] <iryith> you can vote in your local elections
[21:01:53] <iryith> that has a direct impact on your life
[21:02:08] <arryana> how would infrastructure like roads be maintained if that were an option, audrey?
[21:02:34] <arryana> not saying i disagree
[21:02:42] <arryana> but i'm not sure how it would work without systemic collapse
[21:02:54] <evolv> if you're a non-citizen, your city nor your state can prevent you from being deported by a swift change of immigration policy
[21:03:22] <iryith> sure. I'm fully aware that I can be deported at any time
[21:04:07] <iryith> but I follow the rules and in time if/when I become a citizen I will be able to participate fully in the system and not have to worry about that
[21:06:42] <evolv> following the rules doesn't really matter if suddenly your president decides to starve its Immigration Services and your application for continued residency gets delayed beyond expiration without an extension
[21:07:11] <iryith> Then I move
[21:07:31] <evolv> glad you have the money for that

[21:09:08] <iryith> get a job, have the right expectations and work your way up
[21:14:43] <audrey> arryana, well you wouldn't start by cutting infrastructure, you'd start by cutting other expenses
[21:15:38] <audrey> IDK, I think the immigration debate centers a lot around whether you think immigration to the US is a right or a privilege
[21:15:49] * pussipupu artificially constructs a cocktail
[21:16:00] <audrey> (or other Western countries)
[21:17:20] <iryith> Immigration anywhere is a privilege
[21:18:26] <audrey> the US federal budget is obscenely bloated and infrastructure is way down the list of things that have bloat in them
[21:18:36] <pussipupu> I'd worry it would lead to further disenfranchising people struggling financially
[21:19:18] <pussipupu> that and I tend to see voting as more a responsibility, so I wouldn't reward not voting
[21:19:48] <pussipupu> (so both right and responsibility and either way pressures against are harmful)
[21:20:06] <audrey> Well, in many parts of the US, the jury duty pools are taken from the list of voter records. So if you have never registered to vote, then you have a much lower chance of being selected.
[21:20:31] <audrey> I'm ideologically opposed to lay juries, so this makes sense for me, though I suspect most people would disagree, lol.
[21:21:17] <audrey> (This also has interesting implications for the kinds of people who are filtered to serve on juries - what does it say about a jury if you are only choosing people who are civically active?)
[21:22:31] <pussipupu> Interestingly no jury trial here
[21:23:01] <pussipupu> Though there's still the option of voting and being a conscientious objector to jury duty

[21:27:45] <iryith> oh, no bot for that
[21:27:45] <pussipupu> Also I don't think there's any registering to vote, but you have to register your residence
[21:28:08] <iryith> usually you do both
[21:28:22] <iryith> you have to register your residence and then when you register to vote it's only restricted to your district
[21:28:25] <audrey> iryith, a lay jury is a jury comprising members of the general public, as opposed to professional jurors or judges
[21:28:34] <iryith> ah, ok, thanks
[21:28:39] <pussipupu> A jury selected from the people at large rather than from a specifically qualified group
[21:29:00] <iryith> goddamn, I even spelled it wrong. My head isn't on right
[21:29:14] <pussipupu> here you don't register to vote, in the motherland you don't have to register your place of residence(though you often end up having to de facto)

[21:31:34] <iryith> ah ha, ok

[21:36:41] <pussipupu> it's de jure obligatorii but with quite small fine
[21:45:42] <Atque> audrey: Yeah, it's mandatory in every state and territory, since the early 20th century. It was because of very low participation rates following federation.

[21:54:57] <Atque> audrey: Yeah, it probably increases the size of the disengaged vote... people with little care or interest voting for someone random. That's probably not good, but there's no real local effort to change it.
[21:55:50] *** Joins: chiselfuse (~chiselfus@user/chiselfuse)
[21:58:03] <inhahe_> i'd rather a lot of disengaged votes than only people who care a lot, because those most passionate, with the most conviction, are usually the most wrongheaded, i think
[21:58:11] <audrey> I'd take the fine.
[21:58:25] <Atque> audrey: It's a $180
[21:58:56] <Atque> audrey: That's like idk... four months of phone service or 150 litres of petrol.
[21:58:58] <audrey> Given how weak the Australian dollar is right now, that's fine. :x
[21:59:26] <Atque> audrey: It's about 0.72USD, which is about normal.

[22:00:13] <Atque> It got very high during quantitative easing under Obama against the USD, but the USD used to be worth ~two AUD, so 0.72USD for one AUD is not that low imo.
[22:00:50] <Atque> audrey: Yeah, the US (well Texas) probably just bans people from feeding you if you line up to vote for four hours. : P
[22:01:15] <pussipupu> Ah sorry I thought it was like twenty quid
[22:01:16] <audrey> I don't live in Texas.
[22:02:34] <Atque> audrey: Yeah. US varies loads state-by-state tbh. Australia does a bit, but much less... more uniform between the states and territories.

[22:14:04] <Atque> audrey: What do you reckon would happen to political representation in the US if everyone was forced to vote... more people from some party in Congress?
[22:14:36] <audrey> I couldn't say.
[22:15:56] <inhahe_> I think it'd be more Democrats
[22:16:17] <Atque> In Australia, they reckon it would cause fewer older and conservative people to vote, compared to younger people and non-conservatives.

[22:20:04] <iryith> I think y'all need more than 2 parties
[22:22:35] <pussipupu> That's partly down to voting systems
[22:23:05] <pussipupu> The UK needs root and branch constitutional reform to be fair
[22:23:24] <Atque> iryith: There are any countries where more than 2 parties rotate through government?
[22:23:49] <Atque> (government as in the executive powers... department secretaries, ministers, president etc.)
[22:23:56] <iryith> At least Austria kind of does
[22:23:58] <iryith> Norway
[22:23:58] <Atque> pussipupu: What kind of reforms?
[22:26:36] <pussipupu> Removing monarchy and theocracy, a vaguely sensible electoral system, ditching the Lords Temporal as well as Spiritual (possibly in favour of another second chamber possibly to become unicameral)
[22:26:56] <pussipupu> that's what springs to mind in my slightly tipsy state at least
[22:27:13] <Atque> iryith: That's interesting. Norway has a unicameral parliament. New Zealand does too, and it is more pluralistic than two-party.

[22:28:57] <pussipupu> I'm not sure how you got there from what I said...
[22:29:38] <pussipupu> I think electoral system is more important than number of chambers for pluralism
[22:29:43] <Atque> pussipupu: Yeah, the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms should remove formal regnal powers I think. The Queen and her vice-regal governors still provide royal asset and so forward. Legally, they retain a veto power, similar to the president of the United States. It is never exercised by custom, but the formal power should be removed in my opinion. The same goes for the other remnants, it would be best to move them to the prime ministers,
[22:29:43] <Atque>  premieres etc.
[22:29:58] <iryith> Things like theocracy even if it isn't explicit is always going to have a role in any government

[22:30:23] <iryith> I should say religious influence rather than theocracy
[22:30:53] <pussipupu> I'm talking about de jure theocracy
[22:31:03] <pussipupu> the Lords Spiritual
[22:31:08] <iryith> ah ok
[22:31:58] <Atque> pussipupu: The House of Lords have not had a veto power since the Parliament Act(s). Hereditary peers most left following Blair's reforms. The Lords Spiritual mostly left after the abolition of the monasteries. It stands more as a useless chamber I think, than an actual seat of political power for bishops, aristocrats etc.
[22:33:32] <pussipupu> It still has power even without the veto
[22:33:57] <pussipupu> including being a way of giving ministerial posts to people not elected
[22:34:08] <Atque> pussipupu: There is an established church in England and Wales (Anglican church) and Scotland (Methodist I think). These are ceremonial though. People in Britain are not forced to go to these churches.
[22:35:34] <pussipupu> People aren't forced to go to church of course, but the LS still sit in parliament which was my objection
[22:35:37] <Atque> pussipupu: Plenty of public posts are given to people who are not elected (civil servants, senior bureaucrats etc.). They're given to these people because of their expertise. The same goes in the US etc.
[22:35:48] <pussipupu> Though I'm not a fan of established churches either
[22:36:07] <Atque> pussipupu: What practical powers does the house of lords have?
[22:37:40] <pussipupu> including but not limited to repeated review which can effectively block legislation
[22:37:51] <pussipupu> I'm not sure what your other point is though

[22:42:34] <Atque> pussipupu: They can't filibuster legislation because the Parliament Act 1949 limits the suspensory veto to one year and two sessions. It could be use to abolish the suspensory veto altogether.
[22:43:27] <Atque> pussipupu: So, it is not politically viable for the House of Lords to suspend most legislation even (unless they think an election is going to be lost or similar), because the House of Commons has a constant nuclear option.

[22:46:31] <pussipupu> It's that and worse, but let's drop this
[22:46:58] <iryith> I'm starting a cult for that exact reason. We can buy an island. You in?
[22:47:12] <Atque> iryith: Will it reduce my tax bill?
[22:47:41] <iryith> yes, but there's a larger personal physical penance
[22:47:46] <iryith> PPP, as it will be called
[22:49:16] <Atque> I'd be in if the personal physical penance reduce my overall taxes by more than the amount the penance costs.
