[15:38:08] <structoha> oh without echo
[15:38:10] <structoha> am so stupid
[15:38:24] <lgc> execute 'highlight EndOfBuffer ctermfg=' . synIDattr(synIDtrans(hlID('Normal')), 'bg', 'cterm')
[15:38:35] <lgc> might need to replace 'bg' with 'fg', not sure
[15:39:05] <lgc> also, it depends if you're in the GUI, and/or if you set 'termguicolors'
[15:39:18] <lgc> in which case, replace 'cterm' with 'gui'
[15:40:03] <lopid> might be easier to put a piece of paper over that part of the screen so you don't see those characters
[15:40:27] <structoha> that execution line is not working 
[15:41:05] <lgc> not working how?
[15:41:10] <structoha> :highlight EndOfBuffer ctermfg=synIDattr(synIDtrans(hlID('Normal')), 'ctermbg') --> color or number not recognized
[15:41:18] <lgc> you need :execute
[15:41:34] <lgc> :highlight doesn't evaluate its arguments
[15:41:38] <lgc> :execute does
[15:42:39] <structoha> missing argument 
[15:43:10] <structoha> :execute 'highlight EndOfBuffer ctermfg=' . synIDattr(synIDtrans(hlID('Normal')), 'ctermbg')
[15:43:59] <lgc> replace 'ctermbg' with 'bg'
[15:44:16] <lgc> and pass 'cterm' as a third optional argument if you want
[15:46:31] <structoha> works but seems to be another color, probably guibg 
[15:47:37] <lgc> run :highlight, look for a highlight group from which you want to borrow a color
[15:47:55] <lgc> replace 'Normal' with the name of that group
[15:48:43] <lgc> might also need to replace 'bg' with 'fg' (and/or 'cterm' with 'gui' if you use the 3rd optional argument)

[20:43:38] <mehwork> so it's something to do with Dispatch
[20:44:45] <romainl> it's really interactive vs non-interactive
[20:45:04] <mehwork> so i'm better off just running it on the cli?
