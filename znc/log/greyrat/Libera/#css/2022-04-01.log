[05:57:35] <jargon> https://www.google.com/search?q=react
[06:46:29] <FunkyBob> jargon: it's a javascript framework for building interactive web interfaces
[06:48:38] <FunkyBob> jargon: part of it is jsx, which lets you write xml-ish syntax directly in your javascript...it's what you saw earlier with mexijoe writing "<Navbar.Brand2 href="/"> Credit Score </Navbar.Brand2>"
[06:49:33] <FunkyBob> that's really a wrapper to React.createElement(Navbar.Brand2, { href: '/' }, 'Credit Score')
[06:59:24] <jargon> Ok.
[07:00:20] <jargon> FunkyBob, how do I make two columns? http://puzzlum.org/repo/?prj=Asterlife+v3&sect=mostrecent

[07:02:58] <FunkyBob> oh dear... you're back to the absolute positioning...
[07:03:06] <jargon> Fixed it.

[07:11:01] <FunkyBob> there wasn't much effort for you to implement them

[07:13:39] <FunkyBob> which is why I keep pressing you to _understand_ ...
[07:13:59] <FunkyBob> and I doubt you're trying much, because you rarely ask many questions about the solutions we provide.
[07:19:05] <jargon> FunkyBob, I am on memory suppressant meds for night terror and flash backs.,
[07:20:08] <FunkyBob> and that stops you from trying to learn and understand?
[07:20:57] <jargon> https://jsfiddle.net/gzfesd5q/
[07:21:03] <jargon> Did you make this one?
[07:21:21] <FunkyBob> looks familiar
[07:21:35] <jargon> It looks like it was modified.
[07:22:11] <jargon> I no longer use the green circles with arrows in them. I now use green oil pipes.
[07:22:15] <FunkyBob> from memory, I took your page, replaced the table nav with a list... and added the styling so it would sit right and the main content would wrap it
[07:22:25] <FunkyBob> ok
[07:22:33] <jargon> What part wraps it?
[07:23:05] <FunkyBob> by making the nav block 'float', it lets the other content flow around it
[07:23:06] <jargon> I only need the main page to wrap.
[07:23:58] <FunkyBob> so you said
[07:25:27] <FunkyBob> switching between the two layouts can easily be handled by putting the right class on the body
[07:25:33] <FunkyBob> and keying the styles to that
[07:25:51] <jargon> http://puzzlum.org/repo/?prj=Asterlife%20v3&sect=main I have no idea what I accomplished here,
[07:26:30] <FunkyBob> seems like a lot of left over styles on the unneeded div inside the nav...
[07:26:47] <FunkyBob> and still absolute positioning on the unneeded  div wrapping the nav

[07:30:14] <FunkyBob> you added my floats... you didn't remove all your bullshit
[07:30:23] <FunkyBob> so yeah, it doesn't behave right
[07:32:49] <jargon> What should I remove?
[07:34:17] <jargon> I have two different .css files.

[07:55:02] <jargon> It still looks like a complete mess tho.
[07:55:13] <FunkyBob> why is every item in the nav in its own list?
[07:55:36] <FunkyBob> why are there empty list items after each one?
[07:56:13] <FunkyBob> if you keep expecting everything to snap into perfection as we progressively fix  your site.... you'll have no joy here
[07:57:04] <FunkyBob> also, you still have <body> set to the flex layout needed only for the non-wrapping version
[07:58:10] <FunkyBob> also it would all sit better if you had kept the <main> from that
[07:58:21] <FunkyBob> this is why I don't believe you try to _understand_ our solutions, just copy them
[07:59:33] <FunkyBob> jargon: you've mixed two layout solutions... why are you surprised it's a mess?

[08:01:01] <jargon> :<
[08:02:00] <FunkyBob> jargon: so.. time to pare back the two layouts to their essentials... compare... and make classes to affect them as appropriate
[08:02:14] <FunkyBob> they _are_ compatible... you _can_ swap between them with simply changing a class on body
[08:02:24] <FunkyBob> compatible, because they can work on the same basic HTML

[08:15:33] <jargon> FunkyBob, Am I done stripping away all the garbage code?
[08:19:15] <FunkyBob> looks like it...
[08:19:24] <FunkyBob> the layout is still broken because you took <main> away
[08:19:30] <FunkyBob> that goes back to 'not understanding'
[08:29:31] <jargon> How about now? :(
[08:29:55] <jargon> It still doesn’t wrap.
[08:30:08] <FunkyBob> no, because you still have the flex layout for full size columns
[08:30:17] <FunkyBob> otherwise, the html seems better structured now
[08:32:12] <jargon> I have no idea what I am doing. .__.
[08:32:36] <FunkyBob> which comes back to my point about slow down, and UNDERSTAND each thing
[08:32:57] <FunkyBob> instead of just copying it directly into your templates
[08:33:43] <FunkyBob> also, ASK MORE QUESTIONS
[08:33:45] <jargon> I don’t know what you meant by flex.
[08:34:35] <jargon> I am just glad it only takes 1 to 3 seconds to completely resynchronize my website.
[08:35:04] <FunkyBob> flex... using "display: flex" on body switches it to using flexbox layout rules
[08:35:25] <jargon> So what do I do with that?
[08:37:52] <jargon> http://puzzlum.org/repo/?prj=Mind%20Realm%2097b%20v0.0.7.0.0&sect=main I have some oil pipe issues.
[08:41:12] <jargon> FunkyBob?
[08:41:43] <FunkyBob> so (a) what did you change?  and why?
[08:41:49] <FunkyBob> and (b) what is "the oil pipe issue"?
[08:42:27] <FunkyBob> and when I ask "why"  I want you to explain what you thought the change would affect
[08:43:26] <jargon> I have no idea what I did, I just flipped back and forth commenting and uncommenting until it wrapped.
[08:44:09] <FunkyBob> so clearly, that is not the right way to approach this
[08:44:13] <jargon> :/
[08:44:16] <jargon> I agree,
[08:49:06] <jargon> Why does the text wrap around, but not the class=”notice” oil pipes?
[08:51:15] <FunkyBob> so that <div class="notice colossal"> ... really looks like it's supposed to mean it's a heading...
[08:52:42] <FunkyBob> it's been a long time since I used floats (because they're mostly obnoxious and a hack for layouts like this)
[08:53:08] <FunkyBob> so... it may be that they only effect text... and your "divs that really look like headings" ... aren't playing nice with it
[08:53:29] <jargon> That betteR?
[08:53:37] <FunkyBob> which?
[08:59:03] <jargon> FunkyBob, I just changed notice to h1 and h3.
[08:59:16] <jargon> And I got rid of “colossal”
[09:00:23] <FunkyBob> see, if it were me... I wouldn't go with the wrap... I'd have the nav section stay fixed, and scroll the content
[09:00:26] <FunkyBob> but that's me
[09:00:38] <jargon> How do I do that then?
[09:00:56] <jargon> I happen to like the wrap effect on the main page.
