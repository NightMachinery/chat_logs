[12:51:56] <sla[m]12> would i need to pay about the same as .com for .xyz in the 2nd year?, if so whats the point of getting xyz over com
[12:53:01] <Arya[m]> first year is 1 $
[12:53:16] <Arya[m]> and you are more likely to find a domain you like

[12:56:42] <sla[m]12> Arya[m]: fair enough

[18:17:37] <gtlsgamr> As you can see it is used to make index pages for different sections.. e.g. look at hitarththummar.xyz/posts/mahabharat
[18:17:53] <Arya[m]> ok
[18:17:55] <gtlsgamr> That is made using the index section.. 
[18:18:03] <gtlsgamr> once you got it.. pls say yes.
[18:18:12] <Arya[m]> k
[18:19:29] <gtlsgamr> lets wait for NeoVoid[m] 
[18:19:39] <pystardust> gtlsgamr: yo im up if u want
[18:19:49] <gtlsgamr> Yo!
[18:19:54] <gtlsgamr> Look at my previous messages
[18:20:44] <NeoVoid[m]> gtlsgamr: yep looking very good to me
[18:20:55] <NeoVoid[m]> whats seems to problem there?
[18:21:36] <gtlsgamr> So now... only thing that sux is that I need the files sorted by DATE variable that is sourced in line number 50.
[18:22:23] <gtlsgamr> currently they are being sorted by modification time
[18:22:32] <gtlsgamr> but i need them sorted by the date variable in their header part
[18:22:34] <gtlsgamr> does that make sense?
[18:23:25] <NeoVoid[m]> gtlsgamr: hmm
[18:23:34] <NeoVoid[m]> eval "$line" ?
[18:23:57] <gtlsgamr> the first three lines in each .md file is name=xyz, date=xyz, desc=xyz
[18:24:03] <gtlsgamr> so it sources these 3 linesone by one
[18:24:10] <gtlsgamr> so we have the user entered date in $date variable
[18:24:12] <pystardust> gtlsgamr: whats the date var format?
[18:24:21] <gtlsgamr> YYYY-MM-DD
[18:24:51] <pystardust> Perfect, just make a tmp file (tsv) date and file name
[18:25:06] <pystardust> sort -n it, and cut -f2
[18:25:35] <NeoVoid[m]> Thanks the god of bash comes now I can go back to watch anime xD.
[18:26:12] <pystardust> NeoVoid[m]: which one? U watching
[18:27:11] <NeoVoid[m]> pystardust: i cant tell here. its awkward.
[18:27:12] <gtlsgamr> pystardust: let me check
[18:27:12] <NeoVoid[m]> xD.
[18:28:16] <pystardust> NeoVoid[m]: get irc/matrix and msg me üí®
[18:28:27] <gtlsgamr> pystardust: Suppose two files have same $date
[18:28:35] <gtlsgamr> how to make sure alphabetical supremacy?
[18:28:47] <NeoVoid[m]> pystardust: i messaged you with matrix just like you said.
[18:28:51] <pystardust> sort with out -n will do it
[18:29:15] <NeoVoid[m]> you didnt recieved it i guess
[18:29:25] <pystardust> NeoVoid[m]: @pystardust:libera.chat u can ping this on matrix too
[18:29:53] <pystardust> I dont open matrix but u can text me on this address from matrix
[18:30:36] <NeoVoid[m]> pystardust: yep on same addressed i messaged you.
[18:32:47] <pystardust> gtlsgamr: since u have tsv with date and filename, sort will sort by date and then the file name, so its exactly what u want
[18:33:31] <gtlsgamr> Doesn't seem to be working
[18:33:40] <gtlsgamr> sh.hitarththummar.xyz/dbYu.test
[18:33:43] <gtlsgamr> try this
[18:34:33] <gtlsgamr> sorry try this sh.hitarththummar.xyz/P6sM.test
[18:40:52] <pystardust> ah, the number are in digits without zero padding right? it is working (ordering with alpha)
[18:41:11] <gtlsgamr> What the fuck are you talking about?
[18:41:28] <gtlsgamr> They have 0 padding
[18:41:30] <gtlsgamr> of course they have
[18:42:22] <pystardust> gtlsgamr: it is alphabetical order bro
[18:42:44] <gtlsgamr> Ah!
[18:42:45] <gtlsgamr> Fuck
[18:42:56] <pystardust> you need to zero pad the episodes
[18:43:17] <pystardust> there is still a way to order these guys but that will get ugly if you have non mahabarath shit
[18:43:29] <gtlsgamr> I will 0 pad the episodes
[18:43:36] <pystardust> yup
[19:36:57] * VoidSoul[m] Just testing...

[19:41:22] <VoidSoul[m]> pystardust: yes dont know why
[19:42:10] <VoidSoul[m]> Testing is this stil italics?
[19:42:32] * VoidSoul[m] i bet this one is italics
[19:43:03] <axxsh[m]> No
[19:43:24] <VoidSoul[m]> Ohh now i got it i was using wrong keybinds 
[19:44:17] * VoidSoul[m] i thought i was sending message infact i was actually sending emotes
[19:44:42] <VoidSoul[m]> i got correct keybinds now
[19:45:02] <axxsh[m]> VoidSoul[m]: There is a star before your name
[19:45:06] <axxsh[m]> I mean *
[19:45:21] <axxsh[m]> s/star/*/
[19:45:38] * gtlsgamr is laughing 
[19:46:21] * VoidSoul[m] surprised
[19:46:37] <VoidSoul[m]> emotes are emotions 
[19:47:59] <axxsh[m]> ü§î
[19:48:18] * VoidSoul[m] :smiles
[19:48:29] <NeoVoid[m]> not emoji
[19:48:31] <NeoVoid[m]> * not emojis
[19:48:42] <axxsh[m]> :) like these?
[19:49:05] <smud[m]> Bridge?
[19:49:40] <VoidSoul[m]> üòÄ not quite right may be old irc champions can enlighten what it is actually.
[19:50:18] * smud[m] tries to replicate it
[19:50:28] <smud[m]> Oh, this thing
[19:50:31] <VoidSoul[m]> axxsh[m]: no you express your emotions by typing out it
[19:50:53] <axxsh[m]> confused
[19:51:04] <axxsh[m]> Like these ü§î
[19:51:21] <VoidSoul[m]> like this colon and emotion :winks
[19:51:33] * VoidSoul[m] :winks
[19:51:49] <smud[m]> ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
[19:53:03] <VoidSoul[m]> it doesnt show up any character art or symobls or emojis it just old way to convey emotions or reactions or actions before emojis were invented in irc
[19:53:40] <VoidSoul[m]> when the era was of plain text no graphics at all
[19:54:25] <VoidSoul[m]> <gtlsgamr> "is laughing..." <- yeah like this
[19:54:32] <axxsh[m]> VoidSoul[m]: So its like saying "i am smiling" without smiling.
[19:54:49] <VoidSoul[m]> axxsh[m]: So its like saying "i am smiling" without smiling.
[19:54:49] <VoidSoul[m]> yep
[19:54:59] <VoidSoul[m]> thats the idea
[19:55:18] * VoidSoul[m] sighs
[19:58:33] <smud[m]> matrix has some new tricks too
[19:58:48] * smud[m] shows new tricks
[19:59:30] <VoidSoul[m]> !rainbow rainbow text
[19:59:51] <smud[m]> not like that
[20:00:11] <VoidSoul[m]> my bad i never get that right
[20:00:19] <VoidSoul[m]> xD
[20:04:26] <gtlsgamr> VoidSoul[m]: smud[m]: It is called "actions". It is used for showing that you're doing something. It is just a type of novelty message.
[20:04:40] * gtlsgamr is explaining to deez noobz what actions are
[20:09:27] <Arya[m]> lol
[20:09:39] <NeoVoid[m]> xD
