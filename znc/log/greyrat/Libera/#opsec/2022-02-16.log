[01:37:03] <Joanna> Hi Roey I guess that happens a lot when employers get new management. I had a similar experience when the leaders of company were replaced by other people, the whole culture of the place changed.
[01:38:05] <Joanna> Speaking of companies I listened to interesting podcast about Timothy mcveigh yesterday
[01:39:10] <Roey> aye
[01:39:17] <Joanna> Also I’ve heard that microwaves damage food
[01:39:21] <Roey> oh? what did you find interesting about it?
[01:39:32] <Roey> Joanna: put a banana in the microwave, go back in time.  El psy congroo.
[01:39:46] <Roey> #steinsgate
[01:40:27] <Joanna> The podcast indicated he was part of special ops and there were other people putting explosives in the building
[01:40:48] <Joanna> Yea I saw that series.

[02:59:38] <jan6> comment: Garry Sarney 3 days ago As a person who works at a retailer that uses these accounts - there is another interesting thing: You can enable demo mode during the OOBE - which bypasses the need to create/login to a msoft account, Click 5 times on the title text in any of the first few menus in OOBE 
[03:02:35] *** Quits: Malvolio (~Malvolio@user/malvolio) (Killed (lead.libera.chat (Nickname regained by services)))
[03:02:51] <jan6> and one about changing the pass: 1. Go to your RDM account's settings on the website (same way as a normal microsoft account) 2. Go to Security 3. Advanced security settings 4. Email a code 5. Input an email of yours that you can access in order to enter the code on the next step 6. Change password but click forgot password 7. Get the code from your email and 8. Change your password with a smile :)
[03:05:08] <jan6> so you can basically just set up a win10 VM, go to retail demo, generate a new account using it, and have a "mainstream" account with no personal info attached, and mainstream addresses like outlook and gmail are accepted by literally everyone, even dumbass places which don't accept perfectly valid normal addresses

[05:16:03] <Joanna> YouTube isn’t stupid they want to limit the dissemination of stuff they don’t agree with getting too many views without their permission by rate limiting it and identifying the people watching it . Same thing as Reddit quarantine. The solution is to post videos elsewhere , not whining helplessly.
[05:17:18] <jan6> where's rate limiting?
[05:17:24] <jan6> where's identifying?
[05:17:41] <jan6> where's whining helplessly?
[05:26:05] <Joanna> A lot of people have been banned from YouTube and put the videos on their own websites
[05:29:30] *** Joins: moose (~moose@user/moose)
[05:34:51] <jan6> main reason why people don't put videos on their own websites are 1) heavy bandwidth, and 2) discoverability
[05:35:10] <jan6> which is why people tend to use embedded videos from other sites instead
[05:37:03] <Joanna> It’s also quite likely that the owners of alternative video platforms that are full of unmoderated garbage are owned by the same interests that own YouTube. So of course anyone who puts videos there will be discredited. It’s just like uncensored irc networks with poor quality people on them.
[05:38:53] <Joanna> Also anyone interested in trucker revolution can see it on odyssey
[05:53:18] <jan6> which is one of the alternative video platforms, which you imply are full of garbage

[15:18:03] <Joanna> YouTube was great in the early days but it’s full of advertisements and censorship and that isn’t going to change in fact it’s going to get a lot worse. So like it or not people have to either give up videos about unapproved topics or go somewhere else that doesn’t censor or make their own website with adequate bandwidth. Whining about YouTube is pathetic. What is he expecting? For YouTube to back down on the censorship? 
[15:18:03] <Joanna> It’s not happening. People should go to and support places that treat them well.

[17:15:36] <Joanna> _flood: not sure I’ve never posted videos.  I wonder how decentralized video hosting would work... I’m not really familiar with all the stuff on alternate platforms. I like odysee because it has no advertisements but it is often slow. I think a lot of people who make videos want to do it for money so They want the monetization that YouTube has and are reluctant to leave. I really miss the early YouTube before monetization.
[17:16:04] <_flood> agreed
[17:16:26] <_flood> i was an earlier vimeo user but i think they are almost as bad as youtube
[17:16:32] <Joanna> There is nothing stopping people from hosting videos and
[17:16:41] <Joanna> On their own computer is there
[17:16:43] <_flood> correct, but then you are subject to where you are hosting
[17:16:48] <_flood> or their ISPs
[17:17:00] <_flood> they can shut that down pretty quick
[17:17:14] <_flood> especially if you are trying to stay anonymous
[17:17:46] <Joanna> Or maybe put videos on your own website like Corbett had to do after he was kicked off YouTube
[17:17:58] <_flood> yeah
[17:18:11] <_flood> i'm definitely interested in decentralized platforms for posting blogs/videos/etc.
[17:18:55] <Joanna> I like the idea of decentralized messaging that can’t be shut down. I’m no expert on how to implement it though
[17:21:20] *** Joins: Zwolf12 (mosh@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/zwolf12)
[17:21:36] <Joanna> I think it’s only a matter of time before the powers that be shut off internet access to people they don’t like most likely. If there is rebellious stuff that is getting too popular you can be sure they will stop it. All they have to do is threaten whomever is hosting it.
[17:22:42] <Joanna> _flood: wasnt bit torrent decentralized? Do people still use that or was it stopped?
[17:23:16] <_flood> i believe it was decentralized, not sure how active it is used

[17:24:35] <Joanna> People liked to get free movies and games there I think
[17:24:48] <jan6> odysee is just Yet Another Platform, which seems alright, and has the most traction, but I don't see there being nothing that prevents stuff from being taken down at any point
[17:26:17] <jan6> d.tube ain't too bad either, although last I checked, it lacked the sort of stuff I like, and was mainly "talking while walking", and crypto videos, or such, maybe it's better now
[17:27:33] <Joanna> There are many schools of thought on if there should even be copyright protections. Most of human history didn’t have copyrights or patents and if people didn’t want to be copied they kept things to themselves...
[17:27:42] <jan6> also torrents are still around, but as has been for a looong while, it's full of copyright trolls, it was never designed to be anonymous, and so, everyone can see everyone else who's asking for pieces of the file, and as such, can report them to the ISP or whatnot
[17:28:08] <Zwolf12> hah
[17:28:23] <Zwolf12> i though i was the only one still using torrents
[17:28:30] <jan6> I don't use 'em, lol
[17:28:41] <jan6> from what I've heard, doing continuous downloads, is much less likely to get reported, tho
[17:29:06] <jan6> and of course, usenet's binary boards are also very popular for piracy, from what I've heard, especially movies and such
[17:29:21] *** Joins: Malvolio (~Malvolio@user/malvolio)

[17:30:13] <Joanna> What do you torrent? Weren’t torrents changed from what they once were?
[17:30:16] <jan6> it is, Joanna, because if they beat you, then that just means they ALSO invented it, and you were just too slow to apply ;P

[17:44:58] <jan6> *with
[17:46:18] <jan6> it totally makes sense the way it was at first, that you get a few years of exclusive usage of your tech, and then it goes public, and anyone can use it privately without a license, for personal use
[17:46:54] <Zwolf12> yes
[17:47:03] <jan6> but nowdays it's practically forever, copyright goes for years after you die, and patents last nigh forever too

[17:49:01] <jan6> also fun fact, from most countries, you can officially register your copyright at US, also, (and sometimes there's local facilities too for that), which isn't required for anything, but is useful if you think someone's gonna try stealing it, since you'll have a public record that you made it
[17:49:47] <jan6> because otherwise, if they wipe your name from it, it's gonna be pretty hard to conclusively prove who was first

[17:54:04] <Joanna> Zwolf12: I think all the things that we perceive as freedom on internet are just for the convenience of their data mining efforts. Which is a double edged sword.
[17:55:57] *** Joins: s1gyn (~s1gyn@user/s1gyn)
[17:58:51] <Joanna> I’m kind of skeptical about all the so called big events that are just allowed to happen to give the illusion of freedom. The blm protests last year they could have easily caught all the people who had cell phones there but didn’t. They were allowed to happen. The trucker convoy I wonder who is behind that and if it will be suddenly be crushed after building up everyone’s hopes. Things are seldom what they seem
[18:01:08] <Zwolf12> nyt has a report on the funders of the truckers
[18:01:37] <Joanna> It’s strange how most people do nothing for decade after decade as more and more rights are gotten rid of and then suddenly almost overnight there are big protests with thousands of people.  I can’t believe it happened by itself.
[18:02:06] <Zwolf12> and french police officially got access to protonVPN mail infos of protesters in FR
[18:02:12] <Zwolf12> i agree that they have all the data
[18:02:17] <Zwolf12> and let things happen
[18:02:21] <Zwolf12> to some extent
[18:02:47] <Zwolf12> even though protonVPN is swiss
[18:02:52] <Joanna> It could also be a big scam to get people to donate thinking they are helping and whomever owns the account takes it all and retires in a tropical paradise:)
[18:02:55] <Zwolf12> we heard of it
[18:03:00] <Zwolf12> must most of the time we don't
[18:03:56] <Joanna> When it comes down to it people can’t be trusted to not snitch in most cases.
[18:04:35] <Zwolf12> this is the reason why is pretend everything is logged n veryone is a fed =) 
[18:04:49] <Joanna> I wonder if soros is helping the truckers.. he created that immigrant caravan..
[18:05:19] <Zwolf12> read the report the data has been leaked 
[18:05:25] <Zwolf12> n analyized by journalists
[18:05:39] <Joanna> I’ve met a lot of rather strange people in irc that were probably government assets..
[18:06:14] <Joanna> So the go fund me for truckers was a honeypot?
[18:06:41] <Joanna> Who was behind it? Anyone famous?

[18:09:27] <Zwolf12> it wasn't 
[18:09:36] <Zwolf12> they just suck at opsec
[18:09:41] <Zwolf12> n got leaked
[18:09:46] <Joanna> Do you have a link?
[18:10:08] <Zwolf12> i'm on my vm i can't copy stuff rn
[18:10:18] <Zwolf12> but type nyt trucker funders
[18:10:26] <Zwolf12> but type 'nyt trucker funders'
[18:10:33] <Joanna> They turned over the donor list to the government didn’t they ?
[18:10:37] <Zwolf12> in whatever search engine you want
[18:10:51] <Zwolf12> no to a whistleblowers site 
[18:11:13] <Zwolf12> but they read the newspapers too = )
[18:11:21] <Zwolf12> the gov officials i mean
[18:13:56] <Joanna> I don’t trust news media much
[18:14:29] <Zwolf12> select/ chose several journalists 
[18:14:34] <Zwolf12> ditch the rest
[18:14:34] <Joanna> This all seems like something soros would pull off.
[18:14:49] <Joanna> I only like Corbett at moment
[18:15:08] <Zwolf12> militants are militants
[18:15:16] <Zwolf12> some of the have unlimited ressources
[18:15:22] <Zwolf12> others don't
[18:15:28] <Zwolf12> i don't judge them
[18:15:33] <Joanna> Well meaning people are easy to dupe
[18:16:10] <jan6> 16:40 <Zwolf12> i'm on my vm i can't copy stuff rn
[18:16:17] <jan6> haven't set up copy-paste integrations? ;P
[18:16:30] <Joanna> Movements get hijacked or destroyed
[18:17:18] <jan6> 16:35 <Joanna> I’ve met a lot of rather strange people in irc that were probably government assets..
[18:17:26] <jan6> technically literally everyone is a government asset ;P
[18:17:31] <Zwolf12> haha
[18:17:48] <Joanna> Do you remember that occupy wall street thing where people were camping all over the place? What did that accomplish...
[18:18:07] <Zwolf12> are you saying resistance is futile ? 
[18:18:18] <jan6> and no one official trying to infiltrate a place would be weird
[18:18:22] <jan6> EXISTENCE is futile
[18:18:31] <Zwolf12> = )
[18:18:48] <jan6> also riots and protests happen because people are fed up, not because they think they suddenly have the power to fix something
[18:19:20] <Joanna> Well for most people yes because they don’t even understand that there is a problem so no chance at all of solving it.
[18:20:39] <Joanna> Like it or not our fates are intertwined with the actions or complacency of those around us.

[18:20:52] <jan6> to an extent
[18:21:03] <jan6> you can always change the people around you
[18:21:27] <Zwolf12> if they appoint you for that yes
[18:21:31] <Zwolf12> if not ...
[18:21:33] <jan6> no
[18:22:03] <jan6> you can just literally move to a different place, and get a different job, and change all contact info, and boom, nobody who knew you before is gonna be able to be around you ;P
[18:22:19] <Zwolf12> haaa 
[18:22:20] <Zwolf12> sorry
[18:22:29] <Zwolf12>  i understood sthg different
[18:22:33] <Zwolf12> ignore last msg
[18:24:57] <jan6> also, apparently mobile network relays are a thing, in the sense that you can buy a kit, and run ethernet, or fiber, a ways away, into somewhere where normally there's no reception or something, and boom, have reception
[18:25:35] <jan6> which could be cool way to fake your location, if you manage to covertly do that at a good enough distance
[18:26:09] <jan6> and also good if you want to make calls in a bunker or somesuch, you can just unplug it when you want to be isolated ;P
[18:26:44] <Zwolf12> perhaps that shoud be you next project haha
[18:26:59] <Zwolf12> i appreciate your errant thoughs 
[18:33:57] <Joanna> Zwolf12: I have a lot of experience with what could be considered war gaming and I can say that the biggest danger is not the enemies but rather the people that are supposedly on your side doing the wrong things or failing to act.
[18:34:25] <jan6> obviously
[18:34:30] <jan6> trust, but verify
[18:34:40] <Zwolf12> never trust
[18:34:43] <Zwolf12> blackmail

[18:38:31] <Joanna> In any case you need a team to accomplish big things
[18:38:38] <Zwolf12> faster alone
[18:38:43] <Zwolf12> further together
[18:38:45] <jan6> you don't need a team
[18:38:49] <jan6> team is cohesive
[18:38:58] <jan6> you just need accomplices and friends
[18:39:10] <jan6> you need help, but not necessarily organized help
[18:39:23] <Zwolf12> ^
[18:39:47] <Zwolf12> random networking is a force i guess
[18:40:01] <Zwolf12> plus harder to trace
[18:40:06] <Joanna> If you are in group of idiots you are more likely to succeed alone
[18:40:40] <Zwolf12> nuanced
[18:41:04] <Zwolf12> level of conversation is high here 
[18:41:11] <Zwolf12> i sincerely appreciate it 
[18:41:56] <Joanna> I’ve seen large groups fail and small groups 4 people win
[18:46:43] <Joanna> If people aren’t organized they get killed and lose all their stuff. It’s as simple as that.
[18:52:10] <Zwolf12> FSB organizes ops without knowledge of participants involved that thye a part of a team
[18:52:21] <Zwolf12> this type of things inspire me a lot more 
[18:52:36] <Zwolf12> that they*
[18:52:47] <Joanna> Fsb?
[18:52:59] <Zwolf12> russian gov
[18:53:13] <Joanna> Are you russian?
[18:53:19] <Zwolf12> silly question 
[18:53:50] <Joanna> How would I know?
[18:54:22] <Zwolf12> the theme is opsec
[18:54:35] <Joanna> Of course
[18:55:02] <Joanna> I’d like to know what is happening in Russia is all
[18:55:12] <Zwolf12> i'll never tell you my nationality or current location 
[18:55:15] <Zwolf12> nor will anyone
[18:55:25] <Zwolf12> all this is public knowledge
[18:56:39] <Joanna> I like to talk to people directly rather than relying on media
[18:57:08] <Zwolf12> watch infocon stuff Joanna
[18:57:12] <Joanna> Well I like to be able too
[18:57:13] <Zwolf12> they have tons of ressources
[18:57:38] <Joanna> Ask questions. If I can’t ask questions I disregard.
[18:59:40] <Joanna> Lack of good leadership and training can cause failure .
[19:00:13] <Zwolf12> asking questions shows level of skillset n interests 
[19:00:15] <Joanna> Being disorganized or being outgunned also
[19:00:26] <Zwolf12> and those are two very different aspects up there 
[19:00:33] <Zwolf12> anyway gtg
[19:00:44] <Joanna> Ok nice meeting you
[19:00:51] <Zwolf12> it was lovely chatting with the both of you
[19:01:12] <Joanna> See you later maybe
[19:01:22] <Zwolf12> i will come back
[19:01:24] <Zwolf12> as i said

[23:59:03] <Bitweasil> The two aren't often found together.
[23:59:06] <Bitweasil> ... oh, that has networking.
