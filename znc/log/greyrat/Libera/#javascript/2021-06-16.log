[00:02:38] <GreenJello> onosendi, for small projects the convenience of being able to easily share a link that someone can run/edit outweighs the downsides of coding in a browser tab
[00:02:50] <GreenJello> I don't know what next live is, though
[00:03:34] <jaawerth_> better in a browser than forcing everyone to install a specific editor and/or specific pluign for specific editor for realtime collab, which would be very mistake-prone. mind you, I'm skeptical of realtime collab to begin with when it comes to coding, with the exception of, like, "here let me show you real quick" kinda stuff
[00:04:00] <jaawerth_> GreenJello: seems to be this https://nextjs.org/live
[00:04:28] <jaawerth_> onosendi: anyway that isn't emant for day-to-day work
[00:04:42] <jaawerth_> unless you do pair coding all day with a remote partner, in which case you have other problems lol
[00:06:44] <albertlast> well sap got something similiar, and it's nice when you need a complex env like full fledge database etc.
[00:10:27] <jaawerth_> usecases will vary, but in my experience this stuff is almost always some variant of "I need to share a sample thing, without other people having to set up the exact same tooling/host platforms/etc"

[01:52:55] <wroathe> jundran: Also, there's a technique here that can save you a ton of pain (and fix your original problem), called "event delegation". The idea is to bind your event listener to an ancestor element of the set of elements you would've otherwise bound it to. So document.body.addEventListener('click', e => { const season = e.target.closest('.season'); if (!season) return; displaySeason(season); });
[01:53:54] <jundran> I'm going to refactor but for now I just used a mix of the two and it works. https://bpa.st/75GQ
[01:54:18] <wroathe> jundran: Also, unrelated to that, if you were going to continue down this road you should've selected your seasons with querySelectorAll, instead of giving them an ID and looping through as you've done there. E.g. const seasons = document.querySelectorAll('.my-show-season'); seasons.forEach(...);
[01:54:42] <wroathe> jundran: You should really try to avoid innerHTML
[01:56:54] <jundran> the idea is to loop and display the episodes in the season. i'm going to change it to just show one season's info at once onclick

[01:58:13] <wroathe> jundran: Yup. In general if you're dealing with loops over elements from the DOM you need to select querySelectorAll is what you want.
[01:58:36] <wroathe> jundran: querySelector requires you to perform a search for each individual element, where querySelectorAll performs a search all of the elements you want, and then you can loop over that collection.
[02:02:16] <entuland> another small remark, just since I noticed - you could have used className instead of setting the attribute, but for classes there is classList that lets you add, remove and toggle classes without worrying about what other classes could be there already
[02:02:37] <entuland> may come in handy in another context
[02:03:58] *** Praise- is now known as Praise
[02:06:51] <wroathe> I generally reach for setAttribute there, because it works nicer in loops where you want to set attributes from an object: const createEl = (el, attrs = {}) => Object.entries(attrs).reduce((el, ([name, val]) => (el.setAttribute(name, val), el), document.createElement(el));  // or something like that

[02:16:07] <wroathe> jundran: The main problems with innerHTML that I can think of are that 1. It completely replaces the contents of the element you use it with, and destroys the DOM nodes that were there. You then lose any data or event listeners you had bound on those elements and will need to re-register them and 2. It opens you up to cross-site scripting in the event you include any form of user input in the HTML
[02:16:13] <wroathe> string without first sanitizing it.
[02:16:43] <wroathe> jundran: For these two reasons (and maybe others) people generally seek to avoid using innerHTML, and instead prefer to just construct the DOM nodes manually and append them where necessary.
[02:17:32] <hassoon> innerHTML should be used only on limited small nodes for minor reasons

[02:26:07] <entuland> honestly, not sure
[02:26:35] <entuland> not much for the fact that you're using innerHTML, but for the fact that you're interspersing your theming into the JS
[02:26:55] <entuland> sorry, not theming, templating
[02:27:48] <jundran> it's a lot of extra code having to declare everything in the html then querySelect the elements and write to them individually

[02:28:08] <hassoon> jundran: what are you trying to do ? why are you using innerHTML at all ?
[02:28:23] <entuland> I know many nowadays consider it silly to try and support page usability with JS turned off, but wherever possible I still try and achieve that - which means templating the content on the server side and using AJAX to retrieve such document parts already templated by the server side
[02:28:34] <entuland> and if JS isn't available fallback to a full page reload
[02:28:41] <jundran> the data is from an api
[02:28:57] <entuland> with templating done client side by JS, you can't support js-less usage of your page

[02:58:09] <wroathe> entuland: That's not silly at all. I've been advocating that for years. Today's kids call it "isomorphic" rendering. Combine that with progressive enhancement, and you've got an application that can serve a basic functioning HTML-only webpage to the end user for any route in your application, and then Javascript enhances it to provide further interactivity (including the ability to use History API
[02:58:15] <wroathe> routing instead of page refreshes)
[02:59:37] <entuland> eh, I agree on that approach, but you know, tastes, POV, "it's 20XX" and so forth :P
[03:00:03] <entuland> some people definitely _think_ it's silly to try and have working websites even when JS fails or is off
[03:00:21] <entuland> of course some things simply aren't meant to be run without JS, and that's okay
[03:00:33] <hassoon> ya a capable html/css-only is a nice idea
[03:00:40] <hassoon> bu js is also nice
[03:01:07] <hassoon> * html/css-only website *
[03:01:27] <hassoon> there are css only games
[03:01:28] <hassoon> etc
[03:01:50] <entuland> the point isn't not using JS, it's not using it for stuff that can be done without it to ensure functionality in a greater ranger of cases
[03:02:05] <hassoon> o no, this chocolate cookies turned out to be not so good
[03:02:54] <hassoon> entuland: ah sure, if we can make something useful without js, why not? that's awesome
[03:03:09] <hassoon> i agree with that
[03:03:20] <hassoon> i mean the heavy duty tasks, would be done with js
[03:03:35] <hassoon> like that dude of before, who wanted to make split panels with css/html
[03:03:37] <hassoon> remember ?
[03:03:56] <entuland> I remember, and I'm happy to see that you agree on that
[03:04:19] * hassoon highfives entuland 
[03:04:59] <notchris> yes
[03:06:24] <hassoon> there was this guy too, who showed us a css-only 3D game, https://keithclark.co.uk/labs/css-fps/nojs/

[03:09:36] <wroathe> entuland: It's not really about it being 20xx or newness or anythign like that. Web apps turn out objectively _better_ when you force yourself to follow that pattern. You end up using HTML and HTML attributes for functionality that you need that they already handle, instead of using Javascript to reimplement them.
[03:09:52] <entuland> I mean, the fact that something can be achieved in pure HTML+CSS (as we discussed the other time about the split panel) doesn't mean it's a good idea in "production", so to speak
[03:10:09] <hassoon> ah okey

[03:12:04] <wroathe> entuland: For example, I had one project where a fairly significant portion of the event handlers bound to <button> elements existed just to change routes like <button type="button" class="checkout-button" onclick="navigateTo("/cart")">Checkout</button>
[03:12:08] <entuland> and not coming from noobs, coming from seemingly knowledgeable users
[03:12:29] <wroathe> entuland: Rather than just using anchor tags and event delegation
[03:13:55] <entuland> yup, using the best tags at hand to convey the functionality is... better :P
[03:14:05] <wroathe> entuland: <a href="/cart">Checkout</a>     document.addEventListener('click', e => { const a = e.target.closest('a'); if (!a) return; navigateTo(a.href); }); // pseudo-code, we were using riot.js and a few other utilities
[03:14:53] <wroathe> The benefit to this approach is 1. It's progressively enhanced. Without Javascript the anchor tag functions like it's supposed to (albeit with a full page refresh) and 2. It's less and better code

[03:16:24] <ljharb> +1
[03:16:36] <wroathe> (oh, I forgot a preventDefault in that handler)
[03:16:38] <entuland> and on the bright side a lot of frameworks do such heavy lifting for the developer in a transparent way - as long as they cooperate with the framework and don't try and rub it the wrong way

[12:54:41] <theskillwithin> hehe you asked my bot for help
[12:54:59] <robyndrake> was curious as to it's commands
[12:55:02] <theskillwithin> https://github.com/theskillwithin/skillbot
[12:55:23] <robyndrake> and I was thinking skill as in a skills test
[13:00:40] <theskillwithin> robyndrake welp you haz access to the code of skillbot now, so u know all the commands
[13:01:15] <theskillwithin> of which im sorry are boring
[13:01:27] <robyndrake> ironically I've been spending part of this night fiddling with typescript and an IRC bot

[13:03:08] <theskillwithin> robyndrake im not sure what the rules are, but if you plan on bringing an IRC bot in here prob let us know about it first
[13:03:32] <robyndrake> I wouldn't bring it to #javascript here
[13:03:42] <robyndrake> probably irc.tilde.chat
[13:03:51] <robyndrake> my main IRC network
[13:09:12] <theskillwithin> robyndrake welp good luck
[13:10:06] <robyndrake> the problem is it's 3:39am and I'm yawning
[13:10:27] <robyndrake> I'm just waiting for the nursing home's cat to come in demanding food
[13:10:46] <robyndrake> He is usually in here by now doing such
[13:11:40] <robyndrake> sorry all for all this off-topic chatter, I'll be quiet now
[13:12:40] <theskillwithin> robyndrake welp not a fan ur trying to mimick our code. but despite that i gave to you link to direct code
[13:13:05] <theskillwithin> so do what you want

[13:15:55] <robyndrake> such code is gone though
[13:19:05] <theskillwithin> robyndrake if you have good intentions,  then im a friend

[16:39:16] <LeoTal> Hello friends. I'm using Multer for file upload, like so: `@UseInterceptors(FileInterceptor('file')) myControllerMethod(@UploadedFile() file: Express.Multer.File) {…etc.}`. For terrible reasons, I need to rename the query param to "filename". But I'd still like the function arg to be called "file", not "filename". Is that possible?

[21:21:42] <wroathe> node1: It depends on how you design the backend, and what you return to the client. Your options are basically either sending back the image's data in the response, or sending back a link to the image on the server.
[21:22:20] <node1> wroathe, sending back the image's data in the response.
[21:22:59] <wroathe> node1: So you can make an endpoint that responds to GET requests for image data, and then set an image element's src property to the desired time period by using a query string parameter

[22:32:45] <wroathe> peteyboy1: It basically boils down to a "push" model or a "pull" (polling) model. The session is server state, and so you need a mechanism for accessing that from the UI.
[22:33:08] <wroathe> peteyboy1: A "push" model might, for example, make use of a long running websockets connection, and then respond to messages sent from the server to the client about session state.

[22:35:08] <wroathe> peteyboy1: What don't you understand?
[22:35:21] <peteyboy1> is there a way of making node tell react that it's time to do whatever once the express-session ends?
[22:35:50] <wroathe> peteyboy1: Sure. You need a mechanism to communicate that, and I've recommended a long-running websockets connection as one potential avenue.
[22:36:09] <wroathe> peteyboy1: I'm not familiar with express-session, but that library may make other recommendations.
[22:37:40] <wroathe> peteyboy1: Another, less secure, model involves logging the user out only when they try to interact with the priveleged server
[22:37:56] <wroathe> But that has the security problem of keeping read only data around long after the user's session has expired
[22:39:01] <peteyboy1> wroathe, right, the last thing you explained is actually what is happening in my case. the session is not there anymore, but the page isn't refreshe until the user refreshes it
[22:39:34] <peteyboy1> so that's another reason i would need to implement the long-running connection

[22:44:27] <wroathe> peteyboy1: The main thing to reason about when you're designing this is what happens when a given client loses connectivity for a given period of time with sensitive data still on it. With a polling mechanism the client would immediately start polling again once connectivity is re-established.
[22:44:47] <wroathe> peteyboy1: With a push mechanism the client would immediately re-establish the long running connection and wait for information from the server
[22:45:19] <onosendi> peteyboy1: what are you using for state management?
[22:45:41] <wroathe> peteyboy1: If you want to be real secure you can start a timer after your long-running connection has closed (due to a loss of connectivity), and force a logout on the client by clearing all client-side state. The server would then need to periodically clean up inactive sessions.

[22:52:02] <wroathe> peteyboy1: There's a lot of potentially unrelated information to this specific problem there, but getting to a state of familiarity with identity and access management is a long road in general
[22:52:21] <peteyboy1> wroathe, ok, i'll look into it, thank you
[22:52:29] <peteyboy1> what are you doing today in the gym?
[22:52:35] <wroathe> Squats day
[22:52:45] <peteyboy1> alright, doing some kind of accessories?
[22:52:47] <wroathe> Which I hate, because I've got a bad slipped disc in my back, but I'm stubborn.
[22:53:11] <wroathe> I back off and do some volume sets with a lighter weight and different stance widths for accessories

[22:53:29] <wroathe> I'm on a modified 5/3/1 style kind of thing that I've been designing for my specific needs
[22:53:47] <peteyboy1> right. you didn't consider frontally loaded squats?

[22:54:15] <wroathe> I've got really long femurs relative to the rest of my body, and front squats are just as much of a pain in the ass.
[22:54:42] <peteyboy1> me too, i look like i'm riding an ostrich, but front squats feel heaps better
[22:54:54] <peteyboy1> without squat shoes anything feels like crap
[22:55:12] <systemfault> But squat shoes suck for anything but squating...
[22:55:26] <systemfault> And bringing two pairs of shoes at the gym sucks :(
[22:55:28] <wroathe> Indeed
[22:55:29] <peteyboy1> so you do everything else barefoot
[22:55:38] <wroathe> Yup. That's exactly what I do
[22:55:55] <peteyboy1> barefoot and squat shoes are all that's needed
[22:56:11] <peteyboy1> anything with a cushion sucks anyway

[22:56:31] <peteyboy1> wroathe, but do front squats really feel like shit? i feel that way about regular ones
[22:57:01] <peteyboy1> systemfault, and they are also good for any olympic movements, push presses, even regular presses, etc
[22:57:22] <peteyboy1> for some with effed discs even for benching
[22:57:24] <wroathe> peteyboy1: Yes
[22:57:25] <systemfault> peteyboy1: Yeah, but I don't do olympic weightlifting.

[22:57:55] <peteyboy1> systemfault, me neither, but some lifts are just perfectly fine lifts for any gymgoer
[22:58:11] <peteyboy1> high pulls, hang cleans, power cleans...
[22:58:28] <systemfault> I haven't gone to the gym since they closed it where I live because of covid :(
[22:58:50] <peteyboy1> i haven't in 3 years

[22:59:29] <systemfault> No problem then! ;)
[22:59:34] <peteyboy1> jk, i put on a tiny bit since then, but i'm at a fairly steady weight since then
