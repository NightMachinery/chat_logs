[00:00:51] <Delf> You'll be left with one option and thats shut the fuck up, clean the place, don't get in the way, exist as less as you can, do as much as you can do.
[00:00:52] <bbbbb> I still think the problem is the emotional state of the person, not the person they attack. They are angry and need to express that anger, so the easy way is to attack the closest person to them
[00:01:18] <Delf> Keep your problems to yourself and don't ever ask for help
[00:02:13] <bbbbb> When someone gets angry with you over something trivial, it's most definitely not about what you did
[00:02:20] <Delf> I feel emotionally raped and devastated so it has reached my physical health also :D

[00:03:34] <Ungwelian> I was with him for 11 years.
[00:03:48] <Delf> What went wrong?
[00:04:26] <Ungwelian> TL;DR: I was in love and he was a sort of an asshole.
[00:04:37] <Delf> Outch...
[00:04:54] <Ungwelian> But I was good at manipulating him.
[00:05:09] <Ungwelian> So it was an emotionally unhealthy rollercoaster for a decade.
[00:05:34] <Ungwelian> I really didn't know then what healthy relationships are like.

[00:06:24] <Delf> You don't seem... malevolent @ manipulating
[00:06:41] <Ungwelian> Yeah, I'm not. He brought the worst out of me too.
[00:06:47] <Ungwelian> Love can be a drug.
[00:07:10] <Delf> He did? I'm being accused of the same thing. I bring the worst ouf of her. With eveyrone else, she's alright.
[00:07:32] <Ungwelian> Well, do you treat her like a honourable gentleman?
[00:07:48] <Delf> No
[00:07:52] <Ungwelian> Well then :D
[00:07:54] <Delf> Why the hell would I do that?
[00:08:00] <Ungwelian> :D
[00:08:22] <Delf> I treat her with ten times the honor she treats me
[00:08:47] <Delf> Which might not be enough but I have limits for how bad I can treat people
[00:08:55] <Delf> She does not
[00:09:14] <Ungwelian> Does it feel like a normal relationship to you?
[00:09:23] <Delf> I don't even know what a normal relationship is
[00:09:28] <Ungwelian> Well then :D
[00:09:36] <Delf> I don't look at other's relationships and find the most occuring one
[00:09:55] <Ungwelian> There is such a thing as bad relationships :)
[00:10:07] <Delf> Indeed there is. This is one such
[00:10:34] <Ungwelian> I'll rephrase: is it a relationship, where you treat each other with mutual kindness and respect?
[00:11:20] <Delf> No, it is not

[00:53:09] <bbbbb> Ungwelian what did he do to think that?
[00:53:18] <Ungwelian> I think deconstruct love.
[00:53:26] <Ungwelian> It's been a good while since I read Yalom :)
[00:55:07] <Delf> Deconstruct love as a feeling?
[00:55:30] <Ungwelian> Yeah, pretty much.
[00:56:02] <Ungwelian> One of the very hard things I learned after my uni studies, was that deconstruction doesn't make something less real.
[00:56:18] <Delf> That one will dissolve if it is based on bullshite, otherwise it will rather get strengthened instead
[00:56:56] <Delf> Eh.. I don't do real either. But whether or not something dissolves is decided by the basis it has.
[00:59:43] <Ungwelian> It's probably something worth considering at least :)

[01:09:23] <Ungwelian> You might like Lewis's treatise on it, Delf.
[01:09:45] <Ungwelian> A short book. "The Four Loves".
[01:09:51] <Delf> Is it much to read? I'm not a fan of reading much
[01:09:59] <Delf> Four Loves!? One is not enough?
[01:10:05] <Ungwelian> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Four_Loves#The_four_loves
[01:10:05] <ro-bot-o> [url] The Four Loves - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[01:10:12] <Ungwelian> Wikipedia will give you the ultra short version :P
[01:11:00] <Delf> What do you imaigne I would like about this?
[01:11:01] <Ungwelian> Nowhere near as eloquent as Lewis, sadly.
[01:11:23] <Ungwelian> Because you wonder about what love is, and find different answers about it interesting.
[01:11:52] <Delf> I wanted to know YOUR definition and understanding of it
[01:12:04] <Delf> Specifically yours. Not just any other than mine
[01:12:31] <Ungwelian> And it's interesting because it's mine?
[01:12:41] <Delf> No. You are interesting
[01:12:47] <Ungwelian> Hehe, well, thank you :)
[01:12:58] <Delf> Don't mention it. I find people more interesting than books! >P
[01:14:55] <Ungwelian> Yeah, books are sort of monologues. And often impersonal.
[01:15:15] <Ungwelian> They don't seem quite as real and not so intimate either :)
[01:16:13] <Ungwelian> Lewis, however, writes very well. Short, to the point, and with kindness.
[01:16:44] <bbbbb> Aren't the four loves the ones from the bible?
[01:16:54] <bbbbb> Did he just expand on their meaning?
[01:17:15] <Ungwelian> Are they? Might be. Lewis was the most popular theological writer of his time.
[01:18:27] <Ungwelian> The book is ~150 small pages or so.
[01:20:53] <bbbbb> Ungwelian what about love that isn't a choice? Like love for your parents. You can  both love and hate family at the same time.
[01:23:55] *** Quits: Atque (~Atque@user/atque) (Quit: ...)
[01:24:41] <Ungwelian> Well...I think it varies a lot. I mean, some people have absolutely terrible parents.
[01:24:54] <Ungwelian> And are then raised by for example their grandparents.
[01:25:17] <Ungwelian> I've heard several people say that they didn't cry at all at their parents' funerals.
[01:26:15] <Ungwelian> People form attachments to the people they spend time with. And kids, especially so, as there's dependency.
[01:27:01] <Ungwelian> It's said that one of the difficult times for a person is realizing that their parents are human.
[01:27:25] <Ungwelian> Which I imagine happens with loving parents, who still aren't perfect.
[01:28:25] <Ungwelian> I guess the good side of that is, that you can then form mature relationships to your parents.
[01:28:29] <bbbbb> I remember the very moment I realised that...it was awful
[01:28:34] <Ungwelian> Yeah <:)
[01:29:10] <Ungwelian> Mature relationships give room for love too, fortunately. Maybe especially so.

[01:35:37] <bbbbb> Id still like method to stop loving family members...but I'll go with compassion for now
[01:39:28] <Ungwelian> Yeah :) And you don't have to take anything from your parents either.
[01:39:46] <Ungwelian> Like for example hanging up the phone on them can be quite alright :)
[01:39:49] <Delf> You don't love AND hate. You love THEN hate. Back and forth.
[01:41:01] <Ungwelian> Can't there be many emotions at the same time, Delf?
[01:41:27] <Delf> There can but they don't like sharing so they push each other out
[01:42:25] <Ungwelian> Is your relationship a rollercoaster too? :)

[01:44:28] <Delf> Why would you want to stop loving family memebers, bbbbb?

[01:52:21] <Delf> No
[01:52:33] <Ungwelian> That was a quick and short answer :D
[01:52:57] <Delf> Too good to be true? :P
[01:53:17] <Ungwelian> Well, it might mean that there's more to it.
[01:53:32] <Delf> More to what?
[01:53:41] <Ungwelian> To the no.
[01:54:01] <Delf> Hmm...
[01:54:26] <Ungwelian> It's quite common that family behaviours repeat in relationships.
[01:54:32] <bbbbb> Delf is attracted to a persons values?
[01:54:49] <Delf> I'm not like anyone else I know. My family is nothing like me.
[01:55:36] <Delf> Do I seem like the quite common assholes to you?
[01:56:15] <Delf> What kind of attraction are you talking about?
[01:56:37] <Delf> Difficult people are not automagically more sexually appealing
[01:58:11] <Ungwelian> You said for you, love is about understanding, protecting and preserving.
[01:58:43] <Ungwelian> Difficult people can need work to understand, yet also seem vulnerable and in need of protection.
[01:59:19] <Ungwelian> Preserving too, with self-destructive and chaotic behaviour.
[02:00:16] <Delf> Hold your horses
[02:01:00] <Delf> That is not what love is about. Those three, in that order and combination IS my definition of love.

[04:12:08] <thunder> I'm contemplating the word ethos as a descriptor for this sort of thing. the word means literally "character", and extends it's meaning to one's values and shared values of society. to me that seems almost synonymous with "what matters" (ie. what is your ethos).
[04:12:19] <thunder> tomathy: ^
[04:13:53] <tomathy> hmm
[04:14:12] <tomathy> yes im not as familiar with the word ethos as matter

[04:15:08] <thunder> in west african religions including vodoun and ifa, there is a saying "ayanmo ni iwa-pele, iwa-pele ni ayanmo" which translates (from yoruban) to "good/gentle character is destiny, destiny is good/gentle character"
[04:15:48] <tomathy> i like that
[04:16:00] <tomathy> thing is though, no good asking a pigeon what its ethos is
[04:16:07] <tomathy> but you can ask what matters to a pigeon
[04:16:07] <thunder> sorry. other way around. iwa-pele is "good/gentle character"
[04:17:01] <tomathy> so what matters is non specific to humanity
[04:17:02] <thunder> tomathy: you could ask, but unless you put yourself within the umwelt of the pigeon you can't really understand their ethos.
[04:17:20] <tomathy> umwelt?
[04:17:36] <thunder> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umwelt
[04:17:36] <ro-bot-o> [url] Umwelt - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[04:18:49] <thunder> for instance, pigeons have various individual and social behaviours which are specific to pigeons. you could characterize that as their ethos, though you'd need to extrapolate from human experience and overlay it onto pigeon behaviour to the extent that it matches.
[04:19:09] <thunder> like they pair bond for life
[04:19:15] <tomathy> can you ask the ethos of a rock?
[04:19:25] <thunder> the are gregarious
[04:19:40] <thunder> can you ask a rock what matters?
[04:19:52] <thunder> you can. but you may not understand the answer (if any)
[04:19:54] <tomathy> no but you can ask what matters to a rock
[04:20:29] <tomathy> what matters would just be its description i suppose
[04:20:29] <thunder> pigeons have sex something like 60 times a day on average
[04:20:44] <tomathy> you a pigeon?
[04:20:46] <thunder> so I've heard
[04:20:54] <tomathy> :P
[04:22:29] <tomathy> it's weird to think that we all look at zen buddhist dudes etc as majorly badass, but they're just living their life, copying or preserving what they know. they're doing what we would do if our ancestry and inheritance wasn't so fragmented and the state had less (or more?) control of our lives
[04:22:31] <thunder> I knew a woman who had a pigeon familiar that had pair bonded with her. she would go on international road trips and the pigeon would follow her overhead. it was basically like a parrot in a pirate movie.
[04:23:10] <tomathy> like hindus and buddhists seem very cool to me

[04:23:46] <tomathy> but the reality is they are just doing what they do, knowing what they know - and the reaosn it's cool to me is probably that i dont know wtf they are doing
[04:24:15] <thunder> I feel a lot of kindship with those traditions, from afar. I see many resemblences in their ideas to things I've come to understand on my own independently.
[04:24:49] <tomathy> like hindus for example take the idea of becoming a god very seriously, they know a perosn can become a god, which nobody really appreciates in the west
[04:25:08] <thunder> plus, having learned meditation and so on as a child, much of which was heavily derived from buddhist/hindu spiritual practices, I owe their traditions a great debt even though I don't claim them as my own with all their baggage in tow
[04:26:08] <tomathy> wonder what that was like
[04:26:31] <thunder> tomathy, the word "god" comes from nordic paganism, and the gods in those myths are characterized as people who became gods through apotheosis. just like hercules, or john frum.
[04:27:08] <tomathy> nice
[04:27:59] <thunder> it's a sort of hero cycle. if you act with exemplary character, then when you die, people will tell your story, effectively incorporating you into their mythology, and thus deifying you.
[04:28:31] <thunder> some people moreso than others
[04:28:56] <tomathy> i will be thrown in the trashcan of remembrance
[04:29:36] <tomathy> i actually hope so
[04:29:49] <tomathy> i dnt consider my ego's continuation to be an afterlife
[04:30:10] <thunder> in some sense you could say from a romantic perspective that folks like giordano bruno, newton, einstein, and many many others have been deified as sacred icons of science, because they each taught something important about the world and our place in it.
[04:30:52] <tomathy> yes if they are forgotten the science is too
[04:31:46] <thunder> precisely. their ego is important, because it becomes a rallying point by which to remember their legacy, to continue it, and thereby develop the ethos of society who holds those values important.
[04:32:15] <tomathy> the ego of newton never existed
[04:32:21] <tomathy> im reading about him
[04:32:32] <tomathy> he did science to cure his loneliness i think
[04:32:38] <tomathy> but idk
[04:32:39] <thunder> if you get a chance, try to find a copy of the bbc newton, the last magician
[04:33:00] <thunder> newton was a bit of a hardass according to his contemporaries
[04:33:12] <thunder> full of himself
[04:33:30] <thunder> though, obviously with good reason as we know
[04:33:40] <tomathy> he knew more than the entire country lol
[04:34:17] <thunder> that's perhaps stretcing it. but he had some very keen insights. a lot of it inspired by studying occultism, alchemy and hermetics
[04:35:09] <tomathy> well those things were more important back then
[04:35:26] <thunder> his thermodynamic laws are basically refinements of things empedocles was discussing 2 millennia prior
[04:35:26] <tomathy> i wonder what made him how he was, he must have found some deep use for curiosity?
[04:36:26] <thunder> he seems like someone who today we would label as autistic savant
[04:37:58] <tomathy> but he invented calculus didnt he?
[04:38:56] <tomathy> i suppose he was just a guy subject to the natural laws that he was so fascinated by, i shouldn't idolise him
[04:41:02] <tomathy> i am a weird guy, i will be inefficient for decades until my brain finds the reason for why im doing something
[04:41:20] <tomathy> it turns out you fold and stack your clothes because it makes them easier to find
[04:41:37] <tomathy> not because it's a nice neat thing to look at
[04:41:51] <tomathy> that's just whats the word
[04:41:57] <tomathy> supplemetary?
[04:42:01] <tomathy> incidental
[04:42:37] <tomathy> and if they're easy to find (and retrieve) then you can get changed in a reasonable time
[04:43:04] <tomathy> if they aren't then you're stood there naked or filthy looking for your clothes forever
[04:44:06] <tomathy> and so it's hardly the folding that's important, that just saves space, but the seperation between clothing is a core feature, that people ignore because they know all of this, or have decided on the way to do it without thought
[04:44:24] <tomathy> the seperation is key
[04:44:48] <tomathy> and folding is just a way to seperate even more

[05:19:02] <thunder> it's a shame to me that it's become such an antagonistic divide. I see no issue with integrating all such perspectives, theist and atheist alike, into my possible worldviews. for instance, atheism is a perspective which helps me cut the crap and be real with myself. theism is a romantic/poetic perspective which is emotionally moving and can be transformative when expressed in a ritualized form, like a dance of meaning making.
[05:20:57] <thunder> I once spoke with some freemasons, who don't allow atheists to join. I wanted to get to the bottom of why that is so. so they have 3 questions you must answer yes to to be eligible, "do you believe in a supreme being?", "do you believe that being reveals itself to mankind?", "do you believe that being rewards virtue and punishes vice?"
[05:22:07] <thunder> I told them I could answer "yes" to all 3 questions from an atheist perspective, if by "supreme being" I take it to mean "nature". in that sense it's will is revealed through natural laws, and if one acts in harmony or disharmony with them, one will have experience accordingly.
[05:22:45] <thunder> I was told an atheist still could not join, because they wouldn't benefit form the ceremonies due to lacking the requisite "perspective of the sacred".
[05:23:09] <thunder> I found that rather insightful

[05:30:17] <thunder> god is a word practically devoid of any meaning. the more you study theology the more you understand that even in monotheistic belief systems the definition varies wildly, to say nothing of from person to person. it's just gibberish that people argue over like nerds trying arguing about which marvel superhero is the best one, with nukes.
[05:31:13] <causative> eh I don't think it is devoid of meaning - God means "a super powerful mind, similar to a human mind but more and better, running things."
[05:31:35] <causative> or "a big ghost man in charge"
[05:31:38] <thunder> maybe. but other people may see god in a droplet of water.
[05:31:44] <thunder> it's subjective
[05:32:17] <causative> well, that's just atheism with extra steps
[05:32:20] <thunder> as the trolls in other channels say, it's magical sky jew
[05:32:55] <tomathy> god aint a jew jews were just the messengers

[05:33:26] <causative> if a droplet of water is God - not that you see some intelligent mind in a droplet of water that you could talk to and that has opinions, but that the droplet of water by itself, with no extra powers, is supposed to be God - that's atheism with extra steps

[05:36:33] <causative> the concept of God comes from the human instinct for social hierarchy, trying to apply the ideas of social hierarchy to the natural world (inappropriately, because the natural world is not a human social hierarchy)
[05:37:04] <causative> God is fundamentally a social concept - a stern father, a powerful commander, with which you have a personal relationship and can please or displease
[05:37:39] <tomathy> god is the mackdaddy
[05:37:41] <thunder> I tend to agree. myth is often a romantic portral of nature in the form of allegory.
[05:37:55] <thunder> using human relationships as the model
[05:38:11] <thunder> so you can tell more than one story at the same time
[05:38:24] <tomathy> maybe "the story" is a new term for God
[05:38:30] <tomathy> if people have good stories life is better
[05:39:03] <causative> social hierarchy instincts conflict with truth-seeking instincts all the time, religion is just one example of it
[05:39:06] <thunder> the story has always been god. as in many religions, not just abrahamic "the word" or "sound"
[05:39:07] <tomathy> i guess that's why "the word" is used
[05:40:00] <causative> thinking critically and for yourself, relying on evidence instead of what authorities tell you - in short, the honest and rational pursuit of truth - is inherently subverting of hierarchy
[05:40:05] <thunder> the word is interesting in a semiotic sense too. if you imagine the material world as the symbolic representation of the meaning held in the mind of a creator being. it's romantic
[05:40:31] <causative> conversely, hierarchy thus is inherently suppressing of the honest and rational pursuit of truth

[06:01:30] <tomathy> i suppose i could just use a library
[06:04:24] <tomathy> sorry
[06:14:15] <thunder> I relate. my wake/sleep schedule is longer that most other people, so left to my own devices my waking period revolves around the day from week to week. it's hell on conventional scheduling, but relative to trying to put a square peg in a round hole to conform with social convention, it's bliss.
[06:31:50] <thunder> I posit that all emotions are derivatives of pain and pleasure. for instance if you strike a horse on the buttocks, it feels pain and so moves forward out of fear in an attempt to avoid it a second time. similarly if a horse takes a bite of good tasting grass, it will choose that grass a second time in anticipation of reexperiencing that pleasure.
[06:33:14] <tomathy> might be true
[06:33:21] <thunder> I wonder if there are any emotions which don't fit that model?
[06:33:37] <thunder> if you can think of anything that debunks it, I'm all ears.
[06:34:50] *** Quits: bosspotato (~bosspotat@user/bosspotato) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[06:34:58] <tomathy> nah i think that's probably right
[06:35:11] <tomathy> but emotions aren't everything. mos of them are kinda annoying distractions
[06:35:37] <tomathy> anger is a complicated one
[06:35:42] <tomathy> such a powerful emotion
[06:36:03] <thunder> yeah. they are a cause of disharmony within and between people though, so I think it's important to understand what's going on fundamentally in order to clarify the specifics contextually
[06:36:49] <thunder> I like to say anger comes in two forms, stubbed toe, and spilled milk.
[06:37:05] <thunder> ie. pain vs loss / fear of loss
[06:37:25] <tomathy> anger can just be a amplifying tool of effective physical action
[06:37:36] <thunder> loss is desire for that which is not present, like grief et al
[06:37:56] <tomathy> like you hit the hammer twice and miss, you get angry and hit it perfect
[06:39:15] <thunder> anger is a motivation, but people have a choice how to express it. what I find important to remember is what was my desire *before* I got angry. usually it's something beneficient. as long as my anger remains focused on that beneficient attitude, it tends not to be such a problem
[06:39:54] <thunder> the past can't be changed, but we can choose the future
[06:41:31] <thunder> and of course take instruction from the feedback
[06:45:27] <thunder> emotions I think are also a process, and as such can be repeated or interrupted intentionally to form or break habits respectively. if emotions become habitual, the original cause can become obscured so that there's no apparent "reason" for the resulting behaviours. that's a challenge to change even when you're willing to do so.
[06:46:52] <tomathy> emotion r gay
[06:47:09] <thunder> gay is an emotion
[06:49:45] <tomathy> do you meditate?
[06:49:49] <thunder> yes
[06:49:57] <thunder> various types of meditation
[06:50:17] <thunder> it's all about where and how you direct your attention
[06:50:35] <tomathy> is it possible to make an interactive website that helps people meditate?
[06:50:42] <thunder> probably
[06:50:58] <thunder> it's easier to teach newbies using ritual
[06:51:16] <thunder> assuming they can't learn from a book or just hearing someone explain the process
[06:51:56] <thunder> I find often though that working with a group in a well crafted atmosphere can be amp up the results by an order of magnitude in some situations
[06:52:20] <thunder> maybe something to do with mirror neurons. who knows.
[06:52:52] <tomathy> i like meditating

[08:19:00] <evolv> the object of meditation cannot be associated with a sensual pleasure because the point of meditation is seclusion from sensual pleasures
[08:19:11] <evolv> in Buddhism, sensual pleasures is the first of the five hindrances
[08:20:11] <evolv> jhanas cannot be attained until the 5 hindrances are abandoned, so, say, samatha meditation focuses attention on the breath object, overcoming the 5 hindrances
[08:21:21] <evolv> meditation to overcome sensual pleasures/desires has been its historical and current purpose
[08:21:43] <evolv> well, one of many, but it's always among the set
[08:23:57] <tomathy> whats a jhana and how do i get one
[08:24:33] <tomathy> evolv: i prefer the zen buddhist approach
[08:24:43] <tomathy> that meditation is good for nothing
[08:25:26] <tomathy> you cannot expect or want anything at all from it
[08:25:48] <tomathy> and even if you gain nothing from it, that shouldn't be a hindrance
[08:27:03] <tomathy> but maybe u meant that
[08:27:20] <evolv> all buddhist schools and traditions have jhana
[08:28:31] <evolv> there are four form jhanas and four formless jhanas (not called jhanas in the suttas, but done so for convenience, they're called ayatanas)
[08:28:42] <evolv> and a 9th jhana, that's nibbana
[08:28:55] <causative> there are different types of meditation with different purposes
[08:29:14] <evolv> to attain jhana is to let go of wanting something
[08:29:43] <causative> some meditation is about letting go of emotional disturbance
[08:29:49] <causative> some meditation is about cultivating love for others
[08:30:05] <causative> some meditation is about diagnosing why you feel a certain way
[08:30:40] <causative> some meditation is about thinking through a difficult decision
[08:30:59] <evolv> the last isn't a meditation technique
[08:31:09] <tomathy> some meditation is to try to emulate a character from star wars
[08:31:11] <causative> some meditation is about focusing the mind to better achieve an action
[08:31:14] <evolv> the others are connected to achieve a specific purpose
[08:31:20] <causative> they're all meditation evolv
[08:31:21] <evolv> that purpose isn't just the surface level
[08:31:32] <evolv> and they don't require sensory pleasures
[08:31:59] <causative> https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/meditate
[08:31:59] <ro-bot-o> [url] Meditate | Definition of Meditate by Merriam-Webster | www.merriam-webster.com
[08:32:06] <evolv> all meditations are focusing the mind
[08:32:14] <causative> 1 : to engage in contemplation or reflection.  "He meditated long and hard before announcing his decision."
[08:32:23] <evolv> lol
[08:32:47] <evolv> that's not meditation in the context being discussed
[08:32:57] <causative> as I said, there are different types of meditation
[08:33:21] <evolv> you cited the dictionary that uses the same term for an entirely different activity
[08:33:37] <causative> the only thing they all have in common is that they involve deliberately altering your mental state
[08:34:27] <causative> I wouldn't say all meditation is necessarily about focus either
[08:35:00] <causative> in some forms of meditation you do focus intently on a concept or thing, but in others you passively let your mind drift, thoughts coming and going like clouds
[08:35:40] <tomathy> i like object focussed meditatio
[08:35:41] <tomathy> n
[08:35:59] <causative> I don't think that "to engage in contemplation or reflection" is really that far from various forms of Buddhist meditation, either
[08:36:00] <evolv> the "focus" is not focusing so much as forcing the mind on an object, but honing in on an object for unification
[08:36:47] <evolv> to achieve jhana states, the first five of the six senses must vanish
[08:36:50] <tomathy> it's all about reaching the trance state
[08:37:10] <evolv> meditation techniques aim at dealing with those five senses in order to tackle the 6th
[08:37:17] <causative> well, not all meditation is about achieving jhana states
[08:38:03] <evolv> relaxation is the necessary pre-condition for jhana states, which any other form of meditation leads to
[08:38:08] <causative> some meditation actively stimulates the senses, e.g. one can meditate by focusing on how one is feeling or how a scene looks
[08:38:28] <tomathy> ah jhana and zen are similar ideas or the same?
[08:39:13] <causative> some meditation can be done during exercise - actually often meditation is about active focus, not relaxing
[08:39:20] <causative> some is about relaxing
[08:40:10] <tomathy> it's all a loud of codswallop
[08:40:15] <tomathy> load*
[08:40:15] <evolv> tomathy, all Buddhism has jhana (Pali), dyana (Sanskrit), because that is how Buddha achieved awakening
[08:40:30] <evolv> Zen Buddhism uses the Sanskrit dyana
[08:40:59] <tomathy> it's all bullshit
[08:41:33] <evolv> causative, you've defined meditation in such a way in that it has no meaning
[08:41:46] <tomathy> it has no meaning though
[08:41:53] <causative> the meditation I do most, is I ask myself, "how am I feeling?" and cultivate awareness of how I am feeling, without trying to change it, just observing. After some time this often makes me feel better.
[08:42:35] <evolv> you've made your mental state the meditation object
[08:42:44] <tomathy> when i meditate i think that i am anakin skywalker and how much i hate sand
[08:42:46] <causative> and physical state
[08:42:51] <causative> how I'm feeling body and mind

[08:44:21] <tomathy> try reverse meditation
[08:44:39] <tomathy> sit down and think of as much stuff as possible
[08:45:01] <tomathy> doesn't really work
[08:45:17] <tomathy> can't just spawn thoughts
[08:48:05] <tomathy> what is the purpose of the meditation object, just unity evolv ?
[08:49:13] <causative> I used to do a little of that where I would free write as fast as I could
[08:49:18] <causative> about nothing in particular
[08:49:43] <causative> just keeping my hands busy typing
[08:50:18] <causative> I think it's good to do once in a while to get out the thoughts in the back of your head

[08:50:27] <causative> but if you do it too often then you start coming up blank, or I do
[08:50:28] <evolv> tomathy, the object is the anchor, it's the one object to hold onto while letting everything else go
[08:51:08] <causative> like I'd sit for 30 minutes and just type random thoughts at 80+ wpm

[08:52:23] <tomathy> evolv: do you ever see things like sparkles or geometric strucltures? do you think we see in higher dimesnsions when we meditate well?
[08:52:31] <causative> it's good to doubt "insights" gained during meditation
[08:53:08] <causative> in meditation we think a lot of strange things and they can contradict each other - they aren't truth, they're just hypotheses
[08:53:10] <evolv> I've seen interesting things while meditating, "nimitta"
[08:54:36] <tomathy> yes i dont claim what i see is true but to deny it outright as having any significance is quite apeish imo and excessvely realistic
[08:55:23] <tomathy> i only ever saw the place of the roots of a plant sparkling when it was the object of my meditation
[08:55:27] <tomathy> never tried it properly since
[08:55:48] <causative> the brain can do all sorts of strange things that don't correspond to reality
[08:56:23] <evolv> that's what jhana is about
[08:56:30] <evolv> to learn that what we believe about reality is not reality
[08:56:39] <causative> sometimes I get the feeling that my hands are very far away - this is not reality, it's just a feeling in my brain
[08:56:50] <evolv> as we go through jhanas, we don't learn what reality is, we learn what reality is not
[08:57:18] <causative> well, *some* things we believe about reality are reality
[08:57:21] <causative> or represent reality
[08:57:26] <evolv> maybe
[08:57:32] <causative> e.g. the stuff around you is made of atoms
[08:57:39] <causative> that's reality
[08:57:45] <evolv> no, it's a model
[08:57:56] <causative> no, the model is different from what is modeled
[08:58:11] <causative> the model is in your head, the stuff around you is not in your head
[08:58:12] <evolv> an atom is just another fabrication
[08:58:19] <causative> no, it's a thing outside your head
[08:58:22] <evolv> hence subatomic particles
[08:58:30] <causative> those are also things
[08:58:37] <causative> things can be made of smaller things
[08:59:10] <evolv> so the atom isn't really a thing, it's a circle drawn over collective properties temporarly associated
[08:59:29] <evolv> it becomes a thing because of limited perspective of reality, it appears as an object, it's a model
[08:59:34] <causative> the atom is not the circle, the atom is what the circle refers to
[08:59:37] <evolv> much like what a human is
[08:59:42] <causative> when I point, I am not pointing at my finger
[09:00:10] <evolv> a human is an object, it's a model of what a human is, when we see a human as a object, we don't see reality as it is
[09:00:21] <causative> an object is not a model of an object
[09:00:25] *** Joins: Leonarbro (~Leonet@user/leonarbro)
[09:00:37] <evolv> all objects are fabrications
[09:00:42] <causative> we - humans - draw a circle around some properties and associate them and call them an "atom." This circle is not the atom. It refers to the atom. The actual atom is out there, *not* in our heads
[09:00:45] <evolv> objects are empty
[09:01:03] <causative> the territory is not the map
[09:01:20] <causative> the concepts and models are in the map - and they represent real things in the territory that are not concepts or models
[09:01:56] <evolv> and you operate under the assumption you know what is real
[09:01:58] <Panther> some ppl have empty heads.
[09:02:14] <evolv> yet, even in science, the hypothesis testing is learning what is not
[09:02:18] <evolv> hence falsification
[09:02:22] <evolv> not verification
[09:02:40] <Panther> That's what power is for.
[09:02:42] <evolv> it took until Popper for science to catch up to Buddhism
[09:03:02] <evolv> except the whole materialism thing
[09:03:14] <causative> falsification *and* verification are important - take the Bayesian perspective
[09:03:22] <Panther> i.e. the complement of making a type ii error.
[09:03:27] <causative> sometimes evidence decreases the probability of a hypothesis, sometimes evidence increases the probability of the hypothesis
[09:03:36] <causative> the former is falsification, the latter is verification
[09:03:38] <evolv> so we're back to models
[09:03:51] <causative> as long as you do not confuse your finger with the moon
[09:04:14] <causative> the finger is the model, the moon is what the model represents
[09:04:45] <causative> don't look at the moon and say it's only a finger
[09:05:02] <evolv> don't look at the moon and say it's a moon
[09:05:11] <causative> it's not a finger
[09:05:12] <evolv> you got to go further
[09:05:25] <evolv> yes, knowing what is not reality
[09:05:35] <evolv> but there is still the issue if the moon is reality
[09:05:41] <causative> when I say "it is a moon" I am doing the same thing as pointing at it with my finger, to refer to it
[09:05:41] <evolv> the finger is not the moon
[09:05:50] <causative> the claim "it is a moon" is not a moon
[09:05:50] <evolv> but is the moon the moon?
[09:06:04] <causative> yes
[09:06:13] <evolv> or is it someone else's finger?
[09:06:18] <causative> that's the law of identity
[09:06:26] <causative> no, the moon is not someone else's finger
[09:07:11] <Panther> I am glad of that,, every time they moved their hand, the tides would change :(
[09:07:41] <evolv> and, again, verificationism is not science
[09:08:01] <causative> falsification is *more important* in science than verification - but both are important
[09:08:03] <evolv> the result of scientific investigation is a model
[09:08:07] * Panther is a Panther
[09:08:11] <causative> in science there are confirmations as well as falsifications
[09:08:12] <evolv> there is no verification in science
[09:08:31] <causative> confirmation is when a theory makes a prediction, and the prediction in fact occurs
[09:08:53] * tomathy is a string of text
[09:08:57] <causative> for example, when general relativity predicted gravity would bend light, and it was observed to do so, by the amount predicted
[09:09:02] <causative> that was confirmation
[09:09:25] <causative> general relativity became more likely as a result of that observation
[09:09:25] <evolv> by failing to falsifying the hypothesis
[09:09:37] <causative> yes, failing to falsify usually confirms
[09:09:51] <causative> the only alternative would be if evidence had no effect one way or another on the plausibility of the hypothesis
[09:10:09] <evolv> thus, by utility of a model that repeatedly fails falsification, we render it as true
[09:10:10] <causative> evidence either falsifies, confirms, or is indifferent, with respect to a hypothesis
[09:10:29] <evolv> the model, however, is not known to be true
[09:10:35] <causative> why give primacy to just the first, when there are three possibilities?
[09:10:57] <causative> of course, nothing is known with certainty
[09:11:09] <causative> confirmation is always relative and partial
[09:11:15] <causative> so is falsification
[09:11:27] <evolv> because of the danger in replacing the real with the model
[09:11:32] <causative> a theory is never conclusively known to be false
[09:11:37] <causative> not with perfect certainty
[09:11:40] <evolv> the model can change, often does
[09:12:08] <evolv> this is how we maintain a healthy relationship with a model, especially a good one
[09:12:25] <causative> well, it is good to always doubt
[09:12:31] <Panther> I don't have that problem, because my life is based on axioms, just like mathematics. In fact there is just one axiom, suitably called Axiom 1. :)
[09:12:46] <causative> but doubting does not mean we must adopt a one-sided view of science, where the only thing that matters is falsification
[09:12:49] <Panther> Axiom 1 states that I am always right.
[09:12:56] *** Quits: MrReader (~Crown@user/mrreader) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[09:13:02] <causative> evidence can go either way
[09:13:05] <causative> for or against
[09:13:07] <Panther> Once that becomes clear, then everything is much simpler.
[09:13:35] <evolv> but the issue with all of this is confusion of what we determine to be reality is because of science, like the mind originating from the brain
[09:13:52] <evolv> this isn't because of science, this is simply the principle of parsimony
[09:14:09] * Panther likes parsimonious models.
[09:14:11] <causative> well, the mind does originate from the brain
[09:14:17] <evolv> it does not
[09:14:41] <evolv> at least science has not provided sufficient evidence to conclude it
[09:15:08] <causative> science has provided sufficient evidence that the burden of proof for some mysterious souls explaining our minds, is on the person claiming there are souls
[09:15:10] <evolv> this is not a conclusion from evidence, but from the principle of parsimony. All we know is there is a correlation between mind and brain
[09:15:41] <causative> science has shown how it is plausible for the mind to result from the brain, and from there, parsimony says that we should not imagine a mystical soul when it does not appear necessary
[09:15:51] <evolv> a soul is another model, but a mind separate from body does not necessitate souls
[09:16:09] <causative> well whatever you call a mind separate from a body, it's a soul
[09:16:23] <causative> maybe you want to use a different word but it's a soul
[09:16:23] <evolv> no, it is not
[09:16:25] <evolv> it is mind
[09:16:43] <causative> it's an unnecessary assumption
[09:16:48] <causative> an extra entity we don't need
[09:17:12] <causative> like the lumeniferous aether
[09:17:14] <evolv> or science is limited by its own assumptions and tools when there are other empirical approaches, like meditation leading to jhana states
[09:17:26] <evolv> which are replicable
[09:17:53] <causative> meditation is useful and valuable, but religion has a long history of altered mental states and implausible claims made about them
[09:17:56] <causative> for example, prophecy
[09:18:09] <causative> God or Jesus coming to people in a dream
[09:18:11] <Panther> and magic mushrooms
[09:18:23] <evolv> I'm sure you wouldn't care for the same argument made of science
[09:18:45] <causative> science has a long history of advancing towards the truth and rejecting false ideas
[09:19:04] <causative> science is a proven successful method of searching for the truth

[09:19:49] <evolv> p-hacking
[09:20:12] <causative> it is useful at finding the truth with flaws, sure, and that's *an incredibly high standard*, one not met by any religion
[09:20:27] <evolv> it is useful, it also creates fictions, too
[09:20:39] <evolv> at some indefinite period of time, some truth wins, whenever that may be
[09:20:42] <causative> yes, it is not perfect, but it is *good*
[09:20:48] <causative> it is *good* at finding the truth
[09:20:52] <causative> this is not true of religions
[09:20:59] <evolv> we just know at some point, and we disregard that other science and praise current science

[09:21:26] <causative> I am using "good" in the sense of "effective" here, tomathy
[09:21:44] <causative> although I would also say science is morally good, that's another story
[09:21:46] <tomathy> say effective because you sound like a dark priest of magic
[09:21:49] * Panther has been a scientist for 50 years.
[09:22:00] <evolv> the amount of actual published science that has amounted to actual utility is a small percentage, too
[09:22:07] <causative> it is morally good that we cure disease and enlighten ourselves about how the universe works
[09:22:21] <tomathy> maybe we just cure the king or queen though
[09:22:44] <tomathy> maybe we genocide the indians with smallpox
[09:22:50] <evolv> there isn't even a standard practice of science
[09:22:50] <causative> maybe we revolutionize the world and increase the standard of living for almost everyone
[09:22:59] <evolv> we have a general "scientific method"
[09:23:12] <evolv> but how science is conducted is a huge gradient that is niche dependent
[09:23:17] <causative> the standard of living around the world is good now tomathy - better than it was
[09:23:27] <evolv> which ultimately amounts to rituals copying what is done in other publications
[09:23:32] <causative> people around the world, even in the "third world," are now living longer, not dying in childhood, having smaller families, having more education
[09:23:44] <tomathy> causative: not for those indians who died of smallpox or the jews in ww2 nazi science experiments
[09:23:50] <evolv> which is the metric whether the science is performed right by reviewers. Defending a new method is quite difficult
[09:24:06] <causative> tomathy, and do you think what you said refutes what I said?
[09:24:15] <Panther> And soon they will have Internet too, so there will be more consumers for unneccesary goods and services.
[09:24:16] <tomathy> causative: that science is morally good, yes
[09:24:25] <evolv> so we're at an age where the religions are replaced by, yet, another religion we call science
[09:24:30] <causative> does the fact that Indians died of smallpox mean that the standard of living around the world has not drastically improved?
[09:24:34] <evolv> because science yields some fruits, as did the religions
[09:24:35] <causative> because it has

[09:26:20] * tomathy raises his staff to heaven and calls upon the name of the Lord
[09:26:29] <causative> you need a sense of scale for these things
[09:26:42] <evolv> yeah, like climate change
[09:27:05] <causative> well, that is a global problem, but we'll see
[09:27:09] <evolv> an outcome of modernity, modernity an outcome of industrialization which is an outcome of science and engineering
[09:27:30] <evolv> these problems are, of course, not the fault of science, itself
[09:27:41] <evolv> as with anything, they fault lies with our relationships
[09:27:50] <causative> science at least gives us a chance to reach for the stars, instead of muddling in the bronze age until the sun goes out
[09:28:19] <causative> it's better to have the chance to succeed as a species and become something greater, even if it kills us all, than to hide in ignorance forever
[09:28:31] <evolv> but when asked why reach for the stars, there is no meaningful answer
[09:28:42] <causative> for truth
[09:28:59] <causative> to understand the universe and our place in it
[09:28:59] <evolv> the truth lies with the stars?
[09:29:08] <causative> the truth lies everywhere, including with the stars
[09:29:13] <evolv> so our place in the universe has a reason?
[09:29:31] <causative> it takes a very advanced civilization to investigate the truth - odds are a lot better if it is an interstellar civilization
[09:29:46] <evolv> this is very spiritual talk to me
[09:29:54] <causative> and if humanity does spread beyond a single planet, we won't go extinct, not for billions of years
[09:30:01] <evolv> all human endeavors turn to the spiritual. Transcendence
[09:30:04] <evolv> Science no different
[09:30:11] <evolv> political ideologies no different
[09:30:24] <evolv> all paths humans take to achieve transcendence
[09:30:33] <evolv> from an existence lived that is wholly unsatisfactory
[09:30:34] <causative> yes, truth is a spiritual pursuit, except for the fact that there is no such thing as a "spirit"
[09:30:41] <causative> or you could say all is spirit
[09:30:56] <evolv> spiritual is not intended to mean "spirit" as in "soul"
[09:31:07] <causative> all is subatomic particles, maybe atoms are spirit
[09:31:32] <evolv> or there are no particles
[09:31:36] <evolv> just a particle
[09:31:43] <evolv> akin to the one electron hypothesis
[09:31:51] <causative> we're pretty confident about the particles
[09:32:03] <evolv> there is some evidence for the one electron hypothesis
[09:32:25] <evolv> not enough to be convincing
[09:32:30] <evolv> but enough to be interesting
[09:32:38] <causative> the one electron hypothesis is a bit of whimsy only made possible by positrons
[09:33:26] <causative> anyway, even if it's true, it doesn't mean there aren't many electrons
[09:33:27] <evolv> we're always at a point in time where science is considered rather mature, especially on specific subjects of interest
[09:33:41] <evolv> then with enough time, our totally true model collapses for something even cooler
[09:33:46] <evolv> more insane
[09:34:03] <evolv> unti it becomes mundane, totally obvious, verified
[09:34:06] <causative> if the one electron hypothesis is true, it is only one electron by a certain way of counting - it's still many electrons if you count a slice at a particular time
[09:34:09] <evolv> that is the nature of models

[09:34:27] <ro-bot-o> [url] Isaac Asimov | web.williams.edu
[09:34:31] <causative> read that if you haven't
[09:34:37] <causative> it addresses what you just said
[09:35:05] <evolv> I'm not going to read Asimov
[09:35:05] <causative> "John, when people thought the earth was flat, they were wrong. When people thought the earth was spherical, they were wrong. But if you think that thinking the earth is spherical is just as wrong as thinking the earth is flat, then your view is wronger than both of them put together."
[09:35:19] <causative> why aren't you going to read Asimov?
[09:35:32] <evolv> because of dumb quotes like that
[09:35:51] <evolv> while true, is not the point being made here
[09:36:23] <causative> it seems like it addresses exactly the point you made
[09:36:33] <evolv> no, it's not a matter of equally false
[09:36:34] <causative> <evolv> then with enough time, our totally true model collapses for something even cooler
[09:36:47] <tomathy> im bored of the arguing
[09:36:50] <causative> you're speaking as if science does not advance because it abandons models for newer ones
[09:37:11] <causative> the point of the article - which is a very good one that you should read - is that science abandons models for newer ones that are incrementally better
[09:37:21] <causative> the old models aren't totally wrong, they're mostly right
[09:37:25] <evolv> I'm speaking of the incompleteness of models
[09:37:28] <causative> but the newer ones are just even better
[09:37:39] <causative> models may be incomplete but they can still be very good, and get better over time, which happens in science
[09:37:45] <evolv> what do we care about?
[09:37:55] <tomathy> why dont you get to the meat of the debate, you are debating objective reality vs subjective
[09:38:11] <evolv> that a model is equivalent to the real, or that the model is good enough for something?
[09:38:46] <causative> the models are not the same as what is real, but they can still name entities that are real
[09:39:00] <causative> for example, the earth is not a sphere, but the spherical earth model does name the earth, which is real
[09:39:12] <evolv> a model's utility may reflect what is real, but may be wholly unreal
[09:39:18] <causative> the flaw in the model there is not in the existence of the entities, but in their fine properties
[09:39:20] <tomathy> a model is a model is a model
[09:39:26] <evolv> it's not the model that is important
[09:39:34] <evolv> not for the sake of it standing in for the real
[09:39:42] <causative> the real question is whether and how the model meaningfully refers to the world
[09:39:51] <causative> which scientific models are quite good at doing
[09:39:53] <evolv> or let's get at the truth
[09:40:04] <evolv> it's what the models can do for us to attain some desire
[09:40:23] <causative> well, that's close to pragmatism
[09:40:37] <causative> what is true?  "what is true is what assumptions help me achieve my goals"
[09:41:11] <causative> it's not completely acceptable to me as a theory of truth, but I would say it is the *origin* of truth
[09:41:28] <causative> that humans evolved truth-seeking mental mechanisms, precisely because such mechanisms helped us achieve the goal of reproducing
[09:41:52] <evolv> goal is an interesting word
[09:42:06] <evolv> reproducing is an outcome, but a goal for whom?
[09:42:06] <causative> a very valuable word
[09:42:25] <causative> everywhere in nature you find minimization or maximization principles
[09:42:33] <evolv> a goal is intentional
[09:42:40] <evolv> how much of reproduction occurs with intent?
[09:42:58] <evolv> or do you believe in a cosmic intent?
[09:42:59] <causative> we can program goals into artificial intelligences, and have them seek the goals
[09:43:03] <causative> is the AI doing so intentionally?
[09:43:35] <causative> we can say, without much confusion, that the AI is optimizing for something - optimizing what we told it to optimize
[09:43:45] <evolv> in this example, we are the gods
[09:43:50] <evolv> I imagine you don't want to invoke gods
[09:43:53] <causative> there are no gods
[09:43:54] <tomathy> im not
[09:44:05] <causative> rather say we are the parents
[09:44:09] <causative> the AI, the child
[09:44:10] <evolv> so you have to find an analogy that doesn't invoke will
[09:44:28] <evolv> that is what "goal" often intends to mean
[09:44:30] <causative> a soap bubble takes a shape according to an optimization principle
[09:44:51] <evolv> a desire achieved by will and intent
[09:44:55] <causative> a ball when thrown takes a path according to the principle of least action, which is an optimization principle
[09:45:06] <causative> optimization is everywhere in nature
[09:45:11] <causative> and in our artificial creations, and in our own minds
[09:45:44] <causative> I think it is not overly confusing to say that optimization is goal-seeking, and that a goal is the condition that is optimized for
[09:46:46] <causative> optimization objective, goal, want, desire - these are essentially synonymous
[09:46:57] <evolv> so, given evolutionary biology is my area of expertise, what best describes human evolution would be the same with anything else in evolution
[09:47:01] <causative> or at least it does not cause much confusion to define them as synonymous
[09:47:01] <evolv> it was "good enough"
[09:47:31] *** Joins: qu4nt1n (~qu4nt1n@78.198.214.34)
[09:47:44] <evolv> for even the mind models reality
[09:47:50] <causative> well, there's good enough but there's always better and worse
[09:48:14] <causative> if a mutation helps an organism reproduce at a higher rate than its peers, then that organism will soon dominate and proliferate
[09:48:29] <evolv> not really true
[09:48:49] <causative> how can it be doubted?
[09:48:52] <evolv> resources
[09:49:24] <causative> what, that the population would collapse because they run out of resources?
[09:49:57] <thunder> left-field thought here. I was thinking about love and it's special status as a sentiment. it stikes me that love is held so sacred because it is one of the few ways in which we can transmute pain into pleasure. as a complex/nuanced emotional frame it allows is to recontextualize our pain according to a set of higher transcendent values such as tolerance, patience, loyalty, faithfulness and self-sacrifice.
[09:50:00] <causative> the faster-reproducing organism still has a comparative advantage over its peers, by assumption, so if the population collapses it's still dominated as much as it could
[09:50:10] <causative> anyway this is getting far afield
[09:50:16] <evolv> reproducing two offspring given rich resources that develop various skills will, on average, have greater fitness
[09:50:50] <causative> the point is that we evolved to seek the truth because the truth was useful to our reproductive fitness
[09:51:02] <causative> and that this is the origin of our truth-seeking mechanisms
[09:51:12] <evolv> reproduction by sheer numbers is another strategy that works better in resource scarce situations. Some of those offspring may survive long enough, be attractive enough, etc. to reproduce
[09:51:52] <causative> when I talked about a mutation that made an individual reproduce faster, evolv , I was speaking ceteris paribus
[09:51:57] <evolv> and while we evolved in this way, there are bacteria
[09:52:06] <thunder> evolv: would you not say metaphorically that the goal of lightening is to follow the path of least resistance across a voltage gradient?
[09:52:09] <causative> we do not assume the faster-reproducing individual is lesser in other ways
[09:52:33] <evolv> we have a bunch of models to account for fitness
[09:52:44] <evolv> look into population genetics
[09:52:46] <causative> not that it is smaller, or that it is less capable in a variety of environments, or that it is less intelligent
[09:52:57] <evolv> seriously, you may find it interesting
[09:52:58] <causative> ceteris paribus - all those other factors the same, just reproduction rate is higher
[09:53:03] <evolv> evolution is messy
[09:53:25] <thunder> or perhaps better said, to lower the entropy of the system
[09:53:40] <thunder> sorry raise
[09:53:59] <evolv> truth seeking may be a byproduct of other factors
[09:54:23] <causative> I don't think so - even a mouse has truth-seeking mechanisms
[09:54:28] <causative> even a cockroach has them
[09:54:30] <thunder> isn't truth simply a consistent/congruent context of a set of the submeanings?
[09:54:33] <causative> truth is useful
[09:54:43] <causative> if you know where the food is - that's truth - you can get the food - that's useful
[09:54:50] <evolv> and we're back to models
[09:55:02] <evolv> "good enough"
[09:55:03] <thunder> like truth in the context of chess would be moving the pieces according to the game rules
[09:55:11] <evolv> truth only when it's "good enough"
[09:55:18] <causative> remember what I said earlier
[09:55:31] <evolv> you're forgetting the most important key ingredients
[09:55:34] <evolv> creativity, ingenuity
[09:55:41] <causative> <causative> what is true?  "what is true is what assumptions help me achieve my goals"
[09:55:41] <causative> <causative> it's not completely acceptable to me as a theory of truth, but I would say it is the *origin* of truth
[09:56:00] <causative> so I'm not saying, here, that truth is entirely encapsulated by utility to the organism
[09:56:06] <causative> but that we seek truth *because* of this utility
[09:56:21] <evolv> but we really seek truth to be entertained
[09:56:32] <thunder> how do people form conspiracy theories or other delusional beliefs? to them it must seem true in some sense, whether it's deemed objectively so or not. what leads to that sense of truth?
[09:57:04] <evolv> not to serve any actual purpose, but because we can't figure out how to deal with our unsatisfactory lives as we choose to live them
[09:57:19] <evolv> when we have the resources to live comfortably and long, we're bored
[09:57:24] <causative> could be the other way around, perhaps we require entertainment because we have so much cognitive capacity we have to occupy it somehow or it breaks down
[09:57:27] <evolv> we seek truth to defeat boredom
[09:57:29] <causative> anteaters don't require entertainment
[09:57:39] <causative> do unintelligent animals get bored?
[09:57:44] <evolv> what entertains them may be beyond our understanding
[09:57:54] <evolv> like when a dog is having a ball sniffing the grass
[09:58:20] <thunder> apparently if e-coli are given a rich but non-diverse food source, they will eventually opt to abandon it in favour of less rich food which has greater nutrient diversity
[09:58:22] <evolv> we can't sniff the grass and be entertained
[09:58:31] <causative> not every animal requires entertainment to the same degree, and generally the more intelligent animals, like chimps, dogs, dolphins, are also the more playful ones who demand more entertainment
[09:58:53] <evolv> the more social ones demand more entertainment
[09:59:00] <thunder> I think that e-coli behaviour could be analogous to why people grow bored even though their needs are ostensibly met
[09:59:06] <causative> an alligator does nothing for entertainment
[09:59:14] <evolv> how can you know?
[09:59:27] <evolv> that isn't known to science
[09:59:33] <evolv> truth by guess
[09:59:46] <causative> I think it's a good guess
[09:59:58] <evolv> I lack of investigation because of married to your models of reality. It feels true, thus it must be true
[10:00:17] <evolv> when the models of the real substitute for the real, creating a fabricated reality
[10:00:23] <thunder> you should read nagel before supposing what an alligator does or why
[10:00:53] <causative> I've never heard of an alligator doing anything for fun
[10:01:10] <causative> they're dumb animals, reflex machines
[10:01:12] <thunder> how many alligators or alligator enthusiasts have you encountered?
[10:01:31] <evolv> how can we determine what is fun for an alligator?
[10:01:42] <thunder> to some people doing their tax returns is fun. whatever floats you goat.
[10:01:45] <evolv> it's more heuristics
[10:01:56] <causative> well, look at what the alligator does and see if there is an obvious evolutionary purpose to it
[10:02:11] <thunder> what's the evolutionary purpose of fun?
[10:02:11] <evolv> the closer the animal behaviors resemble ours, the more we can readily assume what their behaviors mean to them
[10:02:42] <causative> an alligator mostly just sits around, there aren't many behaviors that *could* be fun
[10:02:50] <causative> when it's not sitting around it's probably eating
[10:02:54] <evolv> like meditating
[10:02:58] <evolv> sitting down, eyes closed
[10:03:01] <evolv> yet blissed the fuck out
[10:03:02] <evolv> :D
[10:03:09] <thunder> in the field of animal cognition they've basically determined that the majority of animals have physiological and neurological system analogous to humans which react according to similar stimuli. so if we feel a certain way, there's a good chance animals do also.
[10:03:15] <causative> well, sure, but that's not boredom or the need for entertainment
[10:03:21] <causative> it's not "fun" in the sense we were talking about
[10:03:26] <evolv> entertainment isn't a need
[10:03:31] <thunder> really?
[10:03:40] <thunder> I'd dispute that
[10:04:01] <evolv> this is why we must investigate what is not reality and challenge ourselves to go further
[10:04:19] <thunder> like if you place someone in solitary confinement and provide for their rest and nutrition, they will still go insane and liable to suicide
[10:04:32] <evolv> otherwise we end up with incorrect understanding of needs
[10:04:53] <causative> yeah, I suspect that humans need entertainment because our big complicated brains need maintenance
[10:05:00] <evolv> or hold place a strange importance on entertainment and random goals to the stars

[10:06:53] <thunder> human beings are meaning making machines. we instinctively project meaning onto the world and search for it even where it may not exist as such.
[10:07:01] <evolv> it's not all that important to know how the paperclip ended up on the floor from the desk
[10:07:16] <evolv> we'd pick it up and moved on. We'd not investigate the truth in the matter
[10:07:29] <causative> that depends on how the paperclip ended up on the floor from the desk
[10:07:44] <causative> could be something important
[10:07:53] <causative> probably not, but maybe
[10:08:15] <causative> could be a corporate spy who bumped it while he was looking through your computer for secrets and passwords
[10:08:16] <thunder> pareidolia/apophenia is interesting in that regard. it seems to me like an evolutionary development for detecting predators and potential mates.
[10:08:44] <causative> truth is important at least to the extent it guides our actions
[10:08:48] <thunder> like the predator hidden in the bushes for instance
[10:09:08] <causative> we should not be confident that our actions are right, when we don't know all possibly relevant truths
[10:09:26] <causative> by finding more truth, therefore, we guide ourselves to more right and more moral actions
[10:09:59] <evolv> this is all some abstract truth being worshipped religiously
[10:10:05] <evolv> but with no real understanding
[10:10:05] <causative> truth is a prerequisite to morality - and empathy is a form of truth
[10:10:12] <thunder> right according to what metric. for a knight on a chess board, what is right is to move 2 squares ahead and 1 to the side.

[10:11:06] <causative> by this I mean, tell me my current best definition of what truth is
[10:11:14] <evolv> causative, I aim to know how to no longer suffer
[10:11:45] <evolv> everything can be reduced to life, as we choose to live it, is unsatisfactory
[10:12:08] <causative> well, if you don't buy into the Buddhist notion of reincarnation, death is sufficient to end suffering
[10:12:13] <evolv> we are stressed, experience a lot of pain and grief, suffer. There are many good times, but the bad times taint it
[10:12:26] <evolv> so, what is the most important thing? To end suffering
[10:12:30] <causative> I don't think so

[10:12:43] <causative> it is better to suffer, and to know, than to have bliss and ignorance
[10:12:45] <thunder> I think truth is a framework in which all context of meaning falling within it is coherent and non-contradicting. unlike computing it doesn't have to halt per se, except insofar as it naturally will upon our demise.
[10:13:04] <causative> we evolved suffering to guide us away from things that could hurt us
[10:13:17] <causative> it's useful
[10:13:26] <evolv> "hurt us"
[10:13:34] <causative> reduce our reproductive fitness
[10:13:37] <evolv> that's all part of the ending suffering dilemma
[10:13:55] <evolv> we suffer to prevent suffering lol
[10:13:58] <causative> I mean "hurt" there in the sense of "damage"
[10:13:59] <evolv> kind of silly
[10:14:01] <causative> not "suffering"
[10:14:13] <evolv> damage is suffering
[10:14:15] <causative> we evolved suffering to guide us away from things that could damage our bodies
[10:14:19] <causative> damage is not always suffering
[10:14:19] <evolv> not reproducing isn't suffering
[10:14:29] <evolv> it isn't damage
[10:14:32] <causative> if you are nerveless, then damage is not suffering
[10:14:40] <causative> damage leads to not reproducing
[10:14:45] <causative> this is why we evolved pain
[10:15:19] <thunder> I practice iron fist (ie. wolff's law). that's a good example. pain is not injury. it's just the warning that injury is imminent.

[10:15:39] <evolv> you live by the model as if it is real, and reality must match your model
[10:16:05] <evolv> this makes sense to you because there is some comfort, some level of control, in a reality that feels, essentially, meaningless to you
[10:16:08] <evolv> meaningless, chaotic
[10:16:19] <causative> you're projecting
[10:16:23] <causative> I don't think reality is meaningless
[10:16:35] <causative> I mentioned the importance of truth as a way to guide us to right action
[10:16:52] <causative> and I described how I think nature is full of optimization principles, which I see as equivalent to human desires or goals
[10:17:04] <evolv> the right action is to seek more truth? To reproduce?
[10:17:07] <evolv> to do what?
[10:17:11] <evolv> die a bit later?
[10:17:12] <causative> I don't know what the right action is
[10:17:25] <causative> I would need to find out more truth, to know what the right action is
[10:17:32] <thunder> causative: if a conspiracy theorist has a rule set they are working with, and all the pieces of information they've collected thus far fall within it's pervue in a coherent/consistent manner, does that not make it true (for them)?
[10:17:37] <causative> so for now, the right action is to find out more truth, in hopes of eventually finding out what the real right action is
[10:18:25] <causative> but I think the pursuit of truth is probably an end
[10:18:27] <evolv> the purpose of truth is to learn what the right action is, which you want to know because then something will happen that causes life to be..?
[10:18:43] <thunder> I tend to think doubt is custodian of truth, in the sense that the set of rules I'm working with must conform to the information not the other way around.
[10:18:45] <evolv> and if all truth is known completely and entirely, then what?
[10:18:53] <causative> all truth cannot be known completely and entirely
[10:19:12] <evolv> that's another guess
[10:19:21] <evolv> another hit to science
[10:19:29] <causative> well, there's the church-turing thesis
[10:19:32] <evolv> turns out some truths are more important than the ones science obtains
[10:19:36] <causative> and the halting problem
[10:19:40] <thunder> it's amazing to think that when you look up into the heavens, that whole broad expanses is really just a projection created in the confines of your skull.
[10:19:59] <thunder> reconstituted from sensory stimuli
[10:20:06] <evolv> thunder, yes, a hallucination
[10:20:08] <causative> even if we solve the halting problem with an oracle, such oracle machines still have their truths that are unprovable
[10:20:39] <causative> anyway I think that truth itself is a valuable end goal
[10:21:04] * Ungwelian sighs
[10:21:08] <causative> to create more awareness, to order the world in accordance with that awareness
[10:21:12] <Ungwelian> Why this contempt at human senses?
[10:21:28] <causative> morality is ultimately a question of how to order the world
[10:21:44] <thunder> I think understanding that some things can never be known, is part of having maturity of knowledge. another way to put it is "ignorance is custodian of knowledge"
[10:22:06] <thunder> it breeds humility
[10:22:57] <causative> why does a human have more moral value than a cogwheel?
[10:22:58] <thunder> Ungwelian: it's a medical science perspective. I don't limit my perspective to that alone, but it does give me a chuckle to think about
[10:23:04] <causative> moral value comes from awareness
[10:23:11] <causative> humans have more moral value because we are more aware
[10:23:17] <thunder> ever heard of the sator-rotas square?
[10:23:32] <thunder> speaking of wheels
[10:23:45] <causative> if something has more moral value than a human, that thing would be more aware than the human
[10:23:46] <thunder> never mind ptolemy
[10:24:27] <causative> pleasure and suffering are secondary
[10:25:08] <thunder> I don't think moral value has any context absent pain/pleasure
[10:25:24] <Ungwelian> thunder, there's meteorology too. You can see skies and from that derive truthfully how they function.
[10:25:25] <thunder> it's a human response to it
[10:25:29] <causative> imagine everyone could turn on or off their pain/pleasure responses at will
[10:25:35] <causative> I wouldn't turn my pain off
[10:25:36] <causative> I'd still want it
[10:25:49] <causative> unless it was harmful to me in a certain circumstance
[10:26:03] <causative> I'd want the pain so that I wouldn't damage myself too much
[10:26:21] <causative> so morality would still be meaningful there
[10:27:14] <causative> moral value is about desire, or goals.  Pain and pleasure are *important* for motivating our desires, but not the only thing.
[10:27:45] <thunder> Ungwelian: yeah. meteorlogy is a system where all bodies operating within it's rule set are consistent/coherent/congruent, and thus we can extrapolate from past experience what will happen in the future based on those patterns. but knowing meteorology won't necessarily improve your apple pie recipe

[10:30:41] <thunder> pleasure comes in many varieties. its diversity is more important than it's quantity.
[10:30:59] <causative> very well, the button could make you feel a diversity of pleasures
[10:31:09] <thunder> it's also rich, composed of a variety of confluent contexts

[10:31:47] <thunder> if you remove the ability to form new experiences or appreciate past ones, you remove the pleasure that goes with them
[10:32:31] <causative> so you're redefining happiness so as to tell me that a drooling idiot by definition cannot be happy?
[10:32:47] <thunder> I wouldn't do it, because the pleasure of not being a drooling idiot outweighs (is indispensible from) appreciating the pleasure. it's not just a sensation. it's a state of mind.

[10:33:33] <causative> if you admit that armadillos can feel happiness, then you would too after pressing the button
[10:33:49] <thunder> that's like saying, I'll give you a shiny new car of the exact model you want, but it won't have wheels or an engine.

[10:35:05] <causative> I would not press the button because to become a drooling idiot is simply another form of death - the person that would live on, after pressing the button, would not be me, because they would not have my awareness, my truth. It the truth of my experiences and ideas that matters to me, pain or pleasure secondary.
[10:35:24] <thunder> perhaps that's true. but what I'm saying is happiness is continguent. sometimes you can't have the one without the other. it's not just a physiological stimulus. it's a rich state of mind which is heavily entwined with free will (imo)
[10:37:09] <thunder> some people might answer yes to your question without hesitation. I wouldn't doubt it. people find oblivion of death preferable all the time, even when they otherwise want for nothing.

[10:55:29] <thunder> I was thinking causative about the idea of an effective process for determining truth. if truth can be taken to mean consistency of observed phenomena within the context of a given rule set, then it is only relevant within a limited domain. but perhaps there is an innate sense of pleasure (like gratification) associated with having this sense of consistency, and having it validated relative to others, which allows the pleasure inherent to truth to
[10:55:29] <thunder> supercede the immediate experience of pain or toil involved in the effective process of finding it..
[10:58:37] <thunder> I personally feel pleasure when I find a novel way to reconcile what seem like contradictory truths. usually this requires going outside the domain of either ruleset and finding some other more abstractly conjoining criterion by which to compare them.
[10:59:44] <thunder> for instance the ability to entertain both atheistic and theistic perspectives without necessarily having to "believe in" either to the exclusion of the other.

[18:56:54] <biys> no
[18:56:58] <biys> they're calling you a troll
[18:57:06] <biys> cause everyone knows you'er a troll
[18:57:06] <I_Am_M00t> anyway, whatevs, the other dude was clearly just being racist
[18:57:24] <biys> you're attempting now to appeal to authority to have a ban take place
[18:57:33] <I_Am_M00t> i think you're the troll biys :), i just tease people when they try to get away with nonsense
[18:57:57] <biys> you would say that

[18:59:14] <biys> sure, i get that
[18:59:24] <I_Am_M00t> apparently not
[18:59:24] <biys> and if the moderators see it and take action whatever

[18:59:39] <biys> eggshell skull perhaps?
[18:59:53] <I_Am_M00t> lol, another contradiction from you, because had you gotten that , you wouldnt claim that it was an appeal to authority
[19:00:10] <biys> i would never attempt to appeal to authority to have my chats moderated
[19:00:12] <I_Am_M00t> you're full of contradictions
[19:00:21] <I_Am_M00t> :) nice try

[19:00:32] <I_Am_M00t> good for you

[19:01:28] <I_Am_M00t> fascist? :)
[19:01:30] <I_Am_M00t> aww
[19:01:33] <biys> yah
[19:01:38] <I_Am_M00t> awww, how so
[19:01:49] <biys> you're always telling people how they're supposed to think, what they're supposed to feel, how they're supposed to act

[19:02:00] <I_Am_M00t> aww biys
[19:02:28] <I_Am_M00t> am i telling you how to think? when you're the one trying to convince everyone that Christianity is the way?
[19:02:44] <biys> and i mean... if i took the time to copy and paste any of the chats you direct at Leeloo in here at any point in time
[19:02:50] <biys> i'm sure everyone would realize you're a liar
[19:03:05] <I_Am_M00t> :) nope, i think those things
[19:03:14] <biys> so please.  appeal to authority on the guise of making the world a better place
[19:03:22] <biys> whilst you attack leeloo you transphobe
[19:03:27] <I_Am_M00t> it's not an appeal to authority, again
[19:03:44] <I_Am_M00t> nope, now you're making things up

[19:03:51] <biys> i bet

[19:04:12] <I_Am_M00t> go for it
[19:05:01] <I_Am_M00t> so, any more logical contradictions from you?
[19:05:22] <biys> idk.  tell me about how you hate racism while you make fun of a transgender person pretty much any chance you get
[19:05:28] <biys> then tell me where the logical contradiction is
[19:05:58] <I_Am_M00t> i support transgenderism, I don't support her views
[19:06:03] <I_Am_M00t> that's the distinction
[19:06:30] <biys> i would say the proof is in the pudding kiddo
[19:06:44] <I_Am_M00t> nope, i support transgenderism
[19:06:50] <I_Am_M00t> that's just how it is
[19:06:59] <biys> your intolerance and vial rhetoric is apparent yet you "hate racism"
[19:07:09] <I_Am_M00t> you're making things up
[19:07:17] <biys> the mental gymnastics you must have to do in your m ind to justify the way you treat leeloo
[19:07:26] <biys> then cmoe in here and complain about someone "being racist"
[19:08:09] <I_Am_M00t> :) cross channel drama
[19:08:10] <I_Am_M00t> nice
[19:08:26] <biys> it isn't cross channel drama

[19:28:02] <p0indexter> my inuition was correct

[23:14:42] <biys> and they're unwilling to view anything outside their own perspectives
[23:15:44] <biys> i'm constantly amazed at how people who IRC are continually "upset" by words they see on their screen
[23:15:49] <causative> the solution is elenchus
[23:15:56] <biys> someone cusses or uses a racial slur or whatever

[23:16:43] <causative> question the other person's position to find out more about it and try to find a contradiction or unjustified premise, and on the other side, cooperate in such questioning so that you can share your views in detail, without anger or insults
[23:16:56] <biys> exactly

[23:26:42] <I_Am_M00t> and if that's not their position? what happens?
[23:27:26] <I_Am_M00t>  if there's no real attempt to cooperate, what to you do?
[23:27:40] <causative> denounce them for not arguing in good faith
[23:28:20] <causative> if they are insulting you and acting like an ass, and you're just pointing out how their behavior degrades the quality of discourse, they lose
[23:29:54] <I_Am_M00t> but this is the real problem, they think they won, and you think you won

[23:30:06] <causative> they don't think they won if you do it right
[23:30:14] <I_Am_M00t> perhaps
[23:30:19] <causative> they're aware it makes them look bad
[23:31:51] <causative> they probably won't admit it, but you can see from how their behavior changes that they are upset for being called out
[23:33:29] <I_Am_M00t> yes, what about another point. It's tiring to have discussions with such a person, you are giving them free lessons with nothing but insults in return
[23:34:37] <I_Am_M00t> so, you might not want to  dissect their thinking thoroughly
[23:35:35] <causative> well, explaining to them that they are just insulting you and not presenting valid points, is not a free lesson in anything but etiquette
[23:35:55] <I_Am_M00t> yet it demands time and energy from you
[23:36:05] <causative> of course it is an option to just disengage
[23:37:08] <causative> it might not feel good, because we are status-seeking animals - if they insult you and get away without a rejoinder, it may not sit well.  It's up to you if you want to spend the time or not.
[23:38:11] <I_Am_M00t> i just mean, in practice there's often no reward for engaging honestly
[23:38:36] <I_Am_M00t> so this idea of winning against a rando low hanging fruit can be very unmotivating
[23:38:55] <causative> "engaging honestly" is what happens when both of you cooperate in elenchus
[23:39:05] <causative> if he's refusing to cooperate, you're past that point - though you can still rebuke him honestly
[23:39:24] <I_Am_M00t> or you can poke fun, and get some joy
[23:39:59] <causative> that just sounds like reducing yourself to his level
[23:40:53] <causative> which is only a draw at best
[23:41:01] <I_Am_M00t> not if you're having fun
[23:41:42] <I_Am_M00t> then... you are at least enjoying your time a bit
[23:41:50] <causative> it brings more joy to assert moral superiority for *not* engaging in strawmen and ad hominems, that feels more like winning
[23:42:41] <causative> I don't think you get genuine joy and fun out of just a flame war, it's not on the table - he's already made it an unhappy discussion by resorting to insults
[23:42:44] <I_Am_M00t> that's subjective though?
[23:43:10] <causative> the best you can get is to demonstrate dominance and reject his game, which you can't do if you engage in insults in return
[23:43:23] <I_Am_M00t> i think humor is a product of that very situation
[23:45:04] <causative> besides, if you make a habit of giving insults in response to insults, you lose the option to take the moral high ground even when you want to, in later discussions
[23:45:11] <causative> it's a long-term liability
[23:46:00] *** Joins: ttree (~ttree0@c-73-239-62-159.hsd1.wa.comcast.net)

[23:47:39] <I_Am_M00t> hehe, i think reality doesn't work like this.
[23:47:39] <I_Am_M00t> this is something that is true in the context of honest discussions
[23:47:39] <I_Am_M00t> if the honesty is not there, a different ruleset is used
[23:49:17] <causative> in some venues it is difficult, yes, but generally speaking, such on IRC or forums, criticizing their bad faith argument style is the "killer move"
[23:49:35] <causative> there's nothing they can do against it
[23:50:22] <causative> as long as you don't engage in insults too
[23:50:48] <causative> they look bad, and you don't
[23:51:20] *** Joins: choozy (~choozy@75-63-174-82.ftth.glasoperator.nl)
[23:51:58] <causative> and also you may be able to influence discourse in the venue so that people would rather *not* engage in insults, for fear of the "ad hominems are bad faith" type of rejoinder
[23:52:17] <causative> and then you do get to participate in more proper Socratic dialogues, without the insults
[23:52:52] <causative> so not only does it help you "win," it improves the community for everyone
[23:52:56] <I_Am_M00t> I agree on the basis of those assumptions (that it's the right forum, that there is a third party judge)

[23:55:06] <causative> you don't really need a third party judge, mostly the requirement is that it is a long-form discussion where you can actually just explain at length exactly what is wrong with getting mad and abandoning neutrality in a discussion
[23:55:41] <causative> it probably wouldn't work too well in a political debate or a casual conversation, but it does work in an asynchronous text medium such as this
