[01:57:49] <curium> I tried to use colorize egg on one of the chicken-core files and according to the profiler 95% of time is spent on append at line 290, consing the tokens and reversing at the end works better

[02:01:23] <curium> also it would be nice if htmlize was exported ..
[02:05:57] <siiky> if an egg doesn't strictly need openssl (e.g. it works both with HTTP and HTTPS, like http-client), can it not specify openssl as a dependency in its egg file? it seems that's what http-client does, just want to make sure I'm understanding this right, because I may have unnecessarily added openssl as a dep to the transmission egg
[02:07:25] <curium> hm, according to http-client egg file openssl is not a dependency
[02:08:38] <siiky> yeah, I know
[02:09:04] <curium> ah sorry
[02:09:38] <siiky> http-client tries to import openssl at runtime, if the detected/asked scheme is HTTPS
[02:11:11] <siiky> I just want to sanity check that as a reverse dependency of http-client I don't need to add openssl to the deps
[02:11:20] <siiky> npnp maybe I wasn't clear :)
[02:12:02] <klovett> curium>: colorize maintainer is Peter Bex, sjamaan here. 
[02:17:05] <curium> klovett: thanks, I didn't know their nick; is contacting the mantainer the correct thing to do for eggs? (I was reading that there is a bug tracker but not sure if it's used for eggs too)
[02:17:44] <klovett> it is used for eggs so best
[02:19:57] <curium> thanks again
