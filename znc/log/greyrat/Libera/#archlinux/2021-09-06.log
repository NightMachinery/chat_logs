[01:17:01] <MrElendig> at worst it will mess with the boot order, but that is fixable
[01:17:19] <Scimmia> there are some firmwares that remove non-Windows boot entries on a successful Windows boot, though
[01:17:45] <edgy> MrElendig, Namarrgon: let me explain more, Windows was installed using this strange optane technology which is not supported in Linux so I took that optane disk and used it as my home directory in Linux, If Windows boot it does something bad to that partition and I lose my linux booting somehow
[01:17:52] <MrElendig> putting the bootloader in the default load path/windows load path usually works around that
[01:18:24] <MrElendig> can also let windows make an entry for grub/whatever :p

[01:21:04] <grawity> good question, let's see the manual page
[01:21:06] <MrElendig> edgy: useless
[01:21:11] <Namarrgon> its main use nowadays is to set the dirty-bit and force a chkdsk run on the next windows boot
[01:21:14] <grawity> "ntfsfix  is a utility that fixes some common NTFS problems.  ntfsfix is NOT a Linux version of chkdsk.  It only repairs some fundamental NTFS inconsistencies, resets the NTFS journal file and schedules an NTFS consistency check for the first boot into Windows."
[01:22:28] <jessicant> so
[01:22:31] <edgy> if you ALL agree there is no way to fix this from linux then I have to borrow and external drive to temporarily move my files there

[02:30:33] <jacki> so i want to finally fix the typical messagge: Possibly missing firmware for module: aic94xx wd719x xhci_pci
[02:30:53] <jacki> i was reading here
[02:31:25] <jacki> but there is a problem, you use the same word for 2 different things
[02:31:37] <jacki> firmware
[02:32:12] <jacki> like driver and like device internal software
[02:32:53] <jacki> so the wiki says to install these 3 aur package
[02:32:54] <Hydragyrum> firmware is the device-internal, drivers are referred to differently
[02:33:10] <jacki> false
[02:33:59] <sim590> MrElendig, Hydragyrum: nice. Thanks.
[02:34:14] <Hydragyrum> the reason for the message is that your kernel has modules built for those devices, but not the firmware (usually because you don't have the device), so when building the initramfs, it doesn't find that firmware to add to initramfs

[03:09:50] <Namarrgon> if you don't get them for the regular image then that means that these modules are currently not loaded, i.e. you don't have that kind of hardware

[12:06:03] <gloomy> Thanks :) 
[12:08:46] <bookworm> in Arch and pretty much everywhere else but Debian who are still dragging their feet because some dev doesn't like it who controls a core package
[12:10:52] <gloomy> bookworm: good, then there's a chance my issue https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python/issues/17286 won't be dismissed by "we don't support arch, you dork" :) 
[12:11:36] <sheep> does vscode respect $PATH? if so then you could just reconfigure $PATH to not include duplicate directories
[12:12:59] <bookworm> except you *do* want to show symlinks. if you say /usr/bin/python you want the latest, saying /usr/bin/python3.8 is something completely different as that will stay constant
[12:13:08] <gloomy> sheep: might be, let me try :) 
[12:13:18] <bookworm> you can't just remove the "use latest" version willy nilly
[12:13:38] <gloomy> bookworm: symlinks of the directories that contain them

[13:43:08] <NetSysFire> did you read the wiki page for your laptop? also fingerprint reader driver reverse engineering is hard and takes much work
[13:43:27] <NetSysFire> there may already be an in-progress driver which may be mentioned on said laptop page

[18:18:29] <GabCM> I believe you can list video files in a text file and load that into ffmpeg
[18:18:38] <Danilo82> .just play the video with ffplay, go to the part you want to cut, press S to move frame by frame and when you find what you want just tell "-ss "number here" -to "other number here", if you don't need to specify the starting frame you can just use -to
[18:19:04] <GabCM> yeah that's pretty much the way to cut in ffmpeg
[18:20:01] <Danilo82> then what is the problem? just -i what you need, use hardware acceleration if you can to speed things up
[18:20:16] <Gagis> Feels like this is something that a GUI software reeeeeaaallly is the better option for. I'll just use kdenlive or blender the next time. Just got to try to salvage the work thats already been done by now

[20:55:48] <f1refly> i set the user to x and the group to x, the user under which i set the whole thing up. thit doesn't work because podman tries to write the pid files to /run which is not possible with user x privileges

[23:52:35] <grawity> so you're looking for it to have a built-in html upload form page?
[23:53:00] <grawity> (I'm now curious whether Apache could natively accept PUT... like through its WebDAV support)

[23:53:39] <ijr> I'm not sure. I'm a total beginner
[23:53:52] <electrohead> ijr: are you looking for anyone to upload files, or only you?
[23:54:24] <ijr> just me, but from multiple remote computers.
[23:54:31] <tusko> yeah. maybe its rofi
[23:54:33] <grawity> it usually is not something that comes built in to a web server, though I've seen some on Windows (oriented specifically towards file sharing instead of websites)
[23:55:04] <grawity> there are however a few PHP-based file managers which you could host
[23:55:17] <electrohead> could always just do it via ssh/scp
[23:55:27] <grawity> (pretty sure some of them are just 1 file, nothing huge like nextcloud)
[23:55:57] <ijr> I looked into ssh, but I need something totally web-based. I am looking into php file managers now.

[23:57:14] <electrohead> and it works very nicely. but if you are looking for a pure web based way of doing that, yeah either make your own, or browse around online, see what exists out there

[23:58:23] <grawity> hmm yes the WebDAV support in Apache could probably be used to make an extremely simple file upload form using PUT

[23:59:16] <electrohead> vipulogmx_: I made an easier version, and just as good :p

[23:59:38] <grawity> one advantage of the php file managers is that at least some of them might have a decent progress bar for uploads
