[18:16:26] <phy1729> !&&||
[18:16:26] <greybot> foo && bar || baz is not equivalent to 'if foo; then bar; else baz; fi'. In the former case, baz will happen if *either* foo *or* bar return false. In the latter case, baz will only trigger if foo returns false, regardless of the exit code for bar. See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls
[18:16:32] <Bhavuk> in the 1st case, the condition is defined by the value of x, and then either y or z is executed

[19:02:44] <Bhavuk> ham5, I think we misunderstood your requirement earlier.. do you want to read x lines from multiple files?
[19:02:56] <ham5> yes
[19:03:18] <Bhavuk> very simple.. use for loop to pickup the files and tail them

[19:06:58] <ham5> if I have 5 files, and I want the last 10 lines, the last file only has 2 lines, so I need some lines from the next newest file, but no reason to through all 5 files right?

The REAL time will only show the date/time from start to finish, which is deceptive

[22:57:02] <ormaaj> It's consistent with all the other tests. Makes sense.
[22:58:34] <eggbean> so -f is not just a regular file and also could be a symlink?
[22:59:10] <eggbean> And there way of testing for a symlink that points to a file?
[22:59:28] <eggbean> there's no way, I mean
[22:59:55] <ormaaj> [[ -L $file && -f $file ]]
[23:00:21] <eggbean> ok cheers
