[03:00:54] <ditto_irl> "a point in history" so it should represent a specific commit on a specific branch, shouldn't it?
[03:01:16] <ditto_irl> or the state of all active branches at that point in time?

[04:46:32] <[itchyjunk]> why is the public void paint() outside the maint () { }
[04:46:54] <[itchyjunk]> if it's just another method, why isn't it declared on top. i also don't see where it gets called
[04:47:27] <molson_> it doesn't matter where you declare them in java, as long as they were in scope.
[04:47:47] <[itchyjunk]> ah, so its some method in the class Drawing
[04:47:53] <phogg> Is it usual in java to declare methods inside other methods? Seems weird to me.
[04:47:55] <[itchyjunk]> but i never use it inside main
[04:48:08] <[itchyjunk]> inside method?
[04:48:18] <[itchyjunk]> main and paint are the 2 methods
[04:48:25] <[itchyjunk]> and they are not declared inside each other
[04:48:25] <molson_> it extends Canvas, so Paint is called via Canvas\
[04:48:38] *** Joins: riff-IRC (~riff-IRC@user/riff-irc)
[04:48:40] <phogg> [itchyjunk]: I would guess that the Canvas method provides paint() which Drawing is overriding. Even if it's not called directly it might be called indirectly by the base class.
[04:48:45] <[itchyjunk]> ahh when i call canvas, got it

[06:33:08] <webNET4> the function is junk
[06:33:10] <[itchyjunk]> they probably want thim to use it
[06:33:34] <[itchyjunk]> probably a backend unit test that passes random numbers for months to check if it works
[06:33:36] <quartz> SO I don't need to use the DaysInMonth?
[06:33:40] <[itchyjunk]> that's what my professor would do
[06:33:52] <quartz> lol
[06:34:02] <quartz> [itchyjunk]: Thanks for the tip, but this is a coding exercise :)
[06:34:59] <phogg> quartz: the correct answer is not to reinvent the wheel and to use system provided date objects. If the point is an exercise in programming a more realistic real world problem should have been chosen.
[06:35:01] <webNET4> you can at least use it to populate your table

[06:36:20] <jinsun> quartz: if you get 6 ints then that month calculation can be done in one line, but that question in your image is about number of days instead of number of months, which would need different logic and few more lines

[06:39:45] <phogg> does it expect you to handle leap years?
[06:40:19] <phogg> if you are providing a generic routine for system use it would have to handle leap years
[06:40:21] <[itchyjunk]> only good way to handle leap year is to add a year every 1200 years
[06:40:43] <[itchyjunk]> i doubt his exercise cares about leap years. else it would mention it
[06:41:09] <quartz> phogg: No leap yaers
[06:41:21] <webNET4> they don't say no leap years
[06:41:25] <webNET4> its not specified
[06:41:28] <webNET4> its like 2 sentences
[06:41:34] <phogg> if it's not specified you must assume support is required
[06:41:41] <phogg> it's certainly implied
[06:42:00] <jinsun> they provide a DaysInMonth function that takes month and year both
[06:42:18] <jinsun> so leap year is expected be handled using that
[06:42:40] <phogg> that rather simplifies things

[07:10:18] <arahael> phogg: Everything.
[07:10:43] <phogg> I thought the whole point of Java was that memory was managed for you.
[07:10:45] <molson_> If you have to allocate a new immutable object in java, you have to set it to the variable, and the garbage collector will remove the old value. Java does this with strings, and the manipulation of them
[07:11:19] <webNET4> can you pass a "temporary" color that was passed as like Color(255, 255, 0)   ?
[07:11:32] <quartz> GOd I love using Linux. So glad I switched after seeing what Windows 11 is becoming.
[07:11:51] <arahael> phogg: You still use "new".
[07:12:38] <phogg> arahael: that's just syntax. *You* don't allocate anything, the runtime may allocate something for you if it thinks you need it.
[07:13:03] <Samian> zero division sucks! To the guy who invented zero, thanks for nothing.
[07:14:48] <arahael> phogg: That's also sematics.  You've told the runtime to allocate memory. Is it signifiant that you're not actually going down and figuring out exactly where it should be? Because in that case, you could say C developers don't allocate memory either.
[07:15:30] <phogg> You could say that nobody really does anything, if you want to look at it that way
[07:15:35] <arahael> phogg: That said, Java does manage memory for you, but that's a somewhat different topic to the fairly precise question you asked.
[07:15:37] <phogg> it's not a useful distinction

[07:17:24] <webNET4> i don't see any for loops
[07:17:57] <phogg> arahael: Since there is no *separate* "allocate" step in Java I would say it's not useful to talk about it. There's nothing you do to allocate, it happens as a side effect of construction.
[07:18:09] <[itchyjunk]> Color p = new Color(int,int,int,int);

[12:58:31] <soulisson> Sorry about this stupid question. According to this wikipedia article "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure", a data structure is a "a data structure is a collection of data values, ..." but in the same page, they provide as examples of data structures "struct" in C and Objects, I'm a little bit confused because I always consider those as means to hold data, rather than data values, if someone could provide me some explanation, it 
[12:58:32] <bayaz> Title: Data structure - Wikipedia 
[12:58:32] <soulisson> would be really helpful?
[12:59:35] <Akronymus> soulisson a data structure can be anything from a struct, to an array, to unions, to a combination, to lists, to graphs and so on.
[12:59:40] <Akronymus> It is a VERY wide topic.
[12:59:54] <Akronymus> Basically anyhting that gives data a structure is a data structure.
[13:00:09] *** Joins: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn)
[13:00:28] <Akronymus> Struct gives it a structure through making the relative positions fixed.

[13:03:40] <soulisson> Akronymus, ok, but this is not the issue I'm having. A structure is defined as a collection of values while in the same page, some of the examples provided are containers, rather than values in themselves, so I'm a little bit confused.
[13:05:10] <Akronymus> What would you say is a container?
[13:05:28] <jinsun> soulisson: what do you mean by "data values" and why is it different from data?
[13:05:32] *** Joins: jtgd (~jtgd@068-186-050-156.res.spectrum.com)
[13:05:43] <Akronymus> And a container is a data structure too.
[13:05:49] <Akronymus> Because it gives you metadata.
[13:06:05] <Akronymus> For example Option<T> can be Some T or None
[13:06:18] <Akronymus> Which makes it a container.
[13:06:29] <Akronymus> But also, it gives the data a structure.
[13:06:35] <Akronymus> Which makes it a data structure.

[16:17:41] <pyzozord> Amadiro: I have the main thread where I have a loop, this loops renders always does SDL_RenderCopy(anim.frames[anim.curr]). Then I have a "side thread" that starts when the program starts, to decode the animation from gif. it decodes all frame, after each frame it updates anim.frames
[16:17:46] *** Quits: bitmega (~bitmega@user/bitmega) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[16:18:22] <GeDaMo> Do you have a mutex or something on anim.frames?
[16:18:25] <pyzozord> The idea is that the program is responsive immediatly and it animates each new frame as soon as it's decoded
[16:18:28] <Amadiro> pyzozord, so your goal is to be able to start rendering frames before all the frames are decoded?
[16:18:33] <pyzozord> no no mutexes or anything else
[16:18:41] <pyzozord> Amadiro: yes, exactly
[16:19:10] <GeDaMo> If you have two threads accessing the same data item you'll need some way of synchronizing
[16:19:11] <Amadiro> pyzozord, I don't think you're buying anything by using frames here, because you're gonna be waiting something like 16-33ms between displaying each frame anyway, and in that timeframe you can decode hundreds of thousands of frames
[16:19:12] <pyzozord> I'm wondering should I add some mutexes, but it doesn't seem necessary since the main thread only reads
[16:19:24] <Amadiro> by using threads, I mean
[16:19:28] <DnzAtWrk> sounds like you should be using shaders rather than threads
[16:19:30] <GeDaMo> It could be reading incorrect data

[16:19:44] <Amadiro> pyzozord, it is necessary, but you could instead make the integer atomic
[16:19:53] <pyzozord> Amadiro: no this decoding is stupid slow, it takes sometimes 30ms to decode a frame
[16:19:55] <Amadiro> then you won't need a mutex
[16:20:12] <DnzAtWrk> ah
[16:20:25] <Amadiro> pyzozord, do these have a crazy resolution or something?
[16:20:52] <pyzozord> Amadiro: no just very naive code
[16:21:14] *** Quits: gggp (~textual@111.63.44.6) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[16:21:32] <Amadiro> either way you're not buying anything by using threads as long as you're just using one extra thread, because what you have now is a worker thread (busy) and a main thread that's always idle except for that one nanosecond every 16 or 33ms where it flips the image on the screen
[16:21:32] <pyzozord> Amadiro: you can see in line 23 https://ideone.com/wmZvdm function decodepixles() 
[16:21:37] <bayaz> Title: Ideone.com 
[16:21:49] <Amadiro> but what you might want to do here in the future is to decode multiple frames on multiple threads in parallel
[16:22:00] <DnzAtWrk> myes, the optimal number of threads can be more something like 8-20 something
[16:22:05] <DnzAtWrk> depending on the number of cores you have
[16:22:28] <pyzozord> Amadiro: I can see a drastic improvement in responsiveness during intial decoding when using the thread
[16:22:58] <pyzozord> Amadiro: I think you are assuming my code is much more efficient than it is
[16:23:13] <Amadiro> pyzozord, then that's probably more related to how you programmed it (you block until a frame is fully decoded)
[16:23:30] <Amadiro> but either way, your approach is fine if you're planning to extend it so that you can decode on multiple threads in parallel in the future (which makes the most sense)
[16:23:46] *** Joins: Bou (uid274843@user/bou)
[16:23:55] <DnzAtWrk> well, if you like your program slowing down the computer
[16:23:58] <pyzozord> Yes, originally this was a single threaded program. It had the main loop: wait for ttyfd changes, collect sdl events, decode animation frame, render animation frame, render text layer, loop
[16:24:46] <DnzAtWrk> one frame for decoding is enough
[16:24:50] <DnzAtWrk> the important thing is that it's not blocking
[16:24:55] <pyzozord> I think because the decoding animation frame is so inefficient, the single threaded program was quite choppy/unresponsive during the initial decoding
[16:25:00] <DnzAtWrk> however your program handles not having the data available *shrug*
[16:25:16] <DnzAtWrk> one thread*
[16:25:48] <DnzAtWrk> I mean, it entirely depends on what happens while it's still decoding
[16:25:56] <DnzAtWrk> does the program just run normally, or do you pause it and wait
[16:26:01] <Amadiro> pyzozord, the trick to making it responsive on a single thread is to make the decoder to a small chunk of of work (e.g. that takes a tenth of a millisecond) and then do that in a loop until such a time comes that you need to update the screen, then you do that, and then go back to decoding small chunks at a time
[16:26:18] <Amadiro> pyzozord, the reason yours was unresponsive/choppy is because the unit of work you did at a time was not granular enough (decoding a whole frame)
[16:26:36] <pyzozord> Yeah i know but I was chunking per frame, and decoding a single frame just takes too long
[16:26:41] <DnzAtWrk> I bet you could find a decoder that you run in several batches
[16:26:49] <pyzozord> essentially the threading gives me automatic chunking in some sense
[16:27:08] <pyzozord> DnzAtWrk: yeah that's a plan for later, this decoder is just terrible
[16:27:21] <DnzAtWrk> well yeah, just like networking, run the decoder in its own thread
[16:27:24] <DnzAtWrk> that's optimal
[16:27:36] <Amadiro> pyzozord, but either way, if you're interested in expanding this, I'd try to get a threadpool going and coordinate it so that each thread that's not busy picks a frame to decode and then does that. You'll get a couple interesting challenges related to threading this way, like setting up a work-queue (each thread should immediately start on a new frame when it's done with the previous one)
[16:27:43] <pyzozord> DnzAtWrk: That's exactly what I am doing right now, 
[16:27:55] <Amadiro> as well as the problem of coordinating so that the rendering thread always knows what the "lowest" frame number is that's ready to be displayed
[16:28:04] <DnzAtWrk> I don't think he needs a pool. This is a question about finishing fast vs non-blocking
[16:28:08] <Amadiro> because once you have multiple threads going, you might have frame 1, 2, 3, 30, 31 and 33 ready
[16:28:09] <DnzAtWrk> and it sounds like he just wants non-blocking
[16:28:13] <Amadiro> but you'd only want the main thread to play 1, 2, 3
[16:28:44] <pyzozord> Amadiro: that sounds too complicated
[16:28:45] <Amadiro> well, assuming this is an academic exercise about threads, at any rate
[16:28:49] <pyzozord> yeah I just wanted non-blocking
[16:29:10] <Amadiro> if you care about just making this fast and usable and you want actual results, I wouldn't go to threads because it should be possible to do this quickly without
[16:29:20] <pyzozord> not exactly academic, but just a small introduction for me. Never wrote multithreaded code before
[16:29:32] <DnzAtWrk> entirely depends on the smallest unit your decoder can run it
[16:29:48] <DnzAtWrk> when I use a* pathfinding, I also use another thread
[16:29:56] <beaky> why not try writing multithreaded code in rust so that the borrow checker can prevent data races in your threads
[16:29:57] <DnzAtWrk> but sometimes I put in a max_iterations parameter
[16:30:00] <DnzAtWrk> and run it on the main thread

[16:30:13] <pyzozord> I believe it could just do one pixel at a time, but I don't wanna invest more time in this decoded since I want to replace it anyway. And having the decoding process in separate thread seems like a good idea anyway

[16:31:58] <Amadiro> pyzozord, if it's not academic, you can also just include a gif decoder library or whatever
[16:32:08] <pyzozord> Anyway, thanks for helping me think through this :)

[16:59:10] <Amadiro> pyzozord, you might be able to read it through the extension block. But either way, the field might be optional, so I guess you might have to be prepared to not know ahead of time

[16:59:44] <Amadiro> pyzozord, one thing you could try is to call gd_get_frame() in a loop until it doesn't return another frame anymore
[16:59:48] <Amadiro> that might be quite fast
[16:59:57] <Amadiro> and then you do the actual rendering and blitting afterwards, if possible
[17:00:08] <pyzozord> yeah I think so too
[17:00:21] <pyzozord> I think the gd_get_frame is what is actually so slow in all of this, but I'll check that
[17:00:24] <Amadiro> also, you want to avoid looping over the pixels yourself and instead gd_render_frame directly into the SDL surface
[17:00:24] *** Joins: wwilly (~wwilly@fw-tnat-cam7.arm.com)
[17:00:43] <Amadiro> yeah you might wanna have a quick look at that with a profiler or by inserting some timing commands
[17:01:17] <Amadiro> generally you want to avoid freeing, allocating and memory copying as much as you can
[17:01:28] <pyzozord> I think I will do something different instead
[17:01:47] <Amadiro> the trick to that tends to be that the receiving end of the data has to agree on the format with where it comes from
[17:02:11] <pyzozord> I will not reallocate. I will allocate new bigger space. Create the frame there. And once I'm ready I'll just swap the frames pointer and then free old memory
[17:02:27] <Amadiro> why do you need to free old memory?
[17:03:06] <pyzozord> I mean anim.frames. It's an array of pointers to sdl textures
[17:03:12] <pyzozord> sdl textures live where they want to live anway
[17:03:26] <pyzozord> but the array of pointers gets reallocated on each frame
[17:04:21] <Amadiro> oh, that's just a small allocation -- you can instead allocate it to be large and remember the fill level, but either way, it doesn't matter
[17:04:47] <Amadiro> but you also shouldn't need to re-allocate tmppixels for every frame for instance

[17:05:18] <pyzozord> no no, not reallocating pixels
[17:05:45] <pyzozord> hmm I guess you are right, I'll just make the initiall array of pointers very big to see if that crashes
[17:05:56] <pyzozord> and if it doesn't then I can make it nicer some way
[17:06:19] <Amadiro> well, some kind of list that can grow would be ideal there, like a linked list or a C++ vector
[17:06:32] <Amadiro> but either way, that's a very small datastructure so it shouldn't matter all that much for perf

[17:08:39] <pyzozord> Ideally I wanted to store all frames in one big texture atlas so it's continous memory, but because I can't find out the number of frames up fron fast I decided to keep each frame as a separate texture

[17:11:32] <Amadiro> pyzozord, I think you can avoid gd_render_frame() alltogether, because when you do gd_get_frame it stores the pixels in gif->frame
[17:11:32] <pyzozord> yeah I know but i'm just bothered that I have "gaps" in memory like this, I wanted it all to stay together
[17:11:45] <Amadiro> pyzozord, and then you use SDL_CreateRGBSurfaceFrom(gif->frame)
[17:11:56] <Amadiro> so you don't need to allocate or copy anything

[17:12:08] <pyzozord> good tip, thanks. I'll look at that

[17:16:24] <Amadiro> it looks like it only updates the region of gif->frame that has changed, so you will still need to do gd_render_frame after all I think
[17:16:39] <Amadiro> also it's indexed, so you'd need to use an indexed surface in SDL too, not an RGB one

[18:12:12] <wedr> to be fair, C++ static methods are pretty much the same, compared to Java.
[18:12:26] <wedr> ok, there might be differences, but the scope is very similar
[18:12:35] <[itchyjunk]> since i write it inside my class
[18:12:41] <[itchyjunk]> it would be fine i thought
[18:12:44] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: you need to create a Recur instance to call factorial
[18:13:14] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: no,  normal methods get called on instances.  They have a "this" (even if implicit).  You cannot call a normal method without an instance to call it on.
[18:14:59] <[itchyjunk]> oh
[18:15:12] <[itchyjunk]> if my method was static, i could have called it without instance?
[18:15:25] <[itchyjunk]> and my method is not static i guess
[18:15:29] <[itchyjunk]> since it's doing stuff
[18:15:35] <[itchyjunk]> "changing the state of n"
[18:15:37] <[itchyjunk]> or somesuch
[18:15:39] <[itchyjunk]> right makes sense
[18:17:07] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: all (non-static) methods have an implicit "this" in them, a reference to the instance they're called on. You call methods like `some_instance.some_method()`.
[18:17:38] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: inside a method, you can call other methods on your own instance with `this.some_method()` (and Java, to be "helpful" let's you drop the "this" in many/most places)

[18:22:04] <Bou> in this case your "factorial" method doesn't access/change the state of anything so you can make it static
[18:22:12] <[itchyjunk]> java has no place to do `this.` because i have no instance created
[18:22:23] <[itchyjunk]> oh!
[18:22:49] <[itchyjunk]> it's creating a new memory location where n-1 gets stored so the location of where my original n poitns to remains unchanged

[18:23:56] <[itchyjunk]> and it says i must do so
[18:24:04] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: the problem is that "factorial" is a method on Recurs instances.
[18:24:17] <beaky> factorial sounds like factorio

[18:25:05] <[itchyjunk]> right, but now the error is about return
[18:25:13] <[itchyjunk]> factorial needs to return int

This can be done by storing a hierachy of transformation matrices, and the final transformation matrix is computed by multiplying all the matrices as you traverse the hierachy
[19:58:18] <Amadiro> for instance you might have a scene, containing a person, containing a leg, containing a foot. To know the transformation of the foot, you need to multiply M_scene * M_person * M_leg * M_foot
[19:58:29] <Amadiro> M_foot is the matrix describing the foots position relative to the leg etc
[19:58:39] <smallvi__> can this be done with just x,y values?
[19:58:44] <Amadiro> Sure it can be
[19:59:03] <Amadiro> a transformation matrix in 2D would be a 3x3 matrix, but you don't have to use matrices explicitly
[19:59:15] <smallvi__> like, with just an x value and a y value, and no matrix
[19:59:22] <Amadiro> but either way, while this can be confusing it's really quite straightforward, I'd recommend drawing out some examples on paper
