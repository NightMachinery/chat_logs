[00:47:10] <Nasp> Is this some sort of deep copy method?

[00:49:35] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Can you remember how you add a controller from another project :D
[00:49:52] <Nasp> As in register it even though it exists in another project
[00:49:58] <Nasp> I did it not so long ago and i forgot :D
[00:50:03] <Suchiman> Nasp: nope
[00:50:14] <MaNa2k> Nasp, no its not a deep copy even thuogh i must admitt it looks like it. Its basically to remap a objA to objB. ObjB has some few more properties than objA, otherwise its very simliar. objB is like an expansion of objA
[00:52:14] <Nasp> And AutoMapper or Mapster didn't fit your needs?
[00:53:13] <MaNa2k> Nasp, didnt really want to use external lib for this
[00:53:39] <Nasp> Why not
[00:53:46] <Nasp> you are already including newtonsoft
[00:54:33] <MaNa2k> Nasp, yes, but newtonsofts been with us since day 1
[00:54:52] <MaNa2k> but we are kidn of considering replacing it
[00:55:01] <MaNa2k> i hear microsofts json parser is faster
[00:55:22] <Nasp> I'm just saying if i saw someone add that method to our codebase, i would go over and hit him :D
[00:55:55] <MaNa2k> Nasp, newtonsoft ?
[00:56:03] <Nasp> That transform method
[00:56:07] <MaNa2k> ah, lol
[00:56:27] <MaNa2k> well it seems to be working though

[01:17:41] <biberu> that's a fear emoji
[01:17:47] <MaNa2k> ah i see it now
[01:18:05] <biberu> it may also be your ghost after that thing bites you
[01:19:37] <biberu> even if you don't want to pull in another library, why not just make a mapping function?
[01:20:32] <MaNa2k> biberu, its just feels unnessesary to waste time on remapping stuff to a different class thats practically 99% the same
[01:21:11] <biberu> it is not, but you should have a reason to perform the mapping ofc
[01:22:24] <MaNa2k> there is a real reason why im remapping. but dont want to get into it
[01:22:50] <biberu> now you're losing both safety and performance, that thing could blow up on you at runtime since you basically told the compiler to gtfo
[01:23:24] <MaNa2k> biberu, how so ?
[01:23:50] <MaNa2k> please elaborate
[01:24:00] <biberu> how are you working with it there? will it be able to tell you of issues if either side changes?

[13:56:41] <bomb> no, I mean, his talent :P
[13:56:49] <jmer> They had one used, laying around from my father's girlfriend's dead husband
[13:56:54] <bomb> and dan, that's a great present
[13:56:59] <jmer> Well
[13:57:09] <bomb> lol he didn't even pay for it
[13:57:22] <jmer> we bought an electronic piano for her as well... But the one we got is a lot better quality because we got it during black friday sales
[13:57:35] <jmer> so now we're discussing wether to return the one we bought or just give it to her anyways so she can have two
[13:57:38] <bomb> what brand/model you got?
[13:57:54] <jmer> I don't know... It was my wife that ordered it
[13:58:05] <bomb> how many euros?
[13:58:09] <bomb> or DKK, if you wish
[13:58:26] <jmer> well we gave 1000DKK and it's normal price is 3000DKK
[13:58:40] <bomb> you now that's a lie
[13:59:02] <jmer> I think that depends where you buy it
[13:59:04] <bomb> but 1000 EUR digital piano should be a nice one
[13:59:10] <jmer> it's DKK
[13:59:15] <bomb> DKK = EUR
[13:59:21] <bomb> they're equal
[13:59:24] <jmer> lol
[13:59:25] <jmer> they are not
[13:59:34] <bomb> did Nasp lie to me?
[13:59:35] <jmer> 1€ == 7.5 DKK
[13:59:40] <bomb> oh fucker
[13:59:48] <jmer> But they are bound together
[14:00:03] <jmer> in the sense that the DKK will only fluctuate with 0.3 or something like that
[14:00:09] <jmer> -/+ 0.3
[14:00:18] <bomb> 135 EUR must be a piece of plastic that making noise
[14:00:29] <bomb> but your daughter is 5, it wouldn't matter
[14:00:41] <jmer> as I said, the normal price is 3000DKK and it's "full size" (compared to a piano)
[14:00:46] <jmer> no she is 10
[14:00:53] <bomb> 88-key I got it
[14:01:04] <jmer> the one she got from my dad isn't full size

[14:08:07] <MatthiasVance> jmer: Well, just my job.
[14:08:52] <MatthiasVance> jmer: To be more precise, I implemented an error page for <some situation>
[14:11:16] <SKull> MatthiasVance: to hide a 500 error? ^^$
[14:11:36] <MatthiasVance> Actually a permission denied one, but the authorization handler for that situation checked if <process> was completed
[14:11:55] <MatthiasVance> This is step 2 of 3, next step is fixing it so everything works fine and making the error page obsolete again :D
[14:12:42] <SKull> MatthiasVance: so you don't just print the stacktrace in the browser? ;)

[14:13:44] <MatthiasVance> SKull: LOL, no monitoring?
[14:14:24] <SKull> MatthiasVance: everywhere i worked, monitoring consisted mainly of a ping. a web request if they were serious about it.
[14:14:33] <MatthiasVance> ah
[14:14:55] <MatthiasVance> Yeah I also usually was the person to suggest .. you have 20 instances, maybe time to add some monitoring?
[14:15:45] <MatthiasVance> Same place where they used a VS extension to insert regions with comments containing your initials, date and all you had to do was enter what you changed .. and then use that for every line in every file that you changed.. and then leave the commit message (what's that?) empty
[14:16:21] <SKull> ugh, at least add an automatic commit message then
[14:16:36] <MatthiasVance> The "what you changed" could be different per line/file
[14:17:38] <MatthiasVance> It was actually a fun project to improve since with one smallish implementation you could have massive impact on developer productivity
[14:17:50] <MatthiasVance> Also, *everything* was static :o

[14:23:14] <MatthiasVance> "Do we migrate to an interface that we could mock out? Where we have two implementations of IDice, the real implementation, and a test-only implementation that we could use to pre-ordain the numbers being returned. That felt heavy-handed for this usage. Instead, we can reach for delegates."
[14:23:36] <MatthiasVance> So we just add a static method to the implementation that you can give a stub to

[16:17:53] <SKull> although stealing is the wrong word. Lovecraft's stuff is free for all to take, and that is intentional.
[16:17:59] <jmer> did you read anything regarding Chtulu?
[16:18:12] <SKull> i've read everything Lovecraft ever published.
[16:18:14] <jmer> I mean... I see lots of references, but what book should I read?
[16:18:17] <jmer> is it good?
[16:18:24] <jmer> or just "horror"
[16:18:45] <SKull> i'm a total Lovecraft fanboy, so i'm maybe not the best judge
[16:18:59] <SKull> not the most objective judge
[16:19:01] <jmer> Well... Horror bores me (I don't get scared by fiction)
[16:19:14] <jmer> But if there's interesting characters, world building etc...
[16:19:35] <SKull> jmer: there is. and his horror still is scary and mad.
[16:20:16] <SKull> jmer: i recommend starting with 'The Whisperer in Darkness', or, if you don't mind reading a book with a bit more pages: "Mountains of Madness"
[16:21:07] <SKull> And you have to keep in mind that the southpole was not really explored at the time he wrote 'The Mountains of Madness'

[16:23:23] <interop_madness> I'm gonna give the Babylon 5 reboot a chance, but just because it's JMS and just because he said he has free reign

[16:31:57] <interop_madness> i can count on one hand the characters I found legitimately scary
[16:32:25] <interop_madness> PSH in the count to ten scene in one of the mission impossible parts was scary, but he just was a stellar actor

[16:39:04] <JakeSays> ohh i wasn't aware there was a remake
[16:39:14] <SKull> JakeSays: it has a different ending than the book, but i think it fits.
[16:39:30] <SKull> JakeSays: and we all know that Stephen King and endings don't go together well anyhow
[16:39:39] <SKull> but it did fit
[16:40:23] <SKull> I even think the story is more true to the book than in the older tv adaptions. But I haven't seen those in a while so i'm not entirely sure.
[16:40:30] <JakeSays> the stand is one of my fav king books
[16:40:52] <SKull> yeah, i've read it twice in german and once in english, it was that good to me
