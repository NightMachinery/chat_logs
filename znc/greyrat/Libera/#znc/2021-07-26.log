[01:40:23] <Fhazal> hye 
[01:40:47] <Fhazal> may i know how can i make znc webadmin using valid ssl cert
[01:41:51] <adhawkins> Look at SSLCertFile, SSLDHParamFile and SSLKeyFile in the config file.
[01:43:05] <adhawkins> Fhazal: More info here: https://wiki.znc.in/Signed_SSL_certificate
[01:45:32] <Fhazal> thats for using ssl when u online to the server
[01:45:43] <Fhazal> im looking for webadmin ssl
[01:46:02] <Fhazal> to make it valid ssl not looking and not secure
[01:47:06] <adhawkins> It's the same certificate as far as I'm aware.
[01:47:39] <Fhazal> i already have the let's encrypt cert 
[01:48:09] <Fhazal> just don't know how to make webadmin using valid cert 
[01:48:18] <adhawkins> Then you just need to set the appropriate paths in the config file I think.
[01:48:41] <adhawkins> I have mine behind a traefik instance personally.
[01:49:09] <adhawkins> But I used to do it as per those instructions in the past.
[01:50:23] <DarthGandalf>  <Fhazal> thats for using ssl when u online to the server
[01:50:27] <DarthGandalf> what does this even mean?
[01:50:52] *** Joins: rasp-pc (~rasp-pc@c-73-179-103-211.hsd1.fl.comcast.net)
[01:51:56] <Fhazal> i mean ssl cert to verify with ircd
[01:52:47] <adhawkins> I don't think that's true Fhazal
[01:53:05] <adhawkins> Or are you saying you want to use an SSL certificate to authenticate yourself with the IRC server?
[01:54:06] <Fhazal> no i can use ssl port to connect to irc server 
[01:54:21] <Fhazal> just want to make webadmin using valid ssl 
[01:54:38] <MetaNova> then reference https://wiki.znc.in/Signed_SSL_certificate as adhawkins already pointed out
[01:58:18] <Fhazal> SSLCertFile = /path/to/combined/cert.pem
[01:58:18] <Fhazal> SSLKeyFile = /path/to/private/key.pem
[01:58:18] <Fhazal> SSLDHParamFile = /path/to/DH/file.pem
[01:58:27] <Fhazal> and set at config file??
[01:58:36] <Fhazal> using the path to ssl cert?
[01:59:17] <adhawkins> Correct. As per that web page.
[01:59:56] <Fhazal> ok i try
[02:00:06] <Fhazal> thanks adhawkins

[16:24:49] <Casper> Hmhm... The attacks are just too frequent and I've switched hosts twice now and made pretty much no difference.
[16:28:02] <kushal> eeks
[16:28:27] <kushal> Casper, are these attacks targeting the host or the znc itself?
[16:29:30] <Casper> The host, they just flood the server, both IPv4 and IPv6 as well.
[16:33:21] <kushal> Okay, nothing much can be done at that moment I guess :(
[16:34:14] <Casper> "at the moment" has been several months unfortunately already.
[16:36:37] <Khaytsus> Not to repeat myself, but it's exactly what someone wants. :/  
[16:37:15] <Casper> Khaytsus, yep. But if it's been going on for months, why should I even bother in keeping it up, they'll keep on going as well, and if they stop, someone else happily continues.
[16:37:16] <Khaytsus> Casper: Purely curious, have you incurred any monetary costs or limitations from it?  
[16:37:47] <Khaytsus> ie:  fees, provider limiting your network or blocking things out of your control to limit the DDOS, stuff like that
[16:37:52] <Casper> Khaytsus, LunarBNC not due to the attacks, no. But LunarBNC has never made any money, it's always just been hobby.
[16:38:22] <Khaytsus> Right but but I could see egress 1G max, you used 10G this month (under attack), $$$
[16:39:25] <Casper> Nah, with 20TB bandwidth that's hard to achieve.
[16:39:32] <Khaytsus> Or your provider limiting you to N connections or netowrk speed to mitigate.  Or even drop packets, etc, at their borders
[16:39:54] <Casper> They have DDoS filtering, but that only works for IPv4 (because I use an IPv6 tunnel)
[16:40:03] <Khaytsus> Okay was curious how providers handle that sort these days, maybe they have so much resource they don't care about such things at this scale
[16:40:43] <Casper> Unfortunately finding a provider that 1) has DDoS filtering 2) provides a /48 subnet 3) has filtering on that too 4) is not too expensive are annoyingly hard to find.

[16:43:41] <Khaytsus> way back in the day I used to get randomly attacked and then I'd drop offline for minutes at a time because my ISP would just basically drop all connections to me
[16:43:51] <Khaytsus> And then they'd turn it on, it'd still be ongoing, repeat
[16:44:38] <Casper> Yeah, RamNode does that too on their unfiltered IPs.
[16:45:23] <Khaytsus> First time it happened I was floundering around trying to figure out wtf was going on
[16:45:41] <Khaytsus> Finally called my ISP and they explained their blackhole DDOS mitigation heh
[16:45:56] <Khaytsus> So i"m being DDOSed so you turn my network off entirely.  Um.

[16:46:29] <Khaytsus> I'd see packets for like 10s, then it'd disappear.
[16:46:58] <Casper> One of the reasons I don't host this at home. :P
[16:47:20] <Khaytsus> They were a small ISP, really concentrated more on providing high speed internet to downtown businesses back in the day when a T1 was very expensive and high speed.
[16:47:31] <Khaytsus> But also provided DSL to residential
[16:47:49] <Khaytsus> Which afaik really was just routed through them, everything else was just the phone company of course

[20:34:50] <Osy> Hey all.
[20:35:13] <Osy> Just deployed znc on asuswrt merlin, via entware.
[20:35:45] <Osy> It's up now, i'm connected through it - but the webadmin doesn't seem to work.
[20:36:02] <Osy> It listens on the advertised port, but i'm getting
[20:36:07] <Osy> Not Found
[20:36:07] <Osy> The requested URL was not found on this server.
[20:36:07] <MetaNova> a deployment on a router
[20:36:10] <MetaNova> terrific.
[20:36:29] <MetaNova> Osy: show the output of '/msg *status version' (both lines) as well as '/msg *status listports'
[20:37:02] <MetaNova> assuming you've connected your client to the ZNC instance
[20:37:08] <MetaNova> (if it is actually "up")
[20:39:59] <Osy> It is, like I said, this is through mirc connected to the znc instance
[20:41:31] <Osy> [19:10] <*status> ZNC 1.8.2 - https://znc.in
[20:41:31] <Osy> [19:10] <*status> IPv6: yes, SSL: yes, DNS: threads, charset: yes, i18n: no, build: cmake

[20:42:23] <Osy> [19:11] <*status> +-------+----------+-----+----------+-----+-----------+
[20:42:50] <Osy> obfuscated the port, for obvious reasons
[20:42:59] <MetaNova> so your instance is accepting IRC connections, obviously, and ZNC appears configured to accept HTTP connections as well
[20:43:02] <MetaNova> is webadmin loaded?
[20:43:10] <Osy> any command to check that?
[20:43:14] <MetaNova> /msg *status loadmod webadmin
[20:43:42] <MetaNova> actually you might want /msg *status loadmod --type=global webadmin
[20:43:52] <Osy> [19:13] <*status> Unable to load webadmin: Unable to find module webadmin.
[20:44:19] <MetaNova> then your instance is lacking that module, it was either not installed, installed incorrectly, or simply not compiled/bundled
[20:45:25] <Osy> it should be bundled
[20:45:29] <Osy> how do i add it

[21:22:54] <Osy> Ok, webadmin loaded
[21:23:27] <Osy> How can I make it so it connects to multiple networks?
[21:23:39] <MetaNova> Osy: add a new network to your user
[21:23:49] <Osy> I added everything in
[21:23:59] <Osy> and when i connect to znc, it defaults to just 1 of them
[21:24:27] <Casper> Yes, you will need to add multiple networks to your client as well, changing the <user>/<network>:password part.
[21:24:43] <Casper> They are not being aggregated, that's not possible with znc.
[21:24:49] <Osy> https://i.imgur.com/7lIwKLn.png
[21:24:59] <MetaNova> Osy: each network in ZNC requires a separate connection from your client, connecting to ZNC and giving a server password (/PASS) of zncuser/networkname:zncpass
[21:25:32] <Casper> Yeah, /server <your-router-ip>:<port> <username>/Chatoo:<password> and replace Chatoo with the other 2 as well for additional networks.
[21:25:33] <MetaNova> you can also specify a User of zncuser/networkname, and a Password of zncpass
[21:26:05] <Osy> So in mIRC for example, I could get away with /server -m zncIP username\network
[21:26:11] <MetaNova> [[Mirc]]
[21:26:11] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Mirc
[21:26:18] <Casper> You can also do /znc jumpnetwork <networkname>, but having to do that each time would be horrible I guess.
[21:26:31] <Casper> username/network:pass, yes.
[21:26:32] <MetaNova> we try to avoid jumpnetwork
[21:26:33] <Osy> Yeah, I'd like everything in one window, obv :)
[21:26:50] <MetaNova> the proper method is a separate connection for each network
[21:26:56] <Osy> Got it.
[21:27:27] <MetaNova> Osy: it can cause all sorts of unruly things, like mirroring channel lists to both channels and half of them being invalid
[21:27:36] <Casper> The page MetaNova linked for mIRC also contains a script to connect to all networks on star.

[21:27:56] <MetaNova> https://wiki.znc.in/MIRC#Connecting_to_ZNC_2
[21:28:08] <Osy> Yeah, I'll check it out. Any plans to aggregate, or will this be the status quo
[21:28:10] <MetaNova> or, the old way, which is what I used: https://wiki.znc.in/MIRC#Connecting_.28the_old_way.29
[21:29:46] <Casper> I have a whole different script even which iterates through some variables.. :P

[21:31:25] <Osy> works well, just press F1, F2, F3 etc after opening mirc, depending on which network i wanted
[21:31:44] <Osy> could've bundled all in one script
[21:31:54] <Casper> I just always start a pre-defined set of networks on start. And I always leave my client open anyways too.
[21:31:57] <Osy> but if I didn't want to connect to a specific one...
[21:32:22] <DarthGandalf> F1 connects you to some help network? :)
[21:32:28] <Osy> heh
[21:32:50] <Osy> quakenet of all
[21:32:51] <Osy> :)
[21:34:05] <Osy> Hmm, cute.
[21:34:23] <Osy> my performs (which are network based) still work even when pipelining via znc
[21:34:45] <Osy> how does znc handle performs, network side
[21:34:49] <Casper> Very basically you could do: on *:START: { var %x 1, %n net1 net2 net3 | while (%x < $numtok(%n,32)) { server $iif(%x > 1,-m) $+(User/,$gettok(%n,%x,32),:pass) | inc %x } } :P
[21:35:26] <Casper> Osy, there's [[perform]] for that. Those are executed after connecting to the network, not again when your client connects.
[21:35:26] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/perform
[21:36:15] <Osy> Cool - thx, will have a read
[21:36:29] <Osy> I meant my mIRC side performs kicked in
[21:36:55] <Casper> Yeah, if you don't want that to happen, you'll need to disable them on your client, otherwise they'll just be repeated each time your mIRC connects :p
[21:37:13] <MetaNova> Osy: ZNC handles all your network authentication now
[21:37:37] <Osy> No, yeah - very clear. I knew what the bouncer does
[21:37:48] <Osy> just a matter of setting all up
[21:38:07] <Osy> I even figured how not to have it run as root
[21:38:19] <Casper> That's simple, just not run it as root. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[21:38:22] <Osy> which goes on by default under asuswrt merlin
[21:38:28] <MetaNova> or, at least, it should - you could simply not load sasl/nickserv/perform/cert and have your client do the auth, but that's terrible
[21:38:57] <Casper> sasl is yum though.
[21:39:06] <MetaNova> wherever offered, sure is
[21:39:13] <Osy> in your experience, is znc light?
[21:39:22] <Casper> Sure is.
[21:39:26] <Osy> this is a router, after all
[21:39:28] <MetaNova> https://wiki.znc.in/ZNC_Memory_Usage
[21:39:57] <Casper> My router is a thin client, so "this is a router" is by no means a valid statement in regards of anything being light or not.. :P 
[21:40:21] <DarthGandalf> Mine is also on router
[21:41:23] <MetaNova> I was once able to install ZNC on my DD-WRT Asus T-AC66U
[21:41:44] <MetaNova> s/T-/RT-/
[21:41:44] <ZNC-Linker> MetaNova meant: “I was once able to install ZNC on my DD-WRT Asus RT-AC66U”
[21:42:09] <Casper> I've never owned a router, prior to using thin clients, that could handle anything being installed on it at all.
[21:42:18] <MetaNova> my first host was a laptop with Slackware installed on it
[21:42:50] <Casper> My first host was a Windows laptop under my bed at my mom's place. And whenever it lost connection, it was due to her finding out about the laptop and unplugging it. :^) 
[21:44:09] <DarthGandalf> Casper: I misread that as "under my mom's bed" ><
[21:44:24] <DarthGandalf> The next sentence looks especially confusing after this one

[23:39:02] <Osy> well, I suppose weechat supports multiple networks
[23:39:08] <Osy> (multiple windows)
[23:39:14] <Osy> so basically
[23:39:25] <Osy> in my client (which is mIRC)
[23:40:14] <Osy> I just do //server -m zncIP:+port username/networkname:password
[23:41:29] <Osy> for each additional network, a new command as above, and you obviously change the <networkname> string to the one matching the znc network name you want to connect to
[23:41:42] <Osy> not sure if this will apply to weechat
[23:42:00] <zsoltiv_> i see
[23:42:03] <zsoltiv_> thanks
[23:42:28] <Osy> not sure how to call them for weechat
[23:42:34] <Osy> tabs? windows?
[23:42:41] <Osy> status windows?
[23:42:47] <zsoltiv_> it calls them buffers
[23:43:11] <Osy> basically you need a new term inside weechat
[23:43:25] <Osy> and initiate a new connection to znc
[23:43:37] <Osy> but with the updated <networkname> string
[23:43:56] <zsoltiv_> okay, thank you
[23:44:09] <Osy> eg
[23:45:29] <Osy> /server 192.168.0.1:+53400 zsoltiv/oftc:<zncpassword>
[23:45:45] <Osy> replace with your details
[23:46:10] <zsoltiv_> i see
[23:46:45] <Osy> for each network, you initiate a new connection to znc, basicallt
[23:46:52] <Osy> -t+y
[23:47:23] <Osy> whether your client can collate multiple server sessions in the same window....
[23:51:10] <zsoltiv_> alright thanks for the explanation
