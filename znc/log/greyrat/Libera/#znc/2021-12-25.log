[01:34:42] <MetaNova> markofcorn: this is going to sound more rude than it is intended to, but
[01:35:01] <MetaNova> markofcorn: don't use shit IRC clients and you'll have much better experience
[01:35:13] <MetaNova> Thunderbird and Pidgin are garbage IRC clients.
[01:36:34] <gothkat> Pidgin should work though if you understand the bugs and limitations. to be clear it is NOT a good choice, but i used it for a long time when I had a bunch of contacts on multiple networks (irc and not) and couldn't keep them straight
[01:38:14] <MetaNova> well, yes, they will "work" if you know exactly what you're doing already
[01:38:38] <MetaNova> and don't need minor things like, y'know, actual error messages to point you in the right direction
[01:38:56] <MetaNova> and that's completely separate of them lacking basic IRC client functions
[01:39:02] <MetaNova> like a status/server tab
[01:39:05] <gothkat> error messages, server messages, and useful degree of scripting or a standardized interface
[01:39:20] <MetaNova> yeah, those "minor" things
[01:40:02] <gothkat> Oh and it won't connect to a single hostname more than once, so you need to use the hosts file if you want to connect to multiple networks through different znc users.
[01:40:22] <MetaNova> small hiccup.
[01:40:45] <MetaNova> "lemme just edit my system's host file because my client is a piece of shit"
[01:40:55] <MetaNova> Just Normal Pidgin Things (tm)
[01:41:56] <gothkat> i think i did it with a DNS wildcard. already had one so that i could change my vhost quickly when i used it like a status message
[01:42:50] <MetaNova> there are other (in MY opinion) enormous annoyances with using a client like Pidgin to do IRC things
[01:43:17] <MetaNova> EXAMPLE: in every single actual IRC client I have ever used, arrow-up brings me to my previously-typed line
[01:43:26] <MetaNova> Pidgin? oh, no, no no no no
[01:43:39] <MetaNova> no, you see, with Pidgin, it's ctrl+up
[01:43:54] <MetaNova> huge PITA
[01:45:19] <gothkat> Actually that was part of why i used irc for pidgin... I was living in pidgin anyway and it was the only thing that could handle my other chats and irc.
[01:45:32] <gothkat> Less annoying to use one bad interface than have to remember the differences between multiple interfaces
[01:46:03] <gothkat> But when MSN and AIM and whatever had people that I talked to all went away, it was like a breath of fresh air going back to a real IRC client
[01:46:05] <MetaNova> I did, for a time, use Pidgin for both my other instant message protocols as well as IRC
[01:46:47] <MetaNova> and was able to live in the state of denial "this is fine.jpg" (where everything is on fire)
[01:47:03] <gothkat> That sums it up
[01:47:12] <MetaNova> because I thought the convenience of a single application to do it all outweighed, y'know, an actual client
[01:47:16] <gothkat> znc fixed a lot of the other problems too
[01:49:46] <gothkat> But unless you really really need one client for many things, it is not a good choice at all. never tried thunderbird for irc. i use it for email sometimes. it was terrible at usenet back when people used that

[06:06:46] <Anarethos> Bookworm: Canada?
[06:07:59] <Anarethos> Hi all! Quick question. With clientbuffer, when I do a ClearAllBuffers, does it apply to all client config or onky the one in use?  Thanks. 
[06:08:07] <MetaNova> oh, bookworm is a The Lounge dev
[06:08:10] <MetaNova> that's cool
[06:08:22] <MetaNova> Anarethos: that's a good question
[06:08:41] <MetaNova> Anarethos: I do not know the answer to that, but, it is actually trivial to test
[06:08:53] <Anarethos> I don’t always aks stupid one :)
[06:09:35] <MetaNova> Anarethos: assuming you have a proper clientbuffer setup, with multiple clients and therefore multiple groups of buffers, simply perform '/msg *status clearallbuffers' from one client, then perform '/msg *status playbuffer #znc' in the other client
[06:09:44] <MetaNova> (replace #znc with some other channel if needed)
[06:09:49] <Anarethos> I know but before loosing time testing it I would rather ask. 
[06:09:57] <MetaNova> ah. I see.
[06:10:30] <MetaNova> I am actually a single user use-case so I have difficulty answering that definitively
[06:10:35] <Anarethos> I don’t use playbuffer
[06:10:54] <MetaNova> playbuffer doesn't come into the equation for the scope of your question, honestly
[06:11:10] <MetaNova> the module, I mean
[06:11:14] <Anarethos> Hehe ok. Will test myself then
[06:11:18] <MetaNova> I didn't think you meant the command
[06:11:19] <MetaNova> sorry
[06:11:55] <Anarethos> Just to clear the buffet on one client and chek if the buffet will play on the other one
[06:12:15] <Anarethos> Buffer and nit buffet
[06:12:18] <MetaNova> I know that a simple 'clearbuffer #chan' will clear the buffer for #chan for that client, but I don't know if ClearAllBuffers would also only affect that client
[06:12:18] <Anarethos> Anyway thaks
[06:12:23] <MetaNova> cheers
[06:12:26] <Anarethos> Gift time eith the kids
[06:12:37] <Anarethos> Happy hollyday!
[06:12:43] <Anarethos> Thanks all

[18:59:53] <ve1vet> Hi, I am trying to setup ZNC in AWS EC2 instance. How do I configure my Client hexchat to connect to the bouncer after succesfully setting up bouncer in instance?

[19:21:10] <bookworm> the same way you always connect to an IRC server
[19:21:47] <bookworm> more of a hexchat question as well so I'd suggest to start with their docs
[19:22:16] * bookworm should stop talking to ghosts
[19:28:27] <Nacorid> I feel you, just as a note though: In the server edit window enter <ZNCUser>/<ZNCNetwork> as username and select server password as authentication method and obviously insert the <ZNCPassword> :D
[19:31:08] <Nacorid> I think there's also a hexchat example in the znc docs
