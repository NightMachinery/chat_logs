[04:34:07] <snake> that makes sense actually, you are right
[04:34:10] <amigojapan> snake:ctrol plus space is probably better

[04:34:32] <amigojapan> I will look at it in android settings
[04:35:39] <snake> did i tell you i would have to take more electives in the software development track than the more advanced track?
[04:35:53] <snake> i found out i actually miscalculated that really badly, and its actually the other way around
[04:36:11] <snake> the development track is easier overall

[04:50:13] <amigojapan> good luck snake
[04:51:03] <amigojapan> snake:it was kind of my fault, that I decided to quit school in middlle school whne I was 12, general education was not my cup of tea
[04:51:15] <snake> amigojapan, oh i see
[04:51:17] <snake> sorry
[04:51:22] <amigojapan> no problem
[04:51:45] <snake> that is undestandable tho, it is hard to keep motivated
[04:51:49] <snake> for gen ed stuff
[04:52:35] <amigojapan> snake:and the GED is really easy, did you know even the math test is just writing an essay?
[04:53:36] <amigojapan> if it were not for that I probably could nto have entered higher education
[04:57:03] <amigojapan> snake:anyhow, I have studied some stuff more recently like trig, when i ended up needing it
[04:57:47] <snake> amigojapan, i did not know that
[04:58:09] <amigojapan> yup yup
[04:58:17] <snake> and yeah i tend to figure things out as i need them, but also sometimes i dont know what to look for, so i do see the value in it being offered at uni
[04:58:20] <snake> its just so much work ;-;
[04:58:41] <amigojapan> yup
[04:58:47] <amigojapan> I can only imagine
[04:58:48] <snake> there was like 15 minutes left and i was still on problem 2 xD fortunately i passed that exam and decided to request extra time for math exams
[04:59:34] <amigojapan> snake: I am fortunate to have a friend that teaches me math stuff when I need it. he is a math major

[06:30:37] <Fenderbassist> I wouldn't worry too much about it, but contacting them to let them know was a good thing
[06:30:54] <Fenderbassist> yeah but that business might make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year

[12:36:39] <BillyZane2> pokhu, the one i linked, i have not seen it yet
[12:36:48] *** BillyZane2 is now known as BillyZane
[12:37:09] <pokhu> BillyZane: i dropped the cosplay manga because i didnt like it
[12:37:22] <emmeka> After 13 long years of waiting and a cliffhanger ending, Spice and Wolf Season 3 is confirmed.
[12:37:22] <BillyZane> pokhu, really? i'm only 3 episodes in
[12:37:33] <MootPoot>  oh really
[12:37:36] <pokhu> BillyZane: the male lead was boring and they do nothing and the female lead is also boring and annoying
[12:37:42] <BillyZane> pokhu, i guess so
[12:37:44] <MootPoot> so its the sequel with the kid?
[12:37:45] <BillyZane> pokhu, but i like it
[12:37:47] <pokhu> no i dropped it after like 5 chapters, i did it very fast
[12:37:53] <pokhu> BillyZane: whats the appeal???
[12:38:02] <emmeka> MootPoot probably not, or hopefully not.
[12:38:08] <BillyZane> pokhu, it has a good lesson
[12:38:17] <emmeka> MootPoot where the anime left off there's still like idk 10 volumes of the original series unadapted
[12:38:23] <pokhu> BillyZane: lesson? i thought it was a fashoin manga
[12:38:26] <BillyZane> pokhu, it is better to be yourself and find people that appreciate you for who you are.
[12:38:43] <pokhu> why did they pick a fashoin manga for that 
[12:38:56] <pokhu> i dont know i might watch it 
[12:38:59] <emmeka> MootPoot at least, the sequel series wouldn't make any sense unless they finish that stuff first
[12:40:14] <emmeka> pokhu it's more of a romcom with a message about self-confidence than a "show about fashion"
[12:40:21] <BillyZane> pokhu, that's the main plot element. the second element is the guy that you really want to succeed, who doesn't have friends, who's kind of innocent, and find him the right girl for him, and that girl is perfect. she accepts him for who he is, they can both genuinely do together what gives each of them joy.
[12:44:15] <emmeka> MootPoot the sequel series focuses largely on a character (Col) who is introduced and becomes a major character in the last 1/3 of the original series. The anime thus far ends before he appears, so, they need to finish out the story first so he makes sense before the sequel series is an option.
[12:44:24] <BillyZane> this other anime, 'runway de waratte' is about this girl who was going to become a model, was set up for that, but she doesn't grow past 5'2" and is trying to become the world's shortest model or somethin..
[12:45:06] <pokhu> i think i just cant enjoy romcoms currently
[12:45:16] <emmeka> what a terrible affliction, pokhu

[12:47:14] <MootPoot> I fixed it
[12:47:18] <MootPoot> fuck you LG
[12:48:35] <MootPoot> LG never bothered to update the camera app on my phone so it could take longer then 12min long videos due to the android app limitation
[12:49:02] <MootPoot> android limitation* - used to only be able to handle a max of 4gb files
[12:49:21] <MootPoot> so recording was capped and they never implmented a video snipping function thing like other camera apps do
[12:49:26] <emmeka> that's not really an android limitation though, that's just FAT32?
[12:49:54] <MootPoot> emmeka: that's the thing, its a holdover from fat32 that used to be a filesystem limitation
[12:50:03] <MootPoot> but hasent been for like 5-6 years
[12:50:20] <MootPoot> and they just never updated the camera interface on the android kernel thingamajiggy
[12:50:26] <MootPoot> to exceed that 4gb cap
[12:51:04] <MootPoot> so 3rd party camera apps were just using splits to get around it
[12:51:17] <MootPoot> LG pulls a fast one and locks off 4k60 recording to only their camera app
[12:51:33] <MootPoot> so I couldn't use alts
[12:52:00] <MootPoot> and android 11 fixes this - BUT lg kicked the bucket as you all know , stopped making phones
[12:52:10] <MootPoot> so they never bothered to update their camera app accordingly
[12:52:18] <MootPoot> emmeka: https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/09/26/android-11-got-rid-of-the-4gb-limit-on-videos-but-the-google-camera-app-is-still-capped/#:~:text=Video%20files%20recorded%20on%20Android,time%20of%20about%2013%20minutes.
[12:52:19] <ImoutoBot> [title] Android 11 got rid of the 4GB limit on videos, but the Google Camera app is still capped
[12:52:21] <emmeka> did they?
[12:52:26] <emmeka> I didn't know this.
[12:52:40] <emmeka> (that LG exited the phone market)
[12:52:49] <MootPoot> emmeka: they announced they are pulling out of the smartphone business like last year
[12:52:56] <MootPoot> and already left
[12:53:17] <MootPoot> I have their last flagship phone - they promised one more year of updates for me so I'm  hanging on
[12:54:36] <emmeka> I'm just amazed that Spice & Wolf 3 is happening. I have waited... so long...
[12:54:44] *** Joins: MikeEcho (~IceChat95@17-77-178-143.ftth.glasoperator.nl)
[12:54:45] <MootPoot> so basically what I ended up doing is using a macro / automation app to just press that button on and off on 10min splits
[12:54:46] <emmeka> really what's up with all these long lost sequels out of left field
[12:54:58] <MootPoot> which does have a 5 second cut in the video but I can work with that
[12:55:19] <MootPoot> emmeka: its like hollywood bringing back all those old franchises but they aren't shit this time
[12:55:25] <MootPoot> ez monie
[12:55:39] <MootPoot> although spice and wolf was one of the first anime I REALLY liked
[12:56:05] <MootPoot> characters were written well, it didnt insult your intelligence, I actually gave a shit about holo ( horo? )
[12:56:20] <MootPoot> I still dont know if its holo, horo , or hollow

[12:57:07] <emmeka> Log Horizon, Devil is a Part Timer, Classroom of the Elite, Spice and Wolf... all these shows without sequels for like 5 years and then suddenly
[12:57:43] <pokhu> part timers getting a sequel?
[12:57:56] <emmeka> MootPoot Spice and Wolf was the first LN I ever read. I was so enamoured with the anime that I *had* to know how it ended. I ended up buying a copy of the anniversary collector's edition hardcover.
[12:57:56] <MootPoot> inb4 there is a no game no life one
[12:58:11] <Sapphirus> Log Horizon I could never get into.
[12:58:21] <emmeka> MootPoot after reading it, I resold it, and by then it had become collectible. I made $200 profit off that book. Kraft Lawrence would be proud.

[23:57:54] <Bco1981> i just see it, audio and video starts a bit out of sync, but ends up in sync.
[23:58:19] <Bco1981> the video is laggin behind the audio.
[23:59:18] <Bco1981> but, i don't want a phone bigger then 5"... and that' like nothing out there better than what i have.
