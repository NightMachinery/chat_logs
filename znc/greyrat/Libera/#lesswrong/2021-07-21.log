[00:18:19] <dbohdan> gwern: "I thought the actual NN was processing evilness"  Sadly, no.  But the actual paper is still interesting.  The obvious-in-retrospect insight is, "For steganography, NNs are better than the usual target, images".  Image steganography typically uses the least significant bit of certain bytes, allowing a payload of up to 1/8 the size of the image (usually less).  Here you have 1/3 with only a 1% loss of the model's accuracy.  According to 
[00:18:19] <dbohdan> <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2018.09.091>, in modern video steganography the payload size is 1%-2% of the video file.
[00:18:20] <Robomot> Redirecting
[00:20:54] <nshepperd> basically distribution of NNs is not highly optimised
[00:21:08] <dbohdan> Yep
[00:21:54] <nshepperd> but for something like the speech nn in Android you'll probably get closer to the image steganography figure, since it's already crushed down and optimised to few significant digits
[00:24:44] <dbohdan> Right, this makes sense.  The 1%-2% figure for video shows how relatively little you have to work with with efficient lossy compression.
[00:25:57] <Gurkenglas> surely the % is smaller after distillation?

[04:39:34] <shawwwn> It seems unfounded for stockfish to demand that any code used to train a neural network be made open source merely because the model is being used in a GPL’d codebase
[04:39:37] <Betawolf> not yet
[04:40:31] <Betawolf> but it would provide them with the ultimate user experience control
[04:40:45] <gwern> Betawolf: someday! that pesky speed of light
[04:41:18] <Betawolf> it gets a lot easier if you stop the users being able to do things
[04:41:55] <shawwwn> If stockfish could argue that the training code be made open source, then any GPL codebase could argue that every DLL used by the project must be open source in order to sell it
[04:42:55] <gwern> stockfish requires huge amounts of compute to train. I doubt self-confessed thieves like chessbase (who've already had to settle other thefts) actually trained from scratch instead of distributing the original weights
[04:44:01] <shawwwn> I too suspect that they fine tuned the original model. But that’s not a justified suspicion. It’s merely a suspicion
[04:44:18] <shawwwn> If they did, it should be immediately obvious that the latent space is nearly identical
[04:44:58] <gwern> (I don't think stockfish has a latent space. if you can't look at the binary directly, where it should be pretty obvious, you could just look at the board values over a large dataset of chess positions, or something like that)
[04:45:27] <shawwwn> You can measure the cosine similarity of each layer
[04:45:41] <shawwwn> A fine tuned model should mostly share cosine sim
[04:46:10] <gwern> that's not a latent space but sure, that's one of the ways you'd look at the binary directly
[04:46:21] <shawwwn> I mildly wish I had $80 to throw around, just to analyze that
[04:47:02] <gwern> personally, I'd get a copy of the lawsuit filings first to see what analysis they already did
[04:47:25] <gwern> if you run `strings` on it and it spits out 'STOCKFISHSTOCKFISHSTOCKFISH' everywhere, probably not much need
[04:47:29] <shawwwn> From where I’m sitting, it seems possible (though unlikely) that chessbase trained a model from scratch, and then wanted to sell that model. They released all source code, and the model weights, making them GPLv3 compliant. I hope they have a better case for court.

[04:58:40] <catern> sure, but then the weights form a combined work with Stockfish and would be covered under the GPL (well, I'm assuming the weights are compiled into the Stockfish binary - if they aren't then it's not clear)
[04:59:59] <shawwwn> Yeah… I’m not certain whether the weights are compiled directly into the binary, or distributed as a separate file. I think if it’s a separate file then it should count as “source code”
[05:00:01] <catern> also, the GPL contains terms about license termination, but you can still terminate the license outside of those terms - just, like, in general
[05:00:14] <shawwwn> Can you?
[05:01:02] <shawwwn> For example, if you distribute some code under MIT, can you sue someone who uses it on the grounds that you’ve terminated your license with them? It’s really quite a tricky situation…

[07:06:38] <PlanckWalk> Regarding revoking license for GPL works: "All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met". 
[07:07:02] <PlanckWalk> So no, you can't revoke a GPL license to a specific organization.
[07:07:57] <PlanckWalk> All you can do is argue that they aren't meeting the conditions.

[07:12:53] <PlanckWalk> Whether NN weights count as protected under copyright seems like a tough question.  I suspect it would depend upon how they are derived and whether the training data is covered under copyright.
[07:14:22] <PlanckWalk> If it is, then under the GPL it probably counts as "source code".
[07:15:23] <PlanckWalk> "The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it".  The preferred form for modifying (or recreating) the weights is by supplying training data.
[07:17:48] <gwern> I haven't seen any serious suggestions that NN weights couldn't be copyrighted, anymore than binaries can't be. they very obviously pass any kind of de minimis creative contribution - a *lot* of skill and choice goes into the creation of any set of NN weights
[07:18:25] <gwern> they have a fixed form, they can be written down, etc
[07:19:16] <shawwwn> where it gets kind of interesting is whether NNs should count as source code or not
[07:19:34] <PlanckWalk> I think not, at least by GPL definition.
[07:19:52] <PlanckWalk> Other licenses may have different definitions.

[07:20:26] <shawwwn> for example, GPT-J ships quantized bfloat16 weights, because otherwise it'd be like 50GB. But one could argue that the quantized weights aren't "source code" and that the unquantized weights are, since that's what you need in order to continue fine-tuning the NN
[07:20:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Is that really a savings
[07:20:40] <shawwwn> it gets... weird fast
[07:20:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: It looks ugly and chaotic, too :\
[07:20:42] <gwern> well, it saves 1 line in that example
[07:21:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> But not reliably...
[07:21:39] <gwern> shawwwn: I think that's pretty reasonable. I mean, the full-precision weights are the preferred modification form. there's nothing else. if you train from scratch, you'll get an entirely different model, which produces rather different outputs for any specific input, because it's a sample from a different part of the bayesian posterior
[07:22:21] <PlanckWalk> Is the training process usually deterministic?
[07:22:26] <shawwwn> hell naw
[07:22:33] <PlanckWalk> Ah okay
[07:23:02] <shawwwn> actually that was one of the first things I learned from gwern. when we were trying to train GPT 1.5GB, I was kind of obsessed with it seeing every training example exactly once
[07:23:16] <shawwwn> he pointed out that you can just randomly sample, and it gives equivalent performance
[07:23:25] <PlanckWalk> I was imagining that if you provided exactly the same training data with exactly the same parameters, you might get the same weights etc.
[07:23:47] <shawwwn> theoretically yes. but it's remarkably difficult in practice to pull that off
[07:23:49] <PlanckWalk> But yeah, if you have any randomness in there then that's bust.
[07:24:26] <shawwwn> well, it's not just randomness -- you'd need virtually the same hardware too, because e.g. with TPU pods you have to deal with "which training shard should host 0 see?" (there are 4 hosts)
[07:24:28] <PlanckWalk> Or even if in theory it's deterministic, but common in practice to throw away the information during runtime.
[07:24:38] <PlanckWalk> Worse than I though, right.
[07:24:46] <shawwwn> so if the training data is sharded across 4 hosts, then each host will see different samples
[07:24:52] <shawwwn> than if you just train on a GPU locally

[13:17:00] *** Joins: Thurl (~Nivim@174-24-94-209.clsp.qwest.net)
[13:17:45] <feep[work]> the direction in which D went as compared to C++ is that languages should be driven more by compilers than by designers
[13:18:09] <feep[work]> ie. all the stuff that was built into D is ... "well, the compiler can easily tell you this. so why doesn't it?" now it does.
[13:18:37] <feep[work]> traits, typeof, auto, could all have been in c easily, probably like half a day for an experienced compiler dev
[13:18:57] <feep[work]> but of course, C's action loop is literally measured in years.
[13:19:28] <feep[work]> I think D has done great strides by taking any notion of a design committee out of the language design loop
[13:19:37] <feep[work]> my goal with neat is to take myself out of that loop as well.
[13:19:43] <PapuaHardyNet> I wonder what you think of C lovers like the suckless commune
[13:19:59] <feep[work]> I mean
[13:20:03] <feep[work]> I use KDE. I think that says all.
[13:20:10] <PapuaHardyNet> ow
[13:20:17] <feep[work]> I don't like C for its sparsity, I like it for its straightforwardness. Those are not the same.
[13:20:34] <feep[work]> neat tries to still be straightforward, same as D.
[13:20:43] <feep[work]> no magic, or if magic, then at least no nonlocal magic.
[13:20:55] <PapuaHardyNet> right, that is why I like golang
[13:21:02] <feep[work]> sure but golang is shit tho
[13:21:19] <feep[work]> like, we're talking about a language that ... 
[13:21:39] <feep[work]> its *developer* said they kept features out of it because they were *too complicated for googlers*.
[13:21:59] <PapuaHardyNet> but that's a good thing imo
[13:22:10] <feep[work]> okay, um. I do not share that philosophy. :p
[13:22:17] <PapuaHardyNet> the simpler the mental model of the programming language, the less footguns you have (look at C)
[13:22:26] <feep[work]> um, C has a simple model
[13:22:31] <feep[work]> it just has utterly inane primitives.
[13:22:38] <PapuaHardyNet> I tried using pthreads once

[13:28:21] <PapuaHardyNet> you approve of extremely powerful features that can be footguns, as long as the developer has put safeties in place
[13:28:29] <PapuaHardyNet> sure that makes sense
[13:28:34] <feep[work]> that sounds correct, yes.

[18:28:05] <Robomot> Feature Interaction Bugs • Hillel Wayne (In most testing frameworks, you’re expected to write a lot of low-level tests and few high-level tests. The reasoning is that end-to-end tests are slow and expensive and only cover a tiny amount of the program’s state space. It’s better to focus on testing all the parts in isolation versus testing that they all work together.)
[18:28:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> "After a while, we find a new issue. Our email server is a box in the kitchen. Sometimes someone mistakes it for the microwave and pours their SoupOn all over it, frazzing the database. If this happens, people might not receive the activation email." ... yeah I hate it when that happens

[18:30:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> I actually don't understand this example they give
[18:30:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Isn't the problem that they let people change their email address before validating?
[18:30:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why would that be allowed?
[18:30:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why would *any* account modification actions be allowed before validating, if validation is required?
[18:31:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Where’s the root cause? The registration is working fine, so it’s not there. The “change email” is fine, since part of our requirements are that people can switch to anonymous emails." ... well, no, the requirement is that people be able to switch to anonymous emails *after validating*, so actually this just looks like you failed to implement your requirements properly, and just ... didn't build your system correctly
[18:31:50] <Obormot\Arcturus>  at all?
[18:32:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> "No part of our system is _obviously_ broken." ... wrong, the part where you let people change their emails before they've validated is obviously broken
[18:33:02] <kuudes> XD
[18:33:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Speaking of changing emails, let’s put that in. We want to prevent them from fat-fingering an address they don’t control. They need to confirm that their new email address is what they changed it to." ... you handle this by having them make a new account, with the correct email
[18:33:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean, am I wrong? Is this not the standard way?
[18:34:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Isn't this example just describing a clear bug?
[18:34:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or, like, a clear ... implementation mistake?
[18:34:45] <feep[work]> I haven't read the page

[18:35:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Furthermore, even IF we want this behavior
[18:35:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Then the correct solution is to say "IF user has not yet validated, THEN always check whether the email is a spammer email, and reject it"
[18:35:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> That avoids the out-of-sync issue with checking in two places in the code
[18:36:07] <two2thehead> kuudes, i'm starting to think this brexit plan isn't oven-ready
[18:36:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Only permit validated users to change their emails to anonymous/throwaway ones
[18:36:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> I dunno, this seems like a very bad example of "feature interaction bugs"
[18:36:32] <two2thehead> also dominic cummings is a twat
[18:37:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> "FI is more common when requirements are ambiguous or constantly changing. Customers “think locally” about changes to the system. They’re not thinking about how feature X would interact with something you implemented six weeks ago. This means that Agile teams have to be especially watchful for FI, as their highly iterative development style leaves a lot of space for cross-sprint bugs." ... now this is a good point
[18:37:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And is one of the many reasons why Agile is bad)

[19:18:05] <Gurkenglas> no idea but it's gotta be possible. at least you should be able to set up the image and animation as separate backgrounds and probably someone put the switching between those on hotkeys before
[19:18:26] <shawwwn> true
[19:18:37] <Gurkenglas> (and once you have those hotkeys you can make a macro on the operating system level)
[19:19:13] <Gurkenglas> is it weird because of the lighting or the perspective?
[19:20:21] <Gurkenglas> oh maybe because there is so little noise in the background that the skin border is jarring

[19:20:55] <feep[work]> lol, I have now run into this specific code issue twice with two separate testing frameworks
[19:21:30] <feep[work]> it goes like this: rest service is being tested. rest service throws an exception, rest service shuts down its port and logs the exception.
[19:22:11] <feep[work]> logging the exception has to gather backtrace, so it starts reading debug info. this can take a few ms. in the meantime, the testing harness detects that the connection has been closed, decides the test has failed, and performs cleanup, killing the process.
[19:22:14] <Gurkenglas> maybe you could go into blender and make your own turned off holodeck with correct  perspective and noisier textures
[19:22:15] <feep[work]> ... before it can log the error.
[19:23:32] <dbohdan> Ouch
[19:24:46] <Gurkenglas> is there any star trek episode where something tries to use kaleidoscopic illusions like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehJ5Ysw5XyI against the crew?

[19:27:15] <Gurkenglas> feep[work], are you in control of any of this code, so that you could put the exception logging in a finally block?
[19:27:25] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: it's already in a finally block
[19:27:35] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: so is the connection close, and that one is further down the callstack.
[19:27:45] <shawwwn> dbohdan: rofl
[19:27:59] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: anyway, I fixed it by just not closing the connection if we notice we're going down.
[19:28:17] <Gurkenglas> ...is there any situation where that sort of callstack prioritization of finally blocks is correct?
[19:28:17] <feep[work]> I was just amused that I'd run into this twice with two totally different test frameworks.
[19:28:32] <feep[work]> ... "correct"? I don't follow. it's how unwinding works.
[19:29:10] <feep[work]> that's just what it does, it unwinds the stack frame by frame.
[19:29:20] <Gurkenglas> oh, further down means started later, that makes sense.
[19:29:33] <feep[work]> yeah, I wasn't sure about that phrasing XD

[19:29:54] <feep[work]> control flows downwards, etc
[19:30:10] <Gurkenglas> but uh how does the inner finally block kill the process without letting the outer finally block execute
[19:30:19] <feep[work]> nono, other way around
[19:30:24] * feep[work] blinks
[19:30:24] <feep[work]> no
[19:30:25] <feep[work]> yes
[19:30:33] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: nevermind the last four lines lol.
[19:30:50] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: what happens is the *test harness* kills the process. this is a totally different process wrapping the system under test.
[19:31:24] <Gurkenglas> ah so the test is basically running on a vm and the inner finally block is talking to god and god doesn't know what finally means
[19:31:32] <feep[work]> XD yes
[19:32:05] <feep[work]> all the test says is "the REST connection has died." and it just goes "thaaat's a fail, kill -9."
[19:32:11] <feep[work]> sees*
[19:32:16] <Gurkenglas> and the test harness is not under your control? because surely the proper response is to have the inner finally block throw a TestFailedDueToClosedConnectionException
[19:32:28] <feep[work]> nono, the test harness is under my control
[19:32:46] <feep[work]> but the test harness is straight up not even the same binary as the service being tested.
[19:33:01] <feep[work]> its interaction with the service is exec and kill.
[19:33:05] <feep[work]> (and connect)
[19:33:26] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: we run tests with the same binary that will later be deployed to customers.
[19:33:52] <feep[work]> so the test is wrapped around that on the outside.
[19:33:55] <Gurkenglas> isn't there some other kill signal than 9 that tells it to throw an exception so that it can execute its finallies?
[19:34:03] <feep[work]> nothing reliable.
[19:34:12] <feep[work]> in any case, you can't throw from a signal handler.
[19:34:46] <feep[work]> I mean-- you *can*, but it's incredibly risky and may break at the slightest provocation.
[19:34:54] <feep[work]> the stackframe that the signal handler is invoked in does *not* have to be valid.
[19:35:35] <feep[work]> anyway, it's all good.
[19:36:03] <Gurkenglas> feel free to shut my mouth but it does seem pretty important to have a general way to kill a process running on your OS without skipping its finally blocks
[19:36:38] <feep[work]> well, the normal way is to just do an orderly shutdown
[19:36:54] <feep[work]> ie. sigterm, kill 15.
[19:37:04] <Gurkenglas> i knew it :) but?
[19:37:26] <feep[work]> but you need application support for it and it's a hassle
[19:37:28] <Gurkenglas> (by i knew it i mean my line containing "9" was finding the existence of a "15" probable)
[19:37:33] <feep[work]> ^^
[19:37:48] <feep[work]> afaict the saner design is to just write your services so they're atomic
[19:37:56] <feep[work]> ie. an action is either completely executed or not at all
[19:38:04] <feep[work]> then you're resilient in the face of crashes
[19:38:14] <feep[work]> and at that point, why bother implementing shutdown? just crash out.
[19:38:31] <Gurkenglas> what enforces that kill -9 doesn't interrupt an action?
[19:38:36] <feep[work]> absolutely nothing.
[19:38:45] <feep[work]> which is what I meant by "write services so they're atomic".
[19:39:09] <feep[work]> the usual way this is done is by preparing the modified system state you're targeting, and then change to the new state in a single operation.
[19:39:11] <Gurkenglas> so you havent written services so they're atomic if there exists a user who could say kill -9
[19:39:27] <feep[work]> well, the OS does offer you atomic primitives.
[19:39:33] <feep[work]> you can't kill -9 in the middle of a kernel operation.
[19:39:44] <feep[work]> for instance, filesystem rename is atomic.
[19:40:02] <Gurkenglas> ah. so you'd want to register a finally block with the kernel
[19:40:09] <feep[work]> effectively, sort of, yes.
[19:40:23] <feep[work]> really, there's a bunch of techniques here and not all of them can be expressed in terms of finally blocks :)
[19:40:42] <Gurkenglas> ...have you heard of the Cont monad?
[19:40:55] <feep[work]> nnno?
[19:44:15] <Gurkenglas> just an association i drew just now, the ContT monad transformer adds an operation to your monad which interrupts the calculation with a result, and happens to be able to emulate many other monads, so in a sense finally can be used to emulate a lot of things
[19:44:39] <feep[work]> :)
[19:45:08] <feep[work]> I don't really think of finally that way.
[19:45:44] <feep[work]> to me it's just a code block that gets attached to returns and also registered as a callback with the eh runtime

[21:32:32] <Logos01> It's a bit like how people think that if we institute nationalized/single-payer healthcare in the US we'll get a system that will actually fix the things that are broken with American healthcare.

[21:33:46] <Logos01> Gurkenglas: "51% attacks"?
[21:35:06] <Logos01> Gurkenglas: I don't understand the question.
[21:35:16] <Gurkenglas> a term from crypto where whoever controls 51% of the coordination machinery can invalidate the system. if the democracy says that 51% are omnipotent then that can lead to decisions that wouldn't happen if a benevolent king was trying to aggregate everyone's opinions

[21:35:51] <Logos01> Oh. I don't know about representative democracies in general, but in the US in specific there's a lot of legislature procedure that prevents that sort of thing from happening.
[21:36:02] <Logos01> Especially in the US Senate it's basically impossible.
[21:36:05] <kuudes> I think on two party systems you get that about every time?
[21:36:10] <Gurkenglas> so how often do you get, like, 51% passing a decision which slightly helps them and strongly harms the 49%
[21:36:11] <Logos01> See also: Senatorial Holds and Filibusters.
[21:36:29] <kuudes> iirc those can be bypassed sometimes
[21:36:37] <Logos01> Filibusters yes.
[21:36:44] <Logos01> Holds only by persuading the senator to release it.
[21:36:44] <kuudes> and the constitution does not have specifica protections to those

[21:37:57] <Gurkenglas> does it count as #lw-politics if i'm not talking about the US system in particular?
[21:38:12] <Logos01> Gurkenglas: Filibusters require a successful Cloture to override, in the US system.
[21:38:21] <kuudes> over here in finland there is the constitutional committee of parliament which interprets if a proposed law is within the constitution and gets 50%> vote or not and gets either (2/3>)^2 or 5/6>
[21:38:25] <Logos01> In Congress that means that 60 senators out of 100 must vote in favor of the Cloture.
[21:38:40] <Gurkenglas> sure but that just makes it a 61%
[21:38:44] <Logos01> The exact rules on this sort of thing vary by government, as it's purely parliamentary procedure.
[21:38:55] <Logos01> Gurkenglas: That only gets past the filibuster, it doesn't actually allow the vote itself.
[21:38:59] <kuudes> in uk iirc the upper house can debate as long as they want but lower house has power to alter the system to remove upper hous
[21:39:09] <Gurkenglas> im wondering rather whether there is a country or hypothetical system that tries to actually solve the utility aggregation problem
[21:39:12] <Logos01> BUT -- 60% is still a strong majority.
[21:39:34] <Logos01> Gurkenglas: Anyhow, what you're talking about is more typically referred to as "the tyranny of the majority"
[21:39:50] <kuudes> germany and constitutional court?
[21:39:55] <Logos01> And it's why constitutional representative democracies are considered "better" than just straight representative democracies.
[21:40:01] <kuudes> and generally human rights approaches of constitutions?
[21:40:07] <Logos01> Precisely.
[21:41:02] <Gurkenglas> seems like more of a patchwork growth to combat symptoms
[21:41:06] <kuudes> personally I have started to be pro such that we would allow some international system, as long as that system has more than 200 independent human members, a veto over law being regular law and not constitutional change
[21:41:39] <Gurkenglas> kuudes, rephrase?
[21:41:41] <Logos01> Gurkenglas: That's because it is.
[21:42:05] <Gurkenglas> rider bills seem like one way to approach the general problem I'm talking about
[21:42:14] <kuudes> Gurkenglas, currently parliament nominates the constitutional committee among parliamentarians based on the party amounts in parliament. so it is not 51% proof technically
[21:42:42] <Logos01> Gurkenglas: There's a reason why "Democracy is the worst of all possible forms of government -- excepting every other form of government that's ever been tried." exists as a saying.
[21:42:43] <kuudes> I would replace or amend constitutional committee with eu court or similar thing which is out of reach the finnish parliament
[21:43:04] <Gurkenglas> it's not about human rights
[21:43:12] <kuudes> the system is that if such body does not provide its assent, law needs 5/6 majority, otherwise 1/2
[21:43:28] <Logos01> Gurkenglas: This is also technically why you have in the US both popular and geographic representation -- as that was an attempt to curtail the influence of populism over geographically distributed cultures.
[21:43:34] <kuudes> I don't think we have rider bills here
[21:43:50] <kuudes> wisconsin rule would work for that
[21:44:09] <Gurkenglas> it would be nice if we had a system where if we managed to convince 20% of representatives that running that ai would destroy the world while the other 80% think that preventing this would hurt the economy and curtail corporate freedom, that we could do an EV calculation and get it prevented
[21:44:15] <Logos01> But nowadays you see people wanting the "1 person 1 vote" policy and think that this makes it okay for, for example, urban population centers to be deciding how rural farmers ought to live.
[21:44:18] <kuudes> human rights are specifically protections against tyranny of majority
[21:44:24] <Logos01> Etc., etc., etc..
[21:44:29] <Logos01> Anyhoo. 
[21:44:31] <kuudes> ie the parable of two wolves and a pig having a democracy on what to eat
[21:45:04] <Logos01> Gurkenglas: You're wishing for rationality to exist in governance.
[21:45:09] <Logos01> That can only happen in tyrannies.
[21:45:18] <kuudes> Gurkenglas, oh, you want the end of the world to be prevented?
[21:45:29] <kuudes> have you noticed that us president can do that unilaterally on whim?
[21:45:42] <kuudes> ie "nuke everyone"
[21:46:15] <Gurkenglas> of course having one country adopt such a system wouldnt help, but it'd be nice to have one up our sleeves in case someone suddenly takes over the world *cough*
[21:46:27] <kuudes> to such extent that the us military brass prepared a plan through which to defect the constitution the least

[22:17:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: What I find bizarre about these stories is that they seem to have to *speculate* about the motivations of the decision-makers involved, which is ... frustrating. I was rereading Scott's previous stuff about PTSD and child abuse and kind of the same thing struck me. Like, you posit a past social context where everyone is ok with what is clearly child abuse, but then you have this giant gap where the motivations and views
[22:17:12] <Obormot\Arcturus>  of the people involved are totally unaccounted for
[22:17:32] <gwern> we went over this, it's to own the fascists by free-love

[22:19:01] <gwern> (ah, I see esr's blog woes continue. man what even does he do all day)
[22:19:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or take for instance the claim (cited in the SSC book review of that book about PTSD) that supposedly 20% to 50% of boomers were raped or sexually abused as children (by family members / etc.)
[22:19:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> The question then is, who are the perpetrators of all of this?
[22:20:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> We're not talking about a few prolific abusers, since, again, it's family or otherwise close people, so... taking those numbers seriously requires us to conclude that a *massive* number of ordinary people are actually sociopaths?

Here is evidence of how much they did! Wow they're just like us modern people, turns out people are people all the time, etc. etc.

[23:19:29] <ggreer> also today I learned that a lot of webcams differentiate between exposure time (how long over time they integrate the image) and gain (which is basically ISO). you can get higher framerates with fast exposure time, but then the image is dimmer. by upping the gain, you brighten the image but it becomes noisier
