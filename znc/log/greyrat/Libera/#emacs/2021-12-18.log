[00:02:47] <mwnaylor> When I write Python code, emacs is my default environment. I gravitate toward Clojure for a few reasons. 1) Short term paid Scala introduced me to immutable structures. 2) Hacking my .emacs to customize means a lot of experience with lisp. 3) Clojure built on the jvm. I get I/O functions I'm used to. I never was able to comfortably do I/O with CommonLisp or Scheme.

[00:51:55] <mwnaylor> Python is good for first class functions. Not so good, at immutable, imho. Based upon my immutable experienc w/ Scala and Clojure. PLE
[00:52:10] <mwnaylor> PLEASE correct me
[00:54:02] <wasamasa> I'd say it's not good for first-class functions either since idiomatic code avoids anything close to functional
[00:54:20] <grym> fsvo idiom
[00:54:20] <wasamasa> but since it's a lisp-1, you can do first-class functions stuff in a less awkward way than in, say, ruby
[00:54:25] <artefact> also, one-line lambdas, lol
[00:54:29] <wasamasa> yes
[00:54:42] <mwnaylor> I'm OK with objects under the hood. Clojure is built on jvm. Unless dealing with jvm interop, Clojure hides those implementation details in abstractions.

[02:02:56] <acdw> mwnaylor I also use the default *, **, ***, .... headers in org-mode, but it's good to have options. Emacs is the programmable editor after all
[02:03:41] *** Joins: Pickchea (~private@user/pickchea)
[02:04:22] <acdw> my main reasons not to use variable width are that, with org-mode tags, they can't align flush-right with variable-width fonts (the newer stuff in 29 might solve that), and there have been times that using all caps for a bit in the line have made it wrap badly. i use auto-fill-mode because i like it
[02:04:29] *** Joins: mz` (~mz`@user/mz/x-8532539)
[02:04:56] <acdw> like, i just think that having primitives for figuring pixel widths and heights would be goood to have. Emacs is a GUI application, it has to know these things anyway
[02:05:08] <mwnaylor> acdw: I don't care whether you use fixed or variable. As long as you get to make the choice. emacs seems to respect choice, with customize allowing change of font faces. For me fixed is the way to go.

[05:47:57] <tali713> elisp doesn't need tags, generally speaking.  also, those bindings are beginning/end-of-buffer
[05:48:12] <patp> is melpa and elpa still current repositories?
[05:49:11] <junebug> They should make a candy called esnacks for emacs users
[05:49:47] <s-liao> What do you mean that? I need to go the definition of the func, which is in the file.
[05:49:54] <tali713> s-liao: but in an elisp file M-. should by defult go to defun and M-, steps back in that chain.
[05:50:27] <s-liao> Let me try it
[05:50:32] <tali713> s-liao: I mean, those bindings don't make sense to me, for the context you are trying to descibe.  which means I don't know what you mean by those commands.  seperately.  emacs already can find defuns.

[05:54:15] <tali713> okay, yes, that likewise works fine and doesn't require generating tags.

[05:55:36] <tali713> ahh, I see.  I just assumed.  glad your issue is resolved
[05:56:32] <tali713> s-liao: because emacs always knows it's own state.  and it's assumed that you will be checking your code as you go, so it never occurred to me that one might write an entire file before loading it.
[05:57:15] <catern> the emacs knows its own state, and its knows what it isn't. by subtracting what it is from what it isn't, it etc etc etc

[06:01:09] <Shortstop> yeah basically tali713 
[06:01:16] <bpalmer> Shortstop: todo list is org ; calculator is calc; those are two of the most complicated elisp projects in existence.

[06:02:24] <tali713> I like bpalmer's suggestions for sure.
[06:02:36] <homerj> you learn to read marked text, do something, edit a file
[06:02:39] <bpalmer> but yeah, a cipher is potentially nice, since it's fundamentally text operations
[06:02:58] <grym> > But I'm not like most people, I'd think about writing simple editting functions first.  
[06:03:01] <Shortstop> homerj: ah gotcha, like commented sections, which are then swapped out

[06:56:38] <dale> tali713: I think it would be hard, though, to make paredit work in this case because I feel sure it wants to call things like parse-partial-sexp, syntax-ppss, or forward/backward-sexp, and parse-partial-sexp and scan-list and such are all in C IIRC.
[06:56:52] <dale> I mean, you could make it work but I think maybe you're going to have to do a bunch of new work.
[06:57:10] <tali713> never-the-less the simplest solution (besides prepending comment characters to output, which is an awful solution) is to give a face or some other property to output (might as well mark it read only too) and then just check for that, same as comments are checked for.
[06:58:04] <dale> I am betting you need to literally attach a syntax text property to make the text comment syntax.
[06:58:07] <tali713> really, I'm a bit annoyed that the first repl I tested (ielm) doesn't have a repl-out-face or any other such.
[06:58:19] <dale> Hm, interesting, what does IELM do...

[07:00:57] <tali713> i knew it had the same problem, that's why I started looking there, it's built in, so a good place to hope for normalish behavior.
[07:01:13] <dale> I wonder if SLIME/SLY have fixed this somehow.
[07:01:52] <tali713> and indeed it does have field output in it's plist.  that's enough to update paredit to fix that.
[07:03:03] <dale> paredit is complaining because it calls indent-sexp.
[07:03:15] <tali713> paredit is the one misbhaving by trating output in repls as code.  it doesn't need to do that.  however, it might be better to implement as a specialized mode or a sub-mode _just_ for repl buffers, since in addition to output there are also previous invalid lines you _may_ have entered.
[07:04:16] <dale> indent-sexp -> lisp-indent-initial-state -> (make-list (1+ (car ppss)) nil) where ppss is result of syntax-ppss and/or parse-partial-sexp.
[07:05:10] <dale> I mean, paredit is just telling Emacs's indent-sexp "indent this", then lisp-mode.el's indent-sexp ends up calling back to Emacs C built-ins to parse the whole buffer, including REPL output.
[07:05:35] <tali713> yes, which it wouldn't do if (paredit-in-comment-p) had triggered.  or _any other test you had there that you wanted_
[07:06:21] <dale> Well, my point is not in a comment or a string, it's on a sexp.
[07:06:44] <tali713> right, and my point is that this is a program that can be changed to ignore output.
[07:06:50] <tali713> with one line.

[07:14:28] <tali713> of course C-M-q should have that behavior, but maybe also paredit should never simply ignore any text at all that has the property (field output)

[07:15:34] <dale> tali713: I don't know, I might like to argue that I should be able to indent an sexp (C-M-q) in my REPL input without Emacs caring about the preceding output. :)

[07:16:59] <dale> Yes, what have they done here.
[07:17:02] <tali713> dale: okay. that is also true.  I think that's a fair criticism.  but on the other hand with unballanced delims it _is_ in the prior expression. except we both know it isn't and that it's easy to detect.  but also I might want to reindent output.
[07:17:45] <dale> It's just not a Friday night if I'm not reading the source for parse-partial-sexp.

[13:08:53] <thblt> You could start a SSH daemon on the target and connect to that.  Not too polite, though.
[13:09:45] <widp> that means I also have to configure the router to accept connections and all of that , right?
[13:10:35] <thblt> Probably.

[15:09:16] <gendl> So I guess an alternative is to use emacs' own input-method for Devanagari. Long term that might be better to learn because presumably that would be portable to windows and linux?

[23:32:49] <wasamasa> uhhh
[23:33:10] <wasamasa> it says that you're supposed to use the function, rather than setting the variable
[23:33:49] <artefact> isn't that equivalent to setting it in the customize ui?
