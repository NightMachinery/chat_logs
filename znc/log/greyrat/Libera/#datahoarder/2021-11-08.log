[02:41:01] <evilgohan2> Cryptobros: "Cryptocurrencies are legitimate money/securities!"
[02:41:05] <evilgohan2> IRS: Ok
[02:41:06] <evilgohan2> ,get https://twitter.com/JTheAccountant/status/1456835909303869447
[02:41:07] <unfinity> James Yochum, CPA (@JTheAccountant) 06| 1d 19h ago 06| H.R.3684 Infrastructure bill passed. Digital Assets are now covered securities. Reporting will be ushered in for all crypto brokers to report to IRS data on activity from 1/1-12/31/23 of all crypto transfers to other non US brokers (private wallets/offshore) #XRP #SEC #Ripple https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FDe26YdXEAAN5F-.jpg
[02:41:15] <evilgohan2> Crpytobros: "Wait, not like that!"
[02:43:02] <NeoThermic> "Reading closer they have added “Digital Assets” into 6050i which means that any individual who receives $10,000 or more in crypto MUST report it to the IRS."
[02:43:14] <NeoThermic> that's either in one go or in multiple transactions in one fiscal year :D
[02:44:06] <joepie91> there goes the money laundering front
[02:44:12] <NeoThermic> you have 15 days to file the 8300, and violating the 6050i is a felony :D
[02:44:26] <evilgohan2> It's a reporting requirement. It also means that anyone who tries to skirt it by instead doing multiple transactions of less than that amount is committing a felony because that's already covered under "Structuring"
[02:44:50] <NeoThermic> hahahah, welcome to the legitimate currency rules :D
[02:45:05] <evilgohan2> "YOU CAN TREAT CRPYTO LIKE MONEY"
[02:45:08] <evilgohan2> IRS: "ok."
[02:45:12] <joepie91> "wait not like that"
[02:45:28] <Hydragyrum> why not just hold all your crypto offshore and anonymously anyway?
[02:45:41] <evilgohan2> That has to be reported too.,
[02:45:53] <evilgohan2> Also, that is damn near the definition of money laundering
[02:46:02] <NeoThermic> don't forget, the IRS doesn't care _how_ you get the money, you just have to report and pay tax on it
[02:46:11] <evilgohan2> Yep
[02:46:44] <evilgohan2> You made $10,000,000 selling crack on the streets? The IRS literally doesn't care. Just file your taxes.
[02:47:02] <NeoThermic> but also
[02:47:16] <NeoThermic> IRS: "You need to pay this fine!" 
[02:47:19] <evilgohan2> you might not wanna say on your taxes *how* you made $10,000,000... and you'll probably not want to itemize deductions or claim business expenses
[02:47:32] <NeoThermic> NTFer: "Will this meme be sufficient?"
[02:47:35] <evilgohan2> but so long as you do pay, the IRS literally does not care.
[02:48:18] <evilgohan2> I just had a thought: if I'm not mistaken, this also subjects any such transfers to capital gains.
[02:48:24] <evilgohan2> Interesting...
[02:51:36] <NeoThermic> I'm also enjoying the comments that suggest that a change in gov would get rid of this law :D

[19:05:48] <ThePendulum> welp that stirred up some controversy in the comments https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/qp2plf/mom_says_southwest_airlines_thought_she_was/
[19:08:12] <ThePendulum> my sister is adopted and I'd find it pretty understandable if someone would quickly check my dad's identity if he was traveling alone with her when she was younger
[19:11:41] <ThePendulum> of course it's not ideal that you stand out if the child has a different race or surname than the parent, but... well, nothing about child exploitation is ideal
[19:12:20] <ThePendulum> maybe it's because we work closely with NCMEC at my job that I am more aware of how much of a problem trafficking really is
[19:15:08] <NiLon> not sure what the news is here, they saw something suspicious and acted on it, like they should
[19:15:45] <ThePendulum> the outrage is that part of the consideration was that the mother seemed to be a different race from the child
[19:16:58] <ThePendulum> they were also crying and switching seats to stay together, so then the outrage became "oh so now a mom with a child of a different race should remember not to cry on an airplane?!"
[19:17:14] <x10> i don't see outrage, i see attention seeking
[19:17:54] <x10> is it annoying that it happend, yes. end of story
[19:19:08] <NiLon> kidnapping and human trafficking are very real things too
[19:19:38] <ThePendulum> a lot of people seem to think that is made up almost entirely just so flight attendants can be racists

[19:19:45] <unfinity> Well this is awkward, the duck needs to think about it. You can try again in 7 seconds.

[19:23:36] <Hawker> Sometimes common sense isn't so common
[19:25:22] <ThePendulum> there's no winning this really, people expect police not to 'harrass' people before they've committed a crime, while preventing crime before it's too late. you're going to have some collateral, as long as a misunderstanding is handled humanely and professionally that is understandable imo
[19:25:52] <Hawker> 100%
[19:27:17] <ThePendulum> they've definitely taken it too far one way or the other, something like this only distracts from that

[22:14:48] <twomanytacos> @Hawker do you know him or you just happen to know he has a couple
[22:27:25] <evilgohan2> I do not miss dealin with the bs that is trying to get into and maintain accounts across private trackers. 
[22:29:30] <twomanytacos> evilgohan2: why? i'm curious 
[22:30:09] <evilgohan2> because it bred elitism, and a sense of unwarranted meritocracy.

[22:31:10] <evilgohan2> Invites that could only be obtained by "knowing" someone
[22:31:32] <evilgohan2> Invites that could only be obtained if you had a certain amount of upload and/or ratio on another "reputable" or "popular" torrent site
[22:31:55] <twomanytacos> sounds stressful already
[22:31:58] <evilgohan2> Invites that literally had to be paid for (SceneTorrents)
[22:32:29] <evilgohan2> Sites with shady owners that constantly begged for money, and then it turns out that the owner takes all the moeny and buys a brand new Lexus IS300

[22:33:22] <twomanytacos> so what do you do now instead of private trackers
[22:33:26] <evilgohan2> Sites that were "invite only", but you could literally pay $20 to dget in.
[22:33:59] <evilgohan2> There was a cool bit of competition at one point with racers grabbing stuff from topsites and trying to get torrents up for it as fast as possible
[22:34:08] <evilgohan2> But then it just degenerated into elitist crap.
[22:34:40] <evilgohan2> "Donors" getting the privilege be an absolute asshat to anyone in irc with no ban because siteops wanted their donations.
