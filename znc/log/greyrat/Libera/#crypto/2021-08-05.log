[05:16:54] <onelegend> let's say that most people are using IPv6 and IPsec for encrypting the layer 3 traffic. Would TLS be obsolete in that case?
[05:17:40] <sarnold> probably not; ipsec between two random parties never really went anywhere
[05:17:54] <onelegend> ah
[05:18:04] <sarnold> you're unlikely to have ipsec rules set up for every bank that you'd want to use, etc etc
[05:18:49] <sarnold> I think the "best" that the opportunistic ipsec use that folks were hoping for twenty years ago would be akin to ssh's trust-on-first-use, or maybe even weaker than that
[05:19:10] <sarnold> though maybe combined with dnssec ..
[05:19:43] <danieldg> you'd still end up setting up trust on a per-ip basis
[05:19:51] <onelegend> ugh
[05:20:02] <sarnold> anyway, that just gets you encryption and authentication between your network and their network; tls gets you encryption and authentication between your browser and their application front end, or email client and server, or email server to email server, etc etc
[05:22:29] <danieldg> the UI for failures in ipsec is also much trickier - the browser can't show cert mismatches as easily since it didn't do that step
[05:22:56] <sarnold> good point
[05:26:20] <danieldg> if you actually have your client allocate one IP per application (browser instance, server, etc) then some of the issues are less important

[05:27:53] <danieldg> an OS-level API saying "give me an IP and report ipsec errors relating to that IP on the returned socket"
[05:28:01] <sarnold> yeah I think you're right. it'd be different [tm] but that's just it, I think only different, not horribly intractable etc
[05:28:37] <sarnold> it might even be less awkward than using openssl apis etc to find out what failed in tls handshaking :)

[05:32:37] <danieldg> even with authenticated dns you could have foo.evil.com point to your.bank.ip and helpfully provide a dnssec-signed pubkey for that ip
[05:33:10] <danieldg> (with this happening on evil.com's free wifi service)
[06:06:00] <onelegend> free bandwidth for me!
[06:06:27] <onelegend> I use sketchy wifi all the time, since it's not like they can read my messages anyways
[06:06:36] <sarnold> you can thank tls for that :)

[16:23:25] <ldm> Are there any (presumably cryptographic) services that allow you to assert "I had this information at or before this time" (that DON'T use the blockchain >:[) ?
[16:23:50] <MacGyver> Post a hash on twitter.
[16:24:06] <ldm> Hmm that was one I was thinking about
[16:24:36] <ldm> The "photograph with todays newspaper" and related tricks gets you "This information was true on or after this time" (good for warrant canaries)

[16:26:19] <ms7821> twitter, github, keybase, anything people will trust
[16:27:10] <ldm> MacGyver: ah thank you!
[16:27:56] <ldm> GitHub is also promising, although if you author a commit (fraudulently) to be dated in the past, you can push that and it will display as that time I think
[16:28:59] <ms7821> not if it's signed
[16:29:30] <ldm> Oh hrm
[16:29:42] <ms7821> oh actually thinking about it maybe that's not right

[16:33:19] <ldm> The hypothetical situation is claiming ownership of an (artistic) photograph; a hash of a low-resolution copy of it and a description of the text, posted on a date before it is published, would allow the photographer to prove they were the original artist
[16:34:05] <ldm> while it's good in theory, I think the main problem would be getting anyone to care xD

[16:45:34] <MacGyver> It's a hash.
[16:45:40] <MacGyver> Hash the damn original.
[16:45:54] <MacGyver> Otherwise your commitment scheme is broken from the get-go.
[16:46:00] <ericonr> maybe because sharing the low resolution one integrally is easier?
[16:46:14] <MacGyver> Then hash both, but hash the original.
[16:46:17] <ericonr> as in hosting websites won't touch it up
[16:46:18] <ericonr> yeah, fair
[16:46:25] <edk> also the low resolution one may (if it's low enough) survive slight modifications
[16:47:11] <edk> which is a good thing if you're trying to make an assertion about the thing the photograph is of, rather than the specific bits of that photo itself

[18:48:25] <onelegend> signatures usually contain a nonce no?
[18:50:36] <woggle> onelegend: Not all signature schemes require one.
[18:52:34] <gggp> private key signature is just hash from that key ?
[18:55:09] <woggle> onelegend: To be more concrete, EdDSA is an example which does not require one and is commonly used for SSH.
[18:56:20] <Hash> gggp: don't repeat the same thing in multiple channels please.
[18:58:13] <gggp> Hash, I read the book :cryptography for developers
[19:03:47] <woggle> onelegend: Er, I guess PKCS1 v1.5 RSA signatures also don't have nonces and are likely more common, not that (if you have a choice) you should use them over RSA-PSS (which does have something that's basically a nonce)
