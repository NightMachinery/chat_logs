[09:11:01] <labrador> neovoid, this chat wont solve your problems..#linux is the place for that. they have people who hve been sysadmins for 30+ years
[09:11:02] <neovoid> I normally dont join any chatroom unless I really need to discuss anything related that chat topic. 
[09:12:53] <neovoid> nice to know. I admit we arent professionals at solving problems but still people do their best here too to help others. and besides solving stuff we use this group for share and get together kind of thing.

[15:42:18] <Aryan[m]1> I wanted a fast text editor with inbuilt terminal. I could find nothing at all. Geany was one but it was just a poor version of sublime text.

[16:17:16] <labrador> Just use vim
[16:17:24] <labrador> It can become an ide if you want

[22:48:48] <iamak[m]> Is there a file system which works good for both Windows and Linux?
[22:49:28] <iamak[m]> I wanted to install some games (in Linux) on ntfs partition but it's a bad idea. And Windows doesn't recognize ext4 so is there a good fs which works for both?
[22:50:53] <Lolsomeone[m]> Idk but why don't you try virtual box or qeum
[22:51:19] <Lolsomeone[m]> Wine goes fine i guess
[22:53:40] <telegram_1385150> <iamak[m]> "Is there a file system which..." <- well *nix supports almost all file systems.. winhoe supports selected ones.. thus choose the one’s winhoe supports( the basic logical intersection ), can use NTFS, FAT32
[22:53:44] <telegram_1385150> * NTFS, FAT32 etc
[22:53:55] <mxbl> ntfs doesn't work well with proton though
[22:54:17] <telegram_1385150> mxbl: proton?
[22:54:31] <mxbl> steam proton
[22:55:23] <iamak[m]> mxbl: Yes which is why I wanted a non ntfs common fs
[22:55:36] <iamak[m]> Is FAT32 good?
[22:55:48] <mxbl> fat32 only supports files up to 2 gigabytes afaik
[22:56:08] <telegram_1385150> iamak[m]: not exactly
[22:56:09] <telegram_1385150> mxbl: this
[22:56:31] <iamak[m]> Yeah that's what I had heard
[22:56:36] <Tor[m]> No it's 4 gb
[22:56:42] <telegram_1385150> iamak[m]: HPFS I heard
[22:56:49] <telegram_1385150> Tor[m]: hmm 4 it is..
[22:57:01] <iamak[m]> I guess I have to format the whole partition, make sub partitions which are different fs
[22:57:04] <mxbl> iamak[m]: you can try exfat and see if it works with proton, it has fragmentation issues though
[22:57:13] <telegram_1385150> we use pendrives generally in fat32 and the size of individual file can’t excedd 4 gigs
[22:57:40] <telegram_1385150> telegram_1385150: forget it
[22:58:46] <telegram_1385150> mxbl: exFAT 16 gigs file size limit
[22:59:04] <telegram_1385150> i don’t game.. but i think heavy games will easy surpass that
[22:59:06] <telegram_1385150> * exFAT has 16 gigs
[22:59:37] <mxbl> yeah but the entire game is probably split into more than one file
[23:00:54] <iamak[m]> mxbl: Okay
