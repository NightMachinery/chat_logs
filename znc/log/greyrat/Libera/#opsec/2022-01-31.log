[03:38:25] <Joanna> Hi everyone
[03:39:38] <Joanna> I’ve gotten to the point where I really distrust updates especially the ones that can’t be undone.
[03:40:33] <Joanna> It seems there is a trend towards end users having less and less control over their devices.

[04:40:33] *** Joins: Malvolio (~Malvolio@user/malvolio)
[04:43:31] <jan6> of course there's that trend, because then 1) more uniformity, therefore less maintenance and 2) less possibility for users to do something the support team or lawyers will have trouble with
[04:45:32] *** Joins: telboon (~telboon@user/telboon)
[04:48:08] <jan6> e.g. if you run a custom rom on your phone, and then run the cellular radio out of spec for your area, then even if the company is totally clear that you're running it at your own risk, they'd probably still have to have a representative spend the time to explain that, and deal with it, or if you have an old unpatched phone, and it gets hacked, and you happen to be at a significant enough position,
[04:48:08] <jan6> they wouldn't want news of "X Thing got hacked, through an insecure MoPhone smartphone!" which, even if they clearly state that the device was not updated to latest patches, people would still instinctively rank the security lower than the brands they've not heard such news about
[04:49:39] <jan6> obviously less variance there is, the easier it is to maintain telemetry and spyware infrastructure also, just as it's easier to maintain all other systems, since obviously all that jazz works both ways
[04:49:54] <jan6> imbalanced weights, but still both ways
[04:50:16] <jan6> and the more you lock down the device, the less possibility of a developer doing anything bad (but also anything cool)
[04:50:37] <jan6> also the video I linked is great
[04:52:21] <joe7057> @Joanna for a computer if you are really concerned about being able to revert updates, maybe use a VM for whatever can run in that so you can just use snapshots to revert updates.
[04:54:28] <jan6> add removable batteries to everything! coincidentally I also recently watched a video about a Ryobi soldering station, that accepts Ryobi batteries, or mains, but video was about how pelicular its design was, like some parts were REALLY solid and good, but others were weirdly cut corners, stuff like really solid unbreakable case, but then the handheld piece had a hard-attached wire, which is one of
[04:54:29] <jan6> the more fragile parts, and both the mains, and the solderer's wires weren't proper heat resistance, etc etc...
[04:55:35] <jan6> joe7057: Qubes ;P (assuming you can run it, on one computer I had some one issue, maybe it was just unsupported, on a newer one, lacked networking, etc, lol), but also, pretty sure was talking about phones
[04:59:07] <joe7057> jan6: thats true, but I was referring to a more general computing experience, just using the VM as an easy way to snapshot the OS
[04:59:21] <jan6> sure, that too
[04:59:42] <Joanna> jan6: thanks for the tip on Kaiba
[05:00:18] <jan6> kaiba is a cool anime, but that specific video also talks about a lot more "real" stuff, else I wouldn't have linked it
[05:02:09] <Joanna> Yea there is a reals world agenda to control memories and bodies
[05:06:57] *** Quits: telboon (~telboon@user/telboon) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[05:10:47] <jan6> nah
[05:10:54] <jan6> it's not direct
[05:11:59] <jan6> it's an illustration that even if you COULD swap bodies, and live forever swapping, or swap into your dream body, that wouldn't help at all, everything would still be just as bad, if not worse
[05:12:21] <jan6> it's intentionally a totally different world
[05:14:18] <Joanna> Of course
[05:15:12] <Joanna> I think they are working on ways to retrieve memories from people’s minds without their permission
[05:15:31] <jan6> of course not
[05:15:37] <jan6> you'll give permission
[05:15:48] <jan6> just not necessarily on a fair basis
[05:16:03] <jan6> e.g. tom scott's welcome to the future or whatever it was
[05:16:46] <Joanna> Even if you could get all of someone’s memories there is more to someone than their memories and physical body. Some call it their soul
[05:17:10] <jan6> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFe9wiDfb0E
[05:17:43] <Joanna> Is there really any such thing as permission if free will doesn’t exist?
[05:18:19] <jan6> "you have died, we scanned your brain, now, stay dead, or pay off the incredibly high fee...can't pay? no problem, we have a free tier, we'll just scan your mind to put perfect ads everywhere, and you might have lag spikes in reality" etc
[05:18:43] <jan6> also "stay dead, or accept terms of service" before that
[05:19:32] <jan6> you will have a choice, just there's gonna be *VERY* few people who'd prefer death over invasive, but free, "extra life"
[05:19:45] <jan6> well, very, compared to the whole
[05:20:58] <Joanna> Lol where do you find those things:)
[05:22:03] <jan6> I've just been around for a long enough time on the internets ;P
[05:22:26] <jan6> most of the fun stuff is either old, oldish, or from the creators of the old
[05:22:32] <Joanna> That thing about Kaiba not being popular because the story is too complicated says it all.
[05:22:54] <jan6> people watch stuff for entertainment, not complex story, most of the time
[05:23:17] <Joanna> I’ve noticed that most media is rather unoriginal
[05:23:41] <jan6> story comes second to all the other "fun stuff", who cares if a scene has been reused 50 times, it's "fun"
[05:23:50] <jan6> most of LIFE is unoriginal, y'know
[05:23:50] <Joanna> Why would anyone find something boring entertaining?
[05:23:53] <jan6> so no surprise ;P
[05:24:22] <jan6> the whole of the things, isn't too unoriginal, even if it could be abstracted to very similar points
[05:24:32] <Joanna> I try to explore something new as often as I can
[05:25:05] <Joanna> Yesterday I found some amazing artwork under a bridge
[05:25:07] <jan6> like, almost all houses are just unoriginal rectangular shapes, with either flat, or ~45 degree roofs
[05:25:26] <jan6> almost all cars are about the same shape, with small style differences
[05:25:50] <jan6> almost all clothes are the same basic shape, with minor proportion and material modifications
[05:25:53] <jan6> etc etc
[05:25:58] <jan6> that doesn't mean they're all the same
[05:26:56] <jan6> all gloves are the same shape, and majority are very similar, but there's still good gloves and bad ones, comfortable ones, and warm, but still uncomfortable ones, etc
[05:27:07] <jan6> (well, same 2 shapes, but still)
[05:27:37] <jan6> following the same story points, can be different enough to not be boring
[05:28:07] <jan6> having the same scenes, can be set up in a way it's still good enough to watch
[05:28:16] <Joanna> Artwork seems to be deliberately short on supply and discouraged. When was the last time someone could make a living painting murals in homes and public places. It seems like making most places as boring as possible and mobile phones work hand in hand to control the zombies.
[05:28:32] <jan6> artwork is more plentiful than EVER before
[05:28:47] <jan6> even getting paid for it, is, overall
[05:28:48] <Joanna> Not in homes
[05:28:56] <jan6> but the prevalence, is not
[05:29:15] <Joanna> Where is it ? I don’t see much most places I go.
[05:29:47] <jan6> there's more people, but less publically shown art, and even at homes, it's more convenient to get a poster, than to commission or make an original piece, both of which also more expensive
[05:30:02] <jan6> digital art is all over the web, including commission art
[05:30:04] <Joanna> Your country has pretty old buildings
[05:30:23] <jan6> sure, all countries have 'em, somewhere
[05:30:55] <Joanna> Who cares about art that can’t be found! I want to see art without having to search
[05:30:55] <jan6> just over here, there wasn't a hurry to tear them all immediately down
[05:31:10] <jan6> art can be FOUND
[05:31:20] <jan6> and you have to look at the right places
[05:31:53] <jan6> you're not gonna see a painting, unless you look at a gallery, be it personal or public
[05:32:06] <Joanna> I shouldn’t have to search to find art! That is my point. Having to search means it’s scarce.
[05:33:02] <Joanna> Why must paintings be limited to galleries?? Paintings can be on any ceiling or wall.
[05:33:19] <jan6> you have to search to find a book, you have to search to find non-fast-food, you have to search to find a f*in 3-wheeled bicycle (the sort with 3 equally big wheels), what's your point
[05:33:28] <jan6> paintings must be TAKEN CARE OF
[05:33:44] <jan6> which most people don't care to do, so they prefer to have nothing at all, instead
[05:34:03] <Joanna> Most people are drones.
[05:34:17] <jan6> you can't just carelessy swipe a cloth over a dusty painting
[05:35:02] <Joanna> A mural on a wall is not difficult to maintain but it takes skill to create
[05:35:17] <jan6> and money
[05:35:37] <jan6> and arrangements, that people are fine with it
[05:36:10] <jan6> heck, nowdays you could argue that most people don't even clean their own rooms anymore, either, they get either a robot vacuum, or cleaning service, especially at non-personal spaces
[05:36:51] <jan6> also, you just have to look for "culture spots" and "art spots" if you want to see art in the wild, generally
[05:36:51] <Joanna> There is money created out of thin air and used for bad things but no money for murals in public places and homes?
[05:37:12] <jan6> because for some reason, a lot of people *LIkE* the plain and orderly plain-ness
[05:37:28] <Joanna> Most people have homes that are too large and filled with junk
[05:37:31] <jan6> the point is that art isn't seen as having a "purpose"
[05:38:18] <Joanna> This is a cultural thing.
[05:38:19] <jan6> you pay money to have a mural, but why not avoid "wasting" the money, and instead get a new car?
[05:38:31] <jan6> art is a cultural thing
[05:38:49] <jan6> it's ALWAYS been in the minority, and out of view for the most part
[05:39:30] <jan6> other than a sculpture in this garden and that, you've never really had a time when art was "just there", publically, because "hey, looks cool"
[05:40:06] <jan6> the more back in time, the harder it was to even see art, unless you were already rich
[05:40:12] <Joanna> They don’t want public art for the same reason they don’t want nude beaches. They want to control the supply of everything. Have you ever heard the stories of how the Dutch made sure most people couldn’t afford to eat nutmeg ?
[05:40:24] <jan6> no to all of them
[05:41:10] <jan6> and they don't want nude beaches because of cultural stigmas and stuff
[05:41:23] <jan6> [insert terry prachett "little lies" quote]
[05:42:01] <Joanna> They don’t want non sexual nudity they want perverts supporting their misogynistic garbage on internet.
[05:42:18] <jan6> your "they" varies with every sentence
[05:44:09] <Joanna> They means third parties obviously
[05:44:53] * jan6 disagrees with most, but not all of Joanna's conspiracy theories, and overbroad control contrivations
[05:44:58] * jan6 off
[05:46:05] <Joanna> There used to be nude beaches that families could go to and the news media made sure that came to an end so that financial interests in the smut industry wouldn’t lose revenue.
[05:46:43] <jan6> (this is what I'm talking about)
[05:47:16] <Joanna> Just because I don’t list everyone who doesn’t everything bad by their legal name doesn’t prove that nobody ever does anything bad.
[05:48:19] <jan6> you just LOVE overbroad statements that are factually incorect
[05:48:22] <jan6> *rr
[05:48:41] <Joanna> It doesn’t even matter what the names of people who do bad things are . The only thing that matters is that it’s allowed and will continue to be allowed.
[05:49:14] <jan6> e.g. https://www.attractionsofamerica.com/thingstodo/10-best-nude-beaches-in-the-usa.php and https://www.worldbeachguide.com/usa/nude-beaches.htm
[05:49:31] <Joanna> How do you know what is correct? Was your swimsuit optional beach shut down ?
[05:49:46] <jan6> I've obviously not checked all the ones, but for example, https://www.hauloverbeach.org/ loud and clear exclaims front page how they have a clothing optional strech
[05:50:32] <jan6> "The organization South Florida Free Beaches worked hard to get this beach established by the city of Miami as an official clothing-optional beach. Their Ambassadors work hard to make sure that they’re available as a resource for visitors to the beach. Please say hello to them when you see them, and thank them for volunteering."
[05:51:05] <Joanna> It’s funny how idiots believe they have rights yet it’s illegal to lie on a beach and get a proper suntan...
[05:51:06] <jan6> "People ask, “can I bring my kids to Haulover Beach?” The answer is unequivocally, YES! This is a public beach. There’s nothing “adult” about enjoying the beach without the restriction of clothing. We think that people ask this question because they think that this is an adults-only activity.
[05:51:07] <jan6> Absolutely not. Being nude on the beach is an activity for EVERYONE, regardless of their age."
[05:51:23] <jan6> it's not illegal, if you go to the right beach
[05:52:34] <Joanna> And art still exists if you go to the right museum and pay a hefty fee and go along with their pandemic rituals...
[05:52:57] <jan6> or go to one that doesn't have a hefty fee ;P
[05:53:41] <jan6> hefty fees are usually at the big mainstream ones, but they're not the only ones, just like not all shops are necessarily in a shopping mall
[05:54:15] <Joanna> I bet that parents don’t let their kids go naked anymore thanks to the pedo hysteria pushed by the same news media that canceled nude beaches before.
[05:54:54] <jan6> well, it's not THAT much a hysteria
[05:55:15] <jan6> but it's just more the reason to keep an eye on your kid ;P
[05:56:01] <jan6> the safest place to be, is to have them stay in their room, with parental controls on their devices, and you constantly monitoring all they do, and at that point, you're just being stupid
[05:56:23] <Joanna> It was probably the new media that summoned all the weirdos with binoculars on cliffs above the nude beach. I like the story I heard about French nude bathers beating up men that come to their beach clothed to stare at women..
[05:56:45] * jan6 slep tho, as promised
[05:57:27] <Joanna> Parents try to protect their kids in the wrong ways for sure.

[11:46:32] <Joanna> jan6: by the way blacks beach is not a real nude beach since the 1970s. I’ve been there. It is remote and no longer has a lifeguard .the remoteness allows men to walk around there nude without getting busted. That isn’t my idea of a safe place to go to the beach with or without clothes.
