[01:22:31] <nickgaw> One thing I don't get is why can the kernel sources not do a custom kernel configuration file based on your currently loaded modules and already detected hardware so you could easily build a custom kernel optimized for your system?

[01:25:39] <greycat> The way you're using the word "optimized" is closer to "using minimal disk space".  It won't run any faster, most likely.  It just has fewer unused modules sitting around.  But the cost of this is that if your hardware changes (e.g. you add a new card), you may not have the module for it.

[01:29:42] <greycat> Back in the old days when your CPU had a unique model number like "80486", compiling the kernel for your specific CPU could conceivably make a noticeable difference, vs. the bog standard 80386 build.

[01:31:08] <nickgaw> true I was just thinking that building for just what this laptop has in it would make it faster but from what you are saying no.

[01:55:23] <Khepra> but if you insist on using literally the debian's qcows, I suppose you can dd that over ssh to your disk image, too

[05:47:35] <dpkg> PHP Packages with different versions than stable are available from deb.sury.org, provided by the same developer who maintains PHP for debian stable. Not supported in #debian, but should be about as reliable as <backports>. Short instructions can be found at https://packages.sury.org/php/README.txt . See <mod-php>.

[12:36:13] <Khepra> mags: you're not defining the network interface. I don't recall if qemu does any by default (I don't think so?)
[12:37:30] <Khepra> at any rate, something like   -netdev user,id=mynet0,<other options>    -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=mynet0                  (mynet0 is arbitrary name on the host side, not in the guest)
[12:37:47] <mags> it does `-net user` by default, and I have a connection once I setup networkd, it's just never a connection in the installer
[12:38:20] <Khepra> being explicit about netdev has always worked for me, with the debian installer + dhcp (default)
[12:38:53] <Khepra> another question is, how are you configuring networkd? for dhcp? static?
[12:39:11] <mags> apparently in user networking mode, ping doesn't work, so I was thinking perhaps that's how the installer is checking for a connection

[16:50:59] <semitones> So the reason I am looking in auth.log is to try to find out why I got a kex error last time I restarted sshd. I am finding these in the logs: fatal: Missing privilege separation directory: /run/sshd. Can I find out why I'm getting this? The bug looks like it was already closed: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=864190

[19:29:12] <alkisg> Btw why aren't you using ssh keys for that, instead of abusing its stdin?

[19:37:06] <Khepra> karlpinc: for years I would've recommended you install upstream tarballs and sub to security announcements. but lately, last two releases, they dropped the ball completely, there was no SA, and I learned about it from debian bumping packages all of a sudden

[19:38:51] <Khepra> heller: how did you generate the key?

[19:42:00] <jelly> heller, keeping a plaintext password somewhere is even less safe

[19:42:44] <Khepra> if you DO, then what's the problem? if you DON'T then generate a key without it.

[19:47:06] <heller> im not sure what happened but earlier it worked without the -o option

[19:48:33] <alkisg> jelly: from my notes, when testing it in the past:   # jessie-mate breaks with IdentityFile=/dev/null and shows:

[20:42:40] <karlpinc> somiaj: I like nginx for all sorts of stuff.  The config is much more sane.  The only ungood thing is that it does not have wsgi support.  But it's probably better to run a stand-along wsgi server anyway and reverse proxy.
[20:43:46] <somiaj> karlpinc: yea, I would prefer to use it, I found for static sites and proxies it was much easier to use and faster. But I kept running into things that I needed apache for, so I am stuck with apache
[20:43:53] <karlpinc> somiaj: For some strange reason nginx does have uwsgi support.  But uwsgi is "configure by example", and if you can't find an example that does exactly what you want to do (out of the too-many examples provided) uwsgi is really annoying.

[22:21:12] <greycat> mutt and many other terminal-based mail user agents can be told to contact an IMAP server, if that's what you're using
[22:21:23] <heller> not using anything actually

[22:21:41] <heller> not use a specific mail app
[22:22:07] <Khepra> but cli command == specific mail app
[22:22:22] <Khepra> unless you're talking shell builtins, all "cli commands" are specific (purpose) apps.
[22:22:46] <Khepra> you could also use curl, if you really hate yourself. I guess. maybe.
[22:23:02] <Khepra> right. you can.  https://gist.github.com/akpoff/53ac391037ae2f2d376214eac4a23634
[22:23:41] <kjetilho> for batch scripting, perhaps something like imapsync or fetchmail.
[22:24:01] <kjetilho> I think notmuch also does batch downloading ?

[23:38:05] <jmcnaught> marcmance: if you have the 'nc' command then "apt-config dump | nc termbin.com 9999" will put your apt config into a paste you can give us the URL for
[23:38:16] <Khepra> pipmik: you can dd entire old disk to new disk down at the bit level from sector 0 onward. gpt will complain about missing backup at the end of disk, but that can be fixed with tools like gpt. then you can resize/enlarge the LUKS containers, and filesystem in it
[23:38:26] <greycat> assuming nc can resolve termbin.com and connect to it
[23:38:43] <jmcnaught> I thought it was only apt that couldn't resolve.
[23:39:01] <Khepra> pipmik: just don't destroy the old disk until you're sure everything went okay. one possible problem is with LUKS container, it tends to brick itself up if you mess the new size and make it not aligned to 4k
[23:39:19] <pipmik> Khepra: i understood dd part but i have no idea how to do second part resize and LUKS section
[23:40:48] <Khepra> pipmik: cryptsetup has "resize". actually, first you'll want to exntend/resize the last gpt partition, then assuming that's LUKS container, you resize that. then finally expand the filesystem. iirc you can even expand rootfs online
