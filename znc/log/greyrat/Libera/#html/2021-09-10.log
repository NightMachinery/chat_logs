[21:39:21] <axisys> I added a title="my title" within my <iframe ..></iframe> but it does not show. what am I doing wrong? 
[21:40:57] <DPA> Maybe try top.document.title
[21:44:03] <axisys> DPA: <iframe top.document.title="my title" ... ></iframe> ? (sorry html newbie here)
[21:45:54] <axisys> that did not work.. still not showing title
[21:46:42] <axisys> my iframe is a embedded chart .. wanted to mention that if that made any difference
[21:47:05] <DPA> Oh, no. I thought you may want to change the window title from within an iframe. I didn't know an iframe had a title tag. It's not something the browser would show, though.
[21:50:25] <DPA> I'd just use a <h1>, <h2>, or similar tag to make a visible heading/caption/title.
[21:51:33] <axisys> DPA: here is an example <iframe src="https://chart-embed.service.newrelic.com/charts/5aa7d803-3cc8-412a-aacb-769cc4d046ca"></iframe> .. I want to add a title to this table chart.. let me try <h1>
[21:53:28] <DPA> Since this is a chart, semantically, <figure> and <figcaption>, and maybe a bit of css, may also be a sensible way to do it. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figure
[21:54:48] <DPA> Although, the whole semantic part of the semantic web hasn't really caught on much yet.
[21:59:11] <axisys> DPA: so use <figure> instead of <iframe> ?
[22:03:47] <DPA> No, essentially <figure><figcaption>My Title Text</figcaption><iframe src="https://chart-embed.service.newrelic.com/charts/5aa7d803-3cc8-412a-aacb-769cc4d046ca"></iframe></figure> and maybe some css to go with it <style>figcaption {font-size: 1.5em;}</style>.
[22:03:47] <DPA> But really, it usually doesn't matter much if <h2>, <figcaption>, or a <div> and some css is used in practice. A lot of webpages just put everything in divs, and then style it with classes. Anything goes.
[22:12:12] <axisys> DPA: just <h1>my title</h1><iframe>..</iframe> worked. 
[22:12:58] <axisys> DPA: sorry another newbie question.. css style <style>..<style> inside <iframe>? 
[22:14:07] <axisys> I have seem <div> and may be I will do some research that a little more before implementing it. I am mostly a backend engineer and python coders.. so my questions here how stupid I am in frontend *sigh*
[22:15:26] <DPA> <style>, <link> and <script> stuff should always go inside <head>.
[22:16:26] <DPA> Stuff inside <style> is css. It can make any element look any way you can imagine.
[22:21:11] <axisys> Ah, so if I want a specific <style> to be applied to only a specific <iframes> I need to bundle them into a separate <head>, right?
[22:23:54] <DPA> No, the html document can only have one head. Also, the styles of the documents loaded in an iframe are independent of that of the embedding document.
[22:25:03] <axisys> DPA: sorry how to do I have separate <style> for each <iframe> ? 
[22:26:03] <DPA> There can be many style tags, and a style tag can have many css selectors which can have variouse rules. The selectors are used to specify to which elements the rue
[22:26:10] <DPA> css rules apply.
[22:26:46] <DPA> CSS can also be put in a different file.
[22:27:32] <axisys> is there a example page you can share ? (all on same page, since I am using html macro in confluence page) 
[22:31:03] *** Quits: jetchisel (jetchisel@user/jetchisel) (Quit: Unfortunately time is always against us -- [Morpheus])
[22:32:04] <DPA> Oh, a macro of a templateing engine, that complicates things a little bit. I don't know what the best approach in that specific case is.
[22:34:43] <axisys> so <h1>my title</h1><iframe ..></iframe> is working. I have multiple of those. I like to have add <style> and that would probably all I need for now. Appreciate your help a lot!
[22:38:21] <DPA> Well, you could in theory place a <style> anywhere. It's also possible to use inline style="" attributes. But both approaches aren't all that pretty.
[22:38:21] <DPA> Maybe take a look at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps to get a better idea of how CSS works.
[22:40:43] <DPA> A style tag will always be for the whole page, but has selectors to match elements in it. A style attribute are only CSS rules for the element the attribute is on.

[23:14:39] <nullbytes> Is it possible to have an HTML range slider with an infinitely small "step" or to calculate the optimal step so that sliding the range slider by 1 pixel always gives the most precise value for the slider's current position?
[23:23:25] <axisys> what attribute to use to make the iframe large enough to fit content? I am keep forcing to adjust the height every month for new data to fit into a iframe without scrolling
[23:29:33] <lilmonkey``> axisys, there's no straightforward way, for security reasons. If you control the iframe document you can use the `postMessage` API to communicate between the parent and child document. The child document will have to measure the height and report it to the parent, which can then set the height on the iframe.
[23:30:35] <axisys> lilmonkey``: so there is auto adjust option for height? hmm
[23:35:33] <axisys> width="100%" works for most of my chart since the time axis is x. But for table type chart it grows veritically and like to see all content without scrolling.. may be just live with scroll for now :-)
[23:44:40] <DPA> lilmonkey``: There is the special any value. step="any"
[23:44:40] <DPA> axisys: There is no good way I know of to make an <iframe>, <object>, <embed>, <portal>, or any other tag that can embed a html page, match the size of it's content, with html or css. There may be some ways with JS, though.
[23:45:24] <lilmonkey``> DPA, I think you meant nullbytes :)
[23:45:47] <lilmonkey``> And I just explained how you can do it with JS.
[23:47:13] <DPA> Oh, yea.
