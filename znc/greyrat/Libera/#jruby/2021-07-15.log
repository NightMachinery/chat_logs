[01:56:07] <edipofederle[m]> Question: How do you guys approach new Ruby versions, I mean, right now we are 'aligned' with 2.6 ? (sorry if my question is not clear) 
[02:14:56] <headius> For the past few versions we build a checklist of all features in the NEWS file for that release
[02:15:53] <headius> You can see those issues in our tracker. We just go down the checklist and make sure we have those features implemented. We also use the Ruby specs to make sure we pass and we try to run the unit tests as well
[02:16:31] <headius> So if you wanted some low-hanging easy things to do you could start looking at Ruby 2.7 and 3.0 features and coordinate with enebo to start implementing them. He has been doing some work on 3.0 already
[02:16:51] <headius> I think we have a 2.7 checklist but not a 3.0 checklist
[02:17:23] <headius> Many of the new features are easy to implement and sometimes they are just fine to use pure Ruby
[02:19:58] <edipofederle[m]> great. Clear. I will take a look on it for sure
