[17:39:08] <relejek[m]> i still can't stomach tg though. can't really differentiate tg vs signal in terms of data-safety and privacy
[17:40:33] <relejek[m]> even though un encrpted (idm for pub groups) matrix allows people to keep themselves anonymous.
[17:40:51] <relejek[m]> also xmpp.

[18:06:56] <Hemishhehim[m]> finally decided to be on telegram again, it just works, and has some more features than most matrix clients
[18:08:38] <Hemishhehim[m]> all most all signal clients dont have this one feature: when you open a room, it automatically goes to the last message, whereas telegram goes to unread messages, so that i can scroll and read all, and i can even keep the reading in between and quit the application, it would save the state, and when i would open that group again, it would bring me to same place where i left, i can continue to keep reading messages
