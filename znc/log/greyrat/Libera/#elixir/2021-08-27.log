[14:09:04] <hauleth> Anyone have idea how to test tracer when doing partial recompilation. Is there a way to make `mix compile` compile only single module?
[14:24:33] <josevalim> nox: more info on Partial<T>?
[14:24:56] <nox> josevalim: Same as T but all fields are optional
[14:25:10] <nox> josevalim: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html
[14:25:34] <josevalim> hauleth: maybe look at test/kernel/lexical_tracker_test.exs in elixir, but i think you can call Code.eval_file or similar
[14:27:31] <josevalim> nox: do you mean at the pattern matching level?
[14:27:47] <josevalim> or at the dialyzer level?
[14:28:07] <nox> josevalim: Typing level yes
[14:28:12] <nox> It's a type, heh.
[14:28:29] <josevalim> no, not really. when it comes to dialyzer we are mostly a thin wrapper
[14:28:43] <josevalim> having conveniences like that for structs could be useful though, for sure

[17:02:13] <hauleth> So for example if `Foo.bar/0` is used from `Bar.baz/0` and `Foo` module is recompiled, then it will not report `Foo.bar/0` as unused

[21:37:24] <whk> Is it normal for mount on a live_view to be called twice on page load? I am trying live view for the first time with phoenix 1.6. 
[21:39:40] <whk> nevermind, found this on the forum https://elixirforum.com/t/mount-vs-handle-params-on-the-liveview-life-cycle/31920/2

[23:08:13] <hoppity> What is the best way to check if a  value is nil and if not nil get a property out of it?
[23:08:51] <hoppity> disregard my stupid question haha

[23:22:30] <cess11> pattern matching?
[23:22:49] <benwilson512> || usually
[23:23:02] <benwilson512> or [] depending on what kind of value it is
[23:24:39] <cess11> ah, don't listen to me, i'm a beginner
[23:26:48] <benwilson512> pattern matching is a fine option!

[23:51:17] <cess11> i suspect || is more suited in this case though
[23:52:33] <cess11> i've been dabbling a bit with phoenix and liveview and they're quite nice to work with, so i'd like to build some convenience application against an existing application 
[23:53:07] <cess11> the tricky thing is that it lives, partly, in a few hundred databases in the same cluster 
[23:53:53] <cess11> as far as i've been able to figure things out it isn't exactly trivial to start up a driver and ecto on user input at runtime
[23:54:52] <cess11> these databases share schema, so that can be reused, but it seems credentials and database need to be available when the elixir application starts up
[23:55:13] <benwilson512> cess11: interesting
[23:56:11] <cess11> at best this would be a few user system, so i'm thinking it might be an option to spin up an application (or genserver?) at app startup per database, and lower the default driver pool to something like 2-3 connections
[23:56:30] <benwilson512> https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/replicas-and-dynamic-repositories.html may be of interest too
[23:59:56] <cess11> right, i skimmed that a couple of weeks ago and it didn't seem like a good fit but now looking at it i think i could try to feed the for loop a different database name for each cycle
