[00:06:06] <iDrougge> When I went to university around year 2000, I noted 10base5 cable running in the cellar of our building and into the faculty office.
[00:06:38] <iDrougge> It was already ancient by then, but was apparently used for building interconnect.
[00:16:25] <shapr> I started my career installing 10base5 and 10base2, we were replace ARCNet networks
[00:16:39] <shapr> replacing*
[00:27:28] <varjag> popped terminators like john connor
[00:28:45] <shapr> I have several pounds of 10base2 terminators
[00:28:48] * shapr looks
[00:31:53] <shapr> ok, here's what I could find https://recurse.social/@shapr/107028288369487250
