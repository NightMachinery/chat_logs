[07:58:16] <superkuh> Manually.
[08:01:27] <Hydragyrum> if you always use `mv` for your file-moving needs, you could wrap mv (i.e. shell function, wrapper script) to also fix the m3u entries

[18:26:52] <rdrg109> DataHoarder: That sounds great. The problem with that approach is that I also change the tag of my files and this result in a new hash for that file.
[18:27:23] <DataHoarder> Use internal stream hash :)
[18:27:30] <DataHoarder> otherwise here I never change files
[18:27:38] <DataHoarder> but metadata gets stored in database
[18:27:42] <DataHoarder> and changed or extended there
[18:27:50] <DataHoarder> files are treated as blobs

[19:50:04] <rmmh> you can do the same for video. kind of neat sometimes 
[19:51:49] <rmmh> DataHoarder: an even simpler way is to have hardlinked media files, so you have music/by_sha/abcdef0123.mp3 and your Playlists just point to that 
[19:52:06] <DataHoarder> Three are not local playlists
[19:52:21] <DataHoarder> plus files get reorganized and can appear multiple times
[19:52:37] <rmmh> yes, this is if you're keeping all the files on one disk
[19:52:47] <rmmh> well, one fs
[19:52:50] <DataHoarder> Remember this is a multi user setup without access to raw disk
[19:52:53] <DataHoarder> it is in one fs
[19:52:56] <DataHoarder> one cluster fs
[19:53:08] <DataHoarder> hardlinks would work, but it was pretty meh
[19:53:17] <rmmh> rdrg109 might have a simpler use case
[19:53:25] <DataHoarder> also They MUST not be modified
[19:53:34] <DataHoarder> due to how they need to exist :)
[19:54:08] <DataHoarder> if modified, they get changed back to original form, so all those sections are mounted read only, create empty
[19:54:56] <DataHoarder> This metadata also extends further from what file formats can handle anyhow,  but if it’s your own collection, hard links work to source files
[19:55:08] <DataHoarder> or soft links even across boundaries

[20:04:07] <unfinity> brimstone you befriended a duck in 8.294 seconds! You have made friends with 123 ducks in #datahoarder.
[20:04:45] <rdrg109> ThePendulum: XD
[20:04:52] <rmmh> rdrg109: if you're willing to put small hashes or identifiers in the filenames, you could use them to re-identify the Playlists later for correction 
[20:05:40] <ThePendulum> I'm imagining tons of people listening to that thinking "that's an... unusual sample" 
[20:05:44] <rmmh> otherwise you could have a small database mapping filenames to audio fingerprints, and then scan your playlists for missing files and rewrite them using the known fingerprints 
[20:06:18] <rmmh> letting the fingerprint database include entries for missing files too, and just scanning new files
[20:06:54] <rmmh> possibly extend fp db to replace mappings if a file length changes, to permit replacements 
[20:07:57] <rmmh> I'm imagining a sqlite3 db with columns (path, size, hash), and a utility that scans your media files and adds new entries for new (path, size) tuples, and that fixes up playlists using the previous fingerprints 
[20:08:31] <rmmh> (this is DataHoarder's suggestion, slightly adapted) 
[20:08:58] <DataHoarder> object store?
[20:09:01] <DataHoarder> do ceph 
[20:09:22] <DataHoarder> And yes I have that match against torrent files to tag groups :)
[20:10:00] <DataHoarder> audio exact hash is pretty nice indeed, as in, decoded into PCM
[20:10:25] <DataHoarder> removing start null and end frames also good, while noting how many there were, then hashing
[20:10:45] <DataHoarder> excellent for FLAC and finding same song across many different re-releases
[20:11:22] <DataHoarder> you can also go further and doing loose fingerprinting and matching, and voila, you have a nice db
[20:11:36] <rmmh> whether full audio fingerprinting like that is necessary is kind of depedendent on whether you do any tagging ops
[20:11:43] <DataHoarder> Easier to decide whether to trust broken file metadata at scale
[20:12:18] <rmmh> DataHoarder: I wish there was a torrent client that had a "missing files? check the local directory for files with the right sizes and hash them, just in case" 
[20:12:25] <DataHoarder> yeah when you pull a few albums a minute forever, you keep getting same song just compressed with different flac level or encoder, but PCM decoded would be the same
[20:12:36] <rmmh> option, so I didn't need to use terrible gui rename functionality 
[20:12:38] <DataHoarder> it exists
[20:12:41] <DataHoarder> autotorrent
[20:13:03] <DataHoarder> maybe patch it a bit for Unicode support, and it works well across many clients
[20:13:13] <DataHoarder> feed it files and match method, it builds db
[20:13:18] <DataHoarder> then you feed it torrent files
[20:13:21] <rmmh> neat, that's close, but I mean for running torrents 
[20:13:23] <DataHoarder> and matches against all that
[20:13:37] <rmmh> I've downloaded a torrent and want to fix atrocious organization 
[20:13:43] <DataHoarder> well you can remove and auto torrent will add it again :)
[20:13:49] <rmmh> fair enough 
[20:13:59] <rmmh> client could also scan for inodes
[20:14:15] <DataHoarder> Tbh that assumes you are on the same fs 
[20:14:19] <rmmh> tracking inodes is possibly the simplest way to follow renamed files
[20:14:24] <DataHoarder> this works across whatever method
[20:14:38] <DataHoarder> Even on silly sftp mounts
[20:14:47] <rmmh> last time I looked Ceph didn't permit the exotic protection setups that I wanted 
[20:15:00] <DataHoarder> Ceph is just a tool with many knobs :)
[20:15:11] <DataHoarder> there is rgw if you want S3 like api
[20:15:20] <DataHoarder> librados for raw
[20:15:26] <DataHoarder> rbd for block storage
[20:15:46] <DataHoarder> cephfs for a distributed filesystem on top of rados/object storage

[20:18:36] <DataHoarder> I run a small 500TiB and 28TiB NVMe cluster with it now
[20:18:39] <DataHoarder> just four nodes
[20:18:59] <DataHoarder> And I have thrown all kinds of weird configuration and hardware at it
[20:19:16] <rmmh> does it handle smr ok
[20:19:38] <rmmh> >small 500TiB 
[20:19:40] <DataHoarder> It works, wouldn’t recommend. Haven’t looked back from when I had smr 
[20:19:40] <rmmh> :) 
[20:20:01] <DataHoarder> you need to put journal outside or map it well via physical LVM 
[20:20:32] <DataHoarder> There was a task to make it better, but did not check if they finished
[20:20:51] <DataHoarder> if it’s mostly read or write once/read many it does fine 
[20:21:01] <rmmh> https://pad.ceph.com/p/smr active dev work
[20:21:28] <DataHoarder> Had a tiered system where all writes went to NVMe pool on top, when cold they got backed into SMR 
[20:21:55] <DataHoarder> Oh, that is good to know, active work on SMR
[20:22:32] <DataHoarder> This is for host managed drives right?
[20:22:38] <DataHoarder> not drive managed ones
[20:24:40] <rmmh> I think so? I don't think drive managed smr even has the concept of conventional zones
[20:24:57] <rmmh> And large operators sponsoring dev work like this don't give a shit about drive managed smr
[20:25:48] <rmmh> realistically none of my IO patterns are affected by smr, I'm just one person doing bulk media storage
[20:34:07] <DataHoarder> Drive managed SMR still has the zones, you never get to see them :(
[20:34:30] <DataHoarder> yeah if it’s not random write heavy it’s fine
[20:34:54] <DataHoarder> only issue I had with the SMR drives is you could not put an OP timeout
[20:35:11] <DataHoarder> as in, the seterc or whatever command 
[20:35:17] <DataHoarder> so it sometimes stalled forever
[20:35:36] <DataHoarder> Get one with this, and I think it will work better than for me

[21:19:09] <rmmh> if you're just protecting against tagging modifications, you can do better by hashing the bitstreams
[21:19:14] <rmmh> Without decoding 
[21:19:31] <evilgohan2> This is a different circumstance
[21:19:32] <evilgohan2> That's from a script I use to automate pulling down music audio / music videos from a DJ service.
