[00:48:39] <guideX> bomb, recently, when I went for clavicle surgery, they charged me $50,000.00 for two metal plates, some metal screws, and wire
[00:48:59] <guideX> that's not including the cost of the doctor himself, and hospital fees and stuff
[00:49:04] <guideX> just the pile of metal
[00:49:49] <guideX> probably the actual cost of that stuff is less than $1.00

[03:34:52] <brianonymous> i did. i owe you some top shelf alcohol
[03:35:01] <gufi> >=D
[03:35:25] <gufi> i had 3 people interested in jobs but WO was too slow at hiring them
[03:35:26] <brianonymous> emailz me address.

[03:35:56] <gufi> your work... email... no longer works?? lol

[03:36:58] <gufi> ... is this why wheni tried looking your ass up last week i couldnt find you!??
[03:37:14] <brianonymous> yes
[03:37:19] <brianonymous> if it was after wednesday
[03:37:49] <gufi> wait... morris... that name sounds super familar..

[03:38:23] <brianonymous> i forgot his WO title.. VP of streaming?
[03:39:54] <gufi> something like that yea
[03:40:54] <gufi> he was mentioned as retiring i thought in some recent meeting
[03:41:35] <brianonymous> weird.. we are the same age
[03:41:43] <brianonymous> unless that was just the excuse
[03:41:47] <gufi> could be
[03:42:40] <Suchiman> brianonymous: you quit?
[03:42:49] <gufi> he was bought
[03:43:12] <brianonymous> ^ was bought
[03:43:18] <Suchiman> bought? xD
[03:43:23] <brianonymous> again \o/
[03:43:36] <Suchiman> brianonymous: some other company made an offer you couldn't refuse?

[03:44:29] <Suchiman> brianonymous: ah, yeah, saw that, but you said termination agreement which sounded like you quit
[03:44:41] <gufi> what are the details of this cause that seems ... like a huge chunk of what the company does
[03:45:02] <brianonymous> oh, no.. just that we voluntarily terminate our employeement and the terms of such
[03:45:30] <brianonymous> goof: well, we were always kinda the bastard child. at least thats how i saw it. WO is more TV/video
[03:45:45] <Suchiman> brianonymous: so you're being fired? or is this just a formal thing as part of the takeover?
[03:45:48] <brianonymous> and then they wanted to diversify, but i dont think they could ever figure out what to do next
[03:46:10] <brianonymous> Suchiman: just a formality ... i then had to get hired an hour later
[03:46:24] <Suchiman> ah, gotcha
[03:46:29] <MizMahem> big payday?
[03:47:07] <gufi> i wonder how much of this happening now is what caused the shift right after i got hired
[03:47:12] <MizMahem> Suchiman: hey, I wanted to thank you again for before. Such a little thing really blew open my mind, can't believe I didn't know about it before.
[03:47:19] <brianonymous> i cant talk details bout nothing - now a public traded company. i am very happy.

[07:53:48] <teegee10> does the DI framework create an object of a class straight away when it's being configured (as a singleton) or later when we can GetService()?
[07:53:56] *** teegee10 is now known as teegee
[07:54:21] <gufi> would be entirely dependent on the implementation of the di framework
[07:54:32] <teegee> the standard .net core
[07:54:35] <gufi> but in theory that souldnt really matter much
[07:55:08] <gufi> if you need to control the creation time just new it up during configuration and use instance as singleton
[08:01:22] <teegee> that's what i'm doing at the moment. loading plugins and passing them into AddSingleton(). I was just wondering what happens when we hand it a type instead of an instance

[08:10:09] <MizMahem> I doubt it specifies in the doc. You could look at the code though.
[08:10:16] <MizMahem> My guess would be it instances when you ask for it.
[08:14:16] <teegee> I read that carrying the serviceCollection around in your project is bad habit. how does one solve that problem when you have to ask for a specific instance of a class?
[08:16:23] <teegee> I've wrapped the serviceCollection in a static class that has a get method which calls GetServices().FirstOrDefault(s => s.id == id) where id gets passed in. Is that lose enough?
[08:16:57] <teegee> loose
[08:21:24] <gufi> you should avoid using the service collection at all
[08:22:58] <teegee> and instead?
[08:23:14] <gufi> just  have the stuff injected into the class that requires it
[08:24:30] <teegee> but how will the DI framework which of the multiple instances I have of my class is the right one?
[08:24:49] <gufi> are they all the same implementation of a single interface?
[08:24:54] <teegee> yes
[08:26:00] <gufi> two ways to accomplish that, inject a collection of Iwhatevers or use a factory that has the Iwhatevers injected and factory.Getthisone(someenum or /typeof) at best, other than that you could use marker interfaces IWhatever2:Iwhatever

[11:29:45] <canton7> I think it was this thing: https://nandgame.com/
[11:31:40] <MizMahem> if Miz was designing programming education there would be one session in compsci 101 (or maybe 102) where they start talking about stack vs heap, and what not, how classes and such are laid out, how that interacts with inheritance and what not, and there they could take like 15 minutes or so during that to talk about this.
[11:31:49] <MizMahem> okay maybe that's compsci 201 I dunno.
[11:32:11] <MizMahem> I'd audit such a course :p

[12:28:46] <Intelo> response might have been ok, just to test what was created, I should return what was inserted / updated in database for each api call c) try to check one api with another api (this might not always be possible). e.g test create user api with user profile api.

[15:11:37] <jmer> Tazy: he was very religious in his choice of software for the company I worked for. we were entirely Microsoft based (like most danish companies) and he kept suggesting linux based solutions and forced us to spend 8 months hacking away at a shitty opensource wiki written in PHP called "TikiWiki"

[15:13:09] <Tazy> but now we can't even use AVX cause Azure does not support it, and we hitting CPU bottle necks cause of single threads
[15:13:49] <jmer> Tazy: I'm not saying MS is always the right choice, I just expect a consultant to be less tied to "religion" :P
[15:13:59] <Tazy> Yeah I agree that is a bit odd
[15:14:12] <jmer> Tazy: we spent 8 months trying to hack this TikiWiki shit into something useful and we had to throw it all away

[15:15:35] <planetcall|work> I haven't tried but I am not sure why I wouldn't be able to.
[15:16:00] <planetcall|work> AWS and Azure both have their strength and weakness and I don't see anyone as being best or worst
[15:16:15] <Tazy> planetcall|work, well the problem comes into the MSA
[15:16:41] <planetcall|work> For most use cases either one is a good pick. Some factors to consider are the tech stack, tooling, price negotiations etc.
[15:16:47] <Tazy> AWS says we share reponsibility, and you can bring whatever you want in, in MS domain etc, Azure, goes you are on your own, and you can't bring any other tools in '
[15:16:59] <Tazy> Azure generally also costs more
[15:20:44] <jmer> Tazy: have you tried developing Sharepoint plugins?
[15:20:57] <Tazy> jmer, happy to say I have not
[15:21:04] <jmer> Try and keep it that way
[15:21:05] <Tazy> I have helped someone debug one, it was a PITA
[15:21:07] <jmer> it fucking sucks
[15:21:28] <jmer> You know, Sharepoint addin development is probably the only thing I can think of that's just as bad as Sitecore development.
[15:23:40] <Tazy> well capgemini seems to really focus on their people. First company to be like,we don't want you traveling more than an hour (hour an a half max) one way to work or a client, so that you can have a `private` life

[16:08:23] <jmer> the rules apparantlyu are like "the closest facade to the road, that doesn't have a wet room"... and basically the entire wall of that house is wet rooms until you hit my office where I want the cable to go in xD
[16:08:43] <jmer> also we are getting the keys later today \o/

[17:43:47] <gufi> yea its gonna suck
[17:43:58] <JakeSays> brianonymous: step 1: install linux
[17:44:04] <brianonymous> i wish i could
[17:45:00] <MizMahem> ah, because ref structs cannot be generics I guess.
[17:45:06] <MizMahem> hmm... :/
[17:45:11] <gufi> step two: "hey it... some one installed linux and it doesnt work, send windows machine"
[17:50:21] <jonp> MizMahem: eh? they should be able to be generic…
[17:50:27] <jonp> e.g. Span<T> is a generic ref struct
[17:50:42] <MizMahem> jonp: I mean I don't think they can be used as generic parameters.
[17:50:58] <MizMahem> you can do ValueTuple<RefStruct> I think.
[17:51:03] <jonp> not sure about that.  i'd hope so?  but might require extra stuff
[17:51:19] <MizMahem> Or I could be wrong, but I don't think you can put 'em into tuples, and I'm assuming this is the reason.

[18:58:44] <canton7> So it looks a lot like a more general rule of "ref structs cannot be generic type arguments"

[19:17:46] <sysRPL> so i guess
[19:17:58] <sysRPL> i am going to write a libc implementation for windows
[19:18:10] <jonp> er, why?
[19:18:27] <sysRPL> too many of the projects i build from c on linux require libc
[19:18:41] <jonp> ...and...?
[19:18:43] <sysRPL> and on linux linking is as simple as -lc
[19:18:50] <sysRPL> but on windows, that doesn't work
[19:18:52] <jonp> msvcrt.dll is a C runtime for Windows.

[19:20:02] <sysRPL> i have't been able to get mingw to link to any ms crt
[19:20:10] <sysRPL> mingq even
[19:20:10] <jonp> why not?
[19:20:17] <jonp> the C ABI should be the same
[19:20:43] <sysRPL> because when i try to linkan exe to ms crts the linker doesn't like the ms crt dlls
[19:20:52] <jonp> what's the error?
[19:20:57] <jonp> what does "doesn't like" *mean*?
[19:20:59] <sysRPL> function not found
[19:21:05] <jonp> ok, which function?
[19:21:14] <jonp> msvcrt is just C89, not the entire libc

[19:21:43] <sysRPL> yeah i know

[19:22:11] <sysRPL> e
[19:22:14] <jonp> certainly
[19:22:31] <sysRPL> well on windows i am not sure which linker is being used
[19:22:36] <sysRPL> on linux it's ld
[19:22:44] <sysRPL> on windows it's ?
[19:23:10] <jonp> depends on your toolchain
[19:23:23] <jonp> VC has an LD.EXE, iirc
[19:24:07] <sysRPL> i am using fpc
[19:24:13] <jonp> er, no; LINK.EXE: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/linking?view=msvc-160
[19:24:15] <sysRPL> which is why i think lib files are useless
[19:24:54] <sysRPL> i'll try to pass a ms crt to the whatever linker fpc is using
[19:25:06] <sysRPL> btw, which ms crt should i use?
[19:25:07] <jonp> i don't know the answer there
[19:25:10] <sysRPL> there are many

[23:17:58] <moose> I wonder what would be more efficient... having a thread pull messages from a ConcurrentQueue<T> or using a continuation to do work asynchronously right off of the producer thread
[23:18:27] <moose> I expect to need burst capacity and be overloaded occasionally, but probably not often.
[23:19:08] <jonp> i'd guess the continuation?  not sure.
[23:19:54] <moose> I was thinking it would be quicker to add to the queue and then continue receiving data, while another thread processes the queue and queues up responses for yet another thread to send off those.
