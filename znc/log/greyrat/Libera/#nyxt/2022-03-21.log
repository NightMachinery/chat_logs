[12:51:10] <Josh_2> Hey, Nyxt can run headless now right?
[12:51:22] <Josh_2> Does this mean it can be used for webcrawling with JS?

[15:43:42] <Josh_2> :(
[16:25:15] <Josh_2> I'm trying to click on an element using a command from the repl, but I can't find the plump tree anywhere
[16:34:02] <aartaka> Josh_2: is `document-model` of buffer empty?
[16:34:28] <Josh_2> Excuse my blindness :(
[16:34:51] <Josh_2> Also I have cloned from master and there appears to be a bug where I cannot Ctrl-g the history buffer
[16:35:00] <Josh_2> my repl complains about a condition being signalled
[16:35:11] <Josh_2> Function types are not a legal argument to TYPEP:
[16:37:28] <Josh_2> Do you have convenience functions for searching the plump tree?
[16:41:03] <mariari> as a side note serapeum has a lot of neat functions in it
[16:42:34] <aartaka> Josh_2: See `clss:select`, it should fit most purposes :)
[16:45:41] <Josh_2> Thanks :)
[16:53:21] <Josh_2> Okay I found the button I want to click, how do I click it from the repl?
[16:53:58] <Josh_2> Its a button that downloads using JS
[16:55:29] <Josh_2> YAY
[16:55:33] <Josh_2> I made it work!
[16:57:06] <aartaka> :D
[17:21:53] <Josh_2> How do I change buffers from the repl?
[17:22:21] <Josh_2> When I initiate a download my buffer is changed, I need to go back to the previous buffer to download the next in the list
[17:32:46] <aartaka> Josh_2: `switch-buffer-previous`, `switch-buffer-next`, `switch-buffer` are commands you need here.
[17:34:59] <Josh_2> Alright thanks
[17:35:24] <Josh_2> I'm sure there is a better way to do this, perhaps I can stop it redirecting to the downloads page? Perhaps I can modify the download functionality?
[17:35:26] <aartaka> Josh_2: or you can let-bind the buffer you need and use `with-current-buffer`.
[17:37:23] <aartaka> Josh_2: Downloads buffer popping us is not exactly easy to suppress, as it is a reaction to WebKit event AFAIR.
[17:38:01] <Josh_2> Okay, because I want to do this without rendering a gtk window
[17:38:04] <Josh_2> I want to do it headless
[17:44:28] <Josh_2> can I perform a click for a different buffer when my current buffer has beome the downloads one?

[17:54:18] <aartaka> Josh_2: Yes, you can.
[17:54:51] <aartaka> Although it depends on how exactly you perform a click.
[17:55:30] <Josh_2> I am just using

[18:43:35] <aartaka> Josh_2: `with-current-cuffer` with the buffer you want to run it in should be enough then.
[18:43:51] <aartaka> *`with-current-buffer`

[19:38:07] <TuLithu> Does Nyxt have a way to copy and yank multiple fields on a web page form at once?
[19:43:34] <waleee> not at once afaik, but copy & yank is appended in the ring buffer used for the clipboard
[19:44:00] <waleee> (so you can still acccess the fields even if they are copied on at a time)
[19:44:40] <waleee> the command paste-from-clipboard-ring will give you a prompt to select items in the ring
[19:45:55] <waleee> hmm or so I assumed why didn't that work
