[00:37:33] <flatcap> adray: I don't there's any simple way to do that.  crucially, altering m->emails[] invalidates m->v2r[] (which is the array of sorted/limited emails), so be careful
[00:38:37] <adray> flatcap: is it possible to purge all messages with e->active == false?
[00:41:58] <flatcap> er, dunno.  I'm busy atm, I'll be free in a couple of hours

[03:07:05] <flatcap> adray: I remember thinking that e->active was an ugly hack (I'd been reading the maildir code)
[03:08:39] <flatcap> maildir has the problem of syncing a Mailbox to a dir, when files might have been renamed
[03:15:04] <adray> i'm thinking in context of notmuch. nm_mbox_check marks all emails inactive, executes the query again, and marks still queried emails as active. but that leaves emails marked as inactive (they're no longer part of the query) which persist in the index
[03:17:12] <flatcap> I'm sure one of the mailboxes used qsort() to move all the unwanted Emails to the end of the Mailbox
[03:18:18] <flatcap> then you can reduce m->msg_count and email_free() the ones you don't want

[03:41:44] <adray> i might look into that. though performance would be bad on large mailboxes, right?
[03:42:48] <flatcap> possibly not.  qsort() is pretty efficient.  what's the alternative? ...
[03:43:00] <flatcap> iterate through the array and copy into another array?
[03:43:24] <flatcap> or iterate and memmove() LOTS of time to shuffle the existing entries
[04:00:50] <adray> copying into another array might be more efficient actually. the code already iterates over query. i'll have to think about it (especially with the relation to v2r)
