[00:51:20] <Activ8> ooof man shot dead in London not long ago.  Attempted bank robbery lol
[00:51:41] <Activ8> how fucking stupid UK police don’t fuck about lol
[00:51:56] <Cl0udSanta> I know robbery is sort of a thing in the UK, but didnt they like, not used to use guns often?
[00:52:15] <Activ8> They don’t he’s probably pulled out a firearm on police
[00:52:23] <Activ8> police WILL shoot you if you have a weapon 
[00:52:30] <Cl0udSanta> fair enough
[00:52:34] <DrZak> arent uk police the sad people without guns chasing crooks who have guns?
[00:52:37] <DrZak> :)
[00:52:45] <Cl0udSanta> right thats what I was gettin at DrZak lol
[00:52:49] <Activ8> no armed response has guns
[00:52:57] <Activ8> we have different response units
[00:53:08] <DrZak> ah right
[00:53:08] <Activ8> depends how serious things are we have categories 
[00:53:24] <Activ8> a bank armed robbery is instant arms response lol
[00:53:33] <Cl0udSanta> so if average joe cop gets in to some shit, he has to run away and call for backup? *flashbacks of monty python and the holy grail 'RUN AWAAAAY'*
[00:53:45] <Activ8> no 
[00:53:53] <Activ8> he has a panic button
[00:54:02] <Cl0udSanta> does it call Life Alert?
[00:54:05] <Cl0udSanta> :D
[00:54:06] <Activ8> if they press that on their coat every u it in the area turns up
[00:54:14] <Activ8> unit*
[00:54:30] <Cl0udSanta> is it like a silent alarm?
[00:54:37] <Activ8> Yeh
[00:54:45] <Cl0udSanta> thats actually a pretty neat tech
[00:54:59] <Activ8> except all cop cars get the alert and location straight away within 0.01 second lol
[00:55:09] <Cl0udSanta> too bad here in the US every cop would be pushin that button so many times it'd have to be replaced monthly
[00:55:36] <Activ8> the police are taught to press it only if it’s their last thing they do the UK cops are trained very well
[00:55:50] <Activ8> would never fire or press that until the absolute last thing they do
[00:55:54] <Activ8> and it works
[00:56:01] <Cl0udSanta> I remember watchin a video of some US police watching UK police training and they were like 'nah bro'

[23:35:07] <Cl0udSanta> DrZak, when I got my own computer I was allowed to have in my room, the guy I got it from included a bunch of pirated shit, one of which was Dude Wheres my Car, but it had chinese subtitles embedded. I always thought it was funny that 'dude wheres my car' and 'wheres your car dude' were just the same subtitle being flashed on the screeen

[23:40:45] <Cl0udSanta> also reminds me that I'm super happy my mom was oblivious because she let slip like 5 pornos too, which was obviously fantastic
