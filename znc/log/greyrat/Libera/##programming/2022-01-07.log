[00:00:02] <pulse> apotheon, one of my worst programming experiences ever was being forced to write a lengthy bash script for OS class
[00:00:08] <nomagno> sh is VERY good for text processing, because it's essentially the only thing you're ever going to want it for
[00:00:15] <oldlaptop> The argument (seems airtight to me) is that C's semantics, as specified, formally limit it to some finite number of objects, each of finite size.

[00:00:22] <pulse> professor disallowed calling any external programs other than a few select ones
[00:00:24] <apotheon> nomagno: What do you mean?
[00:00:27] <nomagno> It's not even fair when you start comparing actual programming languages to chaining *nix tools
[00:00:29] <nomagno> at least naturality-wise
[00:00:29] <pyzozord> oldlaptop: aren't all computer programs running on real computers LBA? All computers have limited memory
[00:00:35] <pulse> it was really miserable. almost nobody passed that. i did by some luck but it was beyond frustrating
[00:00:36] <deniska> Another weird thing about powershell is that if you actually want to shellout to an external tool, often you end up using explicit call to Start-Process or whatever it's called
[00:00:40] <pulse> i have a very poor opinion of bash since then
[00:00:48] <oldlaptop> Most other languages have nothing in their specifications preventing them from addressing unbounded memory, at least in principle. C (allegedly) does.
[00:00:59] <deniska> And then instead of `foo bar baz` you have `Start-Process -executable foo -args bar,baz` or however it's spelled
[00:01:00] <apotheon> pulse: You shouldn't write Bash scripts at all.  Use sh or use a real programming language.
[00:01:03] <oldlaptop> Obviously all real computers are only LBA-complete, so it's a silly, pedantic point :)
[00:01:05] <nomagno> apotheon: Unix util chaining is far better for text/data stream processing
[00:01:10] <deniska> which is neither looking good as a shell, neither as a PL :)

[02:00:47] <Decker> fork() form of threading is different... that's something cygwin also tries to provide just native support for

[04:07:06] <apotheon> I'm highly skeptical of "one guy on Quora" saying things that don't seem to fit with reality.  If it's true, I expect some kind of mitigating circumstances (e.g. "the majority of Windows servers are strictly network-internal access" or "we're counting cases where compromise of a single machine automatically compromised 4K VMs").
[04:07:15] <pulse> especially taking into account how far the whole Windows Server ecosystem has gotten
[04:07:36] <pulse> yeah i'm skeptical too, honestly i would expect the numbers of hacks to be skewed towards Windows Server

[06:32:04] <apotheon> The same principle applies everywhere that things are based on magic numbers -- in code, in school, in traffic laws, and in the design of active collision avoidance systems.
[06:32:47] <PlanckWalk> There is probably a ratchet effect too.  As people become accustomed to safety features, they come to rely on them, and cars that don't have them end up in more accidents *than they would if the safety features didn't exist*.

[06:33:34] <apotheon> An example of a magic number approach going horribly awry was a few years that there were insurance benefits to getting orange cars.
[06:33:51] <pulse> PlanckWalk, maybe. but then again maybe not. you get a pretty good jolt from those active systems, it's a shock for most people. i would imagine you would want to avoid that for the shock alone
[06:33:59] <pulse> but idk, i'm not that far into the psychology of it, lol
[06:34:12] <apotheon> That was based on the idea that orange cars stood out and got into fewer accidents.  That went straight to shit when people bought more orange cars to get better insurance rates, thus making orange cars no longer stand out.

[11:56:24] <Duality> question 
[11:57:41] <gry> ?
[11:57:48] <Duality> what if I have some memory of shorts and cast this to (unsigned char *) does the compiler know that after casting that array[1] is the second byte of the first element/address ? or will it skip to the next memory address (I would think not but not usre
[11:57:52] <Duality> sure*
[11:58:53] <Duality> i have some eeprom but it's data size is 2 (2 bytes per address) but want to access it as if it were an array of bytes

[12:12:06] <sonny> you don't have to use VS btw
[12:12:21] <mrig> I'm using only the compiler at the moment.
[12:13:06] <mrig> the IDE just for the debugger but following along with a course so It's nice to use the same set up, or close to it.

[12:15:29] <sonny> no clue, but the compile time is noticeable
[12:15:45] <sonny> VS is slow itself too
[12:16:13] <mrig> It could be that it is due to the changes in the code, difficult to know. As this is a renderer in software, it gets heavy pretty fast.
[12:16:17] <mrig> yes it is.

[14:33:51] <vdamewood> s/also no/no/
[14:36:29] <mickey8> okay. i understood there are 2 approaches. one way is to UPDATE users SET avgscore=(SELECT avg(score) ..) or so, and the other is to UPDATE users JOIN content SET users.avgscore = avg(content.score) or something like that. sorry for the syntax im just trying to write in resaonable time lol
[14:36:52] <mickey8> the join approach keeps failing on syntax errors, because sqlite doesn't like UPDATE and JOIN together or something
[14:37:30] <mickey8> the UPDATE with inner SELECT keeps updating the whole table. i tried with group by and without, with a where and without
[14:38:24] <mickey8> i.e., this works fine for 1 user: update users set avgscore = (select avg(score) from content where user_id =555); but if i try update users set avgscore = (select avg(score) from content where user_id = users.id); then no go

[16:44:17] <sub0> cerl, btw, the answer is:  prog -ArgumentList @($args;" "). and it gets even uglier if you want to add your own arguments. this is the point when I decided to keep using batchfile, because just running other programs, with additional argument or two, is 99% of the time I'd use batch file (or powershell). anything much more complex than that, and I'd use a real language
[16:44:39] <vdamewood> mrig: Okay, so far so okay.

[17:28:21] <FloridaMan> I haven't been following this conversation since the beginning, but from what I've seen, build systems are meant to solve strange oddities in custom build code like this by making things pretty standard... And you benefit from all the optimization and checks built into the build system.
[17:28:27] <FloridaMan> That's my opinion, anyway.
[17:28:52] <mrig> Sure, but this is not supposed to be standardised, it's kind of the point.

[17:52:45] <mrig> oh just not to clutter up the source code directory.
[17:53:23] <mrig> When using an editor rather than an IDE the file structure is used more heavily for organisation, it would seem.
[17:53:32] <FloridaMan> yeah that's what I mean with the VCS ignore files... As for the files themselves sticking around, it's generally a trade-off that comes with being able to have project-specific settings for the IDE
[17:53:50] <mrig> so the less there is in there that is not directly relevant to the program the better.
[17:54:04] <FloridaMan> depends on whether you use the IDE's features I guess

[18:46:40] <wedr> Programming a pizza is easier than baking a pizza, nuff said.
[18:47:06] <InPhase> Well, it's more like running a script someone else wrote for pizza dough.  :)
[18:48:22] <InPhase> Although you can tweak your own ingredient list if you like.  Most important to pay attention to is to make sure you're using bread flour and not all purpose flour for a pizza dough.  The gluten content in bread flour yields the right texture.  It's not a cake.
[18:48:27] <wedr> nice, and we can run the script to a Raspberry PI hooked up to a dough making machine, and execute sequences in order.

[18:54:49] <NGC3982> hi. im running VBA code in excel (365) and im trying to add an event where i add a network drive to the users computer. the code i use is 'Call Shell("cmd.exe /S /C net use T: \\work\Temp", vbHide)'. the cmd command works flawlessly and takes a tenth of a second when running directly in cmd, but takes almost 15 seconds to complete when running as VBA code. what can i do to prevent this? the series 
[18:54:54] <apotheon> InPhase: I have an old dishwasher, so "rinsing" is like "washing" without soap.
[18:54:55] <NGC3982> of events make it important for the user not to wait longer for this than the user waits for the cmd command to complete.
[18:55:22] <ProfSimm> What about a language where everything is linear (move only semantics), and so nothing can be copied or referenced implicitly

[18:56:31] <NGC3982> hehe, i thought so
[18:56:50] <apotheon> Someone might surprise me, though.
[18:57:17] <InPhase> apotheon: I've had many old dishwashers stop cleaning well.  It's almost always accumulated food sludge or plastic waste in the spinning water dispensing arms, or underneath in the water intake.  Spending an hour cleaning that up usually turns it back to close to new performance.
[18:57:32] <apotheon> It seems pulse loves Windows, and ProfSimm is at least sympathetic to the things Windows has in common with MacOS, I think.
[18:58:06] <apotheon> InPhase: In this case, it's probably more because the dishwasher is literally from the '70s.
[18:58:19] <pulse> i do love windows

[18:58:56] <ProfSimm> apotheon: I'm not sympathetic to specific, but to principles
[18:58:58] <pulse> i don't think i've ever even used vba
[18:59:00] <NGC3982> when i google, it seems like the time spent is 'loading the shell'

[18:59:12] <InPhase> apotheon: Yeah.  I've inherited some ancient ones from previous owners.  It's much nicer to replace them, but the cleaning typically does work.  :)

[19:00:48] <NGC3982> the use here is to make sure that a network drive has not been disconnected before doing other script stuff (in this case, writing to a file on said network drive)
[19:00:51] <apotheon> disclaimer: I don't use Windows.
[19:01:05] <NGC3982> and, the net use command in cmd simply ignores the command if the drive is already mounted, and otherwise mounts it

[21:34:51] <bjs> pyzozord: so you say to the hardware "here are some page tables" then when the hardware sees a virtual address (e.g. from a user-land program) it will use those tables you gave it to figure out where the physical memory is and if it's allowed to read/write/etc

[21:36:46] <bjs> the OS decides what this function is, and then the user-mode programs (e.g. your C program, your browser, etc) all have their addresses turned into real memory locations by the hardware running that function.
[21:37:13] <pyzozord> ooh right, the physical-virtual address mapping is indeed built into cpus, I saw in intel manuals that cpus have multiple memory modes
[21:37:20] <GeDaMo> Each process has its own virtual address space which is how they are kept separate

[21:45:59] <snailexpress> hey all, I've got a question about CDNs, like Cloudflare or Fastly.  There's something I really don't get, no matter how many docs and howto I read and any help would be greatly appreciated.
[21:46:01] <mrig> man this is so buggy it's not possible :(
[21:46:08] <snailexpress> Say I've got a server, serving webpages. It has a static IP address.  I want to add Cloudflare on top of it for some static assets.  What do I need to do and how does it work?
[21:46:13] <node1> sorry rows of each table size is 1024 byte*
[21:46:24] <mrig> really am thinking of trying a reinstall again.
[21:46:57] <Amadiro> snailexpress, there are a few things you might presumably do, but essentially you configure your CDN(s) to "layer on top of your server". The CDN is a "redirect", so the client hits the CDN, and then the CDN hits (or not) your server
[21:47:37] *** Joins: Shashin (~Shashin@cpc112711-nmal22-2-0-cust53.19-2.cable.virginm.net)
[21:47:42] <pyzozord> snailexpress: cdns are really like static web hosting, they just have many server around the globe so they can serve your static files to your users from the server that's the closes to them. You simply just upload your static fiels to cdns
[21:47:46] <node1> I'm confused.  But i think we must predict the time and space occupied on a disk before saving the data on disk.
[21:47:47] <snailexpress> Amadiro: I understand the big picture but I don't get the details.  For example, I need to point my DNS record to use Cloudflare's IP for my domain?  But then how does Cloudflare know where to fetch my stuff?
[21:47:55] <Amadiro> snailexpress, in the modern world, if your server is serving web-pages, there's a good chance you don't actually want to cache them in the CDN, what's most efficient to cache are static resources (which more often than not, nowadays, come from S3 or similar), but ultimately the response from your server has a header that tells the CDN for how long the served website is valid
[21:48:29] <snailexpress> Amadiro: I just want to cache the static.mydomain.com assets, the ones really static (pictures / videos)
[21:48:52] <Amadiro> snailexpress, it's common to have a secondary dns entry for stuff on the CDN, like `cdn.mysite.com` and then to load assets from there, but fundamentally yes, you need to both configure your DNS entry to point to cloudflare, and in the cloudflare UI to configure the origin
[21:49:20] <Amadiro> the easiest to get started with is probably S3 + cloudfront
[21:49:37] <snailexpress> Amadiro: oh, so for the DNS stuff pointing to Cloudflare, users only ever see the Cloudflare servers?   And it's Cloudflare that knows where the "real" origin is?
[21:49:44] <Amadiro> But it's also a bit of a question as to why you want to use a CDN in the first place -- are you trying to save cost or speeding up the user experience?

[21:53:49] <Amadiro> snailexpress, yes, fastly is probably the hardest to set up (at least if you write the varnish config yourself). Also slight correction to my "yes" earlier, the client might also still see the origin if you decide to reveal it (not everything is usually cached)
[21:54:13] *** Joins: ProfSimm (~ProfSimm@87.227.196.109)
[21:54:25] <Amadiro> snailexpress, also note that caching video has a lot of nuances unto itself (I used to work on that for a video streaming service once upon a time), you need to make sure the video is served in the right format and that your CDN is aware that it's streaming video
[21:54:34] <deniska> node1: larger block size means more overhead for small files (two files can't share the same block on many (most?) filesystems), smaller block size means more overhead for larger files (because it takes more space to list blocks files have)
[21:54:47] <deniska> At least that's how it works in simpler filesystems like FAT32
[21:54:50] <Amadiro> if you at all can, I would probably recommend to just embed youtube, vimeo or kaltura or similar -- creating a smooth video playback experience around the globe is quite challenging

[21:55:59] <Amadiro> snailexpress, also if you really care about good video playback perf around the globe, you need to adaptively choose the geographically best CDN using a multicast address (e.g. ngenix in russia etc)

[22:01:24] <node1> deniska, yes filesystem stores files in limit. When i'm saying  limit means in a block. And when you have the default block size fixed i.e 4096 means  your file is being molded or get in chunk of 4096 bytes 
[22:01:26] <bjs> node1: when you write software you (usually) don't have to worry about that,  because the harddrive itself has some little computer on it to work out where on the spinny disk to put the data
[22:01:42] <Amadiro> snailexpress, ultimately you can do whatever you want, yeah. Many people use a CDN as a passive "pass-through" also, even if the CDN caches nothing. That can make sense and speed things up, because sometimes CDNs have private fiber that they rent, and even routing a non-cached request through the CDNs private fiber can result in a far better route
[22:02:08] <deniska> node1: as far as your program is aware, files are arrays of bytes
[22:02:09] <Amadiro> and the CDN might have some "protective" features, so if you never reveal your actual origin, it might get harder to attack it, so it can be advantageous that way
[22:02:09] <snailexpress> Amadiro: btw, thanks it helps a lot already (even if I still don't get it)

[22:03:33] <node1> table means normal Mysql database table.
[22:03:36] <snailexpress> concretely: if I'm serving snailexpress.com (dynamic website) from my own IP, with a DNS A record (?) pointing to my server's IP...

[22:06:29] <Amadiro> snailexpress, realistically you probably wouldn't make the request go back to your server but instead push the large assets to something like an S3 bucket, so that your server is not burdened with them -- but doesn't really matter
[22:06:46] <Amadiro> snailexpress, you can look at the request headers, they typically contain a bunch of information the CDN tacks in there. I don't know if that's going to be super helpful though

[22:07:22] <snailexpress> Amadiro: but it the asset is "forever cacheable" (say stored using as a name a hash of its content) and marked as forever cachable, then Cloudflare should only fetch it once right?
[22:07:54] <node1> ok
[22:08:15] <snailexpress> Amadiro: I've read in the docs already about the additional infos CDN add, so yup, that's a great tip: I'll check that.
[22:08:44] <Amadiro> snailexpress, this is not guaranteed, because cloudflare itself needs to manage memory and disk space on their edge nodes (also called PoPs), so if an asset is not requested for a long time, it might decide to evict it
[22:09:11] <Amadiro> the diskspace and memory on each PoP is finite, so it has to make some decisions eventually on what to evict
[22:09:13] <bjs> node1: it's configurable (as sqlite databases can be either very very tiny or incredibly large and the format scales with that),  so it's probably not very easy to "guess" how much actual space an actual table will *actually* use on disk (also it'll depend on the actual data of course, how many rows and what is stored in the rows...

[22:14:00] <snailexpress> Amadiro: oh that is sweet (it's a bit clearer too)
[22:14:05] <bjs> node1: if you want to understand how databases can do fast indexing, it's because it (redundantly) stores (some) of the data of the table again in a big sorted tree structure (see those b-tree portions of the file?)
[22:14:08] <[itchyjunk]> stupid tutorials ALL use `data Maybe a` as an example
[22:14:20] <[itchyjunk]> why does every tutorial only want to use that and only that?
[22:15:07] <Amadiro> snailexpress, most CDNs also offer you lots of proprietary features (who's value proposition might be questionable at times), with things like OriginShield to prevent your origin from being discovered to automated machine-learning driven blocking to prevent DDoS and such
[22:15:27] <snailexpress> And if I want to have every request to my server hit the IP of my dedicated server(s) first, I make sure that the DNS, for "snailexpress.com" and "www.snailexpress.com", point to my server(s)'s IP(s).   But then what do I do to configure that static.snailexpress.com is a CDN?  A CNAME?  A NS?  (no networking guru here as you can tell)
[22:15:28] <Amadiro> snailexpress, but at the most basic level it's just a man-in-the-middle that sits between any request from the browser and an origin of your choosing
[22:15:32] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: I'd guess that Maybe is a nice example as it kind of demonstrates all the features. Making your own `data` declarations is very common in Haskell and so I'd assume pretty much any tutorial which may start with Maybe would soon have lots of examples too

[22:18:09] <GeDaMo> 'a' is a generic type
[22:18:13] <[itchyjunk]> `data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a`, we have do data constructor
[22:18:29] <[itchyjunk]> Nothing represents when a is absent
[22:18:41] <[itchyjunk]> Just a is a data whose type is Maybe a
[22:18:51] <[itchyjunk]> that's what i think i understand so far
[22:18:51] <GeDaMo> 'Nothing' is a constructor which takes no parameters
[22:18:53] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: so the left-hand side says you have types like `Maybe Int` and `Maybe Bool` and so-on. The right-hand side says things like `Nothing` and `Just 42` and `Just False` are members of those types.

[22:19:08] <snailexpress> Amadiro: it's much clearer really thanks to your explanation.  A big part I obviously missed is that you configure the "origin" on the CDN.  I know can see that mentioned in several docs: but it didn't click previously.
[22:19:18] <[itchyjunk]> bjs, yes so far so good
[22:19:20] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: `let x :: Maybe Int = Just 42`, or `let y :: Maybe Bool = Nothing`  are both good
[22:19:24] <snailexpress> s/know/now/
[22:19:40] <[itchyjunk]> right, makes sense
[22:20:03] *** Quits: trevors (~trevors@user/trevors) (Quit: trevors)
[22:20:29] <[itchyjunk]> Nothing and Just blah both satisfy the requirement of being a Maybe a type
[22:20:31] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: so you have 1 `Maybe` declaration that works for many types.  That's why you may want parameters to type constructors.
[22:20:51] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: right but note that `Just 5` and `Just True` are not the same type. They are both "Maybe" types, but one has an Int and one has a Bool
[22:21:09] <[itchyjunk]> so i have `data List a = blah | blah`
[22:21:18] <GeDaMo> Actually, my BinTree example wasn't right data BinTree a = Branch a (BinTree a) (BinTree a) | Leaf a
[22:21:32] <GeDaMo> The Branch needs a value to define left and right
[22:21:36] <[itchyjunk]> from what i read, Maybe is not a type but a type constructor `Maybe a` is a type. so `Maybe Int` is one type and `Maybe Bool` is another type
[22:21:42] <Amadiro> snailexpress, my pleasure. CDNs are pretty complex beasts nowadays, but the fundamental principle is pretty simple after all
[22:21:50] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: yes that is correct.
[22:21:59] <[itchyjunk]> so `data List a = Nil | blah `
[22:22:00] <bjs> Maybe on its own is not a type in Haskell.
[22:22:03] <[itchyjunk]> i understand up till here
[22:22:04] <GeDaMo> Maybe isn't a constructor, you can't instantiate a Maybe directly only Just or Nothing
[22:22:40] <[itchyjunk]> now i want the blah to say that List a is just a along with List a
[22:22:45] <Amadiro> snailexpress, some combos like cloudfront into S3 are easiest to configure (because both are made by aws), but something like fastly really gives you the most flexibility and features (at the cost of you having to actually write code to configure it)

[22:23:30] <[itchyjunk]> Cons is a new data value you're defining there?
[22:23:37] <GeDaMo> Cons is a constructor
[22:23:44] <snailexpress> Amadiro: would you happen to know what happens re- SSL certificates in the case where I serve my own dynamic website (no CDN) but then use a CDN for static assets?   They'd be on "https://static.snailexpress.com/..." and I take it it needs a certificate?  Would that be the same one as the one from the domain?  Or would that subdomain need
[22:23:45] <snailexpress> another certificate?

[22:23:53] <GeDaMo> It takes two parameters one is type a, the other is List a

[22:24:02] <GeDaMo> Yes

[22:24:16] <GeDaMo> Yes
[22:24:22] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: so `data List a = EmptyList | SingleElementList a | MultiElementList a a (List a)` has 3 constructors (EmptyList with no parameters, SingleElementList with 1 parameters, and MultiElementList with 3 parameters)
[22:24:25] <[itchyjunk]> i see, this is making more sense now

[22:26:04] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: equivalent is a strong word.  It doesn't have the same names, or the same number of constructors, but it's one (perhaps kind of dumb) way to define a list-like datatype.

[22:27:35] <Amadiro> snailexpress, take that with a grain of salt though, it's been a while since I've done this, and I think how this actually works varies a bit from CDN to CDN
[22:27:36] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: lisp really only has 1 datastructure and cons is the "cons"tructor

[22:27:54] <[itchyjunk]> lisp has only one data structure? wtf?
[22:28:25] <[itchyjunk]> i should have those the `Cons` in the rhs as something akin to a function
[22:28:25] <Decker> :)
[22:28:25] <GeDaMo> Some implementations have other data structures

[22:28:35] <[itchyjunk]> which is why i was so confused
[22:28:50] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: I mean lisp (at its core) goes back 60 years or something, modern lisps have all kinds of fancy features but cons goes all the way back
[22:28:53] <deniska> cons is a function which returns an instance of that datastructure
[22:28:58] <snailexpress> [itchyjunk]: the OG Lisps basically only had the list, and made everything from that.  Newer dialects like Clojure have shortcuts handy for lists/vectors/maps(associative arrays), sets etc.   #{}   {}   []   ()

[23:30:41] <ProfSimm> flakland: every time you reference a variable in this concept, it invokes its copy() constructor. If it's not implemented (as it is not on entities, file handles etc.) then it throws. You can only move it.
[23:32:13] <KillerWasp> I recommend breaking all your external DNS and creating your own DNS with your own domain list!! Do you know how fast it works??? Free of web garbage, and calls the domain in less than a millisecond!! :O
[23:32:28] <flakland> sounds useful if you can install multithreaded plumbing in there
[23:33:00] <ProfSimm> flakland: yes, things are executed out of order and in parallel, when it doesn't break causality
