[17:19:39] <paxton> hi all, sorry for the basic question but i'm having trouble understanding something. even after setting the buffer size to a very high value, i don't see message playback in channels like #znc and so on when i reconnect. is there some kind of setting i'm missing? i have multiple clients configured with clientbuffer, but none of them are online at the same time, so i'm not sure why i'm not getting the messages
[17:32:48] *** Joins: trekkie1701c (~trekkie17@user/trekkie1701c)
[17:40:09] <Khaytsus> You're 100% sure you don't have multiple clients connected?  /msg *status listclients
[17:40:27] <Khaytsus> If you have more than 1, it won't treat any messages as new as a client has seen them
[17:40:32] <Khaytsus> [[Multiple_clients]]
[17:40:33] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Multiple_clients
[17:41:45] <paxton> Khaytsus: it lists 3 from the same IP, each connected to a different network. so i think that's expected / not it? could be wrong though
[17:42:55] <Khaytsus> Nope that would just be "one client" .  I assume "multiple clients" would be >1 connected to a given network
[17:43:22] <Khaytsus> Then odd, by default znc just works..  maybe you've changed some settings
[17:43:44] <Khaytsus> but then again if you're using #znc as an example, it can be pretty quiet in here
[17:44:25] <jm18> <Khaytsus> If you have more than 1, it won't treat any messages as new as a client has seen them  <-- this is definitely configurable because i have mine set to playback regardless
[17:44:38] <paxton> is there any setting that would definitely turn it off? i don't think i've fiddled around too much, only the settings clientbuffer suggests you turn off
[17:44:42] <Khaytsus> jm18: ....  of course you can do that
[17:45:03] <Khaytsus> You can set to not clear query buffers, you can follow th emultiple_clients directions above, etc, etc.
[17:45:07] <paxton> and #znc isn't the only one. since i have logs on, i've been checking to see if there are messages, and there are many in the log on various channels that i don't receive
[17:46:46] <jm18> check the settings under "Flags" under your user
[17:47:32] <Khaytsus> Check MaxBufferSize (global) and Buffer (user) and ChanBufferSize (user)
[17:48:01] <Khaytsus> If you're in webmin, global maximum buffer size, should be eh, reasonable..  I have mine to 500 (default)
[17:48:22] <Khaytsus> then your user settings towards the bottom there's buffer size for channels and queries
[17:48:50] <paxton> i had mine on 500, but set to 5000 temporarily just to see if it would bring back the messages (it didn't)
[17:48:57] <paxton> auto clear chan/ auto clear query are unchecked
[17:49:01] <paxton> i'll check the other settings now
[17:49:06] <Khaytsus> You want those checked...
[17:49:12] <Khaytsus> Becaus eotherwise you're going to get play back over and over
[17:49:25] <paxton> oh, really? i thought clientbuffer suggested to uncheck them, hmm
[17:49:25] <Khaytsus> Because it'll never treat the messages as seen
[17:49:43] *** Quits: siso (debian@premium.znc.bg) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[17:49:50] <jm18> i keep those unchecked so i can see playback if i switch client
[17:50:00] <Khaytsus> If you're setting up clientbuffer, again, read the Multiple Clients link above.  Do _that_ instead.
[17:50:17] <Khaytsus> jm18: ...  You can do it however you want, but..  see the link 
[17:51:02] <jm18> yeah i've read it... i didn't learn about clientbuffer until a while after i set up znc. i'll probably use that when i move server
[17:51:29] <Khaytsus> Again, you'll wind up with channels playing back you've already seen, keep getting the same query over and over, etc

[18:45:39] <MetaNova> hm
[18:46:05] <paxton> i've tweaked a few settings since coming in the channel this morning, i can try to connect with another client and see what happens
[18:46:15] <MetaNova> please do
[18:48:15] <paxton> connected with pax-cell; no playback came through. but i'm still connected here with "laptop"
[18:51:06] <paxton> the last time pax-cell connected was 09/14 so you'd think something would come through
[18:51:18] <MetaNova> paxton: okay, what happens when you do '/msg *status playbuffer #znc'?
[18:51:38] <MetaNova> you should see whatever contents are in the buffer for #znc (since AutoClearChanBuffer is false)
[18:51:47] *** Joins: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn)
[18:54:18] <paxton> MetaNova, yeah, that doesn't result in anything. i know *status is working because it responded to "help" but it didn't respond to playbuffer #znc 
[18:54:27] <MetaNova> um
[18:54:30] <MetaNova> ummmmmmmmmm
[18:54:43] <MetaNova> okay, dump your entire znc.conf file into a paste for me
[18:55:09] <MetaNova> eg, $ cat ~/.znc/configs/znc.conf | nc termbin.com 9999
[18:55:20] <MetaNova> or whatever paste service you prefer
[18:58:51] <Khaytsus> Any passwords to worry about in that?
[18:59:41] <MetaNova> only if they have network passwords, which they shouldn't, unless they're connecting to private/non-public-access networks, which I doubt
[19:03:47] <paxton> the irc passwords were in there, which i've snipped, e.g. 		Server = irc.libera.chat +6697 passwordpassword
[19:03:51] <paxton> pasting now
[19:05:21] <paxton> MetaNova, https://paste.debian.net/hidden/320da3a3
[19:08:21] <MetaNova> unload savebuff from each network (/msg *status unloadmod --type=network savebuff), commit the changes to disk (/msg *status saveconfig)
[19:08:56] <MetaNova> then .. /shut down/ ZNC, start it fresh, reconnect your clients and make sure everything up to that point works as expected
[19:09:21] <Khaytsus> I see clear query is still false in the paste too, those should be yes typically right MetaNova?
[19:09:24] <MetaNova> then, from a non-ZNC connection (just use your regular client with a plain connection, or a separate client like irssi) connect to one of those networks
[19:09:37] <MetaNova> make both the non-ZNC and ZNC connections join a test channel
[19:09:59] <MetaNova> disconnect your ZNC connected client from ZNC, and generate traffic from the non-ZNC client
[19:10:11] <MetaNova> (traffic you know to expect)
[19:10:25] <MetaNova> connect your client to ZNC again, you should see the traffic you generated from the non-ZNC connection
[19:10:41] *** Quits: trekkie1701c (~trekkie17@user/trekkie1701c) (Quit: :P)
[19:10:50] <MetaNova> Khaytsus: the AutoClearQueryBuffer variable actually doesn't matter whatsoever when it comes to channel buffers
[19:11:07] <MetaNova> and can be either True or False if your only concern is persistent channel buffers
[19:11:27] <MetaNova> (and is irrelevant when it comes to channel buffers working as expected)
[19:11:34] <Khaytsus> MetaNova: sorry, both clear vars were set, channel and query
[19:12:08] <MetaNova> persistent buffers (such as is needed with *clientbuffer) require both AutoClearChanBuffer and AutoClearQueryBuffer (if you want persistent queries) to be False
[19:12:27] <MetaNova> if their values are True, nothing is cached unless there are zero clients connected to a given user/network
[19:12:49] <MetaNova> and then anything which is in the buffer, and played back once a client attaches to a given user/network, is cleared
[19:12:53] <MetaNova> because AutoClear is True
[19:13:22] <paxton> alright, let's see here..
[19:13:36] <Khaytsus> Yep, but he says he only has 1 client connected at a time.  Anywho, just wanted to ask, I thought those should be true typicall0 with a single client (or after setting up multiple clients)
[19:17:08] <MetaNova> savebuff is the only thing which stands out to me from that paste as /maybe/ able to influence the behavior of buffers
[19:17:48] <MetaNova> if unloading savebuff/generating traffic from a non-ZNC connection while the ZNC-connected client is disconnected/reconnecting the client to ZNC doesn't work, then, there's something much worse wrong
[19:18:12] <MetaNova> like clients eating playback when they shouldn't, or some sort of clientside "smart"filter going haywire
[19:18:14] <MetaNova> or something
[19:18:54] <MetaNova> just as a sanity check, I performed the same experiment myself, both with and without persistent buffers
[19:19:17] <MetaNova> with persistent buffers it worked fine (<@zero-one1> test1)

[19:23:23] <paxton> okay, joined a ad-hoc test channel with znc/non-znc. disconnected the znc and sent some messages with non-znc, but no playback when i reconnected
[19:23:48] <paxton> after unloading savebuf and restarting, etc, as requested
[19:24:06] <MetaNova> and with persistent buffers, even '/msg *status playbuffer <chan>' does nothing?
[19:25:31] <MetaNova> because, I earlier toggled on persistent buffers, just to verify playbuffer works as expected
[19:25:45] <paxton> what's really freaky is i'm sending messages from the znc now, and they're not appearing in the non-znc; there might be a lag i suppose but i don't autojoin that many channels
[19:25:57] <paxton> checking playbuffer
[19:25:59] <MetaNova> it does https://i.imgur.com/wiCwRlk.png
[19:26:35] <MetaNova> paxton: the messages-I-sent-on-one-client-not-appearing-on-the-other is a separate issue to /all/ buffer playback not working
[19:26:42] <MetaNova> specifically, [[self-message]]
[19:26:42] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/self-message
[19:27:05] <paxton> okay, just checking
[19:27:49] <paxton> no response on playbuffer, same as before
[19:28:06] <paxton> maybe i should go for broke and just start a new config; this is so strange
[19:28:06] <MetaNova> I seriously suspect this is a client issue
[19:28:19] <MetaNova> well, okay, that is an option, BUT
[19:28:25] <paxton> let me try to connect with another client
[19:28:38] <MetaNova> before that I recommend one or two additional steps
[19:28:57] <MetaNova> 1) try a different client (other than the one(s) you've been using to test this), and
[19:29:19] <MetaNova> 2) throw ZNC into debug mode and re-enact the same ZNC/non-ZNC traffic(buffer) generation test
[19:29:53] <paxton> okay, yes, it is a client issue. when disconnecting hexchat and doing the same znc/non-znc test with revolution IRC on android, the playback did appear
[19:29:59] <paxton> sorry to throw everyone on a wild goose chase
[19:31:00] <MetaNova> (if your terminal scrollback is large enough/easy enough to navigate, fine, if not, direct the output to a file, eg: znc -D >./znc-debug.log 2>&1
[19:31:09] <MetaNova> oh
[19:31:11] <MetaNova> great!
[19:31:33] <MetaNova> so, it's hexchat that isn't displaying them?
[19:31:48] <MetaNova> or hexchat was the client that /did/ show the buffer playback?
[19:31:57] <paxton> hexchat is the one not displaying, revolution IRC did display
[19:32:03] <MetaNova> oh really.
[19:32:16] <MetaNova> 2.16.0 was released 5 days ago
[19:32:37] <paxton> let's see.. i'm on 2.14.3
[19:32:42] <paxton> might as well try the new one and see what happens
[19:33:02] <MetaNova> you will also want to consider loading/using https://github.com/TingPing/plugins/blob/master/HexChat/mymsg.lua (to make hexchat able to see messages "you" sent in the playback) and https://github.com/TingPing/plugins/blob/master/HexChat/zncbuffer.lua (for convenience)
[19:34:28] <MetaNova> additional scripts to consider for HexChat+ZNC: https://github.com/TingPing/plugins/blob/master/HexChat/buffextras.lua (nicer *buffextras display/formatting), and https://github.com/TingPing/plugins/blob/master/HexChat/playback.lua (integration with the *playback module, which is optional and not required for persistent buffers/clientbuffer/multiclients)
