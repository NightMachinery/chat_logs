But earlier hashing efforts were also originally believed to be secure and later turned out not to be. There are several places within SQRL where we really (really really) need a one-way function to be absolutely one-way. In those places, we use the invented “EnHash” function:

[01:36:35] <wasamasa> > But, despite the fact that we’re using a protocol normally used for network communication, the use of a system’s local networking stack is not network communications, it is inter-process communications and it is no less secure than if the protocol were encrypted.
