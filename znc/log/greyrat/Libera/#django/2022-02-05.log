[02:02:59] <fikran> Going over some old code that I wrote a few years ago, seeing if I can get it to run.
[02:03:26] <fikran> I see things like this:  from django.conf.urls import url
[02:03:39] <fikran> and then: url(r'', include(('core.urls', 'core'), namespace='core')),
[02:03:45] <fikran> is there a new way to do this?
[02:04:27] <fikran> in short, everything is routed to "core"
[02:05:49] <fikran> i might need to redo some of the documentation. Back in the day I was a beast with Django.

[04:49:27] <fikran> This is the HINT, but I do not understand it: HINT: Configure the DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD setting or the AssetConfig.default_auto_field attribute to point to a subclass of AutoField, e.g. 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'.
[04:54:07] <GinFuyou> fikran, first is you have ArrayField with default=[] somewhere
[04:55:22] <GinFuyou> second is recent changes for ids being by default AutoFields. You can add it to settings, AutoField if you want to keep old default

[20:17:54] <wappyn> I were working as junior for 3 years and got 1 year break, non of my code writen in job is open source now,
[20:18:16] <wappyn> While the old one before this job looks like total sh!@
[20:18:37] <nbjoerg> wappyn: I haven't recruited for a while, but if anything I would say pick one important project and give a short summary of what you actually did
[20:19:19] <wappyn> nbjoerg: oh, but I want to build something new from scratch first
[20:19:28] <wappyn> and I wonder how big this project should be
[20:19:48] <wappyn> I have problem with stoping at some point
[20:19:59] <wappyn> and I can expanse it for 10 years...
[20:20:13] <wappyn> so I want something to compare
[20:20:45] <wappyn> maybe someones actual project who got mid/regular job
[20:20:53] <wappyn> I just wonder what is big enough
[20:21:20] <wappyn> I understand that I can as well just write about project I can't show code of, and describe what I've done.
[20:21:43] <wappyn> But I have to "relearn" anyway after such a break
[20:22:45] <wappyn> and when I'm thinking about projects to do I got cringe feeling when think about some small crud like project, and 1000000 ideas when I think about larger one.
[20:24:07] <wappyn> I don't really know how to descibe it better
[20:26:10] <wappyn> but what I'm asking for is example of "good enough" github portfolio, for someone who wants to get job as regular/mid developer.
[20:28:16] <wappyn> I understand that it depends on so many things, like company itself, technologies people works at specific project etc. But I still have no reference so I can at least plan what I really want to do
[20:30:45] <nbjoerg> wappyn: if you want someone to actually look at it, find something interesting first
[20:31:22] <wappyn> :/
[20:31:34] <wappyn> but
[20:34:21] <wappyn> portal with reviews of board games, where you can create your profile, add games you played/own/wish to play, similar games to these, find people who played/wish/own a game at your city/x km range, find by genre etc.
[20:35:55] <wappyn> with django as back and React as front so I can do mobile in React Native too
[20:36:13] <wappyn> it seems donable in 6 months - year
[20:36:22] <wappyn> but can I do less and would it too be ok?
[20:36:36] <wappyn> I need a reference, of how actuall people portfolios looks like
[20:36:42] <wappyn> so I can figure out
[20:37:06] <wappyn> what is "good enough" size of project to get a job
[20:37:34] <wappyn> so I don't spend a year on building something too big
[20:37:51] <wappyn> not too mention I don't like front end
[20:38:07] <wappyn> and have too have other full time job at same time to not die
[20:38:17] <wappyn> have to have*

[20:42:51] <nbjoerg> I really don't think size matters all that much
[20:42:52] <doismellburning> wappyn: many of the best people I've hired have no open-source portfolio
[20:43:09] <nbjoerg> like I said, most recruiters won't look at the source code at all anyway
[20:43:32] <nbjoerg> if anything, they do because it looks like it could be interesting
[20:43:34] <doismellburning> wappyn: and I think places _requiring_ one, outside of some very specific niches, are making dubious decisions
[20:44:15] <doismellburning> wappyn: *but* I appreciate that, especially if you're light in demonstrable professional experience CV-wise, a portfolio can be a good way of demonstrating ability and skill
[20:45:30] <wappyn> I think that portfolio can be only way to make my CV looks at least decently
[20:45:44] <doismellburning> wappyn: In which case, from my perspective, I think I'd rather see one thing interesting and substantive than a lot of small shallow things
[20:46:01] <doismellburning> wappyn: but I don't think there's any kind of One True Answer here
[20:46:14] <doismellburning> wappyn: I'd be happy to take a look at your CV and offer feedback, if it would help?
[20:46:17] <wappyn> I mean I dropped university at 2nd year, then I got a job at company that hires 6 programmers and nobody heard of them...
[20:47:35] <wappyn> then 1 year gap than continues to now...
[20:47:43] <doismellburning> several of the best people I've hired never went to university at all (but again, I appreciate that having a demonstrable degree can be useful; *requiring* people to have them though is a bit ugh)
[20:50:50] <wappyn> popular opinion among IT related people I'm in contat now is "too many bootcamp graduates who belive they learned programming in 2 weeks made recruiters be pickier than ever and look at univeristy degree again"
[20:50:57] <wappyn> :D
[20:52:39] <nbjoerg> if I had to setup such a portfolio project, I would look for some publically available data set and figure out how to do some useful visualization on it, maybe with some PDF output etc
[20:53:06] <nbjoerg> shows a variety of technology off and could be used as a base for something economoically relevant
