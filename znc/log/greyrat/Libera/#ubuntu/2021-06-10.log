[00:04:00] <apb1963> tomreyn, Thank you.  Someone in the comments said: Try workaround:
[00:04:00] <apb1963> sudo apt purge ippusbxd  What do you think?
[00:04:55] <tomreyn> i couldn't tell whether ti would help. it's likely easily reverted if it doesn't
[00:04:59] <sarnold> it's a reasonable idea, ippusbxd is being replaced in the future due to problems..
[00:05:04] <apb1963> tomreyn, Actually... that bug and my complaint has at least 2 problems.  One is the repeated models.  The other is not printing.  Also auto-adds at random.  Auto-deletes.  Probably something else.
[00:05:06] <sarnold> it should be easy to undo if it doesn't help

[00:30:11] <sarnold> apb1963: maybe you could turn off the printer, check the dhcp settings on your router, and delete *all* instances of the printer in the dhcp page, turn it back on again, see what happens..

[00:48:40] <TJ-> dnssd = DNS Service Discovery aka multicast DNS; IPP = Internet Printer Protocol
[00:48:43] <apb1963> ipp is driverless.  I was using driverless.
[00:49:14] <apb1963> so really, ipp seems to be the best choice?  I notice socket embeds my IP address... which is dhcp provided.
[00:49:27] <TJ-> CUPS has been moving to IPP for a long while; other protocols are now deprecated
[00:49:39] <apb1963> didn't know that.  Interesting.
[00:49:48] <tomreyn> DrMax: actually not changed, i just read it wrong, oops
[00:49:57] <apb1963> so, I purged IPP... guess I need to reinstall it.
[00:50:38] <apb1963> Running a printer over DNS doesn't seem like the best idea to me.
[00:50:44] <TJ-> apb1963: yes; it can be fragile - I generally edit that to be the hostname.local the printer advertises over multicast-DNS which is accessible when libnss-mdns is installed, or, if you use systemd-resolved, libnss-resolve
[00:51:09] <TJ-> apb1963: For IPP to work the printer has to do multicast-DNS that's how the service discovery works
[00:51:24] <TJ-> printer advertises all its capabilities, how to connect to it, etc.
[00:51:50] <apb1963> TJ-, hmmm.  So IPP depends on DNS... fair enough I suppose.
[00:52:00] <jeremy31> TJ-: is that something that UFW will block?
[00:52:04] <tomreyn> DrMax: i think there was some change, though, whihc is that if you installed ubuntu 20.04.0 or .1, you'd get the vanilla kernel by default (but i think ubuntu-server would ask you about it), but if you installed 20.04.2 or newer you'd get -hwe (but i think ubuntu-server would ask you about it)

I am installing a custom WM setup via the Mini Iso on a laptop that has an Nvidia GPU. Which nvidia-driver-* package provides *just* the Nvidia drivers without necessarily pulling down GUI tools, the GNOME desktop environment, etc.? In other words,

[03:43:50] <ryu_> I was thinking about what browser should be shipped with Ubuntu.   Has anyone considered the Tor Browser taken off the Tor network being the default.  It is superior to Firefox and operates just like Firefox since it is based on Firefox.
[03:45:06] <src> ryu_: it's a bad default for most users and for most browsing so I doubt this will happen
[03:45:26] <src> I think there are privacy oriented distributions having tor browser as default (tails, maybe even qubes)
[03:46:30] <ryu_> src: Why is it bad for most users and browsing.  The problems to new users come from being on the Tor network.  This would be the browser off of the Tor network.
[03:47:00] <ryu_> It is just a customized Firefox at that point.

[04:01:33] <knaccc> hmm maybe i don't actually need postfix
[04:01:50] <sarnold> knaccc: postfix is probably a good choice for that; I use msmtp-mta for my workstation to send email to a specific work smtp server, but it *blocks* completely while sending the email, so when I send things in mutt, it'll just hang for ~two seconds while it negotiates TCP, then TLS, then sends, etc..
[04:02:18] <sarnold> knaccc: if the server isn't responsive, it'll block for a long time. it's slightly annoying for mutt but might be worse for cron
[04:02:37] <sarnold> knaccc: so having a real mta that can accept immediately and just try to send it over time can be pretty useful

[04:09:19] <sarnold> knaccc: yeah, most of them support most of the same arguments, so they can be used interchangably
[04:09:34] <knaccc> ahh, thanks for your guidance sarnold

[04:10:45] <knaccc> sarnold i think this explains why i needed to install postfix (in order to ensure a sendmail variant exists), but that i can receive email even though the postfix service is not running

[04:49:58] <knaccc> tomreyn ooh, yes dpkg-reconfigure postfix looks like it will help with the aliases db. it's asking me if i want to use procmail, which will force mail to root to go to a non-root user
[04:50:01] <sarnold> see what's what I thought, but I recently saw soemthing that didn't prompt during install but did if you ran dpkg-reconfigure manually .. so now I'm second guessing myself

[05:02:17] <knaccc> thanks so much for your help, tomreyn and sarnold

[05:06:12] <knaccc> tomreyn thanks, yes i have "default_transport = error" already - your version says "error:outside mail is not deliverable" <- does that just change the bounce error message, but achieve the same thing?
[05:06:33] <tomreyn> yes
[05:06:57] <knaccc> i think everything was mostly set up properly in main.cf by the dpkg-reconfigure postfix when i chose Local only
[05:07:15] <knaccc> i'd better now go and write this all down so i don't forget it next time
[05:07:18] <knaccc> thanks so much
[05:08:44] <tomreyn> you're welcome :)
[05:08:59] <tomreyn> and LOL postfix.org has no https yet
[05:09:05] <knaccc> haha
[05:09:31] <knaccc> the only one thing is that i don't see any "new mail for user" notification in the terminal
[05:09:35] <knaccc> i wonder what controls that
[05:09:55] <knaccc> it's probaly a blessing that i don't get that pollution
[05:10:40] <tomreyn> i think it's actually your login shell which checks for it
[05:11:44] <knaccc> tomreyn oh wow yes you're right - "MAILPATH - A colon-separated list of file names to be checked for mail"
[05:11:53] <knaccc> wow i'm learning so much
[05:12:05] <tomreyn> there should also be MAILCHECK
[05:12:14] <knaccc> yeah
[05:12:43] <knaccc> even though other distros would have done this all out of the box, i kinda like that i got to learn more about how this all works
[05:13:29] <knaccc> or maybe ubuntu would have done this stuff if i'd not have chosen a minimal isntall

[05:15:21] <tomreyn> but even for a server i assume you'd need to actively choose to install a mail server (but this can be done as part of the installation).
[05:15:39] <knaccc> yeah
[05:18:05] <tomreyn> learning to manage your own mail server is actually fun. it just gets tedious if you'll have to deal with large mail hosts which you / users of your server want to send mail to.

[06:01:46] <morgans> I understand mounting partitions or devices. I dont understand the outpoot and have no-meaning for the word loop. And snap is a woosh. (Yes I know it is some special system that replaced synaptic or close)
[06:03:09] <sarnold> morgans: the 'loopback interface' in networking is a special way that a computer can talk to itself, using the networking protocols, that's the 127.0.0.1 network on your computer
[06:03:27] <morgans> toddc, great I am making the startup disk. 1 down and 3 to go (one not even asked today)
[06:03:52] <sarnold> morgans: 'loop mounts' are similar, it's the computer 'talking to itself', sortof. there isn't a corresponding real physical device, so 'loop' was used in a similar sense

[10:55:22] <pikapika> Comrade, did you uninstall some vital packages mistakenly while trying to remove gnome?
[10:55:39] <pikapika> Or did you just want help with i3 specific stuff
[10:56:10] <polve> Hi. Today my laptop is having filesystem problems. After loggin in onto Gnome, it normally operates for about 2 minutes, then it somehow becomes read-only and everything stops working. Can't even sudo shutdown. I wanted to unseat and re-seat the nvme disk, but I seem unable to open the base...

[14:26:20] <mgedmin> I think that's for gtk 2.0?  most apps have migrated to gtk 3.0 years ago, and some are moving to gtk 4.0

[14:26:43] <mgedmin> things are different than they were 10 years ago

[14:27:06] <mgedmin> the default ubuntu theme is Yaru, and it's described in /usr/share/themes/Yaru/
[14:27:24] <mgedmin> I think the best thing to do is to create your own theme (i.e. copy it, rename, edit, then set it as default)
[14:27:41] <mgedmin> I think themes can also live in ~/.local/share/themes/?  so you shouldn't need to become root to tweak system files

[14:54:59] <Guest93> why the ubuntu installer doesn't create separate /home partition when using the entire desk option, also why it doesn't fully encrypt the entire desk including /boot since grub supports luks?
[14:56:21] *** Joins: dhil (~dhil@80.208.56.181)
[14:56:54] <ravage> Because the installer option clearly states that it will not do that
[14:57:10] <mgedmin> both are good questions; the answers are probably available in old ubunt mailing list posts
[14:57:19] <mgedmin> or maybe on https://discourse.ubuntu.com/
[14:57:19] <ravage> And for encryption you have to boot something to enter your password
[14:57:45] <Guest93> ravage thats the UEFI stub on the EFI parition that is not encrypted
[14:58:02] <ravage> You can look for something like systemd boot if you want everything encrypted
[14:58:13] <ravage> It's just not how the default installer does it
[14:58:53] <mgedmin> personally I'm more saddened by https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/1514120

[15:49:33] <DarkTrick> How do I uninstall software, if I don't know the package name?
[15:49:43] <mgedmin> DarkTrick: what do you know?
[15:49:50] <DarkTrick> name of the app
[15:50:08] <DarkTrick> mgedmin, ↑
[15:50:10] <mgedmin> you should be able to use Ubuntu Software (aka snap-store) to find the app by name and then uninstall it
[15:50:18] <DarkTrick> didnt work
[15:50:33] <DarkTrick> UB 20.10 btw
[15:50:39] <DarkTrick> XUB 20.10
[15:50:45] <mgedmin> this, of course, assumes that the app was installed via apt or via snap, and not by running a random installer script downloaded from the internet
[15:50:47] <DarkTrick> software center didnt find it
[15:50:57] <mgedmin> can we talk specifics?  what app is this?
[15:51:08] <DarkTrick> planmaker21
[15:51:10] <ogra> ... and how did you install it originally
[15:52:04] <DarkTrick> ogra, no idea maybe external deb file
[15:52:24] <ogra> so this is not your computer ?
[15:52:51] <Guest5> is "sudo apt-get upgrade" same as "sudo apt upgrade"? i think this post confused me previously: https://askubuntu.com/questions/999360/how-can-i-upgrade-my-eol-16-10-to-any-new-version
[15:53:05] <guiverc> DarkTrick, I'd use `whereis` to find it's location, the `file` to determine file type... You can use `dpkg -S` to see if file was installed from deb package.. but you'll already know if snap, or have a feeling if compiled from source etc..
[15:53:44] <ogra> Guest5, yes, roughly the same
[15:54:05] <ogra> (there are minor differences but they are ignorable in your case)
[15:54:11] <Guest5> also, editing sources.list to change "codename" is only done to upgrade to a newer release ahead of time? not once it's eol?
[15:54:29] <DarkTrick> guiverc, looks promising
[15:54:32] <ogra> you normally do not touch sources.list ...
[15:54:47] <ogra> do-release-upgrade does everything for non EOL releases
[15:54:48] <DarkTrick> dpkg -S found it, apt is removing
[15:55:43] <Guest5> ok so once it's EOL it's best to do a fresh install to get the new?
[15:56:16] <mgedmin> "best" depends on a bunch of factors
[15:56:20] <DarkTrick> Thank you for you quick help, mgedmin, ogra and guiverc!
[15:56:37] <mgedmin> you hit some bug that's preventing do-release-upgrade from working
[15:57:04] <mgedmin> you can either debug it and try to figure out why, or you can do a backup of your data, fresh install, and a restore of whatever files you want

[19:26:04] <tomreyn> your own, that of your trustable provider, or a trusted third party which provides it with little latency
[19:26:24] <Chunkyz-RPi> just don't use your ISP's dns.
[19:26:51] <tomreyn> a carte blanche for google dns certainly sounds wrong to me, too

[20:19:16] <jpmh> so, the next leg of my Pi Connection.   I have a PI connected to my Ubuntu laptop via a usb cable.  All works well and I can communicate, make ssh connections, etc.  The problem I have is that each time I connect the PI the Ubuntu system aloocates it a different MAC address and so the network interface name enx.... is different.  I am assuming that it is Ubuntu that is doing this.  Am I right, and how do I stop it doing this
[20:21:26] <oerheks> i wonder why that rasp pi would change mac, ubuntu does nto do this by default
[20:23:21] <jpmh> oerheks: well, is it the PI?  Surely since there really is no MAC address UBUNTU is generating one, no?

[20:24:26] <jpmh> oerheks: when I do an ip a, sure enough Ubuntu shows me the NEW mac address.  Surely this is the MAC address on the local machine and is somehow being randomized, no?
[20:25:32] <tomreyn> there's an option in network manager to have a randomized mac address
[20:25:38] <tomreyn> it's non-default, though
[20:26:28] <waveform> I would assume that's ubuntu (or more precisely network-manager) generating a MAC address for the virtual ethernet adapter on the USB port
[20:26:50] <tomreyn> actually it's for a fixed, fake, address, the setting is called  "cloned address"
[20:27:21] <tomreyn> why is it virtual?
[20:28:07] <tomreyn> is this a usb to ethernet dongle?
[20:28:23] <jpmh> waveform: and tomreyn so, what do I do to configure network manager not to do this?
[20:28:39] <jpmh> tomreyn: and what is your question on "why is it virtual"?

It's not that something deletes them frequently, they're deleted during the execution of the APT command which creates them.

[23:05:38] <chealer> I used to master APT but I don't know Ubuntu. I don't see anything in the APT configuration which would explain that. Does Ubuntu have a special behavior with regard to /var/cache/apt/archives/?

[23:13:10] <chealer> thanks tomreyn but surely autoclean alone wouldn't explain archives/ getting empty of any .deb, right?

[23:16:05] <ravage> If you use apt instead of apt-get, the default is not to store debs anywhere if the apt install is successful.
[23:16:07] <tomreyn> chealer: i've got a 18.04 desktop here with unattended-upgrades configured, but AutoCleanInterval is set to 0, so it doesn't happen. i only have very few packages in /var/cache/apt/archives/ - from the latest upgrade
[23:16:28] <chealer> It's really empty (it has only lock and partial/).

[23:17:15] <tomreyn> ravage: are those defaults for apt-get and apt documented anywhere that you know, other than "in code"?

[23:18:04] <tomreyn> IMO those two could benefit from a lot better documentation
