[01:15:15] <phogg> babyface: scp attempts to pass command strings along through snippets of shell code and other funky things.
[01:15:30] <phogg> babyface: it would be better if everyone stopped using it. It's just terribly convenient.

[01:17:21] <Pickchea> jim, you won't believe it but I just opened the the storage bay cover of the laptop and everything looked perfectly fine. HDD was fitting fair and square and was nicely plugged in. Out of desperation I took it out nonetheless, unplugged it, plugged it back in, put it back, and now the OS starts as usual. Lesson learned: when in doubt, just turn off/on or unplug/plug back in.
[01:17:28] <n4dir> i wonder more why the other apps work.
[01:17:44] <phogg> n4dir: I see quite a few hits for that on Google.
[01:18:01] <n4dir> phogg: tried them. To me they might be just as well in chinese
[01:18:53] <n4dir> phogg: i don't really need to solve the problem. In general the PC does the job. I would like to understand "what" is not working for those 2 or 3 (if you add glxinfo, which i only installed for troubleshooting)
[01:18:55] <jim> Pickchea, do you know if someone tried to unplug/plug in the drive?
[01:19:14] <n4dir> "it has something to do with graphics". That would already be a step for me.

[09:05:35] <Gustavo6046> my buildscript is very makeshifty https://github.com/Gustavo6046/MushMatch#mushmatch

[09:07:52] <Gustavo6046> ah
[09:08:02] <Gustavo6046> that build.sh/config.sh there are multiple steps involved
[09:08:16] <Gustavo6046> one of them generates the int file from the mustache template and the yml file, simple enough and easy to makefile

[09:09:12] <Gustavo6046> but then there is compiling the .u package, which requires Unreal Tournament, Wine, UMake.exe (which is just a thin wrapper around ucc, and is also GUI, blergh), and basically all the right paths
[09:09:18] *** Joins: upsala (~zcb@185.213.155.160)
[09:09:21] <Gustavo6046> that build.sh is honestly only meant to be run here
[09:09:56] <Gustavo6046> I haven't figured building it without requiring a copy of Unreal Tournament, which obviously is something I can't do in CI because it's, uh, a paid game
[09:10:30] <Gustavo6046> and also other people may have their UT set up in different folders and chances are this is not cloned as a subdir of their UnrealTournament directory (which is what build.sh expects)

[23:42:01] <KaigarU> No matter what I try with editing resolv.conf, connman always finds a way to resolv with my ISPs DNS.
[23:42:20] <ayecee> probably shouldn't be editing resolv.conf then
[23:42:34] <KaigarU> What should I edit?

[23:42:54] <CoderCop> KaigarU: Is this a systemd system? You generally don't edit resolv.conf directly if you use systemd
[23:42:55] <ayecee> tell me about what you were editing it for
[23:43:04] <Klinda> Ok so I do that CoderCop ?
[23:43:06] <Hash> So looks like resolv.conf is written everytime the system restarts or the service is restarted
[23:43:16] <Hash> This is because you are using systemd-resolvconf
[23:43:16] <KaigarU> CoderCop: It's openrc.
[23:43:28] <Hash> well that makes it easier

[23:45:07] <CoderCop> Klinda: It shouldn't be harmful to run it. If there are pending packages, they will be configured. If not, it shouldn't do anything.
[23:45:09] <ayecee> or from dhcp i guess

[23:45:17] <KaigarU> I try to set the dns through /var/lib/connman/settings, still no luck. The file isn't being overwritten iether, it's immutable.

[23:47:57] <KaigarU> I've tried that, when I restart the service connman just writes my ISPs dns in there.
[23:47:57] <Hash> If you set /etc/resolv.conf yourself, save, make sure immutable, then reboot what happens to resolv.conf? And if you resolve a domain, which dns does it use? use dig

[23:48:23] <Hash> You should consult their website
[23:48:28] <Hash> For a long time, we have used #lxde on freenode as our main channel for both user support and development. This is mainly due to legacy purposes as we split from the LXDE project.
[23:48:30] <ayecee> KaigarU: right. the goal is to make connman do something different.
[23:48:31] <Hash> Today though, we are moving to OFTC under a brand new name. #lxqt will be used for user support and general discussion while #lxqt-dev will be used for development-related discussion and commit notices.
[23:48:41] <Krail> LimeOn: web searches are fun and informative.  find out for yourself

[23:51:50] <KaigarU> I've been at this for a week now.. What's especially funny is that when I stop dnscrypt, domains stop being resolved as if it were functioning, but when I turn dnscrypt back on everything is resolving again, but I've confirmed it goes through my ISP.
[23:51:50] <Krail> msiism: thats where the human brain comes into play.  for those of us who have and know how to use them
