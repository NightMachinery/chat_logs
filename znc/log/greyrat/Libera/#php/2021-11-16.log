[00:33:54] <nitrospectide> If I have a multiple choice questionnaire, and it's 2 questions with 3 possible choices each, I calculate the possible number of different outcomes with 3 X 3, correct? What is that calculation called? I tried googling the calculation for combinations, or permutations, and they were all a lot more involved.
[00:35:37] <Albright_> So question A could have answers 1, 1 and 2, 1 and 3, etc? That'd be 2^3 = 8 combinations if you also count selecting none of them.
[00:36:16] <Albright_> I'm not sure what that's called either, though. Something to do with probability  I guess.
[00:36:42] <Albright_> That is, 8 combinations per question.
[00:45:30] <Sammitch> combinatorics
[00:46:15] <Sammitch> permutations
[00:47:33] <Albright_> Oh, I guess if each question can only have one possible answer, then A1 B1, A2 B2, etc, that would be 9 possibilities, yes
[00:47:51] <Albright_> between the two questions

[00:48:44] <Sammitch> unless you're trying to bruteforce an exam I'm not sure where this question is going
[00:52:16] <nitrospectide> Sammitch: I need to build a simple recommender with 2 or 3 questions, and maybe 3 possible answers to each question. In order to spit out a recommendation at the end, I have to have a way of matching up choice combos with recommendation outcomes.
[00:53:06] <__adrian> i don't see how knowing the number of possibilities is relevant?
[00:53:13] <__adrian> at least, not to your code?
[00:53:48] <__adrian> you need recommendations. index them by answer sets.
[00:54:13] <__adrian> any answer that doesn't have a recommendadtion... either do a best-fit, or have a default answer.
[00:59:27] *** Joins: sidj (~sidj@user/sidj)
[01:04:42] <nitrospectide> __adrian: I was going to have each possible combination, and let the subject matter expert fill in the recommendation for the key combinations. But I wanted to know how many of those there would be.
[01:05:21] <nitrospectide> If it goes to 5 questions and 5 choices on each, that's a fair bit more than 9.
[01:07:01] <nitrospectide> I'm still thinking about the best way to efficiently match choice combinations and recommendations. Thoughts?

[01:37:09] <Sammitch> nitrospectide: that's not exactly a sustainable plan since by the sixth question you'll have 729 possible outcomes.
[01:38:13] <Sammitch> I would imagine most "personailty tests" or similar have a set of categories and each answer has one or more scores relating to those categories and at the end the top N scored categories determines what pokemon you're most like or whatever
[01:39:01] <Sammitch> enumerating the full range of anything that grows exponentially is usually a fool's errand
[01:41:37] <nitrospectide> Sammitch: As long as the questionnaire is short, and the total possibilities come in at fewer than say, 50… I think it's doable. But I agree on how it gets out of hand quickly.
[01:43:36] <Sammitch> so no more than 3-4 questions, less if there are more than four options.

[14:14:31] <biberu> they are still rather long tbh

[17:52:27] <onichomp> no
[17:52:36] <skyroveRR> Hey guys, I've written a login page that sets sessions using session_start and there are several pages that have that function. One of the pages has images in .png format. I have added functionality to logout and that causes the browser to be redirected to the login page. In addition to that, I have added if isset to check for certain $_SESSION variables, and if they are not set, the user is redirected to the
[17:52:38] <skyroveRR> login page. The problem is, the png image files are still directly accessible by URL even if the user has not logged in. Can anyone suggest how I can cause the images to be only viewed when a user is logged in, and if anyone tries to access the image URL directly, he should be redirected to the login page?
[17:53:30] <biberu> onichomp: look up how that works, you can avoid requiring definitions manually with that
[17:53:54] <onichomp> im reading about it
[17:56:09] <onichomp> seems useful, but it still wouldnt solve my problem with paths

[17:58:37] <onichomp> i need it to basically include a file, and that file will render a <form action=?> where the ? would be pointing to the included file himself
[17:58:38] <Naktibalda> so you want __FILE__ without DOCUMENT_ROOT
[17:59:15] <Naktibalda> you should avoid using direct links to files, if it was included for display, you should include it for handling submission too
[17:59:54] <Naktibalda> another concept you have to read about is Front Controller - single entry point for all your code.
[18:01:03] <onichomp> the problem with using __FILE__ is that it generates, <form action="Z:\DEV\projects\fcns2\sys2\commonfuncs.php" method="post">

[18:04:46] <onichomp> if i dont specify the action, the action points to the file itself, i need the action to point to the file that was included, which is the one that is rendering the html for the action
[18:05:31] <biberu> that sounds unusual, and you've created a problem for yourself :)
[18:06:21] <onichomp> yeah, probably, i dunno what would be the usual way to do it
[18:06:24] <Naktibalda> how do you pick a file to include?
[18:07:54] <onichomp> well, i have ¨sys2/access/studentMain.php¨
[18:08:16] <onichomp> which ¨include_once '../commonfuncs.php';¨

[18:08:34] <onichomp> which is ¨sys2/commonfuncs.php¨
[18:09:12] <onichomp> and in ¨commonfuncs.php¨ theres a function called renderMainUI
[18:09:32] <onichomp> that i call from ¨sys2/access/studentMain.php¨
[18:10:07] <onichomp> and that ¨renderMainUI()¨ function echoes the html with the action
[18:12:23] <biberu> onichomp: if i understand you correctly the url in the browser should be studentMain.php then? if you just omit action from the form it'll submit to the same one, is that not what you want?
[18:13:03] <onichomp> no, i want it to point to ¨commonfuncs.php¨
[18:13:29] <biberu> why?
[18:13:55] <Naktibalda> that file should only contain functions, or it is badly named
[18:14:08] <onichomp> yeah, is badly named
[18:14:28] <onichomp> because it handles the procedures for logging out and other things
[18:14:44] <onichomp> i did that because at first i was putting everything in one folder
[18:15:27] <biberu> it's not just about the name though, it appears that you have an include (that is something optional btw) that a) handles a bunch of different responsibilities and b) isn't inert, generally a required file should just contain definitions that are then called from the code that needs them

[18:17:14] <onichomp> this is the pain im feeling right now
[18:17:15] <Naktibalda> you know where it is, just hardcode the path
[18:17:16] <biberu> the form handling for thise case should probably be somewhere close to studentMain.php
[18:18:50] <onichomp> i tried hardcoding it, but when i did that, if i click the submit, it doesnt do anything
[18:20:18] <onichomp> somehow ¨<form action="Z:\DEV\projects\fcns2\sys2\commonfuncs.php" method="post">¨ doesnt send my action to commonfuncs.php
[18:20:41] <biberu> ofc, that's a filesystem path
[18:20:50] <stenno> you have to send it to your webserver
[18:21:02] <Rockwood> biberu, o/
[18:21:27] <biberu> that's another potential issue with trying to derive the action attribute from the filename, it ties your structure on disk to the url paths
[18:22:41] <biberu> that might work for simple cases, but you'll probably soon run into cases where you need to e.g. have urls with fragments that aren't present on disk, have to localize them etc
[18:22:53] <Naktibalda> you want action="/sys2/commonfunctions.php"  right?
[18:23:47] <biberu> the browser isn't really accessing a file called studentMain.php directly either, the webserver just creates an illusion of it
[18:26:36] <biberu> hello Rockwood :)
[18:26:46] <onichomp> yeah, i want that action, and weirdly i just hardcoded it
[18:26:51] <onichomp> and it gives me The webpage at http://localhost:6101/sys2/commonfuncs.php might be temporarily down or it may have moved permanently to a new web address.
[18:27:17] <onichomp> which is weird as fuck because other files load correctly that way

[19:27:50] <znf> I'm trying to figure out if a client is doing something terribly wrong in his queries (and/or approach) or it's a Magento behaviour that is just completely whack
[19:28:19] <znf> They have a cron running every night that imports products from their ERP, and there's around ~47k products
[19:28:34] <znf> And for each one of them, they seem to create a temporary table, with a query like:
[19:28:36] <znf> CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE `tmp_select_hoUxHJQYut33OkkaRXBR5FWoaJ0KVpvD` (PRIMARY KEY(`url_rewrite_id`),INDEX `HASHKEY_ENTITY_STORE` USING HASH(`hash_key`),INDEX `ENTITY_STORE` USING HASH(`entity_id`,`store_id`)) ENGINE=`INNODB` IGNORE (SELECT `e`.*, CONCAT(e.store_id,'_', e.entity_id) AS `hash_key` FROM `url_rewrite` AS `e` WHERE (entity_type = 'product') AND (entity_id IN('1', '2', '4', '5',
[19:29:23] <znf> the entity_id... spans to around "current id" of the product being imported/updated
[19:29:36] <znf> Which means, as much as I can see, that they're literally creating around 47k temporary tables each night
[19:29:54] <znf> And the only difference between them seems to be 1 ID added to the end

[21:41:33] <skyroveRR> How do I turn http://server/images/puppies.png to http://server/image.php?id=puppies.png? The only way I can think of based on your comments is a rewrite rule on the server, and once that's done, PHP takes over.
[21:42:04] <__adrian> you don't
[21:42:14] <__adrian> you just write  http://server/image.php?id=puppies.png in the first place
[21:43:29] <skyroveRR> __adrian: that will point to http://server/images/puppies.png right? The user will then simply get the png file even if he's not logged in.
[21:43:47] <skyroveRR> __adrian: the whole point is to allow the user to view the png file ONLY when he's logged in.
[21:43:48] <__adrian> if he does, then your script def isn't working correctly

[21:44:13] <__adrian> your script ought to be checking auth, not assuming that anyone with the url is allowed
[21:45:02] <olle> skyroveRR: you have to put img outside web root
[21:45:55] <skyroveRR> __adrian: yeah, once the web server rewrites http://server/images/puppies.png to http://server/image.php?id=puppies.png, the image.php file will have check for the session for sure, else redirect to the login page. Is that what you mean?
[21:46:47] <__adrian> i only meant that if asking for  http://server/image.php?id=puppies.png  "bypasses" authorization, then your authorization process is broken in the first place
[21:46:58] <skyroveRR> Oh.
[21:47:44] <__adrian> also note you don't need rewrite for this. just route that whole directory to your image auth script.
[21:47:48] <skyroveRR> But, if the user directly accesses http://server/images/puppies.png, I want to prevent that and I wnat him to authenticate. So in this case, a rewrite on the server is required right?
[21:48:10] <__adrian> is /images/puppies.png the actual image file?
[21:48:14] <skyroveRR> Yes.
[21:48:34] <__adrian> then see olle's comment. auth doesn't matter if you're leaving the file in a public accessible directory anyway.
[21:48:55] <__adrian> put it outside the web root, or configure apache to NOT serve files from that directory.

[21:55:11] <skyroveRR> Which is sucky. I like PHP's sessions. Vastly more configurable.

[22:04:01] <skyroveRR> __adrian: erm... so basically what you guys mean to say is, it's solvable by implementing basic authentication by making the directory private, right?
[22:04:19] <__adrian> yes
[22:04:25] <skyroveRR> Even though that authentication is stateless.
[22:05:13] <__adrian> the browser ought to keep sending the header.
[22:05:32] <__adrian> unless images are on a different domain or something
[22:11:42] <skyroveRR> __adrian: ok, so now here's the thing: user opens http://server/login.php, which redirects to http://server/success.php, and http://server/success.php has http://server/priv/puppies.png as an href. If I were to do basic auth for http://server/priv , meaning I have to supply username and password for accessing the priv directory, how will the browser then interact with that directory? Will it throw that basic
[22:11:45] <skyroveRR> authentication prompt or can I somehow tell nginx to not throw the basic authentication prompt because the user is already authenticated and in session?
[22:13:10] <skyroveRR> Also, "the browser ought to keep sending the header"..... umm... that'll require some googling.
[22:15:06] <__adrian> once you send credentials and they work, the browser continues to send them.
[22:16:03] <__adrian> if you're not using basic/digest for the rest of the site, i think there's a way to tell the browser to set the auth header but i'm not sure on that... and having trouble googling it
