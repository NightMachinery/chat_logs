[00:12:12] <shgvbvri> I've been building "+y/"+p muscle memory, kinda annoying but I see it's worth it
[00:12:32] <shgvbvri> precision is nice
[00:12:36] <hajonnes> zeraphel, why would gvim work better or is it just that it might be compiled with + clipboard?
[00:14:02] <hajonnes> I have never tried neovim should I use it instead? pros/con?
[00:14:23] <shgvbvri> it has some pros over clipboard behavior iirc
[00:15:07] <shgvbvri> but there's so much stuff now in nvim 0.5 that goes beyond what vim offers, that's better you check it up
[00:15:20] <shgvbvri> yourself
[00:16:38] <mort> hajonnes: the vim build you have might be one which isn't built to be linked against the X11 libraries. Installing gvim might work because the version of the `vim` program is probably built against the X11 libraries
[00:16:39] <hajonnes> ok.
[00:17:01] <mort> but first you can check if you actually have the `vim` package installed or if you have something like `vim-nox`
[00:17:47] <shgvbvri> hajonnes: nvim vs vim :h clipboard -> https://i.imgur.com/5qz4JPf.png
[00:17:47] <hajonnes> I used "sudo apt install vim" there where nox and gtk versions but I ran with the vanilla one.

[00:28:20] <shgvbvri> hajonnes: notice though, vim terminal can have clipboard working, the thing is, distros provide many kinds of vim packages, each which a given set of build flags ON. So by installing something with gvim from your distro, you'll get the vim terminal that have clipboard working.
[00:28:52] <shgvbvri> this is less error prone with neovim

[04:08:22] <dre> does anyone know in FZF, when you open up a certain search (ie :Files) - is it possible to remap " " to "/" 
[04:09:12] <dre> ie: only when Files is open? because it doesn't like fuzzyfinding paths with space, but I'd write things like "dir1 dir2 dir3 file.py"
[04:10:42] <shgvbvri> if Files is a buffer of a given type, you can do a buffer local map
[04:10:57] <nickspoon> I think it's a terminal isn't it?
[04:11:21] <shgvbvri> if it's a tmux pane or something, guess we vimmers, can't help
[04:11:52] <nickspoon> I think it's a vim/neovim terminal split
[04:12:14] <nickspoon> or floating window
[04:13:01] <dre> floating window
[04:13:42] <dre> it seems to map it's own bindings internally ( for selection and things) - perhaps I might have to just rip into it a bit. 
[04:13:51] <dre> just wondering if anyone had experience. Cheers anywayt
[04:14:52] <shgvbvri> dre: in such cases I always look up whether the plugin sets a buftype or filetype of such floats, in general they do, then you can have buf/ft specific stuff for them.
[04:15:35] <shgvbvri> I do that after checking whether their docs provide the customization themselves

[08:06:32] <herjazz> but that seems to take ranges as opposed to patterns
[08:08:34] <herjazz> maybe using marks I guess
[08:08:49] <herjazz> as part of a macro
[08:11:40] <nickspoon> herjazz: ranges can use patterns

[08:12:12] <herjazz> interesting. maybe this is a solution to my issues
[08:12:15] <herjazz> https://vi.stackexchange.com/q/5298/26671
[08:12:35] <nickspoon> but :move doesn't move _to_ a range, it moves a range of lines
[08:13:19] <herjazz> Yeah that'S fine
[08:13:32] <herjazz> I want to move a line to a certain point in the file
[08:13:51] <herjazz> So I just need it to find the relevant line
[08:13:58] <herjazz> rather than a range
[08:14:20] <herjazz> Earlier I meant that :move was modified by a range
[08:15:09] <herjazz> but that point in the file has to be located by a search
[08:15:48] <herjazz> Maybe I do a search leave a mark at the poit and :move the line to the mark?
[08:15:51] <herjazz> point
[08:16:08] <nickspoon> Another way to go is to _first_ navigate to the line you want to move _to_, and then use something clever to move lines there. I have a mapping that I think I got from romainl originally that does this
[08:16:39] <herjazz> right
[08:17:04] <nickspoon> So from the location I want to move or copy lines to, I search /whatever and use <C-g> to move through results to get the right one, then hit <space><space>m to copy that searched line here

[08:22:33] <herjazz> ahh ok. That's kind of the reverse of what I want to do. Basically I'm browsing a file for something I want to use (so I can't search for that). Once I find it I want to move that to the first line that matches my pattern (in this case the first commented line in my file).
[08:23:36] <herjazz> The thing I'm looking for is anything that catches my fancy so my def'n it isn't searchable. but the location I want to send it to is.
[08:24:17] <nova> herjazz, I think :move 0/SearchMe/-  works

[08:27:00] <herjazz> That worked. Slight need to readjust the search term.
[08:27:35] <herjazz> Thanks both for the help and thanks nickspoon for that vpaste. Those mappings will be useful.
[08:29:04] <herjazz> Now got to build the rest of the macro but that is more straightforward.
[08:29:30] <herjazz> oh about that, as the final step in the macro I want the cursor to return to the line I copied.
[08:29:37] <nickspoon> ``
[08:29:43] <herjazz> cheers
[08:30:33] <herjazz> hmm that doesn't seem to return me to the line though
[08:30:48] <nickspoon> Actually :copy and :move don't appear to be jumps
[08:30:51] <herjazz> throws me to an earlier location (as does CTRL-o)
[08:30:54] <herjazz> yup
[08:31:02] <nickspoon> So manually add the current location to the jumplist first
[08:31:10] <nickspoon> m`
[08:32:00] <herjazz> that does the trick
[08:35:16] <nova> herjazz, or  let view = winsaveview()  ...  call winrestview(view)
[08:36:01] <nickspoon> yeah that's my preference too, as it doesn't move the window position, but it's a bit wordier, use it in a function, not a macro
[08:36:54] <herjazz> Exactly, I wasn't aware of winsaveview() though, but for this macro the mark trick is fine and I think I probably want to move the window position in this case
[08:37:04] <nova> of course not in macro, but function always preferred for anything going into vimrc / .vim/plugin / etc
[08:37:10] <herjazz> but thanks again.

[16:12:52] <habamax> nova, now if there was a way to do a proper docx out of tex
[16:13:10] <habamax> maybe there is, google fu should be used then
[16:13:34] <habamax> duckduckgo-fu failed me
[16:13:37] <nova> cadmio, if you can, I recommend installing gvim on your system (sometimes called vim-gtk). tl;dr it installs a slightly larger binary at /usr/bin/vim (for example) and symlinks /usr/bin/gvim to it, and also note that if you have firefox or any other gtk2/3 package, then your package manager won't pull in any other dependencies. But installing gvim gives you extra support (compiled with additional,
[16:13:39] <nova> useful options for the standard vim experience).
[16:15:11] <nova> habamax, I mean you can use pandoc. pandoc foo.tex -o foo.docx
[16:15:44] <habamax> I know, I use it for asciidoc -> docx, but it is super limited
