[00:10:43] <skyfaller> hi folks, what do you think is the best forum for long detailed CSS questions? I posted on the css subReddit and Stack Overflow to deafening silence. I got one downvote on Reddit, that's it :/
[00:12:02] <AMcBain> It could be you're asking the wrong question(s) or not providing enough information if you're looking for help. Additionally if what you're asking amounts to "doing it for you" many don't like to get into that if they feel it is.
[00:12:57] <AMcBain> We certainly welcome questions here, but I'd ask them one at a time and wait for an answer. If you get any feedback, definitely pay attention to it.
[00:13:57] <skyfaller> well, here's my question on Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69180018/is-it-possible-to-test-for-support-for-marker-content-using-supports
[00:16:02] <AMcBain> Uhhh, you only asked 4 hours ago? I mean that's not that long for asynchronous platforms.
[00:16:59] <skyfaller> I asked on Reddit yesterday. I'm mostly asking if there is some other place that would be better
[00:19:08] <skyfaller> also in other news, is there a way to test for the content property with a selector using the ::marker pseudo-element using @supports? :)
[00:24:11] <AMcBain> Well you can test for selectors with @supports if the browser supports CSS Level 4 for that part.
[00:24:24] <AMcBain> @supports selector(...) { ... }
[00:24:55] <AMcBain> but there's no way to really test a property within a selector via @supports.
[00:25:29] <AMcBain> because a separate test for selector(::marker) and content: ''; might pass independently.
[00:25:58] <skyfaller> are there any proposals that might solve this situation in the future?
[00:26:29] <skyfaller> and in the present, what would you do in my situation?
[00:27:12] <matsaman> what situation?
[00:28:47] <AMcBain> It's possible @supports will be expanded in the future, but unless it's added to Level 4 for that, it's not going to happen until some future one, so it might be a while.
[00:28:52] <AMcBain> and even then, it doesn't help you now.
[00:29:02] <AMcBain> You might need some sort of JS solution for detection here.
[00:29:18] <skyfaller> matsaman: I linked a long explanation, but basically WebKit supports ::marker but not the content property within it, so I want to display different CSS to WebKit and browsers like it.
[00:30:03] <matsaman> why not simply use a single implementation catering to the lowest common denominator
[00:30:45] <matsaman> anyway, there's undoubtedly _something_ "webkit" doesn't support that you can use for an @supports filter
[00:31:13] <hassoon> skyfaller: irc is the best live forum
[00:31:30] <skyfaller> the lowest common denominator appears to be ::before, and there appears to be (1) an accessibility problem with it, and (2) it messes up indentation so it looks bad
[00:31:34] <hassoon> skyfaller: #web and #css should be enough
[00:33:50] <skyfaller> https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=204163#c9
[00:50:18] <skyfaller> hassoon: and I am currently just testing for webkit browsers using -webkit-hyphens: auto, this works fine for now but if WebKit fixes this in the future then I'll need to find a way to detect just the versions of WebKit that have/haven't fixed the problem.
[00:52:38] <hassoon> skyfaller: i see

[00:56:33] <matsaman> well if they "fix" that in the future, might they also fix the ::marker/content issue?
[00:56:46] <matsaman> you can't really future proof with web browers, things always change & get broken
[00:56:51] <matsaman> even if it happens less amazingly than it did in the past
[00:57:26] <hassoon> skyfaller: doesn't matter
[00:58:35] <skyfaller> well, the magic of @supports is that you shouldn't need to test for specific browsers, browsers should sort themselves based on whether they support the features you're trying to use, should reduce your maintenance burden. It just doesn't work when @supports doesn't let you test directly for the thing you need to test for
[00:58:52] <hassoon> skyfaller: well meh, why are you into that anyway ?
[00:59:09] <hassoon> skyfaller: wait lemme read your question
[00:59:13] <hassoon> wasn't follwing up very well
[01:01:27] <hassoon> skyfaller: sure it's doable using ::before, with the right alignement
[01:01:35] <hassoon> skyfaller: as for accessibility ? not sure
[01:01:38] <hassoon> do you need that ?
[01:01:40] <hassoon> is that necessary ?

[01:16:46] <skyfaller> I tried a negative margin on the ::before, but it's not consistent across indentation levels

[02:55:42] <hassoon> skyfaller: here, have a look https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/399
[02:57:10] <skyfaller> oh wow, looks like it works! Can you explain a little about what you did?
[02:59:26] <skyfaller> also, it looks like you needed 3 levels of counters instead of just one... Is there any way around that? What happens if we want another level?
[03:00:02] <hassoon> skyfaller: just made it cleaner by differenciating between simple lists without children, and composed lists with nested lists
[03:00:26] <hassoon> skyfaller: sure, you need to know the level you're up to beforehand
[03:00:37] <hassoon> skyfaller: and prepare the right counters accordingly
[03:00:40] <hassoon> that's my approach
[03:00:55] <hassoon> you have like 5-level list ? prepare 5 counters
[03:01:13] <hassoon> and differenciate between simple lists and lists with child lists
[03:01:27] <hassoon> and.. do wrap text in spans, don't keep text floating around without a container
[03:01:40] <hassoon> otherwise you won't be able to target it with css
[03:02:09] <skyfaller> the <li> isn't enough of a container? Is it because we're adding the ::before in front of it?
[03:02:17] <hassoon> skyfaller: what do you mean by just one? do you intend to process all lists with the right counters using one sole level of counters ?
[03:02:41] <hassoon> skyfaller: nah the idea here is to make the li a flex container, and wrap the text in a span so that you can give it flex-grow:1
[03:02:42] <skyfaller> if you look at my original code, we're getting the correct numbering without defining multiple counters
[03:03:02] <hassoon> in other words, you stretch the text, and the ::before just sticks to the right, with no additional space for it
[03:03:53] <hassoon> skyfaller: it makes more sense if you just prepare the counters and know the level of nesting of your lists from the beginning
[03:04:14] <hassoon> otherwise if you want to make it completely automatic? you might want to switch to the superpower of javascript
[03:05:22] <skyfaller> well, thank you for your efforts, I really appreciate you showing me an example that works
[03:05:37] <hassoon> skyfaller: glad that helped you, go on and use it !
[03:07:27] <skyfaller> is there no way to detect in CSS whether an <li> has children without an HTML class?
[03:08:29] <hassoon> skyfaller: there is :has() but it's in css4 and not supported yet, any soon
[03:08:42] *** Joins: mukul (~mukul@c-24-6-109-135.hsd1.ca.comcast.net)
[03:09:01] <skyfaller> ah, I see, thank you
[03:09:35] <skyfaller> wow that looks like it will be really useful when it arrives
[03:09:38] <hassoon> skyfaller: there is :empty as well, but it means a completely empty element, as in <li></li>
[03:10:02] <skyfaller> ah yes, not quite what we want here
[03:11:23] <hassoon> skyfaller: meh you should know your lists and how deep they can get you know.. ;)
[03:17:06] <hassoon> skyfaller: ah you also use the attr() approach
[03:17:26] <hassoon> skyfaller: just add e.g a data-attribute in your li tag containing the depth number
[03:17:41] <skyfaller> oh interesting
[03:18:27] <skyfaller> I didn't know that worked in CSS
[03:18:53] <hassoon> skyfaller: ya you wire the content in ::before to a data-attribute
[03:18:59] <hassoon> it's pretty supported
[03:19:46] <hassoon> skyfaller: e.g content: attr(data-rank-parent)"."attr(data-rank)"."
[03:19:49] <skyfaller> yeah, even in ie11 according to CanIUse
[03:20:26] <hassoon> skyfaller: or even content:attr(data-rank-parent-parent)"."attr(data-rank-parent)"."attr(data-rank)"." for our 3-levels list
[03:21:11] <skyfaller> how do you think that compares to classes?
[03:21:22] <hassoon> skyfaller: like that you just render the html part from your server side, and prepare the ranks/depths in your html attributes, then css just takes care about wiring those with the pseudo elements
[03:21:39] <hassoon> * takes care of *
[03:22:09] <hassoon> skyfaller: what ? what about classes ?
[03:22:47] <skyfaller> erm, well, your example doesn't use data attributes. What would be the advantage of that approach over what you've done in this fiddle?
[03:26:04] <hassoon> skyfaller: you prepare the list numbers in the html attributes, then render them with css inside the ::before elements, isn't that more automatic for you ? imagine you're rendering complex nested lists, you just need to output the list numbers in html attributes in your server side language, and that can be done easily automatically using loops and similar data processing technics, then finally css just
[03:26:10] <hassoon> renders those in the pseudo-elements
[03:27:35] <hassoon> skyfaller: meh you can just echo print the list numbers in the HTML DOM itself using your server side language, and just without css work too :p
[03:27:42] <skyfaller> lol
[03:28:02] <hassoon> skyfaller: in that case css will just render the list numbers in a better way
[03:28:38] <skyfaller> well, thank you again, this has been very educational
[03:28:58] <hassoon> skyfaller: yw, glad it was helpful
[03:29:32] <skyfaller> I may be back to ask you more about how your example works, I barely understand flexbox for example

[03:33:23] <skyfaller> I know what it is, that doesn't mean I understand it fully :)

[21:19:09] <thykka> fweht, because `fixed` is always relative to viewport, whereas `absolute` is relative to it's offset parent
[21:19:53] <thykka> you have `fixed` on both divs, then `fixed` again in one of the <img>s, not sure what the aim is
[21:20:23] <fweht> thykka: just encountered the behaviour and dont understand it, i know how to fix it of course but i want to understand whats going on exactly
[21:21:44] <fweht> in the fixed case i think the element can find any ancestor with set width so it ignores the `width: 100%` assignment  and behaves like `width: auto`
[21:21:44] *** Quits: drej (~drej@user/drej) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[21:22:18] <fweht> but in the absolute case there is no ancestor with set width either, yet for some reason `width: 100%` computes to `0` as far as i can see
[21:27:06] <hassoon> fweht: the parent of the div with position:absolute needs to have a width/height for the image to be rendered
[21:27:44] <fweht> hassoon: ok interesting, so thats an explicit difference in absolute and fixed?
[21:28:06] <fweht> i also saw that it only works with images this way, with divs i see no difference between the two
[21:28:48] <hassoon> fweht: the fixed-positioned element is not related to any ancestor/parent, it's related to the global viewport at whole, bit the absolute-positioned element always needs a parent with defined dimensions
[21:30:43] <fweht> hassoon: but why isnt the `100%` taken from the global viewport then and the image rendered full screen width?
[21:32:55] <fweht> and shouldnt this https://play.tailwindcss.com/nVz69YzyhM give the same result as when the absolute positioned container is absent?  as it only passes through the width from its parent?

[21:38:50] <thykka> the outermost div.fixed has no size, and it becomes the inner div.absolute's offset parent, of which 100% is 0px
[21:39:50] <thykka> same doesn't apply when the inner div is also .fixed, because then it's offset parent is the viewport, and the outer .fixed's zero-width doesn't matter
[21:41:51] <thykka> does that make sense, fweht?

[21:46:10] <thykka> FlorianBad, not with CSS, I guess it would be somewhat possible with javascript trickery
[21:47:34] <FlorianBad> ok :( now I need that for a bold version of a font, which is a different font file. If I use `font-weight: bold`  instead, would that still affect the em?

[21:48:52] <fweht> thykka: it makes sense, but im still a bit confused.  i guess i dont really understand how css evaluates percentages.  my assumption was it looks at the offset parent, if it has no set width it looks at the offset parent of the offset parent, but does it always return some value?  does it always end up at viewport, if no other ancestor has a width?

[21:56:24] <fweht> fwiw i posted it on SO
[21:58:08] <thykka> FlorianBad, what is your aim? why does the changing size matter?
[21:58:30] <FlorianBad> thykka: because all my sizes are in em
[21:59:35] <thykka> what does that have to do with it?
[22:00:45] <thykka> different fonts may appear at different dimensions, because the font files have a say on their size too. It's possible to make a font that appears really tiny at 16px.
[22:01:22] <thykka> there's not much that can be done about this in CSS, but it seems that you have a problem you need to fix, and this is how you thought it could be fixed? tell us about the problem, maybe there's another way
[22:02:58] <FlorianBad> yeah, that's fine I'll just change the font with a child that display the text only while all the parents are unaffected by the font-family

[22:55:00] <plocket> I’ve got an absolutely positioned before pseudo element containing an image and it doesn’t seem to be translateing by -50% appropriately, even though all the others are behaving.

[23:15:18] <thykka> plocket, the active svg is wider than notavailableyet.svg
[23:15:30] <jiffe> wrt http://nsab.us/public/test.html why is there padding on the top and bottom of the button images?  I'm having problems vertically centering because of that I think
[23:24:26] <thykka> jiffe, well, it's a font, not an image with a tight bounding box. The font metrics are adding space, especially when scaled up with a large font-size. If you want to do it like this, the easy fix is to use display: block; on the <i>s
[23:24:36] <plocket> thykka, I see that, yeah. Why is it further to the right, though? It's starting at the same position on the left and then it's translating -50%. Translating should be relative to the origin of the element itself, so it should still end up centered there.
[23:25:35] <jiffe> thykka: if I put a background on the <i> it doesn't seem to be tied to the font image
[23:27:01] <jiffe> and chrome dev tools confirm the size of the <i> to not include that extra space
[23:28:01] <plocket> And, from what I understand, translation is relative to the width of the element itself as well.
[23:28:44] <thykka> plocket, hmm yeah.
[23:28:56] <thykka> plocket, could you use the svgs as background-images instead?
[23:29:31] <plocket> I tried, but then they get cut off by the parent element. They need to be halfway out.
[23:29:45] <plocket> ^ thykka
[23:30:00] <thykka> the background image can be scaled so that it doesn't crop
[23:30:17] <thykka> scaled and positioned in the middle of the pseudo-element
[23:30:29] <plocket> I need it to be halfway out so that it overlaps the left border of the parent.
[23:30:40] <plocket> So that there's the line going halfway through all the circles
[23:32:14] <plocket> ^thykka
[23:32:19] <plocket> ^ thykka
[23:32:53] <plocket> There are lots of hacks I could do to fix it, but I really want to understand what's going on.
[23:33:28] <jiffe> changing the line-height FA was setting from 1 to 1.25 seems to work and scale too
[23:40:10] <thykka> plocket, i'm thinking the problem might lie within using content property with url() for an image. It acts like an <img> element within the pseudo-element, so the styles for the pseudo don't directly effect the <img> within. I guess that's why you used scale() instead of setting the width & height directly?
[23:42:01] <plocket> Weird. Can't remember my reasoning at the time with scale, but maybe that was it. `translate` works differently for <img>s?
[23:42:06] <plocket> ^ thykka
[23:42:31] <thykka> no, but you're translating the pseudo-element, which contains the image
[23:42:41] <thykka> eh, idk
[23:43:07] <thykka> either way, it shouldn't be this tricky to begin with
[23:44:41] <plocket> You mean I shouldn't be building it this way? I agree it's not ideal, but all I can control is the css
[23:44:58] <plocket> I mean that I can't change the html, thykka
[23:45:16] <thykka> no I mean it can be achieved in CSS way easier
[23:46:54] <plocket> Awesome! What's another way, thykka?
[23:47:07] <plocket> Though someday I really do want to understand what's happening here.
