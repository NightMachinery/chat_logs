[00:16:08] <phryk> are the pandora papers public?
[00:18:28] <ThePendulum> I think they're still in the box
[00:22:18] <phryk> aw, I'd really like for the ICIJ to publish their leaks as torrents as a matter of principle.^^
[00:22:42] <ThePendulum> I have no idea btw, lol, sorry

[00:24:47] <evilgohan2> gotta be honest...
[00:24:58] <evilgohan2> when I saw that, my only reaction was a giant "meh"
[00:25:05] <evilgohan2> Panama papers didn't result in anything
[00:25:15] <evilgohan2> (save for getting a journalist killed)
[00:25:16] <evilgohan2> These likely won't either.
[00:25:34] <evilgohan2> I mean, please, prove me wrong.
[00:25:35] <ThePendulum> I thought most of it was frowned upon but technically legal?
[00:25:37] <evilgohan2> But I doubt it.
[00:25:56] <evilgohan2> Is that the case? I recall reading some stuff about money laundering.
[00:26:04] <NeoThermic> <ThePendulum> I thought most of it was frowned upon but technically legal? <-- basically for a lot of it

[00:31:25] <skye0_mobile> yeah. bought a couple of double slit maxi skirts, figuring out how to wear them since i'm gonna wear them instead of getting drunk on halloween in case i have disagreements with parents
[00:31:53] <skye0_mobile> i don't really do anything special about it then, and it's just common sense to not do trick or treating while the pandemic's still a thing but i don't want people to be discouraged from celebrating halloween
[00:37:24] <phryk> skye0_mobile: "capitalism is a fuck. governments are a fuck. civilization is a fuck" <- full ACK on that.
[00:42:15] <skye0_mobile> i'd argue that people had to find excuses to oppress others when society became complex enough to the point they developed into civilizations (i.e. when people became more specialized with their labor or something)
[00:42:47] <evilgohan2> oh
[00:43:03] <evilgohan2> but if I choose to not give christmas gifts because I don't wanna support that capitalist holiday
[00:43:12] <evilgohan2> I'm a bad family member.
[00:44:14] <skye0_mobile> i can't say as someone who hasn't been giving gifts very much i have to admit

[21:19:19] <evilgohan2> or 8TB to hit $119 again.
[21:19:27] <evilgohan2> I got an 8 bay NAS that needs to be filled.

[22:47:31] <rmmh> 8 bay NAS is 6+2?
[22:49:24] <evilgohan2> for RAID6
[22:49:51] <cirdan> i have an 8 drive raidz1
[22:50:04] <evilgohan2> It'll probably end up being 5+2 for me since the current only drive in there is a small SSD that came with it when I bought it from a guy on Craigslist.
[22:50:04] <rmmh> I see you like living dangerously
[22:50:30] <evilgohan2> I have an 8 drive Storage Space single parity because Storage Spaces is stupid :(
[22:50:45] <cirdan> raid isn't a backup

[22:51:08] <cirdan> it's only a delay to restoring from backup
[22:51:22] <cirdan> but my backups are all out of date i should run another

[22:53:11] <evilgohan2> 8x4TB = 32TB. RAID1 = 28TB. RAID2 = 24TB. Storage Spaces Dual Parity = 18TB.
[22:53:19] <evilgohan2> Not an exaggeration.
[22:53:32] <evilgohan2> because Storage Spaces is dumb and creates THREE parity layers.
[22:53:39] <evilgohan2> and it's SLOW
[22:54:50] <rmmh> ...why not spend a bit more and manage a little better than 18TB for 8 drives
[22:55:55] <evilgohan2> Personally, I won't be buying 18TB. More likely 14TB.
[22:56:10] <cirdan> i <3 my 18s but they are geting full
[22:58:22] <ThePendulum> got 7,07 GiB free on my NAS \o/
