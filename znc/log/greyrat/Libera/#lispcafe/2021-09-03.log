[00:10:26] <Jacobis9000> I am excited guys!
[00:10:42] <Jacobis9000> just have to install quicklisp now
[00:13:46] <Jacobis9000> hmm so I tried to get it to run (* 1 4) it threw an error and then I couldn't work out how to get back to the original screen I was on. 
[00:16:24] <lotuseater> you mean signaled an error ;)
[00:16:42] <lotuseater> what did it say?
[00:16:51] <Jacobis9000> I don't know
[00:17:03] <Jacobis9000> I ended up with only one window and then I exited emacs
[00:17:05] <lotuseater> so try again
[00:17:18] <Jacobis9000> I need to learn all the commands for this before I try to use it
[00:17:35] <lotuseater> noooo
[00:18:07] <lotuseater> that would be too much and overwhelming and keep you away from the real learning, step by step

[03:14:58] <hayley> That could work, sure.
[03:21:10] <hayley> It doesn't make sense as x86-64 instructions. Why would loading a static slot emit a CALL and MOVABS?
[03:21:53] <White_Flame> the call would be for slowpath, probably
[03:22:19] <White_Flame> there's pseudocode for the barrier at the end of this: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221032806_C4_The_Continuously_Concurrent_Compacting_Collector
[03:22:21] -ixelp- (PDF) C4: The Continuously Concurrent Compacting Collector
[03:22:24] <hayley> Rather the CALL was the first instruction, so it would be a strange slow-path.
[03:22:28] <White_Flame> ah
[03:22:45] <White_Flame> well, if it were a call, it'd always be in cache :-P
[03:23:43] <White_Flame> so 2 bitvalue checks on the reference (which might be collapsed into a single instruction, depending on how clever they are?) and probably a conditional jump to a slow path

[07:21:40] * hayley reads https://stuff-gil-says.blogspot.com/2014/10/what-sort-of-allocation-rates-can.html trying to figure out how thread local heaps skew things
[07:22:57] <hayley> If everything lands in cache, your primary memory bandwidth is less interesting, no?
[07:25:36] <gilberth> Isn't that what caches are for?
[07:26:19] <hayley> Right.
[07:27:01] <gilberth> And isn't it that PCs boot without the external memory even set up and functional?
[07:27:39] <hayley> Yes.
[07:28:52] <dave0> i remember when memory was faster than cpus and branches were faster than arithmetic :-p
[07:30:17] * hayley reads the mechanical-sympathy thread and wonders if using a SATB concurrent mark is a good idea. Well, using the read barrier as described is much worse...
[07:32:42] <hayley> Still thinking about my little hypothesis though. After loading an immediate boxed value, we tend to do a type test. After loading a heap allocated value, we tend to read a slot. So the "immediate value" test can be folded, and we're basically prefetching w.r.t the first few slots of a heap object.
[07:38:11] * hayley finds 7.2GB/s or so of "allocation" in a L2 cache-sized "nursery"?  
[07:39:49] <hayley> Then 9GB/s on L3, though I only have one core running this crap...and then a linear slowdown when I blow out L3? That looks wrong. Oh well.
[07:49:55] <gilberth> dave0: Was memory ever really faster than CPUs?
[07:50:17] <White_Flame> certainly
[07:50:31] <White_Flame> at least for the consumer market
[07:50:50] <White_Flame> consider the depth of operation that a CPU has to do vs a RAM Chip
[07:51:15] <dave0> gilberth: i think so!
[07:51:17] <White_Flame> the dram has always had a fixed overhead for its buffer charge time, and that's pretty much stayed the same
[07:51:33] <White_Flame> and that fixed overhead was pretty nominal back then.  nowaday's it's major
[07:51:35] <gilberth> Sure, perhaps my brain is too tainted thinking in RISC pipelines. Especially the latter.
[07:51:47] <White_Flame> -'
[07:51:49] <dave0> i read that 6502 does a memory access every cycle, but it takes 4 cycles per instruction
[07:52:17] <White_Flame> it does do a memory bus event every cycle. Average cpi is 3 cycles, while the shortest are 2 cycles
[07:52:38] <White_Flame> some of the bus cycles are ignored (dummy reads), but it's still pretty dense
[07:52:52] <White_Flame> in terms of density of meaningful accesses
[07:53:03] <gilberth> The 8080, I grew up with executed instructions as fast it would read them. The bus is never idle.
[07:53:42] <gilberth> [With a very few exceptions.]
[07:54:10] <White_Flame> in the 6502, LDA #0 would be 2 cycles.  1 loads the "lda" opcode from RAM, the 2nd reads the 0 from RAM and stores it into A.
[07:54:25] <White_Flame> so there's no waste there
[07:55:41] <gilberth> Hmm, didn't dave0 suggest otherwise? How was stealing bus cycles for video done then?
[07:55:53] <White_Flame> 1MHz CPU on a 2MHz bus
[07:56:03] <dave0> i probably got it wrong, White_Flame sounds very knowledgable
[07:56:04] <White_Flame> the cpu could be halted if the video needed more
[07:56:25] <White_Flame> technically, the bus clock signal was 1MHz, but the 6502 would work on 1 phase, and the video on the other
[07:56:37] <gilberth> Sure, but I always got the impression that the CPU would run full speed.
[07:56:58] <White_Flame> PET, VIC-20, etc aren't interrupted at all
[07:57:06] <White_Flame> erm, in terms of bus availability regarding video
[07:57:19] <White_Flame> the C64 introduced that, to shove in more data to the video chip
[07:57:36] <White_Flame> would halt the CPU for 40 cycles every 8 scanlines, to read & buffer the next 40 chars
[07:57:52] <gilberth> ok, so the bus is only used half the time. In the former designs.
[07:57:55] <White_Flame> then use its normal bandwidth to grab the font data
[07:58:04] <White_Flame> right
[07:58:17] <White_Flame> DRAM refresh also happens on the cpu's off-phase
[07:58:35] <White_Flame> (which is normally done by the video chip, as it's incrementing through memory anyway)
[07:59:16] <White_Flame> but when the c64 halts the CPU, the CPU fully halts, even if it's mid-instruction
[07:59:17] *** Quits: Qwnavery (~Qwnavery@user/qwnavery) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[07:59:41] <White_Flame> it has no notion of waiting for RAM
[07:59:58] <White_Flame> while working on other things
[08:01:00] <gilberth> Ok. Quite different to the 8080 bus, which has a /READY signal for wait cycles on bus transfers and a HALT line, which must be acknowledged by the CPU which only would halt between instructions IIRC.
[08:02:42] <White_Flame> later chips in the 65xx line did add bus aborts delay states
[08:02:47] <White_Flame> *and delay states
[08:03:45] <gilberth> Anyhow my itty bitty TTL cpu has the same bus design with wait cycles and a HALT request.
[08:05:55] <gilberth> The latter I plan to use for debugging and development once I get around to actually build the thing. Hook some GPIO to the bus and you could upload things into the RAM or look at its contents.
[08:12:20] <moon-child> caches are for latency, not bandwidth.  Bandwidth-wise memory gets pretty close to saturating the cpu
[08:12:55] <moon-child> memory used to be faster than cpus, but it was also a lot smaller.  So you had to worry about page faults, which were similar to cache misses now
[08:13:10] <copec> you can actually bring up modern x86 cpu to use cache as main memory
[08:14:03] <moon-child> (though perf was still much easier.  No 'multicores'--let alone gpgpus!--to worry about, and if you just waited a year or two your cores got even faster)
[08:14:38] <White_Flame> in the single digit MHz days and slower, you didn't need to worry about any pauses in DRAM besides refresh
[08:14:55] <White_Flame> use complete addressing instead of reusing pages/banks/whatever
[08:15:02] <White_Flame> full random access
[08:15:23] <copec> btw when building your computer did you verify it detected the main memory at the correct speed hayley 
[08:15:24] <White_Flame> (although was that just a factor of the size?  don't recall)
[08:15:35] <hayley> copec: Yes.
[08:15:35] <moon-child> (re memory bandwidth--gpus have 10-100x cpus' memory bandwidth.  So we can make memory much faster, but it's not so critical for cpus)
[08:16:22] <White_Flame> they also have like 10x the width ;)

[08:16:59] <moon-child> White_Flame: yes!
[08:17:06] <copec> Anyone looked into the APIs how the PS5 sets up the SSD?
[08:17:20] <moon-child> nobody wanted gpus, but we have them and they're damn cool despite the annoyance
[08:17:27] <gilberth> I won't call it faster. Bandwidth is only relevant for kinda SIMD work. Not so much an issue with say a compiler. And latency-wise DRAM isn't really any better than 20 years ago.
[08:18:08] <moon-child> yes
[08:24:10] <gilberth> Like DSL was once pretty slow with 80ms latency and still is with around 30ms here. So for interactive work I preferred ISDN for quite some time, despite its 128kbps bandwidth but ~2m latency IIRC.
[08:25:17] <copec> I wish something like the PS5 was manufactured as an open base compute unit of sorts
[08:25:42] <White_Flame> isn't the ssd->gpu thing some sort of PCIe standard?
[08:25:53] <White_Flame> I know the xberries has that feature too, supposedly
[08:32:19] <copec> gilberth: I have VDSL2, it's link latency is ~14ms, back in 1996 I had a 256Kbs ADSL link that only had ~2ms link latency. The latency of DSL after that got much higher because it became standard to use interleaving of frames to increase reliability
[08:35:46] <gilberth> copec: Yes, here it was the reverse in general, interleaving was always the default. You could buy having interleaving turned off at some time, got out of fashion. AFAIK not available with my line.
[08:36:11] <copec> I had ISDN for a few years too when I lived at a different spot in the late 90's, it had a ~80ms link latency compared to a typical 56k modem that had ~130ms link latency
[08:37:21] <copec> The first couple of years we could get DSL in the area I lived at the time didn't have interleaving, and that's when the latency was really low, but after that it was always on without a choice of having it turned off
[08:37:29] <gilberth> Curious, my ISDN link from home to my company was single digit ms. Only downside: No flat rate.
[08:38:46] <kakuhen> i remember when i had DSL
[08:38:47] <copec> Yeah, I don't know why my ISDN had a high latency. I actually did a lot of troubleshooting with it but never figured that out
[08:39:25] <kakuhen> i may end up upgrading from fiber to DSL since fiber is too expensive
[08:42:15] <gilberth> I wish I could get fiber. Germany is a third world country wrt to internet connectivity.

[08:44:32] <copec> I managed a intranet at the time, and breaking off a single 64k channel off a T1 was usually low single digit latency, so I could never figure out why ISDN at home had such high latency
[08:45:17] <copec> It seemed to be all caused inside the phone company infrastructure, but getting them to figure it out was trying to push a mountain
[08:48:01] <gilberth> ISDN isn't really modulated unlike DSL.

[08:54:46] * hayley continues window shopping
[08:54:59] <copec> gilberth: Depends how it is delivered, when I was dealing with it all the phone companies used HDSL to get it to the demarcation point
[08:55:00] <hayley> "Select a FREE GIFT" Just pay $56k for the computer?
[08:55:57] <hayley> Still not 864 cores though.
[08:58:52] <gilberth> copec: Sure, but that I would call fake-ISDN. It's not ISDN delivered to your home. And yes, you can't get real ISDN here anymore, it's all DSL lines and VoIP, with modems just happening to have an S0 bus, if you wish.
[09:00:39] <copec> You could argue then that you could never get real ISDN here then
[09:01:26] <copec> nor T1/T2/T3s
[09:02:53] <copec> At least when I was dealing with it during the mid/late 90s
[09:03:14] <gilberth> Well, at least you could get UK0 to your home, which is just the ISDN bitstream and some power.
[09:04:45] <gilberth> And for a long time you could get that and DSL on the very same land line.
[09:06:34] <copec> not here, you could only get analog telephone lines unless you paid a lot of money to get business lines, and they would figure a way to get them to you
[09:07:08] <copec> Until ADSL, then you could get DSL along an analog line
[09:07:49] <copec> My work paid about US $500 a month for my ISDN in 1997/98
[09:07:52] <copec> Heh
[09:09:17] <copec> and that was brought to the outside of the house over HDSL, which isn’t a direct product they sold, but used to get T1’s or a fraction thereof to individual points 
[09:10:40] <copec> before they started using HDSL in the 90’s, the places you could get anything other than analog telephone lines, even paying the huge rates, were extremely limited

[11:51:49] <edgar-rft> If only *some* turtles can operate a browser then this explains why there are so little turtlenecks that fit because the market is just simply not big enough.
[11:52:41] <gilberth> Seriously this is extremely frustrating, I always have a very hard time to find clothes that would fit me. And yes, there does not seem to be a market for slim persons.

[11:59:35] <gilberth> Most frustrating are online stores, which don't let me pre-select on size. I would leave them immediately. Otherwise you would spot something nice, only to recognize it's not available in your size.

[17:06:41] <hayley> So, another way to do the damn read barrier (which I got from ZGC) is to snarf some high bits from the pointer, then use a TEST instruction and a bit mask for pointers which need updating. But I am not a fan of it, because having every pointer potentially need updating leads to a "trap storm".
[17:08:52] <hayley> I also avoided the Pauseless marking process, which does this too, because of the same problem. And that you get roughly the same guarantees w.r.t marking completion from both Pauseless and on the fly marking.
