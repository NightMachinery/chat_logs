[00:40:59] <ilmu> etimmons: interesting, compile-system is what guix does "by default" afaict
[00:42:06] <ilmu> sorry I've been a bit absent, christmas has been getting a bit in my way.. I will take a better look at this and come back with better questions.
[00:42:35] <rotateq> :)
[00:43:26] <etimmons> ilmu: one place compile-system is useful is if you're installing something, likely through a package manager, and aren't going to do something with that system immediately. That's because compile-system will produce all the fasls, so when you actually want to load-system, it goes faster

[10:19:02] <ilmu1> etimmons: I see, that makes sense then, what I am trying to do as a starting point is to figure out how to reproduce dev env and how to make it easy to install that way it'll be easier to work with others.
[10:19:27] <ilmu1> I hope I can make a nice template for using common lisp with guix

[16:49:06] <nij-> a subclass C of a subclass B of a class A  /is/  a subclass of A
[16:49:24] <nij-> how about replacing "subclass" with "instance"?
[16:49:44] <lisp123> Looks like it works :)
[16:49:57] <lisp123> nij-: subclass and instance have different meanings
[16:50:01] <nij-> an instance x of an instance y of a class A is not an instance of A
[16:50:15] <nij-> Yeah, so what do we call the relationship between x and A?
[16:50:25] <beach> lisp123: (loop for item in list collect (let ((stuff (some-fn item))) (if (null stuff) (loop-finish) stuff)))
[16:50:50] <lisp123> beach: Thanks! Much better
[16:52:13] * nij- has an urge to change his name to ";nij". Then anything he types without escapes is lisp code, and anything he types with escapes is also lisp code.
[16:54:05] <lisp123> nij-: What was your original question, sorry I joined late
[16:54:33] <nij-> \subclass \compose \subclass = \subclass
[16:54:41] <nij-> \belongs-to \compose \belongs-to = ??
[16:55:54] <nij-> Oh.. I just recalled. Mathematicians call similar things "subobject".
[16:55:56] <beach> nij-: The subclass relationship is between two objects of the same nature, so you can compose it as much as you like.  The instance-of relationship is between objects of different natures, and can't necessarily be composed.

[18:04:13] <rotateq> hehe yes in a way he is
[18:04:26] <dave-from-the-k> I just started with lisp. I used emacs for a while and spent some time on #emacs before

[18:05:27] <rotateq> here too
[18:05:53] <dave-from-the-k> its overcast here in london
