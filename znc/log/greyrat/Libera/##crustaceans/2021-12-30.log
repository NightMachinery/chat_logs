[00:44:19] <drakonis> microdosing seems like a way to rephrase drug abuse
[00:46:54] <manicennui> I don't think it gives them any advantage though, unlike abusing something like Adderall.

[02:50:02] <companion_cube> so I think we're going to get a freaky wave, right? where a sizable portion of the population gets covid within a few weeks
[02:50:58] <ngoldbaum> companion_cube: already happening
[02:51:10] <companion_cube> yeah yeah
[02:51:18] <companion_cube> but we're seeing the beginning of the slope
[02:51:37] <ngoldbaum> it‚Äôs not totally clear how much it‚Äôll go on for
[02:51:47] <ngoldbaum> in south africa it peaked and subsided quickly
[02:52:07] <ngoldbaum> indicating a lot of asymptomatic infections that aren‚Äôt picked up in testing
[02:59:40] <mouseghost> meh i thought that it was deaths now, not infections
[03:02:12] <companion_cube> hopefully it's a lot of infections but not deaths
[03:09:20] <mouseghost> yeah. from that ive seen vaccinations work in that regard
[03:09:37] <mouseghost> hopefully it will be enough for govts to ease the lockdowns and return to normal in the end
[03:13:01] <kline> omicron appears to evade vaccination but is less lethal regardless of vaccination
[03:13:18] <kline> vaccination is still good to ensure you dont get sick from one of the other variants though
[03:15:19] <mouseghost> sure. ill get boosted soon. but regardless, imo it all should go towards easing the lockdowns and things
[03:15:45] <indigo> I'm down with lockdowns; just give us all near infrared lights to strap to our foreheads so we can code all day
[03:22:00] <kline> as long as you dont give me that 830nm trash
[03:22:05] <kline> #850lyf
[03:29:52] <companion_cube> kline: does it evade vaccination, or just break through?
[03:29:59] <companion_cube> can still be less lethal to be vaccinated, no?
[03:30:12] <kline> yeah, defo get vaccinated
[03:30:47] <kline> but the mutation that makes it so infectious is also one that makes it less likely for your body to identify it as coronavirus
[03:31:04] <companion_cube> ah, makes sense
[03:31:06] <companion_cube> fuck that
[03:31:51] <Brekkjern> I had the impression that the spike protein was different, and as such the previous versions of the vaccines didn't produce the right type of immunity response, but it still "did enough" to put it like that?
[03:32:02] <mouseghost> eh who knows
[03:32:04] <mouseghost> its all fucked up
[03:32:18] <kline> biology is messy
[03:32:30] <kline> and having a vaccine is strictly at least as good as
[03:32:47] <kline> if nothing else, wild-type and delta variants still exist, so you're protected from those
[03:32:57] <mouseghost> itd less messy is all the things surrounding it were correct and nobody lied to get profit lol
[03:33:14] <companion_cube> like who?
[03:33:29] <kline> this doesnt sound like a productive path to go down, tbh
[03:33:50] <Brekkjern> I was about to comment something similar as kline tbh
[03:33:59] <companion_cube> yeah...
[03:34:04] <mouseghost> companion_cube, idk, corps or govt? it has happened already so... uh
[03:34:09] <mouseghost> kline, i dont follow
[03:34:15] <gwozniak> the lockdowns will ease when we're sure the hospitals won't be overrun.  Currently, we still don't know that
[03:35:18] <Brekkjern> https://i.redd.it/uowi88jtqj881.jpg
[03:35:18] <Brekkjern> lol
[03:35:27] <mouseghost> they all, even though they are unsure, say some things that turn out to be not true later
[03:35:29] <mouseghost> i dont like that
[03:36:04] <gwozniak> Brekkjern: yeah, that made me laugh (probably more than Rogan would)
[03:36:05] <Brekkjern> Lying and saying something that turns out to be untrue later is not the same thing.
[03:36:10] <companion_cube> well they had to say something
[03:36:22] <companion_cube> waiting 5 years for perfect knowledge would have been disastrous
[03:36:25] <gwozniak> Yeah
[03:36:58] <mouseghost> couldve said "well, we dont really know much, but well try" instead of "yeah we will just get vaccinated twice and everything will be back to normal"
[03:37:12] <Brekkjern> The original messaging in Norway was that masks were probably ineffective at containing the spread of the virus in the general public, and should be reserved for medical personell
[03:37:31] <Brekkjern> That turned out to be false, and now people are using masks while indoors.
[03:37:45] <gwozniak> The messaging I got was "get two vaccinations and there's a good chance things will get back to normal"
[03:37:58] <mouseghost> it was same here. though it was even mandated to wear masks outside for some time lol
[03:38:24] <mouseghost> maybe it also depends on the govt ;v
[03:38:27] <companion_cube> if everyone got two vaccinations, there might not have been the same variants
[03:38:44] <Brekkjern> It's only mandated to use masks inside if you can't consistently keep a meters distance to other people (which is kinda dumb as a meter really isn't enough...)
[03:38:45] <companion_cube> (everyone who could, I mean)
[03:39:01] <gwozniak> Possibly, yes (on two vaxx doses).  But that's pretty much impossible to know
[03:39:02] <mouseghost> but there also was a lot of information about awesome effectiveness of vaccines
[03:39:03] <kline> reminder: covid has killed more americans than have died in every war combined since the civil war, and thats just deaths and just in america
[03:39:11] <kline> covid has had trillions of mutation opportunities
[03:39:25] <kline> its amazing we havent had more dangerous and more evasive variations already
[03:39:30] <companion_cube> well they're quite effective against the first variants I think
[03:39:38] <companion_cube> omicron is just 140√ó more contagious it seems
[03:39:44] <mouseghost> tbh usa is a very distant place so there was no such bloody wars there, obviously, kline
[03:40:19] <kline> mouseghost, not wars in america, any american killed in war
[03:40:28] <mouseghost> yeah, i worded it incorrectly
[03:40:50] <kline> wwi, wwii, korea, vietnam, iraq, afghan, and all the "small" wars like china etc
[03:41:16] <mouseghost> well, nobody died there, because usa had a comfy situation of being away from everyone and could back out quickly
[03:41:20] <mouseghost> not many*
[03:41:31] <mouseghost> companion_cube, but is the knowledge about viruses so shallow that they just assumed the most positive outcome?
[03:41:36] <kline> still, think about how important these wars are in the american psyche
[03:41:37] <mouseghost> i dont understand that
[03:41:48] <mouseghost> im not from usa so i cant relate, sorry
[03:41:53] <kline> same
[03:42:03] <mouseghost> but i understand that it is a big part of american sense of greateness
[03:42:08] <kline> im just stunned they hold the dead of those wars in such high regard
[03:42:14] <companion_cube> the fun stuff is peak delta, where there was a 9/11 worth of deaths every day
[03:42:30] <kline> but are happy to piss away more innocent lives than those wars without a care
[03:43:02] <kline> if we called it the taliban virus or something you'd know america would be covid free
[03:43:38] <mouseghost> lol good thinking
[03:43:59] <mouseghost> or gay virus
[03:44:05] <mouseghost> "it makes you gay"
[03:44:15] <mouseghost> "get vaccinated against it now, so you dont turn out to be gay"
[03:44:24] <kline> cia, please arm covid with ak47s and hilux so it can bring about foreign policy change in the eastern hemisphere
[03:44:26] <companion_cube> it seems to affect fertility and erection

[18:53:23] <riv> i'm missing something.. the comment seems totally reasonable to me
[18:53:56] <riv> it's a reply to "you should compile C code with a C++ compiler" which is ... wrong
[18:54:33] <companion_cube> sure
[18:54:43] <companion_cube> you should update your C so it compiles with a C++ compiler
[18:54:50] <riv> should you really t hough
[18:54:55] <riv> why not rewrite it in rust?
[18:54:55] <buttsbot> >I told a coworker about lobste.rs, and futilely tried to convince him that it isn't HN for Rust
[18:55:11] <companion_cube> that's a lot more work :D
[18:55:24] <companion_cube> I mean, realistically, no one is rewriting gcc in rust
[18:55:27] <riv> the idea of converting thousands of lines of C into C++ just sounds like the worst thing ever, and the result would be atrocious as well
[18:55:31] <companion_cube> but they ended up moving to C++
[18:55:33] <riv> it would not be good C++ code
[18:55:46] <companion_cube> I imagine the conversion would be much easier though.
[18:56:09] <riv> well gcc is not a normal program :P
[18:58:01] <companion_cube> what is a normal program?
[18:58:35] <riv> what I mean is that I would not take  things that GCC does and apply them as general software engineering advice

[21:09:11] <gwozniak> When you have a big C code base that defines software for some embedded thing, for example, they really don't want to change it because the testing for it is insanely expensive
[21:09:17] <ngoldbaum> and any amount of careful code review isn‚Äôt going to help
[21:10:01] <gwozniak> Which is one of the main reasons we have to keep all that backwards compatibility in the compiler and libraries
[21:13:14] <gwozniak> A tech support call I had a couple weeks ago was for a project where the current testing takes many days for even small changes
[21:14:14] <gwozniak> They need to run exhaustive tests on the hardware configuration and stuff, but they do it with some simulator thing (I think) and it was hella slow
[21:15:21] <gwozniak> Then, whenever it is finished, I think there's a certification process involved which may involve evaluation by a third party
[21:16:24] <gwozniak> When I was working on my previous project I worked closely with the devs for some embedded thing and we suggested some code changes.  They sympathized, but then told us that will never happen
[21:16:25] <buttsbot> üëè developers üëè developers üëè developers üëè
[21:16:56] <gwozniak> "Make the bare minimum to port it to this new compiler" was the mantra
[21:17:42] <gwozniak> Regardless of the bugs that have been uncovered as a result of changing compilers
[21:18:26] <gwozniak> Changing legacy code has a high risk to reward, a legacy C code is even worse (as ngoldbaum mentioned)

[21:51:51] <dminkovsky> did an interactive rebase across a few commits today where i forgot to properly update a lockfile. was nice to stop at each one and amend the commit
[21:52:04] <dminkovsky> whoops
[21:52:15] <dminkovsky> wrong window
[21:56:27] <manicennui> How dare you mention git here.

[22:23:15] <manicennui> I remember that.
[22:24:12] <gwozniak> ``This is deemed to be efficient in some sufficiently geeky manner.''
[22:25:03] <manicennui> I miss geeky things in tech.
[22:25:16] <manicennui> Everything is very corporate now.
[22:25:55] <epilys> make an effort otherwise
[22:26:15] <manicennui> Too burned out on computer bullshit now.
[22:26:56] <epilys> I like working on small geeky projects for that reason, everything is too corporate
[22:27:11] <epilys> and it's like small carpentry projects
[22:27:48] <gwozniak> I work in my small corner of the world for my own enjoyment.  I'm not one who sees the need to share everything I do
[22:28:54] <gwozniak> Like, does my Emacs config really need to be public?  No, no it does not.
