[00:00:07] <Psi-Jack> Keeping state, that's where things become unsustainable.
[00:00:50] <arthur-_> I know how to do this manually with screen, but this is a script, I doubt screen's ncurses chenaniggans would play nice with the automation
[00:00:53] <Psi-Jack> arthur-_, Provide a better example of what you're trying to actually accomplish.
[00:01:14] <mutante> I dont see a difference between "ssh commands" and "commands". If you can make it happen locally, it can be run via ssh
[00:01:17] <arthur-_> Psi-Jack: git clone, then run docker, then inside the docker do a whole bunch of commands
[00:01:31] <arthur-_> and that needs to be done by a unit testing script
[00:01:33] <Psi-Jack> Sounds like you need a job with Ansible.

[00:04:07] <mutante> arthur-_: hence the writing the state somewhere?
[00:04:16] <arthur-_> Psi-Jack: there is a website that documents how to install some software. I am writing a script that does what the users normally would do by following those same instructions
[00:04:49] <Psi-Jack> arthur-_, So, you're actually trying to do integration testing, NOT unit testing.
[00:04:53] <arthur-_> Psi-Jack: part of that installation process includes things like git clone, sudo docker stuff bash, then inside that some more commands

[00:56:24] <rascul> what am i missing?
[00:56:29] <dTal> So, a question for #linux - I have a GPD Micro PC which has a physical switch to turn the fan on and off. This works well if you remember to flip it on before doing anything intensive, but it's easy to forget and drive it into thermal shutdown by clicking a video or something. Is there a good solution for having a sort of watchdog on the temperature? Obviously monitoring it is easy, but picking a sensible action is less easy
[00:56:30] <Psi-Jack> heh

[00:58:03] <rascul> arthur-_ so a single command up until that point, then another ssh command with the command you need the output of, saving that locally to a variable, which you can then use in the next ssh command
[00:58:12] <rascul> i can provide an example in  a minute
[00:58:13] <simbaclaws> dTal can you create a contraption that would switch the physical switch, or perhaps solder the wires to a logic board that can programatically switch it?
[00:58:37] <arthur-_> rascul: that's going to lose state
[00:58:38] <simbaclaws> then you could do temperature readings and make the fan kick in at a certain level
[00:58:52] <arthur-_> rascul: it's going to shut down my shell and start a new one
[00:59:03] <dTal> simbaclaws: an interesting bit of lateral thinking, and definitely a worthy mod - but the physical switch is also handy
[00:59:10] <arthur-_> so I'll need to re-run some commands to get back to that state

[02:03:41] <lacroix> yes... in traditional shell, a great many operators actually spawn subshells
[02:04:06] <simbaclaws> I feel like a neanderthal when I'm in this channel :/
[02:04:19] <geirha> subshells is one thing. This one spawns a new shell for each command
[02:04:20] <simbaclaws> so many smart people in here
[02:04:47] <niksen> smrt!
[02:04:51] <geirha> and it appears to silently fall back on sh if bash isn't found, so you can't rely on it being portable
[02:05:13] <lacroix> geirha, it'll be a subshell of the parent shell
[02:05:57] <lacroix> it's fairly nasty... portable will be tricky
[02:06:38] <geirha> lacroix: a subprocess, yes. Subshell is a fork of a shell (i.e. no exec)
[02:06:59] <lacroix> nwm you just want to convert the hex checksum into a base-10 int?
[02:07:30] <lacroix> geirha, it's a fork and an exec, otherwise the parent shell would be replaced
[02:07:56] <lacroix> it's a real subprocess, tied to the parent shell's process group
[02:08:13] <geirha> a subshell is when the shell forks itself, but without execing a new process
[02:08:17] <lacroix> mostly it just causes trouble when you're setting variables inside the subshell.. something to bear in mind...

[02:09:32] *** Joins: roro (~roro@user/roro)
[02:09:44] <lacroix> either way, the problem is getting variables back out of the subshell, otherwise you can ignore what's actually going on
[02:09:56] <lacroix> and many modern shells implement a lot of those functions as builtins, so they never fork at all
[02:10:21] <simbaclaws> if you set env variables inside a subshell, are they also accessible by the parent?

[02:14:22] <lacroix> nwm: ie, what input do you want to turn into what output?
[02:14:27] <geirha> if somecmd is a shell function, I would just have it populate global variables instead, and avoid the subshell

[02:25:52] <phogg> simbaclaws: if you want "everything POSIX works" then there are a few choices. If you want "ONLY everything POSIX works" then that's hard
[02:25:53] <nwm> lacroix, arbitrary string, going to be directory name, output has to be 0-9 with 1-9 initial
[02:25:58] *** Joins: Judabuda (~ok@user/judabuda)
[02:26:10] <geirha> simbaclaws: dash, bash and ksh at least
[02:26:35] <nwm> and has to be signed int due to use as uid/gid
[02:26:42] <geirha> zsh has an sh emulation mode. Not sure how close it comes, I rarely encounter zsh
[02:26:47] <simbaclaws> yeah I meant ONLY everything POSIX works, because that will help me write POSIX compliant scripts when I use things like bashism riht?
[02:26:48] <msiism> simbaclaws: If you want portability, it is much wiser to keep the usage of external commands POSIX than the shell script itself, I'd say.
[02:26:57] <phogg> if you run zsh you probably are not too interested in standards
[02:27:06] <nwm> and not below 100000000 iirc
[02:27:26] *** CR2032_1_5Volt is now known as sublim20
[02:27:26] <geirha> simbaclaws: dash has several extensions not covered by POSIX. There are no shells that are "only posix"
[02:27:53] <phogg> to have a working implementation you have to stray outside POSIX since it doesn't cover everything
[02:28:00] <lacroix> nwm: so you're just trying to create random numbers between 1000000 and 9999999?
[02:28:02] <msiism> simbaclaws: You can get Bash on any of the "usual" free Unix-like systems, for example.
[02:28:09] <phogg> and no programmer alive can resist innovation
[02:28:13] <simbaclaws> hmmm I thought having a shell that I can invoke that would be POSIX only would simplify creating POSIX scripts
[02:28:24] <simbaclaws> but I guess the shell doesn't matter then?
[02:28:25] <nwm> random but dependent on input
[02:28:53] <msiism> simbaclaws: The problem with POSIX-compliant shell scripts is that POSIX-only scripting is pretty awful.
[02:28:54] <phogg> simbaclaws: it does matter. Dash will be close enough for the most part.
[02:29:14] <lacroix> nwn: do you have a way to detect and reconcile collisions?
[02:29:26] <simbaclaws> I know it's aweful, but it also speeds up the execution by a lot
[02:29:34] <simbaclaws> in case of servers that might actually be a good thing

[02:30:50] <simbaclaws> what should I be writing server stuff in? Something like a c language or rust or go?
[02:31:14] <msiism> simbaclaws: No idea. Maybe use Ada.
[02:31:16] <rascul> what server stuff?
[02:31:18] <phogg> simbaclaws: it depends. Mostly just use whatever you like.
[02:31:18] <lacroix> nwm: So you're trying to turn some arbitrary input (could be text or whatever) into a random integer by feeding it through a hash and then extracting a certain number of digits?
[02:31:18] <nwm> the sha256sum one I posted should work, I may need to add digits though depending on the hash
[02:31:26] <nwm> yep
[02:32:05] <nwm> could probably just base 10 a string
[02:32:25] <phogg> simbaclaws: for *systems* stuff C is still popular, sometimes C++. Rust is sometimes used, maybe more in the future. For admin scripting stuff you'll see perl, python, awk, shell, and other things. It ultimately doesn't much matter unless you want others to collaborate with you.
[02:32:32] <simbaclaws> what if I wanted to employ a really fast api with database backend that sends back JSON or some other popular format. Would it be a good idea to do this in a low level language like c? Or would high level languages be the better option here?
[02:32:43] <simbaclaws> I mean the higher level language is easier, but usually tends to be slower no?
[02:33:18] * lacroix is very tempted to use perl or awk rather than shell per se...
[02:33:23] <phogg> simbaclaws: pro tip, that's premature optimization. Performance *does not matter* until you can prove it does with data and graphs.
[02:33:53] * msiism knows that "real databases" are overrated.
[02:34:06] <phogg> simbaclaws: you can probably get WAY faster execution speed with C than anything else, except maybe rust or very well crafted asm. But, do you need that at the expense of your time to develop the program?
[02:34:09] <simbaclaws> you'd go a flat file approach?
[02:34:11] <phogg> msiism: "
[02:34:12] <nwm> I could do it in awk
[02:34:28] <phogg> msiism: "real databases" were designed to solve a problem largely disconnected from applications that now commonly use them
[02:34:46] <simbaclaws> phogg got a point there, I just want something that can handle a lot of connections and is still pretty fast
[02:34:50] <msiism> phogg: Oh, right, that's probably a good way to put it.
[02:35:29] <phogg> Oracle is meant for data warehousing, where you batch import enormous chunks of data up front, carefully hand-craft indexes and views, and then run a variety of hand-crafted selects against them thousands and thousands of times. You may get new data *sometimes* in big batches, which you can merge in over the weekends. That's an RDBMS.
[02:35:39] <phogg> If you are using it as the back end of a web application you're doing it wrong.

[02:38:15] <phogg> So, if you want big batch-processing super-engines for storing data long term and pulling stats and reports out of it periodically, you want an RDBMS! But that was the 70s, and the 80s, and then some poor programmer came along and said "I have data that I want to access from multiple application processes at once. Is there a tool which can store data for me?" and the database guys said "Well, a database *can* do that. And "database" sounded good, so it got used t

[02:42:17] <phogg> storing documents by unique ID in an unstructured pile is really good at that

[06:32:20] <fac3> there are things Void provides that Arch doesn't, but some things might be easier on Arch than Void.
[06:32:24] <Psi-Jack> systemd was the first system I'd seen come to Linux that actually for once, made freaking sense.
[06:32:25] <fac3> there are pros and cons
[06:32:33] <Psi-Jack> And didn't blow up in your face when creating units for it, like upstart did.
[06:33:10] <Kyv> runit has blown up in your face? when?
[06:33:27] <fac3> runit makes sense to me at least as much as systemd. It also has been solidly stable for me
[06:33:31] <Kyv> I use it and this is news.
[06:35:07] <Psi-Jack> runit is just archaic, and not very pleasant to work with. About as nasty as sysv-init.
[06:35:20] <onelegend> lol its just an init system

[12:53:39] <lilsulor> What geirha said, an alternative if you tend to move files often between remote and local is to use sshfs
[12:54:03] <selckin> ssh is a protocol, scp makes a connection over ssh and runs scp, what you refer to as 'from the ssh' is an open ssh connection that started an interactive shell

[13:15:25] <mort> There's a driver, mwifiex_usb, which should in theory work with a marvell wifi card connected over USB. Everything looks correct; `lsusb` shows the device "Bus 001 Device 004: ID 1286:204e Marvell Semiconductor, Inc.", and `modinfo mwifiex_usb` lists 1286:204e as one of the devices it should work with.

[15:05:14] <mort> stupid question: I have a driver which names my wireless device "mlan0". I would prefer it to be named "wlan0" instead. Most persistent interface renaming stuff I've found are udev rules which specify the MAC address, but I'm working with a system image which will deploy on many different systems with different MAC addresses. Is there a way to get
[15:05:15] <mort> the driver to just name things "wlanX" instead of "mlanX"?
[15:06:23] <jjakob> mort: depends on what does the renaming
[15:06:36] <jjakob> which depends on the init system and user scripts
[15:06:45] <mort> the init system is systemd
[15:06:57] <jjakob> systemd does things differently than openrc than networkmanager than sysvinit...
[15:07:08] <SysGhost> systemd rules often are written to make the naming persistent
[15:07:11] <jjakob> ok, so search for systemd persistent interface naming
[15:07:34] <jjakob> there are settings that allow you to tweak systemd's behavior in naming those
[15:07:46] <jjakob> you could probably also override it with a udev rule
[15:07:46] <schillingklaus> another reason to avoid systemd
[15:08:20] <jjakob> schillingklaus: other init systems are starting to do the same persistent naming. personally I like that. but I don't like systemd for other reasons.

[15:47:03] <akik> it's not like i'm plugging devices in during the bootup
[15:47:08] <jjakob> there's no difference between boot or running because of hotplug
[15:47:23] <jjakob> and the way modules are loaded and detect hardware

[15:48:46] <schillingklaus> may hotplugging be disabled?

[15:49:48] <jjakob> right now, a module can decide it wants to create a device whenever, the kernel doesn't have a function that waits on it
[15:49:53] <mort> if, say, the driver tries to wake up a USB device but the device then has to spin up and whatever

[15:52:16] <jjakob> yeah well, maybe the kernel could be made to do that too
[15:52:18] <mort> systemd's wonderful non-interactive nature makes that so pleasant
[15:52:55] <jjakob> but right now the way to have non-racy interface renaming is to rename to something different than what kernel creates
[15:53:24] <jjakob> eth->eno, you get the point

[16:04:25] <akik> i can show the systemd log when it fails renaming

[19:03:35] <riv> I'm not sure why but sometimes when I have minecraft open my computer freeze up
[19:03:41] <riv> the mouse stops moving
[19:03:49] <riv> it sometimes start moving again for a sec, but then freezes
[19:03:53] <riv> usually I have to do a hard reboot
[19:03:58] <lacroix> will we get insulted here too?

[19:05:50] <riv> I tried adding ram settings to minecraft but the problem still happened
[19:06:09] <BCMM_> riv: well, have you checked how much free RAM you have, when you're running minecraft?
[19:06:36] <riv> I will try doing that, I leave top open on one screen then
[19:06:37] <BCMM_> if you're running in to swap at all, it's likely to hurt performance in the way you're describing, so expanding swap might not help
[19:06:48] <riv> I see
[19:06:51] <riv> thanks
[19:07:17] <lacroix> riv, the attitude you adopted in that other channel will get you banned here.

[19:08:15] <akik> i booted this computer 5 times ok. on the sixth time, the interfaces failed to rename but the journal check saw it and rebooted automatically
[19:08:35] <akik> i guess that's as much time i'm going to spend on it now
[19:09:43] <jelly> riv, java apps are known to need amounts of RAM.  Keep "vmstat 1" running in a terminal before and during the run of the problematic app, and look at the output
[19:09:52] <riv> thanks jelly
[19:10:09] <jelly> esp. swpd, si and so columns
[19:10:45] <jelly> a system that has enough RAM will mostly have a static amount of swap in use, and so usually at 0 or occasional tiny amounts
[19:12:14] <jelly> if there's a constant non-zero so (pages going to swap), and the amount of swap in use is rising to the configured limit, you need more RAM, or modify your workload to use less RAM
[19:12:53] <riv> I see, thanks! yeah, maybe due for more RAM

[19:58:33] <johnjay> the thing is linux is harder to use. but it's at least possible to figure out how to do what you want with stackoverflow, googling, and irc
[19:58:37] <BCMM> the other one, off the top of my head, is the various font parsing vulnerabilities windows has had over the years
[19:58:37] <qwedfg> like my sister for example was running windows
[19:58:55] <qwedfg> and she got hacked via google chrome twice and it installed some malicious extensions
[19:58:56] <johnjay> in windows if the thing you want isn't there... i guess code your own volume changing application?
[19:58:57] <BCMM> (which, inexplicably, appears to be done in kernel space!)
[19:59:10] <qwedfg> then windows update destroyed installation, linux since 5 years and no hacks
[19:59:15] <BCMM> qwedfg: i mean, she probably just agreed to install those
[19:59:26] <johnjay> (not a joke, I had to download nircmd.exe to change the windows sytem volume by command line)
[19:59:27] <BCMM> those don't sound like actual exploits

[19:59:43] <johnjay> (yes in windows 10)
[19:59:44] <qwedfg> I dont know google chrome well, but shouldnt it not ask such questions to the users considering they mostly click yes anyways

[20:12:58] <HaMsTeRs> johnjay, I found that out just today.  while trying to start docker inside wsl2
[20:12:58] <BCMM> a bit like how C headers (only useful to people building software) are packaged separately from their libraries (used by anybody running software)
[20:13:44] <johnjay> BCMM: i get the logic, but i don't like it

[20:14:07] <johnjay> if not outright compile and create a bootable image of it

[20:14:36] <johnjay> i remember being shocked that gcc/xcode wasn't available on mac os x by default even though it's a relative of unix
[20:14:40] <CrtxReavr> BCMM, that's an odd methodology to me. . . as a sysadmin for decades, I've always found it valuable to if not know the language your OS is developed in, at least understand its ecosystem, how binaries are built, etc.
[20:14:57] <Psi-Jack> Heh, that's not shocking. Why would that be shocking?
[20:15:20] <johnjay> sure, it's just the principle of it. in a world where software-as-a-service is increasingly the norm freedom isn't free etc etc. rms speech basically
[20:15:27] <BCMM> and developers shouldn't waste disk space on every single one of their machines just to save themselves from typing a one-line command on a new machine
[20:15:35] <johnjay> Psi-Jack: because most linuxes I've used have gcc right there on the command line
[20:15:56] <Psi-Jack> johnjay, No major distro comes with gcc installed, by default.
[20:15:57] <BCMM> johnjay; CrtxReavr: i think that only makes sense if you think the entire operating system needs to be delivered as, like, a single thing
[20:16:01] <BCMM> i mean, it's there in repositories

[20:25:02] <jjakob> so most it can do is pure emulation or just use hyperv
[20:25:25] <CrtxReavr> For instance. . . if you have Hyper-V installed, the normally very-functional vbox gets locked into "software emulation mode."

[20:26:24] <Kyv> Hell, even minimalist _base_ installs.
[20:26:27] <Psi-Jack> Kyv, They have it, but do not install it by /default/.
[20:26:38] <BCMM> oh, ok "Some system emulations on Linux use KVM, a special emulation mode which claims to reach nearly native speed. KVM is mainly used for x86 (32 and 64 bit) emulation on x86 hosts running Linux. There exists a highly experimental KVM for W32, but it is unknown whether it works with QEMU. Starting with QEMU 2.9, there is also a working acceleration similar to KVM, but based on Intel HAXM."

[20:35:53] <blackgatonegro> By the way wow so many sitcoms talked back against cliff notes... so they actually made kids aware they existed.
[20:36:01] <jjakob> well, you can have a binary thats precompiled that links to libc.

[20:36:20] <AiwendilH> glibc comes with docs in info format..."info libc". Not sure if those are usually in -devel packages

[20:36:37] <BCMM> jjakob: which is indirectly pulled in by build-essential, through libc-dev iirc
[20:36:57] <blackgatonegro> anything useful is usually is "readme" files or the Webpage.
[20:37:07] <BCMM> my point being that, if your system is set up so that you are able to write a program that calls flock(), you already have the man page
[20:37:13] <blackgatonegro> If you have a few hours to waste.
[20:37:17] <jjakob> nah, manpages are more useful
[20:37:18] <BCMM> unless you've done something weird in setting it up that way
[20:37:54] <jjakob> true, having headers and docs for libc is pretty useless without also compiling something
[20:37:57] <BCMM> however, there may be a problem if flock(2) is required reading to properly understand what flock(1) does
[20:38:30] <Kyv> It is almost as if distros which ship with 1500+ packages installed dont skimp out on sed, either.
[20:38:31] <jjakob> maybe only as a reference if you're reading already existing code
[20:38:35] <Kyv> It's horrific.
