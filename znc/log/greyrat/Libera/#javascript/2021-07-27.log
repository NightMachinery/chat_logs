[00:02:56] <ljharb> lego has been expensive since my childhood in the 80s
[00:03:08] <stenno> yeah but like, back then expensiveness was justified

[01:08:48] <wroathe> I have a hard time thinking of lego as anything but a toy. I grew up with a big collection of plain old legos, and I started getting some of the more specialized sets around the time I lost interest in it. Up to that point though, I always looked forward to a trip down to the big city where the mall had a big "legoland" attraction.
[01:09:10] <wroathe> So based on my personal memory with legos it's a bit strange to see adults actively seeking them out
[01:09:33] <wroathe> I probably stopped with them at around 10 or 11 or so

[08:06:38] <Rockwood_> your "pages" word confusing me, sorry i am very bad in english

[09:05:31] <ljharb> the language was always capable of iterating. coffeescript and babel didn't "enable" anything except the community locking in expectations prematurely.
[09:05:48] <sheetjs> the python schism calls that into question

[09:13:14] <ljharb> not sure where that's being quoted frojm
[09:13:40] <ljharb> the problem with TS is that it does provide some value - but it causes much more harm by encouraging false confidence
[09:13:58] <ljharb> TS isn't even a superset of JS, and you can even get type errors at runtime despite TS telling you you won't
[09:14:08] <hexeme> some hypothetical problem with the typesystem is worth no typesystem at all
[09:14:18] <ljharb> lol
[09:14:21] <ljharb> JS has a type system
[09:14:28] * hexeme rolls his eyes
[09:14:29] <ljharb> and with linting and tests TS provides no added value on top.

[09:15:00] <ljharb> i've never written python
[09:15:20] <Byteflux> Seems to be a trend. TypeScript is obviously popular and in demand and we also notice Python 3's typing is also quite popular. The benefits of static analysis that comes with type declaration is quite nice.

[09:17:16] <ljharb> it's straight incompetence to think that TS can obviate the need to write tests.
[09:17:24] <hexeme> they really solve similar, often overlapping, but ultimately different problems
[09:17:38] <ljharb> the problems TS solves aren'
[09:17:43] <ljharb> *aren't real problems that occur
[09:17:56] <hexeme> speaking of ideas we can disregard
[09:17:58] <Byteflux> I guess you'd have to weigh the downsides, I don't think they're pragmatically significant...
[09:18:22] <ljharb> hexeme: google spent years and millions of dollars researching "strong mode" in JS, and ultimately concluded that type errors *simply don't occur on the web* anywhere near often enough to warrant a language change to address it.
[09:18:46] <hexeme> type errors ocurr as you type the code, very frequently
[09:18:48] <ljharb> the kinds of things TS fixes are annoying, yes - but ultimately are insignificant.
[09:18:55] <ljharb> hexeme: yes but that stage doesn't matter
[09:18:56] <hexeme> as evidenced by the rate at which my IDE lets me know I'm making a mistake
[09:18:57] <hexeme> as I make them
[09:19:01] <ljharb> they don't make it to production with or without a type system
[09:19:06] <ljharb> thus, they *are not actually problems*
[09:19:27] <hexeme> yes, you have to spend a bunch of time runing your program first to find out that you misused some attribute that a type doesn't have
[09:19:38] <ljharb> or you write tests anyways and run it once
[09:19:42] <hexeme> or write a program to do a thing computers can already do
[09:19:50] <hexeme> don't forget to update once you change the code or interface

[09:20:04] <ljharb> if you're NOT doing that, you are already incompetent
[09:20:18] <ljharb> ask the typescript team themselves - TS does not obviate tests
[09:20:20] <hexeme> static typing will help you write better tests faster too
[09:20:34] <hexeme> it's your strawman that typing obviates testing
[09:20:35] <ljharb> writing tests quickly has never been difficult
[09:21:05] <ljharb> the only problem TS solves is that you don't have to switch to a terminal to run your tests command (which with a watcher like jest, would already have been rerun before you switched to it)
[09:21:36] <ljharb> it doesn't actually save your company any money, or stop any bugs. all it does is make you slightly less inconvenienced when writing code - which is the least important time in the dev lifecycle of any program. but it's not nothing, sure.

[09:35:11] <GreenJello> you get rid of some of the issues with dynamic types by making the database (where things live potentially forever) very strict

[12:25:20] <DPA> metaprogramming is awesome. You haven't been alive until you've dynamically generated classes from WSDLs at runtime.
[12:26:53] <sickdyd> DPA: excuse me Sir, please leave the premises
[12:27:33] <stenno> there are languages for which metaprogramming is integral, like ruby
[12:29:05] <stenno> js has the tools for it: Proxy, Reflect, getOwnFoo
[12:29:24] <Cork> stenno: slight modificateion s/ruby/ruby on rails/
[12:29:37] <stenno> Cork: ruby on rails is a framework, not a language
[12:29:57] <Cork> stenno: ya, but plain ruby don't use much meta programming
[12:30:10] <Cork> rails or event more specifically activerecords use it a ton
[12:30:35] <Cork> hmm doesn't use it a lot a mean
[12:30:44] <stenno> ruby encourages metaprogramming
[12:31:01] <stenno> in JS, its usually an indication of a bad program

[12:40:40] <stenno> thats a really silly statement especially without context
[12:41:38] <sri19> I'm guessing the context was "Your silly little app does not need custom virtual DOM rendering" ... but I must confess I didnt read the post fully, which is why I look for the URL now.

[22:07:06] <anddam> howdy, this is an odd one: I'd like to understand how Gmail handles mouse events on the chat menus. The element in question is ".J-KU.J-KU-KO.a65", using FF's dev tools I see it only has listeners attached to blur, focus, keydown, keypress and keyup, yet it handles the mouse click
[22:07:45] <anddam> my initial goal was to automatically click it to hide the chat section, now open by default since the covid meet update
[22:07:56] <ELFrederich> Hi, I'm new to JavaScript.  For Python I use an auto-formatter called "black".  For terraform I use the built-in "terraform fmt".  I believe Golang also even requires formatting to even compile.  Is there a de-facto JavaScript formatter?  If not, what are the top 2?
[22:08:12] <anddam> I have been suggested to just hide the part I do not want to see rather than mimicking an user click, yet it bugs me that I have no idea how that thing is working
[22:08:16] <anddam> any hint appreciated

[22:11:58] <anddam> teut: sorry I missed your earlier lines, what are you trying to obtain?
[22:12:18] <anddam> systemfault: so I need both and the plugin, right?
[22:12:31] <ELFrederich> systemfault, my point is... I'm not planning on running JavaScript outside of my browser any time soon.  But if eslint or prettier are implemented in node.  I guess I can install it for that purpose.  Should I "sudo apt install npm && npm install eslint"?
[22:12:32] <systemfault> ELFrederich: NPM is normally bundled with Node. Personally, I wouldn't use apt to install NodeJS, I would use "nvm" but if you really want to use apt then use the packages from NodeSource
[22:12:55] <systemfault> ELFrederich: Modern frontend workflows all use NodeJS

[22:13:06] <jellobot> (okay) [ 1, 3, 4 ]
[22:13:17] <systemfault> ELFrederich: NodeJS is used to minimize your JS, to build and assemble multiple files into one.. etc
[22:13:20] * ELFrederich looks how to install nvm
[22:13:31] <anddam> ELFrederich: once you install node and npm I'd install a node version manager, so the global version would just install the node version manager and then you have your own node versions
[22:13:33] <systemfault> anddam: Yeah
[22:13:35] <gehn> ELFrederich, https://nvm.sh/
[22:13:42] <gehn> it should have install instructions near the top
[22:13:51] <anddam> ELFrederich: I keep mine in ~/.local and setup npm env variables accordingly
[22:13:52] <ELFrederich> I thought NodeJS was javasript with OS bindings to run outside of browser.
[22:13:53] <teut> silly or just GreenJello told to use filter
[22:14:04] <gehn> ELFrederich, yes that's basically what node is
[22:14:30] <systemfault> ELFrederich: Yeah.. and you need for your build tools to work... so in the end, you have a "build" that can run on the browser
[22:14:34] <anddam> ELFrederich: npm is a package manager, you'll find yourself install tools of various nature, some utilities are "global", other are just for the current project
[22:15:18] <ELFrederich> so install nvm, then use nvm to install eslint?
[22:15:21] <gehn> ELFrederich, you can use node to make web servers, but you can also use it as a general purpose shell scripting alternative instead of bash for example
[22:15:56] <gehn> also node runs on windows, mac and linux and alpine so it makes your utilities more portable
[22:16:18] <anddam> gehn: I like how alpine is its own category

[22:19:37] <ljharb> nvm definitely works in alpine
[22:19:55] <systemfault> ELFrederich: From the beginning: Uninstall nodejs and npm(if installed) using apt... install nvm, install node with nvm, create project by creating a directory, cd to it... then do: "npm -y init". then you can start installing packages, like eslint for example
[22:20:02] <ljharb> ELFrederich: use nvm to install node. node comes with npm. use npm to install eslint into a local project.
[22:20:07] <GreenJello> what am I thinking of then, that you IIRC said is a shell that's a subset of posix
[22:20:22] <ljharb> i mean, stock alpine is missing a ton of stuff that makes it largely useless

[22:40:03] <banana_> yep
[22:40:05] <banana_> it does
[22:40:30] <banana_> because the event is an object with useful properties in it like targetElement etc.
