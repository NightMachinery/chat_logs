[00:08:08] <tabakhase> proph73 whats in that samplefile? such "version" would depend on whatever the upstream image (so the FROM in there is) - that may just be a "stable" - but when you check the image on the hub there likely is more (sometimes you need to go up 2 or 3 images in the food chain for that too) - also with this goes the note that you then may also want to "keep the image, not just the dockerfile" around 
[00:08:09] <tabakhase> as garbage collection does its thing when you depend on things ((unlikely that library images in big versions "disappear", but some random stuff may))

[00:10:36] <tabakhase> or also things like apt moving to archive-servers can break your dockerfile -- but as long as you have the image i guess you can say that docker is a somewhat reasonable form of archival yea

[00:43:10] <nickjj> proph73, i would lock things down to a specific version, including creating a lock file for your python dependencies, otherwise you run the risk of installing different versions of things in future builds (even with docker)
[00:44:11] <nickjj> if you install django 4.0.2 but django has ~10 sub-dependencies, if you build your app today vs 6 months from now chances are you'll get newer sub-dependencies unless they are explicitly locked down too

[01:38:12] <Aavar> Is it a good/bad idea to upgrade your docker containers (apt if it's debian based) ?
[01:39:02] <BtbN> It's very much against the idea of them being immutable
[01:39:15] <BtbN> And the next restart potentially undoes it anyway
[01:39:20] <BtbN> Update the image and start a new one
[01:39:23] <tabakhase> bad idea
[01:39:26] <tabakhase> very bad even

[01:39:52] <tabakhase> even if you do it in a Dockerfile, docker never deletes a thing, just keeps piling layers ontop
[01:40:03] <Aavar> Will they not include old software after a while?
[01:40:10] <BtbN> If you want to quickly fix a security flaw while new images are in the work, it's viable
[01:40:14] <BtbN> but don't expect it to persist
[01:40:20] <tabakhase> "right thing" is restart from the top, what should be no issue as your upstream should be doing the same
[01:40:29] <Aavar> WHat is the correct way to update a container?

[01:41:20] <Aavar> so, if the image (if that is what it's called?) is upgraded, the container will be also?
[01:41:20] <tabakhase> so, when a new debian:9 releases, node:7-stretch will hopefully rebuild, what will allow you to rebuild our-app:latest with a "fresh" node&debian under it
[01:41:32] <BtbN> no, the container will stay like it is
[01:41:38] <BtbN> that's why you scrap it and make a new one
[01:41:42] <tabakhase> replacing the container with the new image is "its own step" so to say
[01:41:48] <Aavar> BtbN: I mean the new container...
[01:41:57] *** Quits: malmalmal (~malmalmal@38.pool92-178-53.dynamic.orange.es) (Quit: Leaving)
[01:42:09] <BtbN> Docker Hub got rid of automatic rebuilds with the base image is updated sadly
[01:42:14] <BtbN> "Too much processing power needed"
[01:42:16] <BtbN> so, yeah...
[01:42:20] <tabakhase> and "replacing containers" - even with the same image, and some changed config, should also be no issue for you - consider docker-compose if you try to maintain a 423423 character long docker run command :P
[01:43:07] <Aavar> tabakhase: I think I will learn about docker first and then tackle docker-compose. One step at a time :)
[01:43:19] <tabakhase> BtbN paid... i think "officials" could still use it, but think docker-library team at least rather runs there own ci schedules to deprecate things out... no clue tho

[01:44:02] <BtbN> We have migrated away from Docker Hub wherever we can since they changed their policies
[01:44:34] <tabakhase> Aavar yes and also no - the nice thing is that docker run option and "what its called in compose.yml" map back&forth nearly 1:1 - so yes "raw docker" to understand lifecycle (and terms like container vs image) but to actually "do anything" jumping straight further to compose is just fine
[01:45:46] <Aavar> That's the route i'm taking anyways... I think the learning curve comming from lxc is quite steap :)

[16:16:02] <ada_> tabakhase: you can write provisioning code in ruby using vagrant and programmatically create VMs
[16:16:09] <tabakhase> ada_ i very much know, been using it since before docker and still do ;-) - i got 2000-line-vagrantfiles :D
[16:16:36] <CoolerX> tabakhase: ok, I think minikube starts the vm with hyperkit in my case
[16:16:53] <CoolerX> at least according to the guide https://dhwaneetbhatt.com/blog/run-docker-without-docker-desktop-on-macos
[16:17:13] <ada_> install virtualbox.  install a vm.  install docker.  ssh into vm.  use docker.
[16:17:35] <ada_> all this russian doll stuff with minikube is going to be problematic unless you already know what you're doing
[16:17:38] <ada_> just keep it simple
[16:17:48] <CoolerX> @ada_ I use docker for work, Docker Desktop changed their license and we can't use it anymore
[16:17:57] <ada_> define "can't"
[16:17:57] <CoolerX> have to use the docker cli or podman
[16:18:00] <stutz> like I said.. don't bother with k8s until he understands docker.
[16:18:08] <CoolerX> @ada_ can't as part of company policy
[16:18:09] <tabakhase> CoolerX i had just clicked your link and scrolled --- guess on a second look that page is split in two? option a minikube OR option b "manually"? then yea, forget what i said there
[16:18:44] <stutz> changed their license how?
[16:19:17] <ada_> CoolerX: ok, so keep it simple instead.  ignore minikube and hyperkit.  install virtualbox and set up a ubuntu server vm or something along those lines.  ssh into it, install docker for linux.  use docker in the vm.
[16:19:28] <CoolerX> stutz: this is not relevant to the error message but here https://www.docker.com/blog/updating-product-subscriptions/
[16:19:32] <ada_> CoolerX: or ask your work folks for an EC2 vm or something if you don't want to use your laptop
[16:19:47] <CoolerX> @ada_ I need minikube anyway for a local cluster
[16:19:56] <stutz> the relevent info has been mentioned a few times.. just don't use minikube unless you really need a k8s cluster 
[16:19:57] <CoolerX> I was using it anyway so it's not extra
[16:20:30] <CoolerX> @ada_ I have remote vms but I also need docker to work on my laptop
[16:20:30] <tabakhase> if that .1 is your host - you likely just missed some minikube instructions on how to allow the dockerVM to use or proxy from your hosts DNS
[16:20:35] <ada_> re:  https://bpa.st/YAEQ this is the wrong image name
[16:20:48] <ada_> red herring error message, that would be expected if you tried to grab any image with that format
[16:20:50] <tabakhase> try there actual installation docs rather than some random "worked for me" blogpost maybe
[16:21:12] <CoolerX> @ada_ yes it seems to be the wrong url, funnily enough it was working with docker desktop
[16:21:21] <CoolerX> docker cli that came with docker desktop
[16:21:40] <CoolerX> what is the correct url?
[16:22:23] <tabakhase> CoolerX smells like this expects a reachable dnsmasq https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/3036
[16:22:56] <CoolerX> I would have expted eval $(minikube docker-env)
[16:23:08] <CoolerX> to configure everything correctly for docker cli to work with the minikube docker daemon
[16:23:23] <CoolerX> well at least I can see the running containers with docker ps -a
[16:23:34] <tabakhase> run it without the eval and see :D - likely jsut prints some "export DOCKER_HOST=..."
[16:23:47] <CoolerX> but the registry stuff doesn't seem to have been configured properly
[16:24:07] <ada_> CoolerX: are you currently connected to a VPN or a work wifi network
[16:24:21] <CoolerX> tabakhase: is that environment variable same as -H option?
[16:24:29] <tabakhase> yeps
[16:24:29] <ada_> CoolerX: yes
[16:24:30] <CoolerX> because I think I tried that already
[16:24:38] <ada_> it isn't the client connection to the daemon
[16:24:44] <ada_> its the VM not forwarding your DNS request
[16:24:57] <ada_> you can see from the request 192.1...:53 
[16:25:15] <ada_> you're aking a DNS request and the request isn't being forward to the upstream DNS server correctly
[16:25:15] <tabakhase> "read udp 192.168.64.2:48848->192.168.64.1:53: i/o timeout" this, and only this is the issue -- where .2 is your vm - .1 likely should be your host, and :53 is dns
[16:26:21] <ada_> are you connected to a VPN or a work wifi network
[16:26:26] <ada_> corporate*
[16:26:26] <CoolerX> @ada_ ok so do I need to change some config in minikube?
[16:26:33] <ada_> I don't know what the problem is yet 
[16:26:36] <ada_> the root cause
[16:26:38] <tabakhase> dunno whats the mac version of "netstat -lpn" - but check if/what you have on 53 - then make sure thats not only localhost but also the vm-network-interface - and not blocked by any firewalls
[16:26:40] <CoolerX> because I need to start pods in minikube anyway
[16:26:52] <CoolerX> so if minikube can't pull remote images that's another problem I need to solve
[16:26:54] <ada_> CoolerX: are you connected to a VPN or a corporate wifi network ......
[16:27:01] <CoolerX> not yet but I can
[16:27:12] <ada_> don't change anything
[16:27:18] <CoolerX> I am just using docker hub and quay.io images for now to test this

[16:52:03] <ImQ009> Hello. I'm having an issue with pulling a standard Dockerfile from the Docker repo, I'm getting a "Client.Timeout exeeded while awaiting headers" error. I'm running the environment through a proxy, however, both the environment variables and the Docker config are properly configured for proxy (setup copied from a different machine). What else can I check? Is there some sort of verbose output I can enable in order to find out if 
[16:52:03] <ImQ009> it's actually trying to use the proxy?

[16:54:25] <CoolerX> it is sshing into the vm started by minikube and setting the dns servers to use

[16:56:47] <ImQ009> Or rather, I mentioned I was pulling a standard thingy, this is to clarify what exactly I'm pulling
[16:57:02] <tabakhase> ImQ009 aye ;D - so manual docker install in wsl2? (native, thats fairly new) - not just docker-for-win but yu use it from cli-in-wsl or so?
[16:57:22] <ImQ009> Yes, I use it from cli under WSL
[16:57:23] <tabakhase> and ok so NOT an image - but you are trying to build and it fails fetching the #syntax=... thing?
[16:57:44] <ImQ009> Eh, not sure what you mean by "#syntax="
[16:58:30] <ImQ009> But that's probably unimportant, right now, I'm just trying to get access to the Docker repo
[17:00:10] <ImQ009> To clarify, when I mentioned the docker config, I meant the config.json file located in ~/.docker/
[17:00:11] <tabakhase> some "#syntax=..." sugar in the Dockerfile is what switches buildkit to techting those i think - not to versed on Buildkit tho
[17:00:29] <ada_> ImQ009: thats your client config, not the server config
[17:00:34] <ada_> ImQ009: show the output from 'docker info'
[17:00:38] <CoolerX> ada_: ?
[17:00:40] <tabakhase> server is /etc/docker/daemon.json
[17:00:43] <CoolerX> tabakhase: ?
[17:00:45] <ada_> ImQ009: that will tell us if your client and server are configured correctly for the proxy

[17:04:56] <ImQ009> Ubuntu under WSL2 does not use systemd
[17:05:05] <ImQ009> At least, it doesn't appear that it does

[17:08:28] <ImQ009> Hmmm
[17:08:45] <ImQ009> Actually, it appears I don't have a "docker" service at all installed under WSL2
[17:08:51] <CoolerX> and hello-world works https://bpa.st/IROQ
[17:08:52] <ImQ009> So I don't think that applies?
[17:08:59] <ada_> you said you used wsl2 so I just googled it
[17:09:17] <ImQ009> Yeah, that result talks about a service which I don't have installed
[17:09:25] <ada_> how are you seeing that?
[17:09:31] <ada_> share what you ran and what you see from your term in that gist
[17:09:41] <tyson2> ImQ009: did you install docker desktop and configure it for WSL?
[17:09:45] <ImQ009> "docker: unrecognized service"
[17:09:49] <ada_> like, if it says 'edit /etc/init.d' then show me your contents of init.d
[17:09:50] <ImQ009> tyson2, yes
[17:09:59] <ada_> the "service" command is not reliable
[17:10:06] <ada_> because again, no systemd, no real init system
[17:10:28] <tabakhase> your paste also said "Operating System: Docker Desktop" "Kernel Version: 5.10.16.3-microsoft-standard-WSL2" -- are you looking in the wrong wsl? - check your hyperV-manager - but not sure what docker-desktop does there these days
[17:10:44] <ImQ009> I have only one WSL instance
[17:11:09] <ImQ009> And I can boot Docker images from within that WSL instance just fine
[17:11:27] <ImQ009> It's just failing to use proxy apparently

[17:14:41] <ada_> fwiw, can you paste a screenshot of your proxy settings page and the general settings page to that gist?

[17:17:06] <tabakhase> ImQ009 about the "right wsl" - i dont know what dockerDesktop is supposed todo, but it running in your "Normal user box" would be a bit strange... see if `wsl.exe --list --all` spits anything more pls

[17:42:40] <texasmynsted> Does anybody here use docker, locally (on their local machine), for something other than replicating a remote server environment or doing local development?
[17:43:31] <tabakhase> texasmynsted a bunch, ive got 500 lines of aliases in my bash-profile that give me "shell commands as container"
[17:44:11] <tabakhase> `jq () { docker run -i -v "$PWD:/host:ro" --workdir /host --rm stedolan/jq "$@" }; export -f jq;` and there like for example
[17:44:46] <texasmynsted> I have _some_ of those but I have slowly started replacing them. I would love to read how others are doing this. Especially when you get many of them.
[17:45:36] <tabakhase> or this one, even includes a whole docker-build with a dockerfile "as one compact unit" https://paste.debian.net/1229896/
[17:45:36] <stutz> tabakhase .. why? literally curious
[17:45:41] <texasmynsted> With many it seems like a bunch of overhead, but maybe not. You just do run with rm execute the single command and terminate?
[17:46:01] <stutz> like why run jq thru docker
[17:46:58] <tabakhase> why not :D -- and jq is just random example
[17:47:00] <texasmynsted> An example: pdfsadwich. I want to re-setup pdfsandwich, this time as a container. There are many dependencies... 
[17:47:34] <tabakhase> texasmynsted docker is a shared kernel, so the only overhead rly is that it writes out a few json files before - but thats like miliseconds if even meassureable generally
[17:48:24] <texasmynsted> I have more than one machine so I thought I could run k3s on them or something and have them distribute load.
[17:48:45] <tabakhase> and docker is perfectly fine with slim and even short-lived containers - so this isnt "alien" or so but a perfectly supported method todo things
[17:49:45] <texasmynsted> okay. 
[17:50:18] <texasmynsted> Do you have larger containers, like what would be needed or pdfsandwich (ffmpeg, a bunch of graphics libs, etc.)?
[17:51:20] <texasmynsted> I think I used to use LaTeX this way. A container with _all_ the LaTeX libs.
[17:51:43] <tabakhase> not directly, but i dont see a problem in that either asside from transfer-time if those hit the network :P
[17:51:57] <texasmynsted> Do you have suggestions on how to smooth this process? (Or is it just normal docker?)
[17:53:41] <tabakhase> (note, were talking of having those things avaliable for exec()ing out on -- NOT "running multiple things in one container" just to be quadrupel-extra-clear there ;-) -- docker likes "one thing per box" (where "pdf does exec(ffmpg...)" still counts as one)
[17:53:57] <tabakhase> so yea, nothing wrong with installing that all in one there
[17:54:56] <texasmynsted> yes. A single command for pdfsandwich to OCR a pdf file. (I do not know what it does internally to make that happen. It might run a number of shell scripts. I have no idea.)

[18:12:00] <tabakhase> not sure on differences there - but carefull on the word "baseimage"... this one looks fairly innocent, but "baseimages" are often used in conjunction with "fat containers" - so, containers that break the rules and "do more than one thing", usually running an actual init-system inside (tinyint, s6, runit, dumbinit are all seen regulary) -- there is a usecase for these things.. but it should

[18:26:30] <ada_> like, for me, running a registry on my laptop doesn't solve anything
[18:26:31] <tabakhase> texasmynsted running a registry is one docker command away yes - likely not needed tho, if hub doesnt appeal, many options these days
[18:26:40] <ada_> I don't do it, I just use images from public registries
[18:27:30] <tabakhase> guess you kinda could need it when doing swarmstuff? - no clue tho :P
[18:27:38] <ada_> you might
[18:27:48] <texasmynsted> k3s
[18:27:49] <ada_> like I said, I start with a problem to solve
[18:28:25] <ada_> if I have to build an airgapped cluster to mimic a customer environment, it will have a registry, or I might leverage something like ECR or GCP if my customer does the same thing
[18:29:32] <ada_> I find that for my use case I can rely on public registries for my workstation needs.  I have a cluster on my home theater pc and it uses images from public registries, too
[18:29:44] <texasmynsted> problem: 2 macOS machines with TONS of macports ports and homebrew installs. Some are/were replaced by docker then became replaced back with homebrew or whatever ...
[18:30:47] <tabakhase> i know some of these words... :D
[18:31:14] <texasmynsted> would be nice to be working on primary machine, execute a command and have it run on secondary machine to reduce load on primary
[18:31:34] <tabakhase> setting DOCKER_HOST can do that pretty easy
[18:32:06] <texasmynsted> Would be nice if it was automatic.
[18:32:09] <tabakhase> can be plain tcp (insecure obvs) or client-certificates ssl-stuff - or even ssh:// dailing these days then nothing to setup at all
[18:32:41] <texasmynsted> Share containers over the two machines. Update in one place, updated for both. That sort of thing
[18:32:56] <tabakhase> ssh-dailing is no setup other than obs. the ssh login ^^
[18:34:09] <tabakhase> (with a remote daemon publishing ports obvs happens "there" not on your pc, and bind-mounts wont work either (here one can use ssh-fs for example) - or just "docker cp"
[18:35:15] <texasmynsted> What is this called? obvs? or ssh dialing? 
[18:37:42] <tabakhase> not sure what you mean... but there rly isnt much more to it than `export DOCKER_HOST=ssh://user@192.168.1.2` or there like (where user has the dockergroup, or root instead)
[18:38:19] <texasmynsted> okay. Sounds like I just need to learn more docker
[18:39:15] <texasmynsted> Ideally I would like to have stuff setup on local workstation and laptop. When home, on home network run docker jobs from workstation, when away (on laptop) have them run on laptop.
[18:39:22] <texasmynsted> Have this process, just work.

[18:40:51] *** polymorp- is now known as polymorphic
[18:42:41] <ada_> there's no way to "share" containers on more than one machine at a time
[18:43:03] <ada_> you can configure your client with contexts;  set a local context and remote context
[18:43:23] <ada_> maybe you write some shell code to automatically switch when you're on a certain wifi network or something
[18:43:54] <ada_> that should be doable with Automator.app
[18:44:08] <texasmynsted> I think kubernetes works this way?
[18:44:16] <ada_> think it works _what_ way
[18:45:02] <texasmynsted> Setup a place to run the images, more than one in fact. When a machine is available it is used, if not, it is not.
[18:45:15] <ada_> how do you imagine that would work in this case
[18:45:22] <ada_> join your laptop and your server to the same cluster?
[18:45:29] <texasmynsted> replace the word images with container, pod, whatever the right name is
[18:45:40] <texasmynsted> yes
[18:46:19] <ada_> well, if you hae your manager running on the server, and you go offline, then all your pods die and get rescheduled to the server.  things like command line utilities that just run and exit will just exit
[18:46:20] <texasmynsted> If that is unreasonable then I will try something else
[18:46:26] <ada_> and then if you can't reach teh master you cant run more pods
[18:47:03] <ada_> if you run the manager on your laptop, then what?  you get home, and pods don't automatically rebalance to the new node
[18:47:07] <texasmynsted> So it sounds like a command line option would be a better fit.
[18:47:10] <ada_> so you kill them, they might move over
[18:47:17] <ada_> yeah its just not really a great solution to this problem
[18:47:22] <texasmynsted> Just run a command "i-am-home", "i-am-away"
[18:47:36] <ada_> again, how is that better than just having 2 docker contexts that point to your local machine or your server
[18:48:06] <ada_> sorry if that sounds prickly I'm just having lots of conversations at the same time and trying to think fast
[18:48:47] <ada_> then you have data persistence to worry about
[18:48:48] <texasmynsted> I am trying to say that I think your non k8s solution sounds better. I am unclear why your solution is. 
[18:48:56] <ada_> so if your pods are moving, how do you make sure that the state of your data is also moved
[18:48:57] <texasmynsted> s/why/what/
[18:49:41] <texasmynsted> What do I need to read about to setup your solution?
[18:51:34] <texasmynsted> Sounds like: 1. setup docker on both machines. 2. Create necessary container/images 3. Somehow populate them to both machines 3. Have a way to alter DOCKER_HOST variable as needed.

[20:41:06] <ablegreen> i know it's a stupid question (virtualbox/vmware can't emulate a different arch), but just want to get confirmation
[20:41:44] <ablegreen> actually virtualbox doesn't even support m1 hosts, so the question is for vmware i guess
[20:42:17] <tabakhase> i dont know mac stuff, but id like to say "yes"
[20:42:44] <tabakhase> tho, m1 stuff has been changing rapidly...
[20:43:46] <rvalue> ablegreen: i guess whatever is (uname -m) in the guest
[20:44:12] <minimal> ablegreen: it will need to be whatever the arch of the VM is - if you run a x86_64 with docker inside then you need to use x86_64 docker images, in the VM is aarch64 then you need to use aarch64 docker images
[20:44:27] <ablegreen> yeah support for m1 is getting better, but some devs are still using old docker images that don't have an arm64 build. behavior is unpredictable with qemu
