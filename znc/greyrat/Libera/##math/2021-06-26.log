[00:15:05] <CalimeroTeknik> not even it seems: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iCoBU0o86Q says the reason is 1 = √1 = √(-1)×(-1) = √(-1) × √(-1) = i × i = -1

[00:15:28] <CalimeroTeknik> ah?
[00:15:47] <[itchyjunk]> uh
[00:15:48] <int-e> it's just that when extending sqrt() as a *function* to the complex numbers, you lose the law sqrt(ab) = sqrt(a)sqrt(b)
[00:16:35] <CalimeroTeknik> I see
[00:17:34] <int-e> Of course, people disagree on what to do with that phenomenon. Some treat sqrt() as a two-valued functions (except at 0) in the complex numbers, so it's not a function. Others pick a "principal value" out of the two possible square roots, usually the one with non-negative real part, and with a non-negative imaginary part when the real part is 0.
[00:17:42] *** Joins: kenthurley (~quassel@acfa64.neoplus.adsl.tpnet.pl)
[00:17:46] <int-e> The latter choice gives sqrt(-1) = i.
[00:18:43] <int-e> The former preserves sqrt(ab) = sqrt(a)sqrt(b) in the sense that each square root of ab is a product of a square root of a and a square root of b, and vice versa.
[00:18:47] <CalimeroTeknik> right, so the video I cited argues a two-valued function

[00:19:28] <int-e> I prefer having a function. Maybe that's a computer science thing.
[00:19:42] <kenthurley> Why are there so few books that show not only proofs but also the pathway that led toward them? That's really surprising
[00:19:53] <CalimeroTeknik> yeah, I usually consider the function to be x → |√x|
[00:20:14] <int-e> kenthurley: because then you'd probably have a book per theorem
[00:20:27] <CalimeroTeknik> is there any issue with "absolute value of -i = i"?
[00:20:47] <kenthurley> int-e: nothing specially bad at is. Also, they wouldn't have to include all the details
[00:20:50] <Galois> "Primes of the form x^2+ny^2" explains a lot of the false starts and dead ends that occurred historically in that topic
[00:21:02] <int-e> CalimeroTeknik: well the usual norm *does* have the property |ab| = |a||b|
[00:21:29] <Galois> including the place where Lagrange failed to define the class group because the thing he obtained wasn't a group (even though group wouldn't be defined until 50 years later)
[00:21:48] <Galois> and then where Gauss fixed Lagrange's construction to obtain the class group, even though group wouldn't be defined until 30 years later
[00:23:29] <kenthurley> Second thing, is there something accessible on classification of finite simple groups?

[13:41:39] <joel135> Let Q be the square with vertices [±1, ±1] and edge bisectors W,E,S,N ([-1, 0] etc). Consider the problems P1 and P2 of drawing a curve in Q from W to E or S to N, respectively, without crossing the opponent's curve.
[13:42:34] <joel135> Obviously, P1 and P2 are not simultaneously satisfiable. Conversely, what is a theorem to the effect that if S1 is a "nice" subset of Q, with complement S2, then either P1 is satisfiable within S1 or P2 is satisfiable within S2?
[13:42:39] <int-e> . o O ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_(board_game) )
[13:42:57] <joel135> aah good one!
[13:43:28] <int-e> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_curve_theorem
[13:44:15] <joel135> how do you connect it to the jordan curve theorem?
[13:44:16] <int-e> (it's not quite immediate, but note that you get a closed curve when you take a curve connecting two opposite sides, and then close it along the border of the square)
[13:44:55] <joel135> hmm
[13:45:59] <int-e> And there's still some work to be done after that.
[13:47:45] <int-e> joel135: There may be a better tool; I don't really know this stuff.
[13:48:25] <nejimban> iirc for the square problem you can use the non-planarity of K₅
[13:48:39] <joel135> i see that the jordan curve theorem implies the "obviously" part, but not the "conversely" part. the theorem takes a curve as "input" whereas the "conversely" part produces a curve as output.
[13:48:45] <nejimban> you connect W,E,S,N to a fifth vertex away from the square
[13:48:55] <int-e> Oh, it's probably better to close the curve *outside* the square, not following the square's border, so that the opponent's curve starts in the interior and ends outside.
[13:49:43] <int-e> curve->path
[13:50:16] <int-e> you only have to close one of the paths
[13:51:08] <joel135> i see that the K₅ thing gives the "obviously" part too, but not the "conversely" part
[13:52:22] <int-e> so https://int-e.eu/~bf3/tmp/cross.png
[13:53:20] <joel135> right, that exhibits W as outside and E as inside, given any path from S to N

[14:05:55] <int-e> joel135: I suspect a checkerboard is fine... since each corner has to belong to one of the players, and that player can cross over diagonally while the other one can't
[14:06:25] <joel135> agreed, if we just add that data at each such corner

[16:16:14] <Fangs> (I'm not even sure what your mistake was if any)
[16:17:26] <int-e> So the [21] coefficient of the result of D is 2n <coefficient of [112]> + (n-2) <coefficient of [13]> + 2(n-1) <coefficient of [21]>, that corresponds to the equation that confused me.

[20:56:21] <aruns> :P
[20:56:39] <bildramer> then there are various algorithms for square roots, but when I naively estimate things like that I think "it's between 4 and 9 so the square root is between 2 and 3, try 2.5, that gives 6.25, too low, try 2.75 (binary search) or 2.7 (for simplicity) or 2.6 (intuition says it shouldn't be that far from 7)"
[20:58:23] <aruns> Yeah that's what I do too
[20:58:26] <bildramer> or use the binomial formula and ignore the square term, so 2.5 squared gives 6.25, 2.5+x gives 6.25+5x+x^2, solve 6.25+5x=7 to get x=0.15, so try 2.5+x = 2.65, that squared is 7.0225, close enough

[21:39:59] <rubiksdream> [itchyjunk], you dont need much real analysis for it
[21:40:10] <rubiksdream> [itchyjunk], assuming by C you mean complex numbers
[21:40:42] <rubiksdream> needham visual complex analysis is a good book to learn calculus on C
[21:41:16] <[itchyjunk]> oh i have that book

[21:42:59] <tolarz> savask: read the first 4 sentences of the intro

[21:49:11] <rubiksdream> in practice, if \gamma is a continuous (not necessarily piecewise C^1 curve) in the complex plane, then we can define int_{\gamma} f dz = \phi(1) - \phi(0), where \phi(t) = F(t)(\gamma(t)) and F : I -> O ( (O,p) is the sheaf of germs of holomorphic functions on C) is a primitive along \gamma of f, is this equivalent to defining int_{\gamma} f dz as the limit as \gamma' -> \gamma of \int_{\gamma'} f dz, where \gamma' is piecewise C^1?
[21:49:32] <rubiksdream> it seems like it ought to be
[21:49:41] <[itchyjunk]> hmm
[21:49:43] <rubiksdream> oh, f is defined in some open set containing \gamma (of course), and is holomorphic
