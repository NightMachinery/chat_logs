[00:43:12] <FreeBDSM> so with read - I can list dirs contents, but without any info other tan file names
[00:43:23] <tirnanog> the reason ls doesn't give you anything more than the names is that the absence of the +x permission makes it impossible for the files to be stat'ed.
[00:43:31] <tirnanog> granted, it doesn't handle that very gracefully.
[00:43:48] <tirnanog> in any case, without +x in effect, you cannot access the inode data of any of these entries.

[00:46:41] <tirnanog> someone, somewhere might have a use case that entails being able to list the immediate entries of a directory while being able to do little else. but even if that were not the case, at least the model is somewhat orthogonal.
[00:47:05] <tirnanog> the r bit should mean something and, given that a directory is actually just a special kind of file, it does make some sense. you can read the entries with +r and you can manipulate them with +w (including unlinking).

[01:51:38] <KipIngram> I'm trying to use a named pipe to give me command prompt control over a program that has its on console interface.  I can set it all up, and then if I say "printf "\n" >pipe" the program will begin doing its things.  If, instead, I say "printf "\nq\n" it will start up, and immediately quit, responding to the q command just as if I'd typed it.
[01:51:54] <KipIngram> But in every case, once it finishes with the first string, it sees nothing else that I write into the pipe.
[01:52:02] <KipIngram> It's like once the pipe is empty, it stops looking at it.
[01:52:24] <KipIngram> I'm wanting it to treat the pipe EXACTLY like the keyboard, so that whenever I send a new command into the pipe it gets acted on.

[01:54:45] <KipIngram> I see what you're saying - I'm opening and closing the pipe every time I printf to it?

[01:55:33] <KipIngram> So it's when I CLOSE the pipe that the other end is then thinking I'm done.
[01:55:56] <twkm> expect is an extension to tcl that provides what you are after, programmable i/o to a program as if it was the keyboard and monitor.
[01:56:00] <tirnanog> you could use exec to open it, and close it later. expect might indeed be what you want, though.
[01:56:55] <KipIngram> Well, my interpretation of expect was that it gave me a way to recognize prompts printed by the application.
[01:57:14] <KipIngram> But my app doesn't really do that in any organized way - it just waits for keystrokes (q being the most significant one - quit).
[01:57:39] <KipIngram> I don't really need to pay any attention to the app's output - in fact eventually I'll probably run it with >/dev/null.
[01:57:57] <tirnanog> alternatively, ensure that the redirection encompasses all of that which must be written. for example, by using a function or a compound command.
[01:58:00] <KipIngram> in the background - right now I want to see its output so I know what I'm accomplishing.

[02:01:40] <KipIngram> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8410439/how-to-avoid-echo-closing-fifo-named-pipes-funny-behavior-of-unix-fifos
[02:01:47] <KipIngram> has an interesting suggestion.
[02:01:56] <KipIngram> sleep <long time> >pipe &
[02:02:08] <KipIngram> ./app <pipe
[02:02:18] <KipIngram> Then echo <command> >pipe
[02:02:23] <KipIngram> And that seems to work, so far.
[02:02:27] <twkm> looks more like idiocy, but whatever makes you happy.
[02:02:32] <tirnanog> that seems rather silly, to say the least.
[02:02:36] <KipIngram> :-)
[02:02:43] <KipIngram> Yeah, it does seem like a kludge.
[02:03:10] <KipIngram> This is an interesting problem and a good chance to skill-improve, so I'll keep at it.  But this at least works for the time being.
[02:03:24] <tirnanog> or, you could consider one of the three suggestions given.
[02:04:45] <KipIngram> Yes, I will - I want to learn about all of them.

[09:44:43] <kurahaupo> As I mentioned before, that description assumes that the shell user understands printf specifiers, and struct timeval, and what localisation does, and that we'll never want nanosecond precision. I would prefer a description that doesn't make those assumptions
[09:45:51] <KombuchaKip> e36freak: I'll get the GNU awk manual.
[09:46:23] <kurahaupo> Technically it's "microseconds since 00:00 1 Jan 1970 UTC but not counting leap seconds", which just goes to show how badly broken time_t really is

[10:02:23] <kurahaupo> emanuele6: My principal objection wasn't that it was wrong before 1970. Rather, that the actual C code is broken by making a half-baked attempt at localisation, with the result that it's neither useful for computation nor for showing users. And the factoid fails to provide a human interpretation of that snippet of C code.
[10:02:24] <kurahaupo> !learn EPOCHREALTIMEμs EPOCHREALTIME contains the UNIX epoch time as seconds since 1 Jan 1970 00:00 UTC, to microsecond resolution. The decimal point of the current locale is used, but not thousands separators. We recommend setting LC_NUMERIC=C before using it in calculations.

[13:08:07] <FreeBDSM> A shell script file with execute permission only will not run!  This is because any script file (including Perl scripts) cannot be executed directly by the system with an exec() system call.  Instead the proper script interpreter (usually shell) is actually executed.  This interpreter in turn attempts to read the script file.  It is possible to run a script without execute permission by entering sh script

[15:00:16] <greybot> you do it like this by the way: Command Substitution: "$(cmd "foo bar")" causes the command 'cmd' to be executed with the argument 'foo bar' and "$(..)" will be replaced by the *output*.

[17:42:08] <kurahaupo> And you can stack more than one: cat <<E1 ; test && cat <<E2 ; cat <<E3 (newline) … E1 … E2 … E3
[17:42:26] <emanuele6> !$*
[17:42:26] <greybot> The difference between $@ and $*: "$@" (quoted) expands to each positional parameter as its own argument: "$1" "$2" ... while "$*" expands to the single argument "$1c$2c..." where c is the first character of IFS. You almost always want "$@". The same goes for arrays: "${array[@]}" or "${array[*]}". Unquoted $* and $@ are undefined; DO NOT use.
[17:42:30] <kurahaupo> greycat: Hmmm?
[17:42:48] <greycat> your client sends these weird escape sequences to produce "italics" or something
[17:43:06] <greycat> So it's perfectly valid to write: if foo; the cat <<E ; fi ^](newline)^O^C99,99 … ^](newline)^O^C99,99 E

[17:44:02] <kurahaupo> greycat: So your IRC client doesn't do mirc codes?
[17:44:05] <greycat> It "works" on my client as well (I see them as italics and stuff), but it's certainly weird and unique, and he's got those unprintable bytes in at least one bot factoid now

[17:46:25] <emanuele6> see section 5.2.5
[17:46:31] <pystardust> I use the bash vi-style mode of readline. I just found out that ctrl-n ctrl-p autocompletion selection. This blew my mind. I couldn't find this in the manual. Where can i find the vi-mode defaults
[17:46:33] <emanuele6> it explicitly defines $* and $@
[17:46:54] <emanuele6> what it doesn't define is the behaviour of stuff like "hello $@" 
[17:47:26] <lopid> is C-n vi-mode only? looks for "READLINE"
[17:47:30] <lopid> -s
[17:47:43] <greycat> C-n is "move down to the next line" in emacs mode
[17:48:07] <pystardust> lopid: yes c-n in vi mode is nowhere to be found in the manual, its defined for the default mode
[17:48:27] <greycat> formally mapped to "next-history" according to the man page
[17:48:28] <emanuele6> c-n is menu-complete
[17:48:35] <emanuele6> (in vi mode)
[17:48:44] <emanuele6> it is not bound by default in emacs mode
[17:48:45] <greycat> so it seems, yes
[17:49:06] <pystardust> but how do i know what these defaults are?
[17:49:10] <greycat> ... "so it seems" referring to the menu-complete thing, not the claim that it has no default meaning ni emacs mode
[17:49:22] <greycat> pystardust: bind -p
[17:49:32] <geirha> bind -m vi-insert -p
[17:49:36] <geirha> and the same for vi-command
[17:49:39] <pystardust> ahhh, nice
[17:51:28] <pystardust> just wondering can i make my own custom modes?
[17:51:39] <kurahaupo> emanuele6: Given that "$@" splits into args to match the original, and adjacent strings (like foo"$bar") are simply concatenated, the behaviour "foo$@" seems fairly obvious to me
[17:52:26] <greycat> "foo$@bar" with quotes expands to the same thing as "$@" except that the first word in the list has "foo" prepended to it, and the last word in the list has "bar" appended to it
[17:52:39] <emanuele6> greycat: you added "Unquoted $* and $@ are undefined; DO NOT use." to the factoid. am i misinterpreting the spec? they seem to be explicitly defined, what is unspecified is stuff like "a $@" 
[17:53:17] <greycat> Undefined may not be technically true.  What's true in the real world is it's full of bugs and the results are unpredictable across real-world shells.
[17:53:28] <kurahaupo> emanuele6: "undefined" is a poor choice of word; "very strongly discouraged" would be better
[17:53:33] <greycat> !unquoted
[17:53:33] <greybot> Unquoted $@ and $* give unspecified behavior (as far as we can tell). Always quote them. A partial list of various unquoted behaviors by shell is here: http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/pe#bugs_and_portability_considerations
[17:54:00] <emanuele6> i see
[17:54:39] <kurahaupo> The behaviour is defined and specified, but it will be unpredictable in the sense that the reader often won't know enough to say for certain what will happen
[17:54:45] <pystardust> geirha: where can i find the decription of what each of those commands do? like for example vi-column is bound to pipe, i wanna know what it does
[17:54:52] <greycat> man bash

[17:56:57] <kurahaupo> (where n99,99 is a string of digits not starting with 0)
[17:57:41] <kurahaupo> 1| is equivalent to ^ and 999999| is roughly equivalent to $
[17:57:59] <greycat> 1| is equivalent to 0, not ^
[17:58:06] <pystardust> ah got it, :)
[17:58:21] <kurahaupo> greycat: point taken. ^ skips leading spaces
[17:58:27] <greycat> ^ moves to the first non-whitespace character, and 0 moves to column 1
[17:58:55] <xx> 'case $var in' *never* needs quoting the "$var", but what about 'for i in $var'? Can I also *never* quoute the "$var"?
[17:59:06] <kurahaupo> I'm not in the habit of indenting lines that I type into a shell prompt
[17:59:06] <pystardust> is there a way we can traverse the nth argument, i do 0<n>w, where <n> is the argument, but this doesn't work for quoted args
[17:59:15] <greycat> if you don't quote $var in that one, you get word splitting and globbing

[22:24:26] * LuksNuke is confused
[22:24:45] <greycat> the fundamental problem here is that you shouldn't be using the / or // operator at all, because you are trying to remove content from the start of a string, not from the middle.
[22:24:58] <Soliton> either you match at the start or you match multiple times. both makes no sense.
[22:25:03] *** panda_man is now known as koala_man
[22:25:34] <greycat> what we're perceiving as the // operator is not really a // operator at all.  it's a / operator where the first character of the "before" string happens to be "/", which has a special meaning.  so you can't also have the first character be "#" which has special meaning too.  it's one or the other.
