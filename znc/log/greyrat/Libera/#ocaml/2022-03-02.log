[12:31:18] <gopiandcode> trying to compile some stuff on a freebsd machine - hosting service doesn't provide root, so I have to compile everything from scratch, can't use pkg install etc.
[12:31:35] <gopiandcode> managed to get opam up and running with a 4.12.0 switch
[12:32:04] <gopiandcode> but now, one of the packages I'm installing requires libev, and I'm stuck
[12:32:31] <gopiandcode> I've downloaded the ports of libev and compiled it, so now I have a libev.so file
[12:32:53] <gopiandcode> but no root, so I can't place it under /lib/
[12:33:55] <gopiandcode> how can I tell opam to look for shared libraries in a particular directory?
[12:34:09] <gopiandcode> is it just by export LIBRARY/LD_LIBRARY_PATH?

[12:37:51] <d_bot_> <orbitz> gopiandcode: For compiling I think you'llneed LIBRARY
[12:38:08] <d_bot_> <orbitz> But: surely there are hosts that let you install things?
[12:39:20] <gopiandcode> It's a pretty barebones hosting provider, so the hosting service comes with a few languages (php, python, go) and libraries, but not much else, and no root
[12:39:50] <d_bot_> <orbitz> Sure, but there are plenty of hosting provides out there
[12:40:03] <d_bot_> <orbitz> I compile on sr.ht which provides FreeBSD build environments, for example
[12:43:28] <hannes> gopiandcode: I'd guess you need to pass -L ~/libs -I ~/include (or where you installed the libev) to OCaml -- so whenever it calls out to a C compiler or linker it adds the paths
[12:44:00] <gopiandcode> yes, maybe, if need be I can swap to another hosting provider, but I'd like to leave that as a last option - my hosting provider serves my main website (which is just a static page: gopiandcode.uk) very well, and I found that they also offer some basic VPS-like service, so for doing some small web-service experiments, I'd rather not go through the hassle of creating an account on a separate provider
[12:44:47] <gopiandcode> hannes: right, I figured that would need to be done somewhere down the pipeline at the point where the OCaml compiler is run, but is there a way to do it from opam?
[12:45:01] <gopiandcode> opam install -L ~/libs -I ~/include dream?
[12:49:34] <theblatte> gopiandcode: do you need to pass it to the build or it builds fine but fails to execute?
[12:56:01] <hannes> gopiandcode: I am not aware of an opam solution. What I know is that the OCaml compiler calls out to cc/ld, and in OCaml's configure step you can set the flags used (also reported by ocamlc -config) -> TL;DR: a CFLAGS=-Lfoo ./configure should (may) do the trick ;)
[12:59:02] <gopiandcode> hannes: update, ran into a problem before that, mirage-crypto fails to build on freebsd? in particular, the dune file in src-freestanding calls out to make, but the freebsd's make rejects the makefile (gnu make works however?)
[13:00:44] <hannes> gopiandcode: the issue is that dune in version 3 (< 3.0.3) does not work well on FreeBSD (see https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/5470)
[13:01:09] <hannes> but gladly 3.0.3 is on the publish queue https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/20829
[13:02:25] <gopiandcode> ah, I see, good to hear that it's already been queued to be fixed!
[13:03:06] <gopiandcode> in the meanwhile is the best option to just clone the mirage-crypto library locally and pin it?
[13:07:04] <hannes> gopiandcode: maybe pin dune, maybe opam install dune<3.0
[13:08:05] <gopiandcode> hannes: ah, thanks, yep, that's a much better idea
[13:09:59] <gopiandcode> yup, I'm having a bunch of packages (bigstringaf, digestif) fail because of the dune issue, so pinning dune is definitely going to save some time
[13:12:26] *** Joins: olle (~olle@i5E866D9C.versanet.de)
[13:13:10] <gopiandcode> theblatte: hadn't got round to actually building it, pre-emptively asked the question because I figured libev wouldn't be present, good point - I guess if it's a shared library, it might be the case that the compile won't fail (although maybe might fail because of missing include files)
[13:13:34] <gopiandcode> will follow up once I finish recompiling dune, and the 100 packages that have to be recompiled as a result

[20:36:38] <d_bot_> <Butanium (@me on reply)> oh ok it's because I had 2 comments I think
[20:37:26] <d_bot_> <khady> also yes if you have somehow misplaced comments you'll see to which node it is really attached
[20:37:57] <d_bot_> <Butanium (@me on reply)> ok it's because I had to comments in a row
[20:38:13] <d_bot_> <Butanium (@me on reply)> ocamlformat thinks it's an entity not attached to any type
[20:38:31] <d_bot_> <Butanium (@me on reply)> but actually it's because I didn't want to put the english and french comment in one comment
[20:39:12] <d_bot_> <Butanium (@me on reply)> https://pastebin.com/5etqnuA4
[20:39:39] <d_bot_> <Butanium (@me on reply)> for example in this case it prefers having a space between type declaration and comment
