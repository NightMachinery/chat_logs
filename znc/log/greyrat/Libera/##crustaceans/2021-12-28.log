[00:00:10] <manicennui> I think I could deal with most aspects of camping other than the bathroom situation really.
[00:00:23] <gwozniak> My wife and I go what we call "car camping" at least once a year.  We get a site at an Ontario park, drive in, setup the tent and hang out there for a few days
[00:00:28] <dminkovsky> gwozniak: do you remember in The Age of Surveillance Capitalism whether she actually gives examples of what these behavioral futures markets are
[00:00:30] <gwozniak> That's typically our vacation
[00:00:50] <gwozniak> dminkovsky: I don't remember.  I'll try to jog my memory
[00:00:52] <dminkovsky> gwozniak: i'm half way through and impatiently wondering if all she means is AdWords
[00:01:15] <dminkovsky> the book would be better if she it was like half as long, less FUD-y with more details
[00:01:26] <dminkovsky> by omitting details she comes up as FUD-y
[00:01:30] <dminkovsky> comes off*
[00:01:33] <gwozniak> Yes, it could certainly be a shorter book
[00:01:52] <dminkovsky> "logic of accumulation" is a phrase she could, like, use less
[00:02:13] <gwozniak> I think it has some really solid points, but tends to be very full of rhetorical flourishes, better suited to speeches
[00:02:17] <dminkovsky> if you google the phrase you don't get much, yet she uses it constantly
[00:02:30] <dminkovsky> yeah i agree it's definitely very solid
[00:02:43] <dminkovsky> and clear, despite the verbosity and repetitiveness
[00:02:48] <gwozniak> yeah
[00:04:51] <dminkovsky> anyway looking forward if she explains what she is concretely referring to by "behavioral futures markets" beyond AdWords
[00:05:01] <dminkovsky> i mean, where can i go buy human behavior?
[00:05:04] <dminkovsky> pokemon go?
[00:05:12] <dminkovsky> muchless behavioral futures
[00:14:42] <gwozniak> dminkovsky: I think auto insurance was another example
[00:14:52] <gwozniak> Chinese social credit is another
[00:16:29] <manicennui> I wonder whether being anti-vax loses you some social credit in China.
[00:17:05] <manicennui> They probably don't have as much problem with such things anyways.
[00:17:19] <manicennui> Surely there are some crazies though.
[00:20:22] <manicennui> Google cannot calculate directions from me to Moscow.
[00:20:34] <manicennui> Surely there is a ferry.
[00:20:38] <gwozniak> I blame Putin
[00:21:06] <dminkovsky> gwozniak: interesting i look forward to encountering them
[00:22:15] <manicennui> Also won't give me directions to Buenos Aires.
[00:22:21] <gwozniak> dminkovsky: I don't know if she explicitly lists them as examples, but they are examples of it that are described in the book
[00:22:36] <manicennui> Is there a gap that can't be crossed between here and South America?
[00:23:09] <gwozniak> manicennui: thanks for pointing me to Benn Jordan video, because I made my way to The Flashbulb and that seems like a good set of albums to buy
[00:23:31] <manicennui> gwozniak: Yeah, his music seems like it would appeal to programmers.
[00:24:03] * manicennui is now watching videos about monster off-road vehicles.
[00:24:07] <gwozniak> I've been into more ambient stuff of late, and my wife likes it too, so I expect I'll buy the entire discography
[00:24:44] <manicennui> gwozniak: If you are into audio engineering and sound sampling and such, his Benn Jordan channel seems really good.
[00:25:29] <gwozniak> My days are already full of stuff to do, so I generally don't watch YouTube stuff, but if I'm bored, I'll check it out
[00:26:36] <manicennui> I identify with Johnny 5. Need input.
[00:27:01] <manicennui> I have no need to know all this stuff.
[00:27:21] <gwozniak> Do you have a Fisher Stevens-type friend to help you navigate the world?
[00:27:31] <manicennui> I do not.
[00:28:04] <gwozniak> I did not really grasp how cringy that character was until years later
[00:28:20] <manicennui> Yeah, I thought he was actually Indian when I saw it .
[00:28:39] <gwozniak> Like, as a middle-schooler, I thought Soul Man was inoffensive and mildly funny
[00:28:45] <manicennui> I really love Short Circuit though.
[00:28:52] <manicennui> I wish we made movies like that still.
[00:28:55] <gwozniak> I have a soft spot for it
[00:29:07] <manicennui> Especially the part in Short Circuit 2 where he is dying.
[00:29:08] <manicennui> OMG
[00:29:23] <manicennui> "We need a hero!"
[00:29:28] <gwozniak> They did a good job of making the robot a likable character, that's for sure
[00:29:50] <manicennui> I guess it's, "I need a hero!"
[00:29:53] <manicennui> "I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night"
[00:30:13] <manicennui> Not really the same thing, but I really enjoy Chappie too.
[00:30:30] <manicennui> There are definitely a lot of similarities.
[00:30:35] <gwozniak> I liked Chappie
[00:31:03] <manicennui> And instead of Fisher Stevens, Chappie has Die Antwoord.
[00:31:46] <manicennui> They basically take on the role of Ally Sheedy and the gang that Johnny 5 meets in SC2.
[00:32:18] <manicennui> Hugh Jackman replaces the evil head of security.
[00:32:53] <manicennui> I guess the Indian guy is actually the Fisher Stevens.
[00:33:05] <manicennui> Dev Patel
[00:33:11] <manicennui> Can't believe I didn't remember that it was him.
[00:35:36] <manicennui> "On September 27, 2020, during an interview on a Zoom call with Norm Macdonald, Guttenberg confirmed that filming had begun on an eighth Police Academy film. He confirmed that his character was returning, and was using a wheelchair, having lost his foot in the line of duty."
[00:38:31] <gwozniak> uh....
[00:55:32] <dminkovsky> eigth police academy
[00:55:34] <dminkovsky> wow
[00:55:44] <dminkovsky> i watched police academy 1 like 1,000 times as a child
[00:58:15] <Brekkjern> I remember having watched some of them. I don't think I believed they needed much more than the 3 or so that I knew of though....
[01:01:47] <manicennui> I always thought Michael Winslow was amazing growing up.
[01:01:54] <manicennui> Love his bit in Spaceballs.

[01:03:22] <manicennui> The part where he puts down the handset and still makes the handset noise is hilarious.
[01:04:54] <manicennui> Mel Brooks is so damn great.
[01:18:58] <Brekkjern> True
[01:19:08] <Brekkjern> Robin Hood: Men In Tights is hilarious too
[01:19:11] <Brekkjern> I love that movie
[01:20:08] <manicennui> I want to see Blazing Saddles again. Haven't seen it in a long time.
[01:20:19] <Brekkjern> I haven't seen that one
[01:20:31] <manicennui> And I've actually never seen Young Frankenstein and The Producers.
[01:20:32] <Brekkjern> I've heard it's good, but I just never sat down to watch it
[01:20:38] <manicennui> And I really like Gene Wilder.
[01:20:48] <manicennui> Brekkjern: I think you'll find it surprising how "woke" it is.
[01:20:56] <Brekkjern> I've seen a few clips
[01:20:59] <manicennui> Based on when it was made.

[01:24:50] <manicennui> Super cute!
[01:26:55] <dminkovsky> awww
[01:26:58] <dminkovsky> i love those guys

[01:33:42] <dminkovsky> what's everyone up to this evening
[01:40:57] <ngoldbaum> drinking the blood of my enemies
[01:42:06] <manicennui> Eating an entire bag of Hi-Chew
[01:45:22] <dminkovsky> People also ask: Is Hi-Chew addictive
[01:46:13] <ngoldbaum> nicotine hi-chew
[01:46:35] <manicennui> Fruity chewy candy is my biggest vice.

[01:46:42] <buttsbot> Myself when I'm real - Charles Mingus - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCK6Feqz7wY&lc=UggabTwKTGmsYXgCoAEC
[01:46:59] <dminkovsky> i like that track a lot but
[01:47:09] <dminkovsky> "makes me weep every single time"?
[01:47:15] <dminkovsky> weep?
[01:49:00] <dminkovsky> i would probably avoid listening to something that made me weep every time i heard it
[01:49:07] <dminkovsky> that would be too much for me
[01:49:10] <manicennui> I like crying.
[01:49:24] <manicennui> I have to be in the right mood though.
[01:49:40] <dminkovsky> hey i'm not trying to cry-shame here
[01:50:05] <manicennui> What I really enjoy is art that evokes an extreme emotional reaction in me.
[01:50:10] <Brekkjern> Same
[01:50:13] <manicennui> But if I'm not in the right mood, it doesn't happen.
[01:50:21] <dminkovsky> spot the error `find . -type d -iname '%mingus%'`
[01:50:26] <dminkovsky> :(
[01:50:27] <manicennui> Using find.
[01:50:41] <dminkovsky> find is fine if you're on a volume where spotlight is disabled
[01:51:16] <dminkovsky> ppl shit on mac os/apple getting worse and worse but in my day to day the only thing that has gotten markedly worse all these years is spotlight
[01:51:24] <dminkovsky> mdfind still works out, but the spotlight UI is crap
[01:51:31] <manicennui> Eh.
[01:51:33] <dminkovsky> non-responsive
[01:51:52] <manicennui> Some of us used OS X during a period when every release got noticeably better.
[01:51:53] <dminkovsky> " < manicennui> Using find." what should i use?
[01:52:02] <manicennui> Now they add a bunch of features that many of us couldn't care less about.
[01:52:14] <manicennui> And its performance stays the same or gets worse.
[01:52:25] <dminkovsky> spotlight has become fucked
[01:52:32] <dminkovsky> there's no other way of putting it
[01:52:38] <manicennui> dminkovsky: fd obviously.
[01:52:41] <dminkovsky> opening spotlight gives me more anxiety than photofshop
[01:52:50] <dminkovsky> photoshop opens quite fast, in fact
[01:52:59] <dminkovsky> not familiar with fd
[01:53:01] <manicennui> I was reading a discussion about BeOS and its filesystem yesterday. Tracker sounds amazing.
[01:53:13] <dminkovsky> https://github.com/sharkdp/fd
[01:53:14] <buttsbot> GitHub - sharkdp/fd: A simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to 'find'
[01:53:28] <manicennui> Apparently its filesystem had something similar to spotlight, but in the kernel, and far better.
[01:53:39] <dminkovsky> "Ignores patterns from your .gitignore, by default."
[01:53:41] <dminkovsky> that's awesome
[01:53:42] <manicennui> And Tracker could be used to create a saved search that looked like a directory.
[01:53:55] <dminkovsky> there should be an "Awesome" list of things that respect .gitignore/.ignore
[01:54:10] <Brekkjern> Speaking of songs that evoke emotions, it is probably a toss up of these two for me:
[01:54:10] <Brekkjern> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omgSWqwVTjY

[01:54:19] <manicennui> So you could do things like use Tracker for a photo or mp3 organizer with amazing metadata.
[01:54:35] <dminkovsky> shit it's written in rust too
[01:54:44] <dminkovsky> how can they RiiR if it's already in R?
[01:54:57] <dminkovsky> they could rewrite it anyway?
[01:56:33] <dminkovsky> youtube in a private tab + vpn still seems to know who i am
[01:56:40] <dminkovsky> give me a break google
[01:56:53] <dminkovsky> i don't have any other google apps open
[01:56:59] <dminkovsky> how did i leak
[01:57:40] <Brekkjern> Good question
[02:01:00] <manicennui> https://www.reddit.com/r/houseplants/comments/rps2ax/thinks_he_is_hilarious_knocking_a_few_plants_over/
[02:01:01] <buttsbot> Thinks he is hilarious knocking a few plants over today 😵‍💫 : houseplants
[02:01:03] <manicennui> But look how cute!
[02:05:31] <manicennui> "Social media is just a lavatory wall."
[02:07:04] <Brekkjern> I guess
[02:12:02] <dminkovsky> it is
[02:12:38] <manicennui> Brekkjern: I always forget whether you are from Sweden or Norway.
[02:12:56] <manicennui> I'm watching Stephen Fry on Skavlan.
[02:13:10] <manicennui> "Skavlan is a Norwegian-Swedish television talk show"
[02:13:14] <manicennui> What does that mean exactly?
[02:13:35] <manicennui> I assume it airs in both countries, but I'm not sure what that means exactly.
[02:13:37] <Brekkjern> He's Norwegian and the show was jointly produced between Norwegian and Swedish state broadcasters IIRC
[02:13:51] <Brekkjern> I'm Norwegian btw
[02:14:02] <manicennui> Ah.
[02:14:05] <Brekkjern> gerikson is the resident swede
[02:14:28] <manicennui> This is far more intelligent than anything on American television
[02:14:42] <manicennui> Mostly because they just let Fry talk for like 10 minutes at a time.
[02:14:48] <Brekkjern> He got rather popular across the world
[02:15:18] <manicennui> Some UK and European talk shows remind me of American talk shows from decades ago.
[02:15:27] <Brekkjern> Mhm
[02:15:35] <manicennui> I wonder why that is.
[02:15:44] <manicennui> Is entertainment just that different in Europe?
[02:15:51] <Brekkjern> I don't think it is
[02:15:54] <manicennui> I know our crap is super popular there.
[02:16:36] <manicennui> You all do murder mystery far better too.
[02:16:56] <Brekkjern> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[02:16:56] <Brekkjern> :P
[02:17:17] <Brekkjern> I got tired of murder mystery books back in secondary school, so I haven't kept up
[02:17:32] <imode>  mainframes didn't suck, their client experiences did.
[02:17:45] <manicennui> I have watched quite a few British murder mystery shows, and British remakes of Nordic shows.
[02:17:48] <manicennui> Wallander is great.
[02:18:00] <manicennui> imode: We are working our way back to mainframes.
[02:18:07] <Brekkjern> I haven't seen the shows, but I did read a lot of Wallander books
[02:18:16] <Brekkjern> That is what eventually made me grow tired of it :P
[02:18:36] <dminkovsky> good evening imode
[02:18:43] <dminkovsky> or, afternoon where you are
[02:18:50] <imode> allo.
[02:18:50] <Brekkjern> It's a lot of the same "semi-alcoholic detective with family issues solving gruesome murders" trope
[02:18:51] <dminkovsky> afternoon here too, i gues,s for that matter
[02:18:54] <manicennui> imode: But this time you won't own the hardware. Amazon will.
[02:18:58] <imode> manicennui: yeh
[02:19:23] <imode> dminkovsky: it dumped 8in of snow recently. feels like home.
[02:19:33] <dminkovsky> that's awesome
[02:21:30] <Brekkjern> manicennui: I mean... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-OOpZitfd0
[02:21:30] <buttsbot> Every Single Scandinavian Crime Drama - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-OOpZitfd0
[02:21:40] <manicennui> I love that guy
[02:21:50] <manicennui> I wonder whether you shared one of his videos long ago.
[02:22:07] <Brekkjern> I think that's the only video of his I've seen TBH
[02:22:20] <manicennui> Ah
[02:22:22] <manicennui> That one is great.
[02:22:48] <manicennui> People are definitely much calmer in British/European murder mysteries.
[02:23:05] <manicennui> If it were American, there would have to be more denial and a chase scene.
[02:23:13] <Brekkjern> And gunfights
[02:23:25] <Brekkjern> I love how Hot Fuzz takes the piss on all that :P
[02:23:35] <manicennui> Yeah, great movie.
[02:24:04] <manicennui> My favorite Edgar Write movie, and favorite movie with those two actors.

[02:33:37] <Brekkjern> I am so glad The Expanse doesn't fall for that...
[02:34:30] <manicennui> It is mostly based on the books, and the authors are involved in the show.
[02:34:35] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[02:34:51] <Brekkjern> I need to read the last book, but I'm in the middle of another series...
[02:34:58] <manicennui> Arguably the fourth season is kind of that thought.
[02:35:00] <manicennui> Just not with aliens.
[02:35:06] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[02:35:12] <Brekkjern> But that book is pretty weak too though
[02:35:55] <manicennui> I'm just not terribly interested in the whole terrorist plot now.
[02:36:50] <Brekkjern> It was done better in the books IMO
[02:37:07] <Brekkjern> The actor that plays Inaros isn't quite as charismatic as the one in the book
[02:37:44] <manicennui> I just really loved the sense of wonder and mystery in the first three seasons.
[02:37:50] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[02:37:55] <Brekkjern> The books are immensely better at that
[02:38:12] <Brekkjern> Like, even the fourth book is rather decent at that
[02:38:26] <Brekkjern> I think it was the fourth book?
[02:38:29] <manicennui> Yeah, the alien tech stuff in the fourth season was pretty weak.
[02:38:48] <manicennui> Super tropey.
[02:38:55] <Brekkjern> Mhm
[02:39:32] <Brekkjern> The crew dynamics got kinda wonky after Alex got removed from the series too
[02:56:50] <indigo> Peaches!
[02:57:39] <indigo> Anyone watched No Time To Die yet?
[02:57:56] <indigo> About to rent it; hopefully it’s better than the new Matrix
[02:59:46] <imode> anything is better than that dumpster fire.
[03:00:35] <imode> we watched "The Tale Of Princess Kaguya" and that was a better time investment by a long mile.
[03:00:46] <manicennui> I don't really watch new blockbusters until they are on streaming these days, and even then I rarely do.
[03:09:18] <Church> indigo: Alright movie
[03:09:18] <manicennui> I think I'm completely done with the MCU.
[03:09:24] <Church> Finally got a good Bond quip
[03:09:25] <manicennui> Haven't seen anything since End Game.
[03:10:57] <indigo> Shang Chi wasn’t bad

[03:29:20] <skyl4rk> drakonis: how did you reach that conclusion?
[03:29:55] <drakonis> so much drama
[03:30:08] <drakonis> shitty people
[03:32:49] <dminkovsky> it is a commonly known fact that scala was used by IBM to deport jews, communists and homosexuals to the death camps
[03:33:04] <dminkovsky> they considered haskell but

[04:47:56] <Brekkjern> The dumbest things you spend time on...
[04:48:20] <Brekkjern> I wrote a piece of code to find the optimal price to put things onto the flea market in Escape From Tarkov...
[04:52:52] <imode> there are more stupid things to spend time on.
[04:53:12] <Brekkjern> Well, true, but there are only a few items where this makes sense at all
[04:53:25] <manicennui> At some point in the future the virtual economy will probably be larger than the real one.
[04:53:49] <manicennui> When we are all drinking Brawndo and playing video games all day.
[04:54:12] <Brekkjern> Also, this is the fucking algorithm that determines the fees to put something onto the market: VO × Ti × 4^PO × Q + VR × Tr × 4^PR × Q
[04:54:20] <imode> plants crave it.
[04:54:31] <Brekkjern> It sounds simple enough, but there are a bunch of gotchas in the variables too...
[04:55:42] <Brekkjern> >PO is a modifier calculated as log10(VO / VR).
[04:55:42] <Brekkjern> >If VR is less than VO then PO is also raised to the power of 1.08.
[04:55:57] <manicennui> imode: I think he posted an update but it was pulled?

[04:56:39] <buttsbot> Not a Creature was Stirring : antiwork
[04:56:43] <imode> Brekkjern: but why not machine learning.
[04:56:54] <Brekkjern> lolno
[04:56:57] <indigo> companion_cube: it’s worse (matrix film)
[04:57:24] <indigo> Brekkjern: did you rewrite it in Rust
[04:57:31] <imode> companion_cube: watch it. seriously, watch it.
[04:57:35] <Brekkjern> indigo: also lolno

[04:57:38] <manicennui> indigo: Yeah, I can't read it.
[04:57:49] <Brekkjern> I used Python, because no step on snek
[04:59:00] <Brekkjern> Magic numbers all over the place :P
[04:59:49] <manicennui> imode rather
[05:01:14] <manicennui> Sounds like they are spamming his family with calls?
[05:01:58] <indigo> Brekkjern: seems well organized to me. Nice!!
[05:02:38] <Brekkjern> indigo: It's OK. I'm not too much of a fan of the way I find the optimum price though...
[05:02:50] <Brekkjern> I mean...
[05:02:51] <Brekkjern> res = max([(x, prft(x), fee(proposed_price=x)) for x in range(150_000, 275_000)], key=itemgetter(1))
[05:02:53] <Brekkjern> lol
[05:03:12] <Brekkjern> There has to be a better way than that...
[05:03:32] <imode> like what.
[05:04:05] <Brekkjern> Dunno. I bet one could rework the formula and find it as an unknown?
[05:04:19] <Brekkjern> But this is outside the scope of my math abilities at 2:30 AM...
[05:04:44] <indigo> Gradient descent?
[05:05:09] <Brekkjern> I guess, but this is a parabolic function really
[05:05:31] <Brekkjern> At some point the fees outweigh the increase in price
[05:05:41] <Brekkjern> And I need to know what to put in as the price
[05:06:01] <Brekkjern> So essentially, this just automates trying all the numbers and finds the best one..
[05:06:36] <indigo> How long does it take to run?
[05:06:49] <Brekkjern> It also runs the offer_fee twice per attempt...
[05:07:07] <Brekkjern> Short enough that it is pointless to optimize
[05:07:17] <Brekkjern> Like... a couple seconds :P
[05:07:18] <imode> phrase it as a generator.
[05:07:56] <companion_cube> imode: I watched it
[05:08:02] <companion_cube> and I don't know if I find it worse
[05:08:09] <companion_cube> (except for a scene that's just… no)
[05:08:28] <Brekkjern> imode: I probably could, but I don't see the point really
[05:08:48] <Brekkjern> I just have this feeling that it should be possible to do this without brute forcing the number
[05:09:50] <imode> well, notice that you're generating the collection before you take the max of it.
[05:10:00] <imode> so that's already two passes.
[05:10:32] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[05:10:55] <imode> phrasing it as a generator can allow you to take the max at a particular point while rolling through the data points.
[05:11:12] <imode> or just.. do it in a loop, I guess?
[05:11:14] <Brekkjern> True
[05:11:20] <Brekkjern> Either works :P
[05:11:32] <imode> just if you want it faster.
[05:12:25] <Brekkjern> I could also remove a couple things from the fee function, plus not run it twice for each value...
[05:12:34] <imode> so you're generating a triple of some `x`, your profit `prft(x)`, and the fee.. and you want the item that represents your max profit.
[05:12:46] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[05:13:02] <imode> what's `prft` look like.
[05:13:13] <Brekkjern> prft = partial(profit, base_price=item_base_price, quantity=1)
[05:13:22] <imode> what's `partial`.
[05:13:26] <Brekkjern> functools
[05:13:52] <Brekkjern> It returns a new function with some arguments already filled
[05:13:57] <imode> ah.
[05:14:01] <imode> what's `profit`.
[05:14:08] <Brekkjern> def profit(proposed_price: int, base_price: float, quantity: int) -> float:
[05:14:08] <Brekkjern>     return proposed_price - offer_fee(base_price, proposed_price, quantity)
[05:14:18] <Brekkjern> Which could be calculated on the fly...
[05:14:34] <imode> that it could.
[05:14:38] <imode> what's `offer_fee` look like.
[05:14:54] <Brekkjern> I was more interested in making it work and testing it than to make it efficient and pretty
[05:14:58] <Brekkjern> offer_fee is on line 24
[05:15:08] <Brekkjern> And 18 lines long
[05:15:19] <imode> oh shit I forgot you pasted it.
[05:15:33] <Brekkjern> :p
[05:15:41] <imode> didn't even see it.
[05:16:00] <manicennui> imode: Someone in the comments linked directly to the original images. This is great.
[05:16:35] <imode> it doesn't seem like this needs to be a particularly complicated bit of math.
[05:16:40] <imode> unpack the logic here.
[05:16:47] <manicennui> Manager's response seems pretty typical.
[05:17:56] <imode> the dominating terms are the exponential ones, which makes sense because they're the ones directly affected by whether the proposed price outweighs the price you'd pay to get the items directly.
[05:18:15] <manicennui> I wish people could name and shame these companies, but I understand why it can't happen.
[05:18:17] <imode> so maybe there's some simpler choice logic here that'll give you the same result.
[05:18:33] <Brekkjern> I should honestly plot the result when I think about it..
[05:19:09] <imode> yeah, that's a good way to sus out patterns, and I imagine the rest of the terms fall away on a long enough axis.
[05:19:12] <Brekkjern> Since there's no guarantee that the market prices fall into a range where the optimum is
[05:21:27] <Brekkjern> I should sit down with this tomorrow and learn numpy and matplotlib and see if I can't make something decent out of this
[05:21:58] <imode> well, you can probably just plug it all into some online matlab runner or something.
[05:22:27] <Brekkjern> Maybe
[05:23:08] <Brekkjern> Though the question fairly quickly becomes "How much of a shit do I actually give?" :P
[05:24:06] <imode> you cared enough to write it. :P
[05:24:21] <Brekkjern> Yeah... And I spent about an hour figuring it out.
[05:24:33] <Brekkjern> Netted me about 20k more profit than I was planning on :P
[05:24:53] <Brekkjern> Which... is about 5 minutes of gameplay assuming I get out of the raid without dying...
[05:25:03] <Brekkjern> Maybe even less...
[05:29:36] <manicennui> WTF. Netflix has fireplace videos now...
[05:29:46] <Brekkjern> They've had them for a while
[05:29:47] <dminkovsky> they've had those for real
[05:29:50] <dminkovsky> erm, for a long time
[05:29:52] <dminkovsky> yeah
[05:29:55] <manicennui> Why?
[05:29:58] <dminkovsky> christmas
[05:30:06] <manicennui> Are they trying to compete with YT?
[05:30:08] <dminkovsky> ever heard of it ;)
[05:30:29] <dminkovsky> why think of it as competition?
[05:30:30] <Brekkjern> Trying to boost their watchtime numbers I guess?
[05:30:57] <dminkovsky> i think at this point not having fireplace vids is a liability
[05:30:57] <Brekkjern> AFAIK, Netflix calculates popularity of their shows based on how many hours their users spend watching them
[05:30:57] <manicennui> Brekkjern: Stupid me. I didn't even think of the scummy business angle.
[05:31:05] <dminkovsky> like what, are you part of the war on christmas, bro?
[05:31:20] <manicennui> dminkovsky: I just don't understand why Netflix needs to have what are basically screensavers.
[05:31:43] <Brekkjern> They need something to test the "Are you still watching?" feature :P
[05:31:46] <manicennui> Do they have those lofi animations with music too?
[05:32:04] <dminkovsky> lofi animations of what
[05:32:13] <dminkovsky> their fireplaces are 4k i'm sure
[05:32:13] <Brekkjern> lol
[05:32:17] <manicennui> dminkovsky: It's a thing on YT.
[05:32:23] <dminkovsky> oh i don't know those
[05:32:27] <manicennui> Doesn't refer to image quality
[05:32:38] <manicennui> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A
[05:32:38] <buttsbot> lofi hip hop radio - beats to relax/study to - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A
[05:32:46] <Brekkjern> I was just about to paste that :P
[05:34:41] <dminkovsky> why is this "lofi"?
[05:34:52] <Brekkjern> Beats me
[05:35:17] <manicennui> dminkovsky: It is "chill".
[05:35:25] <manicennui> Something along those lines.
[05:35:31] <manicennui> I don't know the origins.
[05:35:47] <manicennui> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lofi_hip_hop
[05:35:47] <buttsbot> Lofi hip hop - Wikipedia
[05:35:56] <manicennui> Lofi hip hop (also known as chillhop and lofi beats to study to[2]) is a form of downtempo[3][4] that combines elements of hip hop and chill-out music.[5]

[05:36:22] <buttsbot> Dozing off ... - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYSrlygyhi4
[05:37:23] <manicennui> Actually kind of surprised Netflix doesn't do lofi.
[05:37:39] <manicennui> They could have some original art and music made.
[05:37:45] <manicennui> Crank up their viewing hours.
[05:37:53] <manicennui> Should be super cheap to make.
[05:37:58] <Brekkjern> I honestly believe it's because nobody has actually produced it...
[05:38:00] <imode> doesn't matter if it's all shit.
[05:38:20] <manicennui> Why does the quality matter?
[05:38:22] <Brekkjern> People have this stuff on in the background. Doesn't have to be great if you are just using it as a radio.
[05:38:23] <manicennui> People obviously don't care.
[05:38:53] <imode> I care.
[05:39:02] <manicennui> Yes, but companies don't care about you.
[05:39:08] <imode> I am not a minority.
[05:39:20] <Brekkjern> Also, most people don't seem to give a flying fuck about quality. The video compression in Netflix movies/series shows that...
[05:39:32] <imode> video quality? if I can make it out, it's fine.
[05:39:40] <imode> so you're on the ball.
[05:39:49] <Brekkjern> The compression artifacts drives me nuts :(
[05:40:06] <manicennui> Netflix's content strategy is already "throw a bunch of random shit again the wall and see what sticks".
[05:40:14] *** Quits: art_vandelay (~art_vande@142.126.234.156) (Quit: Textual IRC Client: www.textualapp.com)
[05:40:25] <Brekkjern> I love the stuff that sticks though :P
[05:40:33] <imode> I don't. I don't watch Netflix.
[05:40:42] <manicennui> Their movies are usually pretty bad.
[05:40:45] <imode> you're talking about netflix authoring new music streams.
[05:40:52] <manicennui> imode: Yes.
[05:40:53] <imode> I care about quality, so do a lot of people.
[05:40:58] <manicennui> Not because I want them to.
[05:41:03] <manicennui> But because it will give them views.
[05:41:10] <manicennui> Like the fucking fireplace video.
[05:41:10] <imode> meh. it won't last if they do it.
[05:41:17] <manicennui> Last?
[05:41:25] <imode> last. you know, survive a year.
[05:41:29] <imode> maybe less.
[05:41:30] <manicennui> They can make a few and then forget about them. Doesn't cost them anything to keep them around.
[05:41:47] <imode> and yet it won't get them views.
[05:41:52] <Brekkjern> I've liked a few of their series. Arcane, The Witcher, Castlevania, Umbrella Academy, Altered Carbon (just the first season), Love + Death + Robots...
[05:42:05] <imode> rather it won't draw in consistent views.
[05:42:15] <imode> part of a traveling circus is that you need a routine audience.
[05:42:17] <Brekkjern> Shadow and Bone was decent too.
[05:42:37] <manicennui> Their series are quite a bit better than their movies, but they have a hard time doing more than one or maybe two good seasons of a show.
[05:42:51] <manicennui> And there is a ton of really bad shit too.
[05:43:03] <manicennui> Like that series with the idiots in space.
[05:43:22] <manicennui> Another Life
[05:43:33] <Brekkjern> Barbarians was cool. Pretty cool to see the Romans speak latin, and the Gauls speak German
[05:43:50] <manicennui> I *hate* when the studios do shows and movies with idiot scientists/astronauts/engineers.
[05:43:54] <Brekkjern> I think it was the Gauls... I can't remember...
[05:44:21] <manicennui> Who are super emotional and cause tons of problems that endanger lives.
[05:44:39] <Brekkjern> Yeah. I generally just avoid that kind of movie...
[05:44:58] <Brekkjern> It will just be a copy-paste of a TV Tropes page anyways.
[05:45:27] <manicennui> Barbarians was coproduced with Netflix.
[05:46:17] <manicennui> I think Netflix is a decent value, but I hate seeing trailers that look decent, and then the movie/show is just garbage.
[05:46:37] <imode> they need to stop being a content producer.
[05:46:52] <Brekkjern> Why?
[05:46:54] <manicennui> I was pretty disappointed by The Harder They Fall.
[05:47:03] <manicennui> imode: They have no choice now.
[05:47:04] <imode> because they aren't good at it.
[05:47:11] <manicennui> All of the studios are doing their own streaming services.
[05:47:13] <imode> strike deals with people making content.
[05:47:17] <manicennui> imode: Neither are the broadcast studios.
[05:47:38] <imode> which broadcast studios.
[05:47:39] <manicennui> imode: There is less of that available because of the studios' streaming services.
[05:47:54] <manicennui> imode: The ones who broadcast. NBC, ABC, CBS, Fox...
[05:48:15] <manicennui> Most of what they produce is absolute garbage, but people watch it.
[05:48:20] <manicennui> And once in a great while they manage to do something good.
[05:48:23] <imode> such as.
[05:48:51] <manicennui> The 15 CSI shows?
[05:49:05] <imode> "they manage to do something good"
[05:49:09] <manicennui> Nearly every sitcom?
[05:49:09] <imode> whaddabout these.
[05:49:19] <manicennui> Oh.
[05:49:19] <manicennui> The Good Life
[05:49:35] <manicennui> Sorry, The Good Place.
[05:49:37] <Brekkjern> Arcane was top tier. Easily one of the best series made this year.
[05:49:59] <Brekkjern> But I guess that wasn't really produced by Netflix...
[05:50:06] <manicennui> The Good Place and Firefly were both great.
[05:50:07] <imode> fwiw I don't watch TV anymore.
[05:50:21] <manicennui> imode: The Good Place is seriously good.
[05:50:24] <imode> pretty much after they stopped showing any good cartoons on, I stopped watching them.
[05:50:43] <imode> the channels, that is.
[05:50:43] <manicennui> They managed to sneak a philosophy overview on primetime television.
[05:50:51] <imode> meh.
[05:50:58] <manicennui> And it is funny.
[05:51:20] <imode> give me 1999-2008 era kids' TV any day.
[05:51:34] <manicennui> The first couple seasons of Hannibal are outstanding
[05:51:49] <imode> I'm not into Mads Mikkelsen.
[05:52:00] <Church> imode: Batman: Animated Series verse was good
[05:52:02] <imode> or people murdering other people creatively.
[05:52:06] <Church> So many good shows there
[05:52:13] <Brekkjern> If you wante a few suggestions, imode: Arcane, Generation Kill, Catch-22, Castlevania, Cowboy Bebop (the anime), Good Omens, Chernobyl, The Expanse.
[05:52:30] <Brekkjern> Hopefully there's something in that list you'd like :)
[05:52:31] <imode> seen chernobyl, watched 10 minutes of the expanse and shut it off.
[05:52:41] <imode> bebop is always good.
[05:53:13] <imode> I think the last "adult" TV show I enjoyed was True Detective's S1.
[05:53:20] <imode> maybe Billions up to a point
[05:53:31] <Brekkjern> What kind of shows do you enjoy then?
[05:53:37] <Brekkjern> Or, have enjoyed at least.
[05:53:57] <manicennui> I think you should hate watch Succession.
[05:54:02] <imode> not a whole lot, but I'm 26, I grew up at the beginning of the golden age of kids' TV.
[05:54:26] <imode> toonami was doing its thing, with that era being capped by ATLA's finale.
[05:54:29] <Brekkjern> imode: Well, I turned 31 a few days ago, and we got everything the US produced a few years after, so...
[05:54:39] <imode> ah, happy belated b-day.
[05:54:43] <Brekkjern> If you liked ATLA, then you might like Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood
[05:54:47] <Brekkjern> imode: Thanks :)
[05:54:53] <imode> seen brotherhood, well, a couple of episodes.
[05:55:02] <Brekkjern> The English dub is pretty good.
[05:55:09] <imode> I'll give it that, yeah.
[05:55:47] <Brekkjern> You might like The Dragon Prince, though the animation in the first season is lacklustre
[05:55:51] <imode> spongebob is always worth watching to me, at least within the first three or four seasons where the comedy is.
[05:55:55] <imode> ohoho I tried to get into that.
[05:55:57] <imode> it sucked ass.
[05:56:13] <Brekkjern> Hmm
[05:56:13] <manicennui> Venture Bros is great.
[05:56:21] <imode> because nearly every plot point was manufactured as if it were a D&D campaign. nearly everything happening happened because the protagonist didn't act.
[05:56:31] <imode> manicennui: damn straight.
[05:56:37] <Brekkjern> I can still recommend Castlevania. Also, One Punch Man is a lot of fun.
[05:56:46] <imode> aqua teen hunger force is a good go-to if I want to let my brain stop thinking.
[05:56:51] <Church> manicennui: Eat the pennies, quiz boy.
[05:57:19] <manicennui> Venture Bros might be my favorite American animated series.
[05:57:20] <Brekkjern> imode: Then turn off your brain for a season or two while watching Star Wars: The Clone Wars :) It gets really damn good towards the end.
[05:57:38] <imode> bruh I grew up with the OG clone wars.
[05:57:51] <imode> that was really something. that and samurai jack in the same vein.
[05:58:02] <imode> same producer/author/animator/whatever.
[05:58:06] <Brekkjern> Mhm
[05:58:26] <imode> lotta good stuff pumped out of animation studios during that era.
[05:58:28] <Brekkjern> I never saw Clone Wars, but the 3D one is rather good once it gets going.
[05:58:30] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[05:58:53] <manicennui> I really love the visuals of shows like Adventure Time, but I've never watched it.
[05:58:55] <imode> I put a couple TCW episodes on and actually enjoyed it, a lot of it is very well written.
[05:58:59] <manicennui> And Infinity Train.
[05:59:19] <imode> manicennui: AT has "lol randum" episodes and some episodes that make you sit down and think.
[05:59:26] <imode> which is always up my alley.
[06:00:03] <imode> regular show was also pretty good to just tune out to.
[06:00:45] <Brekkjern> imode: https://www.taste.io/users/brekkjern/ratings?category=tv&rating=4
[06:00:46] <buttsbot> @brekkjern's Ratings - Taste
[06:00:53] <imode> gumball was also pretty good, I'd call it CN's Spongebob because of how well it's written and paced most of the time. even commenting on current trends or drawing from popular culture, it didn't do some stupid wink-wink at the camera.
[06:01:04] <Brekkjern> That's the stuff I've liked a lot.
[06:01:28] <manicennui> There is an episode of Adventure Time called Abstract that has this amazing moment.
[06:01:52] <Church> Jake the Brick was great
[06:02:01] <Church> Actually Jake had a ton of artistic episodes heh
[06:02:16] <Church> Like that one where his hand is in a circus at night while he sleeps.
[06:03:11] <imode> any good show, like a good dish, needs a balance of comedy, progression, message and meaning. you need meaning to give the user something or someone to care about, a message for them to convey even if it's something vague or incomplete, progression to provide the ever-important build-up and beats, and comedy to contrast the themes you introduce at appropriate moments.
[06:03:21] <imode> all these flavors need to balance out.

[06:04:13] <indigo> Wow that new Bond had a terrible ending
[06:04:15] <imode> "As long as I know the shape of my soul, I'll be alright."
[06:04:38] <manicennui> Yeah, how the hell is this a kid's cartoon?
[06:04:49] <imode> people wonder if or why I'm an old grumpy grouch.
[06:04:54] <bkero> its not
[06:05:08] <imode> because nobody's steering the ship anymore.
[06:05:19] <imode> nobody's giving kids life advice through a glowing screen anymore.
[06:05:26] <manicennui> That scene is deeper than most adult shows.
[06:05:48] <imode> I have a hypothesis that the decline in behavior and mental health of kids started when shows like these stopped being popular/aired regularly.
[06:06:08] <manicennui> Did Adventure Time end?
[06:06:14] <imode> yes, twice.
[06:06:27] <manicennui> Is Steven's Universe similar?
[06:06:32] <imode> don't watch SU.
[06:06:53] <manicennui> I've seen some things that indicate to me that it has similar moments.
[06:06:54] <imode> that was mine and my wife's show we bonded over so heavily when we were in college. it is a tremendous letdown.
[06:07:23] <manicennui> The Amazing World of Gumball has some really cynical moments that I love.
[06:07:31] <imode> it has good moments. in fact it has tremendous moments. but it was thrown away because the show's creator is not a good person and not a good writer.
[06:07:39] <manicennui> I have never really watched any of these shows. I just see clips.
[06:07:53] <imode> SU is good up until, roughly, the end of season 1.
[06:08:20] <imode> after that point it's just post-facto disappointment because you expect a lot of the developments that happen to lead up into a grand and spanning plotline.
[06:08:39] <imode> like, they set up things for all of these complicated topics, and then take the easy way out of kidsplaining/paving them over.

[06:08:51] <buttsbot> The Amazing World of Gumball | All The Cringe At Work | Cartoon Network - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvysuMQW4sc#t=2m40s
[06:09:26] <Brekkjern> Meh. I should go to bed. It's 3:40 over here :P
[06:09:34] <imode> "good to know, we'll come for them next"
[06:09:39] <Brekkjern> Night!
[06:09:43] <imode> later Brekkjern!
[06:10:35] <imode> I think 2017 is where it started to go pretty far downhill.
[06:11:14] <imode> there are a couple of factors. lots of shows were wrapping up with little to no replacements in the run schedule, you didn't have things like "What A Cartoon!" that could serve as an experimentation ground for new works.
[06:12:07] <imode> and there was a significant jump in a lot of platforms' user base. kids do not have an incentive to watch TV anymore.
[06:13:28] <imode> and that's a pretty large problem. there's no "Mr. Rogers" for the internet. we were allowed to get to the point we were for kids' TV because it was a relatively centralized medium. now, content has become more addictive and sharable because it's smaller, lighter and faster to deliver the comedic punch.
[06:14:04] <imode> and nobody's really checking who does what, nobody's a reliable source for that content, and the creativity of it is second to how fast you can get it to spread over a network.
[06:15:01] <imode> if I were a kid growing up in a world like this I'd have a very different set of personal values and sentiments.
[06:15:07] <manicennui> I think it boils down to corporate interests dominating art.
[06:15:08] <imode> despite all else being roughly the same.
[06:15:24] <imode> well, yeah. but the difference is a television program is a different medium than a tiktok.
[06:15:44] <imode> it's noninteractive, it's non-shareable, so the incentive to watch it is that.. it's entertaining.
[06:16:01] <manicennui> It's always been a battle between corporate interests and art, but we've gotten to the point where the art barely matters at all.
[06:16:17] <manicennui> It's extreme optimization for views.
[06:16:33] <imode> again, you won't find Mr. Rogers standing up to say "we need PBS for the internet".
[06:17:00] <manicennui> Video games have probably taken a big chunk of television time too.
[06:17:11] <imode> they're the next thing.
[06:17:17] <Church> indigo: I thought the ending was alright
[06:17:30] <Church> Don't like the chick who's supposed to be our new 007 however
[06:18:07] <imode> like, genuinely. they are. we've had computing devices proliferated, and now we have a pretty lawless landscape about what constitutes interactive entertainment, but it'll either implode or settle out into something like that great heyday.
[06:18:32] <imode> or the peak has already happened and we're doomed to slide into a corporate apocalypse where creativity is absent.
[06:19:48] <manicennui> Gotta create the next addictive immersive world to make a bunch of money so I can fuck off!
[06:20:24] <manicennui> Meta is kind of scary.
[06:20:28] <manicennui> It could be the end.
[06:21:24] <dminkovsky> it's incredible FB is so big the can just "make it so"
[06:21:26] <imode> the end of what.
[06:21:29] <manicennui> They sold more Oculus headsets than MS sold Xboxes.
[06:21:36] <manicennui> This year.
[06:21:37] <imode> because there's been a chip shortage.
[06:21:42] <dminkovsky> no matter how reviled, no matter how negative the media converage; overnight they made metaverse a thing
[06:21:55] <imode> I mean, they kind of didn't.
[06:21:56] <manicennui> imode: The end of hope for humanity.
[06:21:58] <dminkovsky> the end of civilization?
[06:22:10] <manicennui> There will be some form of civilization.
[06:22:17] <imode> metaverse isn't a "thing" no matter how much zuck the fuck pays mediamen.
[06:22:26] <dminkovsky> but it is imode
[06:22:31] <dminkovsky> it's a household name
[06:22:31] <manicennui> But it will mostly be people strung out and spending all of their free time in some VR world.
[06:23:21] <imode> manicennui: unless they have you on a heroin drip that isn't happening.
[06:23:31] <imode> the headsets are uncomfortable for long periods and the technology is lackluster.
[06:23:43] <imode> this is an attempt at entering an already niche market.
[06:23:46] <manicennui> imode: When has that ever mattered?
[06:24:12] <manicennui> I think it could be one of those things that geeks dismiss but the average person loves.
[06:24:12] <imode> since man made office chairs, dude.
[06:24:24] <manicennui> Like why the fuck do so many people still use Facebook?
[06:24:31] <imode> it's not "geeks dismiss". comfort isn't something that's only recognizable to people who know perl.
[06:24:48] <dminkovsky> imode: facebook makes people literally miserable
[06:24:52] <imode> they are uncomfortable and the experiences you have with the hardware are not objectively worth the price.
[06:25:01] <imode> dminkovsky: no argument here.
[06:25:11] <indigo> Church: It just didn't seem like a Bond movie to me
[06:25:13] <dminkovsky> so if they use something that makes them want to die
[06:25:22] <Church> indigo: Fair enough.
[06:25:25] <dminkovsky> they'll use something that makes them physically a bit uncomfortable
[06:25:36] <indigo> Also I wish they wrote a better character for Rami Malek
[06:25:41] <imode> "a bit uncomfortable" is an understatement if you're intending on people using these headsets for more than an hour.
[06:25:53] <manicennui> imode: It's not as though they can't change the design over time, and a fuckton of people have already bought the thing.
[06:26:22] <imode> phones were one thing. tablets are another thing. you cannot shove a pair of goggles over our eyes for long periods without us being uncomfortable.
[06:26:29] <dminkovsky> could be but ppl will go to great lengths to feel relevant and connected
[06:26:31] <imode> otherwise, all CPAP manufacturers will want to suck your dick.
[06:26:46] <imode> it is not a "psychological" thing, it is literally a physiological thing.
[06:27:01] <dminkovsky> we'll see...
[06:27:20] <dminkovsky> from where i sit, "metaverse" entered the lexicon as a matter of fact, a basic truth, overnight
[06:27:37] <imode> and you take your lexicon additions from people paid by zuckerberg?
[06:27:38] <dminkovsky> all they have to do is kinda, sorta deliver and iterate
[06:27:44] <imode> perhaps the problem isn't facebook for you.
[06:27:46] <dminkovsky> not exclusively
[06:27:55] <imode> here's the thing.
[06:28:10] <imode> everyone from zoomers to boomers right now isn't buying the vision, or even knows about the vision, or cares about the vision.
[06:28:24] <imode> you'll hear loud voices from people with paid megaphones. the drive simply does not exist.
[06:28:52] <dminkovsky> just yesterday i stood outside a friend's living room who had just bought an oculus and was raving about it
[06:29:02] <dminkovsky> this same person buys NFTs
[06:29:17] <imode> call me in six months when it's collecting dust.
[06:29:22] <dminkovsky> i hope man
[06:29:30] * dminkovsky raises a toast to that
[06:29:54] <imode> I've been around for way too many stupid fucking pushes to do XYZ or make XYZ a "thing".
[06:30:00] <imode> it never works.
[06:31:07] <dminkovsky> i can bring basically an endless list of things that were made "a thing" with marketing
[06:31:12] <dminkovsky> like, my favorite of all time
[06:31:16] <dminkovsky> devil's food cakes
[06:31:18] <manicennui> Like the Xbox.
[06:31:22] <manicennui> Which was a joke for a long time.
[06:31:23] <dminkovsky> like wtf out of nowhere in 1995
[06:31:27] <manicennui> MS just spent money until it wasn't.
[06:31:31] <dminkovsky> yeah
[06:31:34] <imode> how was it a joke.
[06:32:44] <imode> see, that's the thing. those are products, not concepts. those are pieces of tangible hardware that run software. the occulus is a piece of hardware that runs software.
[06:33:21] <imode> the metaverse is literally a concept pitch of a VR experience on par with IMVU with microtransactions.
[06:33:31] *** Joins: art_vandelay (~art_vande@142.126.234.156)
[06:33:57] <imode> in this era, this year, we're used to thinking of words and concepts as encompassing our entire mind's vision. because that's exactly what these companies want you to do: they want to put a word out there, make it spread and then make it mean everything and anything.
[06:34:19] <imode> they want to make your dreams and extrapolations from terms and concepts into something that they can tie back to them, something that they've authored.
[06:34:22] <manicennui> imode: It sold about half as well as they predicted, was basically trounced by the PS2, they had to keep lowering the price to increase sales, etc.
[06:34:24] <imode> idiots who buy NFTs are succeptible.
[06:34:28] <manicennui> And they lost a fuckton of money on it.
[06:34:43] <imode> manicennui: so? that's product development. if you have enough money and feedback to not suck, make it not suck.
[06:34:48] <imode> that is not a bad thing.
[06:34:52] <imode> it's actually a good thing!
[06:35:12] <manicennui> imode: They dumped more money into making it a success than most companies will ever have.
[06:35:33] <dminkovsky> manicennui: why do you think they bailed on the zune?
[06:35:36] <imode> companies can have bad products and then put out good products.
[06:35:46] <manicennui> "Microsoft was unable to make a steady profit off the console, which had a manufacturing price far more expensive than its retail price, despite its popularity, losing over $4 billion during its market life."
[06:36:00] <manicennui> imode: I don't think you understand the magnitude of the failure.
[06:36:02] <imode> what companies can't do is take credit for all the things you think the "metaverse" will be before any of the code's been written.
[06:36:19] <imode> manicennui: I work at Amazon. we deal with that magnitude regularly.
[06:36:33] <dminkovsky> they're doing it though
[06:36:47] <imode> and when it comes out, the world will laugh and laugh and laugh.
[06:36:56] <dminkovsky> it's out
[06:36:56] <imode> at their shitty experience running on hardware that runs software.
[06:37:02] <dminkovsky> my friend was walking around in it yesterday
[06:37:09] <imode> and what were the impressions.
[06:37:19] <dminkovsky> "very cool" etc
[06:37:27] <imode> call me in six months.
[06:37:29] <dminkovsky> not maybe as cool as some of the games
[06:37:36] <dminkovsky> in six months he'll have the next oculus :)
[06:37:45] <manicennui> If Facebook is smart, they will find some way to make it addictive.
[06:37:49] <imode> yeah, sure.
[06:37:50] <manicennui> Microtransactions out the ass.
[06:37:53] <dminkovsky> lol they will
[06:38:11] <imode> you'll have whales for everything.
[06:38:20] <dminkovsky> they'll give it out for free to women
[06:38:38] <imode> https://www.oculus.com/facebook-horizon/
[06:38:51] <dminkovsky> ladie's night in the metaverse
[06:38:52] <imode> this is fucking hilarious.
[06:39:15] <imode> go and watch the trailer.
[06:39:19] <imode> no, seriously. watch the trailer.
[06:39:39] <manicennui> No one here is claiming that they think metaverse is great.
[06:39:41] <dminkovsky> i can't
[06:39:46] <dminkovsky> yeah lol
[06:39:49] <dminkovsky> it makes me sick
[06:39:51] <manicennui> Only that you seem to be overestimating the average person.
[06:39:57] <dminkovsky> yes
[06:40:02] <imode> no, I'm saying it's going to be a very large flop.
[06:40:12] <imode> despite my low expectations for the average person.
[06:40:13] <manicennui> Possibly.
[06:40:16] <manicennui> I'm not so sure.
[06:40:30] <manicennui> People rarely seem to do things that make sense.
[06:40:35] <dminkovsky> i'll tell you imode, the fact that it's gotten this far
[06:40:37] <dminkovsky> despite everything
[06:40:41] <imode> despite.. what.
[06:40:43] <dminkovsky> is shocking
[06:40:55] <imode> all things come back to the physical. stop thinking so damn abstractly.
[06:41:07] <dminkovsky> welp despite the super obvious rebrand-under-duress
[06:41:08] <imode> you have hardware, that runs software. this game is a new piece of software.
[06:41:21] <dminkovsky> the same week when a whitselblower was talking on capitol hill how this shit harms people
[06:41:24] <imode> erase every other piece of whatever media you consumed that told you this was the next "matrix".
[06:41:32] <imode> this is hardware, that runs software.
[06:41:37] <dminkovsky> they rename their company, out in the open, wag the dog so to speak, no one gives even half a fuck
[06:41:43] <dminkovsky> buys headgrear and plays along w/ them
[06:41:52] <dminkovsky> it's like how google sells phones when really they should be giving them away
[06:41:57] <dminkovsky> it's fucking flagrant
[06:42:06] <dminkovsky> and no one even blinks
[06:42:09] <dminkovsky> it's amazing!
[06:42:24] <imode> "and no one even blinks" you do realize that in order to change anything we have to kill people, right.
[06:42:34] <imode> like, bomb facebook offices, hold congresspeople hostage.
[06:42:37] <imode> right.
[06:42:38] <dminkovsky> right
[06:42:41] <dminkovsky> exactly
[06:42:44] <imode> that's why no one blinks.
[06:42:49] <imode> our fear of death was weaned off of us.
[06:42:51] <dminkovsky> so that's my point, and possibly manicennui's
[06:42:58] <dminkovsky> i can't speak for him
[06:43:12] <dminkovsky> but uh, i was shocked
[06:43:13] <imode> so, what. what's the negative here. because we can't get lower than "this is the status quo".
[06:43:16] <dminkovsky> i thought people would be cynical about it
[06:43:22] <imode> we're already at the bottom, dude.
[06:43:24] <dminkovsky> "wow, what do they think we're stupid or something?"
[06:43:27] <dminkovsky> nooooop
[06:43:44] <dminkovsky> they go out and buy the headsets and start using the word "metaverse" like it's been around since adam and eve
[06:43:59] <dminkovsky> stunning, really
[06:44:23] <imode> if it bothers you, start making pipe bombs.
[06:44:28] <dminkovsky> lol no
[06:44:42] <dminkovsky> no thank you
[06:44:52] <dminkovsky> i don't even agree that bombing anything would help
[06:45:02] <dminkovsky> you can't bomb your way out of this
[06:45:19] <imode> violence is always the answer to the question of "how do I stop bad people that have taken over my way of life".
[06:45:20] <dminkovsky> why end up in RDX whatever
[06:45:26] <dminkovsky> when it won't even help
[06:45:32] <dminkovsky> just ask ted kaczynski
[06:45:37] <imode> MLK did not get where he did without Malcom X and black power movements.
[06:45:42] <dminkovsky> he was a bit too intense but he certainly was on to something
[06:45:48] <imode> all action is driven by war.
[06:45:50] <dminkovsky> his methods, however, were pointless
[06:45:58] <dminkovsky> yeah but being ted kaczynski is not productive
[06:46:07] <dminkovsky> the same ppl who buy oculus this week just think you're a freak
[06:46:13] <dminkovsky> which you kind of are
[06:46:20] <manicennui> Maybe Ted's goal was to get lots of overtime pay for FBI agents.
[06:46:21] <dminkovsky> if you kill random ppl
[06:46:26] <imode> being a singular ted kaczynski is not productive. being 500 of them is.
[06:46:46] <dminkovsky> 500 is a very, very small number
[06:46:51] <manicennui> You are going to get us all visited by the FBI.
[06:46:59] <imode> you assume they ain't here already. :P
[06:47:06] <dminkovsky> it's art_vandelay duh
[06:47:07] * manicennui eyes buttsbot 
[06:47:11] <imode> dminkovsky: ideologies can multiply.
[06:47:28] <imode> 500 begets 1000, 1000 begets 10000. to deny that is to deny that facebook has that same power.
[06:47:31] <dminkovsky> yeah violence doesn't attract stable, useful ppl
[06:47:39] <imode> I mean. do you need stable, useful people.
[06:47:43] <dminkovsky> always
[06:47:46] <imode> the point is that we're unstable. the point is everything is unstable.
[06:47:54] <imode> stable, useful people don't seek to upend their stable, useful way of life.
[06:47:54] <art_vandelay> FBI open up!
[06:47:56] <dminkovsky> not really
[06:48:12] <dminkovsky> things could be a lot, a lot more unstable
[06:48:12] <imode> call me when the revolution comes.
[06:48:25] <imode> yeah, sure. watch that snake creeping up your neck.
[06:48:25] <dminkovsky> the revolution will not be televised
[06:48:30] <dminkovsky> and will not be in the oculus
[06:48:32] <imode> afk.
[06:49:06] <manicennui> art_vandelay: You said you were an importer exporter!
[06:49:42] <dminkovsky> MLK also basically got nowhere
[06:50:06] <dminkovsky> sucks to be black in the USA
[06:50:35] <dminkovsky> every 10 years there's a protest movement and nothing happens
[06:50:59] <dminkovsky> george floyd was hardly the first george floyd, more like, the 1,000ths
[06:51:11] <dminkovsky> and won't be the last
[06:51:13] <manicennui> I think we just need enough boomers to die off at this point.
[06:51:22] <dminkovsky> yeah
[06:51:31] <dminkovsky> i don't even hate boomers but i think you're right about that
[06:51:36] <dminkovsky> but even that won't solve it
[06:51:52] <manicennui> There aren't a lot of boomers whom I like.
[06:52:10] <dminkovsky> boomer hate does not strongly resonate w/ me
[06:52:31] <dminkovsky> they took the segregation off the books
[06:52:35] <dminkovsky> but look at society
[06:52:42] <dminkovsky> it's just unofficial that's all
[06:52:46] <manicennui> Obviously not every boomer is the same, but there do seem to be a lot of common problems with them.
[06:53:29] <dminkovsky> boomers rule zoomers drool
[06:53:42] <manicennui> Obviously Gen X is the best.
[06:53:45] <dminkovsky> lol
[06:53:51] <imode> this is so stupid. I mean, jesus, this isn't even feature-parity with VRChat. this is more like someone discovering an indie game and making a corporate version of it to pair with hardware they're selling.
[06:53:53] <imode> let 'em.
[06:53:56] <dminkovsky> janeane garofalo
[06:54:04] <dminkovsky> is peak humanity
[06:54:23] <dminkovsky> and by extension, Reality Bites is the best movie ever made
[06:54:51] <dminkovsky> if i'm alive in 6 months, i look forward to revisting this
[06:55:04] <manicennui> Is there reason to believe you won't be?
[06:55:31] <dminkovsky> Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high / Cause you never know when you're gonna go
[06:55:42] <dminkovsky> the unpredictable elokim manicennui
[06:56:19] <manicennui> dminkovsky: Sure, but usually people assume they will be alive in 6 months and don't feel the need to mention it.
[06:56:33] <imode> fwiw I didn't think I'd be here last year.
[06:56:57] <manicennui> The "if I'm alive" is assumed, but not usually considered much of a concern.
[06:57:09] <imode> suicide attempts are a common first assumption.

[06:59:39] <Xe> shit's not fun otherwise
[06:59:59] <dminkovsky> what i told a doctor at the hospital

[07:00:11] <dminkovsky> and he was like "so you're a numbers guy"
[07:00:14] <dminkovsky> and started telling me about stats
[07:00:19] <dminkovsky> i was like "bro, don't tell me about stats"
[07:00:27] <dminkovsky> that was so annoying
[07:00:30] <imode> "I am not a statistician, you're wrong."

[07:03:06] <Xe> that is what you describe your job as
[07:03:43] <dminkovsky> my job is to apply Stirling's approximation to as many situations as possible
[07:03:55] <dminkovsky> aka to deliver something
[07:03:58] <dminkovsky> that kinda works :)
[07:04:00] <imode> if we don't give the right information to someone they can cause Amazon multiple billions of dollars in damage.
[07:04:27] <imode> so. yeah. that's what I describe my job as.
[07:04:49] <dminkovsky> holy shit stirling's approximation is from the 1600s

[07:11:18] <imode> full body tracking gear?!
[07:11:38] <dminkovsky> i drank some vodka yesterday
[07:12:05] <dminkovsky> yeah how does that work? is that like kinect?
[07:12:05] <imode> what the hell does full body tracking gear look like.
[07:12:12] <imode> morph suit?
[07:12:20] <Xe> imode: yeah, i have 3 tracking pucks that i strap to my ankles and waist
[07:12:34] <imode> oh that's nuts. can you wear regular clothes.
[07:12:51] <Xe> it doesn't get a perfect result, however it does give enough info to the game engine to allow you to pole dance so
[07:12:58] <imode> ...
[07:13:08] <imode> lit.
[07:13:11] <dminkovsky> zomg
[07:13:16] <Xe> i don't do pole dancing in VR but I know someone who is crazy enough to try to
[07:13:45] <imode> that's actually pretty neat, I'm surprised that tracking pucks work.
[07:14:03] <imode> are they.. ergonomic?

[07:41:39] <imode> what I would do.
[07:41:46] <imode> then when effort is back in full gear, do it.

[07:42:06] <dminkovsky> but roll with it, yes
[07:42:20] <imode> think of it as ruminating on an idea that you need to think out fully.

[20:03:13] <indigo> When you winter over, isn't the facility just on lockdown?
[20:03:18] <gwozniak> I don't know how long I would want to be there, but I would certainly try it for a month.  Surely it would have to be longer than that, though
[20:03:23] <manicennui> Guess I don't need the most extreme suit.
[20:03:50] <manicennui> There is a -35C suit.

[20:05:48] <manicennui> Parts of Alaska are very cold and isolated, but you could manage to make it to civilization if you had to.
[20:07:09] <indigo> I like our cushy indoor jobs
[20:07:27] <ngoldbaum> helps these days that there are satellite emergency beacons and satphones if you’re really in trouble
[20:07:57] <manicennui> indigo: You could do our cushy jobs from a cabin in Alaska.
[20:08:30] <manicennui> Satellite is not great for video calls though.
[20:08:34] <manicennui> Oh well, guess I can't join.
[20:08:57] <manicennui> Please use email to communicate with me.
[20:11:11] <indigo> Half a second latency isn't too bad
[20:12:22] <gwozniak> If I could do my work from a remote cabin I would
[20:13:05] <gwozniak> Although I doubt I would want to spend all my time there.  I like getting out every now and then
[20:14:14] <indigo> Would you ever become a digital nomad?
[20:14:37] <indigo> Eg. other countries
[20:15:28] <manicennui> gwozniak: Cabin on some land, but on the outskirts of a town/city.
[20:16:23] <indigo> I just want a house with no shared walls
[20:16:25] <indigo> Would be great
[20:17:51] <gwozniak> indigo: I might travel to other countries, but I'm not really drawn to it.  I tend to like the Canadian wilderness and I'm not a huge fan of air travel

[20:23:17] <manicennui> I also live in Chicago currently, so I'm exposed to quite a bit.
[20:23:48] <manicennui> ngoldbaum: They are actually independent.
[20:24:10] <manicennui> They were owned by another company for a bit, and that company sold the rights to Sesame Street.
[20:24:29] <manicennui> "Subsequently, control of the company was assumed by Henson's children: Lisa, Cheryl, Brian, John, and Heather. In 2000, Henson was sold to German media company EM.TV & Merchandising AG; by the end of that year, however, EM.TV's stock collapsed, and the Henson family re-acquired the company in 2003."
[20:24:51] <ngoldbaum> oh ok i guess they just have a deal with them

[21:04:25] <gwozniak> A total scourge, imo
[21:05:54] <manicennui> Our courtyard is mostly concrete. There are just small patches of grass and flowerbeds.

[23:23:37] <manicennui> "Police were called to the scene following numerous reports of an assault with a deadly weapon and a possible shooting in progress at the store."
[23:23:41] <manicennui> People were fucked at that point.
[23:24:21] <manicennui> "Valentina's grandmother, Veronica Larenas, told Chilevision that the teen had been adapting well to life in the United States."
[23:24:25] <manicennui> Welcome to America!
[23:25:44] <imode> what the hell was the situation when they arrived.
[23:26:09] <imode> so, someone called the police saying.. what, someone's got a gun, is hunting around the store, and an assault happened?
[23:26:29] <imode> "Moments later, he returns to the escalators wearing a multicolored jacket and long pants before swinging his bike lock at customers, according to police. He is seen attacking several female customers."
[23:27:01] <imode> okay. dude's going around hitting people with a bike lock. someone mis-reported it as someone with a gun and shooting people.
[23:27:04] <manicennui> You can see the video.
[23:27:14] <imode> yeah, it wasn't very clear.
[23:27:18] <manicennui> Looks like they found his victim who was bleeding, and just shot him as soon as they saw him.
[23:27:37] <imode> what a great escalation. and that bullet soared through a wall and killed a girl.
[23:27:39] <manicennui> They probably think they are special forces.
[23:27:46] <imode> "let me take point with the rifle".
[23:27:57] <imode> you could've gone in with tazers, mace and a handgun with a reserve force outside.
[23:28:16] <imode> what a mess.
[23:29:00] <manicennui> Just another day in this shithole country.
[23:29:24] <imode> sadly I understand, though. someone calls in and says "shooting" and you're given two options: respond with the force required to deal with a shooter, or respond with two parts of a force, one heavily armed, one lightly armed to asses the situation.
[23:29:37] <imode> the former was taken because it was easier to organize.
[23:29:44] <imode> and nobody thinks about dressing rooms.
[23:30:19] <imode> if our police are going to arm themselves like the military, they need to be trained like the military.
[23:31:10] <manicennui> Stores should just add kevlar to all of their structures.
[23:31:24] <manicennui> Let's just turn the US into a shooting gallery.
[23:31:49] <manicennui> Give those poor guns their freedom.
[23:31:58] <imode> if you were in that situation, and you had a sketchy report of multiple people down, and the report that a handgun is involved, what would you do.
[23:32:12] <imode> that isn't a snarky response, that's a legitimate question.
[23:32:24] <manicennui> I don't know, because I'm not paid to think about and train for these types of things.
[23:32:34] <manicennui> And I don't pretend to know what the best approach is.
[23:32:39] <manicennui> I also know that US cops don't either.
[23:33:15] <imode> my grandfather was a sheriff for a majority of his life, and I had an opportunity to ask him about quite a few things before he passed in 2010. much of the skill behind being a constable was situational awareness and management.
[23:33:25] <manicennui> Their modus operandi is to keep themselves alive at all costs, and to sort everything out afterward.
[23:33:52] <manicennui> That combined with the fact that they are taught to fear everything is a deadly mix.
[23:34:39] <imode> if you don't have grasp of a situation, but you need to act or people die, what choice do you have.
[23:35:18] <manicennui> Cops in other developed countries don't end up shooting people very often.
[23:35:51] <imode> that's because they don't anticipate a force on par with firearms in other countries.
[23:36:01] <imode> most of it is, apparently, knife or blunt object attacks.
[23:36:16] <imode> so you have a choice. wall off firearms or respond like this. I know what I'd choose.
[23:36:19] <manicennui> We also shoot people with knives here.
[23:36:34] <imode> right, but the normalization of "they could have a gun" means you respond with a gun.
[23:36:49] <imode> if that possibility is rare or eliminated, you don't respond with a gun.
[23:37:05] <imode> get rid of firearms, the police will de-escalate.
[23:37:23] <manicennui> The officer didn't even try anything in that video.
[23:37:26] <imode> keep them around, and you'll keep having this unfortunate situation. it is inevitable when you have firearms.
[23:37:28] <manicennui> He shot as soon as he saw the guy.
[23:37:36] <imode> from what I saw the dude was charging him.
[23:37:44] <imode> need to watch it again.
[23:37:59] <imode> nope, he was going away.
[23:37:59] <manicennui> Nah
[23:38:09] <manicennui> They never announced themselves as police
[23:38:15] <manicennui> Never instructed him to do anything
[23:38:18] <manicennui> Just saw him and fired
[23:38:21] <imode> what a mess.
[23:38:35] <imode> you can hear the panic in their voices as well.
[23:38:43] <imode> "she's bleeding, she's bleeding!" it sounds like a scared boy.
[23:39:16] <imode> again. train them like the military if you're going to arm them like the military. this should be at the federal level.
[23:39:27] <imode> states should not manage their own police forces.
[23:39:40] <manicennui> There is almost nothing that should be managed at the state level.
[23:39:44] <manicennui> States are a terrible idea.
[23:39:51] <manicennui> Just 50 different ways to fuck with people.
[23:39:53] <imode> bUt MuH fReEdOmS
[23:40:09] <imode> sTaTe RiGhTs
[23:40:13] <manicennui> Almost nothing that varies between states is legitimate.
[23:40:25] <imode> commie.
[23:40:42] <imode> gosh darn communists taking away our freedoms.
[23:40:51] <manicennui> Local decisions should be within a strong national framework.
[23:41:16] <manicennui> So yeah, some local people can be involved in zoning decisions, but zoning shouldn't vary wildly from state to state.
[23:41:20] <imode> one life is worth arming good ol' boys with rifles to go kill minorities.
[23:41:36] <manicennui> Voting laws should be absolutely the same nationally.
[23:41:37] <imode> I guarantee you a majority of folks saw the name and were like "good, another dead immigrant".
[23:41:56] <manicennui> Maybe not a majority, but certainly a good chunk.
[23:42:08] <imode> what a world.
[23:42:11] <manicennui> I'm sure most cops think it is fine.
[23:42:14] <imode> or, rather, what a country.
[23:42:25] <imode> cops are just undertrained soldiers.
[23:42:29] <manicennui> The only concern most cops have is probably whether the cop who did the shooting will get in trouble.
[23:42:48] <manicennui> They're more like gangs.
[23:42:56] <imode> squads.
[23:42:56] <manicennui> Complete with organized crime.
[23:51:39] <manicennui> How were most apartment buildings heated 100 years ago?
[23:51:59] <manicennui> I feel like central air is one of the worst ways to heat and cool homes.
[23:52:06] <manicennui> Never fully comfortable.
[23:53:29] <manicennui> I assume some form of radiators were common.
