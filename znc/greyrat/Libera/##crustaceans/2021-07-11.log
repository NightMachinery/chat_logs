[08:34:04] <quanticle> riv: I showed that (earthly.dev) to a friend, highlighting that line, and his reply was, "This is why incest is illegal"
[08:41:16] <companion_cube> :D
[08:48:05] <quanticle> And yeah, I looked through the documentation for earthly.dev, and I'm not sure how this is different from the sorts of containerized builds you can get with, e.g. Gitlab.
[08:55:15] <drakonis> earthly is a tirefire
[08:59:32] <companion_cube> on the face of it I kind of like the idea
[08:59:38] <companion_cube> it's what docker should be, in a way
[09:01:48] <quanticle> I mostly object to the fact that they characterize it as something that's brand new, when containerized build systems are anything but.
[09:03:08] <companion_cube> curious, what else does that? does bazel containerize?
[09:04:44] <drakonis> i object to it on the grounds that this has been done a dozen times
[09:04:46] <jjuran> Sounds like they named the business before checking to see if earth.ly was already taken
[09:05:10] <drakonis> bazel can do containers
[09:05:39] <jjuran> but does it do windows
[09:06:03] <drakonis> yes
[09:06:16] <drakonis> also lol @ windows
[09:06:53] <drakonis> those strong community numbers lol
[09:08:39] <drakonis> so you kno wwhat's dumb about this?
[09:08:42] <drakonis> its reliant on docker
[09:09:05] <drakonis> tight coupling wih docker, FUCK.
[09:09:13] <drakonis> what is even the point of this
[09:10:22] <drakonis> also its reinventing build systems badly
[09:19:11] <companion_cube> so it must be as slow as docker…

[10:46:39] <dmc> https://github.com/tjdevries/vim9jit
[10:46:39] <buttsbot> GitHub - tjdevries/vim9jit: Ok, hear me out. vim9script... but in lua... so fast
[10:57:43] <drakonis> isnt that neovim
[10:58:18] <quanticle> I don't think so. I thought neovim allowed you to use Lua in addition to vimscript.
[10:58:39] <drakonis> it does both but lua is the more popular option
[10:58:42] <quanticle> Whereas what this person is doing is compiling vimscript to Lua, and then using LuaJIT to optimize the hell out of it.
[10:58:55] <drakonis> that is terrible
[10:59:21] <quanticle> No argument... but, at the same time, I can look at that and say, "I respect that"
[10:59:37] <quanticle> "I disagree, but I can respect it"
[10:59:50] <drakonis> looks like neovim implements vimscript in lua?
[10:59:53] <drakonis> not sure
[11:01:17] <quanticle> I feel like this is appropriate for #lobsters, so I'm going to re-post it there
[11:01:23] <drakonis> oh its just an aggressive refactor of vim
[11:01:26] <drakonis> and that made it better
