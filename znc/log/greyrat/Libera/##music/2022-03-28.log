[01:39:40] <artao> that depends on the mouthpiece to a large degree

[01:40:00] <artao> cup diameter in particular
[01:40:40] <artao> narrower vs wider buzzing space. wider is easier for low freq of course
[01:41:03] <artao> i was researching mouthpiece design a few weeks back. i didn't realize how much there is to it
[01:42:18] <artao> cup diameter, depth, shape, inner edge shape, lip surface shape, outer lip shape, throat shape, diameter, and length, and the shape and diameter of the backbore
[01:42:50] <macrobat> whatif it wasn't circular and you could turn it to get a range of diameters

[02:10:56] <artao> sure, 1st gets the more complex parts, but in a pro orchestra a 3rd seat player surely could play the 1st seat parts
[02:11:15] <artao> but all together they create chords like you'd play on a piano or guitar. simple triads

[18:23:55] <FreeRangeDillo> good morning
[18:25:49] <morlog> trying to work my wool blanket in on this trip
[18:26:42] <morlog> dont really have much in the suitcase, its kind of heavy stuff though
[18:27:33] <FreeRangeDillo> so you decided to take the pack frame?
[18:27:47] <morlog> a 100 watt solar panel might be a bit of overkill for keeping my phone charged but leaves me open to other options
[18:27:52] <morlog> yeah
[18:28:06] <morlog> kind of have to
[18:28:22] <FreeRangeDillo> might as well have the panel if you'd have a use for it
[18:28:28] <morlog> might still be able to slim down enough
[18:28:33] <morlog> would just be close
[18:28:43] <morlog> its the weight limitation
[18:29:17] <morlog> also space inside the bags i have for carry on
[18:32:36] <morlog> wouldnt have room for clothes

[18:33:30] <morlog> yeah
[18:33:37] <morlog> done it before
[18:33:47] <morlog> used to fly a lot before 9/11
[18:34:00] <morlog> this will be the second time I've flown after
[18:34:07] <FreeRangeDillo> well then at least you know what the requirements are

[18:35:00] <morlog> easy to see with the xray cat scan stuff
[18:35:42] <morlog> seems like each item of gear I have weighs about 5 pounds

[18:38:22] <FreeRangeDillo> so just the phone for internet then?
[18:38:36] <morlog> dont really want to lug it around hawaii either unless its making me money
[18:38:44] <morlog> yeah
[18:38:53] <morlog> thats what I usually do when I travel
[18:39:21] <morlog> I'll get a new laptop when I get back stateside
[18:40:04] <morlog> need something a lot smaller and lighter for travel
[18:40:12] <morlog> also with a good battery life
[18:41:00] <FreeRangeDillo> a netbook?
[18:41:15] <morlog> ultrabook hopefully
[18:41:32] <morlog> one of thos alienware laptops with an 11" screen
[18:41:36] <FreeRangeDillo> never heard of that term
[18:41:38] <FreeRangeDillo> ok
[18:41:39] <morlog> i wish
[18:42:05] <morlog> ultrabooks are like netbooks but with a lot better specs
[18:42:23] <morlog> more ram, better cpu's
[18:43:09] <morlog> I'll probably end up with another frankentop
