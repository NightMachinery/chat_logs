[01:46:07] <sunjonSenghanBri> make changes to the `CursorLine` highlight group; Ensure cursorline is turned on, if that's what the user expects; Ensure that the correct hl group is set when done or aborted

[01:47:30] <sunjonSenghanBri> if you want to be fancy, use a temporary hl_group, then you can lerp between two values(with a color range or blend), and return to the original setting
[01:48:39] <sunjonSenghanBri> re: timers, remember to `timer:close()` them
[01:49:27] <sunjonSenghanBri> and re:vim.loop.timer, you'll want to `schedule_wrap(...)` the entire function you call from your timer
[01:49:37] <megalithic_twitt> ahh good call , hah, my naive assumption of just disabling/enabling was going to be enough, but you're right; gotta deal with the highlights
[01:50:48] <sunjonSenghanBri> well, it's the least 'destructive' 
[01:51:01] <sunjonSenghanBri> if your plugin wanted to toggle them, then you'd .. turn it on and off.
[01:51:49] <sunjonSenghanBri> you implied it was just a visual notification. It might not apply in this case, but turning settings on and off can trigger other events

[15:10:42] * Soup[m] makes plugin but attaches them to the bottom of each buffer ðŸ”ª
[15:11:04] <b0o> you ruined it :(
[15:13:02] <Soup[m]> Wouldn't be a lot of code I think? You should be able to hook an autocommand for new buffer and show/hide buffer to handle swapping
[15:13:30] <Soup[m]> not sure how expensive making a new float each time you need vs updating a few static windows in the correct spots
[15:13:43] <Soup[m]> creating new windows each time is probably easier, less state to track
[15:14:15] <Soup[m]> Probably you'd get some "flashing" though
[15:16:09] <b0o> nvim-treesitter-context does something sorta similar, it seems to work pretty well. It does stutter a bit if a window is resized while the context floatwin is open but not too bad.

[15:33:51] <clason[m]> I think it's always best to work on issues that affect you personally.
[15:34:22] <clason[m]> You can also look at PRs that have stalled and ask if you can take them over -- that is usually a good method of getting familiar with the code.
[15:35:00] <clason[m]> Depending on your background, anything that involves (only) Lua is by default a good first issue, since the code is fairly clean and compartmentalized.
[15:35:23] <clason[m]> Currently the area in biggest need of additional hands is tree-sitter support, I'd say.

[21:34:02] <lordmzte> that just opens nvim normally and outputs a bunch of errors when i open the command line :/
[21:34:53] <lordmzte> oh wait its meant to work like less being interactive

[21:34:57] <lordmzte> well thats not really what i meant tho
[21:35:01] <gpanders> <lordmzte[m]> "is there a plugin thatll allow..." <- you can open it in readonly mode with `nvim -r`
[21:36:19] <lordmzte> well, the main thing im looking for is to have it print out the file and then exit, but without clearing the terminal
[21:36:41] <gpanders> oh, no I don't think that's possible because (n)vim uses the terminal's alternate screen buffer
[21:36:47] <gpanders> try a tool like `bat`

[23:51:30] <jackboot_> alrite, will look into that. my main issue is simply that i assume some settings im doing would have change but doing the PackerCompile doesn't seem to do it so i am trying to look into it.
[23:52:00] <jackboot_> think i was expecting some feedback of some sort :)
