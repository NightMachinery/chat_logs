[01:37:44] <hid3> Hello everyone. I've got a PC with AMD Ryzen 9 3900 CPU, currently running Ubuntu 20.04. Since some of my applicatins are (very) CPU intensive, I want this PC to perform at maximum possible performance. I've noticed in /proc/cpuinfo that the clock rate is changing even at full load. Will adjusting BIOS settings for 'max performance' increase the overall performance or should I leave it as-is, dynamically adjusting?

[09:52:10] <vatrat> I use the emacs package "spacemacs", and it has a nice auto-generated checklist like this. It's based on the user's configuration file, written in emacs-lisp, and it shows any statements that fail or succeed
[09:52:20] <jim> how would you make this splash screen? how would you start?
[09:52:45] <vatrat> I'd start by not making a splash screen, and instead making a log
[09:53:02] <jim> ok
[09:53:16] <vatrat> Prototype in python or something based on kernel output and boot output, journalctl, etc.
[09:53:29] <jim> so you wouldn't really want to make this splash screen thing?
[09:53:33] <vatrat> I always have something or other not working on my laptop
[09:53:38] <vatrat> Oh no that's the endgoal
[09:53:47] <vatrat> Right now I have a plymouth animation for a splash screen
[09:53:58] <vatrat> The idea would be a read-only TUI splash screen
[09:54:40] <vatrat> Is it currently possible? I don't know, and I don't care. I'd like to know if there's a meaningful way to subdivide and organize units of the kernel

[09:55:10] <vatrat> I'd have to look into how plymouth and the kernel's buffer do it. It probably wouldn't be suitable to ship as software, but I could write a small kernel module

The real "work" required is figuring how to get text to stay in one place while the kernel's output scrolls past

[10:03:33] <vatrat> I only came here to ask about whether someone had already thought of a way to display system status of boot-time tasks after boot
[10:03:50] <vatrat> So that way I could steal their idea and force it into the early-boot system

[10:11:47] <vatrat> I really would like help on the other part of the question though, what I'm really interested in is something to "automatically" convert boot errors to usable descriptions of system status
[10:12:06] *** Joins: fedenix (~fedenix@gateway/tor-sasl/fedenix)
[10:12:15] <espresso> i imagine a service started early could tee and parse the log etc
[10:12:28] <vatrat> The easiest thing to do, I would imagine, is just add issues one at a time based on boot errors, but that's untenable for even one kernel release, it would break constantly
[10:12:58] <vatrat> So I wanted to know if someone had already had the idea to integrate that INTO the kernel, it sounds like something that would have already been done for a different use case
[10:13:59] <vatrat> if the kernel can selectively output signals or a more easily parseable log of unrecoverable failures, that would be helpful
[10:14:00] <jim> vatrat, the alsa people have a script, alsainfo.sh, that looks at your (running) system, and prints info about your sound setup
[10:14:11] <espresso> journal messages log level should be available (warn, err)
[10:14:28] *** megeve_ is now known as megeve
[10:14:28] <jim> it might be useful to get ideas from
[10:15:18] <vatrat> espresso my thinking was that there would be too many false positives (for example, on every boot iwlwifi gives me 15 outputs of "cannot read codec capability, (-56)" and quite a few others, and I've yet to find a computer that doesn't do that)
[10:15:55] <vatrat> So if you were to do it that way, the best thing to do would be to silence those errors anyway, but I don't want to do that mostly because the absence of those errors can be telling
[10:15:58] <vatrat> Hm
[10:16:22] <espresso> there is log verbosity in kernel parameters
[10:16:27] <vatrat> Maybe you could do it by making a "baseline" output log, going through and checking what errors are serious, and then diffing the boot output from "baseline"
[10:16:34] <vatrat> that would let you detect only new errors
[10:17:14] <vatrat> espresso how would that help here exactly?
[10:17:23] <vatrat> jim I'll look
[10:18:18] <espresso> vatrat: perhaps in some hybrid solution. but your requirements are more along replacing getty ^
[10:18:23] <jim> anyway, after I was doing basic for awhile, someone gave me a lisp manual... which showed how pairs could be used to represent data... I didn't understand it at the time, but I looked through it
[10:18:47] <vatrat> espresso focus on the input requirements, output requirements are null for this time

[17:24:44] <sabousorin> 50 milions plus active downloads on play store and app store before launch it will be huge it doesn t cost nothing guys try it out one day might change you re life but before you can search on youtube or google about the project and if you like it then download pi network app and pi browser app and sign up with you re real and complete name it is
[17:24:45] <sabousorin> important later on the kyc process (know you re customer) when this will have a value to can withdraw it as the invitation code u can use sabousorin as we can mine more together.Bitcoin started like this its free and project is a layer 1 crypto like bitcoin with already big community don t miss the chance out one day you might regret it.

[21:39:41] <hexnewbie> I've considered switching to Konversation lately
[21:39:49] <johnjaye> combined with tunnelling X11 over ssh you can even use programs from different machines on other machines
[21:40:07] <johnjaye> like i can login to my linux and use the emacs from there graphically or use the one on mac or windows
[21:40:19] <newpy> johnjaye one downside to hexchat for me was not being able to show multiple windows simultaneously
[21:40:26] <johnjaye> i think i even tested android with this. but the X server i found for it wasn't that great
[21:40:35] <newpy> iirc, maybe I just didn't tinker enough to find the option
[21:40:38] <johnjaye> multiple chat windows?
[21:40:46] <newpy> split windowed channels

[23:51:04] <twainwek> does nginx need to be rebooted if the certs get updated
[23:51:14] <hexnewbie> Annoyingly, grub2 needs write access to /boot/grub/grubenv (unavailable on RAID) to use grub-reboot, so on every system where you might want to use that feature, the downgrade from lilo to grub2 meant you no longer could do â€˜lilo -R linux-newâ€™ to test a new kernel, and revert to the old one if that failed
