[00:14:27] <Guest25> Not working quite. It seems that the readuntil leaves the end char in some sort of buffer. It works for ID 1, but when i changed the ID of a working device to 4, i get the response for ID 5 without the first character, because the end characher of the response is carriage return, which makes the first char disappear,  but i don't quite get how the
[00:14:27] <Guest25> end char is left behind. I reset the string before each message.
[00:15:54] <Guest25> i mean i get the response of device 4 to message to device 5. And yes it is sending the correct message with ID 4.
[00:17:07] <Guest25> like "send message to device 4 -> no response, send message to device 5 -> message of device 4 without the first char"
[00:28:03] <Guest25> never mind, it seems this other adapter is bugging out
[00:28:53] <Guest25> the other one, better one,  seems to give the correct response with ID 4
[00:38:07] <mikko> sounds like you're struggling more with the device itself rather than julia
[00:42:57] <Guest25> the adapter, not the device
[00:45:05] <Guest25> obviously the reason i did this whole scanner was because i have couple devices for which i don't know the ID or communication speed, so i need to scan all IDs 1-99, 5 different speeds and 2 interfaces (RS-232 and RS-485), but now with the better adapter, i tested with a good device, all succesful

[00:48:45] <Guest25> and actually these few devices could be broken, cause they were part of a network (RS-485) and most of them got the RS-485 chip destroyed by over voltage. Most work with RS-232 now, but these few i don't know the situation so i need to try to scan them
[00:49:54] <Guest25> so i wanted to try Julia for making it, since i dislike the python's whitespace crap
[00:50:13] <Guest25> not that i'm any better with python

[01:33:37] <Guest25> It's not every year that i succeed in something. This is a tiny victory. I'll drink to this
