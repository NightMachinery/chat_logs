[03:31:26] <rawktucc> moo, youtube-dl + cron
[03:31:37] <moo> not as fancy!
[03:31:37] <rawktucc> just run an hourly cron job
[03:31:43] <rawktucc> what kinda fancy do you want
[03:31:48] <rawktucc> that's as fancy as it should be!!!
[03:31:56] <rawktucc> your youtube-dl config can do naming and metadata
[03:32:03] <rawktucc> there's some youtube-dl frontends that are similar to sonarr I think
[03:32:08] <rawktucc> but i cannot remember them rn
[03:32:19] <moo> graphics, thumbnails, descriptions of the episode, setting quality i want ...
[03:32:38] <moo> sorting them into proper dirs etc
[03:33:01] <rawktucc> all doable with a .conf
[03:33:10] <rawktucc> hold the horses moo!

[03:33:19] <moo> ,bef
[03:33:19] <unfinity> moo you befriended a duck in 2.806 seconds! You have made friends with 3 ducks in #datahoarder.
[03:33:25] <moo> hm i'll check
[03:33:36] <moo> btw yt-dlp is the newest youtube-dl i think? 
[03:35:05] <rawktucc> yes, you should use yt-dlp
[03:35:09] <JTL> ^
[03:35:12] <rawktucc> it's SO much better than youtube-dl
[03:35:22] <rawktucc> the multi segment downloading alone is worth it. HUGE HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE improvement
[03:35:45] <moo> also the fact that youtube-dl doesn't seem to be able to download anything from youtube anymore :d
[03:35:56] <rawktucc> there were some redesigns 
[03:35:59] <JTL> rawktucc: what's kind of bizzare is with yt-dlp I get better DL speed proxying it through a server in a datacenter thats on a shared 10Gbps port
[03:36:11] <JTL> (homelab is on a 1G/1G WAN conncetion on a different ISP)
[03:36:16] <rawktucc> D:
[03:36:33] <rawktucc> fuck, I really want 1G up. I am tempted but only Bell offers it. and it's $135 a month and I worry they'll throttle me after pushing a tiny bit of TB
[03:36:41] <rawktucc> one phone call they said "10TB is the monthly limit" even with unlimited
[03:36:47] <rawktucc> and im like "dude I have 20TB of research data to archive"
[03:38:18] <rawktucc> moo, this is the config I use https://ttm.sh/eoO.conf
[03:38:38] <rawktucc> yt-dlp --config-location ./youtube-dl.conf
[03:38:46] <moo> i only have 300 up / 1g down but they still call me every month asking me if i want to upgrade my plan. can i get 1 up? NO but you can get additional sim card for extra $10 xD 
[03:39:02] <rawktucc> grabs highest quality in VP9 format, which you may not be able to play or like versus the H264 that a lot of devices can play
[03:39:11] <moo> thanks
[03:39:39] <moo> ohh fancy -o 
[03:39:41] <moo> i likey
[03:39:41] <rawktucc> yes
[03:39:45] <rawktucc> it was a bit to get sorted
[03:40:00] <rawktucc> you may not want to do how I do, with upload_date first, but I'm so engrained into that now that it's too late
[03:40:07] <rawktucc> helps with sorting I newest I guess
[03:40:19] <rawktucc> now let me try and find that frontend I was talking about for you, for youtube-dl. something fancy
[03:40:27] <moo> i think channel name/date i would prefer but its a good starting point
[03:40:28] <moo> thanks
[03:42:47] <rawktucc> moo, if you really wanna go extra, add a git hook: https://ttm.sh/eom.txt
[03:42:57] <rawktucc> this saved my ass when my archive.txt got overwritten for some reason

[04:34:32] <joepie91> datasheet scraper am working again \o/
[04:36:36] <rawktucc> joepie91, what are you ripping?
[04:36:50] <rawktucc> scraping rather. those are pdfs
[04:37:02] <joepie91> rawktucc: http://joepie91-home.cryto.net:3500/datasheets :)
[04:37:29] <rawktucc> seek seek data sheet
[04:37:43] <joepie91> try entering a character or two :p
[04:37:53] <rawktucc> :O
[04:38:46] <joepie91> it's not yet running in prod, though that'll probably happen soon
[04:39:01] <joepie91> now that I fixed the LCSC scraper, which is Really Important, and set up a sync mechanism between the scraper and the search frontend
[04:39:18] <joepie91> so that's all the major todos ticked off
[04:39:41] <joepie91> rawktucc: did you search for something? :p
[04:39:51] <rawktucc> just some letters. i dont know any parts :(
[04:39:58] <joepie91> heh, that's fine
[04:40:11] <joepie91> rawktucc: the search is not local :p
[04:40:22] <rawktucc> it sends to your server?
[04:40:25] <joepie91> yep :)
[04:40:38] <rawktucc> backend magic
[04:40:44] <joepie91> hehehe
[04:41:09] <joepie91> one of my objectives was to make it feel local over any reasonably fast network link
[04:41:15] <joepie91> I'd say that succeeded
[04:41:25] <joepie91> the actual search time is usually under a millisecond
[04:41:53] <joepie91> and it was actually much simpler to achieve that than you might think
[04:42:03] <joepie91> it's basically just a well-placed index in PostgreSQL
[04:42:41] <joepie91> it being a prefix search only (as-you-type) means that it can use a standard index on the model numbers (albeit with some specific encoding settings) to look up the results, which is lightning fast
[04:42:43] <sarnold> neato
[04:42:56] <joepie91> I'll eventually also be adding substring-esque search, I might use a trigram index for that
[04:42:59] <sarnold> it certainly feels responsive
[04:43:07] <joepie91> which should only be a little slower
[04:43:25] <joepie91> probably as-you-type will remain prefix search, and then you can hit enter to do a substring search
[04:43:50] *** Joins: MRiddickW (~quassel@068-118-123-246.res.spectrum.com)
[04:44:07] <joepie91> usually when looking for datasheets you know the part number so a prefix search is fine
[04:44:12] <rawktucc> it's definitely responsive
[04:44:18] <rawktucc> this is pushing me to get my server setup
[04:44:31] <joepie91> only case where it's not is usually when the exact model number is ambiguous, eg. some manufacturers will call their 555s "NE555" and others will not
[04:44:41] <joepie91> so you need a substring search of some sort for that
[04:44:54] <joepie91> rawktucc: heh, this is not actually running on a server :D
[04:45:03] <joepie91> that's my desktop PC at home you're talking to!
[04:45:11] <rawktucc> i bet you have gigabit upload :(
[04:45:17] <joepie91> nah, "only" 500/500
[04:45:22] <joepie91> but the latency is the important bit :p
[04:46:09] <rawktucc> i was typing from Tor btw
[04:46:10] <joepie91> https://u.pixie.town/pixie.town/vrlvETnQcWFKmNDQYlIx9Bw0/Selection_999(978).png
[04:46:22] <joepie91> neat, so it feels fast even over Tor?
[04:46:25] <rawktucc> yes
[04:46:36] <joepie91> that's unexpected, but nice :D
[04:47:26] <joepie91> but yeah, with searches being under 1ms, there being no tracker or ad bullshit, and the client-side JS only being what is actually needed, essentially the only search latency is your network latency

[06:06:19] <rawktucc> so this is my storage server config
[06:06:46] <rawktucc> sda1-4 are: 1M BIOS BOOT, 256M /boot, 64G /, remainder /mnt or data or whatever
[06:07:11] <rawktucc> 4 drives all identical. I'll dd the first partition to every other drive and disable boot flags on them
[06:07:52] <rawktucc> /boot and / will be mirrored for changes every 5 minutes but there shouldn't be much to either run or change on the system. I've been running my server fine on 12-16GB of storage space, 64G should be more than enough for snapshots and misc stuff
[06:08:01] <rawktucc> storage partitions will be zfs pooled in zraid1
[06:08:17] <rawktucc> if one drive dies, I can rebuild boot and / from another after a replacement is installed, then resliver data

[06:23:51] <evilgohan2> the likelyhood of that is so low as to be improbable
[06:24:38] <rawktucc> are you suggesting I don't do this then?
[06:24:49] <rawktucc> I lose 256GB of space
[06:28:22] <evilgohan2> No, I'm suggesting that the loss of not one but TWO drives is unlikely.
[06:28:41] <evilgohan2> Which is not necessarily to suggest an impossibility
[06:28:47] <evilgohan2> merely an improbabiltiy
[06:28:51] <Selavi> why not just have / and /boot on a mirrored pool? that's what I do
[06:28:51] <evilgohan2> improbability*
[06:29:40] <rawktucc> Selavi, i could but it's a 4x16TB server. no additions or removals
[06:30:01] <rawktucc> oh and also because this is a lot more flexible, it's just data in this instance im doing
[06:30:11] <rawktucc> whereas in a zpool it's got the zfs stuff on top to deal with
[06:30:13] <rawktucc> or something
[06:39:03] <Selavi> can't say I understood all that, but it sounds... fair. ish. tho I gotta say it's been a while since I've heard of someone not using SSD for /
[06:41:14] <rawktucc> Selavi, it's a hetzner SX64. Unfortunatly it only comes with 4 HDDs. I could POSSIBLY do a netboot but it would be complicated and require a KVM unit which is not always free.
[06:41:16] <Selavi> you can still mirror /boot and / on a pair, then all the rest of the space can be Z1 or whatever you want, although the 2 other drives will essentially have ~64GB unused
[06:41:18] <Selavi> but whatever works
[06:41:31] <rawktucc> there was an option to add a usb stick but it was extra cost and 16GB, and that would be concerning if it fails
[06:41:36] <Selavi> ah someone else's hardware, indeed
[06:41:47] <rawktucc> yes unfortunately
[06:42:06] <rawktucc> i am quitting my job, packing up my server and things, and hitting the worldwide road later next year
[06:42:41] <rawktucc> unfortunately I can't think of anywhere to host my server reliably and affordably. colo would be expensive and I'd have to maintain it all still, plus replacement hardware.. hard to do when you're across the globe. whereas renting and managing my data is easier
[06:42:55] <rawktucc> nvme frontend with reverse proxy to hdd backend over NFS or sshfs
[06:43:01] <rawktucc> AX41 to SX64
[06:43:11] <Selavi> makes sense
[06:43:33] <rawktucc> datahoarding is a bit of a mental sickness I think. for me at least

[10:14:46] <Czernobog> Is it safe to run badblocks and smart long test at the same time?
[10:17:01] <Czernobog> Since I am using this device only as storage and not shucking it or anything(for now) the file system exFAT is fine right? afak ZFS is only used if I am doing raid and stuff. Is this correct

[18:20:10] <ThePendulum> my raspberry pi won't turn on and it's controlling my desk lamps :(
[18:20:30] <x10> running from sdcard?
[18:21:17] <ThePendulum> yeah, I was wondering if that was fried too
[18:21:28] <x10> that's usually the problem
[18:21:34] <ThePendulum> weirdly the network port was flashing before I power cycled it
[18:22:00] <x10> got home assistant running on a pi/sdcard myself that i really really need to move to something more robust

[19:01:25] <evilgohan2> Czernobog: no. granted, SMART utilities differ, long test utilities that I'm familiar with tend to perform a surface scan of the disk. You probably don't want that running at the same time as something scanning the disk for bad blocks ;)
[19:22:15] <Czernobog> evilgohan2, thought so. Anyways, I am done with badblocks and smartctl. Time to rsync some data!
