[00:01:38] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> yo doods if I have two seqs A [a,b,c,d,e] and B [a,b,c] and want another seq with all the elements of A that are not in B should I use set stuff or is there some nifty "not in" keyword
[00:02:27] <FromDiscord> <lytedev> sounds like you want a set - any reason you need a seq?
[00:02:44] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> I need to loop it later
[00:03:02] <FromDiscord> <lytedev> you can iterate over the set -- if you need to preserve order, there's even an ordered set
[00:03:30] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> hmm no handy shortcuts from keywords or sequtils? 😦
[00:03:37] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> I guess it's a fairly common operation
[00:03:44] <FromDiscord> <lytedev> what is?
[00:04:00] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> taking as a seq all the items from A not in B
[00:04:20] <FromDiscord> <lytedev> yeah that's a set thing, not really a seq thing
[00:04:51] <FromDiscord> <lytedev> you could do it, of course, but it definitely sounds like you've got the wrong data structure 😉
[00:05:04] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> well that's a given lol
[00:05:50] <FromDiscord> <geekrelief> Just use a filter
[00:06:23] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> eh I might try, it's handier than the sets?
[00:07:03] <FromDiscord> <lytedev> but... why not use sets? they're not scary, I promise
[00:07:31] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> I wanted a one liner lol, I can feel in my bones that it's easy stuff that people do all the time with a oneline lol
[00:07:55] <FromDiscord> <lytedev> if you must, you can even `for sharedElement in (mySeq.toHashSet - myOtherSeq.toHashSet):`
[00:08:44] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> hmm hash set is what people commonly refer to set?

[02:14:07] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> So solitude that issue you've showed today of `proc a[T: uint](i: T)` I think is caused because any literal smaller than the type is considered the same type, and as such the generic says "Yep this works"

[07:15:37] <FromDiscord> <Rika> you will need to make a custom type with a custom `[]`
[07:16:45] <FromDiscord> <TryAngle> is there a quick way to flatten an array?
[07:16:50] <FromDiscord> <TryAngle> dim 2 -> dim 1
[07:17:05] <FromDiscord> <Sabena Sema> OK so the type will need additional parameters to indicate the top and bottom indicies
[07:17:21] <FromDiscord> <Sabena Sema> but then ... how can I write a type that can accept _any_ range for indexing like array can?
[07:17:41] <FromDiscord> <Sabena Sema> just writing a type with a custom `[]` doesn't work since the type needs to carry the start and end indicies along with it

[07:32:12] <FromDiscord> <Sabena Sema> since in math it's traditional to index from one

[07:35:35] <FromDiscord> <Sabena Sema> zero based indexing is kinda better for the usual ways

[07:39:12] <FromDiscord> <Sabena Sema> you'll need to integrate that into the build system if you want to avoid rerunning `nim` each time

[12:55:05] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> `HANDLE` is a type is the issue
