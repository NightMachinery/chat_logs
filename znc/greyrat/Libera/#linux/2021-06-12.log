[02:22:17] <strudl> it cannot be umounted (device busy)
[02:22:19] <strudl> if i remove entries towards "faulty" VG/LVs, do systemctl daemon-reload (just to be sure) and reboot the system (so i can prune faulty vg/lvs after reboot)... as long as there will be no mount request towards the faulty VG/LVs, system should boot fine and not stuck on emergency shell?

[06:42:22] <Samian> I'm trying to run vscode remote debugger to step through code running on our gpu cluster.   To do that, vscode needs to install some extensions. The extensions cannot download because of the firewall

[09:50:06] <LSD> well the crash is caused by it not being able to do access that directory for some reason no?

[09:51:27] <FloridaMan> do you have any way to log debug stuff?

[09:51:58] <FloridaMan> I would just log everything possible and make sure that the application is crashing because of that perms error

[11:16:12] <Sauvin> baguvix: can you got into another terminal and find the hung process with a ps ?
[11:17:09] <baguvix> uhhhmmmm...yeah, but that's pretty annoying since it's a remote box so i'd have to ssh. but is there a way i can get out with the same terminal/ssh session?
[11:17:40] <Sauvin> Unless you're in screen or tmux or something, I don't know.
[11:17:50] <pnbeast> baguvix, are you saying you're ssh'd into something that you want to drop?
[11:17:58] <baguvix> no
[11:18:02] <baguvix> lemme share a pic.

[11:21:30] <Sauvin> I don't know a damn thing about lxc.
[11:22:27] <baguvix> No, It's a container, so there isn't a banlist :P But I don't think it will kick me out after multiple incorrect login attempts though. I remember trying some random user/passphrase to just get out but it keeps me in that screen again and doens't let me out.
[11:23:05] <baguvix> It's not really a lxc specific.

[11:25:27] <bradd> for debian, my bnx2x driver is failing at loading firmware. (I suppose because its non-free). Is there a debianish distro that has non-free stuff at install time?

[11:26:12] <jim> bradd, why not add contrib and non-free to the debian you have?
[11:26:31] <Sauvin> bradd: kinda depends. I use Ubuntu on new machines because of greater hardware support, but that doesn't promise your problem would be addressed.

[11:40:58] <baguvix> because even if I type `exit` on that console session, I'll be prompted to that login screen again, so shutdown is the only way out.

[14:00:38] <TJ-> Is there a way (on Debian Bullseye) to read a USB HID device's keyboard input (not raw) to stdin of a serial console? I'm sure I've done this many moons ago but cannot recall how. Scenario is needing to read output of a Yubikey (which presents as a USB HID keyboard input device) into cryptsetup launched on the serial console. Can't use the raw /dev/input/event since that is RAW data not the actual

[18:01:10] <schuelermine> Can anyone recommend any good resources for learning how to manage SSH?
[18:01:12] <schuelermine> I need to figure it out so I can configure access to a server, and the resources I’ve found so far are less than helpful…
[18:01:21] <jim> well you could... rip the cd (cdparanoia -B 1-) and play the resulting tracks?
[18:02:18] <dTal> mpv seems to make a habit of taking mplayer features and stripping or ruining them
[18:02:29] <dTal> not sure why it caught on
[18:03:06] <jim> schuelermine, there have probably been a lot of ideas for doing that kind of management... you'll want to use keys where you can...
[18:03:21] <rascul> mpv seems to play videos fine for me and it's shorter/easier to type than mplayer, but other than that i have no preference
[18:03:32] <schuelermine> Yeah, where do I learn about how keys work? It seems pretty cryptic to me…
[18:03:50] <jim> well, they are :)
[18:03:59] <jim> here's the basic deal:
[18:04:38] *** pong is now known as beaver
[18:05:08] <rascul> schuelermine the authentication section of the ssh man page might be informative
[18:05:46] <jim> you would create a key of whatever type (of which there are a small handful), and what you get when you create -one- key, is -two- files: one to hold the public half, and the other to hold the private half
[18:05:46] <schuelermine> (jim: I know the concept of pk/sk, but the cryptic part is the implementation/interface.
[18:05:48] <schuelermine> The main issue for me seems to be that I’m not sure about the distinction between an SSH client and host, or if there even is one.
[18:05:50] <schuelermine> That makes me always unsure what things need to be configured where.)

[18:08:06] <jim> again, when you are making a single key (to produce files containing each half of the same key), the generation process will ask you what file you'd like to save the key pair as
[18:09:04] <jim> it might be here, where your management of the keys start

[18:10:00] *** Joins: wyclif (~wyclif@user/wyclif)

[18:10:50] <schuelermine> remyabel: I think I’m not quite sure about the use of the keys. Do both parties need to have the keys of each other installed? Where are the keys I register with ssh-add stored, and for how long? Are they affecting what people can connect to any ssh server I’m hosting (if there were one)? Why do I need to “store” keys instead of entering them (like a password)? Are the keys machine-specific
[18:10:52] <schuelermine> (do they incorporate a fingerprint)? What’s the deal with SSH telling me that a host is unknown?

[18:14:49] <schuelermine> remyabel: So I generate a keypair on my end, the server adds my pk to the authorized_keys, I add the sk via ssh-add, and then I connect, checking if the serverside fingerprint matches?

[23:05:14] <akk> A few people have alerts for particular phrases, and most people have alerts if someone addresses them by name.
[23:06:05] <waffledogefern> if you're using a terminal-based client you could probably set it up so that when someone mentions you using your name, the username of the person that mentioned you gets highlighted

[23:10:03] <akk> If I'm in "deep hack" then I won't look at the irc window for hours at a time. But if I'm not doing anything that requires concentration I'll probably look every minute or two.
[23:10:15] <DocMors> nickpickerton, I even put earbuds with white noise in when I need to concentrate
[23:10:21] <akk> It's on the same virtual desktop as my email program.
[23:11:27] <colo> the fact that many people perceive chat applications (like MS Teams, which we use at $curjob...) as hard real-time communcation drives me close to madness sometimes.
[23:11:31] <akk> I find when I'm concentrating, I don't hear sounds much. E.g. if I have a podcast playing, but something on the computer catches my attention, I'll realize that I just missed the last 5 minutes of the podcast and need to shut it off and catch up later.

[23:42:24] *** Quits: ignis (~ignisf@user/ignis) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:42:35] <Comrade> I guess all of it. i3 isn't registering it what so ever
[23:42:45] <Comrade> I am on ubuntu rn
[23:42:48] <[[R]]> i3 is a window manager
[23:42:50] <[[R]]> what does it care about wifi?
[23:43:23] <Kyv> You don't just pass up an opportunity to say i3
[23:43:40] <Comrade> Hmmm?
[23:44:00] <Kyv> Comrade, then Ubuntu should have Network Manager and nmcli installed.
[23:44:06] <sheep> nm-applet works on i3 if you're using NetworkManager, but I'm not sure what ubuntu uses by default for wifi
[23:44:08] <Kyv> Have you been trying to use that?

[23:45:06] <Kyv> the window manager has no bearing on your internet apart from situating it the way you like on your screen.

[23:45:35] <nickpickerton> i seem to remember  nm-applet
[23:45:40] <Comrade> Kyv: I mean, I guess I know that, but, by that logic I should be able to just plug my dongle in and it be recognized like it does when I am in gnome.
[23:45:54] <waffledogefern> i keep forgetting about window managers
[23:45:58] <akk> I use nmcli on ubuntu under openbox, and agree with everybody else that networkmanager can work without help from the window manager.
[23:46:01] <[[R]]> Comrade: gnome starts extra programs, gnome doesnt care about your wifi
[23:46:08] <Comrade> It did the same thing with my xbox controller. I ended up having to set an exec when i3 launches that modprobes for my controller
[23:46:28] <Comrade> Ok, well, when I am in i3 my wifi dongle isn't working
[23:46:30] <Comrade> That's all I know
[23:46:31] <akk> But I do have to run nmcli occasionally, like for new WAPs.
[23:46:39] <Kyv> Comrade, nmcli is very straight forward
[23:47:09] <nickpickerton> (may be stupid: did you add nm-applet to i3/config: `exec --no-startup-id nm-applet`)
[23:47:12] *** Quits: ddevault (znc@sourcehut/staff/ddevault) (Quit: taking a break)
[23:47:14] <Kyv> otherwise search for the network manager gui, maybe.
[23:47:19] <akk> I'd run commands like ip/ifconfig and see if the dongle is recognized as a network device. If it is, then nmcli can probably get you going.
[23:47:23] <Comrade> Yeah I Was gonna ask about a fui
[23:47:26] <Comrade> gui*
[23:47:33] <Comrade> I didn't realize that nmcli was a cli interface
[23:47:35] <Comrade> Lol

[23:48:40] *** Quits: backleet (~mm@95.85.102.242) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[23:48:43] <Kyv> I think that nmcli can deal with all of that, but yeah, you can use ip link,etc to see the status and interface name and such.
[23:49:59] <Kyv> It would probably best to familiarize yourself with that one since it is installed already.

[23:50:22] <Kyv> And it isnt very productive to be fiddling with multiple network managers at the same time in an attempt to get one working.
[23:50:56] *** Joins: backleet (~mm@95.85.102.242)
[23:51:30] <Kyv> If for some reason you dont like dealing with it, you can disable network manager and use connman and connman-gtk for the GUI end.

[23:59:13] *** Joins: zarakshR (~Thunderbi@1.39.163.55)
[23:59:29] <akk> and a lot less complicated to get working than networkmanager in cases where nm didn't just automagically work.
[23:59:57] <[[R]]> 🎶 why you gotta go and make things so complicated...
[23:59:58] <superboot> That is really true. I used wicd on systems without X11 too.
