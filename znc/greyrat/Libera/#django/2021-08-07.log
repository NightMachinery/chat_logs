[00:17:27] <Steve-Dusty> omg guys help this is giving me brain damage https://dpaste.org/enRc . i've been stuck on this for 3 days
[00:17:47] <Steve-Dusty> https://dpaste.org/OD5s error
[00:18:00] <Steve-Dusty> I want to addTicket to add a ticket and come back
[00:18:44] <Steve-Dusty> so it'll do add_ticket ---> /dashboard/<class_id>/add_ticket/<student_id>
[00:19:01] <Steve-Dusty> and after it's done it'll go back to /dashboard/class_id
[00:19:12] <Steve-Dusty> but holy crap this logic is breaking my brain
[00:23:09] <b-rex> is that the whole add_ticket view?
[00:23:39] <b-rex> path('dashboard/<int:pk>/add_ticket/<int:student_id>',
[00:23:39] <b-rex>          add_ticket, name="class-ticket-add")
[00:24:22] <b-rex> shouldn't this be path('dashboard/<int:class_id>/add_ticket/<int:student_id>'
[00:25:29] <b-rex> and then in add_ticket view you have class_id = Class.objects.filter(pk=student_set.class_id) but there is no student_set shouldn't that just be Class.objects.filter(pk=class_id) ?
[00:26:00] <Steve-Dusty> but the rest is <int:pk?
[00:26:01] <Steve-Dusty> >
[00:26:06] <Steve-Dusty> why should this one be <int:class_id>
[00:26:27] <b-rex> and then when you return, you are sending 'pk' back to the template, but pk would be a queryset result from Class.objects.filter()
[00:26:59] <Steve-Dusty> my brain how do CBVs send pk
[00:28:09] <b-rex> afaik <int:class_id> would become a kwarg in add_ticket
[00:28:15] <Steve-Dusty> https://dpaste.org/9C8t error after changing
[00:28:57] <b-rex> you also have the positions of class_id and student_id backwards in the view declaration, not sure if this matters? my python not stronk
[00:32:35] <b-rex> using <int:pk> for the CBVs should be right but add_ticket is a FBV
[00:32:56] <b-rex> how is it to understand pk unless you tell it to?

[00:43:56] <Steve-Dusty> 1 single view is handling 2 URLs...
[00:44:15] <Steve-Dusty> my add_ticket is handling class-student-list and class-ticket-add
[00:44:36] <Steve-Dusty> so my arguments can be put for both?
[00:44:55] <Steve-Dusty> `    return redirect('class-student-list', pk=class_id, student_id=student_id, class_id=class_id)`
[00:45:10] <Steve-Dusty> like this. `pk=class_id` represents the CBV class-student-list
[00:45:25] <Steve-Dusty> `student_id` and `class_id` are arguments for class-add-ticket

[00:55:53] <b-rex> you have /dashboard/<int:pk> going to ClassDetailView

[02:46:27] <Steve-Dusty> or should I try to use `pk` for kwarg

[06:16:22] <ente_> can you recommend django for smaller projects? I may not fully understand it but everything (especially when using django rest framework) seems so overly abstracted to the point where it is not obvious what the code even does from looking at it. I knew it was "batteries included" but this just seems like "here you go create your model we'll just add the same CRUD to everything"
[06:16:54] *** Quits: chowmeined (~chowmeine@user/chowmeined) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[06:22:07] <GinFuyou> ente_, it how it usually solves many practical cases in my limited experience
[06:22:27] <GinFuyou> No idea what you imply by "smaller" projects
[06:25:30] <FunkyBob> plenty of parts of django you can simply 'not use' if you don't need them
[06:25:50] <ente_> GinFuyou: if you have a huge application with many models it may be nice to not have to write much boilerplate that's what I mean
[06:26:18] <FunkyBob> settings, models, url routing, and middleware ... are about the only bits you can't escape
[06:26:50] <FunkyBob> find CBV confusing? don't use them.
[06:27:02] <ente_> class based views?
[06:27:04] <FunkyBob> find DRF exceessive?  don't use it
[06:27:21] <FunkyBob> yes, CBV = class-based views
[06:27:39] <GinFuyou> ente_, i wrote a couple of sites that like a 1-2 pages, and one has a single custom model
[06:29:11] <ente_> GinFuyou: is using django useful when you're not doing server side rendering?
[06:29:20] <FunkyBob> yes
[06:29:23] <GinFuyou> yes
[06:29:45] <ente_> for ORM or..?

[06:29:56] <GinFuyou> =)
[06:30:06] <FunkyBob> consider
[06:30:14] <FunkyBob> a good framework aims for two things
[06:30:19] <FunkyBob> 1. to protect the developer from the tedious things
[06:30:26] <FunkyBob> 2. to protect the developer from the dangerous things
[06:30:41] <FunkyBob> django does this in many areas for web development, not just in rendering html
[06:31:19] <ente_> that are the reasons why I considered using more high-level stuff like django over gorilla/mux which is just url routing to functions
[06:31:20] <FunkyBob> parsing HTML headers correctly, sanitising user input, easy SQL query generation, url routing, request handling,
[06:31:23] <FunkyBob> lots lots more
[06:31:39] <FunkyBob> am not familiar with gorilla/mux
[06:31:43] <ente_> I may just be weirded out because it's so different
[06:31:49] <FunkyBob> perhaps
[06:32:21] <FunkyBob> one piece of advice i find is often needed for new djangonauts is ... learn to not right your tools
[06:32:31] <FunkyBob> if you feel like django is actively trying to stop you doing something some way
[06:32:38] <FunkyBob> there may be a really good reason for that
[06:33:01] <ente_> can you give an example please?
[06:34:14] <FunkyBob> someone was talking the other day about accessing querystring params directly in the template as {% if request.GET.foo %}
[06:34:18] <FunkyBob> and it stopped working
[06:34:36] <ente_> wtf
[06:34:36] <FunkyBob> on the face of it, it seems a sane and safe thing to do
[06:35:01] <ente_> that sounds like xss vulnerability imo
[06:35:13] <FunkyBob> well, it's not... because they're not rendering the field itself
[06:35:30] <FunkyBob> but, yes, they should validate the input [using a Form] and base t he template decisions off that
[06:36:33] <FunkyBob> there have been many others over time... but that was a recent one, so came to mind easily
[06:36:40] <ente_> oh ok
[06:37:09] <FunkyBob> (also, that test wasn't actually testing what they wanted to know... it was a subtle bug)

[14:12:05] <elho> Hi. How can I order the result of a distinct independ of it/after it happened?  Ie. I have .order_by('foo','bar','-date').distinct('foo','bar') working fine to get the last of each foo/bar combination, but want to sort those results by some arbitrary other field without affecting the distinct result.
[14:17:41] <elho> apparently, in SQL ony could just wrap that worknig distinct qruery in a subquery in the FROM part of SELECT tmp.* FROM (...) tmp ORDER BY tmp.field, but I faill to find any onfo on how to use Subquery() for that, all examples are with annotations putting it in other parts of the query

[21:19:20] <bytesized> I am back. Got dc in error.
[21:23:39] <PantelicGR2> bytesized: OK. Just to let you know: I haven't used Django before. I know Python and I'm interested in learning Django in the future. That's why I'm here.
[21:24:32] <bytesized> Sure PantelicGR2. Let me know if I can be of any help to you. Happy to help with whatever Django I know
[21:25:10] <PantelicGR2> ok. 🙂
[21:26:44] <GinFuyou> bytesized, what exactly is problem with microseconds? You need make queries that ignore that level of precision? You need to process it in python? Or it's just matter of presentation?
[21:29:03] <bytesized> I need queries that ignore that level of precision.

[21:31:25] <GinFuyou> So, have you tried Trunc?

[21:31:59] <bytesized> No, I have not. I will do a quick search and try it out now.

[21:50:27] <bytesized> GinFuyou, I got the desired output but it still displays with microseconds on html. So I guess, I need to figure out how to present it in 00:00:00 format.
[21:51:24] <bytesized> I used TruncSecond function

[21:58:50] <GinFuyou> Yes, it likely will produce DateTime Object in python anyway, just cut to zeros
