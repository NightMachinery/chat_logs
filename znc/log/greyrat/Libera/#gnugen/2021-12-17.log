[09:09:54] <ayekat> I know Matrix is doing all it can to somehow translate this into IRC, but at this point I'm just clicking links and parsing out lots of noise to actually read the messages
[09:10:22] <ayekat> (spoiler: I'm not clicking the links usually)
[10:14:20] <afontain[m]> Those are usually pasted messages
[10:15:18] <afontain[m]> like, logs of terminal interaction with zfs
[10:15:42] <afontain[m]> I'm not sure how they would best be translated to IRC
[10:16:23] <afontain[m]> maybe if the first line starts with an explaination ```
[10:16:23] <afontain[m]> $ echo "like this"
[10:16:23] <afontain[m]> ```
[10:16:47] <afontain[m]> ok not quite like that, it breaks the markdown
[12:10:27] <ayekat> well, multi-line messages for one, yes - but also all the "quoting for a reply" - threading/quoting isn't something that exists in IRC, so any attempt to translate that will probably end up with a clunky result at best :-/
[12:11:37] <ayekat> the alternative would probably be to have everything dumped 1-to-1 into IRC (i.e. multiple messages, one for each line), which wouldn't really be better
[12:15:13] <ayekat> but meh, don't mind me, I'm just the grumpy old guy trying to cling to ancient technologies :-D (I mean, seriously, I'm not an active member anymore, don't break a leg to make this somehow work - in the end, it's just two vastly different chat protocols)
[12:16:48] <ayekat> and I can't expect everyone to stay on IRC - after all, #gnugen is now mainly a Matrix room and no longer really an IRC channel
[12:43:56] <sparrowhawk[m]> ayekat: https://xkcd.com/1782/
[12:44:37] <ayekat> sparrowhawk[m]: yeah, that's pretty much it  xD
[13:00:19] <afontain[m]> The matrix bridge does split multiline messages up to 4 or 5 lines though. It avoids doing so for longer messages to avoid spamming I think
[13:13:16] <afontain[m]> hopefully IRCv3 arrives some day though :P
[13:17:19] <sparrowhawk[m]> hahahaha
[13:17:42] <sparrowhawk[m]> TBH, I think that since Mozilla went over to Matrix, that's not going to happen
[13:19:50] <afontain[m]> I wonder which of IRCv3 or Half Life 3 is going to happen first
[13:20:12] <sparrowhawk[m]> The Collapse will be there first
