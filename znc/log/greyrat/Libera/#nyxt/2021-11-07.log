[00:09:34] <hendursaga> I see https://discourse.atlas.engineer/t/where-is-the-download-directory-specified/285/5 but what's the best way to make it so downloads get put in directories based off of, say, URL?
[00:10:43] <hendursaga> Perhaps xdg-download-dir should be its own function and a new function defined that references it by default?
[00:10:50] <jmercouris> Perhaps
[00:11:05] <jmercouris> I have a solution to the problem, I just haven’t implemented it yet
[00:12:47] <hendursaga> Guess I'll hack something together for now

[01:17:10] <jmercouris> Well, my solution is arguably a hack
[01:25:39] <hendursaga> Well then, take auto-mode rules and adapt it, that'd be the best...

[01:36:52] <pjb> You mean "Write definitions for HALF, CUBE, and ONEMOREP using DEFUN. (The CUBE function should take a number n as input and return n3.)" ?
[01:37:26] *** Joins: taiju (~taiju@83.213.49.163.rev.vmobile.jp)
[01:37:34] <tho1efx> supposedly (apply #`cons `(t nil)) is the proper way to write this and that same #` shows up in examples in the SBCL manual but it errors out

[01:38:12] <tho1efx> to get it to work it seems I have to leave off the # like this:
[01:38:31] <pjb> An, no you mean "3.25. What do each of the following expressions evaluate to?"
[01:38:40] <tho1efx> (apply `cons `(t nil))

[01:39:45] <pjb> You must be careful when copying examples from PDF; books are typeset.  We get: (apply #’cons ’(t nil))  which is invalid CL.  You must retype it as: (apply #'cons '(t nil))   and be sure to use ' not ` !!!!!!!
[01:40:06] <pjb> Then the exercise is just a matter of feeding it to the REPL, if you can't do it by heart:  (apply #'cons '(t nil)) #| --> (t) |#
[01:40:24] <tho1efx> apostrophe not backtick?
[01:40:32] <pjb> Of course.
[01:40:50] <tho1efx> but it always worked till now
[01:40:51] <pjb> When we write (cons a d) we don't write [cons a d]. There's a reason why.
[01:41:14] <pjb> it's not because something seems to work that it's correct.
[01:41:57] <pjb> 'x and `x may evalaute to the same thing for some x, but not for all.
[01:42:18] <pjb> #'x means something, but #`x definitely doesn't mean anything (with the standard readtable).
[01:42:57] <jmercouris> What pjb said
[01:43:14] <jmercouris> Backtick has a different meaning than apostrophe
[01:43:20] <pjb> tho1efx: compare: http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/02_dc.htm with http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/02_df.htm
[01:43:37] <jmercouris> All you need to know for now is apostrophe :-)
[01:43:44] <jmercouris> The rest, don’t worry about it
[01:44:01] <tho1efx> well that explains why it didn't work
[01:45:33] <tho1efx> I really thought backtick was what the special looking marks were.  Appreciate the guidence both of you.
[01:50:37] <tho1efx> Why can I get away without the # though?
[01:52:17] <pjb> tho1efx: oh, but it works with '!
[01:52:29] <pjb> (apply 'cons '(t nil)) #| --> (t) |#   (apply #'cons '(t nil)) #| --> (t) |#
[01:52:34] <pjb> But it doesn't mean the same thing!
[01:52:51] <pjb> tho1efx: notably it will make a difference in some cases.
[01:53:34] <pjb> (defun foo (x) (list 'outer x))    (flet ((foo (x) (list 'inner x)))   (list (apply 'foo '(42)) (apply #'foo '(42)))) #| --> ((outer 42) (inner 42)) |#
[01:53:52] <tho1efx> it works with both ` and ' if I omit the #
[01:54:06] <pjb> tho1efx: but since cons is a symbol from the CL package, and since we don't have the right to redefine it, even with flet, it cannot make a difference.
[01:54:21] <pjb> tho1efx: again, depends on what the x is.
[01:54:34] <tho1efx> flet doesnt mean anything too me other than that ive seen it mentioned in the docs
[01:54:59] <pjb> tho1efx: (let ((v 42))  `(foo ,v)) #| --> (foo 42) |#     (let ((v 42))  '(foo ,v)) #| ERROR: Reader error on #<string-input-stream  :closed #x302003E9EDBD>:
[01:54:59] <pjb> Comma not inside backquote |#    (let ((v 42))  '(foo v)) #| --> (foo v) |#
[01:55:39] <pjb> tho1efx: yes, that's why some things seem to be the same for you now. You've not expanded your universe enough for the particules to have coaleased into different states.
[01:56:19] <pjb> At the early stages of the bigbang, even the fundamental forces weren't differentiated. ` was the same as '.
[01:57:47] <tho1efx> That's a stereotypical lisper statement if i've ever read one.  :P
[01:57:50] <tho1efx> is there a way to have my emacs/slime/sbcl environment show the differences to me?
[01:58:56] <tho1efx> C-c C-d C-d is letting me down
[02:05:55] <tho1efx> Thanks again for the assist
[02:09:47] <pjb> (get-macro-character #\') vs.  (get-macro-character #\`)
[02:10:20] <pjb> Then M-. on the name of each function should show you the source, and make the differences clear.
[02:10:40] <pjb> Otherwise read chapter 2 of clhs, links above.

[19:05:40] <mariari> what does C-a do for you?
[19:05:50] <mariari> I have this extra keys, but I think C-a doesn't go to the start of line for you rigth?
[19:06:45] <aartaka> mariari: No, it selects all the input text.
[19:07:04] <mariari> Yeah do you have a key that goes to the start of the prompt
[19:07:20] <mariari> yeah I see why now
[19:07:42] <aartaka> What you want is rather `nyxt/prompt-buffer-mode:select-first`, I believe.
[19:08:01] <mariari> yeah can you try running that?
[19:08:08] <mariari> I have
[19:08:09] <mariari> "C-a" 'select-first
[19:08:11] <mariari> bound
[19:13:38] <aartaka> mariari: Bugs exactly as you described. Using `nyxt/prompt-buffer-mode:select-first` instead of `select-first` fixes it.
[19:16:04] <mariari> let me try using that and last
[19:16:35] <mariari> and I'm guessing nyxt/prompt-buffer-mode:mark-all as well
[19:17:04] <mariari> ahh intersting
[19:17:11] <mariari> that marks the minibuffer itself and not the text commands
[19:17:24] <mariari> and that selects all the buffers
[19:40:01] <mariari> thank you aartaka
[19:48:01] <aartaka> meriari: You're welcome :)
