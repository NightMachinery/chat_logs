[00:27:15] <bobdobbs`> adam12: thank you! I'll experiment with one or both of those

[02:27:48] <weaksauce> are you using a gemfile?
[02:27:51] <weaksauce> can you gist that
[02:27:54] <weaksauce> and the lock
[02:28:43] <adam12> bobdobbs`: you also need to ensure bundler is being used. either via `bundle exec` or by requiring `bundler/setup`.
[02:29:18] <bobdobbs`> Gemfile: http://pastie.org/p/6LB9IHYN5Njt8ZGoe5B3pK
[02:29:55] <bobdobbs`> lock: http://pastie.org/p/1EoTkfGQoAQWOOnC2VcCX6
[02:29:58] <adam12> I'd just use the `tty` gem
[02:30:18] <adam12> and leave off `tty-prompt` from the Gemfile, since `tty` is a meta gem with all the deps.
[02:30:24] <bobdobbs`> ok
[02:31:23] <bobdobbs`> tbh, I'm not entirely clear what bundle does
[02:31:27] <bobdobbs`> *bundler
[02:32:07] <adam12> bobdobbs`: Specifies specific versions of gem dependencies, and sets up the correct loadpaths for them.
[02:32:30] <bobdobbs`> ah, ok. I'm looking at bundler.io now
[02:32:41] <adam12> bobdobbs`: So you can have 3 copies of tty installed (v1, v2, v3) and your Gemfile will say `tty v2`, which bundler will ensure you use (instead of v1 or v3 which may be incompatible)
[02:33:47] <bobdobbs`> ah ok
[02:34:46] <bobdobbs`> So I'm guessing that when I installed tty, Gem installed multiple versions of pastel. And when I run the 'require', ruby sees two different packages and doesn't know which one to use. Is that right?
[02:35:39] <adam12> bobdobbs`: Right. It sounds like either tty-prompt was the issue, or you weren't using bundler (by the 2 methods I mentioned above).
[02:37:42] <bobdobbs`> k. I'm looking at this documentation now: https://bundler.io/v2.2/guides/bundler_setup.html
[02:41:56] <bobdobbs`> k, if I have a script that just has this line and nothing else: require 'bunder/setup'... then I get this: http://pastie.org/p/5GfT5vJ4tSe67GEN5EGq8v
[02:44:15] <weaksauce> does it work with ruby 3?
[02:44:25] <bobdobbs`> I'm using ruby 3.0.2
[02:44:32] <weaksauce> yeah i mean is the gem compatible 
[02:44:56] <bobdobbs`> oh, good question
[02:45:10] <bobdobbs`> I actually don't know. I'll try to find out
[02:52:38] <bobdobbs`> I can't see anything their website or their main git page about compatibility
[03:07:06] <weaksauce> it *should* be compatible but who knows
[03:12:29] <bobdobbs`> well, at this point I can't figure out how to load it. So I'm googling for an alternative
[03:14:51] <weaksauce> maybe check out the dry-rb project
[03:14:54] <weaksauce> they might have something 
[03:14:57] <weaksauce> or google awesome ruby
[03:15:10] <bobdobbs`> thanks. will check those out

[05:06:22] <adam12> bobdobbs`: Your error makes it seem bundler isn't being used, for whatever reason.
[05:07:10] <bobdobbs`> oh. So bundler has to called within the script?
[05:07:38] <adam12> bobdobbs`: No. I just did that to simplify things.
[05:07:59] <bobdobbs`> ah, ok
[05:08:00] <adam12> bobdobbs`: If I had a Gemfile, Gemfile.lock, in the same folder as my file, I'd just call `require "bundler/setup"`, and then `require "cli-ui"`. Nothing more.
[05:08:27] <adam12> See my comment on that gist, if it's unclear.
[05:12:54] <bobdobbs`> I think I see what you are getting it
[05:13:16] <John_Ivan> (offtopic) - https://img.devrant.com/devrant/rant/c_1351259_cjEYe.jpg
[05:13:21] <John_Ivan> made me laugh. a lot.
[05:13:45] <bobdobbs`> So on my system, if run your first script, then I get what it is both expected and desired: the terminal prints OHAI
[05:14:47] <bobdobbs`> and if I run the contents of your comment as a script, I get the "cannot load such file..." message, and no "OHAI"
[05:15:01] <bobdobbs`> But I should get the same result from both right?
[05:15:14] <bobdobbs`> Which means something in my system configuration is borked
[05:15:32] <adam12> bobdobbs`: You have a Gemfile, Gemfile.lock?
[05:15:38] <bobdobbs`> yes to both
[05:15:40] <adam12> (the .lock is auto-generated)
[05:15:43] <adam12> and the file is in the same dir?
[05:15:47] <bobdobbs`> yesa
[05:15:57] <adam12> Something seems odd, for sure.
[05:16:09] <adam12> Can you put all 3 files together in a gist? and I'll look
[05:16:20] <bobdobbs`> sure thing...
[05:16:42] <bobdobbs`> well, I'd prefer to use pastie, if that's ok
[05:17:15] <adam12> bobdobbs`: sure. gist supports multiple files but whatever works.
[05:18:08] <bobdobbs`> http://pastie.org/p/2VPGrDiACl5KvwnK2cq5QG
[05:19:59] <adam12> bobdobbs`: There's no `require "bundler/setup"` at the beginning of your script.
[05:20:23] <bobdobbs`> Yes. I wasn't sure that was necessary
[05:20:54] <bobdobbs`> And I still get the same failure if it is included
[05:22:05] <adam12> https://gist.github.com/adam12/f5cb644b9a3cda155c83de385a6de483
[05:22:06] <adam12> new gist
[05:24:46] <bobdobbs`> adam12: hey, that one worked!
[05:25:08] <bobdobbs`> lol. I am so confused now
[05:25:32] <bobdobbs`> oooooooooooooh
[05:25:42] <bobdobbs`> ok, the prognosis is that I'm a dumbass
[05:26:19] <adam12> Yeah, the require needed to be adjusted for `cli/ui` too.
[05:26:43] <adam12> Ruby uses $LOAD_PATH to find requires. It's basically a big Array with every gem root on it.
[05:26:49] *** Joins: Al2O3 (~Al2O3@user/al2o3)
[05:27:18] <adam12> When you say `require "foo"`, it goes to each folder in $LOAD_PATH and says, does dir/foo.rb exist? If so, require. Rinse. Repeat.
[05:27:26] <bobdobbs`> soooo... simply asking for the library that exists instead of the one that doesn't exist made the difference
[05:27:55] <bobdobbs`> thanks adam12 
[05:28:13] <adam12> So when bundler sets up the load paths, it sets up the path to `cli-ui/lib`. When you do "require "cli/ui"`, it's basically looking eventually for cli-ui/lib/cli/ui.rb. If you look at the gem source, you can see they have a lib/cli/ui.rb file. That's their entry point.
[05:28:24] <adam12> bobdobbs`: Cool.
[05:28:26] <bobdobbs`> that makes sense

[22:02:19] <havenwood> adam12: Seems super promising. Love it. Too many issues still to really adopt but so cool.
[22:02:44] <havenwood> Feel like getting Steep IDE integration for free...
[22:03:49] <havenwood> adam12: Like it doesn't understand the splat yet and thinks `[*'a'..'z']` is a Array[Range[String]], which then makes for strange issues.
[22:04:18] <havenwood> Still, magical.
[22:07:09] <adam12> Neat. I'm eager to try it.

[23:46:57] <LACampbe1> thanks Adam. didn't solve my problem but FileList is useful in its own right
[23:54:11] <LACampbe1> basically patsubst is like a more powerful gsub, in that it allows you to replace a pattern with another pattern, ie (patsubst input/%.a, output/%.b). Ie all the file paths that have an input and extension a, get changed to output with extension b. AFAIK this requires multiple calls to gsub in ruby
