[04:46:07] <artao> i actually prefer blind russians heh heh
[04:46:11] <maplefinger> ive got brain-poisoning from trolling white supremacists, which I just realized with the number of times I saw "white russian" in here
[04:46:11] <artao> no. i prefer white
[04:46:16] <artao> blind russians are dangerous
[04:46:23] <artao> lol
[04:46:28] <artao> why bother?
[04:46:36] <artao> what? white russian in there?
[04:46:40] <artao> hm
[04:46:41] <maplefinger> long form con
[04:46:41] <artao> o.O
[04:46:49] <maplefinger> on libera, formerly freenode
[04:46:58] <maplefinger> im in their group, but as an irritant
[04:47:04] <artao> i hope freenode is dying horribly
[04:47:15] <maplefinger> one guy whent there on accident the other day
[04:47:16] <artao> well ...... enjoy i guess
[04:47:21] <maplefinger> I mocked him for it
[04:47:35] <artao> just out of curiousity .... what's the channel? #whitesupremacy?
[04:47:36] <maplefinger> "hey I said it was an accident, anyway, nobody's there, and no login was required"
[04:47:36] <artao> lol
[04:47:40] *** Joins: morlog (~morlog@user/morlog)
[04:47:42] <artao> i'd think libera wouldn't allow that
[04:47:50] <maplefinger> allow what
[04:48:00] <artao> i'd go so far to say they even SHOULDN'T
[04:48:04] <artao> white supremacy channels
[04:48:09] <TomatoSynth> seems freenode guy was a real douche. did libera exist before the shit hit the fan?
[04:48:09] <maplefinger> oh
[04:48:10] <morlog> they dont
[04:48:18] <maplefinger> no TomatoSynth
[04:48:24] <maplefinger> it was created as a refuge from the shit
[04:48:28] <artao> yeah. s. korean guy. trump supporter iirc
[04:48:34] <artao> i think he bought it to destroy it
[04:48:39] <TomatoSynth> thats what i thought. someone said something above that seems to contradit that, my b.
[04:48:45] <maplefinger> i have some bad news about libera
[04:48:56] <artao> libera is freenode prior to that purchase
[04:48:58] <maplefinger> they're fine with certain forms of bigotry, but not others
[04:49:08] <artao> elaborate
[04:49:08] <maplefinger> still better than letting bigots run rampant
[04:49:24] <TomatoSynth> maplefinger, what bigotry do you think they "allow"
[04:49:39] <artao> bigotry against racists? heh heh
[04:49:43] <morlog> political
[04:50:01] <maplefinger> what has become obvious to me, a non-coder and non-developer but lover of chat in general, is that most of our modern society relies on obscure libraries maintained by people who skew heavier than the population average towards LGBT
[04:50:23] <maplefinger> they dont skew black or mexican or color
[04:50:35] <maplefinger> so... the tolerance on network is related to this reality.
[04:50:36] <morlog> dont know about that
[04:50:42] <maplefinger> I do
[04:50:45] <morlog> some really racist coders out there
[04:50:47] <maplefinger> who is ariadne
[04:50:57] <maplefinger> you're proving my point
[04:51:11] <morlog> how
[04:51:38] <maplefinger> they crack down on sex-related bigotry but not racial bigotry
[04:51:41] <maplefinger> thought that was obvious
[04:52:04] <maplefinger> because a lot of them identify as something other than cis/straight whatever
[04:52:11] <TomatoSynth> then that is not good, if what you say is right. is there seriously a white supremacy channel? 
[04:52:18] <maplefinger> no
[04:52:24] <maplefinger> there's a bunch where it's fine
[04:52:44] <maplefinger> antivax is allowed on network, too, as you know.
[04:52:57] <morlog> how about we get back to music talk in here
[04:53:00] <maplefinger> not complaining, just noticing.
[04:53:06] <TomatoSynth> okay then like what, have you personally been called a slur on this thing? i see irc as much more regulated for this sort of thing than you're leading on
[04:53:32] <TomatoSynth> antivax has a LOT of crossover with white supremacy my fren
[04:53:38] <maplefinger> ok back to White Russians :D

[07:37:56] <morf> i don't think we have any russian shit left
[07:37:57] <artao> but NOO)OOOO
[07:37:59] <artao> 4pm

[08:12:03] <maplefinger> Die Hard really is a Christmas movie, the name of the villain, Hans Gruber, (played by Alan Rickman) is play on the name of the author of the song Silent Night (Franz Gruber).
[08:12:10] <morf> "_
[08:12:15] <morf> :)
[08:12:17] <morf> well ofc it is
[08:12:24] <morf> 1 & 2

[08:12:47] <artao> nope
[08:12:48] <morf> and it's literally xmas movie
[08:12:55] <morf> bcs it was release before xmas
[08:12:58] <morf> as xmas movie
[08:13:00] <morf> sorry mate :) 
[08:13:16] <artao> xmas is BARELY part of it. it's 100% incidental. that movie could take place ANY time of year and it wouldn't matter
[08:13:38] <artao> an xmas movie is a movie about xmas
[08:13:47] <artao> die hard is a robbery action movie
[08:13:56] <artao> that takes place during xmas
[08:14:08] <morf> it's actually summer movie
[08:14:10] <artao> AND is resolved before xmas
[08:14:11] <morf> what do you know
[08:14:19] <artao> i know movies
[08:14:19] <morf> Die Hard's premiere took place on July 12, 1988, at the Avco theater in Los Angeles, California.
[08:14:36] <morf> but they did it so wrong
[08:14:43] <morf> that should be movie to go out before xmas
[08:14:44] <artao> yeah. so much for "xmas movie" LOL
[08:14:55] <artao> july 12 xmas
[08:15:00] <maplefinger> Sos Labyrinth
[08:15:04] <morf> it is still
[08:15:05] <artao> what?

[08:16:05] <maplefinger> i did nazi any
[08:16:15] <maplefinger> you're thinking of Top Secret
[08:16:22] <artao> Labyrinth is one of the most honest movies about the Fae

[08:42:59] <artao> mist-ice and black-ice are THE MOST DANGEROUS winter things. especially with thick fog
[08:43:26] <artao> not even 300m visibility
[08:50:30] <artao> MOST of you don't even know what black ice is
[08:50:44] <sdragon> I know what black ice is
[08:50:52] <artao> it's SUPER dangerous
[08:50:57] <artao> you can't see it

[08:51:17] <artao> sdragon you ever hit black ice?
[08:51:22] <artao> WOW it's scary

[08:52:31] <artao> you don't see it, then you hit it, and if the car isn't going straight forward you're kinda fucked
[08:52:40] <artao> UNLESS you know how to drive on ice
[08:52:58] <artao> which is FAR more difficult than simply driving in sno9w
[08:53:01] <sdragon> Don't lock your brakes
[08:53:06] <artao> i had a near death experience one
[08:53:16] <artao> well, sometimes you NEED to lock your brakes
[08:53:19] <sdragon> You'll turn your car into a sled
[08:53:33] <artao> driving in ice and snow takes a LOT of practice. and it's car specific
[08:53:58] <artao> sometimes you need to do brake-gas-brake-gas gas -brake
[08:54:14] <sdragon> Yeah, alternate
[08:54:28] <artao> I was in an 80s Mustang with tires so bad you could see the wires in them
[08:54:51] <artao> i was on my way to my probation officer and got the a road part with a long turn with no camber
[08:55:12] <artao> my car started drifting to the opposite lane, with a semi-truck coming at me

[08:55:27] <artao> i have NO IDEA what i did. I just trained enuf to do the right thing
[08:55:56] <artao> I ended up facing the opposite direction parked perfectly on the side of the road as the truck rushed past
[08:56:10] <artao> i couldn't let go of the steering wheel for like 5 mnin

[09:04:54] <artao> and them places near Lake Superior? FUCK
[09:05:06] <artao> 10+ft of snow, plus wind driven ice
[09:05:58] <artao> places up0 north literally have house exits on their 2nd floor
[09:06:24] <artao> Lake Superior tho? you don't fuck with that shit
[09:07:05] <artao> it actually gets colder down here by me (like 43N) they still have air currents keeping shit "warm" up north
[09:07:16] <artao> down here tho? yeah. we get the REALLY arctic air
[09:07:32] <artao> we've been hittin -40C/-40F for many years no
[09:07:36] <artao> straight temp
[09:08:05] <artao> wind chill? sometimes to -60F (-51C)

[09:08:58] <artao> we're nearly arctic
[09:09:09] <artao> actually colder than alaska
[09:09:47] <artao> even Antarctica cold, but we don't get their extreme winds

[09:11:20] <artao> i posit that Wisconsin/Minnesota/Michigan have the largest temp range in the world

[09:11:57] <artao> that fuckin lake man. that fuckin lake
[09:12:05] <artao> DEADLY on many levels
[09:13:37] <artao> i ain't jokin

[09:14:04] <artao> we're legit one of the coldest places on the planet
[09:14:13] <artao> and yet we also get over 100F
[09:14:27] <artao> so we're also the largest temp range on the planet
[09:14:29] <louipc> kool
[09:14:37] <artao> very cold cool
[09:14:49] <artao> over 120 degrees difference

[09:21:44] <sdragon> So what you're saying is,
[09:21:48] <sdragon> It gets cold
[09:21:52] <sdragon> ?
[09:22:03] <artao> not to mention ice storms which coat power/telephone lines AND their support columns in like 1/4" of ice
[09:22:12] <artao> not just cold, but also icey
[09:22:24] <artao> snow and ice
