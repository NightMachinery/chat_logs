[03:43:24] <tammy> I'm trying to sopy user profiles, 5555 of them, so that's a lot of things to chown
[03:45:14] <tammy> perhaps there is a windows rsync tool that might work cleaner that I should be using...
[03:46:10] <sarnold> heh, sorry, I meant, if you chown a thing over smb do you get an error message? or does it work?
[03:46:17] <sarnold> ie, is it expected to work at all?
[03:46:47] <sarnold> I haven';t done smb in ~20 years, and I don't recall doing those sorts of operations over the mounts
[03:49:02] <tammy> says root owns the files in both source and destination... Maybe what I'm trying to accomplish can't be done with the way it's currently mounted...
[03:50:18] <sarnold> fight this simple thing before fighting the 5555 case thihng :)
[03:51:08] <tammy> perhaps I should be looking to a native windows tool like XCOPY to accomplish this more simply.

[05:51:56] <sarnold> tammy: woot :) i hope the cleanup effort iisn't too bad
[06:02:27] <tammy> it's not too bad. it is simply using the parant dir to force ownership back down the tree, which might take a while based on file/folder count, and then rerunning the sync (which I have to do anyways) and excluding owner, rather letting ownership be inherrited as is typically is, then re-syncing the parents inherritted permissions. After that everything appears to be clones of the source and I
[06:02:30] <tammy> should be able to tell my service to use the new server for it's user profiles.

[06:02:44] <tammy> ,bang
[06:02:44] <unfinity> tammy you shot a duck in 8.267 seconds! You have killed 235 ducks in #datahoarder.
[06:04:15] <sarnold> do you have to worry about your users fiddling with their files in the meantime and mucking everything up?
[06:06:25] <tammy> Not really, and it's profiles for Citrix XenApp, so there isn't/shouldn't be anything to critcal that they may lose. the typical dirs like desktops/downloads/documents/pics/music/vid are already being redirected to their personal network storage shares. So really we're talking about anything outside of those, heaviest hitter being the APPDATA folder.
[06:07:56] <tammy> the BIGGEST lesson to be learned here is this: If you have a big ol expensive hpe 3par san... DO NOT EVER(!!!!) use the built in NAS they offer called FILE PERSONA. IT BLOWS ASS AT SCALE>
[06:09:03] <sarnold> ow ow ow owwww :(
[06:09:07] <tammy> the administrator before me had citrix PVS (Server VDI images) running off it as well as user profiles....
[06:09:15] <sarnold> I've heard stories about those big expensive file server "solutions"
[06:10:03] <tammy> hpe 3par has been quite reliable and efficient and very good quality for us. Just not this built in File Persona... it gets a big NOPE from me.
[06:10:39] <tammy> it's basically a NAS solution that is built right into the 3par storage solution.

[06:11:17] <tammy> It's much better to just carve out the storage and stand up and VM and fiberchannel the disks to the VM. WAY WAY WAY BETTER
[06:11:51] <sarnold> interesting
[06:12:05] <sarnold> I wonder what makes the difference
[06:14:03] <tammy> I haven't done any stress testing to id exactly where the issue is because I have real world XP of seeing it be dicks. But I think it's lacking in IO. At night it seems faster and during peak user laod in my citrix environment it has issues with file enumeration.
[06:14:59] <tammy> like I said, we got 5555 folders in the profiles directory, and it takes it about a good 2-3 minutes to build the list of all the folder names if you ask it to, from any windows OS or linux OS.
[06:16:11] <sarnold> 46 per second.. not super-fast :)
[06:16:33] <tammy> I know that w10 based systems take a long time to list out folders when you get into the multiple thousands, and windows confirms that's a known issue they refuse to address, but this File persona serves up the same issue to any OS type asking it to list the folders.
[06:16:57] <tammy> let's say 2 minutes for 5555 folders
[06:17:52] <tammy> Windows says it has something to do with checking one of the .ini files in each folder. which I think is dogwater. Just list the friggin names, I don't need to know any info about the contents of the folders themselves of if they are setup ot have a certain view or anything...

[06:18:40] <tammy> more reason to move to unix servers I guess.

[19:21:37] <imMute> is anyone familiar with backblaze?  is there a way to see "recently added/changed/deleted files"?  I know you can see history, but that requires you already know which files may have changed.  I have a drive that may have been corrupted and want to know what's changed recently to see if anything is corrupted and needs restoring
