[00:04:16] <andyandybobandy> I'm not sure, but maybe. I never got around to properly exploring those projects
[00:04:29] <andyandybobandy> I think so...
[00:07:11] <danielsh> *nod*
[00:07:30] <danielsh> if someone wanted to set up one of those, with bidirectional email integration so people interact with tickets via email, that might be a way forward
[00:07:47] <danielsh> we could set up a zsh-bugs@ list to experiment with, if need be

[00:42:40] <phy1729> danielsh, dana: Aside from my terrible js, css, design skills, thoughts? https://gist.github.com/phy1729/8b312472c118214107ae8457c8ca7368
[00:44:33] <danielsh> phy1729, hint that "Enable completion" is probably what you want to choose
[00:44:51] <danielsh> explain what extended globs are (*brief* example + docs link)
[00:45:06] <danielsh> make it clear that one needn't answer all questions
[00:45:09] <phy1729> Yeah should have some intro material that when in doubt choose the first one maybe. and yes need to add descriptions
[00:46:07] *** Quits: snowyforest (~bluestar@snowglobe.student.rit.edu) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:46:11] <danielsh> in "History: sharing" none of the radio buttons restore the state before any of them was selected
[00:46:30] <phy1729> Yeah, I don't think the default is reasonable or ever really wanted
[00:46:32] *** Joins: snowyforest (~bluestar@snowglobe.student.rit.edu)
[00:46:44] <danielsh> UX, though
[00:46:50] <danielsh> "How do I Ctrl+Z selecting that radio button?"
[00:46:55] <phy1729> I suppose I need to figure how to nest some choices under other choices
[00:47:04] <danielsh> "Where's the manual for the form I"m using so I don't have to read a manual"?
[00:47:08] <phy1729> I might just start with the first selected for each
[00:47:20] <danielsh> set 'disabled' ? 
[00:47:42] <phy1729> I mean you shouldn't get history sharing if you aren't saving history
[00:48:09] <danielsh> yeah that should be greyed out in that case
[00:48:16] <phy1729> and I should add a box for disabling ^ if you enable extglob
[00:48:21] <danielsh> anyway, kudos for getting your hands dirty :) 
[00:48:41] <phy1729> "It can't be _that_ hard"  oh right js and css
[00:49:45] <phy1729> I'm generating it from a yaml file that has the choices to make and the options
[00:51:49] <phy1729> Should go through zsh 4 humans and see what things it sets

[13:43:27] <dana> phy1729: yeah needs some refinement obv but i think a web-based configurator isn't a bad idea
[13:44:06] <dana> https://geoff.greer.fm/lscolors/ i've used this a few times

[13:45:55] <dana> the most irritating thing is having to re-implement all of the names and descriptions, that makes it annoying to keep up to date
[13:46:13] <dana> though i suppose that kind of stuff doesn't change that often
[13:46:56] <Mikachu> good tool for the 80s when terminals only had 8 colors
[13:47:31] <dana> how many colours can you easily distinguish
[13:47:36] <Mikachu> more than 8
[13:48:12] <dana> rembrandt over here
[13:48:46] <Mikachu> just realized it's weird dircolors is called dircolors, dirs only have one color usually while files have plenty
[13:50:00] <dana> maybe they meant it in the sense of a 'file directory'

[14:07:59] <Mikachu> funny that to this day grep --color corrupts output by default
[14:08:27] <Mikachu> if a matched word ends on the final column, it is summarily erased
[14:08:33] <Mikachu> the final character of it, that is
[14:09:18] <dana> i don't think i've ever noticed that
[14:09:29] <Mikachu> i added a patch for it but at some point i lost it, just restored it now
[14:10:28] <Mikachu> seems it works in xterm now too, used to be an urxvt extension...
[14:11:50] <Mikachu> not documented in ctlseqs.txt though, odd, maybe i'm missing something
[14:15:10] <dana> both gnu and bsd grep do that for me
[14:15:13] <dana> but not ripgrep!
[14:16:34] <Mikachu> ah, when you use the extension in xterm it's just a no-op so it clears nothing at all, that's why it appeared to work lol
[14:17:04] <Mikachu> \e[K clears "to the end of the line" but when you're in the final column, the cursor doesn't advance, so you erase the current character too
[14:17:16] <Mikachu> urxvt has the extension \e[3K to not erase the current character in this specific case
