[06:18:57] *** Joins: klovett (~klovett@107.116.92.97)
[06:22:42] <mdhughes> CHICKEN is R5RS+, not R7. Gambit's just barely R7 now. But CHICKEN has a massive library, Gambit's faster but you're gonna be making everything you want to use in it.
[06:23:33] <mdhughes> I've written FFI code in both; CHICKEN isn't even FFI, it's just C. You write C and it works. Gambit's OK, but is harder translation layer.
[06:26:31] <nytpu> mdhughes: chicken has the r7rs egg which is what i'm currently using, it's pretty nice. i was just wondering because gambit claims to have a native r7rs mode (albeit recently implemented) rather than a translation layer

[20:01:27] <amazigh> sjamaan: I was considering the layer unsyntax on top chicken, wdyt?
[20:02:09] <sjamaan> ?
[20:02:43] <amazigh> (the full story is that I had troubles with mit-scheme and chicken wrt to R7RS libraries, and thought that using unsyntax to produce chicken and mit code would be a better use of my time, but since scheme-live is apparantly dead...)
[20:02:50] <amazigh> sorry!
[20:03:00] <amazigh> I will try again:
[20:03:03] <sjamaan> What's scheme-live and what is unsyntax?
[20:03:08] <amazigh> ok
[20:03:35] <sjamaan> Sorry for the stupid questions, I've been a bit out of the loop I guess
[20:03:58] <amazigh> unsyntax is a project by mnieper that converts a R7RS program to a R7RS program that does not need macro support of any kind
[20:04:00] <amazigh> https://www.unsyntax.org/
[20:04:04] <amazigh> nvm
[20:05:27] <sjamaan> ahh, like ye olde alexpander
[20:05:28] <amazigh> scheme-live was somesort of collection of libraries that wanted to support many libraries on top of many scheme implementations
[20:05:52] <sjamaan> k
[20:05:54] <amazigh> sjamaan: yes! sort like alexpander, it is targeting a subset R7RS which is imo a mistake but 
[20:06:03] <sjamaan> Anyway, gtg
[20:06:11] <sjamaan> I'll be back on Monday
[20:06:26] <sham1> So one could call it a macro expander
[20:07:21] <amazigh> sjamaan: see you around.
[20:08:03] <amazigh> sham1: yes, that is correct, but it still requires some support for R7RS libraries at this time
[20:08:43] <amazigh> albeit minimal R7RS define-library support. I need to ask MNW when he will be back, why he choosed that approach
[20:10:22] <Zipheir> sjamaan: Thanks for taking a look.  It would be a nice fix, some day.  Enjoy your weekend :)
[20:11:13] <Zipheir> amazigh: Is MNW unavailable?  He just sent off some SRFI feedback.
[20:11:43] <amazigh> he is not here on IRC?
[20:13:06] <Zipheir> Oh, no, he isn't.

[20:55:56] <fizzie> amazigh: It uses a (variable-length) n-gram language model, yes. Mostly trained with https://vsiivola.github.io/variKN/ although the IRC style predates me using that. Also, it's using a novel-to-me (although I'm sure someone's come up with it independently) data structure I've been calling a "reverse context tree" to make it easy to use variable-length models generatively.
