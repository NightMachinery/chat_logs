[00:53:02] <bpalmer> some things in elisp favor a more functional style; for example, elisp itself doesn't have a native 'return' form, to return early from a function.
[00:53:50] <bpalmer> so the language encourages you to express the function with natural endpoints

[04:47:33] <bobdobbs> That's cool and all. And I might just leave things things there. But at some point I should probably figure out how package-install works
[04:47:34] <MysteriousSilver> does `M-x package-install` work fine too?
[04:47:53] <bobdobbs> kiiiiinda
[04:49:02] <bobdobbs> Like, the package I wanted to install is now installed. But after reloading my old config, if I do "package-install [name of the package I was looking for before and ended up installing while my own init was parked]" ... then the package manager cannot find that package
[04:49:08] <bobdobbs> even though it's installed now
[04:49:22] <grym> s/kiiiiinda/not really/g
[04:49:55] <bobdobbs> So my guess was that my customised init had some instructions for package-install. 
[04:50:01] <bobdobbs> But if it does, I can't find them

I tried doing that by adding (lambda () (pop-to-buffer (current-buffer))) to 'Man-mode-hook, and that works the first time I open a manual entry. 'q' seems to keep the buffers around, so the next time I want to open the same manpage the focus stays in my current window.
[11:23:00] <kenran> How should I best proceed? I could try making 'q' in a Man buffer to kill it instead of just quitting the window, but I feel like I could well run into the same problem with other modes again and would love to know how if there's a more general way to have this behaviour ("focusing a SOME-MODE buffer when it pops up").

[15:27:52] <djm> The behaviour of M-. in Clojure mode (with cider and lsp) has changed for me, to use lsp instead of cider; I think the order of lsp--xref-backend and cider--xref-backend has switched in xref-backend-functions (the lsp one is first now; presumably it wasn't before)
[15:28:18] <djm> What's the fix? cider-mode.el has (add-hook 'xref-backend-functions #'cider--xref-backend nil 'local) - should I re-run that with a different depth?

[21:22:32] <winny> johnjay: weechat offers both connecting over a simple tcp socket or websocket (think of this is a tcp socket over http).  Previously have used a boring tcp socket but the websocket offers some interesting characteristics, such as exposing the weechat websocket over a https site, so you don't have to negotiate firewall restrictions.  Also reverse proxying a HTTP(S) endpoint is a lot well understood
[21:22:33] <Bayes> any acronym generator tool out there?
[21:22:33] <winny> than reverse proxying a raw tcp socket (it can be done, but I think i'd have to use stunnel, tcpwrappers, whatever, whereas HTTP(S) endpoint can be reverse proxied via nginx, HAProxy, caddy, so on)
[21:23:21] <johnjay> ah
[21:23:27] <CyberShadow> I'm tired of typing \_< and \_> when I want to match identifier boundaries.
[21:23:31] <CyberShadow> Is there a better way?

[21:23:52] <johnjay> well i dont know much networking but sounds good at least
[21:24:15] <winny> it's certainly a complexity tradeoff.  so maybe it's overkill for some usecases :D
[21:24:32] <euouae> CyberShadow, are we talking about html?
[21:24:41] <CyberShadow> No, regular expressions.
[21:24:59] <CyberShadow> winny: That's if I want to match an identifier and nothing else?
[21:25:06] <winny> interactively, yes
[21:25:11] <CyberShadow> I mean more in the context of regexp-replace
[21:25:19] <CyberShadow> and with more stuff than just the identifier
[21:25:33] <winny> oh, then you could do a isearch then promote to regex replace
[21:26:02] <johnjay> i guess i didnt get the part about negotiating firewall restrictions
[21:26:10] <winny> does emacs support \b?  maybe that could save you a few funny shift keys
[21:26:12] <CyberShadow> I never use \b in the way Emacs does. Maybe there's a way to make \b always mean the same thing as \_< ?
[21:26:15] <johnjay> how does weechat work there
[21:26:32] <CyberShadow> \b? That's new
[21:26:45] <grym> word .. boundary? 
[21:26:49] <grym> that's what it normally means
[21:26:57] <CyberShadow> It doesn't work
[21:27:12] <CyberShadow> Do you mean a literal question mark after "\b" ?
[21:27:14] <winny> it's like \_< or \_> in one
[21:27:46] <CyberShadow> If you mean \b without a question mark, then, that matches on the word boundary, and _ isn't a word character

[21:38:07] <zebrag> What is the point of mixing "common lisp" with emacs-lisp? 
[21:38:59] <technomancy> zebrag: early on it was because elisp just didn't have good functions for manipulating lists
[21:39:04] <AMPed> I know I'm being a little vague, but if there's any common mistakes people make that anyone can think of, some guidance would be appreciated. Thanks.
[21:39:16] <technomancy> now that seq.el exists and lexical scoping exists ... it's harder to see the point
