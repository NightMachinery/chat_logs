[00:43:15] <xx> is bullseye really releasing with an old version of firefox-esr?
[00:44:23] <greycat> Debian stable always uses the oldest *still supported* version of firefox-esr at any given moment.
[00:44:55] <greycat> There's a two-month overlap period when a new firefox-esr is released, where they support both the previous and the new versions.  Debian waits until that period expires before jumping to the new one.

[02:15:56] <bebop> debian has  a snap section and the only thing it basically says is use at your own risk
[02:17:03] <ratrace> bebop: if "debian" considers snapd harmful, it should be removed from packages.
[02:17:11] <bebop> "They update on their own schedule, and install files to nonstandard locations. It may not be wise to use a Snap without first understanding the reputation/limitations of Snap."
[02:17:37] <jelly> ratrace, debian ships pip and other third party packaging managers, too
[02:17:41] <ratrace> snaps are isolated squashfs namespaces. they don't install files anywhere.  snapd however, may install convenience shortcuts via /snaps/

[02:20:05] <ratrace> the whole point of snaps and flatpaks is the ability to install "alien" software without messing up the system. now, that says nothing about quality of snaps internally, or their security, or anything else.

[02:21:08] <ratrace> snaps _had_ (ie. no longer have) an issue with _startup_ times, not general runtime

[02:21:29] <Hash> Once snap is loaded into memory, it's as fast as your pc.
[02:21:43] <ratrace> absolutely yes. namespaces don't affect performance. startup times is affected because, again, they're squashfs loopback mounted filesystems primarily
[02:21:47] <ratrace> Hash: correct.

[02:22:11] <Hash> Initial load times are not much, but you have to consider, snap use their own everything,c ontained

[02:22:19] <ratrace> so, "duh" it takes time to unpack the squash, losetup and mount everything etc... but they fixed that with snapd runtimes
[02:22:24] <Hash> First your own desktop, then the various snaps
[02:22:36] <bebop> snap packages also tend to be slower to run, in part becasue they are actually compressed file system images that need to be mounted before they can be executed

[02:44:10] <ratrace> debian can't escape the endorsement. the very fact something is packaged in official repositories means the maintainers, and people who gave them upload rights, are endorsign the usage of said software.
[02:44:43] <ratrace> so i'm talking about endorsing snapd itself, which I believe is DFSG compliant.  can it be used to install non-dfsg software? yes. but so can bash, tar, and gcc.
[02:46:25] <ratrace> I also find it funny that firmware isos are "unofficial". and yet, they're dished out of very official debian.org namespace and infrastructure.

[17:36:23] <jhutchins> The database is on a CIFS share.  Everything worked fine in stretch, mutliple clients could access it.  
[17:36:45] <jhutchins> I built a new buster machine, and it says the database is corrupt and own't load it.
[17:37:14] <milkt> amacater: i'm not sure what are you taking about, i'm not talking about using "buster" or "stable", i'm wondering if i can replace "buster" with "10" or something similar
[17:38:16] <jhutchins> My stretch client is on the backport - 3.39.1+dfsg-3~bpo9.   The buster client is on 3.39.1+dfsg-3 - which looks like it shold be the same code.
[17:38:55] <jhutchins> The difference is in the python2 version on each of the systems.  I don't have the resources to track down where the eror is, and the devs won't talk to me.
[17:39:19] <amacater> mikt: NO - don't do that. When the point release changes to from 10.10 to 10.11, you'd have to change the links.
[17:39:57] <amacater> jhutchins: if you don't have the patience to help track down the error, the devs don't have any more time than you do to 
[17:40:13] <jhutchins> (If anybody hasn't caught it yet, I'm pretty frustrated with Debin devs saying offficial stable is "too old".)
[17:40:14] <amacater> help you sort it. 8-9 should be a feasible update
[17:40:54] <jhutchins> So I need a throw-away install where I can see if it's still broken in bullseye.

[17:42:34] <amacater> I think there's the point that it takes 2 years between releases and then a three year support or so: so by the time the code reaches EOL as stable, bits of it are 5 years old

[22:15:11] <sney> if you don't mind having aptitude in your image, it has a good package cloning method:
[22:15:13] <sney> !aptitude clone
[22:15:14] <dpkg> To clone a Debian machine using aptitude (or install your favourite packages) use aptitude search --disable-columns -F%p '~i!~M!~v' > package_list; on the reference machine; xargs aptitude --schedule-only install < package_list; aptitude install; on the other machine.  This preserves information about "automatically installed" packages that other methods do not.  See also <reinstall>, <things to backup>, <debian clone>, <apt-clone>.
[22:16:55] <ZeroBeholder> I am putting that in my notes for ornery packages after if preseeding wasn't 100% super awesome.
[22:17:30] <ZeroBeholder> The hostname seems like a value I should be able to dump and then push right back in...
[22:18:16] *** Joins: menace (~someone@user/menace)
[22:18:29] <ZeroBeholder> When I grep for domain, I only get "d-i netcfg/get_domain string unassigned-domain"
[22:19:16] <ZeroBeholder> "d-i netcfg/get_domain string example.com" was what I was hoping would do it, but no joy.
[22:21:43] <ZeroBeholder> Obviously it isn't example.com-- but, searching for the domain string didn't work. (Networking is mint though... happy that is everything I could hope it would be.)

[22:34:17] <PMT> Yes?
[22:34:20] <ZeroBeholder> I had changed it to "d-i netcfg/get_domain string example.com", no joy, still get asked the questions.
[22:34:31] <ZeroBeholder> *question
[22:36:33] <PMT> So your difficulty is that you're still being explicitly prompted?
[22:36:51] <ZeroBeholder> Still shaking in my boots with happiness at being able to zip through an install without messing around with a manual menu based install. So close. It is the domain prompt like normal.
[22:37:04] <PMT> The comment above netcfg/hostname seems to suggest it's what's to be used to set something regardless of what e.g. DHCP says.
[22:37:37] <ZeroBeholder> Yes, I even have an entry that says don't do automatic network stuff and also don't use DHCP.

[22:43:47] <PMT> Is the preseed config being loaded over the network?
[22:44:47] <ZeroBeholder> Preseed is referenced in the /boot/grub/grub.cfg and lives in /preseed/non-interactive.cfg-- which is mostly working.
[22:44:59] <ZeroBeholder> It is a bootable USB.
[22:45:29] <ZeroBeholder> Partitioned and formatted with the necessary files rsynced onto it.
[22:45:52] <ZeroBeholder> Not a dd if=debian.iso of=sdb situation.
