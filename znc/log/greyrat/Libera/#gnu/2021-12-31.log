[06:04:52] <tpefreedom> Ribby, for one, GNU doesn't develop the main linux kernel.
[06:05:19] <tpefreedom> The documentation for the kernel (linux) is separate.
[06:05:35] <Ribby> Really? Why?
[06:05:52] <tpefreedom> However, GNU does develop many important utilities/libraries.
[06:06:41] <tpefreedom> The kernel (linux) is a separate project. Linux-libre (a deblobbed version of the linux kernel) is largely developed by GNU.
[06:07:13] <Ribby> Okay, does that mean GNU is more advanced than just Linux?
[06:07:38] <Ribby> Or, even better, if I dare ask?

[06:10:04] <Ribby> I had an Ubuntu, and it looks like a Mac OS interface. It probably has some quirks that might be disagreeable to me. However, it boasts of a large generic driver base support.
[06:11:33] <tpefreedom> Ubuntu is not as free as other distros.
[06:12:14] <tpefreedom> *free in terms of freedom
[06:13:24] <Ribby> It's true. My machine doesn't support DVD boot installation for some reason (or my burning methods are too wrong) so I am stuck with buying a usb (great for safes though).
[06:13:28] <GNUHacker> linux is a program, GNU is an Operating System
[06:13:37] <Ribby> Seriously?
[06:13:58] <tpefreedom> specifically GNU+Linux
[06:14:03] <Ribby> Okay, I can count on GNU as a OS.
[06:14:06] <tpefreedom> (not to be confused with GNU Hurd)
[06:14:13] <GNUHacker> ubuntu is a GNU distribution, but ubuntu have non-free stuff
[06:14:36] <Ribby> Okay, that's what I'm talking about.
[06:14:53] <tpefreedom> Ribby, there are bits of nonfree firmware in the main linux kernel.
[06:15:13] <GNUHacker> GNU System anyways is called GNU/Linux or GNU+linux or GNU/BSD
[06:15:39] <tpefreedom> GNUHacker, There is also GNU Hurd.
[06:15:50] <Ribby> Like those driver softwares? I rather call it GNU OS, is that okay?

[07:47:48] <Ribby> so it's like copyright/patent and/or trademark.
[07:48:35] <Ribby> i am actually going to buy a usb device with a gnu os.
[07:49:23] <Ribby> I didn't want to go thru the clutter of all these Linux variants that try to compete with one another. I would just go to the most original or compatible.
[07:50:02] <Ribby> My greatest concern is that GNU may not have the generic driver to get at least the ethernet working. Wifi may work too.
[07:50:18] <Ribby> No need for specific company's driver software.
[07:50:39] <Ribby> The OS would have the necessary basics ready to go.
[07:51:08] <Ribby> I also have some linux interfacing questions and I thought GNU would know all of these intricacies?

[09:44:53] <Ribby> Oh, hello.
[09:45:26] <Ribby> It's not the irc, but rather the discs that works on former Windows OS that crashed.
[09:45:58] <Ribby> I tried reinstalling, but to no avail, it blue screened to a BSOD error.
[09:46:34] <Ribby> So, that machine, or should I say, this machine I'm using now, is run on a Ubuntu OS.

[09:53:46] <AIM[m]> Linux is Snappy
[09:53:54] <Ribby> The fatal crash occurred on a 32 bit Windows. The application to trigger was not a virus, but rather a Yubico 5 security application of some type. There was a requirement for a 64 bit Windows, but I believed the 32 or application would cease operation upon 32 bit detection. I wasn't really aware of specific versions being necessary. Regardless of the details, I thought I should provide a warning.

[09:59:40] <AIM[m]> That's self hosted I guess
[09:59:46] <labrador> Yeah thats probs managed by your server

[10:00:43] <AIM[m]> I'm thinking of keeping a server at home when I buy some PC or something...
[10:00:54] <AIM[m]> Probably not headless
[10:01:34] <labrador> Yeah its better to use federation when possible,otherwise matrix will just be "technically" federated. And actually centralized
[10:02:05] <labrador> Headless is fine,desktops use too much resources
[10:02:32] <Ribby> I just hate (I apologize if hate is too strong of a word) Windows for these situations. It is good and handy most of the time, but fatal flaws might cost another computer. Good thing I remembered Linux (I actually had Ubuntu 8, but bought a usb with 17 and 18 recently). I can see why enterprises prefer Linux variants.
[10:03:48] <labrador> Everybody here hates windows. You are #gnu after all. Just with more reasons.
[10:04:26] <Ribby> I know of a online supplier that might help with low budget computers. You can do a double check for verification, but it worked for me. I'm sorry if I can't prove more otherwise. I did have to provide some information so there's a bit of online risk (remember to use fraud alert).
[10:04:37] <Ribby> https://pcsrefurbished.com/sales/salesHome.aspx
[10:05:18] <Ribby> These guys require information before purchases are made.
[10:05:36] <labrador> I think a lot of places do.

[10:05:57] <AIM[m]> The monopoly of Microsoft is just effin toxic
[10:06:21] <AIM[m]> Kids usually learn windows at childhood? Like why?
[10:06:27] <labrador> There are no alternatives for a lot of people. Like if somebody is a graphics designer for instance.
[10:06:42] <labrador> Its a sad state society has put itself in
[10:06:53] <AIM[m]> For videos, I think Blender does most stuff
[10:07:02] <labrador> Yea but photoshop
[10:07:03] <AIM[m]> For Vectors Inkscape does well
[10:07:08] <AIM[m]> Krita is also good
[10:07:23] <tpefreedom> labrador, inkscape
[10:07:29] <labrador> Yeah all these are very well compared to their alternatives
[10:07:32] <AIM[m]> labrador: That's because people don't know much about alternatives
[10:07:39] <tpefreedom> AIM[m], or kdenlive, or shotcut
[10:07:45] <AIM[m]> It's the same as people using Windows
[10:07:48] <labrador> I was talking about areas like GIMP,DAWs and CAD
[10:07:54] <Ribby> Actually, the supplier uses Windows 7/10, but no backup CDs. That's why I thought maybe GNU/Linux can pitch in once the supplier's OS fails?
[10:07:57] <labrador> Free software is weak in these
[10:08:22] <AIM[m]> tpefreedom: I used Kdenlive but for advanced editing involving 3D or high level VFX , Blender is good
[10:08:25] <Ribby> Maybe, I should write in an email...
[10:08:43] <AIM[m]> For DAWS, I use LMMS....
[10:08:51] <AIM[m]> There are others as well

[10:29:06] <AIM[m]> It also allows booting from old config
[10:30:24] <labrador> Yeah that is possible because it keeps everything in /gnu/store. Also sandboxes applications so that they can only see what they need to. Makes it easier to have clean environments too.
[10:32:50] <AIM[m]> Yep
