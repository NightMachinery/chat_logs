[00:10:41] <Jaelae> anyone use restapi from like a GUI perspective for users to kick off jobs?
[00:11:07] <CableNinja> why not setup something like jenkins?
[00:11:09] <Jaelae> trying to see what some good ideas are like to put together syntax with parameters people can enter and they don't need postman
[00:11:29] <Jaelae> we use it for software devs but wasn't thinking about it for infrastructure
[00:11:37] <Jaelae> Ansible might work
[00:11:40] <CableNinja> create a freeform process and make the inputs take in a form
[00:11:47] <CableNinja> user fills out form
[00:11:49] <Jaelae> hmm
[00:11:52] <CableNinja> bam restapi execute
[00:12:17] <Jaelae> that might work. see previously i used vRealize Automation which really you don't need to use it on vmware products you can use it on anything
[00:12:29] <Jaelae> and i leveraged it to build a set of VMs, then add it to a BigIP load balancer. etc.
[00:14:50] <oxipital> we always talked about implementing jenkins for unit testing at a place i worked
[00:15:01] <oxipital> could never orchestrate the dev and ops requirements
[00:15:20] <CableNinja> it can be a big task
[00:15:27] <CableNinja> takes a lot of effort
[00:15:34] <oxipital> yeah
[00:15:39] <oxipital> we were me and two devs
[00:15:47] <oxipital> so that on top of normal tasks
[00:15:50] <CableNinja> my last job I had automated 80% of our processes to completely hands free, on my own, in the course of 1.5 years
[00:16:01] <oxipital> and apparently a delta booster is in the works.
[00:16:12] <oxipital> that's awesome
[00:16:19] <CableNinja> and started with literally nothing but a shitty PlasticSCM repo and devs with a fuzzy idea of a build process
[00:16:34] <oxipital> i really wish shit would move more towards that
[00:17:43] <CableNinja> it takes a lot of work, and a lot of time telling people to fuck off
[00:17:52] <CableNinja> and forcing people into a new working habit
[00:18:03] <CableNinja> EX: STOP BUILDING ON YOUR FUCKING MACHINE, LET THE BUILDSERVER DO IT
[00:19:10] <Jaelae> we have uhh
[00:19:13] <Jaelae> over 50,000 VMs
[00:19:21] <Jaelae> and only some things are automated. need to step it up more
[00:19:27] * oxipital is listening to Department of Labor official Word
[00:20:19] <oxipital> they're tripping
[00:20:20] <oxipital> heh
[00:20:21] <CableNinja> Jaelae I automated an entire ESXi install, including pre-defined VM image downloads from the internet and registration to the host, totally hands free. plug in a usb stick, come back in 8 hours
[00:20:34] <CableNinja> I think that was my best project ever
[00:20:35] <oxipital> CableNinja: that's what we were looking to do
[00:20:42] <oxipital> everything from pulling from git
[00:20:46] <CableNinja> oh nooooo
[00:20:48] <CableNinja> noooo
[00:20:51] <sd> 13<S​hocklance> no
[00:20:51] <oxipital> to ansible/chef for vm setup
[00:20:55] <CableNinja> this was pre-built VMs releasing to a customer
[00:21:01] <Jaelae> CableNinja: i am using VCF right now
[00:21:06] <oxipital> this was purely for testing 
[00:21:10] <CableNinja> we'd build the images through proper IaC stuff, put the VM up on S3
[00:21:12] <Jaelae> so i can kick off the install and it installs vCenter, LogInsight, NSX, Vsan
[00:21:14] <Jaelae> all in one shot
[00:21:21] <Jaelae> all new deployments are running that
[00:21:30] <CableNinja> our api had registry of the VM images, and the ESX host queried the API for new images
[00:21:38] <CableNinja> host downloads and register
[00:21:40] <Jaelae> we get esxi reinstalled from our var though
[00:21:50] <CableNinja> all automatically, in the esxi hypervisor land
[00:22:01] <sd> 13<S​hocklance> that's pretty cool. I wish my job was large enough to need that level of automation
[00:22:30] <Jaelae> a new cluster for us is 20-30 esxi hosts
[00:22:31] <Jaelae> so its annoying
[00:22:36] <CableNinja> was a small company, but the problem was we were deploying these esx hosts to customer sites and didnt have to have a manual the size of War and Peace to deploy it
[00:22:49] <oxipital> yeah
[00:23:02] <Jaelae> yea
[00:23:05] <oxipital> i got involved in the customer facing documentation
[00:23:16] <CableNinja> our deployment team would literally walk in and as first part of the rack being stood up after cabling the USB stick was plugged in
[00:23:17] <Jaelae> i mean my last job we were a medical software company. had about 8 server racks
[00:23:18] <oxipital> it seems like a fun alternative to straight tech
[00:23:20] <Jaelae> but we figured if we automate 
[00:23:24] <Jaelae> we would make things easier
[00:23:24] <sd> 13<S​hocklance> there ya go. that actually makes sense

[03:14:08] <iphone> literally the only requirement

[03:14:49] <e1> CMD script.sh

[06:12:21] <xe0n> We announced the next Windows LTSC would be built on Windows 10, version 21H2, and yes it will be a 5 year support lifecycle. We can expect that the next LTSC *after* Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 will be built on Windows 11. And it will also keep the 5 year support. However, that's expected in 3 years or so, so anything can happen in that timeframe. If you need to use LTSC for a 
[06:12:21] <xe0n> longer period, we recommend moving to Windows 10 IoT LTSC.

[08:51:32] <sd> 07<x​oxo> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_vs._MikeRoweSoft
[08:51:42] <JollyRgrs> skype4biz was not the same as skype consumer, but it was basically OCS + skype consumer mixed in a pot together... but either way... they paid money for skype... we were talking about if that was an investment they got positive ROI

[08:52:27] <JollyRgrs> i could be wrong

[08:52:38] <sd> 07<x​oxo> lync was rebranded to skype for business
[08:52:41] <xe0n> 2015 was when skype branding came over lync
[08:52:45] <JollyRgrs> so again... they used the IP they had from skype and the code and put it into lync

[08:52:54] <xe0n> windows store
[08:52:55] <xe0n> new one
[08:53:00] <JollyRgrs> then they just pushed the reg changes to change the name from lync to skype. still to this day, the .exe for SfB is lync.exe

[08:55:59] <JollyRgrs> if having skype means that MSFT keeps customers in-house for their comms vs going with another company, that's hard to measure

[11:18:01] <Mark_Pinecone13> What was "and" argument in bash? Idea is to grep only errors form Jul-2021 (Jul-2021 and error or waning or fail)      grep -iR 'error\|warning\|fail'

[11:21:49] <JollyRgrs> Mark_Pinecone13: come again? are you sure you want to "and"? it sounds like you want to pipe
[11:22:08] <JollyRgrs> you want to grep all from jul-2021 and then inside of that data, you want to grep for error/warning/fail?
[11:22:39] <JollyRgrs> either order isn't a big deal (unless depending on your data, one query is significantly longer to process than the other)
[11:23:05] <Mark_Pinecone13> somehow grep -iR 'error\|fail\|warn' | grep Jul-2021 doesnt output anything
[11:23:23] <JollyRgrs> iirc, you have to tell grep to output in ascii or text form or something
[11:23:26] <JollyRgrs> i've had issues with that in the past, too
[11:24:28] <JollyRgrs> i think it depends on your input though

[12:41:34] <CableNinja> :( saaaaad panda
[12:41:39] <Oliber> I was somewhat assuming that the multi subnet config was to try to make sure that LACP chose different physical paths for the two streams, but shouldn't be required
