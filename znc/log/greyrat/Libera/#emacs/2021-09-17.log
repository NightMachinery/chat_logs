[03:08:14] <laurus> I'm having trouble removing attachments from messages with the latest version of mu4e. The way I did it before was by adding a function to the plist variable mu4e-view-attachment-actions. But when I try to remove the attachment, my function is not showing up as an option as it used to.

[03:08:29] <Common-Lisp> mu4e has been completely broken for me since the last update
[03:08:32] <Common-Lisp> won't even load anymore
[03:08:40] <laurus> Common-Lisp: perhaps I can help you get it working
[03:08:50] <Common-Lisp> That would be nice 
[03:09:00] <laurus> Common-Lisp: What is the issue when you try to load it?
[03:09:27] <Common-Lisp> It prints a message like "Indexing, this will take awhile" several times a second, forever.
[03:09:49] <laurus> Common-Lisp: Oh, is that when you are running "mu index" on the command line?
[03:10:08] <parsnip> what if you nuke the index directory?
[03:10:17] <Common-Lisp> No that's when I run M-x mu4e
[03:10:20] <Common-Lisp> Specifically it prints:
[03:10:21] <Common-Lisp> [mu4e] Indexing... processed 0, updated 0
[03:10:22] <Common-Lisp> [mu4e] Indexing completed; processed 0, updated 0, cleaned-up 0
[03:10:22] <Common-Lisp>  
[03:10:29] <Common-Lisp> Endlessly
[03:10:43] <parsnip> try nuking the index directory, and call mu index from command line, something like that
[03:10:46] <laurus> Common-Lisp: So, starting I think with version 1.4 or so, you need to run "mu init" on the command line followed by "mu index"
[03:11:13] <laurus> Common-Lisp: The mu init you always had to run even in past versions, but now you specify your e-mail address on the command line rather than in an .el file
[03:11:25] <Common-Lisp> oh, I see 
[03:11:32] <laurus> Common-Lisp: so its something like:
[03:11:33] <laurus> mu init --maildir=/path/to/maildir --my-address=me@example.com
[03:11:41] <laurus> Common-Lisp: Then, like parsnip said, you will run:
[03:11:42] <laurus> mu index
[03:11:52] <laurus> Which does all the indexing. Only _then_, do you open mu4e in Emacs.
[03:12:14] <Common-Lisp> will I have to do this every login?
[03:12:23] <parsnip> yeah i'm handwaving the part where you review the README
[03:12:27] <laurus> Common-Lisp: No, just before the first time you run mu4e.
[03:12:46] <parsnip> nuke the index, start from README ;)
[03:13:00] <laurus> parsnip: are you familiar at all with how attachments are treated in mu4e?
[03:13:17] <laurus> parsnip: I used to use the function here: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/23812/remove-attachments-from-emails
[03:13:21] <laurus> But it does not work anymore.

[03:30:47] <benaiah> i.e., C-x b some-buffer.js RET would open a new buffer in js-mode
[03:32:21] <technomancy> I think the piece that's missing for that to work completely automatically is that there doesn't appear to be a new-buffer-hook, so you would have to use defadvice. but a function that would activate the right mode based on the buffer name instead of a filename is easy; you just walk thru auto-mode-alist.

[03:55:12] <twb> bremner: there's two krb options.  Either you run samba-ad and pretend to be Windows, or you use MIT krb which never ever works.

However, after is saved, I want to keep working and probably save more output but to another file... However since I already saved to the file the buffer s not linked to it

[04:26:36] <fsbot> write-file is an interactive compiled Lisp function in ‘files.el’.
[04:26:36] <fsbot> It is bound to C-x C-w, <menu-bar> <file> <write-file>.
[04:26:36] <fsbot> (write-file FILENAME &optional CONFIRM)
[04:26:36] <fsbot> Write current buffer into file FILENAME. ;;[ ,more / ,dump]
[04:26:40] <minall> Oh, that would be what I need, thank you parsnip !
[04:26:43] <parsnip> ,more
[04:26:43] <fsbot> This makes the buffer visit that file, and marks it as not modified.
[04:26:43] <fsbot> If you specify just a directory name as FILENAME, that means to use
[04:26:43] <fsbot> the default file name but in that directory.  You can also yank
[04:26:43] <fsbot> the default file name into the minibuffer to edit it, using M-n. ;;[ ,more / ,dump]
[04:26:46] <parsnip> :)
[04:26:51] <parsnip> ,more
[04:26:51] <fsbot> If the buffer is not already visiting a file, the default file name
[04:26:51] <fsbot> for the output file is the buffer name.
[04:26:51] <fsbot> If optional second arg CONFIRM is non-nil, this function
[04:26:51] <fsbot> asks for confirmation before overwriting an existing file.
[04:26:51] <fsbot> Interactively, confirmation is required unless you supply a prefix argument.

[05:12:45] <parsnip> laurus: why don't you start with your real question? that you want to delete attachments?

[05:15:48] <parsnip> i'm guessing the attachment is a MIME thing, not sure

[05:18:38] <grym> ,emacs-related keeping up with the latest unicode standard 
[05:18:38] <fsbot> It may not be that obvious for the layman, but keeping up with the latest unicode standard is indeed emacs-related, grym.
[05:18:46] <laurus> The gnus view also displayed a bunch of information about the messages that I didn't need. It also "hid" various attachments, and didn't provide a simple way to see the list of them like the old view did.
[05:19:03] <laurus> parsnip: for example the gnus view converts :) to a yellow smiley face
[05:19:18] <grym> i have a :bug: tag in org
[05:19:19] <laurus> But as you  can see my main complaints are about the treatment of attachments, the gnus message view seems highly complicated
[05:19:21] <perrierjouet> is gnus > elfeed + mu4e ?
[05:19:27] <grym> and, uh.  that's amusingly rendered sometimes

[08:13:09] <parsnip> > That states go to war to seize natural resources, especially oil, seems like a truism. However, Emily Meierding of the Naval Postgraduate School argues that such wars for oil are in reality exceptionally rare. In this post, based on her new book, she explains that the costs and risks of such conflicts are almost always too high for would-be aggressors to pay.

[22:23:06] <talismanick> I just learned that lagers didn't exist until the 1600s or so because the closest relative to the bottom-fermenting yeasts they use was found on a tree in South America

[23:43:57] * fsbot serves Bayes a frosty mug of Skol!
[23:44:33] <rpav> niemand: probably have a separate `(defvar my-normal-config ...)` and make the other one dependent on that
[23:44:42] <rpav> then use it specifically when you need it, but even then i dnno
[23:44:54] *** Joins: tlaxkit (~hexchat@170.253.35.150)
[23:46:15] <niemand> it's just that with a seperate variable, i'm guessing that at some time in the future, i will have forgotten it and will be really frustrated, since it isn't working as intended
[23:46:40] <niemand> but i guess there is no better solution 
[23:47:17] <rpav> not if one defines the dynamically-referenced `real-config` based on it
