[16:18:51] <madprops> so apparnetly z.sh uses some awk
[16:19:04] <madprops> https://github.com/rupa/z/blob/master/z.sh
[16:21:45] <earnestly> Sigh
[16:22:11] <earnestly> At first I thought it was posix, then see arrays
[16:23:12] <earnestly> And if they're going to use gawk features, might as well go all in, since their use of date isn't portable either
[16:25:39] <Patsie> arrays in awk are posix, just not multidimensional arrays, that's a gawk special
[16:26:24] <earnestly> Patsie: The arrays are in the shell script.  Their use of gawk is via imatch
[16:28:40] <Patsie> I dunno, I did not have a look at the script itself
[16:28:53] <Patsie> just reacting to your statement

[19:13:53] <gnomon> earnestly, the '.sh' extension is not particularly meaningful anyways.  I would not attribute the file name any significance.  Shebang or bust.
[19:14:38] <gnomon> ...huh, that file doesn't even have a shebang..?
[19:15:48] <earnestly> .sh is an unfortunate result of cargo-cult and google recommending it for shell scripts even if it's not sh.  The lack of a shebang is fine as it will be added when installed avoiding all the nonsense of env and bypassing the problem of location
[19:17:35] <gnomon> I think this script comes from a developer community sufficiently different in terms of values and practices from the ones in which I participate that I can't even reasonably tease out the parts that are good practice from those with which I disagree.
[19:17:45] <gnomon> this_is_fine_dog.jpeg
[19:18:35] <Patsie> :)
[19:23:00] <earnestly> # awk 'BEGIN {print split("foo/bar/baz", hmm, "/")}'
[19:23:02] <shbot> earnestly: 3
[19:23:06] <earnestly> That's kind
[19:24:54] <earnestly> It's always nice when functions can return something useful instead of throwing away information it went to the trouble of calculating
[19:25:03] <earnestly> incidental information*

[19:40:58] <Patsie> yeah, I use the split() return value quite frequently
[19:42:43] <Patsie>     if (split(col, arr, ";") == 3)
[19:42:49] <Patsie>   nTextures = split("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ", mTextures, "")
[19:42:53] <Patsie> stuff like that
[19:44:13] <Patsie> last one might look silly, with a static string, but I think it's convenient if that string ever changes in the future
[19:44:30] <earnestly> Yeah, avoids having to recalculate the length while also letting you do stuff like that without having to store a variable
[19:45:09] <earnestly> Patsie: For YAGNI style code I tend to leave the code I used to generate the static value as a comment and then provide the static result below
[19:45:33] <earnestly> Course it doesn't matter if the code isn't really causing a problem
