[13:05:31] <berkhan> hi channel! not sure where to ask this question but here it goes. i am in search of e-mail archive software that I can install either on Linux or Windows. We don't have any regulatory reasons but more for keeping e-mails in one place so that can be searched.

[13:49:06] <taman> berkhan: 'apt-cache search archive | grep mail' will show some choices, if you're using a deb-based distribution.

[14:07:17] <Khepra> berkhan: well, IMAP is kinda designed for that. you can have a central IMAP storage server and replicate to it from your production IMAP servers, I think you can do many-to-one with dovecot, but I'm not sure.
[14:07:48] <Khepra> atop of taht you can install any email client or viewer that supports IMAP. Web based, or osx, android, pc, ...
[14:09:00] <Khepra> bottom line, an "email" ist just a text file with some syntactic requirements. So the only question is, what kind of UI you need atop of all that.
