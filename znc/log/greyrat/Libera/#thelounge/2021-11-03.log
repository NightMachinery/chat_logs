[05:48:11] <johncs> Oh yeah! Should've pinged you. You can run off master now.
[05:48:27] <johncs> Relatedly, happen to notice any bugs while you've been using it?
[05:48:38] <brettgilio> none

[05:50:07] <johncs> but the current idea is that this is temporary. SortableJS isn't the most active project, but it definitely doesn't look dead

[05:57:14] <brettgilio> yep, seems so MaxLeiter
[05:58:28] <brettgilio> is there a known thelounge plugin that will auto-pastebin multiple lines of text?
[06:03:25] <johncs> There's some convenient paste bins that you can dump data to with netcat. I have a little utility script that dumps to one. utility script: https://l.termbin.com/nsgc
[06:03:45] <johncs> (some meta fun, just made that by doing `cat "$(command -v pb)" | pb` üòÖ)
[06:06:59] <johncs> Ah that script uses another one of my scripts (cb), lawl. They're all in this repo https://github.com/itsjohncs/dotfiles. cb is at https://github.com/itsjohncs/dotfiles/blob/main/src/scripts/cb. But fiche (which termbin is an instance of) has some info and bash aliases on their GitHub as well: https://github.com/solusipse/fiche
[06:09:29] <MaxLeiter> brettgilio: no, but i think xPaw has a GH branch that mostly implemented it

[12:11:45] <johncs> It's only appearing on the new iOS 15
[12:11:57] <johncs> so presumably a change in how the browser is interpreting some of the styling
[12:12:12] <johncs> Should be pretty easy to fix... actually might just do that right now. I suspect it's one missing line of css
[12:13:06] <Activ8> it will just be the same as before

[12:24:20] <Activ8> there's also another issue I think that I need to test with https://bpa.st/QHMA

[12:26:29] <johncs> Oh interesting. The user list is floating when the screen is small. So that might the right ordering
[12:26:48] <johncs> The user list should really dismiss itself when you click elsewhere and grey the screen, just like the sidebar does
[12:27:29] <johncs> The thing I'm worried about is the address bar is suddenly very excited to become small
[12:28:14] <johncs> The lounge isn't adjusting to the new screen space...
[12:28:59] <johncs> Oh hey, but the the web product that I sell as my day job _does_. Excellent. I can just steal what I did for that üòÜ. I remember it being tricky to figure out.
[12:33:15] <janis> dont have an iphone, but firefox on android (and probably ios) has the same problem
[12:33:52] <janis> when address bar get swiped away tl doesnt adjust to new screen space
[12:35:08] <janis> dont know how hacky my solution is, but i fixed it by adding html{position:fixed;width:100%} to css

[12:40:31] <johncs> Not usually, this isn't a very usual bit though. I believe there may be some more units coming to the spec to help the situation, but if I recall they seemed a bit lacking
[12:41:17] <johncs> I couldn't find a reliable CSS only solution myself. I don't know that it doesn't exist, but I did try.
[12:41:22] <johncs> This is what I came up with: https://termbin.com/gyipe
[12:41:32] <bookworm> hiding and unhiding the url bar? How's that unusual?
[12:41:33] <johncs> Plugged into the pages resize event
[12:42:30] <johncs> Haha I meant that this is just a particularly challenging problem. You wouldn't usually need JS.
[12:43:02] <johncs> If you know of another way, I'm very interested in it.
[12:43:28] <johncs> The position fixed is honestly a clever idea. Though I agree it feels hacky and I'm worried about browser compat
[12:44:05] <bookworm> I have an immediate allergic reaction to window.scroolTo(0,0} if that thing does what it says on the tin you'd be messing up the scroll position on the page no?
[12:44:35] <johncs> My app is also a full page app
[12:44:39] <johncs> Scrolling is not a thing that happens
[12:44:51] <johncs> The lounge is the same way, so it's probably appropriate
[12:45:14] <bookworm> then why the call?
[12:45:21] <johncs> ah, excellent question
[12:45:40] <johncs> Well this is all about the page shifting its size to and fro
[12:46:19] <johncs> I forget which OSes were affected, but it was possible to get into the state where the page is exactly the size of the viewport (correctly) but the page is scrolled because the browser doesn't know it doesn't need a scrollbar yet
[12:47:01] <johncs> I think it was because the address bar on the top would shrink but it'd try to keep everything in the same place on the screen
[12:47:54] <bookworm> it just seems way to hacky for my taste, no offense
[12:48:07] <bookworm> but that's the job of the browser in theory
[12:48:17] *** Joins: j0rd (~j0rd@sff.ninja)

[13:26:19] <bookworm> what do you consider a TL header exactly? And why would you try to drag from it? Are you referring to the bar with the channel name and topic?
[13:26:32] <bookworm> that thing can't move does it?
[13:26:33] <janis> yes
[13:27:11] <janis> it cant move, but trying to move it could potentially trigger adress bar hiding
[13:29:56] <janis> at least in mobile firefox on android it works reliably that way - you either have to scroll unscrollable element or reach end of message list to trigger address bar disappearing.
[13:32:06] <janis> but as for compatibility of position:fixed "fix" - does anyone actually see any specific issues it could create?

[14:16:50] <janis> according to your current commit?
[14:16:52] <bookworm> as in, \* will escape the * to a literal one. Even if you meant \${anyCharAfterThis}

[14:39:10] <Activ8> it's hard to follow when you don't have a clue. you assume everyone can follow this shit
[14:39:14] <Activ8> i'm learning
[14:39:51] <bookworm> it uses npm to fetch whatever version is in debian/control

[14:44:24] <bookworm> does some version manipulation too, you don't really need any new tag. npm can work with github directly
[14:44:59] <Activ8> so to pull it from master it would need a master tag.  I tried master but doesn't find it, obv cos it's not there, just tested.
[14:45:41] <Activ8> I tried changing the control file Version: master, doesn't find it not sure why
[14:45:59] <bookworm> you'd need to change the script slightly

[22:01:46] <johncs> Seems fine to me MaxLeiter. Not sure what problems that might cause.
[22:06:37] <johncs> bookworm: I think the spec implies \\ would let you use a back slash. That‚Äôs usually how escaping via backslashes work.
[22:07:08] <johncs> but yeah, I agree it‚Äôs really not necessary to implement the escaping. I wonder if other clients bothered to

[22:08:01] <johncs> oh totally
[22:09:03] <johncs> It‚Äôs just how back slash escaping systems work. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôve seen an escaping system that used back slash that didn‚Äôt have a double backslash to escape the backslash.

[22:09:30] <johncs> since it doesn‚Äôt go into details about what ‚Äúescaping via backslash means‚Äù it‚Äôs relying on these conventions anyways
[22:09:31] <bookworm> sure, but then it has to be in the docs
[22:09:56] <bookworm> after all they give a ABF or whatever those things are called, spec like
[22:10:10] <bookworm> and the only relevant thing is >These two characters can be escaped using the ('\', 0x5C) character.
