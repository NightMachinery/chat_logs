[06:10:33] <rdrg109> pjb: Thanks again for the help. The [Q] thing is a convention that I follow so that people who are willing to help can answer my question and those who aren't can just skip them.
[06:11:58] <rdrg109> Is it bothersome? If that's the case, I can make an exception on this channel.

[19:30:15] <skempf> Funny. I rarely search through logs for my questions, but rather for the good answers I remember.
[19:32:09] <lucerne> skempf: I generally copy both questions and answers when they are good (to my notes)

[19:46:29] <pjb> A good exercise would be to write an AI that would identify the questions and the answers, and build a knowledge database from them. It could then reply for repeated or simialr questionsâ€¦

[19:53:03] <thrig> does talking about this bother you?
