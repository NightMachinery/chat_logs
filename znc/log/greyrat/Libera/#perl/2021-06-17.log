[00:45:52] <yanmaani> how do I get it to replace $str on each use?
[00:45:54] <LeoNerd> Use the . concat operator
[00:45:57] <LeoNerd> Or sprintf %s
[00:45:57] <zgu> the @{[]} trick maybe?
[00:46:01] <LeoNerd> Or shoppingcart

[00:46:09] <yanmaani> I want it at runtime
[00:46:13] <LeoNerd> It's a constant
[00:46:24] <LeoNerd> You want it const-folded at compiletime. Then it's constant
[00:46:26] <yanmaani> e.g. define the constant at the top, then define $str, then have it interpolate $str on each invocation
[00:46:31] <yanmaani> hmm, but I don't want that
[00:46:40] <LeoNerd> Then,... don't make it constant
[00:46:49] <yanmaani> fair enough
[00:46:54] <LeoNerd> The entire point of constants is that they are constant, and therefore subject to const-folding
[00:47:02] <LeoNerd> If you didn't want const-folding then just don't make it constant.
[00:47:05] <zgu> yeah that wouldn't be a constant

[01:12:23] <yanmaani> Is it possible to pack (not unpack) a binary string to hex?
[01:13:17] <Grinnz> sweval: sprintf '%v02X', "\1\2\3"
[01:13:19] <perlbot> Grinnz: 01.02.03
[01:13:37] <LeoNerd> "pack a binary string to hex" -- I don't even follow the question
[01:13:44] <Grinnz> well, if you don't want the . you can do it with pack yes
[01:13:55] <yanmaani> unpack can take a binary string and convert it to hex, right
[01:13:59] <Grinnz> sweval: unpack 'H*', "\1\2\3"
[01:14:00] <yanmaani> can pack do the same operation?
[01:14:01] <perlbot> Grinnz: 010203
[01:14:08] <Grinnz> no, pack does the opposite operation
[01:14:10] <Grinnz> hence the name
[01:14:12] <LeoNerd> Oh, the H formats are -weeeeird-
[01:14:19] <LeoNerd> I consider them totally separate functions
[01:15:05] <Grinnz> it's difficult to remember which is which, but the rule of thumb is: pack turns random stuff into a byte string, unpack turns a byte string into random stuff
[01:15:11] <Grinnz> random stuff in this case is your hex string
[01:15:22] <LeoNerd> Well,.. sortof. Except the H ones work backwards to that :/
[01:15:26] <Grinnz> no they don't
[01:15:32] <LeoNerd> Which is why I suggest not thinking of H as being pack-related
[01:15:48] <Grinnz> they just feel like they work backwards, if you consider the hex string being what you're packing into, which is what it feels like
[01:15:54] <Grinnz> but you're actually unpacking a byte string to a hex string
[01:17:23] <Grinnz> pack creates a bytestring, unpack takes a bytestring - hex strings are not bytestrings in this api

[02:28:10] <LeoNerd> If I wasn't this very moment writing a Perl RFC about `defer {}`, I'd almost consider writing a Perl RFC about it
[02:28:33] <tm604> with unpack and regex we ended up using binary concepts that are more suited to moisture vaporators
[02:29:39] <tm604> but implementing a 3-way "success, fail, incomplete" would probably be more suited to CPAN at this point, I don't see a good way of adjusting syntax to cram that in tehre

[03:24:04] <pflanze> Overload question: I'm using `use overload '""' => 'string', fallback => 1;`. Perlcritic tells me I should overload bool, because otherwise bool could be unexpected. But I would assume that bool would use the string overload, which is fine with me.
[03:24:05] *** Joins: Judabuda (~ok@user/judabuda)
[03:24:22] <pflanze> Am I not seeing the problem?
[03:24:34] <Grinnz> that means that if the string overload returns '' or 0, your object will be false, even though it's a ref
[03:24:40] <Grinnz> this is usually unwanted
[03:25:01] <Grinnz> unless it's something like: a Math::BigInt, which literally represents the number 0
[03:25:14] <Grinnz> thats the only case where you'd want a bool overload that can be falsey
[03:25:15] <pflanze> I always check with `defined` for the existence of a value.
[03:25:57] <Grinnz> yes, but there may be other situations where the blessed ref being falsey may be surprising

[03:27:27] <Grinnz> i would use the criteria: would users expect to use the blessed ref to just be a special number or string (a la Math::BigInt or Mojo::ByteStream) - in those cases, the falsy string making the ref falsy makes sense
[03:27:34] <Grinnz> because there is nothing else to the object
[03:28:17] <Grinnz> those type of objects are rare, hence the policy erring on the side of "always bool => sub {1}"
[03:29:15] *** Joins: aquanight (~aquanight@174-126-159-166.cpe.sparklight.net)
[03:30:26] <pflanze> I've got two cases: one is the base class for error values (think exception hierarchy, but I'm using them as values in Rust manner, too), the other is transparent lazy eval (promise). In the error value case, nobody should use it in boolean context, and if they do and the error string *is* "" or "0", then that may be the right value for bool too.
[03:30:40] <Grinnz> exceptions *must* always be truthy
[03:30:42] <pflanze> In transparent lazy, I just want the user to see the forced value.
[03:30:47] <Grinnz> that's the biggest case where this has caused problems, actually
[03:31:06] <pflanze> if ($@), I see.
[03:31:10] <Grinnz> right
[03:31:17] <Grinnz> if ($@) is a terrible test, but it's widely done
[03:31:23] <pflanze> Yes, agreed.
[03:31:37] <Grinnz> and you can't use defined for that, because $@ is empty string on success, not undef
[03:32:02] <pflanze> I actually always do if (eval { $res = expr; 1 }) { .. } else { ... }
[03:32:08] <pflanze> But I know many people don't.

[03:33:03] *** whynot_ is now known as whynot
[03:33:17] <Grinnz> it's hard to describe the distinction but it really is only in the case where the object represents a string, and nothing else (like that it's an exception, or filepath, or whatever)
[03:33:28] <Grinnz> where you should allow it to be falsy
[03:33:55] <pflanze> transparent promises should represent whatever the lazy expression returns, thus also false.
[03:34:05] <pflanze> I'll have to test this case.
[03:34:14] <Grinnz> maybe
[03:34:49] <LeoNerd> Small naming suggestion: Don't call them "promises", because that will confuse everyone
[03:35:49] <pflanze> Maybe. Any suggestion?
[03:35:50] <Grinnz> it sounds almost like something you might want to use fetch magic for instead of overloads - who's to say the expression results in something you want to stringify?

[03:36:28] *** Joins: wesm (~wes@firewall.mitsi.com)
[03:36:41] <Grinnz> the only downside of fetch magic is it won't copy - assigning to a new variable will just call the fetch
[03:37:16] <pflanze> Ah, that won't fly then.
[03:38:08] <Grinnz> overloads just seem like an odd time to do the resolving
[03:38:21] <Grinnz> but not sure what solution would be better for your case
[03:38:31] <pflanze> As far as I've tested it works fine.
[03:38:56] <LeoNerd> overloads won't work for   ref $var  or  defined $var
[03:39:01] <LeoNerd> or  blessed $var
[03:39:07] <LeoNerd> or come to think of it,  $var isa Class
[03:39:19] <Grinnz> yeah, or calling methods on it
[03:39:26] <Grinnz> if say it resolves to an object
[03:39:31] <pflanze> I use AUTOLOAD for method calls
[03:39:55] <LeoNerd> Have you considered just /not/ making it transparent?
[03:40:10] <LeoNerd> Ie.. if you use a real Future,  then you can  $f->get->method(@args)  on it
[03:40:13] <pflanze> LeoNerd, I have both, FP::Lazy (non-transparent) and FP::TransparentLazy
[03:40:45] <pflanze> Both do AUTOLOAD, though--that much transparence is warranted I think.

[05:41:35] <simcop2387> pragma-: it's still basically true, but tree-sitter parsers are some rather interesting tech and it *might* be possible to get one of them to understand prototypes and mutate itself properly
[05:41:54] <willthechill> a handful of us have tried our hand at writing our own static or semi-dynamic Perl grammars, with varying levels of success
[05:41:56] <simcop2387> that'd probably get you 99.9% of cpan or better
[05:42:12] <pragma-> indeed, i see you rperl has a flag to support "low, medium and high magicks" but it currently does nothing since only "low" is supported
[05:42:17] <willthechill> simcop2387: unfortunately, parsing alone doesn't really do anything useful
[05:42:39] <simcop2387> willthechill: yea but without the parser you can't do anything useful either :)
[05:43:12] <willthechill> pragma-: I've already got medium-magic data types working, and some hand-compiled examples
[05:43:21] <pragma-> progress
[05:43:49] <simcop2387> the other fun thing is that (it's still hard) you can do something like String::Tagged to your input and tag the parser state into it so that you can avoid having to reparse everything a lot of the time for something like a language server.  that can take a lot of memory though if you're not clever
[05:44:08] <willthechill> pragma-: but low-magic is mostly what I'm focused on because that's where we get our biggest speedup, and you can mix your compiled and interpreted code, so there is relatively low motivation for me personally to spend lots of time on medium-magic compiling
[05:44:43] <willthechill> simcop2387: I see your high-magic parsing as being used in something like a language server far sooner than something like a compiler
[05:44:53] <simcop2387> willthechill: definitely
[05:45:15] <willthechill> it's prohibitively difficult to compile our already-mostly-parsed low-magic subset of Perl; upgrading that to a high-magic subset of Perl doesn't exactly make the job easier LOL ;-)
[05:45:27] <willthechill> #babysteps

[05:46:03] <simcop2387> yea and sadly i'd consider prototypes to be at highest medium magic as far as a compiler is concerned.  things like local and globs are probably the worst of the worst for you
[05:47:54] <willthechill> pragma-: here's some hand-compiled medium-magic code with medium-magic code, specifically CPPOPS_PERLTYPES compile mode

[05:49:29] <willthechill> nope none are the same
[05:49:36] <simcop2387> yea i'm blind
[05:49:43] <simcop2387> they're very close though :)
[05:50:01] <willthechill> yes the URLs are close, the file suffixes differ based on compile modes
[05:50:32] <willthechill> PERLOPS_PERLTYPES is normal high-magic low-speed interpreted Perl; CPPOPS_PERLTYPES is medium-magic medium-speed; CPPOPS_CPPTYPES is low-magic high-speed
[05:51:12] <willthechill> I haven't even tried to bother with things like globs or tied vars etc
[05:51:42] <willthechill> if you need to tie your globs then put that code in a normal interpreted .pm file and put the rest of your compilable code into a different .pm file and only compile one of them
[05:51:45] <willthechill> voila
[05:52:18] <simcop2387> oh yea tied globs should just be the compiler ordering a hit out on you via ethereum deposits

[23:07:29] <yanmaani> Any way to clean out a script?
[23:07:40] <yanmaani> If you've imported some stuff, is there a simple way to get a list of import lines you can safely remove?
[23:08:44] <thrig> comment them out. if something blows up, that use was necessary
[23:08:49] <mst> yanmaani: you can find what imports you had and where by using p3rl.org/Devel::Wherefore
[23:10:57] <pragma-> those links would be easier to click if they had the procotol attached
[23:11:08] <pragma-> copying and pasting them from irc to my browser is so 90's
[23:11:42] <yanmaani> mst: but will this tell me which ones aren't used?
[23:11:43] <thrig> irc is what, late 80s code and browser what, early 90s code?
[23:11:52] <mst> yanmaani: no
[23:12:01] <mst> yanmaani: doing that is -really- hard
[23:12:20] <mst> I might be able to add a feature for it
[23:12:43] <yanmaani> mst: thrig's approach seems like it'd work, but requires a test suite.
[23:13:04] <thrig> or when you fiddle with the code also remember to maintain the use statements

[23:23:36] <Grinnz> or probably defined, since you don't want to be concatenating to undef anyway
[23:23:54] <Grinnz> oh, arrays
[23:23:59] <Grinnz> then nevermind, what they said :)
[23:24:44] <Grinnz> yanmaani: the easiest way to keep imports clean is to always explicitly import every function you use, then you can clean up with some ctrl+f
[23:24:51] <Grinnz> (or grep or whatever)
[23:25:28] <Grinnz> that only helps for importers, not modules that do other things. for classes, you can grep for the class name

[23:49:42] <tm604> Guest9: for an exercise like that, there would likely be a change in logic suggested as well - for example, since this is a sorting algorithm, maybe "take the lowest item from the list, then call rec() again with the rest of the list and return that extracted element followed by the result of rec(n-1)"
[23:50:36] <tm604> there are many other ways to approach that type of problem, but generally for this type of task I'd start by asking "how would you break this into smaller pieces"
[23:51:12] <tm604> you understand why the original version works for sorting, though? best to be clear on what the existing code is doing before making changes!

[23:52:26] <Guest9> can all problems which can be solved using FOR/while loop be solved by recurision as well?
[23:53:18] <Guest9> does recursion(it) simplify code & shorten number of lines?
[23:53:19] <Guest9> does it reduce complexity?
[23:53:19] <Guest9> or some problems can be solved only by recusion?

[23:53:40] <mst> Guest9: eh?
[23:54:03] <tm604> depending on the language, it can be more common to go the other way: start with the easy recursive implementation, then convert it into the iterative, more efficient version
[23:54:04] *** Quits: LuksNuke (~LuksNuke@94.242.245.63) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:54:34] <tm604> functional programming tends to be a good fit for recursion, imperative typically favours iteration
[23:54:35] <Grinnz> recursion is usually easier to write but slower - but yeah, depends on the language
[23:54:42] <Grinnz> and depends on the problem you're solving

[23:58:43] <tm604> also I guess Perl would have a slightly unfair advantage here due to tail-call
[23:58:54] <par> isn't python lack tail recursion?
[23:59:16] <par> I tried textbook fibonanci of Perl Memoize with python once, didn't work so well
