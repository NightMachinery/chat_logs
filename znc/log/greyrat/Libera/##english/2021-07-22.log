[12:50:33] <Babar> "The answer of James (the guy on the left)" just seems...more cumbersome

[12:57:10] <Babar> again, these would work in these specific situations, but what about all the others?
[12:57:45] <Babar> or are you saying there will always be a way to remove the requirement for the 's? And that in the cases involving these bracketed honorifics or descriptors, they should always be used?
[12:57:53] <amber_> Babar: apostrophe is not always replaceable.
[12:58:25] <amber_> Babar: but the description is not always required, i suppose.
[12:58:51] <ksft> I would usually try to avoid the genitive marker
[12:59:19] <ksft> if I can't, or in casual speech, I would put it after the modifier in most cases
[13:00:14] <amber_> Babar: in any case, the brackets do signify a break from the syntax. so using an apostrophe with the noun should not be a problem.
[13:01:22] <amber_> Babar: something like "John's (i don't know his real name) answer was satisfying" looks fine to me.

[13:02:42] <amber_> how did it change my nick?
[13:02:44] <twb> If they've got a lot of honorific crap you'd probably bind a pronoun to them anyway
[13:03:52] <Babar> that only works in non-bracketed honorifics, though, no? James the Lesser's answer or "Richard the Third's answer"
[13:05:02] <amber_> Babar: bracketed honorifics like "P.B.U.H." don't make a lick of sense.
[13:05:44] <twb> yhwh's fanboys are all pretty senseless IMO
[13:05:49] <amber_> Babar: in Arabic they probably fall smoothly into the syntactical structure of the sentence. they should be avoided.
[13:05:52] * Babar shrugs
[13:05:57] <Babar> it is part of the english language now :D
[13:06:18] <amber_> twb: it has nothing to do with YHWH. it's a tradition.

[13:08:34] <amber_> twb: i don't know if the Jewish God is the same as the Islamic God, but attaching honorifics is neither specific to Prophet Muhammad nor a prescription from God in Islam.

[13:10:47] <Babar> I think it was done in arabic, and with more recent transferring of such phrases and contexts into english, it just became more common

[13:11:06] <amber_> Babar: it doesn't stand out like that in Arabic.

[13:11:30] <Babar> or...modern arabic?
[13:11:56] <amber_> Babar: in regular discourse, nobody would prefix the name with "Prophet". the "P.B.U.H." itself serves to identify him as a prophet.

[13:39:38] <Babar> Spanish doesn't have anything like that, at least :D
[13:40:15] <Babar> although I think some asian languages add "Hazret" to the start instead?
[13:40:33] <amber_> Babar: no. the English speakers didn't coin "P.B.U.H." as far as i know.
[13:41:02] <amber_> Babar: i think it was coined by the missionaries so the honorific in Arabic doesn't seem weird to their target audience.
[13:41:17] <amber_> Babar: to born Muslims, it's a familiar expression.
[13:42:45] <Babar> but...if the missionaries were coining it, they were english speakers
[13:43:04] <Babar> I don't think you can coin a phrase in a language if you don't speak that language, but that might be getting philosophical

[13:45:03] <Babar> it's not just PBUH for them all?
[13:45:53] <amber_> Babar: there are many different honorifics for many different hierarchies of greatness.
[13:46:31] <twb> This reminds me of in Weatherwax stories where they add "may-she-rest-in-peace" after mentioning a dead person
[13:47:06] <pussipupu> not as common as it was but some people still say that for the dead
[13:47:13] <amber_> twb: it's common, right?
[13:47:57] <twb> eh.... not super common
[13:48:00] <pussipupu> Possibly based on some of the beliefs that names call forth the spirits of the dead, and therefore you need to counteract that
[13:48:01] <erroneous> it's absence in some language eg saint
[13:48:15] <amber_> the best thing is that there is no consensus for sainthood of a person as in Catholic Church. so, if i choose i could use the honorifics for sainthood to any person i consider a saint.
[13:48:16] <twb> the characters in those stories are old hill people

[14:01:02] <twb> amber_: well in the UK you're essentially Christian by default
[14:01:06] <pussipupu> especially with the monarchy and theocracy, meaning many would express their nationalism via amongst other things shows of religiosity
[14:01:33] <twb> amber_: but that doesn't mean you actually do anything exept turn up to weddings and funerals, and maybe christmas

[14:03:02] <pussipupu> especially as one would turn up to ceremonies in other religions if invited
[14:03:20] <twb> amber_: USA overall has religiousness equivalent to a developing country

[14:04:06] <pussipupu> I don't know that there's much anti Christian sentiment in the UK

[14:22:06] <amber_> even if all religion is eradicated from the face of the earth, new ones would pop up the next day.

[14:27:32] <twb> amber_: i.e. "people will be nailed to doors regardless" is an argument for not actively removing religion, but it's not an argument for *keeping* religion

[18:41:42] <twb> gryffus: wouldn't that be pretty much all romance, germanic, slavic languages at least?
[18:42:27] <gryffus> I don't have the same sense for english language as for czech, since its not my primary, but i see it that in english, non-living nouns do not have to have gender, or am i mistaken?
[18:42:41] <twb> gryffus: like in Spanish, "problema" (problem) is gramatically masculine and "mesa" (table) is grammatically feminine.
[18:42:43] <gryffus> twb: dunno, i am not language expert, i'm just wondering
[18:43:29] <xsznix> GuiToris: hm, I can't say that I've heard anyone refer to something as a cupboard recently… more commonly I refer to them as a "pantry" (closet for storing food) or "cabinet" (shelf for dishes, silverware, spices, etc.)
[18:44:05] <huf> gryffus: most languages in europe have grammatical gender
[18:44:20] <gryffus> twb: in czech "problem" (problém) is masculine and "table" (stůl) is masculine too. But "floor" (podlaha) and "chair" (židle) are feminine
[18:44:21] <GuiToris> xsznix, so it's related to kitchen
[18:44:26] <twb> gryffus: Dyirbal has four grammatically genders.  One for men and animals, one for fruit and vegetables, one for water, fire, women, and special animals, and one for everything else
[18:44:39] <xsznix> GuiToris: yes, unless you're talking about Harry Potter in which case it's related to stairs
[18:44:52] <GuiToris> it's not an ordinary furniture with doors

[18:46:16] <xsznix> "cupboard" isn't a common word in my circles at all
[18:46:20] <twb> GuiToris: "kitchen cupboard" would be very common, but you also have "linen cupboard"
[18:46:29] <xsznix> we have shelves, cabinets, pantries, closets
[18:46:56] <twb> of course the "linen" is actually made of cotton
[18:47:07] <GuiToris> xsznix, the dictionary says it's a wardrobe in BrE (a piece of furniture like a large cupboard that you hang clothes in)
[18:47:10] <gryffus> cupboard is a cabinet for dishes, no?
[18:47:23] <xsznix> I thought it was a cabinet for dishes
[18:47:28] <twb> gryffus: probably etymologically, but I certainly wouldn't assume that
[18:47:40] <huf> gryffus: https://wals.info/feature/30A#2/26.7/149.1
[18:47:43] <xsznix> but I also don't think I've ever heard the word used outside of the Harry Potter series

[18:51:58] <xsznix> only pronouns (he, she) and certain words referring to humans (actor, actress) or animals (cock, hen) have innate gender
[18:52:09] <GuiToris> ^yeah, unless it's your car and you have an unhealthy relationship with it. In that case it's 'her'
[18:53:25] <twb> xsznix: and a few edge cases, such as boats
[18:53:58] <gryffus> twb: lol same gender for men and animals? :D hehe in czech, we have femine for : cat (kočka), squirrel (veverka), water (voda), and so on... And masculine for fire (oheň), dog (pes) etc... But animal (zvíře) is "neutral", since you cannot know gender from word "animal"... Same is "fruit" - neutral. But "banana" (banán) is masculine and "strawberry" (jahoda) is femine. It makes perfect sense to me, but i wonder if this also makes sense for englis
[18:53:58] <gryffus> h speakers?
[18:54:02] <xsznix> I think boats are inconsistent, though. Seafarers may tend to refer to boats as "she" but for the rest of us I'd wager "it" is more common
[18:54:29] <twb> xsznix: agreed
[18:54:36] <xsznix> In general, we don't assign grammatical gender to words that have no natural gender
[18:55:31] <huf> I think the case of actor/actress is a different thing from grammatical noun classes
[18:56:09] <gryffus> BTW , isn't "cupboard" based on word "cup" and as such invoke feeling of "board/cabinet for cups" ? This is exactly what we have been taught.
[18:56:20] <xsznix> huf: yeah, thinking about it, you're right
[18:57:16] <twb> re cupboard, there was historically a kind of glass-fronted box for displaying fancy plates
[18:57:20] <GuiToris> gryffus, Origin: cupboard ‘shelf or table for cups’ (14-18 centuries)
[18:57:21] <twb> I'm trying to remember the word for it
[18:57:33] <gryffus> huf: thanks for the maps, btw! :)
[18:58:03] <twb> Also: what do you call the modern thing in bars where the glasses are suspended from the ceiling on a rail
[18:58:16] <twb> well, two rails, either side of the glass stem
[18:59:00] <gryffus> xsznix: yeah that is why in english you have this non-binary movement, but in Czech it can't really succeed IMO
[18:59:24] <huf> of course it could
[18:59:35] <twb> gryffus: note that grammatical gender is only distantly related to social gender
[19:00:10] <gryffus> boat (loď) is always femine in czech
[19:00:28] <gryffus> but port (přístav) is masculine
[19:00:28] <twb> Whether the word "fart" is male or female is separate from whether a specific person "Ms. Fart" identifies as a man or a woman (or hijra, or something else)
[19:00:57] <GuiToris> twb, as I looked 'cupboard' up I found numerous items, all of them are BrE. Do you also use them? kitchen-, bathroom-, hall-, bedroom-, built-in-, fitted-, wall-, storage-, food-, medicine-, clothes-, drinks-, airing-, linen-, broom- and bedside cupboard
[19:01:20] <gryffus> twb: yes, the box with class is exactly the cupboard what i mean
[19:01:21] <twb> GuiToris: pretty much all of those look normal to me
[19:01:37] <twb> e.g. "drinks cupboard" rather than "sideboard" or "tantalus"

[19:05:42] <gryffus> twb: "fart" (prd) is always masculine here. I mean, yes gramatical gender is not "social" gender. But when you think in czech language, it is not so distant. To be honest, i have very big trouble explaining difference between "sex" and "gender". We just do not have this differentiation and so we think "different"...

[19:36:03] <twb> szalami
[19:36:08] <CuriosTiger> Busz
[19:36:13] <CuriosTiger> that's the one that stood out to me.
[19:36:22] <twb> CuriosTiger: as in "autobus" ?
[19:36:32] <huf> this affects loan words in a funny way
[19:36:46] <twb> "bus" always makes me cringe slightly
[19:36:48] <huf> old loans kept the spelling and changed the pronunciation
[19:36:51] <CuriosTiger> I don't remember if Hungarian includes the "auto"
[19:36:57] <gryffus> Budapešť describes it pretty good IMO
[19:36:59] <huf> new loans keep the pronunciation and change the spelling
[19:37:05] <CuriosTiger> I think I remember seeing just Busz <whatever the word for stop is>
[19:37:10] <huf> CuriosTiger: you could say autóbusz but nobody does
[19:37:36] <CuriosTiger> huf: How do you say "bus stop"?
[19:37:41] <gryffus> Hehe "aautobus" and "bus" is used in czech too :D
[19:37:41] <huf> buszmegálló
[19:37:50] <gryffus> and bus stop is "autobusová zastávka"
[19:37:50] <twb> it confused me when Lovecraft wrote "electric trolley" where we would say "tram"
[19:37:55] <gryffus> (notice the "ová"
[19:38:55] <CuriosTiger> is -ová a genitive ending?
[19:39:03] <twb> Sorry I said "autobus" but of course I was thinking of "omnibus"
[19:39:13] <gryffus> well, thats because "zastávka" (stop) is a femine
[19:39:20] <gryffus> autobus is masculine
[19:39:28] <gryffus> so "autobusová zastávka"
[19:39:32] <CuriosTiger> Omnibus is even less used than autobus, unless you're thinking of the Latin plural of omnis.
[19:39:53] <gryffus> CuriosTiger: i don't know what Omnibus is xD
[19:40:11] <huf> horse-drawn bus
[19:40:14] <huf> rare nowadays
[19:40:15] <gryffus> Oh
[19:40:18] <LuisP14> mm, them busses for all!
[19:40:24] <CuriosTiger> It's the ultimate origin of the modern word bus. It's a Latin word meaning "all" or "everyone" -- but a particular plural of it.
[19:40:41] <twb> CuriosTiger: the part before you came in was, gryffus is saying non-binary people are hard in Czech language because "Dr. Ping" must be a man and "Dr. Pingova" must be a woman.  huf and I are... unconvinced.
[19:40:44] <gryffus> We have "autobus" - bus, "trolejbus" - electric bus, "taramvaj" - tram
[19:40:46] <CuriosTiger> so when they invented a vehicle to transport "everyone", Latin was still in vogue and the word got borrowed
[19:41:00] <huf> oh no I belive that it feels awkward
[19:41:06] <huf> I just dont think it's particularly hard in czech
[19:41:08] <CuriosTiger> and then "auto" replaced "omni" to signify self-propelled
[19:41:11] <huf> this sort of thing is gonna sound new everywhere
[19:41:13] <gryffus> twb: its the fact, sorry
[19:41:15] <twb> gryffus: "omnibus" meaning "for all", but clipped to just "bus" even though that's really part of "omnes" and not a separate word.
[19:41:19] <CuriosTiger> automobile omnibus -> autobus
[19:41:26] <CuriosTiger> and that got shortened to just bus
[19:41:48] <huf> we should start spelling it 'bus :D
[19:41:57] <CuriosTiger> I'm good with just bus.
[19:42:22] <CuriosTiger> Short, sweet and to the point, even if its etymology is a little funny.
[19:42:28] <huf> I always used to wonder why our old books spell "a" as "a'"
[19:42:31] <huf> turns out they were just weirdos

[19:43:48] <huf> gryffus: I have no idea what the "standard" says about it here...
[19:43:51] <twb> the best bus is the gyrobus
[19:43:52] <gryffus> English does not have word for czech word "spisovný" and "hovorový"
[19:43:55] <twb> it has no engine
[19:43:59] <huf> it might say tengelykapcsoló instead of kuplung
[19:43:59] <twb> it just has a flywheel
[19:44:04] <huf> but it's still kuplung
[19:44:11] <gryffus> spisovný is like word in dictionary
[19:44:22] <gryffus> and hovorový is word you say on street
[19:44:41] <gryffus> so bus is hovorový and autobus is spisovný
[19:46:15] <CuriosTiger> you can even say autobus in English
[19:46:26] <CuriosTiger> but it sounds very archaic.
[19:46:37] <CuriosTiger> huf: Kupplung.
[19:46:55] <huf> actually I think "auto" here is a foreign affectation that stuck as people got used to weird foreign vowels
[19:47:06] <CuriosTiger> or did the double p get dropped in the borrowing?
[19:47:07] <huf> the original solution was "ótó" :D
[19:47:13] <gryffus> Yeah, but not "Šalina" :D (its the word for tram, but only used in one city - Brno). So when you say that you are in "Šalina", every Czech knows that you are in a tram in Brno :D

[19:47:45] <CuriosTiger> huf: Short p in German too -- but in German, a double consonant indicates a short vowel follows.
[19:47:52] <huf> even when it's spelled kupplung, which it very well might be
[19:48:00] <huf> CuriosTiger: yeah nah, we dont do that stuff here
[19:48:19] <huf> except uh... sometimes, but it's not in the spelling
[19:48:21] <CuriosTiger> Norwegian does -- probably due to German influence
[19:48:29] <huf> and only done in nonstandard dialects
[19:48:42] <huf> like the one I have, from the capital, but still not the standard
[19:48:44] <CuriosTiger> Oh, when you get into dialects, all spelling conventions go right out the window
[19:48:47] <gryffus> Also, there is one parameter of czech language that is most problematic for every czech learning english. The spelling.
[19:49:04] <gryffus> In czech, we spell all letters just the same in every word and also when they are alone
[19:49:15] <CuriosTiger> gryffus: English spelling is a mess. I think it poses a challenge for literally everyone learning English -- including native speakers learning to read and write. :P
[19:49:31] <gryffus> so "e" does not sound as "i"... (i would have to say it, its hard to write)
[19:50:05] <gryffus> CuriosTiger: yes, agreed
[19:50:11] <CuriosTiger> Most languages have spelling conventions that don't quite follow pronunciation. It's almost inevitable, as pronunciation tends to change over time and spelling does not.
[19:50:17] <CuriosTiger> but English is extreme.
[19:50:30] <huf> it's old nobody could ever finish a full reform
[19:50:35] <huf> it was always partial fiddling
[19:50:39] <CuriosTiger> The only other European language I can think of that competes is French, where 60% of the letters are silent. :P

[19:50:53] <gryffus> s/hlad/glad/

[19:51:04] <CuriosTiger> I mean...how the heck do you need Guillaume to say Giom?
[19:51:49] <gryffus> yeah, and "cup" to say as "cap"
[19:52:03] <gryffus> and "man" say as "men" etc...
[19:52:15] <gryffus> anyway... "hlad" means "hunger" in czech... so im off guys

[20:52:28] <CuriosTiger> (same function as the small one, but the small one was too small.)
[20:52:39] <LuisP14> mm
[20:52:54] <bin> ohh interesting they have separated recycling
[20:53:02] <CuriosTiger> "This cart is only available to multi-family complexes"
[20:53:07] <bin> I don't remember if my dad's community had recycling, but if they did it was just one big bin

[20:53:15] <bin> lolol
[20:53:17] <CuriosTiger> Yeah, there is one bin for paper and cardboard, another for plastic/glass/metal
