[02:15:31] <zz> so at present, the only way I see to tackle this accurately is to set fesetround(FE_DOWNWARD) and then have INT32_MAX converted to float (with loss); you then get the last float value f that's accurate when converted to int
[02:16:10] <zz> but, you also need to cheat the compiler so it does not optimize ((float)INT32_MAX) into a float bit pattern at compile time

[02:35:33] <RandomReader> which assumes particular things about the floating point environment and that it's controllable, hmm...

[02:37:05] <RandomReader> like for the specific case of float and int32_t on a particular (common set of) platform, might as well just hardcode a hexfloat literal and compare
[02:37:15] <zz> (basically gmp reimplemented, partly)
[02:37:27] <RandomReader> can't do that without knowing the float representation though, which is also implementation-dependent

[12:49:46] <TinoDidriksen> MetalSutton, currentRing is an uint8_t - it is not an array or pointer to an array, so you can't [] it.
[12:51:12] <MetalSutton> so what does it need to be then?
[12:51:57] <TinoDidriksen> Depends on what you meant by it. If currentRing is supposed to point to the current ring array, then it should probably be uint8_t*
[12:55:00] <MetalSutton> I tried that just not. Its giving quite weird results.

[13:22:59] <The_Jag_> Hi, I'd like to implement a way to update the build number inside a source file each time a build is run. I tried to make a sh script to substitute a placeholder string with the updated build value but the problem I'm getting is that Makefile will reuse the original source file and not the updated one. How can I solve this? Thanks

[15:41:54] <wib_jonas> PJBoy: re "fraction/exponent", likely, http://www.quadibloc.com/comp/cp0201.htm supports the word "fraction" in that sense
[15:43:17] <PJBoy> that's a pretty random looking citation
[15:43:47] <PJBoy> but I accept it
[15:44:18] <PJBoy> > IBM, on the other hand, was even at an early date dissatisfied with the apparent misuse of the word mantissa, and referred to the two fields of a floating-point number as the "characteristic" and the "fraction" across architectures ranging from the IBM 704 to the System/360

[16:22:31] <wib_jonas> PJBoy: fair, the better citation is that Knuth's TAOCP chapter 4.2 calls them "fraction" and "exponent" (and also mentions "mantissa" and "characteristic" as alternate terms that it doesn't use). I only linked to John Savard's page about that because I recently read that

[23:53:11] <Alipha> pa: well, you're not supposed to have objects of std::aligned_storage directly, but instead use the type member, eg: std::aligned_storage<sizeof(int), alignof(int)>::type data;
[23:53:45] <Alipha> So here, data is a unsigned char array of size `sizeof(int)`
[23:54:05] <Alipha> In which case, data can be used as an unsigned char*
[23:55:04] <Alipha> Which you could then reinterpret_cast to int*
