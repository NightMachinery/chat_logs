[01:17:30] <lmat> I have several files like  0001-something 0002-somethingelse   and I need to change them to 0000-something and 0001-somethingelse.
[01:17:33] <lmat> How do I proceed?
[01:18:00] <smlavine> What have you tried?
[01:18:10] <lmat> I'm having trouble with the globbing. I have   for i in {0001..0009}; do remainder=$i*; remainder=${remainder:4}; echo $remainder; done;
[01:18:26] <lmat> No quotations on purpose to try to encourage globbing to occur, but I just get the "*" following me to my grave.
[01:18:33] <greycat> the result of a glob needs to be expanded to an array, not a string.
[01:18:42] <greycat> files=("$i"*) not files=$i*
[01:19:06] <lmat> greycat: I see. Even though it will only match one file. Excellent choice. Thank you.

[03:52:57] <greybot> The parameter _ is often used as a dummy variable in read commands to discard unwanted fields. It should not be used this way in portable scripts due to known conflicting usages in several common shells. See also: $_

[15:30:06] <Soliton> you can use -path if you like.

[15:30:47] <ExeciN> the expanded command looks like this find . -type f ! -path ./.git ( ! -iname CHANGELOG.md ! -iname CONTRIBUTING.md ! -iname CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md ! -iname README.md )

[15:31:25] <Soliton> -type f is for files.

[15:34:48] <ExeciN> I have a bunch of PCRE substitutions to perform in an arbitrary amount of files by also ignoring some directories (.git in this specific example but much more in real life) so first I'm filtering the paths and then parsing them to ripgrep
[15:35:44] <depesz> izabera: find was created LONG before tools that cause problems now that you use find and they exist (like git)

[15:37:09] <ExeciN> hmm... I didn't know -type location matters
[15:37:26] <osse> actually, ls-files has --untracked :p
[15:37:28] <geirha> it's a logical expression
[15:37:36] <Soliton> -type f means only files. if you put some -path check after it it's not going to do anything.
[15:37:45] <depesz> izabera: it's hard to assume find will know to treat .git specially, if there was no git when it (find) was written.
[15:37:59] <depesz> also - not sure what is your problem with find. i use it, and generally like.
[15:38:00] <Soliton> (if the -path check is supposed to match a dir.)
[15:38:17] <earnestly> Soliton: To list untracked files I tend to use git clean -n (-f)
[15:38:37] <ExeciN> people, .git in my example is irrelevant and only a test case since the test directory only has 2 directories in it, think of .git as a random non dot directory

[18:04:26] <transhumanist> this probably seems obvious to you bash wizards, but it is a relatively new revelation to me, If I am in a bash shell and am in  a directory I want to be in to do work (that I dont want to loose) l, I can enter "bash" at the command line and change to the new directroy I want to work with. To get back to the other directory all I have to do is type exit. It would however be better if there was a stack that I could simply select wh
[18:04:27] <transhumanist> session I desire to enter into IN THE SAME shell. Any way to do do this anyone knows of?

However when doing it with sed, I get "bad flag in substitute command" as the variable might contain special characters? How do I proceed? Escape the sed string and if how (must preserve new lines)? Use awk?

[23:51:35] <ash_worksi> is there an expansion which takes a substring of each element in an array?
