[06:23:22] <ItsLandon> I'm using sqlite for my db. I'm making a Discord bot, and the closest thing to DB experience I have is maintaining a spreadsheet for my job. One of the things I'm trying to wrap my head around is storing username history. I'm thinking that I'll have a users table with the user's hidden ID as the key since it doesn't change with a username change. Is there a nice way to store a list in a column for a
[06:23:25] <ItsLandon> single user or would I need to make a new table that I would reference by ID somehow? I'm pretty confused on what this would ideally look like.

[06:43:16] <thumbs> ItsLandon: use a separate table, with the user id as the FK reference.

[06:43:46] <thumbs> foreign key.
[06:44:01] <thumbs> a reference to the other table, so to speak
[06:45:18] <ItsLandon> Oh ok. So then the username would be the unique key. Thanks :)
[06:45:37] <thumbs> do you have a user ID auto-increment column?
[06:46:17] <ItsLandon> I haven't even gotten to that part yet. I could just do that, though. Would there be any reason to do that over just using the username as the key?
[06:46:43] <thumbs> ItsLandon: joining on an integer is often more efficient.
[06:46:46] <ItsLandon> My understanding is that usernames are guaranteed to not clash due to the discriminator
[06:46:50] <ItsLandon> Ah ok. Good to know
[06:47:16] <thumbs> for tiny tables, it won't make a difference, mind
[06:47:57] <thumbs> you can still use an auto-increment column for the user table primary key, and add a unique key on the username.
[06:48:01] <ItsLandon> Yeah. I don't really have any idea how large this will get, so it's probably a good idea for me to just implement good practices to begin with if they're not too much overhead.
[06:48:17] <ItsLandon> Too much mental overhead, I mean
[06:51:03] <ItsLandon> Are primary keys always unique? Or will I need to set it to be unique?

[07:40:56] <ItsLandon> I'm planning to have a table that has a list of items and who they belong to. I'd also like to have several tables that have some information about the items. The different tables are necessary because there are several types of items. Is there a best-practice for indicating which table contains additional information like this? 
[07:44:34] <Gizmokid2005> ItsLandon: there's lots of ways to do it. You can have an items table that is very simple, or it can contain all the attributes. Or you can have another "attribute" table that holds those attributes for the items.
[07:44:36] <ItsLandon> I'm imagining an "items" table with "id", "owner", "type", and "type_id" columns. "type" would be the name of the table, and "type_id" would be the id of the item's entry in the table containing items of it's type.

[09:10:26] <ItsLandon>  Gizmokid2005 What if an item could have one of two different types of attributes, and two tables contain those attributes? How would I specify which of the two tables the attributes could be found in?
[09:12:06] <Gizmokid2005> That's a bad design. You shouldn't partition your data that way. It's easy enough to do in a join (SELECT FROM items AS i LEFT JOIN attra ON a.id = i.id LEFT JOIN attrb ON b.id = i.id) but it suggests design problems.
[09:12:35] <Gizmokid2005> Have a single attribute table that contains the item id, the attribute_type/id (and a table that holds the "master" list of attributes for instance), and the value for the pair.
[09:16:09] <ItsLandon> I'm not following. I have a table with "owner", "id", "type", and "type_id". Is that not what you're talking about for the "single attribute table"? 
[09:21:14] *** Joins: cthulchu (~Cthulchu@69-172-160-196.cable.teksavvy.com)
[09:23:05] <Gizmokid2005> You would have an items table, that has item_id, name, desc, type_id; then a type table that has type_id, type; then an attribute table that has attribute_id, type_id, attribute_name, maybe some ancillary descriptors; then an item_attribute table that has item_id, type_id, attribute_id, value
[09:25:15] <ItsLandon> OK. I'm going to draw this out to help me understand. 
[09:31:27] <ItsLandon> So if I'm understanding this: the item_attribute table is a table with a list of attribute values and IDs to link them to an item from the items table. It sounds like I would need to put an autoincrement column into item_attribute, right? Or is a primary key unnecessary in this case since I'll never be referencing an individual value outside the context of an item?
[09:33:38] <Gizmokid2005> I'm of the opinion that autoincrement IDs are never a bad idea, their overhead is negligible and it's always better to have and not need it. However, a composite key could largely be determined by the combination of item_id, type_id, and attribute_id (assuming you won't have multiple of the same attribute per item).

[09:36:33] <ItsLandon> Ah ok. Yeah each item would have one value of a particular type. Is there a facility in sqlite's SQL dialect to enforce a unique composite key? I'm *very* new to sql so I've been having a rough time figuring out what to type into the search engines.
[09:37:07] <Gizmokid2005> Yes, you can use multiple columns as a primary key - ie PRIMARY KEY (item_id, type_id, attribute_id)
[09:43:55] <ItsLandon> mmmm this is good. Thank you for your insight. I've been struggling hard and this solved everything I've been worried about haha

[16:59:02] <Xgc> stark95: If you don't care about the order of the rows returned, remove it.  If you care, depending on the database, it might supported reverse ordered indexes, in which case you might be able to create an index to solve the problem, and keep the ORDER BY.
[17:00:24] <Xgc> stark95: There's no alternative to ORDER BY, if that's what you need.
[17:00:43] <stark95> thanks
