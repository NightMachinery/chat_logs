[09:09:48] <rb> you tell me
[09:09:51] <kline> (well, is, but he still lives with parents)
[09:09:59] <rb> i've lost one of my dogs earlier this year to old age
[09:10:22] <rb> it was pretty sad
[09:10:35] <rb> so i can understand your situation
[09:11:13] <pushcx> Yeah. I've lost pets before, odss actually look OK on this one? I don't mention it because it's not the biggest or smallest emergency, it's just last week's emergency. It was something else the week before last, and something else the week before.
[09:11:53] <kline> it all adds up
[09:11:54] <rb> i think the problem with the moderation thing is that nobody wants to be the kindergarten teacher who has to tell everyone to not run with scissors in hellthreads and then get blamed for picking a side or whatever
[09:12:11] <rb> janitorial duties are draining
[09:12:25] <rb> not to mention that they have to do it for free
[09:13:08] <kline> id generally be happy to take on what boring administrative stuff there is (renames, obvious off topics, hats, etc)
[09:15:34] <pushcx> I appreciate the offer, let me think on it a bit. I am trying to spend all my time thinking about trees this week.

[22:47:13] <kriive> Hi all, do you know any Computer Architecture illustrated websites? Possibly with an open licence, so that I can borrow the illustrations
[22:48:15] <kriive> I am searching for memory specifics, like stack structure illustrated in CSS or something like that. (Or else I will resorto to finally learn CSS and do them myself lol)

[23:42:51] <amazigh> kriive: what is Computer Architecture? Von Newmann things like that? or what?
[23:43:06] <amazigh> kriive: did you try a image search engine
[23:43:48] <kriive> amazigh: yeah, memory structure internals, like stack and heap and memory mappings, CPU registers
[23:44:14] <amazigh> like an encyclopedia of computers?
[23:44:20] <amazigh> never seen that
[23:44:45] <amazigh> it will make a great post on lobete.rs :)
[23:46:19] <kriive> because i'm try to learning (and teach to cementify my studies) some basic pwn techniques and to explain buffer overflows one has to grasp at least some basic memory structure to understand why flow gets redirected
[23:47:34] <kriive> sorry for my ugly english, i don't know why but tonight in particular my english grammar is out of control
