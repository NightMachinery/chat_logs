[17:31:44] <gthm> I love sqlite
[17:32:32] <gthm> at work I'm looking for a needle in a haystack of things that deserialize to millions of 50 or so integers
[17:32:55] <gthm> so I wrote a thing to dump all of it to csv, import it into sqlite, and now I can SELECT WHERE and be happy

[17:47:44] <gwozniak> ngoldbaum: ewww

[17:51:44] <jjuran> Explanation isn't justification.
[17:57:41] <gwozniak> Had a friend start to go on about how "sex = gender" is a scientific fact this weekend
[17:58:01] <gwozniak> Mixed with a lot of casual sexism

[18:04:15] <ngoldbaum> oh no has the terf spread from england
[18:05:30] <gwozniak> The friend in question has recently gone all-in on Catholicism.  I suspect that has a lot to do with his viewpoints
[18:06:01] <gwozniak> Also, lots of hints of "white men aren't allowed to say anything anymore" vibes
[18:06:52] <jjuran> I agree that chromosomal sex != gender, but I'm not convinced that "sex == chromosomal sex" is established usage.
[18:07:28] <gwozniak> The "I'm just asking questions" and "I'm just giving my opinion" justifications were at play, too
[18:07:38] <jjuran> In other words, "sex" can be synonymous with "gender", depending on the speaker.
[18:07:44] <gwozniak> So yeah, this long-time friend is on the edge
[18:08:17] <manicennui> Jesus is pretty obsessed with genitals.
[18:08:39] <companion_cube> good thing they never heard of intersex people
[18:09:20] <gwozniak> I suspect it's a refusal to believe such a thing exists on his part
[18:09:37] <jjuran> Are they advocated for by intersexional feminists? :-)
[18:09:39] <gwozniak> Also, complaints about the singular "they"
[18:10:20] <jjuran> What does that have to do with it?
[18:10:43] <gwozniak> It should be "he or she" and nothing else, according to him
[18:10:57] <companion_cube> good old masculinism
[18:11:01] <jjuran> Ah, then that's the issue.
[18:11:11] <companion_cube> I actually love singular they
[18:11:19] <companion_cube> prevents assumptions on people you don't know
[18:11:47] * manicennui refers to everyone as it.
[18:11:49] <jjuran> We could just say MMarklar
[18:11:57] <gwozniak> I'm not used to it, but I prefer it too.  I'll slip on it sometimes, but not on purpose
[18:12:53] <jjuran> I dislike singular "they" for multiple reasons, the most important of which is that it doesn't solve the problem it's supposed to.
[18:13:04] <companion_cube> sometimes my fiancée talks about a colleague, so I use `they` unless she specified their gender
[18:14:27] <ngoldbaum> what problem does it not solve?
[18:14:49] <ngoldbaum> seems to enable talking about someone without using genered pronouns pretty well to me
[18:15:35] <gwozniak> Another friend, who is the "sex = gender" friend's roommate, was going on about how women shouldn't be in charge where he used to work (he was let go recently).  I listened to his story and kind of did on "oh, rly?" and he backed off that assertion
[18:15:49] <jjuran> Aside from being singular-plural ambiguous, using "they" for an individual makes it unclear whether (a) you don't know the gender, (b) the gender is intersex, (c) the gender is actually male or female but the individual expressed a preference for "they", (d) the speaker doesn't care and just refers to everyone as "they", or (e) the referrent is a singular non-individual like "anyone" or "everyone" for whom determining a gender is
[18:15:49] <jjuran> logically impossible.
[18:16:27] <ngoldbaum> i’ve never had that problem, there’s usually context
[18:16:57] <edk> if it was good enough for austen it's good enough for me
[18:18:00] <companion_cube> maybe english should have gone all the way and just not used gender in pronouns
[18:18:06] <companion_cube> "they" does that
[18:18:31] <jjuran> Or invent new pronouns.  One set for intersex, one set for gender-neutral.
[18:18:57] <gwozniak> I thought that had been tried many times and it's never caught on
[18:19:10] <companion_cube> why do you need pronouns to be gendered?
[18:19:22] <edk> well, it adds redundancy
[18:19:29] <jjuran> Because "he" and "she" are long established and aren't going anywhere.
[18:19:29] <ngoldbaum> but why do i need to indicate what my genitals are to people in language?
[18:19:42] <companion_cube> it's as outdated as Ms/Mrs
[18:19:43] <edk> which i would imagine is why it's persisted even in languages like english and scandinavian that have lost their grammatical gender
[18:19:48] <manicennui> https://i.redd.it/w6fjtdgk73181.jpg
[18:19:53] <ngoldbaum> it certainly makes sense in the context of a patriarchal power structure, i’ll give you that
[18:20:42] <edk> i think it's just useful for communication; properties that partition about 50/50 are maximally informative
[18:21:13] <riv> > using "they" for an individual makes it unclear whether (a) (b) (c) (d) (e)
[18:21:18] <riv> that's fine though
[18:21:35] <jjuran> gwozniak: I'm not aware of it having been tried.
[18:21:40] <Geekingfrog> in oral chinese, you can't tell the difference between he and she, works just fine.
[18:21:59] <edk> if you were trying to say "xe's wearing a hat while xe is not" there's roughly a 50% chance that the two people's genders will disambiguate
[18:22:10] <edk> i'm not offering this as an argument that we still need them, btw
[18:22:22] <jjuran> Sure, individuals have made proposals, but they haven't caught on — so no, those haven't been tried.
[18:22:23] <riv> also i dont think intersex is a gender
[18:22:26] <edk> but i suspect that's mechanically useful enough that it won't evolve away on its own
[18:22:32] <edk> jjuran: what would trying it mean
[18:23:58] <jjuran> edk: Adoption.
[18:24:08] <edk> that would be succeeding
[18:24:23] <jjuran> Only if it sticks.
[18:24:31] <gwozniak> Okay, then perhaps I should say that various ones have been proposed
[18:24:38] <edk> no you shouldn't
[18:24:52] <edk> what you said was fine and jjuran is choosing to be incorrectly pedantic for some reason
[18:24:58] <riv> singular they is very good & lots of people use it
[18:25:20] <gwozniak> At any rate, I find singular 'they' to be fine
[18:25:41] <ngoldbaum> look what you’ve started geoff :p
[18:25:47] <gwozniak> Silly me!
[18:27:00] <gwozniak> I didn't grow up with it so it sounds awkward at times, but it tends to work, and is less troublesome than assuming "he" or "she" and getting it wrong
[18:27:36] <edk> yeah
[18:28:22] <Xe> edk: usually the main way that people disambiguate is by using different cases of the pronoun (eg: "xe gave that present to xer")
[18:28:24] <Xe> gwozniak: it's been in common usage since fucking Beowulf, it's just less common
[18:28:51] <Xe> and IIRC Beowulf was in old/middle english
[18:28:57] <riv> "This is my Beowulf cluster, they compute pi for me"
[18:29:14] <edk> Xe: i don't think that's the main way, it's just another way. subjective/objective also roughly splits the field in half, which is good, but it also doesn't always work
[18:30:02] <edk> it's also similar to gender in that english has lost (most) case distinction for everything except personal pronouns

[18:30:25] <edk> (or all, if you don't consider english possessive to be a case)
[18:30:52] <jjuran> I'm not comfortable with people telling me something is fine that I have an issue with.  Especially when my own preference is frequently violated.
[18:30:52] <companion_cube> riv: intersex might not be a gender, but it certainly refutes "ur dur only 2 sex and sex=gender"
[18:31:07] <edk> you should stop communicating with other humans then
[18:31:19] <jjuran> Yay, identity politics.
[18:31:22] <riv> I've never been comfortable with the argument that intersex people have anything to do with there being more than 2 genders
[18:31:24] <edk> not at all
[18:31:43] <riv> I think that nonbinary people are evidence that there's more genders
[18:31:52] <edk> what's correct english is determined by everyone currently speaking english
[18:31:52] <riv> and some intersex people are nonbinary, but some are not
[18:32:15] <jjuran> No, not everyone.  By those who speak the loudest.
[18:32:38] <edk> i don't think that's true in general
[18:32:45] <riv> jjuran: whats your preference
[18:33:06] <jjuran> For myself?  Standard male pronouns.  He/him/his/his.
[18:33:18] <riv> and people have been violating this?
[18:33:26] <edk> there are all kinds of outliers but in general languages tend to be pulled in the direction of the majority
[18:33:26] <jjuran> I get referred to as "they" all the time.
[18:33:37] <riv> I see
[18:33:37] <jjuran> That's not my preference.
[18:33:49] <riv> I will try not to do that
[18:34:48] <jjuran> It's mainly tech sites.  "This user joined 3 days ago.  Send them a message!" (or such)
[18:34:49] <edk> same, but i think it's unreasonable to ask people not to use "they" when they don't know what your preference is, since they... won't know that
[18:35:11] <jjuran> Hence the need for truly neutral words.
[18:35:20] <edk> meh
[18:35:23] <gerikson> I respect Catholicism for at least having an intellectual tradition for its beliefs
[18:35:29] <gerikson> sadly those beleifs are pants
[18:35:32] <edk> "they" is as neutral as it's going to get
[18:35:39] <riv> I don't understand. You are saying that "This user joined 3 days ago.  Send them a message!" is not gender neutral?
[18:35:57] <riv> but I thought you wanted male pronouns to be used?
[18:36:19] <edk> if it said "this user joined 3 days ago. send hir a message" there would still be people who didn't like that
[18:36:41] <gwozniak> gerikson: yes, I feel exactly the same way
[18:36:42] <edk> i don't think you will ever get closer to a pronoun that doesn't make any statement about its referent's gender than "they"
[18:36:56] <riv> they/them is gender neutral
[18:36:59] <edk> yeah
[18:37:24] <jjuran> Then how do non-binary folks express their gender?
[18:37:41] <riv> that depends on the person, there's a million ways
[18:37:48] <edk> they could say: "i'm non-binary"
[18:38:02] <riv> not everyone cares about pronouns for example. some nonbinary people just use whatever pronouns people assign to them
[18:38:10] <gerikson> gwozniak: I guess there's some sort of milquetoast mainstream lutheranism I can seek out ... *yawn*
[18:38:30] <jjuran> Oh, so it's not universally the mortal insult I was led to believe it was

[18:39:23] <companion_cube> riv: it's evidence there's more than 2 sex
[18:39:34] <companion_cube> and that biology is also not cookie-cutter simple binary
[18:39:39] <riv> yeah
[18:39:54] <edk> i don't think "they" connotes non-binary-ness specifically, it's just supposed to be a pronoun that doesn't convey any gender information at all
[18:40:04] <companion_cube> ^
[18:40:13] <edk> i think that's a useful thing to have independently of whether we need more pronouns
[18:40:30] <riv> there are some nonbinary specific pronouns like ve
[18:40:39] <riv> but people rarely use them except in very queer spaces
[18:42:17] <riv> ngoldbaum: damn. what the heck happened..
[18:42:28] <riv> is this a result of using discord?

[22:22:20] <manicennui> And they ship from a local store.
[22:22:26] <dminkovsky> black friday is pretty terrible
[22:22:36] <dminkovsky> muchless thanksgiving shopping
[22:22:39] <manicennui> Why do you hate the economy?
[22:22:50] <dminkovsky> Because I hate America
[22:23:06] <dminkovsky> .
[22:23:18] <dminkovsky> sigh can't type anything
[22:23:21] <manicennui> OMG Love it or leave it!
[22:23:37] <dminkovsky> okay fine i love it
[22:26:00] <riv> Anyone seen 76 Days?

[22:45:43] <indigo> manicennui: I like TJ Maxx and Ross for home goods too
[22:47:58] <manicennui> This background episode of Cowboy Bebop is really meh.
[22:48:11] <riv> try the anime :)
[22:48:22] <manicennui> riv: I probably will at some point.
[22:48:28] <manicennui> Nearly finished with this now.
[22:48:32] <riv> omg you've not seen it??
[22:48:38] <riv> lucky you!
[22:48:39] <manicennui> Nope.
[22:49:44] <manicennui> This episode just feels like a gangster show set in the modern day where everyone drives cars from the past.
[22:50:49] <manicennui> Very little of this show feels futuristic.
[22:51:07] <manicennui> I'm guessing due to budget.
[22:51:34] <imode> that bebop seinfeld bit killed my desire to watch it.
[22:51:47] <imode> nUtBaGs
[22:51:48] <manicennui> heh
[22:54:17] <manicennui> Setting aside comparisons to the original show, I just don't know what I think about this.
[22:54:27] <manicennui> Jet is probably the only really likably character.
[22:55:31] <bkero> I haven't gotten to watch it yet. I've been dogsitting and I'll turn that show up too much and will spook him.
[22:55:47] <bkero> Since I want to really hear the background music since it's one of my favorite soundtracks.
[22:55:55] <bkero> Even if the show ends up trash: https://kotaku.com/netflix-cowboy-bebops-existence-now-justified-by-new-yo-1847057030
[22:55:55] <buttsbot> Netflix Cowboy Bebop's Existence Now Justified By New Yoko Kanno Music
[22:57:25] <manicennui> Every other episode of this show ends with Spike near dead.
[22:57:46] <riv> I will listen to the music
[22:58:02] <riv> manicennui: man you should just watch the anime first, dont waste your time on the live action
[22:58:15] <manicennui> I'm on the final episode now.
[22:58:31] <riv> i tried to save you, thats all i can say
[22:58:55] <manicennui> I'll be okay.
[22:59:03] <manicennui> I've wasted a good part of my life on mediocre television.
[22:59:23] <ngoldbaum> the soundtrack is good
[23:00:53] <indigo> I mean, aren't there some shows that you just hate-watch? :P
[23:01:43] <manicennui> There are definitely shows that I hate finished.
[23:01:48] <manicennui> Like The 100.
[23:02:35] <riv> good version first
[23:02:52] <gwozniak> I don't mind watching a not-so-amazing show
[23:03:23] <indigo> I've been watching Wheel of Time
[23:03:51] <indigo> It's decent, very LotR-yt
[23:03:51] <manicennui> gwozniak: I don't mind it, but I've spent far too much time doing it.
[23:04:19] <manicennui> The 100 had some interesting ideas, but most of it was CW level drama.
[23:13:26] <manicennui> The problem with the live action Cowboy Bebop relying mostly on pretty modern day sets for most scenes is that they aren't good enough to make the show interesting.
[23:13:36] <manicennui> They're just typical gangster cliche stuff.
[23:14:48] <manicennui> Seems like they just completely gave up on anything futuristic in the last two episodes.
[23:15:36] <ngoldbaum> they were never going to pull that off on their budget
[23:15:53] <ngoldbaum> so they didn’t really try
[23:18:13] <indigo> Should've hired Denis Villeneuve for it
[23:18:21] <indigo> Then it would be all about the futuristic sets
[23:18:36] <manicennui> It's not just about the futuristic elements.
[23:18:40] <manicennui> The pace seems far too slow.
[23:19:44] <manicennui> And the tone seems too serious most of the time.
[23:22:37] <manicennui> A lot of people complain that the actor who plays Spike is too old, but it seems to me that the problem is that he just seems tired and worn out most of the time.
[23:22:42] <manicennui> He doesn't seem sly.
[23:23:08] <manicennui> There was a little bit of that at the beginning, but it was basically gone by halfway through the season.
[23:25:25] <manicennui> "Jet was the closest to his anime portrayal and they still for some reason made him dumb and an absent father (after making him black wow netflix, nice stereotyping)"
[23:25:50] <ngoldbaum> john cho’s always going to be harold to me
[23:26:11] <manicennui> I've never seen that movie because I wasn't into pot culture.
[23:26:12] <ngoldbaum> so it’d be really hard for him to effectively pull off world-weary blazé for me
[23:52:57] <gerikson> just call the fake money "crapto" like I do https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29306829
[23:52:58] <buttsbot> Cryptographers are not happy with how you’re using the word ‘crypto’ | Hacker News
[23:54:21] <manicennui> "there's orders of magnitude more people interested in get-rich-quick schemes than in abstract algebra"
[23:54:27] <manicennui> I think that pretty much sums it up.
