[00:26:37] <Atque> kuolex: There's psychological and endocrine papers about it? You could have a virtue ethics theory "gluttony's a sin", but then what's gluttony. There are more general treatments of duties of self-preservation and so forward in Kantian ethics, which might be interesting.
[00:28:53] <coeus> gluttony is when you've had enough to eat but you decide to keep eating eating instead until your fat

[01:46:05] <Samian> trbp  good catch!
[01:47:17] <trbp> Samian: i think it is too technical maybe
[01:47:48] <Samian> yeah you're right.  I shouldn't waste my time
[01:47:54] <Samian> or money
[01:48:00] <trbp> with people get to belive something it is more like you need to speak to their emotions and not to their mind
[01:49:03] <trbp> so simple cheap chemistry or physical tricks could trigger maybe the right interest to later on free willingly go into such thematics
[01:50:34] <Samian> yeah, my cousin is a lost cause. It's his parents fault
[01:50:38] <tinwhiskers> you could do the CO2 warming a bottle thing. It's simple, can be used to do control and treatment and starkly demonstrates global warming.
[01:50:44] <trbp> how old?
[01:50:55] <Samian> he's 39
[01:51:46] <trbp> at that age you must find things of his interest fields to combine with such as tinwhiskers suggested
[01:52:07] <trbp> people pretty stubborn as older they get
[01:52:43] <tinwhiskers> yeah, and they are likely intellectually dishonest or stupid anyway. Lost cause. :-)
[01:52:53] <tinwhiskers> there's a slim chance it's just ignorance but unlike.y
[01:53:01] <Samian> grew up in San Diego. Parents spent 250k for him to get a degree in photography his supposed passion. After school he can't find work to self sustain himself. Parents buy him a house. He airbnbs half of it out making 60k a year doing that. He's a kid in an adult body.
[01:54:14] <trbp> tinwhiskers: it is never too late, though it can be tougher though as one own lost the 'language' needed to resonate interest into someones mindset
[01:54:25] <tinwhiskers> yah
[01:54:35] <trbp> teaching is actually one of the hardest jobs if we are frank
[01:55:08] <trbp> not that shit done with our masses of teachers and edu systems
[01:55:45] <trbp> building up willingly stupid donkeys running after carrots to be nice and hardworking labor bees somehow for the elites ;)
[01:56:27] <trbp> with so called free mind building corresponding to each political system that is lived in their lands ;) lol
[01:56:49] <trbp> real freedom of mind and knowledge is dangerous, as the masses are not so controllable anymore ;)
[01:57:30] <Samian> His older sister is a high achiever, working as an executive director at some big company.    It's find if my cousin believes in dumb stuff, but it gets dangerous when it circles back to family.   He's telling me on the phone that everyone in the family are blind followers who don't question. He thinks covid is a "plandemic". He says everyone is against him.  He gave me some links I looked at regarding the "plandemic". He said no one else
[01:57:30] <Samian>  in the family even bothered to pay him any attention.
[01:57:40] <trbp> it is a pity how many diploma idiots we have in the world, all well educated idiots so to speak....

[01:59:26] <trbp> well plandemic or not some things could have been done way different with sars-cov-2 and covid though
[01:59:38] <Samian> This is becoming very typical. There's a uneducated conspiracy theorist in the family. Family begins to ignore their ridiculous fb posts.  The adult kid gets his feelings hurt and thinks his own family is against him.

[02:01:39] <trbp> Samian: well it would fit again the conspiracy theory
[02:02:01] <trbp> single your slaves out so that they even not have any trust in their nearest ;)

[02:02:47] <trbp> is it a result of shortsighted profit or image gain of profiteurs, more likely though
[02:03:19] <trbp> there is no need for consiracy some kind of exaggerations happen in resonance systems sometimes
[02:03:45] <trbp> and fear induced about life-threatening events could speed things up....
[02:04:40] <trbp> and our so well educated folks around be it the not so beread workerbee or the elite educated well earner are all fearing their own fate...
[02:05:11] <Samian> tinwhiskers  why would they be intellectually dishonest?
[02:05:11] <trbp> looking for fast answers where time and thorough data analaysis would be of more need
[02:06:52] <tinwhiskers> They have political or ideological reasons to dislike science that do not stand up to reason, so either intellectually dishonest, ignorant or stupid.
[02:06:54] <trbp> for one it is easier to belive in chemtrails for the other one it is easier to belive that a thorough vaccination is depending on a % of all of the others to be safe ;)
[02:07:11] <tinwhiskers> heh. yeah.
[02:07:30] <trbp> tinwhiskers: forgive me if i say this as a former science lover
[02:08:10] <trbp> with todays kind of science and its results i tend to see eversomore same dishonesty ignorant stupidity in science itself ;)
[02:09:04] <tinwhiskers> there's always been bad science and bad actors. It comes to light sooner or later. It's self-correcting in that regard but may take some time.

[10:52:56] <trillian> i got 2 doses of the vaccination but some very nice people i know just don't like the idea of being forced to do it either, or losing their job if they don't get it and they want to stand up for people who are pressured into getting it
[10:53:40] <I_Am_M00t> lol, i recently found out Clapton was kind of a racist jerk, after he stood up for antivaxxers
[10:53:48] <brigand> so people have the freedom to get sick and infect other people xD
[10:53:53] <brigand> *should have
[10:53:55] <trillian> Eric Clapton?
[10:54:09] <I_Am_M00t> yeah... unless i'm completely misremembering
[10:54:28] <I_Am_M00t> he wanted to open concerts for unvaccinated ppl, and then his past history went viral
[10:55:21] <trillian> well i see their point as it is something inside their body it's not like a mask or a seat belt or helmet it's sort of a medical procedure and i think our consitution says something about no medical procedures without consent
[10:56:04] <trillian> so if they are being pressure to by losing their ways to lose their family sort of maybe is not really with their consent by by coersion
[10:56:19] <trillian> but having said that...i hope everyone choses voluntarily to get vaccinated and that the vaccinations work
[10:56:28] <trillian> but i just don't want to force anyone
[10:56:31] <I_Am_M00t> yeah well, people don't volunteer, is the issue
[10:56:48] <I_Am_M00t> so politicians have to make a real-life decision
[10:56:56] <trillian> s/lose/feed
[10:56:56] <ro-bot-o> trillian meant to say: so if they are being pressure to by losing their ways to feed their family sort of maybe is not really with their consent by by coersion
[10:57:09] <trillian> hmm

[10:57:23] <trillian>  a girl i know from highschool she has this view point i just spoke of
[10:57:40] <I_Am_M00t> it's one thing if people are educated on the topic and don't take it, it's another thing when you have propaganda machines brainwashing people into thinking vaccines are the devil
[10:57:45] <trillian> i suppose they were never vaccinated for anything and i have to hand it to them their entire family looks so healthy and sort of like angelic in how healthy they are
[10:58:11] <trillian> yeah i agree with you on that I_Am_M00t
[10:58:18] <iridium__> trillian: like a peasant girl?
[10:58:22] <trillian> there are people just saying all sorts of misinformation
[10:58:40] <trillian> i think they are seven day adventist or something
[10:58:47] <brigand> anecdotal fallacy
[10:58:48] <I_Am_M00t> it's not like people have gone through an informed decision making process
[10:58:58] <trillian> i just read some of their posts and they were saying there were no exceptions in au
[10:59:17] <I_Am_M00t> for instance, i had a friend who thought the risk of blood clots was very high, and didn't want to take it
[10:59:30] <I_Am_M00t> it wasn't a calculated choice, it was one based on misinformation
[10:59:40] <trillian> they are nice people, religious, wont eat pork, they are sort of like as jewsih as you get as a Christian, they mark the Sabbath on Fri/Sat, they don't eat pork but kosher i think
[10:59:49] <I_Am_M00t> well, he still hasn't taken it i guess

[11:00:32] <trillian> yes that is true the risk of blood clot is much higher if you get covid than from the vaccination i read
[11:00:50] <iridium__> i think the older generation has a very different model of information validation as they were not exposed to the internet in their young years. they read stuff in newspapers and magazines which can publish misinformation but there still is a screening process to weed out the absolute nonsense, i believe.
[11:01:09] <trillian> i suppose they might be in the situation where they will lose their job by not getting the vax potentially
[11:01:44] <I_Am_M00t> and even then, what if they could get something other than AZ?
[11:01:49] <trillian> that is true iridium__ and i find even mainstream media gives conflicting information which can't all be right which makes it hard to sift through or know what to think
[11:01:52] <iridium__> at least that's the condition with my parents and their parents, etc. they literally seem to believe anything being passed on the social media as absoute facts.
[11:01:53] <brigand> trillian: are you saying people are forced to get vaccinated in australia? by whom?
[11:02:35] <I_Am_M00t> this is like those old days when there was the occasional funny but edited video and people believed an innocent lie
[11:02:48] <I_Am_M00t> except now it's literally affecting people's opinion on policy
[11:02:56] <trillian> brigand, well in some occupations they must be vaccinated by a certain date i think to keep working in that job, well they do not class that as forcing but i suppose to that person it might feel like it, i don't know what the answer is, i am sad if someone might die of covid when they could have lived if they just got the vaccination but then i don't want to tell others what to do or forced them to do anything
[11:03:56] <brigand> right
[11:04:12] <trillian> like people in frieght, police, in medical fields
[11:04:16] <brigand> people should have the freedom to get sick and infect other people
[11:04:17] <trillian> stuff like that
[11:04:41] <trillian> so you are a fan of manditary vaccinations for everyone brigand ?
[11:05:22] <trillian> I hope everyone or nearly everyone choses to voluntarily but I don't want to force anyone
[11:05:26] <brigand> everybody who's healthy, yes
[11:05:50] <I_Am_M00t> a lot of things are mandatory in society, and nobody really complains
[11:06:07] <I_Am_M00t> for some reason the vaccine is the last straw, because "it goes into your body"
[11:06:35] <trillian> would you want forced dental work and medical operations?
[11:06:59] <trillian> that you didn't want
[11:07:20] <trillian> i guess i sort of see it like that, in the end probably their choice
[11:07:33] <trillian> after weighing the pros and cons themselves
[11:08:13] <brigand> are these dental or physical problems pandemic?
[11:08:54] <trillian> i see your point and i am mostly in agreeance with you that people should get vaccinated but i just stop at the idea anyone should be forced to
[11:09:33] <brigand> let's agree to disagree on that point then :)

[14:25:47] <amigojapan> blkshp: I dont think ir carries any memory from each time it reproduces
[14:26:22] <blkshp> To be honest, i don't know anything about it's lifecycle just that it can basically live forever and is a jellyfish!
[14:27:26] <amigojapan> Yeah. It goes thru a rebirth after a while and stars again as a baby
[14:28:29] <blkshp> I might actually have a look later :D
[14:28:37] <amigojapan> It makes a clone of itself then the large body dies
[14:28:44] <amigojapan> Ok
[14:29:02] <DPA> Does a jellyfish even have memories?
[14:29:43] <amigojapan> DPA: if it has a brain probably so. Even if very basic
[14:30:12] <amigojapan> Rats are smaller and have memories
[14:30:40] <amigojapan> DPA: it's testable with a maze
[14:31:36] <DPA> Rats are comparatively a lot more sofisticated animals. Most things that have to survive on land are complicated.
[14:31:42] <amigojapan> You can make a maze for water
[14:32:16] <pussipupu> Jellyfish don't have brains per se, I don't know to what extent they have memory though
[14:32:39] <pussipupu> Plants and fungi have at least some capacity for memory

[19:24:25] <slothpaw> pussipupu i just gave u 2 links to the easiest digestible sources of data from the best knowns academics in the community avail on the generally unkown aspects of water worth looking into particularly for health benefits
[19:24:25] <slothpaw> that was kinda my original point why not just take the word of someone who has spent the years looking at the data to save you the bother
[19:24:25] <slothpaw> but like you say im happy as well to agree to disagree and wish you best of luck
[19:29:45] <audrey> this isn´t really the best venue for those kinds of theories
[19:30:37] <pussipupu> No, you demanded I watch “ALL the videos” from your YouTube playlist and read a book
[19:30:44] <slothpaw> "he channel's bread-and-butter are the traditional fields of academic philosophy such as metaphysics"
[19:31:07] <slothpaw> metaphysical aspects of water has no relavance here?
[19:31:15] <pussipupu> Videos from a conference aren't data, if it exists I'd be interested in it but just link to the paper not to tens of hours of video
[19:32:27] <slothpaw> they are videos from acamemics in the field i am refering to that summarises their lifetimes work, hence saving you trawling through reams of papers like ive done
[19:32:32] <audrey> conspiratorial aspects of water have no particular relevance here
[19:33:05] <arryana> might as well link to the flat earth 'academics'
[19:33:05] <audrey> maybe take a look at the «resources» and «Research index» links in the /topic to see what kind of sources/discursive methods are most appreciated here
[19:33:10] <pussipupu> That' s not what “data” means
[19:33:19] <pussipupu> I don't see any conspiratorial claims on the channel at least
[19:33:41] <pussipupu> I don't know about the what's in the vast playlist for obvious reasons :þ
[19:34:36] <arryana> anything for traffic/ads, these days.  all they need is an agenda and enough gullible people.
[19:34:58] <audrey> idk i see «youtube» and stuff about «truth» and am like, ok I can guess where this is headed
[19:35:06] <audrey> anyway I´m off to read more Lady Chatterley´s Lover
[19:35:37] <arryana> any good?
[19:36:14] <audrey> Yes, very well written and with some universal themes
[19:36:32] <audrey> Some of the prose is a bit wooden - DH Lawrence trying to be «modern» but stuck in the Victorian mindset
[19:36:34] <arryana> excellent, i will stick it on the list, thanks.
[19:36:42] <arryana> fair enough
[19:36:56] <audrey> but on the whole, compelling reading, as long as you´re OK with the flowery Victorian digressions
[19:37:10] <audrey> it´s also ... quite an explicit book in parts and I can understand why it was banned in the US/UK for 30 years
[19:37:17] <audrey> but in a pretty tasteful way
[19:38:57] <pussipupu> I tend to be a bit conservative in some linguistic ways such as using “conspiratorial” to refer to things referring to actual or theorised conspiracies which is what I don't see here
[19:39:53] <pussipupu> Mostly because the broader uses of that term don't seem to be analytically useful categories(at least en masse, they might well be as used but people use them in such varied ways that it's basically impossible to know how it's being used without expansion)
[19:42:09] <arryana> i lived with hippies too long to be shocked.

[22:52:03] <audrey> What does Texas have to do with DH Lawrence?
[22:52:15] <kmh_> there will be only proper decent christian literature in US libraries
[22:52:35] <kmh_> audrey, it's likely to kill him in the culture war
[22:52:51] <audrey> Well it´s the «woke» side that is opposed to DH Lawrence
[22:52:53] <kmh_> they ain't gonna stop at abortion
[22:53:01] <audrey> he´s oddly enough become a kind of hero among certain right wingersa
[22:53:03] <audrey> -a
[22:53:33] <kmh_> until they actually read them i suppose
[22:53:57] <audrey> Works like Lady Chatterley have been accused of the usual ... sexism etc.
[22:54:28] <audrey> As have Lolita, Tropic of Cancer and other controversial but undisputed classics of the 20th century.
[22:54:36] *** Joins: cisme_ (~cisme_@108-218-190-101.lightspeed.frsnca.sbcglobal.net)
[22:54:38] <kmh_> that's like conservatives (in particular Reagan) used to like Springsteen's "Born in the USA" until they finally bothered to listen to the zext
[22:54:46] <audrey> (Actually provided a motivation for me to read those books.)
[22:55:15] <kmh_> audrey, well i guess there is sexism in there, but so what?
[22:55:17] <audrey> But yeah, I´m skeptical of the «GOP banning books» hysteria
[22:55:33] <audrey> kmh_, that´s kind of the point
[22:55:53] <audrey> good literature challenges you
[22:56:34] <kmh_> dunno gopster banning books is more serious to me than woke nutters, but i'm not in the US and historical context here is a bit different
[22:56:49] <kmh_> audrey,  yes
[22:57:10] <audrey> I don´t see that happening on a major scale in the near future
[22:57:43] <kmh_> and just because something is controversial or somewhat off from modern perspective, it doesn't mean you can't or shouldn't read it anymore
[22:58:22] <audrey> Preaching to the choir here :3
[22:58:24] <kmh_> and in particular college should teach people to contextualise material not not turning it into personal drama
[22:58:29] <audrey> I like to read controversial literature
[22:59:01] <audrey> Lolita, Marquis de Sade, hell, throw Mein Kampf in there for good measure even though it´s written like garbage
[22:59:06] <audrey> historical importance matters
[22:59:34] <kmh_> sure and at least histrocally interested people should read sources too
[23:00:36] <kmh_> how about rushdie's satanic verses?
[23:01:41] <audrey> Good stuff
[23:01:59] <audrey> Or how about some historically significant films to add to the list
[23:02:07] <audrey> Last Tango in Paris, Last Temptation of Christ, The Exorcist
[23:02:20] <audrey> first one for the extreme sexuality, second two for blasphemy
[23:02:24] <kmh_> more recently though only partially controversial: diary of a call girl
[23:03:17] <kmh_> there most interesting part imho was that for years most people suspected the then anonymous authors to be a british upper class male
[23:04:19] <kmh_> audrey,  as far as banned or controversial films are concerned I like Monty Python's Meaning of Life
[23:04:39] <audrey> I deliberately went through and watched most of the movies on the Catholic Legion of Decency´s «Condemned» list
[23:04:47] <kmh_> or Life of Brian
[23:05:02] <kmh_> they both fall in the blasphemy category mostly
[23:05:25] <audrey> Valley of the Dolls, The Exorcist, Last Picture Show, Rocky Horror Picture Show, Straw Dogs  (that last one is unbelievably grisly and outdoes some violent movies made today)
[23:05:49] <audrey> (but also has some compelling character development and commentary that puts it above the «gore porn» category)
[23:06:07] <audrey> Yes! Gotta love that blasphemy.
[23:06:25] <kmh_> back in highschool it was a common scheme/spoof by students to coax teachers in watching Life of Brian (pretending it's just some "normal" movie about Jesus)
[23:07:16] <audrey> unfortunately these days a lot of movies just have shock value for sake of shock value
[23:07:43] <audrey> it´s no good JUST to be sexually explicit or blasphemous or whatever
[23:07:46] <kmh_> there is also an interesting series of east German movies that got banned in East Germany
[23:07:52] <audrey> there needs to be some serious artistic/creative attempt underneath it
[23:09:45] <kmh_> one, two, three is a good one about the cold war (which for a lomg time was hated by German critics)
[23:10:21] <kmh_> wasn't banned though just trashed when it was first published
[23:10:59] <audrey> The scene in Last Tango where Brando cusses out his mother in law, who wants her daughter to have a Christian burial, is deeply uncomfortable even for me as a non-Christian
[23:11:09] <audrey> he throws a chair against the wall and tells her she´s a moron for believing in God
[23:11:24] <audrey> ... right after her daughter has committed suicide
[23:11:31] <audrey> and yet it´s a very compelling look at male grief
[23:11:34] <kmh_> it is also interesting since the filming itself was interrupted by the cold war (it plays mostly in Berlin and the actuall wall building interrupted the filiming on location)
[23:12:25] <kmh_> audrey, did you see "natural born killers"?
[23:12:45] <kmh_> that was/is rather controversial too when it came out
[23:12:51] <audrey> I haven´t seen that one.
[23:12:56] <audrey> I´ve been meaning to watch American Sniper
[23:13:06] <audrey> I was still in college when the protests started about that movie
[23:13:16] <audrey> they had a picket line in front of the university movie theater and everything
[23:13:23] <audrey> trying to get the uni to stop showing it
[23:13:25] <kmh_> sniper or natural born killers?
[23:13:32] <audrey> American Sniper
[23:13:43] <kmh_> i didn't watch that one
[23:13:46] <audrey> (Then again my alma mater has always leaned heavily toward the social-justice-oriented mentality)
[23:14:30] <kmh_> "natural born killers" is at times like a drug trip through the abyss of the american psyche
[23:14:46] <audrey> How about Easy Rider?
[23:14:52] <kmh_> and imho rather artsy
[23:14:52] <audrey> It´s somehow more problematic today than it was in 1969
[23:15:07] <audrey> despite a much laxer attitude toward sex and drugs
[23:15:44] <kmh_> hmm ijust know that one by reputation and a few clips so far
[23:16:23] <kmh_> but in that context also interesting Harold and Maude
[23:16:38] <kmh_> about "age inappropriate" relations
[23:16:47] <audrey> in fact Easy Rider can be seen as an anti-drug movie
[23:17:00] <audrey> The two main characters live the American dream for a while - flush with cash, riding around the country
[23:17:14] <audrey> and yet they are utterly miserable and empty and end up getting themselves killed
[23:17:16] <kmh_> and end up badly?
[23:17:21] <audrey> Yeah
[23:17:34] <audrey> oh, Henry and June
[23:17:45] <kmh_> thelma and Louise
[23:17:55] <audrey> That one is a little too sexually explicit for me (not enough character conflict going on to outweigh the «boob parade», unlike Last Tango)
[23:19:13] <kmh_> a political one which was sorta banned in the US due to legal fight/military suing was Costa-Gavras' Missing
[23:19:40] <kmh_> iirc it was blocked for decade or so in the US

[23:29:43] <kmh_> audrey,  do you know any of the samzidat literature?
[23:30:56] <audrey> I mean, a fair bit of Solzhenitsyn
[23:31:03] <audrey> Lolita also started out as Western kind of samizdat
[23:31:35] <kmh_> yeah some of the sanzidat got smuggled out and published in the west
[23:31:56] <kmh_> that's some east German authors did to get their stuff published
[23:32:32] <audrey> Oh, We by Evgenij Zamjatin
[23:32:45] <audrey> Interestingly enough it was first published in English, and the Russian version existed as a back translation from English for a while
[23:32:57] <audrey> the Russian original text IIRC was not published until much later
[23:33:13] <audrey> I own a few books from White Russian publishers in the West
[23:34:20] <audrey> History of America (Istorija Ameriki)
[23:34:22] <kmh_> there is Eat German author Stefan Heym who had written some of his material first in English (he fled the nazis to the US and later moved to East Germany)
[23:34:26] <audrey> Undated, but appears to be from late 1920s
[23:35:15] <audrey> Very sparse printing
[23:35:34] <audrey> Oh, my bad, this was printed immediately after the end of WWII
[23:35:41] <audrey> Which explains why they were no longer using the old orthography
[23:35:53] <audrey> Very rare book. I forgot where I got it
[23:36:01] <audrey> oh, this may have been from my ex-fiancée´s collection!
