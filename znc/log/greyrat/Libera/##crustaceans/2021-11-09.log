[00:01:26] <cryptosporidium> i may still continue viewing it that way :)
[00:01:43] <imode> that's hilarious.
[00:02:17] <imode> ..that's even more hilarious considering the bug in question causes the shits.
[00:02:31] <imode> the jokes never end.
[00:03:53] <cryptosporidium> yeah i thought that was the extent of it lol
[00:04:32] <cryptosporidium> apparently it's a real bug; i had heard of other -sporidia, but had no memory of 'cryptosporidium'
[00:04:50] <cryptosporidium> fucking crypto :/

[00:52:26] <ngoldbaum> isn’t it so much better than the built-in ones?
[00:52:43] <ngoldbaum> i still don’t actually know how to use line_profiler from the command line it’s insane
[00:53:00] <Brekkjern> Well, a bit. It doesn't show quite the amount of detail that I would like in the firegraph, but it is very nice to find what method/function is taking up a lot of time
[00:53:07] <ngoldbaum> i guess that’s not built-in but it used to be the state-of-the-art…
[00:53:27] <ngoldbaum> yeah it’s sampling so it’ll only get frames where there are traces
[00:53:35] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[00:54:00] <ngoldbaum> if you’re profiling something really fast i usually put it in a infinite loop or something and kill it with ctrl-C
[00:54:38] <Brekkjern> The issue I originally had was that I was using datastructures that requires hashing of the objects, and I was using them A LOT, so I got clued in on the total time of the hash builtin being a ridiculous number compared to the overall execution time

[17:44:12] <gwozniak> I listened to some podcasts about movies, and season 1 of Serial
[17:45:01] <gwozniak> I also started listening to The History of Rome and A History of Poland, but I did not find either one to be very "binge-ablle", even though they were both interesting

[17:53:23] <gwozniak> I want to listen to the Rome one only because I really don't know that much about the history of Rome
[17:53:32] <dminkovsky> it's great! i would listen to it again...
[17:54:00] <dminkovsky> especially the second half of the podcast when europe starts kind of sort of emerging
[17:54:16] <dminkovsky> well, europe and fuedalism.
[17:54:33] <dminkovsky> the walling in of cities, the enserfment of peoples
[17:55:13] <dminkovsky> i found that i could listen to like 4-5 in a row max
[17:55:25] <dminkovsky> couldn't really binge it more than that before it started running together
[17:55:30] <ngoldbaum> gwozniak: revolutions is better than history of rome imo
[17:56:03] <ngoldbaum> duncan had had a lot more practice making podcasts by the time he started revolutions
[17:56:30] <gwozniak> The beginning of the Rome one definitely feels a bit rough
[17:56:38] <gwozniak> But it wasn't bad
[17:56:40] <gerikson> he's made a long journey
[17:56:46] <gerikson> now he's written 2 damn books
[17:57:14] <gerikson> I was listening to the latest Russian revolution ep when my airpods died
[17:57:22] <gerikson> damn you capitalist economy
[17:57:35] <dminkovsky> i'm at the beginning of WWI and the serbian situation
[17:57:42] <dminkovsky> catching up

[19:09:44] <companion_cube> if you don't pay for horoscopes I guess it's fine
[19:09:50] <companion_cube> it's not a pyramid scheme or anything like that
[19:10:00] <companion_cube> mostly harmless, hopefully
[19:10:20] <gerikson> I figure if you get some sort of positive affirmation every day for I dunno, $5/mo, it's worth as much as a VPS for me for someone

[19:34:10] <indigo> Heh, surprised that the new Dan Luu article didn’t get super upvoted on lobsters
[19:36:25] <indigo> Apparently he has a patreon now with four monthly tiers: $16, $256, $2048, $16384
[19:36:50] <indigo> That’s some expensive writing

[19:37:44] <gerikson> indigo: anything to prevent hims starting a shakeshack!
[19:38:50] <gwozniak> wow - even $16 is an expensive first tier
[19:39:00] <companion_cube> indeed
[19:39:39] <Geekingfrog> I usually enjoy his articles, and there are always interesting links.
[19:39:48] <Geekingfrog> But yes, $16 for first tier is pretty expensive
[19:39:59] <ngoldbaum> indigo: thought leadership as a service
[19:40:15] <companion_cube> maybe we can rewrite danluu in Haskell
[19:40:22] <companion_cube> to provide individualized thought leadership
[19:40:53] <companion_cube> danluu.ai would be a HN-all-time-favorite startup
[19:41:48] <ngoldbaum> one time instead of having a discussion with me when he thought i was wrong about something (whether contributing to open source can help build your resume) he went off in another venue and complained about how obviously the recurse center zulip is going downhill because people are giving dumb advice like contributing to open source can help build your resume
[19:41:52] <ngoldbaum> quite a pleasant guy!
[19:41:57] <indigo> We could train a Markov chain on his text
[19:42:22] <ngoldbaum> eventually he fucked off from the recurse center zulip community, it’s been more pleasant since then
[19:42:52] <indigo> Ah, contributing to open source definitely did not matter for my resume
[19:43:37] <ngoldbaum> it did for me
[19:43:38] <indigo> But then again most companies I applied to tossed my resume in favor of leetcode questions
[19:43:52] <ngoldbaum> almost like there can be multiple valid lived experiences
[19:44:15] <indigo> NO THERE IS ONLY ONE TRUE EXPERIENCE REEEEE
[19:45:09] <Geekingfrog> I think it really depend on the level of automation and outsourcing for hiring.
[19:45:30] <Geekingfrog> If the first filter is keyword based and clueless recruiter and/or leetcode questions, open source isn't very useful
[19:46:06] <Geekingfrog> At my company we have some standardised tests, so even if there are candidates with interesting contribution that could be used for discussion and assessment, it's considered invalid :/
[19:58:26] <indigo> Standardized tests sound interesting. What's the difference between your company's strategy and the usual leetcode whiteboarding questions?
[20:00:30] <Geekingfrog> We do a pairing exercise on some problem which look vaguely similar to something we did a few years ago. I guess the main difference is that they are using their own setup instead of whiteboard?
[20:01:54] <indigo> So basically a real world problem, rather than something more contrived
[20:03:16] <edk> i don't think there's necessarily a ton of difference between "real world problem" and leetcode stuff
[20:03:49] <edk> they are both deeply, fundamentally biased in favour of people who happen to be prepared for them -- they just select for different groups of people
[20:04:42] <Geekingfrog> yup, exactly
[20:05:56] <Geekingfrog> I'm not saying what we're doing is great btw, it's on par with the rest of the industry in my experience.
[20:06:16] <edk> yeah i mean, i think industry practice here tends to suck
[20:06:19] *** Quits: gthm (~gthm@ip-213-127-57-210.ip.prioritytelecom.net) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[20:07:20] <edk> imo the way to test technical aptitude that best factors out the luck element of what the candidate prepared for is to let them take the problem home, give them plenty of time
[20:13:26] <Geekingfrog> In France there's a certain academic cursus where student do basically whiteboard problem solving at least 2h a week for 2 to 3 years. It's ridiculous the advantage it gives when doing whiteboard coding.
[20:14:17] <Geekingfrog> I think my favorite hiring issue is that everyone has the same basic filter, so everyone is competing for the same candidates, while ignoring many more
[20:14:54] <edk> yeah
[20:17:33] <indigo> A leetcode a day keeps unemployment away
[20:18:01] <gwozniak> We have basically eschewed leetcode stuff in our hiring

[21:13:56] <dminkovsky> imode: if you know algos and datastructures don't you know leetcode, though
[21:14:08] <dminkovsky> github just recommended my own repository to me
[21:16:09] <dminkovsky> someone should consider squatting danluu.ai
[21:17:23] <dminkovsky> to what end, i do not know
[21:18:44] <dminkovsky> 2^14 dollars per month is a huge number of dollars per month
[21:19:00] <dminkovsky> i wouldn't have thought danluu had findom aspirations
[21:20:50] <dminkovsky> but i guess everyone is just looking for a sugar daddy
[21:22:37] <imode> dminkovsky: to the extent that you're railroaded through several leetcode questions, knowing the actual backing algorithms and solutions doesn't help much.
[21:23:36] <imode> some of them you can derive without knowing the solution.
[21:23:39] <imode> the others, not so much.
[21:24:01] <imode> that's the problem, you're not really pulling the brain out of your client and setting it on a test bench, you're saying "can you reproduce this output exactly to our criterion".
[21:24:09] <dminkovsky> i thought leetcode was just, like, reverse an array in place
[21:24:22] <imode> oh it has a wonderful gradient.
[21:24:24] <dminkovsky> or, compute fib(n) with such and such optimizations
[21:24:35] <imode> you'd think.
[21:24:54] <dminkovsky> so it's brain teasers you memorize?
[21:24:58] <imode> yyyyup.
[21:25:08] <imode> I had exactly one leetcode question during my Amazon interview and it was something that I actually enjoyed solving. the rest were actual measures of my programming ability.
[21:25:16] <dminkovsky> o_O
[21:25:27] <imode> and systems design capability.
[21:25:34] <dminkovsky> how'd you know it was a leetcode question?
[21:25:45] <imode> because I had seen it before but never solved it.
[21:26:28] <dminkovsky> in general i strongly dislike (hate?) doing puzzles and things of that nature unless it's directly related to something that actually interests me
[21:26:34] <dminkovsky> like, i give no shits about the tower of hanoi
[21:26:36] <imode> same.
[21:26:42] <dminkovsky> cause i'm not building a fucking tower in hanoi
[21:26:48] <dminkovsky> now, if we want to talk about mathematics
[21:26:51] <dminkovsky> that's the best
[21:26:59] <dminkovsky> but random ass puzzles can fuck right off
[21:27:08] <dminkovsky> even if they are related to algorthism
[21:27:18] <dminkovsky> if it's not a systematic study of something, it's trivia and it can fuck off

[21:28:35] <dminkovsky> ps. i'm going to die in the gutter
[21:28:46] <dminkovsky> but i've accepted that i guess

[21:30:44] <imode> oh sweet you can't even view the problem now without an account.
[21:30:46] <imode> fuck that shit.
[21:31:15] <dminkovsky> it's weird you need to keep doing these problems even when you're like 10-15 years into your career
[21:31:34] <dminkovsky> if it was at least like a one or two time thing
[21:31:56] <dminkovsky> welp, people who can do these are definitely smart
[21:32:02] <dminkovsky> i would never argue with that
[21:32:41] <imode> say what you will about triplebyte but they sidestepped a lot of bullshit when I used them.
[21:33:02] <dminkovsky> triplebyte is like leetcode? what do you mean the sidestepped?
[21:33:04] <dminkovsky> they*
[21:33:51] <imode> so, with triplebyte, you take an introductory multiple choice quiz.
[21:34:10] <imode> and depending on how well you do, you either need to take a technical interview with them, or you don't, and you go right into "let's match you to a company" phase.
[21:34:31] <imode> I took it over a lunch break and scored high enough to skip technical interviews.
[21:34:38] <imode> I never had a leetcode interview from that point on.
[21:35:21] <dminkovsky> so you can use this quiz result for any company that uses triplebyte?
[21:35:27] <dminkovsky> and some companies will use triplebyte and leetcode?
[21:35:29] <imode> yup.
[21:37:14] <dminkovsky> shit is crazy
[21:37:23] <dminkovsky> leetcode
[21:37:49] <dminkovsky> they should hire based on looks
[21:38:05] <companion_cube> hire me based on my diplomas, they're worth a lot of leetcode 🤔
[21:38:06] <dminkovsky> and award salaries based on looks as well, for that matter
[21:38:28] <imode> companion_cube: don't do that please, I don't have a degree.
[21:39:04] <companion_cube> sorry, I wasn't serious :D
[21:39:08] <dminkovsky> Cs make degrees, but can you balance trees?
[21:39:09] <companion_cube> although degrees don't hurt.
[21:39:27] <companion_cube> dminkovsky: that's part of CS degrees often no?
[21:39:28] <imode> while I agree, I guarantee I have the equivalent experience.
[21:39:35] <companion_cube> although to remember the exact details is stupid
[21:39:44] <dminkovsky> companion_cube: good looks? rarely
[21:40:06] <companion_cube> no, balancing trees :p
[21:40:19] <dminkovsky> companion_cube: i meant C's, as in the letter grade
[21:40:27] <dminkovsky> "C's make degrees"
[21:40:36] <dminkovsky> it's my motto
[21:40:40] <imode> lolwut.
[21:40:40] <indigo> imode: Interesting; I thought that Triplebyte just gets you past the recruiter screen, and you still have to do leetcode interviews afterward
[21:41:16] <imode> indigo: it's on a per-company basis, yeah, but the initial quiz is a screen enough.
[21:41:38] <imode> it was quality enough to where if I had a company I'd draw from that hiring pool.

[21:43:18] <buttsbot> Twatter - jackshawhan - Help I’ve been giggling about this for an hour. https://t.co/GnmE4gtBiB
[21:43:25] <imode> indigo: hahahaha, no way.
[21:43:29] <imode> the quiz is actually stupidly easy.
[21:44:22] <defect> honestly, i suspect that at this point leetcode-type interview questions is mostly to a) weed out people who just can't code, and b) measure the motivation of the candidate
[21:45:00] <imode> they'd weed me out, and I guarantee I can code, and am heavily motivated.
[21:45:36] <dminkovsky> I guarantee I can code, and am heavily motivated.
[21:45:38] <defect> no, i mean, yesterday i had a phone screen (i did the systems part) and in the coding the candidate struggled with for loop and said his O(n^2) solution was linear
[21:45:58] <ngoldbaum> defect: it’s a cheap/easy way of making sure a candidate has soon undergrad CS material
[21:46:06] <dminkovsky> so that's "a)"
[21:46:09] <ngoldbaum> even if undergrad CS material isn’t necessary for the job
[21:46:09] <defect> yeah
[21:46:11] <dminkovsky> that person can't code
[21:46:38] <dminkovsky> and i'm not saying people who do leetcode have no sense respect; they rightfully want a salar and stability and are willing to play the game of getting that
[21:46:42] <kline> ngoldbaum, that tweet is disgusting, i love it
[21:46:51] <dminkovsky> but for me, personally, leetcode is a vioation of personal dignity
[21:46:53] <companion_cube> defect: curious, was it properly on the phone, or a video chat?
[21:46:55] <dminkovsky> i can't do it
[21:47:03] <imode> also define "struggled with for loop".
[21:47:11] <companion_cube> imode: struggled at every step
[21:47:15] <defect> companion_cube: video chat
[21:47:16] <companion_cube> from 1 to 10
[21:47:22] <imode> I can't tell- yeah that was a pun lmao.
[21:47:23] <riv> Any time I think "people aren't actually that stupid" i get proven wrong
[21:47:29] <companion_cube> defect: ah, good. I'd hate to be forced to use a phone
[21:47:31] <riv> (re. the NFT thing)
[21:47:44] <indigo> I had a candidate that got frustrated with me once... he said that sometimes checking to see an element's existence in an array is faster than in a hashset
[21:48:11] <imode> I mean he's not wrong. provided it's at element 0.
[21:48:13] <indigo> Years later, I now realize that he was correct :-)
[21:48:30] <imode> or something nearby. or it's close to the start point of whatever search algorithm.
[21:48:32] <companion_cube> indeed
[21:48:51] <companion_cube> imode: it can be faster up to dozens or hundreds of elements, depending
[21:48:56] <imode> yeh.
[21:49:02] <ngoldbaum> imode: or the first few if they’re in L1 cache in e.g. C or something that generstes machine code
[21:49:11] <indigo> +1 arrays have better cache locality
[21:49:14] <imode> yeah memory locality is an easy way to beat that.
[21:49:32] <ngoldbaum> every HashMap query is a chache miss
[21:49:32] <imode> I love how y'all come out of the woodwork and display those badges of personal learning.
[21:49:39] <imode> good on you.
[21:50:05] <indigo> Time to write a thought leader blog post
[21:50:08] <indigo> "The low ego programmer"
[21:50:12] <imode> now you're gonna die.
[21:50:16] <ngoldbaum> $16 please
[21:50:21] <ngoldbaum> or some power thereof
[21:50:45] <indigo> ngoldbaum: Sorry, can I pay in RC zulip points instead
[21:51:03] <companion_cube> imode: am I hired now?
[21:51:06] <gwozniak> ngoldbaum: wait.. that's how NFTs work?!?!
[21:51:18] <imode> gwozniak: tell me you're joking.
[21:51:24] <imode> please.
[21:51:31] <gwozniak> I'm refering to the twitter link he posted earlier
[21:51:33] <imode> companion_cube: you were hired before you stepped in the door bb
[21:51:39] <ngoldbaum> but the receipt isn’t fungible and that’s the important part
[21:51:49] <gwozniak> imode: so yes, joking :)
[21:51:54] <imode> thank god.
[21:52:06] <dminkovsky> i'm not believing these tweets are real
[21:52:13] <indigo> Broke: NFTs Woke: shares in multi-million dollar paintings (https://www.masterworks.io/)

[21:52:14] <buttsbot> Masterworks - Learn to Invest in Fine Art
[21:52:21] <companion_cube> imode: thank fuck
[21:52:21] <dminkovsky> this idiocy generally does exist for sure, but it doesn't play out like this
[21:52:32] <companion_cube> cause I stepped in the door in my pyjamas
[21:52:40] <imode> I'd hire a motherfucker in their pajamas.
[21:52:47] <companion_cube> technically all of that!
[21:52:47] <imode> you know how to work comfy.
[21:52:50] <dminkovsky> weird that the stock market doesn't provide ppl with enough absurd opporutnity to speculate
[21:52:55] <dminkovsky> that they've moved into NFTs
[21:53:00] <imode> dminkovsky: it's money laundering.
[21:53:01] <riv> https://twitter.com/tropoFarmer/status/1458081074685177856
[21:53:01] <buttsbot> Twitter - tropoFarmer - trolling normies = engagement cheat code https://t.co/wkdE8Wh9uX
[21:53:05] <dminkovsky> gambling has been leglalized
[21:53:12] <dminkovsky> imode: i guess that's a part of it
[21:53:16] <imode> like genuinely as someone who has some.. inside knowledge on some of this NFT shit, it's money laundering.
[21:53:24] <imode> communal money laundering.
[21:53:29] <dminkovsky> you own NFTs imode ?
[21:53:36] <imode> no, but I was contracted to build a couple marketplaces.
[21:53:36] <defect> heh, people found trading away their retirements on options on robinhood wasn't enough
[21:53:44] <dminkovsky> i see
[21:53:51] <dminkovsky> defect: that's what i'm saying
[21:53:53] <imode> specifically in places like turkey.
[21:53:56] <imode> saudis love NFTs.
[21:53:58] <dminkovsky> how is this even encessary
[21:54:08] <dminkovsky> ppl, man
[21:54:18] * dminkovsky gets back to work, fuck everything 
[21:54:25] <imode> it's necessary because you need a large network to do untraceable business, and the more frontends to that network you spin up, the harder things are to trace.
[21:54:44] <riv> for the sake of the planet I think we should just make a way for people to do money laundering without a blockchain involved
[21:54:49] <riv> like some kind of amnesty
[21:54:59] <companion_cube> :D
[21:54:59] <imode> how about we fuckin' eat the rich.
[21:55:03] <ngoldbaum> riv: “i’m not owned! i’m not owned!”
[21:55:12] <riv> hell yeah
[21:55:14] <companion_cube> imode: you don't know where they've been, could be unsanitary
[21:55:21] <imode> I will risk the botulism.
[21:55:48] <edk> i'm on board with eating the rich, in general, but curious how many people in this channel would not be considered "rich" by someone on a median income
[21:56:02] <riv> start with billionares
[21:56:07] <riv> any billionares in this chat rn
[21:56:07] <imode> yeah, we'll work out way down.
[21:56:09] <indigo> Dan Luu has 83 patrons; so theoretically after all the fees, he's probably earning around ~$1.2k (low bound). Not a bad haul.
[21:56:10] <imode> *our way down
[21:56:17] <companion_cube> you're not rich if you can't buy a yacht purely on non-salary income
[21:56:26] <indigo> Sounds like the programming blog market is lucrative
[21:56:38] <ngoldbaum> rich is relative
[21:57:17] <edk> yeah
[21:58:00] <ngoldbaum> those poor manhattanites struggling on $400k/yr household income
[21:58:21] <imode> I make enough for two households at $60k/yr/household. I don't consider me rich because if anything were to fall out of balance, bad things happen.
[21:58:39] <imode> jeff bezos has more money than god.
[21:59:08] <imode> he can create 50 of me in an incubator, pay them all half a million dollars and still not feel a dent.
[21:59:17] <imode> that's rich.
[21:59:18] <edk> the point is i think the point at which people in the same wealth/income bracket consider each other "rich" is probably magnitudes higher than where a panel of people on median incomes would consider "rich" to start
[21:59:42] <edk> we can all agree that billionaires are filthy rich, i'm sure most of them consider themselves rich too
[21:59:52] <imode> then let's eat the filthy rich.
[22:00:09] <imode> bring your hand sanitizer.
[22:00:48] <ngoldbaum> lmao this just got promoted in my feed https://twitter.com/intel/status/1453457989176791044
[22:00:48] <buttsbot> Twatter - intel - Moore's law is alive! @Intel just entered the Angstrom Era, and we’re not done until the periodic table is exhausted. We’ll be re...
[22:01:00] * ngoldbaum thinks an exponential is a poor fit on the high end
[22:01:13] <ngoldbaum> perhaps a logistic function is a more realistic model?
[22:01:28] <imode> someone wanted to get paid.
[22:02:10] <edk> but there's a much larger field which probably contains a lot of tech workers where they don't consider themselves to be rich but earn several times more than the median
[22:02:27] <riv> you do realize intel will go to jail if they break moores law?
[22:02:33] <edk> i'm not sure i know a reason why, morally, we should not be eaten
[22:02:40] <companion_cube> their electrons will jailbreak, riv
[22:02:44] <companion_cube> by quantum tunnel effect

[22:04:24] <defect> + spectre
[22:38:03] <edm> i saw the new bond last night
[22:38:08] <edm> i was quite dissapointed
[22:38:51] <imode> is this the end of that particular bond timeline.
[22:38:59] <edm> yes
[22:39:10] <imode> was it a fitting end.
[22:39:25] <edm> not especially
[22:39:38] <companion_cube> for a second I thought it was about finance bonds
[22:39:47] <gwozniak> I didn't mind it.  Wasn't great, but I enjoyed it for what it was.
[22:39:54] <edm> i started off enjoying it
[22:40:14] <edm> and then about 2/3 of the way through i caught myself thinking about work and christmas lists and so on
[22:40:21] * ngoldbaum waits for idris elba to be the next one
[22:40:29] <edm> i had no idea really why the baddy was bad and why he had such a baddy lair
[22:40:42] <ngoldbaum> casino royale is the only good daniel craig movie
[22:40:52] <edm> it jst seemed to be assembled from bits of old bonds
[22:40:58] <ngoldbaum> err, bond movie, he was good in knives out too
[22:41:04] <edm> all sort of reheated together into more bond
[22:41:14] <companion_cube> ngoldbaum: could be a black lesbian
[22:41:20] <companion_cube> to change a bit more
[22:41:31] <companion_cube> or, since it's british, an indian lady :D
[22:41:40] <edm> talking slowly with a funny accent and facial disfigurements <- the brief for playing a bond villain
[22:41:44] <ngoldbaum> suddenly it’s a bollywood thriller
[22:42:30] <companion_cube> a dance contest would beat the  classic casino  scene imho
[22:44:02] <edm> basically it was just a bit meh. i think i may rewatch GoldFinger or something
[22:44:17] <edm> it's obviously silly too but the silliness seems more acceptable in its 60s context
[22:44:58] <edm> when knowing about cocktails and caviar and champagne was very cosmopolitan and impressive
[22:49:56] <dminkovsky> damn are my social skills antequated
[22:49:56] <gwozniak> edm: yes, the villan was the weakest part of the movie
[22:50:19] <gwozniak> Which, strangely, didn't bother me terribly
[22:50:22] <edm> yes it just seemed a bit perfunctory didn't it
[22:50:52] <edm> just feed all the old ones into an AI and out pops malek
[22:52:11] <ngoldbaum> i didn’t like him much in mr robot either
[22:52:45] <edm> i think he's a fine actor infact, but he didn't really have to do anything here, as i mentioned
[22:52:55] <edm> just speak slowly and softly in generic foreign accent
[22:53:05] <edm> after 3 hrs of facial disfigurement makeup
[22:53:16] <edm> i could have done it i suspect
[22:53:18] <gwozniak> I have nothing against him, but I wasn't totally awed by Bohemian Rhapsody either
[22:53:22] <edm> and i can't act
[22:56:19] <edm> narcos is back tho, which is good, some well written grit
[22:56:52] <imode> is it?!
[22:56:53] <imode> damn.
[22:57:03] <imode> I loved that series.
[22:57:45] <edm> yes
[22:57:46] <edm> mexico
[22:57:49] <edm> a few days ago
[23:00:31] <edm> and i am building up to getting apple tv to give Foundation a try, I've heard it's good
[23:07:58] <imode> Foundation... Asimov?
[23:08:27] <imode> oh god.
[23:12:11] <edm> imode: yep
[23:15:31] <gerikson> halfway through novel #2
[23:15:38] <gerikson> there's very little real action
[23:16:19] <gwozniak> I'm watching the series and have not read the books.  I'm enjoying the series, despite it being a tad confusing and frustrating at times
[23:17:58] <gerikson> the books are... not good
[23:18:12] <gerikson> I mean apart from the obvious anachronisms
[23:18:21] <gerikson> like the fact evreryone smokes
[23:21:23] <edm> maybe that coes back in the future
[23:21:31] <edm> i'd love to smoke if it had no side effects
[23:21:35] <edm> a pipe, i think
[23:21:45] <edm> good for pointing at schematics

[23:38:13] <Brekkjern> It fascinates me that the Reddit thread about that "This will only take 2 hours" thread is so much better than the Lobste.rs one.
[23:38:26] <Brekkjern> The site all missed the point by a mile
[23:38:32] <Brekkjern> Probably because they are all 10x devs

[23:40:19] <Brekkjern> No point in bragging/making yourself seem more awesome when your reddit handle is NekkidApe
[23:47:45] <edk> i think there's a significant element of just, you know, selecting for different kinds of people
[23:48:01] <edk> there are some people who get the point on the lobsters thread
[23:48:35] <Brekkjern> Yeah, but that's kind of my point. That is the selection in effect
[23:49:12] <Brekkjern> What's the point of being on "the elite website where all the awesome devs are if you can't benefit from it"
[23:52:20] <edk> well, for a lot of people it's just to have somewhere to talk about tech stuff
