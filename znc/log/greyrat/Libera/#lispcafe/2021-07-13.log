[14:09:37] *** Joins: selwyn (~selwyn@user/selwyn)
[14:10:45] <hayley> Still, what do you say to my conjecture that we only ever really need to duplicate (if tags only exist once already) when we have something of the form (A*)B?
[14:12:26] *** Joins: selwyn_ (~selwyn@user/selwyn)
[14:12:44] <gilberth> What about (a + aa)[t](a + aa)?
[14:12:47] <hayley> That is the only time the rule for derivative of concatenation ends up including B and the derivative of B in the produced RE (without one or the other obviously being simplified out).
[14:13:11] <hayley> Hm.
[14:15:09] *** Quits: selwyn (~selwyn@user/selwyn) (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
[14:17:25] <hayley> Second attempt: we only duplicate when for some AB, (nullable A) is not the empty set but yet its derivative is not the empty string?
[14:21:50] <hayley> AFAICT that is the only time A and B are duplicated for any RE.
[14:23:07] <gilberth> Yes. And when \nu(A) = null, then there are no register in there in the first place.
[14:23:12] *** Quits: pjb (~pjb@user/pjb) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[14:23:21] <gilberth> But: I don't duplicate, I rename.
[14:23:48] <hayley> Call it what you want.
[14:25:02] <hayley> Still, while it won't give you anything like END ← START + n, I think that rule is enough of data "flow" analysis to drive an interpreter efficiently.
[14:25:29] <hayley> Rather than starting each replica number at 0, keep counting from 0 and you have register numbers.
[14:26:05] <gilberth> But you're right. This the derivative of the concatenation, which may yield two different versions of a tag. When \nu(A) = null the LHS of \delta(rs) = \nu(r)\delta(s) + \delta(r)s ceases to exist => No duplication possible.
[14:28:41] <gilberth> Still I don't get what your "problem" is.
[14:28:53] <hayley> OTOH you want to track register number liveness so that you can decide when you can reuse register numbers.
[14:29:46] <hayley> The problem is I am too lazy to do a data flow analysis pass, and in an interpreter we may not be able to do global analysis, so this will suffice.
[14:34:29] <gilberth> Well, this depends on how you pick a register for an actual assignment. You could pick any name, which is not present in the RE at hand. Also: My proof that this terminates at all uses the fact, that |D_*| is finite => Only a finite number of registers needed at all. It's only formulated in this lazy way as to pick the smallest k, so that t_i^k does not appear.
[14:35:03] <gilberth> Could as well have been: Pick some register r_j, so that j is the smallest index, that r_j does not appear => Reuse.
[14:35:17] <hayley> Right.
[14:36:32] <gilberth> But you still get renaming in what you call unification.
[14:36:37] <hayley> For fuck's sake, I need to fill out a form to get my grades adjusted.
[14:37:46] <gilberth> A form? And I always thought German were world leaders in bureaucracy.
[14:38:02] <hayley> It is a unification problem, no? Have two trees, pick a variable -> variable mapping so that they match up.
[14:39:10] <hayley> "For example, teamwork must be evidenced." How the fuck do I show evidence of the lack of teamwork? That the response to my messages only came days later I guess?
[14:41:17] <gilberth> Wait a second, I pick new registers right in NULLABLE. At a time I do not yet know, what others will die off during the process. So one idea to reduce register renaming in the first place could be to do register assigment for new assignments after you have the whole new derivative. Place a token THIS-IS-A-NEW-REGISTER while computing the derivative and only after done find good guesses which to actually use.
[14:42:13] <hayley> Sure.
[14:43:31] <hayley> Still, how do I suggest how I'd be marked in spite of them lying about what software to use? Just bump up every section that says "Don't know, couldn't compile it"?
[14:43:32] <gilberth> This should get your linear reassignments of t_i^j <- t_i^k in loops. Or most of them. t_i^j dropped, another t_i^k needed, reuse the former. Hmm.
[14:45:03] <gilberth> I kind of rely on copy propagation to catch this way later.
