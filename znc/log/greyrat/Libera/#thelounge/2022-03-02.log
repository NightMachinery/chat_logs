[00:10:42] <misterpickles> hello, i got a public instance going , but i have users that arent really tech savvy and id like to hide the options for username, real name, and quit message
[00:10:50] <misterpickles>  i found this stuff in 3 places 
[00:11:14] <misterpickles> and im not sure which one affects the connect preferences page
[00:11:23] <xnaas> The easiest solution would be to make a custom theme that hides those and set it as the default theme (you could just fork one of the built-in themes).
[00:11:27] <misterpickles> i went as far as renaming all 3 files and it was the same
[00:11:29] <misterpickles> ok
[00:11:38] <misterpickles> so its in a theme
[00:11:45] <misterpickles> got it thats a good start ty
[00:11:51] <xnaas> Otherwise you need to get into editing the source code and building The Lounge yourself
[00:11:55] <xnaas> which is a bit much haha

[00:12:23] <misterpickles> wheres this default theme located
[00:12:41] <misterpickles> debian package
[00:13:01] <xnaas> Probably https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/tree/master/client/css ?
[00:13:14] * xnaas hasn't personally gone this route in the past.
[00:14:07] <xnaas> https://thelounge.chat/docs/guides/theme-creation is one option

[00:21:36] <misterpickles> somewhere in there
[00:21:50] <misterpickles> ok how about an easier question
[00:21:59] <misterpickles> is there a URL parameter for public mode
[00:22:04] <misterpickles> to join a channel
[00:22:18] <misterpickles>  like /?#thelounge
[00:22:30] <misterpickles>  or /?#amys_room

[00:22:43] <xnaas> https://thelounge.chat/docs/guides/network-overrides
[00:24:05] <misterpickles> perfect sorry for lazy questions our main server completely died 3 days ago and ive been at it 3 days
[00:24:16] <misterpickles> i have a very heavily customized kiwi
[00:24:25] <misterpickles> and im gonna test/offer/try thelounge
[00:24:41] <misterpickles> normally i go into all of this, im just exhausted
[00:24:46] <misterpickles> ty for the tips again xnaas
[00:24:48] <xnaas> I've actually been running into an issue hosting a public lounge that I can't troubleshoot and was looking at other stuff haha
[00:24:53] <misterpickles> you helped last time too
[00:25:02] <xnaas> It's a fault of either caddy or cloudflare, though, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[00:25:10] <misterpickles> whats the issue
[00:25:16] <misterpickles> is it with webirc ?
[00:25:21] <xnaas> nah
[00:25:29] <xnaas> just people's tcp connections are closing and they're getting booted
[00:25:32] <xnaas> but I can't replicate it
[00:25:40] <misterpickles> thats cloudflare man
[00:25:42] <xnaas> doesn't matter if the timeouts are set to 12h+
[00:25:47] <misterpickles> they have a very short ssl session length
[00:26:08] <xnaas> but even going through Tor (so I'm off LAN), I'm not running into the issue like other people are lol
[00:26:13] <xnaas> so I've got no clue
[00:26:14] <misterpickles> im forced to ah, provide an SSL certificate and take my connections directly like kiwi
[00:26:23] <misterpickles> we tried this through cloudflare
[00:26:36] <misterpickles> and it kicks a lot of people off after  a brief time idle
[00:26:58] <xnaas> What's odd is it worked fine for eons through nginx
[00:27:05] <misterpickles> im testing this through cloudflare but mark my words, i will buy an ssl certificate when im happy with it
[00:27:10] <xnaas> but it doesn't seem like caddy is to blame, so
[00:27:31] <misterpickles> no cloudflare absolutely has an ssl session limit
[00:27:36] <misterpickles> i forgot how long
[00:27:39] <xnaas> The only other thing that changed in recent history was turning off some 0-RTT reconnection shit that fixed a long-time Plex issue I was having
[00:27:55] <xnaas> (on cloudflare0
[00:27:56] *** mavericks11 is now known as mavericks
[00:27:58] <xnaas> s/0/)
[00:28:19] <xnaas> but dunno, maybe I was just lucky before and had a longer legacy setting secretly applied to my account or something lol
[00:28:28] <misterpickles> its been 2-3 years since i had to deal with that. we were hoping to get out of paying for an ssl certificate
[00:28:35] <xnaas> just use LE?
[00:28:40] <misterpickles> LE?
[00:28:44] <xnaas> Let's Encrypt
[00:28:45] <misterpickles> oh
[00:28:55] <misterpickles> i have before
[00:28:59] <misterpickles> we use ssl.com rn
[00:29:04] <misterpickles> and its paid for 5 years
[00:29:18] <xnaas> I have 100% valid LE certs, but Cloudflare is still my MITM because it helps with so much stuff ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[00:30:15] <xnaas> (though neither my irc or mumble servers are or can be through cloudflare, so they advertise my LE certs! \o/)
[00:30:22] <misterpickles> yep they terminate irc sessions
[00:30:25] <misterpickles> can confirm
[00:30:36] <xnaas> they want you to pay for Spectrum :P
[00:30:38] <misterpickles> cloudflare specific peeve
[00:30:39] <xnaas> I get it
[00:30:40] <xnaas> gotta make money
[00:30:42] <misterpickles> ya
[00:31:12] <misterpickles> im cutting over to thelounge as soon as i get rid of these damn dialog boxes
[00:31:18] <xnaas> haha
[00:31:30] <xnaas> I feel ya. I should get around to hiding some of those fields some time
[00:31:34] <xnaas> I only ever get confused users
[00:31:38] <xnaas> b/c no one uses IRC any more

[00:33:00] <xnaas> ✅
[00:33:25] <xnaas> yeah, I don't need any field other than nick, tbh
[00:33:30] <shadoozo> wouldn't private mode make sense if you have the same group of people connecting?
[00:33:45] <xnaas> That's what my private instance is for. I have randoms pass by, though. :P
[00:33:52] <shadoozo> ah ye
[00:34:09] <xnaas> I've had people ask me random questions about nitter (I host a nitter instance) and such ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[00:34:21] <misterpickles> i want private mode but i cant get an ldap going with anope
[00:34:24] <xnaas> though kinda hard for people to now, since connections keep randomly dying...
[00:34:33] <misterpickles> so that people can register with nickserv and just HAVE a lounge account
[00:34:51] <xnaas> that'd be kewl, yah
[00:35:09] <shadoozo> yeee
[00:35:12] <shadoozo> I never got to that
[00:35:22] <misterpickles> it should work but openldap wont let me create a schema for anope
[00:35:28] <misterpickles> and anope wont tell me how
[00:35:34] <misterpickles> pulled my hair out for 3 days
[00:35:45] <shadoozo> but I only had to deal with 35 users, and since it was mostly one time setup I didn't care that much :P
[00:36:05] <misterpickles> im about to just hack anope, to manually create their damn account from the CLI when they register
[00:36:16] <misterpickles> for thelounge
[00:36:35] <xnaas> Dealing with services was such a nightmare, I never bothered setting up an irc server and just used Leenode

[01:17:54] <misterpickles> yes we have inconsistent behavior too
[01:17:59] <misterpickles> are they ipv6, ipv4
[01:18:05] <misterpickles> look at things like that
[01:18:11] <misterpickles> i never get kicked off either
[01:18:13] <xnaas> This connection is IPv6 (I have no IPv6 at home, but thank Tor)
[01:18:15] <misterpickles> ill sit there 24 hours
[01:18:29] <misterpickles> but other people get kicked off after 180 secs
[01:18:34] <misterpickles> i have no clue why
[01:18:49] <xnaas> yeah; it's wild
[01:19:02] <xnaas> I suppose we should go #thelounge-offtopic at this point, though

[02:33:56] <misterpickles> i did edit it correcly

[02:34:23] <misterpickles> and shows an error in firefox debug 
[02:34:28] <misterpickles> for 404
[02:34:50] <misterpickles> but if i make an ssh tunnel to local port 9000 to thelounge on 9000
[02:34:53] <misterpickles> my edit worked
[02:35:07] <misterpickles> so i can probably copy that file somewhere
[02:35:11] <misterpickles> and force a remap
[02:36:18] <bookworm> you're not listening, are you... You should not edit the bundle file directly 
[02:37:13] <bookworm> if you don't, the app will reload and happily do the right thing, but for that you need to modify the code, build, deploy that and then restart TL
[02:37:50] <bookworm> considering your very limited usecase, just use CSS as you've already been told twice 
[02:40:45] <misterpickles> well,  seeing that im being thrown to the wolves and told it to figure it out myself

[05:16:15] <acidsys> hi, on a prive thelounge instance certfp works fine with all IRC networks, except our own, hosted on the same machine as thelounge. the user is connected without the certificate being presented to the server. the TLS requirement should be satisfied, as the network is connected over TLS. does someone happen to have an idea what else it could be?

[11:02:41] <enyc> I'm virtually sure if you put up such a page in the docs and then point libera staff at it they can get it added to the SASL-setup list on the helpful libera guides

[13:27:11] <Visor> Is there a way to silence the insecure connection warning when using self signed certs? I've got the lounge and ZNC in docker. ZNC has a self signed cert. I could add my root cert to my linux box but I was wondering if the lounge has somer other mechanism for this like trusting a cert?
[13:27:43] <bookworm> not yet no. You can hide the warning with CSS
[13:28:01] <bookworm> else adding it to the system CA store is the best way to go
[13:28:18] <bookworm> cert pinning is an open issue iirc

[13:28:47] <Visor> Nice. Ill have a think about adding it to the CA. Ive been hesitant for some reason but maybe its not a worry

[19:25:54] <SSLbits> is chat history supposed to survive across reboots of the host? 
[19:26:30] <xnaas> If you use sqlite logs in private mode, they do, yes.
[19:26:36] <SSLbits> i originally copied all of my configuration files from another host and had to chown permissions on the new box, but i'm wondering if i'm missing anything

[20:19:09] <chir4gm8> I get a 502 bad gateway

[20:19:40] <chir4gm8> but it is empty
[20:20:15] <bookworm> when you try locally, is TL functional?
[20:20:32] <bookworm> as in, does it work of you remove the proxy from the mix?

[20:28:32] <bookworm> meaning TL is working and your problem is the nginx config

[20:30:24] <chir4gm8> i guess so. but isn't nginx complaining about upstream?

[20:30:47] <bookworm> it is

[20:35:06] <bookworm> you can try pasting a link to a pastebin of your full nginx config in here, rather than a partial snippet

[20:37:16] <chir4gm8> really? how does 'caddy' compare to nginx
