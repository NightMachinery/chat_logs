[00:51:25] <gajus> [[ -z "$1" ]] && { echo "Parameter 1 is empty" ; exit 1; }

[00:52:19] <geirha> [[ $1 ]] || { printf >&2 'Parameter 1 is empty\n' ; exit 1 ; }   is how I'd write it
[00:52:36] <twkm> i'd use if.
[00:53:12] <geirha> briefest would be something like  : "${1:?Parameter 1 is empty}"

[01:01:11] <yates`> i'm looking at this case statement in a bash file: http://paste.debian.net/1222645/
[01:02:34] <yates`> if i understand correctly lines 9, 16, 23, and 30 all will define their section of variables if the original $INF_VARIANT is blank. and i presume the first one (line 9) will take precedence.
[01:03:14] <yates`> so why would the designer of this case statement have multiple "x" definitions?
[01:04:03] <twkm> wag: changing notion of what should be the default, stuffed in above the others but failing to clean-up.
[01:04:33] <yates`> twkm: yeah, i thought of that. basically, just being lazy?
[01:05:19] <yates`> there is no weird "bash does this in case of this and this and they moon is full" exception i take it.

[05:18:36] <wstrnr> by the way, at 13 Apr 1994 Richard Stallman sent a letter that went viral in all of the GNU world:
[05:18:40] <wstrnr> Subject: A reminder: no pathnames in GNU
[05:18:40] <wstrnr> It's a GNU convention to use the term "file name" for the name of a file, never "pathname".  We use the term "path" for search paths, which are lists of file names.  Using it for a single file name as well is potentially confusing to users.
[05:18:40] <wstrnr> So please check any documentation you maintain, if you think you might have used "pathname".  Note that "file name" should be two words when it appears as ordinary text.  It's ok as one word when it's a metasyntactic variable, though.

I tend to use filepath more in cases in which I know a regular file is there, rather than a dir or "other". Correct me if I am wrong

[05:29:32] <Blondie101010> so GNU controls the vocabulary laws now?
[05:29:41] <Blondie101010> come on
[05:31:06] <Blondie101010> choosing the right term to get understood by most readers is not that easy
[05:32:55] <Blondie101010> I don't like "pathname", but it tends to be efficient to express the fully qualified file name
[05:33:34] <maroloccio> I dislike this kind of controls generally but.. he seems to have a point. If PATH is something specific and then "path" again is something else in another context.. I just did not understand if the suggestion was to call my.docx a "filename"  but also a "filename" something like /foo/bar/baz.quux
[05:33:59] <Blondie101010> "PATH" was chosen based on the word's meaning
[05:34:19] <Blondie101010> it represents the path chosen
[05:34:33] <Blondie101010> it's a list of paths
[05:34:59] <Blondie101010> definitely not conflicting with itself

[05:35:58] <wstrnr> /a/b/c - filename
[05:36:26] <Blondie101010> usually 'file name' refers to `basename $pathname`
[05:36:27] <wstrnr> /a/b - directory filename or directory name or just phrase it as usual, name of directory
[05:36:41] <wstrnr> c - filename too, a relative filename,
[05:37:10] <maroloccio> Oh, so filename stays filename but "relative" becomes "understood/unspoken"
[05:37:23] <maroloccio> wstrnr: thanks. link to source?
[05:37:24] <Blondie101010> so we agree that it can easily be confusing
[05:37:40] <Blondie101010> file name is too imprecise alone
[05:37:43] <maroloccio> Blondie101010: I found your definition above slightly circular
[05:38:03] <wstrnr> the idea that real world words should be used in computer world, like "path", "bug", "toolkit" is widely criticized among people who like to criticize things, Dijkstra wrote an angry article about it once, "The Bane of Teaching Computer Science" it was called (or something like that)
[05:38:05] <Blondie101010> $PATH is a list of paths to choose from in sequencew

[08:31:31] <gajus> What would be a safe way to accept a multi-line string if a variable is interpolated before reaching bash?
[08:31:50] <gajus> The context is a YAML file that includes bash commands and variables that are expanded before it reaches batch, e.g.
[08:31:52] <gajus> run: echo "${{ inputs.application_manifest }}"
[08:32:12] <gajus> that `${{ inputs.application_manifest }}` will be replaced with a multi-line string, which currently breaks echo
[08:32:30] <pj> first off, use printf, not echo
[08:33:55] <gajus> for what it is worth, I need to store this value into a file
[08:34:15] <pj> so how is the string getting interpolated?
[08:34:34] <gajus> whatever templating language that my CI/CD is using
[08:34:57] <pj> I would probably do something like this...
[08:35:46] <pj> cat > filename <<'ABCDEFBLAH'
[08:35:52] <pj> ${{ inputs.application_manifest }}
[08:35:56] <pj> ABCDEFBLAH
[08:36:49] <pj> You can use any string in place of ABCDEFBLAH, just make sure you use something that won't be in the content.
[08:37:33] <gajus> Thank you

[17:30:44] <Soliton> the data IS on stdin. why do you need a pipe?
[17:31:00] <Soliton> even then there is no reason you need to leave the subshell before you're done.
[17:32:20] <DPA> Just look at how many places I need $map. A pipe can only be consumed once. Sure, there may be ways to do this somehow, but it will make the code much more complicated and harder to read.
[17:32:55] <Soliton> harder to read?? wow. it's unreadable now. literally impossible to tell what it does.
[17:33:24] <tirnanog> flower_: I tinkered with this approach and found that a) xdg-open may invoke gio open, as it does in my case b) without a subsequent sleep, gio open does not carry out its duty. it may be that the component responsible for launching the desktop entry kills off the sub-processes somehow.

[22:33:11] <cousteau> However the first iteration inherits the outer value for the variable, as if it had been exported
[22:33:28] <emanuele6> not as if it had been exported
[22:33:39] <Soliton> subshells inherit all variables.

[23:03:39] <cousteau> I want to print a final message stating whether there were any errors or if all files succeeded
[23:03:40] <emanuele6> so you are iterating newline delimited files?
[23:03:47] *** Joins: n4dir (~user@i5E86C54F.versanet.de)
[23:03:47] <emanuele6> that is not great
[23:04:02] <cousteau> Well, I'm iterating the output of find
[23:04:10] <emanuele6> yeah, that is not a good idea
[23:04:25] <emanuele6> filenames can contain newlines
[23:04:25] <cousteau> This directory doesn't contain files whose name contains a newline
[23:04:36] <cousteau> Yeah I thought of that
[23:04:49] <cousteau> But, well, sort of ignored the possibility
[23:05:17] *** Quits: tsujp (~tsujp@sourcehut/user/tsujp) (Quit: Client closed)

[23:05:57] <cousteau> ...look, most of the scripts I work with will just break if a directory contains spaces; the code I write is amazing compared to that.
[23:05:59] <emanuele6> but are you sure you need find and a glob would not be enough?
[23:07:00] <cousteau> I'm finding symlinks

[23:07:09] <cousteau> Recursively
[23:08:39] <cousteau> I guess I could do `for filename in **; do if [ file is not a link ]; then continue; fi; ... `
[23:08:46] <emanuele6> that is bash syntax
[23:08:55] <cousteau> Yeah I'm aware :(
[23:09:07] <hejux> cousteau: subshell, subshell, subshell. repeat 3 times.
[23:09:26] <cousteau> for filename in * */* */*/* */*/*/* */*/*/*/*; do
[23:09:45] <emanuele6> cousteau: anyway, if you want to just check for an error, you can simply make the pipe fail
[23:09:58] <emanuele6> and check the exit status of the pipeline
[23:10:20] <cousteau> emanuele6: well yeah but if there's an error I want to continue with the next file, not exit immediately
[23:10:29] <emanuele6> so what?
[23:11:00] <cousteau> So what were you suggesting?
[23:12:03] <emanuele6> find ... ! -name "*$nl*" | { e=0; while IFS= read -r file; do do_thing "$file" || e=1; done; exit "$e" ;}
[23:12:48] <emanuele6> and then: if that_stuff_above_here; then echo error occured; fi
[23:13:03] <cousteau> Well, that uses { } and an internal variable.  I thought you were suggesting an alternative that wouldn't use those.

[23:15:41] <emanuele6> what do you want if an error is detected?
[23:16:09] <emanuele6> i suggested you that solution, because if you want to stop the main script if an error occurred you can't do it from the subshell

[23:16:42] <cousteau> I just saw -d.  It doesn't say anything about -d "" being valid, but anyone knowing how C strings work might suspect that'd work
[23:16:55] <cousteau> emanuele6: on error I'll just print a message at the end
[23:17:03] <emanuele6> then just use {}
