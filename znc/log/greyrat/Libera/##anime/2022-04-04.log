[01:38:00] <Ninetails> It just bores me. And there's so much to do in terms of own projects that i wonder each day why I did accept this proposal regarding the project.
[01:38:54] <Ninetails> Maybe using lasers instead of wide area translucent platforms will help. "Signal it right on their forehead!".

[01:44:23] <Macer> woop
[01:45:00] <Bco1981> 3 cpu cores ?... did one of them die?
[01:45:09] <Macer> ask apple lol
[01:47:19] <Ninetails> vegii : Anything from car, plane, bike, your shoes. Something giving or guaranteeing mobility.
[01:47:27] <Bco1981> like the 3core amd cpu... that no one wanted.
[01:47:33] <Ninetails> As such this also counts for robots.
[01:47:54] <vegii> good, sounds like something I'd prefer over my current job
[01:47:55] <Macer> Bco1981: it actually has 6 cores but i guess some turn on when necessary. 
[01:48:07] <Macer> so palaver probably reads them funny 
[01:48:45] <Bco1981> ah, that makes more sense. espcially since it's a pro
[01:49:06] <Bco1981> 3cores should't be in pro product
[01:49:13] <Bco1981> only*
[01:49:32] <vegii> Ninetails: are you doing the design/concept as prototyping or 3d concept art?
[01:49:43] <bxgelsan> Macer: you arent up to date. i think its 15.4.1 now
[01:49:45] <bxgelsan> go update
[01:49:46] <bxgelsan> :p
[01:49:46] <Macer> it’s 6 cores 
[01:49:51] <Macer> The A10X features an Apple-designed 64-bit 2.38 GHz[3] ARMv8-A six-core CPU, with three high-performance Hurricane cores and three energy-efficient Zephyr cores.
[01:50:40] <vegii> so big.LITTLE but with 1 core broken in each 4
[01:50:49] <Macer> haha 
[01:50:58] <Macer> or designed that way on purpose
[01:51:09] <Macer> i don’t think they have dead cores on them like amd did
[01:51:39] <Ninetails> I do everything from calculations, measurements, aerodynamic design (if necessary), armored design (if necessary), CAD, 3D-printing, fiber compound construction with adequate materials (hand-work myself if necessary), welding (TIG and spot welding myself, laser welding via industrial robotic arms), soldering, development of electronics, development
[01:51:40] <Ninetails> of casings, mechanics, prototyping, stress-testing, destructive limitation testing, optimizing..
[01:52:01] <Macer> bxgelsan: seems like you’re right. 
[01:52:14] <Macer> must have missed that. or it was going to auto update tonight. 
[01:52:38] <Ninetails> At the moment rebuilding my own small home as well, autodidact learning of how to work with the different materials used in construction works.
[01:53:24] <Macer> make it out of iridium 
[01:53:45] <Ninetails> Too expensive and useless in price-usability rating.
[01:54:06] <vegii> Ninetails: if you show someone a PCB and they ask "did you make it yourself?" and it was fabbed by jlc but handsoldered, what do you respond?
[01:54:07] <Macer> heh 
[01:56:00] <Ninetails> vegii : I would say that the board was designed by me, manufactured by a company which offers a wide variety of selectable options in terms of coating, copper thickness, layering, core materials and so on and that I soldered it by hand?
[01:56:42] <Ninetails> But you don't need to reinnovate a wheel to create a new type of mobile armored personal carrier as example. *shrugs*
[01:57:08] <Ninetails> It would just cost too much time missing on important new developments if you redesigned every screw. There are companies specialized on this process.
[01:57:44] <vegii> you mean you don't have to dig your own copper ore when making a toaster?
[01:58:01] <bxgelsan> vegii: only way to prep for installing netbsd.
[01:58:01] <Ninetails> Exactly, because it's a never-ending fundamental problem.
[01:58:10] <bxgelsan> If you are a true fan.
[01:58:12] <bxgelsan> :p
[01:59:05] <Ninetails> You can't reduce a new development on atom molecule size of redevelopment, as such it's useless to reduce a new development of tech unto their basic materials, bolts, whatever.
[01:59:06] <Ninetails> One exception: if you actually did change the basic materials, as example new alloys of stainless steel.

[02:56:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Starting your own is basically your only option other than contracting for design work.
[02:57:02] <Ninetails> vegil : Most companies nowadays work with SolidWorks, Inventor / AutoCAD or compatible (means: file formats are somewhat interchangeable).
[02:57:38] <vegii> I keep getting phonecalls asking about warehouse stock because I have acceess and good memory
[02:58:21] <Ninetails> It helps if you autodidactical through as example video tutorials and .pdf gain an insight in the basics of conceptual studies, computer aided design (nowadays more like "3D design", as the "computer aids" are like a development environment with automatic assistents).
[02:58:52] <vegii> first of all, CATIA is cancer
[02:59:03] <vegii> so I assume solidworks is as well
[02:59:22] <Ninetails> For technical (means: mechanical) constructions CATIA was not seen that often in companies I worked for.
[02:59:40] <Ninetails> SolidWorks works very well. I use it privately as well.
[03:00:23] <vegii> uh, I don't wanna go far beyond PCBA and 3dprinting, so I wanna learn freecad and don't want more
[03:00:26] <Ninetails> It has less "go-arounds" to reach a goal, more ways and styles of how-to reach those.
[03:00:37] <vegii> currently using solvespace usually
[03:00:54] <Ninetails> If you can use FreeCAD, it's not much of a problem to use any of the CAD solutions for basics. But just for basics.
[03:01:57] <Ninetails> If you want free forms, size-changing mechanical parts (as example pneumatic related balloons / pressure parts), it gets harder.
[03:02:01] <vegii> wym basics of conceptual studies?
[03:02:40] <Ninetails> Three axis as example. Relativity of "space" as long as no measures are applied. Why it is important to fix open measures by declaring them.
[03:03:31] <vegii> "fix open measures" - I guess you're talking about constraints
[03:03:52] <vegii> to eliminate unwanted degrees of freedom
[03:04:04] <Ninetails> I am not native English, so it's the best I can explain it.
[03:04:30] <Ninetails> Yes, constraints through either fixating it or applying specific links to other parts of the drawing.
[03:04:40] <Ninetails> "goes parallel", "same length", "same curvature" etc.
[03:04:51] <vegii> me neither but I rarely use Internet content in other languages
[03:07:09] <Ninetails> If a drawing is logically concluded to not possess open measures (means: undefined), then you wouldn't be able to pull one side in the length. That can be a positive aspect and helps with creating conflict free third party file formats (as else the missing definitions might result in weird interpretation of the space), but it as well can be
[03:07:10] <Ninetails> negative if you ain't able to move movable parts in a "one part" environment / drawing.
[03:07:45] <Ninetails> It's possible to draw each part, module individually and put them into place at a work space (basically multi-part environment), as example for renderings.
[03:08:15] <Ninetails> But most users will leave wanted freedoms open for changes, so to easily create different, but almost-same parts out of one conceptual design.
[03:09:27] <vegii> I mean I've used solvespace which is parametric
[03:09:35] <Ninetails> The utmost important aspect I would like to give you if you want to use it for 3D printing is: You'll be tricked by scaling.
[03:10:21] <vegii> unsure if you mean unit interpretation or tolerances
[03:10:28] <Ninetails> Even if you think about "2mm wall thickness is exactly this thick" and abstract all other measures on this basic, to create the size of the final product that you need, you might be tricked by the presentation of the screen.

[03:11:13] <Ninetails> It's helpful to resize it to 1:1 real presentation in relation to your screen size before trying to print it. As the first 2-3 years you might end up with either too massively or too tiny designed whole parts, hehe.
[03:11:42] <vegii> I have calipers on my desk
[03:11:58] <vegii> shitty plastic ones with 0.1mm precision, they slide nicely
[03:12:22] <vegii> *0.1mm resolution
[03:12:54] <vegii> Ninetails: what's your first language?
[03:12:56] <Ninetails> That's good, but it's more of a perspective problem. You might -know- that the wall thickness is 4 mm as example and still get tricked by the 3D model on screen in thinking "that's too thin for those loads applied", even if you can calculate the loads applied and the material properties right out while sleeping.
[03:13:09] <Ninetails> German, still
[03:15:07] <Ninetails> *silence followed, the tumble weed tumbles through the empty stares* Yea, that's life.
[03:15:24] <vegii> so, the plastic shitty caliper isn't a Messgerät, but a Schätzgerät, but a useful one
[03:15:50] <Ninetails> They are still measure devices. Depending on the precision and tolerances of what you want to build, they are even too precise, hehe.
[03:16:04] <Ninetails> Ever saw any construction worker measure the door frame fitting with a caliper? ;)
[03:16:46] <vegii> dude, I've laid silver-coated audio cables with an old electrician who measured cable length by steps
[03:16:56] *** Quits: bxgelsan (~bxgelsan@user/bxgelsan) (Quit: brb)
[03:17:12] <Ninetails> Too precise measurements which take additional time to interpret or write down are not helpful at all. If you can only produce (as example weld) the resulting parts with a tolerance of one millimeter, it doesn't help the slightest to have 1/10000th precision.
[03:17:45] <Ninetails> (In the drawings or calculations)
[03:18:17] <Ninetails> Most CNC machinery nowadays works up to 1/100th millimeter precise over a distance of 500 or 1000 mm.
[03:19:03] <Ninetails> But even just worn down tools (a thing beloved by companies for third party "cheap" small orders to use until oblivion, as they don't cost new money) will raise that tolerance to 1/2 mm easily.
[03:20:14] <Ninetails> Some high precision machines work to 0,5/100th or even 1/1000th, but in this conditions (even in 1/100th mm tolerances) the room climate plays a big role, even the amount of water in the air.
[03:20:53] *** Joins: bxgelsan (~bxgelsan@user/bxgelsan)
[03:21:15] <vegii> I know... but still, that old electrician was measuring silver-coated audiophile cable in S T E P S and cutting it
[03:21:40] <Ninetails> As such it's quite useless to draw or concept your designs to such tolerances if you don't want on paying 50 times more at the end to get them produces. If not necessary, take a well-fitting, well-tightening and wear-preventing tolerance level which doesn't cost more just to have a shinier (surface more even) result.
[03:21:47] <Ninetails> Yea, why not?
[03:22:17] <Ninetails> If I measure rough cable lengths, I use the distance of my middle fingers with spread arms. Those stay the same since uhh.. 25 years?
[03:22:37] <ButterNoodle> !seen amigojapan
[03:22:38] <ImoutoBot> ButterNoodle: amigojapan was last seen in ##anime 8 hours and 2 minutes ago: <amigojapan> Ok I am out
[03:22:43] <ButterNoodle> dicks out
[03:23:05] <Ninetails> At the end I have to cut off maybe 5 cm of overlength to fit it 1:1, but only took 2 minutes to measure it instead of 30. This is worth more money than those 5 cm cable length as example.
[03:23:12] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: ButterNoodle: is a 5 port coax splitter with only 2 ports used... yes
[03:23:33] <vegii> Ninetails: because then one segment was 5m too long ang the other was uncomfortably short
[03:23:34] <ButterNoodle> vegii: what a phile?
[03:23:41] <ButterNoodle> O.O
[03:25:46] <Ninetails> vegil : Then he could just use different body measurements if known. Like one arm length or from chin to earth. Add 5-10 cm at the end to make sure and cut them off after precise fitting on finishing it. Even if you measure it with a Zollstock precisely and take 30 times longer to measure it exactly, you might wonder how much one smaller or bigger
[03:25:46] <Ninetails> radius could change the effective length you needed at the end. As such cutting some fail-safe over length off is usual.
[03:26:24] <Ninetails> ButterNoodle : Someone loving audio or the corresponding hardware. Purely definition-linked even in a sexual way, buuut.. most don't. They just worship them.

[03:27:44] <vegii> yes
[03:28:33] <ButterNoodle> I think there is a difference between asmr requiring crisp reproduction vs someone cumming to the tonal warmth that is a tube driven PA deck
[03:29:06] <ButterNoodle> pure fets can give u the desired reproduction of nipple licking with extra spit..

[03:39:28] <Ninetails> It's not possible for those small units to "turn against their leaders" - as if those would care. But they care if millions of value get transferred freely to the opposite site.
[03:40:42] <ButterNoodle> good way to die for ur values in a way that wouldnt matter to anyone
[03:40:57] <ButterNoodle> just like the morons in the US that talk about taking action...
[03:41:49] <ButterNoodle> when idiots as leaders say u need a few f16s and some nuk3s to take on a government.. tongue in cheek - a government willing to use military force on its citizens
[03:41:57] <ButterNoodle> thats all this is really
[03:42:20] <Ninetails> Russia doesn't actually want to use nukes. Nobody does.
[03:42:42] <Ninetails> Absolutely nobody on this fucking planet. Aside those that want to die (hardly any in positions of power in the army).
[03:42:58] <ButterNoodle> ... I think the US president is salivating to, or at least use some bio weapons "in kind" has he put it
[03:44:20] <ButterNoodle> yes and kim jong un just wants to be left alone to play xbox..
[03:45:14] <Ninetails> Kim wouldn't try to actually -nuke- any of their neighbor countries, even put aside the 95%+ I assume of failure ratios even on the launch of their systems, lol.
[03:45:27] <Ninetails> He lives by fear mongering and ignorance, best life..
[03:45:31] <ButterNoodle> idk man
[03:45:36] <ButterNoodle> china got his back
[03:48:01] <Ninetails> China doesn't exactly want to be labeled an initial attacker regarding a world war. Maximum I see is delivery of resources to NK. Same as Russia does and did to NK since UDSSR times over the transsiberian rail line.
[03:48:29] <Ninetails> But they won't deliver weapons which could result in a bad omen to them self.
[03:48:44] <Ninetails> Nothing high tech, fully functional. Why should they. What's to win out of it?
[03:50:01] <Ninetails> NK mostly looks like a third world country in the time of 1925 to 35.
[03:52:29] <Ninetails> Only a few places are actually "theaters" where visitors should be manipulated into thinking "wow, such a rich and thriving, happy country!" - but even to keep those farces up costs them a lot. There is no private companies, big industry in that country. Nothing an attacker could replenish own lost resources out by "just declaring it their own".
[03:52:30] <Ninetails> They got some material values bound in the earth which take lots of work and time to refine, but that's not exactly Katar with oil fields.

[06:45:28] <Roey> I didn't realize there is friction between some folks in this channel.
[06:45:33] <Ninetails> I know that whip, but it's more of a flail and was used for torturing.

[06:55:13] <amigojapan> I think after I said that is when tsunderenoises said /me chloroforms amigojapan , that should have been part of the quote
[06:57:35] <amigojapan> Wow that was 2021, feels like yesterday
[06:58:38] <amigojapan> What davic ?
[06:58:54] <amigojapan> Stop doing what?
[07:00:04] <Ninetails> Did you maybe send him client commands to request status information about his client or time / ping?
[07:00:34] <amigojapan> I have not mentioned him at all. No
[07:00:54] <amigojapan> I have no idea what he is complaining about
[07:01:06] <Ninetails> Could in some scripted browsers happen by right clicking the nickname and requesting properties or details. The browser would then send the commands and process them into a popup information.
[07:01:35] <Ninetails> Hmm, wonders me. No browser should send it automatically (it's either unwanted or forbidden in many places)
[07:01:54] <Ninetails> Not the browser, the client. Just browser if it's a browser client.
[07:02:04] <Ninetails> Brain = offline actually.
[07:02:52] <Ninetails> Let me test something, amigojapan
[07:03:14] <amigojapan> I don't know why he says "that"and does not mention what he means, so we can only guess
[07:03:37] <Ninetails> Your client is as example marked as "IRCCloud irccloud.com"
[07:04:02] <amigojapan> Yup
[07:04:25] <Ninetails> And some of the clients give the user a notice if someone else sends them a CTCP request (which can be disturbing, that's what he probably meant by the ping request, as there exists such one).
[07:05:07] <Ninetails> But if you didn't do this willingly it is confusing, hum.
[07:05:09] <amigojapan> I am not sending him ctcp requests
[07:06:04] <ButterNoodle> Roey: I think the universe told me something today..
[07:06:06] <Ninetails> Hmm, then the only thing coming into mind would be that you quoted or mentioned his user name somewhere and he got a noticing from his client out of it.
[07:06:07] <ButterNoodle> start playing again
[07:06:46] <ButterNoodle> *3rd reference to music, and jazz specifically today
[07:06:50] <amigojapan> But I did but do that either Ninetails 
[07:07:27] <Ninetails> Yea, then I have no idea what happened as well, sorry. Maybe he'll answer later.
[07:07:27] <amigojapan> Did not*
[07:07:35] <amigojapan> Ok
[07:10:12] <amigojapan> Ninetails: I think I know what he means
[07:10:34] <Ninetails> Different channel?
[07:10:56] <amigojapan> Ninetails: I did !seen tsunderenoises. And tsunderenoises mentioned him on his last comment
[07:11:16] <amigojapan> I do that often
[07:11:31] <Ninetails> Ahh. Yes, then it's exactly that, it highlights him and the client reacts (that can be annoying).
[07:12:13] <amigojapan> I see, but I don't know another way to verify if tsunderenoises was here
[07:12:26] <Ninetails> "here"? Like online?
[07:12:32] <amigojapan> Maybe I will do it thru PM 
[07:12:41] <amigojapan> Yes Ninetails

[07:15:03] <Ninetails> That's just related to this channel, yes. A statistic made by the bot you requested information of right now (ImoutoBot).
[07:15:21] <amigojapan> Yup
[07:15:34] <Ninetails> I just checked the last seen timer of this network itself, means the last time he identified on this IRC network.
[07:15:40] <amigojapan> That's what I want to know tho
[07:16:22] <Ninetails> Without this it would be hard to "see" him here (as a bot) as without being online he can't be seen here as well. That makes it quite easy to check. Only difference would be if he did not join this channel after joining and identifying on the network.
[07:16:54] <Ninetails> You can just write the following: /msg nickserv info Nickname (in this case TsundereNoises)
[07:17:11] <amigojapan> Right
[07:18:44] *** Quits: aHick (~memes@143.60.229.4) (Remote host closed the connection)
[07:19:10] <Ninetails> If he uses secondary nicknames not in one nick group, then this doesn't help, surely enough. But related to if ImoutoBot actually links users (as a ban / kick evasion technology) by their host or vserv if set, in most cases the bot wouldn't know as well if he was here under another nickname (if it doesn't link those secondary user details i.e.).
[07:19:45] <amigojapan> Ninetails: it's possible to do !seen tsunderenoises thru PM to imoutobot and that should not ping him
[07:20:11] <Ninetails> If that works and the bot reacts to notices or queries, that's good.
[07:20:27] <amigojapan> Yup
[07:27:57] <Ninetails> I am wondering if the local "sausage roaster" (basically a small company with partnerships to super markets which roasts sausages and steaks in front of them and offers them with buns for some hours over the week) will be there today.
[07:29:14] <amigojapan> Ninetails: I guess there is only one way to find out
[07:29:32] <Ninetails> Should be in around five hours. Let's see, might probably buy 4 steaks with buns and 5 sausages as a short-time compensation to not buying fast food for at least two weeks.
[07:29:58] <Ninetails> amigojapan : Yes, it's only 200 meters to walk, not a problem. Dog is happy as well if he gets to walk another round.
[07:30:24] <amigojapan> Good exercise
[07:31:53] <amigojapan> I ate some cashew nuts
[07:32:24] <Ninetails> The black hole in this stomach has to get filled, after all. Energy for the hole god.
[07:33:23] <amigojapan> Hope the hole God is not a tape worm :)
[07:33:46] <Ninetails> Hmm, that would be the oldest tape worm of all times - and the most invisible one, lol.
[07:34:05] <amigojapan> :)
[07:34:13] <Ninetails> At the end I'm just a tape worm with a human costume remaining. Dang it, that would suck.
[07:34:34] <amigojapan> Ouch
[07:35:14] <Ninetails> Cashew nuts are tasty as well, but very high in calories for small amounts of filling mass for the stomach.

[08:24:51] * klys bows
[08:25:07] <leibniz> i initially joined rizon because of anime 
[08:25:12] <leibniz> i always thought i was an anime server
[08:25:17] <leibniz> now it's become a troll server
[08:25:18] <klys> genki deshou ka?
[08:25:32] <leibniz> i mean
[08:25:46] <leibniz> i always thought rizon was an anime server 
[08:26:25] <klys> rizon is...unique...and I know nothing because I haven't spent the last year there
[08:26:34] <Ninetails> Good morning, isekaijin .
[08:26:44] <klys> ohayou
[08:27:17] <isekaijin> How are you doing?
[08:27:43] <klys> genki da, doumou yo
[08:28:41] <isekaijin> What's the Rizon community like? Do they also have a channel for talking about both software and vtubers?

[08:29:15] <Ninetails> Doing fine, just preparing for groceries shopping in around one hour.
[08:29:22] <klys> not the place for software, for that you need libera
[08:29:52] <klys> rizon is like 4chan/soc I guess
[08:29:58] <leibniz> yuh
[08:30:16] <leibniz> no rizon is for 4chan 8chan and trolling
[08:30:28] <Ninetails> Rizon had quite a few XDCC channels in the past. Aside from that much trolling and private affairs.
[08:30:38] <leibniz> it used to have xdcc
[08:30:50] <leibniz> but i hardly use dcc anymore
[08:30:56] <leibniz> i know of a few xdcc channels still
[08:31:01] <leibniz> but idk if they have anime
[08:31:22] <Ninetails> Mostly oday stuff from Russian release groups at that time.
[08:32:52] <klys> there's a budding community at lunarirc.net
[08:33:11] <klys> not sure about anime relevance there either
[08:33:47] <klys> leibniz, how was your weekend?
[08:34:36] <leibniz> it was ok
[08:34:47] <leibniz> not doing much

[09:44:17] <ButterNoodle> well
[09:44:23] <ButterNoodle> that just hurts u and the house

[12:18:52] <BillyZane> :D
[12:19:01] <JesseDesu> the F-35 looks like a nerfed design
[12:19:11] <BillyZane> yeah
[12:19:21] <BillyZane> F-16 felt more aggressive
[12:19:23] <BillyZane> like a dart
[12:19:25] <JesseDesu> the F-22 is cool but it will never see action unless WW3 is started
[12:19:35] <BillyZane> like the thing works by ramming itself in to the target
[12:19:51] <JesseDesu> the F-16s with upper conformal fuel tanks look atrocious
[12:20:06] <JesseDesu> greek polish and turkey have them
[12:20:13] <JesseDesu> and taiwan i think
[12:20:32] <JesseDesu> i'm glad the usaf stopped buying them at block 50/52
[12:20:34] <BillyZane> the US is purchasing less F-35s, meanwhile allied countries are buying more of them
[12:20:51] <BillyZane> those fuel tanks help out a lot
[12:20:56] <JesseDesu> well, the world has to fight the wars for us
[12:21:01] <BillyZane> lol
[12:21:06] <JesseDesu> we supply them

[12:21:38] <JesseDesu> "Will the F-35 make a good replacement for the A-10" click bait
[12:21:42] <JesseDesu> i already know the answer
[12:22:23] <BillyZane> lol
[12:22:44] <JesseDesu> aircraft that are survivable by themselves arent really a necessity to the US
[12:22:47] <BillyZane> i think they're planning to keep the A-10 longer
[12:22:53] <BillyZane> they can't get rid of it
[12:23:05] <BillyZane> it's made in like 50 states or somethin XD
[12:23:18] <JesseDesu> the US and its allies can coordinate air operations much better than potential adversaries
[12:23:30] <BillyZane> i bet you the A-10 would have rekt the russians in ukraine
[12:23:30] <JesseDesu> so a support jammer or drone or whatever is good enough
[12:23:49] <JesseDesu> the javelin is the hand held A-10
[12:23:56] <JesseDesu> i saw a documentary on it
[12:24:00] <JesseDesu> was that you who linked it
[12:24:04] <BillyZane> yeah it is pretty impressive
[12:24:23] <JesseDesu> its a fire and forget, automatically flies up and targets the top of the armor where it is thinnest
[12:24:46] <BillyZane> armor is not safe anymore
[12:24:46] <JesseDesu> somehow that small but critical feature costs hundreds of thousands
[12:24:56] <BillyZane> i think this is a very interesting time
[12:24:58] <BillyZane> do you know what this means?
[12:25:11] <BillyZane> it means you have to remove humans for the battlefield
[12:25:54] <JesseDesu> there will be a phase in phase out
[12:26:54] <BillyZane> if you're not safe in tanks, then you're better off far back. the tanks should be unmanned, the mobile rocket launchers, submarines and even naval vessels
[12:27:37] <JesseDesu> the only safe tank is the abrahams
[12:27:47] <JesseDesu> and whatever top of the line the brits have
[12:28:02] <JesseDesu> we share some tank tech with them
[12:28:06] <BillyZane> the air should be dominated by small, medium, and large drones, swarming, controlling the electronic spectrum with overwhelming power output

[12:31:52] <JesseDesu> emphasis on air superiority
[12:32:01] <JesseDesu> before committing ground forces
[12:32:13] <BillyZane> they have a large airforce i believe

[18:59:07] <JesseDesu> for beginning paint theres gundam markers which might be easier than brush painting
[18:59:18] <JesseDesu> its like a paint marker

[19:01:18] <JesseDesu> amigojapan the kit maybe $20-30 but tools and paints are generally a 70$ investment if you wanna do it right
[19:01:37] <amigojapan> I see Jesse
[19:01:50] <JesseDesu> otherwise the less paint stuff you buy the more toylike the model will be
[19:01:52] <JesseDesu> which is fine

[20:07:56] <amigojapan> On the radio
[20:07:58] <Miyukii> If the ABS module notices your brakes are bad you barely had brakes for a long time
[20:08:04] <ButterNoodle> lol amigojapan
[20:08:13] <ButterNoodle> Miyukii: never seen that
[20:08:48] <Miyukii> Low pressure in the hydraulic system is the only thing that throws a light on most cars
[20:08:53] <ButterNoodle> abs light comes on.. probably bubble in the unit or a bad sensor.. idk of any vehicle that monitors pad thickness
[20:09:06] <ButterNoodle> Miyukii: yep u right there
[20:09:16] <Bco1981> low pressure in any wheel
[20:09:29] <Miyukii> but some can notice bad brake performance. Though if it gets that you should've noticed that yourself long ago
[20:09:29] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: during my trip from Mexico city to new York city. I noticed the music changed several times on the radio
[20:10:47] * ButterNoodle puts the radio on scan
[20:11:16] <ButterNoodle> Miyukii: yea I'd say most people just be like "car feel a lil strange, maybe it needs an oil change"
[20:12:08] <Miyukii> These days people apparently need a giant popup on the infotainment screen
[20:12:18] <Miyukii> weird symbol on dash isn't enough anymore
[20:12:45] <ButterNoodle> very true
[20:13:34] <ButterNoodle> but.. my mom had a car that would speak the problem.. literally saying "engine is over heating. turn off the engine" and she kept driving it
[20:13:45] <ButterNoodle> *well I gotta get home...
[20:14:17] <Miyukii> Can't do anything about those kind of drivers
[20:14:36] <ButterNoodle> yep.. I feel thats the majority based on the appearances of cars on the road
[20:14:45] <Miyukii> Or you gotta go the route BMW took and just disable the car once it gets a major fault code
[20:14:46] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: if that was a PC it would turn off itself before damaging the internals
[20:15:07] <ButterNoodle> a car cant turn itself off on the interstate tho
[20:15:14] <ButterNoodle> would be nice if it would
[20:15:27] <Miyukii> A pc doesn't have human lives in its hands usually

[21:49:05] <JesseDesu> normal wear and tear probably not covered
[21:49:14] <JesseDesu> ah start of wearing

[21:51:45] <ButterNoodle> shoei themselves -lead you to believe- their helmets are good for a lot longer, but for "warranty and safety purposes" they are only guaranteed to 5 years

[21:59:02] <JesseDesu> nice
[21:59:11] <ButterNoodle> so apple makes sense
[21:59:55] <JesseDesu> Is a dirt bike helmet street legal?  Off-road helmets can meet all the same safety motorcycle helmet safety standards that street helmets do like Snell, DOT, and ECE. So, the answer to the question can you use an MX helmet on the road, or can you use a dirt bike helmet for Street riding is in most cases yes

[22:44:37] <JesseDesu> i didnt know what hi capa's meant until this morning
[22:44:54] <JesseDesu> i thought it was a stupid name for a gun
[22:45:34] <analoq> it's been a while. i don't quite remember what i shoot. one was a .22 sport pistol. that was pretty cool. one was an older police carabiner rifle (dont remember the caliber) and some old american service revolver (smaller than 9mm, maybe .380?)
[22:45:54] <JesseDesu> A hi capa is a bastardization of high capacity. The pistol is a high capacity m1911.... better known as a m2011.... made in 2011.... its a double stack 1911 in real life with some added modern features.Feb 25, 2019
[22:48:45] <analoq> the thing is i suck with guns. like if i look through them the target looks tiny.
[22:49:21] <analoq> i shot a decent amount of air rifles, so it's not like im totally new to it. but all i can say is 'yes im roughly on the target' :D

[22:51:57] <JesseDesu> i dont know what a hop up is

[22:52:15] <analoq> Urchin[emacs]: idk im pretty good with that kind of stuff. i can leave both eyes open. dont have issues with eye dominance etc
[22:52:23] <JesseDesu> also, does the red safety dot mean its off or on when its covered
[22:52:36] <analoq> it's just that the dots are so huge they cover so much of the target
[22:52:39] <Urchin[emacs]> analoq: for quick acquisition of target, it's usually recommended to shift focus between front sight and target (this goes double for pistols)
[22:53:28] <JesseDesu> just let the bot do its autoaim thing

[23:04:47] <lastonestanding> I wonder if Elon would unban Trump
[23:07:26] <Urchin[emacs]> doubt it
[23:08:33] <analoq> wonder why he would buy into such a boring company
[23:09:00] <lastonestanding> he probably has too much power
[23:09:36] <isekaijin> Why was Trump banned again? I get that Twitter is a private platform and they can ban whoever they want, but that doesn't speak well of US-owned platforms in general.
[23:09:37] <analoq> *gotta make sure they cant ban my main money generating tool* :P
[23:13:50] <Roey> isekaijin: it'll be interesting now with Elon, as lastonestanding mentions; I'm interested in seeing what becomes of this
[23:14:30] <Urchin[emacs]> isekaijin: there was probably a laundry list of reasons, even if we don't include the attempted coup
[23:15:18] <ButterNoodle> !g coup

[23:19:20] <isekaijin> Urchin[emacs]: If it was an attempted coup, it was a really lousy attempt. Sure, he brought a bunch of hooligans to the Capitol, but he didn't bring literal armed forces.
[23:20:31] <ButterNoodle> bunch of cosplayers and feds... attempted to take over the most powerful cuntry in the world /s
[23:20:54] <analoq> i wonder how they thought this works.
[23:21:08] <analoq> *hold this building for 1h and you own the country* ?

[23:21:27] <ButterNoodle> analoq: yea 
[23:21:38] <ButterNoodle> because they were thinking of taking over the cuntry..
[23:22:10] <analoq> ButterNoodle: does this work with neighboring properties as well? :O
[23:23:05] <Urchin[emacs]> isekaijin: there were several notable dictators who had their first coup be very lousy attempts
[23:23:36] <Urchin[emacs]> isekaijin: like one in South America (forgot who), who ended up spending the night of the coup locked in a museum by mistake
[23:23:37] <analoq> even hitler failed at first
[23:23:40] <ButterNoodle> I hear if you feed the protesters for more than 2 days, they are now your property
[23:23:42] <analoq> nobody starts perfect :D
[23:23:50] <isekaijin> Practice makes perfect!
[23:24:53] <Urchin[emacs]> and, indeed, Hitler's first coup attempt was pretty comical: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_Hall_Putsch

[23:27:17] <analoq> hitler got 'imprisoned' for that in an actual castle where he dictated 'mein kampf' (didnt even write his own book, or rather had a guy writing it for him while imprisoned xD)
[23:27:19] <lastonestanding> but why did they send their criminals so damn far away?
[23:27:28] <lastonestanding> from UK to australia
