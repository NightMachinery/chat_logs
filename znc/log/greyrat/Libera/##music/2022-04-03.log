[01:12:30] <morf> that's interesting :]
[01:14:25] <MusicalDillo> The speed of sound changes on Earth too depending on temperature and altitude
[01:14:41] <MusicalDillo> humidity, etc
[01:15:03] <morf> yeah but you have to move to some other place
[01:15:31] <morf> there you have 2 different in the same place 
[01:15:39] <morf> They had discovered there are two speeds of sound on the surface of Mars—one for high-pitched sounds like the zap of the laser, and another for lower frequencies like the whir of the helicopter rotor.
[01:15:51] <morf> On Earth, the sounds from an orchestra reach you at the same speed, whether they are low or high. But imagine on Mars, if you are a little far from the stage, there will be a big delay
[01:16:33] <morf> also this All of these factors would make it difficult for two people to have a conversation only five meters (16 feet) apart

[03:55:09] <morf_> yes
[03:55:12] <morf_> it's bs
[03:55:34] <DarkJord> haha
[03:55:36] <DarkJord> nice1
[03:55:47] <DarkJord> i mean. it exists. you may not be a fan
[03:55:51] <DarkJord> but its certainly a thing
[03:56:11] <DarkJord> its just slight distortion of higher frequencies
[03:57:00] <DarkJord> they can be easily emulated and often are in most music production
[03:57:26] <DarkJord> whether its an analog synth or tape plugin. 
[03:58:35] <louipc> the warmth is a low level distortion
[03:58:55] <louipc> it actually means your system is lower quality
[03:59:16] <louipc> DarkJord: oh dang u said it hehe
[03:59:41] <DarkJord> lower quality is one way to think about it. i thing it brings character.
[04:01:05] <louipc> it's less true to the original performance
[04:01:33] <louipc> but i guess you know how everythign is multitracked and remixed that doesnt quite matter anymore either
[04:01:41] <DarkJord> yeah if you're recording instruments sure
[04:01:56] <DarkJord> but what about an analog synth. thats pretty true
[04:02:16] <DarkJord> but yeah, i guess you're right
[04:02:40] <morf_> it's bs
[04:02:44] <louipc> well then whatever fuzz, hiss, warmth they put it was intended if they add it in synths
[04:02:53] <morf_> is there some scientific proof?

[04:03:07] <DarkJord> why yes ofc

[04:04:16] <murthy> Marshall are an example
[04:06:25] <louipc> oh yea tube amps vs solid state

[04:06:59] <louipc> goodmornin
[04:07:03] <DarkJord> louipc: you're right about analog warmth lowering the quality of most standard instruments getting played through amps etc. but analog synth components produce it by heating up and creating that subtle distorntion. so in that case it would be true to performance yea?
[04:07:05] <murthy> louipc: gm
[04:07:47] <louipc> DarkJord: yes. but added distortion via recording process/format is not true to performance
[04:07:54] <DarkJord> oh yes. that is true
[04:08:14] <murthy> my guess is that the millennials have no idea of the warmth of the analog of the walkmans

[04:08:54] <murthy> louipc: ya

[04:29:41] <morf_> find me some scientific paper it exists and i will believe it

[04:38:04] <DarkJord> its jsut a case of harmonics. not sure what music you listen to but i'd guarantee you at least a few of the artists you like use analog warmth  to achieve certain sounds. 
[04:39:18] <DarkJord> saturation etc
[04:40:49] <DarkJord> warmth is not just one thing, its a multitude of harmonic characteristics

[11:02:44] <artao> maybe i'll look for a monitor WITH a bezel. cuz the only monitors i've broken are bezel-less
[11:02:47] <artao> two of em
[11:03:04] <artao> my monitor with a bezel has been knocked around a bit and is fine
[11:03:35] <artao> 19 inches tho. ouch
[11:03:50] <darkjord> as long as it works you can get shit done.

[11:09:05] <artao> :\
[11:09:31] <artao> i have two CRTs but no way to hook them up. my gfx card doesn't have the right connections
[11:09:39] <artao> nor do i have an adapater
[11:09:50] <louipc> get the bigger model
[11:11:15] <Digit> going from triple 32 inch portrait mounted monitors, to this cheapo that changes colours from top to bottom and moving head an inch, did sting.  went from 8core 4ghz & 32gig, to 1.8ghz single core celeron with 3gig, stung more than the monitor drop tho.
[11:11:30] <Digit> cant so easily make my music on this scrawny rig.
[11:12:30] <darkjord> triple 32? lol. I feel like I'd be moving my head too much
[11:12:46] <Digit> darkjord: that's why they're portrait mounted.
[11:13:02] <darkjord> still huge. you doing vid work?
[11:13:12] <Digit> nope.  no vid work at all.  
[11:13:35] <Digit> tho, watched vids while working.  n_n
[11:13:43] <Digit> i say "working"... XD
[11:13:50] <darkjord> you almost have to with that much real estate lol
[11:14:18] <darkjord> watch videos while working that is
[11:14:30] <Digit> terminals, browser, video, gimp, audacity, emacs, being the main things i'd typically have in view with that.
[11:15:23] <darkjord> I use two 27s and a 16" laptop monitor. is about perfect for me. 
[11:16:16] <Digit> i think now if i went to a single 32", i'd still want it potrait mounted.  handy for various things, audacity mostly.
[11:17:00] <artao> the monitor i broke is a 27" and frankly that's about as big as my space can handle
[11:17:01] <Digit> easier to scrunch the horizontal timeline shorter than the vertical stack of tracks
[11:17:21] <artao> Digit ouch :O
[11:17:45] <artao> why all portrait mounted?
[11:17:45] * Digit made the space, turned his room sideways, when getting the 32"s.
[11:18:12] <artao> thankfully, my remaining monitor is my GOOD monitor. better color and contrast. i've had it a long time now
[11:18:30] <artao> acer b336hl
[11:18:37] <artao> no longer available or i'd just get another of those
[11:18:56] <artao> the one i broke is a Viewsonic
[11:19:19] <artao> decent enuf color but not so great contrast
[11:19:42] <Digit> artao: i count at least 4 reasons i've already given... still want more reasons why portrait mounting?
[11:19:54] <artao> oh
[11:20:12] <artao> sry
[11:20:13] <artao> right
[11:20:42] <artao> my Acer can pivot to portrait but i've never actually used it that way
[11:21:50] <artao> i figured i'd use it for painting
[11:21:57] <artao> LOL guess not
[11:22:04] <artao> even when i DO do portrait format work
[11:23:51] <artao> seems i missed 3 days of my meds
[11:24:04] <artao> no wonder i'm so full of self-loathing and guilt

[23:37:49] <efex> why would it be perfectly round is more the question imho
[23:38:22] <efex> a bumpy lumpy bumpy is so much more “natural"
[23:39:06] <Digit> "perfectly" nah, tricky to define.  but... if it were, say, um, is it neutron stars, are really smooth surfaced?
[23:39:42] <Digit> we too small to gravitationally press down all our bumps here on earth
[23:41:37] <efex> digit could be, that is a differnt question of course
[23:42:18] <efex> I would assume they are lumpy as well, but everything scaled down as far as lump size
