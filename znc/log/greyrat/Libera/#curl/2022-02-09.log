[11:14:33] -curelbot- [GitHub] Issue #8410: azure pipelines suddenly died (https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/8410)
[11:27:37] <GodEater> bagder: weird, out of the blue question - but do you remember - we met up for drinks in London one evening years ago, and I seem to recall being a hotel bar with you when a fellow swede you knew showed up to say hi. I've completely forgotten who it was though.
[11:28:36] <bagder> wasn't that Andreas Ehn ? ex-spotify person
[11:28:43] <GodEater> ah that's right!
[11:29:10] <GodEater> I thought he was something to do with spotify, I just wasn't sure.
[11:33:33] <bagder> it's funny since I got to know him when we ran into him in another bar: Dilirium at some fosdem many years ago
[11:33:52] <GodEater> drinking is always a great way to meet people :D
[11:34:41] <bagder> he's in your neck of the world these days, as he lives in Singapore now
[11:35:09] <GodEater> still never been deeper into singapore than the airport - I must rectify that
[11:37:25] <bagder> I was there once. Wow, that was now 29 years ago. 1993. I bet it's a little different now =)
[11:39:22] <bagder> I got some fast responses from MS people so hopefully we'll get some attention on the azure thing when US peeps wake up
