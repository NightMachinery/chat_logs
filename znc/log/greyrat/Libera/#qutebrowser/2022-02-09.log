[08:48:09] <toofar> maybe `:session-load default`, but it depends how you closed it if anything got saved

[19:25:14] <ccx> I'd love to get https://github.com/danny0838/webscrapbook working under Qutebrowser. From what I gathered WebExtensions aren't a thing right now. So this would entail writing some Python client code and integrating it somehow?
[19:26:41] <ccx> I know Qutebrowser already has support for saving a snapshot of a web page, albeit in different format, so it would only be matter of uploading it to WebScrapbook server.
[19:31:14] <Earnestly> You have access to all of qute api, some stable api, and unstable (you keep pieces)
[19:31:27] <Earnestly> The stable bits are under qutebrowser.api
