[00:09:32] <MetaNova> gordonfish: there are options
[00:10:09] <MetaNova> gordonfish: in no particular order, you can consider 1) just disconnecting your IRC client from that one network for a while, then check back later
[00:10:49] <MetaNova> 2) if your client supports regex/message content filtering, then just squelch the patterns which *status uses when mentioning disconnects and reconnects
[00:11:20] <MetaNova> 3) put *status on /ignore (probably not the best choice)
[00:11:39] <MetaNova> oh. you could just tell that network to not try connecting for a while
[00:11:41] <MetaNova> that would work, too

[00:50:58] <Khaytsus> Maybe try a specific (list of) server(s) rather than a round robin if you're having an issue with a single server maybe
[00:53:14] <MetaNova> that's some oldschool tactics right there
[00:53:30] <MetaNova> but in a bad enough situation, it might still be a legitimate strategy
[00:54:02] <Khaytsus> Yeah, but there's a few servers on effin' net that are just junk, I had to put in a list of 4-5 servers

[01:12:26] <jcbjoe2021> *clientbuffer is so wierd. i will deal with it later but i just started using hexchat right. on my laptop i get all the logs and backlog and everything, came down to the windows desktop in the house. logged in the same way as i did on my laptop and i get no backlog nothing. *clientbuffer is set up also with autoadd, so wierd
[01:13:43] <bookworm> if you set it up "the same way" you'd have reused the client identifier which would obviously not have the desired effect
[01:13:54] <bookworm> it needs a separate client ID per device
[01:14:13] <bookworm> well, client actually, not necessarily device
[01:19:15] <jcbjoe2021> bookworm, makes sense cause i have identifiers for all my phones but for some reason i didn't add one for my laptop and the windows machine they are the same. so wierd 0_o
[01:19:22] <jcbjoe2021> let me change them
[01:21:42] <jcbjoe2021> I think i fixed it. let me go check on the windows desktop

[01:51:50] <MetaNova> step 1: fetch what servers are currently part of the round-robin

[01:52:18] <MetaNova> step 3: make note of your best options
[01:53:34] <Khaytsus> I've heard of people adding something to dnsmasq to keep using the round robin address, but dnsmasq is pre-loaded with the hostnames.  I just put N servers in ZNC, it's fine

[21:51:59] <MetaNova> polymorphic: [[Dcc]] is for you to send and receive files between your client and the PWD of the ZNC instance. [[Bouncedcc]] is when ZNC actually intercepts and handles (as a middleman) the DCC transfer from their client to ZNC and then from ZNC to yourself
[21:51:59] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Dcc https://wiki.znc.in/Bouncedcc
[21:53:01] <MetaNova> that distinction being made, I don't think even with bouncedcc ZNC will just retrieve an entire transfer on your behalf and then wait for you to retrieve it yourself
[21:53:24] *** Quits: PeGaSuS (ubuntu@user/pegasus) (Remote host closed the connection)
[21:53:48] <MetaNova> (I think your client has to be present/receptive, but, this is just best guess, DCC is weird and I try to touch it as little as possible)
[21:54:04] *** Joins: PeGaSuS (ubuntu@user/pegasus)
[21:54:44] <polymorphic> Yeah, I understood that aspect of bounce. Was hoping I could have something drop to a file location for me to look at or grab later or for an automated system to handle it.

[21:59:27] <MetaNova> polymorphic: I mean
[21:59:34] <MetaNova> hypothetically
[21:59:44] <MetaNova> I can think of ways to work around this
[22:00:25] <polymorphic> Have a thin irc client always connected to the servers of choice that auto accept the DCC?
[22:00:42] <MetaNova> ....... very good, yes. very good!
[22:00:51] <polymorphic> Something like irssi, yeah. 
[22:01:19] <polymorphic> I primarily use Lounge, which doesn't support DCC at all, so that was my next plan, but wanted to see if znc could do something like that natively rather than using another IRC client.
[22:01:32] <MetaNova> just have weechat or irssi just auto-accept anything and it'll then sit on the server where that client is running, and you can dig through them at a later time
[22:01:45] <MetaNova> and then maybe use a better protocol to download locally
[22:01:58] <MetaNova> like ftp. or ftps, or sftp
[22:02:14] <MetaNova> or ffs rsync or [rambling continues]
[22:02:41] <MetaNova> polymorphic: AFAIK ZNC cannot do what you want here, specifically, on its own
[22:02:55] <MetaNova> short of you writing a script/module for it to do so

[22:27:30] <MetaNova> polymorphic: with a VPS, though, instead of that fortress made of twigs, why not just
[22:27:31] <MetaNova> like
[22:27:54] <MetaNova> run an FTP server with write-only permissions and a strict disk quota?
[22:28:43] <MetaNova> "send the files to UnprivilegedUser@my.awesome.domain:21/dumpbox/
[22:28:45] <MetaNova> or whatever
[22:29:43] <MetaNova> and if you say "because the hot files I want only seem to be shared via XDCC" I'm going to roll my eyes so hard
[22:29:59] <MetaNova> you may need to help me catch them as they roll across the floor towards the staircase
[22:31:42] <polymorphic> Haha, well, I already have a pretty robust automation system, but was trying to handle the one off things that may only be found or are pretty small that would only exist via IRC/DCC networks.
[22:31:53] <polymorphic> So this wasn't the highest priority on my list of things. :) 
[22:32:05] <polymorphic> Just wanted to see if it was possible without too much fuss from the client side.
[22:34:18] <MetaNova> you can just not use bouncedcc (or dcc, for that matter, because it's even _less_ relevant) and just keep an irssi instance attached to your ZNC at all times
[22:34:29] <MetaNova> and just let it auto-accept DCC stuff
[22:34:54] <MetaNova> that way you don't even need to worry about fetching it from the VPS later
[22:35:11] <MetaNova> unless part of the point is to hide your home IP or something
[22:37:23] <MetaNova> in which case I'd sooner suggest: /msg *controlpanel ADDCTCP $me DCC DCC IS DEAD, LET IT STAY DEAD, SEND ME A DROPBOX/GDRIVE/MEGA/SENDGB LINK INSTEAD YOU FSCKING CAVEMAN
