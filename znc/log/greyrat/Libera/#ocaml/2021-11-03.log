[15:50:06] <d_bot> <Président daren le pétrolier> hi, do you know the reason why you can't partially apply a constructor in OCaml ?
[15:50:44] <d_bot> <Président daren le pétrolier> to make things like ``"bar" |> Foo``
[15:54:34] <theblatte> constructors are not functions so you cannot use them as you would functions
[15:55:15] <d_bot> <octachron> In particular, constructors are guaranteed to be pure and they can have an arity different from one.
[15:56:29] <d_bot> <Président daren le pétrolier> thanks for your answers, so it's more a design choice than a performance concern ?

[16:05:52] <d_bot> <octachron> It is a design choice to have syntax reflects performance concerns and a constraint imposed by the value restriction which implies that `cons x xs` and `x::xs` may not have the same type.

[18:01:33] <octachron> and for stack-overflow, it seems that we will have also have increased default stack size in 4.14.

[18:01:58] <companion_cube> for some programs it makes sense to use very large stacks
[18:02:03] <companion_cube> cause making things tailrec is infeasible
[18:03:15] <octachron> the stack size will still be adjustable dynamically from the OS

[18:24:09] <zozozo> well...
[18:24:46] <zozozo> i'd have to try, but it wouldn't surprise me if there wre some instances of smtlib problems which are, pathological (e.g. a sequence of around 1M let-bindings, or more...)

[18:25:06] <companion_cube> I'd be surprised
[18:25:16] <companion_cube> 1M let bindings still means 1M _distinct_ terms
[18:25:26] <companion_cube> that seems like a lot, even for a SMT solver :)
[18:25:34] <d_bot> <mbacarella> ah, here we go: https://github.com/avsm/hello-world-action-ocaml
[18:26:52] <zozozo> companion_cube: do not underestimate the craziness of some problmes (which can be around hundreds of Mo of text...)
[18:27:48] <companion_cube> I know
[18:27:50] <companion_cube> but still :p
[18:28:41] <zozozo> I'll have to try and do a statistics pass on the smtlib at one time, to get detailed numbers (such as max depths, max size, etc...)
[18:30:23] <companion_cube> yeah that'd be interesting
[18:38:19] <d_bot> <undu> @pilothole please read the more up-to-date https://github.com/ocaml/setup-ocaml/#usage
[18:41:40] <d_bot> <mbacarella> yes i was. it linked me to that as a minimum test case 🙂

[21:00:04] <d_bot> <darrenldl> is m4 good for code gen?
[21:00:56] <companion_cube> afaict m4 is good for absolutely nothing
[21:01:05] <d_bot> <darrenldl> oh
[21:01:08] <d_bot> <darrenldl> : D
[21:02:47] <d_bot> <darrenldl> a project of similar scale/scope is relying on m4 for a lot of macro ish stuff, and i was wondering why havent they gone with writing code gen in haskell (they built the prover in haskell) but in m4 instead

[21:14:44] <d_bot> <mseri> I think there are premade examples in the setup-ocaml repo
[21:15:20] <d_bot> <mseri> You can make it much shorter than what you see there
[21:17:02] <d_bot> <mseri> Oh yes, what @undu said
[21:24:18] <companion_cube> @darrendl your project is a prover too?
