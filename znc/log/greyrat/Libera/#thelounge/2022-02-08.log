[12:06:38] <fnutt> Regarding #4282 - the PR makes username greyed out when set on mute in the network list. I like it.
[12:06:52] *** Joins: persephones[m] (~persephon@2001:470:69fc:105::1:602d)
[12:07:04] <fnutt> However, when you set a user on ignore, either through contect menu or with command /ignore, it does nothing.
[12:07:51] <fnutt> I'm wondering if we should find a way to indicate both methods in a propper manner.
[12:08:42] <bookworm> it has no real relation to a user... it simply greys out the channel name which happens to be the user in a query
[12:08:57] <fnutt> Yeah
[12:09:06] <fnutt> But what about when you set a user to ignore?
[12:09:07] <bookworm> if you see the nick anywhere else it looks normal, it also won't treat it any different
[12:09:16] <bookworm> then close the query?
[12:09:18] <fnutt> Fair enough.
[12:09:26] <fnutt> It does not close the query.
[12:09:29] <bookworm> they won't be able to send anything to you in any case
[12:09:44] <bookworm> of course not, it's expected that you do that
[12:09:49] <fnutt> I just tried to see if that actually happen.
[12:10:00] <bookworm> a client should never automatically close things
[12:10:12] <fnutt> I agree.
[12:10:30] <fnutt> But it's not visible to me at all if I have a user set on ignore or not.
[12:10:51] <fnutt> It's fairly easy to see if I have a user set on mute, if I have a query open with that user.
[12:11:05] <bookworm> you can't see them, what's the point?
[12:11:20] <fnutt> I think I'm missing some sort of control panel or whatever... where stuff like this is listed.
[12:11:29] <bookworm> if you ignore someone chances are that you close the query as there was a reason you've blocked them right?
[12:11:36] <fnutt> So it's easier to get some sort of overview of what has been done.
[12:11:44] <bookworm> right click on the network
[12:11:51] <bookworm> list ignored users
[12:11:59] <fnutt> Fair.
[12:12:05] <fnutt> What about mutes?
[12:12:22] <bookworm> you can see those in the chan list
[12:12:41] <fnutt> Well... maybe you cannot mute a user which you does not have an open query with.
[12:12:55] <bookworm> mute only mutes pings
[12:13:08] <bookworm> why would you mute someone that doesn't talk to you?
[12:13:29] <fnutt> Can you send me a pm please?
[12:13:38] <bookworm> muting a nick query won't prevent the same nick from pinging you in here
[12:13:39] <fnutt> I just closed the query.
[12:13:49] *** Quits: domicron (~domicron@gateway/tor-sasl/domicron) (Remote host closed the connection)
[12:13:57] <bookworm> it's literally muting that single channel or query
[12:14:36] *** Joins: domicron (~domicron@gateway/tor-sasl/domicron)
[12:14:37] <fnutt> I see. When I close the query it resets the mutes.
[12:14:39] <bookworm> it isn't meant to serve as a "this user is not allowed to ping me anywhere flag"
[12:14:55] <fnutt> I guess we have /ignore for that.
[12:14:59] <bookworm> yes
[12:15:17] <bookworm> although it can be a useful feature
[12:15:26] <bookworm> but as is that's not in scope
[12:16:02] <fnutt> Anyway, the PR is tested and seems to work. Checked all the special channels I could find. :)
[12:16:58] <bookworm> yeah, john and I also have the PR in our active instance... although I didn't yet merge the latest changes
[12:17:09] <bookworm> and didn't actively try to break it either
[12:17:19] <fnutt> Hmm... does it mute on server or the client?
[12:17:35] <bookworm> but at least #linux isn't constantly pinging me so that's good ;P
[12:17:57] <bookworm> it's synchronized over all clients
[12:17:58] <fnutt> In other words - if I mute a query on my computer, is the query muted on my phone as well?
[12:18:01] <fnutt> Good.
[12:18:03] <bookworm> yes
[12:18:29] <fnutt> Haha. Is the #linux channel spammy?

[14:14:36] <bookworm> well for sharing we have irc:// urls in theory that are understood by many clients. Depends a bit on what you'd like to use it for. Meaning if you want to cater to people who just browse some website (and you'd like to hide the orc part) or if you cater to people who know what irc is
[14:14:53] <bookworm> irc*
[14:16:14] <bookworm> for most "here's my irc room for the project" the irc url scheme should be used so that it opens in the preferred client of whoever clicks on it
[14:17:21] <bookworm> the problem there is a bit that not everyone has an irc client nowdays... there was some discussion in #ircv3 how to handle that... Might be worth looking into the solution emersion picked for the sr.ht bouncer
[14:18:18] *** Quits: genera (~Genera@user/genera) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[14:23:22] <fnutt> irc:// isn't useful when you have A LOT of scouts all around the world using webchat.scoutlink.net
[14:23:49] <fnutt> on their own and rented/borrowed computers etc.
[14:28:13] <bookworm> sure, conferences have similar desires... All of my networks are a single host though so I have an apt interest that this isn't getting worse either. I'm sure there's a way but one has to be a bit careful not to make either case worse
[14:30:23] <bookworm> and the problem with a TL specific workaround is just that, that it would be something special to TL. Especially for conferences it would really be better to respect the choice of client from the user rather than enforcing a website, but this makes it less easy to use for people who haven't setup such a handler
[14:30:30] <bookworm> as always, a tradeoff

[18:06:31] <vxxii> Hi, I've setup thelounge on an ubuntu instance on aws using the latest stable .deb, got it working with a domain i own on port 9000, i then set up ssl using certbot which succeded in generating key and certificate. I then edited the config to https enable: true and paths to key and certificate -on restarting thelounge service, or starting it via
[18:06:31] <vxxii> sudo -u thelounge thelounge start I get the following error: 'Path to SSL key is invalid. Stopping server...'
[18:06:39] <vxxii> I have pointed set the paths correctly so far as I can tell. I've googled the error; I'm hoping someone can point me at the next thing I should be looking at -or tell me if i've made a stupid assumption somewhere.
[18:07:59] <bookworm> check if the thelounge user can actually read the certs
[18:08:12] <bookworm> also it's better to use a reverse proxy

[18:14:18] <vxxii> mm. when I try to su thelounge I get 'This account is currently not available.' however I can issue commands via 'sudo -u thelounge thelounge something' -seems likely this is a part of my problem
[18:17:26] <vxxii> and the letsencrypt stuff is in /etc and set to root:root 
[18:18:42] <bookworm> I explicitly mentioned sudo for that reason... thelounge is a system user and login is generally disabled for those
[18:19:07] <bookworm> but the certs only being readable by root is your problem then
[18:20:15] <vxxii> yes, I see now -thanks for your help. I'm sure I can get it from here.
[18:21:23] <vxxii> once I get this working I'll then figure out reverse proxy to try and do this correctly
[18:22:10] <xnaas> For absolute simplicity, I can say that caddy is braindead easy.
[18:23:19] <vxxii> cheers. I'll look at it.
