[01:23:03] <kronk> can anybody recommend a simple multi-bay drive enclosure? doesn't even have to support RAID, I just want something that isn't a NAS or a full PC.

[03:51:19] <kronk> it gives off an aesthetic that I absolutely dig. it's like a steam deck without the controls.

[20:46:26] <gwozniak> 'morning
[20:47:17] <kline> gwozniak, what was the toot about the bouncer about
[20:47:35] <kline> not to tell you youre wrong, im just interested in how complex your irc is
[20:47:42] <gwozniak> the intense annoyance that has resulted in trying to get ZNC to work
[20:47:49] <gwozniak> Which it now is, finally
[20:48:57] <gwozniak> It was a confluence of things: ERC being broken without realizing it, SSL giving me headaches, TERM variables wreaking havoc
[20:49:08] <kline> rip
[20:49:13] <kline> i need to reboot znc
[20:49:31] <kline> debian delivered an update and now all the modules have versions strings that worry the core
[20:49:56] <kline> it wont load modules with the wrong version incase they are abi incompatible and core the server
[20:52:40] <kline> but on the other hand, my idlerpg score
[20:58:24] <gwozniak> Gonna try out the bouncer for a while since a friend of mine gave me some credit on DigitalOcean
[21:00:52] <river> gwozniak: easier solution may be glowing bear + weechat over ssh relay
[21:03:51] <gwozniak> I just wanted to see what it's like to set this up
[21:04:02] <river> oh i could have saved you the trouble: not fun
[21:04:21] <river> i guess znc is fine but it uses IRC protocol as the control for IRC
[21:04:26] <gwozniak> I'm not terribly interested in the advantages of a bouncer
[21:04:29] <river> which works.. but it is fundamentally in-band signalling
[21:04:44] <gwozniak> There is a web interface, which is better
[21:04:56] <gwozniak> I tried the IRC interface and it kind of sucks
[21:05:39] <gwozniak> It's okay for some simple get/set stuff
[21:07:03] <river> jesus the flatpak people are insane
[21:13:27] <kline> 3rd party packaging projects in general seem to be full of deranged people and SV monopolise-the-market types
[21:13:51] <gwozniak> What's going on now?

[21:17:02] <buttsbot> Screenshot 2022 04 02 17 46 44 — Postimages
[21:19:30] <river> also the 3 github issues about ~/.var/ breaking XDG
[21:28:12] <gwozniak> Something about that response seems off...
[21:28:24] <gwozniak> So hard to put my finger on it!
[21:28:25] <river> hey debian, i cant build some random github repo ya shmucks. what the hell are ya doing?
[21:29:13] <river> https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_Base_Directory#Flatpak these 3 wontfixes are related to the problem im having
[21:29:14] <buttsbot> XDG Base Directory - ArchWiki
[21:47:13] <kronk> why use flatpak anyway.
[21:52:11] <gwozniak> The better half is out this evening and staying overnight at a friend's place, so I get to be the tech bachelor for the night
[21:52:17] <gwozniak> I might get pizza
[22:00:37] <kronk> get some freaky pizza. like indian fusion pizza.
[22:11:17] <kronk> I really need to get rid of this fucking synology NAS.
[22:11:33] <kronk> it's nice for some people. not for me. something simpler would be nice.
[22:18:20] <gwozniak> I have two of these and they are nice: https://www.newegg.com/p/14G-028N-00001

[22:30:35] <kronk> I might just go whole-hog and build a tiny PC with an AMD APU.
[22:30:42] <kronk> and just use that as a homebrew NAS.
[22:31:01] <kronk> ZFS on everything, restic backups.
[22:31:05] <kronk> the works.
[22:34:07] <kronk> first things first, I need a case.
[22:59:03] <epilys[m]> what's bad about Synology btw? I was looking  at getting one
[23:00:07] <kronk> just that it's not a.. shall I say it, vanilla *nix.
[23:00:31] <kronk> like it's configured in the weirdest ways. I want to configure restic backups for my NAS.
[23:00:45] <kronk> but Synology wants you to use _their_ CloudSync solution.

[23:14:55] <kronk> as intended.
[23:15:06] <epilys[m]> kronk: you can't run custom OS on Synology?
[23:15:16] <kronk> epilys[m]: not really.
[23:15:25] <epilys[m]> deal-breaker.
[23:16:14] <kronk> yeah. I bought it because I needed some cheap and quick storage options for backing up really old shit drives.
[23:16:21] <kronk> but now I need an actual, y'know, computer.
[23:16:30] <kronk> that doesn't try to mount and analyze anything I slot into the USB slot.
[23:16:50] <kronk> like I wanna take an image of a drive, not mount it and mess with the modified dates!
[23:22:55] <epilys[m]> I want to finally get my LTO4 drive attached to a pc and start tape archiving
[23:24:00] <gwozniak> I think I looked at Synology a while ago and wasn't all that enthralled with it
[23:30:55] <defect> i have a semi-old synology and i'm pretty happy with it. don't use it all that much but it's trucking on
[23:31:01] <defect> until it doesn't, i guess
[23:34:15] <kronk> can we fucking stop adding RGB to motherboards.
[23:34:41] <kronk> I wanna stick RGB LEDs inside the eyelids of whoever thought this was a good idea.
[23:34:45] <kronk> and set them to strobe at 60hz.
[23:49:47] <kronk> I wish pcpartpicker had an option for "no RGB", because it's absolutely ridiculous that everything needs to be "GAMING" and "RAINBOW VOMIT" these days.
[23:49:53] <kronk> I want a NAS motherboard. not a lightshow.
