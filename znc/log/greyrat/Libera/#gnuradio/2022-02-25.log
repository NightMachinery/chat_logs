[00:35:56] <DerekKozel[m]> <l4rrybr3nt[m]> "hm, can I loop through a few..." <- Yes, but probably you will need to write a few lines of python
[00:36:07] <bpadalino> apparently bindtool puts an FSF copyright at the top of the resulting generated files and states it's part of GNU Radio - is this really what should be happening ?
[00:36:43] <bpadalino> https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/blob/b2c9623cbd548bd86250759007b80b61bd4a2a06/gr-utils/bindtool/templates/license.mako - here's the license template .. and where it's invoked - https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/blob/b2c9623cbd548bd86250759007b80b61bd4a2a06/gr-utils/bindtool/templates/generic_python_cc.mako#L15
[00:37:30] <LordKalma> bpadalino probably yes, that's correct
[00:37:49] <LordKalma> even GCC's license has an explicit exception that what it outputs is *not* covered by its license as a derivative work
[00:38:13] <bpadalino> DerekKozel[m]: can you look at my question regarding gr-uhd and rfnoc_block_generic being used but not exposed in the python?
[00:41:54] <DerekKozel[m]> bpadalino: I see your question, but I don't know the answer
[00:42:00] <bpadalino> LordKalma: sounds like a mostly bs argument - https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#GPLOutput .. they're bindings
[00:42:12] <bpadalino> DerekKozel[m]: so should i submit it as a bug or ... ?
[00:42:41] <DerekKozel[m]> Your explaination seems plausibe though
[00:44:20] <DerekKozel[m]> Yes please file a bug. We'll ask Aaron or Martin to look at it

[00:50:54] <bpadalino> ok
[00:51:24] <DerekKozel[m]> Yes. I agree with you. That seems pretty clear cut that https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/blob/maint-3.10/gr-uhd/include/gnuradio/uhd/rfnoc_block_generic.h needs binding

[00:55:28] <bpadalino> issue submitted: https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/issues/5612
[00:55:58] <LordKalma> SWIG also has such exception iirc
[00:56:04] <LordKalma> because it's also a spitter of code
[00:59:09] <DerekKozel[m]> Thanks for the tip. As long as there's good previous history of other projects following that pattern we'll probably follow the lead.
[00:59:39] <LordKalma> http://www.swig.org/legal.html

[01:00:08] <LordKalma> "code copied from the SWIG library which is permissively licensed to be redistributed without restriction"
[01:00:38] <LordKalma> they explicitly give a liberal license to the internal templates that end up in output
[01:01:14] <LordKalma> "code generated by SWIG, which is not governed by copyright" // which goes in hand with bpadalino's comment
[01:01:33] <LordKalma> but the other point I mentioned definitely applies here, I'd say
[01:02:48] <DerekKozel[m]> Yes, it's the GPL licensed template code being copied into the output that has me most thoughtful.
[01:03:19] <LordKalma> if that code in particular has do dependencies, it's possible to just put a licensing bubble around it
[01:03:42] <bpadalino> i am not sure what you're arguing for LordKalma 
[01:04:11] <LordKalma> bpadalino if a program's output copy-pastes from some file with a copy-left license, your output is copy-left
[01:04:19] <LordKalma> no "but"s
[01:04:37] <LordKalma> insert patchvonbraun[m] for comedic relief about bottoms
[01:06:32] <bpadalino> so then its a question if DerekKozel[m] wants every module ever made with modtool to be copyright to the FSF .. or wants to try to claim that it is
[01:06:39] <bpadalino> which honestly sounds like bullshit
[01:07:15] <DerekKozel[m]> A portion of the code of every module made by modtool could well be copyright the FSF.
[01:07:40] <LordKalma> bpadalino we're discussing that exact point
[01:07:46] <LordKalma> it's very much their right 
[01:07:52] <LordKalma> that's what you get with copy-left
[01:08:54] <LordKalma> the probject would have to explicitly relicense the template to MIT-0, Unlicense, or Apache, or similar.
[01:08:58] <DerekKozel[m]> I think bpadalino understands that. It's more of a question of is that the desire and intent of the project to have that, and to make sure that the author of the module is also getting their copyright recognized
[01:09:06] <bpadalino> making output from modtool copyright the FSF sounds like a terrible position to have
[01:09:46] <bpadalino> you have a convenience tool to help people develop using your tool .. on top of that, it's practically impossible to enforce
[01:10:11] <LordKalma> I perfecly agree it's not ideal
[01:10:16] <LordKalma> probably never discussed (?)
[01:10:49] <bpadalino> just bringing it up .. as i was surprised to see a module i wanted to write and use the bindtool was all of a sudden not mine
[01:11:05] <LordKalma> yeah, very interesting point
[01:11:14] <LordKalma> and should definitely be addressed
[01:11:14] <DerekKozel[m]> It isn't a position. Its legal necessity if the FSF is the copyright holder of the code in the template and if there isn't a basis to say that the output of the templating is a new work not covered by the previous copyright
[01:11:20] <DerekKozel[m]> I'll check on when that template was last rewritten, and if at that time it was replaced in a way that isn't a derivative work of the FSF's copyrighted work. We cannot unilaterally relicense the code
[01:12:07] <LordKalma> the FSF, as copyright owner, can relicense it at any point
[01:12:12] <DerekKozel[m]> But we can certainly clarify what of the outputted code is from the template
[01:12:13] <LordKalma> not any random dev, of course
[01:13:05] <DerekKozel[m]> Yes
[01:13:08] <DerekKozel[m]> :)
[01:13:45] <DerekKozel[m]> I'll look into it and see what we can do to clarify that it is only the templated code which (might) be copyright the FSF, not any code written by the module author
[01:14:25] <bpadalino> not only that, but the module is stated as being part of GNU Radio ..
[01:14:53] <LordKalma> GPL projects ought to say what they are a part of so you can track the derivative work chain
[01:16:59] <DerekKozel[m]> Yep. I'll take a look at the output of gr_modtool and bindtool's templates and see what's accurate, what's required, and what can be better stated
[01:17:54] <tnt> DerekKozel[m]: based on the "grant back" clause, if the dev(s) of the code agreed, I think you could relicense. (or rather re-release under another license since each author can do whatever they want with their work).
[01:17:56] <DerekKozel[m]> Thanks for pointing them out. 
[01:18:38] <DerekKozel[m]> tnt: Yep. And the bindtool pieces are quite new, very few authors.
[01:19:11] <DerekKozel[m]> VOLK's relicensing to LGPL using exactly that method is almost complete
[01:20:16] <DerekKozel[m]> A few more authors though! 60+ folks have confirmed resubmitting their code under LGPL now
[01:20:27] <LordKalma> does GnuRadio have a CLA?
[01:20:35] <tnt> yes
[01:20:37] <LordKalma> CLAs really help when this kind of issue arises
[01:20:45] <tnt> but to the FSF
[01:20:46] <DerekKozel[m]> No
[01:20:51] <DerekKozel[m]> We no longer use the CLA
[01:20:52] <tnt> (well it used to ...)
[01:20:55] <LordKalma> does the CLA include wavering rights of contributors?
[01:20:57] <LordKalma> oh okay then
[01:21:01] <DerekKozel[m]> It did for a very long time. Now we use the Developer Certificate of Origin
[01:21:23] <LordKalma> what I've been contributing to lately is Conan. They have a CLA for me to wave copyright to them.
[01:21:50] <LordKalma> well, if one hand requires me to trust them, on the other hand, these kinds of issues can be solved without tracking back contributors haha
[01:22:25] <DerekKozel[m]> CLAs can make some things easier. They also have downsides practically and philosophically (and like most philosophical things there's much room to have different thoughts).
[01:22:57] <LordKalma> well, we're talking about GPL here. it has a very strict philosophy that's probably not aligned with anything I just said
[01:23:05] <LordKalma> it's all about *not* waiving away rights
[01:23:16] <DerekKozel[m]> Yes no yes :)
[01:23:33] <DerekKozel[m]> Laws suck and are messy
[01:23:53] <LordKalma> and programmers don't have enough information to deal with them
[01:23:56] <DerekKozel[m]> Copyleft is a hack to embody a philosophy.
[01:24:10] <tnt> heh tbh I think the main problem with the GR CLA was that it was to the FSF rather than a gnuradio specific entity ...
[01:24:14] <LordKalma> it's interesting to think about it. Computer science and engineering should definitely have a legal course
[01:24:55] <DerekKozel[m]> I was lucky. Mine did. several semesters of law, public policy, and how engineering affects and is affected by it.
[01:25:03] <LordKalma> we produce copyrightable content all day long and don't even think of it as that
[01:25:19] <LordKalma> haha don't get me started on the "affected by"
[01:25:41] <DerekKozel[m]> Or someone works for the US government and their work is entirely devoid of copyright status
[01:25:46] <LordKalma> I'm a PhD student. I had a *strong* disagreement with like a senior researcher everybody jerks off to at work couple month ago in a conference
[01:25:48] <DerekKozel[m]> Which is an interesting edgecase
[01:26:20] <DerekKozel[m]> Where are you studying? and what?
[01:26:20] <LordKalma> by the absolute liminal rejection she had when I asked questions about ensuring ethical usage of her work
[01:27:18] <LordKalma> she works in mesh networking, and smart cities tech, basically, gov surveillance at scale. I asked her in front of a public how do you draw the line between utopia and distopia 
[01:27:27] <LordKalma> she told me to fuck off respectably 
[01:27:29] <LordKalma> so fuck that
[01:27:48] <LordKalma> but yeah, everybody almost masturbates to just her name around there. for me, zero respect.
[01:27:54] <tnt> Tip of the day ... in some countries (at least Belgium :p) if your work output is copyrightable, and its copyright is assigned to the employer, part of your revenue can be taxed at a lower rate if you declare it as such ...
[01:28:18] <LordKalma> interesting!
[01:28:29] <LordKalma> DerekKozel[m] I work in photonics myself
[01:28:45] <LordKalma> none of that networking crap
[01:29:17] <DerekKozel[m]> I'm doing work on RF power amplifiers at Cardiff University for my studies. A few orders of magnitude longer lambdas
[01:29:43] <LordKalma> hahah my work with deals with RF over fibre technology in some sense 
[01:30:03] <LordKalma> well, we prefer microwave photonics since radio-over-fibre is more associated to transport

[17:52:14] <jesusp[m]> Hello! I'm trying to start making gnuradio flowgraph directly using python code. I put a simple signal source and qt time sink. My goal is try to change the amplitude of the signal source during runtime. I set the amplitude making and executing "set_amp()" function. This change the variable, but it doesnt change the amplitude of my signal source. How can I do this? I let here the test code.
[17:52:15] <jesusp[m]> https://github.com/LittleDisnomia/Change-Values.git
[17:57:06] <Myon> jesusp[m]: create that flowgraph in gnuradio-companion and have a look how the set_amp function looks in the generated python code there
[17:58:36] <jesusp[m]> Okay Myon I think I read your mind haha. I literally do that and I know how to do it. Thank you all!

[18:02:49] <funkylab[m]> jesusp:  also note that this, to me, really sounds as if you might want to describe more precisely *when* you want to change the amplitude: after some time has passed? After some external event? Or after a fixed number of samples?
[18:03:31] <funkylab[m]> also, remark regarding your flow graph: this will process samples as fast as possible, and just eat at least one CPU core. Probably not what you wanted!
[18:06:40] <jesusp[m]> Yes! Maybe I need to put a throttle block. I want to change the amplitude with an external event. Create QPushButton and connect with the function where I'm going to define "signal_source.set_ampliitude(amp)" on it or something like that. It's only to learn how this works.
[18:11:55] <funkylab[m]> nice!
[18:13:13] <funkylab[m]> Hm, I do have recommendations for that, which are different than just using the `set_amplitude` method, but I think doing that is a good start, and I don't want to overburden you with technicalities yet. 
[18:14:42] <funkylab[m]> however, if, now or later on, any of this tells you something: you should probably use the SIGNAL from the QWidget to `_post` a PMT to the "cmd" message port of the signal source, containing a dictionary of `ampl` mapping to the floating point amplitude you want
[18:15:15] <funkylab[m]> but for now, just call the `set_amplitude` when receiving the clicked event from the button
[18:23:46] <jesusp[m]> Aaah, I read something about that. But I have a question with that. For example, in the OOT modules or other modules that don't have message port how can I change the values if I dont have the set function on it? I think that is more complex than a simlpe question I did before haha.
[18:26:04] <jesusp[m]> Anyway, thnks for the help, I've already made a lot of progress.

[18:45:18] <funkylab[m]> <jesusp[m]> "Aaah, I read something about..." <- if a block has no interface, neither a setter method nor some message handler for it, then you plain and simply can't change a property.
[19:01:26] <jesusp[m]> Ok, that make sense. Thanks!
[19:05:20] <funkylab[m]> heh, by the way, if you have a block where you think such an interface is missing, but logical (there's things where it makes less sense), drop everyone a message here to discuss it and/or (actually, you can also directly do that, but sometime's there's good alternatives) open up a feature request.

[20:10:05] <bpadalino> not gnuradio related, but i wonder if people have any suggestions for visualizing a large spectral data set .. i have 1ms snapshots over at least a 15 minute range that i'd like to be able to zoom in/out and annotate .. this is data at rest and not live streaming coming in .. the data is already translated to the frequency domain, but the visualization is killing me
[20:10:46] <Yamakaja[m]> Mhm, if it was IQ data i'd have suggested inspectrum
[20:10:49] <Yamakaja[m]> Not sure about pre-processed data
[20:11:08] <bpadalino> so i converted it to IQ to try inspectrum, but it doesn't allow me to zoom all the way out
[20:11:32] <Yamakaja[m]> How many GB are we talking about?
[20:11:41] <DerekKozel[m]> baudline
[20:11:42] <bpadalino> not lots of GB, but 256x977k
[20:11:49] <DerekKozel[m]> It's designed for TB datasets
[20:11:50] <bpadalino> baudline segfaults when consuming the data
[20:12:00] <DerekKozel[m]> ah...
[20:12:47] <DerekKozel[m]> And you said spectral. Hmm. I don't know any tools that natively work with that
[20:14:01] <Yamakaja[m]> What format is your spectral data in? Just a 2d array of power floats?
[20:14:10] <bpadalino> yeah, seems like everyone wants to do their own fft .. but i already have it in the frequency domain .. though i did spend some time turning the spectral plots back into iq so other tools can work with it
[20:14:12] <muaddib[m]> I’ve did a side project like that. Matplotlib/pyplot worked well for that.
[20:14:33] <muaddib[m]> That was gonna be my suggestion
[20:14:41] <bpadalino> Yamakaja[m]: actually int8, so mag dB rounded to 1 dB

[20:15:01] <Yamakaja[m]> I see
[20:15:36] <bpadalino> muaddib[m]: how much data did you pass into matplotlib/pyplot ?
[20:15:37] <Yamakaja[m]> I suppose trying a plt.imshow can't hurt, but that's going to produce a huge image and at that point you've got an image viewing problem :D

If you put an XMLRPC server block in an existing flowgraph, it will automatically expose every variable in the flowgraph on the server. Then you can just call xmlrpc_client.set_amp(<value>). I wrote a tutorial about it on the wiki here called “remote control and automation of flowgraphs using XMLRPC”

[20:25:05] <funkylab[m]> but the problem is quite practically that a lot of our setters are inconsistent / thread unsafe / not existent
[20:25:28] <Notou[m]> Yes, you may be able to use matplotlib `imgshow` for that. 
[20:25:28] <Notou[m]> I know that if you use a jupyter(lab) notebook, you can activate `%matplotlib widget` at the beginning to allow interactions, and zooming all the way inside.

[23:43:44] <warnes[m]> Q: What is required to use a single antenna for both TX and RX?  
[23:46:01] <tnt> Either a switch, a duplexer or a circulator ... depends on the case.
[23:46:47] <warnes[m]> I would like to experiment with WiFi over long distances.
[23:47:19] <warnes[m]> .. using a pair of bladeRF xA9's.
[23:48:05] <tnt> usually for wifi you'd use a switch that toggle between RX and TX depending if you're TX'ing.
