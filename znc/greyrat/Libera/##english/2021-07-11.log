[02:15:18] <gneeriiloeepdeer> can you help me find the name of a movie?
[02:15:39] <gneeriiloeepdeer> it's from the 80s, a part 2 was made, it's an african movie (maybe original language Afrikaans?)
[02:16:01] <gneeriiloeepdeer> it's about a native african looking for his son, a 3 or 4 year old
[02:16:31] <gneeriiloeepdeer> the movie is situated in the cold war, which means there are cuban militias and government soldiers chasing each other
[02:16:38] <gneeriiloeepdeer> lions and hyenas, baboons too
[02:16:58] <gneeriiloeepdeer> there is also a white couple, a female teacher I believe and a male pilot with a very small portable plane
[02:17:12] <gneeriiloeepdeer> they get lost in the desert and meet the small child, I believ
[02:17:13] <gneeriiloeepdeer> e
[02:17:27] <gneeriiloeepdeer> but in the end is the father who, following the trail, finds his son
[02:17:39] <tinwhiskers> Not the Gods must be crazy, I guess?
[02:17:59] <gneeriiloeepdeer> in this movie, armored cars are strange elephants (for the African father)
[02:18:21] <gneeriiloeepdeer> I ask here because I watched the movie dubbed in English

[02:43:51] <MetaNova> I only remember that a coke bottle's rim hit someone on the forehead and left an imprint, that they were African, and that a white person was the reason the coke bottle was there
[02:43:55] <MetaNova> nothing else

[04:24:55] <gneeriiloeepdeer> we have constructed a complex society, yet it has strange and illogical outcomes, plain stupid some of them. Each time a legislative body enacts a statue and it gets published in the official gazette, the construction implies that every citizen in the country knows the approved law, because claiming that you don't know a law is no reason not to follow it
[04:26:03] <gneeriiloeepdeer> nobody in his sane mind knows every enacted law. In fact, to know a bit about laws you have to study for several years, and after that you have to pass the bar
[04:27:27] <gneeriiloeepdeer> it was worse when Empires expanded: you would have a peasant somewhere sddenly forced to obey different laws or topay new taxes, just because soldiers of a different army camped near him

[09:15:09] <toretto> Ok, here is the accurate one: "Some people, such as Jacob and John, think this way"
[09:15:26] <toretto> In this specific case and context, do I need to use "or" or "and"?
[09:16:02] <rindolf> twb: BTW, have you read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy  ? the books are funny and really crazy
[09:16:03] <toretto> The context is same as I said previously. Not just two of those people think this way, many do but I just wanna name a few.
[09:16:28] <twb> rindolf: yes I have read most of Adams's stuff
[09:16:36] <rindolf> twb: ah
[09:17:48] <rindolf> twb: my mashup screenplays are fairly crazy too
[09:17:51] <rcm888> I thing I've found a "bay guy" - the syntax error in word 'transcription'
[09:18:01] <rcm888> *think
[09:18:18] <rindolf> IMHO
[09:18:27] <twb> toretto: I think "and" because "people" is plural
[09:18:43] <twb> "Someone, such as Jacob or John, thinks this way"
[09:19:26] <rcm888> it should be trans scription , since trans ans script compose the word
[09:19:27] <rindolf> i recntly have been doing a lot of self-ref / strange loops
[09:19:55] <twb> rcm888: I don't understand what you are saying.
[09:20:19] <rcm888> sorry for typos. I have no light in my room...
[09:20:32] <twb> rindolf: "transcription" is a valid English word.  It refers to copying something over (trans-) from one script to another.  For example, Latin to Cyrillic.
[09:21:05] <rcm888> twb: it ought to be transscription
[09:21:19] <twb> That's just elision
[09:21:36] <twb> But I can see your logical argument now
[09:21:50] <rcm888> because scribe/script and trans, but not the "tran"
[09:22:04] <rindolf> a la https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Action_Hero and stuff
[09:22:58] <rcm888> twb: it would be the same as to write acumulator instead of accumulator
[09:24:55] <twb> rcm888: how is that the same?
[09:25:16] <twb> ad- + cumulo
[09:25:25] <rcm888> ac-cept, ac-cord, ac-cumulate
[09:26:14] <twb> Oh, I think I see.

[21:19:10] <Guest9> is there any tool which can speak (TTS) both words (word & its translated word in another language) 
[21:25:15] <LjL> as much as i hate to suggest it, Google Translate does that, for a start... unless you need it to speak both *without human intervention*
[21:28:19] * blkshp tattoos a google logo on LjL.
[21:28:41] * LjL skins himself

[21:48:47] <pussipupu> Also worth noting that Google Translate isn't exactly trustworthy
[21:49:20] <pussipupu> (and that single single-word glosses are often not really useful anyway)
[21:49:36] <xerxes> Google Translate doesn't really work for non-European languages.
[21:50:23] <APic> *nod*
[21:51:13] <Guest9> LjL i need both
[21:51:16] <pussipupu> you could maybe scrape Wiktionary translations and feed them into some TTS

[22:11:20] <StayHungry> Evening, comrades
[22:11:31] <StayHungry> I'd like to know whether comma before or is used correctly as follows
[22:11:40] <StayHungry> Type number of disk, or press Ctrl+Break to quit
[22:12:00] <StayHungry> Is it obligatory, optional, or not not needed at all
[22:12:21] <blkshp> Hello StayHungry. I'd say optional.
[22:12:42] <StayHungry> in both cases? (a. Type... b. Is it obligatory...)
[22:13:07] <blkshp> I don't know what that's supposed to mean.
[22:13:19] <StayHungry> I gave two sentences :)
[22:13:25] <StayHungry> with ,or
[22:14:01] <blkshp> You gave one sentence unless was the "is it obligatory..." the second one?
[22:14:13] <StayHungry> yes, it is the second one
[22:14:45] <blkshp> i'd say the second, though also optional is better used than not.
[22:14:54] <blkshp> makes the sentence flow better.
[22:15:29] <StayHungry> because in my native language in both cases it is not needed at all, so i am a bit confused

[22:18:28] <xerxes> StayHungry: avoid 'em. too many commas can break the flow.
[22:19:45] <xerxes> i seem to remember there was a name to writing like that which is normally found in archaic English. is there?
[22:20:30] <blkshp> Well, there's the very necessary (sometimes) Oxford COmma.
[22:21:18] <Autoclesis> Oxford comma lesson.
[22:21:56] <blkshp> I went to the party and saw the strippers, Lenin and Trump.

[22:23:41] <blkshp> lol
[22:23:46] <StayHungry> in my native language there would be : after "strippers" and "parents"

[22:26:15] <StayHungry> in the end, flow advices contradict each other: blkship promotes commas, xerxes does not :)
[22:26:49] <LjL> both styles are used
[22:27:02] <LjL> there may be arguments for one or another, especially in certain situations
[22:27:21] <blkshp> In this instance, though it follows the rules of the oxford comma, it is not one where it makes the difference but I like to be in the habit.
[22:28:00] <StayHungry> thank you, comrades
[22:29:03] <LjL> blkshp, has anyone ever seriously made the argument that the Oxford comma is unnecessary and what should be rectified, instead, is that in a sentence where Lenin and Trump are the strippers, one should write "I went to the party and saw the strippers: Lenin and Trump"?
[22:29:19] <LjL> because if no one has, i'll go ahead and do it, just because i care about minorities
[22:29:24] <LjL> (namely the colon and semicolon)
[22:30:20] <xerxes> That the sun will not rise to-morrow is no less intelligible a proposition, and implies no contradiction, than the affirmation, that it will rise.
[22:30:51] <StayHungry> too many commas here, i agree :)
[22:31:07] <xerxes> this is from Hume. while this is a very simple sentence, there are many complex sentences which build up on clauses separated by commas. i forgot what this archaic style was called. :)
[22:31:26] <xerxes> not in Hume per se. it was just a style in earlier times.
[22:32:21] <blkshp> LjL: people argue everything.
[22:32:35] <LjL> people, argue everything!

[22:33:22] <StayHungry> by the way, ancient Egyptians perceived the sun as a god, who died by sunsets and reborn by sunrises
[22:33:31] <StayHungry> comma before who in the case, what do you think?
[22:33:39] <blkshp> LjL: you turned it into a command :)
[22:33:55] <xerxes> StayHungry: not necessary.

[22:35:58] <LjL> StayHungry, if you mean about the spacing, no. it's always "word, word" in English, never "word ,word"
[22:36:01] <xerxes> StayHungry: The English, like ancient medals, kept more apart, and passing but few people’s hands, preserve the first sharpnesses which the fine hand of Nature has given them;—they are not so pleasant to feel,—but in return the legend is so visible, that at the first look you see whose image and superscription they bear.
