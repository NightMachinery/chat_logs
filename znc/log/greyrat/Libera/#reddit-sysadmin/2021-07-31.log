[02:34:23] <mistiry> whats wrong with it
[02:34:42] <CoJaBo> I tried running the desktop version of Telegram, but our work firewall apparently only allows TCP, and Telegram refuses to TCP lol
[02:34:50] <CoJaBo> Everything is useless
[02:34:54] <JollyRgrs> hey @Hunterkll quick question... other than "tagging" a registry, any way to get some variable set outside of a config item for SCCM? I want to setup a detection/remediation script that has a variable which could be set by collection. I don't think collection variables can be used in a CI though, right?
[02:35:09] <mistiry> if everything was useless, do you honestly believe it would have gotten to the market share it is? 
[02:35:12] <mistiry> it works fine
[02:35:17] <JollyRgrs> CoJaBo: how much stock do you own in Reynolds?
[02:35:18] <CoJaBo> mistiry: It's useless to me
[02:35:24] <CoJaBo> JollyRgrs: I dunno what that is
[02:35:26] <mistiry> what doesnt work for you?
[02:35:43] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> JollyRgrs: I'd just drop a registry key ..... your detect/remediation script could detect if it needs to remediate.... then if it doesn't, check for reg key and drop that.... then check for your reg key before you run again or not
[02:35:47] <CoJaBo> mistiry: I can't get on Telegram at work, because they don't support tcp somehow

[02:36:00] <mistiry> CoJaBo: that has nothing to do with ANdroid being useless to you
[02:36:08] <mistiry> is work the only place you use your mobile?
[02:36:13] <CoJaBo> And I can't make a personal account, because they on't allow you to use a GVoice number to sign up, and that's all I have right now
[02:36:26] <mistiry> These are all self-inflicted problems
[02:36:30] <JollyRgrs> ^^
[02:36:31] <mistiry> Android isnt to blame for that
[02:36:44] <JollyRgrs> it sounds like CoJaBo showers and sleeps at work
[02:36:51] <CoJaBo> I'm not buying another phone to create an account. I have standards, you know
[02:37:00] <JollyRgrs> ... yeah... we can tell
[02:37:12] <mistiry> So dont use it then
[02:37:12] <JollyRgrs> just b/c you have standards don't mean they are the best ones
[02:37:25] <CoJaBo> JollyRgrs: We have a telegram account for the office for some reason, which is hilarious, becasue there's no way to sign into it
[02:37:28] <JollyRgrs> tell your friends to go use another platform that you can also use
[02:37:32] <JollyRgrs> if not, they aren't your friends really
[02:37:42] <CoJaBo> JollyRgrs: That's basically the gist, yeh.
[02:37:55] <CoJaBo> Hence why we've compromized on discord lol
[02:38:04] <JollyRgrs> or maybe you are not THEIR friend for making some very small concessions in order to chat with your friends

I've had girls jokingly ask to "Netflix and chill" but when I tell her that I don't use Netflix since Netflix requires proprietary software to stream content, they stop talking to me. And worse if they do stay they think I'm weird since I blocked google IP's in my host file
[02:38:22] <mistiry> and we can't even watch youtube. I can't ever seem to get girls to come over to my place and I can't text them either. Once I get their numbers since I've added customs roms to my phone and refuse to use sms since it's a security concern I require all of my friends to download a free and open source messaging app and I share with them my public gpg key so that we can verify that our
[02:38:24] <mistiry> conversations are secure. None of my friends are willing to do this. And I can't use sites like tinder since it's not only proprietary software but a major privacy vulnerability.

[22:19:50] <haise01> I'm waiting for prices to drop

[22:19:57] <sd> 04<P​ikachu> It's just the quad cores weren't memory starved back then so people weren't testing or taking about it
[22:20:00] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> i'm waiting for fucking DDR3 prices to drop again
[22:20:10] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> fuckin ram kits on ebay are double the damn price i'm used to
[22:20:31] <sd> 04<P​ikachu> But now, comparing Comet Lake and Zen 2+, the same gains for memory speed are seen on both
[22:20:33] <sd> 13<S​hocklance> have they stopped producing ddr3 in quantity like they used to?

[22:21:20] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> @Shocklance it's not quite that, but i mean, if you need hardware now..... and don't mind hitting the used market.... well, prices balloon up
[22:21:23] <sd> 04<P​ikachu> And both are for the same reason
[22:21:30] <sd> 04<P​ikachu> Though different causes
[22:21:49] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> less DDR3 RDIMMs on the market these days
[22:21:57] <sd> 13<S​hocklance> oh
[22:21:57] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> people buffing up existsing hardware to get by, etc
[22:21:59] <sd> 04<P​ikachu> Basically faster memory makes up for the increase in core to core latency increases over the years
[22:22:34] <haise01> thats limitation of their "CCX" architecture right ?
[22:22:41] <sd> 13<S​hocklance> yeah, that's not surprising either, having to stand up servers that would normally be decommed due to remote access etc
[22:22:42] <sd> 04<P​ikachu> Zen because of the chiplets, there is an increase of latency vs monolithic, which AMD alleviates by just throwing a shitonne of cache at it
[22:23:11] <sd> 04<P​ikachu> For Intel, they've been increasing core counts and thus, the ring bus gets longer and longer, increasing latency
[22:23:43] <sd> 04<P​ikachu> So, for both sides, there's huge performance gains to be had for having faster memory for recent generations
[22:24:32] <haise01> interesting, I am still stuck in 2017 regarding hardware lol
[22:24:45] <haise01> that was last time I did my homework properly when I was building new PC
[22:25:06] <sd> 04<P​ikachu> Zen 3 has the performance crown right now primarily because of the sheer amount of L3 cache available to each core, massively compensating for the much bigger core to core latency vs Intel's monolithic dies
[22:25:27] <sd> 04<P​ikachu> It's a sort of brute force attempt, but it's clearly working well
[22:25:58] <sd> 04<P​ikachu> And the inverse can be seen with Rocket Lake vs Comet Lake
[22:27:25] <sd> 04<P​ikachu> Where the extra instructions they bolted on and the increase in bus length due to backporting Willow Cove to 14nm meant that in anything that's latency sensitive (eg high frame rate games), it's got a performance regression vs Comet Lake
[22:27:39] <sd> 04<P​ikachu> But the delta can be reduced by throwing faster memory at it
[22:28:25] <sd> 04<P​ikachu> Core to core latency is what killed them and the main reason why most of the reviewers are calling Rocket Lake a waste of sand
