[02:08:22] <Bco1981> well almost
[02:08:32] <ButterNoodle> I wouldnt pay for anything pfsense
[02:08:46] <Bco1981> since my internet connection is shared my family pays me a small fee everymonth
[02:08:56] <Bco1981> and that money i use for internet/network stuff
[02:09:04] <ButterNoodle> their support and userbase fail to understand the technology in their product
[02:09:27] <Bco1981> and the meraki firewall can only handle 250mbps... and those damn lincenses every 3 years.

[02:10:46] <ButterNoodle> all my vpn stuff is microservice'd on vm's internally anymore anyway.. cause cisco slow without accelerator cards
[02:10:59] <ButterNoodle> depends on the model

[02:11:46] <MootPoot> I dont understand anything butter is saying but I'll agree with him

[02:12:59] <ButterNoodle> yea the ac2/3 is the best bang for the $$ till u move to something more commercial
[02:13:01] <MootPoot> for terms of doing one specific thing
[02:13:10] <ButterNoodle> Bco1981: but it runs pfsense

[02:13:29] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: asic's have limits
[02:13:29] <Bco1981> yeah... pfsense+
[02:14:06] <ButterNoodle> if I needed more than 600meg I'd just install linux in a pizza box and use that as a router
[02:14:26] <Bco1981> yeah, but that's not a fanless unit i can have in my livingroom...
[02:14:28] <ButterNoodle> I'd probably ditch the dual ISP setup I have.. bc that shit is complicated on linux
[02:14:52] <ButterNoodle> u have 3.8 gig internet?
[02:14:56] <Bco1981> no
[02:14:58] <MootPoot> I dunno shit I just have a modem + Wifi AP combo
[02:15:05] <MootPoot> lul
[02:15:17] <Bco1981> only 300mbps... so far.
[02:15:25] <ButterNoodle> ic
[02:15:41] <Bco1981> but i want a firewall that can handle 1gbit for when i get it.
[02:15:46] <Bco1981> and is fanless
[02:15:49] <ButterNoodle> for a single isp link I've pushed the ac2 to 1gig
[02:15:57] <ButterNoodle> its pretty solid
[02:16:04] <ButterNoodle> and it doesnt run pfsense
[02:16:11] <ButterNoodle> did I mention I hate pfsense?
[02:16:52] <Bco1981> i have only logged in to a vm pfsense a few times, and haven't been able to use the cli on that thing
[02:16:52] <MootPoot> ac2?
[02:17:06] <MootPoot> I 2 have an AC
[02:17:23] <ButterNoodle> I dont like having to give ButterNoodle's networking 101 class to their #pfsense after asking a question.. only to get the response that what I am doing is wrong...
[02:17:43] <MootPoot> I mean isen't that what PFsense is for
[02:17:45] <ButterNoodle> its kinda like going to #archlinux and asking a question

[02:17:58] <MootPoot> rather then actual enterprise
[02:18:02] <ButterNoodle> ig
[02:18:13] <ButterNoodle> I mean pfsense has commercial offerings
[02:18:49] <Bco1981> this one has a web based gui
[02:19:00] <Bco1981> and it has a feature that meraki don't

[02:25:11] <Bco1981> Initial pricing starts at $1198 with the Netgate 5100 and first-year TNSR subscription, and as low as $499 per year thereafter.
[02:25:15] <Bco1981> as low!!! ???
[02:25:27] <ButterNoodle> yuck

[03:17:24] <Bco1981> Denim is probably the most useful, versatile, and popular material of all time. As you don your favorite pair of jeans, say thanks to Latvian Jacob W. Davis, nee Jākobs Jufess in Riga. As a young man, he immigrated to America in 1854 to work as a tailor. In 1870, he was asked to create a strong pair of trousers for woodcutters. He patented the denim material two years later along with Levi Strauss, and

[07:41:02] <amigojapan> MootPoot: making old networks obsolete is yet another way they enforce placed obsolescence
[07:41:33] <MootPoot> Amigo, do you know the definition of obsolete
[07:41:55] <MootPoot> Obsolete doesn't mean that it's broken or its not used anymore 
[07:41:56] <ButterNoodle> what old networks
[07:42:12] <MootPoot> Obsolete means it's no longer the absolute best top tech 
[07:42:16] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: idk.. gopros have a niche
[07:42:18] <MootPoot> Obsolete can be useful 
[07:42:19] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I know we won't be able to use 3g phones any more soon
[07:42:47] <ButterNoodle> you can run ur own 3g phone switch with asterisk and some sdr's
[07:42:56] <amigojapan> No MootPoot obsolete means it cannot be used cause of since factor
[07:43:25] <ButterNoodle> !g definition of obsolete
[07:43:26] <ImoutoBot> ButterNoodle: Definition of obsolete - Merriam-Webster <https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/obsolete> | Obsolete Definition & Meaning | Dictionary.com <https://www.dictionary.com/browse/obsolete> | OBSOLETE | definition in the Cambridge English Dictionary <https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/obsolete>
[07:43:50] <MootPoot> The second definition
[07:43:53] <MootPoot> B
[07:44:35] <MootPoot> 3g was obsolete the second the first 4g tower went up, dosent mean that 3g is no longer in use 
[07:44:51] <MootPoot> The thing is even if we wanted to we couldn't keep using 3g
[07:45:13] <MootPoot> The increased client density and newer bandwidth requirements just can't work on it 
[07:45:17] <amigojapan> Well I am using definition A
[07:45:41] <amigojapan> That is not what I mean MootPoot 
[07:45:42] <MootPoot> But even with definition A, 3g is still useful and is still in use 
[07:45:56] <MootPoot> In a lot of places 
[07:46:03] <MootPoot> It just can't do everything we want it to 
[07:46:06] <amigojapan> MootPoot: soon you can't use 3g in Japan anymore
[07:46:15] <MootPoot> Sure, but that's just japan 
[07:46:21] <MootPoot> Many Asian countries still use 3g
[07:46:28] <MootPoot> 3g still is a thing here

[07:47:35] <amigojapan> MootPoot: many old people only have flip phones that can only do 3g
[07:47:36] <MootPoot> If that was the case they would upgrade cellular tech every 4 years or so 
[07:48:15] <amigojapan> And they will need to buy a new phone
[07:48:30] <MootPoot> Yes but you're not answering the question
[07:48:55] <amigojapan> What's the question?
[07:48:59] <MootPoot> If it was planned for the main reason to make you buy a new phone. Why not change mobile technologies every 2-3 years 
[07:49:15] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: games?
[07:49:18] <MootPoot> Instead of...3g has been around since 2008

[07:50:57] <MootPoot> amigojapan:  so why are you 100% sure now that they are decominissioning 3g to force you to upgrade 
[07:51:28] <ButterNoodle> its call real estate
[07:51:30] <MootPoot> rather then other reasons like "barely anybody uses 3g, it costs too much money to keep it running" , or "we cant get 3g replacement tech anymore" 
[07:51:49] <ButterNoodle> on the ground, on the towers, and in the air itself
[07:52:02] <MootPoot> or "it costs us the same amount to refurb this tower to 3g as it does to just upgrade it to 4g"
[07:52:22] <MootPoot> amigojapan: it seems like you picked an answer and are working backward to find reasoning for it
[07:52:39] <jessedesu3> Only hero 8 has stabilizer?
[07:52:47] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: sure
[07:52:48] <amigojapan> MootPoot: it seems to be several layers to ensure planned obsolescence. Besides the normal hardware breaking easily. There is also forced updates. And lack of support by the network
[07:53:16] <ButterNoodle> jessedesu3: the stabilizer gets better the newer the model
[07:53:33] <ButterNoodle> big improvement from 7-8... not so much 8-9
[07:54:09] <MootPoot> and also like butter said, there is a limited frequency range we can use
[07:54:23] <amigojapan> MootPoot: sooner or later one of them will get your device
[07:54:41] <MootPoot> if we kept 3g running, why would you want such a massive chunk of frequency to be essentially useless
[07:54:46] <MootPoot> since barely anyone has a 3g only phone
[07:55:44] <amigojapan> MootPoot: people like emmeka should agree, since he wanted to buy a phone that lasts forever
[07:56:06] <MootPoot> yeah, but even emmeka realized that things DONT last forever
[07:56:14] <MootPoot> and its a fools errand
[07:56:43] <amigojapan> MootPoot: eventually he gave up cause of network support
[07:57:16] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I think emmeka have up on smart phones tho
[07:57:24] <amigojapan> Gave up
[07:57:44] <MootPoot> idk, emmeka  do you have a smartphoen
[07:58:21] <MootPoot> but anyway, I think the planned oblecence thing is 50% right 
[07:58:32] <amigojapan> Ok
[07:58:34] <MootPoot> its planned, but its planned due to real life constraints
[07:58:43] <MootPoot> not planned so that they can force you to make more money
[07:58:46] <MootPoot> spend*
[07:59:13] <amigojapan> Why wouldn't they try to make more money?
[07:59:19] <MootPoot> phones on average last 3-4 years like I showed you on that graph, keeping that in mind why would a cellular company bother supporting a network beyond that
[07:59:38] <MootPoot> reasonably beyond that, that is
[07:59:57] <MootPoot> amigojapan:  they would try to make more, but by throwing more stuff in for you to buy
[08:00:07] <MootPoot> and you cant do that if you're limited by last gen tech
[08:00:15] <amigojapan> Oh man. Don't you see?! Phones last that short do to planned obsolescence!!!
[08:00:33] <MootPoot> do you have any proof of this
[08:00:44] <amigojapan> 4 years is nothing
[08:00:58] <MootPoot> Think of it this way
[08:01:17] <MootPoot> the first mobile phones, the motorola brick; even that only lasted a few years as well
[08:01:25] <amigojapan> I can't believe you are so blind
[08:01:32] <MootPoot> even through it had nothing but the future to look foreward to

[08:08:44] <MootPoot> if your phone battery and screen only last 4-5 years max

[10:28:53] <isekaijin> Hello, onii-chans (sic), beaky-senpai.
[10:30:48] <beaky> oniichan and senpai from cute girls is my weakness
[10:31:38] <tsukkin> not just cute girls in general ?
[10:32:39] <beaky> cute girls in general indeed, but the 'senpai' is like a super effective hit to my kokroo
[10:32:45] <beaky> kokoro*
[10:33:13] <tsukkin> kokroo
[10:33:14] <beaky> like mei-chan's oniichan in clannad
[10:33:19] <tsukkin> my kokroo going dook doko

[10:37:01] <isekaijin> beaky: A cute girl calling me “senpai” is precisely why I will be whaling for Eyjafjalla when her next banner comes in Arknights.
[10:37:17] <isekaijin> The fact that she is actually powerful is a bonus.
[10:37:47] <beaky> eyjafjalla woah that the iceland volcano 
[10:37:59] <isekaijin> Yes.
[10:38:09] <beaky> ]erupting with cuteness
[10:38:09] <tsukkin> the fate series sure is getting wild 
[10:38:32] <tsukkin> they could just make krakatoa a servant and nobody would bat an eye
[10:39:48] <isekaijin> Something does not sit well with me about genderbendering historical male figures.
[10:39:54] <tsukkin> why
[10:40:31] <isekaijin> It is already unsettling in Kantai Collection when shipgirls have male names, although in that case it is justified, because they are named after a battleship that happens to be named after a male historical figure.
[10:41:08] <tsukkin> in the route of fate / stay night that never got an adaptation there was good reason for saber to be a female king arthur 
[10:41:21] <tsukkin> i have no idea what happened to the series after ataraxia though
[10:44:21] <Urchin[emacs]> I found beardless Gilgamesh to be weirder than gender flipped King Arthur
[10:45:00] <tsukkin> okay but neither of those are anything next to mordred

[10:56:15] <tsukkin> once they earned a lot of money it went in pretty bizarre directions 
[10:57:12] <tsukkin> reading a doujin visual novel made by like 2 guys in highschool is just different from watching a 2 billion dollar anime 
[10:57:21] <Urchin[emacs]> old FSN anime was what got me into really watching anime in the first place

We immediately purchased his identity manifests and repackaged him into the Recon Rover Rick character with a multi-tiered media campaign: televids, touchbooks, holos, psi-tours-- the works.

[11:15:38] <Urchin[emacs]> you have no idea
[11:16:17] <Urchin[emacs]> "The Mind Worms are the natural defenses of the living Planet--the white blood cells, if you will. In a world in which unassimilated thought represents danger, the Mind Worm seeks out concentrations of sentient mental energy and destroys them, ruthlessly and efficiently." --Commissioner Pravin Lal, "Mind Worm, Mind Worm"
[11:17:25] <Urchin[emacs]> "In the years since our arrival, we have foolishly disrupted so many of Planet's ecosystems that entire species may vanish without our ever having understood, or even known them. We must halt this plunder, and halt it immediately, for our own survival as a species depends on our ability to strike a balance on this world." --Commissioner Pravin Lal, "Mind Worm, Mind Worm"
[11:17:54] <DunceCotus> good gravy (miss Maisy)
[11:17:54] <Urchin[emacs]> "Scientific theories are judged by the coherence they lend to our natural experience and the simplicity with which they do so. The grand principle of the heavens balances on the razor's edge of truth." --Commissioner Pravin Lal, "A History of Science"
[11:18:16] <tsukkin> that was the thing from the hitchhiker books right ?
[11:19:13] <Urchin[emacs]> tsukkin: no
[11:19:31] <Urchin[emacs]> tsukkin: these are all quotes from Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri
[11:19:55] <Urchin[emacs]> "If our society seems more nihilistic than that of previous eras, perhaps this is simply a sign of our maturity as a sentient species. As our collective consciousness expands beyond a crucial point, we are at last ready to accept life's fundamental truth: that life's only purpose is life itself." --Chairman Sheng-ji Yang, "Looking God in the Eye"
[11:20:13] <tsukkin> sounds like accelerated neoliberalism to me

[11:21:44] <Urchin[emacs]> "Resources exist to be consumed. And consumed they will be, if not by this generation then by some future. By what right does this forgotten future seek to deny us our birthright? None I say! Let us take what is ours, chew and eat our fill." --CEO Nwabudike Morgan, "The Ethics of Greed"
[11:21:58] <tsukkin> that one i do not like
[11:22:56] <Urchin[emacs]> "And when at last it is time for the transition from megacorporation to planetary government, from entrepreneur to emperor, it is then that the true genius of our strategy shall become apparent, for energy is the lifeblood of this society and when the chips are down he who controls the energy supply controls Planet. In former times the energy monopoly was called "The Power Company"; we intend to give this name an entirely new meaning."
[11:22:56] <Urchin[emacs]> --CEO Nwabudike Morgan, "The Centauri Monopoly"
[11:23:56] <tsukkin> yeah neoliberalism 
[11:24:31] <Urchin[emacs]> "In the great commons at Gaia's Landing we have a tall and particularly beautiful stand of white pine, planted at the time of the first colonies. It represents our promise to the people, and to Planet itself, never to repeat the tragedy of Earth." --Lady Deirdre Skye, "Planet Dreams"

[11:25:56] <Urchin[emacs]> there are many points of view represented
[11:26:04] <tsukkin> so which one do you like
[11:27:05] <Urchin[emacs]> I usually play Yang, and go fairly technocratic, as in lore (crunch was kind of revamped right before the game released, so it's not exactly optimal)
[11:27:22] <Urchin[emacs]> and I usually try to get an alliance with Gaians

[11:29:05] <Urchin[emacs]> more philosophy
[11:29:17] <Urchin[emacs]> let me get his quote on the faction picker screen
[11:29:41] <Urchin[emacs]> "Learn to overcome the crass demands of flesh and bone, for they warp the matrix through which we perceive the world. Extend your awareness outward, beyond the self of body, to embrace the self of group and the self of humanity. The goals of the group and the greater race are transcendent, and to embrace them is to achieve enlightenment." --Chairman Sheng-ji Yang, "Essays on Mind and Matter"

[11:34:19] <tsukkin> i think the immortal soul is a myth
[11:34:39] <tsukkin> at least in any practical human application
[11:35:25] <Urchin[emacs]> "Man's unfailing capacity to believe what he prefers to be true rather than what the evidence shows to be likely and possible has always astounded me. We long for a caring Universe which will save us from our childish mistakes, and in the face of mountains of evidence to the contrary we will pin all our hopes on the slimmest of doubts.

[12:20:14] <jessedesu3> Nah I want 1080
[12:20:20] <jessedesu3> Not ready for 4k
[12:20:22] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: tomako says her school did not teach unicycles. But it was popular anyway
[12:20:23] <ButterNoodle> then a lot less
[12:20:34] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: I thought that was strange
[12:20:54] <Sadale> For example, at 50Mbps that'd be 50/8*60*30 = 11250MB = 11.25GB.
[12:20:56] <jessedesu3> My Canon does 6.6gb for 30 minutes at 1080
[12:21:09] <Sadale> But you could compress or meddle with the config so that the bitrate would get lowered. 
[12:21:39] <jessedesu3> Sadale I don't think you can preset
[12:21:51] <Sadale> It's possible to convert the same info at lower bitrate. But you'd need more computational power for doing that.
[12:21:54] <ButterNoodle> wdym jessedesu3 
[12:21:56] <jessedesu3> Maybe on more expensive equipment
[12:22:06] <jessedesu3> I dunno, does it?
[12:22:17] <Sadale> If you're talking about dumb camera tho, you're probably right that you can't just set the bitrate there
[12:22:17] <ButterNoodle> you can adjust everything
[12:22:43] <jessedesu3> Ntfs has trouble transferring 4gb+ files
[12:22:52] <ButterNoodle> and make presets

[12:32:24] <isekaijin> If you only have 5k in the bank right now, then, well, earning passive income is a good long-term goal, but you must be open to the possibility that you might have to work super hard for a while.

[16:53:13] <lastonestanding> now many days does a year have....
[16:53:31] <amigojapan> darkwitch: no left overs?
[16:53:32] <tsukkin> days and years are human constructs
[16:53:46] <lastonestanding> 365 was correct
[16:54:11] <lastonestanding> isn't it construct created by our sun?
[16:54:16] <darkwitch> some years are 366
[16:54:17] <tsukkin> no
[16:54:24] <amigojapan> tsukkin: a year is more or less a revolution around the sun
[16:54:28] <lastonestanding> sun makes days and nights, and seasons, and years
[16:55:07] <amigojapan> tsukkin: are you a flat earther too?
[16:55:17] <tsukkin> no
[16:55:23] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[16:55:31] <darkwitch> do you pay more for the office license in a leap year?
[16:55:31] <tsukkin> just not a fan of the concept of time 
[16:55:53] <lastonestanding> !c spacetime
[16:55:54] <ImoutoBot> lastonestanding: In physics, spacetime is any mathematical model which fuses the three dimensions of space and the one dimension of time into a single four-dimensional manifold. Spacetime diagrams can be used to visualize relativistic effects, such as why different observers perceive differently where and when events occur.
[16:56:04] <tsukkin> spacetime is a different thing 
[16:56:24] <lastonestanding> so, you don't like clocks?
[16:56:27] <tsukkin> nope 
[16:56:37] <lastonestanding> it's just numbers to me
[16:57:02] <tsukkin> it seems most people live their lives ruled by it 
[16:57:04] <lastonestanding> I see 13:37 and think "leet"
[16:57:18] <amigojapan> tsukkin: not a fan? It is caused by the movements of the sun. If you believe that you can't not believe in time
[16:57:37] <DunceCotus> time cannot be measured
[16:57:41] <tsukkin> measuring it and quantifying it that way is more what i have an issue with
[16:58:03] <DunceCotus> the measurement of time is more about controlling the population
[16:58:09] <DunceCotus> it benefits those in power
[16:58:09] <tsukkin> ^
[16:58:20] <lastonestanding> then how are two people supposed to meet at a certain time?
[16:58:31] <DunceCotus> lastonestanding: they're not
[16:58:43] <lastonestanding> stay at home instead?
[16:58:45] <lastonestanding> wow
[16:59:01] <DunceCotus> they are already together
[16:59:06] <amigojapan> tsukkin: I don't think you are against measuring time. I think you are against being bound by a schedule
[16:59:09] <tsukkin> you would use the local time of where they are meeting 
[16:59:11] <lastonestanding> romantic
[16:59:30] <tsukkin> amigojapan i fundamentally dislike the concept of ' global times ' 
[16:59:59] <tsukkin> hold on

[17:00:26] <DunceCotus> I think space may also be a control mechanism
[17:01:19] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: you and tsukkin are not agreeing, you are coming from very different ideas
[17:01:28] <DunceCotus> you need to participate in market system to travevl
[17:01:48] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I think we are on similar wavelengths here
[17:02:16] <amigojapan> No DunceCotus tsukkin said he is but a flat earther
[17:02:37] <DunceCotus> not many people are
[17:02:39] <DunceCotus> that's okay
[17:02:45] <tsukkin> the opposite duncecotus , making people think they need to travel is more the issue
[17:02:49] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: he said he is just against measuring time
[17:02:57] <tsukkin> i am female for the record 
[17:03:17] <DunceCotus> tsukkin: well sure
[17:03:20] <amigojapan> Ok sorry tsukkin 
[17:03:40] <tsukkin> no problem ^~^
[17:03:53] <tsukkin> i was just getting confused as to who you were talking about 
[17:04:45] <tsukkin> i am not a flat earther either 
[17:04:59] * darkwitch is a round earther
[17:05:22] <DunceCotus> round Earth is a disease
[17:05:26] <tsukkin> though i believe the fact that the earth is not perfectly round is part of why years and days are fake 
[17:05:29] <DunceCotus> teaches people to give up
[17:05:44] <tsukkin> ummn . . how ?
[17:05:58] <DunceCotus> a globe in a endless void = no escape
[17:06:05] <DunceCotus> as opposed to my model, bubblebath universe
[17:06:13] <DunceCotus> where the Earth is merely one bubble among many
[17:06:35] <tsukkin> that just sounds like round earth
[17:06:49] <tsukkin> or maybe many worlds depending on how you mean it
[17:06:52] <DunceCotus> tsukkin: there is a celestial sphere, but the ground is flat
[17:07:04] <tsukkin> well that seems pretty easy to test for yourself 
[17:07:07] <DunceCotus> its more like a bubble than a globe
[17:07:17] <DunceCotus> tsukkin: easier done than said
[17:07:41] <tsukkin> i feel like i read about someone doing it like 6000 years ago
[17:08:16] <tsukkin> what about every other celestial body that we can see is round ?
[17:08:24] <DunceCotus> we don't even know what happened 150 years ago
[17:08:27] <DunceCotus> let alone 6000
[17:08:34] <lastonestanding> our earth does not have a magnetic core?
[17:09:14] <DunceCotus> tsukkin: they are round, but they're also much smaller than science believes
[17:09:23] <DunceCotus> and much closer to us
[17:09:28] <tsukkin> duncecotus does your model have an explanation for astrology 
[17:09:46] <lastonestanding> you need empiric data
[17:10:00] <amigojapan> Holland tulip fields are fantastic
[17:10:01] <DunceCotus> tsukkin: personally I think the stars and galaxies are like detritus and plasmic bubbles suspended in the boundary layers of the Earth's cell wall
[17:10:07] <darkwitch> data from the empire
[17:10:34] <tsukkin> ummn
[17:10:41] <tsukkin> do you know how lenses work ?
[17:10:41] <lastonestanding> I thought that galaxies are surrounded by dark matter
[17:10:43] <DunceCotus> tsukkin: so each bubble has its own local celestial sphere
[17:10:48] <DunceCotus> which means local suns, moons, stars etc.

[17:13:17] <tsukkin> what is a main god 
[17:13:22] <DunceCotus> if measurement of time produces it
[17:13:27] <lastonestanding> like, Zeus
[17:13:27] <DunceCotus> then measurement of space produces space 
[17:13:35] <lastonestanding> the big one
[17:13:36] <tsukkin> zeus was never stated to have created the world 
[17:14:01] <lastonestanding> the world was already there?

[17:14:11] <tsukkin> by the time zeus showed up yes 
[17:14:20] <DunceCotus> bubblebath universe Earth is still small
[17:14:21] <lastonestanding> you sure?

[17:14:30] <DunceCotus> there are many variations of Earth surrounding us

[17:16:04] <Roey> <tsukkin> hi roey we were just talking about how we hate the measurement of time  <- oh! ok then
[17:16:40] <tsukkin> <DunceCotus> then measurement of space produces space <- feet and meters are not real either this is correct
[17:17:38] <Roey> yeah, what are hours anyway but a symbol of aligning one's self to bigoted sexist homophobic neo-con arch-capitalist nazi Hitler-magnates?
[17:17:50] <tsukkin> except that the reality that not all things exist in the same space or same time is still true 
[17:18:19] <DunceCotus> tsukkin: true
[17:18:19] <tsukkin> roey time as we use it in modern life is a capitalistic construct 
[17:18:29] <Roey> of course
[17:18:32] <Roey> evil evil capitalists
[17:18:48] <darkwitch> time lords
[17:19:19] <tsukkin> not sure i said evil anywhere 
[17:19:50] * Roey repeats the Leftist totem pole: bigoted -> misogynist -> racist -> homophobic -> neo-con arch-capitalist -> fascist -> Nazi -> Hitler -> No, like *literally* Hitler
[17:19:50] <tsukkin> the structure of capitalism is unsustainable so i like to think about the parts i would like to change as a mental exercise 
[17:20:10] <Roey> I'm calling bullshit on all that, see
[17:20:18] <Roey> tsukkin: you wouldn't be on your computer without capitalism
[17:20:22] <tsukkin> that is true 
[17:20:24] <Roey> I think it's sustained itself quite nicely
[17:20:36] <tsukkin> which is why i would like to fix  the broken parts before the entire thing crumbles and leaves me without a lifeline 
[17:20:48] <Roey> tsukkin: it's sustained itself long enough for us to see many transormations over life 200 years ago
[17:20:51] <tsukkin> just because something has sustained itself for a while does not mean it is permanently sustainable 
[17:20:58] <tsukkin> that is an absurd thing to say 
[17:21:04] <Roey> it takes people to run it
[17:21:06] <Roey> it's just words on paper
[17:21:07] <tsukkin> your body has sustained itself all this time 
[17:21:17] <tsukkin> do you think it will continue to do so indefinitely ?

[17:22:33] <Roey> *nice
[17:22:37] <tsukkin> yeah 
[17:23:45] <tsukkin> the idea that a system should never change is functionally the same as a cell in your body developing cancer

[19:12:02] <amigojapan> Alright tsukkin 
[19:12:40] <tsukkin> i enjoy edgy anime more when the main character is not given a free pass out of moral responsibility is all

[23:50:51] <Jigsy> Yeah, I pressed the wrong button.
[23:51:00] <Jigsy> I was trying to unmute my audio.
[23:51:45] <Bco1981> lol
[23:52:10] <Bco1981> a power button should be close to other buttons...
[23:52:13] <Jigsy> I don't know which idiot decided that putting shutdown next to unmute on the keyboard was a great idea.
[23:52:17] <Bco1981> shouldn't*
