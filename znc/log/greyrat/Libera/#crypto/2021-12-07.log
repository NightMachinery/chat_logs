[00:14:41] <MacGyver> On a scale of 10 to GnuPG, how would you rate the user experience?
[00:14:50] <sarnold> heh
[00:15:11] <joe7057> but is it as mature and secure? Because honestly with messages of any length 12 extra lines isn't really that bad. Especially once you get into automated systems that handle it for you
[00:15:14] <joe7057> lol
[00:15:28] <MacGyver> joe7057: Oh PGP is *mature*, definitely.
[00:15:33] <MacGyver> One could call it positively geriatric.
[00:15:36] * Alipha debates wasting the afternoon writing a cmd line utility to sign irc messages
[00:15:52] <joe7057> actually was super easy, because after a lot of cursing and wishing to throw my computer out the window, I installed the GpgFrontend application. Sooooo much easier.
[00:16:23] <joe7057> lol. I know PGP, I meant the ecdsa algorithm specifically as compared to SHA512
[00:16:47] <joe7057> (I know PGP is very mature, which is what I meant to say, but forgot half the sentence, lol)
[00:17:34] <Alipha> sha512 is a hash algorithm, not a signature algorithm. that PGP signature is a DSA signature (not sure what hash it uses underneath. i'd _assume_ sha256, actually)
[00:18:06] <Alipha> presumably you could use sha256 or sha512 with ECDSA
[00:18:26] <joe7057> ohhh I see what you mean. 
[00:18:31] <joe7057> I'll look into it.

[11:17:56] <maroon> the 2nd layer of symmetric shouldn't be noticeably slow, and should onl be done after making sure the rest of the system is secure. the 2nd lock should only be added once you make sure the door's hinges aren't easily removed, that it isnt right next to an easily opened window, etc

[15:44:37] <frost> hi
[15:49:45] <MacGyver> Hash: Two layers of symmetric encryption with good algorithms (i.e. well scrutinized, large enough block size, large enough key space) doesn't really buy us anything because we're not actually that worried about symmetric algorithms that make it to standard being broken in practice.
[15:49:56] <MacGyver> Hash: So it's computational effort for negligible gain.
[15:50:28] <MacGyver> Hash: That being said, if you *do* do this to fix an issue with a bad algorithm, you're at risk of getting dual-DES -- i.e. susceptible to a meet-in-the-middle attack.
[15:50:38] <MacGyver> Hash: So that's something to watch out for.

[18:09:26] <TimMc> yawkat: Even if most attacks aren't against the algorithm, wouldn't you say that a great many are against the implementation?
[18:09:56] <TimMc> So perhaps two layers of encryption, each implemented by someone else -- as long as you're not worried about timing attacks. :-P
[18:10:04] <yawkat> i would also say those arent usually fixed by two layers :P
[18:11:07] <TimMc> "those" meaning?
