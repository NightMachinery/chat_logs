[01:50:30] <bl1nk> It's been made pretty clear by a lot of people that not getting the vaccine will make you eventually get covid. There's no waiting for herd immunity afaik.
[01:51:09] <bl1nk> I only have german sources though
[01:51:54] <Activ8> maybe if you stop in the house all the time and never go out

[23:34:52] <JohnComputation> well, I am back here and starting fresh after the whole ordeal with the... other network
[23:35:18] <JohnComputation> for those who may remember... my former nick was "RisingTechGuru"
[23:35:28] <JohnComputation> changed that username because I didn't like it anymore.
[23:35:59] <JohnComputation> My bouncer got disconnected one day and never bothered to figure it all out until last night.
[23:36:35] <JohnComputation> Starting over completely fresh. New account and username, new CERT for SASL and all... I'm connected once again
