[06:13:52] <Delf> You don't agree with moral relativism?
[06:14:12] *** Quits: Null_A (~null_a@2601:645:8700:2290:3c1e:11a0:debc:333e) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[06:20:08] <causative_> well, a moral relativist needs to admit they agree with the perspective of the guy in the comic, or else find some reason why the guy in the comic isn't right
[06:21:06] <Delf> Not needing a reason does not mean not having one already :P
[06:23:02] <Delf> There are pitfalls of outsourcing your ability to judge to others. You become a pawn, a tool for others to yield and most likely abuse others through you
[06:24:57] <Delf> Just because it is an established religion, has lots of people, majority vote... popular, does not mean it is "valid" as an authority
[06:25:20] <causative_> certainly, you are correct to say that
[06:25:37] <Delf> I consider myself to be the prime authority
[06:26:48] <causative_> argument from authority isn't valid even if it's yourself
[06:26:51] <Delf> This also has major pitfalls, one has bad values
[06:26:53] <causative_> not in moral matters
[06:27:57] <Delf> I usually say I have no morals but someone here a few months ago had a discussion with me and managed to explain it to me that I do have morals
[06:28:12] <Delf> I have values and that is enough for me
[06:29:35] <causative_> what if they're wrong?
[06:29:59] <Delf> They usually are, in respect to others
[06:30:14] <causative_> what if they're wrong in respect to yourself?
[06:30:35] <Delf> I harbour such values also
[06:32:58] <Delf> Would that be a problem?

[06:34:52] <Delf> Keep it simple. Be both malevolent and benevolent. Select a preference.
[06:36:31] <causative_> well, then you live by the preference you selected and then you decide you don't like the result
[06:36:42] <causative_> so you were wrong
[06:36:48] <causative_> so it's possible to have wrong preferences
[06:39:56] <Delf> I'm always wrong and right. I'm the one making that decision
[06:41:08] <Delf> I'm right now, tomorrow I'm wrong, vince versa
[06:42:15] <Delf> Am I missing anything?

[12:18:11] <trbp> being human has nothing to do about wealth beeing well fed not ill or painless
[12:18:29] <trbp> it is more about the mindset, you still can be human even if all the others fail
[12:19:04] <trbp> heck most that do not have ever seen one of the other factors you counted up, tend to be less human though ;)

[12:20:26] <Jong> Hello friends and fellow lovers of wisdom
[12:22:04] <trbp> hi jong
[12:22:59] <Jong> Hello those who choose truth over comfort, even if when it means accepting that one's life is limited and that no afterlife exists, an uncomfortable truth that many lie to themselves about in a misguided hope to bring themselves comfort
[12:23:24] <Jong> hi trbp
[12:23:56] <Jong> wow, my last statement was pretty elegant, or is it just me who thinks that?
[12:25:29] <trbp> well it gives at least some kind of view into some of your mindsets axioms ;)
[12:25:39] <trbp> but it is pretty neat ;)

[12:28:38] <brigand> so you don't greet religious people?
[12:30:03] <Jong> brigand or they choose not to be greeted
[12:31:35] <Jong> brigand  it's like a rap diss song that doesn't name names. If you think the song is about you, it probably is about you
[12:32:31] <Jong> If you think the song is talking about you, that's your admission to yourself that the song's claims are accurate
[12:32:34] <trbp> well i would not go as far as to put it into line with some verse of the old one but it reminds some
[12:34:43] <trbp> jong, true it is always a question about communication, sending and perception
[12:35:22] <trbp> though sometimes the message leads the interpretation and then again the intention fails the understanding...
[12:35:56] <trbp> with all those misunderstandings life has, it is a wonder that things work out ;)
[12:36:19] <trbp> and sometimes just a litte burp makes the greatest wars
[12:37:44] <brigand> so if i say you're ugly and you feel ugly it is truth?
[12:37:45] <trbp> question is, how open/tolerant can someone be to other mindsets and concepts?
[12:37:59] <Jong> Wars are distracting as is news. Time for me to focus on my life, the immediate present moment, and the software I'm coding
[12:38:26] <Jong> brigand  I suppose when there's a bit of truth, the statement hurts more than if it were totally false.
[12:38:59] <trbp> brigand: at least for yourself at that very moment it is... and depending on how your influence (be it direct or indirect) to your surroundings is, it could also be echoed by the others
[12:39:56] <trbp> that goes even so far that you may just uncounciously feel like that and that shines outside....
[12:41:47] <Jong> brigand  you remind me of socrates, walking around town asking questions that probe into murky area of uncertainty in how to answer
[12:43:15] <Jong> seriously, I want to be productive now. Ttl ya'll later. Software development calls me
[12:43:23] <brigand> good luck
[12:44:40] <brigand> irl it makes people uncomfortable
[12:45:41] <brigand> but maybe over the internet people tend to say thinks that were unspeakable of before
[12:46:19] <brigand> is this anti-wittgenstein?
[12:47:23] <brigand> oh, it is not
[12:47:48] <brigand> this was my admission on how little i know about philosophy

[13:14:42] <amigojapan> oh hey evolv!!!
[13:15:16] <evolv> In Buddhism, while there are other realms to be reborn to that are better than others, they're all inadequate and impermanent. Rebirth is unsatisfactory, and it can go on indefinitely unless addressed by following the eightfold path

[13:20:33] <evolv> amigojapan, does that predate Buddhism?
[13:20:39] <evolv> in Japan, that is
[13:20:50] <evolv> in the suttas, a deva asked Buddha how he crossed the flood

[13:21:20] <amigojapan> evolv: I am nto sure,m I think hong kong has it too
[13:21:43] <amigojapan> evolv: after you cross the river, you drink a cup of tea that erases yyour memories before rebirth
[13:21:47] <evolv> Buddhism in China is very old
[13:22:36] <evolv> that sounds like Buddhist influence
[13:22:49] <evolv> Chan Buddhism in China became Zen Buddhism in Japan
[13:23:11] <evolv> and became Seon Buddhism in Korea, Thien Buddhism in Vietnam, etc.
