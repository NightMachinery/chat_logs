[14:49:30] <labrador> dakship, well ur correct except I could argue if such a live env is made just to install a distro and cannot actually do much by itself(or atleast isn't intended to),is it really a good idea to consider it

[15:04:39] <Zbnssn[m]> you cant see images, no browser just a blinking cursor on a black screen on which u can type

[15:04:50] <Hello[m]> > tui - terminal user interface
[15:04:50] <Hello[m]> For simpler process of installation calamares is added in that but it is barebones and has live environment
[15:05:28] <Zbnssn[m]> Then you install a display server
[15:05:28] <Zbnssn[m]> Usually Xorg and Wayland (which is supposed to be newer to Wayland yet most people prefer Xorg/X11)
[15:05:29] <Hello[m]> Hello[m]: That's why it's called gui
[15:05:56] <Zbnssn[m]> Then kn top of it you install a DeskEnv or a WindowManager
[15:06:33] <Zbnssn[m]> some ppl just want it all done out of box post install so they usually download it from the site in that format
[15:07:16] <Zbnssn[m]> Hello[m]: Yeah like in manjaro right?
[15:07:59] <Hello[m]> Zbnssn[m]: Yep but really really barebones.
[15:08:27] <Zbnssn[m]> labrador: i mean most server room interaction are done on a tty... I wont call them underpowered
[15:09:06] <labrador> Zbnssn[m], like ttys can't scroll and also don't have truecolour
[15:09:14] <Zbnssn[m]> Hello[m]: ok so correct me if I'm wrong...

[15:13:42] <Aaron[m]1> It had very good sponsorblock and returnyoutubedisklike integration
[15:14:02] <Aaron[m]1> Due to moral shit newpipe didnt even integrate sponsorblock into newpipe
[15:14:05] <Zbnssn[m]> https://archlinuxgui.in/download.html#i3
[15:14:07] <NatuKaka> Title: ALG - Download (at archlinuxgui.in)
[15:14:16] <Zbnssn[m]> Yeah here u can see i3, bspwm and so on
[15:14:35] <Zbnssn[m]> Download and im p sure there you'd be able to interact on the live iso
[15:14:47] <telegram_1346084> Aaron[m]1: Theres fork with sponserblock
[15:15:44] <Aaron[m]1> telegram_1346084: Yeah but its not on main app they couldve disabled it by default
[15:15:46] <Hello[m]> Zbnssn[m]: Like Aaron said live wm and barebones.
[15:15:50] <labrador> Newpipe is fundamentally different compared to vanced
[15:15:55] <telegram_1346084> I can feel swarm of people now downloading newpipe
[15:16:11] <labrador> Its not to give a premium experience or something like that. Its a free software youtube viewer
[15:16:13] <Zbnssn[m]> Aaron[m]1: They want the experience to vanilla as possible yt with no ads that's it... i didnt know it was a moral issue
[15:17:38] <Zbnssn[m]> telegram_1346084: Never installed vanced had newpipe from start... and it's p good from how it was before
[15:18:08] <Zbnssn[m]> vanced had the option for google sign in... I thought my acc would be banned so never did
[15:20:05] <labrador> Zbnssn[m], its just a modded youtube app so it can do that...but newpipe could hack some stuff to redirect you to a browser to pass the google sign in then import a cookie
[15:21:17] <telegram_1346084> Yea, we prefer Loss always (Libre and Open source)
[15:21:25] <labrador> hahahhaha
[15:21:53] <telegram_1346084> But vanced has huge user base
[15:22:03] <labrador> telegram_1346084, we don't really gaf about that userbase
[15:22:19] <labrador> Its just people looking to suck creators dy
[15:22:22] <labrador> dry*
[15:22:28] <telegram_1346084> Subreddit alone has 94k+ subs, so not a surprise.
[15:22:28] <telegram_1346084> Even linustech mentioned it somewhere
[15:22:31] <labrador> Not that youtube isn't trying to do the same...but still
[15:23:20] <telegram_1346084> Agreed

[15:25:38] <Aaron[m]1> Booted archcraft os but dont know which wm i am using
[15:25:47] <Aaron[m]1> Also how to change brightness
[15:26:45] <telegram_1346084> Just check btop or htop
[15:26:58] <telegram_1346084> Get brightnessctl for brightness
[15:29:08] <telegram_1346084> You wanted vanill arch? or gui arch installer?
[15:30:29] <Aaron[m]1> telegram_1346084: I dont want to install
[15:30:33] <Aaron[m]1> I am fine with debian
[15:32:02] <AryaK[m]> openbox
[15:41:13] <Zbnssn[m]> <labrador> "..., we don't really gaf about..." <- i mean if it becomes too popular it is bad
[15:43:29] <Zbnssn[m]> <Aaron[m]1> "Booted archcraft os but dont..." <- it says there on neofetch... xfce and you shell ur using  is fish
[15:43:30] <labrador> Zbnssn[m], well it wasn't free software ever so not me
[15:43:38] <labrador> ew why fish
[15:44:57] <mxbl> use zsh
[15:45:03] <mxbl> but without oh-my-zsh
[15:45:10] <Zbnssn[m]> yeah much rather support newpipe because it's it's own thing with GPL v3
[15:45:10] <mxbl> bc then you can go back to fish
[15:45:29] <Zbnssn[m]> or if you're totally new just get urself familiarized with bash
[15:46:18] <mxbl> true
[15:46:26] <Zbnssn[m]> fish is not posix-compliant... so if ur using scripts made by other people written in bash/dash/zsh or other posix-compliant shell it won't run
[15:46:27] <mxbl> vanced is
[15:46:30] <mxbl> https://envs.sh/EcT.jpg
[15:46:45] <Zbnssn[m]> Yes XDD
[15:47:14] <Zbnssn[m]> still feeling bad for the devs who worked into it
[15:47:57] <mxbl> fish shell can run bash and other posix compliant shell scripts
[15:47:58] <Zbnssn[m]> they had plenty sponsors too now that I see
[15:48:05] <mxbl> bcs of shebang line

[15:49:01] <Tor[m]> Startpage is okish 
[15:49:07] <mxbl> whoogle
[15:49:34] <Zbnssn[m]> oh yeah you just have to change it from #!/bin/sh to something /usr/bin/env
[15:49:36] <telegram_1346084> searx better
[15:49:41] <mxbl> no you dont
[15:49:48] <mxbl> unless you symlink /bin/sh to fish
[15:49:53] <mxbl> that's stupid
[15:50:24] <Zbnssn[m]> DT made a sorta cringe video about it using terms like virgin/chad lol https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4KJF-6Agc
[15:50:30] <mxbl> yeah i remember
[15:50:42] <mxbl> and then luke made a reaction vid.
[15:50:51] <Zbnssn[m]> to which luke smith reacted to which brodie reacted
[15:50:55] <Zbnssn[m]> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAkfAx8XCgA
[15:50:59] <mxbl> yeah
[15:51:04] <labrador> Why do we even watch such youtubers lmao
[15:51:07] <labrador> They're all cringe
[15:51:13] <mxbl> brodie isn't cringe
[15:51:30] <labrador> mxbl, well what channel is brodie on?
[15:51:37] <mxbl> brodie robertson
[15:51:39] <Zbnssn[m]> yeah brodie is actually pretty knowledgeable for spreading good programs
[15:51:55] <mxbl> dt and luke have great linux content too
[15:52:19] <Zbnssn[m]> old videos usually
[15:52:20] <labrador> not really mxbl its useless content
[15:52:22] <telegram_1346084> I agree too. He is the only one who does current things for linux
[15:52:28] <labrador> Worthless videos with no learning value
[15:52:32] <mxbl> what
[15:52:39] <mxbl> you're literally in #gnulinuxindia
[15:52:57] <labrador> mxbl, yeah? And are these guys indian or something?
[15:53:03] <labrador> I dunno what point you're tryna make
[15:53:09] <mxbl> linux users
[15:53:12] <telegram_1346084> learnlinuxtv is also good
[15:53:19] <mxbl> > linux content has no learning value
[15:53:24] <labrador> mxbl, not all linux users are worth listening to
[15:53:27] <Zbnssn[m]> yep linode is good vps provider
[15:53:34] <mxbl> by linux content i mean stuff like showing how pipes work
[15:53:38] <labrador> Zbnssn[m], najala is what I would recommend
[15:53:42] <mxbl> not videos about opinions
[15:53:43] <labrador> mxbl, thats basic stuff
[15:53:51] <labrador> Go read the tlcl if you really wanna learn
[15:53:59] <mxbl> it was just an example
[15:54:01] <labrador> s/the tlcl/tlcl
[15:54:11] <Zbnssn[m]> labrador: are you like saying these because of luke smith's videos on pajeet and stuff?
[15:54:27] <labrador> mxbl, no you make a good point. Most of their videos are on extrememly basic topics
[15:54:39] <telegram_1346084> Whoever uses laptop here, do you use optimus power and autocpu-freq?
[15:54:46] <mxbl> telegram_1346084: no
[15:54:57] <labrador> Zbnssn[m], well he is a righty...
[15:54:58] <Zbnssn[m]> telegram_1346084: i use autocpu-freq
[15:55:04] <Zbnssn[m]> optimus I don't recommend
[15:55:10] <mxbl> labrador: true, doesn't mean they are bad though
[15:55:16] <gtlsgamr> labrador: Luke is a guy who is all /g/ memes at once
[15:55:20] <mxbl> true
[15:55:24] <telegram_1346084> So tlp and autocpu-freq are enough for laptop?
[15:55:27] <gtlsgamr> impersonator, living a fake persona
[15:55:29] <Zbnssn[m]> yeah even people at /g/ hate him
[15:55:38] <labrador> gtlsgamr, and do you think /g/ is the creme of the crop of the internet or something?
[15:55:39] <labrador> lol
[15:55:44] <mxbl> lol
[15:55:47] <gtlsgamr> What fuck no
[15:56:01] <gtlsgamr> that was the point i was tryna make! He took all of that shit seriously
[15:56:06] <labrador> oh
[15:56:12] <Zbnssn[m]> they doxxed his location and found the house he lives in belongs to some dead relative

[15:56:29] <Aaron[m]1> On my fourth distro today this is amazing
[15:56:29] <mxbl> s/browser/browse/
[15:56:33] <Zbnssn[m]> labrador: so many newbs in /g/
[15:56:42] <labrador> mxbl, well I used to and believe me it has nothing of value...
[15:57:02] <mxbl> so does most of the internet
[15:57:03] <Zbnssn[m]> Aaron[m]1: never understood distrohopping but hope u learn something from it ig
[15:57:32] <labrador> Zbnssn[m], distro hopping isn't really a good idea unless you're increasing the difficulty or something
[15:57:38] <Zbnssn[m]> labrador what resources do u recommend for learning?
[15:57:41] <labrador> Like trying arch from debian,or gentoo from arch
[15:58:01] <Aaron[m]1> Yeah I learned how simple things are assumed but theres a lot behind them
[15:58:02] <labrador> Zbnssn[m], I dunno wikipedia,tlcl,and a search engine should be enough
[15:58:29] <Zbnssn[m]> I dont want to install gentoo I don't think it's worth it... I compile alot of rust programs from scratch and I don't think my laptop can sustain compiling entire kernels
[15:58:56] <labrador> Zbnssn[m], kernels are simple af to compile...takes 15 minutes to compile on a semi-modern cpu
[15:59:00] <labrador> The real shit is browsers
[15:59:00] <Zbnssn[m]> brodie did a stream and it was pretty cool it was just like arch and gentoo wiki is v detailed
[15:59:06] <mxbl> compiling rust programs compile longer than rust stuff
[15:59:11] <Zbnssn[m]> oh yeah
[15:59:15] <mxbl> s/compile/takes/
[15:59:31] <Zbnssn[m]> I remember firstly installing arch and doing
[15:59:31] <Zbnssn[m]> sudo pacman -S brave
[15:59:36] <gtlsgamr> 17:56        mxbl â”‚  do you browser /g/ )) <-- used to. long ago
[15:59:40] <mxbl> s/rust programs/kernel/
[15:59:51] <labrador> My god rust is an absolute mess of a language but thats just my opinion
[15:59:53] <Zbnssn[m]> wrst mistake I thought my computer got corrupted or smth
[16:00:13] <mxbl> ?
[16:00:19] <mxbl> what happened Zbnssn[m] 
[16:00:19] <gtlsgamr> I started learning rust, left halfway because the borrowing mechanism felt too restricting
[16:00:35] <Zbnssn[m]> I'm pretty good into it felt very intuitive to me
[16:00:59] <Aaron[m]1> labrador: It takes long time to compile but coding experience is great as i hear
[16:01:40] <Zbnssn[m]> mxbl: I didn;t know binaries existed... I basically was downloading the source code of brave and then compiling the entire browser
[16:01:51] <mxbl> pacman -S can only install binaries
[16:01:55] <Zbnssn[m]> I reinstalled arch for fresh experience
[16:02:06] <Zbnssn[m]> installed yay
[16:02:12] <Zbnssn[m]> did yay brave
[16:02:16] <Zbnssn[m]> and on first result was brave-bin
[16:02:20] <labrador> yeah mxbl what he
[16:02:27] <labrador> yeah mxbl what he's saying doesn't compute for me
[16:02:44] <mxbl> yay -S makes more sense then
[16:02:51] <labrador> yeah
[16:03:41] <mxbl> when i was inexperienced with the aur (and linux distros in general), i didn't know what -bin was too, made the same mistake
[16:04:17] <labrador> mxbl, how long have you been using linux?
[16:04:24] <mxbl> almost two years
[16:04:53] <labrador> yeah you seemed a little more experienced
[16:06:08] <mxbl> how long have you been using it?
[16:06:25] <labrador> mxbl, about a year
[16:06:50] <mxbl> k
[16:06:56] <mxbl> what distro did you start on
[16:07:28] <labrador> mxbl, I've been on debian the whole time. I know its embarassing compared to people using arch or even gentoo doe.
[16:07:39] <mxbl> debian is a great distro
[16:09:04] <labrador> well yeah but its basically using training wheels compared to the more hands off distros
[16:09:34] <mxbl> depends on how you install it
[16:09:41] <mxbl> you can install it the "arch-way" too
[16:09:53] <Zbnssn[m]> <mxbl> "pacman -S can only install..." <- Not really like if u search on aur for ungoogled chromium... there's no binary for it so u have to compile it from source
[16:09:54] <mxbl> but yeah most people probably use the installer 
[16:10:14] <labrador> I was admittedly a little stupid when I partitioned my drive...basically debian stretches my entire hdd so to install any other I need to risk shrinking the partition
[16:10:21] <mxbl> Zbnssn[m]: yeah but if you use pacman -S it gets a binary from the repos
[16:10:33] <Zbnssn[m]> I see
[16:10:42] <labrador> Zbnssn[m], yeah pacman doesn't work with the aur
[16:10:47] <Zbnssn[m]> That's good precaution
[16:11:09] <Zbnssn[m]> i prolly did yay - S makes sense what u said
[16:11:50] <mxbl> the official way to get stuff from the aur is to git clone the thing you wanna install, run makepkg and then pacman -U the binary you compiled 
[16:13:12] <labrador> well mxbl practically noone does it that way
[16:13:59] <mxbl> yeah
[16:18:24] <mxbl> btw
[16:18:32] <mxbl> TUI stands for text-BASED user interface
[16:18:44] <labrador> good catch
[16:35:48] <JB[m]> <Tor[m]> "> <@telegram_1058687251:t2bot.io..." <- Custom startpage u mean or is it a search engine

[16:42:27] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> <Zbnssn[m]> "I dont want to install gentoo..." <- u can use binaries for kernel and browsers
[16:44:54] <mxbl> don't use a binary for kernel
[16:45:17] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> distro kernel
[16:45:19] <mxbl> well, if you install it for the first time, then whatever
[16:45:22] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i use one they are good
[16:45:50] <mxbl> yeah but there goes gentoo's customization aspect 
[16:46:05] <PeroSar[m]> <Aaron[m]1> "It takes long time to compile..." <- "long time to compile" depends on the dependencies you use
[16:46:40] <mxbl> because the reason to use gentoo is probably customization/tuning for performance
[16:48:24] <Aaron[m]1> PeroSar[m]: Yeah after first time it is quick

[17:03:14] <relejek[m]> <labrador> "mxbl, I've been on debian the..." <- ^ for this
[17:06:16] <mxbl> by self built debian do you mean installed the arch way or completely build from source (the gentoo way)
[17:06:29] <relejek[m]> <Aaron[m]1> "I know but in first time..." <- hang in there, my guy. a bit of confusion and overwhelm is part of learning and growth. i say that to you and to my self coz  i find myself in the similar state many time.

[17:12:56] <klimi[m]> i will upgrade to the new LTS when it comes and semester is not in full
[17:13:00] <mxbl> klimi[m]: you don't seem to have a choice then^^
[17:13:06] <relejek[m]> 20.10 had many feature updates that made 20.04 feel outdated.
[17:13:15] <klimi[m]> well yeah sure
[17:13:26] <klimi[m]> but i need something that will work for 1 year without much tinkering
[17:13:31] <klimi[m]> tinkering = work
[17:13:35] <klimi[m]> * = work = time
[17:13:55] <klimi[m]> mxbl: well... the thing is... can docker.io run without root?
[17:14:05] <klimi[m]> i don't want users to run their shit under root
[17:14:42] <mxbl> users?
[17:14:53] <mxbl> are you gonna host it
[17:14:57] <relejek[m]> klimi[m]: yeah it is best to keep production(public use) machines on super stable version.
[17:15:41] <klimi[m]> mxbl: yep
[17:15:50] <mxbl> anyways the daemon probably runs as root but afaik the user can use it without root perms
[17:15:59] <mxbl> i'm not really experienced with docker though
[17:15:59] <klimi[m]> yeah
[17:16:02] <klimi[m]> but i don't want it to run under root
[17:16:28] <klimi[m]> mxbl: likewise... that's why i don't want to mess things up with docker running under root

[17:52:23] <Tor[m]> mxbl: WhatsApp too ? 
[17:54:26] <mxbl> i don't really use whatsapp that often
[17:55:08] <mxbl> i only check once every evening to bcs of school stuff
[17:55:20] <mxbl> it's the only chat app that people in my class use.
[17:55:23] <Tor[m]> mxbl: Same 
[17:55:38] <Tor[m]> mxbl: Stories are same everywhere
[17:55:56] <Tor[m]> Forcing people to download signal tho
[17:56:30] <gtlsgamr> Tor[m]: If it is a single tree you can try a scarecrow
[17:56:33] <gtlsgamr> they actualyl work
[17:56:33] <mxbl> signal is okay-ish
[17:56:47] <mxbl> atleast it works on desktop
[17:56:49] <gtlsgamr> mxbl: is weechat intuitive? I am afraid to leave irssi
[17:57:00] <mxbl> it was easier than irssi for me
[17:57:06] <mxbl> might wanna read this:
[17:57:08] <Tor[m]> gtlsgamr: Cannot do that tho
[17:57:19] <gtlsgamr> Tor[m]: why?
[17:57:23] <Tor[m]> Only tree where they rest plus they have nest
[17:57:24] <mxbl> https://weechat.org/files/doc/stable/weechat_quickstart.en.html
[17:57:30] <NatuKaka> Title: WeeChat quick start guide (at weechat.org)
[17:58:36] <mxbl> weechat supports other protocols too, like matrix
[17:58:38] <mxbl> even discord
[18:36:37] <Zbnssn[m]> <mxbl> "don't use a binary for kernel" <- Yeah you loose the whole point... I'll prolly install gentoo when I get a powerful processor and probably am into compiling kernels and knowing kernel level operations
[18:39:15] <Zbnssn[m]> Rn arch just werks and am v happy with it productivity wise
[18:46:32] <mxbl> or use distcc

[21:26:09] <JB[m]> hi everyone

[21:41:25] <iamak[m]> Which distro
[21:41:39] <mxbl> which audio server
[21:51:21] <JB[m]> <iamak[m]> "Which distro" <- im on POPos
[21:51:55] <JB[m]> PulseAudio most probably
[21:52:06] <mxbl> pactl info
[21:52:26] <mxbl> it tells you whether you use pipewire or pulse
[21:52:45] <JB[m]> mxbl: pulse

[22:00:13] <JB[m]> no havent yet

[22:01:04] <mxbl> it's a program to control audio devices
[22:01:15] <mxbl> but whatever gets preinstalled on pop should work too
[22:01:42] <JB[m]> mxbl: pop uses gnome
[22:01:48] <JB[m]> gnome doesnt give much control
[22:01:57] <mxbl> then apt install pavucontrol
