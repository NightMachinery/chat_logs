[01:48:56] <amy_ames> hello good afternoon
[01:49:03] <amy_ames> i have what i hope is an easy question
[01:49:09] <amy_ames> we use anope with ldap
[01:49:20] <amy_ames> and would like thelounge to reference our ldap
[01:49:44] <amy_ames> the passwords for our anope users are , i guarantee , in a field thelounge is not expecting them to be in
[01:49:54] <amy_ames> so thats making logins fail
[01:50:17] <amy_ames> and i believe "sub" is not the option i want for scope
[01:50:47] <amy_ames> does anyone one know 1) where i can tell thelounge what field password lives in
[01:51:10] <amy_ames> and 2) what the alternative to "sub" is ? we do not have a sub schema its all in root as its only for IRC
[01:51:13] <amy_ames> thank you
[01:51:56] <amy_ames> (that is to say, the basedn, is already anope.ournetwork.org
[01:52:04] <amy_ames> and userid is a top level field of that
[01:53:02] <amy_ames> currently thelounge says "failed for non existent user"
[01:53:13] <amy_ames> which i believe is due to sub being an unwanted parameter
[01:53:22] <amy_ames> ... the password will be the next problem
[02:01:11] <amy_ames> does anyone know what field its checking, if its perhaps userPassword ?

[03:40:24] <amy_ames> its okay im using a clone of our system in oracle virtualbox
[03:40:32] <amy_ames> i have not changed the production on people are on
[03:40:42] <kode54> ah, that's always a great idea
[03:40:56] <amy_ames> we're testing an upgrade to 4.3.0 and when i can solve this , we will upgrade the real servers people actually use
[03:41:24] <amy_ames> but there are HUGE differences in the ldap behavior in 4.3.0 that i cant parse , and ldap.js isnt even there anymore
[03:41:33] <amy_ames> all new names and routines for all of it :)
[03:41:39] <kode54> how convenient
[03:42:03] <amy_ames> the old stuff is very .. thoroughly discussed, documented, debated
[03:42:15] <kode54> wish I knew enough to help out
[03:42:29] <amy_ames> ty for replying at all ;)
[03:42:49] <amy_ames> its saturday night i know you have 2-3 extremely good ldap people out there
[03:43:01] <amy_ames> they will see it eventually!
[03:43:04] <kode54> yup
[03:43:14] <kode54> good to know you're not the type to just ask and disappear
[03:43:38] <kode54> I've seen too many people do that
[03:43:46] <MaxLeiter> amy_ames: I'm not too familiar with LDAP, but the file you mention is here: https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/blob/0fb6dae8a68627cd7747ea6164ebe93390fe90f2/src/plugins/auth/ldap.js
[03:44:10] <MaxLeiter> And the thorough issue is appreciated, the chance someone can help is far higher because of it
[03:44:28] <kode54> ah goody, you're online
[03:44:29] <amy_ames> thank you max, i am vaguely familiar with that one and , this is a clean install of the debian release, i cant find the ldap.js at all
[03:44:41] <amy_ames> does this mean i need to edit that and build from source?
[03:44:51] <MaxLeiter> Yeah, you shouldn't mess with the code in a packaged version, you'll need to build from source
[03:44:54] <amy_ames> im okay with that, thats how our old boxes are made
[03:44:55] <MaxLeiter> ^ yes
[03:44:56] <amy_ames> ah ha!
[03:45:01] <amy_ames> that is why i cannot find ldap.js
[03:45:23] <amy_ames> thank you!!! yes, we modified it on our old version built from src
[03:45:26] <kode54> yeah, built copies minify a lot of the source, at least the client side stuff
[03:46:27] <kode54> I wasn't aware there was minification going on with the server side scripts as well
[03:47:39] <MaxLeiter> kode54: there isnt, but if you're making changes you should still build from source 
[03:50:09] <amy_ames> ^
[03:50:17] <amy_ames> i did not know about the minification
[03:50:22] <amy_ames> thats been blocking me for 12 hours
[03:50:56] <amy_ames> i updated my own request to say hey this is what IRC said, let me hack ldap.js and if i solve it myself ill share what i did for the next person stuck on this
[03:51:36] <amy_ames> already had to kind of .... hack anope ... as things stand!
[03:51:59] <amy_ames> never ending rabbit hole :D
[03:54:24] <MaxLeiter> good luck!
[03:55:15] <amy_ames> thanks max!
