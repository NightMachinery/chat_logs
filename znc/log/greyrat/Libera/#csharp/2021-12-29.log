[04:37:39] <BtbN> Works fine for me.
[04:37:57] <lz_> oh that could explain it lol https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/7851
[04:38:04] <lz_> "Please, make sure that your .wslconfig file is UTF8 file and end of lines are LF. "
[04:38:34] <brianonymous> oh shit, im only running ubuntu 18.04
[04:39:19] <brianonymous> is that an easy update
[04:40:03] <bpmedley> I would google before I upgraded.  May need to double or triple jump and do the upgrade..
[04:40:22] <brianonymous> sounds exhausting
[04:40:45] <bpmedley> Last time I did an ubuntu upgrade it took around 15 minutes
[04:41:10] <brianonymous> i just wanna make sure it wouldnt be like a repave
[04:41:20] <lz_> fml I still cant change wsl2's memory
[04:41:27] <bpmedley> I'm not sure.  I would need to google..
[04:42:14] <brianonymous> yeah, ill save that fun for a later day
[04:42:44] <lz_> ah it's working now
[04:44:01] <lz_> funny because the other day I had a weird cuda error I didn't understand and I ended up installing linux
[04:44:10] <lz_> now I think it was just an OOM
[04:44:42] <lz_> "RuntimeError: CUDA error: unknown error"
[04:44:43] <lz_> super helpful
[04:45:18] <brianonymous> i ran into some crazy shit like that just a few weeks ago when the build pipeline accidently crapped out a 32bit binary
[04:46:06] <brianonymous> it kept OOM popping, but all my metrics data were well in spec..... for x64
[04:46:57] <brianonymous> i didnt even realize what was going on until i tried to do a gcdump with the 64bit sdk
[04:47:50] <brianonymous> funtimes funtimes
[04:48:00] <lz_> i remember a heated debate about x86 I had in here
[04:48:12] <lz_> someone was telling me how no one was using it lol
[04:48:29] <brianonymous> i have some systems that have no choice, due to 32bit external libraries
[04:48:56] <lz_> anyway i still oom :(
[04:49:13] <lz_> maybe it's my gpu
[04:49:18] <lz_> i have no clue what im doin

[08:23:54] <JakeSays> damn wanking bitches
[08:25:29] <JakeSays> brianonymous: upgrading ubuntu is worse than slamming your dick in a car door
[08:35:41] <Slade> JakeSays, no its not
[08:36:29] <Slade> unless you're slamming your dick in a car door as part of your weird JakeSays specific authentication process
[08:40:51] <Slade> are you trying to do something like custom package paths while moving from LTS to non-lts or something
[08:43:18] <JakeSays> Slade: moving from lts to lts is a nightmare. when i went from 18.4 to 20.4 it took me two days. 3 hours for the update, 2d - 3h to fix it.
[08:43:44] <Slade> JakeSays, huh, took me less than 15 minutes
[08:43:46] <JakeSays> and every time it updates the kernel it destroys my grub config
[08:44:58] <JakeSays> although going from 20.04 to 21.04 was less painful
[08:45:14] <Slade> you need special grub?
[08:45:34] <JakeSays> well, the only thing that us 'unusual' is zfs
[08:45:46] <JakeSays> but ubuntu is supposed to be the big zfs distro
[08:46:11] <Slade> so your upgrade command should be something like  --   cp -a /boot/grub/grub{.cfg,.bak} ;  apt update && sudo apt upgrade ; cp -a /boot/grub/grub{.bak,.cfg} ;  rm -f /boot/grub/grub.bak
[08:46:15] <JakeSays> one of these days i'll dig in to it
[08:46:22] <Slade> but yea that sounds weird
[08:46:56] <JakeSays> Slade: lol that's my workflow. i don't script it though.
[08:47:11] <Slade> sounds ok
[08:47:50] <JakeSays> the grub config process is a fucking mess
[08:47:54] <JakeSays> total cluster fuck
[08:48:55] <JakeSays> but then it's linux so not un-expected
[08:49:04] <bomb> you're a grown ass man, still using Ubuntu
[08:50:01] <JakeSays> bomb: it's called inertia
[08:50:53] <bomb> if you're fine with 9-month upgrade cycle, Fedora is doing good in the last few years
[08:50:54] <Slade> anyhow, i'm not really distro biased, but a perk for me about ubuntu has been its ultra easy upgrade processes
[08:52:32] <JakeSays> bomb: i only upgrade ubuntu no more frequently than once a year

[09:20:50] <_genuser_> reading up on all this NFT stuff. A Serum token sold for 3.4million lately.
[09:20:54] <_genuser_> it's gotten a little crazy
[09:23:10] <JakeSays> even melania trump is getting in on it
[09:23:40] <_genuser_> oh I missed that news from the regular crypto news website I read
[09:25:21] <_genuser_> JakeSays dude, she launched her NFT line and then a platform. interesting.
[09:26:09] <_genuser_> JakeSays the BAYC NFTs are basically 150k+. Some for millions. The mutant ape yatch club collection is also already super expensive. crypto punks are also super expensive.
[09:26:10] <_genuser_> crazy.
[09:26:11] <JakeSays> if crypto needed something to give it a bad name, association with anything trump would do it
[09:26:24] <_genuser_> lol. imo, crypto will be fine.
[09:27:04] <_genuser_> melania's line will probably be gobbled up by businesses who want to quietly bet on increasing value. (money making is politics-neutral). Plus the actual fans.
[09:27:30] <_genuser_> I was watching a new business saying they'll allow people to put up their NFT collection as collateral to borrow money against it.
[09:27:48] <_genuser_> similar to how the rich people put up their stock portfolio as collateral and live on the loans.
[09:28:22] <_genuser_> which as an added benefit doesn't show up as income, because it's a loan. So no taxes. I'm not super clean on how most of them pay those loans back. Probably from dividends, etc. etc.

[12:03:39] <biberu> https://source.dot.net/#System.Private.CoreLib/StringBuilder.cs,853
[12:05:15] <biberu> looks like both would just be treated as char *, i doubt you'd gain anything that warrants the extra complexity (now you need two tests and extra brain power for that section)
[12:05:29] <MatthiasVance> Yeah, it's already using unsafe access to the string
[12:05:51] <biberu> fwiw, that span could be simplified, now you're first creating a span and then immediately slicing it, to create another
[12:06:14] <biberu> there's an overload for .AsSpan(start, length) that avoids that

[15:58:13] <Nasp> I've just often wondered what kind of stuff you could use GPU's for
[15:58:23] <Nasp> For ML.net what i really want is a way to parallelize training
[15:58:32] <Nasp> Because it seems to easily take forever
[15:58:47] <MatthiasVance> They are wayyy faster for certain tasks
[15:58:52] <MatthiasVance> Same reason why you use one for gaming
[15:58:57] <MatthiasVance> Vector calculations probably?
[15:59:11] <Nasp> We just had this text -> category ml scenario
[15:59:19] <Nasp> But we ended up completely removing our own solution :(
[15:59:30] <Nasp> And the newer way takes like days to train
[16:00:22] <MatthiasVance> Oh
[16:00:37] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Is it a full new training scenario or "refitting" or whatever it's called
[16:00:56] <Nasp> Well the people who made it has a kinda ml model trained
[16:01:01] <Nasp> And we just apply it data really
[16:01:06] <Nasp> So we input X and say we expect Y
[16:01:13] <Nasp> And then we train it that way
[16:01:17] <Nasp> Quite generic really
[16:12:43] <kobo> we're "rewriting" an old monolith, and I'm thinking this kinda structure: frontend - .net core api - .net core class lib - mssql server
[16:13:25] <kobo> and just keep all logic in the .net core class lib, so kinda only 2 .net projects, do you guys think that will suffice?
[16:17:29] <Nasp> How's the existing monoliths structure?
[16:17:37] <Nasp> And are you rewriting it or just "upgrading" it
[16:18:08] <Nasp> Also did you mean Frontend, API, libs (which contains database stuff) ?
[16:21:10] <kobo> Nasp, webforms, with bunch of projects and "layers" which just seem to confuse..
[16:21:29] <Nasp> Also frontend as in some SPA stuff i take it?
[16:21:32] <kobo> Frontend - js css html which will do http calls to the .net core api
[16:21:33] <Nasp> But yeah it sounds reasonable
[16:21:41] <Nasp> Also no reason to restrict yourself to not having multiple class libs
[16:21:46] <kobo> yeh we're looking at "micro frontends" kinda
[16:22:02] <Nasp> Well that's a totally different thing
[16:22:20] <kobo> Well that's just for the frontends
[16:22:20] <Nasp> Also is it a completely rewrite from scratch?
[16:22:23] <Nasp> Ahh
[16:22:39] <kobo> Nasp, ye it's a rewrite, but we're taking one piece at a time
[16:22:40] <Nasp> Well if you need micro frontends you probably also need micro services
[16:22:48] <Nasp> Not that those two are related, but just if the project is really that big
[16:23:08] <kobo> Nah we're not doing microservices, we're too small of a team to handle that complexity
[16:23:21] <Nasp> How small a team?
[16:23:33] <kobo> depends on how many contractors they decide to take in... 5-10
[16:23:58] <Nasp> We were 6 devs when we decided to do microservices
[16:24:06] <kobo> good choice?
[16:24:06] <Nasp> Ohh contractors
[16:24:08] <Nasp> Yes
[16:24:13] <Nasp> It boosted productivity a lot
[16:24:23] <kobo> I have a feeling that the pendulum is about to turn regarding microservices
[16:24:27] <Nasp> We got time to test it out and management was like "That isn't going to yield anything"
[16:24:47] <Nasp> But productivity was so much higher, just crank out a microservice in minutes if you really wanted to
[16:24:55] <Nasp> Back to monoliths?
[16:25:25] <kobo> Nasp, kinda...
[16:25:30] <Nasp> I dont think so
[16:25:31] <kobo> This is an interesting read https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29576352
[16:25:36] <kobo> the comment section that is
[16:26:05] <kobo> I mean we have some microservices, like we keep customer data in a separate microservice
[16:26:17] <Nasp> We have 200 controllers just in our monolith
[16:26:32] <Nasp> With the micro services even more so, i wouldn't imagine it  being able to compile if we had to put it all in the same solution
[16:26:45] <Nasp> You easily end up with compile time that takes minutes
[16:27:06] <kobo> is that still the case with .net core? I thought it was getting smarter with the compiletimes
[16:27:32] <Nasp> I dunno, i am not done with my rewrite :D
[16:27:40] <Nasp> It will soon run on .NET 5
[16:27:54] <Nasp> But i dont think it's that much faster really

[16:28:26] <Nasp> Might ahve been better in some ways to not make multiple projects, since the dependency chain limits the compile speed
[16:28:36] <Nasp> But in other ways it's divided up a bit so it's "maybe" easier to split out
[16:29:08] <kobo> Yeah, my idea was to just have 2 projects really.. api with controllers and then the business logic/db calls
[16:29:15] <Nasp> But how many are the existing one?
[16:29:35] <Nasp> And will you rewrite it, or just copy and paste all the existing code or

[16:35:40] <Nasp> I dont think that should be a limiting factor
[16:36:14] <Nasp> And i think you should consider and identify if certain parts could be a microservice

[16:36:43] <Nasp> It's not part of the core domain

[16:50:07] <MatthiasVance> And own their data!
[16:50:36] <MatthiasVance> (or not, just use whatever makes sense and gives you the best solution for your problem :D)

[16:54:46] <Nasp> Also "micro" is just the new fancy way of saying service oriented really

[21:07:30] <brianonymous> sysRPL: sorry, the fib.c specifically
[21:09:55] <sysRPL> brianonymous: yeah that example is not creating a js runtime or a js context
[21:10:14] <sysRPL> and it's not executing js
[21:10:16] <brianonymous> i think its only purpose is to insert a c func as a js func
[21:10:21] <sysRPL> right
[21:10:38] <brianonymous> oh, then i might just be misunderstanding what you were looking for
