[13:03:33] <fakuve> Hi guys , yeah I know in here most of you want to stick to vanilla `vim` as much as possible . But when dealing with coding projects such as the projects subdirectory structure starts to get complicated and navitaging through it becomes an essential part as important as navigating through text . What is your personal choice on workflow?
[13:04:08] <mgedmin> I like command-t.vim and NERDTree
[13:04:18] <mgedmin> and also fugitive for :Ggrep
[13:04:21] <fakuve> I'm tabbing vim , so I can open up different documents , and that is cool , but some people are using `nertree`
[13:04:23] <fakuve> ok
[13:04:49] <mgedmin> plus ctags (which gutentags helps me keep up-to-date)
[13:05:07] <fakuve> oks alright
[13:05:14] <fakuve> mgedmin: I will check into those thanks
[13:05:19] *** gggpkm_ is now known as gggpkm

[13:05:37] <mgedmin> then I have a couple of custom plugins for quickly switching between unit tests and source code (making certain assumptions about directory structure)
[13:06:35] <fakuve> ok I'm gonna get started with those , and I will be back
[13:06:37] <mgedmin> and one for parsing various traceback formats to find the source file + line, adjusted for possibly different directory prefixes (on a server vs my local source tree)
[13:07:09] <fakuve> oks
[13:07:11] <mgedmin> so debugging becomes tripple-click a traceback line in a terminal/browser, switch to vim, hit <F7> (mapped to :ClipboardTest)
[13:07:46] <mgedmin> my vimrc with all the plugins is at https://github.com/mgedmin/dotvim/ if you're bored and want to take a look
[13:08:22] <fakuve> ok thanks a lot
[13:09:36] <furrymcgee> try :edit . it is a simple directory browser in vanilla vim
[13:10:28] <mgedmin> (it's also called netrw.vim)
[13:11:16] <furrymcgee> check autochangedir, vimgrep and copen

[14:11:40] <fakuve> Hey anyone using `netrw` ? I'm trying to follow a directory and set it up as my current working directory
[14:12:02] <fakuve> Accoding to the manual this should be done with `c`
[14:12:20] <fakuve> but `netrw-c : This map's name has been changed from "c" to cd (see netrw-cd).`
[14:12:36] <fakuve> anyways neither of those are working
[14:13:06] <mgedmin> 'cd' should be working
[14:13:20] *** Joins: kurkale6ka (~kurkale6k@185.218.121.220)
[14:13:44] <mgedmin> it's confusing the way it talks about a "map's name", when it's the mapping itself that has been changed in some netrw version
[14:14:09] <fakuve> yep they should update that
[14:14:30] <fakuve> but for me is not woking, pressing c followed by `d` all it does its attempt to create a new directory
[14:14:40] <fakuve> (so it only detects the `d`)
[14:15:06] <fakuve> I may have something in my `vimrc` that blocks that behaviour? hopefully not
[14:15:26] <mgedmin> do you have a very short 'timeoutlen' or something?
[14:15:52] <fakuve> let me check that
[14:16:10] <mgedmin> if you :set showcmd and press c, do you see it hanging there on the bottom-right of the screen, waiting for the next key?
[14:16:14] <fakuve> is that for in between letter and letter keypress? to do a key combination
[14:17:27] <fakuve> If I :set showcmd , then I press c nothing happens (this is whith netrw opened0

[14:24:02] <mgedmin> maybe check if a mapping exists with :map c in a netrw window?
[14:24:03] <fakuve> I may have unsetted the c in my vimrc or something like that I guess
[14:24:21] <mgedmin> I get a bunch of mappings, the first of which is `n  cd           @<Plug>NetrwLcd`

[14:27:51] <mgedmin> your vim was built in 2018, it could plausibly have an old netrw

[16:33:06] <habamax> I am thinking if your Variant: 2 is worth including into all built-ins, moshe
[16:33:41] <moshe> t_Co=0 breaks if it's not there, I documented that in the comments

[22:19:29] <romainl> it's way too noisy for day-to-day usage
[22:20:20] <habamax> romainl: i mean not exactly bruin but a mix of it and monochrome of moshe where  only bold comments are highlighted

[22:21:21] <moshe> yeah the vt100 as a baseline thing is a hard restriction on my part, both because of the classic wHaT aRe ItAlIcS bullshit, and because I have to pretend I'm an actual vt100 on some solaris boxes I use
[22:21:32] <habamax> should not be that noisy, and I picture myself smth like borland delphi :)

[22:23:02] <romainl> looks easy enough to make
[22:23:14] <habamax> or this https://smartmobilestudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Delphi7IDE_SC.jpg with italic comments
[22:23:15] <moshe> yeah monosvkem used to look like  that a few years ago, if you go dig inside the repo you should find it
[22:23:33] <moshe> me and my stupid names
[22:23:52] <habamax> the thing is that monochrome could use it for gui and degrade to what it is now for tui
[22:24:07] <moshe> yeah but then people would have a different experience
[22:24:49] <habamax> that is true, but they already have it with all colorschemes in the repo
[22:25:05] <habamax> moshe, again, I am not insisting at all
[22:25:32] *** Joins: Fernando-Basso (~fernandob@2001:470:69fc:105::d1d4)
[22:26:22] <moshe> I mean, one one hand as I said I'd like my stuff to work the same everywhere, and generally speaking I don't think shipping 50 new colorschemes would do anyone any good, but on the other hand if you want to have a look at monosvkem, or use any of my stuff as a baseline for something that will end up being a different enough experience, be my guest
[22:26:49] <moshe> I'm just trying to fill a niche that, admittedly, is as far as I know only populated by little old moi
[22:27:08] <habamax> I would add this to your monochrome, to be more widely used in the end, if you don't mind ofc

[22:27:58] <moshe> I don't know if it'd be more widely used, and if you want to add colors and stuff, github.com/neutaaaaan/monosvkem would probably be a better starting point
[22:28:14] <habamax> no, no colors
[22:28:34] <habamax> just "more regular" italicized comments and bold statements :)
[22:28:34] <moshe> make the thing actually different, instead of basically pasting the same 2 tweaks users could do on their own
[22:29:35] <moshe> or we could have those things on toggles, I don't mind, as long as they're not brittlODODODODODODODODODODODODODODODODODODODe
