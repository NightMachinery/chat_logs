[00:56:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> It seems like we're being asked to make an assumption which is not actually entailed by the structure of the input data?
[00:57:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> But it's not explicitly called out either?
[00:59:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> e.g. the part that says "For this example, assume scanners only need 3 overlapping beacons. Then, the beacons visible to both scanners overlap to produce the following complete map:" ... where does that conclusion come from?? Maybe they're totally different beacons that just happen to have the same relative positions to each other? Are we supposed to assume that definitely can't happen or what?
[00:59:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, the problem statement is incomplete without that assumption, isn't it?

[01:54:00] <feepbot> <gwern> 'To establish the potential of senescent cell elimination to extend the remaining lifespan of WT mice, we performed PCC1 treatment beginning at a very old age (Fig. 8k). Mice receiving PCC1 administration (once every 2 weeks or biweekly) starting at 24–27 months of age (roughly equivalent to an age of 75–90 years in humans) had a 64.2% longer median post-treatment

[01:56:48] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : "Ark Invest founder Cathie Wood recently gave an interview where she compares the current state of China's economy to the Japanese real estate bubble in 1989. After the Japanese bubble burst, the economy stagnated for the following 30 years and their stock market has not recovered to the peak bubble levels. China is currently in its own real estate bubble which is now beginning to burst."
[01:57:21] <two2thehead> Nice to see relatively more and more people are comparing China now to Japan in the 1990s
[01:57:46] <two2thehead> Now the question is, can China politically tolerate a lost decade?
[02:01:04] <gwern> I bet they can. all the cool totalitarian tech, propaganda, ability to make scapegoats, and the general placidity of late-stage east asian societies
[02:02:27] <kuudes> as long as they stay in china, :-/
[02:02:31] <two2thehead> hmm (.___.)?
[02:02:37] <gwern> they have no choice but to stay
[02:02:47] <kuudes> they could start warring with taiwan, russia, japan
[02:02:52] <two2thehead> I dunno, there have been *quite* a lot of internal corruption scandals
[02:03:17] <gwern> kuudes: none of whom particularly want a war or can/would prosecute it very far
[02:03:43] <kuudes> well yes, if they start such, the world should shut them down
[02:04:25] <kuudes> but yeah, it seems to me that we are returning to pre-90s currently
[02:04:35] <kuudes> ie to situation with much less of international trade and travel
[02:04:59] <two2thehead> that is actually a good question to ask
[02:05:31] <two2thehead> "Are we going back to the 1990s in terms of trade?" Travel, almost certainly less.
[02:06:09] <adiabatic> >the world would stop china having a war
[02:06:14] <adiabatic> literally who would bother
[02:07:45] <gwern> (in terms of 'society falling', starting a fight with taiwan/russia/japan is a non-issue. taiwan and japan can't even in theory invade, and russia might hypothetically have the army but wouldn't do it, they can't even populate their hinterland as it is. so the fallout would be, like, Xi being forced into retirement by his furious fellow mandarins)
[02:08:46] <two2thehead> gwern, I think you're misunderstanding kuudes's point. He meant that the CCP would make up a reason to start a short term conflagration to distract the citizenry
[02:09:11] <gwern> oh. then yeah sure that's an option they definitely have, because there's no one who can make them pay a real price
[02:09:18] <two2thehead> yep
[02:10:20] <kuudes> usa could?
[02:10:59] <kuudes> and I am fastforwarding and presuming that one way or another, trade between oecd and china might have went to under 50% of 2019 level in 2023 I guess
[02:11:10] <two2thehead> kuudes, nitpick. CCP could do what Iran does, rely heavily on plausible deniability
[02:11:22] <kuudes> they don't want to

[02:22:34] <Gurkenglas> I noticed during that his support of the protest yesterday was... not in the manner of a rationalist
[02:22:45] <Gurkenglas> -during that
[02:22:53] <two2thehead> "With the widespread adoption of masks, there is a need for understanding how facial obstruction affects emotion recognition. We asked 120 participants to identify emotions from faces with and without masks. We also examined if recognition performance was related to autistic traits and personality. Masks impacted recognition of expressions with diagnostic lower face features the most and those with diagnostic upper face features the least. Persons 
[02:22:53] <two2thehead> with higher autistic traits were worse at identifying unmasked expressions, while persons with lower extraversion and higher agreeableness were better at recognizing masked expressions. These results show that different features play different roles in emotion recognition and suggest that obscuring features affects social communication differently as a function of autistic traits and personality."
[02:23:29] <two2thehead> Could be a subtest for autism. A sort of differential diagnosis, or maybe more datum points to rely on

[09:47:29] <spxtr> does 100% chocolate means no butter, only beans? or just no added sugar or milk or whatever?
[09:48:06] <spxtr> I feel like I've had something labelled 100% and it was pretty good
[09:54:59] <Ralith> no significant quantity of cocoa butter
[09:55:03] <Ralith> if it was good, it wasn't 100%
[09:55:13] <Ralith> 100% is like a spoonful of cocoa powder
[09:55:29] <PapuaHardyNet> I used to have jars of 100% cocoa powder in my uni dorm
[09:55:32] <Ralith> (not to be confused with hot chocolate mix)
[09:55:41] <PapuaHardyNet> Used to mix it with my protein shake
[09:55:46] <PapuaHardyNet> was not fun lmao
[09:56:22] <spxtr> does it even hold together in bar form at true 100%? seems like the butter is necessary to make a bar
[09:57:38] <Ralith> I mean, it's a bar
[09:57:57] <Ralith> maybe if you grind up the bar you get powder? maybe it's a different crystal phase or something? chocolate has lots of those
[09:58:29] <Ralith> maybe it only takes 0.01% fat to make it stick together
[09:58:49] <spxtr> I bet there's some 0.01% fat holding it together
[09:58:56] <spxtr> I'll ask my advisor he's crazy about chocolate
[09:59:22] <Ralith> seems as plausible as anything

[15:35:14] <two2thehead> gwern, re ycomb nocom huh
[15:45:23] <two2thehead> "This is an exploit for a very old Minecraft server (called 2b2t) where griefing (destroying other creations) and hacking is basically allowed. This kind of environment means that groups of players are incentivized to hide their projects out in the middle of nowhere, hundreds of thousands of blocks away from the world origin coordinates. The exploit allows a client to ask the server if data chunks at arbitrary coordinates have player activity in 
[15:45:23] <two2thehead> them, opening the server up to a brute force search to locate well-hidden bases.
[15:45:23] <two2thehead> "Basically, a group got spy satellites in an anarchy Minecraft server where remaining hidden is critical to not being destroyed."
[15:45:37] <two2thehead> gwern, you dark forest comparison is quite apt
[15:45:39] <two2thehead> gwern, +1
[15:48:20] <two2thehead> "Yes, so Minecraft is exactly that. Any "I have mined this block" further than 6 blocks away from the player is ignored. The problem is that on a laggy server, an honest client can end up sending this, if the server lags out for more than 6 blocks of walking your player forward. So, Paper added a patch to undo these disallowed mines, setting them back to what they were. But this happened at any radius, and could be used to lag the server by making 
[15:48:20] <two2thehead> it generate any region. Then they patched it again and made it only reply if it were in a loaded chunk. The mistake was that it replies if the coordinate is in a chunk loaded by any player, not just by your player. :)"

Gliding their way into the dining area on four wheels, the cadre of one-armed creatures weave through a maze of tables. Like hunters stalking prey, they swivel their binocular-sized heads, staring at their surroundings through an array of cameras and sensors. Additional vision is supplied by a Lidar sensor, similar to those on

But those images are low-resolution or only in two dimensions. LOFAR, a state-of-the-art astronomical telescope, can map lighting on a meter-by-meter scale in three dimensions, and with a frame rate 200 times faster than previous instruments could
[22:03:54] <feepbot> achieve. “The LOFAR measurements are giving us the first really clear picture of what’s happening inside the thunderstorm,” said Dwyer...When the researchers analyzed the data from the August 2018 lightning flash, they saw that the radio pulses all emanated from a 70-meter-wide region deep inside the storm cloud. They quickly inferred that the pattern of pulses supports one
[22:03:54] <feepbot> of the two leading theories about how the most common type of lightning gets started. One idea holds that cosmic rays — particles from outer space — collide with electrons inside thunderstorms, triggering electron avalanches that strengthen the electric fields. The new observations point to the rival theory. It starts with clusters of ice crystals inside the cloud. Turbulent
[22:03:59] <feepbot> collisions between the needle-shaped crystals brush off some of their electrons, leaving one end of each ice crystal positively charged and the other negatively charged. The positive end draws electrons from nearby air molecules. More electrons flow in from air molecules that are farther away, forming ribbons of ionized air that extend from each ice crystal tip. These are called
[22:03:59] <feepbot> streamers. Each crystal tip gives rise to hordes of streamers, with individual streamers branching off again and again. The streamers heat the surrounding air, ripping electrons from air molecules en masse so that a larger current flows onto the ice crystals.

[23:21:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I recall a disturbing conversation I had last year, where a friend (A) and I were talking to two others (B and C) on the phone. Friend A and I had detected that the conversation had a “vibe” of not investigating anything, and A was asking whether anyone would investigate if A disappeared. B and C repeatedly gave no answer regarding whether or not they would investigate; one reported later that they were afraid of making a
[23:21:54] <Obormot\Arcturus>  commitment that they would not actually keep. The situation became increasingly disturbing over the course of hours, with A repeatedly asking for a yes-or-no answer as to whether B or C would investigate, and B or C deflecting or giving no answer, until I got “triggered” (in the sense of PTSD) and screamed loudly."
[23:22:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> The real problem is that you were talking to 3 other people on the fucking phone for hours
[23:22:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> And about some bullshit, too
[23:22:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Really quite amazing how this post casually drops the most ridiculous stuff
[23:23:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> "There is a very disturbing possibility (with some evidence for it) here, that people may be picked off one by one (by partially-subconscious and partially-memetic influences, sometimes in ways they cooperate with, e.g. through suicide), with most everyone being too scared to investigate the circumstances. This recalls fascist tactics of picking different groups of people off using the support of people who will only be picked
[23:23:33] <Obormot\Arcturus>  off later." ... but what if: stop doing so much fucking drugs, you idiots

[23:25:02] <spxtr> That is a good anime, despite the awful animation.

[23:25:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Some people in the community have died, and there isn’t a notable amount of investigation into the circumstances of these people’s deaths. The dead people are, effectively, being written out of other people’s memories, due to this antimemetic redirection of attention."
