[03:30:31] <FromGitter> <franpenedo:matrix.org> was `undo-tree-auto-save-history` been set as default recently or am I just imagining it?
[03:39:37] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> I'd suggest you to ask lsp-mode's people. They have a discord server.
[03:39:59] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> as for undo-tree, I suspect it's some upstream changes...
[03:44:27] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> I'd say the problem with undo-tree started within 2 weeks (or even just last week)
[04:30:51] <FromGitter> <franpenedo:matrix.org> I see, thanks. It's surprisingly annoying since the history files are picked up by helm

[22:13:40] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> > Doing SPC h d f doesn't short Shift-Right for org-shiftright when I know it is bound to that

[22:15:39] <FromGitter> <drpastah:matrix.org> no it's not because Shift-Rightarrow doesn't show up in describe function of `org-shiftright`, meaning I cannot see all keybinds for `org-shiftright`
