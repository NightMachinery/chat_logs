[01:04:27] <nimaje> well you could use a user stylesheet to hide that element, but as qb only* has a global setting for stylesheets it would affect all websites so use with care (* you can use greasemonkey scripts to add css rules to pages and so emulate per site user stylesheets)

I think it's because there is no html file extension on those temp files. my question is: is there a way to display such a

[17:33:31] <Voidwarper> Has qutebrowser implemented a command to clear history and cookies of everything yet? 
[17:33:54] <Voidwarper> I remember this is why I went back to chromium when I last tried qutebrowser. 
[17:34:20] <Voidwarper> (that and because I couldn't use Netflix with drm) 
[17:34:40] <ThinkT510> tried :history-clear ?
[17:35:01] <Voidwarper> Oh I remember that command 
[17:35:11] <Voidwarper> But sites still remembered me as well 
[17:35:20] <Voidwarper> Probably need the cookie clear only then 
[17:46:51] <The-Compiler> Voidwarper: you can clear individual cookies via :devtools, or clear all of them by quitting qutebrowser and removing webengine/Cookies in its data dir (see :version). Nothing changed about that in a long time.
[17:47:50] <Voidwarper> The-Compiler: I didn't know about :devtools
[17:48:02] <Voidwarper> Or you mean chrome dev tools 
[17:48:11] <Voidwarper> To delete from a single page 
[17:49:05] <The-Compiler> Voidwarper: :devtools open the Chromium devtools (used to be :inspector in earlier versions)
[17:49:35] <Voidwarper> Oh I see. Also there used to be a way to load widevine for drm. Does this work anymore? 
[17:50:30] <The-Compiler> it should, as long as you have the proper version installed
[17:50:57] <Voidwarper> Alright thanks 
[17:50:58] <The-Compiler> nothing special qutebrowser does about that though, that's just the underlying QtWebEngine/Chromium
[17:51:27] <Voidwarper> Also trivial question, but is qtwebengine a fork of chromium blink engine? 
[17:51:43] <Voidwarper> Or completely different. Hard to understand from their site 
[17:52:16] <Voidwarper> And for Javascript is v8 used? Couldn't find info on that also

[17:53:23] <The-Compiler> QtWebEngine is a fork of (a subset of) Chromium if you will
[17:53:39] <The-Compiler> including Blink and v8, but also e.g. the Chromium network stack

[17:54:56] <Voidwarper> Oh that's good. I asked because I saw spidermonkey somewhere in qutebrowser and I thought this is Firefox js engine. 
[17:55:23] <The-Compiler> so QtWebEngine essentially takes a snapshot of Chromium (which is updated with every Qt release), then builds a stable API around it, and backports security patches and such
[17:55:49] <Voidwarper> Also since it seems compatible with chromium and the dev tools are there, I might use this for web dev instead of chromium. 
[17:55:54] <Voidwarper> I see
[17:56:06] <The-Compiler> huh, I don't see where you would see Spidermonkey
[17:56:20] <Voidwarper> Maybe I imagined it or something. Haha
[17:57:08] <Voidwarper> Anyway great work on qutebrowser. It's my go to, since I use tiling window managers with vim keybindings. 
[17:57:30] <The-Compiler> would be nice if there was something based on Gecko/Firefox qutebrowser could use as an alternative (it has an abstraction layer over the QtWebEngine backend), but no suitable alternative really exists unfortunately

[18:00:18] <Voidwarper> The-Compiler: what wrong with the chromium base? 
[18:00:27] <Voidwarper> Does it lack something? 
[18:00:53] <ThinkT510> it effectively means google dictates web standards
[18:00:55] *** Joins: guido (~weechat@host-82-59-223-88.retail.telecomitalia.it)
[18:01:01] <The-Compiler> nothing really came out of various discussions about making servo embeddable, and with Mozilla IIRC laying off the entire Servo team, I don't see a very bright future for it, though I'd love to be proven wrong
[18:01:13] <Voidwarper> Also seems more performant on benchmarks, and most web devs usually check Chrome first and Firefox as an afterthought 
[18:01:52] <tiosgz`> "Chrome first and Firefox as an afterthought" <-- that's exactly the problem
[18:02:00] <The-Compiler> Voidwarper: I mean, having an alternative choice would be good even just for qutebrowser - even if it's just for things like checking whether a bug is in qutebrowser or QtWebEngine

[18:02:44] <Voidwarper> but isn't Chrome open source? Does Google really control the web with it? 
[18:03:06] <ThinkT510> chromium is open source. chrome is no
[18:03:10] <ThinkT510> not
[18:03:13] <Voidwarper> Also shouldn't be some standardization anyway? Every browser implements things differently and it's chaos developing 
[18:03:15] <The-Compiler> Voidwarper: and finally, there are some users who can't really use QtWebEngine for legitimate (e.g. issues with certain graphic drivers) or less legitimate (omg non-free!) reasons
[18:03:25] <tiosgz`> it's got de facto monopoly. google doesn't have to wait for standards, it pushes them as it wants to
[18:03:27] <The-Compiler> Voidwarper: there is a lot of standardisaton
[18:03:57] <The-Compiler> but yeah, Google has a rather unfortunate position in that standartisation, like Microsoft had in the IE days
[18:04:05] <ThinkT510> having standards isn't the issue. everyone sicking to them and implementing them properly is
[18:05:24] <Voidwarper> Is qtwebengine non free? 
[18:05:39] <The-Compiler> Voidwarper: Chromium is open source, yes, but its licensing is a mess to the point that some people claim that it's not free software. I don't agree with them in general, but at the same time I wouldn't mind having support for an alternative backend not tied so closely to Google
[18:05:43] <The-Compiler> Voidwarper: depends on whom you ask
[18:06:16] <Voidwarper> From a licensing perspective then. I only care if they put closed source blobs in it or not. 
[18:06:24] <The-Compiler> same answer
[18:07:25] <Voidwarper> Is it subjective if it contains closed source blobs? 
[18:07:33] <The-Compiler> with millions (if not billions) of lines of code, and Google not really caring too much, it's difficult to give a proper answer
[18:08:06] <The-Compiler> but "non free from a licensing perspective" and "contains closed source blobs" are two different things again
[18:08:45] <nimaje> would be nice if you could use netsurfs engine as backend in qb, but afaik that engine is currently just buried in the code and not a standalone project with some api
[18:08:51] <Voidwarper> I see. Well I am not a big fan of Mozilla or Firefox anymore either, with them firing the servo team, the opt out things and telemetry they enable. 
[18:09:10] <Voidwarper> So i don't trust them either that much. 
[18:09:29] <The-Compiler> Voidwarper: and then there is things like https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=786909 which apparently was indeed a honest mistake, but again, depends on whom you ask
[18:09:58] <The-Compiler> yeah, agreed
[18:10:12] <Voidwarper> So these things pass onto qtwebengine? 
[18:10:39] <Voidwarper> I remember some people used to say chromium opens their microphone/camera on its own etc
[18:10:45] <The-Compiler> depends on what part of the code they are in, and whether QtWebEngine developers are aware of it and disabled it
[18:11:12] <The-Compiler> there e.g. used to be a bug for a bit where QtWebEngine automatically downloaded spell check dictionaries from Google
[18:11:45] <Voidwarper> Well I see why you want a gecko based browser now 
[18:12:11] <The-Compiler> but in general, QtWebEngine does a good job at stripping the Google specific bits (of which some remain, even in the open source Chromium part)
[18:13:06] <Voidwarper> I remember qutebrowser also used to have as a backend webkit 
[18:13:16] <Voidwarper> This doesn't work anymore? 
[18:13:33] <The-Compiler> I guess the main thing to realise is that Chromium is an *incredibly* complex and fast-changing software project, and closely tied to Google, so the answer to things like "is it free" can be tricky or not telling the entire picture
[18:14:09] <Voidwarper> So it's open source but Noone reads it 
[18:14:11] <Voidwarper> I see
[18:14:14] <The-Compiler> there are also (non-mainstream) Linux distributions which dispute that Chromium/QtWebEngine is free entirely, and thus ban them from their repositories
[18:14:31] <The-Compiler> I don't find their arguments convincing so far, but still, they exist
[18:15:11] <Voidwarper> There should be a rival engine maintained completely by the community, as it's done with the Linux kernel. 
[18:15:33] <Voidwarper> Would solve the issue of web control, and the spookiness of Google etc 
[18:16:49] <Voidwarper> Companies might have interest supporting that too, as rivals of Google 
[18:17:28] * tiosgz` ambiguously points at servo
[18:18:35] <The-Compiler> Voidwarper: using QtWebKit with qutebrowser still works, but QtWebKit is pretty dead and still based on a Safari from September 2016
[18:19:00] <The-Compiler> so it's not really a suitable alternative at this point, and I'm considering to rip the code out again for v3.0.0
[18:19:12] <Voidwarper> Isn't servo or parts of it supposed to be inside Firefox quantum? 
[18:19:26] <The-Compiler> parts of it, yes
[18:21:24] <The-Compiler> well, some alternatives do exist, but either are not really usable in todays web because they are too immature/exotic (netsurf and others), and/or are not made for integration (Servo/Gecko), and/or are integratable and not aimed at Qt (WebKitGTK)
[18:23:38] <The-Compiler> the only real big alternatives to QtWebEngine I can see are WebKitGTK (GTK), CEF (Chromium too) and Electron (Chromium too and not really for integrating into Qt)
[18:26:04] <Voidwarper> The-Compiler: what about those guanna based browsers? Like basilisk and palemoon. 
[18:26:22] <Voidwarper> How did they integrate that gecko fork 
[18:26:39] <Voidwarper> Also they have access to some sort of extensions similar to Firefox 
[18:27:16] <The-Compiler> those are pretty much a fork of Firefox as far as I understand
[18:27:25] <The-Compiler> as in the entire browser
[18:27:32] <Voidwarper> Oh
[18:29:37] <ThinkT510> decoupling gecko from firefox is no easy task. otherwise we would have plenty of gecko based browsers. instead we just have various entire firefox forks.
[18:34:02] <Voidwarper> https://techdows.com/2015/06/pale-moon-26-to-release-with-goanna-engine-doesnt-uses-gecko.html
[18:34:09] <Voidwarper> How do they change engines then 
[18:34:32] <ThinkT510> goanna is a fork of gecko
[18:34:51] <Voidwarper> http://www.moonchildproductions.info/goanna.shtml
[18:35:00] <Voidwarper> So is it standalone? 
[18:35:11] <Voidwarper> Can it be integrated into qutebrowser? 
[18:35:29] <ThinkT510> it is heavily integrated into palemoon, just like gecko is with firefox
[18:35:50] <nimaje> seems like that article has at least one server error in the first paragraph "Gecko is a fork of Goanna."
[18:36:02] <Voidwarper> It says you have to use the unified xul platform 
[18:36:15] <Voidwarper> Goanna does not have a stand-alone source, since it can't be used as a stand-alone library. If you want to make use of the engine, you can build your application on the Unified XUL Platform (UXP).
[18:36:15] <Voidwarper> The engine is an integral part of that platform, the source of which can be found on GitHub.
[18:37:08] <tiosgz`> iow you can't use qt for the ui
[18:37:21] <ThinkT510> the github link is a 404 for me
[18:37:31] <Voidwarper> Yes it's dead for me also
[18:39:13] <Voidwarper> So qtwebengine is theonly option apparently
[18:40:33] <ThinkT510> so far
[18:40:58] <ThinkT510> feel free to make an independant rendering engine
[18:41:54] <ThinkT510> nyxt is in the same boat as qutebrowser too. designed to be compatible with multiple engines but there really are no other options
[18:42:36] <tiosgz`> afaik nyxt only really works with webkit2gtk
[18:42:47] <tiosgz`> at least i didn't manage to compile it with qtwebengine

[18:42:55] <The-Compiler> Voidwarper: note that "unified XUL platform" means "deep in Mozillas ecosystem", XUL is their "XML User Interface Language"
[18:43:34] <The-Compiler> i.e. you could write a custom browser using that, but it's not really embeddable in something else
[18:43:39] <The-Compiler> (think e.g. Thunderbird)
[18:44:28] <The-Compiler> and so far unfortunately Mozilla wasn't very interested in changing how tightly Gecko is tied to Firefox
[18:45:01] <The-Compiler> with the exception of https://mozilla.github.io/geckoview/ perhaps, but that's Android-only, see https://tridactyl.xyz/ideas/#port-geckoview-to-x86_64
[18:45:35] <Voidwarper> Mozilla is more controlling than Google in the end then
[18:46:02] <Voidwarper> BTW didn't know of nyxt. Looks cool
[18:46:14] <The-Compiler> more likely to be a historical artifact I think
[18:46:32] <tiosgz`> there's a difference between 'controlling' and 'in control'
[18:46:42] <The-Compiler> I guess it's not that they are against it in principle, it's just probably a monumental task without any clear benefits for them
[18:47:58] <Voidwarper> Is webkitgtk upto dateas an
[18:48:08] <Voidwarper> Engine? If webkit is dead
[18:48:39] <The-Compiler> WebKit is not (it's used heavily by Apple for Safari, and also others), and WebKitGTK seems very active and healthy
[18:48:44] <The-Compiler> just QtWebKit is dead
[18:50:17] <The-Compiler> Nyxt has a bit of an advantage over qutebrowser in that it's also independent of the GUI toolkit due to its architecture (from what I understand), but that architecture is questionable from a security standpoint (and a couple of people here indeed found an RCE once I suspected one after reading about how Nyxt works"
