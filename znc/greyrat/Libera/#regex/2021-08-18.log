[11:07:09] <ExeciN> Hi people. I have a note with 41 sets of search strings, substitution strings and whether each of the 3 flags are enabled (match case, match whole word and regex) in the search/replace widget of VSCode.
[11:07:46] <ExeciN> I am trying to use fd + ripgrep wrapped in a bash script to parse all those rules but I'm not sure how to handle the different flag combinations.
[11:08:26] <ExeciN> for example if regex and match whole word are enabled I can just wrap the search string in `\b` but if regex is disabled and match whole word is enabled, I don't know how to handle the search string.
[11:18:54] <ExeciN> How should I handle the situation when regex flag is disabled and match whole word flag is enabled?

[12:12:32] <ExeciN> Me-me: vscode has a find/replace widget that has 3 flags, match case, match whole word and regex. So I was doing a bunch of replacements while noting down the search string, the replacement string and the flag states. I want to take my notes and somehow parse them in my script to perform the same replacements but without any UI clicks. Some of the substitutions are literal (regex flag disabled). If I enable the regex flag for all rules then I have to rewrite all
[12:13:14] <ExeciN> *rewrite all rules that were written with regex flag off
[12:13:58] <Me-me> VSCode - .NET
[12:14:03] <Me-me> Okay. So let me check some things.
[12:14:10] <Me-me> It might be easier to rewrite said rules than you think.
[12:15:58] <ExeciN> about half of the rules are literal, another problem is that if I convert the search string for all rules to work with regex, I have to check if the replacement string needs to be escaped

[12:37:01] <re101-dhole-96> hi , guys . Actually , I can not figure out what this regexp are going to match  .   https://regex101.com/r/gA54Fh/1

[12:38:37] <digitok> bbs, Me-me's in charge
[12:38:42] <Me-me> wat
[12:39:04] <re101-dhole-96> so , it's wrong ? 
[12:39:13] <re101-dhole-96> digitok
[12:40:07] <Me-me> dhole: I haven't looked, but digitok is linking his proposed solution to your problem. If it's wrong, that's up to you to tell him.
[12:40:29] <Me-me> That is, a pattern that does what he thinks your pattern is trying to do.
[12:42:31] <re101-dhole-96> okay then , Thanks very much 
[12:44:18] <Me-me> But to answer your original question, yes, it looks like nothing will match.
[12:44:40] <rapha> digitok: https://regex101.com/r/GE6Kwy/2 ... no dot.
[12:44:46] <Me-me> You have a contradiction in the very first lookaheads in that non-capture group. .[0-9]. and .[A-Za-z]. can't match the same characters.
[12:45:12] <rapha> (i did read your earlier post, but it had me puzzled a little)
[12:45:35] <Me-me> rapha: * is a quantifier that can be applied to any given token. That can mean a specific character, like 'a', a metacharacter like ., a group, or a character class, which is what it's applied to here.
[12:45:46] <Me-me> A character class, by default, only matches one character. * says "0 or more" instead.
[12:49:40] <rapha> Me-me: yes, but is that a character class that says "everything except for a '<'". that's what my question was about.
[12:49:52] <Me-me> That is indeed what that is.
[12:59:12] <re101-dhole-96> it's that mean pattern like  ` (?=<patternA>...)(?=<patternB>...)(?=<patternC>...) ` is like some “And” bool logic operation ， like patternA && patternB patternC  ?  I have never see pattern like this before , so It make me puzzled 
[12:59:40] <re101-dhole-96> Me-me
[12:59:58] <Me-me> Right. Each of them says "after this position, the inner pattern matches" - but doesn't actually advance the "cursor" any farther than when it started.
[13:00:10] <Me-me> For "OR" we use |
[13:00:59] <re101-dhole-96> ok  I do really got it , thank you again~~
[13:01:05] <Me-me> Happy to help.

[13:44:19] <re101-shark-36> Hi all, I want to extract the brand van Assendelft after "Brand " and before the "-" by using a regexp extact. Any ideas? BOL.COM - BRMG - Van Assendelft Outdoor-2 - 300x250_ksg_Brand Van Assendelft - ON-21916
[13:47:40] <rapha> cool :)
[13:49:48] <rapha> re101-shark-36: sorry, your haystack is "BOL.COM - BRMG - Van Assendelft Outdoor-2 - 300x250_ksg_Brand Van Assendelft - ON-21916", and you want to match the second "Van Assendelft"?
[13:50:16] <re101-shark-36> Yes that is correct
[13:50:20] <rapha> And I'm assuming that is only _one_ example?
[13:50:45] <re101-shark-36> I want to have the second one, in this example it is on multiple places. But with other lines it is not. The brand is always presented after the ksg_Brand 
[13:50:55] <re101-shark-36> Exactly, only one example :)
[13:51:02] <rapha> ah, makes more sense now
[13:51:38] <re101-shark-36> Sorry for the confusion
[13:52:02] <rapha> can a brand name contain a dash?
[13:52:41] <rapha> (because if not, i'd just split this string at the dashes, not even using a regex)
[13:53:06] <re101-shark-36> No it does not
[13:53:36] <re101-shark-36> Ok, but I don't know how to do that in Google Data studio. I want to get the brand as a new field there
[13:53:54] <rapha> oh, whatever the heck that is

[18:12:26] <Me-me> Alright, let's take a look then.
[18:12:52] <Me-me> https://regex101.com/r/Q6HrHv/3 How's this one?
[18:13:06] <Me-me> https://regex101.com/r/Q6HrHv/4 Can even do it like this instead.
[18:13:47] <re101-uakari-52> Sweet, thank you so much! 
[18:14:05] <re101-uakari-52> What does it mean tho? :D  
[18:14:36] <Me-me> Well in /3 I put in "check if there's a letter before here, and if so, continue matching" and a "check if there's a letter after here" at the beginning and end, respectively.
[18:15:06] <Me-me> For /4 it actually matches those characters, instead of just "checking for" them. Faster, but a bit messier. If you're only using the capture group then it's fine.
[18:15:50] <Me-me> So /4 reads: "Match a letter, then a period, then any character other than a space, digit, or quotation mark, then match another letter."
[18:15:58] <Me-me> And it capture those inner two characters.
[18:16:06] <re101-uakari-52> Ahh thanks :D  Is there any way to make it so it's only three dots that's accepted with /4?
[18:16:43] <Me-me> What do you mean, three dots?
[18:16:59] <Me-me> You want to match the earlier instance instead?
[18:17:07] *** Quits: re (~re@user/re) (Quit: WeeChat 3.2)
[18:17:38] <re101-uakari-52> No, I want it to match on two dots or four dots for example :D  
[18:17:48] <re101-uakari-52> So it's only this...that is allowed 
[18:17:52] <re101-uakari-52> and..not this for example :D  
[18:18:07] <Me-me> https://regex101.com/r/Q6HrHv/5 Like this?
[18:18:40] <re101-uakari-52> Not exactly, it should still only match the "dette.er" :D  
[18:19:01] <re101-uakari-52> https://regex101.com/r/Q6HrHv/6
[18:19:02] <Me-me> I don't know what you're asking for, then. Is it three dots or one?
[18:19:28] <re101-uakari-52> It should match everything but three dots, does that make sense? :D  
[18:19:42] <re101-uakari-52> Like the example i just send, it should match "not..allowed"
[18:20:44] <Me-me> https://regex101.com/r/Q6HrHv/7 Like this?
[18:21:16] <Me-me> https://regex101.com/r/Q6HrHv/8 This will also match four or more periods.
[18:21:43] <re101-uakari-52> Exactly! Thank you so much man :D

[18:39:20] <digitok> 07rapha, to clarify, i simply meant to take your initial regex, being 07<name[^>]*>(.*)<\/name> and change 07.* to either 07[^<]* or 07.*?
[18:40:11] <digitok> meaning your regex would become either 07<name[^>]*>([^<]*)<\/name> or 07<name[^>]*>(.*?)<\/name> depending on whether there can be tags inside, because if so, 07[^<]* wouldn't work
