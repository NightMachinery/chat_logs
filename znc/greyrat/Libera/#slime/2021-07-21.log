[02:25:22] <incal> o/ I've been doing CL with SLIME and I wonder how it is suppose to be done with two files and one file refers to the other and uses stuff in that other file, in Elisp one would do `provide' ... `require' and byte-compile, here I found `load' but when I do `slime-eval-last-expression' on the `load' lines it says "file does not exist" (but it does, in the same dir) so either there is a path issue _or_ that's not the way to do it in CL,
[02:25:22] <incal> right? or am I wrong? TIA
[02:26:12] <Shinmera> you use a build system like ASDF.
[02:29:13] <incal> build system, like a Makefile? but I've heard of ASDF and it seems I have the Debian cl-asdf package installed? OK, so it is a build system written in CL and that's what one is suppose to use... clever
[02:30:20] <incal> Shinmera, you have an example?
[02:31:19] <incal> hm, in the example cairo-gl.lisp it is there, but what it loads isn't files in the same dir but parts (?) of the SDL and OpenGL libs what I can see
[02:31:58] <incal> (eval-when (:compile-toplevel :load-toplevel :execute) (asdf:load-system :sdl2) ...)
[02:36:45] <incal> (asdf:asdf-version) ; 3.3.4 - oki, seems operational
[02:43:52] <incal> OK, let's take it one step at a time, in the same dir I have a file triangle.lisp, as you see it contains just two functions <https://dataswamp.org/~incal/cl/general-base/triangle.lisp>
[02:44:42] <incal> so in the other file I do
[02:44:43] <incal> (require :asdf)
[02:44:47] <incal> (push "~/cl/general-base/" asdf:*central-registry*)
[02:44:52] <incal> (asdf:load-system :triangle) ; DNC
[02:44:57] <incal> "Component :TRIANGLE not found"
[02:45:24] <incal> do I have to make that file (triangle.lisp) into a "system" first?
[02:45:39] <incal> or maybe try to push the path w/o the tilde...
[02:51:29] <incal> doesn't work, is it really this complicated, define systems and so on, to get access to a file?
[02:58:08] <luis`> No, just (load "path/to/file.lisp") if that's what you want to do
[02:59:10] <incal> :) thanks
[02:59:38] <luis`> But at some point you'll want to figure out ASDF. No need to start there though 
[03:01:07] <incal> right
[03:05:20] <luis`> it's not too hard. From memory it's something like (defsystem triangle :components ((:file "triangle"))) in a file named triangle.asd 
[03:09:53] <incal> oki
[03:09:55] <incal> thanks
