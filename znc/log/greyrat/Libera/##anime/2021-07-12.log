[05:21:28] <ButterNoodle> furry shit is just one step away from bestiality
[05:22:33] <Roey> loli is closer to pedophilia than furry is to bestiality.
[05:22:35] <Roey> checkmate.
[05:22:44] <ButterNoodle> naa
[05:22:47] <ButterNoodle> thats incorrect
[05:22:53] <ButterNoodle> statistically speaking
[05:24:03] <Roey> bullshit, u just spewing out stuff that sounds mathy 
[05:24:12] <ButterNoodle> I mean you can google it
[05:24:18] <ButterNoodle> or have ImoutoBot google it for you
[05:24:41] <Roey> I mean, when you look at the # of standard deviations that deviants like loli lovers out-deviate the bestiality bros, it becomes clear.
[05:25:48] <ButterNoodle> burden of proof is on you.. might I suggest a few !g's?
[05:26:27] <Roey> only g-rated

[09:47:24] <Poeticode> Oh seems like it's a temporary Libera chat rule
[09:47:30] <amigojapan> Poeticode: is that the time you need between logins in libera?
[09:47:42] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[09:47:56] <Poeticode> I think so amigojapan but not positive
[09:48:03] <Poeticode> the notice: We're introducing a nickname expiration policy change to help free up some disused nicks a bit faster than usual. It's called the "two week two hour" rule and it will start being enforced at 12 noon UTC this Friday (25th); see more here https://git.io/JnDzg
[09:48:05] <ImoutoBot> [title] add 2 week 2 hour expiry rule to nickname policy · Libera-Chat/libera-chat.github.io@cf52115 · GitHub
[09:48:30] <ButterNoodle> the fuck
[09:48:32] <ButterNoodle> ?
[09:48:33] <amigojapan> I see Poeticode that is rather short. But I should be ok. I am here every day hahaha
[09:48:46] <ButterNoodle> so even if registered
[09:49:02] <ButterNoodle> if u dont log in in 2 weeks ur shit is done?
[09:49:25] <Poeticode> they really should have just used the language in that github link
[09:49:28] <Poeticode> "Nickname and account registrations expire ten weeks after they are last used. Nicknames belonging to accounts that are older than two weeks but were last used within two hours of registration are also considered to be expired."
[09:49:33] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: that is bs
[09:49:42] <ButterNoodle> yea
[09:50:15] <Poeticode> 10 weeks is still too short imo. That's like two days in IRC time
[09:50:19] <ButterNoodle> Poeticode: yea I dont think english is their native language
[09:50:26] <ButterNoodle> or the concept is lost on them
[09:51:31] <amigojapan> Alby_fox would have lost his nick
[09:51:45] <theholyduck> the 10 week thing makes sense to me. and the 2 week 2 hour rule is honestly fine

[09:52:24] <ImoutoBot> ButterNoodle: redphoenix was last seen in #anime 10 months and 5 days ago: <RedPhoenix> the benis is strong. thriving. i guess
[09:52:27] <amigojapan> I think a better policy would be to add an extra week to your expiration date every day you log in
[09:52:32] <ButterNoodle> !seen unicornjedi
[09:52:32] <ImoutoBot> ButterNoodle: unicornjedi was last seen in #anime 1 year and 7 months ago: <unicornjedi> y'all still here? damn son
[09:52:33] <theholyduck> ButterNoodle: it doesnt require you SAYING anything
[09:52:40] <ButterNoodle> yea
[09:52:49] <theholyduck> just literally connecting to the network
[09:52:54] <theholyduck> !seen warsh

[09:53:17] <theholyduck> despite not having said a word in 3 years
[09:53:49] <theholyduck> ButterNoodle: if you cant be bothered to like literally log in to your nickname once in 2 and a half months
[09:53:54] <theholyduck> not to say anything to anyone
[09:53:58] <theholyduck> then maybe irc isnt for you 
[09:54:12] <ButterNoodle> I have a lot of nicks
[09:54:17] <ButterNoodle> will someone log them in for me?
[09:54:30] <amigojapan> People like Toro have taken over nicknames of people that were here and their nicks expired
[09:54:40] <ButterNoodle> yep
[09:54:43] <theholyduck> ButterNoodle:  you squatting on a ton of nicks you dont use isnt very helfup
[09:54:49] <ButterNoodle> trolls like ur friend lode
[09:55:03] <ButterNoodle> yea they are all my nicks tho
[09:55:05] <theholyduck> ButterNoodle:  sure. but if they arent activly using them. then they will lose them
[09:55:09] <ButterNoodle> I've used them in the past
[09:55:33] <theholyduck> you dont have a "right" to own every varition of your username you can think of 
[09:55:41] <ButterNoodle> I mean you can argue it.. it doesnt help it to make sense
[09:55:55] <ButterNoodle> yea theholyduck, those arent the ones I have
[09:56:00] <theholyduck> what if somebody else wants to be lolipantsusniffer29
[09:56:11] <theholyduck> why do you need to keep hoarding that?

[10:01:15] <theholyduck> and everyone was totally able to abide by
[10:01:27] <theholyduck> the 2 week 2 hour rule is just for squatters

[22:08:54] <Bco1981> wait... windows 11 REQUIRES secure boot enabled in bios ?
[22:09:36] <Bco1981> sucks to be one of the dual booters
[22:10:51] <Matt|home> yay amazon gift card.. what should i buy.. 
[22:11:06] <Bco1981> a tpm 2.0 module
[22:11:17] <Bco1981> if you want windows 11.
[22:11:21] <Matt|home> i do need a new thong..
[22:11:30] <theholyduck> Bco1981: linux supports secure boot
[22:11:34] <theholyduck> and has since like forever
[22:11:40] <theholyduck> its pretty common in server applications 
[22:12:29] <Bco1981> ... so i guess secure boot only disables the abllity to boot of a usb then.
[22:12:39] <theholyduck> doesnt do that either
[22:13:30] <Bco1981> pretty sure i had to disable that on my new laptop before it would even see my usb stick in the boot options
[22:13:42] <theholyduck> sure. because the binary you were trying to launch presumably wasnt signed
[22:14:03] <theholyduck> thats not a limit on booting from usb
[22:14:07] <theholyduck> just WHAT you can boot from usb
[22:14:09] <Bco1981> but... that does not launch until i have selected the drive
[22:14:40] <theholyduck> Bco1981: you do realize to actually detect and boot the usb it needs to run some code right
[22:15:14] <theholyduck> Bco1981:  odds are the sticing point was how your usb drive is formated
[22:15:25] <Bco1981> so it's not like old times... here is a disk... i can read it...
[22:16:15] <theholyduck> for uefi/secure boot you need to format with GPD if memory serves
[22:16:19] <theholyduck> *gpt
[22:16:41] <theholyduck> i ran into this trying to install windows on some system with a random usb pen
[22:16:48] <Bco1981> yeah, i had to make 2 non uefi and uefi enabled windows 10 usb's
[22:16:58] <Bco1981> had to make two, *
[22:17:40] <theholyduck> Bco1981: but yeah theres no reason why you couldnt dual boot. or boot linux with secureboot stuff setup
[22:19:54] <theholyduck> Bco1981: anyways micorosft is making it mandatory to catch up with chromeos and osx
[22:20:03] <theholyduck> which allready has similar level of control over the boot process
[22:20:10] <theholyduck> as a security measure

[22:31:50] <prpldmn> wow
[22:32:02] <mathu> does anyone here have a way to contact bagelsan off of irc? he was looking for me on freenode earlier and is signed off now
[22:32:41] <brainwash> no clue who that is
[22:32:50] <mathu> he's been a user for ages lol
[22:33:06] <brainwash> then why did he not switch to the new place?
[22:33:12] <brainwash> we are all here
[22:33:24] <mathu> these days he pops in like once a month
[22:33:29] <mathu> probably missed the whole thing

[22:34:58] <snake> yeah
[22:35:16] <mathu> snake: why do you think you should say that to me when i'm asking people to let him know about this channel

[22:35:43] <snake> bagel was tolerable sometimes
[22:36:02] <snake> if i see his i will let him know, but i probably won't see him since i don't go to freenode or know him irl
[22:36:27] <mathu> i think some people use discord or whatever and may have a way to contact him that way
[22:36:36] <mathu> idk if he uses discord but like, i know some people do
[22:36:36] <snake> yeah possible
[22:36:40] <mathu> anyway i gotta go
