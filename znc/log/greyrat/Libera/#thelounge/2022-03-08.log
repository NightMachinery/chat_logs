[02:31:08] <bookworm> if you mean why not the release version, because it's hopelessly broken and pulls in a gazillion outdated deps including python2

[02:33:55] <bookworm> as for npm, I don't particularly care that it's broken, TL has a hard dep on yarn anyhow

[11:07:11] <newdimension> Hi, can someone tell me how I can get the certificate fingerprint so I can use SASL?
[11:08:31] <bookworm> newdimension: for libera?
[11:08:45] <bookworm> you don't need the fp for libera, just CERT ADD is enough
[11:09:00] <bookworm> (assuming you are identified and connected with sasl external
[11:09:02] <bookworm> )*
[11:09:46] <newdimension> bookworm: Usually I connect using a username and password. Then I got to network settings and choose SASL so TheLounge creates a certificate. I then need to get the fingerprint of that certificate it so I can add it 
[11:10:00] <bookworm> yes, where?
[11:10:03] <bookworm> which network?
[11:10:32] <newdimension> Any, isn't it the same process for all? /msgserv cert add ..
[11:10:38] <bookworm> no
[11:10:42] <bookworm> services differ
[11:10:58] <newdimension> I see, could you tell me for Libera and OFTC ?
[11:10:59] <bookworm> and as said, for this network we are on, you don't need the fingerprint, at all
[11:11:21] <newdimension> bookworm: Now I'm setup but when I was setting it up I did need to add the fingerprint
[11:11:55] <bookworm> well, yes, nickserv needs a cert fp, no you didn't had to manually specify it
[11:12:10] <newdimension> How would it know what certificate I want to use?
[11:12:18] <bookworm> nickserv on libera uses the cert fp of the thing you are connected with, unless you provide a different fp
[11:12:59] <bookworm> meaning as long as you've enabled sasl external on TL and manually identified with nickserv you can just do cert add with no arguments
[11:12:59] *** Joins: genera (~Genera@user/genera)
[11:13:04] <bookworm> but the UI is a bit clunky
[11:13:27] <bookworm> you can also /whois you, the fp is there as well on some networks

[11:16:13] <testing_sasl> This newdimension, going to test out what you recommend as we speak
[11:16:18] <bookworm> unless you are on a blacklist, you'd connect unauthenticated, then manually ID to nickserv and cert add

[11:20:50] <bookworm> you need to connect with sasl external when you want to do that

[11:22:46] <testing_sasl> What's the workaround then?
[11:22:49] <bookworm> in that case it is awkward
[11:24:14] <bookworm> in the $thelounge_home dir check in users/$account.json for network sections, mind the UUID. then head over to the certificated folder, find the file that matches that UUID and run `openssl x509 -in libera.pem -noout -fingerprint -sha512 | awk -F= '{gsub(":",""); print tolower ($2)}'` modifying the input libera.pem to whatever the filename is
[11:24:17] <bookworm> ^ something like that
[11:24:27] <bookworm> which is really not a good UX from our side sadly
[11:25:09] <bookworm> however, we anyhow need to fix some things with cert auth... TL is a bit too trigger happy at deleting them, _val just sent a PR that alleviates some of the problems there
[11:25:51] <bookworm> and then we need to have a bootstrap mode, where we auth with sasl plain but send the cert along

[11:38:59] <bookworm> thelounge9992: no
[11:39:10] <bookworm> or well, not a built in one
[11:39:45] <bookworm> do you use sqlite? If so you can query the db directly, or if you have text logs active you can find it on the server
