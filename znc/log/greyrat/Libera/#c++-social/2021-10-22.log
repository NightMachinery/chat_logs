[13:42:26] <Carbonflux> Rust
[13:43:16] <ManI> so much for rust being safer
[13:43:23] <ManI> if it were C++ he would have only shot himself int he foot
[13:43:37] <Faux> It's a safety feature, duh.
[13:51:13] <Carbonflux> i don't know what to make of it, he shot the cinematographer and the director.
[13:53:14] <Carbonflux> makes me wonder if Trump used dark magics to enact a grim revenge for Baldwin's many insults.
[13:55:37] <Carbonflux> his powers are both subtle and outrageous, a dichotomy indicative of ancient chaos.

[17:59:54] <Faux> Rust library. Absolutely performance critical code. Uses multiple hashmaps of strings, by value? Converts from indexed to string hashmap and back again. Such wankers.
