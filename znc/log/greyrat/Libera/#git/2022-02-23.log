[00:24:18] <slave_blocker2> if i do git clone https://github.com/SarangNoether/skunkworks/ i dont see anything. If i go, on the browser i can visit the individual branches. How do i do it on the cli?
[00:24:44] <slave_blocker2> i have done git fetch --all .
[00:25:37] <slave_blocker2> i can see all the branches with git branch -v -a .
[00:26:53] <rewt> you can `git checkout` a branch, like `git checkout master` (default), `git checkout cluster`, etc
[00:27:16] <nedbat> slave_blocker2: you said you don't see anything?  after "cd skunkworks", you should see the files on the default branch of the repo.
[00:28:04] <slave_blocker2> but if i do : git checkout -b name of branch it seems that it creates a new branch locally and nothing apears in the directory.
[00:28:07] <rewt> the master branch there only has a README, LICENSE, and .gitignore; all files are in the spearate branches
[00:28:26] <slave_blocker2> yes
[00:28:27] <rewt> slave_blocker2, i didn't say `-b`
[00:28:35] <slave_blocker2> oh
[00:29:30] <slave_blocker2> great thx

[13:15:56] <Walex2> bilbo: I think it depends on whether the tools *modify* files or *generate* them.
[13:16:27] <Walex2> bilbo: in general files that are generated from other files should not go into content management.
[13:17:16] <Walex2> bilbo: or perhaps you should have two branches, one for "original" files, and one for "original plus derived files" and merge periodically the former into the latter for building.#
[13:18:09] <bilbo> Walex2: right. what i'm trying now is to very tediously delete files, re-run autoconf and configure and then see if they get regenerated and then i git rm those files
[13:20:28] <Walex2> bilbo: you can more easily do that with a 'diff' etc., you get them all in one go.
[13:22:40] <Walex2> 'git status' after a build
[13:23:18] <bilbo> Walex2: yes, i am deleting the files that are maked as modified with git status
[13:23:49] <bilbo> Walex2: once i feel somewhat confident that they are being auto-generated. i guess i could delete all of them, run autoconf and configure, and if it complains i could git checkout those
[13:24:30] <anddam> Haohmaru: mm I see but I do not understand how <somerandomgui> that I do not know is going to help me over an actual git command

[15:58:23] *** Joins: ghost43 (~ghost43@gateway/tor-sasl/ghost43)
[15:58:51] <selckin> because you are rewriting history, and thats not nice on branches that are shared with other people
[15:58:55] <srinidhi> I asked this same question a few weeks back - but I couldn't get any answers or I couldn't understand properly.
[15:59:17] <srinidhi> selckin: like I mentioned, I'm the only one working on this branch.
[15:59:28] <srinidhi> and only from one system / git workarea
[16:00:03] <selckin> thats why its not a problem, some people prefer a nice clean history and commits that implement single features and work, other people prefer a clusterfuck or corss merges and fixup commits (guess which i like)
[16:00:08] <srinidhi> I'm not rebasing "onto master" - but I want to rebase my branch with master.
[16:01:19] <selckin> so feature branches, rebase on master, or change commits as you want, then merge into master, never rewrite history on master

[21:14:15] <GD-IRC> can you git log multiple paths?
[21:14:42] <GD-IRC> like `git log main src/c-writer.cc src/tools/wasm2c.cc ...` kinda stuff?
[21:14:44] <ikke> sure
[21:15:06] <ikke> GD-IRC: from man git log: "git log [<options>] [<revision-range>] [[--] <path>...]"
[21:15:06] <gitinfo> GD-IRC: the git-log manpage is available at https://gitirc.eu/git-log.html
[21:15:13] <ikke> note the ... after <path><
[21:15:17] <ikke> which means it can be repeated
[21:15:32] <GD-IRC> and this is the best way to maintain a fork?
[21:16:02] <ikke> What do you mean with maintaining a fork?
[21:16:04] <GD-IRC> or do you just merge the whole thing at once instead of each individual commit?
[21:16:29] <GD-IRC> ikke: https://github.com/SoniEx2/wasm2kotlin
[21:16:30] <ikke> in git, you typically merge history (entire branches), not individual commits
[21:16:53] <ikke> You can work with cherry-pick for example to only pick certain commits
[21:17:08] <ikke> but in the long run that would become harder and harder to maintain as the history would diverge more and more
[21:17:08] <GD-IRC> yeah but individual commits are bite-sized which makes it easier to keep track of merge progress
[21:18:08] <GD-IRC> so e.g. you can "git log main ..." and then "git merge --no-commit next-commit" then adapt the changes to the relevant files and then do it all over again with the new next commit
[21:18:24] <ikke> GD-IRC: maybe look into !imerge
[21:18:24] <gitinfo> GD-IRC: https://github.com/mhagger/git-imerge -- a tool to split a large merge with many conflicts into many smaller merges, hopefully each with easier-to-understand small conflicts.
[21:18:52] <GD-IRC> this doesn't have many conflicts
[21:19:01] <ikke> many conflicts are not required
[21:19:22] <GD-IRC> but yes this is basically what we want
[21:19:35] <ikke> but if there are conflicts, they are limited to changes from individual commits rather than all commits
[21:21:04] <GD-IRC> honestly tho, wasm2kotlin mostly tracks wasm2c, so we need to "replay" the commits that apply to wasm2c, on wasm2kotlin
[21:21:16] <GD-IRC> and it's easier to do that by doing each one individually instead of all at once
[21:21:37] <ikke> GD-IRC: possibly rebasing the commits then
[21:21:38] <GD-IRC> it's a manual process that can't really be automated with git merge, and imerge might not be able to automate it either
[21:22:05] <ikke> solving conflicts is not automatable by definition
[21:22:21] <ikke> but the process can be made easier with tools
[21:23:20] <GD-IRC> hmm, imerge rebase-with-history looks neat, but we don't want merge commits for each upstream commit
[21:24:20] <GD-IRC> "full" looks horrifying
