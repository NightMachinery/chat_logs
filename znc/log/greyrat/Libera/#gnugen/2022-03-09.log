[00:49:23] <Orbstheorem> <afontain[m]> "Roos: I know how you could use..." <- Haha...
[01:10:54] <Orbstheorem> I have a problem I can't seem to find a good solution for:
[01:10:57] <Orbstheorem> I am extremely dependent on my shell history. Oftentimes, I start by running a fuzzy-search and changing values and/or typing and interactive-completion.
[01:11:02] <Orbstheorem> I have a HISTSIZE of 100k. fzf is fast and async, but it's still a lot of IO and mem, delaying my shell's start-up time.
[01:11:05] <Orbstheorem> At the same time, I have many duplicates, or 'similar' command-lines that there's no point of storing multiple copies of (e.g. `git push origin HEAD:foo`, `git push origin HEAD:bar`). One would suffice, or even better, a 'default' value would be cool.
[01:11:08] <Orbstheorem> I thought about maintaining a separate file for "templates" and reducing my normal history size; but I don't want to be manually 'maintaining' a file. I like my shell 'automagically' storing important stuff.
[01:11:11] <Orbstheorem> So far it's not been an issue, but I find myself more and more frequently digging into my home directory backups to find an old copy of my HISTFILE that had that qemu, awk, strace, ffmpeg cmdline...

[10:28:32] <Orbstheorem> Honn√™tement, √ßa va...
[11:31:53] <sparrowhawk[m]> I hate google so bad
[11:33:49] <sparrowhawk[m]> I deploy an instance of Vaultwarden, everyrhing works fine for a few hours, and then users get the big red screen from hell that "oooh it's a phishing site so we've blocked it" and I can't do shit but fill in forms telling them it's bloody legit, owned by a company and that them blocking our whole fucking domain and not only that subd is fucking up our operations
[11:34:14] <sparrowhawk[m]> And I have no way of actual contact
[12:54:31] <Orbstheorem> Hmm... https://nuclear.js.org/
[12:56:35] <LucasCrijns[m]> The user testimonials are something else
[13:13:59] <afontain[m]> if there wasn't the github repo, this would look like a joke
[13:14:12] <afontain[m]> s/the/a/
[13:23:28] <Anyone[m]> I think it could work
[13:26:12] <afontain[m]> yeah, I mean the website is pretty and all
[13:26:26] <afontain[m]> it would look 100% legit if not for those comments
[13:27:18] <Anyone[m]> Yes, that's for sure üòÇ
[14:25:18] <Orbstheorem> Wtf those testimonials xD

[14:45:53] * Orbstheorem is very annoyed `¬ß` is not part of the standard `us-intl` keyboard layout...
[14:49:03] * Orbstheorem should start memorizing UTF-8 point codes...
[17:27:23] <LucasCrijns[m]> <Orbstheorem> "is very annoyed `¬ß` is not..." <- Alt Gr + Shift + S
[17:27:39] <LucasCrijns[m]> At least on US international with dead keys
[17:33:12] <LaurentRoro[t][m> https://laurent.sexy/soft/unicode-fanboy/
[17:33:27] <LaurentRoro[t][m> pour faire tous les symboles que tu veux
[17:52:38] <Orbstheorem> <LucasCrijns[m]> "Alt Gr + Shift + S" <- J'ai pas l'impression que c'est standard ...
[17:52:53] <Orbstheorem> √áa fonctionne sur firefox, mais pas sur mon terminal.
[17:53:36] <afontain[m]> C'est possible √ßa?
[17:54:53] <Orbstheorem> ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
[18:40:16] <Orbstheorem> <LaurentRoro[t][m> "https://laurent.sexy/soft/..." <- Omg, trop bien ! 
[18:40:30] <Orbstheorem> J'aurai aim√© trouver √ßa avant...
[20:09:30] <LaurentRoro[t][m> oui c'est pour √ßa que j'ai partag√©
[20:09:44] <LaurentRoro[t][m> parce que c'est tellement simple, mais y'a personne qui dit comment faire XD
[20:11:47] <Notkea> I want that but b√©po ;w;
[20:13:51] <LaurentRoro[t][m> you can modify the corresponding file (I think I sais where to find the original one)
[20:14:28] <LaurentRoro[t][m> usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/
[20:15:59] <Notkea> :D
[20:19:04] <afontain[m]> well, if someone were to make a nixos setup for it, you know, üòè
[22:46:06] <artectrex[m]> <Orbstheorem> "Hmm... https://nuclear.js.org/" <- Oh that's still going? Cool
