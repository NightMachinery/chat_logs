[08:35:27] <catern> hmmmm I guess tab-bar-mode is... good?
[08:35:59] <catern> it's possible to have multiple frames in a single terminal in terminal emacs, right?

[09:44:53] <howard-abrams> If you set the lang to `sh`, as in #+begin_src sh ... then it runs it with `sh`. If you set it to `shell`, then it runs that with whatever shell you have configured. I think others like `bash` and `fish` work too.
[09:45:09] <howard-abrams> Then you just hit `C-c C-c` to execute it.

[13:38:51] <pingpongball> Thank you
[13:39:20] <bkhl> This seems like the Doom package config needs to be updated to match the current version of the package?
[13:39:27] <wasamasa> it's at the end of the linked issue
[13:39:35] <pingpongball> I've already updated to latest and greatest version of doom
[13:39:42] <pingpongball> and i'm also on emacs 29.
[13:41:03] <bkhl> Seems to be a Doom question, how to either fix their package declarations to work with the new names, or pin the version to the older version of Flymake that's compatible with the current package config.
[13:41:49] <pingpongball> pin the version to the older version of Flymake that's compatible with the current package config
[13:41:50] <pingpongball> how?
[13:41:55] <wasamasa> there's a code snippet at the end
[13:41:58] <bkhl> That's the Doom question.
[13:41:59] <pingpongball> (package! flymake :pin "cf0eb2a47125be42973822e5f91b33d5681bfd4c")

[17:25:00] <wasamasa> > The original EMACS was written in 1976 by David A. Moon and Guy L. Steele Jr. as a set of Editor MACroS for the TECO editor.[2][3][4][5][11]

[17:26:06] <wasamasa> > Richard Stallman is often credited as another co-creator, but as Daniel Weinreb wrote, "The original (TECO-based) Emacs was created and designed by Guy L. Steele Jr. and David Moon. After they had it working, and it had become established as the standard text editor at the AI lab, Stallman took over its maintenance."
[17:26:18] <wasamasa> > Moon himself responded "All true, so far as I can remember. But in all fairness I have to say that Stallman greatly improved Emacs after he “liberated” it from Guy and me." See Weinreb, Dan (November 11, 2007), "Rebuttal to Stallman's Story About The Formation of Symbolics and LMI", Dan Weinreb's blog: software and innovation, archived from the original on January 1, 2009.

[17:27:56] <pingpongball> so why on eartch,  RMS at any speech that mentioning emacs, he giving fake speech, that he created emacs in 1976. .
[17:28:02] <pingpongball> =L
[17:28:30] <pingpongball> he didnt mentioned, i was coauthor or maintainer,
[17:28:33] <samlamamma> Eh, ego? He's not a perfect person.
[17:28:36] <wasamasa> I see a few reasons
[17:28:44] <wasamasa> 1976 is a long time ago
[17:28:49] * shapr gets out his cane
[17:28:51] <wasamasa> people like to make their stories smoother
[17:29:09] <wasamasa> and most importantly, RMS doesn't have any issue with twisting it if it helps with politics
[17:29:40] <pingpongball> ahhh  man :(    i liked rms, also had signed in support of emacs, but in most cases , i've seen his speech as fake , theifing from gosling. .....
[17:29:43] <empwilli> probably the best approach to handle this is to try to keep away from any person cult 
[17:29:53] <thblt> What empwilli says

[17:30:27] <pingpongball> i'll mail rms what he think of it
[17:30:28] <empwilli> does it really matter, though? I mean its injust in any case but emacs is more than the contributions of one person anyway and the emacs of 1976 is likely a different one than that of today
[17:30:28] <thblt> Or “came here to say this”, as they say on Reddit.
[17:30:58] <empwilli> just like linux is not all linus work but a collaboration of a large body of people 
[17:31:25] <wasamasa> likewise, RMS didn't have any issues with starting off gosling emacs or non-free software, because his goal was to create free software using that as stepping stone
[17:31:29] <artefact> linus didn't even choose the name. now he mostly just merges other people's code ;-)

[17:32:28] <thblt> pingpongball: yes, that's the origin story.  He started it, but as soon as he shared it he started receiving patches.
[17:32:41] <pingpongball> rms also credited guy steele but ... why such ego, i began to hate him ;(
[17:33:02] <empwilli> Its just: Open source software is most often than not a collaboration and more than the poster child person
[17:33:29] <empwilli> (eventhough these actors most often do still perform great in their respective communities)
[17:34:40] <empwilli> just do away with person cults, this is in most instances harmful, especially when those people start to act improper and their achievements are held up instead of addressing problematic behaviour  
[17:34:45] <Bayes> Is there a good way to manage many "mount connections" that's handy like .ssh/config? I can set up all things in one .ssh/config file and then simply do ssh shortname when I need to connect

[18:03:44] <empwilli> I would say that it holds for structure but not necessarily for elitism; still it requires a lot of willingness reflection and most likely lead to more friction in groups 
[18:04:49] <empwilli> IMHO it helps to frequently reflect what the common goals are, what means are necessary and how to sholder responsibilities (and IMHO this holds for every situation in live, even: "cleaning the coffee machine at the working place" situations)

[18:51:00] <ShinyRice> the excessive part I mean
[18:52:52] <TRS-80> I guess that's why I use weechat.  But I am thinking about switching, and so far played with ERC a bit.  Weechat is extensible, but I guess I would rather hack in ELisp than Python or anything else.

[23:22:49] <artefact> i hate fonts. why didn't we stick to bitmap fonts
[23:23:09] <twb> artefact: because india
[23:23:32] <artefact> my text legibility is not your playground (this is why i disable websites choosing their own fonts)
[23:23:33] <aidalgol> I thought it was because bitmap fonts don't scale nicely.  Literally.
[23:23:51] <twb> aidalgol: obviously that too but artefact can probably just say "I don't care if it looks ugly"
[23:24:02] <technomancy> hey, bitmap fonts do to scale nicely! as long as the scale factor is an integer.
[23:24:13] <twb> whereas "I don't care if a fifth of all humans can't use a computer" is more of a dickhead move

[23:25:27] <twb> optical sizing is fucked tho
[23:25:30] <artefact> obviously, unicode is a necessary evil. but rendering outline fonts on a coarse pixel grid, aouch, what a pain
[23:25:31] <twb> stroke fonts or GTFO
[23:25:51] <twb> artefact: so what I'm hearing is that you need a Tektronix display
[23:26:03] <artefact> or maybe just a really high dpi e-ink display
[23:26:40] <artefact> ...or a vectrex ;-)
[23:26:52] <acdw> god i want an e-ink display

[23:27:34] <artefact> i love my little ereader, the text is sharp and looks good. too bad the refresh rate sucks by design, and finding large(r) display is very hard
[23:27:38] <Catie> it's upsetting, there doesn't seem to be any interest whatsoever in proper e-ink displays

[23:28:50] <twb> I don't know if they really have stock
[23:28:53] <artefact> also, since e-ink doesn't really have a pixel grid, it has a kind of natural dithering effect that is very pleasing
