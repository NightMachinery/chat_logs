[00:04:05] <Telgareith> it doesn't help the last time I was really listened to I as politely as possible ended up throwing shit in everybodies face
[00:05:13] <Telgareith> what they wanted to do was a boondogle and would have 100% bankrupted the company
[00:05:25] <Telgareith> taken at least 2 years
[00:05:38] * JakeSays likes a good boondoggle

[00:07:52] <Telgareith> they didn't totally listen, because I also said to buy the PDF library too
[00:08:36] <Telgareith> because the piss poor way PDFs handle embedded fonts
[00:09:02] <JakeSays> might have been that shit-in-face bit

[01:37:02] <Lizard_> I do nolinger the socket so in sent it might be bypassing the buffering anyway to a point

[02:18:02] <wroathe> So powershell cmdlets require calls to WriteDebug and friends to be executed on the pipeline thread, and they throw an exception when called elsewhere. I'm being told one way to handle this from async library code would be to set up a blockingcollection to pass messages from the library code back to the pipeline thread, but it seems to me that Powershell is just generally designed to be used with
[02:18:08] <wroathe> single-threaded execution. Is there a way I can force a Task and it's sub-Tasks to all execute on the same thread?
[02:18:12] <wroathe> Specifically the pipeline thread?
[02:20:55] <viaSanctus> MatthiasVance, i'm sorry, but i'm tired and always end up with ugly algorithms which i'm 100% sure will fail with certain values

[02:23:45] <viaSanctus> to get my desired result?
[02:23:46] <MatthiasVance> Also yes that might be a good idea to improve speed

[02:24:30] <viaSanctus> this doesnt recognize the match
[02:25:09] <viaSanctus> thing is, the user sees an html component

[04:10:20] <BtbN> Or, you know, use DateTimeOffset
[04:10:36] <Suchiman> BtbN: well technically, DateTimeOffset doesn't handle timezones either, it just handles offsets which allow to reliably convert that date into Utc from whatever local representation it currently shows, it has no knowledge about a zone which might include things like DST,  e.g. if you do DateTimeOffset.Now and that reports an offset of +01 for me, and you do AddMonths(6) on it, that still reports an Offset of +01 even though it should be +2
[04:11:35] <BtbN> Yeah, if you throw in stuff like DST, it gets real messy
[04:11:49] <Suchiman> and if anything changes like DST transition rules, then that approach is also broken
[04:12:08] <Slade> BtbN, its not my api. asking me to rewrite microsofts apis is unreasonable
[04:12:23] <BtbN> Microsoft is switching over to DateTimeOffset wherever it can

[13:07:11] <eurogos> generic API question... I need to make an endpoint with a whole bunch of search/filter parameters (maybe 10-15). Should it be a POST with a search object in the request body or should it be a GET with 10-15 query string params?
[13:08:18] <eurogos> I feel it should probably be a GET with the query params but it looks ugly and I like the neatness of a single object in the request body...
[13:12:27] <jmer> eurogos: I think both approaches are valid, but the correct one is dependant on your needs
[13:12:35] <jmer> i.e. does a user need to be able to bookmark a specific search query?
[13:12:44] <canton7> There's also the option of putting a json object in the GET request -- I've seen that done as well
[13:13:42] <eurogos> jmer, I dont think so...
[13:14:24] <jmer> How long are the values of those 10-15 criteria?
[13:14:28] <jmer> potential values*
[13:14:40] <jmer> there's a limit of 2048 chars for an url
[13:14:54] <eurogos> way shorter than that

[13:22:57] <jmer> canton7: adding the json as part of the body of a get request?

[13:33:00] <MatthiasVance> The former
[13:36:31] <eurogos> do you think a GET should only just return one of something?
[13:36:48] <MatthiasVance> No, unless you specify which thing you want to get
[13:37:53] <eurogos> so in the users example I could have -> GET api/user/1 which returns the user with id 1
[13:38:06] <MatthiasVance> yes
[13:38:28] <eurogos> and if i wanted to return lots of users I would have -> POST api/user/search with a request body containing the filter/orderby params
[13:38:47] <eurogos> rather than api/users
[13:40:41] <MatthiasVance> /users should return all users (you have access to) I suppose
[13:41:26] <eurogos> i guess the issue is that returning lots of something is usually useless without filtering
[13:42:15] <jmer> eurogos: I think the search approach "breaks" REST
[13:42:37] <eurogos> ah man... ive talked myself round the full circle again

[13:44:01] <jmer> but having the "action"be part of the URL is more RPC-style
[13:44:30] <jmer> I guess you need to considder if ease of use is more important than REST adherance

[13:48:40] <jmer> eurogos: endless discussions have been made about this subject, I think there are valid reasons for both approaches.
[13:50:54] <jmer> eurogos: I found this, which seems to have some pretty valid points: https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/233164/how-do-searches-fit-into-a-restful-interface
[13:52:56] <MatthiasVance> Why does search need to be the same thing
[13:53:12] <MatthiasVance> Why do you want to apply one solution to *everything*?
[13:53:22] <jmer> MatthiasVance: I am not following
[13:53:59] <biberu> eurogos: hm, regardless of how you're transmitting the search parameters they should be mapped to some object that describes the query in your domain, if the source is url params or request body should be ~ 1 loc to change
[13:55:20] <biberu> eurogos: sounds suspect that it should be so much work, but perhaps you meant something else?
[13:56:33] <eurogos> I've got the opportunity to "standardise" the endpoints across the whole application, so I want to pick one strategy and make sure its applied in the same way
[13:57:45] <jmer> eurogos: After seeing how this evolved I think I need to take back that I would use POST xD
[13:58:03] <jmer> I simply had not considdered REST adherence
[13:58:04] <jmer> sorry
[13:58:14] <eurogos> godd, i've just about convinced myself it needs to be GET
[13:58:37] <eurogos> with the query string params
[13:58:40] <jmer> Then you are following REST - which I think is important if your company hasstated that webservices use REST at least xD
[13:59:00] <eurogos> (contained in single object so theres just one place to change them)
[13:59:18] <biberu> (would also start with GET until there's a reason to do it differently)
[13:59:31] <eurogos> ok!
[13:59:56] <biberu> e.g. if the query can be too large for the url
[14:00:19] <eurogos> last question... should I pluralize the endpoint name?
[14:00:34] <eurogos> i.e. GET api/user or GET api/users
[14:00:45] <eurogos> or use both
[14:01:03] <MatthiasVance> Nasp, JakeSays : Never mind :o It's printing perfectly now after: Tweaking the z-offset a tiny tiny tiny bit more (0.04?) and lowering the temperature of the bed to 50C and setting retraction to 6mm at 25mm/s
[14:01:29] <MatthiasVance> Initial layer speed at 20mm/s instead of 25mm/s
[14:01:42] <eurogos> both. decided
[14:01:43] <MatthiasVance> Still ordered glue sticks though :D
[14:01:55] <MatthiasVance> eurogos: No!
[14:01:57] <MatthiasVance> Pluralize
[14:02:07] <MatthiasVance> Having 2 ways of doing something is shitty
[14:02:14] <biberu> eurogos: both? that's not going to be fun to maintain
[14:02:18] <biberu> for anyone
[14:02:34] <jmer> eurogos: I don't think you should change pluralization when accessing a specific user
[14:02:40] <eurogos> so when I want to just return one user I should have GET api/users/1
[14:02:51] <jmer> eurogos: if the endpoint that returns everything is /users then a specific user should be /users/1
[14:03:11] <biberu> example: what if your users mix versions? how is one of their developers supposed to know that those urls do the same thing at a glance?
[14:04:02] <jmer> Imagine the logic needed if you want to build a string that queries for soemthing specific instead of everything? suddenly you need to generically pluralize whatever term or retain (and maintain) lots of boilerplate code which only responsibliity is figuring out pluralization
[14:04:17] <biberu> eurogos: api/user/1, api/users/search?params?
[14:04:17] <eurogos> great point
[14:04:31] <eurogos> aahhh
[14:05:10] <biberu> whatever you choose i wouldn't map several patterns to the same function
[14:05:30] <jmer> whatever you choose, stick with it... xD
[14:05:42] <eurogos> hahaha
[14:05:57] <jmer> either everything is pluralized or everything is singular... xD

[14:08:10] <jmer> biberu: I've mostly seen it with table names...
[14:08:38] <jmer> biberu: Some idiot thought it a good idea to pluralize table names "because they contain more than one" and suddenly you're stuck trying to figure out if it's person vs persons or person vs people
[14:08:57] <biberu> yeah, that's annoying for a database
[14:09:46] <jmer> my point is, if he has /users that returns a list of users, the url that returns ONE user is /users/<ID of user>

[14:10:48] <jmer> MatthiasVance: as long as your Customer class is called Customers even though it only represents one I'm fine with it xD
[14:10:55] <jmer> because then it won't be a PITA to fix when mapping
[14:10:59] <MatthiasVance> No
[14:11:00] <jmer> ... it'll look odd though
[14:11:03] <MatthiasVance> And you don't need to fix mapping
[14:11:11] <MatthiasVance> Customers contains multiple Customer
[14:11:13] <MatthiasVance> *of

[14:11:31] <jmer> I've never seen EF used correctly xD

"Relation" and it can either be related to a Nurse or Technician via this single relationship instead of having two
[16:43:44] <tsujp> relations "RelationNurse" and "RelationTechnitition" and allowing both to be nullable because that gets out of hand as this scales up, more columns, more relations etc etc

[18:17:47] <sysRPL> typically when a 3d printer is connected to a pc, it is seen as an emulated serial port
[18:17:51] <irwiss> MatthiasVance: use a powered usb hub?
[18:17:58] <tsujp> Like, are you telling me this 3D printer essentially breaks (stops to function, "it doesn't like XYZ") when a USB cable is plugged in? Sounds like a shitty printer
[18:18:13] <MatthiasVance> irwiss: What?
[18:18:14] <tsujp> If so, just cut the 5v wire in the USB cable you use for that printer
[18:18:22] <tsujp> and/or complain to the manufacturer to make a better product
[18:18:30] <MatthiasVance> irwiss: I want 0 power, not more power :D
[18:18:43] <irwiss> MatthiasVance: there's usb hubs that supply their own power, so it won't draw amps from printer's usb
[18:19:04] <sysRPL> and then apps use the USB connectiona s a serial port to control and or exchange data with the computer <-> 3d printer
[18:19:09] <MatthiasVance> Oh no it's the other way around irwiss
[18:19:30] <irwiss> ah wtf...
[18:19:55] <MatthiasVance> Yes indeed :P
[18:20:13] <MatthiasVance> So apparently the charger that I never use already is 5V/3A .. I just need a USB-C cable ..
[18:20:25] <sysRPL> this `ben eater` fellow has a few video teardowns of how usb works
[18:20:58] <sysRPL> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0O5Uwc3C0o
[18:21:08] <bomb> MatthiasVance you need this https://i.imgur.com/r07OvHh.png
[18:21:37] <tsujp> Am I missing something? 5 minute job: strip usb cable, cut 5v, close with shrinkwrap, done
[18:21:52] <tsujp> heatshrink*
[18:22:00] <MatthiasVance> tsujp: I don't have a heatshrink thing :D
[18:22:06] <MatthiasVance> Otherwise I would have done it
[18:22:08] <tsujp> electrical tape?
[18:22:10] <tsujp> duct tape?
[18:22:20] <MatthiasVance> Might as well put a little on the connector then? xD
[18:22:33] <jmer> duct tape conducts electricity
[18:22:38] <jmer> don't use it for isolatoin xD
[18:22:40] <MatthiasVance> Bzzzt
[18:22:56] <tsujp> Or just use nothing while you wait for your heatshrink to arrive
[18:23:04] <MatthiasVance> I knew it
[18:23:07] <tsujp> It's not like it's a mains power line to a lamp or someting
[18:23:21] <MatthiasVance> Ordering a 3D printer opened me up to all kinds of new tooling that I suddenly "need"
[18:23:30] <sysRPL> btw, how is it that more expensive places restaurants near me me are doing great business while all the diners and similars other places are near death?
[18:23:34] <tsujp> 5v over some puny gauge wire = basically no significant current over it
[18:23:50] <sysRPL> the denny's and ihops around me are all closing down
[18:23:54] <jmer> sysRPL: in my experience if you ain't paying a premium price, the food will be crap
[18:24:19] <tsujp> I sell prawn crackers for $100, anyone want some? They are great trust
[18:24:55] <jmer> isn't prawn crackers those types of chips that are more air than anything else? xD
[18:25:08] <tsujp> Sure are
[18:25:10] <sysRPL> yesterday i wanted to get some pancakes at 4pm at two different denny's restaurants and they were both closed due to staffing issues
[18:25:17] <tsujp> They are the pink ones that come with chinese food typically
[18:25:29] <sysRPL> and the ihop had TERRIBLE service
[18:25:46] <sysRPL> the oen waitress never checked on us
[18:25:52] <sysRPL> * one
[18:26:07] <sysRPL> she had her face burried in her smart phone most of the time
[18:26:16] <sysRPL> buried even
[18:26:50] <sysRPL> i went to my local mall for the first time in 15 years yesterday as well
[18:27:09] <sysRPL> in one wing 9/10 stores were closed
[18:27:18] <biberu> 15 years? i've totally lost sense of how long this pandemic has been going on
[18:27:47] <sysRPL> i wanted to go to this mall and walk around to check it out before it was permanently closed
[18:28:32] <sysRPL> biberu: i think mall closures has more to do with online shopping versus covid
[18:29:49] <sysRPL> there is even a subreddit r/deadmalls for this stuff
[18:30:05] <MatthiasVance> Staffing issues due to not paying enough most likely sysRPL ?
[18:30:23] <jmer> hmmm..
[18:30:44] <jmer> we prepaid our gas bill for 712 m3 of gas... and I can see that since we moved in (November 1. last year) we've used 647 m3
[18:30:54] <MatthiasVance> Uh oh?
[18:31:00] <jmer> ... this prepaid bill is supposed to last until march
[18:31:32] <sysRPL> MatthiasVance: i believe all restaurants here use the same pay rate for service people ... pay rate = mostly tips
[18:31:48] <jmer> I never understood how people are willing to work only for tips
[18:31:51] <biberu> ^
[18:31:58] <jmer> If the food is shitty, the waiter/waitress will get no money
[18:32:12] <jmer> no matter how sweet he/she was
[18:32:16] <biberu> if the waitress isn't getting a fair salary, why should i encourage this?
[18:32:39] <sysRPL> yeah well, it's been like that for more than 100 years
[18:33:11] <sysRPL> it's only now that people are unwilling to do that
[18:33:29] <tsujp> If I have a backing-field on an EF entity can I configure logic such that column A and column B only one can be null, so A can be null if B is not, B can be null if A is not
[18:33:46] <sysRPL> it's either that people are tipping less, people are going out to cheap places less, or the wait staff has given up
[18:33:53] <tsujp> I'm in a pickle wrt to a multiple path cascade so I need to be able to do this if possible

[21:53:56] <jonp> though maybe i could make that work…
[21:54:03] <Xenoprimate_Surf> Hmmm. You COULD assign one of your properties via a dummy method invocation that does what you want
[21:54:13] <Xenoprimate_Surf> Like public int V { init; get; } = SomeMethod();
[21:54:18] <Xenoprimate_Surf> Not sure if that will work
[21:54:23] <Xenoprimate_Surf> But why wouldn't it
[21:54:41] <biberu> jonp: alternatively, static factory function?
[21:55:01] * biberu doesn't like constructors that do stuff anyway
[21:55:06] <Xenoprimate_Surf> Same actually
[21:55:16] <Xenoprimate_Surf> If I was writing my own lang I'd do away with ctors entirely
[21:55:26] <biberu> it should only initialize
[21:55:27] <Xenoprimate_Surf> They're just weird special freaky static factory funcs

[21:57:37] <Xenoprimate_Surf> Also, seeing as Reddit hasn't given me an answer here thus far, maybe you smart people might have an answer: https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/s6z89v/is_there_a_way_to_avoid_redeclaring_the_variable/
[22:00:07] <biberu> Xenoprimate_Surf, jonp: sometimes I'll even make my constructors private and only expose a factory function, typically if it might fail or needs to allocate some resource

[22:00:32] <Xenoprimate_Surf> Yeah. I'd love a language that didn't allow public ctors at atll
[22:00:34] <Xenoprimate_Surf> *all
[22:01:10] <Xenoprimate_Surf> It would remove that nasty transition stage in library APIs where you had something that had a public ctor but its complexity grows and now you have to switch to a static ctor
[22:11:23] <Nasp> Oldschool mvc suuucks
[22:11:36] <Nasp> you can't debugt startup code due to the debugger being to slow to attach and sometimes attaches after startup is done
[22:21:04] <DevJohnC> jonp, I guess in idiomatic C# the record is intended to be a bag of properties and any non-trivial work that needs doing should be in a service class, and if it's just a derived property you need you'd write it as a get property and cache the value if it's expensive to compute

[22:42:09] <MatthiasVance> Frustrating :D
[22:42:36] <MatthiasVance> Seeing jonp's GitHub page reminded me of that, perhaps I should check other TLDs

[22:53:51] <lz_> are there dns offline databases so that we can quickly find available domains
[22:56:45] <lz_> It took a couple of weeks for this access to be granted. After your form is approved, you will receive FTP credentials that can be used to download the zone files daily.
[22:56:48] <lz_> lol what
[22:56:51] <jonp> why would you need an offline DNS db?
[22:57:19] <lz_> why not
[22:57:43] <lz_> "This was about 10TB of metadata and resulted in 26 million domain names"
[22:57:46] <lz_> 10 tb holy shit
[22:58:26] <ki9a> but dns is not meant to be enumeratd?
[22:58:43] <ki9a> A server isn't even required to return a list of subdomains
[22:58:49] <lz_> I just want the domains
[22:58:53] <ki9a> oke
[22:59:22] <lz_> found an archive on hackernews... from 2015
[22:59:26] <MatthiasVance> lz_: instantdomainsearch.com
[23:00:06] <lz_> MatthiasVance: also the last thing I'd want is to type a domain I want before registering it
[23:00:14] <MatthiasVance> xD
[23:00:37] <lz_> https://zonefiles.io/ looks nice

[23:18:58] <lz_> for some reason I keep changing subjects
[23:19:41] <lz_> I may be missing neurons
[23:20:00] <MatthiasVance> Or focus? Does the project interest / motivate you enough?
[23:20:05] <MatthiasVance> Or the goal

[23:33:51] <ki9a> do kids always snore?
[23:34:02] <jonp> no
[23:34:10] <ki9a> my daughter seems to make more noise than I do
[23:34:22] <jonp> might need to have her nose looked at
[23:34:29] <jonp> could be a deviated septum
[23:35:07] <brianonymous> yeah, seems unusual. is it a recent thing or just something she always has done
[23:35:13] <ki9a> always really
[23:35:15] <ki9a> she's 2
[23:35:29] <jonp> i'd suggest asking your pediatrician
[23:36:08] <ki9a> i will at the next visit
[23:36:23] <ki9a> i think she'll get an invitation when she's 3 anyway
[23:46:30] <MatthiasVance> Either more rum or less rum
[23:46:45] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: ROFL!
[23:50:38] <ki9a> Oh rum
