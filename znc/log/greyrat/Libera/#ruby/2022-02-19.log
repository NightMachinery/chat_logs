[00:38:55] <adam12> axsuul: "Heroku" might be a good keyword here, since they IMHO pioneered the technique.
[00:39:16] <havenwood> axsuul: Or you could create your own. Lots of unix OSes have a "words" file too.
[00:39:36] <havenwood> WORDS = File.readlines('/usr/share/dict/words', chomp: true).filter { _1.match?(/\A\w{3,}\z/) }.map(&:downcase).freeze
[00:39:39] <havenwood> WORDS.sample(3).join('-')
[00:40:19] <liqu1d> Dooky, If you select the create your own approach, probabbly you can use the faker gem as a source of words

[00:41:16] <havenwood> adam12: good caveat for sure

[01:58:59] <mooff> what are some good patterns for having hooks that are defined at a class level, and shared by subclasses, which can have their own additions?
[02:00:45] <mooff> should i simply write a method that walks up ancestors, checks if the ancestor includes the hook module, and if so, concat its hooks?
[02:01:26] <mooff> or are there any tastier, easier ways to do it

[04:51:45] <mooff> an IRC bot library, composed of small modules
[04:52:51] <ox1eef> generally i would say it is not a good idea, storing things on the class is much like using globals
[04:53:53] <mooff> in which regards?
[04:56:07] <ox1eef> classes are usually referenced by constants that are accessible from everywhere in your program, including different threads. my rule of thumb is to keep as much as possible local to a given thread.
[05:10:20] <mooff> race safety, that's a reasonable point
[05:12:52] <ox1eef> i like how JS handles this, where other ES6 modules are references in the local scope.
[05:18:57] <mooff> don't ES6 imports give the same object, when used in different files, like CommonJS?
[05:24:40] <ox1eef> i don't think so, at least 'import foo from "foo.js"' followed by foo.bar = 1, keeps that change local to its scope. if you wanted your changes to hang around, probably you want to add them to 'window' or another global object.
[05:28:58] <mooff> cool
[05:29:30] <mooff> here's basically what i've got, to concretize: https://dpaste.org/WmE1
[05:30:52] <ox1eef> it looks good, but id just repeat what i said before - do you really need class methods? couldn't the hooks be on the bot instance itself?
[05:32:57] <mooff> the hooks are, but the configure actions are there to add the hooks onto instances
[05:33:34] <mooff> classes fit nicely in their role as templates, i think

[05:35:05] <ox1eef> they're shared state by all bot instances though, and i think not neccessary. it seems that too could belong to the Bot instance.
[05:35:37] <mooff> i'm using it to run many bots in a process, and they're made / modified a lot at runtime
[05:36:21] *** Joins: gr33n7007h (~gr33n7007@user/gr33n7007h)
[05:36:46] <mooff> it would be onerous to have to add behavior 'by hand' after an instance is constructed
[05:37:45] <mooff> especially when a lot.. for example, the PONG reply given by Bot::Pong.. is common to most instances
[05:38:24] <ox1eef> if you want to have multiple bots per process then it sounds like having each isolated to one thread with no shared state would be ideal. i dont fully understand what youre trying to do in terms of sharing behavior tho.
[05:43:33] <mooff> atm they do run! in separate threads, but their behavior is composed at a class level
[05:45:21] <mooff> i did want instances to be flexible. the on instance method is the thing that ultimately binds actions
[05:48:03] <mooff> how do you feel about ActiveModel, ActionController etc?
[05:50:30] <ox1eef> rails is the model thats proven itself most successful in ruby, and i think that speaks to itself. having said that, the rails model isnt the only model and at times it feels like one guys opinion.
[05:51:14] <mooff> you might appreciate this. gave me a chuckle last night https://boyter.org/static/books/Cfh9oRrXIAAiA2Y.jpg
