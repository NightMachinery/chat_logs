[11:43:30] <obviyus> can i specify a name for the file i send in a POST request (using clj.http)?
[11:44:15] <obviyus> e.g. `:multipart        [{:name "file" :content (clojure.java.io/file tempfile)}]` sends the file with a randomly generated filename; i'd like to specify one
[11:54:59] <wink> obviyus: I have no special advice here, but that's pretty common, also in other languages/frameworks. it is after all uploaded to a temporary file and you're supposed to move it to the (sanitized/allowed) original filename
[11:55:41] <wink> in my opinion it's a bit of an antipattern if the upload just writes it to the same name without means of intervention
[11:56:07] <wink> you should somehow get the original filename though
[11:56:32] <obviyus> i do, essentially what i'm doing here is receiving a file in a POST multipart
[11:56:41] <obviyus> and then forwarding it to another POST request 
[11:57:19] <obviyus> ```{:keys [content-type filename tempfile]} (get-in req [:multipart-params "file"]``` gets me the file and filename 
[11:58:34] <wink> oh, then I slightly misunderstood, sorry
[11:59:14] <obviyus> no worries, what you said makes sense as well

[22:43:53] <Vaelatern> Someone on the slack found it! https://github.com/oakes/odoyle-rules
[23:21:45] <EdwardIII> Vaelatern: it's interesting. are you looking to use it for something? making a nethack clone? :)
[23:24:31] <ridcully> i fooled around with clara a while ago and i'd totally like to build some board game or something with something like this
[23:24:42] <ridcully> gonna read the docs from o'doyle then
[23:34:12] <Vaelatern> EdwardIII: Not interested in the game bit at all, actually
[23:34:30] <Vaelatern> but was fascinated by the idea for state management in larger applications
[23:34:43] <Vaelatern> as well as making larger applications more testable
[23:35:47] <sobel> i have barely ever gone wrong with state machines
[23:36:14] <sobel> they're extremely easy to make in clojure
[23:37:37] <Vaelatern> the trick is the side effects
[23:37:58] <sobel> do you mean transition handlers?
[23:38:14] <sobel> or enter/exit triggers
[23:38:53] <sobel> state machines work so well i like to stick with the paradigm if i can
[23:39:34] <Vaelatern> nodes with side effects
[23:40:04] <sobel> that is not a well defined term for me
[23:40:59] <Vaelatern> see edges can't have side effects since side effects can fail
[23:41:11] <Vaelatern> that's where the complicated logic creeps in
[23:41:21] <sobel> it seems like you are talking about nouns like they're verbs
[23:41:39] <Vaelatern> I'm verbing, I do that often
[23:41:55] <sobel> i don't think that's the same thing
[23:42:48] <Vaelatern> verbs are just different on the syntax tree. But the core is this: Say you read from a remote endpoint. Take an action based on a successful read, or take a correction action based on an unsuccsessful read
[23:43:07] <Vaelatern> you could bundle that up in an edge of a FSM and return [success data]
[23:43:20] <Vaelatern> or do a node with 2 edges out
[23:43:49] <sobel> teh hwat
