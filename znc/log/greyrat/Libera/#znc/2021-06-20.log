[02:15:02] <mark> hi, is it possible to make znc retain channel history? i thought that enabling the clientbuffer module would do this but it doesn't seem to work. eg if i connect on device A, type "hello" in a channel, then connect on device B (both through znc) device B doesn't see any channel history
[02:17:00] *** Joins: Noisytoot (noisytoot@sourcehut/user/noisytoot)
[02:25:54] <MetaNova> mark: the key to that is persistent buffers

[02:26:28] <MetaNova> see https://wiki.znc.in/Multiple_clients#Full_overview step 2
[02:28:18] <MetaNova> also, make note that if you're only testing based on what _you_ say (such as joining a new channel to test) that may expectedly fail if you're testing with clients which don't support self-message

[09:22:16] <luisereb1i> Is it best to run znc with SSL? I noticed that it seems to be specified in the docs that it is best when there are multiple people using znc?
[09:22:48] <luisereb1i> from the docs: `Signed SSL certificates are recommended when more than one person uses the ZNC instance`
[09:23:23] <SniperFodder> I think you should SSL period.
[09:23:35] <SniperFodder> should use*
[09:24:01] <SniperFodder> I'm the only user on my bouncer, but I still have it reverse proxied behind a server that uses SSL.
[09:25:25] <luisereb1i> I see... I might be having a bit of an XY problem, actually
[09:26:26] <SniperFodder> Link to the doc in question?
[09:26:52] <germ> don't the ports work for both http & IRC ? (You do have to select SSL appropriately in either case though)
[09:27:25] <germ> I.e. if you set it, then use it: tick the option in the client or be sure to put https in the browser
[09:28:10] <SniperFodder> well for http, I don't think ZNC generates it's own certs, but it's been a long time since I did setup last. Plus the communications between apache and ZNC are not SSL encrypted.
[09:29:00] <SniperFodder> I let apache essentially wrap the http traffic and manage the TLS certificate. For connecting to IRC I always try and connect to the SSL port provided by the network if there is one.
[09:29:37] <luisereb1i> I'm trying to connect to znc with irssi, but whenever I try to run `/server <znc_server_ip> +6698 <user>/<password>`, I get, `Irssi: Unknown command: server 139.162.88.23`. So I then try `/server <znc_server_ip> +6698 <user>/<password>`, but I then get `Irssi: warning Connection reset by peer`
[09:29:54] <luisereb1i> ...oh, looking back at the docs, it seems it's suggested that there's an `-SSL` switch.
[09:30:06] <luisereb1i> I get more output adding it now, though I had to add connect
[09:30:11] *** Joins: Dark_Demon (~Dark_Demo@d50-99-166-133.abhsia.telus.net)
[09:30:13] <germ> yeah the certs are self-signed. So there is that too: you gotta say yes and trust =D
[09:30:48] <germ> ya reset by peer when you connect clear while it's set on SSL on znc, that is what I get too I think
[09:30:55] <SniperFodder> ah, now that I think about it, I specify the TLS Cert apache pulls down for ZNC, so it uses the one generated by Let's Encrypt.
[09:31:05] <luisereb1i> (ahhh, I botched the message above, what I mean to say is that, I tried `/server connect <znc_server_ip> +6698 <user>/<password>` and then got `Irssi: warning Connection reset by peer`
[09:31:09] <germ> ah you
[09:31:28] <germ> 're fancy SniperFodder: ;P
[09:31:49] <SniperFodder> I totally forgot there is a connection between IRC CLient and ZNC. I was so focused on ZNC to IRC server lol
[09:32:41] <luisereb1i> Thank you germ, SniperFodder, for the help so far!
[09:33:37] <luisereb1i> At this point, I'm getting more output... though also an "Invalid Password" followed by "Irssi: Connection lost to <server_ip>"
[09:34:10] <SniperFodder> I don't know how comprehensive IRSSI's logging is, but you can also test TLS with openssl
[09:34:37] <SniperFodder> I checked my ZNC Start job, and I don't have any other flags specified so I think I have some config files setup somewhere. Le tme do some more digging.
[09:34:54] <luisereb1i> I'm not entirely sure how I might diagnose the password issue, though I suspect maybe it's either syntax I'm entering into irssi is off, or it's that the password really is off somehow (i don't need to set it, right, i set it during the whole --makeconf...)
[09:36:06] <germ> Ah ! so the password may go along with the login name, in the password :|
[09:36:29] <germ> ie: login: whicheveritdoesntmatter password:actuallogin:password
[09:36:33] <SniperFodder> I use something like this in mIRC. /joinlibera /s -m znc.silicateillusion.org +6697 <username>/LiberaChat:<zncpassword>
[09:37:26] <SniperFodder> Do you login go the http console at all?
[09:37:53] <SniperFodder> Generally speaking if you use that account for the web console, that password is what you'll also connect to ZNC with.
[09:39:59] <luisereb1i> Yup, I succesfully managed to login to the https console! using the same user/password combination
[09:41:28] <SniperFodder> according to the documentation, the connection string for credentials should look like "zncuser/zncnetwork:password"
[09:41:47] <luisereb1i> hmmmm... i may have to toy a litle with this...
[09:41:50] <luisereb1i> ahhhh, success!
[09:42:20] <luisereb1i> `/server connect -SSL <ip_address> <port> <user>/liberachat:<password>` seems to have done the trick!!

[09:54:27] <luiserebii> [#znc] do you feel uncomfortable typing that password in when connecting to znc from an IRC client? It's kind of minor, but after hitting the Enter key, on irssi, I can hit one
[09:55:10] <luiserebii> s/I can hit one/I can hit the up arrow a few times to obtain the password I used in the command into the buffer
[09:55:11] <ZNC-Linker> luiserebii meant: “[#znc] do you feel uncomfortable typing that password in when connecting to znc from an IRC client? It's kind of minor, but after hitting the Enter key, on irssi, I can hit the up arrow a few times to obtain the password I used in the command into the buffer”
[09:55:40] <SniperFodder> IRSSI is local to your computer yeah?
[09:56:23] <SniperFodder> As long as you don't re-use the ZNC password for anything else, should be fine.
[09:56:32] <germ> the pass is stored clear to me.. I suppose at least I should make it random
[09:57:17] <SniperFodder> The other concern is if your computer is multi-user. In that case as long as you lock your computer should be fine.
[09:58:54] <luiserebii> Yup, it's local to my computer... alright, I guess I won't worry further. (though, I might change the password to someting I don't reuse in that case, haha)
[09:59:20] <SniperFodder> Yeah, you shouldn't re-use passwords at all if you can. Use a password manager like bitwarden or keepass
[10:03:55] <SniperFodder> I don't know about IRSSI, but at least in mIRC I have all the networks I connect to stored as aliases. At least keeps them clear of the history. https://i.imgur.com/EzcV9bz.png
[10:06:10] <luiserebii> I really should use a password manager...
[10:07:02] <luiserebii> Ahhh, yes, it is possible to add a server and assign an alias to it! That should be my next thing to do.
[10:07:40] <SniperFodder> Yeah, I know... maybe half a dozen passwords? 1 for my password manager, and some for accounts I don't keep in it. Everything else is a randomized alphanumeric password that I have no idea what it is.
[10:08:13] <luiserebii> I was really excited to use the `detach` feature of znc, however, it is maybe not entirely working as I expected. Is there some setting I have to modify to load the recent messages in a channel that have been shown, while I was detached from the channel from the client, but still connected?
[10:08:28] <SniperFodder> buffer I think.
[10:09:28] <luiserebii> Do you ever feel anxious having a number of passwords in your password manager? I guess I keep thinking... if I lose the password manager, I'm suddenly locked out from many of my accounts. I think my concerns might be more naive than not
[10:10:13] <SniperFodder> Not really. 99% of the accounts are tied to my email account, so if worse comes to worst, I can just recover the account using email account recovery.
[10:11:35] <luiserebii> Hmmm, maybe I should sit down and think about having a password manager more seriously. Is your password manager on your phone? Or do you have a specialized device?
[10:11:52] <luiserebii> (also, thanks, looking through ZNC docs for buffer feature)
[10:12:23] <luiserebii> (ahhh, playback buffers, yes, this is what I need)
[10:13:03] <SniperFodder> I use bitwarden. It has a client for my phone, as well as browser plugins. I actually pay the 12$ or whatever a year for the extra features because I appreciate what goes into the project, and I like supporting it.

[22:16:49] <Nighthawk> Hi i just installed latest znc, and it is up and running, but in some odd reason i can't connect to it and i also can't find logs. I'm using ubuntu 18 with OpenSSL
[22:16:52] <Nighthawk> any ideas?
[22:22:56] <bookworm> how did you start it Nighthawk ?
[22:23:36] <Nighthawk> after i already used znc --makepem and znc --makeconf and after i killed the process and i want to start it again i used: znc
[22:24:25] <Nighthawk> got [ >> ] [pid: 29720] [ ** ] ZNC 1.9.x-nightly-20210619-68864541
[22:25:00] <bookworm> use --foreground
[22:25:11] <bookworm> then it'll log to stdout
[22:25:58] <Nighthawk> still. (port is open in firewall)
[22:26:22] <bookworm> still can't find logs?
[22:26:22] <Nighthawk> this is the log: https://pastebin.com/AQm5bk2b
[22:26:57] <bookworm> yes, now connect to it
[22:27:04] <Nighthawk> also, i don't know what is the webadmin port
[22:27:12] <Nighthawk> i tried and i'm getting "Host disconnected" 
[22:27:16] <Nighthawk> in mIRC
[22:27:19] <bookworm> same as the irc port by default
[22:27:25] <bookworm> (iirc)
[22:28:19] <Nighthawk> nothing :|
[22:28:30] <Nighthawk> i did ufw allow 8001/tcp
[22:28:34] <Nighthawk> and it is on the list.
[22:29:05] <bookworm> can you try on the same box first so that you don't have firewall problems?
[22:29:14] <Nighthawk> can i reset the user pass and put really simple pass just to make sure it's not a auth problem ?
[22:29:41] <bookworm> do you see an auth failure in znc logs?
[22:29:50] <Nighthawk> i don't have irc client on the box, but i have another bouncer and website on that machine and all i ever needed to open the port is just allow it on "ufw" and that is it.
[22:30:05] <Nighthawk> can't see any logs after the line i show you on pastebin
[22:30:48] <bookworm> you can flip to debug logs `znc -D` if that doesn't show a connection attempt there's your problem
[22:31:06] <Nighthawk> that means network issue, and i don't think it's firewall so it probably or my client issue (hardly doubt it because it worked so far) or firewall (but i'm sure it's not) or application network issue.
[22:31:16] *** Joins: vectr0n_ (~vectr0n@user/vectr0n)
[22:31:21] <Nighthawk> ok i'll need to kill the process and restart it with -D ?
[22:31:28] <bookworm> yes
[22:32:03] <bookworm> or if you connect via ssh you can also just forward the local port
[22:32:16] <Nighthawk> build/src/Csocket.cpp:1844 Empty, missing, or bad pemfile ... [/home/orele/.znc/znc.pem

[22:33:41] <Nighthawk> fuck it is on root
[22:33:49] <Nighthawk> maybe that is the reason it can't "see" it
[22:34:02] <DarthGandalf> don't run znc as root

[22:34:24] <Nighthawk> yeah. i'm not running it as root, i just created the file as root
[22:34:30] <DarthGandalf> but why?
[22:34:41] <bookworm> sudo make me a sandwich!
[22:34:45] <DarthGandalf> what other files did you create as root?
[22:34:57] <Nighthawk> because it was was of the commands i strarted after build so it was still created as root.
[22:35:12] <Nighthawk> had some issue installing because of the "release" in github are not working good at all.
[22:35:19] <bookworm> you shouldn't build anything as root either
[22:35:35] <Nighthawk> just build not run but you are correct
[22:35:44] <Nighthawk> because i put it on /var/local/src i need root access
[22:35:46] <DarthGandalf> Yes, "releases" in github are broken by design
[22:35:51] <Nighthawk> so i used "sudo" before.
[22:35:52] <DarthGandalf> I don't know why github does it that way
[22:36:15] <Nighthawk> DarthGandalf i would mention it and alternatives on README.md so people will know
[22:36:38] <DarthGandalf> It is mentioned on znc.in
[22:36:57] <DarthGandalf> As in, the link to source is "here" (the link to not github)
[22:37:35] <DarthGandalf> And I think we try to detect that failure mode during build process
[22:38:19] <DarthGandalf> yep, https://github.com/znc/znc/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L299
[22:38:28] <bookworm> aren't GH releases just a tarball of a repo at a specific tag?
[22:38:47] <DarthGandalf> bookworm: they miss submodules
[22:38:52] <bookworm> ah
[22:39:44] <DarthGandalf> also the release tarball doesn't require users to have swig installed
[22:40:07] <DarthGandalf> because it comes with the modperl/modpython sources pregenerated (on my machine)
[22:40:22] <Nighthawk> bookworm, thank youuuuuu mate :) working well.. also the webadmin works with same port.
[22:40:34] <DarthGandalf> missing submodules is a much bigger issue though
[22:40:40] <bookworm> indeed
[22:40:53] <Nighthawk> submodules is github or cmake terminology ?
[22:40:59] <DarthGandalf> git terminology
[22:41:07] * Nighthawk << linux amateur in here.
[22:41:10] <bookworm> I mean if you want to built from source it's expected that you need to build some dev deps too
[22:41:16] <bookworm> build*
[22:41:43] <DarthGandalf> bookworm: that's different from submodules
[22:41:47] <Nighthawk> i'm linux amateur and i succedded to build "sbnc" which i will tell you.. is not an easy job at all!
[22:42:14] <bookworm> yeah sure, regarding your comment on swig
[22:42:24] <Nighthawk> znc is almost easy breezy except 2 issues.
[22:42:42] <DarthGandalf> Or 0 issues if you follow [[Installation]] :)
