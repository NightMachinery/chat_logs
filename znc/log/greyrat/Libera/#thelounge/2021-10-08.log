[00:17:02] <MaxLeiter> bookworm: did you test https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/pull/4324 on android? 
[00:17:11] <MaxLeiter> I only have iOS
[00:17:13] <bookworm> yes
[00:17:26] <bookworm> but I have the launcher gestures disabled
[00:17:53] <bookworm> exactly because they get triggered when I don't want them too ;)
[00:18:00] <MaxLeiter> maybe its time to tabulate settings
[00:18:25] <MaxLeiter> I don't want to throw in settings willy-nilly, but an 'accessibility' section specifically would be nice
[00:19:19] <bookworm> actually, can a launcher even listen to touch events when it's not focused? Let me check
[00:20:14] <bookworm> my bad, they can't. Alas a more internal thing could, not sure if Samsung's touchwiz has gestures
[00:20:23] <bookworm> google is certainly moving there
[00:22:53] <bookworm> anything that has accessibility level access can listen if not in focus. I've used pi launcher in the past that was listening for edge events prior to google switching the back button to a gesture that conflicts with this
[00:23:42] <bookworm> https://labrat.space/irc/1fb608e4691330da/Screenshot_20211007-225307.png stock Android, apologies for the screenshot, can't select the text

[00:36:09] <MaxLeiter> if any other Android users want to speak up, today-ish is your chance 
[00:37:37] <bookworm> (it doesn't *yet* conflict with stock Android, custom roms can do whatever so...)
[00:37:51] <MaxLeiter> ah, I think I misunderstood the screenshot
[00:38:47] <bookworm> that's roughly speaking listening for single swipe gestures near the edge
[00:39:27] <bookworm> the other gestures need activation from the bottom area (the navigation bar)
[00:40:25] <MaxLeiter> yeah, I skimmed "2-button nav" and thought it was 2 finger swipe nav 
[00:41:17] <MaxLeiter> good thinking adding the single finger swipes to help
[00:43:27] <bookworm> I can't find what gestures do in Android 12, besides some gimmick face recognition nonsense

[01:52:01] <johncs> (Sorry, had a phone call) Thank you, was able to enable the setting and try it out.
[01:53:15] <johncs> I think "zooming when I meant to switch windows" is probably alright and not something we'd be able to address anyways. But "switching windows when I meant to zoom (or some other action)" could probably be fixed and would be pretty annoying.

[01:53:50] <johncs> Lemme know if anything comes out of your dogfooding :). I'll dogfood it as well on iOS, but I won't have the zoom gesture override.
[01:54:26] <bookworm> I mean as is, it doesn't switch when you properly pinch to zoom, no matter which direction

[01:58:24] <bookworm> out of interest, which ircv3 features would you like to see?
[01:59:44] <johncs> Reactions is the feature I'm most interested in. I was going to ask, is anyone working on it already? I saw some activity around the related reply spec, but it wasn't clear to me if someone was actually working on that either.
[02:00:09] <johncs> I also haven't actually gone in and figured out if TL has all the prerequisites yet
[02:00:15] *** Quits: wladimir (~doforlove@user/doforlove33) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[02:01:02] <bookworm> well, the first thing is probably UI... the single line layout as is doesn't have space for reactions. The more "conversation" like layout would, at the cost of message density (some love it, some hate it)
[02:01:23] *** Joins: wladimir (~doforlove@user/doforlove33)
[02:01:42] <bookworm> as for the core functionality, that should probably go into irc-framework rather than TL for the protocol itself
[02:02:00] <bookworm> not sure what itsonlybinary already did on the kiwi side of things
[02:06:57] <johncs> Discord's reactions are laid out horizontally beneath single messages. I figured we'd do the same thing, though we'd need to figure out what to do about long reaction strings.
[02:10:46] <johncs> #4132 mentions that "underlying IRC client library" handles message-tags so might be good on irc-framework side (which I'm guessing is the same thing). I think that's all that's needed, though echo-message is suggested (but I don't yet understand why that's important).
[02:10:46] <thelounge-bot> 07» 09Open issue 12#4132 - Display IRCv3 message-tags in the web client https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/issues/4132
[02:14:31] <bookworm> the echo-message cap is already enabled in TL iirc
[02:17:40] <johncs> rad :)
[02:18:13] <bookworm> I mean, come on. How else do you want to make sure that you only display a message when the server actually received it? ;) much easier
[02:20:58] <johncs> "our client might feel unresponsive, but dammit it's accurate"
[02:21:28] <bookworm> to be honest, I'd rather have it this way yes, then you at least know that it is visible to the rest of the network
[02:21:51] <bookworm> (yes, yes, you could dedupe when it comes back to get the best of both worlds)
[02:22:49] <johncs> I like FB messenger's and telegram's little icon showing a message's status among "sending", "received by server", "received by recipient", "read"
[02:23:13] <johncs> We can't get the latter two, but a little icon to indicate that we're not sure a message has been received by the server yet might be cool
[02:23:34] <bookworm> visual clutter :P
[02:25:57] <Activ8> Don’t want too much in it otherwise it might become like discord
[02:26:05] <Activ8> simplicity is better
[02:26:20] <johncs> Haha fair, i have had the same thought with those clients. Could make the timestamp next to the message could be replaced or styled to indicate pendingness. We do have some advantages when it comes to our lack of more than 2 states.
[02:26:42] <johncs> But honestly I don't really mind the lack of knowledge re: pending-ness.
[02:26:58] <Activ8> You need time stamp though for the logs really
[02:27:00] <bookworm> I mean as is, you do know
[02:27:14] <Activ8> you know if you are disconnected anyway you get a connection error
[02:27:32] <johncs> oh, is TL actually only displaying messages when it gets the echo back?
[02:27:45] <bookworm> yee
[02:27:58] <bookworm> yes, assuming the cap is enabled, which for all modern ircds it is
[02:28:07] <johncs> Haha I had no idea
[02:28:25] <bookworm> I mean that's literally what the cap is for, so that you don't need to buffer
[02:30:06] <johncs> Interesting, I didn't realize clients were actually doing that. I assumed everyone was doing the bit in the spec where it says "you may display messages before getting the echo back to reduce lag".
[02:30:27] <johncs> Since I haven't noticed all this time, seems fine as is
[02:30:52] <bookworm> you tend to notice on a crappy connection... open devtools and limit the bandwith / add lag
[02:31:02] <Activ8> lol
[02:31:21] <Activ8> i sometimes get it when my signal goes to 1 bar
[02:31:34] <Activ8> i can just about send a message pn 4G 1 bar lol
[02:31:42] <Activ8> pn = on
[02:33:48] <johncs> interesting... I'll keep an eye out when I'm on mobile. I do think a non-annoying way to show pending messages wouldn't be too hard to design if we wanted to
[02:33:57] <johncs> I'm still much more interested in reactions though
[02:34:08] <johncs> I find the lack of them to be a pretty constant annoyance
[02:39:54] <Activ8> There wouldn’t be any pending messages though until you are d/c from your server, well unless the server looses connected but then you wouldn’t see a thing apart from a red error box saying connecting.
[02:41:08] <johncs> Hm, I don't quite understand Activ8. What would you call a message that been sent out through the socket, but an echo has not bee received from the server.
[02:41:39] <Activ8> Would be just send and receive surely?
[02:42:12] <johncs> Sorry, I still don't understand. What do you mean by just send and receive?
[02:43:19] <Activ8> Never mind I don’t entirely know myself I’m just assuming 
[02:45:03] <johncs> Gotcha, no worries. What I mean by a pending message is a message you've typed and hit enter for. Your browser will then send that to the lounge server, who will grab it and then send it to the actual irc server, who will do things with it and then the irc server will send back an echo message (containing what you typed) back to the lounge server,
[02:45:03] <johncs> who will then finally send it back to your client. Currently the message isn't displayed at all until the very last step of that process. But we could show messages earlier, but they would be "pending" messages.
[02:46:28] <Activ8> I get you, but if you had a light system for example in replace of the time.  It would be chaos lol all you would see is flashing lights all over your chat client.
[02:47:00] <Activ8> I mean I wake up with one channel 10k unread messages 
[02:47:19] <Activ8> some are very active 
[02:47:40] <johncs> Oh, I think I understand you. I don't mean anything related to "read" vs "unread" when I say pending.
[02:47:51] <johncs> None of those 10k messages would be pending
[02:48:09] <Activ8> infact it happens that fast you might see for a split second it might go straight to one colour it would be that fast
[02:48:09] <johncs> Only messages you send would ever be pending, and only for a moment (or longer if you connection is bad)
[02:48:24] <Activ8> might actually be a big overhead with some channels been very chatty
[02:49:08] <Activ8> If your connection was bad the client probably disconnect from the lounge server 
[02:49:27] <bookworm> johncs: do you know a network that actually supports +draft/react?

[03:46:17] <johncs> totally unrelatedly, I've been wondering. Why aren't logs in /var/log/ by default on the ubuntu install? Was surprised to find them next to the config file
[03:48:16] <johncs> Well, I don't know that /var/log/ is necessarily the best place, but having them within /etc just seemed extra odd
[03:50:35] <bookworm> /var/lib would be the better location, same for the user "DBs", need a way to split this out in the debian package
[03:50:51] <bookworm> the only sensible thing we have in /etc currently is the actual server config
[03:51:08] <bookworm> the rest should go into /var/lib according to the FSH
[03:51:56] <bookworm> will be non trivial to migrate everybody though, so this would need to be an incremental thing

[03:55:43] <Activ8> I executed it in both Ubuntu and Debian and it launched sucessfully
[03:56:09] <bookworm> that's not a high bar
[03:56:32] <Activ8> What would you class as a high bar
[03:57:08] <bookworm> rewrite the thing (within reason) to actually use the debian packaging facility so that we can piggy back on the systemd stuff and all 
[03:57:32] <bookworm> a proper rewrite is out of the question, they want you to split every single node dep that we are using
[03:57:43] <Activ8> Might be able to fix the permissions I’ve seen where they are
[03:58:20] <Activ8> the deb has increased to about 12mb from 4mb roughly because of the node modules
[03:58:31] <Activ8> and for some reason pre-4 still has sharp
[03:59:13] <bookworm> naturally
[03:59:15] <Activ8> max mentioned about it so I did a breakdown of both pre-2 and pre-4 files in node_modules and it’s increased quite a bit
[03:59:21] <bookworm> was reverted in beb5530c6518b759b473c6664a344cd729f78b30 which isn't on any tag
[03:59:24] <Activ8> max said it should be less
[03:59:54] <bookworm> it's reverted on the master branch, if you build a tag you get the tag without the revert
[03:59:56] <Activ8> but anyway it compiled fine and works but more work needs to be done on it really like you said 
[04:01:43] <johncs> (sorry, only reading the first messages now): I bet we could figure out how to let existing-installs-that-are-upgrading keep things where they're at, but give newer installs a more reasonable location (even if it really is just moving the whole thing into /opt/, which would feel fine). I've hardly ever built distro packages though so I really don't
[04:01:43] <johncs> know much about them.
[04:01:52] <Activ8> I’m going to study it tomorrow a bit more see if I can get my head around it
[04:02:20] <bookworm> Activ8: good luck, debian packaging is a mess
[04:02:35] <Activ8> its took me all day to learn enough to compile it lol
[04:02:41] <johncs> Does seems like a fun thing to look into though. I got really Python packaging tooling years ago.
[04:03:03] <bookworm> Activ8: you keep saying compiling when you shouldn't. the only thing you've compiled is the vue files and that's done by yarn
[04:03:22] <Activ8> what have I done then?
[04:03:36] <bookworm> run a script that built a package
[04:04:25] <Activ8> Isn’t compiling exactly that though?
[04:04:31] <bookworm> it doesn't built from source either, but uses the registry so scratch any sort of complilation :P
[04:04:34] <bookworm> no
[04:04:52] <bookworm> packaging != compiling. In any case, not really relevant is it
[04:05:14] <Activ8> I don’t get how some of you learn so fast in coding takes me ages to get the right words
[04:05:56] <Activ8> you are just confusing me now lol ya talking Japanese to me ha ha
[04:06:29] <Activ8> Ok then I ran a script to build a package 📦 ha ha
[04:06:30] *** Joins: chanakan5591 (~chanakan5@user/chanakan5591)
[04:07:25] <johncs> I feel that Activ8. I remember going on freenode for the first time and getting told off because I kept saying "constant time" when it was really "amortized constant time".
[04:07:44] <johncs> had only very recently learned about either concept
[04:07:56] <johncs> so much vocab
[04:07:58] <bookworm> join us in #thelounge-offtopic and we can talk about hashtables over there ;)
[04:08:23] <Activ8> Woooooooooosh
[04:11:17] <Activ8> Wait… hold on…. So what I should have done is run a script for the pre-4 tag so it builds the package (and not for the master) ? Is that why it’s so big?
[04:11:31] <Activ8> when I say big 4mb va 12mb is tiny lol
[04:12:19] <bookworm> Activ8: did you read the build script? Do you understand it?
[04:12:49] <Activ8> I read it yes, understand it - parts of it yes
[04:12:57] <Activ8> not all of it
[04:13:04] <bookworm> it fetches the version specified in debian/control from npm, as in the tagged version
[04:13:20] <bookworm> you have 4.3.0~pre.4 assuming you didn't muck with the code
[04:13:24] <bookworm> so you get exactly that
[04:13:36] <Activ8> Got ya! I’ll redo it tomorrow see what happens to it then.
[04:13:37] <bookworm> this state of the code is still using sharp
[04:13:50] <bookworm> if you redo it, you'll get the exact same result
[04:13:54] <Activ8> I didn’t change a single thing ran it from directly the master 
[04:14:16] <bookworm> building from master is not worth it, a new pre is incoming anyhow soon-ish
[04:14:24] <bookworm> (for the deb package)
[04:15:15] <Activ8> Is max doing that? I’m just learning so I can get my head around the basics but someone in here wanted it so I decided to give it a go like I did with docker 
[04:15:43] <Activ8> I’m getting there very very slowly lol 😂 
[04:16:30] <bookworm> the building part isn't the problem with the current state, fixing the current state is
[04:16:48] <Activ8> Got ya
[04:17:12] <bookworm> we basically need someone that is either motivated enough ,or already knows, how to do proper packages for debian using debhelper
[04:17:52] <bookworm> I tried to read myself into it... the documentation isn't exactly good. 3 or 4 generations of tools and they have various workflows all over the distro and leave lots of things up to the packager
[04:18:06] <bookworm> which is very much in contrast to the Arch package where I actually know how things fit together
[04:18:48] *** Joins: jmiahjones (~jmiahjone@64.44.42.165)
[04:19:36] <Activ8> I would never be good enough to repair the current problems but I’ll have fun ripping it apart to at least understand how it’s trying to work 😊.
[04:21:21] <bookworm> in short, fetch version from npm, patch to use /etc as default config location, make tarball with some meta information
[04:24:40] <Activ8> If only there was some deb gurus out there eh would be done in no time 
[04:28:29] <bookworm> the problem being that we don't actually want to adhere to the packaging guidelines of Debian, meaning the gurus tend to not like that either :P
[04:31:57] <Activ8> Ha ha I thought max was the deb god

[18:04:08] <Activ8> you need to check your logs for the lounge,I get a 502 Bad Gateway error now on slj.ma/c 
[18:05:19] <Activ8> looks like you took the rest of the services down.  So by that I assume your using the same service for each one just using a different domain that you are pointing people too
[18:05:52] <Activ8> that one service is been referenced by multiple domains, right?
[18:06:12] *** Quits: shadoozo (~shadoozo@user/shadoozo) (Quit: ZNC - https://znc.in)
[18:07:03] <satchlj> yes that's right
[18:07:23] <Activ8> https://blube.club/chat, https://slj.ma/c and https://satch.xyz/chat/ all using the one lounge service upstream
[18:08:17] <satchlj> exactly. They were all working fine except https://slj.ma/c which I added this morning
[18:08:28] <satchlj> but when I restarted things went weird
[18:08:49] <satchlj> namely 502 error
[18:09:17] <satchlj> where do I find the logs? I looked in /var/log/ but didn't see anything for thelounge
[18:09:25] <Activ8> share your full configs if you don't mind I feel that's just a part what you shared
[18:09:37] *** Joins: shadoozo (~shadoozo@user/shadoozo)
[18:10:12] <Activ8> try the command "systemctl status thelounge.service" 
[18:10:48] <Activ8> if it says it's running then it's your nginx config somewhere passing through.
[18:12:59] <Activ8> https://thelounge.chat/docs/guides/reverse-proxies#nginx
[18:14:38] <satchlj> it is not running lol
[18:14:51] <Activ8> right, it should say why
[18:14:57] <Activ8> you used that command right?
[18:15:05] <satchlj> https://bpa.st/VSCQ
[18:16:05] <satchlj> yes I used systemctl status thelounge.service
[18:16:28] <Activ8> that's fine, so atm the lounge service isn't running

[18:36:50] <Activ8> the lounge service really needs to be up and running then you deal with the nginx stuff.  I don't know how your other services was running in the first place with that state.
[18:37:01] <Activ8> it's got to come back up cleanly when you restart it as a service online

[18:38:29] <satchlj> no.... that would be a real pain
[18:38:42] <satchlj> there are a lot users

[18:40:04] <Activ8> when I first started learning linux I come up againts all sorts of problems but over time managed to fix them after playing about in test environments
[18:40:56] <satchlj> I am running 4.2 yes... and yeah lol I am having lots of problems but learning a bit more every time
[18:41:30] <Activ8> I really don't know how 2 urls was working they shouldn't have been with permission issues, if that's what is causing it.
[18:42:17] <Activ8> a restart fail like you have means there's a problem with restarting the service so it mustn't have been working properly somewhere down the line
[18:42:37] <Activ8> the service should have come up cleanly
[18:42:50] <satchlj> yes
[18:43:08] <satchlj> interesting...
[18:43:09] <Activ8> can you check the permissions on '/home/thelounge/.thelounge/packages/node_modules'
[18:43:34] <satchlj> So what I just did was thelounge start from thelounge user's home dir
[18:43:39] <satchlj> aaaaaaand
[18:43:39] <Activ8> when you restart the service are you running as root or restarting it as thelounge user
[18:43:49] <satchlj> normally root
[18:43:59] <satchlj> but I tried thelounge uer
[18:44:21] <Activ8> erm I don't think you supposed to on the .deb installer let me check my old deb documentation see if I got any lying about what i typed up
[18:44:57] <satchlj> and it worked except there are no users, the config.js is the default
[18:45:24] <satchlj> BUT https://slj.ma has the same problem as before, and https://satch.xyz/chat is not working
[18:45:30] <satchlj> *IS working
[18:45:54] <satchlj> (It's just a blank slate)
[18:46:17] <Activ8> your domains are working fine so nginx service is up. Has to be.  This is a lounge issue with the install config
[18:46:29] *** Joins: wladimir (~doforlove@user/doforlove33)

[18:54:25] *** Joins: elessar (~thend@user/elessar)

[19:02:37] <bookworm> well, yes
[19:03:18] <bookworm> do you have the deb file still?
[19:03:24] <satchlj> i have no idea why that is
[19:03:47] <bookworm> in any case, fix it by replacing the text with /etc/thelounge
[19:03:57] <bookworm> (you need root for that)
[19:04:12] <bookworm> however that should've been /etc from the package
[19:04:23] <satchlj> i do not still have the deb file
[19:04:32] <satchlj> but ok
[19:04:35] <bookworm> meaning you either did muck manually around with root rights (bad idea) or the deb is borked

[21:53:16] <mooff> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem
[21:53:32] <easymac> i think "colors would persist through nick changes" sums it up 
[21:54:16] <bookworm> they already do, it's a hash over the nick
[21:54:30] <mooff> you know what they mean, bookworm :P
[21:54:53] <bookworm> I actually don't no
[21:56:05] <easymac> err 
[21:56:15] <easymac> a hash over the nick changes when the nick changes 
[21:56:37] <easymac> e.g using /nick
[21:56:56] <Activ8> what's that going to solve?
[21:57:02] <Activ8> the colours can be customised through css
[21:57:09] *** Parts: genera (~Genera@user/genera) (Leaving)
[21:57:32] <easymac> it has nothing to do with changing what colors are presented as ... 
[21:57:46] <Activ8> what's it got to do with then
[21:58:09] <bookworm> yes, it would also change if you instead use nick@host
[21:58:29] <easymac> ... keeping a user the same color when they make common but insignificant 
[21:58:31] <bookworm> it's a hash, any change in input leads to a different output
[21:58:35] <easymac> changes to their nick 
[21:58:44] <easymac> user@host, not nick 
[21:58:51] <Activ8> just change your nick? colour will change then
[21:59:04] <easymac> am i really not explaining this well enough 
[21:59:18] <Activ8> what's the problem though?
[21:59:32] <satchlj> i get it
[21:59:39] <bookworm> you can change your ident just the same
[21:59:46] <satchlj> right now my nick is satchlj
[21:59:54] <satchlj> my username is also satchlj
[22:00:07] *** satchlj is now known as satch
[22:00:12] <satch> now my nick is satch
[22:00:19] <satch> my color has changed
[22:00:26] <Activ8> great :) it works
[22:00:35] <easymac> on irc users often make minor changes to their nicknames without intending to change their identity 
[22:00:40] <bookworm> inb4 all web gateways misusing the ident as PR space have the exact same color
[22:01:32] <satch> my username is still satchlj, so easymac is saying what if my color stays the same
[22:01:39] <Activ8> im not following, what's the problem
[22:01:42] *** satch is now known as satchlj
[22:01:42] <easymac> yes, that 
[22:02:11] <satchlj> there's no problem
[22:02:15] <satchlj> it's an idea
[22:02:30] <satchlj> it would work
[22:02:44] <bookworm> *for some specific usecase
[22:03:03] <Activ8> why? I can change what color you all are via css and I would never tell what you really are underneath
[22:03:11] <bookworm> it's easy enough to patch, feel free
[22:03:28] <easymac> hardly specific 
[22:03:41] <bookworm> https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/blob/f01a2b55eb22dc7a54cf30c859df6ef4b9dd0fda/client/js/helpers/colorClass.js
[22:03:46] <bookworm> specific enough?
[22:04:05] <easymac> :) I actually wrote the nick color code for shout some 7 years ago 
[22:04:18] *** Parts: satchlj (~satchlj@blube.club) (Blube Chat - https://blube.club/chat)
[22:04:24] <Activ8> but why do it though? 
[22:04:24] <bookworm> easy then ;P
[22:04:47] <easymac> to keep people's colors the same when they /nick 
[22:04:57] <Activ8> that's not fair
[22:05:00] <easymac> it has nothing to do with css 
[22:05:03] <Activ8> I don't want me colour to be the same
[22:05:13] <Activ8> if I change my nick I want a new color
[22:05:17] <easymac> it's my client. i don't care what color you want to be 
[22:05:27] <Activ8> that's what CSS is for.
[22:05:33] <easymac> you can set your own color to whatever you want with CSS 
[22:05:42] <easymac> what I'm describing cannot be achieved with CSS 
[22:05:42] <Activ8> so your changing the core code because it's your client? 
[22:05:49] <easymac> yikes 
[22:05:55] <easymac> it's not that deep mate 
[22:06:03] <Activ8> stop touching my colors
[22:07:09] <bookworm> my issue is that the "realname" / ident is hardly something clients really use. Meaning it's often prepopulated with nonsense. see here https://demo.thelounge.chat/#/connect
[22:07:25] <bookworm> meaning all of them would have the same color
[22:07:36] <bookworm> at least the nick is guaranteed to be unique
[22:08:21] <easymac> is it a significant portion of users in any given channel that share the same user & host? i don't know that I've ever encountered it, especially on freebies 
[22:08:27] <easymac> freenode **
[22:08:38] <bookworm> significant enough for me yes
[22:08:59] <easymac> plus the guarantee of uniqueness matters less when there are only up to 32 colors anyway 
[22:09:35] <bookworm> that defeats your argument as well
[22:09:35] <easymac> i think thelounge only uses 16 by default 
[22:09:53] <easymac> why's that 
[22:09:53] <bookworm> after all you can't tell if the same color is a clash or a nick change
[22:10:26] <bookworm> granted, if you are insane enough to show those you could maybe follow, depends on the chan traffic
[22:10:47] <easymac> that situation isn't made any worse 
[22:10:59] <bookworm> it isn't made any better either
[22:11:10] <bookworm> one usecase gets better, another worse
[22:11:29] <mooff> it's really not hard to understand easymac's motivation, i think some of you are being a bit obtuse :P
[22:11:44] <mooff> i think it's reasonable and can understand the appeal
[22:11:45] <bookworm> if you are in a chan with lots of people from a chat portal such as the demo, very much worse
[22:12:42] <bookworm> which is rather usual if you are a project with a support frontend for newbies
[22:12:57] <bookworm> pleroma comes to mind
[22:13:23] <easymac> that's a pretty specific use case 
[22:13:27] <mooff> good points
[22:13:33] <bookworm> so is yours
[22:14:07] <bookworm> who cares about the same color for the same person, you need to be able to differentiate nicks, that's the point. Not tracking people
[22:14:11] <mooff> bookworm, you did grant that in a way those portals are misusing the ident space
[22:14:16] <bookworm> if you want that, there are better tools
[22:14:25] <bookworm> chanstalker or whatever the thing was called
[22:14:37] <easymac> not tracking. just a minor convenience

[22:25:03] <johncs> I feel like this would be great as a plug-in.
[22:25:32] <johncs> I saw something about a plug-in api… did whoever was trying to make that happen leave the profject before it was finished?
[22:26:09] <bookworm> it's somewhat there as in you can hook into the client via JS, however no UI component access
[22:26:45] <bookworm> meaning you can send / hijack messages but can't mess with the components that are displayed or inject new ones
[22:27:28] <bookworm> someone would have to figure out the proper hooks to do those things, have the time and knowledge to do it. The usual resource problem
[22:27:46] <bookworm> plus this would probably mean quite a bunch of refactoring looking at the code

[23:12:10] <johncs> Oh neat, I see the docs now. They're a bit sparse 😅, but not the worst. I see there's a way to send events into the eventbus which seems plenty flexible. Could start expanding the API incrementally as needed. Like add a `plugin-v1/change-nick-color` event.
