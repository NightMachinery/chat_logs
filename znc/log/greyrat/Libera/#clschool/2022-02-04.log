[06:37:20] <neominimum> Hi, I am signalling an error with `(error "~A is not a valid function designator in form: ~A" element branch-head)` where `element` is the `car` of `branch-head` the error reads `#1='HI is not a valid function designator in form: (#1# 5 6)` whereas I'd like it to read `'HI is not a valid function designator in form: ('HI 5 6)` I have a vague idea that it may be something to do with circular references, I think. Is there a way to print this 
[06:37:20] <neominimum> without the reference?
[06:39:50] <Bike> bind *print-circle* to nil
[06:40:21] <Bike> you are right, it's due to circularity detection
[06:49:57] <neominimum> great! thanks Bike

[07:06:41] <neominimum> I got this to work by doing a (copy-tree branch-head). I incorrectly specified that `element` was the direct `car` of `branch-head` but that isn't the case, they actually have a common ancestor so are more like siblings I guess. Just binding *print-circle* to `nil` didn't work in this case unfortunately.
[07:07:48] <neominimum> not sure why the printer could see a circular reference but couldn't resolve it or didn't want to in this case
[07:08:16] <Bike> what do you mean "couldn't resolve it"?

[07:10:33] <neominimum> I mean I was just getting the same output as before, I don't know how the internals actually work so just consider me confused.

[07:12:48] <Bike> if you're using SLIME or another environment, it might rebind *print-circle* in the debugger
[07:13:28] <Bike> It is usually a good thing to have in error reporting, because without it, printing anomalous circular structures can itself result in errors, and recursive errors are really annoying
[07:14:43] <neominimum> oh okay I'll check that out
[07:16:09] <Bike> what i meant was that if you are using SLIME or something like it, that could explain why binding *print-circle* did not change how the error was printing - SLIME's own binding could override it
[07:16:38] <neominimum> got it :)

[07:22:58] <neominimum> I was trying to emulate the error that sbcl gives when attempting to evaluate something like (1 2 3) but I just noticed that it doesn't actually specify the head of the list like I was trying to in my error. It just says "Execution of form ...." so I may just take the same approach. "Form: ~A cannot be evaluated without valid function designator." or something to that effect.
[07:23:51] <neominimum> thanks, I've got to run off to work but if I get any replies I'll get back to them later.
[07:29:15] <Bike> well, i mean... if you have the form there it's pretty obvious what the first element of it is
[07:30:14] <beach> Good morning everyone!

[17:13:44] <beach> lisp123: It is easy to get carried away in making layers of abstraction, and sometimes it makes things harder to understand.  I find that I need clear protocols that are also well documented.  Docstrings just aren't enough, because they don't tell the full story from the beginning. 
[17:14:39] *** Joins: sts-q (~sts-q@212.53.219.218)
[17:15:06] <beach> lisp123: But making good protocols is hard.  And (I find that) it often takes several iterations to get it right.  Unfortunately, we don't always have the required time to do that.
[17:16:56] <lisp123> beach: Indeed, I agree with all the above. Also, after writing the code its easier to understand why a certain way is better, but when starting off, a more (usually imperative?) approach tends to come to mind
[17:17:14] <beach> lisp123: That code you gave a link to is obviously not a finished product.  It has many unconventional things that would have been fixed if it were a finished product.
[17:17:28] <lisp123> They do say its easier to write code than to read it
[17:18:05] <lisp123> Yes, its someones internal script, but still, I gave up after some time
[17:19:36] <beach> I fully understand.
