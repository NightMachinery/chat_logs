[01:16:40] <PMT> debian-keyring is a package in Debian. There are relatives of that package depending on what you need.
[01:17:42] <DeanGuss> I don't have debian, I'm trying to verify the SHA256SUMS.sign file so I can verify the iso so I can install it
[01:18:03] <ratrace> DeanGuss: just check the sha512sum taken from another mirror
[01:18:13] <jhutchins> DeanGuss: The checksums should be in the same directory as the isos.
[01:18:19] <DeanGuss> checksums yes
[01:18:42] <DeanGuss> but was the checksums file intercepted?  And why provide a SHA256SUMS.sign if there's no PGP key published anywhere to verify it?

[01:19:35] <PMT> PGP has keyservers on which keyrings are uploaded. https://www.debian.org/CD/verify lists the recent ones, assuming you trust it's not being intercepted.

[02:52:57] <derzahl> so i figure i must be missing something in debian-land
[02:53:29] <PMT> there are, as they say, one or two differences between the two
[02:53:50] <PMT> were any of the guides you found for Debian?
[02:55:29] <derzahl> yeh, i was looking up debian specific guides
[02:55:54] <derzahl> so those are the two files that they said i needed to change
[02:57:39] <derzahl> oh, i think maybe i found it. looks like update-initramfs ignores the keyfile arguement in /etc/crypttab for root
