[00:41:27] <ljharb> lol all of it is the point
[00:41:37] <ljharb> you can do that a million ways, 2 of which you already showed

[00:41:57] *** Joins: c17r (~c17r@c17r.com)
[00:41:57] <ljharb> there’s no “better” way, the best way depends on your exact use case, and the semantics involved
[00:41:57] <rendar> should i use nested spans, or siblings? which is better and why?
[00:42:08] <rendar> semantics are:
[00:42:14] <rendar> <key><Function>
[00:42:20] <rendar> F10HOME
[00:42:22] <ljharb> and since you definitely want space between the two, and since you probably don’t want the f10 clickable, that suggests a direction
[00:42:30] <ljharb> Right but “f10 home” is far more readable

[06:00:42] <ljharb> ok, so you have to assign it to a variable whose type describes the object
[06:00:43] <systemfault> It's easy to hack it...  const { user_id } = search as { user_id: string } would work... but you shouldn't have "any" in the first place.

[06:05:43] <chovy> ljharb: aside from typescript how is deno worse/

[06:06:21] <ljharb> chovy: sorry no packaging system, obv there’s a module system
[06:06:27] <systemfault> Deno doesn't have to deal with legacy async APIs, that's the only advantage.
[06:06:32] <chovy> i like that. its a plus for me.
[06:06:34] <KevinX> Better to type search, or if not then type the restructured value. Not convert search

[06:07:32] <systemfault> KevinX: Both are dirty.... because search is of type "any"
[06:07:50] <ljharb> (and “dur, let’s just import from URLs” is not better, it’s far worse, just like browsers are)
[06:07:51] <KevinX> how many props does search have? It should be easy to set that up
[06:07:51] <systemfault> KevinX: But yes, if it wasn't a any, your way would probably be nicer.
[06:07:59] <chovy> deno is slow. that's the only thing i don't like

[06:08:17] <ljharb> chovy: lol speed is one of its primary selling points
[06:08:33] <KevinX> Deno uses rust, so it should be "blazingly fast"
[06:08:43] <systemfault> Node uses C++... and?
[06:08:48] <ljharb> KevinX: it’s core is also JS (not TS anymore)
[06:09:09] <ljharb> Luminos: not going to answer you any further until you’re authed. You’ll need to re-ask so others can hear your question.
[06:09:16] <KevinX> Ah that's surprising. They probably still support TS with zero config though

[06:14:26] <falafel_> sickdyd, you'd typically assert the type of `event.target` there like `(event.target as HTMLSelectElement).valu`
[06:14:27] <sickdyd> I was thinking to use a handler and cast the type of event.target.value

[07:13:57] <ljharb> Guest80: but if the time is changing it’s because you are setting it every refresh, to be clear

[07:22:52] <Guest80> Yea I am avoiding as many cookies as possible in my app
[07:23:00] <gde33> the cookie law doesn't require popups that way
[07:23:16] <Guest80> I know
[07:23:41] <Guest80> I am trying to fix a github project which basically replaces a paid app like cookiepro
[07:23:57] <Guest80> https://github.com/bmihelac/django-cookie-consent/issues/49
[07:24:00] <gde33>  
[07:24:04] <Guest80> This guy brought it up
[07:24:12] <Guest80> But I don't understand his code
[07:24:19] <gde33> systemfault: I wrote this treasure one time :) sheet.innerHTML = document.cookie.indexOf('loggedin=1')!=-1?".out{display:none}":".in{display:none}";
[07:24:25] <Guest80> I said there needs to be an easier way
[07:24:47] <gde33> Guest80: local storage
[07:25:01] <Guest80> I know of that also
[07:25:13] <Guest80> But stripe uses cookies
[07:26:23] <Guest80> All I need to do is change the expiration in that github project to be static
[07:26:26] <gde33> stripe is always compatible with GDPR as the user needs to pay
[07:26:40] <Guest80> even if you use their iframes?
[07:26:58] <Guest80> I get cookies from them when I use their iframes embedded into my site
[07:27:13] <gde33> they are needed to pay
[07:27:34] <Guest80> Yea but they are third party cookies intruding on my site and to me that is no good for the law
[07:27:43] <gde33> GDPR has no issues with that
[07:28:28] <Guest80> Are you sure? Then why the whole getting users to agree to cookies?
[07:28:48] <gde33> think of it like this, if you ask the user if they want to allow cookies or not it must first be possible to offer both options
[07:28:55] <Guest80> gdpr and cookie law may be 2 different things
[07:29:10] <Guest80> right
[07:29:14] <ljharb> Guest80: the only cookie you should need is a session token
[07:29:19] <ljharb> everything else, put in the database
[07:29:20] <gde33> if they don't want the cookies they are rendered unable to pay
[07:29:42] <Guest80> exactly that is what happens
[07:29:52] <ljharb> Guest80: part of GDPR is that you have to tell them why you use the cookie, and how to block it, etc
[07:30:02] <gde33> this is why it specifically allows functional cookies
[07:30:24] <Guest80> so even spying google with recaptcha cookies is a functional cookie?
[07:30:36] <gde33> no, that is of no use to the user
[07:30:47] <Guest80> but stripe is?
[07:30:56] <gde33> the user must be able to pay
[07:31:12] <gde33> they sensibly want the cookie - or they cant pay
[07:31:29] <Guest80> ok i get that but even recaptcha is more useful to me than the user to prevent spam?
[07:31:37] <gde33> if I put a product in my shopping cart I expect it to be there
[07:32:06] <gde33> google doesn't just use their cookies for functional things, you must ask first
[07:32:34] <Guest80> ok
[07:33:05] <Guest80> i still want to be on the safe side though
[07:33:12] <gde33> the real issue is that US law specifically allows no privacy for foreiners
[07:33:16] <ljharb> captchas arent really useful
[07:33:24] <ljharb> just do serverside behavior analysis, it’s more effective.
[07:33:49] <ljharb> meaning, look at each request, and requests over time from the same ip or user agent or with the same content
[07:34:17] <Guest80> Yes ljharb i am using redis to prevent them from spamming
[07:34:32] <ljharb> not sure that’s what redis is for, but ok
[07:34:48] <thumbs> redis is a key/value store
[07:34:49] <Guest80> i am storing a cache value of the IP and form if they submit again

[07:35:11] <Guest80> they can submit again after like 1 hour

[07:35:30] <thumbs> using redis for abuse mitigation is a bit silly, but OK
[07:35:42] <Guest80> haha what would you use it for then?
[07:35:58] <thumbs> caching key/value pairs
[07:35:59] <KevinX> Storing an IP address might be a gdpr concern
[07:36:04] <twainwek> how can i get '1234' in 'hello world-1234 end'? i'ver tried MyString.search(/world-\d+/) but i am not sure how to get 1234 itself
[07:36:11] <thumbs> KevinX: that too
[07:36:23] <Guest80> it is the cache though so it goes away. I encode the IP so it appears encrypted
[07:36:53] <gde33> twainwek: #regex
[07:37:10] <twainwek> it's a js question. i want to know how to do capturing in js
[07:37:41] <KevinX> twainwek you create a match group with ()
[07:38:17] <gde33> twainwek: regex is kinda hard, the channel is very useful
[07:38:33] <twainwek> ah, i need to do .match instead of .search
[07:38:45] <gde33> ye
[07:38:48] <Guest80> ljharb -1 did not work for expiration unfortunately
[07:39:01] <KevinX> `'hello world-1234'.match(/world-(\d+)/)`

[23:01:03] <Rockwood> KevinX, its just for start after progress i will be make a 3D game
[23:01:15] <KevinX> nice
[23:01:24] <Rockwood> but firstly start with basics
[23:01:35] <Rockwood> this is my vision
[23:02:05] <KevinX> Should be good
[23:02:07] <Rockwood> as a player will be come
[23:02:14] <Rockwood> there
[23:02:20] <Rockwood> when it will be ready
[23:02:22] <Maxdamantus> ljharb: btw, Wikipedia has this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_light
[23:02:22] <Maxdamantus> > Amber light (also known as 'orange light' or 'yellow light')
[23:02:34] <Maxdamantus> I'd never call it an amber light though.
[23:02:43] <Rockwood> anyway good night
[23:02:47] <KevinX> Doesnt japan call the green light a blue light?
[23:02:49] <Rockwood> cya friends
[23:02:50] <KevinX> Rockwood see ya
[23:02:55] <Maxdamantus> Pretty sure most people here call it "orange" or "yellow", but it looks more orange to me.
[23:03:02] <Rockwood> here amost 1 AM

[23:03:49] <ljharb> Maxdamantus: i realize the actual color is amber - orangey/yellow - but i have never once heard anyone call it an orange light. there's a kids game, red light green light yellow light, for example
[23:04:10] <Maxdamantus> (the exact colour might be different in other countries; in NZ there's basically the same set of traffic light used everywhere, with slight differences in technology (eg, old incandescent vs. new LEDs)
[23:04:11] <qswz> I'd love cities wwithout traffic lights, without cars
[23:04:19] <ljharb> Maxdamantus: at least this is in the US, i guess you're in a different country
[23:04:20] <KevinX> the traffic light is yellow where I'm from
[23:04:27] *** robertparkerx is now known as Knowsin
[23:04:47] <Maxdamantus> )
[23:04:54] <ljharb> in the US, calling it anything but a yellow light would get you a very weird look
[23:04:55] <qswz> like 50% of space is used by cars
[23:05:46] <Maxdamantus> In the road code, it seems to be described as "yellow", but interestingly our COVID-19 "traffic light" system uses "orange": https://covid19.govt.nz/traffic-lights
[23:06:00] <Maxdamantus> so I suspect orange is the more conventional way of looking at it.
[23:06:08] <ljharb> in NZ, perhaps

[23:23:03] <lf94> I'm trying to just shorten a function type a bit. I was trying to avoid a type alias but I think I can't: function a<T extends SuperDuperLongTypeName>(f: T): T { ... }
[23:23:16] <lf94> TS just tells me T can be unrelated to the value I'm returning
