[00:52:23] <sleepydog> i see. are the server and netcat on the same machine?
[00:52:42] <Anarchos> yes
[00:53:41] <d_bot_> <monk> i was thinking that too lol
[00:54:08] <sleepydog> if you're on linux, did you check to see exactly where the server was blocked? strace -k -p $pid or looking at /proc/$pid/stack would do it
[00:54:29] <Anarchos> well, i am not on linux...
[00:54:36] <Anarchos> though i have strace
[00:54:39] <sleepydog> oh, ok
[00:55:23] <sleepydog> it's just very strange if server is blocked on a read() sys call and client blocked on a write() sys call, unless there was a network issue, which doesn't seem possible in your setup
[00:57:38] <Anarchos> it seems to always block after the same amount of bytes transferred, but this amount depends of the sleep() argument i add to slow down the server processing of data. Very strange, i thought there is maybe a buffer full somewhere
[01:00:19] <sleepydog> maybe it's trying to copy or resize a buffer and waiting to take a lock or something. is the code shareable? sounds interesting
[01:01:36] <Anarchos> sure,just wait a minute
[01:03:21] <Anarchos> https://github.com/Sylvain78/Preuves the serv and client are two shell scripts reproducing the problem, once you find your way through my awful dune files....

[12:24:16] <d_bot_> <octachron> ocalIDE is not exactly a frequently used IDE. Does it has lsp support?

[12:26:21] <octachron> It doesn't seem to support it, nor merlin. Except if you cannot live without eclipse, I would advise to try another IDE (emacs, vim, VScode, ...) .
[12:34:58] <sabas3dgh> ocabot I would use Emacs if I have to. but I need a good instruction. a week ago I did wonder off a lot trying to make CPP work on EMacs which it didn't.

[20:08:48] <d_bot_> <NULL> ocaml-language-server is a now outdated lsp
[20:09:00] <d_bot_> <NULL> Prefer ocaml-lsp-server in opam
[20:09:21] <sabas3dgh> NULL So I should delete it. the sublime package I mean
[20:09:35] <d_bot_> <NULL> I don't know how the package works
[20:10:13] <d_bot_> <NULL> If the LSP protocol is strict enough, you may make it work by aliasing ocamllsp to ocaml-language-server
[20:14:40] <sabas3dgh> NULL a work-around. I see. Good Idea.  💯
[20:15:26] <Fardale> If sublime support LSP server, you may not need a package to make it work.
[20:18:10] <sabas3dgh> Fardale;  NULL; as I can see here  https://lsp.sublimetext.io/language_servers/
[20:18:53] <sabas3dgh> and couple of other materials at least on sublime grounds I have to install reason plugins ( server + sublime plugin)
[20:19:40] <sabas3dgh> Is it a good idea? as far as I can gather; Reason is a web framework written is OCaml?!!!🤷‍♀️

[20:28:09] <d_bot_> <glennsl> that's possibly even more outdated than `ocaml-language-server`.
[20:28:38] <d_bot_> <glennsl> You could probably use the same approach and just substitute `ocaml-lsp-server` though
[20:37:52] <sabas3dgh> glennsl; which one is the updated lsp server?
[20:38:20] <sabas3dgh> and where is the other ocaml Chat location? Matrix; slack ....?
[20:38:42] <sabas3dgh> d_bot_ ?

[22:55:47] <d_bot_> <sabas3dgh> Hello; I have been landed 😁
[22:56:06] <d_bot_> <sabas3dgh> howdy folks
[22:56:25] <d_bot_> <Butanium (@me on answer)> o/
[22:56:36] <d_bot_> <sabas3dgh> back to the issue at hand...
[22:56:55] <d_bot_> <sabas3dgh> setup the sublime text 😁
[22:58:09] <d_bot_> <sabas3dgh> it says and I am rephrasing here: if you want to have a better Ocaml support you need to install and configure reason for sublime text!
[22:58:44] <d_bot_> <sabas3dgh> What is reason? another language based on Ocaml? like Emacs Lisp and whatever else Lisp
[22:58:59] <d_bot_> <sabas3dgh> or is it a framework for Ocmal ....
[22:59:05] <d_bot_> <sabas3dgh> another Q!
[23:01:10] <d_bot_> <sabas3dgh> I am new to Ocaml..... I used to ORM and web frameworks, H2 database, DI (dependency Injection) and Aspect Oriented stuff.
[23:01:46] <d_bot_> <sabas3dgh> How much of these have similar tools and foundation here in OCaml?

[23:20:43] <d_bot_> <glennsl> You won't find this kind of over-engineered enterprise stuff for OCaml, or any functional language.Mostly because it's just not necessary, but also in part because these are much smaller ecosystems.
[23:21:16] <d_bot_> <glennsl> A good starting point for web is Dream, I think:  https://aantron.github.io/dream/
[23:22:13] <d_bot_> <glennsl> For functional approaches to dependency injection you might want to have a look at this series of articles: <https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/dependencies/>

[23:24:52] <d_bot_> <glennsl> Reason is for the most part just a different syntax for OCaml. `ocaml-lsp` supports both and supercedes both `ocaml-language-server` and `reason-language-server`.  Anywhere you see either, substitute it with `ocaml-lsp`.
