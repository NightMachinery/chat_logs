[02:05:16] <relipse> Is it possible to work full time for a Canadian company while I reside in the US? (via remote working)
[02:05:32] <__adrian> depends on things but yes
[02:05:45] <relipse> do I need to apply for a canadian visa or something?
[02:06:02] <__adrian> wouldn't think so, but i'm not the person to ask
[02:06:10] <__adrian> talk to the company
[02:07:05] <Byteflux> US govt doesn't care that your employer is in Canada, they only care that you're paying your income taxes.
[02:07:19] <Byteflux> You should talk to a tax specialist if you don't know how any of this works.
[02:07:51] <__adrian> that too, but it also depends on the company, how they're set up, what they're willing to do
[02:08:06] <__adrian> some will and some won't
[02:09:20] <__adrian> e.g., when i lived in california, a company i interviewed with couldn't hire me because having an employee that lived there would mean they "do business" there and would have cost them 20× my salary in taxes.
[02:09:25] <__adrian> no, not an exaggeration.
[02:09:55] <__adrian> and that was both me and them in the US.
[02:10:20] <Byteflux> That's separate from your own responsibility. As a worker your personal responsibility ends with you paying taxes to your state and to the federal govt.
[02:10:36] <__adrian> oh yes
[02:10:46] <__adrian> but it'll be a factor in whether they'll even hire you.
[02:11:45] <__adrian> e.g., regarding the work visa, the company will tell you whether you need one before they'll interview/hire you.

[02:14:11] <__adrian> if the offer is for a "contractor" more likely to be workable
[02:15:15] <Byteflux> Yep, if you're just doing contract labor you are basically self-employed.
[02:15:27] <Byteflux> And it doesn't matter (for you) where your employer is based out of.
[02:15:35] <relipse> oh I see
[02:15:46] <entuland> aye, works like that for me
[02:15:47] <Byteflux> The employer might be subject to certain requirements but that's not your responsibility.
[02:16:50] <Byteflux> Tax rules surrounding self-employment in the US can bed confusing so you may need a tax specialist to guide you if you're not able to study it thoroughly.
[02:16:56] <Byteflux> s/bed/bit/
[02:17:36] <__adrian> i work in one state and live in another. got a tax guy and never looked back
[02:18:22] <Byteflux> Confusing because in a typical employment scenario, 90% of the tax work is handled by your employer's payroll division. When you're self-employed all of the burden falls onto you to get it right.
[02:18:43] <Byteflux> And all the deductions and such you can take

[03:11:01] <Blondie101010> well check that now
[03:11:10] <Blondie101010> I kind of suspect that can not be the issue
[03:11:11] <ePirat> indeed it is PrivateTmp=true issue… thanks so much TinoDidriksen!

[03:11:56] <ePirat> (let's see if changing that actually helps though, maybe it is just part of the issue…)
[03:12:28] <Blondie101010> it should apply to the process's directory tree which should match

[03:18:32] <Blondie101010> oh that can matter
[03:18:37] <Blondie101010> not the same process
[03:19:00] <Blondie101010> hmmmmmm
[03:19:10] <ePirat> Just to be sure I tried to create a file in the directory with the user I configured in php-fpm to run it with and it works as expected…
[03:19:15] <Blondie101010> nahhh, it's just PHP involved
[03:20:12] <Blondie101010> I'd start by testing with no open_basedir to make sure that does exactly what you want
[03:20:26] <Blondie101010> then add the entry only for that path and retest
[03:22:34] <ePirat> it works fine without the open_basedir set

[03:33:28] <ePirat> if not whats even the point of having a special command for editing…
[03:33:43] <Blondie101010> you'd put the directive in something like /etc/systemd/system/php-fpm.service.d/noprivatetmp

[03:34:42] <Blondie101010> as shown, I usually do it manually so I wouldn't know, though you could find out in 2 seconds: systemctl status php-fpm # and check the process start time
