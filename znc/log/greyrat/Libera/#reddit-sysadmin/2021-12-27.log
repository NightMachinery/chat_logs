[08:20:42] <mjt> yuken: not sure the majority of drop outs can say the same thing
[08:21:43] <mjt> like of like losers who bomb uni saying 'but gates Zuckerberg and musk bombed' yeah mate you're not going to be a billionaire get your ass back in the lecture theatre
[08:22:27] <yuken> mjt, I would say that the reason people who go to college make more money in the long run is unrelated to professional education (outside of a select few areas like medical stuff, where it's basically a requirement).
[08:22:44] <yuken> But that people who drop out are more often than not, not as motivated as though who follow what their mentors and parents say - that college is a good thing.
[08:23:12] <yuken> More and more people are starting to realise that college is a scam though, so that may be changing as time goes on.
[08:23:15] <mjt> as in you say they have more focus on long term goals or something? or generally more dedicated?
[08:23:21] <yuken> Both.
[08:23:26] <mjt> I see
[08:23:32] <mjt> Could well be true 
[08:23:56] <yuken> College is an indicator of success not because it legitimately advances you further than learning yourself or in more "unprofessional" situations, but because by going to college you show that you have motivation & dedication to long-term planning, and dealing with even more stuff you don't like (schooling).
[08:24:23] <yuken> Whereas those who drop out, at least classically, are more often than not not as dedicated towards such success as the people who stick it out.
[08:24:44] <mjt> yes. although for a minority it holds them back, such as gates zuck etc
[08:25:32] <yuken> The dude I'm working for is also a HS dropout, started a business and made some software for government - probation/parole stuff.
[08:25:39] <yuken> And now is quite wealthy thanks to that, and is what I'm working on.
[08:29:26] <mjt> getting that sweet tender money
[08:29:36] <mjt> nice thing about gubmint contracts
[08:29:45] <mjt> Is they tend not to go bust
[08:30:07] <yuken> mhmm.
[08:30:28] <yuken> mjt, I was worried I was walking into a "progressive startup" - you know the ones, toxic-positive culture with no hierarchy (officially*).
[08:30:31] <yuken> Thank god it isn't that.
