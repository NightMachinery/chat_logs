[01:24:08] <ska> When I look at openssh vulnerabilities I dont see any in 2021 columns but it lists one: https://www.cvedetails.com/product/585/Openbsd-Openssh.html?vendor_id=97

[01:24:58] <skill> ska: i know lastpass has had a few critical vulnerabilities reported, but afaik, the only one that actually resulted in a breach was reported.
[01:25:20] <skill> There's never a 100% guaranteed (unless you have insider info), but from what I know, none of the issues have impacted people's password vaults.
[01:31:38] <lacroix> LastPass and OpenSSH aren't related
[01:33:26] <skill> and yes, that too :)
[01:34:03] <shibboleth> isn't lastpass something, something "we'll store your passwords in the cloud, it's totally safe, pinky-swear"?
[01:34:20] <skill> shibboleth: still better than not using a password manager.
[01:34:27] <lacroix> I took 1 look at LastPass years ago and said "hell no!"
[01:34:35] <skill> but they do encrypt your vault with your own password
[01:34:35] <lacroix> (I use KeePassXC)
[01:34:49] <lacroix> my KeePass database never leaves my devices
[01:35:12] <skill> And that works for you :)
[01:35:21] <shibboleth> don't people have tpms and yubikey-whatever?
[01:35:35] <skill> not every service supports it, unfortunately.
[01:35:47] <skill> hoping for the day webauthn is more universally accessible
[01:36:13] *** Joins: redstarcomrade (uid99592@user/redstarcomrade)
[01:36:54] <shibboleth> well, you can use the tpm and presumably yubikeys as pin/phrase/cert-protected password managers
[01:37:15] <shibboleth> which works transparently in the browser, like firefox
[01:37:33] <skill> shibboleth: if that works for you, that's awesome

[01:37:56] <shibboleth> no third-party software required

[01:38:26] <shibboleth> lacroix, rsync.net? :P
[01:38:48] <skill> i just hope for the day passwords become meaninglss.
[01:38:51] <skill> meaningless
[01:38:53] <shibboleth> no
[01:38:55] <shibboleth> no, no, no
[01:38:58] <skill> but it'll take a while before that's the case
[01:39:06] <shibboleth> that's the insidious thing about win11

[18:27:51] <electr0n> they neglect to envision the non-digital attack surface, such that here in WA we have a HUGE mailboxing problem. My entire neighborhood actually coordinated the installation of locked mailboxes.
[18:29:17] <[iz]> for caps, i've used password schemes before where i just type one hand w/ caps and one hand lower case, including my weird non-standard typing quirks
[18:29:44] <[iz]> so easy for me to remember but hard for attackers to guess about
[18:30:06] <[iz]> and instantly makes the password much harder to bruteforce
[18:30:17] <skill> We just need more product/HW vendors to support non-password authentication mechanisms
[18:30:32] <skill> The day my mom can use her fingerprint to authenticate with her bank, we've won.
[18:30:47] <electr0n> ugh, need to figure out why this damn notification script stopped working. breaks irssi every privmsg.
[18:30:54] <[iz]> password will always still be a good idea in addition
[18:31:16] <[iz]> as fingerprints can be stolen fairly easily
[18:31:51] <[iz]> (can be done with a high res press photo of a german politician)
[18:32:06] <skill> [iz]: nothing is 100%. but statistically speaking, it's safer.
[18:32:17] <skill> but i hear you, maybe keep passwords, just make them mean nothing.
[18:32:31] <[iz]> it's called 2 factor auth for a reason

[23:28:01] <jennifer> Why does turning it off and back on weekly work? It doesn't say in the article
[23:30:17] <MadCamel> It doesn't. They're misinformed and/or lying.
[23:31:07] <piou> jennifer: it's hard to say what the author of the article had in mind, but many malwares live in RAM. Phones are a good target for that since they don't get rebooted as often as computers. If you have a way to execute malicious code on a device there are advantages to remain in RAM as that makes malware analysis much harder and leaves much less traces.
[23:31:14] <MadCamel> The idea is that some malware remains in memory only. Turning it off clears the memory. In actual practice most malware will start itself back up on boot. If it has enough access to steal all your data it can certainly hook the boot process as well
[23:31:37] <jennifer> "The NSA issued a “best practices” guide for mobile device security last year in which it recommends rebooting a phone every week as a way to stop hacking."

[23:32:30] <Hash> And who knows what else is going on
[23:32:35] <piou> Well, as MadCamel said it won't prevent malwares that don't live in RAM, but it will stop those that do.
[23:32:40] <Hash> true
[23:32:59] <jennifer> I understand, it's just one layer of defense and rebooting once a week or two can't hurt. I just wasn't sure I understood the rationale

[23:33:29] <Hash> malware equivalent of TSR viruses
[23:33:36] <Hash> terminate but stay resident
[23:34:02] <jennifer> Rebooting would be useless for TSR viruses right?
[23:34:10] <Hash> No
[23:34:18] <Hash> Depending on how the malare is loaded
[23:34:30] <Hash> if it's in some boot sector or mbr, yeah, you're fucked. it'll load every boot.
[23:34:43] <jennifer> I wonder if this advice applies to traditional computers too, considering there are RAM malware too, though probably not as often
[23:34:44] <Hash> if coming from another source after boot, then no
[23:34:49] <jennifer> True

[23:35:38] <piou> jennifer: it definitely applies to computers too, but people don't tend to need that advice, they reboot their computers more often than their phones anyway
