[00:27:31] <ash_worksi> I finally have a more English-y question. I have a list of emails per user whose services for some number of addresses expire on a particular date. I want to concisely describe a list of "date: n" where n is the number of emails that expire. What I wrote so far is: The following list shows the number of emails you registered that will expire on a particular date:\n    Oct 20, 2021: 3\n    Oct 21, 
[00:27:37] <ash_worksi> 2021: 2\n    Oct 23, 2021: 2" << that is of course example data

[00:28:16] <ash_worksi> I don't really like the "on a particular date"
[00:28:21] <ash_worksi> part
[00:29:22] <ash_worksi> I guess "for each date" sounds a bit better
[00:29:31] <ash_worksi> or "on"
[00:29:52] <ash_worksi> "on each given date" ?
[00:31:23] *** Quits: ralinux (~saje@37.156.188.75) (Quit: Leaving)
[00:31:32] <ash_worksi> or maybe "The following *dates* show ... which expire on each date."
[00:32:11] <ash_worksi> hmm... no I like that worse.
[00:32:22] <ash_worksi> s/worse/less
[00:32:22] <chat> ash_worksi meant to say: hmm... no I like that less.

[00:56:28] <GuiToris> thank you, we call this a pullover, but I rarely hear this from native English speakers
[00:56:45] <MetaNova> it is probably more-appropriately called a pullover
[00:56:52] <MetaNova> due to the collar and buttons
[00:57:04] <MetaNova> but I consider a pullover a type of sweater
[00:57:13] <GuiToris> do you use the word pullover at home?
[00:57:19] <GuiToris> (home = America)
[00:57:28] <MetaNova> very rarely
[00:58:00] <MetaNova> I didn't even recall a pullover existed until you mentioned it
[00:58:34] <GuiToris> then I think I'm better off learning it as a sweater
[00:59:14] <MetaNova> so long as you know there is a difference, it's my opinion more (English-speaking) people will understand sweater

[10:08:59] <StayHungry> pussipupu: what's the original question?
[10:09:19] <Voxel> > What do you think? Is it polite enough? "Would you allow me to add a little touch to the recent drawing?"
[10:09:40] <pussipupu> One thing I
[10:09:42] <StayHungry> overly polite
[10:10:05] <pussipupu> 'd certainly change though would be s/you allow me to add/if I added/
[10:10:11] <pussipupu> Um
[10:10:17] <Voxel> I'm trying to be polite because it's their drawing they shared online.
[10:10:22] <Voxel> It's their work.
[10:10:28] <pussipupu> s/you allow me to add/it be OK if I added/
[10:10:41] <Voxel> Usually, if someone want to edit someone's painting it's already nearly impolite.
[10:10:58] <pussipupu> “Do you mind if I add something to your recent drawing?” is direct but polite I'd say
[10:11:10] <StayHungry> +1
[10:11:34] <pussipupu> But again, it's going to depend on the specific relationship and subculture in question
[10:11:54] <pussipupu> So you're not allowed to sue me if you use my suggestions and it goes badly :þ (also I'm skint)

[17:55:58] <CuriosTiger> New iPhone.
[17:56:15] <CuriosTiger> but transferring everything over is going to be a pain, so I'm procrastinating even on that.
[18:00:06] <StayHungry> no wonder, some part of your mind simply refuses to indulge in the digital slavery of Apple's closed environment :D
[18:00:54] <CuriosTiger> I'm already in Apple's closed environment, StayHungry
[18:01:04] <CuriosTiger> And on the phone, I don't care that much.
[18:01:08] <CuriosTiger> On the computer, it bothers me more.
[18:01:22] <CuriosTiger> but I don't want to build and manage my own photo syncing service
[18:01:33] <CuriosTiger> or my own mail solution (tried that, got overrun by spammers)
[18:01:59] <CuriosTiger> I don't want to maintain and host my own offsite backup solution anymore.
[18:02:43] <CuriosTiger> in the absence of wanting to deal with all that, the only real alternatives are Apple ecosystem or Google ecosystem.
[18:03:14] <ln> if you are already using an iphone, isn't transferring everything going to be extremely simple
[18:03:26] <CuriosTiger> Mostly, yes.
[18:03:33] <CuriosTiger> but I do want to do a bit of spring cleaning
[18:03:42] <CuriosTiger> and transferring two-factor auth apps CAN be a pain
[18:03:45] <pussipupu> It's a shame there aren't really any less terrible solutions for mobiles
[18:04:03] <CuriosTiger> and of course, transferring the number is ALWAYS a pain -- not because of the technology, but because it means dealing with customer service at my cell carrier.
[18:05:19] <CuriosTiger> Eh, the solutions aren't terrible.
[18:05:29] <CuriosTiger> they have drawback, but they serve the needs of most people, most of the time.
[18:07:06] <pussipupu> Android is terrible and Apple wouldn't even let me use Emacs, so...
[18:07:07] <pussipupu> one man's meat 
[18:08:15] <CuriosTiger> If you require Emacs on your phone, I submit that you are not most people. :)
[18:09:43] <pussipupu> what are you transferring the number between though?
[18:09:43] <pussipupu> Don't you just move the SIM?
[18:10:06] <CuriosTiger> I'd like to use the eSIM capability
[18:10:19] <CuriosTiger> but in reality, yea, I'll probably just move the SIM to avoid talking to T-Mobile.
[18:10:39] <CuriosTiger> That's what I did last time, which is why I still have a physical SIM.
[18:15:04] <pussipupu> I don't know what an eSIM is but fair enough :p

[18:17:23] <jonix> Please help me find a correct word in the space below...
[18:17:54] <jonix> "Our TV Telecast is _______ on Sunday morning at 7:30PM in NBC"
[18:18:10] <jonix> displayed? shown?
[18:19:31] <StayHungry> aired
[18:20:01] <jonix> thanks StayHungry 
[18:21:27] <furrykef> I'd suggest "airs" is slightly better than "is aired"

[18:45:25] <alguien> So basically in English you can't say "Duration of calls" without "of", because "Calls duration" (plural calls) is incorrect, and "Call duration" (singular call) sounds like it's referring to a just one call. It's either have "of", or prepend "total": "Total call duration". Please confirm
[18:46:15] <CuriosTiger> "total call duration" still sounds like it refers to the duration of a single call.
[18:47:14] <CuriosTiger> But yes, total calls duration does not work in English, as we generally don't pluralize adjectives in English. You would say six green shirts, not *"sixes greens shirts".
[18:47:15] <pussipupu> "call durations" would be fine, and given the context would strongly suggest multiple calls
[18:47:42] <CuriosTiger> Call durations would work, as that would make "durations" the noun.
[18:47:49] <pussipupu> also "calls' durations" works
[18:48:07] <CuriosTiger> Right, you can make it a possessive. But that sounds a little clunky to my ears.
[18:48:08] <pussipupu> genetive often replaces "of"
[18:49:11] <CuriosTiger> That is true. But it doesn't always flow better.
[18:49:18] <CuriosTiger> Also, *genitive
[18:49:42] <CuriosTiger> s/*g/g/
[18:49:48] <CuriosTiger> s/\*g/g/
[18:49:49] <chat> CuriosTiger meant to say: Also, genitive
[18:49:58] <pussipupu> Fair, the perils of phone typing whilst wrestling apex predators
[18:50:27] <CuriosTiger> I hate typing on my phone for that exact reason. :-)

[19:01:12] <alguien> IMHO your suggestions would describe multiple individual call durations, unaggregated. What I need is something that describes their sum total.
[19:02:36] *** Joins: terrorjack (~terrorjac@ec2-35-181-134-114.eu-west-3.compute.amazonaws.com)
[19:02:36] <alguien> I don't suppose "calls' duration" (singular duration) would work.
[19:03:57] <CuriosTiger> "Aggregated duration of calls" would, however.
[19:04:20] <CuriosTiger> Even "Aggregated call duration" would work, since the word "aggregated" negates the implication of only one call.

[22:46:42] <cthulchu> so true
[22:47:14] <CuriosTiger> :-)
[22:47:57] <CuriosTiger> more generally, I can't think of a word that sums up both concepts in a single word. I'd probably suggest the straightforward adjective "burdensome", but that doesn't convey obsolescence
[22:52:09] *** Quits: Nimue (sid194105@id-194105.uxbridge.irccloud.com) ()
[22:52:25] <StayHungry> cthulchu: privet :)
[22:54:30] <cthulchu> so my context is...
[22:55:44] <cthulchu> we're doing development for a client. The client hired this new third party agency that does the testing. And they find my bugs. I'm making a point to implement our internal automated regression testing so that this testing company would become... Obsolete?
[22:55:59] <cthulchu> obsolete works here, but it seems rather weak
[22:56:10] <cthulchu> anyhow, I'm good with obsolete, just wanted something more precise
[22:56:22] <cthulchu> I'm sure there is something, I just can't find it
[22:57:08] <CuriosTiger> "burdensome and obsolete"
[22:57:12] <cthulchu> yeah
[22:57:23] <CuriosTiger> Sometimes, when you need to describe multiple qualities, you simply have to resort to multiple adjectives.
[22:57:34] <cthulchu> not that elegant
[22:58:30] <CuriosTiger> In the context you offered, I would rephrase slightly, focusing not on the burden of dealing with the external provider, but the cost.
[22:59:02] <cthulchu> yep, I don't mind focusing on cost
[22:59:05] <CuriosTiger> "Developing our own internal regression testing would eliminate both the need and the cost of contracting with an external provider."
[22:59:08] <CuriosTiger> something like that.
[22:59:25] <cthulchu> right, but we would hide it
[22:59:35] <cthulchu> do it internally so that the external provider would not find anything
[22:59:50] <StayHungry> cthulchu: try 'vestigial'
[23:00:13] <cthulchu> huh
[23:00:51] <cthulchu> ok, no, that's too obscure
[23:00:53] <CuriosTiger> "vestigial" is a near-synonym for "obsolete" in the sense of something that was useful in the past but isn't anymore.
[23:01:00] <cthulchu> yes
[23:01:09] <CuriosTiger> but it's usually used in the context of evolution, ie. an organ that has ceased to serve an important function
[23:04:04] <StayHungry> vestigial -> once there, but vanishing, e.g. vestigial radiation, vestigial signs of horse-drawn transport, vestigial guilt of the Germans, etc
[23:05:29] <huf> eh, that's the common usage
[23:05:39] <huf> but I think in evolution, vestigial doesnt necessarily mean it's useless
[23:05:48] <huf> just that it's used for something other than what it originally evolved for
