[21:22:38] <Arya[m]> seems you are using wpa supplicant
[21:22:46] <Arya[m]> networkmanager or wpa
[21:25:41] <D[m]123> accha
[21:26:07] <Arya[m]> networkmanager is way easier to use
[21:26:49] <D[m]123> ok
[22:11:53] *** Quits: bugswriter (~bugs@2405:201:6802:3168:388d:e5fc:1672:ee5f) (Quit: zzz)
[22:30:13] <pystardust> Arya[m]: wpa is used by networkmanager
[22:32:31] <pystardust> D[m]123: if ur using arch based then try installing networkmanager and enabling it, or u can read up how to set up netctl https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/netctl
[22:35:22] <pystardust> ur network interface should be followed after @, in this case it seems to be Vermilion, It should be something like netctl-auto@wlp4s0.service acording to the wiki, where wlp4s0 is the wifi interface (use `ip link`) to find it out
