[00:01:18] <AMcBain> If you always want it at the bottom of the viewport, with only one exception, you want to use position: fixed;
[00:01:33] <AMcBain> It won't scroll with the page though if you do that. It'll stay there regardless of scrolling.

[04:40:23] <ross> hi all. is there a way to make a child element the same size as its parent, even if that parent overflows outside of its viewport? I want the child to be the same size as the parent including its overflow, but position:absolute;width:100%;height:100% just makes it the same size as the parent viewport
[04:41:39] *** Joins: stenno (~stenno@user/stenno)
[04:43:42] <entuland> position absolute will not refer to the parent if the parent unless you set the parent itself to be absolute / relative or the alike
[04:43:53] <ross> yes, the parent is relative in this case
[04:44:11] <entuland> then it should work, can you share the non-working example?
[04:45:09] <ross> sure. will send 2 screenshots and then code
[04:45:30] <ross> first screenshot is the child element (svg) being the same height and width as its parent (div.canvas)
[04:45:34] <ross> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/FM8629N5/image.png
[04:46:02] <ross> 2nd is that same element except the div.canvas is scrolled slightly down and right
[04:46:04] <ross> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/7otvY1Kw/image.png
[04:46:19] <ross> I want the svg to cover the whole overflow area and scroll with div.canvas

[04:46:45] <entuland> something else must be wrong there, cause the technique works: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/zeg12dy9/
[04:47:59] <ross> https://bpa.st/QCOA
[04:48:17] <ross> hmmm. interesting
[04:48:43] <entuland> it's not easy to help you find out the culprit in such a complex scenario without a live sample

[04:49:37] <ross> it's true, but I appreciate the time anyway
[04:49:42] <entuland> yw
[04:55:00] <ross> ah! I think I see the difference - your .large is the same role as my .canvas. but your .large isn't the element that overflows, in your example that's html - in mine it is .canvas that is both big and overflowing
[04:56:10] <ross> so I could probably fix my issue by extracting one of those properties to another element
[04:59:13] <entuland> indeed, your overflow: scroll; is likely what's causing the issue there
[04:59:29] <entuland> cause the canvas per se would be smaller than its contents, and you care about its contents
[04:59:36] <entuland> so you need an additional wrapper of some sort
[05:01:59] <ross> yes, I think you are right
[05:02:50] <ross> I also think part of my issue is that there are no elements inside the canvas that are not absolutely positioned - I think I need to apply a height and width inline style from the same data that generates the positions of each element in it
[05:03:31] <ross> in fact I am not sure why it has any height and width at all, beyond filling the bottom half of the screen as I've instructed elsewhere

[05:12:42] <entuland> you could keep all of what you have and avoid setting the scroll on the canvas at all
[05:12:46] <entuland> which I think would be better
[05:13:00] <entuland> consider your canvas full size all the time, don't let it scroll
[05:13:13] <entuland> put it into a div and let the _parent_ of the canvas scroll if needed
[05:13:38] <ross> I would still want to be able to see the information at the top of the page regardless of the canvas' scroll position, though
[05:14:00] <ross> ah, sorry, I misunderstood
[05:14:03] <entuland> that's okay
[05:15:38] <entuland> what really matters is really just making sure that you have something stable to rely on

[10:17:29] <oksushi> rindolf: did you try it?
[10:17:58] <oksushi> if you’re asking how the page should know how high the iframe should be, CSS can’t do that unfortunately
[10:39:18] <wallbroken> oksushi: hello
[10:39:19] <wallbroken> https://jsfiddle.net/9g52kbnr/
[10:39:27] <wallbroken> i've added the "sold out" overlay
[10:39:31] <wallbroken> it works quit well
[10:39:33] <wallbroken> but i have a problem
[10:39:49] <wallbroken> when you click on "details" the popup opens on the right of the item
[10:40:09] <wallbroken> before adding the "sold out" it was opening right alignet to the "detauls" button
[10:41:29] <oksushi> give it a value for right or left
[10:41:57] <oksushi> wallbroken: here is the model class with a background colour https://www.dropbox.com/s/b2i5s8ciucj5jse/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-27%20at%204.11.39%20pm.png?dl=0
[10:42:21] <oksushi> without a right or left value, the popup doesn’t sit inside this purple box
[10:42:44] <wallbroken> oksushi: but why, before adding "sold out" it was showing right?
[10:43:02] <wallbroken> what did i do with "sold out" that broken the right view?
[10:43:14] <wallbroken> do you want to see the code before sold out adding?
[10:43:29] <oksushi> I have no context, but I’m guessing luck
[10:43:31] <oksushi> not really

[10:45:10] <wallbroken> oksushi: please, help me if you can.
[10:45:41] <oksushi> why not just apply the fix I told you? Whatever was happening before was by fluke, not by design

[11:23:45] <ldlework> Can anyone help me understand why the codeblocks on this page prevent the page from properly reducing in width when it approaches very skinny sizes? http://logos.ldlework.com:8000/docs/how-to-use
[11:29:32] <oksushi> ldlework: I’d guess that the inline styles of white-space: pre; and the width: 100%; on the <pre>s
[11:30:20] <wallbroken> oksushi: why you stopped ansering?
[11:30:48] <oksushi> ldlework: I’d probably add flex-wrap: wrap; to .css-k008qs as well
[11:30:54] <oksushi> that’s the parent flex container
[11:32:16] <oksushi> wallbroken: there is no question to answer
[11:33:39] <wallbroken> oksushi: there's still a problem to solve
[11:33:53] <ldlework> none of that seemed to work unfortunately
[11:34:24] <oksushi> I don’t see the changes reflected on your link ldlework
[11:35:30] <oksushi> ldlework: this is also a great example of why thinking about design “mobile first” pre-emptively solves a bunch of problems
[11:36:33] <wallbroken> i wan to see the modal under the detail button
[11:36:35] <wallbroken> https://jsfiddle.net/9g52kbnr/
[11:36:37] <ldlework> well this is a thirdparty component
[11:36:39] <wallbroken> how to make this?
[11:37:39] <oksushi> wallbroken: step 1) position .modal where you want the modal window to spawn from 2) position the modal within .modal by using a left or right property
[11:38:06] <wallbroken> oksushi:  but the question is:
[11:38:20] <wallbroken> what i did to break it?
[11:38:42] <oksushi> determine what you changed in the code, wallbroken
[11:38:43] <ldlework> I removed the width:100% and added flex-wrap, but the whitespace is built into the third-party component
[11:38:43] <wallbroken> i don't want left/right property
[11:38:53] <ldlework> deleting it from the inspector doesn't fix it though
[11:39:17] <ldlework> those codeblocks are determined to be their size
[11:40:59] <wallbroken> oksushi:
[11:41:01] <wallbroken> https://www.diffchecker.com/6TfDWOG5
[11:41:47] <oksushi> ldlework: this scoped CSS makes it a little tricky, but in essence, you need to override the white-space and width settings that are getting added and come natively with the <pre> element
[11:42:27] <oksushi> wallbroken: I showed you how to highlight the .modal class so you can see how it sits differently between the pages. What steps did you take after I highlighted that to you?
[11:44:19] <wallbroken> oksushi: you shown me just a dropbox link
[11:44:20] <wallbroken> right?
[11:44:31] <oksushi> two of them, that were screenshots
[11:44:58] <wallbroken> oksushi: i didn't get what you done honestrly
[11:45:28] <oksushi> I added .modal {padding: 1em; background: rebeccapurple;}
[11:45:34] <oksushi> to highlight to you where .modal was positioned on the page
[11:46:05] <ldlework> oksushi, I feel like the <code> should have the whitespace that it has, so it retains formatting, but the <pre> should get smaller, and its overflow should kick in
[11:46:24] <ldlework> it seems like the rigid width of the <code> is somehow preventing the <pre> from getting skinnier
[11:46:35] <wallbroken> oksushi: ok
[11:46:42] <ldlework> if you manually set the width on the <pre> to some small pixel amount, the overflow kicks in, and the scrollbar shows, etc
[11:47:00] <wallbroken> and in the items where i added "sold out" i see it on the right of the buttons
[11:47:58] <wallbroken> well, honestly also in the other one it is not in the position it should be
[11:50:11] <oksushi> ldlework: .css-k008qs {flex-wrap: wrap;} .styles-module--docLayout--1ZhUe .styles-module--content--2ME4h {max-width: 100%;}
[11:50:22] <oksushi> that would do the trick if you want them to scroll
[11:50:44] <oksushi> ldlework: gives me a result like this https://www.dropbox.com/s/2jsliedtn6hkg2p/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-27%20at%205.20.33%20pm.png?dl=0
[11:51:07] <ldlework> that looks like they are wrapping instead of scrolling
[11:52:20] <oksushi> you need to delete * {word-wrap: break-word;}
[11:52:38] <oksushi> i.e. this line https://www.dropbox.com/s/ysec3kj6rfbwjaz/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-27%20at%205.22.27%20pm.png?dl=0
[11:53:09] <ldlework> I think it's the sidebar
[11:53:17] <ldlework> the left sidebar is affecting the calculations
[11:53:24] <ldlework> if you refresh, then just delete the left sidebar from dom
[11:53:29] <ldlework> then it appears to be working

[18:39:06] <hassoon> wallbroken: resize the result area to see how it behaves with different screen size too*

[18:39:20] <wallbroken> i want to understand
[18:39:22] <hassoon> explain what
[18:39:26] <wallbroken> what you did
[18:39:55] <hassoon> wallbroken: read the css code and observe how it affects the DOM in the devtools
[18:41:00] <hassoon> wallbroken: and read about the css prooerties that i used in mdn's docs website @ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS
[18:42:04] <wallbroken> hassoon: unfortunately your code broken something
[18:42:10] <wallbroken> try to reduce the window resolution
[18:42:18] <wallbroken> to fit a mobile phone resolution
[18:42:24] <wallbroken> and then expand the dropdown
[18:42:25] <hassoon> wallbroken: and ?
[18:42:35] <wallbroken> you will see the "welcome ccc" in a random position
[18:43:53] <hassoon> wallbroken: https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/306
[18:45:06] <wallbroken> hassoon: good, but why is vertical?

[20:14:28] <hassoon> 08:39 < wallbroken> you see in the top bar "welcome ccc" ?
[20:14:28] <hassoon> 08:39 < wallbroken> i want to put it vertically aligned and also on the right of the nav bar
[20:14:47] <wallbroken> vertically aligned doesn't mean vertical
[20:14:55] <hassoon> wallbroken: it does
[20:15:10] <wallbroken> vertically aligned means that the text is in the center
[20:15:16] <hassoon> wallbroken: otherwise, learn to express yourself in english
[20:15:45] <hassoon> wallbroken: in that case, you should say, vertically centered
