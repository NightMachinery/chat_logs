[00:22:18] <adiabatic> who was ON TWITTER?

[03:28:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is there any way to have a special ssh config *just* for git
[03:28:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is that possible at all
[03:28:29] <Betawolf> I think you can have per-site configs
[03:28:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's good too I gues
[03:28:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wait no it's not
[03:28:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> I already have it per-site

[03:29:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> God only knows why
[03:30:18] <Betawolf> wait, so changing the config options for this git repo breaks ssh for some other host? That's odd.
[03:31:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well it's not "for this git repo"
[03:31:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's an ssh config file entry, for this host
[03:31:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Having it there, breaks my ftp client for all hosts, period
[03:32:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> I guess it tries to read the config file and ... ????
[03:32:45] <Betawolf> That seems like it would be bug in the ftp client? 
[03:33:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, yes, but I can't fix a bug in my ftp client
[03:33:28] <saturn2> you should be able to change core.sshCommand in your git config to 'ssh -o HostkeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa -o PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa' or so

[03:34:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is that possible

[03:46:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah I don't understand this "incorrect signature type" thing. I don't get that error from the *other* server that I need to downgrade to RSA with
[03:47:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> "If your connection negotiates an RSA key with a SHA-2 signature, but the OpenSSH agent you're using returns a SHA-1 signature (or, in some bizarre case I've never seen, a signature with the other SHA-2 algorithm), then you'll get this message. Usually the server will let you continue the connection, but you're using a weaker algorithm, so you'll want to fix it.
[03:47:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> If you're using a different program than your OpenSSH version's ssh-agent process, then you'll want to upgrade it to a fixed version that knows about SHA-2 RSA signatures. Alternatively, you can just switch to using OpenSSH's ssh-agent." ... this explains nothing
[03:48:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> (What ssh agent am I using? How do I tell??)
[03:48:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> (I assume I'm using the one that comes with openssh...)

[05:35:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Still amazing how some people manage to cling to naivete even while writing an article all about their cynical take

[05:36:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> What we "enjoyed" was a media that was able to maintain a plausible illusion of truth and accuracy
[05:36:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's the illusion that has shattered, not the reality...
[05:36:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: Thanks :)
[05:37:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> My mother tells of a coworker she had, many years ago... older woman. American. Jewish. Upper Manhattan upper crust, worked as a teacher (teaching English to immigrants, same as my mother) just to have something to do
[05:38:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, this woman read one and only one news source: the New York Times
[05:38:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> She would say: "If it's not in the New York Times, it did not happen!"
[05:39:16] <Betawolf> I wonder what Ukrainians make of that.
[05:39:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> When my mother told me this, my reply was: I can't help but wonder what this woman would say if reminded that *the fucking Holocaust* was not in the New York Times (stories about it were deliberately buried)

The prestigious mainstream media institutions are on a long, slow decline into irrelevance. Forevermore, news will become less and less relevant.

[05:43:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Note that the said website - Wesearchr - is, today, gone. Shocking, eh? And I bet you've never heard of it either)
[05:45:31] <PapuaHardyNet> I mean, I already do that in some ways. .kuudes for COVID info, almost everyone here for political news, .gwern for ML stuff, .MIRI for AI alignment news... hmm. I guess I ignore the rest

[05:46:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: You are in a select group, I guess...
[05:46:52] <PapuaHardyNet> how was wesearchr
[05:47:22] <saturn2> it was a silly idea thought up by silly people
[06:01:34] <PapuaHardyNet> this may sound dumb but I am simply thinking out loud: what if an AI model is incentivized to, as much as possible, avoid coordination failures and maximize everyone's goals, all while making the trade-offs necessary?
[06:02:36] <PapuaHardyNet> This implicitly requires that the AI model would model the humans and their preferences, and the tendency for humans' preferences to change, and the interaction between the humans and the result
[06:02:53] <PapuaHardyNet> basically what we have with self-driving cars, except scaled up 1000x

[06:08:52] <PapuaHardyNet> there's a specific kind of writing that Yudkowsky has inspired the rationalist community to use: one where you implicitly describe a concept using A Term with a Capital First Letter and then continue to mention it using that term. It encourages confusion in my opinion.
[06:09:27] <enterprisey> re the tlmc link, I'm certain I've seen the handle rwx around in places but I forget
[06:10:14] <enterprisey> yud writing is funny. if I had more command over words I'd write a little something that points out characteristics of the style
[06:12:06] <PapuaHardyNet> I read so much Yud as a teen and thought I'm just low IQ for not being able to crystallize what he says into easy to communicate terms. Now I disagree, I genuinely feel that Yud did the world a dis-service by not paying closer attention to the names he pinned to concepts.
[06:12:54] <PapuaHardyNet> "Use the Try Harder, Luke" is not a good term to describe what he intended to say in the essay. It obscures, it forces the person to have read the essay, it functions as a filter so that rats can only be understood by other rats
[06:14:39] <PapuaHardyNet> "belief in belief" is nice, "paperclips" was a good meme. But yeah, pinning concepts to titles of essays wasn't a very good idea. It kind of reminds me of moldbug in some ways. Except Yud is much more readable than moldbug
[06:19:08] <PapuaHardyNet> "The ability to productively rewrite software and the ability to perfectly extrapolate humanity's True Preferences are two different skills." here's a good example. Why did Rob Bensinger write "True Preferences" with capitalized first letters? "true preferences" would be acceptable, and is a common economic concept.
[06:21:34] <enterprisey> the last moldbug I read was maybe the one about circling, and I didn't know it was him
[06:21:53] <enterprisey> I read the whole thing and enjoyed it, then clicked back to themotte and everyone was screeching
[06:21:57] <enterprisey> maybe I'm fucked in the head

[06:23:48] <PapuaHardyNet> enterprisey: can you explain what circling is in less than 100k words, I don't feel interested in reading moldbug today but I want to understand what made you feel this way
[06:24:48] <enterprisey> been a while, and actually I never read a description of what it actually was
[06:24:52] <PapuaHardyNet> lmao
[06:25:08] <enterprisey> maybe something about deeply talking with other people in a circle...?
[06:25:20] <enterprisey> these days I filter what I read a hell of a lot more
[06:25:21] <PapuaHardyNet> this is exactly what I mean. Here's the first article I find about circling by moldbug, and there's no clear definition *in the section titled Circling, with the first mention of it!* https://graymirror.substack.com/p/circling-and-nerd-society
[06:25:22] <Robomot> "Circling" and nerd society - by Curtis Yarvin ("Dreams don't work unless you do.")
[06:26:41] <PapuaHardyNet> btw, I have a very, very helpful standard for what I read these days: Can I make flashcards of what I read? If yes, then the arguments and the reasoning are clear enough for it to be worth reading. Else, ehhh
[06:27:23] <PapuaHardyNet> no seriously, this has been a gigantic benefit and has helped me avoid insight porn like ribbonfarm and other rat-adj bloggers
[06:28:04] <PapuaHardyNet> note-taking as a standard doesn't help, it is easy for me to write notes that are about as stupid as what I read. With flashcards, I *need* to atomize the argument, break things down as much as possible.
[06:28:28] <PapuaHardyNet> you can't have a flashcard with a question "What does 'circling' mean?" with a stupid non-answer if you want to be able to review it in an year from now

[06:40:51] <PapuaHardyNet> look at this. They introduce a term, give a definition in the very first line, and provide some context for readers to connect the term to familiar concepts
[06:42:32] <enterprisey> ah (alt-tabbed away). jacob collier is all sizzle, no steak. some rat writing is the same way
[06:42:34] <PapuaHardyNet> although the idea of "specification gaming" is very much rooted in the assumption that an incompletely defined objective should be enough for an AI to discover our intended objective, which is not very smart, imo
[06:43:09] <PapuaHardyNet> right
[06:43:13] <enterprisey> but not just all sizzle, no steak, it's lush and very impressive from a technique standpoint, but there's no feeling or emotion or depth

[09:40:36] <enterprisey> tom wolfe wrote the right stuff, which is my favorite nonfiction book of all time
[09:40:42] <quanticle> Oh, TIL
[09:41:31] <quanticle> Caro is cool. He manages to find the way around the true-but-boring problem by hyperfocusing on one person
[09:41:41] <quanticle> But the price you pay there is generality
[09:42:03] <quanticle> You learn a lot about Lyndon Johnson or Robert Moses, but does what you learn apply more broadly? Caro is silent on the matter.
[09:42:05] <enterprisey> oh it's pretty damn general
[09:42:05] <PapuaHardyNet> I've read robert caro. while it was very interesting, I can't condense it into easy to communicate insights. Is it still worth reading? Perhaps reading history and biographies such as caro implicitly (rather than explicitly) teaches you things that may be useful, but without reflection, they are not very useful
[09:42:50] <enterprisey> on the numbers, the things you learn about robert moses are greatly outweighed by the things you learn about NYC, america, or power
[09:43:00] <quanticle> Fair enough
[09:43:00] <PapuaHardyNet> basically, you are given raw experiences by such narratives. what you do with them, or how useful they are to you, is up to you
[09:43:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> What you learn is that NYC is awesome and Robert Moses helped make it that way
[09:43:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's broadly applicable
[09:43:30] <quanticle> lol
[09:43:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Everyone should know it!
[09:43:58] <enterprisey> I might disagree with some of that, but let's shelve that undoubtedly interesting debate for later
[09:44:04] <PapuaHardyNet> I still haven't finished The Power Broker. maybe I should
[09:44:43] <enterprisey> yes, you should finish the power broker
[09:44:51] <enterprisey> you can skip whatever you want, but at least get to the end
[09:45:13] <enterprisey> back to nonfiction, I would rather have one david foster wallace book than ten books filled with dry facts
[09:45:51] <enterprisey> real nonfiction could not be further away from pop nonfiction

[09:49:32] <enterprisey> probably many others, I'm a bloody dilettante
[09:49:42] <enterprisey> those are just the ones I feel able to personally recommend
[09:50:05] <quanticle> But is what they write true?
[09:51:04] <quanticle> Like, let's take Gibbons, for example. He's a *great* writer. An absolute master of the English language.
[09:51:13] <enterprisey> lots of ways I could answer that... but I'll stick to "yes"
[09:51:16] <quanticle> But was his thesis about the decline and fall of the Roman Empire true?
[09:51:20] <quanticle> Eh... kinda not really
[09:51:26] <enterprisey> again, read the article, or at least the first couple of screenfuls
[09:52:09] <enterprisey> gibbon lived in the 18th century, they didn't know jack shit in the 18th century

[19:48:03] <PapuaHardyNet> gurkenglas: I've become a convert to the primacy of being able to model computable functions in math
[19:49:49] <PapuaHardyNet> while writing code is a good test of ensuring computability of your problem and your solution, it definitely obscures your understanding, and introduces a huge delay in the feedback loop
[19:51:43] <PapuaHardyNet> pseudocode is better, although you lose some testability. But if you are going down the pseudocode route to maximize your own ability to ensure you understand the problem, and its computability, math seems like the final frontier, with its compressed representations of concepts and formal definitions of everything
[19:53:49] <PapuaHardyNet> the practical implication of this seems to be that I should be able to describe whatever I am doing, when it comes to the code I write for a neural network, using math. does this conclusion make sense or do you think some caveats apply (or it is incorrect entirely)?
[20:03:43] <PapuaHardyNet> come to think of it, pseudocode is still probably better for certain problems, over math. I'm unsure which ones - distributed systems perhaps.

[21:03:27] <PapuaHardyNet> "Crucially, every component of the architecture is differentiable, making it straightfor- ward to train with gradient descent. We achieved this by defining ‚Äòblurry‚Äô read and write operations that interact to a greater or lesser degree with all the elements in memory (rather than addressing a single element, as in a normal Turing machine or digital computer).
[21:03:53] <PapuaHardyNet> The degree of blurriness is determined by an attentional ‚Äúfocus‚Äù mechanism that constrains each read and write operation to interact with a small portion of the memory, while ignoring the rest. Because interaction with the memory is highly sparse, the NTM is biased towards storing data without interference." neural turing machines are interesting

[22:47:13] <PapuaHardyNet> turing mahcines cannot model themselves and we know this because of the halting problem
[22:47:51] <PapuaHardyNet> because turing machines cannot model themselves, and AIXI is basically an ensemble of an infinite amount of Turing machines, AIXI cannot model itself
[22:49:00] <PapuaHardyNet> therefore AIXI will not be able to reason correctly about actions that can hurt or improve its machinery - which is one of the main conditions for a superintelligent AI, in my opinion, ensuring its own survival and being able to self-improve
