[00:48:39] <sachac> I'm happy to take captions from whatever tool people want to use to make them. If people don't have subed.el set up, they may find it easier to use Wikimedia's web-based subtitling tool or another program. I like the way Emacs lets me split and correct subtitles easily. Still, it's good to have options, and we have a bunch of Q&A videos people can try it on.
[00:49:29] <zaeph> Yeah; and we can probably keep track of the efforts being done over there to avoid duplication of work.
[00:50:22] <sachac> rdrg109: if you'd like to figure out a good workflow for coordinating, that would be great :)
[01:17:22] <sachac> rdrg109: Alternatively, I can take a look at it tonight and see where it might fit in.
[01:29:36] <rdrg109> zaeph: That would be ideal
[01:29:48] <rdrg109> sachac: I'm active at IRC/Telegram and in mail from times to times

[01:32:56] <sachac> rdrg109: Is the Wikimedia Commons subtitle editing experience basically this textbox that wants SRT?
[01:33:08] <sachac> or am I missing something?
[01:35:30] <sachac> There was another community captioning site somewhere...
[01:36:36] <sachac> Amara, I think? 
[01:37:16] <rdrg109> sachac: Yes, the textbox is all there is. It's rudimentary, but I think they hope users edit the subtitles somewhere else and just paste it there.
[01:37:27] <rdrg109> sachac: You can find some more information on subttiles here https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Timed_Text
[01:38:35] <rdrg109> I'll ask to confirm this
[01:44:03] <sachac> hmm. not sure it buys us much, but we can use it as a backup/extra distribution channel
[01:46:05] <rdrg109> sachac: The textbox is all there is. I know, it is not useful in this sense.
[01:50:19] <rdrg109> Let me ask if there's some user-friendly way to add/edit subtitles
[01:50:49] <rdrg109> straight in Wikimedia Commons
[01:52:33] <sachac> maybe Amara
[01:53:27] <sachac> but it might not pass some people's philosophical requirements
[01:53:42] <sachac> so it can't be the central place for coordination
[01:54:51] <sachac> ugh
[01:55:25] <sachac> I'd be more inclined to get everyone trained up on subed, and then wait for bandali to figure out CGI for ikiwiki for web-based editing in case people can't ssh
[01:56:26] <zaeph> I agree.
[02:04:19] <rdrg109> Ok, they told me that there's no out-of-the-box feature for editing subtitles yet, so we can leave this point out
[02:04:40] <rdrg109> Maybe, as sachac said, we could upload them as a backup/extra distribution channel and for people that are curious exploring Wikimedia projects using structured data
[02:04:44] <sachac> on the plus side, it's likely to be possible to get Emacs to post subtitles to Wikimedia Commons
[02:05:27] <sachac> as there's a mediawiki.el (of course)
[02:09:24] <sachac> also, slightly annoyingly, they don't take the captions baked into the webm, so whoever is going to upload the files will need to use ffmpeg to extract the subtitles into srt in addition to filling out the form with a number of required fields.
[02:10:20] <sachac> If we decide to use them as backup/distribution and if they're okay with our files, I can try to see about semi-automation.
[02:21:24] <rdrg109> sachac: The talks are educational media and CC-BY-SA-4.0, they folllow the main guideline "Wikimedia Commons is a media file repository making available public domain and freely licensed educational media content" (retrieved from https://w.wiki/azV ), so I think we can upload them
[02:23:01] <rdrg109> Btw, with structured data I mean users of WC could find those videos by asking questions of the style "Talks in conferences of an open source software that discuss about Perso-Arabic" or "Talks where the main subject is parsers and Python". This can be done by using the SPARQL Wikimedia Commons Query Service ( https://w.wiki/4Yaa )
[02:24:07] <rdrg109> If you wish, I'm still willing to devote some time to help in uploading/add metadata to the videos
[02:25:01] <sachac> rdrg109: I think metadata might be handy.
[02:25:28] <sachac> I'd been meaning to cross-link things like all the philosophy talks, or the Org talks, or stuff like that
[02:28:14] <sachac> rdrg109: feel free to make all sorts of trails
[02:28:26] <sachac> or tags or categories or whatever
[02:29:36] <sachac> (although sometimes it's easier to do that later on, as part of the search process, to minimize YAGNI)
[02:51:55] <rdrg109> sachac: Ok, I will consider that!
[02:52:59] <rdrg109> Let me know if you need help with uploading the videos
[02:56:40] <sachac> rdrg109: does wikimedia commons let you add metadata for off-site videos?
[02:57:17] <sachac> I'm sort of not too keen on the work of reuploading all the videos, especially since my screentime is quite limited these days :)
[02:57:47] <sachac> and I don't want you to be bottlenecked by the screentime limits of a house with a 5-year-old
[02:58:34] <sachac> you might also want to consider making maps/trails/tags on the emacsconf wiki itself, for easier discoverability
[02:58:50] <sachac> maybe starting with listing related talks

[03:08:04] <rdrg109> sachac: If we don't upload the videos, but still store metadata, we can create items in Wikidata and link to the recording with the property "full work available at URL" (see this https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q110090790 )
[03:08:55] <rdrg109> However, I still think that by uploading them some people will prefer to watch it straight from Wikimedia Commons, so I can take the charge of uploading them
[03:09:24] <rdrg109> We can then link the Wikidata item to the video at Wikimedia Commons
[03:10:05] <sachac> sure, let me send you the credentials for the emacsconf account I created
[03:11:39] <sachac> rdrg109: happy to let you do the work =)

[22:05:26] <rdrg109> [Q] Is there any way I can download all the public files of Emacsconf (i.e. .vtt, .webm)? I've tried this command => wget -r -l 0 -nc -A '*.vtt' -A '*.webm' https://media.emacsconf.org/2021/ <= but, there are some files that are missing. For example, the file "emacsconf-2021-omegat--emacs-manuals-translation-and-omegat--jean-christophe-helary--main_fr.vtt" is not downloaded.
[22:06:42] <zaeph> rdrg109: I believe sachac has set you up with credentials to access a place where we keep everything?
[22:07:14] <rdrg109> Not yet
[22:07:36] <sachac> those files are public anyway
[22:08:09] <zaeph> main_fr.vtt isn't listed as link on media. anyway.
[22:08:29] <sachac> The only extra subtitles are for that one, so you could download them manually
[22:08:30] <zaeph> Might have more luck from https://emacsconf.org/2021/talks/
[22:08:46] <sachac> and I'll update the index later. the index there doesn't include Q&A, anyway.
[22:08:59] <sachac> want to start with the main talks and captions?
[22:09:11] <zaeph> Getting all the *--main\.* stuff from 2021/talks should do it nicely.
[22:09:12] <rdrg109> Yes, they are. I can see the file in https://emacsconf.org/2021/talks/, but not in https://media.emacsconf.org/2021/ . I was wondering I'm missing some other files, and for this reason I asked for other method that ensures that I get all the files
[22:09:12] <sachac> I think bandali has public rsync on his todo list
