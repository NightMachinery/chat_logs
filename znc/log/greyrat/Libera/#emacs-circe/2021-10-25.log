[19:51:36] <n5hxr> it seems circe can only connect to 6667, not to 6697, even if I specify :tls t in my network options. It hangs at 'Connecting...'
[19:56:54] <bremner> n5hxr: circe can certainly connect to other ports and use TLS. I am typing this on such a connection
[19:58:48] <wasamasa> yup
[19:59:00] <wasamasa> make sure the port is specified correctly
[19:59:34] <bremner> I have tls-program configured as well. I don't know if that is needed anymore
[19:59:42] <wasamasa> depends on how old your emacs is
[19:59:53] <wasamasa> I've changed it to use in-process gnutls if possible
[20:00:13] <bremner> makes sense. I just have not changed the config that "works"
[20:00:39] <wasamasa> which is significantly faster and more robust than with a gnutls process
[20:19:28] <n5hxr> that might be the issue... I am running an old Emacs, though my circe install is pretty recent (20210717.1041)
[20:20:53] <n5hxr> I'll play with tls-program setting and see if I can make it work, thanks!
