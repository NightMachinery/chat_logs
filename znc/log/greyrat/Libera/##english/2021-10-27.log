Well I didn't look for this specific page, this is just also tells what I searched for: 'Stallman has made many posts sympathizing with efforts to legalize some forms of child pornography' https://geekfeminism.wikia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman

[01:32:59] <GuiToris> Linus Torvalds is not like him
[01:33:20] <blkshp> o.O
[01:33:23] <GuiToris> maybe that's why companies prefer to use Linux instead of GNU
[01:33:32] <GuiToris> I told you I didn't say nonsense
[01:33:42] <blkshp> Companies use Windows, companies back end uses linux lol
[01:33:44] <bin_vamp> GuiToris: what the heck are you talking about
[01:33:59] <bin_vamp> most servers use gnu/linux
[01:34:05] <bin_vamp> some use busybox/linux instead
[01:34:13] <blkshp> most servers*
[01:34:26] <bin_vamp> that's what I wrote
[01:34:28] <blkshp> 80% of ours are windows, we have 70000 users
[01:34:37] <GuiToris> blkshp, I meant Red Hat and companies like them. Stallman wrote them a letter to change their names to Red Hat GNU/Linux, but they refused it
[01:34:39] <blkshp> Who serve 65 million people :P
[01:35:07] <bin_vamp> Stallman is a nutjob, I don't think that's really an uncommon opinion

[01:35:31] <GuiToris> bin_vamp, blkshp mentioned that I shouldn't joke with things that are 'deeply inappropriate' I just wanted to show him that it seems to be less inappropriate for some people

[01:42:18] <GuiToris> did you use Win7 10 years ago?
[01:42:47] <GuiToris> I scrolled back to find out how long you've been using the panel like that
[01:43:05] <GuiToris> Just because, I didn't know it was possible in XP
[01:43:38] <blkshp> Win 7 came out in 2009
[01:44:39] <blkshp> But you could use it like that in XP but it didn't scale too well. I did use it a little in XP but mostly when vista / 7. I didn't use 7 that much because that was when i moved to linux distros and i had those on the same side, when i came back to 8, it naturally jsut went there.
[01:46:34] <GuiToris> it doesn't necessarily follow that you used Win 7 in 2009
[01:46:55] <GuiToris> 11 is out and you aren't using it
[01:49:45] <GuiToris> Someone is said that every other windows release is a garbage. 95! 98 Me! XP Vista! 7 8! 10 ?11?
[01:49:53] <blkshp> it's been out for 2 weeks! (and to be honest, i probably wasn't
[01:50:44] <GuiToris> -is
[01:50:49] <blkshp> 95 had 3 releases, 98 had 2 releases, vista had 2, 7 had 3 I believe, 8 was followed by 8.1, 10 has had 10 or more releases
[01:52:05] <GuiToris> what I heard is none of the vista releases were good so they had rather used XP
[01:52:36] <blkshp> ME! lasted about a day on my machine
[01:52:38] <GuiToris> and removing the Windows menu was a really-really bad idea -although I haven't seen it personally-
[01:52:41] <blkshp> then i went back to 98se
[01:53:01] <GuiToris> I liked WinMe because it had Windows Movie maker
[01:53:21] <GuiToris> I even remember the demo video, a kid was sliding on the slide
[01:53:27] <GuiToris> I think the slide was yellow
[01:53:40] <blkshp> I liked ME but only because sound could overlap
[01:54:02] <blkshp> I could be playing a CD and still have notifications.
[01:54:18] <GuiToris> you could have enjoyed it for a whole day :D
[01:54:48] <GuiToris> but I think I did get crazy error messages

[01:55:16] <GuiToris> hello
[01:55:19] <blkshp> Hello.
[01:55:27] * blkshp sets an example.
[01:55:46] <Beluga> I am looking for a word.
[01:55:46] <GuiToris> How I should capitalize and use punctuation marks?
[01:56:06] <blkshp> Beluga: potato?
[01:56:15] <Beluga> blkshp, yes, that'll do.  Thank you :)
[01:56:15] <mwsb> Good word
[01:56:22] <blkshp> Any time :D
[01:56:36] <Beluga> There is this software called "Digikam" on KDE.  It allows to tag pictures.
[01:56:49] <Beluga> okay, let me correct that.
[01:56:55] <Beluga> "It allows for pictures to be tagged"
[01:57:21] <Beluga> Now, the problem is:
[01:57:36] <Beluga> It is easy for me to put things in categories.  For example:
[01:57:49] <blkshp> Could you press enter less?
[01:57:57] <Beluga> @animals('bird', 'fish', 'mouse', 'cat');
[01:58:39] <Beluga> @food('pizza', 'noodles', 'vegetables',  'potatoes');
[01:59:15] <Beluga> What I am looking for now is an umbrella term that I can use to describe the action that is happening in the picture.
[01:59:59] <GuiToris> are you going to provide the picture?
[02:00:02] <blkshp> @action
[02:00:16] <Beluga> The category will contain things like:  "kissing", "laughing", "dancing",   (all verbs) but also situations like "breakup drama"  or  "getting an injection at the surgery"
[02:00:41] <Beluga> or "throwing a tantrum"
[02:01:12] <Beluga> blkshp, action is exactly what I had so far, but it sounded awkward to me.
[02:01:41] <GuiToris> it's not awkward if he said so!
[02:01:44] <blkshp> Sounds fine to me
[02:02:39] <Beluga> blkshp, would it make sense to split the verbs from the general mood and maybe have two categories?
[02:02:41] <Beluga> actions and mood?
[02:02:51] <Beluga> actions => kissing, dancing, laughing, eating, drinking, etc.
[02:03:02] <Beluga> mood => breakup drama,  being angry,  being upset, etc.
[02:03:06] <GuiToris> laughing -> kissing -> injury -> surgery  sounds like @cheating to me
[02:03:16] <blkshp> @content
[02:03:40] <Beluga> GuiToris, it was a wild rollercoaster ride, let's put it that way
[02:04:26] <Beluga> blkshp, so, only one category, and "content" rather than "action" then?

[02:27:05] <swarfega> irssi supports theming
[02:27:20] <bp99> I know
[02:27:37] <bp99> but since I moved to Matrix I need a Matrix client
[02:27:49] <swarfega> :o
[02:28:20] <bp99> And there are not many. There is gomuks, which is pretty good, but too new to have enough features I would want. There is also a weechat plugin, but I am not that fond of weechat.
[02:28:36] <LjL> the weechat plugin doesn't work very well either
[02:29:05] <bp99> Gomuks is really nice, just needs a bit of work
[02:31:28] <GuiToris> I don't like cli clients because they can't offer proper notifications
[02:32:44] <bp99> They should be able to, there is libnotify for example
[02:32:54] <bp99> I remember weechat had a notification plugin which worked adequately

[02:34:54] <bp99> Yeah, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve managed to set up notifications with irssi, but there may be a way, I don‚Äôt know

[02:37:44] <gry> i use openbsd too
[02:37:52] <gry> without bells though
[02:37:55] <gry> i don't like sounds
[02:38:13] <bp99> I also don‚Äôt have bells set
[02:38:19] <GuiToris> I know, I just surprised that it's not a widespread program, however, it looks cool indeed
[02:38:34] <bp99> but what I would want are libnotify notifications that dunst could show
[02:39:02] <bp99> I am actually not sure why they are not wokring since there is apparently a toggle in gomuks, which I have enabled and I also have dunst running
[02:39:35] <bp99> GuiToris: There is actually an OpenBSD port of it, I should try to get it added to the list

[02:47:02] <bp99> MetaNova: yes but I am not directly using an IRC client. I mean I bridge IRC to my Matrix homeserver. There has to be some kind of conversion between the formatting used by the IRC protocol and the one used by Matrix, mesupposes

[07:17:07] <mdogg> We did a 'secret Santa' at work one Christmas and my gift from the lady who pulled my name was a bible.  Kind of an odd to give a bible to somebody at work.  But what was even more strange was that she had highlighted every single word.
[07:26:02] <twb> mdogg: every word in the entire bible?
[07:26:19] <twb> all 7 scrolls?
[07:31:24] <twb> BTW I was referring to T. E. Lawrence, not the bible.

[07:47:13] <mdogg> Well, it wasn't every word individually, it was the entire text.  All of it.  Different colours for different things, though.  Was kind of creepy.  I donated it to the Goodwill with a bunch of other books.  I didn't want to have it.  I mean, I do have a bible but I picked it out myself.. heh
[07:49:53] <mdogg> Actually, about 15 years ago my mom said that she wanted to give me a bible for Christmas and asked me to figure out which one I'd like to have.  That's really not something you can just give to a colleague or an acquaintance.  lol
[07:51:17] <twb> I like the ones that have each century's interpretations written in a spiral outwards from the middle
[07:51:37] <twb> and the local translation on the other page

[13:07:44] <pabed> "as a network and system administrator"  is correct ?

[13:11:51] <blkshp> That's fine.
[13:12:35] <pabed> as a " x and y " is correct? 
[13:14:58] <blkshp> yes, because you are administering a network and a system. "Network and system administrator" is a job role. If you were a clown and a system administrator you'd say "I worked as a clown and a system administrator" (possibly using an oxford comma but it's not required in this instance because of the "a") You could also say "I worked as a clown, and system administrator" which makes sure not one thinks you administer clowns.

[22:17:12] <Jong> I don't understand the metaphor colorblind as used to mean to treat everyone equal.  Why not say I see that many people are all different but they should be treated identically under the law, it's like the person says I'll pretend we're all the same so we're treated identically under law.
[22:19:48] <Jong> One undertone express the view "must be the same to be treated the same".  The other the view "can be different but still treated the same".  
[22:20:53] <Jong> Imagine you are black and someone says "I'll pretend you are white so I treat you as well as I do white people."
[22:21:35] <Jong> How about stop the pretending, accept that I am black, and still treat me as well as you do white people?

[22:26:41] *** Joins: mei (~mei@user/mei)
[22:27:12] <placeb0> who's supposed to be colourblind the black persoj or the white person?
[22:28:55] <Jong> placeb0  most of the time it's a white person saying this to a black person, so it's likely the white person saying they will pretend the black person is white.
[22:28:57] <tinwhiskers> A colourblind person is someone who doesn't differentiate by skin colour. 
[22:29:15] <bp99> Jong: I understand your reasoning, but you can also look at it this way: I may be colourblind because I simply do not _care_ about, say, skin tone. It‚Äôs literally all the same to me. It does not necessarily have to mean that I want to pretend that the other person is like me. It just means that I see a human being and the fact that they are black, female, or handicapped do not change anything. Disclaimer: I have never seen or used this...
[22:29:21] <bp99> ... methaphor and do not necessarily share this mindset (although it sounds fine to me), I just wanted to reflect on your arguments.
[22:30:01] <placeb0> tinwhiskers: a colourblind person is someone who can't see certain colours, that has nothing to do with skin colour
[22:30:17] <placeb0> the colours they usually can't see are red and green
[22:30:26] <tinwhiskers> placeb0: dude. did you even read?
[22:30:37] <tinwhiskers> this is obviously not about actual colour blindness
[22:31:58] <placeb0> so how do you go on calling someone 'colourblind'?
[22:32:15] <tinwhiskers> usually it's something someone describes themselves as
[22:32:56] <placeb0> is it a racist thing?
[22:33:13] <tinwhiskers> It's kinda as awkward as saying "I'm not racist. I have black friends"
[22:33:35] <Jong> hahaha I never heard that before.
[22:33:51] <placeb0> I think I got confused with what Jong was saying
[22:34:15] <placeb0> "I'll pretend you are white so I treat you as well as I do white people."
[22:34:25] <Jong> I was basically asking why aren't people more aware in how what they say can be misunderstood by the recipient
[22:34:26] <placeb0> is thay an actual expression/metaphor used?
[22:35:23] <bp99> I don‚Äôt see how this can be understood in the way you said (what placeb0 just quoted). If you try hard enough, anything can be understood wrongly I suppose
[22:35:24] <Jong> placeb0  when someone says "I'm colorblind. I don't discriminate against black people", the person uses the word colorblind metaphorically
[22:36:35] <Jong> Apparently, the preference in the channel is to spell the word "colourblind" with a 'u' in the word.
[22:36:56] <tinwhiskers> Jong: depends on time of day as to whether more americans are awake or not
[22:38:35] <placeb0> are you guys saying that "I'll pretend you are white so I treat you as well as I do white people." and "I'm colourblind" are equal?
[22:39:09] <bp99> I think Jong suggests that the latter _can_ be understood as the former

[23:09:54] <placeb0> so is it considered a bad or a good thing?
[23:12:51] <great_taste> are you asking whether racism is bad? :P
[23:13:05] <fentanyl> What does "went on trail" mean?
[23:13:20] <fentanyl> *trial
[23:13:45] <fentanyl> Like, is this only be used in legal context?
[23:14:11] <fentanyl> Or can I also use that casually? Like, "Damn, my friend went on trial for kicking his teacher's ass"
[23:14:16] <fentanyl> Does that also works?
[23:15:54] <tinwhiskers> placeb0: it's intended to be neutral and demonstrate you are not racist but often comes across as something a racist person would say
[23:16:00] <fentanyl> I remember the usage of the word "trial" within a company.
[23:17:38] <bp99> .w trial
[23:17:41] <tinsoldier> trial ‚Äî Noun: 1. An opportunity to test something out; a test., 2. Appearance at judicial court in order to be examined., 3. A difficult or annoying experience., 4. A tryout to pick members of a team., ‚Äî Verb: 1. To carry out a series of tests on (a new product, procedure etc.) before marketing or implementing it., 2. To try out (a new player) in a s <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/trial>...
[23:18:00] <kurahaupo> fentanyl: A defendant would go on trial charged with a specific crime or offence, such as "Intentionally causing grievous bodily harm"
[23:18:36] <fentanyl> I see. so the phrase "went on trial" can be used for generic situations as well I guess.
[23:18:41] <kurahaupo> fentanyl: And that's after they've been arrested and charged
[23:19:11] <kurahaupo> "went" is the simple past tense of "go"
[23:19:48] <mdogg> I think it's fine to acknowledge that someone is black, or white, or Latino, or Asian.  What's most important is that people are given the same respect, understanding, and consideration regardless of their race.
[23:20:50] <kurahaupo> mdogg: Maybe. I think it's a slippery slope. And "race" is an extremely ill-defined notion
[23:21:24] <fentanyl> mdogg: Equating "diversity" with "race" or "skin color" is a poor mapping.
[23:21:41] <kurahaupo> fentanyl: agreed

[23:22:57] <fentanyl> what about some white guy in NJ who is paralyzed for his entire life but he's rejected on job because the "diversity" divion needs only a black guy?

[23:23:04] <fentanyl> that's just one example.
[23:23:26] <fentanyl> *job interview.
[23:23:46] <fentanyl> there are many considerations to "diversity"
[23:23:59] <fentanyl> than merely notable features like skin color
[23:24:30] <mdogg> If you're referring to affirmative action programs, I am opposed to them as well.  
[23:24:51] <kurahaupo> fentanyl: Skewing the results from job interviews to meet some statistical model of diversity is stupid. If you want more of a particular kind of person, then send your head hunters to find such people
[23:25:21] <kurahaupo> Offer scholarships so they can get training
[23:25:26] <mdogg> It could work the other way, too.  What if there wass a black guy who didn't get the job because even though he was more qualified, the company needed to hire a paraplegic.  
[23:26:17] <fentanyl> sad reality is, most companies' definition of "diversity" is skin color.
[23:26:36] <kurahaupo> fentanyl: that's a rather US-centric view
[23:26:52] <fentanyl> Here in Canada too
[23:27:43] <mdogg> Here in the US, the term "diversity" in business is beginning to include sexual orientation as well.  
[23:28:15] <LjL> oh lord
[23:28:17] <mdogg> Though there are an infinite number of factors that go in to creating a diverse community.
[23:28:30] <fentanyl> mdogg: Hehe, here it's more amplified.
[23:28:35] <fentanyl> *that's
[23:29:11] <fentanyl> The guy I worked with got his job becuse of his sexual orientation.
[23:29:25] <mdogg> You know that for a fact?
[23:29:49] <fentanyl> Yes, I've personally talked with the engineer who interviewd that person.
[23:29:58] <fentanyl> *interviewed
[23:30:02] <kurahaupo> diversity is both admirable as a social objective, and good sense for forward business planning, but pinning individual appointments is exactly the wrong way to go about it

[23:30:34] <mdogg> I would be miserable if I knew that I was hired not because of my qualifications, but because of something that is completely out of my control.
[23:30:38] <kurahaupo> (it's very bad social policy, and bad for forward planning)
[23:31:08] <mdogg> kurahaupo‚¶Ç Correct.
[23:31:22] <fentanyl> mdogg: There is another guy with much better points at various stages of interview (usually 4), but roughly speaking the person scored 10% lower than another guy. But his application was rejected due to diversity.
[23:31:55] <LjL> as a person with a uh non-majority sexual orientation, fuck that shit.
[23:32:04] <fentanyl> mdogg: Well, you're not allowed to disclose that information.
[23:32:20] <fentanyl> that'd be considered violation of the interviewer's policies.
[23:32:34] <mdogg> What if he was just more 'likable'?  
[23:32:38] <darsie> Are products alive before their end of life?
[23:32:56] <kurahaupo> no but their support activities are alive
[23:33:01] <mdogg> darsie‚¶Ç Can you give us an example of what you mean?
[23:33:02] <fentanyl> mdogg: likable?
[23:33:30] <fentanyl> you mean the points scored at behavioral interview stage?
[23:33:41] <darsie> mdogg: My Fairphone 1. Or: My table has gotten some marks in its life.
[23:33:47] <mdogg> fentanyl‚¶Ç Right - what if he just had a better attitude or the hiring manager just felt like he would be more comfortable working with that person vs. the other?

[23:34:29] <kurahaupo> mdogg: That's a good reason to take the hiring decision away from the person who will be their line manager
[23:34:30] <fentanyl> Hmm, not entirely sure since I've only talked with the interviewer, not with the manager. But maybe that's true.
[23:35:09] <fentanyl> Per the mere interview results, including behavioral interview points, the person scored less than person B.
[23:35:12] <LjL> darsie, it's used in a metaphorical way, those things are clearly not thought of as alive
[23:35:19] <darsie> ok :)
[23:35:52] * LjL doesn't even know what a "behavioral interview" is though he can sort of guess
[23:35:54] <mdogg> darsie‚¶Ç Ahh.  So in that context, no.  Products are not "alive" but products generally do have a "live span".
