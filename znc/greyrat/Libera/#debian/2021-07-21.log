Adjust the file mask from *.img to *.* if it doesn't show Debian .iso images.  See <usb install> and <install debian> for further details.

[12:14:16] <PMT> Bushdog: let's back up a step. Often these days, when a utility asks you for the password to do things as an administrator/root, they want your user password to use sudo to do them as root, not the password of the root user.
[12:14:44] <ratrace> actually when a polkit utility asks for a pass it's root, not sudo

[12:19:08] <ratrace> then I was wrong. but it definitely must be polkit doing this, not sudo/sudoers mechanism
[12:19:40] <ratrace> I guess things have changed since my last dissection of polkit internals. sorry for misinformation.   anyhoo, back to your problem

[12:23:58] <PMT> I've never looked at what -u versus -c actually does - I know what it does as stated, but does that mean it unpacks an existing one and applies changes, or generates a new one and only overwrites if there are changes, or only overwrites if there already is one, or ...

[12:54:01] <ratrace> it could be as simple as "apt full-upgrade", assuming you don't have extraneous repos, backports, etc... or it might involve some more work. _definitely_ read the release notes, what's new, what's changed, especially there are some apt configuration changes that are important (eg. pertaining to security repo naming in sources.list).

[13:13:30] <Bushdog> just a quick note to cadmio in my opinion, all Debian releases are good, I have Debian 9 in my other machine and running it for quite a few years with no problem, this machine I am typing has Debian 10 Buster and act as my Apache Web Server with no problem what so ever, bottom line is All Debian versions are robust, solid and stable ...
[13:16:10] <ratrace> shad: dma is Dragonfly Mail Agent. it's a simplistic agent that requires a mail server somewhere to relay mail via. it also stores mail in loccal spool for local useres, which is what jelly implied should be done here
[13:16:35] <ratrace> shad: cron send mail to the user running the tab as, for every stdout/stderr produced by the tab entry run
[13:16:41] <ratrace> sends*
[13:16:57] <jelly> shad, it's not the logs that go t mail.  It's output of cron jobs.  Useful to see what a cron job process outputted.
[13:18:17] *** Quits: beaver (~beaver@user/pong) (Remote host closed the connection)
[13:18:20] <ratrace> alternatively, don't use 1980s technology, write a systemd .timer and have the corresponding .service put all stdout/stderr thingies into journal :)
[13:18:23] <shad> ratrace: so iirc longtime ago when i setup mta for OpenSMTPd, installing this will result in a /var/spool/mail/<user> file that will contain crontab logs in mail format ?  
[13:19:06] <ratrace> shad: it's not "crontab logs in mail format". it's literally "cron took your command's stdout/stderr and put it into an email and emailed it to the user under which the tab was running"
[13:19:39] <shad> ratrace: i could do that, I need to see if Ansible can make my life easy on this one, instead of writing templates of services files

[13:21:01] <shad> I'd like to avoid having to setup a fully fledged SMTP server just to debug why my backups won't be delivered to S3

[13:21:26] *** Joins: Vizva (~vizva@gateway/tor-sasl/vizva)
[13:21:28] <ratrace> shad: right, so "dma" is as simplistic/lightweight as you get
[13:21:46] <ratrace> it'd also be prudent to have at least dma installed on every server, "just in case" something wants to email you, like cron
[13:21:50] *** Joins: nixpipe (~nixpipe@net-5-94-233-225.cust.vodafonedsl.it)
[13:22:24] <shad> The idea is hot backups to S3, transitionned 1 per month to S3 Glacier, have the other backups rotated on the 7th day 
[13:22:43] <ratrace> it requires a full fledged SMTP server somewhere, so you configure it to use your central MTA, preferrably with SASL and then you set a policy there where you'd want that mail sent or blocked. with aliases, you can also ahve all that delivered to your @gmail or whatever poison of choice in email providers you ahve there
[13:24:02] <ratrace> personally I'd prefer the "no mail for you!" policy for servers, and I'd use timers wherever possible but many things come with cron scripts and it's tedious to convert them all to timers, so lazily I just run dma too
[13:24:19] <ratrace> it'll take another decade, if at all, for these 1980s things to finally step into 21st century

[13:25:45] <ratrace> oh they are :) at the very least it uses proper .service units which can then talk to journal which can then be remoted to your central log, where it's monitored and reacted to by your automation
[13:26:27] <shad> also, what would be your startegy for rolling backups ? S3 seemed like a valid choice for the job
[13:26:29] <ratrace> AFAIK, there's no way for cron to do anyhting about stdout/stderr, except mail to you. which is insane, even if you hate systemd and run devuan, cron is ancient old incapable inflexible tech
[13:27:09] <shad> you had me at logging. Surely i can pipe that into my Loki stack and have the grafana dashboard tell me where are my backups

[16:38:31] <shtrb> You are just happy because you heard apparmor had been incorporated into systemd with proper defaults compiled in 
[16:38:56] <ratrace> this is not about systemd but about the application ecosystem being flaptaksnap'd mostly.

[16:40:04] <ratrace> and not sure what you mean by "apparmor incorporated into systemd".  systemd has been supporting named apparmor profiles in service units for.... quite some time now. and selinux contexts.
[16:42:51] <ratrace> here's the thing. I already nspawn containerize services on servers. I succumbed to the flexibility, power and control of deploying strictly versioned and configured applications.  is installing from a <some other containerization tech> really that different?

[16:58:26] <pasiz> and best idea of shared library system is lost when snappin or flatpak
[16:59:12] <aaro> after applying a systemd package upgrade is it necessary to reboot?
[16:59:16] <ratrace> there's pros and cons of containerized app delivery. I'm just concerend that in the future, upstreams will only care about pros
[16:59:22] <ratrace> aaro: no
[16:59:41] <ratrace> but there's also a kernel upgrade for a filesystem vuln, so you should reboot after that
[16:59:55] <pasiz> biggest con is binary size, that is quite small in *nix systems
[17:00:28] <ratrace> no. biggest con is loss of ability to patch vulnerabilities by patching one package
[17:01:19] <ratrace> so you have 10 running snaps, with 10 potentially different versions of libssl and all 10 would have to individually upgrade to fix a vuln
[17:01:23] <aaro> ratrace: ok thanks

[20:56:43] <sney> it's needrestart or checkrestart
[20:56:58] <jhutchins> I wish it were easier to compare uname -a with dpkg -l linux-image-amd64
[20:57:00] <jhutchins> They look like completely unrelated packages.
[21:02:23] <PMT> You might find it better to compare linux-image-amd64's Depends package's dpkg -l to uname -a

[21:13:16] <PMT> jhutchins: I mean, if you're looking for something to remember, check the filenames in /boot/ and compare the output of file /boot/vmlinuz-foo to uname -a
[21:14:19] <PMT> I'd still recommend scripting it instead, though, if you need to worry about it often.
[21:15:08] <sney> or use zfs like me and PMT and the rest of the cool kids, and it'll full screen ncurses tell you to reboot any time you get a new kernel 
[21:16:04] <PMT> Hey, my upgrade of 4.19.0-17-amd64 from 2 to 3 didn't prompt me for shit. ;)
[21:16:39] <sney> ah yeah, because the abi didn't change so it didn't need to rebuild zfs 
[21:16:43] <sney> but most of them do it
[21:17:29] <PMT> Sure, but if that was their only concern they could just compare dpkg-query --showformat='${Depends}' --show linux-image-amd64 to uname -r, but that won't catch the upgrade I just mentioned.
[21:18:24] <jhutchins> PMT: The working question is, I'm upgrading four systems.  Two get kernels.  Did this one get the new kernel yet, and does this one need to reboot?

[21:19:05] <PMT> Well, the general answer (FSVO general) would be my first two answers. If you only care about cases of things like 4.19.0-16-amd64 to -17-amd64, the latter will do.
