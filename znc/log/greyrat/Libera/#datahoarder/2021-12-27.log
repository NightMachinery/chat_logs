[01:56:54] <ThePendulum> aww tutu died
[02:14:37] <skye0> well, i have to do my mirroring AGAIN because i forgot i didn't have my hard drives plugged in
[02:14:46] <skye0> and now everything's deleted as per my script so i'm gonna have to back it up all again
[02:15:06] <ThePendulum> D:
[02:15:13] <ThePendulum> what was it mirroring to then?
[02:15:53] <skye0> no directory and it decided to delete everything (which i intentionally do for confidentiality reasons)
[02:16:32] <skye0> all i want to do at this point is just play games but i don't have time for it now that i have a full time job
[02:17:03] <skye0> honestly i think it's better i get hooked on booze instead. instant guarantee for fun or to take away happiness, but it does leave me feeling irritated after
[02:17:13] <ThePendulum> no time off for the holidays?
[02:18:16] <skye0> not very much and i haven't booked leave yet (saving it for a bit later)
[02:19:59] <skye0> if i wanted to automate this, i'll have to figure out how to export the history database(s) as different file formats from Mozilla firefox, export the bookmarks as HTML as well as taking the .json files that enumerate the bookmarks and likely do the same with bookmarks for MS Edge too. I need the HTML bookmark file just for reference - I already scrape from the json bookmarks file for MS Edgium through a script someone recommended here or on
