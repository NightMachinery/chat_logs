[01:08:13] <smrtz> Hey everyone! I'm trying to figure out a clean way to get just "5c:88:16" out of "192.168.50.1 is-at 5c:88:16:7c:a6:c7".  I've currently got echo $line | awk '{print $3}' | awk '{FS = ":"}; {print $1":"$2":"$3}' but that just prints the full MAC plus "::". Any idea what I'm doing wrong?
[01:10:39] *** Joins: lavaball (felix@31.204.155.215)
[01:13:24] <emanuele6> that semicolon is weird.
[01:13:52] <emanuele6> you probably meant BEGIN { FS = ":" } { print $1":"$2":"$3 }
[01:14:19] <emanuele6> anyway, if it's a shell variable, it makes no sense to use echo$line|awk
[01:14:24] <smrtz> Oh! That's probably it!
[01:16:48] <emanuele6> you can just use shell.  out=${line##* } out=${out%:"${out#*:*:*:}"}
[01:17:07] <smrtz> Great, thanks!

[01:25:30] <emanuele6> if you assume it's a full mac address, you can also simplify it as
[01:25:58] <emanuele6>     out=${line##* } out=${out%:*:*:*}
[01:26:46] <emanuele6> i.e. "delete last 3 octets instead" or "keep the first 3 octets"
[01:27:34] <emanuele6> s/or/of/
[01:28:34] <emanuele6> err
[01:28:51] <emanuele6> i.e. "delete the last 3 octets" instead of "keep the first 3 octets"
[01:33:51] <smrtz> Lol I knew what you meant with the /s. Thanks!

[04:08:20] <smrtz> I'm trying to have awk remove the previous linebreak if the first letter of the current line is "V". Here's an example: https://bpa.st/OTRA  Here's what I've got so far, but obviously it's horribly broken: awk '{CURR=$0 next; if($0==^#) print $CURR " -- " $0; next;}'  Any suggestions?
[04:08:35] *** Quits: Everything (~Everythin@37.115.210.35) (Quit: leaving)
[04:09:07] <smrtz> Typo, my current attempt is awk '{CURR=$0 next; if($0==^V) print $CURR " -- " $0; next;}'
[04:14:20] <emanuele6> ^V?
[04:14:26] <emanuele6> CURR=$0 next is not valid
[04:15:10] <emanuele6> what you want is just   awk -v RS= -F'\n' '{ print $1 " -- " $2 }'
[04:15:23] <smrtz> Doesn't `^V` check if the first letter is `V`?
[04:15:51] <emanuele6> oh, what?
[04:16:07] <emanuele6> no, that is `~ /^v/'
[04:16:15] <emanuele6> but what are you trying to do then?
[04:17:49] <smrtz> I was thinking I should set the current line to a variable (curr), move to the following line, checkif the first letter starts with V, and finally print curr " -- " $0
[04:18:13] <emanuele6> i asked "what are you trying to do?".
[04:19:42] <smrtz> Uhh, replay a pcap through tcpdump while filtering for DNS requests, print the Client-Ethernet-Address and Vendor-Class fields for each one.
[04:20:16] <smrtz> %s/DNS/DHCP/gc
[04:20:31] <emanuele6> then why does your example contain stuff like "test0" "vtest" "this" "vthat"?
[04:21:25] <emanuele6> the example is very ambiguous
[04:21:53] <smrtz> I didn't want to post the actual MAC and vendor elements, so I created a garbage file that would demonstrate the problem.  Currently I've got a text file with just the Client-Ethernet-Address and Vendor-Class fields, each on a new line, sometimes with random extra lines in between.
[04:22:26] <emanuele6> that example could be interpreted in many ways
[04:22:37] <emanuele6> and the presence of empty lines is just confusing
[04:22:56] <emanuele6> i still don't get what you are trying to do
[04:24:32] <emanuele6> i wild guess could be   awk 'l && /^v/ { print l " -- " $0; next } { l = $0 }'
[04:24:36] <emanuele6> but who knows
[04:24:44] <emanuele6> should the empty lines be ignored? idk
[04:25:08] <emanuele6> s/^i w/a w/
[04:27:20] <emanuele6> maybe `next' is not wanted. maybe you want to set `l = ""' before `next'. maybe you only want to check for /^v/ without checking l
[04:27:22] <smrtz> Here's an example of the file I've got: https://bpa.st/XOEQ and here's what I want: https://bpa.st/OZAA  If there's an empty line, or any other random text between a Client-Ethernet-Address and Vendor-Class line those Client-Ethernet-Address and Vendor-Class lines should be ignored.
[04:28:38] <emanuele6> they are all ***
[04:29:22] <emanuele6> why are there 4 lines in the output, but 7 Vendor-Class lines on the input?
[04:29:35] <emanuele6> how am i supposed to understand this?
[04:30:45] <emanuele6> should the *** on the Client-Ethernet-Address lines and on the Vendor-Class lines be the same? no idea, they are both ***.
[04:30:52] <emanuele6> s/both/all/
[04:31:00] <smrtz> 3 Vendor-Class lines do not have a Client-Ethernet-Address line immediately above them. If the immediately preceding line is not a Client-Ethernet-Address line, it should be ignored.
[04:32:16] <smrtz> Maybe it would be easier to "Invert" the file and then print the Vendor-Class line and the following if the following starts with Client-Ethernet-Class?
[04:35:11] <emanuele6> ok, so the 3rd, 4th and 5th lines are the one that don't appear in the output. 
[04:36:20] <emanuele6> honestly i was thinking it was the last three lines personally, since the first line is 3***, i thought that maybe meant that you only wanted that line and the 3 after
[04:36:22] <smrtz> Lines 1, 6, and 9 are invalid. I'm sorry I'm having a hard time explaining this. It's been a long day, hah
[04:36:40] <emanuele6> how is anyone supposed to understand what you are trying to do, honestly.
[04:37:33] <smrtz> I have no idea. It's convoluted I know. I can make a different example with random entries instead of ***s if you'd like?
[04:38:03] <emanuele6> if only you use something different on every line and not just *** on all of them.
[04:39:13] <emanuele6> s/e/ed/1
[04:40:46] <smrtz> Input: https://bpa.st/IPQA output: https://bpa.st/ZNXQ
[04:41:19] <emanuele6> now you have just the literal lines instead of MAC: *** --- "***", whatever
[04:43:06] <smrtz> That's fine. I don't really care about the exact wording of the output, just the mapping
[04:43:23] <smrtz> I can always search/replace the exact strings later
[04:45:12] <emanuele6> if you keep this up, people will not be willing to help you.
[04:45:28] <emanuele6> probably something like this:
[04:45:30] <emanuele6>   /^Client-Ethernet-Address / { addr = $0; if (getline class == 1 && /^Vendor-Class /) print addr " -- " class } 
[04:45:43] <emanuele6> oops
[04:45:51] <emanuele6>   /^Client-Ethernet-Address / { addr = $0; if (getline == 1 && /^Vendor-Class /) print addr " -- " $0 } 
[04:46:33] <roarde> Where do I find the best awk.1?
[04:47:28] <smrtz> emanuele6 Thanks! I'll read up on getline now. Seems like that's the real part I was missing when trying to do this earlier.
[04:50:52] <emanuele6> ( and your pastes have DOS newlines too :(, you are really making our lives hard )
[04:51:23] <smrtz> Hah, I hadn't realized that. Thanks for the tip.
[04:52:59] <emanuele6> honestly though, i am not even going to try to help you next time, if you don't start describing your problems in a way that makes sense
[04:56:19] <roarde> Never the case here, but:
[04:57:53] <roarde> If one is working with a unix server, but from a windows desktop, how can pasting DOS line-endings be avoided?
[05:00:24] <emanuele6> roarde: are you asking us how to use windows? 
[05:00:35] <roarde> Yes.
[05:00:56] <pr3d4t0r> roarde: man dostounix
[05:01:12] <pr3d4t0r> roarde: Er...  dos2unix
[05:01:25] <emanuele6> i know how i would upload a file as with DOS line ending from a unix system.
[05:01:28] <roarde> umm, "man" tells me that may not work on someone's windows system
[05:01:50] <pr3d4t0r> roarde: You move the file to the UNIX system, then run that command there.
[05:01:56] <roarde> and i don't have either of those manpages
[05:02:03] <pr3d4t0r> roarde: If you go the other way then conver the file, then download it.
[05:02:13] <emanuele6> so your question is basically like asking "how can i painlessly use windows?", lol
[05:02:19] <pr3d4t0r> Heh.
[05:02:31] <roarde> nor do i have the applications
[05:02:32] <pr3d4t0r> roarde: What are you trying to accomplish?
[05:02:53] <pr3d4t0r> emanuele6: There is WSL...
[05:02:57] * pr3d4t0r shudders.
[05:03:29] <roarde> Just want to know how it's fairly easily done when a windows-user on the other end needs or wants to do it.
[05:03:34] <emanuele6> pr3d4t0r: the question is how to upload a paste with UNIX line ending from windows
[05:03:56] <pr3d4t0r> emanuele6: Aha.
[05:04:12] <pr3d4t0r> emanuele6: Paste it where?  GitHub deals with it automagically in Gist.
[05:04:14] <emanuele6> i can easily the opposite from UNIX, but i don't know how to do it in windows and that is basically what roarde is asking here in #awk
[05:04:32] <emanuele6> s/y/y do/1
[05:04:39] <pr3d4t0r> emanuele6: Heh - yeah.  That sounds like a very long way to China.
[05:04:59] <pr3d4t0r> emanuele6: Because then he'll need some AWK.EXE thing as well :P
[05:05:07] <roarde> I nominate this for line-of-the-day. Seconds?  emanuele6> i can easily the opposite from UNIX, but i don't know how to do it in windows and that is basically what roarde is asking here in #awk
[05:05:11] <pr3d4t0r> roarde: Did you try https://gist.github.com ?

[05:08:37] <pr3d4t0r> e36freak: I just returned from P-burgh.  No excursions to nearby places because I ran away from the huge storm coming yo' way.
[05:08:51] <e36freak> pr3d4t0r: i was up there a couple weeks ago
[05:09:43] <pr3d4t0r> e36freak: Heh.
[05:09:57] <pr3d4t0r> e36freak: I went to CMU for meetings on Friday - empty.  So is UofP.
[05:10:17] <pr3d4t0r> e36freak: They gave the students a couple of extra weeks to outrun the omicrón wave.  Good move.
[05:10:35] <e36freak> i see
