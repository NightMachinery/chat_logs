[01:15:33] <mickey8> in a benchmark, when i get Benchmark_Sanitize-12    	       1	1890586700 ns/op	  459456 B/op	    3724 allocs/op, this means b.N was run 1 time, and it took it 1890586700 nanoseconds to complete, right?
[01:17:25] <blinux> I'm really not familiar with that kind of data. But, it looks like it is saying nano-seconds per operation, Byes per operation and allocations (memory?) per operation.

[01:36:33] <bpalmer> mickey8: for most tasks, running it just once (b.N = 1) is incredibly noisy.
[01:37:05] <mickey8> bpalmer it chooses how many times to run on its own
[01:38:24] <bpalmer> mickey8: go test takes a -count command line flag.
[01:39:03] <mickey8> i didnt specify it. sometimes it does b.N = 1, sometimes hundreds or even thousands
[01:39:49] <fizzie> You can do -benchtime=60s to tell it to run for "about a minute".
[01:40:08] <fizzie> Then it'll generally speaking do more repeats. The default is just one second per benchmark.
[01:41:47] <fizzie> (So if you've got something that takes 1890586700ns, or 1.9s, to run just once, that's what it does.)

[02:04:37] <nitrix> Hopefully it cleans up some of the library functions and types, like sort.Sort and company.
[02:05:24] <nitrix> It'll be interesting to see what they choose. The Go 1.0 promise of compatibility or keeping the language consistent and sane.
[02:05:57] <seebs> i suspect both. the new generic things will be in /x/ for now and will eventually get packages that don't break the existing packages.
[02:07:03] <nitrix> That's what I fear. Then you end up with an old obsolete way of doing things that people recommend against, and a newer way, with endless debates.
[02:07:38] <nitrix> I personally hope they bite the bullet. The go.mod file has a Go version in it, that should be enough.
[02:08:37] <nitrix> And you could have `go fix` upgrade between versions, like they claimed it would.
[02:09:35] <nitrix> Even though, a more generic sort.Sort should remain for the most part compatible with the more concrete usages present in code bases; minus where it's passed into a high-order function.

[02:10:34] <bpalmer> eh. A simple sort.SortT()  wouldn't be the worst thing.

[02:11:44] <seebs> i certainly use sort on things which are comparable but where i don't want to use < to compare them

[07:29:31] <seebs> ohhh, i was wrong about errors.As, apparently, and... don't use that
[07:30:13] <seebs> so the problem is, errors.As is trying to match something to a type, and then it's trying to *write a value into the object you give it*
[07:30:30] <seebs> "context.Canceled" is the one true global universal Canceled error object
[07:30:36] <seebs> you should ABSOLUTELY NOT be overwriting it

[07:30:42] <seebs> but errors.As isn't the right tool here!

[07:31:54] <seebs> What you probably want here is "errors.Is(err, context.Canceled)", but you may actually still not want that.

[07:34:30] <dostoyevsky2> I do `response, err := client.Do(req)' and if I cancel the request, the err will be set but cancel is not an error in my code... because I implement a first-duplicate-reply-cancels-all-other-requests pattern
[07:36:51] <seebs> i was under the impression that the returned errors from client.Do were always of type *url.Error
[07:38:18] <seebs> so, i guess errors.Is is probably reasonable there. Anyway, I don't know. I guess I'd start with trying this to see whether it appears to actually produce the expected behavior -- a cancel causing you to get that test succeeding. If so, then ?probably? it works that way? I'm not actually sure whether to expect that. You could also check the context itself, as an alternative.
[07:44:05] <dostoyevsky2> https://go.dev/play/p/e2OGdubZLlE <- I tried to make it as small as possible but it's still 83 LoC
[07:45:34] <seebs> hmm
[07:45:57] <seebs> this feels messy but i'm having a hard time articulating why. you have this extra done channel you made, but you already have a context you can cancel.
[07:46:21] <seebs> and presumably, the right course would be to have a *shared* cancelable context which *all* the requests use, so if any of them comes back with a response, you cancel the request and all the others clean up.
[07:46:35] <seebs> because you already got your response and the cancelled context won't take it away from you.

[07:52:16] <dostoyevsky2> seebs: I don't think I can call the cancelFunc from outside a go routine... I need the done channel to trigger that inside the respective go routine... I tried calling the cancelFuncs directly in main() from the main go routine, storing all the cancels in a sync.Map -- but the race detector just had pages of complaints
[07:53:22] <dostoyevsky2> This is now the first version where the race detector doesn't complain anymore
[07:58:35] <blinux> Anyone have the vim-go syntax highlithing working where it matches vscode/codium? Some of the colors are different and some are not working at all. I'm using the Dracula theme. I thought I got it working fully once using the vim-go vimrc settings, but it doesn't seem like enough.

[08:07:20] <seebs> there is no such thing as "outside a go routine".
[08:07:31] <seebs> everything is always goroutines. and you can call a cancel func from anywhere.
[08:07:38] <alyx> hi, I have a pointer to a struct (*foo) and I need a uh.. the words are escaping me, but not a pointer version (so just foo), is there a way to beat go into doing this?
[08:07:52] <seebs> so, you send off a request, which is using a context which has a cancel, and if you get a response, you call cancel, so any other requests using that context are canceled.
[08:08:00] <seebs> you don't need multiple cancels!
[08:08:17] <seebs> as soon as *any* of them returns, you can cancel the whole "sending out lots of requests", so they can all have the *same* context and cancel func.

[08:08:35] <seebs> alyx: if you have a *foo, and you want a foo: plain = *ptr
[08:08:50] <alyx> oh neat
[08:09:48] <seebs> this sort of reflects the old C idiom, although it's not as overwhelming and confusing as it was then, but the old statement was "declaration reflects use", so in C, "int *i" just meant that the expression "*i" was of type int, therefore, i was of type (int *).
[08:10:08] <seebs> go spells it as type "*int", but the basic notion is the same; "var ip *int; var i int; ip = &i; i = *ip"

[17:18:05] <misuto> Hello! I recently tested go 1.18beta2 and managed to get a segfault when running. The problem is not present when compiling with 1.16.13 and go 1.17.7. Is this a known problem or something that i should report on the issue tracker?

[20:32:45] <alyx> Hi! I have a struct, vaguely along the lines of https://p.aws.vg/cqk9 -- is there any way to abuse json/marshal (or, really, whatever else.. but right now I'd convert the whole thing into JSON w/ json/marshal) so that it would marshal the Tags item into a []string composed of the Tag.Value items from the Tags array?
[20:33:15] *** Joins: adip_ (~adip@user-188-33-226-1.play-internet.pl)
[20:37:15] <fizzie> Not really. I mean, you can have a `type TagList []Tag` and then a `func (tl TagList) MarshalJSON() ([]byte, error) { ... }` that has a loop that builds that []string and marshals it, and then using `Tags TagList` instead of `Tags []Tag` in the struct will cause it to behave like that when marshaling the struct with encoding/json.
[20:39:38] <alyx> Huh that.. could work. Thanks!

[23:53:53] <seebs> i guess? it's pointless but it won't break anything, i guess.

[23:54:45] <KirkMcDonald> The docs say: "A Mutex must not be copied after first use."
[23:54:51] <vt> seebs: the idea being having a separate function to initialise the structure, just to tidy the code. I could really embed GetItem in the loop, but I want the code to be clearer to read
[23:54:57] <KirkMcDonald> From which I infer that copying a zero value around is fine.
[23:55:15] <seebs> yeah.

[23:56:40] <vt> Thank you, I missed the 'after use' part. (so I can use GetItem as a "macro", hoping Golang will inline it in the loop, that is not performance-critical anyway as the number of element is quite small and it's run only one time)
[23:59:59] <b0nn> um, sorry, why would you /copy/ it, and not pass a pointer to it?
