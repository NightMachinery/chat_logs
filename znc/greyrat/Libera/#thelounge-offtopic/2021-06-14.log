[18:31:32] <richrd> looks like libera will surpass freenodes user count at some point  https://lounge.bittemple.org/uploads/a39ed6aa0c4d0d91/image.png 
[18:41:33] <aab_> Holy heck if that graphs right what happened within the last 5 days ðŸ˜‚
[18:42:29] <aab_> Libera now has 28 active servers with 33045 users
[19:33:58] <zoite> they banned irccloud and kicked gnu and linux off the network basically
[19:45:10] <eliocamp> This is a nifty dashboard to follow https://isfreenodedeadyet.com/
[19:45:21] <shadoozo> lol

[19:51:54] <aab_> wtf according to them graphs libera has passed freenode user count
[19:52:13] <aab_> oh that's the forcast
[19:52:17] <aab_> haha

[20:03:30] <bookworm> that's assuming linear growth which we all know is not the true underlaying rate
[20:03:47] <bookworm> IRC has been pretty stagnant as far as new users go
[20:05:51] <eliocamp> I don't think those are new users, though. It's users changing from one network to the other. That could be approximately linear for now. 
[20:08:33] <bookworm> at least in my channels all the regulars are already here and that's good enough for me. I had freenode still active in my bouncer because I didn't really mind until they started to royally fuck up
[20:08:55] <bookworm> I guess lots of others just have it idling in their bouncers too
[20:09:33] <bookworm> doesn't mean that there's activity though, which is the much more interesting metric
[20:10:02] <bookworm> look at FN #thelounge, 300+ nicks, activity 0
[20:10:10] <bookworm> (by force that one, granted)
[20:11:43] <eliocamp> Yeah, I think that's what's supposed to show this plot towards the bottom https://i.imgur.com/kgYSyt4.png
[20:12:59] <aab_> I don't think there are stats for active users just connected users.  Well I haven't seen any
