[08:36:36] <sd> 03<Hâ€‹urdyGurdyBurdy> I've got an interesting question; without having to reboot/run any stresstests, is there a way to determine where an ecc error may be residing? SEL shows the dimm, but I'm wondering if it's even possible to narrow it down without too much intervention since the box likes to shutdown.
[08:37:49] <sd> 03<Hâ€‹urdyGurdyBurdy> through my reading, it seems like it's a crap-shoot for finding the addr of the problem block as motherboards sometimes like to interweave memory between all the dimms rather than have them segmented in-order
[08:38:08] <sd> 03<Hâ€‹urdyGurdyBurdy> outside of running memtest and having it just report where the blocks are
[08:42:30] <Hunterkll> you'd have to have a memory tester like i do

[18:22:30] <sd> 07<Mâ€‹MCCORD> Yeah we strip all that shit from our images.  Edge chromium ends up back on it
[18:22:49] <sd> 07<Mâ€‹MCCORD> We also block the store via gp anyway, so removing it doesnâ€™t matter
[18:27:46] <A-KO> you really shouldn't block the store, but instead manage it with the store for business
[18:27:53] <A-KO> you're missing security updates and other stuff by blocking the store
[18:27:55] <A-KO> just an FYI

[19:06:35] <sd> 08<bâ€‹denlinger> Anything installed from the app store, so probably Cortana at least.
[19:08:32] <cryptic1> yes.. preinstalled windows store apps or installed windows store apps are updated using the windows store
[19:08:38] <cryptic1> come on guys you should know this
[19:14:16] <sd> 07<Mâ€‹MCCORD> ... but I remove them all, so why would I need to update them
[19:19:44] <sd> 07<Mâ€‹MCCORD> except for calculator of course.
[19:20:25] <sd> 07<Mâ€‹MCCORD> I'll keep my eyes out for a critical calculator update.  Hasn't been updated since 2020 so I think I'm safe for now
[19:21:40] <monr0e> Frankly if I was administering a windows shop, I'd be getting rid of the windows 10 calculator and putting the win7 one in. A calculator doesn't need internet access, its just another vulnerability
[19:21:57] <monr0e> thats my grumble for the day
[19:22:12] <sd> 07<Mâ€‹MCCORD> I tried to find a way.  I liked the old calc better.
[19:22:12] <DrZak> what the hell are you talking about
[19:22:29] <DrZak> why would anybody care about a calculator
[19:26:06] <monr0e> The windows 10 calculator can make outbound calls and receive inbound messages to perform currency conversion. Realistically, though, its such a niche use-case that it isn't worth having. I bet you somewhere down the line there's going to be some cve involving the calculator.
