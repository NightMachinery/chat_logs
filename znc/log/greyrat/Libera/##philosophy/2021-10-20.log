[03:01:18] <causative> some people do have penis envy or vagina envy: those are called trans people, and they are a small minority. Perhaps some people have castration anxiety or an oedipus complex too, but how many? I can't say I've ever worried about castration or wanted to take the place of my father
[03:02:26] <vaquero> causative:  i only recently found out there was a fetish of men who are aroused at the thought of being a woman
[03:03:12] <Player001> you really should try to understand certain things before talking about them
[03:04:56] <causative> yes, I am aware that when Freud says "penis envy" he doesn't literally mean that anybody actually envies having a penis, that would be too empirically testable and thus refutable, so Freud avoids it like the plague. Instead he concocts some complicated nonsense about how penis envy leads to other things, without evidence of its existence in the first place.

[03:19:36] <Player001> well, Freudo-Lacanian psychoanalysis is not exactly "untestable" as it were. If certain things were not true, neither would psychoanalysis be true.
[03:20:56] <causative> then how would you construct a test for whether Freudian penis envy is real among a majority of women?
[03:23:57] <causative> of course, if you gave them surveys about it, the vast majority would obviously tell you they do not have penis envy - "oh, I forgot to mention the dragon in my garage is invisible"
[03:25:03] <Player001> we would carefully analyze the notion of phallus in Lacan, connecting it with the rest of his work, work in the broader humanities, immanent critiques, discourses in the rest of human sciences

[03:27:26] <vaquero> causative:  curious so are you against the idea of an unconscious mind or more of the opinion that fraud specifically was a quack
[03:27:30] <Player001> psychology is a different discourse than psychoanalysis
[03:27:55] <Player001> plus we could see in it a bit of a positivist turn
[03:27:59] <causative> well vaquero certainly there is an unconscious mind - we are not consciously aware of everything going on in our brain
[03:28:19] <causative> but it doesn't work the way Freud thought
[03:29:02] <econo> but if it's true, then therapeutic treatments using insights from it should yield measurable results, right?
[03:30:29] <causative> econo, that's not a good criterion for success - "talk therapy" is proved to be clinically effective, and I don't think that depends on whether it is Freudian
[03:30:29] <vaquero> causative:  thats fair, i see freud as more of a stepping stone in the progress of the field rather than the be all and end all of it.
[03:31:00] <causative> talk therapy is effective because having someone in authority listen to your problems and occasionally offer practical advice is helpful
[03:31:22] <econo> sure
[03:31:23] <causative> it gets you thinking about your problems and their solutions

[03:34:04] <econo> causative if we're talking about a true theory of mind that is supposedly therapeutic though, effectiveness is at least a minimal test though
[03:34:33] <causative> well, perhaps, but not a great test, because the effectiveness of talk therapy is due to non-Freudian factors
[03:34:48] <causative> if Freudian talk therapy was more effective than non-Freudian talk therapy, that might be a decent test
[03:36:39] <Player001> well the goal of analysis is truth
[03:36:47] <Player001> the truth of the subject's desire
[03:37:25] <causative> if you want to seek truth, you need to use a process that mercilessly identifies and weeds out untruths in an objective way
[03:38:20] <Player001> and a test an empirical sort of test might be "using treatment A (psychoanalysis) and treatment B (CBT), which group of subjects is able to articulate their desire more often?"
[03:38:38] <econo> causative yes, Freudian talk therapy would require using insights from Freudian analysis. I think we're saying the same thing
[03:38:56] <Player001> but this of course would presuppose Lacanian psychoanalysis because the notion of the truth of a subject desire is defined therein
[03:39:16] <Player001> so it's just immanent

[04:49:53] <causative> thunder, depends on what you mean by "hamlet"
[04:50:04] <thunder> I mean shakespeare's play
[04:50:28] <causative> depends on what you mean by a play
[04:50:54] <causative> the text of the play can be argued to exist in the human's head
[04:50:58] <thunder> the point is to question what we regard as objects, and to place them into their true context as subjective mental constructs
[04:51:00] <causative> if their recollection is sufficiently good
[04:51:27] <causative> a "play" is also a performance of the text
[04:51:43] <causative> and by that sense, there is no play of Hamlet, since no one is at that moment performing it
[04:52:32] <causative> and a "play" might be considered also to be the fictional story told by the performance and the text - a story that includes such things as Hamlet himself, and Ophelia, and the poison
[04:52:46] <causative> and those things do not exist and never have

[04:54:58] <thunder> putting aside the hair splitting word play, the point is that the play isn't just a physical object, no matter how many physical representations it may have. it is first and foremost an panoply of ideas, in the same way as any other object we can identify.
[04:56:22] <causative> the memory of the play in the person's brain is a physical representation of it
[04:56:44] <causative> if that too goes away, do you say the play still exists, or does not?
[04:58:30] <thunder> unless you are a neurosurgion who has studied the neurological changes which occur when a group of each people memorize hamlet, and compared to those who did not, I doubt you can claim this from any firmer basis than hearsay.
[04:59:18] <causative> don't you agree that there *are* such changes, and that in some way the memory of the play is encoded within the synapses of the brain?
[04:59:43] <causative> no one knows the precise mechanism of memory, but neuroscientists are confident that there is one
[04:59:44] <thunder> I strongly suspect that's true, but I can't claim that as empirically true. nor can you.
[05:00:11] <causative> well, it's the conclusion of modern neuroscience
[05:00:21] <thunder> yet somehow, we still are able to remember. just as apples still fell from the tree before newton came along.
[05:00:26] <causative> why else would people lose memories when their brain is damaged, as happens in Alzheimer's?
[05:01:38] <thunder> okay. so the hearsay includes what appears to be plausible episteme. that's good. but lacking gnosis (ie. direct experience), the opinion is still based fundamentally on hearsay. unless you're a neuroscientist?
[05:03:13] <thunder> my point is, it's all well and good to say "science good. rah rah rah!", but it's also necessary to remain humble to the fact that the *vast* majority of what you (and I) accept as scientific facts, is ultimately for our part, merely hearsay we've chosen to accept. much like a religious person accepts the bible.
[05:03:25] <causative> we accept them for good reasons
[05:03:30] <thunder> notwithstanding other religious obviously
[05:03:38] <causative> because we know that the process of science *does* ultimately draw its facts from looking at the world
[05:04:08] <thunder> sure. I agree for the same reason. but I'm not fooling myself about the fact that this is simply my opinion based on hearsay.
[05:04:19] <causative> it's a justified opinion then
[05:04:25] <thunder> really?
[05:04:31] <causative> I just gave the justification
[05:04:43] <causative> "because we know that the process of science *does* ultimately draw its facts from looking at the world"
[05:04:53] <causative> for this reason we trust the consensus of scientists in their field
[05:05:54] <causative> we know the many successes of science, they are all around us
[05:06:14] <causative> every factory-made item was made possible through a great deal of science
[05:06:23] <thunder> I can also look at the world, make guesses, and test them. as can anyone. you don't need to submit to arxiv for that to be true. it's how thousands of years of traditional medicine was developed for example. it doesn't cease to be true just because there's no "study" anymore than gravity failed to exist prior to newton
[05:06:59] <causative> traditional medicine does too little of looking at the world and too much of trusting authorities
[05:07:13] <thunder> that's the pot calling the kettle black
[05:07:36] <causative> every scientist wants to make a name for themselves by proving something shocking, that overturns established dogma, and proving their claim through rigorous experimentation and observation
[05:07:47] <causative> that isn't true for traditional medicine
[05:08:14] <causative> we, who are not scientists, must rely on authority, but scientists themselves are all hoping to overturn authority in their small domain
[05:08:15] <thunder> every private company which pays scientists wants to make money, and will spin the data to demonstrate their product is worthy of it
[05:08:47] <causative> well, if the only voices saying something are scientists in companies with an interest in the thing being true, then we would do well to distrust them
[05:09:00] <causative> that would be a breakdown in the process of science
[05:09:24] <causative> fortunately this is not the case for neuroscientists telling us that memories reside in the patterns of synapses in the brain
[05:09:26] <thunder> yes. you can't just take everything as true "because science". that's nonsense.
[05:09:41] <thunder> there're other factors to consider along side
[05:09:48] <thunder> many which take precedence
[05:09:56] <causative> if we have reason to consider that a conclusion was reached through good science, then we should accept this conclusion
[05:10:13] <causative> if we have reason to consider that it was reached through bad science or no science, then we should not
[05:11:01] <thunder> sure. the same goes for everything. fwiw, there's a reason why pharmaceutical companies pay anthropologists and ethnobotonists to go talk with shamans
[05:11:21] <thunder> it's not because traditional medicine is bs
[05:11:24] <causative> yes it is
[05:11:35] <thunder> lol
[05:11:43] <causative> if it wasn't bs, of course they'd want to talk to the shamans to get marketable ideas
[05:12:02] <thunder> right. like nearly every medicine on the market for example
[05:12:16] <thunder> derived from ethnobotanical sources originally
[05:12:26] <thunder> ie. from shamans and their traditional medicine
[05:13:14] <thunder> folks who are much more concerned with keeping their community healthy, than they are with buying their next yaught
[05:13:20] <causative> well, the drug that is closest to me right now is gabapentin, which I give to my dog to reduce her aggression

[05:13:21] <ro-bot-o> [url] Gabapentin - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[05:13:32] <causative> it wasn't from traditional sources, it was designed in a lab
[05:14:01] <thunder> there're certainly exceptions. but they are exceptions
[05:14:27] <causative> in the news lately is the covid vaccines, which were designed in a lab, not from traditional sources
[05:14:53] <causative> and ivermectin has been in the news also, which was also designed in a lab https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivermectin#History
[05:14:54] <ro-bot-o> [url] Ivermectin - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[05:15:13] <thunder> yeah. time to revisit what I was saying above about questioning the motives

[05:19:19] <causative> well, some do, but you aren't randomly picking drugs like I was

[05:19:34] <ro-bot-o> [url] Chloroquine - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[05:20:43] <thunder> the bottom line is that traditional medicine is still widely used, even while the same people who market it's derivatives disparage it out the other side of their mouths.
[05:21:04] <causative> well, *some* practices from traditional medicine turned out to work
[05:21:08] <causative> others did not
[05:21:20] <causative> we shouldn't trust a method *just because* it came from traditional medicine
[05:21:23] <thunder> same can be said of pharma dude
[05:21:53] <causative> we should trust a method only if it passed through the right kind of process to test it empirically and rigorously
[05:22:17] <thunder> of course not. but the presence of a study isn't an indication something is legit just "because science". some cultures have been running the experiment for hundreds if not thousands of years already. no need for the study.
[05:22:57] <causative> some cultures have been believing in gods and magic for hundreds if not thousands of years already
[05:23:08] <thunder> or shilling poison for a profit
[05:23:10] <causative> they haven't been "running the experiment" - there is no experiment
[05:23:19] <causative> they've been doing what was traditional
[05:23:23] <thunder> did the people get healthy? yes or no?
[05:23:28] <causative> that is not good enough
[05:23:33] <thunder> lol
[05:23:41] <causative> most people heal from most illnesses regardless of treatment
[05:24:10] <causative> to tell whether the drug is truly *effective* at helping them heal, you have to do a large scale controlled study
[05:24:27] <causative> you have to do the statistics to find out if the rate of healing with the drug is truly greater than the rate without
[05:24:35] <thunder> I'm gonna bow out of the convo at this point. I think I've made the points I wanted to make sufficiently. gonna go do something else for a bit.

[07:03:43] <causative> anyway. If pointing out the location of a dock is part of language, it is nonverbal, it is visual. If we allow that nonverbal, visual signals can be part of language, then we allow that images, such as bar charts or photographs, may be part of language.
[07:04:17] <causative> and what we see in our experiment where a ball falls is an image. And who has communicated this image to us? The ball itself.
[07:05:07] <causative> so nature talks to us - nonverbally - just as humans may talk to each other, nonverbally
[07:06:07] <brigand> if a tree falls in an empty forest, does it make a sound?
[07:06:30] <causative> depends on what you mean by "sound"
[07:06:42] <causative> it does not make a subjective experience of sound, but it does vibrate the air molecules rhythmically
[07:14:06] <brigand> are you an animist?
[07:14:27] <Player001> so the ball is a conscious subject?
[07:14:47] <causative> I am not an animist
[07:15:22] <causative> I am a panpsychist, but none of what I said is predicated on that
[07:15:52] <causative> Player001, language need not be between conscious subjects; if two computers speak to each other according to a protocol, is that not language?
[07:16:44] <causative> or if a programmer writes some C++, is he not communicating with his computer using a language?
[07:20:53] <Player001> my point was that we understand the ball falling in our experiment through the use of concepts given to us through human language
[07:21:55] <Player001> two computer exchanging information are also understood through concepts given to us through human language, as without it this process would be incomprehensible
[07:22:03] <causative> sure, as well as through the use of concepts *not* given to us through human language
[07:22:30] <Player001> no
[07:22:36] <causative> if a dog sees the falling ball, does this produce a concept in the dog's mind?
[07:23:56] <Player001> a dog precisely does not comprehend a ball falling
[07:24:04] <Player001> for the dog, a ball falling is just a ball falling
[07:24:45] <causative> is that not a form of comprehension?
[07:25:33] <causative> the dog might catch the ball and retrieve it. To do that he must have some understanding of its trajectory and what it is.
[07:25:57] <causative> or do you say the dog is not conscious at all?
[07:26:24] <Player001> the dog is not a subject
[07:26:45] <causative> can't agree with you there
[07:27:03] <causative> dogs have minds and subjective experiences
[07:27:49] <Player001> they might or might not
[07:28:10] <causative> most of what the human brain does is similar to what a dog's brain does
[07:28:13] <Player001> at any rate, something very different from our imaginary-symbolic consciousness
[07:28:21] <causative> it's only the relatively very recent parts of the human brain that are much different from a dog's brain
[07:28:25] <causative> the neocortex
[07:28:59] <causative> most of vision, in the brain, does not involve verbal language
[07:29:13] <causative> we do not express in words most of the things we see; we could express most of it, but usually we do not
[07:29:51] <causative> when a human sees and tracks a ball, the act of vision is approximately the same act of vision that a dog does when seeing and tracking the ball
[07:30:01] <causative> nonverbal, using the visual cortex
[07:30:23] <causative> the difference only comes when the human wants to talk about the ball, to himself or to others, which happens later if at all
[07:36:04] <Player001> at any rate I thought we were talking about science
[07:37:18] <Player001> at any rate the dog does not posses Understanding
[07:37:22] <Player001> *possess
[07:38:10] <Player001> so it cannot comprehend the concept of the ball's motion, its essence
[07:38:18] <Player001> it is only a this
[07:38:28] <causative> on what grounds do you claim the dog does not possess understanding?
[07:39:35] <causative> I say it does possess some level of understanding; it knows where the ball will go next, so that it can catch it. That's understanding.
[07:40:41] <causative> it doesn't understand as much about the ball as an average human, perhaps. And an average human doesn't understand as much about the ball as a physicist. And a physicist might not understand as much about the ball as a materials scientist.
[07:41:15] <causative> but the dog does understand where the ball will go next, and that's something
[07:41:40] *** Quits: llh (~llh@user/llh) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[07:44:20] <Player001> yes, sense-certainty
[07:45:10] <causative> the scientist studying how the ball falls, also has that understanding
[07:45:40] <causative> and nonverbally understands many other things about the ball, too:  how it looks, subjectively how fast it's going, what's around it
[07:45:57] <causative> he has a verbal understanding of the ball as well - he has both a nonverbal and a verbal understanding of it
[07:46:20] <causative> and he must use both in order to reason about the ball
[07:46:33] <causative> we do not think in a purely verbal way; our thinking is a marriage of verbal and nonverbal methods
[07:47:31] <causative> for example, the scientist may note that at a certain time the ball has passed a mark that he made. How does he judge whether the ball has passed the mark? Nonverbally, using his vision.
[07:48:12] <causative> this nonverbal thinking is an essential part of the scientific process
[07:53:10] <Player001> where exactly are you going with this?
[07:53:18] <Player001> you have not shown anything yet
[07:53:29] <causative> because you said
[07:53:29] <causative> <Player001> my point was that we understand the ball falling in our experiment through the use of concepts given to us through human language
[07:53:50] <causative> and I have established that we understand the ball falling through the use of language, *and* through non-verbal methods
[07:54:45] <Player001> no you haven't
[07:55:10] <causative> okay, well, if you disagree with something then go ahead and say what
[07:55:15] <Player001> you presuppose an understanding of concepts given through language
[07:56:22] <causative> in what way do I presuppose this, and what relevance does this presupposition have to the claim made?
[07:57:59] <causative> your unwillingness to answer my questions makes this process much slower than it has to be
[07:59:05] <causative> the only reason to be unwilling is if you think your views might not hold up under questioning
[07:59:44] <Player001> there is a point at which "questioning" becomes bad faith
[08:00:41] <causative> bullshit, none of my questions are bad faith
[08:00:54] <causative> it's bad faith to stonewall a question when you think the answer might be detrimental to your case
[08:01:10] <Player001> you think you are Socrates but you are much more like Gorgias
[08:01:29] <causative> you think you are debating but you are just committing ad hominems
[08:01:35] <Player001> the original question is about whether a ball "talks" to us
[08:02:09] <Player001> and this is completely irrelevant
[08:02:15] <Player001> and that is not what an ad hominem is
[08:02:39] <Player001> and the real original question wasn't even about balls talking
[08:02:43] <Player001> it was about science
[08:02:58] <causative> yes, that is exactly what an ad hominem is
[08:03:21] <Player001> no it isn't
[08:03:35] <causative> when you insult or disparage the person instead of their argument, that's an ad hominem
[08:03:47] <causative> comparing me to Gorgias is obviously meant as disparagement
[08:03:50] <Player001> there was no modus ponens so it can't be ad hominem

[08:10:01] <Player001> where someone is actually making an argument based on an undesirable characteristic of a person
[08:10:31] <causative> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem
[08:10:31] <ro-bot-o> [url] Ad hominem - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[08:10:38] <causative> "Typically this term refers to a rhetorical strategy where the speaker attacks the character, motive, or some other attribute of the person making an argument rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself"
[08:11:20] <causative> you see, it doesn't even have to be connected to the original argument at all
[08:11:26] <Player001> "A makes a claim x, B asserts that A holds a property that is unwelcome, and hence B concludes that argument x is wrong"
[08:11:28] <Player001> LOL
[08:11:53] <causative> that's prefaced in the article as "the most common form," don't quote incompletely
[08:12:34] <causative> the same paragraph, earlier, is what I quoted
[08:12:48] <causative> of which what you quoted is a particular special case, not the general form
[08:13:30] <causative> anyway. Insulting the other person while you're talking to them is bad, is "ad hominem," and deserves to be shunned
[08:13:47] <causative> it works at cross purposes to the mutual search for truth that an ideal discussion should be about
[08:14:11] <Player001> "Contrary to popular belief, merely insulting someone is not a fallacious ad hominem. A character attack is only considered a fallacious ad hominem if it is used in exchange for a genuine argument."
[08:14:58] <Player001> "Non-Fallacious: A makes an argument, B responds with "(Genuine refutation of A's argument), also you are a moron". While potentially childish, B has genuinely offered a response to A's argument and has just bolted on an insult. This is not a fallacy, as an insult or character attack was not exchanged for an argument; rather one was provided alongside of an argument."
[08:15:33] <causative> that's one particular author, not a universal view
[08:15:47] <causative> that's the view of douglas walton
[08:16:03] <causative> there are many other things called ad hominems that do not involve a specific formal fallacy
[08:16:21] <causative> for instance, "poisoning the well" is mentioned in the same article as ad hominem
[08:16:27] <Player001> well then it's just an insult r rather in this case a point of fact
[08:16:34] <Player001> *or
[08:16:39] <causative> and poisoning the well certainly does not make any overt conclusions
[08:16:50] <causative> just causes you to doubt whatever the person says next
[08:17:24] <Player001> I already doubt whatever you say next
[08:17:54] <causative> anyway, regardless of whether you want to call it an ad hominem, insulting the other person is very bad form and detrimental to a productive discussion seeking after the truth
[08:18:29] <causative> it degrades the tenor the discussion away from facts and reason, and towards personal attacks
[08:18:47] <causative> and the person who begins this should be recognized as arguing in bad faith and destroying the tenor the debate
[08:18:53] <causative> *destroying the tenor of the debate
[08:19:43] <Player001> So anyway, going back up to the original argument, science is always already social
[08:19:48] <Player001> science is a discourse

[09:12:25] <causative> we should trust systems of developing truth only to the extent that they have a clear, objective ways of eliminating falsehoods from their discourse. In the absence of these methods, people tend to believe whatever pleases them, with barely any relation to the facts.

[09:36:15] <causative> the concept of a formal proof connects the abstract to the physical

[09:39:37] <causative> I just told you how it's testable
[09:40:04] <causative> it's a necessary truth if you can write down - physically write down - how the conclusion formally follows from the premises
[09:40:13] <causative> being able to physically write it down is an empirical test
[09:41:35] <Player001> well it that case you have turtles all the way down situation

[09:47:55] <Player001> or rather not turtles all the way down
[09:48:06] <Player001> <causative> more generally, a claim that "T is a theorem of inference system S" is a claim that "it is possible to write down a sequence of lines of characters following the typographical rules of inference system S, such that T is the bottom line."
[09:48:25] <Player001> it is just that those two statements are not equivalent
[09:48:33] <Player001> the second certainly follows from the first though
[09:49:34] <causative> they are equivalent

[09:50:30] <causative> okay, now give an example of the second that is not an example of the first
[09:50:32] <Player001> i.e. there is a possible world where writing is impossible
[09:50:45] <causative> well, that depends on what you consider "possible"
[09:50:52] <causative> why should we consider worlds where writing is impossible to be possible?
[09:50:57] <causative> in this world, writing is possible
[09:51:10] <Player001> ok
[09:51:13] <causative> this world, being the only one that we have empirical access to
[09:51:16] <Player001> contingently though
[09:52:38] <Player001> it is certainly not a necessary truth that we are able to write
[09:53:24] <causative> we can state it more precisely then. "It is possible for there to exist a sequence of lines of characters following the typographical rules of inference system S, such that T is the bottom line."
[09:53:27] <causative> no need for writing
[09:54:30] <causative> where "possibility" here is interpreted as the set of configurations of matter allowed by the laws of physics in our current universe
[09:57:46] <causative> "T follows from S" <-> "a proof of T in S could physically exist."
[10:01:04] <Player001> what about unprovable truths?
[10:01:36] <causative> Godel sentences are "provable" according to the inscrutable system of inference implemented by the human brain
[10:02:10] <causative> this system of inference could in principle be implemented on a computer - by simulating a whole human brain if necessary
[10:02:11] <Player001> what do you mean by that
[10:02:32] <causative> I mean that if a human being agrees that a Godel sentence is true, then the Godel sentence is a result of his brain's system of inference
[10:02:58] <causative> it can be derived as a truth by his brain
[10:04:24] <causative> so, there aren't any unprovable truths that humans agree are true - although there are truths that are unprovable within a particular system
[10:05:06] <causative> perhaps I should reword. There aren't any truths that humans agree are true, that are unprovable in every method of reasoning humans accept.
[10:05:23] <causative> the fact that humans agree a truth is true, demonstrates that there is some method of reasoning by which the humans accept the truth.
[10:05:50] <Player001> So there are truths which humans would not be able to derive?
[10:06:02] <Player001> from their "logical hardware" as it were
[10:06:11] <causative> if there are truths that humans would not be able to derive, then humans would not agree they are truths
[10:06:25] <causative> and - yes there are
[10:06:40] <causative> because whatever system humans use to think, we could presumably write down a Godel sentence for it
[10:07:53] <causative> if we knew the details of how the system works
[10:08:22] <causative> although, by what method would we say such a Godel sentence is a truth?
[10:08:24] <Player001> this is actually close to Adrian Johnston's example of "I am dead" being necessarily false if uttered
[10:08:39] <Player001> or not close but just an observation
[10:08:52] <causative> I don't think it is very meaningful to talk about truths and falsehoods except in the context of what is derivable in some system of reasoning
[10:09:08] <causative> Godel sentences are meaningful only because we do have a system of reasoning in which they are derivable - our own
[10:10:00] <Player001> so for any finite system (brain, computer) using logic there are Godel sentences for this system?
[10:10:21] <Player001> roughly speaking
[10:10:24] <causative> yes
[10:10:38] <causative> as long as it's powerful enough to implement Peano arithmetic
[10:11:18] <Player001> so in every possible (finite) world, there are truths which could not be proved in that world, if all the matter were used to make a super-powered computer?
[10:12:11] <causative> if the world is finite, of course they cannot prove every truth, because some truths have formulas that are larger than the finite amount of stuff in the universe
[10:12:18] <causative> no need to invoke Godel sentences for that
[10:12:56] <causative> but if the formula is that long, perhaps it would not be meaningful in that universe
[10:13:11] <causative> certainly it wouldn't be testable
[10:14:51] <Player001> this seems to contradict "T follows from S" <-> "a proof of T in S could physically exist."
[10:15:13] <causative> only if the universe is finite
[10:15:17] <causative> which it need not be
[10:16:52] <Player001> ok
[10:17:45] <Player001> infinite universe, infinite matter, ignoring computer collapsing into black holes
[10:18:18] <Player001> for any finite computer it has an unprovable true statement
[10:18:43] <Player001> which might be able to be proved by a larger computer
[10:19:38] <Player001> this seems to generate a bad infinity, a kind of turtles all the way down
[10:20:19] <Player001> there is a deferment from one logic to the next bigger logic
[10:21:53] <causative> we already know that for any logic with a Godel sentence, you can write a bigger logic in which that Godel sentence is derivable

[12:18:09] <arryana> oh, you're my hero
[12:18:48] <arryana> there were tattie scones here, but I think the other half ate them
[12:19:09] <arryana> how's you, then
[12:20:08] <pussipupu> Slightly out of my mind at work but otherwise fine, yourself?
[12:20:34] <arryana> aww
[12:21:06] <arryana> mostly a quiet morning here, the girls scared all hell out of some linemen who are in a pole next to the garden

[12:23:37] <arryana> i'm totally stoked about that
[12:25:11] <pussipupu> Sounds like a blast, great
[12:25:23] <arryana> i hope it happens.  i worry about another lockdown.
[12:25:52] <pussipupu> Looks like health experts want one and BritGov doesn't
[12:25:53] <arryana> we've been optimistic enough to buy tickets for a few shows in the spring, we'll see
[12:25:56] <arryana> yeah
[12:26:05] <pussipupu> I don't know how devolved these decisions are though
[12:26:29] <pussipupu> It's looking to me like lockdown for Christmas again over in England
[12:26:39] <arryana> the sad part is, scotland is still requiring masks and such.  it's England that's behind
[12:26:49] <arryana> bleh, new machine forces capitalization.
[12:27:11] <arryana> scotland isn't doing great, but it's pretty much a stable flat line at the moment
[12:27:21] <arryana> england rates are going up
[12:27:52] <arryana> i'm a bit baffled by their refusal to recognize reality.  if the nhs is overwhelmed (again) things start falling apart fast.
[12:34:50] <arryana> food shortages are for sure a thing here
[12:35:07] <arryana> there were no spring onions at tesco two weeks running.
[12:35:16] <arryana> and that's true of quite a bit of produce
[12:36:17] <arcturus> people are consuming more food than ever before
[12:36:26] <arcturus> overeating in some cases
[12:36:51] <arryana> i find it hard to believe that binge eating accounts for the lack of produce in a large store
[12:37:27] <arcturus> the binge eaters cannot be underestimated
[12:37:44] <arryana> that's ridiculous.
[12:37:50] <pussipupu> Johnson rules by, and is ruled by, public relations
[12:37:55] <arryana> yeah
[12:38:08] <arryana> there are issues with both picking and shipping here, it isn't because 'people are eating more'

[12:44:02] <Jong> Hello.  I don't believe in god, but I'm looking for something that's similar to a prayer that will get my day started right, like an elegant passage in which I tell myself to be a good person, be positive, be productive, etc
[12:44:27] <Jong> Anyone know where I can find what I'm looking for?
[12:45:25] <Jong> When I stopped believing in religion, I also stopped praying. I miss the aspect of reminding myself of good values I want to follow through the day.
[12:46:51] <arryana> you want the comfort of religion without the discipline of following one.  sorry, can't help you.
[12:47:00] <arryana> it's the discipline that creates the calm.
[12:48:07] <Jong> comfort? Not if you mean comforting myself by fooling myself to believe in life after death and that sort of nonsense.  I'm talking about values happens to be found in religions
[12:48:39] <arryana> i mean comfort as in the peaceful mindset you're clearly trying to cultivate.
[12:48:50] <Jong> Religion uses the good in it (the values) to justify the bad in (the wrong values like no homosexuality). but that's for another discussion
[12:49:12] * arryana shrugs dismissively at that statement
[12:49:43] <Jong> arryana  I taped to the wall a paper stating "What would your life look like if you perform at your best every day?"
[12:49:53] <Jong> But I often forget to look at it when I need to
[12:50:38] <arryana> yeah, that sort of self-cheerleading doesn't really make sense to me, but if it works for you, more power to you.
[12:50:43] <Jong> arryana  I was thinking to memorize the scout oath.  It comes close to what I'm looking for.
[12:50:54] <arryana> i don't really require a peanut gallery of approval to take care of life.
[12:51:18] <Jong> "A Scout is Trustworthy, Loyal, Helpful, Friendly, Courteous, Kind, Obedient, Cheerful, Thrifty, Brave, Clean, and Reverent."
[12:51:24] <Jong> I'm sorry but it's hard to be all of that!
[12:51:58] * arryana shrugs
[12:52:10] <arryana> most of that happens if you just live a right life.
[12:54:06] <Jong> My life is exhausting. I'm looking for someone to clean the kitech and wash and iron my clothes, and wash my bed sheets for me. I want to focus on work, and the house work is bogging me down
[12:54:56] <arryana> can't cry tears of woe for you.  maintaining one's own life is just the reality.  thinking you're too above it and should be doing more elevated things with your time is rather arrogant.
[12:56:46] <Jong> arryana  do you think Elon Musk, Bill Gates, or Buffet do those house chores? I doubt it
[12:56:57] <Jong> I'm not saying I see myself as on their level
[12:56:59] <arryana> do you think you're elon musk, bill gates, or buffet?
[12:57:14] <arryana> then why are you comparing yourself to them?
[12:57:15] <Jong> I just preempted your question hehe
[12:57:26] <arryana> it's a pointless question if they aren't your peerts
[12:57:29] <arryana> -t
[12:58:01] <Jong> My point is that the same way they want to put all their effort into their professional work and not be bothered with the house work, I want that too.
[12:58:36] <arryana> you and everyone else.

[12:59:19] * arryana shrugs
[12:59:22] <arryana> i don't see the issue.
[12:59:53] <Jong> it's also a loss of money. If I way much more money doing X in an hour than doing Y in an hour, doing Y is akin to losing the X-Y dollars. (X is professional career; Y is house chores)
[13:00:06] <Jong> *make much more money

[13:01:03] <Jong> I appreciate your ideas
[13:01:03] <arryana> it's a hint. take it.
[13:01:45] <Jong> You must be a good philosopher
[13:01:55] * arryana rolls her eyes
[13:02:08] <arryana> using a subjective word like 'good', can't address that.
[13:02:33] <arryana> but clearly i have a level of contentment with my life that you're still looking for.
[13:03:06] <Jong> darn right I'm not content. I'll need to find a psychiatrist or two or three to talk it over with
[13:05:32] <arryana> that's one way to look at it.
[13:05:49] <arryana> if you need your hand held to get over yourself.  many people do.
[13:07:18] <arryana> don't you have friends and peers to talk to?
[13:09:40] <arryana> a better question is, how much of your time is spent helping other people
[13:10:56] <Jong> I haven't done volunteer work in years
[13:11:08] <Jong> I'm focused trying to help myself until I'm able to retire.
[13:11:13] <Jong> getting back to work!
[13:11:35] <arryana> there's your problem.
[13:12:59] <arryana> solipsism is an empty hole.  climb out.

[18:14:56] <pussipupu> Honestly adopting a teenager, let alone one from a rather different culture, sounds like an incredible challenge
[18:15:40] <darklambda> foster parents do that i think
[18:16:33] <pussipupu> The advert was specifically for adoption rather than fostering though
[18:16:56] <pussipupu> For either option, mad props to those up to the task
[18:17:48] <darklambda> what's the rationale for adopting a teen?
[18:18:16] <brigand> the same as for adopting any child
[18:18:23] <pussipupu> Children need looking after?
[18:18:29] <pussipupu> I might not understand the question
[18:21:06] <darklambda> children in some cultures age 12 and below
[18:22:13] <darklambda> what's the oldest age for adoption?
[18:22:53] <pussipupu> Dunno, I'd guess generally the same as the age of majority
[18:23:12] <pussipupu> Though in at least some places legal adoption of adults is a thing

[20:36:14] <JustLandedOnMars> "The biologists are a ruthless bunch, and quite devoid of any particular regard for doctors. In theory they don't even want a surgeon to patch up a man who has been hit on the head with a brick, the argument being that it is better for the human race to be able to dodge bricks. Which is a correct viewpoint, I suppose, unless it happens to be your head and your brick."
[20:36:19] <JustLandedOnMars> - Dr. Blake F. Donaldson, Strong Medicine

[20:49:29] <thunder> motive in the most general sense is just an impetus or force which compells it's object in a particular direction. the motive of natural selection is survival of the fittest. yet if we consider this in the human animal context, "the fittest" has lead us to have both reason and empathy, leading to the implication that in the grand scheme these are beneficial to our survival.
[20:51:14] <JustLandedOnMars> on the contrary there is another quote:
[20:51:17] <JustLandedOnMars> "Civilization is much more than the survival of the fittest and the unrelenting culling of the weakest members. Civilized people share a value system that extends far beyond doing whatever it takes to survive. Mere barbarians might be devoted to a life of exploitation. In contrast, civilized people value nature and care for the most vulnerable members of their kind."
[20:51:22] <JustLandedOnMars> -- Kilroy J. Oldster, Dead Toad Scrolls
[20:51:32] <JustLandedOnMars> so go figure, so many opinions
[20:53:07] <thunder> 1. civilization isn't natural selection. it's a cultural construct (albeit a widespread one in modern times). 2. survival of the fittest and caring for the land and people aren't mutually excusive.

[20:53:51] <thunder> it may be that "caring" is actually beneficial to survival of the fittest
[20:55:51] <thunder> you could refer to dogs as a non-humanocentric example. dogs have a hierarchical social structure with ostensibly "the fittest" serving as leader of the group. yet they will also risk their lives to save a pack member who's injured or in peril.

Some argue psychological capabilities (learning, social thinking and so forward) are products of natural selection. Would culture operate according to natural selection (probably not), but I also don't think sociology and biology should be as divorced as they are in the modern academy.
[21:35:50] <thunder> it's possible to make analogies between cultural evolution and physiological evolution. the question is whether the former is subservient to the latter. I'm not honestly sure, but it seems like something worth consideration.
[21:37:14] <thunder> the thing with physiological evolution is that it doesn't preclude maladaptive mutations. it's simply presumed that maladaption will lead to that organism's premature demise or failure to reproduce itself.

[21:51:47] <thunder> I'm just glancing here periodically in between math lessons
[21:51:58] <Atque> assan: You're not a post-structuralist then? Barthes would be sad.
[21:51:59] <assan> i see
[21:55:32] <thunder> I am mainly here to learn new things and gain new perspectives, as my academic knowledge of philosophy and it's jargon is rather limited. more specifically I have my own system of philosophy which I've developed over years, and am trying to determine how best to describe it in a way that will make sense and not cause too much cringing and furrowing of brows by those better educated than myself.
[21:56:02] <assan> i see
[21:56:08] <thunder> and/or new ways too look at the subject matter
[21:56:21] <assan> always ready to learn and improve
[21:56:50] <thunder> yep. doubt is custodian of truth
[21:58:06] <assan> for your philosophy what i see you telling humanity is how certain realities lead to other realities
[21:58:31] <assan> the interconnected nature of different realities
[21:58:44] <thunder> yeah. that's pretty much the underlying impetus.
[21:59:17] <thunder> but it's not necessarily because I set out with that in mind. it's more that is what has become clear as a consequence of the process.
[22:01:38] <assan> i don't like the word custodian you use that much, but you probably have a deeper connection to the idea as to why you choose custodian
[22:06:03] <thunder> my choice of words is just that, my choice. but there are synonyms you can use if you prefer another, like stewardship, etc. I like custodianship because it's root is custody, which seems like a good term to refer to the totality of sensation. steward on the other hand is also a reference to a scotish clan and I didn't like the idea of associating my concepts with a cultural identity.
[22:07:30] <wasd> doubt protects the truth?
[22:10:04] <thunder> on the interconnected nature of reality... for example, I spent some time meditating on the basic functionality of consciousness in the most general sense (as I experience it directly). that lead me to the types of sensations, which in turn lead me to the body as a category of sensation, and by extension it's experience of pain and pleasure. but similarly I was lead to the psyche as a category of sensations, and discovered that fear and desire and
[22:10:04] <thunder> the psychic analogues of pain and pleasure, but projected into another spacio-temporal context than the present. in that sense it's fair to say fear and desire are outgrowths of pain and pleasure. but I didn't set out to reach any such conclusion. it just naturally became clear through the process of identifying landmarks of experience and noticing they have obvious correlations.
[22:10:40] <thunder> wasd: think of the scientific method(s) or the roman legal precept of innocence until proven guilty
[22:15:18] <wasd> how does the fear / pain idea work for phobias, such as agoraphobia?

[22:19:11] <thunder> wasd: I don't have a fixed opinion on how things work. my approach is to simply observe what is, and try to discover what category of experience they fit within. this often leads to a bunch of precursors, such as the idea that fear and desire are psychic expressions of bodily pain and pleasure. to say how that works, is a can of worms because you could use potentially several different approaches from neuroscience to evolutionary biology and loads
[22:19:11] <thunder> besides and in between.
[22:20:32] <thunder> I suppose if you segregated all the "look at what philosophy I've invented" you'd end up with a schism resembling the divide between science and religion
[22:20:33] <wasd> "it's fair to say..." seemed like an opinion.  If the response to any challenge to a viewpoint is "I have no opinions", I can't see how any conversation could progress.
[22:20:54] <thunder> where religion in this case is a perpetual regurgitation of received tradition

[22:25:31] <thunder> science is great at describing patterns within observations, without necessarily favoring an opinion as to why those patterns are observed. to claim any such opinion prematurely is disingenuous.
[22:25:49] <thunder> my approach is similar in that respect
[22:25:55] <wasd> That doesn't seem like a question.
[22:26:29] <thunder> the question is how best to describe the patterns of observation. in this case the specific subject matter is consciousness as it's experienced directly.

[22:28:26] <thunder> I started off with the question "what are the nature and limits of consciousness?" base on the precept that one cannot accurately describe reality without first identifying the nature and limits of the tool used to do so.
[22:28:39] <thunder> but one question has lead to another as I work from general to specific
[22:29:02] <assan> you could propound a theory as possible sometimes but not necessarily the rule
[22:30:32] <thunder> anyway, I'm happy to discuss my philosophy if it's interesting, but I'm not really inclined to entertain antagonistic preconceptions about it.
[22:30:58] <thunder> assan: I agree. like general relativity vs quantum mechanics for example
[22:31:07] <arryana> does that mean you're only interested in talking about this if your opinion is taken as gospel?
[22:31:15] <arryana> pun intended
[22:31:27] <thunder> or ptolemaic geocentrism vs copernican heliocentism. both are accurate and descriptive, but one is simpler to do the math
[22:31:59] * assan smiles 
[22:32:09] <thunder> arryana: no. I'm simply not inclined to waste breath on people who are predisposed to scoff at what they're completely ignorant of in the first place.
[22:32:29] <arryana> you can't be serious
[22:32:42] <thunder> moreover as I've said, I'm here to learn, not quote gospels
[22:32:47] <wasd> I'm still stuck on the question to be honest.  so, conciousness is a tool used to describe reality which has 'a nature' and limits?  And, the question is, what is that nature and limits?
[22:32:52] <arryana> only a fool would accept a theory without considering it.
[22:33:18] <thunder> yeah. another way to put it is, what are it's features and characteristics
[22:33:37] <arryana> if you just want the approbations of people who are gullible and unthinking, you're going about it the right way
[22:33:44] <arryana> but it's a worthless thing to have
[22:33:59] <thunder> but the idea of acknowledging limits is important in the sense that the unknown exists. in that light, there are clearly limits of which we should be aware.
[22:34:02] <assan> i don't see any gospel in this philosophy, as the propounder has expressed his motive to investigate his observations further
[22:34:54] <wasd> Isn't there some massive assumption there already though.  "conciousness is a tool used to describe reality".  What does that even mean?  Why are they even connected / linked?
[22:36:14] <thunder> when you want to see a microscopic object, you look in a microscope, because our native human consciousness doesn't allow for that type of perception on it's own. we use an intermediary tool to bring those phenomena within the scope of our consciousness.
[22:36:35] <thunder> but ultimately when we attempt to describe any phenomena whatsoever, the indispensible prerequisite is consciousness.
[22:36:52] * arryana wanders off to where the air is less hot.
[22:37:08] <thunder> I choose to refer to it as a tool, because like a microscope which is ill suited to use as a telescope, it has it's limits.
[22:37:32] <assan> the examination here is how pain and pleasure is interrelated with fear and desire from my understanding of his example wasd

[22:45:09] <thunder> consider if you take your right hand and immerse it into hot water, and your left hand in cold water. then place both hands in room temperature water. the right hand will feel cold, and the left hand hot. is the room temperature water hot, cold or in between? what is the relationship between the objective temperature of the water, and how your consciousness represents it to you?

[23:08:57] <wasd> "in that sense your consciousness describes the water as hot or cold" - I don't think this is true either, I'm afraid.  This seems to get a little mixed up in experience / sensation and language.  I very much doubt my 'conciousness' speaks English.
[23:09:17] <thunder> yes. and even with describing observations, there are a multitude of preconceptions that have to be identified before one can be sure that the foundations of that knowledge are sound

[23:19:47] <assan> like all of science falls if flat earth is true

[23:20:03] <mannequin> no one seen something like this before
[23:20:08] <assan> its just proof we have been bamboozled
[23:20:09] <thunder> did you see the video of william shatner's flight on virgin galactic?
[23:20:16] <thunder> or blue origin
[23:20:31] <wasd> assan: do you think the earth is flat?!
[23:20:50] <assan> wasd i know the earth is flat
[23:21:05] <assan> i have proof for it wasd
[23:21:26] <mannequin> if you climb a high tower
[23:21:26] <assan> i can debate any professor and am sure he'll loose
[23:21:32] <mannequin> you can tell the curve of the land

[23:21:47] <mannequin> dude, ancient greeks knew the earth is a sphere
[23:22:00] <wasd> "proof"?  go on then....
[23:22:00] <assan> no i didn't thunder
[23:22:02] <mannequin> they made a clever thing to find out
[23:22:16] <mannequin> using distant obelisks
[23:22:32] <wasd> mannequin: hence my mention of eratosthenes above ;)
[23:22:35] <assan> so because ancient greeks thought it then it's valid?
[23:22:36] <mannequin> after that, their discovery was forgotten for milenias
[23:22:43] <thunder> wasd: in that link you shared above, the context was not whether the people perceived a colour or not, but instead how they categorize colours as a group. the colour itself is still prepresented to the person such that they are conscious of it. all which differs is the set of comparisons they choose.
[23:22:56] <defenestrator> christopher columbus remembered lol
[23:23:24] <assan> i said it already wasd
[23:23:29] <assan> scroll up
[23:23:55] <wasd> thunder: they are conscious of it but not aware to differentiate?  That makes no sense in terms of consciousness being awareness...
[23:24:30] <mannequin> are we devolving or am i not thinging straight

[23:26:48] <thunder> assan: have you ever tried using stellarium? it's astronomy software which calculates the stars in the sky at any time and/or location based on an algorithm consisting of the mathematical representation of known astrophysics. if you doubt that it works, try it, then if you're still in doubt, look at the code.
[23:27:18] <mannequin> i think we are feeding a troll
[23:27:40] <thunder> no. assan's alright. but some areas of his thinking aren't mainstream.
[23:28:03] <wasd> I can't believe someone is a real flat earther.  "I have proof"...."scroll up for proof" is somewhat troll like.
[23:28:11] <thunder> does there need to be an ideological purity test or some show of academic credentials in order to chat here?
[23:28:15] <wasd> Where's the "proof" assan?
[23:30:08] <mannequin> dogmas don't require proofs
[23:30:32] <wasd> thunder: I shouldn't expect so.  It certainly isn't in the rules for the channel, which would be a good place to check such a thing.

[23:31:00] <wasd> ##philosophy also welcomes discussions on a wider range of issues, as long as these issues are approached through the lens of reason, good-faith inquiry, and academic rigor (as opposed to polemics, partisanship, or dogmatism).
[23:31:14] <wasd> So, you know what you can do with your dogmas :)
[23:33:47] <assan> thunder why do i need stellarium to do what my eyes can do for me? or are you saying my eyes are not good enough? thunder
[23:34:33] <thunder> no. I'm saying that that software's algorithms provide evidence you can verify with your eyes which demonstrates that a spherical earth is consistent with astrophysics
[23:35:18] <assan> thunder is astrophysics the word of god?
[23:35:31] <thunder> if I'm not mistaken there's even a channel on libera for it in case you wanted to dive into the code to understand it better
[23:36:08] *** evolvidle is now known as evolv
[23:36:39] <assan> wasd my proof is the stars don't change, are you aware the stars that were there the day i was born is the same stars that are in the sky today?
[23:37:07] <thunder> what does god have to do with anything? (ps. that's rhetorical, since this is philosophy rather than theology)
[23:37:15] <wasd> assan: are all planets and satellites flat?
[23:37:49] <assan> thunder you are giving me something that proves globe earth instead of engaging on the exercise that disproves it
[23:38:38] <assan> in the flat earth, there are no planets and satellites would be impossible wasd
[23:39:02] <assan> in the flat earth we just have earth
[23:39:04] <wasd> so, what is the moon, that we landed on?
[23:39:19] <assan> and the luminaries revolving around the earth
[23:39:21] <mannequin> now we need to ask ourselves a fundamental question
[23:39:32] <assan> wasd nobody went to the moon
[23:39:33] <mannequin> why does it matter to any of us
[23:39:49] <assan> going to the moon is only possible on tv wasd
[23:40:02] <assan> that's why you were not on the crew
[23:40:07] <wasd> I knew it!
[23:40:09] <assan> that flew
[23:40:25] <thunder> geocentrism and heliocentrism are both fairly accurate descriptions of what we observe from the earth's surface. what differs is occam's razor. in other words, which is simplest to solve as an equation. since we also have einstein's relativity theory, we know that's really the practical demarcation of truth rather than some objectively fixed "center" around which things rotate.
[23:40:37] <defenestrator> you observation of motionless stars is mistaken assan. the stars move during the night. i saw with my own eyes lol
[23:40:51] <wasd> next you'll tell me the cow didn't really jump over it and the thing with the dish and the spoon was just rumour.
[23:40:58] <thunder> similarly, you can take the spherical earth, and place a dot on it's surface, then balance a plate centered on that dot. from the perspective of an observer, not much would change in relation to the heavens
[23:41:03] <assan> it matters mannequin, because as a scientist i have to be sure that the knowledge being thought by my master is true

[23:41:34] <assan> if my master is lieing to me then that threatens my experience on the earth
[23:41:43] *** Joins: arcturus (~arcturus@gateway/tor-sasl/arcturus)
[23:41:57] <assan> flat earth may not be where the gold is
[23:42:05] <assan> the question is
[23:42:18] <assan> if master is lieing about the shape of the earth
[23:42:29] <assan> what else is he lieing about
[23:42:46] <assan> like i actually paid dollars to learn this
[23:42:56] <mannequin> i'm fine with you beliving this, however it's really hard stuff to read
[23:42:56] <assan> its not even funny
[23:43:16] <wasd> you paid someone to tell you the earth is flat and now you can't let go of the idea because you paid for it?
[23:43:28] <wasd> or because it challenges other ideas from the same source?
[23:43:31] <assan> you are funny wasd
[23:43:47] <assan> i mean i paid to learn the earth is round
[23:44:00] <assan> flat earth is something i learnt for free
[23:44:31] <assan> so it's funny when you pay to learn a lie
[23:45:25] <wasd> I think you lost me at "the earth is flat" to be honest :D
[23:46:16] <wasd> "It's true because stars" wasn't very convincing either
[23:48:03] <wasd> have a look at Cleomedes and Eratosthenes.
[23:48:14] <wasd> and what they worked out
[23:48:50] <mannequin> compass is magic
[23:49:14] <wasd> or just look at that earth rise pic I linked above, taken from the moon, when people landed on it.
[23:51:33] <wasd> Is flat earth a religion, kind of thing?  some kind of anti science belief system?
[23:52:48] <wasd> so, there's no planets or moons but there are stars?  So, what are stars, in the flat earth theory?  pin pricks on the canvas of the gods or something?  It's almost norse myth level!
[23:53:03] <thunder> imagine balancing on a ball while looking up at the heavens. now imagine standing on a disk while looking up at the heavens. what changed about your observation of the heavens?
[23:53:58] *** Quits: wonko (~wjc@62.115.229.50) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[23:53:59] <wasd> why does that matter given mankind has already travelled to the moon and sent a few satellites out and around the solar system (with some awesome pics)
[23:54:54] <thunder> that was all created by kubrick in a movie studio don't ya know...
[23:55:03] * thunder smirks
[23:55:41] <thunder> his spirit still haunts youtube every time space-x or another company sends up a rocket
[23:55:51] <wasd> and equally, if I can use a tall stick to measure the shadow in several places, and from this, use geometry to calculate the circumference....?
[23:57:29] <wasd> so, we're left with the proof is "no planets or moons exist"?  kind of not a good proof :D
[23:58:59] <wasd> assan: who's the 'master'?  Did they tell you about the flat earth?
