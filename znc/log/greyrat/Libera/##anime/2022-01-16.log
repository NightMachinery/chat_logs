[07:29:40] <K0K1> hm
[07:29:44] <jbwncster> Sk8 the infinity
[07:29:49] <K0K1> komi cant communicate
[07:29:55] <emmeka> K0K1 anime "seasons" refer to the seasons of the year, Spring Summer Fall Winter
[07:30:27] <emmeka> and a "cour" is the number of episodes that fit in that roughly ~3 month run, about 12 episodes, but occasionally slightly more or less.
[07:30:58] <abacus> ijust ijust want something to watch :3
[07:31:34] <emmeka> abacus it's kind of a slow season, really. I'm liking My Dress Up Darling and ofc S3 of Takagi-san
[07:32:24] <abacus> o
[07:32:40] <MootPoot> should I code, exercise, grocery shop, or play piano
[07:33:20] <abacus> is there something new thats similar to higehiro?
[07:33:30] <abacus> that was a good one
[07:34:25] <jbwncster> There’s a new anime about cycling
[07:34:26] <emmeka> I mean both the shows I just mentioned are romantic comedies
[07:34:33] <emmeka> so give them a shot, I guess
[07:35:00] <abacus> I like romantic comedies
[07:35:01] <abacus> :3
[07:35:26] <abacus> also stuff that makes me wanna kill myself
[07:35:29] <abacus> like higehiro did
[07:35:33] <emmeka> I'm surprised Takagi-san got a S3, I thought the ending of the last one was a good stopping point. Not that I'm complaining.
[07:36:17] <emmeka> I didn't watch Higehiro because at some point I started the manga, before the anime aired, and so at this point I'm just gonna wait for the manga to be done and reread it all
[07:36:37] <abacus> oh won't say much about it then emmeka 
[07:36:42] <abacus> just gotta say it is REALLY good
[07:37:42] <emmeka> age gap romance isn't usually my thing but I'm game for any feels so I'll get around to it eventually

[11:40:19] <ButterNoodle> not like that

[11:40:50] <ButterNoodle> I mean...
[11:41:03] <ButterNoodle> you shouldnt use a knife to dig out a pimple on ur spine..

[11:42:32] <sentionics> ButterNoodle, it's like some pimples take as much work or more, as beating off does...

[12:17:47] <MootPoot> so I changed it to stream at 72hz auto

[12:18:17] <MootPoot> then I changed it back to what it was earlier ( 120hz manual res ) and it was still fucky

[12:19:29] <MootPoot> I am considering dropping down from 120hz at 3200x1632 to 90 or something with a higher res
[12:19:32] <MootPoot> I dont like the jaggies
[12:20:16] <MootPoot> and I only really play HL alyx and beat saber anyway so
[12:21:43] <Bco1981> i use msi afterburner every time. so i can see if the gpu use suddenly changes or the cpu use. for example lately after i changed beat saber desktop to 4K res i am some times experiencing lag in the headset. it would make sense that the fps would drop below 90... but noo... when i look at the recording the fps goes above 90... but in the headset it looks like lag.

[14:48:29] <Bco1981> 2nd, i would go with the msi because thay actually say what audio chip they use. and it's good.

[14:56:19] <Bco1981> no
[14:56:24] <Sadale> ah. not yet. not yet.
[14:56:32] <Bco1981> but what else would use pcie 5.0 ?
[14:56:39] <dfch> Msi no power related info
[14:57:02] <Sadale> dfch, let me check
[14:57:27] <Bco1981> it's on their picture presentations on the mobo page.
[14:57:49] <Sadale> dfch, 1x 24-pin ATX main power connector

[14:57:57] <dfch> Bco1981 not really, but who knows maybe in 10 years? Lol
[14:57:57] <Sadale> dfch, ^ MAG B660M MORTAR WIFI DDR4
[14:58:21] <Sadale> in 10 years you probably want to buy a new computer :P
[14:58:54] <dfch> Sadale, oh actually better than asus then ?
[14:59:08] <Sadale> dfch, lol the more the better? xD
[14:59:25] <Sadale> I have a hunch that you don't need dual 8-pin power connectors :P
[14:59:43] <Bco1981> 12900k maybe, but not 12400f :E

[15:01:35] <Sadale> dfch, up to you. I'm not into higher end PC market. :P
[15:01:59] <Sadale> dfch, oh, actually, just pick the more expensive one because you've got the money to burn. :P

[18:14:50] <isekaijin> Sadale: Spanish, of course, but they use it incorrectly.
[18:14:51] <Sadale> Did you mean that they can't speak Spanish at all, or they just speak Spanish with incorrect grammar?
[18:15:01] <Sadale> ah. That's not a problem as long as they're understood

[18:15:15] <Sadale> I mean Spanish does have convoluted grammar

[18:15:44] <MikeEcho> the lord has spoken
[18:15:53] <isekaijin> Sadale: Yes, but other languages have convoluted grammars, and somehow their native speakers speak them correctly.

[18:16:16] <Sadale> isekaijin, haha not me. I speak with wrong grammar in pretty much any language I can speak xD
[18:16:23] <amigojapan> Senti kind of, we are going to the ear nose and throat doctor on Tuesday
[18:16:31] <Sadale> I mean what's the problem? As long as it's understood it's fine :P

[18:17:40] <isekaijin> MikeEcho: Hopefully you don't mean it, but are you aware that those echoes are an anti-Semitic symbol?
[18:17:46] <Sadale> dfch, no thanks lest STD :3

[18:22:32] <sentionics> amigojapan, oh, tinnitus! that sucks! when I had that when I was suffering with new-daily-persistent-headache for 2 years (basically a 24/7 tension headache. pain sometimes was rough, sometimes just annoying).
[18:22:34] <soun> hold up my notification is not working lemme fix it real quick
[18:22:47] <Sadale> I've got arms sore, legs sore and butt sore xD

[18:25:14] <sentionics> Not a perfect analogy, but I'm not at my best.

[18:25:59] <amigojapan> Yeah sentionics 
[18:26:52] <sentionics> The problem with chronic suffering of this nature, there just isn't a proper cure. some treatments help some people, but... it's a dice roll to see if you are among those people.

[18:27:55] <sentionics> there's that word again, antisemitism. I saw it mentioned here not that long ago. oh. someone mused a word I said had a similar pronunciation.
[18:28:20] <soun> i think i have some *mild* tintinus but i think its so *mild* thats its almost normal but again i live in a tropical country where there is always some or other noise and when its completely quiet i REALLY feel the ringing. Also what are the chances statistically that someone has tintinus
[18:28:39] <sentionics> Sadale, ah, I'm ok. Other than being drunk. I used to be really bad off in terms of headaches.
[18:28:40] <amigojapan> sentionics: it means hate of Jews, antisemitism
[18:28:55] <Jigsy> I only notice ringing when it's really, really, really quiet.
[18:29:29] <amigojapan> soun: apparently it is very very common
[18:29:34] <sentionics> amigojapan, a very important friend of mine is part Jewish. Great guy, made a huge difference for me when I was really low.
