[02:02:28] <somiaj> yea sounds like it is for buster, but not bullseye.
[02:02:55] <somiaj> hmm, no not even seeing a package php-auth in buster.
[02:02:58] <PMT> that package was dropped in 2016.
[02:03:19] <somiaj> strange a guide from 2019 has that in it still, maybe just copy/pasted it and didn't try it out themselves
[02:04:11] <PMT> https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/php-auth says it's basically nowhere, now.

[02:04:20] <tjcarter> yeah I thought so
[02:04:55] <somiaj> or some derivative still ships it and that guide is not fully for debian, either way, worth a bug report against the guide
[02:05:49] <PMT> I thought libav more or less stopped getting maintained a few years ago. Last commit April 2019.

[10:25:11] <somiaj> resetting them can be done, but requires some special flags to dpkg, it would be better just to edit the files so any custom changes you want are still there

[10:26:28] <Khepra> you _really_ want sshd_config be set up mindfully and knowing what you're doing.
[10:26:48] <arash> but i should fix it.
[10:26:53] <somiaj> arash: you can use ssh -vvv user@host to get a better idea why you cannot connect.
[10:26:58] <arash> that is why i want to reset it to default settings
[10:27:01] <Khepra> (also serever side logs)
[10:27:22] <PMT> arash: why do you think it's a change in the server settings and not, say, wrong password/ssh key?
[10:27:40] <Khepra> arash: default settings are basically empty sshd_config. the package installs a documented one, but effectively nothing is enabled beside the default
[10:27:57] <jelly> arash, does /var/log/auth.log provide any clues to why a user is refused login?
[10:28:14] * Khepra looks if there's templates or examples in /usr/share/
[10:28:26] <jelly> arash, how does "ssh user@server" fail?  Can you show ssh -v user@server, just one -v for start?

[10:30:17] <Khepra> arash: did you reload the service after changing port?

[10:32:33] <jelly> arash, can you use the openssh client to gather info, not putty
[10:32:48] <PMT> putty also has its own event log you can read.
[10:33:03] <PMT> right-click the title bar of the window, event log
[10:33:07] <arash> well, there is nothing wrong when i try "ssh -vvv root@localhost", should i try that command from another server?
[10:33:10] <Khepra> google says "Log all session output" in its logging -> session config
[10:33:30] <Khepra> arash: wait, is that openssh-client or putty?
[10:33:49] <jelly> arash, do the try from the same client machine that failed before, if possible
[10:34:24] <PMT> arash: if you don't know why the other person made these changes, and the other person had permission to make these changes and wasn't someone breaking in, maybe ask them why they did it?

[10:38:46] <Khepra> welp if you have root access, whoever gave it to you, gave you the licences to change stuff, implicitly. if you break something, it IS your responsibility though
[10:39:03] <arash> Khepra, yes, i know that

[10:39:56] <Khepra> and as others have hinted at, changing the ssh port might break other things. how is this server used? any automated process connecting over ssh to it?

[10:40:20] <Khepra> ultimately, why do you want to change it to 22?  use 2201 (or what was it) from the client side to connect
[10:40:56] <arash> x11forwaring is yes, isn't that the problem?
[10:41:09] <Khepra> in itself, not for timing out port 2201
[10:41:12] <Khepra> *22
[10:41:24] <PMT> why would that be related
[10:42:06] <arash> how can i make sure port 22 is not blocked by firewall or something else?
[10:42:24] <Khepra> arash: but really, stop. are you sure there even is a problem? are you sure you want to revert the SSH port back to 22?
[10:43:15] <Khepra> why don't you try connecting to the server using port 2201 from the client side?      ssh-client has -p option (please check the manpage on how it's used).   putty also has the ability to specify port number
[10:44:13] <Khepra> that, however, would require you also to revert back to 2201 in sshd_config .   even moreso hilighting the $1M question: what EXACTLY is the problem?
[10:44:18] <arash> why not? is not matter, they using this server as http server, so i think changing the ssh port is not important, im testing anyway.
[10:44:35] <arash> i already tried that port, it failed.
[10:44:43] <Khepra> arash: because don't change existing configuration if there is no need for that
[10:44:52] <arash> i changed it because i guess maybe there is something wrong with that port
[10:44:59] <Khepra> it is common for servers to change their ssh ports from 22 to something else, to avoid the onslaught of bruteforce bots trying port 22
[10:45:01] <jelly> arash, how did it fail specifically?  Connection timed out?  Connection refused?
[10:45:09] <arash> then i thought it was needed

[10:45:24] <Khepra> arash: I would recommend you revert to how it was, port 2201, then use that port on the CLIENT side and THEN see what's wrong (password, key, something else)

[10:45:48] <Khepra> you obviously have a firewall somewhere dropping packets to 22, if you get a timeout for 22
[10:46:05] <jelly> arash, can you run "tcpdump -n port 22" on the ssh server and verify whether the traffic arrives at all?
[10:46:09] <jelly> same for 2201
[10:46:21] <Khepra> well...  "probably", not obviously. could be other reasons for timeout. those reasons might be clued in the server side auth.log, or journalctl -u ssh.service

[12:20:24] <jelly> dokma, show all the log lines for 4HJY863HSKz11N please (grep); that looks like a successful delivery to me.
[12:20:24] <dokma> So it behaves as if though my script is the delivery mechanism but all I wanted is to run this script when an e-mail arrives.
[12:20:44] <dokma> Will pastebin
[12:20:53] <jelly> also, output of "postconf -n" and "postconf -Mf"
[12:22:24] <dokma> This is the log for that delivery: https://pastebin.com/VvA2pn2C
[12:23:30] <jelly> that seems like you explicitely set the transport for that address to your new service.
[12:25:41] <dokma> I did. I thought it would just run the script as an additional processing on top of the normal delivery.
[12:25:47] <dokma> http://paste.debian.net/1213516/
[12:26:06] <dokma> http://paste.debian.net/1213517/
[12:28:34] <dokma> I thought a content_filter would just provide some additional filtering no?
[12:29:48] <jelly> content_filter works by getting mail via smtp, processing, and passing message back to postfix on a separate smtp service
[12:30:39] <jelly> you have effectively replaced your amavis with ured-notify
[12:30:48] <jelly> maybe don't do that :-)
[12:31:23] <Khepra> the script could be part of amavis config then. what does it do exactly? MPEG audio something something? text to speech?
[12:32:24] <Khepra> or maybe it's an audible "you have mail!" ping and I'm giving Tom Hanks too much credit.
[12:32:30] <dokma> It runs a notice for me via ssh
[12:32:50] <dokma> But seems like I misunderstood. I only wanted to add something on top of normal postfix delivery.
[12:33:01] <dokma> Not change normal delivery completely.
[12:33:25] <dokma> Khepra: exactly.
[12:33:39] <jelly> put master.cf back to what it was, you're losing mail right now
[12:33:51] <jelly> and reload postfix
[12:34:08] <dokma> I did
[12:34:29] <jelly> I would do this on MDA level, not content_filter.
[12:34:49] <dokma> How is that done?
[12:34:50] <jelly> however, I'm not sure dovecot can call external scripts via sieve
[12:35:07] <dokma> jelly: I've seen examples where it can do that
[12:35:09] <jelly> you seem to be using dovecot as delivery agent.
[12:35:15] <dokma> Yes.
[12:35:22] <dokma> Is Dovecot the way to go for this?
[12:35:57] <jelly> MDA is the way, and you seem to be using dovecot for MDA (virtual_maps & friends)
[12:36:13] <dokma> Yes, I use Dovecot.
[12:36:33] <jelly> if it was delivery with local(8) I'd say configure .forward for that user
[12:36:55] <dokma> It's not local.
[12:36:58] *** Quits: jmcgnh (~jmcgnh@wikipedia/jmcgnh) (Excess Flood)
[12:37:19] <jelly> dunno how to do it with dovecot and sieve but I'd search in that direction.  Ask in ##email, explain your goal
[12:37:33] <dokma> This is an ISPconfig setup with postfix and dovecot for virtual addresses.
[12:37:36] *** Quits: yetkind (~yetkind@user/yetkind) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[12:37:37] <Khepra> if you're using amavis for spam filtering, antivirus, this and that, then maybe this notification that otherwise should not interrupt processing, could be made from amavis
[12:37:46] <jelly> sure
[12:37:59] <dokma> jelly: I've already seen some tutor to do this via dovecot but I thought postfix was the way to go.
[12:38:10] <jelly> but a content_filter needs to pass mail THROUGH, not eat it.
[12:39:08] <Khepra> I'd do this the OTHER way around.  imap check and if there's something new, call tom hanks with "you've got mail!".   I _think_ there already exist tools for that for linux desktop integration, notify-send, zenity or whatever
[12:39:16] <jelly> eg. your current content filter, amavis, the flow goes internet -> postfix (:25) -> amavis (:10024) -> postfix (:10025, new message id!) -> delivery
[12:40:16] <jelly> amavis is configured to pass mail back to a separate postfix service; the service on 10025 is configured to not use content_filter any more.

[21:27:29] <jelly> you can do that with setxkbmap
[21:27:59] *** Joins: fatal (~0x00@user/fatal)
[21:28:09] <jelly> in fact you can add all setxkbmap options to /etc/default/keyboard and have them be active at boot
[21:28:24] <dokma> jelly: have any examples of that?
[21:28:24] <jelly> eg. mine:
[21:28:25] <jelly> XKBOPTIONS="lv3:ralt_switch,compose:menu,terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp"
[21:28:40] <dokma> will try that
[21:28:43] <dokma> thanks
[21:28:48] <jelly> compose:caps
[21:29:18] <jelly> !keymap
[21:29:19] <dpkg> Run "dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration" to change both your default console and X keymap; the setxkbmap utility can be used to adjust keymap settings during X operation.  For setting up X keymaps, see xkeycaps, xev and ask me about <multimedia keys>.
[21:29:20] <dokma> I already have that in XKBOPTIONS
[21:29:46] <dokma> I have XKBOPTIONS="compose:caps,terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp"

[21:52:48] <dpkg> This may or may not work for you, but if you've got nothing to lose then try it: (a) change sources.list (b) aptitude update (c) aptitude and then search for the upgraded packages, hit enter on them, select the correct version (d) do the same for libc6 (e) search for broken packages by pressing "b" and then fix them in the same way (f) once you have no more broken packages, hit 'g'.
