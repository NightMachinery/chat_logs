[03:14:33] <PanickedKernel> Hey all. I just got a new hdd(WD Red, 4TB) in my home "server"(old quard core intel + 8gig ram) and setup some docker stuff(all the "arr"', qBittorrent, nzbget, plex, etc) and I'm having some seriously slow issues. This is my first all docker setup as well as my first time using zfs.
[03:15:38] <PanickedKernel> For instance I have a download in nzbget that is about 20gigs that downloaded and nzbget is now repairing/unpacking. It's giving me a ETA for over 10 hours.
[03:16:07] <NeoThermic> oh. standard red? not red plus/red pro?
[03:16:54] <PanickedKernel> NeoThermic, Nein, just "red". I didn't do much research before hand and went with the red over the blue due to the red having a longer warranty.
[03:17:01] <PanickedKernel> Did I bone myself?
[03:17:14] * Myself shifts uncomfortably

[03:18:52] <PanickedKernel> I've done some reading and it seems that docker can slow things down as well as zfs being slower when torrenting/downloading lots of files since it's COW.
[03:18:55] <NeoThermic> PanickedKernel, yeah, reds under 8TB is SMR
[03:19:04] <NeoThermic> unless they're red plus

[03:20:26] <NeoThermic> yeah, older ones (~4+ years?) are probs CMR and fine

[03:21:25] <PanickedKernel> NeoThermic, Thanks for the link, just looking it over.
[03:21:56] <Myself> I solved the SMR mess by buying exclusively seagate and toshiba drives ever since WD doubled down on what I consider marketing fraud
[03:22:08] <PanickedKernel> Hmm, will smartmon tell me more?
[03:22:28] <rmmh> the ultimate anti-shucking measure: smr external drives
[03:22:31] <NeoThermic> the quickest way is the drive numbers
[03:23:16] <NeoThermic> Myself, Seagate are not immune from shitty SMR drives, but yeah. Ive sworn off seagate because I've NEVER had good drives from them
[03:23:18] <moo> Myself i'm still not over seagate's 2tb disks that failed on me, two at the same time
[03:24:05] <Myself> Seagate's never marked an SMR drive as NAS-ready, is all. Everyone makes SMR drives, but only WD lies about their applications.

[03:28:50] <NeoThermic> working out what the system is struggling with
[03:29:19] <PanickedKernel> System load isnt *too* bad.  Load average: 1.49 1.66 2.74
[03:29:33] <PanickedKernel> With nzbget being the top process
[03:29:48] <NeoThermic> iotop showing anything? htop showing swap in use?
[03:30:46] <PanickedKernel> NeoThermic, Yea htop is showing 3.08 out of 7.8G of real memory in use and 1.8G of swap
[03:31:21] <PanickedKernel> iotop is bursting up and down.  nzbget at the top.
[03:31:56] <PanickedKernel> ~7-9MB read and bursts of a few kb up to 15MB write
[03:32:11] <NeoThermic> hmmth
[03:32:31] <NeoThermic> I'd lower the swappness as 1.8G of swap when you still have over 50% RAM left isn't great

[03:40:37] <moo> its using rar isn't it?
[03:41:07] <PanickedKernel> NeoThermic, To be honest. I have no idea. I'm brand new to zfs. I basically added a hdd and create a zpool and started adding data to the drive lol
[03:41:51] <moo> try using a benchmark on the disk, instead of relying on this for real speed 
[03:42:12] <moo> that way you'll know if its hardware or not

[22:32:24] <evilgohan2> lol
[22:32:37] <evilgohan2> all these people doing pieces now on rising prices for gas in the USA
[22:32:51] <evilgohan2> as if, ten years ago, gas prices weren't even higher than they are now
[22:33:00] <evilgohan2> so y'all turned around from buying small fuel efficient cars
[22:33:29] <evilgohan2> to buying trucks and suvs everywhere to the point that some manufacturers literally don't even make cars anymore for the US Domestic Market
[22:34:12] <evilgohan2> and now you're complaining because you saw gas prices rise before, saw them drop a bit, and went and bought vehicles that don't even make 20mpg highway.
[22:34:14] <evilgohan2> and I'm just...
[22:34:19] * evilgohan2 facepalms
[22:35:09] <imMute> that's why my house has two cars.  an SUV for going up in the mountains and a small sedan for going to work and around town.
[22:35:14] <unfinity> ・ ​ ゜゜・。。・゜゜\_​o< QUACK​!
[22:35:19] <evilgohan2> ,bef
[22:35:20] <unfinity> Who knew ducks could be so picky? You can try again in 7 seconds.
[22:35:29] <evilgohan2> see: that makes sense tho
[22:36:08] <evilgohan2> Hell, I've considered a small SUV myself for carrying my gear when DJing - though that would mean it would get driven on average of twice a week.

[22:39:34] <imMute> evilgohan2: I'm definitely seeing a ton of SUVs around here too, but I'm near very popular mountains, so that probably skews it
