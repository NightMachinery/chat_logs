[00:34:55] <bookworm> yes, you need to run a non released version

[00:35:05] <jeremyrubin> ah that would make sense
[00:35:14] <jeremyrubin> i thought it was on the latest release but i spose not :)

[00:35:29] <jeremyrubin> for now, i shall ssh and grep
[00:35:38] <jeremyrubin> thanks for the quick response
[00:35:49] <bookworm> I mean the search is rather rudimentary, grep will still be more powerful for now
[00:36:04] <bookworm> it's a rather simple implementation to start with, which can be improved going forward
[00:36:22] <bookworm> (meaning we do simple string matching, no fancy regex nor can you jump to context)
[00:36:37] <jeremyrubin> cool, yeah. I have some feature ideas i might work on once there's some basics in place

[02:48:36] <MaxLeiter> I do agree with johncs though, the context menu isnt really built for mobile 
[02:49:14] <MaxLeiter> How often do you right click in channel list on mobile? I’ve rarely felt the need even on desktop
[02:49:17] <bookworm> why not? long click for context is all over the place on Android
[02:49:24] <bookworm> often, mute
[02:49:26] <MaxLeiter> (iOS doesnt support it)
[02:49:34] <bookworm> Android does
[02:49:56] <bookworm> in fact, you can also long click a nick to ban them etc
[02:49:56] <MaxLeiter> then whats your proposal for reordering the menu? 
[02:50:08] <bookworm> longer delay
[02:50:34] <bookworm> first try to open the context menu, if a user keeps holding start the reordering
[02:50:45] <MaxLeiter> Will the context menu not appear regardless?
[02:50:49] <bookworm> no
[02:50:55] <MaxLeiter> I dont believe TL implements the long hold
[02:51:30] <bookworm> what do you mean?
[02:51:34] <johncs> that'd be a pretty unusual interface, and I feel like pretty jarring to have the context menu come up and then dissappear
[02:51:38] <MaxLeiter> ^
[02:51:55] <johncs> we could implement the context menu via double tapping if you need the shortcut?
[02:52:01] <bookworm> no
[02:52:19] <bookworm> we HAVE long press for context on Android for gods sake
[02:52:24] <MaxLeiter> I think bookworm is against overriding the native interaction

[02:54:46] <bookworm> I mean, we could have a separate model for reordering
[02:54:53] <bookworm> modal*
[02:55:53] <johncs> A method that iOS's home screen uses is to long-touch to enter into a reordering mode and then the icons become draggable
[02:56:11] <johncs> Is that what you mean? But the icon in the corner is a button that enters into a reordering mode?
[02:56:56] <johncs> trying to download discord on my old android phone so I can take a look 😅
[02:56:58] <MaxLeiter> https://chat.maxleiter.com/uploads/70996720d4b27edd/image.png is what I think he's referencing 
[02:57:03] <bookworm> not really, as said it's not really applicable here. You asked how native apps do reordering
[02:57:07] <bookworm> yes
[02:58:07] <johncs> Ah I see, drag handles. Yeah we could put the list into a drag mode and bring up handles like that... almost got discord up so I can take a look at what they decided on at least
[02:58:52] <bookworm> I mean, I want to leave channels (well, close them, say whois channels) much more often than reordering them
[02:59:07] <bookworm> I tend to right click by long tap often for that
[02:59:28] <bookworm> saves switching to the channel first
[03:00:43] <johncs> Ah interesting, Discord activates a drag-and-drop and the context menu for a network in the same moment, and then only dismissed the context menu if you move the 
[03:00:48] <johncs> dragging item far enough
[03:01:07] <bookworm> sounds pretty much what I mentioned above :P
[03:01:08] <johncs> And then for channel reordering they just gave up and didn't implement it 😂, since the context menu for that is a modal
[03:01:40] <johncs> It does, and to my sensibilities does indeed feel quite jarring 😂. You know the android design patterns much better than I.
[03:02:18] <bookworm> can't really compare those, TL doesn't adhere to any of them
[03:02:25] <bookworm> else it would look like material
[03:02:54] <johncs> design as in ui design, which includes these sort of interactions
[03:04:55] <johncs> Well tbh the context menu thing really does feel pretty weird to me, but is definitely an option.

[03:05:36] <bookworm> o right, apple people also insist that there's only a single mouse button right /s *magic mouse*
[03:05:44] <bookworm> (no offense intended)
[03:05:51] <bookworm> just my humour
[03:06:10] <MaxLeiter> you can right click with two fingers, I do that often on desktop
[03:06:15] <johncs> But I could also make a button at the bottom of the list to start a reordering mode. Could make the channels wiggle if we'd like.
[03:06:16] <MaxLeiter> just haven't felt the need to trigger it on mobile very often
[03:06:49] <MaxLeiter> bottom of the list feels fairly hidden if theres many channels
[03:06:56] <johncs> Yeah... that's what i'm worried about too
[03:07:11] <johncs> Top feels too intrusive, and an icon in the tray feels a little cryptic
[03:07:21] <bookworm> indeed
[03:07:47] <bookworm> shove it in the context menu? reorder chans or something?
[03:07:56] <bookworm> might make that too crowded...
[03:08:15] <johncs> Also would be strange for iOS users because they're unlikely to think a long tap would open a menu
[03:08:18] <MaxLeiter> context menu is chan-specific 
[03:08:35] <MaxLeiter> so would be weird to appear in the vertical dots button

[03:09:43] <johncs> iOS doesn't emit one...
[03:10:00] <johncs> So I can stop suppressing it, let the context menu appear, and then as part of the drag hide any context menu that's visible
[03:10:22] <johncs> Android users retain their native functionality and things are moderately peachy
[03:10:42] <bookworm> can you delay the style adjustment a tad longer than the context?
[03:10:56] <bookworm> so that it doesn't flash the style if not needed?

[03:13:19] <MaxLeiter> I was referencing '...pretty jarring to have the context menu come up and then dissappear', but a user action causing it is 👍
[03:13:19] <bookworm> sounds like a compromise to me 🤷‍♂️
