[03:57:48] <Joanna> inky: I don’t support Putin I just want to know the truth about what is happening in Ukraine. As I’ve said before I believe all politicians are puppets taking orders from people who are really in control of what is happening. It does no good to cheer for or get angry at puppets. I was watching a documentary recently on Putin how he came into power right after some apartment bombings in Russia. The impression I have of Putin from 
[03:57:48] <Joanna> documentary is he follows orders but we shall see.
[04:01:37] <CalimeroTeknik> shorter summary (20mn) that can stand in for the aforementioned conference https://invidious.snopyta.org/watch?v=T6mw9U62ZJU
[04:03:58] <Joanna> As for good and evil that depends upon your perspective. If you are a colonial power or war profiteer or are related to them war is a good thing which is why there is no end to wars . As long as there are people who want there to be wars there WILL be wars!
[04:04:28] <Joanna> Thanks for link I’ll watch
[04:05:12] <CalimeroTeknik> best scenario, Zelenskyy accepts peace https://nitter.eu/BNONews/status/1500818064358748168
[04:08:47] <CalimeroTeknik> worst scenario, somehow he comes out on top, with a destroyed country, Kiev razed like Grozny, and there's some impressive demonstration of war tech by Russia, somewhere that will make the US incomfortable
[04:10:54] <CalimeroTeknik> middle scenario, everyone is broken from fighting and European countries wake up a bit, saying "maybe everyone could chill"
[04:14:38] <Joanna> I bet you that the reaction to the in incursion into Ukraine will cause more deaths outside Ukraine than inside Ukraine. They have used this as an pretext to reduce  the supply and raise cost of oil and natural gas. For countries like America this means the cost of fuel and everything that depends upon it will go up. All the food in the us with few exceptions relies upon growing stuff using fossil fuels for Fertilizer and machinery 
[04:14:38] <Joanna> and transporting it very long distances. So this could cause people to starve if they can’t pay for food pretty much. In addition to being stranded. Everything in the us was built with the expectation of being able to drive everywhere forever using cheap gas.

[04:47:52] <CalimeroTeknik> thing? 'war tech'?
[04:47:54] <Joanna> Not only that,  by kicking the Russians out of swift the US dollar will no longer be the dominant currency of the world
[04:48:11] <CalimeroTeknik> you know, Russia desperately needs more souls
[04:48:27] <CalimeroTeknik> they're not super intent on further denting their already declining population
[04:49:04] <Joanna> Suppose Russia creates a new system to replace swift and everyone who wants fuel has to use that instead of swift?
[04:49:33] <CalimeroTeknik> the peace offer over at https://nitter.eu/BNONews/status/1500818064358748168 is a really decent one
[04:49:50] <CalimeroTeknik> it glosses over the oil reserves and leaves most of them to Ukraine for developing its economy
[04:50:18] <CalimeroTeknik> that shows how much Putin is worried over the future of the larger UA / RU area
[04:50:54] <Joanna> Russia will probably put in a pro western government after this.
[04:51:28] <CalimeroTeknik> are you sure you said what you meant?
[04:51:55] <Joanna> About swift?
[04:51:59] <CalimeroTeknik> Russia pro western? I kind of doubt
[04:53:32] <Joanna> I said opposite:)
[04:53:34] <Joanna> Haha
[04:55:27] <Joanna> CalimeroTeknik: do you think nato will sacrifice Poland next by making it get into the war with Russians.?
[04:56:38] <CalimeroTeknik> I don't think there's a "next", at all, here
[04:57:10] <Joanna> If aircraft are sent from Poland to attack Russians Poland then Poland becomes part of the war
[04:59:17] <Joanna> That was a pretty good video you gave where it compared occupying countries to swallowing a porcupine:)

[17:12:13] <JimBuntu> Good morning!  Joanna, do you believe that you will ever actually know the truth about the Ukraine invasion?  I don't.  I don't think most people would even believe a truthful reason with stacks of evidence.  There is far too much distrust and a series of events like this require a multitude of causes, many with their own reasons.
[17:13:38] <JimBuntu> Trying to uncover reasonable explanations for smaller portions is probably as close as any of us will ever get.
[17:14:33] *** Joins: wwrrtt (~a5y17lte1@user/a5y17lte123)
[17:21:00] <Joanna> JimBuntu: we will probably never know all the details but I think we can see the big picture that some people got over confident about what they could get away with. It’s kind of troubling that they want to use this as an excuse to drag other countries into it and possibly cause a nuclear war with Russia.
[17:21:02] <JimBuntu> CalimeroTeknik The Russian demands are not decent.  The recognition of Crimea as being part of the Russian Federation is about the only one acceptable.  The constitutional amendment ruling out membership in any bloc is and should be a deal-breaker.  Russia wouldn't even follow that, and doesn't and is in fact based on the concept.
[17:21:50] <Joanna> Russia doesn’t want nato on its borders it’s similar to missiles in Cuba
[17:22:24] <JimBuntu> Joanna, they shifted from no NATO to no blocs at all.  Showing more of their true intentions.
[17:22:41] <Joanna> No blocs?
[17:23:09] <JimBuntu> Also, you can use the Cuba missile stuff all you want, it doesn't effect me at all. It will not mean you win a debate as I don't think a nation has the right to fight that kind of thing.
[17:23:32] <JimBuntu> Joanna, no treaties or agreements with other countries or organizations... no EU, no UN, no NATO... nothing of the sort.
[17:24:00] <Joanna> I do believe a nation should not allow it’s neighbor to point nuclear missiles at it.
[17:24:35] <JimBuntu> See, that's a serious issue.  Point YOUR missiles wherever you want on YOUR SOVERIEGN LAND... that's the point to being sovereign
[17:25:06] <Joanna> Well missiles too close are impossible to defend against.
[17:25:22] <JimBuntu> I don't see how that matters or how it's even true.
[17:25:51] <JimBuntu> soveriegn is soveriegn is soveriegn.  One nation does not get to control another, period.
[17:26:13] <JimBuntu> please ignore my spelling, I seem to always spell that wrong
[17:26:20] <Joanna> I don’t know about the no blocs thing are you saying they want to get rid of eu and nato and un?
[17:26:39] <JimBuntu> Joanna, it was in the offering to end the war. Please read it.
[17:27:50] <Joanna> I have nothing against the idea of every country being sovereign and free from interference but you will need a strong military to enforce that :)
[17:28:17] <JimBuntu> Oh yes  you do. You don't notice it though. You said "I do believe a nation should not allow it’s neighbor to point nuclear missiles at it."
[17:30:06] <Joanna> According to Scott Ritter Ukraine is currently a client state of the us with a president who is terrified of the neonazis who have threatened to kill him if he doesn’t do as told.
[17:31:10] <JimBuntu> odd that you trust a UN anti-weapons person, but ok.
[17:32:16] <Joanna> Have you ever listened to what he says ? I don’t trust any of these people but what he says seems to make sense.
[17:32:51] <JimBuntu> I have seen his writings.
[17:33:00] <Joanna> JimBuntu: what do you think the outcome of all this will be?
[17:33:27] <Joanna> America is going to boycott russian oil ?
[17:34:30] <JimBuntu> Long term?  A further destruction to oil/gas/fossil fuel demand... probably other such things as well.  Huge issues with production that is used to buying metals (and other resources) from Russia/Ukraine and several other nearby places.  Russia will strengthen it's hold in Crimea and D&L.
[17:35:46] <Joanna> Crimea is their naval base I don’t expect they would relinquish that.
[17:35:48] <JimBuntu> Joanna, American companies already started boycotting Russian oil and the gov will do the same.  That has only a tiny bit of direct impact. The US used almost no Russian oil last year anyway and previous years lately used very little.  The boycott of oil will impact the global economy though as more and more countries follow suit, driving up the price overall
[17:36:20] <JimBuntu> Wheat and other food crops will be an issue, that's already happening... since Russia is #1 exporter and Ukrain was #4/5... globally
[17:36:32] <Joanna> Where does the oil come from Saudi Arabia?
[17:36:35] *** Joins: s1gyn (~s1gyn@user/s1gyn)
[17:36:56] <JimBuntu> The US has tons of oil operations.  It's not all imports
[17:37:21] <Joanna> Unless the war is finished soon it will probably be hard for farmers to plant and sell their crops there
[17:37:32] <JimBuntu> Joanna, the US imported as much oil from Russia a few years ago as from Norway, for an example... something like 90,000 barrels I think (iirc), tiny
[17:38:04] <JimBuntu> Joanna, Russia and Ukraine account for about 25% of the wheat exports globally.  I don't remember the exact about, but about 25%
[17:38:33] <Joanna> Do you think all this chaos is part of the great reset agenda?
[17:38:45] <JimBuntu> Check out various metals and minerals though, more damage being done there or will be soon
[17:39:12] <JimBuntu> The great reset concept is far too great of a thing, with too many self-centered actors for me to comment on
[17:39:33] <Joanna> JimBuntu: what do you think of Putin ? Do you think he is top dog or just a puppet?
[17:39:52] <JimBuntu> Outside of a proper and transparent dictatorship, they are all puppets
[17:40:13] <JimBuntu> This is not new, it's always been this way... even the Kings and Queens
[17:40:25] <Joanna> Who do you think tells Putin what to do?
[17:40:56] <JimBuntu> I figure a lot of people buy ear time with him, and even more buy ear time with his advisors and aides.
[17:41:46] <Joanna> Could he be an Anglo American asset like Hitler was?
[17:42:09] <JimBuntu> Anglo, lol, the Anglo's are long dead... just like the illuminati.
[17:42:45] <Joanna> Anglo as in England
[17:43:03] <JimBuntu> You shouldn't use that term like that, the Anglo are a group... and it's not the English.
[17:43:50] <Joanna> Well I meant English and Americans
[17:44:34] <JimBuntu> I try not to think of these things as strict hierarchy, where someone says 'do this' and it happens on their time frame.  Anything this massive has too many moving parts for that.  Large actions take a ton of planning and then waiting for smaller things to fall into place.
[17:46:04] <JimBuntu> Joanna, are you familiar with the TV series named 'Big Brother' ?  Try to think of each politician as a member in that household.  Sure, there are behind the camera people making moves too, but it can be hard to predetermine the outcome.
[17:46:10] <Joanna> So a group of interests are working towards an agenda? The situation in Georgia was same as Ukraine and it didn’t escalate like this.
[17:47:21] <Joanna> I don’t watch tv much but I’ve read 1984
[17:47:28] <JimBuntu> I think there are lots of groups, with their own agendas and there is overlap.  Perhaps, maybe, but only maybe, there are a few groups kind of at the top.
[17:47:56] <Joanna> Are they still pushing the Covid stuff there?
[17:48:18] <JimBuntu> I don't watch it either, but I'm familiar enough with a TV show that's been around for 22+ years to use it as an example.  That's fine, you can get a gist of it from talking to people or online.
[17:49:01] <Joanna> Has Covid been forgotten now that they have a war to promote?
[17:49:06] <JimBuntu> Yes, sars-cov-2 is still in the news daily and still discussed in personal interactions quite a bit.  When I get out, I still see ~20% of people masked.
[17:49:42] <Joanna> So they talk about both Ukraine and Covid
[17:50:21] <JimBuntu> That's what I hear when out and about
[17:50:38] <Joanna> Apparently there was a bioweapon lab in Ukraine somewhere I wonder if Russians have found it.
[17:55:19] <Joanna> JimBuntu: are they still trying to do the vaccine passports thing? I heard they are making laws while people are distracted by Ukraine
[17:57:33] <CalimeroTeknik> JimBuntu, morally I agree with you, but I'd rather think of the situation in utilitarian terms
[18:00:46] <Joanna> CalimeroTeknik: how?
[18:01:29] <CalimeroTeknik> how to be utilitarian here?
[18:02:18] <Joanna> CalimeroTeknik: what do you think will happen with Ukraine?

[18:05:35] <CalimeroTeknik> mine will say "Zelenskyy, go negociate"
[18:05:52] <CalimeroTeknik> you probably understand what outcome that attempts to achieve
[18:06:31] <CalimeroTeknik> and if I don't have friends, then protracted war
