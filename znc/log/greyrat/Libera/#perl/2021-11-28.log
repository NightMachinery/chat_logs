[07:47:15] <rbraun> the 4-clause BSD license is also just an incredible fucking compliance nuisance in the real world, especially when there are many contributors
[07:47:53] <daemon> rbraun, just seems closest to what I want
[07:48:13] <daemon> its not even an exact match
[07:48:35] <daemon> I just want it that any company that makes millions with my work to pay their dues
[07:48:43] <rbraun> i forget if netbsd ever finally abandoned the 4th clause, but they used to have a 10-page text notice with contributors' notices in it that had to be included in any manual
[07:49:07] <rbraun> daemon: you probably want a copyleft license then, instead
[07:49:32] <daemon> rbraun, I want everyone to be free to use it, up until their product makes over 1 million in profit, then they have to pay
[07:49:46] <rbraun> the only way you get "dues" from a company with the 4-clause BSD license is that actual compliance is so obnoxious that they might pay you to use a different license instead
[07:49:59] <daemon> well yeah that was the idea
[07:50:12] <rbraun> lol... or they might just not use your code, since it is so nonstandard nowadays that legal depts just won't like it

[07:52:05] <Adura> Sounds like one of those video game engine licenses.
[07:52:23] <daemon> I know nothing about law or licenses >.> so no idea if that is true or not :P
[07:53:13] <daemon> I figure the BSD 4-clause does that, because <big company> is not going to want to advertise my name
[07:53:19] <daemon> easier to pay me for a private version

[21:50:46] <daemon> Here is a nice theoretical one for everyone, lets say you have a load of perl processes that are all chatting to each using mojo and websockets, and you want people to be able to join the fun with other langauges, so you need a handoff - so being an old school ass you want to use FIFO queues, that is the perl process handles the network quotient but when a request that should be handled by thatprocess is receieved it puts it SOMEWHERE, where 
[21:50:46] <daemon> another process can read it and respond
[21:50:54] <daemon> so redis comes to mind
[21:50:58] <daemon> but redis is NOT a fifo queue
[21:51:02] *** Quits: deadmarshal (~deadmarsh@95.38.228.7) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[21:51:12] <daemon> is there some kind of multi os APO droven fifo queue

[21:53:08] <daemon> yeah I just spotted LPOP
