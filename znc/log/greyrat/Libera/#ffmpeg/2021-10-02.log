[00:00:05] <furq> sure it's a selling point
[00:00:09] <furq> major seems a bit much though
[00:00:29] <furq> but either way it seems they're sticking with it on servers
[00:00:38] <BtbN> I only work with HPC, so I can only report from my perspective that AVX-512 is the only reason anyone in the segment still buys Intel.
[00:00:48] <BtbN> Why would they not stick with it?
[00:00:57] <BtbN> Never heard anything about it being deprecated in any way
[00:01:04] <furq> don't ask me i didn't say they were deprecating it
[00:01:12] <furq> that article suggests they're dropping it for consumer chips
[00:01:18] <furq> which probably doesn't make much difference to anyone's life
[00:01:19] <BtbN> Consumer Chips never had it?
[00:02:09] <BtbN> They are deactivating it on the big-cores of Alder Lake, which do have it in silicon, but the little cores don't, and incompatible micro archs on different cores would be... a bit problematic
[00:02:13] <furq> a few did

[00:05:21] <furq> i thought it was more widespread but i guess it was only skylake x
[00:06:21] <furq> well in that case if it was only really on xeons to start with then i guess it is a major selling point
[00:06:24] <BtbN> It's HUGE (physically) and uses a ton of power
[00:06:29] <BtbN> not really fit for the small consumer dies

[00:14:56] <BtbN> Whatever is more important for you is what makes the decision
[00:15:23] <aphysically> softworkz: I guess if we're going to keep the rendering pipeline separate for the types of subtitles, it sort of annoys me that there's no ffprobe-public way to know what kind of rendering methods the subtitle supports
[00:15:50] <aphysically> some support text, some support image, and a few support both, but there's no way to query what you should use except to maintain yourself a list of what is valid with what (i.e. hard code it)
[00:16:34] <softworkz> which format supports both?
[00:16:53] <aphysically> dvb_teletext

[00:19:13] <softworkz> I'll take a look, haven't used that one other than a few  tests
[00:19:37] <aphysically> but if we're keeping the rendering separate it might be worth exploring adding a subtitle attribute to ffprobe that let's us figure it out?

[00:21:37] <aphysically> dvb_teletext is the only one I have written down as supporting both rendering types, but I'm not certain it's the only one
[00:22:15] <softworkz> It's in AVCodecDescriptor.props
[00:22:35] <aphysically> so then we would just have to expose it with ffprobe, right?
[00:24:12] <softworkz> yes
[00:25:46] <aphysically> dvb_teletext doesn't even have a prop listed lol
[00:26:38] <softworkz> @aphysically,  so then we would just have to expose it with ffprobe, right? => Like already done in my patchset :-)
[00:26:45] <softworkz> btw
[00:26:48] <aphysically> oh! I didn't know
[00:26:58] <aphysically> great
[00:27:12] <softworkz> The patch title is: fftools/play,probe: Adjust for subtitle changes
[00:27:44] <aphysically> I wonder if dvb_teletext doesn't have a prop listed *because* it supports both and there wasn't a better way to deal with it at the time
[00:28:21] <softworkz> idk, I'll make some tests soon
[00:28:37] <softworkz> btw, it's already present in current ffprobe output
[00:28:47] <softworkz> as "format"

[00:43:58] <aphysically> oh, well that isn't more useful than a whitelist really
[00:44:15] <softworkz> too unrelated for my current patchset...
[00:44:24] <eldo> I currently have an dual output hls target using the tee filter. I'm trying to add a full url as pare ot hls_base_url, but it errors out on the colon in https. I've tried quotes, backslash, and $'72' to try and get the literal : in the base url but nothing seems to work.
[00:44:32] <aphysically> I could specify read_intervals to ffprobe to try to speed it up, but who knows if I'd catch the interval where there's a subtitle frame
[00:44:33] <eldo> Is there something straight forward that I'm missing?
[00:44:54] <aphysically> but yeah a whitelist is going to be better than introducing a 5 minute delay just to figure out if it's pic or text subs :D
[00:45:04] <softworkz> correct
[00:46:08] <aphysically> looks like 5 minutes might be pretty conservative for some of these pic subs
[00:46:19] <aphysically> I guess I only need ffprobe -v 0 -show_entries subtitle=format -select_streams s:0 anyway
[00:46:52] <softworkz> as long as there's just a single subtitle stream...
[00:47:38] <aphysically> I already have code that lets user select the subtitle stream anyway so I know a stream selector in advance

[19:07:44] <dev10> Hi guys. I was wondering if there is a set of test files available somewhere that includes a few examples of each format supported by FFmpeg? There are many legacy formats supported, e.g. old Amiga video formats, and I have problems finding examples of all of them.

[23:14:19] <stemid> hey can I show text for a few seconds and then disappear it in a video? I've used drawtext before but never figured out how to set a time for the text to disappear.
[23:15:14] <stemid> one of the examples in docs is " Show text for 1 second every 3 seconds: " but it's too complex for me to understand.
[23:15:29] <furq> stemid: https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#Timeline-editing
[23:15:50] <stemid> yeah enable is what this example uses drawtext="fontfile=FreeSerif.ttf:fontcolor=white:x=100:y=x/dar:enable=lt(mod(t\,3)\,1):text='blink'"
[23:16:03] <stemid> lt is less than I guess. but mod, I failed math.
[23:16:26] <furq> if you just want it to appear once then enable=between(t,12,34)
