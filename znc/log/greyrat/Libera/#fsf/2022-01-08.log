[02:45:34] <isf> :)
[02:45:47] <Noisytoot> "Secure" means that it is not broken.
[02:45:57] <isf> for you
[02:46:01] <isf> no for me

[02:46:19] <isf> or can be broken
[02:46:23] <isf> that for me is weak

[02:47:45] <Noisytoot> Read the issue. They did show how it is broken.
[02:47:48] <isf> becouse for me secure isnt the same for u
[02:47:49] <Noisytoot> The definition of "secure" that applies in this case is probably "Free from the risk of eavesdropping, interception or discovery; secret." (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/secure#English)
[02:48:06] <isf> that is the english meaning
[02:48:07] <isf> of secure
[02:48:10] <isf> for me is different
[02:48:33] <isf> in the old times inoculation was inmoral act now the dictionary say something different
[02:48:35] <isf> they change it
[02:48:46] <isf> so, dude i have other opinion
[02:48:51] <isf> thats all
[02:49:01] <isf> for me is secure becouse work good for me
[02:49:11] <isf> is secure becouse is sfree software
[02:49:21] <Noisytoot> I am speaking English so that's the definition of secure I'm using.
[02:49:22] <isf> so, the community can fix it
[02:49:30] <isf> so, 
[02:49:35] <isf> dont try to change my mind

[14:59:33] <leah> not that page itself, but cover the same thing it covers
[14:59:53] <leah> there's a bill proposed right now in the new hampshire state legislature in the US
[15:00:31] <leah> this bill, if passed, would more or less mandate exclusive use of free software, whenever possible, by the state, and facilitate its greater use by the public. it could also later lead to free software being taught in schools, and used extensively
[15:00:55] <leah> it could be a really good thing for everyone, especially if more states, and then countries (outside the US) follow
[15:01:12] <leah> i think the fsf should cover the news, on its website
[15:01:29] <leah> encourage people near/in new hampshire to attend to reading of the bill, and voice their support of it
[15:02:02] <leah> just putting this in here. please consider it. it's important

[16:38:47] <DiffieHellman> coodre: It should only matter during bootup, as an ideal BIOS loads up the kernel and then stops executing. But, BIOS's like to stick around and get called to for functionality, so a proprietary BIOS means a proprietary program that you're using anytime the computer is on.

[16:40:02] <potatoxel[m]> <viivien> ""secure" is not precise enough..." <- DRM can also be "secure", for some reason companies use the word secure now to mean also secure against the user.
[16:40:29] <potatoxel[m]> by user i mean the hardware owner and user of that hardware being the same person
[16:40:33] <viivien> cf secure boot
[16:40:53] <DiffieHellman> Thinkpads are the best laptops for libreboot, but there's kinda stability problems as Intel couldn't be bothered producing a reasonably stable micode on release. Certains AMD processors and boards are very stable under librebot though.

[16:43:13] <DiffieHellman> potatoxel[m]: Digitial handcuffs can't ever be secure against the user, as you can't give a user a key to decrypt something while also making that key unable to decrypt that something for unwanted usage (i.e. lawful backups) - but they can be secure in the sense of securely taking the users freedom.
[16:43:56] <potatoxel[m]> DiffieHellman: well 'security'
[16:45:50] <DiffieHellman> The usage and even the cracking of DRM systems results in no security being broken, as the user is using a provided key to peform decryption.
[16:46:57] <potatoxel[m]> i read doc where they call it security
[16:46:58] <DiffieHellman> Breaking DRM is really just working around heavy obfuscation.
[16:47:36] <DiffieHellman> A lot of information online is actually quite incorrect - you need to think carefully about what you're reading.

[16:50:06] <DiffieHellman> Yep, these proprietary companies love calling downgrades "upgrades".
[16:50:38] <potatoxel[m]> they call not being able to downgrade "security"
[16:50:52] <DiffieHellman> Yup.

[23:37:44] <jacobk> RE: SOFTWARE Act
[23:37:44] <jacobk> Wouldn't the bill apply to public schools aleady? It even specifically mentions "completion of coursework by school students".
[23:37:44] <jacobk> I can't go in-person (and I don't live in New Hampshire, if that matters), but if lots of examples of where the bill would have helped are warranted, then I could share in a written testimony how my school currently requires me to fill out Qualtrics surveys with reCAPTCHA v3 on them, if that would help.
