[05:08:43] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Shadow remembers only two things: his name and his attempt to escape the space colony ARK with his creator's granddaughter Maria, who was killed by G.U.N. soldiers.[14] Having walked through a room filled with androids that looked like him during the events of Sonic Heroes, Shadow wonders if he too is an android.[12]...Black Doom uses Chaos Control, enhanced by the power
[05:08:43] <feepbot> of all seven Chaos Emeralds, to bring the Black Comet to the Earth's surface. Black Doom explains that the Black Arms intend to use humans as an energy source,[20] and the Black Comet begins to release a nerve gas into the Earth's atmosphere that causes total paralysis in those who inhale it.[21][22] Shadow confronts Black Doom after the "Last Way" level, where he discovers that
[05:08:43] <feepbot> Professor Gerald Robotnik created the ARK's Eclipse Cannon weapon to destroy the Black Comet.[23] During their confrontation, Black Doom reveals that Shadow was created using his blood,[24] and he attempts to use mind control on Shadow, but fails.[25] Black Doom then transforms into a giant beasties form called Devil Doom;[26] in response, Shadow uses the Chaos Emeralds to
[05:08:48] <feepbot> transform into Super Shadow and confronts Devil Doom. During the battle, Doctor Eggman confirms to Shadow that he is the original and not an android.[27] Shadow defeats Devil Doom[28] and uses Chaos Control to teleport the Black Comet back into Earth's orbit, where he obliterates it using the Eclipse Cannon.[29] His friends are elated,[30] as are people at G.U.N. headquarters.[31]
[05:08:48] <feepbot> Shadow is then shown in the ARK's control room holding up a photograph of Maria and Gerald. Recalling Maria's last words to him, "Goodbye forever... Shadow the Hedgehog", Shadow discards the photograph and walks away.[32]' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_the_Hedgehog_(video_game)#Plot jesus. I just wanna go fast

[09:31:48] <shawwwn> then the conv2d function will automagically get the proper indexed weight

[09:36:46] <nshepperd2> it probably wouldn't even work at all, because the thing is so complicated and irregular

[10:27:49] <shawwwn> ok
[10:28:24] <shawwwn> set the default gcp project to gpt-2-15b-poetry and then do `pu list`. you should see TPUs
[10:28:36] <shawwwn> or you can pass in `-p gpt-2-15b-poetry` to pu commands
[10:29:01] <shawwwn> https://gist.github.com/shawwn/17c9b1249d4e3217eada83ac14401a47 is a writeup of how to do things using `pu` for TPU VMs

[10:30:14] <shawwwn> I recommend just doing `pu create 10+` and then `pu ssh 10`
[10:30:46] <shawwwn> oh
[10:31:04] <shawwwn> don't do that, because you'll get a preemptible TPU, which wipes your shit after 24h. it's annoying
[10:31:14] <shawwwn> do `pu create -a v3-8 -np`
[10:31:29] <shawwwn> oh wait
[10:31:32] <shawwwn> you do need to test on a v2-8
[10:31:43] <shawwwn> bahh let me add you to the other project that has non-preemptible TPU v2-8's
[10:31:52] <shawwwn> but you can use this one too
[10:31:52] <nshepperd2> i've already determined that diffusion works on v3-8
[10:32:03] <shawwwn> yeah I'll get you a non-preemptible v2-8
[10:32:07] <nshepperd2> v2-8 i haven't tried
[10:33:12] <shawwwn> ok, project ID is quantum-conduit-310216
[10:33:33] <shawwwn> make that your default project then run `pu create -np` and you'll get a non-preemptible v2-8
[10:33:40] <shawwwn> then you can `pu ssh` into it
[10:35:16] <nshepperd2> pu create doesn't exist lol
[10:35:30] <shawwwn> oh sorry
[10:35:35] <shawwwn> pip install --pre -U tpunicorn
[10:35:41] <shawwwn> it's still prerelease

[10:36:56] <shawwwn> as far as I know, you can't create them in regions you don't get free credits in
[10:37:04] <shawwwn> but pu automatically selects a region based on type
[10:37:19] <shawwwn> v3-8's use euw4a by default, and v2-8's use usc1f by default
[10:37:28] <shawwwn> v2 pods use usc1a, v3 pods use euw4a
[10:37:38] <shawwwn> you can override by passing -z usc1a
[10:37:43] <nshepperd2> seems reasonable
[10:38:06] <shawwwn> there's a lot of pod quota in that project btw
[10:38:11] <shawwwn> feel free to use it
[10:38:19] <shawwwn> no one's doing anything with it since lucas left aleph
[10:41:16] <nshepperd2> sounds useful for trainign difffusion
[10:41:28] <shawwwn> looks like it has a preemptible v3-512 worth of quota in euw4a, and a preemptible v2-256 in usc1a
[10:42:12] <shawwwn> lol
[10:42:18] <shawwwn> I just checked gpt-2-15b-poetry
[10:43:09] <shawwwn> it has 2560 v3-8 pod cores in euw4a, and 2560 preemptible v2-8 pod cores in both euw4a and usc1a
[10:43:29] <shawwwn> and 128 non-preemptible v3-8 pod cores in euw4a
[10:44:04] <shawwwn> that said, euw4a is currently experiencing a capacity crisis, so I doubt you'll be able to create pods there. But you might try making a non-preemptible v3-32 in euw4a to see
[10:44:07] <nshepperd2> that's probably enough lmao
[10:44:30] <shawwwn> we used to be able to train on a v3-1024
[10:44:31] <shawwwn> those were the days
[10:44:36] <nshepperd2> wat, why does gcloud want to make a new ssh key
[10:45:01] <shawwwn> because gcloud is literally aids and hitler combined into a body that looks like stalin
[10:45:12] <shawwwn> stalin aidsler
[10:45:27] <shawwwn> but yes, gcloud automatically manages your ssh keys
[10:46:04] <shawwwn> let me know when you're in so that I can doze off :D
[10:48:01] <shawwwn> btw, you can use `pip3 install jaxtpu` to install the latest JAX + libtpu. It's my hacky pip package that I use because I can never remember the official command
[10:48:35] <nshepperd2> i'm in
[10:48:40] <shawwwn> it installs those packages and then sends a ctrl-c to pip to prevent it from installing `jaxtpu` itself
[10:48:47] <shawwwn> I was rather proud of how awful that hack was..
[10:48:48] <shawwwn> cool
[10:48:56] <nshepperd2> jesus
[10:49:22] <shawwwn> it was the only way to get pip to install other packages :)
[10:49:28] <adiabatic> why not use a bash/zsh/fish alias for that instead of a hacked-up pip file
[10:49:51] <shawwwn> because once you ssh into a new TPU, yo udon't have anything except the standard stuff that comes with the TPU
[10:49:57] <shawwwn> you can install that other stuff, sure
[10:50:06] <shawwwn> but I just wanted a pip command
[10:50:27] <ggreer> https://www.crowdcow.com/ the world is a very big place and it has a lot of stuff in it. apparently "crowd cow" is a legitimate business with around 100 employees

[10:50:33] <shawwwn> anyway all the ports are open, and you'll likely be screwing around with tensorboard versions and such to figure out how to run the profiler
[10:51:01] <shawwwn> ... oh ... I just remembered ... the profiler only works if you *don't* oom
[10:51:03] <saturn2> why not write a script that installs what you need on a new tpu
[10:51:29] <shawwwn> saturn2: I didn't have a convenient url alias
[10:51:47] <shawwwn> (you'd have to remember the url)

[10:52:27] <shawwwn> lel, you'd think. but since gcloud manages ssh keys, it's not quite that straightforward
[10:52:33] <shawwwn> I do want pu to be able to handle that case though
[10:52:54] <shawwwn> nshepperd2:  my process would be, scale down the model size until it runs on a v2-8, then profile mem usage to see where it's going
[10:53:06] <shawwwn> that'll give you info you can use to optimize
[10:53:21] <shawwwn> use @jax.named_call to mark functions for the profiler too
[10:53:30] <shawwwn> the names will show up in the timeline view and in the raw HLO outputs
[10:53:36] <shawwwn> enjoy~
[10:53:40] <nshepperd2> you can add your public key to some config box on the website, that'll let you ssh in directly to any tpu as long as you know its ip
[10:54:12] <shawwwn> yes, but then you'd need to know its ip
[10:54:25] <shawwwn> pu can do that -- it's how I set up my cloudflare-update-tpu script
[10:54:34] <nshepperd2> that's what i did with my v3-8 i was testing diffusion with

[10:56:24] <shawwwn> but screw all that. I want solutions to be effortless for new TPU VM users
[10:56:32] <shawwwn> and pip3 install jaxtpu means no one has to do anything

[18:13:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> The worst-case scenario is that COVID is the cause of the antisingularity
[18:13:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Or, the most important proximate cause, perhaps)
[18:13:49] <feep> covid as an x-risk?
[18:14:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Is it prima facie implausible? I don't see how
[18:14:08] <feep> hang on do you mean antisingularity as in ufai, or permanent curtailment of human flourishing?
[18:14:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean Moldbug's Antisingularity hypothesis, which results in the latter, yes
[18:14:50] <feep> I don't know that thing, but I can guess
[18:15:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, it's not any kind of surprising big-brain idea, it's pretty obvious once explained or even named
[18:15:53] <rsaarelm> Clearly yet another anthropic principle effect keeping people from getting too smart or too clever with computers to keep the timeline-terminating UFAI from coming into existence.
[18:15:57] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: like, even 100 years ago I'd have agreed, but I don't think we're at a point rn where we stand a risk of losing the infrastructure of researching fixes for the next generation
[18:16:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The trends of stagnation, deterioration of social technology, etc., outpace the trends of technological improvement, we don't get AGI, and the world more or less keeps getting worse"
[18:16:14] <feep> ie. imo worst plausible case this destroys one generation for human progress
[18:16:42] <feep> I mean, covid is environmental, the biggest concession it requires is "iq exists"

[18:17:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: My point is that while two years ago I would find your reply plausible, *now* we have this new thing that could seriously tip the scales
[18:17:12] <rsaarelm> People getting too clever with Lisp and designing computer OSes for expert programmers in the 80s, nope! here's Bill and Steve making idiot computers for peons, the AI winter and internet bullshit.
[18:17:39] <alampridius> Covid kills very old people whose minds have deteriorated so it probably raises mean IQ
[18:17:51] <rsaarelm> CPUs getting ubiquitous and damn powerful, oops, some stupid cryptocurrency shit dropped in and now the production pipelines are dry and compute resources are being burned to grind stupid shit.
[18:18:01] <feep> alampridius: problem is volume, not average
[18:18:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> alampridius: That sort of statistical artifact isn't actually what affects progress vs. stagnation etc.

[21:00:12] <feepbot> spider, he speed-climbed it to the top. "This is The Treehouse", he said. "You have to be able to climb to get in. The secret to climbing is that it's not about leg strength, but about solving the puzzle of where to go." I looked up. "If leg strength isn't solving your problem, you just don't have strong enough legs." I grabbed onto the wall and doggedly made my way up, pushing
[21:00:12] <feepbot> hard off any leghold I could find from slanted or protruding bricks. I made it. Dorsey was grinning, and I could see all the tables of a cute little cafe there, and knew that an ice-cold Fresca was waiting for me. <-- I'm not entirely sure what this means, but my tentative interpretation is that "jack dorsey is my spirit animal and the message is to not skip leg day"

[22:42:31] <two2thehead> hmm. I recall seeing that it shows up on replicated tests, I'll double check
[22:43:14] <galambo> for example laptops. jdm laptops tend to have better qc. they also have more keys on the keyboard so you can assign hotkeys to those extra keys.
[22:43:25] <galambo> anyways
[22:44:25] <ggreer> galambo: both times we just drank scotch and bullshitted about politics and philosophy and got super shitfaced. now that I'm out of the bay area, I doubt I'll ever meet him again
[22:45:34] <galambo> ggreer, nice. he seems like a very interesting person to get to know and chat with. I listened to some of his podcast interviews.

[22:46:36] <ggreer> my main gripe is that he prefers to say things that are fun or edgy rather than things that are true. but that's the case for a lot of people. never me. no I'd never do that...
[22:47:00] <gwern> galambo: the problem is the chat tends to be one way

[22:47:26] <Robomot> 5 Eerie Signs You May Be Dating a Psychopath (“Psychopath and sociopath are pop psychology terms for what psychiatry calls an antisocial personality disor)
[22:47:41] <two2thehead> As Robert Hare (1993) writes in Without Conscience: “Many people find it difficult to deal with intense, emotionless, or “predatory” stare of the psychopath. Normal people maintain close eye contact with others for a variety of reasons, but the fixated stare of the psychopath is more of a prelude to self-gratification and the exercise of power than simple interest or empathic caring…Some people respond to the emotionless stare
[22:47:41] <two2thehead>  of the psychopath, with considerable discomfort, almost as if they feel like potential prey in the presence of a predator.”
[22:47:47] <ggreer> https://samharris.org/podcasts/through-the-eyes-of-a-cult/ <-- young sam harris made lots of eye contact and stopped doing it when he realized how intrusive it could be to others. he notes that gurus and cult leaders do it a lot

[22:48:06] <two2thehead> ggreer, yep
[22:48:09] <ggreer> start with the blockquote that says "A person’s eyes convey a powerful illusion of inner life. The illusion is true, but it is an illusion all the same."
[22:48:14] <gwern> I often think of the anecdote about babbage going to dinner with carlyle; at the end, babbage thanked him for his lecture on the virtues of silence...
[22:48:50] <gwern> ggreer: yes, but it's *learned*, which means it's not diagnostic of psychopathic vs narcissism. it just means you've learned to manipulate people

[22:49:09] <ggreer> yeah it's definitely not instinctive
[22:49:29] <galambo> well I mean reading a book is kind of the same. if I read feynman, it feels like I am having a one way conversation with him. but I still enjoy it.
[22:49:37] <ggreer> though people with certain personality traits do find it easier to eye-fuck others
[22:49:55] <ivan> moldbug says bitcoin go to 0 in 2013 because government intervention. your lesson is to invest in human evil and government incompetence
[22:50:10] <galambo> do you guys think holmes was a scammer?
[22:50:11] <gwern> ivan: he was still holding some bitcoin as a hedge, tho
[22:50:30] <galambo> didnt he say something like buy a bitcoin as a fuck you just in case

[22:50:55] <kuudes> galambo, isn't it certain already she was a scammer?
[22:51:23] <ivan> she was returning a lot of incorrect blood tests
[22:51:39] <two2thehead> "Participants with high Factor 1 scores showed reduced emotional modulation of the pupil response to negative images and angry faces but not to any of the positive stimuli."
[22:51:39] <ivan> I think that puts you in the scammer zone

[22:52:01] <galambo> ivan, fair enough
[22:52:16] <ggreer> two2thehead: eh. isn't that also true of people who don't feel fear very strongly? I bet alex honnold would be considered a psychopath by that test
[22:52:34] <gwern> two2thehead: yeah, that's more logical: the insensitivity to fear/punishment is in fact a trait distinguishing narcissist from psychopaths. but seeing pupil dilation variation based on fear would be quite hard
[22:53:29] <galambo> is there a more high tech way of measuring fear? like say fmri?
[22:53:30] <two2thehead> ggreer, gwern dunno. I suppose we could be going into terminology/taxonomy then?
[22:53:53] <galambo> (or cortisol levels :P)
[22:53:53] <kuudes> I am with gwern on the psychopath/narcissistic
[22:54:37] <kuudes> psychopaths are those people who are in prison for drunken assaults on people, narcissists are those people who are in company boards for screwing other people
[22:54:44] <two2thehead> sociopath then?
[22:54:59] <gwern> galambo: 'ms holmes, I'm quite interested in investing in your exciting new startup, but first, a mere matter of routine, could you please step into the fmri chamber'
[22:55:20] <kuudes> gwern, well, now you put it that way, have you asked pg if they would do that?
[22:55:32] <galambo> gwern, well Im pretty sure an fmri session is cheaper than whatever the investors paid into her company
[22:55:38] <two2thehead> although you guys are making a good argument for her just being narcissistic.
[22:55:41] <gwern> kuudes: I regret to report that the topic has never come up
[22:55:48] <kuudes> :D
[22:55:49] <gwern> two2thehead: oh, I already went over all this in my review of _bad blood_
[22:55:55] <two2thehead> ah
[22:56:31] <gwern> galambo: sure. the *stupid* investors. it wasn't YC or google ventures etc who invested in her. even draper initially was investing in something quite different and much more plausible (wifi-enabled bandages or something)
[22:56:47] <gwern> stupid investors, being stupid due to fomo etc, would not use such things even if it were acceptable
[22:57:13] <gwern> (which is why they, say, didn't blink an eye when holmes refused to provide them a machine to try out)
[22:57:29] <galambo> gwern, since we brought this up, is there any way to be an angel investor while outside SV?
[22:57:46] <gwern> sure. you just hand people checks

[23:04:14] <PapuaHardyNet> galambo: how about using smart contracts to invest in other people / companies? (no I haven't thought this through, I'm just throwing out a possibility)
[23:04:33] <galambo> gwern, I didnt know that word meant that. TIL
[23:05:01] <galambo> PapuaHardyNet, I was also thinking of that. there are lots of cryptos nowadays that are basically startups.
[23:05:35] <gwern> galambo: yeah, 'angel investor' sounds all formal and fancy and like you're part of some organized choir bowing to celestial rules, but really, all it means is you handed a guy a $10k or $100k check for a promise of some equity in a company he's starting. that's the one and only thing that makes an angel vc
[23:06:03] <kuudes> the third f of family, friends and fools
[23:06:40] <gwern> it's sort of how like there's many things that can go into 'bring a writer', but there is actually one and only one thing which is both sufficient and necessary: you put a bunch of words into a sequential order.

It is a space where things could go either way. “Hey, hold on, excuse me — I have something really important to ask you,” the blond kid says to the girl. “The moment I saw you, my eyes were just — oh, my God, I love you, please could — bleagh!” The “bleagh” is the sound he makes when the other boy punches him in the face...I think
