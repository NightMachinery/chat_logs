[05:31:54] <flyback> I don't mind some requirements like uefi which has existed for over 10 yrs now
[05:32:02] <flyback> but the tpm is harder not everything has support
[05:32:17] <flyback> although win11 installs on a norma bios just fine
[05:32:25] <flyback> all you do is make 2 usb sticks
[05:32:30] <flyback> one win10 usb stick installer
[05:32:34] <flyback> one win11 usb stick installer

[05:32:50] <flyback> use the win10 usb to do the install
[05:33:28] <flyback> install.esd is like either a disk image or a zip file and the installer just unpacks it

[05:36:28] <flyback> I think it wasn't till early x86-64 bit p4's that are missing some instructions won't work for win11
[05:36:35] <flyback> anything core2duo and up seems to work
[05:37:06] <flyback> obviously minus some features
[05:37:45] <ilikeyou> interesting
[05:38:33] <flyback> make sure when you copy the install.esd from the win11usb you over write the one on the win10 usb
[05:38:56] <flyback> also you will need a supported machine probbaly to get the installer for win11 to make the usb but I could be wrong
[05:39:11] <flyback> if it does turn out to be true, use a linux box to downlod the iso version
[05:39:56] <flyback> glad m$ finally cut off 32 bit support
[05:40:42] <flyback> too many vendors using old kernel mode drivers that cause security issues
[05:40:52] <flyback> the only way to make them stop is to take it away from them

[06:14:25] <flyback> they were trying to use some atom laptop with a 1280x800 display it couldn't even fill the whole overhead screen

[07:14:23] <mats1> and the ocr in ios is garbage for turning my notes into something searchable
[07:15:51] <mats1> relatedly, i have a pile of pdfs and papers i'd like to render searchable with ocr, but 100% of the time it turns into a project where i have to sanitise the output for correctness
[07:17:43] <Joanna> Oh I don’t transform notes into anything. I just use them to help me understand what I’m doing

[07:31:02] <Joanna> The act of reading the notes helps me concentrate I guess
[07:33:18] <mats1> i'm a proponent of banning computers in lecture halls, with audio/video recordings made available afterwards for people that need them
[07:33:49] <mats1> and slide decks or whatever is used for instruction
[07:35:05] <Joanna> Do people even go to lectures anymore with all the hysteria lately?
[07:35:34] <Joanna> I was always horrible at taking notes at lectures I couldn’t write fast enough
[07:36:31] <TheLinuxNerd> my writing is so horrible than in a week if I don't recall what I wrote about I can not read it :-D
[07:36:37] <TheLinuxNerd> no matter how hard I try
[07:36:48] <Joanna> Try printing it helps
[07:37:12] <mats1> online instruction is a real disaster, quite a lot of young people will be academically impaired going into the future
[07:37:35] <Joanna> I can read my writing but it’s often rather sloppy

[07:38:40] <Joanna> mats1: I consider irc to be a form of online instruction and have learned a lot before freenode was destroyed and a lot of people disappeared rather than come to libera
[07:39:14] <flyback> yeah thats my big concern also, I will never see some of my online friends again cause of what was done to freenode
[07:39:18] <flyback> I can't forgive lee for that
[07:39:26] <flyback> anyways night
[07:40:06] <Joanna> Formal instruction has always been garbage in my opinion it’s just teaching people how to take tests
[07:40:55] <Joanna> As well as wrecking confidence and self esteem
[07:42:36] <electr0n> I have learned tons from folks I have met on IRC.
[07:43:06] <Joanna> Yea it’s amazing I really miss it

[07:43:18] <electr0n> doesn't mean Libera cannot continue that for you.
[07:43:26] <ajak> it will take a little bit of time i think
[07:43:57] <Joanna> Well I’m trying to learn new things but so many channels besides this one are really inactive now. They came here but nobody talks.
[07:44:06] <mats1> i still grep my freenode logs, nothing of value was lost
[07:44:59] <ajak> the channels i'm in are fewer in people, i attribute the lesser activity to that
[07:46:15] <Joanna> The channel for a programming language I use was completely destroyed as a result of the freenode breakup . 3 of the most active members refuse to come to libera to this day even though it has become abundantly obvious that libera is the better choice
[07:47:05] <mats1> i'd still be on freenode if irccloud didn't get its users klined
[07:47:38] <Joanna> mats1: you can go there on IRCCloud they finally unbanned it after they scared everyone away
[07:47:46] <ajak> yeah, it's also possible freenode has irreparably harmed the IRC community
[07:47:56] <ajak> i choose to not believe that ;)
[07:50:07] <Joanna> My irc cloud was banned and I went to the channel and told people it’s hard for me to come here can we please move to another network? And they just kept telling me it’s my fault and im being negative.they have no problem with all the abuse the new owner dishes out :) including the latest one of forcing people to make accounts through their website which I’ve heard is picky about email addresses :)

[07:52:42] <Joanna> Psychological hang ups I meant to say.
[07:53:58] <mats1> i don't see the new mgmt as being qualitatively different than the old mgmt
[07:55:45] <ajak> new mgmt of what vs old management of what?
[07:55:57] <ajak> qualitatively the new management of libera is the same as the old management of freenode
[07:56:26] <ajak> it's the whole "if you replace all the parts of a car is it the same car?"
[07:56:45] <ajak> freenode is the car whose pieces all got replaced
[07:56:55] <ajak> libera was made out of the original car
[07:58:41] <mats1> libera mgmt is full of sjws and freenode mgmt is also full of sjws, but also some trump people
[08:01:20] <ajak> i guess we can make guesses about which run the better network then :p
[08:02:23] <mats1> an acquaintance was klined for sharing porn on libera a few weeks back
[08:02:48] <Joanna> Porn I.
[08:02:56] <Joanna> In a public channel ?
[08:03:06] <mats1> probably
[08:03:16] <Joanna> I would Kline too :)
[08:03:30] <jessicara> is that against network rules?
[08:03:33] <ajak> it is
[08:03:44] <ajak> "oh no, the network has rules! :("
[08:03:47] <Joanna> If it isn’t it should be
[08:03:55] <mats1> o noes, tits and vagina on a foss network
[08:04:18] * jessicara has read the rules numerous times and never seems to have them sink in
[08:04:45] <mats1> network admins can do what they want with their toy, of course
[08:04:55] <Joanna> If I wanted a network full of garbage I’d go elsewhere
[08:05:06] <ajak> Joanna: like to freenode? :D
[08:05:10] <mats1> but it is pretty lulzy some small dicks and women get worked up over a few links to tits
[08:05:22] <ajak> jessicara: https://libera.chat/policies
[08:05:27] <jessicara> ajak: i know
[08:05:28] <ajak> "unwanted content" section
[08:05:33] <Joanna> Porn is misogyny
[08:05:37] <jessicara> some is
[08:05:46] <jessicara> ...probably a lot
[08:05:52] <Joanna> It doesn’t belong on a network about foss
[08:06:04] <wilsonfisk> the fact that needs to be explained to some people is disgusting.
[08:06:11] <wilsonfisk> and they should get help.
[08:06:15] <ajak> yeah..
[08:06:18] <wilsonfisk> or get tested for some mental deficiency
[08:06:28] <mats1> lol
[08:06:41] <jessicara> those rules are actually interesting, like what hasn't been broken today
[08:06:53] <Joanna> I have nothing against nude beaches for normal families or anything like that
[08:06:53] <jessicara> (not by me)
[08:07:42] <mats1> is it misogyny if its gay porn? or trans?
[08:07:49] <ajak> it doesn't matter
[08:08:13] <ajak> porn is gross, doesn't belong on irc
[08:08:13] <jessicara> think it's content within the content which decides that
[08:08:16] <ajak> this isn't hard
[08:08:17] <jessicara> agreed ajak
[08:08:27] <Joanna> It still doesn’t belong here or anywhere as far as in concerned
[08:08:44] <mats1> guess we're all in the right network then
[08:08:58] <Joanna> Hope so ;)
