[00:17:08] <InPhase> zzz: On Facebook, it appears to be a massive outage across all the servers they own.  Coincidentally a major whistleblower release about Facebook came out today, revealing that they are conducting internal studies that show they are inflicting great societal harm, but then choosing to continue it because altering the algorithms to reduce this harm would reduce profits.  I'm not sure if the outage is 
[00:17:14] <InPhase> a coincidence or not, but it's possible someone working at Facebook read this and became sufficiently agitated to bring down all of their servers and/or network systems.  It would be an understandable reaction to that released information.

[00:25:12] <macaw> But agreed, it's most probably nothing scary.
[00:26:22] <TJ-> FB fluffed a BGP update to all their routers, that was too restrictive, and lost connectivity. This also affected their out-of-band network which should have been separate, preventing remote fixing. That required bodies on-site in data-centers.

[01:22:56] <oldlaptop> noircode: I simply don't buy that. That they're in "similar businesses" does not imply they can reasonably be seen as "competing" with each other, in pretty much exactly the same way that ("spelling it out") a high-class sit-down restaurant isn't competing with a fast food joint simply because they both sell substances loosely describable as food

[02:40:54] <RedNifre> No, I just thought it would be a good idea to upgrade the old Ubuntu to the next LTS.
[02:41:41] <RedNifre> I guess my frustation is that I have a limited time/effort budget for owning my own data.
[02:42:09] <RedNifre> As in, owning all of it is too much work, so I have to decide which data I want to hand over to cloud services somewhere.

[02:43:02] <RedNifre> Well, kinda. I still recommend reading it, except for the "context" concept, which feels outdated in todays world.
[02:43:25] <RedNifre> (Because "I'm in front of my computer" is kinda the all encompassing context these days)
[02:43:35] <Guest8431> I would not recommend cloud data
[02:44:03] <RedNifre> Sure, but not handing my data to a service requires effort.
[02:44:07] <Guest8431> always remember you have manual methods too: in example, paper and pen
[02:44:12] <Guest8431> or print works
[02:44:19] <yin> RedNifre: yeah it's kind of the same thing but explicit permission to stream your screen is usually required

[04:50:54] <InPhase> Should it be necessary to time travel to a land where Python2 is still worth using, you would use ord(b'foo'[0]).  But it's best to focus your efforts on converting old code to Python3.  Patching up Python2 code is only for extreme time-crunch emergencies, and is just delaying the inevitable.

[05:42:29] <grandrew> PlanckWalk, apologies for cross-posting that to #python. In Python, it would be easy to "prove" or "guess" it's a 'set'

[05:44:09] <grandrew> it does, but if something quacks, and quacking does the job, then it's triplesolid duck
[05:44:47] <PlanckWalk> ... that's a terrible analogy for this case.
[05:44:59] <PlanckWalk> It's more like "if it has legs, it's a duck"
[05:45:12] <grandrew> I mean, by analyzing the code it would be easy to infer if something would yield the non-conflicting non-breaking result given the overall "developers common sense"
[05:45:49] <PlanckWalk> You mean just have a convention that only sets are allowed as implied attributes that are used like that?
[05:46:18] <grandrew> let's say I use ".add()" on some kind of language structure, then I use "in" operator for same structure and nothing else - it's safe to assume it is a set

[14:02:24] <pyzozord> not really, but you always can do some magic trick on the server detect the same ip and just send the cookie to that client

[14:08:51] <pyzozord> don't think it's goal is to just be simple
[14:09:01] <pyzozord> It makes secure authentication simpler
[14:09:15] <Corwinoid> no, it makes authentication secure
[14:09:17] <pyzozord> but the more focus is on "secure" than on "simpler"
[14:09:34] <Soni> secure by simpler, yes
[14:09:44] <Soni> but uh anyway
[14:09:55] <Soni> cross-browser etc would be securer
[14:10:05] <pyzozord> no no, "little bit more secure and whole lot securer" :P

[14:10:15] <Corwinoid> simplicity has nothing to do with it, but regardless, whatever accesses credentials in the same keyring can use the same auth tookens
[14:10:27] <Corwinoid> Browsers get this right by not sharing keys by default
[14:10:37] <Soni> you shove all your passwords into the browser
[14:10:37] <pyzozord> Corwinoid: it does though, imagine if you'd need to implement o auth protocols yourself
[14:10:46] <Soni> why can't it cross-browser oauth
[14:11:42] <Corwinoid> pyzozord: that's not the point though, it's a side effect.  The point is that you can serve auth tokens without sending passwords/credentials to apps
[14:11:43] <pyzozord> it makes difficult stuff, easier. It doesn't make easy stuff easier

[15:40:06] <PlanckWalk> The value you get when you add "the closest double to 0.1" to "the closest double to 0.2" probably isn't "the closest double to 0.3"

[15:40:45] <pyzozord> oh I see so "0.1 + 0.2" is more off than "0.3" from the real 0.3
[15:40:56] <PlanckWalk> Yes, I expect so
[15:41:16] <pyzozord> and it's more off enough that the pretty printer decides "no i gotta tell him"
[15:41:22] <PlanckWalk> Yes
[15:41:41] <merijn> pyzozord: Generally, the float pretty printer prints "the shortest representation that converts to the exact same float value"
[15:42:06] <pyzozord> got it, it makes more sense now
[15:42:08] <merijn> pyzozord: Since float literals are converted to the closest representible float value, there are many different literals with the same binary value
[15:42:17] <merijn> And printing prefers the shortest one
[15:42:40] <pyzozord> yeah makes sense
[15:42:45] <PlanckWalk> The algorithm to do this is not pretty.
[15:42:59] <pyzozord> I imagine some bitwise ops

[16:50:55] <norskalm> bjs what  the hell were python devs thinking when they forgot about passing return value from exec ???
[16:51:21] <bjs> norskalm: what do you mean?  You're not supposed to exec() code from inside a function,  it basically never works
[16:51:46] <bjs> norskalm: you're not even *allowed* to write `exec("return 42", ...)` it will just error (it's a SyntaxError)
[16:52:20] <norskalm> bjs it should work.
[16:52:22] <bjs> norskalm: the fact you're trying to get around it by exec()ing the __code__ doesn't fix it, you will just get really weird behaviour (especially if you also pass *both* locals and globals to exec).  Exec is a weird function.
[16:52:30] <norskalm> foo=exec("return 42)

[16:53:27] <norskalm> it SHOULD.
[16:53:29] <bjs> The code to exec() should be a whole Python program (e.g. valid as a file)
[16:53:31] <norskalm> is my point
[16:53:32] <bjs> norskalm: it shouldn't.  
[16:53:37] <norskalm> why not?
[16:53:48] <norskalm> that's what every sane person expects
[16:54:06] <bjs> norskalm: because that is not what exec is for.  It's not that the devs "forgot" about return. it's explicitly not part of exec. No it's not what sane people expect. You can't "return" outside of a "def" in Python
[16:54:08] <norskalm> IDK
[16:54:09] <norskalm> why
[16:54:22] <norskalm> I understand it IS that way
[16:54:22] <bjs> and exec() takes programs and executes them. Why would it allow a bare return where the rest of the language does?
[16:54:24] <bjs> doesn't*
[16:55:04] <norskalm> whatever
[16:55:08] <norskalm> python sucks xD
[16:55:10] <bjs> norskalm: and it's not just "return" that doesn't work, pretty much any attempt to execute code from the inside of a function won't work. The whole local/non-local/global gets confused if you do that.

[18:09:48] <[itchyjunk]> sounds fancy
[18:10:06] <[itchyjunk]> 1 bit image exploration, what is the point of it?
[18:10:12] <noircode> In programming languages where you can't use ? in a variable name, how do you indicate a query? For example, what if you wanted to name a function occupied? to check a coordinate position, what would you call it?
[18:10:13] <[itchyjunk]> you visit each pixel and you can change stuff?
[18:10:20] <[itchyjunk]> oh i guess you can turn it black and white?
[18:10:21] <fuzzypixelz> A school project ? :^)
[18:10:35] <[itchyjunk]> isOccupied
[18:10:50] <brobrock> noircode ^ this
[18:11:25] <noircode> if (isOccupied) is sort of odd, vs if (occupied)
[18:11:47] <[itchyjunk]> asking a question where the answer is boolean makes good sense.
[18:11:55] <[itchyjunk]> you said function.
[18:11:58] <noircode> ya
[18:12:06] <[itchyjunk]> if it's a variable, occupied is fine.
[18:12:14] <brobrock> yes
[18:12:16] <[itchyjunk]> if it's a function, asking a question makes sense
[18:12:17] <noircode> it is a function, I just didn't bother to write ()
[18:12:35] <[itchyjunk]> if (boolean value)
[18:12:43] <[itchyjunk]> if (ask a question that returns a boolean value)
[18:12:57] <[itchyjunk]> if (isItOccupied()) {}
[18:13:21] <noircode> that looks poor, hmm
[18:13:22] <nostalgia> Depends on language too

[18:55:26] <t3nj1n> Other than the typical, Data Structure and Algo's rec, here is what I think: Concurrency, Abstraction, Recursion vs Iteration, Programming Paradigms, Closure, State? Let me know if you have any recs!

[18:58:48] <InPhase> t3nj1n: Also there are some transient but currently important core tool use skills like git methods and other processes for collaborative development.
[18:59:26] <ChemicalRascal> Getting a good grip on inversion of control would be a good move, then. Dependency injection is something that some frontend frameworks use pretty heavily. But it depends on what you use.
[19:01:32] <noircode> I think concurrency would be at the top, but idk what the job market is like, only what makes sense
[19:01:36] <ChemicalRascal> Ultimately, especially given you're looking at a 1 or 2 year time horizon, I'd suggest working out how to transition out of bootcamps/tutorials and into just making stuff at some point. If you want to do front-end work, getting to the point where you can go from a concept to having a small webapp or whatever implementing that concept would be good.
[19:02:15] <noircode> if it's front end then probably getting comfortable with event driven stuff

[20:22:33] <macaw> GeDaMo: You seem to be knowledgeable on the subject. Why hasn't there been a good, general JIT for translation for processor architectures? Is the domain really that complex, or is there not a good business model to produce one? I'm guessing the latter, because rossetta kind of proved that a general translator is possible (and quite fast too!).
[20:22:37] <oldlaptop> I'm told LuaJIT is the next thing to magic as well.

[20:25:20] <ShiftyLogic> .NETCore (disclaimer: I worked on a sister team, so I'm biased) has very good JIT. ASPNETCore sits on top of it and is holding its own in most web benchmarks even against native languages. v8/NodeJS doesn't stand a chance.
[20:25:36] <ShiftyLogic> Having said that, even .NETCore is pushing for a native compiler.
[20:26:33] <Corwinoid> oldlaptop: it's not, but LuaJIT exists
[20:26:47] <ShiftyLogic> JIT will just always have spots where CPU jitter happens with cache is needing to be wiped and instructions are translated.
[20:26:59] <GeDaMo> I thought I read that LuaJIT development stopped
[20:27:12] <Corwinoid> I dunno, we use ref
[20:27:24] <ShiftyLogic> If the caching mechanism is any good, hot code paths in JIT environments are almost indistinguishable from native code

[20:28:57] <macaw> GeDaMo: Typing it out, I realized that the problem is not as simple to solve as I had thought.
[20:29:07] <GeDaMo> Yeah, it can be complex
[20:30:50] <ShiftyLogic> Especially when you have to account for pipelines and CPU caches and all the other intricate details of modern CPU architectures
[20:30:53] <GeDaMo> You can do things in asm/machine code that you can't in higher level languages so your IR would have to take that into account

[21:31:38] <pyzozord> why does the cpu and/or os care memory segments? With 64 bit cpus, we can address all memory we will need for the next 100 years
[21:32:24] <GeDaMo> x86-64 doesn't use the segments (except for fs and gs)
[21:32:54] <GeDaMo> Memory protection is used to separate processes and for paging
[21:35:01] <deniska> pyzozord: segments are a relic of computers having more RAM than they were able to address using a single register

[21:37:04] <pyzozord> ah so the segments where used in the past to manage small addressable space, but they are now only used to "tag" certain memory areas with this or that flag, like owned by this process or only readable etc
[21:37:10] <oldlaptop> whereas now they have more register than they can address RAM with

[21:44:10] <deniska> notepad.exe is the best software: 1) instant to start even if your PC ran out of RAM, 2) strips formatting off the copied text, 3) F5 inserts current date and time, 4) stops the whole system from shutting down if you have unsaved changes

[23:37:00] <pyzozord> yeah, I'm not a language lawyer and don't want to work with one :P
[23:37:25] <pyzozord> I mean as far as good patern goes - ok, but this is just bad. Who does language lawering on bad examples

[23:38:05] <brobrock> hi
[23:38:11] <user51> i shot myself in the foot today because of a #define
[23:38:34] <pyzozord> Ugh, need to relax. I have to say this upset me somewhat. He asked me to rate myself from 1-10 on javascript skills, and then he asked me this question
[23:38:47] <user51> i incremented a variable that was used in it, so the execution got screwed. took a few mins to understand :D
[23:38:54] <pyzozord> that's rude, no?

[23:39:56] <user51> not my usual defintion of rude - but does apply in some sense e.g what kind of answer would pepole give/
[23:40:30] <wedr> I personally don't even know what .bind() does.
[23:40:36] <user51> if you said 10 maybe he'd ask you something appropriate for a mega city judge
[23:40:44] <pyzozord> I said 8
[23:41:25] <wedr> Hot take - You could say you lost 2 points because you are mostly right 80% of the time.
[23:41:32] <Pajus> vote for trump 
[23:41:59] <pyzozord> yeah and I'm quite sure I'd got offer from them, but I don't want to work with that guy
[23:42:26] <pyzozord> for me that's a red flag, I'd be arguing with that guy instead of focusing on work
[23:43:01] <tane> wedr, I took a quick look, B.bind(null, x) implies a function (y) => B(x, y) with "this = null"

[23:43:13] <pyzozord> I'm not really sure at what time are default arguments evaluated
[23:43:25] <pyzozord> because noone ever writes freaking default functions as functions
[23:43:25] *** Joins: Crescendo (~Crescendo@user/crescendo)
[23:43:29] <wedr> at runtime?
[23:43:37] <tane> lol
[23:43:47] <tane> declaration time or call time, the latter is right
[23:43:54] <pyzozord> actually I knew what .bind does
[23:43:57] <tane> but both are "runtime"
[23:44:24] <wedr> pyzozord, technically, default arguments are very useful when in situations where you need to make a feature backwards-compatible, but also still improve upon it via overloading functions.
[23:44:42] <pyzozord> I just didn't know when will be the default arguments evaluated, only once, or each time. At the time of declaration, execution
[23:45:10] *** Quits: cq-work (~Z_Lund@216-177-186-25.block0.gvtc.com) (Quit: WeeChat 3.3)
[23:45:18] <pyzozord> wedr: default argument but not (a=foo()) => {}
[23:45:28] <tane> so `.bind` sets the context and allows for partial application?
[23:45:33] <tane> actually a pretty cool function
[23:45:47] <wedr> pyzozord, That's code golf for you.
[23:45:55] <pyzozord> .bind changes the 'this' of a function and gives some arguments
[23:46:14] <wedr> Actually, I think jQuery uses .bind() often
[23:46:31] <pyzozord> js uses .bind quite often in general because of the nature of prototypal object model
[23:46:46] <tane> ((a,b,c,d) => a + b + c +d).bind(null, 1, 2)(3, 4) === 10
[23:47:09] <pyzozord> but noone writes function(a=foo()) that is just an awful thing to do
[23:47:19] <pyzozord> and if I needed to do it, I'd just test it
[23:47:52] <pyzozord> probing if I have this specific thing in my head is not really doing anything as an interview question
[23:48:03] <pyzozord> it's just designed to bring you down
[23:49:15] <wedr> As all interview questions should be...
[23:49:47] <wedr> In practice, no one does it like that. But from a specs standardization standpoint, this is supported, and is thus within the scope of the interview questions.
[23:50:51] <tane> xD
[23:52:47] <pyzozord> well at least I learned another thing I didn't know about javascript
[23:52:57] <beaky> nice i like javascript
