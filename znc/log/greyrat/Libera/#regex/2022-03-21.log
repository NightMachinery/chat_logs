[00:52:19] <zamba> i have the following regex that should match for magnetic stripe tracks: ^%.*\?;.*\?+.*\?$
[00:52:33] <zamba> the problem with it is that i want the three different fields to be optional
[00:53:03] <zamba> i attempted to do ^(%.*\?)?(;.*\?)?(+.*\?)?$
[00:53:08] <zamba> but that didn't work at all :)
[00:53:39] <zamba> the specification for the different tracks says that the first track starts with % and ends with ?, the second starts with ; and ends with ? and the last one starts with + and ends with ?

[11:17:22] <digitok> very nice
[11:17:31] <re101-drever-80> I need an expression that captures "X:/aktuell/SWFL/18-028_K13/330_Rohrleitungen" and "msg"

[11:17:51] <digitok> :'(
[11:17:55] <re101-drever-80> It needs to be done with a capture group
[11:18:30] <digitok> so up until the 5th / ?
[11:18:35] <digitok> and then the extension?
[11:18:56] <re101-drever-80> nope i need to match
[11:18:59] <re101-drever-80> the entire thing
[11:19:03] <re101-drever-80> not the slashes
[11:19:10] <digitok> i mean for the captures
[11:19:29] <digitok> does the first one always end at the 5th /
[11:19:59] <re101-drever-80> nope
[11:20:13] <digitok> ok, so how do we determine where to stop
[11:20:18] <re101-drever-80> they want to capture whatever is written on the capture group
[11:20:32] <digitok> o.O

[11:22:27] <re101-drever-80> it should just match whatever is entered on the group

[20:34:33] <OnlineCop> regex123: Why not just match `\d+` and remove the '/g' (global) flag?

[20:34:43] <VectorX> if you do /\d+/  it will be in the match, if not https://regex101.com/r/7xWo3x/2
[20:35:09] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/7xWo3x/3 as well.
[20:35:43] <re101-dog-24> my data uses both linefeeds and carriage returns as a newline, but not together. But they don't match on the site. How do I get these to work on the site?
[20:36:10] <re101-dog-24> otherwise I have to convert them, then convert them back, it causes a lot of problems
[20:36:25] <OnlineCop> I usually use `\r?\n`
[20:36:25] <purplex> my suggestion would be \d+ without /g 
[20:37:14] <re101-dog-24> I mean that I tried pasting my data into the "test string" area on the site, then I tried matching \r but I get 0 matches
[20:37:21] <re101-dog-24> even though there shoudl be like 12
[20:37:57] <OnlineCop> Linux is typically LF only (\n) and Windows is typically CRLF (\r\n). Are you trying to single out either-or?
[20:38:37] <purplex> regex101 won't match your \r @ dog
[20:38:42] <OnlineCop> I've noticed the same behavior; it tends to be that the browser removes those characters when you print.
[20:38:45] <re101-dog-24> Not really, I'm just trying to get it to work on the site

[20:40:03] <re101-dog-24> kinda makes it hard to build/test my expression when it can't use my data lol
[20:40:05] <OnlineCop> re101-dog-24: Does your data contain \r without \n?
[20:40:24] <OnlineCop> (?:\r?\n|\r)
[20:40:30] <purplex> try notepad++ maybe to see the results
[20:40:42] <purplex> it handles both linux and windows linefeeds
[20:40:44] <OnlineCop> ^ "Match CRLF (or just LF); if that fails, match only CR"
[20:41:15] <purplex> you can probably convert between them without regex (it has a lot of features)
[20:41:18] <re101-dog-24> it uses both, but separately, and specifically. Sometimes it uses CR, some lines LF. I think I can use those to make my regex more strict, as it seems to be the same every time
[20:42:02] <re101-liger-29> https://regex101.com/r/thI8WW/1 --> Unable to create regEx which will give me all occurrences of 'Started by <string>'
[20:42:39] <re101-dog-24> I'll use notepad++, that's what I view the files with anyway lol just wish I could visualize it because I like regex101
[20:43:27] <OnlineCop> re101-liger-29: That regex requires that the line above it have "originally caused by" but line 3 doesn't have that. You could change `[a-zA-Z]+` to `[a-zA-Z].*` maybe?
[20:43:34] <purplex> turn on "show all characters" to visualize \r and \n
[20:44:02] <OnlineCop> re101-dog-24: What happens when you use (?:\r?\n|\r) in place of \r\n ?
[20:45:03] <purplex> (?:\r?\n|\r) means r\n, \n or \r @ dog 
[20:45:07] <OnlineCop> re101-liger-29: Is https://regex101.com/r/thI8WW/3 what you're after?
[20:46:16] <re101-liger-29> OnlineCop Awesome! Thanks a lot
[20:46:58] <re101-dog-24> purplex do you mean in notepad++ or can I do that in regex101? liger-29 just posted a question and \n worked for him and was matching
[20:47:20] <purplex> in notepad++
[20:47:46] <purplex> regex101 doesn't have concept of \r yet
[20:48:23] <OnlineCop> I think _website forms_ don't have a concept of \r yet.
[20:49:17] <OnlineCop> re101-dog-24: When you paste your text into TEST STRING and search for _just_ `\r`, does it show any matches? Same question for only `\n` and `\r\n`.
[20:50:00] <re101-dog-24> so \n does work but \r gives 0 matches yeah
[20:50:10] <purplex> he said it before yeah "I tried pasting my data into the "test string" area on the site, then I tried matching \r but I get 0 matches"
[20:50:17] <re101-dog-24> I guess all \r are replaced to \n when you paste
[20:53:05] <OnlineCop> ^ That's common with most browsers I've ever encountered.

[20:53:53] <re101-dog-24> re101-liger-29 why not: https://regex101.com/r/thI8WW/1 also you need to add a space to your character group because it looks like there's spaces in it
[20:54:56] <purplex> re101-dog-24: what about (?:\r?\n|\r) ?
[20:54:56] <OnlineCop> re101-dog-24: Is your pattern (not the test string) using \r, \n, or \r\n?
[20:55:43] <re101-dog-24> some lines are \n some are \r, but seemingly always the same lines
[20:56:30] *** Quits: ravan_ (~ravan@user/ravan) (Remote host closed the connection)
[20:56:40] <purplex> is your goal to make the regex work, or convert your file to all \n or \r\n or \r ?
[20:57:09] *** Joins: ravan_ (~ravan@user/ravan)
[20:57:22] <OnlineCop> One of our devs had the same problem, and used `(*ANYCRLF)` at the beginning of the pattern. Then, matches looking for `\n` would behind-the-scenes also match `\r` and `\r\n` properly. Not sure if any of the `(*`... verbs on regex101 might be useful?
[20:57:38] <re101-dog-24> I just wanted it to work on the site, I think I can manage the regex on my own
[20:57:59] <re101-dog-24> looks like I can just use \n for all newlines and then replace specific ones with \r when I'm ready to test it in my code
[20:58:01] *** Quits: ravan_ (~ravan@user/ravan) (Remote host closed the connection)
[21:01:54] <purplex> usually the file should be consistent with either using all \n or all \r or \r\n
[21:02:28] <purplex> how did the file become mixed with both? just curious
[21:02:51] <re101-dog-24> low quality code, most likely
[21:02:55] <OnlineCop> I've got some files that are CRLF, but they have \r for newlines within special circumstances.
[21:03:23] <OnlineCop> Mainly Unity files that have some odd serialization requirements. :eyeroll:
[21:03:45] <re101-dog-24> or done deliberately
[21:04:13] <re101-dog-24> I'm not sure how to explain it, but looking at the data, I can see this being deliberate
[21:04:41] <OnlineCop> Is the code in a repo? Perhaps you can `git blame`/`svn blame` to see who wrote it?
[21:05:13] <OnlineCop> It could have been an editor misconfiguration that they didn't realize was off till later, but forgot to re-edit those previous lines.
[21:05:29] <re101-dog-24> nah I don't have access to it, I am a 3rd party parsing log files from an MRI

[21:12:35] <OnlineCop> I think the only situation where I wouldn't want to use the `(?:\r?\n|\r)` construct is when I'm trying to optimize by searching for `[^\r\n]*`. I've found that several engines (like .NET) allow the `.` (dot) meta character to match `\r` and only stop at `\n`, as though `.` was an alias for `[^\n]` instead of `[^\r\n]`.

[21:17:30] <re101-dog-24> as a c# programmer, I'm pretty sure .net specifically says it matches everything except \n
[21:18:14] <OnlineCop> Yeah. And that's bitten me a few times. I've had to change all my `.*` to `[^\r\n]*` and my `$` to `(?=\r?\n)`
