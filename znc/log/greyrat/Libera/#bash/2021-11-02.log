[00:01:43] <jaggz> FreeBDSM, keep in mind, process buffers are limited in size
[00:01:56] <jaggz> see stdbuf command
[00:02:02] <FreeBDSM> jaggz: by parsing ps output or something, since `a|b|c|d` starts them all at once - then in case of `a|b|c|ifdun|d` ifdun should be able to see the user's initial chain of commands (I guess)
[00:02:36] <FreeBDSM> err, `a|b|c|ifdun d`
[00:02:54] <jaggz> ifdun needs to just read stdin, catch SIGHUP too, .. and.. uhm..
[00:03:27] <Celmor[m]> phy1729: thanks, fflush() did the trick
[00:03:35] <jaggz> again, just write it up, and use temp files, and catch sigint for cleanup and stuff
[00:03:42] <jaggz> (or is there a bash atexit too)
[00:04:05] <FreeBDSM> no, only trap tapestry
[00:04:08] <jaggz> and later, if you improve it, you can fix it up, but the command will still just work, according to any callers, without them having to know the internal methods
[00:04:25] <jaggz> get stuff done

[11:20:52] <emanuele6> kurahaupo_: i knew that was the case for unset TZ, and, in POSIX pages, i found that functions should have a system specific behaviour when TZ is absent from the environment
[11:21:31] <emanuele6> the behaviour for TZ='' or other invalid values TZ doesn't seem defined

[12:41:45] <greybot> nohup is a hacky wrapper that will execute a process while redirecting its output and preventing SIGHUP from reaching it (some implementations ignore additional signals).

[14:51:44] <earnestly> Although
[14:51:48] <earnestly> This is a TOCTOU
[14:52:05] <earnestly> Doesn't losetup do this "use first available" for you?
[14:52:22] <rendar> earnestly, look better, i call `losetup -f` to get the name of a free loop device, e.g. /dev/loop0, then i call *again* losetup, to use that loop device to create the loop device itself
[14:52:38] <earnestly> That's not a race condition, but it is a TOCTOU
[14:52:54] <rendar> can you expand that acronym?

[14:54:16] *** Joins: fatal (~0x00@user/fatal)
[14:54:38] <earnestly> I don't see what the problem is.  Something like this is not fixable unless losetup lets you provide an image file first, where it returns the loop device it used (rather than the other way around)
[14:54:56] <earnestly> And for such a small window it's often not a problem.  If you do end up racing against something else, you just try again
[14:55:05] <ormaaj> does losetup print the path by default?
[14:55:22] <earnestly> > -f, --find [file]
[14:55:23] <earnestly>            Find the first unused loop device. If a file argument is present, use the found device as loop device. Otherwise, just print its name.
[14:55:28] <earnestly> That second sentence looks good
[14:55:50] <earnestly> > The loop device setup is not an atomic operation when used with --find, and losetup does not protect this operation by any lock.
[14:55:54] <earnestly> You just have to deal with it

[14:56:13] <ormaaj>  For some reason
[14:56:21] <earnestly> Yeah you can determine the mapping afterwards
[14:56:34] <ormaaj> Maybe i'm thinking zramctl
[14:58:10] <earnestly> Also it suggests using -L with -f
[14:58:21] <earnestly> And > It is recommended to use for example flock1 to avoid a collision in heavily parallel use cases
[14:58:31] <earnestly> That flock1 might be a misrender as flock(1)

[15:00:06] <earnestly> rendar: You don't, your current design does, but you can change the way it works by checking afterwards
[15:00:36] <earnestly>        --show

[15:35:37] <emanuele6> you should use -P when parsing the output of df
[15:37:03] *** Quits: shad (~shad@user/shad) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[15:39:34] <emanuele6> -P is a POSIX option for df(1) that forces a predictable output
[15:40:11] <emanuele6> in GNU df the only difference is that the title of the fifth column will be `Capacity' instead of `Use%'
[15:40:34] <rendar> i see
[15:40:37] <emanuele6> but in any case the output format of `df' is not guaranteed unless of -P is specified
[15:42:03] <geirha>  that's not the only difference. You also get each entry on a separate line
[15:42:56] <emanuele6> oh, also it says 1024-blocks instead of 1K-blocks
[15:43:02] <emanuele6> geirha: what do you mean?

[16:04:08] <emanuele6> .bash_aliases is not a standard bash file
[16:04:41] <emanuele6> but it is probably just a file that gets sourced by .bashrc, so, yes, you can use `if'
[16:04:43] <xx> true, it is sourced from my .bashrc so I imagine I should be able to use conditionals

[16:06:15] <xx> I really only use very simple aliases like that, I know functions are for more complex stuff
[16:06:19] <earnestly> But if you're starting to use conditionals you've probably evolved past such simple cases

[16:10:12] <xx> thanks
[16:10:15] <earnestly> emanuele6: E.g. testing if the script is running as root is a proxy condition for some random set of commands that need root, but actually it's because they need read access to some file

[17:07:31] <pawky> well... because of my problems with the command not interpreting */
[17:07:53] <pawky> so i tried to make it exactly as on the command line ' and all

[17:08:16] <emanuele6> !cargocult
[17:08:16] <greybot> Cargo cult programming is copying pieces of code from other programs, without actually knowing what the code does. Subsequent debugging involves rearranging commands to minimize the number of error messages.
[17:08:40] <pawky> well... but that's not the case here...
[17:08:59] <pawky> i did of course start of without all of these things... but as mentioned... it gets wrongly interpreted...
[17:09:15] <Soliton> so what goes wrong?
[17:10:08] <pawky> it seems rsync gets the first parameter --include '*/' as only --include '*' hence including everything
[17:10:23] <Soliton> what makes it seem so?
[17:10:57] <itu> Soliton:       x={1..3} ; for i in $( eval $x ) ; do echo $i ; done    does not work , for example  ... so how to do it?
[17:10:58] <Soliton> if you call rsync like: rsync --include '*/'  then it's simply not so.
[17:11:18] <pawky> exactly, doing the same on the command line directly will give the correct results
[17:11:30] <emanuele6> itu: that would run a command named `1' passing it arguments 2 and 3
[17:11:39] <emanuele6> why are you doing this?
[17:11:40] <itu> i see
[17:11:46] <pawky> doing the --include '*/ --include '*.pdf' --exclude '*' will only give pdf files
[17:11:54] <emanuele6> pawky: you are missing a quote.
[17:11:57] <pawky> but taking the same line into a bash script, it gives all
[17:12:17] <emanuele6> itu: what are you trying to do?
[17:12:24] <Soliton> putting bash code in a script does not change the syntax.
[17:12:38] <Soliton> if it works differently then you're not showing everything.
[17:12:45] <itu> obviously  i want to  set a general expression  for running a loop  ..
[17:12:54] <pawky> Solitoin, well normally not, unless you will have to do some escaping
[17:12:58] *** Joins: n4dir (~user@88.130.152.165)
[17:13:01] <Soliton> non-sense
[17:13:11] <emanuele6> itu: doesn't seem obvious to me, actually i don't understand it at all
[17:13:13] <Soliton> you have to do the same escaping interactively then.
[17:13:27] <pawky>     as such:   "   hello \"world\” "
[17:13:55] <pawky> nothing new there I would say... but anyay, the rsync seems to get  '*' instead of '*/'
[17:14:14] <emanuele6> not really
[17:14:31] <emanuele6> from what you sent earlier, it seemed to get ''\''*/'\''', a.k.a. "'*/'"
[17:14:41] <emanuele6> with the literal single quotes
[17:14:46] <emanuele6> that it should not receive
[17:14:50] <pawky> well... yes.. normally. But I have been debugging this for a while, thats why i ended up copying a string with some extra escapes
[17:14:56] <Soliton> so the code is not as shown.
[17:15:03] <Soliton> show actual code you run.
[17:16:06] <pawky> ok...  so, i will do another run...  can we agree upon me doing this?:    rsync /source /dest --include '*/' --include '*.pdf' --exclude '*'

[17:24:18] <Soliton> !faq complex
[17:24:18] <greybot> https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/050 -- I'm trying to put a command in a variable, but the complex cases always fail!
[17:24:40] <emanuele6> because it is not correct.
[17:24:40] <Soliton> use an array instead of putting multiple args in a single string.
[17:25:14] <Soliton> they way you wrote it you'd need eval and proper quoting since you put shell syntax in there.
[17:25:17] <pawky> ok, will look into arrays...
[17:25:19] <Soliton> the*
[17:25:29] <emanuele6> $args is not evaled, if you have literal double quotes in $args, you will pass literal double quotes to the program even if args is not quoted
[17:25:31] <emanuele6> !quote
[17:25:31] <greybot> https://mywiki.wooledge.org/Quotes
[17:26:00] <emanuele6> also !read-r
[17:26:11] <emanuele6> and on top of that that while loop is useless
[17:26:31] <emanuele6> you can simply use a for loop
[17:26:55] <pawky> in what way, it all needs to end up as a string for the rsync command
[17:27:11] <Soliton> not at all.
[17:27:26] <Soliton> a program with arguments is a list of strings not a string.
[17:28:01] <Soliton> shell code it's a string sure. so if you want to interprete shell code you need eval.

[20:11:37] <greybot> "set -e" is an inheritance of the old bourne shell, and doesn't really work well with modern shell features. You'll really have less buggy scripts if you do the error handling manually instead of relying on the unreliable "set -e"; see http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/105

[22:52:58] <Enissay> I recall I faced a similar issue before when I needed also an OR branch which was giving unexpected results when simply added to the end
[22:53:34] <sixwheeledbeast> !&&
[22:53:34] <greybot> Short-circuit control operators <http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashSheet#Tests> A || B means "Run A. If A fails, run B." A && B means "Run A. If A succeeds, run B." Example: foobar || { echo "error" >&2; exit 1; }
[22:54:39] <Enissay> Aha, found it... I was using && still instead of semi-colon.... https://stackoverflow.com/a/11039851/1519058
[22:54:56] <Enissay> I shouldnt be pushing when tired :x
[22:55:13] <Soliton> just write an if.
[22:56:16] <Soliton> and perhaps leave the ret_code variable out alltogether.

[23:11:51] <docmax> i need a glob
[23:12:07] <llua> ?
[23:12:12] <knstn> !`
[23:12:12] <greybot> The backquote (`) is used in the old-style command substitution, e.g. foo=`command`. The foo=$(command) syntax is recommended instead. Backslash handling inside $() is less surprising, and $() is easier to nest. See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/082
[23:12:22] <docmax> sys/bus/usb/devices/2-2.4.1/uevent
[23:12:35] <docmax> but NOT /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-2.4.1:1.0/uevent
[23:13:05] <Soliton> where is the glob part?
[23:13:13] <docmax> the rule is, NOT the one with :1.0
[23:13:25] <Soliton> so don't put :1.0 there?
[23:13:28] <docmax> or anything that has :x.x
[23:13:37] <Soliton> !extglob
[23:13:37] <greybot> "Extended globs" (shopt -s extglob) allow you to say things like "all files that do not end in .jpg". See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/glob#extglob
