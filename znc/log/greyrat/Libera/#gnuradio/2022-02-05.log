[01:29:44] <RyanVolz[m]> tengamorref: Some other programs rely on the PothosSDR installation to provide support for various things (e.g. SDR++ does this if I'm not mistaken), so it depends on what did that and whether you still need that program. If you don't care about anything else or are fine with breaking other things, then you can purge PothosSDR and hopefully get the radioconda installation fully working. Selfishly, I'd like to understand better how the
[01:29:44] <RyanVolz[m]> interference is happening so we can avoid it in the future and not have to tell people that they can't also install PothosSDR.
[01:31:06] <RyanVolz[m]> I guess I'm going to try installing it myself to see if anything breaks.

[02:26:01] <tcarls[m]> <patchvonbraun[m]> "My gut tells me that NixOS style..." <- We'd need to spend some time coming to a shared set of definitions for what constitutes in-scope "breakage", but (at risk of drifting off-topic) I do not at all agree with that assessment; the NixOS approach constrains the system in such a way as to make large classes of problems impossible (at the expense of telling users "you can't do that" for classes of operations they might
[02:26:01] <tcarls[m]> habitually be accustomed to being able to do). It's very much like functional vs imperative programming; takes different skills and ways of thinking, creates performance overhead that requires design consideration to mitigate, but is very effective at achieving its goals.

[02:37:35] <patchvonbraun[m]> Of course, part of what NiX does was already in-place prior to the emergence of dynamically-linked, shareable libraries.  A binary appilcation would come with itself already linked with all the libraries it depends on, with "conflict" possible only in things like external config files, and the kernel API.  This approach was wasteful of disk space (which is basically a non-issue these days), but also of main memory, since an
[02:37:36] <patchvonbraun[m]> independent instance of a library cannot be shared in physical memory, which was one of the glorious features of shared libraries.  I'll note that main memory isn't nearly as cheap as disk space, and has architecture-linked growth limits.  So, devolving to what amounts to statically-linked executables might not be so wonderful...  But I haven't read the whole thesis, so I shall refrain from further commentary.  
[02:40:09] <tcarls[m]> patchvonbraun[m]: Look at the use of rpaths -- everything built against a given version of glibc (f/e) has a link to `/nix/store/<hash>-glibc-<version>/lib/libc.so.6`; so you still get in-memory duplication when shared libraries are in common, _but_ you can simultaneously have software in the store linked against different libcs, and be sure each piece of software will always run against the libraries it was built/linked/tested with.

[22:24:04] <RyanVolz[m]> <tengamorref> "Is the Pothos version of GRC..." <- It's less self-contained (as you're seeing) and maybe an older version of GNU Radio, but I wouldn't say inferior. There's currently more bundled in the PothosSDR distribution than radioconda, so that's the best argument for using it.
[22:27:11] <RyanVolz[m]> tengamorref: Sounds like that attempt to unset the environment variables didn't take. What does `gnuradio-config-info --print-all` say? How about `echo %GR_PREFIX%` and `echo %GRC_BLOCKS_PATH%`?

[22:30:18] <RyanVolz[m]> Maybe `conda env config vars set GR_PREFIX= GRC_BLOCKS_PATH=`, followed by reloading the Conda Prompt, does the trick?
