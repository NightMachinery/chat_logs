[07:50:32] <iamak[m]> <vipul[m]> "Because Richard the stallman..." <- Lol thanks
[07:51:03] <Arya[m]> <iamak[m]> "I don't want to get ideological,..." <- thats how one distro was called
[07:51:30] <Arya[m]> <AnkanRoy[m]> "people when i turn of sequrity..." <- do you have acer
[07:51:34] <Arya[m]> in acer if you have grub
[07:51:40] <Arya[m]> you cant go to the bios
[07:51:46] <Arya[m]> in my xperience

[07:52:08] *** gtlsgamr_ is now known as gtlsgamr
[07:52:15] <Arya[m]> to see wikipedia in terminal
[07:52:33] <labrador> iamak[m], why cant I read your messages?
[07:52:44] <labrador> First time I saw that mentioned
[07:56:37] <iamak[m]> <Arya[m]> "thats how one distro was called" <- Which one?
[07:56:46] <Arya[m]> its a really old one
[07:56:51] <Arya[m]> i forgot its name
[07:57:00] <iamak[m]> labrador: Idk. Are you on a bridge or sth?
[07:57:13] <Arya[m]> Yggdrasil Linux/GNU/X,
[07:57:15] <Arya[m]> goti t
[07:57:28] <iamak[m]> Arya[m]: Achha nvm then. Chances of me knowing it are next to 0
[07:57:51] <labrador> iamak[m], yes irc bridge
[07:58:02] <labrador> Maybe you said it earlier than I joined
[07:58:08] <labrador> irc has no history
[07:59:57] <iamak[m]> You don't use a bouncer?
[08:00:42] <labrador> na
[08:02:23] <iamak[m]> Gg.. No message history and don't want to set up a bouncer is one if the reasons I don't use IRC
[08:03:08] <Arya[m]> bouncer is simple
[08:03:09] <labrador> I dunno I don't really care about message history.
[08:03:47] <labrador> Because its not like I can communicate my opinions about the things you were discussing
[08:03:52] <labrador> So why to read it
[08:04:43] <iamak[m]> Say you asked a question and went offline. You miss all the replies to it
[08:05:00] <iamak[m]> Arya[m]: Yes I am just lazy😂
[08:05:05] <labrador> I don't go offline when I ask a question
[08:05:16] <Arya[m]> what if
[08:05:17] <Arya[m]> you reboot
[08:05:18] <labrador> And I can just let my client idle if I am away
[08:05:28] <labrador> Arya[m], I won't reboot lmao
[08:05:34] <labrador> I reboot every few days
[08:05:45] <iamak[m]> Computer?
[08:05:50] <labrador> Na lappy
[08:06:00] <iamak[m]> Same difference
[08:06:27] <iamak[m]> Meanwhile I need to reboot almost daily coz games on windows😵
[08:06:41] <Arya[m]> dont play games
[08:06:42] <Arya[m]> :)
[08:07:28] <iamak[m]> 🤥
[08:07:36] <labrador> iamak[m], I don't play games too
[08:07:53] <labrador> First they are proprietary and take away my freedom
[08:07:53] <Arya[m]> same
[08:08:01] <labrador> Second they also spy on me
[08:08:03] <labrador> No thanls
[08:08:03] <Arya[m]> labrador: yas
[08:08:05] <iamak[m]> What do you do with friends?
[08:08:08] <Arya[m]> play redecipse
[08:08:08] <Arya[m]> xonotic

[08:08:20] <labrador> iamak[m], I don't have any friend
[08:08:24] <labrador> :(
[08:08:37] <Arya[m]> i do but i discuss irl stuff only
[08:08:40] <Arya[m]> and that too rarely
[08:08:48] <Arya[m]> because they opnly have whatsapp
[08:08:59] <iamak[m]> I know the risk. Games are installed in my windows partition jisme baki kuch nahi so I see it as a lesser risk
[08:09:29] <iamak[m]> All my main stuff is on Linux
[08:09:49] <Arya[m]> encrypt linux and windows too
[08:09:51] <Arya[m]> dont forget that
[08:09:54] <Arya[m]> veracrpyt for win
[08:10:49] <iamak[m]> Arya[m]: Looks nice
[08:12:00] <labrador> Arya[m], LUKS
[08:12:08] <Arya[m]> yeah
[08:12:14] <Arya[m]> weall know it :)
[08:12:16] <labrador> But veracrypt does have deniable encryption
[08:12:19] <labrador> LUKS does not
[09:51:41] <Tor[m]> <Arya[m]> "because they opnly have whatsapp" <- Signal download karne ko bol
[09:52:06] <Tor[m]> Made 15 people download it
[09:52:12] <Arya[m]> i am going to setup whatsapp bridge today (hopefully) anyways
[09:52:15] <Arya[m]> so doesnt matter
[09:52:21] <Arya[m]> and most of them have signal
[09:52:23] <Arya[m]> but never use it
[09:52:41] <Arya[m]> they have telegram but rarely touch it
[09:52:41] <Tor[m]> Arya[m]: Meme group ya aisa kuch bana
[09:52:41] <vipul[m]> Arya[m]: ek blog bhi bana dena
[09:52:50] <Tor[m]> > <@telegram_646588922:t2bot.io> > <@gi-yt:matrix.org> i am going to setup whatsapp bridge today (hopefully) anyways

[10:04:46] <Tor[m]> Lost contacts to many people
[10:05:19] <Tor[m]> But in the process i called many people
[10:07:51] <labrador> Tor[m], please don't
[10:08:03] <labrador> There is no need of whatsapp plebs here
[10:08:13] <labrador> Telegram is already a compromise

[10:40:12] <labrador> it definitely is
[10:40:14] <Tor[m]> gtlsgamr: Very bad people use deezcord 
[10:40:34] * NeoVoid[m] uploaded an image: (86KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/t2bot.io/37103deb73d7a2a2ee9201a4ac62d57bbc76df23/image.jpeg >
[10:40:57] <NeoVoid[m]> these are network - channel system
[10:41:11] <labrador> That is how discord and irc both work
[10:41:20] <gtlsgamr> Tor[m]: ok got it
[10:41:20] <NeoVoid[m]> not server channel system which use in discord
[10:41:21] <labrador> Even tho discord servers are not real
[10:41:34] <labrador> NeoVoid[m], Discord took inspiration from irc
[10:41:38] <labrador> Not vice versa
[10:41:42] <Tor[m]> NeoVoid[m]: Freenode bhai why 
[10:42:17] <NeoVoid[m]> what i am trying to say is its like matrix servers and channels inside them layout 
[10:42:17] <NeoVoid[m]> not a full channel with sub channel inside them
[10:42:41] <NeoVoid[m]> Tor[m]: its random ss from net
[10:42:51] <NeoVoid[m]> ok how mumble works
[10:42:57] <NeoVoid[m]> * mumble works?
[10:43:04] <smud[m]> Neo Void: Matrix also has spaces which behave in similarily
[10:43:26] <Arya[m]> NeoVoid[m]: its just a simpel voip app
[10:44:03] <labrador> Arya[m], who owns gnulinuxindia.com?
[10:45:32] <gtlsgamr> hey guys.. we have started gnulinuxindia.org since a while but are seeing literally no contribution. IT is hard to actually run this kind of thing without user contribution. IF the site sees some action, only then we might be able to keep it alive... otherwise something else needs to be done. 
[10:45:35] <Tor[m]> .org apna hai na ?
[10:45:37] <gtlsgamr> Maybe a mailing list as an alternative
[10:45:51] <Arya[m]> pystardust: owns the server and domain
[10:45:54] <Arya[m]> but after we setup donations
[10:46:06] <Arya[m]> it will be hopefully community own3ed
[10:46:18] <Arya[m]> with a few admins taking care of server maintanence
[10:46:18] <gtlsgamr> Donations are not the only necessity
[10:46:29] <Arya[m]> posts are too
[10:46:41] <gtlsgamr> involvement is a necessity
[10:46:47] <Arya[m]> gtlsgamr: mailman
[10:46:51] <aryak> gnu mailman
[10:46:57] <aryak> seems simple to setup
[10:47:19] <pystardust> We need ppl with server experience
[10:47:23] <labrador> Do we really eed a mailing list?
[10:47:41] <pystardust> Let us know if you have experience in handling servers
[10:48:15] <pystardust> labrador: i dont think so
[10:48:25] <labrador> I think it will be hard to get a person with server experience
[10:48:38] <labrador> Unless you contact fsf india or something
[10:50:00] <NeoVoid[m]> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn8bCd9n8j4
[10:50:04] <labrador> NeoVoid[m], 
[10:50:21] <gtlsgamr> pystardust: mailing list is an alternative for the website
[10:50:23] <labrador> https://yewtu.be/watch?v=Cn8bCd9n8j4
[10:50:26] <NeoVoid[m]> just watching this mumble is good can we have text chat in there too?
[10:50:30] <gtlsgamr> we need to lose the whole ---- hosting thing
[10:50:47] <labrador> gtlsgamr, hosting is expensive
[10:50:56] <labrador> Lets just use free services where we can
[10:51:16] <labrador> Who do you think will pay 1000+ rupees for a domain
[10:51:30] <pystardust> i got the domain for 7 dollars
[10:51:43] <labrador> 525 huh
[10:51:46] <labrador> how long?
[10:51:55] <aryak> a yaer
[10:52:05] <labrador> yeah thats still pretty expensive
[10:57:34] <Tor[m]> @pystardust#2330 
[10:57:34] <Tor[m]> @gtlsgamr#2072 @[Neo Void]#2308 
[10:57:34] <Tor[m]> How will we be monetising except donations ? 
[10:57:46] <aryak> #?
[10:58:03] <aryak> why do we need that much
[10:58:04] <Tor[m]> Like where do we see the group doing
[10:58:18] <aryak> we need enough money to maintain server
[10:58:20] <aryak> thats all
[10:58:59] <Tor[m]> Tor[m]: What
[10:59:41] <NeoVoid[m]> > <@t0r:denshi.org> @pystardust#2330 
[10:59:41] <NeoVoid[m]> > @gtlsgamr#2072 @[Neo Void]#2308 
[10:59:41] <NeoVoid[m]> > How will we be monetising except donations ?
[10:59:41] <NeoVoid[m]> adsense? 😅
[11:00:06] <Tor[m]> Promoting gnulinux on bigtech ?
[11:00:33] <Tor[m]> Ha matlab logo ko waha se hi nikal ne ka hai
[11:01:24] <labrador> NeoVoid[m], not much money in ads
[11:01:32] <labrador> With gnu/linux folk
[11:01:46] <labrador> They all have hardened browsers with adblockers
[11:02:18] <Tor[m]> So we target " normies"
[11:02:22] <Tor[m]> But kaise
[11:03:06] <labrador> Normies hate us
[11:04:36] <NeoVoid[m]> people need reason to donate.
[11:04:36] <NeoVoid[m]> all the members of gnulinuxindia who have their github projects can kinda include those projects in site like showcasing them sorta so people will think about donating.
[11:04:36] <NeoVoid[m]> understand it like a all these projects came from gnulinux India umbrella like ibm or dell labs kinda thing.
[11:05:10] <labrador> >github
[11:05:14] <labrador> >gnu/linux
[11:05:20] <labrador> WhAt
[11:05:32] <labrador> but otherwise good idea
[11:06:04] <NeoVoid[m]1> just like fsf has their umbrella where they promote free libre softs and provide guidelines regarding privacy and sorta thing 
[11:06:17] <labrador> yeah
[11:06:40] <Tor[m]> labrador: Isliye toh wo log ko target karna hai
[11:06:43] <NeoVoid[m]1> gnulinuxindia can promote cli tools or suckless way of com,puting
[11:07:11] <labrador> yeah suckless is good
[11:07:31] <NeoVoid[m]1> first of all we need clear goal of what we gonna do with site
[11:07:50] <labrador> Make it a landing page for all things gnu/linux for india
[11:08:04] <labrador> Provide a lot of information
[11:08:07] <labrador> In one site
[11:08:13] <labrador> how's that?
[11:09:13] <NeoVoid[m]1> pystardust and bugswriter are already started promoting cli way. we can show peoples that cli is the "the original way" to do things
[11:09:41] <NeoVoid[m]1> labrador: yes
[11:10:46] <NeoVoid[m]1> we can provide tutorials guidelines. wikis and all sort of things
[11:12:11] <NeoVoid[m]1> once peoples see site with rich contents and worth donate they would beg to ask donate link
[11:12:16] <NightFury[m]> Yeh I think a lot of people don't know about other platforms like IRC matrix thing so good guide on that will be helpful
[11:14:19] <labrador> yeah
[11:15:47] <Arya[m]> <NeoVoid[m]1> "just like fsf has their umbrella..." <- we have a cgit
[11:15:57] <Arya[m]> we can open it up for people to host their projectrs
[11:16:01] <Arya[m]> like ytfzf or something
[11:16:21] <labrador> Also
[11:16:25] <labrador> operate a pastebin
[11:16:30] <Arya[m]> we can discuss on #gnulinuxindia-su on libera
[11:16:33] <Arya[m]> labrador: 0x0?
[11:16:37] <labrador> paste.gnli.org or something
[11:16:53] <labrador> people will associate our name
[11:16:53] <Arya[m]> TODO mailman and pastebin
[11:17:02] <Arya[m]> labrador: its usually gli.org
[11:17:03] <labrador> And might visit our main site too
[11:17:12] <Arya[m]> we dont have gli.org
[11:17:12] <Arya[m]> only gnulinuxindia.org
[11:17:21] <labrador> And is widely used and cheap to host
[11:17:26] <labrador> Best way advertise imho
[11:17:32] <labrador> way to*
[11:17:35] <Arya[m]> ig
[11:17:40] <Arya[m]> butwhy would they use this

[11:17:42] <Arya[m]> 0x0
[11:17:43] <Arya[m]> .st
[11:17:47] <Arya[m]> te official one
[11:18:01] <labrador> Man there are so many pastebins used by people
[11:18:15] <aryak> pastebin.com normies
[11:18:17] <labrador> Maybe we can make it usable over terminal
[11:18:22] <labrador> like termbin.com
[11:18:32] <aryak> cryptpad for privacy concious normies
[11:18:36] <labrador> yeah
[11:18:36] <aryak> and 0x0 for terminal chads
[11:18:42] <labrador> Thats a nice one
[11:18:43] <aryak> 0x0 is terminal based
[11:19:03] <labrador> you need to curl to it
