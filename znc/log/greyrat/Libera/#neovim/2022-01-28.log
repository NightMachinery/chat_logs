[06:47:04] <ppeb[m]> I have an autocmd that runs vim.lsp.buf.hover on cursor hold. If it opens the floating window sometimes it will, after a few seconds, be called again and then enter the floating window. I'm assuming that's the autocmd being run again. Is there a way to prevent it from entering or check if the window is already open?

[08:40:38] <ii14[m]> no, not really
[08:40:50] <ii14[m]> uniform function call depends on types, right?
[08:42:27] <ii14[m]> isn't uniform function call the thing that you define a free function and it can work as a method basically?
[08:43:00] <ii14[m]> anyways, in lua it looks up the method inside the table or metatable
[08:44:18] <Bowuigi[m]> ii14[m]: Yeah, you can also change the metatables of strings and tables
[08:44:55] <Bowuigi[m]> Those change the behaviour and can make `mytable + {1,2,3}` do something interesting
[08:45:07] <Bowuigi[m]> Not just adding, but most operations
[08:45:48] <Bowuigi[m]> Indexing, adding, removing, adding new indexes, accessing older ones, dividing, multiplying, {left,right} shifting and more
[08:45:56] <Bowuigi[m]> Pretty nice tbh
[08:46:31] <Bowuigi[m]> The only thing Lua lacks a lot and is hard to replace is a preprocessor
[08:46:51] <Bowuigi[m]> Otherwise you can play with tables and functions and get clever stuff working easily
[08:46:56] <ii14[m]> also function call. for example I came up with this neat syntax for a plugin manager: `Plug 'junegunn/fzf' { run = ':call fzf#install()' }`
[08:47:34] <Bowuigi[m]> Fairly simple to make
[08:47:57] <Bowuigi[m]> Just a function that takes a string and returns a function that takes a table with the settings
[08:48:06] <ii14[m]> yup
[08:48:44] <Bowuigi[m]> I used a similar workaround to make a working switch statement
[08:48:51] <Bowuigi[m]> miversen33-5: Wdym? What is it lacking?

[09:20:51] <felippemrFelippe> 👋 Does anybody know if I can disable syntax and theme painting when using :terminal?
[09:21:36] <felippemrFelippe> I was hoping to reduce drawing on top of the terminal as much as possible, if that is something.
[09:21:56] <felippemrFelippe> :terminal has been hanging a lot for me.
[09:22:29] <ii14[m]> not sure what do you mean
[09:22:44] <ii14[m]> there is no syntax highlighting in a terminal
[09:23:09] <ii14[m]> and theme is just a bunch of variables that define the 16 base colors
[09:23:26] <ii14[m]> plus background and foreground
[09:24:57] <felippemrFelippe> Yeah, that'
[09:25:00] <felippemrFelippe> * Yeah, that's what I thought.
[09:25:59] <ii14[m]> so you wanted to restrict it to just background and foreground color or what?
[09:26:20] <felippemrFelippe> I am asking bc my :terminal has been hanging a lot lately. using bash outside nvim works without any issues, but inside it just hangs forever. It got worse with the latest nightly.
[09:26:43] <ii14[m]> I doubt the library that neovim uses (libvterm iirc) supports that
[09:26:56] <ii14[m]> you could just lie in the TERM variable
[09:27:04] <ii14[m]> and make processes think you don't have color support
[09:27:17] <ii14[m]> but I doubt that would change much

[13:22:06] <hab[m]> Thanks
[13:22:07] <clason[m]> (or forked, brought up-to-date, and maintained)
[13:22:49] <clason[m]> `:h deprecated` will tell you what to do
[13:23:05] <hab[m]> Btw, this is my biggest complaint about neovim so far, it seems that breaking changes happen everytime I update my packages/neovim and need to spend some time working on fixing those instead of getting some work done :/
[13:23:09] <p00f> <arch-angel> "hmmmmm is literally invoking /..." <- does the clion thing output to stdout or format in-place?
[13:23:19] <arch-angel> it formats in place
[13:23:30] <clason[m]> hab[m]: To be fair, this need not happen -- nobody forces you to update.
[13:23:40] <arch-angel> unlike clang-format which outputs to stdout, p00f 
[13:23:46] <oush9[m]> hab[m]: I agree, that and unmaintained plugins. i find them after months.
[13:23:52] <p00f> arch-angel: then just write a command which calls it...
[13:24:09] <arch-angel> yeah, I use formatter.nvim
[13:24:30] <hab[m]> clason[m]: True, but I'd eventually need to update and have months of breaking change to fix then :D
[13:24:38] <clason[m]> Why do you need to update?
[13:24:43] <arch-angel> but, after it formats, the file is changed, I want nvim to autosave the file after the command has finished executing, p00f
[13:24:48] <oush9[m]> new features and bug fixes
[13:24:54] <clason[m]> Also, some breaking changes cancel out. And you'll give plugins time to adapt.
[13:25:03] <hab[m]> Well for example, telescope requires 0.6 now
[13:25:04] <sunjonSenghanBri> rough with the smooth?
[13:25:08] <clason[m]> oush9[m]: new features are not a _need_ 
[13:25:10] <sunjonSenghanBri> "I kinda wanted all smooth!"
[13:25:13] <p00f> arch-angel: then make said command save it
[13:25:17] <oush9[m]> sometimes they are
[13:25:20] <clason[m]> bugfix releases are not (or very rarely) breaking
[13:25:21] <arch-angel> how?
[13:25:30] <clason[m]> oush9[m]: sorry, that's not true
[13:25:36] <mjlbach[m]> hab[m]: That changed across a major release cycle (0.5 -> 0.6)
[13:25:36] <clason[m]> they might be a want
[13:25:47] <clason[m]> which you need to balance with your want for stability
[13:25:49] <oush9[m]> technically in that case nvim is not a need, only oxygen, water and food

[13:26:59] <clason[m]> oush9[m]: yes, that is pretty much my point. these complaints (which are common; I'm not singling you out) all make it sound like people are _forced_ to use it, or use certain plugins, or update constantly.
[13:27:02] <arch-angel> I honestly have no idea where to add the command that tells nvim to reload and save the file
[13:27:34] <oush9[m]> yeah, i didn't update for two months, then I did about a week ago and things broke. 
[13:27:34] <p00f> arch-angel: bruh formatter.nvim has a FormatWrite command
[13:27:54] <clason[m]> well, why did you update a week ago?
[13:27:56] <oush9[m]> i generally don't update a lot, but it depends /when/ breaking changes occur, and /when/ you update
[13:28:08] <mjlbach[m]> You should only use releases
[13:28:10] <clason[m]> breaking changes only occur when you update :)
[13:28:27] <oush9[m]> that's a bad argument
[13:28:31] <clason[m]> why?
[13:28:31] <oush9[m]> breaking changes only occur if you use software

[13:28:47] <p00f> rock stable
[13:28:49] <arch-angel> p00f, yeah but it's still the same, nvim still prompts me that the file has changed and warns me either to save or not
[13:29:01] <p00f> h u h
[13:29:03] <p00f> weird
[13:29:37] <clason[m]> oush9[m]: that is true, and also a possible solution
[13:29:47] <clason[m]> I'm just offering a more nuanced one
[13:30:07] <arch-angel> here it says "WARNING: The file has changed since reading it!!!" after :FormatWrite
[13:30:37] <oush9[m]> you have to update sometimes, unless you never update anything in the entire stack (os, editor, or plugins).
[13:30:45] <hab[m]> clason[m]: Well, I'd rather update my system and :PackerUpdate from time to time instead of adding a bunch of rules not to do so. I get that breaking changes/updates are necessary sometimes, but I would say that more often than not, plugins maintainers are pushing some which aren't. Not trying to be a dick there, I'm greatful for neovim and for the plugins I use, it just seems unnecessarily unstable sometimes.  
[13:30:46] <clason[m]> yes, pretty much
[13:31:08] <clason[m]> you don't update your OS often, do you?
[13:31:15] <oush9[m]> i do yes
[13:31:19] <hab[m]> Every week or so

[13:31:31] <oush9[m]> generally it doesn't break
[13:31:40] <oush9[m]> they do software versioning, and testing of all the packages. something that doesn't happen with nvimplugins
[13:31:58] <arch-angel> every week? I run it every time a new update comes out without checking if comes with breaking changes or not
[13:32:27] <arch-angel> i live past the edge

[13:33:20] <sunjonSenghanBri> then they're back at work, with real responsobilities the next day
[13:33:31] <clason[m]> hab[m]: I get where you are coming from, but a) cut maintainers some slack; they are hobbyists that have limited time and understandably prefer spending that on improving the plugin rather than devops and b) you might be wrong in thinking they're _unnecessarily_ unstable; most maintainers don't break stuff for the sake of it.
[13:33:36] <sunjonSenghanBri> everything you mention is something you can contribute yourself
[13:33:39] <oush9[m]> just drop support for plugins in nvim if they're so bad
[13:33:49] <p00f> bruh
[13:33:55] <sunjonSenghanBri> if you think a plugin really needs to be more stable, contribute tests
[13:34:12] <sunjonSenghanBri> you can't complain "I find it really frustrating that nobody is doing the extra work on my behalf!"
[13:34:17] <sunjonSenghanBri> I can't read it in any other way
[13:34:32] <oush9[m]> that's really the maintainer's responsibility tbh
[13:34:32] <clason[m]> no
[13:34:37] <clason[m]> they have zero responsibility
[13:34:46] <oush9[m]> they kinda do.
[13:34:53] <clason[m]> based on what contract?
[13:35:01] <bytie> once again those who contribute nothing have a lot of complaints
[13:35:03] <hab[m]> clason[m]: I get that, that's why I'm reserved when complaining about it, I'm just a bit conflicted about it.
[13:35:13] <clason[m]> read the license: all software is provided as-is, without guarantees
[13:35:39] <oush9[m]> ethics. you can't offer someone in good faith without at least warning people that something is crap, will break, has broken, or doesn't work.
[13:36:04] <clason[m]> okay, you are hereby officially warned that all software is crap, will break, or sometimes doesn't work
[13:36:09] <clason[m]> you can quote me on that.
[13:36:11] <oush9[m]> like, if i sold you a car, but forgot to tell you that the breaks don't work.
[13:36:31] <p00f> oush9[m]: literally all the licenses have "THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED AS-IT-IS, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND" in caps
[13:36:33] <clason[m]> so, where is the contract for the sale of Neovim to you
[13:36:34] * sunjonSenghanBri gives you your money back
[13:36:37] <sunjonSenghanBri> but wait!
[13:36:53] <clason[m]> yep, we do have a money-back-no-questions-asked policy!
[13:37:07] <hab[m]> oush9[m]: Well, I'm not sure that applies to voluntary work
[13:37:21] <oush9[m]> warranty doesn't imply lack of ethical responsibility. a fair warning that something has broken isn't a lot to ask. or a system in place to warn users of breakages
[13:37:31] <clason[m]> yes.
[13:37:38] <clason[m]> you do get that
[13:37:39] <p00f> there is a system btw
[13:37:43] <oush9[m]> warranty implies lagal responsibility
[13:37:44] <p00f> packer lets you know
[13:37:48] <sunjonSenghanBri> https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2022/01/24/logj4-security-inquiry-response-required/
[13:37:49] <clason[m]> most plugins use conventional commits, and packer will warn you when you update with a breaking change
[13:37:51] <sunjonSenghanBri> read that
[13:38:04] <sunjonSenghanBri> that was from last week, to the curl maintainer
[13:38:12] <sunjonSenghanBri> (an old C64 demo scener from Horizon)
[13:38:37] <oush9[m]> i do read those. it's still a little lacking. with conventional commits you can include automatic semver
[13:38:50] <clason[m]> no, that's orthogonal
[13:39:00] <oush9[m]> it's triangular actually
[13:39:32] <clason[m]> and most plugins are on zero major version, anyway, so that buys you nothing
[13:40:10] <mjlbach[m]> oush9[m]: neovim is crap don't use it
[13:40:10] <oush9[m]> ahh well, breaks don't work, just don't use them. gotcha
[13:40:31] <clason[m]> exactly. just don't use them.
[13:40:32] <sunjonSenghanBri> "gotcha!"

[13:43:38] <clason[m]> (which I do think is useful information)

[13:44:14] <oush9[m]> no, my words are only an opinion
[13:44:18] <oush9[m]> it's okay to have one
[13:44:32] <oush9[m]> don't worry about it
[13:44:33] <sunjonSenghanBri> I always find this kind of weird, I assume that being an nvim user
[13:44:48] <sunjonSenghanBri> you're either a software developer or an author, with the likelyhood it's the former
[13:45:06] <clason[m]> it is, but that doesn't mean other people have to consider it a reasonable opinion, and sharing it is an invitation to  tell you why

[13:45:44] <sunjonSenghanBri> do you improve it?

[13:51:32] <oush9[m]> i see, well i meant no disrespect.
[13:51:32] <p00f> you shared your opinion, others told you why your opinion was wrong

[13:53:39] <clason[m]> So, Fridays, amirite?
[13:54:01] <ii14[m]> I'm not even a maintainer and I got annoyed. I just don't get what the issue is, nvim is not a web browser, you don't have to update it every day. use stable if you don't like breaking changes
[13:54:03] <clason[m]> Seriously (mod hat on), let's drop this topic
[13:55:01] <oush9[m]> well the whole "i got annoyed" bit doesn't make sense. i just said breaking changes happen, and that /sometimes/ you /have/ to update. i don;t think that warrants 5 or 6 people ganging around me to circlejerk in my face

Just using NeoVim, but seeing that the event is triggered multiple times. I'm only seeing this on my work laptop: Ubuntu 18.04 (Gnome), not on my personal laptop which is running KDE. I've tried to triage by using different terminal emulators, shells and without using tmux.
[16:05:35] <ironhouzi[m]> ..and ofc with a bare `init.vim` .
[16:06:01] <ironhouzi[m]> ..or almost bare: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/14572

[18:15:12] <sunjonSenghanBri> I mean, why didn't you ask what was flaky about codelldb? or why ii14 chose termdebug over shiny new DAP?
[18:17:01] <sunjonSenghanBri> if researching interactively was going to be better, stating your preferences/requirements and following up with questions where something's not explained or vague, would help
[18:18:03] <p00f> sunjonSenghanBri: slight correction, puremourning said cpptools was flaky, not codelldb
[18:18:16] <p00f> he in fact recommended codelldb
[18:19:21] <sunjonSenghanBri> correct.
[18:19:29] <p00f> ii14 which bugs do you normally debug for which termdebug is better?
[18:19:29] <sunjonSenghanBri> https://paste.sh/rnBQMjkr#7Rr9gtfLZyU21hhdPTo8RpmO
[18:19:35] <sunjonSenghanBri> I wasn't trying to bust his balls
[18:19:51] <sunjonSenghanBri> my point was that now we've done the interactive way, it could have been better
[18:20:29] <sunjonSenghanBri> what I was pointing out as missing, and kind of required if you're genuinely interested in the answers to questions you ask
[18:20:47] <p00f> sunjonSenghanBri: dw, i said that because someone might jump to a conclusion reading that one message
[18:21:00] <sunjonSenghanBri> would make for the basics of a DAP comparison, like the LSP one linked earlier
[18:21:36] <sunjonSenghanBri> I didn't go that direction, as 'it'll need keeping up to date/flavor-of-the-month/you should choose what's right for you', etc etc
[18:23:47] <ii14[m]> buggy bugs. idk, just back when I was trying out DAP the vscodelldb was incomplete, with no pretty printing for STL and I didn't know how to run lldb commands, so I was basically crippled. termdebug is simply gdb in a terminal emulator, but you can set break points, eval stuff under cursor etc
[18:26:17] <ii14[m]> and I don't feel the need to switch. if anything, it'd be for another gdb plugin, not something like dap
[18:26:37] <sunjonSenghanBri> "does what I need", is a good enough sales pitch
[18:26:43] <p00f> yes i'm not saying termdebug is bad, it's just that my C++ usecase is mostly sport programming where i'm mostly debugging wrong answers. entering "step" is tedious
[18:27:10] <ii14[m]> I might try DAP again if I ever need to debug something that isn't c and c++, but in other languages I got away with printf debugging so far
[18:27:43] <ii14[m]> termdebug has :Step or :Over, you can map that
[18:28:02] <p00f> p00f: it might be different when you're debugging real stuff
[18:28:06] <p00f> ii14[m]: oh nice
[18:28:11] <egy> is there's anything like vimspector for neovim ? (ik vimspector works great in neovim, but was looking for something in Lua)
[18:28:16] <ii14[m]> or enter the gdb window and just press enter to repeat last command
[18:28:22] <ii14[m]> like you normally would in gdb
[18:28:49] <ii14[m]> yes, we're talking about it right now, DAP
[18:29:27] <p00f> thanks ii14, you've convinced me
[18:29:30] <ii14[m]> it's not quite like vimspector, but it's what most people use nowadays I think
[18:30:15] <p00f> p00f: but then there is nvim-dap-virtual-text which is just sweet for me
[18:30:22] <puremouron> out of curiosity, why does it being in lua make a difference to you? is there a real usage reason or just language fetishism?

[18:53:56] <clason[m]> they're at Vim9 now -- eat your heart out, Python3!
[18:54:14] <puremouron> my question was serious actually, if there is a part of vimspector that's a friction i'd like to understand it, if it's childish debate about language fetish, i'm not interested
[18:55:08] <puremouron> i was perhaps expecting an answer like "nvim-dap has a better api for customisation and works better with $other_thing because of that"
[18:55:09] <puremouron> which i would completely understand
[18:55:09] <jaawerth[m]> as big a fan as I am of lua as the base language, I imagine it's hard to write a lua plugin that keeps vim compat since you'd have to keep track of all the way-more-integrated-than-just-bindings apias you make use of
[18:55:12] <puremouron> and is likely true

[18:57:57] <ii14[m]> sure
[18:57:59] <jaawerth[m]> any language is fine, really. vimscript may be slow but if you're just setting up and managing async job channels, it ain't gonna be the bottleneck
[18:58:16] <ii14[m]> perl got removed from nvim I believe
[19:00:05] <puremouron> wasn't ctrl-t ruby?
[19:00:06] <jaawerth[m]> with all the lua shiny we often forget that to the rpc you can use any language anyway
[19:00:38] <Bowuigi[m]> jaawerth[m]: Neovim plugins in Malbolge lol
[19:00:38] <ii14[m]> yeah but you're adding a dependency
[19:01:07] <ii14[m]> and lua will just work in every neovim
[19:01:56] <ii14[m]> I don't think that was grammatically correct but whatever
[19:02:47] <bfredl> I suppose the fetish is that if you have a "nvim" binary you already have a lua binary (as nvim statically links to lua), while the same is not necesarily true for python. 
[19:03:22] <ii14[m]> bfredl: not dynamically?
[19:03:41] <bfredl> I mean, the BIG distros will ship will some kind of python3-neovim package, but this not guaranted, while any distro which ships neovim already ships the lua inside neovim..
[19:04:03] <bfredl> ii14[m]: as opposed to what? python might be available or not avaibable.
[19:04:05] <puremouron> that might be true, but i don't think it's the reason the person who mentioned it had in mind
[19:04:34] <bfredl> puremouron: it is of course _also_ true that lua sounds cooler :]

[19:04:56] <clason[m]> only problem is it doesn't have a mascot
[19:05:10] <ii14[m]> bfredl: I mean dynamically linked
[19:05:14] <egy> i thought vimspector was written in vimscript as well
[19:05:25] <p00f> ii14 one last thing, is there no `g:loaded_termdebug`? I get "no such event TermdebugStartPre" when i write the autocmd
[19:05:29] <ii14[m]> or does it depend on build options
[19:05:31] <p00f> so i wanted to guard it
[19:05:36] <egy> trying it now, lovely plugin :)
[19:05:48] <ii14[m]> p00f: termdebug checks if `:Termdebug` command exists
[19:05:51] <bfredl> ii14[m]: sure but dynamic linking is 100% a distro problem and 0% an "our" problem
[19:05:56] <puremouron> bfredl: yeah, but 1-based indexes? come on. that's a <del>cardinal</del> ordinal sin.
[19:05:59] <p00f> ii14[m]: thanks
[19:06:20] <skebangaskebang4> FWIW it wasn't me who mentioned I wanted vimspoector but in lua, I was just offering my own 2c 
[19:06:28] <ii14[m]> you need to `:packadd` it first p00f 
[19:06:32] <bfredl> it is the distros job to make sure that `nvim` binary always finds `libluajit_BULLSHIT-0.5.1-0.2.3.x.so.whatever`
[19:06:51] <p00f> yes i know how to atleast start termdebug :)
[19:07:17] <bfredl> puremouron: it is even better, lua does not even have real arrays
[19:07:17] <ii14[m]> I have this hack to lazy load it: https://github.com/ii14/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/nvim/commands.vim#L87-L95
[19:07:21] <bfredl> so if you prefer -1 based indexing?
[19:07:22] <bfredl> sure.

[19:19:52] <ironhouzi[m]> Does anyone use Kitty as their terminal emulator? It fixed a problem with focus events not working on my work laptop, but it opens a can of worms in terms of playing nicely with tmux :|
[19:20:24] <ironhouzi[m]> ..was hoping someone could enlighten me on how to deal with tmux..
[19:20:50] <sunjonSenghanBri> you're using it locally. For what?
[19:21:02] <sunjonSenghanBri> tmux, that is.
[19:21:31] <ii14[m]> for the lulz
[19:21:55] <sunjonSenghanBri> I mean, it's been the source of both of his issues
[19:22:04] <ironhouzi[m]> I use it for a bunch of stuff .. and yes, definitely locally. I use it because it does everything I need from a tiling window manager.
[19:22:07] <ironhouzi[m]> ..and perhaps more..
[19:22:29] <sunjonSenghanBri> have you explored kitty's split options, or a real WM?
[19:22:34] <p00f> kitty does a lot, except saving sessions
[19:22:39] <p00f> why not try kitty
[19:23:22] <ii14[m]> linux ttys is all you need actually
[19:23:22] <ironhouzi[m]> scrollback buffer .. session saving was something I was planning on looking into, but it's not too late to avoid it .. also easily copy pasting text using the keyboard is also nice..
[19:23:51] <p00f> kitty can do all of those
[19:23:51] <sunjonSenghanBri> sessions make less sense to me locally. Scrollback buffer on tmux is very nice
[19:23:58] <sunjonSenghanBri> there are kitty alternatives
[19:24:02] <ironhouzi[m]> ..but I've never liked the TERM issues that comes with tmux ofc
[19:24:27] <ironhouzi[m]> ..and now I also read about how messy the implementation is..
[19:25:15] <sunjonSenghanBri> yep, I'm not trying to convert people, but if you're new to it, you might not be aware that it's historically been the root cause of a lot of vim/neovim issues, where the user hasn't known the magic config voodoo to have everything work in harmony
[19:25:52] <ironhouzi[m]> OK, perhaps I should have a look at how kitty can replace most of the tmux features.. ..yes, I have PTSD from all the voodoo..
[19:26:00] <sunjonSenghanBri> as moving to kitty fixed one 'known unknown' problem, you might as well see what else it has to offer, before doing the tmux contortions 
[19:26:09] <jaawerth[m]> I use kitty, but I can't speak to tmux integration since I only use tmux locally for things I might want to detach and attach to from other machines
[19:26:25] <sunjonSenghanBri> I started on something quite cool for dtach
[19:26:46] <sunjonSenghanBri> but got sidetracked..
[19:26:52] <ironhouzi[m]> ..but I'm reading that ssh'ing into a remote server can be problematic with kitty, as the TERM isn't recognized by most systems..
[19:27:23] <ii14[m]> sunjonSenghanBri: I got sidetracked like four or five times this month
[19:28:13] <p00f> ironhouzi[m]: there's an ssh kitten which copies over the terminfo
[19:28:19] <p00f> kitty +kitten ssh

[19:29:32] <p00f> the month is about to end

[21:26:18] <bfredl> LSP is not a "thing", it is just an inteface to a bunch of things :]

[21:27:34] <bfredl> still,  "Neovim's LSP integration" is gonna have issues depending on the specific server.
[21:27:40] <LyndsySimon> I don't regularly use LSP servers other than pyright, so I don't know if this was caused by the LSP server implementation I'm using, neovim itself, or perhaps even tmux/zsh/kitty/macOS
[21:28:03] <clason[m]> I mean, servers are gonna consume resources

[21:28:27] <clason[m]> and they need to be spawned to do so
[21:28:37] <LyndsySimon> bfredl: you jest, but weirder things have happened :)
[21:29:22] <bfredl> yes. so mention relevant information helps with pinning down the weirdness.
[21:29:42] <bfredl> LSP is a protocol (or at least, so claims to be), so mentioning both ends of that protocol is a good start.
[21:30:37] <LyndsySimon> I get it. I didn't provide a minimal reproducible case. I'll also point out that I wasn't asking this channel to debug my particular issue - I was beginning the process of debugging it myself by checking if there was perhaps a known issue with one of the tools in the environment.

[21:32:38] <clason[m]> asking people to click through random links for information you could just as easily have put in the comment as well will rub some people the wrong way.

[21:33:24] <sunjonSenghanBri> blame me
[21:33:29] <bfredl> " LSP processes spawned by neovim consuming resources" is not a very direct way to ask "pyright  spawned by neovim is consuming a lot resources" TBH
[21:33:50] <clason[m]> It's Rant Friday, I'd say.
[21:33:58] <bfredl> "LSP processes" is not a meaningful category for debugging stuff, how much both we and you ask it would be, sory

[21:34:00] <LyndsySimon> > asking people to click through random links
[21:34:00] <LyndsySimon> That's fair. I'm using a graphical client that posts the link contents inline, so it's not as apparent from my perspective the barrier that others have to seeing the contents.

[21:35:37] <LyndsySimon> sunjonSenghanBri: Yeah, I saw that. My guess is that pyright is to blame. I was thinking that because I didn't have a neovim session running at the time, and that neovim started pyright, that neovim should have been responsible for killing it before exit.

[21:36:24] <LyndsySimon> bfredl: For what it's worth, I'm not at all upset. Mildly amused and a little surprised by the apparent tone at the moment, but not upset.
[21:37:07] <LyndsySimon> I'm one of those weird people that actually _misses_ the "RTFM or GTFO" culture of the past in *nix support outlets.
[21:37:16] <clason[m]> It only asks them to shut down (nicely); if servers ignore that, they stick around of course.
[21:37:43] <bfredl> we are just aiming to teach people to be good chatizens as well as help with specific issues :] 
[21:38:10] <bfredl> which here is not "RTFM or GTFO", but more like providing relevant info upfront instead of being vauge
[21:38:16] <LyndsySimon> Good to know. I assumed neovim would send SIGTERM to the LSP server before shutting down.
[21:38:19] <clason[m]> (sometimes first one, then the other ;))
[21:38:45] <LyndsySimon> bfredl: I didn't say it was like that here.
[21:38:49] <clason[m]> Neovim is very idealistic :)
[21:39:19] <clason[m]> It pretends that LSP is actually a well-defined and properly implemented protocol.
[21:39:34] <clason[m]> (Because otherwise, madness looms.)
[21:40:28] <bfredl> i didn't say you said it was either.
[21:40:29] <bfredl> and so on and so on :]
[21:40:45] <sunjonSenghanBri> LyndsySimon:libera.chat: I'd make a process watcher and run it on cron or something
[21:40:46] <LyndsySimon> FWIW, I liked vim before neovim was on the scene. While I tried to use it full time repeatedly, I kept running into poorly documented issues and having to either abandon that approach or try to fix them myself. As my skills grew, I realized that vim was ridiculously crufty and hard to reason about. Neovim has done an incredible job addressing that issue.
[21:41:01] <sunjonSenghanBri> do your `ps`, check for zombies or dead PPID's
[21:41:23] <bfredl> we are trying to do our best to remove cruft, yes :)
[21:41:34] <clason[m]> we even use uncrustify!
[21:41:38] <LyndsySimon> I have far fewer issues with it, and I've been using it for about three years now as my editor/IDE. The only times I open anything else are when I'm onboarding a very junior developer or working in a language where I don't have a lot of experience and don't plan to stay long.
[21:41:42] <bfredl> very soon, we might even remove python2 !
[21:41:47] <LyndsySimon> Good! :P
[21:43:21] <sunjonSenghanBri> and by 'process watcher', I mean simple bash script
[21:43:28] <LyndsySimon> I've said many times that "Python is my first and true love when it comes to languages". I can talk about 2 vs 3 and all of the stuff that goes with it for as long as you'd like - but at the end of the day, 2.x is EOL. 3.x isn't just the future, 2.x is now firmly in the past.
[21:46:16] <bfredl> imagine running ":python some_py3_stuff" and it just works.. might come to a neovim near you soon!
[21:46:22] <LyndsySimon> Here's a random thought I just had: A large portion of this channel seems to be people struggling with configuration and plugins. I wonder if  it wouldn't be a good idea for someone to have a paid "review my neovim dotfiles" service?
[21:46:48] <clason[m]> I think those are on Twitch.
[21:46:51] <LyndsySimon> Oh?

[21:47:07] <sunjonSenghanBri> I'd thought that it could be automated
[21:47:40] <sunjonSenghanBri> a "script doctor" that you could point to a repo. and it'd look for common misconfigurations
[21:47:42] <clason[m]> well, stylua is a first step
[21:48:01] <clason[m]> I'm sure someone could make a neovim config linter
[21:48:11] <clason[m]> put it in null-ls
[21:48:18] <sunjonSenghanBri> then they're have to maintain it and keep it bug-free

[21:51:46] <mjlbach[m]> <clason[m]> "Neovim does not kill servers (as..." <- it does kill servers
[21:51:50] <clason[m]> I stand corrected.
[21:52:07] <clason[m]> But that's a fairly recent change?
[21:52:28] <mjlbach[m]> nope
[21:52:54] <clason[m]> well, I misremembered.

[21:54:46] <clason[m]> gotcha
[21:54:50] <sunjonSenghanBri> https://a.uguu.se/gLEdaPwj.jpg
[21:56:15] <LyndsySimon> clason, mjlbach - are you primarily employed to work on neovim, or is it purely personal motivation?
[21:56:48] <clason[m]> just a hobby
[21:56:52] <LyndsySimon> Relatedly, is there an easy way for users to contribute to funding the continuing work on neovim?
[21:57:01] <clason[m]> yes!
[21:57:09] <clason[m]> https://github.com/sponsors/neovim
[21:57:30] <LyndsySimon> clason: That's honestly amazing. I've done quite a bit of F/OSS work  - some for pay, some on my own - but I can't seem to really "connect" deeply enough with any specific codebase to keep doing it over time.
[21:57:38] <mjlbach[m]> LyndsySimon: lol no, I only work on neovim because I use it (and not so much recently)
[21:57:52] <mjlbach[m]> (not so much working on it)
[21:57:55] <StephanSeitz[m]> clason[m]: https://www.pinterest.com/pin/100838479136325771/
[21:57:57] <clason[m]> there are no full-time employees for Neovim (as a long-term job), but people do get funded for, say, a month of full-time work

[21:58:13] <LyndsySimon> Perfect. As may arbitrary microtransactions as I already have draining my bank account, one more that actually supports something important to me won't hurt.
[21:58:17] <clason[m]> LyndsySimon: the people make the difference
[21:58:35] <sunjonSenghanBri> neovim is a special project
[21:58:47] <clason[m]> StephanSeitz[m]: I think that book needs an update
[21:58:51] <clason[m]> weekday pants are now optional, doo
[21:58:52] <clason[m]> s/doo/too/
[21:59:11] <LyndsySimon> I can see that. I feel like I'm much better at those types of interactions than I once was, but pretty much any interaction drains energy from me.
[22:00:17] <StephanSeitz[m]> sunjonSenghanBri: It's because you use it everyday so you'll experience every bug/improvement
[22:01:19] <clason[m]> and people are genuinely enthusiastic
[22:01:32] <clason[m]> and Neovim has lots of different corners, so you can focus on things you like

[22:08:13] <clason[m]> Not at the moment.

[22:14:30] <clason[m]> There's also legal issues; paying some known long-standing contributor for a month of Neovim dev between jobs is one thing, but sending money (or promise to do so) to some drive-by contributor can get thorny.
[22:14:54] <clason[m]> (Can be handled, of course. Just requires some setting up properly.)
[22:16:17] <bfredl> we tried the "bounty" pattern some years ago and it didn't work out really well IIRC (compared to just "donate to support neovim")
