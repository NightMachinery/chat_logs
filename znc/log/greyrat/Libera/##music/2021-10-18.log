[21:06:59] <morlog> get tired easy?
[21:07:07] <morlog> you need iron
[21:07:16] <murthy> Yes
[21:07:26] <murthy> Doctor gave me iron supplements
[21:07:30] <morlog> using cast iron cookware can help speed up getting it back into your system
[21:07:32] <murthy> morlog: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_deficiency
[21:07:33] <Janet> ^ Iron deficiency, or sideropenia, is the state in which a body lacks enough iron to supply its needs. Iron is present in all cells in the human body and has several vital functions, such as carrying oxygen to the tissues from the lungs...
[21:07:42] <murthy> morlog: yes
[21:07:50] <morlog> im well aware of that condition
[21:08:01] <murthy> I came across something that may affect you too
[21:08:05] <morlog> red meat is the best dietary source
[21:08:29] <murthy> Edit
[21:08:29] <murthy> Possible reasons that athletics may contribute to lower iron levels includes mechanical hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells from physical impact)
[21:08:47] <murthy> Something called mechanical hemolysis
[21:09:21] <murthy>  Mechanical hemolysis is most likely to occur in high-impact sports, especially among long-distance runners who experience "foot-strike hemolysis" from the repeated impact of their feet with the ground.
[21:09:25] <morlog> the kind of bicycling i do is a low to no impact
[21:09:44] <murthy> No I am thinking about your drumming
[21:09:46] <morlog> shin splints
[21:09:52] <morlog> oh
[21:09:59] <morlog> my hands are in good shape
[21:10:42] <murthy> Haematuria in athletes is most likely to occur in those that undergo repetitive impacts on the body, particularly affecting the feet (such as running on a hard road, or Kendo) and hands (e.g. Conga or Candombe drumming). 
[21:10:46] <murthy> See
[21:10:56] <murthy> They are talking about drumming
[21:11:09] <murthy> morlog: take appropriate measures
[21:11:33] <morlog> i have a lifetime of conditioning
[21:11:45] <murthy> I know
[21:11:56] <murthy> Just something I came across

[21:12:11] <murthy> Nice
[21:13:50] <murthy> SteppenwolfVM: I am baffled to know about Haematuria and drumming

[21:27:19] <murthy> The iron supplement is increasing my appetite. idk if this is just today, let me see if this happens tomorrow too
[21:28:41] <macrobat> I don't think it has that effect
[21:29:01] <murthy> Oh
[21:29:11] <morlog> iron is what helps your red blood cells carry oxygen
[21:29:19] <murthy> Yes
[21:29:23] <morlog> more oxygen means more energy
[21:29:29] <morlog> more energy needs more fuel
[21:29:47] <murthy> Yes

[23:37:17] <murthy> SteppenwolfVM: Possible reasons that athletics may contribute to lower iron levels includes mechanical hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells from physical impact)
[23:38:25] <murthy> SteppenwolfVM: Haematuria in athletes is most likely to occur in those that undergo repetitive impacts on the body, particularly affecting the feet (such as running on a hard road, or Kendo) and hands (e.g. Conga or Candombe drumming).
[23:39:22] <murthy> SteppenwolfVM: it seems there is a possibility that drummer are that the possibility of getting Anemia from mechanical hemolysis
[23:39:48] <murthy> Oops
[23:40:54] <murthy> It seems there is a possibility of drummers getting Anemia by mechanical hemolysis
[23:41:15] <murthy> Particularly if vegan people don't take appropriate measures
[23:43:54] <murthy> morlog: do you think this is why people started using sticks with drums instead of hands?
