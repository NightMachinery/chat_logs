[01:34:04] <babyface> does youtube do video post processing or is it just me?
[01:34:40] <babyface> or maybe the post processing is in the browser?
[01:34:59] <JEEB> youtube does do audio processing in the browser
[01:35:03] <JEEB> like volume poking etc
[01:35:09] <JEEB> as far as I can tell, various other places do that too
[01:35:48] <JEEB> since I've sometimes grabbed content via youtube-dl and that has been f.ex. "loud as hell"
[01:36:08] <JEEB> nicovideo at least seems to do it looking at that result.

[01:42:53] <furq> there's a "volume/normalized" entry in the youtube stats for nerds window
[01:43:06] <furq> so it sure looks like they're doing it on playback
[01:44:14] <JEEB> yup
[01:44:34] <furq> one thing youtube does not do is deinterlacing, and maybe some day the bbc will figure that out too

[02:22:25] <Hello71> volume seems much easier because you usually only want to set it once, and even if you want to do it a lot it's just one number to fiddle
[02:23:18] <JEEB> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ConvolverNode/normalize

[02:25:09] <JEEB> but whatever they do, it seems relatively clear that they're doing *something* since if you download the underlying actual media it can be quite a bit louder
[02:25:46] <furq> i assume they do some denoising or similar before encoding
[02:26:10] <JEEB> of course with youtube it's also possible they did it in the transcode and just show the normalization info in the player for the lulz
[02:26:27] <JEEB> but eh, it sure seems that there's at least some sort of volume adjustment going on in the web players

[03:43:08] <kepstin> youtube does loudness measurement using ebu r128 algorithm (14 LUFS reference) during file encoding on the server, and sends metadata to the client. the volume adjustment is done on playback, indeed by just adjusting the volume of the html media element
[03:43:30] <kepstin> they only reduce volume - you can't set volume on an html media element to >100% :)
[03:43:50] <kepstin> -14 LUFS reference, missed the minus sign, oops.
[03:44:55] <kepstin> I actually have youtube-dl convert all files to mp4 after downloading, then i add replaygain tags to them (which mpv can use)
[03:45:03] <kepstin> it works, heh

[07:18:11] <cod1r> btw do you know why my hls stream won't play the second mp4 fragment but VLC media plays my hls stream just fine?
[07:25:37] <cod1r> or I guess it won't play the next fragment but only plays whatever fragment is requested first
[07:25:59] <cod1r> like the second fragment plays if I remove the first fragment from the m3u8 manifest

[16:17:10] <linetrace> having an issue merging two sndio audio sources, as follows:
[16:17:12] <linetrace> ffmpeg -thread_queue_size 512 -f sndio -i snd/0 -thread>
[16:17:34] <linetrace> ffmpeg -thread_queue_size 512 -f sndio -i snd/0 -thread_queue_size 512 -f sndio -i snd/0.mon -filter_complex "[0]volume=1.0,aformat=channel_layouts=stereo[l];[1]volume=1.0,aformat=channel_layouts=stereo[m];[l][m]amerge=inputs=2[a]" -map "[a]" -c:a aac -f flv file.flv
[16:18:06] <linetrace> I only end up with audio from the first source, but if I record each of the inputs individually it records them fine
[16:18:51] <furq> you probably want amix, not amerge
[16:18:56] <furq> amerge with two stereo inputs will give a quad output
[16:19:10] <linetrace> furq: ooh, good to know, let me test that
[16:21:07] <linetrace> and that seems to work, many thanks, furq!

[18:13:00] <mindfreeze> Hi,
[18:13:00] <mindfreeze> I was trying to demux a mxf file from a sony camera,
[18:13:00] <mindfreeze> https://paste.debian.net/1204574/
[18:13:00] <mindfreeze> Looks ike it is not possible
[18:13:10] <mindfreeze> is there any workaround to demux the mxf files
[18:13:31] <mindfreeze> one relevant ticket I found was
[18:13:31] <mindfreeze> https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/3350
[18:14:23] <JEEB> fun, so the MXF file is not advertising whatever the video stream is in any way that is understood by libavformat :P
[18:14:54] <mindfreeze> strange string ^^
[18:15:17] <mindfreeze> IIRc thre was some ffmpeg moded with some broadcast tools back then
[18:15:24] <mindfreeze> maybe need tof ind that and test
[18:15:47] <JEEB> do you know what is in there btw?
[18:15:52] <mindfreeze> https://code.google.com/archive/p/ffmbc
[18:16:01] <mindfreeze> ah this
[18:16:31] <JEEB> anyways, I would recommend looking into it with either some mxfdump tool or mediainfo, to see if any of those can tell you what that might be
[18:17:21] <mindfreeze> JEEB: https://paste.debian.net/1204576/
[18:17:21] <mindfreeze> the mediainfo
[18:18:04] <JEEB> Format                                   : 0E060D0302020100-0E06040102060501
[18:18:04] <JEEB> Codec ID                                 : 0E060D0302020100-0E06040102060501
[18:18:07] <JEEB> whatever that is :)
[18:18:13] <JEEB> so mediainfo doesn't know either
[18:18:23] <furq> i thought everyone was using 0E060D0302020100-0E06040102060502 nowadays
[18:19:22] <mindfreeze> JEEB: BTW is this home page of mxflib

[18:36:29] <Burrr> Hi guys, i've a question. I'm using a consumer type dell laptop with Ubuntu server 20.04 (no GUI) on it, I've attached an TV via HDMI to the laptop and right now I see the same (terminal) on my laptop aswell as on my tv
[18:36:54] <Burrr> now i want to catch an rtsp stream from my ip camera and pipe this via the hdmi to my tv
[18:39:37] <DHE> sounds more like a job for a video player like mpv
[18:41:13] <Burrr> okay cool thx, i'll look into that, do you have any further tips/directions?
[18:42:12] *** Joins: ITD4004 (~ITD4004@187.61.233.248)
[18:42:56] <klaxa> you might want at least some rudimentary graphics acceleration
[18:47:29] <DHE> playing video without X11/Wayland is possible direct to the framebuffer driver, but I don't know what the performance would be like there, or if said acceleration would work
[18:47:58] <DHE> installing a GUI might be a good idea here. it would open more optinos
[18:48:01] <DHE> *options
[18:48:54] <Burrr> ah yeah exactly, that was a bit of my concern as well, although i'm trying to find lighest options so to say
[18:50:30] <Burrr> any tips on what GUI would be suitable for this job? Since the laptop is really only meant to be a printserver, pihole and this "transcoder"(? is this the right word) from rtsp stream to hdmi output on my tv
[18:51:31] <Burrr> and maybe some other small services but at least nothing that needs a gui
[18:54:13] <DHE> it's not like you'll be using the GUI. don't need to install a web browser, etc. really you just want X11 running with the right drivers loaded
[18:54:29] <DHE> what's the going lightweight GUI these days? is it still xfce4 ?
[18:56:37] <Burrr> ah yeah, thats exactly my first thoughts were but i'm a bit new to running my own devices on linux so lots of times I have a hard time to look in the right directions :)
[18:57:12] <Burrr> I wont be using all that stuff so only need the drivers, i tried installing some X11 packedges but i guess that's not enough?
[19:00:55] <furq> you don't need x11 for mpv but i guess the ubuntu package depends on it anyway
[19:00:58] <klaxa> installing a desktop environment should pull in all the dependencies, maybe give openbox a try
[19:01:10] *** Joins: linjie (~linjie@58.247.210.251)

[19:02:11] <klaxa> then again this was years ago
[19:08:18] <Burrr> thanks guys, just a "though of concept" from my side but would it be possible to install the graphics drivers in my present setup only to pipe out any graphical stuff to the HDMI port?
[19:08:55] <DHE> this getting out of the scope of ffmpeg pretty quick.
[19:09:49] <DHE> what we're suggesting is to avoid doing upscaling (eg: 720p -> 1080p) in software, and if at all possible avoid video decoding (eg: h264) in software. modern GPUs do this for you, but a terminal probably doesn't do that.

[19:16:00] <Burrr> okay cool, maybe im a bit in over my head here , I though I read somewhere ffmpeg could catch rtsp stream and pipe that out again but I feel like my view was a bit simplistic :D

[21:59:13] <kepstin> acagastya: best guess is that the segment you've selected is either too short so that it doesn't find the start of a gop, or is outside the range of the input file
[21:59:20] <kepstin> that error means that the output file is empty
[21:59:49] <acagastya> gop?

[22:16:15] <Terrence> Does anyone happen to know where I can find additional documentation on parameters that a filter accepts and changes in metadata? I'm trying to use aselect for an audio file, but after filtering the entire AVFormatContetx nothing seems to happen
