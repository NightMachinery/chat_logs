[07:02:36] <clothespin> i have six cores
[07:03:01] <clothespin> sbcl reported that to me
[07:03:24] <lotuseater> so one core is just 2/3 of its transistors physically :D

[11:33:39] <lotuseater> yes
[11:33:52] <lotuseater> and no, not just biological containments
[11:34:38] <ln43> ok but proteins are well known to work in particular with defined ligands

[11:36:05] <ln43> if the contaminant has not a dipole moment then is almost impossible for them to act

[11:36:39] *** Joins: kakuhen_ (~kakuhen@user/kakuhen)
[11:37:25] <ln43> yes basically because there is not electrostatic force that is acting
[11:37:30] <ln43> or not ?
[11:38:08] <ln43> calculation of the dipole moment it's not so easy
[11:38:25] <ln43> or quadrupole

[11:43:07] <lotuseater> i bet he means it the way as it's done by CL
[11:43:20] <ln43> ok, it depends on how you'd like to access the elements inside
[11:44:24] <selwyn> i did it the lazy way
[11:44:34] <lotuseater> so how? :)
[11:44:35] <selwyn> print it out and read it back in without the #2a
[11:46:14] <lotuseater> i now found out about ARRAY-STORAGE-VECTOR but that lacks the dimensional information
[11:47:59] <lotuseater> indeed the reading back in technique works for arrays with numbers
[11:49:56] <ln43> today i was planning to restart a little bit with CL, i installed portacle and now thanks to the selwyn question i was reading this: https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/arrays.html

[12:01:42] <lotuseater> hm yes i think so
[12:04:07] <ln43> but which is that book: the one about cardinal numbers ?
[12:05:05] <lotuseater> no that's way older and very technical
[12:05:14] <ln43> ops
[12:05:34] <ln43> yes i argue from the title ... never read that one
[12:05:37] <lotuseater> the new one is in German, the translation of the title would be "Pi and the Primes"
[12:05:58] <ln43> it's only for mathematicians i suppose
[12:06:08] <lotuseater> afaik this cardinal number stuff was originating from his PhD thesis
[12:06:25] <ln43> yes i suppose, something in number theory maybe

[12:07:17] <lotuseater> or maybe algebraic number theory, so not for me
[12:07:51] <ln43> ok not for me too
[12:08:13] <ln43> maybe only for few percentage (<1%) of the audience
[12:08:24] <lotuseater> more such topics like from Knuth's "Concrete Mathematics"
[12:09:04] <lotuseater> Edi had some funny christmas lectures the last years for a broader audience like "why the earth is not a donut"
[12:09:32] <ln43> why it's not a donut ?
[12:10:29] <lotuseater> yes
[12:10:48] <lotuseater> a good catch phrase to then talk about the poincare conjecture
[12:11:08] <ln43> ok but that is very old conjecture
[12:12:23] <lotuseater> and?
[12:12:35] <lotuseater> hm it was not so old at all
[12:13:33] <ln43> nothing, looking on wikipedia it was conjectured in the 1904 and proved only in the 2006
[12:14:09] <ln43> look at perelman, long hairs and beard
[12:14:16] <ln43> i like his style
[12:14:30] <lotuseater> he is very capable
[12:14:35] <lotuseater> "only"
[12:14:53] <ln43> now maybe he's a bit older... but russians are good at mathematic mostly
[12:14:57] <ln43> they win a lot
[12:15:02] <lotuseater> the prime number theorem took also 100 years for being proved
[12:15:03] <ln43> like polish people ...
[12:15:07] <ln43> i don't know why
[12:15:26] <ln43> maybe math is explained better there
[12:15:34] <lotuseater> they have patience, work hard and see things different than most others
[12:15:36] <ln43> who knows ...
[12:16:38] <ln43> i think that in places where the consumerism is not so dominant people have time to do a lot more
[12:17:06] <ln43> being less distracted from the outside truing to follow dominant brainless models
[12:17:18] <ln43> that is the main reason i suppose ...
[12:17:54] <ln43> so basically there is no hope to improve if not changing the model that wants people only acting as consumers
[12:18:16] <ln43> with no ability to critical thinking and so on
[12:19:59] <ln43> and mathematics has a lot of connections with the transcendence 
[12:21:18] <ln43> so math it's a spiritual discipline mostly at the beginning since it handles concepts that are not immediately applicable to other disciplines
[12:23:06] <ln43> so yes, i think that math is the queen of all the other sciences and technologies 
[12:23:28] <ln43> more important that all the others like a queen in a chess game
[12:23:40] <ln43> or not ?
[12:24:36] <lotuseater> yes
[12:25:11] <ln43> basically i can't measure a number if not supposing that it has the same importance of other physical objects when doing a measurement 
[12:25:31] <ln43> a number has not physical representation... it's intangible 
[12:25:36] <ln43> so it's spiritual 
[12:26:53] <ln43> with physical i mean it has no body ... it's not a corpuscle or a wave or anything else

[12:49:54] <selwyn> hi shka
[12:50:00] <selwyn> today is a day to use python
[12:50:33] <shka> oh god
[12:50:44] <shka> day to use python is a bad day
[12:53:10] <ln43> how do you do to plot a bar cart in CL ?
[12:53:44] <ln43> ... using gnuplot or something similar
[12:53:53] <ln43> ok, just to know
[12:54:03] <ln43> which is the preferable way
[12:54:14] <shka> selwyn: and you could extend vellum-plots instead :P
[12:54:58] <ln43> i never seen vellum-plot ... 
[12:55:15] <selwyn> happily the part of my day where i use python
[12:55:17] <selwyn> is already ending
[12:55:28] <ln43> but i suppose maybe it acts like an interface to some external plotting system
[12:55:31] <ln43> or not ?
[12:56:03] <selwyn> ln43: you can use eazy-gnuplot to plot things with gnuplot
[12:56:12] <selwyn> although it is a good effort, i am starting to go off it

[12:57:30] <selwyn> despite its shortcomings, you give up some of gnuplot's advantages if you just pipe stuff to it
[13:00:00] <selwyn> answer: a reasonable bar chart should not have more bars than pixels
[13:00:04] <selwyn> so i guess like 100
[13:01:35] <ln43> selwin: to answer your question (reading that cl-cookbook) maybe would be fine use maatlisp ... under arrays from tensors (m:copy (m:ones '(2 3)) 'cons)

[19:16:43] <gilberth> Good morning #lispcafe!
[19:22:14] <ck_> hello
[19:26:00] <gilberth> I wonder how I could get a good estimate for the size of a pixmap cache, where I cache ready to blitter CLIM designs, images for the most part.
[19:27:06] *** Quits: kevingal (~quassel@2a02:8084:4140:f300:111d:10d9:6ad:31c9) (Remote host closed the connection)
[19:28:36] <gilberth> Ideally the OS would do that for me, as I could always recreate those pixmaps. Thus if pressure on memory increases, those pixmaps could be evicted.
[19:28:56] *** Joins: razzy (~razzy@user/razzy)
[19:30:24] <gilberth> Ironically PostScript has that. The same mechanism in Cocoa however does not cache at all. Neither does iOS for that matter. And X11 has nothing like that.
[19:31:24] *** Joins: pjb (~pjb@user/pjb)
[19:42:14] *** Joins: lotuseater (~user@p200300e7871bf0006cee4099f1cfa667.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)
[19:57:40] <pl> I belive X11 could do that with XDamage but nobody implements that 
[19:59:38] <gilberth> Isn't XDamage for implementing a composing window manager?
[20:01:03] <gilberth> On that note: X11 also has a perfect double buffering extension, which works fine unless you resize a window, which is very slow. My hunch is, that the back buffer is resized to the exact new size. They could have used a hysteresis, as I do with my back buffer.
[20:03:02] <gilberth> pl: Yes, XDamage is for tracking dirty [damaged] regions of drawables. It's not what I need.
[20:04:40] <pl> gilberth: I meant it as Xserver could use it to notify the app only if there was a need to redraw, while double buffering everything 
[20:06:56] <gilberth> What I'd rather need is the following: I want to render a possibly expensive to create design (an image, multiple Porter-Duff operations on multiple other designs, etc.) to a cache for reuse. That would be a pixmap, that when that design is to be rendered again, could be just blittered. So I'd like a pixmap, which the display server might evict and sending me sorta exposure events, when that pixmap is used again with my duty to recreate
[20:08:32] <gilberth> pl: I know for myself, when to redraw what. XDamage is for monitoring windows belonging to other clients for change. For composing window managers and things like VNC, screen recording, etc. No use for me.
[20:08:59] *** Joins: notzmv (~zmv@user/notzmv)
[20:09:36] <pl> Ah, I thought applications could use that to listen to more limited redraw events 
[20:15:55] <gilberth> With PostScript I have so called "forms". Those forms have a redraw procedure and could be used as the ink used to fill or stroke paths. PS could cache that as the contract is, that the redraw procedure always generates the exact same pixels. Cocoa has sth likewise called "patterns" IIRC. But: Cocoa does not cache, although it may. X11 has nothing like that as far as I know.
[20:17:41] <gilberth> Strange fact: What Cocoa calls a "layer" is an off-screen, hopefully on-GPU, pixmap. iOS has the very same API for a "layer", but doesn't keep pixels, but a display list.
[20:18:49] <gilberth> For PDF and SVG, what CLIM calles a pixmap, I implement that as a display list, too. Same concept really as these PS forms.
[20:19:04] <pl> I might have heard things they would explain ios difference 
[20:20:25] <pl> Apparently, plain pixmap composition on ios was a bit verboten because of how slow the first three or so generations of hw were 
[20:20:37] <gilberth> well, I don't really care, as I don't plan to run CLIM on an iPhone. But: Apple is no fun, it has multiple things for pixmaps to chose from with very different performance characteristics. And what is fast with iOS is slow with macOS and vice versa.

[20:22:05] <gilberth> * kept as a display list in iOS.
[20:23:29] <gilberth> *sigh* When I retire, I might craft X12.
