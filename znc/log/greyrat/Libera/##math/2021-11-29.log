[00:20:28] <B11529> i wonder if the game theory crowd has dedicated much thought to what reversing the order of regular versus tiebreak play in a game.
[00:20:59] <B11529> for example, the current chess world championship is 14 classical games (heavily biased to be draws) followed by rapid play tiebreakers.
[00:21:43] <B11529> say we did the following: have them play some best of 5 (then sudden death) rapid play *before* so we know what will happen should they tie the 14 classical games, beforehand.
[00:22:51] <B11529> would this infuse the 14 classical series with a bit more play-to-win energy?

[01:25:04] <bosspotato> no need
[01:25:18] <bosspotato> or well need I suppose but you don't have to think of it that way
[01:25:40] <bosspotato> the point is that cosh(z) = 1 + z^2/2 + z^4/24 + z^6/720 + ... as per wolframalpha
[01:25:41] <[itchyjunk]> i get `sinh(0) . 2 pi i / 6`

[01:32:53] <bosspotato> because every term in the series apart from z^(-1) integrates to 0 and z^(-1) integrates to 2*pi*i
[01:32:59] <[itchyjunk]> int_c 1/z^2 dz (lets pretend c unit circle) then int_0^2pi (1/e^(i2t)) * ie^(it) dt = +1 - 1 = 0 ?

[05:24:30] <laurus> I'm having trouble understanding this expression: https://a.uguu.se/AHPkBmnG.png . I have this: http://mathb.in/67932 but I'm not sure how the union gets to replace the sup there.
[05:25:19] <PlanckWalk> What does {sup u_j > a}  actually mean?
[05:25:40] <PlanckWalk> It looks like a set of truth-values
[05:25:42] <laurus> PlanckWalk: It means the expression on the right-hand side of the equality sign of what I posted at mathb.in
[05:26:21] <PlanckWalk> Wow.  That's ... special ... notation.
[05:26:27] <PlanckWalk> But okay, let's see.
[05:26:37] <laurus> Wait a minute, I may have made a mistake with that
[05:26:48] <laurus> Sorry, I made a mistake
[05:27:37] <laurus> Actually, I was correct
[05:27:54] <greenbagels> why is there an "is an element of A" both to the right and bottom of the union
[05:28:03] <PlanckWalk> And what is A anyway?
[05:28:06] <laurus> greenbagels: You can ignore that for our purposes
[05:28:16] <laurus> \mathacal{A} is a sigma-algebra here
[05:28:42] <laurus> So since each element is in A, the countable union is in A. But, this is not relevant to our purposes here
[05:29:09] <PlanckWalk> Are there any conditions on the u_j functions?
[05:29:11] <laurus> My goal is to take \{x \,; \sup_{j \in \mathbb{N}} u_j(x) > a\}\) and eliminate the sup and "replace it" with the countable union
[05:29:21] <greenbagels> god i hate when people try to replace sentences with symbols
[05:29:31] <laurus> PlanckWalk: Well, the u_j are functions into the extended real numbers
[05:29:36] <laurus> and they are measurable.
[05:29:57] <PlanckWalk> I don't mind replacing sentences with symbols so long as the symbols have well-known meanings.
[05:31:04] <PlanckWalk> Then I don't think that equality holds.

[05:32:39] <laurus> Oh, I'm dumb, it kind of explains this in the next paragraph after that expression
[05:32:52] <laurus> I thought it was something that was supposed to directly follow from these notational manipulations
[05:32:59] <laurus> But it's actually an argument that needs to be made.
[05:33:59] <laurus> The argument is: say x is in the LHS. Then for that x, sup_{j \in N} u_j(x) > a. Say x is not in the RHS, so then there is no j such that u_j(x) > a, i.e. for all j, u_j(x) <= a. But then sup_{j \in N} u_j(x) <= a, a contradiction. Therefore x is in the RHS.

[07:04:43] <B11529> rather than play 14 classical games and then do a rapid tiebreak series if they're tied after the 14, do the tiebreak first so we know who wins in the case of tie beforehand.
[07:05:20] <B11529> the idea is the tiebreak loser will play aggressively the 14 regular ones. will that more than offset the defensive/drawish play of the tiebreak winner?

[07:06:43] <droid3> hey guys i got a question we all know from differential /algebraic topology realms that the classification of 2-dimensional compact surfaces is pretty much solved.
[07:07:22] <isekaijin> B11529: That is not likely to work, because overly aggressive play right from the beginning of the match is not a rational strategy, even if you are guaranteed to lose on tiebreaks.
[07:07:33] <droid3> Basically there Sphere , torus , n-hole torus . And in the case of nonorientable ones there projective plane, spheres with cross caps,...etc
[07:07:55] <droid3> But what i am curious about is there any classification on noncompact 2-dim surfaces?
[07:08:20] <B11529> isekaijin: what would optimal play be for the tiebreak loser?
[07:08:59] <isekaijin> B11529: They would probably only be more aggressive than normal in the last 4 normal games or so.
[07:09:28] <droid3> its the compact criteria that allows one to classify dim 2 surfaces. Because compactness means it will be closed and bounded in R^n
[07:09:29] <B11529> so only two white chances to pull out a lead?
[07:10:13] <B11529> i don't agree this is optimal
[07:10:31] <droid3> So essentially if its not compact then either the surface is not closed or not bounded most likely both.
[07:10:56] <isekaijin> The problem is that, often, one player (usually white) can force the other to choose between a drawish game or a slightly inferior one.

[07:11:42] <droid3> So is there any classification on noncompact dim-2 surfaces. I mean with differential/algebraic topology we all know dim 2 compact surfaces orientatable or nonorientatble are all classified
[07:12:11] <droid3> This is one of the great theorems you learn about in topology course its pretty famous result that most are aware about.
[07:12:26] <isekaijin> Mmm, if I recall correctly, all two-dimensional surfaces are classified, not just the compact ones.
[07:12:35] <droid3> But i was curious not many articles or books talk on the classification or trying to apply it to noncompact surfaces.
[07:12:43] <dude12312414> Lee has a chapter on the compact case
[07:12:55] <cherim> In XX century draws in matches were considered in favor of the current champion, so it was essentially as you suggest
[07:13:57] <cherim> Not that it affected the overall aggressiveness much (compared to the style of the players)
[07:14:15] <droid3> isekaijin i was not aware of the noncompact case ???  Have a link or info on that. Because if the surface is not connected but compact then you just apply the theorem to each connect
[07:14:16] <cherim> But people did suggest this switch of tiebreaks in modern setting as well
[07:14:58] <isekaijin> Mmm... Couldn't you build non-compact surfaces as infinite connected sums of compact ones?
[07:15:35] <droid3> So connected or not the theory generalizes by just focusing on one component at a time. Aka all compact connected dim 2 surfaces are equivalent to some nth hole sphere or in the nonorientable case sphere with n cross caps /projective planes.
[07:15:43] <B11529> cherim: if this turns out to be 14 draws they will need to do something

[07:24:31] <cherim> Stop typing and do the reading
[07:24:53] <droid3> you just get more n-hole or n-cross cap components its trivial for connect to nonconnect surface

[10:18:13] <Batzy> I'm trying to show that Cholesky factorization for solving a system like Ax = b is backward stable. So far I have https://i.imgur.com/A1iTmjZ.png but I am really not sure in the very last inequality how to make it work. That last inequality is only true if ||A|| = ||\tilde{L} \tilde{L}^*|| which looking at it I dont think is true
[10:18:15] <Nistar> rindolf: Thanks. I don't know how to use this though.
[10:18:39] <Batzy> but it's also the only way I can see ||\delta A||/ ||A|| being O(\eps)

[11:07:46] <droid3> essentially the proof that dim 4 is equivalent to the word group problem was shown to be true by exhibiting a manifold associated with each presentation/word group.

[11:16:36] <mycroftiv> droid3: if you would read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_manifolds it would tell you that it does generalize

[11:16:56] <droid3> And just maybe classify by special types of interest at best.
[11:18:38] <droid3> "Manifolds in dimension 4 and above cannot be effectively classified: given two n-manifolds ( n ≥ 4 {\displaystyle n\geq 4} n\geq 4) presented as CW complexes or handlebodies, there is no algorithm for determining if they are isomorphic (homeomorphic, diffeomorphic). This is due to the unsolvability of the word problem for groups, or more precisely, the triviality problem (given a finite presentation for a group, is it the trivia
[11:18:38] <droid3> l group?). Any finite presentation of a group can be realized as a 2-complex, and can be realized as the 2-skeleton of a 4-manifold (or higher). Thus one cannot even compute the fundamental group of a given high-dimensional manifold, much less a classification. "
[11:19:20] <droid3> Ok ya all set up so it does generalize so essentially 0,1,2,3 dimensions is all we can hope for in a general classification
[11:20:14] <droid3> Ok still going thru the 2 dim noncompact proof and the classification of 3 manifold proofs there quite challenging and will take some time to get down.

[15:18:13] <Z-module> cadmio, you got pretty close yesterday (or day before, I forget). It's about looking at G's elements as permutations, and considering even vs. odd permutations.
[15:19:27] <Z-module> you'll also need to consider the existence of an element of G having odd order > 1  (the m part gives you this)
[15:21:01] <cadmio> this what I've atm: there's an element t with order 2 by Cauchy's theorem. This t can be expressed as a product of m disjoint transpositions, since m is odd t is an odd permutation

[22:42:46] <dfdx> Hi everyone. I am reading through Joseph Gallan's Contemporary Abstract Algebra and i'm stuck on a proof for the "Division Algorithm" for integers -- i.e., let a and b be integers with b > 0, then there exist unique integers q and r with the property that a = bq + r, where 0 <= r < b. I can follow the proof about finding q and r, but i struggle with proving their uniqueness. Gallan supposes q, q', r, and r',
[22:42:47] <Guest78> oh I see it now, pollion
[22:42:52] <dfdx> with r <= r' for convenience. Then he says: bq + r = bq' + r', and b(q-q') = r' - r. So, b divides r' - r and 0 <= r' - r <= r' < b. It follows that r' - r = 0.  But how??
[22:43:30] <B11529> what else can it be if b divides it?
[22:43:55] <B11529> iow, r'-r is simultaneously a multiple of b and less than b.
[22:44:06] *** Joins: texasmusicinstru (~Rheanna@218.78.67.149)
[22:44:09] <B11529> only one number satisfies those two conditions
[22:44:13] <dfdx> I guess I don't know the implication of what b dividing something means. All I know is the definition, that if b divides r' - r, then there exists some t  such that r' - r = bt.
[22:44:33] <B11529> "b divides x" is the same as "x is a mutiple of b"
[22:45:02] <dfdx> right, b(q - q') = r' - r.
[22:45:18] <Guest78> riv Pollion is the radical of I = <x^2, y^2> going to be: sqrt(I) = <x,y> ?
[22:45:28] <B11529> b(q-q')=r'-r means that b divides (r'-r)
[22:45:33] <dfdx> okay, so what?
[22:45:39] <Pollion> Guest78: again, it depends on your base ring
[22:45:44] <B11529> so r'-r is a multiple of b
[22:45:52] <Guest78> why?

[23:00:18] *** Quits: mei (~mei@user/mei) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:00:27] <B11529> and kb < b ⇒ k < 1
[23:00:49] <B11529> so k is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1. how many choices are there?

[23:01:13] *** Joins: Mattiaslndstrm (~Mattiasln@c213-103-137-235.bredband.tele2.se)
[23:03:08] <dfdx> so if k = 1, then go back to b|(r' - r), which implies that bt = (r' - r), but t = 0, so 0 = (r' - r). and that's how you get to r' = r.

[23:07:30] <riv> btw
[23:07:32] <riv> since you proved q = q'

[23:08:32] <riv> bq + r = a = bq' + r',   rewrite q' = q and subtract off both sides to get r = r'
[23:09:34] <dfdx> riv: well, we have to be careful because you implicitly assume that q - q' must be positive, no?
[23:09:39] <dfdx> or at least non-negative.
[23:09:54] <riv> no, q - q' =  0
[23:10:06] <dfdx> but prior to that.

[23:10:43] <dfdx> suppose (1) 0 <= r' - r < b and (2) b(q - q') = r' - r.   Then  0 <= b(q - q') < b.   Right?

[23:12:52] <Guest78> Pollion also, do you know an example of the "Ideal-Variety Correspondence" theorem?

[23:29:13] <Z-module>  (...)  is quite common notation for an ideal, but sure, <...> is used also
[23:29:33] <Z-module> in fact, for the zero ideal, the most common notation is simply 0

[23:30:06] <XCode> Guest78: yes maybe
