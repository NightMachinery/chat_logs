[01:53:45] <Joanna> Hi everyone what’s new ?
[01:56:57] <jan6> google's more evil that we knew, but no more than we assumed, and nothing else is new ;P
[01:57:29] <Joanna> Hi jan6 what did they do this time ?
[01:57:38] <jan6> everything
[01:57:43] <jan6> 19:40 <lts> "When did [Google's] motto become 'Be super evil'?" https://twitter.com/fasterthanlime/status/1452053938195341314
[01:58:00] <Joanna> Ty I’ll look
[01:58:19] <jan6> and from another channel someone linked another related thread, 22:44 <bwinton> Related thread: https://twitter.com/jason_kint/status/1451579045246820355
[02:04:57] <Joanna> Someone I know in Australia told me that when he was doing his PhD thesis people working for Google and other tech companies showed up at the university and the university demanded that he share his source code with them. When he refused he was kicked out of the PhD program.
[02:05:33] <Joanna> So they control the universities..
[02:06:46] <Hydragyrum> bruh
[02:08:50] <Joanna> There is something a lot more mundane though and that is the people who control the internet search engines control what we find and that’s quite a lot of control. Unless you have the wherewithal to create your own search engine.
[02:09:42] <jan6> there are a handful of alternate search engines, with their own crawlers
[02:10:13] <jan6> although I wouldn't expect people to be aware of stuff like Mojeek, lol
[02:10:25] <jan6> https://www.mojeek.com/
[02:10:42] <jan6> not sure of the result quality, but that's the first one which does their own crawling, that comes to mind
[02:12:12] <jan6> and Searx would probably work *IF* the big providers don't collaborate with their manipulation, since it's a metasearch engine with tons of potential sources, and you can set the "bias" for how high to rank each one's results compared to others
[02:12:24] <Joanna> Never heard of that one . I’ll give it a try but still we don’t really know who owns it or what their intentions are
[02:12:24] <jan6> normies still use google tho
[02:12:57] <Joanna> Google has made some excellent products which they provide for “free”
[02:13:38] <jan6> youtube was cool, until the pandemic made the algorithm go haywire and short-circuit into being awfully boring and uninteresting
[02:15:47] <Joanna> The search is a bit different results no spam advert links that’s good.
[02:16:58] <Joanna> However large tech companies are good at buying out competitors
[02:17:16] <jan6> it's underground enough to be unknown, lol
[02:17:53] <Joanna> I don’t really trust anything anymore. Maybe if it’s very obscure it won’t be attacked as long as hardly anyone uses it.
[02:20:35] <Joanna> Most people just follow the crowd no matter what the situation is.
[02:20:41] <jan6> yep
[02:21:02] <Joanna> Sometimes it’s good to follow the crowd sometimes not..
[02:21:16] <jan6> most people still use google, to, well, "google stuff", and if they bother to change DNS, they'll change to google's 8.8.8.8
[02:21:37] <jan6> google is pretty good at protecting you from everyone who isn't google
[02:21:58] <Joanna> I really don’t like the garbage google puts as top search results
[02:22:45] <Joanna> If you search for an opposing view something controversial on google you will get the exact opposite of what you searched for.
[02:23:06] <jan6> well, blame SEO experts becoming an actual job, for one
[02:23:23] <jan6> but yeah google is known for manipulating political searches
[02:24:09] <Joanna> Wikipedia has become useless for anything related to hot issues. Wikipedia even bashes Weston price
[02:25:39] <Joanna> It’s all just propaganda now. Unless you are looking up articles about plants or something
[02:29:27] <jan6> lol, over time the vandalized pages seem to be mostly fixed, but you cannot do anything to prevent motivated people from creating biased pages, even if you lock it to registred account, or "longer than X time" someone will have access, and either want to do it, or be hired to do it
[02:29:58] <jan6> it's just a tug of war, where the other side won't give up
[02:39:54] <Joanna> I’m not sure how the pages are controlled ultimately. Don’t very few people have editing rights now?
[03:03:43] <jan6> idk, it depends on page, probably
[03:05:00] <jan6> iirc, there are tiers of restrictions they apply to pages that are getting hit with constant rulebreaking edits (such as not being objective, or sourcing themselves, or whatnot)
[03:05:52] <jan6> I highly doubt the entire site is limited, though

[04:19:09] <Roey> there is one scene that i do like from Dr. Who, however.
[04:20:04] <Roey> it's when the Dr. and his gimp bring Vincent Van Gogh from the past and stick him into our timeline, taking him to the Louvre to see his own shit in the future

[17:19:34] *** Quits: Atque (~Atque@user/atque) (Quit: ...)
[17:20:51] <elkclone> ah morning I am aware this is not the right chan but do any of you know if there is a trading/forex/btc/usd type chan
[17:20:52] <elkclone> ?
[17:22:03] <elkclone> I have just launched metatrader 5. and haven't used it since I wrote a python script for backtesting forex like 2 years ago so I almost forget how to use the platform. need some refresher help. lol
[17:23:17] <Joanna> elkclone: I was just listening to a podcast discussing that very topic of all things..
[17:23:33] *** Joins: Atque (~Atque@user/atque)
[17:25:15] <Joanna> I have no idea of how all that stuff works though maybe try searching channels by keyword
[17:25:26] <elkclone> cool, yeah I want to 'dabble' in trading again. I am very careful to use only small amounts for fun and study but it's nice to earn a few bucks as well. so I have a trade account and access to a couple trad stocks but I may be able to get into a bit of other stuff. crypto and forex appeal to me as my work hours suck for monitoring traditional nasdaq trades. 
[17:26:12] <elkclone> cool thanks I'll search around. 
[17:26:34] <Joanna> I monitor currency prices that’s about it
[17:27:39] <Joanna> Using ofx
[17:31:18] <elkclone> cool I found #trading that will have to do for now. I could actually rtfm today lol. assuming work doesn't call. I may be home due to a late cancel last night. 
[17:31:50] <elkclone> good ole alis. 
[17:32:24] <elkclone> also the stock I should have bought yesterday ie set up the buy for market open has just shot up. omfg. 
[17:32:47] <Joanna> I heard a rumor that they want to start taxing people whose stocks go up in value even if they aren’t selling them
[17:32:53] <elkclone> watching a couple semi conductor stocks
[17:33:25] <elkclone> Joanna, I can trade within a tfsa account. 'tax free savings account'

[17:34:51] <Joanna> They have all sorts of bad ideas in the works such as monitoring every transaction on every account
[17:35:10] <elkclone> basically I need the 2 stocks I want to trade sideways while I build up the courage to fund my little trade account. hehe. 
[17:36:01] <Joanna> One of my relatives used to be good at making money off stocks. I feel like it’s gambling..
[17:36:16] <Joanna> I have no idea of what will go up.
[17:36:48] <Joanna> Sometimes stocks just disappear
[17:37:04] <elkclone> ah yeah, my trade account is linked directly to my tax info. as in they have my balls so anything I do in this account is known and taxed if needed as I go. the tsfa account is the only way to avoid that. I have 3 accounts with same provider. personal (taxed), crypto (taxed), and tsfa (tax free:D)
[17:37:33] <Joanna> I’ve never heard of that type of account
[17:38:00] <Joanna> Except I think for tax free municipal bonds or something
[17:38:05] <elkclone> mmm
[17:38:26] <elkclone> yeah I am sure you have something similar just a matter of figuring out what they call it. 
[17:39:17] <elkclone> they limit the amount I can put in the account each year. but that limit is way above my level. 
[17:39:22] <jan6> oh noice JimBuntu's here
[17:39:41] <Joanna> They give tax breaks to billionaires. Like if sprawlmart wants to build a new store cities will bend over backwards to give incentives
[17:39:53] <Joanna> jan6: you know jimbuntu?
[17:40:31] <jan6> not exactly "know", but he's in my channel, and we chat sometimes
[17:40:51] <Joanna> Oh I didn’t know you had a channel..
[17:41:16] <jan6> ##jan6 for all the friends of jan6 and people wanting to talk with jan6 ;P
[17:41:24] <Joanna> I met him in Linux off topic back on freenode
[17:41:31] <jan6> prolly same place
[17:41:39] <Joanna> That sounds very familiar for some reason

[17:47:48] <JimBuntu> Nothing much really over here, same ol same ol this week.  How about you?
[17:48:25] <Joanna> Struggling with gui after updating ide is all
[17:48:56] <JimBuntu> UI breaking/altering updates are always nice :(
[17:49:45] <Joanna> I had regrets about updating. Some of the new features are nice but things acted strange and had to be tweaked
[17:51:15] <Joanna> I finally compromised by pasting some old files into the folder of new ide because whatever changes they made had made things worse as in not accepting keydown events
[17:52:58] <Joanna> I’d much rather override their code but the default behavior was horrible I think it’s some complicated problem of making it cross platform. It has a lot of conditional compile directives in it.
[17:55:03] <Joanna> I think it’s always good to keep a copy of current application before updating something but a lot of platforms don’t let you revert of you don’t like the changes. I don’t think..

[18:00:50] <spanishsunrise> Watching a political show on YouTube.Yes I'm in spain
[18:01:29] <spanishsunrise> I migrated here because of the climate here.
[18:01:48] <Joanna> I like warm weather too.
[18:02:02] <spanishsunrise> Most do. Hehehe
[18:02:20] <Joanna> I miss YouTube before it had advertisements
[18:02:59] <jan6> yuk, warm

[18:06:38] <Joanna> I like swimming in water with fish
[18:07:12] <Joanna> Is the water always warm?
[18:08:12] <Joanna> Because swimming can happen but not be fun for some people who want to train no matter what :)
[18:09:15] <Joanna> Also water full of seaweed or jellyfish is not fun
[18:09:47] <spanishsunrise> its not at the warmest in autumn
[18:10:02] <spanishsunrise> but its not freezing
[18:10:14] <Joanna> What is the water temperature?
[18:10:51] <spanishsunrise> cold. I couldn't say exactly. cold but not freezing
[18:10:56] <Joanna> For me to want to swim the sun needs to be warm enough to dry off
[18:11:26] <spanishsunrise> well its like that for sure
[18:11:52] <spanishsunrise> just the air will dry you
