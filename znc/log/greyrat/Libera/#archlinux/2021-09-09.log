[02:07:30] <mpan> conr: more or less, but you don’t want to `makepkg` without first checking the PKGBUILD. Also, after getting accustomed to AUR, consider stuff like aurutils to automate your workflow.
[02:07:31] <conr> but i was told "not" to use an aur helper ;)
[02:07:39] <NetSysFire> no, Namarrgon is a fish
[02:07:49] <mpan> Do not use AUR helper until you are fluent in using AUR the manual way.

[02:13:55] <demize> Namarrgon: You should lodge an official complaint.
[02:13:59] <kevr> there are cleaner ways to do it, but that's the idea.
[02:14:24] <kevr> Then, in virt-manager, you just edit your vm and set its nic to your bridge.
[02:15:12] <maztheman> ok bridge networking will allow my vm to get my main lan ip ?
[02:15:18] <thurstylark> that's no different than how the libvirt wiki page says to do it, why go out of your way to be confusing with different instructions -_-
[02:15:52] <thurstylark> maztheman: bridge is one way to do it. Whether it's the *best* way depends on what you need that network link to do for youw

[02:17:25] <maztheman> that way i can xfer large files without going over network
[02:18:08] <thurstylark> don't have to set anything up beforehand, just set your vm's network to be macvtap associated with the correct interface, and your vm will show up on its own MAC on the network

[05:40:33] <rcf> rabbitnightmare: the AUR is nothing but a collection of git repositories which contain the instructions for building the package (in the form of the PKGBUILD) 
[05:40:47] <rabbitnightmare> ok so in Ubuntu or Linux Mint I could simply add a repository and use the packagemanager to install them
[05:40:54] <rabbitnightmare> I know its not Ubuntu
[05:40:56] <sheep> you can't do that on Arch
[05:40:56] *** Quits: semeion (~semeion@user/semeion) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[05:41:17] <sheep> on Arch you need to download the package sources from the AUR with git then build them with makepkg -si
[05:41:30] <rabbitnightmare> aha
[05:41:31] <rcf> Well, you can use third-party pacman repos if you really want 
[05:41:44] <rabbitnightmare> rcf, whatever is the supported way
[05:41:53] <rcf> The AUR is more supported. 
[05:41:58] <rabbitnightmare> building from source seems arbitrary
[05:41:59] <tleydxdy[m]> both are not supported
[05:42:26] <rcf> Though keep in mind that literally anyone can upload to the AUR so package quality may be questionable. 
[05:42:29] <sheep> the point is that you can customize the contents of AUR packages
[05:42:44] <rabbitnightmare> ah
[05:42:48] <rabbitnightmare> I dont need that
[05:43:05] <rabbitnightmare> good lord I missed mate
[05:43:15] <rabbitnightmare> gnome 2 is so comfy
[05:43:39] <rcf> Also HBO might still block you in chrome, I think they demand a level of DRM that doesn't exist on Linux 
[05:43:51] <sheep> well, anyway, it's 3 commands for a package with no deps: git clone <url>; cd <folder>; makepkg -si
[05:43:53] <thrice> what does "comfy" mean resp. a DE
[05:43:59] <rcf> Familiar. 
[05:44:07] <rabbitnightmare> rcf, disney and hulu works in chrome last I checked
[05:44:27] <rabbitnightmare> as does amazon prime video
[05:44:32] <rcf> HBO decided to go further and attracted some controversy as a result 
[05:44:38] <rabbitnightmare> interesting
[05:44:49] <rcf> Maybe they backpedaled, I do not know for sure. 
[05:44:54] <rabbitnightmare> right
[05:45:07] <rabbitnightmare> I figured I would install chrome for all my google stuff, bank stuff etc and see if it worked
[05:45:22] <rcf> Chrome is more useful these days if you need sync support

[06:29:07] <ascor> Hi. Recompiling Linux-Hardened-5.13 with Ryzen support according to this (https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Ryzen#Kernel) causes my lightdm/Xorg to fail when booting. /var/log/Xorg.0.log gives me "NVIDIA(0): Failed to allocate shared surface" and "AddScreen/ScreenInit failed for driver 0".

[14:25:15] <miix000> So I've got a bluetooth keyboard that disconnects after idling for 10 minutes. After a quick press, It reconnects, but the xmodmap settings are back to default
[14:25:42] <miix000> I've got Caps mapped to ctrl and now I need to run xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap everytime after a reconnection

[14:30:59] <ds-ac> I think that your device is detected as new keyboard each time it reconnects. I think that you can generate an X keymap from your Xmodmap configuration and configure XOrg to use this layout.
[14:31:15] <d55> miix000: udev rules should fit fine I guess.
[14:31:39] <ds-ac> This way, any freshly-connected keyboard would have the right layout
[14:33:42] <miix000> Thanks, I'll check out both options and see if I can make it work.

[14:39:33] <Foxboron> and yes, but locate isn't going to cross device boundaries by default IIRC
[14:39:42] <kuhilas> `locate mlocate.db` finds only /usr/share/man/man5/mlocate.db.5.gz  but when I run for example `locate -d /usr/share/man/man5/mlocate.db.5.gz mlocate.db` it says `locate: `/usr/share/man/man5/mlocate.db.5.gz' does not seem to be a mlocate database`
[14:40:24] <kuhilas> https://manpages.debian.org/stretch/mlocate/mlocate.db.5.en.html this implies that the database file is called mlocate.db though
[14:40:25] <phrik> Title: mlocate.db(5) — mlocate — Debian stretch — Debian Manpages (at manpages.debian.org)
[14:40:26] <Foxboron> You are mixing up the parameters to the flag

[20:36:07] <DF32> Hey. I'm having a problem downloading xorg (and other packages, like firefox). When I do "pacman -S xorg" it starts downloading and then it starts to give me errors for all files "Error: <file>: doenst have required signature. The file /var/cahce/pacman/<file> is corrupted. Do you wish to delete?". I already tried to do this:
[20:36:07] <DF32> https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman#.22Failed_to_commit_transaction_.28invalid_or_corrupted_package.29.22_error  but it didn't work
[20:36:09] <phrik> Title: pacman - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
[20:36:49] <DF32> Someone knows why this is happening? Also tried refresh keys
[20:36:53] <mpan> Have you tried a different mirror?
[20:37:16] <DF32> I have a bunch of mirrors uncommented (default)

[20:38:00] <mpan> That’s not my question. pacman will download only from one mirror, not matter how many of them you uncomment — unless it can’t use that mirror.
[20:38:36] <Namarrgon> you probably don't want to install the whole "xorg" group, it's full of crap you'll never need

[20:40:47] <DF32> @mpan Yes, thats why I'm saying that I have a bunch of them uncommented. With so many of them, one of them should be ok O.o. But will try that
[20:41:19] <DF32> @Namarrgon I'm just installing cause I'm having problems starting x
[20:41:20] <mpan> DF32: no, read again. Only one mirror is being used.
[20:41:45] <DF32> @Namarrgon thik its because I don't have the twm and xterm installed
[20:41:56] <mpan> Also, by prepending ‘@’ before my name you are making us not notice your messages. This is not Twitter.

[21:54:07] <thebombzen_> https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_Build_System article describes the arch build system. You can use it to build source packages to target packages. those source packages have a PKGBUILD which is a bash script.

Is there a easy way to redo the install (and run every hooks) without manually copying/pasting the package from pacman log ?
