[00:19:04] <t4nk_freenode> Hi, my name is t4nk_freenode, and I have a problem
[00:19:23] <t4nk_freenode> *waiting for the entire channel to say: 'Hi t4nk_freenode'
[00:19:28] <t4nk_freenode> *
[00:19:52] <t4nk_freenode> I just now counted 8 ff windows with tabs
[00:19:55] <t4nk_freenode> ...
[00:19:59] <ede> welcome to the Anonymous Firefox Users, t4nk_freenode
[00:20:12] <t4nk_freenode> ;)
[00:21:11] <t4nk_freenode> probably some 500 tabs in the 'main window' alone
[00:22:02] <ede> how do you people even handle this?
[00:22:28] *** Joins: mz` (~mz`@user/mz/x-8532539)
[00:22:34] <t4nk_freenode> got 32G of ram, that helps a great deal
[00:22:46] <t4nk_freenode>  5.3 GiB + 278.5 MiB =   5.6 GiB       firefox (11)
[00:23:08] <t4nk_freenode> this isn't even after running all too long
[00:23:21] <t4nk_freenode> normally it would probably read 11G
[00:24:20] <ede> 32G is nice indeed
[00:24:40] <ede> nearly half as what my system disk holds :?P
[00:25:54] *** Quits: mz` (~mz`@user/mz/x-8532539) (Max SendQ exceeded)
[00:26:06] <t4nk_freenode> 32G used to only be for fancy web servers
[00:26:32] <t4nk_freenode> now it's normal
[00:30:28] <ede> not even now
[00:32:22] <ede> https://10toptest.de/vergleich/beste-gaming-pcs/
[00:32:29] <ede> 16-32GB and that'sa gaming pc top 10
[00:32:55] <t4nk_freenode> sad thing is that if I would compile a package like  ff, qtwebengine, spidermonkey right now... my system would OOM and crash
[00:33:53] <ede> more swap maybe?
[00:34:11] <t4nk_freenode> I have none!
[00:34:23] <t4nk_freenode> I'm so glad for that
[00:34:50] <ede> faster indeed, but if you run out of ram, oom.
[00:35:27] <t4nk_freenode> in my experience.. if you have it enabled, then it will be used at some point, even when you have enough mem available
[00:36:44] <t4nk_freenode>  though you could swapoff of course
[00:37:28] *** Joins: mz` (~mz`@user/mz/x-8532539)
[00:37:54] <ede> i'd just use it when you really need it
[00:38:08] <ede> firefox runs fine w/o? no. you have to build? yes.
[00:39:16] <t4nk_freenode> would be kind of nice to patch the oomkiller to try and make a swap file first... yeah, that's a nifty idea you got there

[00:44:58] <Zelouille> t4nk_freenode: You can configure how/when your swap is used with "vm.swappiness" and "vfs_cache_pressure".
[00:45:28] <t4nk_freenode> I'll have a look-see, thnx
[00:45:59] <ede> isn't there swapd already, maybe even oomd?
[00:47:29] <Zelouille> My notes are old. It may be different nowadays. :)
[00:50:11] <Zelouille> You can also use zram to compress ram into some sort of intermediary swap.
[00:55:57] <ede> *nod* it was suggested to me a few times already, i'll look for it after the sysupgrade, whenever it may happen.

[11:41:56] <Cork> dob1: your prob hitting https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1305288
[11:42:40] <dob1> Cork, a 5 years old bug, wow
[11:42:42] <Cork> dob1: best option might be to just get the coffeine extensions for gnomeshell (if that is what your using) and disable the screen savor that way
[11:42:57] <dob1> I am not using gnome
[11:43:24] <Cork> well you just said "ubuntu" so had to go with the default de
[11:43:37] <dob1> I am using i3
[11:44:21] <dob1> the weird thing (but I am not sure at 100%) is that I noticed the problem once firefox switched to snap on ubuntu
[11:44:34] <Cork> well then you will have to check with them and see if there is a way to trigger the screensaver dbus disable calls
[11:44:44] <dob1> I was at most sure that this problem was not there when it was using the deb version
[11:44:55] <Cork> might very well be
[11:45:06] <Cork> snaps runs basically a vm with the application in it
[11:45:56] <dob1> if it's this, and I hope no, does the people test before releasing ?
[11:46:19] <Cork> you would have to ask ubuntu, none at mozilla is involved with snapd
[11:46:56] <Cork> and as far as i know alsmost only canonical uses snapd
[11:47:01] <dob1> from what I read this is not right. the switch was done to make firefox team works directly on firefox on ubuntu
[11:47:10] <Cork> most other uses flatpack
[11:47:45] <Cork> dob1: that was the switch away from feavily patched firefox releases
[11:47:58] <Cork> not to a isolated vm release
[11:48:10] <Cork> that is a canonical desision
[11:48:33] <Cork> they do the same with all browsers as far as i know
[11:48:33] <dob1> can you read here ? https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2021/09/ubuntu-makes-firefox-snap-default
[11:49:06] <Cork> doesn't really matter, the ubuntu releases of firefox is from ubuntu not mozilla
[11:49:30] <Cork> and historically ubuntu has had a ton of problems with there releases of firefox
[11:49:57] <dob1> https://linux.slashdot.org/story/21/10/14/2013235/canonical-releases-ubuntu-linux-2110-impish-indri    " The new Firefox snap, published by Mozilla, improves security and guarantees access to both the latest and the extended support release versions of the browser."
[11:50:15] <Cork> have fixed about 1 to 3 problems a week by moving ppl from ubuntu releases of firefox to mozilla releases

[11:51:22] <Cork> huh apparently mozilla has snaps now days http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/95.0/snap/
[11:51:28] <dob1> Cork, sorry I don't want to argue with you but imho, from what I read, it's not like you say
[11:51:29] <Cork> well the comment still stands
[11:51:42] <Cork> snaps is isolated so things will not always work
[11:53:25] <dob1> it's not a reason what you say to an user that is watching a video and the dpms switch off the monitor? that snap is isolated?  he will say "what is snap and who care"
[11:54:07] <dob1> it's not a uncommon task to watch a video
[11:54:13] *** Quits: mz` (~mz`@user/mz/x-8532539) (Max SendQ exceeded)
[11:55:04] <Cork> sure, but if the program can't tell the system it wants to disable it well the system will run as if it doesn't want to disable it
[11:55:22] <Cork> that is the point of isolatio
[11:55:24] <Cork> +n
[11:56:10] <dob1> canonical and mozilla, firefox agreed to this switch... it's like 15 years (?) that mozilla is creating a nice browser (I use it everyday) and they didn't thing/test this??? it's impossible

[11:57:31] <Cork> i have no idea what they thought, i just state what problems happen from time to time when you make a separate copy of every lib in the system (except the kernel and glibc as those can't be separated) and put them in a vm
[11:57:51] <Cork> the communication protocols will differ, the connections will fails things happen
[11:58:03] <dob1> I am very disappointed
[11:58:15] <dob1> not that this is important, I am nobody
[11:58:21] <Cork> go complain to the snap ppl, not much we can do
[11:58:42] <Cork> if you didn't read the topic, this is the community channel, not mozilla
[11:59:17] <dob1> yes, as I said I am not arguing with you, just discussing. don't take me wrong, nothing against you
[12:00:13] <Cork> i find snaps to be a stupid ide. It makes life easier for the developer "isolate the dependency so we don't have to think about it". What they don't think about is that it means that the user will have to do that instead
[12:01:10] <Cork> "does this snap have a voulnerable lib that i need to make sure gets updated even if it is fixed in my system", "does this snap use a lib not compatible withe the protocol the rest of my system libs use"
[12:01:58] <Cork> usually that is the job of the package manager, but not with snaps
[12:02:07] <dob1> to be honest I find a suitable idea for some type of software, like ide (eclipse, idea, whatever) that has many components and requires a lot of dependencies
[12:02:32] <Cork> only if you don't care if all your dependencies gets fixed
[12:02:33] <dob1> but for a browser is the worst user case scenario, first for the startup time, second for problems like the ones I wrote
[12:03:16] <Cork> snaps and the like is basically just a clonky way to doing static binaries
[12:03:44] <dob1> and to be honest, if the motivation is "you have the update as soon as they are released" well, I don't care, I can wait a week too... and security fixex are always fixed asap
[12:03:48] <Cork> they have the exact same problem when you get voulnerabilities or incompatibilities in these dependencies
[12:04:22] <Cork> every single program needs to be updated separately, or you have problems
[12:04:50] <dob1> Cork, my firefox dir in ~/snap is 1.8gb....  you think this is a normal?  they have to rethink this
[12:04:53] <dob1> it's crazy
[12:06:06] <Cork> 1.8g sounds reasonable for minimalisitc os release ya
[12:06:24] <Cork> about 100mb for firefox the rest for a full /lib /lib64 copy

[12:09:10] <xx> Cork: so don't use snap then
[12:09:28] <dob1> you don't choose to use it
[12:09:37] <xx> but you can choose to not use it
[12:09:41] <Cork> xx: snaps definitely has it uses, but "all programs should be snaps" as many mantras, i find to be extreamly false
[12:09:46] *** Quits: mz` (~mz`@user/mz/x-8532539) (Max SendQ exceeded)
[12:10:20] <Cork> well snaps or any of the other isolation solutions
[12:10:36] <xx> also, the firefox snap is maintained by mozilla officially
[12:10:50] <Cork> ya i found that a little while back
[12:10:52] <dob1> xx, no really true, on next ubuntu release for example firefox will be only available on snap as they say. so you have 2 choices: use snap, update it manually
[12:11:16] <xx> dob1: "update it manually" = install it once, and then it updates automatically
[12:11:52] <Cork> well you have to have it extracted in the home folder for that to work, but ya
[12:12:05] <dob1> xx, ok so why the distributions doesn't go for this ?  there has to be some problems for sure
[12:12:20] <xx> dob1: because distros suffer from NIH syndrome and have to do their own thing
[12:12:31] <Cork> dob1: cause users noramlly don't have write permissions to programs
[12:12:47] <Cork> cause that has the risk of infection modifying them
[12:12:52] <xx> Cork: even on ubuntu, ~/bin and is added to $PATH automatically
[12:13:00] <xx> ~/.local/bin too
[12:13:03] <Cork> sure
[12:13:24] <Cork> but that is why distros doesn't use the updater from mozilla
[12:14:01] <Cork> it is installed in /usr/lib and /usr/bin not ~/lib and ~/bin
[12:14:06] <xx> yeah right, worry about ~/bin being modified by infection, and ignore that ~/.profile and other RC files can also be modified anyway to cause even worse problems
[12:14:30] <Cork> it isn't just that
[12:15:03] <Cork> 1. programs installed in the users owned folders can be affected by running programs as they have write permission
[12:15:03] <dob1> these are some system related problems, where to put binaries etc, but really the problem I reported is something that I can't believe mozilla doesn't consider
[12:15:07] *** Joins: john_johnk (~Thunderbi@112.54.140.77.rev.sfr.net)
[12:15:15] <Cork> 2. each program installed in user folders has to be installed for each user, you can't share them
[12:16:02] <dob1> if you can't watch a youtube video because the dpms is not disabled, well... it's not the right solution!  it's not difficult to understand
[12:16:37] <xx> yeah I am currently trying to work around an issue of the screensaver not being disabled when watching stuff
[12:17:18] <dob1> it seems so simple, it's not right what you are doing... so don't do it
[12:17:39] *** Joins: mz` (~mz`@user/mz/x-8532539)
[12:19:33] <Cork> would prob just have a bash script use xset to disable it
[12:19:50] <Cork> there are ui extensions for gnomeshell and kde that works well too

[12:21:36] <dob1> Cork, you right, you can manually switch it off with xset... but it's not a solution neither a workaroud
[12:21:58] <Cork> depends on what your trying to handle
[12:22:30] <Cork> i do have a dbus client command line that inhibits the screensaver somewhere too
[12:22:33] <xx> I just have xscreensaver installed and dbus properly configured and allowed for the firefox snap/flatpak/firejail/whatever
[12:23:27] <dob1> but it's a bit different
[12:23:38] <dob1> you have not to disable dpms while firefox is running

[12:23:53] <dob1> the logic is to disable it while watching a video
[12:24:15] <dob1> you can do, script, whatever before starting firefox but you can't do this by yourself
[12:24:27] <Cork> in the best of worlds sure, but it is better to be able to disable it when you don't want it then it fireing on you when you don't want to
[12:25:03] <Cork> so it isn't meant as a fix in any sense of the word, more of a "at least you can get something working"
[12:25:32] <dob1> I keep the browser open all the time, this is me and how I use my pc, it's not usefult in my case a manual solution
[12:25:35] <Cork> for a perfect full fix the isolation most likely needs to be fixed
[12:25:54] <dob1> (and not to consider that closing/opening the browser with snap will require more time now)
[12:27:16] <Cork> another option is to just open youtube in mpv :)
[12:29:03] <dob1> yes true :)
[12:29:51] <Cork> i rarely ever open youtube in the browser, it is suce a heavy mess
[12:31:27] <dob1> depends, if you want a particular video, but if you want to search for something, or look at suggested video while watching one, I like these features

[20:05:24] <anotheryou> the add-on settings are really most annoying
