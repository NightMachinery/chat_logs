[00:02:21] <OnlineCop> A string being a single word (or multiple space-separated words)? Are sentences those that end in a period, question mark, exclamation point, etc.?

[00:04:18] <OnlineCop> What do you want to match, or not match?
[00:05:18] <cmarabate> I explained that under "WHAT I WANT TO ACHIEVE..."
[00:05:27] <cmarabate> I want this to find a match in the first sentence. I don't want it to care if "except this Champion" is in a sentence that does not also contain "50% \[Increase ATK\]"
[00:05:52] <OnlineCop> I saw that comment, but what do you mean "don't want it to care"?
[00:06:16] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/s8E8V6/2 for example.
[00:07:12] <OnlineCop> That will NOT match if there's a "except this Champion" before the '.' in the first sentence.
[00:07:15] <cmarabate> Well it is currently finding no matches because  "50% \[Increase ATK\]" is in the first sentence and except this Champion is in the second sentence. I need it to look at each sentence separattly 
[00:07:25] <re101-coral-39> I'm looking to replace "&#xx;" from an group of words with regex.replace, any help with this?
[00:07:31] <OnlineCop> Note that `.*` at the end then matches "everything" so may also need to be changed to [^.]*
[00:07:53] <OnlineCop> cmarabate: https://regex101.com/r/s8E8V6/3
[00:08:17] <cmarabate> Perfect! thanks you so much!
[00:08:22] <OnlineCop> My pleasure.
[00:08:35] <OnlineCop> re101-coral-39: Do you want to replace it with "nothing"?
[00:08:47] <re101-coral-39> Yes
[00:09:12] <OnlineCop> `s/&#[0-9a-fA-F]{2}`//g` ?
[00:09:52] <re101-coral-39> I have an email with html tags which I was able to replace but few emails have these "&#22; &#23;" and some few more numbers.
[00:09:53] <OnlineCop> !regex s/&#[0-9a-fA-F]{2}//g Foo&#20;Bar&#23;Baz

[00:10:14] <OnlineCop> The `&#` will match those two characters literally.
[00:10:25] <OnlineCop> The `[0-9a-fA-F]{2}` will match the next 2 hex values.
[00:10:50] <OnlineCop> You may want to include a ';' in there to get rid of the entire &#xx;

[00:11:53] <re101-coral-39> Got it, now is there a way to only include the numbers from 32-126 in that &#xx?
[00:12:34] <OnlineCop> Hex or decimal?
[00:12:39] <re101-coral-39> hex
[00:12:39] <OnlineCop> !range 32 126

[00:13:12] <OnlineCop> Off the top of your head, do you remember what those hex values are?
[00:13:35] <OnlineCop> 0x20 to 0x7e ?
[00:13:42] <OnlineCop> !range 0x20 0x7e
[00:13:47] <OnlineCop> !range -h 0x20 0x7e
[00:14:25] <re101-coral-39> For example among "&#23; &#28; &#48; &#134;" I still want to retain &#48; but rest to be replaced with nothing.
[00:15:17] <OnlineCop> Oh, so exclude 0x00..0x1f and 0xff ?
[00:15:55] <re101-coral-39> If in decimal?
[00:16:24] <re101-coral-39> Yes, if in decimal?
[00:18:55] <re101-coral-39> right now I have httpUtility.htmlDecode(Regex.Replace(string, "<(.|\n*?>","")) to replace html tags but the numbers are still there.
[00:19:59] <OnlineCop> Isn't &#23 higher than 32d?
[00:20:17] <OnlineCop> That would be 35 (decimal), wouldn't it?
[00:22:53] <re101-coral-39> UTF-8 in HTTP Headers
[00:25:22] <re101-coral-39> I need it in dec, not hex. Sorry for the confusion.
[00:26:26] <re101-coral-39> I want to retain only the dec numbers from 32-126 in that &#xx?
[00:28:57] <OnlineCop> If you want decimal 32-126, you'd change `&#[0-9a-fA-F]{2}` to probably `&#(?:3[2-9]|[4-9]\d|1[01]\d|12[0-6])`
[00:32:00] <OnlineCop> Whoops; left of the trailing ';' again.
[00:33:10] <re101-coral-39> So `&#(?:3[2-9]|[4-9]\d|1[01]\d|12[0-6]);` should retain 32-126 and replace other numbers, correct?
[00:33:41] <OnlineCop> My question was to clarify that the HTTP header contains the literal text &#32 through &#fe that you would like to keep, but replace &#00 through &#1f and &#7f through &#ff with "nothing" ?
[00:34:19] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/aTV8jp/1
[00:34:42] <re101-coral-39> The HTTP header is having only dec format numbers, so want to retain &#32; to &#126; and nothing else.
[00:35:03] <OnlineCop> Oh, so it's not &#[hex][hex]?
[00:35:41] <re101-coral-39> no, it is &#[dec][dec];
[00:35:44] <OnlineCop> (scroll down in that regex I pasted above; it should have &#00; through &#255; as well.
[00:36:16] <OnlineCop> So basically, you want to remove everything NOT matching in that above link, and keep everything that IS matching?
[00:36:39] <re101-coral-39> Yes, thats the one, can you paste the final regex code here please.
[00:37:56] <re101-coral-39> only for the &#[dec][dec];
[00:38:17] <OnlineCop> Does https://regex101.com/r/aTV8jp/2 look correct?
[00:38:50] <OnlineCop> By the way, if that IS what you want, use "Code Generator" on the left to get the Javascript-ified version of the .replace() command you could copy-paste.
[00:39:28] <re101-coral-39> Yes, that is perfect.
[00:39:35] <re101-coral-39> Thanks, you are awesome.
[00:40:03] <OnlineCop> My pleasure.

[14:55:19] <re101-civet-12> not like this regex because it is restricting few.now the requirement for the field is it can be filled with anything no restriction there but if user enter the empty space tab alone then it should be restricted .so restrict only white empty space

[15:06:54] <re101-civet-12> thank u for ur time
[15:07:02] <digitok> b3z, is "char" any char? or just letters?
[15:07:10] *** Quits: re101-civet-12 (~re101-civ@2409:4072:6d18:b798:b053:545e:614c:7b93) (Quit: Client closed)
[15:10:11] <digitok> b3z, if it's any char,  (.).\1  if it's only letters,  ([a-z])[a-z]\1
[15:12:53] <digitok> i think re101-civet-12 wanted something like  /^(?!\s*$)/
[15:13:05] <b3z> digitok: any char in my case lower case a-z
[15:13:20] <b3z> digitok: oh yeah then letters
[15:13:35] <b3z> digitok: how does it work?/7
[15:14:50] <digitok> ([a-z])  matches a single a-z char and stores it in backreference 1,  [a-z]  matches another single a-z char, and  \1  matches what's stored in backreference 1
[15:15:21] <digitok> backreferences are also referred to as a groups
[15:15:41] <digitok> or, more specifically, capturing groups
[15:15:44] <b3z> Ah okay. I didn't know backreferences exist. So it basically works like a register or a variable?
[15:15:50] <digitok> yep
[15:16:27] <b3z> digitok: thanks mate
[15:16:32] <digitok> yw :)
[15:18:27] <purplex> yep but when civet said its first and last name i assumed it can't have symbols or digits 
[15:19:11] <digitok> yep
[15:19:51] <digitok> - and ' are common in names, but most ppl do just ask for letters

[20:44:38] <digitok> it could also be because you're using \1 and not using raw literal strings

[20:52:54] <digitok> i assume the 1st assert still fails?

[20:54:43] <digitok> well, i assume so

[22:58:52] <lopid> why not drastically shorten the example?
[23:00:29] <re101-zorse-97> It matches other things which is why I put all that there
[23:01:02] <re101-zorse-97> R U talking abt the test string or what I wanna find?
[23:01:22] <re101-zorse-97> FYI, I'm using Notepad++
[23:02:09] <re101-zorse-97> I'm tryin to find `(?=.*?(mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>-))(?=<br>)`

[23:43:40] <JohnDoe2> re101-zorse-97 are you the famous Doctor who wants to do mass edits on an HTML site with regex?
[23:44:06] <re101-zorse-97> https://regex101.com/r/TNg4oe/1     not mass, only some
[23:44:26] <JohnDoe2> right, that was the only thing I got wrong 😄
[23:46:00] <JohnDoe2> re101-zorse-97 99% of your issues are bad css/html usage. If I were you I'd spend some time on youtube learning how to handle the two, or if that's not something you have time for, hire someone with basic html/css/js knowledge.
[23:46:32] <JohnDoe2> Another option might be to give one of these visual site builders a try (like wix), since most of your content is text and images.
[23:46:44] <re101-zorse-97> If you give me a regex for the above, I promise not to bother you guys for a long time
[23:46:45] <re101-zorse-97> https://regex101.com/r/TNg4oe/1
[23:47:24] <JohnDoe2> Then yet another option is desktop software that is just as point and click but also a bit smarter/less restrictive when compared to platforms like wix.
[23:48:05] <JohnDoe2> You're not bothering, re101-zorse-97, it's just tasks that are not meant for HTML, and in principle the fixes you're trying to implement are inappropriate for the problem at hand.
[23:48:19] <JohnDoe2> by HTML I mean "for regex"
[23:48:53] <re101-zorse-97> I used a word to html editor but it does not put the second line of the para below the first, where the sentence begins with a hyphen
[23:49:40] *** Joins: re101-gecko-10 (~re101-gec@82-73-106-254.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl)
[23:49:47] <re101-zorse-97> digitok gave me RegEx which does that for paragraphs where the para begins with a hyphen
[23:49:49] <genio> oh, phew. I thought you meant MS Word. Then I looked up further and saw np++
[23:50:11] <JohnDoe2> genio no no, you're correct, microsoft word -> html -> np++ for regex replacements to "fix" issues.
[23:50:17] <re101-zorse-97> Now I wanna do that to paragraphs that don't begin with the hyphen
[23:52:24] <re101-zorse-97> Yea JohnDoe2 - you bet that's what I want

[23:55:54] <genio> oh, you poor person
[23:57:08] <re101-zorse-97> If I'm allowed, like JohnDoe said about 4 days ago, I can post a link to my website if I want you guys to read it - am I right?
[23:58:17] <re101-gecko-10> hi guys, i'm looking to get a regex to select the numeric value after the last occurrence of a specific text. For example: I'm using "curl -IL youtube.com" in CLI and from the response I need the value "491054". I can't get it to work, must say I'm quite new to using regex. Can you help me?
[23:59:04] <re101-gecko-10> the numeric value after the last "content-length"
