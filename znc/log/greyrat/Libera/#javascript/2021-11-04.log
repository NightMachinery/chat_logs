[00:03:53] <ljharb> derjanni: i'm not restraining you. you just have to type faster or accept more asynchrony.
[00:04:03] <ljharb> D4mned: babel's transpilation still retains the semantics of let/const
[00:04:17] <ljharb> D4mned: and the parser and linter help enforce those.

[00:05:02] <ljharb> derjanni: yes you can
[00:05:17] <D4mned> so theres actually a way to write a const in es5 ?
[00:05:19] <ljharb> derjanni: how do you think server rendering works?
[00:05:20] <austincheney> derjanni, i wish computer science were separated into low level and high level concerns.  Low level concerns should be c++ (at the extreme highest) but focus on writing to the metal.  High level concerns are architecture and benefit from things like functional programming and philosophy topics

[00:05:48] <ljharb> derjanni: again, if you provided a single counterclaim instead of a bunch of name calling and cursing you'd be more credible

[00:12:49] <qswz> a framework is like a background thing
[00:12:50] <ljharb> derjanni: `setTimeout` isn't a framework just because the engine invokes your callback
[00:13:03] <qswz> React has to register event lsteners and call you code

[00:15:56] <ljharb> derjanni: like inside the abstraction layer.
[00:16:04] <derjanni> ljharb: just because you have memory management doesn't mean you don't have memory.

[00:18:51] <ljharb> derjanni: setTimeout/setInterval are NOT part of the standard library - they're not in the language, they're in the web. and node.
[00:18:58] <ljharb> derjanni: sure but then it violates the JS spec, and is no longer a JS engine

[00:37:49] <derjanni> oh lord.
[00:38:41] <derjanni> 20 years ago in the #javascript channel on Freenode we had serious debates about interpreter performance and memory utilisation in JavaScript. What have we become?
[00:38:58] <derjanni> Am I just too old?
[00:39:10] <austincheney> https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455
[00:39:24] <neshpion> derjanni: yes :^)
[00:40:09] <derjanni> neshpion: thank you that at least gives me the confidence that obviously there's a new generation that can't differentiate between a library and a framework and has serious issues with academic institutions and research.
[00:40:14] <derjanni> I can live with that.
[00:40:34] <derjanni> Let them grow up.

[00:41:18] <ljharb> we've learned better
[00:41:43] <ljharb> they did 20 years ago, to be fair. but they don't now.
[00:41:52] <austincheney> 20 years ago JS was interpreted which means it executed hundreds of times slower
[00:42:21] <derjanni> austincheney: so JS is not longer interpreted? Interesting. What's the name of your JS compiler?

[00:42:37] <austincheney> the performance concerns of 20 years ago don't which now which is why people feel so entitled to abuse such massive frameworks
[00:42:47] <ljharb> i mean, technically only implementations are compiled or interpreted
[00:43:06] <ljharb> but colloquially, languages are - which is why JS is interpreted, and C++ is compiled, even tho you can interpret or compile both
[00:43:13] <austincheney> I have to go get a haircut
[00:43:30] <ljharb> derjanni: v8 - the thing you wanted to show me the code of - compiles JS code on the fly, as do most engines these days

[00:45:59] <derjanni> ljharb: whatever you define as "on the fly". Wasn't aware that JavaScript Interpreters are able to "fly".
[00:46:06] <ljharb> derjanni: sure but the proper terms for things aren't needed when literally everyone knows what's intended
[00:46:17] <qswz> on{event} is for inline handlers, which should not be used most of time
[00:46:19] <derjanni> ljharb: nevermind. it's about professionalism.
[00:46:26] <ljharb> derjanni: if you don't understand common idioms, especially ones commonly used in tech, then i'm not sure how to help you
[00:46:32] <neshpion> isn't "on*" just syntactically how you write the event "*" as an element attribute?
[00:46:53] <ljharb> derjanni: professionalism is not "pedantically correcting someone when it's obvious what they unambiguously mean"
[00:47:06] <neshpion> derjanni: i don't think there's anything unprofessional about the phrase "on the fly"
[00:47:17] <ljharb> there isn't

[01:29:52] <DPA> A gcc/c/glibc/linux question: If I have an unchangeable global data structure, and it has pointers in it, then it can't just be mmapped by the elf loader, can it? It has to be relocated and each program instance will take up new memory?
[01:30:36] <DPA> Sorry, wrong channel...

[01:31:49] <derjanni> DPA: Correct. Each process will allocate new memory.
[01:32:46] <derjanni> DPA: this is regardless of what the pointers point to. The system will not allow other processes to access the memory, even if they are processes of the same application. There are of course exceptions to it.

[01:38:39] <DPA> If 2 processes mmap the same file, they will share the same physical pages, although having different logical ones. ELF binaies are also mmaped into memory. So some sharing of ro memory should be possible to some extent.
[01:38:39] <DPA> So it being 2 different processes should not be the root of the issue.

[07:53:09] <Crash1hd> and I was not done lol
[07:53:55] <gde33> Crash1hd: I have no idea what it does or why you are doing this but cant you put the    item === null || item === void 0 ? void 0    in a function of its own?
[07:54:30] <gde33> also, when things are complex to you use if else rather than ?: and ||
[07:54:48] <gde33> your future self will apperciate it
[07:55:02] <Crash1hd> ironically I find ternary's easier to read.
[07:55:45] <Crash1hd> gde33, but re line 574 moving it to its own function is what you where saying?
[07:56:28] <gde33> make  item === null || item === void    into   banana(item) ?
[07:57:08] <poiqwepoiqwe> logging to console introduces overhead ... exactly what's going on to cause the successive increases idk so that's why i say its the tail of the problem
[07:57:23] <gde33> could clear the console

[08:09:29] <gde33> right
[08:09:32] <Rockwood> i need good admin template
[08:09:42] <Rockwood> any suggestion about it?
[08:09:48] <Crash1hd> gde33, also I am pretty sure subComponents is a typo haha but its what I have to work with for now. :)
[08:10:19] <ravindUwU> Rockwood, wdym by "admin template"? 🤔
[08:10:35] <Rockwood> means?
[08:11:14] <Rockwood> i don't want invest time in create template
[08:11:43] <Rockwood> sb admin enough?
[08:11:51] <Rockwood> https://startbootstrap.com/previews/sb-admin-2
[08:12:29] <poiqwepoiqwe> what's wrong with that?
[08:13:26] <Rockwood> nothing
[08:13:34] <Rockwood> i am worried about nested things
[08:14:22] <Rockwood> mostly i used non framework stuff (manually code in html css js )
[08:14:53] <ravindUwU> I typically just stick to a solid UI component library and build it up from there. I've seen so many frontend templates with graphs, excessive preload and page load animations and they're usually bloated AF.
[08:14:54] <Rockwood> its first time i am going to use BT
[08:14:56] <poiqwepoiqwe> ahhh i thought you had an irrational fear of eggs
[08:15:48] <Rockwood> animation make site slower so i wanna avoid animation on this project

[18:30:19] <ThePhilgrim> Hi, I'm trying to wrap my head around nested objects in Javascript. Here I have an object called spaceship. It has a property called "passengers". The property of passengers should be an Array of passenger objects. But I get an error that I can't seem to understand. https://dpaste.com/BY5SPGMP7
[18:30:37] <thykka> what is the error?
[18:31:00] <thykka> ah
[18:31:01] <ThePhilgrim> passengerOne: { "unexpected token" syntax error..
[18:31:12] <ThePhilgrim> But I can't understand what it needs to be instead
[18:31:16] <thykka> passengers is an array, but you're giving it keys, like an object
[18:31:48] <ThePhilgrim> This is the tutorial instructions that I'm following: "Right now the passengers property has a value of null. Instead, assign as its value an array of objects. These objects should represent the spaceship‘s passengers as individual objects. Make at least one passenger object in the array that has at least one key-value pair on it."
[18:31:53] <thykka> what you want is more like: passengers: [ { name: 'Phil', 'favorite food': 'Pizza' }, { name: 'Sara', 'favorite food': 'Sushi' } ]
[18:32:30] <ThePhilgrim> hmm, so you can't access them by property names.. you have to do passengers[0] for example?
[18:32:39] *** Quits: stenno\OK (~stenno@user/stenno) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[18:32:40] <thykka> array elements don't have names
[18:32:56] <ThePhilgrim> Oh, okay
[18:32:57] <thykka> so yeah, by index, or by a search function or w/e
[18:33:41] <Booster2ooo> Or use an object
[18:33:55] <thykka> looks like an array is the right choice in this data structure
[18:34:27] *** Quits: pavonia (~user@user/siracusa) (Quit: Bye!)
[18:34:52] <ThePhilgrim> Hmm, so to make sure I'm following - when you have an object property that is an array of objects, the objects in the array don't have names, only their own properties?

[18:37:58] <thykka> arrays are technically objects, but I wouldn't ever recommend doing this ^
[18:38:01] <systemfault> Way to confuse a clueless person.
[18:38:04] <thykka> :D
[18:38:10] <thykka> yeah
[18:38:40] <thykka> i've only seen someone assign properties to an array once, and they thought it was common practise. I hope it's not.
[18:38:45] <thykka> keep it simple
[18:39:16] <ljharb> thykka: regex match objects are that tho. it's very uncommon otherwise, thankfully.

[19:59:13] <dpuerto> Alo. On line 82 of https://codepen.io/dapinitial/pen/ad4ed13401e2ad1e3d8ca4d71993fd0a I start a modal container that I want to dynamically render the content based on the position in the JSON. It's only showing the first position from the v-for loop that I'm using in the render template. I'm not sure how I can resolve this. I was triggering it via CSS only, but maybe I need to use a click event. I'd prefer to leave it as is.
[19:59:13] <dpuerto>  Any ideas?
[20:00:59] <ThePhilgrim> Hi again, the console.log at the bottom of this code works well! But I am wondering why I cannot do "console.log(`${crewMember}: ${spaceship.crew.crewMember.name}`)"

[20:11:39] <jellobot> ThePhilgrim, yourObject.foobar is just another way of saying yourObject['foobar']. So of course if varName = 'foobar', then it's also the same as yourObject[varName]. Dot notation is preferred to bracket notation except where the property name would be an invalid identifier. The same applies to quoting keys inside object literals - don't do it unless you have to.

[22:02:20] <systemfault> Deneb: Start by never shadowing your variables
[22:02:56] <systemfault> (You declare it twice)
[22:03:09] * systemfault One of the two doesn't make sense to me.
[22:03:36] <systemfault> Why did my client do that without me using /me ...
[22:03:59] <Deneb> shadowing variables?
[22:06:03] <Deneb> just reading this, but don't get it yet: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-variable-shadowing-in-java
[22:06:40] <systemfault> If you do: function A(a) { function (a) { YOU_CANT_ACCESS_THE_OUTER_A_FROM_HERE } }
[22:07:10] <systemfault> You're doing exactly that with storageObj
[22:07:41] <systemfault> And I'm not even sure why it's at line 14 to be honest...
[22:08:07] <systemfault> The onload callback doesn't give back a storageObj as its second callback argument
[22:08:27] <Deneb> ok, I understand what your getting at, but isn't that why the variable has to be passed which I am doing?
[22:09:15] <systemfault> function foo(a) { function bar() { function baz() { YOU_CAN_STILL_USE_A_HERE }}}
[22:09:34] <systemfault> Inner functions have access to their outer scope variable.
[22:09:51] <systemfault> The TLDR here... remove the useless storageObj declaration at line 14
[22:11:34] <Deneb> its about the function saveFile(). Because its within freader.onload() it can't be called without reference to the class object. This function is nested inside function storage() as is this.saveFile()
[22:12:23] <Deneb> calling this.safeFile() also causes an error
[22:12:57] <systemfault> ...
[22:13:04] <systemfault> Do you even read what I'm writing?
[22:13:16] <systemfault> That reference to storageObj at line 14 doesn't do anything at all
[22:13:33] <systemfault> The read storageObj is declared at line 2
[22:14:10] <systemfault> And that variable is accessible everywhere inside the function, include the inner function that you assign to freader.onload

[22:21:17] <Deneb> so the declaratioon at line 14 I guess is shadowing? Because the var has already been declared the second declaration conflicts with it. I think I got that.

[22:46:11] <Deneb> systemfault: ok, I will do some more research on AJAX. The example I saw was for a download from a server which would be more typical I suppose. I imagine it must be possible to modify the approach for a local save to disk somehow. Apreciate your help.
[22:46:41] <systemfault> That, I don't know :/

[22:48:28] <Deneb> interesting. Will have a look.
[22:49:26] <systemfault> To be honest, I'd be surprised that AJAX would work for writing files...
[22:50:37] <systemfault> What you can easily do though... is use createobjecturl to create a "fake url" for a blob and then create a <a> with that URL and a "download" attribute, then trigger a click on it to show a download box

[23:10:18] <qswz> CSS stuff is complex, many layers
[23:10:30] <qswz> element.style is just the direct inlien style
[23:10:32] <stenno\OK> for me 'basic web development' sounds like 'lets make a todo app' or something like that
[23:11:14] <wovixo> I'd like to make it a course where the students would be using tools/frameworks/etc. that they might use in the "Real World".
[23:11:32] <gehn> people use HTML and CSS in the real world
[23:11:35] <gehn> lots of them in fact
[23:12:09] <stenno\OK> you will not be able to teach html when you abstract it through e.g. react
[23:12:11] <wovixo> I'm not against PHP for example, since it's still heavily used, but maybe move towards more recent tools. React? Angular (shudder)? Svelte? There's too many to contemplate!
[23:12:15] <gehn> I mean, there are many things I'd probably "like to", but I would imagine there are usually some amount of constraints around this situation, i.e. expectations of what you'll teach
[23:12:26] <gehn> who is paying you to do this teaching? ask them what they expect you to teach
[23:12:30] <stenno\OK> php is a backend language, not a frontend framework
[23:12:53] <wovixo> Right, but simple back-end is included.
[23:13:02] <stenno\OK> inb4 'php is a glorified templating language'
[23:13:06] <systemfault> They can't teach modern frontend dev in schools... you need to know too many things
[23:13:57] <stenno\OK> maybe keep a bit of time to talk about it at the end
[23:14:03] <stenno\OK> like dedicate the last week to react or w/e
[23:14:16] <wovixo> That's the problem I'm having. On the back-end, I think sticking with Node would be fine, since it exposes you to routing in a simple way, but the front-end is tough to narrow down.
[23:14:25] <qswz> 1 week per topic
[23:14:29] <gehn> frontend is easy to narrow down: react
[23:14:55] <systemfault> qswz: You can't create "course" for the elite only...
[23:14:57] <stenno\OK> i still don't think that it makes sense to abstract the frontend
[23:14:58] <gehn> and or maybe some amount of "vanilla" at first, but that is useful for both backend and frontend (when backend = node)
[23:15:20] <wovixo> Yeah, that's what I'm leaning towards. I like Svelte a lot, but it's not quite popular enough yet.
[23:15:21] <stenno\OK> just do vanilla HTML + DOM JS
[23:15:27] <qswz> html, css, dom, express, sql, preact
[23:15:46] <wovixo> Maybe I'll just make them use WASM for everything.
[23:15:52] <stenno\OK> if you'd introduce stuff like JSX it will make it more complicated
[23:16:01] <stenno\OK> and virtualdom
[23:16:15] <qswz> it's just a templating engine
[23:16:26] <qswz> like others, even simpler one as the expressions are pure JS
[23:16:27] <stenno\OK> not neccessarily more complicated but it fails the targot of teaching basic web stuff
[23:16:34] <gehn> how do we know though?
[23:16:38] <gehn> no one has defined "basic"
[23:16:46] <gehn> well, more importantly, OP hasn't
[23:16:49] <gehn> we're all just guessing
[23:17:02] <qswz> sure, you may want to prepare them for the pain of angular, vue and shit
[23:17:12] <stenno\OK> lol
[23:17:50] <gehn> what is the expectation of students' level of computer literacy when they enter your class?
[23:17:56] <wovixo> Right, well, "basic" means that at the end, they'd have the ability to create a site of 'moderate' complexity - including having the understanding of how HTML/CSS/JS interact on the front-end, and how they 'communicate' with the back-end.

[23:25:11] <qswz> it's better to combine stuff
[23:25:39] <gehn> what are shell expansions, what are globs, what even is a shell? what's the difference between a shell and a terminal? what is unicode? why does PowerShell refuse to output anything other than UTF-16 or UTF-8 WITH BOM (linux tools typically barf on UTF-8 when there is a BOM)
[23:25:40] <wovixo> There's actually a DevOps course that they'll take as well - separate class. So I might just have them use some kind of cloud UI connected to github.

[23:35:30] <jaawerth> I take it for granted a lot but recently it happened 3 times in a week where I got involved in some gnarly broken thing in a codebase I rarely touch and I was like "oh well the problem is here" and when I took them through it it turned into wild tangents. even things like `git log -pG 'what-commits-broke-this-line-of-code'` or even just rg/git grep
[23:35:34] <qswz> extra ( ) ,  trailing || it's terrible
[23:35:50] <qswz> it could all be one-lined
[23:36:07] <efdee> change printWidth to get it to online that stuff
[23:36:11] <efdee> *inline
[23:36:27] <efdee> as for the (), i guess that's personal. i prefer it to be explicit. maybe it can be configured.

[23:48:05] <qswz> prettier with printWidth: 9999999999 is actually decent
[23:48:17] <efdee> 160 or so should do the trick ;-)
[23:48:21] <qswz> and your editor line wrap
[23:49:11] <qswz> it's terrible, because if you decide to change this, all your project is reformatted
[23:49:27] <jaawerth> though what I shared is only 65 characters at its max width
[23:49:30] <efdee> that's what prettier does. if you don't like that, don't use prettier? :-)
