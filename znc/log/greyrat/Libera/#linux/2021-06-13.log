[00:33:34] <Compy> Curious, I'm running Arch on an i3 Intel NUC with integrated graphics (11th Gen Tiger Canyon). It has 2 HDMI ports.  I'm curious, I'm trying to diagnose why one of the ports won't work (running the i915 driver and X11). My question is how exactly does xrandr detect/name the inputs? For example, HDMI Port 1 is actually showing up as DP2.

[04:48:09] <schuelermine> what 1. link?
[04:48:13] <denny> So the thing with txtspk abbreviations is they save time for the person typing, but cost everybody reading a little extra time to process them. So they're a way of saying you care more about the 3 seconds you save than the 1 second multiplies by 1007 people in here that it costs. Buuuuuut, the reaslly common ones like 'u' are quite easy to process. Unless English isn't your first language, at which point you're being rude to everybody else AND kinda
[04:48:13] <denny> racist or whatever. So, tricky stuff. Probably best to type whole words, all in all.

[06:18:36] <e36freak> fdisk/mkfs is all you neeeed

[14:10:38] <Alina-malina> i think they not support x86 anymore
[14:10:47] <Alina-malina> i can do gentoo
[14:11:02] <colo> Debian still does x86 just fine
[14:11:20] <Alina-malina> my candidates were void and gentoo and arch tbh
[14:11:26] <pyfisch> Alina-malin: There is https://archlinux32.org/
[14:11:26] <bsandro> i used antix on 1st gen P4 just few months ago, works just fine
[14:11:35] <Alina-malina> ye pyfisch but i think its abandoned or something
[14:12:17] <Alina-malina> ig should remove all what i have there and install from scratch everything and test those repositories, last time i had wireguard issues, its just not compatible or osmething

[14:44:22] <denny> commandline leaks via its history, doesn't it? ENV is possibly more contained, depending on when/how you set them, possibly, I have no idea what I'm talking about and it's always made me nervous too since I started doing webapps that use ENV for secrets.

[14:46:07] <RayTracer> cmdline leaks also via ps -ef; I think this has more possible viewers in default installs than ability to strings /proc/pid/environ from other users

[17:06:29] <cheater> when doing cp, is it possible to copy files with zero size, i.e. only create the file, and not create any contents?
[17:06:56] <lopid> that's not copying it
[17:07:21] <cheater> creating symlinks isn't copying either but cp can do symlinks so what's your point :)

[17:23:37] <cheater> in the time we've been talking the whole fs is almost checked by using mkdir and touch

[23:47:05] <renic> The news coming out about freenode has been shocking and weird.
[23:47:38] <renic> why ops think people would stick around after stong arm tactics... is just... incomprehensible.

[23:52:21] *** Quits: choegusung (~choegusun@user/choegusung) (Client Quit)
[23:52:27] <NGC3982> renic: but it's also rather synonymous with big companies going with the "we are too big to care about the little guy" thing
[23:52:33] <themachine> masber: So you won't intend on hosting the mail yourself, you just want an ESP that allows for custom domains?
[23:52:34] <renic> masber - zoho is a pretty good option if you just want normal oldschool mail service... google still an option too but has cost.
[23:53:01] <masber> yeah something like google business email
[23:53:04] <rascul> fasemail
[23:53:07] <rascul> *fastmail
[23:53:22] <masber> where I can point my MX records to it
[23:53:26] <renic> I've user zoho for several small companies in the past.  is free... is functional.
[23:53:36] <NGC3982> renic: also lol, that site is so excessive. :D
[23:53:37] <masber> free??
[23:53:43] <masber> thats too good to be true
[23:53:54] <thebuzzing> migadu is nice.
[23:54:00] * themachine doesn't trust free email
