[00:04:10] <jmcantrell> In Firefox or chromium, what determines the styling of form controls when the system color scheme is dark? Shouldn’t preferred_color_scheme=dark produce the same behavior in qutebrowser?
[00:05:50] <The-Compiler> jmcantrell: guess so, but it'd be a QtWebEngine-issue most likely if it does not, and given that we pass arguments to the underlying Chromium directly, I'm not sure if they care
[00:07:16] <jmcantrell> Ok, that gets me a step closer. Thanks
[00:07:41] <The-Compiler> jmcantrell: if you open an issue I might take a look and see if there's something we can do
[00:08:54] <jmcantrell> Ok. I might do that when I can wrap my mind around the behavior.

[00:50:58] <jmcantrell> Is there no way to pass "--blink-settings=darkMode=4,darkModeImagePolicy=2" to qtwebengine? I tried setting QTWEBENGINE_CHROMIUM_FLAGS, but got a warning suggesting to use qt.args.
[00:52:01] <jmcantrell> What I've found seems to suggest that those blink settings are equivalent to --enable-force-dark

[00:55:02] <jmcantrell> --qt-flag blink-settings=darkMode=4,darkModeImagePolicy=2 seems to pass it (according to the debug log output), but it doesn't have any effect on form control styling
[01:00:45] <jmcantrell> QTWEBENGINE_CHROMIUM_FLAGS=--force-dark-mode seems to have the same affect for falkon (which uses qtwebengine) as preferred_color_scheme=dark does for qutebrowser. Neither have any affect on form controls. So this is probably qtwebengine's fault, which you suggested already.
[01:02:02] <The-Compiler> jmcantrell: hmm, last time I checked, --force-dark-mode did nothing
[01:02:30] <The-Compiler> jmcantrell: confusingly, --blink-settings=darkMode is something else entirely, that's where Chromium filters the webpages to all be dark
[01:02:50] <The-Compiler> (colors.webpage.darkmode.* in qutebrowser)
[01:04:08] <The-Compiler> ah, right, --force-dark-mode vs. --blink-settings=preferredColorScheme=0 depends on your QtWebEngine version
[01:04:11] <jmcantrell> i wonder what causes the difference between chromium (correct form control styling with chrome://flags/#enable-force-dark) and qtwebengine (every setting i've tried)
[01:04:46] <The-Compiler> enable-force-dark is a different thing
[01:05:33] <jmcantrell> it's something special implemented in chromium that's not available to blink?
[01:05:47] <The-Compiler> no, there are two different things called dark mode
[01:06:10] <The-Compiler> one where the website supplies a dark stylesheet, and one where the browser repaints things to be dark
[01:06:33] <The-Compiler> #enable-force-dark is the latter
[01:06:49] <The-Compiler> and e.g.   qutebrowser --temp-basedir -s colors.webpage.darkmode.enabled true 'https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_form_text'   will give you dark form elements too
[01:07:29] <The-Compiler> but you were asking about colors.webpage.preferred_color_scheme (preferredColorScheme) which just lets the website know that the user would like a dark style sheet
[01:09:16] <The-Compiler> but actually this gives me dark form controls too:   qutebrowser --temp-basedir -s colors.webpage.preferred_color_scheme dark 'https://codepen.io/somelaniesaid/pen/oNzvYRJ'   
[01:09:20] <The-Compiler> so I don't follow
[01:12:27] <jmcantrell> check out the buttons at the bottom of the page here: https://cbracco.github.io/html5-test-page/
[01:13:33] <jmcantrell> or the dialogs for any of the date inputs or selects
[01:14:12] <The-Compiler> ok, so that page has no dark styling, so colors.webpage.preferred_color_scheme will do nothing
[01:15:23] <The-Compiler> I can see what you mean with colors.webpage.darkmode.enabled though
[01:15:31] <jmcantrell> compare that with how the same page looks in chromium with chrome://flags/#enable-force-dark
[01:16:47] <jmcantrell> i'm just confused by why they look so different if they're using the same renderer.
[01:17:23] <The-Compiler> Probably should open an issue at this point as I'm off to bed

[01:18:01] <The-Compiler> not sure how the rendering of buttons and such works exactly, QtWebEngine might be using Qt elements or something there, but I don't think it does!

[18:06:15] <kenaryn> I found a solution too but it's not as ergonomic as I though: after having mousing-over the targeted item with ';h' you have to yank the url with ';y' then put in the clipboard with 'pp'.
[18:08:18] <kenaryn> the URL on focus cannot be yanked without leaving the mouse-over mode it's a bit annoying and counter-intuitive, although qutebrowser is incredibly good.

[19:30:38] <yamichan> uwaaaa the functionality i'm looking for, it was already more or less built in >w<
[19:30:47] <yamichan> this line in the config file appears to suffice
[19:30:48] <yamichan> c.fonts.web.family.sans_serif = 'Arial DotGothic16'
[19:31:13] <yamichan> cause then it just tries the english font first and then uses the japanese font when it hits characters the english font doesn't have
[19:56:35] <kenaryn_> How can I yank the current webpage's URL in clipboard?
[20:01:28] <The-Compiler> kenaryn_: I still don't follow, why not just use 'f' instead of ;h, ;y and pp
[20:01:38] <The-Compiler> kenaryn_: as for yanking the current URL, yy

[20:22:24] <kenaryn_> The-Compiler: that is because mouse-over allows you to check the URL before following it with 'f' .

[20:26:30] <kenaryn__> On a side note, what is passthrough mode? Is it intended to either force the insert mode or escaping it right?

[20:32:06] <MacGyver> kenaryn__: Typing `fg` in the terminal will bring it back.
[20:32:51] <kenaryn__> arf that's why kenaryn (without any _) hasn't quit due to timeout yet. Thanks :)
