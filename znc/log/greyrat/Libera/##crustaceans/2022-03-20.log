[15:28:14] <epilys> If i'm interviewing for a startup and their public git repositories (i.e. their product) look like a horrible mess with >200 branches, inconsistent tags, commits messages, hundreds of issues and open PRs, do I tell the CEO I see it's a mess or do I pretend I don't see the red flag just to get money?

[16:47:36] <riv> wait those are red flags?
[16:47:41] <riv> i thought that was normal
[16:47:56] <Brekkjern> It is.
[16:48:32] <companion_cube> their product is open source? that's pretty nice
[16:48:49] <companion_cube> if people open issues and PRs it's also possibly successful?
[16:54:12] <epilys> thanks for grounding me, I think now I was being unreasonable
[16:54:17] <epilys> :D
[16:54:53] <skyl4rk> maybe depends on the number of developers, I'd think that in a one-man-operation it's less of a problem, the /entire/ setup has a low bus-factor
[16:54:54] <companion_cube> look at VSCode's repo and tell us if they have open issues ;)
[16:55:13] <skyl4rk> with many developers, it may be a sign that they do not have any thought-out workflow
[16:55:32] <skyl4rk> (caveat emptor: waddoiknow)
[16:55:32] <epilys> I'm just obsessed with clean history and no backlogs
[16:56:17] <epilys> woooo published my first pip package.
[16:56:53] <skyl4rk> that's nice to have, but how much time is worth spending on that kind of thing when your actual needs sometimes do not fit smoothly into neatly packaged things to begin do and end?
[16:58:11] <epilys> skyl4rk, thankfully I'm not that obsessive, I can accept letting things go, it's a mild thing
[17:00:00] <gerikson> epilys: once you progress into the hiring, that's a valid qustion to ask them
[17:00:30] <skyl4rk> I have a bunch of tasks stuck in limbo because 1) they were nice-to-have and development started 2) things were reprioritized, 3) they are still nice to have, so let's not throw away the work already done
[17:02:40] <epilys> skyl4rk, that's totally valid and reasonable.
[17:03:16] <skyl4rk> agree with gerikson though, it's not an invalid concern, but maybe forego "your git's shit" in favor of "what is your way of working with version control/branching strategies/release flow, how does that tie into automated CI etc etc"
[17:03:17] <epilys> gerikson, don't know if I reach that far :(
[17:03:57] <epilys> "your git's shit" as a new hire, or maybe as anything, is totally aggressive and impolite and never justified
[17:04:01] <riv> lol
[17:04:27] <companion_cube> "how do you deal with old open issues" is a legit question, but yeah, don't criticize
[17:04:33] <skyl4rk> why, it's short, catchy, and gets the point across :p
[17:05:02] <riv> it sounds like one of those annoying blob titles
[17:05:07] <epilys> I think I was overreacting, it's not "a horrible mess"
[17:06:18] <epilys> anyway, the position is for "* developer" but the CEO was asking me if I know kubernetes so I think they might only offer me another position instead at most
[17:07:46] <skyl4rk> maybe, but these kind of workflow things are not unimportant, I mean you care about what language they program in for example, because it affects your work. How they work with releases etc, and for that matter, documentation, is also important, but perhaps swept under the rug a bit comparatively speaking.
[17:08:49] <epilys> skyl4rk, I bet if one was hired, except if the management is toxic, one could make things better in that regard.
[17:09:33] <epilys> Setting up styles, procedures, automation are "do once" costs
[17:10:20] <skyl4rk> I thought that too...

[17:32:31] <gwozniak> gerikson: wow... *sock actually going there?  Pretty lame.
[17:32:56] <gerikson> so much idiocy in that thread tbh
[17:33:18] <gwozniak> Which thread?  The interview one?
[17:36:28] <gwozniak> ``Repeated claims of “interviews are so hard, I get anxious, etc. etc.” in order to get an easier-to-pass process are also social engineering.''
[17:36:31] <gwozniak> oh ffs
[17:38:00] <edk> the interview thread is horrible and it shouldn't be on lobsters but i actually sort of almost agree with the original article
[17:38:21] <gwozniak> I guess I should read the article...
[17:38:44] <edk> one assumption that i'm making: coding interviews *can* be bad if they depend on lots of knowledge, but they can also be elementary problem-solving that doesn't require any cramming
[17:39:20] <gwozniak> Our team at work is interviewing 4 people next week.  Our code interview portion is basically what you describe
[17:40:13] <gwozniak> It's not about solving shortest-path or any such thing, it's finding out how much they know about the skills listed in the job description
[17:40:46] <gwozniak> If you don't know what a pointer is in C, for example, well, you probably aren't going to fare well
[17:41:09] <gwozniak> But do you need to know the signature of obscure stdlib functions?  No.
[17:42:23] <edk> i think knowing the signature of functions is more a question of style than anything else
[17:43:20] <edk> and also how much C one has written recently
[17:43:24] <gwozniak> We did an interview recently and we got much more insight into the candidate by showing them some code and talking about it than them writing anything
[17:47:23] <gwozniak> Also, none of us senior folks remember all those signatures.  We look them up. :)
[17:50:05] <gwozniak> Another thing our interview team tries to make clear (and we genuinely mean it) is that when we do present a coding question, we say that the candidate should not be worried about being wrong.  We are really looking at the process.
[17:50:22] <gwozniak> But I think it's that fear of being wrong that is the big hang up for many
[17:52:43] <gwozniak> Reading this article and I'm more convinced that asking candidates to read some code is better than getting them to write some
[17:54:15] <Geekingfrog> What's your view about discussing code that the candidate wrote themself, and shared with you beforehand?
[17:54:20] <Geekingfrog> Not always possible ofc
[17:55:07] <gwozniak> Part of our interview process is for the candidate to bring some code they wrote and walk us through it
[17:55:12] <ngoldbaum> that’s fine, the trouble with that is many people only have code they can’t share
[17:55:18] <gwozniak> When possible (and it usually is)
[17:55:31] <ngoldbaum> and it’s a little presumptuous to assume everyone has public side projects
[17:55:58] <gwozniak> If it's a more senior position and they can't bring some code, we usually aren't too worried about the coding aspect in the first place
[17:58:30] <gwozniak> We tend to probe knowledge of past projects that were mentioned in the resume
[17:59:01] <epilys> I have (diagnosed) ADHD and noise sensitive i.e. I can't concentrate when people are there talking to me. Always did well in technical interviews but they were very challenging and suboptimal

[18:40:41] <gwozniak> In our online interviews we have one person asking a question at a time.  Those who are not the asking the question mute their video (and audio) unless they have a question for the candidate.  This way it reduces the feeling of being watched and hopefully is more calming for the candidate

[20:06:06] <buttsbot> todsacerdoti's submissions | Hacker News
[20:38:36] <gwozniak> Reading a paper that argues "exposing state and making it freely available in your code is good, acutally" and I'm kind of side-eyeing it a lot
[21:03:18] <kronk> it is good. if managed properly.
[21:03:52] <kronk> whether managing it properly is feasible is another story.
[21:04:18] <gwozniak> As always, there is no clear answer
[21:04:40] <gwozniak> But, in general, not exposing it is probably a good idea
[21:04:52] <gwozniak> And in many cases, not necessary
[21:05:34] <gwozniak> Management is typically going to be some kind of API.  If the API is really grotty, then maybe exposing some or all state is good
[21:06:28] <gwozniak> And the examples in the paper can be twisted easily to say that the state that was exposed is actually part of the API
[21:08:17] <gwozniak> I found the framing of the issue in the paper to be more a "preaching to the choir" kind of explanation, too.
[21:08:32] <gwozniak> Still, I got something out of it to think about some more
