[23:37:13] <armin> Voxel: it's called upscaling, yes. might be a bit confusing, since those AI upscalers obviously do a bit more than just increasing the dimensions and antialiasing, but that's the common term.
[23:37:52] <Voxel> Roger that. Thank you!
[23:38:27] <Voxel> I'm currently upscaling and restoring a frame of a movie I like and watched years ago (a 15 year old one ~ 2006)
[23:45:04] <armin> Voxel: what i generally do to increase the quality is actually "downscaling", but that's because i render fractals in very high resolution and later on resize them (scale them down) so they look more crisp.
[23:45:26] *** Joins: Kaylah (~Kaylah@ptr-eit6u3hbfvbbt6to8t5.18120a2.ip6.access.telenet.be)
[23:45:29] <armin> Voxel: so with upscaling, you'd usually lose quality, and that's where these AI upscaling websites will help.
[23:46:23] <Voxel> I redraw it manually basing on the original ^^
[23:46:34] <armin> that sounds difficult. :)
[23:46:46] <Voxel> With love ^^
[23:48:34] <farn> Enhancing is kind of the TV trope for it. https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnhanceButton
[23:48:52] <farn> Though some of the AI services have apparently embraced that. https://letsenhance.io/
[23:49:43] <farn> Then again, "enhancing" would be selling yourself short if you're redrawing the image
