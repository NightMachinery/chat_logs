[01:10:36] <Zipheir> tatsumaru: There's a reason why people in this channel continue to suggest that CS is mathematics.
[01:11:08] <sham1> lambda calculus
[01:11:11] <tatsumaru> yeah I understand that math is fundamental to programming, I just meant if you can use actual math notation as a programming language

[01:12:02] <Zipheir> tatsumaru: Mathematical notation is really hard to parse.
[01:12:06] <sham1> Unless it's APL
[01:12:08] <gwatt> probably. notations are fungible
[01:12:10] <sham1> In which case it's just hard to read
[01:12:48] <gwatt> but what if we used a special, prefix notation for math, with operations enclosed by parentheses?
[01:13:01] <Zipheir> !
[01:13:16] <sham1> That's a neat idea!
[01:13:42] <tatsumaru> this is how I feel when I realize I am dreaming and not actually awake
[01:14:10] <gwatt> well, if you'd had this realization 65+ years ago, you could have invented lisp
[01:14:13] <sham1> But yeah, jokes aside, other than lambda calculi, other mathematical formalisms are difficult to program in. Like you have Turing machines, which theoretically should be easy to program
[01:14:18] <sham1> But… well, not really
[01:15:49] <Zipheir> tatsumaru: Basically, math notation is a natural language, so programming in it means solving a large part of written natural language processing.
[01:16:30] <Zipheir> And it's not nearly as regular as most programming languages.  df/dx looks like a pretty nice rational number, right?
[01:16:37] <tatsumaru> math notation is a natural language? that sounds very contrarian. 
[01:16:48] <Zipheir> Not at all.
[01:16:51] <sham1> And mathematics also have weird ways of doing things. Like for example, infinite summation
[01:17:40] <sham1> $$ \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} 2^{-i} $$ should evaluate to 2, but how would I actually evaluate this
[01:17:41] <tatsumaru> i thought math was the mother of all formal languages
[01:17:58] <tatsumaru> 1 is 1 not ambiguity
[01:18:05] <tatsumaru> s/not/no
[01:18:15] <Zipheir> You seem to be confusing math and a way of writing it.
[01:18:24] <Zipheir> The notation is super ambiguous in many cases.
[01:18:25] <sham1> Sure, but mathematics notation has evolved over centuries and millenia
[01:18:47] <tatsumaru> I might be, how do you call the written form of math?
[01:18:51] <Zipheir> tatsumaru: The study of formal languages didn't really start until the late 19th century.
[01:19:24] <sham1> I mean, APL was an attempt at making an alternative mathematics notation, and… well it certainly succeeded in some sense, but also failed in others
[01:19:37] <gwatt> tatsumaru: I'd probably call it "math", or if I felt formal, "mathematical notation"
[01:19:38] <sham1> Lisp was also basically just Lambda calculus++
[01:19:50] <Zipheir> sham1: Maybe, but that's ahistorical.
[01:20:01] <Zipheir> A popular myth, though!  I repeated it for years.
[01:20:05] <sham1> Oh?
[01:20:27] <gwatt> Mcarthy claimed to not really understand lambda calculus, IIRC. 
[01:20:40] <Zipheir> Yeah, Steele mentions in the λ Papers that it took years for someone to point out to McCarthy that LISP and λ calculus corresponded in some ways.
[01:21:03] <tatsumaru> Wasn't McCarthy a mathematical genius, how could have he not understood lambda
[01:21:44] <sham1> Ah, so Lisp being λ++ was an accident
[01:21:51] <Zipheir> It seems so.
[01:22:01] <Zipheir> In truth, it really didn't happen until Scheme.
[01:22:47] <Zipheir> (I think.  True first-class procedures seem pretty crucial to λ-calculus.)
[01:23:02] <sham1> True, since with Scheme we of course ~~all float~~ care about functional programming at least in some level

[04:31:59] <ASau> Zipheir: I'd like to know, if you've got different opinion that you can back up at least to some extent.
[04:33:58] <ASau> Zipheir: I have not seen proper comparison of performance betweeb all those types of balanced trees (AVL, AA, RB...).
[04:35:26] <ASau> ski: I don't think that real science follows probability theory in its foundations. The core is definitely something non-monotonic.
[04:36:54] <Zipheir> ASau: That's the first I've heard of AA trees.  As you say, I haven't seen a good comparison.  On paper, all those trees have very similar complexity for most operations.
[04:37:28] <ASau> There's such a tricky thing as constant factor.

[04:46:43] <ski> ASau : i think i agree with that (too) (although perhaps you could elaborate)
[04:47:46] <ASau> ski: I'm not sure, if probability theory can be built constructively (i.e. on top of constructive foundations with intuitionistic logic underneath).
[04:48:47] <ASau> ski: yet in any case, at least chemistry and medicine work the way as if they use some kind of default logic.
[04:49:22] <ASau> ski: "if we have not seen it, we consider it impossible"
[04:50:26] <ASau> Actually, if you dig deep enough, you'll see that physics too.
[04:50:57] <ASau> The essence of modern and contemporary foundational physics lies on top of conservation of energy.
[04:52:14] <ASau> To the point that when energy was not conserved during particle collisions, physisists assumed the birth of some particles that took the rest.
[04:53:20] <ASau> If you know how the said conservation of energy was established, you'll see that the whole thing is quite tricky.

[09:19:23] <mdhughes> If I can stick a wire in a computer and get a different result, it's not math, math is just an approximation of what an ideal "computer" would do.
[09:20:36] <mdhughes> edgar-rft: +1
[09:21:48] <mdhughes> Kotlin in theory is closer to the JVM and can be more efficient; Kawa doesn't do TCO by default, and it's slow if you enable it, because that's alien to the JVM.
[09:23:08] <mdhughes> But the virtue of Kawa is it's actually Scheme, and you can move your code to something else with only a little effort. If you stop using Kotlin, you're boned.
[09:28:00] <mdhughes> The weird thing is Kotlin Native. Which tries to translate Java idioms into machine code for various CPUs that aren't anything like the JVM.
[09:37:37] <Zipheir> mdhughes: You can stick a wire in a physics experiment and get a different result, yet I'm sure you'd trust the math regardless.
[09:38:17] <mdhughes> I'd probably be dead and not super interested in math at that point!
[09:38:42] <Zipheir> Maybe there were a bunch of flamboyant claims in the scrollback above, but I just don't understand this anti-math thing.
[09:39:25] <mdhughes> I'm not anti-math, but it's not an accurate description of what we do to these devices.
[09:39:50] <mdhughes> Or at least not what I've ever done. I guess APL? But I can't type it.

[20:52:45] <mdhughes> Except those are so verbose. I got a cunning plan, write a tool that takes a terse textual representation of several formatters, and values, and runs the latter thru the former.
[20:55:50] <Zipheir> The problem with the classic printf/format-style "terse textual representation" is that it's very hard to extend.
[20:56:31] <Zipheir> And magic strings don't compose, whereas formatting combinators do.  But I agree that some tool for compiling format strings to combinators would be a Good Thing.
[20:57:05] <Zipheir> AFAICT there's no reason why you couldn't implement format on top of SRFI 166.
[20:57:37] <sham1> I never liked the CL FORMAT and so I am glad that we're going with combinators. One can always write an implementation of FORMAT on top of the combinators, while the inverse (combinators to format strings) would get irritating
[20:57:49] <gwatt> I mostly want shell/perl style string interpolation
[20:58:12] <Zipheir> jcowan: It looks like you (or whoever is maintaining SRFI 128 these days) may want to change the string-hash implementation: (= (string-hash "cr2") (string-hash "cpt")) ; => #t

[21:03:18] <dpk> Zipheir: keyword-name-comparator may be handy https://gitlab.com/dpk/presrfis/-/blob/master/keyword-arguments/srfi-88.scm
[21:03:46] <dpk> it implements djb2a (with the exception that djb2a is always mod 2**32, whereas this is not)
[21:03:56] <dpk> which is about the best hash function in terms of code simplicity to output quality
[21:05:37] <dpk> oh, also, djb2a originally worked on bytes and this works on characters. i'm not quite sure how severely that affects the output quality
[21:05:50] <dpk> but it doesn't matter for ASCII or mostly-ASCII strings
[21:06:18] <Zipheir> That's cool.
[21:06:28] <Zipheir> Well, I guess that's what SRFI 128 should use instead.
[21:07:10] <sham1> Nah. Let's just go with SipHash
[21:07:42] <dpk> yeah, a serious Scheme implementation should be using a real hash function hardened against the collision-based DoS attacks of recent years
[21:08:15] <dpk> this is a useful hack to somewhat work around the brokenness of SRFI 128's sample implementation in cases where those aren't an issue
[21:12:32] <Zipheir> I am not a huge fan of all this hash black magic, but I've harped on that enough.
[21:13:39] <Zipheir> Not having a Riastradh-level brain means it's all sort of trusting the function to be sufficiently funky.

[21:22:18] <Zipheir> (show #f (numeric/si 3123)) prints 3.1k
[21:23:06] <sham1> Maybe it just rounds with precision 1

[21:23:34] <Zipheir> Specifically, `precision`.

[22:23:49] <dpk> jcowan: also, to let you know in advance, i intend to raise a procedural objection and request a revote on the inclusion of both syntax-case and explicit renaming, on the basis that they should not have been distinct ballot questions, due to the fundamental technical issues involved in making them interoperate (yes, i know it's possible, but involves compromises i think neither party would like to see in their preferred system)
[22:24:43] <dpk> jcowan: (also, the actual appetite for including both systems is seemingly (and understandably) very small — the only reason er has got in is that sc advocates apparently mostly abstained on er rather than voting against)
[22:24:58] <sham1> What I'd do is that I'd make syntax-case mandatory, since it's so similar to the machinery one needs for syntax-rules anyhow, and then make the ER system an optional feature
[22:24:58] <dpk> or seemingly the only reason, anyway
[22:26:29] <sham1> Because I would like to see ER being specced if nothing else. Although with further reflection syntax-case seems like the most logical system to use since it is basically just syntax-rules but better
[22:27:10] <dpk> sham1: that would the situation if there were no er at all in R7RS itself, because explicit renaming is specced (in sc-compatible form, no less) by SRFI 211
[22:27:25] <sham1> Hm

[22:31:03] <dpk> and yes, indeed, i think the reasons people object to syntax-case are mostly historical and political rather than technical
[22:33:22] <sham1> I mean I do understand the objections. syntax-case can be weird to work with, especially if one comes from, say, CL where macros are a lot simpler conceptually, being a function of form datum → datum, whereas with syntax-case one needs to think about templates and identifiers and hygeine and such
[22:33:26] <dpk> the technical issues are: that the expansion algorithm is too complicated compared to explicit renaming or syntactic closures (an issue i consider to be solved by Flatt’s alternative sets of scopes model); that syntax-case is a high-level destructuring system for datums with no low-level primitives (which one can solve with a shim and/or with the R4RS syntax object primitives); that syntax-case, by  taking for itself the convention that its 
[22:33:26] <dpk> transformers are just procedures with no wrapper comparable to {er,sc,rsc}-macro-transformer, tries to establish itself as the One True Macro System to the exclusion of all others

[22:37:07] <sham1> May I ask?
[22:37:40] <dpk> other minor issues are objections to the existence of pattern variables as a third type of lexical binding (after variables and syntax keywords), which i admit is rather excessive for one nifty, essentially internal feature only (the extremely simple implementation of syntax-rules in terms of syntax-case), and think they should have gone with using regular variables and quasisyntax to make it look at least a little more like defmacro, but then 
[22:37:40] <dpk> we're back into politics
