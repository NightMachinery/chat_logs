[00:22:30] <lunaphyte> Azrael_-: at a glance, i don't see anything that appears problematic.  you may need to contact the mail admin for the recipient domain to have them explain why they think there is a problem
[00:23:31] <Azrael_-> how can i find the mail admin of the domain? is it the abuse email in the whois or should i look somewhere else?

[01:13:59] <MrPockets> So I've got a client. They work in an industry where a team of people support a customer through the sales process.   Sales -> Sales engineering -> Consultant works with client, -> up to 3 assistants work with the client throgh the process to assist the client as they work with the consluitant. 
[01:14:33] <MrPockets> My client is looking for a solution, ideally a CRM, but even just an add-on solution, to  allow any one member of the team to pull up the customer and see the history of email correspondence from all the team. 
[01:14:54] <MrPockets> On prem 2013 now, but they're open (and im pushing ) for O365. 
[01:36:47] <rob0> I'd say they might want a ticketing system for that, but direct mails outside it won't be there.
[01:47:51] <MrPockets> I was thinking the same thing. ConnectWise essentially would do that
[01:48:13] <MrPockets> But that'd be a pretty big stretch to adapt it to a sales & service process.

[01:59:08] <rob0> I do tech support, and our sales people use the same ticket system for customer contact.  That basically works.

[02:13:49] <thumbs> MrPockets: ever looked into zendesk?
[02:15:10] <rob0> ha, that's what we use.  I hate it sometimes, but it mostly works.
[02:15:27] <thumbs> it works fine
[02:18:15] <MrPockets> I've not. 
[02:18:20] <MrPockets> Thats more helpdesk than CRM, right?
[02:34:34] <deuxexmachina> Should one expect to be able to easily swap out SMTP relays in this infrastructure?
[02:34:41] <deuxexmachina> Like Sparkpost, SES, Sendgrid, etc?
[02:39:21] <jaybe> what is your question?
[03:01:30] <rob0> easily?  I guess you might have to give them DKIM keys and adjust your SPF as needed.

[04:28:25] <deuxexmachina> rob0: ya no big deal... they seem reasonably easy to switch between - in case you needed to fall back on one from another
