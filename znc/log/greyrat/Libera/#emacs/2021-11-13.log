[03:42:45] <Catie> johnjay: I think the main issue is whether or not the side effect functions really are random, you know? If it's all well-defined and properly documented, it can be fine

[03:46:09] <Catie> Pure functional programming is a beautiful ideal, and can lead to some really cool ideas. But just like every programming paradigm, it can get stifling for certain things. Like avoiding goto in C, there's genuinely some good uses for it, just like there are genuinely good uses for mutable state

[03:48:45] *** Quits: ano (~ano@user/ano) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[03:49:20] <johnjay> basically the guy was arguing that gcc should do "the right thing" even if the standard didn't require it and the maintainer disagreed
[03:49:35] <Catie> I'm inclined to agree with the maintainer in this case
[03:49:36] <laurus> Does anyone know, in org mode publishing, what creates the <nil> tag when published to HTML?
[03:49:48] <johnjay> but yeah obviously the guy was in for a big surprise when he dug into his code and found gcc was optimizing his checks out. XD
[03:50:57] <Catie> I mean that's kind of the point of undefined behavior? The compiler is allowed to do anything, and optimizing an overflow check is very much one of them
[03:52:08] <rk4> that's a curious statement

[03:55:58] <Catie> Hmm, I might be misremembering because of the "nasal demons" story. In this case though, doing anything and assuming undefined behavior doesn't happen can result in the same thing!

[03:58:47] *** Joins: Lord_of_Life (~Lord@user/lord-of-life/x-2819915)
[03:59:45] <rk4> rather than this code checks for integer overflow -> this is UB -> compiler has no rules anymore, and it starts removing arbitrary conditionals
[04:00:17] <Catie> That makes sense, and I'd think any rational compiler would operate that way. I just don't think they're required to by the standard
[04:00:56] <Catie> Like if I did "char *x = NULL; x = 3;", it would probably still compile, but it's trivially easy to see that it invokes undefined behavior
[04:01:31] <rk4> one supposes these positions converge as optimizing compilers become ever more advanced!
[04:01:51] <Catie> I sure hope so
[04:02:56] * rk4 sidesteps the problem by having crabs, or gophers, but the latter still has UB occasionally

[05:21:53] <drdo> Is it possible to pin package versions?
[05:22:46] <pjb> grym: how can /usr/bin/env be more guaranteed than /bin/sh ?
[05:23:31] <pjb> grym: the real solution is to "install" your script, updating the path of the editor then.
[05:24:03] <grym> pjb: ornxka addressed that already 
[05:24:18] <grym> but i don't see where editors come into it at all 
[05:24:56] *** Joins: countvajhula (~user@192-184-202-231.fiber.dynamic.sonic.net)
[05:25:21] <pjb> grym: about sh, but my point is to use this installation phase for the other interpreters.  I dislike /usr/bin/env foo a lot.
[05:25:38] <grym> "installation phase"? 
[05:25:59] <grym> if you're going to shebang a python script you really do want to use env to do it, which in part is why you shouldn't :) 
[05:26:10] <pjb> :-)
[05:26:15] *** Joins: notzmv (~zmv@user/notzmv)
[05:26:17] <grym> so i'm in the habit of telling people who insist on shebanging to use env 
[05:26:22] <grym> (as i live in python a lot)
[05:26:32] <pjb> I try to avoid it almost as much as perl.
[05:26:45] <pjb> ruby is way better than python, as a language.
[05:27:08] <grym> i know exactly as much ruby as required to, uh, occasionally kick my github page over 
[05:27:39] <grym> ruby has zero traction in my world 
[05:27:48] <grym> so i can't really say much abou tit 
[05:28:08] <pjb> I don't let myself be tracted by language. I tract them!
[05:30:00] <grym> a trivial google suggests that https://github.com/ruby-numo/numo-linalg  is as good as it gets, and that looks like pretty small beer to me

[05:50:28] <pjb> johnjay: it's easy: python distinguishes statements from expressions, and has significant spaces (bad and bad), while ruby has only expressions, is basically a mmatzacred lisp (good and bad, but good enough).
[05:51:54] <pjb> of course, emacs lisp is way superior to both, so indeed a good choice to use in unix scripts: but #!/usr/bin/emacs doesn't work out of the box. you need a little utility to make it easy, or use a trampline.

[07:42:37] <grym> the pronounciation's different 
[07:42:59] <aidalgol> Well I usually just see it typed when coming from elsewhere.

[08:32:50] <rudybot> bpalmer: I can't get into it without spoilers, but I thought the film basically had no center at all. It starts off feeling like a mood piece about the effects of isolation under stress on a small group of people, and ends up as... something very much else. I thought the "something else" was very, very lazy.

[13:40:10] <thblt> Anyone knows tab-bar-mode? Someone here reported a bug yesterday: when you delete a buffer, an inactive tab that was showing that buffer keeps that buffer's name as its name until it's selected again. I'm trying to patch this, but I can't find the update function that gets called when a tab is selected.

[19:28:38] <wasamasa> contrapunctus: skewer-mode, many years ago
[19:28:46] <wasamasa> contrapunctus: but I usually just press F5, lol
[19:29:25] <johnjay> wasamasa: you're familiar with nxml-mode right
[19:29:34] <wasamasa> somewhat
[19:29:40] <johnjay> is there a fairly standardized way to convert xml <-> sexp
[19:29:45] <johnjay> or is it a big hairy mess
[19:30:13] <wasamasa> there's xml.el which is kind of icky to work with
[19:30:19] <wasamasa> and there's esxml which is cool to work with
[19:31:00] <johnjay> i find it funny package-install simply installs the package without asking for confirmation. but at least i know it's in melpa now
[19:31:34] <wasamasa> esxml takes what libxml-parse-region produces
[19:31:39] <wasamasa> which is nicknamed esxml
[19:31:46] <wasamasa> and is different from the xml.el output
[19:32:17] <johnjay> This file contains a somewhat incomplete non-validating XML parser.  It ;; parses a file, and returns a list that can be used internally by ;; any other Lisp libraries.
[19:32:34] <johnjay> ah so it builds on xml.el instead of reinventing it
[19:32:37] <wasamasa> no
[19:32:41] <wasamasa> it's its own thing
[19:32:48] *** Joins: ferdy (~ferdy@93.51.79.125)
[19:32:59] <wasamasa> I contributed a bunch of stuff to it, then a XML querying thing and then everyone liked it
[19:33:07] <johnjay> it has (require 'xml) at the top
[19:33:49] <wasamasa> hm
[19:34:03] <johnjay> also i just realize i forgot i set ns-function-modifier to 'hyper
[19:34:09] <wasamasa> oh wait
[19:34:12] <wasamasa> I think I added that
[19:34:19] <johnjay> so i technically have hyper on mac now. i just need to figure out how to do it on windows and gnu/leenyux
[19:35:07] <wasamasa> no, I didn't
[19:35:22] <wasamasa> but I added entity encoding using a helper from xml.el
[19:35:24] <wasamasa> funny
[19:35:45] <wasamasa> yeah, that's all it uses from xml.el
[19:35:49] <wasamasa> everything else is reinvented
[19:35:50] <johnjay> why would pcase instead of destructuring bind lead to harder to debug cod
[19:35:52] <johnjay> e
[19:35:53] <gnoo> johnjay: setxkbmap -option ctrl:swapcaps_hyper
[19:35:58] <gnoo> if using xorg
[19:36:27] <gnoo> remaps caps lock to control and left control to hyper
[19:36:28] <johnjay> does that still work in terminal?
[19:36:35] <gnoo> i think so
[19:36:41] <wasamasa> pcase expands to wilder code I guess
[19:36:47] <johnjay> hrm. i'm not sure how to get hyper in terminal. hyperterminal
[19:36:50] <gnoo> johnjay: not in a tty tho
[19:37:22] <johnjay> right. that's what i mean. that's the other reason i haven't used hyper much
[19:37:34] <johnjay> i get concerned when things don't translate between terminal and gui seamlessly
[19:37:57] <johnjay> probably impossible? not sure
[19:38:33] <gnoo> johnjay: by terminal you mean something like xterm, st, urxvt or the one you get with C-M-F2, C-M-F3, etc
[19:39:05] <gnoo> it works on the former
[19:39:07] <johnjay> um. i guess

[23:00:12] <icmor> describe-bindings' help buffer is now shown in outline-mode by default (Emacs 29), which I think should be the default for describe-mode as well as it makes it a lot easier to navigate
[23:00:28] <pjb> johnjay: yes, that's why you'd rather use lisp than ruby. But if you're lost on an island with a computer that has only python or ruby, you'd prefer to start from ruby to write your lisp.
