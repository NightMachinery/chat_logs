[04:54:14] <Corbin> How do I portably walk a result? I have a program in CHICKEN and I want to walk it to change "_0" to "X", "_1" to "Y", etc.
[04:55:52] <Corbin> Oh, there's undocumented reify helpers in the CHICKEN version, at least. I can probably figure something out with those.
[05:07:58] <Corbin> Hm. And I guess that this version isn't parameterized enough for this. Oh well. Back to the drawing board.
