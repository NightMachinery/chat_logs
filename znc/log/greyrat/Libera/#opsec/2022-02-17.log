[00:02:52] <jan6> VLC can play youtube, as can MPV
[00:03:21] <jan6> might need youtube-dl or yt-dlp 
[00:03:34] <Bitweasil> If I cared that much, I would fix the problems.  But I don't.  I find almost everything linked on YouTube to be a shitty, high bandwidth version of what would make a very nice blog post or few.
[00:03:57] <Zwolf12> i'll have to side with Bitweasil on that 
[00:04:15] <Zwolf12> text is ... more efficient most of the time
[00:05:02] <Zwolf12> plus nos canvasing 
[00:05:13] <Bitweasil> I don't care about how the person presenting the ideas looks, or if they can make "amazing YouTube orgasm faces" or whatever they call that crap for thumbnails.  "OH NO I ALMOST BLEW MYSELF UP MAKING BROCCOLI WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?????????"
[00:05:25] <Bitweasil> I would far rather address the ideas presented directly.
[00:05:35] <Bitweasil> And video is *horrid* at conveying anything of substance.
[00:05:42] <Zwolf12> ^
[00:05:54] <Zwolf12> except some documentaries 
[00:06:00] <Zwolf12> dense stuff
[00:06:17] <Bitweasil> I've told people, and stand by, that if you want me to learn about something, offer me three books on the matter.  I would literally rather read three books to get a feel for an area than watch a couple hours of YouTube, which means I won't actually know enough to know if the presenters are full of crap or not.
[00:07:34] <Bitweasil> I'm not opposed to video.  I enjoy a good movie, and there certainly are some styles that are best suited to video.
[00:07:42] <Bitweasil> The other 99.995% of content on YouTube, though...
[00:10:20] *** Joins: chuck48 (~chuck48@2a03:1b20:9:f011::a04d)
[00:11:45] <jan6> also also there's invidious, instead of youtube ;P
[00:12:54] <jan6> 90% of content on youtube barely anyone ever sees
[00:13:02] <Bitweasil> If it's video, I think I've made my point clear enough.
[00:13:04] <jan6> so that's not even a good point, lol
[00:13:55] <jan6> I'd also argue that probably like half of books, if not more, are also trash
[00:14:10] <Zwolf12> this is getting nowhere 
[00:14:29] <Bitweasil> Sure.  Go with 90% of them.  That's still *radically* better than high bandwidth video with a side helping of surveillance capitalism behavioral extraction.
[00:14:38] <Bitweasil> My books aren't generally going to be reporting up how long I spent on each page.
[00:17:33] <Zwolf12> behavioral analysis is madness
[00:17:58] <Zwolf12> so efficient

[00:24:30] <jan6> you can just use yt-dlp to download, or stream, say, 480p version of the video, with no tracking other than "this IP accessed this video", and same for all the other ways
[00:24:42] <jan6> but sure, you can avoid 'em if you want
[00:27:44] <Bitweasil> I can avoid the tracking if I care, I can't avoid the fact that most of the videos are absolute shit, written to an audience that I am not.
[00:30:41] <jan6> same for most of everything
[00:31:28] <jan6> most programs, most chatrooms, most books, etc etc
[00:31:53] <Bitweasil> Yes, but the crap-to-signal ratio on YouTube in particular is so high it's not even worth the hassle to work out ways to view it.
[00:32:00] <Bitweasil> Most of my computing is broken.
[00:32:01] <Bitweasil> I know this.
[00:32:16] <Bitweasil> I try to avoid x86 and Intel where I can, though I have a few because, unfortunately, there are people in my family other than me.
[00:36:55] <Zwolf12> idk
[00:37:01] <Zwolf12> i think it's just habit
[00:37:10] <Zwolf12> when i study i read
[00:37:15] <Zwolf12> when i relax i watch
[00:38:03] <Zwolf12> except documentaries n conferences
[00:38:19] <Zwolf12> then i learn too

[02:41:10] <Joanna> Bitweasil: Zwolf12 I was reading previous conversation and I prefer podcasts. It seems like a lot of videos just have someone yapping with a bunch of visuals that don’t really give much information. It depends upon who is making the video or podcast of course but there seems to be a phenomenon of people of people who don’t have much of anything interesting to say managing to talk a lot without saying anything and then trying to 
[02:41:10] <Joanna> make money from advertising.
[02:41:56] <Joanna> The Corbett report has blogs for people who prefer reading I believe.
[02:46:06] <Bitweasil> That's a pretty good description of YouTube, certainly.
[02:46:16] <Bitweasil> I tend to put long form stuff in Pocket and then chew it on my Kobo.
[02:48:56] <jan6> depends, often the visuals do help, but aren't critical
[02:49:11] <jan6> and other times they're important only at a few small parts
[02:50:08] <jan6> that's of course assuming informational content
[02:50:40] <Bitweasil> *shrug*  Again, I'd rather read books.  I look forward to some point in my life when I can shut off a computer for the last time.
[02:50:40] <Joanna> I wish there was a way to filter out all videos with advertisements
[02:51:01] <Bitweasil> Joanna, just nullroute YouTube in your /etc/hosts, problem solved. ;)
[02:51:10] <jan6> just use adblock, easy
[02:51:25] <Bitweasil> Doesn't help against sponsored crap in the middle of videos.
[02:51:25] <jan6> and for sponsor segments, sponsorblock is a thing, although community-run so not perfect
[02:52:04] <jan6> given it's community-run, it basically just works by someone watching the video, and marking up where the segment is, and everyone else can just skip it after that
[02:52:14] <jan6> whereas ads can be autoblocked
[02:52:14] <Bitweasil> "And now, for a word from our sponsors, UltraSecretSuperPrivateSafeMegaVPN, your kinks are safe with us!  Unless the government comes knocking, we do log... and provide data to government if they ask, or if we think you're up to no good.  Only $55.59/month!  Use this link, mash subscribe, like me, yell it from the rooftops, I Subscribed!"
[02:52:23] <Joanna> There are a small number of things there that are useful mixed in with the garbage such as how to knit which really does need a video
[02:52:39] <jan6> instructional stuff usually is much better with video
[02:52:47] <jan6> or at least illustrations
[02:53:41] <jan6> even tech tutorials, are better as either (hyper)text, or video, than pure audio
[02:53:55] <jan6> to be fair, often blogs are much better than videos
[02:54:00] <jan6> but not as easy to find
[02:54:08] <Joanna> There is a simple way to know if an entity is collecting info for government. If it mentions “privacy” it’s definitely a snitch
[02:54:29] <jan6> uh, no
[02:54:37] <jan6> if it DOESN'T mention privacy, it is
[02:55:29] <Bitweasil> You're both right.  If it's on the internet, it probably is.
[02:55:32] <Bitweasil> Directly or indirectly.
[02:55:50] <jan6> your privacy policy can be as short as "we use a single cookie to log you in, and nothing else is logged for longer than an hour", but if there's none, then that's real bad
[02:56:15] <jan6> and you literally CANNOT operate in a way that you don't collect any info
[02:57:16] <Joanna> Government created internet. In the days before internet if you had a question you would ask someone you know or go look it up at a library. Now you send questions through the internet and give lots of people permanent copies.
[02:57:24] <jan6> you can do your best to minimize it, but if you attempt to never store anything, and nullroute all logs, then that just opens you up for abuse which you can't block, since you'd need a bit of logs to even detect it's coming from the same IP, or whatnot
[02:57:40] <Bitweasil> CloudFlare solves a lot. :/
[02:57:42] <Bitweasil> I'm not logging, they are.
[02:57:47] <jan6> in the days before internet you just used dialup BBSs
[02:57:50] <jan6> basically same thing
[02:57:51] <jan6> lol
[02:58:14] <Joanna> Convenience comes at a cost. I can’t deny that google maps is amazing
[02:58:25] <jan6> cloudflare is useful *ONLY* if you genuinely get MASSIVE attacks on your site
[02:58:56] <Joanna> Can you imagine being able to have a street view of faraway places before internet...
[02:58:57] <jan6> since there's only so much you can do with a single physical machine, to keep it free of attacks/spam and also operating normally
[02:59:05] <jan6> yes, it's called photos, Joanna 
[02:59:47] <jan6> it wouldn't be a complete dome view, and you can't move around, but it's enough, generally
[03:00:42] <Joanna> As the unabomber manifesto said you can’t separate good technology from bad technology. You get it all in a package deal.
[03:00:59] <jan6> and panoramas have also been technically a thing for a while (just prohibitatively expensive in analogue form, to take them of non-significant places)
[03:01:09] <jan6> you can separate it
[03:01:13] <jan6> but it constantly changes
[03:01:22] <jan6> what was good yesterday might not be good tomorrow
[03:02:02] <jan6> what was the worst thing ever yesteryear might become totally good compared to everything else, next year
[03:03:09] <jan6> also panoramic film cameras did totally exist
