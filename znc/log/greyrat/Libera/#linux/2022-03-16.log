[02:40:34] <bitskit> So I'm curious if anyone knows how to fix this. Maybe a special setting you have to add to a dotfile somewhere.

For better or worse though, /home is an NFS mounted on servers running different distros (at least they're all RHEL/CentOS 6/7 variants). While I can do hostname-aware checks before adding to the various paths, where should I store the libraries and binaries? Should I make distro-specific .local directories in my home

[06:39:44] <kuz3> it no work

[07:35:43] <parabyte> bindi, i highly recommend this method
[07:35:54] <parabyte> you need at least 2tb of free space to capture the data
[07:36:09] <parabyte> for a typical vhs movie im using approx 300-400gigs of space

[07:36:18] <bindi> i have a nooelec

[07:36:41] *** ackroydai is now known as saphyra
[07:36:45] <bindi> hmm that's way more bandwidth

[12:18:34] <katp32> my main issue is that a large portion of the system is on a read-only filesystem, including /etc/passwd, but I also need the user to be able to add their own users
[12:19:05] <jim> there could be approaches that haven't really been applied to the vast majority of linux/unix installations, but I'm not aware of them
[12:19:11] <katp32> that, and package management, although that's somewhat less of an issue as I could plausibly just write a hardcoded /etc/passwd file with all UIDs, which would probably be better anyways
[12:19:41] <katp32> pam can surely do this, pam can let you use an LDAP database or all sorts of stuff for users, so I'm sure it can read passwd files..

[22:53:43] <blei86> Can you query the running kernel to see which capabilities it provides

[22:54:16] <kfrench> mizu_: #linux-offtopic
[22:54:38] <ayecee> there is a kernel compile option that provides a /proc/config.gz that has that information. otherwise, no, you'd have to get it from the matching config file usually stored in /boot.
[22:54:41] <kfrench> blei86: Sometimes there is a /proc/config.gz.  More generally, the config is kept in /boot/ right next to the kernel.
[22:54:53] <blei86> but can you query the kernel
[22:54:58] <ayecee> no
[22:55:05] <kfrench> /proc/config.gz would be querying the kernel

[22:56:48] <ayecee> for some subset of capabilities, maybe

[23:48:45] <jensen> what makes emacs inherently "slow" i love org-mode and people say magit is amazing, but i need vim modal editing. in the future, i want to use either as an IDE as well. Having hard time deciding between emacs (evil plugin) or nvim, both elisp and lua seem extensible. I don't want to make emacs "do everything", i tend to favor the best tool for the job. I'm not aware of any comparable alternative to
[23:48:47] <jensen> org-mode for nvim (i don't mean merely folding headlines, but being able to search for notes (string) in organized structure (layers of headlines). Searching on a line basis is inadequate

[23:59:12] <ananke> asking what 'sysadmins' do is like asking how cooks cook, largely irrelevant and more often kitchen dependent.
[23:59:38] <ayecee> there's a few that avoid all updates until they absolutely have to apply them, and by then they're so far behind and there's so many updates to do that it's virtually guaranteed to break something.
[23:59:58] <ayecee> if they haven't been broken first by unpatched vulnerabilities.
