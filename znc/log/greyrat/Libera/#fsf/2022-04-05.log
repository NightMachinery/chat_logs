[00:11:19] <qrpnxz> mediawiki is wiki software, not for writing documents. I suppose the web articles are technically documents, but it's just so separated from the purpose of latex it's completely apples and oranges

[00:11:50] <kompowiec2> mediawiki mainly differs from latex for me in that latex allows you to freely manipulate the appearance, which in mediawiki I do not have to worry about.
[00:12:18] <zleap> so each has a use 
[00:12:30] <zleap> it is about knowing when to use different tools

[03:08:53] <belgin> Maximalist: the license is important to determine whether a program is free or not. The MIT licenses are a family of freedom-respecting, but pushover ("permissive") licenses, meaning someone can release changes to the code under a proprietary license
[03:09:43] <DiffieHellman> Maximalist: Btw, MIT has many licenses, so the FSF generally calls it the expat license. Expat is a pushover free software license, and a program is free software as long as it's applied to the source code (and not just the binary - in that case such binary would not be free software, but at least reverse engineering isn't illegal). 
[03:10:29] <DiffieHellman> *won't be illegal and permitted by then license
[03:12:55] <DiffieHellman> The expat license doesn't cover software patents though. You can take some source under expat, modify it to add a patented feature and then proceed to sue anyone who distributes the source or a binary containing something that you feel like violates your patent. For this reason, Apache 2.0 is reccommended over expat, as it has similar patent grants to the GPLv3.

[07:57:55] <epony> the real concerns are "hardware interface" and "software protocol" rather than "file system" and "management screens"
[07:58:43] <tpefreedom> wdym by hardware interface?
[07:58:46] <epony> if you pick long term reliable standards interfaces like Ethernet, and TCP/IP and file transfer protocols.. you can't go wrong
[08:00:53] <epony> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_transfer_protocols#Protocols_for_packet-switched_networks
[08:01:12] <jxself> DECnet!
[08:02:10] <epony> reliable ones are SSH (and related) / RSYNC / FTP / HTTP and to some extent NFS and SMB
[08:02:14] <jxself> NCP!
[08:04:29] <epony> most of these are available on any FSF approved GNU with Linux distribution (and also on less approved Linux and BSD systems)
[08:05:30] <epony> what particular file system features these have, depends on the OS kernel and its file system support (and the software extending it as userland tools)
[08:06:15] <epony> definitely is not the decisive point (the file system type) unless you plan to move the drives as objects between machines with other software setup

[08:15:16] <epony> it is also meaningful to combine multiple roles on a reasonbly sized machine for a local workgroup, an email service system can coexist on a file services system nicely in that regard

[12:45:19] <kompowiec2> I was referring to it
[12:45:49] <potatoxel[m]> yes but thats refering to the freedom to modify a program
[12:45:49] <potatoxel[m]> not the fact that i will
[12:46:02] <potatoxel[m]> rust's trademark policy says:
[12:46:02] <potatoxel[m]> Distributing a modified version of the Rust programming language or the Cargo package manager and calling it Rust or Cargo requires explicit, written permission from the Rust core team. We will usually allow these uses as long as the modifications are (1) relatively small and (2) very clearly communicated to end-users.
[12:46:51] <kompowiec2> so the matter is simple, we either rebrand or do not use rust. I don't see a third option here.
[12:47:22] <potatoxel[m]> yes so my question was whats the progress on that issue
[12:47:40] <potatoxel[m]> is the rust foundation gonna try to make it easier to rebrand
[12:47:59] <potatoxel[m]> or change their trademark policy

[13:02:40] <qrpnxz> point of trademark is not misrepresent origin, and that's pretty much all they are asking. Can't really complain
[13:03:05] <potatoxel[m]> qrpnxz: yes but the main issue is difficulity of rebranding
[13:03:22] <potatoxel[m]> thats what i read some peopel complain about

[13:04:06] <qrpnxz> you know, you don't even have to do it if you use it personally, or probably even if you hand it to a friend. You just can't have it out on public saying "this is Rust". Cause it isn't.

[13:45:32] <qrpnxz> It forces you to share and I can't think of any way that is acceptable.
[13:46:01] <qrpnxz> it's basically a royalty paid in patches for the ability to run modified versions. Freedom 0 blown the fuck out
[13:46:10] <DiffieHellman> Provided you don't actually modify the hosting software, you don't even have to mention that you use AGPLv3 licensed software for hosting.
[13:46:12] <potatoxel[m]> i think copyright is eh
[13:46:36] <DiffieHellman> It takes no effort at all to link to your source code on your website.

[13:47:33] <qrpnxz> DiffieHellman, "just don't do this" is exactly the problem. I want my freedom so I'm not gonna use it. Even if it took no effort (though that is debatable because i still find the conditions under which it triggers and modification obligations very not clear) i don't want it
[13:47:57] <potatoxel[m]> if someone downloads the binary they need to be able to get the source code too
[13:48:00] <potatoxel[m]> vs
[13:48:01] <qrpnxz> potatoxel[m], GPL doesn't force you to share. I doesn't try to do any tomfoolery with freedom 0 either

[13:48:37] <DiffieHellman> Having to have your changes on the same site is not a freedom 0 violation as it is no real trouble to do.
[13:48:43] <qrpnxz> i don't want to make sass, agpl doesn't even address sass, nor is that its purpose. rms has said that both online and personally to me
[13:48:57] <potatoxel[m]> it doesnt address sass yes
[13:49:45] <DiffieHellman> Yup, all it does is prevent you from witholding your changes if you do distribute the program via a network service.
[13:50:14] <qrpnxz> wrong, there's no distribution
[13:50:22] <qrpnxz> use is not distribution
[13:50:26] <DiffieHellman> If you don't distribute the programs control via a network service, then you don't need to do anything.
[13:50:35] <qrpnxz> not as a special license term, not in reality either.
[13:51:15] <potatoxel[m]> well i currently still license my stuff under agpl
[13:51:19] <qrpnxz> DiffieHellman, do you not realize that is not freedom. You can't just say "just don't do X". I wanna be able to do X in freedom!
[13:51:33] <potatoxel[m]> but my overall idea is copyright makes not much sense
[13:51:48] <DiffieHellman> qrpnxz: You want to control users in freedom?
[13:52:17] <qrpnxz> agpl has nothing to do with user control. A service is inherently not in your control. Giving you the source does not give you control over the service.
[13:52:24] <DiffieHellman> potatoxel[m]: Even so, we shall weild it as a weapon to ensure freedom rather than to restrict ot
[13:52:25] <potatoxel[m]> the idea of the gnu licenses is, do what u want except restricting others.
[13:52:27] <DiffieHellman> *it.
[13:52:30] <potatoxel[m]> qrpnxz: it lets you self host it
[13:53:06] <potatoxel[m]> DiffieHellman: i mean so long as its there id prob use the copyleft licenses
[13:53:14] <qrpnxz> actually no. The whole app may depend on several services, some of which may be agpl, some not. AGPL doesn't require configuration either. Again, agpl does not and is not meant to solve sass
[13:53:16] <DiffieHellman> Just don't share such thing over a network if you really don't want to share your changes.
[13:53:42] <qrpnxz> "just don't do what you want to do" -- non-free license
[13:54:18] <DiffieHellman> "Don't restrict users in that particular way" == nonfree license???
[13:54:37] <qrpnxz> agpl doesn't free users and it's not meant to
[13:54:48] <qrpnxz> it's purpose is simply get patches back
[13:54:52] <qrpnxz> that's it
[13:55:00] <qrpnxz> but it does it in a way that has no ethical backing
[13:55:05] <qrpnxz> so it should not exist
[13:55:32] <DiffieHellman> Even it that was just it, that doesn't matter, as providing changes is not really a hard thing at all.
[13:55:57] <qrpnxz> even if it was easy, which it is not, I don't want to comply. I want to assert my freedom.
[13:56:08] <DiffieHellman> The AGPLv3 doesn't require that you provide changes back to the original developers, just the users of the site anyway.
[13:56:19] <qrpnxz> correct
[13:56:32] <Andrew> qrpnxz: No AGPL?  Can't use my programs, haha
[13:56:37] <DiffieHellman> That's proprietary software developer logic.
[13:56:44] <qrpnxz> Andrew, i can't use a lot of proprietary programs so
[13:57:42] <kompowiec2> it's ridiculous that any criticism of the GPL is due to a misunderstanding of it.
[13:58:13] <Andrew> So I make some sort of Internet Delay Chat server
[13:58:20] <DiffieHellman> `tar cf source.tar source/ && rsync source.tar /var/www/xd/` - wow complying with the AGPLv3 is hard.
[13:58:24] <qrpnxz> i have almost no problem with GPL. GPL I approve
[13:58:53] <potatoxel[m]> DiffieHellman: qrpnxz isnt saying that
[13:58:59] <Andrew> And google decides to take its code because it's a good protocol
[13:59:01] <Andrew> And they remove all the federation parts from my code and make it their new SaaSS
[13:59:03] <Andrew> Fun
[13:59:05] <Andrew> The AGPL doesn't allow that
[13:59:25] <potatoxel[m]> ?
[13:59:25] <potatoxel[m]> no it does?
[13:59:33] <qrpnxz> this just in: agpl sass is still sass and you still shouldn't use it
[13:59:37] <potatoxel[m]> AGPL doesnt prevent SASS
[13:59:48] <DiffieHellman> It does allow that, but google must provide the modified source to all users.
[13:59:53] <Andrew> I know it doesn't prevent SaaSS
[13:59:55] <Andrew> Exactly, as DiffieHellman says
[14:00:12] <Andrew> (Even though in my case "Google"'s modifications are stupid)
[14:01:21] <Andrew> i.e. removing the s2s protocol

[14:04:30] <potatoxel[m]> node defionitions arent code
[14:04:36] <potatoxel[m]> they are just data
[14:04:40] <Andrew> ok
[14:04:50] <potatoxel[m]> like html and css
[14:04:59] <Andrew> Anyways, DiffieHellman: If software copyright ceases to exist, and all software becomes basically public domain, would you like that?
[14:05:09] <potatoxel[m]> they will eventually add sever sent client side lua code
[14:05:11] <Andrew> I personally don't, because then nothing tells redistributors to give the source
[14:05:18] <Andrew> potatoxel[m]: sscsm exists already
[14:05:26] <qrpnxz> if that happen i want a law that says programs must be distrib with corresponding source
[14:05:27] <potatoxel[m]> does it?
[14:06:10] <DiffieHellman> What about turing complete HTML5+CSS?
[14:06:16] <Andrew> DiffieHellman: Dumb

[14:06:41] <Andrew> potatoxel[m]: it's a client mod that runs server-sent client code sandboxed
[14:06:48] <DiffieHellman> Andrew: No, as that won't put an end to proprietary software. Even if a binary is public domain, that doesn't make it free sotfware/
[14:06:53] <Andrew> Note: TeX is turing complete, you should write your programs in in TeX when possible and use \ShellEscape for syscalls
[14:06:57] <Andrew> DiffieHellman: Exactly!
[14:07:04] <Andrew> 17:35 <qrpnxz> if that happen i want a law that says programs must be distrib with corresponding source This is nice
[14:07:11] <potatoxel[m]> Andrew: ok but is it in the official cliet
[14:07:25] <potatoxel[m]> i.e if i dont donwload it manually do i have it already
[14:07:29] <DiffieHellman> All that will happen is proprietary softare programmers will just take source code and turn it into proprietary software.
[14:07:48] <qrpnxz> hell, i want that law now, copyright or not.
[14:07:51] <potatoxel[m]> DiffieHellman: but there wont be issues with breaking drm being illegal
[14:08:13] <DiffieHellman> But you don't want the same when it comes to a web service with users?
[14:08:25] <potatoxel[m]> or code leaks from companies being illegal to use
[14:08:51] <DiffieHellman> Source code leaks could be covered by "trade secret" laws, so still illegal to use.
[14:09:10] <potatoxel[m]> hm
[14:09:25] <potatoxel[m]> ur a trade secret
[14:09:28] <Andrew> "Trade secret laws", silly stuff we're dealing with
[14:09:30] <qrpnxz> a service is a private person doing private things. I just communicate with them. The logic of Affero (a commercial enterprise) is that they are into Open Source. They are like Linus Torvalds. They are just in it for the patches. And we decided to do the AGPL experiment, and i think it's time to retire it. It's just bad.
[14:09:41] <DiffieHellman> There is a bunch of firmware released in binary-only form under a BSD license, but pretty much nobody actually reverse engineers such binaries and creates free software replacements.
[14:10:27] <potatoxel[m]> lol only binary
[14:10:32] <potatoxel[m]> but its bsd
[14:10:55] <DiffieHellman> potatoxel[m]: Ah yeah, btw, the DMCA's anti-circumvention clause would still apply even if the software was public domain.

[14:11:27] <DiffieHellman> is
[14:11:42] <potatoxel[m]> hm
[14:12:16] <qrpnxz> imagine you run a restaurant, and you buy a recipe book. But you have an allergy so you change one of the recipe. Then you find out you have to offer every customer your recipe because of the *copyright of the book*. Like, how is something like that even legal. Is that legal in the US? If so, proprietary companies have even more power than i imagine.

[14:22:16] <potatoxel[m]> later
[14:22:19] <potatoxel[m]> imma stare at a wall now
[14:24:27] <littlebobeep> qrpnxz: What are you objections to AGPL I was disconnected and missed most of it...?
[14:24:35] <qrpnxz> anyway, getting source for a copy of a program is basically right to repair, the fact that a patch could end up upstream is just a side-effect. For AGPL that is the express purpose of the clause, it doesn't have an underlying sounds motive to do what it does other than that. It can't. It's not a personal copy running on personal hardware. It owes you nothing. Same way some other non-software service provider owes you no information about their methods.
[14:25:32] <qrpnxz> littlebobeep, basically, the AGPL has no ethical basis to do what it does. You should be able to not share, but AGPL says no, pay up code royalty or your license to run modified copy is revoked.
[14:25:42] <DiffieHellman> Upstream doesn't need to get the source under AGPLv3 unless upstream is a user.
[14:25:53] <qrpnxz> i know
[14:26:05] <qrpnxz> here lies the difference between tactic and strategy
[14:26:11] <DiffieHellman> Then why do you claim that it's all about upstream getting source?
[14:26:40] <qrpnxz> because the official material around the license, the historical context, and stallman himself says it is
[14:27:34] <potatoxel[m]> hmm
[14:27:34] <kilobug> qrpnxz: the ethical consideration about AGPL is because you should remain in control of your data; since it's your data are provided to the external service, you should always know what is done with them (hence access to the source code) and have the right to get move back your data home (or to another provider), hence why you should be allowed to run the code that process them

[14:28:17] <potatoxel[m]> ok you should be able to know but even with agplv3 u cant
[14:28:18] <qrpnxz> the only way to remain in control is to not use sass. AGPL doesn't solve sass, it doesn't claim to solve sass, AGPL sass is still sass and you still shouldn't use it
[14:28:19] <kilobug> qrpnxz: without AGPL, it's very easy to be "locked in" your provider (AGPL isn't enough to completely prevent lock-in, but it does contribute in making it much harder)
[14:28:32] <potatoxel[m]> there could be an external program monitoring the agplv3 program
[14:28:52] <qrpnxz> AGPL doesn't let you know what happen to your data either. I can just copy whatever you send me and send it both to AGPL service and my evil service.
[14:29:02] <qrpnxz> it doesn't guarantee data migration either
[14:29:05] <qrpnxz> totally orthogonal issue
[14:29:40] *** Joins: fling (~fling@user/fling)
[14:29:41] <DiffieHellman> Well, if you read the source, you can see what's happening to your data.
[14:29:49] <kilobug> it's not a _sufficient_ condition but it's a _necessary_ one
[14:29:55] <qrpnxz> you can see one thing that is happening
[14:30:01] <qrpnxz> not everything
[14:30:58] <qrpnxz> but anyway, that is again not the aim of the AGPL, and if it were it totally fails
[14:31:02] <littlebobeep> qrpnxz: I don't know it seems expanding the definition/scope of conveyance to software accessed over a network, from a user's standpoint this is net positive for accessing code and spinning up a similar service/node, it helps decentralization and autonomy and awareness of the service you are using via a network...
[14:31:59] <qrpnxz> like i mentioned before, I'm not claiming sharing is bad. Sharing is good. If the provider decided to share with you the source, that would be without a doubt good. But just because doing something is good, doesn't mean forcing people to do that thing is good.
[14:32:23] <littlebobeep> qrpnxz: You are making an arguement against copyleft itself, here...
[14:32:28] <qrpnxz> not so
[14:32:36] <qrpnxz> GPL is well justified
[14:32:45] <littlebobeep> I see only net social harm in copyleft, likewise extending it to networked services
[14:32:59] <littlebobeep> *net social good (wow no edit feature)
[14:33:01] <qrpnxz> it's source availability if they decide to share the program with you. For your private copy to run privately, on your private hardware
[14:33:25] <qrpnxz> getting to look into someone's closet is a whole different thing
[14:33:30] <potatoxel[m]> littlebobeep: lol
[14:33:56] <littlebobeep> potatoxel[m]: Do you have edit feature in your client, seems you evolved beyond IRC
[14:34:09] <kilobug> qrpnxz: again, having the source code available is a necessary condition to avoid vendor lock-in, so you retain your ability to switch provider; it's not a sufficient condition (you still need some mechanism to be able to export the data in a convenient format) but it's definitely a necessary one
[14:34:30] <potatoxel[m]> yes but i dont think it does what  i think it does
[14:34:33] <potatoxel[m]> * it does (TEST)
[14:34:35] <qrpnxz> i don't think it's necessary nor adequate
[14:34:40] <kilobug> qrpnxz: nothing to do with "getting to look into someone's closet" when they are using the software on _your data_
[14:34:52] <qrpnxz> it's their code
[14:34:58] <kilobug> but your data

[14:42:03] <littlebobeep> Okay well in current form copyleft is enforced by copyright laws, that's what we have to work with, so when you say copyright is a limit on speech this is amiguous

[14:43:12] <qrpnxz> littlebobeep, it's not ambiguous. It's exactly that. Without copyright, you'd be able to recite all the songs, every movie, every book. You can record them and publish and share. With copyright you cannot. It's a monopoly on speech.
[14:43:31] <littlebobeep> qrpnxz: well you can't copy/modify a chair very much, but maybe the blueprints you used to make a chair could be shared (not very exciting blueprints but this gets more interesting if you incorporate electronics into your chair)
[14:43:44] <qrpnxz> I kind of made sense when publishing was very hard. Now it's trivial. We do it trillions of times per minute

[14:47:57] *** Joins: krung_thep (~krung_the@155.190.38.4)
[14:49:18] <littlebobeep> furrymcgee: Yes it does limit my right to share copyrighted content until some arbitrary experation date, also limits my ability to redistribute modified works except in some corner cases of "parody" or sharing short sections in a larger original work
[14:50:17] <littlebobeep> furrymcgee: Some might argue these restrictions are wrong given that making a copy does not detract from anyone materially it just creates another electronic number
[14:51:16] <furrymcgee> I would claim fair use
[14:51:18] <littlebobeep> furrymcgee: also about limiting: copyleft limits your ability to make a work non-free during redistribution, this is limiation for some (very arguable this causes net social benefits)
[14:51:27] <furrymcgee> but you need some protection to publish something
[14:51:31] <littlebobeep> furrymcgee: Fair use does not cover wholesale copying
[14:52:29] <littlebobeep> furrymcgee: Why are there copylefted or attribution-only or some small amounts of public domain (CC0 or something) works?  These are published with libre licenses, so no you do not need "some protection" to publish

[14:55:45] <littlebobeep> qrpnxz: If you think wish of original author is irrelevant, in a world where copyleft is not mandated, respecting the wish of the original author is the only way we can enforce copyleft on SOME percentage of produced works
[14:56:04] <littlebobeep> furrymcgee: Sorry I do not understand what you mean by "say something relevant"
[14:57:05] <qrpnxz> copyleft only need to exist because copyright exist. I want copyright to go away. For software freedom it's also necessary that a law pass requiring copies of programs to have corresponding source available, but that's it. Replace copyright with that and the world just became fucking awesome.

[15:03:34] <littlebobeep> qrpnxz: copylefted artwork would be nice too especially digitally created
[15:04:14] <qrpnxz> there is copyleft for artwork. Generally it's CC BY-SA
[15:04:53] <littlebobeep> But what you are argueing for is essentially copyleft I guess, you just don't want to call it that anymore because of the verbal similarity to (and derivation of) the word copyleft
[15:05:03] <littlebobeep> *the word copyright (d'oh)
[15:06:01] <qrpnxz> copyleft is a legal technique. I have no problem with copyleft. I'm saying it right now
[15:06:58] <littlebobeep> qrpnxz: Hmmm I know about CC BY-SA but I am not sure it has a clause specifying the form most ideal for editing/modification must also be made available alongside the shared work, whereas the GPL + AGPL have this
[15:07:30] <potatoxel[m]> littlebobeep: it doesnt
[15:07:34] <qrpnxz> it doesn't, that's not necessary to call it copyleft (at least now how it's generally used)
[15:07:35] <potatoxel[m]> but it has an anti-drm clause
[15:07:47] <littlebobeep> qrpnxz: Okay you have no problem with copyleft, but you said "copyleft only need to exist because copyright exist" 
[15:07:52] <qrpnxz> it's important for software freedom, but copyleft for art it's probably not essential
[15:08:05] <qrpnxz> littlebobeep, yes, there's no contradiction there lol
[15:08:39] <qrpnxz> not only does copyright make copyleft good, but copyleft can only exist with copyright. You can't make a copyright license without copyright.
[15:08:40] <littlebobeep> qrpnxz: Maybe not a contradiction, but you are basically advocating for legally required copyleft, you just don't want to use that word anymore?

[15:09:20] <littlebobeep> qrpnxz: We discussed this earlier in the channel, you could write a law specifically mandating copyleft and abolish the other parts of copyright laws
[15:09:58] <qrpnxz> no, i was saying if copyright went away, we still need the right to repair bills such as source availability and anti-tivo for software freedom

[15:12:08] <littlebobeep> DiffieHellman: You jumped on that one fast tho :P
[15:12:42] <qrpnxz> to me asset mean thing that go up in value so i'll take it :)
[15:12:51] <qrpnxz> asset good, liability bad
[15:13:08] <qrpnxz> "An asset is anything of value or a resource of value that can be converted into cash."
[15:13:20] <qrpnxz> that's from investopedia
[15:13:23] <qrpnxz> it has a lot of uses
[15:14:07] <qrpnxz> if someone is an asset to the team, that means they are really helpful and worth having around
[15:14:13] <DiffieHellman> Yes, assets are often fungible. Art isn't fungable.
[15:15:16] <qrpnxz> i'd say asset are generally not fungible. Cash is fungible. Assets tend to be somewhat unique each of them.
[15:15:43] <DiffieHellman> I'd say wheat or steel bars are pretty fungible.
[15:15:43] <qrpnxz> houses are not interchangable, all a bit different, or a lot different
[15:16:25] <qrpnxz> yeah, raw material like metal is more like cash
[15:16:37] <DiffieHellman> Yes, but using a building as an asset is quite a nasty move.
[15:17:10] <qrpnxz> it's just automatically an asset
[15:17:13] <qrpnxz> you don't have to decide it
[15:17:37] <qrpnxz> like cars are almost always a liability
[15:17:51] <White_Flame> art is an asset to the project, but it's not necessarily intrinsic in the art itself
[15:18:13] <DiffieHellman> *always a liability but often are required
[15:19:44] <qrpnxz> a car may not be a liability if it's a specific kind of car you buy
[15:20:13] <DiffieHellman> It might not be a liability if you don't drive the thing.
[15:20:38] <qrpnxz> riding it seldom help yea

[22:42:40] <lispmacs[work]> i was just wondering if any here knew of modern scientific/reprogrammable hand-held calculator that communicate with Gnu/Linux
[22:43:21] <lispmacs[work]> I've played around in the past with TI calculators over TiLP, but both the calculators and the codebase are getting pretty old
[22:43:43] <sysanon> lispmacs[work]: I guess TI calculators could work but it would require nonfree software to communicate with it.

[22:51:13] <kompowiec2> idk today you can even create via arduino
[22:54:22] <lispmacs[work]> I don't recall seeing any ready-to-buy DIY calculator with a really good interface, like a real nice button layout and screen
[22:54:35] <lispmacs[work]> a 4x4 matrix with sticky labels on it doesn't count
[22:55:34] <lispmacs[work]> i recall there was a guy working on a Forth-based calculator kit, see if I can find that link...
