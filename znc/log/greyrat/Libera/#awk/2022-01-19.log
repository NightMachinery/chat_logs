[11:50:13] <Patsie> no
[11:50:23] <Patsie> I think it's easier
[11:50:27] <Patsie> even _I_ can do it
[11:51:55] <Patsie> just one basic rule: /pattern/ { action }
[11:52:04] <Patsie> that's it. now you know awk
[11:52:39] <user51> sometimes i wish the pattern-action would've been recursive
[11:52:57] <uuidNuni1> awk '/pattern/ {print $0}'
[11:53:43] <user51> speaking of awk, any idioms for building graphs?
[11:54:11] <uuidNuni1> oh my god this one is awesome : http://awk.freeshell.org/AwkTips
[11:54:27] <Patsie> what kinds of graphs?
[11:54:34] <uuidNuni1> awk '{if ($0 ~ /pattern/) print $0}' === awk '/pattern/'
[11:55:06] <Patsie> *gasp* that's amazing! :)
[11:55:21] <user51> Patsie: hm, maybe a prefix tree
[11:55:52] <user51> i did write something, but i'm not very confident in it
[11:56:04] <uuidNuni1> Patsie:->  looks like i am getting started :P thanks
[11:56:05] <Patsie> that's very specific
[11:57:08] <Patsie> so not these kinds of graphs then? https://github.com/patsie75/awk-graph
[11:57:56] <user51> maybe we should just start with how to make nodes.
[11:58:13] <Patsie> good start
[11:58:30] <Patsie> currently trying to see if matrix multiplication is fast enough under awk for me
[11:58:40] <Patsie> first have to make it work though
[11:58:47] <Patsie> but I think I have something here now
[11:59:21] <user51> initial plan is something like 'function mknode(data) { nodes[++nodes[0]] = data }'
[11:59:39] <user51> but maybe i'm sticking to nawk too much there
[11:59:39] <Patsie> and how do you link nodes?

[12:01:15] <user51> http://sprunge.us/B4xFlR
[12:01:44] <Patsie> I don't like the global variable nature of that
[12:01:56] <Patsie> makes it hard to have 2 trees for example
[12:02:11] <user51> you could use multidimensional arrays for that, no?
[12:02:46] <Patsie> I usually pass an instance of the 'object' (just an array) as 'self' as a first argument to any function that relates to this object, so it can be modified
[12:02:59] <Patsie> then you can have (and pass) different 'objects' to the function each time
[12:03:39] <Patsie> see for example the 'chip' variable here -> https://github.com/patsie75/awk-chip8/blob/main/main.gawk
[12:03:49] <Patsie> which is just a single instance of a single VM
[12:04:09] <Patsie> but I could have multiple instances running at the same time (chip1, chip2, chip3)
[12:04:11] <user51> line 12?
[12:04:29] <Patsie> line 12 and then line 15, 16, 17, 21, 22, 25
[12:05:03] <Patsie> the instance is always passed to the function, the function can modify the instance and the modified instances is passed back
[12:05:14] <Patsie> thank god awk has pass by reference arrays :)
[12:06:13] <user51> maybe we could do something like tree["root"], with replace 'tree' with any name you'd like

[13:56:55] <Patsie> well, that's fine. plenty of non-native english speakers here (myself included)
