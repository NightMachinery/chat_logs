[15:22:28] <basuotoko> but in writting you can not engore that last 's' in 'month'. strange no?

[19:55:36] <huf> while you're waiting, why not try https://youglish.com/
[20:00:12] <audiophile_> i did, but it's not tagged poperly :(
[20:00:15] <audiophile_> thanks tho!
[20:00:42] <audiophile_> might as well type it out ig
[20:01:03] <huf> ig?
[20:01:07] <huf> oh.
[20:01:14] <huf> ygr
[20:01:48] <audiophile_> so, in american english, the 't' is elided/omitted if preceded by 'n' and followed by a consonant, like 'international' is pronounced inernational, dentist as denist etc, but what about words like: interview, internship, internal?
[20:02:05] <audiophile_> ig = i guess, i'll keep the slang to a minimum, my apologies
[20:02:47] <huf> I think it depends on the stress pattern
[20:03:21] <huf> I cant see how "internal" would work without the t, but "integral" works fine
[20:03:28] <huf> "internaltional" also works without the t
[20:04:20] <huf> oh you said that
[20:04:21] <huf> right
[20:04:30] <huf> dont think internship works either, but interview does
[20:04:49] <huf> cant be sure tho

[23:49:23] <TimMc> Hmm, audiophile_ disappeared. What's that tell syntax again?
[23:50:36] <blkshp> +tell TimMc this is what you must do
[23:50:36] <chat> Done.
[23:53:14] <TimMc> \o/
[23:53:14] <chat> TimMc: Sent 2m ago: <blkshp> this is what you must do
[23:55:17] <TimMc> +tell audiophile_I can't see a strong pattern, besides "internal" being Definitely Not OK to drop the t from. (Probably because of the stress on that syllable, yes.) But I don't know why the others vary. Also, yes, feel free to PM.
[23:55:17] <chat> Done.
