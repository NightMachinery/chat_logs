[03:02:27] <hmw[at]> Mako?? This channel seems very inactive to me. Am I missing messages here or what? The last message I see is from hansol, and before that one line I wrote myself yesterday
[03:03:23] <theskillwithin> people just don't have a lot of questions today I guess
[03:03:58] <hmw[at]> It's quite quiet here all the time, compared to a year ago tho.
[03:04:20] <hmw[at]> Otoh, hansol is weird anyways. Who knows, who they think they are talking to...
[03:04:41] <hmw[at]> This was the 2nd time I see them thanking someone who wasn't there

[03:17:54] <hmw[at]> Exactly
[03:18:57] <hmw[at]> I don't block people, so I was wondering, if something is technically wrong with my client
[03:21:06] <hassoon> hmw[at]: nah it's been silent https://i.imgur.com/iRYdTmJ.png
[03:21:41] <hassoon> hmw[at]: this too https://i.imgur.com/8Mt7pmD.png
[03:21:46] <hmw[at]> hassoon: Check the 3rd line to see what I was talking about
[03:21:56] <hmw[at]> thanks for the answer tho :)
[03:24:41] <hmw[at]> Urban dictionary for "Mako" isn't helping in making sense of that post of hansol

[18:14:07] <roxlu> Hi!
[18:14:56] <hassoon> hi
[18:15:32] <roxlu> I'm experimenting with a flex container that holds several child elements that also use flex. I'm trying to get overflow-x scrolling to work but not sure what's the correct appraoch
[18:15:40] *** Joins: bambanxx (~bambanx@181-163-33-161.baf.movistar.cl)
[18:15:46] <roxlu> I've created this codepen: https://codepen.io/roxlu/pen/QWMgLGP
[18:16:48] <roxlu> it's almost working, except that the #right-container still grows when it gets more `<div class="item" />` elements
[18:17:33] <roxlu> when you add some more of those `<div class="item">...</div>`, e.g. after line 14 and refresh you can see what I mean
[18:17:45] <roxlu> why is the parent growing there?
[18:20:47] <hassoon> roxlu: why are you making #right scrollable ?
[18:21:49] <roxlu> hassoon: why are you asking that? shouldn't I make it scrollable?
[18:23:19] <hassoon> roxlu: #right has its own scromm and does #right-container, that's a scrolls mess, you might want to just make the #right-container scrollable inside of #right , and just stretch #right to 100% width
[18:23:24] <hassoon> * own scroll
[18:23:30] <hassoon> * and so does *
[18:23:34] <hassoon> ffs i had it with typos
[18:25:13] <roxlu> hassoon: ah thanks! But I've only set `overflow-x` to #right, not to `#right-container`. Why do you say that `#right-container` also has scroll?
[18:26:09] <hassoon> roxlu: well.. never mind
[18:26:14] <hassoon> roxlu: have a look here https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/435
[18:26:30] <hassoon> roxlu: see my css additions under the comment line
[18:26:37] <roxlu> hey thanks!
[18:26:39] <roxlu> looking at it now
[18:27:16] <hassoon> you just need to give containers widthes
[18:27:34] <hassoon> so children adapt to those widthes, down to #right
[18:27:55] <roxlu> ok so that's required for the overflow I see
[18:30:52] <roxlu> and the `flex-shrink: 0` on the `div#right` is required to make sure the contents/children don't break out of it's size/widht
[18:30:59] <roxlu> why is that?
[18:31:21] <hassoon> roxlu: flex: 0 1 auto; given to #right means that #right needs grow taking up the ma possible space inside its container, which is #container, and the latter has now a width of 100%, thus #right will take the right width without growing out of #container's limits, and finally #container needs to have a parent that in its turn has a defined width, which is #site, so i gave #site a width of 100%, that's the
[18:31:27] <hassoon> sizing approach here
[18:31:49] <hassoon> * max possible space *
[18:32:59] <hassoon> roxlu: sizing elements needs an observation of the elements tree as well, you will want to size a targetted element and its ancestors that have no defined size, that's how sizing an element will make sense
[18:33:20] <roxlu> so `flex: 0 1 auto` means: `flex-grow: 0; flex-shrink: 1` and `flex-basis: auto`, right? What is causing it to "grow" into it's parent size? Isn't `flex-grow: 1` used to make sure an element grows into it's parent size?
[18:36:45] <hassoon> roxlu: sorry i meant flex: 1 0 0;
[18:37:31] <hassoon> roxlu: auto makes it grow beyond #container, that is, flex-grow:1; flex-shring:0; flex-basis:0
[18:37:32] <roxlu> ok thanks yeah that makes more sense to me, though `flex: 0 1 auto` also works
[18:38:09] <hassoon> roxlu: we give it an arbitrary width of 0, with the flex-basis:0, then flex-grow just gives it the max-possible space in its #container parent
[18:38:49] <hassoon> roxlu: right, flex:0 1 auto; works as well, since we tell #right to shrink when it starts growing beyond the parent's limits
[18:39:07] <hassoon> roxlu: by i intended to use the flex-grow approach beforehand anyway
[18:39:53] <roxlu> ok thanks, yeah, so the `flex: 1 0 0` means that it's internal content is still larger; so i can change it's scroll offset with JS for example?
[18:40:25] <hassoon> scroll offset? what do you mean
[18:40:46] <roxlu> I was thinking to use this to create a carousel for example
[18:41:11] <hassoon> ah, ya sure, javascript is your friend for dynamic interractions
[18:41:51] <roxlu> so lets say I change it's scroll position using JS, would there be a difference wether I use: `flex: 1 0 0` or `flex: 0 1 auto` ?
[18:44:35] <hassoon> roxlu: sizing has nothing to do with chaning scroll position, you'll need to manipulate the #right-container 's left or right properties after making it positioned
[18:44:44] <hassoon> roxlu: or come up with another similar approach
[18:45:35] <hassoon> roxlu: or changing the scroll position according to the client.X value i, relation with the dragged point under the cursor; etc
[18:45:48] <hassoon> roxlu: or just use a prepared library for you
[18:45:58] <hassoon> there are things like owl-carouse or slick.js nowadays
[18:46:06] <hassoon> but meh, doing it by hand is also nice
[18:46:23] <roxlu> yeah ok. I was trying to understand the differences between `flex: 0 1 auto` and `flex: 1 0 0`
[18:46:56] <hassoon> roxlu: nah flex is used for sizing purposes as we saw earlier

[18:55:19] <roxlu> ah so as soon as there is one child in the hierarchy up to the element that I want to use with overflow it 'fails' to work
[18:55:57] <roxlu> e.g. https://codepen.io/roxlu/pen/QWMgLGP  when you remove the `width: 100%` for `#app` there it won't work anymore
[18:59:05] <roxlu> so I guess there must be a better way to do this ^.^

[20:26:46] <roxlu> oh sorry hassoon, I was having dinner and didn't see you message
[20:27:11] <roxlu> but I meant that I should probably use a different structure/solution w/o nested flex boxes
[20:27:42] <roxlu> as, in my actual case I have ~6 parents which I now need to give a width

[23:07:32] <hassoon> roxlu: sure why not
[23:08:54] <roxlu> hey hassoon! I just got it working
[23:09:13] <roxlu> though tbh I don't fully understand one situation (...)
[23:09:49] <hassoon> which is ?
[23:09:52] <roxlu> When you look here: https://codepen.io/roxlu/pen/wvqeGVV  and change line 17 from `min-width: auto` to `min-width: 0` you can see that the container (blue border) changes. Why is that?
[23:13:14] <hassoon> roxlu: min-width:auto is like allowing it to take the the total width of its content, if there is not a set width already
[23:14:00] <roxlu> yeah I noticed that too, and min-width: 0, changes it in such a way that the element takes the size w/o looking at its children.

[23:14:21] <roxlu> I'm really curious where this is documented; I couldn't really find  the reason
[23:14:41] <hassoon> roxlu: min-width:0; is like telling it to have a width:0px at the least, otherwise let it resize automatically, but since it is a flex item, i.e a child of a flex container, it will take the width given by the flex
[23:15:17] <hassoon> roxlu: just read about the flex documentation in mdn
[23:15:44] <roxlu> ah that makes sense; but `flex-grow` is set to 0, doesn't that mean it's not allowed to grow?
[23:15:53] <hassoon> roxlu: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox
[23:16:42] <roxlu> thanks, I looked at that page  but it doesn't mention min-width; I've also looked at the w3c spec
[23:19:14] <hassoon> roxlu: min-width:auto is like telling the element to take up the total space formed from its children
[23:20:02] <hassoon> roxlu: and if that total width exceed the that of the parent, it will overflow it as seen in your sample
[23:20:06] <roxlu> yeah, I kind of understand `min-width: auto` also because that's the default and it's documented like having different behavior
[23:20:30] <roxlu> and now, I also understand the min-width: 0
[23:20:45] <roxlu> it's just interesting that I'm not seeing any real good info about this
[23:20:45] <hassoon> roxlu: to mimic the situation in another way, give the element a min-width:0; but also give it a width bigger than that of the parent's, and it will overflow
[23:20:55] <hassoon> roxlu: unless there is a max-width
[23:20:59] <roxlu> yeah

[23:21:41] <hassoon> roxlu: min-width:auto is like min-width:the total rendered width of the element, which hapens to be bigger than the parent in our case
[23:22:19] *** Joins: drej (~drej@user/drej)
[23:22:47] <hassoon> roxlu: but min-width:0 means literally the min-width accepted is 0, so the now the width is not forced to be the total width of the element, but it will be dictated by the parent flex container
[23:23:13] <hassoon> * so now the width *

[23:39:51] <sybariten> if i define both width and height for an object, how can i simply make the browser use the value that gives the smallest image? Do yuo understand what i mean? if i say height:400px; and width:400px; , i want the image to maintain aspect ratio but not go above any of those values
[23:40:52] <pavonia> Have a look at the object-fit property
