[12:26:01] <PMunch> @Bubblie, yes I get your pings through the bridges
[12:26:24] <PMunch> And no, a user don't need clang installed to run an application compiled with Futhark
[12:27:08] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Pmunch got a link to one of the playground tours, i really need to bookmark it for whenever it comes up again 😛
[12:27:37] <PMunch> And yes, it's a pain to get it working on Windows. I don't really have a Windows machine to test things on, but I might spin up a VM one of these days to see if I can make it work properly
[12:27:50] <PMunch> @Elegantbeef, I think those are broken unfortunately
[12:28:05] <PMunch> I tried to share a link to one a couple weeks back but it just kept erroring out
[12:28:08] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Ah
[12:28:30] <PMunch> And since no-one ever used the feature I think it will get removed in the redesign
[12:28:59] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> So i guess nevermind prestige no more tour'd playground
[12:29:46] <PMunch> I mean if you see a usecase for it I guess I could bring it back
[12:30:35] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Prestige wanted to port the Nim tutorial RSTs to an interactive tutorial so i suggested playground
[12:35:33] <PMunch> Aaah right, that would definitely be one way of doing it
[12:40:17] <PMunch> To be honest I'm not entirely sure why it suddenly broke

[12:49:50] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> nu
[12:50:08] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> if I check an empty one with echoes it prints : Slice[system.int]
[12:50:12] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> I want to check for that
[12:50:26] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> what's an empty hslice?

[13:57:19] <FromDiscord> <Phil> You can only do boolean compiler flags right? As in, check with "defined(compilerFlagName)", not associate a value with it?

[13:59:58] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> imho you must do this on C creation, but others might know a way
[14:04:13] <PMunch> Yeah I don't think there's a way to have a variant object limited to a certain kind. Would be neat though, especially for things like NimNodes
[14:04:28] <PMunch> @Phil, no you can also assign string and number values to them
[14:06:54] <FromDiscord> <TryAngle> In reply to @PMunch "Yeah I don't think": yes, I'm using a node structure right now but not having the limitation is also fine↵Thanks for answering, would be cool if something this would be implemented in the future
[14:07:03] <FromDiscord> <TryAngle> (edit) "In reply to @PMunch "Yeah I don't think": yes, I'm using a node ... structure" 03added "data"
[14:17:49] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> hooy
[14:18:20] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> do we happen to have something like python maketrans() and translate()
[14:18:52] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> seems very comfy
[14:20:16] <PMunch> We have strutils.multireplace which does the work of translate()
[14:20:44] <PMunch> And writing a makereplacements procedure should be fairly trivial, although I don't believe one exists in the standard library
[14:20:46] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> pmunchie thanks I'll go check
[14:21:17] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> I'll make one no prob, we must have 1:1 feature parity with pythons amiright?
[14:22:36] <FromDiscord> <TryAngle> may somebody ELI5 why objects can't be self referential but reference objects can 🥺
[14:24:57] <PMunch> @TryAngle, sure
[14:25:06] <PMunch> Objects are copied by value
[14:25:16] <FromDiscord> <demotomohiro> reference types are actually pointers
[14:25:40] <PMunch> Say object A has a single integer field, then its size would be 8 bytes (on a 64-bit machine)
[14:26:14] <PMunch> If object B has an int field and an object A field it would take 16 bytes, 8 for the int, and 8 for the A object
[14:27:02] <PMunch> Now if object C tries to have a object C field, that means that it is infinitely big, since its own size is recursively defined on itself
[14:27:24] <PMunch> However with references, as @demotomohiro pointed out, only a reference to that object is stored
[14:27:41] <PMunch> References are the same size as a pointer, and these are always fixed size
[14:28:03] <FromDiscord> <TryAngle> Ah I see that makes sense
[14:28:07] <PMunch> So If object C is a reference object, and it contains an object C field, it will also be 8 bytes big
[14:28:24] <PMunch> This is because pointers and references are 8 bytes on a 64-bit machine
[14:29:10] <FromDiscord> <TryAngle> sent a code paste, see https://paste.rs/GDC
[14:29:13] <PMunch> Now if object A had another int field and it was 16 bytes big, then object B would be 16+8=24 bytes large. But if object A was a reference object then object B would still be 16 bytes big, 8 for the reference to A, and 8 for the int
[14:29:38] <PMunch> @TryAngle, yes, or better yet a reference
[14:30:42] <FromDiscord> <TryAngle> ah ok, I understand now thanks a lot 🥺😊
[14:30:59] <FromDiscord> <TryAngle> the size definition was what I lacked I think 🤔
[14:31:02] <PMunch> https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3Tq7
[14:31:48] <PMunch> Might be even clearer with a repr: https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3Tq8
[14:32:26] <FromDiscord> <TryAngle> No reply from server: 502 💀💀
[14:32:36] <PMunch> @TryAngle, just try again
[14:32:39] <FromDiscord> <TryAngle> (edit) "502" => "503"
[14:33:03] <PMunch> Note that in a way a ref A is the same as an option, since the reference can be nil
[14:34:24] <PMunch> Ah never mind, the server is down for some reason..

[14:58:57] <FromDiscord> <fbpyr> I tried that as well.
[14:59:05] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> yeah you can do it like this as well (i use both styles, where i see it fits
[14:59:06] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> )
[14:59:16] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> I didn't know about your style
[14:59:23] <FromDiscord> <fbpyr> ah no mine is different
[15:01:52] <FromDiscord> <fbpyr> thank you for the different versions 😌
[15:05:10] <PMunch> They have their pros and cons. The second way might feel more common from other languages, but it has a couple drawbacks. Mainly that the resulting variable has to be a var, it's easier to leave in uninitialised by accident, with let and a block assignment Nim will check all your branches and guarantee that it is actually set to something, and it can't ever be changed after the initial assignment.
[15:14:01] <FromDiscord> <fbpyr> if the whole purpose of the conditional is getting to the variable (as in my example) , ↵then I actually like version 1 better. ↵but it is great to have seen both possibilities and reasoning of their pros/cons. 🙂
[15:16:21] <PMunch> I mean your initial problem is simply that the variable isn't declared in the scope you try to use it in

[16:03:39] <FromDiscord> <Bubblie> And should it be the path to the lib folder?
[16:06:53] <PMunch> Uhm, damn it, I should've written it down when I went through this with System64..
[16:09:07] <FromDiscord> <Rika> discord has a search function, do you know what you said roughly?

[16:09:28] <PMunch> I can't remember exactly when it was
[16:10:02] <PMunch> It was a conversation over multiple days between me and System64 Flandre Scarlett about clang, futhark, and windows paths
[16:12:33] <PMunch> @Bubblie, they had major issues with spaces in the path, so put it in a path without spaces
[16:12:49] <PMunch> And not sure what you mean path to the lib folder
[16:12:55] <PMunch> What exactly doesn't work?
[16:13:08] <PMunch> Can you install Futhark?
[16:13:13] <PMunch> Does it build Opir?
[16:14:55] <FromDiscord> <xflywind> In reply to @enthus1ast "have you seen these": I have no idea, but it looks like a gc bug.
[16:16:48] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> hoy do we have a builtin utility to iterate over multiline strings line by line?
[16:17:50] <FromDiscord> <Solitude> splitLines

[16:18:00] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> muh bro
[16:18:12] <PMunch> Nothing that takes a bunch of strings and iterates over all their lines though
[16:18:16] <PMunch> As far as I'm aware
[16:18:34] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> bunch as multiple different strings?
[16:18:48] <FromDiscord> <Solitude> thats called two for loops
[16:19:42] <PMunch> Yeah multiple different strings
[16:19:56] <PMunch> And is splitLines an iterator?
[16:20:02] <PMunch> Or will that allocate all the new strings?
[16:22:16] <FromDiscord> <Solitude> its both

[16:22:29] <PMunch> Nice
[16:22:35] <FromDiscord> <auxym> In reply to @Solitude "thats called two for": or something like chain from https://github.com/narimiran/itertools
[16:23:53] <FromDiscord> <Solitude> In reply to @auxym "or something like chain": that requires to allocate each subsequence of lines, losing the advantage of iterated form
[16:31:16] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> also do we have some fuzzy thing for measuring the string distance of 2 strings like Levenshtein or whatever
[16:32:28] <FromDiscord> <Rika> https://nim-lang.org/docs/editdistance.html

[16:48:09] <FromDiscord> <Bubblie> Trying to remember

[16:48:48] <FromDiscord> <Bubblie> (edit) "lclang”" => "-lclang”"
[16:48:51] <PMunch> Yeah, for that libclang.dll or whatever needs to be in your library loading path
[16:49:13] <FromDiscord> <Bubblie> Ah okay, so im assuming that dll is somewhere in the install
[16:49:31] <PMunch> On linux this includes a system path (so you can just do `apt install libclang; nimble install futhark`) but on Windows I'm not sure how that works
[16:49:38] <PMunch> Yeah it should be in the lib folder of clang

[20:27:34] <FromDiscord> <spoon> how
[20:27:34] <nrds> <06Prestige99> But also, use choosenim
[20:28:12] <nrds> <06Prestige99> Weren't you going to switch to fedora?

[20:28:28] <nrds> <06Prestige99> Guess that was someone else
[20:29:21] <PMunch> @spoon, the Manjaro Nim package should be more up to date than that..
[20:29:35] <PMunch> Could you do `pacman -Qo nim` for us?
[20:29:40] <FromDiscord> <spoon> In reply to @PMunch "<@161097102288486400>, the Manjaro Nim": sent a photo from ubuntu on wsl

[20:29:56] <PMunch> That makes more sense :P
[20:30:56] <nrds> <06Prestige99> looks like the aur is up to 1.4.6
[20:31:01] <FromDiscord> <huantian> I still like to use choosenim on rolling distros like arch↵↵And with python i still do use pyenv
[20:31:31] <FromDiscord> <huantian> Isn’t Nim in official repos?
[20:32:01] <nrds> <06Prestige99> oh it is. Up to 1.4.8 on arch
[20:33:51] <FromDiscord> <huantian> Yeah I wonder why it still hasn’t been updated
[20:34:31] <nrds> <06Prestige99> I think the TUs/devs have a lot of stuff to maintain so there are some out of date packages in the official repos
[20:35:05] <FromDiscord> <huantian> Yeah ig
[20:37:05] <FromDiscord> <spoon> huh.
[20:38:15] <FromDiscord> <spoon> is there an up-to-date nim-git version on the aur?
[20:38:27] <nrds> <06Prestige99> it's also out of date on the aur

[21:49:54] <FromDiscord> <Kiwids> the program exit regardless. I think its because I messed up on the while loop there. if it returns false. would it just exit

[21:58:40] <FromDiscord> <Phil> not fubar by any means, but a version number is absolutely not what it should be
[21:59:42] <FromDiscord> <Phil> I did a minor update where it essentially allows you to compile out the log statements (or rather it compiles in log statements if you activate a specific flag).↵I then went to the nimble github page to once more check out what I should be doing because I keep forgetting that one.↵The steps apparently just were: Make a git tag, push the git tag, done

[23:08:12] <nrds> <06Prestige99> e.g. https://github.com/avahe-kellenberger/safeset and a Seq2D thing I made...
[23:09:18] <FromDiscord> <auxym> In reply to @auxym "That's the same MCU": But in general, the idea is to figure out how to compile a C program "from scratch" for the MCU, then just adapt that to nim. tell Nim to use the right compiler (avr-gcc for avr), link the vendor-provided startup file, use the vendor linker script if applicable, importc some register mappings from C headers, etc
[23:09:33] <PMunch> @spoon, @auxym, yup it's the same one, so Ratel should work on it :)
