[00:00:30] <zacque> Thanks, this is it in full: https://paste.debian.net/1234775/
[00:00:46] <zacque> So, invoking (slime-eval* '(+ 1 2)) works right out of the box
[00:01:48] <zacque> I'll keep in mind the limitations that _death pointed out just now

[00:07:35] <hashfunc569> is there a way to ask the SBCL compiler to warn you if you never use a :READER or :WRITER function of a class?
[00:07:53] <Devon> zacque: You might give a doc string, e.g., "Like `slime-eval' but user friendly."
[00:08:05] <hashfunc569> *:READER or :WRITER function designator of a slot
[00:10:34] <Bike> hashfunc569: doubtful. they're globally defined, so they could be used somewhere outside of any code you compile.

[00:12:06] <zacque> Devon: Right, thanks for reminding
[00:13:00] <hashfunc569> Bike: that is very unfortunate
[00:14:17] <hashfunc569> now i'm really debating going back to just using DEFSTRUCT
[00:14:21] <Devon> hashfunc569: No doubt some general purpose tool like that is buried in some obscure paper or thesis.
[00:14:38] <_death> how come? if you want something to warn you, you can write define-hashfunc-class that does that
[00:14:40] <Bike> um, you'd have the same problem with defstruct accessors
[00:15:32] <hashfunc569> _death: that is a possible solution
[00:15:50] <hashfunc569> Bike: reason being is that now the code can't be self-documenting
[00:16:02] <Bike> huh?
[00:16:10] <Bike> what does documentation have to do with the warning?
[00:16:42] <_death> hmm, I misunderstood what you asked for.. do you mean if you have a :reader foo in a defclass, the compiler should at some point warn you about it not being used up to that point?
[00:17:25] <hashfunc569> _death: yes, exactly
[00:17:35] *** Quits: lisp123 (~lisp123@120.154.103.52) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:17:41] <_death> at what point would that be? any why?
[00:18:13] <_death> (and how does defstruct give better result there?)
[00:18:14] <hashfunc569> because if it's defined, but not used it code-bloat
[00:18:24] <hashfunc569> with defstruct there
[00:18:43] <_death> in Lisp you do incremental development.. if you haven't used something up to now, it doesn't mean you won't use it in the future
[00:18:57] <Bike> there's no way to institute a warning like this for defstruct either. for example, you could define a structure without :read-only t, but never use a writer, and there'd be no warning for that
[00:19:05] <Bike> define a structure slot*
[00:20:15] <hashfunc569> Bike: that's a good point
[00:20:54] <_death> maybe your question makes some sense when you package something up for delivery and want to drop some code that you know won't ever be used (some form of "tree shaking") but otherwise it doesn't make sense to me
[00:21:26] <Bike> yeah, more or less. it's more like a linting concern than anything that a compiler is doing
[00:24:17] <hashfunc569> ok fair enough. but i'm the type of person that when i see a :WRITER function defined for a class, i will cache that it my mind, thinking, "ok, this slot will at some point be written to" but since that may not be the cause, i can no longer hold that thought as an invariant
[00:26:45] *** Joins: kpoeck (~kpoeck@2a01:598:91b8:b3ce:bc97:f836:708c:4633)
[00:26:56] <Bike> yeah, i don't think it's unreasonable to want it.
[00:26:56] <_death> instead maybe think in terms of interfaces and protocols, not slots.. slots are often just an implementation detail, and :writer is just sugar to define a method to set the slot's value..
[00:34:57] <hashfunc569> i see what you're saying
[00:35:20] <hashfunc569> unfortunately :READER nor :WRITER can't be set to nil either
[00:36:06] <_death> what do you mean? you can just not have them
[00:36:44] <hashfunc569> right, but being as explicit about the data structures as possible is what i'm aiming for
[00:37:04] <_death> not sure what this has to do with data structures
[00:37:20] <hashfunc569> a slot is part of the structure of the data
[00:38:08] <_death> right.. and readers/writers are one way to access it, so?
[00:38:12] <Bike> not having a :writer seems pretty explicit to me
[00:40:53] <_death> maybe you want to be explicit about an _abstract data type_.. then you can define a class that has no slots at all, (defclass queue () ()) .. and a bunch of defgenerics like (defgeneric queue-insert (queue item)) (defgeneric queue-empty-p (queue)) etc.
[00:41:21] <_death> then, you can have a (defclass my-super-weird-queue (queue) ()) (defmethod queue-insert ...) etc.
[00:41:27] <_death> (well, with slots)
[00:42:41] <_death> a user then usually doesn't have to know anything about the implementation of my-super-weird-queue, just care about the protocol (that it's a subclass of queue, and implements the right semantics for the defgenerics)

[10:34:49] <Josh_2> Good morning
[10:35:36] <Josh_2> I am using bknr, I have to change the class of a lot of items in my datastore in a single loop, would I be better off with a single transaction or one for each changed item? This action has to be performed in the background
[10:36:47] <Josh_2> Ofcourse I am using the mp-store.
[10:39:12] <Josh_2> I guess it would be useful in this case to lock the entire database just while I perform this background task, I dont think it should take long
[10:39:29] <Josh_2> well obviously it wont with small numbers but who knows about processing millions O:

[11:13:44] <pjb> But it's designed to process conditions, with a restart-case and handler-bind. I'm not sure how to do it for a mere warn call.
[11:14:37] <pjb> Ah, yes.  WARN signals a WARNING condition. So you'd handler-bind WARNING and call muffle-warning there.
[11:15:54] <Josh_2> This is what I have done, thanks

[12:25:43] <jackdaniel> heh, right you are (although I don't see the filling, so "not segfaults" would be more appropriate than "works") thanks
[12:26:49] <flip214> jackdaniel: it takes a few seconds and a bit of zooming, then I can see a blue background color.
[12:27:26] <jackdaniel> see how it looks in the browser
[12:27:43] <jackdaniel> there is a solid filling at the intersection of three shapes
[12:28:29] <jackdaniel> I've been experimenting on how you could implement the clip as an intersection of various regions in svg
[12:29:06] <jackdaniel> there were also some segfaults when I was tinkering with filters, but now I'm not so convinced to assert that it is "inkscape" fault, perhaps another missing paren ,)

[23:12:21] <tane> Howdy; how could I sort a part of a vector, i.e. only sort elements between indices 4..10 or something like that?
[23:13:37] <Catie> Would making a displaced vector across those indices work? I know vector displacement has some weird gotchas, but my impression is that it would also modify the underlying vector
[23:13:50] <Catie> Or, if you don't need destructive modification, there's always good old SUBSEQ
[23:14:37] <pjb> (let ((vector (vector 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1)) (start 3) (length 3))  (sort (make-array length :displaced-to vector :displaced-index-offset start) (function <)) vector) -> #(9 8 7 4 5 6 3 2 1)
[23:15:06] <tane> Catie, pjb thanks!
