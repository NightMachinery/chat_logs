[18:14:30] <ThePendulum> my grandfather's health is declining and my mom managed to record 40 minutes of him telling stories today, I'm so glad
[18:14:42] <ThePendulum> we have tapes of my other grandfather who died in 2001 and those are invaluable
[18:17:40] <joepie91> ThePendulum: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3710646
[18:17:43] <joepie91> these things are amazing

[18:21:27] <ThePendulum> I still haven't fixed my printer :(
[18:21:45] <joepie91> also interestingly this filament is stupid cheap[
[18:21:49] <joepie91> 10 EUR per kg
[18:21:52] <ThePendulum> what is it?
[18:22:00] <joepie91> (actually 9, before the price rise due to plastic prices rising)
[18:22:02] <joepie91> GST3D
[18:22:12] <unfinity> ・゜゜・。。・ ​ ゜゜\_o​< QU​ACK!
[18:22:16] <joepie91> you can only buy it (cheaply?) in bulk though, per 10 rolls
[18:22:16] <joepie91> ,bef
[18:22:17] <unfinity> joepie91 you befriended a duck in 4.945 seconds! You have made friends with 204 ducks in #datahoarder.
[18:22:20] <joepie91> but mixing colors is possible
[18:22:22] <joepie91> we did a groupbuy with revspace
[18:22:35] <joepie91> 90 EUR for 10 rolls, free shipping, apparently locally produced in EU too
[18:22:43] <ThePendulum> neat
[18:22:56] <joepie91> haven't tested the other colors yet, apparently quality and ideal printing temp varies somewhat between colors
[18:23:01] <ThePendulum> are you still in the same revspace after you moved? at least I thought you did
[18:23:08] <joepie91> you mean hackerspace?
[18:23:11] <joepie91> revspace is a specific hackerspace :p
[18:23:13] <ThePendulum> oh
[18:23:15] <joepie91> there's only one!
[18:23:15] <ThePendulum> d'oh
[18:23:23] <joepie91> but yeah, I haven't been to any hackerspace lately
[18:23:31] <joepie91> the filament came to me through a complicated logistics chain lol
[18:23:47] <ThePendulum> ahh you have contacts
[18:24:19] <joepie91> the person coordinating the groupbuy received the total order at home, then brought my rolls to revspace, which were then picked up a couple months later at revspace by someone else who happened to be choochoo'ing past Rosmalen, and today I met up with them at the station to pick it up
[18:27:02] <ThePendulum> hah
[18:27:31] <ThePendulum> hm shit, we have/had a digitized recording from the 60s from one of my dad's uncles, but all I can find is a .cda file... which I understand is just the index, no actual audio

[18:52:22] <joepie91> maybe mkv
[18:52:52] <ThePendulum> trying to see if there are any players that can display the text as the audio is playing in the first place
[18:54:15] <ThePendulum> this recording is from the 60s as was sent from Australia by an uncle that moved there from the Netherlands, and his wife is asking how we're doing "in the south" lol
[18:55:42] <ThePendulum> this is a blast "Nico is saying we're running out of tape, so we'll flip it around and we'll talk on the other side"
[18:57:53] <ThePendulum> trying to think though, this was the 60s, why didn 
[18:58:06] <ThePendulum> didn't they make a phone call
[18:58:34] <ThePendulum> was that still more difficult or costly then recording a tape and sending it across the globe by mail?
[18:59:32] <ThePendulum> I love that he throws in the second tape, and then spends a long time talking about how he doesn't have much tape left
[19:01:07] <ThePendulum> he's saying it's 45°C in his room, bloody hell
[19:07:18] <ThePendulum> weird, the tape fades out before he's done talking
[19:15:35] <evilgohan2> ThePendulum: FLAC and MP3 both have fields for "Lyrics"
[19:16:13] <ThePendulum> hmm guess that'd be a better avenue to look for playback
