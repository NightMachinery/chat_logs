[02:40:23] <ljharb> to build an app overall? yeah generally
[02:40:36] <ljharb> like figure out your problem domain and figure out how you're going to model that in the database
[02:41:54] <ross> hi all, got a weird question and hoping someone might be able to advise me. I'm making a programme (with Electron) for writing/editing a certain kind of file (it's effectively a dialogue tree editor for game design). The current data is stored internally as an object and saved 1:1 as a JSON file, which implementations of this dialogue tree tool will read during the game's runtime. A new issue I'm encountering is that as I add more features to this
[02:41:54] <ross> tool, it's starting to make more sense not to represent the data internally as a JS object but to use some sort of RDBMS. When the user starts using the tool it would read the JSON file, parse it to a database, use the RDBMS to apply changes to it, and then when saving instead of saving the database it would export to JSON. This isn't an idea I've seen elsewhere so I'm not sure how to feel about it  - does anyone think this is a good/bad idea?
[02:42:02] <iffraff> so, when I think about a model, I think about ... objects.  normalized, for the db but still you think in terms of client, purchase order etc.  these are the things in oop you would then building to a domain model
[02:43:03] <ljharb> iffraff: i'm not talking about a software model
[02:43:11] <ljharb> iffraff: your code doesn't have to be MVC and match your database

You have a repository, it queries the db, gets the data populates an object returns that to the controller action and if that's all the requst is for it returns the data.  if there is some behavior then maybe you get two objects and one does something to the other returns.  is

[03:02:59] <iffraff> ah, right.  so I guess in the case of a get, fp and oop are pretty similar.
[03:04:53] <iffraff> ljharb: so I guess the difference comes in when it's a post right? in oop you would get an object, add to that object or it's collections, and persist where as in fb you would just persist?  is that right?
[03:05:11] <OhTheCode> if I have a line in HTML: <script src="./debug.js"</script>, is there any way to take this line out on build? is that a babel thing? Is it a webpack thing? I guess I could write some javascript to do that, i'm sure this problem has been solved before
[03:05:43] <Deide> Technically, a function in fp "does" nothing. It is just a map of inputs to outputs and could be replaced by a table lookup. Most languages use the word function for both functions and procedures.
[03:06:29] <GreenJello> OhTheCode, neither really interact with HTML by default

[03:07:53] <ljharb> iffraff: mainly it's that in OOP, you pass around objects that escort methods. in FP, you pass around data and operate on things with standalone, usually pure, functions.
[03:08:20] <iffraff> OhTheCode: alternatively you could have an env variable that is emitted based on environment
[03:08:31] <austincheney> iffraff, fp deals with inputs and outputs such that function is a magic bag.  It takes certain inputs and provides an output (default undefined or void in JavaScript)
[03:08:44] <OhTheCode> GreenJello: good idea, i guess its not a big deal for me, i can remove the lines on build or do as you say import it in, never used an import statement yet

[03:09:31] <austincheney> iffraff, in oop its not about inputs and outputs.  It is about reference.  You have a base object.  You can call an instance of that base object that you can then modify and that modified thing can be called by something else and further modified.  That is the nature of inheritance
[03:10:08] <GreenJello> and make it conditional on process.env.NODE_ENV (I forget if webpack sets this by default now)

[03:10:47] <austincheney> iffraff, OOP is generally what is taught in CS courses because it addresses composition.  junior (or just shitty) programmers cannot get past composition and OOP makes that easier.

[03:11:40] <iffraff> so, fp cuts out the middle man, or ... adds a middle man I guess that being the function.  so if I have a user and I want to add an auth setting to it, I would have an auth "function" that would just go and update the db straight up, rather than retrieving the user and calling a method on it such as "add auth" and persisting it
[03:11:40] <Deide> I think OOP is taught because it more easily models the real world.
[03:11:47] <ljharb> it really doesn't tho
[03:11:54] <ljharb> most things aren't inheritance hierarchies
[03:12:03] <ljharb> "traits" is something that models the real world better tho
[03:12:36] <ljharb> OOP is likely taught because teachers were taught it as dogma, and people pass that knowledge on
[03:12:41] <Deide> There are lots of hierarchies in the world.
[03:12:45] <ljharb> that's why people double-space after a period decades after it was wrong to do it
[03:12:51] <ljharb> Deide: pick one?
[03:12:51] <iffraff> oop is not dependent on inheritance.
[03:12:52] <austincheney> iffraff, you are over thinking this.  a function is a bag of instructions.  it does something and then there is output.  the end.

[03:13:40] <austincheney> oop is dependent upon polyinstantiation where inheritance comes from, so while oop is not dependent upon inheritance you will generally have inheritance with oop

[03:16:21] <austincheney> originally OOP was about memory conservation
[03:16:28] <Deide> ljharb: Many organisations are hierarchies, with hierarchies of permissions/access.
[03:16:34] <austincheney> but that becomes irrelevant once you introduce garbage collection

[03:19:13] <ljharb> iffraff: validation functions et

[03:23:17] <austincheney> iffraff, when you "load up" data you are putting it from storage into memory.  after that it can be modified by anything that accesses it.

[03:26:40] <wroathe> iffraff: Generally speaking, a module full of functions. You still have constructor functions that take input, and produce a new object to operate on as output, and then other functions to manipulate that returned value. The primary difference between using a class for an API and a module for an API is that the functions don't have implicit context (no this), and so the object needs to be passed

[03:27:27] <naeluh_weds> Deide: yeah I was just looking at that
[03:27:31] <wroathe> iffraff: And if you don't want the burden of passing your object through the functions manipulating it, you would then use composition to compose a new function that performs the set of modifications you were planning on performing
[03:27:44] <Deide> GreenJello: Yeah it's a problem if you want to model *all* of reality.
[03:27:55] <Deide> But you're usually not doing so
[03:27:58] <naeluh_weds> I think that will do it
[03:29:06] <wroathe> iffraff: At it's heart FP really only requires two things: the ability to define functions as first-class values, and the ability to pass those functions to other functions (higher-order functions), that can then call them
[03:29:15] <GreenJello> Deide, it shouldn't be this easy to break it
[03:29:49] <Deide> In general though, it's just easier to map objects with properties and behaviours to things in reality.
[03:30:26] *** Joins: keypusher (keypusher@user/keypusher)
[03:31:03] <Deide> But I make no argument about its effectiveness in making programs.
[03:31:12] <iffraff> wroathe: so, let's discuss DDD.  one aspect of ddd is that you have an object and that object has children and it maintains the internal consistency of it's data.  How would you do something like that in fp?
[03:32:05] <wroathe> iffraff: encapsulation is not high on the list of priorities for functional programmers
[03:32:23] <wroathe> iffraff: If you need information hiding, you would use a closure
[03:32:41] <iffraff> but wadr data consistency is important to applications.
[03:33:12] <iffraff> if you have a complex domain, you have complex business logic that manages what data can do what.
[03:33:13] <Deide> iffraff: In good FP languages, you'd probably define your domain as a collection of types, and then you'd write the business (the functions). Simple as that really.
[03:33:40] <jaawerth> you can still implement that logic without mixing your nouns and verbs together
[03:34:05] <iffraff> Deide: so oop with the behavior living outside the object.  In functions
[03:35:00] <Deide> I guess
[03:35:48] <iffraff> so the data integrity part of the ddd agregate root is that it embodies the business rules that apply to specific parts of the data.
[03:36:32] <jaawerth> one compromise I sometimes like to make is to reduce the methods that live on the object to a core set of fundamental prodocols, and then the data operations are all done in terms of those, so anything that implements the core protocols can also be made compliant, without baking in a ton of behavior into a prototype
[03:36:48] <wroathe> iffraff: For an extreme example, here's how a Map is defined in Haskell: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers-0.4.0.0/docs/Data-Map.html. If you skim through this module you'll notice that pretty much every function takes a Map k v as an argument. There's no mention of what "private" fields a Map may contain, and there's no public/private distinction:
[03:37:08] <iffraff> what it still sounds like to me is that with fb, you have all the business logic in a module that applies to this kind of data .  it's basically the same thing

[03:38:03] <Deide> Yeah, you can make the same thing in two different styles.
[03:38:10] *** Joins: banana_ (~banana_@user/banana/x-2944094)
[03:38:17] <jaawerth> well, in FP, 1) your methods functions all pure (or at least that's what you strive for), with all the mutations living in walled areas, and 2) you keep your nouns and verbs separate. if you have a strong type psystem you can make guarantees and dispatch based on type, but in a dynamic lang you can't lean on that
[03:38:23] <wroathe> iffraff: Well, what I said isn't totally true. They haven't exported the data constructors for Map, and so there's no straightforward way to pattern match against it to extract the "private" fields.
[03:38:26] <Deide> One might end up being easier to extend, refactor or maintain later on though
[03:38:27] <jaawerth> !nouns
[03:38:28] <jellobot> jaawerth, In JavaScript, verbs are equally important as nouns. http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html
[03:38:43] <wroathe> iffraff: So I suppose that could be seen as a form of encapsulation
[03:39:24] <iffraff> wroathe: I'm not concerned with making data private.  I'm concerned with let's say a user has a credit limit, but they want to purchase a product on credit.  the user would check the users creditlimit  and determine if that's ok.  if so it allows the user to make the purchase
[03:41:48] <wroathe> iffraff: Right, so that would just be a function that takes the purchase price, and an account, and then returns an indication of whether the purchase succeeded or not, and the new account (potentially with a new balance)
[03:41:52] <iffraff> wroathe: so in fp you can have nouns.  and those nouns can be denormalized.  and you can employ pure functions that determine what those nouns can and can not do.
[03:42:00] <wroathe> iffraff: Price -> Account -> Maybe Account
[03:42:22] <jaawerth> and typically you'd have some kind of validator contract or w/e to catch when you use a function on something incompatible
[03:43:26] <iffraff> so the fp aproach while simple in it's implementation is highly unstructured in the organization of the business rules.

[03:49:28] <Deide> Having "just a bag" and functions that work on them does tend to be easier to grok than how complicated all the ceremony involved in classes and objects can be. And one of the goals of DDD is to be familiar to the domain experts.

[04:02:29] <banana_> dude good luck man, I'd like to see your solution for this shit in ember. no disrespect though because I'm know you're solid so seriously though i'd like to know what you'd do.
[04:02:46] <deltab> iffraff: consider calculating the tax on an order, say. In a strongly OOP approach, that's associated with the order and its contents, right?
[04:03:12] <iffraff> yes most likely
[04:03:38] <banana_> basically the components are overridable in the ember template so I adopted the template in a very ember specific way.
[04:03:54] <deltab> so the order has a method to calculate the tax, and it presumably has to know the tax rate, thresholds, etc.
[04:04:06] <wroathe> iffraff: Here's another concrete example. In an OOP context you might create an SQLClient class that can establish a connection, maintain a connection pool, and then execute queries (hypothetically). An FPer would just define a module that contains a function that takes the database credentials, and returns a connect pool, and then a set of functions that take a connection pool as one of their
[04:04:12] <wroathe> parameters. Like const execute = (connections, query) => ...
[04:04:19] <banana_> that way I was able to use the same template for different instances basically. I was able to abstract the template and be reusable.
[04:04:41] <wroathe> banana_: "good luck man" was that for me?
[04:05:08] <banana_> yeah haha because this framework's templating isnt like react.

[04:05:27] <banana_> but it was like out of being exhaustion working on this project really
[04:05:37] <wroathe> banana_: templating as javascript frameworks use it, and templating as the "template method" defines it above are two entirely different things
[04:05:39] <banana_> out of exhaustion*
[04:05:49] <wroathe> banana_: I'm not talking about the kind of templates you bind data to
[04:05:51] <banana_> wroathe: kinda
[04:06:03] <wroathe> banana_: You'll have to check out that wikipedia article I linked for context
[04:06:10] <deltab> iffraff: and likewise for other things the order has to deal with; so you can end up a complex Order class with lots of methods
[04:06:14] <iffraff> wroathe: I mean I would have a repository that could be instantiated and upon instantiation it would create a connection.   I mean I'm guessing dependency injection is not used by fp?
[04:06:25] <banana_> if you consider the route object and controller object AND template, of this js framework, as the "template" it's the exact same idea.
[04:07:02] <banana_> you keep the base controller, route AND template. and then you override whatever you want.
[04:07:12] <wroathe> banana_: Sometimes you're locked in to how a framework does things. That's part of the evaluation process of choosing a framework.
[04:07:14] <banana_> you have the same template but you override dynamic components in the template.
[04:07:31] <banana_> dude trust I don't know who the efff that guy was lol
[04:07:36] <wroathe> banana_: If the framework authors come from an OOP background, they're quite likely to use inheritance as a golden hammer
[04:08:17] * jaawerth glares in angular1.x
[04:08:18] <banana_> ember definitely came from that background. because there's "hooks" that you can override which smells, to me, like java programming
[04:08:23] <wroathe> iffraff: There's a few ways to do "DI". One that comes to mind is with a closure.
[04:08:25] <deltab> iffraff: but another way to structure that would be to make the Order a simple container for data, and put the logic elsewhere, with a tax calculator service that takes an order and the tax rate config, and applies the tax to the order.
[04:08:32] <banana_> e.g. stuff from "Essentially Java"
[04:08:53] <wroathe> iffraff: So you take a function that receives the parameter you want to "inject", and that returns a set of functions that now implicitly have that in their scope through closure
[04:09:11] <banana_> I meant this book sry https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0134685997/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=java+essential&qid=1625096334&s=books&sr=1-2

[04:09:27] <jaawerth> no such thing
[04:09:29] <jaawerth> heyooo
[04:09:52] <banana_> wroathe: You're talking about the "template method" I know.
[04:09:55] <wroathe> iffraff: Another way to implement it for limited use cases would be with default parameters.

[04:37:35] <Deide> The principle way to achieve polymorphism in OOP languages was /traditionally/ subtyping and also a little but of ad hoc polymorphism. in functional language, they tended to go much further with the parametric polymorphism with a little bit of ad hoc polymorphism.

[08:51:53] <ronald_mcdonald> In a complex ui is it preferable to use divs rather than native controls?
[08:52:00] <ronald_mcdonald> (in the interest of performance)
[08:52:35] <Rockwood_> lol No discussions about FreeNode or COVID drama
[08:54:31] <ronald_mcdonald> Rockwood_, I would of course avoid writing a custom text box
[08:54:47] <ronald_mcdonald> Both due to the difficulty of such an undertaking and due to it often being highly specialized to the users needs
[08:55:52] <GreenJello> performance isn't really a factor there
[08:56:16] <GreenJello> you sometimes don't use native controls because they're restrictive
[08:56:39] <ronald_mcdonald> GreenJello, I imagine a page with a 1000 native buttons (for example a database frontend) might get too heavy
[08:56:46] <ronald_mcdonald> vs if these "buttons" were really divs
[08:57:15] <GreenJello> I don't have any reason to believe it would be
[08:57:25] <GreenJello> would need to try it with both and measure
[08:57:54] <ronald_mcdonald> I am quite sure it was, I have a vague memory of some database tool hanging my browser on a large table
[08:58:11] <GreenJello> and you tried only changing the button to a div?
[08:58:18] <ronald_mcdonald> It was not my app
[08:58:33] <GreenJello> then I don't see how you came to that conclusion
[08:58:44] <GreenJello> there are lots of reasons an app can be slow
[08:58:51] <ronald_mcdonald> The first statement is lived experience, the second is conjecture
[08:59:21] <GreenJello> I mean I don't see why you even considered the buttons to be a potential issue
[08:59:37] <GreenJello> it seems random
[08:59:50] <ronald_mcdonald> Native controls can be heavy is all I am saying
[08:59:59] <GreenJello> based on what?
[09:00:19] <ronald_mcdonald> Both because I doubt they were designed to be used for apps with 1000 controls and due to the ffi delays
[09:00:28] <ronald_mcdonald> oh wait
[09:00:44] <ronald_mcdonald> ffi shouldn't be an issue if the browser is just feeding its in-memory js representations
[09:01:23] <ronald_mcdonald> GreenJello, but yes I will have to test to verify
[09:02:43] <GreenJello> you typically have FFI with translation when interacting with the DOM, since it's communication between JS and C++
[09:03:30] <GreenJello> once you're in C++, any dynamically linked C FFI is potentially free
[09:03:53] <GreenJello> it might have to convert between different struct layouts, but it's not an inherent cost
[09:04:10] <ronald_mcdonald> Yeah thats what I realized

[14:45:20] <wallbroken> if it's not. then i stop talking
[14:45:34] <Intelo> Is it true that on most job portals, the application is sent to recruiter agencies (the job post is posted by recruiter agencies) and the candidate never talk to the real company until the final interview?
[14:46:01] <entuland> wallbroken, as I stated multiple times, I'm happy to help you learn and improve, not going to just give you the code for you to slap there with no understanding whatsoever

[16:16:56] <entuland> wallbroken, your programming experience in other contexts should make you already able to see how to solve the problem
[16:17:18] <entuland> all you _should_ be missing are the details of how to do that in javascript
[16:17:58] <entuland> if you want the "high level" solution, here it is: loop through the checkboxes during the execution of the submit, collect the values, send them over to the server
[16:18:00] <entuland> simple as that
[16:20:04] <entuland> if your problem really was just finding that "high level" description of the solution, then your missing basics may be way more deeply rooted than you may think, and may affect the actual basics of programming in general, regardless of the language or technology or framework at hand
[16:20:38] <wallbroken> "loop through the checkboxes"
[16:20:49] <wallbroken> i'm asking how to do this since 1 hours
[16:21:08] <entuland> did you try googling "javascript loop through checkboxes"?

[16:22:47] <entuland> the sad thing is that instead of trying to understand whatever code you'll find to learn how javascript works, you'll likely end up copypasting the first bit of code that vaguely seems to be doing what you want

[16:23:58] <entuland> diverdude, the code in the head will be executed _before_ the page gets rendered on the client side
[16:24:03] <Cork> diverdude: either you need to wait for DOMContentLoaded or move the script tag to the end of body
[16:24:08] <diverdude> Cork: right....i thought it might have been that..... how can i get around that issue?

[16:24:49] <Cork> np
[16:25:57] <entuland> diverdude, you may also need to check the objects you're querying for before trying to call members on them, to avoid breaking the execution of your JS
[16:27:37] <entuland> also, querySelector() and querySelectorAll() - in case you'll need them for cases where getElementById doesn't fit

[20:25:01] <matsaman> although for a freelancer in particular, you will pay more because they don't necessarily have the job security a firm's employees might
[20:25:10] <entuland> if you do that, console.log(props) will not be undefined, ___Rockwood__
[20:25:20] <entuland> but as above, I can't tell if that's how you're supposed to pass stuff there
[20:25:55] <matsaman> might get a better quality, though, but might not
[20:26:48] <___Rockwood__> Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {bar}). If you meant to render a collection of children, use an array instead.
[20:27:10] <entuland> but you _did_ get console.log() to work there, correct?
[20:27:20] <___Rockwood__> const MenuHandler = (props) => {
[20:27:20] <___Rockwood__>   console.log(props);
[20:27:53] <entuland> okay, now, the main point is that props wasn't accessible there because of ({props}), and that problem is now out of the way
[20:28:01] <wallbroken> I try to ask someone else
[20:28:07] <jaawerth> props is the object of props. if you nkow the name of the props, doing ({foo, bar}) is just doing regular object destructuring on the props object that gets passed in to function components
[20:28:08] <___Rockwood__> https://gist.github.com/Cyberiaaxis/53402520386bc9ac51df3f83dc4dc664
[20:28:11] <entuland> now read the error you got there and verify how you're supposed to pass stuff to that menu handler
[20:28:17] <jaawerth> if you're trying to render a property you need to render that property, not all the properties
[20:28:43] <jaawerth> based on the context, you probably want ({ bar }) => { }

[21:16:25] <GreenJello> austincheney, I don't think you can because querySelector only matches descendants
[21:16:38] <Donitz> "targetTouches: Like touches, but is filtered to only the information for finger touches that started out within the same node"

[21:17:33] <ThePendulum> Donitz: right, so you want a second touch not to do anything at all?
[21:17:42] <ThePendulum> thought that should just draw two lines
[21:17:54] <ThePendulum> hmmm
[21:18:21] <Donitz> yes, I think that's best
[21:18:27] <Donitz> not doing anything
[21:18:35] <Donitz> it's either that, or overriding the first touch with the second touch
[21:18:41] <Donitz> but I think it's better to just not have it do anything
[21:18:57] <ThePendulum> seems targetTouches might be quite useful here
[21:19:11] <Donitz> the entire drawing is just one single long line, which can be exported as a javascript array
[21:19:21] <Donitz> with cuts off course when you lift your finger
[21:19:24] <Donitz> of course*

[21:20:27] <Donitz> what happens if you release the first finger
[21:20:32] <Donitz> does the second finger become 0?
[21:20:35] <ThePendulum> it implies it will interrupt if you drag your finger across a div floating above your canvas
[21:20:44] *** Joins: comatory_ (~ondrejsyn@217.11.241.69)
[21:20:50] <ThePendulum> I would assume the first touch is 0 lol
[21:21:05] <ThePendulum> I would think the second touch has its own array
[21:21:16] <ThePendulum> so you need to use the information in the array to distinguish them
[21:21:23] <Donitz> targetTouches is already an array, with 0 being the first then
[21:21:27] <Donitz> and 1 being the second touch
[21:22:18] <Donitz> https://stackoverflow.com/a/7236327

[23:20:28] <jellobot> theskillwithin, window.fetch - a standard way to make HTTP requests, say bye to XHR and get a Promise http://mdn.io/Using_Fetch. For older browsers (IE*) see !polyfill
[23:20:57] <samsch> jokoon, await is a little like blocking, but more accurately it's like if everything that happens "after" it was moved into a .then() handler. xhr doesn't return a promise though, so you can't use await with it.

[23:59:05] <systemfault> Can't break the web.
[23:59:19] <Svitkona> the way to do it is to fire the promise and attach a listener (or a .then handler, or equivalent), and eg. show a dialogue to the user indicating that you're fetching data or whatever
