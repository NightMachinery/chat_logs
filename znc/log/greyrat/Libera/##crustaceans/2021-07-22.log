[13:43:04] <alyx> is such a huge part of the tech field really just brainless idiots

[13:50:01] <gerikson> lots of tech people are right-libertarians and fascination with "hard currencies" is a thing there
[13:50:53] <epilys> are you talking about USA libertarians?
[13:51:50] <epilys> most of the cryptocurrency folk I've met here are (neo)liberals
[13:52:43] <gerikson> distrust of governments, especially when it comes to "debasing the currency"
[13:53:11] <alyx> maybe i'm meeting the wrong folks but it feels like a lot of the cryptocurrency people i've met only really care about the "getting away from government currencies" aspect because it advances their "lol fuck yes this cryptocurrency is my big fucking daddy" agenda
[13:53:50] <gerikson> the real inflation in the crypto space is insane, as new coins are minted all the time
[13:54:04] <epilys> so are farts
[13:54:08] <gerikson> so it behooves for boosters to promote their coin as the "one true one"

[16:16:15] <gerikson> I'm reading that Julia multiple-dispatch thing
[16:16:37] <gerikson> and I figure the functionality is easily replicated using a hashtable in Perl
[16:16:42] <gerikson> what am i missing?
[16:18:26] <geoffwozniak> That's probably about right
[16:18:43] <gerikson> wait I guess i have to guard against unknown inputs
[16:18:58] <geoffwozniak> Multiple dispatch is essentially table lookup
[16:19:18] <geoffwozniak> That, however, is not very fast when you use it all the time
[16:25:46] <gerikson> https://gist.github.com/gustafe/5ad35552b8fafc93e3b9a6b14f9ea94f
[16:25:46] <buttsbot> Pokemon attacks in Perl · GitHub
[16:26:00] <gerikson> ok well i've learned a bit more
[16:31:18] <geoffwozniak> I did a little system of multiple dispatch in Lisp once where the predicates were general functions, not just types. That was fun.
[16:31:36] <geoffwozniak> I think you can even extend CLOS to do that pretty easily, as I recall
[16:31:53] <geoffwozniak> It will be slow, though
[16:31:54] <Geekingfrog> `push @types, 'clown';` <- wut ?
[16:32:41] <gerikson> Geekingfrog: that was to test the "unknown type" functionality
[16:33:27] <geoffwozniak> Finally got out with the telescope last night. Too much moon and ambient light for good views, but it was still enjoyable
[16:33:37] <gerikson> nice!
[16:33:47] <gerikson> summer is tough for stargazing I think
[16:33:52] <gerikson> too short nights
[16:34:01] <gerikson> damn you astronomical twilight
[16:38:59] <geoffwozniak> When we were up north camping it wasn't dark until about 11:30. So yeah, summer is a bit tougher, even though it has some great things to see
[16:39:37] <geoffwozniak> When the moon is less bright or not out, it's not so bad here.
[16:42:14] <gerikson> when the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie

[22:09:46] <gwozniak> Schools are definitely going to be in classroom here in September
[22:10:11] <gwozniak> As for in the office, I'm not sure what the status is
[22:23:04] <alyx> schools seem like they generally have so little choice in the matter
[22:23:14] <alyx> at least, primary schools
[22:24:39] <gwozniak> Pretty much everyone wants schools open in the fall here
[22:25:46] <alyx> here in iowa, govt's required schools to be at least 50% open since last year, and as of June mask mandates are banned
[22:26:50] <gwozniak> High schools, at least, will likely be requiring masks for at least the first half of the year
[22:27:16] <gwozniak> Not sure what will be happening in primary/elementary/middle schools
[22:32:33] <alyx> i should go invest in toilet paper stocks in advance
[22:32:45] <alyx> for when we have lockdown round idk: september edition
[22:32:55] <companion_cube> can people please get their shit together so I can travel in september :3
[22:46:30] <Brekkjern> The third world is a shitshow when it comes to covid, so no matter how much the west gets their shit together, we will still get imported cases and new outbreaks from them
[22:47:05] <Brekkjern> The quickest way to make things better is to support them with vaccines so it gets a lower chance to mutate into something new and worse
[23:15:03] <gerikson> I'm ok with that
[23:29:43] <gwozniak> Same here
[23:31:21] <gwozniak> goodger: how is arie doing? Still recovering well?
