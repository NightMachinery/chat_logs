[11:34:30] <gour> jindraj: well, i want it to work in both cases, iow, with opened/closed neomutt
[11:37:52] <gour> in order to have something like: Exec=claws-mail --select %u (*.desktop file), i need just some shell wrapper so i can invoke: neomuttwrapper %i to pass one of the above commands, right?
[11:38:38] <jindraj> then the same works for with opened neomutt the same. not depending whether the message is in the current mailbox or not. but instead <search> do <vfolder-from-query>.

[11:52:41] <dafna2[m]> it seems to not leave the while loop `while ((line = mutt_file_read_line(line, &linelen, fp, &lineno, MUTT_RL_CONT)) != NULL)` in `srouce_rc`
[11:55:09] <gahr> weird
[11:55:26] <gahr> does this mean mutt_file_read_line doesn't return, or it always returns the same line?
[11:55:42] <gahr> (also, I assume "mutt" means "neomutt" here?)
[11:57:03] <dafna2[m]> on my rc file I have the `mailboxes` defined to be my imap server, it is stuck on that line
[11:57:33] <dafna2[m]> `mailboxes imaps://mail.bla.com/`
[11:58:42] <dafna2[m]> it's weird since it does not seem related to the -Q option
[11:59:03] <dafna2[m]> but without the -Q option it runs fine
[12:07:18] <gahr> ah wait
[12:08:11] <gahr> when you run without -Q, does it prompt for a password?
[12:11:04] <gahr> cause it looks like -Q turns on OptNoCurses, which interferes with how we prompt for usernames/passwords etc

[15:14:41] <gahr> hi flatcap 
[15:15:51] <gahr> flatcap: I wanted to ask you about #3220.. an alternative approach would be to detect OptNoCurses in dlg_verify_certificate and just return foobar

[15:16:22] <flatcap> hi gahr 
[15:16:31] <gahr> I think we're a bit inconsistent on the layer on which we try to handle OptNoCurses

[15:16:38] <flatcap> yeah, very
[15:16:44] <gahr> yeah that's fine, unless you preferred the other approach :)
[15:17:06] <flatcap> that'll do nicely
[15:17:33] <flatcap> we can have a longer think about how OptNoCurses should be implemented

[15:17:44] <flatcap> ok, good
[15:20:10] <jindraj> gour: the transform-tags works only for %g expando of index_format. it doesn't affect `Tags` header in pager if you `unignore` the header.

[16:29:16] <dcpurton> hmmm
[16:29:23] <dcpurton> <Tab> seems like a bad keycode
[16:30:13] <flatcap> Ctrl-A is ASCII 0x01, Ctrl-I is ASCII 0x09 (i.e. <Tab>)
[16:30:41] <flatcap> yeah, it's less memorable as <tab> than <ctrl-I>
[16:31:01] <dcpurton> plus, <Tab> might be expected to do something different
[16:31:09] <dcpurton> either now or in the future
[16:31:16] <flatcap> is <Alt-I> in use?
[16:31:23] <flatcap> good point
[16:31:52] <dcpurton> I don't think so
[16:32:03] <dcpurton> but the default keybindings don't seem to use Alt
[16:32:36] <flatcap> <Alt-X> appears as <Esc-X>
[16:32:42] <dcpurton> ooo
[16:32:48] <dcpurton> that's good to know
[16:32:56] <flatcap> <edit-from> is <esc-f> (<Alt-f>)
[16:32:56] <dcpurton> all this time I've been pressing <esc>
[16:33:22] <flatcap> (I think it might work as Cmd-F in Macs)
[16:33:57] <flatcap> it's on my todo list to accept <Alt-X> in bindings and display <Alt-X> to the user
[16:34:13] <flatcap> (they don't care that <esc> is inserted by ncurses :-)
[16:34:55] <dcpurton> ok. I'll switch it to Alt+I
[16:35:03] <flatcap> cool
[16:38:45] <flatcap> fyi: there are similar problems with Ctrl-J / Ctrl-M / <enter> / <return>
[16:43:36] <dcpurton> ah, right
[16:44:37] <dcpurton> I notice they seem to be generally mapped to the same thing
[16:44:57] <dcpurton> and it's the kind of thing the <enter> makes sense for
[16:45:02] <flatcap> yeah
[16:45:03] <dcpurton> so not so noticable
[17:12:46] <dcpurton> flatcap: I wonder if it's worth merging devel/multipart-related without further feature changes?
[17:13:04] <dcpurton> The basic building blocks for creating such a group are present
[17:14:18] <flatcap> yes, probably
[17:14:26] <dcpurton> and the changes required to simplify composing these messages are more invasive
[17:15:02] <flatcap> I'll have a think and a re-read of the code
[17:26:15] <dcpurton> Night
[17:26:19] <dcpurton> bed time here
[17:26:29] <flatcap> night dcpurton
