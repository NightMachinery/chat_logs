[00:00:10] <mixfix41> it looks like the creator of the text editor jove is from toronto a fellow canuck
[00:00:33] <Sapphirus> there's a lot of canucks in here
[00:00:41] <mixfix41> im not
[00:00:52] <mixfix41> im in the midwest where it snows it almost counts
[00:01:11] <mixfix41> basically the same weather patterns as toronto
[00:01:18] <mixfix41> their trees are darker
[00:01:38] <Sapphirus> i like how you think Toronto is the only place that exists on this side of the border
[00:01:43] <Sapphirus> ah, wonderful.
[00:01:55] <Sapphirus> üòú
[00:02:11] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: as we know, the only cities canada has is toronto and vancouver
[00:02:46] <mixfix41> haha excuse my ignorance
[00:02:47] <HeTo> uh, someone decided to make another terminal emulator with the name congruent with http://www.9bis.net/kitty/#!index.md modulo case?
[00:02:49] <ImoutoBot> [title] KiTTY
[00:03:04] <HeTo> did they just want to be confusing or had they really not heard of that?
[00:10:49] <MootPoot> I still dont really 'get' how the drive mounting system works though
[00:10:52] <mixfix41> american way is inter province road trip coast to coast
[00:10:56] <Sapphirus> KiTTY existed before kitty
[00:10:57] <mixfix41> to learn more
[00:10:58] <MootPoot> so it only ever shows you your own drive
[00:11:06] <MootPoot> but if you automount another or something
[00:11:57] <MootPoot> you should put it in a subfolder within your /mnt ?
[00:12:12] <mixfix41> no you can mount anything anywhere
[00:12:21] <MootPoot> should, not could
[00:12:28] <mixfix41> no really you can
[00:12:32] <MootPoot> should, not could
[00:12:36] <mixfix41> nfs is network file system
[00:12:44] <Bco1981> should not, but could
[00:12:45] <mixfix41> definitely meaning abilities
[00:13:07] <mixfix41> it could be across network not just a thumbdrive even
[00:13:33] <HeTo> /mnt is supposed to be the directory for a temporary mount, it's not supposed to have subdirectories, although there are some old Linux distros mistaken about this
[00:13:38] <mixfix41> i got it from linux reality chess griffin mentions it
[00:14:21] <HeTo> removable storage is typically mounted under /media, but it's typically managed by udisks or something so that you don't need root permissions etc.
[00:15:27] <HeTo> within the regular file system you can put stuff on different file systems pretty freely. e.g. put /home on a separate partition so that if you reinstall the OS you can keep your home directory
[00:16:06] <MootPoot> ah
[00:16:07] <MootPoot> ok
[00:16:07] <HeTo> or put /var on a separate partition so that if it fills up with temporary or cached files or the like / won't be out of space as well
[00:16:10] <MootPoot> that makes sense
[00:16:20] * MootPoot should create a /media folder then
[00:17:45] <Bco1981> just like you do on a windows, don't keep your games, pictures, documents, videos, music on your windows partition. so you can just reinstall when you want to.
[00:21:55] <Satin> brub
[00:21:57] <Satin> briht
[00:21:59] <Satin> bruh
[00:22:05] <Bco1981> you good?
[00:22:08] <Satin> my wifi went down completely
[00:22:28] <Satin> and my cell signal wasn't working so i drove out a bit before i got any internet
[00:22:30] <Satin> wtf man
[00:22:52] <Satin> *also got a cheeseburger, bunless while I was at it, 2g carbs
[00:23:32] <Satin> if the internet doesn't come back up my entire routine for the day is messed up smh
[00:24:59] <Bco1981> you can't get a wired connection?
[00:25:27] <HeTo> you have a laptop. just drive where you have Internet, park and use the Internet
[00:25:35] <HeTo> at least until your charge runs out
[00:28:50] <Satin> i don't have infinite data
[00:29:05] <Bco1981> irc don't take that much
[00:29:15] <Satin> it has nothing to do with wired connection or not tho
[00:29:28] <Satin> lmao Bco1981 
[00:29:50] <Bco1981> you complain about wifi... then the obvious answer is... go wired
[00:30:00] <Bco1981> wifi stinks
[00:30:10] <Bco1981> and is only for tablets and phones
[00:30:42] <Satin> ok i think it's working again
[00:30:43] <Sapphirus> yes
[00:30:44] <Satin> test
[00:30:52] <mixfix41> newer laptops are equip with 5g with a modern Access Point you can get 300+ mb download  a second
[00:31:19] <Bco1981> it's not only the laptop it depends on.
[00:31:26] <mixfix41> which is the same as the phone so possibly faster? if the NIC is good quality (better than phone 5g nic)
[00:31:26] <Satin> ok  i'm back :D
[00:31:32] <Sapphirus> wired isn't intermittent when the spectrum is crowded with loads of other aps
[00:31:35] <mixfix41> thats why i say modern access point
[00:31:44] <MootPoot> mixfix41: I have no idea what you're saying
[00:31:55] <Bco1981> the quality of your accesspoint, the interference in your house/area.
[00:32:01] <Sapphirus> 5ghz is also doesn't penetrate walls very well
[00:32:05] <Satin> but the wifi wasn't the problem
[00:32:05] * MootPoot accesses Bco1981's point
[00:32:07] <Bco1981> if you want a stabile connection. wired.
[00:32:11] <Sapphirus> ^^
[00:32:19] <Satin> it was the internet itself
[00:32:25] <Satin> network status or whatever
[00:32:32] <Sapphirus> shit isp
[00:32:36] <Bco1981> ^
[00:32:43] <mixfix41> well im talking about ubiquit access point, so these can be bought with more and more demand as you migrate over to 5g this is known in the 5g world cause i just set my first one up
[00:32:47] <Sapphirus> residential isps are the worst

[00:33:21] <Bco1981> ugh

[00:34:27] <mixfix41> its interesting nonetheless, cause before i couldnt use my chromecast outside and , in theory, now i can
[00:34:28] <Sapphirus> mixfix41, sure, but you can't beat a wired connection when it comes to capacity and stability. Doesn't matter how many APs you throw at it.

[09:24:34] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: Japanese call cola "juice" too
[09:25:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'm a lot less certain on what makes juice.
[09:25:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> My first thought was "any sugary fluid" but it's probably not that. 
[09:25:47] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: in the West juice usually comes from fruits
[09:26:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yeah. But synthetic juices are a thing and called juice there too.
[09:26:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So it has to be something else.

[14:44:57] <Bco1981> Cryowolf: just remember those big tv's you don't really move them alone. Yeah it does not weigh much, so sure you could... but it's so big you will most like damage it by banging it into something when you move it.
[14:45:06] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, if you're happy with it that's good
[14:45:18] <Bco1981> likely*
[14:45:44] <Cryowolf> Bco1981, I moved and installed it using physics to my advantage without damaging myself or the tv and this while I'm injured
[14:46:13] <mixfix41> actually table buildings do it solo you just need to be determine
[14:46:26] <Cryowolf> pivoting between different heights using pillows to support the edges etc
[14:46:28] <mixfix41> they dont scratch the tables they work with
[14:46:57] <Cryowolf> so I got it up no problem

[14:56:56] <mixfix41> oh no i thought you might have affiliates
[14:57:16] <Cryowolf> but using physics to my advantage didnt require much strength, only planning
[14:58:01] <Cryowolf> pivoting a tv and sliding it with the pillow you placed the pivot on until it hits the foot, then repeat, and it's there
[14:58:28] <Cryowolf> got it up there with no damage and if there had been damage...well I'd get a new tv cause Ive got full insurance which includes "being clumsy"
[14:58:47] <mixfix41> insurance is $$$ i always skip insurance

[17:24:25] <darkwitch> phenyl ethyl alcohol is the largest part of the rose smell, but it will be rather sad alone, so you add things like citronellol and geraniol to make it closer to the real thing
[17:24:33] <omero> added to make the perfume strong 
[17:25:12] <darkwitch> three is not really enough either, so there are lots of other candidates to make it smell more realistic

[18:06:34] <amigojapan> Let me see TsundereNoises 
[18:06:44] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: so what I was trying to figure out is if "brown" has a different cultural meaning, or if google is just being a dick
[18:06:45] <KatrinValerie> My GP is still on holiday till next week q.q
[18:07:14] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I notice at least some of the yellow cats don't have Ëå∂Ëâ≤ in their title at least, but I didn't go through them all
[18:07:33] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: what does Google do with brown cat in English?
[18:07:45] <TsundereNoises> morning KatrinValerie, my link to amigo contains cats
[18:08:14] <amigojapan> Hi KatrinValerie 
[18:08:23] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: https://www.moepantsu.com/benises/qgmiko.png

[18:08:29] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: which is what I'd expected
[18:08:43] <TsundereNoises> you do have a random grey cat in there, but only one
[18:09:01] <KatrinValerie> TsundereNoises: Nyaa I know
[18:09:09] <KatrinValerie> Because I am cat
[18:09:09] <amigojapan> And Siamese cats
[18:09:25] <TsundereNoises> KatrinValerie: you monitor all our traffic for cat-related images?
[18:09:38] <KatrinValerie> TsundereNoises: no, I just instantly clicked that link
[18:09:48] <KatrinValerie> Because cat related content is what keeps me alive
[18:09:59] <KatrinValerie> If I wasn't allergic I would own a cat
[18:10:19] <TsundereNoises> I just assume when I'm asking amigo a dumb japanese question, people who don't care don't click it
[18:10:21] <KatrinValerie> Pharao cats are too expensive
[18:10:26] <TsundereNoises> yeah, I'm really glad to have a cat
[18:10:41] <KatrinValerie> I am allergic to all the good companion animals
[18:10:41] <TsundereNoises> that'd be an allergy I would definitely have trouble with
[18:10:50] <KatrinValerie> Even birbs are off the list
[18:10:54] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: maybe brown cars are rare in Japan
[18:11:13] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I have a hard time believing that's the explanation
[18:11:20] <KatrinValerie> I love what auto correct did there 
[18:11:41] <amigojapan> Then what's the explanation? TsundereNoises 
[18:11:44] <KatrinValerie> TsundereNoises: Orange is almost brown, the AI can't tell the difference because of the stripes

[18:11:59] <KatrinValerie> Overfitting issue could be there too
[18:12:08] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: well as I said, it could be a google thing, but some degree of it must be linguistic, which is what I was trying to figure out
[18:12:24] <KatrinValerie> TsundereNoises: It is very plausible that the algorithm does not know how to consider that specific colour
[18:12:32] <amigojapan> Ok TsundereNoises 
[18:12:50] <KatrinValerie> TsundereNoises: maybe different meaning in kantonese or mandarin
[18:12:53] <TsundereNoises> KatrinValerie: you think the algorithm is actually doing picture matching? I was under the impression it worked off words in the pages around the titular cats?
[18:13:10] <TsundereNoises> hence the random grey one (and always having some random image that's off, but the right text appears on the relevant page)
[18:13:37] <KatrinValerie> TsundereNoises: meta data and also AI mapping from man made training sets
[18:13:54] <TsundereNoises> KatrinValerie: that's the beauty of using „ÅÆ
[18:14:03] <TsundereNoises> shouldn't be any chinese results
[18:14:29] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: I tried Ëå∂Ëâ≤„ÅÑÁå´ got similar results
[18:14:29] <TsundereNoises> KatrinValerie: but yeah, different meanings in chinese languages are a common problem with these searches, you learn to use kana to exclude china
[18:14:56] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: how about Ëå∂Ëâ≤„ÅÑÁä¨?
[18:14:58] *** Quits: sneeder (~sneeder@c-68-82-201-176.hsd1.pa.comcast.net) (Quit: Leaving)
[18:15:07] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: so I think some of it MAY be google being fuzzier than it should be, but there has got to be something language-related going on
[18:16:30] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: interesting, the dogs you get average a bit lighter than "brown dog" but I don't see any golden retrievers or anything 
[18:16:44] <TsundereNoises> oh, I do see one, but he's at least on the darker end
[18:16:48] <TsundereNoises> lots of shibas
[18:16:54] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: seems they are more brown than the cats
[18:17:20] <TsundereNoises> yeah
[18:17:26] <TsundereNoises> but "brown dog" does tend darker
[18:17:39] <amigojapan> Ok
[18:17:57] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: so I feel like this is evidence that there's a bit of an "Èùí„ÅÑ" type issue

[18:18:57] <TsundereNoises> KatrinValerie: what counts as a brown dog/cat in german?
[18:19:39] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: in Spanish perro cafe is brown dog
[18:19:59] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: and gato cafe is brown cat
[18:20:54] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: maybe I should learn spanish, seems like they have good taste in beverages
[18:20:58] * TsundereNoises chugs coffee
[18:21:18] <amigojapan> Lol TsundereNoises 
[18:21:52] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: realistically there's a relatively small number of things I'm aware of that I want to read in Spanish that don't have good translations, so it's not high on my priority list
[18:22:31] <darkwitch> dip a white cat in coffee to make it a brown cat
[18:22:33] <amigojapan> Alright TsundereNoises 
[18:22:46] <amigojapan> Lol darkwitch 
[18:22:46] <TsundereNoises> darkwitch: my cat likes to stick her nose in my coffee
[18:23:11] <amigojapan> darkwitch: not if it is transparent coffee
[18:23:23] <darkwitch> I'm afraid the color with quickly wash out anyway
[18:23:53] <darkwitch> amigojapan, transparent coffee was a failure
[18:24:17] <ButterNoodle> pepsi clear
[18:24:41] <amigojapan> As was transparent Pepsi, but everyone remembers it darkwitch 
[18:25:31] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: I think we had a Coca-Cola clear in Japan
[18:25:35] <TsundereNoises> it's important to remember our failures
[18:25:51] <darkwitch> so we can fail better the next time?
[18:25:54] <amigojapan> Like more recently
[18:25:55] <TsundereNoises> exactly
[18:26:52] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: you know darkwitch wants to make pink coffee

[18:36:43] <TsundereNoises> you could just be minding your own business, and suddenly get attacked by a random brown dog, only people within earshot are spanish-speakers, but they think you mean a pink dog because they've been drinking your coffee
[18:36:53] <TsundereNoises> you have to consider these kind of contingencies

[18:48:35] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: so you think the yellow cats are kind of weird to your intuition too, right?
[18:48:56] <amigojapan> Yea TsundereNoises 
[18:49:13] <analoq> i think grinding them on demand is the whole point, otherwise why bother with grinding at all?
[18:49:21] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: the fresher the better, but I often grind coffee for tomorrow so I don't have to grind anything when I'm half asleep and haven't had any coffee yet
[18:49:41] <TsundereNoises> analoq: because coffee you ground yesterday is way better than coffee you ground 2 weeks ago
[18:49:48] <MootPoot> I'm wondering how much coffee I can feasibly grind and take with me if I'm gone for a while 
[18:49:59] <MootPoot> maybe like a week tops
[18:50:03] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: I mean, it's not like it goes bad, just the quality slowly decreases
[18:50:25] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: just grind a week and live with it, it'll still be much better than hotel coffee
[18:50:34] <MootPoot> they dont like - do some fancy shit to preground coffee it make it last longer?
[18:50:39] <TsundereNoises> no
[18:50:50] <analoq> the question is how long does it take until it becomes indistinguishable from preground coffee?
[18:50:58] <TsundereNoises> more than a week
[18:51:17] <analoq> well they package it in a vacuum, which i guess is a little fancy?
[18:51:24] <Bco1981> MootPoot: 8K 480hz...
[18:51:42] <Bco1981> do that even exist?
[18:51:42] <MootPoot> 1bit color?
[18:51:45] <Bco1981> lol
[18:52:00] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: I drank some heavy whipping cream
[18:52:02] <TsundereNoises> yeah but how often are you drinking pre-ground coffee from a freshly opened bag (also a lot of it isn't done in a vacuum, at least here
[18:52:10] <MootPoot> idk, highest I know is at like 4k 240hz from that yet-to-be-released samsung monitor
[18:52:16] <darkwitch> also nitrogen instead of vacuum
[18:52:39] <TsundereNoises> last time I bought pre-ground coffee they just ground it and poured it into a bag
[18:52:56] <TsundereNoises> and it was much better than grocery store shit, because that's how you get pre-ground coffee from actual coffee roasters
[18:53:18] <TsundereNoises> it was still a lot better a few weeks later, but less good than freshly ground
[18:53:20] <darkwitch> same here. it would also likely be a paper bag
[18:53:38] <amigojapan> darkwitch: I got no reply on my idea
[18:53:54] <darkwitch> amigojapan, sorry what was the idea?
[18:53:55] <TsundereNoises> point being, just grind a week and don't worry about it, you don't need to live your life around perfectly optimal coffee MootPoot
[18:54:06] <analoq> idk i dont like home made coffee, now these supermarket coffee drinks those i dig. no idea what they do differently though
[18:54:27] <amigojapan> darkwitch: you make the strawberry water. Then add caffeine
[18:55:05] <amigojapan> darkwitch: bypass coffee all together
[18:55:06] <darkwitch> amigojapan, that's not good. it still needs to taste like coffee
[18:55:17] <TsundereNoises> I hate how, when you're driving late at night, it's almost impossible to get canned coffee that isn't full of sweeteners
[18:55:18] <darkwitch> the caffeine is not the important part

[23:21:38] <MootPoot> unfortunate
[23:21:53] <MootPoot> I just had to give DHL my ID so they can send me my keyboard
[23:21:57] <emmeka> I'm just being shuffled around to do shit. Including... the most Canadian job ever
[23:22:06] <emmeka> I am apparently going to be trained to drive a zamboni
[23:22:08] <MootPoot> snow ploughing?
[23:22:11] <MootPoot> close enough

[23:22:36] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: it tells me I'm not pregnant
[23:22:42] <MootPoot> I guess I need to sex more for a week
[23:22:48] <emmeka> for the municipal arena, because somehow sports leagues = exempt from lockdown
[23:23:46] <JesseDesu> emmeka how hard is beeswax
[23:23:54] <ButterNoodle> u know.. its funny u say that.. anything that makes money for big business or government is exempt from lockdown
[23:23:59] <JesseDesu> i need to use some to seal an airbrush thread
[23:24:02] <emmeka> JesseDesu uhhh not very, why
[23:24:13] <emmeka> when warmed it's a liquid
[23:24:15] <JesseDesu> i wonder why beeswax is recommended
[23:24:48] <MootPoot> they use beeswax to lube the 22lr eley rounds I buy
[23:24:55] <emmeka> you do airbrushing?
[23:25:26] <MootPoot> emmeka: well, come the end of this month I WILL be unemployed, although given how many interview requests I'm getting, I dont think I need to worry
[23:25:43] <emmeka> it's pretty hard to be unemployed in these days of labour shortages
[23:25:49] <emmeka> takes real commitment to the NEET ethos
[23:26:01] <HeTo> emmeka: is there live audience for the sports?
[23:26:14] <emmeka> HeTo no, apparently, now
[23:26:27] <MootPoot> but here's to hoping I get a solid pay boost
[23:26:31] <MootPoot> to like 60k or something
[23:26:34] <MootPoot> maybe even 70
[23:26:43] * MootPoot wallows in 32k

[23:27:05] <HeTo> well, I don't know how deep your lockdown is, but it makes sense that professional sports leagues aren't banned
[23:27:13] <emmeka> MootPoot negotiating a salary is a game that takes practice and under no circumstances should you just accept what is offered to you right now

[23:28:58] <emmeka> employers do weaselly shit like ask you for a range of expected salary and then come in with an offer at the low end of that, don't buy it. Hard counteroffer. Do it towards the end of an interview, but make sure it's discussed *before* commitment to accept the job.
[23:29:45] <MootPoot> I had all the naitvete blasted out of me with how garbage that first internship was
[23:31:12] <MootPoot> I forgot how hard it is to coordiate two hands on the same task
[23:31:13] <MootPoot> jesus
[23:31:21] <MootPoot> two handed piano playing
[23:31:41] <MootPoot> emmeka: Right now I'm kind of in the "playing hardball" mindset
[23:31:45] <Bco1981> yeah, i doubt beat saber skills help there.

[23:31:58] <emmeka> MootPoot it's a good mindset, for the current market.
[23:32:31] <emmeka> there's a labour shortage, employers need to compete for workers, but somehow they haven't gotten the memo
[23:32:46] <emmeka> so often you end up having to hardball the competitiveness into them
[23:33:05] <MootPoot> I have a interview this thursday and I think another one maybe next week - haven't setup a time yet
[23:34:39] <MootPoot> when is tax refund season again?

[23:35:50] <Urchin[emacs]> it's the current state of the art in negotiation theory
