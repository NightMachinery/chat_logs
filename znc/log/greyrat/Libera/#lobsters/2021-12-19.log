[01:03:18] <momcorp> I disagree with the idea that programmers forgot how to use shell and Unix. I've been coding for 30 years and the shell was always a niche around me. Also you can still use it for most daily tasks.
[01:06:29] <c355E3B> I'm running into a large number of developers who haven't really understood the Unix process model.

[03:11:45] <iDrougge> technomancy: I think multiple return values do, in a few cases, make sense.
[03:12:11] <c355E3B> I'm fine with multi-return IIF I have pattern matching
[03:13:53] <iDrougge> It enables certain mathematical operations that may give both a return value and an overflow condition, or the result of a division as well as its remainder.
[03:13:59] <ngoldbaum> c355E3B: so python 3.10 is your friend? :p
[03:14:04] <c355E3B> No
[03:14:15] <c355E3B> I have a long history of being abused by Python
[03:14:26] <c355E3B> Also, people need to stop sending me *screenshots* of stack traces
[03:16:32] <imode> c355E3B: just do what I (finally) did: make the local setup spin up a socat-based TCP server that serves you 5k lines of log scrollback.
[03:16:46] <c355E3B> I wish I could do taht
[03:16:47] <imode> now if someone wants to come complaining of a problem, they just give me their desktop's internal URL.
[03:16:47] <c355E3B> *that
[03:16:58] <imode> provided you have their desktop address, you kinda can.
[03:16:59] <c355E3B> must most of the issues I have are on customer systems
[03:17:04] <imode> blech.
[03:17:13] <imode> outside of the company I take it.
[03:17:17] <c355E3B> Yeah
[03:17:25] <c355E3B> I'm pushing more agent code next week to try to help with some of it
[03:17:34] <c355E3B> but the general issue is that t1 doesn't fucking get what I need
[03:17:42] <c355E3B> so the customers get pissed off and *I* have to deal with it.
[03:17:56] <c355E3B> Do you really want me to talk to our big accounts? Really Support?
[03:18:02] <ngoldbaum> c355E3B: screenshots of the top half of a tracceback in a jupyter notebook
[03:18:25] <imode> ngoldbaum: camera shots of it work better.
[03:18:35] <imode> just funnel it all through google translate and we're golden.

[03:20:09] <imode> gotta include a company watermark.
[03:21:48] <c355E3B> I like when the email system strips the attachments before it gets to our support portal
[03:21:57] <c355E3B> because there is source code in it
[03:22:15] <ngoldbaum> i really truly think having a class where someone teaches you how to debug things would be far more valuable than more than half of the engineering curriculum writ large
[03:22:45] <ngoldbaum> just the amount of wasted energy because people don’t know how to think analytically about broken things
[03:22:53] <c355E3B> Isn't that home-ec/industrial arts?
[03:23:48] <ngoldbaum> the reason people do shit like send you a screenshot of a traceback is they don’t have the faintest clue what to do if a program doesn’t work for whatever reason

[13:00:46] <jmiven> I don't know what's so enticing with inventing stuff about Go
[13:03:01] <teiresias> Java forces OO, and Go doesn't really have OO per se.  Well, their are composition and interfaces, but no inheritance of implementation.  The similarity is that both are really meant for fungible commoditized programmers in corporate environments.  I kinda like Go and think it has its place.  Maybe so does Java.
[13:03:16] <teiresias>   But the infamous Rob Pike quote is a pretty good summary of the Go designers' opinion of their target audience.
[13:04:43] <jmiven> yeah but they do write software in Go. So they are also part of their "target audience"...
[13:05:11] <jmiven> and by software, I mean side-projects, not Google stuff.
[13:05:51] <teiresias> It's a good point.  Do Pike and Thompson though?
[13:06:52] <jmiven> I don't know about Thompson, but Pike definitely does

[19:36:32] <mockturtle> [ In the words of Rob Pike: “The key point here is our programmers are Googlers, t... | Hacker News ] - news.ycombinator.com
[19:38:29] <fridim> thanks, makes sense
[19:38:34] <teiresias> fridim: Yep, "The key point here is our programmers are Googlers, they’re not researchers.  They're typically, fairly young, fresh out of school, probably learned Java, maybe learned C or C++, probably learned Python. They're not capable of understanding a brilliant language but we want to use them to build good software. So, the language that we give them has to be easy for them to understand and easy to adopt."
[19:39:03] <teiresias> The elitism drips.
[19:41:10] <kline> teiresias, my fave rsc quote is the "what you see as a kludge i see as elegant design" when it comes to having 3 different meaningful comment syntaxes
[19:42:21] <gerikson> elitism, or realism
[19:42:41] <gerikson> teiresias: in other threads "jfc people with CS degrees simply cannot program at all"
[19:43:32] <kline> gerikson, i dont think that generally has anything to do with programming languages though, it tends to be a problem with programmatic thinking
[19:44:05] <teiresias> I think EWD warned us about Java schools...
[19:44:09] <kline> CS grads know how to drive python, java, etc just fine, but outside of very clearly bounded coursework questions they arent about of looking at a problem and breaking it down into a solution that fits how computers work
[19:44:21] <gerikson> ok here's my take: maybe 15% of humans are ok with programming
[19:44:23] <kline> s/about of/able to
[19:44:50] <gerikson> of those, maybe 10% learn more than one language (or language class, i.e. OO vs FP)
[19:45:03] <ngoldbaum> a lot of CS assignments you turn in after running the test suite the prof wrote to check your work
[19:45:06] <gerikson> and of those, maybe 10% acheive enlightement where it is all one
[19:45:08] <kline> gerikson, i dont really disagree with you, but "CS grads cant program" doesnt imply "CS grads arent capable of understanding a brilliant programming language"
[19:45:15] <ngoldbaum> and of course you’re writing it by yourself
[19:45:31] <ngoldbaum> approximately zero real-world professional programming is like that
[19:45:49] <ngoldbaum> and people wonder where the write-only code comes from
[19:45:50] <gerikson> I think people wildly overestimate how smart pople who work at google are
[19:46:26] <gerikson> Pike works there, he has no illusions
[19:47:09] *** Joins: alex11 (~alex11@user/alex11)
[19:47:12] <gerikson> code is more than expressibility, it's maintainability, trainability, etc etc
[19:47:35] <gerikson> doesn't matter if Go has boilerplate as long as it's the same boilerplate
[19:47:57] <gerikson> people built billion-dollar corporations on top of COBOL, an objectively horrible language

[19:49:58] <kline> im mostly sad that go had an opportunity to fix so many things in the niche that it sits, but chose to make the same mistakes all over again
[19:50:18] <riv> what mistakes?
[19:50:31] <riv> also which niche?
[19:50:31] <gerikson> that just shows that the powers that be wanted a better C
[19:50:33] <gerikson> nothing else
[19:50:41] <gerikson> *at Google
[19:50:52] <gerikson> and they ddin't want Java
[19:51:33] <kline> like, python/c-like imperative language for writing network stuff, there are a few languages there, but then they used the weakest possible implementation of CSP, terrible implementation of stuff around interaces, generics bad, and not picking literally any better way of handling error codes

[19:52:28] <kline> not improving the error handling model is probably the most egregious, but how it does goroutines and channels is the one that irks me worst, having seen it done better in erlang and groovy+jcsp
[19:52:39] <riv> There are some parts of CSP missing?

[19:53:07] <kline> also, the multiple formats of meaningful-comments thing, thats really dumb as well
[19:53:15] <kline> gerikson, concurrent sequential processes
[19:53:55] <kline> the academic model which is based on the idea of multiple routines being swapped in in sequence and communicating usually via some kind of channel-like interface
[19:54:06] <gerikson> look, Plan 9 is the apothoesis of system design, just accept it
