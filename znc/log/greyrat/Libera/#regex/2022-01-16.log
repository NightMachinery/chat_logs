[16:53:04] <ham5urg> I have a regex like https://regex101.com/r/aK0z71/1 . I need to transform a matching string to something like ^\d{1,10}[,]\d{2}$ with python3's re . If I use re.match.groups Idk how to handle the repeating groups. What is a good way to transform a matching string?

[16:56:18] <digitok> https://regex101.com/r/aK0z71/2 can you update this by replacing the @s with appropriate values
[16:56:33] <digitok> and click update regex
[17:07:04] <ham5urg> digitok, I had a mistake in the regex which I changed. I added the before/after examples. https://regex101.com/r/aK0z71/4
[17:09:05] <digitok> i assume "01" for the first "after" example is just a typo
[17:12:39] <digitok> like this? https://regex101.com/r/aK0z71/5

[17:24:57] <ham5urg> digitok, yes, I made a typo. Your substitution is correct. How could a repeating 2nd group be handled by Python?
[17:25:07] *** Joins: src (~src@user/src)
[17:25:32] <ham5urg> is it re.match.group(3) ? I try.
[17:48:28] <digitok> repeating groups is not so straightforward. you could capture the part before , including the .'s and then remove them after
[17:49:43] <digitok> although come to think of it, could you not just ensure the format is correct and then strip - and . ?
[17:50:37] <digitok> or at least just the .'s
[17:51:26] <digitok> something like https://regex101.com/r/aK0z71/6
[17:51:34] <ham5urg> Ah, yes, that would be a way too.
[17:51:47] <digitok> and then re.match.group(1).replace(".", "")
