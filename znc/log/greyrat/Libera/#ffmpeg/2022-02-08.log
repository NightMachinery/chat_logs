[01:24:36] <furq> amongst many other things

[04:51:55] <nicolas17> hi, I downloaded a video from Twitch, and I was horrified to discover that the .mp4 can be significantly compressed with gzip (26% of the original)
[04:52:15] <nicolas17> there seems to be long runs of 0xFF bytes in the binary file
[04:53:38] *** Joins: milkt (~debian@gateway/tor-sasl/milkt)
[04:54:19] <kepstin> that kinda makes sense, twitch stuff is designed for live broadcast and to avoid issues with tcp adjusting to different transfer rates they suggest using cbr modes. In modern video codecs, undershoot of cbr bitrate is handled by padding.
[04:55:21] <DHE> confirmed, a ~4 GB video file from twitch can be gzip'd to around 3.5 GB
[04:55:59] <nicolas17> I got 4.6GB -> 3.4GB on a different Twitch video (different streamer, different codec settings and amount of movement)
[04:56:09] <kepstin> i suspect it depends a lot on stream content, yeah.
[04:56:15] <nicolas17> but this first one was 1.8GB -> 481MB
[04:56:40] <DHE> yeah, static images compress really well and would invoke a lot of compression..
[04:56:50] <DHE> *padding
[04:57:01] <nicolas17> this implies that compressing with a very high quality crf may still end up with a smaller file, but is there any way I could get rid of the padding losslessly?
[04:57:21] <kepstin> yes, that should be possible. I think one of the ffmpeg bsfs can do that?

[05:07:42] <kepstin> if there's a lot of static images, it's theoretically possible that identical keyframes might be repeated?

[05:08:07] <furq> that much is feasible for way too high cbr
[05:08:39] <nicolas17> it's a programming stream, so text editor + small camera thumbnail, I'm sure the CBR was set way higher than justified

[17:27:54] <BtbN> ffmpeg is not responsible for your kernels drivers, indeed
[17:28:02] <BtbN> if v4l works, ffmpeg will be able to access it

[19:16:18] <kepstin> audio and video are recorded using separate interfaces. with the ffmpeg cli tool specifically, it first opens one interface then the other, so if one is slow to initialize that can cause a desync.
[19:16:55] <kepstin> (better programs can attempt to open both simultaneously or try to resync the streams somehow, but ffmpeg cli tool doesn't have code to do that)

[21:25:33] <DHE> Polochon_street: it's typically fine as long as you're not modifying the contents of the packet yourself. ref/unref are based on sharing the storage of the payload itself so you need to treat the packet as read-only or use the proper procedures to ensure writing is safe
[21:27:11] <Polochon_street> okay, so it's not really a good idea to consider it as cloned :D
[21:27:27] <Polochon_street> is there no way to clone a packet then? Or did I miss something?

[22:01:18] <kepstin> as far as it goes, there is an "av_packet_make_writable()" function that turns a possibly-shared (should be considered read-only) packet to an unshared packet by copying data if needed.
[22:03:37] *** Quits: Volgaar (~volgaar@147.94.11.104) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[22:11:10] <Polochon_street> so, doing an av_packet_ref and an av_packet_make_writable should do the trick, right? I'm just implementing the Clone method in some bindings, so I think the caller of the Clone method assumes the packet is absolutely not shared
[22:11:14] <Polochon_street> like, it should be a new, "fresh" copy
[22:11:53] <Polochon_street> ... or I could just use `av_packet_clone`

[22:47:32] <prg> Does anyone know of a way to convert a single image to a video in ffmpeg?  I'm looking to convert a single image to about a 30 second video (that will be used in a DVD menu)..  I've tried 'ffmpeg -f image2 -i myimage.jpg output.mp4' but I can't seem to figure out how to tell ffmpeg to make this 30 seconds long.  Does anyone have any ideas?  I've tried messing around with -vframes, but that doesn't
[22:47:34] <prg> seem to make it any longer
[22:48:14] <prg> I know I can easily do this in openshot or something but ideally I'd like to do it with ffmpeg on the command line because there are quite a few few dvd menu pages
[22:48:59] <l4yer> hi guys
[22:49:22] <l4yer> looking for a little help wish a ffmpeg bash script if anyone would be so kind
[22:49:27] <l4yer> *with
[22:49:36] <crashrep> prg: try `ffmpeg -loop 1 -i myimage.jpg -pix_fmt yuv420p -t <TIME> output.mp4`
[22:49:38] *** Quits: minimal (~minimal@user/minimal) (Quit: Leaving)
[22:49:43] <crashrep> that's the most well-known way
[22:51:03] <crashrep> Here's another version of the command that I found, that renders much faster, `ffmpeg -i ${2} -filter_complex "[0:v]format=pix_fmts=yuv420p,framerate=fps=1,tpad=stop=-1:stop_mode=clone" -t <TIME> -preset:v ultrafast -y out.mp4`
[22:51:04] <prg> thank you so much crashrep - that's exactly what I needed :)
[22:51:08] <crashrep> See if that will work for you prg
[22:51:34] <crashrep> no problem prg glad I could help.
[22:51:41] <prg> meta-lctrl-L
[22:51:49] <prg> Yup - the second one works too!  thank you :)
[22:51:59] <crashrep> awesome.
[22:52:48] <prg> DVDstyler kinda bombs out if you use an audio file that's longer than your background image, so you can't really use audio files without having a "video" background of the same length.. Kinda silly, but with the power of ffmpeg I can get around it :) thank you so much
[22:53:07] <crashrep> That's great to hear, glad I could be of help :)
[22:55:34] <l4yer> Im looking for a simple way to restart ffmpeg if my stream errors. Would like to know if lines 3-6 will do this https://0bin.net/paste/xuLDJSTj#Cn7gXqWZcNgiKONyxgwvMZNLqHeclHpBqwGrZ80qVtM thanks
