[01:17:37] <iDrougge> I think Lisp’s hey days are gone. Lisp still had a big cult following twenty years ago during the »there is no alternative« era.
[01:17:38] <drakonis> perhaps i'm too curious
[01:17:54] <drakonis> it did, yes.
[01:18:04] <drakonis> but it has finally stabilized

[01:18:38] <iDrougge> Now, there are many alternatives, and a lot of low-hanging fruit has been picked from functional languages.
[01:18:39] <drakonis> hm, do tell
[01:18:40] <riv> yeah it's crazy to think that there was a time where you had to use lisp to get ahold of some lambdas
[01:18:44] <riv> now you get them in everything
[01:18:55] <technomancy> like ... clojure is just not that useful for solving human-level problems; it's useful for solving company-level problems

[01:19:54] <drakonis> you can see it in how people use the languages

[01:46:23] <drakonis> you can't opt into specific DSLs where relevant
[01:46:38] <technomancy> like ... now I just see a bunch of forms I don't recognize and now can't tell where they come from. cool.
[01:46:39] <drakonis> racket is pretty great, yeah.
[01:46:56] <companion_cube> technomancy: so, like lisp?

[01:47:01] <companion_cube> (sorry)
[01:47:12] <wink> technomancy: it's just as if the perfect language doesn't exist :P at least for several sorts of criteria
[01:47:33] <drakonis> now if only racket's core team wasnt trying to do rhombus
[01:47:40] <technomancy> wink: sure but the trade-off of implicitness vs clarity is pretty well-understood

[01:48:12] <drakonis> i hate this
[01:48:14] <drakonis> i hate it so much
[01:48:14] <wink> technomancy: I meant more like the venn diagram of "open to contribute", "actually good", and maybe "big ecosystem"

[01:48:43] <drakonis> otoh lisp give zero fucks about that and has the best repl out there
[01:48:51] <wink> you can call it "primary runtime" maybe more than "language"

[01:48:56] <drakonis> also uh
[01:49:01] <drakonis> racket on top of chez is uhhh
[01:49:06] <drakonis> how do i put it?
[01:49:09] <drakonis> a wild ride?
[01:50:11] <technomancy> I honestly expected the chez stuff to turn into a python3 fiasco
[01:50:18] <technomancy> but it didn't
[01:50:26] <technomancy> and then they went and did rhombus, which still might =)
[01:50:26] <drakonis> well, that's because racket's community isnt gigantic
[01:50:30] * wink is still searching for the perfect language
[01:50:32] <drakonis> oh, but rhombus will
[01:50:38] <c355E3B> wink: prolog!
[01:50:47] <drakonis> its looking like they're ignoring all feedback
[01:50:49] <wink> c355E3B: ok.
[01:50:52] <drakonis> its going to be awful

[01:54:05] <drakonis> running on fumes, rather.
[01:54:14] <technomancy> well on the other hand it's like ...

[01:55:35] *** birb is now known as erica
[01:55:51] <technomancy> the main difference is the racket people literally have a day job that requires them to pay attention to what it's like for newcomers and the clojure ones don't care

[01:58:02] <drakonis> i gravitate towards the non racket schemes because the community is chill
[01:58:05] <drakonis> heckin chill and cool
[01:58:16] <technomancy> but that's about the only thing I'd reach for it for now
[01:58:30] <drakonis> otoh, implementation fragmentation
[01:58:43] <technomancy> it was a lot more appealing to me when I was a Clojure user and didn't have another go-to lisp for when I needed something that didn't run on a server =)
[01:58:49] <drakonis> but the majority of useful rnrs and srfis are available

[01:59:50] <drakonis> mcclim is such as well
[01:59:58] <technomancy> yeah I haven't really needed a gui since 2016 or so when I last touched racket
[02:00:09] <drakonis> what did you need racket for anyways?
[02:00:24] <drakonis> ah, almost forgot, racket seems to be burying itself in layers of indirection

[03:56:49] <pretty_dumm_guy> seems like AMD is bringing Microsoft Pluton to its processors. Man I hate this
[03:57:22] <pretty_dumm_guy> unlike TPM this is gonna be present in the CPU chip.
[03:57:50] <c355E3B> TPMs are already in most CPUs
[03:57:50] <pretty_dumm_guy> ugh
[03:57:58] <c355E3B> Pluton is just making a standard for them
[03:58:18] <pretty_dumm_guy> TPM is present outside the CPU chip right? atleast thats been my understanding so far
[03:58:43] <c355E3B> depends on the setup
[03:58:44] <martian67> it can be, but its also built into cpu
[03:58:52] <martian67> on all modern intel/amd stuff
[03:58:55] <c355E3B> you can get hardware tpms where it connects over something like usb
[03:58:59] <c355E3B> or you can use the on-die one
[03:59:24] <pretty_dumm_guy> I didnt know. This is even more depressing
[04:00:56] <martian67> im guessing they are going to use it to lock windows down hard
[04:01:07] <martian67> hence the TPM 2.0 requirements of windows 11
[04:01:10] <pretty_dumm_guy> has anyone documented/reverse engineered how this Pluton chip works ?
[04:01:15] <martian67> say goodbye to easily virtualizing windows

[04:02:20] <c355E3B> They are never ever getting that option past their enterprise customers
[04:02:32] <c355E3B> there is always going to be a way to turn off 90% of windows that Microsoft will provide
[04:02:42] <c355E3B> Like what happens if your ERD breaks because of windows update?
[04:02:44] <martian67> just like you can turn off kernel codesigning
[04:02:53] <martian67> but then tons of stuff stops working
[04:04:50] <pretty_dumm_guy> c355E3B: Hopefully the flexibility of win 11 is same as that of win 10
[04:05:28] <pretty_dumm_guy> martian67: are you referring to secure boot ? or is it something else ?
[04:06:07] <martian67> no
[04:06:57] <martian67> stuff like netflix, video game anticheat, a bunch of anti-piracy stuff and god knows what else refuses to function if you disable code signing in the kernel
[04:07:15] <martian67> im guessing this shit will be used to force more stuff into windows people hate
[04:07:27] <martian67> and its going to be impossible to disable it
[04:07:34] <pretty_dumm_guy> Oh you mean this ? https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/kernel-mode-code-signing-requirements--windows-vista-and-later-

[04:08:01] <martian67> tthats about signing drivers to load into kernel mode, but yes, its related
[04:08:20] <pretty_dumm_guy> ah okay.
[04:08:31] <pretty_dumm_guy> I am not deeply familiar with the windows internals
[04:08:37] <pretty_dumm_guy> still a novice
[04:11:03] <pretty_dumm_guy> it is interesting though to learn it. To see the differences and similarities with other OSes.

[14:47:17] <riv> git is doing something weird :|
[14:47:32] <riv> im doing a rebase merge and I fixed a conflict, did git add ., git rebase --continue
[14:47:39] <riv> it says "no changes, did you forget to git add"
[14:47:51] <riv> but there were changes
[14:48:07] <riv> git status says you are currently rebasing, all conflicts fixed, run git rebase --continue
[14:48:22] <riv> i must  havegot git into a weird state it doesn't expect somehow?
[14:49:02] <riv> I guess ill just rebase skip
[14:49:33] <riv> vscode has this nice feature where it adds buttons around a merge conflict
[14:49:47] <riv> but it's extremely slow, and you often get race conditions with it
[14:49:50] <riv> so it mangles the source file
[14:53:04] <epilys> did you do git commit --amend after git add?
[14:53:09] <riv> no
[14:53:24] <epilys> ah sorry, you were on a conflict

[18:32:30] <riv> im surprised that IBMs newest quantum computer has not increased this?
[18:32:52] <riv> I imagine it can handle shors algorithm, if anything else can
[18:33:46] <companion_cube> that really shows we're safe from quantum computers a little while longer… :)

[19:02:04] <dutchie> it's not even a latin-1 character afaict
[19:04:46] <dutchie> aha, it is the en dash in windows-1252
[19:05:44] <gwozniak> I am on a support ticket that is nearing 4 months open at this point, and the solution lies in the people working on it understanding their build system, which they apparently don't
[19:06:21] <gwozniak> Because if they set an environment variable to a specific value the problem goes away
[19:06:22] <dutchie> "Most modern web browsers and e-mail clients treat the media type charset ISO-8859-1 as Windows-1252 to accommodate such mislabeling. This is now standard behavior in the HTML5 specification, which requires that documents advertised as ISO-8859-1 actually be parsed with the Windows-1252 encoding" great thanks microsoft
[19:06:58] <gwozniak> But if they set it in their build system it doesn't seem to have an effect
