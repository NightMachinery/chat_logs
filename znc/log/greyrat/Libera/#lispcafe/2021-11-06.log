[00:03:11] <selwyn> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNkw28fz9u0 look at the resolution
[00:03:11] -ixelp- Brainport Vision Device - YouTube
[00:03:23] <selwyn> video came out in 2009, they should have 480p at least
[00:04:36] <shka> selwyn: you see laser light two time, one with the left eye, and one with the right eye
[00:04:44] <shka> ;-)
[00:05:36] <shka> selwyn: given the way it works, i don't think there is any reason for the higher resolution
[00:05:56] <selwyn> hm
[00:06:02] <shka> because you have just so much throughput on the tongue 
[00:06:42] <pl> shka: a scumbag using a green laser pointer on people in cafeteria is why I know the basics of UK self defence laws
[00:06:52] <selwyn> yeah that is really dangerous
[00:06:58] <shka> also, this demonstrates difference between natural neural network and artificial
[00:07:28] <shka> natural neural networks are universal
[00:07:31] <pl> I also happened to once spend ~5h as laser "range safety" person... when I was 14yo or so?
[00:07:50] <pl> so many idiots tried to put the laser to their eye
[00:07:57] <shka> and can adapt to different task using the same overall structure 
[00:08:08] <shka> which, is honestly, astonishing
[00:08:10] * pl had been very fast with power cutoff
[00:08:24] <selwyn> a laser range?
[00:08:31] <shka> and makes me think that there should be some universal learning mechanism that we still have to discover 
[00:08:50] <pl> selwyn: no, I just used the closest fitting word
[00:09:17] <selwyn> but what was it i mean
[00:09:19] <pl> selwyn: my physics teacher borrowed a gas chamber laser for a science fair in middle school
[00:09:39] <pl> I ended up in oversight position for that one exhibit
[00:11:02] <selwyn> and i thought i was bad at laser safety :o
[00:11:12] <pl> Since it was definitely something heavier than Class 1, I took care of it
[00:11:30] <pl> it probably wouldn't damage ... much
[00:11:34] <pl> but better safe than sorry
[00:11:43] <selwyn> i mean, they are all not great for the eyes
[00:12:24] <selwyn> think i am qualified to use class 4
[00:12:31] <pl> Actually, I might have been 15y, it might have been last year of middle school, so I would be working on theory part of pilot course
[00:13:04] <pl> and by that time I've seen and heard my share of aviation *accidents* 
[00:14:57] <selwyn> my school had a cadet program so some of my friends got to fly planes at that age
[00:15:02] <selwyn> but i wisely declined
[00:15:08] <pl> unfun fact - did you know that if you hit soft (normal grass, wet) ground at terminal velocity while close to perfectly level with it, you'll look like you're just sleeping till they turn you over?
[00:15:27] <ln43> ok but there are drones too ... and it's fun make them fly i think

[00:16:45] <ln43> ok, but maybe making a programmable drone to flight without classical controller
[00:17:52] <selwyn> had the fantasy once of building an autonomous drone that would fly around the country and plug itself in to recharge batteries every so often
[00:17:57] <selwyn> but i assume this is difficult
[00:19:04] <ln43> yes for sure the typical flight duration is less than an hour

[02:34:46] <hayley> So, for this dumb assignment, we can use a useful KDF rather than a useless Diffie-Hellman, but have to use a separate MAC process rather than AES GCM.
[02:34:49] * hayley sighs
[02:36:39] <moon-child> mfiano: well, that makes sense; the variable 'pi' is a rational approximation of the circle constant
[02:36:41] <moon-child> but try this on for size
[02:36:46] <moon-child> (real? +inf.0)
[02:36:50] <mfiano> Yes I know why it is what it iws
[02:37:07] <mfiano> Just amusing if a mathematician were to see this
[02:37:45] <mfiano> We tried that a month or so ago :)
[02:42:59] <sham1> Well floats already make a mathematician run away screaming in terror, I think that a rational pi is the least of their worries

[02:44:53] <sham1> I mean, if engineers are anything to go by, an integral pi is all that is needed
[02:45:02] <selwyn> although it is somewhat involved, you can prove that pi is irrational using elementary arguments involving definite integrals
[02:46:20] <moon-child> pi = 10
[02:46:59] <selwyn> pi^2 = g 
[02:47:36] <sham1> The irrationality of pi seems to have a lot of very beefy proofs
[02:47:49] <selwyn> yes
[02:48:23] <selwyn> but as i say you can prove it using relatively elementary arguments (not introducing technical machinery like complex analysis)
[02:50:35] <selwyn> i had to prove pi was irrational in my first week at uni

[05:54:31] * hayley is taking the weekend off now.
[06:12:04] <Alfr> hayley, what's wrong with DH? Negotiate a secret, derive keys for encryption to set up encrypted channels /and/ and authentication tag which each party has to sign and verify to prevent mim.
[06:12:59] <hayley> Surely an attacker could just throw their own keys into key negotiation. You would need an external party (e.g. certificate authority) to determine if the key checks out.
[06:13:34] <hayley> And, given how the mcpi library is used (hint: kids use it to learn Python with Minecraft on Raspberry Pis) getting certificates for each on a local network seems...unreasonable.
[06:15:51] <hayley> (But then why the hell do you care for encryption? I dunno, apparently you do. Apparently practicality doesn't matter for this exercise, but then I could think of a lot more impractical solutions with equal merit apparently.)
[06:16:13] <Alfr> hayley, how're you supposed to check that you're talking to the "correct" endpoint?
[06:16:56] <hayley> Currently I've used scrypt and a shared password to produce a shared key.
[06:17:43] <Alfr> hayley, same problem here, you'd have to tell the other party that psk (and nobody else).
[06:19:11] <hayley> Sure, though explaining a password to a kiddie seems easier than setting up the certificate stuff (but they probably have already seen a password, and I haven't decided in this use case if they use their own device, the school provides one, if it's separate for programming...)
[06:19:58] <hayley> In the more common case of mcpi running on the same machine, literally nothing leaves the machine anyway. This is all nonsense.
[06:31:51] <Alfr> hayley, I don't know mcpis. Only wanted to note that DH is usable to help set up an encrypted channel; as a bonus if you don't retain the secret (and derived keys) it's not feasible to decrypt the recorded exchange later and as secrets are unlikely to be equal that also makes replay attacks useless.
[06:32:45] <hayley> Sure. We just seem to need to exchange something beforehand to verify that we aren't being MITMed, and a password seems the most practical here.
[06:36:06] <Alfr> hayley, sure that should do. But please use H(dh-result|password) or some such, meaning nothing reversible please. :)
[06:50:15] *** |3b|` is now known as |3b|
[06:53:36] <hayley> I just use H(password, random salt provided by server). The salt isn't useful, as we never expose the key, thus no rainbow attacks, but it looks nice in a report.
[06:54:43] <Alfr> hayley, oh, keyed hash function, fancy.

[08:15:49] <clothespin> i don't know why
[08:20:02] <Alfr> gilberth, when handled carelessly accumulated parens may turn into deadly ranged weapons?
[08:22:00] <gilberth> Is it really about parenthesisphobia?
[08:24:23] <Alfr> I think that's what will stand out at a first glance.
[08:25:28] <semz> I like the operator precedence trauma theory
[08:25:32] <semz> even though it's probably bullshit
[08:25:50] <gilberth> And brackets or braces don't stand out? Or those spelled out delimiters in XML?
[08:26:22] <gilberth> I am taking about data, not program text, so there won't be many operators there.
[08:27:03] <Alfr> gilberth, "</bah></blub></blip>" isn't as dense as: )))
[08:27:24] <gilberth> I am just tired, that it feels like I write random parsers for random, broken, ill-specified syntaxes all day.
[08:27:41] <gilberth> Alfr: Indeed.
[08:28:30] <gilberth> It would be fine, if people would actually use XML and not stuffing ad-hoc syntax into attribute values. They don't even eat their own dog food, because it's too verbose.
[08:28:56] <Alfr> gilberth, and when printed (while not properly formated/indented) it may also be harder to read.
[08:31:00] <gilberth> I mean they say <path d="M 100 100 L 200 300"> instead of <path><moveto><x>100</x><y>100</y></moveto><lineto><x>200</x><y>300</y></lineto></path>. Why?
[08:31:39] <gilberth> Nice would be (path (moveto 100 100) (lineto 200 300)), but I guess that's harder to read.
[08:36:00] <Alfr> gilberth, what about: (100 100) M (200 300) L ?
[08:37:27] <Alfr> gilberth, or maybe get rid of parenthesis completely? 100 100 pair M 200 300 pair L
[08:37:44] <hayley> firth-of-forth.mp3
[08:37:52] <gilberth> Hmm, but that has no structure, as you can't tell how many arguments an unknown FOO would take. => Not universal.
[08:41:04] <Alfr> gilberth, borrow DTDs from XML and require arities of "functions" and the number of values they produce to be declared? ;)
[08:42:04] <gilberth> XML once was sold like being a universal syntax, but it just cannot work and people don't use it even. They only misuse it.
[08:42:57] <gilberth> But then it's a silly idea to use a language derived from a markup language to transport data.
[08:48:23] <Alfr> gilberth, if you like pain, you can reach for hdf as a container. But that won't solve the problem when others give you data or the hdf simply packages some nasty to parse format.

[14:07:29] <pl> hayley: what are the permitted ways?
[14:07:58] <hayley> gilberth: What's funny about the LC-3 instruction set we use for learning is that it looks RISC if you are stupid (or a lecturer, same difference), but then it has some funky instructions that store and load through two layers of indirection (i.e. [[PC + n]])
[14:10:04] <hayley> pl: IIRC you are supposed to use a "block cipher" with either MAC-then-encrypt, encrypt-then-MAC, MAC-and-encrypt, and a fourth one that no one has heard of, yet apparently there's four.
[14:10:26] <hayley> But not an authenticated cipher mode, and not really a stream cipher, though apparently CTR is fine.
[14:10:34] <gilberth> hayley: Oops, That's not the classical load/store approach.
[14:10:48] <pl> well, it's not like you can't whack a block cipher into stream one ... :P
[14:11:09] <hayley> Yes, there aren't even many CISCs these days which do double indirections.
[14:11:17] <hayley> "though apparently CTR is fine"
[14:13:43] <hayley> pl: Also, we have to get a shared key somehow, the only useful team mate thinks that a shared password and scrypt is no good, and using any asymmetric key exchange like Diffie-Hellman achieves nothing, because then you have to check that the public key of the server really belongs to the server and not an attacker.
[14:14:13] <pl> Well, yes, but there's AFAIK no other way
[14:14:40] <pl> I mean, D-H doesn't care about public keys, but doesn't provide authentication of peer
[14:15:11] <hayley> The whole cybersecurity course would be hilarious if you're not paying to attend, and if you aren't getting graded for it. Stuff like the lecturer not knowing how to make the openssl command decrypt, the lecturers not testing any code that they clearly plagarized, and then using RSA/ECB and DES for demos somehow...
[14:15:30] <pl> the openssl is understandable
[14:15:35] <pl> I end up in manpage everytime
[14:15:44] <pl> and I use it for several years now
[14:15:49] <hayley> Right, we want message integrity and so it's game over if someone MITMs the D-H key exchange.
[14:16:05] <hayley> Sure. Though you'd hope they wrote it down somewhere if they're going to teach it...
[14:16:25] <pl> so you need to design a scheme for authentication
[14:16:31] <pl> what is your threat model?
[14:17:32] <pl> remember that D-H style key exchange and public key crypto were originally left to gather dust not because they were weak, but because NSA had already deployed a shared key distribution system
[14:17:51] <hayley> All we're supposed to do is provide message integrity and confidentiality. I assume that an attacker only can diddle packets over the network.
[14:18:16] <pl> then I guess a pre-shared key would be fine
[14:18:25] <pl> unless you can get extra credit for something fancier
[14:18:38] <hayley> Yeah, except we're not supposed to use a pre-shared key. Hence why I wanted a password + KDF scheme.
[14:18:47] <pl> hayley: consider PAKE?
[14:18:55] <pl> password + KDF is a PSK
[14:19:03] <hayley> But then my partner said "well, that's just a fancy way of doing a pre-shared key" and went for D-H to cover his ass.
[14:19:58] <pl> https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2018/10/19/lets-talk-about-pake/
[14:20:05] <hayley> Oh, but password + KDF is fine too.
[14:20:33] <selwyn> i wonder if quantum key distribution will be viable at the small business/household level
[14:20:38] * hayley reads
[14:20:58] <pl> selwyn: doubtful, the infrastructure doesn't seem to have scaling factors available to make it cheaper
[14:21:10] <selwyn> yeah pretty much my first thoughts
[14:21:48] <hayley> "The great thing about PAKE is that the simpler “login only” use-case is easy to achieve. If I have a standard PAKE protocol that allows a client and server to agree on a shared key K if (and only if) the client knows the right password, then all we need add is a simple check that both parties have arrived at the same key."
[14:21:50] <pl> I mean, theoretically I think there was some interesting possibility but it's a bit akin to "heeeeey, what if we wired houses with IB"
[14:21:58] <selwyn> ib?
[14:22:01] <pl> infiniband
[14:22:18] <selwyn> ok
[14:22:29] <pl> US DoD supposedly has continental-USA spanning IB network
[14:22:42] <pl> most places have only only isolated subnets
[14:22:54] <hayley> The protocol I designed first basically had this: S would send a salt and challenge plaintext to C, C would generate the key and then responded with the ciphertext.
[14:23:11] <pl> but tl;dr I think someone at cisco designed a scheme where quantum effects were used to route optical signals end-to-end
[14:23:37] <selwyn> issue with qkd is that you will simply lose single photons, and standard telecoms equipment does not help remedy those losses to put it mildly
[14:23:39] <pl> hayley: so, a CHAP variation?
[14:23:45] <selwyn> because of all the switching
[14:23:48] <hayley> I wouldn't know, sorry.
[14:24:13] <hayley> But given that the lecturers give demo code using (single, even) DES, it'd go well over their heads.
[14:24:16] <pl> hayley: well, CHAP is essentially "Challenge-Response"
[14:24:38] <hayley> Shit's bad when the demo includes code with the string "Welcome to tutorialspoint.com"
[14:24:59] <pl> I think Plan9 has remains of possibly des-based NSA-derived challenge-response login system
[14:25:19] <pl> which used physical tokens
[14:25:23] <hayley> Ah yeah, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge-Handshake_Authentication_Protocol looks similar.
[14:26:07] <pl> honestly, I'd just do PKI if possible, or some form of offline kerberos shared keys if not
[14:26:12] <selwyn> so assuming that you can invent good enough switches and infrastructure, then yeah you have to replace most of the internet infrastructure or build it on top of the existing one
[14:26:38] <selwyn> qkd experiments are already very impressive but done on dedicated links
[14:26:48] <hayley> pl: The other thing is, it's a three week assignment, and I now have 26 hours if I wanted to do (another) redesign.
[14:27:37] <hayley> This includes a demonstration video, a design document and an investigation into the "security-performance tradeoff" (with AES-NI, I calculated there would be no performance dip - in practise there is somehow...)
[14:28:05] <pl> hayley: hooking PKI should be reasonably easy to do fast while getting considerable level of safety... but yes, it would hit on the presentation

[14:28:41] <hayley> PKI = Public Key Infrastructure?
[14:28:45] <pl> yes
[14:29:39] <hayley> Another problem is that, in context, this is a hack for a protocol which was originally designed to make the Raspberry Pi version of Minecraft scriptable from Python.

[14:30:32] <hayley> Thus, any real infrastructure just looks stupid. A certificate authority would be a stretch, since I don't expect any school to use static IPs for devices, nor set up domain names for them all.
[14:30:36] <pl> can you wrap the whole thing?
[14:30:58] <pl> hayley: doesn't really need to have domain names et al

[20:10:39] <gilberth> It is also worth noticing, that there is not a single correct implementation of lex(1) with regard to trailing context as in a/b, which means "match a, when followed by b". This is because once you can do that with a DFA, you can do general submatch addressing with a DFA. You even find papers about this and that kludge to make it almost working. So much for that.

[20:18:20] <gilberth> ln43: And? Have you even read them? Do they say how to do submatch addressing with DFAs?

[20:25:43] <ln43> or things like that

[21:55:16] <ln43> if i had the possibility i would like to live in a hotel forever...
[21:55:41] <ln43> restaurant, bar, everything at disposal
[21:56:10] <gilberth> ln43: Incompatible with my sleeping pattern.
[21:56:19] * gilberth hates hotels.
[21:56:30] <ln43> why?
[21:56:39] <gilberth> See above.
[21:57:55] <gilberth> Besides you can't smoke there.
[21:58:30] <ln43> yes, outside the room 
[21:58:51] <gilberth> Exactly. That's the problem.
[21:59:19] <ln43> for example after i cleaned my car i'm not more confortable in smoking inside...
[22:00:14] <gilberth> It's cold outside, it could rain, there could be a storm; what are houses made for, again?
[22:01:12] <ln43> yes true but then it's a problem when not smokers came to visit 
[22:01:39] <gilberth> Which is only a problem, if the space I live in, is not mine.
[22:02:13] <ln43> you know, in smoking room it's required an higher air recirculation 
[22:02:36] <ln43> and that is not always possible, expecially when the temperature outside is cold
[22:02:41] <ln43> during the winter
[22:02:45] <contrapunctus> gilberth: cleaning lady, * who would come by ...
[22:02:59] <ln43> without affecting the energetic balance 
[22:03:15] <gilberth> ln43: It's outright forbidden by law in most places.
[22:03:49] <gilberth> contrapunctus: Of course! She is no object, I guess. ;)
[22:04:54] <gilberth> contrapunctus: But thanks! I ought to be more careful.
[22:05:49] <ln43> to be honest i appreciated too lately the benifits of a clean environment
[22:06:02] <ln43> but they are indiscutable 
[22:06:18] <ln43> of course, cleaning require patience and a bit of discipline
[22:06:26] <ln43> it's instructive at the end
[22:07:41] <gilberth> Well, if my room is too tidy, it depresses me and I can't be creative.
[22:07:43] <contrapunctus> gilberth: knowing that it probably arises from a German background, it reminded me of "The Awful German Language" https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/A_Tramp_Abroad/Appendix_D 😄
[22:07:43] -ixelp- A Tramp Abroad/Appendix D - Wikisource, the free online library
[22:08:50] <contrapunctus> (Very funny read for anyone who knows even a little German. Written by the inimitable Mark Twain.)
[22:09:58] <gilberth> contrapunctus: Yes, as in German, we make no distinction with relative clauses if we refer to objects or persons. English and German also are too close, so you get careless at times.
[22:10:00] * gilberth reads.
[22:10:13] <ln43> gilberth, i think that order is possibly a good thing, maybe it's just a matter of colors or furnishings ...
[22:10:43] <ln43> yes maybe there should be work for an architect ...
[22:11:29] <gilberth> ln43: Give me an empty desk, and I get a crisis. I would feel like in some hospital or some furniture store.
[22:11:40] * gilberth continues reading.
[22:11:48] <ln43> ok, but there are desks and desks
[22:21:59] <gilberth> contrapunctus: This is a fun text to read! Lightens my mood. And so very true. And the example with "wegen des Regens" is fun moreso, since recently you hear "wegen" with the wrong case often. The genitive is dying a slow death and perhaps painful death.
[22:22:17] <selwyn> do you think german is a difficult language gilberth
[22:23:24] <gilberth> selwyn: Let's put it this way: I am lucky, that I don't have to learn it. But then I still struggle with English, it looks easy, but IMHO isn't.
[22:25:34] <gilberth> But then my formal English education was so bad, that you could call it hardly a joke even.
[22:28:02] <gilberth> selwyn: The text contrapunctus posted is true. There are more exceptions to rules then instances. But cases is none of them, I guess they only appear difficult because English uses the same "the" no matter what case.
[22:30:09] <contrapunctus> https://jabjab.de:5443/upload/a75f5b15713067434614f6d0c986f536c301cf7e/03TIICeTd0gqxXNx1nuPcWZv3CUSVixcYRlLHdtw/h9qaEJn6S7aayJzir4WKuQ.png
[22:30:11] <contrapunctus> gilberth: ^ relevant 😏
[22:32:50] <ln43> from my personal perspective difficult languages can be classified things like arabic an chinese ...
[22:33:33] <ln43> and
[22:34:00] <ck_> arabic and chinese are classified? oh no
[22:34:05] <ln43> xd
[22:34:33] <contrapunctus> lol
[22:35:02] <contrapunctus> Yeah, if you know English, at least learning German doesn't involve learning a whole new script.
[22:36:05] <ln43> ok but knowing english as a derived language from something else maybe is more effective
[22:42:09] <ln43> for example i have some books written in languages i don't know and that is a thing i use for decoration mostly... since the covers are nice and i asked them as a gift
[22:42:26] <ln43> just to remember trips and so on... 
[22:42:48] <selwyn> periodic reminder that aspiring language learners should check out anki
[22:42:58] <selwyn> it is a game changer if not a life changer
[22:44:12] <ln43> one of the most recent is a book of poems
[22:45:37] <ln43> anki?
[22:45:58] <shka> hi all
[22:46:13] <selwyn> o/
[22:46:21] <ln43> hi
[22:46:29] <selwyn> ln43: anki is a flashcard app that can help you learn vocabulary
[22:46:37] <shka> i never realized that my microphone gather clicks from the keyboard so much 
[22:46:41] <selwyn> or anything else
[22:47:13] <selwyn> shka: it's your excellent taste in keyboards and keypads coming through
[22:47:15] <selwyn> crisp sounds
[22:47:40] <shka> yeah, i likey clicky keyboards
[22:47:52] <shka> and those clickbar switches are the stuff
[22:48:12] <selwyn> how do you input λ?
[22:48:25] <shka> i don't
[22:48:27] <selwyn> considering using lambda-reader
[22:48:41] <shka> it is emacs prettify mode
[22:48:44] <selwyn> oh
[22:49:00] <shka> you can replace the strings with a symbols
[22:49:10] <selwyn> i like the sound of that
[22:49:10] <shka> lambda was an obvious candidates for that 
[22:49:25] <shka> but it is purely eye candy stuff
[22:49:27] <shka> nothing more
[22:50:17] <shka> prettify-symbols-mode
[22:50:33] <shka> just add   (add-hook 'slime-mode-hook 'prettify-symbols-mode)
[22:51:06] <shka> and also configure prettify symbols-alist 
[22:51:11] <shka> which is simple 
[22:51:15] <shka> (setq prettify-symbols-alist '(("lambda" . ?λ) ("alpha" . ?α) ("sigma" . ?σ) ("tau" . ?τ) ("gamma" . ?γ) ("beta" . ?β))) for me
[22:51:47] <shka> lambda may be a default here, btw
[22:54:03] <gilberth> Learning a new script would be the easiest part of learning a new language.
[22:54:29] <selwyn> gilberth: depends heavily on the script
[22:54:50] <gilberth> contrapunctus: Yes, "Der Genitiv ist dem Dativ sein Tod."
[22:55:03] <contrapunctus> Heh, yeah...
[22:57:13] <gilberth> selwyn: As long as it is not ideographic, what could be so hard about learning a few letters? You need to learn pronunciation even if the script is familiar anyway. And with English you can't tell from how a word is written, how it should be pronounced.
[22:57:58] <selwyn> because some scripts (more than one might think) are simply not compatible with ease of reading or writing of the target language in mind
[22:58:10] <gilberth> contrapunction: I mixed that up. *blush* "Der Dativ ist dem Genitiv sein Tod." That way!
[22:58:47] <selwyn> i planned to learn the arabic alphabet in order to read ottoman calligraphy
[22:59:03] <selwyn> but that would be considerably harder than actually learning to speak the language
[22:59:07] <gilberth> Which is funny, because correct would be to use genitive. Like "Der Dativ ist des Genitives Tod."
[22:59:10] <selwyn> tibetan also quite difficult afaik
[22:59:50] <gilberth> selwyn: Perhaps, but compared to a whole new language, I still would consider that a small part.
[23:00:04] <selwyn> i don't agree lol
[23:00:06] <selwyn> but ok
[23:00:29] <gilberth> You're not obligated to agree. ;)
[23:01:09] <gilberth> Perhaps I have limited experience in foreign scripts.
[23:01:27] <selwyn> in the ottoman empire, well-educated middle class teenagers of around 15yo were often still functionally illiterate in the language owing to how difficult the alphabet was
[23:02:05] <selwyn> hm, prettify mode takes the colour away from the slime repl
[23:02:07] <selwyn> which i don't like
[23:02:44] <gilberth> selwyn: ok. And it was the Arabic alphabet you say?
[23:02:47] <shka> selwyn: also, remember that the ottoman empire used 3 languages
[23:03:10] <selwyn> gilberth: yes
[23:03:42] <selwyn> to cut a long story short, arabic is big on consonants but short on vowels
[23:03:48] <selwyn> while turkish is the opposite
[23:04:05] <selwyn> so it is not really suited in the first place
[23:04:26] <selwyn> the latin alphabet does not suffer from that problem and is culturally neutral
[23:04:47] <selwyn> shka: maybe 5+ depending on how you count it
[23:04:55] <gilberth> Aren't vowels just little decorations in the Arabic script? Or do I missrember that?
[23:05:02] <selwyn> short vowels can be annotated
[23:05:10] <selwyn> but equally, they can be omitted, which they are most of the time
[23:05:29] <shka> selwyn: persian, arabic, turkish
[23:06:01] <gilberth> Ok. That won't of course work for a language which is rich in vowels.
[23:06:23] <selwyn> french as scientific language, armenian as lingua france of administrative classes
[23:06:58] <selwyn> strictly speaking persian was not spoken widely in the empire, only that persian was essentially merged into ottoman turkish
[23:07:16] <shka> selwyn: well, it was the language of the elite 
[23:07:33] <shka> the court was speaking persian
[23:07:44] <selwyn> yes
[23:08:14] <selwyn> anyway, it is a completely lost language now
[23:08:30] <selwyn> in a very real sense, more dead than latin will ever be
[23:08:59] <selwyn> despite the fact that people could speak it at least until 1950
[23:10:01] <selwyn> i believe that lipka tatars wrote polish in the latin alphabet
[23:10:08] <selwyn> *arabic
[23:10:42] <gilberth> Makes sense. :)
[23:17:33] <selwyn> am considering learning persian next actually
[23:17:50] <selwyn> but it would be in the latter half of next year if at all
[23:21:21] <ln43> now i'm facing visual artifacts in rendering a texture and i can't classify the kind of issue: is there somewhere a classification to be used to identify the problems?

[23:24:11] <ln43> 30 fps should be enough or not?
[23:26:29] <gilberth> It that the refresh rate of your display?
[23:26:45] <ln43> i'm not sure
[23:26:54] <selwyn> isn't 30fps rubbish
[23:27:14] <ln43> ok but the same is hapening if i increase to 60 fps
