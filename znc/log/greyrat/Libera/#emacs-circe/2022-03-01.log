[03:46:19] <talismanick> Right now, I have :sasl-password (lambda (server) (password-store-get "irc/libera.chat/talismanick")) for "Libera" in circe-network-options
[03:46:39] <talismanick> How can I get it to wait on connecting until I unlock my password store correctly?
[03:47:11] <talismanick> (right now, if I type in my password store key incorrectly, it goes ahead on connecting and fails on loop until I'm locked out for several hours at a time)

[21:43:56] <howard-abrams> Good question, I wrote a little function for me to run when it has finished connecting, but it would be nice to have to automated. Perhaps there is a hook?
[22:34:36] <wasamasa> I don't think there is actually
[22:35:30] <wasamasa> you can use `circe-server-connected-hook', but it may not be run when you expect it to be
[22:35:54] <wasamasa> like, before all specified channels have been joined
