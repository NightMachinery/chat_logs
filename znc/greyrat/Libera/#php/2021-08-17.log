[03:29:28] <Sammitch> the caveat with the US is that it's still federally illegal, but some states have varying levels of decriminalization/legalization, so if you DO visit and you go somewhere it's OK do not travel across state or national borders with it.

[22:55:20] <DevAntoine> thanks
[22:55:38] <Sammitch> what did I mess up in my example that self:: doesn't even work? https://3v4l.org/HqKRT

[23:47:39] <relipse> so instead of static::FOO should you do self::FOO ?
[23:48:30] <__adrian> no; you shouldn't try to use private consts from a child class
[23:48:40] <__adrian> if the child class needs to use it make it protected instead
[23:49:04] <__adrian> or make the getter (in the parent class) use self

[23:54:26] <relipse> that is not in a child class?
[23:54:43] <relipse> oh i see

[23:54:54] <relipse> its a warning of bad coding because it is exposing it to the child
[23:55:28] <__adrian> y
[23:55:58] <relipse> i think its saying that when you use static:: it will try to use the child class's constant FOO which might not exist
[23:56:05] <__adrian> right
