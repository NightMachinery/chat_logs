[00:14:33] <stenno> lol
[00:15:17] <Stanley> if($isDirectory != null) { if($isDirectory){ // ... } }
[00:15:32] <Stanley> PHP stan claims that the second $isDirectory is always "True" because of the previous check
[00:15:37] <Stanley> so does PHPStorm
[00:15:54] <Stanley> `Condition is always 'true' because '$isDirectory != NULL' is already 'true' at this point`
[00:16:22] <Stanley> but .... if $isDirectory = false, it would pass the != null check but fail the if($isDirectory) check, no?
[00:16:39] <novns> Stanley, you need is_null()
[00:16:55] <da_wunder> or === null
[00:17:03] <novns> or this way
[00:17:35] <novns> !== in this case
[00:17:41] <da_wunder> like - https://phpstan.org/r/b2c2064c-f7e1-4ddc-b95c-170f9ca4701a
[00:18:04] <NoiseEee> i might add that it is odd for a property/variable to be called 'is<Something>' and have a value other than true or false
[00:18:05] <da_wunder> no need for that second if statement at all
[00:18:17] <Albright_> Looks like `false != null` is false https://3v4l.org/cVlkm
[00:18:41] <Albright_> NoiseEee: Ah, good eye.
[00:18:53] <da_wunder> NoiseEee: so please explain what you have there
[00:19:39] <Stanley> not my code it's in a library i'm using, double negatives are confusing especially when null isn't a negative, lol
[00:20:25] <da_wunder> Stanley: so raise an issue to that repository about that and see what happens
[00:21:17] <da_wunder> Stanley: there might be good reason why that behaviour is there - or not - we don't know which library you're talking about, so cannot check that
[00:23:14] <Stanley> yeah
[00:23:25] <Stanley> i think it's just a bad check

[01:46:49] <Albright_> So I'm using a framework which doesn't have proper database update framework (an older version of CI)
[01:47:48] <Albright_> So I built a ghetto one where the update scripts start with a number like 0024-friends.php and I keep track of which number of script I last ran and my "update" script just checks for all scripts which are numbered higher than the last ran script.
[01:48:30] <Albright_> Where this falls apart is when I have parallel branches, so I might have a script #26 in one branch and a different #26 in another.
[01:49:01] <novns> Albright_, and now it's time to rewrite everything from scratch
[01:49:09] <Albright_> When I merge, I have to rename the scripts in the other branch (and the classes they contain) to unique numbers.
[01:49:22] <Albright_> Is there a better way to do this which won't take too much effort?
[01:49:51] <Byteflux> Use timestamps instead of sequences, maybe.
[01:50:49] <novns> Albright_, or add minor versions like 0024.002-friends.php
[01:51:02] <Albright_> Ah, that might work
[01:51:28] <Albright_> I think with timestamps it'd be difficult to specify which scripts need to run in what order.
[01:52:01] <Albright_> What comes to mind is to not number the scripts, instead keep track of  have a separate "updates.php" file which have a row of all update scripts in the order in an array and just keep track of which script has last run. If that's not the last one in the array, run the scripts after it in the array in order.
[01:52:07] <Albright_> After merging I'd just have to update that one array.
[01:52:54] <Albright_> Ooh, yeah, I think that's a good idea. In some ways more ghetto than what I've already got but it'd solve the problem I think.

[02:15:57] <Sammitch> Albright_: 1. Use timestamps in the file name. 2. test the migrations in CI. 3. with multi-branch workflow the first to merge wins. breaking changes should be caught by the CI job and the merge updated accordingly.

[02:20:09] <Sammitch> every time someone files a PR here Jenkins [or travis or gitlab or wtf ever you want] fires up a job to run all the tests on a merge of the branch and passing those tests is required before the branch can be merged.
[02:20:44] <Albright_> lol when I first got brought in on this codebase I tried to talk the client in to adding tests to that… somehow I couldn't sell "let's spend a couple dozen hours to add zero new features" to her.
[02:21:12] <Albright_> Believe me, I would *love* to work on a code base which had that sort of stuff again.
[02:21:59] <Sammitch> so add what tests you can as you go. something like testing the DB migrations, or checking regressions is going to save you time in the long run
[02:23:36] <Byteflux> some tests are better than no tests. 100% coverage is foolish and unattainable, but getting to 30-50% coverage from 0% can be very helpful and is pretty easy to slowly get there.
[02:23:37] <Albright_> In the end, though, that'd help detect the issue, but it's not really a framework to avoid it, right? I already know I have the issue because when I try to run my "run all new updates" script I'll get an unexpected result.
[02:24:55] <Albright_> Believe me, you don't have to convince me on the testing stuff. You need to convince my client. Unfortunately she's not always so great about thinking long-term.

[02:33:36] <Sammitch> in the last 3 years since I've left their staff has shrunk 75% and none of their major clients use them anymore
[02:34:54] <Sammitch> my main beef was a lack of centralization and automation that meant they they had to scale staff roughly linearly with the number of clients, which was absolutely and hilariously unsustainable
[02:36:52] <Albright_> Ha, yeah. At my first agency I eventually got our Drupal set up such that it was a multisite instance with all the smaller/less weird client sites being subsites of our main web site. Spinning up a new client site and keeping all clients' sites updated became super easy.
[02:38:00] <Albright_> But the boss there was pretty flexible with letting me work on "experiments" in down time between client work. I'd like to think it paid off for him.

[05:44:15] <alturic> Hello. When using PDO and transactions in a loop - I know it's a silly question - but PHP is synchronous right? If I have a foreach, and inside each loop I start a transaction and commit/rollback the transaction it doesn't proceed to the next iteration until the transaction/queries are done, correct?
[05:44:56] <alturic> I literally have one script that foreach's over an array, starts a transaction on each iteration, and commits/rolls back the transaction on each iteration... yet I'm getting deadlocks for some reason.
[05:45:16] <rveerman> yeah, PHP is synchronous
[05:45:37] <rveerman> show me the source, maybe i can help
[05:45:50] <alturic> And PHP waits for the query to complete before executing code after the queries, right?
[05:45:57] <alturic> i.e. it waits for the mysql response.
[05:46:15] <rveerman> that depends on your libary by which you access mysql
[05:46:18] <Blondie101010> alturic:  the lock would be explained from the DB, not from an individual, possibly irrelevant PHP script
[05:47:55] <alturic> rveerman By library, do you mean raw PDO?
[05:48:33] <Blondie101010> it depends on the actual queries running on your RDBMS
[05:48:33] <rveerman> i don't know what PDO is, i always use https://adodb.sourceforge.net for accessing SQL databases
[05:48:40] <rveerman> and that's synchronous allright
[05:48:40] <Blondie101010> ask your dba for assistance
[05:49:10] <Blondie101010> or DB support resources
[05:49:22] <alturic> I am the DBA. I see the deadlock from innodb. I'm just trying to understand why it's locking, especially if this is synchronously running the queries.
[05:49:37] <Blondie101010> then hire a better DBa
[05:49:38] <alturic> I've used PDO and transactions for ages, and never one had these deadlock issues.
[05:49:48] <Blondie101010> at least someone who knows where to get help for their DB

[05:52:39] <alturic> Yea, I wasn't sure if this was a PHP-related issue or not. I kinda knew the answer to PHP waiting for queries/mysql returning before proceeding into code, but wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something on how it wouldn't... "wait".
[05:52:41] <Blondie101010> false
[05:52:46] <rveerman> alturic which php library do you use to access your mysql? which function names?
[05:52:48] <Blondie101010> it can't be a PHP issue
[05:53:06] <alturic> rveerman Raw PDO.
[05:53:19] <Blondie101010> the SQL could be (partially) responsible
[05:53:22] <rveerman> one sec, i'll look up the manual for raw PDO then
[05:53:28] <Blondie101010> nothing PHP related
[05:53:33] <rveerman> blondie nonsense
[05:54:05] <Blondie101010> so you think that PHP causes mysql to have deadlocks in the queries it runs?
[05:54:14] <Blondie101010> do you know how to use a computer?
[05:54:29] <rveerman> Database queries are executed synchronously. But don't take my word for it, check the manual:
[05:54:31] <rveerman> PDO: http://php.net/manual/en/pdostatement.execute.phpyYY
[05:54:33] <rveerman> y
[05:54:42] <Blondie101010> yes they are

[05:54:50] <Blondie101010> that does not affect my answer
[05:55:15] <Blondie101010> the same queries run outside of PHP would have the exact same effect
[05:55:17] <rveerman> alturic describe the deadlock in a bit more detail, plz
[05:55:30] <alturic> I mean, I really don't think it's PHP-related at a core level. PHP is just issuing a DELETE. Then foreaching over an array. On each iteration it starts a transaction, INSERTs into tableA. Get's the inserted ID. Iterates over a second array, INSERTing into tableB. Commits or rollback.
[05:56:00] <rveerman> ok
[05:56:09] <rveerman> how does the script freeze?
[05:56:09] <Blondie101010> alturic: please show the whole transaction SQL for one example case (no variables)
[05:56:29] <Blondie101010> you'll need that to ask a useful question to other channels as well
[05:57:04] <rveerman> yeah, post your business logic code that gets into the deadlock situation onto pastebin.com or some similar site please
[05:57:10] <Blondie101010> deadlocks often indicate a bad sequence of queries
[05:57:18] <rveerman> and give us the URL to that then
[06:00:22] <alturic> https://hastebin.com/utexikubay.php
[06:00:51] <alturic> tableB has a FK back to tableA
[06:01:56] <Blondie101010> why is this incomplete code?
[06:02:03] <Blondie101010> and not what I asked for at all
[06:02:07] <Blondie101010> I asked for SQL
[06:02:07] <alturic> Oh, you wanted the column names and variable names?
[06:02:18] <Blondie101010> the sql that php runs
[06:02:28] <Blondie101010> with substituted variables
[06:02:30] <rveerman> looks like you're doing the SQL right
[06:02:38] <rveerman> i dont need to see the variables for tht
[06:02:40] <rveerman> that
[06:02:46] <Blondie101010> this code is stripped down
[06:02:49] <alturic> Blondie101010 you're a nice person and all, but you can clearly see the queries that would be ran?
[06:02:51] <rveerman> how does the script freeze?
[06:03:14] <Blondie101010> alturic:  yes, but finding this type of problem is not obvious
[06:03:41] <rveerman> INSERT statements should be handled sequentially and synchronously, blondie..
[06:03:42] <Blondie101010> and based on what is mere comments could indicate problems with how you build them
[06:03:52] <Blondie101010> how can you have real problems with incomplete code?
[06:03:59] <Blondie101010> show the real code or the queries that it runs
[06:04:15] <rveerman> alturic how does the script freeze??
[06:06:08] <Blondie101010> but otherwise the code sample we have does look proper
[06:06:49] <alturic> According to (and this is where #mysql would presumably come in),    show engine innodb status      show's the deadlock is issuing the delete query and it *looks* like it's waiting for the lock on the tableB insert. I can certainly put the deadlock code on a paste as well but... unsure how fluent you are in MySQL. :P
[06:07:27] <Blondie101010> are you running other queries in parallel on these same tables?
[06:07:54] <alturic> If that snippet of code is synchronously ran, no other script deletes or inserts to any of these two tables.
[06:08:23] <alturic> There are/can be "normal" SELECT queries being ran however, but no types of SELECT queries that (from what I understand of SQL) would cause locks.
[06:08:28] <Blondie101010> ok move to #mysql please and provide them your damn queries
[06:08:35] <rveerman> i'll google it a bit, alturic.. gimme a couple of minutes
[06:10:25] <rveerman> alturic check out https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41581092/how-to-lock-an-sql-row-with-pdo please
[06:10:32] <rveerman> note the comment pointing to the mysql manual
[06:10:35] <rveerman> read that too
[06:11:34] <rveerman> blondie101010 you really need to tone down your pass-the-buck attitude.... :p
[06:11:43] <Blondie101010> he's not doing that
[06:11:56] <rveerman> not doing what?
[06:12:11] <Blondie101010> trying to do any locks intentionally
[06:12:29] <rveerman> no but he is asking about how mysql handles locking
[06:12:37] <Blondie101010> absolutely
[06:12:43] <rveerman> and it's described in that stackoverflow thread i just posted
[06:12:46] <Blondie101010> not a PHP question
[06:12:50] <Blondie101010> no
[06:12:55] <rveerman> in my opinion it is..
[06:12:55] <Blondie101010> your link is for something else
[06:12:59] <rveerman> but lets agree to disagree ok
[06:13:06] <Blondie101010> that's just false
[06:13:12] <Blondie101010> it's not my opinion
[06:13:16] <Blondie101010> not the same situation
[06:13:43] <Blondie101010> and NOT a PHP question!
[06:14:01] <rveerman> EDIT
[06:14:03] <rveerman> I put both in one file with two pdo instances and this time the lock worked. I don't really understand how a server manages queries when having many requests. Are there going to be many processes or many threads? Will it stay locked for all cases or only in the case of many threads? Thanks.
[06:14:07] <rveerman> from that stackoverflow thread
[06:14:37] <rveerman> For proper row locking you should look at:
[06:14:39] <rveerman> https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-locking.html
[06:14:41] <rveerman> However this requires your database table is innodb not myisam.
[06:15:03] *** Quits: WishBoy (~WishBoy@user/wishboy) (Remote host closed the connection)
[06:15:23] <Blondie101010> rveerman: where in alturic's code do you see the word 'lock'?
[06:15:28] <rveerman> from https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-locking.html :
[06:15:33] <rveerman> Insert Intention Locks
[06:15:39] <Blondie101010> now start paying attention
[06:15:43] <Blondie101010> not his case!
[06:15:50] <alturic> rveerman, I only use InnoDB.
[06:16:26] <Blondie101010> that link applies to explicit locks
[06:16:34] <rveerman> well ok, then that section of the mysql manual that i just posted is what you should read now, alturic.. and you may need to read more from that manual too
[06:16:46] <Blondie101010> anyways
[06:16:54] <Blondie101010> the problem is related to CRUD
[06:17:18] <alturic> I'm also not intentionally trying to lock anything. I never have. I'm trying to understand (say high amount of hits to the tables) if any "normal" SELECT queries lock tables or rows. Because otherwise, I have numerous scripts that run code and transactions like this, although not on high traffic tables, and have never once had a deadlock in the
[06:17:18] <alturic> years I've been coding.
[06:17:44] <Blondie101010> alturic:  those can be hard to clarify sometimes
[06:18:00] <Blondie101010> you need to look at the queries and data passed
[06:18:18] <Blondie101010> follow it step by step to understand why it gets a deadlock
[06:18:50] <Blondie101010> changing the order of queries inside a transaction can sometimes "magically" solve them
[06:19:48] <Blondie101010> if there are constraints in your DB, those could play a role
[06:20:34] <rveerman> alturic your locks are mysql default behavior.. you need to query your db between each INSERT step for the output to the sql command 'SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS'..
[06:20:58] <Blondie101010> ugh what
[06:21:03] <rveerman> and run that on a 2nd php $pdo instance, ok
[06:21:07] <alturic> https://hastebin.com/nevuditoba.yaml If either of you cared to look at the deadlock itself. But yes Blondie I agree now, this is getting into the #mysql realm. The [tableA], [tableB], [theFKName] are obviously trying to make it easy to "see".
[06:21:09] <rveerman> RTFM, blondie!
[06:21:36] <rveerman> yeah, it is #mysql territory now, alturic
[06:21:41] <alturic> :P
[06:21:42] <Blondie101010> rveerman:  read the scroll back attentively
[06:22:02] <rveerman> no, blondie. i don't like ur attitude at all
[06:22:13] <Blondie101010> not what I said or suggested
[06:22:31] <Blondie101010> it would not be nice to accept the crap you say
[06:22:36] <rveerman> we narrowed down a problem from PHP territory into mysql manual territory.
[06:22:42] <rveerman> doing that thoroughly is a win, not a loss
[06:24:10] <alturic> TBF to Blondie, they knew and I pretty much knew, PHP executes the code synchronously. Anything related to the DB locking, deadlocking or not actually inserting the data as the query sent it would be MySQL-related.
[06:24:18] <alturic> As much as I do think they are a little brash. Ha
[06:29:16] <molt> hey all. having a really hard time upgrading from php 7.2 to php 7.4 on CentOS 7.9
[06:29:32] <molt> followed a million tutorials, but no joy.
[06:29:36] <molt> could anyone help?
[06:29:38] <rveerman> ok, what's the error msg or error description, molt?
[06:29:57] <rveerman> i just upgraded from 7.4 to 8.0.11
[06:30:04] <molt> Processing Conflict: php72w-common-7.2.34-1.w7.x86_64 conflicts php-common < 7.2
[06:30:14] <rveerman> had to recompile a php extension to make it work again
[06:31:04] <rveerman> molt did you use a OS package delivery method to upgrade to PHP7.4?
[06:31:18] <molt> the machine i'm doing this on is a VM in Hyper-V so I can easily go back to an earlier snapshot when the upgrade fails
[06:31:54] <molt> I followed these instructions: https://computingforgeeks.com/how-to-install-php-7-4-on-centos-7/
[06:32:09] <rveerman> molt how does that error description you just showed me actually get delivered to you? browser? cli?
[06:32:21] <molt> CLI
[06:35:13] <Byteflux> Those instructions don't seem to mention anything about compatibility with an existing installation. So you may have to uninstall 7.2 completely before installing 7.4 from the other repository.

[06:41:45] <rveerman> then re-run the 1st yum command of course
[06:42:36] <Blondie101010> molt:  the first step is to remove the current packages (something like `yum remove "php*"`), then you follow a tutorial on installing Remi's repo
[06:43:09] <Blondie101010> I've seen that quite a few times
[06:43:16] <Byteflux> Blondie101010: So I was right? Not a bad guess :P
[06:43:27] <Blondie101010> it's because of a change in IUS less than a year ago
[06:49:08] <Blondie101010> molt:  a bit more precisely, I start with `yum list installed "php*" > yum.php.txt`, then edit it to do the install once the repo is installed
[06:50:02] <Blondie101010> oh and be careful with your php.ini

[13:53:29] <The_Blode_> Hey guys, quick question, is this valid PHP
[13:54:07] <The_Blode_> Assuming var is an integer. $var = $_POST['test']; if ($var == 1) { }
[13:54:27] <The_Blode_> Will var be treated as a string from the POST array?
[13:55:12] <stenno> try with === instead of == and you have your answer
[13:55:25] <The_Blode_> === will check for data type too
[13:55:27] <Naktibalda> The_Blode_: https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.type-juggling.php
[13:55:53] <stenno> The_Blode_: i thought that was what you were asking
[13:56:04] <The_Blode_> My bad. I messed up my example.
[13:56:09] <Naktibalda> in your example string will be converted to number
[13:56:39] <The_Blode_> Say if I pass a string, will PHP warn me?
[13:56:47] <The_Blode_> If it tries to convert to numeric
[13:56:59] <stenno> no, it will return false
[13:57:06] <stenno> with ===
[13:57:07] <Naktibalda> everything in $_POST is either string or array
[13:57:14] <The_Blode_> Got it
[13:57:38] <The_Blode_> So in that scenario, given my POST variable is given as a string representation of 1...what will happen with $var == 1
[13:57:41] <Naktibalda> your IDE and static analysis tools may warn you.
[13:57:50] <stenno> The_Blode_: it will be true
[13:57:51] <The_Blode_> Well, it gets converted from string 1 to numeric integer 1 right?
[13:58:01] <stenno> yes, as given by Naktibalda 's link
[13:58:09] <The_Blode_> Thanks guys for the clarification
[13:58:35] <Naktibalda> https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.numeric-strings.php

[15:30:51] <lenarhoyt> Hello, when I set_time_limit(0) for a pg_get_notify, I somehow cannot call any other script anymore that starts a session from the same browser session. It simply times out. What could be causing this issue?
[15:31:43] <Naktibalda> session locking

[15:41:07] <freeman_h> a method has been incorrectly name for the last 7 years in one of the applications we are turning into a api(moving the code over and then doing the changes, etc). It needs to be rename to what it should actually be called. I can do a find and replace however for devs creating other classes, the will call this method thinking it still exist. I was wondering if php has an annotation similar to @deprecated for something like this
[15:42:47] <Naktibalda> php has no annotations :)
[15:43:59] <Naktibalda> if you want to get something useful at the runtime, you must keep the method and either make it throw exception, or call a new method and log message about deprecation.
[15:45:47] <DevAntoine> Naktibalda: false, php now has annotations!

[17:47:42] <alien_lappy> so, i'm looking to convert/promote an object into one of it's subclasses, but i looked around and i couldn't find anything; am i correct to assume that it is not possible to promote object to subclass?
[17:50:14] <alien_lappy> class Foo {}; class Bar extends Foo {}; $a = new Foo(); /* some magic to make $a into Bar() subclass? */ ; $a instanceof Bar === TRUE
[17:52:02] <Naktibalda> there is no such magic
[17:52:17] <alien_lappy> i guess i can make a static function in Bar::convertFromFoo($foo) { /* do a new Bar() here and try to copy everything over and do all the constructor does? */ }
[17:52:56] <Naktibalda> it is a bit odd that Foo has enough information for creation of Foo
[17:53:10] <Naktibalda> Square::createFromShape() would make no sense
[17:53:37] <Naktibalda> it is a bit odd that Foo has enough information for creation of Bar
[17:54:18] <alien_lappy> well, it does not, that's why if to do this, the Bar constructor would be needed, but without it's parent constructors
[17:54:20] <alien_lappy> ugh
[17:54:31] <alien_lappy> and it cannot be another subclass already
[17:54:33] <biberu> that sounds like a design issue
[17:54:38] <biberu> why do you need this?
[17:55:31] <alien_lappy> right now i just make a Bar with 5 args that are just the 5 properties from Foo
[17:55:39] <biberu> why?
[17:56:00] <biberu> if you can explain the context someone might be able to suggest a better solution
[17:56:17] <alien_lappy> because when creating Foo it's not yet known which subclass we need with the info that is in Foo
[17:56:24] <biberu> why?
[17:56:35] <alien_lappy> ok, so, this is a module system, so the subclass is not even loaded yet
[17:57:05] <Naktibalda> it looks like Foo should be a factory class and not a parent
[17:57:16] <alien_lappy> it is not a parent atm
[17:57:46] <alien_lappy> but i figured why am i doing in constructor of Bar: $this->prop1 = $prop1; 5 times
[17:58:38] <alien_lappy> myeah, i'll just let it be how it's now

[18:25:12] <alien_lappy> myeah, i guess so
[18:26:45] <TernaryOperator> I mean it's sorta odd but nothing would prevent you doing $getShape = Shape::make(10) // return Square which is subclass of Shape, Shape::make(10,20) // return Rectangle which is a subclass of Shape, Shape::make(10,20,30) // return Cube which is subclass of Shape
