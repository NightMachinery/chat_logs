[16:15:39] <_moep_> hey! is in logstash something like the following line valid: if [message] =~ "FOO bar" or "foo bar" {
[16:16:17] <beorn_> Yes
[16:16:40] <_moep_> so it match on uppercase,too?
[16:17:16] <beorn_> But you need either "if [message] =~ /(FOO bar|foo bar)/" or possibly "if [message] =~ /foo bar/i" 
[16:17:29] <beorn_> The "i" _might_ make it case indifferent
[16:17:51] <beorn_> Check the documentation
[16:18:35] <_moep_> ok and is there a way to brake a grok filter over two lines? (e.g. like in bash with \ )
[16:19:09] <beorn_> Not sure. Take a look at the many examples in the official documentation.
[16:19:42] <_moep_> ok thx and great do some people are here answering :) :D
[16:19:55] <_moep_> have a nice weekend ^^
[16:20:59] <beorn_> Grok can have multiple match filters, and you can put them on separate lines, but I'm not sure about breaking a single filter into multiple lines.
[16:24:30] <_moep_> beorn_: just imagine you are using a exim logfile and when you want to use good variablenames, your pattern is long and longer then 120 chars
[16:24:45] <beorn_> Yeah
[16:24:53] <beorn_> Nothing in Logstash cares about line length
[16:25:38] <_moep_> but its easier for maintance (like: "oh I wrote it wrong")
[16:30:21] <beorn_> Sure
