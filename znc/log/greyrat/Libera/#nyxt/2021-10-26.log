[00:12:07] <kagevf> is there any documentation for repeat mode? I tried reading https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/article/process-mode-and-repeat-mode.org but I was wondering if there was something a little more in-depth?
[00:12:15] <kagevf> also, how do you *stop* repeat mode?

[07:42:16] <xaltsc> Hey, I'm updating the package for voidlinux, should we download the source from nyxt.atlas.engineer or from github ?
[07:43:06] <xaltsc> Nevermind, the template is old and the link on the website actually points to github
[07:57:45] *** Joins: uniquepointer (~uniquepoi@190.218.240.164)
[08:13:33] <xaltsc> I might need help making the template, I think I'm experiencing thishttps://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/issues/1816 with the 2.2.1 tarball
[08:16:47] <xaltsc> Even though this PR is merged https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/commit/d8ca39519f634b7353fada949577cfb4fec313cc
[08:29:45] <xaltsc> I guess the problem is that, when compiling using the tarball, the extracted dir is not a git repo therefore the makefile cannot fetch submodules

[21:22:18] <xaltsc> jmercouris: It's possible, but against "quality requirements".
[21:22:30] <jmercouris> not sure why that would make it lower quality
[21:22:43] <jmercouris> well, this stupid bug in github of not including submodules is unlikely to get fixed soon
[21:22:49] <jmercouris> we could definitely make it part of our build script though
[21:22:54] <jmercouris> I saw that Pierre replied to you on GitHub
[21:25:03] <jmercouris> perhaps he will do it, he is a bit of the build script master that I am not
[21:25:18] <jmercouris> hello everyone, new newsletter: https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/article/newsletter-01.org
[21:25:18] <xaltsc> jmercouris: Yeah, that's what they me told this morning (CES?T), perhaps I can post a message on #voidlinux if someone is willing to help
[21:25:34] <xaltsc> they told me*
[21:25:49] <jmercouris> who is "they"?
[21:25:53] <jmercouris> the void linux people?
[21:26:10] <xaltsc> quinq, who is amongst the void linux people :D
[21:26:53] <jmercouris> I see
[21:27:13] <jmercouris> yeah I think the best bet would be for Pierre to make it such that we produce a tarball as well
[21:27:14] <jmercouris> with all the deps
[21:27:25] <jmercouris> I remember another void linux user requesting this in the past, a few years ago
[21:27:25] <nimaje> is there no release tarball?
[21:27:33] <jmercouris> nimaje: there is, but it doesn't include our submodules
[21:27:37] <jmercouris> which are necessary for Nyxt to compile
[21:31:13] <xaltsc> btw, since our timezones coincide, is normal that on the latest release, I get "** (nyxt:22608): ERROR **: 20:00:35.789: GApplication is required for xdg-desktop-portal access in the WebKit sandbox." when trying to accesss some website ?
[21:32:36] <jmercouris> xaltsc: hm, yes and no
[21:32:39] <jmercouris> it is normal, but not good
[21:32:46] <jmercouris> this is a common E R R O R
[21:32:52] <jmercouris> becuase of W E B K I T
[21:32:57] <jmercouris> let me see if I can find the issue
[21:33:15] <jmercouris> xaltsc: https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/issues/1799
[21:33:53] <jmercouris> of course, as linked in that thread, there is also: https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/issues/1781
[21:33:54] <xaltsc> jmercouris: is it safe with WEBKIT_FORCE_SANDBOX=0 ?
[21:34:01] <jmercouris> xaltsc: depends
[21:34:06] <jmercouris> if you containerize Nyxt, fine
[21:34:10] <jmercouris> otherwise, I wouldn't do it
[21:34:24] <jmercouris> yes, containerization and sandboxing are orthogonal concepts
[21:34:25] <jmercouris> I know
[21:34:41] <xaltsc> You mean running nyxt inside docker ?
[21:34:47] <jmercouris> I ran Nyxt without a sandbox for years, but YMMV, if you don't understand the security implications, I would not do it
[21:34:53] <jmercouris> I meant a firejail, or a ZFS jail
[21:35:01] <xaltsc> :(
[21:35:07] <jmercouris> so, leave the sandbox on
[21:35:14] <jmercouris> get the error, and we'll fix it soon :-D
[21:35:26] <jmercouris> there is a pull request to fix this error, just unmerged
[21:35:32] <jmercouris> decisions, decisions, decisions
[21:35:40] <xaltsc> thanks :D
[21:35:47] <jmercouris> also, don't forget, have a wonderful tomato tuesday
[21:35:56] <jmercouris> of course I extend that to everyone
[21:36:00] <jmercouris> have a happy tomato tuesday!
[21:37:04] <xaltsc> ????? (what's a "tomato tuesday" ????)
[21:37:08] <nimaje> those "Source code" links on the github release page? I throught they where only autogenerated archives of the source on that tag, some(/most?) times you want some more steps for a release tarball and normally you want stable checksums (github sometimes rerolls the tarballs)
[21:37:55] <jmercouris> xaltsc: today is tomato tuesday
[21:37:59] <jmercouris> we celebrate the tomato today
[21:38:07] <jmercouris> for example, yesterday was macaroon monday
[21:38:10] <jmercouris> we celebrated macaroons then
[21:38:21] <jmercouris> and before anyone says anything, macaraoons are a fruit
[21:38:26] <jmercouris> or so I tell myself, because they are delicious
[21:38:27] <xaltsc> I'm from Tomato Europe and I'm French, so okay I guess ?????
[21:38:37] <jmercouris> xaltsc: magnifique
[21:38:54] <jmercouris> since you are french I can only assume you had a wonderful macaroon monday
[21:39:04] <jmercouris> Pierre is also french if you prefer talking in french with him
[21:39:15] <jmercouris> nimaje: yes, those

[22:23:13] <waleee> xaltsc: it's a bit ironic that the pre-git submodules version was ok in void-packages since that pulled in stuff during the build too (via quicklisp)
[22:28:15] <waleee> but I imagine that the gentoo-afficionados would be very happy with a submodule bundled tarball since emerge ebuilds explicitly block network connections during build time
[22:33:43] <xaltsc> waleee: from what I understand, it's just that git submodules init won't succeed since the tarball is not a git repo, but pulling stuff is not forbidden, if it succeeds, as long as it is hidden enough (although maybe it should?)
