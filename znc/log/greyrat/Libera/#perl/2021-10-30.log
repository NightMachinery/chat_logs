[01:57:33] <gordonfish> Tip of the day. If someone asks you for help with something called 'Call Accounting Mate', run and don't look back. 1) Requires IE for the management interface, 2) Try to see the last log requires waiting for it to load the entire log file in the browser (for me it was 5+ years worth...), 3) tons of random do-you-want-to-debug errors simply because IE was blocking pop ups from the web app. 4) Also doesn't work well in IE > 8.x

[05:14:35] <daemon> mst, not yet I am actually doing some old school https://i.imgur.com/mNe6g5Z.jpg planning, but I am basing my latest project in perl I could use plx for it
[05:15:06] <daemon> infact lets see how it installs in WSL :)
[05:17:13] <daemon> ok first critism the perldoc appears to say why to use it but not really the installation procedure, it involves perlbrew but never really says that is a different thing if I was a new user I would have no idea what the hell that was
[05:17:17] <mst> fair enough :D
[05:17:31] <mst> it still doesn't involve perlbrew
[05:19:16] <daemon> https://i.imgur.com/oAvh58a.png
[05:19:35] <daemon> that probably wants to be a bit further down :) at least in my opinion
[05:19:45] <daemon> a synopsis should show the most basic example of getting it working
[05:20:54] <daemon> even the quickstart, kicks off with a git clone, which is not a perl thing at all
[05:21:18] <daemon> I would expect it started with making an empty directory and working from there
[05:22:59] <daemon> so if you was to approach this application lets say for instance you are either a new user or you are in a stack that still uses cvs or svn - the documentation helped you naught
[05:23:54] <mst> I see, yeah
[05:24:09] <mst> I think honestly it needs an introduction and a cookbook
[05:24:26] <daemon> cookbooks dood we need those, poe.perl.org is awesome for that and we need more of it
[05:24:37] <mst> though I -would- point out the SYNOPSIS is exactly what a 'man page' synopsis normally looks like
[05:24:41] *** Quits: Su-Shee (~Susanne@p4ff4981c.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[05:25:04] <daemon> yeah but your POD relies on quite a bit of 'other' non core applications perlbrew, git and others
[05:25:08] <mst> that's the tension here, you're judging the synopsis as a cpan synopsis, but it's a command line tool so I wrote a man page synopsis
[05:25:09] <daemon> I know what they are, not everyone would
[05:25:41] <mst> yes, the WHY PLX should explain that better
[05:25:50] <mst> the SYNOPSIS however is 100% correct as a -man page- synopsis
[05:26:05] <mst> there needs to be an INTRO that then links to a more detailed tutorial
[05:26:07] <daemon> as true as that is and it is absolutely true

[05:26:44] <daemon> depending on your style preference but it should be somewhere
[05:27:29] <mst> I think I want to put that into an '=head1 INTRO' or QUICKSTART
[05:27:49] <mst> this is meant to speak to people who're root on BSD machines, the SYNOPSIS has to be a real command line tool synopsis
[05:28:10] <mst> the aesthetic is important in that regard
[05:28:22] <daemon> I mean to be fair we was talking about cookbook recipes last time, and possible having them as suck in module examples for plx, there is no defined way to do that right now and when I was chatting to ... Grinnz might have been I raised the comment that a wiki might be a good approach for such a thing, so people could create articles that are matched to the name of their modules and have pullable .example or .cookbook files
[05:28:40] <mst> plugins will also be useful but a different thing
[05:28:47] <daemon> if you want to reach people who are BSD and perl people you are dealing with a very small audience
[05:28:49] <mst> pullable files require another layer
[05:29:37] <mst> I'm currently working on a better approach to rich shareable config files that will help a lot there
[05:29:47] <mst> plx is the suckless-minimalist thing for in the meantime

[05:30:06] <daemon> well its not really that minimalist it involves perlbrew and git :)
[05:30:25] <daemon> at least via that is what is portrated
[05:30:29] <daemon> portrayed *
[05:31:58] <daemon> it seems that you are designing a tool that will be very helpful but the backing infra is not quite there for it yet
[05:32:00] <mst> ok, ok, the quickstart shows how to use it for development
[05:32:04] <mst> because it's a tool for developers
[05:32:39] <daemon> well yes being able to swap to different projects and have your env setup for you is normally setup.sh in the project root :P
[05:32:45] <daemon> its a good idea
[05:33:16] <mst> echo 'eval $(plx --env)' >setup.sh; # done :P
[05:33:47] <mst> I just prefer doing 'plx foo'
[05:34:06] <genio> funny how   `pacman -S base-devel` makes a world of difference.
[05:34:10] * genio facepalms
[05:34:19] <daemon> :)
[05:34:33] <mst> but you're right, I should produce a version of the QUICKSTART that is for a new project where you start with 'mkdir'
[05:34:38] <daemon> see that is why you want gentoo or freebsd, then you already have your base libs >:)
[05:34:41] <mst> I just always start with 'mkdir' then 'git init'
[05:34:59] <genio> I _might_ be where I can now build on Msys2
[05:35:08] <daemon> mst, who does'nt, but people don't people have restrictions and ancient stacks and other crap
[05:35:19] <mst> daemon: and it'd make a better intro anyway
[05:35:24] <mst> I basically documented all the features
[05:35:32] <mst> then threw together a "quickstart for how I use it"
[05:35:49] <mst> then I couldn't get anybody to even consider it so I wasn't sure what I'd missed
[05:35:57] <daemon> mst, it would also appeal massively to way more people if --init Net::FTP --cookbook client was a thing even if not many things supported it
[05:35:58] <mst> hence asking you, even if I'm being grumpy about it ;)
[05:36:08] <daemon> the ability to just drop a literal working example is a very powerful thing
[05:36:14] *** Quits: Michelle (~michelle@203.206.128.220) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[05:36:19] <mst> still not a core plx feature
[05:36:33] <daemon> I was more thinking gerneral community benefit
[05:36:37] <daemon> there is nothing that can do that
[05:36:38] <mst> but I do have plans and you should remind me of them later
[05:36:53] <mst> yes, and I'm going to build something that can, but that's not going to be in plx
[05:37:04] <daemon> hmm I am curious why
[05:37:13] <daemon> it seems it would be the appropriate tool
[05:37:26] <daemon> it is something to start a project from after all
[05:37:34] <mst> no it isn't
[05:37:45] <mst> it's a thing to run stuff within a project
[05:38:01] <mst> *managing* the project in rich ways is going to be a separate and heavier tool
[05:38:20] <daemon> so it is now something that has the focus for BSD people, who do perl, who want to run things that are contained within a project
[05:38:25] <mst> this is the *executor*
[05:38:31] <mst> I also intend to write the *manager*
[05:38:49] <daemon> ok that makes sense
[05:39:05] <mst> right now, it's basically "makes all the things that annoy me about having separate local::libs per checkout while working on multiple cpan modules at once stop annoying me so much"
[05:39:14] <daemon> it would allow things like vscode to have an expected application to tag onto for version control which would open up such interfaces
[05:39:17] *** Joins: Michelle (~michelle@203.206.128.220)
[05:41:33] <mst> but plx -itself- is intentionally a small tool with limitied scope

[05:42:06] <daemon> well it certainly works in debian/WSL2 :)
[05:42:11] <mst> :D
[05:42:55] <mst> but e.g. w/plx you use other tools to manage other things, like 'plx cpanm -ldevel ...' and etc.
[05:43:04] <daemon> speaking of weird windows stuff I wonder what perl is going to do on the upstairs box, windows 11
[05:43:55] <daemon> infact that is the one that had the issue with tarballs thinking about it
[05:44:05] <daemon> that it could not extract anything
[05:44:53] <daemon> this box will be windows 11 next month, I will probably flat format it - I should actually pay attention precisely to what is going on for if that is going to be a thing that becomes a problem
[05:45:35] <daemon> well that or just use WSL for everything
[05:45:46] <daemon> and stop trying to run things on windows directly ... which is looking tempting
[05:48:37] <daemon> oh hey mst you might know this, a curiosity if nothing else ... do you recall back in the CVS/CVSUP days where multiple tcp connections was multiplexed into a single one, I know that same thing is possible with websockets, I do not know to much abut HTTP/2.0 though is it possible to establish bi directional TCP connections muxed in a single client to server connection within the scope of the HTTP/2.0 spec - and if not what modern standard does allow 
[05:48:37] <daemon> such a thing
[05:50:13] <mst> there's plenty of websocket things that already do it
[05:50:48] <mst> muxing raw tcp connections is ... openssh already does that
[05:51:04] <mst> and I've not generally found alternative situations where I need that beyond those two
[05:52:05] <daemon> I could easily write my own proto to do it I was just hoping there was already something that say some pleb using PHP could connect to my service and deal with
[05:52:09] <daemon> it seems a bit niche though
[05:52:15] <daemon> that particular tech
[05:52:36] <mst> personally when I want something like that
[05:52:48] <mst> I use either lines-of-json or netstrings-of-json as the wire protocol
[05:52:51] <mst> specify an array
[05:53:00] <mst> and have the first entry be a connection identifier
[05:53:08] <daemon> well if you got json wire you can just tag a link_id for the objects
[05:53:41] <daemon> if you needed the speed could probably drop back a bit further and goto ProtoBuffer
[05:53:53] <mst> and if it's raw binary write the idea that there's a library that 'some pleb using PHP' is going to be able to use ever seems optimistic
[05:54:24] <daemon> ok that was a bit rude of me, some seasoned technical professional using php :)

[05:55:26] <daemon> I want to write something and I want other people to be able to use it without using perl, so I need to base it in http and use openapi to define it

[05:55:42] <mst> so websockets and asyncapi then
[05:56:13] <daemon> all my experience with werbsockets has led me to believe there bloody horrible in all languages
[05:56:23] <daemon> even though I understand they are in basis a csocket
[05:56:29] <mst> that's because you've never used a good websocket library
[05:56:48] <mst> spend a while with Mojo's client and server and you may change your mind

[05:58:01] <mst> you're missing out, it's a better language than python, php or ruby

[15:20:47] <LeoNerd> Yes.. don't use map in void context
[15:21:11] <zkrd> my $id = map { ... ?
[15:21:12] <LeoNerd> Also you probably wanted to use `first` from List::Util;   my $id = first { /data/ } keys $x->attr->%*;
[15:21:32] <zkrd> oh 
[15:21:39] <zkrd> I am not used to List::Util yet
[15:21:41] <LeoNerd> Though, that'll find you the -first- one whereas technically your previous version would find the final one
[15:21:53] <LeoNerd> That said, hashes are unordered so if multiple things match there's no guarantee which one you'll get

[19:56:37] <daemon> mst, oh hey I wanted to chat to you about something else as well and totally forgot, me and koobs (founder: #freebsd) was thinking about implementing a community type ban system - as I found out when I chatted to #openbsd it seems MetaNova (##bans) has already tried this - so dropped him a pm, but yeah freebsd's channel space with all its localization and sub projects is massive, 50+ channels; so trying to collect some channel owners together to see 
[19:56:37] <daemon> if we could figure out a way of making a beneficial bi-directional ban system that all channels can use safely and sanely, not plan is laid out at all at present just me trying collect a few channel owners to discuss the idea, would you be interested?
[19:59:04] <mst> such things have been tried before and there's enough of an issue around different spaces having different standards -and- people often behaving very differently in different contexts that I don't think you can do it quite that globally
[19:59:35] <mst> what has in practice worked is certain classes of -focused- ban sharing for types of behaviour that are definitely universally considered unacceptable
[20:00:14] <daemon> yeah that is the major concern, the general feeling is that if you ban dickhead!blah@wherever it should be local only, it should be a special bot that handles !ReallyDamnBan <thisperson>
[20:00:38] <daemon> but that is why there is no real plan and I am just trying to see if I can get a couple of channels to chat about it, see if we can come up with something
[20:01:12] <daemon> I think it was #netbsd came up with an interesting idea of having secondary sighning that is if someone tries to glob ban across the fleet, a different channels rep has to approve it
[20:01:15] <daemon> it cannot be singular
[20:01:23] <daemon> obviously relying on at least 10 channels being involved
[20:01:25] <mst> I think what you'd really want is somewhere where the behaviour gets shared with everybody who's federated in, and it only gets added to the shared list if there's broad consensus
[20:02:04] <mst> since even one unwanted ban on the shared list is likely going to cause people to deaffiliate
[20:03:09] <daemon> oh it would cause drama at some point things like this always do, but as an optimist I would hope it would bring communities closer together to work more closely for the greater good - I like to think that is how it would work!
[20:03:32] <daemon> It would work like that ... yes

[22:08:31] <Kobaz> mexijo: introspection into postgres views.. getting dependency lists. it's recursive
[22:10:35] <mst> ah, and then you basically jam the SELECT into an inlinable rowset returning function?
[22:10:58] <Kobaz> yeah
[22:11:19] <Kobaz> and then convert joins against some_other_view into join some_other_view()
[22:11:34] <mst> that sounds like the good sort of "surprisingly simple but only after you've implemented it"
[22:11:39] <Kobaz> yeah
[22:11:41] <Kobaz> it took a week to get right
[22:12:07] <Kobaz> i was previously regexing the view DDL, but then converted it to just use the list of view dependencies on other views
[22:12:36] <mst> which means you can poke the FROM clause with a stick much more reliably

[22:13:16] <Kobaz> yeah
[22:16:16] <Kobaz> views are one of the few things in postgres that's not fully MVCC so everything grinds to a halt when you try and drop one
[22:17:59] <mst> last time I dealt with this I took advantage of the fact that views compile by oid so you can rename, CREATE the replacement, and then wait for all outstanding transactions to finish so everything's referencing the new one and then drop the old ones without issue
[22:18:42] *** Joins: G_SabinoMullane (~G_SabinoM@pool-72-94-251-236.phlapa.fios.verizon.net)
[22:19:19] <Kobaz> the problem is. we have like 5000 views
[22:19:22] <Kobaz> which takes a while...
[22:19:43] <Kobaz> so the time taken by rename/create will still block things up
[22:21:39] <mst> I've not tried it with that many views but the rename/create cycles were pretty bloody fast per-view
[22:25:35] <Kobaz> we need to do it in one large transaction for consistency
[22:25:39] <Kobaz> it adds up...
[22:26:16] <Kobaz> if the view-function approach wasn't going to work my next approach was to add full MVCC to views in postgre
[22:26:21] *** Parts: jabberwok (~wlindley@75.105.20.104) ()
[22:26:55] <Kobaz> cache the views for full use in the transaction while another one completely rips them apart until an atomic commit
[22:28:11] <Kobaz> and then just move the one cache pointer to the new cache
[22:28:23] <Kobaz> and poof now you have all the new views.. at least in theory
[22:29:24] <mst> Kobaz: the other trick is you CREATE them all under new names then do just the RENAMEs inside the tx
[22:29:46] <mst> how much that would help I've not checked
