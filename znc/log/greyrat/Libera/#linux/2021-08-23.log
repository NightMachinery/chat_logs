[00:38:57] <Sauvin> neshpion, it's a rather subjective valuation, but it's more powerful in terms of bang-per-buck than assmebly language in most cases, but less so under some circumstances than (oh, say...) haskell or prolog.

[00:52:23] <phogg> matsaman: Type hinting, which is then enforced by the compiler or interpreter, is helpful because it is another form of limitation you can ask the computer to impose on you. When you ask for those kinds of limitations it is because you recognize that doing so yields better results.
[00:52:39] <Sauvin> It could be said that assembly is the only language that ever made any sense to me, too, but I'll be double-dipped in hot steaming fudge if I'll try to write one-off scripts in it!
[00:52:48] <matsaman> I don't think it necessarily yields better results
[00:52:53] <matsaman> it does necessarily take longer to type

[10:22:43] <Praxis> ayecee Hey can we tell if the my server is just losing power or if it's shutting down first? Because I came across an issue someone reported with the IPMI system activating watchdog, which restarts the system. And my IPMI is kinda screwed up. But in that scenario it would do a full shutdown.

[10:23:42] <mlu> Praxis: you can't really :)
[10:24:08] <Praxis> mlu gosh darnit!
[10:24:09] <deniska> Praxis: assuming a watchdog identifies a system as non-responding, it would do a reset not bothering with proper shutdowns?
[10:24:31] <deniska> Praxis: I'd expect a watchdog to have some sort of off-system log on fancier servers
[10:24:37] <mlu> Praxis: on a modern system, you should actually just assume that a clean shutdown is impossible anyways
[10:24:41] <Praxis> deniska well, there goes a good theory.
[10:24:58] <mlu> put it this way: if clean shutdowns mattered, the system is misdesigned anyways
[10:25:29] <Praxis> Well then it's either the power distro board, or watchdog being weird
[10:25:37] <mlu> so unless you're running some sort of legacy system or an old design, don't care about it too much ;)
[10:25:54] <mlu> Praxis: well, did it feed the watchdog?
[10:26:03] <Praxis> The problem is I can't mess wit hthe IPMI because I updated it and it doesn't accept passwords, including the default

[13:24:50] <joo> how can i make sure that a usb drive is mounted like a real drive and changes are reflected instantly like on a real hdd and doesnt require me to run sync? is that even possible and advisable ?
[13:25:44] <Wulf> joo: real hdds use write caches too. If you disconnect it, you'll have data loss just the same.
[13:26:34] <Wulf> joo: there is a "sync" mount option. Don't use it.
[13:26:39] <IDontKnowWhatThe> Hi guys! I have a problem and need your help. Somebody created user on server and when i login to this user i just get # prompt. THe interesting thing is that if i do whoami i get "root". But I made login as user. I changed the shell to bash and copied bashrc from /etc/skel. I still dont understand how switch to root happens
[13:26:53] <Wulf> joo: or you can set dirty ratio to 0 or tune other kernel parameters. Don't.

[13:31:35] <Sauvin> No reason you should.
[13:31:46] <lopid> the equivalent of turning it off and on again
[13:32:10] <Sauvin> If you're comfortable editing /etc/passwd, replace both zeroes for that user's entry to some UID that no other user is using.

[13:32:36] <IDontKnowWhatThe> i hate this customer
[13:32:40] <Sauvin> And find out what boneheaded lunk created that user and light a fire under his bohinkies.
[13:32:43] <Wulf> IDontKnowWhatThe: or use the usermod command to change things.
[13:33:16] <lopid> if you try to recover manually, don't forget about /etc/skel
[13:33:17] <IDontKnowWhatThe> so the id of 0 is the reason system automatically thinks i'm root?

[18:01:50] <goddard> SineDeviance: using an LG CX which is an OLED 4k 120hz display
[18:02:02] <goddard> it looks great on windows and looks decent on linux but not as good
[18:02:07] <SineDeviance> As well as the hundreds of 14" 1080p client laptops I support
[18:02:23] <goddard> it is highly dependent on display
[18:02:37] <djph> whatever the default font in awesomewm is, is rock solid.  though the screen isn't 4k (2256x1504)
[18:02:37] <SineDeviance> goddard: I have the same TV, yeah. Windows fonts are a little blurry on it at 4k with 300% scale.
[18:02:47] <SineDeviance> Mine is the 55-inch versin
[18:02:49] <goddard> SineDeviance: i only go to 150%

[18:03:33] <SineDeviance> Yeah, do this - set your resolution at 1080p and make the font scaling 125% or 150%, you may see the blur
[18:03:41] <SineDeviance> I am used to it, it just stands out to me at this point
[18:03:59] *** leftyfb_ is now known as leftyfb
[18:04:00] <djph> well, sure, if you're setting a non-native resolution on an lcd, you're going to get blur
[18:04:01] <goddard> the display technically has a resolution a step higher then 4k

[18:04:22] <SineDeviance> The best desktop environment I have found for fractional scaling is KDE so far, it looks great scaled on 10-foot displays
[18:04:25] <goddard> gives a 9:5 option
[18:04:42] <goddard> 4096x2160p
[18:04:54] <guffiardon> Tom^ your fonts look big on my screen
[18:04:57] <swarfega> what about 3840x1200 lol
[18:05:06] <SineDeviance> <djph> well, sure, if you're setting a non-native resolution on an lcd, you're going to get blur <-- no, 1920x1080 is exactly half of 4k's resolution, instead of blur it should just quadruple each pixel
[18:05:09] <Tom^> guffiardon: i guess its because im running that res on a 15" monitor heh
[18:05:09] <goddard> SineDeviance: yeah KDE is great for fractional scaling but their intergration with Gnome sucks
[18:05:11] <fakuve> Hi guys , hope you are doing well like Manuel . I'm just figuring out one thing. So If I have a VPS in which I'm running `mutt` and other terminal utilities , but some of them they refer to `html` links so I want to open those up in my client-host with `firefox-esr` , Do you reckon a way to sort of like execute the links remotely? (while connected on a SSH session to this server) . Cause if I were to install a
[18:05:13] <fakuve> whole X11 server in the VPS just to run this is a bit of an overkill. Any thoughts? Thanks

[18:07:20] <esselfe> So I decided to build myself a generic kernel in case I have to switch the disk onto another machine. I selected most of the drivers as modules 918 of them and I'm now wondering about the initramfs that I'll generate with dracut. How would a typical --add-drivers list? Like do I only include PCI, VGA and disk drivers?
[18:07:23] <ananke> fakuve: either way, you can google to see if mutt can be configured to use lynx as an external viewer for http/https links
[18:07:24] <SineDeviance> I have my gaming rig setup with the TV all the time. I have an RTX 2070 Super so it can do 4k60 over HDMI and maybe 4k120 with displayport, but I always run it at 1080p 120hz

[19:07:00] <peetaur> you can't conclude nothing is wrong with your test until you make sense of the results
[19:07:34] <SkunkyLaptop> Ballerburg9005: traffic shaping can be pretty complex, so it depends on how you're deciding which traffic to throttle, what queue you're using.....
[19:07:45] <peetaur> and it's probably a question for #networking
[19:08:17] <Ballerburg9005> peetaur: I did set up traffic shaping many times before, I know it is something dumb like having to load certain modules by hand or flipping a switch in /sys/

[20:24:01] <NJ_Guy> Hello.  I'm running Manjaro KDE Plasma and am using the Remmina remote desktop application.  Sometimes in my panel I see a microphone icon, even when I'm not using the microphone.  When I hover my mouse over it, its says "freerdp is using the microphone".  Any idea why?  I dont use the microphone at all for remote desktop.  I can right-click it and select Mute, but wondering what the root cause is, or how to troublshoot it.  Thanks.
