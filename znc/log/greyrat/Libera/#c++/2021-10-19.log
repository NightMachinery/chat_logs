[18:33:24] <zz> depends on what A really is.
[18:34:23] <tin-> A is a qt application
[18:34:25] <zz> but there's also a basic rule: don't assume transitive dependencies. If you need X, link X. Don't rely on Y to bring X in, because it may not.
[18:34:36] <tin-> B is a tests for that qt application
[18:34:53] <tin-> A uses library C, which is statically linked to A
[18:34:55] <urdh> I doubt B is linking against the actual executable A here
[18:35:06] <urdh> that sounds very unorthodox
[18:35:21] <zz> and if A is an application, you don't really link to it. Not even if it's PIE. And don't get me started on -rdynamic crap.

[18:36:51] <zz> urdh: if coffee didn't fix it yet, more won't fix it either. Switch to tea perhaps?
[18:37:00] <zz> Oh cool, an XY problem.
[18:37:01] <zz> The XY problem: You want to do X, but don't know how. You think you can solve it using Y, but don't know how to do that, either. You ask about Y, which is a strange thing to want to do. Just ask about X.
[18:37:08] <tin-> I wrote an sql api/later for my qt application, which uses QxOrm for the ORM. - so that is application A, and QxOrm is lib B (in this case)

[18:37:30] <tin-> sorry, QxOrm is (C)
[18:37:34] <zz> for an outside observer, there is no way to reliably see whether A is using QxOrm or not
[18:37:53] <tin-> now when I build my app, QxOrm (C) links against my app (A).
[18:38:08] <tin-> I have another separate app, app-tests (B), which depends on my app (A)
[18:38:16] <tin-> so A will be built first, then B.
[18:38:34] <zz> B has no symbol dependency on A, just a simple "does it exist" dependency perhaps.
[18:38:45] <tin-> but then B needs to use QxOrm to setup the db, make the connection and the tables, but I want to use the API from A to test its methods..

[18:40:18] <zz> (or vice versa!)
[18:40:54] <urdh> i hope these are some sort of integration tests
[18:40:59] <tin-> hm. ok. but now app-test needs to use those functions from A, but also needs QxOrm to setup the db.
