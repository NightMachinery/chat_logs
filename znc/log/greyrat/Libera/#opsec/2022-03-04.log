[02:20:55] <Joanna> It’s kind of funny how people worry about privacy yet allow themselves to be tracked and registered in just about all faucets of their lives. If people really cared about privacy they could start by having their babies at home and not registering them and working only for cash .
[02:33:17] <_inky> if you want to know what I think, that's the interview with Harari I completely agree with: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQqthbvYE8M

[09:15:03] <Joanna> Hi everyone
[09:18:15] <Joanna> _inky: the things happening in Ukraine are easy to understand if you follow the money. War is very profitable for weapons manufacturers and news media. The people selling weapons will happily sell as much military equipment as possible to the governments donating them to Ukraine which happens to be a puppet government of the country with the largest prison population in the world.
[09:22:33] <Joanna> The people who started this think wars are great and can’t stop starting them . I can’t remember a time when civilians in some country or another being mass murdered by the same interests that made this war happen.
[09:23:46] <Joanna> Weren’t being murdered that is. There has always been wars just like this one with innocent people being obliterated.
[09:30:10] <Joanna> That being said maybe Putin is a puppet and was given the green light to invade Ukraine just like saddam Hussein was told it was ok to invade Kuwait because they were slant drilling and then vilified him. Nothing is ever as it seems details are always hidden.
