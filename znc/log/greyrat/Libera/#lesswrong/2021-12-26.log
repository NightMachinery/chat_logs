[00:48:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> That #1 on that list is somehow simultaneously adorable and terrifying
[00:48:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: ^ you will enjoy (?) this too
[00:48:48] <pompolic> rat sitcom?
[00:48:58] <pompolic> i know
[00:49:03] <pompolic> call it Always Sunny in Berkeley
[00:49:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok I'm gonna try and quote it, this is too good not to
[00:50:47] <pompolic> got to the "punchline" i think
[00:50:48] <pompolic> lolololo
[00:51:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> So the context is, Jessica Taylor is tripping balls, she's taken a bunch of acid and not slept for like four days straight, she's staying at a friend's house where people are concerned about how fucked up she is... and so:
[00:51:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Zack Davis gave me a math test: could I prove e^œÄi + 1=0? I gave a geometric argument: "e^ix means spinning x radians clockwise about the origin in the complex plane starting from 1", and I drew a corresponding diagram. Zack said this didn't show I could do math, since I could have remembered it, and asked me to give an algebraic argument. I failed to give one (and I think I would have failed pre-psychosis as well). He told
[00:51:53] <Obormot\Arcturus>  me that I should have used the Taylor series expansion of e^x.  I believe this exchange was used to convince other people taking care of me that I was unable to do math, which was unreasonable given the difficulty of the problem and the lack of calibration on an easier problem."
[00:52:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> (The Taylor series expansion! Which is her name!! IRONY)
[00:53:15] <kuudes> what
[00:53:27] <kuudes> which of them is more tripping balls
[00:53:40] <kuudes> this sounds like "this is bat country"
[00:54:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Indeed... this is the kind of shit that would never even make it into the sitcom because it's so insane
[00:54:57] <pompolic> also, couldn't you just throw euler's identity at it and work out something?
[00:55:10] <pompolic> maybe taylor series is where you'd end up
[00:55:12] <pompolic> i am bad at math
[00:55:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> And yet it's also cute (and impressive); *I* couldn't give you a proof of e^œÄi + 1 = 0 *right now* and I'm completely sober! Meanwhile here's Jessica who's actively hallucinating and has had no sleep for multiple days and she's just "yeah nbd here's a proof"
[00:56:54] <pompolic> actually
[00:57:07] <rmmh> Obormot\Arcturus: is this rat drama
[00:57:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> " (Days later, I tested myself with programming ‚ÄúFizzBuzz‚Äù and was highly distressed to find that my program was malfunctioning and I couldn‚Äôt successfully debug it, with my two eyes seeming to give me different pictures of the computer screen.)" ... oh no :( ... but on the other hand, she shouldn't feel bad, many programmers can't do a FizzBuzz
[00:57:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> rmmh: Of course. Scroll up, I linked
[00:58:05] <pompolic> if i were better at math, i would *probably* instantly visualize e^pi*i as a rotation, reducing the problem to having to describe the picture
[00:58:48] <pompolic> maybe she does math visually too?
[00:59:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Ben Hoffman opened the door which let sunlight into the doorway. I took it as an invitation and stepped outside. The light was wonderful, giving me perhaps the most ecstatic experience I have had in my life, as I sensed light around my mind, and I felt relieved from being covered up. I expounded on the greatness of the sunlight, referencing Sarah‚Äôs post on Ra." ... as one does. In another place and time she could've segued
[00:59:22] <Obormot\Arcturus>  from her MIRI job straight into an exciting new career as a sun priestess
[00:59:49] <rmmh> maybe taking a bunch of hallucinogens is bad, actually
[01:00:09] <pompolic> still impressive but i can kind of see how you could generate that specific proof even when sleep deprived, especially if you're on acid lol
[01:00:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> rmmh: Crazy talk. Literally no evidence for that. Why would you even suggest
[01:00:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I was very anxious and peed on a couch at some point and, when asked why, replied that I was ‚Äútrying to make things worse‚Äù." ... seems legit, yeah

[01:04:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like what if instead of taking a bunch of drugs, Jessica hadn't taken a bunch of drugs? Wouldn't this story be very mundane then? Wouldn't it just be "MIRI leadership was kind of incompetent and dumb in various ways"? Which, don't get me wrong, is worth talking about, but it would, at any rate, be a much *shorter* post...
[01:06:12] <pompolic> based on my experience of teetering near such states, i think it's very easy to see malintent where isn't, become fixated on malintent, and that kind of sticking around
[01:06:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I had tried psychedelics before talking significantly with Michael, in part due to a statement I heard from a friend (who wasn‚Äôt a CFAR employee but who did some teaching at CFAR events) along the lines of ‚ÄúCFAR can‚Äôt legally recommend that you try [a specific psychedelic], but...‚Äù (I don‚Äôt remember what followed the ‚Äúbut‚Äù), and in part due to suggestions from other friends." ... THESE ARE NOT GOOD REASONS TO
[01:06:31] <Obormot\Arcturus>  TRY PSYCHEDELICS
[01:06:32] <pompolic> (which is consistent with Scott analogizing psychosis to brain fire)
[01:07:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> pompolic: Yes, sure, I agree with that, but there's a lot of daylight between "ugh, what if my coworkers are doing [things] on purpose, and are actually bad people" and ... all this nonsense
[01:08:14] <pompolic> i agree with that also
[01:08:43] <pompolic> but, hmm
[01:09:42] <pompolic> i think there's also a knock-on effect of overestimating the significance/relevance of people/events around you to whatever big brain idea you're thinking of
[01:10:34] <pompolic> just spuriously connecting things to each other all the time
[01:10:51] <kuudes> I mean, psychedelics instead of suicide sound reasonable, but maybe not quite much before that
[01:11:04] <pompolic> i'm pretty sure schizophrenia has a tendency like this, but maybe just psychosis itself does too
[01:11:09] <pompolic> and this too can linger IMO
[01:11:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Could Michael Vassar have orchestrated all this? That would be incredibly unlikely, requiring him to scheme so well that he determines the behavior of many others while having very little direct contact with me at the time of psychosis. If he is Xanatos, directing the entire social scene I was part of through hidden stratagems, that would be incredibly unlikely on priors, and far out of line with how effective I have seen him
[01:11:14] <Obormot\Arcturus>  to be at causing people to cooperate with his intentions." ... ouch
[01:11:21] <pompolic> hard to update back to normal people territory
[01:11:37] <pompolic> rekt
[01:13:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> "In the context of MIRI, I was in a scientistic math cult^W ‚Äòhigh-enthusiasm ideological community‚Äô, so seeing outside the ideology of this cult^W ‚Äòcommunity‚Äô might naturally involve thinking about non-scientistic concepts; enforcing ‚Äútalking about auras and demons is a psychiatric emergency‚Äù would, accordingly, be enforcing cult^W ‚Äòlocal‚Äô ideological boundaries using state force vested in professional
[01:13:35] <Obormot\Arcturus>  psychiatrists for the purpose of protecting the public." ... lols
[01:15:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Scott Alexander has, at a Slate Star Codex meetup, said that Michael is a ‚Äúwitch‚Äù and/or does powerful ‚Äúwitchcraft‚Äù. This is clearly of the same kind as speech about ‚Äúauras‚Äù and ‚Äúdemons‚Äù." ... surely a "warlock", unless Michael has also transitioned and/or we're using the Harry Potter terminology, which of course would be terrible

[07:55:13] <quanticle> gwern: Western HUMINT in the USSR was as bad as Soviet SIGINT against the United States
[07:55:25] <gwern> indeed
[07:55:38] <gwern> such a weird imbalance
[07:56:03] <gwern> there is no law that there has to be parity. like, the US has bad SIGINT and no HUMINT on North Korea, and North Korea has neither
[07:57:52] <quanticle> What I don't understand is why the CIA thought that some random American student would even be allowed near Crimea which was then (as now) a major military colony. It's not as if we'd allow random Russian students to conduct a road trip through Joint Base Lewis McChord either.
[07:59:17] <gwern> it's fractally dumb
[07:59:53] <gwern> to the point where you have to seriously consider that maybe he's saying the story is incomplete because there actually was something important going on and the buffoonery was a distraction
[08:00:05] <gwern> and he's not just making up an excuse for being an idiot run by idiots
[08:00:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Unbeknown to Makinen, his Soviet road trip was being watched by KGB agents, and he was eventually arrested in Kyiv." ... what
[08:00:53] <quanticle> "However, 'I did not have a realistic image of what this trip would entail,' Makinen says. 'I was overly enthusiastic and insufficiently trained. I asked one of my contacts what to do if I was detained. ‚ÄòYou will have to wiggle out as best as you can‚Äô was the answer.' The officers gave Makinen a camera and funds for travel expenses, and he set off in a rented Volkswagen Beetle that summer,
[08:00:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> What do they mean, unbeknown
[08:00:55] <quanticle> after the semester had ended. He got as far as Kiev, where he was arrested on July 27, 1961."
[08:00:57] <quanticle> https://cen.acs.org/articles/91/i7/Chemistry-Spy-Story.html
[08:00:59] <quanticle> He's lucky he didn't end up like Otto Warmbier
[08:01:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> How... how did they not assume that he would be watched at all times???
[08:01:13] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: because he's an idiot run by idiots
[08:01:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The Soviet border guards made note of Makinen, then waved him through into Socialist Ukraine." ... did they not know what the Border Guards were???
[08:01:30] <quanticle> I think unbeknownst to Makinen, not unbeknownst to the agents running him?
[08:01:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> What the actual fuck is this story
[08:01:52] <gwern> a rational person would assume that not only would he be run 24/7, that he would've been exposed before he ever got to the border by all the moles and agents
[08:02:08] <gwern> what with germany being so incredibly riddled with east german and hence soviet sources
[08:02:19] <quanticle> Of course, this was 1961
[08:02:33] <quanticle> But, that said, 1961 is pretty late into the Cold War
[08:03:08] <gwern> quanticle: more than late enough to understand how thoroughly russian spies had penetrated everything, even if you were not cleared for the real hot shit like venona
[08:04:12] <quanticle> "'I was photographing barracks from a distance on the outskirts of Kiev,' he says. 'I totally underestimated how wary and suspicious Soviet citizens were of foreigners. A man who was walking in the area came up and stopped me. He took me to the entrance of the barracks and asked people there to call the guards. I didn‚Äôt resist. It wasn‚Äôt a situation I could run away from without causing even
[08:04:14] <quanticle> more problems.'"
[08:04:16] <quanticle> So... he might not even have been stopped by the KGB! He might have just been stopped by the local equivalent of a patriotic American noticing the suspicious-looking foreigner taking photos of a military base!
[08:04:39] <quanticle> "If you see something, say something," indeed
[08:05:07] <gwern> right? you see why I say this is *so* intensely stupid and incompetent that you have to wonder if he was sent in as a distraction, and the kgb was letting him run to try to figure out what he was a distraction from
[08:05:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> "In a 2013 interview, Makinen described his arrest, which he said stemmed from a passerby spotting him and alerting a nearby military serviceman. ‚ÄúI totally underestimated how wary and suspicious Soviet citizens were of foreigners,‚Äù he said." ... rofl
[08:05:25] <quanticle> No wonder he "finds it difficult" to talk about his experience. If I were that dumb, I'd find it difficult to talk about too.
[08:05:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> "A caption beneath the photo above claims Makinen ‚Äúhid behind bushes and attempted to take photos, but every time he lifted his camera and saw a passerby he immediately closed his camera case and lowered his camera.‚Äù" ... loooool
[08:06:10] <gwern> this is my head canon now. it's actually a high-level war between the KGB and West where they are feinting each other out by letting this idiot college student wander around, trying to see who is fooling who

[08:07:38] <gwern> if it were an anime or something, Makinen would drive out of the USSR at the end, his photos confiscated or lost, with the CIA and KGB both baffled and debating internally if they won or lost, while Mackinen smugly notes that he got a free vacation and a drinking story

[08:07:58] <gwern> "and that's how I had the coolest spring break in my class"
[08:08:30] <gwern> you'd write it as a spy comedy. mackinen would stumble around while in the background, Spy Vs Spy antics go on just out of sight
[08:08:41] <quanticle> "Makinen served his two-year term in Vladimir Prison, about 120 miles east of Moscow. [...] It was a long way from the academic environment he had known. But Makinen was allowed to borrow books from the prison library and used them to learn Russian, an achievement he calls '"an enormous psychological boost.'" He occasionally corrected grammatical mistakes when guards and administration officials
[08:08:43] <quanticle> spoke to him. The activity '"diminished their sense of authority and annoyed them,'" he says. '"After all, what could they do? Send me to punishment cell for correcting their grammatical errors?'"
[08:08:45] <quanticle> Well... if it were an American jail? Probably, yeah. He got off extremely easy, compared to what could have happend (quick trial and summary execution).
[08:09:04] <gwern> oh yeah, I'm sure there's regulations about 'disrespecting officers' or something
[08:09:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> If he were a Soviet citizen he'd get at least that, and worse
[08:09:41] <quanticle> He even got Francis Gary Powers' old cell when Powers' was exchanged back to the US. 
[08:11:59] <gwern> citizen, those microphones and cameras are not cheap!
[08:13:55] <quanticle> gwern: In your headcanon, do the Soviet win or lose by arresting Makinen?
[08:14:22] <gwern> oh, they lose. it's like punching first. it means you admit you lost control of the situation
[08:14:40] <gwern> the victory would be in understanding the purpose and somehow flipping the situation on them
[08:15:13] <gwern> arresting him would be basically saying, 'we can't figure out what he's doing or how to reverse it, so we're going to cut our losses by just ending the game here'
[08:15:38] <gwern> like arresting an agent rather than doubling them or using them to feed disinfo

[11:11:14] <quanticle> Oh. Uh... I'm not sure that even the repressed memory folks claim that. I thought that the childhood amnesia thing had to do with learning language changing the way the brain accesses memories, rendering pre-linguistic memories inaccessible.

Corrie was a member of a group of about eight activists from outside of the Palestinian territories who tried to prevent the Israeli army's activities by acting as human shields.[25]"
[11:30:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> "By situating themselves visibly between the Palestinians and the Israeli snipers manning the watchtowers they hoped to discourage shooting by displaying banners stating that they were "internationals". When Israeli soldiers fired warning shots, Corrie and her colleagues dismantled their tent and left the area.[22]" ... lol
[11:31:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Palestinian militants expressed concern that the "internationals" staying in tents between the Israeli watchtowers and the residential neighborhoods would get caught in crossfire, while other residents were concerned that the activists might be spies. To overcome this suspicion Corrie learned a few words of Arabic and participated in a mock trial denouncing the "crimes of the Bush Administration".[22] While the ISM members
[11:31:32] <Obormot\Arcturus>  were eventually provided with food and housing, a letter was circulated in Rafah that cast suspicion on them. "Who are they? Why are they here? Who asked them to come here?"[22] On the morning of Corrie's death they planned to counteract the letter's effects. According to one of them, "We all had a feeling that our role was too passive. We talked about how to engage the Israeli military."[22] "
[11:32:20] <quanticle> I mean, getting crushed by a bulldozer is sure engaging of something, namely, your flesh with the caterpillar treads of said bulldozer.

I have lost count of the number of times I‚Äôve had sex in public." ... AND YET she found herself at a sex party where it "wasn‚Äôt easy to leave for logistical reasons"
[13:19:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe - I know this is a stretch, but - *maybe* this person's problem is "tendency to make horrible decisions"

"The reason that utility functions aren't used more in games is that it is relatively more complicated to design and implement, compared to alternatives".

[23:08:32] <feep> > Anyway, the bottom line is that, if you are like most people, subscriptions will contribute to you spending more time on Youtube than you ‚Äúshould‚Äù, in the sense that your Youtube time will interfere with goals that you would, if asked, say were more important.
[23:08:43] <feep> this is uh     an odd definition of "trap"
[23:09:08] <feep> "the subscribe button makes youtube give you content you like. but this is bad actually"
[23:09:35] <feep> that is pppreeeeetty definitely not the sense that guy's uncle meant.

[23:10:48] <two2thehead> feep, hm
[23:10:54] <feep> yeah wow holy shit I saw the spreadsheet thing, fuck that guy
[23:10:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Uh, no, that's a very obvious and correct definition of "trap"
[23:10:57] <two2thehead> depends on your definition I guess
[23:11:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> And the spreadsheet thing is 100% correct too
[23:11:10] <feep> what a fucking googler hot take, fr.
[23:11:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> He's just right about every single thing he says there
[23:11:38] <feep> I fully and entirely disagree.
[23:11:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well you're wrong :p
[23:11:50] <feep> oh well then.
[23:12:18] <feep> > ‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs SO EASY to start with a spreadsheet that people are often lulled into making one, and then adding more and more to it. When your spreadsheet reaches a certain complexity level, you may then find yourself investing time into learning more and more arcane features so you can extend what it does‚Ä¶ which means that, for you, a spreadsheet will become even more the default tool the next time you want to do 
[23:12:19] <feep> something. But it‚Äôll still be a bad programming language.
[23:12:37] <feep> this is not even "stop having fun guys", it's "stop being productive wrong"
[23:12:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> No it's not
[23:12:50] <feep> really is
[23:12:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nope
[23:12:56] <two2thehead> link?
[23:13:13] <feep> honestly, spreadsheets are a better programming language for normies than actual programming languages, *by far*.

[23:13:37] <two2thehead> *clicks*
[23:13:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, which is why normies shouldn't be using them, or programming languages, or computers.
[23:13:44] <saturn2> not only is the subscribe button a trap, even the sign in button is a trap
[23:13:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> They should leave it to people who know wtf they're doing.
[23:13:52] <feep> you know what this take is

[23:14:10] <feep> "industrial society has been a disaster for the human race" lol
[23:14:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> No it's not
[23:14:15] <saturn2> actually the entire youtube ui is a trap
[23:14:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Don't be dumb feep
[23:14:42] <saturn2> thank god for yt-dlp
[23:14:57] <feep> I mean, I think the entire youtube ui is *bad*, including the subscribe button, but that's a sense in which I want "more youtube ui", not less
[23:15:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Eh, I get by fine with the youtube UI after installing those ublock filters that delete most of it
[23:15:33] <feep> and then luckily youtube added a setting to give me "no algorithm, only follow"

[23:18:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: What she doesn't say is that he needed to use Sheets because *she hired him* to do work for her, so no doubt she made him use Sheets because she's not smart enough to do things in a real programming language

[23:29:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> I decided to make it Junior's style this time, with the sponge cake base instead of a graham cracker crust. Worked out well. (Of course, it's not the actual Junior's recipe, because that has 60% more sugar than pretty much every other cheesecake recipe out there, and only half the eggs - standard practice for commercial bakeries; eggs are expensive, sugar is cheap, sweetness fools can fool people into not noticing that it's
[23:29:35] <Obormot\Arcturus>  less rich / has inferior texture due to the dearth of fat/protein from the eggs)

[23:30:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> I also used my homemade sour cream in this. Also worked out great.
