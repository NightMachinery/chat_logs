[01:39:58] <gwozniak> Welp, confirmed that my uncle's cancer is untreatable.  So he has to wait it out.  Bummer :/

[01:40:37] <dasm> gwozniak: I'm sorry to hear that.
[01:44:40] <gwozniak> Yeah, sucks
[01:45:33] <gwozniak> Likely only a few months left.  He did ask if he could smoke a lot of pot, so he appears to be at peace with it
[01:46:14] <gwozniak> Anyway, that news has been lingering for a couple of weeks now, so I'm relieved it's been confirmed
[01:46:26] <gerikson> sorry to hear that gwozniak
[01:47:57] <gwozniak> thanks, dasm, gerikson
[01:48:03] <goodger[m]> Sorry geoff :<
[01:52:11] <gwozniak> He's one of those "larger than life" people.  Apparently the nurse who was helping out with his recent colonoscopy said, "Hey, I know you. I was at one of your parties a couple years ago."
[01:52:57] <goodger[m]> did they recognise his bowel?
[01:53:53] <gwozniak> Well, it could have been his ass, based on his lifestyle
[01:55:35] <gerikson> lol
[01:56:12] <goodger[m]> I sought to imply they might have been up there in a recreational capacity

[20:26:39] <WilhelmVonWeiner> no, and I forgot the password to the filesystem and needed my server up, and couldn't send the unencrypted zfs filesystem to another machine, so i had to back up the full 3.6TB and then delete the zfs fs to reinstall grub
