[02:49:09] <creature> That's pretty neat. :) Not quite what I'm looking for here, but good to know about.
[02:50:03] <creature> I saw a similar-ish Elixir project the other day - Bureaucrat - which I haven't used. But it's pretty appealing. It basically uses your test suite to generate API documentation.
[02:50:58] *** Joins: snobbybumblebee (~snobbybum@host-176-37-164-144.b025.la.net.ua)
[02:50:58] <creature> At the end of your controller test, you pass the connection object into a method (which in Elixir, basically means you add "|> document" as the last line of your test case). And from there it can generate API docs.
[02:51:54] <creature> The connection object has URL info, HTTP method, parameters, and the response type. It's inside the test case, so there's a human readable description from the `test "it behaves this way" do` lines.

[02:54:11] <creature> And because it's generated from the test cases you're writing, it's unlikely to drift. A pretty neat-sounding tool, I thought.
[02:55:21] <iDrougge> creature: I worked before on a company where the Rails tests were used to generate documentation. I found that lacking, though, partly because of Rails's (lack of) type system, partly because there were almost no comments.

[03:51:29] <ario> how does Stripe issue yearly stocks if it's a private company?
[03:56:03] <JordiGH> Are they stocks for employees?
[03:56:23] <JordiGH> You can still issue stocks privately is my understanding. You don't have to sell them to anyone who asks if you're not public.
[03:58:53] <ngoldbaum> ario: new employees get a (tiny) ownership share, probably in the form of a class of stock that lets more senior owners dilute your shares at will
[03:59:18] <ngoldbaum> if they ever go public then the private shares get exchanged for public shares

[19:49:15] <creature> I'll check it out, but I suspect a lot of this boils down to "different situations have different needs". Which is also kinda why there's no silver bullet tool.
[19:51:50] <creature> I like the idea of generating some docs from unit tests for a few reasons. In some testing frameworks, it's really easy to do. It is, by definition, documenting behaviour that you "care about". (Like, you went to the trouble of writing a test confirming your API works a certain way! It's a use case you want to support.) It can't get out of date unless your tests are out of date.
[19:51:52] <arnt> I feel that a lot of it boils down to people not understanding what needs they have. Which are very different indeed. But if someone doesn't understand that class documentation is deeply different from the kind of API documentation stripe.com needs, they're going to be unhappy even if good tools exist for both types of tasks.
[19:52:35] <creature> And sure, you can always read the code, but not everybody will read the code. It's not either-or, you can have both. Use the test suite if it's easier; or use the HTML docs if you prefer.

But it's not a case of "Drop this tool in, and it blows through every test autogenerating stuff from what it finds." It's "If this test would also be a good documentation example, add `|> document(conn)` at the end."
[20:00:04] <arnt> What I found is (in part) that unit tests tend to be heavy on the kind of code users should use as a last resort and light on the kind of code users should try first.

[20:06:47] <creature> Yeah. I think the nub of my current problem really boils down to "You will need to use JSDoc, and that is not a good tool, but it is pretty much the only tool."
[20:09:31] <creature> (And the overall problem is "We have a big sprawling JS codebase that is hard to navigate and hard to learn, so people use it in twisted ways and/or duplicate things needlessly.")

[20:17:30] <creature> I think it's counter-productive to shit-talk JavaScript, so I try not to. But the JS ecosystem is definitely worse than Ruby, IMHO.
[20:18:40] <arnt> I like ruby. But you definitely can sprawl in it if you let yourself slide down the slope of monkey patching and unclear APIs.

[20:20:59] *** Joins: seschwar (~seschwar@user/seschwar)
[20:22:08] <creature> Like, one of the issues is that this codebase defines "classes" in the form `const MyNewClass = SomeExistingClass.extend({ ... });`. And JSDoc doesn't recognise that as a class, out of the box. You can kind of coerce it into filing it neatly into "Entities.MyNewClass" in your docs with the right combo of @annotations, I think, but it's very boilerplatey.
[20:22:42] <creature> Whereas I was hoping for something more like "You're already writing comments here; start them with `/**` instead and they'll show up nicely in our docs."
[20:24:36] <mockturtle> Marginalia Search [release web] (fkooman) https://lobste.rs/s/9mqign
[20:25:51] <arnt> One thing I found is that making the documentation tool cater to well-formed code ONLY and writing a separate hack to detect files that aren't handled by the documentation tool rocks. rewriting code to be well-formed both makes it be documented and fixes other problems with the code.
[20:26:54] *** Joins: atw (~user@154.27.197.101)
[20:28:55] <arnt> Instead of making the documentation tool handle all kinds of sucky code, detect the suckage and fix some code, randomly. Often enough you'll shake your head and say "I can't believe this ever worked."
[20:30:04] <creature> Yeah. In this case, the code is well-formed; it's a fallout of it being a dynamic language with prototypal inheritance. (And legacy code that predates ES6 syntax.)
[20:30:34] <arnt> well-formed according to the compiler, not according to jsdoc...
