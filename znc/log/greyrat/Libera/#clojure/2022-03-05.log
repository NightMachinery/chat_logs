[00:00:52] <Para> Running a Minecraft modpack used to be quite exciting. You'd basically end up with 5+ languages running in JVM in hundreds of JARs violently conflicting with each other yet not quite crashing.
[00:01:28] <seebs> https://danluu.com/julialang/ <-- i have been warned off from it. :P
[00:03:42] <tatsumaru> seebs: it's not a very mature language so it has all the problems that result from that, but I've heard it's come a long way since that old review. keep an open mind.
[00:05:40] <seebs> could be. i figure i need to focus fire a bit to learn languages well, so i picked clojure as my next language. except then i suddenly and completely spontaneously decided to read a ton of stuff about modern military tactics and politics.
[00:06:01] <tatsumaru> seebs: it all leads to the big bang eventually
[00:07:02] <tatsumaru> clojure is almost surely a better investment of time than julia for practical reasons
[00:07:28] <technomancy[m]> for math??
[00:07:46] <tatsumaru> no, for learning a new language
[00:07:56] <tatsumaru> all else being equal
[00:08:31] <technomancy[m]> I mean I have to assume someone considering Julia is considering it because they are interested in doing things Julia is good at
[00:09:46] <tatsumaru> since seebs said that he chose clojure over julia, my assumption was that he was learning a new language for learning sake, possibly just to broaden horizons
[00:10:20] <seebs> oh, yeah.
[00:10:21] <tatsumaru> like one learns sanskrit or something
[00:10:59] <seebs> i've bounced off functional programming languages several times, partially because i never needed them, partially because i keep running into people who think that the y combinator is the most daily-use-practical thing in the history of programming
[00:11:13] <technomancy> hm; yeah fair enough.
[00:11:23] <technomancy> I mean, most people aren't like that but more power to you if you are
[00:12:00] <seebs> i have a low-chance-of-getting-to-it idea involving using a couple of *very different* languages to build a "learn to program" book that attempts to get away from "yes everyone just imprints on their first language" and gets more focused on the "how do you turn a problem into a solution" part.
[00:12:30] <seebs> basically, every time i learn a language that's different from the languages i already know, i get better at *all* of them.
[00:12:41] <tatsumaru> seebs: IMO if you are learning a language to find a job, learn whatever's popular, if you are learning a language to build your own project, learn whatever's most effective, if you are learning a language to broaden your horizons - learn whatever is most exciting.
[00:12:49] <seebs> yeah, roughly.

[00:13:13] <seebs> i'm pretty happy with go for job-stuff for now, and i could do C pretty comfortably, and i'm good enough at fiddly performance crap that i can probably find work doing that.
[00:14:18] <technomancy> I dunno if you can separate "learn to build your own project" from learning to broaden your horizons
[00:14:33] <technomancy> like at some point you just have to apply it to *something* for the learning to be effective
[00:15:02] <seebs> maybe? i don't have a good idea for a project right now, but i can accept "this isn't going to be as efficient as it would be if i were writing it in something i knew better" for hobby stuff
[00:15:17] <seebs> i just need to actually pick something concrete that i feel like doing.
[00:15:51] <technomancy> I guess I mean there always has to be a project, but you can have the project driving the learning or the learning driving the project.
[00:16:02] <tatsumaru> technomancy: i think there are some people who honestly don't care about usefulness, like for example people interested in pure mathematics etc.

[00:17:44] <seebs> because they have no idea how actual use of their product works, and it's *awful* as a result
[00:17:58] <seebs> someone used the phrase "use a feature in anger" and i think that's about the right term

[00:29:24] <seebs> i tend to do best with a fair amount of high-level "here's a quick outline of a structure". i mostly build my own models, but i build them way faster if i start with a provided skeleton.
[00:30:43] <seebs> like starting out with "Clojure is a high-level dynamically typed language which relies heavily on passing functions around to get things done" would save me a ton of time compared to trying to build a model from examples.
[00:34:42] <ToxicFrog> Para: it's a language for vector graphics, but in my experience it is mostly used for spirographs, yes

[16:43:36] <Frozenlock> Yes, I always keep a single global atom.
[16:44:18] <Frozenlock> Well, except for a handful of components that exceptionally require local state which has no change of ever affecting anything else.
[16:44:58] <Frozenlock> But as a general rule a single atom is better. This way you don't need to update many atoms at once, which can become nasty.
[16:45:40] <Frozenlock> Also all your functions can be pure, and only call `swap!` after a user action like a click.
[16:47:29] <v3ga> hmm that's true. maybe i'll de-complicate things this weekend.  that's the main goal.  Now are there things that helix does better? I was reading about hiccup/reagents vectors being expensive...

[18:00:29] <seebs> > Ironically, the Monad always has at least one side-effect: it makes me feel like an idiot.
[18:01:08] <seebs> so every time i start reading about functional programming, i encounter people talking excitedly about monads, and i think that monads are the functional programming equivalent of having any symptom at all, checking WebMD, and concluding you have cancer
[18:01:44] * v3ga sits down for this...
[18:02:20] <seebs> so what IS "the monad"? it probably doesn't help that i did about 90% of the coursework for a philosophy degree once and encountered the term there first.
[18:07:21] <Para> Could be an EV company at this point.
[18:07:50] <seebs> heh

[18:08:39] <Para> Functional programming does have a fair shar of people who not understand how to talk to masses and then get all huffy when called out on it.
[18:09:29] <seebs> So apparently, one of the characters in _The Silmarilion_ is named Maitimo (later Maedhros), and no matter how often people tell me that, every time I see "Maitimo" I think "that is almost certainly another Finnish cell phone company that ended up folding in the late 90s"
[18:10:55] <Para> That could be something related to Maaemo; Earth Mother. Maemo is a mobile OS.
[18:11:40] <seebs> So, I've seen a bunch of explanations, and... it looks to me like "monad" is very close to Optional-X, and just lets you take functions which take and yield values, and replace them with functions which take an optional value, and if the value is there produce the result of the inner function on the value, and otherwise produce the optionalness, and then chain those so that you can express the chain without worrying about whether anything in it Could 
[18:11:40] <seebs> Possibly Fail.
[18:12:00] <seebs> but if it's not that I don't know what the distinction is, and if it is that, I don't understand why the descriptions are so incredibly arcane.
[18:12:01] <Para> Maiti is the Finnish word for milt; maito is milk :)
[18:12:25] <Para> And milk is also very motherly, obv. Knowing Tolkien this is probably all on purpose.
[18:12:31] <seebs> i actually know that, because of a fingerpori about someone deciding not to buy skim milk, and getting attacked by a snake.
[18:12:48] <Para> Ah, the good ol' Kyytön maito.

[18:18:38] <Para> ah, dumb me. That's "So you refuse to operate on the patient?"

[22:33:10] <seebs> so i'm told Maybe is just *an example* of monad, and you can also do the same thing for lists, and possibly for other types also, and apparently it's easy to do any *specific* version of it in most languages, but being able to treat the abstraction as its own category is theoretically interesting
[22:33:52] <seebs> i also find virtually *nothing* referring to monads that isn't haskell, so i'm wondering if this is like the thing where if you have nand gates, it's suddenly exciting and relevant that all other logic gates can be assembled from nand gates.
[22:36:12] <Solid> are you talking about programming languages?  because there are _a lot_ of mathematical papers on monads
[22:36:39] <Solid> in the former case I guess not a lot of languages have proper HKTs, which is sort of a prerequisite for talking about this particular kind of abstraction in any meaningful way
