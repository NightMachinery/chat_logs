[01:42:27] <FunkyBob> nobody knows, wallbroken ... because you haven't told anyone anything
[01:44:00] <wallbroken> well, long time ago we designed a web app using django. that app had a projectual issue because we used many2many fields to bound an item to an order
[01:44:27] <wallbroken> the right design is to have an an order in which you can insert one or many items

[02:08:50] <FunkyBob> nobody said entirely... you haven't described it _at_ _all_. Or what you need help with.

[02:13:39] <wallbroken> so i promised myself to review it when i had the time to dedicate
[02:13:43] <wallbroken> now it's time to
[02:13:47] <FunkyBob> yes, originally your design was bad because it didn't model what really needed to be recorded

[02:30:30] <FunkyBob> ivii: whic tutorial?
[02:30:51] <FunkyBob> ivii: 1. add an app. 2. inside it make a management/__init__.py and inside that a commands/__init__.py
[02:30:57] <FunkyBob> 2. write your command inside commands
[02:30:59] <FunkyBob> 3.
[02:31:01] <FunkyBob> not 2
[02:31:48] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: I think the bigest limitation of your current model is it has no concept of time
[02:32:20] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: as for the work you sunk into it... you can either keep going t he wrong direction, or recognise you've learned from it, and correct course
[02:33:14] <FunkyBob> see: https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/the-sunk-cost-fallacy
[02:34:01] <wallbroken> well, the only main improvement to my project is to separate the "order" into a dedicated model
[02:34:11] <wallbroken> but this will change the entire project implementation
[02:34:16] <wallbroken> and i'm scared about that
[02:34:29] <FunkyBob> fortunately, y our code is in git, so you can branch it and not lose what you have
[02:34:39] <FunkyBob> yes, just about everything will break
[02:34:49] <FunkyBob> but also, you can spend time learning and fixing that
[02:35:53] <wallbroken> well, i think the better approach is to do it from the scratch
[02:36:11] <wallbroken> because all of that will break with the new model
[02:41:04] <ivii> FunkyBob: Thanks, for cookiecutter it has to be like app_name/app_module/ path

[02:42:50] <FunkyBob> ivii: err... no
[02:42:55] <FunkyBob> are you confusing project with app?
[02:43:16] <FunkyBob> django uses the word 'app' peculiarly
[02:43:52] <wez> Yeah, it's more of a plugin or discrete set of features I guess
[02:45:23] <FunkyBob> oh, and "app must be linsted in INSTALLED_APPS"
[02:47:19] <FunkyBob> ivii: typically I reference all paths relative to your project namespace... that is, where startproject puts your manage.py
[02:48:47] <moldy> ivii: this is not cookiecutter, but a specific cookiecutter template
[02:49:02] <moldy> probably one which is rather opinionated

[17:30:05] <jim> GinFuyou, hope you did well in the fensing competition...
[17:31:21] <evilpyro_> Hi! I have a piece of code that just uses a ModelForm initializing it with the instance attribute. After receiving a POST and saving its creating a new database item instead of editing the one I pass...
[17:31:39] <jim> GinFuyou, that's the question though, let's assume we're "by default" so far (just running startproject mysite, then mv mysite mysite_root, then cd mysite_root and startapp polls
[17:32:28] <jim> so now, we have a dir mysite (with __init__.py) and polls (also with __init__.py)
[17:32:48] <jim> and they;re siblings, they're in the same dir
[17:33:01] <jim> so... other than those things,
[17:33:46] <jim> what's the difference between the project part mysite, and the polls app polls?
[17:34:32] <jim> is it basically the intent of how they're set up by django-admin and manage.py?
[17:35:32] <jim> I mean, I see that you shouldn't use mysite as an app, that's not what it's for, and that -is- what polls is for
[17:37:19] <gordonjcp> jim: effectively yes

[17:41:28] <jim> so they're both python packages, and the mysite one has migrations (also a python package)

[17:50:28] <GinFuyou> as I said polls would be a django app, so it has appconfig that can be added to installed apps, inabling models, migrations and few other things
[17:51:18] <GinFuyou> I guess you can roughly say that django app is a python module that has appconfig
[17:52:11] <GinFuyou> As far I as know there is no recommendation again using e.g. "mysite" as an app. Some do
[17:52:48] <GinFuyou> evilpyro_, share the code please, as asked in /topic

[18:31:17] <moldy> jim: i do recommend against it unless you really know you want it :)
[18:31:51] <moldy> the main reason being that the official docs in some places more or less assume the ``manage.py startproject`` structure where mysite is not an app
[18:32:10] <moldy> also, the order of INSTALLED_APPS matters in some situations
[18:32:25] <moldy> (template loaders, static file finders)
[18:32:25] <jim> you mean against using the project piece as an app?
[18:32:28] <moldy> jim: yes
[18:32:46] <jim> ok good enough
[18:32:54] <moldy> e.g. you can override app templates from the project using the TEMPLATES setting
[18:32:55] <jim> thanks :)
[18:33:29] <moldy> but if your project is an app, you either do not use that setting, then the order in INSTALLED_APPS becomes important
[18:33:35] *** Quits: evilpyro_ (~evilpyro@user/evilpyro) (Quit: Leaving)

[20:17:21] <aselman4> moldy: i must be missing something then because i dont undertsand the purpose of that variable. if each request will create a new thread, and each thread will have its own instance then whats the point of setting it in one thread if no other thread can see it?
[20:18:19] <moldy> aselman4: i am not familiar with the internals of the transaction-handling code, but i would guess that `in_atomic_block` keeps track of, well, whether the execution is currently in an atomic block :)
[20:18:25] <moldy> aselman4: and one thread might be while the other is not
[20:19:27] <moldy> it just doesn't seem like something you would want to share between threads?
[20:20:41] <aselman4> i thought the purpose of the atomic block was to ensure atomicity: only one at a time. or is that incorrect?
[20:21:05] <moldy> ah, yes, you misunderstood that i think

[21:47:12] <F40PH> Hello
[21:47:53] <F40PH> When I use `STATICFILES_STORAGE = "storages.backends.s3boto3.S3Boto3Storage"`, it loads my assets from S3 as expected
[21:48:05] <F40PH> I'm trying to implement cache busting now
[21:48:17] <F40PH> From what I gather, I can use the following: STATICFILES_STORAGE = "storages.backends.s3boto3.S3ManifestStaticStorage"
[21:48:33] <F40PH> But this results in an error 500 :/
[21:48:41] <F40PH> Anyone know what I could be doing wrong?
[21:49:21] <F40PH> Or how I can find the cause of the 500 error. Because if I set DEBUG to True again, S3ManifestStaticStorage is no longer relevant, and doesn't cause the 500
