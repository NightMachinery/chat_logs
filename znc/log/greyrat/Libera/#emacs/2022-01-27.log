[00:04:13] <GoodCodeGuy> I have to say, and then I'll can it to let other discussions take place. I've been programming for abotu 10y and used vscode, vim, neovim, and finally bit the bullet on emacs. The learning curve was brutal and yesterday it finally made sense. A well configured emacs lets you operate nearly at the speed of thought. Talk about HCI. I was reeling last night. Anyway, hope to be helpful sometimes. That is all for now

[00:07:19] <GoodCodeGuy> Lisp is pretty cool. That's the other brutal part of emacs learning curve. You have to get acquianted with lisp to even use it well!

[00:08:14] <artefact> here's your one liner: emacs. emacs lisp.
[00:08:16] <nij-> I think that's the main reason why lisp remains less popular, which is fine.

[00:08:48] <nij-> thuna`: PCL is very great. I come back to it every now and then.
[00:08:57] <artefact> "imagine erlang, or caml, but with annoying parentheses everywhere"
[00:09:14] <pkal> yeah
[00:09:27] <corwin> When people appear shell-shocked at the idea of elisp I often mention that lisp is one of the oldest programming languages still in use.  it predates ability to effencient process BNF grammers, meaning: easy for the computer to parse, which translates to "easy for the human to write/parse", once we get past the "this looks odd" factor.

[00:15:36] <thuna`> A badly indented lisp code is still impossible to navigate, though
[00:15:38] <GoodCodeGuy> when you say paren match, you mean automatically close parens for you or highlight missing?
[00:15:58] <thuna`> GoodCodeGuy: show-paren-mode probably
[00:16:05] <rpav> thuna`: yeah and sadly finding options for "push button format code" for lisp isn't easy
[00:16:10] <GoodCodeGuy> reply thuna / badly formatted or badly organized code is hard to navigate in any language I feel like
[00:16:36] <rpav> GoodCodeGuy: i mean the matching paren is hilighted, or the cursor jumps there, or whatever
[00:16:59] <rpav> or a mismatch is hilighted differently and so on
[00:17:15] <rpav> lisp is also nice in that there's paredit
[00:17:23] <GoodCodeGuy> vscode has some great extensions for that and great autoformatters. I feel quite accomplished in that I just got emacs working with go and delve debugger. It was humbling
[00:17:41] <GoodCodeGuy> but I think I'll stick around emacs for awhile ;)

[00:19:55] <GoodCodeGuy> the values of emacs one makes a compelling case for how vscode is quite good and edging onto the far territorial borders of emacs
[00:20:01] <zebrag> nij-: https://bpa.st/B56Q so it has the same kill-new. How can that relate to the kill ring not working from outside "after" the successful operation org-protocol-store-link? and having to do some `C-c` before it works again

[00:23:07] <GoodCodeGuy> nij- I don't think it is better per se. But it does an amazing thing in that it works right out of the box with almost any stack.

[00:24:02] <GoodCodeGuy> and kids these days (I'm still young I guess) grew up with guis and handholding. so coming into emacs and lisp fresh can be a brutal experience (it was the first few times I tried)
[00:24:15] <nij-> DOn't worry it won't break - you can always restart emacs or define it back to its original def.
[00:24:56] <nij-> GoodCodeGuy: I got ya. Yeah, I'm a doom user and I also can't imagine moving away from it.
[00:25:06] <jeetelongname> GoodCodeGuy: I was pondering myself why I use emacs over vscode, I came to the conclusion that extending an editor through some structured API is not as easy or as fun as being attached to a live lisp VM and editing that on the fly. add to that a killer almost precognisant help system and a great DSL (javascript is a fine language but I will kashoot myself before I use it as a config language) it makes the point moot
[00:25:27] <nij-> I tried, and found no point doing that. It has too many things I like bound for me. If I want to start vanilla, I will have to create a large and ugly config.

[00:27:52] <grym> TIL this little gem: Object.fromEntries([[1,2], [3,4,5], [10], []])  evaluates to {1: 2, 3: 4, 10: undefined, undefined: undefined}
[00:28:21] <rpav> this isnt' about language; i like JS, i like lisp, etc .. it's just vscode is an idiotically enterprisey process to extend, and emacs is "type in some code"
[00:28:31] <jeetelongname> I guess its all about perspective, to the average web dev they probably feel at home, but for a lot of other people its painful and not needed
[00:28:39] <nij-> rpav: in short they cut the programmers limbs, grounded them from running, and proved to provide a "safer environment"

[00:29:31] <GoodCodeGuy> but is that necessarily a bad thing? many many many more programmers can be fed into the mix. and (at least from my perspective) there seems to be a "rediscovery" of emacs, lisp, neovim and other such things that get away from the boxed ide

[00:31:41] <jeetelongname> It depends on usecase, someone learning ill probably tell them to use vscode as the learning curve of using emacs *while* also learning to program would be rough enough to turn them away, if someone wants an ide that works vscode or any other "boxed" ide is probably better than emacs, for people who want to tinker emacs is best

[00:46:53] <technomancy> nij-: macros are hyped up as this kind of mystical experience but the legitimate use cases for them are relatively rare; meanwhile using a lisp means that you get homoiconic syntax, which means you get to throw away an enormous amount of bullshit like early returns, operator precedence, breaking in loops, etc
[00:47:40] <GoodCodeGuy> jeetelongname that's a good article. Currently reading, thanks for share
[00:48:02] <jeetelongname> I mean i did not happen in one sitting, only once I got familier with lisp did I start seeing its benifits, "time" in this sense is just using the langauge for a short amount of time

[00:49:22] <technomancy> macros give you early return, which sucks
[00:49:42] <nij-> it depends on how you write the macros.

[00:50:00] <nij-> thuna`: same arguments work for other langs too
[00:50:20] <nij-> technomancy: With lisp macro we can easily do syntax abstractions.
[00:50:27] <technomancy> nij-: exactly my point; you have to trust macro authors to have sense
[00:50:35] <nij-> In principle, we don't need that.
[00:50:46] <technomancy> this means you get stuff like early returns and CL LOOP
[00:50:58] <ski> early returns, breaks, (and the cut in Prolog) are all examples of "syntactic dynamical scope", which hinders refactoring (factoring/folding out code, inlining back)

[00:59:18] <technomancy> you need something like this: (funcall (if (< 1 0) '+ '*) 42 100)

[00:59:40] <ski>   (funcall (if (< 1 0) #'+ #'*) 42 100)  ; in a Lisp-2 you'd need to convert the function/procedure names to values, and then use `funcall' to call a function value
[00:59:41] <technomancy> basically instead of calling the function directly you pass it to funcall to call the function, and instead of passing the function, you pass a symbol that names the function
[00:59:59] <technomancy> GoodCodeGuy: because of this I think elisp is actually kind of a shit first lisp to learn; it's way more complex than it needs to be
[01:00:17] <GoodCodeGuy> that's good to know ^

[01:23:01] <GoodCodeGuy> I mean that article makes an argument for expressibility. The python might be uglier, but it is very expressive and, this isn't small, familiar due to its follwowing of spoken language.
[01:23:23] <rpav> python is absolutely not expressive
[01:23:24] <technomancy> similarity to spoken language is a really dangerous path to go down

[01:25:34] <rpav> i'm not sure what the implication is, i guess
[01:25:43] <grym> the implication is that it's all synatx
[01:25:44] <GoodCodeGuy> I disagree about more popular necessarily being more stupid. It depends what you mean with those words (language ambiguity!). More popular implies more people which implies more stupid but also more intelligence. You'd have to make an argument for better stupid:intelligent ratios xD
[01:26:02] <rpav> like, it matters .. something that understands natural language has ot be able to ask for clarification; do they acknowledge this and say "yeah so we'll do that" or "we don't care we'll just assume"
[01:26:03] <ski> of course you can say  (if (< x y) (+ x y) (* x y))  too .. what matters is the ability to refactor inbetween different forms, emphasizing/highlighting different features, or expressing it in differing ways
[01:26:15] <grym> there are some NLP cultists who have decided that because all they do is syntax statistics, then syntax statistics are all that is, but i think they're completely batty

[01:27:32] <grym> speech to text isn't even NLP
[01:27:41] <ski> a programming language is not only classified by expressiveness (aka "cavalier power"), but also by "reasonability" (aka "predictive power"), the ease with which you can reason about, and refactor code

[02:09:47] <thuna`> The documentation states that it should work when called in the form "U/T" or (:url "U" :title "T") if I am reading it correctly
[02:09:47] <zebrag> it seems to only accept old style
[02:10:04] <thuna`> Yes, it does seem to only accept old style

[02:12:09] <zebrag> And: it does accept new style fron terminal xdg-open
[02:12:20] <thuna`> Try replacing the splitparts part of let with this: https://0x0.st/oHsS.txt

[02:14:12] <zebrag> if you replace nil by t it works

[02:14:54] <zebrag> some say that it's all the fun of it
[02:14:59] <thuna`> Well if you replace it with listp it works with new-style
[02:15:40] <zebrag> you mean this line? https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/19dcb237b5b02b36580294ab309124f346a66024/lisp/org/org-protocol.el#L467

[02:15:53] <thuna`> yup
[02:16:41] <zebrag> thuna`: if you replace it with anything but nil it works, because it's true (lisp's true)
[02:17:23] <thuna`> No, I mean if you replace it with (listp fname) it works when fname is new-style /and/ when its in old "U/T" style

[02:19:23] <zebrag> I don't know
[02:19:47] <thuna`> Maybe somewhere along the line "url=U&title=T" is converted to '(:url "U" :title "T")?
[02:19:58] <thuna`> In fact, that seems like what is happening here

[14:27:23] <Unicorn_Princess> I'm trying to fix https://github.com/emacsorphanage/yascroll/blob/master/yascroll.el currently the scroll-bar disappears if the window reaches past the end of a buffer (e.g. if you vertically center on the last line). i thought i could fix it easily by clamping scroll-top (line 275) to a range where the window bottom doesn't reach past the end. but it still behaves weird (scroll bar goes to the middle when centering on last
[14:27:23] <Unicorn_Princess> line, and becomes very small, then slowly moves down as you scroll up, eventually starts widening, and finally reaches the correct appearance when window is no longer showing any past-the-end lines)
[14:28:36] <Unicorn_Princess> now it doesn't help that i can't lisp, but i've been squinting at that function and the behavior suggests it's getting display state data from other places as well, but i can't figure out where

[15:31:35] <Unicorn_Princess> even on a 1TB log it's a useful display of location
[15:31:52] <twb> Unicorn_Princess: no it's not because you cannot find all the newlines in a reasonable time

[16:50:29] <twb> feels like a solo project
[16:50:49] <empwilli> MiPMrnP`: mu4e is a great start; if you're used to sth. like mutt it's great
[16:50:55] <artefact> mu4e, coming from mutt, was straightforward
[16:51:09] <twb> Personally I use mutt+emacs for direct mail and gnus for mailing lists
[16:51:23] <artefact> only issues so far is that my .mu database gets trashed sometimes, and i have to recreate it from scratch, and i have yet to figure out pgp auto clearsign
[16:51:23] <thomasb06> Linux started as a janky project, hehe
[16:51:34] <MiPMrnP`> Extremely ignorant question. What do you use a newsreader for?
[16:51:35] <twb> linux started as a troll of andy
[16:51:39] <twb> MiPMrnP`: reading news
[16:51:40] <artefact> for reading news
[16:51:59] <bkhl> MiPMrnP`, to read up the news to viewers of your news television program.
[16:52:14] <twb> MiPMrnP`: news is basically a more organized kind of mailing lists
[16:53:09] <twb> i.e. gnus is good at "I get 50,000 emails every day and I only REALLY care about 100 of them"
[16:53:37] <MiPMrnP`> Okay now I see. You check out a lot of mailing lists and then sieve them for what you are interested in?
[16:53:40] <twb> It's less good at like "find all emails tagged 'mum' and 'nip-slip'"
[16:53:57] <twb> MiPMrnP`: more like you're on LKML
[16:54:05] <empwilli> I think this is not as straight forward when you're used to get news delivered to you by social media. I found myself constantly polling n+1 websites for new updates, moving this to a news reader helped me a lot.
[16:54:40] <twb> yeah if you have "RSS feeds" that is probably the modern equivalent, except you can reply

[20:36:08] <judybot> artefact: smalltalk: it has a clean, range bound notation (no parens) to select functions and variables. It also provides symbolic, but unambiguous completion with ?, : and (for an operator), as well as use of symbols with arbitrary intensions (

[20:39:03] <rpav> GoodCodeGuy: i mean for a good CL "dev environment," you're going to want SBCL, Slime or Sly, and a fair bit of emacs customization, and to make it all work on your platform of choice
[20:39:25] <rpav> it's not hard per se, but it is a bunch of steps to "works nicely"
[20:39:49] <rpav> with elisp, probably the main thing is making tab tab-complete, which is pretty easy
[20:40:21] <GoodCodeGuy> I had no idea regarding the games. rpav: as for setups that isn't too bad. It sounds like you're saying "start with elisp, once you get comfy go to cl"?
[20:40:43] <rpav> GoodCodeGuy: yeah .. i mean if you just want to dive in and try a few things from a book
[20:40:59] <rpav> maybe after a day or so hop into CL if you want/need more

[20:42:49] <bremner> well, from my point of view all of CL is pretty ancient
[20:43:02] <rpav> bah, CL is mid-90s, as lisp goes that's pretty new
[20:43:03] <GoodCodeGuy> I think I have a working model for elisp juust from customizing emacs and recustomizing it and recustomizing it and ...

[20:45:59] <fsbot``> Lisp: [0/5] one of the oldest programming languages, originating in the late 1950s. It's constantly evolving, with the current dialects being Common Lisp and Scheme. Though Emacs Lisp is younger than both Scheme and Common lisp, it is based on an older Lisp. Emacs brings with it a great library for text manipulation and inter-process communication, which provides a great programming environment. ;;[ ,more / ,dump]

[22:06:44] <technomancy> conceptually I really like the idea of the same command being able to operate on a character, a word, a sentence, an expression, etc
[22:06:50] <technomancy> but my fingers can't vim

[22:08:17] <technomancy> like ... it should be just forward, and it should take an argument
[22:08:27] <rpav> maybe
[22:08:33] <ldb> what I learned from TECO is don't hesitate to write proper programs for text editing tasks, rather than trying to do that with one keystrokes
[22:08:35] <technomancy> the whole point of emacs is that every keystroke is a function call
[22:08:37] <technomancy> functions take argumetns
[22:08:39] <rpav> i mean, emacs's api is terrible no doubt

[23:22:59] <blaub> vertico is a replacement for ivy?
[23:23:09] <blaub> it is "yet another emacs completion framework"
[23:23:12] <pkal> blaub: Really?  Most packages don't explicitly depend on Ivy (at least the ones I know), but use the generic completion read
[23:23:29] <blaub> pkal: could be only me and my feelings
[23:23:43] <pkal> I guess it depends on the packages you use
[23:24:47] <pkal> blaub: It is a reimplementation of the same concept (vertical completion), without reimplementing as much as Ivy does.  AFAIK the core of vertico is just a temporary advice function it applies to a few completion primitives.
[23:26:25] <pkal> What makes it interesting is that it provides a number of extensions that you can use the change the defaults.  They can even be combined depending on what command is being used.  Eg. in my case I have been using the "flat" (horizontal) mode by default, but certain commands are displayed in seperate buffers (instead of the minibuffer), where vertical completion makes sense.

[23:35:52] <blaub> pkal: are you an "emacs only" guy as in, do you use any other editor, IDE, etc. ?
[23:37:08] <pkal> blaub: I use vi during brief terminal sessions, but mainly Emacs.  Why?

[23:37:59] <blaub> pkal: always wanted to dive into it more but when you've all those other editors, ides on the job, it is not that easy

[23:38:42] <blaub> somehow i've to use phpstorm, intellij, vscode to get the job done, but i'm questioning myself if it wouldn't be better to get that last bit into emacs and get more out of it in the long term
[23:38:45] <pkal> It certainly is a kind of unusual hobby.
[23:39:17] <blaub> it just feels so powerful to have something that already existed for so long

[23:39:38] <pkal> blaub: If it gets the job done, then intellij/vscode is fine, my issue is that I am so used to Emacs that these "regular" editors hinder me from working without getting very irritated.
[23:40:05] <blaub> sometimes i ask myself why I'm such a weirdo using emacs, when there are other, more modern tools.
[23:40:40] <blaub> pkal: so do you use treemacs, lsp, tabs? would like to see more of your setup! :)

[23:42:24] <pkal> blaub: no, no-ish (eglot), no.  I think to myself if people could use traditional Emacs productivly 30 years ago, then it should be possible to do so now too.
[23:42:58] <pkal> I am kind of suprised to see interest in the way I use Emacs, because for the most part it is pretty boring.

[23:51:50] <grym> i've mentioned this a few times i think, but my advisor is someone who has used emacs since the 80s and as far as i know has never customized it in particular
[23:52:04] <thuna`> grym: how
[23:52:14] <grym> thuna`: well, he types "emacs"
[23:52:18] <grym> and then does stuff
[23:52:25] <grym> and then opens a terminal and types `tex ...`
[23:52:40] <Catie> They should study this guy in a lab
[23:52:57] <grym> ha ha joke's on you: he studies people in a lab!
[23:53:20] <thuna`> What about the theme?
[23:53:36] <grym> my explanation is that he has so thoroughly been nerd-sniped by signals processing that there's no room for more sniping
[23:53:40] <grym> thuna`: bone stock
[23:54:06] <thuna`> Thats... something else
[23:54:33] <Catie> I can absolutely respect it
[23:55:16] <thuna`> I could definately use a little bit of what he has in my daily life
[23:55:24] <pkal> grym: Most professors I know who use Emacs are like that it seems.
