[16:05:45] <ManofLetters[m]> kayvankand me
[16:06:06] <ManofLetters[m]> we threatened we'd make this room into a LambdaHack ASCII rogulike den, but we reconsidered and took pity
[16:09:59] <f-a> I would like #lh dev discuss
[16:15:11] <ManofLetters[m]> Kayvan Kazeminejad: so perhaps we can move some higher level design talks here, once we have them
[16:15:30] <ManofLetters[m]> or some discussions about Haskell things in relation to LH
[16:15:48] <ManofLetters[m]> that might be interesting to the general population of Haskell gamedevs
[16:16:04] <f-a> ot but this people are making bank with an ascii game https://store.steampowered.com/app/659540/Warsim_The_Realm_of_Aslona/ means there is a market out there
[16:16:47] <ManofLetters[m]> do you have any stats on them?
[16:21:12] <f-a> frankly no I donâ€™t use steam either but lotsa reviews and it is one of those games with long tails
[16:21:20] <f-a> (i.e. not an adventure game)
[16:22:50] <ManofLetters[m]> +1
