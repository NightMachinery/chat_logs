[01:15:46] <rektide> i want to run thid program, and output it to screen, but i also want to check to see if it outputs a certain string. i feel like i'm probably missing some better strategies?

[01:15:54] <machabot> rektide: hello world
[01:15:54] <machabot> rektide: 0
[01:16:11] <Mikachu> where does third come into the picture
[01:16:56] <rektide> oh sorry, bad editing. s/thid/some/
[01:17:38] <phy1729> You can tee to /dev/tty
[01:17:41] <Mikachu> why aren't we just doing echo hello world | grep world
[01:18:08] <Mikachu> ah, you want to output all lines, but check if any matched
[01:18:11] <rektide> it's not a great examp... yeah
[01:18:24] <Mikachu> and when it finishes, return status should reflect if it matched

[01:23:02] <phy1729> Doesn't compose nicely though
[01:23:21] <Mikachu> stdout doesn't necessarily start out being pointed to the terminal...
[01:23:33] <Mikachu> although they did say "to screen" so i guess you win this round
[01:23:40] <rektide> oooh good point
[01:24:28] <rektide> i thought redirect >&3 would mean that grep would run & try to read stdout from the previous & find nothing, so i don't understand why/how this works
[01:24:32] <Mikachu> if it's a script and someone runs >& /dev/null they probably don't want to see random hello worlds pop up
[01:24:33] <phy1729> Mikachu: I think you won the point
[01:25:03] <Mikachu> rektide: >&3 means redirect stdout (of the print command) to fd 3, which has previously been redirected to stdout (the terminal or whatever) in the surrounding context
[01:25:39] <Mikachu> and because we do both > and a pipe, zsh copies the output for us (this is the infamous multios feature)
[01:27:03] <Mikachu> if you're doing this a lot in the script, you can probably do something like exec {stdout}>&1 at top of the script
[01:27:11] <Mikachu> then you can just print foo bar >&$stdout | grep -q whatever
[01:27:12] <Mikachu> i think
[01:27:35] <Mikachu> note that "stdout" here is an arbitrary name
[01:27:46] <Mikachu> in case it looks magical :)

[15:16:35] <ratijas> > Sometimes when switching back (focusing) to a Konsole window, all of a sudden it gets flooded / filled with same characters as if they were typed in / pasted.
[15:16:36] <Han> How can I make this code continue?
[15:16:40] <machabot> ratijas: /dev/stdin:1: invalid mode specification
[15:17:32] <ratijas> In other words, the window is flooded with the same character as if it was pressed and held for some time, or typed in repeatedly many times. It seems that amount of characters "pasted" vs. time is a linear dependency

[22:40:52] <glik22> i'm updating my $PATH in .zshenv, but when i echo in inside of .zprofile it has more paths in front of it which i did not add
[22:41:25] <phy1729> Could have been added by the system zprofile

[22:47:30] <glik22> phy1729: where is that located?
[22:48:26] <phy1729> /etc/zprofile or /etc/zsh/zprofile usually (it's set at compile time iirc)
[22:49:28] <glik22> hm that file is there but it doesn't set any path stuff
[22:50:19] <glik22> it looks like whatever is in /etc/paths is appended to the beginning of $PATH in between sourcing .zshenv and .zprofile
[22:50:52] <phy1729> zsh -xic exit |& grep -i path
[22:51:38] <glik22> and acutally i'm wrong, /etc/zprofile calls /usr/libexec/path_helper

[22:53:51] <Mikachu> It's surprisingly easy to navigate in the code base, even without entirely
[22:53:51] <Mikachu> understanding C syntax. So good job keeping it organized!
[22:54:01] <Mikachu> this is maybe the least expected comment i ever thought i'd read about the zsh code
[22:54:04] <phy1729> I was suprised too
[22:54:18] <Mikachu> maybe not knowing C shields them from how horrible it actually is
