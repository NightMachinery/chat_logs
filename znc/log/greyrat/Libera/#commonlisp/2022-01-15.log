[03:13:43] <jmes> When I use the executable of my program (built with asdf:make & sbcl), my (format t "...") output only gets displayed in a terminal after I exit the program. In SLIME it's fine. I'm pretty clueless so any ideas would be appreciated.
[03:15:54] <jmes> for example I have a prompt like (format t "Enter something:") and then a read-line. Even though I can enter something to be read and everything else works as intended I won't see the prompt text until I SIGINT the program

[07:09:14] <Josh_2> I am getting odd behaviour with a macro
[07:10:41] <Josh_2> Ofcourse now I cannot replicate it :facepalm:
[07:10:44] <pillton> Bike: I was referring to operations involving AREF like (dotimes (i (length array)) (incf (aref array i))) where there is nothing you can do to hint that the index given to AREF and (SETF AREF) is always valid for ARRAY (well, something more sensible than (declare (optimize (speed 3) (safety 0)))). A "sufficiently smart" compiler could possibly derive that example, but what about more operations for more complex data structures e.g. a
[07:10:45] <pillton> heap? One could argue that the cost of the index check is negligble compared to some of the heap operations and thus not worth exploring.
[07:10:45] <Colleen> pillton: Bike said 13 hours, 36 minutes ago: "I think there should be another operator or operators introduced which either avoid using AREF or ensure that every call to AREF does not require checking its arguments." what do you mean?
[07:11:39] <pillton> Bike: Perhaps a better example is (dotimes (i (length array2)) (incf (aref array1 (aref array2 i)))).
[07:12:27] <Josh_2> Well idk, seems to be working now
[07:13:05] <Bike> pillton: ahh. i understand. that gets tricky if you contemplate concurrency though
[07:13:14] <Bike> clearly we just need to extend the language with dependent types
[07:13:48] <pillton> Bike: I get the concurrency argument, but I think there is something more fundamental that needs to be addressed.
[07:15:51] <pillton> Maybe the problem goes away if you define operations which operate on "blocks" with a fixed length i.e. simd operations?

[07:48:03] <Spawns> lisp macros can call any functions eval'd before the macro definition yeah? how does that work?
[07:48:12] <pillton> Bike: Ok. Right.
[07:48:53] <Spawns> i am at the point where the next thing i need to implement in my lisp is macros, but I'm not sure how to deal with generating bytecode and expanding macros that depend on programs, which are bytecode
[07:49:43] <Spawns> i am thinking to compile and interpreter a single expression at a time, and the compiler is going to have to be able to pass in data to be expanded while compiling
[07:50:06] <pillton> Bike: It sounds complicated.
[07:50:14] <pillton> looks*
[07:50:29] <Bike> Spawns: generally, the lisp compiler has access to a lisp interpreter or other way to evaluate lisp code. it then just calls the macro function on the code.
[07:50:41] <Bike> pillton: it is. makes your type system uncomputable and stuff. but lisp's already is, so hey
[07:51:03] <Bike> and i think it's fairly easy in particular cases, like this array thing
[07:51:24] <Bike> "this array is x long, so if (0 <= y < x), (aref array y) doesn't have to bounds check"
[07:51:32] <moon-child> Bike: why would you need an interpreter?  Aside maybe from bootstrapping, I see no reason why you could not compile the macro body
[07:51:49] <Bike> moon-child: "or other way"
[07:52:30] <moon-child> sure.  But given you have a compiler anyway, it seems strange not to use it
[07:53:14] <Bike> i didn't mean to say you couldn't use it. i am trying to explain this to someone who is perhaps not familiar with the internals of lisp implementations.
[07:54:14] <Spawns> that makes sense Bike !

A macro is expanded by a call to the macro function which is given an S-expression (and an environment in Common Lisp), and which returns another S-expression.

[08:13:36] <beach> No, calling a macro function would involve the exact same work then.
[08:13:53] <beach> Some other part of the system may be simplified, but not that one.
[08:20:30] <beach> Spawns: It is very hard to help you with this thing, because you are implementing a language for which we have no specification.  So we have no way of knowing what kind of restrictions or generalizations your language has compared to Common Lisp.  The best thing we can do is to let you know how things would be done in a typical Common Lisp implementation.
[08:21:39] <Spawns> thats actually very helpful beach
[08:21:59] <Spawns> i have so far been following the scheme spec fairly loosely
[08:22:14] <Bike> scheme macros are pretty different from common lisp ones.
[08:22:19] <moon-child> _the_ scheme spec? :)
[08:22:24] <Spawns> but i think hygienic macros will be too difficult for me to implement
[08:22:29] <beach> moon-child: Heh!
[08:22:41] <Spawns> the most recent version r7rs
[08:22:48] <Spawns> the "small" subset
[08:22:50] <moon-child> _the_ r7rs? :)
[08:22:55] <beach> Spawns: So with that in mind, in Common Lisp, a macro function is just an ordinary function that takes two arguments, a form and an environment object.  The function builds a new form and returns it.  It doesn't matter, then, whether the macro function is coded in assembly or something else.
[08:23:14] <Spawns> that makes a lot of sense!
[08:23:30] <Spawns> for some reason I was thinking it was going to be a lot more difficult
[08:24:25] <Spawns> once I have macros implemented and working I will have an actually capable lisp!
[08:25:04] <Spawns> the amount of work that goes into making a cl implementation must be intense

[08:53:21] <moon-child> could use EQ if you guarantee structure-sharing ahead-of-time.  Or use a hash table if you have a bunch of elements to remove
[08:53:55] <asarch> Then I could have  '((:id 1 :name "taco") (:id 2 :name "pizza") (:id 3 :name "beer")) and then a list of ids '(1 2)

[09:22:29] <Spawns> is it possible to have my interpreter's implementation of conses as an immutable data structure but provide a mutable api to the lisp itself? do any cl implementations do something like that?
[09:23:22] <Spawns> i am sort of confused how you could implement that, since lists don't store pointers going backwards
[09:24:39] <Spawns> appending and pushing is easy, but doing set-car or whatever to an element in the middle is tricky
[09:27:13] <beach> Spawns: I have no idea what that means.  Mutability doesn't seem to have anything to do with back pointers.
[09:28:05] <Spawns> how can you create a new list when doing "set-car" in the middle of a list, if you can't copy the list from front to back with just that part of it changed
[09:28:13] <beach> And I don't see the difficulty of doing a RPLACA "in the middle" whatever that might mean.
[09:28:28] <beach> Spawns: Common Lisp doesn't have an operator named SET-CAR.
[09:29:15] <beach> Also, Common Lisp does not have immutable lists.
[09:29:18] <Spawns> like with appending, you just make a brand new list with an extra element tacked on the end, pushing you do the same but with the front. setting a car however, just gives you a single cons cell from the list, so you don't know how to return an entirely new list with just that part changed
[09:29:59] <Spawns> immutable in the sense of python strings being immutable
[09:30:00] <beach> Right, RPLACA is an operator that mutates the CONS cell.
[09:30:30] <Spawns> that requires the underlying repr to be mutable i guess
[09:30:37] <Spawns> i don't think there is an easy way around it
[09:31:18] <Spawns> can't you do like (setf (cddr list) nil)
[09:31:31] <beach> Sure you can.
[09:31:44] <moon-child> Spawns: obviously, immutable languages are turing-complete, so you _can_ implement a mutable language in terms of immutable semantics
[09:31:50] <beach> But that's an unrelated question.
[09:31:57] <moon-child> however, it will be very difficult to implement, and perform poorly
[09:32:19] <Spawns> beach: setf only knows about the specific cons cell that cddr returns
[09:32:20] <moon-child> beach: 'Common Lisp does not have immutable lists'  literals? scnr
[09:32:58] <moon-child> Spawns: setf is a macro.  In the case of CDDR, that will expand to something like (rplacd (cdr list) nil)
[09:33:01] <beach> I would appreciate not being corrected when I attempt a pedagogical approximation to a newbie.
[09:33:23] <Spawns> i think you are right about performance moon-child, that will be a lot of allocations and general churn
[09:34:16] <Spawns> the main reason I am asking is because doing mutable link lists in rust is a massive annoyance
[09:34:21] <beach> Spawns:  More generally, this is a channel for Common Lisp.  You are attempting the implementation of a different language for which we have no specification, so it is nearly impossible to give you advice.

[09:35:45] <minion> Spawns: SICL: SICL is a (perhaps futile) attempt to re-implement Common Lisp from scratch, hopefully using improved programming and bootstrapping techniques. See https://github.com/robert-strandh/SICL
[09:36:36] <Spawns> how does bootstrapping that work beach ?
[09:36:40] <beach> Spawns: Usually, a CONS cell consists of two consecutive words in memory, and a list is just a sequence of CONS cells, linked by their CDR.
[09:37:16] <beach> Spawns: SICL bootstrapping?  The compiler is written in Common Lisp and generates native code.  Or will, when we are done.
[09:37:40] <Spawns> oh yeah that makes sense, very cool
[09:37:57] <beach> It's pretty standard practice to implement a language in itself.
[09:38:33] <beach> Spawns: You might want to read the paper by Krystof, entitled "SBCL, a Sanely Bootstrappable Common Lisp".  SBCL is mostly written in Common Lisp as well.
[09:38:53] <Spawns> I did not realize that about SBCL, that's very interesting
[09:39:08] <Spawns> sure i'll look for it if its online
[09:39:55] <beach> Spawns: You might also watch my videos for the online Lisp meeting, entitled "Creating a Common Lisp implementation".
[09:40:34] <Spawns> is that from a channel "Online Lisp Meetings"?
[09:40:49] <beach> I think that's what I said, yes.

[10:51:07] <ns12> Hello, in "EVAL-WHEN considered harmful to your mental health" (https://fare.livejournal.com/146698.html), I see "The Lisp processor reads a stream of text (an unfortunate choice of specification, INTERLISP and Smalltalk fans may tell you) ...".
[10:51:37] <ns12> What is the meaning of that? What do Interlisp and Smalltalk have?
[10:56:50] *** Joins: Oddity (~Oddity@user/oddity)
[10:57:51] <beach> ns12: I am just guessing, but I think it means that Common Lisp is based on keeping source code in files, and those other systems are more "image based".
[10:58:24] <ns12> That makes sense. Thank you.
[10:58:37] <beach> Sure.

[12:05:10] <pjb> ns12: it's just the matter of developping a few tools, including a nice editor. there's CL:ED but most implementations defer to an external program or don't implement it.
[12:08:14] <phoe> and there's the problem where images accumulate cruft over time - and Smalltalk and Interlisp images are no exception
[12:09:53] <moon-child> ource code accumulates cruft over time too :)
[12:10:37] <phoe> sure, but textual source code is inspectable easier than images which are composed of many things that are impossible to show as text
[12:11:03] <phoe> while text as a representation of source code has many downsides, this one is a clear upside
[12:12:04] <moon-child> I may ask my image (or, at least, ought to be able to ask my image) not only 'show me all the objects', but also 'show me all the relationships between the objects'
[12:12:15] <akater[m]> I've seen a tool that converts textual image diffs into visual image diffs
[12:12:39] <moon-child> which would seem to make it much more amenable to introspection
[12:13:13] <akater[m]> oh it's about Lisp image?  sorry
[12:17:20] <akater[m]> How expensive would it be to keep a registry of all objects, or at least of objects of all interesting classes to make cruft more manageable?  (Maybe commercial Lisps do this already, I don't know)

[16:09:20] <beach> rotateq: You need to make sure you know the definition before attempting to help.
[16:09:30] <cage> a symbol is a string designator and 'nil' is a symbol
[16:09:43] <beach> Right, and then it designates what?

[21:27:20] <sveit_> if i'm using symbols as flags inside of a function, is there a reason to prefer keyword, uninterned, or "normal" symbols?
[21:27:43] <White_Flame> depends on how broadly they're passed around
[21:28:22] <White_Flame> also, even if they're purely internally used within your function, keywords can higlight in your source code and have a good visual distinction from your local var names
[21:28:24] <sveit_> say that they are meant to be used exactly in the scope of the function body (otherwise I guess uninterned would not work)

[21:30:16] <sveit_> whoops, should be (eql size 'big')
[21:30:26] <White_Flame> 'big
[21:30:35] <White_Flame> but yeah, it really doesn't matter
[21:30:42] <White_Flame> just stylistically
[21:31:21] <White_Flame> for simple cases like that, local vars used as flags can be simpler & faster
[21:31:34] <White_Flame> but I could sort of see if you have a ton of potential symbols that you're using to organize it
[21:36:29] <sveit_> in reality, i have a slightly more non-trivial usecase: i have a relatively small (5) number of numbers in some numerical algorithm, a b c d e, and want to know their relative ordering to decide on the order other parts of the algorithm will run. the most reasonable thing seemed to be to do something like (sort (list (cons 'a a) (cons 'b b) ...) #'< :key #'cdr), which inspired this question
[21:37:15] <sveit_> i could write some forest of conditionals, but this seemed like a more reasonable approach. if you have a better solution actually i'd really like to see it

[23:38:11] <Bike> phoe: correct. compile cannot make closures (except, you know, internally)
[23:38:14] <_death> phoe: correct.. I wonder why it's not implementation defined
[23:38:22] <phoe> _death: Bike: OK - understood
[23:38:33] <Bike> phoe: similar to the restriction on macrolet bodies referring to outside bindings
[23:39:32] <phoe> Bike: what's a good way around that? is (let* ((x 42) (closure (lambda () x))) (compile nil closure)) any more non-UB?
[23:40:05] <Bike> (funcall (compile nil '(lambda (x) (lambda () x))) 42)
[23:40:49] <Bike> or (lambda () (let ((x 42)) ...)) etc
[23:40:58] <phoe> hmm
[23:41:16] <phoe> that's one part of UB that I wasn't really aware of
[23:41:30] <phoe> and I wonder which commonly used implementations don't do the "right" thing in this case
[23:41:54] <_death> in cl-su-ai spice lisp was mentioned in this context
[23:42:46] <phoe> cl-su-ai? you mean the mailgroup?
[23:43:02] <_death> yes
[23:43:50] <_death> there's also the issue relevant to it: COMPILE-ARGUMENT-PROBLEMS-AGAIN.. and COMPILE-ARGUMENT-PROBLEMS before that (mentioned in https://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/clm/node224.html )
[23:44:49] <Bike> "The consequences of calling compile on a function that is already compiled are unspecified." yeesh, that's perverse

[23:45:57] <phoe> hey wait a second, that isn't CLHS
[23:46:09] <phoe> "If the definition is already a compiled function, compile either produces that function itself (i.e., is an identity operation) or an equivalent function."
[23:46:12] <phoe> thank goodness
[23:46:13] <Bike> yeah it's in the page death linked.
