[06:02:23] <talismanick> Not sure if maybe there was an additional package I was supposed to install  - Void Linux often splits up packages, but "R" is hard to search for

[06:11:39] <Colombo> For me, lib paths returns: [1] "/home/home/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.1" [2] "/usr/local/lib/R/site-library" [3] "/usr/lib/R/site-library" [4] "/usr/lib/R/library"

[06:13:20] <Colombo> THe default behaviour is that upon first installing package, R will ask you if you want to install it in your local user folder or not.
[06:13:40] <Colombo> You can also specify folder, but the default is the [1]
[06:13:57] <talismanick> Yes, I entered "cancel" because it wanted to create a plain, visible folder in ~

[17:14:37] <Bayes> when you have a model with interactions A, B, A*B
[17:15:23] <Bayes> you can have A and A*B not significant; A significant but A*B not significant; A not significant but A*B significant; A and A*B significant
[17:15:46] <Bayes> and for each of the four cells, it'd be nice to list the correct interpretation and also the "pitfalls"
[17:18:13] <Bayes> and I'm saying this cause I was in a situation with a collaborator where I was arguing that "There's no treatment effect" based on the linear contrast A vs B
[17:18:39] <Bayes> and my collaborator was basically writing the whole paragraph in terms of which effects are significant or not in an anova table
[17:19:31] <Bayes> in our case we had A*B*C, a three way interaction or whatever they're called, so at some point the conversation became unintelligible
