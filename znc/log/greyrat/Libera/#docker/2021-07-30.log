[02:06:41] <jochum> tell him to fool someone else.
[02:06:52] <SJr> I have docker compose running on an ec2 instance and a bunch of ports declared (e.g., ports: -2003:2003 -8125:8125). For some reason I can't connect to them except via localhost, when I nmap localhost the ports are listed as opened, when I nmap via the NIC ip they are closed. When I look at the output of ss it looks like the destination address should be 0.0.0.0:*. What else should I look at.
[02:07:31] <jochum> SJr: what gives "ss -lntp" and "iptables -L" (both as root)
[02:08:16] <jochum> Lutin: been thinking, it maybe possible - not for me.

[02:09:46] <Lutin> jochum aha!
[02:10:10] <Lutin> jochum he says he has no env to test it...so I wonder... the guy is a redhat dev

[02:26:00] <papa-dinkle> Hi everyone. I am having trouble setting permissions on a directory in a volume. I want to start the container as a non-root user, then have access to the directory in the volume from the www-data group, but the ownership of the directory is always root:root. Anyone have similar experiences that can lend some sagely wisdom?
[02:26:53] <papa-dinkle> *ownership of the directory on the volume from within the container is root:root
[02:27:04] <ada_> papa-dinkle: the common way to handle this is to set the ownership bits of the directory from a script that may run before your actual process
[02:27:17] <Lutin> ada_ its'overwritten with 127.0.0.1 and resolves using the DNS server IN the container
[02:27:35] <Lutin> ada_ indeed it's pretty hard and confusing to debug it
[02:27:59] <ada_> Lutin: well its confusing _to me_ when you leave out details is what I was getting at;  not that the problem was confusing to debug
[02:28:41] <ada_> I still don't understand the problem
[02:28:44] <Lutin> ada_not really much to add further. I have now two containers running attached to --net and with a resolv.conf of 127.0.0.1
[02:28:56] <ada_> thats trivia, it doesn't tell me anything useful

I have been trying to change ownership of the files from within the container and have had issues with it until i set up an entrypoint script which allowed me to do so. 
[21:24:29] <papa-dinkle> However, I run docker in rootless mode. Should I even be concerned if the user running container processes is root? I read up on subuids and it seems I might be protected and not need to do some complicated startup script to change owners and then drop privileges

[22:58:00] <papa-dinkle> yeah my main concern is security of host machine. I was hoping to force the process running the container to be executed as a non-root user in the container to reduce the chances of gaining privileges on host machine 
[22:59:24] <papa-dinkle> so hopefully double protection? the actual user running docker is non-root and the user inside container is non-root 
[23:01:20] <papa-dinkle> i want a packageable development environment (like fixuid addresses) but in the end i will avoid all volumes that actually touch code
[23:01:39] <papa-dinkle> and just copy code instead of developing from shared volume
[23:02:53] <papa-dinkle> it feels like i am trying to follow conflicting philosophies in terms of isolation/security

[23:39:32] <luvalon1> I am trying to mount a log file from inside the container on my host, yet when I do that, somehow instead of the logfile, there is a folder in place of the logfile with the name of the logfile and no content
[23:39:39] <luvalon1> can anyone explain why and how to fix that?=

[23:42:02] <luvalon1> https://dpaste.com/9LZWU7AQH here is how i tried to
[23:43:43] <tabakhase> luvalon1 create it first - if it doesnt exists docker thinks you want a folder (or use the parent folder) - but rly, "logs" in docker should go to stdout, from there docker picks it up and does whatevr your logging-driver dictates (common to send it further into ELK&clones for example)
[23:44:35] <luvalon1> in the container i use there are two logs somehow
[23:44:54] <luvalon1> one goes to stdout.log and one to server_config.log
[23:45:13] <luvalon1> i dont know how to change that so that the server_config.log goes also to stdout.log
[23:45:20] <tabakhase> what application is this?
[23:45:29] <luvalon1> its just a game server container

[23:48:12] <luvalon1> or how do you know
[23:48:49] <tabakhase> hm, your whois got nothing - "server_config.log stdout.log gameserver" in google finds some issue talkign about "/root/.config/supertuxkart/config-0.10/server_config.log"
[23:49:08] <luvalon1> how did you know then?
[23:49:08] <tabakhase> and "server_config.log" seems somewhat unique...
[23:49:23] <luvalon1> wow some sherlock here :D
[23:49:34] <papa-dinkle> *boggles*
[23:50:49] <tabakhase> and hm :/ usually one hack be "setting the log-paths to /dev/stdout" - but seems there lognames are somewhat hardcoded/reassembled... https://github.com/supertuxkart/stk-code/commit/6203b415e2954d237cb68c6ebbea7538f08e702d#diff-34d21af3c614ea3cee120df276c9c4ae95053830d7f1d3deaf009a4625409ad2R1810

[23:53:10] <luvalon1> im happy I dont have one attached :D akik
[23:53:19] <tabakhase> one further thing seen rather rarely - and in a way breaking docker-best-practice - be "run a init in the container, and then run your $app as well as some filefollowers to consume say a fifo thats used as logpath ((cause writing into the container-filesystem is "terrybad")) - but that all smells quite above scope for a directly ran "single docker"

[23:54:55] <tabakhase> just precreating the files to get your bind-mount to work as expected certainly smells like the most reasonable here :D
[23:55:10] <luvalon1> yeah I think everything else goes into "too much work for not enough gain"
[23:55:48] <luvalon1> but thank you a lot then
[23:57:46] <tabakhase> and hm, digging some deeper (dam github mr view collapsed some), there is a extra "--stdout" flag, but not sure if that will take care of both logs then...
