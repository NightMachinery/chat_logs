[00:44:11] <tga> greetings. is it something I'm doing or admin inlines can't change foreign keys (to random other objects, other than the parent)?
[00:44:37] <tga> if I move the same field to readonly_fields, I get a proper link for the FK -- but I can't seem to be able to change it as a regular field
[00:46:07] <tga> aaand that was caused by SortableInlineAdminMixin, quack!
[00:47:02] <PaulWay[w]> quack indeed :-)
[00:49:02] <tga> maybe I do have an actual question then, is there a simple way of limiting FKs to a custom queryset related to the parent object?
[00:49:12] <tga> everywhere for validation and especially in the admin to filter the dropdown
[00:49:33] <tga> it would be nice if I could somehow filter the fk directly in the model, to be automatically used everywhere
[00:49:39] <FunkyBob> limit_choices_to ?
[00:49:48] <wallbroken> does Django use REST API?
[00:49:52] <tga> that.. exists?
[00:49:58] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: no... REST API uses django
[00:50:12] <PaulWay[w]> wallbroken: you can provide a REST API in Django using Django REST Framework.
[00:50:13] <tga> thanks FunkyBob, TIL limit_choices_to
[00:50:23] <FunkyBob> tga: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.ForeignKey.limit_choices_to
[00:50:37] <FunkyBob> PaulWay[w]: or plain django, as wallbroken has done before
[00:50:37] <wallbroken> ok, does REST provide JSON or XML ?
[00:50:38] <tga> somehow I thought it would be a hack
[00:50:43] *** Quits: Haudegen (~quassel@178.115.237.87.static.drei.at) (Quit: No Ping reply in 180 seconds.)
[00:50:44] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: if you like, yes...
[00:50:49] <PaulWay[w]> Indeed.  DRF is just a convenient tool for it.
[00:50:49] <FunkyBob> REST doesn't say either way
[00:50:57] <wallbroken> and what is the difference between REST and SOAP ?
[00:50:57] <FunkyBob> but it's common to use JSON these days
[00:51:03] <wallbroken> ops
[00:51:04] <tga> even SOAP apparently, with a library o.O
[00:51:08] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: SOAP is... wow... where to begine
[00:51:13] <PaulWay[w]> SOAP is awful, REST less so.
[00:51:19] <FunkyBob> yeah
[00:51:37] <wallbroken> so, SOAP uses XML and REST uses JSON ?
[00:51:38] <tga> SOAP has good parts too, like formally specifying endpoints
[00:51:41] <wallbroken> is this the difference?
[00:51:43] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: no
[00:51:44] <tga> vanilla REST/JSON doesn't
[00:51:48] <PaulWay[w]> SOAP was designed by people who thought SNMP didn't go far enough in making it difficult to get information and control devices.
[00:51:56] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: as I already said, you can use XML in REST
[00:52:16] <wallbroken> ok, so, what's the diff between REST and SOAP?
[00:52:28] <PaulWay[w]> In what terms?
[00:52:30] <FunkyBob> they are entirely different protocols with entirely differnt goals
[00:52:39] <FunkyBob> SOAP can, for instance, be transported over email
[00:52:49] <FunkyBob> REST is very specifically bound to HTTP and its verbs
[00:52:52] <wallbroken> can you please tell me an usecase of both of them?
[00:53:01] <PaulWay[w]> Why?
[00:53:05] <wallbroken> verbs are GET, PUT ?
[00:53:08] <PaulWay[w]> Yes
[00:53:12] <tga> SOAP: making money as a consultant implementing it
[00:53:14] <FunkyBob> enterprise wonks will try to make you use SOAP... it will be an pain, and completely lacking in interoperability
[00:53:18] <tga> REST: getting things done
[00:53:36] <tga> GraphQL: uhh well, somewhere in between
[00:53:40] <FunkyBob> REST is a way of implementing RPC over HTTP
[00:53:54] <tga> I thought SOAP is closer to RPC
[00:54:00] <FunkyBob> SOAP can do RPC...
[00:54:02] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: do you remember my project?
[00:54:15] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: how can I forget? it's painfully seared into my memory
[00:54:20] <tga> and GraphQL is really closer to SOAP but with JSON and other goodies
[00:54:23] <PaulWay[w]> GraphQL is great, but I found it very difficult to provide a GraphQL interface when I already had a DRF-based REST interface.
[00:54:30] <FunkyBob> tga: not really
[00:54:37] <wallbroken> in that case the server provides a ready to use rendered page to the client, right?
[00:54:49] <wallbroken> it doesn't use a REST API
[00:54:50] <wallbroken> right?
[00:55:02] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: your app was a mix between traditional and SPA... and did use a REST-like API for some  things
[00:55:07] <FunkyBob> as I mentioned above
[00:55:11] <wallbroken> ok
[00:55:12] <tga> I have mixed feelings about providing GraphQL on the backend, lots of work and can't really see the benefit
[00:55:12] <FunkyBob> but you don't read r eplies, clearly
[00:55:29] <tga> and Graphene ugh
[00:55:43] <wallbroken> and you said that most of API responses are plain text, right?
[00:55:45] <tga> I'm not taking new projects that use that, it's jsut a pain to use
[00:55:47] <wallbroken> not JSON structure
[00:55:54] <FunkyBob> tga: it's a lot like adding a query language on your DBMS... it lets  the end user issue queries you didn't pre-concieve
[00:56:00] <tga> ooh yeah
[00:56:02] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: I never said that
[00:56:17] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: the RESTful endpoints on your app were using JSON
[00:56:17] <tga> it lets the end user blow up your database with queries you never thought of
[00:56:24] <FunkyBob> that's why there's JsonResponse used in your views
[00:56:56] <PaulWay[w]> If you want to confuse things, then JSON is also plain text... :-)
[00:57:15] <tga> XML too
[00:57:17] <PaulWay[w]> But why this sudden interest in SOAP, wallbroken?
[00:57:28] <PaulWay[w]> EBCDIC is so rare these days...
[00:57:47] <FunkyBob> PaulWay[w]: YOU CAN PRY MY AS/400 FROM MY ..... oh, never mind
[00:57:58] <PaulWay[w]> Ta
[00:58:24] <tga> I just got questions about an old SOAP project the other week, not only it's still in heavy use but they're actively developing it
[00:58:27] <wallbroken> because I've taken a job application as django developer, and during the interview, one of the questions was "what is the difference between REST and SOAP?"
[00:58:30] <tga> enterprise++
[00:58:52] <tga> rest = more convention, soap = more xml
[00:59:25] <tga> also, nobody does real rest, no matter what they say/think
[00:59:52] <tga> backend-for-frontend ftw
[01:00:07] <anddam> PaulWay[w]: I heard a podcast (likely Talk Python to me) about HTMX and I was intrigued, I was thinking about it today since I am taking on a personal project
[01:00:08] <PaulWay[w]> And back when I was working with a SOAP interface on a GPON I found it incredibly finicky about the order of fields that I supplied.
[01:00:16] <FunkyBob> REST is based on the seminal paper by Roy Fielding
[01:00:32] <FunkyBob> SOAP was built by MS and other enterprisey people to be universal, but just wound up being a fucking mess
[01:00:37] <anddam> PaulWay[w]: so to answer "anyone here used" I can say a sound "No, but I'd like to"
[01:00:46] <PaulWay[w]> anddam: I've been working on it a bit :-)
[01:00:52] <PaulWay[w]> So I can tell you what I've done.
[01:00:56] <anddam> PaulWay[w]: on it or with it?
[01:01:33] <PaulWay[w]> With it.  Implementing https://github.com/PaulWay/Django-Dictgame
[01:01:57] <tga> intercooler was alright, but I always ended up with a vue widget or a full react spa
[01:02:43] <anddam> on the SOAP topic I can contribute that lately I had to make a SOAP client in Python, I did not know SOAP, had never used suds before, I had to inject SAML authentication in it and I was miserable the whole time
[01:02:55] <tga> case in point: this project I'm working on now needed a two-column select list -- I sketched up a server-only solution but ended up with an inline vue widget, so much simpler
[01:03:10] <FunkyBob> friend of mine tryied to replace soappy or whatever it was [nightmare] with something built on stock modern tools
[01:03:20] <anddam> PaulWay[w]: I'd like to produce html snippets as output and avoid DRF at this round
[01:03:27] <PaulWay[w]> I'm trying to work out how, for instance, to have a div that displays a new form if it doesn't have data, displays an edit form if it does have data, and just displays the data when the question is no longer editable.
[01:03:29] <wallbroken> curl --data 'url=tpportal/tpl/journeyPatterns/87|1%3FalternativeRoutesMode%3Dfalse' https://giromilano.atm.it/proxy.ashx
[01:03:36] <wallbroken> is this an example of REST API?
[01:03:37] <FunkyBob> https://pypi.org/project/rinse/
[01:03:38] <tga> I used to do SOAP in .net, not so bad with all the codegen, you'd get a magical interface object that just talked to the thing
[01:04:09] <FunkyBob> tga: from the XSD, yes?
[01:04:19] <tga> wsdl and xsd, yeah
[01:04:22] <wallbroken> tga: do you also use mvc?
[01:04:23] <FunkyBob> first XSD I write... the client complained because their libs couldn't ingest it
[01:04:31] <FunkyBob> didn't support all sorts of features of the langauge
[01:04:41] <tga> mvc _and_ mvvc
[01:04:43] <FunkyBob> so I fixed it for them... and the second client complained
[01:04:56] <PaulWay[w]> wallbroken: that interview question sounds really like a "let's see if we can trick them up with a question that requires specialised knowledge" question.
[01:04:58] <FunkyBob> so... fuck interop
[01:05:14] <FunkyBob> tga: and MVA, and... other design patterns?
[01:05:44] <tga> the soap question was put there to filter out the younguns who never heard of it
[01:05:51] <PaulWay[w]> Yep.
[01:06:12] <PaulWay[w]> And I think the correct response would be "Why, do you use a lot of SOAP interfaces in your business?"
[01:06:21] <PaulWay[w]> If the answer is yes, then politely leave.
[01:06:37] <PaulWay[w]> If the answer is no, then "Then why ask about something you don't really care about?"
[01:06:58] <tga> in my case it was a gov data interchange, it's SOAP or GTFO
[01:07:25] <PaulWay[w]> Yeah, same, Cisco GPONs for a company.  They only spoke SOAP because HTTP was so new...

[01:12:49] <anddam> wallbroken: is this a first job?
[01:13:00] <PaulWay[w]> anddam: that's why I'm using that.  The REST API was a 'just in case'.
[01:13:02] <wallbroken> anddam: no
[01:13:13] <anddam> PaulWay[w]: yep, I am curious too
[01:13:34] <tga> I have a moderately complex nested data model and having FK show _all_ objects instead of children of the same parent makes it almost impossible to use
[01:13:41] <anddam> PaulWay[w]: that reads """wondering if you can manage your whole "API" in django templates"""
[01:13:45] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: yes
[01:14:31] <anddam> wallbroken: I am a bit surprised since seems you have not even met REST or SOAP, and while it's all the better for you it's hard nowadays
[01:14:36] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: that's how all URL endpoints are defined in django
[01:14:50] <tga> I was looking at react-admin the other day, any idea if anyone tried to adapt it for the django admin?
[01:14:59] <tga> https://marmelab.com/react-admin/
[01:15:01] <wallbroken> anddam: i never designed API's
[01:15:23] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: an API is just a way for one bit of code to call another
[01:15:40] <PaulWay[w]> That's why it's an Interface.
[01:16:16] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: an API is a way to tell the server what kind of response you need
[01:16:18] <FunkyBob> inter-face... between two surfaces
[01:16:30] <tga> as a first run I'd suggest you just manually define endpoints that output and receive data, don't worry about REST and all the other conventions
[01:16:31] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: pardon?

[01:17:04] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: look at your cart, for instancve...
[01:17:10] <FunkyBob> your JS posts data, and gets a response
[01:17:43] <FunkyBob> all the parts where your Javascript makes an request with data, and gets a response... they're API calls
[01:18:31] <tga> wallbroken: to answer the question literally, a HTTP request can specify a list of formats the server can send in the Accept header
[01:18:40] <tga> that's probably not what you want though
[01:19:33] <tga> theoretically a client could go Accept: application/xml vs application/json or whatever the real content types are, and the server would know to send back the same data but in a different format
[01:19:50] <FunkyBob> practically, everyone uses JSON
[01:19:59] <FunkyBob> limited as it is
[01:20:22] <tga> something really nice I remember from web2py was that you could call any url with .json at the end and get the context dict without passing it through the template

[01:21:58] <tga> single file deployment was awesome, the integrated dev environment was nice

[13:31:53] <pycode> do you remember the chat about the slug, yesterday... we talked about a Model method called create_project() to 1. create the new project 2. add the slug with an update i am thinking instead of overriding the save() method, why not override the create() method of the manager? i mean... it is an operation i need to do during creating so instead of creating create_project() i can simply override the create(). no? what do you think ?

[18:00:29] <pycode> hey i wonder how could i implement a form inside a listview, is there possibile somehow? i need to show a list of objects and then create a form to save leads
[18:00:36] <pycode> but can i manage that form inside a listview?
[18:00:39] <pycode> if yes...how? :D
[18:03:16] <moldy> pycode: the most common pattern is to put the form into the template and point it at a different view
[18:03:31] <moldy> using action=
[18:13:20] <pycode> moldy, yes but after a submit i need to refresh that listview, or if there were validation errors
[18:13:24] <pycode> i must remain in the same view
[18:13:28] <pycode> should i redirect?
[18:13:42] <pycode> i mean, i can put the form and point to another view but then redirect back to that listview moldy ?
[18:13:43] <moldy> pycode: that is usually best, yes
[18:13:46] <pycode> ok
[18:14:18] <pycode> maybe i can create an hidden inpuit field called "redirect" to undertsand where to redirect after the submit
[18:14:27] <pycode> with the success or error list
[18:15:02] <pycode> but wait how can i show the error list? i mean i have the form object in the listview, if i submit to another action

[19:01:51] <CodenameTim> ijpiantanida: This was implemented/fixed back in 1.11: https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/22288
[19:02:06] <CodenameTim> Not saying that it didn't break since then, but it should be possible.
[19:04:49] <CodenameTim> ijpiantanida: I was able to confirm this works in one of my projects using django 3.2, but it was using datetime fields.

[19:06:53] <moldy> ijpiantanida: i'm not sure :)
[19:07:13] <ijpiantanida> CodenameTim: the range query works fine with int fields. It's with datetime that it doesn't
[19:07:33] *** Joins: nicode (~nic@45.72.243.59)
[19:07:54] <moldy> i'm just saying that if similar sql also returns no results, that would be interesting. which db is this?
[19:08:07] <CodenameTim> You could throw these queries into a simple view, then use the debug toolbar to inspect the actual queries being run.
[19:08:22] <ijpiantanida> sqlite
[19:09:05] <ijpiantanida> The query is being logged as `SELECT "catalog_testobject"."id", "catalog_testobject"."start", "catalog_testobject"."end", "catalog_testobject"."middle" FROM "catalog_testobject" WHERE "catalog_testobject"."middle" BETWEEN 'Col(catalog_testobject, catalog.TestObject.start)' AND '2021-10-09' LIMIT 21; args=('Col(catalog_testobject,
[19:09:05] <ijpiantanida> catalog.TestObject.start)', '2021-10-09')`.
[19:09:41] <ijpiantanida> But I'm not sure what the value of 'Col(catalog_testobject, catalog.TestObject.start)' should be. Hope it's not that raw string :D
[19:11:09] <CodenameTim> Wouldn't sqlite throw an error about mismatched types for that comparison?
[19:15:46] <ijpiantanida> it just casts it I imagine
[19:17:21] <moldy> googling a little suggests that sqlite compares dates as strings if it doesn't like the formatting
[19:20:02] <CodenameTim> ijpiantanida: I've confirmed __range and F() works with DateField and DateTimeFields with postgresql. If there is a bug, it seems likely it's related to sqlite.
[19:20:13] <CodenameTim> Well the sqlite integration.
