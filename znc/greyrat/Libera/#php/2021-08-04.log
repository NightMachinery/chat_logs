[00:48:29] <Albright> https://3v4l.org/TpdBS - What's the logic here? Why does this print "truetrue" instead of "foofalsebartrue"?
[00:49:05] <Albright> I know if you put the tertiary operator part in parentheses, you get expected behavior.
[00:49:17] <Albright> But I don't get the logic of what it's doing without them.
[00:56:06] <AllenJB> "." has higher precedence than "? :" so, what you're executing is ("foo" . false) ? "true" : "false"; , so it's testing if "foo" is true, which it is (since it's non-empty string)
[00:56:20] <AllenJB> Operator precedence tables: https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.precedence.php
[00:56:31] <s17> yes
[00:57:22] <AllenJB> IMO when using ?? or ? : you should always use ( ) to specify exactly what you intend. Not every developer can hold precedence tables in their head and it makes the intended execution much quicker and easier to read
[00:58:16] <Albright> Ah, hmm. That makes sense. Thanks.
[00:58:47] <Albright> And you're right. I should learn to be explicit when trying to do that sort of thing.

[15:58:31] <olle> Question: About database migrations when using two branches, dev and master. Bug fixas are applied to master, new features to dev. 8 week rolling release schedule. Both bug fixes and new features require database migrations. How to tag them so they end up in the correct order without merge conflicts?
[15:58:53] <olle> Only a timestamp won't work.
[15:59:38] <olle> Unless applied differently for bug fixes and features, that is, bug fixes timestamp at date of create, features timestamp at day of next release
[16:03:21] <Naktibalda> don't you track what migrations had been applied?
[16:04:52] <Naktibalda> a few migration tools I am familiar with store migration state in database, so if bugfix migration was applied before it won't be executed again.

[16:07:24] <olle> We only track the last applied migration.
[16:07:40] <olle> Maybe that needs to change. :d
[16:08:51] <olle> So if a feature is added before a bug fix, but applied after (when merged into master), it won't be executed. Hm.
[16:09:17] <Naktibalda> you could use semantic versioning scheme at the beginning of migration name.
[16:10:52] <olle> Naktibalda: Prefix the timestamp with a manual version number? Yes, I've thought about that. We are using semver already, so could be natural.
[16:11:21] <olle> So you'll sort by semver first and timestamp after.

[17:27:36] <Poboy> olle no sir/ma'am
[17:28:10] <olle> ^^
[17:28:19] <Poboy> So does one person start doing something 1 way, and then they just convince enough people to hop on board their bandwagon and then the rest of us are pretty much forced to do so as well?
[17:28:28] <olle> "one" person?
[17:28:35] <Poboy> Yeah, someone had to start it
[17:28:40] <Poboy> somebody said "this is a good idea"
[17:28:46] <__adrian> i'd reduce that to just "what?"
[17:28:55] <olle> Like, the designer of Lisp?
[17:29:29] <Blondie101010> Poboy:  you're not forced to use arrow functions
[17:30:05] <Poboy> blah
[17:30:19] <olle> Blondie101010: He *is* forced to read them. Forever.
[17:30:26] <Poboy> if you're using code where others do it, then sure, you may not be shot on sight but you're pretty much forced to
[17:30:31] <Blondie101010> if your concern is that you have to learn and get used to new stuff, then such is life
[17:30:45] <Poboy> Blondie101010 that's the point
[17:30:53] <Blondie101010> that means you're old :P
[17:30:56] <Poboy> we have to learn and get used to new stuff, why exactly?
[17:31:07] <Poboy> because some person thought it was cool and got people to hop on the bandwagon
[17:31:09] <olle> Why not? :D
[17:31:13] <__adrian> Poboy: fn ($n) => "enjoy, {$n}"
[17:31:28] <olle> Expressive power, but I think that's not such a good reason.
[17:31:43] <Poboy> Can't they see how ugly it is though?
[17:31:47] <olle> Not if correctness and readability is your first concerns.
[17:31:48] <__adrian> Poboy: that's absurd. but if you don't like something, don't use it. just be aware that you might leave yourself behind.
[17:31:59] <Poboy> Not really a huge deal, but these are the thoughts that go through my head
[17:32:43] <olle> Speak not of "ugly" in PHP channel... $dollarSignEveryWhere...
[17:32:55] <Poboy> everywhere?  I'd hope not!

[18:21:21] <olle> So, about plugin systems and event. I'm thinking about adding support to extend existing forms by letting a plugin return a list of objects representing form elements.
[18:21:36] <olle> Is there a framework that implements a similar system already?
[18:23:09] <Albright> There is in Drupal. Not sure if it's usable outside of it.

[18:29:06] <Albright> Yeah, and modules can modify it to add its own fields, validation handlers, etc.
[18:29:43] <Albright> Well, yes. It makes sense if you think of form fields as having an "order" on the page.
[18:30:39] <olle> I'd expect a collection or internal array for that, but it's ok

[23:18:52] <dukenukem3d> I have a system that when hitting an error often does endless redirects to / , where the error is. Where might be that redirect cause, I have no idea what the error is, no entry in apache's error logfiles. I can give an example line that never returns:
[23:19:09] <dukenukem3d> session_start(['use_only_cookies'=>0,use_trans_sid=>1]);

[23:20:49] <__adrian> (a) do you see the problem when loading a non-php-script webpage? this sounds more like a webserver issue. (b) you SHOULD NOT be setting either of those session options
[23:21:02] <__adrian> ((b) they are unsafe)
[23:23:39] <dukenukem3d> apache has a quiet fresh config and error pages (tested 404) are OK! php is fresh installed but I need to make old scripts run. They still rely on transparent session id
[23:24:19] <__adrian> session_start() doesn't cause a redirect. do you have other code that does?
[23:25:16] <__adrian> regarding unlogged errors, !+error logging
[23:25:16] <php-bot> regarding unlogged errors, In addition to configuring error reporting (/msg php-bot error reporting), set log_errors=1 and error_log=/path/to/your/error.log in your php.ini file. This allows you to simply tail the log to see errors, and to disable display_errors (e.g., during production).
[23:25:23] <dukenukem3d> fixed several errors already where some did just the same, and SOME told the error since I activated display errors (develop mode). Why do not all errors just display? :(
[23:25:44] <__adrian> generally you don't want to display errors. log them.
[23:25:56] <__adrian> as for why they might not be displayed/logged, see above
[23:26:07] <dukenukem3d> Oh I have an error handler.. that might be the cause
