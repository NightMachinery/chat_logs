[06:52:57] <gtlsgamr> Arya can you still play games using prime run? Or having fps issues lately?
[06:57:48] <Arya[m]> i am using my intel pc a lot more so cant say
[06:57:54] <Arya[m]> moreover i dont play that many games
[06:58:07] <Arya[m]> mostly just cli/emacs games
[07:47:53] <_devnull[m]> <PriyanshuRai[m]> "It's not. We chose the harder..." <- many of us would have installed linux so their friends wont bother them fix their windows installation. cuz they can think "he dont use windows so he can't help." üòÇ
[07:48:42] <_devnull[m]> I mean shoo man shoo I don't use that crap get away from me or install Linux.
[07:49:39] <Arya[m]> üòÜ 
[08:20:25] <gtlsgamr> I have switched fully these days
[08:20:27] <gtlsgamr> no more windows
[08:20:33] <gtlsgamr> but gaming is giving me a little trouble
[08:21:02] <ramram[m]> gtlsgamr: which games ?
[08:21:27] <gtlsgamr> Red dead online, DOOM Eternal, DOOM 3, 
[08:22:02] <ramram[m]> i don't know about red dead but the other two i have played already in past, works fine with wine lutris
[08:23:19] <gtlsgamr> Do you use nvidia
[08:23:20] <gtlsgamr> ?
[08:23:38] <ramram[m]> gtlsgamr: no i have amd ryzen apu
[08:23:46] <gtlsgamr> That's why
[08:23:47] <ramram[m]> i think it is ryzen 3 3200g
[08:24:21] <ramram[m]> gtlsgamr: may be, where did you downloaded them ?
[08:24:32] <ramram[m]> * may be, where did you download
[08:24:32] <ramram[m]>  them ?
[08:25:07] <gtlsgamr> steam
[08:25:09] <gtlsgamr> I own them

[09:06:58] <pystardust> gtlsgamr: wanna work on the gnulinuxindia server?
[09:07:21] *** Joins: YashMoon[m] (~telegram3@2001:470:69fc:105::1:43d0)
[09:09:02] <pystardust> im thinking of hosting a mail server, nginx and maybe a chat server (xmpp or matrix), Arya[m], palwd[m] would you be interested too?
[09:11:13] <_devnull[m]> https://t.me/+9FZzrMru6L5jODkx
[09:19:30] <Arya[m]> <pystardust> "im thinking of hosting a mail..." <- sure
[09:19:34] <Arya[m]> i can help
[09:28:02] <JB[m]> @pystardust hey you still intrested in cryptography?
[09:33:57] <gtlsgamr> pystardust: I am available too
[09:48:18] <gtlsgamr> pystardust: a znc instance would be nice too!
[09:58:46] <pystardust> JB[m]: yessss
[09:58:52] <pystardust> gtlsgamr: im hosting a linode instance
[09:59:05] <Arya[m]> what specs?
[09:59:07] <pystardust> if you dm ur personal ssh key ill add you in
[09:59:17] <pystardust> public *** xd
[09:59:26] <pystardust> Arya[m]: going basic, the cheapest plan
[09:59:32] <Arya[m]> oh nice
[09:59:37] <Arya[m]> matrix will prob not run then
[09:59:51] <Arya[m]> matrix is really memory and cpu intensive
[10:01:33] <pystardust> ill open a wallet for crypto donations, if we get even line a lil like 20 rupees ish from some people then we can upgrade to better plan. I thing the 5 dollar is more than enough for nginx, znc, mailserver, xmpp, mumble, irc server. all together (jitsi and matrix server are very intensive_
[10:01:57] <Arya[m]> yeah
[10:03:19] <pystardust> gtlsgamr: on a side note, I want to make a irc bouncer, such that it will send store and send message to both my phone and the computer even if one of them is offline it will buffer and send, you wanna join?
[10:10:47] <pal[m]> <pystardust> "im thinking of hosting a mail..." <- Would love to, but im still a nooob in all of this
[10:11:23] <gtlsgamr> pystardust: We can make one, but it is a lot more complicated than you think
[10:11:32] <gtlsgamr> What language are you thiking of
[10:11:44] <pystardust> pal[m]: its all the same, reading the documentation on how to set up and following instructions
[10:12:06] <pystardust> gtlsgamr: python async, the socketing with ssl has really functions
[10:12:23] <pal[m]> pystardust: Ait man Im in
[10:12:29] <pystardust> gtlsgamr: yes it is kinda complicated but the irc protocol is very simple
[10:12:32] <pystardust> pal[m]: less go!!
[10:15:14] <gtlsgamr> To kab shuru karna hai>
[10:15:46] <Arya[m]> pystardust: aldready got vps?
[10:16:05] <pystardust> Arya[m]: signing up into linode, making it
[10:16:13] <gtlsgamr> What domain are you getting
[10:16:18] <pystardust> gnulinuxindia.org
[10:16:26] <gtlsgamr> Nice
[10:16:31] <Arya[m]> pystardust: üëçÔ∏è
[10:16:34] <pystardust> im not liking vultr, they are being a pain for opening ports so trying linode
[10:16:48] <gtlsgamr> Why
[10:16:51] <Arya[m]> pystardust: for mail you need to contact linode support
[10:16:53] <gtlsgamr> pystardust: just use ufw
[10:17:02] <Arya[m]> but thy will allow easily
[10:17:04] <Arya[m]> thats what i have heard
[10:17:26] <pystardust> gtlsgamr: no, ik ufw to open ports, vultr block mail ports
[10:17:34] <pystardust> its not related to software, they hardblock it
[10:17:39] <Arya[m]> many vps providers do
[10:17:44] <Arya[m]> Arya[m]: this 
[10:18:18] <pystardust> yeah, I created a fresh account so that its not associated with my personal account incase someelse maintains it later on
[10:19:02] <Arya[m]> nice
[10:19:09] <pal[m]> Arya[m]: Yeah I think its coz many ppl abuse these for sending spam
[10:19:34] <Arya[m]> yeah
[10:21:54] <gtlsgamr> Nice work mr pystardust
[10:21:59] <gtlsgamr> You are a gem of this community
[10:22:50] <JB[m]> <pystardust> "gtlsgamr: on a side note, I want..." <- I wanna join the development :)
[10:23:53] <Arya[m]> pystardust: what are you going to use for the website. Plain html, bashblog, or a SSG
[10:25:34] <gtlsgamr> I think SSG is a better choice
[10:26:25] <Arya[m]> bashblog seems interesting
[10:26:46] <Arya[m]> https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog
[10:28:38] <gtlsgamr> Bashblog is interesting

[10:39:11] <pystardust> JB[m]: yes yes, this is our server, its fun doing it together
[10:39:23] <pystardust> gtlsgamr: I don't think it would be a problem
[10:40:38] <gtlsgamr> MY FUCKING STEAM IS BROKEN some one pls help me :(((
[10:41:04] <pystardust> gtlsgamr: why would the fsf take issue in that? this is a non profit website we are making not on behalf of them but our community (there is already fsf india) this is gnulinuxindia
[10:41:32] <gtlsgamr> True true. I was thinking of the name gnulinux. I think we can make one
[10:41:35] <pystardust> gtlsgamr: my steam broke yesterday, i downgraded from proton experimental to 6.3 and it worked
[10:41:35] <gtlsgamr> no issues
[10:41:36] <Arya[m]> pystardust: gnuindia.org
[10:41:39] <Arya[m]> lol
[10:41:53] <Arya[m]> gtlsgamr: not playing games = solution
[10:42:03] <pystardust> xd, I already bought gnulinuxindia.org :P rn
[10:42:05] <gtlsgamr> Okay luke smith XD
[10:42:16] <pystardust> okay boomer
[10:42:28] <gtlsgamr> I told Arya[m] not you
[10:42:33] <pystardust> me too

[11:01:16] <Arya[m]> one sec
[11:01:51] <Arya[m]> logged in 
[11:01:55] <Arya[m]> works
[11:01:57] <pystardust> gtlsgamr, Arya[m]: I have added a Action-log in the HOME dir, make a note of all edits you make there
[11:02:25] <pystardust> Arya[m]: nice, ill set up basic nginx and configure certs
[11:02:41] <Arya[m]> :+1:
[11:03:47] <Arya[m]> thats a minimal debian server tho
[11:03:58] <Arya[m]> 396 pkgs is pretty small for debian
[11:05:08] <gtlsgamr> Nice work pystardust!
[11:05:13] <gtlsgamr> reboot
[11:05:52] <pystardust> gtlsgamr: reboot?
[11:06:41] <Arya[m]> its not windows, why reboot
[11:08:52] <gtlsgamr> I was typing into dmenu and typed here
[11:08:55] <gtlsgamr> ignore
[11:09:22] <pystardust> xd
[11:09:25] <Arya[m]> lol
[11:11:24] <Arya[m]> pystardust: you gonna use bashblog or plain?
[11:13:34] <pystardust> pystardust: idk what bashblog is, but i feel it would be fun we made our own blog script
[11:13:42] <pystardust> Arya[m]: xd i tagged myself
[11:15:09] <Arya[m]> pystardust: üòÜ 
[11:22:21] <pystardust> Arya[m]: what you upto?
[11:22:48] <Arya[m]> nothing 
[11:25:04] <Arya[m]> I can access the site now
[11:26:28] <Glizzster[m]> have anyone made an dmenu dictionary script?
[11:28:04] <Arya[m]> https://github.com/defCoding/rofi-dictionary
[11:28:09] <Arya[m]> i found this 
[11:28:28] <Glizzster[m]> oh thanks
[11:28:55] <Glizzster[m]> ahh shit
[11:29:01] <Glizzster[m]> that only works in rofi i guess
[11:29:17] <Glizzster[m]> i didnt knew oxford dictionary had an api, i will try to make it in dmenu
[11:29:29] <pystardust> Arya[m]: don't add people to root, ill make user accounts and add others, so and give access only to website
[11:29:57] <pystardust> Glizzster[m]: look at sdcv offline dictionary
[11:29:58] <Arya[m]> Glizzster[m]: they use rofi -dmenu 
[11:30:10] <Glizzster[m]> pystardust: oh okay
[11:30:16] <Arya[m]> so you should just be able to replace rofi -dmenu with dmenu
[11:30:29] <Glizzster[m]> uhm
[11:30:37] <Arya[m]> pystardust: ok
[11:42:47] <irc-open-up> Glizzster[m]: hi ! are you gtls ?
[11:50:56] <Arya[m]> nopes
[11:52:42] <Arya[m]> pystardust: should we create a different room for the website so that we dont spam this one with info about that?
[11:55:09] <Arya[m]> pystardust: the -g option only takes in number input
[12:06:25] <pystardust> Arya[m]:  The group name or number of the user's initial login group. (useradd manual)
[12:06:35] <Arya[m]> ok
[12:06:47] <pystardust> Arya[m]: yeah maybe ill make a new irc channel?
[12:07:00] <Arya[m]> yes 
[12:07:09] <Arya[m]> its autobridged to matrix so that should not be an issue
[12:07:16] <pystardust> or wait, we can host a xmpp server or irc server on our server and use that instead
[12:07:27] <gtlsgamr> I think libera is fine
[12:07:28] <Arya[m]> ok
[12:07:32] <Arya[m]> prosody
[12:07:33] <gtlsgamr> More accessiblity
[12:07:38] <gtlsgamr> No seperate server
[12:07:38] <Arya[m]> xmpp allows vc too
[12:07:49] <gtlsgamr> we can just make #gnulinuxindia-admin
[12:08:02] <Arya[m]> it will be easier if we can do everything related to server on xmpp
[12:08:25] <Arya[m]> gtlsgamr: tell me after you make it
[12:08:59] <pystardust> gtlsgamr: yes for now libera should do ig, make one
[12:09:47] <Arya[m]> if we setup xmpp on the server now and use that every time the server reboots we will lose connection which isnt viable. so for now liberia should do
[12:10:21] <Arya[m]> pystardust: do you use wall command for the broadcast message?
[12:13:19] <pystardust> Arya[m]: yes
[12:13:34] <Arya[m]> ok
[12:13:56] <pystardust> Arya[m]: server will never need to reboot from now
[12:13:58] <Arya[m]> btw would it be easier if we use a git repo instead of giving a person access to the /var/www dir
[12:14:12] <pystardust> Arya[m]: yeah we ll host gitea
[12:14:16] <Arya[m]> pystardust: yup. but it would if its windows lol
[12:14:18] <gtlsgamr> pystardust: Arya[m]: You can join #sugnulinuxindia

[12:30:58] <klimi[m]> how do you manage that server will never need to reboot
[12:31:02] <klimi[m]> because we have to do that
[12:31:18] <klimi[m]> oh right you don't see replies on irc right?
[12:31:52] <pystardust> klimi[m]: normally we don't need to reboot right
[12:31:58] <pystardust> klimi[m]: yeah replies are trucated
[12:33:14] <klimi[m]> well you what about kernel upgrades?
[12:33:47] <pystardust> debian 10, kernel updates happen without rebood right?
[12:52:57] <klimi[m]> how can you update kernel without reboot?
[12:53:25] <klimi[m]> you could use KSPLICE or something... (we use that) but still have to make reboot from time to time
[13:14:29] <Arya[m]> livee kernel patching?

[13:20:42] <pal[m]> Hey @pystardust Im making an alias for the transmission-remote -a command, in my function do I need to quote protect $1?
[13:21:40] <pystardust> pal[m]: alias cant have $1, only functions can
[13:22:10] <pal[m]> Yee thats what I meant
[13:22:25] <pystardust> if ur creating a function and executing, then something like this: transmission-remote -a "$1"
[13:22:36] <pal[m]> Ait
[13:22:39] <pal[m]> Thanks!
[13:22:43] <pystardust> i just do alias tsm='transmission-remote', and then do tsm -a ,tsm -l
[13:23:28] <pal[m]> Yeah im aliasing all the common tasks I do
[13:23:58] <pal[m]> Like tsmr for removing without the deleting, tsmd to delete, tsmf to show file contents
[13:24:51] <pal[m]> I got confused with quoting part because when using the command from the terminal I already quote the magnet link
[13:25:12] <pal[m]> So I thought quoting $1 again would become redundant
[13:33:03] <pystardust> pal[m]: thats a lot of aliasing man, i used to do that first but found the flags pretty nice and short, also easy to look up man. I usually only alias the base command
[13:35:33] <pal[m]> lol maybe, Ill see if I find this more convenient and ifnot ill just go back to aliasing the base command

[16:40:59] <relejek[m]>  That is FLOSS and a danm good alt to a proprietary s/w (app) that they might using daily.
[16:41:37] <Arya[m]> day to day apps
[16:41:41] <Arya[m]> libreoffice
[16:41:45] <Arya[m]> firefox
[16:44:12] <relejek[m]> I give my friends  libreoffice without labels. They don't know they are using not-msOffice
[16:44:26] <pystardust> relejek[m]: matrix (element) is also pretty cool compared to other chat apps
[16:45:03] <relejek[m]> And it has msoffice like theming option so it looks the same inside aswell 
[16:46:58] <relejek[m]> pystardust:  sus!! Coz I am here using matrix and you're over there on irc,  telling others to use matrix. 
[16:47:02] <relejek[m]> üòë
[16:49:26] <Arya[m]> lol
[16:49:32] <pystardust> XD, its a very attractive app to get non tech ppl into. But if ur techy guy and like simple stuff then irc! 
[16:50:13] <pystardust[m]> I am here too üòõ
[16:50:16] <relejek[m]> Is irc e2ee? pystardust Arya 
[16:50:30] <pystardust> No, its meant for public chat
[16:50:57] <relejek[m]> pystardust: fair enough 
[16:50:59] <pystardust> Its ssl, so stuff is still encrypted but not at the server
[16:51:40] <relejek[m]> Are you using it on smartphone  or pc?
[16:51:47] <pystardust> And if you host ur own server, then you can say u have total control, hosting and irc server is very very light weight
[16:51:58] <pystardust> Im currently on my phone, but i use on both
[16:52:40] <relejek[m]> pystardust: What FLOSS app do you use to access Irc?
[16:52:55] <pystardust> catgirl

[16:59:28] <relejek[m]> pystardust: you're God danm right. I can't sell irc to a Luddite. Its too plain, no e2ee for private chat. No audio msg, can't  render images inline  or share images altogether. 
[16:59:48] <relejek[m]> üòë Wut shit
[17:01:51] <pystardust> We have matrix for that, and irc is not meant to send media. It does one thing and does it well, sending text. Images can be sent through text urls, using pastebins. And there are client that render images. Similarly for other media
[17:02:29] <ramram[m]> <Glizzster[m]> "have anyone made an dmenu..." <- you should try sdcv (stardict dictionary) it's too good, you can add multiple dictionaries in it.
[17:08:03] <relejek[m]> pystardust: I can respect that. For many decades irc has stood for danm simple group text chat. And  it does it best. And it is Self hostable .
[17:08:19] <relejek[m]> What do you think of xmpp?

[17:10:10] <gtlsgamr> HOW DY
[17:10:17] <relejek> This stuff is feather light.  Straight,  no bullshit 
[17:10:33] <pystardust> Xmpp is very very secure, hosting it is also not too difficult, good encryption, very lightweight on server. Its the ideal chat platform
[17:10:50] <pystardust> Yess, relejek u have a bouncer?
[17:12:09] <relejek> What do you mean, WhatsApp uses xmpp? Don't they use signal (whisper protocol)
[17:13:04] <relejek> What is bouncer?  And that should tell you, I dont have it.

[17:14:11] <gtlsgamr> bye
[17:14:40] <relejek[m]> gtlsgamr:  bye
[17:14:54] <pystardust> Xmpp is a protocol, its a way to convert message data into certain format before sending. And whatsapp uses that protocol
[17:17:09] <relejek[m]> Hmmm matrix provides bridges to connect other platform and thats the only plus I can figure out over xmpp for users
[17:18:08] <Abhi[m]> Xmpp superior
[17:22:13] <pystardust> Abhi[m]: hows college dude? How was thr flash course xd
[17:26:30] <pystardust> relejek[m]: irc is so minimal that the server doest store messages at all, it gets what to send and sends it. Thats all. So if ur offline and someone sends u a message u wont get it. The job of storing messages when ur away is given to something called asa bouncer. If u want to get messages when ur away then u can make a bouncer account that will hold the messages for you when ur away and relay it to you u come online
[17:27:16] <relejek[m]> <Abhi[m]> "Xmpp superior" <- Yes, technically it is efficient.  Lacks features though. Matrix provides the same stuff and more, albeit it is heavy on the server.
[17:30:48] <pystardust> We are got a server and are planning to host stuff on it. gnulinuxindia.org . Currently im funding it from my pocket, so the server can only handle lightweight apps, we can host prosody (xmpp server) and an irc server. But matrix would not run, maybe if we get donations for it we could host matrix and jitsi etc
[17:32:53] <relejek[m]> pystardust: at least do xmpp
[17:35:54] <relejek[m]> We do not have an Indian alt for liberapay.  Conversion cost is a drag.
[17:41:28] <gtlsgamr>  pystardust: IRC server for only our group is actually too much with too little return. Because people have one more server to configure. I suggest we use libera since most FLOSS communities use it anyway
[17:41:40] <gtlsgamr> Hosting a seperate IRC server for our small group is overkill imo
[17:42:15] <relejek[m]> pystardust: please do wallabag server. I desperately need an alt for pockets(read it later) where I can get backup easily. I feel locked in.
[17:42:19] <relejek[m]> üòî
[17:44:27] <Arya[m]> bookmarks
[19:08:38] <pystardust> relejek[m]: I will do xmpp but people wont use it :(, if people come ill be really happy
[19:09:34] <pystardust> ihv heard of wallabag, but I don't think we can handle a wallabag accound for many people in the basic plan
[19:10:14] <Arya[m]> pystardust: i put bashblog on gnulinuxindia.org 
[19:10:21] <Arya[m]> see if it looks good
[19:16:13] <gtlsgamr> Whats up
[19:16:58] <Arya[m]> nothing much
[19:21:12] <gtlsgamr> Nice bashblog btw
[19:22:31] <Arya[m]> thx

[20:27:21] <relejek[m]> Arya:  good thing to start with a bashblog. Every community needs a storyline. 
[20:31:24] <relejek[m]> pystardust:  as arya did. A blog is the best place to start. Now what could be the next service that would promote FLOSS and benefit a niche set of users.
