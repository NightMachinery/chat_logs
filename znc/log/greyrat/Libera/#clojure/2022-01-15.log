[20:50:56] <tatsumaru> what does it mean that some language is good for scripting? is clojure good as a scripting language?
[20:52:34] <ridcully> this term often means to write small cli tools.  clojure itself might not be that, because it will take some 0.5s to start up.  but babashka is (which basically is clojure)
[20:58:21] <technomancy> tatsumaru: "scripting" can either be a derogatory term for "easy" languages used by people who suffer thru needlessly difficult languages, or it can be a term for small programs either launched from the shell or embedded in a larger program
[20:58:59] <technomancy> cf Osterhaut's Fallacy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ousterhout%27s_dichotomy
[21:00:04] <technomancy> Clojure is real bad at the second one, and the first one is a nonsense categorization
[21:01:41] <tatsumaru> so according to this definition clojure doesn't exist
[21:02:14] <ridcully> yeah, we are imagining it
[21:02:20] <technomancy> this dichotomy depends heavily on the idea of an "interpreted language" which nowadays doesn't really exist; basically all languages in widespread use are compiled

[21:04:09] <technomancy> but yeah, Clojure fits 3 of the 4 criteria on this page for "systems" but it's dynamically typed and doesn't make you run an explicit "compile" step before you run the program

[21:42:14] <pl> the reason JRuby flourishes and Jython is dead is because the former has a test suite to verify compatibility with standard, and the latter needs auguries to decipher the bones of PyEval_FrameEx

[22:41:04] <ridcully> this is destructuring
