[09:23:23] <Matt|home> doesn't matter how fit i was at one point or another, starting up an exercise routine again is always a massive pain in the ass
[09:24:45] <Cryowolf> yep, but 2.2kms will become easier the more you get used to it. It'll still burn the same but unless it's uphill, you won't burn more
[09:25:22] <Matt|home> no uphills here, im in florida. flat as a pancake. i'll work my way back up to 10km daily and then focus on weight training.. diet is where i fall apart though

[09:45:54] <Sadale> isekaijin, it is xD
[09:46:00] <Sadale> isekaijin, the entire team's using mac
[09:46:18] <isekaijin> Oh, in that case it is okay.
[09:46:22] <Sadale> In the previous company I worked for, the team used linux :3
[09:46:58] <isekaijin> The problem is when everyone in your company uses Windows, except for one asshole who wants to feel like an exceptional little flower.
[09:47:59] <Cryowolf> If the software requires a certain OS to function, or for the team functions to work. Then you gotta adjust. But if not, I'd go for windows :P
[09:48:09] <isekaijin> Right.
[09:49:01] <Cryowolf> or like proprietary software requires something specific
[09:49:06] <amigojapan> isekaijin: but it would suck if it was opposite too. It also mattress what your are making
[09:49:32] <amigojapan> Some things it does not matter which OS you use
[09:50:14] <Cryowolf> most companies use Windows I think, cause of the amount of software available for it, the plugins and workflow. Inclulding creating cloud uploads and shares for projects and team functions that for example update things like a map editor in real time if multiple people work on it
[09:50:53] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: except for servers
[09:51:41] <isekaijin> Heh, reminds me of an old job where we customized software that was primarily meant to be used on Windows machines... but our database server ran Linux.
[09:52:08] <Cryowolf> I wouldnt know, but companies will typically go with what creates the best workflow and makes the work easier, gives access to more functions, software, plugins and in the end saves the company money and time
[09:52:24] <isekaijin> Yup.
[09:53:18] <amigojapan> Windows servers suck
[09:54:02] <Cryowolf> if the cloud servers run on linux and the developer machines run on windows, that's fine. But the cloud access needs to be very fast, having realtime update on a large worldmap where maybe 10+ people work on it simultaneously. Requires them to in sync and I think having the same OS helps with that
[09:54:18] <Cryowolf> the actual cloud server, or the render-server
[09:54:20] <Cryowolf> I dont know
[09:55:06] <Cryowolf> but sending things to the render-farm is faster than letting your own computer do it, so whatever works best and fastest there

[16:38:39] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: you could still use one set of input peripherals
[16:38:54] <omero> I mean... unless you are on a CASIO calculator like system... X shouldnt be that concern at all
[16:39:35] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: one reason would be cause buying several old computers would be easy cheaper than a modern one

[19:29:29] <darkwitch> it is clear coffee with clear milk? hmmmmmm
[19:29:30] <Cryowolf> but that would potentially remove some of the alcohol by changing the alkaloids when interacting with the different sugars
[19:29:41] <Cryowolf> so it's no longer ethanol

[19:37:44] <amigojapan> Bco1981: People making their own alcoholic beverages often calculate the percentage of alcohol by volume by measuring their relative density with a hydrometer or their sugar content with a refractometer. These simple instruments cleverly detect how much sugar gets converted into alcohol during the fermentation process.

[20:05:23] <Cryowolf> was in the infection ward prior to chemo they gave me 1 high-accuracy test they have to send to a lab and then cause the results hadnt come in and I needed to be sent to Lund for my chemo, they took another quick one. Then I got one more in Lund again
[20:05:57] <Cryowolf> sometimes repeat tests
[20:06:02] <Guest71> wow - does not sound fun
[20:06:19] <Cryowolf> those are the ones I can remember
[20:06:23] <Cryowolf> but Im sure there's more
[20:07:02] <Cryowolf> Guest71, it's no big deal compared to everything else I've been through
[20:07:10] <hassoon> Guest71: why
[20:07:15] <Cryowolf> it's no more than a minor 30 second inconvenience
[20:07:16] <Guest71> wow - what have you been through?
[20:08:02] <Cryowolf> cancer, removing a 26x17cm tumor at 11kgs, removing my spleen, appendix, half my stomach, third of my large intestine and third of my pancreas as well as tissue and nerves
[20:08:11] <Cryowolf> 18 weeks of chemotherapy
[20:08:19] <Guest71> wow that's crazy
[20:08:24] <hassoon> Cryowolf: ow no man
[20:08:28] <hassoon> Cryowolf: are you fine now ?
[20:08:34] <hassoon> Cryowolf: like..fine for good ?
[20:08:46] <Cryowolf> no, this particular cancers battle begins after you remove it
[20:08:53] <hassoon> :(
[20:08:55] <Cryowolf> cause if it can't be removed, you're dead
[20:09:12] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: was the worst part the chemo?
[20:09:58] <hassoon> Cryowolf: i hope you get better and get rid of this cancer for good asap
[20:09:58] <Cryowolf> I had the luck of lady fortuna to survive initially. My tumor hadn't vascularized or metastasized and MPNST tumors above 10cms do so in pretty much all cases
[20:10:10] * hassoon pets his body
[20:10:16] <hassoon> 'sup body
[20:10:19] <hassoon> stay healthy
[20:10:23] <Cryowolf> my oncologist recently told me the odds were close to a million to 1
[20:10:35] <Cryowolf> that it went this smoothly
[20:10:54] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, no the worst part was the 2 weeks post-surgery
[20:11:11] <Cryowolf> and the 3 weeks pre-surgery
[20:11:18] <amigojapan> I see Cryowolf .ouch
[20:11:41] <Guest71> someone should invent a cure for cancer
[20:11:41] <Cryowolf> 3 weeks before surgery was when I began to be unable to eat or drink much
[20:12:25] <Cryowolf> this cancer is immune to all chemo and radiation except when it's small enough to only exist as cells in the body
[20:12:33] <Cryowolf> without having formed a tumor
[20:13:16] <Cryowolf> if I survive until Jan 26, my chances of surviving to the 5 year mark goes from 50ish % up to 70%
[20:13:21] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: and they made you go thru chemo anyway?
[20:13:39] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, after surgery i had to, or my chances of surviving were 0
[20:13:49] <Cryowolf> it was to kill stray cells
[20:13:59] <Cryowolf> the tumor was gone, all of it
[20:14:02] <amigojapan> I see Cryowolf 
[20:14:18] <Cryowolf> but just one cell could start a chain reaction and it returns
[20:14:31] <amigojapan> Right
[20:15:37] <Guest71> so you might only have 1-2 years left
[20:15:38] <Cryowolf> after chemo I now have a 50% chance to survive to 5 years, it's climbing by the day and will be 70ish on Jan 26 2022, then 85ish 2023 and if I make it to the 5 year mark around 90-95%
[20:15:43] <hassoon> 10:41 < Guest71> someone should invent a cure for cancer
[20:15:46] <hassoon> YOU DO IT
[20:15:59] <Guest71> maybe i could
[20:16:07] <Cryowolf> Guest71, if I get unlucky yes
[20:16:29] <Cryowolf> but I like to think that if my body is strong enough to defeat odds 1 million to 1, me being the 1
[20:16:33] <Cryowolf> it can beat 50%
[20:16:51] <Cryowolf> and 70, and 80, and 90
[20:17:03] <Cryowolf> after 10 years it's pretty much 99%+
[20:17:46] <Cryowolf> every ct so far has shown no return, I'm also having MRI and CT+PET done soon and will have every benign tumor in my body that can be removed, removed
[20:18:02] <Cryowolf> preventative measures
[20:19:40] <Cryowolf> I also need to get navel hernia surgery and Im going on experimental medication
[20:19:57] <Cryowolf> so my near future is pretty much booked
[20:20:36] <hassoon> Cryowolf: omg man, i hope you just heal
[20:20:44] <hassoon> Cryowolf: how old are you

[20:23:44] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: what is your age now?
[20:23:51] <Cryowolf> but this is a very aggressive cancer and quite rare
[20:23:55] <Cryowolf> 36
[20:23:57] <Guest71> if you died, what would be your advice to others?
[20:24:07] <Cryowolf> advice on what?
[20:24:13] <Guest71> on life
[20:29:18] <Cryowolf> Time is a precious gift that's often squandered because we take it for granted. Many of us use it for hedonistic reasons, others self-destructive. We waste our time bickering on social media or on twitter about trivial bullshit that's useless and utterly pointless at the end of the day. This is especially true for facebook and twitter arguments about politics, creating division between people and turning friends into enemies over 
[20:29:18] <Cryowolf> nothing. So what advice do  have to give on this? Whatever is productive to your life or makes you content is not trivial, but what is wasteful and hateful is often trivial. Find balance and stop living through your smartphone and likes from strangers who don't give two shits about you. Find friends who do, online or IRL don't matter.
[20:29:48] <Cryowolf> Also...if you notice something is wrong, go see a fucking doctor
[20:30:16] <Guest71> solid advice
[20:30:18] <Guest71> thank you
[20:32:30] <Cryowolf> It's pretty general advice though, but another one is that if you do get cancer. Don't die before you're dead. I say that what I mean is, don't let yourself drop into depression on the deepest end where your mind is basically not participating in life anymore and you're dead, before you die
[20:34:31] <Cryowolf> Cancer makes you feel powerless, extremely so. Whatever you have power over no matter how small. It could be as little as what to eat for dinner. The more you control in life, in your life. The better you'll feel in the face of being powerless
[20:35:02] <Guest71> i see
[20:35:02] <Cryowolf> it's psychological and it will help you keep your strength up

[20:43:09] <Cryowolf> So here's another piece of advice to the modern lifestyle. There's a person at the other end of your keyboard and it's easy to forget since all you see is a name on a screen with some text. It's easy to get carried away and say things you would never say to someone in person and in doing so you might actually be hurting them a lot more than they would admit. It's a cycle of callous behavior I often see on social media
[20:43:31] <Guest71> very true
[20:43:58] <Cryowolf> with the excuse "maybe you shouldn't be here if you're so easily hurt", which can so easily be flipped around to "maybe you shouldn't be here if you're such an asshole"
[20:45:47] <Cryowolf> I'm guilty of treating people like trash and I've hurt them. I'm not proud of it. I might end up getting carried away again. But you also can't control what offends somebody, so counter to what I've just said. Don't censor your opinions, but perhaps be decent to others while expressing them

[20:52:58] <Cryowolf> I don't censor myself, I refuse to be thought-policed or told I have to think or feel a certain way. I'm a fairly liberal minded individual, I believe in equal opportunity and that we don't discriminate based on characteristics you were born with. If the choices you made in life took you to where you are, you gotta own that and that is something I might discriminate based on...but things like skin color, sexuality etc?  Never. But 
[20:52:58] <Cryowolf> still some people believe it's not enogh for me to believe what I do. I have to change to suit them and that's not something I'm gonna do. So if that hurts them, I'm fine with that
[20:54:08] <Guest71> i see
[20:55:31] <darkwitch> it hurts a little to be told that I must watch dragon ball
[20:55:54] <Cryowolf> darkwitch, or play Dark Souls
[20:56:01] <Cryowolf> but I must endure
[20:56:18] <Sapphirus> what spurred this rant
[20:56:43] <Cryowolf> Sapphirus, not so much a rant as I was asked to give advice
[20:57:04] <Cryowolf> touched upon some topics to give context to my advice
[20:57:15] <Cryowolf> and that's it
[20:59:38] <Sapphirus> I see.
[21:00:27] <Cryowolf> but I've only lived 36 years and in the past almost 10 months I've gone through more growth than I have in the past 10 years
[21:01:59] <Sapphirus> Brought some tears to my eyes reading all of your commentary just now. Some of it hit the feels.
[21:03:19] <Cryowolf> Thank you. I think
[21:06:43] <Cryowolf> During the course of my cancer I don't want to be pitied, only understood
[21:08:19] <Sapphirus> Understood well and clear. Part about depression particularly hit me as I know exactly what that is you describe.
[21:08:49] <Cryowolf> I've been on both sides of this rotten withering disease. I watched my die wither away from what I thought was an immortal man, to a fragile husk of who he used to be because of lung cancer. I know what it's like to watch someone you love go through it because I've gone through it. Now I'm going through the other part and I know exactly how others are feeling
[21:09:54] <Cryowolf> Sapphirus, yeah it's a state all too familiar to me but it wasn't until I got cancer that I realized just how important it is I don't let myself die before I'm dead
[21:10:21] <Cryowolf> even if only by a little, I can slowly get ut of the depression
[21:10:32] <Cryowolf> out*
[21:10:55] <Cryowolf> sometimes with support, sometimes without. Afterall it's the person with depression that has to decide that

[21:13:34] <Sapphirus> Self-care is very important. Dealing with a family member right now going through tribulations and what not, and I've been through my own depression.
[21:15:36] <Cryowolf> Depressions are tricky to deal with and often invisible to everyone but you and sometimes even to you
[21:16:15] <Sapphirus> It can make the difference between falling all the way down and keeping yourself above water.

[21:17:21] <Sapphirus> It would've been easy to let go and let everything fall into disarray. 
[21:17:58] <Sapphirus> By not doing that, you soften the blow, as much energy as it may require to do that.
[21:18:19] <Cryowolf> I did that a few times earlier in life, let go
[21:18:27] <Cryowolf> but now I let go in a different way
[21:18:56] <Sapphirus> It's okay to let go in some ways, so as long as you don't slip beneath the water.
[21:19:04] <Macer> brand new cherry flavor was pretty decent
[21:19:11] <Macer> i thought it was going to be worse than it was
[21:19:11] <Cryowolf> I know it's largely chemical, it's not a byproduct of events but rather my brain being wired this way. I know with medicine it's only a matter of time before it begins to work and reduces the symptoms
[21:19:24] <Cryowolf> so I "let go" of the worries surrounding my depression
[21:19:39] <Cryowolf> I accept that I have it and I know it will improve
[21:20:13] <Sapphirus> There's nothing unnatural about depression in a shitty life circumstance, either.
[21:20:52] <Sapphirus> Imho it's only a chemical problem, so to speak, when you've got everything going for you and you're still depressed.
[21:21:06] <Cryowolf> nope but I can enter depression regardless of what, who, where, when etc
[21:21:25] <Sapphirus> Yeah, that isn't good, either.
[21:21:32] <Cryowolf> so I just get my psych to prescribe me mediciine 
[21:21:44] <Cryowolf> and then its just about waiting for it to kick in (takes 4-5 weeks)

[21:44:00] <Guest71> they suck man
[21:44:03] <isekaijin> And it is no coincidence.
[21:44:42] <Sapphirus> Yeah, I modded 8.1 to be tolerable back years ago, but it was to buy time so I could transition over to Linux.
[21:44:55] <Guest71> Linux Mint?
[21:45:36] <Sapphirus> Writing was on the wall in 2011-2012 and that's when I began finding open source replacements for software that I used.
[21:45:43] <Sapphirus> Then I eventually was able to switch without having to look back.
[21:45:45] <isekaijin> Ah, I learnt how to use Linux the painful way. No transitioning or anything. Just three months of not even knowing how to connect my computer to the Internet.

[21:46:43] <Sapphirus> I already had experience with the Linux Desktop, at that point, and was doing a bit of distro hopping and some back/forth between Windows.
[21:46:51] <isekaijin> Oh.
[21:47:01] <isekaijin> What other distros did you try?
[21:47:26] <Sapphirus> On Debian for a little while there, and used Linux Mint.
[21:47:43] <Bco1981> isn't mint based on debian ?
[21:47:45] <Sapphirus> Eventually settled on Arch and stayed put for good between 2015-2016.
[21:47:50] <Cryowolf> whats the OS called that launches a new virtual machine for each new action you take?
[21:47:52] <Cryowolf> Q something
[21:48:23] <isekaijin> Qubes?
[21:48:28] <Cryowolf> probably yes
[21:48:35] <Sapphirus> You can do that without Qubes, too.
[21:48:38] <isekaijin> Should definitely try that one.
[21:48:43] <Guest71> it's called sandboxing
[21:48:46] <Sapphirus> ^
[21:48:47] <Guest71> with FireJail or Apparmor
[21:49:02] <Guest71> Qubes requires too much RAM and sacrifices UX
[21:49:02] <Cryowolf> Sapphirus, can you do it plug and play without any effort other than hitting the install button?
[21:49:02] <Bco1981> get OS Pubes for when you have to visit pornhub.
[21:49:14] <Sapphirus> Crywolf, Linux Mint you can.
[21:49:26] <Sapphirus> Debian not so much, and Arch not really.

[21:50:30] <Sapphirus> Probably the most beginner friendly out there. You could go the manjaro route if you are confident enough.
[21:50:51] <Sapphirus> I'm already quite technical of a user so I hopped straight from Mint/Debian to Arch.
[21:50:58] <Cryowolf> I pretty much want something as easy or easier than windows 10

[21:51:36] <Bco1981> then it has to be on the same level as easy as windows.
[21:51:37] <Sapphirus> Be between POP! OS, Ubuntu and Linux Mint, and maybe Manjaro. 
[21:51:41] <Bco1981> notice... "same level"
[21:52:03] <Sapphirus> Although there are things that are obviously going to be different.
[21:52:16] <Sapphirus> You have to be open to a paradigm change.
[21:52:46] <Cryowolf> depends how radical that change is and how desperately I want linux
[21:52:51] <Cryowolf> which is nearing a 0
[21:53:19] <Bco1981> Cryowolf: i'd say Manjaro is getting there. with nice steam support.
[21:53:20] <isekaijin> Cryowolf: It is probably best to try a live USB first, as you said.
[21:53:24] <Cryowolf> I'm curious sometimes about trying out new things but then get back to my games on windows
[21:53:27] <Bco1981> and i have OBS on it too

[21:56:32] <Sapphirus> windows games run on linux just fine nowadays
[21:56:36] <Sapphirus> except drm infused ones
[21:56:41] <Bco1981> "many of them"
[21:56:44] <Bco1981> not all
[21:57:10] <Cryowolf> Sapphirus, not day 0, not instantly patched, not with latest graphical drivers working perfectly in sync with the game
[21:57:10] <Sapphirus> just the ones with kernel-level drm bordering spyware
[21:57:32] <Cryowolf> not as well or stable as windows counter part
[21:57:57] <Sapphirus> Funny thing is I've never had my nvidia driver explicitly crash because I was playing a game on Linux.
[21:58:02] <Sapphirus> Wherea on Windows, it'd be a frequent occurance.

[21:58:39] <Sapphirus> Doesn't seem to be a problem for everyone, but I know I'm far from the only one.
[21:58:52] <Sapphirus> I think it might come down to game-specific optimisations.
[21:58:56] <Cryowolf> Linux is far from a gaming operating system
[21:59:01] <Bco1981> something else is wrong with the system
[21:59:03] <Cryowolf> theyre simply not optimized for it
[21:59:13] <Cryowolf> it's a great OS for a lot of things
[21:59:21] <Sapphirus> Nah, as the same games run through Steam & Proton on Linux don't crash anything.
[21:59:24] <Cryowolf> but for gaming, nothing beats out Windows for PC
[21:59:29] <Bco1981> if linux really wanted to make it big, then would focus on getting the gamers.
[21:59:37] <Sapphirus> Something fucky going on with Nvidia's drivers on Windows causing them to crash.

[22:00:45] <Sapphirus> Practically the windows versions of the games running through a compatibility layer.
[22:00:51] <Bco1981> hardware failure, because the windows driver actaully uses all the tricks on your gpu. load it up in linux and there is no problem. because it does not utilize the gpu for all it's features.

[22:01:12] <Cryowolf> Sapphirus, but such emulations aren't as good as the real thing
[22:01:13] <Sapphirus> Very few native releases in contrast.
[22:01:34] <Cryowolf> I can't find a single reason to switch to Linux
[22:01:35] <Sapphirus> Crywolf, nah. With GTA V, for example, I can't even tell that it's not on Windows.
[22:01:47] <Sapphirus> DirectX 11 has been replicated solidly.
[22:01:48] <Cryowolf> GTA V has been out for a decade
[22:01:55] <Sapphirus> Newer games also work.
[22:02:04] <Sapphirus> DX11 library is pretty much feature complete at this point.
[22:02:34] <Sapphirus> Only things that would cause hiccups would be Win32 APIs not implemented or low-level DRM.
[22:04:09] <Cryowolf> but I've yet to hear an argument for switching to Linux :P
[22:04:33] <Sapphirus> It all depends on what you as a user want.
[22:05:23] <Sapphirus> I'm quite technically-inclined and I don't want to not be able to do with the software on my system as I please.

[22:06:53] <ImoutoBot> [text/html] 16kB
[22:07:06] <Cryowolf> yes but why when I already do it all
[22:07:26] <Sapphirus> Whether or not Windows gets in the way is probably more of a deciding factor.
[22:07:44] <Cryowolf> it hasn't so far
[22:08:02] <Cryowolf> works great for my adobe ventures too
[22:08:05] <Sapphirus> For me personally, WIndows got in my way and I began hating the act of using my computer.
[22:08:12] <Cryowolf> and game pass for pc
[22:08:53] <Sapphirus> I'm never looking back. No forced updates, my system respects me the user, and I don't need to worry about Microsoft anymore, most importantly of all.
[22:09:17] <Sapphirus> Most of my steam library works and there's a few games that even have native binaries.
[22:09:26] <Cryowolf> youll still get shadow profiles of you
[22:09:59] <Sapphirus> That's not really a worry of mine. 
[22:10:22] <Cryowolf> I can postpone my updates in Windows Home indefinitely
[22:10:31] <Cryowolf> even security ones
[22:10:52] <Cryowolf> you didnt used to be able to do that
[22:10:56] <Cryowolf> but they changed it
[22:11:09] <Cryowolf> same with privacy stuff. You can now opt out of everything pretty much
[22:11:33] <Cryowolf> and thanks to GDPR I can demand all info they have on me and to have it purged
[22:11:48] <Sapphirus> Yeah, that's if you believe those options actually do anything substantive.
[22:12:07] <Sapphirus> I suspect you've never actually used wireshark on an external system to see if it's not actually phoning home everything still.
[22:12:15] <Sapphirus> Pretty much can only be done in Windows 7.
[22:12:25] <Cryowolf> I don't use wireshark
[22:12:35] <Cryowolf> but I have a process monitor running
[22:12:39] <Sapphirus> You're just placing faith into those options actually doing anything.
[22:13:23] <Sapphirus> Microsoft has gone to large extents to prevent you from being able to shutdown the OS from phoning anything home.
[22:13:26] <Cryowolf> well then so be it...but if Linux wants to be competitive they need to step up their casual user game substantially more
[22:13:40] <Sapphirus> It's clear how ineffectual those options are if you externally monitor network traffic on your machine.
[22:14:10] <Sapphirus> Last version of Windows that can be sealed tight is 7.
[22:14:53] <Cryowolf> I still have the ability to use GDPR
[22:15:19] <Cryowolf> very expensive for microsoft to refuse to comply, or hide info
[22:15:40] <Sapphirus> GDPR is pure lip service and you'd have to see if your voice mattered more to the EU than Microsoft's lobbyists.
[22:16:12] <Sapphirus> They definitely don't care about your privacy. Otherwise, it wouldn't be so difficult to stop Windows 10 from phoning home.
[22:16:13] <Cryowolf> since its legally enforcible by lawyers paid for by the EU
[22:16:28] <Cryowolf> I expect they care enough
[22:16:33] <isekaijin> Sapphirus: Well, let's be honest, I do not think all Windows games run smoothly on Linux.
[22:16:44] <isekaijin> It is sad, but Windows is still the better desktop gaming platform.
[22:16:56] <Cryowolf> and I can use third party software to block windows
[22:16:57] <Sapphirus> isekaijin, that is true.
[22:17:02] <Cryowolf> from doing things
[22:17:03] <Sapphirus> Although it's been getting better.
[22:17:23] <Sapphirus> Rate at which things are improving over the last few years is far more than what I saw the prior part of the decade.
[22:18:01] <Sxem> i think i will barely touch intellivision and vic 20 and atari 5200 and skip ahead to colecovision. i have trauma from playing the 2600 games. i need better graphics...
[22:18:02] <Cryowolf> if Linux is gonna have any chance on the market as a viable OS, they need to be very very very easily accessible for the casual user that refers to the internet as google
[22:18:46] <Sapphirus> ChromeOS demonstrates that Linux is already there for those people. If all you do is open a browser, and you don't intend on doing anything more, you really don't need Windows anymore.
[22:18:56] <isekaijin> Sapphirus: Although I would not play games not written in English, or localized to English, I have a friend who wants to play a (badly written, trademark-violating, generally sucky) game written in my mother tongue. We could not get it to run on Wine.
[22:19:01] <Sapphirus> You could get away with an Android tablet for that matter.
[22:19:41] <Sapphirus> isekaijin, I wonder if it's locale-related rather than Win32-related.
[22:20:01] <Sapphirus> Very possible that some esoteric Win32 routines are being utilised by the devs
[22:20:01] <isekaijin> Strangely enough for a game, it has the .NET framework as dependency.
[22:20:10] <isekaijin> A very recent version.
[22:20:11] <Cryowolf> Sapphirus, I still have my doubts I could do every tiny little thing as easily and on the spot. Like new game patches working the second theyre out
[22:20:20] <Cryowolf> or new hardware
[22:20:36] <isekaijin> Cryowolf: Indeed, new hardware is always an issue.
[22:20:37] <Sapphirus> Usually that's the case with games that work reliably already in Proton.
[22:20:50] <Sapphirus> New hardware can be a sore spot.
[22:21:01] <isekaijin> Windows usually gets earlier and better support for new hardware.
[22:21:14] <Sapphirus> For me personally, as a more technical user, I've been fine without Windows for the last 5+ years.
[22:21:20] <Sapphirus> And I don't miss it.
[22:21:23] <Cryowolf> so Im still not hearing a reason to switch
[22:21:46] <Cryowolf> I'm not a technical user. I used to be, but I sort of abandoned it cause I lost interest
[22:22:03] <Cryowolf> I built my m0n0wall back in the day
[22:22:07] <Sapphirus> That's totally fine. Like I said, the motivation really comes down to what you want out of your computer.
[22:22:31] <Sapphirus> Linux likely will never be mainstream and that's okay. It's still a viable option for those of us who don't want to be beholden to Microsoft anymore.
