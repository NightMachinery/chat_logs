[02:18:39] <earnest> overl: If you are using uefi I'd suggest --removable, which creates generic bootx64.efi files under efi/boot.  These are default targets all uefi implementations look for
[02:19:05] *** Joins: interweb (~interweb@user/interweb)
[02:19:06] <earnest> This obviates creating uefi entries, ids etc.  Unless you have a reason to keep grub as a distinct efi file that is
[02:19:28] <Khorne> jab416171, why are you expecting a GRUB entry in the efi variables when you specifically set it to i386-pc ie BIOS mode
[02:19:36] <interweb> Hi, how can I add a minimum fan speed to keep my nvidia cooler?
[02:19:41] <jab416171> earnest, I'm using uefi and raid, should I still be using x86_64-efi? when I run it efibootmgr says it requires an argument -d

[02:19:48] <jab416171> I'll try with --removable and see if that does anything

[02:20:25] <earnest> jab416171: Yeah, because -efi is for uefi.  I'm not sure why raid would influence that
[02:20:52] <earnest> The boot device has to be accessible to the uefi system somehow, underwhich the file structure is standard

[02:23:37] <Khorne> jab416171, alright :)
[02:23:45] <interweb> earnest, but if I somehow turn a minimum fan speed it would last longer?

[17:37:43] <nl6720> lts still has xz compressed modules, that's one factor for the difference between their sizes

[19:19:11] <getynge> I'm seeing a strange issue that I only see on my laptop (my laptop and desktop have identical system configs aside from drivers)  In firefox I see graphical artifacts on menu items and really any interactive elements rendered within firefox.  The only thing different between my two systems is that my laptop has intel HD graphics and an nvidia gpu with prime switching.  The issue occurs with prime disabled or enabled but does NOT occur while 
[19:19:11] <getynge> recording the screen.  I can get a recording with my phones camera to show what the artifacts are

[20:45:12] <getynge> If I want a welcome message to show up on all interactive zsh shells is adding it to my .zshrc the best method or is there a better way? I currently have a welcome message in my zshrc but I'm wondering if that's actually the best way.  For reference it's a command so I can't use the motd files
[20:45:30] <jkc> rcf: May not work for this use case. Camera has to be connected to the computer for proctored testing.
[20:45:43] <getynge> I googled it and zshrc looks like the best way but google has misguided me in the past, hence my asking here
