[23:23:24] <constxd_> hence why i want to pay someone to fix it for me lol
[23:23:35] <rb> i've kept any multithreaded operations in the "future things" category simply because multithreaded GC is scary
[23:23:51] <constxd_> yeah that was me for a long time
[23:23:51] <rb> i have a model of how i want to do it, but it's definitely finnicky
[23:24:02] <technomancy> constxd_: what's the language, ooc

[23:25:29] <companion_cube> is refcounting an option for you, constxd_?
[23:25:38] <companion_cube> it's a lot more achievable with multiple threads
[23:25:47] <rb> banna: i'm going for actor model
[23:25:51] <technomancy> constxd_: I approve of having the very first thing you see in the language be pattern matching; +1
[23:26:13] <constxd_> :)
[23:26:40] <banna> rb: nice. I'm sure implementing it will teach many lessons
[23:26:46] <constxd_> companion_cube: idk, maybe. i think that would require a lot of changes to the codebase but i guess ultimately it may be easier
[23:26:48] <rb> basically globally reachable objects are locked for write, objects and slots reachable to the actor are free to modify, actors communicate with messages, objects are deep copied in messages
[23:27:02] <companion_cube> +1 for pattern matching
[23:27:05] <rb> (last part is probably optimizable, but i think deep copy is good for a first draft)
[23:27:39] <technomancy> constxd_: it's pretty bold for a toy just-getting-started language to attack a problem for which only ~5 solutions exist world-wide
[23:27:40] <rb> pattern matching is overrated :^)))))))))))) *leaves*

[23:28:35] <banna> good language features for multithreaded runtime debug is best
[23:28:47] <banna> as everyone will do dumb stuff with threads
[23:30:05] <constxd_> yeah maybe i'd better give up on this idea lol
[23:30:32] <technomancy> constxd_: I mean it's definitely a beefy challenge if you're into that
[23:30:43] <technomancy> just seems like your language probably has bigger problems at this stage?
[23:30:58] <constxd_> how do you mean?

[23:31:41] <JordiGH> Working on an icosahedral Rubik's. Can't tell yet if this is easy or hard.
[23:31:47] <companion_cube> OCaml is getting multicore GC this year, after >25 years of existence
[23:31:52] <companion_cube> it's just like crazy hard
[23:31:53] <technomancy> how can you get to the stage where GC pauses are a problem if you don't even have like ... libraries to get things done
[23:32:04] <river> how is it even done
[23:32:08] <river> i want to know
[23:32:09] <JordiGH> Sure, the group is larger. But also more generators and each group action touches fewer elements of the underlying set.
[23:32:16] <river> i dont know how to normal threaded programming
[23:32:18] <river> let alone a gc

[23:33:01] <technomancy> constxd_: lol nice
[23:33:03] <JordiGH> lol
[23:33:15] <banna> technomancy: oh entirely possible to get a baby lang to barf on its own stuff
[23:33:22] <JordiGH> I brute forced a slow solution for the standard cube by looking at commutators.
[23:33:26] <technomancy> constxd_: is it self-hosted yet?
[23:33:35] <technomancy> JordiGH: whoa damn
[23:33:46] <constxd_> no not yet that's on the backburner
[23:34:13] <constxd_> the C version of the compiler would be faster anyway so i don't see a huge reason to port it
[23:34:21] <iDrougge> JordiGH: Usually you change keyboard layout by pressing ^space, caps lock or Fn.
[23:34:23] <constxd_> could be fun though
[23:34:26] <technomancy> constxd_: I guess my perspective is different since I work on a compiler which doesn't have its own runtime but self-hosting has been a huge win for us
[23:34:44] <technomancy> oh god your compiler is C?
[23:34:45] <banna> technomancy: for my own toy lang, I created tests that create a ton of "fluff" for memory management purposes, and make sure all the memory is accounted for
