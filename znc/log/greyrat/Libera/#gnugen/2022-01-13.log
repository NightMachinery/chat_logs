[01:39:59] <Orbstheorem> Ugh, I have a class called "Gestion d'entreprise" and one of the final parts of the project is to make a video to convince investors about your product.
[01:40:23] <Orbstheorem> > Ã‰laborer une vidÃ©o prÃ©sentant votre projet, selon les contraintes Ã©noncÃ©es dans la partie le but. La vidÃ©o doit durer au moins 5Â minutes et tous les Ã©lÃ¨ves participants Ã  la rÃ©daction du dossier doivent sâ€™adresse face Ã  la camÃ©ra, ou en voix off, pour des durÃ©es Ã©quivalentes. Le fichier capsule vidÃ©o vous fournira une idÃ©e des points principaux qui se doivent dâ€™Ãªtre abordÃ©s.
[01:40:54] <Orbstheorem> I guess that's the very least I can do for "et gestion" part of my school.
[01:41:17] <Orbstheorem> I'm fine with the video and the recording.
[01:42:18] <Orbstheorem> I'm just troubled by the part:
[01:42:18] <Orbstheorem> > [dÃ©marrer votre startup] nâ€™est pas suffisant, il vous faut plus de capitaux, lâ€™autre moitiÃ©. Pour ce faire, vous allez avoir besoin dâ€™investisseurs. Vous pensez avoir trouvÃ© la perle rare, mais il faut encore la convaincre.
[01:44:28] <Orbstheorem> Pfff
[01:44:28] <Orbstheorem> My "convincings" usually involve mathematical proofs, but maths are not particularly fit to model societies...
[01:56:59] <afontain[m]> yup
[01:58:17] <afontain[m]> la partie "persuader que vous avez un projet intÃ©ressant, mais surtout sans trop parler su projet en dÃ©tail", j'ai quand-mÃªme du mal
[11:49:27] <afontain[m]> haha wtf https://old.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/s2u7eg/is_firefox_down/
[12:41:02] <LucasCrijns[m]> I just had the same problem with Firefox. The fix in the thread worked for me
[14:07:03] <Notkea> il se passe quoi ?
[14:12:26] <GermainZ> Orbstheorem: you shouldn't need proofs to convince people a project is interesting (as in, explain why it is useful), only to prove that it is useful
[14:12:40] *** Joins: Skeetis[m] (~widmergnu@2001:470:69fc:105::f26)
[14:12:51] <GermainZ> For an elevator pitch you definitely don't want to explain any of the proofs
[14:12:54] *** Joins: Eurydice[m]1 (~adonnetgn@2001:470:69fc:105::1:68a)
[14:13:14] <GermainZ> But rather why you're proving something in the first place and what that can lead to
[14:14:28] <Orbstheorem> GermainZ: ?
[14:14:49] <Orbstheorem> <Notkea> "> <@pacien:pacien.net> there's..." <- Tiens, j'ai ratÃ© ce message x)
[14:15:42] <Orbstheorem> Yes, there are language pragmas, but even then you have the same problem: What pragmas should I use? Should I use `AllowAmbiguousTypes` + type applications or a phantom type captured in a `Proxy`?
[14:18:07] <Orbstheorem> Should I use `ViewPatterns` and `PatternSynonyms`?
[14:18:26] <Orbstheorem> And I guess the problem is that there's no good answer for these questions.
[14:19:13] <Orbstheorem> If haskell were a production-focused language, it would be irresponsible for them to discharge so many language segmentation issues (cough C++).
[14:19:51] <Orbstheorem> But it's not, it's a research language, anything is fine for as long as it's actually useful is some situation...
[14:19:53] <Notkea> <Orbstheorem> "My "convincings" usually involve..." <- maybe they felt it would be too awkward to write "seduce"
[14:21:13] <Orbstheorem> What? xD
[14:22:27] <Notkea> pretty sure this is actually the fitting termâ€¦ At least in French
[14:22:39] <Orbstheorem> What would that be in french?
[14:22:54] <Notkea> Â« sÃ©duire les consommateurs Â», Â« sÃ©duire les investisseurs Â»
[14:23:04] <Orbstheorem> Hahaha x)
[14:23:08] <Orbstheorem> Yes, it fits
[15:13:14] <GermainZ> Orbstheorem: your rant about "convincings"
[15:13:33] <Orbstheorem> <afontain[m]> "la partie "persuader que vous..." <- Mainly this part.
[15:13:38] <GermainZ> Unless the bridge is mixing up usernames 
[15:54:03] <Notkea> I'm not sure of how the quote-replies are bridged. Are those just translated as mentions? Or maybe shortened quotes?
[16:21:43] <afontain[m]> forward on firefox: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1749908#c21
[16:25:02] <afontain[m]> quoting: Â« Our current suspicion is that a cloud provider or load balancer that fronts one of our own servers got an update that triggers an existing HTTP3 bug. Â»
[16:25:42] <afontain[m]> that would suggest google cloud platform, cloudflare or similar broke like half the web for hours ?
[16:26:26] <afontain[m]> (for Firefox only though)
[16:41:44] <GermainZ> Notkea: shortened quotes
[16:53:01] <CedricHlzl[t][m]> <afontain[m]> "forward on firefox: https://..." <- imagine already being at http3 while some website still dont use http2 :(
[16:54:29] <afontain[m]> like gnugen.ch ;P
[17:20:24] <Orbstheorem> I've never wrote an HTTP2 application.

[21:46:52] <Orbstheorem> Wtf...
[21:47:03] <Orbstheorem> So, above is the old code, bellow is the new one.
[21:47:18] <Orbstheorem> Can somebody explain to me `findUserCredentialByPassword`?..
[21:48:00] <Orbstheorem> (Yes, at some point I will throw away `BeanUtils.copyProperties...`, I just want to modify one thing at a time.
[21:48:03] <Orbstheorem> * a time.)
[21:48:18] <Orbstheorem> Please, seriously though... All users will have different passwords...
[21:48:25] <Orbstheorem> Right? Right?...
[22:03:31] <artectrex[m]> "this password is already in use, please use another password"
[22:05:29] <typedef[m]1> <Orbstheorem> "image.png" <- Spring?

[22:15:43] <Orbstheorem> Yes...
[22:15:43] <Orbstheorem> typedef[m]1: I mean, to be completely honest, I don't think nothing is as complete and easy to use for newcomers as spring-boot in java these days. And probably the only reason why you would use java nowdays is because you need to hire people...
