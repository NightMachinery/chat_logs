[03:31:15] <muaddib[m]> Oh yes, the only true on-call careers in the world!
[03:32:20] <muaddib[m]> Have you done a blog post or write up on decoding these? As far as SDR is concerned, this is one of the first things people started decoding back in the day. But I think a lot of those projects have fallen to the wayside. Would be interesting to see how you’re doing it today.

[05:06:20] <catphish> you're probably right, i see lots of wideband data in the 900MHz+ band, also FM and DAB broadcast radio

[05:29:22] <catphish> in fact i wonder if the FPGA in my N200 could do that, but a server would still be cool, as multiple people could use it concurrently

[05:45:05] <muaddib[m]> That’s a complex setup, but yes. I have 3 projects. That are geared towards that application.
[05:45:52] <muaddib[m]> Id steer clear of the fpga piece, but you could use your N200 and a small computer. Probly an rpi would work
[05:46:24] <patchvonbraun[m]> catphish: The FPGA in the N200 is not terribly capacious.  
[05:47:09] <muaddib[m]> I don’t know what capacious is but based on your track record,  I’ll agree.

[05:54:08] <subspace1486[m]> Bjoern Kerler: thanks for that GRC, I think it's helpful! I do like your idea of the 1-in-N block, but I think that's only going to work if I can figure out a way to extract samples starting from the a tag that has a value over 8500 or some other high value. I'm just not sure how to identify this tag or how to take action from it. Certainly a simple decimation makes sense. Should I set this filter in a custom Python block?
[05:55:11] <subspace1486[m]> Also this is starting to look a little crazy

[06:05:08] <catphish> thanks
[06:05:44] <muaddib[m]> Since the Stillsuit/Arrakis combo requires GNURadio on both ends, I also hacked apart someone else's web-based waterfall/FFT web server to accept a ZMQ stream. I hope to integrate it with these other 2 projects soon to replace the need for Guild Navigator ( where local GNURadio install is required).
[06:05:44] <muaddib[m]> https://github.com/muaddib1984/gr-webspectrum
[06:06:16] <catphish> gnuradio on both ends makes sense to me
[06:06:39] <muaddib[m]> well, you said you wanted to offer other people to connect, so they also have to have GNURadio
[06:07:06] <catphish> that's true, not something i'm focusing on initially either way
[06:07:36] <muaddib[m]> right, me either. i just want to monitor my own remote station 
[06:08:03] <catphish> the reason i want this right now is that i'm planning to hook my N200 to an HF antenna, since it has no HF tuner, it'll need to receive at 30Msps, but i'd like to be able to use it remotely over wifi / internet
[06:08:18] <catphish> so i want a proxy that does the tuning in software
[06:09:38] <catphish> now i may cheat and use a ham-it-up, but don't really love having all the pointless extra conversions
[06:10:11] <muaddib[m]> I have a ham-it-up somewhere, used it a couple times. seems ok.
[06:10:32] <muaddib[m]> there's many ways to do what you're asking about. this is just the way I came up with doing it.
[06:10:36] <catphish> i also now have one (arrived today), will try it both ways
[06:10:44] <catphish> thanks, i'll take a look
[06:11:24] <catphish> time to sleep now!
[06:11:29] <muaddib[m]> no problem. I mean, it can display 20MHz of spectrum at 8 vectors per second over a 1Mbps link, which is what i was shooting ofr
[06:11:31] <muaddib[m]> s/ofr/for/
[06:12:35] <catphish> i'm less interested in the full sprectrum as i am in transmitting a full 1MHz "slice"
[06:13:31] <catphish> ie mix, filter, and decimate to get (for example) 14-15MHz only
[06:13:52] <catphish> (or whatever the correct procedure is to tune to a specific slice)
[06:13:55] <muaddib[m]> gotcha. will need modification to TX, but not too difficult. feel free to hit me up with questions. It's also covered in this tutorial.
[06:13:55] <muaddib[m]> https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php?title=Understanding_XMLRPC_Blocks
[06:14:27] <catphish> oh you can change parameters by XMLRPC, that's very cool
[06:14:36] <catphish> will def read that
[06:17:15] <muaddib[m]> yea, it's a feature not many people know about so I made that tutorial
[06:25:37] <patchvonbraun[m]> Apropos of nothing in particular.  There's an archivist at the NATO headquarters in Brussels who is going to try to find us some documentation on our satellite dish system.  The control system had a standard AN designator--AN/FSQ-173, and there should be documents for it, and they likely aren't classified (at least the fairly mundane things we're interested in).

[06:33:05] <flash[m]> sounds boring...
[06:33:50] <patchvonbraun[m]> Yeah.  Bit like a librarian, only it's not just books.  Documents, photographs, etc, etc.  If you're into it, you're really into it.   
[06:34:52] <patchvonbraun[m]> I remember delving into the "stacks" at Carleton U. many many many years ago to find an article in an old physics periodical from the very first interferometry experiments done by Roger Jennison.  That prompted me to contact him, and we had a nice discussion.  He died about a year later :( :(
[06:36:12] <patchvonbraun[m]> I have a good friend who helps run the computer history museum in California.  This is the kind of thing that turns his crank.  And there are those guys restoring the LEM comms system from the Apollo program.  You just know they've developed a good relationship with the NASA librarians and archivists.
[06:37:13] <patchvonbraun[m]> HUGE chunks of technology and engineering historical information ARE NOT on-line.  It's sometimes really important to understand where we've already been.
[06:40:42] <patchvonbraun[m]> My father was a Museums guy, so, he knew a lot of archives people.  Not a field I pursued myself, but I totally understand the draw.

[21:35:41] <subspace1486[m]> If the Correlation Estimator block adds a bunch of tags to the samples, is there a series of blocks or other methods of finding the sample containing the tag with the highest value? Certainly I'd expect the estimate to slowly grow, peak when the preamble matches, and then degrade. Is there a technique for finding this tag, or is a custom Python block my best bet?

[21:42:28] <abanz[m]> Hello,
[21:42:28] <abanz[m]> I am trying to gain the capability to record and save IQ data in SigMF format in GNU Radio Companion with the use of the gr-sigmf package. Can someone please provide some insight to the question/error posted here:

[21:58:29] <subspace1486[m]> Also, does anyone know how to configure Correlation Estimator to only tag the stream if the correlation is above 6000 or some other number? I don't understand the setting when the block's method is set to Absolute.

[22:35:13] <subspace1486[m]> I'll take a look!
[22:37:17] <subspace1486[m]> Right now I'm very tempted to go for three custom python blocks: 1) find the tag where the corr_est value is the highest, and remove all other tags, 2) downsample at the baud rate starting from that tag, and 3) translate those samples from a float into 0, 1, or -, which represents a lack of a signal
