[09:27:29] <lapion> Well at least it creates the new profile puts it under the same name as the previous profile

[16:00:41] <Cork> i often get estimated buffer time of 2-6h to play a 30 min clip
[16:01:20] <Cork> and that is in c code so not browser related at all

[22:18:14] <CaCode> how can I contribute to lockwise?
[22:19:04] <mefistofeles> CaCode: I guess https://github.com/mozilla-lockwise 
[22:19:15] <CaCode> thank you
[22:19:50] <CaCode> mefistofeles: do you know why Lockwise seems to generate relatively insecure passwords? without the use of special chars and numbers?
[22:20:01] <mefistofeles> I don't, sorry
[22:20:03] <mefistofeles> I don't use it
[22:20:07] <CaCode> thanks
[22:20:44] <mefistofeles> that said, I don't see like a general lockwise repo there, only the android or ios. I guess the other one is built into firefox itself?
[22:21:59] <nemo> CaCode: how are those insecure?
[22:22:07] <nemo> security is about bits of entropy
[22:22:16] <nemo> xkcdpass uses only words. is that insecure?
[22:22:57] <CaCode> nemo if they were made out of equal parts of special chars, letters, capitalized letters and numbers they would be much more secure
[22:23:01] <nemo> false
[22:23:05] <nemo> just generated a password on a random site.  It appears mozilla's default generator uses uppercase, lowercase and numbers
[22:23:33] <CaCode> what about special chars?
[22:24:11] <nemo> that is 26*2+10 or 62 values.  It has a length of 15.  That is 62¹⁵ which is 7.7*10²⁶ combinations
[22:24:54] <nemo> CaCode: it does not help. in fact, NIST now recommends *against* such practices
[22:25:27] <nemo> CaCode: so. consider what firefox is trying to do. They are trying to randomly generate a password that will work on most sites and that people can easily distinguish if they want to type it back out from the password manager
[22:25:34] <nemo> for that purpose number of permutations is the only useful measure
[22:25:43] <nemo> special characters increase likelihood of both user failure and site failure
[22:25:57] *** Hash is now known as LordOfThePings
[22:26:00] <nemo> if some (idiotic) site insists on special character, I tack on a $ but it has essentially no value for password strength
[22:26:38] <nemo> CaCode: in some sense the firefox set of characters would be similar-ish to this one. https://m8y.org/tmp/make_token.txt  (a token generator I whipped up once)
[22:27:10] <nemo> in fact, they may well be doing the exact same thing and excluding confusables
[22:27:22] <nemo> CaCode: it means a set of characters that are easily distinguished and easily typed in
[22:27:33] <nemo> and is relatively compact
[22:27:45] <nemo> this is the exact same approach used for generation of tokens in many other systems. usually the exact same set is homed in on
[22:27:55] <nemo> $ xkcdpass
[22:27:55] <nemo> satchel earplugs chasing accent reminder unicorn
[22:27:58] <nemo> another approach

[22:30:17] *** Joins: skapata (~Skapata@user/skapata)
[22:30:58] <nemo> Oh. And xkcdpass -V is interesting as well... With the current options, your word list contains 7227 words.  A 6 word password from this list will have roughly 76 (12.82 * 6) bits of entropy, assuming truly random word selection.
[22:30:58] *** Joins: digin4 (~digin4@user/digin4)
[22:31:22] <nemo> This is adequate for a password, obviously it would not be sufficient for tokens, in part due to birthday paradox
[22:31:35] <CaCode> nemo: I hear your point
[22:32:29] <CaCode> I guess I didn't consider the human half of the equation

[22:32:50] <nemo> well. human and machine. both can have issues with weird characters. but regardless
[22:32:59] <nemo> the critical element is number of tokens times length
[22:33:13] <nemo> adding special characters improves this by only a tiny amount. at cost of more failures
[22:33:25] <nemo> and making entering on a phone a pain and...
[22:33:27] *** Quits: digin4 (~digin4@user/digin4) (Client Quit)
[22:33:40] <nemo> you get far more benefit just by adding one more character to the random string
[22:33:46] *** Quits: digin4_ (~digin4@user/digin4) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:33:47] <nemo> but they have the length set long enough already
[22:35:48] <CaCode> ` ~! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) _ + | } { “ : ? > < [ ] \ ; ’ , . / - =
[22:35:56] <nemo> yeah. all of those are terrible ☺
[22:36:01] <nemo> regrettably some sites still require them
[22:36:10] <nemo> so I use ! or $ for my meaningless figleaf
[22:36:16] <CaCode> 33 additional all ascii characters
[22:36:23] <nemo> yeah. so what?
[22:36:33] <CaCode> more than the capitalized letters
[22:36:39] <nemo> again. what are you trying to win
[22:36:41] <CaCode> it's the largest of the subsets
[22:37:06] <nemo> you're using more confusable, more easily mangled by an interface, and harder to type on a phone keyboard.
[22:37:09] <nemo> and for what
[22:37:12] <nemo> so your password can be a tiny bit shorter?
[22:37:19] <nemo> 10 characters instead of 15?
[22:37:20] <nemo> that's not a win
[22:37:29] <CaCode> no, no the leanght has to be 12 chars or better 16
[22:37:36] <nemo> ...
[22:37:46] <CaCode> I was basing all this on using password managers 
[22:38:06] <CaCode> so that having to type the pw wouldn't even come into it
[22:38:24] <nemo> CaCode: I use password managers too
[22:38:26] <nemo> firefox and others
[22:38:39] <nemo> I *still* end up having to type it into a system where I'm not linked to password manager from time to time
[22:38:42] <CaCode> do you use horse battery staple's?
[22:38:51] <nemo> not if I'm using the firefox autogenerate
[22:38:53] <nemo> when lazy
[22:39:06] <nemo> for example. My alarm company website has an app. the app can't be linked to my firefox password manager
[22:39:11] <nemo> so I have to type it in on a phone keyboard
[22:39:15] <nemo> ditto my banking software
[22:39:25] <nemo> CaCode: I do use xkcdpass though
[22:39:43] <nemo> both xkcdpass and firefox password manager offer sufficient entropy. you can tune xkcdpass to be insanely long if you really want
[22:40:05] <nemo> so. going back to your idea... you want 16 characters with 95 permutations. So 95¹⁶
[22:40:15] <nemo> this is no doubt more combinations
[22:40:26] <nemo> I'm curious, however as to what exactly your attack scenario is, where this matters
[22:40:33] <nemo> bitcoin fortune private key?
[22:40:59] <nemo> 4.4x10³¹ vs 7.7×10²⁶
[22:41:12] <CaCode> well anything that is common, or human picked can also be somewhat less random
[22:41:38] <CaCode> more predictable because we people share a lot of common traits, like picking birthdays or petnames as passwords
[22:41:47] <nemo> the firefox password manager *already* has 10 000 000 000 000 times more permutations than the xkcdpass 4 words method
[22:42:40] <nemo> CaCode: again. what's the attack scenario. is it their website gets hacked and your *COMPLETELY RANDOM ONE USE ONLY* password gets leaked in a password guess set?
[22:42:43] <nemo> big deal
[22:42:58] <nemo> nevermind the fact that 10²⁶ combinations is a hell of a lot of permutations to try even then
[22:43:09] <nemo> if it's people attempting the website, let's go back to the XKCD example
[22:43:17] <nemo> his 4 random words would resist for 550 years
[22:43:35] <nemo> the mozilla one would resist for 5 500 000 000 000 000 years
[22:43:48] <nemo> yours would resist for a lot longer (heat death of the universe?) but who cares
[22:43:49] <CaCode> you made a good point
[22:43:49] <CaCode>  
[22:44:36] <nemo> I could then say. CaCode, your password should be even stronger.  
[22:44:37] <nemo> $ maketoken 100
[22:44:38] <nemo> Hb6DRdJsHpsBjsyagQrG6UnjSTtqre8F5HSkL72efNnmX9kqBsF39amKQ36V375jCtqDyVbUPW7TC5ZqnxnKbXkrwqBbVMANvm86
[22:44:50] <nemo> so much stronger ♥ - but why? there has to be a cutoff. there has to be a plausible reason for it
[22:46:23] *** Quits: Furai (~Furai@cookiehoster.furai.pl) (Quit: WeeChat 3.3)
[22:46:39] <CaCode> so having something like Kw8{Fa6%Us5| if it wasn't ordered would be one of the best possible passwords for 12 digits
[22:46:58] <CaCode> but you convinced me that it is not neccessary
[22:47:16] <nemo> *if* your cutoff is 12 characters for some reason, then that password would, strictly speaking, be stronger. but calling it best is ignoring the universe of possibilities somewhat
[22:47:19] <nemo> I would say
[22:47:28] <CaCode> true
[22:47:41] <nemo> Kw😃a6%UὫs5|  is even better 😝
[22:48:01] <nemo> and hell. on a phone 😃 and 😉 might even be easier to type ☺ ☺
[22:48:09] <CaCode> my pw was ordered which doesnt make it that strong, yeah unicode would be even better but i agree that only using ascii is probably beneficial
[22:48:24] <nemo> depends what it's beneficial for.  I'd say for humans, not so much
[22:48:31] <nemo> humand can distinguish O and 😃 easily
[22:48:40] <nemo> they cannot easily distinguish |1Il

[22:49:49] <CaCode> it's not insane really, you can write faster by sacrficing some constant time upfront

[22:50:12] <CaCode> one symbol one word

[22:51:10] <nemo> "I was once at a luncheon with three Ph.D. students in the Chinese Department at Peking University, all native Chinese (one from Hong Kong). I happened to have a cold that day, and was trying to write a brief note to a friend canceling an appointment that day. I found that I couldn't remember how to write the character 嚔, as in da penti 打喷嚔 "to sneeze". I asked my three friends how to write the 
[22:51:16] <nemo> character, and to my surprise, all three of them simply shrugged in sheepish embarrassment. Not one of them could correctly produce the character."
[22:51:22] <nemo> "Now, Peking University is usually considered the "Harvard of China". Can you imagine three Ph.D. students in English at Harvard forgetting how to write the English word "sneeze"?? Yet this state of affairs is by no means uncommon in China."
[22:51:59] <nemo> I care about this one 'cause my daughter will, next year, have to choose between learning russian in school and chinese

If you think that after three or four years of study you'll be breezing through Confucius and Mencius in the way third-year French students at a comparable level are reading Diderot and Voltaire, you're sadly mistaken. There are some westerners who can comfortably read classical Chinese, but most of them have a lot of gray hair or at least tenure."

[22:55:41] <nemo> CaCode: on the other hand there's other training exercises that require far less rote memorisation and storage capacity
