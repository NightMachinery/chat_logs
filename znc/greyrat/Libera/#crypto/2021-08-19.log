[04:19:00] *** Joins: DoctorD90 (~DoctorD90@user/doctord90)
[04:20:58] <DoctorD90> Hello everybody! I have a question, and I hope it will be simple for your knowledge. I was checking ciphers to update my configuration on server. On Mozilla's page (https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS) for example there are CHACHA20 for TLS, and ECDHE, but NOT for DHE....
[04:22:02] <DoctorD90> unluckly internet is a big copy paste sometimes, so I was figuring out if even mozilla skipped DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305 for error or for any reason. I didnt find out anything against to use DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305
[04:22:08] <DoctorD90> https://ciphersuite.info/cs/TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256/
[04:22:29] <DoctorD90> There is any security reason according to you?
[04:22:35] <Peng> Kind of.
[04:22:45] <ms7821> I suspect it's because ECDHE is preferred to DHE
[04:23:14] <onelegend> Alipha: yeah I was drunk as fuck
[04:23:58] <onelegend> I said some worse shit in other channels
[04:24:42] <Peng> DoctorD90: For one thing, the goal isn't to enable the maximum number of not-insecure cipher suites.
[04:25:17] <DoctorD90> ms7821, but at this point they had to remove also DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 and DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384 cause they added them over (/after) EECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 and ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384
[04:25:35] <Peng> Why would you want to enable DHE?
[04:25:49] <DoctorD90> Peng ok, but at least the most secure and most used/adopted, rigth? Or I mislead?
[04:26:36] <DoctorD90> Peng open the mozilla's page please :) https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS And check intermediate settings please. That's turned on my ligth :)
[04:27:25] <ms7821> :/
[04:27:42] <Peng> You started this conversation by saying it was off
[04:29:23] *** Joins: PinealGlandOptic (~PinealGla@37.115.210.35)
[04:30:06] <ms7821> my suspicion (I don't keep this stuff in my head) is that the last two entries are to support downlevel clients
[04:30:29] <ms7821> so DHE is there under sufferance, rather than as a peer of ECDHE
[04:31:07] <DoctorD90> on Mozilla site's it is OFF (the https://ciphersuite.info/cs/TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256) while the ECDHE version are enabled. I would understand if DHE were disabled at all, but I was interested to understand if thre is any security reason :) (and apologieze, it is really late for me, I didnt expect someone would answer at that time :) Thanks!)
[04:32:33] <DoctorD90> ms7821, yeah....but to support downlevel clients I'd have added the DHE-CHACHA20 version...do you agree? or there is any reason for which the DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305 is unreccomended?
[04:32:50] <Peng> Oh, I misunderstood your question!
[04:32:51] <ms7821> what downlevel clients are going to support chacha20?
[04:33:31] <Peng> DoctorD90: ChaCha is modern. Modern clients are gonna support ECDHE (or even Ed25519).
[04:33:34] <DoctorD90> nice question....I have to search for it...I was focusing on DHE and ECDHE for that side
[04:34:08] <Peng> DHE is also... unloved, for various reasons.
[04:34:10] *** Quits: igemnace (~ian@user/igemnace) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[04:34:32] <DoctorD90> yeah Peng, and from my knowledge also ECDHE and DHE are "relatively" modern and I think, as already stated by ms, that it was added for compatibilities reasons
[04:35:30] <DoctorD90> personally I agree with the modern configuration (only tls1.3) but configuring thing for a wider support without to have problems, I raised that question to my mind :P
[04:35:43] <DoctorD90> Peng a good reading about those reasons?
[04:36:09] <ms7821> interestingly, https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/update-adds-new-tls-cipher-suites-and-changes-cipher-suite-priorities-in-windows-8-1-and-windows-server-2012-r2-8e395e43-c8ef-27d8-b60c-0fc57d526d94 suggests they were added after the others, at least for Windows 8

[04:37:33] <Peng> SChannel has had weird gaps in its cipher suite support.
[04:37:50] <Peng> If I remember correctly, on certain versions, you can only use ECDHE with ECDSA certificates.
[04:37:54] <ms7821> here we go https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1029179#c65

[04:42:21] <DoctorD90> well...in that page or Im tired, i didnt find out the reason to exclude the DHE-RSA-CHACHA20 friend :P
[04:42:33] *** Joins: machinedgod (~machinedg@24.105.81.50)
[04:44:00] <Peng> I'd guess there was no good reason to add it.
[04:44:23] <DoctorD90> from my understanding this should be good enough 'EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM:EECDH+CHACHA20:!DSS'
[04:44:35] <ms7821> chacha20 was only added to windows very recently (Windows 10 I think)
[04:44:42] <Peng> DoctorD90: Good enough for what?
[04:45:07] <DoctorD90> for wide compatibility 
[04:45:30] <DoctorD90> even if Im thinking to test the "modern" version (only tls1.3)
[04:45:37] <ms7821> well that's a different question and not one that's likely to be answered in a casual IRC chat
[04:45:49] <ms7821> the mozilla people put a bunch of time into this, why are their suggestions inadequate?
[04:45:50] <Peng> DoctorD90: How does it improve compatibility to add it?
[04:46:02] <Peng> Oh, never mind me, I forgot what we were talking about.
[04:46:41] <Peng> I didn't get enough sleep yesterday and I'm not thinking well. :/
[04:46:45] <DoctorD90> Peng just cause otherwise I should declare a long list of Ciphers or play with exclusion...
[04:46:55] <Peng> DoctorD90: What's wrong with copying and pasting a long list?
[04:47:00] <ms7821> just use https://ssl-config.mozilla.org/
[04:47:30] <Peng> If you only support TLS 1.3, you don't even need to set any cipher suites.
[04:47:43] <DoctorD90> ms7821, yeah....I think the same but sometimes could be there specific reason to exclude something, and if thery are not about security, for me are ok :P
[04:48:08] <DoctorD90> EXACTLY XD with tls1.3 the life would be totally easier!
[04:48:26] <DoctorD90> I have just to check that all my sw/apps will support it
[04:48:56] <ms7821> point https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest at your server, it does handshake simulation
[04:50:12] <DoctorD90> yeah, I did last year when I updated things, but I forget with ZNC and Im also giving an hand to ZNC. So I prefer to go with openssl command line :D
[04:50:36] <ms7821> ok, I'm out, have fun
[04:50:50] <DoctorD90> i dont remember how ssllabs works on other things than webservers....
[04:51:00] <DoctorD90> thanks of everything ms7821 ! have a good n8
[04:51:07] <DoctorD90> Peng, you too ;) n8
[04:53:28] <Peng> There are other scanners that support other ports, but I haven't used them. :<

[19:09:30] <ms7821> yeah, only DHE requires dhparams
[19:09:44] <sonOfRa> Alipha: I think you're correct, because with ECDHE, you set a curve anyways, and the curve is the parameters

[19:11:38] <DoctorD90> perfect! Im rigth understanding :P thank you guys!
[19:14:23] <ms7821> hmm, not as you worded it originally, it doesn't "use DHE"
[19:15:10] <ms7821> it's perhaps best described as a variant of DHE
