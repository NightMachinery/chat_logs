[02:35:28] <rijndael> twkm, then let me structure my question differently - I wish to limit the amount of disk writing on a cp operation so that it doesn't disrupt my system. imagine I had to copy 300GB of data on a separate partition on the same hdd where my OS is installed. aside from ionice and nice, any other solution?
[02:35:38] <twkm> consider using rsync if you'd prefer a rate-limit.  #rsync for more.
[02:35:38] <rijndael> these are bash related tools
[02:35:43] <twkm> wrong.
[02:35:55] <twkm> bash has nothing for what you want.
[02:36:42] <twkm> bash can invoke a utility, that might self-ratelimit or that ratelimits what it runs, but the only bash part of it is the invocation.
[02:36:43] <rijndael> twkm, *trolls* - it actually does, it's called sleep 10ms
[02:36:58] <greycat> *plonk*
[02:36:59] <rijndael> but that's innefective.
[02:37:05] <twkm> you cannot inject a sleep into some already running process.
[02:37:25] <greycat> not worth trying to interact with him at this point.  he's completely delusional.
[02:37:28] <rijndael> twkm, I can't, but nothing stops me from suspending it for 10ms, resuming the process for 10ms, repeat and rinse.

[02:57:49] <kurahaupo> Emil: I disagree with "it's easier to always use braces in variable expansions than to hunt for the error when you hit edge cases". This neglects the cost: with practice it is obvious when reading code where variable names end, so braces act as an alert to say "something special here, pay more attention". Widespread extraneous braces make it slower and harder to see where something special is really going on.

I just wanted to ask before I try to devise some hack way of doing it on my own.

[07:22:27] <tickle> for the most part I like the case sensitivity

[07:29:03] <pj> tickle: anyways, you can mv files and directories from one directory to another easily enough, and if both directories are on the same filesystem it doesn't require much overhead (it only changes the directory entries, doesn't move the actual content).
[07:31:07] <tickle> Yeah I can handle that I am pretty sure, I was mostly asking in case there was a solution like tree that would restore a given tree for example
[07:32:13] <tickle> A lot of the time I go to fix a problem I am having when im done I find out it has already been done better and faster in the 80s by smarter people

[10:24:23] <lopid> what's piping to touch supposed to do?
[10:25:14] <gsu> indeed, but I guess if I'll split this into two "sudo -H -u root bash -c ..." it won't work either?
[10:25:21] <lopid> what if there are more than one *release*s?
[10:25:38] <gsu> will fix that later, now just wanna make this work
[10:25:58] <geirha> to run two commands in sequence, you can put ; between them

[13:57:30] <tinytoast> is it possible to use globs with [[ -e file ]]? eg [[ -e file* ]] - if not what is a decent alternative? i'm going through a directory of images that have different extensions hence asking about the glob possibility.

[13:58:54] <Patsie> yes and no, technically the glob will work, but it will expand into any and all filenames that it mathes, _before_ the test -e
[13:59:18] <Patsie> so you will have [[ -e file1 file2 file3 file4 ]], which is in itself then syntactically not valid
[14:00:59] <tinytoast> Patsie: ah wow okay, wasn't aware it could get so messy. i reckon at this time i'll just have to use find for now until i get better at this stuff. thanks for further education.

[16:55:49] <tickle> yeah, I am trying to loop over each line in the output and currently the for i in $(find $1 -type d | uniq) is treating the spaces as the end of a line, so when a directory has a space it ends up looping over a bunch of directories that arent "real"
[16:56:19] <Riviera> !drlwf > tickle
[16:56:20] <greybot> tickle: https://mywiki.wooledge.org/DontReadLinesWithFor ... "for" is for iterating arguments/arrays, not strings. Never do: for x in $(cat file), or for x in $var; instead, use a glob (*.txt), an array ("${hosts[@]}") or a while-read loop. See also https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls#pf1
