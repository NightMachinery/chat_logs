[00:00:05] <bomb> anyway JakeSays I just inform you that Ukraine is gone. just don't get surprised when you hear it
[00:00:24] <JakeSays> it seems that your attitude is "don't piss off the bully"
[00:00:47] <blezz> what happens when you piss off the bully?
[00:01:00] <JakeSays> blezz: you get kicked
[00:01:05] <JakeSays> once
[00:01:37] <JakeSays> but the alternative is worse - you keep getting bullied
[00:02:43] <bomb> alternative was smooth transitioning to NATO
[00:02:52] <bomb> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_NATO#Member_countries
[00:02:58] <bomb> sort by "Accession"
[00:03:14] <JakeSays> lol what?
[00:03:19] <bomb> new ones are all ex-Soviet countries or members
[00:03:26] <JakeSays> of course
[00:03:48] <JakeSays> the alternative is not a smooth accession to nato
[00:03:49] <bomb> Ukraine and George failed at it because of the incapable governments
[00:04:01] <bomb> yeah, then you end up in Russian Tsardom
[00:04:14] <JakeSays> bomb: ukraine failed because of the previous government
[00:04:19] <JakeSays> not the current one
[00:04:50] <bomb> so you're very good friends with Zelensky
[00:05:00] <JakeSays> i can read
[00:05:08] <bomb> I can't find another reason to trust him this much
[00:05:28] <JakeSays> trust who? zelensky?
[00:06:49] <smallville7123> https://gist.github.com/mgood7123/c0315efb426d730b032a261f1eea3471 why do i get `System.InvalidCastException: Specified cast is not valid.`
[00:07:06] <bomb> you just don't seem to understand the real issue here
[00:07:06] <JakeSays> smallville7123: because the cast is invalid
[00:07:15] <JakeSays> bomb: what is the real issue?
[00:07:22] <smallville7123> for https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/xamarin.forms.itemsview-1.itemtemplate?view=xamarin-forms
[00:08:53] <blezz> JakeSays the real issue is that nato is expanding until there are no buffer territories between russia and nato. Which triggered Russia to do something real this time
[00:08:54] <bomb> JakeSays Russia feel trapped by NATO. he gotta calm down
[00:09:16] <JakeSays> blezz: yes, that is putin's issue
[00:09:23] <JakeSays> i've known that all along
[00:09:34] <JakeSays> bomb: i fully understand that
[00:09:42] <JakeSays> but that is currently irrelevant
[00:10:26] <blezz> but putin can and possibly _will_ make it a world issue
[00:10:58] <JakeSays> blezz: well, it's pretty much a world issue now
[00:11:59] <JakeSays> smallville7123: where in that code is the bad cast
[00:12:27] <smallville7123> i still get it even if i use `ItemsSource = new ObservableCollection<FileView_Path>(dirs);`

[02:25:43] <brianonymous_> that was me last night
[02:25:50] <brianonymous_> thats the worst
[02:25:57] <JakeSays> "In September 2007, Russia exploded the largest thermobaric weapon ever made. Its yield was reportedly greater than the smallest dial-a-yield nuclear weapons at their lowest settings."
[02:26:26] <pandem> wasnt the MOAB also one of those
[02:26:35] <JakeSays> yeah but smaller
[02:26:55] <JakeSays> russia calls theirs FOAB
[02:26:56] <pandem> is this GOAB
[02:27:10] <Nasp> Imagine one of those people being in coma from covid
[02:27:13] <Nasp> Then waking up to this
[02:27:15] <pandem> i wonder if the grand parents would be bigger or smaller
[02:27:26] <JakeSays> it produces 44KT boom booms
[02:27:40] <JakeSays> Nasp: that would suck
[02:28:00] <JakeSays> damn. FAOB is 4x as stronger than MOAB
[02:28:05] <pandem> idk, a war is hardly something unusual
[02:28:19] <Nasp> I wonder if ever will stop killing eachother
[02:28:25] <brianonymous_> did putin put nuclear forces on high alert, ive been kinda out of the loop
[02:28:34] <JakeSays> brianonymous_: he did! fun times
[02:28:44] <brianonymous_> oh, well thats wonderful
[02:29:11] <xb0o2> I mean, if he's trying to sell NATO as a threat domestically, surely it's a given to do that
[02:29:13] <JakeSays> so FOAB is twice as big as the nuke dropped on heroshima
[02:29:14] <pandem> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars:_2003%E2%80%93present there's some wars
[02:29:37] <pandem> usa 25 wars in the last 19 years and russia only 18
[02:29:39] <brianonymous_> yeah, the japan bombs were like 20
[02:30:05] <JakeSays> so a couple of those bastards would pretty much flatten kiev
[02:30:44] <brianonymous_> i would hope that many intercept batteries are in route
[02:31:07] <Nasp> JakeSays: Twice as big, but not necessarily twice as deadly i think
[02:31:07] <JakeSays> waaaiiitt.. foab is 44 tons, not 44kt
[02:31:27] <bomb> that's almost like fireworks
[02:31:28] <JakeSays> so not even close
[02:31:38] <Nasp> JakeSays: Yeahj that makes more sense
[02:32:53] <brianonymous_> they say the oklahoma bomb was 0.002kt
[02:33:07] <pandem> what about the beirut one
[02:33:20] <brianonymous_> 2.7
[02:33:38] <pandem> 1.1kt according to wikipedia
[02:34:11] <brianonymous_> oh, my bad, they say 2.7kt was stored there
[02:34:36] <brianonymous_> yeiling 0.5 to 1.1
[02:35:04] <brianonymous_> so 44 isnt playing games
[02:35:05] <JakeSays> huh. so most modern nukes are fusion bombs
[02:35:55] <brianonymous_> fission started with fusion boost or some such sthit?

[03:14:42] <pandem> normally you have a distance of 100 meters between trucks
[03:14:48] <pandem> but this convoy had like 5 meters
[03:14:57] <JakeSays> 100 meters? that's excessive
[03:15:01] <pandem> so if ukraine has any aerial capabilities that should be fucked

[04:13:42] <bomb> sysRPL I only read good comments about solvespace. but that's fucking MS-DOS level UI

[04:29:12] <Nasp> JakeSays: well this is straight from their website
[04:29:35] <sysRPL> so what i want to do is design some plastic parts to hold my 2d plotter parts
[04:29:52] <JakeSays> hmm
[04:30:03] <sysRPL> and run the servos / motors from a pi zero 2 using my c# library
[04:30:56] <sysRPL> i don't know of anyone who was designed a printer / plotter based on linux ... they all use microcontrollers as far as i can tell

[04:32:09] *** Quits: moose (~moose@user/moose) (Quit: The system has requested shutdown. Reason: AC Po...)
[04:32:19] <sysRPL> the problem from what other people has said is that the linux os overhead causes inaccurate motor step timings
[04:32:51] <sysRPL> but i think people haven't really tried on a headless linux sbc
[04:33:09] <sysRPL> or haven't tried correctly
[04:33:37] <sysRPL> so i am to find out
[04:33:41] <sysRPL> * aim
[04:35:13] <sysRPL> does anyone want to help with that? that is using c# to control electronics / machines with realtime limits
[04:35:22] <bomb> I wouldn't use stock Ubuntu for a missile system
[04:35:42] <bomb> not me, but that sounds like a cool project
[04:36:24] <sysRPL> this is just for fun stuff ... but possibly leading to more if the results show a lot of `snap`
[04:36:53] <bomb> tomorrow is going to be long. me need sleep
[04:36:55] <bomb> good night
[04:36:57] <sysRPL> `snap` meaning a lot of idle time waiting for commands, and reacting quickly when new commands are executed
[04:37:00] <Nasp> sysRPL: I'm doing a bit of a similar project, trying to extract data from my power meter :D
[04:37:10] <Nasp> But seems like someone have already made it in python and i may just use that

[04:37:55] <sysRPL> Nasp: they make a whole lot of voltage / current measuring electronic components
[04:38:13] <sysRPL> and integrating them with a pi or c# isn't that difficult
[04:38:13] <Nasp> JakeSays:  Yeah i dont like that part eithier
[04:38:35] <sysRPL> but for what you likely want, the voltage / current might be quite large
[04:38:56] <JakeSays> Nasp: just rewrite it
[04:38:58] <Nasp> No it's 3 volts
[04:39:09] <sysRPL> Nasp: did you want to measure power for your entire home or for a single appliance?
[04:39:15] <Nasp> JakeSays: Yeah i may do that
[04:39:21] <Nasp> sysRPL:  entire home
[04:39:41] <sysRPL> Nasp: your home uses more than 3 volts
[04:39:49] <Nasp> Yes but i an talk to the power meter
[04:39:55] <Nasp> It's a lot safer than trying to measure the mains
[04:40:24] <sysRPL> does you power meter have a diagnostic output channel / wires?
[04:40:49] <sysRPL> a serial interface perhaps
[04:41:00] <JakeSays> not as stimulating tho
[04:41:37] <sysRPL> Nasp: you should check out Matthias Wandel
[04:42:04] <sysRPL> he's a smart guy wh has done all kinds of experiments like that
[04:42:07] <Nasp> sysRPL:  Yes it has a diagnostic port where i can talk to it
[04:42:11] <Nasp> YEah i know who he is
[04:42:13] <Nasp> I like his woodworking
[04:42:24] <Nasp> But i dont think he's done anything like that
[04:42:33] <JakeSays> Nasp: done anything with those esp32's?
[04:42:34] <sysRPL> Nasp: that diagnostic port probably uses a UART

[13:22:02] <interop_madness> I'm worried that Putin will escalate the war to methods he used in Chechnya, e.g. attacking the civilian population and escalating the conflict with Europe to nuclear weapons based on Russia's current doctrine to force an adversarie's hand with nukes: https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2000-05/russias-military-doctrine
[13:28:47] <bomb> that's likely, because he doesn't have anything to lose anymore
[13:29:29] <interop_madness> One can only hope his generals decide on a coup d'etat. The KGB tried to oust Yeltsin for less.
[13:30:28] <bomb> Yeltsin was a turd. Putin is KGB himself
[13:33:32] <bomb> despite American/European media, it seems the only peaceful way out is to leave Ukraine to Russians.

[13:35:24] <bomb> win-win for both NATO/EU and Russia
[13:35:39] <MatthiasVance> How is it a win/win for NATO/EU? I think neutral would mean don't join either
[13:36:43] <bomb> if Ukraine joins NATO and EU, that's +1944 kilometers of Russian border. that's dangerous
[13:37:13] <Babbage> part of the problem is putins stuck in cold war mindset vs western leaders who are in a `modern` mindset, with a big disconnect in the middle, and russia are pissed that west side ignored a load of stuff russia have said over the years and warned them about, while the west think hes (justifiably a lot would say) off his rocker
[13:38:16] <bomb> I mean, USA (thus NATO) is as expansionist as Russia. both parties live in cold war
[13:38:30] <interop_madness> Babbage, OTOH Putin's reasoning is based on false premises, e.g. the "NATO promised to never expand in the east" claim. This was a quote during the reunification of Germany and it was limited to not stationing NATO forces on the territory of the former GDR

[15:22:01] <_genuser_> so interesting situation. R9 270 (amd) card. plugged into it an ultrawide. Recognizes two inputs as 2560x1440. But after going to sleep, when the monitors wakes up, the HDMI input is switch to 1920x1080, while the other remains 2560x1440.
[15:23:01] <_genuser_> and then it fails to recognize that the hdmi monitor can even support anything higher than 1920x1080. Then you have to launch amd settings  app (the control center) and create a specific profile with custom resolution and apply that.

[15:36:04] <Flonk> Suchiman, `Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Processor.EventProcessorClient` needs a `BlobContainerClient` where it will store data to synchronizie itself with other EventProcessorClients that are trying to access the same EventHub.

[17:25:59] <eurogos> reason: I'm trying to migrate / update userId from int to string(uuid) - I have written some c# to update the userId field and then make that update in each FK reference
[17:26:29] <eurogos> but EF core knows that its a FK so won't let me -> "is part of a key and so cannot be modified or marked as modified. "

[17:28:27] <Suchiman> eurogos: why not do it the way i suggested?
[17:28:48] <interop_madness> irwiss, they'll probably expect countervalue attacks, mostly targetting cities
[17:29:24] <eurogos> i tried but there are multiple reference paths and sqlserver flatly refused
[17:29:56] <eurogos> so for example, order table has userId FK twice (once as recipient and once as recordUpdatedById)
[17:30:15] <Suchiman> eurogos: ahhhhh fuggggg
[17:30:18] <eurogos> if i understand correctly, in this condition sqlserver will not make any cascade

[17:31:15] <eurogos> but it seems that efcore is wise to my sneakt efforts
[17:32:29] <eurogos> I have created sql to remove and reapply constraints - i just need to be able to update the columns
[17:34:00] <eurogos> I suppose I could try and write something with ado.net

[17:39:19] <eurogos> ok...
[17:39:53] <eurogos> if it were just a handfull of references, I could just do it manually and then turn the FK constraints back on

[17:41:56] <eurogos> so maybe ado.net or some kind of stored proc?

[21:23:14] <ern> indeed
[21:30:01] <GunArm> why do you think it is that cell phone phone apps don't come with basic features that would make spam calls irrelevant?
[21:30:24] <jonp> because it's Not Their Problem
[21:30:32] <jonp> it's the telco's problem
[21:30:32] *** Quits: bomb (~bomb@user/bomb) (Remote host closed the connection)
[21:30:40] <jonp> or, really, *your* problem
[21:30:48] <GunArm> my old phone had a feature to block all calls from any number not in your address book
[21:30:50] <GunArm> it was great
[21:31:23] <GunArm> now the telcos are doing a decent job at marking these calls as Telemarketer or Spam, but the phones cant do anything to just ignore that
[21:31:25] *** Joins: bomb (~bomb@user/bomb)
[21:31:56] <Suchiman> GunArm: hehe yeah i also have a fancy phone that can do such things ;>
[21:32:48] <GunArm> google phone app, the actual google one has a checkbox for like "block spam" or something like that, but from what I can tell it doesn't do anything
[21:34:00] <jonp> GunArm: iOS allows that, but you need to be in Do Not Disturb: https://www.macworld.com/article/230374/how-to-block-all-calls-except-those-from-your-contacts.html
[21:34:30] <Suchiman> GunArm: ah dunno about mobile, never get spam calls on mobile xD have that feature on landline
[21:35:18] <GunArm> no spam on mobile???
[21:35:30] <Suchiman> not once xD
[21:35:34] <jonp> wow
[21:35:38] <jonp> what country/telco?
[21:35:38] <GunArm> that's amazing, you're in a rare lucky position
[21:35:42] <Suchiman> GunArm: but hey, this is germany :P
[21:35:53] <Suchiman> spam calls are illegal if you do not opt-in
[21:36:02] <GunArm> yeah same here basically
[21:36:12] <GunArm> but they can just do it anyway and no one has any jurisdiction to stop them
[21:36:19] <GunArm> in fact they are using our do not call list as a lead sheet
[21:36:28] <Suchiman> lol
[21:36:51] <GunArm> i've got 5 calls since i got into work 2 hours ago
[21:37:01] <GunArm> ^that's worse than usual
[21:37:22] <Suchiman> there's jurisdiction here to fine violators, it's a bit tricky if the calls are comming from out of country but there also have been successes there at just blocking the numbers
[21:37:40] <GunArm> germany telcos might just be more willing to block the major telephone networks that are enabling it

[21:38:05] <Suchiman> well it's not the telco's job to do that here ;)
[21:38:26] <Suchiman> i mean blocking from a technical side, yes, but it's all controlled by the gov
[21:39:05] <GunArm> our networks are not willing to block all traffic from other big networks that are known to be the major sources of it, because there's legit traffic from there too
[21:39:24] <GunArm> plus, the spam calls make money for them
[21:39:49] <GunArm> although that is the continual threat that has been "in progress to be implemented" for years

[21:53:02] <bomb> did you provide him with the design documentations of the aforementioned system?
[21:55:31] <GunArm> trying to update some old http post code with newer dotnet core stuff, anyone know where I can find an example of this code being used? https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/aspnet/hh944682(v=vs.118)
[21:55:43] <Nasp> EU wanted to make spam the Telco's problem and they should
[21:56:06] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Like most thing, even though they are illegal it still happens
[21:57:00] <GunArm> the docs suck so I can't be sure, but I think the idea the response you get back is deserialized to type <T>, but you also pass it this 'T value' and i'm not sure what that is, other than maybe the data you are posting?  but that would mean it expects your post body and response to be the same object type which seems useless
[21:58:15] <jonp> GunArm: UTSL? https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/3ae87395f638a533f37b8e3385f6d3f199a72f4f/src/libraries/System.Net.Http.Json/src/System/Net/Http/Json/HttpClientJsonExtensions.Post.cs
[21:58:20] *** Joins: DoofusCanadensis (~DoofusCan@207.229.38.10)
[21:58:28] <jonp> looks like it uses JsonContent.Create<T>()
[22:00:14] <jonp> which likewise isn't well documented: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.http.json.jsoncontent.create?view=net-6.0
[22:00:29] <GunArm> hmm
[22:00:35] <jonp> but also has source: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/3ae87395f638a533f37b8e3385f6d3f199a72f4f/src/libraries/System.Net.Http.Json/src/System/Net/Http/Json/JsonContent.cs

[22:02:54] <GunArm> lol yeah
[22:03:45] <GunArm> even from just looking at the top level prototype though (and one level down that it's serializing 'value' into the content), seems to confirm they expect your post body and response to be the same type
[22:04:03] <GunArm> i don't do very many http requests but I can't imagine that's common
[22:11:23] <Suchiman> GunArm: oh well that's easy, PostAsJsonAsync serializes the `T value` to json and posts that as application/json to the specified endpoint
[22:11:38] <Suchiman> GunArm: the response is just an HttpResponseMessage to any deserialization you have to do manually :P
[22:11:53] <Suchiman> using something like response.Content.ReadAs...
[22:14:42] *** Joins: alguien (~alguien@user/alguien)
[22:16:12] <GunArm> ohh
[22:17:25] <GunArm> hmm ok i thought the whole point of these extensions was that it did the deserialization for you
[22:17:42] <GunArm> (i'm wayy behind on this stuff, converting from webclient)
[22:18:16] <jonp> well, you mentioned PostAsJsonAsync(), which would be *serialization*, not deserialization, right?
[22:18:28] <GunArm> PostAsJsonAsync<T>()
[22:18:38] <jonp> still not sure what is used for that serialization; i lost interest.
[22:18:54] <GunArm> which sets a return type, I thought for the purpose of deserialization after getting a response

[22:21:50] <Suchiman> GunArm: it does not set a return type, the normal method on HttpClient is .Post(Uri, HttpContent) and this extension is like PostThisObjectAsJson(Uri, T)

[22:25:31] <GunArm> ok, and I guess PostAsJsonAsync(uri, object) is just sugar for PostAsJsonAsync<type of object>(uri, object)
[22:27:51] <Suchiman> GunArm: prolly yeah
