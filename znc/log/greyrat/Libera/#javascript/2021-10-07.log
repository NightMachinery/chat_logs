[01:38:05] <Donitz> where are the max fines defined
[01:38:18] <ljharb> Donitz: it's a civil court, there is no maximum. it's up to the judge
[01:38:25] <Donitz> that's a lawsuit
[01:38:29] <ljharb> Donitz: in the dominos case, the award sought was $4000 per site visit
[01:38:31] <Donitz> will they ask you to fix it before they sue you
[01:38:33] <goldmund> Donitz, you should google some of the known cases. It's pretty damned hefty
[01:38:38] <ljharb> Donitz: yes, they will
[01:38:45] <Donitz> so what are the fines
[01:38:49] <Donitz> before the lawsuit
[01:38:55] <ljharb> there are no fines, it's civil damages
[01:38:57] <ljharb> which are unbounded.
[01:39:04] <ljharb> Donitz: they can sue you even after you fix it. any period of time where it's not accessible is violating the law.
[01:39:37] <goldmund> ljharb, How does this work when dealing with paid software? Do the same rules apply?
[01:39:38] <ljharb> obviously if you fixed it, and the violation wasn't intentional/malicious, a judge is likely to avoid fines
[01:39:43] <ljharb> goldmund: of course they apply
[01:39:55] <ljharb> goldmund: there is no scenario where the ADA does not apply
[01:40:09] <goldmund> That I did not know.
[01:40:10] <ljharb> pretty sure you have to have wheelchair ramps at spin classes, for example
[01:40:27] <goldmund> right..
[01:40:36] <Donitz> that's not true at all
[01:40:41] <Donitz> there are cases where ADA does not apply
[01:40:53] <ljharb> Donitz: which?
[01:41:07] <Donitz> religious organizations, small private business with less than 15 employees not using the public for profit
[01:41:12] <ljharb> fair pushback tho, there probably are scenarios where the ADA does not apply
[01:41:13] <ljharb> ok
[01:41:23] <Donitz> "The ADA applies to organizations and businesses that fit one or more of the following criteria: All local, county, state, and federal government agencies. Any business that relies on the general public or for their benefit. Privately run companies that currently have 15 or more employees"
[01:41:27] <goldmund> So my understanding of this from my last job was that ADA applies if
[01:41:32] <goldmund> lol you beat me to it Donitz
[01:41:50] <ljharb> a private company with < 15 employees tho, that *is* using the public for profit, counts
[01:42:16] <Donitz> so you're a single person who does private stuff, but not for your own profit
[01:42:20] <Donitz> but for the public's profit
[01:42:24] <goldmund> "relies on the..." is very vague; this could be anything and to ljharb's point
[01:43:35] <Slade> ADA public reliance clause is pretty well defined these days
[01:44:26] <Slade> a restaurant, hotel, retail store etc needs to be ADA compliant, your 3 man "next facebook" running in the garage does not
[01:45:27] <ljharb> either way tho, if somebody's looking for reasons to get away with discrimination, it may or may not help to point out ethical issues
[01:46:03] <Slade> hmm. there might be a difference between taking the time to find a loophole, and spending a lot of time and money to learn the law and become compliant

[02:54:01] <Minall> Hello Javascript Community!... Anyone using HandleBars
[02:54:14] <Minall> Is there a way to access a children when the name may be unknown?
[02:54:31] <ljharb> now that's a name i haven't heard in a long time
[02:55:17] <Minall> ljharb: Trully, yet it is used a lot in the project I'm in so...
[02:58:46] <newton> is lookup what you want? https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/builtin-helpers.html#lookup
[02:59:08] <znf> running this cloudflare worker -- https://pastie.dev/gBErqk.js -- I'm getting: Uncaught (in promise) SyntaxError: Unexpected token u in JSON at position 0
[02:59:11] <znf> what am I failing at here?
[02:59:19] <znf> line 26
[03:00:00] <newton> seems like decryptMessage might be returning a string that cannot be parsed as json
[03:00:13] <znf> I'm assuming it's something about async functions, but my simple brain doesn't really understand those parts
[03:00:19] <znf> oh
[03:00:22] <znf> I'm not returning it
[03:00:25] <znf> ...I'm dumb
[03:00:38] <newton> little rubber ducking never hurts
[03:01:23] <znf> well, at least now it changed to
[03:01:23] <znf> Uncaught (in response) SyntaxError: Unexpected token o in JSON at position 1
[03:01:51] <ljharb> znf: looks like you tried to JSON.parse HTML
[03:02:12] <ljharb> znf: or the string representation of an object
[03:02:26] <znf> guess because it's a promise that doesn't fullfill when I decode?
[03:02:37] <ljharb> znf: no it's because you're trying to JSON.parse something that's not JSON
[03:02:48] <newton> try throwing a console.log or debugger in there and see what the result of your decryptMessage is in the first place
[03:03:03] <ljharb> znf: also, on line 26, you're declaring a const inside a block and never using it, so that value gets thrown away almost immediately
[03:03:32] <znf> I plan to use it in the next line
[03:03:41] <znf> {"uid":"363845","expires":1633572437} <- pretty JSON-y to me
[03:03:58] <newton> it's already a js object then
[03:04:49] <newton> (you don't need JSON.parse)
[03:05:48] <ljharb> yup
[03:08:44] <znf> hmm, well, somehow it comes back as undefined
[03:08:46] <znf> https://pastie.dev/jeBboA.js
[03:08:56] <znf> console.log(value) now prints 'undefined' :-/
[03:09:11] <ljharb> znf: ok well you can't parse that either
[03:09:11] <znf> I've changed line 14
[03:09:18] <znf> damn it
[03:10:24] <znf> if I just console.log(decryptMessge...)
[03:10:26] <znf> I get: Promise {[[PromiseState]]: "fulfilled", [[PromiseResult]]: undefined}
[03:10:37] <ljharb> znf: ok, so it's a promise
[03:10:39] <ljharb> for undefined
[03:10:49] <ljharb> a) you can't get at the promise value synchronously, ever
[03:10:53] <ljharb> b) it's undefined so there's nothing to get
[03:11:02] <znf> but how is it undefined
[03:11:25] <ljharb> because that's what decryptMessage is returning, i guess
[03:11:59] <znf> but if I console.log() instead of return, it prints the decrypted string (json)
[03:12:46] <ljharb> ok well if you have an async function, it returns a promise
[03:13:04] <ljharb> so obviously you should return the decrypted string, and then it'll be a promise for the string
[03:13:30] <newton> is part of the problem here that the script isn't using await where it could be?
[03:13:54] <ljharb> it's a few things
[03:13:56] <newton> yeah
[03:14:03] <ljharb> including a lack of understanding about how return works, and promises
[03:14:09] <znf> async is hard :(
[03:14:10] <ljharb> !promises intro @ znf
[03:14:10] <jellobot> znf, Promises are placeholders for values that'll be provided in the future. They allow composing asynchronous operations like synchronous ones. See http://robotlolita.me/2015/11/15/how-do-promises-work.html and https://blog.domenic.me/youre-missing-the-point-of-promises/. Contrast with !cps & see https://bevacqua.github.io/promisees/.

[04:11:06] <jaawerth> znf: that's more annoying than promises since you can't pass things around that way (otherwise known as callback hell). also, your JSON.parse is in an async function so you can just do e.g. `const auth = JSON.parse(await decryptMessage( url.searchParams.get('auth') ) )` after making sure you've got return statements at the end of things in the decrypt fn
[04:11:28] <jaawerth> (with the Promise-based version, I mean)
[04:11:59] *** Quits: ttys000 (~ttys000@user/ttys000) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[04:12:44] <znf> for this thing I don't really need to pass stuff around, my decrypted json simply contains a timestamp + an arbitrary string (that I'm not even checking at the moment), all I needed was to check the timestamp against Date.now() and decide if I return a 403 or carry on
[04:12:47] *** Joins: cmbengue (~Thunderbi@207.191.249.160)
[04:16:22] <jaawerth> if it works for you that's fine, but things moved away from that style of callback specifically to make interop easier, so converting a promise back into a callback seems a bit counterproductive to me
[04:17:38] <jaawerth> particularly since async/await makes it easier to unwrap promises without doing a bunch of .then() + callback chaining
[04:18:11] <jaawerth> (in this case you already had async so you just needed to add await)

[06:05:58] <duckgoose> it's only defined in console, so that must be what it is

[07:58:42] <theskillwithin> maybe if you re-assign it to a new variable, then you can change it

[08:02:39] <theskillwithin> similar to spread id think, but worth a shot

[08:05:31] <KevinX> Oh I see it. Did you spread that correctly?
[08:05:46] <KevinX> Is it an array?

[08:07:48] <Crash1hd> this.data is from akita
[08:07:52] <theskillwithin> the 2nd one overrites the first, so if you were trying to add to it, ud have to do that in reverse order
[08:08:16] <KevinX> I think maybe your data isn't what you think it is?
[08:08:34] <Crash1hd> the data shows up hmm odd
[08:08:52] <KevinX> Or the error is coming from something happening later
[08:08:56] <Crash1hd> everything was working until a coworker had me update the listen to akita lol
[08:09:08] <KevinX> I'd look there then
[08:09:31] <Crash1hd> well akita has made this.data readonly (the service listen call did not)
[08:09:35] <Crash1hd> that is the difference
[08:10:11] <KevinX> The error is from a write, not a read. Spread doesn't write
[08:10:15] <KevinX> [...Object.freeze([1,2,3])]
[08:12:39] <Crash1hd> https://imgur.com/a/GvLvElG <-- this is the output
[08:13:02] <Crash1hd> KevinX, no spread would read and create a new obj
[08:13:08] <Crash1hd> that I should then be able to write.
[08:13:11] <Crash1hd> I thought?
[08:13:21] <theskillwithin> sounds like a real brain freeze to debug
[08:13:51] <Crash1hd> pretty much
[08:14:32] <KevinX> this works: const a = [...Object.freeze([1,2,3])]; a.push(4)
[08:15:51] <KevinX> where does the error stack trace point to?
[08:16:12] <Crash1hd> yes, but I am not trying to push I am trying to manipulate the object data inside : const a = [...Object.freeze([{name:'1'},{name:'2'},{name:'3'}])]; a[2].name = '5' (which will work)
[08:16:42] <Crash1hd> I am sure
[08:17:04] <Crash1hd> except its giving me that error doing that. 🤦
[08:20:54] <KevinX> no more ideas from me. I'd just follow the code backwards from the stack trace as best you can
[08:21:25] <Crash1hd> KevinX, thank you for the assist. :)
[08:22:13] <theskillwithin> wait do you have access to when your freezing it?  then just don't freeze it

[08:35:35] <sheetjs> ET clocks are supposed to turn back 2 AM on November 7
[08:35:51] <sheetjs> Excel treats that day as if it had 24 hours
[08:36:10] <sheetjs> so the question is whether the first 1-2 AM or the second 1-2 AM should be dropped
[08:36:49] <Slade> replayed :P
[08:37:15] <sheetjs> it raises a bunch of interesting questions
[08:37:40] <sheetjs> like how do you treat the duration between the first 1:50 AM and the second 1:10 AM

[08:42:12] <sheetjs> excel has no concept of timezone
[08:42:12] <ljharb> so obviously that day's duration could be 23 or 25 hours
[08:42:27] <sheetjs> or DST for that matter
[08:42:37] <ljharb> i mean, if excel hardcodes 24 hours in a day it's already irreparably broken
[08:42:41] <sheetjs> the issue is Excel treats every day as 24 hours of 60 minutes of 60 seconds
[08:42:49] <Slade> your dates wrong

[12:50:30] <Deneb> hoq do I define a global multidimensional array in JavaScript? I have var myIndex = []; at the top of my script, but when I use it in a function I get undefined, e.g. myIndex.push([something]).
[12:52:01] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> idnk
[12:52:04] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> https://paste-bin.xyz/6727
[12:52:23] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> Update(_) { this.Spawn_();  }   Uncaught TypeError: this.Spawn_ is not a function
[12:52:37] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> globals are scary in javascript
[12:52:53] <Deneb> this is what I get: https://paste-bin.xyz/6727
[12:53:15] <Deneb> erm, no, this: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'push')
[12:56:14] <Deneb> Ronalds_Mazitis_: could be that I am going the wrong way about things, but I need somehow to store a multi-dimensional list of attributes, i.e. a list of attributes for item 1, a list of attributes for item 2 etc etc
[12:57:34] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> that is way too complex for stuff I'm doing now, arrays are just usable per one mostly
[12:57:38] <theskillwithin> lol TerrainChunkManager I picture to be a chubby dude
[13:00:04] <theskillwithin> umm srry no offense
[13:01:06] <Deneb> Ronalds_Mazitis_: indeed that seems so. The reference here seems to suggest that Javascript does not support multidimensional arrays natively as such: https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-multidimensional-array/ - however it is possible to construct them
[13:03:40] <Deneb> Ronalds_Mazitis_: so I am trying to use the same approach

[15:35:42] <Deneb> hmw[at]: I tend to use vanilla JS but there seems to be a lot of examples/answers where a mix of both is used. According to one source: jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library...  jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript. Apart from the fact that it always starts with a $, I haven't really looked into it so I don't get the syntax yet but just wondered
[15:37:06] *** Joins: pmercado (~pmercado@186.107.35.198)
[15:37:08] <Deneb> silly_: cross-browser is an interesting aspect. It used to be that IE was always the odd one out. There days it does seem that FF is increasingly becoming so!
[15:37:45] <hmw[at]> The $ glyph is like any other valid character for identifiers. I don't use frameworks by priciple, but some of my older projects had a self-written $() function. It might be useful to know some basics about JQuery so one can understand those explanations better. I think, it is no longer really that much of a benefit, given how much JS has improved, except for some things looking nicer.

[17:30:42] <qswz> oh the reverse thing
[17:31:05] <wedr> I'm forced with my hands. I was tasked to remove all <script> tags containing nonce="..." in them and to run a new build, and I can't revert these changes. I wanted to know if <script> with src attribute pointing to an external JS file will still work with nonce="...".
[17:31:23] <jaawerth> sumthing1980: that said, if items are coming in automatically, you will probably want to use JS to remove the ones at the end of the list once they hit a limit or the browser will run out of memory
[17:31:50] <sumthing1980> neat
[17:32:11] <sumthing1980> but it doesnt go back to being focused on the bottom after you scroll somewhere
[17:32:17] <qswz> !mdn nonce @ wedr
[17:32:18] <jellobot> wedr, nonce - The nonce global attribute is a content attribute defining a cryptographic nonce ("number used once") which can be used by Content Security Policy to determine whether or not a given fetch will be allowed to proceed for a given element. https://mdn.io/nonce
[17:32:31] <jaawerth> true, you'd have to first scroll to the bottom again yourself
[17:32:31] <sumthing1980> I cut the contents to the div when I add things
[17:32:32] <wedr> I know what nonce is
[17:32:33] <jaawerth> that part would need JS
[17:32:45] <wedr> I just don't know if it will execute JS if the JS resides in an external file
[17:32:49] <sumthing1980> so it limits to x bytes
[17:32:51] <jaawerth> but that's morelike usingg F in less anyway - once you scroll up, you need to tell it to start following again
[17:33:01] <sumthing1980> divdataviewspace.innerHTML = x.substring(0,222222);
[17:33:22] <jaawerth> doing it that way will very easily break
[17:33:33] <sumthing1980> it breaks html but not much problem
[17:33:42] <sumthing1980> some occasional > here and there
[17:34:35] <sumthing1980> and before that : var x= divdataviewspace.innerHTML+"\n" +text ;
[17:34:50] <qswz> nonce is ok with cross origin as long as you can coordinates the values and pass that value in CSP header
[17:34:55] <jaawerth> I'd do something like `while (feedList.children.length > limit) { feedList.firstChild.remove(); }` and run it after every update
[17:35:31] <qswz> wedr: well, it seems nonce is only for inline script and style (no src attribute)

[18:55:17] <prussian> simple.
[18:56:02] <Simplar> It can be (1, 454, 'dsajdahs&#$Q$\'fsfdsj     \' \' eek oops', '\'', 31415926)
[18:56:05] <qswz> Simplar: the input is formatted like this? (2, 1, 5, 'foo', 4, '2') or like this 215'foo'4'2'

[18:56:43] <qswz> so why not .slice(1, -1).split(', )?

[18:57:03] <qswz> or I'm missing something
[18:57:12] <Simplar> Because s can have adjacent , and space
[18:57:42] <qswz> so it can be like I said 215'foo'4'2'

[23:35:40] <rdrg109> [Q] I have an array of URLs. I want to scrap information from those urls. Can this be done using Javscript in the Firefox console? I'm not required to use Javascript, but I'm just curious. I know this can be done with Python.
[23:36:47] <ljharb> tsukasadt: ok so this third party is allowed to steal any information out of the browser and compromise your users, and that's ok?
[23:37:41] <tsukasadt> Yeah, I wouldn't trust a major international organization paid to protect user data to protect my data either, but it's above me pay grade.
[23:38:35] <ljharb> lol well you didn't specify who it was
[23:41:04] <onosendi> rdrg109: is this just a one-off thing? It can be done, but the Firefox console is the last place I'd want to write code.
[23:42:19] <onosendi> Actually, I just saw there's a multiline editor mode, which doesn't seem too bad.
[23:42:24] <tsukasadt> Here's the summary of the situation. We use SSO to restrict access to one of our internal servers. Content from this server is embedded into their system for ease of access. However, thanks to cross-origin, the SSO won't authenticate unless they access the server before accessing the embedded content. I need to dynamically identify the embedded content and add an alert below each one. I have the code written and working for
[23:42:24] <tsukasadt> IFRAME embedding, but their JavaScript moves EMBEDs and OBJECTs inside a dynamically generated IFRAME to prevent JavaScript attacks (they implemented it before browsers locked down cross-origin).
[23:43:11] <earendel> "Since they're both loaded by the same page, shouldn't that prevent a cross-origin issue when there is no source?" ..the url of the main document in the iframe and the url of the main document of the window executing the script being on the same domain would cause no cross-origin errors tsukasadt
[23:43:37] <tsukasadt> earendel, there is no URL on the IFRAME.
[23:43:46] <earendel> if you create an iframe loading a document from some other domain, it will have its own policy
[23:43:48] *** Joins: junktext (~junktext@77.247.181.212)
[23:44:15] <earendel> every resource has a url
[23:44:52] <tsukasadt> The body of the IFRAME is created by the JavaScript, just putting the EMBED or OBJECT in it, instead of being directly on the page. No "src" is defined. If you query for it, all you get is an empty string.
[23:47:02] <tsukasadt> If that empty string response is what triggers it, then that answers the question.
