[01:28:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> So I did try to watch that "Foundation" series
[01:28:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Didn't even make it through the first episode
[01:28:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's so bad
[01:32:45] <gwern> ouch
[01:33:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Literally every change they made to the story was bad. Every single one without exception.
[01:34:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> The writers clearly did not understand or did not care about ... just, like, the fundamental concepts that the whole damn plot is based on
[01:34:26] <pompolic> maybe they optimized for marking their territory
[01:34:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> For example: Seldon's trial for sedition or w/e, which in the book is secret, in the show is broadcast to all of Trantor.
[01:35:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> You know, the one where he says "within three centuries, Trantor will lie in ruins and the Empire will fall".
[01:35:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> That was when I closed the video.
[01:36:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> (a) The whole point of psychohistory is that the behavior of large masses of people are predictable *if they do not know about the predictions*
[01:37:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> (b) Broadcasting these predictions of doom, live in 3D, to billions of people, is *literally the diametric opposite* of what the Empire wants, *which is even established in the damn show*
[01:38:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> It makes zero sense. The Imperials' behavior makes no sense, Seldon's behavior makes no sense, no one's behavior makes any sense.
[01:39:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Then there's all the stuff like... they made Gaal Dornick a (like 18 year old or so) black girl, they made Synnax (her homeworld) some sort of weird tribal theocracy or something where everyone lives in mud huts, they gave her this whole persecution backstory because... why? No one knows
[01:40:20] <gwern> she's not a black girl, she's a Black girl, obormot
[01:40:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> They concocted this bizarre shit where the Emperor is actually three guys, who are all clones of a previous emperor but of different ages

[01:40:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> And on and on... this is just the first episode, now
[01:40:37] <mjr> I kinda like the clone-line emperors.
[01:41:22] <mjr> Probably a practical concession to production as well, to be able to have stable actors across a plot that will presumably span a lot of time.
[01:41:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> ehhhh

[04:24:47] <gwern> it's sort of like tech startups. tons of incredibly successful tech startups are launched in 'bad' years! because the best time is always 'when you are ready', and the state of the economy is much less important

[08:40:52] <nshepperd2> ofc it's actually just a test of whether you prefer to take more money away from sociology researchers
[08:41:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> I picked the equal answers all the way through

[10:28:27] <PapuaHardyNet> females = more aesthetic, more compassionate, more peaceful, more unselfish, less self-defending, less thick skinned
[10:28:39] <PapuaHardyNet> yes, females are angels who can do no wrong, men are evil
[10:29:21] <linear> PapuaHardyNet: well tbf I think a lot of the male traits are compliments as well, "more provisational" "more complexity seeking" "more risk taking" I got under there
[10:29:33] <PapuaHardyNet> clearly the writers are either female or have no experience with women
[10:30:27] <PapuaHardyNet> linear: true true
[10:32:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: What if they're not rationalists? They're probably not
[10:33:36] <PapuaHardyNet> feep: no work today?
[10:35:22] <nshepperd2> PapuaHardyNet: being less thick skinned is bad though?
[10:35:43] <Obormot\Gaia> Being more compassionate is also bad
[10:36:07] <kuudes> people seem to feel bad on admitting they are a little thinner skinned than average, I presume
[10:36:16] <Obormot\Gaia> What? Why?
[10:36:43] <Obormot\Gaia> Anyway, most of the traits where male/female differed seemed to me to be ones where the male version is clearly better
[10:36:45] <kuudes> re https://i.imgur.com/ngVopIU.png the relative dip on -0.5
[10:37:21] <kuudes> that seems typical border optimization issue
[10:37:46] <kuudes> ie similar to those where there are way more "just passing" scores than "barely nonpassing" than continuous distribution would imply
[10:38:34] <PapuaHardyNet> I'd be quite sad if females are more aesthetic on average than males
[10:39:06] <nshepperd2> obviously, the right amount of compassion is exactly the amount i have, no more no less
[10:39:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, exactly
[10:39:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> Likewise, I am apparently less moved by artistic beauty than the average m or f, but that just means ms and fs are both *too* moved by artistic beauty (the ms slightly less so)
[10:40:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> And "amicable"? Obviously most people are way too unwilling to contradict the opinions of others
[10:40:38] <nshepperd2> PapuaHardyNet: why
[10:41:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'm apparently more at ease than men or women, and women are less at ease, which means that men, on average, worry too much, and women, on average, worry *way* too much
[10:41:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like... this is just obvious
[10:42:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: Look, people make art to get laid. Since (given human evolved mating strategies) men pursue and women select, it follows that men are gonna be the ones making the art for the women, therefore obviously the women are the ones who gotta be appreciative of aesthetic beauty or w/e
[10:42:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> They're the intended audience!
[10:43:10] <PapuaHardyNet> Huh, that makes a lot of sense
[10:43:43] <nshepperd2> no it doesn't
[10:43:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Don't take it as gospel, it's a just-so story)
[10:43:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> But no, it totes makes sense
[10:44:06] <PapuaHardyNet> it's a Kevin Simmler theory, aka evolutionary theory
[10:44:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Actually the direct inspiration is Hitchens's "women aren't funny" thing
[10:44:27] <nshepperd2> how are you gonna make sufficiently good art if you're not appreciative of aesthetic beauty
[10:44:39] <PapuaHardyNet> exactly
[10:44:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> nshepperd2: You gotta be somewhat appreciative of it but not as much as the people (women) you're making the art for
[10:44:59] <saturn2> it should ask whether you're sexually aroused by artistic beauty
[10:45:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Haha
[10:45:06] <nshepperd2> actually, the men should be under strong selection for aesthetic appreciation, bc they're competing with each other on qualioty
[10:45:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Nah that's wrong, because judgments of status are not directly experienced as sexual
[10:45:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: The connection between those judgments and the resulting feelings of attraction/etc. are - and must be! - opaque to the person experiencing them
[10:46:23] <saturn2> why must they be opaque?

[10:49:08] <saturn2> that actually makes you way more honest
[10:49:13] <PapuaHardyNet> but... I want to make art that other men appreciate, especially because I haven't seen women appreciating art IRL
[10:49:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> What? Get outta here
[10:49:42] <PapuaHardyNet> the taste of most women I know tend to the superficial and mundane, the simplistic sensual pleasures
[10:49:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Haven't you ever been to an art gallery
[10:50:03] <saturn2> most men don't make any art at all
[10:50:05] <PapuaHardyNet> no, I'm too low-class for that (no seriously, I've never been to one, and I do plan to go to one)
[10:50:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like when I was at that van Gogh thing recently (not quite an "art gallery", more like an "exhibition", I guess), there were lots of women there
[10:50:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of all ages! Heck, there were more women than men, I think
[10:50:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> They were totally into all that bullshit
[10:51:13] <saturn2> "art hoes" is a stock phrase
[10:51:15] <PapuaHardyNet> and you didn't really find it as interesting as they did?
[10:51:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: I mean, I gave my opinion of the thing. Grep the logs if you're curious
[10:52:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of course you could say that my taste is too refined for that sort of thing

Created by a Tumblr user known as sensitiveblackperson, the Art Hoe scene was created for POC (people of color) and has been accused of being whitewashed. But the Art Hoe community...)
[10:52:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Seems a bit self-serving though, especially since I know perfectly well I'm not that into art
[10:53:18] <PapuaHardyNet> oh I just grepped the logs.
[10:53:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> I do not grok this "art hoe" business
[10:53:37] <PapuaHardyNet> Obormot, are you sure the girls went there for the art? I have a feeling the art is an excuse for a social excursion

[10:54:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean... it's Manhattan. There's a kajillion places to go. Of all the places in the world, this is the last place where you need an "excuse" to do a social excursion
[10:54:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> If you don't actually like art, just go literally anywhere else
[10:54:46] <PapuaHardyNet> very well
[10:56:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean, I don't doubt there was a spectrum of art-liking in the crowd. After all, I was there!
[10:56:21] <saturn2> this site you found is some random tumblr nonsense
[10:56:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> All I'm saying is that the crowd was not remotely male-biased

[10:57:39] <PapuaHardyNet> that's my 2022 project then
[10:57:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's a strategy *literally* as old as humanity
[10:58:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> "First coined by tumblr user sensitiveblackperson, art hoe is a term specifically for POC or allies who are interested in any kind of art. The term has catalyzed a subculture of white girlsand boys interested in kånken backpacks, art socks, and journaling." ... this is one of the most bizarre things I've come across in a while
[10:59:05] <saturn2> probably not the way you're doing it
[10:59:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> The site PapuaHardyNet linked, and several of these urbandictionary definitions, are really insistent on this whole "POC" angle
[10:59:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> And I still don't understand the concept in the first place
[10:59:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's... people who are interested in art?? Is that something we need a fancy new term for now??
[11:00:46] <saturn2> art hoes are just loose women who hang around the art scene

[17:45:58] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : I was reading a criminology study yesterday. They found a positive correlation between weapon caliber and odds of death. *However* they didn't find a correlation between caliber and death per shot. Meaning a .40 cal would be used in wounding as much as say a .22. Mildly interesting.
[17:47:00] <gwern> so lighter rounds are shot more?
[17:47:11] <two2thehead> dunno
[17:47:47] <two2thehead> By caliber and death odds, I mean a .22 would be less likely to kill someone vs a .40
[17:49:05] <two2thehead> My *pet* hypothesis is that the median level skill of gangbanger is such that the caliber has no effect on actually hitting a target. But I'm not a statistician

[18:12:46] <PapuaHardyNet> "The steps we took for the CC data included text extraction from raw HTML files, scoring extracted documents using a classifier trained on high-quality data, and filtering documents according to their scores. To diversify the training, we also collected the RealNews and CC-Stories datasets."
[18:12:53] <PapuaHardyNet> "Document deduplication is necessary in building training datasets because the same content can be present in multiple documents of different datasets. We used a fuzzy deduplication process at the document level using min-hash LSH to compute a sparse document graph and the connected components in it to identify duplicate documents."

In addition, "Source 1.0" has read about 200 million words . what is this concept?

With the support of such a large-scale data, the data set of "Source 1.0" has naturally become the world's largest high-quality Chinese data set. In terms of computing power, "Source 1.0" consumes a total of about 4095PD (PetaFlop/s-day) . Compared with GPT-3 consumes 3640PD calculations
[18:23:55] <feepbot> to obtain 175 billion parameters, the calculation efficiency is greatly improved. If you let "Source 1.0" "read" 24 hours a day, it only takes 16 days to read almost all the contents of the Chinese Internet in the past five years .'

I tried before but none answered. in Helsinki Uusimaa region in latest week the distribution of covid-hospitalized people have been for [0, 1, 2] doses [66%, 9%, 25%]. The vaccination status of population is [28.6%, 5.1%, 66.3%]. Does this mean that 2 doses protects from hospitalization (25%/66.3%)/(66%/28.6%) ~ 1/6?
[22:01:57] <kuudes> 1/6 feels somewhat low to me?

[22:44:11] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: ie like the floating ToC, but adapted for mobile where vertical is cheap but horizontal/width is costly
[22:44:18] <saturn2> kuudes: CDT goes by what counterfactually would happen because of the decision you made, EDT goes by what you would learn by finding out you made your decision
[22:45:26] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: alos seems like it'd be relatively easy? throw up an empty rectangle, sticky it, inject <title>, and <section> up to root... I'm not sure how quanta does that horizontal scrollbar but it looks like a builtin?
[22:46:24] <kuudes> hmm
[22:46:52] <kuudes> but I was surprised it seems to only be 1/6, I had expected it to be 1/12 or less?
[22:47:12] <saturn2> so with CDT the protection from the vaccine is fixed but unknown, with EDT it could vary depending on what you decide

[22:58:50] <saturn2> yw
[23:02:46] <saturn2> i guess if you continue to participate in mainstream society it's inevitable that you will get it, the remaining considerations are more about delaying it in the hope that better treatments are invented or to avoid getting it while hospitals are overloaded
[23:03:27] <kuudes> I agree
[23:03:50] <kuudes> I would hope that with 3 doses it would not be very hard, but I am unsure
[23:04:13] <kuudes> it seems third dose consistently gives at least 1/10 on all measures compared to 2 doses
[23:04:28] <kuudes> which would imply hospitalization would get at least 1/50 compared to no vaccine
[23:04:57] <kuudes> we got ours on 29th of last month
[23:05:17] <kuudes> so 12 days ago
[23:05:31] <kuudes> presumably it should be at near peak currently

[23:06:11] <kuudes> I recommend you do.
[23:07:06] <kuudes> also, if you choose to go that route, if it is possible, I would recommend you to lie that you have an autoimmune condition or similar to *additional* dose.
[23:07:28] <kuudes> booster doses will/may come to general availability at around 2nd dose + 6 months point

[23:09:33] <kuudes> I got third doses to my parents by recommending them to go to another city and hiding their medical records, so they got their another 1st dose there. they had got astrazeneca back in spring, they now got moderna
[23:11:46] <kuudes> saturn2, for what it is worth, I have indeed tried to get all my dearest ones and the ones who have asked for my help a third dose
[23:12:51] <kuudes> but I am not a doctor; though these days I have grown more radicalized, so I am unsure of if my actions are that rational. but zvi seems to have similar line? ~
[23:13:26] <kuudes> consistently both cdc and local equivalent to cdc have indeed said in their decision memos that third dose is net beneficial and is safe.
[23:14:07] <kuudes> krar, national vaccination expert group is our equivalent to cdc vaccination recommendation decision body
[23:15:12] <kuudes> could be indeed pfizer is the sanest - they have now ceased moderna for males under 30 here and in other nordics I think

Little that followed went right. A White House lawyer determined that possession of the furs and dagger most likely violated the
