[01:08:35] <TheSHAD0W> Howdy.  I'm setting up an unattended informational display.  I'm loading an image from weather underground in a frame and am trying to refresh it every few minutes.  I'm getting a DOMException in refreshing the frame.  Tried disabling security in chrome and it's not working.
[01:08:54] <ljharb> TheSHAD0W: in an iframe?
[01:08:58] <ljharb> TheSHAD0W: how are you refreshing it
[01:09:12] <TheSHAD0W> In a frame, not an iframe.
[01:09:24] <ljharb> like regular frames? those still even work??
[01:09:32] <TheSHAD0W> parent.main_frame.location.reload()
[01:09:36] <ljharb> my frame-based websites from the 2000s don't load anymore
[01:09:38] <ljharb> frames are super ancient
[01:09:45] <TheSHAD0W> (main_frame is the name of the frame.)
[01:09:47] <ljharb> why are you using regular frames?
[01:10:05] <TheSHAD0W> Because it's the first example I came across, and it's working nicely, except not being able to refresh.
[01:10:06] <ljharb> lol this makes me want to make an image map
[01:10:17] <TheSHAD0W> And I don't think switching to iframe will help.
[01:10:31] <ljharb> i expect it will, and it might even be a one-line JS change
[01:10:36] <shan> wait are you trying to refresh the frame or the parent window
[01:10:43] <TheSHAD0W> The frame.
[01:10:43] <ljharb> the frame
[01:10:48] <ljharb> TheSHAD0W: can you make a codesandbox?
[01:10:57] <TheSHAD0W> I used the wrong syntax on the command line, 1 sec.

[01:16:33] <TheSHAD0W> Well, despite disabling security it's still raising an exception on trying to reload.
[01:18:16] <ljharb> you'll get all sorts of those kinds of warnings with frames, because they're deprecated and ancient
[01:18:21] <ljharb> there's lots of reasons to switch to iframe
[01:18:39] <ThePendulum> why do I only now find the timestamp option in the chrome dev tools
[01:19:34] <GreenJello> TheSHAD0W, you want an iframe because you can hide them, so to refresh you add a new hidden iframe, give it some time to load, and then make it visible and remove the old one at the same time
[01:19:49] <TheSHAD0W> ...
[01:19:54] <GreenJello> and you just continue cycling through them

[08:27:30] <sheetjs> there are probably some UI libraries for it, but setInterval or setTimeout is possibly good enough

[08:32:56] <Rockwood> sheetjs, i need a timer clock actually for use in project
[08:33:05] <sickdyd> what's a smart way to divide components in a "shared" folder to avoid having a million unrelated things in it?
[08:33:39] <Rockwood> should i create or use readymade solution?
[08:33:54] <Rockwood> which is good?
[08:33:57] <cis> sickdyd: how do you mean? by category? by function? by name?
[08:34:45] <sickdyd> it's a Next.js project, and we have a bunch of components that are reused in various pages
[08:35:30] <sickdyd> for now we have non shared components in `page-name/ComponentX.tsx` and then the shared ones in `shared/ComponentY.tsx`
[08:35:54] <sickdyd> but it was pointed out that doing like that we will end up with a billion components in `shared`
[08:36:12] <sickdyd> so I was trying to think of a sensible way to organize them somehow
[08:36:30] <sickdyd> (so far I've always chucked them all in `shared`)
[08:37:20] <sickdyd> cis: ^
[08:38:43] <cis> well, they probably fit into categories, so that might be a starting point
[08:39:11] <sickdyd> cis: what kind of categories?

[16:03:58] <silly> the thing it's doing is called "autoboxing"
[16:04:13] <silly> iirc
[16:04:33] <teut> Autoboxing is the automatic conversion that the Java compiler makes between the primitive types and their corresponding object wrapper classes.
[16:04:48] <silly> yes

[16:06:03] <silly> it's undoing the boxing afterwards
[16:06:25] <silly> bracket syntax is called destructuring in this case

[23:08:50] <gde35> I would obviously like to not redownload the json every time as its kinda big but if I [say] make an extra file with a last updated time stamp things end up waiting for each other
[23:09:01] <hassoon> GreenJello: i think your monaco-editor package is fine, it's even newer than mine, but you need a react wrapper or something, i use an angular wrapper called @materia-ui/ngx-monaco-editor that makes monaco-editor resizes and adapts to its container's changes dynamically and on the go
[23:09:09] <hassoon> GreenJello: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@monaco-editor/react
[23:09:21] <gde35> the timestamp wont be checked before the html is loaded, the json wont be loaded before a time stamp is returned

[23:41:47] <babesfla> qswz: I need runtime access to current document size.

AFAIK, document.all.length provides even less resolution as to current size..
[23:41:48] <GreenJello> currentScript?
[23:41:51] <GreenJello> something like that
[23:41:52] <qswz> you can do const el=document.createElement('div');  el.className='my-node'; document.body.append(el) or document.getElementByID('foo').append(el)
