[00:38:42] <acdw> TRS-80 that sounds promising
[00:39:01] <TRS-80> I am sure I will be spamming it in here once I do publish :)
[00:39:03] <acdw> though you wouldn't necessarily /need/ an org-style database ... i suppose unless you want that
[00:39:05] <acdw> ahahah
[00:39:14] <shrysr> TRS-80: sounds cool. i look forward to this.. it would be good to manage contacts.. and improve meaningful 'social interaction' via org mode i think. Yea, i agree that those readme sections that I've found on some projects have been very useful. iirc scimax/jkitchin's approach relies on his org-db package indexing the org files. I think never got scimax-contacts working as I wanted during my scimax days.
[00:39:57] <TRS-80> acdw: no not at all, I just like Org and Emacs and use those tools already to manage a lot of other PIM, so at some point I said why not contacts, too?
[00:40:29] <acdw> aha right
[00:40:31] <acdw> that makes sense
[00:40:46] <acdw> i spose you can also make notes on each person that way, which is useful
[00:41:27] <TRS-80> Yes for example I do put a lot of timestamped metadata into various project headlines, I have CREATED and UPDATED todo states for this purpose.  Or as acdw says, you can simply put whatever you like into the body.
[00:42:14] <TRS-80> but key:value (ala Org Mode PROPERTIES) gets you almost everything you need for a contact (or any other) sort of 'database'
[00:43:30] <TRS-80> next I will work on a 'link' field, which will be a regular Org link from one contact to an Org(anization) they belong to, or a REL(ation) link to any of father, wife, sibling, boss, etc...
[00:44:09] <TRS-80> I'm getting quite excited about the whole thing, and should have a MVP to show off soon enough

[00:45:48] <shrysr> TRS-80: do you use active time stamps for CREATED / UPDATED ? Does every org-heading you add have a created time stamp property?
[00:46:05] <shrysr> i mean in general... not just the contacts aspect
[00:46:27] <TRS-80> shrysr: I wrote a function to handle those specially, so as not to change the active state
[00:47:16] <TRS-80> happy to share if you would find it useful
[00:47:46] <TRS-80> I try and add a CREATED entry to just about every headline nowadays.
[00:48:12] <TRS-80> every new headline I mean.  As I find it gived valuable (timestamped) context.
[00:48:21] <shrysr> sure TRS-80. ty. I just have never figured out.. how to effectively use active versus inactive time stamps. I like having inactive timestamps, and atm - if the headline is made a TODO - a CREATED property is added with active timestamp i think.
[00:48:36] <shrysr> the problem is cluttering of the agenda
[00:49:12] <shrysr> You get an inactive stamp when you complete or on a specific status, and a comment as well. thats what i meant by clutter.
[00:49:45] <TRS-80> I am sorry I guess I mis-spoke.  In my case, both CREATED and UPDATED are considered 'inactive' in terms of Org (e.g., they are like DONE).  But I go one further and make sure these 2 special states do not appear in the headline, only in the LOGBOOOK.
[00:49:59] <TRS-80> so they don't show in agenda
[00:50:01] <TRS-80> yeah
[00:50:44] <TRS-80> I also have like 5 tiers of 'normal' TODO states, plus 2-3 sets of 'special' ones for particular cases.  I'll post those, too.  Give me a moment.

[05:09:04] <Unicorn_Princess> what did i do to deserve this- i mean hi. using the default spacemacs shell layer (which uses ansi-term according to https://develop.spacemacs.org/layers/+tools/shell/README.html, and the value of shell-default-shell is indeed ansi-term), in evil-mode, i can add text to the shell, but if i try to delete it (in insert mode), it complains that the buffer is read-only. if i go into normal mode, backspace works, but always deletes
[05:09:04] <Unicorn_Princess> from the end, no matter where the point is. if i force the buffer out of read-only-mode, using M-x read-only-mode, evil editing commands will /appear/ to work as expected, but the actual text that the shell sees (as opposed to I, the user) will be different, as if it had ignored backspace for example. ..help.

[06:14:36] <acdw> but doing stuff like clocking in and like, uh, .... narrowing to subtree only works on the current heading

[06:19:46] <nnnnn> I see. I'd have to see an example to fully understand, I think.
[06:21:12] <nnnnn> One thing that always bothered me about Org is that you can't set an arbitrary time when marking a task DONE.
[06:22:05] <nnnnn> I'd like to have something like `org-todo-yesterday', but just prompt the user for a date.
[06:23:07] <bpalmer> org-todo-yesterday – is that for adding a task you should have gotten done but haven't yet?
[06:23:57] <acdw> or is that ... "I finished this yesterday" ?
[06:24:13] <nnnnn> For changing the state with yesterday's date.
[06:24:25] <nnnnn> acdw: yes, that's the idea.
[06:24:53] <nnnnn> but it's rather limited. And it doesn't let you set the time portion. Just sets it to 00:00 -1d from today.
[06:24:54] <bpalmer> oh. Wow. Some people finish things on their todo list?
[06:25:03] <bpalmer> What an unusual thing to optimize for.
[06:25:57] <nnnnn> bpalmer: At the very least, something more general would allow one to lie about having finished things on their todo list.

[06:27:50] <nnnnn> I wrote a very crude library which allows executing `org-todo' for arbitrary dates. Too buggy to release and I only really use it on the rare times when I can't get to my computer for some reason and then have to process my todo list later.

[06:30:41] <nnnnn> TRS-80: I just have a command, epoch-todo, which works like `org-todo', but it prompts you for a time. It defaults to DEADLINE, then SCHEDULED times, as default input.
[06:31:00] <nnnnn> There's an org-agenda version as well.
[06:31:33] <TRS-80> I just add something like 'did this few days ago' into the LOGBOOOK note :p

[06:32:00] <TRS-80> as I quite often am marking things done after the fact as I come across them
[06:32:12] <acdw> i just archive my tasks and yeet em somehwere
[06:32:20] <nnnnn> TRS-80: That's one way of dealing with it. Doesn't play nice with repeating tasks, though.
[06:32:43] <TRS-80> I guess if your repeaters are set up right, that shouldn't matter?

[06:35:00] <acdw> repeaters make no ding dang sense i tell ya
[06:35:12] <nnnnn> TRS-80: ++ will shift into the future. So if, say something like a daily habit, hasn't been processed for a couple days. If you mark it DONE, the next habit will be scheduled properly, but the information that it was completed multiple times is lost.
[06:35:54] <TRS-80> OK, I guess if you want to keep logs of all completions.  Usually I just want to get state caught up.

[11:27:08] <pjb> because the custom file already exist, so it's not called.
[11:27:32] <pjb> When you write unit tests, you must have 100% coverage, so you must ensure all the combinations of initial conditions are re-created!
[11:27:51] <hyiltiz> hmm but stringp issue is about the syntax; `unless' shouldn't prevent a syntax error to be thrown, no?
[11:28:18] <hyiltiz> wait I am talking about C-xC-e the sexp in init.el, which loads ALL of the minimal.el
[11:28:57] <pjb> No.  If you want to ignore errors, use ignore-error or condition-case.
[11:29:21] <pjb> C-x C-e evaluates forms.  If subforms are not evaluated, syntax errors won't be detected.
[11:30:03] <pjb> Use byte-compile-file to validate the syntax.

[13:16:02] <ecraven> hm.. for some reason, when I use `url-retrieve' to get an xml page from some rest API, the buffer that then contains the result is *not* correctly interpreted as utf-8.. for example em-dash is shown as \342\200\223 (which *is* the right utf-8 sequence)
[13:16:10] <ecraven> am I doing anything wrong with `url-retrieve' here?
[13:16:18] <ecraven> content type seems to be set correctly: Content-Type: text/xml; charset="UTF-8"

[19:08:34] <TRS-80> I would argue that the Internet started as connecting schools and institutions together, and that is still big part of it today, but I guess you got me there on scale as Internet is almost unfathomable enormous by now.

[22:42:07] <rpav> i don't think those exist, and if they do i don't think they'd do what you want
[22:42:30] <rpav> afaik every line scroll in emacs is "begin" and "end"
[22:42:43] <acdw> what do you want earthToAdam ? rpav: that makes sense
[22:43:22] <earthToAdam> acdw rpav I am looking for a way to enable the so-long-minor-mode when I scroll the buffer and then to revert when I stop.
[22:44:48] <earthToAdam> From initial tests, it appears that this mode actually stops Emacs from stuttering when scrolling through text with very long lines, so I would love to find a way to tie this into a scroll event...
[22:45:22] <rpav> i would also worry about the total round-trip of enable/disable there
[22:46:21] <acdw> oh yeah idk about how to do that..
[22:46:33] <earthToAdam> rpav right now, my Emacs has an epileptic fit, everytime I scroll through a document with images, LaTeX previews or long lines... so, I can live with a little loss in performance, if it helps! :D
[22:46:58] <acdw> i would assume rpav is right, there's probably not a concept of "starting to scroll"/"stopping scrolling"; it's probably more like, "scroll one line up/down" but a lot of those in succession
[22:47:02] <rpav> there is window-scroll-functions but i'm not sure if that would work here
[22:47:37] <earthToAdam> rpav I saw that... it doesn't look like a standard 'hook' though?
[22:47:42] <rpav> assuming it's effective the first "scroll" to so-long-minor-mode, you could set/reset a relatively short timer everytime you get called and once that's up disable
[22:47:50] <acdw> Warning: Do not use this feature to alter the way the window
[22:47:50] <acdw> is scrolled.  It is not designed for that, and such use probably won't
[22:47:50] <acdw> work.
[22:48:00] <rpav> acdw: right but this isn't changing how it's scrolled, per se
[22:48:15] <rpav> it's really changing how anything is displayed
[22:48:20] <acdw> rpav: I think setting a timer makes sense there
[22:48:24] <acdw> you think so? hm, maybe
[22:48:45] <earthToAdam> that's an idea
[22:48:47] <rpav> i think the warning is more like, don't try to update the scroll-position _in_ the callback because probably that will end up recursive

[22:50:09] <earthToAdam> would still need some event to identify whether the buffer was still scrolling or stopped... I suppose this could be coded from scratch with a timer, by checking the current position of the window...?

[22:51:00] <earthToAdam> But I have to believe that after 40+ years of development, this hook already exists... somewhere!
[22:51:01] <rpav> that's the idea behind using a timer
[22:51:28] <rpav> you keep the ball bouncing until something stops, at which time when it falls it does the thing you want
[22:52:11] <earthToAdam> thanks, if I can't find a already-built hook, that sounds like a good approach!

[22:56:11] <rpav> most likely "was it because of computer rooms, rulers and authorities that you came to me?"
[22:56:22] <bpalmer> earthToAdam: perhaps you want to look at C-h f track-mouse RET
[22:56:46] <bpalmer> earthToAdam: this would allow you to manually handle scrolling motions from the trackpad (perhaps)
[22:57:15] <acdw> earthToAdam : https://ttm.sh/iUw.txt maybe try ... this?
[22:57:29] <acdw> it worked a little bit

[23:05:23] <earthToAdam> acdw so it looks like this function automatically cuts out every 1/10th of a second and then gets reactivated if the buffer is still being scrolled?
[23:06:48] <earthToAdam> bpalmer how would you use track-mouse/read-event to determine whether the buffer was currently scrolling?
[23:07:27] <bpalmer> you would manually be scrolling the window in response to mouse events; get events that aren't mouse events, you stop looping.
[23:07:43] <bpalmer> I"m not sure precisely how well this would work, but it gives you tight control.
[23:07:50] <acdw> earthToAdam : yeah i guess so.. you could change the timeout to something higher... maybe .25? or so
[23:10:03] <acdw> another fun fact: lui-mode buffers like circe chats prompt you if you try to change the major mode...so i got a tone of prompts

[23:23:58] <acdw> that might be easier actually... replace the thing after `until' to so-long-minor-mode, then call (so-long-minor-mode) and run #'turn-off-so-long-minor-mode in the timer
