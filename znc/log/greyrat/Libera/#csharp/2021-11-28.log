[14:28:12] <Jamy2> Hi! I'm starting out with C#, and have gotten stuck with something that I just can't figure out. I have a class method, IsDone(), that's passed as a reference into a list a list of "callbacks" that's periodically called. The problem is that the method always just returns the initial value of _isDone, it doesn't pick up that it has been changed. Any
[14:28:12] <Jamy2> idea what's causing it? https://pastebin.com/yLe6Qc8Z
[14:28:33] <sysRPL> i would think that if someone is lying to me about a cashier check using one of the most well know scams, then it's okay for me to lie back to them that they can send the check to my omployer ... THE FBI
[14:31:38] <MatthiasVance> sysRPL: Yeah idk this stuff is tricky

[18:21:53] <snake> hello! my friend wants to get into programming. I think csharp would be a cool beginner language to learn, but i want him to use the command line to build and to create his own files and stuff
[18:22:06] <snake> is there a way to do that? is there a tutorial?
[18:23:12] <snake> oh i found csc maybe that will work
[18:23:24] <bpmedley> snake : https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/dotnet/hello-world-tutorial/intro
[18:23:45] <snake> bpmedley, thankyou!
[18:24:02] <canton7> snake, don't use csc on its own - if you insist on using the command line, using 'dotnet'
[18:24:16] <snake> ok thankyou
[18:24:27] <canton7> But a lot of the value of languages like C# comes from having a rich IDE experience
[18:27:43] <snake> yeah true
[18:27:52] <snake> the other language i considered was java
[18:28:10] <snake> at uni we learned java but only used a text editor and commandline for the whole first semester
[18:28:22] <bpmedley> snake : I like the ecosystem and language options of C# better than java.
[18:28:43] <snake> i just dont want him to become stuck in the ide bubble :V or something
[18:28:52] <snake> but maybe im coddling too much :V
[18:29:02] <bpmedley> snake : I rarely use IDEs when I code C#.  I use vim.
[18:29:12] <snake> whoa, that's hardcore
[18:29:14] <bpmedley> For personal stuff..

[18:42:26] <canton7> snake, surely it's a lot easier to learn when you have intellisense etc? You don't need to remember method names or orders of parameters etc -- that's all just there. And you don't need to compile before learning what you've done wrong - it's highlighted in red as soon as you make a mistake
[18:43:39] <snake> canton7, yeah
[18:43:48] <snake> hmm

[20:07:18] <viaSanctus> ok, this is an old one, but still not clear to me...should i pick xunit now over mstest or nunit?
[20:08:18] <bpmedley> viaSanctus : We use xunit in our tests
[20:08:50] <viaSanctus> so far so good?
[20:10:06] <bpmedley> Yes, we've had great results so far.
[20:23:29] *** ern_ is now known as ern
[20:24:44] <xb0o2> I'd suggest taking your pick out of xunit and nunit

[20:34:59] <blez> VS2019 works better than VS2022 on Win11/M1/Parallels
[20:47:08] <canton7> viaSanctus, I still prefer nunit over xunit, but I've got projects using both
[20:47:57] <viaSanctus> went for xunit, never used it before, but doesnt seem much different so far
[20:48:13] <canton7> xunit is more opinionated and a bit more restricted
[20:48:18] <viaSanctus> ignorance _is_ bliss :)
[20:48:36] <canton7> no Assert.DoesNotThrow or Assert.Multiple or Assert.That, etc
[20:52:22] <xb0o2> That's why I much prefer xunit :)
[20:52:45] <canton7> You prefer it because it's missing things?
[20:53:22] <xb0o2> Err, I wouldn't phrase it like that, but yes.
[20:53:37] <viaSanctus> i can imagine a lot of things id prefer if it missed some things :p

[20:54:34] <xb0o2> I mean for the most part it makes very little difference but I do prefer the philosophy of xunit
[20:55:03] <sonny> `char.IsLetterOrDigit(c)` -- I assumed char is a reserved word in c#, what is happening here? <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.textreader?view=net-6.0>
[20:55:54] <xb0o2> It's calling the static `IsLetterOrDigit` method on `char`
[20:56:20] <xb0o2> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.char.isletterordigit?view=net-6.0
[20:57:12] <sonny> so it's a typo? it should be Char not char
[20:57:33] <canton7> 'char' is a C# keyword which aliases the 'System.Char' type
[20:57:40] <canton7> same with string/String, int/Int32, etc
