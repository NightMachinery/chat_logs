[00:00:10] <droid3> then i just worry getting the font the same as the word processor font before i generated the latex .svg pictures to embed.
[00:00:16] <mornfall> again, books are not done in word processors; there are specialized programs for that
[00:00:37] <droid3> That a solution if i can do that as a work around from learning latex/tex editor and writting it completely with those editors.

[00:02:58] <mornfall> it's possible to generate svg from tex, but you'll have to write a program to do it (takes a few hundred lines)
[00:03:28] <mornfall> it's also going to be an incredible pain in the backside
[00:03:30] <droid3> mornfall like what if its not latex/tex symbols to write a book what else would you need then a good word process program??? Word processor programs allow you so many things most of the time you need to embed pictures , set margins/padding for the whole book , set font/style for book , line spaceing for book ,...etc nearly any functionality you need to write a complete book without latex/tex special symbols can be done in a good word
[00:03:30] <droid3> processor
[00:05:07] <droid3> Now there maybe special program to make doing these task easier but if your already have good word processing skill i dont see the need for special programs?
[00:06:21] <cherim> This may go on forever (it is actually going on for quite some time already)
[00:06:37] <cherim> Contact a publisher and ask them about the procedure
[00:06:39] <droid3> There are many good templates for the copyright page , the chapter pages , and other standard page you want to add to parts of your book that one can import in a word document just fine.
[00:06:44] *** Quits: wootehfoot (~wootehfoo@user/wootehfoot) (Quit: Leaving)
[00:07:06] <cherim> You will learn that no serious publisher will have any use for your hand-made formatting
[00:07:34] <cherim> They have their own internal technological processes into which your "word with pictures" will not integrate in the least
[00:08:20] <cherim> They will say: 1) you write using the TeX style files we give you, all the formatting will be done by us. Only provide the text and commects on preliminary typeset result
[00:08:43] <droid3> Ya i have to contact them for the question on latex but i have already seen from a lot of publishers website examples of them writting the book/starting out to write the book completely in word process. And saying they want one pdf generated from the word processor application for the cover , the other pdf generate for the internals of the book. And to use some of the templates for chapters, copyright ,...etc to aid in development given on
[00:08:43] <droid3> there site for download.
[00:09:35] <mornfall> when you send a word document to a publisher, that's a manuscript, not the typesetting for the book
[00:09:57] <droid3> But ya all have to ask them eventually about the latex/tex and math book option. But it seem it wont matter how you do it just so long as its pdf for the cover and pdf for the internals. However for customization it be easier if one could write the whole thing self contained in a latex/tex editor.
[00:10:59] <cherim> 2) You can contact not a publisher but a typography. They will print whatever you send, be it even .jpg images of pages
[00:11:51] <droid3> But i not get with latex/tex editors so word processor and carefully taken latex images embed is the only way i can do it. Except once i do its not customizable because its pictures not a whole latex/tex editor document
[00:12:19] <droid3> Ya i was going to do it the self publishing route if i do it someday.
[00:12:40] <droid3> So i only need a publishing company for the printing and possible shipping if it got popular parts.
[00:12:44] <mornfall> long story short, do whatever you want, you get to keep both pieces when it turns out it's broken
[00:13:34] <cherim> But most of all, make sure a publisher really wants a book from you. This is actually what the first book I read on LaTeX ended with. "You now can submit a manuscript satisfying AMS publishing standards. But does AMS really want to arrange publishing any book by you?"
[00:14:20] <droid3> ya but its alot of work to actually fix /generate new latex and embed it for the whole book. Rather then just go into the latex document and tweak a formula or font and everything is all set. But i guess that the only option when not will to learn latex/tex editors.
[00:15:16] <droid3> I just cannt imagine before latex/tex how math books where pumped out if it was all manual typesetting. And why the typesetting wasnt part of the standard typesetting font in any program. Why was it a specialize area with need for specialized programs.
[00:15:26] <droid3> such as latex/tex editors
[00:15:37] <cherim> Typesetting existed before any programs or computers
[00:16:05] <cherim> You submit a handwritten manuscript with underline for bold, wavy underline for italic etc.
[00:16:31] <cherim> A person puts metal letters together by hand and centers them with special springs, etc.
[00:18:04] <droid3> So is this still done today if i say forget the pictures of latex and just take pictures of my hand written proof or drawing. And just say can when you print/publish this thing can you convert the hand written proof to latex/tex
[00:18:35] <droid3> Is that a service because that might be the easiest way to go without headaches of embedding all your math latex images
[00:18:42] <cherim> Yes, this is the most sane thing you said on the subject so far
[00:19:02] <cherim> You can arrange this with a publisher for extra fees sometimes
[00:19:26] <cherim> I am not sure how many respectable publishers still do this though
[00:19:43] <droid3> So is it like you write the word processor novel part and just embed the picture of your proofs and tell them to convert the word / image document to a latex/tex document
[00:20:28] <cherim> You will return to this embed the picture of a formula whatever people say I guess

[00:21:22] <cherim> You can do this, it will be counted in the same bin as handwritten manyscript. I.e. somebody will do all the formatting from scratch based on your draft
[00:21:43] <droid3> well you have to embed the pictures of your math proof at the proper point of the book. For them to beable to see it convert it to latex. Placing them in the document where you want them that is initial the picture let them know where each proof is suppose to go.

[00:22:01] <droid3> when they convert it over in latex that is
[00:22:27] <cherim> People who are responsible for typesetting know where to put the pictures (actually, better than most authors)
[00:22:38] <cherim> It's their job
[00:23:40] *** Joins: texasmusicinstru (~Rheanna@218.78.105.67)
[00:24:01] <droid3> Ok i see so if i was going to do this i just embed the pictures of the handwritten proof of them or i put one liner embed pictures of latex images in my document of all of this. And just tell them to take the word document with latex pictures/pictures of my math symbol drawings.
[00:24:18] <droid3> And just convert the word document to a latex/tex document
[00:24:38] <droid3> Ya that be the most sane thing to do let an expert latex/tex guy handle that part.
[00:25:09] <cherim> So the situation is binary. Either you work inthe framework the publisher provides (almost surely that will be LaTeX with some given preamble), and this counts as formatting; or you do whatever else (only matters that the text is readable) and they convert to their format from zero
[00:25:34] <droid3> Then once its in latex just like a word document one can generate with the program a pdf for the cover and pdf for the internals to print
[00:26:14] <droid3> curious if you tell them to convert it into latex/tex your word document can you get a proof copy of the latex/tex document before its render as a pdf ?

[03:14:17] <buster> heh yeah. " the only simple rings that are a finite-dimensional vector space over the real numbers are rings of matrices over either the real numbers, the complex numbers, or the quaternions." full circle.
[03:15:11] <johnkeats6> buster, i think i get that. if V is a simple module of R, you can fix some nonzero v in V and consider the R-linear map x |-> vx. it's surjective (since the image would be an ideal). the kernel is a right ideal of R. it's maximal since R/ker ~= V is simple. if there were a bigger proper ideal containing ker, by third isomorphism you'd get a proper thing inside R/ker
[03:15:44] <johnkeats6> we can switch back to left actions and left ideals
[03:16:19] <johnkeats6> so the idea seems to be:
[03:17:59] <johnkeats6> take a C-algebra automorphism phi : M_{n x n}(C) --> M_{n x n}(C). you have two (left) M_{n x n}(C)-module structures on C^n. one is the usual (A, x) |-> Ax, the other one is (A, x) |-> phi(A)x
[03:18:37] <johnkeats6> now clearly C^n is simple under both structures

[03:49:15] <johnkeats6> buster, at least assuming this mess i'm happy with the dirac stuff. the matrices satisfy the rules for a clifford algebra, and so generate a 16-dimensional thing, and since 4x4 = 16 the clifford algebra is isomorphic to the M_{4x4}(C) (by an isomorphism mapping the ith generator to gamma^i). since the Lambda^mu_nu gamma^nu also satisfy that, there's another isomorphism, and hence an automorphism (which must be inner) relating
[03:49:15] <johnkeats6> the 2 sets of dirac matrices
[03:50:50] <johnkeats6> i.e. exactly the Lambda^mu_nu gamma^nu = S(Lambda) gama^mu S(Lambda)^{-1} thing. i guess though it's not obvious that you can pick this S function to be a rep of the lorentz group

[08:36:47] <greenbagels> is the question like: in (1h47m + 11m), the lantern was only on for 1h47m?
[08:37:03] <greenbagels> so how much would it run (or be idle) in 24 hours?
[08:37:17] <greenbagels> (if you assume the same percentage time is idle vs running)
[08:37:55] <mihael> `Fuel oil burner Idle time: 11mins Running time: 1hour 47 mins. How much total running time in 24 hours`? You explained it well
[08:38:20] <greenbagels> ok then yes, it's what qergle and specing said
[08:38:39] <greenbagels> you first find the percentage (or proportion, as you might hear it sometimes called) of time that it is running
[08:38:39] <mihael> greenbagels why did we need to divide 107/(107+11)?
[08:38:55] <greenbagels> because 107/(107+11) is (running minutes) / (total minutes)
[08:39:13] <greenbagels> which you assume is the constant percentage that the oil burner will be running out of its total "used time"
[08:39:46] <greenbagels> or to put it in another perspective
[08:40:11] <greenbagels> for every minute that the lantern is used in total, 107/(107+11) of that time is spent running
[08:40:37] <greenbagels> and 1 - 107 / (107+11) of that time is spent being idle
[08:40:48] <greenbagels> (that second number will turn out to be 11 / (107+11), which should make sense)

[08:41:46] <mihael> 107/(107+11) * 24 = 21.76, that means it is running for 21.76 hours?
[08:41:47] *** Quits: texasmusicinstru (~Rheanna@218.78.109.69) (Remote host closed the connection)
[08:41:54] <greenbagels> yep
[08:42:10] <greenbagels> 21.76 out of the 24 hours, it will be running; the rest of the (24 - 21.76) hours it will be idle
[08:43:41] <greenbagels> think of it like rates with speeds and distances

[08:44:42] <mihael> Thanks greenbagels . Though to be honest I don't really get the formula
[08:45:17] <mihael> specially the "for every minute that the lantern is used in total, 107/(107+11) of that time is spent running" part . . .
[08:45:23] <greenbagels> mihael: think of it like this; if you drive 60 km in 1 hour, for every minute, you travel 1 km
[08:46:04] *** Quits: roadt__ (~roadt@36.7.132.126) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[08:46:54] <greenbagels> similarly, if you are running for 107 minutes for every 118 minutes of total burner time, for every minute the burner is on, you're actually running for 107 / 118 minutes
[08:46:57] <mornfall> the lantern runs 91% of the time
[08:47:16] <qergle> if a person sits for 2 minutes then stands for 1 minute, repeat. then the percent sitting is 2/3 and standing is 1/3. in 24 hours, (2/3)*24 is spent sitting.
[08:47:22] * greenbagels just realizes he hasnt used a percentage once
[08:47:37] <greenbagels> mornfall is master of pedagogy
[08:48:39] <mornfall> 91% of a minute is a bit under 55 seconds, 91% of an hour is around 55 minutes, 91% of 118 minutes is 107 minutes and 91% of a day is 21 hours 45 minutes (all numbers approximate)

[08:52:10] <mihael> so 118m is the total burner time, it includes both running and idle states
[08:52:40] <mornfall> well i don't suppose a lantern can be both burning and idle at the same time
[08:52:43] <mihael> out of that 118m, 107/118 is spent running while 118/107 is spent idle. Here we get the percentages
[08:53:02] <qergle> 107/118 is spent running and 11/118 is spent idle
[08:53:04] <mornfall> 11/118 is idle
[08:53:16] <mihael> oh sorry, yeah, 11/118*
[08:53:20] <mornfall> they have to add up to 100%
[08:54:34] <mihael> ah, I think I'm starting to get a clearer picture for it now
[08:54:40] <mihael> Thanks mornfall qergle

[09:19:23] <mihael> thanks, I'll give it a read
[09:26:05] <isekaijin> I think I finally managed to trace the source of my woes when TAing “math for economists”. Engineering students have to take a course in which they are taught the basics of writing proofs. Like, how to use quantifiers and stuffs. Economics students do not have to take any similar course.
[09:26:28] <isekaijin> So of course they struggle to understand things like “proving forall x. P(x) requires dealing with the abstract general case, but proving its negation only requires giving a single concrete countereaxample”.
[09:26:58] <nagefire> I would think that econ students would need proof techniques more than engineering students
[09:27:14] <nagefire> *need more of a background in proofs than engineering students
[09:27:53] <isekaijin> If this is the case, then something needs to be fixed about their curriculum.
[09:29:14] <isekaijin> I know that I did not have to take any courses in writing proofs when I studied engineering. (But I studied at a different university, where neither engineering nor economics students nor anyone really has to ever write a proof.)

[09:32:53] <isekaijin> In any case, the point is that it is too cruel to require someone to learn to write proofs when they are taking multivariate calculus. Either they know how to write proofs and you make use of their ability, or they don't know how to write proofs and you design the course around that fact.

[10:15:43] <nagefire> isekaijin as a TA for multivar calculus, I have to disagree
[10:15:53] <Ethos> I dont think so but some notes i have are confusing me
[10:15:56] <greenbagels> At the very least I would expect them both to require some very basic logic
[10:16:11] <greenbagels> Ethos: you don't even know if f is differentiable, so no

[10:28:30] <Ethos> Yeah nagefire i think we should have something like f'(x) = f(x)*g(x) or something

[10:30:30] <Ethos> This question arised solving a differential equation
[10:30:43] <nagefire> Yeah, I guess you can't draw too many conclusions about derivatives based on such limits
[10:30:43] <isekaijin> The basic idea is that, even though the e^{-x} factor decreases, the sin(e^x) factor oscillates so much faster and faster that f'(x) does not decrease overall.
[10:31:24] <greenbagels> i feel like this intuition is not hte entire picture right?
[10:31:37] <greenbagels> it doesnt work the same for any polynomial instead of expoenential

[10:32:05] <Ethos> Not sure about other exponents
[10:32:12] <greenbagels> but i mean in general the idea is 1/f(x) sin(f(x))

[10:40:54] <greenbagels> isekaijin: it's not just that the growth rate of the function outside the sine is the same as that inside, but the inside makes it oscillate faster to compensate
[10:41:19] <greenbagels> the growth rate of the function itself is important, right? (it's not just an intuitive matter of "horizontal vs vertical stretching")
[10:41:31] <isekaijin> Yes.

[10:42:20] <isekaijin> In sin(g(x)) / f(x), the function g(x) has to grow so fast that the increased oscillation rate of sin(g(x)) overcompensates the damping by the f(x)^{-1} factor.

[19:16:54] <cherim> Of course that's to low

[19:17:29] <Simplar> then worst case for two pairs out of each 4 is that there is only one way to group each 4 into a pair
[19:17:39] <Simplar> cause two won't be friends with two others
[19:18:40] <cherim> If I take 3 people from different groups and the 4th any remaining, will there be two pairs?
[19:19:11] <Simplar> cherim: might not be
[19:19:13] <cherim> People who are unique representatives of their groups will have no pair available

[19:21:13] <cherim> Yes, pigeonhole.

[19:41:50] <Simplar> because only two of these won't be friends with one another

[19:42:18] <Simplar> wait

[19:42:28] <Simplar> and 6 pairs of people is 12 people
[19:42:39] <Simplar> and friendship relationship is 2-sided
[19:42:52] <Simplar> means they are mutually friends if they are friends
[19:43:21] <cherim> You can view this as a graph. There are 12 vertices, and an edge is (mutual) frienship. How many edges are needed?

[22:41:33] <cherim> If you also count the empty set (0 and 0, both even), then it's 70. For n even and n odd numbers in A the answer is binom(2n, n), which is binom(8, 4)=70 here. Subtract 1 if empty is not allowed.
