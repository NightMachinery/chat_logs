[01:04:18] <MetaNova> I'm not sure why both exist
[01:04:42] <GuiToris> I can read IPA, the either one should be sIt sound when the other is sEAt, I hope it makes sense

[01:07:01] <LimeOn> that is a lot!
[01:07:26] <GuiToris> MetaNova, in theory the strong form is used at the end of the sentence. like : 'let it bee'. and the weak form is in the middle of the sentence. 'I will be ready soon'

[01:22:28] <LjL> GuiToris, i hear no difference in those soundfiles except for the very slight descending tone as mentioned, but generally speaking, many short, basic english words *can* have two different pronunciations depending on whether or not they're stressed in a sentence, and speakers don't always necessarily perceive the difference because it's kinda just part of the prosody. take "to" before a verb or noun phrase, versus stressed "the place i will go TO"
[01:24:09] <GuiToris> I think I can easily make a difference between 'too' and 'tuh', but this 'be' is different
[01:24:51] <GuiToris> if you shuffled the files, I couldn't tell you which is which
[01:28:03] <LjL> i don't think those files are a good example of the difference though

[01:29:29] <GuiToris> I don't know how I should pronounce them
[01:30:44] <LjL> GuiToris, i think not, i think they're slightly different vowels, but in all honesty the difference between /ɜ/ and schwa is something you should discuss with someone with more of a clue than me because those are very similar vowel to me, a poor native speaker of a language with just 7 vowels
[01:30:57] <LjL> (5 in unstressed syllables)
[01:31:20] <LjL> but also, haven't we ascertained that some of the pronunciation sample in that dictionary are kind of... out there?
[01:31:51] <LjL> not saying those two of "were" are bad necessarily, but for example i do think the two "be"'s are basically the same except for tone, so i'm not sure what they're trying to show
[01:32:34] <GuiToris> I showed you a sample from another dictionary yesterday
[01:32:44] <GuiToris> if you are referring to 000
[01:33:09] <LjL> GuiToris, i hadn't actually clicked on https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/be_1?q=be though, as so i had been basing my assumption on your "sIt vs sEAt" vowels (a difference i don't hear in those sample), but that's not what the IPA there says: both "i"'s have a dot, which means they're both /i/, the vowel in "seat", except one is marked as long and one isn't

[01:56:27] <GuiToris> are you talking about "be"? yes, I noticed I made a mistake earlier
[01:57:15] <LjL> if you look at some earlier versions of the page like the very first one https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Help:IPA/English&oldid=812853789 it calls them "reduced vowels" and it claims that /i/ is really "either /iː/ or /ɪ/", meaning that ad-hoc short /i/ sound doesn't necessarily exist phonetically, but is there to show that in some words, some speakers will make a full /i:/ and others will reduce it to /I/. that goes for the final vowel in "happy" a
[01:57:15] <LjL> t least. i'd assume the dictionary is extending the phenomenon to stressed vs unstressed forms of "be", but given all of that, that doesn't necessarily mean there is an *actual difference* between them (or if there is purely a length difference... how do you even measure it? an unstressed word will necessarily be shorter than a stressed one in the first place)
[01:57:46] <LjL> GuiToris, yes i am, but i'm not talking about your mistake, i'm talking about the choice of distinguishing between /i:/ and /i/ in English, which is not straightforward

[02:00:40] <LjL> or you do, it really depends on your dialect :P that's why a phoneMic transcription sometimes has to come up with ad-hoc uses of IPA to indicate phonemes that are realized differently in different dialects. the thing gets confusing when the *ways* they are realized are actually, themselves, phonemes in the language... but in those cases, you're saying: "okay, in THIS position, it could be either /i:/ or /I/, and so i'm writing it /i/, and you figure it out"
[02:01:39] <LjL> but then the dictionary gives you /bi:/ and /bi/ and then the pronunciation samples only actually differ in length and tone (and in a minuscule amount, by that)... so i think they must be a bit confused, too ;P

[09:36:21] <rapier> thank you, LuisP18 
[09:36:52] <rapier> the form to use adverb is it always subject + adverb + main verb + object?
[09:37:03] <LuisP18> but the others are possible

[09:40:51] <rapier> have/had*
[09:41:07] <LuisP18> it just comes down to natural phrasing

[20:23:19] <Shariff> Hi there!
[20:24:10] *** Joins: geli (~gelignite@55d44612.access.ecotel.net)
[20:25:31] <Shariff> I'm trying to find a different word for collection. I'm designing a database where the word collection could be used for different things: 1. a set of items I bought; 2. A box of items I bought, which would be 1 of the items in number 1. .. I was looking into agglomeration, as a word for my collection of all the movies/tvshows on disc I have collected, borrowed, lent, sold, want to have. Would agglomeration be a good word 
[20:25:31] <Shariff> for that or is there a better one?

[20:34:31] <bintober> what's the different between a box of items and a set of items
[20:34:41] <bintober> why not boxCollection and setCollection
[20:35:43] <bintober> Shariff: ^^
[20:36:03] <Shariff> Sorry, thanks for pointing it out
[20:36:50] <bintober> no need to apologize :)
[20:36:57] <Shariff> A collection could be "All the things I own/borrow/sell/etc" But it could also be The Marvel Universe Collection.. which would be a subset - a single or a few items within the "Things I own".. etc :)
[20:37:20] <bintober> i mean theyre still collections
[20:37:28] <Shariff> Yes, but the meaning is different
[20:38:03] <StayHungry> Shariff: area, scope?
[20:38:03] <Shariff> One is a collection of movies (digital or physical). The other is a set of SKUs (purchasable items from a store)
[20:40:53] <Shariff> Or am I simply making this too complicated?
[20:46:49] <StayHungry> Shariff: go iteratively, i.e. start simple and tweak as needed
[20:47:05] <Shariff> Thanks!
[20:49:18] <StayHungry> Shariff: geen dank, comrade, have a nice evening :)
[20:49:28] <Shariff> Jij ook! :D
