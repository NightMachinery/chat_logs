[00:17:19] <CuriousErnestBro> They gave us 4 conditional probabilities and told us to derive the joint
[00:18:17] <CuriousErnestBro> argument why p(t1) is nonzero: p(s2|t1) = p(s2,t1)p(t1) so since the first is nonzero, p(t1) must be nonzero
[00:18:25] *** Quits: qbt (~edun@user/edun) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[00:18:49] <greenbagels> yeah p(A|B) only makes sense if p(B) is nonzero, so if p(s2|t1) is well-defined, etc.
[00:19:15] <greenbagels> which means the conditionsf or bayes' theorem holds, so what you have is true

[05:30:58] <Fangs> the map going from V*(x)W to linear maps is fairly easy. if you have mu (x) w, then its the linear map that sends v to mu(v)w, where mu: V -> R is a functional
[05:32:08] <Fangs> if you choose a basis for V, say {e_i} then you can define delta_i(e_j) = \delta_{ij} the kroncehker delta (idk how to spell their name) as a sort of basis for V*(x)W

[05:33:14] <[itchyjunk]> i guess so
[05:33:36] <Fangs> so given A: V -> W, write for each e_i the following A(e_i) = w_i, and so in general A(\sum_{i} a^i e_i) = sum a^i  A(e_i)= sum a^i w_i
[05:34:06] <Fangs> so really you can send A to \sum a^i \delta_{i} w_i
[05:34:36] <Fangs> PlanckWalk: was wondering if you know if there's a way to do this without choosing a basis for e_i
[05:34:40] <Fangs> for V*
[05:35:08] <Fangs> I don't think its possible... I can use \delta_v(v) = 1, but then we don't know what \delta_v(w) is, and if you define it to be zero, that's not well defined
[05:35:40] <Fangs> was wondering maybe I can send A to \sum_{v in V} \delta_v (x) A(v), where delta_v(v) = 1 and 0 if v =/= w
[05:35:42] <Fangs> this feels odd

[05:43:21] <XCode> is it possible to get the code from the pdf because there few background material that I wrote in my thesis that I would like to use for my PhD thesis.
[05:43:46] <qergle> you mean pdf→latex?

[05:47:10] <qergle> is there a math-specific ocr, like a tesseract-latex that scans for math markup and turns to ascii macros?
[05:47:18] <cherim> Maybe those don't qualify as "background material that I wrote in my thesis"
[05:47:58] <qergle> for your PhD thesis you should write an OCR engine that rescues the LaTeX of your MsC thesis.
[05:48:48] <zacts> I want to write math tutorials eventually kind of like the perldoc tutorials.
[05:49:27] <qergle> Then lose your PhD thesis and for your postdoc work write an improved OCR engine.
[05:49:35] <qergle> You can make a career out of correcting your failures
[05:50:18] <Fangs> cherim: its an exercise in etingoff btw (and somewhat consequently also a HW assignment)
[05:50:51] <Fangs> the HW say the word 'natural' but didn't say 'natural means defined without choose a basis' but etingoff does
[05:51:35] <Fangs> I still think you can't write down the explicit element in V* (x) W without at least choose a basis for V*

[08:18:37] <Fangs> loopspace: page 5 of the pdf, look at the homotopy involving the suspension of f

[08:47:38] <Fangs> loopspace: well in the definition of H, you can't have both lines have positive 'speeds' (the coeff infront of t)
[08:49:06] <Fangs> loopspace: I think you can easily choose t for the first line and (1-t) for the second and you'd have to adjust where you place your s

[12:51:28] <qergle> Simplar: that's right
[12:51:32] <qergle> want to see my solution?
[12:51:41] <Simplar> Yep! Always want to learn simplier ways :)
[12:52:44] <qergle> we have cos(π/4+α)=3/5=(sqrt(2)/2)*cos(α)-(sqrt(2)/2)*sin(α)
[12:52:47] <qergle> and
[12:52:59] <qergle> we have cos(π/4-α)=4/5=(sqrt(2)/2)*cos(α)+(sqrt(2)/2)*sin(α)
[12:53:33] <qergle> adding the two we have 7/5 = sqrt(2)*cos(α) -> cos(α)=(7/5)/sqrt(2)≈0.9899
[12:54:38] <Simplar> 0__0
[12:55:17] <qergle> the -4/5 case is discounted because of the restriction on α (that one makes cos(α)≈-0.1414)
[12:55:31] <Simplar> That's the way without a quadratic equation?
[12:55:40] <riv> what's wrong with quadratics?
[12:55:55] <riv> you could just do cos(pi/4 - asin(3/5))

[12:56:13] <Simplar> Respect :"D
[12:56:28] <Simplar> I've noticed a curious thing, by the way
[12:57:17] <Simplar> The bisector from the right angle of a right triangle will be closer to the acute angle of that right triangle that's more acute than the other, and the median will be closer to the angle which is less acute than the other.

[17:26:48] <pikapika> gulzar, https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9efdc616072ef4a4b360be791ad915cee59bfed0
[17:27:19] <pikapika> gulzar, least squares is a way to fit a solution when there are more data points than unknowns
[17:27:40] <pikapika> A plane as you note can be computed from three points
[17:27:55] <pikapika> However you have more points available for your plane, so you might want to do a least squares fit
[17:28:01] <int-e> [itchyjunk]: you're almost certainly making this too complicated. start with |uv| = |u||v|...
[17:28:39] <[itchyjunk]> i assumed z = (a + ib) , w = (u+iv) and computed the things
[17:28:50] <[itchyjunk]> i get that thing above
[17:28:54] <[itchyjunk]>  my lhs looks like sqrt((u^2 + v^2) (a^2 + b^2)) and my rhs looks like sqrt(a^2 + b^2) sqrt(u^2 + v^2)
[17:28:57] <riv> if xy are real and positive then yes sqrt(xy) = sqrt(x) sqrt(y)
[17:29:10] <gulzar> pikapika: what will that give me?    As of now the worst case is that both the planes and normal are on either end of each other.
[17:29:18] <pikapika> gulzar, and remember you have to first normalize the two equations before the signed distance computation
[17:29:19] <[itchyjunk]> ah so both real and positives were necessary! think i vaguely remember thing
[17:29:33] <int-e> [itchyjunk]: oh I'm probably confused about which problem you're tackling right now
[17:29:35] <pikapika> ie choose a sign convention
[17:29:36] <[itchyjunk]> i remember thinking it always held and int-e giving an example of it not holding
[17:29:37] <riv> if they are both negative it fails
[17:29:49] <riv> sqrt(-1 * -1) = sqrt(1) = 1
[17:29:57] <riv> sqrt(-1) * sqrt(-1) = i * i = -1
[17:29:58] <pikapika> gulzar, that will give you a normal that takes into account all the points, rather than just any three random points
[17:30:13] <[itchyjunk]> int-e, https://ibb.co/J7BMfRw 4 d) but i didn't remember the property |uv| = |u||v| so was proving it in hopes of remembering it
[17:30:21] <gulzar> pikapika: "choose" in the sense? If a is postiive for both then the way you told about signed dsitance should work?
[17:30:22] *** Quits: oxum (~oxum@106.203.195.217) (Remote host closed the connection)
[17:30:31] <riv> if one is positive and one is negative it works too
[17:30:32] <[itchyjunk]> riv, ah right. thats a nice example
[17:30:43] <[itchyjunk]> oh it only fails when both negative?
[17:30:46] <riv> yeah
[17:30:48] <int-e> [itchyjunk]: ah. well, yes, you have sqrt(uv) = sqrt(u)sqrt(v) for *real* u,v >= 0
[17:30:48] <[itchyjunk]> hadn't noticed!
[17:30:51] <riv> why does it fail when both are negative
[17:30:54] <int-e> [itchyjunk]: (different u and v)
[17:31:01] <pikapika> gulzar, because ax+by+cz-d=0 and -ax-by-cz+d=0 are both the same equation
[17:31:12] <pikapika> each will give opposing signed distances
[17:31:20] <pikapika> so we have to choose a sign convention first
[17:31:26] <[itchyjunk]> because i^2 = -1 ?
[17:31:29] <pikapika> you could for example choose the convention that a is always positive
[17:31:40] <pikapika> so if a is negative in your planes equation you multiply it whole by -1
[17:31:41] <[itchyjunk]> something to do with i not caring about something
[17:31:42] <riv> sqrt(z) is the inverse of z^2, z^2 doubles the argument(angle) of a complex number
[17:31:51] <gulzar> ah ok, so if a is always positive then your logic works. That's enough for me
[17:31:53] <riv> so sqrt halves the argument of a complex number
[17:32:08] <gulzar> pikapika: so finally how to get the least quared normal?
[17:32:15] <pikapika> I will have to look that up
[17:32:15] <riv> but argument loops around, because it's an angle
[17:32:23] <riv> so half of 0 is different to half of 2 pi
[17:32:23] <int-e> [itchyjunk]: your sqrt((u^2 + v^2) (a^2 + b^2)) and sqrt(a^2 + b^2) sqrt(u^2 + v^2) only involve real numbers
[17:32:24] <pikapika> But in the meanwhile you can use the normal from the random three points
[17:32:29] <riv> even though 0 = 2 pi
[17:32:33] <gulzar> pikapika: other way is if possible linear transformation of the point to the normal and then check the signed distance
[17:32:47] <[itchyjunk]> int-e, right! in this case, they are equal and hence proved

[19:48:00] <Z-module> but really, you should keep in mind that a function f being differentiable (on say R) *only* really means that for each real x,   lim_{h -> 0} ((f(x + h) - f(x))/h   exists. It has nothing inherently to do with knowing a "formula" for f and doing a symbolic computation on that, to get a new formula that gives f' everywhere.
[19:48:10] <greenbagels> Guest748: think about the fundamental theorem of calculus; you can derive how derivatives act on definite integrals from this
[19:48:28] <Z-module> That latter view is how most calculcus courses leave people thinking, because they generally only deal with very nicely behaved functions. It's *far* from the general case.

[22:34:53] <newpy> oh right b/c it's binomial
[22:35:19] <cherim> Variance of one indicator variable is p-p^2=p(1-p), variance of the sum is np(1-p).
[22:35:55] <cherim> Can also sum the series here, but differentiating twice is more work
[22:36:21] <cherim> Like sum_{k=0}^n k binom(n, k) p^k (1-p)^{n-k} = d/dx (xp+1-p)^n |_{x=1} = np (xp+1-p)^{n-1} |_{x=1} = np but with d^2/dx^2

[22:38:09] <cherim> Which is (xp+1-p)^n
[22:38:41] <cherim> If you differentiate by x term-wise, x^k becomes kx^{k-1} which gives you the needed k factor for mean
[22:39:55] <newpy> ok I get the math now, not sure why we can just place x in there (b/c x=1 doesn't change it or?)
[22:41:15] <cherim> It doesn't change much (and isn't needed) when you sum  binom(n, k) p^k (1-p)^k

[23:53:04] <buster> oh, I misread qergle's "it's a function of a function of x and t", sorry
[23:53:06] <buster> it is :)
