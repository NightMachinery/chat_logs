[09:13:16] <bookworm> Max-P: the issue that bugs me the most with debhelper is that it's effing magic. "It will figure out most build systems". Yeah, no. Just let me tell you what you should be doing and in which order. The documentation for that is almost non existent and split over I don't know how many manpages. Also as soon as dh updates its magic I guarantee that
[09:13:16] <bookworm> shit will break because we don't adhere to the npm packaging guidelines of debian
[09:14:15] <Max-P> Oh don't even get me started on that
[09:14:27] <bookworm> heck, the people in debian are still fighting git rather than use it and keep shoving patches in with quilt
[09:14:41] <Max-P> It makes SO MANY ASSUMPTIONS based on the realities of the 90s where everything you'd want to package was a Makefile for C and it just worked
[09:15:34] <bookworm> yeah...
[09:16:01] <bookworm> and we're definitely not extracting every single dep into its own package, just no
[09:16:13] <Max-P> I'm actually building something that's versionned on git, nope, can't even do that. It must be a tarball and it must be named exactly the debian way, forcing you to basically clone the repo, tar it up, then untar it back up to build your package which will... tar it back up yet again
[09:16:42] <Max-P> they just slapped a tool to make the first tarball for you automatically instead lmao
[09:17:23] <bookworm> nah, that does work, git-buildpackage . but then you have awfully strange branching patterns, still have to mess with a changelog and other shenanigans and some shitty tool called pristine-tarball
[09:17:33] <Max-P> Basically everytime I try debhelper again I'm like "well, the custom shell script ain't so bad after all eh"
[09:17:52] <bookworm> yeah... I'm at the same frustration level
[09:18:10] <bookworm> how they handle sources is beyond me
[09:18:29] <Max-P> everyone still releases software as tarballs on FTP servers right
[09:18:46] <bookworm> they default assume that they won't use the proper source anyhow and essentially hard fork every single package upstream
[09:19:12] <Max-P> Meanwhile, on Arch: aur build and bam it's in my custom repo for all my boxes
[09:19:23] <bookworm> tarballs are absolutely useless, we have git for gods sake
[09:20:52] <bookworm> just let me add a submodule / subtree of you are that dead set on vendoring the source code rather than a sane caching proxy within the distro, but keep the effing control files outside of the source tree so that it's easy to keep upstream untainted
[09:21:16] <bookworm> but no, too easy
[09:22:02] <bookworm> but going forward, I think it we will need to essentially unmagic debhelper, it's gonna be fun

[14:21:12] <bookworm> majavah: it is, thanks
[14:25:12] <bookworm> majavah: with what do you build?
[14:25:53] <bookworm> also would you be interested in helping to fix our package upstream? As you might be able to tell neither max nor me really know what we are doing
[14:28:37] <bookworm> also, how do you handle the C dep of sqlite? ignore it and say do a from source build? We'd probably want people to just install a deb, which is why there's the post install hackery. Better would be a cross compilation step I think
[14:28:55] <bookworm> but alas I'm not at the point where I understand debian packaging
[14:32:55] <majavah> bookworm: pdebuild, with "-- --use-network yes" to download npm packages during the build process
[14:33:28] <bookworm> that does not build in a clean chroot does it? or is that the one that does?
[14:33:37] <majavah> I think it does
[14:33:42] <majavah> (not 100% sure)
[14:35:03] <majavah> I don't do anything special with sqlite, yarn buils it during the installation process (I think), debhelper makes sure the libraries it links to will be added as dependencies, and the .debs will be amd64 specific
[14:35:37] <majavah> i can help whatever I can, but I'm by no means an expert
[14:35:40] <bookworm> it doesn't, it fetches a binary blob on most architectures
[14:35:52] <bookworm> you'd need to force a from source build
[14:36:15] <bookworm> but even that uses the bundled copy unless you override it to use the system dep...
[14:36:48] <bookworm> it's all bundled, debhelper should not do anything
[14:37:21] <bookworm> (re linked libraries)
[14:41:35] <bookworm> in fact, you definitely have the binary blob if you build in a clean chroot and it works, you're missing python as well as a C compile in the deps
[14:41:44] <bookworm> or is C assumed?
[14:41:56] <bookworm> compiler*
[14:42:07] <bookworm> (and node-gyp uses python)
[14:45:38] <majavah> you can assume the build-essential package is installed, which includes at least c and c++ compilers

[23:11:01] <Megaf> Hi everyone
[23:11:15] <Megaf> I'm setting up the lounge here on debian, from the deb package
[23:11:28] <Megaf> I'd like to use apache as a reverse proxy to it
[23:16:09] <xnaas> https://thelounge.chat/docs/guides/reverse-proxies#apache
[23:16:50] <c014> I didn't realise it was a question
[23:21:29] <Megaf> It wasn't a question yet, I started doing and would ask questions if I had :P
[23:21:45] <Megaf> But that link is very helpful indeed, thanks @xnaas

[23:26:50] <bookworm> then from that same shell run yarn install
[23:28:01] <toro> will cloudflare pass ip‚Äôs to thelounge ?
[23:28:36] <toro> reading that doc ^
[23:28:40] <bookworm> if you tell it to do that, yes
[23:28:43] <toro> cool
[23:28:45] <xnaas> Do you want cloudflare's IPs or do you want the IPs of the actually connecting users? :P
[23:28:51] <toro> connecting users
[23:28:54] <toro> ofc
[23:29:13] <xnaas> I don't know about Apache, since I don't use it, but in nginx you have to add some shit to get real IPs instead of Cloudflare's.
[23:29:18] <xnaas> I would assume Apache is similar.
[23:29:33] <toro> which we have working on kiwi , but haven‚Äôt pulled the trigger to go thelounge on production yet. I‚Äôm waiting for 4,3 since that‚Äôs about to come out
[23:29:53] <xnaas> "about to" is some very optimistic wording. ;P
[23:29:59] <toro> :-)
[23:30:50] <toro> it was very pessimistic wording, for the product I used to support ‚Äî you may as well announce there‚Äôs a tsunami coming and we have 8 minutes to live but that‚Äôs off topic.
[23:33:33] <Megaf> a2enmod headers needs to be added to that tutorial
[23:34:15] <Megaf> also Apache doesnt like anything after the number in proxytimeout
[23:37:16] <bookworm> Megaf: feel free to send a patch that improves it
[23:37:45] <bookworm> I can't say much about apache, I try not to use it if I can avoid it
[23:37:50] <xnaas> ^ heh
[23:37:58] <Megaf> I might, at the moment I'm just trying to get the thing running
