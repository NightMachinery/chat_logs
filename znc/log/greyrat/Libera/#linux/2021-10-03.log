[01:10:42] <talismanick> keir: I'm not saying they do. I am saying "if you have nothing nice to say, don't say anything" is something most known, and a violation thereof usually carries an implication.
[01:10:49] <phogg> talismanick: try asking a Windows channel how to make Windows things happen. Once you have your image feel free to come back for getting it running.

[02:04:26] <rustytaco> I was really hopeful about covid when they said it might kill up to 20% of earths population...but here we are -- fully disappointed.

[08:11:09] <Minus_One> gruntovocan, there is something to be said for the clean delineation that separating /home to its own partition creates. Especially if you want multiple linux distros installed. But your files will be there, in one partition or another, even if something breaks your system bad enough that you can't boot. If you want protection from files getting deleted, you need backups.

[09:28:59] <tsapien> the way I've always understood is is that /proc was initially meant to display process information, but slowly had more and more things added into it. So someone had the bright idea to create /sys for non-PID info...which is why /sys is much better organized. However because so much was already in /proc it had to be kept for backwards compatability

[10:12:58] <Sauvin> golden_ticket, what's wrong with the kernel you already have?
[10:13:07] <n4dir> usually you install a different kernel, run upgrade-grub (which often if not always happens always when installing a new kernel), and if you want to set the new kernel to be default in /etc/default/grub
[10:13:23] <golden_ticket> Sauvin: this kernel i'm trying to download allows me to manage a single system image.

[11:21:29] <pluri> p` isn't that the point of adding a user to the sudo group?
[11:21:29] <hexnewbie> pluri: A group name 'sudo' is just a group named sudo. You need some configuration in sudoers to give that group meaning
[11:21:46] <sheep> no, that would allow a user to use sudo
[11:22:18] <pluri> yeah the instructions in the tut i'm following say it's supposed to give it sudo powers
[11:22:19] <p`> you still need to use sudo, being in the group just allows you to do so (assuming that's how your sudoers is setup)
[11:22:37] <hexnewbie> pluri: E.g. you can create sudoers which allows everyone in the group sudo to switch to root (still asking for passwords), denying everyone else.
[11:22:53] <p`> or are you saying sudo still isn't working for you?  in which case, nod, seeing how sudoers is setup would be next
[11:23:06] <pluri> so it's possible to have a user where prefixing a command with `sudo` isn't permitted altogether, regardless if you have the password?

[11:23:52] <TJ-> Anyone know of a cgroups-aware atop/htop/top type tool
[11:23:52] <pluri> so only root is allowed to run all commands under sudo by default without prefixing?
[11:23:56] <hexnewbie> pluri: 'sudo' asks for the password of *your* user, not the target user, so yeah, that's not only possible, it's both the default and pretty sane (since every user knows their own password)
[11:23:57] <p`> well, disallow the privilege escalation of it anyway
[11:24:18] <p`> root wouldn't need sudo cause it's already root
[11:24:19] <sheep> pluri: root doesn't run things under sudo; sudo elevates privileges to root
[11:24:24] <Sauvin> OH, there's something about NOPASSWD in the sudoers file.
[11:24:52] <pluri> ok this is starting to make sense
[11:24:53] <pluri> Sauvin where is that?
[11:24:57] <ThinkT510> if you don't belong to the sudo group (or wheel group) then you are not allowed to use sudo. being in the group doesn't mean it enables use, you need to enable that separately. also, adding a user to a group means you'll need to logout and back in again to take effect
[11:25:09] <p`> sudo can be setup to allow anyone in group "sudo" to run sudo with or without a password, yes
[11:25:10] <n4dir> isn't sudo rather to run a specific, root rights needing, command, not to become root? Usually
[11:25:34] <n4dir> then you got ALL, so you can run all commands, but still the main point is not to become root, but to run a command (to run commands)
[11:25:35] <pluri> p` and in that case prefixing with sudo would still be required, it just wouldn't ask for the pw anymore?

[11:25:58] <hexnewbie> The password does not add as much security as it seems (malware can snoop your TTY or replace your sudo to discover the password), but one may still consider keeping the password for more security.

[11:29:15] <Sauvin> n4dir, on a system where only one person really ever uses the computer, it doesn't matter. On a server with craploads of users, a well-planned sudoers file can allow for considerable privilege separation granularity.
[11:29:42] * Sauvin kicks TJ- for being a smartass
[11:30:20] <n4dir> Sauvin: i just thought about my reasons and the possible reason for sudo. I doubt i will ever run in your described situation ( and then you sure hear often enough of sudo to quickly get your head in it. But, as said, it won't happen. Basement and all)
[11:30:20] <p`> pluri: if you want your user to be able to escalate themselves to root, to where they can run commands without it being through sudo, you can do the group add you already did, make sure sudoers allows any command if you're in that group, and then you can run "sudo su -".  that works the same way as logging in as root, and you can exit that shell to return to your normal user
[11:30:27] <TJ-> requiring the user's password to elevate privileges is also protection against malicious tools that would otherwise be allowed to execute a provileged command

[20:31:02] <puff> Good afternoon.  I am trying to figure out how to use the thunderbird email client (though I'm open to using a shell script or other imap client) to download 1000+ emails with attached zip files from gmail.  TL;DR, I exported my content from a website and they've sent me all these emails and now my gmail account is full.
[20:31:11] <Psi-Jack> So, wow.. I'm now only using 1~3% CPU of 40 CPUs, and 20% RAM of 92GB RAM in my newly upgraded PVE cluster, without Ceph.
[20:31:36] <xiaomiao> Psi-Jack: now you need to find ways to keep it busy? ;)
[20:31:54] <Psi-Jack> xiaomiao: Ayup! I can finally do new projects and learn new things again.
[20:32:03] <xiaomiao> puff: check the gmail doc for imap (need a custom auth token etc.)
[20:32:16] <xiaomiao> puff: from the TB side it's a 'normal' IMAP account
[20:32:32] <Psi-Jack> And STILL I have upgradability to bring up RAM to 64GB per server from 32GB, and add in not just 1, but 2 NVMe SSDs in each. 😀
[20:33:04] <xiaomiao> in theory you might be able to add more, there's pcie to m.2 adapters
[20:33:11] <ramblebamble> Psi-Jack what do you intend to do with so much power at your fingertips?
[20:33:14] <ramblebamble> you scare me
[20:33:15] <xiaomiao> there are some restrictions with those ...

[20:33:48] <NoRouteToAPI> xiaomiao what about the 2 xeon m2 pcie in each server? i can't imagine a scenario in which i'd want 2 xeon m2s
[20:33:52] <puff> xiaomiao: I have thunderbird all set up and it's (just now) finished synchronizing or whatever.  My next steps are 1) figuring out how to actually download all my gmail emails as a backup (assuming I have enough disk free, so I guess that's step 1a) and 2) figuring out how to extract/download all 1000+ attached zip files without having to do a few thousand mouse clicks.
[20:33:53] <xiaomiao> ramblebamble: my desktop has a Ryzen 9, and currently ...  load average: 123.78, 81.41, 50.21
[20:34:05] <NoRouteToAPI> i mean with the cim (cim4) or wim (wim4) adapters
[20:34:17] <NoRouteToAPI> ok
[20:34:24] <puff> xiaomiao: I'm assuming that thunderbird defaults to leaving all the emails on gmail, since that's what imap was designed to do.
[20:34:24] <xiaomiao> puff: for automation maybe fetchmail is worth a look
[20:34:35] <xiaomiao> yes, everything should still exist on server
[20:34:39] <NoRouteToAPI> it was never designed to keep email at gmail?

[20:35:22] <NoRouteToAPI> the autojoin is the following :
[20:35:27] <puff> NoRouteToAPI: imap was designed as an alternative for pop3, because pop3 was never intended to support having the emails live on the server long-term.
[20:35:36] <xiaomiao> ramblebamble: there's 4x m.2 on single pcie board, they require mainboard support afaict (pcie bifurcation)

[20:36:16] <ak77> hello. I have a test program that measures time to get http response (flow is as follows test-REQ->nodered-REQ->networkdevice-RESP->node-red-RESP->test), what I observe is that if I do test requests without sleep between them (as fast as possible), whole chain happens in ~4ms, but if I add 1 second between test requests, this goes to around 14ms on average (check graphs at https://imgur.com/a/pBd0Rj3). Any ideas how to keep performance in case of 1s
[20:36:16] <ak77>  sleep? (can be achieved as seen around 1400th sample on second graph)
[20:36:16] <ramblebamble> even with a card in the native PCIE slot?
[20:36:29] <xiaomiao> ceph has some convenient features, but it is kinda needlessly complex
[20:36:50] <puff> NoRouteToAPI: I'm not sure what you mean.  At the moment, though, what I'm concerned iwth is primarily a) extracting all these zip files and then deleting the emails so my gmail won't be full anymore, b) then after that, making sure I have a backup copy of my mail (which is something I've been meaning to do for awhile, anyway).
[20:36:50] <Psi-Jack> ramblebamble: I know both. And Ceph right now, is what I just got away from after having major issues with it. I never lost a single byte with it in the ~15 years I ran it, but it's memory consumption rate is massively getting huge, and doesn't mix well when you run virtual machines together with the ceph cluster.
[20:37:02] <NoRouteToAPI> ...
[20:37:30] <ramblebamble> ok then I will stick to GlusterFS for now :) thanks for the input, because I was thinking over migrating over to Ceph, but reading this I stick to Gluster

[21:12:37] <ramblebamble> wombawom1a, here is the tar-pipe-approach was talking about, I cannot think of anything else  without heavy customization/writing own code, [[R]] demo time:  tar cf - file.tar|tar x -O
[21:12:48] <NoRouteToAPI> We were talking about using Linux or other OS as a base system to run an application.

[21:13:07] <Sauvin> node1, its "limit of computation", if I understand you properly, may be a bit hard to define or even describe, but you could in theory work with integers with roughly half as many digits as you have memory locations.

[21:14:21] <NoRouteToAPI> There is an integer limit though, that is

[21:14:46] <Sauvin> node1, no, not 6 or 7. You're right, the actual limits of floating point numbers is limited, but those limits are large enough you don't need to worry about them, and the abolute error is in the parts per... what? Septillions?
