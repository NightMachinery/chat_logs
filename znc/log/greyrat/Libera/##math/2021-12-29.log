[00:00:05] <Inline> eh ?
[00:00:41] <mycroftiv> maybe that is too simple minded a view, i honestly find simple 1-categories hard enough to understand, n-categorical arrows of arrows isnt mentally tractable for me yet

[00:01:20] <Gurkenglas> mycroftiv, the definition I gave isn't much of a heightening, just a generalization - adjoint functors are just adjunctions in the 2-category of categories, functors and natural transformations
[00:01:22] <mycroftiv> inline: yes because shoes are identifiable as left-right and socks are symmetrical
[00:02:56] <Inline> with shoes, the two members of the pair are different, so we can easily define a function that distinguishes between them.

[00:03:06] <Inline> ooh so he views socks as symmetrical ok
[00:03:16] <Inline> now i get it
[00:03:30] <Inline> that's not my view with socks, but anyway now it makes sense
[00:03:32] <Inline> lol
[00:03:56] <mycroftiv> gurkenglas: well you said things 'bristle with meaning' - are these meaning-bristles analogous to the meaning of good old fashioned adjoint functors at the 1-level? if so, it seems we dont need a new conceptual understanding for 2+ ? or does something weird/magical happen?
[00:04:28] <Gurkenglas> mycroftiv, i'm saying adjoint functors are already at the 2-level, because their definition talks about natural transformations
[00:04:55] <Gurkenglas> so when you have something else that can be composed horizontally/vertically like natural transformations, you have a corresponding meaning of adjunction
[00:05:50] <Gurkenglas> Inline, you can turn a left sock inside out to make it a right sock :3
[00:06:11] <Inline> hmmm, you sure Gurkenglas ?
[00:06:23] <Gurkenglas> yeah wanna bet
[00:06:33] <Inline> why bet ?
[00:06:47] <Inline> how do you suppose that's gonna happen ?
[00:06:54] <Inline> that you make a right out of a left ?
[00:07:04] <Gurkenglas> because asking oneself whether one is willing to bet is a useful trick to notice one's doubts
[00:07:27] <Inline> because all i will get is a inverted left sock
[00:07:34] <mycroftiv> gurkenglas: it sounds like you already understand the concepts pretty well, so good luck finding the deeper motivation you are asking about. btw, do you understand grothendieck topologies?
[00:08:03] <Gurkenglas> Inline, http://sketchtoy.com/70348780

[00:42:56] <Gurkenglas> mycroftiv, by https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Grothendieck+topology it's a set of coverings which contains every isomorphism, is closed under a manner of composition, and is closed under some manner of operation involving a pullback. so to understand this i'd start by writing it in terms of natural transformations. A covering is a natural transformation from I->C to some constant functor I->*->C, where I is discrete.
[00:42:56] <Gurkenglas> The composition means, if we have J->I and J->C => J->I->C and I->C => I->*->C then our topology must also contain the composite of these natural transformations J->C => J->*->C. The pullback thingy is... if we have I->C => I->*->C <= I->*->C, then we can complete that diamond and the => parallel to the one we have is also ours.

[01:08:42] <mycroftiv> good point indeed
[01:09:31] <mycroftiv> interesting to point out how different the 'function input notation' is from the 'categorical arrow notation' even in contexts when you could be describing the same things
[01:11:04] <Gurkenglas> the arrow formulas are an efficient language where meaningful things tend to have short descriptions and short sentences tend to mean something and so playing lego instead of play-doh and striving to minimize epicycles tends to get you far

[10:06:32] <tusko> but you need to account for sensistivity and specificity in practice
[10:07:06] <tusko> That is, what proportion of the time does it say you're positive when you are actually positive and what proportion of the time does it tell you you're negative when you are, in fact, negative.
[10:09:32] <tusko> P{positive | test positive} = P{test positive | positive}/[P{test positive | positive} + P{test positive | negative}]
[10:11:18] <tusko> someone else may want to correct this, but I believe its a decent first approximation

[10:15:01] <tusko> Now, since you did say two tests, I think we'd probably want to make use of the complement (1 - P{positive | test positive})^2
[10:16:07] <tusko> and that should give you teh odds that two positive test results were actually wrong, and the truth is that the patient is negative

[10:16:45] <Descartes> It's an antigen test and the patient is asymptomatic
[10:17:16] <Descartes> He is getting the test because the day before, he was symptomatic
[10:17:41] <Descartes> Actually, he already got a PCR test, but won't get any results for 5 to 7 days
[10:17:41] <tusko> Honestly that shouldn't matter. The sensitivity and specificity should be given values based on large samples of patients.
[10:18:17] <Descartes> but I want this to be a mathematics problem and not a bioinformatics problem, so keeping it more simple
[10:18:33] <tusko> PCR is a better test. But 2 positive results on antigen should be sufficient to consider quarantining, but that goes a bit beyond math.
[10:18:41] <Descartes> so assume that the test is always 41% accurate regardless of the conditions

[10:20:21] <Descartes> Acctually, according to the CDC, the rapid antigen test is 41% accurate for positive results (sensitivity), and 98.4% accurate for negative results (specificity)
[10:21:56] <Descartes> So let's say the patient is now asymptomatic and you are administering the test with the expectation that it will always be 41% acccurate regardless of the other conditions or factors
[10:21:59] <tusko> ok, so P{positive | test positive} = P{test positive | positive}[P{test positive | positive} + P{test positive | negative}] = 0.41/0.41 + 0.16 ~= 0.73

[10:23:03] <tusko> So I'd say there's ~7% chance they are negative based on those tests
[10:23:26] <tusko> nope I messed that up

[10:25:05] <Descartes> I figure you just need to add up the results and divide by the sum of all the possible outcomes, and that should give you the probability of getting an accurate positive result
[10:25:26] <tusko> 0.41/(0.41 + 0.016) = 0.962; (1-0.962) = 0.038; 0.038^2 = 0.0014 = 0.14% chance they are negative

[15:35:23] <zacts> how does it compare with haskell or coq?
[15:35:53] <mycroftiv> zacts: its like a more haskell-like approach to the same things coq does
[15:36:07] <mycroftiv> coq and agda are both dependently typed proof languages

[15:39:14] <mycroftiv> you can figure out a type signature that is like an encoding of a logical formula that is the theorem you want to prove, then write a series of lemmas with holes and have agda help solve them. in that final file there are many unfilled holes still because i deliberately wrote a very generalized interface
[15:40:06] <mycroftiv> some will be filled eventually, some may be removed in a more refined version, but i can ask agda to tell me what the type is for any of those green ?? holes and analyze what types i try to put in to fill them
[15:40:47] <zacts> neat
[15:41:06] <mycroftiv> i had before i started work a large amount of code already by Erik Palmgren for set/type translation, and a large category theory library by Carette
[15:41:27] <mycroftiv> so because i had those already existing 'reliable' types, i could make my new types connect properly to them ,and have agda tell me what made sense
[15:42:13] <mycroftiv> and gradually work with the definitions in those 4 papers that define this sheaf topos and eventually reach the final output type of the sheaf of nonstandard natural numbers object
[15:42:32] <zacts> the code that you linked the other day kind of reminds me of literate programming

[20:32:51] <Z-module> cadmio: as we said up there, G being solvable and nontrivial means it has proper subgroup N with G/N abelian. But G simple means N = {e}. So G itself is abelian (thus all of its subgroups are normal), and simple. So that means the *only* subgroups of G at all are G and {e}.	So.... you should probably prove that G has to be finite, first, though I bet they want you to just assume that.

[20:39:41] <Z-module> isekaijin: the subnormal thing you said only applies in the case of finite G, but that's typically what we're talking about for solvability anyway.   For example, Q being abelian is certainly solvable, but it has no subgroups of prime index (or any finite index > 1).
[20:40:21] *** Joins: the_lanetly_052 (~the_lanet@185.30.91.255)
[20:43:28] <cadmio> ah because G/{e} is abelian by def of solvability but it coincides with G itself
[20:44:50] <Z-module> well, it's =~ G, but not technically the same actual set
[20:46:10] <Z-module> G solvable means there are subgroups G = N_0 > N_1 > ... > N_k = {e}  where each N_j  (j > 0) is normal in the previous and each quotient is abelian.  But for this exercise you only need the first N_1 there.
[20:46:42] <Z-module> oh, with every '>' in there meaning proper containment
[20:47:06] <cadmio> since G/{e} = {x{e} | x in G}
[20:47:18] <Z-module>  and ignore the case of G = {e}, which is solvable too, but for most people does not qualify as simp;le
[20:47:22] <cadmio> I assumed G/{e} and G are the same
[20:47:43] <Z-module> The elements of G/{e} are all the singleton sets {g}   (g ranging over G)
[20:47:48] <Z-module> this is not the same as {all g in G}
[20:48:13] <Z-module> but it's clearly an isomorphic group
[20:50:12] <Z-module> so anyway, you have G abelian now, if G is solvable and simple. Are you supposed to assume G finite? If not, you can prove it fairly easily.

[20:51:25] <cadmio> my text gives me this definition of quotient group https://imgur.com/Xa76wNK.png
[20:52:52] <Z-module> it's strange notation: they don't mean you take only the xN such that xN = Nx -- because N normal means *all* xN = Nx.  The elements of G/N are just all the distinct cosets xN  (x in G).  Or if you prefer you can say all the cosets Nx  -- same thing.

[20:52:55] <cadmio> with that def G and G/{e} are to be considered the same, isn't it?
[20:53:09] <Z-module> When N is {e}, each  xN  is the set  {x}
[20:53:17] <Z-module> {x} is not the same set as x, ever
[20:53:27] <Z-module> (in ordinary set theory)
[20:53:55] <Z-module> So if G = {e,a,a^2} = C_3, then  G/{e} = { {e}, {a}, {a^2} }
[20:54:18] <Z-module> it's essentially the same set of things, but now each item is a one-element set
[20:54:52] <cadmio> ah ok I'd consider the elements of G/N as sets not elements
[20:55:11] <Z-module> and you still calculate in this group the same as in the old, in the sense that  xN yN  in the quotient is just  (xy)N,  so if N is {e}, we're using  {x}{y} = {xy}   in the quotient.
[20:55:35] <Z-module> elements of ANY quotient group are cosets, which are certain sets
[20:55:50] <Z-module> the set  xN   is just the set  {xn : n in N}

[20:58:05] <Z-module> so in your problem, G/{e} abelian means  {x}{y} = {y}{x}  for all {x}, {y} in G/{e}, which just means  xy = yx  for all x, y in G:  so G is also abelian.
[20:58:55] <Z-module> because in G/{e},  {x}{y} = {xy},   {y}{x} = {yx},  and two one-element sets are the same set iff they contain the same single element.
[21:00:20] <Z-module> if N is normal in G but *bigger* than {e}, then G/N abelian does not in general imply G is.
[21:00:39] <Z-module> but it does easily, as above, if N = {e}

[21:03:16] <Z-module> or you can ignore the "inside each set" details, and instead use the First Isomorphism Theorem. The identity map  i: G -> G  is surjective with kernel {e}, thus  i(G) = G =~ G/{e}
[21:03:17] <cadmio> or better {e}x * {e}y = xy
[21:04:06] <cadmio> which is equal since the quotient is abelian to Ny * Nx = yx

[21:11:47] <Z-module> To be _quite_ precise about all this, we really should use two different operation symbols for the mult. in the group G vs. the mult. in the group G/N.  Say '*' and '#' , respectively.  The product  Nx # Ny  in G/N is, by definition, the single coset  N(x*y).  So  Nx # Ny = Ny # Nx  means  N(x*y) = N(y*x).  If N is {e}, this gives  {e*(x*y)} = {e*(y*x)}.  Group axioms then give  {x*y} = {y*x}.  Those sets being equal means that x*y =

[22:16:10] <klf> Here 3Blue1Brown and Steven Strogatz describes the famous brachistochrone problem: https://youtu.be/Cld0p3a43fU?t=572

[22:17:33] <klf> The illustration shows that the wheel spins counter-closeise.  Shouldn't the wheel be moving in the opposite direction (that is, from right to left)?
[22:18:11] <klf> counter-clockwise*

[22:26:43] <Z-module> I would say they imagine this wheel rolling toward the right along the top horizontal line, starting at that left point where the cycloid and the line meet. If so, then the wheel is turning counterclockwise.
[22:27:04] <Z-module> it looks odd because the wheel seems to be defying gravity.
[22:28:06] <Z-module> Just imagine that is the wheel of a car, the long horizontal line is the road, and this picture is upside-down.

[22:28:47] <sonny> I am looking at a recurrence that has a sum in it. The solution to this recurrence was also a sum, except I notice the solution has an additional term that I cannot figure out where it came from. Do you think this term comes from the sum itself? For reference pg [15-]20 of <https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~cse547/newLec6.pdf>. The additional term is
[22:28:48] <sonny> -(2/3)(n+1).
