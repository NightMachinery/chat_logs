[00:46:42] <anon16_> oldlaptop: most web severs gzip the output, so this isn't the reason

[00:46:54] <oldlaptop> anon16_: Yes it is.
[00:46:57] <Quietwalker> anon16: Sure.  You only have to share the code if you as the site owner, have modified it.  So you have someone else modify the code, provide the source code to you, and you run it without having to offer source.
[00:47:02] <oldlaptop> Not *the* reason, but an important reason.
[00:47:09] <jeaye> Izem: most JS is gzipped over the wire.

[00:47:57] <oldlaptop> transparent gzip compression is not actually as common as it should be, because of an overreaction of sorts: gzipping dynamically-generated content is dangerous because it can be used to attack TLS encryption.

After that, just don't use any frameworks & libraries, the browser APIs are good enough for almost everything.
[01:01:03] <DPA> Also, make sure to learn to decouple components using custom events. With all that, you'll never need to change your app again, nor need (and shouldn't) ever use any libraries.

[01:29:00] <d3x0r> webnet4 I compiled the C version of the JSOX parser into WASM, then got a object with .stringify(), .parse() on it.... you do need a interface on the JS side, and you ened a interface on the C side with EM_ASM( "//JS code" ) to communicate with the JS side
[01:29:25] <d3x0r> JSOX .parse() has to create a bunch of JS objects, includign like Date and Bignum
[01:29:28] <Quietwalker> Hmm.  There was a thought that as some point in time, some basic concept of programming would be nearly required for folks to get by.  Like, things will be customizable enough that if you don't understand the concept of an expression evaluation for flow control (if, while, etc) that you wouldn't be able to use certain basic products, but ...

[03:10:38] <Quietwalker> alright. Change in topic.  Got a SQL sproc that takes a user defined table type as an argument. This type is used in a few places.

I mean, we could duplicate the type with a new name, copy the sprocs, update them to use the new code, and have the new library be the only user of the new type, then once everything's been merged up, rename back and clean up in a separate work effort.

[03:33:29] <oldlaptop> it's not a question of different units; the Kelvin scale uses the same unit as the Celsius scale, in the sense that a temperature difference of one degree Celsius is the same as a temperature difference of one Kelvin

[03:35:19] <LjL> 40C isn't "twice" 20C except numerically which doesn't relate to the actual temperature at all
[03:35:26] <oldlaptop> "twice as far from the temperature at which my favorite solvent freezes" would be a bit wacky, but much more sensical
[03:35:42] <LjL> it's like assigning a special meaning to a palindrome date. it's kinda fun, but it doesn't make that day *actually* special
[03:35:48] <vdamewood> s/solvent/compound/
[03:36:01] <LjL> s/isn't/is/
[03:36:02] <Quietwalker> Language is contexual, you'd want to assume it was relative to the system of discussion, but even if it wasn't it'd be odd to assume that the norm for any given system is necessarily 0.
[03:36:04] <oldlaptop> well, solvents are compounds
[03:36:11] <dre> reminds me of this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C91gKuxutTU
[03:36:27] <oldlaptop> Quietwalker: Which is why using a temperature scale at which numeric 0 is not zero is so insidious
[03:36:47] <oldlaptop> the assumption that leads people to use is completely wrong
[03:36:47] <Quietwalker> and since the discuss was in Celsius, and he had just provided a numeric value of ... 36-37, someone saying that's  double an acceptable value, 
[03:36:50] <vdamewood> oldlaptop: Yeah, oops. For a second, I thought water wasn't a solvent... but now I think it is.
[03:36:56] <Quietwalker> it's just ... easy to read and obvious.
[03:37:15] <dre> I think "twice as cold" should be 0.5*T (in kelvin)
[03:37:22] <Quietwalker> Language is an exceptionally imprecise construct, after all.
[03:37:28] *** Joins: gitgood (~gitgood@80-44-15-108.dynamic.dsl.as9105.com)
[03:37:30] <oldlaptop> Quietwalker: and completely, utterly wrong
[03:37:32] <Quietwalker> it'd take too long to be accurate.
[03:37:36] <oldlaptop> dre: precisely
[03:37:50] <dre> then twice as hot would be 2*T 
[03:38:08] <Quietwalker> I mean, you'd spent all day talking and you still would be unable to describe your personal explicit ontological status as regards a single concept.
[03:38:27] <LjL> if you walk 10km every day and one day you have to walk 20km, you might go "wow, that's twice as long as i usually do" and that would be *physically true*. with temperature, it stops being true if you do as little as change to fahrenheit, so what meaning does it have? "oh, it's higher", that's about it
[03:38:28] <Quietwalker> but you'd probably be able to get 99.99% of it thanks to shared cultural or linguistic overlap
[03:39:25] <Quietwalker> so we very much accept impreciseness, even as it leads to occasional misunderstandings, because there's no brain-to-brain transfer without error and there's no obvious other way to communicate concepts as a pure rather than practical device.
[03:39:39] <Quietwalker> So it's all good.  You can use context from previous statements

[03:40:10] <oldlaptop> this is a difference in kind from the usual "but language is imprecise" dodge, as anyone who's attempted to apply the ideal gas law has found out, possibly the hard way
[03:40:13] <Quietwalker> and derive information in the combination of messages rather than each message having to exist as an objective solo.
[03:40:28] <vdamewood> "Hot" is an indication of heat energy in a medium. Going from 20C to 40C isn't double the amount of heat energy. It's an increase of about 6% of the heat energy.
[03:40:54] <Quietwalker> Yep, but hot IS a relative term because it requires a context.
[03:41:00] <vdamewood> Which means the molicuels in the medium are bouncing around at 106% the speed.
[03:41:55] <Quietwalker> it's hot out : "The temp is higher than it normally is" or "This is a temp that is uncomfortable to me" or "this is a temp that is uncomfortable to what I consider the average person" - all valid definitions
[03:42:19] <Quietwalker> and you can't be more precise until you get additional information, like knowing the person really well.
[03:42:37] <Quietwalker> but unless it matters, it doesn't ... well ... matter enough to spend effort on.
[03:43:03] <Quietwalker> though I do enjoy discussing philosophical semantics :)
[03:43:45] <oldlaptop> I guess the laws of physics are a philosophical construct.

[04:53:49] <JackFin> e is just infiite sum 1/n! 
[04:54:03] <mawk> or lim (1+1/n)^n
[04:54:07] <mawk> or a thousand other things
[04:54:12] <mawk> pikapika: φ, the golden ratio
[04:54:15] <mawk> is the hardest to approximate
[04:54:19] <JackFin> and probably why factorial has 2 weird fixed points at 0, 1 (otherwise e woulnt start with a 2)
[04:54:27] <pikapika> mawk, phi is very easy
[04:54:29] <oldlaptop> lim($version_number_of_metafont)
[04:54:32] <pikapika> Ist the square root of an integer
[04:54:38] <mawk> so what pikapika 
[04:54:40] <pikapika> SQuare roots of small integers is also easy to calculate
[04:54:48] <mawk> it's "easy" in the procedure
[04:54:50] <pikapika> I'd say among the well known constants pi is hardest
[04:54:54] <pikapika> mawk, the code is easy too
[04:55:00] <mawk> it doesn't matter if the code looks easy
[04:55:06] <pikapika> Even a newton rapshon inverse square root is easy
[04:55:07] <JackFin> you can easily approximate pi via random markov experiment
[04:55:12] <pikapika> and thats not the simplest method applicable
[04:55:17] <mawk> I'm not talking about the complexity of the code or the method pikapika 
[04:55:19] <JackFin> maybe exact is more complex
[04:55:23] <pikapika> mawk, then what
[04:55:44] <mawk> I'm saying it's the constant that is the hardest to approximate using rationals whose denominator is a given size
[04:55:58] <JackFin> (goes for any constant derived geometrically) 
[04:56:20] <pikapika> What does size mean i nthis context?
[04:56:21] <mawk> like you know π has nice approximations like 22/7 and others
[04:56:26] <pikapika> There is a simple continued fraction for phi
[04:56:34] <mawk> yes, and look at it
[04:56:40] <mawk> the continued fractions is just ones, all the way down
[04:56:48] <JackFin> oldlaptop yea good point 
[04:56:50] <pikapika> So?
[04:56:53] <mawk> that means wherever you cut the continued fraction, you get a bad approximation
[04:56:58] <pikapika> I see
[04:57:00] <mawk> because 1 is the smallest integer you can have
[04:57:08] <pikapika> I dont remember how but I had a method to accelerate the convergence of the fraction
[04:57:14] <mawk> if you have a very big integer in the continued fraction and you cut at that spot, then you get an excellent approximation
[04:57:23] <mawk> and φ has only 1, so you can only have bad approximations
[04:57:24] <oldlaptop> mawk: but isn't zero smaller?
[04:57:26] * oldlaptop runs away
[04:57:29] <mawk> :(
[04:57:34] <pikapika> I'll let you know if I remember that method maw
[04:57:36] <pikapika> mawk
[04:57:49] <pikapika> I had a way to accelerate these continued fractions quite fast
[04:58:27] <mawk> yes you can have a lot of methods to go faster, but still for a fraction p/q and a higher bound for q, the approximation of φ will be pretty bad when compared to trying to approximate π for instance
[04:58:50] <mawk> like if you want the denominator to be less than 100, you can find a good fraction for π, but only bad ones for φ
[04:59:35] <pikapika> mawk, I meant an acceleration that precisely operates on the well known continued fraction
[04:59:45] <pikapika> mawk, but there is another thing anyways
[04:59:47] <mawk> yes
[04:59:53] <pikapika> sqrt(5) has a faster continued fraction
[05:00:03] <pikapika> We can obtain a good rational for phi much better with sqrt(5)
[05:00:33] <mawk> well no it cannot be "much better"
[05:00:43] <mawk> once you prove that φ is always bad, then it's the same for whatever you can do with φ
[05:01:24] <pikapika> hmm
[05:01:43] <mawk> but yes it approximates slightly better
[05:01:45] <pikapika> sqrt(5) is not nice either...but as I said, I distinctly remember I had a series acceleration technique for continued fractions of this nature
[05:02:05] <mawk> algebraic numbers will always have a lousy approximation anyway
[05:02:28] <mawk> transcendental numbers can have very big numbers in the continued fraction and thus have good approxmations
[05:02:47] <pikapika> I think it involved using the ratios of larger fibonacci numbers in some indirect manner
[05:02:56] <pikapika> and it was quite fast

[05:03:22] <mawk> I see
[05:03:25] <pikapika> mawk, I would be interested in the proofs for these facts
[05:03:33] <pikapika> I never studied continued fractions properly before
[05:03:44] <pikapika> Hadn't known such kinds of results were known for them
[05:03:55] <mawk> well in the continued fraction of an algebraic number it's always periodic
[05:04:02] <pikapika> Obviously
[05:04:09] <pikapika> I meant for square roots at least
[05:04:13] <pikapika> I haven't yet checked in general
[05:04:20] <mawk> well square roots and everything else algebraic
[05:04:28] <mawk> so the maximum number you can find in the continued fraction is bounded
[05:04:57] <mawk> and it's not the case with transcendental numbers, you can find numbers as big as you want
[05:05:15] <mawk> because if numbers were bounded it would have to be periodic which isn't possible
[05:05:19] <mawk> I think
[05:05:19] <beaky> nice i like algebra
[05:05:21] <pikapika> Interesting. I'll try seeing if I can prove the algebraic thing.
[05:05:28] <mawk> I think it's quite hard to prove
[05:05:29] <beaky> will you prove it in coq
[05:05:32] <mawk> but I don't remember exactly
[05:06:11] *** Joins: nekodesu (~nano@user/nekobit)
[05:06:47] <mawk> yeah no it doesn't have to be periodic if it's bounded nevermind
[05:07:02] <mawk> so, with some transcendantal numbers you can find numbers as big as you want
[05:07:32] <mawk> [1: 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, ...] isn't bounded but it's transcendental
[05:07:34] <mawk> is bounded*
[05:07:37] <pikapika> You mean the denominators keep increasing in a transcendental numbers expansion?
[05:07:39] <mawk> but it isn't periodic
[05:07:42] <pikapika> iusn';t that e
[05:07:47] <pikapika> that series you just gave
[05:07:48] <mawk> it's not called denominator but yes
[05:07:52] <mawk> they can keep increasing
[05:07:54] <mawk> ah, I don't know
[05:07:55] <pikapika> I'll have to check
[05:07:58] <mawk> I typed it at random

[05:11:23] <mawk> and I think it's wrong
[05:11:46] <mawk> there is nothing in the definition of a continued fraction that is stronger than the definition of a decimal number for instance
[05:11:54] <mawk> if you can write it as a decimal, you can do a continued fraction
[05:12:34] <mawk> and you don't have to be able to explicitly write it to give the continued fraction

[05:27:29] <vdamewood> It's definitely not easier than Mac.
[05:27:32] <pikapika> And I would say if there are any usability or otherwise issues, it would be because of lack of dogfooding
[05:28:13] <pikapika> When many devs are writing for linux on their macs, it should not be surprising that the output is not as good as it should be
[05:28:40] <cis> mac is my favorite distro
[05:28:48] <pikapika> And the other big equation is of course hardware vendors
[05:29:07] <vdamewood> Yeah, I'd say that developers aren't the kind of people whose input matters so much when it comes to GUIs.
[05:29:56] <pikapika> I'd say at least a "developer" minded person generally has better ideas for guis than "designers"
[05:30:07] <vdamewood> Developers designing GUIs is how you get obscure keystrokes and esoteric mouse hotspots for menus and such.

[08:56:41] <vdamewood> (You can't print a for-loop, but postscript still supports them.)
[08:57:47] <Izem> hmm, xml
[08:58:06] <Izem> presentation neutral is cool though
[08:58:10] <PlanckWalk> You can put hyperlinks in postscript documents.
[08:59:03] <PlanckWalk> There are all sorts of directives that are intended for different render targets, some of them are just comments from the processor point of view.
[09:00:23] <PlanckWalk> Whether a particular postscript-supporting system interprets or even passes them through is a bit of a can of worms though.
[09:00:35] <vdamewood> Hmm... one example I found uses what looks like a PDF extension.
[09:01:58] <PlanckWalk> Yes, and quite a few postscript processors will recognize (some of) those

[09:34:42] <JackFin> ok legit question: why do you need "exactness" in printing? cant you trade off some precision for flexibility in document format and have an easier time?

[09:35:31] <Izem> you really wouldn't notice it?
[09:35:33] <vdamewood> JackFin: 99.9% of your printing encompasses 0.0000001% of all printing. Most printing is done by professional outfits.
[09:36:15] <vdamewood> And yeah, they spend hours or even weeks treaking the layout of what they're printing to get it down to the 600-dbi dot.

[09:36:33] <JackFin> crazy..
[09:36:39] <vdamewood> s/dbi/dpi/
[09:37:02] <vdamewood> That's why apps like QuarkXpress and Adobe InDesign exist.
[09:37:08] <Izem> hmm, if I don't care about printing like html that would make it a lot easier to make a new document format
[09:37:45] <JackFin> imagine a version of Tex that was 'less exact'
[09:37:55] <JackFin> but still pretty good
[09:38:12] <Izem> what's the point of that?
[09:38:22] <Izem> TeX is for digital typesetting
[09:38:25] <JackFin> simplicity in the format 
[09:38:35] <JackFin> and standardization 
[09:38:59] <Izem> I don't think that's the issue at hand
[09:39:02] <vdamewood> TeX itself already is unsuitable as a printing format, like HTML. That's why TeX converts to another format.
[09:39:51] <Izem> now I see why they output to dvi
[09:40:04] <vdamewood> The point to TeX is that when it does render to the printable format, it does it correctly, where as other formats are less stringent on typesetting concepts like properly laying out the text and such.
[09:41:16] <vdamewood> Typesetters are really focused on typographic conerns like 'whitespace rivers' and odd quirks like that. TeX is designed to detect such things and avoid them. Most HTML printers don't cover that and use a simple, naïve, brute-force layout method.

[09:49:18] <Izem> I guess %20 is space in html
[09:49:28] <JackFin> nvm guess is unrelated (maybe)
[09:49:32] <cis> urlencoded
[09:49:36] <vdamewood> Izem: Not HTML.
[09:49:42] <Izem> oh
[09:49:46] <Caffeinated> x020 = 32 decimal which is space
[09:49:51] <Izem> I see
[09:49:54] *** audio is now known as audiocat
[09:49:55] <Izem> haha nice
[09:49:59] <cis> in html space is just space, or &nbsp;
[09:50:20] <vdamewood> Actually &nbsp; isn't a 'space' character (0x20), it's a Non-breaking space.
[09:50:31] <cis> yeah, a very hearty space
[09:50:45] <Caffeinated> its a space with bumps
[09:50:55] <cis> strong, unflappable, holds up under pressure
[09:51:08] <Izem> JackFin: that title may be incorrect
[09:51:14] <vdamewood> It's a space that can't be used as the point to start a new line if the text flow requires it.
[09:51:43] <cis> text flow is overrated; we have scrollbars for a reason!
[09:51:53] <vdamewood> So, if you write foo&nbsp;bar, then 'foo' and 'bar' will be on the same line of text.
[09:52:05] <Izem> ah cool
[09:52:09] *** Joins: bytecrawler (~bytecrawl@gateway/tor-sasl/bytecrawler)
[09:52:18] <Izem> vdamewood: btw do you know if troff was sent to a printer?
[09:52:40] <vdamewood> Unless, of course, the WHOLE line is full of NBSP's and you *have* to break somewhere.
[09:52:53] <vdamewood> Then each NBSP is as much as a candidate to break as any letter.
[09:53:19] <vdamewood> Izem: I think it was, and I think that's how K&R was produced.
[09:53:35] <Izem> cool :-)
[09:53:57] <vdamewood> Though, I'm fairly certain that recent printings have been converted to some other format to be used as a master.
[09:53:58] <Izem> pavonia: that's too bad, think someone would've spotted that before it was too late
[09:54:46] <pavonia> I'm pretty sure Knuth was aware of it :p
[09:54:53] <vdamewood> Or rather, I should say, recent printings are made from a digital master that was produced by converting the troff original.
[09:54:59] <Izem> kernighan and company also used custom software for the go programming language book too, troff and some other stuff
[09:55:40] <Izem> ok great, I'm starting to get the idea
[09:56:37] <Izem> for your document format it will be paired along with a veiwer
[09:57:10] <Izem> suitable formats for printing exist so it's best to translate to those for printing stuff
[09:57:53] <Izem> did hyperlinks appear in any form before html?
[09:59:07] <Izem> that is quite the idea/feature
[09:59:50] <vdamewood> I think TeXinfo predates HTML and had (internal) hyperlinks.
[10:00:27] <Izem> yeah that will also be one to look at
[10:01:25] <Izem> the trick now is to avoid recreating the web xD
[10:02:25] <vdamewood> So, I selected a Taylor Swift video on YouTube to watch, and after it's autoplaying other music videos. Of the last 8 or say, 7 have been more Taylor Swift videos. Randomly, one was Katy Perry.
[10:03:02] <Izem> it's a test to see if you will change it
[10:03:05] <Izem> xD
[10:03:26] <Izem> that way they can determine you preferences
[10:03:49] <vdamewood> Yeah, I won't. I like KP, too.

[11:05:24] <PlanckWalk> If you don't store it with the hash, you need to store it somewhere else.

[11:10:34] <Akronymus> It doesn't help with brute forcing your specific salt.
[11:10:52] <Akronymus> It helps with pre-computed tables of hashes + PW's

[12:53:11] <CuriousErnestBro> cool, not something I'm interested in tho
[12:53:18] <piou> mrig: the approach of SICP is to start with functionnal programming (it's all in scheme), see what kind of problems it can solve, what complexity is about, then introduce mutations, then how to deal with managing side effects notably in conccurent applications, how to build an object system, how to build an interpreter, how to build a compiler, how to build different kind of languages that have
[12:53:24] <piou> different properties (for example a prolog clone). It goes from physical problems (solving some differential equation by computation is one of the first things you do - and in a very simple approach) to getting you to think deeply about what a language is, what it proposes, what are its charateristics and how to design your own tools to achieve what you want.
[12:53:25] <merijn> mrig: I would say it's the opposite, it dives very deeply into the rabbit hole of parsing, because at the time parsing was *hard*

"fuzzy parsing"? As in, on one end I could just write 100s of "ifs" for each case I encounter, on the other I have ML/NNs (I guess) - is there something in between?

[13:11:12] <piou> Trieste: sounds like your best approach is to try and canonicalize (ie: transform all inputs into the same representation). Another approach would be statistical, either by using real statistics (I think you could wind up a bayesian network to try and identify what probability something has to be any given kind of field) or by producing lots of examples to train a neural network to recognize
[13:11:13] <mrig> right, I'm just pondering at the moment whether to generate ast for verification purposes or whether to make simple lookup tables.
[13:11:18] <piou> those. And these techniques may provide finer results than canonicalization, but if your input is ambiguous your output will always contain ambiguity and errors. Garbage in garbage out.

[13:21:38] <piou> Trieste: I mean, it's really hard to get precise without actually seing your problem, but is there a point during parsing where you can say "ok, that must not be it because it doesn't make sense now"? For example because you realize you don't have enough fields? In that case you could maybe have a probabilistic approach : this has 60% to follow the rule, I'll act as if it did for the moment, arg,

[13:33:47] <piou> My list would be... SICP, Game Programming Design Patterns, TAOCP, 500 lines or less, Don't Just Roll the Dice, Security Engineering, Computer Networks (by Tanenbaum).

[13:34:58] <piou> TAOCP barely makes the cut because it's so dense, but at the same time it's so fundational and good.

[14:18:29] <pyzozord> yeah Arahael said it much better
[14:18:52] <piou> Oh, that I think everybody does, that's a bad human habit. I just don't think mathematicians do it more than any other field. I do think however that many people that are not mathematicians build between themselves a wrong idea of what mathematicians do.
[14:20:10] <pyzozord> I'd argue that mathematicians have a bit more incentive to do it, since their field is surrounded by that aura of cleverness. Programmers too but to a lesser extent. But in general the difference is probably negligible between these fields and other fields. Yeah just ugly human habit
[14:20:22] <piou> For example the fact that it's very common to start talking about an unprovent work just because we have an intuition of how it can be proven and it feels easy. That's something mathematicians do a lot, that's just how the community works, and people will even do conferences to explain where they are in a proof even though nothing's actually proven yet.

[14:26:43] <pyzozord> there is that famous experiment about how culture gets perpetuated even when the reason was long gone https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PvBo75PDo
[14:26:59] <piou> That said, there have been plenty of cocky and arrogant mathematicians. One of my favourite is John Nash (that you may know from A Beautiful Mind). Once he was asked to solve a difficult issue of thermodynamics by a colleague mathematician. The problem was out of his main field so he didn't know how important a problem it was and didn't want to waste his time, so what he did is that he announced
[14:27:05] <piou> a few days later that he had solved it. When he saw the excitement and consternation of his colleagues he realized that the problem was the real deal and decided to solve it for real. Which he did, by slowly integrating everything he could about the field, by leveraging lots of colleagues from Princeton for specific parts of the proof and by inventing a completely new approach. Smart guy. When he
[14:27:05] <pyzozord> I think maybe those mathematicians who went through that "trial of fire" then are now perpetuating it
[14:27:11] <piou> got the Nobel Prize in Economy for the Nash equilibrium, the first thing that was said when announcing him to the stage for a speech was that this Nobel was given for the least of his accomplishments, and that's probably true.

[14:30:22] <mrig> John Nash, is a wonderful example of how the Indian science of time can be applied to understand our world; I will write this up someday.
[14:30:26] <pyzozord> arguing with strangers on the internet has no point if you are not looking to learn something new. The status you can "win" is worthless and gone tomorrow

[14:52:15] <user51> oh, damn.. well, someone will probably go wtf at that :D
[14:52:16] <d3x0r> ya, c# actually treates it as arguments to a get function
[14:52:19] <pyzozord> Tazmainian: that's product design decision. What do you want your user experience to be?
[14:52:42] <Tazmainian> pyzozord, well it's up in the air lol. So wonder what is better 
[14:52:44] <Akronymus> Tazmainian like so many things: It depends
[14:53:07] <pyzozord> Tazmainian: I think most people prefer to see all the error at once that saves them from correcting one thing, clicking again and seeing another bug

[14:53:31] <Akronymus> For forms and such, I'd probably gather up errors.
[14:53:35] <d3x0r> or seeing the error immediately as you get the onblur
[14:53:37] <Tazmainian> but that incurs more processing on your end 
[14:53:41] <mrig> Akronymus: well it is always good to check the language specification when dealing with memory in any language, where concurrency is concerned.
[14:53:48] <Tazmainian> well this is a json model sent up
[14:53:58] <Akronymus> For something like an API, I'd probably go with fail fast
[14:54:03] <mrig> C is no better or worse than any other language in that regard.

[15:05:46] <mrig> is duckduckgo a pointer to a pointer then?
[15:06:04] <Akronymus> Booo! mrig
[15:06:13] <Akronymus> That pun was horrible
[15:07:30] <user51> a pointer is a variable that holds a memory location
[15:07:41] <Akronymus> Exactly
[15:07:49] <Akronymus> It points to a location.
[15:07:53] <Akronymus> Hence the name
[15:08:03] <user51> an array describes a range of memory locations
[15:08:09] <GeDaMo> It's not quite that simple; on a Harvard architecture, code and data are in separate adress spaces
[15:08:45] <Akronymus> user51 not in c.
[15:09:00] <Akronymus> In c, it has no knowledge about the range.

[15:37:07] <mrig> pyzozord: I am wanting to avoid making a parser generator, unless it really is the logical solution.
[15:37:56] <mrig> Am trying with control flow, which is moving the part of the code from my lexing code out, which is good, seems that this is on the right track.
[15:38:24] <pyzozord> I second that question then. One thing to comes to mind as an alternative is to use some ready made parser generator instead of writing one yourself. Another thing to write a parser manually. I personally want to write a parser manually as my first parser
[15:38:24] <merijn> mrig: BNF aren't detailed enough for most grammars
[15:38:56] <mrig> I noticed that there is EBNF or BNFE with some regexp type operators added.

[15:39:17] <merijn> recursive descent parsers are probably the simplest/easiest to implement
[15:39:51] <pyzozord> yeah that backtracking + recursive descent parser seemed like a pretty powerful way of parsing stuff. I think that's also the most easy/classical way to do it. So I want to implement that

[16:25:07] <merijn> pyzozord: Right. So every BNF has a "start" which then has 1 or more alternatives (which in turn are specified using other alternatives or "terminal" symbols), right?
[16:25:22] <sjmulder> piou, I'll try that then. but will also check what e.g. the Elementary folks are doing
[16:26:02] <pyzozord> merijn: yep I always liked that idea with alternatives. I thought it was clever. I learned about the official name for "terminals" and "nonterminals" last week, or two weeks ago
[16:26:57] <merijn> So if you have a BNF like "Expr ::= Num | Add", "Num ::= [0-9]+", "Add ::= Mul '+' Expr", "Mul ::= Num '*' Num | Num", right?

[16:28:21] <merijn> pyzozord: A recursive descent parser would have a function "Num" that parses a Num terminal and returns an int, "Mul()" which would try to either 1) parse a Num, then *, then another Num and if that fails, parse just Num, etc.

[16:28:36] <mrig> All the literature seems marred in unnecessary complexity.
[16:28:45] <merijn> pyzozord: So you end with a starting function Expr() that (recursively) calls the other parsers and backtracks if one of them fails
[16:29:15] <merijn> pyzozord: Hence "recursive descent", you start at the top and try incrementally parse alternatives and if one fails you backtrack and try the next option
[16:29:22] <pyzozord> I like what wikipedia says "mutually recursive procedures (or a non-recursive equivalent) where each such procedure implements one of the nonterminals of the grammar". I think that makes sense. I imagine lots of functions like a function expr() that inside tries to run num() and op() etc
[16:29:35] <merijn> pyzozord: Right
[16:29:36] <pyzozord> and at the very bottom some of these functions are terminal and they are just regexes
[16:29:53] <merijn> pyzozord: That's exactly what it is, plus some bookkeeping for errors and where in the input you are
[16:30:05] <pyzozord> yeah that seems supper cool

[16:30:51] <pyzozord> I need to write a backtracking + recursive descent. this seems a whole lot like a sudoku solver except instead of trying a number it executes this chain of functions that eventually call functions with regexes
[16:31:38] <gitesh> I think programming means 2 things
[16:31:41] <pyzozord> I'm very excited about this. This seems like fairly simple idea. I feel like this is 50% of what compilers are about :D
[16:31:47] <gitesh> 1 is data and the other is tools
[16:31:55] <pyzozord> well I'm of course exadurating, but this idea feels like it can take you very far
[16:31:59] <gitesh> We use tools to process data
[16:32:03] <merijn> mrig: That's because the people who know and learn this stuff mostly learn it in university classes where the professors explains the terminology
[16:32:16] <mrig> pyzozord: Like stepping through the options in a switch statement.
[16:32:49] <pyzozord> merijn: yep and recurse
[16:33:02] <pyzozord> so it essentially tries all possible interpretations of everything
[16:33:03] <merijn> mrig: Nobody's writing blogposts about this stuff, because people who wanna know about compilers either take a class on it OR buy one of the books used for these classes and read those
[16:33:12] <mrig> merijn: yes I get that, seems to over complicate the subject at times though.
[16:33:23] <merijn> mrig: So if you try and learn by googling you get very disconnected information with lots of gaps
[16:33:24] <pyzozord> what I am wondering is: what if it finds multiple valid interpretations?
[16:33:43] <merijn> pyzozord: Then your grammar is ambiguous
[16:34:03] <merijn> pyzozord: Ambiguous grammars are a thing (i.e. grammars with multiple valid parses for the same input)
[16:34:06] <pyzozord> ah so it's a design error then?
[16:34:17] <mrig> merijn: learning by way of k'n'r and k'n'd at the moment, am happy with the progress that is bringing about :D

[16:34:45] <merijn> In general, you don't want ambiguous grammars for programming languages
[16:34:56] <merijn> You want one (and only one) valid parse for every correct input
[16:35:33] <mrig> googling is awful for learning yes, good books are far better.
[16:35:35] <merijn> mrig: tbh, the actual books aren't that hard. They're usually aimed at undergrad students who aren't exactly experts :p
[16:35:43] <mrig> thus my questions this morning.
[16:36:01] <pyzozord> I imagined my full simplest parser would be backtracking + recursive descend + tree of big hashtables of symbols (each table would be one name scope)
[16:36:04] <beaky> why does vscode have lower input latency than temacs
[16:36:08] <beaky> than emacs*
[16:36:22] <merijn> mrig: Our compiler course had 3rd year undergrads write a compiler (from parser all the way to code generation in a custom assembly language) in about 3 months of 20 hours per week
[16:36:37] <merijn> mrig: And that's a pretty complex language too
[16:36:39] <pyzozord> so I'd try to resolve ambigiuities with the symbol table, because maybe some types of variables are invalid in this pattern etc
[16:36:39] <mrig> most books are pretty crap though.

[16:37:21] <mobidrop> beaky, does it? :D
[16:37:27] <merijn> pyzozord: Normally you build an AST first (so an abstract tree of your grammar) and then implement the lookup of names and typechecking on that tree

[16:37:48] <mrig> merijn: unless writing for forth :p
[16:37:52] <merijn> pyzozord: This makes scoping easy, because you can recursively walk the tree and add/remove new variables from the active scope as you recurse

[16:46:00] <bjs> pyzozord: specifically an ambiguous grammar means there are multiple parse trees for some inputs, whether those separate parse trees represent different ASTs is a question of language design not just parser design
[16:46:35] <bjs> pyzozord: e.g. a grammar where `a+b+c` can parse in two different ways might both give the same `OpAdd([a,b,c])` AST if the AST doesn't encode the associativity for example

[17:47:38] <mrig> regular expressions describe the expressions that fit within the grammar that is being parsed, if it triggers an error then the expression is irregular.

[19:17:48] <xheimlic1> I originally wanted to learn a little about sqlite and graph stuff with networkx. Like "let's try that this evening, slap on a Streamlit magic front-end".
[19:18:48] <xheimlic1> But then what started as "which tv show characters relate to which" became my brain backup, if it makes any sense. "Zettelkasten" is a fashionable term, although it's not really the same methodology.

[19:20:55] <xheimlic1> to answer your question, WarauSalesman. I think the project is still growing in scope and power, and when trying to Make a Design I keep wanting to leave a lot of leg room. 
[19:21:33] <xheimlic1> The only programming I know professionally is doing small services behind HTTP APIs which have neat boundaries.

[22:14:20] <beaky> in general difficulties can arise when the particular interface / trait composes poorly for example if your trait is defined in a way where one implementations requires or shares (possibly complex) state with another implementation. for example a trait that requires an arena like say a flywieght or a garbage colelctable heap store, (1) these may not compose well at all you will either be
[22:14:22] <beaky> creating this state per every implementing object or (2) sharing this among several or maybe all possible implementations which can be very complex

[22:28:48] <piou> CuriousErnestBro: and that tells me that you're not even on the right protocol right now because you just described an *authorization* protocl (oauth2) and not an authentication one

[22:51:39] <cis> [itchyjunk]: Java is survivable.
[22:51:56] <CuriousErnestBro> Izem I bet there was a time when youtube tutorials where you got spoonfed were more helpful :)
[22:52:05] <CuriousErnestBro> at least that time existed for me
[22:52:15] <CuriousErnestBro> now I love the docs, and find videos a waste of time 
[22:52:16] <Izem> I have never watched youtube tutorials
[22:52:23] <[itchyjunk]> cis, i hope so
[22:52:25] <[itchyjunk]> :<
[22:52:34] <Izem> I only started programing 4 years ago
[22:52:40] <GeDaMo> [itchyjunk]: what other languages do you know?
[22:52:50] <[itchyjunk]> I don't really know any language
[22:52:56] <CuriousErnestBro> I have, by a dude who taught c++ his name was thenewboston
[22:53:03] <[itchyjunk]> i've tried py,lisp,haskell, php 
[22:53:13] <Izem> you'd probably like haskell
[22:53:14] <[itchyjunk]> i made a irc bot in py recently
[22:53:24] <[itchyjunk]> i did kinda like haskell but it was also hard :P
[22:53:30] <Izem> oh lol
[22:53:31] <[itchyjunk]> but seemed useful for my algebra classes
[22:53:53] <CuriousErnestBro> actually systemd is more unix-way than what we had before, because systemd is a single program which handles daemonization well, unlike having similar (but not the same) code in each program willing to daemonize itself
[22:54:24] <GeDaMo> Java syntax is inspired by C and C++
[22:54:27] <[itchyjunk]> My home computer is crap but i have a free oracle VPS. I guess i should set up java there right?
[22:54:29] <Izem> there it is folks, haskell is hard we have evidence now :D
[22:54:39] <[itchyjunk]> would compiling java in ubuntu vs windows make a difference?
[22:54:44] <[itchyjunk]> for submitting hw and such
[22:54:46] <GeDaMo> It shouldn't
[22:54:46] <Izem> nope
[22:54:50] <CuriousErnestBro> [itchyjunk] ayyy the 24gb ram thing?
[22:54:51] <[itchyjunk]> ah good
[22:54:58] <Izem> they are probably really going to depend on an ide
[22:55:03] <[itchyjunk]> yes i think they give 24gb ram
[22:55:09] <Izem> eclipse I imagine
[22:55:13] <[itchyjunk]> oh ohh
[22:55:15] <CuriousErnestBro> I have it too, oracle is a great company
[22:55:16] <GeDaMo> One of Java's original selling points was 'write once, run anywhere'
[22:55:21] <[itchyjunk]> is eclipse available for ubuntu?
[22:55:24] <GeDaMo> It wasn't true but it sounded good :P
[22:55:25] <Izem> yeah
[22:55:29] <[itchyjunk]> phew
