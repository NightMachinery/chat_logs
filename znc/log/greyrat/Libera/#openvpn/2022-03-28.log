[16:25:30] <drew> I am trying to setup openvpn to forward traffic through my home server. This is the client config: http://dpaste.com/37BPBMVD5, this is the server config: http://dpaste.com/75BDSRA5V, and this is the client log for when I try to connect: http://dpaste.com/33B3EN9BL
[16:27:03] <ordex> !serverlan
[16:27:04] <vpnHelper> ordex: (#1) for a lan behind a server, the server must have ip forwarding enabled (!ipforward), the server needs to push a route for its lan to clients, and the router of the lan the server is on needs a route added to it (!route_outside_openvpn), or (#2) Handy troubleshooting flowchart: http://www.ircpimps.org/serverlan.png
[16:30:51] <drew> !ipforward
[16:30:53] <vpnHelper> drew: (#1) ip forwarding is needed any time you want packets to flow from 1 interface to another, so from tun to eth, eth to tun, tun to tun, etc etc. it must be enabled in the kernel AND allowed in the firewall, or (#2) please choose between !linipforward !winipforward !osxipforward and !fbsdipforward
[16:31:09] <drew> !linipforward
[16:31:10] <vpnHelper> drew: (#1) echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward for a temp solution (til reboot) or set net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1 in sysctl.conf for perm solution, or (#2) chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.ip_forward for perm solution in slackware, or (#3) you also must allow forwarding in your forward chain in iptables. iptables -I FORWARD -i tun+ -j ACCEPT

[16:35:38] <vpnHelper> drew: (#1) If your server is not the default gateway for the LAN, you will need to add routes to your gateway.

[16:43:17] <drew> do most routers have the ability to add routes? I have Google Wifi and it looks like that's not an option I can find
[16:45:10] <drew> also the flow chart suggests if I can't add a route to the router that I should add a route to the lan machine. In my server config I have push "route 192.168.86.0 255.255.255.0", so isn't that pushing a route to the lan subnet?
[16:47:23] <drew> I can ping 192.168.86.68, which is the ip of the openvpn server computer, but I can't ping 192.168.86.1, which is the gateway, if that helps
[16:52:07] <ordex> drew: 192.168.86.1 need to know how to reach the IP creating the ping (I guess it's the VPN IP of the host sending the ping)
[16:52:11] <ordex> *needs
[16:52:18] <ordex> for that it needs a route to the VPN network
[16:52:51] <ordex> you can achieve that by adding a route on the LAN GW (because all traffic passes through it) or you have to add a route to the LAN machine that you want to reach
[16:59:57] <Pippin_> or the nathack...
[17:00:01] <Pippin_> !nathack
[17:00:02] <vpnHelper> Pippin_: see https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/NatHack for info on how to solve the problem when you need !route_outside_ovpn but cant add a route to the gateway or the lan machines
[17:01:11] <drew> I can't find any settings for adding routes to the gateway (Google WiFi router), so is there a way I can forward through the server's LAN ip? So like ping 192.168.86.1 from my laptop which has VPN IP of 10.8.0.3, ping goes to 10.8.0.1 which is the OpenVPN server that has 192.168.86.68 on local LAN, then ping goes to 192.168.86.1 and it sends response to 192.168.86.68 and OpenVPN forwards it to 10.8.0.3
[17:03:24] <drew> oh, reading the nathack doc sounds like what I want
[17:04:09] <drew> sounds like it's an unfavorable solution tho lol. Do most consumer routers have the ability to add routes? Is it strange I can't on mine?
[17:05:05] <ordex> drew: yeah, you can do NAT. that wil avoid you setting up routing in the LAN
[17:05:24] <ordex> drew: most routers I have seen allow you to add static routes, yes
[17:05:48] <ordex> drew: some provider locked routers though expose only basic features so that the provider does not need to support customers when doing something weird/wrong
[17:08:37] <drew> argh
[17:14:36] <ordex> but I never used the Google WiFi Router, so no clue about it
[17:19:37] <drew> some google results seem to say that I can't add static routes to Google WiFi/Nest
[17:22:44] <Pippin_> if it's 1, 2 or 3 machine(s) on the lan you want to reach then setting routes on 1/2/3 might be favorable, that is if thoe allow you to set routes
[17:23:06] <Pippin_> *those
[17:28:44] <ordex> or just do NAT on the VPN server ... (unless this creates more troubles for you)

[21:14:27] <rob0> Routing is done based on destination IP address normally, not on source address nor intermediate address.
