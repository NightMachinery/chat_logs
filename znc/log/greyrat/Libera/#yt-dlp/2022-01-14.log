[08:30:03] <pystardust> hey, I really love the project and want to learn how it works, any recommendation on learning how it works? or should i just try to understand the source directly

[10:46:58] <ede> pystardust: https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#developer-instructions
[10:47:37] <ede> that's about adding a new site (you could run a local server, so at least you know what's going on) and do it there
[10:48:29] <ede> also maybe look to some of the smaller extractors, i wouldn't go with youtube first xD

[15:58:54] <pystardust> ede: thanks, i was looking at the extractors with the lowest number of lines, i think i get that part, i wanna understand how the different parts of it, but the program is very nested, I havn't been jumping around from module to module, its wonderful!
[15:59:52] <ede> indeed, i wanted to check the different methods already sites use for their datakeeping, but... ya know.
[16:02:45] <pystardust> it would be nice if the code has seperate documentation or more documentation on it's structure
[16:03:24] <pystardust> like understandin each fn is fine, but understanding the whole picture is a bit difficult

[18:35:19] <ede> youtube-dl seems to have been mostly a one-man show for years, i didn't care about -dlc and other things, no need for frontends and other things.
[18:36:03] <ede> also i didn't check who was contributing what, just had the impression people could add new extractors, and there's really a lot of them
[18:36:31] <ede> it just worked, had its flaws, but ok.
[18:37:35] <ede> only when sites changed something the extractor had to be modified, i only used it for youtube and a handful other sites and the tv stations i get here. pure convenience.
[18:38:37] <ede> and sometimes they just change things forth and back, as if they wouldn't really know where they want to go to.
[18:39:21] <ede> basically it's "get the website, rip off the data block or the info how to get it and do so"
[18:39:28] <ede> err webpage
[18:40:18] <ede> looked into some html sources then, sometimes it's really just isolating some json near the end of the page.

[19:26:35] <ede> uff. youtube-dl's extractor/ (december version, which should be mostly the same as june) has 786 of them, yt-dlp 100 more already :o
