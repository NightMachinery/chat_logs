[13:23:30] <faceface> bah sorry, my session got closed yesterday (thanks mosh) and I don't see logs for some reason
[13:23:57] <faceface> I came in and said the following:
[13:24:01] <faceface> I'm reading about docker for production and testing here: 
[13:24:03] <faceface> https://medium.com/vteam/configure-docker-project-for-different-environments-using-docker-compose-3-bfbef37d951c
[13:24:31] <faceface> but his solution looks a bit ugly... `RUN if [ "$NODE_ENV" = "development" ]; ...`
[13:24:36] <faceface> Is there a cleaner way, or is this as good as it gets?
[13:26:00] <faceface> Because I run tests that rely on packages that only exist in 'npm install --only=production', I'd have to write that construct at least twice in my docker file... It's going to get messy fast...
[13:26:18] <faceface> Should I do the check with Node rather than Docker?

[16:44:59] <CSWookie> I'm trying and failing to set up an nfs volume via docker-compose on OSX.  Is there a plugin I need to install?  Can I get it via brew?
[16:45:49] <faceface> CSWookie: to see if I understand, you want your container to mount an NFS file system?
[16:45:55] <faceface> Or what is your commandline?
[16:47:02] <faceface> docker volume create ...?
[16:47:25] <CSWookie> Yes.  I want the container to mount an nfs file system.  I'm trying to do it via docker-compose.  If there's a pastebin the channel uses I can put the file in there.
[16:48:17] <faceface> So within the container you run `RUN mount ...`, and that step fails... what is the error?
[16:48:29] <greatgatsby> CSWookie, maybe not the answer you want, but I've had success simply mounting remote filesystems on the docker host, then bind mounting them like any other directory
[16:49:11] <faceface> https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/#create-a-service-which-creates-an-nfs-volume ?
[16:51:27] <CSWookie> faceface I'll give it a shot to determine things can work, I suppose.  I'll eventually need to put it in a docker-compose.yml that can work both on OSX and on a Centos8 box.

[18:36:35] <programmerq> briian▸ the --compress option only enables compression for the build context, not the final image. It'll mostly be helpful in a situation where you're running the 'docker build' command against a remote dockerd backend and the context is large enough that it will make a difference to compress it to save time during the "sending build context" step.
[18:38:08] <briian> ah ok thanks, been tasked with looking into compressing images but don't know a whole lot about compression or the images so trying to do it bit by bit

[18:38:34] <programmerq> image compression really only happens when you push it to an image registry.

[18:39:35] <programmerq> I'm not aware of a way to change the compression on the registry side of things.
[18:40:18] <programmerq> but for locally available images in a dockerd, those just get stored in the docker storage driver. overlay2 is the most common, and it's just files on disk-- no compression.
[18:40:32] *** Joins: vxrx (~vxrx@209.141.36.56)
[18:40:33] <briian> gotcha, we do use a registry so that must be where I should be looking
[18:40:58] <programmerq> docker does have a zfs driver, and you can enable zfs compression on a dataset, but it is pretty much just a fast compression that doesn't have a fantastic ratio.
[18:43:13] *** Joins: trevors (~trevors@c-65-96-171-157.hsd1.ma.comcast.net)
[18:43:38] <programmerq> it looks like you can use skopeo to control a bit about the compression that gets used. skopeo is a tool that lets you interact with docker/oci registries and do stuff like copy/download/push without an actual dockerd involved. Its help info has a few options that mention compression. It looks like you can choose between gzip and zstd and set a compression level.

[22:15:30] <programmerq> all nodes should appear in 'docker node ls'
[22:17:56] <orion> programmerq: But it doesn't. "8762018d2d47" is nowhere to be found in that list.
[22:18:08] <orion> Moreover, the format of the key in the log message is different than the format of the IDs in that list.

[22:26:10] <ada_> orion: I believe that node ID comes from gossip
[22:26:23] <ada_> orion: but the IP address should be able to tell you which node is the "failed" node
[22:26:24] <orion> How do I troubleshoot the gossip cluster?
[22:26:33] <ada_> orion: you don't, it's not really exposed to the user 
[22:26:38] <orion> The IP is not valid.
[22:26:44] <ada_> what does that mean
[22:26:55] <orion> I believe someone misconfigured the advertisement IP address of a swarm worker.
[22:27:51] <orion> As a result, my logs are flooded with messages such as "Node 8762018d2d47/10.156.0.16, joined gossip cluster" and "Node 8762018d2d47 change state NodeActive --> NodeFailed"
[22:28:10] <ada_> which node is "down" in docker node ls?
[22:28:53] <orion> There are four.
[22:30:41] <programmerq> yeah, doing some digging, that type of message does come from the libnetwork stuff, not the swarmkit stuff. I do see those IDs in 'docker network inspect -v ingress' but that's a moderately indirect way to see the network status.
[22:31:01] *** Joins: Tabstar (~tabmow@user/tabmow)
[22:31:14] <programmerq> the node ip address should help you identify the actual problem node.

[22:31:40] <orion> programmerq: I believe that IP address I am seeing is not the IP address from which packets are arricing.
[22:31:44] <orion> arriving*
[22:32:17] <ada_> you normally wouldn't set --advertise-addr when joining a node to a swarm
[22:32:45] <programmerq> if you only have four to look at, see which one of those four has that --advertise-addr 10.156.0.16
[22:33:08] <orion> This command returns nothing: "docker node ls -q | xargs -n 1 docker node inspect | grep 10.156.0.16"
[22:33:22] *** Tabstar is now known as Tabmow
[22:34:09] <orion> This command also returns nothing: "docker network inspect -v ingress | grep 10.156.0.16"
[22:35:12] <programmerq> okay... log in to the four "down" nodes and see if any of those have anything in their logs
[22:39:23] <orion> I've removed all four "Down" nodes and the log messages keep occurring.
[22:39:31] <orion> e.g. "docker node rm ..."
[22:42:45] <programmerq> try logging in to 10.156.0.16 to inspect what it is doing?
