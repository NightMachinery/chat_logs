[01:53:24] <theskillwithin> i think some apps that use graphql might use it
[01:54:05] <l__q> Hmm, but why isn't popular at all? Prisma is rly greet tool to work with databases

[05:33:45] <gehn> nosql isn't even actually a thing, because no one can define it
[05:33:58] <gehn> it's a useless term for any kind of actual productive discussion
[05:34:16] <gehn> do you need "nosql"? never. do you have a use case for a document store or kv store? sure, maybe, but also probably not.
[05:36:13] <gehn> "schemaless" is also a myth and a lie. you always have a schema, otherwise it would be impossible to do anything useful with your data
[05:36:41] <systemfault> schemaless just means that your schema is enforced using your own code... which is more error-prone
[05:36:50] <gehn> ^

[05:39:56] <gehn> redis is also fine, though postgres can do what redis does with hstore, pubsub and in memory tables

[06:41:21] <sickdyd> We are building a template website with Next.js that will be used for 3 different brands. The idea is to dynamically load assets and have slight different layouts for each brand (probably based on the URL of the request). Do you think it could work or do you see pitfalls?

[11:11:41] <ljharb> which behavior
[11:12:06] <Maxdamantus> the special behaviour of `String.prototype.split` when given an empty string.
[11:12:36] <Maxdamantus> The logical way of splitting by an empty string will result in an infinite array of empty strings.
[11:12:46] <Maxdamantus> so it should probably just be an error.
[11:12:55] <sickdyd> sheetjs: yeah, never used it though ;>
[11:13:55] <sheetjs> it wouldnt Maxdamantus
[11:14:24] <IceMichael> and even if you have a use case for it, you need to put a comment because this behaviour is unclear/unexpected, so it's even for that use case mediocrely helpful
[11:14:30] <Maxdamantus> It would. The normal behaviour of splitting by a string is to find the first occurence of the search string, and split at that point.
[11:14:40] <Maxdamantus> The first occurence of the empty string is always at index 0.
[11:15:01] <Maxdamantus> JS just has some special behaviour for splitting by empty strings. It's different to any other split.
[11:15:17] <Maxdamantus> eg, `a.split("")[0].length == 1`

[11:21:17] <pavonia> Maxdamantus: Can you name one example? For example, Haskell's splitOn behaves similarily to JS' split

[11:39:53] <sheetjs> but python is a bad example because, as it currently stands, the spec has undefined behavior
[11:40:26] <pavonia> Even if disallowing empty split strings would be "more correct", it would be considered less practical and unexpected by many. So I don't really see the point in arguing against it
[11:40:45] <Maxdamantus> I wouldn't say it has undefined behaviour. It's specified in such a way that it can't return anything when splitting by the empty string, so it must throw or crash or go into a loop or something.
[11:41:24] *** Joins: Booster2ooo (~Booster2o@user/booster2ooo)
[11:41:33] <sheetjs> it absolutely has undefined behavior.  you cannot look at the text of string.split documentation and discern how the empty string case should be handled
[11:42:22] <Maxdamantus> Well, it's not real UB. You can basically assume that a Python function will throw if it can't do the thing it's specified as doing.
[11:42:40] <Maxdamantus> It's not going to have some random arbitrary behaviour.
[11:42:46] <sheetjs> there is a coherent logic to how javascript string splits and joins work
[11:43:00] <sheetjs> there's a theoretical framework complete with intuitive invariants
[11:43:05] <Maxdamantus> So why does it have special logic for empty strings?
[11:43:14] <sheetjs> its not special logic
[11:43:34] <Maxdamantus> https://262.ecma-international.org/12.0/#sec-string.prototype.split
[11:43:45] <Maxdamantus> > a. a. If R is not the empty String, then
[11:43:55] <Maxdamantus> then it does something else

[11:45:10] <pavonia> Too bad it doesn't go into an infinite loop on empty strings, that would be a joy for every programmer :S
[11:45:15] <sheetjs> statement 11 is
[11:45:34] <sheetjs> if s = 0, where s is the length of the haystack
[11:45:45] *** Joins: kuler (~kulernil@gateway/tor-sasl/kuler)
[11:46:00] <sheetjs> it's literally distinguishing betwee

[11:46:06] <jellobot> (okay) []
[11:46:13] <sheetjs> n> "".split("blah")
[11:46:14] <jellobot> (okay) [ '' ]
[11:46:58] <sheetjs> this actually follows from the second invariant
[11:47:09] <sheetjs> first invariant: a.split(b).join(b)==a
[11:47:16] <Maxdamantus> 19:05:21 < Maxdamantus> also, another weird thing about splitting by the empty string is that it can return an empty list.
[11:47:40] <sheetjs> second invariant: a.split(b).filter(x => x.includes(b)).length == 0
[11:48:11] <sheetjs> it wouldn't make sense for the array to include the string you are splitting on
[11:48:29] <Maxdamantus> sheetjs: but every string returned in this case does.
[11:48:34] <Maxdamantus> sheetjs: every string contains the empty string.
[11:48:44] <Maxdamantus> sheetjs: how's that for a broken invariant?
[11:48:47] <sheetjs> the empty string does not contain any string other than the empty string
[11:48:49] <sheetjs> you flipped it
[11:49:12] <Maxdamantus> a.split(b).every(s => s.indexOf(b) < 0)
[11:49:12] <sheetjs> "".split(s) is expected to satisfy "".split(s).join(s) == ""
[11:49:35] <Maxdamantus> sheetjs: you're just making stuff up that matches JS' behaviour.
[11:49:47] <sheetjs> this isn't just symbols
[11:49:50] <sheetjs> in words
[11:50:09] <sheetjs> first invariant: if you split a string then join on the same delimiter, you expect to get back the original string
[11:50:26] <sheetjs> second invariant: if you split a string on a delimiter, none of the parts should contain that delimiter
[11:50:43] <Maxdamantus> sheetjs: but `a.split("")` breaks the second invariant.
[11:50:55] <Maxdamantus> sheetjs: your second invariant is what I just wrote in code.

[22:55:54] <systemfault> reduce is the most generic of the iteration methods... should be used only if no other function works
[22:57:31] <Intelo> ljharb ok so prettier is not even needed? what do you use for formatting?

[22:59:21] <GreenJello> Intelo, if you want (nearly) total formatting, you can use the prettier plugin for eslint if you also want the more advanced fixes eslint provides
[23:02:16] <systemfault> I personally prefer eslint + prettier, but like GreenJello said, you do need the eslint prettier plugin or they conflict with each other

[23:04:44] <Intelo> GreenJello systemfault I see. So how important is it to have the pretter or some formatter in place (also it should be consistent with configs for all team members)
[23:05:17] <foureyes> prettier ftw
[23:05:19] <Intelo> Is wanting to have nearly total formatting a good thing, a needless thing or madatory or ..
[23:05:32] <foureyes> it's a load off your mind
[23:05:34] <GreenJello> it's optional, but it's nice to not argue about minor formatting
[23:05:35] <Intelo> or its just a matter of taste and not best practices
[23:05:37] <systemfault> Intelo: It avoids useless discussions and let the team focus on what matters.
[23:05:40] <foureyes> ^
[23:06:07] <Intelo> systemfault ah. I think thats their slogan too :)
[23:06:08] <Intelo> ok.

[23:07:29] <systemfault> With the "format on save" option in VSCode, it's a really nice experience (IMHO)
[23:07:44] <silly_> also, you don't want code style commits
[23:07:58] <silly_> keep everything always 100% formatted

[23:08:53] <Intelo> systemfault I assume that vscode option does the pretier plugin of eslint thing under the hood
