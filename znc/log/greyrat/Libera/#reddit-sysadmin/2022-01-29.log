[00:02:09] <Hunterkll> @sysadmin smart card isn't either
[00:02:13] <Hunterkll> because those were unauth exploits....

[00:48:20] <Hunterkll> ender: nah but i got it building in VS 2019 
[00:48:23] <ender> I used it back in the day, but switched since it had no UTF-8 support
[00:48:32] <Hunterkll> been working on tweaking and updating all the libraries 
[00:48:38] <Hunterkll> and forward porting it to all the goodness 
[00:48:42] <ender> I liked the interface a lot
[00:48:57] <ender> (but AdiIRC is very similar, and much more configurable)
[00:49:09] <Hunterkll> well
[00:49:14] <Hunterkll> everything's configurable at the source layer
[00:49:15] <Hunterkll> :P
[00:49:45] <ender> AdiIRC isn't opensource, but the author seems to have similar mindset to me
[00:49:46] <Hunterkll> probably going to start moving some functions into WinRT instead of Win32 (which'll put me at a Windows 8.0 baseline support but it's for the better) and adding dumb shit 
[00:49:50] <Hunterkll> like VoIRC support 
[00:49:51] <Hunterkll> lol
[00:49:59] <haise01> I think you gave me entire source with that 50 MB zip lol
[00:50:03] <ender> every single thing that I ever wanted to configure it has an option for
[00:50:25] <Hunterkll> haise01: yea then i gave you the ri ght zip, i gave you build/debug artifacts in the first one

[00:52:31] <ender> I see no high-DPI support :)
[00:52:49] <Hunterkll> took me a fucking long ass night of like 18 hours to get it to build at all :P
[00:53:01] <Hunterkll> my first goal is going to be 64-bit native over any features, i think
[00:53:08] <haise01> do 64-bit native first
[00:53:20] <Hunterkll> that way it'll work on server core with 32-bit support removed
[00:53:25] <Hunterkll> :D
[00:53:42] <haise01> you also need to update libs right ?
[00:53:50] <Hunterkll> across the board, lots of shit to do
[00:54:05] <haise01> yeah I would make 64-bit native and updating libs my top priority right now
[00:54:12] <haise01> and then save rest for later

[05:00:22] <Hunterkll> since I refuse to use USB-C docks due to reliability issues compared to thunderbolt based ones
[05:00:51] <Kiernian> hrm. that's interesting. are docking station ports on the bottoms of, say, lenovo laptops DMA?
[05:01:16] <PrincessZoey> this is supposed to be thunderbolt 3
[05:01:21] <Kiernian> because thunderbolt/firewire is direct memory access, usb is not, and every problem i've had with a port replicator I've never had with a docking station on a docking port
[05:01:32] <Hunterkll> huh?
[05:01:38] <Hunterkll> thunderbolt is basically just hotplug PCIe
[05:02:00] <Hunterkll> and lenovo laptops use usb-c docks now 
[05:02:04] <Hunterkll> docking port's gone there
[05:02:05] <Hunterkll> gone on dell too 
[05:02:06] <Hunterkll> etc
[05:02:26] <Kiernian> ThunderboltTM connections are capable of direct memory access (DMA) via a Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) connection, and Thunderbolt™ ports are the only externally accessible ports on modern PCs that offer this capability.
[05:02:48] <Hunterkll> yes... like i said, hotplug pcie.... hook up GPUs, network cards, whatever..
[05:02:52] <sd> 11<H​otmess> pretty sure usb 3.0 is capable of rdma
[05:03:10] <Kiernian> yeah, hence my curiosity on the subject
[05:03:41] <Hunterkll> can't be hotplug pcie without all pcie features
[05:03:47] <Hunterkll> otherwise GPUs et al wouldn't work properly
[05:03:56] <Kiernian> I suppose the question is, what TYPE of DMA is it and what access does it actually have. would inception work on it or not is probably the test for that

[05:04:35] <Hunterkll> yes yes, if you don't configure shit properly, etc

[05:05:21] <sd> 11<H​otmess> most of the time new hardware standards are "huh neet"
[05:05:30] <Kiernian> dma is a HUGE exploit, 10 years ago you could use a firewire port on an os-level locked, drive encrypted machine, connecting it to another machine running inception, type incept unlock and have machine access. Which is why most os's remove the DMA component when a machine is locked now
[05:05:36] <sd> 11<H​otmess> there will be another one in 24 months
[05:05:53] <Hunterkll> 10 years ago firewire hardware was adopting appropriate protections and those attacks were becoming a thing of the past
[05:06:02] <Hunterkll> modern firewire has not these issues, unless you intentionally enable/open up them 
[05:06:07] <Kiernian> yup
[05:06:36] <Kiernian> there are still plenty of other dma issues. I think VT-d is used to mitigate some of them these days
[05:06:42] <Hunterkll> ah
[05:06:45] <Hunterkll> this is specific to USB shit
[05:07:22] <Hunterkll> so that thunderclap stuff also - that's OS level
[05:08:05] <Hunterkll> IOMMU exploits against OS level stuff, but then again, to get to that point, you have to be trusted/paired and validated on machines anyway....
[05:08:30] <Hunterkll> any modern consumer and fleet machine, you wouldn't be able to plug this device in and actually use it to exploit 
[05:08:34] <Hunterkll> unless the user allowed it 
[05:09:31] <Hunterkll> TL2 actually pairs the device with a specific key exchange so that only that actual physical device can work on the machine. You can't just clone the device ID and hope it's on the whitelist
[05:10:05] <Hunterkll> if you take a barracuda thunderbolt gaming dock and hook it up to my gaming laptop, it wo n 't work unless I log in a nd authorize it (or clone the device IDs to a malicious device)
[05:10:34] <Hunterkll> er, SL2
[05:10:35] <Hunterkll> https://www.dell.com/community/Latitude/Demystifying-Thunderbolt-3-Security-Levels/td-p/7529712
[05:11:30] <Hunterkll> SL1 and SL2 pretty much eliminate the feasibility of DMA exploits, unless in SL1 a user always allows a device and the attacker clones that device's IDs and serial/other identifying info
[05:11:41] <Hunterkll> SL2 uses cryptographic negotiation, so you can't really clone that part of the process
[05:12:16] <Hunterkll> almost everything is set to at least SL1 oout of the box 
[05:13:13] <Kiernian> cool
[05:13:18] <Hunterkll> By spec, that's supposed to be the out of box default since 2013. 
[05:13:43] <Hunterkll> And we know almost all PCs will be that way out of the box, since PC vendors skipped thunderbolt 2 for the most part and you basically jumped from TB1 to TB3 
[05:14:10] <Kiernian> That's... refreshing.
[05:15:33] *** Joins: SlaveGeek334269 (~root@li2114-242.members.linode.com)
[05:15:38] <Hunterkll> so yea, you can use OS level attacks against the IOMMU controlling kernel subsystem, sure..... if the device gets to that point 
[05:16:03] <Hunterkll> and again, the DMA attacks @Hotmess linked, are OS level attacks, not hands free OMG hog wild hardware level automatic everything
[05:16:21] <Kiernian> right
[05:16:25] <Hunterkll> which means that they can all be fixed/patched 
[05:17:22] <Hunterkll> of course, without VT-d, you're heavily reliant on OS IOMMU control..... TB4 will *require* VT-d based IOMMU isolation

[06:32:28] <Kiernian> if it won't dox you
[06:32:46] <Hunterkll> Kiernian: 1e nomad 
[06:32:58] <Hunterkll> that, and improvements in SCCM / branchcache sharing/etc
[06:33:25] <Hunterkll> 1E Nomad basically turned every system into an SCCM mini-DP that could find each other and pull content instead of from DPs/MSupdate/etc
[06:33:45] <Hunterkll> https://www.1e.com/products/nomad/
[06:34:30] <Kiernian> haha. yeah, the sccm side of things improving would have helped. I remember one particular spoke office that would go down if enough people in that area tried to work outside of the office and their machines pulled updates
[06:34:50] <Kiernian> had to remove them entirely as a patch option from the pool because it'd down their crappy T1
[06:34:57] <Hunterkll> for what it's worth, boatload of cache isn't how i'd describe that, i'd describe it as almost a rounding error.... (and we're talking 40k workstations & 5k servers type deal with multiple datacenters, multiple "cloud", all sorts of different connectivity links, etc)

[07:33:59] <MarsSpiral> is it a bad idea to message a former employee of a company to ask them of their experience

[07:35:07] <Kiernian> a former employee? Only way I can see that as an issue is if they inform their former employer of it and the employer decides they don't like it
[07:35:22] <MarsSpiral> honestly if they dont like it and decided not to hire me i wouldnt want to work there
[07:35:36] <MarsSpiral> the only iffy part is
[07:35:50] <MarsSpiral> he's listed as a current employee on linkedin, but everyone at the interview basically told me he left
[07:36:09] <MarsSpiral> very recently
[07:36:25] <Kiernian> probably hasn't gotten around to updating his linkedin yet
[07:36:58] <Kiernian> then again if "left very recently" means he's on vacation and hasn't been informed he's not got a job when it's over...
[07:37:22] <MarsSpiral> well I left it kinda vague
[07:37:27] <MarsSpiral> i sent him this
[07:38:07] <MarsSpiral> I'm XXXX, and I'm currently interviewing at XXXX. I saw you've worked at XXXX for 3 years.
[07:38:07] <MarsSpiral> If you don't mind me asking, can you tell me about your experiences at the company?
[07:38:07] <MarsSpiral> Would you recommend it as a place to work?
[07:38:24] <MarsSpiral> Basically saying i dont know if he's a former employee

[16:24:57] <LXGHTNXNG> > You can install DIMMs for microprocessor 2 as soon as you install microprocessor 2; you do not have to wait until all of the DIMM slots for microprocessor 1 are filled.
[16:25:12] <LXGHTNXNG> it seems to say nothing about needing equality
[16:25:18] <estranger> sounds like you can have a mismatch
[16:25:24] <estranger> agreed
[16:25:32] <LXGHTNXNG> A minimum of one DIMM must be installed for each microprocessor. For example, you must install a minimum of two DIMMs if the server has two microprocessors installed. However, to improve system performance, install a minimum of four DIMMs for each microprocessor.

[22:44:58] <sideup66> bit of a weird ask for you folks, can you start a windows 10 install from say a flash drive or whatever, do the first copying files part of it, and then on restart remove the install media from the computer and just have it boot up and finish without any install media attached? im not talking mdt or sccm deploy, just a vanilla windows install
[22:45:30] <radix0> yes and no
[22:46:21] <radix0> The default installer does not work this way, but you *can* make custom scripts to do this for you. I have done this before and at least when I tested it with USB 2 drives, it was no faster than just doing it "normally". That said if you have more computers than flash drives, I understand the desire.
[22:48:25] <sideup66> yeah this is a weird ask of a coworker, somehow family member or in law has a laptop with no working usb ports (im afraid to ask) and i had an idea of just kicking off the first part of the install with everything off a flash drive on a bench computer, then shutting it down, plugging into said computer, boot up and just finish
[22:48:30] <radix0> I actually have something "in the wild" at work that does exactly this. TLDR is step 1 - formats the target disk with all the partitions including a temporary partition at the end of disk. step 2 - copies the needed files (esd/wim) from the boot drive to the temporary partition. 3 - put message to the console to the operator that the drive can be removed 4 - start imaging using files in temp partition 5 - delete temp part, extend windows/local disk 
[22:48:30] <radix0> part to end of disk 6 - reboot
[22:48:43] <sideup66> i actually offered to him to sell him an old laptop im trying to sell on fb market
[22:49:01] <sideup66> hes gonna get back to me, cause that thing is ok, and i can throw the ssd in that, install win 10 with my mdt setup and be done with it
[22:49:01] <radix0> bench computer is probably the best option.
[22:50:10] <sideup66> hell even copy whatever itll need somewhere on the disk after the initial part, then a script on first boot to tell it to pull the rest from there

[23:54:03] <sd> 07<s​uttin> lol
[23:54:10] <sd> 07<s​uttin> hes 89 and on a walker
[23:54:32] <sd> 07<s​uttin> I suggested a life alert. I was told he wouldn't wear it. I said thats on him then
[23:54:37] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Homebrew it and see what happens
[23:54:40] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Gl
[23:55:06] *** Quits: nullrend (~nullrend@user/nullrend) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[23:55:08] <shibboleth> not the approach i'd go for, but trying to keep things simple
[23:55:26] <sd> 07<s​uttin> whats more simple than life alert with fall detection?
[23:55:31] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Sounds like the dude needs to be in an assisted living facility
[23:55:38] <shibboleth> there are several ways to do this. lowest-tech i can think of is a vibration sensor on the floor(s) and a thermal sensor/camera. if vibration/fall detected and thermal signature=stationary then alert
[23:55:40] <shibboleth> these thermals sensors can serve a dual purpose as a fire/smoke-alarm
[23:56:06] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> How would that work with sleeping?
[23:56:06] <sd> 07<s​uttin> Also, the end user of this isn't going to be me, its going to be my mother in law
[23:56:30] <shibboleth> bd: well, you won't be jumping on the floor while sleeping, now would you?
[23:57:03] <sd> 07<s​uttin> he basically is in an assisted living now while we work from home. We're only here while we wait for our house to get done being built
[23:57:37] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> I assume he hates it there and wants to be home?
[23:58:37] <sd> 07<s​uttin> I mean hes at his house now. We just happen to be here incase he falls. If he goes into an assisted living place its going to be downhill fast. Hes 89
[23:59:20] <sd> 07<s​uttin> motherfucker still rides the bike for 30 minutes and lifts weights everyday too. He works out more than I do
