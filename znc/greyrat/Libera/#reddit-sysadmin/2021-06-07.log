[20:44:59] <csws> grumplestiltzkin, the vnet isn't peered so it was kinda like a private network that happened to overlap but was unconnected

[20:51:58] <riff-IRC> !?
[20:52:09] <csws> yeah I can see a couple of defunct ones from the ubnt testing
[20:52:38] <aab_> erm mines a 10.0.1.0 network 255.0.0.0 subnet I like the 10 network
[20:52:41] <riff-IRC> you need to have routers capable of VLAN tagging if you wanna run VLANs, right?
[20:52:48] <aab_> what / is that again I forgot
[20:53:04] <csws> nah layer 2 managed switch can tag ports
[20:53:05] <nobyk> riff-IRC uh yeah
[20:53:22] <csws> but you need a layer 3 router if you want them to get out of that little network
[20:53:34] <riff-IRC> yea don't got those.
[20:53:38] <nobyk> csws how can you route between VLANs without being able to VLAN, even if the switch supports it
[20:54:02] <csws> well you can't without having a router attached to that VLAN
[20:54:08] <nobyk> ^
[20:54:10] <csws> I use virtual VLAN interfaces on OPNsense and a trunk
[20:54:16] <csws> but I do have one network that doesn't actually have a gateway
[20:54:19] <nobyk> Maybe if router has multiple interfaces
[20:54:24] <csws> CCTV network, the box has 2 NICs and one is plugged into the CCTV VLAN, the other LAN
[20:54:27] <nobyk> and the switch supports it

[20:56:18] <aab_> lol
[20:56:44] <csws> Interfaces -> Other Types -> VLAN
[20:56:54] <csws> you can create interfaces on there tagged to a VLAN
[20:57:00] <csws> then just make sure the parent interface is a trunk and you're all good
[20:57:18] <riff-IRC> trunk as in a physical LAN connection?
[20:57:22] <aab_> 192.168.1.1 /32
[20:57:24] <csws> it's the port configuration
[20:57:30] * riff-IRC nods
[20:58:09] <riff-IRC> dual NIC right now, WAN and LAN1, will be adding a 2nd NIC later so I can have a "quarantined" LAN for toying around with
[20:58:32] <csws> so riff-IRC a network with no VLANs is basically "VLAN 1", on a managed switch you can set a port as an "access" port which means the switch tags it with no input from the client
[20:58:35] *** Joins: Gorian (~default@134.134.137.89)
[20:58:43] <riff-IRC> basically the LAN where all the possibly infected crap goes
[20:58:51] * riff-IRC nods
[20:58:51] <csws> but in this case you'd make it a trunk
[20:58:59] <riff-IRC> don't think I've any L2 managed switches
[20:59:14] <csws> so untagged traffic is sent VLAN 1 still, but the OS can tag packets itself so that traffic goes out on a given VLAN
[20:59:57] <csws> but yeah VLANing makes that whole concept of new networks way more scalable
[21:00:09] <csws> since you can keep your actual physical config the same but start creating new isolated networks
[21:00:38] <riff-IRC> yep
[21:00:54] <riff-IRC> but I'd need to rearc the whole network to make that happen
[21:00:58] <csws> do you have ESXi?
[21:01:02] <riff-IRC> nope
[21:01:06] <csws> reeeeee
[21:01:25] <riff-IRC> not to mention that funds are tight
[21:02:03] <csws> well esxi supports all this crap so you can create virtual switches that exist on specific VLANs and whatnot
[21:02:10] <riff-IRC> ooo
[21:02:46] <riff-IRC> so you can do VLAN tagging on OPNsense, then in ESXi, you can create virtual L2 managed switches that respond accordingly?
[21:02:55] <csws> ummm
[21:02:56] <csws> wellll
[21:03:06] <csws> you need physical hardware to handle that L2 stuff
[21:03:29] <csws> but like you can create a port group on the vswitch that is specific to say "VLAN 10" or whatever
[21:03:30] <riff-IRC> such as NICs and cabling?
[21:03:33] <csws> like I do that with the DMZ
[21:03:40] * riff-IRC nods
[21:04:07] <csws> yeah you'd need your esxi box on a port that's configured as a trunk, then the VLANs need to be configured in the switch's VLAN table so it's aware of them
[21:04:30] <riff-IRC> nice
[21:04:55] <riff-IRC> then you could have physical NICs on the ESXi box and you could trunk from that?
[21:05:37] <csws> yeah well it's just ethernet and then the switchport is configured as a trunk
[21:05:44] * riff-IRC nods
[21:05:49] <csws> so like on cisco it's "switchport mode trunk" on the port
[21:06:04] <csws> switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
[21:06:06] <csws> according to my config
[21:06:24] <riff-IRC> so with OPNsense and ESXi, you could have yourself a REALLY roundabout way for an L2 managed switch?
[21:06:41] <csws> it'd only exist within the vswitch on esxi
[21:06:51] <csws> if you want to plug real hardware into that, you'd need a real switch
[21:06:55] <csws> that can do VLANs and shit
[21:07:07] <riff-IRC> can you route from the vswitch to a physical NIC?
[21:07:41] <csws> vswitches usually have physical adapters associated
[21:07:54] <csws> they don't have to tho.. but that's the config if you want packets to get out
[21:08:15] * riff-IRC nods
[21:08:21] <csws> vswitch with no adapter is like "host-only" on vmware workstation

[23:28:00] <riff-IRC> like alt+shift+r
[23:28:02] <haljhon> well that's a little harder because the node that runs logic is the node that I'm terminating.
[23:28:15] <haljhon> I'd have to run it as like a Lambda or something
[23:28:33] <haljhon> I suppose a node could probably self-terminate...
