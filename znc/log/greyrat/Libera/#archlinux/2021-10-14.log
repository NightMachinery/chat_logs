[00:41:50] <af> th0rne: how do you disable display port?
[00:41:55] <th0rne> I didn't.
[00:42:04] <af> :|
[00:42:05] <th0rne> In fact, I didn't even reboot when this happened.
[00:42:22] <th0rne> I went to sleep one day and it was fine, and now it's persistently disabled across reboots.
[00:42:24] <af> how do you know it is disabled?
[00:42:27] <af> oh
[00:42:35] <bea> disabled in what way?
[00:42:35] <Oddmonger> cpu_stats is too generic, i've found many occurences from various projects
[00:42:38] <af> maybe the hardware is frid
[00:42:38] <th0rne> Well, in xrandr for instance.
[00:42:40] <af> fried
[00:42:54] <th0rne> I mean maybe, but seems like a weird coincidence.
[00:43:00] <th0rne> Like, the same gpu works with hdmi.
[00:43:02] <af> the display port port is pretty sticky
[00:43:09] <th0rne> There are two display ports.
[00:43:12] <af> stuffy, even
[00:43:17] <th0rne> On this card - neither works.
[00:43:27] <Oddmonger> but in the journalctl logs for root, i have found: CROND[269874]: (root) CMD (/usr/local/rtm/bin/rtm 40 > /dev/null 2> /dev/null)

[02:54:16] <raster> you don't learn if you don't actually do the challenge... and to me this challenge smells like "write some code" challenge - thus the packages and tools are those relevant ones which is about as far as arch is concerned. how you use them is "beating the challenge" and learning something in the process :)
[02:54:36] <jtgd> Elony: you are using archlinux but your question is for linux, not specifically arch. ##programming or #crypto might help more

[10:39:08] <lotation> Hi guys, it's the first time using IRC so please, be gentle
[10:39:13] <lotation> Hi, sorry if it isn't much related with Arch but I don't know where to ask.
[10:39:13] <lotation> I need help understanding how libalpm works and how it's used in pacman. 
[10:39:13] <lotation> Let me explain: I've finished recently a basic C programming class and wanted to do something practical so I'm trying to write a really simple program that prints (to terminal) the number of installed packages and how many of these are upgradables. I'm using the pacman source code (obv) and this beautiful site (https://code.toofishes.net/pacman/doc/index.html) as reference but I've a hard time understanding what's going on in the code (e.g. why is 
[10:39:13] <lotation> *function name* called? do I need it for my program?). 
[10:39:15] <lotation> With that being said I wanted to say that I know what I see (linked list, pointers, etc...) but can't understand the big picture.

[10:44:24] <phrik> Title: Pacman Home Page (at archlinux.org)
[10:44:45] <The-Compiler> lotation: I suppose you'd need to dig into pacman or some other project using libalpm if you want examples
[10:44:55] <The-Compiler> lotation: I also found  https://gitlab.archlinux.org/pacman/alpm.rs/-/tree/master/alpm/examples which has some examples for the rust wrapper
[10:44:57] <phrik> Title: alpm/examples · master · Pacman / alpm.rs · GitLab (at gitlab.archlinux.org)
[10:46:40] <lotation> Unfortunately I don't know rust (neither cpp), my programming knowledge is pretty limited to basic shell scripting, C programming and a beginner course to OOP with Java
[10:46:41] *** Quits: caveman (~caveman@gateway/tor-sasl/caveman) (Remote host closed the connection)
[10:47:12] <The-Compiler> lotation: yeah, but if the rust wrapper is a rather thin wrapper, you might get an idea of how to use the C API by looking at Rust examples

[10:48:27] <baltazar> the doxygen docs are packaged as man pages, see libalpm(3). but I guess it's as good as reading the headers, as all the comments are right next to the declarations

[12:38:57] <frojnd> ayekat: yeah thats correct. Private key. Problem is fish shell or ssh-add
[12:39:34] <xst> first you need to add ssh-agent to your shell configuration and than add your keys to it agent.

[17:27:13] <ayekat> ah, ninja'd ^^
[17:27:18] <mpan> Unfortunately sometimes printing spaces is not producing the background. Dunno why TBH.
[17:28:38] <mpan> In case you ask: `tput` produces an escape sequence to tell the terminal to do something “special”. The `setab` is “something special” that sets background color. 15 is the color code for bright white.

[18:17:16] <alexeyan> Lol. So I have a funny bug in chromium. I have 5 windows in total and one of these does not accept keyboard input for the GUI. So no CTRL-W, CTRL-T or entering domains. I can still operate it with the mouse though. And this issues persists on exactly this one session across reboots/restarts. 
[18:17:42] <susi> I thought it might return if urxvtc fails, even with exec, and $? be usable in the original shell
[18:17:43] <tirnanog> susi: if that's all, you can retain exec for the second invocation but not the first.

[18:20:30] <tirnanog> do you want to replace the shell? if the answer is no, don't use exec.

[18:23:44] <tirnanog> also, the urxvtd-followed-by-urxvtc code looks racy. is the daemon guaranteed to be ready by the time urxvtc executes? I don't know enough about urxvt to suggest anything in particular, though.
[18:24:59] <susi> I execute i3-sensible-terminal by pressind mod+enter

[18:28:08] <tirnanog> normally, the shell forks before exec'ing a given program. by using the exec builtin, you're stopping it from forking, basically. quite literally, one program is replaced by the other.
[18:28:42] <tirnanog> there is no parent/child relationship in that case.
[18:29:10] <tirnanog> if it's still not clear, maybe take it to #bash.

[18:46:05] <tirnanog> it's normally used in wrapper code because there's no need to keep a shell hanging around as the parent for the lifetime of the child.
[18:46:27] <tirnanog> but in this case, it's not an option. you have to reap the child to know whether it exited 2.
