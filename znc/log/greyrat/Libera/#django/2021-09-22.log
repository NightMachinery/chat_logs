[00:55:28] <tga> greetings. many times I have to get a queryset and build a dict to map all items by pk, so I can access them later, so I was just making a helper. does something like that already exist?
[00:55:56] <PaulWay[w]> What are you trying to do?
[00:56:45] <tga> in this instance I get a list of ids and need to hydrate them to full model objects
[00:57:00] <PaulWay[w]> Why not get the full models in the queryset?
[00:57:16] <tga> because I need to keep the order
[00:57:25] <PaulWay[w]> queryset.order_by() ?
[00:57:32] <tga> order by what though
[00:57:38] <tga> I have a list of ids, I need to turn them into objects
[00:57:41] <PaulWay[w]> That's the question you must answer.
[00:58:03] <PaulWay[w]> Model.objects.filter(id__in=my_list_of_ids) ?
[00:58:14] <tga> right, that's my first step, but it won't keep the order
[00:58:23] <PaulWay[w]> Model.objects.filter(id__in=my_list_of_ids).order_by() ?
[00:58:33] <tga> right, there is nothing to order by
[00:58:39] <tga> the order is given by my list of ids
[00:58:50] <PaulWay[w]> Then I don't know how you can say "I need to keep the order" if you don't know what you're ordering by.
[00:58:52] <tga> so as a second step, I need to search each id in the queryset and replace it with the object
[00:59:02] <PaulWay[w]> How are the IDs ordered?
[00:59:07] <tga> randomly
[00:59:13] <PaulWay[w]> Because?
[00:59:18] <tga> yes
[00:59:27] <PaulWay[w]> You want a random selection of objects?
[01:00:02] <tga> no, I am trying to replace ids with the corresponding full object in a queryset
[01:00:30] <tga> atm I'm doing it in three steps: query, map by id, replace ids with the corresponding object
[01:00:34] <PaulWay[w]> Start with the part where you need the objects in a random order.
[01:00:36] <PaulWay[w]> Why?
[01:00:53] <PaulWay[w]> Is it actually random?
[01:00:53] <tga> user input
[01:01:01] <tga> it's not ordered_by anything
[01:01:08] <PaulWay[w]> So the user selects a list of items that they want in order?
[01:01:37] <PaulWay[w]> Like 1. milk, 2. eggs, 3. bread, that kind of thing?
[01:01:51] <tga> right, and I persist that as a list of ids
[01:01:59] <PaulWay[w]> Where's that list stored?
[01:02:07] <PaulWay[w]> Does it have any existence in a model?
[01:02:40] <tga> the individual options are model instances, I get their ids in a json document
[01:03:01] <PaulWay[w]> So you don't store this in a model at all.
[01:03:40] <tga> I'll possibly have the json in a text field, but that's not relevant
[01:04:37] <tga> generic question: is there a standard way of getting a queryset as a dict, indexed by a field?
[01:04:57] <tga> more specific question: is there a direct way of hydrating a list of pks from a queryset?
[01:05:19] *** Joins: rannnn8888 (~rannnn888@bzq-79-181-153-142.red.bezeqint.net)
[01:06:29] <PaulWay[w]> If it was a model, of course, you could order by that related field.
[01:06:58] <rannnn8888> Hei help django site cpu use its normal ? when i open the site ? i the only trafic here https://ibb.co/9hxKqBZ
[01:07:03] <rannnn8888> Hey*
[01:07:33] <PaulWay[w]> tga: I mean, it's not difficult to make the dict with a dict comprehension on the queryset.
[01:07:53] <PaulWay[w]> order_dict = {item.key: item for item in queryset}
[01:08:07] <PaulWay[w]> But that's not an ordering.
[01:08:31] <PaulWay[w]> You'd then use a list comprehension to build the order list, of course.
[01:08:42] <tga> right, I find myself doing this a lot
[01:09:11] <PaulWay[w]> Well, most Django uses rely on properties that are already in the database for their ordering.
[01:09:19] <PaulWay[w]> I'm happy to be corrected here.
[01:09:29] <PaulWay[w]> But yeah, make yourself a helper function if you do this a lot.
[01:09:50] <rannnn8888> PaulWay maybe you know what i need cheack ?
[01:10:09] <PaulWay[w]> rannnn8888: I have no idea what your problem is from your description.
[01:10:17] <PaulWay[w]> Your CPU use is normal, when you use the site?
[01:10:40] <tga> rannnn8888: how are you even running your django app? mod_wsgi?
[01:10:51] <tga> apache is not exactly fashionable anymore
[01:11:19] <PaulWay[w]> Who cares about fashion, it works.
[01:11:38] <rannnn8888> PaulWay its ok www-data have two prosses each one 40% +- ? how the server need work like this ?
[01:11:50] <PaulWay[w]> You'd have to look into the Apache logs.
[01:12:09] <tga> supposedly slower than something like gunicorn+nginx
[01:12:09] <rannnn8888> tga yes with mod_wsgi

[19:50:06] <rolandcrosby> those descriptor methods. I don't know enough about the internals of Django models to know whether this is a bad idea or not -- are there places where the model class (or the custom field class, akin to `HandField`) tries to manipulate the attribute directly and so would run into trouble if I used descriptors this way?

[23:48:56] <stdout> it doesn't need to sync. server 2 is constantly watching a dir for new files then it does its thing
[23:49:52] <dodo> i'd be tempted to rsync or scp from cron, doesn't get simpler
[23:50:06] <stdout> another idea would be to have django save the file in db and write something on the server to poll the db and pull the file and place it in the proper dir.

[23:54:05] <gravyconductor> Hello all :wave: My org is currently using Django and celery (4.4.7) with Redis and, well, it hasn't been a great experience so far. Some tasks seem to disappear. I know folks must be using celery+[some broker] at scale in their systems. So thought I'd check here what kind of setups folks are using and the reliability of those setups. Can anyone
[23:54:06] <gravyconductor> talk about the brokers they are using?

[23:55:10] <dodo> rabbitmq works fine for us. fwiw, make sure you have proper logging, for the app and the os level
[23:55:31] <dodo> if tasks disappear and you don't know why it doesn't have to be your broker
[23:57:35] <gravyconductor> This is true. But even with `CELERY_ACKS_LATE` set for tasks, I wouldn't expect to see tasks disappear and never run
[23:58:41] <gravyconductor> What we're looking for is better guarantees about a task completing (whether from failure and being send to DLQ or success)

[23:59:51] <gravyconductor> It seems to be the master celery worker's job (for a group of workers) to manage thinks like the ACKS late and put work back on the queue
