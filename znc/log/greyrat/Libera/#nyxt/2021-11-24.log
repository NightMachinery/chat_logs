[00:31:18] <mariari> weird that bug hits me again
[00:31:24] <mariari> when I respond to comments on github it double posts it
[00:31:39] <mariari> I've noticed this with free leech tokens on private music trackers where nyxt would eat 2 at once
[00:31:50] <mariari> meaning I just don't use it for those tasks
[00:33:35] <mariari> seems I've deleted one comment and now they are both gone... how annoying
[00:34:24] <mariari> (yeah reloading the page fixed the bug... weird)

[08:42:18] <mala> what is the difference between define-command and define-command-global?
[08:52:17] <aartaka> mala: `define-command` defines it in the cureebt package/mode, while `define-command-global` defines it in `nyxt` package. `execute-command` only lists commands that are either in the `nyxt` package of in the packages of the currently enabled modes.
[08:53:05] <aartaka> mala: In the config file, what you want most of the time is `define-command-global`, as it makes the command accessible at any moment.
[08:53:26] <mala> gotcha thanks!
[08:54:00] <aartaka> mala: If you're writing a new mode, though, these two can let you fine-grain what you expose unconditionally and what â€” only when the mode is enabled.
[08:54:14] <aartaka> mala: Glad to help :)
[09:07:18] <edgarvincent[m]> Happy celeriac Wednesday, everyone!

[15:34:58] <Kabouik> Interesting, I did again, breaking Nyxt accidentally so that it shows two buffers at the same time in a split view. :<

[18:32:22] <mariari> I've had that happen on me Kabouik
[18:32:28] <mariari> I've gotten that when I've killed a buffer too fast
[18:32:36] <mariari> and it's not sure how to redraw the screen

[18:44:54] <Kabouik> I think in my case it was when killing the minibuffer a million times in a row (I mistakenly left my D key pressed down, which invoked *many* minibuffers asking me which buffer to delete)
[18:45:19] <mariari> yeah that could also do it!
[18:45:22] <Kabouik> So I just pressed Escape down for about as long, and this happened. I wouldn't be on that procedure to reproduce it though
[18:45:40] <mariari> yeah it's a bit finnicky and requires timing
[18:45:57] <mariari> btw does pasting into the minibuffer delete all previous text for you as well}
[18:46:17] <mariari> my own bug covered up the actual bug in nyxt so I've never reported it
[18:46:43] <Kabouik> Yup, which is annoying as I have a search engine configured for parcel tracking numbers, which I usually have in my clipboard and don't want to type manually
[18:47:03] <mariari> Kabouik: oh yeah I have a custom search command if you do something often
[18:47:22] <mariari> https://pomf2.lain.la/f/wjhytr6x.png this search thing searches 1 particular site so I don't have to give ddg ! commands
[18:47:25] <mariari> have it for a few keys
[18:47:26] <Kabouik> Meaning for my search engine command to work, I have to prefix the tracking number with the search-engine magical word, but pasting the number will overwrite everything
[18:47:52] <mariari> ideally I could make it multi-map with different sites to search for, but my thing is very basic
[19:11:43] <Kabouik> Yup I have set up something similar mariari: https://git.teknik.io/matf/nyxt/src/branch/master/.config/nyxt/base/urlprompt.lisp
[19:12:25] <Kabouik> Well, I ripped it off someone else's configuration and just changed the engines
[19:13:45] <mariari> that's cute I should add search engines and make a command
[19:13:53] <mariari> though mine is a specality command, for 1 site and bound to a key
[19:14:31] <Kabouik> Ah, yeah mine are not bound, I just press O followed by the engine abbreviation I want and then the search term
[19:15:02] <mariari> I might try a similar strategy for multiple selection
[19:15:11] <mariari> though it'd be cooler to have a default selection that gets saved and loaded
[19:15:14] <Kabouik> But obviously for 17track, which is a parcel tracking software, the fact that pasting the clipboard erases the text field is inconvenient. I have to paste the tracking number, then hold Left to go back to the beginning (Home doesn't work) and add 17t
[19:15:16] <mariari> and can change with a single C-key

[22:05:56] <emacs-dwim> I'm searching through source to find the reason that when I press "l" it gives Backspace in input prompts. The X keycode is set be "l", but with ISO3_Shift it is Backspace. Other keys with ISO3_Shift variants work correctly.

[22:07:34] <emacs-dwim> describe-key reports it as Unbound: "l" [#33]
[22:09:49] <emacs-dwim> s-l allows me to type l though.
[22:10:16] <emacs-dwim> l
[22:11:17] <emacs-dwim> that's super. i think nyxt calls that S- rather than s-
[22:43:23] <jmercouris> Thatâ€™s correct
[22:43:44] <jmercouris> S is for super and s is for shift
