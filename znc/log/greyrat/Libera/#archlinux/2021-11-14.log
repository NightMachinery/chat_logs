[02:21:00] <jbm> node1, UEFI can be used without "secure-boot" enabled.. A lot of users do not use secure-boot(UEFI) because it is a pita to setup.
[02:21:45] <node1> Yes, but if you want to make an agreement with hardware vendor and software  or to make trust of your program then you must uses UEFI way
[02:21:48] <node1> I believe.
[02:21:59] <jbm> node1, ? that made no sense
[02:23:05] <jbm> node1, UEFI is just a newer to provide a kick-up start for operating systems... it's nothing special other than having a large focus for "LARGE DISK SUPPORT" :)  --- """" GPT  """  ---- DOSMBR partition tables are limitted to 2.2 Terabytes..

[04:19:40] <tyzoid> markofcorn: Another option, if you've already applied patches / etc to the extracted source, is to specify the -e flag to makepkg

[04:20:33] <markon101>  If anyone is having issues with BSPWM and GDM try disabling Wayland in GDM config. That fixed the issue I was having of logging in to BSPWM. This fix may work for i3 etc.

[05:13:56] <tyzoid> took 8MB of ram to run weechat, as opposed to 600MB+ in a browser
[05:14:08] <juliademille> yeah English is my first language lol
[05:14:08] <jbm> juliademille, "bouncers" ("security" people who throw out drunk people at a bar :)
[05:14:09] <tyzoid> Which was significant on a machine with only 4GB of RAM available
[05:14:23] <susi> 8MB to run weechat :o
[05:14:35] * interweb tests
[05:14:43] <rcf> With the SUPERIOR WEECHAT CLIENT I get a client, a bouncer, and even a web interface for my phone, SO SUCK IT IRSSI </blatant trolling> 
[05:14:43] <juliademille> i know what a bouncer is outside of IRC context

[09:35:53] <Satin> what's the best arch based distro with stuff out of the box that isn't arch itself? i have a laptop with an RTX 2060 card and i'd like things to work out of the box as much as possible
[09:36:06] <Satin> but I also don't like Manjaro messing/adding things ontop of arch
[09:36:09] <Satin> AUR*
[09:36:17] <espero> then use Arch 
[09:36:22] <Satin> like the way they fiddle with the AUR handler
[09:36:32] <espero> maybe look for an installer that will install everything for you 
[09:37:24] <Satin> well is it wrong to ask for distro reccomendations that meet a certain criteria in here? mainly for me: a) decent out of the box support for hardware b) not messing with arch things like the AUR handler much at the same time

[10:57:09] <jbm> jbox, apparently there's something better than \\.\PhysicalDrive** --- but I am not sure if vbox supports it via its vdmk configuration files --- in a way it can be have more uniquely as Linux's  /dev/disk/by-id  paths...
[10:58:02] <jbm> jbox, I am very interested to know if that makes it better -- who knows I might be in a situation the same to perform a V2P setup and transfer..
[10:58:24] <jbm> (virtual-to-physical prep setup)
[10:58:40] <jbox> ah I see
[10:59:26] <jbox> I'm popping down a tall stack of tangents I've gotten myself into so I may be a bit before I get the chance to fix it
[11:01:18] <jbm> jbox, but did you understand the text I sent on the channel yesterday? -- \\{Volume*} -- is not the path expression to use for physical devices..
[11:01:44] <jbox> jbm: no, I'm not sure. Could you explain it again please?
[11:01:49] <jbm> jbox, (dismissing any other application than vbox itself)
[11:02:34] <jbm> jbox, Vbox is likely using an "offset" when you're using  \\{Volume instead of \\.\PhysicalDrive*

[11:04:08] <jbm> jbox, the problem with \\.\Physical* is it can change on the host reboot -- so that's why the alternative interface-path was something I suggested you can look into-- and you can determine if it is really unique..
[11:04:23] <jbm> jbox, \\.\Physical* looks like it can remap on a reboot.. so it's not safe to use..
[11:04:51] <jbox> oops, maybe that's what I did wrong

[11:08:24] <jbm> jbox, \\{Volume*} doesn't...  --- but the stupid utilities are using the \\{Volume*} to hint to them what "physical" device you're using --- this is different on Vbox IIRc...
[11:08:49] <jbm> jbox, that's another way to access the same disk but with a unique string value. it makes it less dangerous if it is truly unique on the system.
[11:09:33] <jbm> jbox, because the problem of \\Physical** (i'm repeating myself) is that it can remap ---- similar problems you have is /dev/sda with root= in GRUB, instead we use UUID= -- same idea...

[11:10:21] <jbox> that is the error I keep getting when I mount my efi partition

[11:20:02] <jbm> jbox, what's the name of the custom information file for physical disks? it's .v__ ?
[11:20:09] <jbox> I'd prefer to fix it in virtualbox if possible because going in raw is less convenient for obvious reasons. Plus, I'd have to download an irc client on my phone and I cba unless there's no other way

[11:22:49] <jbm> jbox, the way you can test that is by seeing if there is a newly created partition table elsewhere... the thing is GPT is beyond the simpler partitoin table than just DOSMBR .
[11:23:12] <jbm> DOSMBR is one sector, but GPT covers more sectors for its partition table -- making it more complicating.

[11:43:40] <jbm> jbox, thing is i'm not sure if it it'll work becaues you'll want to set the disk to "offline" ... not sure if the interface-path is available once the disk is set offline
[11:44:36] <jbm> jbox, all of this uncertainty goes away if you can have a usb-enclosure for the nvme(if possible) -- that way you just set the lock on the VM-guest... and not worry about anything like a double-mount

[12:16:33] <jbox> hmmm jbm I forgot to mention something
[12:16:39] <jbox> I think I know where I screwed it up
[12:17:05] <karrq> hello... I've been struggling a bit and I'm trying to setup something honestly contrived... basically I have an SDD with windows and I wanted to run linux alongside it, but I wanted windows to have it's own ESP so it wouldn't mess up my bootloader in case of an update, but at the same time I wanted linux to be able to boot into windows via the bootloader configuration
[12:18:18] <alloy> karrq after doing Linux for decades I've given up on that and just use 2 drives (on my gaming desktop where I do use windows sometimes)  -  not an answer I know just some wisdom :)
[12:18:32] <Tom^> karrq: grub can boot other bootloaders from seperate partitions.

[12:19:29] <Tom^> so technically just create a second ESP and root / , place linux on that. point your efi to it. setup an entry in grub that points to windows ESP. as long as your motherboard doesnt contain a broken implentation it will work

[12:19:46] <karrq> alloy, that's not an option for me unfortunately... I'll be primarily using windows in a vm actually, that's why I wanted it's own ESP too so that ther's no accidental "boot into linux again" from the VM
[12:19:49] <jbox> I was trying to boot in EFI mode, and when you boot in EFI mode in virtualbox it drops you into an EFI shell, where I had to select the efi file manually, like on this post: https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?t=45065 I then tried to write a startup.nsh file to the ESP, which is when I got my first I/O write error. I think that's what fucked it up

[12:20:35] <karrq> Tom^ I'm not gonna use grub, because my linux setup is also not very straightfoward (I'll fix that when the time comes) so I wanted to use refind with manual boot stanzas
[12:21:01] <Tom^> karrq: yeah well no idea about refind. grub handles with it.
[12:21:29] <Tom^> karrq: besides grub is just as manual as any other boot loaders, grub-mkconfig isnt necessery
[12:22:27] <jbm> jbox, the boot is irrelevant if you can't mount your filesystem from a rescue boot
[12:22:27] <karrq> refind can also handle that, no problem actually. but since refind is living in another ESP than the microsoft's I'm struggling a bit. I'm not even sure how you'd do that in grub
[12:22:30] <jbox> alloy: I'm currently trying to get a similar setup to work. I have windows on one drive, linux on another, and I'm trying to boot my linux install as a guest in virualbox running on my windows host, so I don't have to reboot the computer every time i want to use linux again lol
[12:23:15] <jbm> jbox, are you picking up the meaning of "filesystem" is separate from boot data?  boot data is not important on a disk, if you can't mount any filesystems from that disk..
[12:23:38] <jbm> jbox, the boot-process is a bit intermingle and confusing -- but completely forget anything about "bootable".
[12:23:46] <jbm> jbox, it's not important
[12:23:53] <jbm> jbox, maybe your data is 100% still intact...
[12:24:12] <jbox> jbm: I should also mention that I successfully booted into and used my physical linux install through the \\.\PhysicalDrive2 vmdk, multiple times. I only screwed it up when I tried to write that startup.nsh file

[12:24:21] <Tom^> meh i meant /
[12:24:25] <jbm> jbox, just that you have a particular offset somewhere for a properly working superblock
[12:24:28] <Tom^> trying to find that effing example :p
[12:24:54] <jbox> jbm: my data is intact. I can ls the ESP no problem. I just can't write to it and i get those errors every time I mount
[12:25:01] <jbm> jbox, thta's not important if you know how to write a file to a fat filesystem
[12:25:51] <jbm> jbox, was the disk always listing as GPT, or did it ever at one point say DOSMBR?
[12:25:52] <jbox> jbm: I used virtualbox's EFI shell to write it though, which might have messed up part of the superblock or something. I think it would have been fine if I wrote it from my arch install when I could boot it
[12:26:03] <jbox> GPT always jbm
[12:26:09] <jbm> jbox, you weren't supposed to write anything at all.

[12:37:55] <jbox> Windows Hardware Quality Labs. I'm not sure why, but re-enabling that (I had it off after trying a million bios settings) fixed a problem I was having where my windows bootloader wasn't showing up

[12:39:42] <karrq> but also the second issue I was having, that made me want to try refind, is my linux system... I simply wasn't able to boot.

[13:07:04] <jbm> jbox, storage works like a ruler -- [  ]   everything cannot criss-cross
[13:07:22] <jbm> jbox, that's why it is called LBA logical block storage --- "Logical Block Addressing"

[13:08:40] <jbox> ah right
[13:08:41] <gabbiel> jbm: didn't even know partuuid was different, maybe that's why my boot wasn't working
[13:08:56] <jbm> gabbiel, PARTUUID is the partition id -- as from the partitoin table.
[13:09:21] <jbm> gabbiel, the UUID is sometimes labelled as the "fsuuid" with other utilities --- "filesystem uuids" are embedded in the superblock of the filesystem.
[13:10:12] <jbm> gabbiel, if you make an EXT2 filesystem... and check its uuid with file -s or lsblk, and then redo mkfs.ext2 on the same partition.. the UUID(or called the fsuuid) will be different. 
[13:10:19] <jbm> ^ the PARTUUID will always be the same.
[13:10:22] <gabbiel> lmao i was using fsuuid, and all i had to do was put "2" instead
[13:10:28] <karrq> I also found out last time I set this laptop up that PARTUUID is not the same as UUID, because I copied over the wrong one and I noticed the "format" looked different
[13:10:28] <jbm> ^^ unless you touch the partition table itself..
[13:10:33] <jbm> gabbiel, ^
[13:11:15] <jbm> if you change the PARTUUID, it doesn't change the filesystem UUID
[13:12:15] <karrq> booooooooom I'm iiin!!
[13:12:19] <gabbiel> niceee
[13:12:33] <jbm> it's confusing because it's more than an unnecesary option ---  the 3rd option is to use LABEL=  - - provided you gave your superblock a label name (tune2fs can be used to add a label)
[13:12:39] <karrq> so what I did was change grub to use the "legacy" stuff, so no partuuid but nice readable /dev/mapper/cryptbtrfs
[13:12:53] <karrq> and also pass cryptdevice=/dev/nvme0n1p8:cryptbtrfs to my kernel

[17:03:41] <SysGhost> jirido: the general way to do that is: stop any SystemD services responsible for sound. Unload kernel modules for the hardware involved. reload said kernel modules, restart SystemD services.
[17:03:58] <SysGhost> jirido: but that often require killing/stopping the graphical environment as well.
[17:04:13] <SysGhost> so... a full reboot is often the much easier way out.

[23:02:56] <ayekat> ok, that looks fine
[23:03:03] <osokin> Ah okei..
[23:03:15] <ayekat> no, /home is owned by root
[23:03:46] <ayekat> as mentioned above, /home/osokin is your home directory - but there may be other home directories in there, so it wouldn't make sense if it was owned by one particular user :-)
[23:04:02] <ayekat> osokin: what's the output of `command -v xfce4`?
[23:04:20] <osokin> Cool, thanks for clarifying
[23:05:00] <ayekat> actually, it looks to me that `xfce4` is probably not a valid command there - at least I don't see any such file in the package file database
[23:05:08] <osokin> Nothing prompted
[23:05:29] <ayekat> osokin: so yeah, that's the wrong command to run - see https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xfce#Starting

[23:06:22] <ayekat> osokin: but overall, also have a look at https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xinit#xinitrc - because a single-line "exec $mywm" xinitrc isn't sufficient, and you're missing some parts there
