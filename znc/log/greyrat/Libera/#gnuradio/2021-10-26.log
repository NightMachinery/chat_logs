[00:14:50] <JoshMorman[m]> hey nickoe 
[00:15:12] <JoshMorman[m]> some of them are documented, but not all
[00:15:21] <JoshMorman[m]> which label are you wondering about
[00:20:09] <nickoe> Backport-3.9 and Backport-3.8
[00:20:28] <nickoe> does it mean they are candidates to be backported, does it mean it should be backported or does it mean it has been backported?

[00:31:14] <Hash[m]> If anyone has used a BladeRF 2 Micro with GNURadio to transmit successfully I’d like to chat with you, can’t seem to figure out why all I ever get is what looks like solid energy transmitted at the frequency I set, USRP B200 as a sink in the same flowgraph works no problem
[00:35:58] <DerekKozel[m]> nickoe I believe those are labels for PRs that are going to be backported.
[00:37:09] <JoshMorman[m]> Yes, these are flags to indicate that they should be backported, not that they have or necessarily will - mainly so that we don't forget to do it if it is deemed necessary

[01:33:08] <flash[m]> Captain Obvious says you don't have NumPy installed/configured
[01:34:30] <mcdiarmid[m]> Definitely installed, but what do you mean by "configured"?
[01:35:19] <mcdiarmid[m]> maybe it's using a different python3 than the one I expect
[01:36:40] <flash[m]> CMake does a lot of magic to determine where things are installed. If your NumPy is installed somewhere other than where it expects, you might have to help it out
[01:37:35] <flash[m]> in your build directory, CMakeCache.txt is a useful file to poke around in. One that looks interesting to me is "_Python3_INTERPRETER_PROPERTIES"
[01:39:02] <flash[m]> another useful value is CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX ... if set, it will search in $CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib/cmake/... for CMake installation files
[01:39:28] <flash[m]> (actually, the normal search path, not just lib ... in my case, it's lib64)
[01:40:56] <flash[m]> "Python::NumPy" is a CMake namespace value. Somewhere is a file that should be defining the Python::NumPy target, but that exhausts my knowledge of how GNU Radio CMake works
[01:41:31] <mcdiarmid[m]> Thank you for all the info, I'll go off that and see where I get
[01:42:17] <Macuser> GL
[01:42:26] <flash[m]> my guess would be to look at cmake/SetupPython.cmake

[15:07:51] <drmpeg> But much more likely, it's an analog loopback. As soon as you go analog, there will be gain differences and noise added. Which is exactly what you're seeing.

[17:57:13] <Reventlov[m]> ( I followed https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/UbuntuInstall )
[18:13:16] <Hash[m]> So I was able to get my BladeRF Micro to transmit but have to feed through a block to multiply by around 0.0004 before the BladeRF. That same signal can be sent directly into a USRP... I've seen similar things with RTL-SDR vs USRP on the receive side. Is it a data type issue that's being compensated for?

[18:14:37] <jholtom> sounds like its expecting some sort of normalization that you aren't doing
[18:14:49] <jholtom> I don't know the bladerf frontend/blocks very well
[18:15:03] <jholtom> and the 0.0004 just happens to be close to the right normalization approach for your signal
[18:17:29] <Hash[m]> Interesting, definitely the multiply block is still a bandaid because I get a ton of energy at the LO freq when using my flowgraph. If I just capture data with the bladerf command line utility and play it back it's perfect
[18:26:17] <muaddib[m]> <Reventlov[m]> "20.04, focal" <- Right, python 3 is the default in 20 Since Python 2 went EOL. Is this a fresh install or an upgrade?
[18:29:04] <Reventlov[m]> upgrade

[19:20:07] <drmpeg> I saw a picture on Twitter of a bladeRF spectrum with a huge DC spike. It says x115, but I believe it's a 2.0 (because the flat-top is so flat). https://twitter.com/abraxas3d/status/1450033908469288962

[19:38:15] <Hash[m]> Yea, same thing I saw, massive spike when I turn on TX, but if I use the bladerf-cli tool I can send a clean transmission with no spike, so definitely something with the way I am sending it data from GNURadio... but annoying they don't seem to address this on their site/wiki... Or if they do, I didn't see it
[19:40:19] <Hash[m]> Also using osmocom sink it doesn't work at all using bladerf=0 for the driver, have to use soapy=0 then it works. I know I'm no expert... but it's no USRP B200 experience for sure :) 
[19:40:19] <drmpeg> I think the AD9361 has a built-in DC offset calibration, so it's weird to see that big spike.
[19:45:10] <drmpeg> I don't see any of the old software guys committing to the repo anymore. I wonder if Nuand is just one guy now.
[19:45:37] <Jacob[m]12> most of the 9361 features must be calibrated correctly and enabled to work, very possible they are not doing that
[19:47:15] <drmpeg> Plus there are a lot less TX users out there than RX users.

[19:50:56] <Hash[m]> I captured 2Msps at 98M for some FM radio then played it back both using their command line tool and it looked fantastic... But getting it to work in GNURadio is a whole other story for me
[19:51:55] <Hash[m]> and if I use that capture file in gnuradio as a source, then convert from IShort to CF32 and multiple by 0.000488 into osmo sink it also looks pretty good
[19:53:01] <Hash[m]> no spike... but using my own flowgraphs into the osmo sink my data is obviously not formatted in a way it likes so I get that crazy DC spike and my bursts around it
[19:55:44] <drmpeg> I would try to get the osmosdr driver to work. That pretty much interfaces to the bladeRF driver directly.
[19:56:02] <drmpeg> Not sure about Soapy.

[20:13:22] <Hash[m]> At this point I just want to solve the TX issue out of sheer determination!
[20:13:36] <Hash[m]> but yea, likely will be primarily used for receive
[20:14:57] <drmpeg> I had a lot of fun with bladeRF 1.0 though. There was a great community on IRC after the KickStarter.
[20:15:45] <Hash[m]> Wow,perhaps it
[20:15:59] <Hash[m]> it's just the gain... setting it to 20 did zip but 80 jams
[20:16:16] <willcode4[m]> I did test the Soapy BladeRF Sink when we put that in. It requires the Soapy BladeRF module to be installed.
[20:18:37] <drmpeg> I also tested the Soapy stuff with bladeRF 1.0 with no problems.
[20:27:20] <Hash[m]> so it looks like my gain was just so low it didn't show up for me, pushed it from 20 to ~50 and I can see my signal now with bladerf=0 driver. Still huge DC spike but will attribute that to the data I am feeding in, perhaps it's all biased in some way leading to that?
[20:30:47] <drmpeg> Transmit 0's and see what happens.
[20:33:06] <muaddib[m]> <drmpeg> "I would try to get the osmosdr..." <- I second this. Having no bladerf experience, I can say that soapy adds an abstraction layer in there. Modularity vs performance as always. 
[20:33:06] <muaddib[m]> However, if i remember right soapy “module” files can be pretty easy to navigate since driver/API abstraction by nature uses the same language (parameters)
[20:35:14] <muaddib[m]> <Hash[m]> "so it looks like my gain was..." <- Is there possibly a flag in the API for dc offset correction? Epiq radios have that in the FPGA image but you have to enable it
[20:35:18] <Hash[m]> drmpeg: null source directly into osmocom sink at full gain (66) produces just the spike

[20:36:07] <muaddib[m]> If there is, that’s we’re the simplicity of soapy could help you out. Might be able to add a hard coded API call
[20:36:12] <Hash[m]> muaddib[m]: They have this and i believe it's used, if I capture data and replay it even in gnuradio using their driver it plays back just fine. Feels like it's something to do with my data
[20:36:34] <drmpeg> That's what I thought. So it's not your TX IQ that's causing it.
[20:37:19] <muaddib[m]> Yea, if a null source is producing a spike it’s not your data.
