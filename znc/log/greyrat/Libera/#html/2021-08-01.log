[15:20:14] <mysteryhunter> hi. i dont know if im right here but i have a question. when i usually post a news on twitter there comes such a picture with the article... like here https://twitter.com/rMysteryhunter/status/1416454773067419649
[15:20:45] <mysteryhunter> but when i post a news of my own website that isnt so https://twitter.com/MysteryNewsTV/status/1421539600435228674
[15:20:52] <mysteryhunter> how can i do that that it shows that?
[15:21:51] <mysteryhunter> is there a html code or something that i must enter in the news site?
[15:24:41] <entuland> it may have something to do with the structure of your markup or the OG meta or something, whatever twitter is "peeking in" to find in the link you are sharing
[15:25:28] <mysteryhunter> so what do i have to do?
[15:25:36] <entuland> I'm trying to find about it
[15:25:43] <mysteryhunter> ok thx
[15:26:03] <entuland> this may or may not be related, it may be a similar result from different premises: https://nealschaffer.com/tweet-link-preview-image-twitter/
[15:26:59] <entuland> as additional pointers, see this article about FB, it should be more or less the same stuff in the end: https://meetedgar.com/blog/facebooks-new-link-previews-need-know-2018/
[15:27:18] <entuland> as you can see that article mentions the OG metas
[15:28:57] <mysteryhunter> ok thx
[15:30:18] <entuland> yw
[16:02:29] <mysteryhunter> die metas kommen in <head bereich oder?
[16:02:30] <mysteryhunter> entuland, 
[16:08:13] <entuland> sorry, I don't speak German
[16:09:26] <entuland> I guess you're asking where you should put the <meta> tags, and yes, they go in the <head> pretty much - these pages are your friends: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta
[16:27:58] <mysteryhunter> ah sry i meant the meta i give in head area right?
[16:28:04] <mysteryhunter> ah yea
[16:28:12] <mysteryhunter> yea i know html for years
[16:28:16] <mysteryhunter> just was unsure
[16:31:00] <mysteryhunter> doesnt work https://twitter.com/rMysteryhunter/status/1421803052470784002
[16:32:18] <mysteryhunter> https://paste.debian.net/hidden/c4e61739/
[16:32:25] <mysteryhunter> the last lines is the meta
[16:39:41] <mysteryhunter> why it not work?
[16:39:53] <mysteryhunter> i wrote it exactly asit standed on the site
[16:43:11] <mysteryhunter> ?
[16:51:01] <mysteryhunter> aaah i think i got the mistake
[16:52:51] <mysteryhunter> no still not working
[16:52:53] <mysteryhunter> OH GOD
[16:53:30] <entuland> please take in account that such systems may be caching the pages and not picking up any changes
[16:54:12] <entuland> I really mean twitter caching the data about how to embed the link to that specific page
[16:54:38] <mysteryhunter> what u mean?
[16:54:43] <mysteryhunter> oh
[16:54:46] <mysteryhunter> damn
[16:54:54] <mysteryhunter> that means its senseless?
[16:55:02] <entuland> you may need to create a new page with the metas you want to test and try linking it in a tweet
[16:55:03] <mysteryhunter> whatever i nchange it wont show it?
[16:55:12] <entuland> so that you are forcing twitter to process a page they never "seen"
[16:55:18] <mysteryhunter> yea but this is my page i dont wanna create a new one
[16:55:18] <entuland> that caching is of course just temporary
[16:55:57] <entuland> but I have no idea how long they'll keep those caches and whether they are honoring any cache headers your own site is providing
[16:56:37] <entuland> https://www.mitostudios.com/blog/how-to-clear-twitter-featured-image-cache/
[16:57:53] <mysteryhunter> how long does it need to cache new?
[16:59:09] <mysteryhunter> Unable to render Card preview
[16:59:36] <mysteryhunter> https://ibb.co/Qpv9prW
[16:59:51] <mysteryhunter> what means no card found
[17:01:12] <mysteryhunter> AH
[17:01:16] <mysteryhunter> I need toe nter this https://ibb.co/Qpv9prW
[17:01:23] <mysteryhunter> i mean this <meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image"/>
[17:02:40] <mysteryhunter> now it works
[17:07:05] <mysteryhunter> https://ibb.co/M1jbYJr <- isnt there a way to put the picturen below the title and article?
[17:07:11] <mysteryhunter> or put a headline above the picture?
