[02:00:13] <wallbroken> that template it's just an account management form

[02:03:40] <hyper_dave> FunkyBob, I need help on deciding model structures. I'm so confused.

[02:15:16] <wallbroken> yes
[02:15:51] <FunkyBob> i'd probably swap Form classes in the view...
[02:16:39] <wallbroken> if not user is_staff:
[02:16:44] <wallbroken>     exclude = ['password',]

[02:17:17] <wallbroken> you can see the code
[02:17:25] <FunkyBob> however , since exclude is part of a declarative style.. that test won't wortk
[02:17:31] <FunkyBob> no, I can't... you haven't given a link to it

[02:18:05] <wallbroken> yes, that one
[02:18:21] <FunkyBob> ok, if you tried what you suggested... it will complain user is not defined
[02:18:49] <wallbroken> mine it just was an high level idea
[02:19:39] <hyper_dave> FunkyBob: Okay. Thanks. So I have a school assignment to build a digital health api platform. So there are different login user types which I tried to handle with model inheritance from a custom user model. The user types are patient, doctor, hospital_operator, pharmacist, pharmacy_operator... And my Idea was to create models for hospitals and pharmacies which inherit from a base class
[02:19:41] <hyper_dave> 'Organization' to share similar content. So here I want to link doctors and hospital operators to hospitals with through m2m relationship, and same for pharmacy types. I couldn't wrap my head around the structure that might work for this use case.
[02:19:58] <hyper_dave> The structure should not necessary be the way it is described above.
[02:20:15] <FunkyBob> hyper_dave: beware of writing novels on IRC
[02:20:32] <FunkyBob> also, beware of model inheritance
[02:20:53] <anorthall> i enjoyed the novel
[02:21:04] <dre> Morning all
[02:21:07] <hyper_dave> I was gonna write it up in pastebin. I did'nt expect it to be this long.
[02:21:13] <FunkyBob> anorthall: engaging story, well written, formatting made it difficult to read, though
[02:21:27] <FunkyBob> morning, dre
[02:21:54] <dre> not enough aliens in novel. not interested. book deal cancelled
[02:21:55] <anorthall> FunkyBob: yep, my thoughts too, i gave it 4.5 on goodreads
[02:22:21] <anorthall> on amazon I gave it 5 stars though, because apparently all books on amazon are 5 stars
[02:22:26] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: you still haven't proposed a solution
[02:22:33] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: yes I have
[02:22:38] <hyper_dave> FunkyBob: here is where it is now. kind of incomplete and messy. http://hastebin.com/ipilelupin.py
[02:22:48] <FunkyBob> 21:02 < FunkyBob> i'd probably swap Form classes in the view...
[02:22:53] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: which one?
[02:22:58] <wallbroken> oh yes
[02:23:06] <wallbroken> but that's an idea of a solution
[02:23:10] <FunkyBob> one can inherit the other so it's not repeating code
[02:23:13] <wallbroken> not the implementation itself
[02:23:22] <FunkyBob> no, the implementation is up to you ... as always
[02:23:37] <wallbroken> you know my limits
[02:24:03] <FunkyBob> and you keep testing mine.
[02:24:37] <wallbroken> so you want me to create two different forms
[02:24:43] <wallbroken> form classes
[02:24:54] <wallbroken> one for admin, and another one for normal users

[02:25:00] <FunkyBob> 21:09 < FunkyBob> one can inherit the other so it's not repeating code
[02:25:53] <GinFuyou> hyper_dave, looking at your users, it's not clear why roles other than doctor and patient require separate models
[02:26:31] <GinFuyou> also as was said, multi-table inheritance is not something you likely want until you are sure
[02:26:47] <FunkyBob> hyper_dave: also, knock off this 'uuid as pk' thing... it will bite you, honest
[02:26:51] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: good idea
[02:27:04] <wallbroken> do you want me to create a parent class?
[02:27:39] <wallbroken> the most important part: how to discriminate between the two classes?
[02:27:41] <hyper_dave> FunkyBob: I can and will get rid off it for this one.
[02:27:49] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: usually by name
[02:28:02] <wallbroken> each class is hadled by an url
[02:28:08] <wallbroken> i should create two different urls

[02:28:29] <FunkyBob> have the view choose the form based on the current user
[02:28:55] <wallbroken> mmm
[02:29:01] <wallbroken> but i'm unable to do that
[02:29:08] <wallbroken> can you teach me to do it?
[02:29:14] <hyper_dave> FunkyBob: I needed those because they are supposed to be consumed by separate portals.
[02:29:31] <FunkyBob> hyper_dave: you can still have uuids... just as a separate unique field
[02:30:14] <hyper_dave> What's the point?
[02:31:00] <FunkyBob> hmm... i should blog about this some day
[02:31:26] <FunkyBob> one thing is i'm still not 100% sure all the corners of django that assume int PKs are cleaned up...
[02:32:02] <FunkyBob> sequential PKs also avoid pathalogical index update behaviors that kill performance
[02:32:13] <FunkyBob> [though the unique index will still have that]
[02:32:32] <FunkyBob> you get guaranteed uniqueness of pks [though, again, the index]

[03:27:41] <FunkyBob> also you just messed up your template_name_suffix declaration by making it part of the method
[03:27:51] <FunkyBob> yes, indenting still matters...
[03:28:51] <wallbroken> https://dpaste.org/nMpQ
[03:29:02] <FunkyBob> holy shit
[03:29:15] <FunkyBob> no
[03:29:53] <FunkyBob> that makes even less sense
[03:30:15] <FunkyBob> especially because (1) this class has no 'formset_class', and (2) that return is outside a method
[03:30:17] <wallbroken> return self.form_class
[03:30:20] <FunkyBob> no
[03:30:22] <FunkyBob> fucking NO
[03:30:26] <FunkyBob> return the class you want
[03:30:43] <FunkyBob> use your brain... and stop wanting things to be complex
[03:31:01] <FunkyBob> that method needs to return the form class you want the view to use
[03:31:18] <FunkyBob> but (a) you are assigning it to a variable... that is then never used
[03:31:25] <FunkyBob> and (b) you don't return anything
[03:31:38] <FunkyBob> how on earth do you get by in your dayjob?
[03:31:39] <wallbroken> and i did that
[03:31:45] <wallbroken> return self.form_class
[03:31:47] <FunkyBob> no you didn't... not in the last paste you gave
[03:31:48] <FunkyBob> no
[03:31:48] <wallbroken> why you said not?
[03:32:00] <FunkyBob> because (1) that's OUTSIDE the method.... so it's an error
[03:32:05] <FunkyBob> and (2) there is no self.formset_class
[03:32:26] <FunkyBob> can you not understand that self.formset_class and formset_class are completely separate things?
[03:32:31] <wallbroken> https://dpaste.org/cyP9
[03:32:42] <FunkyBob> huzzah!
[03:32:59] <wallbroken> i fon't know what the fuck "self" is
[03:33:01] <FunkyBob> you didn't even need the form_class variable... could have just returned directly
[03:33:06] <FunkyBob> self is the class instance
[03:33:14] <FunkyBob> it's like "this" in C++
[03:33:34] <wallbroken> the class instance in which i'm in?
[03:33:44] <FunkyBob> the one the method is being called on
[03:34:44] <wallbroken>  if self.request.user.is_staff():
[03:34:47] <wallbroken> execution error
[03:34:53] <wallbroken> do i need brackets?
[03:35:02] <FunkyBob> read the topic, wallbroken
[03:36:06] <wallbroken> https://dpaste.org/srkd
[03:36:32] <FunkyBob> is_staff is a bool property, not a method
[03:38:40] <FunkyBob> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/contrib/auth/#django.contrib.auth.models.User.is_staff
[03:39:40] <wallbroken> it works
[03:39:46] <wallbroken> thank you, as usual
[03:41:31] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: but shops which implements ecommerce solution uses an out of the box solutions?
[03:41:49] <wallbroken> or they hire developers who write the entire solution?
[03:42:11] <FunkyBob> I would expect most would use an off-the-shelf solution
[03:42:20] <FunkyBob> these days they're quite common and well developed
[03:43:00] <wallbroken> CRM are also ecommerce?
[03:43:09] <FunkyBob> I wouldn't think so
[03:43:28] <FunkyBob> but there could be a lot of overlap between c-commercse (especially b2b), CRM, and ERP
[03:43:40] <FunkyBob> IMHO a good e-commerce system is a front for an ERP... too many work the other way
[03:43:57] <wallbroken> ERP what does specifically is?

[12:45:33] <pycode> basically i have to annotate() one field where i need to put the token of the trade

[12:46:33] <pycode> how can i handle that condition?

[14:10:05] <pycode> shangxiao, and pardon whats wrong with my names? could you give me an example please?
[14:12:23] <pycode> shangxiao, no it is not 1-1 because many trades could happen on the same PRICE.....but....but....using different strategy (strategy is a field on Trade model)
[14:15:32] <pycode> shangxiao, my price hold 1 minute candle with open high low close
[14:16:50] <pycode> so a price has many trades
[14:25:38] <schinckel> Using field names that are single character means you need to remember what `op` means in that context: is it Opening Price or Operation?
[14:25:51] <schinckel> If you use `operation` as the field name, it's like it comments your code for you.
[14:30:41] <pycode> ah ok ok yes for that field yes...i thought foe entry_price and exit_price that are quite explicative becuase are referring to "entry/exit" of the price table
[14:30:51] <pycode> however schinckel i suppose that i have to create a manytomany relation
[14:31:31] <pycode> but the problem here is that i need to get many prices at once around 5/10k so if i add a manytoman y django will create an additional query with a looong list of ids to retrieve
[14:31:59] <pycode> but i suppose adding manytomany i can deal with filteredrelated to create a left join instead of that additional query
[14:32:55] <pycode> i know that multiple trade could refer to the same price (because those are coming from a different "strategy")

[14:43:59] <FunkyBob> loodoons: when you say 'uri param'
[14:44:10] <FunkyBob> do you mean a term in the url, or a querystring param?
[14:44:36] <loodoons> I'm not talking about query string param like ?param=value, I'm talking about /myparam :)
[14:44:51] <FunkyBob> then path() has ways to define patterns and types

[17:08:28] <mattm22> Does Django's default password hashing utilize 256-bit keys?
[17:09:35] <soxfoxrox> I am trying to create a wishlist app where the wisher can wish for an amount of something (e.g. 4 living room chairs). I then want the giver to be able to reserve one or more of those chairs, up to a maximum of any already reserved chairs. My question is: How can I calculate the number of remaining items and pass that number as a maximum value of the amount field to my form? https://dpaste.org/itcq
[17:10:26] <mattm22> sox, my preference is to not use forms.py at all
[17:19:45] <knbk> mattm22: what would password hashing use a key for?
[17:20:12] <mattm22> knbk: I guess I am totally out of my element here
[17:20:38] <mattm22> I don't know anything about encryption or hashing, so maybe I'm using incorrect verbiage
[17:21:27] <mattm22> I have a client that is requiring a standard for password encryption, and I am trying to determine if out of the box django meets those requirements
[17:21:37] <knbk> do you mean salt? i.e. a randomly generated value that's unique to the hash and saved along with it
[17:22:36] <knbk> do they require encryption on top of hashing? or what are their requirements?
[17:22:53] <mattm22> They have several options
[17:23:26] <mattm22> Symmetrtic key algos / Public Key algos / Hash functions / digital signature algos / key exchange
[17:23:46] <mattm22> I am guessing django utilizes a hash function to store passwords?
[17:24:18] <mattm22> At least that is what I am discerning from the docs
[17:24:27] <knbk> yes, a password hash function. By default is uses PBKDF2 with I believe SHA256
[17:24:59] <mattm22> Ok, I think I just figured it out. Yes, so SHA-256 is an option from them
[17:25:55] <knbk> (note that *just* SHA256 is terrible for hashing passwords, it has to be used as a building block for something like PBKDF2 which is designed for password hashing)

[17:29:05] <mattm22> What would your suggestion be to have stronger password encryption?
[17:29:31] <apollo13> one simply does not encrypt passwords

[17:29:53] <Wooble> depends if you're building a password manager :P

[17:32:42] <mattm22> They aren't mentioned specifically, their requirements reference standards in papers such as https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf
[17:33:21] <Wooble> mattm22: django's default is probably fine; use argon2 if they don't have stupid requirements about avoiding third-party dependencies.
[17:34:08] <Wooble> if they're badly summarizing NIST publications they probably want argon2 and don't know how to ask for it :)
[17:34:59] <apollo13> well if you want to follow the NIST recommendations fully then Django won't cut it by default
[17:35:35] <apollo13> last time I checked they wanted an extra salt that is not part of the stored data (which makes sense, but not done by Django ootb)
[17:35:44] <mattm22> It looks like argon2 could be easily implemented
[17:36:04] <apollo13> well yes, django has support for it :þ
[17:36:20] <Wooble> yeesh, that paper is from 2015 and still mentions SHA-1 which NIST deprecated like 4 years before it was written.
