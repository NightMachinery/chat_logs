[00:00:32] <murthy> anemic I mean
[00:00:47] <Chickie> you have to get tested by a doctor first, that is a medical question, the testing doctor can advise you with correct method
[00:01:08] <murthy> thats not possible for now, tell me a home remedy for now
[00:01:20] <murthy> I will try to see if thats possible in two days
[00:01:37] <Chickie> well advised
[00:01:54] <murthy> how long does it take for the blood levels to get back to normal?
[00:02:15] <Chickie> its different for every person, these are questions you must ask a medical professional
[00:04:39] <murthy> Chickie: ok
[00:05:13] <manicennui> Depends on the underlying cause. B12 deficiency is not uncommon, and it is safe to take B12.
[00:05:35] <manicennui> Iron is another one.

[00:07:56] <murthy> manicennui: For more than three years I was a vegan and I think that depleted the B12 as I didn't take care of the suppliments
[00:08:46] <morf> you think too much
[00:08:46] <murthy> manicennui: If I take vitamin supplements, how long will it take for the blood levels to be back to normal? 
[00:09:08] <manicennui> Assuming that is the problem, it will still depend.
[00:09:44] <murthy> morf: Seems like your are practicing/preparing yourself to be a homeless person
[00:10:03] <manicennui> You are better off looking for improvement after supplementing and then just continuing with the supplements if things improve.
[00:10:33] <manicennui> But as mentioned, you should really just talk to a doctor.
[00:11:22] <murthy> manicennui: ok I will do that
