[00:27:56] <pjb> In anycase you're ballistic with totally hypothetical cases, as I said, for what normal programmers want to do, it's trivial to easy, while in C, you have to go metaliguistical with at least a pre-processor, or eventually convert your cfront to a full c++ compiler, or whatever else.

[06:21:23] <skangas> Actually, it's pretty logical from the Elisp manual -> Positions -> Motion -> Text Lines
[06:21:38] <akater[m]> Tons of text, and overall not very useful, in my opinion.  Meanwhile, there's severe lack of examples and sometimes even type signatures for functions.

[06:22:20] <skangas> Agree to disagree :)
[06:22:31] <skangas> It could be better of course, and it does lack examples
[06:23:07] <skangas> I've been trying to push for more examples to be added, but it's a huge work that comes out to two large printed tomes so...
[06:23:46] <skangas> I think the new shortdoc feature in Emacs 28 will be a good complement to the manual, FWIW
[06:24:38] <akater[m]> This is the primary reason which prevents me from contributing to any project: I know I'll have to throw away 80% of what I'll write.
[06:24:50] <akater[m]> I don't mind adding examples but I never understand where to put them.

[09:15:03] <dale> bch`: The weird thing is that it seems widget-create takes (item "foo") but widget-radio-add-item needs (item :value "foo")?  I wonder if that's a bug, or at least unintentional behavior.
[09:15:41] <bch`> yes, I tried the former and failed.  I don't know much about eieio (which, I guess, is used with the :value initialization?)

[13:53:16] <piyo> ^k^nk

[15:25:38] <kilobug> codingquark: well, distributing the compressed files with NFS, Samba or SSHFS will be more efficient bandwidth-wise than streaming the uncompressed audio with pulseaudio; but 50 mbit/s should be more than enough in both cases, uncompressed CD-quality audio is merely 1.4 mbit/s or so

[16:54:50] <xheimlich> me and my wife (is it "I and my wife"?) have some differences in values re: raising our child. 
[16:55:03] <grym> 'my wife and i'
[16:55:18] <grym> (the trick to remembering that is that if you take out either clause you still get a valid sentence that way)
[16:55:20] <xheimlich> in spanish it's the other way around. funny that.
[16:55:53] <grym> i and my wife is also i think ok, but sounds odd(er)
[16:56:00] <grym> anyway, yes, welcome to being human and having a personality 
[16:56:07] <xheimlich> anyway. I was raised by musicians. My dad's a classical composer. My mom is more of a singer-songwriter, although they used to perform together too.

[16:56:53] <xheimlich> 6mo has a real liking for what I'd call fine music. Of course, I've been playing it to him since the second he was born (and before if that even has an effect). 
[16:57:05] <grym> yup, ears come online at about 30 weeks
[16:57:23] <xheimlich> now he watches me play the keyboard/piano and interrupts me if he's on my lap. Plays individual notes, very slowly. Doesn't just punch the thing.
[16:57:31] <grym> sounds nice!

[16:57:39] <xheimlich> Also doesn't play anything meaningful, alternates hands so it's jumping all over the place.
[16:58:04] <xheimlich> she'll go to the gym and I'll spend time with him, now on a floor mat, and sometimes music will be so enticing he'll forget the toys.
[16:58:37] <xheimlich> Anyway, I just said something like "looks like we're going to have to put this kid on Musical Initiation classes". (That's what they call it in Spanish, or at least what my dad does).
[16:59:09] <xheimlich> he also enjoys his mom's music, which is like 6 albums between joy division and new order. 
[17:00:22] <xheimlich> but anyway -- she was *pissed*. You can't force the child to go through that. I say, this would be when he's older, maybe 3 4 5 years old. He seems to enjoy music, let's see if it continues. You'll continue to force him/stimulate him until he does, she says. 
[17:01:32] <xheimlich> My wife can't tell a major chord from a minor chord, and can't stand a lot of "fine music" (lyrical singing, most jazz, really most everything "where's the chorus"). But I liked her enough that it didn't seem to matter.
[17:01:41] <xheimlich> Such strange ideas though.

[17:26:29] <xheimlich> I hold my child in my arms to soothe him to sleep. When we know what we're doing, this goes down in three, four minutes. Kid knows he wants to sleep, he just needs a little help still. Then he grows a little and I can't hold his legs right. Takes a few days. Kid needs to be hold firmly, but not tightly. Leave is legs too free and he can't focus on getting on the sleepy train. Hold them down and he fights 
[17:26:35] <xheimlich> you. That's synedoche for everything else, I theorize. Kids are the opposite of Buddhas, they have very little control of the "monkey", of their wandering attention. 
[17:27:07] <xheimlich> That's my "mental model" of encourage vs. force.

[20:04:30] <johnjay> then it punches the A or B thing above it to indicate a letter
[20:04:41] <johnjay> so each column is just a letter or number. lol

[20:13:31] <pjb> johnjay: I don't know how it was choosen originally to have one row per numbers, ease of punching them manually, or simplicity of the hardware to sort and search them.  Probably both.  If they had used a binary pattern, the hardware to sort them would have had to be more complicated (it wasn't electronic originally, purely mechanical).

[20:48:56] <pjb> Also, putting your data store on orbit or on the Moon (in a big monolith), could help preserve it. In space, until the novae, the only degrading catastrophes are asteroids and cosmic rays. If you can protect against cosmic rays, and disperse duplicates, you should be safe.

[23:54:49] <Bayes> for me Map has always been about vectorizing in "one dimension" only
[23:55:01] <nikola-> in scheme map can take multiple lists and the it can map a function that takes as many arguments as there are provided lists and apply it like that 
[23:55:15] <Bayes> and not mapping along a vector of "lists"
[23:55:19] <Bayes> yeah gotcha

[23:55:56] <artefact> cartesian product is somewhat rare, usually you want some zipping
