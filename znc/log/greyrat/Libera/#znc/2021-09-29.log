[05:48:23] <chalcedony> if you want to back up a zinc on a shell, which parts do i need to save?
[05:48:56] <MetaNova> chalcedony: all of ~/.znc
[05:50:08] <chalcedony> MetaNova, thank you, i'm not sure i see that?
[05:50:27] <tar_xvf> it is in your home directory but usually hidden because it has the . prefix
[05:50:43] <tar_xvf> if you do `ls -a` for example, that will show it
[05:50:53] <chalcedony> i'm using winscp 
[05:51:33] <MetaNova> chalcedony: ctrl+alt+h
[05:51:48] <MetaNova> that seems to be Show Hidden Files in WinSCP
[05:51:54] <chalcedony> ah :)
[05:53:39] <chalcedony> i did it, it says hidden files are turned on, i have myuser, znc-1.8.1 and znc-1.8.1.tar.gz
[05:55:17] <tar_xvf> it might have been installed somewhere else
[05:55:54] <tar_xvf> try running the znc binary and see where it says the config file is ([ .. ] Opening config [/home/znc/.znc/configs/znc.conf]...)
[05:56:52] <chalcedony> tar_xvf, um command for that?
[05:56:56] <tar_xvf> in the above example /home/znc is the home directory of my linux user for the znc server
[05:57:58] <tar_xvf> try running `znc` in your command line. 
[05:58:06] <chalcedony> ok
[05:58:55] <tar_xvf> im not sure how it is on windows but if you installed znc it probably put the binary somewhere where windows can find it if you type `znc` it will find it
[05:59:07] <tar_xvf> did you build and then install znc, not just unpack the tar file?
[06:01:48] <chalcedony> tar_xvf, it's on a ubuntu shell
[06:02:40] <tar_xvf> are you able to get it to run?
[06:02:54] <MetaNova> chalcedony: why do you not have regular SSH access?
[06:03:10] <MetaNova> because it sounds like you don't have/don't know how to use it
[06:03:47] <tar_xvf> are you trying to ssh into a ubuntu VM which is running znc?
[06:05:08] <chalcedony> the interface with winscp confuses me. i'm on windows here. i ssh'd into it
[06:05:11] <chalcedony> <chalcedny>  Opening config [/home/lhull/.znc/configs/znc.conf]...
[06:05:11] <chalcedony> <chalcedny> [ !! ] ZNC is already running on this config.
[06:05:12] <chalcedony> <chalcedny> [ ** ] Unrecoverable config error.
[06:05:40] <tar_xvf> ok, so change directory (`cd`) to /home/lhull/
[06:06:05] <tar_xvf> then the `.znc` directory in the working directory is the one MetaNova was talking about
[06:07:50] <Khaytsus> znc is already running, so what's confusing there?
[06:08:16] <chalcedony> i need to back it up, to windows here
[06:11:28] <chalcedony> would i need to shut it down first?
[06:11:52] <tar_xvf> i don't think so. It should be fine, especially the config files which are the most important part
[06:13:13] <tar_xvf> especially if you just `scp` the files over and don't modify them at all
[06:13:36] <chalcedony> i don't plan to modify anything
