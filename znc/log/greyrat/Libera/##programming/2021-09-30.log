[00:01:04] <Samian> I thought "bottleneck" makes sense only within the context of a pipeline.. Like a car assembly pipeline. The assembly line's output rate is determined by the speed of the slowest component

[00:01:34] <Samian> bottleneck essentially implies speed = max(time duration of each component)

[04:03:13] <CodePoint> karstensrage, xmpp might be better for direct messaging, but irc would be better for group chats.
[04:03:30] <karstensrage> hmm you have direct experience with that?
[04:03:30] <CodePoint> karstensrage, I believe xmpp supports chat rooms.
[04:04:24] <CodePoint> karstensrage, I don't have experience integrating a xmpp or irc server into a project no.  I do, however have experience working with the IRC protocol and am familiar with the xmpp protocol.

My understanding is that post increment has higher precendence over pre increment, so a++ will be 5 and then incremented to 6, ++a would be 7 and then a which is 7 so (5 + 7 +. 7) will give 19. also, when i do (++a + a + a++), it is returning 18, please help explaining

[06:40:09] <InPhase> Guest60: The ++ is not specified to finish evaluating before the rest of the expression.
[06:40:52] <Guest60> what do you mean by not specified? In operator precedence table, post operator have higher precedence over addition operator
[06:41:37] <InPhase> That doesn't mean it happens first.  This comes down to the sequencing rules, which are very different, and very poorly specified.

[11:15:52] <Kake> I'm making a data driven program that consists of objects with properties. What do you think would be a good way to represent conditionals? I was thinking either if(condition) ? set properties : set other properties. Or property = (condition) ? x : y. I think the first one is more intuitive to the designer, but the second is more flexible.

[16:24:33] <iridium__> gggpkm: do you want a function which gives generates one of two values with some assigned probability? that's the Bernoulli distribution. most random number generators in languages have a function which outputs some number less than a given number with uniform distribution.

[16:25:09] <mawk> yes pyzozord

[16:38:41] <pikapika> InPhase, hi
[16:38:47] <InPhase> Hi.
[16:40:11] <pikapika> InPhase, many persons prefer just directly writing the algorithms as needed
[16:40:14] <mawk> gggpkm: if you know the probability distribution function of a distribution, you can generate random values that follow this distribution using the inverse transform method
[16:40:20] <pikapika> numpy is quite large
[16:40:31] <mawk> you can also use the rejection method
[16:41:01] <InPhase> gggpkm: Oh, I see above you want to also know the algorithms.  Each distribution has a different algorithm, and there are often multiple valid algorithms.  The code for each of those is open source, so you can look at how they actually did it.  But you can also google for varieties of algorithms for sampling numbers from each distribution of interest to you.
[16:41:04] <mawk> you need to have a uniform distribution generator, and you give the uniform values to the inverse of the cdf of the distribution you want

[16:41:37] <mawk> the rejection method works even if you don't know the analytical inverse cdf: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejection_sampling
[16:41:38] <bayaz> Title: Rejection sampling - Wikipedia 
[16:42:04] <InPhase> gggpkm: Often there is a naive algorithm, and sometimes there is a more efficient algorithm for a particular distribution, with the more efficient one sometimes being a little trickier to understand.  But usually they're all out there in multiple copies and variations to read the source of.
[16:42:13] <mawk> to make a normal distribution you can feed uniform sampled values to erfâ»Â¹ in the right way, and you get a normal distribution
[16:42:58] <mawk> intuitively it's easy to understand, you look at the cdf graph and you pick a y value uniformly, then read the corresponding x-value to get the random number according to the distribution
[16:43:28] <mawk> if the cdf is very steep at the start, which means most values are picked from the start of the interval, then your randomly-chosen y will be most likely in the start

[16:44:10] <mawk> the rejection method involves throwing away values but it easier to program
[16:44:48] <InPhase> I once wrote my own ERF to get better results than the built-in.  I wrote a numerical integrator to do it.  These can all be hand-rolled if desired or needed.
[16:45:17] <mawk> nice
[16:45:27] <mawk> in maths school the final year paper was on polynomial approximation of awful function
[16:45:27] <InPhase> I went with the Romberg algorithm.
[16:45:33] <mawk> I took erf as my example of awful function
[16:45:57] <pikapika> mawk, doesn't it have a tolerable series expansion
[16:46:16] <mawk> I don't know, the goal is to do better than the taylor expansion pikapika 
[16:46:27] <pikapika> oh ok
[16:46:32] <mawk> so even if it has, you can do better than taylor if your goal is "precision over the whole interval"
[16:46:32] *** Joins: The_Blode (~Blode@user/the-blode/x-7164444)
[16:46:51] <mawk> taylor is only precise around the expansion point, and it usually diverges away from it
[16:47:06] <mawk> but with the right trick you can distribute the error more or less uniformly on the whole interval and get a polynomial that is precise everywhere
[16:48:05] <mawk> one such trick is to expand using taylor at say degree 10, then do some vodoo on the polynomial to cut it at degree 5 while distributing the error more uniformly, and you get a degree 5 polynomial that is more precise on the whole interval than the degree 5 taylore expansion
[16:48:19] <mawk> said vodoo is using chebyshev polynomials as your basis
[16:48:35] <pikapika> Interesting
[16:48:54] <pikapika> So if you express the expansion with chebychevs it is more accurate?
[16:48:55] *** Quits: cm007magnum (~Rheanna@218.78.88.163) (Remote host closed the connection)
[16:49:00] <mawk> you take the degree 10 polynomial in {X^k}, you re-express it in the base of {T_k}, and you cut the expansion at degree 5, then convert back to base {X^k}
[16:49:07] <pikapika> Oh
[16:49:09] <mawk> and at the end you have a degree 5 polynomial with good error distribution
[16:49:34] <pikapika> so if we rewrite the 10th degree poly as a sum of 10 chebychevs and then discard all terms higher than 5th degree
[16:49:37] <mawk> yes
[16:49:38] <pikapika> the result is more accurate?
[16:49:40] <mawk> yeah

[16:57:42] <mawk> see the last graph in the notebook pikapika , that's how the chebyshev error will always look
[16:57:53] <mawk> it always oscillates between some +Îµ and -Îµ, basically
[16:57:57] <merijn> Note that -j is usually a bad idea
[16:58:10] <merijn> Unless your build system is shit and not very parallel :p
[16:58:34] <merijn> In fact, "-j $nproc" is already a bad idea, generally I'd go with "number of cores - 1" or -2
[16:58:48] <pikapika> mawk, it looks like a quartic curve
[16:59:25] <mawk> yeah that's just coincidence pikapika , it will rather always look like something period
[16:59:31] <pyzozord> im always curious how does number of threads really map to (v)cpus really
[16:59:33] <mawk> oscillating between -Îµ and +Îµ
[17:00:01] <pyzozord> say you have 4 cpus, and you give it even -j 3. How do you know it won't schedule all three jobs in single cpu
[17:00:17] <merijn> pyzozord: You don't

[17:01:40] <merijn> pyzozord: Which is also the reason you don't wanna use threads = cores, because there is usually *other* stuff on your machine you want to run (OS code, background processes, your UI, etc.) and it's usually wise to keep a core free so your machine doesn't feel sluggish
[17:02:12] <pyzozord> yeah that makes sense

[18:44:47] <InPhase> Izem: But when I see applicants with that thinking, I end up calculating that I will need to pay that person plus someone else to fix their work before it can be released.  So they have to be X amount better at their core job before it is worth paying them plus paying someone else to fix up any documents they make.
[18:45:24] <Izem> I guess
[18:45:37] <InPhase> Izem: Which is a mindset I've heard a lot from other hiring managers.
[18:46:09] <Izem> hmm, guess I'm not management material then :P
[18:46:18] <InPhase> There's nothing wrong with hiring some specialized skill people, but they have to be very good to be worth it, and you have to pay for enough support staff to make it work out then.
[18:46:55] <Izem> I can't imagine you would need a lot, depends how many departments are making requests for documents I guess
[18:46:58] <InPhase> So if you can flaunt a little diversity in skills at the application point, you seem like a better deal, but without too much effort on your part.

[18:50:55] <pyzozord> aren't they

[18:51:32] <Izem> sure, but I'm not taking about technical ones
[18:51:54] <pyzozord> I think everone has a sense of esthetics
[18:52:25] <pyzozord> as simple ugly, nice
[18:52:26] <InPhase> Izem: I don't know about that.  I look for design skill in programmers.  It's important to be able to take stakeholder requests and formulate an interface design that is both code-viable and satisfies the external requirements.  Because one thing that's certain is that stakeholders are usually not good designers, and aren't usually putting much thought into the realities of their requests.
[18:52:29] <Izem> yeah, just like the people that designed the houses I've lived in, they made terrible decisions
[18:53:13] <InPhase> Izem: I also find that interface design skill has a huge overlap with API design skill.
[18:53:29] <InPhase> An API after all is a human interface for a programmer.
[18:53:39] <Izem> yes, that is a good point
[18:53:41] <pyzozord> ^
[18:54:17] <Izem> when I say design, I mean with respect to style and some other ui considerations
[18:54:53] <pyzozord> you can produce interface that doesn't look great, but still is very functional and makes a lot of sense

[18:55:20] <InPhase> I deal with far too much legacy code where the API does not appear to have been designed for interfacing purposes, but was patched together based on conveniences of code internal structure.  This results in cumulative architectural chaos.  So I have my team constantly asserting effort to remedy these issues in legacy code.
[18:55:31] <pyzozord> I find the biggest factor is just keeping things neat. That one pixel off really does make a difference.
[18:55:47] <Izem> then again, I'm highly visual person, so I really appreciate good documents. You can't really make these without being a specialist
[18:55:54] <Izem> that sounds difficult to work with
[18:56:46] <pyzozord> I think many people who are programmers identify as such and just don't /want/ to care about how their work looks. But they certainly do care how how other things they use look

[20:20:03] <InPhase> Sounds more on point.  Then speak explicitly to the parts that were confusing you, and how you got past it.
[20:20:35] <pyzozord> I poked a bit more and it turned out that the disks connected to those gitlab runners were nfs and extremly slow, however we had a nice a fast connection to internal docker repository. So I used that docker images as cache storage, and improved pipeline time from 15-20 to 3-5 minutes

[21:29:39] <pulse> not that kind of interview!
[21:29:58] <LambdaComplex> it's running on EC2 instances that are part of autoscaling groups, so sometimes those EC2 instances get destroyed and replaced with new ones!

[21:30:29] <LambdaComplex> so now the record is pointing to The Wrong Addresses
[21:30:34] <CoderGuy> oh cool we're chatting
[21:30:46] <LambdaComplex> does me venting about shitty architecture count as chatting?
[21:30:49] <CoderGuy> if a Window is a View, where does a panel go? in Display, View or Container?
[21:30:50] <LambdaComplex> if so: HECK YEAH WE ARE
[21:31:00] <user51> LambdaComplex: which uarch
[21:31:05] <pyzozord> Now the interesting part. Two of the elements X and Y are not given. Find those two elements so that the result is Z

[23:01:08] <derjanni> InPhase: just out of curiousity
[23:01:37] <derjanni> The language itself is funny, but the environments supporting it are completely dated.
[23:01:51] <derjanni> Also I think the batch processing paradigm surrounding COBOL is dated
[23:02:18] <InPhase> Yeah.  I glanced at the language enough to get a sense for why people working with it complain.  :)

[23:02:59] <derjanni> I somewhat stumbled across a larger cobol codebase a while ago and was shocked. The programming style back in the 80s was just a nightmare. Its practically formulas smushed together into a huge pile of files with pure nonsense.
[23:03:21] *** Joins: vdamewood (~vdamewood@fedora/vdamewood)
[23:03:22] <derjanni> You'd be surprised how many large financial businesses (especially insurances) dont even know how their cobol code works anymore.
[23:03:46] <derjanni> theyll calculate insurance claims and premiums with algorithms that they cant even control or cross-check
[23:03:47] <InPhase> Well keep in mind the point of COBOL back then was that it was a language simple enough for non-programmers to write reports in.
[23:04:02] <InPhase> So consequently we can expect it to lack even the software engineering standards of its own time.
[23:04:09] <vdamewood> Damn real life getting in the way of my IRCing.
[23:04:41] <derjanni> InPhase: I think it's far worse than that. Most of the code doesnt have ANY documentation or had written paper docs that vanished decades ago
[23:04:50] <derjanni> Most cobol codebases are 30+ years old
[23:05:03] <vdamewood> I'm a cobol codebase!
[23:05:15] <InPhase> derjanni: It wasn't common to have a documentation website at that time.  :)
[23:06:02] <derjanni> I once wrote a popular article about cobol and its meaning in our day and age. It gained some attention and I got into the inner circles of the cobol people. My article was also distributed by IBM.

[23:07:13] <vdamewood> Well, I wouldn't have a problem with MIT or 2- or -3-clause BSD licenses, but they might.
[23:07:25] <InPhase> derjanni: A lot of the resistance to replacement seems to be the size of the COBOL code in use.  But I often find myself wondering how many lines of modern code it would take for replacement.
[23:07:38] <vdamewood> pyzozord: They have their own licenses that require, among other things, that if you edit a file you rename it.
[23:07:45] <InPhase> derjanni: Newer languages with modern methods tend to be MUCH more compact.

[23:09:33] <derjanni> I met a cobol guy working for a bank that said; the bank is unable to verify the calculation of interest rates, penalties etc. because they dont even understand the code anymore.
[23:09:40] <derjanni> They just keep the bugs running.
[23:09:57] <derjanni> vdamewood: go with GnuCOBOL on your Mac/Win/Linux machine
[23:10:12] <vdamewood> GNU? Really. I'm surprised they even care.

[23:10:51] <vdamewood> well, it should work for learning anyhow. Thanks.
[23:10:52] <derjanni> theres really nothing to maintain with GnuCOBOL
[23:11:26] <derjanni> vdamewood: the mainframes these days pretty much just wrap APIs (XML, JSON) around legacy COBOL code for Java,C,C# apps to call the legacy code
[23:11:44] <vdamewood> derjanni: i know. I've done that kind of thing myself.
[23:11:46] <derjanni> so the old UI stuff in COBOL is pretty much gone and replaced with compatible APIs
[23:11:58] <InPhase> derjanni: I don't know.  I have a lot of really old mathematical C code, and it drops by several multiples when I rewrite the same in C++.  When I do it in Python it drops by another decent multiplicative factor in size.
[23:12:01] <derjanni> vdamewood: which industry if I might ask?
[23:12:10] <vdamewood> derjanni: steel
[23:12:13] <derjanni> nice
[23:12:38] <InPhase> derjanni: Just going C to Python can drop math code size by a factor of more than 10-20.

[23:52:01] <derjanni> Ever since the early 2000s i dont see much progress in open source and it seems the scene has lost traction. What u think?
[23:52:07] <SaulgoodmanBot> why would u want such a world
[23:52:42] <pulse> i don't mind closed source at all
[23:52:50] <SaulgoodmanBot> there is a world full of compiled completely obfuscated non accessible binary executables isnt it great

[23:53:18] <vdamewood> derjanni: If you haven't seen much progress in the open source community since the early 2000s, you haven't been looking.

[23:54:01] <derjanni> vdamewood: I am looking. Trust me.
[23:54:08] <diophantoz> because GPL
[23:54:11] <vdamewood> diophantoz: Sure you can. Lots of people do it.
[23:54:11] *** Joins: Spydar007 (~spydar007@user/spydar007)
[23:54:17] <pulse> diophantoz, you can create content with GPL licensed programs
[23:54:18] <vdamewood> diophantoz: Not all open-source software is GPL.
[23:54:22] <diophantoz> it's against the spirit of linnix
[23:54:29] <pulse> gimp is GPL yet i can use it to make graphics for my closed source game
[23:54:33] <derjanni> Ive seen enough closed source SaaS with GPLv2 in it.
[23:54:41] <derjanni> How would someone ever find it?
[23:54:48] <SaulgoodmanBot> linux too has vulnarabilities, easier to spot than in windows since its open source, which one do u place ur bets one
[23:54:57] <pulse> ah yes the "spirit of linux". crashing randomly and endlessly misconfigured ;)
[23:54:57] <diophantoz> is is the against the core beliefs of OS
[23:54:58] <SaulgoodmanBot> on*
[23:55:06] <vdamewood> Well, the GPL doesn't prevent SaaS. That's what the AGPL is for.
[23:55:13] <diophantoz> and morals
[23:55:21] <vdamewood> Well, not really preventing, more like keeping it free.

[23:55:57] <derjanni> There are a lot of unethical people out there trying to make a quick buck with ugly PHP nonsense
[23:56:05] <diophantoz> so it's open source code that permits commercial use?
[23:56:21] <vdamewood> diophantoz: All open-source code permits commercial use.
[23:56:34] <pulse> *using* opensource software is not *including* it in your project :p
[23:56:34] <derjanni> under conditions.
[23:56:38] <pulse> you can use GIMP all you want
[23:56:45] <pulse> or vim, etc
[23:56:50] <vdamewood> It's in both the OSI definition of open-source, and the Free Software Foundations 4 freedoms.
[23:56:53] <diophantoz> vdamewood, not without releasing it as open source
[23:57:00] <SaulgoodmanBot> same story as in most music productions, who is ever going to find out which stolen open/closed software u used or not
[23:57:04] <derjanni> I had people using my code in their applications. And it was GPL.
[23:57:04] <diophantoz> that's the whole point of GPL
[23:57:09] <vdamewood> diophantoz: You said *use*, not incorperate. That's a different thing.
[23:57:32] <diophantoz> vdamewood, not sure what you mean
[23:57:48] <derjanni> A large portion of the video streaming "services" are abusing GPL

[23:58:04] <diophantoz> i thought we were talking about releasing closed source apps based on opens ource software
[23:58:04] <oldlaptop> diophantoz: For an, um, an articulation of the open-source attitude towards *use* restrictions: https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-cvs&m=99118909527873&w=2
[23:58:08] <bayaz> Title: 'CVS: cvs.openbsd.org: src' - MARC 
[23:58:08] <vdamewood> diophantoz: The GPL has restrictions on incorperating a GPL'd work into another work. But as for just using the program, there are no restrictions.
[23:58:26] <diophantoz> yes, you can use an app?
[23:58:27] <oldlaptop> (the openbsd people are more liberal in many ways than the FSFites, but on this particular subject they all vehemently agree)
[23:58:36] <diophantoz> but that wasn't the topic
[23:59:03] <vdamewood> diophantoz: Yes it was.  -->   <pulse> but i'll create large portions of it using open source software
[23:59:16] <diophantoz> vdamewood, yes you are right
[23:59:19] <diophantoz> i misread
[23:59:25] <diophantoz> and misinterpreted
[23:59:50] <diophantoz> that's fine, that is within the ethics of OS core beliefs
