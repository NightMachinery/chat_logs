[00:01:15] <Guest49> yeah
[00:01:23] <kzootech> actualy debugging can be quite a bit more powerful i think
[00:01:26] <quippy> plus if you ship those statements to a log gatherer, and leave them turned on, you get the ability to do adequate post-mortems of software that fails in places you don't have access to
[00:01:36] <kzootech> and you can accidentally leave debug stuff in your output

[00:01:54] <InPhase> Guest49: There's nothing wrong with print debugging.  It is one of the best first-choice tools.
[00:02:01] <kzootech> and you dont have to recompile to "take a closer look"
[00:02:09] <poprocks> for me, one thing I find is I start to put print-debugging messages everywhere, to the point that it (a) takes up half my code, and (b) creates so much console spew that I almost can't even sort out what's what. and when the debugger can tell you what you want to know and in the context of actually debugging as opposed to wading through just tons of spurious debug messages to find what you're 
[00:02:12] <InPhase> Log debugging is great too.  It's basically just print debugging scaled up.

[00:02:58] <InPhase> poprocks: Well generally you only print debug the range of things you're exploring for a particular problem.
[00:03:02] <quippy> error handling takes up more lines of code than anything else, that's just how it goes

[00:03:52] <kzootech> stepping through code can be nice too
[00:04:06] <kzootech> if you are having some weird issue you can track down 
[00:04:27] <kzootech> where is that pointer actually pointing?
[00:04:40] <InPhase> Print debugging also works in release mode, relieving you from the chaos of trying to debug and test in one build condition, then shipping code in a release build that you haven't properly tested and that might not behave like the thing you sat there and debugged.

[00:09:29] <kzootech> when, clearly, the computer is telling a different story
[00:09:42] <peteyboy1> consultor/consultant
[00:09:42] <pyzozord> I tend to agree with Ken Thompson in principle, but it also sounds like you have to have a big brain to just think about things, and I often don't. In practice I tend to use the debugger more than thinking, but usually combine the two
[00:09:45] *** Joins: arcatech (~arcatech@user/arcatech)

[00:10:10] <InPhase> peteyboy1: They exist.  They're just a small fraction.
[00:10:40] <peteyboy1> InPhase, is it because there simply is not a lot of work that way or do people simply not choose to work that way?
[00:10:42] <kzootech> pyzozord: well he is also not the one at the computer in the story, so quite naturally his job is to think about the problem, while in the same light the person in charge the keyboard should be doing the debugging
[00:10:59] <kzootech> because often a bit of both are needed anyway
[00:11:01] <Guest49> I think explaining the code to yourself is a very effective method of debugging as well. Often when I go to some place to ask a question, I would append some code, explain my issue and then often cancel asking the question because I figured it out as I wrote the question because I explained it in more detail
[00:11:12] <pyzozord> kzootech: yeah, I guess I'm more of the keyboard person
[00:11:19] <kzootech> but ken is also just free to think in that case because he happens to be a slower typer
[00:11:36] <InPhase> pyzozord: I don't doubt Ken Thompson had a big effective brain.  But part of it is about finding a way to train yourself to think about what code is doing when you only have hints of behavior.  You have to make abstracted models to heuristically guess at code behavior, and use them to reduce code symptoms down to bug possibilities to explore.

[00:13:20] <InPhase> kzootech: Right.  But applying that solo means that sometimes you just stop touching the keyboard to solve a code problem.  And then when you DO touch the program, instead of trying to directly find the bug, try to reason about what information will point you in the categorical direction of the bug.
[00:13:31] <pyzozord> in practice when I try to solve competetive programming problems in my head I tend to fail miserably for anything more than the easy problems
[00:13:50] <kzootech> InPhase: yes... i guess im saying there isnt one way to go about it
[00:14:05] <InPhase> kzootech: Which is great, because the first way rarely works.  ;)

[00:48:05] <quippy> I can't speak for that, when Python doesn't cut it I use Go 
[00:48:12] <peteyboy1> is there a big drawback to using them for not-enterprise level projects?
[00:48:15] <pyzozord> peteyboy1: but if you are looking for just new ideas I'd reach further, lisp/haskell or things like apl they seem to have potential to really kind of overload web devs like us with tons of fresh ideas
[00:48:28] <pyzozord> haha "webdevs like us" sorry this sounded strange
[00:48:29] <quippy> no peteyboy1 I know people who really like modern Java and would probably use it in their spare time

[00:51:25] <quippy> people might argue that dynamically-typed languages are faster to develop than statically-typed ones but I've never seen hard evidence of that
[00:51:26] <kzootech> you will just be mostly stuck on microsoft platforms
[00:51:39] <peteyboy1> like, is node much more popular in the "simple" web circles because all the C# programmers are already busy with more complicated and better paid jobs?
[00:51:51] <quippy> ah yeah that's a good point, does server-side C# require running a Windows server? *grimaces*

[01:27:30] <peteyboy1> to all: i think i wasn't perfectly clear. until i save up the desired amount, i definitely will be doing a shitton of work and studying. the "working 6 hours per day" is for when i have already achieved what i want (getting a property, etc)
[01:28:13] <adder`> (anyone remember what was the initial question)
[01:28:17] <InPhase> peteyboy1: After 3-6 months of Python, and making a few different types of project programs with it, pick another language and try that, aiming for something else.  Make some desktop programs, make some server-side software, maybe make a phone app.  See what's exciting.
[01:28:54] <kzootech> yeah, try out many languages, different KINDS of languages, etc
[01:29:19] <pyzozord> in general knowing what one wants is the hardest thign. If I truly knew what I wanted I would have gotten it by now
[01:29:21] <quippy> quick, learn OCaml!
[01:29:26] <peteyboy1> InPhase, what i do like about webdev though is the versatility, everything is on the internet and everone needs something on the internet. although not one of the "that's what i enjoy" reasons, it is one of the reasons that makes me perhaps want to specialize in it
[01:29:53] <kzootech> i dont think you can really become an expert in any one language until you have learned several languages
[01:30:15] <quippy> "what i do like about webdev though is the versatility, everything is on the internet and everone needs something on the internet" blah! the Internet and the Web are different things
[01:30:48] <peteyboy1> InPhase, i'm glad you mentioned a broader experience, it's the reason why i was initially inquiring about C# and java, because they are less similar to what i already know
[01:30:49] <quippy> lately I've been toying around with the question "okay, what kind of non-Web Internet application could I write that can do something the Web cannot?"
[01:31:39] <peteyboy1> kzootech, nah, i'm not saying i want to be an expert in one language, i meant more specialize more in webdev than mobile app or desktop app making
[01:31:46] <pyzozord> quippy: there is less and less of these

[01:31:57] <peteyboy1> sorry, that was for kzootech 
[01:32:26] <kzootech> you still need to know multiple languages 
[01:32:34] <peteyboy1> damn, i did quote kzootech... lol
[01:32:45] <pyzozord> peteyboy1: something that might come in useful is getting familiar with amazon or google cloud and also kubernetes. Many companies use this nowadays

[01:39:16] <quippy> almost nothing, but you're looking to learn stuff
[01:39:20] <quippy> it's slightly different

[01:43:24] <deniska> writing wasm by hand is actually fun though :D
[01:43:29] <kzootech> with webasm you can write client-side C for the web
[01:43:37] <quippy> yeah but whyyy
[01:43:48] <kzootech> because
[01:43:53] <quippy> I for one love introducing segfaults into client side code (??????)
[01:44:26] <quippy> I would like to learn Rust so that I can use it for client-side web code though, unironically
[01:44:28] <kzootech> they had to reduce the webasm timer precision
[01:44:48] <pyzozord> one benefit of that is that you understand wasm better and are more comfortable debugging it by hand if something crashes in a compiled code and noone can figure out why because they don't have debugging symbols :D
[01:44:49] <kzootech> because you could potentially do some nice attacks with the system-precision timer 
[01:44:55] <kzootech> in webasm
[01:45:10] <quippy> timing attacks, man
[01:45:13] <quippy> they'll get you every time
[01:45:22] <peteyboy1> what about, instead of learning a new language, i focus all my efforts on improving what i know and building on top of it?

[01:45:36] <peteyboy1> i don't know. gatsby, jest...
[01:45:52] <quippy> why not write something like Gatsby from scratch in JS as an exercise

[01:46:38] <kzootech> build your own flask like framework in python

[01:47:11] <peteyboy1> pyzozord, yeah, i also feel knowing a bit of this and a bit of that won't get me far in terms of finding my first job. it's better to know a lot of this exclusively

[01:47:40] <quippy> it wasn't very featureful and I stopped using it because it was turning into Bad Hugo but ya know
[01:47:52] <pyzozord> quippy: there is more to gatsby, you can get quite indepth when writing gatsby plugins and themes, it's pretty interesting, graphq, quasi-compiler stuff like parsing nodes etc
[01:47:54] <peteyboy1> pyzozord, no, it won't. but maybe i'm not really ready for broadening horizons? i don't know. i have only done basic routes and node. i don't even know how much more it is capable of
[01:48:01] <quippy> oh I wrote a weird custom one in Python for a family member once too
[01:48:25] <kzootech> mine just "compiles" md to html
[01:48:28] <quippy> sure pyzozord I didn't mean that peteyboy1 needs to write a full-featured competitor to Gatsby
[01:48:29] <pyzozord> peteyboy1: if you haven't gotten your first full time job yet, I'd just focus on that
[01:49:03] <quippy> it's a learning exercise pyzozord, if he was asking what static site generator to use for that purpose, I'd have different feedback. But a static site generator is a good small project
[01:49:08] <peteyboy1> quippy, it is a static site generator, but i have no idea how it works in depth. i though that if it were easy to build something like that on one's own, everyone would be doing that
[01:49:37] <quippy> sounds like a good learning experience, then, yours doesn't have to be as full-featured
[01:49:52] <quippy> like I said, I have done that, on multiple occasions. You can cut down a lot on features when you're the only user

[01:50:23] <quippy> generating static sites is, in fact, quite easy, you just take in some input format or provide UI in some way to input content, and generate HTML with templating

[01:50:56] <peteyboy1> i could also improve my UX/UI skills...

[01:51:52] <pyzozord> that is true

[02:19:31] <peteyboy1> pyzozord, if for any reason you end up in a conflict with a client, you drop the project, return the money, whatever the process. but that's it, you already have a routine in looking for clients, and if you're good at it, you maybe even have clients waiting in line for your service.

[03:24:28] <jeaye> If you really like sushi, but your partner doesn't, it would be the kind thing to do to not keep choosing a sushi restaurant every time you go out.
[03:24:49] <matiss> jeaye, I fail to see how this analogy applies
[03:25:21] <jeaye> If you use the term "master" for a branch, but someone you care about says it makes them uncomfortable, it would be the kind thing to do to use "main" instead.
[03:25:37] <lavadonut> pretty sure anyone who suffers from any actual discrimination has bigger things to worry about than historical language holdovers that no one else consciously thinks about
[03:25:57] <lavadonut> pay attention to who exactly complains about that stuff
[03:26:12] <jeaye> If you use the term "guys", but someone you care about says that it's not inclusive enough, it would be the kind thing to do to use "folks" or something else instead.
[03:26:16] <matiss> jeaye, why just someone I care about?
[03:26:41] <matiss> So you are saying issues of people I don't care about have no bearing and weight because I don't?
[03:27:01] <jeaye> Because it's easier for us to imagine this when it's someone close to us. Then the question is simply: why only show kindness to them?

[03:34:47] <nitrix> Once you've dealt with your immediate survival / basic needs, you're enabling your focus to shift to other concerns that previously felt insignificant in comparison. The new issues aren't treats to your survival, but they could be treats to your peers, or role in society, or how your happiness, or day-to-day interactions, so on.
[03:35:13] <nitrix> It gets into psychology territory, but I wouldn't say those issues are completely irrelevant even if you don't care about them.

As far as I'm concerned, that's out of reach for me so I focus on my area of expertise. I'll have debates about frameworks, programming language design, what consistitute "good" or "idiomatic" code, etc. To an outsider, that kind of bickering is completely nonsense, it's something virtual that is completely irrelevant to them.

[03:56:00] <matiss> nitrix, none of what you listed is nonsense, it's a technical debate and is very much relevant to quality and progress of said domain

[04:14:25] <piou> Nigeria comes from the Niger river which doesn't come from the latin Niger (black) but from berber. Given the colonialism that plagued the continent it was not obvious that there was no common root with the american "niger". I learned something.

[04:14:55] <nitrix> matiss, For what it's worth, my git branches are named master and they'll renamed named that way because I happen to be on your side that it's not something of importance... _to me_. I know it'll anger some people and I know they'll keep bringing it up, but I simply don't care, for the same reasons as you. But. I also don't think every little benign thing is actually useless, as I'm the first to complain about incorrect indentation or whitespaces, 
[04:14:55] <nitrix> which are also seemingly benign but can end up statistically reducing defects in your code when you're rigorous.
[04:15:38] <arahael> yeah.  a few months ago i renamed almost all occurences of "master" to something else.  it was very simple, with only a few excemptions.
[04:15:54] <arahael> (eg, i'm not renaming "MasterCard")
[04:16:14] <nitrix> matiss, I think developers are pretty hypocrite in that regards, we do far worse arguing over even less (directly) significant things for society, but also (most) significant things, considering the software we write affects everyone at large.
[04:16:22] <nitrix> So that's my stance.
[04:16:35] <matiss> arahael, yeah, so imagine someone for example not even aware of SL, telling you to stop using that sign simply because
[04:16:48] <matiss> nitrix, I think this needs to be approached pragmatically. Simple as that
[04:17:44] <piou> one issue I have with the change of master to main is that the word "master" just doesn't evoke slavery to most non-american people, far from it. So as well intentioned as it may be it sounds like one more time where american views are pushed onto the rest of the world and it just isn't nice.
[04:17:52] <nitrix> matiss, Everyone is going to agree with that, except everyone will have a different definition of what's pragmatic.
[04:17:53] <^-^hi> piou: So many other black countries are named after their people's color (Sudan, Guinea) and it is of the same root as latin "black", that it makes it the most plausible explanation.
[04:17:58] <nitrix> matiss, You're falling for the same trap again.
[04:18:18] <nitrix> You can't say "what's common sense", or "what's pragmatic", that doesn't work.
[04:18:39] <piou> ^-^hi: yep, but apparently in this case it would be a wrong one
[04:18:42] <matiss> nitrix, does "result in more measurable common good for society at large" work?
[04:19:14] <nitrix> matiss, It's a start, until someone does p-hacking.

[04:34:03] <InPhase> ^-^hi: shiftwidth and tabstop are important entries, expandtab is helpful, as are autoindent and smartindent.
[04:34:16] <matiss> that and other ways on how to piss of everyone
[04:34:39] <InPhase> ^-^hi: The listchars is for visually displaying tabs so they don't surprise you with alignment issues.
[04:34:42] <^-^hi> leduyquang753, yes, the problem is that many editors and stuff (tmux) copy tab as spaces.
[04:34:44] <matiss> trolling aside, imo most editors today support .editorconfig, right
[04:35:00] <InPhase> ^-^hi: Then there are keyboard shortcuts set for turning on/off the visual displaying of tabs.
[04:35:04] <matiss> so project specific, whatever applies to the codebase, but I too prefer 2 spaces
[04:35:46] <leduyquang753> ^-^hi Terminals don't quite know tab characters are there.
[04:36:28] <^-^hi> unfortunately, i have also heard of editors messing it up as well
[04:36:40] <^-^hi> and evil formats such as yaml banning it
[04:36:56] <^-^hi> and python yelling at me for mixing it with spaces
[04:37:22] <matiss> ah, something we can all hate universally - yaml
[04:37:23] <InPhase> Python recommended styles have pretty much universally agreed to ban tabs.

[04:40:35] <Hitchens> Link: Franca programming language specification / Matīss Treinis
[04:42:06] <^-^hi> so, i am better with 2 spaces. our dear, ascii control character was stabbed in back. 2 spaces is practical to enter by hand and you can get reasonable indentation without having to had config'd anything this way.
[04:43:14] <poprocks> why is everyone and their dog trying to write their own programming language? Don't we have too many as it is? Let's redirect these efforts to cutting a few languages!
[04:43:17] <^-^hi> ah yes, yet another paradigm-loving scripting language
[04:43:23] <arahael> InPhase: To be fair, that was becuase mixing tabs and spaces was so badly done in python.  python3 does it much better.
[04:43:37] <matiss> poprocks, because it's cool and all the cool kids are doing it
[04:43:53] <phogg> poprocks: there is no such thing as too many
[04:44:00] <matiss> ^-^hi, in what sense?
[04:44:23] <InPhase> poprocks: Yeah, there are clearly too many languages.  We could solve this problem if we create a language which serves all the needs of a bunch of other languages.
[04:45:18] <matiss> fair warning, from the start I was never considering to implement this, mostly because I simply wouldn't have time for it, but I have been discussing the concepts in some other places, and this has popped up once or twice, so I asking, amm, wider audience :D

[04:55:19] <InPhase> ^-^hi: Two tabs?  Everyone knows you should use 8 tabs!
[04:55:23] <matiss> ^-^hi, yeah, from python perspective it could come off that way, but think of this as a "flip" instead - you don't need to add the underscore for private stuff (which is usually majority), and have to add it to public stuff you really want public
[04:56:11] <matiss> so vice versa, and no real complexity added. you expect someone to consume X publicly, add public. Everything else is internal detail by default

A lot of stuff in a lot of decades have been developed in languages with no information hiding, and I don't see many people having problems with information not being hidden, it is mostly promoted by language designers from above.

[07:28:50] <Batzy> so the person said "already logged in to steam", so yes they could already be logged in to steam or we would need them to. This is because with something like openid you are going to redirect the user to steam anyways and then steam would return something like an id token or access token

[11:13:55] <Guest24> Hello. I am having conceptual issues about how to implement redis queue processing in nodejs express backend server - specifically, I am not sure how to "time" the processing - in nodejs, being asynchronous, I could use setInterval to continously work on the redis queue, but this comes with its own set of issues (setup in a backend server
[11:13:56] <Guest24> environment), or I could create a new NodeJs process/thread (threads have been afaik added in recent years) but this requires even more setup. The last option afaik is to create a endpoint /process_queue and call it via a cron job)) - what is the default gotoway of doing this in a webserver/webdev environment?
[11:15:05] <deniska> Guest24: there's a subscription mechanism in redis, and I'd expect node bindings to provide the mechanism to, well, subscribe to it :)

[11:18:15] <Guest24> deniska: I am not quite sure I follow, does this mean, that, in essence, redis is the signalling when something should happen, and my nodejs process reacts to it by subscribing to this "event"?

[11:20:33] <mrig> Well that works, I shall go with that for now; There is something so curious about bitwise math, fun though.
[11:20:43] <deniska> like even setInterval(interval, func) is a registration of a `func` as a handler for an event "each time interval passed" :)

[11:20:51] <Guest24> deniska: Right, but in this case, it is the redis process itself (not the nodejs redis binding library) offering a pub/sub mechanism to which my nodejs process via its own redis-client lib subscribes, correct?

[13:25:28] <piou> That's like removing the cover of a book, it loses meaning. The same words spoken by two persons dressed differently can have very different interpretations because their appearance provides context to the words.

[13:27:12] <mrig> Original thought is what counts.
[13:27:20] <piou> death916: it's actually very interesting to study cover changes and identify why they did so. Sometimes it's because the original one was not fit for the time (ex: showing something that would be considered racist today), sometimes it's because the market has shifted, these are interesting
[13:27:27] <mrig> time does funny things with that if the language is not adequate.
[13:27:42] <death916> thats true piou the reason can be very telling
[13:27:45] <piou> It may not be as interesting to you as the content of the book, but it's not meaningless
[13:28:28] <mrig> Leather bound books with the title branded on are of course the most convincing spell books.
[13:28:38] <flareon> piou: The unoriginal design of most sites currently tell you more about the industry as a whole and not much about the particular company itself.

[13:31:06] <piou> Then you get to how they actually differ from mainstream. Because even if we probably have a generic image of "bland company website" and probably share the same one, it's interesting to see where these websites decided to change things because that shows what they value
[13:31:44] <piou> And sometimes they really just take the first template and don't change a thing, and that has meaning too, be it only that they don't know much about how web design works

[13:35:26] <deniska> the density of information feels refreshing :)

[13:36:02] <flareon> mrig: It does clear the workflow.

[13:36:50] <piou> flareon: I'm not arguing that it's the breaking news of the year, simply that by ignoring design you are dismissing some information. It's not without consequence. If you're ok with these consequences, good for you, I'm just saying I'm not.

[13:38:08] <piou> But I tend to be annoyed by people dismissing things under the "meaningless" flag because generally it means that not enough thought has been given as to why things are that way and the meaningful bits can be very subtle but not less important.
[13:38:13] <flareon> piou: It is without consequence. In fact, it's like removing a bias. Earlier, I would have thunk that the company is unreliable because their site is ugly. But maybe there content *is* good and just the site is ugly. In my terminal, I can read them without thinking about that.
[13:38:47] <flareon> s/there/their/
[13:39:09] <piou> flareon: you're free to choose what you want to focus on, but if not seing their style changes your behaviour then it is definitely not without consequence :)
[13:39:17] <flareon> piou: The point is that I can browse more sites for reading on my Elinks than on my Firefox because I am not disgusted by that.
[13:40:17] <piou> And that's a wonderful thing. Just not one I would consider because I like to have as much information as I can.
[13:41:11] <flareon> piou: It does change my behaviour but it only distorts it. Imagine, if we literally cannot *see* the race of a person, don't you think our prejudices would be rendered meaningless if that happens. I want to have little bias while shopping for content.
[13:41:36] <piou> flareon: in some cases it distorts it, in some cases it enhances it, you can't know before knowing the style.
[13:42:45] <flareon> piou: It's always a distortion. I have surfed enough web and I can say that the quality of the design of a site is not a very reliable indicator of the quality of the content. They are very orthogonal.

[13:43:48] <piou> flareon: at that point I'm not sure what you're arguing for, we've agreed that style has consequences, so it matters (clearly it matters enough for you to try text-only browsers), and you've expressed that you feel better without it and I've expressed that I don't. From that point on it's just you ranting about how you personnaly dislike the styles, which alright, you're certainly free to dislike
[13:43:54] <piou> them. There's just really nothing more to discuss.
[13:44:08] <piou> So I'm going to cut it short rather than keep repeating myself.
[13:44:59] <flareon> piou: There is nothing more to discuss other than finally stating the fact that any information you get from the design of a website is so trivial that it's absolutely useless. I think you would agree.
[13:45:10] <piou> Not at all.
[13:45:18] <piou> I do think you'd have a nice experience by talking to web designers and maybe opening up to the subtlties of their craft would change your view on the matter, but I'm not ther to convince you of anything.

[16:11:44] <peteyboy1> pyzozord, in relation to yesterday, which of the 700 million global state options do you use?
[16:11:45] <pyzozord> I don't understand how are they so complacent
[16:12:21] <pyzozord> peteyboy1: absolutely depends on the company, but you need to know redux, that's kind of the standard default
[16:12:36] <peteyboy1> it's the only one i have used
[16:13:21] <peteyboy1> pyzozord, but, when i get some data and i want to dispatch it. can i manipulate the data and then just dispatch the finished product or do i have to dispatch the raw data and manipulate it in the reducer before setting it in the state?
[16:13:55] <peteyboy1> of course, how i used it until now, is just how you use useState. you manipulate the data in the function or wherever and you set the state, but of course, redux is different
[16:14:25] <pyzozord> peteyboy1: hmm, redux sagas are popular, of course making best friends with react hooks is important, I also heard about immer and mobx but never really used them
[16:14:49] <pyzozord> peteyboy1: mostly i learn whatever is used in the company in the first week or month

[16:16:58] <peteyboy1> i really only used in order not to have to pass props and props through component and components
[16:17:12] <peteyboy1> used it*
[16:17:45] <pyzozord> peteyboy1: that's called "prop drilling" and you can use react context to avoid that, it's a better tool for this problem then global state like redux
[16:17:48] <peteyboy1> but i used it just like useState, as in, i only had one case (set)

[16:18:36] <pyzozord> peteyboy1: ok well i think in the "modern react" (lol) a lot of the state is just handled with React.useState, I use it much much more than any global state like redux nowadays
[16:18:55] <peteyboy1> pyzozord, i read context has a problem with unnecessary rerendering and that it's not really designed to "dispatch", but only get the state
[16:20:12] <peteyboy1> i use useState when i know i won't to have prop drill (i'm aware of the terms' existence, i just never remember to use it), with the exception of passing to a component that is returned inside a map loop
[16:20:13] <pyzozord> peteyboy1: I'm not sure what is that remark about rerendering, must be some specific case. I general you will run into rerendering problems anyway and you need to solve them
[16:22:01] <pyzozord> peteyboy1: regarding react context "dispatch", you can put functions in your context and then you can "get state" from context where state is the functions and you can call those functions, it's pretty normal to do that
[16:22:36] <pyzozord> peteyboy1: but I don't really use react context all that often, usually say once per module where an app has 10-20 modules

[16:26:19] <pyzozord> peteyboy1: in general if you haven't already check out egghead.io, that's where I started. It was well worth the money. However I think they increasted the price something like 200% since four-five years ago when I was learning frontend
[16:26:33] <peteyboy1> pyzozord, in general, if a project grows, redux deals with it better than context though?
[16:27:26] <pyzozord> peteyboy1: I don't think you can compare them like this, those are apples and oranges, they have different function

[16:28:09] <peteyboy1> pyzozord, i imagined they have a similar function, with redux simply having more tools. if i'm not mistaken it's based on context too
[16:30:20] <pyzozord> peteyboy1: they have different properties and features. Redux is global, it has entire concept of reducers and actions. It is meant as global shared state. React context can be applied only to part of the component tree, it's more local, it doesn't have those elaborate state conepts like actions or reducers. It's simply a state shared only for a subtree
[16:30:53] <peteyboy1> only for a subtree, ok...
[16:30:55] <pyzozord> you can of course create a global context and then it will kind of compete with redux, and then you just need to decide what goes where

[16:34:08] <pyzozord> peteyboy1: but I guess the best advice I can give you - it doesn't really matter all that much. It's a matter of taste. Redux enforces more context and structures, React.context is easier, faster, lighter, less opinionated. And you just end up doing whatever more senior developers in the team say is the thing they expect
[16:34:19] <Matt|home> ... how am i having trouble with this..
[16:34:22] <peteyboy1> ok, for now i think i'll keep redux in the portfolio project, what i will do though is introduce cases where necessary. and for future projects i'll look into what i need a bit better

[16:35:45] <pyzozord> peteyboy1: one way to think about it is redux is global state, react.context is just shortcut to avoid prop drilling. Always use the simplest tool for the job
[16:37:00] <pyzozord> peteyboy1: sorry not the simplest, I mean "tool with complexity adequate to the complexity of the problem".

[19:23:08] <pyzozord> I can solve sudokus in javascript, I think that my strongest cs skill so far

[20:08:13] <mrig> Hum, is instigate or initiate better to describe the action of a token that sets a sub process on its way?
[20:08:24] <paulo_> is the number of rotations supplied?
[20:08:36] <paulo_> in this case, r = 4
[20:08:37] <pyzozord> paulo_: no, that's the point
[20:08:49] <pyzozord> paulo_: otherwise you can unrotate it
[20:09:05] <mrig> instigate perhaps, initiate would be setting up I suppose.
[20:09:16] <paulo_> you can't unrotate it without increasing the time to O(n)
[20:10:13] <piou> pyzozord: then finding the "true" start of the array can be done in O(log n), then regular binary search adjusting for array rotation is also O(log n) (it's just a play on indexes to map between your array and the un-rotated one) so the combination is O(log n)

[20:14:34] <piou> paulo_: it's almost a regular binary search. In broad strike I'd look up the first element (4 in my example array), then take one at the middle (6), since it's bigger than 4 you look in the right half, pick the middle of that (2), it's smaller so you look in the lower half, and (1) is the only remaining element so it's your "true" start

[20:24:26] <piou> pyzozord: just thought about it but if you find the true start then you don't even need to play on indexes, you can consider each half a sorted array and do a regular binary search on the correct half, decided by your knowledge of the boundary

[23:42:55] <pyzozord> I've been just whining that even though I know the solution it is taking me already 2.5h to implementing
[23:43:30] <beaky> nice im also fighting for days implementing loops in agda
[23:43:40] <beaky> its been 1 week and im still stuck from the beginning

[23:45:30] <pyzozord> programming languages for mathematical proofs
[23:45:59] <pyzozord> i think it doesn't get much more theoretical and sciency than that
[23:48:18] <dan01> Ehh
[23:48:25] <dan01> I have a string array
[23:48:44] <dan01> And I want to join all elements with a + except the last
[23:49:08] <GeDaMo> Which language?
[23:49:14] <dan01> can I do this somehow via the procedural .foreach way? As opposed to the traditional for(int i = 0....
[23:49:20] <dan01> GeDaMo: JavaScript
[23:49:32] <GeDaMo> Does JS have array slicing?
[23:49:41] <dan01> thought of that! No :(
[23:49:53] <pyzozord> deniska: array.split(0, array.length-1).join(',')
[23:49:58] <pyzozord> dan01: ^
[23:50:04] <dan01> pyzozord: thanks!
[23:50:30] <pyzozord> dan01: sorry that's not split, that's "slice"

[23:50:49] <dan01> oh so it does have slice
[23:50:54] <dan01> Sorry I was wrong
[23:50:59] <pyzozord> yeah it does
[23:51:19] <dan01> I thought of it in Go tersm like array[4:5] but yeah, that's not the only way to do it
[23:51:25] <dan01> thanks you both!

[23:52:23] <pyzozord> dan01: check out GeDaMo's link. You will see there many other useful array functions
[23:52:44] <dan01> Will sure do
[23:53:04] <InPhase> pyzozord: Did you notice the word "binary" is not anywhere in the problem statement?
[23:53:47] <pyzozord> InPhase: yeah it's not, but it's from the context, it's one of the problems in chapter "template 1" of the "Binary Search" training card

[23:54:26] <InPhase> pyzozord: But log base 2 is not the only log.  And this problem was contrived to be harder than usual when you split into two regions.
[23:54:43] <pyzozord> i think binary search is the right way to go about it, it's just those directions left right, negative positive, just too many dimentions to consider for me
[23:55:23] <InPhase> pyzozord: It would be worth looking at a trinary search example on paper.
[23:55:44] <pyzozord> i have never heard that term
[23:55:59] <InPhase> Because it's usually a stupid idea.  Because usually you don't have data like this.  ;)

[23:56:46] <pyzozord> InPhase: is this "stupid problems require stupid solutions" strategy?
[23:56:52] <InPhase> pyzozord: But algorithmically you should look at it as two datapoints two unknowns.  That's not solvable.  Three datapoints two unknowns, that's solvable at each stage.
[23:57:26] <InPhase> I guess I did not express that well.  Generally two datapoints two unknowns is solvable.
[23:58:17] <InPhase> But what I mean is there's this one extra degree of freedom introduced.  And you can fix it by simply introducing one more datapoint.  This is a generalized principle, but applied here it just means break it up by one more division.
[23:58:59] <InPhase> You could do 4 also if you love powers of two, but 3 is easier to do on paper.
[23:59:26] <pyzozord> ooh
[23:59:55] <pyzozord> hmm I did not think of that
