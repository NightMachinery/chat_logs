[14:21:35] <flatcap> morning all
[14:23:15] <gour> morning
[14:24:02] <gahr> hi all
[14:25:34] <flatcap> hi gour 
[14:25:36] <flatcap> hi gahr 
[14:26:22] <gahr> hehe
[14:26:50] * gour spent short time with opensuse/tw/btrfs - now back on debian/sid/xfs ðŸ˜„
[14:27:57] * gahr always happy on freebsd/ufs :D
[14:28:06] <flatcap> which part of the former triple didn't you like?
[14:28:53] <gour> flatcap: mostly btrfs, but i also prefer debian's simplicity, the fact that one does not need extra repos to enable
[14:28:58] * flatcap is happy with fedora/35/btrfs
[14:29:22] <gour> lastly, tumbleweed does not differ much in regard to admin overhead to sid
[14:29:49] <gour> i simply do not trust btrfs...doping regular backups and my data is on raid-1
[14:30:10] * gour hopes that xfs will get more CoW-like features in the future
[14:31:54] <realguy> And one of the explaination from fedora for that move was: "Providing an easy solution to resolve when a user runs out of free space on the root or home directory"
[14:32:11] <flatcap> I really like btrfs's snapshots and COW
[14:33:13] <realguy> zfs > all
[14:33:41] <flatcap> but I seldom do anything to really stress a filesystem
[14:34:52] <realguy> same here
[14:34:57] <gour> realguy: i was playing with freebsd/pcbsd in the past - yes, zfs is great
[14:35:31] <gour> gahr: isn't ufs kind of slow? never tried hammerfs...that could be interesting
[14:38:30] <gahr> gour: honestly, I never really cared :) 
[14:38:46] <realguy> The only downside with zfs is RAM consumption, but I don't have to pay the bill :)
[14:38:52] <gahr> filesystems are like printers to me: the most I stay away, the better I am
[14:39:05] <gahr> zfs and RAM is a bit of a myth, I have read
[14:39:22] <realguy> yes and no
[14:40:37] <realguy> you're right if you pool is small (< 50TB) and it highly depends on write modes.
[14:41:37] <gahr> I see
[14:41:52] <gahr> I have a different measure of "small" :D
[14:42:07] <realguy> but anyway I totaly aggree in private space it don't realy matter what fs to choose. 
[14:46:40] <gour> ðŸ˜„
[14:48:59] <murb> so in summary, no trust for hardware or software. :-)

[15:03:25] <jindraj> any tip what 
[15:03:57] <jindraj> â€¦ what mimetype should I use for file encrypted by openssl? the file content is already base64 encoded.

[15:58:40] <gahr> application/data ?
[15:58:57] <gahr> sorry I meant application/octet-stream
[15:59:36] <gahr> not sure if you can find a better match here https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml
[16:00:46] <mgedmin> if you have an openssl-encrypted file lying around you can try to run file --mime on it
[16:01:15] <mgedmin> but IIRC openssl encryption doesn't add any headers or metadata, so I'm sure you'll get a generic application/octet-stream out of it
[16:02:19] <jindraj> gahr: thanks, perhaps the best idea. I was looking for some text/* but there's no reason. 
[16:02:51] <mgedmin> wait, I forgot about the base64
[16:03:10] <mgedmin> file will probably think it's just text/plain
[16:09:03] <gahr> oh I understood it the other way around: I thought it would be encrypt(base64(text)) but you say it's base64(encrypt(text)) ?
[16:11:09] <jindraj> gahr: yep. it's encrpyted and base64'd. which isn't necessary when I'm thiking about it, since I also use Content-Transfer-Encoding quoted printableâ€¦
[16:13:14] <jindraj> mgedmin: well i use previews in neomutt for text/plain n pager. so it doesn't make sense to have text/plain there. It also dones't make sense to have it C-T-E: quoted printable. I should remove the final encoding to qp and change C-T-E to base64. also change the mime-type to application/octet-stream as gahr suggestd. 
[16:14:07] <gahr> +1
[16:17:06] <jindraj> thank you both :)

[17:07:33] <dcpurton> named-mailboxes seems to have two slightly orthogonal functions

[17:08:54] <dcpurton> but it also marks a mailbox to be checked for new mail

[17:53:34] <dcpurton> another random question. Does anyone ever use Windows Mail App?
[17:54:39] <dcpurton> One of my Colleagues can not read, delete or archive my PGP signed emails. :)
[17:55:01] <dcpurton> I don't care so much that he can't delete or archive - that's just good for a laugh
[17:55:36] <dcpurton> But I'd prefer it if they could be read. Want to make sure there isn't a problem with what I'm sending
[17:55:55] <dcpurton> rather than just buggy Microsoft software
[17:56:15] <flatcap> weird
[17:59:07] <gahr> he can't read a pgp-signed email?
[17:59:11] <gahr> or he can't verify it?
[17:59:16] <dcpurton> can't read
[17:59:22] <dcpurton> empty body
[17:59:30] <gahr> can you send one to me?

[18:01:29] <flatcap> :-)
[18:01:40] <olebra> occasionally (like for instance right now), neomutt refuses to quit with the error message Â«Unable to write notmuch://?query=tag:inbox&limit=300Â», any ideas of how to deal with this?
[18:01:53] <olebra> i presume it's really a notmuch issue, but anyway :)
[18:03:13] <dcpurton> I sent two - one text/plain and one multipart/alternative
[18:03:22] <dcpurton> my colleague has problems with both
[18:06:28] <flatcap> I often test by sending to a temp email service. this one allows you to send/receive and crucially inspect the raw email: https://www.guerrillamail.com/
[18:07:10] <gahr> does your colleague have an up-to-date public key of yours?
[18:07:18] <gahr> I get Warning: The key used to create the signature expired at: Wed  3 Feb 03:43:16 2021
[18:07:42] <gahr> maybe windows mail is not showing mails in this case?
[18:08:53] <dcpurton> no Windows Mail has no sort of support for PGP at all
[18:09:08] <dcpurton> but it should still *display* the email
[18:09:22] <dcpurton> expired key?
[18:09:42] <dcpurton> that's weird
[18:11:39] <dcpurton> my keyring tells me it doesn't expire until 2023-01-31
[18:12:11] <flatcap> ah, but have you pushed that to a keyserver?
[18:12:33] <dcpurton> I would think so
[18:14:41] <dcpurton> https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0x372B1A897B76B70D
[18:16:12] <dcpurton> marvel at my web of trustâ€¦
[18:16:29] <flatcap> :-)
[18:18:12] <dcpurton> It used to be the case that Outlook Express died if you sent it pgp/mime signed email
[18:18:29] <dcpurton> but that was a loooong time ago and I haven't seen any other mailer not be able to read until now
[18:20:17] <dcpurton> typically Microsoft mailers think that multipart/signed is always S/MIME
[18:20:45] <dcpurton> even if the header contains protocol="application/pgp-signature"
[18:21:41] <dcpurton> but they still display the email fine, just can't verify signature. This goes for Outlook on every platform I've tested
[18:23:05] *** Joins: jjf (~jjf@user/jjf)
[18:23:24] <dcpurton> though there was one really weird bug with Outlook under android. If you send it PGP signed text/plain then reply from the Android app, the signed email is magically converted to raw HTML
[18:23:36] <dcpurton> and you can't read it any moreâ€¦
[18:24:19] <dcpurton> doesn't happen if you send it signed multipart/alternative mail

[20:18:33] <gahr> flatcap: re log rotation and mutt_buffer_expand_path
[20:18:55] <gahr> do you think debug_file="+/foo.log" is a valid use case?
[20:19:30] <flatcap> nah, that seems crazy
[20:19:39] <gahr> yeah
[20:19:51] <gahr> I think perhaps we could expand a bit less?
[20:20:42] <gahr> I remember we had a function to expand only ~.. perhaps I remember wrong
[20:22:58] <gahr> mutt_path_canon
[20:23:38] <flatcap> ah yes
[20:24:42] <gahr> I think I'll use that
[20:25:04] <flatcap> at some point, I'll have to resurrect my path API: https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt-old#neomutt-2021-02-05=
[20:26:32] <gahr> This branch is 1433 commits ahead, 33 commits behind readme. 
[20:26:33] <gahr> good luck :)
[20:26:46] <gahr> oh, readme, not master
[20:27:17] <flatcap> hehe, it's thousands of commits behind master
[20:28:18] <flatcap> the ideas were good, but the implementation overwhelmed me at the time :-)
