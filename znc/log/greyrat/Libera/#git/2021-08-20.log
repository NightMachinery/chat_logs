[01:01:42] <Fernando-Basso> Are there "official" git documentation on writing proper commit messages? What I see is people random opinions in posts all over the web (some very sensible, true).

[01:04:53] <Fernando-Basso> It is hard to explain, argue and have an educated conversation about a subject with people who do not know about that subject.
[01:05:14] <dodo> Fernando-Basso: which problem are you actually trying to solve?
[01:05:32] <Fernando-Basso> "Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge."
[01:06:00] <Fernando-Basso> I see that all the time. I hope I myself don't do it as much as I seem to watch other people doing it...
[01:06:36] <dodo> if proper commit messages have no purpose other than being proper commit messages.. they're a waste of time
[01:06:55] <Fernando-Basso> dodo: I am trying to convince people that commit messages matter. That keeping a repo organized, clean, informational, semantic, etc. helps. Helps troubleshooting problems, finding historical stuff, and makes everyone happier.
[01:07:20] <Fernando-Basso> dodo: Then commit messages could be like "first commit", "second commit".
[01:07:25] <dodo> wait, are your commits not linked to a ticket system?
[01:07:30] <Fernando-Basso> Proper commit messages do have a purpose.
[01:07:47] <Fernando-Basso> That is not the point if they are linked or not, I would say.
[01:08:03] <dodo> it certainly is important
[01:08:12] <Fernando-Basso> Git (and other similar tools) exist apart from ticketing systems.

[01:27:14] <ELFrederich> osse, okay... I think one of two fixes will work.  Either remove the asterisk and let "java" be the first thing on the line which makes it the built-in pattern... or putting a dot between * and java which makes "*.java" the pattern

[05:21:21] <joe_atx> Hi there, anyone have any ideas on this beginner issue? I am trying to clone a git repo. I am using WLS (windows linux subsystem) as well as a proxy server. I have configured ssh to use the proxy and my identity configuration from ~/.ssh/config successfully. I tested the setup using "ssh -vvv -T GLNC" the output is as expected: Welcome to GitLab,
[05:21:22] <joe_atx> @username!
[05:21:25] *** Quits: reset (~reset@user/reset) (Quit: reset)
[05:21:42] <joe_atx> The problem I'm having is that when i try to "git clone git@git.labs.myserv.com:mygitrepo.git", git always fails with "Disallowed command".
[05:22:44] <imMute> sounds like @username doesn't have permissions to clone that repo

[05:31:48] <imMute> do you have an SSH command configured for that host  or something?
[05:33:33] <joe_atx> yeah i use GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh -vvv -T GLNC" git clone git@git.labs.myserv.com:custom-code/codelib.git
[05:33:52] <imMute> what is -T?
[05:34:06] <joe_atx> ignore terminal env
[05:35:16] <imMute> and GLNC?
[05:35:59] <joe_atx> that's my .ssh/config host
[05:36:12] <joe_atx> Host GLNC
[05:36:13] <joe_atx>         IdentitiesOnly yes
[05:36:13] <joe_atx>         IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
[05:36:14] <joe_atx>         Hostname 10.1.41.175

[05:36:15] <joe_atx>         User git
[05:37:59] <imMute> my guess is that the GLNC is causing "git@git.labs.myserv.com:custom-code/codelib.git" to be considered a command the SSH server is supposed to run
[05:38:03] <imMute> (or the other way around)

[05:40:31] <imMute> that's probably what it was then.  and now you can drop the whole GIT_SSH_COMMAND part
[05:40:45] <joe_atx> thank you so much. i've been beating my head on this thing for hours trying to figure out what was going on

[21:36:59] <imMute> ah I see.  yeah, that's something I'd get behind.
[21:42:53] <infogulch> i'm looking at `git commit --fixup=reword:<commit>`, does it still require an autosquash+force push to affect the historical commit messages when the commits have already made it to origin's master? I'm just not clear the mechanics
[21:45:14] <imMute> infogulch: 'git commit --fixup' just adds another commit that you need to rebase (with --autosquash) in order to affect the history.
[21:45:25] <imMute> so if the commit you're fixing up is already merged to master, you're probably too late
[21:46:07] <imMute> (and all rebase --autosquash does is notice that fixup commit, move it to the proper location in the action script thingy and mark it as fixup instead of commit)

[21:59:15] <baltazar> realies: if it was introduced in the last commit, you can just amend it, otherwise you can do an interactive rebase I guess
[21:59:41] <realies> i think it's a few commits back

[22:02:30] <infogulch> realies: an interactive rebase might look like `git rebase -i <commit-where-you-accidentally-added-the-file>`, change "pick" to "edit", then remove the file, `git commit --amend`, `git rebase --continue`
[22:02:32] <baltazar> realies: tl;dr, you use `git rebase -i <bad-commit>`, then at the prompt you change `pick <bad-commit>` to `edit <bad-commit>`, make your changes, and finally `git rebase --continue`

[22:38:21] <imMute> realies: you need to put in the commit just *before* the one you want to modify.  or use 'git rebase -i <sha>~'   ie, add a tilde

[22:39:51] <realies> how should I remove the file when I'm Stopped at ae24566?
[22:40:08] <realies> git reset HEAD~1 and recommit the changes without the file?
[22:40:55] <ikke> Do you want to remove the file, or remove the changes to the file?:
[22:41:17] <realies> remove the file
[22:41:36] <ikke> git rm --cached <filename>
[22:41:45] <ikke> leave out --cached if you don't want to keep it in your working tree
[22:43:46] <realies> awesome, thanks!
