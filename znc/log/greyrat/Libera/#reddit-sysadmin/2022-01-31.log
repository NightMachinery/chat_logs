[00:03:16] <Bru^> about $100
[00:03:18] <Bru^> not bad 
[00:04:37] <Hunterkll> i just buy mine new
[00:04:40] <Hunterkll> $250-350 not bad
[00:04:52] <Hunterkll> for a 24" 1ms response panel 
[00:04:59] <Hunterkll> if you want really big, look at tv's 
[00:05:07] <Hunterkll> 42" 1920x1080 for $300 can be had
[00:05:17] <Hunterkll> one of my monitors is that - a sharp i bought for $300 in 2015 
[00:06:00] <CptLuxx> but who wants full hd in 2022?
[00:06:01] <CptLuxx> :p
[00:06:12] <Hunterkll> I assume you can do much btter :P
[00:06:26] <Hunterkll> when I got my 55" it was like $500 could get you a 55" (I got a $1k model, but it was from a giveaweay) 4K
[00:06:58] <Hunterkll> almost all my games go on it and it's my main non-gaming monitor now, the 24" 1080 1ms panel I use for FPS's though

[07:29:11] <Cl0udNinja> (fs shares)
[07:29:28] <LXGHTNXNG> does the file server have enough dram to hold the working set for a one-day test of running the configs off a ramdisk?
[07:30:07] <LXGHTNXNG> if that improves performance, SSDs would too, to a lesser extent, but without the issue of shutdowns deleting the whole set

[09:34:56] <Hunterkll> and yea, in our case, cisco would definitely have been more cost efficient than our brocade/palo setup....
[09:35:33] <Hunterkll> but we had a person at the time with a personal vendetta against cisco :P 
[09:35:41] <Hunterkll> even though he only had cisco certifications.... what a moron 
[09:36:08] <Hunterkll> our side of the house went all in on brocade, but now we're unifying on juniper across the board and tossing the still in warranty brocade gear out the window, practically....
[09:36:54] <epony> cisco certifies morons
[09:37:05] <epony> that's well known
[09:37:08] <Hunterkll> Eh, higher level cisco certs do actually mean shit 
[09:37:17] <Hunterkll> lower level well, i could have gotten those as a highschool course 
[09:37:36] <Hunterkll> CCIE/CCDE mean something absolutely, the rest... eh
[09:37:38] <epony> you can't just start as a moron and not end up with a moron clearance at the end
[09:37:44] <Hunterkll> oh
[09:37:51] <Hunterkll> he only had like, CCNA shit 
[09:37:57] <LXGHTNXNG> you can if you demoron
[09:38:11] <epony> indulgency papers are cheaper
[09:38:29] <Hunterkll> CCIE you actually have to go through panels and do shit 
[09:38:35] <Hunterkll> not just take a test 
[09:38:54] <LXGHTNXNG> is ccna a prerequisite for ccie
[09:39:07] <epony> so he hated the certs cause he realised he'd be cheated to pay up above basic moronic certification
[09:39:11] <bloody> gnight

[09:39:24] <epony> like paying
[09:39:29] <Hunterkll> epony: no, his personal vendetta was because cisco sold directly to a customer when he was working on a contract, instead of us selling the hardware to the customer 
[09:39:34] * LXGHTNXNG considers going through all of those certs from various different vendors
[09:39:46] <Hunterkll> even though the profit from that resale would have been a blip in the contract overhead 
[09:39:57] <SirSceptalot> <epony> you can't just start as a moron and not end up with a moron clearance at the end
[09:40:05] <SirSceptalot> that's my goal!
[09:40:24] <Hunterkll> LXGHTNXNG: CCIE is something you'd look at many years down the road
[09:40:28] <Hunterkll> it's not for the faint of heart 
[09:40:30] <epony> make it a field goal
[09:40:34] <LXGHTNXNG> frick
[09:41:03] <Hunterkll> LXGHTNXNG: unless you want to sit before a panel of cisco engineers while they're tearing apart your design and you have to defend design decisions while going deep into technical aspects of why you made specific routing/configuration choices, etc 
[09:41:32] <Hunterkll> LXGHTNXNG: it's an 8-hour, in-person hands-on lab
[09:41:41] <Hunterkll> and not a lab scenario that has a correct answer you can study for
[09:41:46] <epony> normal people just go to University, stupid motherfuckers get a couple of certificates printed on toilet paper and claim instakarma and quantum superiority
[09:41:47] <Hunterkll> it's "here's the pieces, build this"
[09:42:04] <LXGHTNXNG> I'll give it a shot once I have a more stable basis to build on
[09:42:18] <epony> the point is, you only get "sisquo" branded pieces
[09:42:32] <epony> and you have to then convince your foKCing customers it's worth it
[09:42:39] <Hunterkll> Though, CCIE is pretty much a license to print money/ask for decent base salary 
[09:42:41] <LXGHTNXNG> i thought you thought libera was fake epony
[09:42:43] <Hunterkll> any other cisco cert isn't

[09:43:02] <LXGHTNXNG> oh godddd
[09:43:28] <epony> it's just an IRC rename.. like many before that
[09:43:36] <Hunterkll> you go hog in to CCIE if you want to work doing large-scale F500+ network design/architecture, Tier-1/Tier-2 internet backbone design/management, etc 
[09:44:05] <epony> yeah, the f500 don't care about their money, they want the "best"
[09:44:25] <JollyRgrs> epony: INCORRECT
[09:44:27] <LXGHTNXNG> I just want to have done all of the certs, seen all of the sausage factories
[09:44:27] <Hunterkll> I'm using F500 as the type of scale of what CCIE engineers deal with 
[09:44:27] <JollyRgrs> trust me on this

[09:45:40] <Hunterkll> epony: the problem with not buying W10 ent licenses is that it's crippling their internal teams and costing them more money overall then if they'd just buy it

[09:45:48] <Hunterkll> they're using W10 Pro instead

[10:04:53] <Hunterkll> just through a firewall between the vlans 
[10:05:02] <epony> well, that's a convenience, modern tooling etc, we'll all have it eventually
[10:05:16] <epony> just getting prematurely smart switches etc is just a bit too much for personal use at home
[10:05:25] <Hunterkll> like, i'm sure as hell not setting up a vlan for "classified workstations" and "unclassified workstations" on the s ame router
[10:05:25] <JollyRgrs> ?
[10:05:47] <Hunterkll> epony: consumer routers do it these days without telling you, letting you set up guest SSIDs t hat don't have access to the rest of your network
[10:05:56] <sd> 10<g​eneraal eric™> that be like driving a van saying free candy
[10:06:06] <JollyRgrs> epony: um... i fail to see where you think that no one needs a smart switch/vlans at home. sure many/most don't... but there's definitely some good reasons for having such set up like that
[10:06:16] <Hunterkll> some even have the isolated IOT functinoality these days 
[10:06:24] <Hunterkll> so you've got consumers us ing 3 VLANs without even knowing what a VLAN is
[10:06:30] <JollyRgrs> ^^ lol
[10:06:40] <JollyRgrs> but nah, that's too much for a home user... what a waste
[10:06:46] <epony> maybe, I just haven't found the need for VLAN and smart switches yet
[10:06:50] <Hunterkll> hell, you light that up on comcasts network and they flip you over to a routed /60 instad of a /64 for ipv6 
[10:07:01] <Hunterkll> epony: just because you don't, doesn't mean it doesn't exist 
[10:07:07] <JollyRgrs> epony: if all you got is your laptop, phone, and nintendo switch on your wifi... then yeah, prob don't need nothing
[10:07:08] <epony> of course
[10:07:18] <epony> wired ;-)
[10:07:22] <Hunterkll> I mean, I've got internet facing servers here and in other sites/hosts outside of the house that consulting clients access/use 
[10:07:25] <epony> what wifi, are you insane?
[10:07:32] <JollyRgrs> oh boy
[10:07:35] <epony> it's 2005 here
[10:07:36] <Hunterkll> but those have to have holes punched through to talk to my regular server stuff in some ways too 
[10:07:37] <Hunterkll> so 
[10:07:38] <JollyRgrs> you one of those?
[10:07:39] <Hunterkll> *shrug*
[10:07:48] <Hunterkll> JollyRgrs: this your first time?
[10:07:49] <Hunterkll> :P
[10:07:52] <JollyRgrs> even if i was 100% wired, i'd still want my IoT on a different vlan
[10:08:01] <Hunterkll> JollyRgrs: he's talking airgap networks
[10:08:04] <epony> no focking IoT ;-)
[10:08:13] <Hunterkll> which is impossible, unless you're buying multiple internet connections for your house :P
[10:08:17] <JollyRgrs> i thought we were just talking vlans at home
[10:08:27] * JollyRgrs goes back to playing forza
[10:08:31] <Hunterkll> lol
[10:08:32] <epony> well the VLAN is smart switch thingie
[10:08:39] <Hunterkll> not necessarily
[10:08:40] <epony> otherwise it's just shared medium
[10:08:46] <Hunterkll> vlan tags can carry well on dumb switches 
[10:08:50] <Hunterkll> and only the router really has to care 
[10:08:59] <Hunterkll> to decode/appropriately handle the tagged frames
[10:09:10] <Hunterkll> which, can be a dumb cheap PC 
[10:09:27] <Hunterkll> Catch me like ~12-13 years ago I was using pfSense with such a setup
[10:09:29] <epony> that's what works ;-) PCs
[10:09:39] <epony> minus the Sense
[10:10:00] <Hunterkll> I want gigabit line-rate NAT + IPsec tunnels + routing + intervlan routing + ACLs in a 5W power envelope
[10:10:05] <Hunterkll> got a solution for me that is PC based?
[10:10:14] <epony> that's for kids, grown up boys use the OS without a PHP GUI
[10:10:33] <Hunterkll> epony: at one point my router was a SPARCclassic with a QFE card in it ;) 
[10:10:34] <epony> s/5W/50W/g yes
[10:10:36] <layer8> Hunterkll meant: "I want gigabit line-rate NAT + IPsec tunnels + routing + intervlan routing + ACLs in a 50W power envelope"
[10:11:05] *** Joins: Seirdy (~Seirdy@sourcehut/user/seirdy)
[10:11:18] <epony> and we can drop the gigabit thing for internet, the world average is ~50 Mbps for residential
[10:11:21] <Hunterkll> yea, for 5W you need dedicated hardware / ASIC / offload kit that isn't CPU based/running 
[10:11:32] <Hunterkll> right, i'm talking about what i'm using/want right now.....
[10:11:56] <Hunterkll> or, theroetically, drop it to 150mbit, similar otherwise requirements, so I can run it off a DC power source on a boat.....

[10:12:28] <epony> :-)
[10:12:44] <epony> solid shit
[10:13:08] <Hunterkll> epony: early 2000s, around 2003 or so, we moved away from @Home internet, and I set up a P4 as a router .... for our 56k modem... shared by like 3-4 people 
[10:13:27] <Hunterkll> eventually we got an EVDO based verizon aircard, and set up a P3 laptop as a router for that..... 2mbit down woohoo!
[10:13:43] <Hunterkll> then finally got DSL .....
[10:13:50] <Hunterkll> eventually the local cable co started doing internet 
[10:13:54] <Hunterkll> and been with them ever since
[10:14:03] <epony> so roughly 5 to 50 Mbps boost ;-) with GPON, is still 2x faster internally with a 20 year old 100 Mbps LAN
[10:14:38] <Hunterkll> oh for sure
[10:14:47] <epony> I was having work dial me in 2000-2004
[10:14:51] <Hunterkll> no point in upgrading the hardware if you don't need to if you're not worried about exploitation of it 
[10:15:05] <epony> and prior to that.. unlimited 33K6
[10:15:25] <Hunterkll> Miss the days of uncapping cable modems :D

[10:19:00] <epony> since 10 GE is a bit too much heat and cost yet
[10:19:02] <Hunterkll> *shrug* kick it till it breaks unless you've outgrown it, is what I say 
[10:19:11] <epony> exactly
[10:19:48] <Hunterkll> I mean, I've got customer data here, but i've taken steps to protect against what could happen from using some outdated hardware (VLANs,  firewalls, etc)

[11:02:55] <JollyRgrs> nobyk: i think it's just a case of deez
[11:03:05] <Hunterkll> epony: QDOS wasn't quite like that, and it wasn't a company, so get yo facts straight :P
[11:03:13] * nobyk sigh
[11:03:17] <nobyk> JollyRgrs: deez what?
[11:03:21] <Hunterkll> lol
[11:03:22] <xe0n> NUTZ
[11:03:33] <nobyk> WOOP GOT EM
[11:03:38] * nobyk coughs
[11:03:39] <JollyRgrs> lol
[11:03:39] <epony> yo whatever, I'm not the WIN/DOS and AAPL/DOS fan here ;-)
[11:03:42] <Hunterkll> epony: QDOS was some dude in california who's side project MS bought for a steal :P
[11:03:48] <JollyRgrs> nobyk: you forgot to turn your head
[11:03:49] <Hunterkll> who ran a standard PC repair shop
[11:03:54] <Hunterkll> not a CP/M porting company 
[11:03:55] <epony> I know just enough of WIN/DOS to be dangerous
[11:03:58] <Hunterkll>  or reimplementing 
[11:04:04] <epony> since like 1981
[11:04:11] <Hunterkll> $10k straight up 
[11:04:14] <Hunterkll> and the rest is history 
[11:04:20] <nobyk> And I'm out of fucking orange juice
[11:04:26] <Hunterkll> nobyk: shit
[11:04:30] <Hunterkll> nobyk: got any honey/tea?
[11:04:38] <JollyRgrs> man, i want some oj now
[11:04:40] <epony> just use some pee ;-)
[11:04:46] <JollyRgrs> like the good stuff, not the "from concentrate" crap
[11:04:59] <epony> beer >> juice
[11:05:00] <JollyRgrs> epony: bonus, you'll be covid protected, too
[11:05:03] <Hunterkll> epony: gotta mix more real fact into your trolls, so it throws people off who've watched a documentary or two 
[11:05:04] <Hunterkll> lol
[11:05:36] <Hunterkll> <LXGHTNXNG> If I develop an operating system based on BSD, I am not looking for TOG certification. I am looking to comply with UNIX V7, but not to certify to being UNIX V7.
[11:05:41] <Hunterkll> wtf is that supposed to mean?
[11:05:49] <Hunterkll> UNIX V7 is positively fucking ancient 
[11:05:54] <LXGHTNXNG> https://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/register/xv7m0.htm
[11:05:55] <Hunterkll> like, PDP-11 ancient
[11:05:57] <nobyk> Yeah I got tea
[11:06:02] <LXGHTNXNG> It means that, not V7 RU.
[11:06:06] <nobyk> though I'm drinking watered down lemon juice now
[11:06:06] <nobyk> lol
[11:06:10] <nobyk> That's good too
[11:06:19] <nobyk> and I can taste it so.. that's good right?
[11:06:19] <LXGHTNXNG> now my ears are burning wtf
[11:06:19] <nobyk> lol
[11:06:20] <epony> I'm a user of DOS in the 1-3 years and CP/M too for a brief.. so did not insist it was fun or worked well, but it did the minimal set of tasks for the micro-computers at the time (8bit and 16bit PCs)
[11:06:29] <Hunterkll> LXGHTNXNG: look at the bottom of the page 
[11:06:34] <Hunterkll> LXGHTNXNG: test suites 
[11:06:37] <epony> so I kind of know what I'm talking about but don't care to set the record straight your end
[11:06:54] * LXGHTNXNG nods
[11:06:55] <LXGHTNXNG> i saw that.
[11:06:58] <Hunterkll> epony: lol, i've read the actual original sales contract of QDOS to microsoft that then became MS-DOS/PC-DOS 
[11:07:08] <LXGHTNXNG> Ignore me, i am a dirtbag
[11:07:09] <Hunterkll> that's public 
[11:07:22] <epony> yeah, I used IBM PC-DOS, teh MSFT shit was discarded here.
[11:07:25] <nobyk> Let me know when you guys are done measuring dicks
[11:07:26] <nobyk> jeez
[11:07:26] <Hunterkll> epony: so is the fact that NT evolved from the OS/2 2.0 codebase under the stewardship of dave cutler and became NT 3.1 
[11:07:39] <epony> I don't know much about NT though
[11:07:45] <epony> that's where our paths separate
[11:07:46] <xe0n> os2 4 lyf
[11:07:47] <Hunterkll> epony: it started as NT-OS/2 
[11:07:58] <Hunterkll> after 2.0, MS went down the NT route, IBM went down the OS/2 route 
[11:07:59] <epony> cause UNIX was coming down to the PCs and I disposed of WIN/DOS immediately
[11:08:01] <xe0n> i renewed my sub the other day lol
[11:08:07] <Hunterkll> xe0n: shit i got a reminder too
[11:08:08] <nobyk> It's like you're arguing who's the most dinosaur
[11:08:20] <LXGHTNXNG> what is even reactos
[11:08:23] <Hunterkll> xe0n: mine expires this week
[11:08:45] <Hunterkll> LXGHTNXNG: clean-room implementation of windows (the NT-based, not the 9x/DOS based)
[11:09:08] * LXGHTNXNG nods
[11:09:18] <epony> I got some brief use of WFW3 and some NT4 and W95-WXP but that's just supporting others
[11:09:27] <xe0n> nt was originally going to have program manager as it's interface, confirmed by david plummer 
[11:09:33] <Hunterkll> xe0n: it did 
[11:09:35] <LXGHTNXNG> The "what is even" was more of an expression of confusion than not knowing the words for it
[11:09:37] <Hunterkll> xe0n: up until NT 4 
[11:09:55] <Hunterkll> xe0n: NT4 stole the Win95 UI, but used progman for the previous 3 releases 
[11:09:56] <xe0n> https://www.youtube.com/c/DavesGarage < good stuff
[11:10:09] <xe0n> sorry not program manager, ummm os2s thing
[11:10:10] *** Joins: Bideford (Bideford@dsl-217-155-169-214.zen.co.uk)
[11:10:11] <xe0n> workspace shell
[11:10:11] <LXGHTNXNG> whose idea was this desktop/taskbar paradigm anyway?
[11:10:14] <xe0n> whatever it was called
[11:10:15] <epony> the point still stands, AAPL was never a UNIX company, never was NEXT either
[11:10:25] <epony> and never was MSFT eitehr
[11:10:37] <epony> they're just resellers and commercial re-implementers
[11:10:47] <xe0n> presentation manager*
[11:10:49] <xe0n> was that it
[11:10:52] <LXGHTNXNG> yes
[11:11:14] <Hunterkll> epony: Apple dabbled in and out of unix several times in its history, majorly at points
[11:11:18] <Hunterkll> OS X was it's final settling ground 
[11:11:24] <epony> so, AAPL can get certified in 2003 after stealing (well borrowing) FreeBSD userland and adding a couple of POSIX shims but it's not UNIX internally and never was
[11:11:25] <Hunterkll> MSFT was a *huge* unix company in the early days 
[11:11:28] <xe0n> umm apple did have unix on its classic machines
[11:11:33] <Hunterkll> yea, A/UX 
[11:11:35] <LXGHTNXNG> A/Ux
[11:11:40] <Hunterkll> a direct AT&T descendant, even 
[11:11:53] <Hunterkll> was a major selling point of theirs for quite a while
[11:12:04] <epony> that's BS, MSFT was a reseller of UNIX under a different license name XENIX but never made anything UNIX related just consumer shitware
[11:12:19] <epony> HUGE as in, DOES NOT EXIST on the record of UNIX history
[11:12:23] <Hunterkll> they weren't a reseller....
[11:12:28] <epony> resellers don't count
[11:12:33] <epony> of course they were
[11:12:49] <epony> licensee of AT&T to sell it with applications of their own
[11:12:52] <Hunterkll> they licensed it and developed it from AT&T into a usable, commercial product, including the ports they did 
[11:12:54] <epony> which it flopped
[11:13:04] <Hunterkll> they were for a while one of the largest u nix vendors
[11:13:05] <epony> usable like shit
[11:13:15] <LXGHTNXNG> do I smell XENIX?
[11:13:24] <Hunterkll> absolutely
[11:13:25] <epony> nope
[11:13:41] <Hunterkll> fun fact: it wasn't until about '96 / '97 that microsoft switched to their own email software off of internally developed/maintained unix
[11:13:51] <Hunterkll> and windows 95's final disk images were mastered on xenix servers
[11:14:10] <epony> the largest UNIX vendors were Digital, HP and IBM and later SUN to some small markets and ORACLE of all non-UNIX resellers
[11:14:28] <epony> MSFT maintained nothing about UNIX
[11:14:30] <Hunterkll> Microsoft actually licensed xenix out to resellers
[11:14:42] <epony> it has no finger in UNIX, it's a downstream commercial failure called XENIX
[11:14:45] <Hunterkll> they did all the porting work, CDC's version was MSFT's porting work 
[11:15:38] <epony> not an expert on MSFT and AAPL history.. they are pretty insignificant UNIX-wise
[11:16:06] <Hunterkll> ah here it is
[11:16:14] <Hunterkll> SCO joined microsoft on the Xenix work in 1982
[11:16:23] <LXGHTNXNG> Control Data?
[11:16:31] <Hunterkll> but microsoft was already shipping/supporting Xenix in 1981 
[11:16:41] <Hunterkll> seems SCO failed and had to ride on MS's work
[11:16:42] <Hunterkll> lol
[11:16:46] <epony> the significant UNIX companies are AT&T (Bell Labs / Lucent / Alcatel), Digital (DEC) / HP, IBM and to some smaller extent SUN
[11:17:06] <epony> the rest are just resellers and patent trolls
[11:17:14] <Hunterkll> huh
[11:17:16] <epony> yeah
[11:17:20] <Hunterkll> I didn't know microsoft sold a port of Xenix for the Lisa 2 
[11:17:36] <LXGHTNXNG> Aren't Control Data currently an HR outsourcing company?
[11:17:38] <Hunterkll> SCO was the reseller/distributor 
[11:17:41] <epony> MSFT and AAPL have a history together ;-)
[11:17:51] <epony> like a couple of divorces
[11:18:10] <Hunterkll> epony: i'm well aware of the office saga and GUI lawsuits/threats
[11:18:24] <epony> but you can brush up on UNIX someday ;-)
[11:18:31] <Hunterkll> epony: or you could
[11:18:32] <Hunterkll> ;)
[11:18:36] <epony> it's called BSD and SYSV for a reason
[11:19:13] <Hunterkll> epony: back in the day, MS was hawking DOS for consumers, and Xenix for multitasking "real" users
[11:19:24] <LXGHTNXNG> why ;-;
[11:19:29] <LXGHTNXNG> artificial market seg
[11:19:34] <epony> yeah, but it failed cause it had no hardware, remember
[11:19:41] <epony> MSFT and AAPL are NOT hardware companies
[11:19:43] <Hunterkll> ... no hardware?
[11:19:44] <epony> so they suck
[11:19:47] <epony> yeah, none
[11:19:48] <Hunterkll> we're not talking about apple at all
[11:19:59] <Hunterkll> intel's System 86 machines were MS Xenix 
[11:20:06] <Hunterkll> Xenix sold on a LOT of shit
[11:20:26] <epony> that's kind of unimportant, is it?
[11:20:33] <Hunterkll> you said 'no hardware'
[11:20:43] <Hunterkll> but MS's Xenix ran on a shitload of hardware and architectures
[11:20:48] <epony> since IBM licensed direct from AT&T and got their own AIX
[11:21:02] <epony> instead of sticking with MSFT resales
[11:21:04] <Hunterkll> MS did too, and created Xenix 
[11:21:12] <Hunterkll> that's how Xenix was born, MS bought an AT&T license
[11:21:21] <LXGHTNXNG> I just want a computer that's reasonably secure, reasonably efficient, treats me like an adult, and lets me play like a child
[11:21:25] <Hunterkll> they bowed out of the market when AT&T started selling their own shit after the ma bell breaekup
[11:21:47] <epony> AT&T was selling HW too
[11:22:15] <epony> MSFT -> not, they banked on IBM for that and the spawned the clones market
[11:22:17] *** ChanServ sets mode: +o xe0n
[11:22:24] <LXGHTNXNG> ... ?!
[11:22:36] <Hunterkll> erm
[11:22:43] <Hunterkll> MSFT's xenix was on a lot of non-IBM machines....
[11:22:44] <Hunterkll> like CDC 
[11:23:02] <Hunterkll> but yea, MS's internal email system was run on in-house maintained/developed unix until '97 lol
[11:23:02] <epony> and AAPL was struggling like crazy with their PC designs which were, just not very meaningful after their initial 8bit models
[11:23:07] <Hunterkll> apparently on m68k based systems 
[11:23:10] * LXGHTNXNG goes puppy eyes at xe0n.. "that gun isn't aimed at me, is it?"
[11:23:24] <epony> while IBM was selling lots of machines to big businness and consumers alike
[11:23:30] <Hunterkll> MS was known for its extensive unix usage and sales in the 80s 
[11:23:33] <epony> so controlled the software market that way
[11:24:07] <Hunterkll> Microsoft introduced file locking to xenix
[11:24:08] <epony> the m68k were.. popular with "workstation" wannabee companies that flopped
[11:24:08] <Hunterkll> lol
[11:24:29] <Hunterkll> oh yea, and I note you keep glossing over SGI too...
[11:25:14] <epony> if you're desperately lookin for some innovation comming from MSFT and AAPL, there ain't any such..
[11:25:19] <epony> oh yeah SGI were trendy
[11:25:30] <Hunterkll> I dunno, file locking and semaphores? Though DEC was pretty heady in the SMP space 
[11:25:31] <epony> had their own UNIX license too
[11:26:13] <Hunterkll> i've got a lot of DEC and MSFT research papers in my basement, lol
[11:26:35] <Hunterkll> xe0n: renewed my OS/2 support contract :P
[11:27:17] <LXGHTNXNG> Ecomstation?
[11:27:23] <Hunterkll> naw
[11:27:26] <Hunterkll> that shit got no future
[11:27:29] <Hunterkll> arcanoae.com
[11:27:38] <Hunterkll> they doing new kernel releases/fixes/drivers/etc
[11:27:39] <LXGHTNXNG> oh
[11:27:43] <Hunterkll> soon native UEFI-only (no bios) boot
[11:27:44] <Hunterkll> etc
[11:28:18] <epony> you know just SGI was never popular..
[11:28:31] <epony> so I keep forgetting it existed (not significant to the UNIX history)
[11:28:36] <Hunterkll> except they were, extremely
[11:28:44] <Hunterkll> find a TV weather station that didn't have an indigo or two 
[11:29:02] <Hunterkll> i'm sure there's a few, but it was hugely popular for doing green screen overlays and weather animations
[11:29:04] <Hunterkll> among many other things
[11:29:10] <Hunterkll> and, you know, OpenGL 
[11:29:13] <LXGHTNXNG> one founded after indigos were no more?
[11:29:18] <epony> it's basically just https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Unix that matters at this point
[11:29:43] <Hunterkll> and SGI was huge in the supercomputer sector for a fair amount of time with IRIX 
[11:29:48] <Hunterkll>  Origin 2000 systems especially
[11:29:52] <epony> so the mini-computers like VAX were the first 32bit machines
[11:29:58] <epony> that got UNIX ported to them
[11:30:16] <epony> and that's where BSD picks up and makes it into HP workstations and bails out
[11:30:48] <epony> and 386BSD picks up and gives you modern FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD
[11:31:02] <Hunterkll> MS's Xenix is actually *very* relevant to unix history, if you'd take a look back...
[11:31:14] <epony> not really
[11:31:24] <LXGHTNXNG> i just want to be a cute animal in a scrappy server room
[11:31:26] <epony> nothing came from it that got into AT&T releases
[11:31:35] <Hunterkll> erm
[11:31:45] <LXGHTNXNG> because i'm too broken to be a human
[11:31:47] <epony> all that AT&T did was taken then by BSD and propagated back
[11:31:47] <Hunterkll> MS submitted a lot of code fixes/enhancements upstream to AT&T 
[11:32:16] <epony> in fact WIN/DOS did not have even TCP/IP stack up to W95 and NT4
[11:32:27] <Hunterkll> that's not exactly true
[11:32:31] *** Quits: notsponsible (~notsponsi@185.226.144.69) ()
[11:32:32] <epony> it was totally stuck in Novel land with IPX/SPX
[11:32:57] <epony> during the WFW/NT3 years
[11:32:59] <Hunterkll> 3.x had TCP/IP 
[11:33:05] <Hunterkll> WFW definitely had TCP/IP
[11:33:08] <Hunterkll> it's how I used it 
[11:33:10] <epony> "external software"
[11:33:23] <epony> winsock extra / trumpet winsock replacement
[11:33:38] <epony> and guess where it took it from?
[11:33:52] <Hunterkll> NT's TCP stack was BSD based
[11:33:56] <epony> definitely from the BSD TCP/IP stack where all otehr system got it ;-)
[11:34:17] <epony> yeah, and MSFT also at one point tried to pull in the Korn shell from a downstream reimplementer again
[11:34:34] <Hunterkll> either way, saying that 9x / NT was the first windows with TCP
[11:34:37] <Hunterkll> is neigh on disengenous 
[11:34:44] <xe0n> lolll
[11:34:46] <Hunterkll> especially since a lot of times protocol support was shipped with the NIC 
[11:34:46] <epony> they have a history of "borrowing" shit from re-implementers that copy original work from other companies
[11:34:55] <Hunterkll> my 3.xx machine, install nic software, have tcp/ip
[11:35:10] <epony> probably came with the NIC driver bundle
[11:35:24] <Hunterkll> epony: except, you're totally *ignoring* Xenix history, given it was the most major successful commercial bundle after UNIX V7 
[11:35:33] <epony> WIN/DOS needed a winsock driver to work with the Internet
[11:35:43] <epony> which was an extra application you start
[11:35:50] <Hunterkll> no.... it wasn't 
[11:35:52] <Hunterkll> but still
[11:36:02] <epony> of course, XENIX is ignored, it brought nothing to UNIX
[11:36:04] <Hunterkll> epony: guess what, TCP/IP support in Windows 11 is still... a separate driver that connects to the networking subsystem
[11:36:08] <Hunterkll> epony: except, it did.
[11:36:10] <epony> neither did AAPL, nor SGI ;-)
[11:36:19] <Hunterkll> Semaphores. File locking. Those are the two major ones everyone knows
[11:37:29] <Hunterkll> well detailed in the Intel System 86 manuals
[11:38:18] <epony> the red ones are business vendors (licensees)  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Unix_history-simple.svg/1280px-Unix_history-simple.svg.png
[11:38:49] <Hunterkll> i'm quite familiar with this chart
[11:39:02] <Hunterkll> SCO Xenix is also Microsoft Xenix (until '89 i thi nk?)
[11:39:03] <epony> ok, don't see the SGI there
[11:39:06] <Hunterkll> SCO was the reseller
[11:39:25] <epony> so you can scratch that
[11:39:38] <Hunterkll> not every infographic on wikipedia records everything....
[11:39:54] <epony> and MSFT is a patent troll like SCO and NOVEL
[11:40:07] <Hunterkll> SCO wasn't a patent troll at the time
[11:40:22] <epony> it sure was
[11:40:26] <Hunterkll> but SGI's u nix was SVR3 + BSD + SGI's magic sauce and filesystems 
[11:40:44] <epony> you call that downstream consumer applications
[11:40:55] <Hunterkll> ... no?
[11:41:02] <Hunterkll> SGI machines were definitely not consumer targeted
[11:41:22] <Hunterkll> in fact, I nevr really mentioned it
[11:41:32] <epony> applications are consumers of the operating system
[11:42:08] <epony> consumer electronics is something else, it's like game consoles and appliances and handhelds
[11:42:20] <Hunterkll> epony: a lot of SGI's magic sauce though, was ported to the linux kernel 
[11:42:24] <Hunterkll> in various aspects
[11:42:25] <nobyk> there's a halo tv show?
[11:42:33] <Hunterkll> nobyk: oh god please no
[11:43:17] <Hunterkll> epony: in fact, it's SGI's work that led to hugely multiprocessor SMP systems in the UNIX/linux ecosystems
[11:43:30] <epony> so you see UNIX is this yellow thing that stems from AT&T into the BSD (system development) and SYS3/SYSV (commercialisation)
[11:43:35] <nobyk> oh yeah
[11:43:52] <epony> and the BSD goes on to become NET and then FreeBSD and NetBSD and OpenBSD
[11:43:53] <LXGHTNXNG> ;-;
[11:44:01] <Hunterkll> epony: no, the yellow/red just shows open/closed source 
[11:44:07] <epony> yeah
[11:44:11] <Hunterkll> and yes, i will say that BSD has deviated far enough 
[11:44:15] <Hunterkll> that it's no longer unix
[11:44:16] <epony> that's how "system development" happened
[11:44:30] <Hunterkll> it's unix-like, for sure
[11:44:46] <Hunterkll> and look at OpenServer 10.x 
[11:44:58] <Hunterkll> that's BSD based, but it's partially closed source, and it's still a partial AT&T descendant 
[11:45:12] <Hunterkll> it's Xinuos's sucessor to the SCO codebase they inherited

[11:45:35] *** Quits: redstarcomrade (uid99592@user/redstarcomrade) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[11:46:04] <epony> so, majority of the commercial systems take SYSIII and SYSV, which are in itself a BSD VM/32bit and BSD NET/runlevels
[11:46:18] <Hunterkll> not.... quite accurate....
[11:46:20] <Hunterkll> but anyway

[11:46:24] <Hunterkll> back to xenix 
[11:46:31] <Hunterkll> it really did have a huge impact 
[11:46:41] <epony> not in the history of UNIX
[11:46:47] <epony> just on the history of MSFT ;-)
[11:46:57] <Hunterkll> your own self-professed jesus chart shows taht Xenix 3.0 directly fed the development of AIX 
[11:49:05] <epony> which is a downstream of SYS3/SYSV from AT&T
[11:49:19] <Hunterkll> epony: AT&T had to fight microsoft to get SYSV compat in Xenix since they didn't want to do it - https://books.google.com/books?id=7y4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA20&lpg=PA20&dq=microsoft+AT%26T+1987+patch+xenix&source=bl&ots=1lBKVccgA3&sig=ACfU3U3ga0C8TtXya25Oro2EqC4wfJh4uQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiUmMntxtv1AhVXkIkEHcGLChAQ6AF6BAglEAM#v=onepage&q=microsoft%20AT%26T%201987%20patch%20xenix&f=false
[11:49:49] <epony> AT&T got the development back and forth with BSD from CSRG, nothing going on there with downstream licensees, who did their own work
[11:49:53] *** Joins: notsponsible (~notsponsi@185.226.144.69)
[11:50:05] <Hunterkll> MS at least submitted UNIX work back up to AT&T 
[11:50:25] <epony> yes, MSFT is the stubborn backward walking asshat patent troll forever, like AAPL, they both fail to even terminate lines properly
[11:50:39] <Hunterkll> .... this literally has nothing to do with patents, lol
[11:50:49] <epony> they fail at hardware and software equally ;-) and can't do system programming
[11:50:59] <epony> it has, cause you know licensing is sales
[11:51:11] <epony> and deviations is "lock-in" for sale points
[11:51:18] <epony> not for "being a UNIX developer"
[11:51:24] <Hunterkll> licensing doesn't have to involve patents, you know 
[11:51:37] <Hunterkll> and the 'deviations' is being compatible with other unix vendors who haven't adopted the new standard yet
[11:51:37] <epony> so they broung back NOTHING to UNIX, just their own doings somewhere along their history
[11:51:55] <Hunterkll> ...... yet th ey kept submitting code to AT&T that kept trickling down to all unix vendors all the way till the 90s 
[11:52:04] <epony> which is typical, since MSFT and AAPL did not invent anything
[11:52:21] <Hunterkll> yet i've already provided examples, which you're happy to ignore, i guess
[11:52:33] <epony> the are downstream commercial reimplementers of other companies work and resellers of other companies software
[11:52:40] <epony> it's nothing dude
[11:52:51] <Hunterkll> Semaphores and file locking is nothing
[11:52:52] <Hunterkll> got it
[11:53:00] <epony> file locking and semaphores are basically BS things in kernel space do not exist
[11:53:18] <Hunterkll> yet, pretty damn important for applications and end users
[11:53:21] <LXGHTNXNG> why did WNT take over the world?
[11:53:29] <Hunterkll> LXGHTNXNG: IBM
[11:53:36] <Hunterkll> IBM and marketing 
[11:53:53] <epony> it didn't, IBM had PC-DOS from IBM, MSFT was just in the US
[11:53:53] <Hunterkll> at that point, everyone had an IBM compatible, so why not buy the shiny new, instead of buying a whole new computer?
[11:54:07] <Hunterkll> epony: PC-DOS was IBM's rebrand of MS-DOS as licensed to them by MS 
[11:54:16] <Hunterkll> PC-DOS is literally just rebranded MS-DOS
[11:54:20] <epony> yes, which was a bought in unoriginal work
[11:54:35] <epony> so, it's not really an invention either
[11:54:37] <Hunterkll> yes, from seattle computer works, a small repair shop, from some dude's hobby project, for $10k
[11:54:39] <Hunterkll> i never said it was
[11:54:56] <epony> who copied DRI work for CP/M
[11:55:07] <epony> which got their designs copied by IBM too
[11:55:17] <Hunterkll> though, fun fact: due to the adding of folders/heirarchal filesystem and need for Xenix compatibility, MS set the standard to \ for file path separators, but forward / still worked on dOS 2.0 and up.... and does to this day
[11:55:37] <LXGHTNXNG> why \L
[11:55:42] <LXGHTNXNG> \?
[11:55:49] <Hunterkll> it was apparenetly a huge argument at the time
[11:56:03] <epony> does not matter much, since is a commercial only issue
[11:56:23] <Hunterkll> but that dual compatibility lasts to this day
[11:56:32] <epony> file systems use / for separation and \ for escaping chars
[11:56:34] <Hunterkll> if you type /windows/system32/notepad.exe in a run dialog, it opens notepad.exe just fine 
[11:56:44] <epony> in MSFT, which is some commercial downstream
[11:56:50] <Hunterkll> no need to type C: or anything
[11:56:58] <epony> no notepad on UNIX
[11:57:06] <Hunterkll> no one was saying they were
[11:57:09] <Hunterkll> i wasn't talking to you

[11:57:42] <layer8> Title:  Why Does Windows Really Use Backslash as Path Separator? | OS/2 Museum 
[11:57:47] <Hunterkll> basically, it's IBM's fault windows doesn't use forward slash as a path separator 
[11:58:15] <DrZak> why would anybody give a shit about that anyway
[11:58:29] <Hunterkll> epony: if your windows dir is on D:, then / is D: 
[11:58:38] <Hunterkll> on windows, / is always the root install volume
[11:58:51] <epony> the first 16bit x86 PCs and before that the 8bit 6502 PCs had A: and B: floppy drives, no HDD and primitive DOS convention
[11:59:10] <LXGHTNXNG> why drive letters
[11:59:10] <epony> so DOS predates MSFT's pitch to IBM
[11:59:21] <Hunterkll> not this lineage of dos
[11:59:25] <Hunterkll> if we go by your AT&T purism 
[11:59:26] <Hunterkll> ;)
[11:59:27] <LXGHTNXNG> why not just graft everything to /?
[11:59:46] <Hunterkll> LXGHTNXNG: at that time, mount points would have been  basically incomprehensibly expensive to process for the most part
[11:59:47] <LXGHTNXNG> or, er, \, I mean

[12:00:05] <DrZak> you stick in a floppy - its a or b
[12:00:10] <Hunterkll> epony: also, none of my 6502 systems use drive letters, they use addresses or numbers to reference which floppy it is 
[12:00:11] <Hunterkll> :P
[12:00:19] <DrZak> you open system drive, is C, you open data drive, its D
[12:00:20] <DrZak> easy
[12:00:48] <epony> yeah, I was using 6502 PCs as a kid in pre-school and teletypes too, and all other large and small computers, except.. NONE XENIX, just what really worked
[12:00:54] <DrZak> using /mount/somecrap does work, but its much more annoying
[12:01:21] <Hunterkll> epony: yea, so you're basing everything on what you've seen from your perspective, not others :P
[12:01:34] <Hunterkll> well, drive letters are a carryover from CP/M 
[12:01:43] <Hunterkll> CP/M did indeed call floppy drives A and B
[12:01:43] <epony> we had AT&T and BSD UNIX, CP/M, 6502 DOS, X86 DOS..
[12:01:52] <epony> I know, I used that system
[12:01:53] <Hunterkll> epony: which 6502 DOS 
[12:01:54] *** Joins: Gaboradon (~Gaboradon@user/Gaboradon)
[12:02:05] <Hunterkll> because back then, DOS w asn't synonymous as it is 
[12:02:11] <epony> it did not have branding
[12:02:15] <DrZak> it work very well till recent times, like 2010ish, when i started to run out of drive letters on file servers

[12:03:19] <epony> it was addressing the disk controllers numbers to get the floppy controller to start and it loaded an OS and gave you a file system which is DOS
[12:03:36] <Hunterkll> right, which DOS is important here
[12:03:45] <Hunterkll> because Atari DOS is wildly different from Apple DOS, for example
[12:03:49] <epony> don't know, probably apple's it did not say anywhere

[12:12:59] <epony> ah, you had it probably from Apple original with accessories
[12:13:23] <epony> here it was "nationalised" clones produced locally with local CPUs and everything locally produced
[12:13:53] <epony> so the 8bit and 16bit PCs were clones all over the place, at schools and workplaces
[12:13:54] <Hunterkll> ah okay just checked
[12:14:06] <Hunterkll> the port is the "new style" external floppy 5.25 controller

[12:23:41] <Hunterkll> it's more - i run into so many scenarios often where
[12:23:43] <Hunterkll> i need X 
[12:23:54] <Hunterkll> X was wiped off the internet in 2007
[12:23:56] <Hunterkll> well fuck
[12:24:07] <Hunterkll> like, for data recovery, records translation, etc 
[12:24:17] <epony> it was Xfree86 in teh 90ies
[12:24:21] <Hunterkll> so i just make a repository of this shit available 
[12:24:24] <Hunterkll> lol
[12:24:28] <Hunterkll> and the 2000s too 
[12:24:31] <epony> haha
[12:24:36] <Hunterkll> though i forget when the whole drama/split happened
[12:24:45] <Hunterkll> somewhere early 2000s 
[12:24:55] <epony> I kind of did not care much, as long as graphics worked
[12:25:06] <epony> since S3 models were hit and miss in the mid-90ies
[12:25:23] <epony> and NV sucks and blows
[12:25:38] <Hunterkll> yea
[12:25:40] <Hunterkll> XOrg was 2004 
[12:25:42] <epony> Matrox was a bit proprietary at work..
[12:25:53] <epony> and Ati was fun
[12:26:16] <Hunterkll> aren't they all?
[12:26:25] <Hunterkll> I wish one of these FPGA GPU projects would take off 
[12:26:26] <epony> so between S3 and NV burn, the XF86/Xorg drama was insignificant
[12:26:40] <Hunterkll> yea, Xorg was 2004 and didn't really affect us at all
[12:26:47] <Hunterkll> we just updated packages/recompiled and it kept working the same
[12:26:50] <Hunterkll> was a straight fork 
[12:26:56] <Hunterkll> first release was basically just rebranding
[12:27:10] <Hunterkll> XF86 had that stupid licensing bullshit going on iirc 
[12:27:28] <epony> I was not tracking X that much then, was using it since 96 and expected everything to just work
[12:27:41] <Hunterkll> hahahahahaha
[12:27:52] <epony> the real problems was, why is KDE2 so slow fuck it, and Gnome3 so useless fuck taht
[12:27:53] <Hunterkll> expecting x86 X to just work 
[12:28:00] <epony> yeah ;-)
[12:28:04] <Hunterkll> gnome2 you mean 
[12:28:06] <epony> sourcery
[12:28:14] <Hunterkll> KDE 3.5 is where my love is
[12:28:19] <Hunterkll> IMO the perfect DE 
[12:28:19] <epony> yeah I used that too
[12:28:23] <LXGHTNXNG> meow
[12:28:24] <epony> after that, KDE broke
[12:28:31] <Kiernian|Work> ahhh matrox, a disgrace to the six letter that make up the word "maxtor"
[12:28:38] <Kiernian|Work> *six letters
[12:28:39] <Hunterkll> epony: https://www.trinitydesktop.org/
[12:28:42] <epony> KD4 was trial and abandon
[12:28:46] <LXGHTNXNG> my server has a Matrox G200eR2 in it
[12:28:56] <Hunterkll> epony: well, early KDE4 was shit, later it's kind of going back to the 3.5 roots 
[12:29:02] <epony> mine too but g200w
[12:29:10] <Hunterkll> epony: but trinity is a straight up modern supported fork of 3.5 
[12:29:10] <Kiernian|Work> wait, they switched from just making shitty video adapters to actually making cards, too?
[12:29:29] <Hunterkll> ....
[12:29:31] <epony> I went fluxbox and then boxless ;-)
[12:29:32] <Hunterkll> what?
[12:29:36] <epony> with dwm and cwm
[12:29:42] <Hunterkll> fluxbox is nice
[12:29:50] <LXGHTNXNG> as near as I can tell my server's Matrox is built into the management baseband
[12:29:51] <Hunterkll> i still have printed out configs of my fluxbox system from the mid 2000s
[12:30:05] <epony> yeah, flux was needed
[12:30:09] <Hunterkll> Kiernian|Work: erm, matrox ... hard drives? you smoking crack?
[12:30:16] <Hunterkll> epony: well blackbox was neigh long abandoned at that point
[12:30:18] <Hunterkll> so lol
[12:30:32] <epony> cause I gotta do work on the machines too, can't just stay in front of KDE and assume that my goals in life are complete
[12:30:37] <Kiernian|Work> maxtor hard drives, matrox used to make crappy not-quit-gpu-not-quite-splitter cards for video stuff
[12:30:38] <Hunterkll> Kiernian|Work: matrox has always been about video components 
[12:31:02] <Hunterkll> Kiernian|Work: apparently th eir first, very first prodcut, was a graphics card
[12:31:04] <Hunterkll> so....
[12:32:12] <Kiernian|Work> interesting. I only ever had experience with their garbage hardware peripherals
[12:32:16] <Hunterkll> in fact, their whole history is nothing but GPU products 
[12:32:21] <Hunterkll> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrox
[12:32:45] <Hunterkll> https://www.vogonswiki.com/index.php/Matrox
[12:32:49] <Hunterkll> would probably be a better breakdown
[12:32:54] <Kiernian|Work> like, for dual monitor setups in office desktops that only had onboard GPUs
[12:33:04] <epony> so the big drama was, KDE1 was nice looking but slower than W95, KDE2 was better looking but slower than W98, and Gnome1/2 were.. difficult to use and not very welcome
[12:33:12] <Hunterkll> oh, it was probably a matrox chip onboard, with a matrox breakout cable
[12:33:18] <Kiernian|Work> yup
[12:33:25] <Hunterkll> so matrox GPU + breakout cable
[12:33:35] <epony> so was doing X and WM from teh first load and weight problems around 1998-2000
[12:33:36] <Hunterkll> epony: i dunno, KDE 3 was the sweet spot for me on P2/3 machines

[12:35:24] <Hunterkll> it's still a work in progress before i submit patches
[12:35:37] <Hunterkll> epony: oh, did you know CDE got open sourced? and so did true blue MOTIF

[12:36:18] <Hunterkll> I want to find a copy of red hat's distro of it from back in the day but it's pretty damn hard to find 
[12:36:30] <epony> there are archives
[12:36:34] <Hunterkll> they sold a commercial version of CDE/MOTIF for linux 
[12:36:36] <epony> of all their releases
[12:36:39] <LXGHTNXNG> it's a shame oracle and fujitsu sparcs are only made in servers
[12:36:47] <Hunterkll> epony: this was a binary only, proprietary product

[12:37:52] <Hunterkll> lol
[12:38:39] *** MrJacks1n is now known as MrJackson
[12:38:50] <DrZak> tbh. i am little surprised at the state of standards here
[12:38:50] <epony> I like older claims..
[12:38:52] <DrZak> i mean
[12:38:55] <epony> from the 70ies ;-)
[12:38:59] <epony> kind of make more sense
[12:39:07] <Hunterkll> DrZak: back in the day we had standars, and porting was easy
[12:39:10] <Hunterkll> now we have 20x standards
[12:39:13] <Hunterkll> and god help you
[12:39:21] <DrZak> having one or to approaches to activity X would mean software would be safer and way WAY WAAAAAAYYYY cheaper
[12:39:24] <epony> the ones you find on books in Russian that are translations from American books
[12:39:36] <DrZak> so, it would be in business interests to force all vendors do the same thing
[12:39:40] <Hunterkll> yea here we go 
[12:39:41] <epony> and some "original" US books
[12:39:43] <Hunterkll> epony: https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2522
[12:39:47] <Hunterkll> that's what i'm talking about
[12:39:57] <Hunterkll> not just motif, but the full CDE distro
[12:40:19] <DrZak> wasnt CDR some horrible thing from slowlaris?
[12:40:28] <Hunterkll> lol
[12:40:31] <DrZak> CDE
[12:40:33] <Hunterkll> no
[12:40:40] <Hunterkll> CDE was on almost every UNIX vendor

[12:40:51] *** Joins: dirtcastle (~dirtcastl@103.43.203.227)
[12:40:52] <DrZak> right
[12:40:53] <Hunterkll> Slowlaris, that joke is as old as the x86 port of Solaris 7 (where the joke came from) 
[12:40:58] <DrZak> that was fuckin ugly
[12:41:01] <Hunterkll> no, just Common Desktop Environment
[12:41:18] <Hunterkll> MOTIF based, for UNIX and VMS 
[12:41:29] <Hunterkll> was part of the UNIX workstation standards

[12:42:00] <Hunterkll> Solaris 7 included it because it was released a year after it became standardized 
[12:42:09] <Hunterkll> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Desktop_Environment
[12:42:21] <Hunterkll> that was when Sun was still struggling to keep X out, but had to include it for compatibility 
[12:42:27] <DrZak> yea
[12:42:39] <DrZak> this is the horrible ugly thing designed by blind monkey
[12:42:53] <Hunterkll> but yea, the Slowlaris joke was two parts: The Sun Ultra 5 with IDE drives on a SPARC CPU (lol), and the x 86 port 
[12:42:58] <epony> I kind of like motif, but it has to be a bit thinner on the spacing and the scroll bars and no screen panels / pagers
[12:42:58] <Hunterkll> the x86 port was horrific 
[12:43:13] <dirtcastle> I'm thinking of running a email server in beaglebone.  In case , I'm encountering a bug or smtg and I can't keep the server up, will I lose the msgs forever ? I read abt it in google . it said the sender's email server will try to send the msg again and again for next 4 days before it quits. 
[12:43:18] <dirtcastle> how true is that
[12:43:47] <DrZak> some of these unix environment are like the memes of 'Painter dude, have you ever seen a baby - when looking at some horrible painting of child looking like an old guy'
[12:43:51] <epony> it is kind of true but the standard required 1 week to 2 weeks retry time
[12:43:55] <DrZak> environments
[12:43:59] <csws> it's up to the sender. I don't think they survive that long in exchange online
[12:44:05] <csws> but a day or two is pretty normal
[12:44:21] <epony> most emailers (MTA) loginc the periods to daily and keep it up for 14days
[12:44:30] <DrZak> dirtcastle: its usually between 1-4 days
[12:44:33] <Hunterkll> dirtcastle: all depends. ours fail on retrys after 8 hours and send an NDR (nondelivery report) to the sender 
[12:44:41] <DrZak> when people trys resend
[12:44:43] <Hunterkll> it really all depends on the remote mailservers configuration 
[12:44:49] <DrZak> Hunterkll: that is a bit too strict
[12:44:59] <Hunterkll> DrZak: we also fail hard on non-TLS etc
[12:45:07] <DrZak> o.0
[12:45:11] <epony> the relay it gets stuck must keep it up retrying for at least 7 days by standard
[12:45:24] <epony> it goes on to 14 days typically
[12:45:42] <Hunterkll> dirtcastle: tl;dr just host your mailserver somewhere not on a beaglebone black
[12:45:43] <Hunterkll> lol
[12:45:48] <epony> right
[12:46:03] <DrZak> Hunterkll: arfent your drones bitching about unable to reach somebody?
[12:46:07] <epony> the arm boards are power efficient but are kiosk hardware, not server hardware
[12:46:10] <Hunterkll> DrZak: hah
[12:46:19] <csws> well in exchange it's 2 days apparently
[12:46:24] <Hunterkll> by default
[12:46:28] <csws> yeah
[12:46:31] <DrZak> csws: you can set it to X in exchange
[12:46:33] <epony> exchange has no standards, it's useless
[12:46:35] * csws tries to imagine someone changing defaults
[12:46:37] <csws> wow
[12:46:42] <csws> your mum has no standards
[12:46:43] <Hunterkll> except everything it does is 100% standars compliant
[12:46:45] <Hunterkll> but beyond that
[12:47:05] <epony> xchange is just for internal company digpix
[12:47:10] <dirtcastle> Hunterkll , what do u mean by "ours". is that your personal server or work server. u can avoid the question if u think I'm intruding your privacy. 
[12:47:14] <csws> yeah nobody uses exchange
[12:47:15] <Hunterkll> I use sendmail as an external smarthost/relay for my exchange box 
[12:47:18] <csws> lol
[12:47:19] <Hunterkll> dirtcastle: work
[12:47:45] <Hunterkll> personal it's mostly defaults except for security hardening
[12:47:46] <Hunterkll> but yea
[12:47:48] <csws> dirtcastle, Hunterkll is running confidential top secret information through an exchange 5.5 box running on NT4 exposed to the internet
[12:47:49] <epony> just consider what drama SBS is
[12:47:53] <Hunterkll> lol
[12:48:05] <Hunterkll> epony: thank god they killed that 10 years ago
[12:48:15] <epony> it was 10 years overdue then
[12:48:21] <epony> qmail is 1998
[12:48:27] <DrZak> heh, i actually ran a project with dudes, where the users had a homebrewn plugin in Outlook, where when they wanted to send a secure mail they had to push a button, the button checked, if the domain of the recipient is in a sharepoint list, if it wasn't it created a ticket for messaging team, to add the domain to TLS enforced list on the gateway
[12:48:38] <DrZak> and only after this was done they were allowed to send the mail out
[12:48:39] <DrZak> :]
[12:48:40] <Hunterkll> epony: 2008 R2 is the last actual SBS 
[12:49:02] <epony> the email goes open and the hosting webmail monsters appear in 1998-2000 too
[12:49:02] <csws> SBS 2011
[12:49:05] <csws> best SBS
[12:49:19] <csws> it has the most secure and feature complete version of exchange: 2010
[12:49:22] <Hunterkll> which was exterminated on the same date as 2008 R2's support
[12:49:25] <epony> technically sendmail existed but..

[12:49:38] <DrZak> ugh sendmail
[12:49:41] <csws> very advanced and still industry leading IM with lync 2010!
[12:49:51] <Hunterkll> DrZak: i use sendmail as an external smarthost for my exchange box lol
[12:49:56] <Hunterkll> for in/out email paths 
[12:49:57] <DrZak> why having an easy life, if you can make it hard for yourself by an idiotic config file
[12:50:08] <epony> I can't read sendmail configs I'm too easily annoyed by such configuration file formats
[12:50:15] <LXGHTNXNG> ;-;
[12:50:16] <DrZak> its horrendous
[12:50:16] <epony> that and apache vhosts

[12:50:37] *** Joins: matrael (~matrael@PLEASEJUSTLETME.BE)
[12:50:51] <Hunterkll> oh i have a stack of scripts for dealing with sendmail 4 
[12:50:54] <DrZak> i mean, its not the 90ies anymore where you had to be careful with space, so your config file had to be as small as possible
[12:50:55] <Hunterkll> that should be my next project
[12:50:55] <epony> and generic unix conf files, at worst makefiles
[12:50:59] <Hunterkll> a public facing sendmail 4 instance
[12:51:00] <csws> epony, what's your opinion on /etc/network/interfaces?
[12:51:03] <Hunterkll> see how fast it gets popped 
[12:51:04] <csws> I reckon it's the pinnacle of configuration
[12:51:17] <epony> well, I use OpenBSD ;-)
[12:51:24] <epony> that about sums it up
[12:51:31] <Hunterkll> DrZak: yea but what people didn't do - and should have - is that the format led itself WELL to machine parsing .... GUIs should have existed, or at least CLI menu driven shit 
[12:51:43] <Hunterkll> my sendmail manuals are like 8 inches tall stacked up
[12:51:44] <Hunterkll> lol
[12:51:45] <epony> I like the BSD style configs and rc init
[12:52:01] <Hunterkll> epony: i think we can both agree, fuck systemd 
[12:52:11] <csws> tbh
[12:52:12] <epony> and interface names by driver / device without complex enumeration and dotted tagged device names
[12:52:13] <csws> I like systemd units
[12:52:15] <Hunterkll> even solaris's SMF or apple's launchd would have been a far better approach 
[12:52:18] <csws> buuuttttt
[12:52:24] <Hunterkll> which gives you the same thing as systemd u nits
[12:52:25] <dirtcastle> Hunterkll, is that really such a bad idea? I'm going to use it to host webserver , pihole , zncb, bitwarden etc. on it. just hosting stuff only. so It'll probably be connected to the internet 22hrs per day.  (2 hrs to give it some rest). If I learn enough abt email servers, can I make a reliable one with beaglebone? 
[12:52:29] <Hunterkll> without replacing PID1 and such other shit
[12:52:36] <csws> openrc does a pretty good job with simple little init scripts
[12:52:37] <haise01> Hunterkll: Solaris SMF is light years ahead 
[12:52:38] <csws> it might win my heart
[12:52:50] <epony> SYSD is just SYSV for machines
[12:52:59] <epony> but it's not cool
[12:53:04] <Hunterkll> systemd is just "lets take everything and wrap it into one"
[12:53:09] <epony> yeah
[12:53:14] <dirtcastle> csws , I didn't even understand half if things u said 🥲
[12:53:17] <epony> it's binarisation of the boot up
[12:53:18] <Hunterkll> audio? DNS resolver? fuck it, why not systemd-emacs?
[12:53:23] <epony> which is.. like commercial OS
[12:53:26] <haise01> systemd-kernel
[12:53:29] <epony> which AT&T legacy is
[12:53:35] <csws> dirtcastle, it's ok, it's all nonsense anyway
[12:53:37] <Hunterkll> except it's not
[12:53:42] <epony> so.. is in line with the enterprise runlevel bs-crapware
[12:53:58] <epony> butt.. it's a complication to teh system operator
[12:54:02] <Hunterkll> SMF config is all plaintext, AIX's boot sequence - all plaintext scripts, VMS - all plaintext (except software you're invoking), windows - even that's plaintext startup sequences!
[12:54:14] <Hunterkll> systemd however, removes a lot of that!
[12:54:17] <csws> can't wait until systemd-sshd comes along
[12:54:18] <epony> and the SysOP >>> fucking clouds
[12:54:21] <Hunterkll> and rolls a lot of shit that should be separate 
[12:54:32] <Hunterkll> into a binary mess with binary logfiles and no fucking debug paths
[12:54:42] <epony> cause it's a sysop that picks what software runs and where the systems run, not the cloud vendors
[12:54:52] <Hunterkll> fuck, windows log files and boot path are almost easier to debug than systemd at this point
[12:54:56] <Hunterkll> with the scope creep of systemd 
[12:55:07] <epony> and theen, SysD is just not the supposed improvement over SysV it should have been
[12:55:16] <LXGHTNXNG> meow
[12:55:17] <Hunterkll> scope fucking creep
[12:55:19] <epony> it's just RedHat market grab as usual, they are assholes
[12:55:20] <csws> I might actually tie a noose and end it all if netplan makes it into debian

[12:57:03] <haise01> LXGHTNXNG: its dog shit, one of many reasons why I just yolo RHEL or SuSE now
[12:57:11] <LXGHTNXNG> linux is bad anymore
[12:57:26] <epony> Suse will take over from RH

[12:57:41] <epony> HP picked it after all
[12:57:44] <csws> LXGHTNXNG, https://netplan.io/examples/ I don't mind the idea so much, yaml is pretty good but I hate editing it in the terminal
[12:57:56] <csws> plus it's annoying to remember the schema

[12:58:31] <LXGHTNXNG> this is awful

[12:58:54] <LXGHTNXNG> it's all toxic
[12:59:12] <epony> I don't recommend getting used to a system config tool like yast, sysconfig and whatever it was called in FreeBSD (sysinstall cough)
[12:59:33] <epony> they are useful as a checklist / interface reminders

[13:00:34] <LXGHTNXNG> is there some way i can licence aix to use in emulation
[13:00:38] <haise01> epony: you are absolutely right and it made hopping between distros a bit more difficult 
[13:00:56] <epony> distro hopping is nice, if you're a novice user and learning things
[13:01:18] <epony> after a while you learn there is RPM and DEB and you go, fuck that and install Arch and you're done
[13:01:34] <epony> the 90ies choice was teh same with only Slackware instead of Arch
[13:01:44] <haise01> true
[13:02:04] <epony> and 1-2 years of misery you pick Gentoo or FreeBSD and then OpenBSD and never look back

[13:03:26] <epony> yeah it rocks cause it picked the BSD RC init
[13:03:50] <epony> and it was tracking better security in the 1996-2000 time frame
[13:04:06] <epony> and before that was the do it yourself distribution of choice
[13:04:31] <epony> so is the model of BSD ideas re-seeding to the Linux distro fanbase
[13:05:14] <epony> Gentoo and Arch pick similar things, the ports and the simpler do it yourself (rolling) model of self-sustainable always fresh compile it all if you like but have packages first model
[13:05:38] <epony> that comes from teh FreeBSD ports tree
[13:05:49] <epony> and the BSD release building model in general
[13:06:06] <epony> which Linux distros provide for you as a service but don't give you the tooling to do it yourself

[13:40:56] <epony> you would think
[13:40:57] <Hunterkll> nVidia emulates GPUs on z/Series mainframes
[13:41:05] <Hunterkll> not for customer facing purposes
[13:41:08] <Hunterkll> but for R&D
[13:41:25] <epony> but the reality is.. they are open frame barebones server boards from foxconn or any other board vendor
[13:41:34] <Hunterkll> O.o
[13:41:43] <LXGHTNXNG> emulation on x86 would just be too slow, right?
[13:41:44] <Hunterkll> you have no idea what a z/Arch machine is actually like, do you?
[13:41:58] <Hunterkll> LXGHTNXNG: oh you can run software, it'll be fine, even real time, for single user small datasets
[13:41:58] <epony> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_computing#The_1980s_to_mid-1990s
[13:42:08] <LXGHTNXNG> I don't mean that
[13:42:19] <LXGHTNXNG> I mean nvidia's usage
[13:42:31] <Hunterkll> yea, they use a lot of accelerator cards
[13:42:32] <epony> also, youtube does not run on z/ANYTHING

[13:42:41] <Hunterkll> epony: no shit, it wouldn't mkae any sense to

[13:43:05] <Hunterkll> epony: youtube is an example of where scale out actually works
[13:43:47] <LXGHTNXNG> I wonder how far one can take transactional
[13:43:52] <LXGHTNXNG> on commodity hw
[13:43:55] <epony> and neither is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebras#Technology
[13:44:19] <Hunterkll> which is an entirely different use case
[13:44:21] <Hunterkll> try again
[13:44:41] <epony> I am intentionally picking use cases where z/OS does not live ;-)
[13:44:43] <Hunterkll> LXGHTNXNG: well, if you need ACID compliance, then it depends on how fast your interlinks are and how soon you need a response 
[13:45:03] <epony> it's very easy, just pick out any random server use case, no z/OS done.
[13:45:23] <Hunterkll> LXGHTNXNG: how many shards do i have to split that 1TB table over to compute, vs ..... a 10ms max response in one rack of hardware?
[13:45:37] <LXGHTNXNG> mhm
[13:45:48] <Hunterkll> or, let's go a different route
[13:45:53] <LXGHTNXNG> I can't see this ending well for anyone on commodity hw
[13:46:05] <Hunterkll> 1,000 linux VMs in one rack with full TLS acceleration and AES acceleration for back end 
[13:46:18] <Hunterkll> so that there's no CPU penalty for encrypting 
[13:46:22] <epony> you have to come out of your bank with a truck of money to pick anything from IBM, and you don't, it's government / big business level (and not for the services economy of scale, for internal use)
[13:46:26] <Hunterkll> and you get wire-speed performance 
[13:46:27] <epony> so, makes no sense
[13:46:35] <Hunterkll> that's just a $250k rack 
[13:46:43] <Hunterkll> we pay more per-rack for "commodity" hardware
[13:46:51] <Hunterkll> since we need to use wintel shit 
[13:47:06] <Hunterkll> if we could go power or z/arch we'd cut costs hard
[13:47:09] <Hunterkll> and reduce footprint
[13:47:17] <epony> your personal computers are not z/OS, and your work computers are not z/OS.. nothing you can touch and reach is z/OS or AIX.. it's nowhere
[13:47:53] <Hunterkll> ..... I flip open my work laptop and i touch z/OS and AIX... I log into some of my old employer's systems to retrieve tax data... z/OS ..... I log in to pull my old LES ... z/OS ....
[13:47:59] <epony> the POWER platform is proprietary and limited to IBMs own deployments, and it's market share and number of isntallations is very small
[13:48:08] <Hunterkll> your grandma has medicare? z/OS

[13:48:54] <Hunterkll> there's multiple 3rd party vendors
[13:48:55] <Hunterkll> in fact
[13:48:59] <Hunterkll> you can buy bare motherboards for it

[14:10:31] <epony> but it peaked in the early 90ies and the Pentium ate it
[14:10:39] <Hunterkll> oh sure
[14:10:41] <epony> and it declined in the mid-90ies
[14:10:46] <Hunterkll> we're porting that (alpha shit) to x86 
[14:10:53] <Hunterkll> well, interim stop gap to itanium 
[14:10:53] <epony> yep
[14:11:02] <Hunterkll> we got a shitload of itanium hardware stocked for the effort 
[14:11:02] <epony> that is the SOLE reason why you support it
[14:11:05] <epony> to port it
[14:11:13] <Hunterkll> but it's because VMS is going x86 
[14:11:16] <Hunterkll> that's the only re ason
[14:11:29] <Hunterkll> we actually pushed to go SPARC 
[14:11:35] <Hunterkll> but that'd have been a full re-write 
[14:11:38] <LXGHTNXNG> whewt.
[14:11:41] <Hunterkll> once VMSI took over maintenance 
[14:11:49] <Hunterkll> and we realized VMS wasn't EOL
[14:11:52] <LXGHTNXNG> Hunterkll: Who are 'we'?
[14:11:54] <Hunterkll> the customers eabout faced
[14:12:17] <Hunterkll> LXGHTNXNG: people providing services to the US government 
[14:12:44] <LXGHTNXNG> Sole traders, or a company that's a usg contractor?
[14:13:42] <epony> the point is.. there are other regions outside the US, like EU and the former non-western union countries
[14:14:00] <Hunterkll> Yep! And we provide z/OS support/programming services to the EU as well!
[14:14:06] <epony> and the only hardware that reaches these regions is, what really, and only what works
[14:14:14] <sd> 11<H​otmess> mnnnn europa
[14:14:23] <epony> so.. we get just x86 here ;-)
[14:14:32] <Hunterkll> Hell, @Hotmess is probably near an installation I have login to that's not x86 :P
[14:14:38] <epony> and the big supercomputers are hidden in institutions
[14:14:51] <epony> where your IBM clusters are
[14:15:08] <sd> 11<H​otmess> 1.3km from london gateway RN 😉
[14:15:11] <epony> but we don't have POWER8,9,10 things here
[14:15:14] <sd> 11<H​otmess> so probably
[14:15:18] <Hunterkll> @Hotmess yeeeep :P
[14:15:47] <Hunterkll> market share doesn't mean sh it
[14:16:01] <Hunterkll> in the iron leages
[14:16:08] <LXGHTNXNG> If i could get a Talos 2, I may be the only person in a couple hundred klicks with one.
[14:16:16] <sd> 11<H​otmess> capacity is usally the measure unless your company is downing in debt
[14:16:41] <Hunterkll> LXGHTNXNG: yea, just make sure all your software can compile on POWER under lin ux and/or your power distro has your packages
[14:16:58] <Hunterkll> treat it as alien land, if you were 
[14:17:40] <epony> eventually, if you could buy anything else as components and business computers
[14:17:52] <Hunterkll> which is what the Talos system is....
[14:17:58] <epony> like something from HP or Dell that had real use
[14:17:59] <LXGHTNXNG> totally alien, or only mostly alien?
[14:18:02] <Hunterkll> it's what RISC-V failed to be 
[14:18:08] <epony> you get X86 from Intel and Amd
[14:18:27] <epony> and you're doing well, cause there is a ton of software, and a lot of use for such computers
[14:18:31] <Hunterkll> LXGHTNXNG: you boot into linux with a GUI, you get the packages precompiled for your architecture, and branching out will be.... fun
[14:18:48] <Hunterkll> Gentoo will actually make it the easiest 
[14:18:48] <epony> even teh IBM servers are x86 if you're buying servers for work
[14:18:58] <haise01> wot
[14:19:00] <Hunterkll> epony: IBM doesn't sell x86 servers anymore
[14:19:02] <Hunterkll> haven't for yaers
[14:19:05] <Hunterkll> only POWRE 
[14:19:08] <epony> fuck them ;-0
[14:19:09] <Hunterkll> .... only POWER  
[14:19:15] <LXGHTNXNG> Lenovo owns IBM's x86 business now.
[14:19:20] <Hunterkll> epony: IBM offloaded x86 to Lenovo since it was unprofitiable 
[14:19:24] <epony> I mean, IBM thinkcentres are x86
[14:19:27] <Hunterkll> they're focusing on POWER and z/Arch 
[14:19:34] <Hunterkll> epony: Lenovo ThinkCentres now 
[14:19:38] <epony> yes, that
[14:19:49] <Hunterkll> IBM's out of the x86 game
[14:19:50] <Hunterkll> entirely
[14:19:57] <Hunterkll> POWER and z/Arch 
[14:20:00] <epony> there are fujitsu/siemens computers too, which are x86 agani
[14:20:13] <Hunterkll> sure, for workstations....
[14:20:14] <epony> super
[14:20:18] *** Quits: structoha (~structoha@gateway/tor-sasl/structoha) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[14:20:21] <Hunterkll> we only buy POWER fujitsu systems
[14:20:40] <haise01> TIL that Fujitsu also has POWER systems lol
[14:20:46] <LXGHTNXNG> It's so strange logging into my Lenovo x3550 M5 PC-compatible server's management baseband.
[14:20:51] <epony> workstations and servers are also sold as components and integrated solutions with many vendors of components too
[14:20:56] <Hunterkll> er, I meant SPARC
[14:20:58] <Hunterkll> not POWER
[14:21:06] <teh_f4ll3n> haise01, they don't
[14:21:08] <Hunterkll> we only buy SPARC fujitsu systems
[14:21:09] <epony> so that is the realistic market of computers, components
[14:21:13] <Hunterkll> that's what i meant
[14:21:25] <haise01> Hunterkll: ah alright
[14:21:37] <Hunterkll> too many architectures flying ar ound :P
[14:22:06] <epony> you can buy Intel and Amd CPUs in server and desktop variants, and mainboards for them, and you can get the boards and other components very affordable and from many vendors
[14:22:14] <haise01> yeah, I would probably confuse as well Hunter
[14:22:24] <epony> so.. tower and server PCs are those x86 CPU assemblies
[14:22:27] <haise01> I just keep track of RISC-V, ARM and POWER
[14:22:33] <epony> that's what HP and Dell and Lenovo do too
[14:22:41] <Hunterkll> epony: great, and that's not the target market ei care about 
[14:22:47] <epony> that's what Apple was doing too with their servers
[14:22:59] <epony> well, you're unique
[14:23:04] <Hunterkll> my XServe is POWER based 
[14:23:07] <Hunterkll> not x86 
[14:23:09] <Hunterkll> ;_
[14:23:11] <Hunterkll> ;)
[14:23:12] <epony> as your market segment is not mainstream computing
[14:23:29] <epony> you're an institutionalised service bot ;-)
[14:23:31] <Hunterkll> good
[14:23:39] <Hunterkll> then why do you keep saying that x86 is king?
[14:23:51] <epony> I mean in the after-market economy of support of legacy computer systems
[14:24:04] <lancehead> I'm going to make x69 because god told me to
[14:24:12] <haise01> x420
[14:24:14] <epony> x96 ;-)
[14:24:21] <haise01> bumping up those registers to 128 bits
[14:24:24] <lancehead> x1337
[14:24:26] <epony> is the next iteration after x86
[14:24:33] <lancehead> x8008135
[14:24:34] <haise01> ...lol
[14:24:36] <Hunterkll> epony: I can support an out of contract 10 year old IBM mainframe easier than I can a 15 year old PC 
[14:24:46] <teh_f4ll3n> x69420
[14:24:49] <epony> you know, x86 design was done in 1976
[14:25:00] <Hunterkll> it's all extensions of 4004 
[14:25:04] <Hunterkll> we can move on from that
[14:25:05] <epony> so, it's 10 years from design to commercialisation
[14:25:27] <epony> which makes it a 45 year PLATFORM
[14:25:29] <lancehead> x255.255.255.0
[14:25:40] <lancehead> advanced maths right there
[14:25:46] <Hunterkll> nah, ticker starts from sillicon release
[14:25:51] <Hunterkll> which still makes it the oldest
[14:25:56] <epony> you can bet the 64bit machines will be with us for quite some time
[14:25:59] <Hunterkll> but we have to start from the 4004 ship date
[14:26:15] <epony> despite the 256 and 512 bit extensions (instruction groups)
[14:26:24] <haise01> lancehead: x255.255.255.255
[14:26:28] <epony> "design of the platform"
[14:26:36] <teh_f4ll3n> can we just migrate to quantum computing now? I really want AMD Schrodinger 7 42080
[14:26:42] <epony> so it takes about 10 years
[14:26:49] <epony> to commercialise it
[14:26:49] <Hunterkll> epony: seems that we've settled on bitness as how we handle ram so let's just go with that
[14:26:57] <lancehead> haise01: x/16
[14:27:00] <Hunterkll> epony: because otherwise GPUs are 128 bit computers
[14:27:09] <haise01> lancehead: x/4
[14:27:12] <lancehead> D:
[14:27:26] <epony> the next iteration is to make it 64bit in the addressing too
[14:27:36] <Hunterkll> ethat's what....
[14:27:38] <Hunterkll> dear god
[14:27:40] <Hunterkll> seriously?
[14:27:44] <epony> and look for 256 and 512 bit memory buses
[14:27:53] <Hunterkll> which already exist
[14:28:03] <epony> yeah, just not in general computers
[14:28:15] <LXGHTNXNG> i cannot find a price for Fujitsu M12-1
[14:28:15] <epony> (as in not in your desk PC)
[14:28:23] <epony> yet™
[14:28:43] <epony> and we'll have a 64bit v2 epoch
[14:28:46] <haise01> LXGHTNXNG: we can start with your kidney
[14:28:46] <epony> which starts about now
[14:28:50] <Hunterkll> LXGHTNXNG: you won't
[14:28:56] <LXGHTNXNG> why not
[14:28:57] <Hunterkll> LXGHTNXNG: i can get you a quote though 
[14:29:02] <lancehead> haise01: I volunteer mine as tribute 
[14:29:10] <LXGHTNXNG> oh good god
[14:29:11] <lancehead> don't need 2 
[14:29:17] <lancehead> I'll keep the change if you don't mind 
[14:29:22] <haise01> lol
[14:29:26] <LXGHTNXNG> is there no way for a new customer to contact inside sales
[14:29:28] <Hunterkll> LXGHTNXNG: $20k to start, then we talk adding CPUs, ram, or drives....
[14:29:31] <epony> with nested virtualisation and encrypted instruction execution instruction and data and cache lines and memory lines
[14:29:43] <LXGHTNXNG> $20k for a full barebones?... ;-;
[14:29:44] <epony> up to the storage
[14:29:49] <epony> and networking
[14:29:49] <LXGHTNXNG> or, rather, empty
[14:29:50] <haise01> Hunterkll: $20k for barebones ? holy shit lol
[14:29:55] <epony> for "crypto" zones
[14:29:56] <lancehead> jesus christ 
[14:30:04] <Hunterkll> LXGHTNXNG: best i can do is 6 cores, only 6, no addins, with 1TB ram, for $19k 
[14:30:18] *** Quits: cation (cation@user/cation) (Quit: Leaving)
[14:30:29] <epony> that and 4-64TB of system RAM
[14:30:33] <epony> are the next stages
[14:30:41] <LXGHTNXNG> is that the minimum amount of RAM?
[14:30:44] <Hunterkll> i said 1TB system ram 
[14:30:51] <epony> that's already a thing
[14:31:09] <teh_f4ll3n> The wecommended amount of dedotated WAM?
[14:31:12] <epony> up to 4TB systems on x86 are now commercially available
[14:31:19] <Hunterkll> LXGHTNXNG: i'm sure we can hack at it, but that'd be a special order too
[14:31:21] <SirSceptalot> LUNC HOUR
[14:31:21] <lancehead> Oh no teh_f4ll3n, I had repressed that memory 
[14:31:28] *** Quits: SirSceptalot (~SirScepta@user/sirsceptalot) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[14:31:42] <Hunterkll> LXGHTNXNG: going up might be cheaper than going down
[14:31:48] <Hunterkll> i'd have to log into the pricing tool to check
[14:31:57] <epony> hahaha ;-)
[14:31:58] <LXGHTNXNG> you have to log into the pricing tool?
[14:32:15] <lancehead> teh_f4ll3n, you should look up minecon highlights at some point. That entire event is the deepest level of cringiness ever 
[14:32:19] <lancehead> It's fucking hilarious 
[14:32:20] <epony> log into my dealer who gives me x86 discounts ;-)
[14:32:40] <Hunterkll> LXGHTNXNG: let's put it this way
[14:32:43] <epony> but I am IBM fanatic otherwise, because work and big computers
[14:32:46] <Hunterkll> LXGHTNXNG: this is a damn good deal https://www.ebay.com/itm/124412770655
[14:33:10] <Hunterkll> 2TB ram, M12-2S, $23k 
[14:33:20] <LXGHTNXNG> holy fuck.
[14:33:47] <LXGHTNXNG> that's like, 2 years of my disability pension. Without working two jobs unto burnout I will never buy that.
[14:34:10] <epony> I like more boars from Asus/Gateway and Supermicro/Tyan and Sapphire/MSI
[14:34:24] <epony> and chips from Amd cause more cores and better pricing
[14:34:36] <Hunterkll> LXGHTNXNG: wait till you hear about the 48TB ram options.....
[14:34:37] <epony> and Intel can fix their pricing first
[14:34:55] <Hunterkll> LXGHTNXNG: oh, and 256 * 16 VMs
[14:35:05] <Hunterkll> 4096 VMs
[14:35:13] <epony> so technically even Dell and HP and Lenovo are too expensive for real people
[14:35:27] <haise01> Hunterkll: when you say VMs ? you refer to LDOMs ?
[14:35:33] <epony> they are servicing businesses and resellers
[14:35:45] <LXGHTNXNG> And for nigh off 40,000 canadian pesos, what all can the computer do?
[14:35:47] <Hunterkll> haise01: no, 16 partitions, 256 VMs inside partiton 
[14:35:54] <epony> that's just another name of "Threads"
[14:36:01] <haise01> Hunterkll: oh gotcha
[14:36:07] <Hunterkll> I said nothing about threads or anything else
[14:36:16] <epony> with "slightly better" control (instruction support)
[14:36:24] <Hunterkll> didn't even go there yet
[14:36:29] <epony> which 64bit v2 will give out "as is"
[14:36:35] <Hunterkll> uhuh
[14:36:44] <epony> it's not in very high demand so far
[14:36:46] <Hunterkll> nice of you to jump so far ahead you're irrelevent 
[14:36:56] <lancehead> Say, epony, is your name pronounced "eponni" or "e-pony" ? Because one would worry me
[14:37:05] <Hunterkll> LXGHTNXNG: a lot, or not much, because it depends on your use case
[14:37:10] <epony> it's ebony ;-)
[14:37:21] <epony> but keep it a secret
[14:37:25] <Hunterkll> lol
[14:37:26] <lancehead> okay okay deal 
[14:37:29] <LXGHTNXNG> Can I stuff a graphics card and a Soundblaster into it, install X11, Gnome and Firefox, and watch a bit of Youtube?
[14:37:39] <lancehead> I will keep anyone's secrets. Unless they're a brony 
[14:37:51] <LXGHTNXNG> What's wrong with bronies D:
[14:37:52] <epony> cause, we like big butts
[14:37:55] <Hunterkll> uh so graphics card, sure.... if you run linux on it, which would defeat the point, unless you run it in a dom ... 
[14:37:55] <teh_f4ll3n> or a furry
[14:38:05] <lancehead> we don't talk about those, teh_f4ll3n

[14:38:46] <LXGHTNXNG> Hunterkll: Let's say I'm not squeamish about re-porting OSes that have killed their SPARC support.
[14:39:00] <Hunterkll> good fucking luck
[14:39:17] <Hunterkll> better to get a modern x86_64 and run s olaris on it with nvidia cards
[14:39:23] <Hunterkll> so you can use the solaris x86 nvidia drivers
[14:39:41] <teh_f4ll3n> haha... nVidia cards
[14:39:48] <epony> nvidia muahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
[14:39:49] <teh_f4ll3n> good luck getting those
[14:39:51] <Hunterkll> for solaris, that's what you want 
[14:39:59] <Hunterkll> for solaris supported ones, they're all in stock
[14:40:02] <epony> failed to acquire RAM, I mean Arm
[14:40:13] <epony> nananavidia goes mad
[14:40:13] <lancehead> Just download some Arm
[14:40:17] <teh_f4ll3n> try leg
[14:40:21] <Hunterkll> now AMD cards
[14:40:27] <Hunterkll> i can't fucking find any of the S ones i want
[14:40:32] <Hunterkll> that have SRIOV support
[14:40:44] <teh_f4ll3n> Hunterkll, they're sold out
[14:40:44] <epony> good luck ;-)
[14:40:55] <LXGHTNXNG> Does W6600 have sriov?
[14:41:02] <epony> I only buy low profile 10-20W video cards
[14:41:16] <epony> the smaller wattage for same performance the better
[14:41:19] <haise01> lmao, S7150x2 is 500 euros here
[14:41:33] <epony> should do 2560x1440 accelerated these days
[14:41:48] <Hunterkll> teh_f4ll3n: oh no, i meant used on ebay
[14:41:52] <epony> mine do from 2010 and 2012
[14:41:57] <Hunterkll> teh_f4ll3n: i can buy new at MSRP all day long
[14:41:59] <Hunterkll> no markup
[14:42:38] <Hunterkll> epony: card i'm looking at will do detailed CAD re ndering for 10x workstations remotely 
[14:42:49] <teh_f4ll3n> Hunterkll, yeah, good luck on used ones. Pretty sure they're all ridden 'til dead
[14:42:58] <epony> fine
[14:43:04] <epony> probably in the Pro series
[14:43:07] <Hunterkll> teh_f4ll3n: damn shame since they natively support SR-IOV 
[14:43:11] <epony> FirePro or something
[14:43:12] <Hunterkll> epony: nope. not really
[14:43:20] <Hunterkll> firepro's not except one or two 
[14:43:26] <Hunterkll> one i got only did it via driver 
[14:43:33] <Hunterkll> for vGPU
[14:43:42] <epony> I just need 2k5 accelerated decoding of video
[14:43:53] <Hunterkll> shit just get anything then
[14:43:54] <Hunterkll> lol
[14:43:59] <epony> yeah but
[14:44:01] <Hunterkll> i'm looking to split it to multiple VMs 
[14:44:22] <epony> the accelerated draw / render is one thing, accelerated decode the other thing (missing yet)
[14:44:27] <Hunterkll> i'll just buy a new S card in a month or two 
[14:44:52] <Hunterkll> be my first ATI card since the early 2000s lol
[14:44:54] <epony> so you run separate power cables from teh wall socket too?
[14:45:06] <epony> cause you have only one shitty circuit breaker in your room
[14:45:14] <epony> ;-)
[14:45:18] <Hunterkll> S card i saw was rated for less than my desktop's two GPUs :P
[14:45:27] <Hunterkll> and i cut my power usage in half upgrading to that R730 
[14:45:39] <epony> dell fan
[14:45:45] <Hunterkll> naw
[14:45:51] <Hunterkll> HP versions were just more expensive
[14:45:59] <Hunterkll> wanted s omething with rails and cable management arm 
[14:46:16] <epony> I like HP but don't get them cause proprietary controllers and BIOS wobbles I can't deal with
[14:46:23] <Hunterkll> $1k for that gen I can easily swap parts in compared to my whitebox X5650 supermicro
[14:46:25] <Hunterkll> worth it
[14:46:26] <epony> same reasons for not careing about Dell
[14:46:43] <Hunterkll> i spent so much whiteboxing my shit
[14:46:45] <epony> too much cost and.. proprietary controllers and bios issues
[14:46:51] <Hunterkll> was just easier to all in one it 
[14:47:49] <epony> I like Atom CPUs
[14:48:01] <epony> and compact server boards (mini-ITX)
[14:48:03] <Hunterkll> early atoms sucked hard

[14:58:56] <Hunterkll> no?
[14:59:03] <epony> cause what good is one server..
[14:59:21] <Hunterkll> the same good as the 1 supermicro i had before
[14:59:28] <Hunterkll> that it replaced
[14:59:35] <Hunterkll> except far easier to diagnose and serevice 
[15:00:10] <epony> I don't see that ease here
[15:00:17] <epony> Dell have nothing in this region
[15:00:20] <epony> just fake resellers
[15:00:29] <Hunterkll> compared to a slapped together supermicro?
[15:00:31] <Hunterkll> erm
[15:00:46] <Hunterkll> i mean, easier to daignose, read the outputs, and buy parts off ebay with correct fault codes
[15:00:47] <Hunterkll> i guess
[15:00:58] <epony> maybe even slapped together consumer things is 2x for the same cost
[15:01:03] <Hunterkll> tired of spending hours over my supermicro shit to find a faulty ram sti9ck 
[15:01:14] <LXGHTNXNG> CAD 856.08, my Lenovo has cost me so far
[15:01:14] <epony> no parts from ebay, that's not nice
[15:01:19] <Hunterkll> my supermicro build at the end cost me like $3-4k all done 
[15:01:26] <epony> just new things
[15:01:31] <Hunterkll> the dell will cost me far less over the same timeframe
[15:01:33] <epony> and quality affordable

[15:02:30] <epony> and everything second hand is crappy foreign parts from ebay
[15:02:49] <LXGHTNXNG> ah, 967
[15:03:23] <epony> so, I'm just not a fan of old crap with parts that incur excess expenses compared to new parts
[15:03:44] <Hunterkll> hence why i went with the newer with far cheaper parts
[15:03:53] <LXGHTNXNG> maybe cad400 of which is paid off, the rest is on a credit card which I'll cash out my savings to pay

[15:40:53] <epony> around 2002-2004
[15:40:54] <PattyCakes> it looks like I murdered a hooker in my bed
[15:41:06] <LXGHTNXNG> https://access.redhat.com/solutions/103833
[15:41:08] <epony> and have not been using it since
[15:41:13] <PattyCakes> I mean Happy Monday!
[15:41:15] <LXGHTNXNG> you could turn it down to 10
[15:42:25] <epony> PattyCakes, look sideways when you visually inspect the fans of a working machine
[15:42:27] <monr0e> I'm going to have to look into that. This machine runs on old rust. It's a beater, but its what I use to test stuff on
[15:43:07] <monr0e> Although my daily machine that I use for actual work is a pretty similar setup, fedora host with a W7 vm. 
[15:43:20] <monr0e> It would be wonderful if I could get visual studio to run in proton 
[15:43:29] <epony> don't jynx it
[15:44:04] <LXGHTNXNG> meow
[15:44:17] <epony> the WIN/DOS in a guest VM is to get some Windows-only thing going occasionally, now how you should live and work for a dependable process / workflow
[15:46:16] <monr0e> I use the Vm on a daily basis. Its a bit frustrating, on my daily I don't allow the VM internet access, which means all the fileshare stuff has to go through a dead dir. I do have a W8.1 EIP VM, but that has some issues since it's technically a scaled down version of the OS intended for things like cashpoints, tills, etc
[15:47:17] <monr0e> I should probably just find an IDE I like that works natively on linux, but I've grown very accustomed to VS just... *working*
[15:47:37] <monr0e> It also plays very nicely with associated browsers and makes debugging an absolute breeze
[15:47:40] <LXGHTNXNG> Yeh..
[15:48:04] <epony> the strong pull of the dark side that is, it seems
[15:49:07] <monr0e> Tbh I know I'm being stupid, because I'm moving this entire C# web app to an nginx host anyway, which will raise all sorts of compat issues
[15:51:01] <LXGHTNXNG> uhh

[16:04:40] <Hunterkll> could go either way 
[16:04:56] <DrZak> soo, folks
[16:05:24] <estranger> sew
[16:07:26] <DrZak> i have here a request, where customer wants to save all mails coming in the system, they do a backup once a day, but obviously, if somebody deletes something through the day, its gone... my obvious idea was the so called litigation hold, am i missing something there? I mean, the backup solution doesn't backup the shadow queues and all that stuff
[16:08:06] <monr0e> Why does anyone have permissions to delete incoming mail? That sounds like a liability waiting to happen
[16:08:14] <DrZak> he?
[16:08:17] <SirSceptalot> he?
[16:08:28] <DrZak> no, i mean, bob gets an eamil, reads it, delets it
[16:08:28] <lancehead> HEE HEE
[16:08:33] <SirSceptalot> you don't let your users delete mail in their inbox?
[16:08:34] *** lancehead is now known as RealMichaelJacks
[16:08:37] <RealMichaelJacks> fuck
[16:08:39] <estranger> what mail system
[16:08:40] <DrZak> its ded before the daily backup catches it
[16:08:42] *** RealMichaelJacks is now known as lancehead
[16:08:45] <monr0e> Oh wait, I thought you meant this was a shared inbox
[16:08:49] <DrZak> oh, sorry, exchange
[16:08:55] <DrZak> nono, any mailbox
[16:08:55] <epony> muahahaha
[16:09:02] <Hunterkll> oh fuck yes
[16:09:05] <Hunterkll> it's not over yet
[16:09:09] <Hunterkll> but i doubled 11 on a 6
[16:09:12] <Hunterkll> ended up with 19
[16:09:18] <estranger> doesn't exchange have the ability to not delete email for x days after it's deleted?
[16:09:18] <xe0n> litigation hold or journaling
[16:09:18] <Hunterkll> could work out 
[16:09:33] <SirSceptalot> does anyone else here not know poker? I really don't understand anything of what Hunterkll is saying right now
[16:09:43] <estranger> first off it's not poker
[16:09:48] <DrZak> xe0n: yea, thought so
[16:09:49] <estranger> it's blackjack
[16:09:51] <SirSceptalot> right
[16:09:51] <epony> it's 21
[16:09:53] <SirSceptalot> BJ
[16:09:56] <SirSceptalot> oh
[16:09:58] <SirSceptalot> yeah
[16:10:07] <SirSceptalot> now it makes a lot more sense :D
[16:10:13] <estranger> lol
[16:10:14] <epony> 21 is the key word for blowjabs
[16:10:17] <Hunterkll> SirSceptalot: blackjack 
[16:10:26] <DrZak> i am also considering how much they piss me off, if i figure they piss me off a lot, i will sic them on EnterpriseVault
[16:10:37] <monr0e> I mean, still, if this is external mail coming in, would it not be wise to save a copy anyway? Interactions with external entities and all that. If a customer claims they sent x email x days ago and you're now outside your SLA, if you have no evidence of that whilst they do, they are not going to be a happy customer
[16:10:46] <estranger> blackjack is pretty easy.. there is almost always a mathematically correct move

[16:14:18] <monr0e> DrZak idk, it might have been a bug in line with the duplicate emails, maybe an issue with the switchover from HP to HPE
[16:14:21] <estranger> fucking data dog stop emailing me crap
[16:15:14] <SirSceptalot> ?
[16:15:29] <DrZak> ah
[16:15:42] <arlion> its fuckin cold outside
[16:15:45] <arlion> daaammmmm
[16:16:19] <monr0e> lancehead: The stock bootloader is pretty raw. afaik it doesn't suport much more than very basic boot functionality. Although tbf all I use my pi for is a media centre soooo
[16:16:22] <arlion> estranger: is datadog emailing you cause your shit is down or cause you need to pay money lol
[16:16:52] <lancehead> monr0e: Yeah I just realized that, it's literally just a physical chip that boots if the appropriate stuff is in /boot
[16:17:22] <lancehead> Guess I'll just lock down /boot somehow
[16:17:29] <monr0e> Yep. You could maybe jtag it and fuck around with whatever is on that chip, assuming it has memory and processing abilities, but thats a bit beyond scope I suspect
[16:18:19] <lancehead> It is yeah 
[16:18:20] <monr0e> Fail2ban, disable pi user, disable root SSH, kill any unnecessary services. Thats about all you can do tbh
[16:18:56] <LXGHTNXNG> nyaa?
[16:19:05] <lancehead> I've done all those yeah 
[16:19:07] <monr0e> Encryption is a bit hit&miss on the pi, it struggles with it in realtime. I tried a netflix addon for kodi a while back and it was a bit painful
[16:19:12] <monr0e> *on the pi
[16:19:36] <LXGHTNXNG> if only Pis could have hardware accelerated cryption
[16:19:39] <monr0e> although thtat *is* on a pi 3b
[16:19:53] <monr0e> newer models might have more success idk
[16:20:00] <lancehead> I tried looking into full disk encryption, problem is we have a script to roll out our required software on these and it'd be very hard to write in-place encryption in there 
[16:20:17] <monr0e> what does the pi do exactly?
[16:20:26] <lancehead> Er.. things 
[16:20:48] <monr0e> oh, ok np. Most of the time I'd say encryption on a pi service is more trouble than its wotrh
[16:21:01] <lancehead> Yeah I agree from what I've seen 
[16:21:24] <monr0e> Just put it behind a live firewall and you should be ok? I guess?
[16:21:52] <lancehead> That's the plan yeah; it's only hooked up to a router with a *lot* of network segmentation, nothing else directly 
[16:21:58] <signofzeta> arlion: yup. 1°F (-17°C) here this morning.
[16:22:06] <lancehead> So router firewall + pi firewall + fail2ban should do the trick 
[16:22:07] <monr0e> oh yeah, don't worry too much about it then
[16:22:15] <DrZak> i would love to live in a place with real winter

[18:21:37] <estranger> wait what, why?
[18:21:47] <PublicWifi> there's 2 common setups

[18:21:53] <AnonymooseReddtr> Not sure what the utility does there estranger but 
[18:22:01] <PublicWifi> grid tied REQUIRES the utility being on to work
[18:22:03] <AnonymooseReddtr> if your solar is tied to the grid you'll get a credit for the power generated

[18:22:05] <estranger> if the grid goes down can't the panels still charge the battery?

[20:31:57] <AnonymooseReddtr> you mean Datacenter? 
[20:32:06] <DomLS3> ??
[20:32:12] <AnonymooseReddtr> Windows server licensing
[20:32:18] <AnonymooseReddtr> that includes the guest vm license
[20:32:19] <DomLS3> All versions of Windows Server come with 2 VM licenses
[20:32:30] <DomLS3> standard, data center, etc
[20:32:31] <Bru^> standard = 2 VM licenses
[20:32:34] <Bru^> datacenter = unlimited
[20:32:37] <AnonymooseReddtr> ^^^
[20:32:37] <DomLS3> unless data center givs you unlimited
[20:32:38] <DomLS3> i think
[20:32:41] <DomLS3> yeah
[20:32:50] <PublicWifi> datacenter >>>>
[20:32:57] <DomLS3> but the point is that no matter what, you get at least 2
[20:33:03] <DomLS3> with the lowest version of Windows server
[20:33:07] <AnonymooseReddtr> right
[20:33:17] <AnonymooseReddtr> but I've never met a customer that wants to roll hyperv that does'nt have more than 2 :D
[20:33:19] <AnonymooseReddtr> just saying
[20:33:19] <fritzwastaken> Hrm, this ShotSpotter system is intersting
[20:33:22] <DomLS3> If you need more, buy more. Still ends up being cheaper than VMWare
[20:33:53] <DomLS3> AnonymooseReddtr: most customers also have more than 1 server license
[20:33:58] <teh_f4ll3n> me: "Click View Errors" -- "What happens when I do that?" -- "Hmmm... you launch a nuke at America"
[20:34:02] <DomLS3> And you can use them all on one VM host if you want
[20:34:22] <DomLS3> so if you have 5 physical server standard servers, you can use the +2 VM licenses on one VM host to license it for 10 VMs
[20:35:14] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> as long as you get the cores
[20:35:22] <AnonymooseReddtr> erm not sure about that Dom
[20:35:23] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> cuz each of the +2 vm licenses require core cals
[20:35:46] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> So if your host has 16 cores, you can purchase 16 core standard license pack and get 2 VMs, of standard
[20:35:54] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> and stack
[20:36:00] <Bru^> yeah
[20:36:04] <Bru^> minimum purchase is 16 core now too
[20:36:07] <AnonymooseReddtr> i hate licensing
[20:36:09] *** Quits: shibboleth (~shibbolet@user/shibboleth) (Quit: shibboleth)
[20:36:09] <DomLS3> Yeah that's correct
[20:36:14] <AnonymooseReddtr> I just tell my customers that they need E5 and thats it
[20:36:19] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> also, don't forget, if it's in a cluster, you need to license *all* hosts of the cluster
[20:36:23] <Bru^> yep
[20:36:25] <AnonymooseReddtr> ^
[20:36:27] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> if it hosts workloads or not. It's the 'if it can' thing
[20:36:32] <AnonymooseReddtr> and if its not clusterd you need to re-evaluate your life
[20:36:37] <DomLS3> Still cheaper than VMWare
[20:36:54] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> sure is. but isn't as feature rich. but gets the job done for 90% of people
[20:37:01] <AnonymooseReddtr> I rolled a 3 node Hyperv cluster at an old job
[20:37:04] <AnonymooseReddtr> worked great
[20:37:10] <signofzeta> yup, and if you have a lot of VMs, you might want to splurge for Datacenter.  besides having unlimited licensing, it adds AVMA.
[20:37:14] <AnonymooseReddtr> actually all the jobs I had that ran virtuals were using hyperv 
[20:37:22] <DomLS3> meh. There's few instances where VMware's features are actually more beneficial to justify the added cost
[20:37:56] <signofzeta> VMware's USB redirection is nice for dongles, but if you have a cluster, one of those USB->IP converters might be best.

[20:48:58] <DomLS3> why even go to 365 if you're going to use ADFS and still limit yourself to service outages due to on prem issues
[20:49:10] <AnonymooseReddtr> signofzeta yeah thats fair 
[20:49:20] <AnonymooseReddtr> DomLS3 you could go O365 and then use pass thru auth
[20:49:26] <AnonymooseReddtr> assuming you have multiple sites and multiple DC's
[20:49:28] <signofzeta> And I agree AAD Connect is enough for most people, there are a few who would benefit from AD FS.  But PLEASE spread it across multiple servers/Internet connections.
[20:49:33] <DomLS3> AnonymooseReddtr: you don't need ADFS for pass-thru

[21:20:31] <DomLS3> so we have tp add the step of clearing out the last person's cell number in our offboarding procedures
[21:20:38] <DomLS3> but that's all powershell anyway
[21:21:21] <PublicWifi> yuck
[21:22:03] <DomLS3> yuck? The alternative would be even more yuck
[21:22:21] <PublicWifi> no i mean I understand why its a pain in the ass
[21:22:27] <AnonymooseReddtr> I mean, 
[21:22:31] <AnonymooseReddtr> good on you for forcing MFA at least
[21:22:41] <DomLS3> to be honest, I don't want to
[21:22:48] <DomLS3> but it's a necessary thing to do
[21:22:53] <AnonymooseReddtr> i like the ability to dothat with CA

[23:34:26] <PublicWifi> this stupid network guy keeps saying he thinks its fortigate's constant ARP requests
[23:34:32] <PublicWifi> but I added a static ARP and it didn't stop lol
[23:36:13] <fritzwastaken> lol vinrock just wait till they ask PublicWifi how he got their name and number
[23:36:19] <fritzwastaken> "Dude on the internet gave it to me"

[23:36:49] <vinrock> sup
[23:37:16] <sd> 04<F​eralTerminator> Had a shop that needed help today. So I call em up and ask "Hey can I remote in and fix your bluesheet?"
[23:37:24] <sd> 04<F​eralTerminator> Oh yeah go right ahead
[23:37:30] <vinrock> PORN
[23:37:53] <sd> 04<F​eralTerminator> So I remote in right away and start fixing things.. dude is ON THE PHONE the entire time and were bullshitting while we talk shit about the computers
[23:38:14] <PublicWifi> fap fap fap 
[23:38:30] <sd> 04<F​eralTerminator> One of the ladies get a call from that shop. The person was complaining that their computer was not working and the mouse was moving on its own
[23:38:42] <vinrock> lol
[23:38:48] <vinrock> we've been hacked!!
[23:39:27] <sd> 04<F​eralTerminator> So not knowing whats going on and the lady acting like its an emergency I'm like "Oh hey I gotta get this. I'll be right back bud" and drop the connection to ask her to repeat what she said
[23:40:42] <sd> 04<F​eralTerminator> "Maumee's on the phone and said their computer isnt working"... What do you mean Maumee is on the phone? I was just on their computer... Why are they calling you if he's on the phone with me at the same time? WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING!!! Was my phone call a dream"
[23:41:01] <signofzeta> This is why it's important to establish a Point of Contact (POC) with a customer.
[23:41:09] <signofzeta> I've had those tickets before.

[23:48:45] <signofzeta> Dude, Knoxville took a motorcycle wheel to the crotch and had to pee with a catheter with three and a half years.  and he still says his concussion/broken rib from Jackass Forever was easily worse.
[23:49:18] <signofzeta> The concussion gave him clinical depression that he legit needed medicine and therapy to start overcoming.  that's why he's done with dangerous stunts.
[23:49:40] <PublicWifi> apparently he scored a 18/100 on his cognitive assessment?
[23:49:47] <PublicWifi> which is worse than dementia or soemthing lol
[23:50:02] <PublicWifi> or 16/100 or something
[23:50:06] <signofzeta> yeah, he got hit hard
[23:50:16] <signofzeta> but that's worse than almost losing your penis
[23:50:28] <signofzeta> to be fair, I understand.

[23:51:58] <signofzeta> he started off writing for "Big Brother".  Maybe he could fall back to that, and do stunts not involving his head or groin.

[23:52:31] <signofzeta> happy ending: despite breaking his penis that badly, he fathered two more kids after that stunt.

[23:58:42] <monr0e> Hedgies are the real cults
[23:58:56] <monr0e> On a serious note, yeah its kinda weird that everyone chose this hill to die on 
[23:59:05] <monr0e> but if the end result is a positive for the consumer? I'm game
[23:59:12] <MoonBounce> uhhmm
[23:59:13] <monr0e> I happen to hold some shares myself
[23:59:21] <MoonBounce> the real end result is thousands of people left with the bags holding
[23:59:25] <MoonBounce> thinking gme will hit millions
[23:59:34] <monr0e> Oh its never gonna hit big numbers
[23:59:37] <MoonBounce> the smart people got out already lol
[23:59:57] <monr0e> The point is to force hedgies to give up on this sorta shorting behaviour
