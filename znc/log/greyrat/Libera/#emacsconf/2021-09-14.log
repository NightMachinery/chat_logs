[20:45:54] <alphapapa[m]> Would it be too annoying or self-centered if I asked about my EmacsConf poster again?  Not to imply that it must be used, but if it's intended to use it, I just don't want it to be forgotten until it's too late, and have to wait another year.  :)
[20:48:22] <zaeph> alphapapa[m]: https://paste.xinu.at/8vE/
[20:48:47] <zaeph> I am intending to use it; I'm just a little swamped with pro stuff right now.
[20:49:43] <zaeph> …And, since I have the tendency to invest all my waking hours into SVG projects, I'm making sure not to get pulled in too deeply whilst I still have commitments to meet.
[20:49:53] <zaeph> Sorry for the 1y+ delay!
[20:59:10] <alphapapa[m]> zaeph: Of course, I understand.  And the "year delay" is not on you; I was the one who submitted it at the last minute last year.  :)
[20:59:46] <alphapapa[m]> zaeph: Nice looking agenda, BTW :)
[21:00:18] <zaeph> alphapapa[m]: Made even nicer by org-super-agenda. (✿ ᵔ⌣ᵔ)
[21:01:02] <alphapapa[m]> zaeph: Have you seen my taxy-org-ql-view preview thingy screenshots?  It will probably obsolete org-super-agenda eventually.
[21:01:29] <zaeph> More seriously, I've had it on my board for a couple of weeks, but we haven't been able to meet with the others since.
[21:01:52] <zaeph> alphapapa[m]: I did see your post, yes, but I deliberately looked away because I can't afford to get nerd-sniped this September.
[21:02:18] <zaeph> I like the nesting a lot,.
[21:02:31] <alphapapa[m]> zaeph: LOL, yeah, I engaged in a bit of nerd-sniping myself recently
[21:04:00] <alphapapa[m]> zaeph: I've got the column formatting and indentation working well now, very customizeable, and everything's defined with top-level Lisp forms, which makes it very easy to manage, and even for users to add to (e.g. defining their own column is as simple as (taxy-org-ql-view-define-column "HEADING" (OPTIONS) BODY...))
[21:05:10] <zaeph> And this is fully done within your org-ql facility, or can you also include it in your agenda?  I think I remember your org-ql doing some extra optimisation/caching that org-agenda doesn't do.
[21:10:34] <alphapapa[m]> This is part of org-ql-view, which provides an alternative to some of org-agenda's functionality.  It does also provide org-ql-block, which can insert org-ql queries into org-agenda buffers, but that's not directly relate to this.  I hope org-ql-view will eventually provide a more complete alternative to org-agenda buffers, but that's a long-term goal.
[21:13:12] <zaeph> Right.  Maybe we should team up in that effort because I've also done significant work with org-agenda (which we've already discussed in the past).  I was more thinking of ways to improve the parsing of org-agenda-files whilst preserving the current UX, but it feels like you've been covering that UX front nicely on your end.
[21:14:32] <alphapapa[m]> zaeph: Sure, feel free to chime in.  With org-ql, I've tried to cleanly separate the search backend from the view frontend.
[21:15:53] <zaeph> It feels reminiscent of org-element and org-agenda in that way.
[21:15:56] <alphapapa[m]> basically, org-ql selects entries that match a query, org-element parses a matching entry into a useful structure, and org-ql-view formats those structures for display.
[21:16:40] <zaeph> Ugh, vade retro, Satanas~!
[21:17:08] <zaeph> As interested as I'd be in working on this now, I've gotta invest my curiosity into other topics now, for the sake of my own financial sustainability. :o)
[21:17:42] <alphapapa[m]> :)
[21:23:10] <zaeph> I'll probably have some time around December to think about it; I'll ping you.
[21:23:29] <zaeph> …By 'thinking about it', I mean designing it, not just entertaining the thought.
[21:25:51] <alphapapa[m]> I look forward to it
[21:27:34] <bandali> alphapapa[m], re poster: my apologies also. i still haven't logged into reddit again after asking for it and after you sent it via dm to. i'll grab it tonight :) thanks for the reminder
[21:27:49] <bandali> s/dm to/dm to me/
[21:31:32] <blackbeard> hi
[21:31:34] <blackbeard> :) 
[21:31:41] <zaeph> Hello~!
[21:31:49] <blackbeard> I want to participate but I am afraid I'll be boring or not interesting hahaha
[21:32:09] <blackbeard> I wanted to talk about my journey as a lawyer and emacs user
[21:32:18] <blackbeard> but I feel my use is kinda simple :p
[21:32:30] <blackbeard> or not simple, but just common
[21:32:38] <blackbeard> I use org-mode 
[21:32:48] <zaeph> At the very core, everything we do is simple, be it programming, editing text, or whatever.
[21:33:13] <blackbeard> I write everything in org-mode even law documents and my master thesis
[21:33:16] <zaeph> So, not only are you very welcome in participating here, but you're also very welcome in submitting a proposal for this year's edition.
[21:33:24] <blackbeard> and I use it to programming 
[21:34:30] <alphapapa[m]> <bandali> "alphapapa, re poster: my..." <- No problem.  Thanks.  :)
[21:35:05] <alphapapa[m]> blackbeard: I think many people would be interested in a presentation about how you use Org for those things
[21:35:52] <bandali> cheers :)
[21:35:52] <blackbeard> yeah I guess I could give a quick talk 
[21:36:12] <blackbeard> I don't know, when you hang out in /r/emacs you see a lot of cool stuff
[21:36:17] <bandali> blackbeard, hey :) you probably already know this, but i very much agree with zaeph and alphapapa[m] ;)
[21:36:22] <blackbeard> My useage I feel is too vanilla
[21:36:49] <bandali> that's completely fine :) i don't think there's really such thing as "too vanilla" tho :p
[21:37:06] <alphapapa[m]> barbanegra: Do you post on r/emacs?  There are at least a few lawyers there who use Emacs and Org
[21:37:21] <blackbeard> I have posted before, but not much
[21:37:50] <blackbeard> I usually just.. what's the word? watch everything without participatin
[21:38:27] <alphapapa[m]> barbanegra: aka "missing out"
[21:38:35] <alphapapa[m]> j/k  :)  you mean "lurking"
[21:38:47] <blackbeard> hahaha yeah lurking
[21:42:56] <blackbeard> Ok I have a day off on thursday
[21:43:09] <blackbeard> I will try to think of something and come back here with a more concrete idea
[21:43:11] <blackbeard> :) 
[21:43:32] <zaeph> You still have until the end of the month to submit something, so you don't need to rush it.
