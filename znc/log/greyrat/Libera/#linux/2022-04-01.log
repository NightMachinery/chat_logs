[00:01:28] <suid_dumpable> realtek changes their chipset about every 6 months and provides horrible out of tree vendor drivers
[00:01:36] <jim> we could try it (or not)... sounds like fedora is a good choice too, since it has plenty of compiled, packaged software available

[05:05:00] <noobaroo> I've used PeaZip recently though and it also effectively modifies ISO with ease. Takes like 5 seconds, if not less
[05:05:36] <mlu> that sounds painful
[05:05:47] <mlu> if it was easy to modify an ISO, it wouldn't have taken anywhere near 5sec

[05:15:49] <Sauvin> So, what you do is mount it, copy it, modify the copy and do the growisofs thing.

[13:05:38] <DPA> The difference is, with a bounce, the client sending the mail gets "250 2.0.0 Ok: queued as XXX", and the server would have to send a mail to notify of the error. But rejecting right away would return "550 5.7.1 message content rejected" directly to the client, which is what I would want it to do.

[13:22:59] <DPA> I do set rather restrictive SPF, DKIM, DMARC, etc. for my outgoing mail, but for incoming, I only check SPF and DKIM. Usually, those can only be sent by authenticated users. I do not use things like spamassasin, but I have some header_checks. But the latter are no good for base64 encoded stuff.
[13:22:59] <DPA> Also, even with spam, I think a reply matters. After all, there is still a big possibility that a spam mail may spoof it's origin, and that that one may accept a bounce mail.

[21:20:42] <Dagmar> If they're not using a properly signed cert, they're wasting your time
[21:20:55] <aruns> It's Azure.
[21:21:00] <koollman> lftp can manage pretty much anything
[21:21:02] <Dagmar> Without a signed cert there's nothing stopping a MITM attack
[21:21:11] <ayecee> aruns: you keep saying that, but it doesn't affect this at all.
[21:21:35] <ayecee> could be azure, could be aws, could be a pi in your buddy's basement

[23:10:55] <matsaman> as you should, it's the most straightforward way for a human to do it
[23:11:03] <msiism> Depends.
[23:11:15] <hexnewbie> For +X, chmod(path, st.st_mode | (S_ISDIR(st.st_mode) || st.st_mode & 111) ? 0111 : 0); clearly, symbolic is superior here
