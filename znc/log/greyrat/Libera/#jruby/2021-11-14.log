[21:46:25] <anewbhav[m]> Hello Folks.... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/1a8e8d5c722076ce951df0a85ad205d930595970)
[22:37:15] <mattpatt[m]> anewbhav: there's a whole lot of JDK-related stuff still settling down, mostly JFFI related (a lot of it waiting on Apple to upstream things, IIRC) - you'd be much better off using an x86 JDK and running it via Rosetta for the moment - it works fine.
[22:37:20] <mattpatt[m]> (I do that)
