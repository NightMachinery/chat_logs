[00:35:49] <beastDiv1> ktosiek: not sure how there could be a network issue, they're both running in docker on the same physical machine, the migration is like 20 different alter fields for big auto field, upgrading from django 3.1 to 3.2.

[00:36:13] <beastDiv1> my database is like maybe half a peta byte at the moment, hundreds of billions of rows
[00:36:16] *** Joins: llanhmod (~developer@user/domhnall/x-2887755)
[00:38:48] <beastDiv1> but i think most of the tables the alter fields are on are not that big, maybe like a couple billion rows each on average
[00:44:05] <ktosiek> You do know you don't have to change those fields, and certainly not all at once?

[00:57:26] <beastDiv1> right, I did read it
[00:58:18] <beastDiv1> doesn't tell me anything about why the migration is failing, I've never had an issue with migrations failing with just zero useful output in over 4 years of running this project

[00:59:47] <ktosiek> It tells you why the migration popped up in the first place. If you don't feel a need to migrate to bigger PKs, just remove that migration and change the default field in settings.

[01:02:58] <beastDiv1> well I would like to migrate to the bigger pk's, as the database is just gonna keep growing. The majority of the migrations worked just fine. I think it just has something to do with one of my really big tables. I'm looking for some kind of solution here, i just don't know how, is there a way to "buffer" a migration or something? postgres says the issue is with django and django says the issue is
[01:03:00] <beastDiv1> with postgres, and neither give enough info to figure out which is the real culprit, so I just don't know where to take this or how to resolve it
[01:03:54] <ktosiek> The issue is with a dropped connection, maybe something in your stack doesn't like idle TCP connections?
[01:04:19] <ktosiek> You could split the migration into smaller ones, maybe that will be good enough.

[03:38:19] *** Joins: fikran (~fikran@user/fikran)
[03:44:11] <dupi3> In the django deployment checklist docs it says to load it from a file, on guides over the internet I always see python-dotenv as the recommended method.
[03:49:57] <GinFuyou> environment vars is a fine and common method, setting it up varies. I prefer django-classy-settings that comes with it
[03:56:18] <PaulWay[w]> IMO unless you're doing a wide-area distributed deployment where your code is going to be on
[03:56:34] <PaulWay[w]> machines that lots of people that you don't entirely trust can access, I think just keeping
[03:56:48] <PaulWay[w]> the SECRET_KEY in the settings.py is reasonable.
[03:57:15] <PaulWay[w]> Your operating system's user access control will do the main job of preventing people reading

[09:11:14] <blackleitus> how do you build a mvp where UI is sort of important?
[09:12:18] <blackleitus> I am installing this one https://pagedraw.io/ in order to get some template figma
[09:15:52] <dre> blackleitus, take it from me; I got stuck in this a lot. the UI is not as important as you think.
[09:16:22] <dre> as long as it works, you can get away almost entirely with basic tables and buttons.
[09:16:30] <dre> bootstrap is even nicer, but it's not needed.
[09:16:47] <dre> you will forever be stuck. Like I often am
[09:17:29] <blackleitus> really? let's say you wanna build a investment management platform in order to get clients , you will need a good ui/ux , but how to go to market?
[09:19:04] <dre> blackleitus, "build an investment management platform" -- have you seen how shit most bank/ investment platforms are?
[09:19:10] <dre> that's exactly what I mean .
[09:19:21] <dre> you do not need good ui / ux.
[09:19:35] <dre> you go to market once you have users.
[09:19:38] <blackleitus> I was comparing with this https://dribbble.com/blackleitus/collections/5432326-investment-management-platform
[09:20:04] <dre> these are all just bootstrap templates
[09:20:16] <dre> anyway, I've got to work~!~~~
[09:21:25] <blackleitus> if I gave up , I will end up by using boostrap + jquery ajax for api calls

[12:04:28] <dre> is there a way to set up django templates
[12:04:59] <dre> such that, there might be a root template with a <ul> in it. and each app can input it's own <li> inside of it?
[12:05:49] <dre> so like, a new app could be made that just makes a new entry on the nav-bar, for instance.

[12:09:47] <ktosiek> serafeim: thanks for the heads up, I'm on 3.2 and don't see any warnings about using ugettext_lazy
[12:10:59] <ktosiek> dre: you'd need some way to register those apps. This can be done with signals, or adding something to a global list from the app's AppConfig.ready
[12:11:24] <dre> How would you do it on the template?
[12:11:53] <ktosiek> you'd get all the collected snippets, and add it to template's context
[12:12:00] <dre> {% for app in settings.INSTALLED_APPS %}    ?
[12:12:16] <dre> oh, yeah; hm, right.
[12:12:29] <dre> that might be overly complicated / not suitable.
[12:13:05] <dre> I have an already existing application; I want to be able to make a "plugin" (app) that can add itself to any menu item

[12:13:58] <ktosiek> why plugin? Is it meant to be distributed separately?
[12:15:05] <dre> yeah, it's meant to be swappable for anything else, or not used entirely
[12:15:43] *** Joins: fikran (~fikran@user/fikran)
[12:15:44] <dre> but I can understand it would be difficult; for now I'll just hard-code it into the template with a comment to remove this if we remove the app .
[12:17:27] <ktosiek> I like to use some kind of feature flags for this kind of options (a custom thing in settings, or even a separate model with flags for each tenant), this way you can test multiple variations from one codebase.
[12:17:58] <dre> we actually use feature flags for a lot of things
[12:18:28] <dre> but this is a case where our architecture is starting to lean into the "plugin/app" style a little more, because the codebase is getting big.
[12:18:33] <dre> and we've got a lot of different clients.

[12:19:30] <dre> for this; I have to make a new view / functionality, but only for one client ( a big one ) -- so it fits the plugin model in some ways.. not everyone would need it, but if someone does, they could just copy and modify it to work for another client / usecase etc.
[12:20:01] <dre> but the template is a little iffy to make it "nice" -- I think putting it in core but disabled for all but-one is a bit of a crappy situation

[12:23:43] <apollo13> serafeim: we have years of backwards compat, there is really no reason to keep multiple aliases to a function
[12:24:35] <serafeim> apollo13: the reason is to make update NOT a PITA. this is just an alias that doesn't have any consequences
[12:24:49] <serafeim> there's no real reason to remove that alias. only blind bureocracy
[12:25:06] <dre> couldn't you just find and replace serafeim
[12:25:17] <dre> ilu~
[12:25:21] <ktosiek> serafeim: worst case scenario - you can monkeypatch them in
[12:25:21] <serafeim> dre: in my project of course. my project has like 10 deps
[12:25:32] <serafeim> ktosiek: yes i have alread done that
[12:25:39] <serafeim> but it was a PITA.
[12:25:49] <apollo13> serafeim: well that is on the dependencies then isn't it, they should use deprecated stuff
[12:26:12] <serafeim> yes i know but some people don't update their repos too frequently
[12:26:28] <apollo13> well then maybe you shouldn't be using that dependency or provide a patch to them
[12:26:49] <serafeim> the thing is that the only thing that removing ugettext did is to make updating to django 4.x a PITA
[12:27:07] <serafeim> if that was a real change then i'd agree with that. but they just removed these aliases "because"
[12:27:13] <dre> apollo13, what are your thoughts on my idea above? any quick-n-easy wins here? ( even if I could just do a {% if my-app-is-loaded %} render stuff {% endif %}
[12:27:30] <apollo13> serafeim: no it is not just "because" -- an alias has wide reaching consquences as far as documentation etc goes
[12:27:41] <serafeim> django core must consider the consequences of their actions not blindly follow some written to stone rules.
[12:27:51] <apollo13> believe me we do
[12:27:59] <serafeim> apollo13: no reason to keep it in the docs. just leave that alias there to keep projects working
[12:28:02] <apollo13> that is why we have a backwards compat policy and deprecation process
[12:28:20] <apollo13> if you have a problem with that use another framework, though I doubt that you find many more conservative ones than django
[12:28:22] <serafeim> i can provide you like 5 projects (well known) that don't support the ugettext thing
[12:28:48] <apollo13> there is plenty of reason to leave it in the docs
[12:29:03] <apollo13> people looking at code will not know what that function is or why it exists if it is not in the docs
[12:29:04] <serafeim> apollo13: i dont' have a problem with django. i even bitten the bullet and updated everything
[12:29:34] <serafeim> but it is an alias.
[12:29:41] <serafeim> they will know what it is
[12:29:52] <apollo13> which you will only know if you go through the code and search for it
[12:30:10] <serafeim> yes
[12:30:13] <apollo13> and I am not going to look, but it was probably there for a relatively long time
[12:30:27] <serafeim> it was there because of python 2 i guess
[12:30:31] <serafeim> unicode gettext

[12:35:30] <dre> yeah i guess
[12:35:37] <serafeim> yes i know. i totally agree with the deprecation policy of django. this thing should have definitely been removed *if* that removal was useful
[12:35:39] <dre> cheers for the thoughts though
[12:35:52] <dre> serafeim, removing dead code is useful
[12:35:55] <dre> code is a liability.
[12:36:01] <dre> remove as much of it as possible
[12:36:10] <serafeim> dre: this wasn't a dead code. this was an alias
[12:36:15] <serafeim> ugettext = gettext
[12:36:20] <serafeim> that was the code thatt was removed
[12:36:27] <dre> I know
[12:36:33] <serafeim> but that thing broke like 100 packages
[12:37:01] <serafeim> and as i said i can right now give you 10 packages that still don't support django 4 because of that line that some people removed without thinking it
[12:37:05] * dre starts thinking about a nice way to monkey patch it, getting in the python internals

[15:29:11] <serafeim> varoo: there are a couple of 10+ year long open tickets. that's what i'd like solving on django
[15:29:31] <serafeim> definitely not the django.redis integration
[15:30:14] <varoo> where can i find those tickets? I checked github django/django and couldn't find anything over there
[15:30:39] <serafeim> the tickets are on the trac
[15:30:56] <serafeim> here https://code.djangoproject.com/query
[15:32:54] <serafeim> django having so many open tickets and still being the best web framework ever is really funny for me
[15:33:42] <serafeim> look at this for example: https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/10621
[15:33:52] <serafeim> 13 years ago
[15:33:54] <varoo> Holy, i never realised ya all had so many open tickets
[15:35:03] <varoo> I hope i can help in closing one of the tickets since im just a beginner and never worked on a real project like this
[15:36:00] <serafeim> i there the are some easy tickets
[15:36:42] <serafeim> these https://code.djangoproject.com/query?status=assigned&status=new&easy=1&order=id are supposed to be easy
[15:38:10] <varoo> thanks alot i'll try my best to close the unassigned one by next week!
