[03:21:36] <FromDiscord> <geekrelief> I see, yeah macros are kind of annoying.  I'm trying to make `genit` something in between a template and macro. Please tell me if inline templates are a terrible idea, and if I'm a horrible person for suggesting it.
[03:22:50] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Well it has a purpose since you use it, but it's quite hard to read
[03:24:27] <FromDiscord> <geekrelief> I was playing around with various ways to make it cleaner.  I don't know if it's a syntax issue or what. Simply replacing the slashes with dashes or something else might make it easier to read, but I want those things to stand out.  Unfortunately, there's always a tradeoff between conciseness and readability.
[03:24:55] <FromDiscord> <geekrelief> Kind of like regular expressions.
[03:25:56] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> sent a code paste, see https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3G1T
[03:26:36] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> the same with the tuples
[03:26:59] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> `it[0]` for your insertion and then `[](it, 0)` for the index operator
[03:27:31] <FromDiscord> <geekrelief> In reply to @Elegantbeef "So my suggestion would": I thought about replacing `str_it` with `$it`, but I didn't want to interfere with intentional usage of `$`, same goes for tuples and indexing.
[03:27:57] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Sure but if you do the way i suggested it's clean and you dont directly interfere
[03:28:23] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I guess i messed up the example since it should be `$it` in the first one
[03:28:45] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> You of course need to do the accquoted call, but that's cleaner than these magic variables imo
[03:28:46] <FromDiscord> <geekrelief> I think that might be even more confusing to read.
[03:29:54] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> sent a code paste, see https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3G1V
[03:30:12] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> It's generally cleaner i think
[03:31:22] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> `var /r /c` do you need to escape these with `/`
[03:32:05] <FromDiscord> <geekrelief> It makes it clearer what variables are for substitution.
[03:32:42] <FromDiscord> <geekrelief> it's possible the user wants to use short variable names in their template.  Plus I want those symbols to jump out at you for readability.
[03:33:23] <FromDiscord> <geekrelief> But maybe that's not necessary.
[03:33:47] <FromDiscord> <geekrelief> I'll play around with your suggestions.  Thanks!

[03:33:58] <FromDiscord> <geekrelief> Yeah I thought of templates as a counterpoint.
[03:34:39] <FromDiscord> <geekrelief> But I wanted to keep the syntax in the domain of a DSL because I'm still experimenting with what I want this to be.

[22:00:32] <FromDiscord> <leorize> yes it is, but it's hard and not very well supported
[22:00:56] <FromDiscord> <Recruit_main707> well, its not hard, as in harder than in c or c++
[22:01:01] <FromDiscord> <Schelz> Can you tell me please the module name ?
[22:01:15] <FromDiscord> <Recruit_main707> there is an example kernel out there
[22:01:16] <FromDiscord> <leorize> `--os:any` and `--gc:arc` or `--gc:orc` is your friend for this, but documentation is very scarce

[22:02:01] <FromDiscord> <Schelz> thanks
[22:02:25] <FromDiscord> <leorize> Zevv did create an effort for building Linux kernel with Nim
[22:02:45] <FromDiscord> <leorize> I believe they are now a part of `--os:any`, but its sorta hairy
[22:09:23] <Zevv> --os:any integrates pretty well with the linux kernel; you do need to provide some glue though to provide basic things like malloc() and printf() which are assumed to be available by nim
[22:09:45] <Zevv> but it's too late right, rust was there first
[22:10:29] <FromDiscord> <retkid> so like
[22:10:34] <FromDiscord> <retkid> what editor / ide you use
[22:10:42] <FromDiscord> <retkid> i dont wanna use vscode but i cant find anything as good
[22:11:11] <FromDiscord> <retkid> I've tried various emacs and vim, geney, etc
[22:11:18] <Zevv> what's your problem with those
[22:11:23] <Zevv> the editors themselves of the nim integration?
[22:12:01] <FromDiscord> <retkid> I like geany but no NIm intergration and god knows what other features i might need that it just wont have
[22:12:16] <Zevv> i don't know geany, doesn't it provide LSP support?
[22:12:27] <Zevv> that's the factory standard glue to any language server these days
[22:12:29] <FromDiscord> <Recruit_main707> there is intellij but its not better than vscode
[22:13:06] <FromDiscord> <Recruit_main707> it is promising tho, but it wasnt updated in a while either (the develoepr was gonna work on it soon in theory tho)
[22:13:58] <FromDiscord> <retkid> no LSP
[22:14:10] <FromDiscord> <retkid> Inteliji is mostly closed source?
[22:14:13] <FromDiscord> <retkid> i dunno
[22:14:38] <FromDiscord> <Recruit_main707> it does have lsp, but it doesnt work well
[22:15:06] <FromDiscord> <retkid> I don't like intelij because of lack of syntax highlighting for Java and Kotlin, it doesn''t have every single element differentiated so some of the functions are just white
[22:15:25] <FromDiscord> <retkid> and when i see white functions i just have panic attacks i dont know why
[22:15:39] <FromDiscord> <retkid> syntax coloring being wrong is just a fucking panic attack

[22:17:30] <nrds> <06Prestige99> Seems that nimsuggest might be our biggest issue atm
[22:19:08] <FromDiscord> <IsaacPaul> In reply to @IsaacPaul "What happens if I": Nim won't let you allocate above stack size it's all evaluated at compile time. If its on the heap then it's a ref and returns nil when out of memory (no exception thrown)
[22:32:37] <FromDiscord> <exelotl> Prestige: yep, afaik nimsuggest won't need to be a daemon anymore. It'll just be a simple command that reads the intermediate ".rod" files and returns a result
[22:33:17] <FromDiscord> <IsaacPaul> In reply to @IsaacPaul "Nim won't let you": infinitely adding to a seq will eventually make the program hang and the os complain about the system being out of memory (on macos)
[22:34:30] <FromDiscord> <exelotl> I don't really know the details, but I wonder if reading every rodfile from disk every time could be expensive, so maybe having it as a daemon would still be beneficial
[22:34:39] <FromDiscord> <exelotl> but the work it has to do would be much simpler I guess

[23:05:30] <arkanoid> the nim roadmap posted by araq says "More of the standard library should be moved to external Nimble packages. How far we get with this is unclear." this concept of moving things out of the standard library is making me more and more uncertain about the future of the language ecosystem. What's the point of moving a nim module from the "approved by the nim masters" bucket to the "community" bucket? I'm
[23:05:32] <arkanoid> already having problems in finding out which "community" module should be used or not
[23:08:14] <arkanoid> I mean, the nim community is not so large to give obvious direction about which community modules should be used. I could use github metadata, or suggestion from forum, but none of this comes before the stdlib
