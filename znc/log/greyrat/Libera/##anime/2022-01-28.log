[08:46:18] <ketchupicecream> nice
[08:46:38] <MootPoot> My face feels like loli oshiri
[08:46:44] <Sadale> MootPoot, What's that piece of plastic with a spring in it?
[08:46:59] <MootPoot> its a onah-
[08:47:00] <ketchupicecream> scale
[08:47:04] <MootPoot> lol
[08:47:11] <MootPoot> just some rifle mags
[08:47:27] <Sadale> lol
[08:47:45] <Sadale> onahole ain't made of plastic and spring. That's why I askede xD
[08:48:02] <MootPoot> fully atomated ones do
[08:48:07] <MootPoot> I got one once
[08:48:10] <MootPoot> returned it
[08:48:14] <MootPoot> too big and heavy to manage
[08:48:25] <MootPoot> and also the hole was too small
[08:48:46] <Sadale> Oh. Battery powered onahole?
[08:48:58] <MootPoot> seemed like it was designed for somebody with a 8" long pp that is very skinny
[08:49:09] <MootPoot> Sadale: no, one of those expensive ones that jerk you off too
[08:49:14] <MootPoot> not just a vibrator one
[08:49:20] <Sadale> ah. I know this kind
[08:49:31] <Sadale> They aren't that expensive AFAIK. The cheaper automated one costs like maybe $50-100.
[08:49:34] <MootPoot> I told customer support their hole was too small
[08:49:39] <MootPoot> then they refunded me
[08:49:39] <MootPoot> :3
[08:49:43] <ketchupicecream> lol
[08:49:46] <Sadale> lol and how come you could actually return it?
[08:50:00] <Sadale> MootPoot, Did you get to keep the onahole tho
[08:50:05] <MootPoot> lol no
[08:50:07] <MootPoot> mailed it back
[08:50:13] <Sadale> lolwut?
[08:50:15] <MootPoot> not like it was used - I couldn't get my pp in
[08:50:15] <Sadale> Scary
[08:50:19] <Sadale> but HEY!
[08:50:26] <Sadale> That counts as being used.

[08:51:11] <Sadale> yes. I use fceux
[08:51:41] <MootPoot> I went to the office today and handed in my laptop
[08:51:48] <MootPoot> it was pretty cool actually
[08:51:51] <ketchupicecream> Sadale: maybe the next buyer doesn't care

[08:52:28] <Sadale> I mean it's sex toy. I'm gonna insert my pp into a toy that someone else's pp had touched it.
[08:52:40] <jessedesu2> Sloppy seconds
[08:53:03] <amigojapan> jessedesu2: it's an emulator for the raspberry pi
[08:53:28] <jessedesu2> Do I need it
[08:53:38] <jessedesu2> Or can it run on a pc
[08:53:47] <amigojapan> Do you have an RPI?
[08:53:49] <ketchupicecream> Sadale: kidding. tried to make a joke about virginity
[08:53:51] <jessedesu2> No
[08:54:19] <amigojapan> jessedesu2: I think retroarch is the same thing as that for PC

[08:54:35] <jessedesu2> What is retroarch
[08:54:45] <ketchupicecream> emulation frontend
[08:54:51] <jessedesu2> Is it an os
[08:54:53] <Sadale> I find it funny how people are making a distro dedicated for emulating games. I mean you could just install a normal-ass linux and install the emulators on top of that manually
[08:55:04] <amigojapan> No
[08:55:07] <ketchupicecream> you can access emulator cores within it
[08:55:07] <Sadale> Or you could just create a script to install all those emulatorss
[08:55:10] <ketchupicecream> all in one place
[08:55:10] <jessedesu2> Saddle that's what I want
[08:55:28] <MootPoot> I want a script to get a waifu
[08:55:33] <ketchupicecream> Sadale: yeah and individual emulators are way better
[08:55:35] <Sadale> wait isn't retropiee an os?
[08:55:47] <MootPoot> retropee
[08:55:57] <Sadale> yes it is. It's a linux distro apparently.
[08:56:07] <Sadale> MootPoot, The e button on my keyboard seems to be broken :(
[08:57:03] <MootPoot> EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[08:57:16] <MootPoot> depending on the keyboard you can just replace the switch
[08:58:32] <Sadale> yeah I possibly can replace the switch.
[08:59:40] <Sadale> Something funny happened. I saw someone with a cute anime girl pic as avatar in a mastodon instance. He said "hi" in his first post. Then I replied "Your avatar's cute. I bet that you're a dude! :P"
[08:59:43] <Terminus> remap e to a different button. ü§£
[09:00:03] <Sadale> And then a SJW said "it's generally frowned upon to speculate on someone's gender simply by looking at their profile picture"
[09:00:09] <Sadale> dafaq?
[09:00:29] <Sadale> And the SJW isn't even the guy who said hi
[09:01:02] <Terminus> block the special snowflake. simple. 
[09:01:15] <MootPoot> I'm a snowflake
[09:01:17] <Sadale> yeah that could work
[09:01:20] <MootPoot> although not a special one
[09:01:22] <Sadale> Terminus, hewwo :3

[09:02:02] <Sadale> NO
[09:02:06] <MootPoot> turn her into a dude
[09:02:20] <amigojapan> Everyone is like a snow flake, completely different from each other yet similar
[09:02:28] <Sadale> Probably a better idee to buy her a strapon.
[09:02:29] <ketchupicecream> Sadale: everyone's a dude unless proven otherwise
[09:02:35] <Sadale> ketchupicecream, lol true
[09:02:58] <Sadale> ketchupicecream, actually that's the joke I was trying to make
[09:02:59] <Terminus> ah yes... we have watched Sadale grow from an teen who might have been innocent to a completely horny young man.
[09:03:06] <MootPoot> lol
[09:03:10] <Sadale> Terminus, what's wrong with that? :3
[09:03:19] <MootPoot> Sadale: sounds like you need to check to see if your imouto isen't a dude
[09:03:27] <Sadale> Terminus, yes I agree. I was rather innoocent :3
[09:03:31] <Terminus> Sadale: nothing's wrong with that but you still need to get laid. üòõ
[09:03:40] <MootPoot> what if Sadale's imouto is actually just trapping him
[09:03:42] <MootPoot> lolololol
[09:03:49] <ketchupicecream> Sadale: yeah that joke comes up every once in a while
[09:03:51] <Sadale> Terminus, NO. Unless it's with my imouto :3
[09:04:02] <MootPoot> what if I'm a trap
[09:04:23] <Sadale> I mean you're a dude
[09:04:25] <Terminus> Sadale: get your imouto to have sex with you.
[09:04:31] <Sadale> Terminus, I'll try :D
[09:04:34] <MootPoot> Sadale: how do you know I'm a dude
[09:04:43] <MootPoot> have you seen whats in my pants?
[09:04:45] <MootPoot> ecchi!
[09:04:50] <MootPoot> :3
[09:04:51] <Sadale> MootPoot, everyone's a dude on the internt unless proven otherwise
[09:05:07] <Sadale> MootPoot, And you've got onaholes in the safe of yours
[09:05:12] <ketchupicecream> aka sendpics
[09:05:19] <Sadale> girls don't get onaholes. They get dildos :P

[09:05:52] <Sadale> Definitely not onaholes

[09:49:52] <MootPoot> excluding android and embedded
[09:50:19] <ketchupicecream> I think it's not my fault. Preliminiary searches show that its an amd driver issue
[09:50:40] <amigojapan> ketchupicecream: by "break" I think he means "failed at installing it
[09:50:52] <MootPoot> lol no
[09:50:57] <MootPoot> it broke after installing
[09:51:36] <MootPoot> by break I mean a critical part of the system was damaged or too far gone - only a reinstall would help
[09:51:50] <ketchupicecream> oh
[09:52:07] <ketchupicecream> i meant a bad update

[09:53:56] <MootPoot> I went to the gun store today
[09:54:10] <MootPoot> I saw a remington model 760 in 30-06 with a 4x on it
[09:54:13] <MootPoot> for 650
[09:54:20] <ButterNoodle> too much
[09:54:25] <ButterNoodle> 760s are garbo
[09:54:30] <MootPoot> rip
[09:54:38] <MootPoot> looked cool tho
[09:54:40] <ButterNoodle> 350 would be too much
[09:54:50] <ButterNoodle> if it had a $300 scope on it
[09:55:04] <MootPoot> lol
[09:55:24] <MootPoot> all I came back with was 2 more howa mags, some snap caps and a box of 45
[09:55:33] <ButterNoodle> rip
[09:55:40] <ButterNoodle> 45 be 60c per
[09:55:45] <MootPoot> dont ask how much I paid

[09:56:31] <ButterNoodle> borked 2 cisco aps.. they go in the garbo pile
[09:56:36] <MootPoot> I paid 48 usd cents per round
[09:56:42] <ButterNoodle> *not bad
[09:56:47] <MootPoot> american eagle fmj
[09:57:05] <ButterNoodle> close to $1 per here
[09:57:07] <ButterNoodle> iirc
[09:57:12] <ButterNoodle> bass pro prices
[09:57:16] <MootPoot> I think its  just fixed delivery contract that they have
[09:57:30] <MootPoot> so no matter what shortage is down there they end up delivering for a fixed price up here
[09:57:32] <MootPoot> something like that

[10:01:14] <jessedesu2> I'm pretty sure it is
[10:01:17] <ButterNoodle> just like saying if women didnt dress sexy they wouldnt get raped

[10:01:58] <ButterNoodle> ur wrong.. and it doesnt matter
[10:02:11] <jessedesu2> Yea ur wrong too
[10:02:16] <ButterNoodle> idk 
[10:02:21] <jessedesu2> Agree to disagree
[10:02:35] <ButterNoodle> the amount of violent crime in ur state alone suggests otherwise
[10:03:03] <jessedesu2> I never needed a gun
[10:03:06] <jessedesu2> Ever

[10:05:51] <ButterNoodle> yes stand out as targets.. those sexy women should be wearing burkas
[10:05:58] <ButterNoodle> maybe show a little less ankle
[10:06:28] <jessedesu2> I always blend in with the crowd and I know how to play dumb, so I'm a lot less likely to fear getting shot
[10:06:29] <ButterNoodle> *I keep bring that up because us fail to see the comparison of argument
[10:06:38] <MootPoot> the stats are a little unclear though - specifically the "defensinve gun uses per year" thing , afaik the definition of "defensive use" are pretty fast and loose, at least in that one paper

[11:08:55] <Sapphirus> Okay then.
[11:08:56] <MootPoot> if they dont want to shop in person, you can order online, its 2022
[11:09:10] <MootPoot> it costs like 10 bucks on top
[11:09:19] <Sapphirus> The UK lifted all of its mandates, so Quebec doubling down on its nonsense is an outlier.
[11:09:35] <Sapphirus> Ontario will likely do the same in the coming months
[11:09:45] <MootPoot> Transmission and spread is one thing, but the vaccine is still reducing the severity

[11:29:21] <Sapphirus> That will ensure there's no moral authority to even attempt to implement such nonsensical reforms.
[11:29:30] <MootPoot> my personal ideal would be something along the lines of a 100% government healthcare

[11:29:42] <Sapphirus> Which makes no sense.
[11:29:48] <MootPoot> I dont think everything is worth covering
[11:30:17] <MootPoot> should the government have to cover for the soccer mom's monthly botox injection?
[11:30:18] <Sapphirus> You cannot simultaneously have 100% government healthcare that isn't universal. Get real.
[11:30:55] <Sapphirus> Unless you want to deny the existence of a private system that would pop up alongside it, which again.. at this point, it's about a vendetta you have for certain groups of people.

[11:31:05] <MootPoot> > it's about a vendetta you have for certain groups of people.
[11:31:06] <MootPoot> proof?
[11:31:35] <Sapphirus> You want a 100% government healthcare system, which can discriminate who it provides healthcare towards.
[11:31:53] <Sapphirus> You've painted yourself into that corner.
[11:32:04] <Sapphirus> What motive would there be for that? Hmm, I wonder.
[11:32:20] <Sapphirus> Can it be you don't want certain groups of people to get access to healthcare? Hmm.
[11:32:25] <MootPoot> FTFY which can discriminate which healthcare procedures require additional payment
[11:33:04] <MootPoot> you still go to the govt to get the healthcare
[11:33:08] <MootPoot> no private company involved
[11:33:09] <Sapphirus> At that point you're just advocating for what we already have, but then that'd just be you moving the goalposts all the way to the starting line.

[12:01:01] <teus> MootPoot: west-europe has less of a wealth gap
[12:01:11] <Sapphirus> See, this is why I don't believe you actually understand what you're advocating for. re: healthcare
[12:01:17] <teus> but the gap is increasing, mass immigration amplifies it, and polarisation is on the rise
[12:01:26] <MootPoot> I'd limit it to a certain phase though
[12:01:31] <MootPoot> until you're 25 y/o
[12:01:39] <MootPoot> enough to get an education
[12:01:42] <MootPoot> pass on the rest
[12:01:48] <teus> USA isnt advanced enough to even think about universal income
[12:01:50] <Sapphirus> It's completely disconnected from your political compass.
[12:02:14] <teus> in EU its an idea but we gotta wait what real life results it brings
[12:02:17] <Sapphirus> Part of why it isn't cogent, I guess.
[12:02:24] <MootPoot> eh
[12:02:45] <teus> advertising universal income in USA is like talking about nude beaches in an islamic country, people simply arent ready for it
[12:02:55] <MootPoot> we've had UBI test programs with decent results
[12:03:09] <teus> usa society isnt ready for it
[12:03:12] <Sapphirus> I don't think anyone even knows the answer to how we're going to pay for it without printing money off.
[12:03:22] <MootPoot> inb4 burn the rich
[12:03:27] <teus> Sapphirus: I also have my doubts
[12:03:43] <MootPoot> but corporate tax would be what I'd point to
[12:03:45] <MootPoot> imo
[12:03:57] <MootPoot> UBI until you are old enough to stand up on your own
[12:04:12] <teus> dunno if thats needed MootPoot 
[12:04:17] <Sapphirus> teus, if someone could explain to me how it'd be paid for and not move the goalpost on universality, we wouldn't be having this conversation right now.
[12:04:32] <MootPoot> oh, that's what you're picking about
[12:04:33] <teus> in EU you can get thrown out by your parents at 18, and still get welfare/funding to live by yourself and go to university
[12:04:42] <MootPoot> yeah yeah, i guess its not UBI at that point
[12:04:46] <MootPoot> BI until you are 25
[12:04:47] <MootPoot> happy?
[12:05:15] <teus> Sapphirus: long story. keeping people out of poverty reduces plenty of other costs
[12:05:21] <MootPoot> ifixedit.jpeg
[12:05:32] <teus> but you have to weigh it against people being plain lazy and unwilling to work
[12:05:46] <MootPoot> teus: thats why I would lock it to age 25
[12:05:59] <MootPoot> you would have to work...but you'd have plenty of time to get ready
[12:06:04] <DunceCotus> Universal Basic Communism
[12:06:04] <teus> im not willing to think about UBI until the massive defrauding of our social system is somewhat mediated
[12:06:11] <Sapphirus> teus, can those net positives even outweigh the burden on the money supply to sustain itself for long enough?
[12:06:21] <teus> possibly
[12:06:23] <MootPoot> probably
[12:06:38] <Sapphirus> It all comes back down to how are we going to pay for it. I don't think printing more money off would necessarily be the answer
[12:06:40] <MootPoot> you have a entire careers worth of life to tax from and a dwindling birth rate
[12:06:47] <MootPoot> I think it can be pulled off
[12:06:54] <Sapphirus> Dwindling birth rate ain't such a bad thing.
[12:06:59] <MootPoot> yes, I agree
[12:07:01] <teus> we have people here who worked for 2 years and fetched unemployment benefits all of their lives... AND THEYLL STILL GET MORE RETIREMENT MONEY THAN MY DAD WHO RAN HIS OWN SHOP HIS WHOLE LIFE
[12:07:07] <MootPoot> but the point is we dont have that many kids to take care of
[12:07:22] <Sapphirus> teus, Not saying that the present system isn't broken. 
[12:07:55] <MootPoot> teus: sounds like your dad ran a very unprofitable business or he didnt do any retirement planning
[12:08:11] <Sapphirus> It very well is, but we could possibly break our money supply by devaluing our currencies with UBI.
[12:08:11] <MootPoot> afaik if you run a business retirement is your problem
[12:08:20] <teus> MootPoot: you have no idea what youre talking about
[12:08:20] <MootPoot> BI*
[12:08:29] <MootPoot> teus: might be different in the US
[12:08:31] <teus> my dad pays a fortune in taxes, and still has to pay for his own retirement
[12:08:40] <MootPoot> taxes are different then retirement funds...
[12:08:54] <teus> system is different here
[12:09:04] <DunceCotus> UBI should really be the start of a move away from money
[12:09:18] <DunceCotus> if things break well organise them differently
[12:09:18] <MootPoot> teus: how is it there?
[12:09:28] <MootPoot> afaik you have your personal 401k, and then your normal taxes
[12:09:30] * denza242 farts loudly
[12:09:35] <teus> no
[12:09:38] <denza242> yes
[12:09:41] *** Joins: treeman5 (~treeman5@user/treeman5)
[12:09:52] <teus> you pay taxes here, and the government pays your retirement every month
[12:10:09] <MootPoot> for business owners?
[12:10:12] <MootPoot> or for employees
[12:10:16] <teus> people on unemployment dont pay those taxes on their income, yet reap more retirement money than my dad who pays a fortune in taxes
[12:10:39] <teus> MootPoot: either
[12:10:51] <MootPoot> tbh if your dad "paid a fortune in taxes" he should have a even bigger fortune to keep to himself as retirement
[12:10:55] <MootPoot> unless he's been spending it somewhere
[12:11:01] <teus> not necessarily
[12:11:07] <MootPoot> your taxes scale with how much you make
[12:11:21] <teus> keep in mind
[12:11:34] <teus> the business itself pays taxes, plus my dad pays taxes on his income as well
[12:11:36] <teus> he pays taxes twice
[12:11:45] <MootPoot> and?
[12:11:54] <MootPoot> that all still scales with income
[12:11:55] <teus> and yet yet he'll get less retirement than a bum who contributed nothing
[12:12:14] <Sapphirus> teus, there's one thing I'd support, and that is increasing the tax rate on the rich to reduce the burden on the middle and lower classes.
[12:12:25] <Sapphirus> And when I'm talking rich, I'm not talking about someone making $100k/year.
[12:12:31] <teus> yeah
[12:12:40] <teus> EU is looking at a minimum corporate tax rate of 15%
[12:12:51] <MootPoot> teus: it seems like your dad is just getting social security - and the other person is getting a disability + social security
[12:12:55] <MootPoot> is that the case?
[12:13:01] <teus> no
[12:13:12] <teus> defrauding the unemployment system isnt the same as disabled
[12:13:13] <Sapphirus> What I wouldn't want to see with a 'tax the rich' type scheme is a lack of accountability.
[12:13:25] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: am I losing my mind
[12:13:29] <teus> disabled get money from healthcare, unemployed from the government
[12:13:44] <MootPoot> a person who makes enough money to "pay a fortune in taxes" should be able to have a decent 401k
[12:14:13] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, I think you are a bit.
[12:14:17] <teus> keep in mind, someone self-employed also has much bigger risks
[12:14:41] <MootPoot> I dont understand how your story is possible without significant mismanagement of finances
[12:14:49] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: what do you think
[12:14:50] <teus> i understand you dont get it
[12:15:02] <teus> but theres no mismanagement involved, thats just how the system is here
[12:15:05] *** Quits: DunceCotus (~DunceCotu@user/duncecotus) (Remote host closed the connection)
[12:15:06] <Sapphirus> I fully understand what eus is saying. 
[12:15:30] *** Joins: DunceCotus (~DunceCotu@user/duncecotus)
[12:15:38] <Sapphirus> His father is self-employed, retired, and the government is double dipping through two separate tiers of tax bureaucracy.
[12:15:42] <Sapphirus> Am I wrong, teus?
[12:15:43] <teus> just take my word for it, my dad pays a fortune in taxes, and someone unemployed for 40 years will reap more retirement every month from the government
[12:15:53] <teus> Sapphirus: my dad aint retired yet
[12:15:56] <teus> but yes, you get it
[12:16:01] <MootPoot> I understand the elements
[12:16:08] <MootPoot> what I dont undertand is 
[12:16:09] <MootPoot> >and someone unemployed for 40 years will reap more retirement every month from the government
[12:16:11] <MootPoot> that part
[12:16:18] <teus> same way a single person living alone, pays A LOT MORE taxes than anyone living together, or with a family
[12:16:56] <MootPoot> Is it really possible for a person who worked their entire life in a productive, profitable self-employement to have less money for retirement then a unemployed person?
[12:17:20] <Terminus> yes. durrr...
[12:17:32] <teus> MootPoot: you stay at home your whole life or run your own business, you get basically nothing when you retire. you have a job, you get sufficient retirement funds every month. youre unemployed for 40 years, you get a reasonable retirement
[12:17:40] <MootPoot> you'd have your 401k to contribute to, and you'd have social security as well plus your addtional investmets
[12:17:43] <teus> MootPoot: im talking about what the government pays you
[12:17:47] <teus> we dont have 401K's here
[12:17:47] <MootPoot> ahhhhh
[12:17:53] <MootPoot> wait, you live in the US?
[12:17:55] <teus> no
[12:18:00] <MootPoot> oh
[12:18:11] <teus> europe
[12:18:12] <Terminus> just inherit a few million while never having worked a day in your life.
[12:18:13] <MootPoot> you were talking about the US earlier so I thought you were from there
[12:18:14] <MootPoot> then idk
[12:18:31] <teus> indeed
[12:18:36] <teus> different system
[12:18:51] <teus> we got much more advanced social coverage, but theres massive defrauding
[12:18:54] <MootPoot> I thought by different system you meant "I live in the US but your live in canada"
[12:18:57] <Sapphirus> From what I can infer, is that the government payout is based on income earned.
[12:18:59] <MootPoot> kind of deal
[12:19:05] <teus> Sapphirus: indeed
[12:19:13] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: it was my bad - I was under the assumption that he was american this entire time
[12:19:13] <teus> same with unemployment benefits, based on your income

[12:21:57] <teus> thats the only way to put it. nobody is more corrupt than the socialists
[12:22:15] <MootPoot> I think everyone is corrupt if you give them a long enough leash
[12:22:16] <MootPoot> imo
[12:22:19] <teus> socialists party away the money, instead of investing into the future
[12:22:28] <MootPoot> sounds like capitalists
[12:22:45] <teus> no, capitalists here just redirect the money to the rich
[12:22:54] <MootPoot> who then party it away?
[12:22:57] <MootPoot> or, well
[12:22:59] <MootPoot> stash it
[12:23:06] <Sapphirus> capitalists on the extreme are just corporate socialists

[12:23:23] <MootPoot> remember kids
[12:23:28] <teus> partying away the money? excessive benefits with no regard for its effectiveness, or abuse
[12:23:30] <MootPoot> extreme capitalism comes full circle 
[12:23:45] <teus> stuff like the belgian railways
[12:24:16] <teus> employing countless people who have nothing to do, yet are fiscally impossible to fire
[12:24:19] <MootPoot> aside from importing more people I honestly dont know what the fix is to any of this
[12:24:36] <teus> the belgian airways company was the same, they just bankrupted it and started again with a clean sheet
[12:24:41] <teus> same shoudl go for the railways
[12:25:16] <teus> MootPoot: once the government employs you here on a permanent basis, its almost impossible for them to fire you

[12:25:35] * MootPoot flies over to belgium
[12:25:55] <teus> and not being able to fire anyone who misbehaves
[12:26:32] <teus> once you have tenure with the government, they cant even fire you if youre asleep the whole day
[12:26:39] <MootPoot> awesome
[12:26:41] <MootPoot> sign me up
[12:26:57] <MootPoot> does it pay well
[12:26:58] <teus> a friend worked as consultant for the belgian railways
[12:27:00] <teus> YES
[12:27:09] <teus> massive benefits, lots of vacation, and MASSIVE retirement
[12:27:19] <MootPoot> DAMN
[12:27:22] <MootPoot> what's the problem then
[12:27:25] <MootPoot> sign me up
[12:27:30] <teus> at the railways they were making competence sheets for the staffers. some staffers only skill was "making coffee"
[12:27:31] <Sapphirus> you aren't euro
[12:27:44] <Sapphirus> oh my god
[12:28:02] <teus> someone had so little to do at the train station, he set up a chair and mirror in a spare room, and friends/family came by during office hours to get a haircut from him
[12:28:05] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: I'll eat a little bagutte, learn a little french, and I'm good to go :3
[12:28:36] <MootPoot> think of it this way

[12:29:05] <MootPoot> while getting paid 
[12:29:10] <teus> the government introduced it in the 70s-80s
[12:29:24] <teus> so now were waiting for those generations to retire, so we can restructure
[12:29:40] <teus> and such tenure is getting abolished
[12:29:51] <MootPoot> whaa
[12:29:56] <MootPoot> :(
[12:30:08] <teus> pretty awesome, hordes of unskilled useless staffers you cant fire, and just have to wait until they retire
[12:30:10] <MootPoot> was it unsustainable?
[12:30:17] <teus> of course
[12:30:28] <MootPoot> are you suuuuuuuuuuure?
[12:30:43] <teus> if the railways hired 4 new mechanics, they would hire 1 new office worker "to handle the extra administration work"
[12:30:44] <DunceCotus> Useless staffer-eaters
[12:31:16] <MootPoot> teus: is it unsustainable in your view or did the govt directly say it was unsustainable
[12:31:33] <teus> everyone just knows
[12:31:37] <MootPoot> ....
[12:31:46] <MootPoot> pass
[12:32:05] <teus> now were seeing more proactive behaviour
[12:32:08] <MootPoot> everyone "just knows" social security will collapse in the US since the 80s
[12:32:21] <teus> low-income or at-risk people get social housing, at a fraction fo the cost
[12:32:34] <teus> now were sending detectives out to figure out abuse of the system
[12:32:47] <MootPoot> wonder if we could fix our problems by reducing the cost to live
[12:32:50] <teus> people who are "broke" in belgium, getting social housing, but apparently they own real estate abroad
[12:32:54] <MootPoot> as in - returning to communal living
[12:33:08] <teus> thats a pipe dream
[12:33:14] <DunceCotus> MootPoot: there's a whole discourse about that - communism
[12:33:15] <MootPoot> get rid of the one person/ one family per house model
[12:33:20] <MootPoot> DunceCotus: ??????????
[12:33:30] <DunceCotus> Return 2 Communism
[12:33:36] <MootPoot> I'm not a social person but I can get behind communal living
[12:33:41] <MootPoot> how is communal living  = communism
[12:33:53] <DunceCotus> that's the whole point
[12:33:55] <MootPoot> its literally just living in a group home kind of deal
[12:33:59] <MootPoot> there is no state control
[12:34:07] <DunceCotus> MootPoot: you don't want to live in a group home

[12:34:54] <DunceCotus> I think move away from families altogether

[12:35:02] <teus> now you live closely together with all these trash people
[12:35:06] <teus> or their annoying offspring
[12:35:06] <DunceCotus> and towards affiliation
[12:35:07] <MootPoot> walkable smaller cities with group living and more open/ collaberative spaces
[12:35:16] <MootPoot> smaller homes = spend more time outside
[12:35:20] <teus> yeah i have one project nearby like that
[12:35:24] <teus> its a communist nightmare
[12:35:38] <MootPoot> I dont understand how its communist though
[12:35:43] <teus> give it 10-20 years and it'll be a ghetto
[12:35:43] <DunceCotus> projects, the
[12:35:53] <teus> MootPoot: communist building style
[12:35:58] <DunceCotus> housing projects in capitalism != communism
[12:36:02] <MootPoot> ^
[12:36:08] <DunceCotus> communism means a dissolution of family, state, money
[12:36:08] <MootPoot> its just a change in the format of the housing
[12:36:17] <MootPoot> you still have family, state and money
[12:36:18] <teus> DunceCotus: it just looks communist
[12:36:20] <teus> and bleak
[12:36:27] <DunceCotus> teus: soviet bloc?
[12:36:34] <DunceCotus> yeah I am not a fan of that sheeeit
[12:36:38] <teus> yeah, that kinda vibe
[12:36:42] <MootPoot> you can make it look nice, I dont see how its a criticism of the idea
[12:36:50] <DunceCotus> its SO ANNOYING to live really close to others
[12:36:55] <Sadale> nya~ :3
[12:36:57] <DunceCotus> especially if you're not close to them
[12:37:01] <teus> it is
[12:37:06] <DunceCotus> socially close that is
[12:37:07] <MootPoot> it is
[12:37:08] <teus> i hate living so close to people
[12:37:12] <MootPoot> but I think we have to do it
[12:37:26] <teus> my place was pretty much OK, but then trash people moved in all around me, and covid hit
[12:37:26] <DunceCotus> MootPoot: well no
[12:37:28] <MootPoot> to avoid the social tearing we have right now
[12:37:34] <DunceCotus> there's tonnes of land out there
[12:37:40] <MootPoot> and rampant resource consumption to live alone
[12:37:41] <DunceCotus> being sat on by investors
[12:37:46] <DunceCotus> and corps
[12:37:48] <MootPoot> DunceCotus: that dosen't solve the resource problem
[12:37:55] <DunceCotus> what resource problem?
[12:38:02] <MootPoot> overconsumption
[12:38:21] <DunceCotus> we are not over-consuming
[12:38:32] <DunceCotus> its just how production and distribution has been organised
[12:39:04] <MootPoot> sure, you can look at like that
[12:39:17] <MootPoot> but living communally would solve a lot of problems imo
[12:39:22] <MootPoot> would be rough to start with
[12:39:29] <teus> well
[12:39:29] <MootPoot> you'd still need private spaces
[12:39:33] <teus> you'd have people move out of the cities?
[12:39:54] <MootPoot> teus: I'm imagining more like dorm-style buildings are regular living areas

[13:04:02] <emmeka> it's the city's fault for zoning laws and the developer's fault for building low-density housing because it's more profitable in terms of return to the dollar invested

[13:06:46] <MootPoot> I'm not advocating for SROs as the poor people only home - I'm saying make most people who live in a city live in a SRO 
[13:06:49] <emmeka> population density of apartment blocks is sufficient, really, we just need way more geared to income public housing.
[13:06:50] <DunceCotus> such that concept of 'family' dissolves
[13:06:52] <MootPoot> unless they have family
[13:07:04] <MootPoot> in which case they get apartments
[13:07:08] <S_T_A_N> emmeka gets it
[13:07:29] <MootPoot> emmeka: something like the singapore model
[13:07:36] <emmeka> most public housing has either been sold off or demolished and the available stock of it is really low, especially compared to a lot of Europe.
[13:07:38] <MootPoot> where they kind of force social cohesion
[13:07:40] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: people are currently economically or socially required to stick with their family units

[13:08:42] <MootPoot> and the way it is setup encourages communal contact
[13:08:46] <emmeka> MootPoot anyway this is a bad policy and doesn't really solve anything, people are allowed to have full apartments even as urbanites. you just get tiny ones in a big tall building, a boring little box in the sky.

[13:12:14] <emmeka> MootPoot the density of high-rises is sufficient and cramming everyone into SROs to be miserable isn't necessary, the issue is more that development has focused on building ~luxury~ condos or low-density housing, and absolutely nothing else, because that's what's profitable.
[13:12:15] <MootPoot> emmeka:  would it be possible to zone it such that these places are not only for the poor?
[13:12:20] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I am not saying let us destroy the love we experience with our family members, only that people shouldn't be forced to stay with their family (or in families) due to social, political, economic etc. reasons
[13:12:30] <emmeka> MootPoot that would be ideal.
[13:12:40] <MootPoot> something like zone only for middle and low income
[13:12:42] <emmeka> but probably difficult

[13:19:23] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: with a system of free movement people would not need to stay in toxic living arrangemnets
[13:19:24] <MootPoot> but how would that accomodate larger groups?
[13:19:27] <MootPoot> families*
[13:19:28] <emmeka> easily?
[13:19:43] <emmeka> they are buildings which contain apartments
[13:19:48] <S_T_A_N> How is that a question?
[13:19:48] <MootPoot> say you have your shopping street- completely walkable
[13:19:52] <MootPoot> oh wiat
[13:19:56] <MootPoot> you want the TALL ones
[13:19:58] <MootPoot> okay
[13:20:01] <MootPoot> I geddit
[13:20:25] <MootPoot> so all within one building you have commercial at the bottom, and a mix of smaller and larger apartments at the top
[13:20:27] <emmeka> generally. I mean you think of this you probably picture the 19th century low-rises with a shop front and maybe 2-3 floors of apartments
[13:20:28] <MootPoot> middle and top
[13:20:51] <emmeka> but modern day mixed-use buildings are frequently high-rises dozens of stories tall
[13:20:59] <MootPoot> emmeka: yeah, thats how I was thinking where the room for familes are
[13:21:13] <MootPoot> I've seen those buildings, only enough for singles or dues
[13:21:24] <MootPoot> but we have a few of those mega mixed use high rises
[13:21:27] <MootPoot> never been in them tho
[13:21:49] <MootPoot> sure, that could work
[13:21:54] <MootPoot> I support this idea
[13:22:07] * MootPoot gives 500 exp to emmeka 
[13:22:08] <S_T_A_N> MootPoot gets it. Finally
[13:22:17] <emmeka> congrats on discovering new urbanism as a concept
[13:22:27] <MootPoot> I mean, you're pretty shit at explaining or contributing S_T_A_N

[13:22:34] *** JesseDesu__ is now known as JesseDesu
[13:22:40] <emmeka> you should occasionally engage with the idea that the things you're thinking big thoughts about have already been thought through by others
[13:22:54] <MootPoot> true
[13:22:58] <MootPoot> but I dont have a name for them
[13:23:04] <MootPoot> so best I can do is describe what the idea is
[13:23:10] <JesseDesu> !seen butternoodle
[13:23:10] <ImoutoBot> JesseDesu: butternoodle was last seen in ##anime 3 hours and 5 minutes ago: <ButterNoodle> I wont shop there
[13:23:24] <JesseDesu> i'm watching akebi's sailor uniform
[13:23:26] <JesseDesu> ep 3
[13:23:31] <DunceCotus> perhaps we could at least guarantee dorms for everyone
[13:23:36] <S_T_A_N> MootPoot: that's why I kept pointing to emmeka who is clearly better at it than I
[13:23:39] <DunceCotus> in the transition phase of anarcho-communism
[13:24:04] <DunceCotus> it would put an end to homelessness
[13:24:10] <S_T_A_N> No. keep the anarchy going until dorms are not a thing
[13:24:12] <DunceCotus> guaranteed dwellings
[13:24:26] <DunceCotus> S_T_A_N: well that's the idea
[13:24:30] <DunceCotus> the dorms are just a start
[13:24:43] <MootPoot> every time I look at those giant multi use buildings all I can think of is that they are for the uber rich people
[13:24:43] <S_T_A_N> Don't need to start there
[13:24:49] <MootPoot> and none of us normies live there

[13:24:57] <DunceCotus> S_T_A_N: okay
[13:25:06] <S_T_A_N> MootPoot: a lot are built that way because capitalism is evil like that
[13:25:35] <S_T_A_N> MootPoot: I am living in one though that was built entirely for affordable housing 
[13:25:37] <emmeka> MootPoot well at present they are built like that
[13:25:44] <emmeka> but that's because luxury housing is profitable
[13:25:50] <JesseDesu> anyone anyone
[13:26:05] <emmeka> they'd rather build fewer, larger more luxurious units and sell them for more than build small affordable units and sell for less

[14:02:26] <MootPoot> you just said "im poor" when I told you to go buy one
[14:02:30] <S_T_A_N> yes
[14:02:43] <S_T_A_N> I can't afford p90 
[14:02:47] <MootPoot> the implication meaning "I'm too poor to afford a gun"
[14:02:49] <MootPoot> oh
[14:02:50] <MootPoot> p90
[14:03:18] <MootPoot> ez get gun then
[14:03:30] <S_T_A_N> too poor for gun
[14:03:35] <Bco1981> that's not exactly your stand "gun" hand held firearms

[14:05:24] <amigojapan> Fuck electric bill is almost 90usd!
[14:05:27] <S_T_A_N> well it's the perfect gun and getting anything less than perfect is bad
[14:05:37] <MootPoot> how is it perfect 
[14:05:57] <S_T_A_N> lol amigojapan my old place I would have $150 bills. Sometimes close to $20
[14:05:59] <S_T_A_N> 200
[14:05:59] <MootPoot> its pretty meh for anything aside from cqb 
[14:06:03] <Bco1981> amigojapan: for 1 month ?
[14:06:12] <MootPoot> I get like 400 dollar bills, but that is electricity + heating
[14:06:15] <amigojapan> Yes Bco1981 
[14:06:27] <Bco1981> i get 550$ bills for 3 months
[14:06:47] <S_T_A_N> MootPoot: for US that includes heating too. wtf $400?
[14:07:01] <amigojapan> S_T_A_N: ButterNoodle and Nanobot hey like 600usd bills for one month
[14:07:02] <MootPoot> I do live in a full house
[14:07:03] <Bco1981> i don't have eletric heating
[14:07:07] <MootPoot> and I use a lot of electricity
[14:07:28] <S_T_A_N> smh
[14:07:49] <S_T_A_N> I can't wait to find out what my bills are gonna be here
[14:07:49] <Bco1981> MootPoot: kind of, electric heating...
[14:07:57] <MootPoot> well, I have gas heating
[14:08:02] <MootPoot> and a gas hot water tank
[14:08:10] <MootPoot> but electric stove and everything else
[14:08:20] <S_T_A_N> useally gas is on the same bill as electic so it's just one bill in my head
[14:08:41] <Bco1981> hm, you shouldn't mix those.
[14:08:52] <S_T_A_N> they always are here
[14:08:56] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I wonder if a resistive heater would spend less energy than a great pump. I think technology connections said heat pumps are the best
[14:09:07] <S_T_A_N> Though maybe not in the way you thinking
[14:09:24] <MootPoot> amigojapan: it'll use more
[14:09:36] <MootPoot> the resistive heater uses electricity to make heat
[14:09:39] <S_T_A_N> I am hoping for $50 bills here
[14:09:41] <MootPoot> the heat pump just moves heat around
[14:09:46] <MootPoot> easier to move around then make heat
[14:09:53] <amigojapan> :( MootPoot 
[14:09:54] <S_T_A_N> Heat Pumps are amazing

[14:58:00] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: I am mostly reluctant to learning them, because their syntax is so similar to C yet there are enough differences to trip you up and make your coding skills in the other language worse as well.
[14:58:15] <Urchin[emacs]> Ada even has some of the advantages of Haskell without weird math stuff

[16:20:37] <DunceCooties> teus: eh not really
[16:21:05] <DunceCooties> HubertFarnsworth: oh?
[16:21:09] <teus> or, well, a lot of doctors till stick to the old ones for -18, like zyrtec and benadryl
[16:21:13] <HubertFarnsworth> anti allergy? you mean histamines?
[16:21:19] <teus> yes

[16:23:23] <HubertFarnsworth> nyanpasu o/ amigojapan 
[16:23:24] <Matt|home> in this case, bleach sets me off.. urea sets me off.. and isopropyl

[17:02:24] <KatrinValerie> There is also gstreamer
[17:03:00] <KatrinValerie> I used to use gstreamer on my N900 to stream its cam to my PC and use it as a webcam through a videoloopback device
[17:03:07] <mixfix41> that would be beyond my knowledge. i only use gstreamer for rca to usb media. thats all i know about it.
[17:03:38] <KatrinValerie> mixfix41: I set it up to work both with usb network or wifi, was cool
[17:03:48] <KatrinValerie> basically turned my mobil phone into a surveillance cam

[18:21:06] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: its not actually
[18:21:18] <amigojapan> No ButterNoodle ?
[18:21:32] <ButterNoodle> *depends would be the best description
[18:21:43] <amigojapan> Ok
[18:22:04] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: what is now efficient?
[18:22:10] <ButterNoodle> they work -ok- down to freezing temps, but physics keeps them from working at any efficiency below that
[18:22:14] <amigojapan> More efficient*
[18:22:30] <amigojapan> I see
[18:22:56] <amigojapan> We had several under 0 days
[18:23:24] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: my last month electric bill was 90usd :(
[18:23:30] <ButterNoodle> the most efficient thing is geothermal heat/cool - dig a hole in the ground and put the condenser coil there.. always 60F/15C and keeps the refrigerant "regulated"
[18:23:33] <ButterNoodle> but
[18:23:47] <ButterNoodle> its a matter of what works in the application tbh
[18:24:03] <amigojapan> I see
[18:24:04] <ButterNoodle> for small apartment those mini splits are the best thing like u have
[18:24:10] <ButterNoodle> just because space
[18:24:19] <amigojapan> Right
[18:24:38] <amigojapan> But still expensive
[18:24:41] <ButterNoodle> idk if there is a natural gas option to put in an apartment
[18:24:51] <ButterNoodle> that is the cheapest heat
[18:24:57] <ButterNoodle> *and it feels hot
[18:25:24] <Miyukii> heat exchanger is only efficient with a temperature difference, like the geothermal ones
[18:25:34] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: there is, but the landlord won't approve it. Also gas is super expresive here
[18:25:50] <ButterNoodle> japan and fossil fuels...
[18:26:24] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: this area does not have had piping
[18:26:33] <amigojapan> Gas piping
[18:27:05] <Miyukii> Radiant heating panels are the most efficient for plain electric heating
[18:27:08] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: so we get gas canasters
[18:27:14] *** Joins: aHick (~memes@143.60.229.4)
[18:27:16] <ButterNoodle> Miyukii: u right.. I gave the short answer - geothermal use a loop of propylene glycol and use a heat exchanger to the "condenser coil" to move heat
[18:27:45] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: bottled NG or liquid propane is super expensive
[18:27:52] <Miyukii> No I meant it in reference to you
[18:28:03] <ButterNoodle> who?
[18:28:12] <amigojapan> I see ButterNoodle 
[18:28:16] <Miyukii> But what matters is just the efficiency in the end
[18:28:56] <Miyukii> a plain electric heater is practically 100%, a heat exchanger has losses
[18:29:10] <ButterNoodle> LP vs "city gas" is probably 3-4x different in cost
[18:29:14] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: we have propane in tanks here
[18:29:18] <Miyukii> Proper gas heaters got 130% or more
[18:29:25] <ButterNoodle> wut
[18:29:31] <ButterNoodle> 135?
[18:29:34] <ButterNoodle> 13%?
[18:29:37] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: I had city gas at my previous place
[18:29:41] <ButterNoodle> 13.5%
[18:30:13] <Miyukii> ButterNoodle: no, they use some heat exchange on the exhaust to get extra heat
[18:30:33] <ButterNoodle> !g 99% efficiency gas furnace

[18:31:21] <ButterNoodle> and u dont get %130 efficient.. u making up animals - where u gettin all that extra efficiency from? power over wireless?
[18:33:36] <Miyukii> Depends how you measure. For combustion the heat in exhaust fumes isn't normally counted as usable energy
[18:33:48] <Sadale> Miyukii, heewwo :3
[18:33:55] <Sadale> Miyukii, your nick name sounds cute to me xD
[18:34:08] <Miyukii> Lol, thanks
[18:34:12] <ButterNoodle> thats literally how efficiency is calculated
[18:34:42] <Miyukii> lower vs higher heating value
[18:35:45] <ButterNoodle> btu potential input -> btu out as usable heat through exchanger + btu in exhaust
[18:37:12] <ButterNoodle> anyway, amigojapan I'm looking to put 2 mini splits in the basement this summer to help offset the datacenter heat :|
[18:37:41] <amigojapan> Nice ButterNoodle 
[18:37:45] <ButterNoodle> the Mitsubishi units are nice with the variable speed compressors
[18:38:12] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: it seems city gas may be available now. It was not when I moved in
[18:38:40] <amigojapan> Ok time to go to sleep
[18:38:44] <ButterNoodle> if I run those to control the heat in the basement the larger unit will just need to cool the upstairs and probably save me a little monies

[19:53:05] <guest3452> aha
[19:53:07] <Urchin[emacs]> guest3452: is libera on the list there by default now, or did you have to fiddle?
[19:53:07] <ButterNoodle> how old
[19:53:10] <guest3452> im 21
[19:54:07] <guest3452> im assuming that people on irc usually older gen because idk if most people my 
[19:54:11] <guest3452> age would use this 
[19:54:13] <guest3452> but idk
[19:54:15] <Sadale> I think most users here are based in the US (like maybe 20-50%?). But you can find people coming from everywhere on the earth.
[19:54:35] <Sadale> Some people are older. Some younger. I'm in the 20s as well.
[19:55:12] <Sadale> You can find people in their 30s or 40s here. Some are even older
[19:55:33] <guest3452> damn well im in my 20's :)
[19:55:38] <Sadale> Oh. And some of them are real young like teenagers. But they aren't common
[19:55:48] <Sadale> Makes me wonder if Satin's still a teenager.
[19:56:03] <Sadale> Back when I first met her, she was a teenager.
[19:56:03] <Urchin[emacs]> IRC was originally created in 1988, so most people are younger than IRC
[19:56:06] <Sadale> so was I
[19:56:16] <Bco1981> i think she said she was in her 20's
[19:56:19] <Urchin[emacs]> probably
[19:56:55] <Satin> what
[19:56:58] <Urchin[emacs]> Sadale: Satin is in uni for a while now, so no
[19:57:00] <Satin> was i pinged
[19:57:09] <Bco1981> *gaps*
[19:57:12] <Sadale> Satin, yep. I was thinking if you're still a teenager.
[19:57:23] <Sadale> Satin, A new user joined. guest3452. He asked about the user age of the users here.
[19:57:43] <Sadale> like the demographic of the age range
[19:57:53] <Satin> im 22
[19:57:58] <Satin> ive been here since i was 14
[19:58:38] <Satin> about to attend my first mental health appointment
[19:59:00] <Sadale> guest3452, A few users had made fun of me that back when they first met me here, I was a cute an innocent boy. Now that I've turned into a filthy lewd man. :(
[19:59:10] <Satin> Sadale: bad
[19:59:14] <Sadale> xD
[19:59:19] <Satin> where's old sad ale gone!
[19:59:21] <Sadale> I've reached the point of no return xD
[19:59:23] <guest3452> damn 
[19:59:23] <Satin> poop jokes
[19:59:39] <Sadale> lol poop jokes ain't lewd. But I have been making them since like forever
[19:59:44] <Satin> instead of lewd jokes

[22:06:32] <Cryowolf> KuudereNoises, yeah. The company in Japan didn't understand that people were watching a person being a character. Not a character, scripted etc
[22:06:39] <Cryowolf> like in anime

[23:25:18] <Bco1981> they sure have removed a lot
[23:28:02] <KuudereNoises> Bco1981: even as someone who doesn't watch much EN minecraft, the lack of waterfalls makes it look so weird
[23:28:05] <KuudereNoises> around ame's house
[23:28:22] <Bco1981> yeah :)
[23:28:23] <MootPoot> somebody should make a yuri API for KuudereNoises and Urchin[emacs] so they can just call yuri on demand
[23:28:47] <KuudereNoises> MootPoot: I'm sure other people would use it too
[23:29:12] <KuudereNoises> this is official yuri week afterall
[23:29:21] <MootPoot> Bco1981: adding the power bank strap although it adds weight REALLY makes the headset less tiring to wear
[23:29:22] <MootPoot> it is?
[23:29:31] <MootPoot> I'm sorry I dont know any women
[23:29:36] <MootPoot> I can yuri with
[23:29:42] <Bco1981> MootPoot: hm interesting.
[23:30:09] <MootPoot> Bco1981: it also prevents me from having to readjust constantly or pull it down on my face
[23:30:23] <MootPoot> or wear it super tight
[23:30:31] <Bco1981> i wonder how much weight difference there is on the quest2 and the cv1. 
[23:30:42] <MootPoot> well, the quest 2 is about 500g
[23:30:44] <MootPoot> afaik
[23:31:00] <MootPoot> in its stock configuration, I have a aftermarket strap on so its more like 600 
[23:31:10] <MootPoot> then add 300-400 for the battery and strap
[23:31:20] <Bco1981> google says cv1: 470 g (1.04 lb)
[23:31:36] <Bco1981> you need to buff up that neck.
[23:31:43] <MootPoot> its not a neck problem
[23:31:49] <MootPoot> my neck can take it
[23:31:51] <MootPoot> its the face
[23:32:03] <MootPoot> having that pressure around your eyes constantly
[23:32:13] <MootPoot> back battery removes the pressure
[23:32:20] <Bco1981> wasn't the front weight a problem for your neck ?
[23:32:24] <MootPoot> face*
[23:32:43] <MootPoot> I mean, it does make it easier to swing around
[23:32:49] <MootPoot> but the problem was the eye pressure
[23:32:53] <MootPoot> not the neck strain
[23:32:53] <Bco1981> ah okay
[23:34:11] <MootPoot> I had a 1 hour interview just now with a company
[23:34:13] <MootPoot> on my m1 mac
[23:34:17] <MootPoot> thing was dying
[23:34:20] <MootPoot> gpu at 100%
[23:34:30] <MootPoot> maybe MS teams on the browser isen't the best
[23:34:36] <MootPoot> even though my browser was natively compiled
[23:35:57] <MootPoot> idk - m1 has been lagging for me 
[23:36:00] <MootPoot> dont know why
[23:36:09] <MootPoot> might be the 8g of ram
