[20:14:42] <guifa> Yeah.  When installing a module, the resources aren't stored with the same names/structure that you see.  I'd love for us to get to a point that resources are fully introspectable (e.g. list all the files in a directory) but I don't think that's been a priority since, presumably, module authors should know exactly what resources they have
[20:16:40] <clarkema> Yeah, I know I control the resources directory and could just add the file and charge ahead, but the error message when it's missing is very non-obvious and I prefer not leaving landmines lying around for my future-self's foot
[20:21:51] <guifa> instead of `if %?RESOURCES<foo>.IO ~~ Slip { … }`, perhaps you could consider a define `sub resource (Str $file) { given %?RESOURCES{$file} { when Slip { die "File $file not located in resources. Maybe you should add it?" }; default { .return } } }`
[20:22:33] <guifa> obviously, modifying the result of a non-existent file based on your needs
[20:27:04] <clarkema> Looks like that's going to be the best approach, thanks :)

[21:22:34] <ugexe> in what case would a file listed in %?RESOURCES not exist?
[21:23:31] <lizmat> when it got deleted at some point after installation ?
[21:23:52] <clarkema> or a typo during development
[21:24:30] <ugexe> it makes me sad we continue to treat %?RESOURCES as a file when it could be any type of io source

[21:26:39] <clarkema> such as?
[21:26:48] <ugexe> a socket
[21:28:37] <clarkema> what would be the benefit vs the socket API?
[21:29:11] <ugexe> well, uh, you could use a socket

[21:32:09] <ugexe> CompUnit::Repository::[Tar|Github] dont load code off the filesystem (well ::Tar does, but it streams the bytes out of the file, they don't go to an actual file somewhere first)
[21:33:28] <ugexe> when you hard couple %?RESOURCES to being a file path your code can't work with those things
[21:34:14] <clarkema> sure, but then there should be some equally generic way of signalling 'there are no bytes at this named place'
[21:34:20] <ugexe> same with a theoretical CompUnit::Repository::FatPack::PureRaku
[21:34:56] <clarkema> Especially if you're not using; if you're streaming resources from the network then then chances of failure are way higher than loading a file that 'should' be known good in the resources directory
[21:35:05] <clarkema> s/not using/& files/
[21:35:22] <ugexe> I'd probably check $?DISTRIBUTION.content('resources/name-of-file').slurp
[21:36:01] <ugexe> maybe %?RESOURCES<whatever>.slurp will work without the .IO
[21:36:13] <ugexe> in which case that is equally ok
[21:36:46] <ugexe> $?DISTRIBUTION.content('resources/name-of-file').open.slurp rather
