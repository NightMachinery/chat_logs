[01:03:55] <neiluj> Hello! Not sure if this select in a for loop will miss out the value in this attempt at an exponential backoff: https://bpa.st/M7IQ
[01:07:05] <bpalmer> you have a single case in your select, so it will always block until a value is sent over the channel
[01:08:35] <neiluj> thanks, I was hoping to get rid of this blocking call in order to retry if the value isn't returned after some duration.
[01:09:08] <ikke> You'd need to add a timer to the select as well
[01:09:22] <bpalmer> you need to use a multi-arm select statement for that.  limit := time.After(5*time.Second) ; select { case out := <-v: ...   case <-limit: ... }
[01:10:34] <bpalmer> that will block until a value comes over the v channel, or until 5 seconds pass. If a value comes in at exactly 5 seconds, the case will be selected randomly.
[01:10:44] <b0nn> Yeah - that code is going to block, maybe for days, until it reads something from the v channel, and then it will check if a timeout has occurred
[01:10:53] <neiluj> Thanks! The default case with the exponential backoff in it would work as well?
[01:11:15] <bpalmer> neiluj: you'd have to show code; the simple way with a default case will turn that into a busy loop.
[01:11:26] <bpalmer> not an exponential backoff.
[01:11:57] <neiluj> oh yeah, it's not gonna work, it'll prevent from reading the other channel
[01:12:29] <neiluj> Thanks! It is really clean to select on a timer!

[02:32:05] <siXy> KirkMcDonald: In theory yeah but most people just use the default as it's pretty damn good.
[02:32:52] <b0nn> KirkMcDonald: The article talks about using several GCs at different points in the lifecycle of the, hmm, heap? object?
[02:34:11] <b0nn> I wonder how Ruby/Python/etc GC compares (not so much in performance, more in terms of complexity)
[02:35:25] <b0nn> siXy: show me how to do pointer arithmetic in Go
[02:35:26] <KirkMcDonald> Python's GC is reasonably straightforward.
[02:35:39] <KirkMcDonald> CPython's, I should say.
[02:36:05] <KirkMcDonald> It primarily uses reference counting, and then it has a generational mark-and-sweep GC to handle cycles.
[02:36:13] <siXy> b0nn: You *can* using unsafe, but the fact that the language doesn't want you to do arithmetic with them doesn't make the point you think it makes.

[02:40:47] <siXy> e.g. in go you can do ptr := *[32]int, then (with unsafe) use that to reach inside your int array. As far as I'm aware that's not possible with java references, though admittedly it's been a few years since I needed to write java.
[02:42:34] *** Joins: sav_ (~savio@177.12.48.155)
[02:42:45] <b0nn> I mean, that's twice you've reached for *unsafe* when I was talking about pointers themselves
[02:43:13] <siXy> you're saying "reached for unsafe" like it somehow isn't in the language?
[02:43:22] <b0nn> And you also seem to think that it's an exact match java references are exactly Go's pointers
[02:43:56] <b0nn> So, if you don't understand the point,you can argue on your own.
[02:44:14] <b0nn> er, seem to think I was claiming it's an exact match
[02:45:57] <siXy> You really don't like being told you're wrong do you? wow. Okay, if you want a reason that doesn't involve unsafe - in go a pointer has to be exactly that - a single pointer, pointing at a specific address in memory. This is not true of java references.
[02:46:29] <b0nn> strike 3
[02:46:33] <siXy> Java references can be chained pointers with ref counters for GC tracking purposes - and in some implementations are
[02:46:36] <b0nn> can you not read?
[02:47:26] <siXy> so apart from the fact they have very little in common, they're the same. Okay. Got it, I guess?
[02:47:59] <b0nn> nothing at all.
[02:48:09] <b0nn> never been any comparison of the two *evr*
[02:48:29] <siXy> I've just pointed out a bunch of ways they are very different, and in response all you've done is whine about how I apparently can't read and you obviously meant that they're similar in some hidden way you don't want to explain.
[02:48:36] <b0nn> sure you have child
[02:48:40] <seebs> i'm confused
[02:48:59] <siXy> seebs: I don't think his ego can handle being wrong? It's all I've got at this point.
[02:49:08] <b0nn> and again with the personal stuff
[02:49:12] <seebs> Okay, so, there's "Java references", there's "C pointers", and there's "Go pointers"?
[02:49:24] <b0nn> and C++

[02:49:59] <b0nn> This is what he's riffing against 09:53 < b0nn> I mean, the pointers in Go, I think of them as closer to Java's reference than to C++'s
[02:50:10] <tar_xvf> if you could add some random java library that would do unsafe pointer arithmetic than they would behave the same, but golang intends to hide that dangerous behavior from the programmer. i think that's what i would say about this topic
[02:50:12] <b0nn> Somehow that means unsafe pointers
[02:50:16] <b0nn> somehow that means C
[02:50:31] <seebs> Yeah, I mean. I would also think of pointers in Go as more like references than like C pointers.
[02:50:34] <b0nn> and 10:14 < b0nn> er, seem to think I was claiming it's an exact match
[02:50:46] <KirkMcDonald> The comment appears to have been about C++ references.
[02:50:48] <seebs> You can do crazy shit with unsafe, but you shouldn't and can't reasonably expect it to work outside of specialized cases.
[02:50:59] <KirkMcDonald> Which are indeed a different thing from Java references. Or C pointers.
[02:51:07] <seebs> Yeah.
[02:51:38] <seebs> I don't know what Java references are like. I do note that in general, a pointer in Go is a pointer to one specific object and there's no language mechanism for repurposing it into a pointer to a different object, even an adjacent object.
[02:51:49] <siXy> Maybe that is what he meant? But I've lost interest in arguing with someone who responds like that ^ when questioned.
[02:51:54] <seebs> So I would not think that's very much like C pointers.
[02:51:54] <tar_xvf> wait, how are the three different from each other, other than that C is a more bare-bones version of the same concept??? I'm confused i think this is just arguing about semantics
[02:52:20] <seebs> If you have an array of ints in C, and you take the address of one of them, you're *allowed* to use it to reference the others.
[02:52:23] <KirkMcDonald> The key difference is that assigning to a C++ reference assigns to the thing referred to; you can't rebind the reference to refer to something else.
[02:52:30] <seebs> There's syntax for doing this, pointer arithmetic is defined, and so on.
[02:52:44] <seebs> If you have a pointer in Go, you have a pointer to a think and no promises that you can use it for anything else.
[02:52:46] <b0nn> References, unlike Go's pointers, aren't allow nil, though
[02:53:12] <seebs> Yeah. C++ references are even more-tightly-bound than Go pointers, so I guess in a way, Go pointers are sorta between them.
[02:53:32] <b0nn> Yeah, and in my mind I have them /closer/ to references than pointers
[02:54:41] <tar_xvf> so all this is like if you had two data types to describe an integer, if you had one which was just a string of bits that was read as the number in base 2, and another which was parsed as a sort of struct that would be read to figure out what number it is
[02:55:31] <tar_xvf> it's just a difference in how the compiler interprets the code and translates it
[02:55:47] <tar_xvf> wait, that's true of all programming languages

[03:31:45] <tar_xvf> What you could try is write a script in bash or shell that runs that and `echo`s the result, and then call `exec.Command("./scripthere").Output()`
[03:32:58] <tar_xvf> but in the future if you try to call other commands with exec.Command, what you need to do is seperate every argument (including arg0 which is the name of the command) as seperate string arguments `exec.Command("./script", "arg", "nextarg")` etc.
[03:33:13] <tar_xvf> And exec.Command doesn't handle pipes itself although you can take the .Output() and pipe it into another exec.Command
[03:35:37] <dntreou> tar_xvf:  I am still getting the same even if I pass this as you suggested command :=  "bash -c 'source /home/script.sh; env | grep unit'"

[03:36:53] <tar_xvf> dntreou: can you try making a seperate file, begin it with `#!/usr/bin/env bash` or similar if you are on windows or something, and save it as "script", chmod +x that file, then do `exec.Command("./script").Output()`
[03:37:33] <bpalmer> try an absolute path rather than ./ first, to cut down on one more thing that could go wrong
[03:37:36] <dntreou> you are absolutely right it worked

[20:10:36] <FUZxxl> if a module is not registered as a dependency, go build has no way to know which version of the module you want.

[21:29:35] <fizzie> It's in a different function. A call to t.Helper() just marks the current function as skippable, not the entire subtree below it. You'd need to call t.Helper() in `failed` too -- https://gotipplay.golang.org/p/bXveXzXSbJM prints "prog.go:11" as the location for the error.
[21:30:15] <cobber> yikes!

[21:35:04] <cobber> I guess when you read https://pkg.go.dev/testing#T.Helper exactly, that is what it says... just hard for me to image what they meant exactly.

[21:36:06] <siXy> cobber: the purpose of it - at least as I use it - is to skip specific setup functions - if it skipped everything after you called t.Helper() then the only reason I've ever used iut wouldn't work

[21:38:21] <cobber> siXy: I'm doing something similar to https://github.com/stretchr/testify - so I've got functions that call functions that at some point call t.Log and t.Error... but the thing being tested is a few frames up the stack from where t.Log is being called

[21:40:40] <siXy> *nod*. I had a poke at your example to see if I could find a sensible thing to do with your failed() function to avoid it showing up - but given that you're only really calling it when the assertion that ErrorReporter == tHelper fails, I can't see any obvious solution. But this is maybe a place where it's better to just panic?

[21:41:29] *** Joins: andlabs (~andlabs@70.107.171.168)
[21:41:45] <cobber> thanks but fizzie was spot on - just need to call t.Helper() in the failer() function and all is well.
[21:42:33] <cobber> PS: my package reports passed and failed tests, because "everything passed" is better than "nothing failed"
[21:43:47] <siXy> cobber: But you can't do that - because you're calling failed() when r doesn't have a Helper() method.
[21:44:37] <cobber> it does via the "if h, ok := r.(tHelper)" check
[21:44:59] <siXy> yeah, but if that check fails, then you call failed(r)
[21:45:03] <cobber> or it would if I added Helper() to the ErrorReporter interface
[21:45:27] <siXy> Oh, if you can alter that interface then yes, that would be much simpler.

[21:46:25] <cobber> see fzzie's playground - he just copied the "if helper" block down into the failed() function and it worked - r is just *testing.T hiding behind a minimal interface

[21:49:26] <siXy> I realise that. Anyway, it doesn't matter - changing ErrorReporter to have a Helper() method solves the problem much more elegantly anyway.
