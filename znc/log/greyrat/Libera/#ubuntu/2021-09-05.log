[02:28:21] <tomreyn> hmm i'm not sure that those can boot off usb. maybe they can, i just don't know.
[02:28:44] <rud0lf> i think you need to burn one time fuse in rpi for that
[02:28:54] <rud0lf> programtically
[02:29:06] <SJrX> But it is seemingly different from SDCard. I guess I did just find this post, which maybe says that Ubuntu 20.04 won't work this way _directly_ and that I could try Ubuntu 20.10 so I'm trying that right now: https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=295609
[02:29:23] <tomreyn> i see. i only remember that there were problems with usb booting related to otg mode
[02:30:04] <SJrX> I was expecting Ubuntu Server to require a USB to install the standard way, kind of surprised that it has these "preinstalled images".
[02:30:06] <rud0lf> SJrX: you can just keep sd card in, and mount / (root) from usb
[02:30:18] <rud0lf> you just need to set partition's uuid in cmdline.txt
[02:30:47] <rud0lf> so bootloader starts from sd, but rest is handled by ssd
[02:30:48] <tomreyn> SJrX: the 'special thing' making things more difficult here is not ubuntu ;)
[02:31:37] <SJrX> tomreyn, I didn't mean to slight ubuntu with that. I undrestand the RPi has some oddities.
[02:32:09] <SJrX> rud0lf, I didn't buy an sd card unfortunately.
[02:32:24] <SJrX> And I was hoping to build a RPi k8s cluster, so I don't want to go buy 6 SD Cards.

[03:11:14] <fmlatghor> I decided to just stick with resolv.conf
[03:11:34] <fmlatghor> It would probably be a good idea to learn systemd-resolved, except I don't want to spend the rest of the day doing that
[03:12:38] <coryc257> I know nothing about what your talking about but be aware sometimes systemd will overwrite config files so make sure that isn't one of them

[03:13:33] <coryc257> hahaha, hopefully that's enough

[06:11:28] <noarb> When installing ubuntu on a 2 monitor setup, is there a way to tell ubuntu to prefer a monitor and to rotate it? I have the same issues with grub details on boot when all the userland settings are correct

[06:27:59] <noarb> I haven't done anything before editing userland display settings after the machine has booted. Do I need to pass a boot param or something to get grub2 boot info on the right monitor and rotated correctly? I have a 2 monitor setup, 1 horizontal 1 vertical. Right now grub and installation are on the wrong monitor and rotated incorrectly

[08:57:03] <webchat60> and `pbuilder-dist focal build ../plymouth_0.9.4git20200323-0ubuntu6.dsc`. But it is not generating any deb file. The first command generated lots of `ignored for deletion` warning. and the second one generated `pbuilder dependency error`. I am where I went wrong.

[12:20:14] <pertho> with bumblebee, at least I could do: optirun glxgears and it would run on the nvidia discreete graphics card
[12:20:46] <lotuspsychje> pertho: you need nvidia-settings to pick performance mode or powersaving mode
[12:21:04] <bobdobbs> EriC^^: Yes, I did. I think I just accidently nuked it. However, that's ok. That was just a media bucket
[12:21:20] <bobdobbs> EriC^^: serves me right for not taking a breath and being careful
[12:21:30] <bobdobbs> EriC^^: I think I got off really lucky
[12:21:50] <bobdobbs> I'd forgotten how risky this stuff was
[12:22:33] <bobdobbs> I used to use an app called "toaster" it's main purpose was burning to CD and DVD's. I guess it doesn't exist anymore, cos nobody uses that old tech. But it was so easy to make bootable usb's with it.
[12:23:06] <tsapien> you could probably track it down somewhere
[12:24:22] <EriC^^> bobdobbs: hmm so you have backups of the stuff, no problem?

Probably because I remember that this used to be easy for me, and now I feel like I'm unfamiliar territory, so I feel like a clueless idiot.

[14:23:19] <Kolusion> How is it done from there on?
[14:23:47] <Kolusion> LVM rings a bell
[14:24:26] <Kolusion> I read it is done with rsync

[14:51:10] <tomreyn> for mysql, there's innobackupex which you can use to reate hot backups using binary logs, then do PIT recovery from those (to the same mysqld version only)
[14:51:21] <tomreyn> i assume something similar will exist for postgresql
[14:52:05] <Kolusion> PostgreSQL pg_dump can do this, but the problem is I want to backup file directories of web and mails at the same exact time.
[14:52:20] <Kolusion> So I need something that executes outside of it so it can snap all of them together.
[14:52:30] <tomreyn> but for anything serious you'd want a cluster, of course, and then you can have a read replica which you can take the backup from.
[14:52:58] <Kolusion> I don't have the infrastructure for that.
[14:53:06] <Kolusion> The server will be a desktop
[14:53:11] <Kolusion> laptop even
[14:53:43] <tomreyn> then why do you have this need for same-timed backups?
[14:54:19] <Kolusion> It's just better.
[14:54:26] <tomreyn> and why is stopping services a problem then?
[14:54:27] <Kolusion> Everything on the same level.
[14:54:50] <Kolusion> I will be running a website. It's going to look so shit if I have to stop everything every 24 hours lol
[14:55:31] <tomreyn> well either it's an important website, then you'll have proper infr, or it isnt, then it doesn't matter at all
[14:55:42] <Kolusion> That is a flawed outlook.
[14:56:01] <Kolusion> Also, having everything backed up at the same time makes backing up cleaner.
[14:56:05] <Kolusion> I mean restoring
[14:57:38] <Kolusion> There has got to be something that we don't know about.
[14:57:42] <Kolusion> I will go looking
[14:57:49] <tomreyn> i don't think you'll be able to combine "serious project, serious requirements" and "server runs on a (single) laptop".
[14:58:09] <Kolusion> A serious project can run on a laptop.
[14:58:20] <Kolusion> The laptop has nothing to do with this issue.
[14:58:30] <Kolusion> This is operating system level
[14:59:24] <tomreyn> good luck!
[14:59:45] <Kolusion> Maybe I could create two virtual machines and have them replicated, then when I need to do the backup, take one offline and do the backup there.

[16:22:13] <pertho> what is prime-offload?
[16:22:38] <pertho> these utils seem to be very poorly documented (nvidia-prime package)
[16:23:03] <lotuspsychje> pertho: PRIME render offload is the ability to have an X screen rendered by one GPU, but choose certain applications within that X screen to be rendered on a different GPU. This is particularly useful in combination with dynamic power management to leave an NVIDIA GPU powered off, except when it is needed to render select performance-sensitive applications.

[16:24:52] <pertho> I don't know what to do with this. Would be nice to have nvidia GPU rendering things... it'd take a load off the intel chipset/cpu

[16:27:17] <TJ-> pertho: long time since I messed with prime, but as you said the PC is circa-2012 I wonder if it is one of the early dual GPU systems that actually have a hardware multiplexer, rather than it done in software, in which case the current tools may indeed have a problem

[16:28:28] <TJ-> the hardware multiplexer as I recall can only switch which GPU writes to output, whereas with the so-called 'muxless' (no multiplexer) one GPU is responsible for the output but the other can do off-screen rendering and pass it through to the other GPU

[17:20:00] <Kolusion> tomreyn: I need to backup a live database.
[17:20:15] <ioria> pertho, sudo apt purge nvidia-driver-390
[17:20:17] <pertho> Kolusion: mysql? postgresql?
[17:20:25] <Kolusion> pertho: PostgreSQL
[17:20:54] <pertho> Kolusion: pg_dumpall will do what you want I believe
[17:20:58] <tomreyn> Kolusion: oh this is still about the 'snapshot backup', i told you what i think i know there already.
[17:21:10] <pertho> or if you use zfs you can stop postgresql, take a zfs snapshot, then start it back up
[17:21:19] <Kolusion> pertho: Yes, but I need the snapshot of the database at the same time of my web server files and mail server files.
[17:21:31] <Kolusion> pertho: Server can't be taken offline.
[17:21:51] <pertho> then you'll have to do pg_dumpall, and rsync the web/mail server files somewhere
[17:22:05] <pertho> ioria: OK gonna reboot brb :)
[17:22:11] <ioria> pertho, wait
[17:22:21] <ioria> pertho, sudo apt autopurge
[17:22:40] <CanisElSaviore> hmm.  I'm installing the newer vlc v4  I worked too long today to get my huion tablet just the way I want it on a multo monitor setup to let stupid vlc video window glitches stop me.
[17:22:46] <Kolusion> pertho: rsync doesn't freeze the source.
[17:23:12] <pertho> zfs snapshot would
[17:23:31] <Kolusion> pertho: rsync would also not be used at the same atomic time with pg_dumpall.
[17:23:43] <Kolusion> pertho: I don't have time to learn ZFS.
[17:24:02] <pertho> Kolusion: does the website change that frequently?
[17:24:22] <Kolusion> pertho: Not now it doesn't, but it may in future.
[17:24:35] <pertho> time to learn zfs then :) it's really handy
[17:24:39] <Kolusion> hahahahahaha
[17:24:42] <Kolusion> I'm sure it is.
[17:24:53] <pertho> if you want snapshots of the filesystem in time, zfs is the answer
[17:24:53] <Kolusion> I have a solution already, but was hoping for something easier than doing it.
[17:25:04] <pertho> I believe LVM does snapshotting too

[17:25:13] <pertho> but you need free space left over in the PE for it
[17:25:30] <Kolusion> pertho: Yeah, but I know a file volume method, but I only need a few directories and not the entire volume.
[17:25:44] <Kolusion> pertho: Yes, LVM is what I was talking about.
[17:26:10] <Kolusion> pertho: I will tell you the solution I already have. One moment while I find the tool name I need to explain it...

[17:34:23] <Kolusion> What I plan on doing is making a virtual machine with a database running, using lsyncd to keep the database files synced in real time, then I can shut down the database server in the virtual machine and backup the database there while the live server stays running. What do others think? Clunky? Effective?
