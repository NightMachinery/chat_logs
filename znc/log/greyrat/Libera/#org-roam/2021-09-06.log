[21:03:01] * factotvm I have a question about best practices and how to achieve the following goal:
[21:03:01] * factotvm - Documentation on a node and all its descendants, published via =ox-hugo= or =org-publish= or similar
[21:03:44] <factotvm> I have found several resources for publishing all of the org-roam-directory. But I'm interested in a subset.
[21:05:22] <factotvm> And those subsets will change over time and (e.g. these are "topics" and not "classes" like "home" and "work")
[21:05:41] * factotvm Context: I want to be able to write professional documentation and then spit it out for others to consume.
