We're working on getting it fixed as soon as we can.". I

[23:12:35] <gwozniak> I wonder what percentage of "major issue" bug reports come in to my team with only screenshots; no sample code, no dependency version info, no environment description, etc.
[23:13:26] <epilys> WONTFIX?
[23:13:52] <gwozniak> A recent one of these to me was the description "FPU code is totally broken!".  Turned out the customer didn't enable the FPU on the device properly
[23:14:20] <epilys> dear lord
[23:14:33] <gwozniak> This king of thing is common
[23:14:38] <gwozniak> *kind

[23:15:21] <epilys> I want to know company names :/
[23:15:40] <epilys> public shaming
[23:15:51] <gwozniak> I don't actually see those.  They come in through our support team and all that is hidden from us
[23:16:58] <gwozniak> At least the FPU one had reproduce case
[23:17:01] <epilys> management has thought it all out huh?
[23:17:17] <gwozniak> It's done deliberatly so that customers do not email us with questions
[23:17:38] <gwozniak> Otherwise, that would be all that we do
[23:17:57] <epilys> yeah but why hide the identities from you? it's private/confidential anyway
[23:18:25] <gwozniak> It's not pertinent to the issue in almost all cases
[23:18:49] <gwozniak> Sometimes a name slips through
[23:19:32] <epilys> it could hint it's a PEBCAK ticket if it's a repeat offender
[23:19:39] <gwozniak> Our support teams help customers understand the devices and occasionally help out with programming
[23:20:18] <epilys> is the documentation good? the customers might not be at fault
[23:20:22] <gwozniak> It doesn't matter if it's a PEBCAK ticket.  We're not going to reject it
[23:20:56] <epilys> yeah I mean it helps with debugging
[23:21:25] <gwozniak> We just say, "Please provide some sample code".  It finds its way there.  Just takes a while.
[23:21:47] <gwozniak> Still, it would be nice to avoid that unnecessary step
[23:23:50] <gwozniak> And to answer the documentation question, it's okay but could be better.  I do not know how much it gets read
