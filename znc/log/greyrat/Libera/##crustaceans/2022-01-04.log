[00:00:58] <imode> rainfall came yesterday instead of that 15 feet of snow.
[00:01:10] <imode> snow went to the mountain, rain came here. my entire apartment complex is flooded.
[00:01:15] <imode> glad I live on the 3rd floor.
[00:01:17] <manicennui> Nice.
[00:06:34] <riv> imode what's tying you down
[00:07:06] <riv> there's some strange graph based minimal computation models I never understood
[00:14:02] <manicennui> "Probably thinking how amazing it is that his son, that used to paint naked women on their car, ended up with a house in the hills and now this beautiful place."
[00:14:03] <manicennui> hah
[00:16:59] <imode> riv: family, wife, pets.
[00:25:24] <dminkovsky> 15 ft is a lot.
[00:25:28] <dminkovsky> we got a few inches
[00:26:06] <imode> we got dumped on for 7-8 inches the day after christmas and this latest downpour is poised to wipe it away.
[00:46:51] <Church> Lucky
[00:46:57] <Church> No snow yet

[01:16:46] <manicennui> hah
[01:16:59] <manicennui> I feel attacked
[01:20:20] <companion_cube> on my farm, the chicken will feed themselves
[01:20:31] <gwozniak> Ever seen chickens fight?
[01:20:36] <bkero> chickens++
[01:20:38] <companion_cube> "show HN: chicken auto-sustainance incentivization"
[01:20:39] <gwozniak> They are not friendly
[01:20:50] <companion_cube> heh, pecking order is a real thing, I hear
[01:20:50] <manicennui> Someone who actually has a small farm answered something like that: https://www.reddit.com/r/cottagecore/comments/rus9c7/comment/hr16t5v/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3
[01:20:51] <buttsbot> Tiny_Goats comments on Ain’t that the truth?
[01:21:00] <manicennui> "My chickens, ducks, and quail all have auto feeders."
[01:21:11] <manicennui> They talk about the other animals too.
[01:21:33] <manicennui> Last year I spent a few days on a farm in NC. The chickens were hilarious to watch.
[01:21:43] <manicennui> Several of the hens ran around wherever the rooster went.
[01:22:01] <Brekkjern> That Harry Potter reunion movie was pretty cool
[01:22:24] <gwozniak> The Harry Potter craze passed me by
[01:22:48] <gwozniak> I did see the movies, but I knew nothing of the books, aside from their existence
[01:23:01] <companion_cube> I read the first book when I was 11
[01:23:05] <companion_cube> I was in, for once!!!
[01:23:10] <Brekkjern> Hah
[01:23:17] <manicennui> I read the first book and saw the first movie. The book seemed decent for a kid's book, but neither made me want to consume more of the franchise.
[01:23:26] <Brekkjern> I can't remember when I read them, but I was in primary school at the time
[01:23:30] <gwozniak> I think it's because I was in my 20s when the first book was published
[01:23:34] <manicennui> I was in my 30s I think.
[01:23:43] <Brekkjern> IMO, the books are pretty good. They hold up to this day.
[01:24:05] <gwozniak> I read the first book a few years ago.  Definitely a kids thing, but it was alright
[01:24:13] <Brekkjern> It matures as the characters do
[01:24:16] <gwozniak> I have all the books and haven't read past the first
[01:24:39] <Brekkjern> The last ones become somewhat dark for kids novels
[01:25:03] <companion_cube> just like Pullman's books, I suppose. They're dark from the start though.
[01:25:05] <gwozniak> Also, it's clear the editor was less of an influence for the later books ;)
[01:25:18] <defect> i was 15 ish when the first came out i think. i read the first three and enjoyed them, but then i thought i was too cool for them
[01:25:21] <manicennui> Brekkjern: Kid's books were far darker before.
[01:25:28] <Brekkjern> manicennui: True
[01:25:35] * manicennui shakes his cane
[01:25:38] <defect> would definitely read with my kids if i have anby
[01:25:50] <Brekkjern> I wish childrens entertainment were "better" nowadays
[01:26:11] <manicennui> When I was growing up I was into Where The Red Fern Grows and The Indian In The Cupboard.
[01:26:31] <defect> what was "good" childrens entertainment in the 80s and 90s?
[01:26:43] <manicennui> defect: Jim Henson stuff.
[01:26:49] <manicennui> Neverending Story
[01:28:31] <gwozniak> Since my parents let me watch pretty much anything, it was Aliens and The Terminator for me
[01:28:40] <defect> hah
[01:28:53] <gwozniak> I remember watching Amadeus as a kid and not getting it
[01:29:14] <defect> what about blues clues and things like that? i guess that's more 00s? was it any good?
[01:29:23] <defect> i mostly grew up on swedish tv/movies
[01:29:26] <manicennui> I definitely saw all kinds of things.
[01:29:36] <manicennui> Not sure whether Gremlins is really for kids.
[01:29:44] <manicennui> We also had Pee Wee.
[01:29:53] <gwozniak> Gremlins was another favourite movie for me
[01:29:54] <manicennui> Earnest.
[01:30:06] <manicennui> Ernest
[01:30:35] <gwozniak> My friend and I chanted "Ernest Goes To Camp" over and over so that we could go see it instead of some church thing
[01:30:43] <manicennui> heh
[01:30:58] <gwozniak> I probably liked it just because I wasn't at church
[01:31:44] <defect> it'd be interesting to hear what parents of pre-teens/early teens want them to watch today
[01:31:52] <Church> Hmm.
[01:32:03] <Church> Veggietales
[01:34:42] <gwozniak> I honestly remember very little from the time before I was 8 or so
[01:35:25] <gwozniak> Once I got to be 9 or 10, I was kind of done with real "kiddie" stuff, but would still idly watch cartoons on Saturday morning
[01:38:15] <Brekkjern> Regardless of what kids are watching nowadays, I'm really happy for shows like Invincible, Castlevania and Arcane
[01:38:52] <Brekkjern> Love that there are actually mature stories being told using animation
[01:39:11] <manicennui> In the US.
[01:39:20] <manicennui> Have been for decades in Japan and France.
[01:39:26] <Brekkjern> Sure
[01:39:48] <Brekkjern> But those three are really good shows
[01:41:36] <manicennui> Venture Bros is also pretty old.

[05:36:31] <Church> Err, found guilty*
[05:38:50] <imode> good.
[05:40:05] <companion_cube> what's the difference?
[05:43:36] <cb> gaslight, gatekeep, girlboss
[05:44:40] <companion_cube> is conviction what follows being found guilty? like, deciding the exact penalty?
[05:47:02] <manicennui> They are synonymous AFAIK.
[05:47:15] <defect> companion_cube: that's sentencing, right?
[05:47:37] <manicennui> Yes, sentencing is deciding the penalty.
[05:48:55] <manicennui> Not sure why Church corrected themself.
[05:49:25] <manicennui> In law, a conviction is the verdict that usually results when a court of law finds a defendant guilty of a crime.[1] The opposite of a conviction is an acquittal (that is, "not guilty").
[05:50:11] <defect> so she was found guilty, and also convicted
[05:50:38] <companion_cube> can you be found guilty and then acquitted?
[05:50:47] <manicennui> companion_cube: On appeal.
[05:50:52] <companion_cube> oh I see.
[05:51:37] <manicennui> Judge can also vacate a verdict.
[05:52:14] <manicennui> Don't know the rules around that.
[05:54:12] <manicennui> Why were only a couple of people charged?
[05:54:29] <manicennui> Surely a larger group of people both knew and helped them perpetrate the fraud.
[05:54:37] <manicennui> Wouldn't doubt that an investor or two knew.
[05:54:42] <companion_cube> they kept the employees in the dark, it seems
[05:54:46] <companion_cube> heh

[05:55:22] <manicennui> How do you keep employees from realizing that something doesn't work?
[05:55:38] <companion_cube> you don't show them the big picture
[05:55:42] <manicennui> Including I assume dozens of employees who were research scientists.
[05:55:48] <companion_cube> some did realize it, and came out as whistleblowers
[05:55:54] <manicennui> Ah.
[05:55:57] <imode> yeah I don't buy the idea that everybody shut up about it.
[05:56:00] <companion_cube> there was also a lot of turnaround

[06:44:17] <dminkovsky> i'd fuck with a little douglas adams
[06:44:24] <dminkovsky> probably some fun reading
[06:45:34] <manicennui> I enjoyed HGTTG a lot.
[06:45:40] <dminkovsky> sorry that was said as crudely as possible
[06:45:41] <manicennui> But never read anything other than the first book.
[06:45:50] <dminkovsky> yeah i think i did too back in the day
[06:46:05] <manicennui> I always think about the dolphins leaving the planet.
[06:46:14] <manicennui> And want to believe that they really would if we fucked things up badly enough.
[06:46:16] <dminkovsky> i don't remember anything about it
[06:46:38] <imode> my brain is stuck in a loop.
[06:46:40] <dminkovsky> except that i enjoyed it
[06:46:47] <dminkovsky> your brain is stuck in a loop
[06:46:51] <dminkovsky> your brain is stuck in a loop
[06:46:54] <manicennui> The dolphins are the second most intelligent species on the planet Earth, only surpassed by mice, although many outside observers don't know about the mice. They long ago knew of Earth's planned destruction and tried to communicate this to humans who misinterpreted it as "amusing attempts to punch football or whistle for tidbits."[1] The last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a surprisingly sophisticated attempt to
[06:46:54] <manicennui> do a double backward somersault through a hoop while whistling the "Star Spangled Banner," but was, in fact, a message. The message was "so long, and thanks for all the fish.[1]
[06:48:27] <manicennui> "For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much—the wheel, New York, wars and so on—whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man—for precisely the same reasons.”
[06:49:35] <imode> so, I'm trying to build a machine model using associative memory concepts.
[06:49:56] *** Quits: gco (~gco@2601:647:4c80:2424:418a:abd4:7537:fe66) (Quit: ZZZzzz…)
[06:50:00] <imode> http://okturing.com/src/12884/body
[06:50:20] <imode> a while ago I was digging into a low-mental-overhead logic programming language.
[06:50:40] <imode> trying to implement one, rather.
[06:51:33] <imode> that paste is from an attempt. the model is pretty simple. instead of RAM, you have an associative memory device. you can hand a pattern to this device and it'll hand you back a completed datum.
[06:52:13] <imode> you can combine this with a destructive operation when you request data to remove the datum from the device's memory when you send the pattern over.
[06:53:25] <imode> elements of the device's memory are just simple variable-length entries. each entry was, if I recall, a 8-length array of 512-byte memory chunks.
[06:53:46] <imode> tuples, effectively. just fixed-sized.
[06:55:00] <imode> your operations are: read, read destructively, and write. control flow, as shown in the snippet above, was dicated by pattern matching.
[06:55:31] <imode> code was organized into simple rules. each rule had a left hand side, and a right hand side.
[06:55:52] <imode> the first rule in that paste, for example, has "player is in foyer? player moves north;" as its left-hand side, and "say "The door is barred from the other side."" as its right-hand side.
[06:56:23] <imode> both sides are comprised of tuples, delimited by two different kinds of delimiters.
[06:56:43] <imode> for the left hand side, if a tuple "ends" with a ?, then it's a non-destructive read. you're checking to see whether the tuple exists in-memory.
[06:57:10] <imode> if a tuple ends with a ; then it's a destructive read.
[06:57:48] <imode> if we're able to perform all of the operations on the left hand side successfully, then we write all of the tuples on the right hand side to memory. we can use variables that were bound from the left hand side on the right hand side.
[06:58:51] <imode> it's an all-or-nothing operation. if a rule doesn't meet its criteria, it does nothing.
[07:00:03] <imode> unfortunately there are some flaws to this execution approach. if you take a read through the rules, you'll notice they're ordered: most specific to least specific. this is because execution order was deterministic within a ruleset.
[07:01:26] <imode> blessing and a curse. a sane optimizer can recognize dependencies and rule ordering and deduce simple conditional control flow that would translate a ruleset like this into a giant if/else wrapped by a loop.
[07:01:34] <imode> or rather, a chain of if/elses.
[07:03:38] <imode> this system was an experiment in sparse/additive programming, whereby individual facets of a program/system can be engineered in near isolation, even without the requirement of source edits.
[07:04:48] <imode> you can add and remove rules/rulesets at whim and your overall program logic will change accordingly. it was also an exercise in distributed REPL design, where you can link multiple machines and operate as if they were sharing the same associative memory.
[07:06:32] <imode> things get complicated when you involve things like complex math expressions, or want to, say, design a "function"/"method"/"procedure" in the style of traditional imperative languages.
[07:06:37] *** Quits: bontaq (~user@ool-45779fe5.dyn.optonline.net) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[07:07:25] <imode> how does a ruleset, for example, add two numbers together, or execute a rule if something is greater than another thing.
[07:08:26] <imode> you could build it in two layers, kind of like that snippet. that had support for string interpolation relative to bound variables. the underlying operations can be expanded to include mathematical ops, and expressions can be broken out.
[07:09:32] <imode> but I'm of the opinion that if you're going to provide a built-in, you need to explore what it'd be like to go without it. that means formulating, say, the natural numbers and operations on them.
[07:10:33] <imode> and that's got my brain in a loop, along with the hypothetical of "what if we restrict tuples to pairs and swapped the elements of the pairs to guaranteed-unique identifiers".
[07:11:27] <imode> basically restricting this whole thing to undirected graph rewriting, which you can build up to directed and labeled graph rewriting, and eventually recover the arbitrary-length tuples again.
[07:12:17] <imode> I've been thinking of individual rules as "agents", for lack of a better term for them. they're single-service individuals that take input from their immediate environment and spit stuff back at their environment.
[07:13:01] <imode> so, walking back to the math expression idea, I could theoretically construct a mathematical expression as sequences of binary operations on numbers.
[07:13:11] <imode> binary or unary.
[07:15:51] <imode> but the interesting part is in the interface. if I wanted to request to compare `A` and `B`, I need to write something like `the-requester A<B? A < B` to the tuple store. `the-requester` is something I'll use to search for a result, along with `A<B?` to narrow down which calculation I'm looking for, with a simple comparison as the rest.
[07:16:42] <imode> another agent will look at that, matching against stuff like `$sender $label $first < $second`, and write back something like `the-requester A<B? true`
[07:17:32] <imode> which can then be matched by another rule. so you're really just sending something off and then waiting, but that takes up two "rules" worth of code space at minimum.
[07:18:22] <imode> anyway, the request/response stuff is interesting. I think it's a bit clunky in rule form but imperatively it does work out.
[07:18:42] <imode> I will release the lock on this channel and stop flooding it with nonsense.

[14:18:39] <gerikson> lol https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29793443
[14:18:39] <buttsbot> This is one of those things where it's almost quicker to write a new SSG than to... | Hacker News
[14:19:34] <gerikson> so true
[14:23:00] <riv> haha
[14:23:15] <riv> Is there a good SSG generator?
[14:23:27] <riv> just specify the minimum set of features you want and it makes it
[14:24:48] <gthm> every programmer is an SSG generator
[15:09:51] <gerikson> ``It's based on Next.js, so React/TypeScript, your blog posts are in Markdown and it generates an RSS feed of your posts. Could be a way to get off the ground quickly?''
[15:11:01] <riv> TypeScript +1, RSS feed +1
[15:11:13] <riv> Markdown .. if it's commonmark +1
[15:11:16] <gerikson> lawl
[15:11:19] <riv> honestly might not be too awful
[15:11:28] <riv> the only thing is next.js makes me worried
[15:11:47] <riv> i dont know what it is but anything.js is usually terrible
[15:37:53] <epilys> It's a thing that everyone eventually writes their own SSG
[16:54:09] <Brekkjern> I tried at one point, but I spent more time doing feature creep than actually making a site :P
[16:54:32] <Geekingfrog> isn't that the point ?
[16:54:40] <riv> I wonder if my wiki counts as an ssg
[16:54:43] <riv> not that I made it
[16:54:46] <riv> I just improved it
[17:02:57] <epilys> the point is to have fun in feature creep/bikeshedding etc
[17:03:38] <epilys> This was my bad attempt which uses pandoc https://nessuent.xyz/libssg.html
[17:03:39] <buttsbot> libssg
[17:05:17] <riv> rust and haskell :D
[17:05:48] <epilys> ruskell
[17:41:55] <gwozniak> I have my own SSG for my site.  That's my only private programming project that anyone really sees the output of
[17:42:12] <gwozniak> It's mostly Makefile driven
[17:45:10] <epilys> have to use zoom for the first time for a job interview, does it work ok on Android? Don't want to pollute my linux with it
[17:57:58] <Brekkjern> I don't see any reason it wouldn't work fine on Android?
[17:59:22] <epilys> thanks, I'm just a luddite at this stuff
[18:03:48] <skyl4rk> how do people deal with markdown and other syntactic-indent languages in online editors? drop textarea and go for rich editors? use plugins that brings up an emacs/neovim window? C-c/C-v four spaces and trying to hide the pain?
[18:04:28] <Brekkjern> I just use double space instead of 4 spaces if that's allowed...
[18:04:42] <Brekkjern> Often it is
[18:04:51] <epilys> Use vim without plugins, just copying to system clipboard
[18:04:51] <ngoldbaum> just type four spaces?
[18:05:13] <ngoldbaum> if you really need to write a ton of text on reddit or whatever, copy/paste from emacs
[18:05:20] <gwozniak> I just type the four spaces
[18:05:28] <companion_cube> I try to avoid web editors
[18:06:14] <gwozniak> I used to try to everything in Emacs and found out it's more trouble than it's worth
[18:08:47] <skyl4rk> if i'm going to just copy and paste the entire thing from my favourite editor I might just as well build the workflow around that, with some rsync+script ...which might be the best solution for initial bulk text I guess
[18:09:35] <epilys> isn't copy paste a workflow?
[18:12:58] <skyl4rk> I didn't say it isn't. Although I am prejudiced against it, but for reasons perhaps not applicable here (imagine across citrix, across linux-windows, across some_terminal-some_ms_office_rich_text_whatever)
[18:13:47] <ngoldbaum> they’re livestreaming the tensioning of the fifth sunshield layer on jwst rn on nasa tv
[18:13:48] <epilys> well your initial question was too general then
[18:13:52] <Brekkjern> I absolutely love working through 3 different remote desktop solutions stacked on top of each other. Makes for a smooth experience.
[18:14:08] <Brekkjern> I love how you can't ever know if the keyboard layout will work properly...
[18:14:26] <ngoldbaum> iirc there were at one point firefox plugins that let you type into web text boxes from emacs or vim
[18:14:38] <ngoldbaum> dunno if mozilla broke that at one point
[18:15:13] <skyl4rk> ngoldbaum: I found one that opens up a neovim window and places it on top of the textarea.
[18:15:49] <Brekkjern> https://i.redd.it/ni194057un981.jpg
[18:15:50] <Brekkjern> I think I lost IQ reading this?
[18:16:07] <skyl4rk> seems to follow browser window resizes as well
[18:17:00] <epilys> sites should just ship their own neovim with wasm /s
[18:17:19] <Brekkjern> That would be hilarious
[18:18:26] <epilys> they can even load your config with that future javascript FS access api
[18:19:06] <Brekkjern> https://i.redd.it/zpu00uaphn981.jpg
[18:19:07] <Brekkjern> Wow
[18:20:05] <skyl4rk> epilys: (too general question) why? I mean, I might not /like/ the suggestion but I might still conclude it's a better answer than the others for example, or not - but that would still not invalidate it as a solution with some benefits and drawbacks.
[18:22:22] <skyl4rk> oh, the 'imagine' thing was not about my current use-case, but to explain my prejudice, if that wasn't clear

[21:48:44] <dminkovsky> " I've been slugging it out in the code mines for 35 years" that would explain his nick
[21:48:48] <dminkovsky> FeOH
[21:48:55] <dminkovsky> i'm guessing
[21:49:31] <imode> "I am willing to substitute my reality with one that is convenient for my employers."
[21:49:48] <dminkovsky> i tried to read but failed
[21:50:27] <ngoldbaum> indigo: the email is formatted incorrectly, has typos and bad grammar, but comes from the amazon.com domain
[21:50:27] <imode> 35 years and you choose to go to Amazon.
[21:50:35] * ngoldbaum honestly isn’t sure if he’s being phished

[21:51:44] <gwozniak> I get Facebook stuff and I just classify it as spam
[21:52:04] <gwozniak> I used to reply to the Google recruiters, but stopped that too and, eventually, they stopped
[22:09:22] <indigo> I had a fun string of emails from Shef
[22:09:38] <indigo> First one from the CEO, then one from Head of Recruiting, then one from the actual recruiter
[22:16:05] <imode> hm. odd sensation.
[22:16:11] <imode> sternum pain radiating through to the left side of my neck.
[22:16:21] <imode> very faint.
[22:17:42] <imode> probably just heartburn or something.
[22:17:55] <imode> though the sternum pain is intense.
[22:19:54] <ngoldbaum> if it doesn’t stop it might be a heart attack
[22:20:51] <imode> have had it for a couple days, have had it previously as well.
[22:21:09] <manicennui> Did you sleep on that side?
[22:21:27] <imode> it's directly in the center of my chest. like, along the sternum.

[23:03:01] <riv> ah
[23:03:32] <imode> all in private conversation but uh, they're incredibly quick to dismiss any kind of discussion with "you're angry".
[23:03:53] <ngoldbaum> tbf you are kinda angry
[23:04:25] <imode> saying someone's angry immediately sets a tone. you then implicitly view every statement as if it's fueled with rage.
[23:04:36] <imode> it's a great way to derail and devalue someone in a discussion.
[23:05:30] <imode> it's like if you called me insane and that set a bit in someone's head to assume everything I say from that point forward is total nonsense, and that I'm not acting in sound mind or body.
