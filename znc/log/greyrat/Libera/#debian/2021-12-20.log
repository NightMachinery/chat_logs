[00:10:09] <b4d> Hi, quick one, how could I convert "ip addr add 10.10.10.1 dev lo" command to static entry in /etc/network/interfaces? Thanks!
[00:10:33] <somiaj> you could ad a post-up line to the lo stanza
[00:11:16] <b4d> so just "address 10.10.10.1" under lo?

[00:11:36] <xx> no
[00:11:58] <somiaj> no, you are adding an additional address, you'll want to ad this as a post-up command to run after the interface is up
[00:15:10] <Khepra> can they not simply define both 127.0.0.1 and whatever other, explictely?
[00:16:11] <rawtaz> im sorry if this is too off topic but is or has anyone here using/used DebOps and would comment on whether they think it's "worth it"? i mean, sure, it's ansible, but since theyre so "complete" the tasks etc are pretty complex, and if you do use it you will inevitable end up with a mix of debops and your own ansible roles, and probably also hit cases where they arent fully supporting your use case, etc.
[00:16:41] <rawtaz> so basically, is it worth introducing this "dependency" instead of just going with ansible on your own (especially considering you dont gain much in platform independence)?
[00:16:51] <rawtaz> just looking for general opinions and experiences if any :)
[00:17:48] <somiaj> Khepra: I don't think so. EVery time I've seen this, it was via post-up lines.
[00:18:41] <somiaj> though that is what post-up is for, adding additional comands to configure things that don't have a standard setup

[05:15:39] <mannequin> i got few packages from sid pinned
[05:15:56] <mannequin> firmware, kernel and gimp
[05:16:13] *** Joins: paulgrmn__ (~paulgrmn@user/paulgrmn)
[05:18:04] <somiaj> are you mixing sid and stable?
[05:19:03] <somiaj> anyways, we can't support that and you are only asking for pain, espically with gimp pulling in so many core libs from sid
[05:19:35] <somiaj> we also strongly suggest you don't mix sid and stable
[05:20:33] <mannequin> so how do i rollback to full stable?
[05:20:58] <somiaj> In general you can't, at this point you are kinda in a broken state. First backup user data
[05:21:01] <somiaj> !partial downgrade
[05:21:01] <dpkg> This may or may not work for you, but if you've got nothing to lose then try it: (a) change sources.list (b) aptitude update (c) aptitude and then search for the upgraded packages, hit enter on them, select the correct version (d) do the same for libc6 (e) search for broken packages by pressing "b" and then fix them in the same way (f) once you have no more broken packages, hit 'g'.  See <not available>.
[05:21:16] <somiaj> something like that may work, but with gimp, its depends are very big, you could have quite a mess on your hands
[05:25:35] <mannequin> actually
[05:25:45] <mannequin> it didn't install because i had to specify -esr
[05:25:57] <mannequin> i understand now, nothing was broken
[05:26:07] <mannequin> the non -esr version resides in sid
[05:27:49] <somiaj> still if you are mixing sid and stable unknown things may break in the future and #debian cannot support that
[05:28:05] <mannequin> i just do that for firmware, kernel and gimp
[05:28:38] <somiaj> gimps depends are huge and contain many core libs, and the firmare and kernel can be found in backports
[05:28:41] <somiaj> ,v gimp
[05:28:42] <judd> Package: gimp on amd64 -- stretch: 2.8.18-1+deb9u1; stretch-security: 2.8.18-1+deb9u1; buster: 2.10.8-2; bullseye: 2.10.22-4; bookworm: 2.10.28-1; sid: 2.10.28-1

[06:55:07] <somiaj> mannequin: What firmware? Is there not a new enough version in backports (note most of the time you don't need the newest firmware, just new enough to support the hardware you have)
[06:55:30] <mannequin> amdgpu, linux free and linux-nonfree
[06:55:59] <somiaj> ,v linux-nonfree
[06:56:00] <judd> No package named 'linux-nonfree' was found in amd64.

[06:56:42] <somiaj> Though most likely you don't need the newer firmware, unless you have a bleeding edge gpu
[06:57:02] <mannequin> well, this machine is ryzen 2500u
[06:57:27] <mannequin> and i'm planning on building kernel on my own
[06:57:37] <mannequin> because it has issues with the rtl driver
[06:58:20] <somiaj> 2500u was released in 2017, so I would suspect the bullseye firmware to be sufficent.

[06:58:54] <mannequin> you might mbe right
[06:58:58] <mannequin> be*
[06:58:59] <somiaj> Anyawys, installing newer firmware from sid is fine, in general you don't need to, it sometimes gets backported. But that is besides the point, it is just general practice to state say don't mix stable/sid
[06:59:35] <somiaj> so I would just suggest avoiding pinning/installing anytinng from sid. If you need a newer kernel use backports. If you need newer firmware, sometimes it is worth downloading it from kernel.org

[14:32:48] <Khepra> ofm: as a side note, "partition flags" or filesystems types have NOTHING to do with appearance of /dev/ nodes. those are hardware, block device nodes, completely agnostic to what's ON the block device.

[16:39:39] <dpkg> To have dhclient etc not touch /etc/resolv.conf, the best plan is to configure it not to touch that file. See https://wiki.debian.org/resolv.conf for more details. Note that by ignoring the DHCP-provided DNS servers, you may find that you are unable to use captive portals or surf the web on some network. Beware creating technical debt by doing things like chattr +i
[16:40:04] <tete_> ok thanks, i'll take a look at that
[16:43:20] <taman> jelly: are you sure resolvconf is needed? I don't have it installed, just a 'nodnsupdate' file for dhcp.

[16:45:41] <Khepra> tete_: btw, DNSBLs have typically low TTL, so unless you're somehow overriding that at your caching recursive resolver, you're still having the same problem unless you have large number of connection from same IPs. also take a look at postscreen, in that case

[16:54:52] <Haohmaru> how did you uninstall it?

[16:59:08] <Khepra> the metapackage I mean
[16:59:29] <Khepra> debian is debootstrap'able just fine with no kernel in sight. nothing requires it except of course DKMS things that then want teh headers
[16:59:53] <Haohmaru> so if i decide to remove Noto fonts, a ton of sh*t has to be removed too, yet it's okay to accidentally remove all your kernels?
[17:00:04] <Khepra> I don't see how that would happen

[18:00:19] <Khepra> FreeBSD is superior in so many ways except one: it's almost hobbyst, given the tiny community

[18:02:26] <xx> what's the most racist/bigoted/whatever distro out there?
[18:02:33] <Khepra> agreed tho. the internals stink to high heaven and back, but it's the best we have so far, in terms of user facing knobs, APIs, capabilities
[18:03:22] <Khepra> people say it's for desktops, not servers, but I find that quite the opposite. I don't see the ini on desktop. I see and use a lot of systemd APIs on servers and I'm so glad they're there.
[18:03:54] <jkc> Khepra++
[18:03:55] <Khepra> in fact, ain't even a matter of option. no other init/process manager has some critical capabilities that systemd .service unit have. so there's actually even no alternative for those things
[18:04:36] <jelly> there are different tools that have subset of capabilities.
[18:05:27] <Khepra> jelly: actually not for all of them. at the moment, there is no alternative unless you write your own, that allows you configure seccomp, namespacing, cgroup resourcing and apparmor profile, for a service
[18:06:18] <Khepra> you'd have to script custom namespacing based on unshare and manual bind mounts, you'd have to write a c program to do seccomp filtering of forked' children (I don't know of any in existence) and you'd have manage custom apparmor profiling via shim scripts, cgroups via sysfs and tempfiles, I suppose
[18:07:20] <Khepra> and before someone says containers:     NO.   containers require you to precreate a whole root tree for all the libs you might need. systemd permits and does namespacing based on existing packages and paths on already existing rootfs. way superior.

[21:10:29] *** Joins: ccallahan (~quassel@redhat/ccallahan)
[21:10:49] <Khepra> however, that's just temporary solution. using sid, even in combo with testing, will sooner or later create dependency issues if you don't allow it to progress naturally.
[21:11:01] <beastwick> In Arch you have to upgrade the entire system before installing newer or new software to ensure shared libraries don't get borked. That's why you can't just sync repos and grab something new, everything basically has to go up. In debian, it seems like that is not the case and my assumption is apt is really good at telling you what dependencies all
[21:11:02] <beastwick> around have to be upgraded together.

[21:14:26] <Khepra> it's not apt per se. apt doesn't really give you an option. it's the way packages are upgraded in debian repos. as testing cuts off into next stable, for a short while stable <=> testing and <=> sid have same versions of packages. as packages in sid upgrade, that trickles down to testing, and very rarely to stable.
[21:15:12] <Khepra> beastwick: now, if you have package A1 from sid, and it depends on B1. A1 might be in stable too, until sid bumps it to A2. However, A1 mightr still depend on B1. at some point, it depends on B2, so if you ahve B1 from testing, it will upgrade to B2 from sid.
[21:15:34] <Khepra> so it's not like you can mix and match. dependencies and versions are clearly stated by packages.
[21:16:35] <beastwick> right that's what I mean, I can depend on apt to upgrade all dependencies and not worry about a package suddenly not working because a library it dependended on was upgraded by something from sid. Apt would of made sure to upgrade both packages due to shared dependencies or refuse because it is not solvable.
[21:16:40] <Khepra> (and I Typo'd, I meant as A1 bumps to A2, A2 might still depend on B1, until it starts depending on B2)
[21:16:56] <beastwick> wow depended* not sure what I wrote there

[21:18:19] <Khepra> first, a A2 might bump but B1 can't work with A2. this mostly affects kernels and DKMS
[21:19:04] <Khepra> for example it may happen that the kernel in sid/testing bumps but zfs lags and boom, you can no longer build zfs until that is upgraded as well

[21:19:29] <Khepra> it's important to be aware of this and apt-mark hold until dependencies are satisfied (zfs bumped to version that supports the kernel in sid)
[21:19:37] <jelly> beastwick, apt just tracks deps, it's the packages that needs to keep track of what they depend on and what the break.
[21:19:45] <jelly> what they break
[21:19:45] <Khepra> but then that might make your system vulnerable because you can't bump for a secvuln patch
[21:20:49] <Khepra> and the otehr thing is API/logical dependency. pacakge A requires certain functionality from B, and doesn't depend on it or its version directly. B bumps, loses the functionality and A no longer works.
[21:21:00] <Khepra> python and perl things fall in this category, for example

[23:38:32] <somiaj> 5.15 hasn't even hit sid yet, though it was only recentally released
[23:39:18] <rendar> with debian testing i get this, bookworm: 5.14.0-1-686
[23:39:19] <rendar> right?
[23:40:10] <Khepra> I run stable but I build kernel.org kernels and firmware because my amdgpu is too new. March 2021.
[23:40:15] <somiaj> yea, though once the kernel makes it to testing it will also make it to backports, so the newer kernel will be availbe for both
[23:40:45] <rendar> Khepra, i see
[23:40:56] <somiaj> so I do think one could get that chip to work in debian bullseye, but one would require a bit more knowledge about things than a standard user to do so. In general it is often suggested not to buy bleeding edge hardware if you want things to work out of the box in debian stable
[23:40:58] <rendar> Khepra, can i ask you which amdgpu do you have?
[23:41:12] <somiaj> rendar: though is uspect a backport kernel + upstream firmware would work too, no need to build your own kernel here
[23:41:28] <rendar> yes, i agree
[23:41:33] <somiaj> unless of course you have to have 5.15 and cna't wait
[23:41:43] <rendar> but i want just to know what Khepra is doing
[23:42:12] <Khepra> rendar: RX 6700 XT
[23:42:17] <jmcnaught> Ryzen 7 5700G APU uses a Vega GPU core, which is not the most recent from AMD so a backports kernel may not even be required.
[23:42:23] <rendar> if i'm on Debian stable, backports will install testing stuff, and if i'm on testing, backports will install sid stuff?
[23:42:38] <somiaj> rendar: no
[23:42:45] <rendar> jmcnaught, oh! that's interesting new, thanks
[23:42:56] <somiaj> rendar: backports are packages from testing built for stable (so they aren't testing packages, they are backports)

[23:48:05] <rendar> i was scared that installing Debian wouldn't have work with 5700G, but i think it should be absolutely fine
[23:48:07] *** Joins: Kays (Kays@user/kays)
[23:49:18] <jmcnaught> You could always test with a live Debian first before installing.

[23:50:57] <rendar> if it doesn't work well with Debian i would wait to spend money
[23:51:21] <jmcnaught> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radeon_RX_Vega_series released in 2017 and lists 5700G as one of the APUs it's in.
[23:51:40] <somiaj> to me if it doesn't work out of the box, you can get it to work via backports. How difficutl this is depends on your experience
[23:51:51] *** Joins: Tokamak_ (~Tokamak@172.58.191.77)
[23:52:18] <somiaj> but unless you get lucky and someone here has used that exact apu, you just have to kinda wing it
[23:52:24] <somiaj> or search google and see if you can get an testomials that way
[23:54:56] <blluis> Hi, I need some help to install previous firefox version, today, apt updated my FF to 91.4.1esr and I found some bugs in debug console that left this version unusable for me, looking at debian page, seems that previous version was 78.15.0esr-1~deb11u1, is there any way to install this version from apt without loosing FF settings?
[23:55:41] <blluis> I know that I can purge firefox and manually download the deb package, but Im looking for some apt way
[23:56:39] <at0m> blluis: firefox doesnt support opening newer profiles with older versions, i'm afraid. you could try.. in aptitude, remove ff and select an older version if it's listed there
[23:56:44] *** Quits: mooff (mooff@awful.cooking) (Quit: Quit)
[23:57:32] <at0m> blluis: i've copied profiles back and forth, even between free and non-free OS's, so you might be lucky. or not. one way to find out i guess.
[23:58:26] <at0m> blluis: also, if the newer version "doesn't load", you could try running "firefox -safe-mode"
[23:59:07] <blluis> I use to backup bookmarks and use to work, settings can me manually set, how do I use apt with version, this is the one I want to install https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/firefox-esr
[23:59:24] <at0m> or -ProfileManager, make a new profile and see if it's something in the old profile that causes the err
[23:59:37] <Khepra> blluis: there's no going back to 78 unless you build it from source or fish out the old debs from archive . you do know taht version has more security holes than most expensive breed of swiss cheese?
