[00:15:30] <Anthaas> Is there a sensible way in a pre-commit hook to get the project root?
[00:16:01] <ikke> try git rev-parse --show-toplevel
[00:16:19] <ikke> there might also be an env variable that has it

[00:20:08] <rafasc> I believe the pre-commit hooks starts at the top-level already.
[00:21:44] <Anthaas> It was because I wanted to perform a search within the hook using the find command.

[00:25:40] <Anthaas> That said, I need to run a grep over the results - I'm only interested in certain files.
[00:26:15] <rafasc> depending on what you're searching for, diff also has --filter that detects some conditions.

[00:32:42] <Anthaas> I don't think that helps my issue?
[00:33:01] <Anthaas> This is in a pre-commit hook, I want a list of paths to files called vault.yml that are about to be committed.
[00:35:16] <rafasc> the -z is a differnt issue. It's there to deal with problems when your filenames contain spaces.
[00:35:24] <rafasc> or worse, newlines.
[00:35:38] <rafasc> you can use something like: git diff --cached --name-only -- :/vault.yml :/**/vault.yml
[00:35:51] <Anthaas> Oh, sure, but I am running it through `read -r -d $'\0'` so the termination is what I was after.
[00:37:01] <Anthaas> rafasc That command only lists the vault.yml files, but its on one line and separated by ^@ in my terminal.
[00:37:16] <Anthaas> Or rather, ^@ trails the paths.
[00:37:32] <rafasc> and you can add --filter=d to not trigger the hook on deletions for example.

[00:44:04] <rafasc> Anthaas: I just did a 6line paste. You would be fine :)
[00:44:47] <tirnanog> if you're going to use grep that way, you need the non-portable -z option. otherwise, try to have git do the filtering as was discussed, or do the filtering in bash.

[00:45:21] <tirnanog> yes?
[00:45:33] <Anthaas> rafasc If I do that, I get ^@ after the path, and all the paths on one line.

[00:45:44] <ikke> ^@ is a nul-byte

[00:46:17] <tirnanog> I'd just go with what rafasc said. otherwise, it would be grep -z or [[ $REPLY == *vault.yml* ]] && ...
[00:46:20] <Anthaas> Ahhh, so it'll still populate my array as expected.
[00:46:20] <rafasc> if you're getting that, you are not parsing it correctly.
[00:46:35] <Anthaas> I was just running the command in the terminal to see what it would give me.
[00:46:51] <tirnanog> Anthaas: yes. but if git can already do what you want, it makes sense to leverage it.
[00:47:02] <Anthaas> Yeah - I'll add the magic now.

[00:49:10] <Anthaas> Amazing - this works perfectly now! Thanks!
[00:49:11] <tirnanog> as an aside, in case don't need to support anything older than bash 4.4, it can be: mapfile -td '' vault_files < <(git ...)
[00:50:20] <rafasc> the ^@ is character that is not allowed to be in pathnames. If you know your files will not have spaces/new lines as part of the path, you can get away with simple greps. If you want to be safe against all cases, you go with -z, but that means your parsing needs to be adapted on the reading side. ( read -d ''; grep -z, xargs -0, etc...)
[00:50:37] <rafasc> and as tirnanog, many of those options are not portable.

[00:53:21] <Anthaas> Would make more sense...

[00:54:39] <rafasc> if you're not doing stuff with the file themselves, i.e just exiting, you can use --quiet or --exit-code
[00:55:07] <rafasc> nvm, you're doing aditional checks.
[00:55:10] <Anthaas> I'm grepping them to check for content.
[00:56:14] <rafasc> seems alright.
[00:57:08] <Anthaas> Thanks!
[00:57:19] <rafasc> if ! (grep -q "\$ANSIBLE_VAULT;" < "$file"); can be: if ! grep -q "\$ANSIBLE_VAULT;" "$file";
[00:57:29] <tirnanog> was about to say the same thing. needless subshell.
[00:57:32] <rafasc> grep accepts files as arguments, no need for that redirection
[00:58:37] <Anthaas> Nice change, thanks!
[00:58:38] <tirnanog> anyway, looks ok.
[00:58:51] <rafasc> and I tend to use printf over echo. But yeah, overall looks alright.
[00:59:46] <Anthaas> echo I think is easier to read with the colour escapes.
[01:00:19] <tirnanog> localizing vault_files might be sensible.
[01:00:27] <tirnanog> I mean, it's bash so why not.
[01:01:10] <Anthaas> Localizing them? They are paths - should they not just be given back as they are found?
[01:02:39] <tirnanog> I mean, declare -a vault_files - or local -a vault_files, if you prefer. there doesn't appear to be any intention to use the array outside the scope of the function.
[01:03:50] <Anthaas> Ahhh thats a fair point.

[04:54:37] <bremner> you can, but you probably shouldn't
[04:54:40] <nedbat> celphi: yes, but then you will be rewriting history
[04:54:55] <bremner> !rewrite
[04:54:55] <gitinfo> Rewriting public history is not recommended. Everyone who has pulled the old history will have to do work (and you'll have to tell them to), so it's infinitely better to just move on. If you must, you can use `git push --force-with-lease <remote> <branch>` to force (and the remote may reject that, anyway). See http://goo.gl/waqum

[04:56:24] <circuitbone> You can `git commit --amend` the name with extra info so you can see this one is a mistake commit or something special.

[11:09:45] <lpapp> Thanks, but I thought merges will merge the commit history?
[11:10:02] <osse> correct
[11:10:24] <lpapp> then the 50 commits should contain all the changes, one of which is the offending?
[11:10:51] <osse> correct
[11:11:03] <lpapp> so why 251 revisions and 7 steps?

[11:12:02] <osse> you can get that if you use git bisect --first-parent

[11:12:27] <lpapp> what is the reason for this not being the default?
[11:12:53] <osse> the problem with that is that merge commits are often huge (in terms of the diff) so if the offending commit is a merge, you are potentially wanting to be more precise

[11:13:19] <lpapp> but if the commits are also in the branch, why would bisect not ignore merge commits?
[11:14:00] <lpapp> is it to configure whether one wants to point at a bad merge commit or an individual one from the merge?

[11:15:10] <lpapp> when you merge from a source branch to a destination branch, e.g. main
[11:15:20] <TJ-> osse: thanks, yes, that could help
[11:15:21] <lpapp> you get the individual commits from the source branch into main, and one extra merge commit.
[11:15:26] <lpapp> right?
[11:15:33] <osse> yes
[11:15:42] <lpapp> so, why does git bisect not skip the dummy merge commit when trying to find an issue?
[11:16:01] <lpapp> is it to give the decision to the git user whether to find the bad commit in a big merge or an individual commit of that big merge?
[11:17:06] <lpapp> in other words, why cannot git bisect pretend that there is no dummy merge commit?
[11:17:21] <osse> it can, using --first-parent
[11:17:33] <lpapp> why is it a configuration
[11:17:34] <lpapp> not default
[11:17:54] <lpapp> anyway, I am still confused either way
[11:18:20] <lpapp> in either case, whether the git user wants to point at a merge commit or a specific one from the merge, 251 revisions still do not make sense to me with 50 last commits in the history?
[11:18:33] <osse> presumably because the authors thought that most people would want to know exactly which commit caused the problem, regardless of whether it was brought into history via a merge or not
[11:19:01] <lpapp> yeah, but why cannot git bisect do that intention in both cases by default?
[11:19:09] <lpapp> It would just mean to skip merge commits when bisecting?
[11:21:10] <osse> I don't know whether git bisect checks the merge commits themselves. maybe it does

[12:36:38] <hendry> when i do a `git diff main` it gives me files that i actually haven't changed. I think this was my confusion.
[12:36:55] <hendry> how do i do git diff and only show the files that i modified?

[12:37:02] <ikke> including the dots

I wanted to manipulate git log so that it shows me commits from some time ranges, therefore I quickly found out that --after/since/until/before are the answer. However, I can get some commits listed out of this range. It seems to be related to some difference between author and commiter time from what I read somewhere. Is there some way to have a consistent display for
[17:35:04] <Porkepix> that? Bonus question, is there a syntax for a single day? `--after 2021-06-14 --until 2021-06-15` matches both 14 and 15 while `--after 2021-06-15 --until 2021-06-15` matches nothing

[17:37:33] <sandman13> I am wondering if apart from the workflow above, for something like Github/Gitlab or projects where PR based workflow occurs, is it right to use 'git rebase' for merging and push it

[18:44:19] <Porkepix> So, would that translation/approximation of the date search be correct? And no way to search by commiter's date?
[18:44:54] <osse> Porkepix: as ikke said, yes it's correct
[18:45:21] <osse> a bit of confusion here, perhaps. it *is* the committer date that is used, but it sounds like you want the author date
[18:47:55] <Porkepix> osse: Oh yeah, I might have switch. I meant search is using commiter's date but it displays author's date by default
[18:48:12] <osse> I can't find a way to make it use the author date

[18:55:34] <Porkepix> When I use --autosquash I just :wq in vim immeditely

[20:01:19] <wyre> I'm trying to cherry-pick the 080a9f0 into testing-052 https://bpa.st/SSVA if I do this this cherry-picking will add non existent files?
[20:01:37] <wyre> I just want modifications for a particular file
[20:01:55] <wyre> (I mean, non existent files in testing-052)
[20:02:11] <osse> wyre: if that commit modifies files that are not present in the branch then it will conflict
[20:02:52] <wyre> osse, if modified files aren't in the branch it shouldn't just create them?
[20:03:10] <wyre> I mean, the conflict is not apparently when the commit modifies existent files in the branch?
[20:04:45] <thiago> it will add without conflict only if that commit you're cherry-picking added that file
[20:04:45] <thiago> if it's a modification of a non-existent file, it's a conflict
[20:04:49] <wyre> 080a9f0 just modifies a file regarding 361f105
[20:05:16] <wyre> and the file also exist in a601674
[20:05:39] <wyre> my question is ... all files that doesn't exist in a601674 but exist in 080a9f0 will be also added?
[20:06:11] <osse> wyre: depends
[20:06:13] <thiago> cherry-pick applies the delta, so anything that didn't change in that commit is untouched
[20:06:26] <wyre> thiago, oh, I see
[20:09:00] <thiago> cherry-pick is exactly the same as git format-patch followed by git am

[20:14:32] <thiago> if you don't have a conflict, be glad
[20:15:00] <wyre> thiago, the point is that I should have the conflict because are things that should change
[20:15:38] <wyre> or well, at least these things should be modified without conflicts because they are in the diff output 🤔
[20:15:53] <thiago> they didn't conflict because git am applied successfully

[20:16:50] <wyre> if line 42 is not removed ... it's not applying the commit

[20:19:19] <thiago> I usually don't spend time trying to learn why something worked; usually I reserve time to understand why things didn't work
[20:19:43] <wyre> thiago, you are missing the point, it's not working if changes I need aren't being applied

[20:22:45] <thiago> look at the output of git show on that commit to see what will be applied

[22:15:00] <fdan> when i try to do a git push, it says  the current branch has no upstream branch

[22:52:48] <thiago> or commit the new state once you have what you want, after checking the files out

[22:54:38] <mra90> ok lets try that
[22:55:11] <thiago> resets can always be undone by more resets, from the reflog, except uncommitted changes

[23:10:16] <atrigent> can anyone explain the descriptions of the --merge and --keep options that are in the git reset man page? in particular, what about those two descriptions explains how they behave differently?
[23:11:53] * thiago had never seen those options
[23:13:57] <thiago> looks like --keep is the same as --hard, but aborts if the files it would change have uncommitted changes
[23:14:44] <thiago> all otherso it doesn't touch files with uncommitted changes at all
[23:15:43] <thiago> I'm trying to understand the difference between --merge and --keep now
[23:16:07] <atrigent> is there a difference between "resets the index" and "resets index entries"?
[23:16:21] <thiago> I don't think so
[23:16:33] <thiago> resetting the index implies resetting the entries in that index, right?
[23:16:47] <atrigent> I would think so, yes
[23:17:00] <atrigent> but it's a conspicuous difference in wording
[23:17:32] <thiago> so --merge updates the index if the index and the current commit are the same, but will not touch unmodified files themselves

[23:22:55] <atrigent> I don't think --keep is comparable to --hard, since the latter will reset all files, regardless of whether they changed between the two commits

[23:23:44] <thiago> but the effect is the same for unmodified files
[23:23:48] <thiago> --keep will not touch them
[23:24:00] <thiago> so it's the same if you add that exception

[23:32:48] <AbleBacon> how do i undo committing a submodule change without having to actually check out the previous submodule?
[23:34:22] <AbleBacon> i'll explain...
[23:34:22] <thiago> in the supermodule, you can probably "git checkout @~ submodulepath"
[23:34:23] <AbleBacon> oh! well lemme give that a try! :D

[23:43:19] <AbleBacon> it didn't work. what happened was i have a project that uses gstreamer as a submodule, and i started out checking gstreamer out from their github. but the process of building it changed my submodule repo and now it has a different hash (or whatever). i accidentally did "git add --all" so this version of gstreamer that doesn't exist anywhere got sent up to gerrit, and now when people check it out, it tries to grab this gstreamer version that is nowhere
[23:43:19] <AbleBacon> to be found and fails
