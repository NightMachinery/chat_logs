[02:27:41] <jaafarrc> I already have a few recommendations from a friend who's a Neovim enthusiast.
[02:27:55] <jaafarrc> s/have/got/
[02:28:05] <jaafarrc> s/have/recieved/
[02:31:16] <gpanders> Don’t let me stop you if you’re excited about it, but there’s nothing wrong with keeping init.vim :)
[02:31:52] <jaafarrc> Yeah, you're right. Maybe I shouldn't worry about that for now.
[02:33:08] <jaafarrc> It's just that Neovim might become very distinct and incompatible from Vim one day.
[02:33:17] <jaafarrc> s/might/may/
[02:34:10] <gpanders> Lua’s biggest advantage over Vimscript is its performance and flexibility, which is very important for complex things like plugins. But for just setting a few options in your startup file, Lua doesn’t offer much benefit (and in fact is more verbose than Vimscript which is a DSL)
[02:34:15] <jaafarrc> I'm not actually familiar with Lua at all, anyway.
[02:34:52] <gpanders> The exception to that is that if you are using Lua plugins that need to be configured in Lua, and you want to do all of your configuration in a single file. Then init.lua makes much more sense
[02:34:55] <jaafarrc> And judging by some code blocks I've seen it, it does indeed look quite verbose and... not good-looking.

[02:45:15] <mhinz[m]> Jaafar: My config is basically 2 files. `init.vim`, which works for nvim _and_ vim, and `~/.config/nvim/lua/config.lua` for configuring Lua plugins, which is sourced from init.vim via:...

[02:46:04] <clason[m]> you can even just plonk it in `plugin/`, where it'll be sourced by Neovim but not VIm

[15:39:17] <baltazar> for reference, what's actually being run in these scenarios is something like `nvim -d /dev/fd/63 /dev/fd/62`
