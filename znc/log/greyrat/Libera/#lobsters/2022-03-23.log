[12:44:59] <iDrougge> kline: That may be useless to you, but if you are working in C#, you can either try to replace the language or replace the entire world.
[12:46:20] <wink> .net is something that I want to accept as being feasible for anything besides writing native windows apps
[12:46:58] <wink> but I think I've been thoroughly disappointed by microsoft for over 20 years so I don't see it happening in any form, except if I pick it up as part of some game engine
[12:47:25] <wink> I still have bad memories of ASP.NET. that name is tainted forever
[12:47:46] <bkhl> If I stick with my current job I'll be involved in converting ca 600 kLOC of Perl into C# in the next few years.
[12:47:52] <bkhl> That will be to .Net core on Linux still.
[12:48:08] <bkhl> So I'll guess I'll be developing some kind of opinion on it relatively soon …
[12:49:04] <wink> I feel I am fair enough by accepting that some people like it, that it's a valid choice for certain things.. and personally just staying the hell away :P
[12:50:43] <bkhl> I'm thinking of trying to convince us to go with F# instead, as the main point is to get on the same platform as most of the rest of the company.
[12:50:54] <bkhl> And I don't think using F# rather than C# will hurt interoperability much.
[12:50:56] <bkhl> But we'll see.
[12:53:54] <wink> no idea about that. would be interesting to draw the comparison to Clojure vs Java and Swift vs Obj-C
[12:54:29] <wink> as I only use the former, afaik the direction "using java libs from clojure" is zero problem at all (only sometimes a little clunky) but the other way round is not as perfectly easy
[12:54:43] <wink> because while clojure compiles to classes, it doesn't map to the OOP model
[12:55:04] <wink> so maybe F# has the same problem and to provide a "nice" API you maybe need to write a wrapper
[12:55:09] <iDrougge> bkhl: Perl to C#? In a few years? Your workplace seems really cutting edge.
[12:55:27] <wink> well C# does seem like a solid long-term choice
[12:55:41] <wink> if they are using .net anyway...
[12:56:01] <bkhl> iDrougge, what do you mean?
[12:56:06] <wink> you can say a lot of bad things about it but not that it's not developed anymore
[12:56:34] <iDrougge> bkhl: Porting from a mid-90s stack to an early-00s stack is what I mean.
[12:56:34] <bkhl> Yes, it's basically just my team's product using Linux and Perl, the rest of the company is mostly on Windows.
[12:57:02] <bkhl> iDrougge, what's better one that's started even more recently ..?
[12:57:30] <wink> it's years younger than Java ;)
[12:57:57] <iDrougge> bkhl: I don't want to get into language advocacy, and you would probably end up using Go or Node instead anyway, so go ahead.
[12:58:24] <iDrougge> wink: That's really difficult to tell.
[12:58:36] <bkhl> Yes, the team (before I joined) basically was offered to use .Net or Go, and went with .Net.
[12:59:16] <bkhl> If they would have chosen Go I'd probably made different career choices.
[12:59:34] <iDrougge> Perhaps I will come back scarred from F# tomorrow telling you to avoid it like the plague, but at least it is not C#.

[18:37:49] <rwb> i feel like i'm doing something wrong. isn't docker supposed to automatically clean its cache once it consumes like, over half of the available disk space
[18:39:34] <wink> that is a mystery in itself
[18:39:43] <wink> I don't know, I'm pruning it once in a while
[18:40:33] <rwb> doesn't this kind of destroy the purpose of "fire and forget" deployments
[18:40:49] <rwb> since half my nodes are now exploding because they have 100 older images in the cache
[18:41:04] <wink> that sounds wrong though
[18:41:23] <rwb> and the only notification i get about this is that the replication count isn't hitting the amount i specified
[18:41:35] <q3k> yeah, docker image lifecycle management is something you have to roll on your own
[18:41:42] <q3k> or use a higher-level system that does this for you
[18:41:55] <rwb> amazin
[18:42:04] <q3k> k8s' kubelet does that, for example
[18:42:15] <q3k> (well, back when it had a docker backend, now it does that for containerd)
[18:42:34] <wink> maybe we're talking different things by using 'docker cache' though
[18:42:57] <wink> because I built a ton of crap the last 2 days and my /var/lib/docker is 1.8gb - about as much as my current 5 images I have
[18:43:03] <wink> so everything I cleaned up is gone.
[18:43:15] <wink> and that's more like the image registry, not a cache
[18:43:23] <q3k> i think we're talking about the same thing
[18:43:25] <wink> 'registry'. local. wrong term
[18:43:32] <q3k> docker only stores two kinds of data: volumes and image layers
[18:43:57] <q3k> volumes generally don't get created automatically, and don't have runaway disk usage unless you wrote some kind of runaway script
[18:44:03] *** Joins: remerle_ (~remerle@2601:85:8203:2690:e9f0:6105:de70:5d44)
[18:44:10] <wink> yeah. but calling "docker images | grep for everything not in use or older than X| xargs docker rmi" some lifecycle management is a bit overblown imho
[18:44:23] <q3k> image layers on the other hand do tend to accumulate just with normal use, either because you run different images, or because you build a lot of other things
[18:44:26] <wink> that's what I've seen many people do, before k8s was around
[18:44:35] <q3k> wink: right, but you still have to remember to do that
[18:44:43] <wink> yeah of course.
[18:44:54] <q3k> plus the 'not in use' and 'older than X' is the difficult part to do reliably and correctly :)
[18:44:57] <wink> but I don't see an automatic solution, it's not liek log files
[18:45:15] <rwb> keep around the images i'm using
[18:45:15] <wink> so I prefer it filling up over randomly deleting tbh
[18:45:19] <rwb> don't keep around the images i'm not using
[18:45:22] <q3k> i think what rwb is arguing for is that this should've been better thought out from the get go by the docker abstraction
[18:45:29] <wink> agreed
[18:45:37] <wink> but I think it's not a wtf moment
[18:45:46] <wink> you habe to know that it's not automatic. end of story
[18:45:53] <q3k> and that's also what i agree with, and my general opinion of docker-on-prod is that it lures you with seeming simplicity but leaves you to deal with stupid crap like that
[18:46:14] <rwb> i think docker could just have a simple lru setup where the least recently used /dangling/ image would be yeeted above X% disk usage
[18:46:19] <q3k> and now there's thousands of engineering hours being wasted into everyone re-discovering this issue and having to invent a way to deal with it
[18:46:40] <wink> yeah it's never simple and in general I am not a docker fan.
[18:46:50] <rwb> when it works it's great
[18:46:54] <rwb> when it doesn't work it's despair
[18:47:13] <rwb> thankfully most of the time it's in the "it works" territory
[18:47:28] <q3k> i'm happy to alt least have replcaed docker with contained on my production hosts
[18:47:48] <q3k> that removes a lot of the other weird docker behaviours that bit me
[18:47:55] <q3k> like fiddling with iptables, grr
[18:47:57] <wink> I am not responsible for any real prod atm and for my toy stuff docker-compose is fine
[18:48:18] <rwb> hmm how does k8s handle this issue? you mentioned something about kubelet?
[18:48:27] <q3k> kubelet has a cofnigurable image recycler
[18:48:35] <rwb> yesterday i managed to get a basic thing up on minikube but i've not tried it out for production yet
[18:48:53] <q3k> which it can do because it's aware of the use of images at a higher level than just what's being used locally
[18:49:03] <rwb> right
[18:49:04] <q3k> so it knows to not delete an image if it's just about to pull something in
[18:49:18] <q3k> *if it's just about to pull it in
[18:49:51] <rwb> aside: it seems like you can't have the docker-compose experience where you just map your project folder into the container with a volume and have it Just Work:tm:, and need a 3rd party solution like okteta
[18:50:14] <rwb> unless i'm missing something, but i searched quite a while and that seems to be the "best solution"
[18:50:19] <rwb> definitely not a fan of that
[18:50:34] <q3k> yeah dev containers with docker never work well
[18:51:01] <q3k> the main problem being a) uid/gid mapping between host and container b) potential path differences between host and container c) people who insist on using macOS
[18:51:07] <rwb> worked fine enough for me with docker, tbf
[18:51:09] <rwb> lol
[18:51:20] <q3k> right, but the proble mis when you actually want it to work reliably for a larger team
[18:51:25] <rwb> on linux i could just map the project root into /app and it would have hot reload etc.
[18:51:28] <rwb> ah right
[18:51:31] <Foxboron> q3k: that's a docker issue. This works fine on podman or toolbox
[18:51:42] <q3k> podman only solves the uid/gid mapping on user containers
[18:51:45] <rwb> one day i will have n > 1 people working on a project, hopefully
[18:51:48] <q3k> on the other hand, it doesn't work on macos at all then
[18:52:02] <q3k> and toolbox is also linux only
[18:52:02] <Foxboron> q3k: macos is a problem you can't solve :p
[18:52:16] <q3k> but yeah, it seems like toolbox is something closer to what i'd expect
[18:52:22] <rwb> macos problem is easy to solve, you install GNU/linux into a VM and use that instead
[18:52:23] <Foxboron> "My linux tools doesn't work on my non-linux OS"
[18:52:35] <q3k> and yeah, my solution to macos is to simply not have developers use macos, but not everyone can afford to make this decision in their dev team :P
[18:52:44] <rwb> true
[18:52:51] <q3k> rwb: but people then want to use their host vscode/textmate to develop
[18:52:58] <rwb> true
[18:53:04] <Foxboron> I also find bindmounting my workfolder into a given container usually also works. The path differences is usually stuff you can work around
[18:53:05] <q3k> and then you have to deal with the infinite fractal of pain that is host/vm directory sharing
[18:53:15] <q3k> Foxboron: i mean, i know, i've worked around this multiple times :P
[18:53:17] <rwb> the new guy i'll be working with is gonna be setting up a new team (basically just starting out the company), and was about to go for macs
[18:53:20] <Foxboron> q3k: :)

[18:57:42] <q3k> my view has always been that devs should just run an OS as close as possible to the target deployment environment

[19:55:01] <JordiGH> What do you think the world would be like if IRC had become the dominant protocol instead of HTTP and we'd all be using mIRCscript in the server via Node.ms?
[19:55:15] <mockturtle> Responsiveness under Working Conditions [networking performance] (sergeyb) https://lobste.rs/s/riwkcl
[19:55:21] <JordiGH> I wonder what the standardisation effort of mIRCscript would look like.
[19:55:49] <JordiGH> It would still be called Ecmascript, I guess.
[19:56:21] <rwb> edk: obvio
[19:56:23] <JordiGH> We'd be mocking mIRC colour codes the way we mock <font> and <blink> tags.
[19:57:00] <rwb> JordiGH: i'm having chest pains imagining the chunking systems used for fitting packets within 512 bytes
[19:57:12] <edk> we already fit packets within 1500-ish bytes
[19:57:34] <rwb> yeah but that's transparent, now you have to do it at application protocol level too
[19:57:42] <rwb> layer 8
[19:58:04] <JordiGH> Whenever I think of numbered layers I still think of Serial Experiments Lain episodes.
[19:58:09] <edk> yeah, but there might be libraries that do it for you
[19:58:15] <rwb> LAYER
[19:58:17] <rwb> ZERO
[19:58:19] <rwb> TWO
[19:58:48] <rwb> edk: hmm so we have ethernet packets, ip packets, tcp packets, irc packets
[19:58:52] <rwb> that's a lot of packets
[19:58:59] <rwb> i'm happy with having the bottom three be the only ones
[19:59:17] <edk> don't forget TLS records
[19:59:27] <edk> also all of those things have their own names so you need a new name for IRC packets too
[19:59:33] <rwb> why do you have to add to my pain
[19:59:34] <edk> ethernet frame, ip packet, tcp segment, tls record
[20:00:00] <rwb> anyway obligatory https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0R--_ATzE6o
[20:00:01] <mockturtle> [ Introducing “VoIRC” - voice-chat over IRC ] - www.youtube.com
[20:00:06] <edk> irc could just be lines i guess
[20:02:30] <edk> hmm, even then packet is still overloaded; we don't know if it refers to an assembled packet or a packet fragment
[20:02:40] <JordiGH> How does IRC over TLS work anyway?
[20:03:08] <edk> same way anything else over TLS works, i guess
[20:03:11] <rwb> but honestly i feel sad that protocols extending irc never took of
[20:03:13] <q3k> you open a TCP socker, you establish a TLS session, then you throw IRC over it
[20:03:19] <edk> yeah
[20:03:24] <q3k> it's not rocket surgery
[20:03:37] <rwb> irc could totally be a layer under a chat application providing a more "modern" experience
[20:03:39] <edk> you just slot TLS between your TCP and your application protocol just like you would for any other thing
[20:03:41] <q3k> you can `openssl s_client -connect irc.libera.chat:6667`
[20:03:50] <q3k> or 6697 or wherever
[20:03:52] <edk> 6697
[20:04:11] <edk> in theory you can also starttls to irc.libera.chat, but i don't think s_client understand the IRC protocol well enough
[20:04:11] <q3k> and then just USER foo bar baz
[20:04:14] <q3k> NICK barfoo
[20:04:18] <q3k> JOIN #lobsters
[20:04:26] <q3k> and respond to pings fast ennough
[20:04:38] <q3k> edk: does anyone even starttls for irc?
[20:04:47] <q3k> maybe IRCv3 does
[20:04:58] <q3k> but these days just use normal plain TLS
[20:06:21] <edk> ircv3 doesn't like it. but there are some clients that do for various reasons
[20:06:37] <epilys[m]> q3k: socket surgery
[20:07:28] <q3k> it's only socket surgery if it uses tcp_repair, otherwise it's just sparkling so_reusaddr
[20:08:07] <edk> in particular you can automatically upgrade plain connections using starttls when you detect it, and it lets you see a plaintext error message explaining why the irc server refuses to speak tls with you
[20:09:02] <epilys[m]> maybe add the -crlf flag for openssl s_client
[20:09:54] <q3k> yeah, but opportunistic TLS encryption is about as secure as lack of TLS encryption, unless you have a threat model where your traffic can be sniffed but not tampered with
[20:10:11] <edk> almost everyone should have that threat model tbh
[20:10:20] <q3k> so IMO you shouldn't use opportunistic encryption, you should require encryption if you want encryption
[20:10:24] <edk> seeing as some large proportion of all internet traffic is passively sniffed
[20:10:29] <q3k> and for that ,just talk TLS directly
[20:10:56] <q3k> edk: if you think it's just pasively sniffed i have some bad news for you
[20:11:10] <q3k> (if we're talking state actors)
[20:11:25] <edk> lots of it is just passively sniffed; i realise that many states can actively mitm too
[20:12:29] <q3k> most isps in most countries are required by law to provide traffic interception (including modification) measures on demand to law enforcement
[20:12:30] <letoram> active MiM, quantumleap like hijacking, plaintext recovery from sidechannel analysis, "just route the traffic through me"-VPN, ... - are way below nation state level shenanigans
[20:12:51] <q3k> and yeah, not to mention large scale quantumleap-style injection/hijacks

[20:14:51] <mockturtle> Preface to an Unwritten Programming Language Book [book programming] (j11g) https://lobste.rs/s/aoopm4
[20:15:45] <edk> "on demand to law enforcement" only concerns you if you think a state is interested in you specifically; passive sniffing attacks against TLS don't know whether the TLS is opportunistic or not
[20:16:32] <edk> i'm very suspicious of VPN providers in general, but i doubt they would want to get caught stripping TLS
[20:17:04] <edk> given their marketing and business model it would be terminal
[20:17:12] <q3k> it doesn't have to be you specifically, it can totally be as part of a larger operation concerning an entire geographical area of users
