[05:54:32] <ajak> is there a way to make mutt not use my hostname in message-id?
[05:57:50] <ajak> oh, message_id_format
[05:58:04] <ajak> so i guess my question is what's a sane format to set it to to avoid my hostname being in message-id?

[08:07:54] <rwp> ajak, As long as it is globally unique and contains only the valid characters then it doesn't matter.
[08:10:03] <rwp> The mutt manual describes what characters are allow and the default setting.
[08:10:33] <ajak> thanks, i've set it to "<%z@$SMTP_SERVER>"
[08:10:37] <rwp> I didn't realize that message_id_format was available and set a custom one using my_hdr and a send-hook differently for different mailing lists.
[08:10:58] <ajak> why would it differ between mailing lists?
[08:12:18] <rwp> Here is where things got interesting: https://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2013/03/msg00571.html
[08:12:24] <rwp> But also https://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2013/03/msg00625.html
[08:12:28] <rwp> And https://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2013/03/msg00626.html
[08:12:55] <rwp> Brian had a good idea and I implemented it in my mutt configuration.

[21:50:02] <kevin8t8> ajak: that's not a good idea.  you should set the right-hand-side to something reasonably unique.

[21:51:45] <kevin8t8> mutt's %z is not designed with enough randomness to guarantee uniqueness across an entire large domain.
[21:52:15] <ajak> oh, then shouldn't it?
[21:54:02] <kevin8t8> ajak: no, it doesn't need to because the hostname on the rhs is sufficient
[21:54:42] <ajak> but your local hostname being in your mail is a bit awkward, no?
[21:55:23] <kevin8t8> ajak: not really.  email headers expose quite a bit of information.
[21:56:48] <ajak> but i seem to be pretty unique in exposing my local hostname via message-id
[21:57:59] <kevin8t8> not really.  the rhs traditionally is the hostname.
[22:01:39] <kevin8t8> ajak: there's quite a long thread on mutt-dev archive about message-id and some of these topics.  I'm just advising you not to change the rhs to your smtp host unless you want to generate the lhs yourself using a much larger random space.
[22:02:29] <kevin8t8> ajak: sorry I have to run, but look through mutt-dev archives if you want to see lots of debate on the topic.
[22:05:24] <ajak> kevin8t8: no worries, thanks for the info!
[22:12:22] <rwp> I assumed you must have been running your own smtp host, not something like @gmail.com or anything shared.
[22:13:20] <rwp> Seems like you could add your Gmail login to the id string to namespace it and that should be sufficient. Which is already elsewhere in the headers so doesn't expose any new information.
[22:15:21] <ajak> you mean something like '<%z@$SMTP_USER.$SMTP_SERVER>'?
