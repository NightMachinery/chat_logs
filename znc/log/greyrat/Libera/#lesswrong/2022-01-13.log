[02:04:35] <two2thehead> "This tendency, we argue, extends beyond what would be explained by propinquity, and we expect that victimization by friends will be particularly distressing. We test these hypotheses using panel social network data from 14 middle and high schools at two time points during a school year. Findings from temporal exponential random graph models suggest that our expectations are correct: the tendency to be cruel to friends is not significantly 
[02:04:35] <two2thehead> influenced by propinquity, and victimization by friends has adverse consequences for mental health."
[02:05:08] <two2thehead> Hypothesis, you can detect bullies by their big five traits, and also by their dark tetrad test
[02:05:52] <two2thehead> sooo... if we duplicate the above, *but* make the subjects do personality tests, that would predict the bullies
[02:10:29] <two2thehead> "But while role contests—for prom queen, starting quarterback, or class president—may draw socially distant adversaries, homophily and transitivity imply that the competition for relationships—to be the best friend of a popular student, to lead a clique, to be invited on a friend’s family ski vacation—will put friends (and friends-of-friends) at odds with each other. They are eyeing the same rungs on the social ladder, and the
[02:10:29] <two2thehead>  zero-sum nature of these rivalries can spur gossip, betrayals of confidence, and other forms of social sabotage, all justified by the memories of past slights and snubs"

[02:14:35] <two2thehead> Hypothesis, there's got to be a way of measuring threats-to-self-esteem. And those who are less threatened, ceteris paribus, will score higher on the opposite of the dark tetrad ie the light tetrad

People sometimes go about saying now, in this community, that there is collectively enough money that we could potentially go do more things with it, if there were things worth doing. If that's true, I'd like to see us planting seed …)
[02:56:06] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : "Second, just as friends struggle for control, friends-of-friends strive for the attention and affection of their mutual friends, particularly when their friend’s friendships threaten to supersede their own, a common experience among adolescents, and one that is associated with aggressive behavior (Parker et al. 2005). Moreover, these skirmishes are uninhibited by amity or the bonds of friendship. Finally, if relationship
[02:56:06] <two2thehead> s are the currency of status, then structurally equivalent youth occupy identical status positions (unlike friends, who may have different degrees of social status, depending on other friends they do not share in common). The resulting ambiguity allows each to sustain contradictory understandings of their relative rank, a potentially explosive situation (Gould 2003)."
[02:56:16] <two2thehead> This is *very* accurate imo
[02:56:42] <two2thehead> especially if you are discussing say important things like politics, or in my case geostrategy
[02:57:36] <two2thehead> ie you need to maintain and assert boundaries and since the internet allows you to stick your nose into any random conversations, ceteris paribus, odds are high that you will get into an argument with a friend of your friend

[03:38:23] <feepbot> absolutely insane to me, but I didn’t say anything about it, because you never know if your family’s dysfunction is atypical or if everyone else is just lying about their happy lives. I pictured this classmate seated on the floor of a living room, one much bigger than mine, playing Parcheesi with her bookish parents. This image persisted, and for the next year, I felt a great

[16:50:17] <Gurkenglas> (would this make the control group feel extra-in-the-know and perform well? :S)
[16:54:40] <Gurkenglas> i guess per person you could roll two uniform random numbers p, q between 0 and 1, tell them they're in the control group, and then tell them the other group is getting water if they ask why they were told *or* if p<q. Then you can see how much performance correlates with q without ever not being honest to someone who asks.

[17:44:07] <PapuaHardyNet> the GCP support message does not make me confident that they'll accept that one now though: "Unfortunately, we cannot re-open your Your Google Cloud Platform / API billing account due to ongoing suspicious activity that appears to violate our Terms of Service."
[17:44:12] <PapuaHardyNet> "We take the safety and security of individuals using the Google Cloud Platform very seriously, and consequently all projects associated with this billing account will also remain suspended.
[17:44:54] <PapuaHardyNet> " the "ongoing" word is the key here. they might decline my new debit card with my name on it too. I could, however make an entirely new Google account and attempt to use that.

[20:46:56] <pompolic> i wouldn't say "fomo" but i do wish i had capacity for attending events like this
[20:48:02] <catern> hm
[20:48:09] <catern> I wonder what literal heretics were like
[20:48:38] <catern> were they cringe kooks in the same way that the average right-wing heretic today is a cringe kook
[20:49:47] <pompolic> heresy "is cringe" yes
[20:50:35] <pompolic> (that is to say, the feeling of cringe is probably just one's heresy/social norm violation classifier firing)
[20:52:30] <catern> no
[20:52:56] <pompolic> well it's definitely not the property of the cringe thing
[20:52:58] <catern> i mean the average heretic today is usually unusual in other ways independent of their heresy
[20:53:06] <pompolic> right
[20:53:09] <catern> can't believe i have to explain this
[20:53:44] <pompolic> am i supposed to cringe in shame
[20:54:30] <catern> e.g. someone who has a revolutionary theory which disproves Einstein is usually contemptible for other reasons too
[20:54:52] <catern> stupid, poor, generally low status
[20:55:13] <catern> or just unusual in general in ways that deviate from the norm == low status
[20:55:16] <catern> == cringe
[20:55:46] <catern> so back to my original question, I wonder if  1200s Christian heretics had the same property
[20:55:54] <pompolic> "deviation" i think gets close to the core of it
[20:56:31] <catern> this is an empirical question about history, theorizing is useless
[20:56:47] <pompolic> fair enough
[20:57:04] <pompolic> then i'll skip to: "i think so"
[20:58:48] <pompolic> i started looking into Jan Hus to check my intuition
[20:59:04] <pompolic> not the 1200s, but the 1400s
[20:59:47] <pompolic> he got admitted to university, so i suppose he can't have been too low status
[21:01:21] <pompolic> but on the other hand, the 3 top results also say he was born to a peasant family (although with very little information available)

[21:42:54] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: hm... I thought they'd all be the same size, but it seems like it's still many different lid sizes and just that they stack so they don't roll around loose?
[21:43:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> yes
[21:44:06] <catern> it sounds suboptimal still, i'm thinking of just getting some stackable deep largish dishes and getting lids that will work for those dishes
[21:44:39] <catern> then I have only one kind of lid (and also I can use them as regular dishes)
[21:45:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: What kinds of food do you store
[21:45:42] <catern> pizza mostly lol
[21:45:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> ...
[21:46:38] <catern> if it's other takeout it usually comes in something that can fit in my refrigerator; if I make it myself I usually store it in what I made it in
[21:47:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> I use ziploc bags and mason jars for long-term storage
[21:47:38] <catern> good point, i'm not talking long-term storage, this is just for leftovers
[21:47:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> I use plain old saucepans for short-term stuff
[21:48:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> I put a paper towel between the pan and the lid to create a seal
[21:48:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And absorb evaporation)
[21:48:34] <catern> interesting... isn't that kind of large to fit in your refrigerator? like what kind of saucepan are we talking about
[21:48:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Various sizes
[21:48:43] <catern> is that what you'd do to store, say, pizza?
[21:48:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't store pizza
[21:48:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's heresy
[21:48:57] <catern> like, saucepans have a handle, which seems like it would get in the way
[21:49:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> no
[21:49:02] <catern> okay then pasta lol

[21:49:21] <catern> the saucepan handles don't get in the way?
[21:49:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe they're not called "saucepans"
[21:49:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> English words for this are weird and awkward
[21:50:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> I guess "saucepan" implies single handle that is normal to the pan side
[21:51:05] <catern> definitely curious to know what you're talking about then, is this like... a caserole?
[21:51:20] <catern> casserole even

[22:23:06] <catern> good point about "stuff the whole box in"
[22:23:16] <catern> I guess maybe my *real* issue is that I need a bigger refrigerator

[22:25:45] <kuudes> that is often the issue
[22:28:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... is # a regexp metacharacter?
[22:30:46] <catern> running an optimization where more things are free variables instead of fixed allows for better outcomes
[22:30:56] <catern> is there a fancy name for this principle?
[22:31:24] <catern> (sorry, where more things are free to vary*** not "free variables" lol)
[22:36:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... wait a minute
[22:37:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> If you mount a remote volume and it has a symlink on it somewhere, that symlink will be interpreted as pointing to a location on your local file system???
[22:37:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> My god Unix is primitive
[22:37:36] <pompolic> unix be like, RETVRN
[22:38:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> I keep being surprised by this sort of thing... like, I wouldn't've even imagined that this sort of basic nonsense could happen on a real OS / filesystem used by grownups
[22:38:13] <adiabatic> #newjerseystyle
[22:38:32] <saturn2> that depends on the filesystem
[22:38:52] <pompolic> "return to where?" you might ask. whichever address ends up on the stack after a buffer overflow of course
[22:38:54] <spxtr> worse is better - that symlink behavior is probably very simple to implement
[22:39:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> spxtr: Mac OS had a superior solution in like 1986.
[22:39:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> "very simple to implement" might suffice as an excuse in the short term but not for three and a half fucking decades
[22:40:12] <gwern> (I've never seen '#' as a regexp metacharacter. I *have* run into issues with regexps where # caused problems because it triggered comments lol)
[22:41:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Even back in the actual 1980s, if you clicked on a Finder alias to a file on a remote volume, the Finder would in fact *connect to the appropriate server and mount that volume for you* and resolve the alias and open whatever it was pointing to
[22:41:16] <pompolic> "symlinks are assumed to point to the local FS" is probably a safer default to be fair. and i can imagine all sorts of abuse if symlinks could access network resources, at least
[22:41:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> pompolic: And yet Finder aliases do this and work fine and there have never been problems with it
[22:42:19] <pompolic> yet
[22:42:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Indeed this is even the simpler case: it's a symlink pointing to a location on a volume I already have mounted! The same volume that the symlink itself is on!
[22:42:48] <pompolic> yeah as i was writing it i realized it ruled out the first thing i thought of
[22:42:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> But instead it gets resolved as pointing to something on my local filesystem, i.e., NOT the volume the symlink is on
[22:43:00] *** Joins: janus__ (~janus__@86.106.121.90)
[22:43:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which is just maximally idiotic behavior
[22:43:15] <pompolic> which is "attacker stealthily "remounts" the network volume" (which you could simulate by some ARP and DNS fuckery)
[22:43:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's not even a "limitation", it's just stupidity
[22:43:53] <pompolic> yeah it's also stupid to implement it like that
[22:45:18] <pompolic> now i'm wondering about something. i'm not even sure how to verbalize it
[22:45:55] <pompolic> but tl;dr on unix/linux, "everything is a file", your volumes are subdirectories of /, and some of them happen to be backed by the network

[22:46:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> (This is probably tangential to what you're saying but I've always been annoyed by the whole "on Unix everything is a file" rhetoric. It's not true. On Classic Mac OS, everything was a file. On Unix, some things are not files but are in fact some bullshit)
[22:46:56] <pompolic> i was going to say, yeah, a default of "symlink refers to the same volume unless otherwise specified" would maybe be sane
[22:47:08] <pompolic> i quoted it because it's just so blatantly untrue
[22:47:11] * gwern checks in on danbooru2021. 22k downloaded out of 166k missing /sigh
[22:47:18] <pompolic> it == "everything is a file"
[22:47:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> One of the things that I have never gotten over is how Mac OS X killed the "everything is a file" nature of Classic Mac OS
[22:48:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Still mad about it, 20+ years later
[22:48:12] <saturn2> symlinks don't point to volumes they just point to paths
[22:48:20] <pompolic> trying to imagine the implementor's perspective here; i think everything being under / is causally upstream of this default you're complaining about. (this is not meant to be a justification, though)
[22:48:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Yes, well, it's dumb
[22:48:26] <pompolic> saturn2: +1
[22:49:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's one thing to have that sort of facility, it's another thing to have that and then NOT have a proper alias system
[22:49:30] <saturn2> even on a single computer, if you have a symlink to /foo/bar and  you mount something else on /foo, it changes what the link points to
[22:49:59] <pompolic> seems to me part of the problem is people not realizing paths are an abstraction
[22:50:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Right, well, again, that's dumb, because it leads to that sort of behavior, which is almost never what I or any sane person wants
[22:50:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> pompolic: No the problem is that nobody cares about "paths", what people care about is things and places
[22:50:43] <pompolic> yeah, i think they are probably not a very good abstraction
[22:50:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> "paths" are one way to specify things in places, and not a very good one
[22:50:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Right
[22:51:13] <spxtr> programmers care about paths, almost all actual users do not deal with symlinks except for the ones on their desktop pointing to exes
[22:51:17] <pompolic> i haven't seen a more object-oriented approach that was good and not a nightmare
[22:51:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> spxtr: Programmers do not - unless forced to (by a system that does not permit more sensible ways of referring to things and places)
[22:51:55] <pompolic> but if i were to implement things from scratch, i can't say i would use paths
[22:52:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> pompolic: Some of the Cocoa APIs are good in this regard, though they don't really generalize
[22:52:21] <spxtr> paths can be fed through pipes and so on. stringly-typed, sure, but very easy to deal with
[22:52:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> spxtr: That's bad! Pipes are bad! "everything is text" IS BAD
[22:52:57] <pompolic> +1
[22:53:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> "stringly typed" in fact makes them *harder* to deal with!
[22:53:10] <saturn2> it makes more sense if you think of the filesystem as a namespace rather than just a "place to put stuff"
[22:53:36] <catern> everything is text is bad, stringly typed is bad
[22:53:37] <pompolic> i wonder if IPFS and ilk managed to innovate on it
[22:53:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: That's probably true but that's one of those "but that's worse... you understand that's worse, right" things
[22:53:48] <catern> that's why my game will not be a text adventure, but an object adventure
[22:53:49] <spxtr> works well enough for s3

[22:54:14] <Robomot> text/plain (331 bytes)
[22:54:44] <pompolic> i also often find myself thinking what i really want is content-addressed (or content-indexed?) storage?
[22:54:55] <pompolic> new project: booruFS
[22:55:13] <pompolic> s/storage?/storage/
[22:56:46] <pompolic> when i think more on it, "files" is some skeumorphic-ass nonsense anyway
[22:57:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> no!
[22:57:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's not what skeuomorphism is!
[22:58:11] <pompolic> i mean, ultimately you want some basic datum unit
[22:58:27] <gwern> files... directories... pages... Trash/Recycling Bin... sounds like a skeumorphic *filing cabinet* nonsense to me
[22:58:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Files are emphatically *not* skeuomorphic, because they are specifically designed to mimic the *behavior* of real-world objects, in such a way that intuitions about objects may be mapped onto files *and generate correct predictions* about their behavior
[22:58:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> That is not skeuomorphism, that is good design
[22:58:46] <pompolic> alright, i accept your argument
[22:58:50] <pompolic> folders then?
[22:58:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> no.
[22:58:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Same argument.
[22:59:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> (When implemented properly, anyway, such as in Classic Mac OS)
[23:00:10] <saturn2> the star trek computer didn't have files
[23:00:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> The Star Trek computer was a horrible mess of bad design
[23:00:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Starting with those damn touch screens
[23:01:13] <pompolic> your index into the whole thing being a DAG (well, a directed graph at least) is probably not the best, at least
[23:01:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> What do you mean "index into the whole thing"
[23:01:51] <pompolic> so, absent a filesystem, you have something like a sea of bytes
[23:02:06] <pompolic> having a "file" unit for data makes sense
[23:02:20] <spxtr> we should just do away with folders and such and go with what s3 does: your filesystem is simply a mapping from nearly-arbitrary strings to the data. slashes and hierarchies are meaningless
[23:02:23] <pompolic> having groups of files also makes sense
[23:02:25] <saturn2> i think the touch screens were just there to give you something to do with your hands, and the computer was actually reading your mind
[23:02:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> spxtr: no
[23:02:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: That interpretation is falsified by the time Data had to do stuff fast and so he tapped the screen in super speed
[23:03:10] <saturn2> oh damn
[23:03:38] <pompolic> i was also thinking about things like Obsidian, which is just a graph db for individual nodes
[23:03:45] <pompolic> rather than a hierarchical representation
[23:04:11] <saturn2> but how come they never accidentally launched photon torpedoes by leaning against a console
[23:04:13] <pompolic> although i don't think hierarchy is a bad abstraction per se
[23:04:45] <saturn2> maybe the mind reading is just a confirmation
[23:05:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: I mean, that's easy enough, even iPhones can prevent that sort of thing
[23:05:21] <pompolic> so overall: i think a filesystem (and abstractions like paths) are about how you index your individual datum-units
[23:05:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> pompolic: Have you read John Siracusa's commentary on the spatial Finder?
[23:05:42] <pompolic> no, but that sounds interesting
[23:05:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> You should
[23:05:49] <pompolic> will do
[23:05:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> It explains why the view you describe is misguided
[23:05:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Among other things)
[23:07:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Do you still use those RSS feeds I made like the Browser, National Affairs, etc.?
[23:07:51] <gwern> my rss reader tries but always fails because of your https problems
[23:08:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> ah
[23:08:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Would you use them if I fixed said problems?
[23:08:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or are they made obsolete somehow
[23:10:25] <gwern> I don't think I used The Browser one, and I just forwarded my emails to a rss gateway. I'd still like the National Affairs one to work
[23:10:33] <pompolic> the claims i intended to make were "a filesystem is a (hierarchical) index" (and i think paths are a way to flatten paths in that hierarchical representation into a string), and "the 'usual' representation of this index is probably not that good"
[23:10:54] <pompolic> is one or both of these what you're referring to as misguided?
[23:11:25] <Obormot\Gaia> pompolic: As far as the latter goes, I guess it depends on what you mean by "the usual representation"
[23:12:27] <pompolic> a directed/hierarchical graph maybe. essentially files within folders within folders
[23:12:52] <Obormot\Gaia> As opposed to what, though
[23:13:31] <Obormot\Gaia> Like, along what dimension are you locating the "usual" point in representation-space and calling it "not that good"?
[23:14:26] <synthmeat> what's the english term for those elbow protection thingies that come on some shirts or jackets?
[23:14:27] <pompolic> i'm not entirely certain, i'm having trouble clarifying my intuitions even to myself. but i think it has to do with how the hierarchy is implemented
[23:14:56] <catern> it's impressive how gwern, despite being an independent researcher, has accrued a dedicated support team in the form of Obormot
[23:15:01] <pompolic> for one, where files are in relation to each other probably gets more prominence than it's due
[23:15:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: I'm not *that* dedicated... >_>
[23:15:23] <pompolic> however, i think the general notion of encoding relations between files is good
[23:15:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: But anyway, I consider it a public service
[23:15:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> My personal version of effective altruism
[23:15:56] <pompolic> gwernpastism-longtermism
[23:16:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Everyone who goes to gwern.net and gets more value out of it than they would if gwern's site was still the way it was before I laid hands on it, is helped by my efforts
[23:16:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> pompolic: Ok, yeah, definitely read Siracusa's stuff then
[23:17:09] <pompolic> alright
[23:17:12] <pompolic> crux located i think!
[23:17:35] <synthmeat> yeah, i keep wanna be bitchin' about Obormot\Arcturus and gwern spamming the chan with it, then i remember it's basically public service ^_^
[23:18:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> pompolic: The other half of what you said is also problematic, note
[23:18:09] <kuudes> hmm, what was the article again which included those handy charts of election fraud in russia?
[23:18:17] <gwern> catern: I'm just lucky with obormot. most writers never get such help and I certainly couldn't afford it, I'd have to develop the expertise myself - which might've been a good thing in the long run but sure would take a while
[23:18:17] <pompolic> thanks
[23:18:29] <pompolic> i wanted to know if that's what you were disagreeing with
[23:18:34] <kuudes> statistical analysis of mod 5 percentages etc
[23:18:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> pompolic: Like, the whole idea of *starting* with a bunch of files and then going "how shall we index this" is, in some ways, backwards
[23:18:40] <pompolic> (as opposed to me having failed to explain myself)
[23:19:06] <pompolic> huh, when you put it that way i kind of agree
[23:19:22] <kuudes> ah, https://danluu.com/discontinuities/
[23:19:22] <Robomot> Suspicious discontinuities
[23:19:34] <catern> gwern: not sure I would call it luck, seems like the direct result of your status/stature which is the result of your work
[23:19:53] <pompolic> when i think about it from an user perspective, what i really want is some helm/control center i can use to locate/manipulate data
[23:19:55] <gwern> catern: there are many writers or researchers roughly of my stature, but how many obormots?
[23:19:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> pompolic: Another way to put this is to say "structure is prior to data" [in human cognition]
[23:20:08] <pompolic> yeah
[23:20:22] <pompolic> i wanted to say "the index comes first" but that sounded stupid so i rejected it
[23:20:31] <gwern> catern: pretty much any writer or researcher you might think of with similar websites is doing the website themselves as a major focus: Bret Victor, Michael Nielsen, Andy Matsushack etc
[23:21:10] <catern> well, and there's the other direction: to what extent is your interest in making a good website a result of having Obormot available to help with it?
[23:21:24] <catern> not to undermine it or anything
[23:21:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> pompolic: Here's another way to approach thinking about this, which I will explain circuitously by means of an anecdote:
[23:23:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> One time some relatively-prominent philosopher dude came to my college's philosophy club to talk about his clever and fancy work on the Sorites paradox (apparently it was based on Aristotle somehow. can you imagine? in the actual 21st century, people getting paid to write papers and shit about the Sorites paradox and Aristotle! anyway...)
[23:24:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> So he was telling us about various interpretations of the whole thing; and I (the only computer science major in the room) pointed out to him that all the usual philosophical takes miss something important, namely: suppose you have the set { 1, 2, 3, 4 }; and you remove, one by one, the elements 4, 3, 2, and 1 - what are you left with?
[23:24:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not *nothing*, right?
[23:25:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> You're left with the empty set!
[23:25:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> This amazing insight from set theory 101 was, as it turns out, totally novel to this professor of philosophy from Some Fancy School, and he was all like "huh I never thought of it like that before"
[23:26:22] <gwern> catern: oh, most of it. if I had to pay full freight in terms of learning JS/CSS from scratch, I would absolutely not bother to learn as much about typography or design
[23:26:31] <pompolic> Obormot\Arcturus: :D
[23:26:34] <pompolic> i think i get it
[23:26:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> (This is the same as "the programmer's reply" to the Sorites paradox, which is mentioned in the Sequences somewhere)
[23:26:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> And note that we can go further: { } != { { } }, etc.
[23:27:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, just as you can have an empty set and that is not the same as nothing, similarly you can have an empty folder, which is not the same as having a totally empty volume
[23:27:53] <pompolic> if i'm correctly understanding you, your point can be restated as "the container should also be a first-class object" 
[23:27:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> And you can have empty folders containing more empty folders, and, crucially, *this structure can be semantically meaningful*
[23:28:13] <pompolic> no disagreement there either
[23:28:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> pompolic: Indeed we can even go further and say that the container should be the *only* first-class object! ... but that is perhaps going too far (or is it?)
[23:28:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> pompolic: Here is another anecdote, this time directly from OS / file system design:
[23:29:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> In the Classic Mac OS Finder, you had the System Folder, right, and it had your System file, your Finder file, your Extensions folder (with all your installed Extensions), etc.
[23:30:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Among other things, the System Folder contained the Fonts folder, wherein were all your installed fonts; and each font was a "font suitcase", which you could open up just like any other folder, and inside would be like the regular and italic and bold variants of a font, etc.
[23:30:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> But, interesting, font suitcases *were not folders* - they were files!
[23:31:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> You could open them *as* folders, in the Finder, and this made sense UX-wise because that was a perfectly sensible way of interacting with their contents
[23:31:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> And, in the other direction, a .app file on the Mac OS now is actually an "application bundle", which presents as a file but is "actually" a folder (you can *also* open it up in the Finder and view its contents)
[23:31:59] <pompolic> that makes me think of things like Doom WADs
[23:32:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> So what is the difference between a "file" that is actually a folder (and which you can open up in your file manager and view its contents), and a "folder" that is actually a file (and which you can also open up in your file manager and view its contents)?
[23:32:52] <pompolic> your filesystem's opinion, maybe
[23:32:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> The question is rhetorical, of course (the actual difference boils down to various technical implementation details)
[23:32:59] <pompolic> :D
[23:33:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> But the point is that there's no reason why there must be a hard and fast distinction
[23:33:29] <pompolic> i was thinking there is some map-territory confusion in filesystems (if you allow me to a bit sloppy with the concept of "territory")
[23:33:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Fundamentally it's the container that's conceptually primary, because the container is the unit of organization
[23:33:41] <pompolic> clearly, containers/folders are part of the map
[23:33:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Clearly, but so are file systems
[23:33:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> The territory is quarks
[23:33:57] <pompolic> yeah
[23:34:11] <pompolic> that's why i said i was being sloppy
[23:34:42] <pompolic> it seems common to pick a level of abstraction as "the territory", when programming
[23:35:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, but what should motivate the choice? If your answer is "whatever happens to be convenient to me as an implementor", then you're clearly not thinking in user-centered terms
[23:35:48] <pompolic> so i guess i should just abandon this analogy and say instead, "files and folders in the same class is an abstraction leak"
[23:35:56] <pompolic> yeah
[23:38:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> pompolic: Note that we haven't even started to get into any of the really cool or innovative or clever things that one can do with the file/folder abstraction, like Folder Actions, persistent positioning and per-folder decoration, WikiFolders, etc., etc.
[23:38:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> If you are thinking of "files, and and index into them" then none of those things will ever occur to you, nor will you be able to build them
[23:38:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> *and an
[23:39:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Or folders as launchers, and more generally every kind of "file management as implementation layer for features/interactions")
[23:40:05] <pompolic> right
[23:41:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Note further that the more intuitive and spatial / object-oriented you make your file system, the more you make it possible for non-programmer power users to do cool things with it
[23:41:21] <pompolic> my general sentiment is something like "too bad the index is an afterthought and downstream of implementation"
[23:41:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, cases where that is true are invariably cascades of bad UX design
[23:41:57] <pompolic> that's also my personal angle on it. i prefer to organize things visually/spatially
[23:42:35] <adiabatic> pompolic: I've used WADs a bunch but never dove into any. What were they like inside?
[23:43:02] <pompolic> i don't know much, but as far as i know they're basically asset databases
[23:43:23] <pompolic> i also know there were limitations from things hardcoded into the Doom engine
[23:43:33] <pompolic> but it enabled third-party tools like DeHackEd

[23:44:43] <Robomot> The Unofficial Doom Specs v1.666...
[23:45:22] <pompolic> "lumps" of data + an index it seems
[23:46:04] <pompolic> the lumps are typed
[23:46:16] <adiabatic> sounds like it was named well

[23:46:38] <pompolic> damn
[23:46:40] <pompolic> i think i will
[23:47:07] <pompolic> need to put sidequest back on it
[23:47:34] <ggreer> it looks like it'd cause tons of motion sickness, but I'm glad people are doing all kinds of crazy stuff with VR
[23:48:36] <pompolic> oh yeah
[23:48:43] <pompolic> i have a list of crazy projects myself
[23:49:25] <saturn2> you're taking for granted one of the most frustrating limitations of currently popular systems, that files can only be organized by one piece of metadata at a time (a pathname)
[23:51:48] <pompolic> am i? because i feel like that is part of what i had been meaning to say with things like "booruFS"
[23:52:03] <pompolic> +1, at any rate
[23:52:25] <pompolic> paths need to check their privilege
[23:52:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Mac OS does have some capabilities that go beyond that, though not nearly as effective as the possible ones described in Siracusa's spatial Finder proposal
