[07:29:23] <cads> How would I implement "Py-Enriched" categories in python?
[07:29:45] <cads> what does it mean for a category to be py enriched?
[07:30:37] <cads> conceptually, if we have an object A in a Py-category C, we should be able to get a python object _A
[07:33:10] <cads> and if we have a morphism f: A -> B, perhaps we could expect a function _A._f: _A -> _B
[07:39:44] <cads> Let a:_A be a judgement in Py saying that object a is an instance of _A. a._f() : _B is then an instance of _B

[07:55:49] <cads> does Py have a cartesian product? Does it need a tensor product beyond the cartesian product?
[08:08:16] <cads> If it has cartesian products,  this would mean that for every Py class _A and _B we need a class _A _⊗ _B  such that for all classes _C with methods _C.f : _C -> _A and _C.g : _C -> _B, we have a unique method f,g : _C -> _A _⊗ _B such that f = c.(f,g).proj_A, g = c.(f,g).proj_B
[08:13:07] <cads> hmm, I think the method has to be unique up to output behavior
[08:22:31] <cads> I think I am confused about what Py-enrichment would entail for a category. I supposed that for every object in the enriched category, we should get a python object, and for every morphism we should get a python morphism. However I'm not sure that's true or quite so straightforward.
[08:37:19] <cads> "For every object we get a python object" ->   In reality we are assigning to every hom-set a hom-object, so it would seem we leave out the objects. But in particular we have hom(A, A), and a identity element id_A : I -> hom(A, A). We can think of this as A's representative in Py. But hom(A, A) may not embed A in the same sense that I supposed _A would.

[19:09:54] <zincy> Okay self studying topology is going to be more work than I thought
[19:10:37] <riv> which topology?
[19:10:46] <zincy> point set topology
[19:10:51] <riv> ah yes
[19:11:13] <zincy> Is it normal to hit points where you just get so confused you forget your own name
[19:11:18] <riv> hahaha
[19:11:23] <riv> with point set topology yes
[19:11:28] <riv> there are some beasts lurking there
[19:11:43] <zincy> As in I understand what open sets are, closed limit points
[19:11:49] <zincy> But when you put it all together wow
[19:12:12] <riv> have you looked at brouwers fixed point theorem?
[19:12:36] <zincy> I guess I know bits of the vocabulary but now with learning connectness and subspace topology
[19:12:43] <zincy> I am putting into all together
[19:12:46] <riv> nice
[19:12:59] <zincy> That is still very basic though haha
[19:13:25] <zincy> Yes I looked at Brouwers fixed point theorem and really want to understand it properly
[19:13:34] <riv> do you have much calculus? because a fair bit of topology is applied in real analysis and that's quite a good intuition driver I find
[19:13:45] <zincy> No 
[19:13:48] <riv> the fixed point theorem is a really striking result and it's quite approachable
[19:14:14] <zincy> My only maths is an elementary real analysis course on sequences, series and limits
[19:14:15] <riv> so just stuff like, a continuous function has no 'jumps' - how does that relate to inverse images of open sets being open? 
[19:14:35] <zincy> Yeah I learnt about continuity through topology
[19:14:36] <riv> oh yeah that's all you'd need
[19:15:05] <zincy> I havent done the epsilon delta proofs for continuity
[19:15:20] <zincy> Only the preimage of open sets is open method
[19:16:09] <zincy> Whats your math background riv?
[19:16:24] <riv> i majored in math
[19:16:32] <zincy> NIce
[19:16:36] <riv> now i just try to keep it up a bit with self study
[19:16:48] <riv> learned a little bit of algebraic topology for the first time yesterday
[19:16:53] <riv> always avoided that subject before
[19:17:01] <zincy> I want to learn algebra too (and algebraic topology too ... one day)
[19:17:06] <riv> :D
[19:17:09] <riv> algebra is my favorite
[19:17:10] <zincy> Homology, cohomology looks interesting
[19:17:21] <riv> that stuff is beyond me but yeah it seems very important
[19:18:11] <zincy> Yeah I am definitely excited about algebra
[19:19:48] <zincy> Learning proofs through analysis was a baptism by fire
[19:19:55] <riv> :P
[19:19:57] <riv> yeah
[19:20:25] <zincy> And then that course had some proofs about convergence of complex numbers too hahaha
[19:20:53] <riv> btw, for future you might like algebra chapter 0, or maclane & birkhoff 'algebra' - they're use category theory language a bit more than most algebra books
[19:21:14] <zincy> Great thanks!
[19:21:23] <zincy> Do you have other recommendations
[19:21:28] <zincy> I got pinters book
[19:22:23] <zincy> Oh wait you gave two books there that should be enough for now :)
[19:22:52] <riv> well it might scare you off, but "counterexamples in topology" is worth looking at. Maybe a good rec. for haloween
