[09:44:22] <iamak[m]> How to know if a kernel module has been disabled by kernel update?
[09:44:46] <iamak[m]> I had a mini heart attack coz mouse stopped working after kernel update before I realised module must be disabled
[09:45:11] <sla[m]12> iamak[m]: List out the loaded modules
[09:45:27] <iamak[m]> Not possible automatically?
[09:46:19] <sla[m]12> What is there to automate ?
[09:46:38] <labrador> good question lol
[09:47:04] <iamak[m]> Like a notification or sth when a kernel module get's disabled
[09:47:08] <sla[m]12> Maybe write a pacman hook thats runs on kernel update
[09:47:08] <iamak[m]> I am noob lol idk
[09:47:16] <iamak[m]> I am just asking so I can avoid situations like this
[09:47:38] <sla[m]12> sla[m]12: Save the list of loaded modules and print diff with previous
[09:47:52] <iamak[m]> Okay thanks

[10:15:11] <gtlsgamr> Hi guys
[10:15:18] <gtlsgamr> looking for cheap vps
[10:15:23] <gtlsgamr> any suggestion?
[10:15:43] <sla[m]12> still linode
[10:15:47] <sla[m]12> :P
[10:15:59] <gtlsgamr> fuckin hell
[10:16:01] <gtlsgamr> it is 5 usd
[10:16:09] <gtlsgamr> i dont want to spend 5 usd for a vps
[10:16:24] <labrador> gtlsgamr, thats what you get for living in india :p
[10:16:33] <labrador> Everything is too expensive
[10:16:44] <sla[m]12> gtlsgamr: Ha
[10:16:46] <labrador> Domain --> 15usd a year
[10:16:56] <labrador> VPS --> 10usd a year
[10:16:58] <gtlsgamr> domain i get for 8usd a year thats affordable
[10:17:03] <labrador> gtlsgamr, nice
[10:17:08] <gtlsgamr> vps is 60 usd a year
[10:17:13] <gtlsgamr> actually 72
[10:17:15] <labrador> oh yeah not per year
[10:17:17] <labrador> per month
[10:17:17] <gtlsgamr> 5.9 per month]
[10:17:20] <labrador> ye
[10:17:31] <labrador> So like a video game per year
[10:17:36] <gtlsgamr> i am gonna ditch the vps now.
[10:17:37] <labrador> Not that bad if you think about it
[10:17:50] <gtlsgamr> use some jamstack for the website. or find a shared vps
[10:18:11] <labrador> Or just selfhost?
[10:18:15] <labrador> How hard can it be
[10:18:49] <gtlsgamr> it's not hard
[10:18:56] <gtlsgamr> but then I have to keep the self host on at all times
[10:19:32] <gtlsgamr> and it need electricity at all times
[10:19:32] <gtlsgamr> There was a site that provided free hosting for personal websites if i recall correctly
[10:19:59] <iamak[m]> Try codeberg?
[10:20:05] <iamak[m]> GLI website is hosted there no?
[10:20:35] <labrador> gtlsgamr, how much electricity can a pi take...
[10:20:44] <gtlsgamr> electricity is not an issue! 
[10:20:48] <labrador> Also you can just ditch ipv4 only people
[10:20:49] <gtlsgamr> but there are powercuts here
[10:20:55] <labrador> h
[10:21:14] <gtlsgamr> if codeberg is there then my commenting system would stop working
[10:22:17] <labrador> Its so unfair gtlsgamr,I have a friend,andrew. He's a kid and has a vps.
[10:22:33] <labrador> When I asked him about it,he was like "Whats 5$ to my parents"
[10:23:22] <labrador> (the kid is a genius tho)
[10:24:15] <gtlsgamr> hey kudos to him for getting a vps. And when I got the vps even i was like the same. but now that i think of the accumulated costs
[10:24:29] <gtlsgamr> i could be putting 447 rupees in 
[10:24:33] <gtlsgamr> something else
[10:24:48] <labrador> I dunno man I know a lot that would pay that much for some fun
[10:24:56] <labrador> And a vps can give you tons of fun
[10:25:39] <gtlsgamr> imagine i spend 400 a month into an SIP
[10:25:42] <gtlsgamr> 15% returns
[10:27:22] <labrador> That would be 720/year
[10:28:29] <gtlsgamr> Okay I have an idea! 
[10:28:45] <labrador> I love ideas!
[10:28:53] <gtlsgamr> i will share this vps with one of you
[10:29:02] <gtlsgamr> pay me half the cost 
[10:29:04] <gtlsgamr> ðŸ˜‰ 
[10:29:28] <labrador> *crickets*
[10:30:07] <gtlsgamr> yep
[10:30:12] <gtlsgamr> thats what i thought
[10:30:18] <gtlsgamr> i have paid the bill for this month anyway
[10:30:31] <gtlsgamr> i will use this month to set up an alternative 
[10:30:40] <labrador> gtlsgamr, have you ever thought about making it a seedbox?
[10:30:50] <gtlsgamr> no
[10:31:00] <gtlsgamr> it has 100 gig bandwidth limit
[10:31:10] <gtlsgamr> 25 gb storage
[10:31:25] <labrador> oh
[10:31:27] <gtlsgamr> i need vps right now for znc, my website and joplin.
[10:31:36] <gtlsgamr> For website and joplin I can use my pi.
[10:31:51] <gtlsgamr> need to set up something that will give my website uptime when pi is down

[10:53:40] <AryaK[m]> with ipv4
[10:53:51] <AryaK[m]> only issue is that they require passport verification
[10:54:29] <AryaK[m]> vultr has 2.50 usd plan but its ipv6 only
