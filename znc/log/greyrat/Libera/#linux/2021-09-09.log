It should be included when you do update-grub
[01:47:41] <sysRPL> i have the steam in game fps overlay on showing a solid 60, and i am also using mango hud showing a solid 60, but at least two games are showing that 60 fps but they are plainly not even close to 60fps

[07:22:13] <coldenbrewed> [[R]] yeah sorry for my amateur understanding
[07:22:17] <mlu> this is why railways generally don't take off here: the cities are too far apart to justify the railways
[07:22:24] <kirk781> mlu, does conventional rail existence b/w the two cities?
[07:22:34] <mlu> kirk781: yes, but it's usually used for cargo
[07:22:36] <[[R]]> mlu: we just need to wait 50 years for everyitng to be built up
[07:22:40] <[[R]]> mlu: but then it'll be too laste
[07:22:44] <[[R]]> mlu: catch 33
[07:22:48] <mlu> kirk781: conventional rail runs 40mph (~60kph)
[07:22:58] <kirk781> Ah yes, freight is the lifeline for most railways. Australia and Canada is dependent on it
[07:23:13] <mlu> you're arrive at your destination much faster taking the bus
[07:23:16] <[[R]]> kirk781: australlia and canada have a freight rail between them?
[07:23:32] * mlu wonders what it'd be like to actually build a railway from Canada to Australia
[07:23:52] <coldenbrewed> because rclone is the type of program that outputs info and you need to control-C in order to kill it
[07:23:52] <coldenbrewed> I want to run multiple commands of it at once inside one file
[07:23:52] <coldenbrewed> but if the first line hangs, the second will never be executed
[07:23:52] <coldenbrewed> so in order for things to finish up i need to be able to fork them so the thing is no longer outputting info
[07:23:52] <coldenbrewed> but systemd does not like to manage forked process in type simple and said it failed
[07:23:56] <kirk781> I meant the individual countries' railways

[14:39:49] <alkisg> UnnamedBeer: the main problem here is that gnome3 didn't run on our 10.000+ old computers
[14:39:51] <mags> alkisg: when gnome3 came out is when I realized I could try different DEs and started my whole linux journey
[14:39:53] <alkisg> So we had no choice really
[14:40:05] <lockywolf> I tried KDE several times, and was astonished by the low quality of the code.
[14:40:21] <UnnamedBeer> alkisg: understandable, gnome3 is anything but resource friendly
[14:40:21] <lockywolf> almost as if they only care about eye-candy, and nothing more
[14:40:48] <alkisg> Schools here usually have 5+ years older hardware than what gnome supports. I'm not sure when we'll be able to switch to it, maybe in 10 years if it doesn't bump its requirements :)

IOMMU is supported and detected but there are only 4 groups in total in "/sys/kernel/iommu_groups/". The sole PCIE slot shares an IOMMU group (group '0') with a number of other devices. Are there any suggestions on how my motherboard could be configured to separate the PCIE device into its own IOMMU group?

[16:17:44] <tacokoneko> is currently no possible method for video encoding with this GPU? if so then is there any technical possibility it could come in the future? my vainfo shows many VAEntrypointVLD, but no VAEntrypointEncSlice.

[17:09:44] <hajonnes> BoraxMan, just to be fair, container solutions has its merits, e.g. programs that have a small number of dependencies, programs that are seldome installed and therefore can be distributed to a large group of distributions without much effort. But for me, I would probably try to compile it before I used snap anyway... but I see the merits.
[17:09:45] <djph> Even if we pared it down to Debian and RHEL (just as examples I'm semi-familiar with); there are ... what, a good six versions that're "production supported" most of the time.

[17:19:01] <ananke> if I wanted to compile everything, I'd go back to 1995. and even then it made little sense
[17:19:04] <AliceMeows> Specifically the double click to run aka avoiding compiling your software all the time
[17:19:18] <hajonnes> djph, boraxMan the problem is that it is hard to learn how to compile. I tried to compile and install graphviz for a whole day. Just because I could not find infromation on the errors I got or how to manage a compilation propporly. If the procediour would be well documentated and maintained documentated I think the make command would be as used as the apt command. The problem lies is that distributions maintainer think we want binaries and not
[17:19:19] <hajonnes> documentated compiling procedures.
[17:19:49] <BoraxMan> AliceMeows, we were all newbies once.  I came to Linux because I wanted control, and I liked the idea of being able to use my skills to my advantage.

[17:20:32] <BoraxMan> hajonnes, I do like not having to compiles as much, luckily, there is almost always an RPM

[17:20:58] <oldgalileo> Anyone want to suggest a way to take block devices with a given PARTNAME of like, "PART-A" and create an alias to "PART"? AFAICT udev doesn't really support string manipulation like that

[17:21:45] <djph> AliceMeows: it's not that it's bad per se; but there has to be give-and-take somewhere along the way.  I mean, if I'm spending all my time compiling for you, and all I get back is a wishlist of features and no help ...
[17:21:51] <hajonnes> mlu, but where do I get the information on how to compile. anyway I did not find any information that helped me.
[17:22:01] <ananke> BoraxMan: packages were implied in this context
[17:22:02] <peetaur> oldgalileo: why do you need it? do you know about /dev/disk/by-partlabel/?
[17:22:07] * mlu points to the diagram of squiggly lines
[17:22:31] <BoraxMan> hajonnes, a lot of the time the documentatin on how to compile is just missing.  I actually find it harder now than it was 15 years ago

[17:22:59] <BoraxMan> ananke, oh yes, I misread.  Yes, I prefer compiled binaries
[17:23:09] <djph> BoraxMan: "yeah, you have to just use our custom ruby-compiler to ... " OH GOOD GOD WHAT IS THIS?!
[17:23:17] <hajonnes> BoraxMan, yes for big programs, it saves a lot of time. and I like it also but I would rather compile an obscure program than using a container.
[17:23:23] <djph> oops, caps stuck there :)
[17:23:43] <AliceMeows> djph: providing source alone might not always get people to help you, if anything you should simply ask them to pay you if they wish to have new features added quicker
[17:23:53] <oldgalileo> peetaur: Yeah, I need to substitute that name with a subset to strip off the "A"
[17:23:54] <mlu> it's actually interesting: I've talked to certain unskilled people straight out of bootcamp that actually can't imagine compiling from source from a tarball instead of fetching from a repo

[17:25:32] <mlu> I wonder if the developer knew what to do themselves ;)
[17:25:55] <djph> AliceMeows: The underlying point being that somewhere in the middle is where we should strive to be.  I full well understand that not everyone can (or necessarily wants to) compile.  I mean, that's why we have APT and RPM and so, isn't it :)

[17:27:53] <BoraxMan> djph, I agree.  I've written some small programs, but I provide a tarball that will compile with ./configure; make; make install.  I write with the user in mind.  I expect someone to actually want to use my program
[17:28:07] <oldgalileo> But I'm thinking maybe it might be easiest to use UDEV to match on `ENV{ID_FS_PARTLABEL}=*-[AB]` and then pass that to `RUN` which handles the actual string substitution

[17:30:03] <oldgalileo> Oh, I guess the other alternative would be to customize the matching itself. Is there a way to export an environment variable into udev from a script?

[17:38:25] <peetaur> why don't they just do it properly? have dependencies specify the versions, and then multiple versions are installed; and then the fancy fuse fs stuff can just combine the versions of things into one container (no containers even necessary...you could probably hack something with LD_LIBRARY_PATH), but not literally have copies of them like some braindead or lazy designer

[18:06:32] <Psi-Jack> The CD-key is technically available in proc somewhere.. Sec
[18:06:40] <peetaur> k...well the free upgrade thing is different; it exists in a quasi-legal state where it's a license, but they somehow managed to enforce it illegally where if you change the hardware, they aren't forced to let you

[18:55:12] <Henry151> i compare the "feel" of debian to the feel of driving a 2002 Subaru Legacy Outback Wagon... where even say, Ubuntu, feels like a 2016 Kia.
[18:55:14] <peetaur> everything is nice about debian except systemd and their random inconsistent release cycle; if they planned it like ubuntu then you wouldn't need as many backports
[18:55:18] <asgas> Debian is pretty awesome, but the fact it takes a while for newer packages to go from testing to stable is why I don't really use it.
[18:55:47] <peetaur> if ubutu got debian to match their release cycle, ubuntu LTS would start stable instead of needing 3-6 months to be usable in production, and debian would be better too
[18:56:04] <Henry151> I like the release cycle.. funny enough, for example, I use firefox-esr as my browser, even though that's even older than standard firefox package on debian

[18:56:42] <peetaur> I don't care about how long it takes...but I hate when something broken ends up in the "stable" and they won't update it even if the testing one works better, and then you have to backport, and enough of that makes a mess

[20:44:38] <sublim20> anybody have experience with lutris or playonlinux, and which to use
[20:44:40] <pikapika> I was wondering if a low cost chromebook would work as that
[20:45:00] <pikapika> like you'd need to open a browser and do something etc while outside

[20:45:14] <superkuh> playonlinux is good enough for me. It makes setting up custom wine env much easier. UI is a bit "open source" but it does the job.
[20:45:25] <paulcarroty> playonlinux gone 5y+ ago
[20:45:40] * superkuh lives in the past.
[20:45:45] <paulcarroty> for $150 you can get a used laptop

[20:45:55] <sublim20> so what advantages, if any, does lutris have
[20:46:17] <sublim20> they both seem to be guis for wine / winetricks
[20:46:19] <pikapika> paulcarroty, I'll add about 60-70 dollars to that
[20:46:27] <rustytaco> pikapika: For outdoors a semi-ruggedized tablet runs about the same cost as a chromebook

[21:33:23] <ArticulateHacker> SSHD by default supports ssh-rsa, rsa-sha2-256, and rsa-sha2-512 (among others) for host key signature algorithms. I want to remove support for ssh-rsa because it uses SHA1. When I remove ssh-rsa from the HostKeyAlgorithms line in sshd_config it also removes rsa-sha2-256 and rsa-sha2-512. Is there any way to remove only ssh-rsa?
