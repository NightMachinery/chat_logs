[16:19:52] <omegatron> in bash/shell, you just need to know that the environment variables are a key-value dictionary you can access ... no pointers to some raw data involved
[16:20:18] <omegatron> you would have to tell us more about what you are trying to do .. but as already said, if two or more processes need to exchange information, use files (or maybe sockets) for this, if it's supposed to be a pure bash-solution ..   check in an infinite loop for the existence of a certain file and read it, when conditions are met
[16:20:45] <earnestly> pipes!
[16:20:48] <omegatron> and if more than one process might modify the file, use a lock file ..
[16:20:53] <emanuele6> in this case is not even multiple processes that exchange information
[16:21:16] <emanuele6> i think he just wants to keep a counter of how many times the script has been run

[18:55:52] <gentwo> omegatron: is this something i have to apply as a option with sed?
[18:57:15] <omegatron> i'm no expert with sed - it could be that sed is utf-8 bom aware by default or with some parameter and would preserve it .. but that's just a guess .. and your sed might be different from mine, depending on version etc. ...
[18:58:12] <gentwo> it's an ubuntu VM, prior to apply the scrip i did test on gentoo linux and it was working as expected though
[19:00:28] <emanuele6> [-_-]: oh, i figured out what is the difference between $if mode=vi \n set keymap ... \n ... \n $fi and set keymap ... \n ...

[19:01:48] <emanuele6> so exactly like: bind -m vi-insert '"\C-b": ...'
[19:02:14] <omegatron> gentwo: I would just run a few tests, to check if your sed is BOM-aware or not (by whatever means) .. if it's not, then you might have to change your sed command to include the BOM
[19:02:14] <emanuele6> if you wrap it in an $if mode=vi, that binding will only be added to the map if readline starts up in vi mode
[19:03:14] <emanuele6> for example, if your inputrc is http://paste.wooledge.org/9436 and you run `bash --norc', you will see that if you then use `set -o vi', you won't get the \C-b binding
[19:03:43] <emanuele6> but if you add a `set editing-mode vi' at the top of the file, you will get the binding
[19:04:40] <emanuele6> so, you don't actually want the $if mode=vi, you just want set keymap vi-insert and then a bunch of binding definitions

[22:58:40] <Nintendo> I have a C program that checks for data on stdin at startup using poll() and POLLIN, timing out immediately.  If I pipe a local file, the C program sees the data.  If there is a delay, however, as in "wget -O - | prog", no data ever reaches prog because of the timeout.
[22:58:47] *** Joins: mihaiadrian (~Thunderbi@82.76.223.244)

[23:06:43] <earnestly> Nintendo: In such cases the convention is to use an argument like - to indicate that stdin is expected
[23:07:09] <earnestly> Generally checking if you're connected to a tty is also a better proxy than checking for data on a timeout

[23:08:06] <earnestly> It's all well and good having a kind of backoff algo, but blocking IO means it could be a very long time and still legitimate
[23:08:09] <Nintendo> The program is allowed to assume tty.
