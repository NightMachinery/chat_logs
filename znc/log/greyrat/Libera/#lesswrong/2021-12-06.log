[00:34:43] <gwern> Gurkenglas: just storing a Map throws away the metadata. what happens when OA changes what 'davinci-similarity' goes to? and you might want to compare embeddings for accuracy later on, or concatenate or average them, or compute ranking separately and then average the ranking?
[00:34:57] <gwern> if you leave the model implicit, you are asking for subtle later bugs
[00:35:13] <gwern> what if they simply do further training/finetuning so the embeddings are *mostly* similar?
[00:36:10] <Gurkenglas> does modelID help this? presumably if you get a different id for the updated model you can also tell them the old id to get the old mode
[00:47:27] <gwern> I'm not sure if you can query arbitrary old models
[00:49:44] <gwern> https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/engines https://beta.openai.com/docs/engines when I list engines, I don't get any versions, just the model names. "ada", not "ada-v1.235"
[00:49:45] <Robomot> OpenAI API (An API for accessing new AI models developed by OpenAI)
[00:49:45] <Robomot> OpenAI API (An API for accessing new AI models developed by OpenAI)
[00:50:11] <Gurkenglas> and therefore all you'll have in the modelID is "ada", right?
[00:50:49] <gwern> no, as you can see, it does return the more informative "babbage-similarity-model:2021-09-20"
[00:51:34] <gwern> so I assume what happens is that 'babbage' is a moving target. when you query an engine, you can only ask for 'babbage', whatever that is at that instant. but it'll tell you what version that happens to be, so you know when it stops being that version
[00:52:08] <gwern> but once it updates t "babbage-similarity-model:2021-12-20", then now all your embeddings are frozen in amber, because you can no longer get any new babbage-similarity-model
[00:52:16] <gwern> * babbage-similarity-model:2021-09-20
[00:56:13] <gwern> this is a basic problem with all embeddings... their lifecycle. they're blackboxes, which can't really be 'upgraded'
[01:08:27] <Gurkenglas> fair enough :)

[01:22:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's really no question at all how the balance comes out
[01:22:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> It was just massively, massively net-positive
[01:22:40] <saturn2> you never would have made the friends you had in a typical high school
[01:22:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Correct
[01:22:55] <gwern> maybe for you. personally, I could've skipped it. maybe it was a private school, but it was not stuy, and the sleep deprivation and have I mentioned the multi-hour commutes? alone made it a waste
[01:22:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which is why it's important to have more schools like mine
[01:23:20] <gwern> more like, why it's important to have more kids of the sort that make schools like yours
[01:23:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> No! There are already lots of kids like that and not enough schools to support them!
[01:23:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not in NYC, of course
[01:23:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> But elsewhere
[01:24:24] <gwern> there aren't 'lots of kids' in the sense of adequate density, unless I am laboring under very severe misapprehensions about NYC magnet school cutoffs and population norms
[01:25:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of course not in *density*, that is indeed the problem
[01:25:17] <Gurkenglas> i don't remember a lot. but school was worse than no school. other kids was worse than not other kids.
[01:26:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> There is no other place in the U.S. that can support as many "top schools" as NYC, for the very basic and obvious reason that there's no other place in the U.S. with as many people in one place as NYC
[01:26:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> It does not follow from this that America outside New York City is a lifeless wasteland with zero people living in it
[01:26:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> ("view from 9th ave" etc. notwithstanding)
[01:27:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Statistically, we should expect *most* smart kids in the U.S. to be living outside NYC, because NYC is like, what, 2% of the total national population?
[01:27:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> 2-3%?
[01:30:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> So yes, there absolutely are "lots of kids", they're just not clustered enough to justify Stuy/BxSci/BkTech type schools for them (not that there's any guarantee that such would spring up if they were clustered - these schools are very old, would such new ones be opened today? maybe not - but let's set that aside for now)
[01:36:45] <gwern> exactly. there's not enough schools to support them, because there's not enough density to cover the cost of such specialization. like anything else. it's not 'important to have more schools like yours' because it can't be done. the costs are what they are and are set by density. the density is the only part that could be fixed
[01:37:07] <gwern> and density is easiest to fix by having higher-quality kids
[01:37:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't follow the last part
[01:38:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Anyway, I think the answer that makes sense (whether or not we endorse it) is "there is no difference; indeed there is no good reason one should have 'freedom' to teach your kids bullshit instead of science, or to prevent them from learning how to multiply until they're 16, etc."
[01:38:45] <Gurkenglas> faster transit sounds a possible enough fix
[01:38:52] <gwern> I don't think the multiplication stuff matters much. as the KA guy says, he learned it all when he wanted/needed it
[01:39:14] <gwern> and recall scott's graduation speech. most teaching is just plain wasted. you can delay school by years with zero visible effect. the finns do it
[01:39:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Right? I mean, like, when we say "there's a lack of police accountability" or something, aren't we also saying "the police shouldn't have the freedom to beat people up who look at 'em funny, and steal people's wallets at will"? Well, yeah, that's exactly what we're saying
[01:40:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Of course it matters
[01:40:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> "he learned it all when he wanted/needed it" is a tendentious reading of the post -_-
[01:40:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> You think that guy will ever be able to be mentally fluent in math, in mathematical abstractions, etc.?
[01:40:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not a chance
[01:41:08] <gwern> yes, just like finns perform fine despite delaying teaching math by years. or other unschooling examples

[01:54:34] <gwern> I think a lot of US problems stem from severe overestimation of the value of education, the efficiency of education as implemented, its causal effects, and severe underestimation of the quality of life costs, the opportunity costs, etc. and this is how we get madness like people demanding everyone workin in pre-k daycare having a Masters in Education
[01:55:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Like, I started school when I was a few months shy of 7. I would never describe that as "delayed". Nobody taught me any formal math before then (I went to kindergarten but we didn't really "learn" there). So the idea that we're arguing about whether to start algebra at 5 or to delay it until *7*, and that *these* are the two opposing "sides" to the argument, is pretty wacky, and really bears no relationship to either
[01:55:00] <Obormot\Arcturus>  anything I'm saying or anything that the people in that subreddit are complaining about
[01:55:18] <catern> well, education is not about learning

[01:58:23] <saturn2> "if i can't have it, no one can" is a pretty common attitude

[02:00:00] <gwern> will the children who go to the magnet school talk about how it changed their life because they met stephen sondheim tapdancing on the steps one day? sure. but that's meaningless because you don't know that they wouldn't've become a breakdancing sensation on tiktok in their free time in the alternative history you'll never see.

[04:32:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Without giving spoilers: basically, in the show the main guys have this tech that does like a Standard Sci-Fi Trope Thing™ (not gonna say which, doesn't matter really). And as soon as it's really revealed what it is, the viewer naturally has various *burning questions*. Shortly after the gradual reveal finally gives the viewer enough info to ask the central question, there's a dialogue between two of the characters, where
[04:32:27] <Obormot\Arcturus>  one of them does in fact exact that exact question! Yes! Excellent!
[04:32:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... and then the other character gives a completely bullshit non-answer, the first guy nods, and that's that.
[04:33:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Furthermore, and what makes it *much worse* ...
[04:34:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> The question is of the form "but what if we did <very easy to do test>, what would happen???" (The implication being: "the results of doing this simple test would have massive implications about all sorts of stuff!")
[04:35:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> And then not only do they proceed *not to do this simple test*, but the obvious implication of the scene is that - given that they're stipulated to have had this fancy new tech for a while now - they've never tried doing it previously either!
[04:35:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> But it's obviously, like, the *first* thing you'd try with it!
[04:35:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> But nope
[04:35:59] <nshepperd> lol classic
[04:38:48] <gwern> 'no one tried because we are all very incurious here. The curious people keep dying their first week.' 'Isn't that odd?' 'I guess.'
[04:38:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's sort of like... imagine if there was a show where someone invented a device that could turn an object into energy and then that energy back into that object (i.e., the Star Trek teleporter)...
[04:39:47] <gwern> 'Everyone who asks that question also dies their first week. It was nice knowing you.'
[04:39:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> And then mid-show someone was like "I'm absolutely consumed by the question of whether this device could be used to turn arbitrary energy into arbitrary matter, like, do we also have a *replicator* on our hands???"
[04:40:29] <mjr> surely not, that would be silly
[04:40:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> "What would happen if we tried to turn some energy into a different object? Like we have a pattern saved from a potato, can we energy a tomato and use the potato pattern to reconstitute it??! We could try that *right now*!!"

[04:40:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> And then someone else was like "Making matter out of nothing is impossible."
[04:41:10] <mjr> It depends which week it is and what the plot requires transporters to function like.
[04:41:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> And that was the end of the conversation.
[04:41:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Devs is not about teleportation but it's at least the same level of wtf. *At least*.)
[04:41:47] <nshepperd> don't be silly, this device has "transporter" written right on it, it's not a replicator
[04:42:43] <gwern> if you were supposed to use it to replicate, it would be clearly written on it.
[04:42:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> (It's actually even worse because in the actual case it's not even an "alternative use" or "creative repurposing" thing, it's actually just *the obvious question* about the central conceit, I just couldn't think of an example that was *quite* as bad as the one in the actual show -_- )
[04:43:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't even understand why they'd bother bringing it up!
[04:43:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe the show will redeem itself with some reveal later, but, damn, it'd have to be something *really* redeeming
[04:43:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> No, I got it, here's a better example:
[04:45:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's like if you had a show about teleporting potatoes, and then someone asked "Can we use it to teleport living things? Can we try it with like an earthworm right now?? What would happen? Would it die or not?", and the response was "Teleportation is impossible".
[04:45:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, LITERALLY TRY IT, WHY WOULD YOU NOT TRY IT IMMEDIATELY, THE VERY FIRST TIME YOU GOT THE FUCKING THING WORKING AEKHJdkjhgdsfkhgjfdg
[04:46:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> "We have an earthworm right here! I could put it in the teleport *right now* and press this button here. I could literally do it while we're talking. Should I do it?" "No."
[04:46:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> *they never discuss it again*
[04:46:57] <gwern> 'teleportation of living things is impossible and has never been done before.' 'oh. never mind then.'

[11:10:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Real Men™ blog via PmWiki ;)
[11:13:16] <adiabatic> real men just upload hand-written HTML files to a server and they don't even use prettier
[11:13:46] <PapuaHardyNet> I already knew that catern was the only real man here
[11:14:20] <nshepperd2> real men don't have time to blog bc they're too busy dying in armed combat
[11:14:22] <adiabatic> no wait, real men just update their .plan file and tell you to finger them
[11:14:37] <PapuaHardyNet> okay
[11:15:15] <PapuaHardyNet> catern is basically a younger, more technically-obsessed gwern: https://catern.com/
[11:15:16] <Robomot> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[11:15:23] <adiabatic> no wait, real men invent a new programming language and then write a high-performance finger daemon in it
[11:15:51] <adiabatic> gwern: where's your chicken chili recipe
[11:17:23] <adiabatic> catern: making use of the optionality of attribute value quotes? you rebel, you
[11:26:00] <feep[work]> hmhm. ranges.
[11:26:07] <feep[work]> I wanna be able to be like
[11:26:16] <feep[work]> int i; return sum [a + i for a in arg];
[11:26:19] <feep[work]> er, [sum *
[11:26:41] <feep[work]> right now this works because "a + i" is just a code fragment evaluated in the context of a macro expanded for loop.
[11:27:09] <feep[work]> but I want this to work too: [sum [a + i for a in arg]], and I want it to work by [a + i for ...] being a *value*
[11:27:44] <feep[work]> so I *think* the only way to get this, *without* lambdas or callbacks or captures, is to have a new type for a "code fragment" that must be evaluated in the context of the calling function
[11:28:07] <feep[work]> but then you run into the awkward issue that sum can no longer be a library function, because a + i cannot be evaluated in a subfunction
[11:28:23] <feep[work]> tho it still works by making sum always a macro
[11:28:30] <feep[work]> so I'm not sure if this is even an issue
[11:28:37] <feep[work]> ofc you can't return ranges then, which limits composability
[11:30:06] <feep[work]> and it kind of torpedoes my range approach in general, because you can't stick [a + i for a in arg] in a nested user defined range type anymore
[11:30:27] <feep[work]> so it seems like a hack that just doesn't buy enough to be worthwhile
[11:31:04] <feep[work]> and maybe I should just go ahead and implement lambda by-value capture anyways
[11:31:27] <adiabatic> seems like you've made up your mind already, but why are you avoiding lambdas/closures
[11:31:29] <PapuaHardyNet> sounds good!
[11:32:41] <feep[work]> adiabatic: they're hard ;.;
[11:32:48] <adiabatic> good reason!
[11:33:38] <feep[work]> and also it's a sort of thing where like
[11:33:47] <feep[work]> you write code that you're hoping the optimizer will later inline
[11:33:54] <feep[work]> instead of just generating inline code
[11:34:17] *** Quits: _inky (~inky_@141.136.79.85) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[11:34:45] <feep[work]> but I think that ship sailed when I specced my range api to be based on function calls
[11:35:04] <feep[work]> and composability just is really important.
[11:35:28] <feep[work]> so maybe I should just bite the bullet and make proper lambdas my big christmas project
[11:36:59] <feep[work]> mm.
[11:38:15] <feep[work]> I mean, it wouldn't even be super hard
[11:38:36] <adiabatic> dumb question: are closures way harder than mere lambdas
[11:38:42] <adiabatic> to implement
[11:38:44] <feep[work]> those are basically the same thing
[11:38:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Aren't closures and lam... yeah
[11:38:52] <feep[work]> well, lambdas are the same thing as nested functions
[11:38:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> errr
[11:39:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is that true
[11:39:03] <feep[work]> and closures are a relation between nested functions and the surrounding functions
[11:39:12] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: it is in Dlikes
[11:39:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... that basically tells me nothing, lol
[11:39:27] <feep[work]> well, still sorta: lambdas are templated nested functions.
[11:39:30] <adiabatic> well, I can imagine a language that has lambdas but won't let you write back or even read variables outside the lambda's arguments
[11:39:34] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: "yes, but ralith would disagree"
[11:39:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Heh.
[11:39:54] <adiabatic> yeah, but who is he to disagree? I know him mostly as the domestic fudge guy
[11:39:58] <feep[work]> XD
[11:40:17] <feep[work]> of us, I'm sort of the hacky C-y person, and he's the like, formal haskellite

[11:40:33] <adiabatic> Ah.
[11:40:57] <adiabatic> Cish would make a decent name of a programming language…
[11:41:06] <feep[work]> actually, since he doesn't seem to be immediately here, let me emulate
[11:41:12] <feep[work]> <Ralith> feep are you making up meanings of words again
[11:41:37] <saturn2> i agree with pseudoralith
[11:41:47] <feep[work]> saturn2: that is seriously how it works in D
[11:41:54] <feep[work]> lambdas are literally templated nested functions
[11:42:11] <saturn2> that's absurd!
[11:42:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Someone should make a language called C--
[11:42:26] <feep[work]> I mean, what's the difference in other languages?
[11:42:55] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: IIRC someone already did
[11:43:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wow yeah

[11:43:08] <Robomot> C-- - Wikipedia (C-- (pronounced C minus minus) is a C-like programming language. Its creators, functional programming researchers Simon Peyton Jones and Norman Ramsey, designed it to be generated mainly by compilers for very high-level languages rather than written by human programmers. Unlike many other intermediate languages, its representation is plain ASCII text, not bytecode or another binary format.[1][2])

[11:43:52] <feep[work]> yeah gstreamer is known for this stuff
[11:44:20] <feep[work]> generally you install it because you don't care about security, you just wanna play that one esoteric sound file from a game from 1995
[11:44:49] <feep[work]> note how the nsf plugin is in a package called gstreamer-plugins-bad
[11:44:54] <adiabatic> reminds me of the Quake Rally music

[11:45:12] <feep[work]> true
[11:45:21] <PapuaHardyNet> time to use openbsd only
[11:45:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ironically, Firefox crashed when I opened that link
[11:46:16] <adiabatic> openbsd is an OS for people who think they can write secure software in C
[11:46:21] <feep[work]> saturn2: ping~?
[11:47:38] <feep[work]> lol, I have a split terminal, and in one window the font size is different than the other
[11:47:44] <feep[work]> this looks so wrong
[11:48:15] <adiabatic> o.O
[11:48:28] <saturn2> "Peter J. Landin defined the term closure in 1964 as having an environment part and a control part as used by his SECD machine for evaluating expressions.[3] Joel Moses credits Landin with introducing the term closure to refer to a lambda expression whose open bindings (free variables) have been closed by (or bound in) the lexical environment, resulting in a closed expression, or closure"
[11:49:14] <saturn2> a closure is just a lambda expression that has free variables
[11:49:17] <PapuaHardyNet> adiabatic: sure, but I have no idea of anything more secure than openbsd. Also, to be fair, C is a language I understand. I would never try a Rust-first OS
[11:49:31] <feep[work]> saturn2: yes, but what differentiates that from a nested function
[11:49:39] <adiabatic> PapuaHardyNet: You wouldn't? Not even try?
[11:50:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> I wouldn't try a Rust-first OS because I am ideologically opposed to COMMUNISM
[11:50:12] <feep[work]> saturn2: like, I know the closure thing :p
[11:50:31] <feep[work]> nested functions also act as closures in D.
[11:50:54] <feep[work]> ie. int delegate() foo(int i) { int bar() { return i; } return &bar; }
[11:50:55] <saturn2> i don't believe nested functions exist
[11:51:05] <feep[work]> .. that seems a hot take
[11:51:10] <saturn2> functions are just functions
[11:51:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> But what if you nest them
[11:51:22] <feep[work]> ^
[11:51:25] <feep[work]> this but unironically
[11:51:51] <nshepperd2> a nested function is just a lambda with a filthy syntax
[11:52:00] <feep[work]> filth! FILTH
[11:52:08] <feep[work]> C-ite heresy!
[11:52:17] <adiabatic> my hunch is that saturn2 thinks of nested functions as so little a deal as to not deserve a special name
[11:52:20] <saturn2> yes, it's just a syntactic trick
[11:52:26] <feep[work]> sure, but syntax matters
[11:52:34] <feep[work]> I mean it sounds like you're actually 
[11:52:36] <adiabatic> even though it's kind of a big deal in, say, C
[11:52:39] <feep[work]> I mean it sounds like you're actually agreeing with my take*?
[11:52:48] <saturn2> maybe
[11:52:52] <feep[work]> ie. lambdas are templated nested functions cause D got nested functions first
[11:53:00] <feep[work]> but D nested functions were always what lisp called lambdas
[11:53:04] <feep[work]> er
[11:53:08] <feep[work]> yeah
[11:53:40] <feep[work]> though they weren't true closures until D2
[11:53:51] <feep[work]> and I probably won't make them true closures either, because escape analysis is hard
[11:54:20] <saturn2> that's terrible
[11:54:31] <feep[work]> sadly, this is the world we are forced to inhabit
[11:54:40] <feep[work]> I'd rather have something adequate than not have something superior
[11:55:02] <feep[work]> and at this point I need to look at what's easy to implement
[11:55:14] <saturn2> you're actively choosing not to use something superior
[11:55:28] <feep[work]> damn you're a good ralith
[11:55:38] <feep[work]> I'm actively choosing not to try and fail to implement something superior
[11:55:38] <saturn2> :)
[11:56:44] <feep[work]> at this point, in this project, I have experience with what I'll run into and bounce off
[11:56:53] <feep[work]> escape analysis is at least one refactor away from feasibility

Thus, the company has adopted Huawei's working practices. This means long working hours, considerable political intervention, tough annual assessments for bonuses, and a Jack Welch-style bottom 5-10% layoff each year. This is based on comments from Chinese message boards and job sites."
[16:13:19] <synthmeat> one thing to note, i had 2 accounts reported to be hacked with gravatar thing - but one of those didn't even authorize Gravatar, it was only wordpress account.

In August 2016, they forced password resets for customers they believed may be at risk. A large volume of data totalling over 68 million records was subsequently traded online and included email addresses and salted hashes of passwords (half of them SHA1, half of them bcrypt)."
[16:18:56] <two2thehead> Okay, so the only thing I may be vulnerable to is gravatar. synthmeat +1

[17:49:50] <feep> yeah what's that in flops?
[17:51:15] <feep> that's 5gflops ish, maybe with avx512 or sth you could do it on cpu, almost definitely with multithreading?
[17:51:22] <kuudes> 2^20 floats per matrix, worst case one new matrix per op, matmul is ~^3 so ((2^20)^3)^12 ?
[17:51:50] <feep> matmul is not ^3
[17:52:12] <kuudes> isn't it? I thought ot is O(n^3) or less
[17:52:40] <feep> ah google says you can beat ^3 but not easily
[17:52:49] <kuudes> yes, but never O(n^2)
[17:53:06] <feep> sure, it's ^3 ish
[17:53:53] <kuudes> so is it 2^360? how do exponents to multiplication go again?
[17:53:54] <feep> fair enough
[17:54:11] <feep> yeah the ^3 makes multiply hard-unfeasible on cpu
[17:54:37] <feep> even like addition was already at the limit.
[17:55:22] <feep> actually
[17:55:31] <feep> unfeasible so hard it kills even gpus

[17:57:00] <feep> wiki says strassen gets you down to 2.4something, blas should have that

[17:58:56] <kuudes> 20*2.4*12?

[17:59:58] <PapuaHardyNet> nshepperd2: interesting. I never thought of distillation
[18:00:11] <kuudes> I would think the window for "can be run on gpu but not on cpu" is rather small
[18:00:22] <kuudes> the area "is feasible at all" is way larger
[18:01:10] <feep> yeah
[18:05:29] <kuudes> hmm...
[18:05:39] <kuudes> I think there is an error in thinking there
[18:06:04] <kuudes> isn't it rather 12*((2^20)^2.4)
[18:06:17] <kuudes> because they are just sequential ops?
[18:06:50] <kuudes> 12* 2^48 ~ 2^52
[18:07:17] <kuudes> giga is 2^30, so that is just 2^22 gigaflops?

[18:21:36] <feep> 2e4 is 20000

[18:21:42] <kuudes> 20000*20000

[18:21:59] <Khoth> which you then *don't cube*

[18:22:48] <feep> ^2 already lets you combine every element with every element
[18:22:58] <feep> it would be hard to see how matmul could be *worse* than that.

Its computational complexity is therefore / O / ( / n / 3 / ) / {\ …)
[18:23:27] <kuudes> yeah
[18:23:40] <Khoth> if you don't do anything clever, there are n^2 cells in the result and each cell is the result of n muliplications and n-1 additions
[18:23:59] <feep> oyeah
[18:24:02] <feep> you're right
[18:24:17] <feep> hang on.
[18:24:41] <feep> wait. yeah. n^3. makes perfect sense.
[18:24:52] <kuudes> ok, so then 2e4^3 = 2e12
[18:25:00] <kuudes> 8e12
[18:25:13] <Khoth> and double that
[18:25:24] <kuudes> 1e3 = 2^10
[18:25:27] <kuudes> fermi
[18:25:49] <kuudes> double which way?
[18:25:49] <feep> tho you're probably not hitting ^3 still
[18:26:23] <feep> numpy is p optimized
[18:26:26] <kuudes> 2^3*2^40? 2^43
[18:26:31] <Khoth> double because asymptotic computational complexity isn't the same as number of operations, and the n^3 algorith takes 2*n^3 operations
[18:26:44] <kuudes> well that is just +1 on the exponent
[18:26:52] <kuudes> 2^44
[18:27:05] <kuudes> 2^14 gflops?
[18:27:17] <feep> I think numpy has at least strassen
[18:28:02] <kuudes> 20000 ~2^10*2^4 = 2^14
[18:28:56] <kuudes> 12*((2^14)^2.4)
[18:29:14] <Khoth> I don't think there's anything known that's better than strassen in real life
[18:29:58] <kuudes> 12*2^32 ~2^36 flops
[18:30:13] <kuudes> so 2^6 gflops
[18:30:30] <feep> yeah okay that's still well beyond cpus
[18:30:44] <kuudes> computer has 2^7 gflops, so it is 2^-1 computers
[18:31:08] <kuudes> it is possibly doable
[18:31:13] <kuudes> at least with gpu indeed

[18:32:27] <feep> synthmeat: that could work actually.
[18:33:36] <feep> kuudes: tho I don't think you can actually hit 2^4, I'm having a hard time finding out what the actual complexity is that you can feasibly hit at that scale
[18:33:37] <synthmeat> would it help that it's diagonally (just one though) symmetric?
[18:33:45] <feep> synthmeat: look
[18:33:49] <feep> synthmeat: go bench.
[18:33:54] <Khoth> anyway really instead of random theoretical bolahblah it's better to just try blas and see how long it takes

[19:02:32] <feep> and even if I could, I could not get an appointment in time to be relevant
[19:02:37] <kuudes> and part of health officials seem to be infecting us on purpose
[19:02:51] <kuudes> ggreer, good! thank you
[19:03:03] <feep> and *even then* I wouldn't, because the only relevant thing for me rn is not infecting my parents over christmas
[19:03:07] <kuudes> she hasn't got even 1st dose?
[19:03:14] <kuudes> yes
[19:03:19] <feep> and I am well ready to accept a higher probability of infection in january for that
[19:03:35] <ggreer> kuudes: correct. she's 20 so it's not like covid is actually risky. me with a booster has a higher chance of issues than her unvaccinated
[19:03:37] <kuudes> but omicron makes the current info unstable; we may be in threat of life already
[19:04:10] <feep> hence 10 days of at-home quarantine followed by repeated self-tests
[19:04:11] <kuudes> ie in worst case age 38 will be equal to current age 75
[19:04:20] <ggreer> anyway her mom thinks that mrna vaccines change your DNA or whatever. it's totally psychotic
[19:04:37] <kuudes> yes
[19:04:50] <kuudes> thanks for caring for the sister ggreer
[19:05:04] <ggreer> I mean I'd be a pretty terrible person if I didn't help
[19:05:19] <kuudes> well sure, but that does not mean it is not good that you care ^_^
[19:05:43] <kuudes> I get my 4th dose tomorrow
[19:06:12] <Gurkenglas> i got an appointment on doctolib yesterday for friday
[19:06:17] <ggreer> why 4th? it's not like they're infinity stones
[19:06:42] <kuudes> for autoimmune patients such as me there was additional dose on 8 weeks from 2nd and booster on normal time
[19:06:44] <kuudes> this is my booster
[19:06:46] <ggreer> oh
[19:07:13] <Gurkenglas> kuudes, what data do you have on how much the booster helps against omicron?
[19:07:42] <kuudes> Gurkenglas, in south africa first guess is that vaccinated people have 1/3 chance compared to unvaccinated to get into hospital
[19:07:48] <kuudes> but data is still low
[19:08:11] <kuudes> hospitalizations normalized by vaccination rates
[19:08:21] <Gurkenglas> so delta has 60% infection, omicron has 60% hospital, i see a pattern
[19:08:50] <Gurkenglas> (*protection against)
[19:08:50] <feep> corona omega: 60% chance of survival
[19:09:03] <kuudes> more is better, and as long as you don't puke on booster, it seems a good tradeoff
[19:09:32] <kuudes> omicron specific doses come out maybe in march, maybe in july
[19:10:36] <kuudes> so meanwhile boosters are the best we have, and it seems they still have a reasonable chance to deter hospitalization and death
[19:10:56] <kuudes> given R has lowered, I am more hopeful it is not that lethal though
[19:11:19] <two2thehead> hm
[19:11:24] <two2thehead> four months. Not bad
[19:11:34] <two2thehead> Well, five if you want to round up
[19:11:46] <kuudes> a narrative that has been put forward is that earlier kids immunity against serious illness would have been connected to mpr vaccine or something, and omicron would have enough mutations that it bypasses that
[19:12:11] <kuudes> two2thehead, most of the time is bureacracy and safety, so if people start dying in droves, I guess sooner
[19:12:26] <two2thehead> Hm :-/
[19:13:10] <kuudes> Gurkenglas, personally I model it so that we are playing the game on virus particle count exponent
[19:13:40] <Gurkenglas> i gave up on that model when it didnt pay rent
[19:13:42] <kuudes> and vaccines give us subtranct to the exponent, virus mutations give positives
[19:13:45] <kuudes> oh?
[19:16:07] <Gurkenglas> if the virus particle count were on a log scale i would expect higher probability of death from the immune system reacting O(1) too late

[21:46:46] <PapuaHardyNet> you are sending params to the loss function. that doesn't make any sense, you are supposed to send the output of a network to a loss function

[21:48:12] <PapuaHardyNet> okay, while you are actually returning loss from that function, it doesn't change the fact that you have made it artficially elegant to do a gradient descent by passing the params to the loss function
[21:48:29] <PapuaHardyNet> in practical circumstances you never pass params to the loss function
[21:52:06] <PapuaHardyNet> you know what, this is my fault, you are right
[21:52:34] <PapuaHardyNet> you cannot really use the grad to update the params without actually calculating it over the params

[22:30:34] <RiversHaveWings> PapuaHardyNet: "you are sending params to the loss function" the gradient is the vector of partial derivatives of a function, if you want the gradient wrt the params the params have to be an input
[22:31:40] <RiversHaveWings> like technically the input to the function is an n-dimensional vector where n is the number of parameters.
[22:32:01] <RiversHaveWings> jax lets you represent it as a pytree for convenience
[22:32:17] <RiversHaveWings> and gives you the gradient in the same format
[22:34:29] <RiversHaveWings> but jax like... requires the function to differentiate to be an actual python function
[22:34:55] <RiversHaveWings> whereas in frameworks like pytorch you can define the function to differentiate implicitly by doing computations
[22:36:00] <RiversHaveWings> and the function to differentiate is "whatever you did involving these tensors that required grad (were marked as inputs) and thus caused computations involving them to be tracked"
[22:37:14] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, using pytorch meant my mental models for gradient calculation was skewed
[22:37:40] <PapuaHardyNet> and yes, I got it - the grad is the same shape as the input to the function whose gradient is being calculated
[22:37:47] <RiversHaveWings> *nods*
[22:38:03] <PapuaHardyNet> which is why the loss function needs to have params as its first input since we are calculating grad with respect to it
[22:38:19] <PapuaHardyNet> thanks!
[22:38:34] <RiversHaveWings> the pytorch way of doing it is more flexible imo
[22:39:00] <RiversHaveWings> jax likes to have an actual Python function to differentiate bc it is going to trace and compile and optimize it
[22:40:24] <RiversHaveWings> that + it fits with its functional programming model

[22:51:11] <feepbot> <gwern> 'I once worked as a consultant for a company where there was only one old-timer around. He spent most of his time in meetings, because he knew all the intricate details of how everything worked and talked together, and other people needed to know. After I'd been involved with that (otherwise wonderful) company on and off for a few years, I accumulated some knowledge as
[22:51:11] <feepbot> well, and people wanted to have meetings with me. In the beginning, I obliged. Then it turned out that a week after I'd had a meeting, I'd be called to what would essentially be the same meeting again. Why? Because some other stakeholder heard about the first meeting and decided that he or she also required that information. The solution? Call another meeting. My counter-move was
[22:51:11] <feepbot> to begin to write things down. When people would call a meeting, I'd ask for an agenda. That alone filtered away more than half of the meetings. When I did receive an agenda, I could often reply: "Based on the agenda, I believe you'll find everything you need to know here. If not, please let me know what's missing so that I can update the document" I'd attach said document. By
[22:51:16] <feepbot> doing that, I eliminated ninety percent of my meetings. Notice what I did. I changed the communication structure at least locally around me.
