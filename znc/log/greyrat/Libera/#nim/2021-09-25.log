[08:12:23] <FromDiscord> <garett> I’m writing a Nim script to convert vk.xml into Nim.
[08:13:25] <FromDiscord> <garett> Similar to what nimgl/vulkan does, but formatted differently
[08:15:12] <FromDiscord> <garett> I produce one Nim module per API version, v1_0.nim, v1_1.nim, v1_2.nim, and one module per extension
[08:16:09] <FromDiscord> <garett> At the time I was writing the generator for struct initializer procs that autofill sType
[08:21:38] <FromDiscord> <garett> I’ve also written some macros that rewrite Nim to GLSL, so the goal is to write shader code and imperative pipeline configuration in a Nim DSL, somewhat like Unity shaderlab, so I can write the CPU/GPU code for render passes in a single Nim module.  Cool thing about generating GLSL/HLSL from Nim is that the shader code can directly reference types that are also exposed to the surrounding CPU-side Nim code
[08:23:06] <FromDiscord> <garett> Reducing redundancy between shader and CPU code, simplifying binding
[08:23:42] <FromDiscord> <garett> 🤓
[08:24:19] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> did you see https://github.com/treeform/shady for some inspiration?

[08:25:58] <FromDiscord> <Stuffe> How come the assert triggers in this example: https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3zTv
[08:26:40] <FromDiscord> <Stuffe> I am trying to use a sequence of references, but it doesn't seem to work the way you (or I at least) would expect
[08:29:04] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> In reply to @Stuffe "How come the assert": because "result[] = x" copies x into result[]
[08:29:33] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> you can't really do what you want here as it'll be unsafe because stack-allocated objects (typical `object`) are, well, on stack, so if you go out of scope they'll get deallocated
[08:29:59] <FromDiscord> <garett> I thought a ref T had to be initialized from a new T
[08:30:09] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> there are multiple ways of initializing ref T
[08:30:58] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> This is a bug afaict
[08:31:10] <FromDiscord> <Stuffe> In reply to @Yardanico "you can't really do": Would there be any way to do this if I just wanted a seq of refs allocated on the heap?
[08:31:11] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> @ElegantBeef is it?
[08:31:28] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Oh wait nvm
[08:31:28] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> In reply to @Stuffe "Would there be any": then my_chair should be a ref too
[08:31:28] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> that's a `var chair`
[08:31:31] <FromDiscord> <Rika> lol
[08:31:47] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Well i mean i think it's still a bug
[08:32:00] <FromDiscord> <Stuffe> I am really iterating over a tree and I want a list of the nodes in the path to the current location
[08:32:01] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Cause you're assigning the struct of a ref to a struct
[08:32:03] <FromDiscord> <Stuffe> speed is not an issue
[08:32:12] <FromDiscord> <Stuffe> So I don't mind how its done
[08:32:13] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> input shouldnt mutate when assigning the width of that ref's struct
[08:32:14] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> @ElegantBeef look into the code
[08:32:16] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> new(result); result[] = x
[08:32:21] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> result[] = x does a copy of x
[08:32:33] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> so the assert fails obviously
[08:32:40] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Oh fuck yea
[08:32:46] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> The assert fails 😛
[08:32:47] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> because the chair object in block_stack[^1] is not the same as `input` passed into the proc
[08:32:48] <FromDiscord> <Rika> bruh
[08:32:51] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> This is expected
[08:33:01] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Sorry i looked up from compiler code
[08:33:04] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> lol
[08:33:04] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I'll shush
[08:33:06] <FromDiscord> <Rika> you should store input.box and check against that, input never gets mutated
[08:33:42] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I was so confused how the the `input.width` got set to 10 and i was like 99% certain it was a bug, but my brain was being dumb
[08:33:43] <FromDiscord> <Stuffe> What I want is a mutable list of parent nodes
[08:33:52] <FromDiscord> <Rika> which you do get
[08:34:03] <FromDiscord> <Rika> you just have to take the `ref T` and not the `T` to see the changes
[08:34:34] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> @Stuffe
[08:34:35] <FromDiscord> <Stuffe> In reply to @Rika "you just have to": I am not sure what you mean, could you make a quick example?
[08:34:41] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> sent a code paste, see https://paste.rs/pXV
[08:34:47] <FromDiscord> <Rika> thios passes https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/371759389889003532/891188460877140028/unknown.png
[08:35:10] <FromDiscord> <Stuffe> Perfect!
[08:35:12] <FromDiscord> <Stuffe> thank you
[08:35:13] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> and yeah, you don't need "box" in this case as it doesn't work the way you want anyway
[08:35:28] <FromDiscord> <Stuffe> ok, got it
[08:35:44] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> there are also view types, but they're still in an experimental phase https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual_experimental.html#view-types
[08:35:49] <FromDiscord> <garett> https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3zTB
[08:35:51] <FromDiscord> <Rika> yeah you need the ref type outside the proc so you can still see the changes...
[08:36:26] <FromDiscord> <Stuffe> Ok I understand it now. Thanks guys 🙂
[08:36:49] <FromDiscord> <garett> ref T in Nim is not like T& in C++
[08:36:54] <FromDiscord> <Rika> do you come from rust? just asking this feels like it
[08:37:24] <FromDiscord> <garett> ref T is more like shared_ptr<T>
[08:37:30] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Ref is just a gc managed pointer
[08:37:42] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> In reply to @garett "ref T in Nim": well obviously, ref T is a managed reference, but T& is taking a raw pointer
[08:37:58] <FromDiscord> <Rika> its not so obvious to otehr people
[08:38:07] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> nim has `addr` (that is unsafe) if you need to take a raw pointer of something
[08:40:02] <FromDiscord> <garett> Not to surprising that someone coming from C++ might think a Nim ref is like a C++ “reference”
[08:40:13] <FromDiscord> <garett> (edit) "to" => "too"
[08:40:35] <FromDiscord> <Rika> yeah
[08:41:36] <FromDiscord> <garett> I had some fun figuring out how to safely manage raw pointer life cycle in Nim when getting started
[08:42:00] <FromDiscord> <garett> Especially if you want the pointer to be owned by a closure
[08:43:34] <FromDiscord> <garett> The ‘reset‘ keyword and `=destroy` together can make it work
[08:46:18] <FromDiscord> <garett> Closures are super nice to work with, but they are managed memory
[08:47:11] <FromDiscord> <garett> Nim has a few syntactic bits that are a bit ugly, but mostly I really enjoy reading and writing it
[09:19:00] <FromDiscord> <wizardlink> :tooruThinking:
[09:19:08] <FromDiscord> <wizardlink> is it possible to do multiline conditions?
[09:19:48] <FromDiscord> <wizardlink> I've been trying to figure out how I'd do `if ... and ...` with multiline but couldn't find an answer
[09:19:57] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> new line after `and` or `or`
[09:20:16] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Operators can new line fine
[09:20:51] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> sent a code paste, see https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3zTL
[09:21:21] <FromDiscord> <wizardlink> I... Didn't think about that. What is the technical reason for that? Just curious really.
[09:21:59] <FromDiscord> <wizardlink> sent a code paste, see https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3zTM
[09:22:03] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I imagine just how operators work
[09:22:04] <FromDiscord> <wizardlink> (edit) "https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3zTM" => "https://paste.rs/beb"
[09:22:31] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> when you hit an operator you know the next thing needs to be a statement
[09:23:12] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> And that applies to all operators except postfix ones
[09:23:24] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> But there is only a few postfix operators
[09:25:18] <FromDiscord> <wizardlink> Yes, that makes sense actually.
[09:25:39] <FromDiscord> <wizardlink> Thanks beef! Have a good one. :Daijobu:
[09:26:12] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> No problem, surprised those emojis make it across the bridge
[09:26:55] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> In reply to @garett "I had some fun": I haven't seen you around the community much but it's good to have another C++ dev using Nim 🙂
[09:27:11] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and if you've been around for a while - I apologize, I just have been very like busy with life
[09:27:14] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> going through some shit atm
[09:27:32] <FromDiscord> <garett> Thanks, I’ve grown tired of all the curly braces
[09:27:34] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> And he never says it's good to see me using nim so you best take that happiness 😛
[09:27:45] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> but glad you're using Nim and glad you are using Vulkan because I'm writing my renderer right now using https://github.com/martty/vuk + vkbootsrap atm

[09:27:52] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> lol I love beef
[09:28:18] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and yeah I had to go through the whole deep drive into Nim's memory model and compare it to my knowledge of C and C++ as well
[09:28:25] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and then like figure out the whole concurrency story
[09:28:38] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and how to write multithreaded code without running into deadlocks and sigsve
[09:28:42] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> (edit) "sigsve" => "sigsevs"
[09:28:50] <FromDiscord> <garett> In reply to @Gumber "but glad you're using": Very cool
[09:28:52] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> dealt with the Nim runtime pre arc/orc and move semantics and raii semantics
[09:29:07] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> so I had to like figure out in my own head why I couldn't run two nim runtimes
[09:29:10] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and build like a plugin system
[09:29:18] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> figured out eventually it was all because like each runtime as a gc
[09:29:20] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and they stop on one another
[09:29:31] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and there''s a flag to not include the gc in the nim runtime if you're building a shared lib
[09:29:32] <FromDiscord> <Rika> In reply to @Elegantbeef "But there is only": a few? only one you mean?
[09:29:34] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> but then half the std lib doesn't work
[09:29:47] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> so like I went through all the plains of trying to parallelize work across cores
[09:29:54] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and just like stumbled for years with it and Nim
[09:30:02] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and then arc / orc arrived and EVERYTHING changed
[09:30:11] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I just didn't grok everything about low level stuff back then and now I do
[09:30:20] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> autodidact so top down
[09:30:27] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and really bad adult ADHD that I just figured out a few weeks ago
[09:30:34] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> so like learning it for me took a LONG time and was hell
[09:30:39] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> but now I love using Nim with C and C++
[09:30:50] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> game and game engine is finally coming along after like six years of rewrites and R&D
[09:31:01] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and Nim is fitting the bill VERY nicely
[09:31:03] <FromDiscord> <garett> I like orc, don’t use much ref types yet other than closures
[09:31:06] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Oh right i was going to abuse myself to try and fix your C++ bug
[09:31:20] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Look at these people using closures
[09:31:23] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I basically use manually memory allocation for everything that I think might cross a thread boundary
[09:31:33] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and before I really understood closure iterators
[09:31:47] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I wrote myself a multithreaded job system in Nim using fibers implemented in boost context lib with assembly
[09:31:57] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and I just would get a version of it without all the bost crap in it
[09:31:59] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I pretty much never use closures, though do use a CPS iterator for my window manager layout engine
[09:32:08] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> so it was just the assembly for each cpu arch / instruction set
[09:32:12] <FromDiscord> <Rika> closures are very useful
[09:32:15] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and I could wrap that with nim
[09:32:18] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> compile it to object files
[09:32:19] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> interop with it
[09:32:26] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and I had fibers on like linux and mac and windows now
[09:32:29] <FromDiscord> <garett> I’m a Luddite using VirtualAlloc/map for any allocation 😛
[09:32:33] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Uh oh rika going to lose their mind about my limited closure usage
[09:32:38] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> heh hey I feel you
[09:32:50] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I mean manual memory allocation is nice because then you can do sstuff like track leaks
[09:32:54] <FromDiscord> <Rika> In reply to @Elegantbeef "Uh oh rika going": i already lose my mind from you existing
[09:32:56] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and analyze memory usage by subsystem etc
[09:33:04] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> but when you start mixing managed and manual memory
[09:33:18] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> you just like have to do it right and make sure you think about what you're doing more closely - I feel like anyway
[09:33:27] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Fuck yea never knew my existence brought so much displeasure, i now have a reason to live!
[09:33:31] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> this is my first time working in this type of hybrid approach so I'm still figuring things out
[09:34:00] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> but I def lean very heavliy on malloc and pointers
[09:34:06] <FromDiscord> <garett> Sounds like you’ve written some cool stuff
[09:34:23] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and less on the Nim runtime unless it's in userland or I know it just will stay on a single thread and doesn't require any shared memory
[09:34:33] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> https://github.com/zacharycarter is my github
[09:34:39] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> lots of dead projects on there but it's just like all prototype R&D stuff
[09:34:47] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> trying out different techniques and building differnt subsystems
[09:34:57] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> last piece is the renderer and I'm getting to the point where I"m drawing things now
[09:35:03] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and have a render graph implementation under the hood
[09:35:09] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> so a very nice abstraction to sit on top of vulkan
[09:35:25] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and once that is done, the actual game dev begins - so alpha should be sometime next year I think
[09:35:58] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and https://zacattack.io/ is my website that hasn't been updated in like 4 years or so haha

[09:37:30] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I can cobble something together that looks okay
[09:37:38] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> plus like a lot of nimmers helped me with feedback and design tips and shit so it wasn't all me for sure
[09:37:44] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and it still looks like barf but whatever
[09:37:50] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I stopped paying the bills on it
[09:38:05] <FromDiscord> <garett> Working on Rec Room these days.  Bloodlines 2 was a sinking ship
[09:38:07] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I'm out of gamedev and happy about it (profesionally) and I don't feel like I need to advertise myself anymore, I'm old now and I like my job
[09:38:22] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I saw a lot of negative feedback around bloodlines and like perf optimizatoina nd stuff
[09:38:25] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> (edit) "optimizatoina nd" => "optimizatoin and"
[09:38:30] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> but I didn't want to say anything xD

[09:39:01] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> rec room looks cool
[09:39:16] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> in 2019 / 2020 I was working for -
[09:39:18] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> https://frogmind.com/
[09:39:20] <FromDiscord> <garett> Game was beautiful, art and level design were solid, but the engineering was very junior
[09:39:29] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and they had just started that hypehype early access project
[09:39:43] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> like when i had to leave, we had just finished cooking up an alpha for it
[09:39:47] <FromDiscord> <garett> (edit) "Game" => "Bloodlines 2"
[09:39:52] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and were like starting to make plans for an eventual soft launch
[09:40:10] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> In reply to @garett "Bloodlines 2 was beautiful,": that was kind of the impression I was left with from reading steam reviews but I didn't want to jump to conclusions
[09:40:27] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I was thinking about giving it a shot eventually, I just haven't had any time lately to game
[09:40:34] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> but now that you've said that I guess I probably will pass
[09:41:39] <FromDiscord> <garett> Still, I got to do some fun stuff.  Made an IMGUI for Unreal that made some really complex tools super easy to write
[09:43:25] <FromDiscord> <garett> The timeline in that animation tool is all custom IMGUI, which let me live recompile the GUI while the Unreal editor was running
[09:43:49] <FromDiscord> <garett> Super fast iteration 😊
[09:44:55] <FromDiscord> <garett> Games I’ve enjoyed this year are Valheim, Jupiter Hell, and Deathloop
[09:46:23] <FromDiscord> <garett> @Gumber what is your Twitter handle?
[09:46:51] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> Nice that does sound fun and like an interesting project
[09:46:54] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I haven't really played many games
[09:46:57] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I got super deep into COH2
[09:47:03] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and Crowfall for a minute but that game was terible
[09:47:11] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I'm very weird with games because of my ADHD
[09:47:14] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> Aw zach you have a cockatoo
[09:47:14] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> what a bro
[09:47:20] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> I have a wiero and a sun conure

[09:47:34] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> it was my parents bird - I loved it it was my bff
[09:47:48] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> but like it had issues - and honestly like armed with the knowledge I have now
[09:47:54] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I think like all my pets have had major issues because of me lol
[09:48:05] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and potentially the other half of my family that I supsect has ADHD
[09:48:09] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> Awww shit dawg it was even named pearl
[09:48:10] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> because like now I can see that shit in my dogs lol
[09:48:13] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> my wiero is pearl hahahaha

[09:48:19] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> crazy shit man
[09:48:26] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> but yeah the bird had issues
[09:48:30] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and when my parents got older
[09:48:41] <FromDiscord> <garett> G’night folks
[09:48:46] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> they like couldn't go into the other room to watch tv because it would just squack loud af constantly when it was alone by itself in a room

[09:49:21] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> yeah I might have to get another one once I get my ADHD  under control
[09:49:25] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and if my wife will let me
[09:49:28] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> we'll see
[09:49:41] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I feel like now I have the capacity to like work with my dogs
[09:49:44] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> I think birds always hate being alone though
[09:49:51] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> whereas before I would just like get furstrated bey ond ability to work with them aftert like 2 minutes
[09:49:57] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and no routine whatsoever
[09:50:02] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> yeah but this was like

[09:50:07] <FromDiscord> <Rika> #offtopic
[09:50:08] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and we're in a room over

[09:50:58] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> like traditionally this stuff is okay
[09:51:05] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> i mean sure there's not a lot of people here, but IMO it's not a good idea to use main for offtopic so much when there's no one around here
[09:51:06] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> fine if we want to change or start enforcing stuff but like
[09:51:14] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> okay that's fine
[09:51:19] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> let's just like communicate that
[09:51:23] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and not just like #offtopoic people
[09:51:29] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> (edit) "#offtopoic" => "#offtopic"
[09:51:37] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> because that's not the way it's been for a long time

[10:07:39] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I just wonder if an imported pointer should be a distinct type
[10:07:49] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Implicitly it makes sense
[10:08:41] <FromDiscord> <xflywind> That directly using `distinct xxx` doesn't work for importc types is a known issue though. So `AliasImpl` must be used.
[10:09:12] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> It's not a tagged issue on github!

[10:41:26] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Someone link treeform genny and pynin
[10:41:33] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Having the ability to force style only really makes sense if you can force it to match your preferred

[11:50:38] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Which is why most languages don’t make it illegal…
[11:51:02] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Man I don’t get it
[11:51:10] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Neither sensitivity or insensitivity are perfect
[11:52:04] <FromDiscord> <Rika> His second point is wrong
[11:52:39] <FromDiscord> <Rika> His fourth one is invalid as well
[11:52:54] <FromDiscord> <Rika> So the only actual issues is the “style debate” and the searching

[18:17:18] <FromDiscord> <Dylan> Yeah I mean I don't see the Apache 2 or MIT licensed packages in most of the README's.
[18:17:40] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> MIT is more freedom i think
[18:17:50] <federico3> Dylan: nimble.directory is not making assumptions or usind defaults
[18:17:55] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Actually I guess most packages have a “license” header, Apache or not
[18:18:12] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Header as in on the readme
[18:19:42] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> or a license file
[18:20:19] <FromDiscord> <Rika> There is a license file right
[18:20:20] <federico3> also the .nimble file usually has the license in it
[18:20:22] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> he does have a license file though
[18:20:34] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> so no issue
[18:20:48] <federico3> Dylan: what are your repos?
[18:20:48] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> yeah nah he doesnt have to do anything extra AFAICT
[18:21:02] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> he’s gucci
[18:21:10] <FromDiscord> <Dylan> I just added it, yeah that makes sense for missing a LICENSE file. Sometimes GPL 3 gets a lot of hate and just making sure it didn't rub anyone the wrong way
[18:21:10] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> yeah, that I said was only a suggestion, nothing more
[18:21:35] <FromDiscord> <Dylan> what do you mean?↵(<@709044657232936960_federico3=5b=49=52=43=5d>)
[18:22:31] <FromDiscord> <Dylan> Hopefully everyone is fine with it being GPL 3. I mean if a company really wanted to do damage to the protections there's really nothing I could do about it.
[18:23:21] <federico3> I certainly am
[18:24:52] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Indifferent in my case since I don’t really code as much as others
[18:25:29] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> There is a guy who uses 'private' license
[18:25:58] <federico3> what's a "private" license?
[18:26:06] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Proprietary?
[18:26:12] <FromDiscord> <Dylan> Sorry just had to make sure GPL 3 wasn't going to be the reason the project dies in attractiveness, some people really hate GPL 3
[18:26:16] <FromDiscord> <Rika> “Look but no use”?
[18:26:26] <FromDiscord> <Dylan> I love GPL 3 because it makes large companies like Discord disclose that they're using open-source software.
[18:26:29] <FromDiscord> <Rika> In reply to @Dylan "Sorry just had to": Inevitably it could really
[18:26:55] <federico3> a lot of stuff on github is proprietary simply because authors don't put any FLOSS license in the repo
[18:27:05] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> https://github.com/al6x/pl0t/blob/main/license
[18:28:02] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Is that legally sound?
[18:28:03] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Ah yes, proprietary

[18:28:52] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Yeah always scary using licenses no one has checked
[18:29:03] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Well his choice
[18:29:08] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> I wouldn't say anything if he didn't put it on nimble
[18:29:49] <federico3> unfortunately there's still no review process around the nimble list

[18:35:41] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> "let" is computed at runtime but the variable itself is immutable

[18:35:59] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> const/let/var have nothing to do with scoping, it's always the same regardless of whatever you're using

[18:36:44] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Void usage is okay I would say
[18:36:47] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> well, you can access the time the code was compiled at
[18:37:03] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> with CompileTime and CompileDate constants (defined in the system module which is always imported implicitly)
[18:37:21] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> it's in string format, but yeah
[18:40:59] <FromDiscord> <Dylan> I do have a legit question though. Is there any pure library for the HttpClient that supports SSL as well? Currently it relies on native sockets which isn't very pure of you to do (doesn't work in JS).
[18:41:23] <FromDiscord> <Dylan> I saw a few PR's that were implementing backend JS HTTP and fetch on the nim-lang repo. They got merged, but where are they now?

[18:48:07] <FromDiscord> <Dylan> My first plan after this Matrix library is done is to make Discord bridge.
[18:48:16] <FromDiscord> <federico3> that its so weird. Matrix is natively integrated with Libera.chat
[18:48:25] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Yardanico already made one

[19:40:38] <FromDiscord> <Dylan> I could. I was making a TypeScript based Matrix SDK, but there's already one that exists. The current one that exists by turt2live is .... messy. Maybe I might get back to producing one but for now I want to focus on Nim and hopefully keep it 100% pure

[19:41:48] <FromDiscord> <Dylan> True, I was originally going to do that with Kotlin but Kotlin to JS compiler is really unstable right now which brought me to Nim
[19:41:52] <FromDiscord> <Dylan> So I hope to make it 100% pure just for that cause

[22:00:36] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> okay
[22:00:41] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> so you prob want x64 to be honest

[22:00:55] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> which you're most likely not on

[22:01:05] <FromDiscord> <NullCode> many of my friends have x86 systems

[22:01:13] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and target 32 bit architectures

[22:02:27] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> if you're using a 32 bit nim compiler and not a 64 bit one you will need to make sure any other compiler or whatever you might use if you interop etc will have to be 32 bit too

[22:50:13] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> okay well
[22:50:17] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I was hoping that would fix it
[22:50:19] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and I'm sorry it didn't
[22:50:24] <naquad> i've skimmed through it, i'm now more interested in async stuff and heavy oop (it looks like this is not being used much in Nim)
[22:50:57] <naquad> and multithreading
[22:51:36] <FromDiscord> <NullCode> In reply to @Gumber "and I'm sorry it": it's fine
[22:51:54] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> okay @NullCode I forgot that mingw is basically just gcc/g++
[22:52:01] <FromDiscord> <NullCode> yes
[22:52:07] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I use vcc on windows
[22:52:36] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> anywho with gcc/g++ you can add folder's to the linker's search path using the `-L` flag when you call `mingw.exe`
[22:52:43] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> to do this you have a couple of options
[22:53:02] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> but probably the best for you is going to be either drop `pcre.dll` in the same folder as `mingw.exe`
[22:53:06] <FromDiscord> <NullCode> also for clarification↵this is the cmd I'm using↵`nim c --passc:"-DPCRE_STATIC" --passl:"-static -lpcre" onefile.nim`
[22:53:10] <FromDiscord> <NullCode> In reply to @Gumber "but probably the best": i see
[22:53:12] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> or `ld.exe` rather
[22:53:19] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and you should have the path to that
[22:53:22] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> in the terminal
[22:53:28] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> oh
[22:53:33] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I see
[22:53:46] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> so you're trying to statically link pcre okay
[22:53:59] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> then you also need `pcre.lib`
[22:54:01] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> on Windows
[22:54:06] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and the linker has to be able to find that
[22:54:18] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> do you understand the difference between static and dynamic linking?
[22:55:13] <FromDiscord> <NullCode> In reply to @Gumber "so you're trying to": yep yep
[22:55:26] <FromDiscord> <NullCode> thats what I've been trying to achieve for the past couple hours lma
[22:55:37] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I'm sorry I didn't realize that
[22:55:38] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> okay so
[22:55:42] <FromDiscord> <Rika> I thought you also did the PCRE part of what I sent you
[22:55:51] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> yeah find `pcre.lib` and make sure your linker can find it
[22:55:59] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> put `pcre.dll` in your linkers path - it prob already is
[22:56:00] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Find or make it
[22:56:13] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> well you can probably just download a prebuilt binary of pcre
[22:56:19] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> that will include the `.lib` and `.dll` folders
[22:56:28] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> but you need to get the same version and cpu arch that nim was compiled with
[22:56:31] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> as well as the same compiler
[22:56:34] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> so it might be a bit tricky
[22:56:45] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I'm sure we distriibute it somewhere.....
[22:56:49] <FromDiscord> <NullCode> In reply to @Gumber "I'm sorry I didn't": i shouldve told you first ;-;
[22:56:50] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> but I've never tried to link `pcre.lib` before
[22:56:52] <FromDiscord> <Rika> So better built then
[22:56:52] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> it's all good haha
[22:56:55] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> wekk
[22:56:56] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> well
[22:57:01] <FromDiscord> <NullCode> In reply to @Rika "I thought you also": yeah no
[22:57:03] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> you'd still have to use the same compiler you build Nim with I imagine
[22:57:12] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and they didn't build their nim install
[22:57:14] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> soooooo
[22:57:19] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> you either will have to build Nim too
[22:57:25] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Well yeah but if you used finish bat then it’s his computer’s compiler
[22:57:34] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> is it?
[22:57:37] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> okay
[22:57:43] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I thought Nim was already built at that point
[22:57:46] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Is it not or what I don’t know for sure
[22:57:49] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and `finish.exe` just downloaded and built tooling
[22:57:53] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> yeah I don't think it is Rika
[22:57:57] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I think it just installs like mingw
[22:58:03] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and then some tooling
[22:58:12] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I don't think it builds anything related to the Nim runtime / compiler
[22:58:16] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Okay
[22:58:21] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Do you have patience
[22:58:25] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> not much
[22:58:27] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Because it takes a while to build Nim
[22:58:28] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Not you
[22:58:31] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> lol I know I was jk
[22:58:32] <FromDiscord> <Rika> I mean uh
[22:58:38] <FromDiscord> <Rika> What was his name
[22:58:39] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> it's not bad at all on windows
[22:58:43] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Bull
[22:58:47] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> it's like running a `.bat` file
[22:58:49] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Null
[22:58:51] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and then messing with some system paths
[22:58:55] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> that's it
[22:59:00] <FromDiscord> <Rika> I mistresses
[22:59:04] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Uh
[22:59:06] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Whatever
[22:59:10] <FromDiscord> <Rika> It’s four am
[22:59:13] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> xD
[22:59:19] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> go to sleep!
[22:59:31] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> it's good for you 🙂
[23:03:49] <FromDiscord> <NullCode> In reply to @Rika "It’s four am": 1:30 here
[23:11:33] <FromDiscord> <NullCode> In reply to @Gumber "but you need to": yikes that won't be fun at all
[23:11:35] <FromDiscord> <NullCode> ill still try
[23:13:32] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> yeah :/
[23:13:53] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Welcome to static linking
[23:14:03] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Easier on Linux from my experience
[23:14:23] <Pyautogui> I dislike the re module's API. Are there any alternatives?
[23:14:51] <FromDiscord> <Rika> nre
[23:15:08] <Pyautogui> Thanks.
[23:43:16] <FromDiscord> <treeform> I did not like re's API till i discovered =~ i like that part
[23:43:26] <FromDiscord> <deech> Is there a way to pass a string to a C++ template using the `importcpp` syntax, eg. I'd like to bind to something like : `foo<"blah">()` and I'm trying: `proc p... {.importcpp: "foo<what-goes-here?>" .}` and call it with something like `p["blah"]()`. I could make this a template but I thought I'd ask if there was some other way.
[23:43:47] <FromDiscord> <deech> (edit) ""foo<what-goes-here?>"" => ""foo<what-goes-here?>()""
[23:47:38] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> You can try `proc[S: static[string]](): {.importcpp: "foo<\"" & S & "\">(@)".}`
[23:48:11] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Otherwise you need to roll your own template, I don't think there is an alternative to that
[23:52:05] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> sent a code paste, see https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3zY7
[23:52:39] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> importcpp does not work because "cannot generate expression for 'S'", which I don't know how to fix
[23:54:16] <FromDiscord> <dom96> `proc p(s: static[string]) {.importcpp: "foo<@>()".}` tried something like this?
[23:54:43] <FromDiscord> <dom96> `@` might be wrong, can't remember which symbol is replaced with the first parameter
