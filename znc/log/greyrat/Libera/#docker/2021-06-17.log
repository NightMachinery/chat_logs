[04:31:46] <jsvana> Hi! I'm trying to debug a Dockerfile I'm creating, but I can't get logs from my container. The file is here: https://github.com/jsvana/uwiki/blob/master/Dockerfile and the command I'm building with is "docker build -t uwiki -f Dockerfile ." I'm trying to run it with "docker run -p 1181:1181 -e RUST_LOG=debug uwiki" but it's immediately exiting. I also tried with docker-compose with this file:
[04:31:48] <jsvana> https://pastebin.com/wbh1xLf9. The container just enters a restart loop with no logs (docker ps+docker logs) and I can't enter a shell with docker exec -it because it's restarting. Any idea how to get logs?

[11:26:08] <ricklamers> I’ve had a funky issue the other day. But perhaps it’s just because of my misunderstanding. I ran a Python script inside a container based on image `a27c` (to give it a name for convenience). It tool quite long, but it was just two import lines and a single print statement (importing pandas and sklearn). When I re-ran the same image but as a new container the execution was suddenly near instant. If it weren’t for the 
[11:26:08] <ricklamers> containerization I wouldn’t be super surprised: CPython might cache bytecode somewhere. But as far as I understand disk state is not persistent across containers as their FS layers on top of the image layer that a container is started with.
[11:28:01] <ricklamers> OS is Linux (Ubuntu) and no mounts or volumes were involved (where it could have stored bytecode)

[14:22:39] <Habbie> ricklamers, it's not really a cache that spans containers; programmerq is suggesting that the second time was faster because the -image- did not have to be read from disk again
[14:29:53] *** Joins: maret (~textual@nat-88-212-37-89.antik.sk)
[14:39:01] <ricklamers> habbie, is the linux filesystem cache (I guess that refers to Page Cache) persisted across reboots? The slowness (17s instead of 2-4s) disappears after running the script in the container once. Even after rebooting the instance (after executing the script in the container once - which runs slowly at 17s), the second run (in a new container) is fast (2-4s).
[14:39:30] <Habbie> ricklamers, it's not, although in a VM environment, the question might be 'what did you reboot'
[14:42:51] <ricklamers> Habbie, "in a VM environment" that might be the issue here. I think longer periods between stopping and starting an instance did show the slowness re-appearing. But this is trickier to reproduce due to long waiting times.
[14:42:51] <ricklamers> Thanks for pointing out that the difference might be explained by the image itself being in filesystem cache.

[20:42:22] <CodeGeek> how do you setup a docker standalone server on Linux so that it doesn't automatically expose every container's port to the internet, if the server is also running iptables to block everything?
[20:43:36] <CodeGeek> is the only option to disable iptables from docker and wire the networks manually?
[20:48:35] <tabakhase> CodeGeek uh? it doesnt do that
[20:49:06] <ilius> The host needs network configuration, and part of that should also be managing iptables.  It's better if you have a firewall in front of your entire network, but an iptables firewall on the host is next-best.

[20:50:16] <artok> just don't flush what docker does
[20:51:05] <tabakhase> and thats not even that you have to "block the access to the container" - but more so "docker needs to explicitly publish it by making shenanigans to "publish" - docker stuff runs in a virtual network (the docker0 interface) and your host has to act as a router for anything to get there
[20:51:23] *** Quits: xorex (~xorex@ircdoos.koppelvlak.net) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[20:51:29] <GyrosGeier> also, normally ports aren't exposed unless you bridge your network with the Ethernet
[20:51:46] <GyrosGeier> and then a firewall won't help you, because the bridge bypasses that
[20:52:23] <tabakhase> CodeGeek i wonder, is your real question: "use -p 127.0.0.1:80:80 instead of -p 80:80"? --- this defaults to 0.0.0.0 - and this default can also be changed in daemon.json
[20:54:09] *** night_wulfe_ is now known as night_wulfe
[20:54:14] <CodeGeek> tabakhase: ok, so let's say I want to expose certain containers to the internet (nginx), and other containers just between themselves (wp<->mysql). Would the latter be able to connect to each other with 
[20:54:33] <CodeGeek> "-p 127.0.0.1:3306:3306"
[20:54:46] <tabakhase> CodeGeek for docker-to-docker you dont have to publish the port at all
[20:55:49] <tabakhase> (and when the containers share a "user defined network" they can resolve each other by name ontop) -- so wp uses "mysql:3306" to connect to the db and will find your "mysql:" service from the compose-file or such

[22:14:16] <larsks> Swahili: You can't "map" a host port into the container, but you can access services running on your host *from* the container.
[22:15:40] <notevil> Swahili: you can publish 127.0.0.1:8000:80 to connect docker localhost 8000 to the container's 80.  (is that what you were asking?)
[22:15:47] <Swahili> larsks: thanks for your help! that'll be "access services", not "mapping". In practice `-p XXXX:YYYY`, correct?
[22:16:10] <Swahili> notevil: yeh
[22:16:16] <larsks> Well, -p is for mapping *container* ports on the host, which is the opposite direction of what you were asking.
[22:16:55] <Swahili> larsks: ok thanks for confirming, it's not `-p`
[22:20:04] <Swahili> that'll be `-P`, as long as I use EXPOSE in the Dockerfile?
[22:20:50] *** Joins: slaughter (~slaughter@europa.whatbox.ca)
[22:22:48] <slaughter> I need to setup a remote host (EC2) for Docker dev due to M1 Mac issues - haven't done much remote host dev before, though I'm plenty familiar with SSH etc - would love to know if there's a "best practices" or anything I could review? Searching is just turning up a lot of things about remote work and VSCode extensions. Specifically going to use this host for Docker, so Docker-centric things would be great
[22:23:38] <aab_> you don't need to ping containers or hosts really
[22:23:46] <aab_> if they up you should be able to connect to them
[22:24:00] <slaughter> And since searches are turning up the same thing a lot - I'm not looking to use a Docker container as a development environment, I'm looking to setup an EC2 to build/run containers in dev since they blow up on my M1
[22:24:30] <Lutin> aab_ no but if you know you can ping the ip you should be able to ping the hostname
[22:24:52] <aab_> depends on internal network settings
[22:24:56] <aab_> and how dns is done
[22:25:14] <aab_> and if it's an outside dns or inside or split dns
[22:28:55] <Lutin> aab_ no DNS implemented yet, just native docker
[22:29:10] <Lutin> with it's own DNS
[22:32:50] <Swahili> The solution I found to access the host port from the docker container, was very simple, used the host ip address!

[22:40:07] <Swahili> sorry I meant curl
[22:40:28] <Swahili> Thank you :
[22:40:30] <Swahili> :)
[22:47:51] <Lutin> aab_ so, what do you exacly mean, internal is the thing, external is not docker related
[22:48:14] <aab_> we don't know your set up
[22:48:36] <aab_> you might be trying to ping external hosts to internal dockers of some sort or domains set up with nginx proxy manager or something
[22:51:04] <Lutin> aab_ where do you get "external" hosts from ?
[22:51:24] <Lutin> just internal, all on docker swarm... just ping a service from a container
[22:51:34] <tabakhase> Swahili beware that "host.docker.internal" doesnt work everywhere (used to be a mac only thing actually) - the "safe way" is let user privide, if none given lookup the gateway-ip in your entrypoint (what is your hosts docker0 again)
[22:52:06] <Swahili> Great : ) thank you!
[22:52:34] <tabakhase> Swahili further note on -P, yea thats "-p for things with EXPOSE" - but you see it used fairly rarely as it maps to random-port on the host ((one then has too lookup with "docker ports" commands)) - has its usecases, but rare
[22:53:07] <Swahili> tabakhase: thanks for your knowledge :)
[22:57:40] <tabakhase> slaughter anythign specific to ask yet? - in itself its pretty much a "just do..." - docker-cli is already using a "remote daemon" even on localhost, so moving that elsewhere is fully supported - only thing that obvs "wont work" is bind-mounts, here youd need to pull things down on another way first (say sshfs if thats a thing for ya?) - but for "just building" docker does all automagically 
[22:57:41] <tabakhase> (the build context gets zipped and send over even on localhost)
[22:58:08] <tabakhase> pretty much a DOCKER_HOST=ssh://... and give it 
[22:59:31] <slaughter> Eh was mostly thinking things I might need to consider when picking a host (disk size, instance class) and configuration things that people might have found handy. Maybe prematurely optimizing and should just toss up an EC2 and deal with issues as they arise

[23:06:48] <slaughter> Yeah just a pretty normal docker config, a few containers in one app, single container in another, nbd. Alright, I'll just launch an EC2 and go from there. I guess the search engines didn't find any beest practices or whatnot because they don't exist :p
[23:06:56] <Lutin> tried that as well but i lost track on the differences beween k8s and k3s... anyways... i was so happy to read that google in their docs says: Don't try to manage an k8s cluster for production on it's own... it's horrible!
[23:07:30] <Lutin> they actually say... use something like rancher!
[23:08:12] <tabakhase> running a k8s certainly goes in the region of "have your own team for it" - otherwise you are usually better of buying it from external... or "you dont need it anyhow"
[23:08:32] <Lutin> indeed!
[23:08:52] <Lutin> and they even advise to use it for dev, not eve production :)
