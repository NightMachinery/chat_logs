[00:16:48] <Colombo> never got the shiny hypetrain
[00:20:02] <tdsmith> we're using dash at work as a platform for building little applets that integrate into a lab information management system; data scientists can spin up an app to ingest results from a file format that the platform doesn't support natively. it's nice that you can arrange the UI without typing any js or css. we're mostly not using it for visualization
[00:20:10] <tdsmith> you could probably do something similar with shiny but we're a python shop
[00:23:29] <shrysr> that sounds nice tdsmith are you hiring? :) 
[00:25:51] <shrysr> i have come across datasette betfoer. It does seem nifty, maybe its me - but i still find the interface confusing and i think prolly not suitable for the kind of.. internal customers I currently cater to. I am incidentally looking for a tool though.. that I can use to share data internally that people can navigate. Like datasette. 
[00:26:18] <tdsmith> plausibly! in vancouver and montreal, anyway -- roles on https://www.abcellera.com/careers/openings#focus-big-data-machine-learning are adjacent to my team and we have a couple of headcount coming this year in my group
[00:28:07] <shrysr> AHa. i am somewhat aware of Abcellera , as in that it exists and i'm in Vancouver! I'ma check out the positions. tyvm. 
[00:28:53] <tdsmith> ah nice! usually location is a dealbreaker, hahaha
[00:30:45] <shrysr> We had sessions with PLotly/ Dash Enterprise. Rejected on price :( I liked it Very much !! the low code tools + easy deployment cut short SO MUCH of the crap that I do everyday. At the end of the day, end users of apps facing clients only care about... the UI. 
[00:31:17] <shrysr> After that I was left to fend for maself... and i 'fell' into shiny. 
[00:32:27] <shrysr> and fixing UI stuff.. takes away for me... a good portion joy in building data apps. Low code interfaces like Dash Enterprise help. 
[00:32:58] <tdsmith> yeah enterprise isn't cheap. we're rolling on to our own deployment infrastructure for it anyway because it has weird shortcomings
[00:48:12] * shrysr in meeting with the boss man who vomits - Plotly Dash License cost Alone is atleast 2X our AWS Op cost for entire app(s), including backups staging etc. We gotta pay this much for... a reporting 'tool'??  Subsequently /me was further submerged in the 'Lets code in Javaaaa' chorus. Fortunately, already being numbed by rickyrick's noxious fumes ... I survived.
[00:51:41] <shrysr> tdsmith: if I may ask would you be using FastAPI to host Dash apps? My brief attempts at that were unsuccessful.  Or would you just use a flask server? I recall there were many things to... look at whether Dash is mounted as a separate flask app, or dash app mounted in a flask server which allows access to flask libraries. 
[00:53:25] <tdsmith> aiui we're running each app with a separate instance of waitress, which is just another wsgi server, and there's something in front of it doing reverse proxying
[00:54:33] <Bayes> oh I just saw a method based on Jackknife :o
[00:56:49] <Bayes> oh I see you're still discussing shiny
[00:57:15] <Bayes> does dash leverage the client side better than shiny?
[00:58:05] <Bayes> I don't know much about shiny but the few apps I worked in had a clunky UI, click and wait 3 seconds xD
[00:58:40] <tdsmith> basically: no
[00:58:45] <Bayes> I was thinking that really what I'd like is a good wsgi on the server that does purely and exclusively the data processing and computations, and send you stuff so you can render them locally
[00:59:18] <Bayes> I mean I don't need a server that will produce a jpg and send it my way o.o
[00:59:30] <Bayes> do I?
[01:00:07] <tdsmith> in dashland you can build react components that are fully interactive on the client; surely this is also true for shiny
[01:00:42] <tdsmith> plotly might be a little more aggressive about pushing their interactive components instead of ggplot or whatever
[01:00:55] <shrysr> Well we moved on to Dash since we are piRates. Dash has some advantages because it is 'stateless'. I believe that means the app doesnt need a 'constant' connection to the server to be alive. Shiny is strictly a 'stateful' app based on websockets. In my mind - this means dash potentially offers better experience for.. less effort.

[01:02:03] <shrysr> Bayes: maybe you'd like OpenCPU. 
[01:02:18] <shrysr> Still runs on Apache. 
[01:03:10] <shrysr> But i could be wrong. It depends on the App. I suppose a larger app would benefit with state. Maybe I have it ass backwards. hmm. web tech is confusing. 
[01:05:01] <shrysr> fwiw, a dormant shiny server by itself takes a few seconds 'to warm up' and serve the shiny app after creating a session. Talk about.. slow. You have to set timeout to 0 to enable fast(er) shiny server starts and thus you are constrained about what you put in 'global.R' 
[01:06:18] <shrysr> The most important distinction, IMO between Dash and Shiny --- is that dash components can be embedded into a web page and Dash Enterprise provides the authentication glue. Shiny can ONLY be embedded as a iframe, and so called full app. 
[01:06:52] <shrysr> so you could have a little valuebox or designed counter on ANY website, pointing to that Dash component. It becomes an almost native part of your webpage. 
[01:09:08] <Bayes> gah it seems both come with their own issues
[01:09:25] <Bayes> in 2022 one day will have something better

[19:27:29] <Bayes> sup
[19:28:31] <Bayes> danshearer looks like a nice data set to set up some kind of model
[19:33:44] <danshearer> Bayes, we could do with all the help we can get. One of the reasons we are using R (aside from R having technology in common with us) is because of the 4D-type graphs. Because we have a lot of dimensions.
[19:33:49] <danshearer> But we don't yet have those skills.
[19:34:13] <danshearer> We are just regenerating cleaner and more data, and have another go.
[19:34:39] <Bayes> I mean, it seems to me you're setting up an experiment with (possibly?) two fixed effect (effects you control)
[19:35:02] <Bayes> and then data size, that probably requires a bit of thought
[19:35:41] <Bayes> but in the end if you get to lay out a (typically linear) model that's true to your experiment design, you're gonna get very nice analytics out of this
[19:36:34] <danshearer> We have many versions of LMDB that can go underneath many versions of SQLite, and those same many unmodified versions of SQLite. All of the preceding with different datasizes (because behaviour of read and write is often very different.)
[19:37:11] <Bayes> oh that's cool, cause now it'd seem you could have some random effects ^_^
[19:37:21] <Bayes> design of experiments is fascinating really
[19:37:54] <danshearer> But then there is the platform, consisting of kernel+OS+hardware, and there is a lot of variation. Many of the media types used with SQLite have radically different profiles for read and write, and from each other. But also we are using ramdisk on our cluster, which largely eliminates the media effects. We also have 32-bit vs 64-bit, because both matter a lot with SQLite.
[19:39:13] <danshearer> One of the key factors here is that this is software without precedent or peer in terms of scale. We have therefore designed a benchmarking system (generalisable) with unique run IDs and some hardware detection etc, so that we can (with sanity checking) receive benchmarking runs from anyone.
[19:39:35] <danshearer> Which will then give us embedded devices and supercomputers and many other things.
[19:40:40] <danshearer> There are also dimensions that might not be obvious. For example, switching on DEBUG isn't just a linear effect at all. Heisenbugs have habits. In fact, I have designed an alternative debugging system for SQLite that will help (and other C projects too, I'd hope.) But this needs to be measured.
[19:41:09] <Bayes> yeah looks like you'll have to put some thought into the analysis, but you seem to have a solid understanding of the underlying process and the potential sources of variations
[19:42:00] <danshearer> So, Bayes, we think we pretty much have the infrastructure for collecting, checking, cleaning and aggregating this dataset. We have a nascent bit of R code. We now need some good modelling. We do have mathematics as well as comp sci among us, but we don't really have statistical modelling. Hence my non-subtle invite to drop in to #lumosql ;-)
[19:42:27] <Bayes> lol sure
[19:43:06] <Bayes> just make sure you document all this
[19:43:54] <Bayes> really, I'm a bit less worried about linearity than having a model that captures the design of the experiment
[19:44:05] <danshearer> Random effects... well yes. We are processing many many terrabytes of data here even just in benchmarking, which means that we except random bitflips for many reasons. And we are adding checksumming and so forth to detect that... but that's another dimension: which of the several qualifying crypto algorithms for checksumming, signing and encrypting row data in a database are best for which kernel/OS/hardware and which access patterns?
[19:44:55] <Bayes> yeah I hear you
[19:45:50] <Bayes> I do experiments mostly, in my experience if you can document what you're doing, then coming up with a reasonable model shouldn't be impossible
[19:46:57] <Bayes> typically most of the struggle is with scientists not having a clear understanding on how the data were generated and not having a more or less clear idea of what questions they want to get answered
