[00:59:41] <apple-corps> Hello, I'm using rspec tests around logstash and the logstash/dev-utils ruby gem. I'm trying to get a debugger attached or perhaps first log to standard out so I can try to understand the logstash / dev-utils and ruby testing framework. I have yet been able to get logging messages via a logging library or puts when executing the rspec tests.
[00:59:42] <apple-corps> Similarly I have not yet been able to make a debugger work. I am wondering if anyone would try to help work with me towards this solution before I give in.
[01:00:09] <apple-corps> So I guess a good place to start would be to look for assistance for the logging. I would expect that to be the easiest thing to do,
[01:02:50] *** Quits: apple-corps (~discord@207.32.171.116) (Quit: Client closed)
[01:03:52] *** Joins: apple-corps (~apple-cor@207.32.171.116)
[01:08:45] <apple-corps> I'm currently executing rspec using the docker container as described on this post: https://discuss.elastic.co/t/testing-aggregates-logstash-aggregate-plugin-more-than-one-filter-which-defines-timeout-options-but-only-defining-once/289644
[01:10:12] <apple-corps> So my first goal is to write some logging to STD out interlaced with the rspec output so I can get a handle on the testing setup. I will try this again but I'm intimidated by the ruby world
[01:13:33] <apple-corps> So do any folks know a good way to write logs from an rspec test / ruby test?
[01:19:48] <weaksauce> have you tried "require 'pry'; binding.pry"
[01:22:09] <apple-corps> Not yet. I was going to try that when I got to the debugging. I was trying to make logging work. But I can try that now. I think one problem I have is managing gems. It's very difficult for me working with the logstash / jruby setup. I started using docker containers because I was having trouble setting up locally on the mac. Let me go this route
[01:22:09] <apple-corps> now.
[01:22:39] <weaksauce> do you not use bundler? 
[01:26:49] <apple-corps> No, currently I've been using https://github.com/iteratec/logstash-rspec/blob/master/Dockerfile to execute the test and here's the description where I got started with this: https://gquintana.github.io/2016/09/07/Testing-Logstash-configuration.html
[01:30:39] <apple-corps> I've also explored using https://github.com/cameronkerrnz/logstash-plugin-dev but I haven't been successful in triggering the rspec tests from that container. But I think it's Dockerfile more clearly defines the build platform including bundler calls.
[01:31:34] <apple-corps> In short it seems like the first container is just providing an execution engine to run rspec tests while the later is providing a ruby stack to build plugins. I don't need to build plugins but I am trying to test logstash configurations.
[01:32:19] <apple-corps> https://github.com/cameronkerrnz/logstash-plugin-dev/blob/master/Dockerfile
[01:32:46] <weaksauce> yeah i don't know anything about logstash

[01:33:58] <apple-corps> Looking at those two docker containers, do you think I should continue with the one that currently executes the tests or work with the one that has the clear-er use of bundler, etc and try to make it's rspec work?
[01:35:32] <apple-corps> Maybe I will drop some output from working on the later
[01:38:26] <weaksauce> does the first one work at all?
[01:38:48] <weaksauce> i'd think that the bundled rspec should work ootb
[01:39:00] <weaksauce> the plugin one seems pretty heavy handed

[01:43:01] <apple-corps> I'm not sure how to use bundler or gem in that one to install required dependencies if for example pry is missing.
[01:44:00] <weaksauce> i'd just add a new run command "RUN gem install pry" 
[01:44:06] <weaksauce> or if you don't want a layer append it 
[01:44:44] <weaksauce> that said i have no clue how bare bones the ruby is in that dockerfile 
[01:46:55] <apple-corps> hmm i seem to have had luck with the more involved container. I ran `rake test:install-default` and I seem to be installing required dependencies and I think I made rspec work in that environment where I did not before. I think this might be better because it seems to have bundler setup.
[01:48:20] <weaksauce> seems pretty well thought out so 
[01:48:24] <apple-corps> But I'm still not terribly familiar here. I think some ruby knowledge of tooling might help
[01:48:25] <weaksauce> not a bad path
[01:48:55] <apple-corps> So if I want to install another gem, what route do I go
[01:49:04] <weaksauce> bundler is the main way people generally interact with gems for a project
[01:49:18] <weaksauce> docker kinda changes that a touch but you can do it 
[01:49:40] <weaksauce> you have a gemfile and a gemfile.lock that lists all the gems you use and bundle install installs them
[01:49:54] <weaksauce> bundle exec will run whatever command in the context of those gems
[01:50:13] <weaksauce> bundle add pry would append pry to the gemfile and install it
[01:50:44] <apple-corps> ok let me try this. And what was that rake test:install-default. That seemed to get a bunch of needed things ...
[01:51:00] <weaksauce> rake is rubymake
[01:51:09] <apple-corps> Ah rake is like make. doh. hmm
[01:51:09] <weaksauce> so it is used to run things and install things
[01:51:45] <apple-corps> So where do I find the makefile def of that test:install-default ?
[01:51:56] <weaksauce> it's gonna be in a Rakefile
[01:52:04] <weaksauce> or a rake subdirectory
[01:53:46] <apple-corps> I see the Rakefile and it looks like it reads a bunch of lib dirs. But now I have some ideas what is going on. I will try bundle add something. Thanks!
[01:54:07] <weaksauce> good luck!
[01:56:25] <apple-corps> It's sort of odd. I see https://github.com/cameronkerrnz/logstash-plugin-dev/blob/master/Dockerfile#L135
[01:56:53] <apple-corps> But I get a Gem::GemNotFoundException
[01:57:03] <apple-corps> for bundler
[01:57:51] <weaksauce> is bundler bundled with jruby?
[01:57:56] <weaksauce> i don't really use jruby
[01:58:50] *** Quits: teclator (~quassel@85.155.180.70.dyn.user.ono.com) (Quit: http://quassel-irc.org - Chat comfortably. Anywhere.)
[01:59:27] <apple-corps> yeah all this logstash uses jruby. I think there might be a java core and jruby. I ran bundler and it installed a bunch of stuff.
[02:00:24] <apple-corps> so if you're a java dev or a ruby dev you don't know what the hell is going on unless you know both && jruby :D
[02:01:11] <weaksauce> hah pretty much
[02:03:02] <apple-corps> seems like the bundler is confused. I ran bundle add and it fetched a bunch of deps. Then I ran the rspec test and got an error Bundler:FemNotFound: Could not find little-plugger-1.1.4 in any of the sources.
[02:06:22] <apple-corps> maybe I installed a bad requirement for the jruby world?

[02:21:15] <weaksauce> no clue
[02:21:35] <weaksauce> never had a need for jruby
[02:32:48] <apple-corps> I think perhaps they are using their own interface to bundler to manage dependencies and then if trying to use bundler on my own things get screwed: https://github.com/elastic/logstash/blob/main/lib/pluginmanager/install.rb https://github.com/elastic/logstash/blob/main/rakelib/test.rake#L64
[02:45:38] <weaksauce> https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/1146
[02:45:59] <weaksauce> bundler should be installed per the last comment
[02:46:11] <weaksauce> are you bundle exec foo.rb 
[02:46:21] <weaksauce> well rspec instead of foo.rb
[02:47:16] <apple-corps> no I've been running the tests with rspec not bundle
[02:47:20] <weaksauce> https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/5686
[02:47:34] <weaksauce> actually the log thing is referenced in that issue
[02:47:48] <weaksauce> This is creating an issue for us in Logstash as we install our own version of Bundler
[02:49:57] <apple-corps> Ok, so I assume I want to invoke the logstash bundler if I want to add a gme
[02:50:36] <weaksauce> yeah
[02:50:50] <weaksauce> they usually have binstubs for things so that might be something to look into
[02:51:43] <apple-corps> I was trying to dig through the rake tasks to see where they provide the gem list for the development dependencies but maybe just looking for their bundler would be simpler

[07:40:17] <nakilon> weird that when I have a local gem version specified in Gemfile as path: "...", then when I do "bundle exec ruby -rthat_gem" it goes insane and requires it not from the specified path but from some default installed locaton and then versions mismatch and it crash
[07:41:18] <nakilon> but when I replace '-rsome_gem -e "..."' with -e 'require "some_gem"; ...' it does not go mad and works fine
[07:43:12] <nakilon> by "crash" I mean it somehow requires the gem twice from different locations, throws warning and then fails to redefine the VERSION; maybe it's all just because the gem I use has such weird stuff as lin/some-gem.rb: require "some_gem" though, idk
[08:27:37] <apple-corps> I'm trying to understand this ruby method https://github.com/elastic/logstash-devutils/blob/master/lib/logstash/devutils/rspec/logstash_helpers.rb#L67 in the context of the invocation   sample("message" => message, "type" => "nginx") found https://gquintana.github.io/2016/09/07/Testing-Logstash-configuration.html
[08:28:10] <apple-corps> Looking at the method signature:   def sample(sample_event, validation_source: :output, &block)
[08:29:27] <apple-corps> I would assume that the invocation: sample("message" => message, "type" => "nginx") do... calls the sample method with the sample event  set to "message"=>message
[08:30:10] *** justBOOMER is now known as justache
[08:30:39] <apple-corps> and I assume the do .. from the invocation https://gquintana.github.io/2016/09/07/Testing-Logstash-configuration.html is the &block from the signature
[08:32:02] <apple-corps> But what I don't understand, how is the hash type passed and how do i see that reflected in the method signature
[08:32:40] <apple-corps> I'm also not familiar with that  validation_source: :output syntax. Can one of the great ruby wizards elucidate me?
[08:34:25] <sam113101> it's the same as :validation_source => :output
[08:35:56] <apple-corps> sam113101 afraid I don't follow. Is that how you define hash parameters for a method in ruby?
[08:36:47] <sam113101> no, it's just sugar for hashes with symbols as keys
[08:37:06] <sam113101> you can use that syntax anywhere
[08:37:25] <sam113101> anywhere you would want a hash with symbols as keys
[08:37:36] <apple-corps>   def sample(sample_event, validation_source: :output, &block)
[08:38:11] <apple-corps> Yeah so the signature above I see 3 parameters. sample_event, validation_source: :output, &block
[08:40:37] <apple-corps> so the second parameter ``` validation_source: :output parameter ``` does that syntax mean that parameter accepts a hash or key => value pair?
[08:41:09] <sam113101> actually wait
[08:42:45] <apple-corps> guess I could try to use a ruby shell and see...
[08:43:31] <sam113101> man my ruby is rusty
[08:46:34] <sam113101> turns out that they are indeed keyword arguments
[08:47:55] <apple-corps> It's a little strange then when you look at the invocation, but maybe the signature changed or the author has a sense of humor
[08:47:59] <apple-corps> sample("message" => message, "type" => "nginx") do...
[08:48:09] <sam113101> in my days you didn't have those, you used hashes instead, but you could still write the hashes without their {}'s if they were the last argument to the function
[08:48:33] <apple-corps> https://gquintana.github.io/2016/09/07/Testing-Logstash-configuration.html
[08:49:05] <apple-corps> because it looks like sample event is "message"=>message
[08:49:31] <apple-corps> validation source is "type"=> "nginx"
[08:49:49] <apple-corps> and then I think the block is everything in the do ....
[08:49:59] <apple-corps> But still not sure if I'm reading it right
[08:50:43] <apple-corps> Do you think I am correct about these/
[08:50:45] <apple-corps> ?
[08:51:25] <sam113101> no
[08:52:06] <sam113101> sample("message" => message, "type" => "nginx") is the same as sample({"message" => message, "type" => "nginx"})
[08:52:47] <sam113101> so inside the function sample_event will be {"message" => message, "type" => "nginx"}
[08:53:34] <sam113101> :validation_source will be :output because it's the default and you're not changing it
[08:54:29] <apple-corps> so is :output the syntax you use to set a default value ?
[08:55:06] <apple-corps> Trying to understand that second parameter now that we understand the first one
[08:55:35] <apple-corps> IE what is validation_source: :output
[08:55:37] <sam113101> 'validation_source:' is a keyword argument, ':output' is its default value, which happens to be a symbol (starts with a :)
[08:56:00] <sam113101> you could have a string, integer, array, anything
[08:56:58] <sam113101> def test(a: "hello"); puts a; end
[08:58:24] <apple-corps> so is that how keyword arguments work, you can provide a default value like that. So they could have put validation_source: "candy" and it's default value would be the string candy?
[08:59:09] <sam113101> sorry if I'm slow, I started using ruby in 2011 I think and I've only used it infrequently, I'm out of the loop on everything, keyword arguments are still new to me but it seems like they've been here for a gigantic while, I don't know what happened lol
[08:59:29] <apple-corps> I think what I just said to some degree you are showing
[08:59:49] <apple-corps> in your function. So I digress.
[09:00:27] <apple-corps> So think I understand the function now. I assume I was right that the block refers to the block of code between do..end
[09:00:44] <apple-corps> &block that is
[09:00:58] <sam113101> yeah, you provide a default value that way, and when you don't then you don't have to provide a value at all, they're not required when calling the function, but you can make them required by setting no default value
[09:02:04] <sam113101> def test(a: 0); puts a; end
[09:02:16] <sam113101> you can call test without any argument, test() for example
[09:02:25] <sam113101> and a will be 0
[09:02:31] <sam113101> but if you do
[09:02:37] <sam113101> def test(a:); puts a; end
[09:02:53] <sam113101> if you call it without argument, i.e. test(), it will complain
[09:04:01] <sam113101> in my days we would use options hashes to accomplish more or less the same thing, and we had to check those things manually
[09:04:10] <sam113101> and yes &block will be the block
[09:04:42] <apple-corps> I'm trying to call that sample to test a logstash config
[09:04:59] <apple-corps> I keep passing the test in every execution, totally bogus
[09:05:23] <apple-corps> Except if I connect a debugger, then the test always fails which makes it difficult to debug
[09:12:45] <apple-corps> Seems like if I invoke the logger on subject.get("key") then I get a ConfigurationError. But it's just happy passing tests with the insist ... in the block whether insist / reject is true false :(
[09:13:05] *** Joins: jpw (~jpw@user/jpw)
[09:42:11] <apple-corps>   Then it looks like the insist / reject blocks just don't execute. When I put an expect or any code that does something I get a strange logstash configuration error.

[22:57:44] <libsys> hello people
[22:58:10] <libsys> I'm testing with minitest... how could I scope a setup function while using assert style?
[22:58:37] <libsys> like when using the spec syntax one does with describe
[22:59:30] <libsys> or I should simply create a funciton, call it on each test which uses it and be done with that

[23:49:35] <libsys> also, how could I mock `Rack::Response.new(content).finish`? I call this function inside a method and I'd like to not depend on the actual implementation of that
[23:50:08] <libsys> I could simply monkey patch the function, but that affects my other non-related tests
[23:50:20] <ox1eef> libsys: my recommendation would be to use rspec.
[23:51:45] <libsys> bruh, I'd like to stick to my current test suite xd
[23:51:50] <libsys> I've already done some tests
[23:51:54] <ox1eef> :)
[23:52:19] <ox1eef> fair enough, but it is so easy to solve that mocking issue you had with rspec. with minitest - i'm not sure, been a long, long time since i tried it.
