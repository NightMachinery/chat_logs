[02:39:56] <somiaj> remii: in this case since you are trying to show the limit is zero, you can work with absolute values which could clean some of the stuff I noticed up
[02:40:36] <somiaj> using absolute values is just another version of the squeeze theorem, where you have 0 <= limit <= 0, so thus your limit must be zero due to the squeeze theroem.
[02:41:03] <somiaj> but your logic is only showing that limit <= 0, you would also need to show the limit >= 0, and the absolute values can be used in this case to simplify this

[03:27:57] <somiaj> Using 0.5 <= |1 - cos(theta)sin^5(theta)| (checked with desmos) is why I divided by 2

[03:28:52] <remii> somiaj Yes but what I'm saying is that you wouldn't need to do that since you already made the numerator bigger by applying the triangle inequality?
[03:29:11] <remii> So |r|^6 could work?
[03:29:26] <somiaj> but did you make the numerator big enough that what you write is true for all r and theta?
[03:30:37] <somiaj> here it is a bit more solid and I don't have to worry about if I made the denominator big enough, so I just find a lower bound of |1 - cos(theta)sin^5(theta)| and use that, this way the logic is sound and I don't need to double check some other things
[03:31:00] <remii> Yea but I can't use something like desmos.
[03:31:18] <somiaj> then use calculus to find the minimim of 1 - cos(theta) sin^5(theta)
[03:31:45] <somiaj> i.e. you want a lower bound or the minimum value of that thing.

[03:34:10] <somiaj> there is also nothing special about 0.5, it was just a nice number that worked so I picked it.
[03:34:19] <remii> How do u know it worked?
[03:34:34] <somiaj> You just need to show that there is some number alpha > 0, such that alpha < 1 - cos(theta) sin^5(theta) for all theta.
[03:34:55] <somiaj> I looked at the graph on desmos and saw the minimum was around 0.741, and 0.5 is way less than that.
[03:35:02] <somiaj> as I siad if you really wanted you could use calculus
[03:35:08] <somiaj> take the derivative, set it equal to zero, work from there
[03:35:24] <remii> I did and I get arctan(sqrt(5))
[03:37:08] <somiaj> so now plug that back into 1 - cos(theta) sin^5(theta)
[03:37:22] <remii> I don't know what that is lol
[03:37:58] <somiaj> well if tan(theta) = sqrt(5) = sqrt(5)/1, using the pythogrean theroem the hypotonous is sqrt( sqrt(5)^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(6)
[03:38:15] <somiaj> so cos(theta) = 1/sqrt(6), and sin(thetA) = sqrt(5)/sqrt(6).
[03:38:35] <somiaj> 1 - (1/sqrt(6))*(sqrt(5)/sqrt(6))^5 is the min, but you just need a lower bound.
[03:39:25] <somiaj> and that is about 0.751195 which is the same number desmos gives, or if you care, it is 1 - (25/216) sqrt(5)
[03:39:37] <somiaj> but all that matters is this number is >= 0

[08:30:43] <putnam> lericson: Hey. I recomputed the points with the transformations you mentioned but the numbers are off. Clearly i'm doing something wrong. So I took the geographic landmark long/lat and transformed them into world-space cartesian coordinates. Then I shifted all the points to get the relative cartesian coordinates centered around the camera. I manually added the height offset for the camera to the z component
[08:30:49] <putnam> of the center point to account for the height. Subsequently, I calculated the point norms and rescaled all points using the norm and a sphere of radius 1. However, when I calculate the theta(azimuth) and phi(elevation), the numbers are incorrect.
[08:35:13] <putnam> I projected theta with Atan(y/x) and phi using Acos(z/|norm|).

[13:19:01] <lok91> I was asked to give a 10 minute presentation for assessment of my English skills. It can be any mathematical topic, but it will be assessed by language specialists, so I cannot assume that they know *any* university-level mathematics at all. It says "Please remember that you are presenting to non-specialists in your area" and "Be mindful of how you
[13:19:02] <lok91> explain technical terms (and how much of this information that you include)"
[13:19:03] <lok91> Any ideas for a mathematical topic which is easy to explain very intuitively? Something which does not require that you have taken any particular university-level mathematics courses? I considered matrix multiplication, but these guys might not even know what a matrix is and why matrices are useful. Again, I only have 10 minutes :P

[15:26:29] <Me-me> Oh sure. You have a number of marbles in a bag, of 15 different colours, x1..x15. You pick out n marbles from the bag at random. What are the odds that you have picked out six or more different colours in the marbles you picked?
[15:27:02] <nomagno> Where n >= 6, I assume
[15:27:23] <Me-me> I mean sure. I won't exactly need a formula to tell me that the chance in that case is 0.

[15:32:27] <Me-me> If it's so trivial, then why would nomagno assume he needed a full hour to solve it?

[19:58:19] <Decker> there's a physical gimbal lock too - which isn't really the same thing; the matrices go to too many 0's

[20:01:16] <riv> remii: so you refuse to answer my question. ok
[20:01:26] <remii> What why, because I'm studying analysis.
[20:01:29] <laurus> Decker: my point is, it seems like we don't _need_ the restrictions
[20:01:48] <Decker> but then you can't make a =5 and b=12
[20:01:50] <laurus> Decker: just call x_2 a, x_4 b, and put those into the table
[20:02:58] <laurus> For example, they say we must impose the restriction a^3 = e. But x_2^2 = x_3, from the table, giving us a^2 = x_3. Then we note that x_3 x_2 = x_1 = e from the table, so a^2 a = e, so a^3 = e.
[20:03:09] <laurus> So from the table, I found that a^3 = e, without having to impose that restriction.

[20:56:13] <SJrX> I understand that the complex numbers are defined as a+bi where i^2=-1, but in that case you are defining a new element, because there is no element in R with that property, but in the case of the dual numbers 0 is a number with that property.
[20:56:59] <riv> yes that's a good question
[20:57:26] <riv> if you just start with R and want a number in there that satisfies X^2 = 0, then 0 works

[20:57:31] <rex> Hey I'm a little confused about a graph statement: Every graph with 4 <= n vertices and at least 2n-3 edges contains a cycle with a chord
[20:57:48] <rex> Now in the proof they say that for n = 4 it's easy to see
[20:57:51] <riv> but building the dual numbers is done so that we add a genuinely new number that satisfies X^2 = 0
[20:58:15] <rex> however if take a look at the graph that looks like a cornered C and add the two diagonals where is the chord?
[20:58:22] <SJrX> If I define the U numbers as the set of numbers that are of the form a+bU where U=1, I can certainly define it, but that (from the little abstract algebra I did take), has to be isomorphic to the reals (which I think is a form of equivalence given a set and an operator (or two)) over it.
[20:58:32] <Decker> it's also like an epsilon that's not 0, but near 0....it's as close to 0 as you can be  as in (1/infinity) ^2 =0

[21:02:22] <SJrX> Decker, even the wikipedia defN doesn't have the constraint. But I guess if you define it without the constraint it seems isomorphic to the reals, if you define it with the constraint it seems like you should have to prove "something" about that value.

[21:06:14] <riv> rigorously what is being done is we start with R
[21:06:21] <riv> and then we build the polynomial ring R[X]
[21:06:25] <riv> then we quotient R[X]/(X^2)
[21:06:40] <riv> this is the same as building C = R[X]/(X^2 + 1)
[21:07:01] <riv> but (as you mentioned) X^2 already has solutions in R whereas X^2 + 1 doesn't
[21:07:03] <riv> this is OK though
[21:07:17] <SJrX> Yeah but the 1=1 case is being used to create a structure, this seems just arbitrarily tacked on and can lead to contradictions. Like if I have the first three axioms of probability and then add a fourth that says that any 10 disjoint sets have a probability measure of 1, you can add it, but it would make something inconsistent.
[21:07:26] <riv> we still end up with a 2D space over R, that is a ring (it has + and * operations)
[21:08:50] <Decker> SjrX it's another way to do a derivitive... it's also like 'dx' which isn't really a number at all
[21:09:08] <SJrX> Yup and polynomial rings was beyond my studies let alone quotient rings :)

[22:51:19] <int-e> snake: you messed up the division then, sorry
[22:51:23] <HisShadow> auk: also x/x is 1, so split it into 2 limits

[22:59:53] <auk> greenbagels, i get the sense it's as simple as a basic 1 = 1/1 = 1/1 logic? but i can't quite wrap my head around reasoning it out for sure
[23:00:27] <snake> int-e, can i use the quotient for finding if a PRZ adds up to zero? or do i have to use the full f(x)?
[23:00:48] <greenbagels> auk: consider the continuity of the 1/x function

[23:06:32] <int-e> auk: hard to say, it depends on how you think
[23:07:12] <int-e> What I wrote makes the uses of the limit of sin(z)/z (as z --> 0) explicit.
[23:07:22] <auk> int-e, right. I mean, that's easier for me, assuming I know about/remember the inverse limit rule
[23:08:15] <int-e> The intuitive way disposes of all that and directly replaces sin(ax)/sin(bx) by ax/(bx) = a/b, just as riv said.

[23:08:30] <riv> if lim f(x) = a and lim g(x) = b
