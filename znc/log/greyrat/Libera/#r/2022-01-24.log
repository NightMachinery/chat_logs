[20:06:34] <Bayes> am I getting that right? i.e., worrying about not picking the wrong algorithm > worrying about picking the best algorithm ?
[20:07:02] <confuzeus> oh, you are developing numerical algorithms for R? nice
[20:09:11] <Bayes> not really, I'm just reprocessing a large bunch of stuff and I was checking that I'm getting the same values I got before where that's expected

[21:29:04] <CuriousErnestBro> dont overthink Bayes just update ur beliefs

[21:30:22] <rickyrick> lel
[21:32:14] <Bayes> ok here's another tricky question (?)
[21:32:48] <Bayes> start with this: `mpg <- 21; subset(mtcars, mpg == force(mpg))`
[21:32:52] <Bayes> NO
[21:32:56] <Bayes> scratch that
[21:33:09] <Bayes> start with this: `mpg <- 21; subset(mtcars, mpg == mpg)`
[21:33:43] <Bayes> subset will expand the expression mgp == mgp with mtcars, which as a column named mgp
[21:34:20] <Bayes> can I tell R that I want to do mpg == the_mpg_variable_in_the_parent_env and not mpg == mpg which is just checking that the column is equal to itself?
[21:35:11] <CuriousErnestBro> just rename it
[21:35:36] <rickyrick> I guess mpg = get("mpg", parent_env())?
[21:35:36] <Bayes> well let's try to answer the question instead of walking around it
[21:35:44] <rickyrick> But ya just rename it
[21:35:54] <Bayes> data.table has this: ..(mpg) https://stackoverflow.com/a/21664128/2860744
[21:36:12] <Bayes> I was wondering if there's something similar in base R
[21:37:01] <rickyrick> Well subset(mtcars, mpg == get("mpg", globalenv())) works
[21:37:06] <rickyrick> But only because mpg is in the global env :^)
[21:37:15] <Bayes> yep that's what I was trying to evoid
[21:37:17] <Bayes> avoid*
[21:37:30] <rickyrick> I don't think there's a shorthand
[21:37:36] <Bayes> I was thinking of something like... "look in the parent env to this call" or something
[21:38:47] <Bayes> I was playing with force, but I couldn't force the expression to evaluate before the call
[21:40:12] <Bayes> this works too: f <- function(mpg) { subset(mtcars, mpg == get("mpg", 1)) }& f(21)
[21:40:33] <Bayes> er f <- function(mpg) { subset(mtcars, mpg == get("mpg", 1)) }; f(21)

[22:31:45] <rickyrick> IDK if you can subsample your time series
[22:31:50] <rickyrick> You'd definitely lose the high frequency info
[22:33:45] <confuzeus> since_: great. when i did statistical aspects of data mining the term deep learning had not yet been invented...
[22:34:51] <since_> rickyrick: as i understand it i need to use a window anyways, as i want to have the spectral entropy for a timestep of an audio signal
[22:35:24] <since_> And if i do a fft on the complete signal i loose the connection to the time, right?
[22:35:47] <rickyrick> You mean a running FFT
[22:35:58] <since_> ah subsample as in skip every second sample of the audio signal
[22:38:01] <rickyrick> ya
[22:38:10] <rickyrick> idk if that's valid though
[22:38:23] <since_> The thing i want to do is to control the speed of my video player so that i can watch lectures of Prof. Dr. Boring
[22:38:29] <rickyrick> wat
[22:39:01] <since_> and i started to use just signal entropy inside a window and have the player adjust the speed so that the entropy is constant
[22:39:09] <since_> (on the audio)
[22:39:29] <rickyrick> Here's an approximation
[22:39:31] <rickyrick> Just look at the bitrate
[22:39:32] <rickyrick> :^)
[22:40:07] <since_> I.e. audio sample 0x12 is frequent etc -> less entropy in this window
[22:40:21] <since_> This basically skips every silent parts of the video
[22:41:30] <since_> But when Prof. Boring says "Eeeehm" the entropy is high in the window as those loud samples 0xEE are seldom. Thus the player slows down for me to hear the "Eeeehm" and then speeds up again
