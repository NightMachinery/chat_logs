[04:58:47] <Viking667> technomancy: I'm not sure, I'd have to go check.
[04:59:20] <Viking667> I think the installer for neovim ships a few, though I didn't see smalltalk in the supported languages, come to think of it I don't think I saw lisp either.
[05:00:31] <technomancy> it'd be extremely weird to install a non-emacs text editor and get a lisp toolchain coming along for the ride
[05:01:48] <Viking667> true, but hey, you never know.
[05:02:40] <Viking667> although I suspect if they'd done so, they might have aimed at common lisp rather than elisp
[05:03:17] <technomancy> TBH with LSP's track record I wouldn't be surprised if they pulled a Han Unification move and just said "eh; all lisps are basically the same right??"

[05:05:16] <libfud> how do I get the lsp-ui window to hover in the correct buffer rather than a general frame location?
[05:05:40] <libfud> I'm going to guess that this involves writing a function to get buffer properties

[05:05:56] <libfud> and maybe there's a hook for it

[10:45:52] <libertyprime> right now it's being occluded even further by fine-tuning and prompt-tuning which will result in a lot of slavery as people will stop being able to write software

[21:10:49] <gnoo> that's just the unicode number. C-x 8 RET <unicode number or unicode name> RET. obiously name is more memorable than number

[21:12:03] <corwin> fwiw, the canonical abbreviations for keyboard modifier keys are a single character, C-x would be control + x, M-x for Mata(Alt)+x S == Super, and others I'm fretting.  besides being well recognized and consistent with the manual and other inline help, this is also shorter than <modifer>+<key>
[21:12:32] <corwin> s/fretting/forgetting ;; not ever sure how I did that.
