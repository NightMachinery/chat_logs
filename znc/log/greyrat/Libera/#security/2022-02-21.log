[02:05:02] <tomreyn> *somehow* none of the other vendors never made it to come up with solutions as 'light weight' as MS'. AV detection rate is lower, but not too much, and you better ensure the malware doesn't land there in the first place. and if it does, that you'll have good mechanisms to detect lateral movement and contain it, and can restore systems in a safe state quickly.
[02:07:30] <MadCamel> I'd throw on something that detects and prevents malware-like behaviors as well. Such as opening every file on a network share for write access. MS's antimalware is signature based not behavior based
[02:07:38] <MadCamel> and then yeah concentrate on other stuff

[02:22:49] <piou> at least as well as the others, generally better

[02:24:03] <riotz> what are those online threads youre speaking about?
[02:24:24] <riotz> the best protection is yourself
[02:24:35] <piou> And "ransomware prevention" -> that's called backup
[02:24:55] <riotz> dont download various stuff from the internet and execute it and think that there is some magic software thats going to protect you
[02:25:06] <riotz> there is nothing like that
[02:25:16] <piou> Not that there can't be smart strategies to help defend against ransomwares, but really backups should be 90% of your ransomware strategy
[02:25:49] <riotz> also be carefull with which urls you visit and where you enter your sensitive data to

[04:15:56] <CoJaBo> Random commercial gym. And, the staff member who let us in, apparently.
[04:16:27] <optimant> yikes
[04:16:55] <CoJaBo> We had some downtime (we usually have the stupidest issues installing wifi and/or copiers, so we left a lot of extra time, so of course Tor (the other tech I usually work with) has to show off, and the staff guy there is egging her on, and decides to be a jerk and screw with her by pinning the weight stack thing to the frame of the machine so it can't move. That turned out to be a bad idea.
[04:18:12] <CoJaBo> Remember Kids: If you have an unstoppable force meeting an unmovable object, you must also have an unbreakable cable.

[19:25:45] <lkthomas> wait, I am asking HTTPS
[19:25:50] <piou> lkthomas: three angles: block the DNS request that is generally not encrypted so the server can't be contacted, they can try to infer what domain a request is for by IP (the IP itself is needed and therefore not encrypted), and they can block the first request if this first request is made unencrypted (very common)
[19:25:57] <tesseract> they can't see which video you watched on youtube
[19:26:13] <lkthomas> I know Fortigate can block specific youtube channel
[19:26:15] <MeanEYE> So, they see DNS request which resolves domain.com -> x.x.x.x. And then nothing after that.

[19:26:42] <MeanEYE> Because TLS is layer above HTTP request. That is to say, TLS session is established then request is sent.

[20:28:24] <lkthomas> labrador, what's that quad 9 for ?
[20:28:32] <austincheney> i discovered this past summer that the cost to block VPN access from major media providers (Amazon, Netflix, and so on) is too high, so they don't do it.... except in one case.  Amazon Video has a sharing experience where two points on one account can watch the same movie simultaneously (a shared experience separated by distance)
[20:28:48] <labrador> lkthomas, dns
[20:28:52] <austincheney> in that case they are extremely aggressive about identifying and blocking all VPM access, likely for legal reasons
[20:28:59] <white2> labrador, u mean how to send info about the range of operation without a clear address/activity? (Server Name Indication)

[20:33:57] <labrador> white2, you need to verify the tls operator before getting to request stuff and the operator needs to know what you want in the first place before it presents its cert
[20:34:01] <MadCamel> if you want an easy workaround use a ssh tunnel to a vps. the people who run the networks use ssh daily so it's more likely the rulesets will allow it

[20:34:57] <piou> white2: the point of SNI is that the web server may expose multiple websites, using different domains. Since a certificate is related to a given domain, you need to know what domain is requested in order to provide the correct certificate, and later the correct website. This seems difficult to do without sending that domain before TLS is in effect

[20:42:29] <labrador> white2, so uh you're saying we make a tls connection without verifying identities basically?
[20:42:31] <labrador> That sucks
[20:42:34] <piou> providing the wrong cert is not "secure enough": you're not talking to who you think you are
[20:43:14] <piou> white2: what of hosting providers that manage thousands of websites on one server, each for someone different? You don't want someone to be able to "just" impersonnate the most popular one
