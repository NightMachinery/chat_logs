[18:56:15] <tbrowder> hi, i just used DateTime.clone for the first time and it wouldn't let me use ":$seconds", sounds like a bug to me
[18:57:31] <ugexe> isnt it :second?
[18:57:34] <tbrowder> m: my $t = DateTime.now; my $u = $t.clone(:seconds(0))
[18:57:34] <camelia> rakudo-moar 1891cd24a: ( no output )
[18:58:31] <tbrowder> supposedly, looking at the code, the plural form for most parts are acceptable
[18:59:25] <ugexe> quickly looking at the code i do not draw the same conclusion
[18:59:53] <tbrowder> hm, got to go but back later
[18:59:55] <ugexe> maybe thats what $valid-units does though
[19:00:10] <tbrowder> yes, that's what i see
[19:00:14] <tbrowder> bye

[19:32:08] <ugexe> yeah it looks like the clone method doesnt take any named parameters
[19:32:15] <ugexe> :year etc dont work either
[19:32:52] <ugexe> nm i read the code wrong, although :year isnt working
[19:38:05] <ugexe> oh jeez :year works fine, my example had a thinko
[19:39:09] <ugexe> :years doesnt work in clone though, so maybe method clone needs to integrate that $valid-units

[20:08:39] <ugexe> maybe... it might be that its not in the spirit of .clone to also handle those type of variations on input parameters and instead only affect actual attributes
[20:32:39] <tbrowder> well, i think that’s what the docs say: clone is used to modify attrs of a copy of an existing dt obj
[20:40:51] <ugexe> yeah but $!seconds isnt an attribute of DateTime
[20:41:09] <ugexe> its an alternative parameter name for a method yeah, but not an actual attribute
[20:41:48] <ugexe> so in that respect its probably not a bug

[21:08:06] <lizmat> hmmm
[21:09:08] <tbrowder> hm, i thought i had used plurals before, must be losing my mind
[21:13:48] <lizmat> it has the plurals for .later / .ealier
[21:13:52] <lizmat> *earlier
[21:14:13] <lizmat> allowing the plurals for DateTime.new, would make that a lot slower  :-(

[21:16:57] <tbrowder> gotcha, i just need to stop thinking plurals  guess, OR we could add plurals for all just for fun!
[21:17:00] <lizmat> atroxaper: that's how you note it for the weekly
[21:17:18] <lizmat> tbrowder: not if it would make DateTime.new 20% slower

[21:17:58] <lizmat> atroxaper: please do so, it will make it easier for me to do the weekly
[21:18:20] <tbrowder> oh, it would slow down the whole thing, not a good idea as you said
[21:18:28] <atroxaper> lizmat: deal.
[21:19:41] <tbrowder> but the positional approach is something i'll try, and i vaguely remember you mentioning that before...
[21:20:22] <ugexe> my guess was it would just be replacing e.g. :$seconds parameters with :second(:$seconds)
[21:20:41] <ugexe> or vice versa
[21:21:08] <ugexe> not that i agree it should be done

[21:39:03] <tbrowder> without beating a dead horse, why doesn't DateTime throw when using named plurals that aren't recognized?  (that sounds like a recent PR fix that may be in the next release)
[22:02:10] <ugexe> no methods do that
[22:02:17] <ugexe> only subroutines
[22:03:57] <lizmat> indeed, this is one of TimToady's decisions

[22:30:23] <Xliff> What's the best way to re-export symbols like exceptions or subs?
[22:33:02] <lizmat> create an EXPORT sub in the compunit that returns a Map with the name => what it is mapping
[22:37:12] <Xliff> But doesn't that need to be OUTSIDE the compunit definition?
[22:37:44] <Xliff> That means in the case of unit compunits it needs to be at the top of the file, which means a lot of predeclarations, yes?
[22:38:41] <Xliff> Also, this EXPORT sub needs to make sure the default mechanism still works, so how do you reuse the existing "is default" mechanism?
[22:38:50] <lizmat> sorry I wasn't clear
[22:38:59] <lizmat> it needs to be at the compunit level
[22:39:37] <lizmat> so if you indeed have a "unit module Foo" or "unit class Foo" it should be before it (can you actually do that)?
[22:40:24] <Xliff> Yes! That's what I am asking without the parenthetical!
