[05:05:25] <Jong> HuntsMan what motivated you to study so much on AI? It seems you've read a lot of books on it. These books take time to read.
[05:23:10] <HuntsMan> Jong: you assume I read books but that is not true ):
[05:23:12] <HuntsMan> :)
[05:23:38] <Jong> Is it that you find books inefficient for learning?
[05:26:45] *** Quits: Klinda (~superleag@user/klinda) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[05:27:59] <Jong> HuntsMan Has the thought ever crossed your mind that you're spending too much of your life studying and not enough of your life enjoying it doing other things like traveling, dating, walks on the beach, partying with friends, relaxing on the beach and enjoying the sound of the waves and more.  I ask because that's what I'm asking myself.  I'm afraid my life will be gone before my eyes and all I've done is work and study.
[05:28:01] <HuntsMan> no, they are outdated
[05:28:12] <HuntsMan> Jong: no, I travel a lot, well before the pandemic :P
[05:28:24] <HuntsMan> Jong: have you ever heard of papers?
[05:28:46] <Jong> Yes I know know about paper publications. I still like comprehensive books
[05:29:15] <HuntsMan> books come after papers, to get the state of the art, you read papers
[05:29:47] <Jong> HuntsMan if you travel a lot, doesn't that take time away from staying up to date in the field? or staying sharp generally in what you know?
[05:29:50] <HuntsMan> its literally my job to read papers
[05:30:05] <HuntsMan> Jong: heard of conferences? you do both travel and staying up to date
[05:30:45] <Jong> I'd need someone to travel with to go to a conference. I wouldn't want to go by myself. I'd feel very lonely even when surrounded by many others.
[05:32:24] <HuntsMan> try to find someone in your local community
[05:32:43] <Jong> HuntsMan  it sounds like you have it made. You get to travel and enjoy life and you also stay up to date in the field.
[05:33:48] <HuntsMan> that is why I am a Professor
[05:34:39] <HuntsMan> better said, I got offered such position
[05:55:00] <Jong> Congratulations

[21:22:49] <dostoyevsky2> theseb: deepmind does these things you probably couldn't try yourself, as you will never really have the hardware... nvidia does these things you might be able to use one day/soon on your own pc; openai seems to be inbetween
[21:23:46] <theseb> dostoyevsky2: openai did gpt-3...i think that requires ridiculous hardware too
[21:28:27] <dostoyevsky2> theseb: I read gpt3 could fit on like 6 nvidia h100, which has 80G ram each...
[21:32:47] <theseb> dostoyevsky2: hmm..that is big but not crazy big...thanks for the heads up
[21:33:24] <theseb> dostoyevsky2: wait...if it is that doable why haven't lots of other companies done a gpt-3 clone?
