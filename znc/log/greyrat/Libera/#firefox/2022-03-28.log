[00:25:23] <Caspy7[m]> ede: as I stated, OpenH264 is for WebRTC - it has nothing to do with playing normal videos on the web, including youtube
[00:26:00] <ede> but why does it install after opening the first yt video then?
[00:27:31] <Caspy7[m]> ede: maybe because they figure that if you're streaming video they know you're on a connection you care less about data use and it's a good time to download an extra library in the background
[00:29:22] <ede> i really don't have to care, but opening a youtube page doesn't necessarily mean i want to watch a 1080p video. actually i NEVER want to see videos in a browser, this just sucks.
[00:29:30] <ede> even more with all the crypto stuff.
[00:29:34] <Caspy7[m]> both the DRM and OpenH264 do not ship with Firefox's code because they are not technically FOSS. They download after the fact. Originally I recall they were going to have them download "on demand" but apparently the delay for some made for a bad experience. I thought they switched to "very soon after install" but maybe they switched to "during high data download" ðŸ¤· 
[00:29:52] <ede> firefox just could ask if i want this
[00:30:04] <Caspy7[m]> what sucks exactly?
[00:31:00] <ede> first of all mp4.js or what it may be is less effective than mpv. tested with local videos, also with some on the web available with no player around them (like that bunny thing).
[00:31:17] <ede> then it's the JS player used to play videos on most platforms.

[00:32:26] <Caspy7[m]> this has nothing to do with youtube's player at all, are you not listening?
[00:32:35] <ede> not to talk about ressource usage compared to a desktop player.
[00:33:07] <ede> talking about this, DRM. i tried to play some open streaming site in the past, it just brings down the system
[00:33:23] <ede> well, you were asking what sucks.
[00:33:53] <ede> and whenever i can (which means yt-dl(p) so mpv can be used) i avoid it.

[00:34:13] <Caspy7[m]> OpenH264 is used for WebRTC in the instance where you're doing a video chat with someone who can only receive H264 therefore you must encode video to H264, which is strictly non-FOSS, so that's where OpenH264 is required
[00:34:52] <ede> i'd run a 2nd specialized profile for such things like i did with fb a decade ago, but that's not possible anymore. i just don't have the ressources for today's web.

[00:36:42] <ede> thanks, no fb anymore for me. it's just the thing that it used to run in a 2nd instance including some fullscreen flash game. even twitter fills up my RAM over some time today.
[00:37:03] <Caspy7[m]> as I said, they did have it set to on-demand, but the delay in use was unacceptable - sites may even fail to work because of it

[00:38:23] <ede> sometimes i open fb links a user on another network posts. some of them are just for members only, but even if it redirects to the login i've seen that bar or bubble appearing telling me it needs something to play videos

[02:26:22] *** Joins: Guest86 (~Guest86@188.210.213.243)
[02:26:55] <superkuh> An html list of a directory is website based. But you could right click, view page info, "Media" if it's media you're after.
[02:27:49] <ede> multiple files still would have to be selected beforehand, it's no different from file managers.
[02:28:30] <quarter> would you like to take a look with me on the website?
[02:28:33] <superkuh> wget -r -l1 -A.jpg http://website.com/url/path/whatever.bork , if say, you wanted to download all the .jpg's.
[02:28:37] <ede> what about drive-by downloads? just like with firefox or what sourceforge introduced long ago
[02:28:42] <superkuh> But that's beyond firefox.
[02:29:53] <ede> the best method may be a drop zone managed by a script. like shell + yad.
[02:30:36] <quarter> I have no experience in this stuff tbh
[02:32:30] <ede> it's a puzzle for me too every time. starting with yad --dnd (or what it is), capturing its output, starting the download of all the files.
[02:32:44] <superkuh> There's probably some extension to download all files of a type or whatever.
[02:33:16] <quarter> it's a bit tricky with this website I believe
[02:33:28] <quarter> it's the coverproject with the category Nintendo64
[02:36:41] <ede> i suppose a download could be started by a script?
[02:36:46] *** Quits: xx (~xx@user/xx) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[02:37:57] <ede> if so, it surely should also work for multiple targets. without asking the user what to do with it sounds not really a good idea, but would just be it i think.
[02:42:26] <quarter> i came up with the same idea. the only problem is that the pictures are all over the place. on the other side a script with manual input of the links will take forever.
[02:43:27] <ede> depends on the usecase i guess. individual selection, predefined groups, something sql like.
[02:45:20] <ede> if you can't make up any structure then the dropzone looks ideal to me.
[02:45:39] <quarter> i was thinking of the whole category of n64. from there i can delete what I don't need. i have a huge collection at home where i need the printed covers for
[02:45:42] <quarter> dropzone?
[02:46:04] <ede> resize the browser to a good widht, fill the rest of the screen with the dialog, and you don't even have to look where you release the links
[02:46:20] <ede> one of the dialog types yad allows

[02:52:22] <ede> quarter: install yad, start it from a terminal with --dnd (and appropriate dimensions or resize it) and drag a few links into it. maybe it's a working model.
[02:56:12] <quarter>  alright
[02:56:24] <quarter> i have dragged some links into, what next?

[03:17:43] <ede> quarter: redirect the output to a file. then you can use the file to download all the links in it
[03:17:58] <ede> it's the cheapest version i'd say
[03:18:40] <ede> depending on the terminal yad may not even be necessary. i'm sure there are some supporting dropping.
