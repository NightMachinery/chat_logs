[14:27:59] <Lumine> Nice
[14:28:42] <brigand> how do you call the philosophy when you think "i create reality"?
[14:29:01] <Lumine> I don't have to use YT for Watts anymore, I collected all of his audioworks in the span of 4 years

[14:40:07] <Lumine> The problem with them being in YT is that they are mostly cut and edited from numerous different lectures and seminars without concise order, so you can't even have a specific lecture that you want if you know what you're looking for
[14:41:11] <Lumine> There is one channel though that has made the attempt to do just that, in putting them in the same order as the Electronic University has them listed and Watts's son
[14:41:42] <Lumine> But they're very stingy about them
[14:45:23] <Lumine> So instead of trying to fish for them there, I decided in 2017 to get my hands on everything and have them organized and uploaded into cloud
[14:48:50] <Lumine> So yeah anyway, I'm an avid Watts collector.

[15:00:43] <amigojapan> Lumine: and all of the solipsists except for me could still be philosophical zombies, that does not seem like a good reason to consider it false
[15:00:50] <amigojapan> anyway, I live as if it is false
[15:00:56] <Lumine> So do I
[15:01:24] <Lumine> It might not a be a good reason but is hilarious
[15:01:33] <amigojapan> even if it is true, living in a way that treats other people as if they are not real, would just make your life bad, you owuld end up in a looney bin
[15:01:51] <amigojapan> oh yes, it is funny
[15:02:25] <amigojapan> there can only be one single solipsists if it is real, and it would need to be me'
[15:03:04] *** Joins: lakitu (~lakitu@192-198-3-9.dhcp.radiolinkinternet.com)
[15:03:13] <Lumine> Yeah, and if everyone has to be the sole solipsist, it's obvious that none of them are.
[15:03:18] <brigand> maybe you're all just bots to entertain and distract me
[15:03:24] <brigand> :p
[15:05:14] <amigojapan> Lumine: on the other hand, if the idea of brahma dreamming reality into existance and we are all part of his dream is real, then brahma is the solipsists, and us people are not realli  philosophical zombies
[15:05:25] <amigojapan> at least not to each other
[15:05:39] <Lumine> amigojapan: yeah
[15:06:59] <amigojapan> Hindu religion can be interesting
[15:08:23] <Lumine> There's a reason why I'm not fully Hindu philosophically though, related to their core esoteric teachings of Maya, Brahman and Lila.
[15:09:04] <amigojapan> Maya is the God that decides if you go to hell  or heaven right?
[15:09:20] <Lumine> No, i'm referring to something else
[15:09:25] <amigojapan> ah ok
[15:09:45] <brigand> "reality is just a simulation" similar bs
[15:10:11] <brigand> bs is too strong of a word. i apologise
[15:17:37] <amigojapan> brigand: I dont think anyone said that just now
[15:18:02] <brigand> "brahma dreamming reality into existance" is similar
[15:18:36] <Lumine> There's two attitudes to someone suggesting that everything is an "illusion". Either you take the stance that it means putting something down, because you invested in something so much that it seems to suggest undermining it. The other, is a sigh of relief. Which is much more difficult to explain. It ventures into mysticism and the idea that since everything is an illusion, suggests security in a way. But people often take the
[15:18:36] <Lumine> misinterpreation and run with it, saying that they can do whatever they like, BECAUSE it's just an illusion.
[15:19:39] <brigand> the 3rd stance is to shrug it off
[15:19:44] <Lumine> That too
[15:21:05] <Lumine> Personally I don't care anymore, whether it is or not
[15:22:40] <Lumine> Because I just try to live in a way that minimizes the bad stuff
[15:22:50] <brigand> yep

[15:28:18] <Lumine> So to me solipsism seems to be an extreme form of neglectance. Of other people.
[15:29:46] <Lumine> And that is also the reason why I don't take the "everything is a simulation" to heart.
[15:30:29] <Lumine> Because the moment I throw everything in the wind, is the moment I become a danger to others and myself.

[15:57:19] <arryana> i don't think solipsism appeals to people as creative as you are, lumine
[15:59:06] <arryana> in my experience it's the wish for importance without having earned it.

[16:31:23] <pussipupu> The simulation hypothesis seems to me plausible but irrelevant
[16:32:33] <pussipupu> If the world I experience is a simulation and so am I, I still know I'm a person and have every reason to believe others are persons, so it doesn't change anything functionally
[16:33:35] <arryana> i was never a fan of simulation theory, plus i had a physicist friend of mine explain how the power demands just don't work
[16:37:49] <Lumine> To me the whole simulation theory just makes us feel even more alieanated from the rest of it. I'm a big fan of what I would call nature-aware thinking.
[16:38:00] <arryana> yeah
[16:44:22] <assan> simulation is something the mayans spoke about, its something to let us know this world is fake and the aim is to get back to the real world, that we have be locked in a computer game, like this mind uploading issue in this case we are already uploaded and the place we uploaded to is the earth

[16:47:17] <arryana> for me it isn't an issue of alienation, it's that it's a pointless argument even if it's true

[16:47:41] <arryana> what we experience is still our version of the world, and denying it as a reality is just escapism and wishful thinking.
[16:48:04] <Lumine> I agree
[16:48:13] <arryana> still, my physicist friend is right, and the energy demands of unreal-reality don't make sense
[16:48:58] <assan> yeah cuz your physicist don't know alot of stuff
