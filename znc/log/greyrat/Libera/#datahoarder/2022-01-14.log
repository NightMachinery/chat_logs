[01:34:27] <evilgohan2> Wonder what might be the cause of that
[01:34:49] <Fiji> if you read more than the headline you'd see it's just the continuation of a downward trend since 2015
[01:34:49] <sarnold> probably completely unrelated to the soaring cost
[01:34:54] <sarnold> or high interest rates

[01:35:08] <evilgohan2> It's pretty much the same story
[01:35:15] <evilgohan2> Increasing tuition costs, poor wages, and people need money.
[01:35:26] <Fiji> thought you were implying covid lol
[01:35:34] <evilgohan2> oh. No. I mean, it's a factor, but no.

[23:00:59] <ThePendulum> well that didn't age well https://i.redd.it/c3iv8cgtrnb81.jpg
[23:09:32] <skye0> Aged like plutonium
[23:10:06] <skye0> Oh, not plutonium, its half life is too fucking long
[23:10:23] <skye0> What goes off quicker than milk when not stored properly?
[23:11:06] <rmmh> fish
[23:11:21] <skye0> Cool, thanks
[23:12:29] <skye0> And I'm still angry with The White Rose. They're bullies at this point. Imagine them telling a Muslim woman to remove her niqab just because "le CoViD is a myth" even though she's OK with wearing one and even when she's triple vaccinated and outdoors in a good day
[23:12:59] <skye0> Their whole shtick about "masks=muzzles" is bullshit
[23:14:33] <skye0> I'm secretly wishing we were in another world war instead of this pandemic just because it's easier to see what can kill us, and less bullshit about it will circulate.
