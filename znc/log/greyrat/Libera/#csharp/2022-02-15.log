[00:00:13] <pitfall> I've been pretty burned out myself
[00:00:22] <pitfall> absolutely hated being on Azure
[00:00:36] <Suchiman> dang, so the codespaces thing didn't work out huh?
[00:01:02] <pitfall> moved to a VS subteam and things are better, but I'm still not as enthusiastic about coding as I used to be
[00:01:14] <Suchiman> yeah
[00:01:17] <pitfall> well, I got moved off codespaces after 5 months to DevTest Labs
[00:01:23] <lz_> Suchiman: funny thing is, people usually don't want to hear it when things aren't going well. I wish "how are you" was a real question we could answer without filters
[00:01:27] <pitfall> Codespaces was at least a kinda-cool product
[00:01:45] <JakeSays> ki9a: dogs are low maintenance
[00:01:47] <pitfall> DTL was just ... Enterprise. and boring.
[00:02:23] <ki9a> hmm
[00:02:32] <Suchiman> brianonymous: anyway, it's certainly not an impulse decision, been thinking about it for years, certainly are high effort pets and that kind of malbehavior is to also owner's fault :P
[00:02:37] <ki9a> when I ask how are you I usually want to know how someone is
[00:02:43] <ki9a> else I won't ask

[00:03:15] <ki9a> see
[00:03:18] <brianonymous> Suchiman: well, in the flying dinosaur case, i think they are just like that
[00:03:20] <Suchiman> lz_: yeah although it's also a bit of a cultural thing, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqxnrF8Zk-c
[00:03:24] <brianonymous> dogs, yes
[00:03:49] <pitfall> brianonymous I gotta figure out how to do this for MimeKit :) https://lemire.me/blog/2018/01/17/ridiculously-fast-base64-encoding-and-decoding/

[00:04:39] <lz_> Suchiman: well I think it's a good thing, I wish we it was the same here
[00:04:53] <ki9a> nah it's a bit of a cultural thing to presume "how are you" has no meaning
[00:04:54] <brianonymous> pitfall: sounds like fun :)

[00:05:18] <ki9a> AKA MSAccess online
[00:05:20] <Suchiman> pitfall: hey btw. didn't .NET Core improve a lot in the direction of finding stuff (IndexOf) and Base64 encoding stuff, vectorization and all that fancy stuff
[00:05:29] <ki9a> but for insane pricing
[00:05:39] <JakeSays> ki9a: lol dude did you or did you not ask me that?

[00:06:06] <JakeSays> ok.

[00:10:17] <ki9a> I had my booster. Seems to have had some effect.
[00:10:57] <JakeSays> ki9a: i don't use "how are you" as hello.
[00:11:27] <ki9a> never said you did :) But some people do
[00:11:34] <JakeSays> i know. just sayin'
[00:11:56] <JakeSays> my point was that i agree with you.
[00:12:06] <ki9a> Did I mention I dislike Azure
[00:12:12] <ki9a> Not saying gcp or aws is better
[00:12:21] <JakeSays> heh. we agree there as well

[13:00:50] <Nasp> I wonder if there's a way to check routes in startup if they are valid in AspNetCore
[13:00:57] <Nasp> Instead of first noticing when hitting the contrller
[13:03:46] <MatthiasVance> MaNa2k: Show more context! What warning/error are you getting etc..
[13:03:50] <MatthiasVance> Screenshot of VS helps
[13:04:21] <Nasp> Or paste the code
[13:09:37] <MaNa2k> that the config isnt assigned
[13:09:46] <MaNa2k> its an interface, not sure it has to be assigned.
[13:09:49] <MaNa2k> the code worked oki
[13:10:37] <MatthiasVance> MaNa2k: What you're saying makes no sense
[13:12:01] <MaNa2k> oh it deffinitly works, its just vs giving warning. oki, fine, ill paste the whole code, just a second
[13:12:31] <MatthiasVance> Aren't you setting it in the Startup constructor?

[13:25:54] <Nasp> MatthiasVance: Just broke 5 controllers due to routing
[13:31:25] <MatthiasVance> :D
[13:38:20] <khanred> Why am I still awake
[13:45:34] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  I can't figure out if controllers always need HttpGet Put post and so on
[13:45:45] <Nasp> They didn't use to, of it that's one of the changes when using attribute routing
[13:46:46] <MatthiasVance> Yes at least [Http*Verb*] is needed for an action

[13:46:51] *** Joins: edcba (~edcba@user/edcba)
[13:47:05] <MatthiasVance> but not a full route or action name, just that
[13:47:20] <MatthiasVance> Because the controller can have [Route("[controller]/[action]")]
[13:47:24] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: ^
[13:47:27] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  But we slap [HttpGet] on everythong
[13:47:43] <Nasp> Even with [HttpGet("DoStuff"] public ACtionResult DoStuff()
[13:47:52] <Nasp> The controller/action is frowned upon i think
[13:47:55] <MatthiasVance> I think you can globally inject those attributes for every action
[13:47:56] <Nasp> Atleast the controller part
[13:48:09] <MatthiasVance> Frowned upon by who? That is the template default
[13:48:09] <Nasp> But meh i'd prefer my route file
[13:48:26] <Nasp> AspNetcore complains about [Controller] in route
[13:48:29] <Nasp> You should use the name instead
[13:48:34] <MatthiasVance> no no no
[13:48:51] <Nasp> I'd be much easier to see the hierachy through a route file
[13:48:56] <MatthiasVance> Yes agreed
[13:49:11] <MatthiasVance> Well
[13:49:22] <MatthiasVance> Why actually? :D
[13:49:32] <Nasp> When you have 300 routes it is
[13:49:36] <Nasp> Instead of looking in 300 controllers
[13:49:52] <Nasp> Or 450 routes really i think
[13:49:53] <MatthiasVance> So you mean for bulk things like refactoring
[13:50:16] <Nasp> Just easier to make sure people dont mess up when two people use the same route for a controller
[13:50:34] <Nasp> Would be quite clear when it's in the same file
[13:51:32] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Yeah, with the downside of nested routes
[13:51:40] <MatthiasVance> Like "this always starts with /customer"
[13:53:36] <Nasp> Yeah
[13:53:53] <Nasp> Also these controllers are scattered all over the place
[13:53:59] <Nasp> No structure really
[13:54:11] <Nasp> But yeah if i could just get something to validate routes on startup
[13:54:21] <Nasp> I considered makign a test to ensure everything has HttpVerbs on actions

[13:57:41] <Nasp> I just had to make my own route constraint due to two different actions having the same route, and the only difference was the query parameter
[13:57:49] <Nasp> There's no built in mechanism for that

[23:25:23] <MatthiasVance> Bought it for 340k, borrowed 357k, put in .. 20k outselves.. worth 485k now, putting in another 140k and it will be worth 575k
[23:25:41] <JakeSays> that's a lot of k's!
[23:25:57] <ki9a> yeah
[23:25:58] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Haha this PLA needs 195-215 so I tried a few things, the "pressure advance tuning" feature of Klipper says to print it at 75% your nozzle width
[23:26:09] <ki9a> my current house was sold thursday (official now)
[23:26:15] <MatthiasVance> Neat! Congrats!
[23:26:16] <ki9a> for next year
[23:26:25] <MatthiasVance> Probably at a nice premium?
[23:26:33] <MatthiasVance> Given how the housing market is doing
[23:26:39] <JakeSays> the last house i bought i paid $135k for 2,800 square feet. ugh.
[23:26:43] <ki9a> It sold well
[23:27:02] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: That's .. super cheap compared to here
[23:27:05] <ki9a> I'm quite happy
[23:27:19] <MatthiasVance> 2800 sq ft = 260 m2
[23:27:28] <ki9a> We're looking into ordering a kitchen and bathroom now
[23:27:34] <ki9a> 2800sq house or ground?
[23:27:40] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: that was in 1997
[23:27:46] <JakeSays> ki9a: house
[23:27:49] <ki9a> ah nice
[23:28:18] <ki9a> my (new) house is ~160 m2 I guess
[23:28:21] <ki9a> 260 is huge
[23:28:44] <ki9a> do you count the attic too?
[23:28:49] <JakeSays> no
[23:28:59] <ki9a> then that's it
[23:29:11] <ki9a> ground is 330sqm
[23:29:22] <JakeSays> whats it?
[23:29:45] <ki9a> the total square meters of the land
[23:29:50] <ki9a> NL isn't big
[23:29:55] <ki9a> plots are small
[23:29:56] <MatthiasVance> That's nice to have in NL
[23:30:05] <JakeSays> ah
[23:30:06] <MatthiasVance> I think we have around the same here
[23:30:16] <MatthiasVance> But only because we don't live in a city
[23:30:22] <JakeSays> it was 2 story with a full basement
[23:30:28] <MatthiasVance> I would love a basement
[23:30:43] <MatthiasVance> And / or full garage
[23:30:46] <MatthiasVance> Fuckers tore down half of it
[23:30:54] <JakeSays> had that too
[23:31:28] <JakeSays> i want to build another one, but i'll easily spend 4-5x as much for it now
[23:31:43] <JakeSays> which frankly is not a pleasant thought
[23:31:49] <MatthiasVance> Yeah that's the issue right now .. materials and cost of labor
[23:32:32] <ki9a> I think a basement will go for like 100-150k here
[23:32:37] <ki9a> to build under an existing house
[23:32:39] <ki9a> so I'll pass
[23:32:56] <MatthiasVance> That depends on how much it sells for later, right
[23:33:01] <JakeSays> if i move back to montana i can have my brother build it for much less
[23:33:07] <ki9a> no I mean
[23:33:10] <ki9a> it costs to build
[23:33:13] <MatthiasVance> Yes
[23:33:27] <ki9a> you need a permit
[23:33:27] <JakeSays> ki9a: under an existing house? yeah that would be pricey
[23:33:38] <ki9a> among other things
[23:33:53] <MatthiasVance> I'm getting rid of our wooden floor in one part, concrete everywhere!
[23:33:59] <MatthiasVance> No crawlspace anymore, yay
[23:34:13] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: concrete? why?
[23:34:16] <ki9a> how isthat yay?
[23:34:20] <JakeSays> ^
[23:34:21] <ki9a> (the crawlspace)
[23:34:24] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: That's how we build houses here? :P
[23:34:25] <ki9a> I agree with wood
[23:34:43] <JakeSays> yeah i'd take wood over rock for a floor
[23:35:00] <MatthiasVance> Oh wait not the actual top floor
[23:35:48] <ki9a> I prefer concrete floors
[23:35:50] <ki9a> less noise
[23:35:54] <ki9a> more heat proff
[23:36:09] <JakeSays> not me. i love wood floors.
[23:36:28] <JakeSays> i have concrete under carpet here. it sucks
[23:36:28] <MatthiasVance> I didn't want to have a crawl space.. one more thing to have accessible. So dumping that full with sand and then a layer of concrete
[23:36:38] <MatthiasVance> But that doesn't mean you can't still have a wooden floor with concrete
[23:37:00] <MatthiasVance> That's usually how it's done, you start with concrete, add some insulation and then lay a wooden floor on top
[23:37:02] *** Quits: alguien (~alguien@user/alguien) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:37:10] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: ah i see. makes sense
[23:37:17] <JakeSays> that's how this place is
[23:37:48] <MatthiasVance> And if I want floor heating I need insulation and you can't do that with a wooden floor because it'll rot
[23:38:06] <ki9a> ah yeah
[23:38:11] <JakeSays> but crawl spaces are handy for running wires, etc.
[23:38:11] <ki9a> we're going for PVC
[23:38:22] <ki9a> floor (on top of water heated concrete)
[23:38:28] <ki9a> JakeSays: indeed.
[23:38:36] <MatthiasVance> PVC here too
[23:38:49] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: I'll make sure they have 1 or 2 wiring thingies and renewed water pipes
[23:38:50] *** Joins: alguien (~alguien@user/alguien)
[23:38:57] <MatthiasVance> There isn't a lot under the floor anyway
[23:39:13] <MatthiasVance> 1 set of radiator pipes that will be gone, 2 water pipes and 1 ethernet cable xD
[23:39:17] <JakeSays> i mean for future wiring, etc
[23:39:34] *** Joins: Autowired (~autowired@dslb-094-218-237-093.094.218.pools.vodafone-ip.de)
[23:39:41] <MatthiasVance> Not needed under the floor, can just run through the sides?
[23:39:59] <JakeSays> sure, but it's muuuuch harder to do
[23:40:15] <MatthiasVance> For downstairs I don't need any wiring tbh
[23:40:32] <JakeSays> i put a suspended ceiling in my basement. it was damn handy
[23:40:35] <MatthiasVance> The only thing is I have a column that goes up somewhere in the back and the ethernet comes from the front
[23:40:51] <MatthiasVance> They'll figure it out
[23:42:07] <JakeSays> for me a house is a living thing, so to speak. i love being able to modify it at will, adding new things, etc.
[23:42:15] <JakeSays> so the more accessible the better
[23:42:44] <ki9a> My current house has the same structure above as below floors
[23:42:54] <ki9a> ie the foundational walls are in the crawlspace too
[23:43:05] <ki9a> with 1 block missing
[23:43:23] <ki9a> it's really tight to crawl through
[23:43:35] *** Quits: xb0o2 (~xb0o2@user/xb0o2) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:43:56] <JakeSays> i want my next house to be a U shaped ranch.
[23:43:59] <ki9a> the new one will have it completely clear
[23:44:16] <ki9a> ie if you were to dig it out you'd have another huge room
[23:45:48] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Oh I feel the same way about modifying, however I never ever see a need to go under the floor. Might be because of the layout though
[23:46:09] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: All the electricity and water is at the sides so can easily expand or move that if needed
[23:46:54] <JakeSays> well, i never see a need in the beginning either, but i always end up using it
[23:48:21] <ki9a> yep
[23:51:54] <JakeSays> when you want to rearrange furniture and need an outlet in a weird spot, you just add one through the floor.

[23:58:29] <ki9a> well rearranging sockets is simple enough
[23:58:38] <ki9a> just cut them through the wall and reapply the plaster
[23:58:47] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Ahh I'd always do that through the wall like ki9a mentioned
[23:58:57] <MatthiasVance> That's the normal way here :D
[23:59:05] <JakeSays> then you end up running extension cords everywhere
[23:59:10] <MatthiasVance> Hm, no?
[23:59:12] <ki9a> extension cords?

[23:59:26] <MatthiasVance> Ah you said "in a weird spot"
[23:59:33] <MatthiasVance> So.. middle of the room for example
[23:59:35] *** Joins: kobo_ (~kobo___@c-d02b225c.029-1613-6f72651.bbcust.telenor.se)
[23:59:37] <JakeSays> yes. if you want, say, a lamp 10 feet from a wall, you need cords
[23:59:38] <ki9a> make sure every wall has a socket
[23:59:42] <ki9a> oh
