[00:03:42] <fakuve> Hi guys , yet another day cracking on with php , what adventures we are gonna have today? :D . Ok so , what is `$this` variable like that , is not a reserved word of some sort but it has an special functionality
[00:05:05] <Byteflux> fakuve: https://php.net/oop5.basic
[00:05:27] <tsukasadt> AllenJB, thanks for the info earlier about session locking. I've since confirmed that is the problem and am racking my brain on how to rewrite the entire system with as little effort as possible. xD
[00:05:42] <fakuve> Byteflux: cheers
[00:06:25] <titus123> ok, going to check out the TIMESTAMP
[00:07:35] *** Joins: gamara (~gamara@66-203-186-206.ded.execulink.com)
[00:08:26] <Byteflux> titus123: Note that TIMESTAMP is about ensuring that date/times are *stored* as UTC. This means that selecting from a TIMESTAMP column still converts from UTC to whatever timezone your client session is configured with.
[00:09:14] *** Joins: puff (~user@S0106d4ca6d80a83c.vs.shawcable.net)
[00:10:03] <Byteflux> Or the system time, as that would be the default if no client timezone is explicitly configured.
[00:10:21] <gamara> Hey I am trying to run phpunit tests on my objects but I am getting a requires error. https://pastebin.com/0PY9kB1a Here is my directory setup https://i.imgur.com/FuJVgIa.png
[00:12:28] <Byteflux> gamara: If you're using Composer, you shouldn't have `require` or `require_once` anywhere (except in one special place) in your source files or test files.
[00:12:41] <Byteflux> You should have configured your autoloader in compose.json
[00:13:03] <Byteflux> And then you should have told phpunit to use that autoloader in phpunit.xml or phpunit.xml.dist
[00:13:36] <gamara> Byteflux so I should let composer take care of importing of even local files?
[00:13:50] <gamara> im new to php so I dont really get the build structure I should use
[00:13:57] <Byteflux> Absolutely, Composer should handle importing everything.
[00:14:15] <Byteflux> The only place you need a `require` is your application's entry point file.
[00:14:16] <gamara> I thought composer was only for library imports
[00:14:51] <Sammitch> it is also a fully-featured autoloader
[00:15:40] <gamara> I honestly kind of hate composer it is such a nightmare to install
[00:15:50] <Byteflux> ^ it is capable of autoloading files from anywhere and supports the two most popular file/class naming structures (PSR-0 and PSR-4)
[00:16:01] <Sammitch> https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#autoloading
[00:16:16] <Byteflux> Most libraries are using PSR-4 style autoloading and that is what you should use too
[00:16:26] <stenno> wait composer is super easy to install
[00:17:05] <Byteflux> Composer is quite literally a 1 line curl/wget on Linux/macOS and a simple installer on Windows.
[00:17:11] <Byteflux> Don't think it can be any easier.
[00:17:20] <gamara> maybe I am following a bad guide
[00:17:30] <stenno> https://getcomposer.org/download/
[00:17:35] <stenno> ^ the guide
[00:18:15] <stenno> note the installer options, i usually use the first three whenever i install it
[00:18:27] <stenno> --install-dir, --filename and --version
[00:20:05] <Byteflux> I just `wget https://getcomposer.org/download/latest-stable/composer.phar -O /usr/local/bin/composer && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/composer`
[00:20:06] <titus123> Byteflux: I see that by changing the DATETIME to TIMESTAMP yielded exacly the same time, so it seems all is set to UTC.  Lets say I change the appraoch with this example I found: $date = date('Y-m-d H:i:s'); mysql_query("INSERT INTO `table` (`dateposted`) VALUES ('$date')");  .... what type of mysql field should I set up to receive this?  Should it be a string, or which options of the date types
[00:20:07] <titus123> should I use?
[00:21:46] <gamara> I keep getting errors with composer idk why it wont cleanly install
[00:22:43] <freeman_h> hi all I am on a shared hosting server the default php version is 7.0 however my site is running 7.4 the support has put me to run php 7.4 when i run phpinfo() php version is 7.4 which if fine. however some of my php 7.2+ methods and library are saying i am running php 7.0
[00:22:46] <Byteflux> titus123: TIMESTAMP is still the right type to be using because it ensures that the date is being stored as UTC, you just need to make sure that you're getting the date back in the right timezone when you read from the column.
[00:23:04] <freeman_h> any ideas what is missing in the config?
[00:23:27] <gamara> https://i.imgur.com/jmHHdTE.png
[00:23:48] <Byteflux> titus123: When you generate a date in PHP, that date is using the timezone configured in PHP. But when you insert that date into a MySQL TIMESTAMP column, then MySQL is converting that date from *its* system timezone to UTC.
[00:24:38] <Sammitch> freeman_h: I would wager that your host has the _web server_ calling 7.4 but you're calling out to the shell/CLI which is still using 7.0
[00:24:39] <Byteflux> So if your PHP timezone and MySQL timezone are different, that's an issue. You want MySQL to be using the same timezone as your PHP timezone, that way it converts to the correct UTC date/time.
[00:25:16] <Byteflux> titus123: You can change your MySQL connection's timezone with a query like `SET time_zone = ...`
[00:26:07] <freeman_h> Sammitch, good point will let them know to chect
[00:26:09] <freeman_h> check*
[00:27:59] <Sammitch> freeman_h: while it's possible that they have updated CLI binaries you can use, if you're calling back out to the shell to run more PHP I would consider that a powerful code smell
[00:28:38] <Byteflux> titus123: Alternatively you can do like __adrian was saying and just store a UNIX timestamp instead. This means no conversions happening in the database at all. You just need to make sure that you are inserting UNIX timestamps
[00:28:41] <titus123> Byteflux: but if I change my time_zone then this is also creating issues?  So you suggest to leave the timezone as it is probably UTC and simply convert the time back into my local time through PHP when I dispaly it?  If I am understanding correctly?
[00:30:19] <Byteflux> titus123: When you establish a connection to MySQL, your connection has a timezone associated with it. Usually this will default to the timezone of the system where MySQL is running.
[00:30:50] <titus123> ok, UNIX would be consistent too it seems... I can look for a way to convert UNIX to a local time... damn... I just want to store the time that the form was submitted and be able to display it back... this all becomes quite complicated.
[00:30:55] <Byteflux> titus123: This connection-specific timezone is how MySQL determines the timezone to convert a TIMESTAMP to/from UTC.
[00:31:22] <titus123> seems it might take a week of study just to understand time and date managment
[00:31:24] <Byteflux> The connection timezone can be changed
[00:31:52] <gamara> thanks for your help guys finally got composer working
[00:32:52] <stenno> wait
[00:32:55] <stenno> lol
[00:33:03] <stenno> you meant `composer install` and not installing composer
[00:33:04] <Byteflux> A UNIX timestamp is consistent as long as both your MySQL system time and PHP system times are correctly configured, regardless of their timezones.
[00:33:50] *** Quits: muley (~muley@76-245-68-99.lightspeed.iplsin.sbcglobal.net) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[00:34:10] <Byteflux> A TIMESTAMP column is consistent as long as both MySQL and PHP system times are correctly configured, *but also* your MySQL *connection's* time zone needs to be correct too. In your case, it sounds like because you are generating a datetime from PHP, that datetime is going to be based off of the PHP system timezone.
[00:34:21] <titus123> byteflux: do you have an example of what you would use?  My goal is simple.  The staff just need to know what time the form was filled in on the website.
[00:35:07] <Byteflux> MySQL is trying to do for you automatically what you would have to do yourself if you used a UNIX timestamp, that's the only difference.
[00:35:16] <Byteflux> (when using a TIMESTAMP)
[00:35:43] <Byteflux> Honestly if this is all too confusing for you, just use a UNIX timestamp.
[00:35:53] <Byteflux> You'd need to store it as an INT(11) I think?
[00:37:58] <Byteflux> `UNSIGNED INT` should do it. PHP and MySQL can both generate UNIX timestamps. Both can format as UNIX timestamp as a date, too.
[00:38:22] <stenno> y2k38 avoided with the unsigned!
[00:38:33] <Byteflux> So your only concern would be that you display the timestamp in your preferred timezone
[00:38:59] <Byteflux> It's always going to be the "correct time" regardless of where the timestamp comes from as long as the system that creates that timestamp has the correct time set.
[00:41:18] <titus123> Byteflux: ok thanks... I am going to persue this apporach with the UNIX time with the INT field... I will google arround a bit with these and see what examples I find for this conversions.  Thanks
[00:42:57] <biberu> Byteflux: re INT(11), 11 is the display width, it doesn't affect the range of values it can hold
[00:43:09] <Byteflux> titus123: PHP can generate a UNIX timestamp with `time()` and format one with `date()` (or using DateTime::setTimestamp()). MySQL can create a timestamp with `UNIX_TIMESTAMP()` and format one with `FROM_UNIXTIME()`
[00:43:43] <Byteflux> biberu: Yeah I just remembered that, common misunderstanding especially with VARCHAR :P
[00:44:13] <biberu> yeah :)
[00:45:05] <fakuve> so basically , in php we got `member variables` a.k.a. `properties` in other programming languages , and `member functions` a.k.a `methods` in other programming languages
[00:45:19] *** Joins: muley (~muley@76-245-68-99.lightspeed.iplsin.sbcglobal.net)
[00:45:26] <__adrian> fakuve: we just call them properties and methods
[00:45:58] <titus123> ok great... will try those functions
[00:46:01] <fakuve> oks , I'm seen in some manuals and even some people in stack overflow refering to them as that , and I was a bit confused
[00:47:46] <Byteflux> titus123: Unix timestamps are incredibly simple. Once you learn what they are, manipulating them is trivial too. It's just the # of seconds elapsed since the Unix epoch (Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00). So adding or substracting time is easy since you know 60 seconds = 1 minute, 60 minutes = 1 hour etc.
[00:48:13] <__adrian> you're forgetting -
[00:48:16] <__adrian> LEAP SECONDS
[00:48:42] <stenno> biberu: where is that behavior with the INT(n) documented?
[00:48:57] <stenno> https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/integer-types.html doesn't mention it
[00:49:33] <stenno> i guess its documented for BIT(m)
[00:49:48] <Byteflux> stenno: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/numeric-type-attributes.html
[00:49:56] <stenno> thx
[00:50:12] <__adrian> it's display, not anything intrinsic to the datatype itself
[00:51:00] <stenno> yeah, just wanted to check on the specific behavior
[00:53:08] <stenno> so the use cases for INT(m) are really specific then lol

[05:39:20] <lind{at}yahoo> anyone here a drupal architect thats not in #drupal?
[05:41:12] <Rockwood> means?
[05:41:31] <Rockwood> they don't have details about it?
[05:42:07] <lind{at}yahoo> hey Rockwood, its Odyss3us/Crusher. Only 34 people in there, no answers to my question so far
[05:42:31] <lind{at}yahoo> so I have a solutions architecture interview case study and the underlying tech is drupal which I know pretty much nothing about, the project is very abstract: drupal portal, iOS side by side client bound by custom REST services. They are just looking for diagrams and a write up but I really need a strong, high level, guide to the architecture and capabilities of Drupal.
[05:43:01] <lind{at}yahoo> Ideally I would like to design it such that Drupal powers the layout and data bindings of the iOS client, I've done similar projects in the past with Microsoft Reporting Services and WPF
[05:43:33] <Rockwood> lind{at}yahoo, i can't help you bcz me too jobless :( and don't much about drupal too
[05:43:58] <lind{at}yahoo> sorry to hear that Rockwood, how you been?
[05:44:56] <stenno> !+jobs
[05:44:56] <php-bot> No job posting or asking for jobs on ##php, please (see /msg php-bot g6). You may want to check out http://freelancer.com/ or http://toptal.com or https://upwork.com (##PHP does not affiliate with any of these channels/sites).
[05:45:07] <Blondie101010> don't think that's it
[05:45:13] <Blondie101010> but still not on topic
[05:45:27] <stenno> oh yeah i was too quick
[05:45:41] <__adrian> #drupal is the right place - if anyone wants to answer drupal questions, that's where they go
[05:45:52] <stenno> its way too late for me and i should not attempt to give any kind of support or similar lmao
[05:45:54] <__adrian> but i'll also suggest that what you're asking is a little heavy for irc at all
[05:46:10] <__adrian> especially if there's a time crunch
[05:46:19] <Blondie101010> my take on this is that you should not expect to pass an interview on something you don't know
[05:46:21] <Rockwood> __adrian, he is facing no response from there
[05:46:32] <__adrian> spend the time reading drupal's docs. apply what you know from other languages/projects.
[05:46:45] <__adrian> Rockwood: that's not relevant
[05:46:57] <Rockwood> still devs drupal is using?
[05:47:07] <__adrian> drupal is still used, yes
[05:47:22] <__adrian> it won't be going anywhere for a while
[05:47:27] <Rockwood> but there is nothing to program
[05:47:37] <__adrian> ?
[05:47:42] <Rockwood> its CMS
[05:48:01] <Rockwood> just plugins installation stuff
[05:48:01] <stenno> you have never worked maintaining a CMS for a customer i see :)
[05:48:09] <__adrian> so is wordpress. would be nice if no one programmed with it
[05:48:20] <__adrian> but that's not how things work  ;)
[05:48:22] <lind{at}yahoo> Blondie101010: the position is not any technology or platform specific, its just the interview case study
[05:48:29] <Rockwood> in what sense WP is better?
[05:48:37] <__adrian> i didn't say it was
[05:48:58] <stenno> Rockwood: the customer mightt have specific ideas about how the page should work, and then you have to write your own stuff
[05:49:04] <lind{at}yahoo> Drupal 8 has a REST API, I'm just not finding a good article articulating its capabilities
[05:49:08] <Rockwood> yesterday i was go to interview there people doing installing thing in WP
[05:49:28] <stenno> we have a long-running CMS  in the adjacent company and its terrible
[05:49:31] <__adrian> lind{at}yahoo: claiming a job is nonspecific and then asking for a case study in drupal is ...suspicious
[05:49:35] <stenno> adjacent agency
[05:49:54] <Rockwood> lind{at}yahoo, why do you need only drupal?
[05:49:57] <__adrian> https://www.drupal.org/docs/drupal-apis
[05:50:02] <Blondie101010> lind{at}yahoo:  then in that same perspective, the interview would be meant to evaluate how you get information about technologies you know less, and that is not something you can learn in a short time frame
[05:50:25] <Blondie101010> if that's it, that requires many years of real experience
[05:50:37] <__adrian> ^ and that (how you study things you don't know about, and apply things you do) would be relevant
[05:50:46] <Rockwood> i think you just know the thing like how to add plugins in drupal case
[05:51:18] <Rockwood> and docs also helpful
[05:51:20] <lind{at}yahoo> the question is if I can leverage their API to pull metadata about the dashboards setup in the admin, transform that into an iOS UI (thinking about generating XAML against generalized viewmodel's controls in Xamarin) and bind that back to the Drupal data services in a generic way
[05:51:57] <lind{at}yahoo> I also noticed the Drupal API talks about a Hyper Application Language provider (HAL) which I also know nothing about
[05:53:15] <__adrian> yeah, write down the things you don't know about so you can follow up on them
[05:53:23] <__adrian> as for the api question, i'd say "probably"
[05:53:43] <__adrian> that's definitely something for a drupal-specific channel/forum though
[05:53:43] <lind{at}yahoo> Blondie101010: high level architects evaluate random technologies all the time and are expected to design high level solutions around them, it's not an unreasonable ask for the position I'm interviewing for. In fact they probably looked at my resume and specifically gave me something outside my background
[05:54:27] <Blondie101010> therefore if you are skilled for the job, you can do it *yourself*
[05:55:02] <Blondie101010> not trying to be rude, but realistic
[05:55:05] <lind{at}yahoo> I'm looking for guides to understand the capabilities and design of the platform and the Drupal docs are not cutting it
[05:55:07] <__adrian> not a quick answer. so back to "spend this time proving how well you can study"
[05:55:46] <lind{at}yahoo> __adrian: do you have any recommendations on communities I could bring this to?
[05:55:50] <Blondie101010> lind{at}yahoo:  but I also noticed you seem to be overthinking the simple diagram request they did
[05:55:50] <__adrian> i don't have a magic tutorial for drupal. drupal's got their own forums though
[05:56:14] <Blondie101010> a high level design would not involve API details
[05:56:16] <__adrian> https://www.drupal.org/forum
[05:56:57] <__adrian> they could probabl ypoint you
[05:57:04] <__adrian> s/ y/y /
[05:59:39] <lind{at}yahoo> I *could* draw up a diagram that abstracts the API and presents it in a way that that custom REST services encapsulate Drupal's and present in iOS, and yes that is probably what they are looking for. However if there's layout metadata in Drupal's API designing it so that Drupal drives the iOS app and developers rarely need to touch the iOS app it would be both impressive and the right strategy for the use case
[06:00:18] <__adrian> is your ios app just a phone-hosted website? that would work
[06:00:50] <__adrian> move the frontend off cloudflare and onto the sd card
[06:01:16] <Rockwood> for IOS in php possible?
[06:01:39] <__adrian> that's not what's being asked (and apple seems to hate php for some reason)
[06:02:04] <Rockwood> so its big no to PHP for IOS
[06:02:12] <__adrian> they're asking about an ios app that talks to a server that's running a php app
[06:02:45] <Rockwood> i asked my question
[06:03:13] <Blondie101010> Rockwood:  there are always ways, but the best solution is a VM
[06:03:40] <__adrian> actually building an app in php, i doubt it.
[06:03:59] <Rockwood> for IOS based app development in PHP?
[06:04:32] <Rockwood> VM creates virtual environment as server i think
[06:04:46] <Rockwood> am right thinking?
[06:04:52] <Blondie101010> hmmmm, wasn't thinking of a regular app
[06:05:16] <__adrian> i assumed Rockwood was asking about making an app, maybe not
[06:05:27] <Blondie101010> now it does seem like it
[06:05:33] <__adrian> but i wouldn't spend much time on figuring out how to php on ios regardless
[06:06:05] <Rockwood> okay i am leaving that topic now
[06:06:07] <Rockwood> np
[06:06:17] <Rockwood> i am working on JS things right now
[06:10:02] <lind{at}yahoo> __adrian: iOS native app
[06:13:12] <__adrian> right, i meant rockwod's question
[06:13:44] <__adrian> i was pretty sure about yours  :)
[06:14:24] <stenno> its technically possible if you do something like react-native but for php, but php doesn't really have the tools for something like that
[06:14:46] <stenno> it doesn't exist and thats most likely a good thing
[06:14:51] <Rockwood> stenno, with PWA?
[06:15:28] <stenno> dunno how pwa is relevant
[06:15:30] <Rockwood> PHP + Reactjs + PW
[06:15:33] <Rockwood> PWA
[06:15:40] <Rockwood> progressive app
[06:15:56] <Rockwood> https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/
[06:15:56] <Blondie101010> though I wouldn't qualify it as impossible, making a native anything in PHP is not brilliant as that is not how it was designed...  PHP is designed to be used as a service
[06:16:08] <__adrian> we know what it means
[06:16:51] <Rockwood> actually i am trying to guess correct meaning of stenno's suggestion
[06:17:08] <stenno> it doesn't exist and thats most likely a good thing
[06:17:14] <stenno> this is the important part of my statement
[06:17:36] <Rockwood> which is?
[06:18:10] <stenno> it doesn't exist and thats most likely a good thing
[06:20:16] <Rockwood> oh okay
[06:20:20] <Rockwood> got it thanks
[06:21:22] <Rockwood> https://developer.apple.com/swift/ looks like JS another face
[06:23:36] <Blondie101010> the syntax looks like a mix of JS and Python
[06:25:29] <stenno> obj-c
[06:25:40] <Blondie101010> that's swift
[06:25:44] <Rockwood> yes
[06:26:06] <lind{at}yahoo> this is really helpful: https://opensenselabs.com/blog/articles/monolithic-and-decoupled-drupal-architectures
[06:26:32] <stenno> swift is a rewrite of obj-c more or less
[06:27:17] <Rockwood> means JS also capable to do anything with node

[06:29:35] <Blondie101010> Rockwood:  why do you think that a language should the best choice to do anything?
[06:29:40] <Blondie101010> no
[06:30:05] <Blondie101010> you're confusing something
[06:30:17] <Rockwood> swift is mixing JS + python
[06:30:21] <Blondie101010> node is also a server process
[06:30:27] <Rockwood> yeah
[06:30:36] <Blondie101010> not a native app
[06:30:43] <Rockwood> node is similar and easy like PHP
[06:31:05] <stenno> react-native does not work at all like react
[06:31:09] <stenno> it just looks like it
[06:31:28] <Rockwood> react is front end as far as i know

[09:14:35] <gamara57> hey so is there a way to pass a class constructor function to an array? for instance I would like to be able to pass a string to a function and return a particular object given the string
[09:15:33] <Naktibalda> I can't understand what that means :)
[09:16:03] <Naktibalda> "pass to array" makes no sense
[09:19:15] <Naktibalda> could you give an example of array, of function or class and explains what is an expected result?
[09:19:39] <gamara57> is this allowed is what I am asking https://i.imgur.com/8lqICWm.png
[09:21:02] <Naktibalda> you can do $className = get_class($game);    and then do    new $className($id, ...$playerId);
[09:21:15] <Naktibalda> and you can keep class names in array
[09:21:54] <gamara57> wouldnt that give me the interface name though?
[09:22:04] <gamara57> or does get_class always give you the base class?
[09:22:33] <Naktibalda> it give you the class name of the object, not interface nor one of its parents
[09:22:44] <gamara57> ok neat
[09:22:57] <gamara57> thank you so much for the help you are awesome
[09:24:14] <gamara57> wait would I want to store it as a key pointing to nothing?

[13:56:00] <deksar> Thinking to rent a dedicated server with 128 GB DDR4 ECC. What PHP setting(s) would you recommend to have -performance- benefits of that much RAM? Planning to install FreeBSD 13 and PHP 8.x - Any suggestion would be much appreciated!
[13:56:24] <deksar> (And the CPU is: AMD Ryzen™ 9 3900 12-Core - NVMe disks)
[14:03:51] <AllenJB> I don't think there's any universal configuration for optimizing performance based on RAM. It totally depends on what you're doing on that server. In most cases PHP scripts aren't going to exceed a few MB of memory, unless you're doing something specifically intensive like PDF generation or image manipulation.
[14:04:46] <AllenJB> You could possibly look at opcache configuration, but again that's going to depend on things like whether the server is serving 1 site or 100, and the size of the code base(s)
[14:05:32] *** Joins: Junxter (~Junxter@222.95.221.25)
[14:07:24] <deksar> AllenJB: Great tips, will look and read further on these. Thanks. Lastly, I've read that CPU base clock frequency is much important than having more&multiple cores. So, basically, a AMD Ryzen 7 3700X CPU with 3.6 Ghz base CPU freq, would perform better than a "higher" CPU which is; AMD Ryzen 9 3900 12-Core, having 3.1 Ghz of speed. Is that completely true?
[14:07:46] <biberu> deksar: have you profiled and load tested your application? do you know how much resources you'll need? where the bottle necks are for different types of load?

[14:11:33] <biberu> but only you can know what your application needs
[14:11:41] <Red> if I want to use a shared module in a php-embed application, does php normally automatically dlopen the required module(s) or does it need to be done manually?
[14:13:36] <AllenJB> deksar: If there is a database service involved, look at the configuration for that. And I would suggest at that scale hosting the database on a dedicated server as this makes configuration tuning much easier and avoids it competing for the same resources
[14:13:37] <AllenJB> MySQL 8 for example has a "innodb dedicated server" setting that will allow it to autotune some settings if it knows it's the only thing running on a server
[14:13:50] <Red> testing it on a new port I am working on, but when I try calling bz2 for example it fails w/ "Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Call to undefined function bzopen()"
[14:16:15] <AllenJB> Red: That sounds like the bz2 PHP extension is not loaded. PHP does not autoload any extensions - you have to specifically tell it to using php.ini or at runtime using dl()

[18:19:55] <__adrian> which line are you referring to? but  new functionname()  is not a syntax error. it's something you wouldn't notice until runtime
[18:26:04] <gamara> does php support constant parameters syntax
[18:26:34] <gamara> for example in C++ string function hello(const string& hey); is valid syntax
[18:26:37] <Naktibalda> probably not, what is it?
[18:26:44] <gamara> is there an equivalent for php
[18:27:08] <gamara> because passing by reference is faster but maybe php abstracts that away
[18:28:38] <Naktibalda> passing by reference is not faster in PHP
[18:32:07] <__adrian> passing by reference is not faster
[18:32:17] <__adrian> and even if it were, that would be the wrong reason to do it
[18:33:20] <gamara> why isn't it faster?
[18:33:39] <gamara> its passing an address rather than doing a copying operation
[18:33:45] <gamara> with large objects its faster than copying
[18:33:56] <gamara> with small objects the difference would be negligible
[18:34:03] <Naktibalda> PHP uses copy-on-write, so it doesn't copy value until it is modified in one place
[18:34:10] <gamara> oh
[18:34:18] <Naktibalda> since 5.0
[18:34:20] <gamara> interesting
[18:34:22] <__adrian> don't try to outsmart things
[18:34:28] <gamara> yeah this isnt c++
[18:34:44] <__adrian> also values are not memory locations
[18:34:45] <gamara> I am not trying to outsmart things I just have a poor grasp of this language
[18:35:09] <gamara> well yeah the address is a value

[20:29:20] <akk> On a wordpress server where I maintain some code that's not part of wordpress, fopen("https://theserver/...") just started failing with "SSL operation failed with code 1, Failed to enable crypto".
[20:29:51] <TernaryOperator> biberu: //g ;)
[20:30:00] <TernaryOperator> but otherwise agreed
[20:30:20] <akk> I've worked around it by using dirname(__FILE__) instead of the https url, but I'm still puzzled why that started happening. I can load the https url in a browser and it works without errors.
[20:31:03] <__adrian> why would you be reading a file on your local filesystem via http?
[20:31:51] <akk> I'm not sure, code is from long ago and maybe I didn't know about __FILE__. :)
[20:32:11] <akk> Using dirname(__FILE__) is better and I'll stick with it, but I still wonder why it failed.
[20:32:35] <__adrian> re:  dirname(__FILE__):  __DIR__
[20:32:52] <akk> Thanks! Better still, I'll change it.

[20:47:12] <Sammitch> for those following along at home, LetsEncrypt used a cross-signed intermediate certificate and one of the root certs that signed it just expired. For newer versions of OpenSSL this is not a problem, but older versions hit the expired cert first and never re-try. RHEL/Centos 7 need to update ca-certificates to current, or blacklist the root via config, and this problem in literally every other OS means
[20:47:18] <Sammitch> you're hilariously out of date.

[21:41:02] <Creak[m]> Hello!
[21:41:02] <Creak[m]> Is there someone on Fedora that were able to debug a php script? I installed php-pecl-xdebug and restarted php-fpm, but when I try to debug using vs code, it just launches the php script but doesn't break at the breakpoints ☹️
[21:43:24] <da_wunder> have added xdebug configuration to your php.ini ?
[21:48:04] *** Quits: WishBoy (~WishBoy@user/wishboy) ()
[21:50:40] *** pmercado_ is now known as pmercado
[21:53:34] <Creak[m]> yep: `zend_extension=xdebug.so`
[21:54:29] <Creak[m]> here's what I have in my launch.json:
[21:54:39] * Creak[m] sent a code block: https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/a111c4efb3439b480e714b595870c17daf7aaa37
[21:54:43] <da_wunder> and that is not enough - you need to also configure that
[21:55:58] <da_wunder> eg. with xdebug 3 something like `xdebug.mode = coverage,debug,develop\n xdebug.start_with_request = yes\n xdebug.client_host = 127.0.0.1` - note that those are in own lines (added that \n) to show that
[21:55:58] <Creak[m]> I open my php script (named `mesamatrixctl`) and hit F5. I get the wanted output, but I don't stop at the breakpoint I've placed (like right at the beginning of the script) 😕
[21:57:06] <da_wunder> also note that xdebug 2 did use different configuration in php.ini file - so check your version and use proper configuration according to that version
[21:58:12] <da_wunder> personally I don't use vs code - so cannot really say how to configure xdebug to work with that - phpstorm has nice xdebug validation and so on

[22:00:16] <Creak[m]> ah.. just seen that port is 0, should it be 9000 ?
[22:00:37] <da_wunder> that port depends on your xdebug version
[22:00:46] <da_wunder> that was changed on v3
[22:01:23] <Creak[m]> I'm under xdebug 2.9.8
[22:02:28] <Creak[m]> maybe the vscode generation is for xdebug 3 and not 2, I'll check that
[22:02:30] <Creak[m]> thanks!
[22:02:30] <da_wunder> then that port should be that 9000, unless you've override that in your php.ini configuration
[22:03:29] <dag> Creak[m]: phpinfo() should show xdebug enabled. I also remember having to do xdebug.remote_enable=1 and xdebug.remote_autostart=1 this was for a cli script though

[22:05:05] <Creak[m]> ah nice! I'll check that right now
[22:05:17] <dag> usually you use a browser addon that includes a cookie or something with a key such that you configure your ide with xdebug.idekey="phpstorm"
[22:06:36] <Creak[m]> yas! that was it!
[22:06:48] <Creak[m]> I had the enable_remote, but not the remote_autostart
[22:07:24] <dag> great
[22:07:35] <Creak[m]> the thing is that I have both a command line tool and some more regular php/html pages

[22:13:53] <__adrian> did they revoke a key or something?

[22:14:22] <__adrian> mm
[22:14:37] <__adrian> how old

[22:56:31] <celphi> 255 is random #,.
[22:56:47] <__adrian> ...is there something there you need to validate?
[22:56:54] <TinoDidriksen> If you want to enforce a max length, actually check length and reject if it's too long.
[22:57:12] <__adrian> ^ if you're talking about length, that doesn't check length  :)
[22:57:12] <celphi> like i mean to prevent an attempt ofsomone trying to insert a really long str
[22:57:34] <TinoDidriksen> Reject invalid inputs. Don't try to masssage them to fit.
[22:57:41] <celphi> aight
[22:57:42] <__adrian> then sure, check the length.

[23:01:49] <celphi> really?
[23:02:01] <celphi> formats i get but encoding too?
[23:03:00] <celphi> `mb_detect_encoding` ?
[23:03:20] <biberu> yes, php strings are essentially byte arrays, incoming data may not be valid for your expected encoding
[23:03:59] <Sammitch> there's not really a reliable way to detect encodings though
[23:04:11] <biberu> ^
[23:04:31] <Sammitch> mb_make_educated_guess_at_what_encoding_might_be()
[23:04:41] <TinoDidriksen> You can check that it's valid UTF-8, and that's all you should ever need.
[23:05:09] <celphi> ok ty
[23:05:34] <__adrian> take json inputs  ;)
[23:06:33] *** Quits: guido (~guido@host-95-239-248-47.retail.telecomitalia.it) (Quit: WeeChat 3.2.1)
[23:08:09] <celphi> im reading they're all asci
[23:08:42] <celphi> yeah but im talking about after decoding of json __adrian
[23:10:07] <__adrian> php.net/json_decode
[23:10:40] <__adrian> and no, json is not ascii
[23:10:50] <__adrian> json is unicode. and in php, json is utf-8
[23:11:18] <celphi> sorry forgot i changed it to php://input
[23:11:41] <__adrian> changed what
[23:11:50] <celphi> file_get_contents('php://input')
[23:12:11] <celphi> i use file_get_contents('php://input') and javascript's new FormData
[23:13:25] <celphi> i read the raw data i guess
[23:13:33] <__adrian> what format?
[23:14:03] <__adrian> hm, duh  :p
[23:14:10] <celphi> my browser has meta tag for UTF-8,. but i use ajax in JS to build a fd object using new FormData. then on server i use file_get_contents('php://input')
[23:14:40] <celphi> so im guessing everything should be in ASCII then right?
[23:14:58] <__adrian> ...?  why would you guess that?
[23:15:29] <__adrian> you told the browser you like utf-8, and js uses (a variation of) ucs-2
[23:15:35] <__adrian> where's "ascii" figure into it?
[23:15:48] <celphi> well the values are outputing as ASCII in my error_log
[23:16:02] <celphi> when i use error_log(mb_detect_encoding($value));
[23:16:06] <__adrian> that is likely a coincidence
[23:16:24] <__adrian> try it with multibyte characters
[23:16:41] <__adrian> "a"  ← is this ascii or utf-8?
[23:16:43] <TinoDidriksen> Read the docs for detect encoding. If ASCII is an option, ASCII always wins.
[23:16:50] <celphi> both adrian
[23:16:54] <__adrian> no
[23:17:07] <celphi> utf-8 can represent any char
[23:17:10] <__adrian> it's one or the other. it could be either, yes
[23:18:08] <__adrian> https://php.net/mb_detect_encoding  ← see $encodings
[23:18:27] <TinoDidriksen> That one is literally both, though, because UTF-8 is a strict superset over ASCII. But generally, have mb_detect_encoding try UTF-8 before ASCII, because ASCII will win.
[23:18:47] <__adrian> i'd say don't detect ascii at all
[23:18:54] <Sammitch> most remotely-western encodings are a superset of ASCII
[23:19:08] <biberu> check, don't detect
[23:19:29] <TinoDidriksen> That too. Require UTF-8, check that it is actually UTF-8.
[23:19:39] <celphi> im so confused
[23:19:43] <__adrian> "strict detect" is effectively "check"
[23:20:17] <celphi> should i be doing `if (mb_detect_encoding($value) !== 'ASCII')` ?
[23:20:35] <TinoDidriksen> No, you should pass UTF-8 as encoding.
[23:20:54] <biberu> what encoding(s) you support are part of your interface, check that incoming data conforms and reject if not
[23:21:00] <__adrian> celphi: "abcñは०"  ← the first three characters could be ascii. all six characters are utf-8.
[23:21:20] <celphi> bc if i do UTF-8 they'll all fail. error_log(mb_detect_encoding($value)); is returning all ASCII
[23:21:20] <__adrian> as for mb_detect_encoding(), again, see $encodings
[23:21:31] <__adrian> celphi: no
[23:21:32] <TinoDidriksen> And importantly, any random raw byte stream will "detect" as ASCII.
[23:21:33] <__adrian> see my last
[23:22:05] <celphi> i dont understand what the encoding section is saying
[23:22:12] <celphi> it just refers to another function
[23:22:14] <__adrian> then ask about it
[23:22:16] <__adrian> don't ignore it
[23:22:23] <__adrian> no, it doesn't

[23:23:03] <__adrian> what encodings do you intend to support?
[23:23:08] <celphi> but i dont omit the encoding
[23:23:09] <__adrian> (hint: "UTF-8")
[23:23:24] <celphi> so wouldnt that only apply if i omit the encoding?
[23:23:24] <__adrian> you omitted the encoding in your example just then

[23:25:24] *** Joins: NakedKing (~NakedKing@user/nakedking)
[23:25:43] <biberu> celphi: it doesn't work that way, a given binary sequence may be valid for any number of encodings
[23:25:59] <__adrian> ^ and most will eventually be "valid" ascii
[23:26:13] <biberu> well, as long as they are 7 bit
[23:26:29] <__adrian> so  $encodings = "UTF-8"
[23:27:03] <__adrian> only exception being if you explicitly want to support others, and write code that specifically handles it.
[23:27:18] <celphi> so like error_log(mb_check_encoding($value), 'UTF-8');
[23:27:35] <__adrian> i don't know why you're using error_log
[23:27:37] <__adrian> but sure
[23:27:46] <celphi> to see values if they're passing or not
[23:28:15] <__adrian> $if_utf_8 = mb_check_encoding($string, "UTF-8", true) !== false;
[23:28:41] <__adrian> ok, so you're using it like a debug log (that's fine for dev i suppose)
[23:29:27] <da_wunder> for that encoding list, I remember to use this one - $list = [CP1252','UTF-8','ISO-8859-1','ASCII']; - but that was something that worked on my use case
[23:30:11] <__adrian> yeah, don't do that unless you _actually_ need it, understand what you're doing, and handle it properly
[23:31:15] <celphi> ok got it
[23:31:19] <Sammitch> da_wunder: you cannot meaningfully tell the difference between cp1525 and 8859-1 without a human looking at the resulting rendered pixels and going "that's not right"

[23:35:25] <Sammitch> I'm just going to lean on this old chestnut: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/279170/utf-8-all-the-way-through
[23:36:09] *** Joins: Kristine (~quassel@user/kristine)
[23:36:18] <da_wunder> yeah, sure you should use UTF-8 everywhere - but that is not the use case with applications that have 20+ years

[23:36:21] <Sammitch> and that you should absolutely _never_ guess what the encoding of your input is unless you want to wade through various circles of hell to figure it out reliably

[23:37:04] <Sammitch> if you don't know what encoding is used in the dat you're given, ask. if they don't know, berate.

[23:38:16] <Sammitch> "text encoding is metadata that you MUST explicitly know at all times. period." is a hill I will absolutely die on.
[23:38:17] <da_wunder> Sammitch: I was just trying to explain the real use case for you...
[23:38:25] *** Quits: Poboy (~Poboy@user/poboy) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[23:38:48] <Sammitch> it doesn't matter if the DB doesn't support UTF8, you MUST know what it IS. you do not guess.
[23:39:25] <da_wunder> and that is the exact problem within that application - we cannot know that metadata at all - so we need to guess what is coming in....
[23:39:29] *** Joins: Icedream (~icedream@hzn-b.serverkomplex.de)
[23:39:35] <Sammitch> if you don't know what encoding is used in the dat you're given, ask. if they don't know, berate.
[23:41:37] <da_wunder> sure that would be nice - but in our cases that is not the use case
[23:42:32] <Sammitch> then you are literally flipping a coin, counting luck as reliability, and are likely just unaware of where it fails.
[23:42:55] <da_wunder> any "customer" can upload files, that we have to process, client demands for this was that "customer must be able to upload any file in any format - you just need to handle it..."
[23:43:56] <TinoDidriksen> Yup, that is sometimes the job. Guessing is just part of handling untrusted input.
[23:44:01] <Sammitch> then the pushback is, "we can try, but it's not possible to avoid problems in this case."
[23:44:01] <da_wunder> and really I have tried to tell our client all those problems with this kind of approach - they just ignore those all and say "just deal with it..."
[23:44:10] *** Joins: NakedKing_ (~NakedKing@user/nakedking)
[23:44:32] <Sammitch> then they've signed off on the inevitable problems.
[23:44:51] <Sammitch> I mean really all you needed to say is "yes I know, but my client made me do it."
[23:45:07] <da_wunder> but, they think that we can solve that easily - it's just some code - right?
[23:45:10] <Sammitch> clients/bosses/users are universally the worst
[23:45:42] <Sammitch> "I can just look at it with my squishy human meat and know the answer, so a computer can do it, right? right."
[23:46:10] <da_wunder> exactly
[23:46:24] <Sammitch> tragically few people appreciate that they are walking around with a quantum computer between their ears
[23:47:14] *** Quits: NakedKing (~NakedKing@user/nakedking) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[23:49:07] <da_wunder> luckily that kind of clients/customers are the minor part, most of those just ask us "how to do something" and we provide the "best" answer with current information - and they just trust as judgement about that
[23:51:00] *** Quits: NakedKing_ (~NakedKing@user/nakedking) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:51:14] <Sammitch> my experience is more frequently "yes, that is the ideal solution. but we're not going to do that." T_T

[23:52:22] <Sammitch> well, speaking to management at least. the thing I like about where I am is that at least the devs take me seriously more often than not. :P

[23:54:38] <da_wunder> hmm, if management don't take you seriously - I would see that a major problem
[23:54:50] <da_wunder> personally I would not work on company like that
[23:55:58] <Sammitch> IMO it's a systemic issue where companies view IT as something that uses money and provides little value
[23:57:12] <Sammitch> Marketing wants another 50k/yr for conventions? approved! IT wants another 10k/year to keep the company from tipping over? bah they're a bunch of worrywarts.
