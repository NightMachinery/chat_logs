[01:55:07] <jeho> hello
[02:00:24] <rawtaz> HELLO
[02:04:03] <jeho> thought this might be a MS Azure related channel.. looks like it's for tech conferences?
[02:05:11] <rawtaz> this channel is for talk about devops and anything off-topic we can possibly think of
[02:05:22] <rawtaz> there is actually an #azure channel if you want to hit that one up
[02:11:48] <jeho> yeah.. I joined that one too
[02:12:04] <jeho> thanks rawtaz 
[02:12:12] <rawtaz> np :)
[02:12:18] <rawtaz> so what are you going for?
[03:31:49] <jeho> oh sorry. I didn't see your message earlier. I'm just playing around with the Azure DevOps API, learning about it.

[21:22:28] <rawtaz> thats a really odd nickname
[21:28:29] <kwilczynski> :)
[21:28:55] <kwilczynski> 0 days since rawtaz got startles by Latrina's nickname.
[21:29:00] <kwilczynski> startled*
[21:29:30] <rawtaz> hehe
[21:29:41] <rawtaz> it's striking, isnt it. makes you think :P
[21:30:08] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: I saw toilet paper covered in happy Alpacas today in the store.
[21:30:12] <kwilczynski> Also made me wonder.
[21:31:10] <rawtaz> lovely
[21:37:12] <Latrina> kwilczynski, lol
[21:37:30] <Latrina> I got a classy nick haven't I?
[21:39:44] <rawtaz> yes, definitely in a class of its own :P
[21:39:49] <kwilczynski> Latrina: You must explain its origin story to rawtaz.
[21:39:58] <kwilczynski> Latrina: Otherwise in two weeks time he will be puzzled again. :)
[21:40:02] <rawtaz> just dont start from the back..
[21:40:07] <Dus10> yo
[21:40:11] <rawtaz> or end, perhaps i should say
[21:40:11] <Dus10> Passed my AZ-400
[21:40:15] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: ... or the bottom.
[21:40:16] <Latrina> the story is simple
[21:40:17] <rawtaz> Dus10: uh wow
[21:40:27] * kwilczynski read this as AS/400 ...
[21:40:30] <kwilczynski> I am old.
[21:40:31] <kwilczynski> ;D
[21:40:50] <Dus10> I could see lots of people thinking that
[21:40:52] <rawtaz> oh gosh it's a microsoft thing Dus10 !
[21:40:57] <Latrina> I took the privilege of naming myself after the most ancient toilet in the world
[21:41:05] <rawtaz> i too thought it was some mainframe thing
[21:41:16] <rawtaz> Latrina: that is truly admirable!
[21:41:21] <Latrina> plus, I love calling somebody a latrina
[21:41:32] <Latrina> in my dialect it is somewhat the worst you can call a human being 
[21:41:33] <Latrina> rofl
[21:41:41] <Latrina> rawtaz, thanks
[21:42:20] <Latrina> check my NAS hostname

[21:42:54] <rawtaz> lol
[21:42:58] <Latrina> :)
[21:43:01] <rawtaz> you're really serious about naming :>
[21:43:05] <Latrina> ;)
[21:43:20] <Dus10> naming is one of the hardest things
[21:43:23] <Latrina> I'd love to tell you about my passwords but I'll skip this one 
[21:43:26] <Dus10> good job

[21:48:08] <kwilczynski> No wai.

[21:48:38] <kwilczynski> ;D
[21:48:49] <Latrina> thanks lantech19446 . Glad to hear this
[21:48:54] <lantech19446> wait someone has the nick cockbox? Who is she and why have I never spoken to her?
[21:49:09] <kwilczynski> Latrina: lantech19446: I don't know how to use computers. :) 
[21:49:21] <Latrina> I'll bother you in the future for sure
[21:49:22] <kwilczynski> This channels is for people of all shapes and forms.
[21:49:38] <Latrina> kwilczynski, define computer :P
[21:49:38] <lantech19446> that's good cuz i'm very round
[21:50:16] <Latrina> I work as Unix admin. I am somewhat old school despite being modestly young 
[21:50:46] <kwilczynski> Latrina: This thing. Has diodes that flash.
[21:50:53] <lantech19446> that's pretty cool Latrina I use linux but i'm lost on unix lol something about zsh that just breaks my brain
[21:50:54] <Latrina> I have been wanting to switch to a mid devops career 
[21:51:00] <kwilczynski> Latrina: And makes "beep boop" "bruum brrrrum" sound.
[21:51:22] <kwilczynski> Latrina: Also, shows me pretty pictures.
[21:51:23] <Latrina> lantech19446, nowadays is mostly linux all over
[21:51:25] <kwilczynski> ... of cats.
[21:51:38] <Latrina> except few solaris servers I administer as well
[21:51:51] <Latrina> and I am pretty much the only one in the company that knows Solaris
[21:51:56] <kwilczynski> What is a "devops career"?
[21:52:06] <Latrina> kwilczynski, don't know
[21:52:09] <lantech19446> I still remember when solaris was giving away the training for 11 for free
[21:52:27] <Latrina> I'd like to work more with kubernetes, automation, and perhaps learn some python ..
[21:52:29] <kwilczynski> What's "devops"?
[21:52:36] <Latrina> dunno
[21:52:55] <Latrina> lantech19446, never got that unfortunately. Too young :P
[21:53:07] <lantech19446> am I allowed to ask how young?
[21:53:13] <Latrina> 34
[21:53:25] <lantech19446> o ok so you really just missed it because i'm 39
[21:53:35] <Latrina> I started messing around with BSD and Linux almost two decades ago
[21:54:10] <lantech19446> that's awesome, 2 decades ago I was messing with html 1.01 lol and I had no idea that I'd be working on computers professionally one day
[21:54:12] <Latrina> lantech19446, actually I never knew Oracle had been giving Solaris training for free
[21:54:22] <Latrina> would have definitely taken it
[21:54:24] <lantech19446> this was before oracle owned them
[21:54:30] <Latrina> ahhhh
[21:54:44] <lantech19446> yea it was towards the end of sun microsystems lifespan
[21:55:37] <Latrina> I loved Sun
[21:56:56] <lantech19446> I never had much interaction with them but I remember the training because I thought it would be really cool to be a unix admin
[21:57:50] <Latrina> lantech19446, neither have I. But I loved their products and overall philosophy 
[21:58:03] <Latrina> Java, NFS, Solaris
[21:58:35] <Latrina> as matter of fact, Solaris 10 is the best OS I have ever used in my opinion 
[21:58:48] <Latrina> just a bit too slow for today's standard 
[21:59:13] <Latrina> I had high hopes for Illumos.. Sadly it didn't go as well as I had hoped.
[21:59:47] <lantech19446> someone just sent me a picture of solaris running on arm64
[22:00:05] <Latrina> for real?
[22:00:52] <Latrina> didn't know it ran on arm64. 
[22:01:09] <lantech19446> neither did I
[22:01:36] <Latrina> must be some kind of non-released port.. Or PSD
[22:02:24] <lantech19446> https://twitter.com/astr0baby/status/1465045809632849935
[22:02:57] <Latrina> yeah that's illumos gate
[22:03:23] <Latrina> and he is running it under Qemu
[22:03:57] <Latrina> but arm64 nonetheless
[22:04:13] <lantech19446> how did you know it's illumos? I don't see any reference to it
[22:04:33] <Latrina> he mentioned it in the comments section
[22:05:29] <lantech19446> gah ok I didn't even read them lol
[22:05:48] <Latrina> I can see that :)
[22:06:23] <lantech19446> so does the gate denote some special functionality or is it just what they call their OS now?
[22:06:44] <Latrina> illumos is the fork of OpenSolaris kernel
[22:06:55] <Latrina> illumos-gate is basically CURRENT branch

[22:14:27] <rawtaz> hmm ok
[22:14:35] <Latrina> however, a illumos hypervisor is not that ideal these days.
[22:14:56] <Latrina> even with behavye, KVM on linux is just way faster

[22:15:22] <Latrina> other than that, its a fine producgt
[22:15:22] <rawtaz> everything bsd and solaris related is way nicer and cooler than pesky linux
[22:15:24] <rawtaz> IMO
[22:15:26] <rawtaz> ok
[22:15:30] <Latrina> 100%
[22:16:10] <rawtaz> so lets see, are you using anything non-linux that isnt mac or windows?
[22:18:18] <Latrina> uhm
[22:18:26] <Latrina> at home no
[22:18:34] <Latrina> not anymore
[22:19:18] <Latrina> I have used FreeBSD for over 15 years, but two years ago I had to re-do and shrink the homelab
[22:19:37] <Latrina> ZFS runs fine on Linux these days, plus I need docker and kubernetes
[22:20:00] <Latrina> features that sadly FreeBSD doesn't offer
[22:20:16] <Latrina> at work I admin a bunch of Solaris servers
[22:20:26] <Latrina> and Cluster Data ONTAP
[22:21:31] <lantech19446> freeBSD is very cool though because they do host a whole shit ton of our ham radio software
[22:23:00] <Latrina> FreeBSD is the best :P
[22:23:09] <Latrina> just wish it had docker 
[22:23:14] <Latrina> at least docker
[22:23:43] <lantech19446> that would be cool
[22:23:55] <lantech19446> so what on earth is a zst file?
[22:25:16] <lantech19446> ok I just answered that question but I have no idea how to decompress it on windows which must be possible because it's an azure image

[23:17:16] <Dus10> I haven't paid attention to FreeBSD in a while... does it not have any container systen?
[23:19:09] <Dus10> looks like many options...
[23:19:23] <Dus10> although the first hit on the megasearch is a jail...
[23:19:36] <Dus10> that is only part of what makes a container... thanks megasearch
[23:20:03] <Dus10> containerd runs on FreeBSD
[23:21:17] <Dus10> hmm... I guess the implementation is really limited to jails
[23:24:33] <Latrina> Dus10, it does have jail
[23:24:47] <Latrina> jail is great, don't get me wrong 
[23:24:55] <Latrina> but docker is the leading standard
[23:25:18] <Dus10> jails doesn't provide process context, though, right?
[23:25:30] <Dus10> just filesystem fencing?
[23:25:41] <Dus10> or has it evolved over the years?
[23:27:21] <Dus10> okay, it does have the other features
[23:30:11] <lantech19446> Latrina: I figured out my problem, can't run it as a generation 2 VM
[23:30:56] <rawtaz> i love BSD :3 unfortunately i dont use it much because of business reasons

[23:32:33] <Latrina> Dus10, I can pretty much do anything I need with a Jail
[23:32:44] <lantech19446> I couldn't get the iso to load on hyper-v it will apparently only load on the older standard for hyper-v VM's what they call generation 1

[23:33:01] <Latrina> and from a networking prospective I can do way more advance networking that I could in a docker container
[23:33:14] <kwilczynski> Someone said Illumos?
[23:33:59] <Latrina> thanks to the EPAIR(4)
[23:34:17] <Latrina> lantech19446, oh hyperv.. 
[23:34:26] <Latrina> not my thing 
[23:34:59] <lantech19446> at work it's the only thing I can run because running vbox on the same host screws up my network connection and hyper-v outperforms it normally
[23:35:26] <kwilczynski> KVM!
[23:35:28] <kwilczynski> ;p
[23:35:35] <Latrina> sure, I am just not familiar with MS products in general
[23:36:07] <kwilczynski> I know MS Solitaire.
[23:36:08] <kwilczynski> ;D
[23:36:10] <Latrina> kwilczynski, do you use illumos?
[23:36:25] <kwilczynski> Latrina: I worked for Joyent ;(
[23:36:42] <Latrina> ah well..
[23:37:00] <kwilczynski> :[
[23:37:02] <Latrina> I spoke with Bryan Cantril a few times
[23:37:15] <Latrina> and that dev from Australia. Joshua or something I think he is called
[23:37:26] <Latrina> but haven't spoken with them in years
[23:37:31] <lantech19446> joshua tree?
[23:37:46] <Latrina> kwilczynski, what happened?
[23:37:58] <kwilczynski> Clulow
[23:38:04] <Latrina> lantech19446, I honestly don't remember the name of the guy
[23:38:13] <kwilczynski> Joshua "stubborn prick" Clulow
[23:38:27] <Latrina> I helped me quite a bit with some hickups I had with vmadm and json in general
[23:38:29] <kwilczynski> Latrina: Samsung bought us ;)
[23:38:50] <kwilczynski> Then Cantril made them upset.
[23:38:52] <Latrina> kwilczynski, I heard
[23:38:59] <kwilczynski> And things went to shit.
[23:39:05] <Latrina> :(
[23:39:08] <Latrina> sorry to hear
[23:39:22] <kwilczynski> No worries ;)
[23:39:48] <kwilczynski> I was just a member of a janitorial staff

[23:41:21] <kwilczynski> He knows me too well
[23:41:25] <kwilczynski> Yes.
[23:41:27] <kwilczynski> In fact.
[23:41:30] <kwilczynski> I got promoted.
[23:41:38] <kwilczynski> To whinging from cleaning.
[23:41:46] <kwilczynski> Nice pay increase.
[23:41:48] <Latrina> nice LOL
[23:42:35] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: oh was that the time when you took on two jobs ;)
[23:42:37] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: repeat()? Pff.... It's goto repeat;
