[00:49:26] <salem8171[m]> Hi, noob question here. From user perspective is there a difference between vim-polyglot and treesitter? Do both plugins do the same thing? Does it make sense to have both of them installed?
[00:50:41] <clason[m]> Apples and oranges.
[00:53:11] <salem8171[m]> I'm specifically talking about nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter plugin
[00:54:29] <salem8171[m]> Do both plugins have conflicting (even partial) functionality
[00:55:54] <ii14[m]> polyglot is a set of syntax files for vim, treesitter is a parser
[00:56:22] <ii14[m]> they can do the same thing, syntax highlighting
[00:56:29] <ii14[m]> I mean treesitter can do syntax highlighting
[00:57:08] <ii14[m]> * a parser library
[00:57:23] <dundargoc> Basically: polyglot is only for syntax highlighting, nvim-treesitter can do syntax highlighting but it can do more.

[00:57:51] *** Joins: scannerdarkly (~scannerda@rescomp-19-389322.stanford.edu)
[00:58:26] <dundargoc> I think if you use treesitter highlighting the vim highlighting turns off automatically.
[00:58:46] <ii14[m]> but treesitter is not available for every language, polyglot (or just default vim) supports way more languages
[01:00:31] <seandewar[m]> polyglot doesnt just provide syntax highlight btw
[01:00:38] <seandewar[m]> also provides indents and other ftplugin support
[01:00:46] *** Quits: neurocyte0917090 (~neurocyte@user/neurocyte) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[01:00:47] <ii14[m]> yeah and compiler settings I think
[01:00:51] <seandewar[m]> ye
[01:00:56] <seandewar[m]> nvim-treesitter also comes with some extra goodies too
[01:00:58] <clason[m]> Honestly? If that's where you're coming from, stick with polyglot.
[01:01:47] <clason[m]> Nvim-treesitter is early access.
[01:02:12] <seandewar[m]> tbh one of my biggest gripes with polyglot is that it also does some extra stuff outside of its language support
[01:02:13] *** Joins: neurocyte0917090 (~neurocyte@user/neurocyte)
[01:02:56] <seandewar[m]> had it break a few other plugins i had because it screwed around with stuff like fileignorecase at one point
[01:03:11] <clason[m]> It's a shotgun approach
[01:03:34] <clason[m]> It's the original LunarChad.
[01:03:34] <salem8171[m]> I more or less get the difference, but now it's even harder for me to make a choice x)
[01:04:23] <salem8171[m]> Thank you all for the help anyway
[01:07:03] <salem8171[m]> So if I understand correctly polyglot does not benefit from treesitter right?
[01:07:16] <ii14[m]> no
[01:07:54] <ii14[m]> polyglot is highly specific to vim, it extends what vim already does, while treesitter gives you access to ast
[01:08:04] <ii14[m]> the overlap is only in the syntax highlighting
[01:08:46] <clason[m]> And both will lead to tears if installed without thinking.
[01:09:05] <ii14[m]> I don't think so, polyglot should more or less just work
[01:09:54] <clason[m]> Unless one of the 600 syntax files interferes with another plugin you happen to have installed.
[01:09:55] <ii14[m]> like there can only be problems with filetype detection or something like that
[01:10:02] <ii14[m]> yeah sure
[01:10:09] <clason[m]> "only" :D
[01:11:03] <seandewar[m]> honestly im of the opinion that you should just install the specific language support plugins that you're gonna actually use
[01:11:36] <clason[m]> And same for the tree-sitter parsers.
[01:12:24] <salem8171[m]> I have been using polyglot for a while now and it is working great, but nvim sometimes chokes on some of the large files (although some of it is caused by cursorline). So I was considering to try treesitter to see if I can get better performance.
[01:12:41] <clason[m]> If you actually work with 594 different languages, your editor is the least of your problems.
[01:12:57] <ii14[m]> salem8171[m]: i have that with zsh, but there is no treesitter parser for zsh
[01:13:10] <clason[m]> That very much depends on the language.
[01:13:24] <clason[m]> Mostly it's a trade-off
[01:13:42] <clason[m]> Some things work better, others (still) worse

[07:19:59] <arch-angel> is there is a plugin that ensures that you only use certain type of variable naming style for certain types of declarations?
[07:20:17] <arch-angel> like it ensures that you only use lowerCamel for variables and functions

[13:41:02] <hkuptyHenryJohnK> the thing w/ `desc` and `command` doesn't really make any difference here... I thought that `command` would show up as `autocmd: TabLeave * ...` or something if I didn't have `desc` enabled. Since that's not the case, then this is all just noise and doesn't interfere with the actual intent of the issue
[13:41:15] <hkuptyHenryJohnK> I'll make sure to fill up an issue later on
[13:43:19] <clason[m]> ah, OK, that's a different issue
[13:44:38] <clason[m]> yes, I believe the intention was not to repeat input, but as you say, since you can use any combination as input, it makes sense to at least output the missing fields (in which case it might be easier to just output all unconditionally)

[16:44:19] <bloony> Is it possible to get some colors on the diagnostic text box? Its all in red now.. like for missing interface functions in golang it would be nice to see the function name in a different color so its easier to spot it right away..

(Specifically, I can't seem to figure out how the extmark_get function accounts for things before the start of the range and lack the C debugging knowledge to investigate it effectively).

[23:19:39] <bfredl> this way, your project is not tied to a particular editor, so you could have a collaborator using emacs :]
[23:19:45] <ii14[m]> you need to learn the syntax ofc, but it's not that hard

[23:20:11] <arshiaaghaei[m]> Np
[23:20:13] <arshiaaghaei[m]> Friithian: What's the difference with make?
[23:20:21] <Friithian> cmake generates a make file for you
[23:20:31] <Friithian> it can also auto-find deps, do a lot of other stuf ffor you

[23:23:58] <arshiaaghaei[m]> These are new tbh
[23:24:09] <ii14[m]> the tab character, `\t`
[23:24:23] <ii14[m]> you can indent code with either spaces or tabs
[23:24:47] <arshiaaghaei[m]> Hard tab means using the actual tab instead of 4 spaces?
[23:25:16] <ii14[m]> yes. vim should automatically set it to hard tabs when you edit the makefile, but just so you know
[23:25:29] <arshiaaghaei[m]> I gotcha

[23:26:29] <arshiaaghaei[m]> I gotcha
[23:26:38] <arshiaaghaei[m]> Sure, I can do that
[23:27:08] <ii14[m]> that's the thing when you don't use IDEs, you have to understand what the tools under the hood are actually doing

[23:30:35] <arshiaaghaei[m]> Python is interperted
[23:30:38] <arshiaaghaei[m]> Not compiled
[23:30:47] <ii14[m]> I mean I sometimes use make just for convenience

[23:47:23] <arshiaaghaei[m]> But then only one file has the main function and that should be the one turned into a build file
[23:47:26] <ii14[m]> cmake should figure everything out
[23:47:34] <arshiaaghaei[m]> Oh gotcha
