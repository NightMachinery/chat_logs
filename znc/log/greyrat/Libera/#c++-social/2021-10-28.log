[13:33:41] <Carbonflux> well, looks like Stadia has gone tits up
[13:33:50] <Carbonflux> happened sooner than i expected
[13:34:11] <Carbonflux> google sure likes to give up on things.
[13:34:29] <Carbonflux> or maybe its who they hire somehow.
[13:34:38] <Carbonflux> i just don't know.
[13:35:41] <Carbonflux> its interesting really, Luna seems to be doing fine, like netflix for games.
[13:35:58] <Carbonflux> they just run windows on their old compute machines.
[13:36:17] <Raziel> not entirely sure by what metrics luna is doing fine
[13:36:21] <Carbonflux> Stadia has a complex backend that had to be ported too
[13:36:24] <Raziel> but their business model does make a lot more sense at least
[13:37:14] <Carbonflux> i mean fine by being able to host any windows game, they have a lot of 2d games even.
[13:37:55] <Carbonflux> both Stadia and Luna have the same compression artifacts, which is the most annoying thing imo
[13:38:35] <Carbonflux> but Luna can basically run present any windows game.
[13:39:04] <Carbonflux> i was reading a post on reddit where someone managed to open a console and get the machine specs.
[13:39:53] <Carbonflux> it was a Xeon with 32 gig of ram and the gpu was a Tesla with 14 gig
[13:40:24] <Raziel> well, I suppose compression artifacts are a bit unavoidable
[13:40:29] <Carbonflux> why overkill but interesting, seems like amazon is just reusing computing units
[13:40:51] <Raziel> if you look at stadia, they use 35mbps streams for 4k 60hz HDR
[13:41:23] <Raziel> where an uncompressed stream of that would be about 15gbps
[13:42:32] <Carbonflux> ya, there are a lot of assumptions.
[13:42:50] <Carbonflux> i am playing games that would not run at 30fps on my machine
[13:43:00] <Raziel> well, ofc
[13:43:12] <Raziel> I'm only talking about the bandwidth requirements of a perfect video stream with those specs
[13:43:26] <Renderwww> just play different games
[13:43:34] <Carbonflux> so i would actually rather have a steady 30fps with video level  compression
[13:43:34] <Raziel> play moar factorio
[13:44:43] <Carbonflux> the compression artifacts kinda ruin stuff, they are so extreme
[13:45:01] <Carbonflux> i have a gigbit connection after all
[13:45:17] <Carbonflux> but anyway, i hear they are working on it
[13:45:21] <Carbonflux> early days really
[13:45:45] <Carbonflux> anyway, Stadia is going to switch to becoming a backend i am reading
[13:46:17] <Carbonflux> but you actually have to port you game to "linux" to run on Stadia
[13:46:41] <Carbonflux> so i am not so sure its viable, even tho i would like it to be, because, linux.
[13:49:35] <Carbonflux> for some reason google decided to build a custom linux environment to support the games, you have to work with google to port a game to their platform, but it turns out google just fired all the people in that group.
[13:49:51] <Carbonflux> Luna on the other hand just runs windows.
[13:50:18] <Carbonflux> they add a couple of games a week, a lot of indy games too.
[13:51:26] <Carbonflux> i think the main problem will be if Luna gets popular
[13:52:01] <Carbonflux> they seem to be just reusing their AI/math units to run the games.
[13:52:32] <Carbonflux> so they could run out of resources i guess.
[13:53:18] <Carbonflux> sounds like the Nvidia cloud gaming system is having that problem right now, long waits and limits on play time.
[13:53:34] *** Quits: fuck (~ittsya@95.67.115.93) (Quit: WeeChat 2.8)
[13:53:37] <Carbonflux> in the end tho i think cloud gaming is going to be important for VR
[13:54:03] <Carbonflux> 5G connection, glasses that are just display, etc.
[13:54:59] <Carbonflux> 10 years from now you will just put on some glasses and be in a photoreal VR env.
[13:55:39] <Carbonflux> anyway, thats what my ESP tells me.
[13:55:44] <Raziel> that's a very optimistic estimate 
[13:57:46] <Carbonflux> well, its based on years of experience watching people look for new markets, and this is a big market. I have a friend who worked for Oculus, he stayed on when facebook bought them, he claims they are throwing a lot of money at this.
[13:59:01] <Carbonflux> i guess the main missing piece is a unified VR platform that has good APIs 
[13:59:27] <Carbonflux> seems like this is what facebook wants to build but i am not sure they are right people to do it
[13:59:31] <Raziel> they may also be a bit optimistic
[13:59:52] <Carbonflux> they might need to be
[14:00:03] <Carbonflux> just for survival.
[14:00:34] <Carbonflux> i admit it can seem that way
[14:00:46] <Carbonflux> i remember in the 90s, everyone was into VRML
[14:00:57] <Carbonflux> a lot of the same stuff was being said
[14:01:03] <Carbonflux> and it died
[14:01:14] <Carbonflux> maybe you're right
[14:02:22] <Carbonflux> still, i like the idea of cloud gaming because i am sick of having to maintain a gaming machine.
[14:02:31] <Carbonflux> just lazy i guess.
[14:03:14] <Raziel> also, just a few years ago, 3D TVs and movies were the next big thing (again).
[14:03:19] <Raziel> that worked out great...
[14:03:27] <Raziel> and then the curved TVs. bloody hell, fucked the curved TVs
[14:03:30] <Carbonflux> 3D is hard
[14:03:38] <Raziel> it is
[14:04:02] <Raziel> having relatively bulky glasses strapped to your head for decent periods of time is also hard
[14:04:22] <Raziel> being completley cut off from your surroundings during that time is also hard. it's actually quite draining. v:
[14:05:02] <Carbonflux> well, thats the point i was trying to make about cloud gaming, with 5G cellular you don't need bulky glasses.
[14:05:18] <Carbonflux> ya, i think AR will be what we end up with.
[14:05:41] <Carbonflux> so in both cases its an issue of physics.
[14:05:48] <Raziel> most of the bulk is the required optics distancing and screens and such, not the computing hardware
[14:05:52] <Carbonflux> we need transparent screens.
[14:06:14] <Raziel> non-standalone headsets are just as bulkier or bulkier than the quest, even though the quest has computing hardware inside
[14:06:21] <Raziel> bulky* even
[14:06:34] <Carbonflux> and holograms are going to require a even deeper physics we don't have yet.
[14:06:45] <Carbonflux> why do you say that?
[14:06:56] <Raziel> well, fake holograms projected on a transparent screen, maybe not as much
[14:07:18] <Raziel> why do I say what? that they're bulkier? because they are v:
[14:07:42] <Carbonflux> thats just a production issue really
[14:08:12] <Carbonflux> we can make lite glasses if there is a reason to ramp up production.
[14:08:20] <Raziel> https://vr-compare.com/compare?h1=0jLuwg808-j&h2=pDTZ02PkT
[14:08:53] <Raziel> valve index, which is supposed to be the cream of the crop, is 300g heavier than the quest 2, even though the quest 2 can play its own games
[14:09:04] <Raziel> that's insane
[14:09:32] <Carbonflux> those are really just prototypes tho. There is no actually physics issue with making lite glasses.
[14:09:45] <Raziel> well selling prototypes for a grand isn't gonna expand the market much
[14:09:52] <Carbonflux> agreed
[14:10:27] <Carbonflux> if Steve Jobs was still around he would just demand it ;)
[14:10:40] <Carbonflux> make it thin!
[14:10:45] <Carbonflux> and people would do it
[14:10:51] <Carbonflux> very weird
[14:11:01] <Raziel> and then sell it for $4000 and people would buy it because it's apple?
[14:11:03] <Raziel> idk if that would fly
[14:11:24] <Carbonflux> you knew that was wrong when you said it
[14:11:33] <Carbonflux> its just a question of will at this point.
[14:12:05] <Raziel> it's also a question of economics. it's not like valve didn't invest probably shittons of money into it, it still came out expensive and bulky
[14:12:06] <Carbonflux> no one is ready to risk the investment.
[14:12:17] <Raziel> how much more expensive would it need to be, to be able to be lighter or smaller?
[14:12:39] <Raziel> and who would buy such an expensive toy? :p
[14:13:07] <Carbonflux> it needs to be like skiing goggle and cost around 200$
[14:13:22] <Carbonflux> but thats not the issue
[14:13:32] <Raziel> I mean, yeah, that would be a big improvement lol
[14:13:33] <Carbonflux> there needs to be a unified VR world
[14:14:04] <Carbonflux> if we had a world worth visiting, the technology would emerge.
[14:14:18] <Carbonflux> its a chicken/egg thingie
[14:14:27] <Raziel> yeah
[14:14:41] <Raziel> generally most markets fill an already existing need
[14:14:47] <Carbonflux> ya
[14:15:13] <Carbonflux> i think facebook sees this but i am not convinced they can make it happen.
[14:15:43] <Raziel> so far they're doing better than the rest, for what that's worth
[14:15:59] <Carbonflux> ya
