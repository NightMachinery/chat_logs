[01:19:19] <zenof> another one: I have an ext4-fs inside an encrypted block device that and I was used to be able to mount via gvfs-mount (eg nautilus), thus unlocking and mounting in one go. now, this fails. however I am able to unlock it manually and doing an fsck on that file-system says that the physical size was exactly one block smaller than the file-system that lives in it (according to the superblock) . What are possible causes and how to fix that? does it mean
[01:19:20] <zenof> simply one block died?
[01:22:00] <axsuul> I'm on 20.04 and have an Intel Rocket Lake CPU w/ QuickSync. My issue is I'm currently unable to get QuickSync working, suspecting maybe my driver doesn't support my CPU. It looks like this is the driver `intel-vaa-driver` that corresponds to the Intel CPUs but Rocket Lake doesn't look like it's supported (I also checked 21.04 and it's also the same). Do I need to look for another driver? Here is `intel-vaa-driver` https://ubuntu.pkgs.org/20.04/ubuntu-unive

[02:48:58] <jhutchins> axsuul: What's your actual goal? What are you trying to accomplish"
[02:49:00] <jhutchins> ?
[02:49:32] <axsuul> jhutchins: To get QuickSync working in Ubuntu. However I believe the issue is that I need to run at least 21.04 since I have a Rocket Lake CPU and 20.04 doesn't support it
[02:49:47] <jhutchins> Yes, but what are you trying to DO with it?
[02:49:59] <axsuul> jhutchins : Ah sorry, use hardware transcoding in Plex :)
[02:50:42] <axsuul> jhutchins: Referring to this repo I found, it mentions that 21.04 is needed: https://github.com/jjarthur/media-box#jellyfin
[02:50:46] <jhutchins> axsuul: Ah, there we go.  You expect it to go more slowly without "QuickSync"?

[06:28:03] <Nobrem> it borders on bullying

[06:29:20] <tar_xvf> ok, the file is probably corrupted in a ray ffmpeg can't read it
[06:29:44] <tar_xvf> you could also try opening the file with ffplay, vlc, or another media player to see if it should work
[06:29:53] <Nobrem> yes, done so, it works

[06:30:26] <Gallomimia> nobrem, i just told you to use a different program and test if the file can be read
[06:30:41] <Gallomimia> if yes, not ubuntu issue, go to ffmpeg support. if no, that's a ubuntu issue
[06:30:49] <Gallomimia> and we can figure more out together

[09:38:00] <Nobrem> bugweiser, I did not zero it,  but I ran the normal installation process of the Ubuntu Server Edition which created a new partition table
[09:38:19] <Nobrem> the computer came without OS
[09:38:22] <bugweiser> let me be more explicit, you put a file system on it
[09:38:31] <Nobrem> bugweiser, I believe so?

[09:38:45] <Nobrem> bugweiser, it is a second hand computer
[09:38:51] <bugweiser> I also believe that, couse you said you installed something on it, therefor it must have a filesystem

[09:43:30] <ELQEYNN> You mean, that when you hit "z" you get "z"? And when you hit "y" you get "y" ?
[09:43:51] <Nobrem> yes
[09:44:02] <Nobrem> but I am used to a different keyboard layout
[09:44:09] <bugweiser> Nobrem, I think you are looking at 2 different things
[09:44:16] <bugweiser> the first shows you the mbr partitions
[09:44:18] <Nobrem> bugweiser, whz so?
[09:44:24] <bugweiser> the second shows you the vbr of one of these partitions
[09:44:26] <Nobrem> *why
[09:44:50] <ELQEYNN> So, if  you change the keyboard layout in the software configuration, you'll hit "z" and you get "y" and vice versa.
[09:44:52] <Nobrem> bugweiser, it looks to me like I am already running out of space
[09:44:57] <bugweiser> why? the latest linux distro's create many vbr partitions these days (cought me offguard this week as well, hence I know :) )

[09:45:53] <Nobrem> ELQEYNN, I believe "xmodmap" can solve this... I will let you know later
[09:46:02] <bugweiser> yeah, I'm a fan of some partitions as well, this is to much.. same on openbsd

[09:47:11] <Nobrem> I will fix the keys like this
[09:47:21] <ELQEYNN> xmodemap will result in hitting "z" and getting "y" and vice versa -- unless you also change your hardware keyboard.
[09:47:26] <Nobrem> the biggest problem for now is my hard drive siye
[09:47:27] <Nobrem> size
[09:47:39] <bugweiser> 200 GB video files on a 250gb raw disk.. thats barely gonna fit on a modern heavily partitioned disk
[09:48:18] <Nobrem> bugweiser, why so?  Is there a file size limit on linux like it was back in the day on FAT32 Windows machines?
[09:48:44] <bugweiser> no it is becouse putting a filesystem on a partition costs space
[09:49:12] <bugweiser> so a raw disk never has the total raw space to use (well , it is used, by a TOC (or similar)).
[09:49:22] *** Joins: BSaboia (~bsaboia@177.37.198.83)
[09:49:33] <bugweiser> on top of that, the modern linux uses a bunch of partitions (as you have shown in link 2)

[09:50:22] <Nobrem> look at the leftmost column "Size"
[09:50:24] <bugweiser> you can try re-install it, and try to override some default settings such that you get LESS number of partitions.
[09:50:56] <bugweiser> well, you can try chop up your video files, and try fill all unused space of each partition...
[09:51:01] <bugweiser> that might just work
[09:51:05] <Nobrem> bugweiser, the partitions are imho not the issue
[09:51:12] <Nobrem> df -h lists you the total siye

[09:59:38] <bugweiser> its like a second mbr
[10:00:13] <bugweiser> it can contain boot-code, it can contain partition layout (and that layout depends on the bootsystem used).
[10:00:27] <bugweiser> you could think of it a LITTLE like this:
[10:01:00] <bugweiser> you have one physical disk, you give it bootcode and partitions (up to 4) in the mbr (up to 4 due to legacy bios, when in mbr mode).
[10:01:19] <bugweiser> now you could think of the partitioned disk as a number of new individual disks
[10:01:37] *** Quits: humberto1 (~humbertow@189.131.31.180) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[10:01:44] <bugweiser> and each first sector itself could contain another thing LIKE an mbr, optionally splitting down partitions further.
[10:02:12] <bugweiser> so for example you chop the 3 partition (starting from the physical disk) into yet again 8 partitions.
[10:02:20] <bugweiser> windows used to call them 'extended partitions;
[10:02:45] <bugweiser> and the 4 from the mbr (the entry point of the physical disk, sector 0) were called 'primary partitions'.

[10:03:03] *** Quits: sdfgsdfg (~sdfgsdfg@user/sdfgsdfg) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[10:03:05] <bugweiser> so in windows terminology, you'd create 'extended partitions' inside primariy partitions.
[10:03:26] <rfm> that 98G partition is an lvm logical volume, you'd have to use lvm tools to expand it (but don't ask *me* how)
[10:03:36] <bugweiser> (but it doesn't need to end there.. technically you could chop up extended (kind of second level) partitions again and put vbr in them as well.

[10:36:18] <rfm> there's a lot of history here.  uuencode was part of BSD.   The gnu sharutils were a rewrite by the GNU project that did some of the same stuff  (basically, make it possible to send binary files through email that might not even be 8-bit clean)

[14:24:51] <Aarch64debian> hello, how do you find lost partition/fix broken partition table
[14:25:15] <tomreyn> Aarch64debian: testdisk, if you are running ubuntu
[14:25:28] <tomreyn> a supported ubuntu version, specifically
[14:25:41] <Aarch64debian> is it good
[14:26:16] <tomreyn> if you know or spend time on understanding how to use it, yes
[14:26:30] <nominickle> "that's if it's still available"Â  Bingo.
[14:28:15] <tomreyn> nominickle: usually, the latest version should work fine. if it doesn't, you also should have the last but one installed so should be able to boot into that instead. independently from that, on an LTS release, you can also switch between GA and HWE versions
[14:28:23] <nominickle> tomreyn:Â  What appears to be the case is that the repos I am drawing from have wiped all the older versions of all the packages that actually do anything, hence everything which might undo whatever changed (and which I am assuming broke my system).
[14:29:06] <tomreyn> that's all the help i can provide without more specific info
[14:29:54] <nominickle> Where/how would I have the last but one version available/installed?Â  I've got several versions of the kernel installed but the various flavors of systemd et al are version jealous.
[14:31:24] <nominickle> How do I switch to GA or HWE version?Â  If they've got a recent rev I can draw that will presumably be enough to convince me to poke at hardware instead.
