[01:17:52] <sney> the standard for controlling audio in debian these days is to use some other system like pulseaudio or pipewire or jack, rather than manipulating alsa directly. but it's still in the archive and available for people to use, if they want to.
[01:18:09] <ctcx> No, it does go to a weird page; just not to the original site

[01:19:26] <sney> ctcx: by "doesn't go anywhere" I meant that there is no sign of alsaequal on that site anymore. from the very minimal content there, it sounds like the developer quit computing.
[01:19:52] <n4dir> and still the version in testing and sid seems higher than in bullseye
[01:19:53] <sney> maybe the url needs to be updated, but there also hasn't been a new upload of alsaequal to debian since 2019.

[01:20:33] <sney> alsa is the linux kernel sound drivers. all audio on linux uses alsa, with few exceptions.
[01:20:44] <sney> pulseaudio is basically an abstraction layer, it sits on top of alsa.
[01:22:23] <n4dir> if i understood correct pipewire is an "abstraction layer" for alsa and pulseaudio and jack. lol. Lets hope i misunderstood

[02:41:37] <xx> Khepra: I can't get over the forced update aspect of snaps
[02:41:51] <somiaj> yet you complain that chromium isn't forced updated in debian?
[02:42:52] <somiaj> browers are just nightmares, they are so vital for so much, but a pain to keep a solid stable version that either doesn't get to old for extensions/security issues or require regular updates which causes a whole set of new issues
[02:42:57] <somiaj> espically when they take so long to build

[02:44:24] <xx> let's just say I'm not comfortable with someone else *forcing* me to do something, which is exactly what snap does with its autoupdates. There have been long times in my life where I had zero control over my own life, and this has caused me to now want to try to retain any control I can.

[02:47:24] <Khepra> somiaj: it's different. the problem with snaps is taht you have zero control of _when_ the upgrade will come. mid-work, pfft, wham bam thank you, eff your data.
[02:47:32] <n4dir> ctcx: try #opensourcemusicians or #lau (too) ; though both channels are rather silent.
[02:47:40] <Khepra> "forced" upgrade of a chromium .deb, you still have to pull the apt trigger.
[02:48:10] <Khepra> (and if you're using unattended upgrades, GoodLuckWithThat(tm) anyway)
[02:48:56] <somiaj> ahh, didn't realize snap would make you auto update

[02:50:46] <somiaj> though I'm running the stable chromium, not bookworm
[02:51:49] <xx> that's so strange, I'm on debian-stable, and extensions/history/bookmarks don't work
[02:52:12] <somiaj> well that bug report clearly states issues with the version in bookworm, and works fine here
[02:52:39] <somiaj> though I have been using chromium less and less recentally and mostly just use firefox-esr (mostly due to I find the new rust firefox nicer these days)
[02:53:29] <xx> I might be experiencing an unrelated bug then. I too use firefox-esr instead anyway, and flatpak version of chromium now.

[03:17:48] <ctcx> Using Debian 11 x64. Have an old 32bit game. So installed all required 32bit libraries. But cannot with libasound2-plugin-equal because it has a multi-arch bug which prevents both versions to coexist.
[03:18:24] <ctcx> So tried making a copy of alsaequal 32bit libraries and put them into game directory.
[03:18:43] <ctcx> But seemingly ALSA refuses to read them unless forcibly within system's library location.
[03:19:54] <ctcx> Is there a way to make ALSA read alsaequal from elsewhere?

[07:25:03] <judd> No package named 'steam' was found in amd64.
[07:25:09] <somiaj> hmm that package is in a strange state, what does 'dpkg --purge steam:i386' do?
[07:28:17] <awal1> myrrh, wat you get with    dpkg -l | grep i386
[07:28:18] <myrrh> https://imgur.com/a/8ZtMIPS
[07:28:53] <somiaj> myrrh: that is jsut telling you what I already said, you also have to remove $HOME/.steam to get rid of it compeltey
[07:30:29] <myrrh> https://paste.debian.net/1216357/
[07:31:20] <somiaj> you don't have to share things, so now that you have remove the steam package and the .steam dir is done, does vrms stop stating you have it installed?
[07:31:47] <myrrh> somiaj: Ohhhhhhh it was installed in root's $HOME!!!
[07:32:10] <somiaj> you must have ran steam as root then, usually best to avoid running stuff like that as root

[09:38:46] <Blondie101010> oh well...  it's a fresh install, so you can try a newer version

[15:12:19] <Haohmaru> !nvidia
[15:12:19] <dpkg> Where possible, Nvidia graphic processing units are supported using the open source <nouveau> driver on Debian systems by default.  To install the proprietary "nvidia" driver, see https://wiki.debian.org/NvidiaGraphicsDrivers or ask me about <nvidia dkms>, <nvidia legacy>; installing this directly from nvidia.com (i.e. with <nvidia-installer>) is _not_ supported in #debian,.
[15:13:16] <vqueiroz> For the record, I do not have this problem in Arch Linux.  So I'm not sure what's going on.
[15:14:05] <monaco> paul424: type on terminal xrandr

[15:19:33] <dpkg> The nouveau open source <DRM> drivers for Nvidia GPUs (Riva, TNT, GeForce, Quadro) are part of the Linux kernel and the display driver is packaged as xserver-xorg-video-nouveau (read its README.Debian file for important notes).  Install the libgl1-mesa-dri package for 3D acceleration. Firmware from userspace may be required, ask me about <nouveau firmware>. http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/
[15:20:22] <paul424> xserver-xorg-video-nouveau is already the newest version (1:1.0.16-1)
[15:20:35] <paul424> Haohmaru, so hwo do I get higher resloution
[15:21:11] <Haohmaru> does your monitor talk to your videocard?
[15:21:39] <Haohmaru> usually the monitor has to tell the videocard/OS what kinds of modes it supports
[15:22:00] <Haohmaru> that was called "EDID" or some such
[15:22:42] <Haohmaru> when it fails to work, the thing usually would try to get <some> picture out via some supposedly fail-safe defaults, like 640x480

[17:11:04] <Haohmaru> then it turns out btrfs did not have a mechanism to find then and mark them
[17:11:20] <PMT> ext4 is the "old reliable" choice. btrfs would be a "new hotness" choice.

[17:13:05] <PMT> Khepra: to be fair, I think ZFS might have also had this problem at this point in its life relative to btrfs.
[17:13:21] <PMT> Can't recall when the slop space was added.
[17:13:37] <Haohmaru> what's this zfs about?
[17:13:48] <Khepra> PMT: no, not for the same reasons. BTRFS by design uses profile'd chunks. and even if you had gazillion bytes left in "raid1" chunk, the fact your raid degraded, btrfs started consuming "single" chunks and poof, you're out of space.

[17:14:35] <PMT> Khepra: ah, I see. Yeah, no, ZFS had other reasons for that.
[17:14:44] <Khepra> it's literally in the design and I'm not exaggerating when I say you chould have gazillions of free bytes in one profile, while the fs thinks it needs another
[17:14:53] <Khepra> *could
[17:15:21] <Khepra> the best part is there's no way out save for trying to add another physical disk and then <something> and rebalance chunk by chunk manually.
[17:15:32] <PMT> Hurray :D
[17:16:14] <Khepra> but even that won't help if you ran out of "unallocated", so the FS can't allocate a single byte for metadata needed during rebalance. you're dun goof'd. and there's terrabytes in raid1 chunks you can no longer use because one disk failed and the fs degraded into "single"

[18:15:27] <xx> jelly: I corrected myself
[18:16:05] <xx> basically if package1 had some depends or recommends installed, that were also suggests of package2, then those dependencies would not get removed upon uninstall of package1
[18:18:19] <somiaj> yes, aptitude can search based off of dep-type
[18:18:54] <somiaj> Though following depend changes is a little more difficult. This situation you describe does happen, but is often rare, and is hd space really that needed?
[18:19:15] <somiaj> you can also use apt logs to get a full list of what was installed and compare that if needed
[18:19:40] <xx> it's a bit annoying to have packages that I don't need, so I prefer to keep a clear system. Plus it is recommended by the bullseye upgrade guide to remove unneeded packages
[18:20:20] <xx> surely I'm not the first person wanting to find a command that would generate a list of packages that are only a suggests of some other packages
[18:20:26] <somiaj> The recommendation is more third party stuff, but anyways, to me this is a cost vs gains problem, and the gains usually aren't worth the cost.
[18:20:49] <somiaj> hence why aptitude has dep-type to search for
[18:21:15] <somiaj> but in this case it isn't 'package that is only suggested', because if that was true, it wouldn't have been installed by default.
[18:21:31] <xx> but it was installed as recommend by some other package

[19:16:52] <ioxzev1z> Napalm, iptables is deprecated in favour of nftables
[19:16:57] <ioxzev1z> The latter IMHO being better.
[19:17:07] <xx> iptables interface will be here forever
[19:17:18] <xx> no need to learn nft
[19:17:19] <ioxzev1z> Also GUI for nftables isn't really needed, very simple configuratio0n
[19:17:37] <ioxzev1z> xx, nft is the successor to iptables, even if iptables is here for the next 100 years
[19:18:05] <xx> I'm stating that for all practical purposes, one can ignore the existence of nftables
[19:18:37] <xx> and docker, podman, lxc, ... all depend on iptables and not nftables

[19:20:02] <ioxzev1z> The reason why everything is backwards compatible with literally everything else since 1980 is because people don't want to move on. NFT, for all intents and purposes, replaces iptables. Note even https://wiki.debian.org/iptables "NOTE: iptables is being replaced by nftables starting with Debian Buster".
[19:20:32] <ioxzev1z> xx, do you use systemd? That replaces the old sysv stuff
[19:20:55] <xx> ioxzev1z: unlike nftables, systemd conflicts with sysv
[19:21:00] <xx> hence it was all or nothing
[19:21:09] <xx> whereas nftables can simply be ignored
[19:21:37] <ansgar> xx: systemd runs those strange sysvinit init scripts just fine (with the limitations that such scripts have)
[19:21:38] <xx> blame the nftables devs for it
[19:21:58] <xx> if it was me, I would have decided to make it conflict with iptables, and force everyone to upgrade
