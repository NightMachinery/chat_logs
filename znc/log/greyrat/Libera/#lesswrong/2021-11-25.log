[04:15:33] <gwern> I'm definitely wondering if it's going to get the second season given how bad the reaction is. netflix of course only cares about viewership/retention and its internal metrics, but the reaction has to affect that
[04:25:19] <Betawolf> Are there any _good_ live action remakes of anime? I'm struggling to think of any. _Death Note_ was definitely cringeworthy.
[04:26:07] <dv^_^> Just wait until we get netflixed lain
[04:26:40] <Betawolf> I can't remember much about the GitS remake, which either means it was fine/meh or so bad I've repressed it.
[04:27:32] <gwern> Betawolf: I thought _battle angel alita_ was better than the manga
[04:27:40] <Betawolf> Dragonball and The Last Airbender were painful
[04:27:54] <Betawolf> Hmm, I've not seen that in either form.
[04:28:09] <gwern> are we only counting western movies here? if you include japanese, there are plenty of successful ones. the _rurouni kenshin_ trilogy was good
[04:28:27] <gwern> and the japanese _death note_ live actions are well-regarded. I only saw the first one, I think, but it was good
[04:28:56] <Betawolf> I was thinking of the Netflix one.
[04:28:58] <gwern> I also hear that the wachowski _speed racer_ is criminally underrated
[04:34:08] <shawwwn> Speed racer be like "Meanwhile, a secret meeting was being held secretly"

[04:37:41] <ggreer> eg: in the anime, faye valentine uses her sex appeal to her advantage. you can't have a show do that today
[04:38:49] <shawwwn> why not?
[04:38:55] <ggreer> the woke crowd would hate it
[04:39:39] <shawwwn> Cowboy bebop is far too overrated anyway, so a little more hate is probably a good thing
[04:39:47] <ggreer> the fight scenes really annoyed me though. you have to make it clear that spike & jet aren't magically dodging bullets. have the shooters be shocked or stunned when one of their comrades is taken out of commission in a weird way (like having a coin kicked at their head). that gives spike a plausible amount of time to rush them

[05:34:50] <shawwwn> Random interesting question: On average, how many birthdays is a person likely to experience? I.e. number of birthday parties attended for family and friends.
[05:34:51] <shawwwn> Dunbar's number suggests an upper limit, and the lower limit is easily computable. I wonder if there's an average. https://twitter.com/theshawwn/status/1463689969252376578

[05:38:19] <gwern> if you have 300 acquaintainces by dunbar's number, then they all must have a birthday during each year (aside from the occasional leap year birth but you have <1 such acquaintance on average since they happen only 1/(4*365) of the time). so that's 300 per year. you have a life expectancy of ~75 starting from your birth where you could be said to 'attend' anything, so that's 75*300 = 22,500...
[05:38:25] <gwern> ...possible birthdays. clearly, you attend far fewer than you could (asides from Gregarious Georg, who uses social media and an unlimited first class ticket to attend 3,000 birthdays a year and should not be included in analyses)
[05:39:45] <gwern> and of course, you have a lower limit of 0, since you can simply never attend a birthday party but there's no way to attend negative parties

[05:42:47] <gwern> I don't really see how to calculate a good estimate beyond that... birthday practices differ so widely. some families or groups will celebrate a lot, others will celebrate only kids birthdays kindergarten-highschool, etc
[05:43:32] <gwern> for example, I learned that in some areas the day of your birthday / year is considered a 'special' birthday. if you're born on January 31st, your 31st birthday is supposed to be a big bash.
[05:43:40] <gwern> I'd never heard of that before
[05:43:55] <gwern> one feels bad for the kids born on the first!
[05:44:28] <gwern> ("did I get a big special party for mine?" "you sure did" "I don't remember it" "yes, well, you were still having trouble focusing your eyes past 5 feet")

[08:59:43] <nshepperd2> probably it would be better if instead of being a REPL it had a 'sync' button which does some kind of ai-complete static analysis to figure out which cells should be re-executed to make the vm state the same as if you did "restart and run all"

[10:13:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh that's actually much worse
[10:13:20] <feep[work]> really, the part I don't understand is how you can defend php despite your sense of style
[10:13:31] <feep[work]> its stdlib has like three or four different naming conventions going at once!

[10:15:28] <feep[work]> did you learn something even worse first, somehow
[10:15:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> I learned C first, and then C++, and then Java (sort of? just enough to write some toy graphics-processing and GUI shit), and then Objective C, and then PHP
[10:15:49] <feep[work]> hm okay
[10:15:53] <feep[work]> yeah that also makes sense
[10:17:22] <med> goodness.
[10:17:33] <feep[work]> - I mean, the thing that irks me about php is that like, none of its shittiness is *necessary* for it to be the language it is. clean up the stdlib, fix globals, add explicit scoping, remove reference variables outright or at least give them special syntax, make the interpreter less braindamaged, and it can be a reasonable string templating language
[10:17:33] <Jayson_Virissimo> I went Java -> Ruby -> JavaScript. IMO, they are all fine in their own way.  Perhaps I have low standards and would have been satisfied with PHP had I learned that.
[10:17:46] <med> learning C, then C++ would've been challenging for me as a first language.
[10:17:55] <feep[work]> Jayson_Virissimo: I think if you passed through ruby, you shouuuldn't? have liked php by my model
[10:18:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> med: It's the right way. Everyone should do it like that

[10:19:00] <Jayson_Virissimo> I love Ruby and still choose do do most of my personal projects in it.
[10:19:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> And of course some JS...
[10:19:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> That was all later-ish though
[10:19:10] <feep[work]> forth is also a good starter because it has an exceedingly simple machine modeol.

[10:19:30] <feep[work]> and basically no features

[10:19:46] <Jayson_Virissimo> Actually, I've started looking into Lua lately, since my son plays Roblox and I'm trying to get him interested in programming.
[10:19:57] <med> Rust seems interesting.
[10:20:11] <feep[work]> lua is also good, it's a simple language so it only manages to cram in two critical design errors

[10:20:58] <feep[work]> forth is like, "Hello World" print
[10:21:12] <feep[work]> you read left to right, the computer reads left to right, you keep a stack of terms, the computer keeps a stack of terms
[10:21:31] <feep[work]> with a good interpreter you get like
[10:21:34] <feep[work]> > "Hello World"
[10:21:40] <feep[work]> ["Hello World"]
[10:21:40] <med> Wish I started with something like clisp
[10:21:44] <feep[work]> > "Hello World" print
[10:21:49] <feep[work]> Hello World
[10:21:49] <feep[work]> []
[10:21:55] <feep[work]> and this is eminently sensible

[10:23:04] <med> inb4 emacs vs vim
[10:23:08] <feep[work]> vim
[10:23:14] <med> nvim?
[10:23:22] <feep[work]> nah, vim.tiny
[10:23:26] <feep[work]> because it's preinstalled on minimal docker ubuntu images
[10:23:54] <med> nod
[10:23:56] <feep[work]> emacs is a good ide, maybe, but I already have an ide on this workstation
[10:24:21] <med> i liked debugging via gdb in emacs, but too many bells and whistles for me 
[10:24:38] <med> mostly trying to get career ready using nvim with toy programs now.
[10:24:53] <med> might play around with one of the gui editors if need be, seems to be a thing in the workforce.
[10:25:18] <med> vscode etc.
[10:25:20] <feep[work]> vim.tiny fills a hole: an editor that fits in

[10:35:43] <feep[work]> looking through the binary strings, it makes sense - this isn't a custom rewrite, it's a genuine vim that just wasn't compiled with many flags.

[13:42:32] <feep[work]> well, it's D with macros basically.

[16:23:52] <feep[work]> moonlander has the same issue
[16:24:21] <feep[work]> I noticed I have a habit of resting my wrists on the desk instead of holding them up, the advantage should either fix that or work with it

[16:25:08] <feep[work]> type down instead of up
[16:26:07] <feep[work]> the other splits are good entry ergo keyboards as I understand it, but I figured, if I was gonna buy an advantage eventually anyway I might as well do it now

[17:07:04] * feep[work] stares blithely
[17:07:12] <feep[work]> okay, I know this is a fact, but how can you be trans nonbinary?
[17:07:39] <feep[work]> I mean, on first blush it seems like a contradiction in terms? you either reject the gender binary or you don't
[17:07:58] <PapuaHardyNet> maybe you don't present as a specific gender
[17:08:12] <feep[work]> are you trans then?
[17:08:14] <PapuaHardyNet> but you have decided to have the genitals of another biological gender?
[17:08:26] <feep[work]> -- but that's not trans. trans is about gender, not sex.
[17:08:45] <PapuaHardyNet> trans enby's are very popular though
[17:08:49] * feep[work] sighs
[17:08:55] <feep[work]> I know this is a "big-tent trans" thing
[17:09:00] <feep[work]> ain't gotta like it tho
[17:09:28] <PapuaHardyNet> if everyone is trans, no one is. :)
[17:09:33] <feep[work]> trans is becoming enby plus medical system treatment judo
[17:09:37] <dv^_^> so why are enbies so heckin cute?
[17:09:54] <feep[work]> I mean
[17:10:05] <feep[work]> androgyny is cute?
[17:10:05] <PapuaHardyNet> that's begging the question :<
[17:10:13] <feep[work]> yeah that's almost definitional
[17:11:05] <feep[work]> if I wanted to deconstruct it further, it's the uncomfortable association of cuteness and youth, and the fact that kids are sexually undeveloped, so it follows if you aim at androgyny, you arrive at "sexually undeveloped" ie. cute.
[17:11:39] <feep[work]> but absolutely nobody wants to open that can of worms
[17:12:00] <PapuaHardyNet> trying to look cute as an old person is not a recipe for success, that is for sure
[17:12:05] * dv^_^ closes the can
[17:12:31] <feep[work]> let's just enjoy the cuteness~
[17:13:05] <feep[work]> I think the problem with big-tent trans is that we've hitched access to hormones and hrt and like
[17:13:16] <feep[work]> social permission to be andro, to trans as a medical/psychological issue
[17:13:22] <feep[work]> leading to a kind of definitional ratchet
[17:14:04] <feep[work]> really, ya'll should just enshrine morphological freedom as a human right.
[17:14:24] <feep[work]> that's where it's going anyways.

The emergence of a domestic growth of tobacco was
