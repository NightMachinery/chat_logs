[01:33:01] <faehis> Hi guys, can anyone recommend a good way to handle automatic Bitcoin payments? I don't want to use third parties, so I thought that I could make use of something like Bitcoin core and on top of that use a library to interact with the server to generate addresses and check transactions. Probably that is what I should do? Not too experienced with
[01:33:01] <faehis> Bitcoin myself to be able to know the concrete answer.
[01:35:13] <AndyS2> faehis: not sure what your usecase is and I've never used it myself, but there's software like btcpayserver.org that might be useful?
[01:35:52] <AndyS2> It's open source and can generate invoices, that's as far as I've interacted with an instance so far
[01:36:15] <faehis> At some point I have considered to use BTCPayServer. It seems relatively simple to use and interact with.
[01:36:38] <faehis> Though I wanted to challenge myself and try to handle payments "from scratch".
[01:37:28] <faehis> I guess you do that by generating a new address for each invoice and when a transaction is detected I do some stuff in the background to mark it as paid?
[01:38:16] <Guest-69> running one custom coded setup for accepting payments. using curl to getnewaddress, these are stored in db and checked for funded addresses every 3min. if any is funded, balance is added to corresponding user. using curl however it would be better to use zmq maybe to contact local bitcoin node running btc wallet, of course with authentication. no ports are visible to the outside and the serve is running a full node. if you need some specific information,
[01:39:23] <faehis> Hm I see.
[01:39:36] <faehis> Does Bitcoin core have a TCP or HTTP API to interact with?
[01:40:49] <Guest-69> i am using http api, which is contacted from python curl, the python script is running in while loop to constantly check for new funded addresses which are fetched from db, and they are stored in db after fetching with getnewaddress
[01:41:03] *** Joins: physiology (~physiolog@199-48-94-89.rochmnaa.metronetinc.net)
[01:41:11] <belcher> faehis look up btcpayserver
[01:41:21] <belcher> its an open source project which does the thing you're asking for i think
[01:41:33] <belcher> oh sorry i just read the rest of your text
[01:41:57] <faehis> I know, but I want do it the "raw" way. So I am asking more about Bitcoin core to see how I can use it.
[01:42:18] <faehis> Guest-69: do you have a documentation to provide me with for the HTTP API?
[01:42:26] <Guest-69> well, if it can be called an http api. more like sending json rpc bitcoin commands via curl to bitcoin rpc port with authentication
[01:43:06] <faehis> Yes, that! I think you're on the right track Guest-69
[01:43:38] <faehis> I'm just unsure what to take a look at for documentation. I need something to get started with, right?
[01:44:06] <Guest-69> sure, let me dig up a link if i can find something interesting. think you're on the right track, this was coded from scratch.
[01:45:08] <faehis> That's what I wanted to do as well. I think it shouldn't be that difficult, and sounds like a fun approach to me!

[01:50:53] <Guest-69> couldn't find one exact link but this should get you started, https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/ , setup a bitcoin node - it can be pruned to accept bitcoin payments, have a default wallet and make sure to setup rpcport to be available only from localhost with authentication. a generic example to contact bitcoin json rpc would probably be something like this, curl --data-binary '{.....json.....}' http://user:pass@127.0.0.1:8332/ ..... i do not 
[01:52:04] <Guest-69> yes, that should get you started. there are also ready json rpc libs for bitcoin, python, c, php.. but depends on the language you're working in and if you would use them at all
[01:52:12] <faehis> Got it, I think!
[01:52:42] *** Joins: pyrorock (~Dont@46.136.35.110)
[01:52:44] <faehis> Could you explain to me the logic behind generating new addresses and verifying if the user has actually made the payment?
[01:52:56] <faehis> I should be able to figure it out from there then.
[01:53:49] <faehis> Like, let's say they click purchase. In my backend I generate a new address. And then?

[01:58:37] <Guest-69> for a simple example, i would save the address in db, together with time, and user id who generated it, and if you wish and if your system works like that you save the required amount to be paid. then, you would need to use an rpc command, for example i use 'listreceivedbyaddress' to list balances from the address in db, if anything is there also check for tx id, once tx id has 1 confirmation fund the account that is written in db. there should be more c
[01:59:35] <Guest-69> or wait for 10 confirmations if you wish, its up to you. also i am using getrawtransaction and decodetranscation i believe, been a while since its coded

[02:00:48] *** Quits: pyrorock (~Dont@46.136.35.110) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[02:00:52] <Guest-69> for example, if you fund your users in USD to the account, then you also calculate the amount from the current rate which you can fetch from multiple exchanges and get the average for them
[02:02:07] <faehis> I see!
[02:02:26] <Guest-69> listreceivedbyaddress will return you a txid, and amount. check it for more information in reference on developers.b..
[02:03:42] <Guest-69> also note, there is additional coding needed if you wish to handle multiple payments to single address or simply one address - one payments, others get ignored. after you fund the payment to user, mark the tx paid in db so it is not checked anymore by cron
[02:03:47] *** Joins: pyrorock (~Dont@46.136.35.110)
[02:04:25] <faehis> I understand now!
[02:04:59] <faehis> To get this HTTP API up, all I need is to install and run Bitcoin core binaries? Correct?
[02:05:03] <Guest-69> sorry, that did not sound correctly, additional coding in case you want to allow user send multiple transactions to same address. but be careful for this when coding so you don't make a mistake somewhere
[02:05:29] <Guest-69> yes, and setup bitcoin.conf to open an rpcport, rpcuser and rpcpass
[02:05:47] <Guest-69> and rpchost
[02:06:00] <Guest-69> let me shoot you an example, moment
[02:06:04] <faehis> Got it, thanks a lot dude!
[02:06:14] <faehis> And yeah, I'll make sure to apply good security practices.
[02:08:11] <faehis> And sure :)

[02:10:51] <Guest-69> http://ix.io/3CCG this is an example bitcoin.conf that should give you a working rpc, make sure to allow ips which can connect to rpc, or remove the line. but its a good security practice, probably not needed while not in production
[02:11:34] *** Joins: pyrorock (~Dont@46.136.35.110)
[02:11:48] <Guest-69> of course replace the ip, with 127.0.0.1, you might want to do that :)

[02:14:43] <faehis> Doesn't seem difficult at all then. Thank you for providing me with all of this information, it really helps! Also, I am not required to use the Bitcoin core GUI, correct? As I prefer to do everything via the command line.

[02:17:35] <Guest-69> no problems :) you do not have to use bitcoin core gui, there are prebuilt binaries for bitcoin-cli,bitcoind,bitcointx and others which will get you started. bitcoind is the daemon, bitcoin-cli is for communicating with the daemon. just read the man, that's the part you have to do on your own. or you can compile bitcoin yourself, run it in docker or whatever way you like. MAKE SURE to check file signatures after download with official pgp key. np :)

[13:20:05] <JPT> I regret using a P2SH address since coinb.in does not seem to support those. Now I'm in a new rabbit hole of manually crafting transactions with a cold, offline bitcoin-qt
[13:22:08] <JPT> Wait, nevermind.
[13:22:17] <JPT> I guess I did mix something up :D
[13:23:09] <s17> coinb.in really helped me earlier this week for fixing a mistaken transaction
[13:23:33] <s17> and it involved at least 1 P2SH ;)
[13:26:13] <JPT> Big oof. I just learned about the redeem scripts. I guess I now know how to do this.
[13:26:35] <JPT> I'm so glad that my backup strategy contains everything I need
[13:31:30] <JPT> Yup, it worked. Time to sit back and relax. ^_^

[13:40:29] <JPT> Also, this would be a question: Is losing the redeem script an inrecoverable action?
[13:41:13] <belcher> pretty much
[13:41:34] *** Joins: hqdruxn08_ (~hqdruxn08@cpe-66-68-166-214.austin.res.rr.com)
[13:41:46] <JPT> So even with the address 3... and the private key, you would have no chance to recover the coins? That's a big gotcha.
[13:41:48] <belcher> i would not recommend storing coins the way you are, the vast majority of people should just use a proper software wallet which deals with all the stuff youre dealing with like redeemscripts
[13:42:05] <belcher> with a proper wallet you can just backup the seed phrase and thats all you need
[13:42:22] <JPT> Technically, I used bitcoin-qt to put everything into the wallet.dat, I just didn't like the idea of downloading the whole chain.
[13:42:25] *** Joins: yanmaani (~yanmaani@gateway/tor-sasl/yanmaani)
[13:42:39] <belcher> JPT if you have the private key then yes you can rederive the redeemscript in most situations (the only situation you cant is for some multisig wallets)
[13:42:59] <belcher> JPT then use a wallet like electrum which has seed phrases and everything else, but doesnt required downloading the whole chain
[13:43:22] <JPT> Noted for future use :-)
[13:43:45] <JPT> The way I did handle my coins is obviously not beginner friendly at all.
[13:44:56] <belcher> nor expert friendly, a true expert wouldnt add a lot of risk to their setup for no benefit

[13:46:15] <JPT> I agree, I guess I won't keep it the way it was. There were moments where I was fairly nervous whether things actually go the right way.
[13:47:03] <JPT> On the other hand: I was aware of the potential risk and given how much of value was involved, it fit my risk tolerance.

[20:43:22] <Guest70> Hi I do not understand this lightning network book by andreas statement - "If Alice wants to send 30k satoshi to Bob, both would create  a  new  version  of  their  commitment transactions which would now pay 70k satoshi to Alice and 30k satoshi to Bob. By encoding a new balance for Alice and Bob, the new commitment transactions are the means by
[20:43:23] <Guest70> which a payment is “sent” across the channel."
[20:43:45] <Guest70> how do you get 70k from 30k?

[21:01:30] <Guest70> It is in the last part of this section
[21:02:29] <Guest70> All that happened was Alice setup a payment channel with Bob and she also made a refund commitment transaction. But then 30k and 70k come out of nowhere?

[21:17:00] <z0d> yep, initial payment channel was 100k, so when 30k moved to the other side of the channel, a new commitment transaction was created to account for that if either side wants to force close the channel.
[21:18:18] *** Quits: pyrorock (~Dont@46.136.35.110) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[21:18:51] <Guest70> Ok so since Alice wants to send 30k from her initial balance of 100k, 100k - 30k = 70k and she does it with a newer commitment transaction
[21:19:55] <z0d> yes.  the commitment transaction is how both sides can "settle up" on chain if needed.  So, initially the fair close was "Alice gets 100k, Bob gets 0", but after the 30k transaction is made, the new fair close becomes "Alice gets 70k, Bob gets 30k"
[21:20:34] <Guest70> I see thank you

[23:09:20] <Guest70> Thank you
[23:11:43] <Guest70> Now I am confused by this statement from the book - Usually, the commitment transaction has at least two outputs, paying each channel partner. We change this to add a timelock delay and a revocation secret to one of the payments. The timelock prevents the owner of the output from spending it immediately once the commitment transaction is included
[23:11:43] <Guest70> in a block. The revocation secret allows either party to immediately spend that payment, bypassing the timelock.
[23:12:01] <Guest70> I thought the commitment transaction was not included in a block since it is done off chain?
[23:12:46] <Guest70> Unless they mean once the last payment in the channel takes place with the last commitment transaction, then it gets included in a block?

[23:14:18] <z0d> The commitment transaction is not normally included in a block, EXCEPT if one of the channel partners uses it to "force close" the channel
[23:15:01] <z0d> And, in the case that they channel partner commits a "revoked" transaction (one that you have the revocation secret for already), then the other party can sweep the funds.  This is the penalty for trying to cheat.

[23:15:51] <z0d> but you would only send the commitment transaction to the blockchain as a step in closing the channel (either collaboratively or non-collaboratively)
[23:16:12] <Guest70> Ok thank you for the clarification
[23:16:50] <Guest70> I have a hard time with Andres' way of explaining things sometimes.

[23:17:28] <z0d> try this - https://www.derpturkey.com/revocable-transactions-with-ln-penalty/
[23:17:50] <Guest70> Oh a link with some pictures nice :)
[23:18:44] <Guest70> Even mastering bitcoin I thought was way to technical stuff went over my head
[23:19:16] <z0d> for me, it takes reading and rereading and then discussing and then rereading.
[23:19:26] <Guest70> Agreed I probably have to do the same
