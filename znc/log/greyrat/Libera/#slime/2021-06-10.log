[04:32:25] <luis> dieggsy: all those streams that pjb mentions point to SWANK streams when you launch Lisp with M-x slime. Are you perhaps connecting SLIME to an already running process?
[04:34:33] <dieggsy> luis: i think i just mixed up slime and slynk as i had both open, i'll take another look
[04:34:45] <dieggsy> er, sly
[04:37:17] <pjb> dieggsy: does slynk us a different backend than swank?
[04:37:23] <pjb> s/us/use
[04:37:57] <dieggsy> slynk is to sly as swank is to slime
[04:38:13] <pjb> oh ok.
[04:38:18] <dieggsy> AFAIK both of the former are literally based on the latter though
[04:38:37] <dieggsy> like, to the point where i feel like a lot of it is "changed the name and went with it'
[04:38:55] <dieggsy> idk if they ever merge from slime but they do have separate development though

[04:39:00] <pjb> Perhaps there's a ~/.slynk.lisp file and some  (slynk:*default-worker-thread-bindings* SLYNK:*MACROEXPAND-PRINTER-BINDINGS* SLYNK::*INSPECTOR-VERBOSE-PRINTER-BINDINGS* SLYNK::*INSPECTOR-PRINTER-BINDINGS* slynk::*backtrace-printer-bindings* #+#.(cl:if (cl:find-symbol "*SLDB-PRINTER-BINDINGS*" "SLYNK") '(:and) '(:or)) slynk:*sldb-printer-bindings*) ?
[04:48:28] <luis> So, I expect (values swank-repl::*globally-redirect-io* swank-loader::*started-from-emacs*) to yield :STARTED-FROM-EMACS and T
[04:50:39] <dieggsy> luis: M-x slime, that original list shows me a swank/gray stream for the first stream, the rest are sysnonym-stream ? 
[04:51:05] <luis> that's fine. The synonym streams point to SWANK symbols, right?
[04:51:32] <dieggsy> luis: and yeah, i can confirm :started-from-emacs and t for those values
[04:51:40] <dieggsy> luis: not sure how to find out?
[04:52:08] <luis> my *debug-io* evaluates to #<SYNONYM-STREAM :SYMBOL SWANK::*CURRENT-DEBUG-IO* {1004349253}>
[04:52:15] <dieggsy> still, something like (excl:run-shell-command "echo hey") in allegro shows output in *inferior-lisp-buffer*
[04:52:47] <dieggsy> luis: ah. uh. nope, it's #<SYNONYM-STREAM @ #x10027806e2)
[04:52:56] <dieggsy> whoops s/)/>
[04:52:56] <luis> OK, Allegro prints those differently.
[04:53:22] <luis> dieggsy: you can check with (synonym-stream-symbol *debug-io*) then
[04:53:42] <dieggsy> luis: oh yeah, that does point to swank
[04:54:05] <luis> dieggsy: so the issue there is that echo is writing directly to stdout
[04:54:36] <dieggsy> luis: hm. is there no way to have that output show up in the repl buffer then?
[04:54:55] * luis boots his work laptop
[04:54:59] <dieggsy> i'm not sure i understand the distinction between "directly to stdout" vs ..... i sort of assumed slime was handling STDOUT in a special way? but
[04:55:09] <dieggsy> ...it's all a bit hazy to me
[04:55:26] <dieggsy> ....end of the day, i'd just like all output to be on the repl buffer. it's a bit weird to have a separate buffer that gets some output

[05:00:36] <luis> dieggsy: does (excl:run-shell-command "echo hey" :output *standard-output*) work for you? It doesn't for me on Windows.
[05:01:34] <dieggsy> luis: it doesn't. I think the command expects :output to be a stream bound to a FD
[05:06:00] <luis> dieggsy: in that case, maybe M-x slime-redirect-inferior-output works
[05:06:33] <dieggsy> Oooooooohhhhh
[05:06:56] <dieggsy> that did seem to do it!
[05:09:32] <luis> the existence of two separate buffers is unfortunate, I might fix that someday!
[05:10:57] <dieggsy> luis: ah. my brain is now connecting the dots. "how did you know about that?" now i know heh. thanks for slime then :)
[05:14:14] <dieggsy> this function does not in fact exist in sly... i'd say this tips the scales in slime's favor heh
[05:15:38] <luis> dieggsy: Jo√£o may have overlooked that when he reworked the mrepl contrib. There's some good ideas in there, it'd be nice to merge them back.
[05:16:00] <dieggsy> Maybe i'll create an issue there then
[05:16:46] <luis> Yeah, can't hurt.
