[00:26:39] <buttsbot> Twitter - NetflixGeeked - what you need to know about COWBOY BEBOP  🚀 based on the beloved 1998 anime 🚀 stars John Cho, Mustafa Shakir and Daniella...
[00:26:41] <manicennui> Um.
[00:27:43] <manicennui> Why can't Americans just watch animation
[00:27:44] <manicennui> ?
[00:30:57] <prussian> because cartoons are for kids, duh?
[00:31:20] <dasm> and internet is for pr0n?
[00:31:30] <prussian> how did you know?
[00:31:48] <dasm> i've heard songs about that. they are all over the internet
[00:39:36] <manicennui> Is there any chance this will be anything but disappointing?
[00:40:21] <dasm> manicennui: there is a slight hope.
[00:40:31] <dasm> like with GITS
[00:40:33] * dasm runz
[00:40:36] <manicennui> I get why Hollywood makes bad remakes and such (people will buy tickets based on name recognition), but do bad remakes help sell streaming subscriptions?
[00:41:01] <manicennui> I suppose I know the answer to that.

[00:52:36] <gerikson> haha yeah
[00:52:58] <bkero> There are some fun ones.
[00:53:12] <bkero> I've been going through https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drops_of_God recently
[00:53:13] <buttsbot> Drops of God - Wikipedia
[00:58:20] <manicennui> Shizuku learns that, in order to take ownership of his legacy, he must correctly identify, and describe in the manner of his late father, thirteen wines, the first twelve known as the "Twelve Apostles" and the thirteenth known as the "Drops of God"
[00:58:24] <manicennui> That does sound interesting.
[00:58:43] <cb> i want to make an evangelion reference

[01:01:20] <buttsbot> Moriarty the Patriot - Wikipedia
[01:01:22] <manicennui> That sounds wild.
[01:01:35] <manicennui> "They scheme together to kill Albert's cruel blood related brother, also named William, burn down the family estate, and then start a new life together aimed at using illegal means to destroy the class system which had plagued the country for centuries."
[01:02:36] <manicennui> Is that similar to Moriarty's role in the books?
[01:08:56] <manicennui> Despite having more adult themes, a lot of anime seems to feature high school students.

[02:59:25] <bkero> Plex? For music?
[02:59:28] <indigo> Yeah, for music
[02:59:48] <bkero> "self-hosted Spotify-like thing"
[02:59:49] <indigo> Apparently there is https://plexamp.com/
[02:59:50] <buttsbot> Plexamp - Love your music!
[02:59:54] <bkero> It sounds like you want mt-daapd or firefly

[03:00:37] <gwozniak> ``A beautiful Plex music player for audiophiles, curators, and hipsters.'' At least they're honest about it
[03:02:31] <indigo> I'll check those out; thanks bkero
[03:02:46] <Xe> requires a plex pass
[03:03:00] <Xe> in case that's super relevant to you that is
[03:03:56] <indigo> Sure, I'm taking the total price of the solution into account
[03:04:20] <indigo> Basically some combination of UX, simplicity, and price
[03:05:05] <bkero> Ampache
[03:06:01] <indigo> I'm also very curious to see if anyone has actually *tried* any of these options
[03:07:55] <gwozniak> I've never heard of any of them before
[03:07:59] <indigo> Funkwhale looks interesting too
[03:08:20] <gwozniak> "Ampache" (oof) has been around for 20 years and this is the first I've heard of it
[03:09:55] <bkero> I ran Ampache for a good half-decade.

[03:10:59] <cb> its basically a less crumbly airsonic compatible dingus
[03:16:49] <gwozniak> I had a dlna server running in my place for a while, until I gave up on it because it was so flaky

[03:21:18] <dmc> pulseaudio-dlna seems to have stopped working for my Sonos speakers
[03:22:00] <bkero> I've basically switched to Snapcast for streaming audio at my house. Shit works well.
[03:22:04] <dmc> quite possible Sonos managed to lock down their systems even more
[03:22:13] <bkero> The only downside is no obvious way to stream system audio from Windows.
[03:22:25] <bkero> But I just need to make better software decisions to have that not be a problem.
[03:22:59] <dmc> and hardware ^^

[03:55:47] <manicennui> It's amazing that this MrBeast guy has 20 million subscribers.
[03:56:29] <manicennui> He had Brian Shaw on recently. It seemed very lame.
[03:57:03] <manicennui> Like he just has a lot of money to throw around and has people do things for money, but he doesn't even put much thought into it.
[03:57:14] <gwozniak> I am so unaware of basically everything related to popular YouTube personalities
[03:57:40] <manicennui> I wasn't aware of this guy. I follow Brian Shaw because I like strongman lifting.
[03:58:50] <manicennui> He had Shaw "lift a car", but it was really just a lever under the back tires, and you can tell it wasn't a challenge for Shaw because he did 10 reps.
[03:59:28] <manicennui> Then he had some other random guy bench a bar with baskets of money hanging on it to win the money.
[03:59:41] <manicennui> The guy basically couldn't do it and Shaw helped him.
[03:59:53] <manicennui> And he gave the guy one of the baskets of money anyways.
[04:00:05] <manicennui> Wasn't even very entertaining, and he seems a bit annoying.
[04:01:28] <manicennui> Guy is clearly making a ton of money from YT though.
[04:01:33] <cb> gwozniak: me too, it's 99% repulsivce
[04:02:22] <manicennui> I think there is a lot of amazing content on YT, including many of the popular people.
[04:02:38] <manicennui> Most of the annoying people are gaming streamers and such.
[04:04:33] <manicennui> Of course YT doesn't recommend any of the right wing idiots to me anymore, so I'm probably missing out on some real assholes.

[12:53:04] <Brekkjern> There's not even a waitlist here :S
[12:53:10] <Brekkjern> You either get a spot or you don't
[12:53:32] <Brekkjern> I've got scripts polling the page to notify me of there being free spots
[12:53:58] <_ak_> have the scripts add yourself into the class as well! i doubt anyone can beat that

[12:56:35] <Brekkjern> This script actually

[12:57:15] <Brekkjern> I could probably improve it a lot, but... eh...
[12:59:03] <_ak_> that's cool! never thought to use ps for such things
[12:59:29] <_ak_> for a similar problem i have websrabed with beautifulsoup or scrapy
[13:00:14] <_ak_> and then implemented the clicking portion with selenium
[13:00:41] <Brekkjern> Yeah. I could do that too, but I don't have any example flows to use to make it
[13:01:06] <_ak_> i've also used urlwatch (just for notifications)
[13:01:15] <Brekkjern> I can't click through the registration as reference for the automation :S
[13:02:34] <_ak_> can you try getting the example flow from another class you can click your way into and register for?
[13:03:18] <_ak_> i imagine you can modify the css selector / xpath enough to get the class you're looking for
[13:03:21] <Brekkjern> Nope. None available for me to use as reference
[13:03:29] <_ak_> brilliant
[13:03:34] <Brekkjern> I can get through the first step of registration, but not the later ones
[13:03:50] <Brekkjern> Actually, I can't even get through the first step
[13:04:19] <Brekkjern> Brb
[13:04:49] <_ak_> well, that would be cool -- i know folks who have used such ways to buy things that are hard-to-get (always sold out)

[13:07:47] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[13:08:14] <Brekkjern> Bleh... It seems I need to learn Scheme for this class..
[13:10:52] <Brekkjern> At least it seems like the instructors know their shit though
[13:15:31] <Geekingfrog> I found that classes with good instructors were usually worth it, even if the topic was meh at first. Compared to cool topics but crappy teachers.
[13:16:15] <Brekkjern> The class is called "Functional Programming", so...
[13:16:57] <Brekkjern> It's the first 2000 level class I am taking, so I am not sure how it will be
[13:19:44] <gerikson> Brekkjern: back in 1993 KTH tried teaching 1st year students Scheme as intro programming
[13:19:51] <Brekkjern> lol
[13:19:53] <gerikson> it broke the poor bastards
[13:20:15] <gerikson> it was a perfect storm
[13:20:22] <Geekingfrog> KTH ?
[13:20:40] <gerikson> tehy also moved from 8 exam periods / year to 4
[13:20:44] <gerikson> *3 even

[13:24:44] <Brekkjern> It's concise to the point of being obtuse

[13:25:41] <gerikson> nb this was *engineering*, not CS
[13:26:27] <Brekkjern> I think I'm moving more in the direction of CS, but since I'm just signing up to what sounds interesting and is available to me, there's no real direction to it

[18:35:48] <gwozniak> It's just as simple as running your own mail server
[18:35:49] <Brekkjern> I love that so much :P
[18:36:37] <gwozniak> I do feel a bit sorry for the guy who made the comment.  I heard something from him recently where he said something to effect of "I was young and stupid"
[18:37:14] <gerikson> Dropbox market cap: $12.25B
[18:37:16] <companion_cube> high on unix
[18:37:34] <companion_cube> I wouldn't blame the guy, it's just a common mindset
[18:37:36] <gerikson> is there anything you can't do with curl and FTP, I think not!
[18:37:48] <companion_cube> well rsync beats them both
[18:37:52] <companion_cube> so rsync should be worth 12B
[18:38:24] <prussian> so it seems
[18:39:30] <prussian> as far as I know, dropbox is profitable, somehow.
[18:39:54] <Brekkjern> They fleece businesses
[18:40:23] <prussian> I don't understand why they have filesystem specific requirements on linux though.
[18:40:24] <buttsbot> Linux distributions are just zodiac signs for nerds.
[18:41:32] <prussian> honestly, if I wanted cloud storage, i'd probably just use S3.
[18:41:59] <Brekkjern> Yes. You can implement this quite trivially with S3
[18:42:05] <Brekkjern> :D
[18:42:22] <companion_cube> I think the challenge is reconciliation of changes made offline?
[18:42:26] <prussian> I just know is S3 is cheap. I throw a ton of shit in it and the bill for it is a rounding error at work
[18:42:33] <companion_cube> you edit stuff in the train/plane, and then it has to sync with other changes
[18:42:40] <companion_cube> and no one likes merge conflicts
[18:43:25] <prussian> oh, dropbox does this?

[18:44:21] <buttsbot> Rewriting the heart of our sync engine - Dropbox
[18:44:23] <Brekkjern> Dropbox is a folder on your device that you can work inside, and the contents of that folder is synced between all your devices and a version in the cloud
[18:45:13] <Brekkjern> They also keep older versions of files so you can grab one if you overwrite or delete something
[18:45:42] <prussian> in defense of s3, it has a versioning thing too.
[18:45:46] <prussian> cool
[18:46:12] <Brekkjern> Yeah, but you can't just right-click a file in a folder and say "I want an older version"
[18:46:13] <companion_cube> syncthing does that too
[18:46:26] <companion_cube> (ah, not the see past versions, but it does try to solve conflicts)
[18:47:57] <Brekkjern> I can also right click a file in that folder, and select "Copy dropbox link" and paste it here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/i394lbvz0iek6xx/2gxmux2.gif?dl=0

[18:51:22] <companion_cube> there's a free plan, right?
[18:51:24] <Brekkjern> But speaking of NSFW, I'm gonna skidaddle on home
[18:51:27] <Brekkjern> Yes
[18:51:40] <prussian> see ya
[18:51:51] <prussian> companion_cube: I too, use syncthing
[18:52:12] <companion_cube> I could see if $SO is interested in a common free account
[18:52:44] <prussian> I also use the free google drive thing too
[18:52:56] <prussian> since it just works with gvfs I guess.
[18:58:20] <gwozniak> So I'm building our product with a different compiler version and I don't think that some of my coworkers ever check warnings, because there are soooo many of them in our code
[19:01:05] <prussian> nice...
[19:01:23] <prussian> instead I just have #pragma blah blah disable warning ...pop etc
[19:01:27] <prussian> everywhere
[19:16:29] <gwozniak> Think I will have to bring this up in the team meeting tomorrow
[19:16:51] <prussian> what kind of warnings are you getting?
[19:17:18] <gwozniak> Or thursday, or whatever day it is
[19:17:22] <prussian> could just stick -Werror and annoy people lol
[19:18:02] <gwozniak> Can't do that since upstream code warns a lot too
[19:18:36] <prussian> weird...
[19:18:41] <gwozniak> "comparison of integer expressions of different signedness" "comparison is always false due to limited range of data type"
[19:18:43] <prussian> i mean, sorry.
[19:18:44] <gwozniak> Stuff like this
[19:18:49] <gwozniak> Lots of it
[19:18:50] <prussian> comparison of integer expressions of different signedness is p bad.
[19:18:59] <gwozniak> yes, it's something that will burn you
[19:19:21] <prussian> damn...
[19:19:54] <prussian> well, going from 4.8 to 7.3 literally caused a crap ton of dangling cstr refs to blow up our code with sporadic issues.
[19:19:58] <gwozniak> It happens because the build produces so much output that unless you go looking, you won't see the warnings
[19:20:19] <prussian> that was, fun. including explaining why c_str() is dangerous to people who are my senior.
[19:20:35] <gwozniak> I happen to build in Emacs and look at the output, jumping to the warnings/errors
[19:20:50] <gwozniak> prussian: oh, lovely
[19:21:28] <gwozniak> And lots of unused variables in big functions (in our code)
[19:21:50] <prussian> nice...
[19:21:58] <gwozniak> Big functions seems bad, but in GCC/binutils, breaking them into smaller ones is sometimes worse
[19:22:08] <prussian> in my codebase, someone just made some macro to force "usage"
[19:22:12] <prussian> for those cases.
[19:22:19] <prussian> hard to say what the purpose is
[19:22:50] <prussian> favorite is still using a do { } while (false) as control flow.
[19:23:23] <Brekkjern> Isn't it possible to only warn when the offending code is from your files?
[19:23:25] <prussian> gwozniak: i'm sorry. sounds hell. I need to get off this c++ ride myself.
[19:23:27] <prussian> and just
[19:23:32] <prussian> never work or somethig.
[19:23:50] <prussian> Brekkjern: ya, you could attach per compilation unit.
[19:23:59] <prussian> depends on motivation and build system I suppose.
[19:24:41] <gwozniak> Brekkjern: not sure how I would go about doing that
[19:25:04] <Brekkjern> I dunno. I don't do C
[19:25:53] <Brekkjern> I just assume there must be a way to at least filter the output you are getting
[19:26:26] <WilhelmVonWeiner> I had an interview at DigitalOcean a while ago and i wanna ask you guys something
[19:27:11] <WilhelmVonWeiner> if you're told "write a service like bit.ly where different users get different addresses for the same url"
[19:27:13] <prussian> if you're using cmake... https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_sf/COMPILE_OPTIONS.html#prop_sf:COMPILE_OPTIONS
[19:27:13] <buttsbot> COMPILE_OPTIONS — CMake 3.21.1 Documentation
[19:27:20] <prussian> that would be an option.
[19:27:40] <prussian> or if the custom is all a separate target. target_compile_options is a choice
[19:27:42] <WilhelmVonWeiner> would you not expect to write a mapping between a user and their generated urls?
[19:27:59] <Brekkjern> WilhelmVonWeiner: Depends.
[19:28:32] <Brekkjern> Is it part of the spec?
[19:28:39] <WilhelmVonWeiner> EXACTLY
[19:28:51] <WilhelmVonWeiner> stupid interview question didn't even give me a spec
[19:29:02] <prussian> i... ya, what is the end goal I guess? could just hash over user, and then hash hash of user with url
[19:29:09] <prussian> there, unique user url?
[19:29:10] <prussian> idk
[19:29:29] <WilhelmVonWeiner> the answer was basically add some kind of salt like current unixtime or whatever to the hash function
[19:29:31] <companion_cube> scan the user's pupil and hash it into the URL
[19:29:37] <river> wow they're making a show of asimovs foundation
[19:29:51] <companion_cube> or ask for a blood sample
[19:29:52] <WilhelmVonWeiner>  prussian: users didn't even have usernames
[19:30:00] <prussian> ...idk then.
[19:30:00] <prussian> lol
[19:30:03] <Brekkjern> Using time could potentially give collisions
[19:30:07] <WilhelmVonWeiner> thats how poorly the question was defined i thought about all kinds of stuff that simply didn't matter
[19:30:13] <prussian> river: man, they must be desperate
[19:30:15] <prussian> for IP
[19:30:19] <gwozniak> Our build uses the configure/make approach, so changing the build on a per-file basis is a mess
[19:30:23] <WilhelmVonWeiner> Brekkjern: anything can give collisions! it's a 6-character long token!
[19:30:30] <Brekkjern> Yes
[19:30:37] <prussian> gwozniak: I am so sorry.
[19:30:39] <WilhelmVonWeiner> man digitalocean upset me and i can't get over how i was tricked and fooled
[19:30:45] <river> haha
[19:30:58] <prussian> so like, autotools, or literally custom ./configure with whatever custom header templating?
[19:31:15] <Brekkjern> I'm glad the interview questions I had were better :P
[19:31:28] <gwozniak> It's the stuff from upstream, so changing it means future merge conflicts
[19:31:53] <prussian> i don't even remember what I was asked. I think someone said something about a build system made entirely in bash and asked me some really weirdly stupid linux admin stuff.
[19:32:04] <WilhelmVonWeiner> at least it made me start hammering through my copy of "Cracking the Coding Interview" even if i think i will cheese "devops" my entire life
[19:32:17] <WilhelmVonWeiner> hashicorp basically invented a job and gave me the keys
[19:32:18] <prussian> DevOops...
[19:32:40] <Brekkjern> DevSecOops
[19:32:48] <prussian> I read my resume and all I see is "DevOops" and then frown
[19:32:52] <prussian> realizing I am doomed
[19:33:03] <Brekkjern> Any other infixes we can add to DevSecOps?
[19:33:16] <prussian> uh.
[19:33:25] <prussian> I think devoops is dead. it's all about SRE now
[19:33:27] <prussian> whatever that is
[19:33:47] <prussian> SysDevSecOps?
[19:33:51] <companion_cube> software responsibility eviction
[19:33:56] <prussian> lol
[19:34:04] <Brekkjern> I'm sure Net would fit in there
[19:34:10] <prussian> ya
[19:34:19] <Brekkjern> DevSecNetChatGitOps
[19:34:19] <prussian> networking as code bro.
[19:34:31] <prussian> just making networking devops
[19:34:32] <prussian> simple as
[19:34:37] <cb> i'm kinda glad i'm far away from devops
[19:34:47] <WilhelmVonWeiner> prussian: the tech lead at my first job had the SRE book
[19:34:51] <prussian> nice.
[19:34:57] <companion_cube> trigger releases by a magic incantation on a slack channel
[19:35:00] <WilhelmVonWeiner> he still couldn't define it...
[19:35:15] <companion_cube> rollback deployements by yelling "ABORT! ABORT!" on the same channel
[19:35:19] <companion_cube> that seems nice
[19:35:37] <prussian> my first internship, some guy was like: whoa you only use linux? whoa. You have all these services on your VPS? whoa. and then i was shoehorned into it since.
[19:35:49] <prussian> companion_cube: damn.
[19:36:30] <prussian> sounds almost worse than UrbanCode Deploy somehow
[19:36:34] <prussian> somehow
[19:36:41] <companion_cube> that's sci-fi as far as I'm concerned
[19:36:56] <companion_cube> but surely "chat ops" or whatever isn't far from that
[19:37:05] <prussian> lmao
[19:37:09] <prussian> that's pretty funny though
[19:37:28] <companion_cube> need a quorum of 3 people yelling "abort" to rollback on a friday
[19:37:30] <prussian> you just need semantic analysis of your chat
[19:37:32] <companion_cube> and a D20 die roll
[19:37:41] <companion_cube> "fumble"
[19:37:47] <prussian> this is supremely humorous to me
[19:38:57] <WilhelmVonWeiner> "Chat Ops" has me rolling
[19:39:12] <companion_cube> I mean it'd be funm
[19:39:16] <companion_cube> fun*
[19:39:25] <companion_cube> I can imagine the bots have a narrative mode, too
[19:39:30] <prussian> so what happens when slack is down though.
[19:39:32] <WilhelmVonWeiner> semantic analysis + operation tooling = * hashicorp RockStar!! *
[19:39:37] <prussian> this
[19:39:43] <companion_cube> "@john tries to release on a friday, wish him luck!"
[19:39:50] <WilhelmVonWeiner> when slack is down your core network goes offline
[19:39:57] <prussian> do we have to have a backup irc network?
[19:39:59] <prussian> lol
[19:40:02] <prussian> probably...
[19:40:15] <companion_cube> how do you work without slack anyway
[19:40:18] <prussian> fuck. all the build infra at my place is all EC2 now.
[19:40:19] <prussian> so
[19:40:23] <companion_cube> go home and take a day off
[19:40:27] <companion_cube> how, you're already home? good
[19:40:28] <prussian> in 2021?
[19:40:40] <prussian> you switch to MS Teams instead, duh
[19:40:55] *** Quits: martian67 (~martian67@user/martian67) (Quit: "")
[19:41:11] <WilhelmVonWeiner> everyone at work was begging for slack over teams and i didnt get it, they're the same thing to me

[19:41:20] *** Joins: martian67 (~martian67@user/martian67)

[19:42:04] <prussian> we have teams where I am. it keeps saying I am "away"
[19:42:35] <WilhelmVonWeiner> same lol, i can't get it to stop except for clicking the window every 5 minutes
[19:43:29] <Brekkjern> Teams is just so ass that I have difficulty putting into words how bad it is
[19:43:35] <Geekingfrog> I think that can be automated? To simulate a click on the window every minutes.
[19:44:09] <Brekkjern> Get a rubber ducky and have it press F24 all day? :P
[19:44:29] <prussian> possibly unpopular, but at least teams has working file sharing unlike skype for business or whatever the fuck was before.
[19:44:44] <prussian> Lync
[19:44:46] <prussian> ya
[19:44:49] <prussian> same shit
[19:45:09] <prussian> Brekkjern: good idea.
[19:45:16] <prussian> there really is an F24?
[19:46:00] <Brekkjern> AFAIK, yes
[19:46:02] <WilhelmVonWeiner> yeah, i think the IBM Unsaver has them
[19:46:12] <WilhelmVonWeiner> (keyboard, i used to be really into those)
[19:47:10] <cb> as the local old computer enthuiast, don't take terminal keyboards from the terminals
[19:47:21] <cb> they made like a million ibm mainframe terminals except none of them have the keyboards

[19:53:04] <Geekingfrog> I wasn't aware of this new service beyond the headline a few days ago. And after reading this thread, that's all I'm going to bother checking.
[19:53:44] <WilhelmVonWeiner> we're moving a whole opensips, freeswitch etc deployment to AWS (idk why you would, but it's my job) so i'm like, inhaling all these services
[19:54:32] * Geekingfrog has been an aws slave for many many years now
[19:55:58] <WilhelmVonWeiner> any books on it or is it blogpost hell
[19:56:09] <Brekkjern> "Subnet group trashfiredb-subnet already exists."
[19:56:18] <Brekkjern> That gave me an audible laugh

[20:06:28] <manicennui> Bringing back Alfred Molina as Doctor Octopus is a pretty baller move.
[20:06:44] <manicennui> I assume Spider-Man fans are losing their minds.

[21:21:04] <buttsbot> SpaceX installed 29 Raptor engines on a Super Heavy rocket last night | Ars Technica
[21:22:45] <prussian> that's a lot of engines
[21:23:02] <dimadima> yes i don't know anything about rockets but damn
[21:23:26] <prussian> are the raptors the full flow staged combustion engines?
[21:24:22] <manicennui> Musk just stands there staring at the rocket saying, "More!"
[21:24:41] <prussian> i can't even imagine how they plumb that thing
[21:25:08] <prussian> surprising they don't seem to have the nozzles getting any fuel flow either.
[21:25:14] <prussian> hmm
[21:26:07] <prussian> cool engine...
[21:26:15] <prussian> wonder why they went with methane though
[21:26:21] <prussian> https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Raptor_Engine_Unofficial_Combustion_Scheme.svg
[21:26:57] <Geekingfrog> coming from Musk, I wouldn't be surprised if the drive behind that was more from "it would be could if we could" than any other more practical considerations
[21:27:25] <prussian> cool engine. wonder if it works.
[21:29:40] <prussian> RS-25 is fuel rich staged combustion, I know that much
[21:29:49] <prussian> wonder what goes on when they make these trade offs.
[21:30:22] <prussian> I'd think oxy rich air would be more corrosive than LOX. not sure though.
[21:35:13] <prussian> Geekingfrog: ya.... I'd hope there was some cost angle at least.
[21:37:19] <prussian> looks like the Blue Origin one is methane too...
[21:41:29] <prussian> I guess I'll ask the retired guy I know who worked on the turbopumps in the powerheads what he thinks.

[21:49:02] <companion_cube> :/ ffs

[21:50:56] <manicennui> “Someone from tiktok was uploading large amounts of shrek porn.”
[21:51:01] <prussian> is this real life?
[21:55:25] <prussian> we must own the libs, even when it is a complete stupid waste of time.
[21:56:44] <companion_cube> it's in the same vein as billboards with anti-choice ads :/
[22:00:12] <ngoldbaum> prussian: yes we must protect the lives of the unborn but only while we can persecute women, once they’re out into the world they’re on their own
[22:00:22] <prussian> so true.
[22:00:33] <prussian> radical individualism and tough love, no?
[22:00:44] <prussian> or well)
[22:00:47] <prussian> rugged
[22:19:02] <manicennui> But not for the poor corporations. They deserve our government's help.
[22:19:07] <manicennui> They deserve to make money.

[22:27:12] <buttsbot> An American Pakistanis first time on Devon street ... I'm flabbergasted : chicago
[22:28:45] <manicennui> A section of Devon Ave. has a high concentration of Indian and Pakistani people.
[22:30:22] <manicennui> "Devon's Desi corridor is one of the best-known and largest communities of its kind in North America. It exists mainly on Devon between Ravenswood Ave. and California Ave. South Asian shops, restaurants and grocery stores including the first location of Patel Brothers, that opened in 1974, abound along this strip, and it has become a popular tourist destination."
[22:31:10] <manicennui> "Devon Street's sidewalks are even speckled with the paan stains"
[22:38:20] <manicennui> I think this is one example of what separates cities like NYC and Chicago from most others in the US.
[22:39:33] <manicennui> And there are probably a dozen different ethnic areas like this in each city.
[22:40:14] <manicennui> Chicago also has a Chinatown, dense Mexican areas, a Thai/Vietnamese area, etc.
[23:08:22] <prussian> 13:49 < manicennui> Unless it is a company I don't like, then I'll screech about the free market.
[23:08:24] <prussian> so true.
