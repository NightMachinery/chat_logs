[17:21:59] <Gnuman> Hello, I'm having trouble getting ZNC working with libera when I request the server-time capability in my client. Essentially, I do "CAP REQ :server-time", then PASS+NICK+USER, then "CAP END". Everything works fine for a while, and I eventually close my client. Later, I start up my client again, and I can't send messages to libera anymore. I can still receive, but nothing goes out, not even JOIN commands. The only way to fix this ap
[17:21:59] <Gnuman> pears to be disconnecting from libera and then reconnecting. This is on ZNC 1.8.2 on debian
[17:22:55] <Gnuman> everything worked perfectly before I started asking for server-time
[17:23:02] *** Joins: Gnum4n (~gnum4n@user/gnuman)
[17:23:45] <Gnuman> where should I look to debug this issue? I tried manually sending "CAP END" to ZNC, thinking the ZNC->libera connection was in a bad state, but this also doesn't fix it.

[17:42:15] <BtbN> You're sending that zo ZNC, not the network
[17:43:00] <Gnuman> Yeah, that's the way it seems... is there a way to tell ZNC to send raw commands directly to the network?
[17:43:12] <MetaNova> [[Raw]]
[17:43:12] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Raw
[17:43:56] <Gnuman> ah, thanks. I'll try this out
[17:46:30] *** Quits: kurahaupo (~kurahaupo@115.69.27.211) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[17:47:19] <BtbN> Keep in mind that if you send a cap request to the network, ZNC needs to understand what it causes to be sent back
[17:47:22] <BtbN> otherwise thing will break
[17:47:56] <Gnuman> hmm.... If I send the CAP REQ before I even login to ZNC, doesn't that mean ZNC will know?
[17:48:25] <BtbN> That's assuming it has any idea about that capability and knows how to handle it
[17:48:30] <Gnuman> https://github.com/mnakama/flexim-go/blob/master/irc-client.go#L82-L92 <- these are the commands I'm sending to ZNC on connect
[17:48:32] <BtbN> in which case it'd probably request it itself anyway
[17:49:04] <Gnuman> I'm only requesting server-time, which ZNC appears to support (it was in the CAP LS 302 output)
[17:49:21] <BtbN> It supports it between clients and znc
[17:49:42] <Gnuman> *raw shows that ZNC is sending the "CAP END" to libera
[17:50:06] <Gnuman> even after I'm already connected (I disconnect my client from ZNC then reconnect). Maybe this is what's messing things up?
[17:50:50] <BtbN> znc does its own capability negotiation with the network
[17:50:58] <BtbN> anything you send from the client is only between that client and znc
[17:51:43] <Gnuman> and *raw only shows what goes on between ZNC and the network, right?
[17:51:59] <Gnuman> I see this: *raw  YOU -> [CAP END]
[17:52:28] <Gnuman> right at the beginning of *raw, after reconnecting my client to ZNC. Does that mean ZNC is sending "CAP END" to libera?
[17:52:34] <BtbN> Of course it will
[17:52:39] <BtbN> it'll do full normal cap negotiation
[17:53:30] <Gnuman> hmm... it doesn't send the "CAP END" to libera if I don't send "CAP END" to znc
[17:53:53] <Gnuman> I mean, it doesn't show it in *raw
[17:55:00] <Andrio> If you don't send CAP END during registration, you wouldn't get any *raw messages
[17:55:12] <Gnuman> I'm sure I need to send "CAP END", though. It's part of the IRC horse docs, and libera won't let the connection finish until I do.
[17:55:13] <Andrio> because you haven't registered with ZNC
[17:55:47] <Gnuman> hmm... ZNC doesn't require the CAP END, though
[17:55:51] <Andrio> It's independent of ZNC's capability negotiation with the IRC server, and unfortunately *raw doesn't show that
[17:55:52] <Gnuman> is that a bug?
[17:56:06] <Andrio> doesn't it?
[17:56:33] <Gnuman> If I modify my client to send "CAP REQ :server-time" before registration, but I leave the "CAP END", ZNC is cool with it.
[17:57:59] <Gnuman> (I'm connected like that right now and still chatting with you here
[17:58:42] <Andrio> I see.
[17:58:55] <Andrio> That would be a violation of the IRCv3 spec
[17:59:01] <Gnuman> I _think_ the ZNC->libera connection doesn't break if I leave "CAP END" out when connecting to ZNC, but connecting directly (client->libera) breaks if I leave the "CAP END" out.
[17:59:12] <Andrio> anyway, still doesn't have any bearing on what goes on between ZNC and Libera.
[17:59:24] <Gnuman> from what *raw is telling me, I think ZNC is sending an _extra_ "CAP END" whenever I connect my client to ZNC
[17:59:42] <Gnuman> because *raw only says "CAP END" when my client sends a "CAP END" to ZNC
[18:00:46] <Gnuman> and if ZNC isn't following the IRCv3 spec, that might explain why "CAP END" may be breaking ZNC's connection to libera
[18:02:34] <Andrio> Is it possible your client isn't parsing messages with tags correctly?
[18:02:37] <Gnuman> and to be fair, I'm not 100% sure that "CAP END" is causing the breakage. Everything worked perfectly before I started requesting server-time before registration (which requires a CAP END per spec), so maybe server-time is actually the one breaking it. It's hard to tell, because I have to disconnect my client from ZNC for several hours, then re-connect, to trigger the bug.
[18:03:07] <Gnuman> Andrio, the problem is that I can't send messages to libera. All incoming messages are recieved fine.
[18:03:16] <Andrio> hm
[18:03:28] <Gnuman> I'm also keeping an eye on my client's raw IRC messages during the whole debugging
[18:03:58] <Gnuman> I'm sending raw privmsg commands to a channel that I'm logged in on with another client (thelounge), and thelounge is not seeing them.
[18:04:28] <Gnuman> I also tried sending WHOIS and JOIN commands... absolutely nothing goes through
[18:04:53] <Andrio> Do you know whether ZNC commands work?
[18:04:59] <Gnuman> but next time I trigger this, I'm going to try sending commands over *raw and see what happens (thanks, btw!)
[18:05:05] <Gnuman> all ZNC commands work
[18:05:12] <Gnuman> I can talk to *status, etc
[18:05:28] <Gnuman> the only way I've found to fix this is to tell *status to disconnect then connect to libera
[18:05:45] <Gnuman> and I can PING to ZNC and get a PONG
[18:06:04] <Gnuman> and apparently ZNC is responding to libera pings, because it's remaining connected
[18:06:18] <Andrio> are you sure your ZNC was connected to Libera?
[18:06:29] <Andrio> could see it online from The Lounge?
[18:06:31] <Gnuman> yeah, because I still receive messages on my client
[18:06:54] <Gnuman> I can PRIVMSG my znc client from thelounge, and I see the message in my client
[18:07:05] <Gnuman> but I can't send anything back from my client to thelounge
[18:07:42] <Gnuman> and the worst part of this is I can't reproduce it without taking my client offline for several hours. I start messaging people and wondering why nobody responds.
[18:08:39] <Gnuman> I just disconnected and re-connected my client to ZNC several times in the last 30 minutes, trying to reproduce it... but it only happens if I remain disconnected for half a day or so.
[18:09:44] <DarthGandalf> Gnuman: znc -D may help you debugging this
[18:10:31] <Gnuman> thanks, I'll try that, too, if *raw doesn't work
[18:10:42] <DarthGandalf> znc -D shows more
[18:10:56] <Gnuman> I'm also installing ZNC on a new VPS in case it's the server's network connection that's the issue, but I'm thinking since it's TCP it should break both ways not just one.
[18:15:54] *** Quits: rvalue (~rvalue@user/rvalue) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[18:17:25] <Andrio> I know that operators on some IRCds can block all commands from someone other than stuff like PING/PONG/QUIT; not sure whether that happens here
[18:18:47] <Gnuman> interesting.... maybe the ircd is blocking me after a certain type of client misbehavior that it's seeing.

[18:20:17] <Khaytsus> So if you think a client is misbehaving, stop using it for a while see if it matters.  Server time CAP isn't exactly special, most clients do it.
[18:27:29] <Gnum4n> Khaytsus, using hexchat through ZNC, everything works fine.
[18:28:34] <Gnum4n> so it very well could be my client, but I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. when I get a broken znc->libera connection, hexchat won't even work through znc

[22:40:36] <Gnuman> sokan, you should be able to just copy the /var/lib/znc folder (or wherever your datadir is) to the new system
[22:41:08] <sokan> Gnuman: and password, setup, etc would all be there?
[22:41:45] <Gnuman> it's there on my system. just make sure you shutdown your znc server first, so the latest changes can be written there
[22:44:00] <sokan> will do! Thanks :)
[22:44:12] <sokan> fingers crossed it'll just work :)

[22:56:54] <Khaytsus> Just copy wherever the znc configs are, it'll vary for everyone...  but it'll just work as long as hte znc versions are similar.  
[22:57:11] <Khaytsus> And of course you need to have the same modules available on both if you're using modules, etc
