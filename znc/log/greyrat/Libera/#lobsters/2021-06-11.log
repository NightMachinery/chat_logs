[06:12:29] <manicennui> Yay! Anti-vaxxers on HN!
[06:14:48] <technomancy> the whole point of lobsters is to try to be able to forget HN exists
[06:15:38] <fro> oh is that why?
[06:15:46] <technomancy> pretty sure it is?
[06:15:55] <Xe> what is this "orange site"
[06:15:58] <bird> ehhhh kinda. but also hn is a little less focused than lobsters
[06:16:18] <bird> if you dont really care about business-y shit or you're more interested in focusing on technical stuff only...
[06:16:34] <bird> also hn comments has a bit of a lolbertarian bent to it
[06:16:44] <technomancy> bird: exactly
[06:17:13] <fro> i find simple things in comments on lobste.rs
[06:17:21] <fro> similar
[06:17:22] <fro> god
[06:17:24] <fro> can't type rn
[06:17:36] <bird> also i have an hn trolling pro-tip: say that you try to gauge facebook, uber, and palantir employees' ethical position by asking them a pointed question about how they feel working at those companies and building products with now known-bad-outcomes
[06:17:42] <bird> people fucking lose it
[06:17:46] <technomancy> fro: it is not a perfect solution

[06:18:08] <hoistbypetard> speaking of business-y shit... our resident hosiery's latest: https://lobste.rs/s/tcmn0u seems pretty OT to me :-/
[06:18:09] <mockturtle> [ Don’t Feed the Thought Leaders ] - lobste.rs
[06:18:17] <fro> they do get banned on lobste.rs at least
[06:18:20] <hoistbypetard> management satire, as pushcx put it in a recent mod log
[06:18:20] <fro> sometimes
[06:18:35] <bird> ive been repeatedly accused of being privileged, often by international workers who think of facebook/etc as a dream job and path to riches. And facebook employees who are suddenly very uncomfortable being called out. Multiple of them telling me that i just dont understand the mission :)

[06:19:03] <technomancy> bird: "it is difficult to get someone to understand something when their salary depends on them not understanding it"
[06:19:57] <geoffwozniak> hoistbypetard: I saw someone on twitter mocking that piece earlier. Didn't pay it much mind
[06:20:05] <bird> technomancy yes lol. but the majority of people simping dont work for these companies, so maybe it needs a small amendment to include people who want their salary to depend on them not understanding it (which is sad tbh
[06:20:16] <technomancy> yeeeeap
[06:20:36] <geoffwozniak> Granted, I've been rather busy to look into these things lately
[06:20:51] <hoistbypetard> geoffwozniak: I generally like poking fun at thought leaders. i was disappointed on that level as well.
[06:21:02] <bird> im an hn trolling superstar. i can get a dozen angry replies in a single post. you simply bring up ethics and ask "should we care about what we're being paid to build?" and HNers fucking go nuts
[06:21:16] <bird> is that even trolling? okay well the way i do it is but yeah
[06:21:37] <Xe> i troll hacker news by posting well-written thought-provoking articles with furry art in them
[06:21:51] <bird> this is actually based on a real candidate i gave a hard fail on because he worked on the uber god mode feature and saw no problem with it, and even used the "i was just following orders" excuse
[06:21:59] <imode> Xe: are you the one who wrote about bribery the other day.
[06:22:00] <bird> i told hn about that and that's what turned me on to this
[06:22:07] <Xe> imode: what
[06:22:13] <bkero> bird: it's like people haven't heard of the nuremberg trials before
[06:22:14] <geoffwozniak> I've spent this past week fixing something that someone spent a couple of years getting nowhere with
[06:22:18] <imode> Xe: nevermind.
[06:22:21] <Xe> i'm the christine.website person
[06:22:26] <imode> oh.
[06:22:30] <imode> wrong site with furry art.
[06:22:32] <fro> i don't purposely troll anywhere
[06:22:50] <bird> bkero dude seemed actually mad in the interview that i was asking him this. mind you the feature he worked on MADE THE INTERNATIONAL NEWS. like... do you not have an opinion on that? at all? jesus
[06:23:01] <bird> i dont want to work with this person
[06:23:04] <bird> and then i didnt have to!
[06:23:17] <bkero> Good. The system was working as intended.
[06:23:30] <bkero> Although I'm sure he can get his next job by just not mentioning that he worked on that particular feature.
[06:23:32] <imode> I got banned from HN for calling Lee a piece of shit on a public forum.
[06:23:36] <bird> eh he probably got $150k+ at some other shop
[06:23:45] <c355e3b> my only complaint with the furry art is the aria tag issues
[06:24:15] <bird> i got accused of being homophobic on hn for saying peter thiel was a queer traitor. okay maybe that wasnt the forum for it but like... yeah
[06:24:25] <imode> bahahahahahaha.
[06:24:26] <c355e3b> As a replacement for office background noise, I'm having my desktop read the articles out via tts
[06:24:37] <geoffwozniak> And this past week has solidified my thought that testing anyting with expect(1) is just a bad idea
[06:24:55] <hoistbypetard> expect(1) is a lifesaver
[06:24:58] <fro> i think i called someone a jackass on lobste.rs once
[06:25:01] <fro> did not get banned
[06:25:05] <fro> felt right
[06:25:11] <c355e3b> geoffwozniak: expect is the dark glue that holds the world together
[06:25:13] <hoistbypetard> i'd never want to rely on it as an important piece of test infrastructure
[06:25:21] <geoffwozniak> hoistbypetard: I see so many intermittent failures
[06:25:32] <c355e3b> what about production at a fortune 500?
[06:25:34] <bird> also i only post on hn through our work vpn, im trying to get our /24 nuked
[06:25:53] <geoffwozniak> Doesn't help that our simulator is... of questionable quality
[06:25:54] <c355e3b> bird where are you at to have a /24?
[06:26:45] <hoistbypetard> c355e3b: oddly, i'm more ok with that. for production stuff that you have no other way to automate, it's worth the time to build the guardrails to make it work. -ish.
[06:26:58] <bird> not gonna say but it was also a joke, our vpn only has one ip address egress
[06:26:59] <hoistbypetard> for test stuff, no one ever does that so you get unreliable tests
[06:27:27] <hoistbypetard> (and if you're testing stuff you built/control, there are so many better ways...)
[06:29:11] <geoffwozniak> hoistbypetard: oh man, tell me about it
[06:31:35] <geoffwozniak> I just got into this project this week and I'm stunned at the architecture decisions
[06:34:05] <geoffwozniak> I have to sleep now
[06:34:39] <hoistbypetard> Good luck.
[06:36:06] <JordiGH> Hmmmmm...
[06:36:13] <JordiGH> I think I managed to register a Signal number.
[06:36:21] <JordiGH> But now I can't make signal-cli send contacts to signal-desktop
[06:36:47] <JordiGH> The signal-cli daemon says it got a request to synch groups...
[06:36:56] <JordiGH> But then the desktop client seems to be waiting forever for a response?

[17:21:43] <cepi> aaah, all right! :)
[17:21:44] <geoffwozniak> iDrougge: it means you can't change the data, but it may change anyway
[17:22:06] <iDrougge> Does it make sense?
[17:22:17] <geoffwozniak> Only on weird embedded parts
[17:22:36] <iDrougge> I know volatile, but const seems to have so many meanings in C/C++.
[17:23:05] <geoffwozniak> It's allowed by the standard.  It's just very strange.
[17:23:18] <cepi> For the most part isn't const just "don't write to this thing"?
[17:23:26] <cepi> in C++ I mean
[17:23:41] <geoffwozniak> It's all this bizarre shit that C apologists ignore when they say C is the best language
[17:24:05] <iDrougge> Simple language, few reserved keywords.
[17:24:21] <geoffwozniak> Whether the customer actually needs const volatile is something else entirely
[17:24:24] <thardin_> C is love. C is life
[17:24:25] <bsandro> i makes sense imo once you wrap your head around base principles
[17:24:43] <geoffwozniak> Often our customers just chuck volatile on every declaration until they get the outcome they want
[17:24:57] <thardin_> const volatile sounds like something that you put on memory mapped hardware addresses
[17:25:04] <thardin_> read-only ones that is
[17:25:10] <geoffwozniak> thardin_: it's about the only use case
[17:25:26] <c355e3b> its also really nice when writing eBPFs
[17:25:34] <c355e3b> because, those things refuse to play by the rules
[17:25:43] <thardin_> geoffwozniak: I can see it being useful in MT code as well
[17:25:52] <geoffwozniak> MT code?
[17:25:55] <thardin_> multithreaded
[17:26:05] <thardin_> if you only have a single thread writing to something then cast away const only in that thread
[17:26:19] <c355e3b> and skip needing a lock?
[17:26:27] <thardin_> no, you still need a lock
[17:26:33] <thardin_> or, a barrier
[17:26:58] <geoffwozniak> What happens with const volatile declarations is that it is mapped to read-only memory by default, but often it has to be placed at a specific address

[19:05:40] <cepi> what's your favorite thing about fastapi? it certainly looks interesting
[19:07:36] <hoistbypetard> the very low boilerplate is what drew me in. pydantic's use of type annotations to validate incoming requests before handing them off to the app is what gets me to stay.

[19:08:56] <ngoldbaum> so ugly
[19:09:12] <cepi> It does look like it's a very fast way to get an api up and running, might have to try it at some point :)
[19:09:18] <hoistbypetard> me too. it took using pydantic in this way to get me to care enough to use them
[19:10:07] <cepi> really doesn't look that bad to me
[19:12:12] <hoistbypetard> they give me a sad because they mostly serve as hints for linters. or jetbrains things. i'd like the runtime to do a little more with them by default. guarded by a -w flag when you invoke the interpreter, if need be.
[19:12:30] <cepi> Aaah yes, in that sense I absolutely agree
[19:13:32] <ngoldbaum> i think starting a new library with types is fine, bolting them onto an existing library and forcing everyone to deal with them less so, they make API documentation very very wordy for little gain
[19:14:08] <ngoldbaum> especially so for libraries where the types were added after the fact, usually the original API wasn’t written in a way where you’d get nice types that are easy to read

[20:11:11] <iDrougge> Xe: It is also dependent on the echo system. In JS, you need a dependency to compare two dates. Which pulls in two more. Which pull in two more each.
[20:11:31] <iDrougge> Languages with less anemic standard libraries have "shallower" dependencies.
[20:11:43] <cepi> Xe: (Answering how I act at work in regards to the question) Yes, because 1. when I do I have to either document clearly how it is used or explain it directly to my colleagues, because 2. it introduces another point of failure in regards to security and because 3. fewer dependencies makes it easier for new colleagues (less to learn)

[20:27:16] <iDrougge> companion_cube: Dart has kept fallthrough.
[20:27:23] <bradfier> Xe: I think it also depends on the size and 'weirdness' of the dependency, if we use Rust as the example because that's what I'm familiar with, I'm going to be a lot more circumspect about pulling in tokio or async-std than I am about popping `base64` into my Cargo.toml
[20:27:24] <companion_cube> iDrougge: yeah that's absolutely terrible
[20:27:34] <companion_cube> Dart looks terrible overall, I wish they'd just let it die
[20:27:43] <bradfier> Like, I can write a base64 codec myself but that's not what I'm getting paid for
[20:27:46] <companion_cube> but no, they could not accept kotlin, they had to stir their own shit
[20:27:47] <iDrougge> C# isn't old. ALGOL is old, and didn't have fallthrough.
[20:27:56] <iDrougge> Pascal is old, and didn't have fallthrough.
[20:28:05] <iDrougge> And C# was designed by Pascal experts.
[20:28:07] <iDrougge> "designed"
[20:28:10] <companion_cube> heh
[20:28:47] <companion_cube> my guess is that they wanted to look like C++
[20:28:55] <iDrougge> Yes, Dart is, to quote Brian Kernighan, "not my favourite language".
[20:29:04] <technomancy> someone told me yesterday that C# has implicit copying of structs when they're passed as arguments and it made me sad
[20:29:17] <iDrougge> Walking backwards into the future.
[20:29:20] <technomancy> like ... I had heard that C# was better than Java, but now I don't know what to believe
[20:29:23] <cepi> technomancy: it does, you have to use "ref" to get a reference to it
[20:29:25] <rwb> https://github.com/Droogans/unmaintainable-code/blob/master/README.md
[20:29:26] <mockturtle> [ Droogans/unmaintainable-code ] - github.com
[20:29:40] <iDrougge> technomancy: Java doesn't have structs.
[20:29:42] <companion_cube> technomancy: like, by-value structs?
[20:29:46] <companion_cube> that'd make sense
[20:29:54] <kirch> I heard C# was a fork of Java.... and I'm pretty sure Typescript is Javascript for C# Devs
[20:29:55] <technomancy> companion_cube: that's what they call it, but it's actually just implicit copying
[20:29:58] <technomancy> it's incredibly stupid
[20:30:06] <companion_cube> iDrougge: also when they made Dart 2, so, recently, wow, they didn't even add nullability checks
[20:30:09] <companion_cube> technomancy: it's not
[20:30:11] <companion_cube> structs are just values
[20:30:20] <cepi> ^
[20:30:22] <companion_cube> Vec3, complex, etc. shouldn't have identity
[20:30:24] <technomancy> oh, are they immutable in C#?
[20:30:26] <iDrougge> companion_cube: Remember that Dart wasn't invented in a vacuum.
[20:30:33] <cepi> technomancy: by default, yes
[20:30:35] <companion_cube> iDrougge: I'd call google a vacuum…
[20:30:39] <iDrougge> It was invented at the world's richest technology company which only recruits geniuses.
[20:30:42] <companion_cube> but that's insulting to the ones that actually suck
[20:30:46] <rwb> C# refs are VB ByRef
[20:30:47] <technomancy> cepi: so ... why copy it if it's immutable?
[20:30:50] <technomancy> that's even stupider!
[20:30:53] <companion_cube> why not copy?
[20:30:59] <companion_cube> makes lifetimes much simpler
[20:31:04] <companion_cube> rust does the same, like C, C++, etc.
[20:31:07] <cepi> it depends on the size of the object as well, does it not?

[20:37:02] <companion_cube> it can, it's just not forced to
[20:37:08] <companion_cube> it should do it for small structs

[20:37:20] <companion_cube> technomancy: I think it's great to pass by copy, what is the issue
[20:37:21] <cb> modern C can opass structs by value

[20:37:58] <technomancy> companion_cube: if you can't pass a struct to a function then structs aren't first class

[20:40:39] <companion_cube> if you do `struct foo a = …;  struct foo b = a;` that's a copy

[20:40:56] <cb> *classes* in C# are byref
[20:41:02] <technomancy> that doesn't make any sense. it's a variable that describes a memory location.
[20:41:18] <companion_cube> not necessarily, the compiler might put it into registers
[20:41:18] <cepi> technomancy: I don't think everyone agrees on that definition

[20:44:01] <companion_cube> it's C after all
[20:44:07] <companion_cube> `int a = 17; a=2;` is just the same
[20:44:10] <technomancy> companion_cube: that's a common misconception
[20:44:20] <technomancy> changing the variable rather than the contents of the variable
[20:44:33] <companion_cube> well look, `struct foo a = …; a = b; …` is the same
[20:44:35] <companion_cube> you change a
[20:44:46] <technomancy> I'm talking about changing the fields inside it
[20:44:50] <companion_cube> so what?
[20:44:59] <edk> that's no different from changing bits in an int variable
[20:45:00] <companion_cube> it's like `int a = 17; a = (a | 1)`
[20:45:01] <rwb> const int a = 1; int b[1]; b[-1] = 2; printf("%d\n", a);
[20:45:16] <companion_cube> there's even `|=` and `&=` if you like!

[20:45:31] <rwb> i flipped the stack in my head

[22:20:13] <Lulu> I wish they would put some effort into making something like Telegram's client.
[22:20:20] <bkero> Signal has many problems, but the protocol being 'open source' isn't one of them
[22:20:36] <bkero> JordiGH: My understanding is that it proxied all traffic through another device. Maybe that is no longer tue.
[22:20:46] <JordiGH> signal-cli can be that device.
