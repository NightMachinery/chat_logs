[20:41:40] <lelit> hi
[20:43:35] <bremner> lelit: hi, what's up?
[20:44:12] <lelit> bremner: I have a tiny annoyance with the ML, that maybe you can quickly hint: I read it thru the related gmane.io newsgroup, but since some time I also receive a copy of each message to my email address
[20:44:26] <lelit> as said, not(much) of a problem
[20:44:44] <lelit> but I'm pretty sure I didn't change anything in my setup
[20:45:01] <bremner> lelit: hmm. It might have happened because your address was disabled because of bounces, and I re-enabled all of those
[20:45:19] <lelit> oh
[20:45:44] <bremner> so possibly my fault, but maybe you can try just turning off delivery again?
[20:46:23] <bremner> it currently shows no users with disabled delivery
[20:47:29] <lelit> is there some interface on the ML to say "do not send message"? maybe I'm heading to the wrong site, but from notmuchmail.org I reach the ML nmbug.notmuchmail.org/list, and there I only see "subscribe" or "unsubscribe"
[20:47:59] <bremner> no, you have to do it by mail.
[20:48:04] <bremner> let me check something.
[20:48:57] <lelit> ok
[20:57:21] <bremner> hrm. the more I know mailman3, the less I love it.
[20:59:33] <lelit> oh
[21:04:46] <bremner> I couldn't find how you can do it yourself, but if you unsubscribe, next time you want to send an email to the list I can enable your address to send to the list without a subscription
[21:07:05] <lelit> ok, hopefully that won't "damage" the ability to post thru gmane
[21:07:57] <bremner> uh, well, I guess we'll have to see.
[21:08:03] <lelit> but, are you saying that mailman3 does not provide an "account settings"?
[21:08:19] <bremner> well, they seem to expect people to run their web interface.
[21:08:26] <lelit> yeah, not a great problem, thanks
[21:10:14] <lelit> ok, done
