[03:47:33] <thrice> grub or systmed-boot are probably the two most popular for efi

[03:47:42] <rabbitnightmare> spongebab: this system is finnicky you wouldnt be able to help
[03:48:00] <rabbitnightmare> CandyAngel: so pacman -S syslinux?
[03:48:14] <spongebab> is systemd boot separate to an efistub?
[03:48:34] <CandyAngel> If you want to install syslinux, yeah.
[03:49:00] <thrice> I can't think of any good reason to prefer syslinux
[03:49:03] <spongebab> i thought there was a way to just boot through linux itself, without an explicit bootloader (in uefi land at least)
[03:49:10] <CandyAngel> When I set syslinux up on an UEFI machine (like.. a week ago), the EFI partition was mounted at /boot/EFI

[03:59:39] <CandyAngel> Auto-generating the config is fine.. but the documentation I read was that "any time you change the configuration, you have to run X to compile it or GRUB won't see your changes"
[03:59:53] * CandyAngel rubs face
[04:00:33] <thurstylark> it just uses the info from the individual files to generate a config

[07:00:43] <kevr> it doesn't?
[07:00:55] * kevr shrugs
[07:00:55] <dieggsy> i'd like xdg-open to open a new tab, not every possible invocation of the firefox application
[07:00:56] <ectospasm> Yeah, Firefox should have a way to open URLs from the CLI in a new tab.

[07:01:32] <dieggsy> i have a workaround since really what i'm after is for emacs to open new links in a new tab, and i can just tell it not to use xdg-open and use firefox directly instead
[07:01:39] <kevr> and same with xdg-open
[07:01:57] <dieggsy> kevr: maybe you configured your desktop file lol
[07:02:02] <kevr> no, i did not.

[12:30:22] <jancoow> ;p
[12:30:56] <Edu4rdSHL> jancoow, having a mirror from Cloudflare is something VERY good, specially with pacman's parallel downloads.

[12:38:20] <Edu4rdSHL> Still good, I think. I don't have the most powerful internet but I can't take advantages of my full bandwidth (500Mbps), I hope that I will take more advantage of it, even if not full.

[23:51:08] <n00b101> There's no Android channel in Libera. They haven't shifted from freenode. Didn't it?

[23:55:39] <vindicator> Does anything else special have to go with "rd.break"? I set the selected boot entry, appending "rd.break=pre-udev", yet it still boots all the way through systemd to the command prompt. This is me just playing with archiso.
[23:58:05] <Namarrgon> the archiso's initramfs doesn't use systemd, does it?
