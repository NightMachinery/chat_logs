[01:32:28] <Gustavo6046> How come, when I switch to a text tty, the sound server (pipewire) restarts?
[01:33:03] <Gustavo6046> And then everything that was playing on it, suddenly isn't anymore. This isn't the first time. I was running OpenTTD, checked htop on tty2 momentarily, then I returned and it was still quiet. Not only that, but when I tried to close it, it stalled and I had to sigkill it from said htop.
[01:33:08] <hexnewbie> Gustavo6046: Does it crash, or is it being ‘smart’?
[01:33:21] <Gustavo6046> hexnewbie, I'm not sure. I'll verify journalctl --user -u pipewire
[01:33:26] <hexnewbie> Gustavo6046: If started a user service, what does the journal say of that service
[01:33:29] <hexnewbie> yeah
[01:33:59] <Gustavo6046> We think alike :D
[01:34:13] <Gustavo6046> Hmm, pipewire doesn't have any noticeable message
[01:34:34] <hexnewbie> Not even that it stops (was restarted)? Did the process die during that time, or is it still the old process?

[01:35:34] <hexnewbie> PulseAudio's behaviour when it comes to TTY logins (NOT switching) has changed after systemd made the /run/user/1000 dir happen, but they've been favourable changes.
[01:35:35] <Gustavo6046> But both pipewire and pipewire-pulse have similar PIDs, 1204 and 1207, which suggests that they were not terminated.

[01:51:52] <gothicserpent> a friend of mine had issues with PW and had to revert
[01:51:57] <Gustavo6046> hexnewbie, well, it does make pipewire-pulse hiccup somehow, which is evident becaeuse a little popup appears on the top right corner of the screen (pa-applet?).
[01:52:10] <Gustavo6046> You know, the one that appears when you change the sound volume or mute it entirely.
[01:52:50] <hexnewbie> Yeah, I've been itching to suggest to Gustavo6046 to switch to PulseAudio, but I've grown up preferring to troubleshoot and fix an issue. This one is odd.

[01:53:13] <Gustavo6046> khronosschoty, gothicserpent, it generally does for me. I used to have enormous issues with PulseAudio, and with JACK. I can't go pure JACK because many games only support PulseAudio, and I don't really like PulseAudio because, unlike PipeWire, it's slow. Also, no distro supplies with *only* ALSA and no software sound server, which surely means something.
[01:53:17] <khronosschoty> its true if your going to use something like PW or PA then its saner at this stage to use PA

[01:57:27] <Gustavo6046> It's probably related to the fact that, for some reason, the main thread of games is always set to -11 nice level (realtime?)

[02:16:50] <Inline> well that's long time ago
[02:16:52] <Inline> lol
[02:17:01] <Inline> i use 10 fingers too
[02:17:10] <Inline> but i have too many false hits on the keyboard
[02:17:13] <Gustavo6046> why am I nervous
[02:17:18] <khronosschoty> all ten to type, in a typical situation?
[02:17:21] <Sauvin> In my case, it comes from having used to be able to play a piano.
[02:17:26] <Inline> take your pills Gustavo6046
[02:17:28] <Inline> lol
[02:17:31] <Gustavo6046> lol
[02:17:34] <Gustavo6046> I mean from the race
[02:17:39] <akdev> according to that I did 114 wpm - odd
[02:17:47] <khronosschoty> I don't think I ever go that far in a typing class where all ten where used
[02:17:49] <hexnewbie> Gustavo6046: Two rounds? After the fifth round it starts giving you the difficult ones, and that's after you've forgotten what a boat is
[02:17:50] <Gustavo6046> I did 114 wpm

[02:23:32] <derek-shnosh> delete sends to "trash" shift-delete nukes file immediately
[02:23:35] <[itchyjunk]> I notice delete puts thing into recycle bin but not shift delete but i don't really know the diff
[02:23:38] <sheep> it depends on the application
[02:23:39] <[itchyjunk]> ah
[02:23:48] <[itchyjunk]> is "trash" just a folder or something?
[02:23:48] <rbox> [itchyjunk]: well it sounds like you figured out the difference...
[02:24:02] <[itchyjunk]> i thought "trash" was also deleted stuff
[02:24:13] <derek-shnosh> basically, yes... trash is just a folder that contains deleted items until emptied.
[02:24:21] <derek-shnosh> shift-delete bypasses trash and just nukes the file.
[02:24:40] <[itchyjunk]> So before you empty the trash, you've not really freed any memory?
[02:24:43] <akdev> [itchyjunk], if you can look at things in the thrash then they aren't really deleted, are they?
[02:25:08] <[itchyjunk]> hmm right
[02:25:10] *** Joins: donught (~donught@cpe-76-93-146-134.san.res.rr.com)
[02:25:33] <[itchyjunk]> if from terminal, i `rm -rf folderName`, this is like shift delete then, since it doesn't add to trash.
[02:25:41] <derek-shnosh> yes
[02:25:42] <akdev> correct
[02:25:42] <[itchyjunk]> would trashing be like `mv folderName` ?

[03:38:24] <[itchyjunk]> Bocaneri, i don't want to delete any of the files. there are .java files and at the top of each files there is a /** blah **/ and i would like to remove all of those.
[03:38:47] <[itchyjunk]> It has sensitive information and if i could remove it, i would be able to push it to github without worrying about that.
[03:38:50] <ayecee> [itchyjunk]: how would you do it for one file?
[03:39:53] <[itchyjunk]> Manually, open a .java file, look for the first /** to **/ then remove this.
[03:40:01] <[itchyjunk]> How would I automate this? I am not sure.
[03:40:03] <derek-shnosh> So you want to replace /** blah **/ inside all files inside a directory, recursively?
[03:40:07] <ayecee> fair enough
[03:40:20] <ayecee> is it always the first line?
[03:40:20] <[itchyjunk]> `find Java -name *.java` seems to get me all the files i want. just need a way to open and remove now
[03:40:23] <derek-shnosh> [itchyjunk]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1583219/how-can-i-do-a-recursive-find-replace-of-a-string-with-awk-or-sed
[03:40:26] <[itchyjunk]> derek-shnosh, yes
[03:40:37] <[itchyjunk]> yes its always at the top of each file
[03:40:46] <Bocaneri> Is it always the same blah blah?
[03:40:47] <ayecee> is it a fixed string?
[03:41:09] <[itchyjunk]> it's not always the same blah, it contains my name and the date i made it in so different dates for each file
[03:41:26] <ayecee> does it always contain your name, and do any other files contain your name on the first line?
[03:41:31] <[itchyjunk]> but it's always between /** **/ at the top
[03:41:48] <[itchyjunk]> always contains my name and no other files do
[03:42:07] <derek-shnosh> sed + regex should work.
[03:42:14] <ayecee> so you can try this with a single file and see if it works, sed -i '1/yourname/d' filename
[03:42:42] <ayecee> if that works, you can automate that command with find, but let's see if that works first.

[04:29:29] <tirnanog> they are unsigned 64-bit integers, unless you're using a broken userspace.
[04:29:42] <ayecee> or a 32-bit system, right

[05:32:28] <legend> Today it ends
[05:32:29] <legend> RIP CentOS
[05:32:48] <legend> and Happy New Year!
[05:32:51] <ayecee> it's not dead, it's pining for the fjords
[05:33:02] <legend> well we have Rockylinux now
[05:33:09] <Dagmar> ...and Alma
[05:33:13] <legend> built by the original CentOS people
[05:33:20] <legend> oh and Alma of course
[05:33:41] <legend> A guy oh phoronix said he migrated 400 servers (VMs) to Alma using a script
[05:33:44] <legend> *on
[05:33:57] <legend> so I assume it aint that hard no?
[05:33:58] <Dagmar> You pretty much can
[05:34:03] <rbox> does the fact that its 400 make it impressive?
[05:34:08] <rbox> if it was 10 would it be less impressive?
[05:34:25] <legend> yes
[05:34:40] <rbox> is 100 impressive?
[05:34:43] <legend> 400 servers running stably after the same script runs is quite impressive
[05:34:45] <legend> 10 servers could be done manually
[05:34:53] <legend> rbox: yes 100, would be impresive
[05:34:58] <rbox> what about 50?
[05:34:58] <legend> Dagmar: you using Alma?
[05:35:07] <Dagmar> I've got some of each now
[05:35:09] <legend> depends on your workloads
[05:35:30] <Dagmar> Ther'es no significant difference between them that I can see

[11:30:51] <Bocaneri> You have an multi-TB EXFAT!?
[11:30:57] <khronosschoty> yikes
[11:31:06] <WickedDekciw> Bocaneri, It shipped with that, as many drives do.
[11:31:13] <Bocaneri> what's on it?
[11:31:40] <WickedDekciw> Well, it's an external drive so it mostly has important files and stuff, were I able to back it up I just would but it's not as easy
[11:31:44] <TudbuTD> ah

[14:59:37] <qqz> if I do sftp < <( cat; )
[15:00:19] <tirnanog> sftp would be reading from a pipe in that case. that's a non-interactive use case so it's very likely deliberate.

[16:11:43] <hexnewbie> labrador: Well, the only help that could be provided here is if OFTC diagnose an issue with their SASL reaching services, *or* you set the delay to 140 seconds instead
[16:12:22] <labrador> I'll try both
[16:12:43] <hexnewbie> And the obvious troubleshooting to see if SASL password causes the same delay, etc. but... Unless current or former OFTC staff are here, what will you do with the result of the troubleshooting is unclear 😉

[16:33:36] <tirnanog> tomty89: here's what I've found out. systemd provides /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/org.freedesktop.login1.policy. there, it can be seen that the implicit authorizations for shutting down are "allow_active" and "allow_inactive" but not "allow_any".

[16:34:43] <tirnanog> tomty89: polkit(8) sheds some light on it by describing allow_active as appliying to "active sessions on local consoles", and "inactive sessions" in the case of allow_inactive. however, it does not explain the distinction between an active and inactive session.
[16:34:55] *** Joins: multi8 (~dark@c83-250-57-237.bredband.tele2.se)
[16:35:04] <tirnanog> so yes, it's definitely a remote-or-not check, as it were.

[16:38:44] <tirnanog> tomty89: my best guess at present is that it means the linux virtual console (which would make sense actually).

[18:24:12] <Whatshisface> linuxlover: in what way?
[18:24:18] <euouae> nomagno so you have no way to prove whether the package update is from the maintainer or hacked account
[18:24:20] <labrador> nomagno, try rewriting all of that then. And in what language? Bash was what it was previously written in. The  only candidate would be javascript :)

[20:16:01] <tirnanog> anddam: that's possible and probably worth looking into. but even if not, you can implement your own if your code is all that's responsible for spawning it. it's very easy with util-linux.
[20:16:07] * rascul races around the conditions
[20:16:15] <anddam> tirnanog: btw I am not on systemd but on runit (I run Void), also I am using dwm so not X session manager (redshift has little sense outside an X11 session)
[20:16:25] <anddam> tirnanog: thanks again
[20:16:43] <tirnanog> anddam: as for the applicability of a TOCTOU, it's basically this: by the time you've matched a process by name by way of walking the process table, there's no proof that this process exists (or not) by the time you get to spawning it.
[20:17:07] <rascul> can use a session manager with dwm

[22:02:25] <wisbit> Dagmar, I'm asking here because Google has no answer, been at it for 2 days already
[22:02:30] <Dagmar> Yeah.  People who solve sticky problems usually post _somewherE_ about them, and being a laptop it at least has specific chipsets that someone else probably already dug out the info for
[22:02:37] <whatshisface> yah, that sounds better and makes more sense.

[23:45:47] *** kish` is now known as habanero
[23:45:58] <ayecee> as a guess
[23:46:02] <Gustavo6046> So should I give systemd parenting advice? :p

[23:46:10] <ayecee> enough of this gay banter

[23:46:47] *** Joins: scoobydoo (~scooby@user/scoobydoo)
[23:46:54] <Gustavo6046> Ohh right, init IS systemd, I'm stupid
[23:46:57] <hexnewbie> systemd is the best parent a process could ask for
[23:46:59] <mrfb> you tried both?
[23:47:01] <s33ker> ayecee sorry just this one... the command i was mentioning seems to open shell within a shell is that correct ? I have to exit 2 times to get out of the server if i use the command once.
[23:47:10] <hexnewbie> never afraid to use the stick
[23:47:11] <jim> so it's possible the sigterm is coming from something other than its parent?
[23:47:29] <ayecee> Gustavo6046: would be worth considering, why networkmanager starts when you login.
[23:47:46] <ayecee> instead of at boot
[23:47:56] <ayecee> s33ker: yes
[23:48:01] <wisbit> mrfb, dmesg [    3.649978] snd_hda_intel 0000:00:0e.0: bound 0000:00:02.0 (ops i915_audio_component_bind_ops [i915]
[23:48:02] <Gustavo6046> It starts because it's enabled as a service (systemctl enable NetworkManager), and I think it starts at login because of how it's specified in the unit?
[23:48:02] <mrfb> wisbit: I think we have here a snow ball effect, too many things tried with probably some miss-steps in between, we don't know exactly why is failing really

[23:49:17] <Gustavo6046> ayecee, oh right, well maybe it does start on boot then
[23:49:23] <ayecee> maybe
[23:49:33] <Gustavo6046> it'd probably be an user service if it did start on login

[23:51:50] <Gustavo6046> So something definitely is wrong, even if NetworkManager still is running.
[23:51:55] <mrfb> wisbit: last resort is removing the firmware from pacmac, and downloading the binary package from the repo I linked and doing a manual install of the firmware. Other option would be test another distribution like Ubuntu which packs the firmware (Just a live image, no need to re install) to see if that works
