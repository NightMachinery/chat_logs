[18:32:42] <ychaouche> hey seders, I'd like to translate a linux path (/) to a windows path (\) so basically just s%/%\%g, but doing it that way doesn't give desired results. My sed script is in a file that has this content : 
[18:32:52] <ychaouche> echo "$@" | sed s%/%\%g 
[18:33:07] <ychaouche> I call it this way : ~/SCRIPTS/linuxtowindowspaths '\\192.168.100.150/donnees/Software and Tools/Remote/Teamviewer/host/'
[18:33:29] <ychaouche> result is : \\192.168.100.150donneesSoftware and ToolsRemoteTeamviewerhost
[18:33:32] <Soliton> # echo s%/%\%g
[18:33:33] <phy1729> you need to escape the \   s%/%\\%g
[18:33:34] <ychaouche> (no \ is added)
[18:33:36] <shbot> Soliton: s%/%%g
[18:34:11] <ychaouche> phy1729: sed: -e expression #1, char 7: unterminated `s' command
[18:34:11] <Soliton> what phy1729 said plus single quotes.
[18:34:41] <ychaouche> ah, works better with single quotes :)
[18:34:46] <ychaouche> thanks to you both guys.
[18:35:58] <Soliton> btw, echo will not work well depending on shell and arguments.
[18:35:59] <ychaouche> btw, sed is not an interpreter, right ? it can't have its own shebang
[18:36:14] <Soliton> you can put sed in the shebang, yes.
[18:36:24] <ychaouche> oh ? and then I can get rid of echo ?
[18:36:52] <phy1729> you can get rid of the echo anyway and use stdin to the script
[18:36:58] <Soliton> yes but you need to provide input then not arguments.
[18:37:23] <ychaouche> and the content of the file wouldn't have sed in it, right ? 
[18:37:30] <ychaouche> I mean the content of the script
[18:37:51] <ychaouche> since it's already interpreted by sed, I'd just write s%/%'\\'%g  directly ?
[18:38:32] <Soliton> without the quotes.
[18:39:29] <Soliton> shebang would be something like: #!/bin/sed -f
[18:40:34] <ychaouche> works great with -f
[18:40:44] <ychaouche> and invoking it with a here document
[18:40:56] <ychaouche> or is that here string ? 
[18:41:08] <Soliton> both are fine.
[18:41:11] <ychaouche> ~/SCRIPTS/linuxtowindowspaths <<<"\\192.168.100.150/donnees/Software and Tools/Remote/Teamviewer/host/"
[18:41:21] <Soliton> that's a here string.
[18:41:28] <ychaouche> thanks :)
[18:41:42] <Soliton> # echo "\\"
[18:41:44] <shbot> Soliton: \
[18:42:24] <Soliton> if you want two backslashes there use single quotes or write four.
