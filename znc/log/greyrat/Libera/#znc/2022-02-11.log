[01:19:35] <DarthGandalf> nosy
[01:19:53] <DarthGandalf> and it's not ad revenue on the IRC
[01:20:43] <DarthGandalf> but ad revenues from showing you ads because your HTTP traffic comes from the same IP which was receiving some plain text data which contained some keywords
[01:21:34] <tux0r> and how would google etc. get your ip while you talk here?
[01:21:52] <DarthGandalf> not necessary google even
[01:22:08] <tux0r> just like the usenet and gopher, the irc is not interesting for Big Corp anymore - including everyone who sells advertising
[01:22:25] <tux0r> name one irc server which also runs a web-based network
[01:22:38] <DarthGandalf> and why do you think the middle man which is between your computer and irc server won't sell the keywords to some other parties
[01:22:53] <DarthGandalf> it's not specific to IRC, but any plain text connection
[01:22:56] <tux0r> because the irc is not worth the effort anymore
[01:23:02] <DarthGandalf> IRC is irrelevant
[01:23:16] <tux0r> ah right, my ISP will sell my communication
[01:23:28] <tux0r> sounds plausible

[19:06:42] <babyface> what's the point with that functionality
[19:07:37] <bookworm> sasl auth is a protocol that authenticates you to a IRC server very early in the connection... normally you could have a race where you were already trying to join restricted chans before the auth succeeded
[19:08:07] <bookworm> which also means your hostmask isn't applied and people see the original IP etc
[19:08:28] <bookworm> lots of drawback which are simply not there if you auth early

[19:25:20] <Khaytsus> Always use SASL when the network supports it, and always set "don't connect if sasl fails"
[19:25:34] *** Joins: ikeaviking (~ikeavikin@caffeine.packetghost.com)
[19:25:40] <Khaytsus> Honestly not even sure why that's an option except for testing or something.
[19:28:57] <MetaNova> Khaytsus: services might be split
[19:29:23] <MetaNova> either outright, or you could be connecting to the wrong end of a netsplit
[19:29:23] <Khaytsus> I think I'd still rather bounce in that case, personally
[19:29:52] <MetaNova> oh, you mean why allowing the connection if SASL fails?
[19:29:58] <Khaytsus> Yes
[19:30:14] <Khaytsus> If SASL fails on a network I know has SASL I want it to fail ;)
[19:30:22] <MetaNova> hm
[19:30:38] <Khaytsus> But it's an option, users can make their own choice there
