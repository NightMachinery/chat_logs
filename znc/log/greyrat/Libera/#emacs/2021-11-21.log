[05:33:37] <bpalmer> I think it's by adding things to the hooks, but use-package is doing a lot of things. You have a lot of print statements, so you can probably trace it, but verify (a) typescript-mode-hook calls lsp somehow
[05:33:47] <bpalmer> and that the way it calls it is the same way as when you call it manually

[08:52:12] <benoitj> It should work without it
[08:53:05] <holycow> from what i can tell it's because the lisp code can only be run by talking to the compiled code over swank / slime
[08:53:49] <holycow> when i try to set the global-set-key in the emacs session the function is not recognized via tab completion
[08:54:01] *** Joins: uniQue (~user@80.227.170.170)
[08:54:13] <holycow> which i think makes sense as it is not an emacs function it is a common lisp function running in sbcl and connected via slime / swank

[08:56:17] <holycow> yeah, i'm a noob, just learning the basics.  i'm getting my self into trouble here because emacs makes it so easy to customize stuff, it would be nice to be able to create functions and call them over the swank connection.

[08:57:29] <benoitj> Ok
[08:57:34] <incal> o/ remember my music question? here is on in Lisp - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_(programming_language) - but in M/ELPA no mention of Nyquist and also no mode for XLISP. and even if one had a mode it wouldn't be the same, one needs a whole SLIME then, so one can change and eval on-the fly, well a SLIME not for CL but XLISP that is
[08:57:37] <holycow> i have to manually enter them by going through the debugger interface.
[08:58:14] <benoitj> There must be an lisp eval at point

[17:56:34] <Guest3> I find guile is more like python or perl.
[17:56:56] <grym> "Guile implements a number of interpreters and compilers on different language levels. For example, there is an interpreter for the Scheme language that is itself implemented as a Scheme program compiled to a bytecode for a low-level virtual machine shipped with Guile. That virtual machine is implemented by both an interpreter—a C program that interprets the bytecodes—and a compiler—a C program that 
[17:57:02] <grym> dynamically translates bytecode programs to native machine code" 
[17:57:09] <grym> Guest3: python is of a kind with c# and java, here 
[17:57:43] <johnjay> e.g. save-interprogram-paste-before-kill, apropos-do-all, doc-view-continuous, and scroll-conservatively 100

[19:46:32] <imakestuff> krux02: yeah but
[19:46:35] <krux02> emacs did that in the 80s
[19:46:38] <imakestuff> RAM is made to be eaten

[19:47:19] <imakestuff> RAM is just something you can buy with money but your time is not. i think obsession with RAM is a thing of the past now 
[19:47:30] <krux02> imakestuff, you can't develop a program that eats all your RAM when all year ram is already eaten by your IDE
[19:47:38] <krux02> and Java works that way
[19:47:51] <imakestuff> but with the code insight it gives you, it's all worth it 
[19:47:53] <rdbeni0> i started with: pure emacs > vim > vim with ~30 plugins > experiments with modern IDE/editors electron/java based > spacemacs > and now again pure emacs with my config
[19:47:59] <krux02> it doesn't consume X amount of memory, it asks, how much do you have, yes that is exactly how much I need.
[19:48:02] <artefact> the distros are good showcases of what emacs can do. then after a while they get in the way, you get more proficient and know what you use/like so you can start over from scratch without being lost
[19:48:24] <imakestuff> hmmm 
[19:48:38] <imakestuff> what for instance is a lifesaver benefit you get from emacs 
[19:48:41] <imakestuff> ? 
[19:48:52] <imakestuff> that an IDE can't give you
[19:49:01] <imakestuff> i am just trying to get the idea of it 
[19:49:10] <krux02> imakestuff, but the real argument is, a program that eats all your ram also is slow. And intelliJ isn't the most responsive IDE out there. Emacs's isn't it either
[19:49:40] <imakestuff> I have M1 mac and responsiveness is not a criteria for me 
[19:49:49] <imakestuff> Intellij is fast enough for me 
[19:49:53] <krux02> ok
[19:49:56] <imakestuff> aside from that, what shall I expect? 
[19:50:12] <krux02> you should expect 0 seconds everywhere
[19:50:14] <artefact> i like that emacs is self-documenting and self-customizing. don't like how a function behave? just edit its source code, and see your changes right away
[19:50:24] <imakestuff> hmm nice

[19:51:41] <imakestuff> one thing i was hopeful for was org-mode 
[19:51:50] <krux02> imakestuff, the way you should see emacs isn't "emacs is a text editor" or "emacs is an idea", but emacs is a workshop that you you can adopt to all sorts of tasks, includin programming, writing, system administration, e-mail etc.
[19:51:57] <imakestuff> but not having native support for mobile is dealbreaker for me 
[19:52:06] <artefact> for me the main selling points are the community, the huge amount of packages, the ability to integrate virtually anything into emacs (x window manager? check. terminal? check. mail client? check. etc), and the default key bindings that are mostly mnemo-based instead of assuming you use qwerty
[19:52:08] <imakestuff> krux02: aha 
[19:52:14] <johnjay> i wonder what you would get taking the emacs tutorial and running back and forth through chinese google translate
[19:52:14] <krux02> In other words emacs isn't a program you launch, emacs launches your programs
[19:52:53] <imakestuff> I guess i'll try it and see for myself 
[19:52:54] <imakestuff> ;) 
[19:52:58] <rdbeni0> emacs is great for niche languages, less known and less popular langagues. I think for mainstream languages you can also use mainstream IDE/editors
[19:53:10] <krux02> imakestuff, if you want to go full in on emacs, there is exwm, so emacs becomes your window manager (not sure on osx though)
[19:53:25] <imakestuff> krux02: haha that's not going to happen 
[19:53:27] <rdbeni0> we hare around 300-400, or more, languages in the "market", not only top10 most popular languages
[19:53:34] <imakestuff> anytime soon atleast

[19:57:20] <krux02> if you have a command line tool that gets you the information you want to have, e.g. extract documentation, expand a macro, etc, its integration into emacs is trivial

[23:25:38] <dave`> find-file is not leaving those variables set for me.  It's obviously something to do with my configuration (doesn't happen with -Q)… but _what_?
[23:26:09] <thblt> dave`: when you say it doesn't take effect, do you mean the value isn't set (ie if you eval the variable in M-:) or just that indent doesn't do what you expect?
