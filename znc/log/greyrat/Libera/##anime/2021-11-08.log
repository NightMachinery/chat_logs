[02:10:04] <MootPoot> Everything is arbitrary by that definition
[02:10:27] <MootPoot> The sun going around happens to also be very useful for marking time 
[02:11:26] <amigojapan> MootPoot: yeah, and we should stop celebrating arbitrary holidays as if they were special
[02:11:43] <MootPoot> Why?
[02:11:53] <MootPoot> What does that do for us
[02:12:04] <amigojapan> Why not? Cause they are not important
[02:12:15] <MootPoot> So?
[02:12:38] <amigojapan> So let's ignore them and celebrate really important things
[02:12:42] <MootPoot> We pay attention to lots of things which are not important in our lives

[02:15:40] <amigojapan> Or Christmas
[02:15:59] <klaxa> but it's tradition
[02:16:01] <MootPoot> It's just by chance that a big explosion happed and then coincidentally one time according to the sun revolving turned out to be the best time to harvest....sounds arbitrary
[02:16:04] <klaxa> which is just peer pressure from dead people
[02:16:29] <amigojapan> klaxa: it's a bad tradition
[02:16:33] <emmeka> amigojapan do you find solstice-based holidays equally arbitrary
[02:16:50] <MootPoot> Sounds like going by amigos logic everything is arbitrary
[02:16:50] <klaxa> bunch of people don't think so though apparently

[02:18:25] <klaxa> yeah but it will take a while

[02:32:43] <Jigsy> I don't really bother with New Year.
[02:32:46] <Jigsy> I used too...
[02:32:49] <MootPoot> then why dont you celebrate it?
[02:32:58] <Jigsy> ...but then it felt weird to go "Whoo, a number increased by one! Whoo!"

[02:33:46] <tcsilver> tiny animals
[02:33:49] <tcsilver> what a show
[02:33:51] <emmeka> and thus must be celebrated

[02:33:58] <Jigsy> I beg to differ.

[02:34:05] * Jigsy beams proudly.
[02:34:08] <MootPoot> if we had real friends we'd take the chance at the holiday to take days off from work and go out on dates
[02:34:22] <Jigsy> We would?
[02:34:26] <Sxem> i thought i had friends in high school and college
[02:34:28] <MootPoot> probably
[02:34:33] <Jigsy> I wouldn't.
[02:34:35] <Sxem> but they disappeared right after graduation
[02:34:37] <amigojapan> emmeka: I think Passover is more about alcohol
[02:34:39] <Jigsy> I like being at home.
[02:34:55] <MootPoot> emmeka: how much alcohol is max alcohol
[02:35:06] <Jigsy> Sxem: In mysterious circumstances?
[02:35:10] <MootPoot> like whole bottle of wine or are we talking liver damage and blindness
[02:35:28] <Sxem> nope
[02:35:33] <Jigsy> A pint of absinthe, MootPoot.
[02:35:43] <Sxem> ive never tried absinthe,
[02:35:52] <Jigsy> Followed by a pint of creme de minthe as a chaser.
[02:36:05] <emmeka> MootPoot if a glass of wine is a 1 and alcohol poisoning is a 10, maybe a 7
[02:36:31] <Jigsy> I guess max alcohol is when you start to feel inebriated.
[02:36:35] <Jigsy> So in my case, one pint.
[02:36:52] <Jigsy> Hell, probably half that.
[02:38:07] <amigojapan> Jigsy: how many millilitres in a pint?

[03:29:45] <MootPoot> now I can just eat once and not even notice I'm hungry or have a headache/tired for like 8+ hours
[03:30:06] <ButterNoodle> yea thats the problems w carbs
[03:30:09] <ButterNoodle> they are easily digested
[03:31:07] <Cryowolf> not if you get slow carbs :P
[03:31:22] <ButterNoodle> slow carbs?

[03:31:44] <ButterNoodle> yea
[03:31:55] <Cryowolf> lol

[03:33:59] <Cryowolf> wheat berries too
[03:35:23] <Cryowolf> brown rice too
[03:35:37] <Cryowolf> there's a lot that doesnt cause your blood sugar to crash

[03:37:23] <ButterNoodle> if u have 50 in ur city.. probably only 2 are used regularly
[03:37:44] <MootPoot> bah
[03:37:47] <Cryowolf> but fast carbs are good if used properly

[11:00:41] <MootPoot> Yeah that's why you don't get cheap garbage 
[11:00:58] <MootPoot> My definition of cheap and yours is pretty different
[11:01:08] <MootPoot> Cheap for me would be 300-450 usd 
[11:01:51] <amigojapan> MootPoot: my current phone was 300usd but it's pretty good
[11:02:06] <MootPoot> If you start going below that costs are cut in very bad ways

[11:03:08] <amigojapan> Abuse them*
[11:03:14] <MootPoot> This current one is at about 1.2 years 
[11:03:26] <MootPoot> amigojapan: things are built to be used 
[11:03:29] <Bco1981> pretty hard to find a phone that actually feels like an upgrade from a Galaxy S7
[11:03:42] <MootPoot> It's not like I physically break them 
[11:03:48] <Bco1981> and still stays below 5.5"
[11:04:34] <MootPoot> My last few phones died from = charger short circuit, battery died with no replacement , and circuit board shorting out 
[11:04:57] <MootPoot> Oh also on my op5 the network chip stopped working 
[11:05:39] <MootPoot> Bco1981: I think its best you drop the 5.5 for a 6
[11:05:56] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I don't think those things happen from normal use
[11:06:25] <MootPoot> 5.5 and 6 feels the same since newer phones have no bezels imo
[11:06:38] <Bco1981> no. if i can't have it in my pocket, i'll take a nokia 6300 next instead.
[11:06:50] <MootPoot> ?
[11:06:58] <MootPoot> do you wear skinny jeans or something
[11:07:06] <Bco1981> just jeans... i think

[11:36:10] <Cryowolf> maybe it should be called ShortER circuit
[11:39:29] <amigojapan> Bco1981: are you are that is what "short out"means? I think it means the ground and the positive are in contact
[11:39:50] <amigojapan> !c short out
[11:39:51] <ImoutoBot> amigojapan: I don't know.
[11:39:56] <amigojapan> Hmm
[11:40:04] <Bco1981> there is a shorter connection to ground.
[11:40:26] <amigojapan> Bco1981: it bypasses the load
[11:40:49] <amigojapan> Or part of the load
[11:42:16] <amigojapan> I am really not an expert in electronics tho
[11:43:04] <Cryowolf> short circuit really means a connection shorter than the one being used, resulting in a much higher amperage running across connections that werent meant to handle that
[11:43:13] <Cryowolf> "shorting" the mout
[11:44:17] <amigojapan> Alright
[11:44:36] <Cryowolf> thats why circuit boards are divided up into a lot of these paths running across it that have just been made to look nicer

[14:33:00] <JesseDesu> procreate is easy for someone who knows photoshop
[14:33:14] <Urchin[emacs]> I've only done some basic picture editing with GIMP
[14:33:33] <JesseDesu> gimp doesnt follow industry standards for button iconology
[14:33:50] <JesseDesu> so its very difficult for someone who understands photoshop to get into gimp
[14:34:05] <JesseDesu> i use gimp recently but only for basic stuff like cropping and resizing
[14:34:32] <JesseDesu> its like gimp intentionally set out to be as different as possible from photoshop
[14:34:51] <JesseDesu> thats the same way corel painter did their program
[14:35:20] <Urchin[emacs]> I have no idea what "industry standards for button iconology" are
[14:35:35] <JesseDesu> i'm talking about adobe
[14:35:49] <Urchin[emacs]> and, yes, I do know people find switching to GIMP from photoshop find it difficult
[14:36:05] <Urchin[emacs]> flip side, I once tried using Photoshop, and found it unusable
[14:36:12] <JesseDesu> and for office suites, microsoft of course
[14:36:19] <JesseDesu> yea thats understandable
[14:36:34] <JesseDesu> learning one translates zero to the other

[16:20:24] <JesseDesu> :[
[16:21:04] <TsundereNoises> JesseDesu: sorry, that was maybe harsh, but i'm not really awake and it reminds me of how people take writing critique
[16:21:28] <rodent> TsundereNoises: <- Do I just do this to mention people?
[16:21:30] <TsundereNoises> a lot of people get NOTHING out of writing workshops because any time anyone gives them a criticism they ask around for someone to tell them it's okay so they can dismiss it
[16:21:45] <TsundereNoises> rodent: it helps because it highlights the message of the person you mentioned
[16:21:54] <rodent> Also what are we critiquing
[16:22:08] <TsundereNoises> rodent: you don't really have to if you're in the middle of talking to that person, but it clarifies things if there's a lot of crosstalk, or if you're talking to multiple people at once
[16:22:12] <JesseDesu> rodent, critiqueing a drawing
[16:22:17] <TsundereNoises> like how I'm having 3 different conversations right now
[16:22:42] <rodent> I see. Can I have a link to the drawing?
[16:22:58] <TsundereNoises> it helps to name people if they've been gone, or if your message might be lost among a bunch of other messages, so some people just do it all the time
[16:23:10] <rodent> TsundereNoises: Thanks for the explanation

[16:26:55] <JesseDesu> i think its an acceptable design compromise

[16:28:04] <JesseDesu> you can be harsh

[23:28:00] <TsundereNoises> but as is, I think you're lying

[23:29:47] <Jigsy> [19:56:06] <TsundereNoises> it weirds me out that she unbuttoned her shirt all the way without undoing the tie
[23:29:51] <Jigsy> The tie makes it better.
[23:30:19] <dweltstorm> did she like have the tie on under the shirt or???
[23:30:37] <dweltstorm> because ties go around the shirt
[23:30:37] <TsundereNoises> dweltstorm: exactly! it's very confusing how she got to be in that state!
[23:30:45] <ImoutoBot> New episode for: Kyoukai Senki | Episode: 6
[23:30:48] <TsundereNoises> I mean she obviously loosened it
[23:31:02] <TsundereNoises> but you'd think you'd just undo the not before you got to the unbuttoning your last shirt button stage
[23:31:31] <dweltstorm> this channel is always either about engineering projects or hentai
[23:31:38] <dweltstorm> there is no in between
[23:31:41] <TsundereNoises> why not both?
[23:31:58] <hentai> dweltstorm, Is it about me?
[23:32:38] <dweltstorm> TsundereNoises: that would make to be an interesting discussion
[23:34:07] <dweltstorm> hentai: no. Its about drive, its about power.

[23:40:01] <hentai> I am a resident of #gentoo-chat, and all other channels are left open just for the lulz

[23:41:01] <hentai> dweltstorm, I just took the first thing I thought of, and made it into my username
