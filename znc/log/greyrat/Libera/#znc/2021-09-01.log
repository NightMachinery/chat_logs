[01:04:01] <aead> Just set up ZNC. Didn't deviate much from the default config. It's disconnecting from Libera when my client (Weechat) quits. I can't find any reason in the config, nor the docs/FAQ. Any ideas? 
[01:07:00] <MetaNova> my first thought is that you weren't actually connected to ZNC, but it seems you are
[01:07:14] <predicament> ^
[01:08:02] <aead> No it's definitely working. I can do stuff via *status 
[01:08:03] <predicament> so do you have any other networks?  are you trusting PKI?
[01:08:20] <predicament> you're definitely connected through the bouncer yes
[01:08:51] <aead> No other networks. I'm not trusting the bouncer's self generated cert 
[01:09:07] <predicament> you should
[01:09:14] <aead> Would that cause this issue?
[01:10:29] <predicament> um im not qualified to help honestly.  i can only make suggestions, ask questions.   it.. could?  what error do you get when you get d/c?

[01:16:07] <MetaNova> aead: how do you know ZNC is disconnecting from libera when you disconnect your client?
[01:16:22] <DarthGandalf> ^ sniped
[01:17:01] <aead> I see the Libera welcome message, I see my own joins in every channel, and I don't seem to get any appreciable scrollback 
[01:18:35] <Khaytsus> Go ahead and quit weechat
[01:18:36] <Khaytsus> And btw if you have mulitple clients connected you're not going to see history 
[01:18:36] <DarthGandalf> It's correct to see your own joins
[01:18:36] <DarthGandalf> and the welcome message
[01:18:36] <DarthGandalf> re scrollback, maybe noone was talking without you?
[01:18:36] <DarthGandalf> or maybe you set buffer size to 0
[01:18:36] <MetaNova> aead: you will always see the welcome message, and your joins, because as far as your client knows, you are just connecting
[01:18:36] <Khaytsus> And maybe like a lot of folks he's using mulitple clients
[01:19:15] <Khaytsus> Seems to be the most common reason anyway
[01:19:25] <aead> No, I was seeing the server's wall message/MOTD on join. It seems to have stopped after I just changed a handful of things. Just to confirm, do I have a join in this channel at :44 of the hour?

[01:25:00] <predicament> aead, that's how it should be :)
[01:25:04] <predicament> you're fine
[01:25:52] <predicament> and Khaytsus you can see history with multiple clients
[01:26:19] <DarthGandalf> Not with the default settings
[01:26:26] <predicament> default settings no
[01:26:45] <predicament> gotta configure that part
[01:27:04] <DarthGandalf> maybe the configuration wizard should ask whether multiple clients are going to be used...
[01:27:27] <Khaytsus> I have thought that should be simpler.  Or heck, maybe just default.  What does it hurt?
[01:27:53] <DarthGandalf> It hurts by seeing the same scrollback again and again even if you have only a single client
[01:28:14] <Khaytsus> huh?  
[01:28:25] <DarthGandalf> without using some modules which are not even shipped with ZNC
[01:28:30] <Khaytsus> If you set the clientid and it's set up right...
[01:29:05] <DarthGandalf> clientid is ignored by the core
[01:29:09] <predicament> it gets annoying
[01:29:20] <Khaytsus> But yeah, never have understood why some of those modules aren't in core znc
[01:29:21] <predicament> the same scrollback over and over
[01:29:29] <DarthGandalf> because they were never added?
[01:29:51] <predicament> DarthGandalf, should they be?
[01:29:55] <predicament> (added)
[01:30:01] <DarthGandalf> no idea
[01:30:16] <DarthGandalf> I never felt need for them, because I have one client
[01:30:34] <predicament> well
[01:30:36] <DarthGandalf> so I never looked how it works even
[01:30:46] <predicament> i use two boxes
[01:30:50] <Khaytsus> I'm always connnected from 2 or 3 clients...  but generally don't care about scrollback really
[01:31:10] <predicament> i do
[01:31:14] <gothkat> i usually want to see a bit of context when i switch clients
[01:31:17] <predicament> im big with that because OCD and logs.
[01:31:30] <predicament> and timestamps
[01:31:43] <gothkat> And a different amount ideally. i don't need 800 lines flowing to my phone 
[01:32:21] <gothkat> I eventually want to figure out how to log at znc and sync them to my computer so that my client doesn't need to log anything but I can search locally.
[01:32:32] <Khaytsus> gothkat: rsync?
[01:32:38] <MetaNova> rsync via cron job
[01:33:04] <Khaytsus> I still use my irssi logs for my chatdb, but I eventually need to just switch to my znc logs..  Less fuss, really.
[01:33:17] <Khaytsus> Should just work, just haven't bothered
[01:34:12] <predicament> maybe i should use irssi or weechat

[21:50:28] <Error> hi have compiled znc with modtcl and loaded it but when im trying to add a command ( example : bind pub - !ping pubPing; proc pubPing {nick uhost handle chan arg} {putquick "privmsg $chan :$nick: pong"} ) its giving me invalid command name "bind" this error..... what im doing wrong?
[22:05:50] <DarthGandalf> [[modtcl]]
[22:05:50] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/modtcl
[22:06:29] <DarthGandalf> do you need this to be on tcl at all?
[22:06:35] <Error> im doing what it says on the wiki
[22:06:43] <Error> but still cannot get it work
[22:07:28] <DarthGandalf> so you loaded modtcl.tcl?
[22:07:34] <Error> yes
[22:07:54] <DarthGandalf> and putquick by itself works?
[22:08:55] <Error> nah cannot get it working
[22:09:24] <DarthGandalf> can you do what you want to do using C++, perl or python instead?
[22:10:53] <DarthGandalf> but... I don't know
[22:11:01] <DarthGandalf> perhaps znc -D will show something useful?

[22:45:19] <boxybox> Is there a way I can get znc to stop logging and displaying the topic message when I rejoin a channel?
[22:49:13] <knolle> no, you'll have to do that in your client
