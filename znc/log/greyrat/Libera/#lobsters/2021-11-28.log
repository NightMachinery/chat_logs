[01:25:09] <hoistbypetard> even though i feel like i only rely on github to contribute to other peoples' projects these days, having it down when i'm trying to spin up a new project just taught me otherwise
[01:25:18] <riv> this is a big gh outage
[01:26:10] <hoistbypetard> yeah.
[01:28:23] <hoistbypetard> i was not consciously aware that, for example, by standard process for setting up black (one of the PSF lint tools) as a precommit hook in my personal (not on github) repos requires access to https://github.com/psf/black

[01:34:42] <manicennui> hoistbypetard: Still seems down
[01:34:47] <manicennui> mockturtle is special
[01:36:06] <hoistbypetard> it was back up just long enough for my `poetry run pre-commit autoupdate` command to get past its check of `psf/black`, at least.
[01:36:56] <hoistbypetard> i habitually do that when i start a new project. guess i shouldn't.

[03:02:14] <iDrougge> pe: I guess Apple intended for stupid sorting algorithms to sort in a slightly less stupid way by storing filenames that way.
[03:02:33] <iDrougge> Of course, the storage format should be of no consequence if you use the correct APIs.
[03:03:40] <pe> My actual problem with it is that Syncthing is desperately trying to NFC-normalize directories.
[03:04:11] <pe> Or is it NKC.

[03:06:45] <pe> And random programs breaking if you use them on a case-sensitive FS (it can be created).

[03:37:00] <aandrew> pe: well to be honest I'm syncing a directory tree that doesn't have mixed case issues
[03:38:22] <aandrew> it is big (73G) and sync'd across 3 OSX machines and two Linux machines, one of which is remote and has versioning turned on
[03:38:24] <pe> I have about 200k files, God knows what's in there.
[03:39:01] <aandrew> 740k files, 120k directories
[03:39:19] <aandrew> amazing how good syncthing works, IMO. Love it
[03:39:46] <aandrew> then the remote server actually does incremental backups to S3 with duplicity, been doing that for... must be a decade now or close to it
[03:39:59] <aandrew> the biggest issue with that is that I constantly forget how to restore since I do it so infrequently

[03:43:30] <aandrew> but syncthing is smart enough that it keeps trying to sync those but doesn't block -- other file changes are sync'd right and it comes back to try these over and over
