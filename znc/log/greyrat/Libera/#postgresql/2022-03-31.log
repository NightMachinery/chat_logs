[01:01:41] <harpia> I have this database using encoding LATIN1, and then I retrieve data from it with PHP (PDO). It's annoying having to convert strings to UTF-8 every time I want to put them in a JSON. Is there a way to convert everything on-the-fly to UTF-8? I'm not allowed to change the encoding of the database.
[01:02:04] <concrete-houses> is analzye more important than vacuum?
[01:03:45] <peerce> harpia; client encoding can be different than database encoding all versions since quite awhile ago
[01:04:18] <peerce> concrete-houses; is the engine more important than the brakes?

Normaly we want only one relation to be allowed between two objects.

[10:31:53] <Guest5279> the time to ensure that? serializable is not an option - i cant ensure that on every transaction

[14:33:00] <marahin> Hi. I'm facing an issue where an app (that has some level of concurrency) is seemingly exceeding connections in my psql. I even set max_connections to 100, but: at any point in time during ~10 minutes when i was observing the log errors, total connections shown in DBeaver did not exceed ~60
[14:33:14] <marahin> SELECT COUNT(*) from pg_stat_activity; also returned a number between 20 and ~40
[14:33:31] <marahin> yet I'm facing regular errors like: FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for non-replication superuser connections (SQLSTATE 53300)
[14:34:22] <marahin> Google tells me its a connection issue, that I'm not closign connections somewhere, or I just have to set max_connections to a higher limit. `show max_connections;` returns 100 as of right now, and well... The connections more or less add up to what I need and use in the app. I don't think it's related to not closing connections properly.
[14:34:49] <marahin> Postgres is deployed in a Kubernetes cluster in a form of a single pod deployment.
[14:34:57] <marahin> Image used is `postgres:12`
[14:36:37] <Berge> marahin: Sounds like you have brief peaks of >95 connections, then
[14:36:48] <Berge> Consider using a pooler, such as pgbouncer
[14:37:04] <Berge> Or consider configuring your clients so that they don't open that many connections
[14:37:22] <Berge> Do you log connections and disconnections? You should be able to make some stats based on that
[14:37:28] <marahin> Berge: but for this reason I started DBeaver and went into the built in dashboard - at no point (even though errors were coming up) this postgres instance exceeded ~70 total connections.
[14:37:43] <Berge> marahin: But that's sampling
[14:37:53] <marahin> Mhm.
[14:37:57] <Berge> It's probably just doing SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_stat_activity; at some interval
[14:38:03] <marahin> Understandable
[14:38:05] <Berge> I wouldn't know, I don't use DBeaver
[14:38:24] <marahin> Alright, I'll give it a shot with pgBouncer
[14:38:25] <Berge> I agree it doesn't sound like you have lingering connections.
[14:38:25] <marahin> Thank you.

[14:44:12] <marahin> all i have here is "production" so friends or colleagues access it, but it's not "production" in a business sense - none of that is monetizing or self-sustainable and hence no guarantees of quality to anyone:)

[14:44:23] <marahin> and also it's really small databases, all of them less then 10GB I think.
[14:44:25] <Berge> Well, I suppose you can, yes, if you have superuser access setup
[14:44:32] <Berge> …which is more complex without unix sockets (-:
[14:44:37] <koollman> Berge: doesn't matter where the data is, really, as long as you can point pg_dump and psql to it
[14:45:05] <marahin> I'd assume the most primitive way would be to dump data -> upgrade it locally to pg14 -> upgrade the deployment to pg14 -> restore data
[14:45:07] <Berge> koollman: …and can authenticat3e
[14:45:09] <Berge> s/3//
[14:45:32] <Berge> which I maintain is much more straight forward with "sudo -u postgres -i" than figuring out whatever pg_hba.conf stuff a random Docker image has setup
[14:45:36] <koollman> Berge: well, yeah. But that, too, is supposed to work. a db you cannot connect to isn't very useful :)

[15:07:14] <maret> I am running an update query Update entities SET entities.group_id = groups_id FROM groups where entitities.hash = groups.hash. on a large table with 9 billions rows. There are no indexes right now so query is already taking 20hours. Reason why there are no indexes is, that those tables are new and I wanted to remove hash columns which are unique identifiers with bigserial column.
[15:08:22] <maret> Now I am not sure if its worth to cancel the query, create indexes which I guess will take several hours too and run the query again. Or update original source files for the tables (around 100GB of CSV files) and replace hash for integer values
[15:08:25] *** michelle_ is now known as Michelle
[15:10:08] <maret> Related question -> Is UPDATE query where XYZ like this comparable with SELECT query with the same WHERE condition , time wise?
[15:10:49] <maret> I am asking mainly to figure out whats the longest that this whole update can still take
[15:10:53] <maret> aproximatelly
[15:11:16] <ilmari> maret: plus the time taken to actually write the updated rows. `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) UPDATE …`will show both (and also do the update, so do it in a transaction you roll back if you don't want that)
[15:12:09] <Berge> And plus the time it takes to check any FKs
[15:12:20] <Berge> And run any triggers
[15:12:41] <ilmari> yeah
[15:13:07] <maret> ilmari so lets say I will run this update for just one row so I would change condition from where  where entitities.hash = groups.has tom where entities.hash = 'somehash'; and lets say it would take 10 seconds for one row. Can I aproximate how much it will take to update all rows based on that?
[15:13:10] <Berge> And deal with write amplification, if applicable
[15:13:13] <ilmari> add VERBOSE to EXPLAIN option list to see how long each trigger took
[15:13:32] <maret> really what I am asking here is should I cancel the update already running for almost a day, run indexes and run it again or just wait (or to do maybe something else)
[15:13:48] <Berge> maret: The longest runtime is approximately the hardware's lifespan (-:
[15:13:56] <maret> :D
[15:14:14] <maret> or my, whichever comes first
[15:14:24] <Berge> Nah, the query will go on even if you expire
[15:14:26] <maret> because if I am not watching query riunning, does it still run :P
[15:15:26] <maret> Anyway what do you think, should I stop update query, create indexes and run it again?
[15:15:52] <ilmari> yes
[15:16:16] <Berge> maret: Out of curiosity, what sort of data is this+
[15:17:06] <maret> what do you mean exactly?
[15:17:08] <ilmari> looking at the query, it looks like you're changing the foreign key from the hash to a surrogate key?
[15:17:25] <ilmari> why?
[15:17:30] <maret> yeah although the hash is not used as FK right now
[15:17:50] <Berge> maret: What does the data represent? It's a reasonably big database.
[15:18:02] <Berge> Like, sensor events, for instance?
[15:18:51] <maret> the reason is that I want to use bigint instead of hash as primary key for better performance. There isnt really any reason why use hash, data just came with it
[15:20:57] <ilmari> what data type and how long is the hash?
[15:21:13] <ilmari> and how did you determine that that was the bottleneck?

[15:29:35] <maret> i just don't see a reason to keep it like that , when it takes more space and might be slower later on compared to simple bigserial
[15:30:04] <Berge> Why do you think that?
[15:30:20] <Berge> Slower for what?
[15:30:29] <kjetilho> Berge: 64 > 8 ;)
[15:30:34] <Berge> (=
[15:31:09] <maret> so my plan seem to be 1. Cancel update 2. Create an index  on hash 3. Update entities.group_id  4. drop hash , add index on group_id column
[15:31:46] <Berge> kjetilho: To be fair, bytea would be one byte larger on disk
[15:31:47] <maret> Berge had discussion here yesterday and in AFAIK in principle comparing bigint should be faster than strings, but I repeat my self here. No reason for me to  keep the string in table
[15:31:56] <Berge> It's one byte plus payload, iirc
[15:32:12] <ilmari> Berge: but it would be half the size of the current text representation
[15:32:25] <Berge> ilmari: Absolutely
[15:32:30] <maret> so I am only deciding how to update it the fastes
[15:32:41] <Berge> Why do you store them if you don't need them?
[15:32:50] <ilmari> maret: you don't need it for reference to any external entity (e.g. for subsequent updates of the data)?
[15:33:09] <maret> I don't want to store them , I am planning to drop it after update
[15:33:11] <maret> ilmari nope
[15:33:36] <Berge> Why are you storing it in the first place, then?
[15:34:04] <ilmari> note that dropping the column won't actually free up any space
[15:34:24] <maret> thanks will keep that in mind
[15:34:44] <ilmari> the space will only get reclaimed as rows get updated, and the new version gets written without the data
[15:35:48] <maret> btw so i need to create indexes for both columns in where clause right? (entitities.hash = groups.hash)

[19:28:33] <robin44> hello all! i am here seeking the intuition of experts! i am wondering which of these is better:
[19:29:06] <robin44> i want to have one of my api endpoints return a list of conversations with their most recent messages, and i have two ways of doing it:
[19:29:31] <robin44> a) query the list of conversations and then also jsonb_agg the 50 most recent messages for each (such that it is returned in a single database query)
[19:29:51] <robin44> b) do two separate database queries. one for the list of conversations, and one for the list of 50 most recent messages for each (using a lateral join)
[19:30:36] <robin44> here's why it's a predicament: using jsonb_agg adds significantly to the query processing time. this can be solved by doing two separate queries. but _then_ you have the overhead of doing two separate queries
[19:31:25] <robin44> so i'm not sure which is "better". because with `a)` you strain the database, but with `b)` it likely results in a longer api response time because it has to do query 1, wait for the results, then do query 2, and _then_ return both
[19:31:53] <robin44> ideally there'd be a way to return both queries in a single database call, such that only a single round trip is needed, but i'm not sure if that's possible, because they both return completely different result sets
[19:31:55] <robin44> any advice?

[20:05:54] *** Joins: digimer (~digimer@198.96.117.110)
[20:06:37] <robin44> also ilmari not to keep drilling this same point but i am still confused so i'll reiterate regardless: does jsonb_agg have an overhead or no? because crunchy seemed to somewhat imply that it doesn't, but my explain analyze seems to indicate that it does? so i'm not sure what the truth is
[20:07:16] <robin44> if it does indeed have an overhead, would two separate queries be better, latency be damned? or in the cost benefit analysis is it better to have a tiny bit of overhead in a query as opposed to an overhead of having to run two queries? i'm not sure
[20:07:49] <digimer> Hi all, I've got an interesting issue I was hoping for guidance on... I have two separate databases on two hosts that our software writes to for redundancy. Periodically, I want to count the number of records in a given table on each DB to ensure they both have the same data. The trick is, while I do these counts, other clients could write data causing one count to differ from the other, simple because a write happened after I couted on table and befor
[20:08:07] <ilmari> json_agg() does work. doing work takes time. just returning the rows without aggregation is less work.
[20:08:34] <ilmari> to measure the actual overhead, try both and compare, with realistic data amounts and system load
[20:08:36] <digimer> So I plan to try using locks, but I was hoping to get some clarity on how these work. If I set a table lock, and another client tries to write, does it simply fail, or does the write wait for the lock to be released?
[20:09:04] <robin44> but i did exactly that? ah oh well i'll just play with it some more. i suppose this sort of question is too nebulous for a proper answer. my apologies

[20:09:46] <robin44> okay one moment i'll try that
[20:10:28] <ilmari> one advantage of fetching the messages separately is that you could do it lazily and concurrently, for lower perceived latency (depending on your application UI and architecture)

[20:11:46] <robin44> oh i was thinking about just doing it in a single api request regardless

[20:15:28] <ilmari> digimer: other writes will wait while the table is locked. but it won't solve anything, since just like a client could insert something between the two counts, it could insert something between the time you lock the first table and the second
[20:15:41] <johto> gastus; what do you mean? "turns out to be a string"?

[23:22:26] <ksynwa> Facing a very weird problem where I cannot clear up a table: https://dpaste.org/VJEC/raw
[23:22:35] <ksynwa> It's a simple table with no foreign constraints too.
[23:22:41] <ksynwa> Any idea what I am doing wrong?
[23:23:48] <peerce> \d comment
[23:25:10] <ksynwa> peerce: Output = https://dpaste.org/HTWe/raw
[23:25:32] <peerce> could your delete trigger be blocking the delete ?
[23:25:33] <digimer> I'm reading on locks, and maybe I'm being dense, but I'm hoping for some help clarifying... I want to make a table read-only temporarily, and have any INSERT/UPDATE hold until the lock is replaced. I'm reading this - https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/explicit-locking.html
[23:25:47] <ksynwa> Yeah probably something is up with that. Will have to check.
[23:25:50] <peerce> Triggers:
[23:25:51] <peerce>     comment_event_delete BEFORE DELETE ON comment FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION notify_event('comment', 'id')
[23:25:52] <ksynwa> Thanks man.
[23:26:45] <peerce> i'm not a fan of triggers for exactly this sort of thing
[23:28:16] <robin44> does anyone have any idea why my lateral join isn't sorting properly? i'm doing a long query that includes a `LEFT JOIN LATERAL (SELECT * FROM x ORDER BY x.id DESC LIMIT 50)` and for whatever reason it seems like it's not ordering them properly
[23:28:51] <johto> the output isn't ordered based on that ORDER BY
[23:28:56] <johto> (necessarily, anyway)
[23:29:10] <robin44> any idea why? and is there a way to fix it?
[23:29:23] <johto> add an ORDER BY into the outer query
[23:29:41] <robin44> oh wait a second i think i see what you're saying
[23:29:50] <robin44> (maybe)
[23:30:05] <johto> SELECT * FROM .. LEFT JOIN LATERAL (..) ss ORDER BY <here>;
[23:30:06] <robin44> you're saying that it will return the proper data (the most 50 recent items), but those 50 items aren't ordered?
[23:30:16] <johto> correct
[23:30:26] <robin44> okay, then it's fine. i'll just order on the client (browser)
[23:30:33] <robin44> just wanted to make sure i wasn't missing data

[23:38:11] <robin44> all i did was change my query from `SELECT * FROM ...` to `WITH x AS (SELECT * FROM ..) SELECT *, (CASE WHEN jsonb_array_length(messages) = 50 THEN false ELSE true END) finished FROM x` and the runtime went from 1.2 milliseconds to 3.6 milliseconds
[23:38:40] <robin44> if i cut off that last part (and keep the CTE), it runs in 1.2 ms
[23:38:58] <robin44> so it's not the CTE that's doing it, it's simply the column that checks the array length
[23:39:26] <robin44> oh well i'll just do that on the client too
[23:39:32] <robin44> no big deal
[23:40:40] *** Joins: Auron (~Auron956@user/auron)
[23:43:51] <peerce> milliseconds suggest the query is dealing with a trivial amount of data.
[23:45:08] <peerce> what about  SELECT *, (CASE WHEN jsonb_array_length(messages) = 50 THEN false ELSE true END) finished FROM ...  ?
[23:45:46] <peerce> parsing json does take some time.
[23:46:01] <peerce> that doesn't even need to be a case.
[23:46:12] <robin44> wait how is yours different?
[23:46:20] <peerce> what about  SELECT *, (jsonb_array_length(messages) <> 50)  finished FROM ...  ?
[23:46:21] <raptelan> How can I do a query where I get a maximum of say 10 rows per value in a given column?  For example, if I want max of 10 tables per schema from pg_tables?
[23:46:26] <peerce> no CTE needed.
[23:46:58] <robin44> i believe i need a CTE or otherwise it says `messages` does not exist
[23:47:31] <peerce> um, messages is not part of whatever .... table ?  then your original CTE based statement was rather incomplete of critical information
[23:48:06] <robin44> sorry no messages is in the query as follows: `COALESCE((SELECT json_agg(messages) FROM usp_get_convo_replies(c.convo_id, 9223372036854775807, $1) as messages), '[]') messages`

[23:48:42] <robin44> huh? nuh uh
[23:48:48] <raptelan> lol
[23:48:57] <ilmari> raptelan: select n.nspname, r.relname from pg_namespace n, lateral (select relname from pg_class c where c.relnamespace = n.oid order by relname limit 10) c;
[23:49:06] <raptelan> I tried repainting it red, yet the dang light is still on!
[23:49:16] <johto> instead of doing a json_array_length(json_agg()), you could just do a LATERAL which aggregates and counts
[23:49:45] <robin44> the reason i'm not doing a lateral join is because i already have a function called get_convo_replies which would do exactly what the lateral does
[23:49:57] <robin44> and rather than repeating the sql logic i can just call the function
[23:50:22] <ilmari> robin44: did you compare the performance of that vs. the lateral?
[23:50:35] <robin44> yeah it's 1ms vs 1.2 ms (with the function)
[23:50:43] <robin44> so lateral is a bit faster but not enough to make it worth duplicating sql logic imo
[23:50:48] <ilmari> and it's the subquery that's lateral, not the join
[23:50:56] <raptelan> I found a whole bunch of string_to_array (string_agg (foo, ','), ',') bits in some queries, lol.
[23:51:17] <peerce> assuming the raw data isn't already in json, using json_agg then json_array_lenght is going to be way slower than count(...)
[23:51:31] <raptelan> ilmari: awesome, I need to get familiar with lateral again, haven't used it in ages and forgot all about it.
[23:51:36] <robin44> the raw data is not in json, correct

[23:56:02] <ilmari> raptelan: you mean if you don't have a separate table with just the values you want to get the N other values by?
[23:56:39] <ilmari> this is why you should use your actual use case when asking questions, not some other thing …
[23:57:25] <ilmari> OTOH, my first question about that would have been "do you have a separate table for the entities you want n related entities for"
[23:59:02] <ilmari> you _could_ do: select a.*, b.* from (select distinct a from the_table) a, lateral (select b.b from the_table b where a.a = b.a order by x limit 10) b; but that's horribly inefficient
