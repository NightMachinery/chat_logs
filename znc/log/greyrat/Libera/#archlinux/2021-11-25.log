[04:53:18] <kevr> vd: 550M is a pretty nice size. It truly depends on your needs. If it's purely hosting efi stubs, you likely do not need 550M. But if it's hosting kernels, 550M is pretty safe to go for arch.
[04:53:31] <kevr> I personally use a 1G boot partition and a 100MB efi partition.
[04:54:09] <kevr> but if you're liberal with your disk space, might as well go with 550M.

[04:59:21] <vd> I'm aiming for the simple (yet flexible) layout
[04:59:52] <kevr> or you could mount it to like /efi or /boot/efi, leaving the kernels to your root partition

[06:41:25] <MacGyver> Can't get any more lightweight really -- you'll have to actually get the youtube links from elsewhere like a browser.
[06:41:39] <jirido> will it download next song in the playlist while playing?

[06:43:48] <Repentinus> yt-dlp performs only the downloads.
[06:43:53] <MacGyver> You asked for a player. yt-dlp is not a player, it's only a downloader.
[06:43:59] <jirido> ok
[06:43:59] <MacGyver> You'll still have to point a player at the result.

[09:51:07] <tsdh> I have enabled DNSOverTLS in /etc/systemd/resolved.conf with the dnsforge.de servers.  Basically, it works but for some reason I cannot ping some hosts which I can perfectly well browse with firefox.
[09:52:15] <grawity> by "cannot ping" do you mean it reports name lookup failure or do you mean it dosn't get a reply to the actual pings
[09:52:47] <tsdh> For example, I can neither ping fritz.box (my router at home) nor my homepage tsdh.org.  The error is "From thinkpad-t440p (fe80::2ad2:44ff:fe4c:14f1%enp0s25) icmp_seq=4 Destination unreachable: Address unreachable".
[09:53:12] <grawity> so that's because you've put a link-local IPv6 address in your DNS for tsdh.org
[09:53:16] <grawity> don't do that
[09:53:37] <grawity> as for fritz.box, it doesn't exist, so it's normal that it won't work
[09:53:57] <grawity> it only worked before because your router intercepts the query and gives you a fake response
[09:54:07] <grawity> but of course the main point of DoT is to avoid that
[09:54:12] <tsdh> Gosh, how did I do that, the link-local IPv6 address?

[12:06:35] <sheep> dd makes an exact, byte-for-byte copy, including the partition table
[12:07:11] <sheep> you should not use dd though. It also copies all of the unused space, and it doesn't assign new UUIDs for the partitions or filesystems
[12:07:17] <Tom^> Ygnas: well your ssd is just filled with bytes, and when you dd you copy byte per byte. so yeah. the new disk might be bigger or smaller meaning the FS might be extending out of its boundary or below it. tho
[12:07:21] <Ygnas> So it should be able to boot if the first ssd has removable grub and works on any pc
[12:07:26] <sheep> and it can't handle devices that are smaller than the source device

[13:40:10] <Repentinus> Usually the DVD drive is fastened with a single screw approximately in the middle of the laptop. Remove that and just slide it out.
[13:40:16] <Gagis> I used one of those on my old laptop, was an excellent idea, tho I think I paid full price for one
[13:40:20] <Repentinus> (The screw may be below the bottom cover though.)
[13:40:29] <Gagis> mine was accessible under the battery
[13:40:32] <grawity> + some chewing gum to hold it in place because it's "universal" and nowhere near the neat fit of your original CD drive

I'm reading up on condition variables a bit and especially the case where you use one of the two cases to signal a thread: 1) lock/signal(cv)/unlock OR just 2) signal(cv). Where `cv` is a condition variable. I read that when a signaled thread wakes up it must block on the mutex. Is that right?

[15:51:29] <Velkorq> by the way is there a way to boot in uefi mode, a gpt partition table, but without have to use that annoying fat32 partition?
[15:51:37] <jkc> No.
[15:51:55] <jkc> UEFI boot means EFI System Partition. ESP means FAT32.
[15:51:57] <Velkorq> is it a grub limitation or a specification limitation?
[15:52:04] <jkc> UEFI spec requires it.
[15:52:26] <Velkorq> thats one reason i want to go back to legacy
[15:52:41] <jkc> Because you have to create a partition?
[15:52:45] <demize> That's not entirely true.  The spec requires FAT32 to be supported, but doesn't require that it be the only supported thing.  Most firmware doesn't support anything else though.
[15:52:56] <Velkorq> does fat32 even have journaling?
[15:53:03] <Repentinus> No.
[15:53:19] <Repentinus> But you are not supposed to be constantly changing stuff on your UEFI partition.

[16:43:05] <grawity> CarloWood: for something stable, either Apache or Nginx should be fine, the default config already just serves files from /srv/http
[16:43:29] <grawity> or, Caddy is sorta popular I guess?
[16:43:38] <MacGyver> nginx default config seconded.
[16:43:42] <CarloWood> Well... I don't know if I can make it.  What I need is to show 10 photo's that kids then have to find in the forest and put in the right order (during a hike).  It would be cool I guess if you could swipe on your mobiles screen to go back and forth between the images.  But I have no idea how to do that.
[16:44:03] <SysGhost> i.e. one can easily set it up to serve ~/public/ to exampleurlorip.com/~username/

[16:50:10] <CarloWood> MacGyver: I thought about letting them join in a telegram group for the event, but that feels privacy sensitive. I can't just ask every kid to give me their phone number, and letting them join in another way - I don't know. A website seemed a better solution.
[16:50:39] <MacGyver> CarloWood: And the medium you already use to communicate with them can't be used to send the files?
[16:51:12] <MacGyver> Then I actually do like Khorne's suggestion.
[16:51:16] <CarloWood> I am not, I am communicating with one of the parents, who can communicate with the other parents.

[19:02:38] <SysGhost> jonascj: sounds like the emergency shell, which is part of the initram image. It indicates your bootloader can load the kernel and init image just fine, but your config don't find the correct root partition

[19:03:40] *** Joins: unofficial-alex (~alex@45.139.213.210)
[19:03:50] <jonascj> yes, but it is read from disk, indicating some parts of the ssd is still operational
[19:04:03] <SysGhost> when it reaches that stage, the init scripts looks for the real root partition, but it hasn't been configured properly in your bootloader and/or fstab
[19:04:05] <snek> does suspend-then-hibernate only suspend when plugged into ac?
[19:04:12] <snek> er

[19:11:01] <jonascj> SysGhost - a story as old as hard drives - drive with important data which at not backed up at all or maybe only backed up weekly or some such :P
[19:12:21] <SysGhost> Well... that can explain the behaviour. the filesystem itself is damaged to a point the kernel don't want/can't mount it on /, thus it skips over to the emergency shell.
[19:12:32] <jonascj> yes
[19:13:38] <jonascj> What puzzels me is that the disk is not readily recognized if connected to another machine (via sata, it is a sata ssd disk). That lead me to conclude the disk was completely dead, but when attached to the laptop it orginally served, it give the the grub boot loader and that emergency shell.
[19:13:59] <SysGhost> boot loaders are kinda dumb in a"smart" way. They just load the files they need no matter the state of the boot partition

[21:09:42] <MacGyver> vd: You can of course beforehand check if the file you want to turn into a swapfile is contiguous and fully allocated.
[21:10:54] <MacGyver> vd: No, because A) I don't assume I'll be using the full 64GiB when going to hibernate, and B) hibernation images are compressed, with the normal compression target being 3/5 of the original size.

[21:29:53] <rcf> vd: not btrfs, no. The reason is that unlike the more traditional filesystems, btrfs is copy-on-write, meaning that when you modify the file the new data is written elsewhere. Which is great if you want the snapshots and whatnot, but the kernel only records the location(s) of usable swap space in the file once, at swapon.

[21:44:00] <rcf> Indeed. 
[21:44:10] <vd> but you can disable CoW on a file-basis, right? chattr -C /some/swapfile I think
[21:44:13] <MrNobody_0000000> then it's just a matter of creating the swapfile
[21:44:18] *** Quits: Vonter (~Vonter@user/vonter) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[21:44:19] <MrNobody_0000000> yes
[21:44:28] <MrNobody_0000000> and you do need to run that command on the swapfile
[21:44:39] <MrNobody_0000000> but it'll screw up snapshots for the whole subvolume
[21:44:50] <MrNobody_0000000> that's why you need to create a subvolume just fo your swap
[21:45:00] <teraflops> what about the cow, did it suffer loss of the hoof?
[21:45:38] <vd> MrNobody_0000000 haaa if you have only a single file with CoW disable in a whole subvolume, the whole subvolume cannot be snapshotted anymore?
[21:45:51] <MrNobody_0000000> I think so
[21:45:56] <MrNobody_0000000> don't quote me on that
[21:46:02] <MrNobody_0000000> that's just what the guy recommended
[21:46:21] <MrNobody_0000000> btrfs filesystem doesn't let to create snapshots if there is a working swap file on the subvolume. That means that it is highly recommended to place a swap file on a separate subvolume.
[21:46:27] <MrNobody_0000000> that's what he said
[21:46:45] <vd> MrNobody_0000000 with a dedicated subvolume you can specify the CoW disabling at mount time, no file-basis tweaks I suppose (which is better, more explicit)
[21:47:01] <MrNobody_0000000> so it's more about the swapfile than the cow being disabled
[21:47:39] <MrNobody_0000000> anyway from there the procedure is quite simple
[21:48:17] <MrNobody_0000000> but yeah indeed you could disable cow for the entire subvolume at mount time
