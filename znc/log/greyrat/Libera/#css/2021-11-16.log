[00:17:56] <nbjoerg> but yeah, seems like Chrome is definitely not computing the decender at least correct

[00:28:05] <nbjoerg> well, I can only try it with Noto, but it is definitely not computing the glyph dimensions correctly
[00:30:28] <grapheti> nbjoerg: If that's the case, I'm guessing there's no fix for this (i.e., third party magic, etc) and Chrome has to fix it right?

[05:00:48] <CoderGuy> is the intended behaviour of Left:10px to move an element but not increase the size of the div it's in?
[05:01:25] <CoderGuy> and if so, what would be the proper way to tell an element "hey move over 10px but also increase the size of the div"
[05:01:53] <lantech19446> you change the width of the div and move the object over 10px
[05:02:10] <lantech19446> if you use flex or grid it can grow automatically but just a normal div will not
[05:02:24] <CoderGuy> how does it grow automatically with flex?
[05:04:09] <lantech19446> there's an option for like fit item or fit data something like that, my ide isn't cooperating
[05:04:58] <lantech19446> it might be flex-basis auto let me see if i can find it
[05:07:01] <CoderGuy> k
[05:07:26] <lantech19446> flex-basis: content;
[05:07:41] <FunkyBob> the meaning of 'left' depends on the position for that element
[05:11:12] <FunkyBob> position: relative; left: -10px;   will move an element left 10px of where it would normally show
[05:13:23] <FunkyBob> lantech19446: is it content, or auto?  or are they different again?

[11:38:31] <kakashiAL> FunkyBob: do you understand react?
[11:43:05] <FunkyBob> yes
[11:51:13] <theskillwithin> kakashiAL I usually do with react portal
[11:52:17] <kakashiAL> theskillwithin: my idea is to write a ModalProvider
[11:53:11] <kakashiAL> const App = () => (<ModalProvider><Router></MyApp></Router/></ModalProvider>)
[11:53:17] <kakashiAL> theskillwithin: know what I mean?
[11:53:36] <FunkyBob> in material-ui they do it using a portal...
[11:54:12] <FunkyBob> but as for why it's not appearing on top of everything... that's purely a css/html issue
[11:55:45] <kakashiAL> I am not a big fan of portals, because its not declarative
[12:04:58] <FunkyBob> how so?
[12:07:57] <theskillwithin> kakashiAL so your saying your going to use some sort of global context to manage instead of portal
[12:08:18] <kakashiAL> theskillwithin: that is my idea
[12:08:30] <kakashiAL> FunkyBob, theskillwithin: working on a fiddle to reproduce the problem
[12:10:17] <theskillwithin> ya that works
[12:12:12] <theskillwithin> btw for modals have a  &times; to close,  but also make sure outside click closes as well
[12:12:40] <theskillwithin> https://github.com/theskillwithin/theskillwithin-boilerplate/blob/master/src/utils/useOutsideClick.js
[12:21:47] <kakashiAL> FunkyBob: here is the fiddle, let me know if you have any questions or if you do not understand the problem:

[12:22:29] <kakashiAL> ohh wait
[12:22:41] <kakashiAL> I have to toggle the sub-menu
[12:31:29] <kakashiAL> finally!
[12:31:30] <kakashiAL> https://codesandbox.io/s/hook-usestate-styled-component-wrappers-forked-vngpr?file=/src/index.js
[12:31:41] <kakashiAL> FunkyBob: any ideas?
[12:32:28] <kakashiAL> I guess its not a CSS problem, I guess its an hierarchy problem
[12:33:50] <FunkyBob> oh, woops, was distracted
[12:34:20] <FunkyBob> i'm  not seeing the problem...
[12:34:27] <FunkyBob> the modal appears, and it's on top of everything
[12:34:34] <kakashiAL> FunkyBob: do this:
[12:35:16] <kakashiAL> if you click on "MY MODAL TOGGLE" button, everything works as expected
[12:35:22] <FunkyBob> yes
[12:35:28] <kakashiAL> but click on the "OPEN SUBMENU"
[12:35:50] <kakashiAL> and then click "OPEN MODAL TOGGLE"
[12:36:15] <kakashiAL> you will see nothing, but after you click on the "OPEN SUBMENU" you will see it
[12:36:15] <FunkyBob> something with your state is getting messed up
[12:36:20] <FunkyBob> yea
[12:36:37] <kakashiAL> and its not on top of everything
[12:37:22] <kakashiAL> now the reason why you see the modal after clicking OPEN "SUBMENU" is because the modal is now a child
[12:37:38] <kakashiAL> I do not know how to fix that
[12:39:06] <FunkyBob> i think it's less t hat it's "a child"
[12:39:09] <FunkyBob> and more what it's a child _of_
[12:40:25] <FunkyBob> first bug is that the submenu is closing when I click to open the nested modal
[12:40:37] <kakashiAL> I want that behavior
[12:41:26] <kakashiAL> let me ask it this way: if I want this behavior, I would need portals or a global-modal-provider, right?
[12:41:43] <FunkyBob> (it's also not so easy t o look at what's going on because everything's a DIV!)
[12:42:56] <kakashiAL> but the problem is clear, I mean if I want the behavior I explained, I need a Modal that lives on top of everything, that I can trigger where ever I want, even if the modal-trigger lives in a very nested environment, right?
[12:43:29] <theskillwithin> portal
[12:43:33] <FunkyBob> portal
[12:43:53] <FunkyBob> portal lets it live elsewhere in the DOM, but remain a 'child' in React contextt

[13:17:44] <FunkyBob> because they do what you need
[13:22:11] <fweht> whats exactly the reason that `height: 100%` doesn't play well with `min-height: _px` in the parent container?
[13:22:12] <fweht> https://jsfiddle.net/zybfnm4a/12/
[13:23:44] <oksushi> fweht: because height: 100%; needs a defined height on the parent
[13:24:19] <fweht> oksushi: ok, but it even works if the parent is a flex item with overflow hidden, so i assumed overflow hidden will always fix that?
[13:24:26] <oksushi> the easiest solution is to flex it https://jsfiddle.net/gz5bo4qa/
[13:24:49] <fweht> cool
[13:25:08] <oksushi> because in your example ‘100%’ would mean the entire height of the element. You actually want “the rest of the parent, minus the text bit at the top”
[13:25:09] <fweht> i just want to really understand css at some point in the future :P  so i search for patterns which dont make sense to me yet
[13:25:35] <fweht> ah no i dont care about the text i was just curious why it will ignore the parent height
[13:25:55] <oksushi> if you changed the parent to “height: 200px;” it would work just fine
[13:27:35] <fweht> my understanding was that overflow hidden creates a new block formatting context hence provides a reference for relative values
[13:31:32] <fweht> also weird that it works just setting the body to display flex: https://jsfiddle.net/zybfnm4a/33/
[13:31:33] <kakashiAL> FunkyBob: what speaks against my approach?
[13:32:19] <FunkyBob> kakashiAL: of having something higher up the chain that you, what, trigger to open the modal?
[13:32:29] <FunkyBob> what if you need another modal?
[13:33:30] <kakashiAL> yes and if I need another modal I just use the same
[13:33:58] <FunkyBob> how are you passing the content to the modal container?
[13:34:35] <kakashiAL> in the roor:  <MyModalProvider><Router><MyApp/></Router></MyModelProvider>
[13:34:45] <kakashiAL> @how do you pass content to the modal:
[13:35:40] <kakashiAL> just using components like <MyModalBoddy><Input></MyModalBody> that internaly using the ModalProvider context state
[13:37:02] <FunkyBob> really sounds like you're reinventing portals
[13:39:25] <kakashiAL> there are many react-libs that use this pattern to make everything declarative
[13:39:30] <kakashiAL> so you see what you are using
[13:39:37] <FunkyBob> how are portals not declarative?
[13:39:39] <kakashiAL> beside of that you are flexible
[13:39:41] <FunkyBob> you didn't explain before
[13:40:38] <kakashiAL> well, if I look in my root, I see what I am using (like router, error-bound etc)
[13:41:32] <FunkyBob> yes...?
[13:41:58] <FunkyBob> and when your Modal uses a portal... you still declare the Modal use  just like any other component
[13:42:04] <FunkyBob> all that changes is how it's rendered into the DOM
[13:44:02] <kakashiAL> even if you need an extra div element and ReactDOM to put your modal into it?
[13:45:09] <FunkyBob> tbh, portals are an area I've not studied in depth... but, yeah, it's like mounting another rendering point, whilst keeping the same react state/hierarchy
[13:45:09] <kakashiAL> I mean if you use my method, you just plug it in, if I use the portal way, I have to change my inital DOM, in my case, if you use next.js you do not need an index.html
[13:47:12] <FunkyBob> i've never changed my initial dom to use portals..
[13:47:21] <FunkyBob> but perhaps material-ui adds to the dom for me [it sure looks that way]
[13:47:26] <FunkyBob> i can't speak to next.js
[13:47:39] <FunkyBob> eaither way.. this is well outside the bounds of this channel's toic
[13:47:40] <FunkyBob> topic
[13:47:47] <FunkyBob> you should find a react channel to ask for BCP
[13:48:40] <kakashiAL> just wanted to know your opinion how you would manage stuff :)

[16:52:41] <no_gravity> Is there a way to remove the checkbox sign which Safari displays next to the active item in a dropdown?
[16:53:39] <stenno> can you give a simple reproduction?
[16:55:44] <no_gravity> stenno: It only happens on Mac OS X or iPadOS.
[16:55:53] <stenno> sure, i have macos
[16:56:14] <stenno> and safari
[16:56:55] <no_gravity> stenno: https://jsfiddle.net/9bsdh6xv/
[16:57:10] <no_gravity> When you click on "Hello", there is a checkmark next to "Hello" in the dropdown.
[16:57:17] <stenno> i see
[16:57:19] <stenno> yep
[16:57:55] <no_gravity> Which is pretty annoying when the option itself contains a checkmark.
[16:58:28] <stenno> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11179904/remove-checkmark-in-webkit-select

[16:58:53] <no_gravity> That's the reason nobody uses native browser elements.
[16:59:08] <stenno> also probably nobody uses safari :OP
[16:59:08] <no_gravity> Now you have to build some div soup just to get a plain dropdown.
[16:59:10] <stenno> -O
[16:59:26] <no_gravity> Yeah because nobody has an iPhone or an iPad.
[17:00:06] <stenno> well nobody with a laptop uses it

[17:39:55] <fweht> i see, thanks stenno !
[17:40:14] <stenno> like your 'aspect-ratio' rule has a high specificity, and your fallback rule matches the same elements but has a lower specificity
[17:40:53] <fweht> yeah, i think i figured something out already :)

[17:53:15] <ccapndave> Hi everyone
[17:54:07] <ccapndave> I have an image which is wider than the page (I have it at left: -25% and width: 150%).  This is causing the page to be horizontally scrollable on iOS (not any other platform).
[17:54:38] <fweht> how do you want the image to behave?  should it scale to the view width or be cut off?
[17:54:44] <ccapndave> Setting `overflow-x: hidden` on any container causes the vertical overflow to be hidden, and I need it to be visible for the design.
[17:55:03] <fweht> setting image max-width to 100vw?
[17:55:13] <ccapndave> Good thinking
[17:55:14] <ccapndave> Let me try
[17:55:35] <ccapndave> That stops the scrolling, but resizes the image
[17:56:10] <ccapndave> The image itself is actually too big, so I do `left: -25%; width: 150%;` in order to sort of zoom in on it
[17:56:23] <ccapndave> `max-width: 100vw` zooms back out
[17:57:12] *** Joins: Rockwood (~Rocky@user/rocky)
[17:57:31] <ccapndave> Maybe it would work with a `scale` in the transform
[17:57:44] <fweht> yeah, it resizes the image, but how do you want the image to behave exactly if not resizing it?
[17:58:04] <ccapndave> I want it to scale with the window
[17:58:15] <ccapndave> But always being centered and zoomed
[17:58:16] <fweht> ah!
[17:58:38] <ccapndave> And because the image file itself is too big, some of it is going to be off the page
[17:58:43] <ccapndave> But I don't want any scrolling
[17:58:54] <fweht> what if you do `left: -25vw; width: 150vw;`?
[17:58:59] <fweht> plus overflow hidden?
[17:59:22] <ccapndave> So, the further complication is that the element actually has to slightly flow vertically out of the bottom of the container
[17:59:34] <ccapndave> It has `translate: translateY(17%)`
[17:59:40] <ccapndave> So any kind of `overflow: hidden` breaks this
[17:59:49] <fweht> and just overflow-x hidden?
[18:00:01] <ccapndave> It also hides it vertically for some reason
[18:00:06] <fweht> hmmm
[18:00:10] <ccapndave> Let me try with `width: 150vw` just in case

[18:33:41] <fweht> im my experience though vertically centering a symbol to align with text will always need some adjustment if it should look really good
[18:33:59] <nbjoerg> I'd use :before for that

[19:27:55] <stenno> give your menu-item a background-color of white
[19:31:09] <stenno> also z-index is always relative to the parents' z-index
[19:31:26] <stenno> so you can't expect something to be on top on something else just because it has a higher z-index
