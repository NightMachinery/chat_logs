[01:08:11] <bpalmer> there's a big difference in letting a separate process (not dealing with elisp) handle the network.
[01:08:35] <dzho> lemacs_zzz: that's the name used to install emacs from the OS repository without the X-requiring components, rather than being a way to invoke it.

[01:22:19] <bpalmer> lemacs_zzz: tramp is more aware of what's going on, so for example if you're accessing a file over tramp ssh, it uses the remote machine's git binary to do the work instead of the local one (it has to , as tramp is the only thing that recognizes a tramp filename -- random tools would just complain the file isn't found, if run localyl)

[02:52:22] <twb> tyson2: GNU, or "some rando"
[02:52:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Personally I prefer Elpa, but that's largely because I feel it has a better approach to stability and security. For things outside of Elpa and my distro packages, I end to use use-package and manually manage submodules in some directory.

[04:33:05] <Diablo-D3> Iosevka, you fucking peasants.
[04:33:32] <homerj> it does exist in Alien:Isolation, but I don't know how to extract data from Unreal Engine games
[04:33:56] <Catie> Diablo-D3: Sure, if you've got a spare gigabyte of disk space to install it into
[04:34:16] <Diablo-D3> its not that big, jesus.
[04:34:33] <Diablo-D3> and you can get the split ttf version just to install the variants you want
[04:34:41] <Catie> Diablo-D3: Yeah, it's not the font itself. The BSD package doesn't break it out by style, so it's all or nothing
[04:34:49] <twb> I would recommend Noto more openly if it has sensible name attributes
[04:35:00] <twb> Right now it's 800MB but each language has separate font name
[04:35:33] <twb> So your font list filles up with like "Noto French, Noto French Sans, Noto French Mono, Noto French Mono Dingbats, Noto French Serif Regular SemiBold
[04:35:48] <Diablo-D3> Catie: just grab it off the github
[04:35:49] <dre> yul
[04:35:51] <dre> yuk
[04:35:52] <Diablo-D3> or build it yourself
[04:35:52] <twb> And you're like "FFS just have them all appear as merged 'Noto Serif, Noto Sans, Noto Mono, THE END"
[04:36:17] <dre> sometimes I sorta think I should give up the comic mono lifestyle

[04:36:34] <Diablo-D3> you're lucky its even in bsd ports
[04:36:41] <Diablo-D3> iosevka is never in a package manager I want :(
[04:36:45] <twb> There are better comic sans's than comic sans

[04:39:49] <homerj> because I have a couple different usernames
[04:40:29] <Catie> Diablo-D3: Sorry, it doesn't have it in the default package manager. There's an AUR build for it, but at least in my experience it doesn't build
[04:40:35] <Catie> homerj: Okay yeah solid
[04:41:49] <Diablo-D3> Ive built it before
[04:41:50] <Diablo-D3> its a pita

[04:56:15] <twb>  1. Of a strong and cruel nature; eager and unsparing; grim; fierce; ruthless; savage.
[04:56:15] <davve> or am i misunderstanding
[04:56:24] <grym> davve: oh, translating backwards and trying to get the sense of the swedish word grym in english

[11:26:44] <pimeys[m]> there is a matrix bridge for teams, so if you bridge it to matrix you can use the emacs matrix client

[11:33:33] <pimeys[m]> yeah, YMMV though, I use matrix to bridge IRC, Telegram and Signal, and Conduit is the server that doesn't need an expensive VPS for a small home usage

[16:18:50] <bremner> bpalmer: it's a bit fragile, because the parent remaps, and the child remaps the remap

[17:04:46] <phf-1> Haha... great, thanks. So, here is the thing: I've this code: https://paste.debian.net/1229301 and that example: https://paste.debian.net/1229303/
[17:05:16] <thuna`> lemacs: I think the only way to not conflict is by binding the arrow keys themselves
[17:05:45] <phf-1> If you execute the (let () ...) in one case, it works as expected and does not in the other.
[17:06:11] <bpalmer> lemacs: ah. It all exists in an uneasy ecosystem. The keys that are definitely available toyou are C-c <letter> and F6-F9 (by convention, those are reserved to the user)
[17:06:35] <bpalmer> everything else, you may have to fight for your bindings.
[17:06:38] <thuna`> bpalmer: C-c is also for major modes, no?
[17:07:16] <bpalmer> thuna`: C-c C-<letter> is for major modes.

[17:09:56] <bpalmer> phf-1: you can also save a copy of the match-data yourself to work with.

[17:10:32] <bpalmer> phf-1: you should basically always make a copy right after you match against something, because it is so fragile.
[17:11:08] <bpalmer> As an added note: you should always check the return value of re-search-forward with NOERROR , because if it didn't match, then match-data *won't* be clobbered, and you'll be affecting some random part of the buffer
[17:11:12] <bpalmer> (wherever the last match was)
[17:11:26] <phf-1> bpalmer, Ok, thank you!

[18:51:09] <sinic> My Grammaticus package sometimes has to insert Unicode words into a buffer. Some users prefer those to be normalized to NFC (i.e., with composed characters), others to NFD (i.e., with decomposed characters).
[18:51:09] <sinic> Does anyone know of an Emacs-wide setting for that? Introducing an option to every single packages seems to be the wrong approach to me.

[18:59:45] <sinic> grammaticus-mode should do exactly that, if I understand you correctly.
[18:59:46] <dpk> extra points if it only does that with "real" words i.e. ones not in a font-lock face indicating it's actually part of markup on the document for example
[19:00:02] <dpk> but you have to explicitly invoke it, no?
[19:00:42] <sinic> You have to activate the mode once per buffer, yes.
[19:00:49] <dpk> oh, i see
[19:00:53] <dpk> nifty
[19:01:05] <dpk> (so yes, it does already do exactly what i was trying to suggest, d'oh)
