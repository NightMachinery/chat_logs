[00:06:08] <Casper> DoctorD90, I have FINGER/PING/TIME/VERSION set. :p
[00:06:31] <DoctorD90> finger too??
[00:06:52] <Casper> Yes, finger, not fingerprint.
[00:07:06] <DoctorD90> well, but finger is not set by default :P
[00:07:19] <DoctorD90> so if someone would use it, not security problem will come
[00:07:25] <Casper> I know, but that's what I at least set in my znc. :p
[00:07:36] <DoctorD90> and about time.....well....people will be aware that Im probably sleeping :P
[00:07:42] <DoctorD90> the problem is VERSION
[00:08:03] <DoctorD90> yeah yeah :D but I saw on the page and I though it was setuped by default 
[00:08:08] <Casper> Problem why?
[00:08:36] <DoctorD90> well...one of the first step in an attack is to gather the version of software to check bug in that precise version
[00:08:46] <MetaNova> I personally like how ZNC intercepts and amends the CTCP VERSION response, since I like "advertising" that I'm on the development branch
[00:09:00] <DoctorD90> from my memory (I should check) in ZNC there is the number of version running
[00:09:11] <Casper> I just advertise lunar in my version :p
[00:09:25] <DoctorD90> MetaNova, ok but the number precise is a bit too much :P
[00:09:40] <DoctorD90> yes Casper :D sorry! I m always talking about the defaults

[00:13:12] <DoctorD90> is possible to configure CTCP replies via irc message?
[00:13:22] <Khaytsus> Yes, it's right in the webadmin
[00:13:57] <Khaytsus> But as for via irc client...  Would have to look in guide
[00:14:17] <DoctorD90> maybe I findout something in *controlpanel
[00:14:20] <Casper> Probably through *controlpanel
[00:14:32] <DoctorD90> <*controlpanel> AddCTCP <username> <ctcp> [reply]: Configure a new CTCP reply
[00:14:34] <Khaytsus> Yes
[00:14:38] <Khaytsus> https://wiki.znc.in/Configuration
[00:14:47] <Khaytsus> Much easier through the webadmin though
[00:14:52] <Casper> Yep. :P
[00:15:19] <DoctorD90> yeah....but I like to run a single command than explain multile step (moron proof style) XD
[00:15:26] <DoctorD90> 'run this command' - done
[00:15:35] <Khaytsus> Run this long command with a big list of replies.  
[00:15:39] <Casper> Then they run it on IRC instead of on ZNC. 
[00:15:42] <Khaytsus> But I suppose someone could just copy and paste it
[00:15:43] <Casper> It's never moron proof.
[00:15:53] <Khaytsus> Certainly not, there are _alwyas_ bigger morons
[00:17:01] <DoctorD90> Casper xD check the page xD I hardened even against moron xD

[00:17:20] <Casper> You can never harden against everyone. Believe me.
[00:17:39] <DoctorD90> yeah yeah xD even: if you write a guide for moron, only moron will use it
[00:17:44] <MetaNova> I only harden for one person
[00:17:51] <MetaNova> because I'm in a committed relationship

[01:10:09] <Casper> DarthGandalf, looking at your comment, you want to keep the DELPORT option through IRC intact?
[01:16:32] <DarthGandalf> dunno
[01:16:47] <DarthGandalf> it's a valid use case
[01:17:02] <DarthGandalf> ideally, there should some way to edit port without del+add
[01:18:00] <Casper> Well, yes, editport would be ideal.
[01:18:24] <DoctorD90> sorry, cause I didnt digged in webadmin, but from what I saw, it was only for the IRC command.
[01:18:53] <DoctorD90> I tried to del ALL ports and save the config. It did. I also restarted, and it did it. Then it was listening on no port
[01:20:20] <DoctorD90> if the delport is not used by webadmin, but only from irc, instead to request to add a new feature, at least for the moment, I would add the check and put "edit port" in todo list. Even because even with "editport", if people will remove all ports, it will continue to allow it
[01:20:54] <DoctorD90> I would prefer something that prevents me to big issue, than add a different port, delete the previous and add again with/without ssl
[01:22:23] <DoctorD90> thats my point of view :) the edit port is a plus (shortcut for add-delete-add-delete), but the bug would remain even with edit port

[01:46:58] <Casper> (I don't know C++, I do know Google and copypasta. Can be a dangerous combination)
[01:53:24] <DoctorD90> uhm...sorry :P Another little "bug": if znc is compiled without SSL support, and I try to add a port via irc commands I can add +7777, and it saves as ssl...but then it is not ssl (as it is correct)...with SSL = False, in the *status should be added a check for the SSL port addition
[01:54:25] <DoctorD90> in webadmin it correctly handles the not ssl support
[01:55:54] <DoctorD90> additional info: the ssl added port, via web is correctly shown as not ssl. Via irc command it still reamains shown as ssl
[01:57:25] <Casper> Well, make an issue, heh. :p
[01:57:59] <Casper> Or use IRCNetwork.cpp L1347~1356 as base to add it yourself. :D
[01:59:04] <DoctorD90> let me check if I can help...
[02:02:05] <DoctorD90> thanks Casper maybe I can :) I will end test on adding ssl server and I will do it
[02:04:21] <DoctorD90> did I run it wrongly? addserver $me $network irc.libera.chat:+6697 ????? it saves as hosthanem the port too :/
[02:08:10] <Casper> DoctorD90: addserver $me $network irc.libera.chat +6697
[02:08:23] <Casper> You have to split hostname and port, can't combine them with :
[02:09:05] <DoctorD90> ah well....another thing to add to command client :P it doesnt report the port (at least in the version im using....let me check on git version)
[02:09:38] <Casper> Also, https://i.cspr.cc/51c74ab30c.png I think this could be added around line 1691 on ClientCommand.cpp to kinda sorta catch the non-SSL port adding. But as I don't intend to compile with SSL, I have no need to test this at the moment. :P 
[02:10:24] <Casper> As I don't inted to compile -without- SSL*.
[02:11:15] <DoctorD90> Casper, have you already did it? XD you are a dragon xD ahahah may you send me the file or tell me the line at which add it?
[02:11:20] <DoctorD90> I will test it :)

[21:20:50] <bynarie> irrelevant question but super curious... whatever port ZNC is running it, it serves 2 things on 1 port.. say im using port 4000.. if i connect to https://znc.server:4000 i get a website that contains the webmin interface.. but i also use the same host:port to connect to irc.. how is it possible that 1 port can serve 2 applications like that?
[21:23:12] <bynarie> or is it some kind of re-route system that sees the connection data and says "Ok, this is a webbrowser, we will redirect you to X port,, or "Hey, this is an irc client, redirect to port Y

[23:53:43] <bookworm> bynarie: simply a matter of the two protocols not looking similar, meaning if you get a header that starts with a http header you route that to the http handler. That only works if the application is aware of it though
