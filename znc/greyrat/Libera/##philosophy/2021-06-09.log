[17:35:20] <lalia> We've got to find our grinder before we can make coffee... so it seems like a tea day.
[17:35:41] <lalia> Y'all doing well today?

[17:36:16] <ThePhilosopher> I am doing alright. Doing a bit of research.
[17:36:50] <ThePhilosopher> I could never really get into the concentrates all that much. They are good for me as a once in awhile thing, but I prefer flowers.

[18:47:36] <pussipupu> Lots of smart thoughtful  people accept it, but I've never been able to see why
[18:48:00] <nihilus> because the alternative is unpleasant
[18:48:22] <pussipupu> That's not a good reason to believe things though, and also I don't accept the claim
[18:48:47] <pussipupu> We don't need to accept moral realism to engage in moral reasoning and live good lives

[18:49:37] <audrey> I never could understand either, pussipupu. Especially in relation to something like hard determinism, one of the most major objections to hard determinism is that it would challenge our moral intuitions about responsibility

[18:52:51] <audrey> Perhaps someone could articulate the defense more convincingly than I can. To me, most arguments in favor moral realism of have to do with human moral intuitions (which I think are quite fallible for a number of reasons).
[18:53:01] <nihilus> so many contemporary views fall back on an intuition argument...
[18:53:17] <alarix> What is the most commonly accepted argument against the Is-Ought Argument?
[18:53:50] <nihilus> is ought isn't an argument so much as a fallacy
[18:54:05] <audrey> You have things like Kantian ethics, which tries to expunge intuition or feeling and frame morality merely in terms of (quasi?)logical imperatives
[18:54:07] <badsektor> morality is simple, it is about respecting other people's boundaries
[18:54:28] <audrey> But I wonder whether that, too, rests on some kind of human intuition.
[18:54:38] <audrey> I don´t see anything imperative about the categorical imperative, honestly. :P
[18:54:42] <nihilus> right
[18:55:15] <nihilus> I haven't seen an ethical system that doesn't just fall back on agreed upon intuitions
[18:55:22] <nihilus> in the end, even if it pretends otherwise...
[18:55:25] <alarix> pussipupu: I don't suppose there are any.
[18:56:08] <pussipupu> It's interesting that so many people are moral realists, but maybe it's an intuitive position defended by logic, rather than a position arrived at by logic
[18:56:14] <badsektor> morality is about an unsigned agreement among people
[18:56:31] <audrey> Well I didn´t sign it, so it´s not valid! :D
[18:56:56] <pussipupu> I'd tend to frame morality as a form of discourse and reasoning, but ultimately grounding on intersubjective preference

[18:58:22] <alarix> badsektor: I don't think it is.
[18:58:37] <pussipupu> I listened to a podcast recently with someone arguing that aesthetic goodness is also objective, but similarly couldn't figure out what their actual justification for the position was
[18:59:09] <nihilus> well plato of course takes this position

[19:03:44] <nihilus> it reminds me of that scene in monty python when arthur argues with the peasant about the fact that he's king
[19:03:49] <inhahe> There are perfectly good reasons to be moral, but those reasons are rooted in life itself, which isn't something that lends to analysis and rationalization. It's only because of the rationalism of our times that the debate over whether morality is objective, real, determined, subjective, relative, etc. is so popular.
[19:03:51] <badsektor> moral contract is unsigned, it is assumed

[20:02:22] <audrey> 21st century critical race theory is essentially reframing the bouregoise-proletariat (exploiter/exploited) distinction in terms of race instead of class, but keeping the same oppressor-oppressed narrative structure.

[20:39:24] <pussipupu> Yeah, microscopy in and of itself isn't hugely on topic
[20:39:36] <pussipupu> As in better suited to ##philosophy-off
[20:39:39] <Parf> i see
[20:40:06] <biys> what do you guys think of the idea that jesus was only sent for the jews.
[20:40:36] <pussipupu> I'm not of a relevant faith or a theologian, so I think literally nothing of it
[20:40:52] <biys> fine
[20:41:14] <[itchyjunk]> Not sure jesus existed
[20:41:22] <nihilus> ##religion is a place, nobody talks
[20:41:25] <Parf> really, what i bring the microscopes up for is to suggest that we might be entering a new renaissance of science, where no longer is the technology 20 years down the line, and a sort of breach has been made into the future, which suggests that there might be new philosophy lurking behind the perspectives thus afforded to us
[20:41:57] <nihilus> that's pretty much what the enlightenment is
[20:41:58] <nihilus> lul

[20:42:10] <Parf> well, in any case, it's going down currently
[20:42:20] <biys> Parf: i am sure our advancements, though not insignificant, will be fewer and further between
[20:42:30] <Parf> biys, i disagree
[20:42:37] <biys> we'll see.
[20:42:38] <Parf> oh you mean in philosophy?
[20:42:47] <biys> i mean intellectual advancement
[20:42:55] <biys> we're in an intellectual dark age imo
[20:43:12] <Parf> oh please, they're cracking this stuff right now
[20:43:17] <Parf> you're looking in the wrong place, then
[20:43:44] <biys> this topic, as you're discussing it, is old.
[20:43:55] <biys> like...  6-8 months or so.
[20:44:05] <Parf> what is?
[20:44:12] <biys> there is lots of conversation about it right now.

[20:44:47] <Parf> lots of conversation about what biys
[20:44:51] <blkshp> <test failure>
[20:45:26] <Parf> intellectual dark ages? meanwhile we're making vast strides in AI and quantum physics
[20:45:28] <Trashlord> thanks
[20:45:36] <biys> the idea of an intellectual dark age being upon us and that advancement, though not insignificant, will be fewer and further between.
[20:45:41] <Trashlord> I got a message from ChanServ that I have to be identified to speak, so for a sec I thought I wasn't identified
[20:46:08] <nihilus> biys: where does one find this conversation? who is having it?
[20:46:09] <Parf> i'd say a practical third improvement to an otherwise currently useless tool that could perhaps bring bio-labs to the fore in low wealth countries is a significant shift
[20:46:45] <nihilus> Trashlord: it just does that regardless of whether you are identified.
[20:47:08] <audrey> nihilus: ##religion is an occasionally active channel
[20:47:19] <nihilus> I've been sitting in it for about a week
[20:47:26] <Parf> if that were the only thing, i would agree, but there is a massive load of these breakthroughs. they just achieved three qubit systems in silicon, the stuff is going down. people don't seem to be prepared, numbed by their cynicism
[20:48:01] <Trashlord> nihilus: yes, I figured that now
[20:48:01] <nihilus> Parf: prepared for what? how do you prepare for the unpredictable?
[20:48:06] <Parf> it's not unpredictable
[20:48:13] <Parf> i'm currently predicting an enormous paradigm shift
[20:48:24] <nihilus> yeah but everyone's done that in every generation
[20:48:31] <nihilus> it's not as original as you might think
[20:48:37] <Parf> who cares about originality
[20:48:47] <nihilus> well it means that feeling this way isn't special to now
[20:48:56] <biys> even a broken watch is right two times a day.
[20:49:05] <Parf> then you agree that i am right
[20:49:13] <biys> we will see.
[20:49:42] <Parf> you guys disgust me, keep those heads in the sand
[20:49:45] <biys> get back at me in 3 years and we'll see where we are.
[20:49:48] <biys> 3 to 5 years.
[20:49:55] <Parf> it isn't taking 3 years
[20:50:09] <Parf> tomorrow there'll be another breakthrough, these are weekly breakthroughs we're experiencing
[20:50:33] <nihilus> to be excited about radical change is not to understand the nature of it

[22:41:42] <lucky> on which I tend to lean towards your view.  I'd describe it as a sense of unease at my emotional response being very out of whack with what my intellect tells me I might warrant feeling in response

[22:43:39] <Parf> and the technological, sorry i've lost the plot myself from being so demoralized
[22:43:43] <lucky> maybe it always was? I never came up with a good way to think about, well, change over history, or history.
[22:44:41] <Parf> in the end, my opinion is that the general public should be entertained, educated, and enlightened, promptly

[22:46:04] <Parf> i don't claim to have any true specificity of understanding, but i'm quite familiar with patterns, and we've JUST passed a sort of crest

[22:47:50] <Parf> yeah, this is an "exciting time" if nothing else
[22:47:52] <lucky> about a century?
[22:48:02] <Parf> we're secured, i think
[22:48:21] <Parf> i think our energy problems are phantoms of the past, food, biology, brain mechanisms,
[22:48:36] <pussipupu> I don't know what you're trying to express, so I guess I'll duck out
[22:48:43] <lucky> I'm a little lost too at this point heh
[22:48:55] <Parf> okay, alpha fold, for example,
[22:49:08] <Parf> which lead into further discoveries, the whole rna vaccine technology,
[22:49:24] <lucky> I think it's the daily The Singularity is Nigh, Repent! sermon, not from me for once :P
[22:49:26] <Parf> energy wise, they're creating ever smaller and lighter batteries
[22:49:47] <Parf> hell there's even a graphene circuit, which just uses brownian motion to produce electricity
[22:50:11] <Parf> https://phys.org/news/2020-10-physicists-circuit-limitless-power-graphene.html pretty cool
[22:50:12] <ro-bot-o> [url] Physicists build circuit that generates clean, limitless power from graphene | phys.org
[22:50:35] <lucky> Well, counterpoint to unbounded optimism
[22:50:53] <Parf> you will live to see horrors beyond your comprehension
[22:50:59] <lucky> We've had the basic technologies and sketches for social organization, to guarantee nearly every human being is fed, has clothing, basic vaccinations, etc.
[22:51:00] <Parf> it's happening, my friend
[22:51:06] <lucky> And we have since about 1900.
[22:51:34] <lucky> Political problems don't get solved by new technologies, they just create even bigger new problems :P
[22:52:22] <lucky> this general argumnet
[22:52:32] <Parf> exactly, but the old problems become quaint by comparison, at least!
[22:52:49] <Parf> soon we'll be shuttling about the universe, fighting the borg
[22:53:05] <Parf> and ourselves
[22:53:13] <lucky> this general argument could also have been made in 1960 - we have split the atom, decoded the information-based structure of life itself, ascended into the heavens and apotheosis is nigh
[22:53:18] <lucky> and in 1910 and in 1860
[22:53:32] <Parf> yes, you're right, and those were obviously quite significant shifts
[22:54:00] <lucky> (then again, maybe they were in fact, all correct, as were you, and we're just all on the same damn exponential curve but can't quite guess when it shoots off the chart
[22:54:50] <Parf> just don't have enough sci-fi that matches "the plot" these days

[22:55:58] <voltage_> im having a deja vu again
[22:58:17] <Parf> lucky, my argument against "repent the singularity is nigh", it's more along the lines of "converge! the singularity is nigh!". we're going to become something else, or something else is going to come of us, it's seeming increasingly close, so we might need to be prepared with some stable philosophies to this end, and you're right to look to our past
[22:58:36] <lucky> Parf: I'm sorry, I was being very tongue in cheek on that one :) didn't mean to be dismissive
[22:59:00] <Parf> no i didn't think you were!
[22:59:43] <lucky> uh, yes, very probably, and I don't even know when it's going to happen (if I'm honest I'm still technically agnostic on whether it's possible)
[22:59:58] <Parf> i've heard that sentiment
[23:00:02] <lucky> the Oracle will be equivalent to technological aliens showing up
[23:00:11] <Parf> but i do believe their best theories are contingent on old maths, old statistics
[23:00:27] <lucky> end of history.  next chapter.  whatever.  no wrapping one's head around it though.
[23:00:38] <Parf> maybe
[23:00:43] <Parf> i've seen around a few corners
[23:01:18] <lucky> Tho another take might be that this has already happened, and is happening right now, and will continue to.  Though perhaps at an increasing rate on the general trend
[23:03:00] <Parf> it's sort of a middle distance fidelity, but there is a world that is coming into vision. where the awareness is truly decentralized, we start to thin out ourselves from our flesh, finally, pervasively. not on a trippy woo scale, but a genuine rigorous scale. it'll look a bit like an HUD you look at with your eyes closed after you've closed your eyes again with your eyes closed
[23:03:07] <lucky> I've never been hungry.  I've been seriously sick once, but they started my heart back up when I died, and otherwise a few sniffles.  I speak to people on every continent and I've never grown or gathered anything to eat other than as a rather esoteric hobby.
[23:03:35] <Parf> do you like fish things?
[23:03:36] <lucky> My great-great-grandfather would probably have been able to have a conversation with me if he popped up in my room today after he got over the shock, but gosh it'd be a big gap
[23:04:20] <Parf> maybe people don't want to know about the future
[23:05:31] <lucky> I am not a marine biologist no ;)
[23:05:44] <Parf> i think i'm going to move to china
[23:05:54] <Parf> i hear the language isn't too hard to figure out
[23:06:03] <lucky> out of the frying pan and into the fire
[23:06:15] <Parf> like prometheus!
[23:06:37] <Parf> or was that icarus
[23:07:17] <nalkri> Prometheus stole fire, and allegedly humour, from the gods to deliver to mankind
[23:07:23] <lucky> Prometheus stole fire
[23:07:25] <lucky> yeah
[23:07:28] <nalkri> Icarus flew too close to the sunn on waxen wings
[23:07:42] <Parf> i know, i was just trying to match the idiom with the myth
[23:07:49] <blkshp> Should've used loctite.
[23:07:52] <lucky> Icarus built a set of wax wings to lift his father.. I give up I can't type as fast as nalkri :
[23:08:16] <Parf> dedalus
[23:08:16] <nalkri> It's because I'm using emacs, gives a +2 buff to typing skills
[23:08:23] <Parf> who built the labyrinth
[23:08:47] <nalkri> Daedalus built the labyrinth and succeded in the escape flight
[23:09:20] <Parf> just gotta sacrifice your kid to curiosity a few times, that's what kids are for!
[23:09:43] <nalkri> That doesn't seem to be a message of the legend, but sure :þ
[23:09:56] <nalkri> blkshp: loctite superglue or loctite loctite?
[23:10:09] <nalkri> I mostly just use nylocs
[23:10:35] <blkshp> apoxy
[23:10:44] <nalkri> epoxy!
[23:10:51] <nalkri> or apoplexy

[23:11:26] <evolv> "You see this goblet? For me this glass is already broken. I enjoy it: I drink out of it. It holds my water admirably, sometimes even reflecting the sun in beautiful patterns. If I should tap it, it has a lovely ring to it. But when I put this glass on the shelf and the wind knocks it over or my elbow brushes it off the table and it falls to the ground and shatters, I say, 'Of course.' When I understand that the glass is already broken, every moment with

[23:12:26] <audrey> ugh
[23:12:37] <audrey> evolv: Echoes of the Nietzschean affirmation, eh
[23:12:45] <blkshp> Tell Dylan Hunt.
[23:12:51] <evolv> audrey, Ajahn Chah
[23:12:57] <lucky> Parf: as to Chinese... it gets a mythical reputation and a bunch of exoticized treatment.  It's not in some whole other category.  But it's also totally unrelated, has an enormous self-contained semantic world (second largest outside of the Western European cultural one with hundreds of thousands of words in use -- almost none of them related to any word in English) ... and it's written in a
[23:12:59] <lucky> rather ... interesting way.
[23:13:01] <evolv> audrey, Nietzsche was influenced by Buddhism, though
[23:13:05] <lucky> Probably one of the hardest languages for an English speaker
[23:13:10] <audrey> Tangentially, yes, evolv.
[23:13:23] <audrey> Also influenced by Schopenhauer, who was by and large *not* exposed to Eastern thought until well established in his writings.
[23:13:26] <evolv> yeah, in a small part
[23:13:35] <evolv> Schopenhauer was more influenced by Advaita Vedanta
[23:13:42] <Parf> i do notice that the word and the drawing and placement of each symbol is not separate, lucky
[23:13:44] <audrey> (Though Nietzsche would probably not like admitting he was influenced by Schopenhauer.)
[23:14:01] <audrey> I mean, I think the Nietzschean affirmation is mauvaise foi, but to each his own, I guess.
[23:14:06] <audrey> (To use a Sartreanism.)
[23:14:09] <evolv> Upanisahds had a much greater impact of Western philosophers
[23:14:12] <evolv> on*
[23:14:16] <evolv> and scientists, too
[23:14:39] <evolv> Upanishads* blah
[23:16:43] <voltage_> "In the philosophy of existentialism, bad faith is the psychological phenomenon whereby men and women act inauthentically, by yielding to the external pressures of society to adopt false values and disown their innate freedom as sentient human beings."
[23:16:48] <voltage_> what freedom?
[23:17:30] <lucky> Parf: I got fixated on it too.  Don't blame me though, the Chinese over-estimate how much "inherent meaning" there is in their characters.  There is very little to none.  At its core it's a phonetic system, actually.  It's kind of like if you wrote "meet" as "mit 😀" and meat as "mit 🍔" and "mead" as "mit 🐝" and knead as "mit 🍞" -- basic mark of pronunciation, then a classifier to
[23:17:32] <lucky> narrow the semantic meaning so you know which precise word meant
[23:18:32] <lucky> turns out when you stick a Mandarin speaker in a brain scanner their auditory cortex lights up just like in people who read alphabetic languages
[23:18:48] <lucky> so, no special meaning in the characters, just representations of spoken words.  boo.  :(
[23:19:09] <Parf> maybe we just need more precise scanning to see the difference
[23:19:19] <Parf> we're still only just mapping that poor thing

[23:21:43] <lucky> I've been brushing up on my Klingon too, just in case.
[23:22:10] <audrey> LOL!
[23:22:18] <Parf> no, the one that can intimate memories and things directly, like when we're dreaming, keywoards become neural progressions to disambiguate meaning
[23:22:31] <audrey> I don´t think there will ever be such a thing as a universal human language.
[23:22:33] <audrey> Too political.
[23:22:41] <Parf> what if it's compulsive
[23:22:50] <audrey> Compulsive? In what way?
[23:22:59] <Parf> so "innate" and pulling on all the right bells and whistles you can't help but "learn it"
[23:23:36] <Parf> so useful
[23:23:38] <audrey> A lot of underlying assumptions about human psychology and grammar there, eh?
[23:23:55] <Parf> yes, but none of them totally without merit, we do seem to resemble one another, don't we
[23:23:56] <lucky> A little less far out than that, there is the latent space of machine learning-based systems
[23:24:20] <audrey> People have been coming up with universal language attempts since Solresol ...
[23:24:26] <lucky> It... seems conceptually possible to abstract a mathematical representation of ... something, I'm not sure what I'd call it.  language?  para-language?  simply by comparing different languages saying the same thing in different ways
[23:24:30] <Parf> and thinking is thinking, across whichever divide you'd like to render it. it exists. context itself is that language, i think, but i can't bottle that
[23:24:44] *** Quits: nalkri (~user@user/nalkri) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[23:25:18] <Parf> the multi-modal ai are achieving some transcendental things, i'm not sure which one you're directly referring to but i'm curious
[23:25:35] <audrey> Are we talking about the neural correlates of human language use?
[23:25:38] <lucky> in a very fuzzy, inadequate, way.  I'm not even sure such systems are *theoretically* equivalent given no time or space limits, to what's in our heads
[23:26:02] <lucky> audrey: me?  No, abstract data structure that maps to every human language.  Almost Chomskyian idea
[23:26:12] <lucky> and I'm not sure it's truly possible, tho a practical subset may be
[23:26:22] <audrey> Talking to both you and Parf, I suppose.
[23:26:41] <lucky> of course maybe that thing would be what Parf is talking about, just encoded... however it is biologically in our heads
[23:27:15] <Parf> and designing something functionally equivalent to that on every scale from the ground up might be a pertinent act once we've come to grips with those machinations of our language
[23:27:51] <lucky> We can't even give up base ten numbering. :)
[23:27:59] <Parf> eventually, hopefully, there'll be nothing to talk about
[23:28:07] <Parf> singularity, and all that
[23:28:17] <audrey> Base ten numbering seems largely an accident of human physiology.
[23:28:21] <audrey> Ten fingers, ten numbers.
[23:28:24] <lucky> Yup.
[23:28:30] <audrey> Mathematically base twelve is far more convenient.
[23:28:34] <Parf> i think some of s have our favorite numbers
[23:28:34] <lucky> It's not universal at all, either.  8 and 12 are very common too
[23:28:35] <Parf> i like 20
[23:28:36] <audrey> Divisible by 2, 3, 4, 6

[23:29:44] <audrey> I´m not a mathematician, fairly ignorant of technical terms alas.
[23:30:06] <Parf> the key here is to remember that there is space for the ascendancy of the current human future
[23:30:07] <lucky> it's the simplest way to represent integers, akin to binary for natural numbers
[23:30:24] <Parf> there's space for our thoughts to exist in this realm without having to fear it, so to speak
[23:30:47] <lucky> of course, no one says you have to use an integer as your base, or even a rational number
[23:31:14] <lucky> a field will do
[23:32:17] <audrey> Heh. I´m out of my depth here.
[23:32:20] * audrey bows out
[23:32:21] <Parf> what happens when science renders us incapable of deception entirely! brain scans indeed
[23:32:25] <lucky> oof, sorry
[23:32:27] <Parf> i'm constantly out of my depth
[23:32:39] <Parf> in fact, i have very dim concepts of everything i've discussed
[23:32:39] <audrey> No worries!
[23:32:44] <lucky> audrey: It's actually not a too-deep topic except math drowns itself in esoteric vocabulary :/
[23:32:46] <audrey> This is a great conversation
[23:33:00] <audrey> I´m just careful not to voice opinions about topics I´m ignorant of. :)
[23:33:10] <Parf> i'll make all the mistakes myself then!
[23:34:15] <lucky> audrey: aside from counting up in binary for the natural numbers 1, 2, 3... you can add negative digits, and then count up or down using the same position number system.  If you don't use an integer at all, you can count, discretely, in steps of complex numbers, or even just mathematical objects that obey generalized properties akin to numbers (fields) and ... that's kinda where much of late
[23:34:17] <lucky> 19th and 20th century math got kicked off, really.
[23:34:35] <lucky> and then it quickly gets out of my depth too :/
[23:35:22] <audrey> Boolean algebra/formal logics are about the limit of my mathematical ability.
[23:35:23] <Parf> it's the one station i'm not sufficiently versed in to inspire anyone with. and yet, it's all becoming so flesh and bone compared with the old dusty textbook theories,
[23:35:32] <Parf> i figure i'm safe when math turns into physics
[23:36:02] <audrey> I studied trigonometry in high school but forgot all of it soon after.
[23:36:03] <lucky> Well, to go back to the more out there ponderings of earlier Parf ...
[23:37:06] <Parf> well, probably because to have a mathematical language is to use it to describe some sort of mental phenomena or physical or another, i don't look at math as purely concept, but rather purely utility, but that's probably why it eats itself, self limiting, physics is more of an observational sport, seems
[23:37:07] <lucky> This is the thing that really scares me.  We really suck at this sortof symbolic reasoning.  Computers do not.  And some of the insights made when different areas were generalized and connected have been very startling.
[23:37:31] <lucky> and we inch ever closer to a machine that might just spit proofs out faster than we could ever read them, assuming we could even understand them
[23:37:33] <Parf> you really ought to show me what you're talking about specifically!
[23:39:11] <Parf> anyway, yes, gpt-3, wudao, it all implies a sturdy need for philosophy to guide us in our dealings with it
[23:39:14] <lucky> I can come up with a bunch of examples but they're all mediore
[23:39:42] <audrey> Wouldn´t it be funny if the answer to the Fermi paradox were simply that once a civilization attains a certain amount of technological savvy (but not enough to propagate itself across planets/solar systems), it inevitably gets destroyed by AI of its own creation.
[23:39:54] * audrey spends an unhealthy amount of time thinking about solutions to the Fermi paradox
[23:40:08] <Parf> no, it's still riding us, we're a useful tool to IT
[23:40:21] <lucky> audrey: Uh, not quite that one but I suspect something actually even more depressing/scary than that.
[23:40:21] <Parf> we can mine gems from the earth that allows it to learn at this point, it still needs us a little
[23:40:34] <econo> michio kaku has a theory of civilizations that kind of incorporates that
[23:40:36] <Parf> besides, we'll make great pets
[23:40:45] <lucky> Caveat: I am rather stoned and I didn't sleep at all last night, so I haven't quite gone off the dep end though I know this will sound it
[23:41:08] <econo> that there's a stage where the society has the power to destroy itself, and if it can't figure out how to cooperate...boom
[23:41:08] <audrey> lucky: I mean, I have a lot of depressing answers. I love them.
[23:41:20] <lucky> Math is a fundamental part of reality, but it is nonphysical, and physical systems can instantiate it and have unique properties that manifest in the physical world, driven by... whatever the rules are in the nonphysical domain there
[23:41:32] <lucky> that's where we exist, our subjective surreal being
[23:41:35] <audrey> Well, lucky, you are doing very well for someone who´s stoned. I wouldn´t have guessed.
[23:41:57] <lucky> and I suspect it's also true of information processing machines in general
[23:42:07] <lucky> they may summon something they should not
[23:42:08] <audrey> Also, why the hell is it I´m the only one who seems to live in a place where substances are hella illegal?!
[23:42:11] * audrey :sadface:
[23:42:19] <audrey> Missing out on all the fun here.
[23:42:32] <audrey> Anyway, apologies for the distraction.
[23:42:38] <audrey> I really struggle to follow mathematics talk
[23:43:00] <Parf> yes, that other world, where concept exists without the stability of foundation.
[23:43:02] <lucky> I think this is actually roughly what Russell thought, at the end of the day

[23:44:20] <evolv> you're a master at languages
[23:44:43] <lucky> So if a simple biochemical system can instantiate the engine of biological evolution in physical reality, and if a more complicated thing switched on in our heads on a larger scale and runs ever so much faster and broader and non-brute-force-search to the problem
[23:44:45] <audrey> It´s not the same kind of «language».
[23:44:57] <lucky> then ... what does the next step in info-juggling writ large and concentrated bring?
[23:45:07] <evolv> in a way, it may be a bit more ancient, audrey
[23:45:08] <Parf> the faster we learn about fivefold rotational symmetry the better, is all i'm saying
[23:45:11] <lucky> I have no idea but questions like that are why I tend not to sleep well :p
[23:45:24] <audrey> It´s a good thing to lose sleep over, lucky. :P
[23:46:16] <Parf> lucky, we don't even need the old sciences to reign as if we stood ourselves with the mightiest machines on this planet, seems
[23:46:21] <evolv> a universal language would have to co-occur with universal culture
[23:46:45] <evolv> otherwise it'll sound awkardly formal and cold
[23:47:02] <Parf> yes, as long as it has SOME clothes

[23:50:20] <audrey> I´m struggling to follow along now. :P
[23:50:47] <lucky> I realized an hour back it's best not to latch on too hard to any of these illusive things
[23:50:51] <lucky> just let them carry you off somewhere :P
[23:50:55] <Parf> okay, think of a quantum computer these days as a quantum proofing device, it makes manifest a given quantum state instead of "running the math"
[23:51:21] <audrey> Maybe I can find some airplane glue in the pantry and I´ll get back to y´all. :D
[23:51:25] <Parf> so, the more things you can analyze to the quantum state, the better, these are anchors for us in the "quantum world", you could even think of them as ships, or the navigational devices on the ships themselves
[23:52:12] <Parf> a silicon device that operates on a three qubit scale permanently saves us the trouble of "testing" or simulating it, it's like the gram scale we use to define all grams on earth
[23:53:17] <Parf> regardless, with higher fidelity, we can clean up a lot of noise, like with that microscope that gives us 34% increased microscopy capacity for all that white noise diffracted light we look at through our simple visual microscopes
[23:53:41] <Parf> it's a practical solution with quantum philosophies and physics entirely, it's the dawn of the new age
[23:53:49] <lucky> I think I see where you're at with this, but that is surely just ... computation's magic?
[23:54:11] <Parf> and if it is "computation's magic", what difference does it make if it's actively useful
[23:54:23] *** Quits: nihilus (~nihil@user/nihilus) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[23:57:05] <Parf> it'll be the same computation's magic that'll give us that universal language we were just discussing, the compulsory one you can't escape from so don't read the "alphabet" as it should be a sort of fractalized iteration of itself we can't separate from its functional capacities as symbols and will instantly integrate
[23:58:06] *** Joins: nihilus (~nihil@user/nihilus)
[23:58:18] <lucky> Well, that took longer than for audrey but I have to admit I'm lost too now :)
[23:58:57] <lucky> I guess I'm just not seeing what properties a quantum computer has that are quite that of an upheaval
[23:59:28] <lucky> but then again no one can really seem to figure out how to think about them or reason about them, much like with early classical computers it'll be a hell of a lot easier to start constructing systems for them when we actually have one...
[23:59:56] <Parf> well, it allows us to record with higher precision what we were before a little hazy on. things that weren't quite lined up become just so, it's a matter of the tiniest calculations these days, but automated calculation that outstrips our own is no laughing matter
