[02:18:04] <mpickering> michaelpj: I am not working on it actively, need a client to want cabal/hls support
[02:18:28] <mpickering> I implemented a prototype for cabal, not sure if it runs into the problem fendor says
[02:19:04] <fendor[m]> In theory it must be broken for at least some packages that use `build-type: Custom` and an older Cabal version

[12:09:19] <fendor[m]> maerwald, the prefetching doesn't work, afaict, because the test-suite deletes everything in `test-workspace` before running
[12:11:30] <fendor> can we set the cache directory to a different location?

[15:31:03] <fendor[m]> the relevant change is just not deleteing the <workspace>/bin/.ghcup/cache dir on test-run, but windows isn't happy
