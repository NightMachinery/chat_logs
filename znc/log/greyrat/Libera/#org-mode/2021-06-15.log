[12:16:52] <alice[m]> hallo! i'd like to have some general variables defined at the beginning of my document and then replaced whenever their name appears in the doc at export time (e.g. think of a client's name)
[12:17:28] <alice[m]> i found a mention of macros for a problem thatsimilar to mine
[12:17:39] <alice[m]> *that's apparently similar to mine
[12:17:41] <alice[m]> https://orgmode.org/manual/Macro-Replacement.html
[12:19:01] <alice[m]> so i define =#+MACRO: name ACME Corp= in the doc header and then call it as ={{{client}}}= where needed in the doc
[12:19:55] <alice[m]> however... this doesn't seem to work within some raw LaTeX blocks that i use in the doc
[12:21:13] <alice[m]> in other words, =\begin{center}{{{client}}}\end{center}= is replaced with =client= (instead of =ACME Corp=)
[12:21:59] <alice[m]> any idea of how to force the macro replacement to take priority over latex's interpretation?
[12:22:35] <Demosthenex> alice[m]: yes, i've had the same issue with latex interpreting macros. let me know if you figure it out ;]
[12:22:42] <Demosthenex> i think raw latex just doesn't expand them

[14:11:49] <alice[m]> i can have a section and then a numbered list below it, which would almost do it...

[14:13:51] <alice[m]> i'd like this to be handled by org-num-mode, of course, so that things are updated manually as i go

[14:16:34] <alice[m]> hm actually... i understand that org-num-mode is about visualising the document as you edit it, it's not about what gets eventually exported...
[14:17:09] <alice[m]> i'm actually interested in the PDF export over having the numbers while editing
[14:17:23] <alice[m]> so i should probably look at something at the latex level instead?
[14:17:42] <ngz> I think so.
[14:18:15] <alice[m]> ngz: interesting, i'm exploring that right now, thanks
[14:18:24] <ngz> Doing it at the Org level requires some parse tree tweaking
[14:19:12] <alice[m]> ok i see, and it might be an overkill in my case
[14:19:24] <ngz> Of course, it's not impossible, but I assume that LaTeX has something ready-made already. So if you're only interested in LaTeX output, that's the way to go.

[14:31:52] <rdrg109> It's like yeti's solution but instead of doing that Org hack whenever you want to use the macro, you now use \macro:name  because LaTeX sets its value at the beginning of the document.

[18:02:02] <zebrag> In some file I'm in overview mode, with 6 headlines/subtrees. I want to add some note at the end of the fifth subtree (I guess there is some ambiguity, but let's suppose there is not). And yes, I don't want to open the headlines: I sure don't want to see what's in them.
[18:03:25] <zebrag> I guess it's `refile`?
[18:08:55] <zebrag> That did work

[19:36:28] <rdrg109> afidegnum: Use :results raw. The problem is that once some headlines are generated, it is difficult to know which were automatically generated and which not.
[19:38:51] <rdrg109> I'm mentioning this because most of the times when someone wants to evaluate a code block, it won't probably work as intended, so you might want to reevaluaate it, but the problem is that if you use :results raw, the results won't be automatically deleted because Org Mode will think that they are headlines.
