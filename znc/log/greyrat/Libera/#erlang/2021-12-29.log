[23:07:45] <fancycade> Does anyone know to start rebar3 shell without triggering a recompile?
[23:15:10] <tristan> fancycade: it isn't possible
[23:18:15] <fancycade> ah bummer, my app no longer compiles quickly and i was hoping i could skip it just to start up the app
[23:18:44] <fancycade> releases seem the way to go forenow
[23:18:55] <rkallos> One alternative to avoid recompiling is to start erl, but pass the dirs of ebins that rebar3 maintains to erl, e.g. `erl -pa $(rebar3 path)`
[23:19:13] <tristan> oh wait, recompile?
[23:19:17] <tristan> I thought you said compile
[23:19:28] <tristan> there shouldn't be a recompile... sounds like something is wrong
[23:19:54] <tristan> but yea, you can also use `rebar3 path` like rkallos says. but definitely an issue going on if there is recompilation
[23:20:08] <fancycade> it has a native dependency and also uses the erlydtl compiler plugin
[23:20:28] <fancycade> i figured it was triggering a recompile because of one of those
[23:20:58] <tristan> could be, still an issue if they are already compiled.
[23:21:02] <tristan> but could be with the plugin
[23:21:34] <fancycade> let me play around with a test project with no deps and see if i can reproduce the issue
[23:22:07] <tristan> cool. if you can and make it public I can take a look
[23:22:58] <fancycade> https://git.sr.ht/~fancycade/mysterio
[23:23:19] <fancycade> the jose dependency caused the compilation time to go up a lot
[23:24:03] <fancycade> on a brand new release project it says it is compiling when i run shell
[23:25:49] <fancycade> fresh compilation on my app (after deleting _build) is certainly much slower then when running shell
[23:26:31] <tristan> definitely something wrong. I see it is running a compile on every dep each time I run rebar3 shell
[23:29:50] <fancycade> :( i feel like im not doing anything too crazy, thanks for letting me know there is a better way
[23:30:15] <tristan> and it is definitely something with jose
[23:31:02] <tristan> oh
[23:31:40] <tristan> the version in jose.app is wrong
[23:32:15] <tristan> rebar3 thinks it has to upgrade jose everytime because the lock is for jose 1.11.2 but the .app file is 1.11.1
[23:32:15] <fancycade> it tries to upgrade every time it recompiles
[23:32:19] <tristan> yea
[23:32:25] <tristan> so its a bug in their package
[23:33:28] <tristan> replace `jose` with `{jose, "1.11.1"}`, rm rebar.lock or run 'rebar3 upgrade' and the issue is gone
[23:34:22] <tristan> https://github.com/potatosalad/erlang-jose/pull/122
[23:34:38] <tristan> they need to publish 1.11.3
[23:35:15] <fancycade> omg so much better
[23:35:26] <fancycade> i cant believe i was suffering through that for a couple of days
[23:35:54] <fancycade> thank you, i will set the version for now until they publish the new version
[23:36:22] <tristan> hm, possible that rebar3 could be improved to notice something like this. a mismatch between the package version and the app version 
[23:36:25] <tristan> np
