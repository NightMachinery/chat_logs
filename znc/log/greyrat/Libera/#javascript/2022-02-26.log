[00:04:03] <blueagain> ljharb: I just discovered node has stream/web
[00:04:11] <blueagain> via the mdn page for the Streams API
[00:04:26] <stenno> indeed
[00:04:27] *** Joins: z1haze (~z1haze@user/z1haze)
[00:04:30] <stenno> finally a decent stream api
[00:04:42] <blueagain> has had it since 16.5, that's pretty cool for portability
[00:04:59] <stenno> portability is overrated in that case at least imo
[00:05:13] <z1haze> anyone familiar enough with the workspace/packages fields in a package.json to break down in laymen's terms how it works and what a realworld usecase might be?
[00:05:19] <ljharb> i don't know if it's decent
[00:05:22] <ljharb> but it's "what the web has"
[00:05:39] <ljharb> z1haze: are you familiar with any monorepo tooling?
[00:05:41] <ljharb> yarn, lerna, etc?
[00:05:49] <blueagain> stenno: if you use the es import in node your code is 1:1 portable, given you're not using any node-particular deps
[00:05:58] <ljharb> false
[00:06:02] *** Quits: maret (~maret@nat-88-212-37-89.antik.sk) (Quit: maret)
[00:06:22] <ljharb> blueagain: to be truly portable you must be using zero deps, because import maps aren't standard in browsers yet
[00:06:34] <ljharb> blueagain: native ESM has only downsides; stick to transpiled ESM.
[00:06:34] <blueagain> oh right, you don't need the import at all in the browser
[00:06:38] <ljharb> (in browsers too)
[00:06:41] <z1haze> no, unfortunately i am not
[00:06:50] <ljharb> z1haze: what about with the concept of a monorepo at all?
[00:07:01] <stenno> i thought import maps were supported by default by modern browsers
[00:07:06] <z1haze> i dont believe so. at least im not familiar with the term
[00:07:32] <z1haze> i guess i have fallen behind
[00:07:55] <ljharb> stenno: only in chrome, so no
[00:08:02] <ljharb> z1haze: monorepos aren't a good thing, you're fine
[00:08:16] <ljharb> z1haze: it's usually when a big company tries to shove multiple projects into the same repo, because they misunderstand the tradeoffs
[00:08:30] <ljharb> but, once you DO that, you need tooling to manage it, and "workspaces" is the category of tooling that does
[00:08:51] * joepie91 grumbles something about monorepos being an indictment of the sorry ideological state of modern FOSS communities
[00:09:04] <z1haze> so are they independent projects but in the same repo?
[00:09:07] <ljharb> not sure what it has to do with foss
[00:09:08] <ljharb> z1haze: yes
[00:09:18] <ljharb> z1haze: often, conceptually related, but still independent
[00:09:31] <ljharb> z1haze: for example, the airbnb styleguide is a monorepo
[00:09:33] <ljharb> z1haze: also enzyme
[00:09:38] <blueagain> is there any particular reason that imports without ending wouldn't be possible in the browser too?
[00:09:45] <ljharb> blueagain: what do you mean "without ending"
[00:09:53] <ljharb> blueagain: bare specifiers are not allowed in the browser at all
[00:10:00] <blueagain> yeah, but why not?
[00:10:02] <ljharb> blueagain: chrome supports them via import maps which are still quite nonstandard
[00:10:03] <z1haze> ljharb, can you see this? https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/sfcc-sample-apps
[00:10:15] <ljharb> blueagain: because in browsers, specifiers are URLs, and they wanted to reserve bare specifiers for possible compat with node
[00:10:50] <ljharb> blueagain: but even if import maps become standard, native esm will still be worse than transpiling and bundling, for the foreseeable future
[00:10:54] <joepie91> ljharb: monorepos are conceptually antithetical to the core concept of FOSS, which is that anybody should have the freedom to modify and fork as they desire, and that it is *desirable* for a broader community to independently iterate on designs and concepts. because with a monorepo, the cost of doing so is a lot higher - there are almost always implicit dependencies between components in a monorepo, often shared build processes, and this means that
[00:10:54] <joepie91> instead of the project being optimized for discrete forkable components, you need to pull in an entire bag of complexity in such a fork and it'll almost always be difficult to integrate with upstream components

[00:11:20] <blueagain> oh :(
[00:11:23] <ljharb> joepie91: that seems like perhaps an unintended consequence of it, but not directly related
[00:11:25] <joepie91> TL;DR forking cost unnecessarily high in monorepos
[00:11:29] <z1haze> what im going is just some research into some new 'headless' api that salesforce has been working on and want to start on a poc. but the example projects are structured differently than im used to. im not sure if its because these packages arent public or what
[00:11:46] <ljharb> joepie91: the cost of forking can be unnecessarily high from a ton of things, and almost never is that because anyone was thinking about foss at all
[00:11:52] <joepie91> ljharb: unintended or not, the fact that this isn't widely called out and considered a Bad Thing says a lot about how 'in touch' modern FOSS communities are with the core ideological principles
[00:11:55] <ljharb> joepie91: a single large project is just as painful

[00:12:14] <ljharb> joepie91: sure, fair. the core principles may not be all that important anymore tho, in the same way as copyleft licenses' time has passed
[00:12:18] *** Quits: src (~src@user/src) (Quit: Leaving)
[00:12:18] <joepie91> because to anyone who is in touch with said principles, this should stand out as an obviously undesirable situation
[00:12:27] <joepie91> they are even more important today than they were in the past
[00:12:38] <joepie91> corporate appropriation of the community does not change that

[00:13:00] <ljharb> z1haze: ok so this is a lerna monorepo
[00:13:14] <joepie91> there's a big difference between "someone who holds an explicitly ideological position" and "a zealot"
[00:13:22] <ljharb> joepie91: oh i didn't mean you
[00:13:35] <ljharb> z1haze: lerna.json configures it, and the root package.json has private true, and it has npm scripts in it that use lerna to manage the subprojects, which are usually in `packages/`

[00:15:50] <blueagain> but I have no clue what it does
[00:15:55] <blueagain> what's CRM?
[00:15:57] <z1haze> well, its much more than a crm. its literally everything
[00:15:58] <ljharb> blueagain: CRM is "customer relationship management"
[00:16:02] <blueagain> oh
[00:16:03] <z1haze> customer relation manager
[00:16:08] <blueagain> so what people used to do with email?
[00:16:10] <ljharb> blueagain: so, any company with a sales staff or a customer service department probably uses it
[00:16:11] <z1haze> but its evolved into just a monster of everything
[00:16:17] <ljharb> blueagain: "used to do" 30 years ago, sure
[00:16:23] <ljharb> blueagain: nobody does it with just email as of this millenium
[00:16:53] <blueagain> but what does it actually give you as an added value? like send automated reminder mails to your customer?
[00:17:21] <z1haze> i think he just said what it gives in the definition of crm
[00:17:28] <ljharb> blueagain: i'm really not trying to make a sales pitch for salesforce here, but such a tool can make or break your entire company
[00:17:38] <blueagain> ok, noted
[00:18:16] <ljharb> a company interacting with customers that doesn't use a CRM tool is like a software company that doesn't use version control

[00:23:07] <stenno> that is also handled by a crm
[00:23:11] <blueagain> I see
[00:23:34] <blueagain> so it's like a collection of tools that support marketing people?
[00:23:48] <ljharb> yes
[00:23:53] <ljharb> and sales, and customer service
[00:23:56] <z1haze> also things like live chat on your website, which will automatically create a case, and link it to a contact and/or a lead. and that gets auto routed to an agent based on the skills the agent needs based on the inquiry. it just goes and goes
[00:23:59] <ljharb> and the executives that want reporting on all of those
[00:24:14] <blueagain> oh, that sounds more tangible already
[00:24:30] <z1haze> salesforce core is "robust" to put it nicely
[00:24:34] <blueagain> so I imagine it's something like
[00:24:38] <z1haze> its so big, and so extensible that its a nightmare to use
[00:24:58] <blueagain> someone writes an email to my company, this system opens up a case and routes it to the person who needs to take care of it? (or possibly 'triage' it?)
[00:25:19] <ljharb> sure
[00:25:35] <z1haze> yes. and then it collects all sorts of analytics, and then builds campaigns based on that. its like someone said earlier. big datamining
[00:25:36] <blueagain> sounds interesting indeed
[00:26:13] <stenno> yeah datamining and targeted advertisement is where it really gets interesting imo
[00:26:42] <stenno> a certain customer bought this and that, lets present to him an advertisement for another product we think he might like
[00:26:48] <blueagain> I was thinking that it was interesting if this system analyses the mail and uses learning methods to route it properly

[00:27:07] <z1haze> but it can

[00:58:35] <systemfault> I usually add dependencies if I have to... not for fun.

[01:04:00] <blueagain> most alternatives I get on xlsx though are larger
[01:04:41] <sheetjs> the relevance to sheetjs is that google invested $10K at the end of July 2019 and the first commit after the investment was in September 2019.  The commit added exactly one new category: "Excel File Readers, Manipulators & Writers"
[01:05:24] <blueagain> that category sucks for the others, not for xlsx though
[01:05:32] <sheetjs> the reason it shows smaller is because we added the ESM build
[01:05:36] <blueagain> only thing that's smaller is excel4node
[01:06:12] <sheetjs> the CJS build is still larger.  node-xlsx is literally a light wrapper around xlsx so you can get a sense for what the size would have been

[01:09:18] <sheetjs> the whole thing worked properly in the past because webpack actually honored the `browser` field node suppression by default.  but now with `type: module`, webpack 5 does something unexpected and now we have to manually strip out the parts webpack doesn't like
[01:11:04] <blueagain> npm says unpacked size is 10 MB on xlsx
[01:11:11] <blueagain> that is without the xls support?
[01:11:20] <sheetjs> yeah there are a number of files in the bundle
[01:12:00] <sheetjs> there's a script for nodejs, a script for esm, a script for photoshop, and a handful of browser scripts for different use cases
[01:12:10] <blueagain> I see
[01:12:38] <systemfault> sheetjs: What does the script for photoshop do?
[01:13:18] <sheetjs> in photoshop and indesign, you can write custom automation scripts.  Some users use the library to read from files and perform actions
[01:13:33] <systemfault> From excel files? Crazy

[04:16:43] <ljharb> blahboybaz: `func1()` is called, the return value has `.func2` accessed off of it, it's called with the return value of func1 as the receiver, and then the return value of `func2()` has `.func3` accessed off of it, and then it's called with the return value of func2 as the receiver

[04:21:45] <blahboybaz> ljharb: In the absense of knowledge (and I know nothing about how chaining works in any language) the answer could, potentially, be anything. Then you add a little common sense to it and it narrows it down to a couple possibilites but still nothing conclusiv

[04:23:55] <Decker> many vector math libraries use a chaining API; that is they always return the target vector; so each return value can immediately be used as an objct and call another method on it

[04:35:51] <blahboybaz> I'm learning about all of it (one bite at a time) I can't do it all at once (I've never met anyone that can). Today I'm learning about chaining. Yesterday it was something different. There is not way to explain to someone what you have already comprehended about somthing nor am I sure it would be helpful. Anyone who has ever tried to learn to code discovers that it takes rigor (the discipline
[04:35:57] <blahboybaz> itself makes that obvious). I'm here year after year because I want to and because I haven't given up (miraculously so).
[04:36:00] <blahboybaz> Decker: When it comes to where a return value is stored I only know if it being stored in a variable. But a function is not a variable (that I know of at my level of understanding) - yet it is a function that the returning function is chained to (not a variable). So when I hear that the furction returns the value to another function I want to know how. With a variable it is through the use of "=".
[04:36:06] <blahboybaz> That I am aware of with functions it is when a function is called and an arguments is "passed in". So how does what is returned for the chained function get in there? Get into the function it is chained to?
[04:36:42] <Decker> it sits around in memory anonymous... you can't use it unless you use it in that statement block/expression.
[04:36:45] <blahboybaz> That's why I suggested that maybe "this" was being used to pass the value (though I don't know)

[08:24:51] <bluehoney> i'm not a js expert, but doesn't chaining take the output of a previous function and pass it into a new function
[08:25:23] <bluehoney> i.e. example.toUpperCase().slice()
[08:27:48] <bluehoney> maybe some different behavior with promises considering .then() and .catch()
[08:36:27] <Decker> it doesn't really pass it to the new function; it calls the next function on that returned object
[08:36:44] <Decker> which implies passing as 'this' since it'sjust object.method()

[08:42:59] <TheFreim> Is there a good way of cutting specific parts out of an HTML string? E.x. I have a long string of HTML returned from an api and I want to retrieve only elements in a certain div. I know I can do this through some searching/splitting/looping/regex type action but maybe theres a better cleaner way
[08:44:14] <blahboybaz> TheFreim: regex? idk. I'm just guessing.. trying to be helpful
[08:44:19] <blahboybaz> xpath?
[08:44:24] <ljharb> blahboybaz: ftr you weren't authed when you said your Curried thing, so nobody saw it
[08:44:44] <ljharb> blahboybaz: it's not chaining unless it's using `.` or `[]` to grab a property off the previous return value

[08:45:58] <TheFreim> blahboybaz: xpath looks interesting ill check that out
[08:46:40] <blahboybaz> I mean, I know that to implement chaining involves "." or "[]" but I was more focusing on how chaining does what it does
[08:46:43] <blahboybaz> its all good
[08:47:16] <blahboybaz> TheFreim: right on
[08:47:21] <ljharb> it's just that a method returns an object, that has more methods
[08:47:31] <ljharb> that's all chaining is
[08:47:54] <blahboybaz> has more methods inside the object you mean?
[08:48:37] <ljharb> blahboybaz: they don't have to be the same object
[08:48:57] <ljharb> blahboybaz: you can call a method on object A that returns object B. then call a method on object B that returns object C. that's chaining
[08:49:07] <ljharb> it's just that they're *usually* the same object, or same kind of object.
[08:49:19] <blahboybaz> so function(){ return {function(){ return { ... }}}}
[08:49:20] <blahboybaz> ?
[08:49:46] <ljharb> blahboybaz: no, those are just funcitons
[08:49:49] <ljharb> chaining requires *methods*
[08:49:54] <ljharb> an object that HOLDS a function
[08:50:05] <ljharb> `foo()()()()` isn't chaining
[08:50:17] <blahboybaz> hmm
[08:50:27] <ljharb> blahboybaz: i know you said you're trying to learn a little piece but the way to do that is a page of Eloquent at a time

[08:53:31] <ljharb> i do understand that. i'm not saying a book, or this book, is the only way through. i'm trying to politely say that you're focusing too deeply on a specific emergent property of the way objects and methods work
[08:53:45] <ljharb> you need to first learn how objects and functions work - language basics - and then you'll understand chaining intuitively
[08:53:53] <theskillwithin> maybe they will turn the book into a movie someday
[08:54:33] <blahboybaz> Thanks for pointing that out. Perhaps I have learned something about myself along the way that I can not explain to others
[08:54:36] <theskillwithin> https://beginnerjavascript.com/
[08:56:04] <KevinX> Not much to chaining anyway. You find out pretty fast if you're doing it wrong.
[08:56:42] <KevinX> Common mistake is to call array methods on objects
[08:56:59] <blahboybaz> Its cool - I get so frustrated about the way convos go. I used to blow the eff up (in these channels). But I've learned (or started to) that that does no good
[08:57:19] <blahboybaz> I imagine there's some people around here that remember how I was
[08:58:02] <ljharb> under this name, or a different one
[08:58:17] <KevinX> like because you got frustrated with people explaining something?
[08:59:06] <theskillwithin> there is a skill to asking for help,  you get better at it over time, and get faster responses
[08:59:18] <blahboybaz> Because people seem to gravitate toward judging why you want to know what you are asking about and worse than that whether you ought to want to know that
[08:59:27] <blahboybaz> Then they make assumptions
[08:59:41] <blahboybaz> Then they show that they've completely ignored stuff you've said
[08:59:59] <blahboybaz> I have to stop and realize (try to) that they're (hopefully) trying to help
[09:00:02] <ljharb> judging why people want what they're asking about is necessary, because most people fail to provide it
[09:00:11] <ljharb> almost every single question people ask is an xy problem
[09:00:19] <theskillwithin> !xy
[09:00:19] <jellobot> theskillwithin, The XY problem: You want to do X, but don't know how. You think you can solve it using Y, but don't know how to do that either. You ask about Y, which is a strange thing to want to do. Just ask about X. See also: http://xyproblem.info/
[09:01:10] <blahboybaz> Alomost every question I ask has to do with HOW something does what it does. Occasionally its about how to do something
[09:01:35] *** Joins: silverdust (~silverdus@user/silverdust)
[09:02:19] <ljharb> sure. but it's still useful to know why you want to know that - including, what prompted it
[09:02:43] <ljharb> and in the case of it being a fundamental language thing, it's important for us to know what other gaps you may have
[09:04:41] <blahboybaz> For me I'm just taking it as it comes. I happen to be working through a series of challenges in a code camp but occasionally something I'm working on raises other, deeper questions. Somtimes things (questions about things) just pop into my head from God knows where
[09:04:45] <blahboybaz> thats my life
[09:06:13] <KevinX> the question might be too hard too if you're asking how things work behind the scenes. Like if you ask how .sort() works I coulnd't tell ya. quick sort?

[09:06:47] <blahboybaz> sorry I was wrinting that before
[09:06:54] <ThePendulum> I don't think how sort works is defined by the language, is it?

[09:07:48] <ThePendulum> don't just do then, also do catch and await
[09:07:56] <ljharb> ThePendulum: it is
[09:08:03] <ljharb> ThePendulum: it is defined to be a stable sort
[09:08:12] <ljharb> as of ES2018 iirc
[09:08:42] <blahboybaz> theskillwithin: That's exacly how I try to appoach it but sometimes even that is inadequate. Sometimes it seems like something mistical is going on right outside the reach of my understanding; and, if I could just grasp it, a whole universe of knowledge (in that language) would open up to me.
[09:08:49] <blahboybaz> Like chaining for example
[09:09:08] <blahboybaz> mystical?
[09:09:35] <ThePendulum> ljharb: so I guess a bit of both then? stable sort is a property of an algo and not one algo right?
[09:09:38] <Decker> there's really nothing magic about it; and insisting there is isn't helping you
[09:10:03] <ljharb> ThePendulum: true. but it's specified enough
[09:10:03] <KevinX> Everything is magic until you understand it
[09:10:05] <blahboybaz> its an allegory (allegory? is that right?)
[09:10:08] <ljharb> blahboybaz: no, it's not
[09:10:21] <blahboybaz> it wasn't meant literally but I think that's obvious
[09:10:21] <ljharb> blahboybaz: it is literally just an object method that returns an object, that has more methods
[09:10:33] <ljharb> oh you mean your magic comment is an allegory, sure
[09:10:39] <blahboybaz> yeah
[09:11:14] <KevinX> the only gotcha with chaining is that you need to make sure the object returned from the previous method has the next method on its prototype
[09:11:15] <blahboybaz> What KevinX said I agree with " Everything is magic until you understand it "  and so I aim to understand it

[09:12:03] <blahboybaz> KevinX:  discovering how something works makes it not "magic" anymore (so to say)
[09:12:14] <KevinX> but tooling usually helps there more than anything else
[09:12:22] <blahboybaz> ljharb: I get that - I undestand object prototypes a little bit
[09:12:27] <theskillwithin> within reason, learning takes time,  experience, learning how to be resourceful,  learning how to learn
[09:12:33] <KevinX> and executing the code and seeing the negative feedback
[09:12:54] <blahboybaz> ev in js is an object and prototypes define them
[09:13:03] <ljharb> not everything
[09:13:06] <ljharb> there's also primitives.
[09:13:16] <ljharb> and not every object has a prototype; an object can have a null prototype
[09:13:48] <ThePendulum> I still don't quite understand prototypes. or I guess I think I do but I've never used them and I feel like I would have if I understood them properly
[09:14:01] <KevinX> famously, `Object.create(null)`
[09:14:50] <KevinX> ThePendulum you mean adding methods to the prototype?

[21:29:25] <EdFletcher> a quick thought experiment will show that it is implementation dependent: if the underlying data structure is indeed a list (in-memory or singly-linked) then unshift must be O(n). if it's implemented as a doubly-linked list (unlikely but possible) _then_ unshift could be O(1).
[21:29:48] <EdFletcher> but really: this is javascript, you needn't care about that. use the methods that make semantic sense and move on.
[21:30:09] <rendar> EdFletcher, no, i should care, i don't want to use O(n)
[21:30:42] *** Quits: phryk (~totallyno@user/phryk) (Remote host closed the connection)
[21:31:24] <blueagain> rendar: that sounds a bit like premature optimisation to me
[21:31:31] <EdFletcher> ^this
[21:32:23] <EdFletcher> is your _n_ very large already, so large that O(n) is actually a significant slowdown over O(1)? 'Fancy algorithms are slow when n is small, and n is usually small.' https://twitter.com/CompSciFact/status/1495879759854817284
[21:32:23] <rendar> blueagain, that's why that kiwiirc application takes 100% CPU (Threadripper) for some seconds, when it logs like 5000 lines of log of irc channels
[21:32:34] <rendar> EdFletcher, yep
[21:32:39] <rendar> otherwise i wouldn't car
[21:32:43] <rendar> care*
[21:32:52] <Svitkona> 5000 is not that much at all...
[21:32:58] <EdFletcher> and you're already having performance troubles?
[21:33:09] <rendar> Svitkona, indeed!
[21:33:19] <rendar> Svitkona, but it's bugged like hell
[21:33:33] <rendar> EdFletcher, not yet, since my project doesn't exist yet
[21:33:46] <Svitkona> it's probably not because they're using an O(n) unshift
[21:33:47] <blueagain> I don't think that unshift will majorly impact the performance of your project
[21:33:50] <EdFletcher> rendar: ah ha! so it _is_ premature optimization.
[21:34:01] <rendar> EdFletcher, what?
[21:34:14] * rendar facepalms

[21:34:33] <EdFletcher> yes i know
[21:34:39] <rendar> see ya
