[01:50:51] <Diablo-D3> aint rick and morty
[01:51:40] <MatthiasVance> Those were what I already watched ðŸ˜‚
[01:52:00] <Diablo-D3> ahh
[01:52:04] <Diablo-D3> you havent seen futurama?1
[01:52:07] <Nasp> So the Fukushima disaster is almost 10 years away now, and it still have a huge impact in todays choice if one should use nuclear or not
[01:52:21] <Diablo-D3> yeah which is nuts
[01:52:26] <MatthiasVance> No Diablo-D3 starting now
[01:52:26] <Diablo-D3> it isnt that if someone should use it or not
[01:52:39] <Diablo-D3> its that if you enforce your regulations or not, and if you punish appropriately or not
[01:52:46] <Nasp> Yeah
[01:52:51] <Diablo-D3> japan has a fucking history of letting companies fucking do this shit
[01:52:54] <Nasp> Also like i thought it was redundancies on redundancies
[01:53:13] <Nasp> Lets put the diesel generator on the ground floor
[01:53:18] <Diablo-D3> the reactor was no longer certifiable, it was recertified again
[01:53:36] <Diablo-D3> japan fucked up.
[01:53:45] <Diablo-D3> the japanese government fucked up.
[01:53:55] <Nasp> Seems more and more people want nuclear power now
[01:54:00] <Diablo-D3> and if they let the japanese government say no to nuclear, then the people fucked up.
[01:54:01] <Nasp> But goverments are affraid
[01:54:07] <irwiss> Nasp: the worst part is that fukushima is still running on failed design from the 80ies, but it reflects on modern nuclear power plants
[01:54:08] <Nasp> We are focusing on windmill and coal + wood
[01:54:10] <Diablo-D3> governments should be afraid... of the people.
[01:54:33] <Diablo-D3> MatthiasVance: btw, you're a horrible human being if you havent seen futurama at least 3 times
[01:54:36] <Nasp> When your electricity bill doubles due to no wind...
[01:54:39] <irwiss> or rather, ran on it, before it went tits up
[01:54:52] <Diablo-D3> irwiss: not quite
[01:55:02] <Diablo-D3> its a design from the 60s that wasnt failed
[01:55:13] <Diablo-D3> the japanese government greenlit a design that was out of date.
[01:55:15] <Nasp> Have multiple generators, have offsite generators in trucks as well
[01:55:18] <Nasp> Like plan for everything
[01:55:21] <Nasp> But money money money
[01:55:23] <Diablo-D3> yup
[01:55:30] <Diablo-D3> and these re all _international_ regulations
[01:55:35] <Diablo-D3> nuclear regulations are paved in blood
[01:55:55] <Nasp> People are affraid of nuclear, but burning coal is fine
[01:56:10] <Nasp> Even though there is much more materials being spewed out into the atmosphere burning coal and wood
[01:56:17] <irwiss> yep, money because everyone wants profit but not building modern power plants to replace old (even though old designs are proven to fail)
[01:56:28] <irwiss> especially with political pressure against new ones
[01:56:45] <irwiss> rather burn coal and fuck up everyone's lungs
[01:57:00] <Nasp> OR build more windmills so the electricity prices increases even more
[01:57:14] <Nasp> Like reports have shown we can't build more windmills to coverage electricity usage

[02:14:38] <Nasp> I was that it :D
[02:15:29] <Nasp> Or*
[02:17:37] <_genuser_> Nasp basically an annoying little exercise. Design this, design that. Annoying. And then they'll analyze it. So you just design and turn it in. No opportunity to actually look at it long enough to change it, fix it.
[02:17:53] <Nasp> How much dev experience do you have?
[02:18:03] <Nasp> BEcause next time i switch job i dont want to do any of those exercise
[02:18:07] <Nasp> Hire me or dont :D
[02:18:33] <_genuser_> I have tooooooons of experience. I don't claim any of it to be useful experience, lol.
[02:19:24] <_genuser_> I've been working for a good 20years in corporate. But this team said lot of decision making power in how your arrange your work and your workday. So I'm actually interested enough to work on the exercise.

[03:11:03] <_genuser_> I get fully vaccinated and all
[03:11:16] <khanred_> I'm up the the third dose
[03:11:38] <_genuser_> our work is allowing people to make up their own mind.
[03:12:00] <khanred_> We're not required, I'm just a smelly liberal
[03:12:03] <_genuser_> but I hear citi (not my employer) is giving everyone till the end of the month to get vaccinated or lose their jobs.
[03:12:33] <khanred_> I think it's a good idea to get vaccinated but requiring everyone (outside of the medical field perhaps) seems impractical
[03:14:29] <BtbN> For us it's be vaccinated or in the back office or at home. If you can't do that, bye.
[03:15:07] <BtbN> Seems fair though, given we're a university and kinda in contact with a ton of people.
[03:16:12] <_genuser_> vaccine is a personal matter. And a serious thing. I don't think I should influence others to not get it or to get it.
[03:16:30] <_genuser_> best to work with personal physician and assess risk and work off that.
[03:16:57] <BtbN> We're about to have a country wide vaccine mandate. Cause we have TOO MANY idiots not getting it, so the health system can't cope with rescuing them all
[03:17:27] <_genuser_> hmm pretty narrow minded view. but meh.
[03:17:32] <BtbN> ~70% of the country is vaccinated at least once.
[03:17:42] <khanred_> BtbN, which country?
[03:17:45] <BtbN> Germany
[03:17:50] <khanred_> I see
[03:17:54] <BtbN> And close to 85% of people in the ICUs are unvaccinated
[03:18:05] <BtbN> meanwhile we're out of ICU and almost out of regular hospital beds
[03:18:12] <khanred_> same
[03:18:15] <_genuser_> countries like Israel has almost 100% vaccination rate and their ICUs are flooded with vaccinated people.
[03:18:43] <BtbN> That's a very misleading view on it. If they were only 50% vaccinated, imagine how the ICUs, and the streets in from of them, looked right now
[03:18:56] <BtbN> Germany is demonstrating it right now
[03:18:59] *** Quits: Klinda (~superleag@user/klinda) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[03:19:13] <BtbN> at ~70% population wide vaccination, almost 90% of ICU patients are unvaccinated
[03:19:25] <_genuser_> it's all misleading views. Numbers is the easiest way to lie.
[03:19:45] <_genuser_> presented this way or that way to suit this argument or that argument.
[03:20:04] <BtbN> 90% of ICU patients that are on the ICU because of Covid, I should add
[03:20:29] <khanred_> So anyway
[03:20:34] <BtbN> Poor sods that need an ICU bed for other reasons right now. All blocked by unvaccinated people with covid...
[03:21:22] <BtbN> And poor doctors and nurses that need to deal with patients that are fighting death, and still rejecting proper medicine, asking for their essential oils.
[03:21:44] <BtbN> No idea how common that is, but it has happened at least a couple times
[03:22:08] <_genuser_> khanred_ ok, so back to your situation. Sounds like 1 day a week from office isn't too bad.
[03:22:15] <_genuser_> khanred_ unless you want fully remote?
[03:22:26] <khanred_> _genuser_, I don't mind the one day a week
[03:23:02] <khanred_> But all of our meetings are over Zoom still, and all of my team but my TL and myself are in the Dallas office for their day now
[03:23:44] <_genuser_> khanred_ our work is supposed to go hybrid sometime this year. And I don't like the idea.
[03:23:47] <_genuser_> I just want to work remote now.

[21:21:02] <Nasp> Console app, mvc, desktop?
[21:21:41] <_genuser_> Nasp Console app. So I setup the DI everythinng. Then I want to retrieve the first thing, then kick it off. Then the DI framework should resolve the dep graph and provide everything else with injected deps.

[22:03:01] <Nasp> Because if he / she is 15 year old then she's born in western times
[22:03:39] <Slade> born 2000 i think.
[22:03:50] <Slade> 90s are becoming modern, 80s are definitely western
[22:04:36] <Nasp> Cellphones got mainstream early 2000-2005 right?
[22:04:57] <MichaelLong> roughly, probably 2-3 years earlier
[22:05:41] <Nasp> For mainstream?
[22:05:57] <Nasp> Like everyone and their mom had one?
[22:06:03] <MichaelLong> it was the prime time for Nokia phones
[22:06:16] *** Quits: daemon (znc@about/web/TheBeardedBSDer) (Quit: ZNC 1.8.2 - https://znc.in)
[22:06:24] <bpmedley> My first cell phone was a Nokia in 2000 or 2001.
[22:06:42] <Slade> yea 1999 flip phones were everywhere.
[22:06:45] <Nasp> 3310 is from 2000
[22:06:46] <MichaelLong> Nasp, I can be wrong.
[22:06:55] <Nasp> Which was the most mainstream phone
[22:07:02] <Nasp> So i would still argue 2000-2005
[22:07:12] <Nasp> Sure flipphones existed before, but at 2005 everyone had a mobile phone
[22:08:14] <Slade> i'd say by the time the motorola razr came out, basically everyone had a cellphone
[22:08:23] <Slade> in the US
[22:08:35] <Slade> that was 2003
[22:08:52] <MichaelLong> I can remember my older  brother had a nokia 7110 definately before 2000 but not long before.
[22:09:22] <biberu> i don't think i had a landline since the 90s
[22:09:32] <Nasp> I've never personally had a landline
[22:09:44] <Nasp> I dont even know where my landline connection is in my apartment
[22:09:51] <Slade> the googles say 405 million cellphones were sold in 2000
[22:09:54] <MichaelLong> I had one because of pre-FTTH interwebs connection done over it
[22:13:07] <Slade> https://www.etsy.com/listing/662464431/vintage-gsm-phone-sony-model-qn-cd5bps   dang with the wheel!
[22:13:17] <MichaelLong> I can remember another phenomenon, most likely more a US thing, those small little SMS-boxes often worn at the belt, can be seen in movies and series. Don't know whether it was also available in west-germany at that time. cannot remember the name right now
[22:13:49] <MichaelLong> I would say it was a thing of the mid-90
