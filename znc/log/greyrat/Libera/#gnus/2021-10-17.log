[08:03:50] <TOB_CyxoB> Hi, is there a good book / tutorial on how to use gnus as e-mail client? I mean there is "info" but it seems to jump from topic to topic without any flow and very few examples (if any.)

[08:36:31] <TOB_CyxoB> Ha-ha: Often when I read the manual, I think that we should take a collection up to have Lars psycho-analysed.
