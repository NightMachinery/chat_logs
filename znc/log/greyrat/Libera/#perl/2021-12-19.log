[02:34:40] <simcop2387> daemon: wonder if you can set it to allow public sign ups for @cpan.org addresses
[02:34:53] <ology> +1
[02:36:04] <daemon> should be able to
[02:36:15] <daemon> wait that would be email based auth
[02:36:22] <daemon> unless you want it to reach out to cpan.org and validate somehow
[02:36:45] <daemon> you thinking @cpan.org auto == editor?
[02:37:03] <Grinnz> it's a wiki, you could allow editing without any login if you want
[02:37:09] <Grinnz> it keeps history for a reason
[02:37:21] <daemon> yeah but do not want it full of spam all the time
[02:37:27] <Grinnz> meh
[02:37:44] <daemon> depends how many people are going to volunteer as admins to what it gets setat
[02:37:52] <daemon> I would think
[02:38:03] <daemon> I will set it to whatever the community wants really
[02:40:59] <daemon> could be interesting to install a ldap server next to it
[02:41:07] <daemon> with keycloak 
[02:41:13] <daemon> could serve as a public SSO for perl stugg
[02:41:14] <daemon> stuff*
[02:41:17] <daemon> might be intersting
[02:41:33] <daemon> though would make more sense for cpan.org to do that
[02:42:46] <daemon> my plan here was to get a domain, plonk it on a server and install the wiki I kinda was relying on everyone helping out from this point :P 
[02:42:57] <simcop2387> daemon: wonder if there's easy github and gitlab oauth support.  modern auth for pause/cpan would be nice
[02:43:09] <daemon> https://dpaste.org/Tn0y
[02:43:14] <daemon> one of the plugins I loaded was OAuth
[02:43:29] <simcop2387> yea it'll take a bit for people to get to loading it up with stuff
[02:43:30] <daemon> as for pause/cpan, the easiest thing for them to do would be to use keycloak
[02:43:38] <daemon> which offers Oauth from multiple different backends
[02:43:40] <daemon> even custom ones
[02:43:40] <Grinnz> auth for pause is a non-starter until pause supports oauth
[02:43:51] <Grinnz> also kind of pointless for this, imo
[02:44:17] <simcop2387> Grinnz: i just like the idea of automatically allowing accounts for cpan authors as a quick way of having lots of valid users
[02:44:39] <daemon> so what I need to find is someone who knows how to get github/sso work on mediawiki
[02:44:45] <Grinnz> meh. if you can oauth to github and don't need to login to edit that covers enough
[02:44:45] <daemon> to work *
[02:46:01] <simcop2387> daemon: looks like this'd be what you need, https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:OAuth2_Client
[02:46:01] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ Extension:OAuth2 Client - MediaWiki ]
[02:46:16] <daemon> that looks sane
[02:46:27] <daemon> why do people use submodules in git
[02:46:50] <daemon> ill have to write a dockerfile to take their image and add it into the image, should not take long
[02:47:50] *** Joins: monkey_ (~user@190.104.116.153)
[02:50:12] <simcop2387> daemon: yea i'd recommend github and gitlab for oauth for it as easy places to get users for it.  anyone who won't, or can't, use those then could be handled case by case for whatever is happen
[02:50:32] <daemon> I kinda doubt anyone who uses perl does not have a github account >.>
[02:50:45] <daemon> or gitlab
[02:50:58] <daemon> would be fun to use IRC as a SSO
[02:51:12] <daemon> [sign on via irc] you must /msg BOT <CODE>
[02:51:17] <daemon> bot checks what they are signed in as
[02:51:17] <daemon> :P
[02:51:18] <simcop2387> though i don't see how to use two oauth providers with that
[02:51:32] <daemon> when I see other sites do this, you have to like link accounts
[02:51:34] <simcop2387> daemon: ircv3 does let that work actually, so it's doable
[02:52:52] <daemon> be a cute little aside and I think I could get keycloak to do that
[02:53:15] <daemon> but yeah when you can sign in with multiple SSO's what I ahve seen is you sign in the first time, and then you have to 'link' accounts
[02:53:28] <daemon> which basically does a SSO with whoever else you have
[02:53:32] <daemon> and then you can sign on with either
[02:53:43] <daemon> no idea how it actually works though
[02:56:13] <simcop2387> this actually looks like a better oauth plugin, https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:WSOAuth
[02:56:13] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ Extension:WSOAuth - MediaWiki ]

[09:18:04] <chlorine> i need to match a character, say 'o' in a string, say 'onion'. the string may contain the character any number of times including zero. i'm trying to find the position of the match by inspecting the @- variable but not getting proper positions. i'm using /(o)/g regex to match in 'onion' string. any help?
[09:19:16] *** Quits: Affliction (affliction@idlerpg/player/affliction) (Quit: Read error: Connection reset by beer)
[09:19:24] <chlorine> when i try to print @- it says 00 whereas i think it should say 03 because the first 'o' is in 0 position and the second 'o' is in 3 position. what mistake am i making?

[09:24:29] <xenu> /g matches regex multiple times and with each match @- gets reset. $-[0] is basically the offset of the first matched character and $-[1] is the offset of $1, in your case they're the same
[09:25:02] <xenu> you either should put that regex in a loop and check $-[1] in each iteration
[09:25:35] <xenu> or rewrite regex like this: /(o[^o]*)+/

[09:39:42] <Adura> (scope considered)
[09:39:45] <chlorine> Adura: that's what i was confused about. i figured the regex has to run once and supplies positions just like capture groups.

[23:42:28] <aquanight> gordonfish: yes exactly. But I really question how many situations do I want to do math on a reference's address?
[23:43:04] <aquanight> C/C++ technically has this same problem, you get ptrdiff_t, but in this case the typo situation isn't as easy to happen.\
[23:43:57] <aquanight> I guess it's a downside of the postfix-dereference style
[23:44:39] <aquanight> but prefix style I feel like I'd have to do ${$var}[7] because I'd be paranoid over $$var[7] being taken as ${$var[7]} instead
[23:45:01] <aquanight> at least that'd be compile-time detected (it'd complain about @var)
[23:45:18] <gordonfish> It isn't so much math on a ref address, but on the result of numification. So the question might be is why that numification occurs.
[23:45:28] <aquanight> I think I tend to prefer postfix deref when I'm indexing
[23:45:45] <aquanight> well yes
[23:46:04] <aquanight> I mean realistically if I had the choice I'd rather just remove stringification/numification of references without an overload
[23:46:11] <aquanight> we have Scalar::Util::refaddr if you really wanted that
[23:46:25] <aquanight> but
[23:46:34] <aquanight> the problem is numification has a useful purpose

[23:52:17] <aquanight> there it is
[23:52:34] <gordonfish> Mmm, pi
[23:53:14] <aquanight> yeah this stupid shit has me second guessing my trig identities now
[23:53:42] * gordonfish . o O (Is a pizza still a pie if it's square, especially if it's cut /into/ squares?)
[23:53:43] <aquanight> sweval: use constant DEG90 => atan2(1,1)*2; [ sin DEG90, cos DEG90 ]
[23:53:44] <perlbot> aquanight: [1,"6.12323399573677e-17"]
[23:53:52] <aquanight> ..
[23:53:56] <aquanight> fucking floats.
[23:54:12] <aquanight> gordonfish: detroit style pizza
[23:54:34] <aquanight> I would almost argue it should classify as a cake.
[23:55:05] <gordonfish> I need to check that out.
[23:55:39] <gordonfish> For atan2, isn't that in radians, instead of degrees?
[23:55:45] <aquanight> it is
[23:56:00] <aquanight> pi/2 radians = 90 degrees
[23:56:11] <gordonfish> Then for DEG90 you'd need rad2deg
[23:56:19] <gordonfish> Oh
[23:56:22] <gordonfish> I ser
[23:56:26] <gordonfish> see*
[23:56:26] <aquanight> why when I'm sending them straight to sin/cos
[23:56:46] <aquanight> the point was I needed to remember I'm not insane about the trig identities
[23:56:54] <aquanight> sin(90d) = 1, cos(90d) = 0
[23:57:16] <gordonfish> Good point, the DEG in DEG90 just threw me for a min and sec.
[23:57:16] <aquanight> today's advent is sending me down the rabbit hole that is affine transformation matriices
[23:57:22] <aquanight> I'm annoyedby this.
[23:58:24] <aquanight> I probably didn't need full-blown affine matrices. I could've probably done with just rotation matrices and apply translation separately. But fuck it I'm going all-in.
[23:59:16] <aquanight> The problem is, in theory when you take an X/Y/Z coordinate system there's apparently 24 different ways you can rotate it (in increments of 90 degrees) and for some reason I've made a complete mess of that..
