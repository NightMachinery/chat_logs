[01:41:14] <causative> Nietzsche was wrong about the "will to power," people's motivations are much more complex than that
[01:42:00] <causative> it ignores the desire for social status, it ignores kin selection and other reasons for altruism
[01:42:29] <Thilastiko> moral realism is just the methadone big philosophy pushes to keep people in spiritual poverty
[01:42:37] <causative> it ignores the tit-for-tat solution to the iterated prisoner's dilemma
[01:43:04] <Thilastiko> "will der macht" is not a "persons" motivation
[01:43:07] <causative> it doesn't even convincingly say what is "power"
[01:43:14] <Thilastiko> options
[01:43:26] <Thilastiko> the more power you have the more options you have
[01:43:48] <causative> so you just count the number of options, and more options is more power?
[01:44:00] <Thilastiko> will to power is the natural process of things that survive to accumulate more and more options for survial
[01:44:04] <causative> answer the question
[01:44:07] <Thilastiko> basically just darwin
[01:44:15] <Thilastiko> yes
[01:44:16] <causative> are you assuming a finite number of options, that we can count so as to compare one set to another?
[01:44:32] <Thilastiko> not finite, but countable
[01:44:52] <causative> any two countable sets have the same cardinality, so if the option sets are all countable then your definition is empty
[01:46:29] <Thilastiko> there are different ordinalities for cardinality

[01:47:34] <Thilastiko> and I get to choose which one I want - because i'm more powerful
[01:47:55] <causative> say two men are each locked in a different box, with buttons they can press.  Each button gives the man some food or water.  The first man has ten buttons, which all give him terrible, rotten food.  The second man has three buttons, which give him good food.  Which man is more powerful?

[01:57:18] <causative> it is necessary to imagine that time is a flat circle, for your philosophy to make sense?  it does not make sense if we suppose the normal linear time?
[01:57:20] <Thilastiko> and who are you to quatify possible futures
[01:57:58] <causative> let's use an example
[01:58:07] <Thilastiko> potentials can give rise to later potentials not originally present
[01:58:31] <causative> suppose you want a Subway sandwich but you only have $5.00, which is enough to buy let's say a BLT or a meatball sub but not both
[01:58:35] <Thilastiko> like a recursive list
[01:58:50] <causative> and suppose you also spot $100 on the ground in an alley
[01:59:05] <causative> your "will to power" says you can "Grow" your potential by picking up the $100 and taking both sandwiches
[01:59:22] <causative> so after you've picked up the $100, the power to take both sandwiches has opened up, yes?
[01:59:44] <causative> except you had that power to begin with - because even before you had the $100, you had the power to take the $100 and then take both sandwiches
[01:59:48] <Thilastiko> I would stab the sandwitch artist, take both sandwiches, burn the $5 and then start my own country where money is irrelevant
[01:59:57] <causative> then you would be imprisoned
[02:00:24] <Thilastiko> thats bitch morality talking

[02:02:11] <ro-bot-o> [url] Philosophy Overdose - Existential Comics | existentialcomics.com
[02:02:45] <Thilastiko> "moral realism" is pretending morality is real - which isnt realistic
[02:03:24] <Thilastiko> What Neitzche calls will der macht, you can just think of as "green lights"
[02:04:03] <Thilastiko> we should ordersociety to have as many green lights at once as possible, and not fixate on the rules for breaking a red light
[02:04:14] <causative> regardless of whether morality is real, it is a fact that most people's motivations are more complex than simply seeking personal power all the time
[02:04:39] <causative> and it is a fact that if you go around breaking a lot of laws you're going to have a bad time and you aren't going to become powerful
[02:05:00] <causative> well, ok, that depends on the laws
[02:05:07] <causative> and on how you go about it
[02:05:09] <Thilastiko> its not "peoples" motivations
[02:05:15] <causative> whose motivations, then?
[02:05:48] <Thilastiko> the basic forces of the universe can be looked at teleologically as a motivation for more and more options
[02:06:26] <causative> a motivation for who?
[02:06:33] <Thilastiko> both Neitzsche and Scheupenhauer look at aristotle's "final causes" as a way t oanthropomorphize the whole universe
[02:07:10] <Thilastiko> you are made of little atoms each with little wills to run after some charges and avoid others
[02:07:31] <causative> that sounds like panpsychism
[02:07:51] <Thilastiko> not psyche, just id, WILL
[02:07:53] <causative> I hadn't heard of Nietzsche being a panpsychist
[02:08:03] <causative> I'm a panpsychist
[02:08:09] <Thilastiko> not pansychism just WILL MOTHERFUCKER
[02:08:17] <causative> will is part of the psyche
[02:08:28] <Thilastiko> just a part
[02:08:37] <Thilastiko> a part scheupenhauer says to ignore
[02:08:39] <causative> it's not separable
[02:08:48] <Thilastiko> and neitzche says to loose yourself in
[02:09:05] <causative> you can't have a psyche that's entirely without will, because meaning derives from will
[02:09:05] <Thilastiko> will is a foundation of a physche
[02:09:35] <causative> we interpret our senses according to how they help us achieve our goals
[02:09:54] <Thilastiko> where do your goals come from
[02:09:55] <Thilastiko> ?
[02:10:03] <causative> biology and upbringing
[02:10:28] <Thilastiko> are they helping cultivate all life on earth? or are they counting down the days to the end of the world
[02:10:39] <Thilastiko> real, healthy motivations promote life
[02:10:39] <causative> not necessarily either
[02:11:04] <causative> biology gave us goals that are arranged to maximize our ability to reproduce
[02:11:05] <Thilastiko> christian, death-loving motivations just want to kill themselves and everything around them
[02:11:30] <Thilastiko> thats why if anything is "evil" christianity is evil
[02:11:32] <causative> the goals biology gave us do not say anything about cultivate life other than our own descendants
[02:11:40] <causative> s/cultivate/cultivating/
[02:11:40] <ro-bot-o> causative meant to say: the goals biology gave us do not say anything about cultivating life other than our own descendants
[02:12:01] <Thilastiko> The will is to increase options
[02:12:34] <causative> in evolution it's to increase descendants, not options
[02:12:35] <Thilastiko> if all your descendants lived in boxes with two buttons that is bitch-morality taking the wheel
[02:13:02] <causative> evolution doesn't "care" if you die after having children - some animals are in fact designed that way.  And that severely cuts down on their options, as they are then dead.
[02:13:08] <I_Am_M00t> Thilastiko: not sure what Snorlax philosophy is. But i think  philosophy creates an illusion of understanding
[02:13:14] <Thilastiko> its evolution to increase the probability of existance, not number of descendants
[02:13:22] <causative> no, evolution does not work that way
[02:13:38] <Thilastiko> ya mon, read the dam selfish gene
[02:13:45] <causative> evolution rewards "have ten children then die at 29" a lot more than "have two children and live to 150"
[02:13:55] <Thilastiko> tell whales that they should maximise their number of descendants
[02:14:25] <causative> how do you think whales would respond to that?
[02:14:43] <Thilastiko> increasing the probability of existing in the future means increasing the possible states where you exist in the future - options bitches
[02:15:16] <Thilastiko> whales are K-strategists, they're all about quality not quantity
[02:16:13] <causative> if a whale could consistently have 10 children and die early, then that whale's descendants would rapidly crowd out the descendants of the other whales
[02:16:26] <causative> as long as the whale isn't worse in some other way

[02:16:53] <I_Am_M00t> ok, that might check out
[02:17:45] <Thilastiko> genes are just abstract information, the number of instantiated versions of a gene is irrelavant except for the fact tht more copies MAY make its existance more probable
[02:18:17] <Thilastiko> at a certain point having too many individuals will cause the whole population to crash in one generation
[02:18:39] <causative> well, that's a reasonable point of view, but it's from the perspective of the gene not the whale
[02:18:57] <Thilastiko> its all the WILL
[02:19:06] <Thilastiko> DER VILL DER MACHT
[02:19:08] <causative> genes want to exist - and they don't care if whales live 150 years or 10 years, whichever fits the niche better
[02:19:22] <Thilastiko> genes dont want anything
[02:19:33] <Thilastiko> they are just sequencs of symbols
[02:19:34] <causative> I thought you were just saying there's a will even in atoms
[02:19:48] <Thilastiko> wanting is a not hte part of a psyche genes have
[02:19:55] <causative> do you say there is a will in atoms, but not a will in genes?
[02:20:01] <Thilastiko> genes are just an expression of DER WILL
[02:21:15] <Thilastiko> if you look at the properties of atoms as final causes, you can say that negative ions are "in love" with positive ions, and "afraid of"other negative ions
[02:21:42] <Thilastiko> it sounds stupid as hell, but can describe all known facts about atoms
[02:22:26] <Thilastiko> it is just a difference in perspective, do you take an "intentional stance" or a "physical stance"
[02:23:01] <Thilastiko> there is nowhere to stand to take a truely "objective stance"
[02:23:08] <Thilastiko> no view from nowhere
[02:24:41] <causative> many natural phenomena can be interpreted as "trying" to achieve some "goal" - or in other words, they can be seen as optimizing for some criterion
[02:24:53] <causative> if we allow "optimizing for a criterion" to mean the same as "trying to achieve a goal"
[02:25:27] <causative> this is the sense in which I say that genes "want to exist" - they are in an evolutionary process that optimizes for the continued existence of genes
[02:26:05] <Thilastiko> ya mon
[02:26:17] <Thilastiko> trying to the extent of "willing"
[02:26:24] <causative> synonym
[02:26:40] <causative> anyway, the point is, this is what the genes want, but it's not what the whales want
[02:27:00] <Thilastiko> nope, adding other parts of a psyche to atoms makes it bullshit

[20:42:35] <arryana> i have a stupid question
[20:42:46] <arryana> don't you worry about a collie herding the cats?
[20:44:15] <pussipupu> Not really, from speaking to the breeder we can train it to not view them as that sort of thing
[20:44:27] <pussipupu> More risk of it trying to herd deer though, as they're about the right size
