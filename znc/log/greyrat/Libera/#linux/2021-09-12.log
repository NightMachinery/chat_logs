[05:25:17] <phogg> for an easy way to access them a symlink from the Nepture user home to the dir in the orca user's home directory would make sense. Or, move them to a shared location not in either user's home.
[05:25:20] <rustytaco> phogg: yea, that was a point i wanted to make known, given how i worded the /etc/profile vs local profile thing
[05:25:45] <Powerhouse6666> phogg, okay, I might as well wait until I have NExtCloud server up
[05:25:49] <phogg> Powerhouse6666: the thing to remember is that permissions by default will probably not allow one user to modify files of another user. You will have to have the users share a group and put those files into that group.
[05:25:59] <rustytaco> yea i'd probably just make a folder elsewhere - homedir should ideally not be world readable or browseable

[08:02:38] <wwalker> I have 2 4TB HDDs in a software RAID1, then I did "mkfs.ext4 -J journal_dev=/.... ..." all good.  When this fs is mounted, about every 3 seconds, the external journal device's led flashes, 1 second after each time that that external journal device's led flashes, both of the HDDs leds flash.  Nothing is using that filesystem!  If I umount it, the flashing stops.  There are not any files on it....

[11:00:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Using the sg3 tools, I verified that putting an SSD in that enclosure did appropriately show that it supports TRIM/Unmap, but without the rule mounting it and attempting fstrim failed.
[11:01:36] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It is using one of the very few USB->SATA chipsets that do support that.

[13:55:23] <Sauvin> The term "cursor" has at least two different meanings for me. One is that blinkie thing on a terminal screen, and the other is a DBMS thing.
[13:55:31] <duoi> No1x3r0 it's useful, thanks
[13:55:54] <Sauvin> Sudoers is not daunting. I just use a subset of it.
[13:56:45] <No1x3r0> Bushmaster Xen let's BSD do the things you describe, but most BSDs will be similar or the same in regards to the context you're mentioning
[13:57:12] <hexnewbie> Even the subset I use requires me going through several BNF expression to refresh my memory what each part does. Wildcard rules are difficult (read: effectively impossible) to do securely (not sure if doas has those, but it would be a feature lacking those)
[13:58:11] <No1x3r0> Bushmaster BSD is another OS or alternative to Linux, Windows, or Mac, it's not a boot loader to let you multiboot; although it may have a bootloader to let you multiboot in which case my *guess* would be all / any of them

[16:17:57] <fakuve> Hi good afternoon guys , this is completely unrelated to the channel but see if someone can light up right in here. I got this account of Gmail in which I stored so many photos back when there was no Storage Limit , so Now I cannot receive emails on it and I'm downloading the images (I started today) , the maximum download is of 500 items and you have to select them manually (so annoying) , I'm just
[16:17:59] <fakuve> downloading 2 packs of them , so around 1000 Pics at I think 15 MegaPixel tops , regular phone camera frames , how large am I expecting this downloads to be?

[16:35:31] <Badegakk> yeah
[16:35:50] <phogg> you are at the mercy of the packaging competence of whoever maintains the PPA repo
[16:35:52] <cousteau> hexnewbie: I'd argue Linus is merely pointing out that GitHub interface isn't well suited for merges, but that's a known fact.  GitHub in general (the web interface at least) isn't good for git stuff (commits, edits, etc); its forte is the project management part, but you should be using plain old git for the git stuff.  I think this is generally agreed upon.
[16:35:58] <Sauvin> I would discourage the use of that command for a number of reasons, starting with "PPA".
[16:36:51] <phogg> Using PPAs is a good way to get in trouble. Best avoided unless you know some apt kung fu.
[16:36:59] <thyriaen> cousteau, why not use plain old git ? i love it

[16:37:12] <phogg> it's usually fine until you try to upgrade to a new release, then who knows

[16:38:01] <ananke> using e-mail as means for running a large project is even worse
[16:38:08] <opal> it's got the general idea of what git "should" look like
[16:38:16] <Badegakk> Been using it for while, never had any problems with dist relseas either. But i understand your point
[16:38:19] <cousteau> thyriaen: because it's not something you can just get around by clicking colorful buttons, and people may not be familiar with it.  My personal advice is to get familiar with it; it's a powerful tool.
[16:38:20] <opal> ananke tell that to the lkml
[16:38:23] <phogg> opal: nope, but I'll take a look st it now
[16:38:43] <ananke> opal: just because it can be done, doesn't mean it's a good idea
[16:38:45] <opal> cousteau GUIs exist for git
[16:38:57] <opal> just because you dislike mail doesnt mean it isnt a good idea
[16:39:14] <ananke> opal: there is nothing redeeming about e-mail
[16:39:26] <opal> yeah your opinion is safely ignored
[16:39:29] <cousteau> Yes, and some of them might be good.  GitHub isn't a good git GUI.
[16:39:37] <opal> git has integrated email support and patchsets are easy to send over mail
[16:39:49] <opal> i'd like to have an issue tracker built around mail/nntp
[16:39:55] <opal> i need to work on that someday
[16:40:22] <phogg> why NNTP?
[16:40:30] <msiism> opal: I'd like to have e-mail 2.0 first. Can you do that for me?
[16:40:43] <opal> phogg i prefer nntp over mailing lists
[16:40:50] <cousteau> opal: git was DESIGNED with sending patches over email in mind.  Was quite mind blowing when I found out there was a command to send commits through email, and to apply them on the other side.
[16:41:05] <opal> cousteau yeah
[16:41:32] <opal> phogg theres a few reasons for that, one of them being that mailing lists require a sort of handshake to verify that an email address actually wants to subscribe
[16:41:33] <cousteau> Although I would argue that GitHub is a better platform for that sort of thing.
[16:41:43] <opal> with nntp you opt in just by subscribing to the newsgroups you want
[16:41:46] <cousteau> Or a centralized server in general.
[16:41:48] <opal> theres no risk of spam there
[16:41:50] <thyriaen> cousteau, it is nice to have a a system which works no matter how the information for it is transmitted
[16:41:53] <msiism> GitHub needs too much memory.
[16:41:54] <opal> because the newsgroup stays on the nntp servers

[16:43:41] <msiism> Yeah, but, honestly, Claws Mail is quite awful. I use it daily.
[16:43:52] <cousteau> Anyway, my experience with git GUIs is that at the end it's easier to just learn how to use the command line.  After all, you're gonna need to learn how to perform specific git actions, and once you know what those specific actions are, it doesn't matter if you have to type them or to click them
[16:43:56] <opal> it handles my millions(!) of messages fine
[16:43:58] <thyriaen> superhuman is amazing
[16:44:04] <opal> yeah it blocks on network requests but eh
[16:44:11] <ananke> also most nntp servers have a limited retention, so good luck finding messages that are older than couple of years
[16:44:14] <phogg> cousteau: they're good for some things. Reviewing history is easier in a GUI. I like them for blame, too.
[16:44:26] <opal> anyone can set up an nntp server
[16:44:27] <msiism> opal: Well, as soon as I try to have more then two accounts handled, it just gives up for me.
[16:44:27] <opal> i have two
[16:44:32] <opal> going to peer them with usenet when i have time
[16:44:33] <msiism> s/then/than
[16:44:40] <cousteau> With the difference that typing them is a universal solution that is also very well documented on the internet, whereas clicking through menus implies figuring out where they hid the menu entry
[16:44:42] <thyriaen> msiism, superhuman is an awesome mail client
[16:44:51] <opal> i have like... 4 email accounts enabled and a few nntp accounts
[16:44:56] <opal> and rss/atom feeds
[16:44:58] <opal> handles that fine
[16:45:01] <msiism> opal: Which version are you using?
[16:45:02] <cousteau> phogg: oh right.  I do use gitk a lot for reviewing history
[16:45:11] <opal> 3.17.8
[16:45:12] <msiism> thyriaen: Okay, interesting. Why is that?
[16:45:33] <msiism> opal: 3.17.3 here. Hm…
[16:45:46] <cousteau> Just not for "git actions" (modifying the repo), only for observing.
[16:45:52] <msiism> Maybe I should try Alpine.
[16:46:25] <thyriaen> msiism, it is fast, the workflow is entirely shortcut based and the goal is to reach inbox 0, where all your emails are marked "done" and disappear from your main view

[16:48:11] <phogg> therefore the most essential thing is a good threaded view, so you can understand how a new message relates to an ongoing conversation
[16:48:18] <opal> yeah
[16:48:22] <thyriaen> phogg, it groups all the mails to conversations and the search feature is blazing fast with great attributes to look through them
[16:48:39] <opal> loosely related but have you looked at notmuch for organising mail
[16:48:40] <phogg> if you never have threaded conversations the lack of a good threaded view (or presence of one) is not noticeable, but if you do it's a glaring problem
[16:48:51] <phogg> thyriaen: again, doesn't sound useful
[16:48:55] <msiism> thyriaen: So, does this thing have a website where I can read about it?
[16:48:57] <opal> i dont think ill use it personally because i depend on imap between multiple devices; notmuch isnt very suited for that
[16:49:22] <thyriaen> phogg then i don't know what you mean
[16:49:42] <opal> msiism a search engine will probably show you
[16:49:54] <thyriaen> msiism, https://superhuman.com/
[16:49:54] <phogg> thyriaen: I want *threads* not conversations. A two-dimensional view is useless. I want a curated hierarchy of categories, and I want custom filtering rules for placing email into them, and easy ways to move mail between categories.
[16:50:04] <msiism> opal: The emphasis is on probably. But let me try anyway.
[16:50:14] <opal> well too late, thyriaen already dropped a link
[16:50:14] <hexnewbie> cousteau: I guess... it's not possible to generate a sane merge metadata when you don't have your credentials and GPG keys configured, latter being impossible in a cloud service, and such. It's also surprising to look out into the real world, where I am not the only one who likes commit messages longer than ‘merge’, ‘bugfix’, ‘new code’
[16:50:36] <phogg> thyriaen: after all of that add search, but results which break the threaded context of the match are not very helpful
[16:50:46] <opal> i hate reading commit logs like that
[16:51:02] <opal> gentoo packagers are guilty of terse commits and overlay maintainers are worse
[16:51:04] <thyriaen> phogg, the categories with filtering rules is in it and works quite well - the history of all the things that person wrote is a missing feature i would say

[16:57:47] <opal> ubntu you're being incredibly vague with what you want
[16:57:54] <phogg> thyriaen: if it's *only* two people then you can simplify down to flat, absolutely. That's just not how it works in reality, though.
[16:57:56] *** Joins: Brumaire (~quassel@81-64-14-121.rev.numericable.fr)
[16:57:59] <ubntu> okay sorry let me explain further opal
[16:58:02] <Bushmaster> looks like dudes are having fruitful interactions here
[16:58:06] <msiism> opal: Superhuman seems to be "software as a service" for some $ per month.
[16:58:11] <opal> msiism oof

[16:58:17] <hexnewbie> opal: My favourite is the primary company repository has 10-20 commits that say ‘test’, ‘test commit’, ‘test’, etc. And all of a sudden there's a ‘revert test’.
[16:58:19] <phogg> thyriaen: a mail client which *allows* flat views is fine, one which *has no concept* of complex discussions is broken
[16:58:20] <opal> ubntu it'd help to have exact logs / commands of what youre doing
[16:58:23] <thyriaen> phogg, hmm - let me check the few email conversations i had with multile ppl
[16:58:35] <opal> hexnewbie ouch
[16:58:47] <cousteau> Ouch indeed
[16:58:53] <msiism> thyriaen: What are ppl?
[16:58:54] <phogg> thyriaen: to my mind there has never been a better client for this than pan (which is a news reader).
[16:59:00] <ubntu> I have a cloud service that I can start with pcloudcc, it mounts the cloud directory as a virtual drive in my /home directory and I can see all my folders. The syntax for this is pcloudcc -u my_login_email -d - I am trying to mount this drive when I boot so I don't have to do it manually everytime I log in
[16:59:08] <opal> msiism theyre little things that run around in your head and correct people on irc
[16:59:12] <hexnewbie> msiism: Parts per litre
[16:59:17] <msiism> Okay, got it.

[16:59:53] <opal> thats what i meant by exact
[16:59:54] <ubntu> ok will do one sec
[16:59:57] <hexnewbie> msiism: Also, funny enough, a substring of of "Apple II e"

[17:00:18] <opal> ubntu there's also #systemd, i think it's moved to libera

[17:00:30] <cousteau> From now on I'm reading "Apple" as "a people e"
[17:00:34] <opal> yeah just /join #systemd here
[17:01:03] <cousteau> I'll put it in the list of things I cannot unsee, like the "meow" in "homeowner"
[17:01:18] <ubntu> https://paste.debian.net/1211472/
[17:01:24] <thyriaen> phogg, i see - it organizes them in a flat order depending on the time it was sent - but isn't that also the order in which you would read it - thus making a threaded view not really helpful ( under the assumption everything is on the same topic )
[17:01:44] <phogg> thyriaen: no, you would generally read in threaded order
[17:01:47] <hexnewbie> cousteau: Let's not get started on experts-exchange and pen-island
[17:01:58] <cousteau> Lol
[17:02:10] <TJ-> ubntu: change the WantedBy=default.target and install it as a *user* service not systemd
[17:02:22] <cousteau> I remembered the former but had completely forgotten about the latter
[17:02:25] <phogg> thyriaen: if you send a message, then I reply, then opal replies to you, then opal replies to me, you might prefer to read my reply, then opal's reply to me, before reading opal's reply to you
[17:02:39] <opal> ubntu do you have an 'admin' group on your system (`grep admin /etc/group`)
[17:02:46] <sp0fp12> l
[17:02:47] <phogg> thyriaen: in fact this is usually the case: you read depth-first, otherwise it's hard to track the conversation
[17:02:52] <thyriaen> phogg, hmm i guess i don't have enough conversations like that its mostly between 2 people and seldom 4 at a max
[17:02:59] <ubntu> hm no I do not
[17:03:08] <opal> ubntu also what TJ- said, you may want to create a user service and not a system one
[17:03:16] <TJ-> ubntu: also, with a --user service, there is no need of User= or Group=

[17:04:01] <thyriaen> opal, interesting
[17:04:05] <phogg> thyriaen: the LKML is a good example of this, and this topic came up while discussing email as part of a git workflow--which is why LKML is relevant and clients which are not good for that are not
[17:04:29] <opal> i'll reiterate on what someone else said that mail is bad if you have a bad mail workflow
[17:04:39] <opal> it's great if you have a good one

[17:05:00] <opal> or check systemd's man pages
[17:05:02] <cousteau> What trees don't take into account is the fact that mails might be replying to MULTIPLE mails, or combining comments from multiple ones
[17:05:05] <thyriaen> phogg, opal yea that makes sense
[17:05:19] <opal> cousteau that's true
[17:05:21] *** Joins: codeswhite (~codeswhit@user/codeswhite)
[17:05:31] <opal> i wonder how clients handle multiple In-Reply-To headers
[17:05:34] <thyriaen> cousteau, exactly what i did here - i introduced a cycle in the "tree"
[17:05:35] <cousteau> So a tree won't do it; ideally it should be a directed acyclic graph, like the ones Git uses...
[17:05:49] <phogg> thyriaen: I will summarize it this way: if you have *simple, uncomplicated* email needs where you almost never involve more than two people in an exchange, or perhaps where emails are mostly just event messages, then you can use a simplistic, feature-light email client. If you use email for serious business those clients are awful.

[17:06:49] <TJ-> it's rather nice and predictable once you take time to immerse in it
[17:06:54] <opal> which is awful because i may take a job that requires dealing with systemd
[17:06:54] <cousteau> Sort of a "loop", but not a "directed cycle"
[17:07:01] <thyriaen> phogg, or maybe more like tasks
[17:07:05] <phogg> thyriaen: this is of course on topic https://www.jwz.org/doc/threading.html
[17:07:09] <opal> i like s6, that's nice and predictable
[17:07:19] <opal> systemd actually has a lot of gotchas if you look at it enough
[17:07:43] *** Joins: stutteringsteve (~slevin@86.106.143.60)
[17:07:44] <phogg> thyriaen: the important thing to keep firmly in mind, which is always difficult, is that email can be used for many purposes. It's hard not to sell out the corner cases while optimizing your common case.
[17:07:57] <phogg> opal: s6 fans! High five!
[17:08:01] <opal> i have some bookmarked posts criticising systemd (and not the usual anti-systemd criticisms, but valid technical issues)

[17:10:45] <thyriaen> opal, yea this it was made me crawl up the walls - i created my own s/mime cert and then i could not use it because some authority had to sign it
[17:10:52] <opal> yeah

[17:11:12] <TJ-> ubntu: this should be all you need: https://paste.debian.net/1211473/
[17:11:15] <thyriaen> opal, how does pgp work ? How do you get a cert for it and so forth ?

[17:12:21] <opal> yeah generally people meet up in person because they can 100% verify that the person is who they say it is
[17:12:43] <opal> but with pseudonymous keys being popular, of course that's less reasonable than if you're using your real name for your key

[20:47:39] <phogg> Bushmaster: consult your dictionary
[20:47:48] <ayecee> a bio or biography has a broader scope

[20:48:40] <THE_GFR|W> ok
[20:48:58] <ayecee> Bushmaster: a CV is broader than a resume but a bio is broader than even that.

[23:53:47] <codebam> I set it to TCP
[23:53:53] <msiism> Zogatribe: You should probably start a blog about all this, so we cna hear you out.
[23:53:56] <MinusOne> codebam, does your hosting provider also have a firewall/security groups?
[23:54:03] <[[R]]> danieldg: dude, hes trolling
[23:54:08] <codebam> MinusOne: yes vultr, I added the port there too
[23:54:16] <MinusOne> oh gotcha
[23:54:19] <cousteau> btw I'll be back here later when I fail miserably to do the fsck thing
[23:54:32] <Zogatribe> the solution is to deprecate Linux and start again
[23:54:37] <TJ-> codebam: if it isn't QUIC / HTTP/2 which is UDP
[23:54:39] <danieldg> [[R]]: and I'm bored

[23:54:41] <AlwaysAGuest> djfhn: unless it's some ridiculous packet crafting attack, how are they even taking control of the routers? It can only start if : a) you changed its default config to make the web interface accessible from Internet, b) with you as a home user running some virus app which then scans the network and tries to exploit more devices.
[23:54:44] <[[R]]> danieldg: rofl
[23:54:49] <[[R]]> danieldg: its like arguing with a cat
[23:54:52] <cousteau> [[R]]: danieldg is trying to actually make Zogatribe focus their effort on something productive
[23:55:07] <danieldg> [[R]]: I currently lack a cat, sadly

[23:55:15] <codebam> I don't know what it would be, probably just HTTP/1. it's the znc web interface
[23:55:20] <[[R]]> danieldg: well, if you ever get one, just remember not to argue with it
[23:55:20] <msiism> Zogatribe: And, do you have a an architectural design for that new thing?
[23:55:32] <TJ-> codebam: right, so TCP
[23:55:32] <danieldg> digital cats are good enough
[23:55:47] <TJ-> codebam: without seeing all your rules including this one hard to tell you
[23:55:47] <Zogatribe> msiism: I don't have the time to create a kernel but if I did it would be a microkernel
[23:55:49] <cousteau> [[R]]: oh and don't tell me about arguing with cats... I had an argument with a cat recently.  I lost.
[23:55:55] <AlwaysAGuest> anyway, all that security BS is just basic common sense. Don't try to scare me into auto-updating all the time on my closed LAN.
[23:56:01] <codebam> I'll dump my rules and share
[23:56:08] <[[R]]> cousteau: you alwyas will
[23:56:08] <codebam> ctrl-v just a sec /s
[23:56:26] <msiism> Zogatribe: See, can't deprecate Linux without a plan for a solid replacement. That's the problem.

[23:57:19] <codebam> my rules
[23:57:19] <msiism> djph: There is an open-source effort at re-implementing that, as far as I recall.
[23:57:24] <codebam> that's a lot shorter than I expected

[23:57:49] <Zogatribe> Torvalds himself admitted the bugfixing is getting harder due to the complexity of the Linux codebase: it is an under-engineered mess security nightmare
[23:57:49] <djph> msiism: hehe :)
[23:57:52] <codebam> wait 6502 isn't there
[23:57:59] <MinusOne> codebam, I have had issues in the past where a hosting provider randomly decided to block a port. Can you try another port?
[23:57:59] <codebam> why, I added it

[23:58:07] <digital_mystik> any recommendations for an AMD-based laptop, or is there something coming out to wait for? I've been out of the hardware game forever and was just thinking about potentially upgrading my potato
[23:58:18] <codebam> MinusOne: sure, but first I'm going to figure out why firewalld didn't add my rule
[23:58:22] <msiism> djph: It's not a joke, by the way. :)
[23:58:23] <codebam> do I need to restart it?
[23:58:25] <Zogatribe> msiism: various include Linux
[23:58:34] <msiism> How do you mean?
[23:58:39] <AlwaysAGuest> Zogatribe: kernel maintenance, security, cannibalism...that's not for people like you and me to worry about about. Leave it to Torvalds and the suits in Washington.
[23:58:44] <MinusOne> ah, I again I missed a key comment. Sorry codebam =P
[23:58:57] <cousteau> Is there a #linux-offtopic channel for general discussion?

[23:59:09] <djph> msiism: yeah.  That's why I mentioned it... but IIRC, it's always "just N years away"
[23:59:09] <msiism> It's #linux-offtopic.
[23:59:11] <cousteau> oh cool
[23:59:24] <msiism> djph: Like the Linux desktop…
[23:59:33] <AlwaysAGuest> #linux is also for off-topic, unless it's about a subject that annoys an op
[23:59:37] <cousteau> Zogatribe: maybe you should move this to #linux-offtopic and leave this channel for people who need help with linux
[23:59:43] <msiism> AlwaysAGuest: Not quite.
[23:59:44] <djph> msiism: haha, yup :)
[23:59:46] <AlwaysAGuest> this isn't just a tech support channel
[23:59:51] <codebam> well restarting it added the port, now it works
