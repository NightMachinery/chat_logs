[00:20:28] <emmeka> brainwash posting that link on this network is a sin
[00:20:32] <emmeka> please repent
[00:20:55] <brainwash> and I thought that people here like free stuff :(
[00:21:07] <emmeka> *free as in freedom
[00:21:12] <MootPoot> freedumb
[00:21:16] <emmeka> MootPoot I made a scientific discovery today, which is pretty cool
[00:21:29] <MootPoot> woah
[00:21:42] <MootPoot> emmeka for the agriculture nobel prize
[00:21:50] <emmeka> it's still weird to me that if someone asks me what I do for a living I can say "I'm a scientist" with a straight face
[00:22:05] <MootPoot> today I watched 40 videos on hand washing and patient care
[00:22:19] <MootPoot> even though I dont work in an actual healthcare facility
[00:23:13] <brainwash> why would I wash my hands? I got a clean dick
[00:23:56] <MootPoot> emmeka: scientist or field researcher
[00:23:58] <MootPoot> hmm
[00:24:03] <KatrinValerie> Good porn is hard to come by, the industry just sucks.
[00:24:42] <brainwash> then try some gay porn
[00:24:56] <KatrinValerie> emmeka: omg tell us more about it
[00:25:32] <brainwash> I thought that you were a woodworker
[00:26:54] <MootPoot> he works his wood inside his wife
[00:27:03] <emmeka> KatrinValerie it is not that noteworthy, but still neat. basically I was just compiling a lot of the data from oat trials and doing some post-harvest testing of grain and I found a couple samples from plots with oats which were hulless, but weren't supposed to be. then I worked backwards from last year's breeding lines and found out all these plots were directly beside each other.
[00:27:25] <MootPoot> speaking of
[00:27:28] <MootPoot> how's your wife doing
[00:27:34] <MootPoot> back up on her feet?
[00:28:13] <emmeka> so I surmised that somehow, a hulless trait randomly evolved/mutated/got contaminated into those breeding plots, and it's like a dominant trait, and now we have a random hulless oat seedline I've kind of discovered which appears to be pretty unique genetically
[00:28:20] <emmeka> and now I have more work to do
[00:28:22] <emmeka> but it's cool!
[00:28:40] <KatrinValerie> emmeka: that is indeed very cool
[00:28:49] <MootPoot> do they let you name it 
[00:28:51] <MootPoot> after yourself
[00:29:10] <brainwash> "Mark Zuckerberg’s net worth drops nearly $7B in just a few hours amid Facebook outages."
[00:29:25] <emmeka> MootPoot she is still off work, waiting for doctor's approval to return to work part time (the doc is being stingy about it and thinks she should be off longer), but her meds are working and she's doing much better.
[00:29:29] <MootPoot> somebody is getting fired brainwash 
[00:29:47] <MootPoot> hey, if she can stay off longer, why not 
[00:30:02] <brainwash> just turn it off and on again
[00:30:06] <MootPoot> does her work want her back part time or full time or nothing
[00:30:06] <brainwash> problem solved
[00:30:23] <emmeka> her work is willing to take her back at whatever amount of hours she can do
[00:30:27] <MootPoot> but its nice to hear she's ok
[00:30:41] <emmeka> her plan was 1 shift a week at first and see how it goes from there
[00:30:44] <MootPoot> Its a cheese factory, I doubt the cheese demand went down over the pandemic lol
[00:31:01] <emmeka> they're pretty busy there. in fact she had to go back to work a while ago to ~consult~
[00:31:09] <emmeka> because a cheese she helped developed kept having problems
[00:31:22] <MootPoot> LOL
[00:31:26] <MootPoot> cheese with problems
[00:31:29] <MootPoot> why is that funny
[00:31:51] <emmeka> as in it wasn't coming out right, it's supposed to melt really easily but wasn't

[02:33:40] <amigojapan> Hi
[02:34:15] <amigojapan> I had an idea for a very basic multiplayer real time strategy game
[02:37:03] <amigojapan> You would start with a single guy on the center of the screen, but you could multiply him into multiple guys then with the arrow keys, you could move your army of guys around and attack other armies of guys
[02:37:06] <MootPoot> I have an idea for a doujin
[02:38:58] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, could also have it so each time you clone, that clone loses half its stats so the other clone can be identical
[02:39:06] *** Quits: Cashlin (~hp@user/cashlin) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[02:39:11] <Cryowolf> so the more you clone, the weaker eaech individual clone gets
[02:39:38] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: I guess
[02:39:43] <Cryowolf> it would make sesnse
[02:39:53] *** Joins: Cashlin (~hp@user/cashlin)
[02:39:58] <Cryowolf> but it doesnt draw from any other before itself
[02:40:24] <Cryowolf> so the MC clones itself, the clone clones itself, MC stats remain unchanged after the first cloning
[02:41:15] <Cryowolf> maybe have a cap too that can be upgraded and then you can upgrade skill sharing through the clone neural network
[02:41:59] <amigojapan> Neutral network is no longer a simple idea
[02:43:08] <Cryowolf> your game, you can decide that for yourself
[02:43:16] <Cryowolf> real life doesnt have to enter into it
[02:43:21] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: I am kind of thinking of a game as simple as majo to yuusha
[02:45:24] <Cryowolf> okay, then maybe each time it clones itself, the square that it stands on gains a "home territory"
[02:45:47] <Cryowolf> and the square it lands on gains "attack territory"
[02:46:04] <MootPoot> I feel weird
[02:46:08] <amigojapan> Ok
[02:46:08] <MootPoot> kind of sick
[02:46:50] <amigojapan> Ouch MootPoot did you already start working?
[02:47:06] <Cryowolf> MootPoot, so take some anti-nausea and go rest

[02:48:46] <MootPoot> I ate something I shouldnt have
[02:49:06] <MootPoot> I had some minced beef stew
[02:49:08] <MootPoot> maybe that
[02:50:26] <Cryowolf> hmmm
[02:50:54] <Cryowolf> well since beef isn't really that bad for your stomach even if not thoroughly cooked (long as its not mixed)
[02:51:04] <Cryowolf> it had to be either old or improperly stored

[02:54:16] <MootPoot> for some reason logitech decided to make a keyboard in the last few years
[02:54:20] <MootPoot> that plugs with
[02:54:23] <MootPoot> fucking
[02:54:27] <MootPoot> usb micro b
[02:54:28] <MootPoot> wow
[02:54:49] <Cryowolf> logitech have decline in build quality and customer support
[02:54:56] <Cryowolf> while razer have done the opposite
[02:55:03] <MootPoot> really?
[02:55:04] <MootPoot> wtf
[02:55:15] <MootPoot> logtech was the bomb 
[02:55:29] <MootPoot> well, I haven't ever had a logi device fail on me...anecotal I know
[02:55:31] <amigojapan> Logitech has existed forever
[02:55:44] <Cryowolf> yes, my mouse (my own fault really, but I didnt tell them that) razer viper ultimate, had its side buttons stop working (I had it in the hospital for 2 months and it fell on the floor a lot)
[02:55:54] <MootPoot> my g600 is like 6 years old and works just fine
[02:55:58] <Cryowolf> all I had to do was a cord cut, take a picture of it
[02:56:04] <Cryowolf> and they would send a new one
[02:56:07] <Cryowolf> so I did
[02:56:11] <MootPoot> lol
[02:56:13] <Cryowolf> I didnt even have to send the old one in
[02:56:33] <Cryowolf> I only had to cut the cord going from the wireless charger/transmitter to the usb
[02:56:38] <MootPoot> I have a g600, g910, g915
[02:56:41] <Cryowolf> remove the stickers under everything
[02:56:44] <MootPoot> no complaints, never failed
[02:56:46] <Cryowolf> and cut them in half
[02:56:58] <MootPoot> only thing I dont like is the software lost its mind once
[02:57:04] <MootPoot> some bug it took them 3 months to fix
[02:57:06] <Cryowolf> razer viper ultimate has mechanical clickers afaik
[02:57:25] <Cryowolf> no "light plasticy air clicking"
[02:57:35] <Cryowolf> like where you rest your finger on it and it goes off
[02:57:47] <Cryowolf> and no double click issues with razer anymore
[02:58:05] <Cryowolf> Im actually using both mice now. The new one and the old one
[02:58:22] <Cryowolf> I can sometimes get the side buttons to work if I keep slamming it down on my thigh
[02:58:45] <Cryowolf> but its warranty is voided and it has no cord for its charger or itself
[02:58:56] <Cryowolf> so it gets to borrow my other razers one
[02:59:52] <MootPoot> aside from putting the wrong connector on
[02:59:57] <MootPoot> I dont think I'll stop buying logi
[03:00:21] <MootPoot> sure, even if they last like 20% or 40% less time then a razer ( since you do say they are build better )
[03:00:35] <MootPoot> they typically cost like 30-40% of the price
[03:01:05] <amigojapan> I bought a Logitech hand scanner back in the days when I bought my 486, this one https://images.app.goo.gl/tGkkRDVF1i5GLo6eA

[03:01:36] <amigojapan> Seems it may have been in the 80s
[03:01:51] <MootPoot> I thought my Hdd was RGB for a second
[03:02:00] <MootPoot> it was just the rgb reflection from my gpu

[03:04:46] <Cryowolf> MootPoot, others dont fit. and I dont mean wrong usb, I mean like literally dont fit into zezh hole
[03:05:04] <MootPoot> rip
[03:05:25] <Cryowolf> razer have improved over the years, logitech declined
[03:05:35] <MootPoot> idk
[03:05:47] <Cryowolf> my Logitech 700s works awesome still. My logitech 518 MX works awesome still
[03:05:48] <MootPoot> my last periphral I got was this g915 last year I think
[03:05:56] <MootPoot> works great
[03:06:04] <Cryowolf> the 518 I own is like 15 years old II think
[03:06:06] <MootPoot> my 6 year old g910 also works great
[03:06:15] <MootPoot> same with my 6 year old g600
[03:06:16] <amigojapan> Hmm guess it was 1990 when I bought the have scanner, cause I bought it with the money from my barmitzvah
[03:06:45] <Cryowolf> yeah I bought the MX518 on release in 2005
[03:06:50] <Cryowolf> so 16 years
[03:06:56] <Cryowolf> and it still works like yesterday
[03:07:45] <MootPoot> speaking of

[03:24:43] <snake> amigojapan, they are like 80 cents here

[03:26:44] <snake> amigojapan, it'd be easier to buy the 5usd one that is already prepped for me anyways
[03:26:57] <snake> hopefully i'll be earning enough that i can have some occasionally
[03:27:26] <snake> in america coffee can be $5

[03:27:47] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: sorry I don't know what that is
[03:27:50] <Cryowolf> cantaloupe is like 3-5 usd in Sweden right now, depends on se ason
[03:27:51] <snake> ofc cantaloupe is not something you would have everyday
[03:28:21] <snake> actually iirc it was not the cantaloupe that was 80 cents it must have been a bell pepper.. maybe the cantaloupe was like $2-$3

[03:29:19] <Cryowolf> the cantaloupe here depends on harvest seasons in Spain
[03:30:10] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: I see
[03:31:40] <amigojapan> In the supermarket near my house the cheap watermelon or melon is already cut up. And the expensive one is not
[03:31:44] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, for some reason in Sweden they cost between 500 and 1000 euro
[03:32:04] <Cryowolf> to find a good water melon you have to tap it
[03:32:11] <Cryowolf> knock on it
[03:32:14] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: 1000 euro wow
[03:32:23] <Cryowolf> if the echo is good, then the water melon is good
[03:32:44] <Cryowolf> you cant knock iti if it's sliced
[03:32:50] <Cryowolf> so good way to avoid people telling that
[03:32:55] <amigojapan> The cut up one is not bad
[03:33:17] <Cryowolf> you want one with an echo that sounds more hollow and travels better
[03:33:22] <Cryowolf> otherwise it isn't ripe
[03:34:26] <Cryowolf> just a tip
[03:34:31] <Cryowolf> that you maybe already knew
[03:34:35] <amigojapan> It seems watermelon in America is usually seedless, in Japan I have never seen that
[03:34:49] <Cryowolf> we have both here
[03:34:55] <Cryowolf> seedless cost more
[03:34:58] <amigojapan> I see
[03:35:34] <Cryowolf> btw wanna know a neat trick you can do with a water melon? You can make a tiny hole, big enough for a metal wire, maybe 2mms
[03:35:54] <Cryowolf> then you move it in and squish everyone and then draw it out with a silicone tube
[03:35:58] <Cryowolf> kinda just suck it out
[03:36:13] <Cryowolf> then you take the tiny piece you took off and put it back in place
[03:36:18] <Cryowolf> maybe add some food glue
[03:36:18] <MootPoot> you can do that with a human skull as well
[03:36:30] <Cryowolf> and now you have a watermelon with nothing in it
[03:36:38] <snake> amigojapan, seedless?
[03:36:43] <snake> idk there are usually white seeds
[03:36:55] <snake> which are edible
[03:36:56] <Cryowolf> people usually do this to fill it with something else
[03:37:00] <snake> err wait
[03:37:03] <snake> dude whaaaat
[03:37:04] <amigojapan> Snake here the seeds are usually black
[03:37:10] <Cryowolf> I once did it to fill it with helium

[03:37:26] <MootPoot> I see
[03:37:32] <Cryowolf> ever seen a water melon hover above the ground?
[03:37:46] <Cryowolf> it's funny
[03:38:14] <snake> amigojapan, here is a photo of what im familiar with: https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1698/1675/products/Cantaloupe_Hearts_of_Gold2.jpg?v=1557507821

[03:38:21] <snake> you scoop those out and throw them away
[03:39:13] <Cryowolf> the way to do it is to push a baloon inside it, one that can grow to its shape and not break, then you have the mouth of it and you can fill the balloon inside with helium until it compresses hard and after that, close the mouth shut, push it inside and close the water melon hole
[03:39:20] <Cryowolf> now you have a levitating watermelon
[03:39:26] <amigojapan> snake: ah ok you are talking about cantelope still. I see
[03:39:29] <groovy> snake: that looks like a canteloupe
[03:39:37] <snake> amigojapan, ohhh you switched to watermelons
[03:39:49] <snake> ok yeah black seeds in watermelons makes sense
[03:39:51] <snake> carry on
[03:39:54] <groovy> how do u guys eat mush melon
[03:40:05] <snake> cantaloupe is firm
[03:40:13] <snake> at least after you scoop out the middle
[03:40:16] <amigojapan> groovy: don't know that
[03:40:18] <snake> it is a bit of a pita to prepare
[03:40:30] <groovy> we call it mushmelon where i'm from
[03:40:45] <snake> watermelon is less of a pita to prepare but also more difficult to eat when you need to spit out the seeds
[03:40:46] <groovy> and the proper way to eat it is sliced with a pinch of salt
[03:40:51] <snake> also it can give me a tummy ache or make me tired
[03:41:31] <Cryowolf> snake, yeah but dude the fun thing about watermelons is that when you remove everything inside it and thin out the edges a bit with a wire, put a large balloon inside it and fill it with helium to the brim. Tie the end, push it inside, close the water melon up and now magical watermelon
[03:41:51] <snake> Cryowolf, !
[03:41:53] <snake> whoa dude
[03:41:57] <snake> that is fun

[03:43:24] <Cryowolf> if the outer layer of the watermelon is too thick or there is still meat stuck inside, it'll be too heavy to float

[03:43:58] <snake> worst experience ever btw, not taking the bus again
[03:44:02] <Cryowolf> so you gotta thing out the layer too and it takes awhile to get it even and a wire that is perfectly shaped to be able to spin around
[03:44:14] <Cryowolf> in Sweden all we do in thecities is take the bus
[03:44:20] <Cryowolf> but theyre usually very clean

[03:47:45] <amigojapan> Brb
[03:47:49] <Cryowolf> some of them go up to 7 or 8 an hour, some 1 an hour
[03:47:56] <snake> Cryowolf, you dont have to be so exact, just wondering maybe about your last trip or your most frequent trip
[03:47:58] <Cryowolf> and how often they go depends on the time

[14:28:58] <darkwitch> after spending multiple trillions on technology to make it happen, they are still not able or willing to show people the ads they are interested it
[14:29:42] <amigojapan> darkwitch: I made a demo for an ai program that recognizes the age and gender of the user at the computer and shows more appropriate ads for that gender and age group
[14:30:33] <emmeka> you'd think it would be fairly simple, but no
[14:31:08] <darkwitch> the ones who pay for having their ads shown bypass all such things
[14:31:08] <emmeka> never forget: Amazon is a multi-billion dollar company that sees you buy a vacuum cleaner and thinks "you know what this guy needs? more vacuum cleaners."
[14:31:38] <amigojapan> Right
[14:32:07] <emmeka> once I had a good solid few weeks where I kept getting ads for coffins. I felt like I was being threatened by the algorithm
[14:32:20] <emmeka> Zuck out there like "better buy one, buddy, you'll be needing it soon"

[14:35:06] <amigojapan> darkwitch: I just use as blockers on all my devices
[14:35:09] <darkwitch> well, not really ads either. they appear in other places, like search results
[14:35:10] <emmeka> google probably doesn't know what to make of my search history and that's why targetted ads never make sense
[14:35:28] <emmeka> not to mention I do not smartphone, which probably ruins their whole system

[14:39:00] <emmeka> I'm vaguely aware that it exists but know nothing about it, and now somehow the algorithm is convinced I must be obsessed with it for some reason

[19:34:09] <Bco1981> i guess 5
[19:34:22] <MootPoot> the 18tb is normal, no RAID

[19:35:11] <MootPoot> dosent matter
[19:35:20] <MootPoot> the data is already backed up on the 18tb unit
[19:35:25] <Bco1981> ah okay
[19:35:30] <MootPoot> and on another 18tb unit in a different pc
[19:35:38] <MootPoot> so the RAID is just the last level
[19:35:57] <Bco1981> but... then raid5 would give even more sense... more space
[19:36:18] <MootPoot> well, the data is only like 18tb max so
[19:36:28] <MootPoot> most times its 12-14
[19:36:34] <MootPoot> no more then that
[19:36:42] <MootPoot> the problem with the 8tb units is that they are SMR units

[22:52:05] <KatrinValerie> Y'all missing out on the OpenSuse experience
[22:52:25] <KatrinValerie> In all seriousness, I just roll with Debian, because that is what I setup on servers
[22:52:49] <Bco1981_2> on servers yeah, debian.
[22:57:13] <Bco1981_2> notepad and paint is on the add/remove programs list. you can uninstall notepad and paint
[22:58:54] <Poeticode> I used to run CentOS on servers so Fedora made sense for me
[23:03:37] <ButterNoodle> that new centos
[23:03:38] <ButterNoodle> ...
[23:03:52] <KatrinValerie> Poeticode: why would you do that to yourself?
[23:04:03] <KatrinValerie> It's redhat but worse
[23:04:20] <ButterNoodle> redhat is widely used in the enterprise
[23:04:40] <ButterNoodle> thankfully cloud has changed that
[23:04:43] <Bco1981_2> uninstall one drive... added danish UI language... have to sign out and login to take effect... then pops up MS teams
[23:04:50] <Bco1981_2> it wasn't there before.

[23:07:40] <Bco1981_2> KatrinValerie, this is my laptop
[23:07:52] <Bco1981> KatrinValerie: this is my desktop
[23:07:55] <Poeticode> that's just like your opinion bro
[23:07:57] <KatrinValerie> Or was it even earlier that centos started to decline
[23:08:00] <KatrinValerie> I don't remember
[23:08:13] <KatrinValerie> Poeticode: I am not your bro, buddy
[23:08:21] * ButterNoodle is still trying to remember when the decline started...
[23:08:31] <ButterNoodle> thats right.. it hasnt happened
[23:08:40] <Poeticode> nowadays it's all docker containers and k8s sadly
[23:08:46] <KatrinValerie> I wonder if the old distros are dying
[23:09:01] <KatrinValerie> didn't check in a while, are orphaned packages still a huge problem in Debian these days?
[23:09:18] <KatrinValerie> Eh, I don't really care as long as it works
[23:09:19] <ButterNoodle> you can objectively shit on a distro.. but just saying its bad is no different than saying install gentoo ya chump
[23:09:34] <Poeticode> I was gonna make a joke that debian himself orphaned his project but that would be in bad taste
[23:09:46] <ButterNoodle> I love orphans
[23:10:05] <KatrinValerie> Poeticode: Docker is a disgusting unneeded layer of complexity
[23:10:14] * ButterNoodle openes the doors to ButterNoodle's orphanage for wayward catgirls
[23:10:18] <KatrinValerie> And doesn't even claim to provide proper isolation from the host
[23:10:30] <ButterNoodle> :|
[23:10:33] <ButterNoodle> not what its there for
[23:10:51] <KatrinValerie> Idk, it's used for PaaS in production
[23:10:55] <Poeticode> infrastructure as code was the best thing that happened to the industry
[23:11:20] <KatrinValerie> Poeticode: I don't remember what that buzzword means
[23:11:32] <KatrinValerie> Heck I've been out of the IT Game for a bit too long
[23:11:35] <ButterNoodle> IaaS
[23:11:38] <Poeticode> then you're not in the industry and your opinion is irrelevant
[23:11:50] <KatrinValerie> ButterNoodle: so after PaaS they come up with IaaS
[23:11:59] <ButterNoodle> yea
[23:12:03] <ButterNoodle> *did that

[23:16:10] <Jigsy> Hitler fought in WW1, though.
[23:16:19] <duds-> ok but it's not about him

[23:18:53] <Jigsy> Kaiser loli.
[23:18:56] <Jigsy> There you go.
[23:19:19] <duds-> so sad Japan has no manga/anime with communist themes considering all their cool Marxist literature last century ;w;
[23:19:44] <Jigsy> Why would Japan have communist themes?
[23:20:07] <duds-> The Crab Cannery Ship could make for an awesome anime
[23:20:21] <HeTo> duds-: there's Arakawa under the Bridge
[23:20:52] <duds-> Jigsy, every country does to some extent in their media. Class struggle is a universal culture.
[23:20:59] <duds-> HeTo, oooh, I'll check it out!
[23:21:05] <duds-> thanks :)
[23:21:20] <Jigsy> I wouldn't say class struggle is indictive of Communism, though.
[23:22:14] <KatrinValerie> She's not the Kaiser though
[23:22:23] <KatrinValerie> She's just climbing ranks in the military
[23:22:40] <duds-> Hmm I guess it depends, Jigsy 
[23:22:57] <HeTo> there isn't class struggle in Arakawa under the Bridge, they already have a commune
[23:23:12] <KatrinValerie> Yeah, they are all homeless
[23:24:21] <duds-> HeTo, interesting!
[23:26:50] <theholyduck> i thought japan stomped pretty ruthlessly on comunism
[23:26:57] <theholyduck> during like the pre ww2 era 
[23:27:07] <theholyduck> similar to the red scare periods in the us
[23:27:29] <duds-> they didn't technically
[23:27:44] <duds-> it was stomped out ruthlessly as a political movement, but not in academia
[23:28:17] <duds-> Marxism was actually very common in the universities but it was not commonly practiced in politics
[23:28:24] <HeTo> that said, Arakawa under the Bridge is a comedy, it doesn't show communism in a bad light but it doesn't exactly promote it either
[23:28:39] <duds-> good enough for me HeTo :]

[23:29:40] <theholyduck> its one of those shows from shafts weird period 
[23:29:53] <duds-> In fact, theholyduck, one of the most studied economic books in academia was a Japanese one based in Marxism that stripped away all references to historical materialism (the most revolutionary aspect) and only dealt with economics
[23:30:37] <theholyduck> duds-:  and there were plenty of comunists in US academica also. that doesnt really change the fact the us stomped on communism pretty hard
[23:30:40] <theholyduck> and japan did aswell
[23:30:48] <duds-> of course, of course
[23:31:39] <duds-> I'm just saying the government looked the other way as long as it wasn't connected to a political movement, but it was quite popular to study.
