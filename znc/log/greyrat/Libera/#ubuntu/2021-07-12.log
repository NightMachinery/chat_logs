[09:25:53] <alkisg> Quackles: if you're on UEFI/GPT, that's possible. On BIOS/MBR, it's not. Upload the output of `sudo parted l`.
[09:26:13] <Quackles> One moment.
[09:26:17] <Quackles> That’s a vertical bar, right?
[09:27:03] <The-Fly> for modern versions of Ubuntu (20 and up), is modifying 70-persistent-net.rules still the prefered way of defining which ethernet device is eth0 ?
[09:27:05] <alkisg> sudo parted -l
[09:27:12] <alkisg> minus lowercase L
[09:27:41] <Quackles> The dual boot is actually booted into the windows half right now, but I can confirm it’s UEFI.
[09:27:43] <alkisg> The-Fly: no, persistent interface names mean you get something like enp2s0 (pci bus place)
[09:27:52] <alkisg> So that udev rules file isn't used anymore
[09:27:55] <Quackles> To be clear, a bootloader is already installed: GRUB.
[09:28:01] *** Joins: solo1_ (~solo@172.58.235.221)
[09:28:17] <Quackles> However, I had to configure it to handle the dual boot properly (with the windows bootloader subordinate to it) and I don’t particularly want to do that again.
[09:28:52] <alkisg> Quackles: the efi bootloader goes into the efi partition. That part doesn't need to be touched,
[09:28:52] <Quackles> So basically what I’d like to do is just plop a new install of Ubuntu into the existing partition.
[09:29:13] <Quackles> Indeed. Now how do I prevent the Ubuntu installer from altering the EFI partition?
[09:29:16] <The-Fly> I'm doing the grub "hack" to force my ethernet devices to be eth0, eth1, etc , GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="net.ifnames=0 biosdevname=0"
[09:29:17] <alkisg> while the /boot/grub/grub.cfg goes into the ubuntu partition, and will be updated for the new kernel etc
[09:29:32] <Quackles> ....
[09:29:37] <Quackles> it wasn’t going to be that easy, was it.
[09:29:52] <Quackles> I’m worried that if grub.cfg is altered, it’ll break the current setup.
[09:29:58] <Quackles> How will the installer alter the file?
[09:29:59] <alkisg> Quackles: which part do you want to keep, the efi bootloader, or the grub configuration, and ...why?!
[09:30:10] <Quackles> Basically, I have it set up so that the following occurs:
[09:30:14] <The-Fly> what is the "best" practices method of defining which ethernet device is which ?
[09:30:14] <alkisg> The grub.cfg file contains the kernel version, that part gets updated in every kernel update
[09:30:20] <alkisg> So it's usually not a big deal to have it updated
[09:30:26] <Quackles> [1] When I start up my computer, GRUB launches and presents me with the choice between Linux and Ubuntu.
[09:30:34] <Quackles> *Windows and Ubuntu.
[09:30:45] <Quackles> [2] If I select Windows, control is transferred to the Windows bootloader, and Windows boots.
[09:30:52] <Quackles> [3] If I select Ubuntu, Ubuntu boots.
[09:30:59] <alkisg> The-Fly: that disables predictable interface names; if you do want that (why?) then sure the persistent-net is the way to go

[09:34:28] <alkisg> The terminal commands are required for BIOS, not for UEFI

[13:09:34] <Ascavasaion> alkisg, See above. You were correct... something wrong with the repository I was using. Maybe it never had armhf sources?  I honestly do not know, but CUPS is installed. thank you for your help... your telling me that the fault was with the repositories got me to look there. thank you.
[13:10:09] <alkisg> Ascavasaion: eeeeh, do note that you put jessie while you have stretch
[13:10:28] <alkisg> This isn't an appropriate solution, it's like telling windows 7 to use the windows xp updates :D

[15:09:28] <Ganberox> I'm stuck with a blank screen on the ubuntu 20.04 welcome screen, I'm trying to reboot blindly
[15:09:56] <pasiz> hello
[15:09:59] <bob2> heh... i installed the "ugly set" now and now i can play my video file... with picture... but now no audio... go figure!
[15:10:25] <Ganberox> I don't know the GUI pattern to shut/reboot, perhaps someone knows the way to do it with shell?
[15:10:38] <TomyWork> shutdown -h now
[15:10:39] <Ganberox> I hit Ctrl+alt+del once, not sure what it did
[15:10:43] <bob2> i'm done banging my head against the wall for this day
[15:10:52] *** Parts: bob2 (~bob@193.228.193.29) ()
[15:10:59] <TomyWork> but you'd need sudo for that
[15:10:59] <Ganberox> Wouldn't shutdown -h be  written into the password field unless I do something first?
[15:11:12] <TomyWork> oh you're not logged in
[15:11:18] <Ganberox> Yup
[15:11:18] <TomyWork> well you could try sysrq
[15:11:47] <Ganberox> I do have that enabled fully yes, but I was hoping to get it done the usual way if possible
[15:12:01] <TomyWork> REIBUS is the magic word :)
[15:12:07] <TomyWork> sorry, REISUB
[15:12:31] <Ganberox> Happens sometimes if monitor's not connected/swapped, not sure why it's just the way outputs from mobo work sometimes they don't re-feed the signal if they don't detect anything
[15:12:45] <TomyWork> benq monitor?
[15:12:51] <Ganberox> Asus
[15:12:54] <TomyWork> hmm
[15:13:27] <Ganberox> I'm not sure if it's the monitor or the PC, but it can happen with any PC I've have
[15:13:50] <TomyWork> well my benq (and i hear that's a common benq problem) sometimes doesn't work until i cut power to it, flush the capacitors and restore power
[15:13:59] <TomyWork> so, try that, maybe?
[15:15:05] <Ganberox> Usually I have BIOS set up to "Continue POST until press ESC" for such an other cases, I do dual boots (technically I do boot device swapping now only) and I really don't like it when bios boots straight into automatically selected boot  device, so this option has been an absolute blessing
[15:15:22] <Ganberox> That computer that has Ubuntu, is an older one without this BIOS option
[15:16:33] <Ganberox> Otherwise I'd just hit the power  button and there be no issue (but I think the storage disks would still log the SMART "unexpected power failure" event, even tho it most is zero chance of any data corruption, I hope)
[15:16:42] <TomyWork> sounds like something you could solve using grub
[15:16:51] <TomyWork> or whatever boot manager you're using
[15:17:02] <Ganberox> I think it's the default one, I made no changes there.
[15:17:22] <TomyWork> yeah just remove the default option or set the timeout ridiculously high
[15:17:55] <Ganberox> Oh, I didn't even had the idea of looking into that, that's a great advice, thanks, I haven't explored linux so much yet as I'm only getting serious with it for the past 1-2 years (way late than I was planning)
[15:17:57] <TomyWork> I have a question of my own, btw: I'm on kubuntu 18.04, and I think NetworkManager calls the shots with regards to DNS on my system and I think it gets the DNS server from the DHCP server on my VPN. Is it possible to have all name lookups go through either that DNS server (if it matches a certain domains) or my LAN interface's DNS server (both DNS servers have fixed IPs that I could hardcode if need be)
[15:18:49] <TomyWork> i know it's possible if i install extra software, like dnsmasq, but i was wondering if it is possible without any extra software

[15:24:51] <Ganberox> Not sure if this fits the bill, but you coud look at https://diversion.ch
[15:25:27] <Ganberox> But you need specific hardware for that.
[15:26:11] <pasiz> why not dns blocking
[15:27:18] *** Joins: elstellino (~elstellin@78.30.19.16)
[15:27:21] <TomyWork> what is dns blocking
[15:28:11] <pasiz> like blacklists published that removes ads and malware
[15:28:32] <pasiz> or use some ad blocking public dns
[15:28:44] <TomyWork> that's not my aim
[15:28:58] <TomyWork> and no, i dont want to use some fishy dns
[15:29:00] <TomyWork> like, hell no
[15:29:45] <holgersson> TomyWork: You can use dnsmasq with Networkmanager (maybe it's even the default for query caching).
[15:29:45] <holgersson> TomyWork: dnsmasq in turn can configure DNS resolvers per domain, about the interface I'm not sure though.

[15:30:36] <TomyWork> holgersson, right now the nm-generated resolv.conf sends queries directly to the vpn dns
[15:31:28] <TomyWork> i.e. there is no dnsmasq
[15:32:18] <holgersson> TomyWork: OK, then you need to enable it yourself like in this example: https://www.jujens.eu/posts/en/2018/Sep/08/NetworkManager-dnsmasq/
[15:32:38] <holgersson> sure, it's only for static ad blocking, ignore that ;-)

[17:37:47] <shoobie> I am trying to install ubuntu, from usb, onto an SSD partitioned at sde that I'll dedicate entirely to ubuntu.  Currently, I have debian installed on my sde partition.  I didn't want to overwrite or format the debian partition because I want to gradually migrate necessary files and format/re-use that space later.  I also would like to be able to dual boot between ubuntu and debian until I uninstall debian.  With this given, I don't know what needs to be
[17:37:47] <shoobie> done with respects to MBRs and with respects to custom partitioning during ubuntu installation.

[20:11:30] <TomyWork> Mat1010, anyway, what you need to know about ext4 is, while files and blocks aren't checksummed (meaning there is no way to tell if they have been corrupted), the structures of the file system itself are journaled, meaning if your system doesn't shut down properly, the system will scan the disk and be able to correct errors to some degree. most distros are also set up to automatically scan every now and then.

[23:06:14] <hggdh> goddard: look at /run/reboot-required.pkgs -- this file will tell you which packages require a reboot
[23:07:14] <baldpope> I'm attempting to update perl from 5.26 to 5.32, but there doesn't seem to be a package listed - is there a diff repo I should have added to be able to upgrade perl ?
[23:07:25] <goddard> hggdh: cool to know that exists
[23:07:37] <goddard> hggdh: but it doesn't exist on my system at least currently
[23:07:43] <goddard> so i guess that GUI is wrong
[23:09:16] <sarnold> baldpope: you may be better suited to just compile it from source and install it to /opt/perl/ or something similar
[23:10:05] <hggdh> goddard: there are two files /run/reboot-required*, one is just a flag, the .pkgs one would have the list of packages forcing a reboot. I have never seen a situation where we have /run/reboot-required, but /run-reboot-required.pkgs is missing/empty
[23:11:02] <hggdh> it *could* happen, after all this is software

[23:12:48] <sarnold> baldpope: yeah, trying to replace the system perl wouldn't go great.. given the perl team's history, it probably would work better than eg replacing the system python, which always ends in tears, but still it'd be brittle compared to supplying your own perl for whatever it is that is requiring the newer version
