[01:56:14] <andyandyandy> alright, i have a slightly more complicated example. what's the preferred way to share a slightly larger code snippet?
[01:56:28] <stenno> a lot of garbage collection is implementation detail
[01:58:03] <Alexendoo> Entirely you might say, it's valid to never garbage collect anything
[01:59:30] <andyandyandy> in this example: https://codesandbox.io/s/silly-shadow-69kse is the instance created on line 16 ever collected? only once clearInterval has removed its interval?
[02:01:04] <Decker> probably will be
[02:02:01] <Decker> the only thing really holding the context is the call in the setinterval; when that is no more I don't see any other reasson it would stay around

[03:15:17] *** Quits: wolfshappen (~waff@irc.furworks.de) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[03:15:37] <PenguinMan98> I have an app that uses webrtc events. It subscribes to a number of them. These handlers fire when events happen.
[03:15:46] <PenguinMan98> So far so good
[03:16:01] <PenguinMan98> Sometimes though, after connecting a video, a videoRemoved event fires
[03:16:23] <PenguinMan98> I can't explain why, or where that comes from yet.
[03:17:40] <PenguinMan98> However, I can't trace that specific event either because I commented out all the code in that videoRemoved event and the video in the dom unloads even then.
[03:18:05] <PenguinMan98> As far as I can tell, the videoRemoved handler does not remove the video
[03:18:17] <PenguinMan98> It is removed within a tenth of a second after it fires though
[03:19:05] <PenguinMan98> Which suggests to me that there is another async process that removes it that runs after the videoRemoved handler
[03:19:25] <PenguinMan98> How can I figure out what this?

If I set the height style of the visible div to "auto", then the animation is no longer smooth: https://jsfiddle.net/7rymnxeo/7/
[03:37:40] <PenguinMan98> animations almost always work better with fixed dimensions
[03:37:48] <PenguinMan98> IMHO
[03:37:51] <silly> spuz, i don't know off hand. the only idea that comes to my mind, is to calculate the height and set it manually in the click event
[03:38:31] <silly> getComputedStyle(el).height
[03:39:10] <PenguinMan98> That's a thing? I usually use el.getBoundingClientRect
[03:39:50] <silly> or that, i forgot about it. there where differences iirc. can't remember tho

[03:43:37] <spuz> is it possible to create the same animation without setting the height css property? If I set it to auto, then the animation of the surrounding divs is no longer smooth: https://jsfiddle.net/7rymnxeo/8/

[03:48:22] <PenguinMan98> You should use getBoundingClientRect to fetch the height of the element and use javascript to do the animation based on fixed values

[04:44:18] <ThePendulum> how resource intensive could setTimeout get? I'm seeing some code that's using one setTimeout per websocket, and we can have over a thousand websockets
[04:44:54] <wroathe> setTimeout itself is pretty cheap
[04:45:05] <ThePendulum> seems like it would be cleaner to have 1 timeout that iterates over all the sockets, but yeah I'm not sure if it's a problem in particular

[10:25:06] <silly> make it so
[10:25:13] <bancroft> wait, what?
[10:25:27] <silly> or... put the code using it in the .then callback
[10:25:28] <bancroft> it's at the very top, it's litterally inside a <script> tag
[10:25:43] <paulcarroty> morning
[10:25:50] <theskillwithin> if you assign it as a variable instead of a function the return value will be assigned to the variable
[10:25:55] <EdFletcher> bancroft: wrap it in an async iife, or use .then as silly suggest
[10:26:09] <paulcarroty> top await still in draft
[10:26:23] <EdFletcher> right, hence async iife

[10:27:29] <bancroft> that seems incredibly backwards
[10:27:41] <bancroft> there's no waitgroup ?

[10:28:10] <bancroft> both those methods of writing code seem incredibly backwards
[10:28:34] <bancroft> EdFletcher: yes, completely.
[10:28:42] <silly> async/await is relatively new syntax sure for promises
[10:28:59] <paulcarroty> .then() not deprecated yet
[10:29:35] <paulcarroty> async/await is 5yo old, definitely not new

[10:33:52] <silly> i'd expect it to be true the other way around too. and .then your go becomes js
[10:35:09] <paulcarroty> it's hard 'cause js core function() should be tuned for

[10:36:32] <bancroft> paulcarroty: kubernetes is written in go. It's not going anywhere for a very long time
[10:37:54] <bancroft> can I put an async function inside of a sync function?
[10:38:20] <EdFletcher> yup, but it'll always return a promise so you'll have to .then it
[10:38:49] <bancroft> ok, trying to rewrite everything again to make this work... somehow
[10:39:08] <EdFletcher> and fwiw, i enjoy writing go very much and tend to use it for backend stuff because the deployment story is amazing, but overall javascript is just a better language
[10:39:58] <EdFletcher> bancroft: give groking a promises a go first, then you won't need to keep rewriting things because you'll understand how they work on the first pass

[10:45:08] <theskillwithin> came asking a basic js question, now you have opinion about javascript in general,  mkay
[10:45:33] <EdFletcher> bancroft: oh, boy. ok, first of all typescript is just javascript in the end, so it's kinda garbage in and of itself. second javascript is far more ergonomic than go and that is not debatable. third it's has significantly more momentum behind it than even go does (which has its own significant momentum). fourth, go comes from a place of elitism,
[10:45:33] <EdFletcher> which is... gross. again, i like the language but i'm telling you with substantial, professional experience in both: js is better.

[14:53:50] <tmm88> so, paste the script in a site like hastebin
[14:53:53] <tmm88> first of all
[14:53:56] <Rockwood> okay

[15:53:08] <tmm88> since i created this account
[15:53:22] <tmm88> but i already validated, and it's not difficult to fix this

[15:54:29] <jellobot> tmm88, ECMAScript's Array contains a number of built-in methods for iteration (e.g., map, reduce, every, some, filter, and forEach). They relieve the need for manual iteration, provide better abstraction than a `for` loop, and make it clear what your iteration is doing.

[15:56:17] <jellobot> Decker, Trying to measure the performance of X thing? It's usually not advisable to try and do so from WITHIN javascript - instead it's usually better to use an external profiler that will not change the behaviour of your code in any way. However, if you do still require an internal measure for whatever reason - use the performance API [ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance ]

[20:49:58] <cahoots> .file as opposed to .getFile1 and .getFile2
[20:50:57] <silly> the calls to .file happen one after the other b/c js is single threaded, but if it causes e.g. long running disk i/o, then this can be concurrent
[20:53:00] <cahoots> really... but then we're no longer executing one function at a time it sounds like, we're pausing one at a certain line and starting another

[20:56:40] <cahoots> the .then(...) functions are not async, nor is .file
[20:57:53] <silly> a regular function will finish, if you have e.g. fetch('url').then(...) in your sync function, then the request will be started, the outer function finishes and later the .then will execute when the network request finishes
[21:01:22] <cahoots> correct. but i'm talking about whether or not the two .file calls execute concurrently with respect to one another. since they're not async, i wouldn't think they would, and i think there'd be a potential race condition issue if they did
[21:02:15] <silly> js will start one or the other, not both at the same time

[21:03:46] <systemfault> A Promise represents an already started task
[21:05:40] <systemfault> So you can have a thousand IO "started tasks" all running in parallel by the JS VM internally... but as far as the language is concerned, your callback will still be working as if it was all single-threaded, using the event loop

[21:08:28] <nicoty> Hi. Can someone please recommend me a good pre-built JS shell/REPL project that I can use to test JS scripts? Specifically, I'm looking for something small and open source, that I could just pull from some repo, set up quickly and run offline on the browser on my mobile. Ideally it'd just be a really simple HTML webpage+script that doesn't need any build tools, i.e., I'd just need to visit the local URL to access it after cloning the repo.
[21:09:09] <nicoty> Usually I use the broswer's console when I'm on desktop to achieve the same thing, but mobile browser don't have it so...
