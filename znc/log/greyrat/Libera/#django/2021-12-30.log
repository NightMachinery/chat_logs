[00:38:30] <papa-dinkle> hi folks. I am a new CS graduate and I have done a couple small projects in Django. I love the framework and I am wondering if anyone currently employed on projects using django can give me direction on what to focus my learning and portfolio on
[00:39:53] <papa-dinkle> I am finding the job hunt a little bit overwhelming tbh and want to focus my energy appropriately
[00:40:04] <gordonjcp> papa-dinkle: find an existing that uses Django, look at its bug tracker?

[01:04:55] <LordKalma> how can I configure services in a docker-compose file so that I can use the container domain names from the host? Like, if I have some container service called `foo` I want to be able to do http://foo from the host. I've tried `network_mode: host` but that's direct "on-host", not what I want. Because I need the services to still be able to also do that with eachother

[18:53:34] <pra81> hello to all
[18:54:11] <pra81> i am new to django all i wanted to know how to get all functions in django. is there any shell in django ?
[18:55:05] <pra81> function like render ??
[19:00:25] <pra81> is this the right place to ask such questions ?
[19:03:47] <dodo> manage.py shell
[19:04:03] <pra81> dodo hello sir
[19:04:14] <pra81> dodo i have tried this one
[19:05:12] <pra81> dodo but it does not show request function when i try to use dir()
[19:10:04] <pembo13> pra81, what do you mean by "all functions"?
[19:10:20] *** Joins: Crassus (~Crassus@user/crassus)
[19:10:43] <pra81> pembo13 django contains built in functions right ? Or may be i am wrong
[19:11:49] <pra81> pembo13 like render function
[19:11:51] <pembo13> pra81, well yah, any library/framework does
[19:12:01] <pembo13> pra81, you'd want to read through the documentation
[19:12:47] <pra81> pembo13 so can you tell me where to look exactly look for the functions in docs because the docs are too vast
[19:13:18] <pembo13> pra81, that's just how it is with any large project... there isn't going to be a single page with all function
[19:13:39] <pra81> pembo13 so can i get all functions with a single command ?
[19:13:50] <pembo13> pra81, no
[19:13:57] <pra81> pembo13 ok i see
[19:14:24] <pra81> pembo13 but i want more documentation about render function . how can i get it ?
[19:14:57] <pembo13> pra81, search the docs for the render function
[19:15:14] <pra81> pembo13 that will be a good idea
[19:15:59] <pra81> pembo13 it is called as django.shortcuts i think as i can see in the docs
[19:16:52] <pembo13> pra81, i believe so

[20:03:26] <meshugga> hey, I'm using drf and in a view where I want to manually use request.data to access a nested json object, everything under request.data is flattened, i.e. {'foo': {'bar': 5}} sent by the client will show up as {'foo': 'bar'}

[20:05:39] <pembo13> meshugga, I'm not that familiar with DRF, but wat were you expecting from `request.data`?
[20:06:09] <meshugga> pembo13: the json data i sent, either parsed or not, but in any case, not mangled
[20:07:16] <pembo13> meshugga, and that's not what's in request.data that you pasted?

[22:01:53] <Mortician> instead of usr
[22:02:00] <Mortician> or just override the ones in usr
[22:02:13] <pembo13> Mortician, you'll want to google "python virtual environments"
[22:04:43] <Mortician> can you tell
[22:04:47] <Mortician> im not newb
[22:05:10] <Mortician> pick folder tell python which folder?
[22:07:16] <doismellburning> Mortician: I think you may be looking for #python - that doesn't seem like a Django question
[22:07:29] <Mortician> those ppl are even less helpful
[22:09:01] <doismellburning> Well you've come in here with a somewhat off-topic question, phrased quite broadly in a way that makes it hard to answer, and while the response you got wasn't the most charitable it could have been, your reaction wasn't either - you're not exactly encouraging people to want to help you right now
[22:10:02] <doismellburning> Your question doesn't look Django-related, but given it seems Python-related, if you elaborated a bit on what you've got, what you're trying to do, and what you're seeing instead, that would perhaps help someone help you
[22:10:36] <Mortician> yeah the person who made this container setup devpi
[22:11:11] <Mortician> then building the container the packages get unzipped into container usr/local
[22:11:14] <Mortician> ....
[22:11:25] <Mortician> and its impossible to develop this way
[22:11:38] <Mortician> and is completely uncesary
[22:11:42] <doismellburning> That seems like you should talk to the author of the container, consider using a different container, or change it
[22:12:36] <Mortician> well right
[22:12:52] <Mortician> so where do i place the files in pkgs folder
[22:13:03] <Mortician> so i can edit them on the fly
[22:13:30] <doismellburning> That sounds like a question for the author of the container, or people who understand how the container is set up, or for people who know more about devpi
[22:17:22] <Mortician> what is this venv thing
[22:17:31] <Mortician> what is it for

[22:23:02] <doismellburning> hansol: Gunicorn is a good way to run Django in production, but the fact you're asking suggests you're a bit unclear on broader topics - have you done the Django tutorial?
[22:24:38] <Mortician> i have gunicorn too
[22:24:47] <Mortician> its so simple its friken confusing
[22:25:01] <Mortician> i guess it just runs an app?
[22:25:09] <Mortician> its like a single command
[22:25:19] <Mortician> not a full web server like apache
[22:25:35] <Mortician> more like a fpm or supervisor process
[22:25:38] <doismellburning> It's a very different thing from Apache
[22:25:52] <doismellburning> (beyond an incredibly high-level view like "http server")
[22:25:58] <Mortician> u basically give it a port and an app and a log file

[22:26:40] <Mortician> these just sit idle
[22:26:58] <Mortician> what happens when a million users show up?
[22:27:01] <doismellburning> There are a lot of things you can do with Gunicorn; the Django docs provide a nice intro https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/howto/deployment/wsgi/gunicorn/
[22:27:50] <Mortician> i told this guy to use django but the fool chose flask
[22:28:07] <doismellburning> Flask is a perfectly good framework, with a different focus and style
[22:28:34] <Mortician> yeah but django is documented
[22:28:37] <Mortician> and popular
[22:28:58] <doismellburning> This is a place for Django support and discussion, not bashing other frameworks
[22:30:57] <nbjoerg> Mortician: IMO the web server should be focussing on being a web server and not an application server. apache has been getting that part wrong for decades
[22:31:16] <nbjoerg> Mortician: you might want to consider something like uwsgi's emperor mode for something like that
