[00:27:46] <maroon> The encryption method has been reversed and is a CTR like construction based on AES-128 using a single key. Multiple iterations of encryptions are chained with the keys obtained by the key derivation function used as IVs. However, it turned out after the analysis that all these modes offer only a security level of 128-bit.
[00:31:47] <maroon> so i was right, aes-ctr = stream, and they had no mac to prevent xor'ing the ciphertext

[01:46:14] <dostoyevsky2> What's the function of a salt vs an iv?  Wouldn't it be easier to just have an iv instead of both?
[01:46:59] <maroon> the salt changes the key each time the salt changes
[01:46:59] <riv> I think a salt is used in hashing, an IV as part of a cipher mode
[01:47:03] <riv> they are conceptually similar
[01:47:52] <maroon> you can also have: temp = hash(key||salt) and then use part of that as the key and part as the iv, which makes it a little hard for someone to flip the 1st block of unauthenticated CBC

[02:32:41] <MacGyver> At some point in the past it was actually different from normal cryptography, but that point is 50 years ago.
[02:33:33] <MacGyver> Good rules of thumb to teach are "run away from everything claiming military grade", "run away from everything claiming one-time pad", "run away from everything claiming information-theoretic security".
[02:33:34] <kashire> "military grade" is just marketing. Its like "space age" from the 50's/60's and "it just works".
[02:34:48] <kashire> Lets see. It was like aes-128 was the generic usage for the military and aes-256 for everything that is slightly more important.
[02:34:49] <MacGyver> *Actual* military-grade encryption is just AES.
[02:34:52] <kashire> ^
[02:36:01] <maroon> someone once posted a claim on scheier's blog, that AES-256 is used for top secret stuff, except only using some secret key schedule. but they linked to a site that doesnt exist anymore
[02:37:24] <MacGyver> Possibly using modified s-boxes?
[02:37:30] <MacGyver> Which isn't actually too far fetched.
[02:37:49] <MacGyver> There's been a bit of research into whether the s-boxes are optimal, iirc.
[02:38:43] <snappy> definitely makes things more difficult internally as well, now you can't use off the shelf software, everything has to be custom
[02:47:03] <Peng> Painful to use software AES everywhere 'cause AES-NI on standard CPUs is useless
