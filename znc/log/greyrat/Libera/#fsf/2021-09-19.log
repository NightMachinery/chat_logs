[17:07:14] <Bronzu> They are right
[17:07:35] <kompowiec2[x]> it's mess like the whole xorg

[17:08:12] <kompowiec2[x]> not mention to mir lol
[17:08:13] <akib> yeah
[17:08:43] <kompowiec2[x]> I wonder why canonical constantly lose with redhat

[17:09:17] <kompowiec2[x]> ubuntu phone...
[17:11:05] <akib> Bronzu: the suckless folks put some gnu package in their sucks list too
[17:11:18] <Bronzu> Because they suck
[17:11:21] <Bronzu> imo
[17:11:34] <Bronzu> That's why I love OpenBSD and NetBSD
[17:11:49] <Bronzu> But hey they also put Clang there
[17:12:31] <Bronzu> If you want a more insane list regarding software that sucks, check out harmful.cat-v.org/software
[17:12:44] <Bronzu> For them even NetBSD isn't good enough
[17:12:49] <Bronzu> And GNU is the antichrist
[17:12:56] <Bronzu> As well as the GPL
[17:13:15] <akib> are openbsd and freebsd free software?
[17:13:19] <Bronzu> Yes they are
[17:13:27] <Bronzu> Under a permissive license
[17:14:07] <Bronzu> Buuuuuut, RMS doesn't quite like them since you can find questionably licensed software in their ports trees
[17:14:26] <Bronzu> If you want a 100% free BSD check out HyperbolaBSD
[17:14:36] <akib> really???  they probably have non-free drivers, just like linux
[17:14:46] <Bronzu> Nope
[17:15:00] <Bronzu> They don't allow that, but nonfree firmware on the device itself is ok with them
[17:15:08] <Bronzu> The operating system itself just has to be 100% free
[17:16:31] *** Joins: panosalevr (~panosalev@fsf/emeritus/panosalevro)
[17:17:09] <akib> i was saying about openbsd and netbsd, not hyperbolabsd

[17:19:09] <iShareFreedom> about games, im a pro in quadrapassel ^^
[17:22:01] <akib> hmm, it looks like harmful.cat-v.org sucks
[17:22:15] <Bronzu> So akib, to summarize. The OS has free drivers, but it also has non-free firmware blobs for (I think some) drivers
[17:22:23] <Bronzu> Oh cat-v is controversial
[17:22:37] <Bronzu> It's very much cult like towards an ideal of absolute minimalism

[17:23:19] <Bronzu> "Firmware source code is available under a mix of BSD and GPLv2 licences."
[17:23:45] <Bronzu> So there is free firmware available for a turly 100% free OpenBSD system. (Like the one I have)
[17:24:02] <Bronzu> It just doesn't hold your hand and you have to ensure yourself that it stays free.
[17:24:49] <kompowiec2[x]> So the same situation like slackware

[17:25:05] <Bronzu> Exactly
[17:25:15] <Bronzu> slackware is very much BSD like
[17:25:17] <Bronzu> It's really cool
[17:25:30] <kompowiec2[x]> Even init are portable
[17:25:38] <joepublic> So to summarize, "are openbsd and freebsd free software?" --> "Not entirely, no."
[17:25:43] <kompowiec2[x]> I love RC
[17:26:06] <Bronzu> joepublic, that's a bit different actually from "Not entirely no."
[17:26:09] <Bronzu> It's more like
[17:26:40] *** Quits: kryptografos (~kryptogra@104.244.75.198) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[17:26:49] <Bronzu> The OS is 100% free, the firmware for some devices isn't but it's optional. You can have devices which use 100% free firmware if you want.
[17:27:13] <Bronzu> It's just that no one will hold your hand and you have to ensure it yourself.
[17:27:51] <Bronzu> I wish that people would give these OS' more of a chance since they are really nice.
[17:28:07] <Bronzu> And you can't tell me it won't run! NetBSD exists B)
[17:29:32] <akib> yes, they are awesome os.  i will probably try hyperbolabsd someday
[17:29:35] <joepublic> "FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD all include instructions for obtaining nonfree programs in their ports system. In addition, their kernels include nonfree firmware blobs."  -- https://www.gnu.org/distros/common-distros.html
[17:29:52] <akib> i hate them
[17:30:03] <Bronzu> That is true. That's why the FSF doesn't really like them, they aren't as pure as some would like them to be
[17:30:14] <akib> i mean non-free programs
[17:30:17] <joepublic> Thus, to summarize, "are openbsd and freebsd free software?" --> "Not entirely, no."
[17:30:21] <Bronzu> But if I can make 100% free, then that's good enough for me.
[17:30:37] <joepublic> Same for me, except that I use Debian.
[17:30:51] <Bronzu> Oh cool, you just don't have the non-free repo right?
[17:31:06] <joepublic> Yes, just debian main.
[17:31:11] <Bronzu> Nice :)
[17:31:17] <akib> will the hurd ever be stable enough to use
[17:31:32] <joepublic> I use an old nvidia video card supported by the nouveau drivers with no loading of firmware.
[17:31:40] <Bronzu> Every time this question is asked the release is delayed by 2 years. akib lol
[17:32:05] <joepublic> Hurd development is progressing pretty slowly, aiui
[17:32:29] <Bronzu> joepublic, I just a have a Thinkpad X61 (with a modified BIOS to get rid of the wifi card whitelist and to allow SATA2 speeds), so everything works nicely.
[17:32:41] <Bronzu> Unfortunately it doesn't have libreboot capability
[17:32:47] <Bronzu> But my T400 sure does ;)
[17:33:26] <akib> what is the wifi card whitelist???
[17:33:49] <Bronzu> A lot of thinkpads have a special list that dissalows for unauthorized wifi cards to be installed
[17:33:52] <Bronzu> It's horrible really
[17:33:56] <joepublic> the wifi card whitelist is a bit of evil in the bios of many laptops, allowing only certain wifi cards to be installed otherwise the computer will not boot
[17:34:05] <Bronzu> But many BIOSes have been modified unoficially.
[17:34:33] <joepublic> I have also heard of hacking your favorite wifi card to change the pci id to something on the whitelist.

[21:18:37] <Bronzu> KE0VVT, you don't need ThinkPenguin! Check out ath9k compatible devices.
[21:18:43] <Bronzu> They either have free or lack of firmware
[21:19:03] <Bronzu> If you look for devices with compatible chipsets, you might find something more powerfull
[21:19:48] *** Joins: trekkie1701c (~trekkie17@user/trekkie1701c)
[21:19:50] <Bronzu> Also, ath9k devices support 802.11n standard. Which is pretty fast.
[21:19:58] <Bronzu> And the fastest standard available on OpenBSD
[21:19:58] <jxself> The ThinkPenguin one is ath9_htc which is not the same as ath9k.
[21:20:02] <chap> h-node should clarify the state of the firmware, If it says state: unkown I am willing to accept that but it only mentions the "free driver used:" 
[21:20:04] <Bronzu> That is true
[21:20:17] <Bronzu> But I find them similar enough to group them together
[21:21:04] <jxself> ath9k_htc is external USB. The other is internal, Mini PCI Express.
[21:21:15] <chap> I didn't know about openfwwf it should be mentioned when appropriate
[21:21:25] <Bronzu> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open-source_wireless_drivers
[21:21:31] <Bronzu> Wikipedia has a comparison page
[21:22:07] <jxself> The lack of encryption means you still won't be able to use the device in a lot of cases though.
[21:22:35] <jxself> I'd not want to run an open WiFi just for the sake of that. I'd rather replace the WiFi with something else that still works with free software.

[21:24:38] <Bronzu> Really helps when looking for new hardware
[21:24:56] <KE0VVT> Bronzu: But why is it so slow? My ThinkPad X200 has an Atheros chipset, and it is just fine.
[21:25:43] <KE0VVT> My uncle's USB adaptor is extremely slow, and he can barely get pages to load.
[21:25:48] <Bronzu> Is it? There may be many factors. But for me it worked just fine, until I moved... Now my network connection is very unstable, but besides that it works fine everywhere I go.
[21:25:55] <jxself> But a different chipset.
[21:25:58] <Bronzu> KE0VVT, that's weird...
[21:26:38] <Bronzu> Well as jxself points out ath9k != ath9_htc
[21:26:44] <Bronzu> That may be your problem...
[21:27:04] <KE0VVT> But the USB is always recommended when your internal Wi-Fi card does not work.
[21:27:21] <joepublic> not for performance, I don't think

[21:28:39] <Bronzu> Try out a different device maybe?
[21:28:43] <Bronzu> With an external antena
[21:28:50] <Bronzu> https://www.amazon.com/review/R3HESD2M5Y0SF0/
[21:29:00] <jxself> Is this the tiny little version?
[21:29:01] <Bronzu> This TP-Link should get better reception
[21:29:20] <KE0VVT> jxself: Yes.
[21:29:59] <jxself> Yes, the tiny antenna could be a problem. One difference is there's a much larger antenna hiding inside the computer case for the Mini PCI Express card to use.
[21:30:26] <Bronzu> For example, thinkpads use a set of wires inside the screen.
[21:30:39] <jxself> https://ryf.fsf.org/products/TPE-N150USBL
[21:30:42] <Bronzu> That way you have 2 or even 3 antena
[21:31:14] <Bronzu> You can also check the TPLink device a linked to, it should also be ok
[21:31:32] <jxself> Do things get better if he goes and sits right next to the base station? That could be an indicator.
[21:31:45] <Bronzu> Yes
[21:32:12] <jxself> That would be good to try before changing hardware to make sure it really is that.
[21:32:15] <Bronzu> The closer you are to the transmitter the better stability you'll have
[21:32:23] <KE0VVT> jxself: Sitting right next to the router did little.

[22:52:55] <Noisytoot> kreyren[m], Google stadia is proprietary malware
[22:53:34] <kreyren[m]> Noisytoot: Give me abstract to game streaming and i deploy it on hetzner, kreyren@fsfe.org
[22:54:00] <kreyren[m]> ... and integrate it in my OS and package manager once it's out of alpha
[22:55:49] <Noisytoot> but why stream games?
[22:56:09] <Noisytoot> you could do something like X forwarding over SSH
[22:56:31] <kreyren[m]> because my DAMNED system ate FIVE GPUs in a year
[22:56:45] <kreyren[m]> including AMD Vega 56, GTX 970, AMD7870 and AMD480
[22:56:56] <kreyren[m]> FIVEEEEEE!!!
[22:57:15] <kreyren[m]> Noisytoot: that has delay no?
[22:57:30] <kreyren[m]> i want to get as close to server ping as possible
[22:57:37] <kreyren[m]> well at least from my experience in gitpod
[22:57:39] <Noisytoot> yes, but stadia also has delay
[22:57:51] <kreyren[m]> yes 1ms
[22:57:57] <kreyren[m]> not even that apparently
[22:57:59] <kreyren[m]> bcs packets and data
[22:58:49] <kreyren[m]> and my delay is 37ms to Stadia server atm which is playable for non-esport 
[22:59:51] <kreyren[m]> hmm seems to be just a video stream that sends the inputs remotely ð¤
[22:59:57] <kreyren[m]> that might not be difficult to integrate
