[20:42:29] <jrm> It looks there is a problem building the Emacs interface against the Emacs main branch.  The problem started in the last ~2 weeks.  http://pkg.ftfl.ca/data/12amd64-default/2021-12-04_12h41m25s/logs/errors/notmuch-emacs_devel-0.34.1_1.log
[20:47:05] <jrm> We build Emacs packages around the 1st and 15th day of each month.  This notmuch-emacs breakage started after the emacs-devel package, which tracks the Emacs master branch, was updated on Dec. 1.
[20:47:11] <bremner> seems to be a consistent problem with "Unknown button-type `help-function'"
[20:48:42] <jrm> Oh, did I miss an existing bug report (or relevant scrollback)?
[20:48:55] <bremner> no, I don't think so.
[20:49:06] <bremner> but maybe it's a general problem with emacs 29?
[20:49:30] <jrm> Let me check if other elisp packages are having issues.

[20:55:39] <jrm> Not seeing anything similar failures in any other elisp package that build against the same emacs-devel.
[21:15:38] <bremner> hmm. OK, probably best to write a quick note to the notmuch-list
[21:22:44] <bremner> The only google hits I have are FreeBSD specific, fwiw
[21:23:15] <jrm> Will do.  Hopefully that's b/c we are so proactive with updating emacs-devel.
[21:23:34] <bremner> could be.
[21:29:03] <bremner> are there any freebsd specific patches to the notmuch-emacs code?
