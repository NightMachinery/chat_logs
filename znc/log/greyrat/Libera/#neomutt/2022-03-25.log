[13:48:00] <flatcap> morning all
[14:10:09] <gahr> hi flatcap , up early!
[14:10:37] <flatcap> hi gahr 
[14:11:02] <flatcap> yeah, ****ing builders cutting up paving slabs
[14:12:13] <gahr> must be the same ****ers who are building a new house just in front of mine
[14:12:31] <flatcap> :-)
[14:13:30] <gahr> why is show-log-messages in OpPager?
[14:13:40] <gahr> isn't it enough to have it in OpGeneric?
[14:14:56] *** Joins: plastico (~plastico@neomutt/plastico)
[14:15:28] <flatcap> no, that's a bit a odd (and I need to investigate the details)...
[14:15:58] <gahr> (it works if I remove it, though)
[14:16:09] <flatcap> the OpGeneric functions are filtered out of OpPager
[14:16:50] <flatcap> https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/blob/master/keymap.c#L719
[14:17:29] <flatcap> oh?  does it?
[14:17:48] <Kinnison> flatcap: this week there's been a film crew nearby where I work, building stuff and exploding it, doing car chases, machine gun scenes, allsorts of noise
[14:17:51] <flatcap> I tested with `bind generic <f5> show-log-messages`
[14:17:59] <gahr> ah now wait, I removed it from the index
[14:18:06] <flatcap> it worked everywhere but the pager
[14:18:43] <flatcap> Kinnison: wow!  is that as fun as it sounds?   do you know what film?
[14:19:13] <Kinnison> It's horrific.  Noisy, not being permitted to go to get lunch, etc.  It's some disney+ thing (overheard some people talking) and there's been sightings of Eddie Izzard
[14:20:03] *** Joins: nyah (~nyah@05453449.skybroadband.com)

[14:21:19] <flatcap> ah, ok.  does the 'M' binding still work without it?
[14:21:22] * flatcap tries
[14:22:31] <gahr> "bind index,pager M show-log-messages " works
[14:22:54] <gahr> I wonder why we don't fallback to the generic bindings for the pager
[14:22:59] <gahr> and the editor
[14:23:05] <gahr> (the editor, I can imagine...)
[14:23:22] <gahr> you probably don't want every second key-press to trigger whatever action
[14:25:47] <flatcap> ok, the index does still bind 'M' without a specific OP_SLM
[14:26:41] <kushal> flatcap, gahr Kinnison hello :)
[14:26:58] * Kinnison watches the world shrink a bit once more :D Hi Kushal!

[14:34:32] <flatcap> how are you?
[14:34:46] <gahr> hi kushal 
[14:35:09] * kushal is getting "Introduction to Swedish culture" session today :)
[14:35:45] <flatcap> hehe.  so many jokes spring to mind
[14:35:50] <kushal> Almost settled here. 
[14:35:54] <kushal> flatcap, hehe
[14:38:05] <flatcap> bork bork bork
[14:38:56] <kushal> I just now saw image
[14:39:38] <flatcap> I heard once, that in Sweden, The Muppets' Swedish Chef is Norwegian (and it's just as funny to them :-)
[14:39:54] <kushal> haha
[14:40:10] <gahr> flatcap: I think you can remove error-history from Index too
[14:41:58] <flatcap> ah, yes
[14:43:45] <flatcap> done
[14:49:56] <kushal> flatcap, btw, on my fedora 35: https://share.riseup.net/#2x1YEjkxS97GsowxVrK2ig 
[14:52:29] <gahr> flatcap: do you think we should remove pager from that exception from falling back to generic?
[14:52:30] <flatcap> oh, those are functions that have moved.  clearing out everything and re-running ./configure should help
[14:53:03] <flatcap> gahr: yes, but I don't (yet) know what side-effects that'll have
[14:53:15] <flatcap> feel free to investigate :-)
[14:53:56] <apo> flatcap: "In Sweden, the Swedish Chef's name was translated as Svenske kocken, meaning the "Swedish cook"."
[14:54:02] <apo> "In the German-dubbed version of The Muppet Show, the Chef is Danish rather than Swedish, and his name is Smørrebrød Skagerrak"
[14:54:18] <flatcap> thanks, apo :-)
[14:54:20] <apo> (and no, Swedes apparently don't like him. What a surprise. :p)
[14:54:32] <flatcap> oh, shame :-)
[14:58:54] <gahr> flatcap: yeah I might look at bit into it while working on my branch
[14:59:23] <flatcap> thanks.  how's that going?
[15:01:08] <flatcap> kushal: did that work?
[15:01:18] <gahr> flatcap: I was wondering what to do next :)
[15:01:31] <gahr> I tried turning op into a struct but that was an epic fail, so I reverted
[15:01:34] <gahr> might try again :)
[15:01:54] <gahr> I sometimes need to try to implement things a couple times before they work
[15:02:11] <flatcap> hehe, me too
[15:02:36] <gahr> btw, do you use vim-searchhi ?
[15:03:03] <kushal> flatcap, doing again 
[15:03:11] <flatcap> ok
[15:03:14] <flatcap> gahr: no. what's that?
[15:03:21] <kushal> flatcap, worked :)
[15:03:53] <gahr> so when you search and have hlsearch on, it's sometimes difficult to figure which match you're on
[15:03:55] <flatcap> kushal: great.  we're doing a lot of refactoring, so files and functions keep moving
[15:04:05] <gahr> the plugin makes it easier, also it has key bindings to clear the highlights
[15:04:14] <flatcap> oh nice
[15:04:15] <gahr> but recently I was hit by https://github.com/qxxxb/vim-searchhi/issues/19
[15:04:39] <gahr> and since you're vim level kungfu, I thought I'd ask :)
[15:05:47] <flatcap> I usually have nohls (except when needed), but I've mapped Ctrl-L to both refresh and turn off visual hints like hls, cursorline, etc
[15:06:58] <flatcap> hmm... that's a nice plugin.  I'll give it a try
[15:09:07] <gahr> how do you turn off hls without turning off hls?
[15:09:15] <gahr> I mean, how do you clear them?
[15:09:30] <flatcap> it turns it off
[15:10:00] <gahr> ah
[15:10:12] <gahr> I always have hls on :)
[15:10:26] <flatcap> https://github.com/flatcap/dot-vim/blob/main/defmap.vim#L106-L108

[18:17:56] <mfiano> What color group are the [-- ... --] markers in the body under?
[18:18:11] <mfiano> CHanging the entire body leaves them intact
[18:19:03] <gahr> attachment
[18:20:38] <mfiano> Thanks. I'm loving neomutt so far :)
[18:20:51] <gahr> good to hear! Thanks!
[18:20:58] <mfiano> I ran into one assertion error so far
[18:22:42] <mfiano> You can't have use_threads=yes and sort=threads in the config or it errors upon startup. Is this a known bug?
[18:25:25] *** Quits: weirdsmiley (~weirdsmil@103.25.231.102) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[18:33:08] <gahr> that'd be a mix of old and new config :)
[18:33:13] <gahr> we neeeded to change that to fix threading mode
[18:33:54] <gahr> see https://neomutt.org/feature/use-threads
[18:34:04] *** Joins: strajder (~strajder@user/strajder)
[18:34:51] <mfiano> Hmm I'm not understanding
[18:39:17] <mfiano> Ah, I see sort=threads is legacy. What I'm trying to achieve is to sort everything in my inbox, threads or not, by date, and within a thread, sort them by date.
[18:41:09] <eblake> mfiano: yes, it's a known bug that the config errors on startup (I still haven't spent time trying to fix it, since the workaround is simple - don't mix old- and new-style configs)...
[18:41:50] <eblake> do you want threads sorted by most-recent activity, but within a thread sorted by date?
[18:41:59] <eblake> and do you want the most-recent thread on top or on bottom
[18:43:08] <mfiano> So I want conversations in my inbox to be sorted in ascending order by date, and withi each branch of a thread, in the same fashion. That is, I don't want to destroy the hierarchical structure of the thread, but each branch should be sorted independently.
[18:43:46] <eblake> sounds like use_threads=yes sort=date sort_aux=date
[18:43:58] <eblake> which list threads in the order they were started
[18:44:11] <eblake> or use_threads_yes sort=last-date sort_aux=date
[18:44:21] <eblake> which lists threads in the order of most-recent activity
[18:44:45] <mfiano> I see. The first sounds like what I want. Thanks a lot.
[18:45:39] <eblake> the idea is that use_threads=yes turns on thread view; at which point sort= then says how to sort threads, and sort_aux= says how to sort within a thread
[18:46:59] <eblake> sort=date says sort the thread by the date of the first message in the thread, sort=last-date says sink the thread with newest activity to the bottom, sort=reverse-last-date says elevate the thread with newest activity to the top
[18:47:32] <eblake> but most people like sort_aux=date once use_threads=yes (that is, sorting subthreads by anything other than date order gets weird)
[18:48:00] <eblake> and sort_aux=date is the default
[18:48:53] <mfiano> and if not a thread, and strict_threads is on, messages will still sort before and after a threaded conversation by their date, right?
[18:50:08] <eblake> there's also an open bug #3070 to add in compatibility shims to mutt's sort (neomutt implemented use_threads=yes prior to mutt implementing sort_thread_groups=last-date)
[18:50:08] <neo-bot> Issue by @ebblake "implement $sort_thread_groups for mutt compatibility": https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues/3070
[18:51:26] <eblake> an unthreaded message is treated the same as a thread with one message
[18:51:33] <mfiano> Ok yeah, this is what I want.
[18:51:55] <eblake> if use_threads=yes, all threads (including threads of just one message) are sorted by the criteria of sort=
[18:52:37] *** Joins: inak (~justme@228-134-237-24.gci.net)
[18:52:40] <mfiano> I was using sort_re before, but I'm using strict_threads now. It was very unintuitive because a pebcak copied a message to the same mailbox, and deleting a message seemed to have no effect.
[18:52:57] <mfiano> But I understand what is happening in that regard now
[18:53:13] <eblake> sort_aux= breaks ties. All messages in the same thread tie for sort= (they sort to the same place because they are the same thread), so sort_aux=date then breaks the tie in date order
[18:54:55] <mfiano> Side note: neomutt.vim doesn't detect the use_threads syntax.
[18:57:25] <gahr> yeah I think we're lagging a bit
[18:57:30] <gahr> wrt the vim syntax file
[18:58:07] <gahr> we should write a script to generate it :)
[18:59:03] <mfiano> If you both are devs, let me thank you for bringing this MUA up to modern standards with some of the best documentation I've seen (and any other devs/contributors here).
[19:00:26] <mfiano> I found one documentation issue so far that I haven't filed yet: The manpage mentions net_inc in a few places, but net_inc itself is not listed as an option.
[19:00:27] <eblake> I'm not the maintainer, just a drive-by developer that scratched my own itch, and then lurks to see who else had the same itch ;)
[19:00:50] <eblake> the real accolades go to @flatcap
[19:02:56] <gahr> net_inc is valid
[19:03:02] <gahr> don't we have a doc entry for it?
[19:03:25] <gahr> https://neomutt.org/guide/reference.html#3-245-%C2%A0net_inc
[19:04:26] <gahr> ah, not in the manual
[19:04:45] <gahr> mh..
[19:13:19] <mfiano> How can I bind <home> and <end> in the command line editor to move to the beginning/end? Currently it exits out of what I am typing and tries to do a reverse sort
[19:14:03] <mfiano> `bind editor <Home> noop` doesn't seem to have an effect even.
[19:14:35] * flatcap wakes up
[19:14:44] * flatcap takes bow :-)
[19:14:52] <mfiano> Heya flatcap :)
[19:14:58] <flatcap> hi mfiano 
[19:15:15] <mfiano> New user here. Still trying to get the hang of things as you can see, but I'm very impressed.
[19:15:27] <flatcap> glad you like it :-)
[19:15:46] <flatcap> Ideas welcome: #3322
[19:15:48] <neo-bot> 🔧 discussion by @flatcap "Post-Release Ideas" with 7 comments: https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/discussions/3322
[19:15:55] <mfiano> Trying to rebind editor cursor navigation keys now, like readline
[19:16:06] <mfiano> But nothing seems to work.
[19:16:31] <flatcap> ah, I see.  I haven't tried it myself
[19:17:13] <mfiano> The above noop binding retains the same behavior of prompting for a "rev-sort"
[19:17:19] <flatcap> the vim syntax file is a scary beast (from a guy who LOVES vim)
[19:17:47] <flatcap> it's on my list to update, but it's slow work
[19:17:49] <gahr> flatcap: I think we have some screwup ongoing with MAKEDOC_FULL
[19:18:26] * flatcap reads the backlog...
[19:18:30] * flatcap looks for $net_inc...
[19:19:05] <gahr> yeah
[19:19:06] <gahr> USE_SOCKET
[19:19:19] <flatcap> oh!
[19:19:35] <flatcap> there are some magic defines in doc/make_doc.[ch]
[19:19:39] <gahr> https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/blob/master/auto.def#L400
[19:19:41] <gahr> should be here
[19:19:45] <flatcap> to make sure that *everything* gets included
[19:20:14] <gahr> yes, I understand MAKEDOC_FULL is there to make sure we also document stuff we don't compile in
[19:20:20] <phoebos> flatcap: just had a segfault when doing sidebar-toggle-visible in the pager, looks like a null dereference in pager/display.c:181, will try to reproduce
[19:21:21] <flatcap> phoebos: thanks.  would you be able to rebuild with ASAN enabled?  https://neomutt.org/dev/analysis/asan
[19:21:45] <flatcap> (that's the gold-standard for crash-reporting)
[19:21:58] <flatcap> it's one library install and ./configure --asan
[19:23:16] <flatcap> gahr: net_inc IS in the manual, but the link you gave pushed it slightly off the top of the screen
[19:23:52] <gahr> uh?
[19:24:07] <gahr> ah sure, in the docs
[19:24:09] <gahr> not in the man page
[19:24:25] <gahr> unless you build with MAKEDOC_FULL
[19:24:42] <gahr> let me say that better: I think you produce the website docs with MAKEDOC_FULL
[19:24:58] <flatcap> yes
[19:25:00] <gahr> there are defines that are always there, like USE_POP
[19:25:16] <gahr> there are some doc entries, like net_inc, which are guarded by USE_SOCKET
[19:25:29] <gahr> but we don't define USE_SOCKET in auto.def where we define USE_POP
[19:25:36] <phoebos> flatcap: sure, looks like i need to rebuild my compiler though
[19:27:52] <flatcap> gahr: oh!
[19:28:56] <gahr> (perhaps we should finally get rid of those useless defines)
[19:29:27] <flatcap> yes
[19:29:29] <gahr> mfiano: great catch, about net_inc
[19:29:48] *** Joins: rgrinberg (~textual@fixed-186-96-26-198.totalplay.net)
[19:29:51] <gahr> flatcap: do you want me to kill them with fire?
[19:30:36] <gahr> or should I add USE_SOCKET to the list for now?
[19:31:11] <flatcap> hmm...  they're useful *markers* for now
[19:31:13] <mfiano> gahr: I literally read the whole manpage this morning with my coffee :)
[19:31:32] <flatcap> let me have a quick look how many there are and how widespread
[19:33:30] <flatcap> urgh! USE_NNTP 157, USE_IMAP 99
[19:33:51] <flatcap> just add USE_SOCKET for now, please
[19:34:12] *** Quits: rgrinberg (~textual@fixed-186-96-26-198.totalplay.net) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[19:35:24] <flatcap> eblake: the last time I saw you, you had a problem with macros that <push>d index functions.  is that still a problem?  do you have a reproducer?
[19:36:22] <eblake> yes, still a problem; no, I haven't whittled down to a reproducer
[19:37:07] <flatcap> ok.  I'm planning a release in a week (though that may slip to 2)
[19:37:39] <flatcap> so please hurry :-)
[19:38:14] <eblake> if I have pager view open when I try to execute <sidebar-open>, then frequently I get the garbage command line;
[19:38:33] <eblake> if I hit 'q' to leave pager view into just index view before <sidebar-open>, then things work
[19:39:08] <eblake> so right now, I've (unfortunately) trained myself to never switch folders while the pager is open, rather than trying to get to the root cause
[19:39:45] <flatcap> ok, there's a known issue with changing folders whilst the pager is open -- that's my current focus
[19:40:13] <eblake> but just now, I did <sidebar-open> while in the pager, and see Open mailbox: ollapse-all><exit><vfolder-window-backward><last-entry><half-up>
[19:40:34] <eblake> ^G gets me back to the first unread message in the new folder,
[19:40:53] <flatcap> ah, that's the sort of thing I remember you mentioning
[19:41:07] <flatcap> that's coming from your folder-hook?
[19:41:52] <eblake> and it looks like I have '<' bound to vfolder-window-backward in index mode,
[19:42:10] <eblake> and '<' bound to a macro for '<exit><vfolder-window-backward>' in pager mode
[19:42:32] <flatcap> ok
[19:42:59] <eblake> then I also have: folder-hook . 'push <collapse-all><last-entry><half-up>'
[19:43:47] <eblake> so the folder hook is attempting to push <collapse-all>', but because '<' differs between bind index < vfolder-window-backward
[19:44:00] <eblake> macro pager < '<exit><vfolder-window-backward>'
[19:44:38] <eblake> that may explain the confusion why <sidebar-open> gets confused, tries to change the folder date, then tries a literal 'c' bound to <change-folder>, but only when I use it from pager mode
[19:45:09] <flatcap> yeah, I sort of see what's going on
[19:46:32] <flatcap> but I'll need a basic config example (I don't have the time to randomly experiment)
[19:46:43] <flatcap> if I can reproduce it, then I can fix it
[19:56:13] *** Joins: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn)
[19:56:16] <mfiano> I suppose it's not possible to color only the <email@address> parts in the header like you can with body text? The same regex seems to affect the whole line containing the email, unlike how it does in the body.

[20:09:38] <flatcap> thanks
[20:09:40] <gahr> you don't want a PR right?
[20:10:21] <flatcap> nah
[20:10:35] <mfiano> Hmm the regex engine doesn't seem to handle non-greedy look-around. Getting syntax errors in what most other parsers would handle.
[20:11:20] <mfiano> Trying to match just the header labels. "Subject:" instead of "Subject: Re:"
[20:14:25] <flatcap> what are you trying?
[20:15:32] <mfiano> ".+(?=:)" among various other things
[20:17:58] <flatcap> color header fg bg "^[^:]+:"
[20:18:06] <flatcap> works well for me
[20:19:25] <flatcap> your regex is too advanced for me :-)
[20:19:53] <mfiano> Try it in regex101.com
[20:20:08] <mfiano> It returns 2 matches, but mutt's is greedy
[20:21:20] <mfiano> Well yours works :)
[20:22:11] <flatcap> good :-)
[20:23:15] <flatcap> the website says there's only one match for your regex
[20:24:11] <flatcap> the leading '.' is matching anything as long as there's a ':' at the end
[20:24:36] <flatcap> anyway, site bookmarked
[20:27:01] <mfiano> Sorry I meant .+?(?=:)
[20:27:21] <mfiano> Anyway yeah I'm horrible at regex too

[20:37:31] <gahr> is ".+?" different than ".*" ?

[20:39:47] <flatcap> .* matches zero or more chars (as many as possible)
[20:40:43] <gahr> makes sense

[20:49:18] <flatcap> gahr: thanks, I'll have a think
[20:50:00] <flatcap> it may be two weeks, I'm still struggling with the display issues (and ultimately, the index/pager split)
[20:51:55] <mfiano> gahr: $folder_format, $query_format, $sidebar_format, and $status_format have their alignment all messed up, unlike the other *_format variables like $attach_format, $compose_format, etc

[21:02:40] <mfiano> I'll leave it to the pros. I can file an issue in a bit if someone doesn't want to brave it now.
[21:02:57] <gahr> we generate the man page from comments in the C source
[21:03:03] <gahr> yeah, we're *that* weird.
[21:03:10] <mfiano> :)
[21:03:13] <flatcap> if some work but not others, check for any unescaped magic chars in docs/config.c
[21:03:33] <gahr> we have double .dd in those lines

[21:03:58] <flatcap> hmm... that _might_ be an empty table cell
[21:04:33] <flatcap> yeah, a mostly empty column
[21:04:46] <gahr> yeah some have an asterisk
[21:04:54] <gahr> * = can be optionally printed if nonzero
[21:05:00] <gahr> this messes up the man page
[21:05:28] <flatcap> ah
[21:07:09] <gahr> we can pepend (*) in the smae column I guess, or add it at the end of the description
[21:07:26] <gahr> too bad, the HTML is nice :)
[21:09:16] <flatcap> yeah, it gets a bit messy for sidebar_format, which has two separate note chars
[21:09:44] <gahr> yeah
[21:09:48] <flatcap> is there a groff &nbsp; ?
