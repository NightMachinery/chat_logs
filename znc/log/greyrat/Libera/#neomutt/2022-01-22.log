[01:41:56] <swl> I'm trying to color emails that are unread or signed, but I can't figure out how to make it work. I'm trying 'color index_flags yellow default ~N' but I just see black and white. My config is here: https://0x0.st/oojf.txt (other file sourced is https://0x0.st/oojO.txt)
[01:59:59] *** Quits: strajder (~strajder@user/strajder) (Quit: leaving)
[02:13:16] <flatcap> swl: hi.  the index_flags refers a one column of the index
[02:13:23] <flatcap> plain "index" is what you want
[02:14:06] <flatcap> color index yellow default "~N | ~g"
[02:14:15] <flatcap> means new OR signed
[02:15:25] * flatcap checks
[02:15:50] <flatcap> index_flags will colour just the %Z part

[14:26:53] <flatcap> morning all
[14:35:13] <dcpurton> morning flatcap 
[14:37:48] <flatcap> hi dcpurton 
[14:38:33] <flatcap> I'll have a look at your PRs after cornflakes :-)
[14:39:40] <dcpurton> haha
[14:39:50] <dcpurton> no rush
[14:40:05] <dcpurton> I don't have time to do any more on them tonight
[14:40:33] <flatcap> ok, thanks :-)
[14:41:40] *** Joins: Pali (~pali@user/pali)
[14:55:54] <flatcap> dcpurton: if you're still around, please can you cut'n'paste your content-id question into a new *discussion* -- I think you should have privs now
[14:57:56] <dcpurton> can can
[14:58:20] <flatcap> thanks
[15:11:37] <gour> morning/noon everyone
[15:12:08] * gour is configuring i3 on his spare machine preparing to migrate the desktop as well
[15:12:47] <captainepoch> Morning!
[15:12:54] <flatcap> hi gour 
[15:12:56] <flatcap> hi captainepoch 
[15:14:07] * flatcap must try out some other windows managers some day
[15:14:55] <captainepoch> I'm a XFCE user
[15:15:01] <captainepoch> I've been using it for a very long time
[15:15:14] <captainepoch> You shouldn't change your WM if you feel comfortable with it
[15:16:03] <flatcap> I use gnome, but I fullscreen everything I'm using so I don't really notice the wm
[15:17:23] <bookworm> there's tiling WMs and the rest is a nightmare to use ;)
[15:17:48] <dcpurton> agreed
[15:18:02] <gour> i'm on xfce as well, but whenever i do fresh-install i re-configure keybindings to mimic i3. now my family members are already accustomed to it and considering i like tiling wm and do not use much of the DE, better to simplify my setup
[15:18:57] <flatcap> I'm generally on my laptop, so I don't want to share space.  I have a lot of desktops, instead
[15:18:59] <dcpurton> I use Awesome, but one day I'll need to move to something else when Wayland takes over the world
[15:20:58] <gour> dcpurton: yeah, that's the reason why i won't go with sway...(too) many (proprietary) apps which i need (zoom, anydesk, viber,...) still have problems
[15:23:07] <bookworm> that's the point with tiling, everything already starts out at maximum size and then shrinks only where needed
[15:23:38] <bookworm> I barely ever touch resizing functionality during normal use
[15:24:10] <gour> any light DM you can recommend?
[15:24:15] <flatcap> dcpurton: (with the exception of a content-id overhaul), is #3197 finished as well?
[15:24:15] <neo-bot> PR by @dcpurton "Add support for composing 'multipart/related' emails": https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/pull/3197
[15:26:19] <dcpurton> I feel like neo-bot is a little behind…
[15:27:18] <flatcap> sorry?  behind how?
[15:28:54] <dcpurton> that PR was new a while ago
[15:29:13] <bookworm> that was based on flats query
[15:29:23] <bookworm> any #$num triggers the bot
[15:29:46] <bookworm> it's not a "new PR" webhook bot
[15:29:48] <dcpurton> ooo. So when I mentioned it in the Discussion?
[15:30:00] <bookworm> #3197
[15:30:00] <neo-bot> PR by @dcpurton "Add support for composing 'multipart/related' emails": https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/pull/3197
[15:30:04] <bookworm> that
[15:30:08] <dcpurton> ooo
[15:30:17] <dcpurton> I see
[15:30:55] <dcpurton> flatcap: yes it's finished
[15:30:59] <flatcap> great, thanks
[15:31:21] <dcpurton> But would be good to have clarity on content-if before merging
[15:31:41] <flatcap> ok
[15:31:42] <dcpurton> if you want it merged sooner. Maybe take my last option in the Discussion
[15:31:55] <dcpurton> and I'll take out the code that automatically generates an ID
[15:32:23] <flatcap> it's ok, it can wait 'til we decide on CIDs
[15:32:40] <dcpurton> \me nods
[15:32:45] * dcpurton 
[15:32:49] <dcpurton> hmph
[15:33:27] <flatcap> bookworm: I had a play with the GraphQL API Explorer last night: https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/overview/explorer
[15:33:50] <flatcap> wow!  it's pretty amazing
[16:16:47] <flatcap> https://github.com/neomutt/test-graphql

[16:27:43] <bookworm> yeah I've a similar thing locally, although I pulled in a specific library for graphql. Would you prefer it if I just used requests and did the rest manually?
[16:28:07] *** Quits: noex (~null@user/noex) (Quit: :q!)
[16:29:28] <bookworm> graphql allows for variables so I'd favor those over string formatting
[16:29:52] <flatcap> as long as it's a commonly available library, that's fine
[16:30:10] <flatcap> yeah, ignore the python.  that's just hacked together by a python newbie :-)

[16:30:36] <flatcap> I'm just learning about graphql variables :-)
[16:31:24] <flatcap> I managed to get a "commit" query working, so we could potentially support #abcd1234 too :-)
[16:31:55] <flatcap> feel free to add to / improve test-graphql

[16:47:21] <bookworm> the first one on the graphql homepage under python client libs
[16:48:06] <bookworm> although I don't find the UX fantastic yet
[16:49:13] <flatcap> ah yes, I see a package for that
[16:50:01] <bookworm> the transport layer is configurable, so for that simple case probably requests
[16:50:43] <bookworm> the auth dance still needs to be handled manually which is a bit lacking in my view
