[01:07:48] <rcf> Franciman: if modesetting works for you, use it, one less thing to install.

[01:08:36] <backes> electrohead: probably, but I don't know how to debug that
[01:08:41] <electrohead> what's the GPU in question?

[11:51:31] <utkarshsingh> Hi!
[11:52:24] <utkarshsingh> I'm trying to dual boot Windows 10 and Arch Linux, due to un-synchronised clock, I'm not able to update packages.
[11:52:41] <utkarshsingh> Is there something I can do?
[11:54:06] <Halian> utkarshsingh: are you unable to manually change the date and time?
[11:54:27] <Halian> Windows setting the system clock to local time a long-running thorn in the side of dual-booters :(

[11:54:50] <Halian> In the long term, you may wish to enable a registry setting called RealTimeIsUniversal, though it functioning well is sadly not universal. Search that name for more information.

[16:11:28] <vicecea> thrice: yes exactly, the arrow won't appear for me, similarly reordering tabs doesn't work anymore, instead on releasing mouse button when trying to reorder tabs always puts the tab into a new window
[16:11:48] <vicecea> fairly weird, might have something to do with my config I guess
[16:12:16] <vicecea> peculiar thing is that it seems to work fine in firefox/thunar etc.

[16:49:50] <BrainDamage> can you eg startx manually with a single program?
[16:50:08] <LimeGolem> Yes; that's what I currently do.
[16:50:33] <Namarrgon> if you manually restart the service after login, does it start up?
[16:51:42] <LimeGolem> I haven't tried that. If I do, and it does, what does that mean?
