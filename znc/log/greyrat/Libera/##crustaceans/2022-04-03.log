[00:01:03] <gwozniak> I hate buying hardware now.  It's all gaming goofery
[00:01:21] <river> ugh
[00:01:37] <gwozniak> I bought the guts of a new system a couple years ago and I hope I don't have to buy anything again for a long time
[00:01:40] <river> my mouse is 24/7 glowing fading between colors
[00:01:44] <river> why......
[00:01:50] <river> its a good mouse but i dont need it to light up :/
[00:05:02] <kronk> because we treat hardware companies like professional wrestlers.
[00:05:12] <kronk> and the dumb general populace that got into building PCs laps it up.
[00:05:21] <kronk> something something eternal september.

[00:34:17] <defect> for mice i just got the logitech mx master 3 and i quite like it. no dumb gamer light shows and pretty straight forward
[00:34:31] <defect> bluetooth though, which might be a show stopper for some
[00:35:18] <defect> also a little too light. kinda want a bit more heft, but that's a personal opinion
[00:38:48] <river> i tried the mx master!~ but i didn't like it
[00:38:51] <river> i cant remember why
[00:39:29] <river> i think maybe the schollwheel was weird
[00:39:34] <river> scrollwheel*
[00:40:22] <kronk> gwozniak: how's the performance on that little box you linked.
[00:41:01] <kronk> do you leave it running often?
[00:42:32] <gwozniak> I leave it running most of the time.  I don't use the data on there much, to be honest.  I'm moving to putting my media on it, but I'm lazy in that regard. I have had one of them for about 7 years and the other for about 5.  No issues.
[00:42:53] <gwozniak> Bear in mind they are just drive bays connected via USB
[00:43:04] <gwozniak> I hope I linked to the right thing...
[00:43:29] <gwozniak> I occasionally clean them out as they get filled with cat hair
[00:43:32] <defect> river: yeah, scrollwheel is a little weird, but i got used to it pretty quickly. now i kinda like it
[00:44:32] <kronk> yeah, I started looking at "LET'S BUILD A PC!" but in reality, I just want a modular drive array.
[00:44:42] <kronk> that I can just plug and unplug from.
[00:44:51] <kronk> and I can hook a rpi or a NUC to it.
[00:45:16] <gwozniak> I have added drives to them.  I have not removed or replaced a drive yet
[00:45:42] <river> wait gwozniak
[00:45:46] <river> im not sure what this is
[00:45:47] <gwozniak> It's not physically difficult to remove them, I have found (I did take them out to clean them once or twice)
[00:46:12] <kronk> mm.
[00:46:21] <epilys> kronk, you need a sata bus and that's at least a motherboard or a pci slot on a motherboard for a sata controller
[00:46:25] <river> https://i.redd.it/aw4vhlzzfyq81.jpg
[00:46:28] <gwozniak> river: it's just a "dumb" drive bay
[00:46:46] <kronk> epilys: not if it's USB.
[00:47:08] <kronk> the "dumb" drive bay approach means I can attach whatever active solution I want to it.
[00:47:39] <kronk> just throw ZFS across the drives.
[00:48:05] <gwozniak> That's precisely what I've done
[00:49:02] <kronk> I want it as a staging area for data. like, I literally just need a giant fuck-off pool of storage to manipulate.
[00:49:31] <kronk> I'm going to offload whatever I can to Backblaze and S3 et. al. anyway.
[00:49:45] <gwozniak> That's all it is for me: a big data store
[00:49:45] <kronk> so I just need something that won't eat drives.
[00:50:12] <epilys> nuc?
[00:50:34] <gwozniak> USB isn't the fastest transfer speed, but for playing media it's just fine
[00:51:00] <kronk> yeah I have the time.
[00:51:16] <kronk> like, throw a raspi or a laptop to do the dirty work.
[00:51:33] <gwozniak> I also looked into NUCs and saw no need to get one when all I need is storage
[00:51:36] <kronk> I'm slowly planning my new office setup and I'm trying to be far more modular than I have in the past.
[00:52:02] <kronk> a laptop, a steam deck, three monitors, mechanical keyboard, docking setup, storage array.
[00:52:09] <kronk> done.
[00:52:17] <kronk> everything else is superfluous.
[00:52:29] <kronk> anything can be connected to anything else.
[00:53:16] <gwozniak> I've set it up to access these drives with NFS before (they are attached to my home server), but I went to sshfs instead because my wife never used it as a backup
[00:53:33] <gwozniak> Which is why I'm reorganizing it (again)

[01:03:11] <kronk> hm. how's the cooling on this thing..
[01:03:59] <gwozniak> Hard for me to say.  I don't push it very much.
[01:04:15] <kronk> well, I just don't want my drives to overheat.
[01:06:02] <gwozniak> I can say that the airflow seems decent when I put my hands on the front vents and the fan at the back
[01:07:03] <gwozniak> Other than that, I don't have much experience with it.  It's not been an issue, but it's a very weak claim on my part.  It mostly sits idle for me

[20:49:33] <kronk> higher titles don't mean you're a wizard. higher titles mean you've been around long enough and immersed in the business that the company does to make decisions that are vaguely technical.
[20:49:44] <kronk> you turn into an advisor and write a lot.
[20:50:12] <epilys> kronk, yeah but i'm worried they'll dump a lot to me tomorrow (first day) because all the previous engineers left before I was hired.
[20:50:50] <kronk> then be open and honest about it. you have a finite throughput.
[20:51:07] <kronk> being a senior engineer doesn't exactly change that. you're still the same person.
[20:51:35] <epilys> yeah that's my plan. I was just not expecting to see a "Senior" on my job title.
[20:51:49] <kronk> does it come with a fat paycheck?

[20:58:03] <gwozniak> Job titles basically mean nothing, in all honesty
[20:58:10] <kronk> they really don't.
[20:58:18] <kronk> all that matters is the mONEYYYYYY.
[20:58:59] <gwozniak> Truth be told, I didn't even know what my title was for the first 3.5 years of my employment with my current employer
[20:59:17] <kronk> I'm 3 titles below where I should be.
[20:59:32] <kronk> to the point where nobody knows what to promote me to.
[21:00:04] <kronk> so I just said "let's use the progression of SysDev -> SDE -> L6 Promo -> L7 Promo" and they just went with it.
[21:21:49] <gwozniak> Watched Midsommar last night.  Totally my kind of movie, but I can see it being difficult for some.  Not for the faint of heart.

[22:38:57] <river> that seems hard to believe..
[22:39:01] <gwozniak> Seems that way
[22:39:06] <river> cant they just find out on google or whatever
[22:46:13] <kronk> sure. chinese citizens can also find out about the tianamen massacre via google.
[22:46:42] <kronk> *tiananmen.
[23:01:08] <epilys> someone has to tell them in the first place
[23:03:51] <river> i find it suspicious
[23:05:25] <gwozniak> It is suspicious, but it also seems true that Russian troops were digging ditches in contaminated soil around Chernobyl, and have since given up the location back to the Ukranians
[23:06:20] <gwozniak> I would not be surprised to hear that Chernobyl is not talked about in Russia all that much and so the impetus to even look it up would be minimal
