[01:27:26] <emanuele6> !faq ref
[01:27:26] <greybot> https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/006 -- How can I use variable variables (indirect variables, pointers, references) or associative arrays?
[01:27:32] <greycat> sathylias: https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashProgramming#Functions
[01:27:37] <emanuele6> but if you need something like that, you should not use bash.
[01:27:43] <greycat> !faq return a string > also
[01:27:43] <greybot> also: https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/084 -- How do I return a string (or large number, or negative number) from a function?  "return" only lets me give a number from 0 to 255.
[01:28:07] <sathylias> emanuele6: I don't, was just wondering, thanks !
[01:28:09] <neshpion> i use `local -n var=$1` sometimes
[01:28:32] <emanuele6> what if var is $1?
[01:28:49] <emanuele6> ( what if $1 is var? )
[01:29:03] <greycat> emanuele6: I cover that stuff on BashProgramming
[01:29:19] <neshpion> then the outer `var` gets manipulated, doesn't it?
[01:29:39] <emanuele6> neshpion: no, because you set var to local
[01:30:03] <neshpion> :O
[01:30:14] <emanuele6> a solution is to use  [[ $1 = var ]] || local -n var=$1  which is probably what greycat was referring to
[01:30:20] <neshpion> luckily bash gives me "circular name reference" errors
[01:30:28] <emanuele6> but that only solves the problem if you use one local variable
[01:30:52] <neshpion> also luckily i am smart enough to name my references something more assuredly local
[01:30:52] <emanuele6> if your function only uses var as local variable
[01:31:51] <emanuele6> if you also have   local i   and you receive "i" as $1, it will not work
[01:31:53] <neshpion> e.g. https://termbin.com/b3odx  where _da_ident is a combination of username:password and i want to set _da_ident_username and _da_ident_password, for example

[01:36:58] <neshpion> arg1 might be a filename
[01:37:29] <emanuele6> but why -e?
[01:37:32] <wiscii> from man(1) sh [this is dash] it says: $((expression)) ... The expression is treated as if it were in double-quotes, except that a double-quote inside the expression is not treated specially.

[01:38:16] <emanuele6> wiscii: ...
[01:38:26] <neshpion> emanuele6: presumably the user (me) is smart enough to know that the argument that eventually gets passed to this function is meant to be either 1) username:password string or 2) a filename containing username\npassword
[01:38:30] <emanuele6> >  $((expression)) ... expression
[01:38:35] <neshpion> this is also specified in the --help
[01:38:51] <emanuele6> neshpion: but there is a test to check that a path is a regular file.
[01:39:00] <Earnestly> wiscii: It's not talking about the quotes around $(( )), but around the expression inside
[01:39:02] <neshpion> it might be a pipe or a character special, also

[02:55:38] <neshpion> i have a similar script, but i just run mpv in foreground and notify on failure with `mpv "$url" || notify-send fail`
[02:56:03] <greycat> wiscii: the people who say you need to quote ${#foo} will also say you need to quote $$ and $!
[02:56:15] <emg> wiscii: when in doubt, quote. sure it may be slightly more verbose than necessary but you're much much much more likely to run into problems not quoting than quoting
[02:56:23] <wiscii> greycat: ok .. gotcha :)

[02:57:18] <mcint> I'm having trouble with a custom pager. I wrote a script that handles calling with default options that some methods of invoking don't let me include, but the script is hanging(?) in normal usage. It just evals, or now execs, into the pager, and only fails to work via the script.

[03:02:46] <emg> so you want it to be exactly the same as running bat but add a -p first?

[03:08:40] <greybot> https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/088 -- How can I avoid losing any history lines?
[03:09:03] <thomasross[m]> I have both of those set to 1 million and 2 million respectively. maybe bash is getting started without loading my .bashrc and truncating on exit?
[03:09:27] <geirha> likely, yes
[03:09:41] <geirha> perhaps you forget to source .bashrc in .bash_profile
[03:10:23] <geirha> though there's a simple remedy for that; set HISTFILE along with the *SIZE variables. E.g.  HISTFILE=~/.bash_history.$HOSTNAME
[03:10:43] <mcint> thomasross[m]: I write http://ix.io/3Odn in a separate file. Each session writes to it's own. Easy enough to source separately later. Less risk of overwrite
[03:11:04] <geirha> so if bash gets started with --norc, or if bash is otherwise started interactively, but doesn't source .bashrc, it will truncate the default ~/.bash_history instead
[03:11:15] <bn_work> hi, bash 4.4, I have a for *.zip loop that runs unzip on multiple files, how do I break out of remaining extractions if one fo them generates an error?  I would have thought `break $?` but when I do so, it just keep executing the rest of the loop.  Do I need to invert the value to a positive value or specify n > 2 for it to exit both the current iteration and loop completely?

[05:21:37] <greycat> Create a file in your home directory that contains two lines: source ~/.bashrc and cd /wherever/you/want.  Configure your terminal to launch bash --rcfile ~/yournewfile
[05:22:17] <greycat> (Which probably means configuring your window manager to run your terminal with specific -e or -x options.)

[05:26:08] <oscurochu> i cant just use .bashrc?
[05:26:25] <greycat> That would cause EVERY shell instance to cd /there and you don't want that.  That's dumb.
[05:26:51] <oscurochu> why would that be dumb?
[05:27:19] <oscurochu> im on osx, idk how to make the terminal run custom commands...
[05:27:28] <greycat> Because it's a new location.  You don't want "bash" (invoked as a command) run from some other directory to switch directories on you.
[05:28:07] <greycat> What is the purpose of this setup anyway?
[05:28:32] <greycat> Are you trying to move your home directory to a different location but you don't know how, and you thought *this* would be good enough?
[05:28:40] <oscurochu> what i do want is for a bash script to check what the cwd is, and if its /User/some-specific-user/**/**/**/somewhere-deep to automatically point to  /User/me/**/**/**/somewhere-deep
[05:28:48] <greycat> ... this is making zero sense.

[05:31:11] <wiscii> i have a question about shellcheck, i hope it's ok to ask, it's sort of on topic ..i'll just ask
[05:31:41] <wiscii> shellcheck appears to take the first argument in a list of conflicting arguments as wrote
[05:31:58] <wiscii> i am more accustomed to the last option "winning" the game
[05:32:03] <wiscii> example:
[05:32:06] <greycat> what command are you talking about?
[05:32:40] <wiscii> shellcheck -e 2086 -o 2086 myscript, the -e 2086 "wins"

[05:33:11] *** Quits: thiras (~thiras@user/thiras) (Quit: Leaving)
[05:33:31] <larryv> -o doesn't do what you seem to think it does
[05:33:38] <wiscii> is that just a peculiarity of shellcheck or am i wrong to expect the later to win ?
[05:33:49] <ormaaj> Best behavior is usually to just fail on mutually exclusive options unless there's an actual reason to give one precedence over the other. I don't know shellcheck options so can't say.
[05:33:58] <wiscii> larryv: ok, i'm double checking but what do you mean ?
[05:34:37] <greycat> Looking at https://manpages.debian.org/bullseye-backports/shellcheck/shellcheck.1.en.html it looks like the opposite of -e (--exclude) is -i (--include), NOT -o.

[07:08:33] <greycat> Each line of the here-document ends with a newline.  Those newlines are kept in the resulting data stream.  No Carriage Returns are ever added.

(a good example would be ~/.ssh/authorized_keys if it does not end in a newline and you add a public key to it ... the previous 'last line' key won't work, and neither does the new one)

[17:22:13] <Earnestly> With posix sh, it'd be a case statement with multiple patterns
[17:23:07] <chilversc> luckily I do not need to worry about posix
[17:23:43] <Earnestly> Instead you worry about behaviour chance across bash versions
[17:23:47] <Earnestly> chance/change
[17:23:51] <tirnanog> specifically, if you need to support bash <4.2 then you must enable the extglob option.
[17:24:00] <chilversc> though the list of patterns is supposed to be a user input, so I'm tempted to have them specify a simpler syntax and transform it to ?(/*), as that seems a little awkward
[17:24:13] <chilversc> ah, I control the bash version as well :)

[17:25:45] <chilversc> I assume there isn't a useful function that will escape any wildcards in a string, so that I can pre-process this list once at the start and store it in an array?
[17:26:28] <Earnestly> They're known as globs and you can read about them (on linux with manpages) in glob(7)
[17:26:54] <tirnanog> probably best just to use a loop rather than try to be clever about it, chilversc.
[17:27:02] <Earnestly> chilversc: Consider using python or some programming language instead if these are your needs
[17:27:24] <tirnanog> it would be simple enough to write a function that short-circuits for its parameters.
[17:27:30] *** Quits: mpagano (~quassel@gentoo/developer/mpagano) (Quit: Quitting)
[17:27:47] <chilversc> tirnanog: I'll be looping over this multiple times, so my thought was pre-process the inputs to convert; /foo/bar/* -> /foo/bar?(/*), but other formats such as /foo/bar/ -> /foo/bar for exact matches
[17:28:20] <tirnanog> or just write a function that loops and tests against "$word"?(/*)
[17:28:39] <chilversc> tirnanog: but if a user specifies /foo/bar that should be an exact match only
[17:29:30] * Earnestly .oO(case $path in */) ... ;; */*) ... ;; ...; esac)
[17:30:39] <Earnestly> rsync does this, it's not a nice UI.  Doesn't follow standard path_resolution(7), nicer to have flags
[17:30:50] <chilversc> effectively I have a list of patterns (supplied by user), and a list of paths (queried from remote system), and I'm matching the two
[17:30:56] <tirnanog> in any case, I don't recommend composing patterns. there's no quotemeta in bash.

[17:32:36] <tirnanog> yes. each element becomes a word.
[17:32:36] <Earnestly> But globs won't be honoured
[17:33:05] <Earnestly> I remember writing code like this, it always becomes a mess
[17:33:19] <tirnanog> one can compose globs for [[ but it's a risky business, of course.

[17:36:53] <chilversc> yeah, this is awkward because some users would be power users and understand bash globs, others it might be confusing and there's no simple single documentation page I can point them to
[17:37:20] <Earnestly> It's one of those cases where the evaluation is done in the wrong place, logically want to implement DSL, but need for DSL is a lot of effort for what is probably just bad design
[17:38:03] <Earnestly> iow, shell should not have to reinterpret shell
[17:38:26] <Earnestly> But its programming language thinking, where this is quite normal
[17:39:33] <Earnestly> When I fixed such things myself, globs would be evaluated before my code touches it.  With remotes, this was often done with sshfs type systems, so glob expansion can be done by user and not my script

[17:42:52] <tirnanog> another issue with the notion is that bash coerces extglob for == to begin with. I'd wager it it was accidental, originally, but it's documented to behave this way at this point.
[17:42:58] <chilversc> Earnestly: I don't have that luxury here, as this is a start up script for a VM, so the list of patterns to include come from a config, and then need to be matched against a query from to a remote system
[17:43:26] <chilversc> tirnanog: what's the correct operator supposed to be?
[17:43:59] <tirnanog> = and == are the same. that's not what I meant. rather, you can't effectively disable extglob where using it.

[18:06:58] <chilversc> rather than a loop, if I'm using a regex I'd pipe the file names through sed or grep and write the results to a file first
[18:07:33] <osse> chilversc: you can abuse git check-ignore by creating an empty dummy repo and writing a .gitignore :P That way you can support whatever syntax it supports
[18:07:35] <tirnanog> I wouldn't.
[18:08:24] <chilversc> what about find -regex? you can also set the flavour of regex with -regextype
[18:08:25] <tirnanog> well, it could be OK with GNU grep -z and xargs -0 but I'm not sure it's any less laboured at that point. certainly less portable.

[18:08:52] <tirnanog> sure, there are various approaches afforded by a GNU userspace.
[18:08:57] <Earnestly> You can't use pipe with filenames unless you're going to use \0 to separate, as only valid character available to use

[18:17:57] <adac> Is there  way to start a timer inside a bash script, that kills the bash script at some point? It is probably a weird thing I know

[18:18:12] <Earnestly> yes
[18:18:31] <Earnestly> But solve your problem with other means instead
[18:19:09] <chilversc> bah, the number of times when switching from other languages I get my return codes back to front
[18:19:16] <Earnestly> Such as program that runs your script which manages time, not script itself
[18:20:58] <chilversc> there's a GUN timeout command that I've used for that exact purpose, can customize the signal as well if you want to allow your script graceful termination

[18:22:15] <wiscii> jelly, emanuele6: thanks

[19:55:04] <The_Blode> Less ok
[19:56:18] <Soliton> might want to run shellcheck on that.
[19:57:38] <The_Blode> Because I don't have the list populated in this loop, perhaps a limit might be appropriate?
[19:57:53] <The_Blode> Say limit of 20 so the terminal can display them
[19:58:17] <The_Blode> Or maybe store the loops values in a variable then use less
[19:58:40] <The_Blode> I would like to probably use an array here but not familiar with arrays in Bash

[20:00:15] <The_Blode> Yes
[20:00:48] <The_Blode> The script will iterate over folders and subfolders. It will prepend a number next to each one and the user can pick a folder with it's corresponding number.

[20:27:55] <The_Blode> I can run it in a true Bash shell

[20:28:35] <Soliton> if you don't run it with bash it's not a bash script. a busybox script might work with bash as well, sure.
