[00:54:57] <re101-donkey-30> I created this RegEx to to try to bring in this string.  December 21, 2022 - December 2023.  It doesnt seem to be including this format.  IT gives me all instances of dates whether it is this format or not.  Is there a way to force it so that it has this format with a hyphen optional but it has to be consecutive so that it doenst bring in all
[00:54:57] <re101-donkey-30> dates from the contract.
[00:55:30] <re101-donkey-30> Here is what I attempted.

[06:47:51] <digitok> which language are you using?
[06:48:04] <re101-quail-95> python
[06:48:32] <digitok> do you say "first 11" because there could be more, but you only want 11? or you just want all of them
[06:48:46] <re101-quail-95> I only want 11
[06:49:08] <digitok> like this? https://regex101.com/r/ypDoK6/2
[06:49:13] <digitok> see "group 1" on the right

[06:53:00] <digitok> we recommend the first tutorial link
[06:53:06] <digitok> * means 0 or more, so 0 or more spaces
[06:53:10] <re101-quail-95> thank you very much digitok
[06:53:17] <digitok> you could use 3 literal spaces "   " like you had

[06:54:13] <digitok> yw :)
[06:54:56] <digitok> check the "quick reference" page for a list of most features
[06:55:30] <digitok> and then you can check the specific categories for more detailed info and a table that shows which languages support those features
[06:55:45] <digitok> (you can select 2 languages from the dropdowns to be shown on the table)
[06:55:52] <digitok> good for comparing features
[06:58:05] <re101-quail-95> by specific categories what do you mean?
[06:58:55] <digitok> such as "quantifiers" on the left
[06:59:12] <digitok> you will see * listed there
[06:59:32] <digitok> with a description, example, and 2 columns showing support for your select languages
[06:59:36] <re101-quail-95> got you
[06:59:42] <re101-quail-95> at the table of contents, on the left
[06:59:57] <digitok> yep
[07:01:25] <digitok> the table also has links to each feature's relevant tutorial page
[07:01:42] <digitok> that reference is a great resource

[15:35:36] <re101-donkey-30> It has to be specifically tha string. Not all dates. Just the December 21, 2022 - December 2023.  Ignore the January 21, 2023

[15:36:32] <re101-donkey-30> since this is a hand keyed field. I am afraid that someone can miss a space. Is there anyway to tell it that the spaces are optional in between the hyphen?

[17:50:07] <re101-donkey-30> Just for my knowledge.
[17:50:49] <mysticspiral[m]> \s is used in this example which matches any whitespace character
[17:51:31] <re101-donkey-30> Thanks!
[17:51:50] <mysticspiral[m]> \n is newline, \r is carriage returen
[17:52:46] <mysticspiral[m]> \R includes variantes of that + other unicode ways of producing a newline

[18:14:27] <re101-donkey-30> I don't know if this is a PowerAutomate quirk but it doesnt want to pick it up.  I have it set to all matches.  I see it is on a different line when it reads the PDF.  It drops the second date to a differnet line in the Text reader.

[18:26:11] <re101-donkey-30> OnlineCop..it says expression is invalid
[18:26:30] <OnlineCop> re101-donkey-30: Were you the one using PowerAutomate here a few days ago? Did you ever determine how to pull the captured groups out of the regex?
[18:26:44] *** Quits: cmbengue (~Thunderbi@207.191.249.160) (Quit: Thanks, see you later.)
[18:27:09] <OnlineCop> I realize it won't work; my pattern was PCRE so I could define things like what a "Month" is, and reuse it wherever I wanted Jan-Dec. I doubt PowerAutomate supports that.
[18:27:32] <OnlineCop> Is PowerAutomate something that works with Excel? A 3rd-party program?
[18:28:08] <re101-donkey-30> OnlineCop: Yes I was.  Thanks for remembering.  I was able to incorporate your logic and it worked.  I am just pickign up more pieces out of the contracts.  I am tackling one by one and trying to extract it from PDF into excel where I can have all the pieces in a table.
[18:28:36] <re101-donkey-30> PowerAutomate is a robotic process automation tool used for many many different things.  It is like BluePrism or UI Path. Not sure if you have ever heard of those.
[18:29:00] <OnlineCop> PDF obfuscators are notorious for shifting the "actual data" all over the place so, while you can read it as a human, copy-pasting from it gives you all sorts of odd behaviors.
[18:29:22] <OnlineCop> I haven't heard of those, no. I'm just trying to understand what kind of regex "flavor" they're using.
[18:29:46] <re101-donkey-30> It is used for process automation.  It can send out emails, it can create custom applications in an enterprise environment, it can interact with any software by using custom connectors or just through a UI>
[18:30:11] <re101-donkey-30> I know..i have come to realize that...I am almost there its just these little quirks.
[18:30:39] <re101-donkey-30> Can you please provide your other suggestion of /n into an example?  Maybe that is the answer?
[18:30:52] <OnlineCop> It looks like a Microsoft product. Does it have an "official documentation" page? If not, much of Microsoft stuff is a ".NET" regex flavor.
[18:30:52] <re101-donkey-30> I know I can get it but its just iteration of combinations :(
[18:31:17] <OnlineCop> One of the things I noticed with your regex is that you were using this: `(-|Ͳ|–|through|\r?\n)`
[18:31:29] <OnlineCop> Sorry, it DIDN'T have that '\r?' before the '\n'.
[18:31:44] <OnlineCop> That might help fix it. OR you could use `\s+`.
[18:32:18] <OnlineCop> Since \s matches both \r and \n, simply saying "one or more of them" will match any other kinds of whitespace, like tabs/spaces, too.

[18:34:56] <OnlineCop> Does your PDF string _always_ or _sometimes_ contain a newline?
[18:35:00] <purplex> he also seems to be validating month names using extact names, but not date or year which i found strange
[18:35:41] <re101-donkey-30> So the contracts have 2 combinations.  It could be December 21, 2021 - December 2022.  Month Day Year hyphen Month Year. or it could be Monday Day Year hyphen Month Day Year.  I am trying now to get the second combination.  The first combination I got and it seems to be pulling in data.
[18:35:41] <OnlineCop> I think if someone is using "December 99, 9999" then they have bigger problems.
[18:35:48] <purplex> why not use \w+ or [a-z]+ instead then
[18:36:34] <OnlineCop> re101-donkey-30: These are a few alternatives that I see would match: https://regex101.com/r/0opAt3/4
[18:36:45] <re101-donkey-30> online cop.  sometimes.  When I extract the contracts sometimes it puts it on a line below.  I wish I could show you guys but it doesnt allow me to paste screenshots here.
[18:37:24] <OnlineCop> We don't want you to post anything with IP; that could get you into legal trouble.
[18:37:44] <OnlineCop> Any place that could accept a space OR tab OR any kind of newline, I would suggest using `\s+`.
[18:38:13] <OnlineCop> So, between the month and the day. Or, after the day and the comma, and before the year.
[18:39:43] <OnlineCop> Now, as far as the "through" logic goes: will it be some kind of hyphen (with no spaces around it), or [space]through[space], or simply a newline but without '-' or 'Ͳ' or anything?
[18:40:13] <OnlineCop> I'm looking specifically at this: `\s?(-|Ͳ|–|through|\n)\s?`
[18:40:33] <re101-donkey-30> it will be [space]through[space] then could be a hard return.
[18:41:26] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/0opAt3/5
[18:41:28] <re101-donkey-30> or it could be a [space]through[hard return]
[18:42:13] <OnlineCop> A `\s+` can take care of the hard return.
[18:42:31] <OnlineCop> Note that my version has the /x flag, so I could break apart the various portions of it.
[18:43:06] <OnlineCop> I'm also capturing both of the Months, Days, and Years.
[18:43:08] <re101-donkey-30> BINGO!
[18:43:27] <re101-donkey-30> https://regex101.com/r/0opAt3/5 this one worked
[18:43:31] <OnlineCop> So you may not be able to exactly copy-paste it without removing some of the hard returns in the pattern itself, unless PowerAutomate supports /x.
[18:43:45] <OnlineCop> Great!
[18:43:48] <re101-donkey-30> No it doesnt, I noticed that.  Thank you for bringing it up.
[18:44:14] <OnlineCop> I think it's mainly all those whitespace types that were biting you. With `\s+` instead of just `\s` or `\r` or `\n`, etc., it may be what you needed.
[18:45:52] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/0opAt3/6 is the same as /5 but without hard newlines in the pattern, and without the /x flav.
[18:45:54] <OnlineCop> *flag
[18:46:29] <OnlineCop> I'm curious: Does PowerAutomate understand what  (?1)  is?
[18:47:08] <OnlineCop> Specifically, if you had the text "employee" and your regex were `(e)(?1)` then will PowerAutomate be able to match "employ[ee]" ?
[18:47:48] <re101-donkey-30> let me try.
[18:47:56] <OnlineCop> If not, don't worry about it. But if it were to support that `(?1)` notation, you could use it in place of a copy-paste of the (January|February|...|December) group.
[18:49:02] <OnlineCop> It basically says "match the same format that group 1 matched, even if it doesn't match exactly the same text". So group 1 might match "January" but (?1) would be able to match "December".
[18:49:15] <re101-donkey-30> do I need to include the ' on both sides?😊
[18:49:27] <re101-donkey-30> Sorry OnlineCop..I am clueless with this stuff...learning alot here.

[20:36:59] <OnlineCop> Hrmph.
[20:38:56] <koollman> csv is a format people think of as simple. But it's not even a single format, it's dozens (or more) of dialects vaguely looking alike, but subtly different
[20:41:05] <OnlineCop> Most of the time, it's only the delimiter that changes. The other aspects of CSV, at least in my experience, stay fairly consistent. For example, "quotes" surround text that contain the delimiter, and double "" are used within "quotes" when a literal double-quote character is found.

[20:49:31] <purplex> not sure i understood "csv doesn't support recursion" part..
[20:50:11] <OnlineCop> CSV has a fixed number of columns.
[20:50:18] <purplex> right but its just comma separated items
[20:51:14] <OnlineCop> Sure. So column1's data, then a comma. Then you'd throw in a double quote and then paste in a bunch of "more csv" data, followed by the closing double quote, then the comma after column2. Then data for column3, etc.
[20:51:54] <OnlineCop> Even if column2 contained quotes, they'd be escaped as "", and if it contained newlines, then that's perfectly valid too.

[20:55:00] <OnlineCop> Not really. Instead of `.` you'd use `[\S\s]`, or use /s (dotall).

[20:56:18] <OnlineCop> You mean, ensure that all lines contain exactly the same number of columns? That would be difficult; the user would have to explicitly state how many columns to expect.

[21:32:07] <OnlineCop> I think the simplest CSV solution is a group like this: `(["](?>[^"]+|["]{2})*["]|[^,"\r\n]*)`. Obviously, change the comma within that [^, ... ] group to a tab or whatever the delimiter happens to be: https://regex101.com/r/tVQzDP/1
[21:34:43] <OnlineCop> Version /3 if you're using tabs as the delimiter, and so forth.
