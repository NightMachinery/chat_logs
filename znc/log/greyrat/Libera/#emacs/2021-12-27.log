[10:00:51] <incal> let's see if the Emacs from the package manager is still installed somewhere, well, in the same place even, maybe
[10:03:04] <incal> but that doesn't work because there wasn't a `make-closure' at that time
[10:03:18] <incal> and without the init files Gnus won't work anyway
[10:03:37] <incal> maybe reinstall the latest and see if they fixed it ...
[10:03:59] <wgreenhouse> or build stable. or get newer packaged emacs from debian backports
[10:04:27] <wgreenhouse> many options besides [checks notes] running master and insisting someone else email your bug reports for you

[22:01:02] <Catie> Sending SIGHUP to Emacs does something similar, right?
[22:01:03] <johnjaye> goodbye cruel buffers
[22:01:24] <hmw> n0cturna1: That's how python works, I guess. 
[22:01:55] <n0cturna1> it's very bizzare why it would do such a thing imo
[22:02:07] <Catie> Oh SIGHUP kills Emacs. Never mind
[22:02:26] <hmw> Elisp and many others works similar.

[22:05:39] <johnjaye> it appears ctrl-G acts similarly to SIGINT
[22:05:39] <hmw> I think if you redefine the function, the new definition will be the vaid one.
