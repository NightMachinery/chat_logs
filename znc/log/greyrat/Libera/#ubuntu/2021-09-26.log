[00:16:00] <Afdal> It's not merely corrupted sources lists; I've already tried deleting everything in /var/lib/apt/lists/ and that doesn't help
[00:16:06] <cbreak> xenial? Isn't that, like, prehistoric?
[00:16:29] <Afdal> Yeah, yeah... I know it's EOL.  I just need this apt problem resolved and then I'm doing a release upgrade.
[00:16:57] <leftyfb> Afdal: remove all of the repo's mentioned at the bottom
[00:17:04] <cbreak> I wouldn't be surprised if the servers for that thing have been shut down, or at least the no longer needed stuff deleted
[00:17:04] <Afdal> This just started occurring out of the blue yesterday and I can't figure out what the problem is.

[00:17:49] <leftyfb> Afdal: xenial is no longer supported, which means most repo's will be removing support for it
[00:18:17] <morganu> jeremy31, I have constantly had problems since I installed 20.04 and had to reboot.
[00:18:33] <Afdal> Is there an easy way to save repo lists so I can re-add them again once I've released upgraded?
[00:18:33] <morganu> and thanks for this fix.
[00:18:57] <leftyfb> Afdal: you are better off only adding repo's you know you need after the fact

[00:20:30] <cbreak> does it even make sense to upgrade a xenial machine?
[00:20:38] <cbreak> maybe reinstalling 20.04 fresh is better
[00:20:47] <cbreak> maybe not. :/
[00:20:48] <tomreyn> probably

[00:26:57] <cbreak> I've installed ubuntu without it locking up
[00:27:06] <Afdal> I have a cryptic motherboard problem relating to monitor output that basically causes my system to freeze in various scenarios
[00:27:24] <cbreak> that sounds annoying.
[00:27:28] <Afdal> They usually have to do with unplugging or sending an off signal to an active monitor
[00:27:56] <Afdal> but most Linux installers also make it happen even after I take steps to disable power control
[00:28:07] <cbreak> wonder if that problem also manifests itself with a dedicated GPU
[00:28:16] <Afdal> I do have a dedicated GPU
[00:28:18] <cbreak> or with an ubuntu server installer without X
[00:28:19] <Afdal> But it's not the GPU
[00:28:26] <Afdal> This was a problem with a previous GPU as well
[00:28:45] <Afdal> I've pretty much replaced every part in this system now and the motherboard is the last possible culprit
[00:28:58] <cbreak> the server installers can install ubuntu server, which can later be upgraded to something similar to ubuntu desktop
[00:29:24] <cbreak> maybe it's your monitors? :/
[00:29:29] <tomreyn> debootstrap would also work, there it's certainly to you to handle signalling.

[00:36:12] <Afdal> Thanks a bunch
[00:36:46] <tomreyn> your main problem remains unsolved, though.
[00:36:51] <Afdal> Seems weird to me that dead repositories can cause the entire apt system to breakdown
[00:36:58] <Afdal> instead of simply being ignored
[00:37:05] <tomreyn> you
[00:37:19] <tomreyn> are running an EOL system, that's the definition of broken

[02:06:09] <Sven_vB> hi :) I have some devices that interfere with my bluetooth audio when they're active, and I'd like to detect them to log dates and timespans when the interferences are present. I could imagine setting up a bluetooth audio sender/receiver pair, transmit DTMF and detect the anomalies. might there be an easier way? could my USB BT antenna maybe monitor interference passively?

[04:39:01] <r0tt13> i looked at netplan.io and used an example for vlan, but that seems to add a vlan, but i want it tied to the main if.
[04:39:48] <r0tt13> currently when i add a vlan section with an address it now makes both ips pingable, but it seems to have issues with a default route
[04:40:04] <r0tt13> also i used 2 addresses to make it work... seems incorrect as an approach
[04:40:52] <r0tt13> current config:
[04:41:46] <r0tt13> enp3s0 has a 10.0.10.x, then vlan also has the same but incretmented by 1
[04:42:17] <r0tt13> should i be leaving enp3s0 blank and move the default config to the vlan?

[12:05:06] <silatel> can someone tell me if it's possible to install dual boot windows alongside ubuntu 20.04 main?
[12:05:35] <enyc> silatel: yes but much easier if windows installed first, or preferably on a separate hard disk
[12:05:59] <enyc> silatel: unplug linux disk while do the latter,  yo ucan get into all sorts of fun with windows overwriting bootloader and making linux 'unbootable'
[12:06:12] <silatel> enyc: the thing is i have all my important things on ubuntu rn and i dont have a hard drive
[12:06:22] <silatel> enyc: that's why i'm trying to install windows
[12:06:29] <enyc> silatel: In any case, look at virtualization for windowsrather than dual-booting
[12:06:56] <enyc> silatel: or indeed alternative apps -- what is the windows-need anyhow, others here may be able to help!
[12:06:58] <silatel> enyc: my laptop is old so virtualization runs very slow
[12:07:14] <silatel> enyc: the single and only windows need is to play dota 2 :D

[12:07:34] <silatel> enyc: because it runs very slow on ubuntu, but i remember a couple years ago it was running better when i had windows

[12:14:37] <silatel> enyc: i also read about Pop OS, can i install that alongside ubuntu?

[15:16:47] <privato89> I got a problem which I think it relates to the gnome shell. I'm using Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Focal Fossa. I noticed lately that every time the gnome shell reboots or I reboot it manually via ALT + F2 + R, after it, the screen change resolution and everything gets bigger, so to solve I have to restart the system.
[15:16:47] <privato89> Why should happen this and how to fix it?

[23:50:00] <tomreyn> this would update permissions and ownership on all files in this very directory /var/lib/apt/lists to match what i'm seeing
[23:50:10] <ramblebamble> tomreyn, what are the "+" signs for never seen that before
[23:51:28] <tomreyn> ramblebamble: it's a way to indicate to gnu find that the command to be executed ends there

[23:52:25] <ramblebamble> ah so that way find executes 2 exec commands at once? I always  used \; the terminate exec, quite interesting thanks
[23:53:12] <TJ-> ramblebamble: \; only passes one {} but \+ will add as mnay {} as it can to the -exec chown command line
[23:53:28] <tomreyn> find(1) -> ACTIONS -> -exec command {} +
[23:53:30] <TJ-> ramblebamble: which results in less executions of the chown command
[23:54:03] <ramblebamble> TJ- thanks
[23:54:46] <TJ-> ramblebamble: in other words; more than one filename is put on the 'chown' command line
[23:55:34] <ramblebamble> yes gotcha, I am always amazed, you know the manpages you read them every once in a while if you need sth and you are still missing stuff :D
[23:55:51] <TJ-> ramblebamble: especially 'find' !
[23:56:28] <ramblebamble> yeah, and also sed and awk and they are what? 20-30 years old now?

[23:57:21] <TJ-> about 14 years ago I was writing long awk programs to analyse ACPI DSDT; forgotten so much, and go back to that code to re-learn the tricks!
