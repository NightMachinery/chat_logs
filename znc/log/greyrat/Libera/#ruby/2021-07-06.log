[07:56:02] <nakilon> how am I supposed to make native extensions if there is no one to ask how to make them?
[07:56:14] <nakilon> these C errors never make any sense
[07:56:33] <nakilon> like I'm the only person trying to make them for last two years
[07:57:26] <nakilon> I'm not even saying that native extensions are broken on alpine since 2.4
[07:57:39] <nakilon> how it appears to be impossible to even add a single method to Math module
[07:59:59] <nakilon> dyld: lazy symbol binding failed: Symbol not found: _rb_num_to_dbl
[08:02:11] <nakilon> this rb_num_to_dbl is in object.h and object.c, but "object.h not found" and with object.c it throws:  Symbol not found: _rb_mod_deprecate_constant (LoadError)
[08:03:53] <nakilon> how it is in variable.c but it throws: Symbol not found: _rb_obj_hash (LoadError)
[08:05:33] <nakilon> it is in hash.c but now it throws "error: redefinition of 'inspect_i'" in object.c because "note: previous definition is here" in hash.c
[08:05:59] <nakilon> and no one ever helps with native extensions
[08:06:05] <nakilon> and there is nowhere to ask
[08:06:14] <nakilon> because emails don't reach the maillist
[08:06:28] <nakilon> and questions get deleted from SO
[08:06:58] <nakilon> what's the point of having the whole native extensions thing if no one helps with it and it works for only like 5 people in the world and there is no way to ask them how they did it?
[08:07:19] <nakilon> it frustrates me for 2 years already, I've spent weeks on it

[11:07:58] <leftylink> sigh... my editor mishighlights certain sequences of Ruby code... perhaps I should file a bug with them...
[11:08:49] <leftylink> minimal reproduction sequence of code is "#{?+ if 5}#{whatever}" - it thinks the second # starts a comment when it obviously doesn't
[11:09:53] <leftylink> highlights correctly if it's ?a or something, but not ?+ or ?( or ?% and maybe some other characters that I won't all check exhaustively

[11:15:12] <leftylink> it also doesn't understand "#{%}#{%}%}}}}" because it mismatches the brackets, but I guess I'm okay with that because nobody would ever write this string in real code anyway
[11:16:42] <gr33n7007h> leftylink: i can confirm this is also broken in nano & vim too.
[11:18:11] <leftylink> oh and what's worse with the "#{?+ if 5}#{}" thing is my editor then gets confused about the proper indentation level of subsequent code... slight PITA that, but I think after I manually corrected one or two lines subsequent lines had no problem
[11:20:05] <gr33n7007h> nakilon: have you considered using FFI?
[11:22:23] <nakilon> gr33n7007h I'm not making bindings
[11:23:17] <gr33n7007h> nakilon: out of curiosity, what are you making?
[11:24:16] <nakilon> this one was just hypot3, i.e. sqrt(x^2+y^2+z^2)
[11:25:00] <nakilon> ended up copypasting three functions from ruby source and then editing them eliminating if branches to just avoid these errors
[11:26:13] <nakilon> while with my bigint-based extensions this trick didn't work
