[00:01:20] <Cl0udNinja> bdenlinger: not so fun fact.. I started down the proxysql road because a dev wrote a query that got pushed through to production on thousands of systems, which did 3 queries, separately, via code. 1: select a bunch of IDs. 2: select a bunch of other IDs. 3: combine the results in code. 4: select a bunch of data where IDs in (........256 MB of IDs......)
[00:01:52] <monr0e> Sounds like someone needs indexing and sprocs
[00:02:35] <sd> 08<bâ€‹denlinger> hmm I think I need ProxySQL anyways because the replica has to have the same connectivity as the source. Source DB is not publicly accessible.
[00:02:38] <Cl0udNinja> no, someone needed a firm backhand for allowing a 256MB query to be created, let alone pushed to production
[00:02:57] <monr0e> Oh, so this wasn't a run-of-the-mill query then
[00:03:28] <Cl0udNinja> yeah, no, someone did a dumb, and allowed it to continue to production until I found it, when it was crashing hundreds of events
[00:03:42] <Cl0udNinja> bdenlinger setup your own instance and manually configure replication?
[00:04:06] <monr0e> iirc we had a query-to-batch thing at the LA I used to work for. You could never pull more than 30mb at once, and it would pull in batches. Had to do some extra legwork but it was vastly superior to the other option
[00:04:21] <sd> 08<bâ€‹denlinger> Honestly it's fine. ProxySQL has a docker image so it would take literally 10 seconds to standup and bridge the VNet
[00:04:36] <Cl0udNinja> bdenlinger I just dont think its gonna fit for your case
[00:04:44] <sd> 08<bâ€‹denlinger> Probably not
[00:05:02] <Cl0udNinja> you can try it, but I think an Azure instance configured as a replica manually would work
[00:05:32] <Cl0udNinja> (Azure MySQL)->((Azure Instance; Configured with pub and private IP)->(MySQL Replica))
[00:05:39] <sd> 08<bâ€‹denlinger> Or stand up a replica in their env and use VPN to replicate over.
[00:05:46] <Cl0udNinja> yeah
[00:05:55] <Cl0udNinja> you just said VPN was likely to not work
[00:05:57] <Cl0udNinja> but VPN would be best
[00:06:19] <sd> 08<bâ€‹denlinger> Their shit's gonna get trashed soon anyways. Big daddy corp is gonna make everyone use PowerBI.
[00:06:43] <sd> 08<bâ€‹denlinger> Well the issue with VPN is a human issue so I can just lean on my manager to fix it.

[00:08:25] <Cl0udNinja> I built up this nice automated testing process for our app at work (current job). It catches gitlab-ci, and then checks out the automated_testing repo, and sets up a VM, deploys the app, runs tests, and then saves the test data and destroys the VM. I automated the implementation of all of this so that you just have to run a single command to set a repo up for the automated testing.

[02:18:50] <shakygator> i think the service is just starting too early, so looking into delaying it or adding some dependency on another service. or even an automatic restart on failure (start failure might now invoke this?)
[02:18:52] <Cl0udNinja> haproxy's systemd might need to be adjusted to start later, after the agent services instead of after network

[03:44:05] <monr0e> why am i not surprised
[03:47:12] <CoJaBo> Everyone is doing it tho
[03:47:31] <monr0e> Eh, not really. Only people/orgs with money to burn.
[03:47:32] <CoJaBo> So we need to support them too, but I'm not sure what the standard is supposed to be
[03:47:37] <monr0e> or more money than sense
[03:48:17] <monr0e> Well, thats the point - there *is* no standard. The entire premise is built on the complete decentralisation of not only web interactivity, but the standards on which it is built
[03:49:04] <CoJaBo> Facebook and Google do it tho
[03:49:27] <CoJaBo> Are they actually just running the JS or something, just to get the page title and desc? That seems insane
[03:49:28] <monr0e> Please don't take your industry indications from the actions of facebook and google
[03:50:00] <monr0e> google has shelved more projects than I've started, and I have a habit of starting projects that I work on for precisely a day and never finish
[03:52:51] <CoJaBo> monr0e: Yeh, but then what do we do? People are saying our stuff's broke, because it works when linked from Faceb0rk and almost every other site
[03:54:44] <monr0e> Well, if you can't get out of that market, treat it like any other problem. Apart from the decentralisation and the usually unnecessary inclusion of blockchain, it is principally *just another app*. Find the creator and talk to them.
[03:55:25] <monr0e> In fact, thats the only way you're going to get anywhere, given the  lack of canonised standards 
[04:00:17] <monr0e> Oh, and if you're doing any interactivity, you'll have to have some involvement in whatever blockchain supports that application - if they don't have a bespoke coin, that will probably be ethereum

[11:54:36] <tarek58> hey everyone.  I have to convert a linux VM that was running in HyperV (vhdx) to an openstack compatible cloud.  I've used qemu-img to 'convert' the vhdx file to a qcow.  I can create a VM with that image, but when I boot, the console just says 'Booting from hard disk...' and sits there forever.  Anyone have any ideas how to repair / get this situation working?

[12:00:24] <Cl0udNinja> tarek58, idk the qemu-img way, but I can tell you a not so fun way that works reliably
[12:02:21] <Cl0udNinja> make an openstack instance, 2 disks. live CD on the target VM. `dd if=/dev/sda | pigz -ck | ssh user@newinstance 'sudo pigz -dck | dd of=/dev/sdb'`
[12:02:43] <Cl0udNinja> after that, chroot mount the second disk, update-grub, update-initramfs

[12:09:21] <Cl0udNinja> tarek58, np. I ended up having to go that route for GCP/Azure image creation because other methods (packer) were shit
[12:09:46] <tarek58> yes, a lot of tutorials were leaning on packer, essentially useless for my purposes
[12:09:59] <Cl0udNinja> yeah for a single thing just keep it simple

[19:06:54] <Joe-Developer> well like AnonymooseReddtr said the elgato products are great, they've got a Cam Link 4k which can capture video output from a camera

[19:33:27] <estranger> sounds terrible
[19:33:30] <signofzeta> Power Automate is quite useful, though.  I set up a flow (yeah, they didn't rename it to "an automate") to pull files from a mailbox and stick them onto the file server so their accounting software could ingest them.
[19:33:35] <estranger> why are huge enterprises looking to use this
[19:33:48] <estranger> i feel like.... you should have the skills to build your own apps properly

[19:36:48] <signofzeta> yeah, well, the accounting software can only read files from a folder, and their website vendor can only dump files onto a web server or a mailbox, and the accounting software doesn't support POP3 or IMAP, either.  It's a properly-made dirty solution.

House flies will lay their eggs on items such as feces, rotting carcasses, and decaying fruit. Why is this? Well, itâ€™s mainly to provide the larvae (maggots) with something to eat when they hatch.
