[22:15:36] <murthy> like they use intra region and other terminology
[22:16:01] <murthy> all I want to know is how much I will be charged for when people use my website and download stuff
[22:16:18] <DOMF> That's not intra region
[22:16:22] <DOMF> that's external transfer 
[22:16:32] <murthy> "To internet"?
[22:16:37] <DOMF> intra region is like if you transfered data between us-west-1 and us-east-1
[22:16:40] <DOMF> yeah, "to internet"
[22:16:45] <murthy> oh ok
[22:16:57] <murthy> so 1 gb free per month and the rest cost?

[22:27:54] <artao> rather, they found a way to make a nanoscale structure that could possibly be put on a chip to test it all out
