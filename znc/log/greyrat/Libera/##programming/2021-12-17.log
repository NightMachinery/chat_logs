[00:12:44] <pyzozord> Raziel: that's not really a game, it's pretty much a program
[00:12:51] <vdamewood> But Qt doesn't require any changes to the source that can't be done by the compiler.

[00:27:32] <vdamewood> Yeah, that's basically it.
[00:27:54] <apotheon> It seems to be, in a way, like a preprocessor that just saves what it expands elsewhere instead of inline.
[00:28:02] <vdamewood> There's also a macro you put in to Qt-based classes, Q_OBJECT, that has a few functions in it. moc generates the implementations of those, too.
[00:28:19] <apotheon> . . . which might not be considered a preprocessor if the assumption of the term's definition is that what it expands is "here" and not "elsewhere".

[01:28:12] <vdamewood> KillerWasp: Well, sort of. the 386 used 32-bit segments, and 32-bit offsets for a 32-bit space. So everyone just set the segments to 0.
[01:28:22] <pyzozord> keep digits for numbers
[01:28:28] <Decker> 386 wsan't really flat memory - there was still segment selectors for code, data, stack, (extra working addresers)

[01:28:50] <pyzozord> that is what eats up all the processing power, absurdly wasteful
[01:29:32] <vdamewood> pyzozord: One of the downsides to analog technology is that copies degrade in quality.

[06:38:12] <[itchyjunk]> i googled and found eth is moving away form PoW to PoS

[06:38:24] <apotheon> jkk: How is it Orwellian?
[06:38:24] <[itchyjunk]> can't keep up with this shit
[06:39:04] <apotheon> jkk: If there's a centralized database, instead of a decentralized database, it's easier to surveil people's transactions, because they're all directly monitored by the central system.
[06:39:10] <[itchyjunk]> yo dawg i hear you like blockchains so i put blockchains on blockchains so you can mine while mining
[06:39:14] <jkk> apotheon, yep

[06:39:24] <[itchyjunk]> decentralized != anynomous
[06:39:31] <jkk> true
[06:39:34] <apotheon> [itchyjunk]: That's beside the point.
[06:39:44] <[itchyjunk]> you can still surveil people on decentralized network
[06:39:56] <[itchyjunk]> and people can still maintain a level of privacy in a centralized one
[06:39:59] <apotheon> It's *easier* to monitor with a central database, so a CBDC will almost certainly use a centralized database.
[06:40:07] <[itchyjunk]> that's not a given.
[06:40:09] <jkk> so CCP digi yuan - instant control of all transactions by ML algos with impact on 'social credit'
[06:40:26] <jkk> later on control is passed to 'ai'
[06:40:29] <[itchyjunk]> homomorphic encryption means it you can have pseudonomous centralized database 
[06:40:34] <apotheon> [itchyjunk]: What is the benefit of using a blockchain for a CBDC?
[06:41:17] <jkk> question is why there is no public anti blockchain usd demos in usa? ;)
[06:41:17] <[itchyjunk]> distributed trust
[06:41:26] <apotheon> You don't need distributed trust for a CBDC.
[06:41:41] <apotheon> In fact, you don't *want* distributed trust for a CBDC.
[06:41:45] <[itchyjunk]> You don't need fiat currency at all.
[06:41:48] <PlanckWalk> Yes, I was about to say
[06:41:49] <apotheon> The whole point of a CBDC is ensuring centralized control.
[06:41:56] <[itchyjunk]> bartering is a primitive but workable substitute.
[06:42:10] <apotheon> If you want distributed trust, you want a DC without the CB.
[06:42:11] <[itchyjunk]> Sure you do. distributed doesn't mean everyone is involved.
[06:42:36] <PlanckWalk> The incentives for a CBDC are utterly different from those of a private cryptocurrency
[06:42:37] <apotheon> Why would a central bank want distributed trust?
[06:42:44] <[itchyjunk]> IBM's distributed ledgers provide "low trust" solutions to certain problem types
[06:42:46] <apotheon> Why wouldn't the central bank want to be the single point of truth?
[06:42:49] <jkk> guess when will usa abolish cash?
[06:42:57] <[itchyjunk]> central banks do distribute some of their "trust" mechanism already.

[06:43:21] <PlanckWalk> They delegate, not distribute.
[06:43:29] <jkk> PlanckWalk, yep
[06:43:41] <apotheon> The point of a CBDC would be to increase the degree of control held by the central entity.
[06:43:44] <apotheon> That's the whole point.

[06:44:44] <apotheon> The control isn't as deep, though.
[06:44:46] <jkk> apotheon, i had some we chat accounts they ban them fast 
[06:44:55] <jkk> apotheon, how come
[06:44:59] <apotheon> At present, it's still possible to engage in private transactions -- even easy -- with cash.

[06:46:01] <Satin> false
[06:46:01] <apotheon> I feel like [itchyjunk] isn't actually paying any attention to what I'm saying.

[06:48:25] <jkk> 4.0 multi gender IPs
[06:48:27] <jkk> Xd
[06:48:56] <Satin> jkk: because "gender" is a social construct. Something being a social construct does not make it artificial or fake but it describes a quality, characteristic of it, being informed and shaped by one's respective culture and society.
[06:49:17] <[itchyjunk]> $ is social construct too
[06:49:23] <jkk> Satin, gender was used to actually describe a physical gender
[06:49:27] <jkk> nothing to do with fantasy
[06:50:02] <jkk> people do not change into a cat by saying cat gender
[06:50:34] <Satin> jkk: Gender was coined some decades ago when humans themselves were begun to be considered things to be studied. People realized quickly that things like mannerisms, identity, roles and so on were not the same universally or anything.
[06:50:58] <Satin> (to be fair it was coined by a very despicable person named John Money, but that doesn't mean it was developed by plenty of other people later..)
[06:51:01] <jkk> Satin, gender means gender such as male or female
[06:51:04] <jkk> that is it
[06:51:16] <jkk> if people want to demand from others to call them cat dog well

[06:51:34] <Satin> jkk: no, that's biological sex. gender is more in line with what a "man" and "woman" are conceptualized, thought of, what gender roles are associated with them, mannerisms, expectations and so on
[06:51:40] <jkk> sex means having sex
[06:51:57] <jkk> in English gender refers to physical men or women
[06:52:07] <jkk> hijacking words does not change it
[06:52:08] <Satin> there are multiple lines of evidence for this, from anthropology to sociological studies of other cultures
[06:52:13] <jkk> like gay is happy
[06:52:15] <jkk> that is it
[06:52:33] <Stryyker> like a golden gaytime
[06:52:41] <Satin> language can't change apparently? why not just stick to old 17th century english then?

[06:53:00] <jkk> invent new word at least
[06:53:09] <Stryyker> Satin: We're not speaking french :)
[06:53:11] <Satin> no, it is not hijacking, that is culture shifting
[06:53:17] <jkk> its stealing

[06:54:28] <[itchyjunk]> Colloquial meaning of that word is different.
[06:54:31] <jkk> alright then
[06:54:39] <jkk> lets change meaning of some other words
[06:54:48] <[itchyjunk]> You can, if  you want.
[06:54:49] <jkk> feminism lets call it shit
[06:54:51] <jkk> why not
[06:54:52] <Themis3000> Lol what??
[06:54:55] <Stryyker> english is awesome, one word can have multiple meanings and possibly multiple ways of saying it
[06:54:55] <jkk> why not

[06:55:18] <jkk> homosexual can steal gay
[06:55:24] <jkk> so feminists can be called shit

[07:01:23] <Themis3000> Satin: I think factorio starts off not very taxing but as you build more machines it gets really really cpu intensive
[07:01:34] <jkk> y. Gender identity refers to a person’s deeply felt, internal and individual experience of gender, which may or may not correspond to the person’s physiology or designated sex at birth. - not a sex identify? :)

[08:02:48] <[itchyjunk]> Satin, nice looks cool
[08:02:59] <[itchyjunk]> too bad my shit craptop can't run games
[08:03:04] <Satin> RIP
[08:03:07] <[itchyjunk]> just tried a browserbased games and everything crashed
[08:03:15] <[itchyjunk]> Satin, heard of autonauts?
[08:03:22] <[itchyjunk]> games dope as fuck
[08:03:31] <Satin> I have not, I'll look into that.
[08:03:40] <[itchyjunk]> you can make little robots and visual program to automate tasks
[08:03:47] <Satin> fascinating
[08:03:54] <[itchyjunk]> like chopping trees or planting seeds etc
[08:04:07] <[itchyjunk]> and different tier of robots have different storage space and such
[08:04:22] <[itchyjunk]> so basic robots can't do more than one task really, not enough memory
[08:04:46] <[itchyjunk]> amigojapan, sometimes good softwares market themselves
[08:04:53] <[itchyjunk]> factorio did very little marketing
[08:05:00] <PlanckWalk> Does it play okay on linux?
[08:05:12] <[itchyjunk]> factorio or autonauts?
[08:05:17] <[itchyjunk]> factorio apparently plays well in linux
[08:05:17] <PlanckWalk> Either really I guess
[08:05:26] <PlanckWalk> But I was askign about autonauts
[08:05:27] <amigojapan> [itchyjunk]: many good software are hardly known at all . That is very common
[08:05:38] <[itchyjunk]> Not sure, only played autonauts on windows
[08:06:09] <amigojapan> [itchyjunk]: the market or saturated, people are stupid
[08:06:25] <amigojapan> [itchyjunk]: take the Linux desktop as an example
[08:07:03] <[itchyjunk]> Man, I wasted today. Should have learned a little more godot or something
[08:07:39] <dice342> amigojapan: then why dont ppl make money off them
[08:07:48] <dice342> by turning them into companies if the software is so good and free?

[13:36:42] <mariorossi111> hi all, i have been asked to upgrade and fix a huge codebase of legacy php code. it there an accepted series of best practices on how to design and mantain a codebase in 2021? ideally focused on PHP
[13:38:36] <vdamewood> Hi, people etc.
[13:38:58] <vdamewood> mercenary: In 2021, the best practice is not to use PHP.
[13:39:02] <vdamewood> mariorossi111: ^
[13:39:07] <vdamewood> mercenary: Sorry.
[13:39:10] <Decker> ... the emphasis doesn't seem important - like the number exists, sure, and it's interesting to note, but I'm not really sure basing math on it is the right thing to do; since it's just a computed output anyway
[13:39:25] <mercenary> vdamewood: I could not agree more
[13:39:37] <Decker> but it exists, and it has to be done so...
[13:39:40] <Decker> git.
[13:39:45] <Decker> beyond that I can't help :)

[13:40:45] <vdamewood> mariorossi111: Serious answer: PHP has fallen out of favor but there are still two fairly large projects that use it, Drupal and Wordpress. The only thing I can think of, though, is to use MySQLi instead of MySQL, and if you include any files, DON'T put them under DocumentRoot.
[13:41:22] <mariorossi111> mercenary I believe you're mistaken about PHP and I suggest you check out modern PHP code; aside from the usual trite holy wars, i'm not going to switch a literal 30 years codebase from PHP to anything different, I'll slowly move the core to golang or rust, but that's secondary at the moment
[13:42:00] <vdamewood> Between Go and Rust, my vote's for Go.
[13:42:03] <mariorossi111> vdamewood mysqli is basically deprecated in favor of PDO
[13:42:19] <mariorossi111> i'm clueless about both, go seems to be better suited for web-facing services
[13:42:23] <vdamewood> mariorossi111: Ah, okay. The last time I touched PHP was 2012.
[13:42:33] <Decker> node.js for webservices

[13:43:30] <vdamewood> mariorossi111: I did a job in Go once. There was only one annoying thing about Go, it wouldn't let me have unused variables while I was writing code.
[13:43:32] <Decker> mariorossi111 *shrug* so much better than php though
[13:43:43] <mercenary> mariorossi111: I will use PHP if I have to (i.e. if it's 500 lines to make a WP plugin, and let the graphics people do the rest in WP). But the language has grown too many warts over time
[13:43:45] <Decker> but then 95% of what I end up using for the services is actually C

[15:39:50] <merijn> If you have a type with 1 parameter and you can invent two functions with those types and obeying the laws, you have a monad. Now, typically in haskell we don't use "compose :: (a -> m b) -> (b -> m c) -> a -> m c', but it exists

[15:41:37] <merijn> To give a concrete example, since GeDaMo mentioned "Maybe": We have 'data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a', okay, so parametric type: check
[15:42:02] <merijn> Now, can we invent a definition of return and compose that follows the laws?
[15:42:24] <merijn> Start with return: 'return x = Just x' that has 'a -> Maybe a', so the type fits
[15:43:14] <merijn> 'compose f g a = case f x of { Nothing -> Nothing; Just b -> g b }'
[15:43:34] <merijn> That has the correct '(a -> Maybe b) -> (b -> Maybe c) -> a -> Maybe c' type

[15:49:25] <merijn> Just is a constructor
[15:50:17] <jollygood2> problem with understanding usefulness of monads in other languages is that they usually don't have: 1) higher kinded types, and with that ability to write generic code that works with any monad instance 2) to lesser extent, syntax that makes working with monads nicer
[15:50:19] <merijn> pyzozord: "data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a" says: We define a type Maybe that takes 1 type argument. It has two possible constructors: Nothing, which takes no arguments. And 'Just' which takes 1 argument of the type passed to Maybe
[15:50:25] <GeDaMo> 'Maybe' is like an abstract superclass, 'Just' and 'Nothing' are concrete subclasses
[15:50:50] <GeDaMo> A Maybe can be a Just or a Nothing

[16:47:28] <diophantoz> so frontend frameworks like react/angular makes backend frameworks unnecessary?
[16:47:30] <pyzozord> they essentially have their own libraries in python for writing python microservices
[16:47:48] <diophantoz> angular is fullstack tho, it says
[16:48:31] <pyzozord> it makes mvc backend frameworks unecessary in some sense, because your backend will only ever render json
[16:48:52] <pyzozord> but the model and controler parts are still useful
[16:49:11] <deniska> diophantoz: frontend/backend distinction makes sense when it's two teams working on a site

[16:49:25] <deniska> diophantoz: for single person project you want a quick way of doing things

[16:56:12] <[itchyjunk]> Hello, any graphviz users? What is your opinions of it? 
[16:56:24] <deniska> at least when a page reloads, you have a clear indication by a browser that something is happening

[19:15:37] <vin> Static threshold, say 2x (full points) 1.5x 0. 0.5x 0.25x (some points)  than baseline won't work since there can be cases where no number is greater than 2x.
