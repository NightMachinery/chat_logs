[21:28:01] <Janet`> ^ The Donner Party was a group of American pioneers who migrated to California in a wagon train from the Midwest. Delayed by a multitude of mishaps, they spent the winter of 1846–1847 snowbound in the Sierra Nevada mountain range.

[21:43:31] <murthy> Ya
[21:43:47] <murthy> Reminds me of old telephone exchanges
[21:44:03] <macrobat> "A digital audio workstation (DAW) is an electronic device or application software used for recording, editing and producing audio files."
[21:44:08] <artao> which can interface with real world eurorack equipment
[21:44:21] <macrobat> CV means control voltage
[21:44:42] <murthy> btw there is a new release of pipewire with jack related improvements
[21:44:51] <murthy> macrobat: oh
[21:45:08] <murthy> So virtual control voltage rack
[21:45:13] <murthy> Got it
[21:45:20] <artao> with Reaper you can install ReaWire. which rocks.
[21:45:46] <artao> i think i've got it set to 32 virtual ASIO channels. but it could do more
[21:45:50] <murthy> macrobat: daw, learned today
[21:46:02] <macrobat> a rack is like a server rack, but you put musical gear in there
[21:46:15] <macrobat> instead of computers
[21:46:29] <artao> rather than choose the audio interface as output you choose reawire, then open that channel in whatever other software
[21:46:37] <artao> is it reawire?
[21:47:36] <murthy> macrobat: I remember someone complaining about a rack module creating noise

[21:52:03] <murthy> Ya I am a music noob remember?
[21:52:06] <artao> it's "kind of" a DAW, kind of a rack-mount system emulation

[21:52:49] <murthy> Like a Ableton?
[21:52:50] <artao> it's damn cool software tho
[21:53:07] <artao> no. Ableton is a DAW, straight up
[21:53:30] <artao> Reason is a rack-mount music system with DAW capabilites
[21:53:37] <murthy> I am going to deprecate Ableton with LMMS
[21:53:46] <artao> deprecate?
[21:53:55] <artao> ableton and lmms are totally different paradigms
[21:54:02] <murthy> Send them packing
[21:54:09] <artao> lmms is more akin to fl studio. they're loop/pattern based
[21:54:21] <novns> just use Reaper

[21:54:54] <artao> and cakewalk. sometimes ableton, cuz i only have ableton lite
[21:55:01] <louipc> ableton is like ardour?
[21:55:06] <artao> no
[21:55:10] <louipc> paradigm?
[21:55:24] <artao> kind of, but not really. ableton is its own thing
[21:55:27] <novns> murthy, it is, but you can use trial version forever without any limits
[21:55:35] <louipc> wow its a whole new paradigm?
[21:55:37] <artao> ardour is more like reaper or cubase etc
[21:55:46] <novns> ardour sucks
[21:55:51] *** deadroses is now known as solveig
[21:55:52] <murthy> novns: ah then no. Only FOSS software
[21:56:03] <louipc> why sucks?
[21:56:05] <artao> ableton is more oriented toward live use type stuff
[21:56:14] <novns> murthy, there are no decent open sourced DAWs
[21:56:26] <murthy> novns: agreed
[21:56:39] <novns> you can try Ardour but it will fail
[21:56:49] <murthy> novns: I will spend sometime with LMMS and related later
[21:56:58] <efex> Reaper as just great by all reports and silly cheap tho
[21:57:01] <murthy> novns: will check
[21:57:16] <louipc> why fail?
[21:57:20] <novns> murthy, oh, and Reaper runs natively in linux

[21:57:43] <murthy> novns: nice
[21:57:46] <louipc> ouch
[21:57:48] <efex> the  home version is like $60,and the Pro liscenced version is only 26$ more than logic pro, pretty good
[21:57:49] <artao> it just nags you once per day
[21:57:57] <artao> and is only 60 bucks to buy
