[01:12:47] <chazy> i can't believe this: $notSent = array_udiff($paid, $sent, fn ($a, $b) => $a->from <=> $b->to); $notSent is exactly like $paid, why?
[01:13:19] <chazy> $paid = json_decode(file_get_contents(__DIR__.'/paid.json'))->result; same for $sent
[01:14:14] <chazy> i have manually checked and i can see from and to in both files (for some cases) but it's not removing those that are in both files, why?

[01:17:06] <Blondie101010> does your employer realize that his payment system is in the hands of IRC help?
[01:17:38] <chazy> old payment system, from the guy who just left without any explanation......
[01:17:51] <Togra> yolo
[01:18:24] <chazy> still, any idea why array_udiff() is not working as expected?
[01:21:30] <da_wunder> chazy: show us example on 3v4l.org site of that array_udiff
[01:21:58] <chazy> like using only a few transactions in the arrays?
[01:22:21] <Blondie101010> that could allow you to learn to troubleshoot
[01:22:45] <chazy> or i can use the raw url from github
[01:23:22] <da_wunder> create an example to 3v4l.org site
[01:23:40] <Blondie101010> chazy: you didn't show any traces you put to understand what is happening
[01:24:00] <Blondie101010> so we can basically just expect you again to not know your data and what the code your write does
[01:24:03] <Blondie101010> (both!!!)
[01:25:31] <chazy> my data is from bscscan.com.... and i'm comparing 2 properties which in some cases the values from both files are identical
[01:25:37] <chazy> still, it's not filtering them out
[01:25:41] <chazy> how is that my problem?
[01:25:58] <Blondie101010> what are you trying to do?
[01:26:13] <chazy> filter from paid what's already been sent
[01:26:16] <Blondie101010> both arrays are obviously not the same at all as they don't even have the same properties
[01:26:18] <da_wunder> so show us the problem with example within 3v4l.org site...
[01:26:43] <chazy> yes one second i can't use https in 3v4l.org
[01:26:57] <da_wunder> you said that you're using array_udiff - so it should not be so hard to present example of your issue - right?
[01:26:58] <Blondie101010> not the problem you're seeing!
[01:27:13] <Blondie101010> so that idea won't work
[01:27:38] <Blondie101010> copy a few records from each array
[01:27:46] <da_wunder> and something like "i can't use https in 3v4l.org" sounds really absurd
[01:28:18] <Blondie101010> chazy:  once you make a real test case, you'll already know your mistake!
[01:28:36] <Blondie101010> *that* is troubleshooting
[01:42:41] <chazy> ugh, i need to sleep... what's wrong with this json string? https://3v4l.org/4lKSZ
[01:46:59] <chazy> so if i have 2 json files, one with more objects than the other, how do i filter out the objects that match in both?
[01:47:23] <Blondie101010> or even know if your alignment makes sense
[01:47:42] <Blondie101010> you need to start by knowing what you want to do and THEN figure out how to do it
[01:48:10] <chazy> lets see if it makes sense, one json with purchases (paid) and one json with already sent (sent), does that not make sense?
[01:48:19] <Blondie101010> I strongly suggest you solve it with a plain foreach loop first
[01:49:29] <Blondie101010> you go through the array you want to shorten

[01:50:27] <da_wunder> looks like your json isn't valid at all
[01:52:07] <chazy> hmm its a copy paste
[01:52:19] <tirnanog> it's invalid because of the extraneous comma at the end of the array that is the value of the result key.
[01:52:42] <chazy> wait, you mean the one from the example or the one from bscscan, this one? https://gist.github.com/ChazyTheBest/a1e4aaf0bf92a890afffa21c2dacf73d

[04:36:56] <Blondie101010> ok
[04:39:09] <chazy> someone please help me understand this: i have a list of payments, and then a list of users i already sent what they paid for, i ran array_udiff(payments,sent, fn ($a,$b) => $a->compare <=> $b->compare); and the result count is not payments minus sent, why's that?
[04:40:21] <chazy> payments has 402 objects, sent has 205 objects, and the diff result array has 185, where are the other 12 objects from payments that are not in sent?
[04:40:54] <__adrian> you'd need to look at how you're comparing, and at the actual data
[04:42:14] <chazy> the original lists have payments->from and sent-to, so i created a new array for each where i create a new property for each object named compare = from and compare = to, so array_udiff() can work as expected
[04:42:40] <chazy> what do i have to check now?
[04:42:58] <__adrian> mmmm
[04:43:08] <__adrian> so you're not comparing the actual arrays in question?
[04:43:19] <__adrian> why would you need to create an intermediate array?
[04:43:47] <chazy> because the payment objetcs and sent objects have the inner condition with a different property name
[04:44:01] <chazy> payment->from === sent->to
[04:44:03] <__adrian> why is that a problem?

[04:52:24] <__adrian> hm. i was not aware it did that.
[04:52:52] <__adrian> but note, by mapping to an intermediate array, you're only hiding the error. you're completely ignoring the problem that's causing the error
[04:53:10] <chazy> i thought that was the error
[04:53:45] <__adrian> what's that error telling you? if $a->to is not defined, what does that imply about $a?
[04:53:57] <chazy> i can show you the code and both lists, cuz i don't see any error
[04:54:18] <__adrian> i'm talking about the error you just showed me
[04:54:23] <chazy> oh ok
[04:54:24] <__adrian> > Undefined property: Purchase::$to
[04:54:39] <chazy> it's trying to find the property name in the other object?
[04:54:47] <__adrian> yes
[04:55:09] <__adrian> changing them to all be the same names won't solve that underlying problem. in fact, it just confuses things further.
[04:55:18] <chazy> so, the name is irrelevant, it can be anything, what matter is the value which is the inner join condition
[04:55:29] <chazy> is my assumption wrong?
[04:55:37] <__adrian> the underlying problem is we might be comparing A vs. B, A vs. A, B vs. B
[04:55:51] <chazy> no, we're comparing addresses
[04:56:11] <chazy> does the name of the variable that contains the address matter?
[04:56:24] <__adrian> yes, because it exists on some objects and not others
[04:56:26] <chazy> i may be wrong, though, not sure at this point
[04:56:30] <__adrian> https://3v4l.org/W8pO2
[04:56:52] <__adrian> this is my mistake from yesterday. i did not know array_*diff did this.
[04:56:52] <chazy> hmm isn't that because there are more payment objetcs than delivered objects?
[04:56:56] <__adrian> no
[04:57:59] <__adrian> it's because the algo array_*diff uses doesn't compare objects naively. e.g., if it compares  1:2 and 1 is less, then compares 2:3 and 2 is less, it won't compare 1:3 because it's already obvious that 1 is less.
[04:58:11] <__adrian> because 1:2:3
[04:58:42] <__adrian> so yes, it will compare purchase:purchase, purchase:delivery, delivery:delivery
[04:59:01] <__adrian> sorry about misleading you there. i didn't realize/remember it worked this way.
[04:59:40] <chazy> np
[05:00:06] <chazy> so should i just go back to nesting foreachs?
[05:00:18] <__adrian> nah, see my W8pO2 above
[05:01:07] <chazy> perfect, no need to recreate the arrays
[05:01:11] <__adrian> just modify the comparison to accept either type (purchases OR deliveries)
[05:01:16] <__adrian> y
[05:02:38] <chazy> hmm the objetcs both have from and to, it's just that i don't want to mix them
[05:02:46] <__adrian> then  instanceof
[05:03:29] <chazy> the inner join is purchase->from === delivery->to, it shouldn't use purchase->to or delivery->from
[05:04:35] <chazy> i mean both have from and to, it's just i didn't put them in the example to simplify and that's why it errors in the example and not when i execute the script
[05:04:55] <chazy> so, what it returns is 100% not what i need
[05:04:58] <__adrian> https://3v4l.org/PAotv
[05:05:47] <__adrian> use  instanceof  to check types and decide which to compare againsnt
[05:06:00] <chazy> yes, that makes sense
[05:06:07] <chazy> thanks!
[05:06:12] <__adrian> np
[05:26:44] <Blondie101010> if they're mutually exclusive properties, I'd be tempted to $aVal = $a->from ?? $a->to;

[19:57:30] <jhave> Hello
[19:57:58] <Rockwood> o/
[20:03:23] <jhave> It's been years since I've been serious about my PHP development, have had more focus on the server operation part but would like to get started again. But a lot has happened since then. I have previously used a VM with Linux on my LAN as a development server but there are good alternatives today as a docker and my thought was a bit to use some WSL2 / Docker environment. But is it a go or no go
[20:03:23] <jhave> for developing small PHP projects?
[20:05:16] <jhave> I use Windows as desktop and Linux for servers :)
[20:06:02] <__adrian> docker/wsl2 are good windows choices, yes
[20:06:18] <__adrian> (a VM is still just fine too)
[20:06:34] <__adrian> docker just tends to be more manageable

[20:16:29] <jhave> What about the PHP code its best to keep on a Windows drive and load it in WSL2 from the /mnt/drive/ path or its better to keep it in the home folder like ~/Projects/ in WSL2 ?
[20:17:00] <jhave> My plain is to use Git and Github for it :)
[20:17:14] <Rockwood> __adrian, hi how are you sir?
[20:17:38] <jhave> Sorry all my stupid questions
[20:18:03] <jhave> Just seek for some advice before i begin :)
[20:21:13] <Naktibalda> jhave: keep it inside WSL2 and access it via \\wsl$    , performance was horrible when I used mounted Windows dir
[20:21:54] <__adrian> jhave: i don't use windows, but whatever's convenient to you. yes, definitely use git. github... up to you
[20:24:05] <Rockwood> __adrian, professionally companies use git?
[20:24:20] <__adrian> Rockwood: yes, of course
[20:24:34] <Rockwood> for huge level applications?
[20:24:46] <__adrian> of course
[20:25:05] <__adrian> it was invented for the linux kernel, you know  ;)
[20:25:37] <Rockwood> in case of security of code?
[20:26:31] <__adrian> what?
[20:27:39] <Rockwood> i means code hide from others

[20:28:12] <__adrian> git is for version control
[20:28:41] <Rockwood> no i means github
[20:28:51] <Blondie101010> you put it in a private repository if required / applicable
[20:29:00] <__adrian> ^
[20:29:12] <__adrian> you're trusting github, but it's not _in_secure
[20:30:13] <Rockwood> ah okay
[20:30:25] <Rockwood> yes private option also there
[20:31:04] <jhave> There are good alternativs to github like gitlab
[20:31:27] <Nekomander> jhave, also, make yourself familiar with using a utility called Composer ( https://getcomposer.org/ ) if you hadn't already done so. Remember the old days for whenever we want to add that cool Library or other Third-Party PHP scripts, we would have to go to http://some-php-script-vendor.com/ to download that .zip file, extract it, and then hook it up, integrate that into our own PHP code?  No need to do that anymore. We use the utility to download
[20:31:29] <Nekomander> php scripts, and it SEAMLESSLY (and automatically) becomes available for our PHP code, all downloaded scripts are Neatly stored inside the folder named "vendor", and it stays out of our way while we do our work.
[20:31:40] <__adrian> note also you don't NEED github (or an alternative)
[20:32:21] <jhave> I think the first PHP version i work with was 4.x
[20:32:30] <jhave> Its some days ago
[20:32:51] <jhave> Yes composer do some nice stuff :)
[20:37:07] <Nekomander> jhave, this is possible, Because our "main php script" (e.g. index.php) file uses the `include` keyword to include composer's PHP file named `autoload.php` and we take advantage of PHP's feature called Autoloading. - https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.spl-autoload-register.php
[20:37:51] <Nekomander> Hi Rockwood. As pointed out, you don't need github, you dont need an alternative to use Git.
[20:38:33] <Nekomander> You can have your git repository on your server. No, you do not need a special program for this. Just upload the git repository, DONE. That's it.
[20:40:47] <jhave> I can see there are a new function to show \\$wsl in the explore but its not on my installation

[20:49:54] <Naktibalda> jhave: true, I forgot what it is a few times, a good thing is that if I create a PhpStorm project in \\wsl$  it remembers where the project is, so I don't have to.
[20:50:55] <Naktibalda> tip #5, use PhpStorm as IDE
[20:52:23] <TinoDidriksen> \\wsl$ exists? I've been using WSL since it came out, and even looked for something like \\wsl$ every so often, but never found anything like it so I just used the full path into %APPDATA% instead.
