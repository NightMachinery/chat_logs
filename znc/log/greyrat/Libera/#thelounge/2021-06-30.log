[03:07:04] <blaklistd> How do I forward lounge's docker to caddy's docker 443?
[03:07:51] <blaklistd> Public 443 > caddy docker > lounge docker 
[03:12:08] <bookworm> blaklistd: you don't need to run thelounge on 443, any other port works
[03:12:48] <bookworm> there are multiple ways, you could for example make the thelounge container only accessible by the caddy container via a docker specfic network
[03:13:45] <bookworm> but even if you keep it on the host net, just let caddy listen on 443 and thelounge on something like 6697 and point caddy at that port
[03:14:35] <blaklistd> ok 
[03:14:40] <blaklistd> that's what I did
[03:14:47] <blaklistd> lounge is on 9000
[03:15:04] <blaklistd> reverse proxy set up for that
[03:15:16] <blaklistd> but only works if caddy is installed as a binary
[03:15:20] <blaklistd> not docker
[03:15:26] <blaklistd> bookworm: 
[03:15:39] <bookworm> well, how did you configure docker? How do you run the containers?
[03:15:45] <blaklistd> compose
[03:15:54] <bookworm> but honestly we left #thelounge territory here, there's ##docker I guess
[03:16:19] <bookworm> ah, #docker, my bad

[03:51:20] <eliocamp> I've created about 250 users, for our conference. Now it's starting to run very slow. Takes a lot of time to load the sign-in page and then it's not very responsive. I'm monitoring the server and it's not at all under high load. RAM is at 2.5gb out of 31gb and the 8 cores are hardly being used. Should I be worried?
[03:52:06] <eliocamp> (users are all idle)

[03:53:02] <bookworm> eliocamp: fire up a profiler maybe? Not sure anyone ever tried to stress test the number of users
[03:53:21] <bookworm> if it's a very specific bottleneck maybe it could be prevented

[03:58:29] <eliocamp> Mh.. I don't know how to do that ðŸ˜…  , but I'll ask my teammates. 
[04:06:18] <bookworm> eliocamp: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/simple-profiling/ + https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/diagnostics-flamegraph/
[04:08:45] <eliocamp> Does that work if we've installed from deb?
[04:09:09] <bookworm> as for your 8 cores, isn't js single threaded by design?
[04:10:31] <bookworm> yes and no, the invocation would differ a bit, point node  at the location of the thelounge script (`node $whatever_flags_you_need $(which thelounge)`) or something along those lines
[04:12:29] <eliocamp> I think it's 8 cores because that's the machine type offered by google cloud.

[04:20:23] <alyx> I didn't see anything in the issue tracker, but just checking, is it known that thelounge seems to eat /links output?
[04:21:56] <bookworm> what's "/links"
[04:23:28] <alyx> it shows a list of servers connected to the network, e.g.  https://dpaste.org/pWrs, LINKS command is defined here https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1459#section-4.3.3
[04:23:58] <eliocamp> bookworm on a hunch I disabled logs globaly and restarted the service. Now it works fine! I'm not sure exactly what it means, usage-wise to not have logs. 
[04:24:15] <bookworm> logs as in text or sqlite?
[04:24:19] <eliocamp> btoh
[04:24:21] <eliocamp> both*
[04:24:43] <bookworm> no scrollback if you restart essentially
[04:24:54] <eliocamp> I I restart The lounge, right?
[04:25:07] <bookworm> during your conference?
[04:25:12] <bookworm> hopefully not
[04:25:23] <eliocamp> Yeah, hopefully not. It will take hours to reconnect every user!
[04:25:51] <eliocamp> We still have +H enabled by default in our channels, which should still give us history. 
[04:34:51] <eliocamp> Ok, it was definetly the logs. Now it's running smooth as slik. 
[04:36:08] <eliocamp> Now to test if the problem was sqlite or text
[04:36:52] <bookworm> text logs won't be useful for the users as they don't have shell access I assume?
[04:37:06] <eliocamp> Nope. 
[04:38:14] <eliocamp> At first I thought they could be useful in case of a code of condut violation, but the CoC team decided that they weren't going to look at logs. 
[04:42:51] <eliocamp> Using only sqlite logs was better, but still a bit sluggish when changing channels. Still some intermittent disconnects and eventual delays between sending a message and it appearing on screen. 
[04:49:04] <eliocamp> Using only text logs is even better. It seems that sqlite was the main culprit
[04:49:40] <eliocamp> And memory footprint is much less! Down to 1gb!
[04:50:35] <knolle> sqlite isn't really made for 250 users
[04:50:54] <eliocamp> Now I know.

[15:24:27] <fnutt> dgw: Fixed that issue with <> in the urls.
[15:24:34] <fnutt> dgw: I assume the idea of better urls is to make it a lot more easy to have predefined servers and channels just from url when linking, ergo it has to use network host (not just the network name).
[15:26:05] <bookworm> well, we have a standard for that with irc:// links
[15:27:39] <bookworm> and TL can already be set as a protocol handler for those
[15:28:19] <bookworm> we could improve the handling there to pretty much achieve most usecases
[15:50:02] <fnutt> Sure sure... but it's not always you are using IRC on your own personal computer/phone where you can set The Lounge to handle irc;// links.

[21:38:35] <MaxLeiter> bookworm: one downside to using irc:// links is it requires users to opt-in. For use cases like conferences that's not ideal 
[21:41:37] <bookworm> right. On the plus side if someone is a techy and wants to use weechat they can with irc links as they can register their own client as handler
[21:41:42] <bookworm> pros and cons
[21:42:39] <MaxLeiter> but they can already do that
[21:43:02] <MaxLeiter> Oh, I see what you mean
[21:43:14] <bookworm> if we use pur own special snowflake link? No
[21:43:45] <bookworm> that's the point of url scheme handlers
