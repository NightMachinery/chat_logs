But a far-reaching restructuring in 2010, which included a management buyout of both founders Michael

Brown declined to be interviewed for this feature, saying via e-mail simply that "we've all just moved on really, and I prefer to look forward." "We had to change pretty much the entire company from the bottom upwards to turn Team17 into a sustainable business, achieving year-on-year
[03:26:36] <feepbot> profitability and growth," Bestwick says. Indeed, Team17 didn't turn a profit at all in the first decade of the century. "I brought in a very smart guy, Paul Bray, from outside of games on the operations and financial side, and I can definitely say it was the best decision I‚Äôve ever made," says Bestwick.

[05:21:55] <quanticle> gwern: I don't know, apparently some Chinese propaganda (like stories about Chinese heroics in the Korean war) is supposed to be not bad
[05:22:37] <gwern> maybe in another 10 years... although Xi has been killing the chinese movie industry with tax evasion investigations and unpersoning any actors who get too popular, so we'll see
[05:22:38] <quanticle> Isn't flat design old news by now? 
[05:22:49] <gwern> I've begun to wonder if china has very abruptly hit the middle income trap
[05:23:39] <gwern> you know, their per capita GDP is still incredibly low
[05:24:42] <saturn2> quanticle: it would be if we still had trends, but it seems like that's kind of over
[05:24:50] <gwern> it's like $13k. and meanwhile, Xi is killing the most successful industries, terrifying the rich entrepreneurs, disappearing any one as famous as him, their population size has just about peaked so the demographic dividend is now goign to start being paid back with interest...
[05:25:27] <gwern> hell, even japan at least managed to crack $20k per capita before their lost decades
[05:26:15] <quanticle> gwern: re: "Unintended Consequences for Improving Opportunity for Immigrant Girls" my reaction is, "One more step in economists, slowly, painfully learning how to be human"
[05:26:16] <gwern> (taiwan / south korea is at ~$31k now for comparison)
[05:28:59] <gwern> and then you have how everything keeps getting shut down for covid suppression I wonder if we are going to look back and see that as Peak CCP. and then it's just long lost decades in a typically east asian fashion as their population stagnates and declines
[05:29:44] <gwern> pulled along by the global economy and development, maybe eventually hitting $20k per capita
[05:30:22] <gwern> india but a lot richer
[05:31:25] <saturn2> damn it gwern you're ruining my cold war 2 fantasies
[05:31:50] <gwern> hey, if upper volga with nukes could run a cold war, surely 'mexico but squintier eyes' can run a second one
[05:32:14] <quanticle> Yeah, China's GDP got a lot closer to the US' than Russia's ever did
[05:32:27] <quanticle> And the Russkies still managed to stay in the game for 70 years!
[05:32:31] <gwern> china already has the nukes too
[05:33:17] <gwern> * Upper Volta
[05:33:33] <gwern> better known as burkina faso now, apparently
[05:33:51] <quanticle> Upper Volta is Burkina Faso?
[05:34:32] <gwern> yeah. I was sure it was 'upper volga' because that's in the right place, abut no, it's 'upper volta' and I'd just never heard of 'upper volta' because it stopped existing a long time ago
[05:36:31] <quanticle> That said, I have to disagree with, "How everything is getting shut down for covid suppression," and my impression is that the shutdowns are by no means a normal routine thing. From what Westerners in China (or Westerners with connections to China) are reporting, it's like life is normal 90% of the time. No mask mandates, etc, life proceeds as normal. Then, when authorities find a COVID case,
[05:36:33] <quanticle> things lock down hard, but for a limited period of time.
[05:36:36] <quanticle> Then then things go back to normal
[05:37:00] <quanticle> I'm sure there is some effect on GDP, but I don't think it's actually that bad. I'd be shocked if it were even a 1% loss
[05:37:05] <gwern> they're shutting down ports and international travel, that's having a lot of ripple effects
[05:37:32] <gwern> and it's discouraging any kind of entrepreneuraliship or investment because  it's sending yet another message from xi to businesses: "eat shit and die"
[05:38:21] <quanticle> Shutting down ports, yes, but international travel, I'm not sure. That might even be resulting in a net increase in GDP. Not a lot of tourists go to China, but Chinese tourists went everywhere. Now that they can't travel overseas, they're spending their yuan renminbi at home.
[05:38:40] <gwern> and it just has no end in sight. there is no exit plan. it's an authoritarian ditatorship. it can do this as long as it wants to
[05:38:42] <quanticle> And the discouraging of entrepreneurship is something that you can't attribute to COVID
[05:38:57] <quanticle> That's something that Xi was starting even before the pandemic
[05:39:23] <gwern> covid appears to've massively expanded the state control in pretty much every way
[05:39:31] <quanticle> Yes
[05:39:53] <nshepperd2> Obormot\Arcturus: this is what we pay graphic designers the big bucks for
[05:39:56] <gwern> and they're running out of time in the bigger sense of demographic trends too. every year they are flat, that's one year gone from their donut hole of opportunity to ever get near even south korea/taiwan GDP
[05:40:26] <quanticle> But I think Xi telling businesses to eat shit and die is something that would have happened anyway, COVID or no. It's not like he needed the extra control that COVID gave him to slap Jack Ma around or shut down the test prep companies. He could have done that even before.
[05:40:44] <gwern> I think of it as a rachet
[05:41:02] <gwern> covid clicked the ratchet several years' worth
[05:41:07] <quanticle> Perhaps
[05:41:54] <gwern> everything points to the creation and embrace of their current mediocrity as safe
[05:41:56] <quanticle> Oh, speaking of ratchets, I got to use the screwdriver I bought for my dad last Father's Day. It has this neat ratcheting mechanism that causes the bit to turn in one direction regardless of which way you're turning the handle.
[05:42:23] <nshepperd2> oh yeah, we've got one of those
[05:42:27] <quanticle> So you advance the screw on both the forward and the return
[05:43:02] <nshepperd2> it has a switch you can set to three positions to ratchet either direction, or lock the ratchet so its just a regular screwdriver
[05:43:16] <gwern> the SOEs are only getting bigger, the private entities are being allowed to or made to fail... dan wang may be super optimistic but I think he's in a china high-tech bubble
[05:44:13] <quanticle> I don't think you can lock the ratchet on this one, it ratchets forward or it ratchets backward: https://www.craftsman.com/products/hand-tools/screwdrivers/cmht68129--15-pc-speeddrive-ratcheting-multi-bit-screwdriver-set

[05:44:16] <gwern> (if right now china were entering its lost decades, how would it look different than it does?)
[05:46:09] <quanticle> Yeah, but at the same time, India doesn't look that much like China, and four out of the last 5 decades for India have been "lost"
[05:46:28] <nshepperd2> quanticle: wait it turns forward on the *return*? is this a two hander thing or something
[05:46:34] <quanticle> Like, yeah, the economic liberalism boosted things for about ten years, but then things settled back down again into the "Hindu rate of growth"
[05:46:58] <quanticle> nshepperd2: Yeah, if you grip the knurled section, it turns forward on the return
[05:47:16] <nshepperd2> huh
[05:47:56] <nshepperd2> and it ratchets normally in one handed mode?
[05:48:31] <quanticle> Yeah, but, as I said earlier, you can't lock it to be a normal screwdriver
[05:48:54] <nshepperd2> cool
[05:49:15] <PlanckWalk> Eh, from what I can see in the news, China's lockdowns affect a far smaller fraction of the population that any of Australia's did
[05:49:37] <PlanckWalk> And where I live, we had a few weeks of lockdown total for the whole pandemic to date
[05:49:45] <PlanckWalk> Pretty negligible.
[05:50:13] <gwern> quanticle: I mean in the sense of an authoritarian state which has a superficially vibrant private sector but actually basically all government-controlled, with accordingly low growth rates and which will be stuck in middle/low-income traps for the foreseeable future, a geopolitical force only because they can extract money from *so* many people
[05:50:39] <gwern> quanticle: but you would not put India in the same bucket as, say, the USA
[05:51:36] <quanticle> No, I wouldn't. But if Xi were to die or step down, his successor could reliberalize and return China to growth.
[05:51:41] <quanticle> I'm not sure that could work in India
[05:52:16] <gwern> a lot of people have a certain implicit mental model where they extrapolate china forward and figure that ok, by, I dunno, 2040, it'll basically be equivalent to the USA per capita but far far larger and so far more powerful. but I'm looking at these trends and that doesn't seem like it's going to happen. I'm increasingly unsure if it'll even match the USA - the USA still has like 6x the per...
[05:52:22] <gwern> ...capita
[05:52:58] <PlanckWalk> The only way they'll match US GDP per capita is if/when the US drops substantially.
[05:53:30] <gwern> (and having many fewer people makes the USA potentially much more agile or able to focus on things like leading edge tech)
[05:54:05] <gwern> I'm still a little shocked that it's only $13k. for some reason I was thinking >$20k
[05:56:16] <gwern> $13k is... a bad place to end your industrial revolution & demographic transition
[05:56:29] <quanticle> And by the same token, that should be a rebuke to the people who think that the decline in population growth is a bad thing!
[05:57:03] <gwern> they'd probably just say 'good, it's china's turn'
[05:57:16] <quanticle> I see them on Twitter, arguing that declining population means declining innovation. Well, if that were the case, why did China ever fall behind in the first place?
[05:57:42] <quanticle> Why did a poor-ass depopulated backwater like Britain turn into a world-spanning empire?
[05:58:08] <gwern> if we knew that, we'd turn everywhere into scandinavia. increasing populations is a lot easier by comparison
[05:58:15] <quanticle> Yeah
[06:00:32] <gwern> (once we get AGI, of course, the AGIs will do both)
[06:01:02] <PlanckWalk> US spends more on housing and health care than China spends total.
[06:01:21] <PlanckWalk> (per person, I mean)
[06:02:09] <quanticle> Yeah, the US is fucking *rich*
[06:02:38] <quanticle> I've said before, when we went to Italy, my mom looked around Rome was like, "This place feels... kinda poor"
[06:03:05] <gwern> I think all the people who are always spazzing out for the latest third world dictatorship to industrialize and 'show an alternative to neoliberalism' really don't appreciate how wealthy the US is and how utterly far even 'successes' like china or japan are
[06:05:27] <quanticle> While we're on the topic of neoliberalism, London definitely felt richer than Paris, but I don't know if that's because of neoliberalism or the Nazis

[09:57:08] <feepbot> feep[work]: feep left a note 1 days, 10 hours ago: buy trash bags
[09:57:21] <feep[work]> there is literally a classifier in our brains that assigns personal identity to sensory data
[09:57:47] <feep[work]> our self-awareness is an extension of this classifier
[10:00:31] <saturn2> isn't that a well-known theory?
[10:00:44] <feep[work]> is it? neat!
[10:00:53] <adiabatic> feep[work]: that's why we make up gods for the rain and shit?

[10:02:08] <feep[work]> interesting extension
[10:02:22] <feep[work]> the feeling of "being in control of your life" is literally perceiving your identity in your environment.
[10:02:49] <feep[work]> that's why people undertake visible agentic actions to reinforce it.
[10:03:17] <adiabatic> sounds like emacs users tweaking their emacs config

[10:20:45] <nshepperd2> feep[work]: can you give an example of such sensory data
[10:32:59] <feep[work]> nshepperd2: I mean, it's literally a sensory primitive.
[10:33:13] <feep[work]> nshepperd2: for evidence, compare idioms like "This has FOO's fingerprints all over it."
[10:33:52] <feep[work]> I'm arguing that when we're saying things like that, we're literally reporting an immediate qualia.
[10:34:22] <feep[work]> I also think this is the qualia that breaks in depersonalization and that thing where you stop identifying parts of your body as your own
[10:35:09] <feep[work]> (and possibly the same thing that is offline when we're imagining something.)
[10:36:01] <nshepperd2> i don't get it
[10:36:49] <feep[work]> like, you have eyesight, hearing, touch, heatsense, sense of balance, taste, smell, ...... and I'm saying that this list continues "..., identity sense"
[10:37:33] <feep[work]> I mean, it's not a sense in the sense of nerves leading into the brain, but I think there's synthetic senses
[10:37:46] <feep[work]> stuff that your brain generates internally but feeds into the qualia mechanism all the same
[10:39:09] <feep[work]> like, if you take an image of ... like, a widower looking at his wife's bedroom in the apartment, then I think you can imagine ... like, his perception having a "quality of perceived identity of other" in it that you can remove and end up with a very different perception
[10:39:50] <nshepperd2> hm i see
[10:39:52] <feep[work]> I think that relates to the way in which we absorb tools into our own identity through use, I think we can do that for others' tools as well
[10:40:18] <nshepperd2> i agree that i have a thing that classifies stuff in my world model as me/not me
[10:41:04] <nshepperd2> idk that it would classify sensory data per se, that sounds weird
[10:41:19] <feep[work]> well, it's a semantic debate
[10:41:27] <feep[work]> I agree that it's not a sense in the classical sense of data reported by a distinct organ
[10:41:30] <Robomot> [Astral Codex Ten] Open Thread 210 - https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/open-thread-210
[10:41:55] <feep[work]> but I think it's a sense in the sense of category of perception
[10:42:11] <nshepperd2> everything that seems like a seperate axis to what i said
[10:42:20] <feep[work]> the point is that I don't think it's system-two inferred
[10:42:23] <nshepperd2> s/everything//
[10:42:59] <feep[work]> I mean to expand, I think there's lots of sensations like that, like parsimony/elegance
[10:43:19] <feep[work]> symmetry* maybe
[10:43:32] <feep[work]> nshepperd2: I mean, you know the kiki/bouba thing, right?
[10:43:40] <feep[work]> is that a qualia? it's a qualia, right?
[10:43:58] <feep[work]> I think that's a good basic example of what I called a synthetic sensation
[10:44:09] <nshepperd2> idk, is it
[10:44:13] <feep[work]> it is for me
[10:44:15] <adiabatic> what part of the kiki/bouba thing is a qualia? I don't really understand what 'qualia' means‚Ä¶
[10:44:16] <feep[work]> kiki feels sharp
[10:44:28] <feep[work]> adiabatic: qualia is just a primitive sensory impression
[10:44:38] <feep[work]> or rather, a categorization of a sensory input
[10:44:55] <adiabatic> That makes WAY more sense than any of the other definitions I've ever seen. Thank you.
[10:44:59] <feep[work]> your skin senses temperature, but your brain senses things like "scalding" or "freezing". that's qualia.
[10:45:55] <feep[work]> adiabatic: like, if you consider something like "the ineffable redness of red", you can think of the mental category of red as a tag slapped onto the rgb inputs your brain processes
[10:46:07] <feep[work]> but then, if you look at something like "spiky" or "sharp" or "dangerous"
[10:46:23] <feep[work]> those are not direct reports from the eye data, they're "pre-chewed/pre-parsed visual data"
[10:46:24] <adiabatic> I'm trying to evaluate whether "qualia of mercy" make sense or not, and my hunch is‚Ä¶it's confused; what it feels like to be mercied is way different from the qualia of being merciful
[10:46:30] <feep[work]> that's a different sense
[10:46:56] <adiabatic> yeah, I suspect my understanding of the term is being thrown out of whack by someone's username
[10:47:08] <feep[work]> XD
[10:47:30] <feep[work]> https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia/#Uses plato has a good intro
[10:47:31] <Robomot> Qualia (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
[10:49:16] <nshepperd2> theres the qualia of looking at a fanart of mercy from overwatch
[10:49:33] <feep[work]> hehe
[10:49:45] <feep[work]> well, that seems a stretch as a primitive
[10:49:57] <feep[work]> weeehhhh then again if we count identity-sense...??
[10:50:07] <adiabatic> wouldn't you get way different qualia depending on her pose, what (if) she's wearing (anything), and what you think of hot blonde Swiss chicks?
[10:50:13] <feep[work]> maybe there really is a primitive qualia for "a character being mercy from overwatch"
[10:50:23] <feep[work]> adiabatic: usually any sensory frame of perception contains many, many qualia
[10:50:34] <adiabatic> ok, that make sense.
[10:50:56] <nshepperd2> clearly your brain allocates a new kernel handle whenever you meet someone new
[10:51:05] <feep[work]> this but unironically
[10:51:28] <feep[work]> like, that's my theory now: that is literally what happens.
[10:52:03] <feep[work]> betcha money there's literally a feature vector for selecting people in there.
[10:52:27] <feep[work]> .. then again, that seems like the sort of bet that can only be settled after the singularity, at which point money will be irrelevant

[11:39:54] <feep[work]> bildramer: I have to restart it occasionally for understandable reasons that will be fixed
[11:40:04] <galambo__> kuudes, thats a race not a list no?
[11:40:16] <feep[work]> ie. I used to just have it set up wrong cause I didn't read the very large printed update notes (it's gentoo, this is my own fault)
[11:40:31] <kuudes> its a famous 500?
[11:40:32] <feep[work]> and then rn it occasionally has issues picking up my usb soundcard when I switch my kvm, but again, that's my own fault
[11:40:35] <feep[work]> probably
[11:40:36] <feep[work]> somehow
[11:40:39] <kuudes> oh, there was "list" in the end, ok
[11:40:51] <kuudes> 500 under 500, is there such
[11:40:51] <feep[work]> bildramer: but the amount of *inexplicable* issues is way lower.
[11:41:07] <feep[work]> for instance, occasionally pulseaudio used to just fall into a mode where it stuttered and kept stuttering forever
[11:41:17] <feep[work]> I have never had this happen with pipewire.
[11:41:59] <feep[work]> and ofc the bluetooth support is just plain better out of the gate, pulseaudio bluetooth is some sort of cthonic horror involving, for some reason, modem drivers
[11:42:22] <bildramer> lol what
[11:42:26] <feep[work]> ikr!

[12:19:54] <feep[work]> good question, feels like it should exist
[12:19:55] <synthmeat> wait. maybe not. bt latency is mostly software, right?
[12:20:05] <bildramer> bt latency is invisible gremlins
[12:20:12] <bildramer> they love the taste of packets

[12:24:53] <feep[work]> I don't think it's related to near/far at all, it's using some packetized format so if I lose connection I lose it completely
[12:25:03] <feep[work]> there's pure radio ones, but eh
[12:25:19] <synthmeat> pure radio is mostly used in live concerts, where needed, from what i see
[12:25:20] <feep[work]> anyway, given radio propagation speed, near/far receiver just has zero effect

[13:00:58] <saturn2> the trouble is it tried to be all things to all people and ended up so complicated no one can figure out how to implement it correctly
[13:01:05] <kuudes> have fountain codes come out of patent yet?
[13:01:32] <kuudes> I presume patent thingies could also matter, apple won't pay for those usually
[13:02:55] <saturn2> fountain codes don't avoid the latency problem
[13:03:12] <synthmeat> having an option to disable buffer would be sweet
[13:03:30] <synthmeat> udp of bt
[13:03:53] <saturn2> they avoid needing an acknowledge/retransmit mechanism but you still need a buffer to play during the gap
[13:05:30] <feep[work]> fountain codes instead have a patent problem
[13:10:36] <nshepperd> fountain codes instead waste tons of channel capacity on stuff the other end has already received
[13:13:51] <PapuaHardyNet> is this information theory?
[13:13:58] <synthmeat> yup
[13:14:04] <feep[work]> fountain codes should calibrate to channel loss rate
[13:14:35] <feep[work]> at any rate, for audio it really doesn't matter
[13:15:24] <feep[work]> since required capacity is constant and there's only one consumer
[13:18:19] <kuudes> how do mobile phones solve the latency issue?
[13:18:42] <synthmeat> they don't?
[13:19:47] <kuudes> it seems people are able to use mobile calls
[13:20:53] <synthmeat> you just don't notice it in that use case? perception of rhythm is much more precise.
[13:21:24] <saturn2> they don't try to support low latency and cd-quality audio at the same time
[13:22:24] <saturn2> with support for every codec invented since 1990
[13:22:57] <saturn2> just look at this page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bluetooth_profiles
[13:22:57] <Robomot> List of Bluetooth profiles - Wikipedia (In order to use Bluetooth, a device must be compatible with the subset of Bluetooth profiles (often called services or functions) necessary to use the desired services. A Bluetooth profile is a specification regarding an aspect of Bluetooth-based wireless communication between devices. It resides on top of the Bluetooth Core Specification and (optionally) additional ‚Ä¶)
[13:24:50] <saturn2> this is possibly the most absurd thing humans have ever invented
[13:32:47] <feep[work]> anyway, pipewire faq says it's trying to be better about latency than pulse
[13:34:51] <kuudes> I guess this relates to my memory of drm problems https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bluetooth_profiles#Advanced_Audio_Distribution_Profile_(A2DP)

[13:34:58] <kuudes> "Some Bluetooth stacks enforce the SCMS-T digital rights management (DRM) scheme. In these cases, it is impossible to connect certain A2DP headphones for high quality audio, while some vendors disable the A2DP functionality altogether to avoid devices rejecting A2DP sink. "
[13:36:55] <kuudes> yeah, a true gamer would use something that produces very low audio quality and id the different white noises by ear to match different game signals

[15:34:25] <PapuaHardyNet> okay - the dense layer weights matrix is dc, and the input is ...c, and you do a matmul along the "c" axis, and then sum over that axis

[17:41:05] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : : Network approaches for analyzing narratives and other texts are being used with increasing frequency. They are seen as capable of identifying key actors and events, highlighting semantic structures, and uncovering underlying meanings and mental models. Numerous network approaches exist. In this paper, we adopt an approach where the characters in the story are nodes and the ties linking indicate some type of interaction 
[17:41:05] <two2thehead> between them. We use it to explore the effects of tie strength between members of two ‚Äúdark networks‚Äù found in the Harry Potter novels ‚Äî Dumbledore‚Äôs Army and Voldemort‚Äôs Death Eaters. Drawing on centrality measures, our analysis finds that a handful of secondary characters play roles as important, or almost as important, as Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort. Moreover, our comparison of the topographical structure of the two
[17:41:06] <two2thehead>  networks suggests that if the fictional world of Harry Potter remotely mirrors the real one, Dumbledore‚Äôs Army is built to withstand stress and uncertainty, while the Death Eaters is not, suggesting that that J. K. Rowling has an intuitive understanding of a key difference between networks built on trust and those built on fear. The former live to fight another day; the latter do not. 
[17:41:59] <two2thehead> tl;dr the Death Eaters are more centralized and thus less resilient, dumbledore's army is more resilient, probably due to higher median level of trust between nodes
[17:42:49] <two2thehead> I'm actually quite impressed with this analysis
[17:43:17] <two2thehead> I knew Jinny was a potential second or in a pinch a leader, but there are names I hadn't even considered for secondary positions
[17:43:34] <two2thehead> Ginny*
[17:43:46] <PapuaHardyNet> none of this matters because Harry was the Master of Death and that was the only reason he won
[17:43:47] <two2thehead> it's been a decade since I've read the books

[21:52:18] <PapuaHardyNet> just to verify, model parallelism involves putting layers of models in different devices, while LM-Megatron / tensor parallelism involves putting *parts of layers* of models in different devices?
[21:52:43] <PapuaHardyNet> and to make this efficient, you try to reduce the synchronization necessary between each layer
[21:53:35] <PapuaHardyNet> so this is only possible with mostly embarrassingly parallel architectures
[21:57:00] <gwern> sounds about right. data parallelism: entire model on a single gpu; model parallelism: some layers on a single GPU; tensor parallelism: some of some layers on a single gpu (at which point there's not really any way to slice more finely, and it's just even more tensor parallelism)

[22:49:14] <two2thehead> feep, I bet he'd be amazing at shadow puppetry
[22:49:16] <feep> no, but the arms may be put on trial separately
[22:49:40] <feep> anyway, now this is a bit of a stretch, but the core question is - *assuming* that the arms are not AI, because why would you give tentacle arms AI
[22:49:49] <feep> why would an inhibitor chip help?
[22:50:10] <feep> answer: the arms have overtuned proprioceptive sense strength.
[22:50:24] <gwern> I think you'd want some low-level AI for the same reason as octopus tentacles have their own 'NI' if you will - latency and obsverability
[22:50:25] <feep> they're an identity superstimulus.
[22:50:50] <feep> but otto octavius does not have tentacle arms in his body map
[22:51:09] <feep> so these arms, which strongly assert that they are in my locus of control, are not part of me
[22:51:37] <feep> consequentially his poor confused brain maps them to his *rejected self*, his shadow.
[22:52:20] <feep> gwern: I mean, in the movie he has *conversations* with them.
