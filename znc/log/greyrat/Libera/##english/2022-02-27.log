[07:34:29] <bullgard4> I am looking for an English or American word and cannot find it. The subject is health or well-being. When bicycling in the cold and having inadequately dressed my neck, the cold air or wind may cause a pain in my muscles which move (turn or nod) my head. What is the medical term for that? I only found the tanslations: "I got train.", "draft", or "stiff neck" but could not get a confirmation for them.
[07:35:47] <LjL> bullgard4, "a stiff neck" is common but i suppose i wouldn't call it the medical term, which i think would be "torticollis"
[07:36:24] <bullgard4> Let me see.

[14:23:24] <NccT>  As late as April 1789, the comte de Mirabeau observed in the south of France: “every scourge has been unloosed. Everywhere I have found men dead of cold and hunger, and that in the midst of the week for lack of flour, all the mills being frozen.”

[19:14:27] <kurahaupo> enoq: the rules for keeping or omitting silent letters are complicated and inconsistent. At heart they're attempting to mimic phonetics with too few actual symbols, where "g" in "ge" and "gi" is (usually) /dʒ/ or /ʒ/ but in "ga", "go" & "gu" is almost always /g/ (unless it follows "n" of course), and moreover "e" and "u" are often used as silent markers to force one or the other. Earlier versions of the rule included "a" on the opposite side, so tha
[19:14:27] <kurahaupo> "gaol" is /dʒe͡əl/
[19:17:06] <enoq> ah, I see
[19:17:10] <enoq> thanks
[19:17:36] <kurahaupo> enoq: in the case of the "-ble" suffix, an "a" is  usually inserted if no other vowel is present, but sometimes "i" is preferred in order to keep a "soft g", rather than the cumbersome "ea" pair,  as in "unintelligible"
[19:18:22] <enoq> so more of a feeling thing then
[19:18:41] <enoq> if it sounds too hard to pronounce it's probably something else
[19:19:30] <enoq> I can't remember anymore but I think there are some variants where the e is dropped 
[19:19:41] <enoq> so ...gable instead of ...geable
[19:20:01] <enoq> those are the ones that trip me up the most
[19:20:15] <kurahaupo> The tendency to keep a silent e and add another vowel is relatively recent. 30 years ago there are only a handful of exceptional words, whereas almost always the "e" would be removed

[19:21:52] <kurahaupo> And then there's the even older v/u split, leading to solve/soluble
[19:22:16] <enoq> btw, in German speaking countries there are reforms every couple of decades that fix these weird edge cases
[19:22:27] <enoq> English speaking countries don't do that right?
[19:23:36] <kurahaupo> I say "split" advisedly, because originally u+v were merely different ornamentation of the same letter, and split into separate letters for the vowel & consonant usage within the last 1000 years
[19:24:08] <kurahaupo> We don't have a central authority who can restrain or mandate changes
[19:25:36] <kurahaupo> The nearest are the "serious" dictionaries, and the training colleges for English teachers
[19:27:41] <kurahaupo> enoq: the e should be dropped when the added suffix starts with i, cause i "softens" the same consonants that e softens

[19:29:50] <kurahaupo> The only exceptions are where there are two words that differ (in spelling) only by a trailing e, eg "bing" and "binge"; in those cases it's acceptable to write "bingeing" to emphasize which root word was used
[19:30:30] <kurahaupo> Otherwise "garaging" is correct and "garageing" is wrong
[19:31:08] * mornfall disputes the right of garage to verb
[19:31:15] <kurahaupo> However that rule is often breached by younger writers

[23:36:11] <blkshp> Well I don't know.
[23:36:27] <blkshp> I just use language when I use it, I cannot consider when I use it when I'm not using it,

[23:40:15] <GuiToris> what are you going to do with your skill?
[23:40:25] <blkshp> that's the first time someone's given me something to really 'decode'
[23:40:52] <GuiToris> I can relate to that. That is what I've been doing with your language
[23:41:34] <blkshp> Nothing much but I have anted to learn it since i was about 12 but never really had a reason. My reason was that I wanted to prove that tttttttttttttttttt
[23:41:45] <GuiToris> you cannot change your name to -... .-.. -.- ... .... .--.  can you?
[23:41:54] <blkshp> my '-' key is s-uck xD

[23:43:21] <GuiToris> did you say period?
[23:43:26] <blkshp> No
[23:43:40] <GuiToris> I'm sorry. My ears heard that
[23:44:11] <blkshp> So why did you learn morse?
[23:44:39] <blkshp> I learned to prove that my brain can learn something as well as a 15 year old.
[23:45:05] <blkshp> though my advantage was that I had money and bought the full version of the app to learn, he only had the free version xD!

[23:48:17] <blkshp> xD
[23:48:27] <blkshp> 'mag'?
[23:48:48] <GuiToris> interesting you didn't know this :/
[23:49:12] <GuiToris> mag is unknown for some people, but I think it's quite a basic word
[23:49:33] <blkshp> I guess it just means "am"
[23:49:56] <GuiToris> wow :D no :D
[23:49:58] <GuiToris> https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jtvY5_48wws/hqdefault.jpg
[23:50:03] <GuiToris> another guess?
[23:50:38] <GuiToris> (you know am is bin)
[23:50:53] <GuiToris> (bin, sorry for the highlight)
[23:50:58] <blkshp> just tell me

[23:52:08] <tinsoldier> Translation: love
[23:52:44] <GuiToris> you aren't the only one who didn't know 'mag', I don't know 'like' is very basic in English
[23:52:56] <GuiToris> it's hard to get around
[23:53:16] <blkshp> It is odd I'll grant you.
[23:53:30] <GuiToris> blkshp, have you heard 'was magst du?'
[23:53:41] <blkshp> ohhhhhhhhh
[23:53:47] <blkshp> Yes!
