[00:00:50] <Nigthknight> b0nn: https://pastebin.com/Eu4gxCfG it cannot find a statement. But with only a dummy test it does create the breakpoint
[00:01:32] <b0nn> heh, I was just complaining about something similar on twitter yesterday :)
[00:02:03] <b0nn> you know that you can set breakpoints relative to the start of a function?
[00:02:30] <b0nn> eg. b main.main:2 is the second line in the main function in the main package
[00:03:47] <b0nn> What's that line in your source code, is it a statement, comment, whitespace?
[00:05:58] <Nigthknight> no I did not knew. It is the beginning of a function
[00:06:49] <b0nn> When a test compiles it (sometimes) injects stuff into the AST, that /may/ be screwing with your delve (and is a bug IMO)

[00:27:48] <b0nn> I comment them
[00:28:08] <b0nn> vim-commentary means it's a matter of going to the line and hitting the hotkey
[00:28:57] <b0nn> If go build allowed things for "just a debug build" - you /know/ that means that that code will end up in prod
[00:29:23] <tar_xvf> b0nn: i was about to say that. a go unsafe build would be nice for testing but im sure they have their reasons for not letting unused variables get into prod

[02:57:03] <b0nn> nah, if you move it you'll be managing it
[02:57:22] <b0nn> also go get will put it in $GOPATH/bin
[02:57:30] <b0nn> when it compiles
[02:57:31] <fizzie> Or $GOBIN, if that's set.
[02:57:59] <b0nn> actually, $GOBIN is easier - pop that into your $PATH
[02:58:03] <b0nn> assuming it's set
[02:59:12] <fizzie> If you already have a per-user "my own binaries" directory, a reasonable action is to point GOBIN there. Of course not the only way to do things.

[03:00:46] <vladoski> i don't mind having my go binaries in $home/go/bin

[03:01:12] <fizzie> If you're okay with that, it's already the default.
[03:01:36] <fizzie> The place it'll put binaries is $GOBIN if that's set; if not, then $GOPATH/bin if GOPATH is set; and finally ~/go/bin if neither is set.

[03:08:00] <lilgopher> I'm thinking how I will be able to convince my coworkers of starting to use interfaces to be able to inject dependencies. Our golang backend codebase has over 100,000 lines of code and we still are not using even one interface, and therefore we cannot really do integration testing(and the amount of unit testing we can do is very limited). I believe the pattern we are using is ok, just a domain layer, a couple of storage
[03:08:00] <lilgopher>  layers and microservices. My main worry when I try to expose them to interfaces is that they are going to think it is crazy having to define an interface for the database with all those function signatures and add a function signature every time they add a function. I'm looking if there is any tools that automate this process easily

[03:20:43] <fikran_> Is there a way to detect memory corruption issues?
[03:21:04] <fikran_> I am 99% certain I have some sort of memory issue around a map in concurrency, despite a mutex to protect it
[03:21:13] <b0nn>  what makes you think that you have memory corruption issues?
[03:21:50] <b0nn> If you are getting a nil pointer problem, that's because the map was never initialised
[03:21:50] <fizzie> The race detector is always worth a spin, at least.
[03:21:51] <fikran_> because seemingly accessing this map makes a random error happen that...I don't even know where/why it happens
[03:21:59] <fikran_> the map isn't empty.
[03:22:08] <fikran_> I tried to Marshal() a map
[03:22:28] <fikran_> and it comes back with this error: unsupported type: func(*http.Request) (*url.URL, error)
[03:22:44] <fizzie> Someone's put a function in your map.
[03:22:44] <fikran_> but why? I didn't send a func(*http.Request)
[03:22:52] <fikran_> no, i didn't send a function
[03:23:04] <fikran_> its a map.
[03:23:17] <fikran_> bytes, err := json.Marshal(runninginstances)
[03:23:21] <fikran_> runninginstances is a map for certain.
[03:23:21] <fizzie> Yes, but what is it a map of?
[03:23:31] <b0nn> face{}
[03:23:38] <b0nn> interface{}*
[03:23:40] <fikran_> var runninginstances map[string]shared.RunningInstance
[03:23:52] <fizzie> And what's a `shared.RunningInstance`?
[03:23:57] <fikran_> let me share code...
[03:24:14] <fizzie> You'd get that same error if anywhere in the map there's a value that has a function type. Even indirectly.

[05:19:46] <fikran> seebs: yeah thats my concern. wondering if an IDE can predict leaks...
[05:20:19] <seebs> so the good news and the bad news are the same:
[05:20:36] <seebs> you literally can't have a "memory leak" in a garbage-collected language, by definition -- every memory that is still allocated is reachable. :P
[05:20:46] <fikran> oh yeah :)
[05:21:27] <seebs> so the usual failure mode is to be keeping references you don't actually plan to use again, and i think some static analysis tools can sometimes spot this, but it's hard. usually the strategy is to just run the thing for a while and see which slots in a heap-in-use chart are still growing and which are staying the same.
[05:24:45] <fizzie> The `-diff_base` option can be particularly useful. As in, run for a while, capture a profile, run for a second while, capture another profile, and compare. Grouping by location of allocation can also help pinpoint which things are being permanently retained.

[06:59:17] <seebs> b0nn: yes, yes it was.
[06:59:32] <seebs> because, in order to detect double-frees (and report them), i kept a map with the items seen so far as keys
[07:00:03] <seebs> this is actually the best use case i've yet had for a weak-keyed map, where the keys won't count as references if they are the *only* reference to a thing, and can thus be freed and removed from the map.
[07:01:08] <b0nn> :)
[07:02:52] <b0nn> I've often wondered (and I read somewhere but cannot recall the answer) why a reference counter isn't built into the GC, instead of a mark & sweep run
[07:03:03] <b0nn> I mean, effectively, that'
[07:03:37] <b0nn> sthat's what Rust is doing, right, as soon as the allocated object's final reference is dropped then it's given the heave-ho

[07:31:28] <fizzie> The usual explanation is, (a) pure reference-counting GCs have problems with cyclic data structures, and (b) while updating the reference counts might *sound* super-cheap, it's actually not, since it has to happen every time the reference situation changes, while a GC cycle is only needed every now and then.
[07:31:34] <fizzie> And generational GCs take care of the "short-lived objects get reclaimed quickly" property equally well.

[08:04:10] <KirkMcDonald> And it *also* has a mark & sweep GC for detecting and collecting cycles.
[08:06:11] <KirkMcDonald> The reference counting is the cause of both good performance (it's really very cheap in the context of the Python interpreter) and bad (the GIL).

[09:02:03] <foobaz> instead of using environment variables, you can put the necessary compiler flags in the source code file by using cgo directives
[09:02:48] <foobaz> and instead of specifying CFLAGS directly, you can specify a pkg-config file
[09:03:07] <foobaz> that way it will work on distributions that install the headers and libraries in a different place
[09:03:22] <foobaz> there is some good documentation on these things here: https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/cgo
[09:03:29] <okt> Hmm, I see.
[09:03:35] <okt> Yes, that is the page I am reading, :)
[09:04:05] <foobaz> are you using bsd? /usr/local/include is a common header path on bsd
[09:04:10] <okt> Application is Gomuks, not sure if you are familiar.
[09:04:15] <okt> Yes, OpenBSD
[09:04:27] <foobaz> nice, i use freebsd myself for servers
[09:05:10] <foobaz> so this is not your own application? you're trying to compile code someone else wrote?
[09:05:30] <foobaz> if so, it's probably not worthwhile to fix the source code as i suggested, i assumed you were the developer
[09:05:38] <okt> Yeah I am trying to patch a few things I'd like in there over the package distributed.
[09:05:53] <foobaz> how about just using the CGO_LDFLAGS environment variable
[09:05:55] <okt> yeah that was the reason i was considering the ENV
[09:06:02] <okt> :)
[09:06:34] <foobaz> and file a bug with the developer telling him to use a "cgo pkg-config" directive
[09:06:49] <foobaz> i bet he hard-coded the linux include path or something
[09:07:51] <okt> Usually the case
[09:11:20] <foobaz> actually i'm not seeing any hard-coded include paths in here

[09:12:49] *** Joins: fef (~thedawn@user/thedawn)
[09:13:13] <foobaz> i guess /usr/local/include is not in the default path gcc looks in, so no hard-coded paths works the same way as the wrong hard-coded path
[09:14:25] <okt> when in doubt... check the open issues. :doh:
[09:14:37] <okt> https://github.com/tulir/gomuks/issues/292 worked perfectly.
[09:16:26] <foobaz> i see that olm installs a .pc file
[09:16:35] <foobaz> so using a cgo pkg-config directive would indeed fix this
[09:16:54] <foobaz> but, that's for the gomuks developer to do, not you
[09:17:05] <okt> I'll read up and possibly send a PR
[09:17:18] <foobaz> this is exactly the type of problem pkg-config was designed to fix
[09:17:30] <foobaz> and the olm developer kindly provided the necessary .pc file
[09:18:12] <okt> I certainly have /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/olm.pc
[09:18:45] <foobaz> take a look inside, it has the CFLAGS and LDFLAGS to use
[09:19:09] <okt> Oh brilliant
[09:19:11] *** Joins: ramblebamble (ramblebamb@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/ramblebamble)
[09:19:54] <foobaz> the way it's supposed to work is, the .pc file can specify /usr/local on bsd and /usr on linux, you tell go to use the .pc file, and everything just works
[09:20:22] <foobaz> but if you don't tell go about the .pc file, and you don't tell gcc to look in /usr/local by default, nothing knows where to find the library

[09:47:37] <seebs> i believe just go up. basically, adding things can't change any of the nodes that you aren't a child of, initially, so those are the ones you have to look at.
[09:47:56] <seebs> also in close to full generality you should almost certainly never use avl trees or red/black trees on modern hardware.

[09:48:17] <_mikey> really? why wouldn't you use them?
[09:48:17] <seebs> btree/b+tree are much, much, more compatible with systems that use caches and have much slower memory

[18:42:40] <LiENUS> so im on an arm mac and i need to do https://go.dev/doc/manage-install to get an older version
[18:42:49] <LiENUS> but theres no binary of the version i want for darwin/arm64
[18:43:05] <LiENUS> how do i either A) tell those instructions to use the amd64 version under rosetta 2 or b) compile it from source?
[18:44:06] <siXy> Source install instructions are here: https://go.dev/doc/install/source
[18:44:21] <siXy> I've not used a mac in a long while, and no idea how to do a)
[18:45:34] <LiENUS> is there a spot on that page you can point me to to install it ala the manage-install one where 1.14.15 will be callable as go1.14.15 and my 1.17 install will stay the main
[18:49:52] <siXy> You can use GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP=/some/path ./make.bash to install it some other place then put a shell alias to make go1.foo to point at that one
[18:49:52] *** Joins: Ergo^ (~ergo@91.238.59.144)
[18:50:16] <LiENUS> that sounds close enough for me
[18:50:34] <siXy> Note, however, that there's a non-trivial chance this might end up being quite hard - old versions have not been tested against darwin/arm64 as it didn't exist at the time
[18:50:45] <siXy> There's no guarentee this will actually work
[18:51:02] <siXy> If it's just a one-off test I'd use a VM or something.

[18:59:01] <LiENUS> didnt build of course, time to try binaries
[19:00:06] <LiENUS> im guessing then my best bet is to make a shell script for go1.foo that does `GOROOT=/some/path /some/path/bin/go`
[19:01:39] <siXy> I don't think you need GOROOT. I think go14=/some/path/bin/go will be enough

[22:18:51] <krux02> yea I am not american
[22:19:36] <pyzozord> what is the purpose of .Error on the error interface
[22:20:00] <pyzozord> why would anyone want to error.Error() and what does it do?
[22:20:29] *** Quits: casastorta (~casastort@neo2.krivokuca.net) (Quit: ZNC 1.8.2 - https://znc.in)
[22:20:44] <krux02> it returns a string (afaik)
[22:21:07] <pyzozord> what would be the most common usecase of this?
[22:21:38] <siXy> pyzozord: error is an interface, with error.Error() returning a string, because this means you can replace the standard error with your own implementation that satisfies that interface if you want.
[22:22:06] <pyzozord> does any code ever calls .Error()?
[22:22:20] *** Joins: casastorta (~casastort@neo3.krivokuca.net)
[22:22:39] <siXy> Sure. fmt.Println() for example.
[22:23:26] <pyzozord> doesn't Println call .String()?
[22:23:48] <siXy> error doesn't have a .String() method, so no.
[22:23:58] <pyzozord> ooh
[22:24:24] <pyzozord> so it's like .String() but for errors, and it's intentionally different so that you can tell what impelemnts error interface and what doesn't
[22:24:29] <krux02> if time would at least provide a reasonable time format string by default.
[22:24:42] <krux02> I always have to craft one.
[22:24:52] <krux02> const TimeFormat =  "2006-01-02 15:04 MST"
[22:25:06] <krux02> not tested yet, but that would be reasonable
[22:25:39] <krux02> or better
[22:25:59] <siXy> pyzozord: Yeah, that's right
[22:26:07] *** sshow_ is now known as sshow
[22:26:08] <krux02> or better yet, something like "YYYY-MM-DD ..." would have made sense
[22:26:11] <krux02> but nope
[22:27:26] <pyzozord> but why do that
[22:27:36] <siXy> Rob Pike got a lot of things right, but noone's perfect. This is one that he got wrong. You get used to it eventually, though.
[22:27:40] <pyzozord> why not just implement .String() for errors
[22:28:21] <ikke> You _can_ do that
[22:28:30] <siXy> pyzozord: Because being able to distinguish between an error and an arbitrary stringer is useful.
[22:29:02] <siXy> Detecting when something is an error, as opposed to some valid output, is something software engineers sometimes want to do ;)
[22:29:10] <pyzozord> but should you distinguish them by interface?
[22:29:15] <pyzozord> interface in go is not type
[22:29:27] <pyzozord> you can have different types with the same interface .String()
[22:29:34] <pyzozord> and still can tell them apart, right?
[22:29:58] <pyzozord> shouldn't*
[22:30:06] <siXy> pyzozord: An interface IS a type. They are listed under Types in the spec. They are a special kind of type, but a type nevertheless.
[22:31:05] <pyzozord> oh i see, it must use interface because type is concrete, that would mean you cannot create your own error types
[22:31:35] <pyzozord> ok so it's kind of abusing it's own systems to tell errors from non-errors and allow custom errors at the same type
[22:31:39] <pyzozord> *type=time
[22:31:43] <fizzie> I would imagine one reason why the `error` type has its own special "marker" method is, it makes sure you don't accidentally implement `error` and/or return things that aren't errors from methods that were expected to return errors.

[22:32:23] <fizzie> A lot of types implement fmt.Stringer, and not all of them really make any sense as an error value.
[22:32:28] <pyzozord> that's the thing, I am afraid I would implementet .Error() on object without intention of it being an error type
[22:32:44] <pyzozord> or you know some other interface with some other market method that I am not aware of
[22:33:13] <ikke> pyzozord: just 'Error() string'?
[22:33:45] *** Joins: casastorta (~casastort@neo2.krivokuca.net)
[22:33:56] <pyzozord> I mean say I have a logger interface that that has Log() Warn() Error()
[22:34:10] <pyzozord> I just accidentally implemented error interface
[22:34:12] <fizzie> Would it _really_ have `Error()` with no parameters?
[22:34:20] <fizzie> Returning a `string`.
[22:34:36] <pyzozord> sure it's edge case but it's just example
[22:34:49] <fizzie> Anyway, I don't think it's _that_ dangerous if it happens. But it's kind of an unavoidable consequence of the whole "interface implementation is implicit" thing.
[22:35:24] <pyzozord> or missing some more explicit type inheritance
[22:35:36] <pyzozord> or rather polymorphism
[22:35:47] <siXy> I can't think off-hand of any convincing real-world cases where something would have an `Error() string` method which wasn't returning an error, unless you're deliberately obfustacating your code for some reason.
[22:36:46] <pyzozord> the language uses 'implicit interface implementation' as de facto polimorphism which can be accidental because of the implicity. Can change either implicity or lack of polymorphism in the first place I think
[22:37:59] <pyzozord> Error() is just example, what I am really worried about is that I need to fully know entire standard library and all third party libraries I use to not accidentally run into this situation
[22:38:14] <ikke> pyzozord: or else?
[22:38:39] <pyzozord> or else my logger might be interpreted as error
[22:38:51] <ikke> What would accidentally interpret your logger as an error?
[22:39:14] <siXy> No you don't. Things don't magically happen because you have an `Error() string` method on your struct. Go is a language with very little hidden magic, so you don't need to worry about these things in practice.
[22:39:54] <pyzozord> not necessairly go itself, but some of my code that checks if the argument it received is an error
[22:40:30] <siXy> So you're worried about code that you write interacting badly with other code that you write? I mean... I guess I kind of see your point, but I think the solution is fairly clear?

The solution to this is to not do that.

[22:59:08] <shiroyasha> FTR you're unlikely to implement a method `func (foo *Foo) Error() string` unless it's a getter. So if you have a method that most would interpret as "get an error and returns it a string", I'd argue that it matches the semantics of the `error` interface.
[22:59:52] <mrig> Also if you return your type as an error, none of the other things on that type are accessible, only the Error() method would be.

[23:32:16] *** Joins: fikran (~fikran@user/fikran)
[23:32:29] <fizzie> If you remove the * on line 13, then it's both the type `MyError` *and* `*MyError` that implement the `error` interface.
[23:32:54] <fizzie> (Because methods with a non-pointer receiver are included in the method sets of both type `T` and `*T`. But not the other way around.)
[23:33:06] <pyzozord> aha!
[23:33:18] <pyzozord> i thought it was exactly invert of what you just said
[23:34:19] <b0nn> pointer instances of a type have all the methods of that type - value types only have the value methods
[23:34:39] <fizzie> I would rather say that `T` and `*T` are two different types with their own method sets.
[23:36:22] <b0nn> hmm - *T gets all of Ts methods, T doesn't get all of *Ts methods
[23:36:34] <b0nn> *T is the superset
[23:36:58] <fizzie> Oh, and just to muddle the situation a bit more, if `t` is an addressable value of type `T`, and the pointer type `*T` has a method `Foo()`, then the method *call* `t.Foo()` is still legal, even though the type `T` doesn't have the method.
[23:37:11] <fizzie> It's just treated as a syntactic shorthand for `(&t).Foo()`.
[23:37:17] <pyzozord> I think it's because t.Foo() hets promoted to (*t).Foo() when t was a pointer automatically
[23:37:29] <fizzie> No, it's different.
[23:37:49] <fizzie> If it was just a syntactic shorthand, it wouldn't affect which types implement which interfaces.
[23:37:50] <b0nn> lol, but the rules of go are simple dammit!
[23:38:15] <pyzozord> doesnt seem that way to me :P
[23:38:45] <mrig> It is quite logical really, if a Method on a pointer alters a member of the type then it does not need to return a value where as the same method on an actual instance of a type will do nothing unless it returns itself.

[23:42:30] *** Quits: fef (~thedawn@user/thedawn) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[23:42:58] <fizzie> Yeah, that example works because `*MyError`'s method set has the method too.
[23:43:25] <pyzozord> this is more interesting: https://go.dev/play/p/0pTqCzRbUJM
[23:43:48] *** Joins: itsalexjones (~itsalexjo@82.4.99.241)
[23:43:58] <pyzozord> so it's like kind of generics?
[23:44:15] <pyzozord> I would assume what happens is that (*err).Error() is being called inside Printf
[23:44:36] <pyzozord> or rather err.Error() which compiler later expands to (*err).Error()

[23:46:49] <pyzozord> this one is interesting too it thinks I am redeclaring https://go.dev/play/p/Vm4xIEPSIpb
[23:47:16] <pyzozord> I'm confused by the last one
[23:47:38] *** Quits: mickey8 (~user@user/mickey) (Quit: Ping timeout (120 seconds))
[23:47:52] <fizzie> Well, like we discussed, the first method is already in the method sets of both `MyError` *and* `*MyError`.
[23:48:01] *** Joins: mickey8 (~user@user/mickey)
[23:48:04] <fizzie> So you don't get to have a _different_ method with the same name on just `*MyError`.
[23:48:42] <b0nn> pyzozord: you are being mean to the compiler, it's confused on which MyError it should be calling
[23:49:01] <pyzozord> so it duplicates the same methods for both MyError and *MyError?
[23:49:22] <fizzie> I don't know if I'd say "duplicates" exactly, but the same method is in the method sets of both types.
[23:49:39] <pyzozord> so pointer on receiver does not count to method signature?
[23:49:46] <b0nn> because the pointer reciever's methods are a superset of the pointer receiver mthods *and* the value receiver's methods
[23:49:53] <pyzozord> but it does change what the method can do to the receiver
[23:51:07] <fizzie> And just to illustrate that the other way around it's just a syntactic shorthand: https://go.dev/play/p/ij8QHyw63Z6 -- line 18 is an error because `MyError` does not implement the error interface (the method is only in the method set of `*MyError`), but line 29 is _not_ an error, it just gets internally rewritten to `(&v).MyError`.
[23:52:09] <pyzozord> wow this is so confusing
[23:53:18] <pyzozord> so (*v).Method() and (&v).Method() rewrites are very naive and superficial
[23:54:46] <pyzozord> oh no i'm wrong, line 18 just complains because line 17 return type error interface does not match
[23:55:03] <b0nn> Does this help? https://go.dev/play/p/QlODzGGZeKW
[23:56:17] <pyzozord> ValChange() never gets called?
[23:56:47] <b0nn> The f inside Valchange is a value, so it changes it, just you can never see the change
[23:57:04] <pyzozord> right
[23:57:09] <b0nn> if you fmt.Print it inside valchange you will see
[23:57:22] <pyzozord> I understand that part
