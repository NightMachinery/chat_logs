[18:18:13] <Fohsap> or at least not look so much like a vpn as it does now
[18:21:45] <ordex> Fohsap: how can you do that if your app sends info directly to the various services?
[18:31:38] <Fohsap> I don't know how it could do that, anyway

[18:47:50] <DArqueBishop> Part of the issue you run into as well is that many companies are aware of what IP addresses the VPN providers use.
[18:49:27] <embargo> Hello, guys. I'm trying to use the OpenVPN as pure L2VPN solution and carry a VLAN tagged traffic through the tunnel. Is this scenario possible? Unfortunately, I'm not able to pass any VLAN tagged traffic. I'm running OpenVPN 2.5.3 arm-openwrt-linux-gnu [SSL (OpenSSL)] [LZO] [LZ4] [EPOLL] [MH/PKTINFO] [AEAD]
[18:50:36] *** Joins: eelstrebor (~eelstrebo@198-178-29-136.scb.ne.static.allophone.net)
[18:57:50] <embargo> I've played with bridging the TAP interface, creating an 802.1q interface over the TAP, but still no luck. On one side IÂ see tha packet is tagged and pushed in the parrent interface but on the other side of the tunnel nothing pops out.
[18:59:24] <rob0> Fohsap: I'd really be curious how that VPN provider claims to be able to do that.
[18:59:43] <rob0> Fohsap: (because I don't believe they can)
[18:59:52] <ordex> embargo: yes, this is supported, and openvpn can also handle VLAN tagging per client, as a smart switch
[19:00:17] <ordex> embargo: you can check --vlan-tagging in the manpage
[19:00:38] <ordex> embargo: however, even without this option, I think you should be able to send tagged packets back and forth
[19:00:45] <ordex> (IIRC)
[19:01:45] <rob0> could be the testing is flawed?
[19:02:33] <rob0> also, does the physical L2 switch support 802.1q tags?
[19:02:47] <ordex> rob0: I think he tested without the switch too
[19:03:07] <rob0> oh
[19:06:18] <ordex> embargo: yeah ideally it should still work without --vlan-tagging - it will just send traffic back and forth without adding any special logic

[19:16:10] <embargo> ordex: I'm not using any L2 device yet, just the tunnel between a client and a server.
[19:16:34] <ordex> embargo: yup, that should just work[tm]
[19:16:46] <ordex> obviously with dev tap
[19:16:48] <ordex> not tun
[19:17:16] <ordex> so you started openvpn with --dev tap, which creates tap0, and then you created tap0.1 ?
[19:17:22] <ordex> (or any other .x)
[19:17:26] <embargo> ordex: Exactly.
[19:17:35] <ordex> on both sides? and then tried to ping?
[19:19:01] <ordex> embargo: on a side note, did you test that the tunnel was working properly by just assigning IPs to the tap devices on both sides without a VLAN?
[19:19:05] <embargo> Yes. Well, not on the remote side, there is just plain tap interface. I was checking remote side with tcpdump to see if any packets arrives through the tunnel but the tcpdump was silent.
[19:19:19] <ordex> embargo: is dev tap on both sides?
[19:19:32] <embargo> Yes, I have dev tap on both sides.
[19:19:39] <ordex> hm ok
[19:19:50] <ordex> did you verify that something was actually entering tap0 on the sender side?
[19:22:49] <ordex> embargo: sorry for the 'stupid' questions, but it's more to understand what you are actually seeing in detail
[19:24:25] <embargo> ordex: No, it is not a stupid question at all.
[19:25:29] <embargo> Yes, I tried to use plain TAP interfaces, and run a ping between them. I'm using the IPv6 link-local addresses of the interfaces. T'm not able to reach the end.
[19:25:46] <embargo> Firewall is disabled.
[19:26:02] <ordex> embargo: so tap does not work, even before adding the VLAN
[19:26:24] <embargo> Probably. Do IÂ need to connect the TAP interface to a bridge interface?
[19:26:28] <ordex> I'd suggest setting verb 4 in your config and check if you get anything suspicious
[19:26:31] <ordex> embargo: no
[19:26:42] <ordex> tap is just an ethernet like interface, it does not require to be bridged
[19:26:50] <embargo> Great, this is what I though so.
[19:26:57] <ordex> have you tried manually adding some ipv4 address to both sides? just to test v4 vs v6 ?
[19:27:12] <ordex> (bugs may be hidden everywhere)
[19:29:09] <embargo> Yes, even no IPv4 traffic can pass. All I see with the tcpdump is the 'L2 keepalive ing' 
[19:29:38] <ordex> uhm
[19:29:47] <ordex> keepalives on the tap interface?
[19:31:35] <embargo> I will get more info and put it on the pastebin or something like that.
[19:31:39] <ordex> sounds good
[19:31:48] <ordex> on the tap iface I expect to see some ARP traffic
[19:31:56] <ordex> when you try to ping a v4
[19:32:02] <ordex> at least on the sender side
[19:32:17] <ordex> if there is no ARP on the server side, then something might be wrong even before reaching openvpn
[19:40:09] <embargo> https://turrian.svine.su/vpn/server.conf.txt && https://turrian.svine.su/vpn/client.conf.txt
[19:40:52] <ordex> embargo: oh you use a turris? :)
[19:41:26] <embargo> Well, I work for turrisâ€¦ :-)
[19:41:33] <ordex> ah ok :)
[19:41:44] <ordex> maybe later we can discuss some performance issue on my MOX :D
[19:41:53] <ordex> but regardless, do you also have the server log?
[19:47:40] <ordex> embargo: and also the other important bit was: tcpdump on the tap interface of the sender when you are attempting the ping
[19:49:16] <embargo> Logs https://turrian.svine.su/vpn/server.log.txt && https://turrian.svine.su/vpn/client.log.txt
[19:53:10] <rob0> nice, a .su domain!
[19:55:10] <embargo> rob0: Yeah, 'su' even is a czech slang word for 'I'm'
[19:55:13] <embargo> https://turrian.svine.su/vpn/client.debug.txt
[19:55:43] <embargo> So the traffic is not flowing at all :-D
[19:55:56] <ordex> embargo: is the last output on the server od receiver side ?
[19:55:59] <ordex> *or
[19:56:08] <embargo> It is made on the client.
[19:56:26] <ordex> ok, so you are trying to ping 192.168.200.1
[19:56:36] <ordex> and so tcpdump on the server shows nothing on the tap interface in this case?
[19:56:54] <embargo> Yes. https://turrian.svine.su/vpn/server.debug.txt
[19:58:36] <ordex> yeah, something is weird
[19:58:40] <ordex> will run some tests locally
[19:58:44] <ordex> haven't used tap in a while
[19:59:41] <embargo> And I will try another machine to see if my client is not somehow corruptedâ€¦
[20:01:40] <embargo> ordex: By the way this is what I though is the keepalive traffic in VPN https://turrian.svine.su/vpn/weird.traffic.txt
[20:02:10] <ordex> embargo: I wonder if you need tls-server in the config ?
[20:02:41] <embargo> IÂ guess it is because of the cipher I use? I know it was complaining that the option is missing
[20:03:29] <ordex> embargo: not sure
[20:03:39] <ordex> because tls-server teels the instance to act as server in the TLS handshake
[20:03:45] <ordex> as opposite to the tls-client
[20:03:51] <ordex> not sure what happens without that
[20:03:58] <embargo> root@turris:~# openvpn --show-ciphers | grep AES-256-GCM
[20:03:59] <embargo> AES-256-GCM  (256 bit key, 128 bit block, TLS client/server mode only)
[20:04:33] <ordex> yeah, but I wonder if the default is client and thus they are scrweing up the key derivation ?
[20:04:35] <embargo> Without this the VPNÂ does not start unless I delete the cipher option
[20:04:37] <ordex> never tried this config
[20:08:23] <ordex> embargo: just tested here and it works
[20:08:32] <ordex> so there must be something off 
[20:09:03] <ordex> (it works with tls-server in the config)
[20:10:03] <ordex> embargo: here the server does not start at all if I have mode server, but no tls-server
[20:12:37] <embargo> Hmmâ€¦ IÂ guess the openwrt is screwing my configuration somehowâ€¦
[20:14:10] <rob0> imagine that!
[20:15:15] <rob0> make it run ONLY "openvpn /path/to/config" and get their garbage out of the way
[20:16:15] <rob0> also, does the built-in switch on your openwrt device support vlan?
[20:16:37] <ordex> rob0: that's unrelated because the tagged traffic won't reach the switch :p
[20:16:51] <rob0> oh, right
[20:17:39] <embargo> Hm, I'm constantly getting the soft-restartsâ€¦ 
[20:20:16] <embargo> ordex: I'm open to your troubles with MOX. IÂ guess it will be more suitable to invite you to our half-official support channel here on Libera and discuss it here. Please /join #turris :-)
[20:35:18] <ordex> embargo: soft-restarts -> something is not working then - regardless of tap, I'd say
[20:47:17] <embargo> ordex: Last question. When IÂ start the ovpn server (tap interface) do I need to manually bring the interface up? I'm not sure if this is handled by openvpn itself or not.
