[02:11:01] <Satin> Perks of growing up in a southern baptist conservative nutjob family. Woo.
[02:11:03] <Bco1981> MootPoot: if you have a vps, then you can ssh tunnel from home to the vps. and forward what ever back home through the tunnel... so i have heard.
[02:11:11] <klaxa> MootPoot: literally use tor, just set up a hidden service on your local machine and you can access it from your server through tor
[02:11:16] <Satin> I should go back to using TrueCrypt/VeraCrypt containers.
[02:11:23] <MootPoot> klaxa: tor is slow as shit

[02:12:19] <Satin> Hmmm I should mess with TOR
[02:12:35] <klaxa> otherwise wireguard is a good vpn solution, if you want something userland based, i use tinc-vpn to connect my server, my pi, my laptop(s) and my phone
[02:12:52] <MootPoot> I dont care about uber security 
[02:12:59] <MootPoot>  just enough that a typical ip lookup wont show

[02:13:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> wireguard exists in userland as well
[02:13:15] <klaxa> true
[02:13:30] <klaxa> but i never got it to work :V
[02:13:36] <klaxa> so i just stuck with tinc
[02:13:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Ah.
[02:14:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'd been using the DKMS version for a while, only relatively recently switched to the kernel-backed one.
[02:14:21] <MootPoot> I tried to make wireguard work

[02:14:31] <klaxa> give tinc a try

[02:14:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It just kept on working.
[02:14:41] <klaxa> you have to copy around a bunch of files

[02:16:02] <Bco1981> MootPoot: unless you have some dyndns going, it's going to be a pain, sine you need to keep checking what you ip is now.
[02:16:11] <Bco1981> since*
[02:16:39] <MootPoot> basically what I want is ( internet computer ) -> my URL -> VPS box -> my home box
[02:16:57] <MootPoot> no idea how to go about setting that up
[02:16:58] <klaxa> yeah that's easy enough with a vpn
[02:17:16] <Bco1981> klaxa: still a hassel with a dynamic ip at home.
[02:17:22] <klaxa> not... really?
[02:17:35] <Bco1981> you need to know aht ip it is "now"
[02:17:39] <Bco1981> what*
[02:17:44] <klaxa> home computer (with dynamic ip or whatever) connects to server vpn
[02:17:55] <klaxa> server has a static ip or domain or whatever
[02:17:57] <Sapphirus> yes and that should be sufficient for what he wants
[02:18:05] <Sapphirus> server IP should be static.
[02:18:10] <klaxa> you connect to the server and the server forwards the packets to the home computer's vpn address
[02:18:46] <klaxa> you don't need to know the home computer's public ip address, all you need to know is the home computer's vpn ip address
[02:18:51] <klaxa> which you are in control of configuring
[02:19:14] <Bco1981> ah, makes sence. so static forwards always hit the same ip, the vpn ip.
[02:19:38] <klaxa> yes
[02:20:01] <klaxa> but that's also transparent to computers connecting to the server
[02:20:06] <klaxa> they will think they are talking to the server
[02:20:17] <klaxa> while behind the curtains the server is talking to the home computer
[02:20:48] <Bco1981> yeah i'm doing the same thing on this , just with sshfs
[02:21:24] <klaxa> you sshfs from the server to your home computer?
[02:21:24] <Bco1981> thou i have static ip at home so i can lock it down with iptables.
[02:21:32] <Bco1981> to my home nas
[02:21:56] <klaxa> ah i see, without the ISP crapping everything up it's much easier yeah
[02:22:02] <Bco1981> yeah
[02:22:21] <klaxa> you see, in germany i even have carrier-grade NAT meaning i share a public ipv4 address with multiple customers
[02:22:31] <klaxa> so i can't even portforward to my public ip address
[02:22:35] <MootPoot> Is there a way to multiplex that as well?
[02:22:36] <MootPoot> or no
[02:22:48] <klaxa> multiplex what and how
[02:22:50] <Bco1981> well this isp uses carrier-grade NAT too, but i can pay to get my own static ip.
[02:22:57] <Bco1981> which i chose to do.
[02:22:59] <MootPoot> say I want 3-4 servers on my side -> VPS -> 3-4 hostnames
[02:23:32] <klaxa> for http, yes for everything else, pretty much not, but you can use different ports for different services
[02:24:02] <Sapphirus> get 4 static v4 addresses and then solved
[02:25:02] <MootPoot> well, I want a few http websites
[02:25:03] <Bco1981> if only 1 ip, forward server ports 10000-19999 to host 1, ports 20000-29999 to host 2. etc.
[02:25:15] <klaxa> http is pretty much the only protocol that sends the hostname with requests
[02:25:19] <Sapphirus> why would you want to do that, though
[02:25:31] <MootPoot> so I can make do with 1 VPS instead of 4?
[02:25:33] <klaxa> and webservers can route them depending on the hostname
[02:25:34] <Sapphirus> nah, you've got others like smtp

[02:44:14] <ButterNoodle> its not shit

[02:45:27] <Bco1981> one thing is if it changes, the other thing is, no ports are forwarded.
[02:45:40] <MootPoot> yeah, that's why i wanted to just do the VPS setup - I can use their static IP AND I can hide my location
[02:45:55] <ButterNoodle> oh I thought u were talking about both

[02:45:59] <ButterNoodle> *do both
[02:46:16] <MootPoot> no, It was just something I was considering

[05:45:29] <Satin> JesseDesu: yes

[05:46:25] <MootPoot> taste
[05:46:27] <MootPoot> jk

[05:46:52] <JesseDesu> peach mango is gud
[05:46:57] <JesseDesu> you only had blue razz

[05:47:45] <MootPoot> peach is like barely not shit
[05:47:50] <MootPoot> blue razz is actually shit
[05:47:58] <JesseDesu> theres cotton candy
[05:48:13] <MootPoot> Satin: for some reason energy drink makers more often then not dont know how to make their stuff taste good
[05:48:19] <MootPoot> like, aside from monster energy
[05:48:26] <MootPoot> everything else is hit and miss
[05:48:31] <Satin> redbull flavoured too
[05:48:34] <Satin> MootPoot: yeah agreed
[05:48:42] <Satin> most energy drinks are so blegh tasting
[05:48:45] <JesseDesu> monster effects are weak
[05:48:46] <S_T_A_N> ButterNoodle, I am like broken. It's literally me irl
[05:48:54] <Satin> JesseDesu: you realize that's coz bang is 
[05:48:55] <Satin> so fucking
[05:48:57] <Satin> crazy caffineeated
[05:48:59] <JesseDesu> redbull is weak
[05:49:00] <Satin> it's nto healthy
[05:49:02] <Satin> wrong
[05:49:06] <MootPoot> I've never encountered a monster which wasen't as like 5/10 at least
[05:49:12] <JesseDesu> redbull is super weak
[05:49:18] <JesseDesu> its water
[05:49:27] <MootPoot> but at that point if you want bang levels of caffiene just become a espresso snob like ButterNoodle and S_T_A_N 
[05:49:35] <S_T_A_N> > I Became a Black Gal So I Fucked My Best Friend
[05:49:39] <JesseDesu> redbull is the tea of energy drinks
[05:49:44] <S_T_A_N> why does this exist
[05:49:57] <MootPoot> JesseDesu: the tea of energy drinks is monster rehab, which is actually tea afaik
[05:50:00] <MootPoot> lemon tea something

[05:50:26] <MootPoot> I swapped to the new router - somehow both my wired and wireless are performing much better
[05:50:31] <MootPoot> which makes no sense
[05:50:38] <MootPoot> like I went from 750mbit on wired to 1gbit
[05:51:21] <ButterNoodle> why
[05:51:33] <MootPoot> I dont get it either
[05:51:35] <MootPoot> but it did
[05:51:45] <MootPoot> maybe the old one was just shit
[05:52:04] <ButterNoodle> just because its a gig port.. doesnt mean it will forward a gig
[05:52:23] <MootPoot> really?
[05:52:31] <ButterNoodle> we call that non-blocking in the enterprise world
[05:52:31] <MootPoot> TIL
[05:53:01] <mixfix41> is that with the cache like the 10 gbit raspberry has a limiting cache to 4 actuality
[05:53:01] <MootPoot> mobile devices are also much faster now
[05:53:15] <ButterNoodle> consumer shit might have a gig chip to split between all the ports and  wireless
[05:53:52] <ButterNoodle> u really need to know what kinda asic is in it and how its subscription is setup
[05:55:04] <ButterNoodle> early cisco gig switches were oversubscribed 4 or even 8 to 1 .. so u would start dropping frames after u hit a combined total of a gig on that bank of ports
[05:55:51] <ButterNoodle> there is probably some strange shit with bridging dis similar media types too that is asic dependent
[05:57:39] <MootPoot> wifi to nas speed basically doubled
[05:57:44] <MootPoot> as well
[05:58:09] <MootPoot> although this one uses like a shit ton more  power as well tbh
[05:58:20] <MootPoot> 42w psu compared to 11 for the last one
[05:59:05] <MootPoot> interestingly it has a built in dynamic DNS feature from tp link themselves - might cum in handy later
[05:59:33] <MootPoot> wired page latency is noticably better as well

[12:03:01] <amigojapan> I see
[12:03:13] <DunceCotus> there are tattoo-friendly onsens
[12:03:18] <DunceCotus> according to Wikipedia
[12:03:32] <amigojapan> Duns_Scrotus: only onsen, sentos and the beach have that rule
[12:03:48] <amigojapan> Duns_Scrotus: and pools
[12:04:31] <amigojapan> There are DunceCotus . Usually owned by Yakuza
[12:05:32] <DunceCotus> "
[12:05:33] <DunceCotus> With the increase in foreign customers due to growing tourism, some onsen that previously banned tattoos are loosening their rules to allow guests with small tattoos to enter, provided they cover their tattoos with a patch or sticking plaster"
[12:05:36] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I would not want to be restricted to those
[12:06:29] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: you could become friendly with the Yakuza
[12:06:36] <DunceCotus> who knows the possibilities
[12:06:44] <amigojapan> Lol
[12:07:07] <Duns_Scrotus> My last tattoo artist had a huge piece by some Japanese artist
[12:07:18] <Duns_Scrotus> He said the guy wouldn‚Äôt talk about his time in Japan
[12:07:45] <DunceCotus> oh..
[12:07:53] <amigojapan> Sounds like PTSD
[12:07:55] <DunceCotus> that good eh?
[12:08:14] <Duns_Scrotus> Or just not wanting to admit to crimes
[12:08:22] <DunceCotus> Japanese are discriminatory against tattooed people?
[12:08:46] <Duns_Scrotus> Yeah it‚Äôs a sign of criminality
[12:09:08] <luke-jr> Duns_Scrotus: don't do it

[12:09:16] <luke-jr> [08:27:59] <Duns_Scrotus> Also I have a tattoo appointment in 90 minutes

[12:22:45] <Terminus> there was this neat japanese restaurant near me. every time i went there, there was this yakuza guy drinking at the bar. seemed pretty normal and friendly. only the yakuza tattoos gave it away.

[13:48:48] <zoidberg> vanakkam is tamil greeting
[13:49:09] <evolv> that is correct
[13:49:39] <evolv> that is the only new Tamil word I've learned this year
[13:50:07] <zoidberg> evolv: the only tamil I know is, "tamil teriyadu"
[13:50:11] <evolv> I'm pretty sure I am supposed to be able to at least have a shallow conversation in it at this point, but oh, well
[13:50:16] <zoidberg> which means I don't know tamil
[13:50:36] <evolv> I can teach you something
[13:50:39] <evolv> "gunda chandi"
[13:51:02] <zoidberg> what does that mean?
[13:51:06] <evolv> fat butt
[13:51:15] <zoidberg> lol
[13:51:29] <zoidberg> gunda is fat I guess, am I right?
[13:51:34] <evolv> yeah
[13:52:36] <evolv> but, yeah, I can't stand my wife's sister and brother-in-law
[13:52:39] <zoidberg> that was a wild guess. I know gundaram in my language means round, so I thought it's fat.
[13:52:58] <zoidberg> yeah evolv, you told us about them
[13:52:59] <evolv> and they're so phony, their fireplace is just fake logs connected to a gas line
[13:53:00] <evolv> :|
[13:53:34] <evolv> yeah, well, communication has been re-established just before my mother and father in law arrived to the US
[13:53:57] <evolv> it's been a power struggle where my MIL and FIL are treated like children in the middle of a custody dispute

[13:55:43] <evolv> another Tamil I had dated a long while back taught me it as fat
[13:55:49] <amigojapan> evolv: let me show you a picture of my fire place
[13:55:57] <evolv> she taught me "gunda punai"
[13:55:59] <evolv> fat cat

[15:15:30] <amigojapan> darkwitch: it's called swipe
[15:16:03] <`Zephyr> Or maybe your keyboard is like mine. It only listens to me about 90 percent of the time. The other 10 percent is just gibberish. Usually I backspace it away. Sometimes I forget. 
[15:17:08] <amigojapan> `Zephyr: I am using swipe on a phone
[15:17:29] <amigojapan> `Zephyr: too lazy to boot up my computer
[15:17:52] <amigojapan> This thing is already booted all the time
[15:20:28] <Bco1981> then why do you disconnect ?
[15:21:36] <amigojapan> Bco1981: cause I am using the free version of irccloud. Also I don't want to be interrupted when I am busy
[15:22:14] <amigojapan> Bco1981: the free version disconnects after 3 hours of inactivity
[15:22:20] <Bco1981> ah
[15:23:01] <zoidberg> I also use irccloud amigojapan 
[15:23:17] <amigojapan> Bco1981: but I have used this phone so much that it is like I sanded down a layer of glass of my screen

[15:23:35] <amigojapan> Yep zoidberg :)

[15:25:11] <zoidberg> I know
[15:26:26] <amigojapan> Bco1981: one of the reasons I like IRC is because I can leave when I need to

[15:27:28] <amigojapan> Ah
[15:27:29] <Bco1981> you never see when i jump from pc to pc.
[15:27:48] <zoidberg> irccloud works fine for me, it has last seven days logs, that's all I need
[15:28:03] <amigojapan> Bco1981: irccloud does that too. But is easy to use
[15:28:32] <zoidberg> Bco1981 has a remote pc with vps for all sorts of stuff amigojapan

[15:30:18] <zoidberg> hehe
[15:30:21] <amigojapan> Lol Bco1981

[15:38:19] <Terminus> i try not to give out personal info and the way to do that with matrix is to run your own server.

[15:39:32] <Terminus> amigojapan: yes. https://element.io/ is the one https://matrix.org/ uses. i didn't want to sign up though hence i made my own server.

[16:36:02] <Terminus> great. local BTC dealer is being stupid with how they calculate their transaction fees for sending BTC. they calculate the fee based on BTC price, send you OTP, by the time you punch it in, they say the fees have changed and you have to do it all over again. it becomes an infinite loop. my dad's been trying to execute a transaction for like 20 minutes already.

[16:52:10] <Sadale> I actually like the idea of bitcoin to create a decentralized transaction system

[16:56:23] <Sadale> Terminus, Anyway it's legal here.

[16:58:40] <Satin> Terminus: they've got a few darkweb criminals just from their transaction history
[16:58:41] <Terminus> you can track the movement because public ledger which was a design goal. doesn't mean you can claim somebody owns X amount.
[16:58:53] <Satin> Sadale: bitcoin wasn't designed with privacy in mind, monero is
[16:59:08] <Sadale> I don't think the government would bother to track individual BTC users. There're too many people using it.
[16:59:12] <Satin> "Monero. ... Monero transactions are much more difficult to trace because they use ring signatures and stealth addresses. These methods help to hide the identities of the sender and the receiver. Additionally, Ring Confidential Transactions, or RingCT, helps to conceal the transaction amount, providing more privacy."
[16:59:15] <Satin> Sadale: wrong

[16:59:41] <Satin> all US exchanges have to have "know your customer" forms etc
[16:59:45] <Sadale> oh.
[16:59:47] <Satin> and the IRS is going to use those
[17:00:00] <Sadale> Makes sense. If you're using those exchanges, you'd be easily get tracked.
[17:00:08] <Satin> i'm sure PH is doing something, but I'm not sure how aggressive they're being about the reporting.
[17:00:43] <Terminus> we've had KYC forever. that still doesn't mean they can prove something once crypto has left an exchange.
[17:01:02] <Terminus> now, if you're doing shady stuff straight from an exchange wallet, you're being stupid.
[17:01:05] <Sadale> If you're willing to pay transaction fee tho, you could just do money laundary easily. Just generate random transactions and send the fund to other wallet addresses of yours. Split the fund, merge them, send them to multiple addresses which ultimately you'd hold all of the coin back minus the transaction fees. :P
[17:01:28] <Satin> Sadale: sounds easy as fuck to track
[17:01:32] <Satin> and guess what happened there
[17:01:33] <Sadale> not really.
[17:01:46] <Sadale> They can't tell if you've sent the fund to someone else or the address is of your own
[17:01:48] <Terminus> Sadale: i've tried zero fee. my transaction still got confirmed in 48 hours. if you've got time, just scramble with zero fees.
[17:01:49] <Satin> oh you said "multiple addresses"
[17:01:55] <Sadale> Terminus, cool!
[17:02:00] <Satin> then it depends on how you use those multiple addresses
[17:02:13] <Sadale> I think there're probably existing programs to do that automatically.
[17:02:21] <Terminus> but zero fees is another pattern that can be tracked. better to randomize fees.
[17:02:34] <Sadale> As of today BTC is legal here
[17:02:39] <Satin> Terminus: sounds like a lot of $ :p
[17:02:50] <Terminus> if you make them all look like legal transactions, you're effectively scrambled.
[17:02:58] <Satin> I remember using dogecoin to buy a gaming mouse and such some years ago
[17:03:04] <Satin> I had 100k dogecoin at the time
[17:03:08] <Satin> no one cared about it back the
[17:03:08] <Sadale> If you're using a decentralized "exchange" like bisq, the government would have a harder time to track you
[17:03:09] <Satin> n
[17:03:10] <Terminus> do it bit by bit too because big movements will get tracked.
[17:03:13] <Sadale> if you need to hide it.
[17:03:16] <Satin> and the transaction fees just to buy an amazin gift card
[17:03:18] <Satin> were crazy
[17:03:28] <Satin> s/amazin/amazon/
[17:04:10] <Terminus> Sadale: the merchant we want to pay is in mainland china. accepts BTC, ETH, LTC, and USDT. XD
[17:04:30] <Sadale> Terminus, lol
[17:05:07] <Sadale> speaking of being watched, I now have a problem. The sex toys that I've ordered has got delivered and available for pick up. I've collected it and put that onto my backpack. But I couldn't take them out because my stupid parents are around and I don't want them to know about that. :/
[17:05:16] <Terminus> only problem is the crypto exchange on our end being stupid about outbound transaction fees.
[17:05:22] <Sadale> Have to wait until they leave so that I could hide them and use them
[17:05:41] <Sadale> Terminus, yeah. Most exchange charge a lot of transactrion fees
[17:05:49] <Satin> Terminus: do you have a healthy diversity in crypto exchanges
[17:05:52] <Satin> or is there only one
[17:05:54] <Satin> or two
[17:05:55] <Sadale> They want to hold the money
[17:06:18] <Terminus> Sadale: by tx fee, i mean the mining fee. they keep on recomputing it based on price fluctuations so we can't actually send the BTC.
[17:06:52] <Terminus> they're not getting a single cent from the mining fee. they make their money from the ridiculous 4% spread between buy and sell prices.
[17:08:08] <Terminus> Satin: i haven't actually looked at the exchanges here lately. i do have the CEO's phone number for the exchange we're using right now though. i can always call him and complain. kek
[17:09:59] <Sadale> Terminus, lucky you got connections
[17:10:03] <Satin> Terminus: nice :P
[17:10:10] <Sadale> Terminus, which exchange you're using tho?
[17:11:45] <Terminus> Sadale: coins.ph
[17:11:54] <Terminus> i actually haven't talked to the CEO in years. XD

[17:13:06] <Satin> goddamm
[17:13:20] <Satin> I want one but I want a prebuilt.
[17:13:39] <Sadale> Terminus, oh. A PH site. I probably can't open an account there
[17:15:11] <Sadale> Terminus, lol even at level 4 verifciation you could only cash in $10k max.
[17:16:17] <Sadale> Terminus, I think $10k is probably a lot there tho./
[17:17:40] <Sadale> Actually it's quite a lot here as well. :p
[17:17:54] <Sadale> If you make $10k a month here you're like filthy rich
[17:18:45] <Terminus> Sadale: they don't want the equivalent of bank runs.
[17:18:53] <Sadale> true
[17:19:33] <Sadale> Terminus, oh. actually it said cash in, not cash out
[17:20:40] <Terminus> Sadale: there's bitfinex.com but i've never tried buying crypto directly with them. i only trade there. they have their issues but not with me so far. they have decent volume. bitfinex HQ is in HK.
[17:20:59] <amigojapan> darkwitch: I got tomako angry :( altho I thought today had gone very well
[17:21:16] <Terminus> Sadale: the actual limit is $100k cash in and $100k cash out per year.
[17:21:21] <Sadale> Terminus, I'm thinking about registering on binance
[17:21:32] <Terminus> Sadale: whatever works for you man
[17:21:37] <Sadale> Terminus, I'll look into bitfinex anyway :3
[17:21:58] <Sadale> Terminus, dunno. I'm trying to pick one. So many choices. Anyway I don't think it matters that much as I won't be using their wallets. I don't trust online wallets.
[17:22:01] <Satin> darkwitch: what was she angry about
[17:22:05] <Satin> oops wrong ping
[17:22:06] <Terminus> Sadale: binance does have the biggest volume in the world.
[17:22:09] <Satin> amigojapan: ^
[17:22:47] <darkwitch> amigojapan, you know, that sounds like a normal day for you
[17:23:29] <Terminus> Sadale: more importantly, bitfinex is 3rd highest in liquidity. the top 3 in terms of liquidity are binance, FTX, and bitfinex in that order.
[17:23:34] <amigojapan> Satin: she was saying something about accomplishing something in 10 years. I said "I hope you can be calmer then"that got her really angry
[17:23:42] <Sadale> Terminus, nice! :3
[17:24:18] <amigojapan> darkwitch: we go long times weight fighting too tho
[17:24:39] <darkwitch> weight fighting?
[17:24:52] <amigojapan> darkwitch: Withought fighting
[17:24:59] <darkwitch> ah lol
[17:25:34] <Satin> amigojapan: I can understand why that would make someone angry, though it's better to not get easily angered
[17:25:36] <amigojapan> darkwitch: it got the w and the t right
[17:26:15] <Terminus> Sadale: don't you have crypto already? i mean, we've talked about crypto in this channel for around a decade already at this point.
[17:26:24] <amigojapan> Satin: the doctors have told me she will calm down after menopause
[17:26:32] <Sadale> Terminus, I do. But I've only got the one that I mined a fwe years ago
[17:26:48] <Sadale> Terminus, I need to buy BTC somehow if I want more.
[17:26:57] <darkwitch> Sadale should 3D print a cat house and move out with his toys
[17:27:09] <Sadale> haha
[17:27:17] <Satin> amigojapan: it's one factor among many
[17:27:17] <Sadale> darkwitch, I actually 3D printed a container to store my toys
[17:27:50] <Satin> Sadale: C*** doesn't allow buying crypto?
[17:27:53] <darkwitch> Sadale, I said that you should make it a bit larger so you could live in it
[17:28:22] <amigojapan> Right Satin . Then I told her that she is calmer than before. And she said I am putting all the fault on her
[17:28:55] <Terminus> Sadale: well, you gotta figure that out for yourself. i can buy crypto at 7-11 here.
[17:28:57] <Satin> Damm.
[17:29:00] <Sadale> Satin, That only applies to mainland China. Despite that HK being inside China, we currently allow buying crypto. Anyway I've heard that they may be banning retail people from using exchanges soon
[17:29:07] <Sadale> Terminus, woah.
[17:29:16] <Sadale> Terminus, I'm surprised. Didn't know that crypto were that widespread over there
[17:29:24] <Sadale> Terminus, here we've got BTC ATMs.
[17:29:30] <Sadale> But we can't buy in 7-11
[17:30:00] <Terminus> Sadale: i've been able to buy crypto at 7-11 for the past 7 years.
[17:30:00] <zoidberg> Terminus: how long does matrix keep me online?
[17:30:43] <Terminus> zoidberg: should be forever but i think element.io kicks people out of channels if they've been idle for too long. if you run your own server, it's forever.
[17:31:06] <zoidberg> I see. It‚Äôs similar to IRCCloud
[17:31:29] <amigojapan> Terminus: is a day too long?
[17:31:31] <Terminus> oh wait, i think it's libera that does the kicking. i've been inactive for too long and just found out my matrix account was kicked from a channel. lol
[17:31:38] <Terminus> amigojapan: nah... we're talking weeks.
[17:32:05] <amigojapan> Ah ok zoidberg weeks is no problem for us heavy users
[17:32:07] <Sadale> Terminus, That'd be one more reason for me to move to PH I guess xD
[17:32:15] <Sadale> Terminus, oh. And no winter over there :3
[17:32:40] <Sadale> damn. It's winter right here and I feel like as if I'm in Russia. I'm cold af >_<
[17:32:44] <amigojapan> Zoidberg better than 3 hours
[17:33:00] * Sadale checks the temperature. It's 16.5C
[17:33:06] <zoidberg> Sadale: try summer with humidity, it‚Äôs hell
[17:33:12] <zoidberg> Yeah amigojapan
[17:33:13] <Sadale> lol in Russia that'd be like -40C
[17:33:21] <Sadale> zoidberg, I've experience that.
[17:33:25] <Sadale> I've experienced that*
[17:33:32] *** Quits: DunceCotus (~DunceCotu@user/duncecotus) (Quit: Leaving)
[17:33:35] <Sadale> Summer here's hot and humid as well :/
[17:33:58] <Terminus> Sadale: 15 C sounds comfy. we hate the temps in the philippines. too hot. 26 C right now.
[17:34:04] <zoidberg> Oh yes, HK is similar. I‚Äôm not sure which is better weather wise.
[17:34:09] <Sadale> Terminus, lolwut? 26C is how?
[17:34:33] <Sadale> Terminus, 26C is comfy to me. Here summers can get the temp to up to, I dunno, maybe 36 or 38C? :P
[17:34:45] <Sadale> It's winter rn tho if you're in northern hemisphere
[17:34:45] <zoidberg> 26C is good
[17:35:04] <Terminus> Sadale: just philippine things...
[17:35:17] <Terminus> i'd prefer 22 C really.
[17:35:47] <Terminus> Sadale: wasn't i there during summer? weather was nice. except for the storm. ü§£
[17:36:04] <Sadale> Terminus, lol I couldn't remember if it was in summer
[17:36:12] <Sadale> Terminus, which month you were in here?
[17:36:34] <Sadale> The real summer here is like July and August. That's the hottest months in the year >_<
[17:36:58] <Terminus> Sadale: august. i just checked climate. i've experienced your summer and it's nothing like summer here. your summer is comfy.
[17:37:07] <Sadale> Terminus, oh wow
[17:37:25] <Sadale> Terminus, that's scary. With climate change and shit, would PH still be livable?
[17:37:39] <Terminus> Sadale: no idea but hey, i gotta live here.
[17:37:47] <Sadale> Terminus, IIRC tho the day that we met wasn't the hottest day.
[17:38:06] <Terminus> bearbeer and i were trying to figure out where in the world would be the best place to live.
[17:38:09] <Sadale> Terminus, true. If I ended up moving to PH and found that it ain't livable I could just get back to HK xD
[17:38:17] <Sadale> Latin America?
[17:38:35] <zoidberg> If I use AC, I set it up for 27C or 28C.
[17:38:42] <Sadale> Language-wise, learn Spanish and you're good there.
[17:38:48] <Sadale> (Except for Brazil)
[17:38:52] <zoidberg> 26C on AC is cold for me.
[17:39:06] <amigojapan> Satin: tomako says now "we have lived together for 20 years, from the beginning he has not changed a bit. He has not regreted what he did even once, if he does not regret what he did this year, I will divorce him this year"
[17:39:15] <Sadale> Terminus, BTW, do you use AC 24/7 there?
[17:39:27] <Terminus> so far we've got western coast of africa, brazil, and the mediterranean parts of morroco and algeria.
[17:39:40] <Terminus> Sadale: yeah, AC is pretty much 24/7 365 days a year.
[17:39:46] <Sadale> I see.
[17:39:47] <Satin> damm
[17:40:02] <Sadale> Terminus, what did you mean that you've got those countries? Did you mean that you guys have visited those places?
[17:40:04] <Terminus> i turn off the AC when i leave my room for an hour like for lunch.
[17:40:07] <zoidberg> How much you power bill you pay?
[17:40:16] <Terminus> Sadale: no. i mean good places to live in.
[17:40:20] <Sadale> Terminus, ah
[17:40:37] <Sadale> Terminus, PH is one of the best place to live in because living cost. :P :P
[17:40:47] <Sadale> s/place/places/ stupid English grammar
[17:40:50] <Terminus> zoidberg: ~$120 in december to ~$300 march to may.
[17:41:33] <amigojapan> Terminus: I pay 50usd in both mid summer and mid winter
[17:41:47] <zoidberg> I see. I‚Äôm not sure how to judge that. I don‚Äôt know anyone who uses 24x7 AC.
[17:41:48] <amigojapan> Terminus: per month
[17:41:53] <Sadale> Terminus got a house. He's rich
[17:41:54] <Terminus> amigojapan: cheaper electricity there plus you don't need to cool much.
[17:42:08] *** Joins: mero (uid94492@id-94492.lymington.irccloud.com)
[17:42:12] <Sadale> fat cat Terminus :P
[17:42:16] * Sadale thin cat :3
[17:42:21] <zoidberg> I pay around 4USD per month.
[17:42:23] <zoidberg> Lol
[17:42:33] <amigojapan> Terminus: we get 37c with 100 percent humidity
[17:42:45] <Terminus> i get a lower bill in december because cooler temps so AC doesn't have to work as hard to keep the room cool.
[17:42:50] <amigojapan> Nice! Zoidberg
[17:42:54] <Sadale> zoidberg, lol that's a little
[17:43:23] <amigojapan> Terminus: in winter we run it as heater
[17:43:24] <Terminus> amigojapan: for a couple of months or even just a month, yes. here we get hot temps for 9 months.
[17:43:34] <Sadale> zoidberg, Now that India sounds more attractive than PH when it comes to living cost :3
[17:43:40] <amigojapan> Ouch Terminus 
[17:43:53] <Terminus> our cool months are really just december and january. maybe half of february too.
[17:44:21] <Sadale> Take bath with water :3
[17:44:26] <zoidberg> Yeah Sadale. We get minimum bill as we have two meters. One floor my parents live and another floor, only me.
[17:44:30] <Sadale> May help cooling down
[17:44:35] <Bco1981> Terminus: Nut November ?
[17:44:55] <Sadale> zoidberg, cool!
[17:45:03] <Terminus> Bco1981: nope. november is still too warm plus the possibility of a category 5 storm.
[17:45:19] <Bco1981> then atleast there is some wind...
[17:45:25] <Sadale> LOL
[17:45:28] <Terminus> hell, category 5 storm last december 16, 2021.
[17:45:28] <Sadale> You don't want that kind of wind
[17:45:30] <zoidberg> Nah, DDD December, lol
[17:45:32] <Sadale> Especially in PH
[17:45:40] <zoidberg> DDD*
[17:45:53] <Sadale> We're pretty much safe with storm here in HK tho. Buildings here are built to withstand that
[17:45:59] <Terminus> Bco1981: you've probably never been in a category 5 storm. =P
[17:46:12] <amigojapan> Terminus: yeah that really surprised me
[17:46:22] <Bco1981> nope, worst we had here is some 15meter/second winds
[17:46:47] <Terminus> Sadale: storms typically get weaker by the time they get to HK. you still have flooding though. but i've experienced a couple of storms there too. but HK keeps the trains running anyway. =D
[17:47:02] <zoidberg> Sadale: the oceans are warming up and this means more wild weather in the coastal regions. I‚Äôm not sure how worse it gets by the time you retire. Heads up!
[17:47:07] <Sadale> Terminus, nope. At higher storm level trains stop running.
[17:47:48] <Sadale> Terminus, oh actually I think it's just the part of the metro that has outdoor tracks would stop running.
[17:47:52] <amigojapan> Terminus: Japan stops trains depending on the force of the storm
[17:48:01] <Terminus> Sadale: they actually did stop the trains in the morning when i was there but it was running by afternoon. that was the day we met actually. we went to you once we found out the trains were running again. üòÄ
[17:48:02] <Sadale> Terminus, so, yes. Train keeps running. Kind of.
[17:48:34] <Terminus> Sadale: bottom line. HK keeps trains running in more severe weather than we do i think.
[17:48:41] <Sadale> Terminus, yeah now that I remember. The day we met was having a typhoon signal number 10. That's the highest signal here.
[17:49:03] <zoidberg> amigojapan: Japan has trains working on the next day of Hiroshima incident. That was something.
[17:49:04] <Terminus> Sadale: yep. and us being from the PH, we go out and we're like, weather's fine. ü§£
[17:49:12] <Sadale> Terminus, And I didn't have to get to work because of the typhoon that day xD
[17:49:36] <amigojapan> Zoidberg you mean the nuclear bomb?
[17:49:42] <Terminus> Sadale: yep! it was the perfect time to meet and eat noodles! hahaha
[17:49:45] <Sadale> Terminus, I'm surprised as well. signal #10 doesn't look like that most of the time. xD Perhaps it's just that HK being physically big and some part of it was indeed dangerous
[17:49:49] <zoidberg> Sadale: you don‚Äôt need trains lol. You‚Äôd hardly go out.
[17:49:57] <Sadale> zoidberg, lol true
[17:50:09] <zoidberg> Yes amigojapan. I heard that in a podcast.
[17:50:12] <Sadale> I just need a typhoon-resistant home in PH so that I could live there for real cheap :3
[17:50:20] <Terminus> Sadale: Lantau probably had flooding. we just got wind at TST.
[17:50:29] <Sadale> Actually typhoon + earthquake-proof housing

[17:50:39] <amigojapan> Zoidberg sounds fishy, half the city was obliterated
[17:50:40] <Sadale> zoidberg, lol
[17:50:51] <Sadale> zoidberg, Or even, just purchase a tank and live inside
[17:51:08] <Sadale> Then I could run away in case I encounter cops.
[17:51:11] <zoidberg> I mean not in the city amigojapan. I think elsewhere in Japan.
[17:51:15] * ButterNoodle puts Sadale in a fish tank
[17:51:17] <Sadale> bunker can't move. Tank can.
[17:51:24] * Sadale drowns :3
[17:51:37] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, PM lol
[17:51:37] * ButterNoodle gives Sadale mouth to mouth
[17:51:43] <Terminus> Sadale: live in olongapo or dagupan and you'll probably be fine. as long as there's fiber. fiber is the most important thing to have!
[17:51:43] <Sadale> ew
[17:51:49] <zoidberg> Sadale: and then sit on the tanks and eat cakes
[17:52:05] <Sadale> Terminus, I don't even have fiber here right now. But the broadband is ok xD
[17:52:06] <amigojapan> Zoidberg sure, if it is not related, nuclear bomb is local
[17:52:20] <Sadale> Terminus, I think I could get fiber here if I'm willing to pay more tho
[17:53:14] <amigojapan> Zoidberg tomako wants me to PM you, is it ok?
[17:53:16] <zoidberg> Still, it‚Äôs kind of huge deal and how everything gone back to normal on just the next day after a bomb had been dropped amigojapan, that‚Äôs something.
[17:53:17] <Terminus> Sadale: i get 300/300 mbps on my fiber for $38/mo. my phone gets 75 mbps.
[17:53:25] <zoidberg> Sure amigojapan
[17:53:25] <Sadale> Terminus, lucky you
[17:53:39] <Sadale> Terminus, how much is a 2 bedroom condo tthere in olongapo or dagupan?
[17:54:08] <Terminus> Sadale: no idea. never been to dagupan and i haven't been to olongapo in like 30 years. ü§£
[17:54:45] <Terminus> but they're probably safer than other cities when it comes to storms.
[17:54:55] <Terminus> or just live in the greater metro manila area but more expensive.

[17:57:14] <Terminus> but most important is be on high ground. there's a lot of destruction if you're flooded.

[18:03:51] <Sadale> Terminus, why'd living in the western side help then? The typhoon would be weakened when it lands?

[18:18:32] * Sadale checks the rent
[18:18:54] <Sadale> $500 rent. A bit on the expensive side but not too bad
[18:20:11] <Sadale> Terminus, apparently renting would be far less risky than buying.
[18:20:32] <Sadale> hmm but the rent could raise :/
[18:22:26] <Sadale> and the landlord could just stop leasing the house/condo. Then I'd have to move out. That's much hassles :/
[18:22:26] <Terminus> Sadale: there's a $350 condo i think. or just buy a condo for $45k. if you have $45k now. property values are rising fast.
[18:23:30] <Sadale> Terminus, I do have $45k now. But that'd be rather risky to me to buy PH housing as $45k is rather expensive to me.
[18:23:55] <Sadale> Terminus, And assuming that I'm leasing it out, I can't just collect rent there easily while I'm in HK. :/
[18:24:18] <Terminus> Sadale: plenty of foreigners buying condos here. it's only going to go up.
[18:24:53] <Sadale> Terminus, same goes here in HK. People just love buying condo here. And the value keeps rising. I actually don't believe that its value would keep rising forever tho with declining population and shit.
[18:25:00] <Sadale> Terminus, Not sure on the situation on PH.
[18:25:01] <Terminus> i was looking at a $400k condo 10 years ago. they're now $1M condos.
[18:25:19] <Sadale> ah. That's on par with NASDAQ100 return.
[18:25:40] <Terminus> this was in a highly desirable area.
[18:25:50] <Sadale> IIRC NASDAQ100 is like, maybee 10-15% return per year. oh. But you get to collect the rent for housing. So it's better than NASDAQ100.
[18:26:17] <Sadale> Terminus, serious question. Is that feasible for foreigner condo owner there to collect rents?
[18:26:45] <analoq> i wonder what the evergrande bankrupcy is going to do to the housing market
[18:26:58] <Terminus> Sadale: leave it to an agent. they'll collect for you. they'll take a cut of course.
[18:27:16] <Sadale> Terminus, I see. any idea on how much cut they'd take. :/
[18:27:22] <Terminus> nope
[18:27:32] <Sadale> Terminus, ah. not surprising as you're a local there.
[18:28:00] <Sadale> Terminus, I dunno. I just find the idea of buying house without even physically visiting there a very risky idea. At minimum you'd need lawyer and shit to ensure that you actually own the condo.
[18:28:05] <Terminus> Sadale: more extreme example. i have relatives who bought lots for $50k 40 years ago. they're now $20M homes.

[18:37:03] <Sadale> If I take a Mandarin-speaking job, I'd have to fake it until I make it. xD I could actually make it with enough training tho.
[18:37:16] <Terminus> i met a guy years ago. was offered $3.5k/mo for his 1st job just because he can speak mandarin.
[18:37:18] <Sadale> When you say that it pays a lot, like, how much?
[18:37:35] <Sadale> pffft
[18:37:41] <Sadale> $3.5k ain't that much
[18:37:44] <Terminus> $3.5k/mo, not engineering. engineering should pay more.
[18:37:52] <Bco1981> Sadale: is there one of the two that are concidere the "main" chinese variant? like there is a majority that speaks one of them ? or is it close to 50/50 ?
[18:37:54] <ButterNoodle> ...
[18:38:04] <Terminus> $3.5k can buy you a lot, especially if you only spend $1k on rent.
[18:38:22] <analoq> MORE
[18:38:26] <analoq> MOOOORE
[18:38:31] <Sadale> Bco1981, Mandarin is the standard Chinese being used in China. It's used by almost all of the Chinese population. Most of the regions has their own dialects tho.
[18:38:32] <Bco1981> analoq: no more!
[18:38:34] <ButterNoodle> I'd die on that
[18:38:34] <Terminus> you have a brand new high end PC every month with the money left over.
[18:38:49] <Bco1981> Sadale: ah okay
[18:39:06] <ButterNoodle> Terminus: can u eat a high end PC?
[18:39:09] <analoq> Terminus: thats not even buying you a highend gpu these days :P
[18:39:18] <Sadale> Bco1981, Back in the days (maybe 80s and 90s?) mainland China were poor af. And it was Hong Kong (China) that's being an economical and cultural center. And Cantonese's being used in Hong Kong (China)
[18:39:22] <Terminus> analoq: fine. every 2 months. =P
[18:39:23] <Bco1981> ButterNoodle: yaaaas... BEEF PC!
[18:39:45] <Terminus> ButterNoodle: i mean, if you spend all your money on a high end PC and have no money left over for food, that's your fault. =P
[18:39:58] <ButterNoodle> yea
[18:40:11] <Sadale> actually I could buy a decent PC every month here as well if I want to. But I'd rather to save up money for retirement xD
[18:40:21] <analoq> Sadale: you are like the arians of china. the problem is the peasants don't see it that way :P
[18:40:30] <ButterNoodle> giving away 1/3 ur income to stay out of the elements should be criminal tbh
[18:40:33] <Bco1981> Terminus: wait wait wait... 3.5K and only 1K for rent... that leaves only 2.5k... you only get a gpu for that.
[18:40:52] <Sadale> Terminus, anyway if you're talking about communication and shit, I'm not so good at that. I mainly shine in technical skill as of today.
[18:40:54] <Terminus> you can spend $1800/mo eating at restaurants if you want.
[18:41:12] <beaky> $1800/mo superchatting vtuber
[18:41:18] <Terminus> Bco1981: yeah, i revised it to every 2 months.
[18:41:24] <Bco1981> ah
[18:41:31] <Sadale> Terminus, so my objective is to try saving up money in the shortest time as possible. I don't think moving to PH for work would be the way to go
[18:41:41] <Sadale> Moving to the US sounds more plausible for that purpose :P
[18:42:13] <analoq> yeah high paying job, no insurances and roll the dice
[18:42:27] <Terminus> Sadale: remote work. plenty of people do it. i know a guy in thailand who does purely remote work. he charges $700/day.
[18:42:30] <Sadale> And don't forget that I'm living with parents here. So it does save me quite a bit of money
[18:42:43] <Sadale> Terminus, woah. freelancer or day job? :/
[18:42:57] <Sadale> No way that a day job would be able to consistently provide $700/day
[18:43:02] <Terminus> i'm just saying, $3.5k/mo can buy you a lot when you're living alone here.
[18:43:12] <Terminus> Sadale: freelance but he seems quite busy.
[18:43:26] <Sadale> I see. nah that's not the kind of live I'm looking for

[18:45:33] <Sadale> true

[19:00:01] <Sadale> Terminus, I thought that 4 hours would be "near" as per your definition
[19:00:13] <MootPoot> lol
[19:00:22] <MootPoot> Sadale: are you supposed to use it on a plane?
[19:00:33] <Sadale> MootPoot, lol probably not
[19:00:35] <Terminus> Sadale: good luck buying nice stuff because that means you're either in a terrible location in manila or you're in the middle of bumfuck nowhere.
[19:00:43] <Sadale> MootPoot, it probably means that it's travel-friendly
[19:00:48] <MootPoot> imagine the airport guards burst into your airplane bathroom thinking you're making a bomb

[19:02:43] <Terminus> without traffic, it takes me 15 minutes to drive to the airport. with traffic, as much as an hour. there hasn't been much traffic for 2 years though.

[19:11:34] <Terminus> Sadale: actually, correction. you can be 4 hours away from the airport in greater metro manila and still get packages delivered fast. outside of manila in the middle of nowhere, it can take a long time.
[19:11:58] <Sadale> Terminus, ah. :(
[19:12:32] <Terminus> Sadale: domestic airports count as long as direct flights to manila are available. preferably with an A320.

[19:13:32] <Sadale> ok. Now I know how I could pick a city. It'd just take me time to find out all the cities that satisfy the requriements. Then I'd pick the one that has the lowest living cost. :P
[19:14:03] <Sadale> Or I could just stick with metro Manila with a disaster-proof location and call it good.
[19:14:27] <Terminus> which doesn't leave a lot of cities. you've got laoag, bacolod, iloilo, cebu, CDO, davao. i'm leaving out cities you want to avoid because of typhoons.
[19:14:43] <Sadale> Considered that it'd be easier to meet users like Terminus or ezekiel it may actually be a better idea to stick with Metro Manila :P
[19:15:13] <Terminus> yes, manila with $1.5k rent means you'll have all the conveniences.
[19:15:17] <Sadale> iloilo sounds interesting. ilo means "device" or "tool" in toki pona language
[19:15:21] <Sadale> pffft
[19:15:28] <Sadale> no thanks. $1.5k is far too much
[19:15:42] <Terminus> can go cheaper even. i think houses in my area can still be rented for $1k.
[19:15:44] <Sadale> I could rent in HK with $1.5k. No way that I'd go there
[19:17:00] <Terminus> $500 in manila will get you maybe 24 m^2 room. good location not guaranteed.
[19:17:24] <Terminus> actually, very high probability of flooding.
[19:17:26] <Sadale> Now that's better.
[19:17:28] <Sadale> oh
[19:20:19] <Sadale> Terminus, as a rent tentant tho what'd be the problem of flooding? The house/apartment ain't yours.
[19:20:46] <Sadale> At least that'd be less bad than owning an apartment that get flooded.

[19:34:33] <Terminus> locally i mean. internationally it's worse. maybe 180ms for cellular while i get 50ms on fiber.

[20:56:39] <MootPoot> the moca 2.5 adapters I h ave support 2.5gbit throughput

[20:57:26] <MootPoot> not sure about that
[20:57:40] <MootPoot> but the ethernet speed is there
[20:57:53] <MootPoot> think its 2.5gbit overall
[20:57:55] <zoidberg> I never heard such a thing MootPoot 
[20:59:20] <MootPoot> yeah according to a fourm post, its 2.5gbit overall
[20:59:28] <MootPoot> so 1.25 
[20:59:52] <MootPoot> I think
[20:59:54] <MootPoot> idk
[21:00:18] <MootPoot> either way it saturates my 1gbit ethernet so its good enough for me, especially since I dont even have wiring for faster then that

[21:00:35] <MootPoot> everything shows up except the exsi box
[21:01:11] <Bco1981> well as long as it can max 1gbit one way. it's rare that you need 1gbit in both directions at once.
[21:02:35] <MootPoot> the latency maybe I need to do a power button hold type reboot
[21:02:37] <MootPoot> or something
[21:02:38] <MootPoot> idk

[21:04:53] <MootPoot> Bco1981: should I connect all the ports on the back to the swtich
[21:05:03] <MootPoot> it has  4 rj45 ports but I only am using 1 atm
[21:05:14] <Imalaia3> \
[21:05:45] <Bco1981> if it flashes like crazy on all ports you might want to remove the ones you don't use
[21:06:06] <Bco1981> you might be creating a network loop.
[21:06:18] <HubertFarnsworth> I'm not sure. I thought full duplex can't be done through coax. Is it possible Bco1981?
[21:06:42] <MootPoot> well right now its flashing correctly on the switch side and the dell side
[21:06:46] <MootPoot> so idk why its not connecting
[21:07:10] <Bco1981> HubertFarnsworth: i'm not sure either, normally in ethernet terms, that one cable is one single collision domain, so packets in both directions at once would collide.
[21:08:19] <HubertFarnsworth> Bco1981: yeah, that's what I thought too. Only half duplex is possible through coax.
[21:08:23] <Bco1981> well frames really.
[21:08:47] <HubertFarnsworth> have the coax cables changed?
[21:09:04] <Bco1981> idk, maybe
[21:09:08] <MootPoot> idk, maybe you can do it if you have different freqencies
[21:09:25] <MootPoot> like right now I'm running both DOCSIS 3.1 and MoCa through my coax cables
[21:09:34] <MootPoot> DOSCIS works at like under 1.1ghz 
[21:09:40] <MootPoot> and MoCa above that
[21:09:44] <MootPoot> so they dont clash
[21:10:04] <MootPoot> presumably if you had your frequencies far apart enough you could pull it off if this already works
[21:10:31] <MootPoot> I've heard of triple packages some ISPs offer globally as well - cable TV, internet, and phone all through one coax on different frequency ranges
[21:10:32] <Bco1981> well true, docsis send and receive on the same coax.

[21:11:21] <MootPoot> I had to insteall a low pass filter to make sure the MoCa was contained since it dosent have any authentication
[21:11:30] <MootPoot> it just connects to any other moca adapter it finds
[21:11:40] <Bco1981> lol
[21:12:02] <MootPoot> so you have to use  a hardware blocking filter - blocks anything above 1ghz to make sure your moca does not hook up with your neighbours 
[21:12:28] <HubertFarnsworth> hmm, technically it is possible to both transmit and receive at the same time with different frequencies...what say Bco1981?
[21:12:31] <MootPoot> my ISP dosen't use any DOCSIS freqency higher then about 850mhz so it worked out perfectly to me
[21:12:50] <Bco1981> HubertFarnsworth: that is how DOCSIS do it... i forgot.
[21:13:38] <HubertFarnsworth> I don't even remember docsis

[22:21:24] <Bco1981> yeah, that would cause a netsplit too, but on this side we didn't disconnect from the server.

[23:00:26] * ImoutoBot welcomes S‚Äã_T_A_N (7 / 32): <S‚Äã_T_A_N> In a world where no means yes and yes means harder, one man must make the greatest sacrifice man can make.
[23:06:20] <ButterNoodle> S_T_A_N: try 1:2 - dont make large changes to dose or output
[23:07:18] <S_T_A_N> lol
[23:07:55] <S_T_A_N> your advice is all the fuck over the place
[23:08:27] <ButterNoodle> ??
[23:08:41] <ButterNoodle> I was trying to get u to 1:2 last night
[23:10:08] <ButterNoodle> new bag of coffee should start out at the gr capacity of the basket and 2x that to get a good starting point
[23:11:47] <S_T_A_N> lol no you weren't
[23:11:52] <ButterNoodle> then adjust time to bring strength away from the long shot and get it closer to ristretto depending on taste
[23:11:58] *** Joins: axujen (~quassel@107.175.134.198)
[23:12:05] <S_T_A_N> You were talling me to do 18 in 28-30 out
[23:12:48] <ButterNoodle> 18 -> 30 is normal actually
[23:13:14] <S_T_A_N> That isn't 1:2
[23:13:15] <ButterNoodle> but if ur channeling is controlled u can run a long shot
[23:13:45] <ButterNoodle> yea thats more 1:1.6-7
[23:14:14] <ButterNoodle> below 1:1.5 is considered a short shot/ristretto
[23:14:21] <ButterNoodle> above 1:2 is a long shot
[23:14:33] <ButterNoodle> which will be more bitter
[23:14:37] <S_T_A_N> lol it's fine. new beans tomorrow
[23:15:30] <S_T_A_N> only about 6 shots worth though lol
[23:16:48] <ButterNoodle> *I probably forgot where u were at last night tbh..
[23:17:13] <ButterNoodle> but that 18->30 is where most people start dialing in a commercial machine
[23:17:54] <ButterNoodle> if its chalky probably need to go up in water a few grams
[23:17:57] * Jigsy dials up to 11.
[23:18:44] <ButterNoodle> the problem being that is not just a sliding scale.. but 5 sliding scales that make a shot
[23:24:29] <Jigsy> Commoners eat Magic Mushrooms.
[23:24:34] <Jigsy> Rich people eat Magic Truffles.
[23:24:39] <Jigsy> Yeah, wrap your head around that.
