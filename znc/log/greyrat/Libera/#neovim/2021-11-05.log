[00:36:25] <irc_user> What would be the easiest way to map `<c-n>` to do an insertion-only fuzzy match? For example, I want `hw<c-n>` to expand to `hello_world`, assuming the latter is present in the file. Would I use lua for something like this?
[00:37:05] <ii14[m]> what do you mean, like fuzzy snippets?

[00:38:11] <irc_user> Oh sorry, I meant to say fuzzy completion.

[00:39:46] <ii14[m]> sure, why not

[01:07:22] <anihm136[m]> Does anyone know of a way to enter/exit insert mode without triggering autocommands? `noautocmd startinsert` does not seem to work
[01:09:38] <anihm136[m]> To explain a little more, here is the situation - I'm in insert mode, and I need to temporarily leave insert mode, do something and get back to insert mode. However, this needs to be 'transparent' to the user, so I'd like to avoid triggering insert mode-related autocommands when that happens
[01:11:08] <ii14[m]> how is this action triggered?

[01:20:07] <ii14[m]> just map it to `<cmd>call some_function()<cr>`

[01:20:28] <ii14[m]> at least not insertleave

[01:25:14] <sunjonSenghanBri> try `eventignore`
[01:25:54] <ii14[m]> how do you set it for just one thing though?
[01:26:01] <ii14[m]> for one particular mapping
[01:26:20] <anihm136[m]> Yeah I've been messing around with eventignore for the better part of two hours now. The problem I keep facing is that at some point I need to reset it to its original value, and then re-entering insert mode triggers `InsertEnter`
[01:26:33] <sunjonSenghanBri> set it when the function is called and restore it at the end;16u
[01:26:49] <ii14[m]> but how do you call a function in the first place?
[01:26:57] <ii14[m]> you have to exit insert mode
[01:27:29] <sunjonSenghanBri> true
[01:28:23] <ii14[m]> maybe what you could do is disable InsertLeave entirely and trigger the event manually through remapping everything that exits insertmode
[01:28:30] <ii14[m]> that's complicated though
[01:29:09] <ii14[m]> and won't be friendly to other plugins and custom mappings
[01:30:09] <anihm136[m]> Oh wait I still haven't explained myself completely. So the insert mode mapping calls an expression (`<C-r>=`), which does not trigger insert autocmds. The function called then performs some actions, and returns a string of keys, which may include `<Esc>`. So what I've been working with now is to set eventignore at the beginning, and append a command to reset it at the end of the returned string. The issue here is that at the end, after
[01:30:09] <anihm136[m]> resetting eventignore, we come back to insert mode, triggering insertenter
[01:30:21] <anihm136[m]> I was hoping `noautocmd` would work for that but it does not
[01:31:01] <ii14[m]> right, I completely forgot about `<c-r>=`

[19:13:56] <harshsharma[m]> ii14: I thought if you add more than one folder per workspace (one for a project that has symbol, and another for the project that has implementation), then a go to implementation is possible from one project to another. I think I got it wrong?

[19:17:22] <mjlbach[m]> But sending root directory to the server as the parent directory (or cwd) is a hack around lspconfig’s design
[19:19:11] <clason[m]> I have no skin in the game for `ltex-ls` (I don't use it, nor do I want to); I only care that `texlab` keeps working like it does.

[20:36:28] <mh72[m]> Hello, does anyone know when using pyright as lsp, whether you can somehow specify the pyrightconfig.json globally? With the pyright binary you can use "pyright -p /home/linux/pyrightconfig.json" for instance, but lspconfig uses the pyright-langserver binary and I can't seem to find a way to make it work with that.
[20:36:29] <mh72[m]> Thank you!
[20:37:58] <saltrocklamp[m]> mh72[m]: you can change the command that's used to invoke the language server
[20:38:14] <saltrocklamp[m]> so you can add options there
[20:38:39] <clason[m]> in particular, if you installed `pyright-langserver` as suggested, you can use the `pyright` command
[20:39:08] <clason[m]> (it's not default because the wrapper looks slower at starting up)
[20:40:05] <mh72[m]> Oh I see, thanks, so in https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/lua/lspconfig/pyright.lua at ```local server_name = 'pyright'
[20:40:05] <mh72[m]> local bin_name = 'pyright-langserver'``` I can change that bin_name to pyright instead without harm down the road?
[20:40:06] <clason[m]> so add `cmd = {'pyright', '-p', '<json>'}` to your config

[20:40:36] <clason[m]> I don't know enough about pyright to answer that, but you can just try it :)
[20:40:47] <mh72[m]> Alright will do that, thanks so much!
[20:41:47] <clason[m]> Reading a bit more, I'm skeptical, though -- `pyright` seems to be the stand-alone linter tool, which is _not_ a language server
[20:44:33] <mh72[m]> Oh alright... I'm trying to avoid the issue where I have to put a pyrightconfig.json file in each directory I'm working in, would rather have a global config file (there's an issue on this at the Microsoft repo at  https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/issues/176 ) - I want it to scan only my open files which I specified in the pyrightconfig else my pc starts overheating.
[20:45:18] <mh72[m]> so I set "diagnosticMode": "openFilesOnly", but as far as I know I can't pass that parameter directly into neovim
[20:45:31] <mh72[m]> ah I can actually use that one
[20:45:36] <clason[m]> well, if pyright doesn't support this, then you're out of luck

[21:56:31] <mjlbach[m]> I just meant for the future
[21:56:42] <phaazon[m]> that’s probably true
[21:56:44] <mjlbach[m]> tbh basically anyone who uses master should subscribe to that issue
[21:57:03] <phaazon[m]> I don’t use `master`
[21:57:04] <phaazon[m]> that’s why I didn’t see it in the first place
[21:57:09] <phaazon[m]> it’s a nightly user who reported that issue to Hop 
[21:57:21] <phaazon[m]> (but now I’m running on `master` too…)
[21:57:23] <ii14[m]> phaazon: what's that vertical line/pipe symbol in the sign column?
[21:57:42] <phaazon[m]> ii14[m]: git diff
[21:57:59] <ii14[m]> ok, thanks
[21:58:36] <phaazon[m]> also, I should remove the diagnostics from the sign column
[21:58:37] <phaazon[m]> I really dislike them 😀
[21:58:59] <mjlbach[m]> It's super easy to disable
[21:59:00] <phaazon[m]> and also, at some time, I will make a PR to allow to move the sign column at the right side of the number and make it width = 1
[21:59:43] <mjlbach[m]> I want to do right-aligned diagnostics at some point
[21:59:45] <mjlbach[m]> I think it would look cleaner
[21:59:54] <phaazon[m]> like what emacs does?
[22:00:05] <mjlbach[m]> yeah
[22:00:10] <phaazon[m]> I agree it looks nicer
[22:00:17] <mjlbach[m]> less info though
[22:00:22] <ii14[m]> on the topic of diagnostics, aren't they displayed in virtual text in the opposite order, the last diagnostic first?
[22:00:25] <mjlbach[m]> We could do it with virtual lines
[22:00:39] <bfredl> you can do right aligned already
[22:00:41] <ii14[m]> seems to me like the first error is the most important one
[22:00:43] <bfredl> its a flag for virtual text
[22:00:43] <mjlbach[m]> Yeah I know
[22:01:07] <mjlbach[m]> I think it would be nice to column align them and add virtual lines placeholders for the overflow
[22:01:36] <mjlbach[m]> ii14: it's customizable 
[22:01:52] <ii14[m]> cool, I'll look into that
[22:02:13] <ii14[m]> also, will there be at some point option to display them between lines? we can do that now, right?
[22:02:19] <ii14[m]> with virtual text

[23:09:33] <clason[m]> you might do something with `iskeyword`

[23:37:20] <mh72[m]> haven't used magsafe yet ironically because the battery is so good that I don't need to charge it any time I'm somewhere where someone could trip over the cable
[23:37:46] <sunjonSenghanBri> can you magsafe usb-c ? :]
[23:37:48] <clason[m]> (I'll be skipping this generation, but I'm very curious about next year's machines: the new iMac27, and the new MBAs, both of which I might be in the market for)
[23:37:49] <mh72[m]> only charge it through USB C at my desk
[23:37:59] <clason[m]> same (have an USB-C monitor)
[23:38:18] <neovim[m]> sunjonSenghanBri: sorta, there are adapters I think
[23:38:22] <clason[m]> (which is pretty nice)
[23:38:23] <neovim[m]> but like, not great

[23:56:11] <jaawerth[m]> ooh if I had one of those I could leave my work macbook plugged into it without it irritating me with a constant sleep-wake cycle
[23:56:46] <jaawerth[m]> (there's probably something programmery I could be doing to prevent this but I instead choose to rage at it and try to remember to unplug the HDMI)
