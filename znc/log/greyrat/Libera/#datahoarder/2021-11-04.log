[00:58:50] <ThePendulum> I ssh'd into the camera, nice lol, unfortunately it doesn't seem to offer anything to generate an ssh key there either

[01:54:01] <rmmh> er, cassette
[01:54:01] <rawktucc> except
[01:54:10] <rawktucc> read that hn thread. there's discussion on what that doesny work
[01:54:16] <rawktucc> it's gonna be at least 1K for the lto-8 drive.
[01:54:25] <rawktucc> and then I have to constantly keep up with newer drives or I lose my data
[01:54:37] <rawktucc> oh lto-8?? ok, 2-4K for the drive alone
[01:54:45] <rmmh> the LTO ecosystem is much healthier than BD, though
[01:54:53] <rawktucc> wdym healthy?

[01:55:04] <rawktucc> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29097851
[01:55:10] <rawktucc> sure but still, you have to keep up
[01:55:30] <rawktucc> I could buy two bluray drives, a 25 pack of these 128GB discs. burn a whole pack, store them with the drive, and let it on a shelf for 10 years
[01:55:32] <rawktucc> still good
[01:55:40] <rawktucc> SATA isn't going away anytime soon I bet... but we'll see
[01:55:52] <rmmh> you'll still be able to get LTO-{8,9,10} drives in 10 years
[01:55:53] <rawktucc> until NVME pricing crashes bigger HDDs still coming
[01:55:58] <rmmh> they might just be used
[01:55:59] <rawktucc> sus
[01:56:04] <rawktucc> oh but
[01:56:07] <rmmh> yeah idk, they're both kind of exotic for the average datahoarder
[01:56:09] <rawktucc> you have to climate control LTO tapes
[01:56:12] <rmmh> you can find arguments for both
[01:56:22] <rawktucc> my ideal is that I have some files I literally never want to lose. impossible to replace

[05:41:51] <Spring> When I tested years ago with same options Handbrake was faster (on Intel), though I normally use ffmpeg since I have a script set up for it. When I asked on the ffmpeg channel they thought it was either HW accelerated decoding was being used by Handbrake, or it was better optimized than the ffmpeg CLI, or some some unexplained subtle difference.

[09:33:49] <cads> in order to hoard more, I must read exponentially more
[09:34:23] <cads> to read more, I must convert documents to speech
[09:36:04] <cads> it turns out, however, that I need neural speech services to actually understand the speech. If I use old PDF to voice converters, I miss words and begin to fatigue while listening
[09:36:26] <cads> does anyone know if a pdf reader exists that can read science papers using neural speech?

[11:08:31] <cads> however I have high hopes that assistive techs will allow lots of folks to access science knowledge that would otherwise rot in digital archives for another hundred years
[11:09:16] <skye0> i have hopes that technology will improve. i don't have hopes that it'll open up any time soon with like licensing
[11:09:32] <cads> lol
[11:09:52] <cads> similarly I have given up on mozvoice 
[11:10:47] <cads> I honestly have more hope that some hotshot is going to publish a model that is just so good that anyone with a 8gb GPU can train it in a week or two, and it also beats the state of the art
[11:11:09] <cads> I suppose such thinking can be called dreaming, or a delusion if I actually believed it
[11:11:43] <skye0> hopefully that comes through soon
[11:11:53] <cads> another idea is that we build a blockchain where to mine, you have to help train a community oriented AI, such as the speech engine
[11:12:42] <cads> all the AIs that the blockchain produces belong to humanity, and the goal is to produce a source code library that can end scarcity
[11:13:27] <cads> imo a few million miners could crank out the equivalent of GPT3 in a weekend
[11:14:10] <cads> the only reason the corps are owning these results and not us is that they have the compute... but we all have the compute to compete with that, idling on our desks
[11:16:34] <cads> I suppose having those phds on the payroll helps, but tbh if the pdhs had access to the compute they need, wouldn't they use it even if they weren't salaried?

[19:06:27] <ThePendulum> ok apparently the IP camera HAS been recording to our NAS, but it's taking the remote directory relative to the home directory
[19:06:43] <ThePendulum> so when I put /stash/pendulum it was actually writing to /home/pendulum/stash/pendulum
[19:07:30] <ThePendulum> this thing uses the most annoying filepaths https://i.imgur.com/8VbhVo7.png

[19:09:23] <Allie> that sounds backwards, you should not be recording on-camera to network storage
[19:09:29] <Allie> you should be streaming from the cameras to an NVR
[19:11:46] *** Joins: Sgeo (~Sgeo@user/sgeo)
[19:12:50] <ThePendulum> why?
[19:14:17] <ThePendulum> don't see why I would get a dedicated device that doesn't do anything the home server can't do, it's only 1 camera
[19:22:04] <ThePendulum> not even sure how you would define the difference between an NVR and a NAS with some tools installed
[19:24:54] <ThePendulum> if I wanted to avoid relying on the camera's own motion detection etc. I'd install zoneminder on the NAS, but it's actually quite good. did consider setting up zoneminder on a dedicated pi or odroid at my sister's house, but atm there doesn't really seem to be much of a point
[19:27:37] <ThePendulum> if we're talking 10-40 cameras I can imagine it might be cheaper to get an NVR that has dedicated video processing so you don't need to tons of CPU and RAM overhead, but it's 1 camera and almost certainly never going to be more than 2, and it has a web interface for live viewing, and an app that can do multiple at once

[19:36:04] <Pea> I like the image recognition in home cctv systems, we have one that can identify people and cars. Kinda nice especially when looking at alerts to see people who triggered a motion event.

[19:44:19] <ThePendulum> yeah this one can do tons of fancy stuff like that too, saw something like tracking groups larger than a certain number of people
[19:44:48] <ThePendulum> much nicer than the cameras we have in our house, unfortunately my sister really has a reason to have one atm
[19:45:25] <ThePendulum> some relatives smashed in the windshield of her boyfriend's car a couple weeks after shooting at it with a bb gun, and just today they smashed the windows of his parents' house
[19:52:29] <ThePendulum> this one is a Dahua, the ones we have are some cheap Eminents without any real interface and an app that hasn't been updated in half a decade, at least it has rtsp

[20:17:15] <Allie> ThePendulum: your NAS can be your NVR
[20:17:24] <Allie> but your camera shouldn't be the thing turning frames into files
[20:17:49] <Allie> it's a very shonky moving part
[20:18:06] <Allie> and if you actually lose the camera, you probably care about the integrity of that particular file
[20:22:38] <evilgohan2> agree. MJPEG stream and the receiver should be doing the writing
[20:33:20] <Myself> For sure, but once in a while you just have to put the camera on wifi and wifi goes out sometimes. I'd rather have local recording as a secondary option than none at all.
