[04:55:37] <Aelius> hey all. I'm trying to install the sunshine host (foss nvidia gamestream host for moonlight clients) on my headless server. In order to get it to run I have the following command:

[04:55:55] <Aelius> I can connect and it all looks good, but mouse/keyboard do not work
[04:56:25] <Aelius> if you ls .config/sunshine you see files like 'sunshine_keyboard -> /dev/input/event14'

[09:59:21] <jmcantrell> I'm reading https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Python_package_guidelines and it says that during check(), I can just run pytest. Does this assume that the module(s) being tested are in the root of the project and not in a src directory? Because my project is in the latter category and I had to set PYTHONPATH=$PWD/src for pytest to work. Is this the proper way to handle this?

[10:47:25] <nl6720> the log shows "gpg: Good signature from "Pierre Schmitz <pierre@archlinux.de>" [unknown]"
[10:47:43] <up_running> I downloaded the torrent and the checksum file from the Arch download page.

[10:50:48] <up_running> rcf: What do you mean by "checksum_type"?
[10:50:51] <rcf> $PATH_TO_ISO is self-explanatory, for $CHECKSUM_TYPE MD5 and SHA1 are given on the download page for quick verification 
[10:51:50] <up_running> rcf: great! that seems to have worked!
[10:52:12] <up_running> Is there any way to update the installation guide with this alternate method?
[10:52:35] <up_running> I'll do it myself if there is a link on how to update it.
[10:52:44] <rcf> If there are Windows-specific instructions somewhere this could be included 
[10:53:05] <up_running> I'd like to save future users the frustration about this process on Windows.
[10:53:05] <rcf> If there aren't Windows-specific instructions it probably wouldn't be deemed relevant. 
[10:53:47] <up_running> rcf: There are no Windows-specific instructions, so I guess I'll just keep it in my notes then. 
[10:54:51] <rcf> up_running: pgp signatures are the proper stnadard for validation obviously. But keep in mind that if you trust the mirror operator and are using https it's somewhat superfluous 
[10:55:02] <up_running> nl6720: But just for the record, I'd like to understand the Kleopatra method since the installation guide seems to assume some setup like that.

[10:59:13] <nl6720> I guess what kleopatra doesn't like, is that the key is not locally signed
[11:00:29] <up_running> nl6720: I don't see any blue link next to the Decrypt/Verify icon.
[11:01:01] <nl6720> nah, it's in the window after selecting the .sig file
[11:01:44] <up_running> Now, I see what I was doing incorrectly! 
[11:01:46] <up_running> I didn't have the .sig file and the .iso file in the same location.

[11:04:36] <nl6720> up_running: yes

[11:05:54] <nl6720> up_running: ignore that
[11:06:25] <up_running> The current PGP fingerprint list only has one match for the RSA key Kleopatra gave me.

[11:07:14] <rcf> I mean if it didn't expire it's fine 
[11:07:16] <up_running> What are all the other keys on that page then?

[17:13:03] <sharktamer> not the case this time luckily
[17:13:08] <hiya> jelle: mount the system partitions? Should I try with grub at all? Or systemd-boot works isn't the bug?
[17:13:09] <sharktamer> let's see if it continues to be happy though

Once you've memorized the process flow from the Installation Guide, and practiced a few times (perhaps in a VM), you never should be more than 15-20 minutes away from a clean install, done correctly :)

[17:34:59] <hashworks> Sooo, I have a mdadm RAID6 consisting of 10x 6TB drives that I need to shrink to 8x 6TB since two of the disks are rusting. I've already dealt with the theory of how to shrink the underlying dmcrypt and ext4 FS, but I'm unsure about the mdmadm --grow command. Do I just say --grow --raid-devices=8? Or should I specify --array-size as well? Should I --fail the drives I want to remove first?

[17:37:53] <lmat> hashworks: One thing that's nice about mdadm is that it is generally hardy. I haven't used it in several years and not much at that, so as always and even more in this case, proceed at your own risk. I would just run the command and use the status/reporting commands to see what's going on. Destroying your array is usually not going to happen without warnings, etc.

[19:47:32] <eoli3n_> in any cases, that's a good test, yes
