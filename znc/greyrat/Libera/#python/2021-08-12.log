[03:12:00] <jarthur> Trio and anyio use a callback style for times when you schedule-but-don't-immediately-await an async function, e.g. tasks.call_soon(some_async_func, arg1, arg2). It helps avoid confusion around whether or not you're actually "running" the function or not when you "call" it.  asyncio has you pass in the realized coroutine object (result of calling some_async_func(arg1, arg2)) which is a prettier syntax but can
[03:12:00] <jarthur>  cause that confusion for new users who don't realize its code isn't immediately being run.

[03:57:49] <sybariten> But then i want to look at taking each gdp value and divide it with the population (from another dict), and sort that. And i think i am succeeding, belgium has the highest followed by chile etc. The problem is that i'm still printing the actual national GDP values, and not the per capita ones
[03:58:50] <sybariten> Which is obvious when running the script. The figures don't decrease in the list, basically. If you understand what i'm after, how can i present the actual figures for gdp per capita , when doing this?

[07:23:07] <dre> does anyone know when using py.test and -s to attach the ipdb.sset_trace() function
[07:23:20] <dre> is there a way i can remove the -s and NOT raise a OSError
[07:24:29] <dre> if i just have the script with ipdb.sset_trace() - it will raise an error unless I have -s, which will put me in the ipdb shell. I just want to skip over it for one run without having to changethe code each time
[07:24:36] <dale> You could maybe try something semi-nuts like opening /dev/tty on stdin/out/err yourself before calling ipdb.
[07:24:50] *** Joins: jmcantrell (~weechat@user/jmcantrell)
[07:25:29] <dale> dre: Oh, that's different.  Try: if os.isatty(0): ipdb.set_trace()
[07:25:56] <dale> dre: My theory is that os.isatty(0) will return True only when you provide -s to pytest.
[07:26:08] <dre> oh interesting
[07:26:14] <dale> If that doesn't work, try os.isatty(1) instead.
[07:26:41] <dale> Hm, actually, pytest might be touching up sys.stdin/stdout/stderr instead, and leaving the FDs alone.  I guess I'm not sure how it works.

[13:23:24] <susam> sveinse: Not without jumping through a lot of hoops. See https://stackoverflow.com/a/42497694/303363 for example. I think you would be much better of making a regular string with format control in it and formatting it later with .format() later.
[13:23:46] <Payam> I package the application. then I install it. and when running it I get an error about the syntaxt
[13:23:55] <Yhg1s> Payam: yes. _what are you running_?
[13:23:59] <Yhg1s> Payam: what is the actual command you type?
[13:24:12] <Payam> mypackage
[13:24:15] <hexnewbie> sveinse: It's somewhat odd, but I've been using this for lazy values: https://bpa.st/J66A (be warned that the belated evaluation *will* change the value) - in this case, I think it's an overkill and too odd, refactoring and putting the f-string inside the if would make more sense.
[13:25:06] <Yhg1s> Payam: what does 'which mypackage' say?
[13:25:42] <sazawal> Yhg1s, Yes it is very basic, that is why I prefer it. I am new to Twisted and TCP communications.
[13:25:58] <sveinse> Yeah, I don't need to go over hoops to insistently use f-strings. I was only wondering. str.format() work well
[13:26:15] <Yhg1s> sazawal: if you don't know about defer or tasks, it's going to be hard to do anything _but_ very basic things. But as I said, the very basic switch is to use the TLS-specific reactor methods.

[14:59:20] <deniska> X4: `'side' and 'qty' and 'symbol' and 'price' and 'leverage'` evaluates to 'leverage' because `and` evaluates either to the first value if it's falsy, or to the second value if it's truthy, and non-empty strings are truthy

[15:00:02] <bjs> X4: also just saying `ValueError("value is empty")` doesn't raise an exception, you actually need to `raise` an error

[15:09:19] <bjs> it's there, but it's None ?
[15:09:37] <grawity> checking for empty or None makes sense, though there's no 'undefined' in python (you get an exception if trying to access a nonexistent key instead)
[15:09:57] <Repiphany> Why not a function with positional and keyword arguments
[15:09:57] <bjs> X4: "given" and "set" aren't Python terms,  what do you mean when you say them

[17:32:50] <very_sneaky> hmm, in terms of channel pop it seems like there's ~600 fewer people - i assume idlers
[17:33:10] <InPhase> very_sneaky: I haven't quantitatively assessed the activity, but it feels like the same volume of active chatter.
[17:33:14] <Yhg1s> very_sneaky: no, there were 1100 or so users around this time of day before freenode's troubles began.
[17:33:16] <very_sneaky> but idk, i've mostly been lurking and it doesn't seem like i see the same chat walls i used to. lots of part/join blocks
[17:33:55] <very_sneaky> Yhg1s: hmm. i seem to remember seeing it at 1700-1800 whenever i looked. admittedly ad hoc samples
[17:34:01] <Lando-SpaceIzzle> lol you don't hide parts/joins in this mega-channel?
[17:34:04] <Yhg1s> that was quite a while ago.
[17:34:19] <kosh> the channel is very bursty, depending on the time of day, time of year and day of the week you get lots of conversations or very little
[17:34:34] <kosh> right now it is summer and many are on vacation
[17:34:59] <very_sneaky> yeah, don't get me wrong, hwenever i have a question someone is always here to discuss - just seemed a little quieter than it used to be
[17:35:00] <InPhase> Yeah, August is traditionally the slowest IRC month.
[17:35:02] <very_sneaky> true

[17:37:33] <Yhg1s> very_sneaky: we get the same kinds of questions.

[17:38:00] <InPhase> very_sneaky: Slack/Discord used to be described as proprietary IRC with pictures.  Now we describe IRC as open source Slack/Discord without pictures.  Times shifted a little.

[17:43:36] <very_sneaky> sure, in the same way that i could also call conan a python package manager
[17:43:48] <Yhg1s> It is indeed quite off-topic.
[17:44:22] <BtbN> The major difference is, setuptools/setup.py/pip is basically a native feature of Python itself. While C++ has nothing like that.
[17:44:47] <Armen> wasn't pip originally a module that had to be installed separately

[17:45:35] <very_sneaky> the reason it's "native" (ish) is because python has a centralised body that drives forward development - it's not an ISO langauge to my knowledge like c++ is. C++ relies on third parties to implement it's compilers

[19:04:37] <sybariten> stealth_: yeah yeah, absolutely. This is for a school exercise. We were given data in this way, some values for a big amount of countries were listed in one dict, and then some basic characteristic data for those countries were kept in another. I agree it looks a bit like how you'd do with a RDBMS, i dunno why they chose to present the data like that.

[19:06:36] <sybariten> zware: well in reality my data looks a little bit different althouygh similar, but i _think_ that the best way for me to solve it is to just build up new dicts and then work on those.

[19:48:23] <stealth_> sybariten, `for key, value in countries.items():` you are most likely missing the `.items()` part
[19:48:41] <sybariten> cause keys are just one value...          grawity , i did for country,number in gdp_per_capita1: print(country)

[19:49:10] <stealth_> sybariten, `gdp_per_capita1.items():`
[19:49:34] <grawity> right, so you're not looping over [("kenya", 1807), ("russia", 11805), ...] -- you're actually looping over ["kenya", "russia", ...]
[19:49:50] <grawity> if you just iterate over a dict, it's the same as using .keys()
[19:50:04] <sybariten> is that _fewer_ values (just one (the country)) than what python expects (two)
[19:50:04] <grawity> so your first iteration actually does: key, value = "kenya"

[19:50:50] <sybariten> it splits it to chars, somewhere?
[19:50:52] <grawity> yes
[19:51:00] <sybariten> well that explains it.  :)  thanks
[19:51:30] <grawity> e.g. a,b,c = "xyz" gives the same result as a,b,c = ["x", "y", "z"]
[19:51:40] <sybariten> damn i wouldnt have thought of that, haha
[19:51:44] <grawity> raub: the actual list object is passed
[19:51:57] <stealth_> raub, the list is passed to the function, you can "update" that list and the list outside value is updated as well.
[19:52:12] <stealth_> outside function is updated as well*
[19:52:48] <raub> grawity: That explains it. So I need to create a list inside function to return a diff/massaged list
[19:52:50] <grawity> if you want a copy, you have to explicitly make a copy and pass that, e.g. myfunc(list(mylist)) or myfunc([*mylist]) or myfunc(copy.copy(mylist)) -- not 100% sure which is preferred generally
[19:52:58] <grawity> or yes, make a copy inside the function
[19:53:10] <stealth_> raub, make sure not to do `def my_function(one=[])` thats a gotcha
[19:53:21] <grawity> in general python is "pass by object"
[19:54:30] <ouzel8_> I am interested in printing each element of a array on a single line separated by tabs. using a foreach loop, and the print function prints each on a new line.
[19:54:38] <ouzel8_> Any ideas?
[19:54:51] <raub> Which option is "the proper way"?
[19:55:10] <grawity> ouzel8_: you could use print(..., end="") to avoid the newline, or even end="\t"

[19:56:41] <grawity> I'm not sure if there's a single "the proper way"
[19:57:07] <SnoopJ> raub, you would want deepcopy() where a shallow copy wouldn't suffice. There isn't enough information in your question to know whether you do or don't need that.
[19:57:26] <raub> stealth_: I think this is a list of dicts
[19:57:57] <grawity> hm yeah, if you want a deep copy, then deepcopy() is the only one that does it
[19:58:04] <grawity> depends on whether you're actually altering those dicts themselves
[19:58:11] <grawity> or only shuffling the parent list
[19:58:28] <ouzel8_> grawity thank you!
[19:58:45] <stealth_> raub, think of it like so `List[reference_to_dict1, reference_to_dict2, ...]` even if make a copy, the reference still stay the same.
[19:59:07] <grawity> ouzel8_: hm though I think the most common method would be to print "\t".join(the_array)

[22:27:42] <deniska> fdee: it can't make n point to another object, but it can mutate object n

[22:28:54] <bjs> fdee: Python variables aren't like C variables. in Python a variable is just a "tag" for a particular object in memory.  f(n) simply looks up the object with the tag "n" and gives a reference to it (if you want to think in those terms) to f.

[22:29:49] <SnoopJ> very helpful read on how names work: https://nedbatchelder.com/text/names1.html
[22:30:14] <fdee> oh I see that primitives are immutable in python. very interesting
[22:30:25] <SnoopJ> that isn't correct, or related
[22:30:49] <bjs> fdee: Python doesn't really have "primitives", and the type of the object doesn't affect how it's passed to a function at all
[22:31:25] <SnoopJ> and in the same way, it doesn't really have "variables" in the sense that other languages that have declarations do. In Python, there are objects, and names that refer to objects. When you do `somename = ...` you're assigning whatever value is on the right-hand side to the given name.
[22:32:01] <SnoopJ> and when you call f(somename), you're calling f with the object associated with that name as the argument

[22:46:52] <dale> bjs: Clever!  My personal taste is not in favor of that generator expression, but chain.from_iterable with zip is wise.
[22:47:10] <SnoopJ> chain is great
[22:48:10] <dale> I'm still stuck in Python 2 thinking that zip is not lazy, bad dale.
