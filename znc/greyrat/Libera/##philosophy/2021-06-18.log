[20:08:01] <raincomplex> sebbu, in the context of the story, i think the main theme is dogmatism versus creativity
[20:08:51] <raincomplex> if you get really caught up in the way things "should be" or how "most people" would solve something, it makes it harder to come up with new ideas
[20:09:59] <raincomplex> and i think very related is the idea of deeper understanding
[20:10:40] <raincomplex> someone who only knows "here's how we deal with ocd" is going to come up with different solutions than someone who has a deeper understanding of what causes ocd, and how it works in the mind
[20:11:37] <raincomplex> regardless of how accurate the "general" understanding of ocd is. i'm talking about understanding within individuals
