[00:13:58] <Gamara> he so I keep getting the error on my websocket server https://pastebin.com/beTpud55 `Session ini settings cannot be changed after headers have already been sent` I have read through a lot of guides and nothing seems to be working
[00:15:20] <Gamara> so I keep getting null when trying to read session data on my server
[00:15:37] <Gamara> I am accessing my server from the same port and domain as well (using proxypass in nginx)
[00:18:27] <ramblebamble> Gamara, I don't know ratchet, but that error is thrown when you started putting content out to the client, and then try to change/add headers in hindsight
[00:18:50] <Gamara> I regret using ratchet honestly lol
[00:19:15] <Gamara> how do I prevent that from happening?
[00:19:17] <ramblebamble> may I ask how you use it, in the context of apache?
[00:19:19] <biberu> why are headers being sent by your session handler? are you using '?>'?
[00:19:56] <ramblebamble> Gamara, simple, do not change/add headers once you have put content on the wire
[00:19:56] <dag> the session settings include stuff like cookie domain etc. so it's a logic error to modify these after content is sent to client.

[00:20:39] <AllenJB> How are you executing server.php?
[00:20:40] <Gamara> I dont know what to do to prevent if from trying to modify the headers
[00:20:51] <Gamara> I have a php-cli docker container

[00:21:02] <dag> learn the language before you start messing with libraries
[00:21:25] <dag> i also mean the php runtime and stdlib
[00:22:14] <Gamara> well yeah I am no expert on php
[00:22:24] <Gamara> but the only way to learn is by doing
[00:22:35] <AllenJB> The message is weird - I wouldn't expect to see it when running as a cli script. However the only obvious output I can see is the `echo` on line 99 of the pastebin. Have you tried commenting that out?
[00:23:09] <Gamara> ok I will try
[00:23:42] <Gamara> I dont know what you mean by learn the language, like read alll the documentation
[00:24:35] <Gamara> honestly if I were to start over I would pick a framework to work in but this is my first project with php
[00:24:52] <Gamara> of course its going to be a pile of poop
[00:25:15] <Gamara> yeah removing the echo statement didnt work
[00:25:53] <Gamara> I could have solved this problem with long poling I suppose but I wanted to use websockets
[00:26:10] <Gamara> which isnt well supported in stdlib
[00:27:14] <Gamara> sucks I got so close to making this work
[00:27:24] <Gamara> guess I should just give up on establishing a session
[00:27:44] <Gamara> doing this for a hackathon in an attempt to get a job
[00:28:30] <Gamara> maybe I should edit my php.ini
[00:28:51] <Gamara> anyone know a good guide for noobs when it comes to php.ini
[00:28:55] <dag> this is easy to debug. what is the html output
[00:29:10] <dag> whats the first characters
[00:29:53] <dag> do you have ?> at the end of your php files?
[00:30:42] <Gamara> no I dont have ?>
[00:31:19] <Gamara> I just realized I have echo on 28
[00:31:27] <Gamara> ending my files
[00:32:12] <Gamara> html output is in the pastebin, body is just a react div tag
[00:33:02] <Gamara> thanks so much for the help btw
[00:33:07] <Gamara> I really appreciate it
[00:34:40] <dag> cant really tell if there's a \n at the beginning of the output
[00:38:33] <Gamara> what is the best way to look at the raw html to check for characters
[00:38:37] <Gamara> that could be messing things up
[00:39:18] <dag> echo "server listening on 8080\n";
[00:39:18] <dag> $server->run();
[00:39:40] <Gamara> i commented that out
[00:39:59] <dag> the echo line? and restarted?
[00:40:24] <dag> this is a cli app. doesnt make sense to use php's native session
[00:41:33] <Gamara> the $server->run() is the websocket app
[00:43:25] <Gamara> ok I found the echo statement in my database connect class *facepalm*
[00:43:38] <Gamara> now no more error
[00:44:04] <Gamara> thanks so much dag you are awesome
[00:44:23] <dag> np. happy to help

[05:55:35] <jargon> For the life of me, I don't remember how GD is supposed to work for the intended purpose.
[05:56:29] <jargon> ImageMagick is easy, but GD is very vague in its documentation.
[05:57:17] <jargon> I used bitmasking in-order to manipulate pixel data directly.
[06:04:12] <Blondie101010> no one told you not to use ImageMagick
[06:04:44] <Blondie101010> I appreciate that you made an effort to show that code

[06:15:02] *** Joins: yar (~yar@user/yardena)
[06:15:32] <yar> is there just no way to have custom class methods that override the meaning of ==, +, -, etc?
[06:15:54] <__adrian> no
[06:16:10] <jargon> Yes.
[06:16:28] <jargon> NenGame was a engine of mine that used custom definitions of such.
[06:16:56] <jargon> But using eval is frowned upon.
[06:17:50] <yar> if your only solution involves eval that sounds like a pretty hard "no"
[06:18:44] <__adrian> i don't know what you're talking about, and i don't really care to hear - but the answer is no. extensions can modify the behavior of comparison operators (see DateTime, for example), but it's not something that's supported in userland.
[06:18:46] <jargon> I guess it does.
[06:18:58] <jargon> doesn't*
[06:19:12] <jargon> (???)
[06:19:23] <jargon> affirmative*
[06:19:48] <yar> makes sense __adrian thanks
[06:20:12] <jargon> __adrian http://puzzlum.net/showcase/vault/Roe2/builds/Roe%20Builder%20mk11%20TILETEST%20v2.7z What is wrong with my use of bitmasking?
[06:20:43] <__adrian> yar: it's been discussed (you can find old RFCs) but it was never considered usefule enough to outweigh the likely abuse
[06:20:47] <jargon> Includes just the code in question, 3 sample images, and a way to display them.
[06:21:06] <yar> how could it be abused?
[06:21:49] <__adrian> jargon: i'm not going to download/install stuff  :)  a reduced test case or example code is preferable.
[06:21:51] <Blondie101010> imo a single use could be sufficient to qualify :)
[06:21:56] <yar> "here's the think you didn't want to see" is a tall enough order without "download and extract this 7z file" on top of it
[06:22:31] <Blondie101010> to me the main irritant is the 7z format
[06:22:57] <jargon> Yeah, but in this case, Blondie101010 actually requested a test case.
[06:23:02] <__adrian> yar: imagine  $x = new Y() >= new Z(); var_dump($x); // "hippo"
[06:23:18] <jargon> circumstance*
[06:23:31] <__adrian> yes, i'm aware blondie asked for it, but i didn't (and wouldn't encourage it)
[06:23:54] <yar> so it's abusive because it could enable very misleading lines of code?
[06:23:58] <__adrian> yar: or (more likely) indirect modification of something as a side effect
[06:24:30] <__adrian> ...that's a fine way to put it, yes.
[06:25:00] <__adrian> a little understated

[06:47:25] <jargon> But it doesn't work right,
[06:48:54] <__adrian> start with explaining what "doesn't work" means. what do you expect the result to be, here?  https://3v4l.org/4gYCk
[06:50:01] <jargon> It does as designed, but not as I intended.
[06:52:11] <jargon> The act of plotting itself is performed, instead of plotting the pixel as alpha.
[06:52:16] <jargon> I want the latter.
[06:53:19] <jargon> So yes, it is indeed now taking into accoun the mask layer.
[06:53:25] <jargon> account*
[06:54:12] <jargon> however, it is literally applying alpha to the result image, instead of literally assigning alpha within the result image.
[06:54:13] <Blondie101010> jargon:  is the problem that the output is all black?
[06:55:00] <jargon> I can assign the intended transparent anything I want, just not with literal transparency in the result.
[06:55:16] <Blondie101010> be much more to the point
[06:55:26] <Blondie101010> what should the output look like?
[06:55:48] <jargon> But yes, it curently properly takes masking into account.
[06:56:00] <jargon> It just doens't literally assign alpha.
[06:56:04] <Blondie101010> it does?
[06:56:31] <jargon> Affirmative, the code recognizes the silohette.
[06:56:57] <Blondie101010> is that visible in the output?
[06:59:56] <jargon> There is no transparency in the output.
[07:00:42] <jargon> it only plot using literally applied levels of transparency.
[07:01:12] <jargon> The result doesn't inherit the traneparency
[07:01:16] <Blondie101010> show me your output as it possibly doesn't match mine

[07:03:29] <__adrian> jargon: no
[07:03:36] <__adrian> what is the result you expect from that function?
[07:03:47] <__adrian> it produces  2147483647

[07:13:30] <__adrian> maybe convert to hex to see. but first you need to answer what your _expected_ result is.
[07:13:44] <__adrian> you can't do something correctly if you don't know what the correct result is.

[07:15:18] <__adrian> ...
[07:15:38] <jargon> Notice the green doesn't show through.
[07:15:53] <__adrian> why are you ignoring my question?

[07:16:12] <jargon> I am showing you right now.
[07:16:41] <__adrian> you're not answering my question at all. you're very specifically avoiding it. you're talking about completely unrelated things.
[07:16:45] <__adrian> re-read my question.
[07:16:51] <jargon> Why does the a background not display thru the alpha of the png?
[07:18:05] <Blondie101010> you seem to be getting hot
[07:18:21] <jargon> Blondie101010 ad yes there was visible change, it is just that the apparent lack of change was coincidntal.
[07:19:19] <Blondie101010> try starting off with your new image by filling it with transparent white pixels
[07:19:58] <jargon> I made it so the level of alpha can be applied and made the page the images display on spring green, but you can clealy see now what I mean by improper alpha
[07:20:21] <Blondie101010> I see that it has a black background

[14:43:52] <biberu> i don't think that's valid in a sitemap, but if it's not yours and you need to parse it look up how to add a definition for it, no idea if simplexml can do that though
[14:44:03] <sumthing1980> something with  html_entity_decode will do I think

[14:54:25] <AllenJB> As I understand it you're trying to parse an xml document (site map) from a 3rd party (you have no control over the generated document). At the moment that's going to have XML tags (demarked by < and >) and attributes (using " or '),  but the content of those tags / attributes is encoded (< is &lt;, " is &quot;, or their numeric equivalents).
[14:54:26] <AllenJB> If you run html_entiity_decode on the entire document the encoded entities will be decoded, but this will break the document because the XML parser will see tags and attribute (end) where it shouldn't.
[14:56:23] <Naktibalda> sumthing1980: If you were on generating side, you could wrap contents of that tag with <!CDATA ]]> to make it "not-XML"

[15:03:56] <AllenJB> What I think you want to do is load the document either using DomDocument with strict checking ( https://www.php.net/DomDocument#domdocument.props.stricterrorchecking ) disabled, or using this method with SimpleXML: https://www.php.net/manual/en/simplexml.examples-errors.php so you can ignore the errors

[15:58:02] <olle> LOC = lines of code
[15:58:10] <olle> CC cyclomatic complexity

[15:58:35] <olle> More bugs in new code. Not a surprise there. ^^
[15:59:20] <olle> Some interesting results: CC is not a good measurement to figure out buggy code, for example.
[15:59:36] <sumthing1980> okidoki
[15:59:49] <olle> LOC is a good measure meant BEFORE a software is released.

[18:04:22] <AllenJB> Not familiar with dpkg output, but It appears you may have multiple versions of PHP installed / active. Are you modifying configuration for the correct one? Check the output of phpinfo() (from a web request) - it will tell you the location of the ini files that are being used.in the top table.
[18:04:23] <AllenJB> (You may also withy to confirm what version of PHP is being used)
[18:04:43] <Change> Im trying to generate a mod_rewrite rule to change domain.com/index.php?site=home in domain.com/home. Do i have to create a seperate rule for every possible "site"-parameter or is it possible to create a rewrite template so every parameter is changed to the /parameter?
[18:05:26] <AllenJB> How does a2enmod behave / work with multiple PHP versions? (You may wish to ask your distros support channel - a2enmod is distro specific and is not shipped by PHP itself)
[18:06:16] <s17> Change: yes, it is possible
[18:07:17] <Change> @s17: do you know a good guide for that?
[18:07:29] <AllenJB> Change: They are regular expressions, so you can write a single rewrite rule for multiple URLs. You may also wish to investigate FallbackResource, which redirects all requests that don't match anything else to the specified file (index.php) - then you handle routing within that.
[18:07:44] <s17> yes, Regular Expressions
[18:08:08] <s17> maybe check Apache.org for a guide on how to use mod_rewrite
[18:08:32] <AllenJB> http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/rewrite/
[18:09:03] <Change> ty, i hate regex, my brain just dont want to understand the logic behind ;D
[18:12:40] <yang> Additional .ini files parsed -> /etc/php/7.0/apache2/conf.d/20-mysqli.ini
[18:13:18] <AllenJB> I recommend putting the effort in to learn it - regex is a super power. It's used across languages and by a variety of tools.

[21:36:34] <__adrian> it's a valid warning. two things to do, here: (1) why are you using auth=plain? strongly recommend you don't. (2) if you want to handle imap errors manually (rather than having php trigger them), look at https://php.net/imap_errors and https://php.net/imap_alerts
[21:37:14] <rveerman> i don't want to expose dovecot to the outside world; it's got a lot of zero-day vulnerabilities.
[21:37:27] <rveerman> so i'm using my own pretty webmail PHP routines to access it.

[21:38:08] <rveerman> but that requires that i don't use SSL, because SSL would have to be bound to a domain name, and then i have to forward&open the port on my internet modem
[21:39:08] <rveerman> i just want imap_open() to succeed on port 143 using plaintext auth
[21:39:23] <rveerman> and ignore any warnings
[21:39:51] <__adrian> it's your decision, of course. but i'm definitely not going to recommend any of it or agree it's a good idea.
[21:40:22] <rveerman> given how many holes dovecot exposes, it's a very good idea :)
[21:40:32] <rveerman> can you help me get it to work?
[21:40:49] <__adrian> ...did you read the second part of the answer?
[21:41:20] <rveerman> anyone else, please?

[22:08:15] <Blondie101010> rveerman:  email uses a domain name, so I'm very unsure why you bring such a point...  also note that self-signed certs still allow encryption, though they don't validate the hostname which seems irrelevant in your case anyways

[22:16:58] <AllenJB> You can generate LetsEncrypt TLS certs using DNS verification without exposing any services.
[22:18:14] <AllenJB> (Aside: I question the assertion that Dovecot / a correctly configured Dovecot server has many unfixed ("0-day") vulnerabilities given how well maintained it is and how widely it's used)
[22:19:02] <Blondie101010> I agree but it's obviously pointless to mention in the situation
[22:24:14] <rveerman> https://www.cybersecurity-help.cz/vdb/list.php?search_line=Y&filter%5B%25SEARCH%5D=dovecot
[22:24:26] <rveerman> 6 pages worth of recent exploits
[22:24:41] <rveerman> most will be unpatched by ubuntu (which is my OS)
[22:25:33] <rveerman> it's one thing to expose my SMTP server, but i really dont want to expose my IMAP server as well
[22:26:53] <Blondie101010> your choice, but lowering your security does not protect you more
[22:26:57] <__adrian> you might have misread - i'm not suggesting that you need to expose dovecot at all. i'm suggesting you use ssl. as described above, it's easy and cheap and why on earth wouldn't you?
[22:27:20] <rveerman> because the port isn't accessible from the outside world, that's why
[22:27:28] <__adrian> there are plenty of other things i don't like about what you're describing, but focusing on the specific question here
[22:27:30] <Blondie101010> that does not matter
[22:27:50] <__adrian> and also, really think maybe you missed the second part of my original answer
[22:28:05] <Blondie101010> yeah as it addresses the problem directly
[22:28:15] <__adrian> s/problem/question/
[22:28:17] <__adrian> but yes
[22:30:15] <rveerman> does using imap_errors() allow me to ignore the errors? because i'm also getting a refusal of both courier-imap and dovecot to login using plaintext authentication when using telnet
[22:30:24] <rveerman> so ehm, i'm really stuck
[22:30:26] <__adrian> i linked the manual pages.
[22:30:54] <rveerman> yeah, but as i'm getting a refusal to log in using telnet, i don't think imap_errors() is going to cut it
[22:31:00] <__adrian> it allows you to handle them however you want, rather than leaving them for php to deal with.
[22:31:18] <__adrian> if you have the problem _without_ php, then yes, your problem is not about php
[22:31:43] <rveerman> yeah.. i'll keep looking..
[22:31:47] <rveerman> thx for the help, folks
