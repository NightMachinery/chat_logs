[02:47:14] <Fenderbassist> he had done something to it to keep it running
[02:47:20] <Fenderbassist> like a Frankenstein
[02:47:21] <KatrinValerie> Good lord
[02:47:29] <Fenderbassist> yeah it had like 260k miles

[02:47:43] <KatrinValerie> Though it did not require a full rebuild yet
[02:47:43] <Fenderbassist> the thing rattled when it ran lol
[02:47:55] <Fenderbassist> it had been in 3 car accidents before he got it
[02:48:01] <KatrinValerie> and well, two strokes die hard
[02:48:08] <Fenderbassist> ah
[02:48:22] <KatrinValerie> there's not much on this car that can break, if you keep up the maintainence
[02:48:32] <Fenderbassist> is what I do

[03:27:25] <Nanobot> I'm remembering a scene from a TV show or movie, but I can't remember what show/movie it was. Not anime; I believe it was live action and English-language. The scene: A bunch of people were treating one guy as a god, worshipping him and hanging on his every word. He was trying to convince them that he was a normal person. He said something like, "I'm just a guy. My name is ________." (I don't remember the name). The other guys just sorta looked at each 
[03:27:25] <Nanobot> other for a moment, and then one was like, "His name is ________." And then, they all began chanting, "His name is ________!" as if it was some new doctrine passed down from the gods.
[03:27:53] <Nanobot> It might have been a Star Trek TNG episode (it had a few episodes where a scene like that could have happened), but I can't remember.
[03:28:21] <Fenderbassist> oh there was an old English movie like that I think, I need to remember what it was or where I saw it referred to
[03:29:29] <Nanobot> Maybe Life of Brian?
[03:29:41] <Fenderbassist> no not that one, was set in the 1970s I think

[07:21:56] <amigojapan> Hi MootPoot I was reading you message you left me
[07:22:32] <amigojapan> MootPoot: isn't the Pico low spec like an Arduino?
[07:23:12] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I am confused why you would want to run a UNIX clone in it
[07:27:10] <Sadale> nya~ :3
[07:27:56] <Sadale> MootPoot, nice. Didn't know that such a unix existed
[07:27:59] <MootPoot> amigojapan: yes and no
[07:28:03] <MootPoot> and why not
[07:28:23] <Sadale> MootPoot, Now that I'm wondering if I could port it to other microcontrollers, like STM32 or ESP32
[07:28:29] <MootPoot> the pico has a dual core ARM cortex M0 
[07:28:39] <MootPoot> its wayyyyyyy more powerful then the arduino amigojapan 
[07:28:46] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I think most of the resources would be used up by the OS
[07:28:51] <MootPoot> but its not as powerful  as a full raspberr pi
[07:29:02] <amigojapan> I see
[07:29:12] <MootPoot> !g atmega 128 specs
[07:29:14] <ImoutoBot> MootPoot: ATmega128/L Datasheet Summary - Microchip Technology <http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/devicedoc/2467s.pdf> | ATmega128 | Microchip Technology <https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/ATMEGA128> | ATmega128 64-Pin 16MHz 128kb 8-bit Microcontroller ... <https://www.futurlec.com/Atmel/ATMEGA128.shtml>
[07:29:26] <MootPoot> yeah 16 MHz
[07:29:36] <MootPoot> the chip on the pico is 133MHz
[07:29:39] <MootPoot> and dual core
[07:29:53] <MootPoot> with double the SRAM as well
[07:29:58] <Sadale> MootPoot, actually, pretty much any el cheapo microcontroller would be offering far better performance than Arduino Uno for the same price.
[07:30:02] *** Quits: Sxem (~sxem@pool-108-31-231-10.washdc.fios.verizon.net) (Quit: Leaving)
[07:30:15] <Sadale> MootPoot, Arduino is very overpriced. And the microcontroller powering it is just weak for its price.
[07:30:20] <MootPoot> are you talking about the full arduino price
[07:30:26] <amigojapan> Double the SRAM? 4k?
[07:30:26] <MootPoot> or the chinese copy ones
[07:30:39] <MootPoot> amigojapan: uni has 129kb, pico has 264kb
[07:30:46] <Sadale> MootPoot, Even more so for full Arduino price. But even at Chinese Arduino clone price, it's still rather expensive for its capability
[07:31:06] <MootPoot> amigojapan: my bad, its even more, the pico has 264KB
[07:31:06] <amigojapan> MootPoot: you can get a 328p processor for about 1 dollar
[07:31:20] <ButterNoodle> whats that
[07:31:34] <MootPoot> the main deal is just that arduino has the nice IDE and lots of inputs afaik
[07:31:47] <Sadale> MootPoot, For example, nodeMCU ESP32 edition is as expensive as Arduino clone. And it's far more powerful than Arduino clone.
[07:32:01] <MootPoot> wifi too!
[07:32:04] <Sadale> Dual core. More perhipherals. Has built-in wifi and bluetooth capability.
[07:32:19] <Sadale> And you could even run most of the Arduino code with it. :3
[07:32:22] <MootPoot> the esp32 is dual core?
[07:32:23] <MootPoot> huh
[07:32:26] <MootPoot> I thought it was a single
[07:32:34] <amigojapan> MootPoot: you are talking about another Arduino than what I am used to
[07:32:52] <Sadale> I think so. They've dual core and single core variants. But I think one of the cores is dedicated for wifi or bluetooth or something.
[07:32:59] <amigojapan> The newer ones
[07:33:55] <Sadale> That being said, Arduino does have its perks. It's ubiquitous.

[07:35:19] <Sadale> MootPoot, let me check
[07:35:34] <Sadale> MootPoot, AFAIK there're real chip and clone chip for ATMega328p

[07:35:50] <MootPoot> lol really
[07:35:54] <MootPoot> it has a clone

[07:40:39] <Sadale> MootPoot, so if you go for the real 328p chip, yes. It's very much overpriced. At that price point there're plenty of alternatives, including ESP32, STM32F0/F1, etc. etc.
[07:40:58] <Sadale> And the alternatives are far better in terms of hardware capabilities at that price point.
[07:41:45] <Sadale> MootPoot, Now that I'm wondering what FUZIX is capable of

[07:45:01] <MootPoot> Sadale: I have 6 picos
[07:45:15] <MootPoot> was thinking of setting it up but I dont think I have a microsd like that
[07:45:18] <Sadale> MootPoot, any idea on if FUZIX supports running a compiler inside? or like running python inside there.

[07:45:20] <amigojapan> I had Thai food last night

[07:45:33] <MootPoot> uh
[07:45:41] <MootPoot> I have headers
[07:45:55] <MootPoot> that I soldered onto the pi
[07:45:56] <Sadale> MootPoot, you could solder a male header pin to a SD-microSD adapter for that. I've done that before.

[07:47:06] <Sadale> ouch
[07:47:16] <MootPoot> they refunded me tho s
[07:47:17] <MootPoot> o
[07:47:24] <MootPoot> not a problem
[07:47:37] <Sadale> Anyway if you solder wires or male pin header onto the microSD-SD adapter directly, it may not be sturdy. It really depends on your soldering skill.
[07:48:14] <Sadale> With the male headers tho you could just plug your microSD card adapter onto the breadboard, and you can plug the microSD card onto your adapter.

[08:19:36] <MootPoot> Sadale: if I could find a way to get wifi on the pico..now that would be someting
[08:19:36] <Sadale> Urchin[emacs], cute :3
[08:19:40] <JesseDesu> it looks odd
[08:19:49] <Sadale> MootPoot, why don't you just get esp8266 then? :P
[08:19:50] <MootPoot> upside down is good for 69
[08:20:09] <JesseDesu> sometimes upside down looks ok until you flip it around and realize it looks off
[08:20:33] <JesseDesu> its a common optical illusion
[08:20:39] <ButterNoodle> u know.. when u drop in a channel with a real question u get 3 types of responses
[08:21:16] <JesseDesu> a right answer a wrong answer and a non sequitor
[08:21:24] <Sadale> MootPoot, or you could use ESP8266 as a wifi modem for the pico. But I don't really see the point of using pico then because esp8266 would do the job unless you need that many perhipherals
[08:21:31] <ButterNoodle> the arch response - I know the answer already, did u read the forums, how tos, wiki, and google before darkening our doorstep with ur shit question
[08:21:44] <Sadale> BTW, I'm using esp8266 for my clock :3
[08:21:50] <MootPoot> I heard there was a updated version to the esp32
[08:21:55] <MootPoot> 8266*
[08:21:59] <Sadale> oh. really?
[08:22:16] <Sadale> Did you mean ESP32-C3? It can be used for replacing ESP8266. The pinout is the same.
[08:22:25] <MootPoot> esp yeah that's the one
[08:22:28] <Sadale> at least the pinout of its module is the same as ESP8266.
[08:22:29] <MootPoot> with bluetooth as well
[08:22:32] <Sadale> yep
[08:22:34] <ButterNoodle> the python response - why would you ever do it that way.. it makes no sense. *which translates to roughly "I barely know this stuff myself, and can only guess what ur talking about so I am gonna shit on you so I get channel clout"

[09:47:01] <JesseDesu> i should be riding a cbr250, something i can actually pick off the ground in case i drop it
[09:47:11] <JesseDesu> but i'm spoiled
[09:47:13] <ButterNoodle> I can literally operate the ktm clutch with one finger
[09:47:25] <MootPoot> can u make it cum with 1 finger
[09:47:29] <ButterNoodle> yea
[09:47:34] <HubertFarnsworth> lol MootPoot 
[09:47:43] <ButterNoodle> cant u?
[09:47:45] <HubertFarnsworth> ButterNoodle: that's a pretty smooth cluth
[09:47:57] <HubertFarnsworth> clutch*
[09:47:59] <JesseDesu> my clutch cable is 4 or 5 years old on the cbr
[09:48:03] <MootPoot> rever been on a euro bike
[09:48:05] <JesseDesu> still hasnt frayed
[09:48:12] <MootPoot> never*
[09:48:16] <ButterNoodle> its also has quick shift.. so I only need clutch on downshift anyway
[09:48:19] <JesseDesu> motion pro cable
[09:48:35] <MootPoot> tiem for some more jahy same
[09:48:42] * MootPoot puts on crocs and a t shirt
[09:48:45] <HubertFarnsworth> I have a normal bike here
[09:48:49] <ButterNoodle> I put a motion pro on my cr500 and that lightened it up.. was still the hardest clutch to pull
[09:48:52] <HubertFarnsworth> you know, just a bike
[09:48:54] <MootPoot> I want a 1000cc scooter
[09:48:56] <HubertFarnsworth> no fancy shit
[09:48:58] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: pics
[09:49:12] <MootPoot> JesseDesu: do u like adv bikes
[09:49:23] <JesseDesu> butter i saw a 2 front wheeled motorcycle recently
[09:49:28] <MootPoot> niken?
[09:49:28] <JesseDesu> looks like a piaggio mp3
[09:49:33] <ButterNoodle> I hate those
[09:49:46] <JesseDesu> i was trying to see what brand it was
[09:50:09] <ButterNoodle> probably can-am
[09:50:11] <JesseDesu> mootpoot
[09:50:13] <JesseDesu> tiger 900
[09:50:41] <ButterNoodle> the 1200 speed triple seems ok
[09:50:51] <MootPoot> but its a triumph
[09:50:55] <ButterNoodle> tru
[09:50:58] <MootPoot> I'm spoiled
[09:51:03] <ButterNoodle> not enough cock for me
[09:51:04] <MootPoot> I dont trust western makers
[09:51:06] <JesseDesu> ducati might be a good one too but its too fancy for actual dirt
[09:51:22] <ButterNoodle> new v4 multistrada
[09:51:34] <ButterNoodle> not as torque'y
[09:51:38] <ButterNoodle> but more top end
[09:51:51] <ButterNoodle> I was looking at those when I bought the concours
[09:51:52] <JesseDesu> i mean, the ultimate dual sport is arguably a KLR650
[09:51:55] <JesseDesu> its a thumper tho
[09:51:57] <JesseDesu> single
[09:52:01] <ButterNoodle> man
[09:52:06] <ButterNoodle> xr650l
[09:52:11] <ButterNoodle> good ole shit stick
[09:52:14] <MootPoot> somebody go make a time machine and get me one of those 4 cylinder 250cc bikes from the 80s
[09:52:20] <ButterNoodle> ?
[09:52:27] <MootPoot> hairdryer RPM
[09:52:29] <ButterNoodle> still make a cbr250rr
[09:52:38] <ButterNoodle> not in merica tho
[09:52:39] <JesseDesu> japan has a CBR400, its rare in the states
[09:52:42] <JesseDesu> have to import it
[09:52:44] <ButterNoodle> yea that
[09:52:50] <ButterNoodle> didnt they have it in 250?
[09:52:52] <JesseDesu> inline 4

[12:18:25] <Sadale> > <MootPoot> Sadale: would there be any reason why I would need EEPROM or those quarts oscillators for arduino / rpi pico
[12:19:04] <listen_ers> nice
[12:19:50] <Sadale> MootPoot, I'm not sure on rpi pico. For Arduino, There's actually an internal oscillator inside the microcontroller. However, using exteranl quarts oscillator on the Arduino Uno board is more precise than the internal oscillator. You may need that for UART if whatever UART device you're connecting to have a tight tolerance.
[12:22:25] <Sadale> MootPoot, As for EEPROM, I don't think it's of much use. Technically, the benefit of EEPROM over flash is that it has higher number write cycles, and you can modify individual bits. However, you could just allocate a bit of flash memory and just write code for wear-leveling. Of course that'd be more code than just using EEPROM.
[12:23:03] <Sadale> MootPoot, Or you could just store your files on a microSD card if you can connect it to your microcontroller. Then EEPROM may not even be of use anymore.
[12:29:39] <JesseDesu> cum
[12:29:50] <JesseDesu> sadale :3
[12:30:29] <Sadale> JesseDesu, nya~? :3
[12:31:36] <HeTo> you can write individual bits to 0 on EEPROM, but to write a bit from 0 to 1 you need to erase the whole block

[12:37:35] <MootPoot> so for most things it isent worth it
[12:37:42] <MootPoot> is it worth picking up a few IC's just in case?
[12:37:48] <MootPoot> I'm making a order from aliexpress anyway
[12:38:12] <Sadale> MootPoot, what kind of ICs you're talking about?
[12:38:20] <MootPoot> btw is the SYB-500 breadboard good value -  I thought it was but then I looked carefully, seems to be just 4 normal 1 dollar  boards stuck together for 15 dollars price
[12:38:26] <MootPoot> Sadale: EEPROM ICs
[12:38:38] <Sadale> MootPoot, oh you're talking about external EEPROM.
[12:39:11] <Sadale> MootPoot, Anyway I wouldn't recommend speculatively getting ICs. Chances are that you wouldn't find what you need when you start a project and you'd have to look for the ICs that you don't have. Get a project in your mind first, then buy the ICs required for that.
[12:39:20] <MootPoot> Oh, ok
[12:39:22] <Sadale> MootPoot, To me I've never used external EEPROM in any of my projects.
[12:40:16] <ImoutoBot> New episode for: Boruto: Naruto Next Generations | Episode: 228
[12:40:44] <MootPoot> What about the syb500
[12:42:20] <Sadale> What's that?
[12:42:26] <Sadale> oh breadboard. Why not?
[12:42:38] <MootPoot> Well I'm not sure if it's worth the money
[12:42:42] <MootPoot> This model specifically
[12:42:52] <MootPoot> It's like 4 boards stuck together 
[12:42:55] <Sadale> It doesn't have to be syb500. Just pick whatever cheap breadboard. You could even get multiple ones.
[12:43:05] <MootPoot> I already have 2 but I need more 
[12:43:07] <MootPoot> Larger one 
[12:43:09] <MootPoot> More room
[12:43:20] <Sadale> There're something that's always useful for prototyping, including breadboard, resistors kit, capacitors kit, some LEDs, etc.
[12:43:54] <Sadale> What kind of project you're working on? If there're so many breadboards you may wish to start designing your own PCB as well. The wires can get messy
[12:44:48] <Sadale> MootPoot, you probably know that. You could get multiple breadboards of the same model and snap them into one. Most breadboards can be snapped together.
[12:45:17] <MootPoot> I'm just trying to work out cost effectiveness
[12:45:29] <MootPoot> 15 dollars for a syb 500
[12:45:35] <MootPoot> Or buy a bunch of smaller ones
[12:46:14] <Sadale> huh? Is aliexpress that expensive?
[12:46:24] <MootPoot> It's just this one 
[12:46:28] <MootPoot> The syb 500
[12:47:20] <Sadale> syb500 is apparently just 4 full-size breadboards snapped into one. On taobao, a fullsize breadboard only costs $1.
[12:47:34] <MootPoot> Yeah that's what I was thinking
[12:47:40] <MootPoot> Why is it so expensive
[12:47:41] <Sadale> So four fullsize breadboards would be only $4 to me. aliexpress may be a bit more expensive tho
[12:48:03] <MootPoot> Funny thing, Amazon is actually the same price as AliExpress if you buy in bulk
[12:48:15] <MootPoot> So above 10-15 dollars worth of parts 
[12:48:20] <Sadale> I'd recommend getting the cheaper option. Maybe get a few pieces of spares. :P
[12:48:53] <DunceCotus> spared paireds
[12:49:00] <Sadale> Just because something's more expensive doesn't mean that it's of better quality. In fact, breadboard just breaks over time. They're consumables if you use it too heavily.

[13:02:59] <MootPoot> yeah, I guess
[13:03:06] <MootPoot> just ordered a single esp 32
[13:03:19] <MootPoot> since it was the only think i wanted that was cheaper on aliexpress
[13:03:48] *** Quits: Koobrick (Koobrick@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/koobrick) (Quit: Leaving)
[13:06:15] <Sadale> MootPoot, did you order the chip itself or a development module or a development board? If you're using breadboard, get the development board like nodemcu or something like that.
[13:06:28] <MootPoot> Devboard
[13:06:31] <Sadale> nice :3
[13:06:32] <MootPoot> With headers 
[13:06:39] <Sadale> have fun MootPoot :3
[13:06:57] <MootPoot> I just wanted to say I have a RISC V cpu
[13:06:58] <MootPoot> Lol
[13:07:02] <Sadale> The actual tricky part is to work on the project tho. It's easier to buy shit than to actually work on something xD
[13:07:05] <Sadale> wait
[13:07:21] <Sadale> hmm that's technically correct.
[13:07:54] <MootPoot> Jokes aside I do have a project in mind for it 
[13:08:13] <Sadale> MootPoot, only ESP32-C3 has a powerful RISC V CPU. The classic ESP32 has two cores, and neither of them is RISC V. However, it has a low power core that's RISC V. :3
[13:08:34] <Sadale> I think it's called ULP. So ESP32 has two cores plus a ultra-low-power core.

[15:09:44] <amigojapan> Hi Jesse
[15:11:02] <JesseDesu> hi
[15:11:07] <amigojapan> JesseDesu: I heard of a cloud service where you can get 5tb of cloud forever for 600usd. You never have to pay again
[15:11:40] <JesseDesu> you can buy a 5TB hdd for about $100
[15:11:50] <MootPoot> icedrive
[15:12:05] <amigojapan> Yeah icedrive
[15:12:22] <MootPoot> amigojapan: I got a vaccum sealer
[15:12:57] <amigojapan> JesseDesu: yeah but that's almost the same price for the same thing hosted forever
[15:13:10] <MootPoot> less, actually
[15:13:32] <MootPoot> if you want 5tb for a year from microsoft or mega etc- you're looking at about 100 dollars a year
[15:13:55] <JesseDesu> will it be around in 5 years
[15:14:07] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I was taking about getting a phisical drive
[15:14:08] <JesseDesu> they might get owned by microsoft eventually
[15:14:08] <MootPoot> but then again if you have the time and effort to setup and maintain your own cloud
[15:14:28] <MootPoot> amigojapan: ok
[15:14:39] <MootPoot> JesseDesu: pretty sure icedrive already uses AWS
[15:15:53] <amigojapan> MootPoot: they probably keep their data in their own personal data center, that's probably how they make it so cheap

[17:26:47] <amigojapan> Today is her birthday
[17:27:31] <emmeka> I'm usually not a shounen fan these days, but I like Demon Slayer, because it's legitimately well choreographed and animated in a way only ufotable seems to be able to pull off

[17:30:25] <darkwitch> that's good amigojapan
[17:30:45] <amigojapan> Thanks darkwitch 
[17:30:47] <darkwitch> some people care more about jesus than about their grandmothers
[17:30:59] <JesseDesu> did you fill a bathtub with water and play with your submarine
[17:31:15] <emmeka> JesseDesu you'd probably like where I grew up. It houses the country's air force museum which has a whole huge building and field filled with military planes, and every couple year they host a commonwealth air show there
[17:31:31] <amigojapan> Jesse no .I did not think it would be water proof
[17:31:35] <emmeka> our largest airforce base is there
[17:32:30] <JesseDesu> emmeka i miss being 10 years old
[17:32:36] <JesseDesu> and pretending to be a pilot

[17:37:05] <amigojapan> I need to fix a few links on my web page that GitHub broke. But again I have been lazy
[17:37:38] <emmeka> if I was to do a model plane, it would be an Avro CF-100. They have one at the air force museum. The only fighter jet designed and built in Canada.
[17:37:55] <emmeka> my grandfather used to work on them, as an air force mechanic
[17:38:23] <JesseDesu> the super sabre
[17:39:12] <amigojapan> It's a shame the concord was discontinued
[17:40:05] <JesseDesu> one of my childhood friends became an air force technician
[17:40:16] <JesseDesu> worked on F-15E strike eagles
[17:40:45] <JesseDesu> he quit tho, too much pressure
[17:40:48] <emmeka> my grandfather did because he literally walked from the residential school they stuck him in to the air force base at Goose Bay, and enlisted, as a means to escape
[17:41:58] <JesseDesu> oh and i have one distant relative that flew F-5s in the philippines
[17:42:05] <emmeka> spent his life in the air force in various capacities, he eventually served as a blue beret during the Cypriot civil war

[17:45:21] <JesseDesu> unafraid to put too much glue and paint
[17:45:32] <emmeka> but idk, I have mixed feelings about the air force. I went to high school on base. And that base is where all dead soldiers are flown back to, where they do repatriation ceremonies. Every time dead soldiers came back, they lined us students up like decor for the funeral processions down Hwy 2.

[17:46:36] <JesseDesu> yea thats sad
[17:47:07] <JesseDesu> the planes i like to build are replicas of war machines that have probably killed thousands

[17:47:51] <JesseDesu> :/
[17:48:08] <emmeka> not to mention the whole clusterfuck of Colonel Russell Williams, that shook any faith I had in the military
[17:48:44] <emmeka> it's kind of strange to say that I personally have met and spoken to a serial killer before he was caught, but it is true.

[18:18:28] <Cryowolf> Bco1981, it's useless to tell someone who wants to do drugs that they shouldn't :P

[18:21:52] <Bco1981> if you are lucky... maybe at the end of next year.
[18:21:55] <Cryowolf> saw them at MSRP twice

[18:22:06] <Bco1981> and in stock ?
[18:22:07] <Cryowolf> but I wasnt fast enough
[18:22:08] <Cryowolf> yes
[18:22:43] <Cryowolf> I follow some bots on twitter that announce GPU stocks the moment the stores they watch get them
[18:22:49] <Cryowolf> also on some german site
[18:23:43] <Terminus> i'm highly tempted to grab a gpu now. saw a $250 drop for a 3060 ti. must resist.

[18:25:05] <Cryowolf> as long as my 750w can run em thats fine
[18:25:30] <Cryowolf> I doubt the x60 and x70 can't be run on 750w
[18:25:34] <Bco1981> more then 300Watt is too much. the amount of heat coming from my pc is not really fun.

[18:25:51] <Bco1981> that will die
[18:26:09] <Cryowolf> my psu is in its own air tunnel seperate from the rest
[18:26:21] <Terminus> but yes, the reason why i'm resisting pulling the trigger on a GPU right now is because of the refresh rumor on jan 11. thinking it might be why i saw the $250 price drop.
[18:26:40] <Cryowolf> hmmm
[18:26:50] <Terminus> also, intel arc is interesting me.
[18:26:50] <Cryowolf> I'll wait for that rumor too then unless I see something at msrp or below
[18:27:06] <Cryowolf> intel arc has only shown 1000 series power so far
[18:27:40] <Terminus> lmao the price difference between a 3060 ti and 3060 is only $20
[18:28:33] <Cryowolf> Im aiming for 3060ti 3070 0r 3070ti
[18:28:37] <Cryowolf> or 6800xt
[18:31:03] <Terminus> i'll probably just pull the trigger on something like the 3060 ti too. don't think i'll have $5k to spare any time soon to actually get the setup i really want with ultrawide screens so i don't think i'll need the power of a 3080 ti.

[23:27:50] <ButterNoodle> yea
[23:27:54] <ButterNoodle> they re curved it
[23:28:04] <Bco1981> they changed it ?
[23:28:21] <ButterNoodle> I think they ditched a lot of old stuf that isnt on the leaderboard
[23:28:28] <ButterNoodle> I think ur stats are ok
[23:28:34] <ButterNoodle> mine are fucked
[23:28:54] <ButterNoodle> I went from #6400 something up to 6900

[23:29:54] <Bco1981> yeah i see
[23:30:09] <Bco1981> dropped you about 600
[23:30:30] <ButterNoodle> yea thats fucking lame
[23:30:49] <ButterNoodle> I'll just have to beat off harder I guess
[23:30:57] <Bco1981> but if they ditched a lot of old, then i should have lost a lot.
[23:31:04] <ButterNoodle> thats what they say
[23:31:17] <ButterNoodle> score saber is under new management.. I think they are idiots

[23:41:36] <Cryowolf> Smeef, us Swedes have a different approach entirely. We poop pieces of ice and snow that evaporate and disappear into the atmosphere
