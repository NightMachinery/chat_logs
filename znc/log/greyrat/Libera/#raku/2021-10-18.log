[00:52:32] <eof> i looked into whether treesitter could handle raku for this, and it doesn't seem like it has the capacity to fully support some of the language constructs.
[00:58:26] <MasterDuke> interesting, i'd wondered that
[01:05:13] <eof> as-is, i currently have a string propertizer for emacs that can deal with the entire range of adverbs and quoting constructs (save for heredoc) correctly and I'm currently thinking about how I want to approach heredoc.

[02:14:40] <tbrowder> eof: a proper heredoc handler for emacs would be most welcome!
[02:16:44] <tbrowder> as a hint, reading the Synopsis 2 on heredocs might help you see how Raku parses them
[02:25:24] <eof> I had actually had a working prototype for heredoc built around a previous strategy, but rethought the way things currently work a bit.
[02:26:20] <eof> the strategy described in Syn.2 si optimal; however, the current approach I am using in emacs is still a "dumb" linear analysis that decorates text and moves on. this is primarily for the sake of efficiency. 
[02:27:09] <eof> i think i would ideally store a parse tree and then walk that to decorate text. it would work better; however, assembling a quality tree in emacs would require almost completely implementing and maintaining a raku parser in emacs
[02:29:41] <eof> i have wondered if the best approach is to write some raku that can spit out the parse tree for a file in sexprs and then emacs can work over that. the primary issues I can think of for this approach are that I'm not certain that I can easily get quality parse trees for invalid or incomplete code, and that there is potential for noticeable lag when updating the document - asynchronous execution of the raku code would prevent the interface from freezing, but font faces 
[02:29:41] <eof> would update slower than you could type

[07:00:55] <eof> there are several items that are explained as if they are a uniform self-contained construct but are clearly composed of many discrete lexemes such as the arbitrary base literals, which are presented as `:N<N>` while `:N('N')` will also work.

[07:01:33] <eof> of course, there are things like Perl6/Grammar.nqp

[07:13:29] <guifa> (I'm sure a Raku-renamed version is somewhere, but this grammar has been held to pretty well)
[07:21:27] <eof> i think i can work off this
[07:21:50] <eof> i think i may have run across it at some point
[07:22:23] <eof> regardless, I need to refresh my understanding of some Raku grammar behaviors...

[15:24:59] <ugexe> Xliff: previously CURFS would load a module using a comp-unit-id that could be incorrect because it didn't account for changes in the repository chain. if you are now suddenly precompiling way too often i would guess you are changing the repo chain (adding -I's or `use lib ...`s)
[15:26:22] <Xliff> ugexe: Yes, I am using -I when I need to make changes to upstream modules.
[15:26:40] <Xliff> Which is unfortunately a very common case when developing this app server for $dayJob
[15:26:57] <Xliff> Howver now, symbols are not getting recognized as well.
[15:27:10] <ugexe> you could technically work around it by always passing the same -I's 
[15:27:20] <ugexe> i.e. always try to use the same repo chain
[15:27:28] <Xliff> 'use B::I::Symbol; Symbol.new' <= now generates an error.
[15:28:06] <Xliff> ugexe: The invocation is in a script which is what precompiles and executes. It is always the same -I list in the same order.]
[15:28:34] <ugexe> and the script doesnt use `use lib ...`?
[15:28:39] <Xliff> No
[15:28:49] <ugexe> yeah i dunno then
[15:29:05] <Xliff> Yeah. Figured that. New behavior over the last week.
[15:29:18] <ugexe> i kind of wonder if you were somehow relying on buggy behavior
[15:29:22] <Xliff> Last time I could run the app server was about this time last week. Not it won't run.
[15:30:49] <Xliff> Let's see... I guess I can drop it back to...ff6951f59
[15:30:50] <Xliff> ?
[15:31:04] <Xliff> But there was a crash bug for that so... later
[15:31:19] <ugexe> for instance previous `perl6 -I foo1/ -I foo2/ -e '{ use Foo:ver<1>; say Foo::my-version(); }; { use Foo:ver<2>; say Foo::my-version(); }'` would print 1 twice instead of 1 2
[15:31:27] <ugexe> because it was reusing the wrong precomp file
[15:32:00] <ugexe> so its certainly possible there is new legit precompilation going on for you
[15:32:23] <Xliff> Maybe I'll try 308d6856 and see if that works.
[15:32:29] <ugexe> of course with how elaborate some of the things you appear to work on are it probably shouldnt surprise me if there is some weird edge case

[15:40:40] <Xliff> Does 8d1f24f contain the fix?
[15:42:02] <Xliff> I'd probably have to build from MoarVM in stages.
[15:42:04] <ugexe> no, i made 3 revisions of my fix. that commit is prior to the first one
[15:42:58] <ugexe> i dont see how it would help but i'd suggest s{/lib}{} where possible

[15:43:59] <Xliff> [Coke]: Yes. In MoarVM
[15:44:15] <Xliff> Howeever HEAD rakudo is now breaking things further for the same project.
[15:52:51] <ugexe> Xliff, just revert the three commits by me from the last few days
[15:53:56] <Xliff> ugexe: That's what I will try next after this last bit of debugging.
[15:54:48] <ugexe> im trying it locally but i only got a few minutes before i need to get to other work
[16:00:23] <ugexe> hmm, lots of dependencies im having to install one-by-one. maybe a meta6.json would be useful in that regard
[16:00:27] <Xliff> ugexe: Thanks.
[16:00:45] <Xliff> ugexe: There is an install-prereqs file
[16:00:58] <Xliff> It's incomplete, you will need to add Method::Also and CompUnit::Util to the list 
[16:01:53] <ugexe> ah my moar-blead doesn't have the segfault fix
[16:03:18] <ugexe> im out of time for now but if you could post the RAKUDO_MODULE_DEBUG=1 for when it works correctly vs incorrectly, as well as pointing out at what point you think its wrong, it would speed up my investigation
[16:04:17] <Xliff> ugexe: if I have the time to do so, I will.
[16:04:24] <Xliff> Thanks for all of the support.

[17:16:53] <guifa> o.O
[17:24:21] <guifa> So after much wailing and gnashing of teeth, and flipping around different environments, etc. I think I finally tracked down the source of error (as well as fixed a ton of little calculation bugs that), and put simply, the bug may have nothing to do with new-disp, and somehow is caused by a difference in files generated by TZ's helper utility.  Identical source files produced non-identical binary data files, the latter of which appear to b
[17:24:22] <guifa> truncated

[17:26:38] *** Joins: Sgeo (~Sgeo@user/sgeo)
[17:31:45] <guifa> I don't think so.  The ZIC tool (converts a human readable format to binary) is pure C and when I run my updater script, it just downloads, compiles, and runs it, and I can't find any commits in their code that could result in different processing. 
[17:33:08] <guifa> Hopefully I can find some time to build a bunch of different versions of ZIC and figure out where things went wrong — I can't imagine them having introduced such a radical bug and not have the mailing list blow up, so it's got to be something on me

[18:22:18] <xinming_> SmokeMachine: in lib/Red/ResultAssociative.pm6 the method keys should  returns(Any) instead of returns(Int), Because when people do DISTINCT, people do it on strings too.
[18:22:30] <xinming_> DISTINCT on text too

[18:28:28] <xinming_> Or maybe, We make it return Str, Which is more proper
[18:49:31] <[Coke]> ^^ I disagree with the statement that "all multi signatures found... should be documented" - It's existence in Rakudo doesn't mean it's part of the spec.
[18:50:07] <[Coke]> I agree it's a decent first pass, however.
[18:51:14] <moritz_> if you have two signatures :($) and :($, $), you can also document it as :($, $?)
[18:51:37] <moritz_> doesn't matter for the user that it's implemented as two multis

[19:04:25] <[Coke]> Agreed. most tests in roast are checking to see if you get a certain behavior when you invoke a method, not that you get X methods with those signatures.
