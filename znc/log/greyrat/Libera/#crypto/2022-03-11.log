[00:15:41] <ms7821> rumour was they're going chinese firewall from 11th
[00:15:45] <ms7821> which is... tomorrow
[00:21:02] <ms7821> guess this is more NK than China
[00:22:35] <[itchyjunk]> I thought Ru has sort of their own firewall anyways.
[00:22:47] <[itchyjunk]> Even their SWIFT alternative is different than Chinese.
[00:23:03] <ms7821> interesting they issues it at like midnight at the end of 1st March. very "fuck, panic" vibes

[00:24:56] <Peng> I'm surprised they didn't have it sitting around already
[00:25:31] <ms7821> same tbh. Makes me think it's is more of a continuity thing for now
[00:25:50] <Peng> Yeah
[00:25:57] <ms7821> because people are talking about refusing to deal with .ru domains (which is a bad idea)
[00:28:02] <Peng> Government agencies and sanctioned companies need certs too, and may have a hard time getting 'em.
[00:28:07] <Peng> Which is of course the point of sanctions
[00:28:17] <[itchyjunk]> What does kicking ru out of some standard DNS get anyone?
[00:28:32] <[itchyjunk]> Like you said, they just start their own Root CA and move on?
[00:28:57] <ms7821> nothing, which is why ICANN have refused to do it
[00:29:11] <[itchyjunk]> Is it even up to them to make such decision?
[00:29:15] <ms7821> yes?
[00:29:19] <[itchyjunk]> I think they said they wouldn't if they could.
[00:29:24] <[itchyjunk]> Not that the refused because they could.
[00:29:49] <ms7821> it is literally icann's job
[00:29:56] <[itchyjunk]> ICANN doesn't deal with political ethics though.
[00:30:00] <Peng> ICANN's main strategy is to sell out the public to the maximum extent possible without getting sued or taken over by the government

[14:08:11] <ms7821> I thought you were using openssl enc

[14:18:36] <ano> ms7821: didn't find a way to apply kdf on passphrase via openssl enc
[14:20:17] <ms7821> -pass uses a kdf
[14:21:09] <ms7821> it's not a good one unless you use pbkdf2 but it's a kdf
[14:21:16] <ms7821> -pbkdf2
[14:22:14] <ms7821> but maybe step back a bit and explain why you need qemu to be able to decrypt stuff with a passphrase in the first place?
[14:35:24] <ano> https://qemu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system/secrets.html#passing-secrets-via-the-linux-keyring in my case qemu uses master key + keys to encrypt imgs, master key passed to qemu via linux keyring, but while padded/stripped passphrase key is not good as static length hash/kdf from that passphrase (right?) i'm trying to figure out "how to prepare/process passphrase before add to linux keyring" and
[14:35:24] <ano> only way i found for now is prepare pp via (echo -n pp | nettle-pbkdf2 -l32 0)
[14:37:28] <ms7821> > padded/stripped passphrase key is not good as static length hash/kdf from that passphrase
[14:37:31] <ms7821> I don't follow
[14:37:48] <ms7821> if you want to encrypt stuff with a secret from your keyring, just store the key itself
[14:38:17] <ms7821> if you're dealing with > 128 bits of entropy there's not much between any of these mechanisms
[14:40:13] <ano> ms7821: so zero-padded "abc" pp better than kdf/hash of "abc"
[14:40:19] <ano> s/better/same/
[14:41:37] <ms7821> they're the same
[14:41:41] <ms7821> why wouldn't they be?
[14:47:34] <ano> ms7821: dunno, from my amateurish point of view things encrypted with static gibberish generated from "abc" rather than just "abc" much more resistant
[14:48:27] <ms7821> resistant to what? guessing the "abc"?
[14:48:36] <ano> at least
[14:48:40] <ms7821> how?
[14:49:08] <ms7821> crackers generally don't work by running the output backwards, they work by guessing the input
[14:49:47] <ms7821> so sha1("abc") is basically identical to "abc" to an attacker
[14:50:23] <ms7821> pbkdf2 can be configured to force the attacker to do more work, but that's only important if you're using weak passwords as input
[14:50:33] <ms7821> rather than something you've stored in your keyring
[14:51:05] <ms7821> and if you're using passphrases, a 4-word passphrase is plenty
[14:51:41] <ms7821> but use 6 if you're paranoid and want future-proofing

[17:21:08] <piou> if we're talking about session tokens, then storing a hash would be useful in case the database leaks without you noticing, but it's much less  important than with passwords because session tokens are by essence temporary, not reused on other websites, and if you notice the leak you can invalidate all of them at once, you don't need the painful process of asking users to set new passwords

[23:32:03] <maroon> int-e, im doing horribly trying to make my own sieve in c#. with a range 10 million candidates tested against the smallest 400k primes up through 5 million-ish, it takes me most of an hour :(
[23:32:40] <halosghost> maroon: I'm surprised to hear mention of C# in performance-related conversations
[23:32:59] <halosghost> maroon: isn't the GC and managed environment kind of always going to be a downer on tight-loop code?
[23:33:31] <int-e> only if the inner loop allocates
[23:33:38] <halosghost> ($FORMER_DAYJOB was in C#, and I wasn't ever particularly impresed with .NET{,Core,Framework}'s performance)
[23:33:53] <int-e> is it a sieve, or trial division?
[23:36:12] <maroon> it's a sieve, i have a byte[1000000] array containing the distance between each prime, and byte[10million] array of candidates , so i can build the list of small primes quickly, and then once i find a candidate that's a multiple of nthprime, i then mark-off every nthprime item in candidates[]
[23:37:21] <maroon> the 1st array is the distance between the smallest 1million primes, so i can get the nth prime by adding all the diff's together, and the nth+1 prime is the prior prime plus the next increment
[23:37:49] *** Quits: tomaw (tom@libera/staff/tomaw) (Quit: Quitting)
[23:38:09] <maroon> the slow part is, as my smallprimes become not-so-small, there's a lot of testing before finally stumbling across a multiple
[23:39:35] <halosghost> a sieve cannot be parallelized, right? (it, definitionally, requires previous iterations to have completed before the next one can execute, right?)
[23:40:56] <maroon> when sieving to find all the primes below N, you start at the lowest unmarked number, add it to your list of primes, but then just mark off all every Nth number greater than N^2
[23:41:25] <maroon> but if your range starts at 2^N you cant do that
[23:43:46] <maroon> and my candidates are 12n-1 numbers at intervals of 2^64, so my distance between candidates ends up being (2^64 mod Nth prime), and im having trouble finding a fast way to identify the 1st candidate that's a multiple of nth prime by simply knowing candidate#1-mod-NthPrime

[23:50:45] <int-e> Hmm, are you trying to replicate those numbers that end in 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF?
[23:51:20] <maroon> yes
[23:52:29] <maroon> i know my interval is actually 3*2^64, since that's the interval where the number can be 24k+23

[23:54:48] <int-e> maroon: https://paste.debian.net/1233866/ isn't the stupidest approach, I think
[23:55:58] <int-e> The obvious alternative is to find p^-1 (mod 2^64) using the extended euclidean algorithm
[23:56:34] <int-e> maroon: note that this becomes nicer if you divide by 2 at each step... and you will want to divide by 2^64 in the end.
[23:57:28] <int-e> (and you don't actually care about x either; you only casde about ((a + x) p - c) / 2^64, which is t)
[23:57:48] <int-e> casde -> care (how?)
[23:59:58] <int-e> maroon: ironically the discrepancy between 2^64 and 3*2^64 did confuse me.
