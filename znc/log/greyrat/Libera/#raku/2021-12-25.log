[04:42:13] <[Coke]> how do I stop getting notifications about raku-community-modules?
[04:42:14] <tellable6> 2021-12-24T19:38:56Z #raku <tbrowder> [Coke] i ran the tests and i think the pertinent ones passed. and the actual code example ran in the prog i built for it on my local host.
[04:43:29] <[Coke]> tbrowder: "the prog you built" - was the prog somehow different from the code in the snippet?
[04:44:21] <tbrowder> no, the same code.
[04:45:11] <[Coke]> ok. the last attempt I saw also failed so I reverted it as well.
[04:45:36] <[Coke]> if it passed for you, maybe we need a tie breaker. I am running 2021.10
[04:46:16] <tbrowder> there was no ‚Äúxt‚Äù target,  but an ‚Äúxtest‚Äù target.
[04:46:27] <[Coke]> yes. xt is the folder.
[04:47:07] <[Coke]> (stop getting notifications) well, leaving the org works. done
[04:47:18] <tbrowder> i don‚Äôt know how you are seeing the failure.p

[04:48:36] <tbrowder> have you tried the example on yr local host? maybe it‚Äôs the mac problem

[04:49:35] <[Coke]> and it's not. it's a my, not a has.
[04:49:38] <tbrowder> that passed for me, running linux debian 10 and rakudo 2021.10
[04:49:41] <[Coke]> Your code seems incorrect.

[04:50:55] <[Coke]> ^^&
[04:51:01] <[Coke]> So, not just me.
[04:51:17] <tbrowder> look at my pr
[04:51:32] <[Coke]> I would verify when you run it standalone you're running the code you think you are, and that you don't have any local modifications to the file.
[04:51:47] <[Coke]> URL?
[04:51:48] <tbrowder> my  $counter;
[04:51:52] <[Coke]> I was looking at *what you committed*
[04:52:46] <tbrowder> look at my pr which i did not commit. it was done after your revert
[04:53:02] <[Coke]> *facepalm*
[04:53:14] <[Coke]> as I said - if the tests pass for you, go ahead and commit it.

[04:56:06] <tbrowder> ok, but i haven‚Äôt looked at the pr since i submitted it. won‚Äôt it show a good test if it passes the xt tests?
[04:56:39] <[Coke]> No. the xt tests are "extra" they are not run as part of the normal process.
[04:56:47] <[Coke]> apparently I am the only person that runs them.
[04:57:21] <[Coke]> I hope that folks with direct commit bits or large PRs will run the tests as part of their normal workflow.
[04:57:52] <[Coke]> the checks run on PRs get you 'make test', basically.
[04:59:41] <tbrowder> ok, i‚Äôm confident it works, but i would feel better if you could inspect  my code changes in the pr first. note also the important changes in the adjacent text.
[05:01:31] <tbrowder> as an aside, the classtut file seems to me to be a bit disorganized after these 4+ yrs of updates.
[05:03:09] <tbrowder> i accept the lashes for not running the xt tests when i should, but i will try to remember to do that
