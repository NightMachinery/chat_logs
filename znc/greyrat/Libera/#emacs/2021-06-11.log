[03:01:37] <fsbot> splash is [0] a work of art whose creation is documented at http://www.ee.ryerson.ca/~elf/emacs/logo/
[03:01:37] <fsbot> [1] to disable it try --no-splash or (setq inhibit-startup-message t)

[03:02:04] <johnjay> ironically most posts i see are how to get RID of the startup screen, not make the logo customized
[03:02:14] <kakuhen> what's strange is that emacs on os x doesn't need any configuration to remove the image
[03:02:27] <johnjay> apparently emacs doesn't like it if the frame is the wrong size, the font is too big, or the picture is the wrong dimension

[05:33:14] <_73> I need a function that takes a buffer, and if there is a window with that buffer it switches the users focus to that window.

[05:35:24] <_73> thank you
[05:36:05] <aidalgol> kakuhen: I think that's stretching the definition of "movement" a bit.
[05:36:38] <mwnaylor> What if the window is open in an emacsclient that is on a different virtual desktop?
[05:37:44] <aidalgol> mwnaylor: What's a "virtual desktop" in this context?
[05:37:56] <kakuhen> aidalgol: the definition works for me :)
[05:38:09] <mwnaylor> I have done the standard switch-to-buffer C-x b, and nothing happened.
[05:38:33] <aidalgol> kakuhen: What I mean is that "moving parts" almost always means "mechanical".
[05:38:38] <aidalgol> Electrons don't count.
[05:38:58] <kakuhen> almost always, right? ;)
[05:39:17] <aidalgol> kakuhen: Yes, unless you're talking to an intolerable pedant. :P
[05:40:11] <aidalgol> mwnaylor: Also, emacsclient doesn't have windows open itself.  It's more of a remote control for an emacs server, so when you run emacsclient, you're telling the server to open a window.
[05:40:12] <mwnaylor> aidalgol: I am running Xmonad. I have 9 desktops available. If am using one client desktop 3, and I use that function to active a buffer that's in a window on a client in desktop 1, what happens?

[06:05:29] <aidalgol> bkhl: I meant the "describe "..." it ..." format.
[06:07:10] <bkhl> I don't see anything preventing you from just using that to label your tests, without following any BDD practices.
[06:08:26] <bkhl> But I'd probably have used neutral keywords like just "suite" and "test"
[06:09:08] <aidalgol> Actually, I'm a liar.  I forgot that's essentially what ExUnit uses, and I'm fine with it.
[06:09:53] <bkhl> I'm also fine with it, but then at work currently I'm seriously experimenting with using something Gherkin-like for specs
[06:10:07] <aidalgol> Ugh, gherkin...

[06:10:25] <aidalgol> ah
[06:10:53] <aidalgol> Even so... Because apparently "precondition" is too hard a concept to explain to clients. :P

[16:30:40] <contrapunctus> A friend of mine has a fancypants setup using `setxkbmap -option ctrl:swapcaps` (swaps Caps Lock with Left Ctrl) in conjunction with `xcape` (whose man page says that by default it makes Left Ctrl send Esc if pressed and released by itself)...the result being that their Caps Lock works as both Esc and Ctrl. :o
