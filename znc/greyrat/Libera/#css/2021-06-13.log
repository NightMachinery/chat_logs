[03:14:37] <carlino3> hi
[03:14:51] <carlino3> i need to animate a revolver cylinder spinning. i solved it this way: https://jsfiddle.net/01gsyok6/1/. could this have a negative impact in browser performance? considering that the background-position-y property of the element grows each time we click the button, without any limitation.
[03:25:22] <entuland> why don't you use keyframe animations?
[03:25:51] <entuland> actually, that's working fine already
[03:26:07] <hassoon> carlino3: since you're manipulating the animation with javascript, try to reset the background-position-y property evey 200% or so, just to make sure you're using sane values
[03:26:59] <entuland> oh, I missed the point about the property value
[03:27:08] <hassoon> carlino3: and yes, preparing a keyframes animation that you toggle would be easier and faster, as entuland suggested toggling the animation
[03:27:11] <entuland> yeah, I wouldn't tackle that via JS
[03:27:17] <hassoon> * suggested .
[03:27:33] <hassoon> entuland: ya he is just increasting that value infinitely
[03:27:59] <entuland> yep, just adding the class would be okay, without altering the values via JS
[03:28:38] <carlino3> hassoon i already tried that approach, but it is very difficult to find the right % value to use for recycling the animation
[03:28:56] <carlino3> it doesn't looks smooth, it looks like some frame is missing
[03:29:23] <carlino3> (i meant, restart the animation cycle, not recyling)
[03:30:10] <carlino3> entuland i have to control this via JS
[03:30:49] <entuland> not sure I get the point of the missing frames
[03:30:50] <entuland> https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/ctpbnroe/
[03:30:57] <entuland> is that animation on hover not smooth for you?
[03:31:28] <hassoon> entuland: ya very smooth
[03:32:44] <carlino3> entuland yes, it seems like i didn't explained the problem well
[03:32:50] <entuland> this version animates only on hover-on- not on hover-out: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/67eg1p2o/
[03:32:58] <carlino3> the cylinder should spin only in one direction, downwards
[03:33:11] <entuland> yeah, I got that point, check the latest link above
[03:33:27] <entuland> you just have to add a class instead of using hover, and remove that class once you're done with the animation
[03:33:41] <entuland> assuming you need to control that via JS
[03:33:51] <hassoon> ^ js
[03:33:53] <entuland> that way you don't have to mess with the property value at all via JS
[03:34:15] <carlino3> that looks better, i'll try it
[03:36:01] <carlino3> entuland: now, to spin infinitely, how would you do?
[03:36:14] <carlino3> you need to reset the background-position-y property to 0% when it reaches 150%
[03:36:18] <hassoon> carlino3: keyframes animation
[03:39:48] <entuland> ^ that, yes, you need keyframes, can't do the loop with that transition
[03:40:22] <carlino3> ok, i'll try to do it with keyframes
[03:40:29] <carlino3> thank you folks
[03:40:32] <entuland> yw
[03:46:02] <hassoon> carlino3: https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/283
[03:48:03] <hassoon> carlino3: if you are fine with the cylinder restarting from positio 9 instead of continuing from the position at which it stopped before, you're all setup
[03:48:28] <hassoon> * position 0 *
[03:48:53] <carlino3> hassoon it is supossed to be a revolver cylinder, so it should always stop "aligned"
[03:49:11] <hassoon> what dp you mean by stop aligned
[03:49:17] <entuland> it will always stop aligned
[03:49:31] <entuland> but it will "jump" if you block the animation midway
[03:49:43] <entuland> if you want to prevent that, you need to control the removal of the class via JS
[03:49:45] <hassoon> ya was worried about that jumping
[03:49:46] *** Joins: rannnn8888 (~rannnn888@bzq-79-176-155-8.red.bezeqint.net)
[03:49:50] <carlino3> entuland that
[03:49:53] <entuland> so that it happens when the animation has completed
[03:50:18] <carlino3> if you toggle of the class in your example while the cylinder is "spinning" and not aligned, it will "skip some frames"
[03:50:37] <carlino3> is there any way to let the animation continue until it is aligned using pure CSS?
[03:50:41] <hassoon> what do you mean by aligbed
[03:50:53] <hassoon> * aligned *
[03:50:54] <entuland> no, I don't think it's possible to do that with pure CSS
[03:51:05] <carlino3> hassoon that the backgrund starts at position 0
[03:51:18] <entuland> you need to control the removal of the class and do it "just at the right moment"
[03:51:29] <entuland> to account for the "cancellation" of the spin midway the cycle
[03:51:31] <carlino3> yeah
[03:51:37] <carlino3> so i will need js anyway
[03:51:40] <hassoon> entuland: his cylinder always starts from 0, what else is he worried about
[03:51:56] <entuland> he's worried about stopping the animation at, say, 25%
[03:52:05] <carlino3> sorry, it is hard to explain it
[03:52:10] <carlino3> yes
[03:52:11] <entuland> that will cause the background to suddenly jump from 25% to zero
[03:52:40] <hassoon> entuland: that's true, so he prefers the cylinder to stop at 25%, and continue from there later ?
[03:52:58] <entuland> no, he wants the animation to continue till 150% and stop there
[03:52:59] <entuland> I guess
[03:54:05] <hassoon> entuland: ah, even simpler, he should work wit hthe animation(start/end) event(s) and syncronise that with the button that toggles the spinning
[03:54:21] <entuland> yep
[03:54:26] <hassoon> carlino3: ^
[03:55:50] <hassoon> entuland: he can also revert bac to his initial js-only approach, and just reset the position to 0 when it e.g reaches 150%, to avoid infinite position values
[03:56:10] <hassoon> entuland: he was already pretty close with his initial approach, he just needs to take care of the values
[03:56:23] <carlino3> hassoon that was my first try, but it is hard to find the right percentage to use for restarting the spin cycle without having "jumps"
[03:57:00] <entuland> something has to give, you need to accept a compromise somewhere
[03:57:07] <hassoon> carlino3: that's easy, find it by changing the postiion manually in the dev tools
[03:57:08] <entuland> https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/284
[03:57:37] <entuland> key point there is having 0.5 (in the animation duration) match the 500ms in the interval
[03:57:48] <entuland> the click will only take care of setting the flag
[03:57:57] <hassoon> entuland: pretty Ãmuch better animation
[03:58:05] <entuland> the operation can only be started or stopped at that half a second granularity
[03:58:38] <carlino3> entuland that's a good idea, thanks
[03:59:07] <entuland> yw
[04:00:24] <carlino3> yes, i think all i need is a keyframe animation to spin the cylinder one position, and control the rest via JS
[04:04:44] <entuland> since you're specifying the sizes in px, the background position there is just 30px for the 100% keyframe
[04:05:00] <entuland> easier than trying to match it with % values
[04:05:14] <entuland> that's your 1-step value
[04:06:29] <entuland> if you want you can also change the way the time is taken to account for slower motion (say, one second per step) but allow starting at any time (not only every 1 second since when the script started running)
[04:07:03] <entuland> but that is slightly more complex, requires keeping track of the starting milliseconds, and is likely going to cause small framedrops here and there

[04:18:11] <entuland> if at all possible, avoid this technique (just to explain what I meant with the above): https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/285
[04:18:43] <entuland> the above allows for arbitrarily long animations without limiting when they can be started (only when they can be stopped, cause it's a stated requirement)
[04:20:26] <entuland> actually, I'm an idiot
[04:20:39] <entuland> we can start the interval only when the user clicks
[04:20:57] <entuland> no need to keep track of the milliseconds
[04:23:26] <entuland> https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/286
[04:24:18] <entuland> the above technique can be used just fine
[04:33:33] <hassoon> 90px is the #cylinder 's height, and it has 3 equal rectangles.. good idea

[08:56:38] <howdoi> we can't make grid responsive with fractional abs frs? https://codesandbox.io/s/ny82j
[09:07:18] <AMcBain> howdoi, in what sense? fr is typically meant for the remainder, so while you likely can supply them for all items, as you did, you may not get the results you want.
[09:07:34] <AMcBain> At least one item needs a real value in order to technically have a remainder.
[09:08:21] <howdoi> AMcBain: I was trying to achieve something like repeat(auto-fit, minmax(240px, 1fr)); but with both row and column
[09:08:46] <howdoi> like stack the layout for mobile view and fit accordingly for tablet and desktop
[09:09:10] <AMcBain> Well you can supply different values for grid-template-* inside of @media to rearrange when necessary.
[09:09:17] <howdoi> that header, profile-pic, links, footer; grid-area basically
[09:09:38] <howdoi> we can't do it without media queries?
[09:11:33] <howdoi> also, and img with object-fit: cover;width: 100%;max-height: 100%; within the profile-pic fails to be responsive AMcBain
[09:11:35] <AMcBain> Er, well what do you mean? If you want to change how things arrange themselves then afaik you would need to specify new values for things like grid-template-areas. Same as if you'd used flex and wanted horizontal things to flip vertical when there's not enough space, you have to tell it to do flex-direction: column;
[09:11:57] <AMcBain> Ahhh, hang on.
[09:12:44] <AMcBain> So cover is what you'd use if you know you're asking the img tag to take up space that doesn't necessarily match the aspect of the image, so asking it to be both width: 100%; and max-height: 100%; is a bit odd for cover. You'd be (imo) more likely to see things like width: 100%; height: 100%; or similar to fit the space you want it to take, then apply cover to ensure that entire space is filled with the image.
[09:12:49] <AMcBain> cover will clip the image.
[09:13:09] <AMcBain> If you want all of the image to be shown in the space you provide, which is still not a case for max-height: 100%;, then you want contain.
[09:16:36] <howdoi> AMcBain: I was looking into https://css-tricks.com/look-ma-no-media-queries-responsive-layouts-using-css-grid/
[09:16:36] <howdoi> Thanks for the detailed response, I tried contain before let me try, I am trying to fit the image responsively in that grid-area
[09:17:41] <AMcBain> I guess I don't know what you mean by "responsively" here for images. Respecting image aspect and filling the available space can both be done "responsively" depending on your view, but they can be complete opposites.
[09:18:29] <AMcBain> As above specifying a max-height and a width will do the former, and ignore the direction for image-fit since it'll take up exactly as much space as it needs.
[09:18:44] <AMcBain> image-fit only applies if you're taking up way more space than it needs or less than it needs.
[09:19:13] <AMcBain> + in violation of its aspect ratio, I should say.
[09:25:36] <howdoi> well, with just max-height and width, the image is losing it's aspect ratio
[09:28:27] <AMcBain> Well if it's directly in the grid, then yeah, the grid specs for columns and rows are going to force its dimensions and ignore aspect.
[09:29:06] <AMcBain> This is where object-fit: contain; comes into play.
[09:30:30] <howdoi> got it! cool
[09:30:43] <howdoi> so, will stick with media query
