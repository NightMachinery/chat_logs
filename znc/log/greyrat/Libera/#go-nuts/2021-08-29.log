[04:33:54] <b0nn> saml: I meant to also say, that because your problem is really a CAP issue,and you have Consistency as a requirement, then you will need to sacrifice some availability /or/ some partitionability, but, you do have the chance to partition your data into shards (eg. if username starts with A it goes into shard A, or even Aa goes to Aa and Ab goes to Ab, and so on

[04:34:40] <b0nn> You'd be sacrificing a tiny bit of availability, because your system will need to figure out which shard it's holding the appropriate information in, but it's not impossible
[04:35:31] <b0nn> The other option would be highly available, but sacrifice the abaility to partition (ie. all of the usernames are in one data store
[04:35:45] <b0nn> But that's not scaleable

[05:40:19] <Sam> I tend to think that's because the GNU licenses put all the pain of dealing with them on the user. If I wrote my library with a different license that's not compatible I'm screwed and may be in violation of the GPL even if I was trying to act in good faith and the solution, for some reason, is that I can't use the license I want. Meanwhile, open source licenses are so vague that corporations can exploit your
[05:40:19] <Sam> work without bothering to give anything back, even their own modifications. It seems like there must be a better way that still forces companies to give back but without requiring changes to their own licenses.

[05:49:49] <TUSF> I think LGPL was meant to be the compromise there (The less "free" license)... but it assumes you're working with C/C++, and external libraries you can import at runtime.
[05:52:40] <Sam> Yah, they're all rather poorly done (which is how I feel about almost everything GNU does, TBF)
[05:52:59] <TUSF> They're not poorly done. They're antagonistic towards copyright. lol.
[05:53:41] <TUSF> (towards copyright, and towards proprietary software in general)
[05:57:30] <TUSF> The fact proprietary software can't use them is the point. And while I'd love all companies to release their code, I'd also like more middle ground licenses.

[06:05:42] <Sam> That part is fine, the part where it also puts pressure on non-proprietary stuff and where it's over specific in some places and incredibly vague in others is the problem.
[06:06:36] <Sam> Anyways, I feel like there must be a better alternative that puts pressure on the companies and people trying to abuse it, not just normal libraries or whatever that happened to use a license that doesn't work with GPL.
[06:06:57] <Sam> Maybe an open source license combined with something like the commons clause.

[06:13:30] <TUSF> > also puts pressure on non-proprietary
[06:14:05] <TUSF> This is because non-proprietary OSS can still be used in proprietary software... which the GPL wants to avoid.

[21:20:24] <lilgopher> I'm going to start using uber-go/zap. When should I use .infof and when should I use .infow? infof uses the same format as Printf, Infow uses different columns I think
[21:20:57] <lilgopher> I guess I dont know the advantages of Infow, if any
[21:24:29] <j416> lilgopher: what do the docs say?
[21:24:49] <lilgopher> it just says that Infow adds additional context
[21:26:29] <j416> if you need keyvalue pairs for structured logging, use that, if not, infof?
[21:26:50] *** Quits: elf-fortrez (~elf-fortr@adsl-72-50-7-254.prtc.net) (Quit: Client closed)
[21:26:55] <j416> you can always wrap a logger using .With to add keyvalue pairs as well
[21:26:59] <j416> for context
[21:28:02] <lilgopher> yeah, I think I will just use Infof until I figure if Infow will be actually useful, I was asking in case most people use Infow all the time or something like that
[21:28:05] <lilgopher> thanks
[21:28:11] <j416> also looks like both .Infof and .Infow are extra options only available on SugaredLogger; might want to read up on the idea behind that
[21:28:20] <j416> perhaps you'll be fine with just Logger?
[21:28:27] <lilgopher> yeah, I noticed that, Im using suggared for now
[21:28:48] <j416> disclaimer; I've never used uber/zap; just reciting from the docs.
[21:30:55] <lilgopher> hmm, I could probably get away with using just Logger now that you mention it
[21:31:20] <j416> I'd try to keep it simple unless you have reason to add more
[21:34:34] <j416> also think about how you will be using these logs; structured logging might make them easier to grep/parse
[21:34:56] <j416> printf-style logging I suppose might be more readable at times, for a human
[21:35:58] <lilgopher> yeah, I guess Infow creates new json fields that can facilitate grouping logs by fields, etc
[21:36:16] <lilgopher> also I want leveled logs so I guess I do need SuggaredLogger
[21:37:51] <j416> Logger doesn't have levels?
[21:38:37] <lilgopher> the readme says Logger only supports structured logging
[21:39:55] <lilgopher> Ill have to try it just in case "structured logging" includes leveling

[21:47:54] <dyeplexer> If a person decides to switch the hosting repository for a package, say from github to gitlab (or host on both as a mirror), should the package be renamed/refactored if it is prefixed by a URL to reflect the new one (eg. "github.com/jstemmer/gotags")?

[21:51:05] <Tv_> lilgopher: personally, i don't use the SugaredLogger thing at all
[21:51:20] <Tv_> zap.Fields are your friends, none of this %v crap in my structured logs
[21:52:22] <Tv_> dyeplexer: for github.com, yes it needs to change; this is one argument for using vanity domains
[21:52:24] <lilgopher> hahah, good to know, I will think about not using it, using the plain Logger is faster but introduces the overhead of the zap.Fields
[21:52:45] <Tv_> lilgopher: i wouldn't call that "overhead", it's faster and simpler and everything else builds on top of that
[21:53:12] <lilgopher> hmm, I'll take a look at them, I have to admit I didnt even look at them when I saw I had to use them
[21:53:18] <dyeplexer> Tv_: as in a domain that will redirect to the current working repository?
[21:53:28] <lilgopher> thanks Tv_

[23:15:13] <SuperLag> I'm reading some example code, and I've got a question. "func Signin(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)" <-- in that what are the standalone "w" and "r"? Are those like abbreviations?
[23:16:03] <ikke> they are the variables that represent those parameters
[23:16:15] <ikke> or do you mean as a type signature?
[23:16:58] <SuperLag> when I look at the docs for the http package, it shows "ResponseWriter" and "Request" as types... but what you said makes more sense
[23:17:20] <SuperLag> my problem is that I know >< about Go, and I'm trying to do a simple project
[23:17:37] <SuperLag> I'm just jumping in the deep end.
[23:17:57] <ikke> http.ResponseWriter and http.Request are the types
[23:18:29] <fizzie> Well, `*http.Request`. I mean, sure, `http.Request` is also a type, but not the type of the parameter `r`.
[23:18:45] <SuperLag> I'd like to write a Go app that reads creds, and auths to an API, makes a call, and the results get dumped to a CSV file.
