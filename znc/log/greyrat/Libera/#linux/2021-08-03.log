[00:55:52] <ahungry> grep is 100% consistent - for each line given to it as input (whether from file sources, or stdin/pipe) it will apply the PATTERNS - if the PATTERNS match, the line is printed.  Invisible characters count as characters

[01:23:52] <ayecee> a usb-connected hard drive or ssd would certainly be fast enough. web-browsing speed is not normally connected to your external storage speed.

[02:03:29] <ayecee> so, writing to flash is fast, but erasing it is slow, and the minimum size for an erase is much larger than the minimum write. with me so far?
[02:03:43] <TechSmurf> ralinux: In general, no, it's not the end of the world, but if the update fixes a vulnerability and your lack of updating allows someone to exploit that vulnerability on your system, then it was a preventable failure.

[02:07:36] <ayecee> flash storage works around this by pre-erasing some blocks to accept writes. to erase more blocks, it has to copy all the data from erase block that hasn't been "overwritten" to a new block, and then erase the old block.
[02:07:47] *** Joins: rpthms (~rpthms@user/rpthms)
[02:08:55] <ayecee> copying all that data takes some time, and for flash drives, it often only happens when doing a write, so many small writes can appear very slow.

[02:20:18] <TechSmurf> SSDs are beautiful like that. The relationship between logical sectors and physical sectors is completely dynamic. This is also for wear-levelling (ensuring the entire drive wears evenly, rather than the drive failing prematurely due to excessive wear of a few blocks)

[07:53:52] <n4dir> i once heard or read that "barbar" was meant to say "bah-bah", saying someone is not able to speak properly. Back in the days, probably Rome
[07:54:33] <beltwaybob> And spelling doesn't even dictate pronounciation
[07:54:34] <neshpion> i wanted it to be part of grammar, but in this thread i'm reading proponents of spelling-is-grammar frequently invoked the fallacy of the undistributed middle term, reducing my hope to ash
[07:54:38] <beltwaybob> I parked the car in Harvard yard, for example
[07:54:58] <neshpion> i am thoroughly dejected, and will proceed to consume soil
[07:54:59] <beltwaybob> neshpion: well, it is purely stipulative, it's not like grammar and spelling are natural things
[07:55:15] <beltwaybob> It would depend if you were using a language that is oral and transcribed, or a language that is only written, if you can even call that a language
[07:55:40] <n4dir> stuff like perl?
[07:55:59] <neshpion> beltwaybob: on the contrary, i think studies on creole languages indicate that grammar is a natural occurrence in human populations.  spelling would be harder to defend, unless you include systems of abstraction as a natural emergent phenomena of human ingenuity
[07:56:26] <beltwaybob> neshpion: saying that something is a natural occurence in human populations basically naturalizes everything humans do, you end up having to call statuary natural because it occurs in human populations
[07:56:27] <neshpion> programming languages are only written and not spoken :^))))
[07:56:35] <beltwaybob> neshpion: of coruse, this is all going to depend on how you define natural vs. artificial

[07:58:18] <beltwaybob> But if you allow grammar to be natural, artificial structures imposed in language, like sttae of new hampshire, end up being natural
[07:58:21] <ayecee> is that.. is that a real town
[07:58:27] <neshpion> beltwaybob: i'm no neuroscientist, but there *are* regions of the brain basically dedicated to the interpretation and formulation of linguistic expressions, so i would lean towards language being naturally emergent from human evolution
[07:59:08] <Sauvin> I pocked my cah in Hahvahd Yahd.
[07:59:24] * neshpion tows Sauvin's cah
[07:59:27] <beltwaybob> neshpion: the problem is that if you have a scientific view of that, the region is defined by a physical phenomenon, so having a vibration hit the eardrum, which is transduced into a nerve impulse, which is interpretted by a section of the brain, which involves neurons and neurotransmitters, etc. is all you get

[07:59:50] <beltwaybob> neshpion: you end up with the "language" being a hallucination, a folk scientific myth like "god"
[08:00:07] <FloridaMan> how high are you?
[08:00:09] <beltwaybob> neshpion: it's this same problem of abstract nouns and rules-systems being naturalized when it's not like the brain operates according to rules, those are sort of a made up way of predicting what it will or will not do
[08:00:18] <n4dir> i think "structuralism" dealt with that problem,  beltwaybob
[08:00:22] <beltwaybob> Not really

[08:00:56] <beltwaybob> I think the best sort of academic analysis is Richard Rorty, but he is not really that satisfactory either

[08:01:57] <beltwaybob> neshpion: the issue is likely that hallucination has a good short/medium term survival value, e.g. you hallucinate colours in a jungle and you can pick out the types of leaves you should eat by hallucinating a colour when a specific wavelength is reflected onto your retina
[08:02:14] <beltwaybob> But in the long term, none of these adaptations are all that great, the bacteria will feast on the corpse of the last multi-celled organism

[08:16:35] <beltwaybob> neshpion: They fetishize their hallucination as a divnity or something "beyond the physical" etc. when it is pretty evidence that they're just crazy
[08:16:41] <beltwaybob> I mean, I know "crazy" is just another hallucination
[08:16:55] <beltwaybob> The other issue is with the use of nouns
[08:16:58] <beltwaybob> e.g. how does a sound become a noun
[08:17:06] <beltwaybob> Aristotle says kata suntheke, that is, by agreement or by treaty
[08:17:25] <beltwaybob> So there's really no way to make sense of language without some conception of agreement, and why is it that we are able to agree? Do we agree, or do we just think that we agree, like we think that we sin, etc.

[08:19:53] <beltwaybob> Sure, but if you are a behaviorist it literally eliminates abstractions like agreement
[08:20:14] <beltwaybob> You would go "oh, those are the noises that two people make if they are going to exchange food for money, and then those are the gestures they make"
[08:20:19] <beltwaybob> It would lose the abstract meaning
[08:20:27] <beltwaybob> The person itself is imaginary
[08:20:37] <neshpion> i'm not a behaviorist, but that doesn't mean i can't look at behaviors as evidence of people's states of mind, especially when deciding whether the concept of agreement is meaningful or not
[08:20:43] <beltwaybob> Aristotle's view of language is thta the reason we can have nouns is because these nouns refer to affections in the soul
[08:20:53] <beltwaybob> So it still relies on a unified concept of the soul/person, not a cortical or cybernetic understanding
[08:21:11] <beltwaybob> Well, you can look at them as evidence of their physiological state, but minds and bodies are different things
[08:21:30] <beltwaybob> Like, if you are going to say the mind is the body, why have two words for it? That is basically the point I am making
[08:21:43] <beltwaybob> A philosopher like Richard Rorty sort of ingores the question as intelligible for a lot of reasons which are not terribly bad
[08:22:03] <beltwaybob> e.g. are you a foundationalist, or do you just want to have conversations and get paid to have conversations and have enough $$$ to go on bird watching trips

[13:04:01] <mlu> shan: it's a bus -- so everything attached via I2C shares two pins: SCL (clock) and SDA (data)
[13:04:06] <shan> yeah
[13:04:21] <mlu> shan: you need to ssend packets on there: so it's a total of 100kHz and 400kHz for *all* devices
[13:04:28] <mlu> and it's half-duplex -- you're either reading or writing
[13:04:29] <shan> oh shit
[13:04:40] <mlu> think of it as a much slower ethernet
[13:05:06] <shan> and it's synchronous, so (say for example) my I/O expander is unusable while i'm reading/writing from the SD card?

[13:07:38] <shan> now how do i communicate with an SD card over SPI ;_;
[13:07:40] <mlu> same applies to SPI too -- SPI just uses CS lines and separate input/output instead of needing a device address for each packet
[13:07:49] <shan> being hamstrung by this stupid board's design is not fun

[14:05:01] <packopy> For example, if perhaps one wished to keep the same name reserved across all servers known, and unknown, how would one do so provided they've already done the /nickserv bit.
[14:06:27] <furrykef> I don't know
[14:06:51] <furrykef> And yes, NickServ registrations will be valid only on the network they were registered on
[14:07:00] <packopy> that is truely unfortunate.

[17:39:50] <Linuxnewbie> Hi! I don't know if I'm inquiring at the right place. I have a pretty old machine - and I know it would be high time to find something more modern, but unfortunately for now I have to settle with this one.  A few years ago (when the machine had not been considered so obsolete yet) I took it to a service technician, who suggested that in order to
[17:39:50] <Linuxnewbie> keep the machine more secure on the web I should use Linux (because for Windows my machine was too slow and old). It gave a hard time even for him to find the perfect one for this one, but with Rosa Linux it has been working excellently since then. Now however I am in a need of a software and I don't know if anyone could possibly help me how to
[17:39:51] <Linuxnewbie> install it correctly.
[17:39:53] <Psi-Jack> I do to, but, dunno's been used for quite a bit longer. I mean, I'm originally from Texas. "dunno" is quite common there.

[23:18:43] <neshpion> ayecee: the key to end procrastination is to have *two* projects going instead of one.  when you want to procrastinate on project A, you tinker on project B, and vice-versa, therefore you can always be procrastinating by getting things done
[23:18:47] <Guest3579> Article's a year old, might be updates around on what they actually did by now.
[23:19:10] <ayecee> that's some pro crastinating
[23:19:48] <Psi-Jack> Trying to ponder a simple idea of how to get a systemd service run by a systemd timer to specifically email it's report to a designated email.

[23:23:21] <Psi-Jack> Could possibly use an ExecStartPost, possibly.

[23:24:19] <ayecee> is there an OnSuccess
[23:24:45] <Psi-Jack> Well, that's ExecStartPost LOL
