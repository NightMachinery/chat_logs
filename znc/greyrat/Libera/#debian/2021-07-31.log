[01:16:53] <PMT> That appears to be a package Ubuntu has.
[01:17:05] <Payam> ah My package has a dependency to this
[01:17:49] <Payam> How do I install dependencies that are not in debian repos?
[01:18:37] <Payam> I mean when creating .deb packages
[01:19:30] <Payam> I need to package a project and one of the dependencies is firefox-geckodriver. is there a way of downloading it while installation of my package?
[01:19:31] <sney> if you need your package to be compatible with debian and ubuntu, then don't depend on anything that isn't available in one distro or another. you can set it as a Recommends if it isn't absolutely necessary

[01:20:29] <judd> Bug https://bugs.debian.org/874207 in firefox (open): «geckodriver: please enable»; severity: normal; opened: 2017-09-04; last modified: 2021-06-04.

[01:21:15] <judd> No package named 'firefox-esr-geckodriver' was found in buster/amd64.
[01:22:04] <sney> oh well. you'd probably have to host that package yourself then, the dsc and the info from that bug will probably help with the procedure 
[01:22:23] *** Joins: GoldAndAppel (goldandapp@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/goldandappel)
[01:23:35] <Payam> there is a github page with the binary. I was thinking to wget it from a script. but I don't know how to specify iy in debian control file
[01:23:44] *** Joins: dkmueller (~dkmueller@2a01:c22:7205:b400:2ca3:4ff:17cb:5f51)
[01:26:25] <sney> you can make a separate package that satisfies the dependency, and uses a script in postinst to download and install the binary. I believe this is against debian policy for packages in main, but it would probably work for your personal case
[01:26:52] <Payam> yeah
[01:27:19] *** Joins: luuuciano (~luuuciano@user/luuuciano)
[01:27:24] <sney> alternately, go to #debian-mentors on OFTC (note, right now you are on libera) and discuss getting firefox-geckodriver into debian. if you need it, and you're willing to do the work, that may be an ideal situation as then it'd be available for everyone

[01:28:42] <Payam> I don't know how far I would get
[01:29:35] <sney> you apparently know how to build debian packages, you need this package, and there's an open bug requesting it in debian. that makes you the perfect candidate to submit it.

[08:49:17] <coc0nut> may I ask if its hard to set up a vpn on a headless machine? I struggle abit to read deeply. I have this issue with my vpn provider. Its a cli interface. But to install it it needs a desktop environment and network manager. On my headless I installed network-manager and the dependencies. but it errors on connection. Logging in to my account works in the cli.

[08:57:12] <dpkg> Debian "Bullseye" is the current testing branch as of 2019-07-06 and it will be released "when it's ready." Release day we're working to currently - as discussed in various mailing lists is August 14th 2021. There's a hard freeze from July 17th with only the most urgent security fixes after that date. The main CD builder died - all disks failed at once, so the current target is August 14th, or even later.
[08:57:31] <PMT> Why do you require bullseye for an insulin pump?

[09:01:57] <PMT> coc0nut: I have no particular idea what their proprietary VPN client is doing. It is certainly possible to configure VPNs in general from the CLI only. You haven't specified what the error is, but it seems likely that they might be better equipped to help you than we can.
[09:03:41] <coc0nut> Yeah offcourse... And my error code is 400, which literally tells you nothing :p I just wonder why its such a problem to make it work on a cli only. I just dont know where to start doing this through openvpn cli only hehe
[09:04:03] <coc0nut> and also setting 10. Check the option for Use LZO data compression. is probably the thing
[09:05:32] <coc0nut> I have been contacting them and chatted with them . So hope theyre working on it
[09:05:56] <PMT> joze: if you need newer software versions than are available in buster, your options are to see if someone else has backported them and install them, backport and install them yourself, or install bullseye before it's released as stable. Personally, I'm not sure what the right level of confidence and stability is for controlling a life-altering medical device is, but I would suggest you consider it carefully 
[09:06:02] <PMT> before choosing. (Not because I think bullseye or buster are unstable or anything, but just because the threshold should be very high for things that can alter your life.) Obviously if you just want to passively monitor it, the stakes are somewhat lower.
[09:06:28] <PMT> (Though if you're going to make decisions based on it, that's not really just "passive" monitoring any more, just a layer of indirection...)
[09:06:42] <joze> PMT: I like fresh installs

[09:09:14] <PMT> joze: well, if you really want to install bullseye without going through buster first, there are installer images for it. They're intended for testing the installer, not for generally installing bullseye, but they will, modulo bugs, result in having bullseye installed afterward without passing through buster.
[09:10:58] <coc0nut> sid ?
[09:11:26] <PMT> I would probably recommend going through buster first, not because I know anything's broken about doing that, but just because I don't think there's going to be a significant difference for most people.

[09:13:13] <PMT> That seems like quite a bad idea to suggest, even as a joke.
[09:14:42] <coc0nut> joze, is your insuline pump really using debian operating system? :P
[09:15:10] <PMT> I assumed they meant it was necessary to run the software to talk to it, not to run on it.
[09:15:22] <PMT> If it were to run on it, I'd have larger questions.

[13:52:46] <n4dir> yup, that sucks when shutdown

[18:19:14] <topoi> "localectl list-keymaps" gives me "Failed to read list of keymaps: No such file or directory" but I'm not sure why. I've already generated some locales with locale-gen from /etc/locale.gen which worked fine.

[18:25:41] <topoi> Thanks PMT, I had not found this in the net; maybe I should have searched more Debian-specific.
[18:26:04] <PMT> It might not be the same thing, but it seems useful as background on how it differs with Debian even if it's not.
[18:30:39] <topoi> Is there something I miss as "localectl set-x11-keymap us thinkpad dvp" does nothing but returns with 0?

[22:15:30] <SnoopJ> Hi, I'm curious about a potential incompatibility between libsdl2 packages in Buster. We had a user in #python last night reporting an "undefined symbol SDL_RWclose" error from PyGame, and looking at their installed packages, they had libsdl2 @ 2.0.9, libsdl2-ttf-2.0-0 @ 2.0.15. I'm pretty sure 2.0.14 has a change that makes this combination incompatible (https://git.io/JBPnX). Am I on the right
[22:15:32] <SnoopJ> track? Is there any known issue of this sort?

[22:22:00] <Khepra> right
[22:22:21] <Khepra> welp, seem like it.

[22:24:13] <PMT> Their versions don't appear to be correlated, though.
[22:24:25] <SnoopJ> yea, that's kinda why I'm asking about it, I could just be wrong about the origin of the bug. It seems very unlikely there's been a landmine here for 2 years and nobody's stepped on it...?
[22:25:00] <PMT> That is - 2.0.14 of libsdl2 was December 2020, 2.0.14 of libsdl2-ttf was 2018.
[22:25:03] <SnoopJ> (sorry, the report was shared to a ephemeral paste service, so I don't have it)
[22:25:12] <Khepra> lots of programs use SDL and lots of people game natively on debian (ie. not via steam with its own run time). So I'm guessing it'd likely be reported, if it exist
[22:26:10] <Khepra> actually one game I play from time to time, Enigma uses both and I haven't noticed an issue...
[22:26:21] <PMT> Oh excuse me, I was too conservative, libsdl2-ttf was 2016. :P
[22:26:27] <SnoopJ> PMT, libsdl2-ttf does say it requires "the latest stable release of SDL 2.0"
[22:26:29] <xx> not even vuescan, which is supposed to have reverse-engineered support for all scanners, can see that scanner (and it is on the supported list)
[22:26:39] <PMT> SnoopJ: sure, but as of when? When it was released? Now?
[22:26:41] <xx> what could be wrong with my debian?
[22:26:55] <xx> I tried it on my laptop as well, which also runs debian, and it didn't work either
[22:26:56] <SnoopJ> PMT, good question. I was (perhaps naively) assuming the version number tracked against libsdl2, but maybe I'm wrong.
[22:27:05] <PMT> It doesn't, that's what I said.

[22:27:35] <PMT> libsdl2-ttf 2.0.14 was 2016. libsdl2 2.0.14 was 2020. And I don't mean in Debian, I mean "released upstream"
[22:27:53] <SnoopJ> libsdl2 2.0.14 is irrelevant, the user has 2.0.9
[22:28:07] <PMT> That's...not what you said.
[22:28:21] <SnoopJ> Okay, let's leave the version number aside, then.
[22:30:26] <SnoopJ> PMT, wait, what do you mean it's not what I said? I said they have libsdl2 2.0.9
[22:30:53] <PMT> SnoopJ: you said "their version numbers are different, so I think they're incompatible", then you said "the version number is irrelevant"
[22:30:59] <SnoopJ> I said 2.0.14 is
[22:31:03] <SnoopJ> The version number probably is not
[22:31:08] *** Joins: luuuciano_ (~luuuciano@user/luuuciano)
[22:31:37] <SnoopJ> Maybe we're saying the same thing. I think the user might have a libsdl2-ttf-2.0-0 that was build against a newer version of libsdl2 than what they have, and there's an ABI incompatibility problem.
[22:32:03] <SnoopJ> But it's just my best guess and I'm coming here to see what people who know more about Debian packaging think.
[22:33:01] <PMT> What version of Debian were they running?
[22:33:14] <SnoopJ> libsdl2-ttf 2.0.15 is 5 Jan 2019 as you say, and libsdl2 2.0.9 is 30 Oct 2018. It looks to me like the base library is older than the extension thingy.

[22:47:06] <SnoopJ> hmm, looking at the .so in that deb, it doesn't appear to want this symbol. https://bpa.st/7NJA I think that does it for my theory, thanks for the sanity check.
[22:48:50] <PMT> Yeah, that was also what I saw.
[22:49:40] <PMT> I believe Raspbian doesn't reuse debs even if they reuse source packages unmodified.
[22:49:45] <SnoopJ> Wonder where they're getting the symbol from. I know they used pip to install it and I believe they would've gotten a source build against system libsdl2. Oh well, if they come back we'll have to start afresh.
