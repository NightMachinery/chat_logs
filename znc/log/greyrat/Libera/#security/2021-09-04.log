[10:22:51] <catbeard> it's not about the amount of bits, it's about the KDF rounds and bitshifting to get to those bits, and additional entropy while generating the curve.  also, you can use ssh certificates with @ca-authority (i think) in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys if you're worried about unhandled revocation

[10:51:34] <catbeard> no i mean the 521 is just the bits it ends with, how many times it had to recurse into it's KDF is what gives it strenf.  like generating an ssh key with `-a #rounds`, the default is 16 iirc

[15:02:35] <wombawomba> When using the OAuth2 authorization code flow, is it fine to send the access token back to the user's browser, or would it be considered bad practice?
[15:03:10] <wombawomba> (i.e. the access token that my backend gets from the identity provider)
[15:03:38] <Apachez> how would otherwise the user identify each request?
[15:04:29] <wombawomba> Well, what I'm doing currently is exchanging that token for a token of my own (via Keycloak)
[15:04:32] <wombawomba> but I see your point
[15:04:40] <Apachez> another way is of course to proxy the request into a session based cookie string which you then map at your end
[15:04:53] <wombawomba> yeah that's what I was thinking
[15:05:07] <Apachez> but one of the points with oauth and similar is that the user runs around with the same ticket to all services
[15:05:23] <Apachez> and that would of course be broken if you do some midleproxying in between
[15:05:34] <wombawomba> the thing is I need to temporarily store the session token somewhere — currently I'm just putting it in Keycloak and calling it a day, but that doesn't work in this specific use-case
[15:06:13] <Apachez> as in user auth using oath2 or whatever but in return gets some session cookie which it use for following requests so the user never gets the actual strings sent by the backend but some random session string created by the midle server instead
[15:06:35] <wombawomba> so it's either 1. store it in my database and give the user a session cookie it can use to 'unlock' the stored token, or 2. just give the token back to the user directly as a cookie
[15:06:50] <Apachez> and when it comes to browser you apply the secure and httponly and proper domain string (as in NOT .com but rather subdomain.example.com."
[15:07:26] <wombawomba> yeah I'll keep the session/token in a properly secured cookie either way
[15:07:48] <wombawomba> tbh it seems easier to me to just pass the token back to the user
[15:08:07] <wombawomba> that way I don't have to worry about securely storing the token on my end

[15:14:15] <Apachez> there is probably some flowchart regarding this
[15:14:23] <Apachez> as I recall it you are supposed to do just that
[15:14:44] <Apachez> that is the auth server will generate a ticket and you will replicate it to the user and store it yourself to compare
[15:15:08] <Apachez> this way any requests afterwards dont need auth since your server receiving the request can verify the user on its own
[15:15:17] <Apachez> however such setup will be vuln to replay attacks

[15:18:19] <wombawomba> just do be clear, which of the approaches are you suggesting I take here?

[15:18:25] <secbot> ^ rfc6749
[15:18:46] <Apachez> short answer: I have no idea
[15:18:56] <Apachez> often ticket based systems are vuln to replay attacks
[15:19:03] <Apachez> as in if somebody gets hold of the ticket they are in
[15:19:34] <Apachez> but it also depends on how portable you want your clients to be
[15:19:52] <Apachez> assume a cell phone... not unlikely they get a new ip for every request (due to nating in cellnetworks)
[15:20:10] <Apachez> so on server end you cant really have the session id locked to an ip
[15:20:36] <Apachez> because next request would end up making the system think its an hacking attempt (proper ticket arrives from wrong ip)
[15:21:09] <wombawomba> tricky
[15:21:15] *** Quits: dev0 (~dev0@user/deepspace-link) ()
[15:21:20] <wombawomba> I'm not sure I would be vulnerable to replay attacks here though
[15:21:39] <Apachez> one workaround is of course to apply some subnetmasking lets say you allow the client to be moved for the last octet like /24  (lets say if the user had 10.1.2.3 as original ip you will allow the session to request from 10.1.2.x but on the other hand any spoofing is often likely to occur in the same subnet etc
[15:21:55] <wombawomba> I'd only read the request containing the token/session cookie once, and after that exchange it for a regular token on my realm via Keycloak
[15:22:00] <Apachez> so it depends on how portable you want the users to be
[15:22:11] <Apachez> the basics is not to filter on ip
[15:22:18] <Apachez> only on time and if the token is valid or not
[15:22:32] <wombawomba> so replaying the request where this token would be used wouldn't work
[15:22:52] <Apachez> like a user who logout will destroy the sessionid on serverside so if the sniffed sessionid shows up a few moments later its no longer valid and user is redirected to login page for example
[15:23:07] <wombawomba> yeah exactly
[15:23:22] <wombawomba> in this case _using_ the session/token once would destroy it
[15:23:23] <Apachez> another way is to create a new token for every request
[15:23:27] <Apachez> similar to challenge/response
[15:23:38] <Apachez> like first user login... the user receives token1
[15:23:52] <Apachez> next request will use token1.... the reply will overwrite sessionid with token2
[15:23:58] <Apachez> next request will use token2.... the reply will overwrite sessionid with token3...
[15:24:01] <wombawomba> (at least on my end — the identity provider would still consider the token valid)
[15:24:05] <Apachez> but that will put some heavy load on your db :P
[15:24:20] <wombawomba> yeah that sounds like a whole other can of worms
[15:24:24] *** Quits: apumax (~apumax@103.211.134.118) (Quit: Leaving)
[15:24:46] <Apachez> and if the request is sniffed and attacker sends request then the real user will be notified by being logged out perhaps to a specific login page warning the user that something is bogus
[15:25:32] <Apachez> "but doesnt https protect against this?" not necessary... depends on ssl termination and if the evil user already have a RAT on the victim computer they could still dump the ssl info needed
[15:25:48] <wombawomba> if I do end up going with a temporary session on my end (and store it appropriately), then since that session would only be valid for one request, and since I'm not exposing the auth token to users, then this should be reasonably secure
[15:25:48] <Apachez> so except for portability it also boils down to what you want to protect against
[15:26:39] <wombawomba> but if I pass the auth token back to the user, then someone with control to the user's browser could read my cookie, and use that to impersonate the user
[15:26:54] <wombawomba> ...which tbh still sounds like an acceptable level of security to me
[15:27:12] <Apachez> using https, setting session cookies using secure+httponly and proper domain string for the cookie will bring you a long way... and also use a unique token for each login attempt
[15:27:30] <Apachez> which is stored on server end to verify the request and when user logsout that session is destroyed
[15:27:56] <Apachez> also store a lastseen timestamp so unused tokens like older than 1 hour or whatever are purged from the server side invalidating the session
[15:28:30] <Apachez> and dont forget to use proper caching attributes so you dont run into the cache issue which klarna had a few months ago where customers suddently could act on other customers bankaccounts :P
[15:28:32] <Apachez> "oops"
[15:28:43] <wombawomba> hmm yeah
[15:28:52] <Apachez> there is probably some writeup on other things to consider on OWASP
[15:28:58] <Apachez> but the above should bring you far
[15:29:03] <Apachez> no matter which auth method you then use
[15:29:14] <wombawomba> IDK, I feel like not bothering with creating a session on my end and just passing the auth token via a cookie would be much easier not to mess up
[15:29:37] *** Quits: menace (~someone@ppp-93-104-165-2.dynamic.mnet-online.de) (Quit: menace)
[15:29:44] <Apachez> but if you pass the auth token, how do you verify next request?
[15:30:00] <Apachez> send that token all the way to your authserver (which probably will get unhappy)?
[15:30:22] <Apachez> often you only want to bother your authserver for the login itself, not the following requests where the user is already authed
[15:30:27] <wombawomba> hmm
[15:30:45] <wombawomba> yeah, the thing is that this is for user registration so I haven't created an account on my auth server yet
[15:31:08] <wombawomba> so I would just have to trust that the cookie hasn't been intercepted somehow
[15:31:23] <Apachez> personally I prefer to have some kind of human to approve new registrations if possible :P
[15:31:54] <wombawomba> hehe
[15:32:22] <wombawomba> I actually do have that as well currently, but I'll need to open up to self-registration eventually
[15:32:38] <Apachez> well the user can still fill out the form digitally
[15:32:58] <Apachez> just so you have a human at backend that clicks "everything ok" before it gets further into your systems
[15:33:07] <wombawomba> ah, yeah
[15:33:11] <wombawomba> that's sort of how it works now
[15:33:18] <Apachez> but again depends on the service etc :)
[15:33:24] <wombawomba> but again, I'll need to get rid of that
[15:33:40] <wombawomba> not a good way to scale :)
