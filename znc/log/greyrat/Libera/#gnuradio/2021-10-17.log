[00:33:06] <noc0lour_> schneider: isn't 10 MHz usually produced by the oscillator and this oscillator is disciplined with 1 PPS coming from the gps module?
[00:33:07] *** Joins: Vonter (~Vonter@user/vonter)
[00:37:36] <schneider> noc0lour_: sounds to me like you are talking about the *output* of a GPSDO
[00:37:45] *** Quits: Vonter (~Vonter@user/vonter) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[00:38:22] <schneider> what I'm interested in is the input (i.e. antenna connector) of a meinberg GPSDO though
[00:40:44] <schneider> noc0lour_: but thanks for asking. it made me lock for a block diagram of that thing
[00:40:45] <schneider> http://www.vikdhillon.staff.shef.ac.uk/ultracam/userman/gps170pex.pdf
[00:40:51] <schneider> page 8
[00:41:45] <schneider> it shows that the GPSDO sends a 10 MHz signal to the antenna
[00:43:19] *** Joins: Vonter (~Vonter@user/vonter)
[00:44:04] <noc0lour_> hm, it sends 10 MHz to the "IF-circuit"  
[00:44:10] <noc0lour_> and that sends LO to the antenna
[00:44:22] <schneider> (or at least some frequency. They call it "LO-frequency" but I assume it is 10 MHz and mutiplied by 154 in the antenna)
[00:47:47] *** Quits: Vonter (~Vonter@user/vonter) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[00:48:05] <noc0lour_> from the block diagram you see that they at least designed their system to work with quite a long cable
[00:48:54] <noc0lour_> https://www.meinbergglobal.com/download/docs/shortinfo/english/info_gpsant.pdf
[00:48:57] <noc0lour_> yep 10 MHz LO 
[00:49:45] <noc0lour_> looking around online it looks like other GPS antennas just send RF over their cable
[00:50:16] <noc0lour_> > this way a standard coaxial cable (e.g. RG58)  can be used for the connection with the GPS clock and a
[00:50:16] <noc0lour_> distance of up to 300 meters (with RG58) or even 700 meters (with a low-loss cable type like RG213)

[00:55:28] <schneider> noc0lour_: exactly
[00:55:57] <schneider> i knew that they were downconvertig the L1 signal, but I did not know how exactly

[01:07:31] <DavidLuttonM7DAL> DC and 10 MHz goes in to the antenna, to run a frequency locked 1540 MHz LO like https://www.minicircuits.com/pdfs/KSN-1850A-219+.pdf
[01:07:31] <DavidLuttonM7DAL> Which with active antenna and a mixer downconverts GPS at 1575.42 MHz to an IF centred at 35.4 MHz which comes back down the cable. 
[01:07:31] <DavidLuttonM7DAL> Really useful way to avoid cable losses, but makes the antenna end really expensive.

[18:51:20] <tonys[m]1> having struggled with HackRF One's half-duplex support and lack of rapid switching I was able to get a second one cheap. Is there a simple way in GRC to have the receiver device ignore anything transmitted from the other if i use the pair to provide full duplex, as the intention is to talk to a third device but now i'll need to avoid this feedback
[18:52:39] <Hoernchen> nö
[18:52:41] <Hoernchen> no
[18:53:46] <Macuser> cool I got gns-sdr working per tutorial
[18:53:48] <Hoernchen> you can obviously come up with some sort of synchronization so you know that what you received was just sent, but.. pfhh..
[18:53:49] <Macuser> gnss*
[19:04:37] <tonys[m]1> yeah i have messaging going on so I could set some kind of black out window to ignore them for some period after sending, just wasnt sure if such a thing already existing in GRC.
[19:04:37] <tonys[m]1> also could anyone advise on a safe distance between the units or other measures to avoid issues with using two units
[19:06:26] <Hoernchen> well only you know the details of your setup so look at the specs and calculate that

[20:42:01] <Jacob[m]12> @hash strange. is the PDU complex32 type?
[20:42:13] <Hash[m]> No, Byte
[20:42:38] <Hash[m]> Well, Byte saved to file.
[20:42:43] <patchvonbraun[m]> NVM. GRC cache bit me again.
[20:42:46] <Jacob[m]12> PDU to bursts requires the output type to be the same as the PDU type i believe
[20:43:39] <Hash[m]> It began life as complex32, PDU to tagged stream converts to byte then saves, should I leave it as Complex and write to file?
[20:43:59] <Jacob[m]12> hm
[20:44:30] <Jacob[m]12> i have not used tagged streams for some time, ill check on this tonight
[20:45:18] <Hash[m]> Thanks, i'll keep playing with it and see what I find. Trying to learn how to use PDU to Bursts to transmit so if you have any good example flowgraphs that would be helpful
[20:46:11] <Jacob[m]12> ping me here if you make progress, i should probably just stop ignoring TS... but god they are infuriating
[20:47:26] <Hash[m]> haha, i'm not married to TS in any way, just the first thing I tried :) 
[20:52:25] <Jacob[m]12> Yeah. There is certainly some good tooling within...
