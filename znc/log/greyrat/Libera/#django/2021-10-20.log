[09:12:01] <serafeim> hello friends
[09:22:45] *** Joins: carloratm (~carloratm@tilde.club)
[09:24:35] <carloratm> Hi all, I'd like to automatically append a unique numeric id to the slug field on a model. IIUC I can use both signals or override the save method? What do you recommend?
[09:25:09] <carloratm> s/both/either/
[09:26:10] <serafeim> override
[09:26:23] <serafeim> signals are to be avoided if there are other ways to do something
[09:28:53] <PaulWay[w]> Is this to avoid duplicates on a slug?
[09:30:22] <carloratm> serafeim: ok
[09:30:53] <carloratm> PaulWay[w]: yes, but allowing the textual part to be not unique
[09:31:38] <PaulWay[w]> So someone creates a thing, gives it a slug, and you want to assign it slug-2 or slug-3 if there's already a slug-1.
[09:32:33] <carloratm> correct.
[09:32:57] <serafeim> carloratm: i would recommend to not use counters but assign a random string instead like django does
[09:33:14] <serafeim> using counters leads to race conditions unless you are careful with table locking
[09:34:01] <carloratm> serafeim: ok, I was thinking at uuids but thery are too long I think.
[09:34:19] <serafeim> just a small random string should be nough
[09:34:23] <serafeim> enough
[09:35:28] <carloratm> but at every generation I have to check if the slug is unique in the database, right?
[09:36:26] <serafeim> no you woulnd't check. just add a unique constraint
[09:36:59] <serafeim> if you check you once again go to the race condition problem
[09:37:59] <carloratm> ok, with the constraint I just need to catch and retry in case of error
[09:38:10] <serafeim> i.e proc 1 generates a slug. proc 2 generates the same slug. proc 1 checks to see if slug exists and sees that it doesn't. proc 2 checks to see if slug exists and sees that it doesn't. proc 1 inserts the slug. proc 2 inserts the same slug. bummer
[09:38:44] <serafeim> carloratm: or you can just return an error i.e "Something fishy happend, try again". i mean how many unique slugs are you going to have ?
[09:40:04] <carloratm> it should really not happen. But a requirement is that the user does not have to put the slug manually, it must be all automatic.
[09:40:27] <serafeim> it will be automatic since the slug will be generated each time randomly
[09:40:45] <carloratm> anyway, the process is clear. Thank you
[09:40:50] <serafeim> cool

[13:31:35] <pycode> i am going crazy dealing with STATIC....ok i have DEBUG=True and STATIC_URL='/static/' i can see the static if i use DEBUG=True and STATIC_URL='http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/' it does NOT work!!! why?
[13:31:41] <pycode> the final url is just the same
[13:32:01] <pycode> i can reach, for exmaple: http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/quotes/img/email-logo.png
[13:32:11] <pycode> using first example
[13:32:46] <pycode> using the second (STATIC_URL='http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/') i see PAGE NOT FOUND
[13:32:50] <pycode> how is that possible?
[13:33:00] <pycode> the final url is just the same
[13:42:05] <moldy> pycode: if you set STATIC_URL to a full URL instead of a path, the static file serving for DEBUG mode is disabled
[13:42:07] <pycode> if the url... IS AN URL... it does not work
[13:42:24] <moldy> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/howto/static-files/#serving-static-files-in-development "This helper function works only in debug mode and only if the given prefix is local (e.g. /static/) and not a URL (e.g. http://static.example.com/)."
[13:42:40] <pycode> so what can i do? i mean... how can i test an email if that email need an url to show a logo ?
[13:43:38] <FunkyBob> tehre's a way you can ask request to build a full uri
[13:43:45] <moldy> IIRC: in the part of the code where you have access to the request, build the full URL using request.build_absolute_url(), then pass that URL to the email template
[13:44:04] <moldy> i think you can alternativel also do something with the sites framework
[13:44:20] <FunkyBob> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/request-response/#django.http.HttpRequest.build_absolute_uri
[13:44:27] <moldy> ah, uri not url :)
[13:46:24] <pycode> hmm i am not using the sites framework
[13:46:35] <pycode> and the problem still remain the same if i use a task (celery) or something else
[13:46:38] <pycode> i do not have the "request"
[13:46:40] <FunkyBob> no need to use sites
[13:46:51] <FunkyBob> pycode: how about you be up front with your requirements
[13:47:04] <FunkyBob> instead of dribbling them out to shoot down the solutions we provide
[13:48:21] <pycode> FunkyBob, i said that i do not have the sites framework reponding to moldy and... i do not have the "request" so i cannot do request.build_etcetc
[13:48:26] <moldy> pycode: the same principle applies with celery: build the URL where you have access to the request, then pass it on
[13:48:31] <pycode> i am not so good with dribbling :D
[13:48:47] <pycode> moldy, i can call task from a command too
[13:48:48] <FunkyBob> first you complain about sites, we fixed that
[13:48:53] <FunkyBob> then you mentioned emails... so we fixed that
[13:48:56] <FunkyBob> then you mention using celeryt
[13:49:05] <FunkyBob> so yes, you're dribbling out the details
[13:49:15] <moldy> pycode: if there is no request there is no URL, so in that case all you can do is fall back to some default
[13:49:26] <pycode> FunkyBob, never mentioned sites, i just replied to moldy ... however
[13:49:28] <pycode> yes moldy
[13:49:39] <pycode> i think i must add a variable on settings.py
[13:49:49] <moldy> that would be one option, yes
[13:49:49] <FunkyBob> nobody fucking well talking about sites
[13:50:02] <pycode> FunkyBob, >>> <moldy> i think you can alternativel also do something with the sites framework
[13:50:13] <FunkyBob> yes, he mentioned it, I said you don't need it... move on
[13:50:19] <FunkyBob> you're the one who keeps going back to it
[13:50:28] <FunkyBob> but I'm wondering WHAT OTHER requirements you haven't mentioned yet
[13:51:37] <FunkyBob> if you'd come out up front and said "I'm trying to send emails from celery tasks, but I need to put full URIs into them"...
[13:51:40] <pycode> FunkyBob, i need to deal with "statics" from normal pages (normal requests) AND....from commands that have no request. I mentioned email because i send email through commands too
[13:51:43] <FunkyBob> we could have skipped a lot
[13:52:09] <pycode> ok
[13:52:11] <FunkyBob> if you want external references, something needs to know the external URL
[13:52:50] <pycode> is there a way i can read settings from template? or i need to inject that var for every template i need ?
[13:52:53] <moldy> an extra setting should work, or maybe use ALLOWED_HOSTS[0] or whatever
[13:53:14] <moldy> a context processor is an easy way to inject variables into all templates
[13:53:20] <FunkyBob> you could use a context processor to add the value for all templates
[13:53:44] <pycode> intersting, yes because i need them everywhere...BUT...are the context_processor used with commands too ?
[13:54:03] <pycode> if yes i can expose some general var that i need everywhere
[13:54:27] <moldy> by command, do you mean management command?
[13:54:28] <FunkyBob> but why would you need the hostname in normal requests?
[13:56:11] <pycode> moldy, yes
[13:56:40] <moldy> pycode: management commands are just python, so you can access the settings with `from django.conf import settings`
[13:57:09] <pycode> yes moldy but what i am saying is that i read template from commands too (for emails)
[13:57:33] <pycode> so i am asking if i must adding the hostname everywhere or i can put it in context_processor and use them in the templates without adding that variables
[13:58:10] <moldy> i am not 100% sure, but i think context processors do not run if the template is rendered without a request
[13:58:12] <pycode> i need to show the logo everywhere so if i have 10 commands that send 10 emails i am saying if i have to add that var 10 times or just use a context_processor to expose the global vars i need
[13:58:23] <pycode> moldy, ok
[13:58:26] <moldy> so in the management command, just populate the template context yourself
[13:58:34] <pycode> i will pass the var, it is not a big problem, just asking
[13:58:35] <pycode> ok
[13:58:39] <pycode> thanks
[13:59:14] <pycode> moldy, i am using celery for many tasks
[13:59:24] <pycode> and 90% of times a task...ends with an email
[13:59:31] <pycode> the tasks have no "request"
[13:59:37] <pycode> so it is just the same thing as command right?
[13:59:57] <moldy> pass everything the task needs to the task as arguments
[13:59:59] <pycode> i must inject the settings into the template (not all the settings ..sure) just the things i need
[14:00:25] <pycode> moldy, so do you think i must pass the uri to the task directly?
[14:00:35] <pycode> maybe is more "easy" to load the settings and get the variable from there
[14:01:16] <moldy> either approach should work, i think
[14:01:56] <pycode> ok
[14:02:02] <pycode> thanks
[14:04:08] <pycode> moldy, i am thinking to override render_to_string to inject the global varis i need directly inside that functions instead of passing "base_url": BASE_URL etc
[14:04:12] <pycode> sounds stupid ?
[14:04:59] <moldy> sounds ok to me
[14:05:33] <moldy> i'd probably do this though: ``render_to_string(template_name, context=get_default_context())``
[14:06:06] <pycode> i mean def render_to_string(path, vars): return real_render_to_string(path, vars+my_global_var)
[14:06:07] <pycode> oh
[14:06:15] <pycode> so that way django will load all the context_processors?
[14:06:29] <moldy> then you can also do ``context=get_default_context(); context.update({"foo": "bar"}); render_to_string(template_name, context)``

[14:08:27] <pycode> ok

[14:09:19] <pycode> ok

[14:49:39] <pycode> or just different port ?
[14:49:49] <moldy> i usually just use localhost:8000

[15:12:49] <dang`r`us> depends on the library
[15:13:26] <dang`r`us> if it gives you 'all instances that are not unique', you need to subtract 'instances that are' from that
