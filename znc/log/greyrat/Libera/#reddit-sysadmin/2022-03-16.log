[02:04:21] <PattyCakes> then I'm in it for the land cost Hunterkll 
[02:04:30] <PattyCakes> and if I have to exit, the loss is minimal if nothing
[02:04:39] <Bogdaniel> well I got a server with a raid1 setup two ssds, my /dev/sda3 and /dev/sdb3 are 414.1G each, what I would like to do would be to shrink them and create one more partition to use as a zfs pool. I tried following a tutorial I found on google but failed dramatically:D
[02:04:53] <Hunterkll> well, that was your first mistake
[02:05:02] <Hunterkll> actually
[02:05:06] <Hunterkll> everything here was a mistake
[02:05:09] <PattyCakes> ^
[02:05:15] <rpifan> tak
[02:05:21] <Bogdaniel> Never worked with a raid before and I'm a bit confused
[02:05:32] <Hunterkll> well, given you're referring to partitions
[02:05:38] <Hunterkll> we're looking at mdadm software raid
[02:05:43] <Bogdaniel> yes
[02:05:52] <yuken> Oh my god Hunterkll. Shaquille O'Neal's chip
[02:05:53] <yuken> is so good.
[02:05:58] <yuken> wait
[02:05:58] <Hunterkll> just use the server's hardware raid 
[02:06:01] <yuken> not Shaq, Lebron James
[02:06:05] <Hunterkll> unless it's a leased host and you can't
[02:06:06] <Hunterkll> but
[02:06:10] <yuken> I knew it was a basketball player
[02:06:12] <Hunterkll> what's the driver to use ZFS ?
[02:06:15] <Bogdaniel> it's a dedicated from hetzner ..:D
[02:06:17] <Hunterkll> like, why a zpool?
[02:06:26] <Hunterkll> Bogdaniel: my OVH servers all have hardware raid ;)
[02:06:33] <Bogdaniel> for docker storage.
[02:06:48] <Hunterkll> Ah, and is docker explicitly requiring ZFS for this?
[02:06:54] <mistiry> PattyCakes: 3mil and in fucking Katy LOL
[02:07:07] <mistiry> goddamn market is insane 
[02:07:11] <Hunterkll> I know it's not, but what specifically does ZFS buy you that you don't have right now?
[02:07:22] <Bogdaniel> doesn't explicitly requires zfs
[02:07:36] <PattyCakes> mistiry like I said, 1.75m we can talk
[02:07:44] <Hunterkll> ZFS on linux is... interesting
[02:07:44] <PattyCakes> 3? BWHAHAhaha no
[02:08:01] <mistiry> "but we're kinda close to Houston!"
[02:08:10] <PattyCakes> like I just laughed when the broker called
[02:08:42] <PattyCakes> "we'r ready to execute on your finacing"
[02:08:43] <Hunterkll> Bogdaniel: well, the real question is - what do you hope to gain with ZFS that you don't have now?
[02:08:50] <PattyCakes> bitch, no we ain't
[02:08:59] <mistiry> that is the right answer
[02:09:01] <mistiry> fuck that lol
[02:09:08] <Bogdaniel> Hunterkll I'm hoping to get more performance
[02:09:32] <Hunterkll> Bogdaniel: well, you *can* get that with ZFS, if you have a caching tier and a fair amount of free ram
[02:09:33] <PattyCakes> "How would you like to provide your deposit?"
[02:09:44] <PattyCakes> "UHH, I didn't even give you a verbal offer. Hop off"
[02:10:12] <Hunterkll> Bogdaniel: spinning rust or SSDs?
[02:10:16] <Bogdaniel> ssds
[02:11:27] <Hunterkll> Bogdaniel: so, performance wise, your best options are to stick with the md array on linux if you can't do HW raid (or even "faikraid" in the bios)
[02:11:46] <Hunterkll> unless you want to burn ~10GB ram 
[02:12:07] <Hunterkll> but, if you still want to go down that path
[02:12:14] <Hunterkll> maybe just to test, who knows?
[02:12:26] <Hunterkll> you need to fix your bootloader to boot your system after *breaking* your MD array 
[02:12:51] <Hunterkll> basically, toss the MD array, nuke the second disk, resize on first, then replicate changes back
[02:13:07] <Bogdaniel> Hunterkll hah that part with the bootloader I didn't do it. and burning 10GB it's not that much but erm I would keep it for actual work:D
[02:13:35] <Hunterkll> right, bootloader is loading off disk, but then kernel parms/mount options are expecting an MD after the initrd loads
[02:13:59] <Hunterkll> so you need to fix that to properly "break" the array 
[02:14:21] <Hunterkll> so i imagine grub probably has a root= line
[02:14:43] <Hunterkll> you need to change that to root=/dev/sda3 instead of the mount it has, which might be an MD, might not, might be a UUID, etc
[02:14:56] <Hunterkll> assuming /dev/sda3 is your / partition, of course
[02:15:08] <Bogdaniel> yes /sda3 is the / partition:D
[02:15:59] <Hunterkll> so you'd need /dev/sda3 to be the root= (if there is one) and *break* the MD array
[02:16:11] <Hunterkll> like, unload and blacklist the module, delete the config, etc
[02:16:17] <sd> 06<d​Mupp3t> Just gotta reverse the polarity.
[02:16:28] <Bogdaniel> anyway the whole idea started from GlusterFS then went on the idea with Ceph but requires at least 3 nodes and in the end the stupid idea with zfs:D
[02:16:50] <Hunterkll> well
[02:16:57] <Hunterkll> long story short, in a single server scenario
[02:17:00] <Hunterkll> it won't buy you anything
[02:17:07] <Hunterkll> so .... just enjoy docker and move on :)
[02:17:11] <PattyCakes> mistiry how about 18 units for 3.5nm in uhhhh Reno
[02:17:24] <Bogdaniel> Yeah for the moment is just a single server scenario won't be adding anytime soon another server or two servers

[02:17:54] <PattyCakes> https://www.crexi.com/comps/C53445758
[02:19:12] <Hunterkll> Bogdaniel: yea, ZFS is amazing, but for your use case, it buys you nothing but more admin overhead/time and no real benefits but increased ram usage
[02:24:18] <Bogdaniel> Hunterkll Sure i'll keep it for the moment as it is.
[02:25:14] <Hunterkll> Bogdaniel: also, you can get RAID-10 SSDs with IP space and vrack for like 200eur/mo at OVH :)

[07:44:20] <e1> ns12, a couple of places I have worked have seen previous admins route that mail to the sysadmin, however I have never found them informative compared to logging and metrics
[07:47:24] <JollyRgrs> weird thing to ask... trying to replicate an issue where a machine does not resolve a specific fqdn. In trying to test this, I want my machine to also "not resolve"... but hosts file (windows) requires an IP so it'll still resolve to 127.0.0.1 or whatever I fill it with... it won't be the same as literally not resolving the hostname
[07:47:40] <JollyRgrs> how to test aside from testing by giving it an invalid hostname completely
[07:48:28] <e1> i think that depends what you're testing tbh
[07:48:53] <e1> Like if you want to see what a browser does when a domain name doesn't resolve, you just enter googlehasasmallpenis.cum
[07:50:00] <JollyRgrs> PS script
[07:50:31] <JollyRgrs> I was using a variable for the dns name in a few places. I'll just swap it out during testing I guess and manually give it a non-existant domain name

[15:07:37] <kerat58> got a situation, there's a docker-compose for a series of apps, each one uses a different image.  Works great for non-debug workloads
[15:07:48] <kerat58> the image is a ready to go docker build of the app in question
[15:08:49] <kerat58> but we want another version of that same compose for debug builds, basically, intead of using an image, it would execute a build at the time of the compose, so every time you run it, you get the bleeding edge stuff, not just the versions of each app whose image is uploaded to dockerhub
[15:09:17] <kerat58> is there a way to do this wihtout having a completely separate docker-compose file?  or we basically need two separate composes?
[15:10:26] <thegodsquirrel> I have a basic knowledge of DC, but when I need a "different" version of an image I use tags to pull another version other that :latest.  DC defaults to latest with no tag.

[15:14:31] <kerat58> well a tag of the image isn't going to work, I don't think, because the image would be a versioned docker build of app X.
[15:14:48] <kerat58> Unless we re-run that dockerfile on the spot 
[15:15:16] <kerat58> So is there a way to do the `build` part of DC only conditionally; and do the `image` part (e..g use a ready to go image) in other cases?

[15:15:43] <kerat58> We do
[15:17:04] <kerat58> for debug builds there may be a series of changes (done on the developer's machine) rapidly, so it'd be a pain to manually build -> re-tag the build just so that we can re-run compose on the developer's machine

[15:32:19] <kerat58> success rate?
[15:35:51] <thegodsquirrel> You said you would like to do this without having the change the yaml every time? kerat58 
[15:36:15] <CombatVet> i wonder if those old school IRC bouncers still exist, where it disconnects when you disconnect, not like ZNC that stays running
[15:37:17] <monr0e> kerat58: Every time I've ordered on AliExpress thus far, I've gotten exactly what I wanted, in the precise quality that was advertised, with no more hassle than the wait time
[15:37:38] <monr0e> Amazon has been very hit&miss
[15:38:20] <kerat58> Interesting.
[15:38:29] <kerat58> thegodsquirrel:  Ideally yes ;)
[15:38:55] <PattyCakes> monr0e, I ordered 1000 pencils on amazon and maybe 80% were shit. I ordered a fucking pallet of pencils from Alibaba - probably the nicest writing sticks ever
[15:39:07] <PattyCakes> amazon is purely targeted at the lowest price per customer
[15:39:11] <PattyCakes> and it pisses me the fuck off
[15:39:15] <kerat58> thegodsquirrel:  So, the idea is to avoid having two compose files.  Developers could use the compose in their machines as part of the "devcontainer" visual studio extension.  And then the same compose could be used for production.  But production version would use images, not on-the-spot builds.
[15:39:23] <bomb> PattyCakes oh man Alibaba is a goldmine
[15:39:41] <kerat58> I have personally never tried Alibaba but will now
[15:39:47] <thegodsquirrel> It looks like you _can_ do conditional statements in the yaml, but I just use DC for homeprod lab stuff, so I am out of my depth here
[15:40:12] <PattyCakes> and yes, for those curious - a fucking PALLET of pencils. The local school district was confused when I rolled up and was like "I only need like 3 cases, you guys want the rest?"

[15:40:18] <PattyCakes> boom tax deductible donation
[15:41:16] <thegodsquirrel> You might have to do environment variables with env file and some other voodoo in the yaml file.
[15:42:24] <hunterkll> i've put in my packet
[15:42:26] <hunterkll> :D
[15:42:45] <kerat58> Right.
[15:42:55] <kerat58> OK, I'll poke around more.  
[15:43:17] <hunterkll> dreding up my old paperwork was...... fun
[15:43:35] <kerat58> This all started thanks to vscode and the devcontainer extension.  You can use a docker compose definition to create a "dev container" for developres to do their code in.
[15:43:58] <kerat58> So, when they hit 'compile' it runs in the container, not in the local box.  VScode does tings to make it seem seamless including command line redirects
[15:44:13] <kerat58> That got me thinking - if we have this docker compose, we may try using it in prod too
[15:44:30] <kerat58> to deploy this particular suite of apps in this particular order.  Thereby, allowing the coveted "dev matches prod" scenario
[15:46:06] <thegodsquirrel> Yeah, I am not sure how much DC is used for prod deploying, that vscode extension seems pretty nifty
[15:47:49] <bomb> what is DC, if I might to ask?
[15:47:58] <kerat58> docker compose
[15:48:11] <kerat58> It does work wonders for dev environments at the very least
[15:48:45] <bomb> ah
[15:49:04] <bomb> yeah it's a godsend for dev
[15:49:15] <thegodsquirrel> sorry about the confusing abbrev. 
[15:49:38] <thegodsquirrel> "Who deploys from a domain controller?!?"
[15:49:40] <kerat58> i think we may do something nifty here
[15:49:46] <kerat58> this idea just occurred to me
[15:50:28] <thegodsquirrel> https://docs.docker.com/compose/production/
[15:50:32] <kerat58> A.  Continue using docker-compose for dev.  B. Perhaps re-use that docker compose script on a build server to make tagged images of each app.  Push the images to the private registry.  C.  Use something like Tower to deploy into prod using the images

[21:40:14] <CableNinja> can someone confirm for me that I am not just being an 'anti-docker' dick.... coworker things that using docker as a privileged container to exeucte and do things on the hypervisor is a good idea. Its absolutely the worst idea right? why would you even ever do or allow such a thing. if the thing has to make modifications to the system running the hypervisor, why even put it in the container, you're just mucking up resources for docker
[21:41:02] <int0x1C8> its certainly not ideal, but I had to do it for one of my containerized components
[21:41:09] <CableNinja> "had to do it"
[21:41:13] <CableNinja> not "wanted to do it"
[21:41:20] <CableNinja> or "wanted to make it for a customer application"
[21:41:38] <CableNinja> so... yeah... I'm not being a docker dick...
[21:42:06] <int0x1C8> it's an API that calls another docker container as an executable, so needs access to the docker socket
[21:42:23] <Kiernian> yeah, LOL, that's "had to".
[21:42:35] <CableNinja> ok, I'm talking about for example, making filesystems and users and such on the system running the docker container

[21:42:53] <CableNinja> thats stupid right?

[21:43:38] <PublicWifi> I'd rather hold it
[21:43:44] <PublicWifi> I perform better under pressure ;D
[21:43:51] <Kiernian> I feel like one of the main points of having a container is for the "sandboxed" portion of things. If it's not that or for the "running something with as few resources/dependencies accessible as possible" portion, it's probably a good idea to question why you want a container
[21:44:48] <Kiernian> if the container is going to have rights/access to do shit on the hypervisor anyway, why not put whatever you're putting in the container directly onto the hypervisor?
[21:44:51] <CableNinja> Kiernian, right... so my point stands... why would you even consider a docker container if you're manipulating the system that'd be running it
[21:44:55] <CableNinja> yep
[21:44:57] <CableNinja> thats my point
[21:45:04] <CableNinja> ok so NTA
[21:45:20] <Kiernian> I wouldn't think so, no.
[21:45:34] <int0x1C8> it could be for organizational reasons?
[21:45:44] <CableNinja> its not

[22:56:54] <sd> 14<K​illnine> Sage doesn't really use that much bandwidth, so teaming probably doesn't matter. Maybe just if a port goes bad?

[22:57:56] <sd> 06<d​Mupp3t> Yeah I could see having 2 connected for redundancy, but if that were the case they should be going to separate switches lol.
[22:58:00] <sd> 14<K​illnine> The server we run Sage on has 2 ethernet ports. I was thinking about how to do that. Whether we want to just use one or put each on different switches
[22:58:06] <sd> 14<K​illnine> Yeah, @jameslovesbeer
[22:58:25] <vinrock> killnine you need to configure lacp on the switch port if you are doing a bonded link
[22:58:32] <vinrock> otherwise just one to each different switch
[22:59:06] <sd> 14<K​illnine> I was thinking the latter. Again, bandwidth isn'
[22:59:10] <sd> 14<K​illnine> t realy an issue with Sage

[23:10:58] <DrGibby> upsidedown jokes are my go-to
[23:11:02] <PublicWifi> thing is I don't know the firs tthing about enterprise level DR or backups lmfao

[23:11:41] <CableNinja> biggest rule of backups: 2 is one, and 1 is none

[23:11:44] <csws> was pretty cool
[23:11:48] <CableNinja> rule of 3s
[23:11:56] <PublicWifi> yeah I know the basics

[23:12:23] <PublicWifi> not IBM shit
[23:12:38] <DrGibby> meh, the concepts scale up
[23:12:38] <CableNinja> you know what..
[23:12:39] <PublicWifi> its true
[23:12:42] <DrGibby> chicken butt
[23:12:45] <PublicWifi> I need to stop being a little bitch
[23:12:52] <CableNinja> I bet the cost to drill the billion holes for the mac speakers is probably a ridiculous amount
[23:12:56] <PublicWifi> and take my own advice :D
[23:13:07] <DrGibby> are we sure they're drilled? 
[23:13:12] <CableNinja> they have to be
[23:13:21] <PublicWifi> call AvE and ask him
[23:13:25] <DrGibby> ^
[23:13:32] <csws> probably got a machine that punches them out all at once
[23:13:40] <CableNinja> no way
[23:13:57] <CableNinja> thats hard to believe given the size
[23:14:14] <DrGibby> cast?
[23:14:18] <csws> I searched "how are speaker grilles made" and got NOTHING useful
[23:14:20] <csws> the internet sucks
[23:14:22] <CableNinja> way too small for cast
[23:14:39] <vinrock> holy shit its nice outside
[23:14:43] <CableNinja> the're like .25mm or less
[23:14:45] <csws> >9pm
[23:14:49] <csws> I mean if that floats your boat I guess
[23:14:56] <DrGibby> I suspect when you arm a bunch of cheap labor with a few dewalts, shit can get done quickly 
[23:15:04] <vinrock> whos trying to make speakers grills
[23:15:06] <vinrock> theyre easy
[23:15:08] <csws> yeah but then it'd have obvious defects
[23:15:19] <vinrock> you make the frame out of MDF and then stretch fabric on it
[23:16:04] <csws> guess he means this kinda thing? https://icdn5.digitaltrends.com/image/apple-macbook-gold-2015-speaker-grill-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg
[23:20:21] <CableNinja> vinrock, I'm talking about the macbook speaker grille
[23:20:36] <CableNinja> I was saying I bet its expensive as fuck given the number of holes and size to be drilled
[23:21:02] <CableNinja> csws, the ones on mine are smaller than that I think?
[23:21:33] <CableNinja> https://store.storeimages.cdn-apple.com/4982/as-images.apple.com/is/refurb-mbp16touch-silver-gallery-2019?wid=2000&hei=2000&fmt=jpeg&qlt=80&.v=1582233083340
[23:21:58] <PublicWifi> DrGibby: you'd be surprised what some rednecks can do with a few dewalts and some duct tape
[23:22:00] <CableNinja> bad image, but left and right size, its like 32x128 tiny tiny tiny holes on each side
[23:22:57] <DrGibby> PublicWifi: I'm aware lol
[23:23:01] <CableNinja> its gotta be a CNC drill, I couldnt see a way of that being a press or anything like that without being really inaccurate
[23:23:04] <vinrock> ah
[23:23:18] <vinrock> im leaning towards a die press
[23:23:31] <bomb> I wish I was a CNC operator. I could build many little stuff and sell online
[23:23:32] <vinrock> and the dies are probably epensive af and wear out quickly
[23:23:35] <CableNinja> they'd have to swap the die out like every 5 stamps
[23:23:38] <vinrock> yep
[23:23:46] <CableNinja> thats why I dont think they use stamping
[23:23:52] <CableNinja> too much room for error
[23:24:02] <vinrock> cnc id imagine would be too slow when you add up all the repositioning
[23:24:10] <vinrock> bzzt, move, bzzt, move
[23:24:12] <CableNinja> could maybe be a multi head
[23:24:24] <CableNinja> doing a few at a time
[23:24:44] <CableNinja> its not thick metal so it wouldnt take 'that' long to do a single hole
[23:24:47] <DrGibby> I'd put $5 that its not CNC 
[23:25:38] <DrGibby> will donate to St Jude if proven wrong

[23:27:10] <vinrock> its a laser
[23:27:27] <vinrock> its just swinging side to side burning out the holes
[23:27:29] <CableNinja> I guess that also makes sense, easy to make tiny precision holes with a laser
[23:27:38] <DrGibby> bzzzzzt
