[00:02:01] <thunder> for me the "without-adjectives" adjective ;) means that everyone should in theory be able to gravitate/migrate to the community of their choosing, regardless of it's political or economic conditions. with the caveat that coercion is elicit and will be met with force as necessary. there will always be those willing to coerce, so society must accept that as a fact and prepare accordingly.
[00:02:32] <thunder> by society, I mean individuals
[00:02:51] <apotheon> on the way to panarchism
[00:03:05] <apotheon> Everything seems to head in that direction.
[00:03:12] <apotheon> It feels inevitable.
[00:03:40] <thunder> if you take the non-coercion thing to an extreme though, you may have issues raising children.
[00:04:28] <thunder> it's as though they are a special class of person with only limited access to rights until a socially recognized point of transition to adulthood

[00:04:46] <apotheon> Depending on how much of an extreme, it might not be any worse than poorly managed coercive parenting.
[00:05:09] <thunder> true. there are indigenous societies which function that way.
[00:05:23] <apotheon> Rather than social recognition, I'd think some kind of responsible-thinking capacity test is appropriate.
[00:06:03] <apotheon> Consider children to be subject to parental control until two things occur:
[00:06:15] <thunder> by social recognition I mean like an age of majority, where it becomes socially taboo for parents to abrogate the child's rights
[00:06:16] <apotheon> 1. the child wants to be emancipated
[00:06:30] <mwsb> audrey: sorry I was asleep! Of course you can pm me
[00:06:43] <apotheon> 2. the parents fail to demonstrate the child's capacity for responsible decision making capabilities
[00:07:05] <apotheon> A magic number is pretty much never the right answer.
[00:07:59] <apotheon> Magic numbers destroy the idea of being innocent until proven guilty of rights violations.
[00:08:38] <thunder> speculating about indigenous societies which do not coerce their children, I think to some extent it's realistic and responsible parenting. if you think about it, the role of the parent is to prepare the child to accept full responsibility for their own actions and consequences. what better way to instill that than to allow the child to feel those consequences directly? then the child is posed with their own decision as to whether to persist
[00:08:38] <thunder> independently or to seek guidance.
[00:09:44] <thunder> I agree about magic numbers. but even recently that issue came up in respect to rms and comments he'd previously made about the age of consent. it caused quite a row because of the social taboos involved
[00:11:51] <apotheon> RMS is socially incompetent, and this was the outcome of that.

[00:26:27] <thunder> I agree with quite a lot of what rms has to say, especially on tech subjects. but where we differ is his attitude towards taxation, which I view as inherently extortionary and coercive, and one of the prime foundations for the perpetuation of that pattern in society at large.

[01:09:23] <Varde> Is consciousness Quiddity? Seems a round about term for a more precise subject. Alertness and awareness of, is a facet of that subject, not all of it.
[01:10:15] <Varde> I use the term spirit in a non theological context, referring to the aliveness and vivacity.

[01:11:49] <Varde> Hi urishgirl!
[01:12:07] <Varde> You having a good night/day?
[01:12:38] <urishgirl> Yes.
[01:15:35] <Varde> You can't be intellectual about a subject unless you know that subject concisely. if not, then attempting to be intellectual will result in failure. Which adds to the topic; if we refer to the spirit as consciousness, a Quiddity, then it isn't a concise term. Further, can we even be precise and be concise, or is the subject matter to strange(i.e consc cannot be known, only understood by facets; like nature).

[03:37:38] <thunder> oh. I'm not extremely well versed in psychology/psychanalysis nomenclature. my understanding of the subconscious is that it's the train of thought just beneath the surface of consciousness which we can access via attention. like if you were talking to a friend and were interrupted, but the conversation is still running under the surface until you focus attention on it again and pick up where you left off.
[03:38:35] <thunder> there's another element which is the unconscious mind, a sort of storehouse of disassociated symbols and various fluid emotional dynamics which interact with them
[03:38:57] <Varde> However I don't see how that refutes my point about not forgetting to goto the shop because you still have it in memory. It was more a lack of skill with memory, perhaps in the example scenario the thinker was distracted.
[03:40:57] <thunder> I'm just saying that separating memory and the brain maybe erroneous. moreover if you aren't a neurosurgeon you can only speak of brains based on hearsay. the most accessible evidence for the nature of consciousness comes from the experience of it directly (ie. gnosis). fwiw, that's why I limit my own system to the first-person perspective of consciousness.
[03:41:37] <Varde> You seem to have dodged my point, but don't worry I'll read what you're just saying instead.
[03:41:44] <thunder> neurosurgery is interesting and insightful, but I have to take someone else's word for it
[03:41:53] <Varde> Ok thanks.
[03:43:28] <thunder> yeah. I guess body/psyche could be recharacterized as brain/mind in this specific context. but I don't really know anything to speak of about how the brain works, so I just speak of the body (which I can experience) as the vessel/instrument of consciousness

[03:53:12] <thunder> Varde: I think in this context they can be equivalent. the word body isn't limited to the body identified as self. it can be other bodies also. in a more abstract sense it's form/force which provide substance/change of which to be aware
[03:53:32] <Varde> Agreed.
[03:53:53] <Varde> We may not be what we are sensed to be...
[03:54:21] <thunder> like if you conceive of consciousness as a force, such as the acts of comparison and choice, while the sensible difference and similarity making those possible are the form
[03:54:43] <thunder> in that sense form/force is analogous to body/psyche or brain/mind

[05:23:45] <Varde> On the topic of aid
[05:24:11] <Varde> Is Phenomenology a/the most common gateway to philosophy?
[05:25:01] <Varde> Philosophy can be thought of as medicine to the Phenomenologist, who is left muddled by the questions regarding experience and spirit.

[05:57:54] * Varde clusps onto reality
[05:58:05] <apotheon> Varde: It's kinda amazing how many people think they have the questions of phenomenology solved.
[05:58:44] <Varde> Yeah I agree, I for one know consciousness can't be known concisely - if at all.
[05:58:56] <Varde> CEMI is incorrect.
[05:59:33] <Varde> We can understand facets of it. Like we can understand facets of nature but never know what nature is concisely. What is nature?
[06:00:23] <apotheon> How do you know CEMI field theory is incorrect?
[06:01:00] <Varde> I know consciousness can't be known.
[06:01:20] <Varde> Like nature, as I put it.
[06:01:38] <Varde> Understanding consciousness and nature is possible...
[06:01:49] <Varde> Ask what they are though and you'll point to facets
[06:02:28] <Varde> I doubt CEMI. I don't *know* it's wrong unless what I know about consciousness is enough of proof to reject it.
[06:04:05] <apotheon> Okay, that's fair.
[06:04:30] <apotheon> I'd take CEMI field theory over a lot of the strictly neurological theories of consciousness.
[06:04:41] <Varde> Cool.
[06:05:21] <apotheon> I find myself wondering sometimes if people buying into the strictly neurological theories are philosophical zombies, because they seem inclined to reject the possibiilty that there's any such thing as an internal qualitative experience.
[06:05:43] <Varde> Yeah exactly.
[06:06:03] <Varde> It's all gotta be communicable and shorthand is acceptable, etc.
[06:06:10] *** Quits: mrdata (~mrdata@user/mrdata) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[06:06:10] <apotheon> Given an internal qualitative experience -- which I know first-hand -- I'd take Descartes' immaterial substance ideas over the strictly neurological theories.
[06:06:50] <Varde> 'cause we experience similar lives it should be possible to communicate some round about information and it be the answer/knowledge'. nope.
[06:08:18] <apotheon> I've met people who argue that someone else has not experienced qualia, as if the person so arguing can somehow know that someone else didn't experience something.
[06:08:47] <Varde> Lol
[06:08:53] *** Quits: Brainium (~brainium@user/brainium) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[06:08:57] <Varde> Yeah people are stooopie.
[06:08:57] <apotheon> It comes off like an argument that "I am a soulless, organic robot, so you are also a soulless, organic robot."
[06:09:28] <apotheon> It makes me wonder if half the population is actually made up of non-qualitative entities.
[06:09:29] <Varde> Yeah some people still think animals don't have spirits
[06:09:44] <Varde> Nah, most people have 8 consciousnesses
[06:10:04] <apotheon> I'm not even sure humans have "spirits", depending on your definition of "spirit", but they definitely have something a robot does not have.
[06:10:05] <Varde> Joking
[06:10:25] <Varde> I think consciousness is too round about a term.
[06:10:40] <Varde> Therefore I opt for spirit over a new term so it's communicable.
[06:10:45] <apotheon> Whatever that is, it argues for an existence that is not strictly materialistic in the way science understands "material".
[06:11:04] <apotheon> Yeah, I can understand that usage.
[06:11:15] <Varde> Awareness and alertness of, is one facet of the spirit
[06:11:22] <apotheon> Spirit's a good term for it, if you make sure everyone in the conversation is using the same definition.
[06:11:36] <Varde> I'm conscious through the spirit, body and brain.
[06:11:47] <Varde> Yeah
[06:11:55] <apotheon> I try to focus on the one clear aspect that I know exists, that seems lacking in (for instance) bauxite: qualitative experience.
[06:12:20] <apotheon> Combine that with the capacity for ethical reasoning, and you've got something special.
[06:12:24] <Varde> Yeah that's a decent one.
[06:12:29] <Varde> I'll use that from now on.
[06:12:42] <apotheon> coolio
[06:12:47] <apotheon> someone liked my thinking
[06:13:02] <Varde> Haha
[06:13:15] <Varde> Here's a good question
[06:13:33] <Varde> Are elements personal? If we all look at the sea, each of our senses of water is unique, whereas the sea is not.
[06:13:37] <apotheon> The big problem so far with basing this kind of thing on qualitative experience is that I have no way to detect with certainty that some other entity does or does not experience qualia.
[06:14:21] <apotheon> Yeah, assuming the sea is a thing at all, the experience of it could be unrecognizably different between people.
[06:14:55] <Varde> Yep, though elements are always unique is my point - no could be about it.
[06:14:58] <Varde> The sea is not
[06:15:06] <Varde> The sea can be the same/similar
[06:15:09] <apotheon> (there's always the "brain in a jar" thought experiment, though actually believing that's the case about one's existence, and acting in accord with certainty, is deeply dangerous)
[06:15:33] <Varde> That's a cool story apotheon
[06:15:38] <Varde> Thought provoking
[06:16:22] <apotheon> Have you read René Descartes' cogito?
[06:16:46] <Varde> I experience qualia mate. I have a vision of the birds in the sky, like stripes in the sky, flapping, often black or white coloured
[06:16:56] <Varde> No.
[06:18:13] <apotheon> Meditations on First Philosophy is his work on establishing the existence of the self.  It starts out pretty well-reasoned, with the cogito itself -- "cogito, ergo sum", or "I think, therefore I am."
[06:18:14] <Varde> If you can't detect my experience of qualia through my communication of it, then you must doubt improperly for some random solipsistic fear(they happen to teach us lessons).
[06:18:39] <apotheon> Shortly after that, he starts getting until unsupported speculations, ultimately trying to prove the existence of God and not doing a very coherent job of it.
[06:18:51] <apotheon> . . . but the thinking behind "cogito, ergo sum" is great.
[06:19:24] *** Quits: CyberTailor (~cyber@gateway/tor-sasl/cybertailor) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[06:19:34] <apotheon> Anyway, if you say you experience qualia, I accept that as my default belief on the matter.  To do otherwise is dangerous.
[06:19:57] <apotheon> To do otherwise is pretty much tantamount to thinking you're an inanimate object.
[06:19:58] <Varde> I don't thus, shutdown, and my description of qualia is sufficient. So you don't trust me existing for a random reason, you don't start from neutral solipsism, but full fledged fear.
[06:20:09] <Varde> Ah I see.
[06:20:48] <apotheon> My acceptance of the claim that you experience qualia is strengthened by my own experience of qualia, proving to me that it is possible.
[06:21:20] <Varde> Yes, and since you weren't told if people do OR do not exist, there's no point in choosing either.
[06:23:01] <Varde> vardezomne.wordpress.com
[06:23:12] <Varde> That's where I posit philosophy
[06:24:05] <apotheon> I haven't been posting my philosophizing online so much, other than my moral caution theory of ethics.
[06:25:35] <apotheon> I should start posting some of it online now that I relaunched my personal website with a complete makeover.
[06:26:02] <Varde> Good.
[06:26:07] <apotheon> Maybe I should start with commentary on the cogito and, in particular, how people respond to it.
[06:26:16] <Varde> I'd follow you
[06:26:32] <Varde> Every day I have a new idea.

[06:30:48] <apotheon> I need an updated photo.  The one on the site is from half a dozen years ago.
[06:31:10] <Varde> You and I have similar tastes in design. I like the professional cozy look.
[06:31:19] <apotheon> My beard is longer.
[06:31:26] <apotheon> "professional cozy"
[06:31:27] <apotheon> I like that.
[06:31:34] <Varde> Cheers.
[06:32:25] <apotheon> My preference is for a darker look, no (necessary) JavaScript, obviousness, and readability.
[06:32:44] <Varde> I'm either but definitely minimalist
[06:33:13] <apotheon> yeah, simple is good
[06:33:18] <Varde> It's 3am and I'm pretty tired, probably be on tomorrow but for now I'm idling.
[06:33:24] <Varde> Thanks for the chat
[06:33:25] <apotheon> cool
[06:33:27] <apotheon> Sleep well.

[20:14:40] <apotheon> I think what evolv is saying is somewhat equivalent to "Convince me."

[20:15:13] <evolv> apotheon, "intrigue me" is sufficient
[20:15:32] <apotheon> . . . with the understanding that evolv has heard of other arguments about simulationism, so it would likely take an argument evolv has not seen before.
[20:15:38] <apotheon> evolv: yeah, or that
[20:16:37] <apotheon> evolv: Something inherent to the way Varde said it, though, is that Varde believes that it is not a full simulation, but only a simulation of the bare minimum to serve the senses of observers within the simulation.
[20:16:40] <Varde> The universe is rather large, seems to be lots of energy involved. There are lots of possible configurations and algorithms that could make it more compact. Seems a lot to carry.
[20:17:32] <apotheon> evolv: . . . such that, for instance, the internal forces of a distant star are not fully simulated unless/until someone is looking at it with that depth of perception.  The same presumably goes for simulating the contents of one's stomach.
[20:17:59] <apotheon> a resource-optimized simulation
[20:18:04] <Varde> Yes exactly.
[20:19:01] <apotheon> Then again, the simulator might exist in a universe so vast by our standards that simulating every detail of this universe might, for them, be equivalent to a toddler drawing a stick figure family for us.
[20:19:29] <Varde> Heh
[20:19:35] <apotheon> . . . so it could go either way, *if* you buy into the simulation idea in the first place.
[20:19:41] <apotheon> I'm not so sure I do.

[20:24:22] <evolv> it's not the first I've heard of we're possibly in a simulation that may require resource-optimization in a discussion
[20:24:30] <apotheon> You said this was not the first time you've heard of "it".  I'm trying to figure out where/when you've actually heard of someone suggesting that this is specifically the way our supposed simulation universe was operated.
[20:24:30] <evolv> does that address it sufficiently?
[20:24:36] <apotheon> okay
[20:24:38] <apotheon> thanks
[20:24:42] <Varde> I also think things in the universe are programmable, that each person is a different simulation. Per se, if I was to change a setting, such as universal mass, so the length of a body was 6 miles rather than 6 meters, it would only effect me.
[20:24:58] <apotheon> I evidently don't pay as much attention to simulationists in general as evolv.
[20:25:11] <evolv> neither do I, apotheon, but it comes up frequently

[20:25:51] <evolv> heuristic simulation of distant aspects of the universe?
[20:25:59] <apotheon> As you say, though, it's not the most interesting idea, given its commonality of use in video games and other contexts.

[20:28:23] <Varde> Why does time seem to go faster or slower sometimes? I call it time sleuth, but don't get it(:
[20:28:29] <apotheon> As I said, though, I'm not really convinced it is properly called a "simulation" if it produces self-aware, qualitative entities.
[20:29:00] <evolv> Varde, that can be addressed by materialism, idealism, etc.
[20:29:16] <Varde> I see.
[20:29:22] <apotheon> Of course, simulationism isn't really all that new, either.  We just didn't have the computer simulation metaphor before.
[20:29:34] <apotheon> Back in the day, they called the simulation creators "gods".
[20:29:55] <Varde> I have witnessed it going faster whilst I focus on it. I'm looking at the clock and it's still speeding on, whereas sometimes it's slow as hell.
[20:30:31] <apotheon> That probably has something to do with subjective experience based on how you're managing your attention.
[20:30:46] <apotheon> (on some level)
[20:31:44] <apotheon> There's also the fact that our visual senses actually run on a slower framerate than people expect, and the brain backfills imagery at times, resulting in a single second seeming to last longer.
[20:33:54] <Varde> If it is a resource optimized simulation, there's so many possibilities, entertaining prospects, such as owning land in a different universe or as I said before, programmable things.

[20:36:49] <evolv> perception of time, therefore, depends on the perception of change between two states, and states can be distance between forms, or one form to another
[20:37:59] <evolv> perception relies on identity to perceive time. That which is without identity, meaning without sufficient structure to identify with a mental label, cannot be perceived to change, thus there is no time to perceive

[20:39:57] <evolv> if able to perceive the entirety of phenomena, periods of relative stasis where objects appear will blur with the overall change because it is empty of identity

[22:10:12] <tomathy> the clothing pays beaurocrats mostly

[22:10:44] <varde> True.
[22:11:47] <tomathy> but ultimately because people are willing to pay that much
[22:11:48] <varde> A brand can up the price, and it take no extra skill or effort. It's not a complaint, I think it's good business.

[22:16:56] <varde> Barber is a good profit, but hairdressing is a lot more profit. Barbers are relatively easy work though.
[22:17:30] <apotheon> tomathy: Money isn't the root of all evil, but mistaking the map for the territory is certainly bad -- and a lot of people make that mistake with money.
[22:17:54] <tomathy> i see
[22:18:22] <apotheon> When people get obsessed with the numbers, there's a problem.
[22:18:52] <tomathy> is love of money then, the non-being that persists - and so is evil
[22:19:22] <tomathy> since money will always exist as long as we do, and so will love. reluctantly love of money exists

[22:21:42] <tomathy> varde your question answers itself. you would feel as much heat as you can sustain without disintegrating
[22:23:57] <varde> Yes
[22:25:35] <varde> I think more precisely, the mind spheres heat, and the excess heat is an illusion that occurs. You take pain up to a max, and logically feel the excess in some other format.
[22:27:28] <tomathy> heat is just the motion of molecules and atoms
[22:27:36] <tomathy> the faster they are moving the "hotter" we perceive them

[22:29:33] <varde> Such as your backside being a target from an other dimensional attack, people breaking your spine and it regenerating to happen again and again.
[22:29:43] <varde> Yeah it is
[22:29:57] <varde> However, it is limited, but sufficient.
[22:30:34] <tomathy> i see hell differently to the common dogma
[22:30:55] <tomathy> it is merely a dustbin for the use of the psyche
[22:31:06] <tomathy> put every thought that scares you there
[22:31:15] <varde> Whooooooa
[22:31:19] <varde> That's a lot of pain

[23:08:33] <evolv> yes
[23:08:51] <ldlework> if you can imagine an alternative human species who has our exact biology, neurophysiology, cogntive function, overall behavior, including the self-report that they have internal experience, but take for granted that they don't
[23:08:58] <ldlework> then you can see where the duality arises
[23:09:40] <ldlework> if all their behavior, including the self-report of internal experience could be "materially" explained by mere cognition, then we don't require anything more. the "p-zombies", so to speak, are more reasonable than what we describe for ourselves
[23:10:15] <ldlework> but we believe that "mere" cognition is not enough to explain the actual phenomenology of our own internal experience, that cognition can not explain what it is like to actually look out of your eyes
[23:10:31] <ldlework> then... you start to demand something beyond the material cognition... something immaterial
[23:10:44] <ldlework> and immaterial things are what's meant by dualistic objects
[23:11:18] <ldlework> you go from having a monism, say, a universe in which all there is are the constituents of material physics, to a dualism, where you add "spirits" or "consciousness" etc ontop
[23:11:23] <ldlework> anyway back to work
[23:11:56] <ldlework> but if* we believe
[23:12:37] <tomathy> i would say materialism/physicalism is a cloak, and the person is pragmatism
[23:12:39] <arryana> hm.  i dunno, pussipupu.  i find it hard to believe such things.
[23:13:06] <pussipupu> D&D time, AFK :)
[23:13:15] <pussipupu> And fair enough, I certainly don't need to evangelise
[23:14:37] <tomathy> i did find it very weird that ingram rejects even the idea of the existence of minds

[23:17:48] <tomathy> well he opens the possibility that "the mind" or "our mind" might be an absurd proposition
[23:18:12] <tomathy> but it's just his opinion, he mentions he throws his opinion around

[23:19:34] <evolv> "I am an arahat, having attained that in April, 2003."
[23:19:54] <ldlework> i don't mind the conception of a mind as some kind of material device which qualifies in some class for having features of sensory input, and high integration of various feature learning modules, using any implementation/design possible
[23:20:10] <ldlework> even if you want to start talking about secondary psychological descriptions of such devices
[23:20:11] <evolv> Ingram claims to be an arahant and he's married
[23:20:13] <evolv> ridiculous
[23:20:33] <ldlework> but subjective internal experience seems hard to fit into a materialism
[23:21:13] <ldlework> i like graziano's take that the brain is obviously capable of producing all sorts of beliefs that can't correspond to physically possible phenomena
[23:21:27] <ldlework> so it might just be the case that we have some system that compells us to believe that we have such an experience
[23:21:39] <ldlework> any sort of introspection into the facts of the matter always come with the same answers
[23:21:44] <ldlework> "can I really experience my vision"
[23:21:50] <ldlework> *contemplates really hard and looks out eyes*
[23:21:55] <ldlework> Brain: yes, and this is what it was like
[23:22:04] <ldlework> basically, we are the p-zombies
[23:22:56] <ldlework> the category of pathologies called clinical neglect is really interesting evidence for that kind of model too
[23:22:57] <tomathy> the belief in the impossible is integral to our survival as a species
[23:23:13] <ldlework> we know of certain brain pathologies that lead to a absenting of features of subjective experience from self-report
[23:23:15] <tomathy> sorry wild claim
[23:23:24] <ldlework> things like blindsight, hemi-spherical neglect and others
[23:23:53] <ldlework> in the case of blindsight, we know that the patient's eyes are fine, their visual circuitry is working properly etc, but the patient self-reports internal blindness
[23:24:26] <ldlework> you can even do tests where you  can prove that the patient's brain is actually using visual information to conclude facts about the world, even though the patient  is never "let in on" this

[23:24:39] <ldlework> neglect is super fascinating...
[23:25:23] <tomathy> well the mind can clearly block out information. when i focus on something i see things go dark around the central point
[23:25:34] <tomathy> so her blocking out has gone haywire

[23:27:27] <tomathy> i have some wild ideas
[23:27:39] <tomathy> like that jesus and mohamad are the same guy

[23:40:38] <apotheon> sure
[23:40:55] <apotheon> It's difficult to find really solid evidence of mythic people's existences.
[23:41:17] <apotheon> (I don't mean "myth" in the sense of "false".)
[23:41:44] <evolv> that's true of any person of history
[23:42:12] <evolv> depending on your threshold of evidence
