[00:03:38] <chaos42> durandal_1707: are functions with more than one argument supported by sendcmd? I tried -vf "sendcmd=c='0.0 [expr] v360 yaw mod(T\,360)',v360=... with and without \ but it does not work. Functions with single argument work fine.
[00:08:38] <Guest38> I'm starting to think that a 16s 25fps mp4 at 6.5mb isnt that bad

This works if I put it in a file but not on the command line: 0.0 [expr] v360 yaw '-1*(mod(T/72*360+180,360)-180)'  It is probably an issue with quoting.

[16:43:05] <rxyevejh> Is there an "ffmpeg way" of conforming variable input framerate to a fixed framerate when doing realtime encoding in C++ with ffmpeg? As in, if your application is producing a frames at a rate between 30 and 35 fps based no performance, is there an established way of clipping that to exactly 30fps on the output or is it up to us to handle that?
[16:43:48] <BtbN> I mean, you can throw in an fps filter, and it'll just drop frames as it sees fit to hit 30 fps
[16:43:58] <BtbN> but that does not sound like a good way of dealing with that kind of setup
[16:44:19] <BtbN> If the framerate really is that variable, it might be best to just keep it variable?
[16:45:10] <rxyevejh> I think you're right, being variable would be much better. Is the fps filter you're talking about part of the core library?
[16:45:20] <BtbN> define "core library"
[16:45:23] <BtbN> it's in lavfi
[16:45:56] <rxyevejh> yes sorry, I meant part of ffmpeg not something I would write
[16:46:10] <rxyevejh> thanks

[17:03:07] <BtbN> you could still use the fps filter, and set it to something like 60 fps, and just let it duplicate frames to hit it

[20:20:40] *** Joins: AbleBacon (~AbleBacon@user/AbleBacon)
[20:21:25] <AMM> I don't think it is, but it's possible I'm unaware of how the data flows when multiple outputs are in use
[20:21:43] <kepstin> that's not true, the inputs and outputs are completely independent
[20:22:09] <kepstin> note that running multiple outputs in ffmpeg might be a bottleneck in some cases, since large parts of the ffmpeg cli tool are singlethreaded
[20:22:38] <AMM> Although since you can have a -c copy output and a -c libx264 output (and others), I wonder if ffmpeg is clever enough to optimize that
[20:23:18] <kepstin> huh, i didn't know you could actually do that combination.
[20:23:39] <AMM> I don't speak from experience, just expectations
[20:23:46] <AMM> if you can't do that combination then news to me
[20:23:48] <AMM> lessee
[20:24:53] <JEEB> jmes: you can just fine do a filter_complex that does a split and then if you map the output of that filter chain as inputs for the outputs, you decode (And possibly do stuff like deinterlacing if you add that to the filter chain) once
[20:24:55] <AMM> yep ffmpeg takes no issue with mixing in a -c copy
[20:25:40] <kepstin> oh, do you have to do a split in a complex filter to do that? I was under the impression that could could map the same filter output pad to multiple files :/

[20:26:13] <jmes> Ahh okay, thanks AWM, kepstin, and JEEB
[20:26:24] <AMM> hmm
[20:26:42] *** Joins: duuude (~user@user/duuude)
[20:26:44] <kepstin> well, at the very least, it's possible to use ffmpeg such that it only decodes once then encodes to separate outputs.
[20:26:52] <jmes> I was referring to this blog post by the way, for any that are interested https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2017/10/10/live-video-transmuxing-transcoding-f-fmpeg-vs-twitch-transcoder-part-i-489c1c125f28/
[20:27:33] <jmes> kepstin: yeah that's neat, that's what I was wondering
[20:28:21] <JEEB> I think if you literally only need decoding, it still gets done only once even by default if you juts have multiple outputs
[20:28:28] <kepstin> right, yeah, all the stuff mentioned in that post could be managed by taking advantage of features of ffmpeg's complex filter chain
[20:28:30] <JEEB> just that I've usually required stuff like deinterlacing as well
[20:28:31] <jmes> Though for my case I'm still going to have to use x265 directly for in order to do multi-threaded encoding
[20:28:55] <JEEB> multithreading is just fine with x265, so you probably mean something else
[20:29:04] <kepstin> (with the downside that ffmpeg's filter chain is - mostly - not multithreaded)
[20:29:08] <JEEB> *libx265
[20:31:02] <kepstin> i don't think there's any way for twitch to do the IDR matching they want without using ffmpeg via the library interface tho.
[20:31:06] <JEEB> also for the record, for stuff like live streaming you generally want something more keeping the output side not locked to input. since even if your input goes badonkadonk you probably want to keep a stable X fps output going on
[20:32:24] <kepstin> of course, if you're doing pass-through of source video (no transcoding) then there's not much you can do in that case.
[20:32:27] <JEEB> kepstin: if they want dynamic, yes. but most don't. they just want static X frame GOPs
[20:32:41] <JEEB> in which case just scenecut=0 and some gop length does it
[20:32:53] <JEEB> alternatively I think you can set some things in ffmpeg.c
[20:33:03] <kepstin> yeah, the issue is specifically that they want the GOPs to match between the original submitted video (which is passed through) and the transcoded video.
[20:33:33] <JEEB> that might actually be possible with the cli app, but I don't recall well enough
[20:33:47] <JEEB> not that I consider ffmpeg.c optimal for live streaming due to the reasons mentioned (you want to keep output running at constant rate, input be damend)
[20:33:55] <jmes> I'm glad I came here. You guys are hurting my brain with new knowledge

[20:36:14] <Helixdnb> so then if I have the ffmpeg -i in.mov -vf trim=end_frame=9728 out.mov as the command that trims it to length, when I'm trying to do: ffmpeg -vf trim=end_frame=9728 -i in.mov -i in2.mov -filter_complex "[0:v:0][0:a:0][1:v:0][1:a:0]concat=n=2:v=1:a=1[outv][outa]" -map "[outv]" -map "[outa]" output.mp4 I get an error
[20:37:36] <another|> you can only use one filter chain per output
[20:37:39] <jmes> JEEB: so to disconnect the input & output I'd have to detect when it's going bonkers and insert something else in it's place when that happens?
[20:37:45] <kepstin> you can't mix -vf and -filter_complex, you need t combine everything into a single filter chain
[20:38:18] <Helixdnb> alright, so then how do I take the first video, trim it out to frame 9728, and concat it with a 2nd video, then encode the concat as mp4?
[20:38:57] <Helixdnb> if possible, at a 60mb/s crf
[20:39:51] <another|> you don't have a target bitrate with crf
[20:40:18] <Helixdnb> sorry, used to AME/AE
[20:40:29] <another|> something like: -i foo -i bar -filter_complex ...trim...,concat.. -c:v .... out

[20:45:44] <JEEB> jmes: you to just disentangle the things completely. I don't think it's doable with just ffmpeg.c unless you have a separate application before it feeding it things at a constant rate (thus putting the problem of input handling outside of ffmpeg.c itself)
[20:46:42] <jmes> I think how it works is that the .mpd metadata file knows how to retrieve the required fragments at any given timestamp so when a dash client figure it should switch it just consults the mpd

[20:48:47] <JEEB> but in general matching GOPs makes sense. if a frame is a random access point, it should be such for all outputs

[20:52:52] <jmes> JEEB: ty for being patient with me - why would this kind of matching be necessary at all if the DASH client is in charge of alignment? It's possible my understanding about DASH is just totally wrong

[21:26:06] <akk> Hi! I'm trying to use ffmpeg with v4l2loopback to create a cropped copy of my webcam, something like: ffmpeg -i /dev/video2 -f v4l2 -video_size 1280x720 -filter:v "crop=800:600:240:60" -vcodec rawvideo /dev/video9
[21:26:59] <akk> but the  -video_size is ignored, it opens the webcam at some smaller and unpredictable size (so the command dies with "conversion failed!"). How can I specify what resolution to get from the webcam?
