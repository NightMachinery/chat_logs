[00:53:21] <oxipital> if the fears there - you are
[00:53:33] <sd> 09<M​aster_ControlFlow> So my boss offered me a promotion from system admin to a job he called “kinda a technical underwriter” working directly for the VP

[02:29:41] <gibby> dont fall for the classic mistake of curly fries either-- get the big fat steak fries

[02:33:08] <fritzwastaken> I dont want soggy fries halfway through
[02:33:53] <gibby> if they do the steakfries correctly, they're still crispy on the outside on a horseshoe
[02:34:06] <gibby> even with the 3 pounds of liquid cheese on top
[02:34:18] <gibby> besides, then none of the cheese gets to the meat and the bread
[02:34:39] <gibby> and you def want all that deliciousness to meld together 
[02:37:03] <signofzeta> You just have to eat it fast, before the cheese can sog the fries.

[05:59:06] <signofzeta> The "primary" DC is in a different AD site, so I had to do it there and then force replication.  No big deal, though.  It's working fine now.
[05:59:21] <signofzeta> These sites replicate only hourly for whatever reason (previous IT guy).
[05:59:30] <signofzeta> It's Azure, so it might be a bandwidth thing.  I'll have to ask.
[06:01:24] <signofzeta> Replication is working normally, but my team said to run those three commands on the schema master.  I guess they had issues with our other Exchange servers.

[11:20:39] <JollyRgrs> but the first yooka-laylee is free now on epic store
[11:20:50] <JollyRgrs> "And Playtonic's last game, 2017's Yooka-Laylee, was unashamedly a spiritual successor to Banjo-Kazooie -- another Rare classic from the 1990s."
[11:21:41] <xe0n> remember banjo on n64?
[11:21:43] <xe0n> xe0n does
[11:21:44] <xe0n> :D
[11:21:56] <JollyRgrs> :D I never owned it, but i rented it once and a friend had it
[11:22:08] <xe0n> "Playtonic wants to be clear: its new Yooka-Laylee game may look a little like Donkey Kong Country" first screenshot confirms

[11:22:40] <JollyRgrs> i'm REALLY upset

[11:22:47] <xe0n> donkey kong on snes was a technical feat i believe
[11:22:54] <xe0n> something something mvp did a video on it

[11:23:09] <xe0n> mvg*
[11:23:10] <xe0n> whatever
[11:23:12] <JollyRgrs> but there's a game for the oculus that is the.... spiritual successor to 1080... same devs, just made for VR and updated a bit

[11:55:56] <nobyk> what the fuck do you mean tab completion?!

[11:56:18] <csws> like "no<TAB>" to type nobyk

[11:56:28] <nobyk> yeah apparently
[11:56:29] <xe0n> 20 years and he's still learning new irc tricks!
[11:56:36] <csws> literally the most basic of them
[11:56:45] <xe0n> not yours
[11:56:47] <xe0n> yours is two tabs
[11:56:48] <csws> y'know nobyk on most clients if you hit the up arrow you can recall your previous line?
[11:56:53] <xe0n> cs<tab><tab>
[11:57:02] <csws> some clients you can set the tab order based on last spoken time
[11:57:11] <nobyk> yeah I know that csws 
[11:57:23] <nobyk> Man I'm gonna be tagging folks left and right now
[11:57:23] <JollyRgrs> or for me even c<tab> so long as he was the most recent "c" to talk

[12:32:50] <Oliber> our boss decided that he wanted to go netware because it was kinda good in at student environment, but our edirectory servers could NEVER keep time properly
[12:32:55] <Oliber> they'd constantly drift
[12:34:30] <Oliber> and out of time edirectory is kinda bad, they even paid consultants to come to troubleshoot, who had exactly the same problem and left everything in a worse state

[12:37:18] <Joe-Developer> I would but I stopped drinking coffee
[12:37:26] <Oliber> don't give me that
[12:37:38] <Joe-Developer> made my stomach feel awful
[12:37:50] <Joe-Developer> a mixture of coffee and energy drinks just made me feel ill all the time

[12:40:11] <Joe-Developer> yeah I used to live off them
[12:40:19] <Joe-Developer> stopped drinking them and felt good again
[12:40:25] <andcoffeforall> I only drink the sugar free ones because my office only has instant coffee and instant coffee is disgusting
[12:40:35] <andcoffeforall> But yeah, they're not great
[12:40:37] <Joe-Developer> now I drink sneak as a substitute
[12:40:51] <Joe-Developer> sneaks great, all the caffine, none of the sugar and tastes good

[12:43:31] <Joe-Developer> it is
[12:43:41] <Joe-Developer> only it's cheap to get in the UK
[12:43:52] <Joe-Developer> GFuel has big import and delivery charges to get it to the UK
[12:45:04] <Oliber> not seen sneak before, but i don't really look at the energy drinks
[12:46:02] <Joe-Developer> yeah well I used to have anywhere from 1 to 4 cans of either monster or redbull a day
[12:46:34] <Joe-Developer> then my mate was like "try this" I was like "ooo that tastes nice" he was like yeah buy this coz it doesn't have sugar but has all the caffine and it just mixes with water

[18:49:44] <JollyRgrs> whups
[18:50:03] <estranger> so the UniFi AP AC Lite says it uses max power of 6.5W but uses a 24W PoE injector... can I use a PoE port that delivers 15W to power it?
[18:50:03] <fritzwastaken2> yea, oh well, at least I have a second aws instance now
[18:50:18] <estranger> oh wait its a 24V injector not 24W
[18:50:29] <estranger> so I am thinking I should be fine with a 15W port
[18:50:46] <signofzeta> Some AC Lites only supported Passive PoE.  The newer revision supports regular PoE.  Check the bottom and see if it says "PoE"
[18:50:50] <fritzwastaken2> si, but if you overpower it people may complain and ask to move away from it

[19:55:20] <Sousapro> Versus suffering constantly 
[19:55:30] <PublicWiFi> ive been using outlook installs a lot lately
[19:55:35] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> I literally had to stop using the Azure UI cause it kept changing
[19:55:36] <PublicWiFi> I bet i've went over lol
[19:55:51] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> ADO is even worse but kinda stuck with it
[19:56:11] <mistiry> im ok with changes, but too frequently is a problem. moreso though its a problem when they only migrate half the shit over to the new UI
[19:56:40] <PublicWiFi> *microsoft laughs in windows 10 settings menu"
[19:56:41] <mistiry> so you have to bounce back and forth, or search around for what you want because they didnt properly get feature-parity before rolling the new UI
[19:57:23] <mistiry> thats my biggest issue. "Check out new Security and Compliance center!" "Oh wait, now there are separate Security and Compliance admin areas!" "BUT WAIT! You still have to go back to the old one sometimes"
[19:57:41] <fritzwastaken2> dont forget that there is still documentation on the 3 month old versions that are out of date
[19:57:50] <fritzwastaken2> but still linked in the OS/Azure client
[19:58:04] <oxipital> i'm really not clear how that happens
[19:58:14] <mistiry> CI/CD
[19:58:16] <oxipital> i mean, os wise i can see maybe how it does
[19:58:21] <oxipital> but there's only x webpages
[19:58:31] <oxipital> even on a project as big as azure
[19:58:51] <mistiry> the "webpages" are a tiny part of what you're interacting with 
[19:59:15] <mistiry> the backend is much more complex
[19:59:35] <mistiry> and rolling changes and half-implemented updates are a result of CI/CD
[19:59:42] <mistiry> one piece gets done, it gets deployed
[19:59:45] <mistiry> piece by piece
[19:59:57] <mistiry> instead of releasing a finished product and subsequent updates later
[20:00:02] <oxipital> sure but unless the backend is dynamically generating the ui, inconsistencies shouldnt really pop up like that
[20:00:39] <corn266> but i was told that devops was a good thing
[20:00:40] <PublicWiFi> docker is super fun so far
[20:00:47] <PublicWiFi> building images from images is sick
[20:01:55] *** Quits: giant_it_burrit (sid229391@brockwell.irccloud.com) ()
[20:02:09] <mistiry> the inconsistencies are because they deploy pieces at a time, like i said. Dev Team A merged the feature branch into master, kicked off the pipelines that deployed the new Exchange admin design. So if you go look there, you get new design. Other parts of the system havent been merged into master and deployed, so they still get the old design.
[20:03:30] <mistiry> Obviously, the actual process to deploy new changes is much more complex, with automated testing and such built into their pipelines.
[20:03:44] <oxipital> without a design bible or any ui/ux guidelines i guess
