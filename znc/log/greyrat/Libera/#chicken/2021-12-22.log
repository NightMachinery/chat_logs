[08:00:21] <s-liao> Zipheir after installing the new (srfi-207) egg,it can the input like #u8"Ford"  can be read.
[08:01:09] <s-liao> But the two things, I would like say.
[08:02:10] <s-liao> One is in the page https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-207/srfi-207.html, "(make-bytestring! bstring 2 '(#\s #\c "he" #u8(#x6d #x65))"
[08:02:36] <s-liao> There is a ) missing in the s-expression
[08:05:03] <s-liao> Second is that, it might not related to this SRFI. but I noticed that, like you have user-read-hook, then call read-bytestring-or-vector, then ((#\") (read-textual-bytestring #f port))
[08:09:45] <s-liao> The read-textual-bytestring function, which is open-output-bytevector in (scheme base). it basically is open-output-string, then get-output-bytevector, which is get-output-string. Both open-output-string and get-output-string are from chicken.base.
[08:12:07] <s-liao> But in (scheme base) open-input-bytevector has its implementation, it also can come down to (chicken base) open-input-string as well.
[08:12:41] <s-liao> Why it end up with its implementation in (scheme base)?

[09:13:31] <Zipheir> s-liao: Thanks very much for testing and reporting the mistake in the SRFI example.  I'll send a patch to the SRFI editor shortly.
[09:15:00] <Zipheir> s-liao: I'm not sure what you mean.  Are you saying the egg should use open-output-string and get-output-string from (chicken base)?
[09:19:26] <Zipheir> But, of course, we want bytevectors, not strings.

[10:41:08] <s-liao> Yeah.From what I saw in this version of read-textual-bytestring, basically use open-output-string and get-output-string from (chicken base).
[10:59:03] <vandusen> SPAM! SPAM! SPAM! by freee
[11:11:53] <s-liao> But there is not what we call open-output-bytevector and get-output-bytevector in bytevectors it just reuse open-output-string and get-output-string from (chicken base).

[11:30:12] <Zipheir> s-liao: I see what you mean.  That's inefficient, then.  I'll fix it in the morning.  Thanks for finding that!

[11:32:15] <s-liao> Okay. there is  a string-port concept in port.scm file. do we need vectorbytes-port as well
[11:37:33] <Zipheir> I don't know at the moment.  I need to get some sleep.  I'll be back on around 17 UTC.

[23:01:45] <Zipheir> Hmm, it seems to me that there's no reason to replace open-output-bytevector in srfi-207.  Who knows, maybe CHICKEN will have real bytevector ports in the future.
