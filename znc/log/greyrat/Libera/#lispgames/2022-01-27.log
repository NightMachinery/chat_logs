[22:51:59] <artchad> Ok, I made a polygon in OpenGL (vertices specified counter clock wise) and tried to use glCullFace(GL_FRONT) on it. I'd expect to see nothing, but I see the face, even though it should be a FRONT_FACING polygon. Any idea what's going on?
[22:53:41] <artchad> https://paste.debian.net/plain/1228627
[22:55:19] <mfiano> Oh jeez. It's been many years since I used the old OpenGL API. I really couldn't say. It could be nearly anything.
[22:55:35] <artchad> lol
[22:56:00] <artchad> I'm going through the examples, because I don't know C++ and cl-opengl uses the examples from the redbook.
[22:56:19] <artchad> wait... let me try that in the cl-opengl example. Maybe it behaves differently.
[23:00:41] * artchad 's brain is fuming
[23:01:55] *** Quits: notzmv (~zmv@user/notzmv) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[23:07:10] <artchad> Ok, I think it's a bad idea to play around with the opengl cffi, while not even grasping the C version
[23:07:29] <artchad> many C symbols are not present in cl-opengl.
[23:09:17] <mfiano> I think it's a bad idea to try grasping the C examples :P cl-opengl is lovely when using the modern API
[23:10:08] <mfiano> learnopengl.com is all I ever needed. This is of course assuming you already learned enough linear algebra to know how to transform matrices and stuff, though I think it touches on that in the introduction.
[23:11:12] <artchad> But there are not examples to follow along with.
[23:11:28] <artchad> I can compare the C code and the cl-opengl examples, which are simple rewrites.
[23:11:29] * mfiano looks and disagrees
[23:11:35] <artchad> hmm...
[23:11:45] <artchad> asd;fha;skdjg;asdg
[23:11:53] <artchad> what about GLES 2.1?
[23:12:11] <artchad> That's what my thinkpad x200 uses. How will learning modern opengl help me in programming for that?
[23:12:23] <mfiano> If you want to sacrifice modern things and support embedded/mobile devices/Web, sure
[23:12:37] <artchad> yeah, that was the idea.
[23:12:44] * mfiano hates ES
[23:12:49] <mfiano> too primitive for me
[23:13:02] <artchad> you can build on top of those primitives or not?
[23:13:06] <artchad> it's just a subset.
[23:13:35] <mfiano> No, not really
[23:13:40] <artchad> My projects don't have the same scope as yours. :D
[23:13:55] <mfiano> SSBO's only exist in 4.3+. I couldn't imagine not having them available for example.
[23:14:03] <artchad> I just want to be able to use blending modes.
[23:14:06] <mfiano> Even for small things like sprite sheets
[23:14:18] <mfiano> Ok sure, then do as you wish.
[23:14:29] <artchad> I haven't gotten to textures yet. I'm really interested in that part.
[23:14:53] <artchad> btw. Is there a endorsed sound library for CL?
[23:15:05] <artchad> GLUT is only for visuals.
[23:15:09] <mfiano> learnopengl is the best resource i know of, and the only one I can recommend. Lots of bad/wrong advice out there.
[23:17:01] <artchad> I'll just spend time learning all I can, until I eventually have an overview. Then in retrospect I can say wether your approach would've been better for me.
[23:17:02] <artchad> :D

[23:22:06] <artchad> I guess OpenAL would be the next best thing to be used with OpenGL.
