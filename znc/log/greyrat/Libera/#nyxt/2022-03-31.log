[00:47:02] <kenran> How would I go about building a "release" version for the current master branch from source? Something like the self-contained release I can download on GH for 2.2.4 I mean
[00:48:54] <waleee> kenran: you use https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/master/build-scripts/nyxt.scm (see the comments at the top of the file)
[00:51:40] <kenran> waleee: thanks! And dang, probably not going to work on my machine (NixOS, and I tried installing guix as a package manager a couple of times, never really working out).
[00:52:30] <kenran> I can build Nyxt from source just fine (with a minor fix to the shell.nix), but for some reason only the "release" version works well on my 2nd machine, so I was hoping to build a release for 3.x myself so I can copy stuff from aartaka's config :)
[00:53:36] <waleee> do you use nixos on the 2nd machine too?
[00:54:55] *** Joins: ente (~daemon@inferno.barfooze.de)
[00:54:58] <waleee> re guix on nixos, yeah, I can imagine there might be issues. At least the early versions of guix used the same daemon as nix
[01:00:36] <kenran> Yeah, my machines use nearly identical configurations.
[01:01:35] *** Quits: ente (~daemon@inferno.barfooze.de) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[01:02:07] <kenran> The NixOS version of Nyxt is a 2.2.3 iirc, and I have to disable the WebKit sandboxing there due to a Nyxt issue, but then it works fine on the main machine, but not the work one. Downloading the release is the only thing that works on both. But now I want to use the newer one :)
[01:03:21] <waleee> Are there different gpu-families (aka nvidia, amd and/or intel)?
[01:03:26] <waleee> * on the machines
[01:04:11] <waleee> ** I'm maybe assuming a too large degree of not-functioning
[01:04:23] <waleee> s/'m//
[01:04:25] <kenran> Both nvidia, but different cards. the thin
[01:04:44] <waleee> hm funky
[01:04:55] <kenran> The thing is that on the work machine (laptop) I can load websites but they show up "blank".
[01:05:18] <waleee> nyxt -v doesn't print anything suspicous?
[01:05:59] <kenran> I can still see some tooltips for instance, and I even found an issue in the Nyxt repo that looked a little like it, pointing to a Google popup to accept the cookies as the reason.
[01:06:40] <kenran> I'd have to check again on that machine, but I was hoping to just configure Nyxt (I'm not using it yet, but I'm pretty sure I'll want it as my default browser on everything :D) and then see if I can make it work there.
[01:07:15] <waleee> kenran: this issue https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/issues/768 ?
[01:09:50] <kenran> waleee: https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/issues/1913 <- this one I think
[01:10:01] <Kabouik> Hey, hope everyone here is fine, long time without checking the chat (but still using Nyxt every day of course).
[01:10:13] <kenran> it's only similar to my issue, as they both have to do with a google modal
[01:10:15] <Kabouik> I just stumbled upon this: https://github.com/rvaiya/warpd/ Thought you guys as Nyxt users could be interested.
[01:10:19] <waleee> Bonsoir Kabouik

[01:12:02] <Kabouik> No worries, that was accurate.
[01:12:06] <waleee> I think you mentioned that you had lived in Norway but was currently back in France
[01:12:13] <Kabouik> Absolutely
[01:13:00] <waleee> ooh warpd looks nice
[01:14:03] <Kabouik> Yup, I can see myself using that on my keyboard phone already, or on my SBC that serves as home theater PC which usually has no mouse

[01:19:05] <kenran> Oh, building from source on my home machine seems to have the same issue now :( Sites seem to load successfully, but I just don't see anything. Hovering things shows me tooltips.
[01:19:52] <kenran> I wonder if it's anything related to system libraries or the (capabilities of the) window manager (i3).

[01:21:54] <waleee> (is peeking atm)
[01:23:19] <waleee> kenran: which nix channel are you using?
[01:24:49] <kenran> waleee: I'm pinning my configurations to specific, recent commits.  Currently I'm on revision 1d08ea2bd83abef174fb43cbfb8a856b8ef2ce26.
[01:25:34] <waleee> ah, a fetchTarball afficionado
[01:27:03] <kenran> waleee: I've switched to flakes not that long ago, so that does the fetching for me :) btw, I haven't checked, but to build from source I've used the shell.nix provided by the Nyxt repo, but I don't think it does any pinning itself.
[01:27:47] <waleee> aha, have you checked if changing nixpkgs in that one to legacyPackages have any impact?
[01:28:21] * waleee checks if that was indeed the change that had been made
[01:29:10] <kenran> waleee: ahhh, no, but good point: if the Nyxt shell.nix does not pin anything itself, then I'm not actually using the channel that my flake is using! So my actual NixOS system nixos channel is used to build, and I never use that, so that might be ancient.
[01:29:14] <kenran> Thanks for having a look!
[01:29:27] <kenran> Definitely something I'll check :)

[01:31:47] <waleee> yeah, nixpkgs seems to have gotten a rename in the last flakes nix
[01:32:58] <waleee> or possibly the next version, the matrix discussion wasn't mentioning more details
[01:35:00] <waleee> oh. nixpkgs.legacyPackages maybe
[01:35:03] <kenran> I can't wait to get it to work in version 3 though! Nyxt seems like it's exactly what I want. Vim modes in existing browsers don't satisfy me, and qutebrowser feels a bit sluggish and not configurable enough. I guess "something as close to possible to Emacs, but as a browser" is what I need.
[01:35:41] <kenran> s/to/as
[01:35:42] <waleee> yeah, qutebrowser has a slight disadvantage by using python for the ui-code
