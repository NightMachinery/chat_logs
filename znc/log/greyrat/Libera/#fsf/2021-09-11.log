[04:03:24] <bugweiser> jitsi is a piece of junk. recently I was requested to partake in a jitsi chat meeting. I frantically raced across town desperate to find a friend with a browser that actually supported jitsi. Needless to say.. no browser could access stupid jitsi. Frantically we tried greasing out some of the glaring errors using grease monkey etc. But once we got it almost working it demanded access to microphone and camera ?!?!  But being desperate we even allowe
[04:03:24] <bugweiser> d that, and still it doesn't work.  Frustrated googling revealed this is a known problem in jitsi for slightly over a year.  Clearly the browser implementation was an afterthought 'written' (more likely auto-generated) without ever even looking at an average browser console (that would have spit out stupid error upon stupid error).  Just a handfull of people on a magical undefinable combination of both OS and browser can actually use jitsi. GRRR!! 
[04:03:25] <bugweiser> Junk !! I even accessed their irc channel but the devs can't be bothered (likely they are fed up with the endless stream of angry folk).
[04:11:09] <bugweiser> Security?? what ? from some folk who can't grasp that a text chat doesn't need access to microphone and camera?  Security.. what? from folk who can't be bothered to look at the some common browser consoles? Who can't get their act straight (and stop excluding so many many people) in over a year ?  the only jitsy thing I'll do untill I die is to recommend against that junk (and never ever again attempt to use it, there will always be better candidat
[04:11:09] <bugweiser> es).
[04:11:13] <xiews> I had over hours long talk using Jitsi without problem. I installed Jisti Meet.
[04:12:21] <joepublic> I am sorry you had such a poor experience, and that you are so enthusiastic about it.
[04:12:27] <xiews> What do you recommend then?
[04:13:35] <asdflkj_sh> bugweiser: they explicitly support only chromium iirc, were you on a chromium-based browser?
[04:14:21] <bugweiser> asdflkj_sh: in the past year they also claimed it only worked on firefox. 
[04:14:34] <asdflkj_sh> really? where?
[04:14:35] <bugweiser> iridium is a chromium based browser, and was in the list of browsers tried.
[04:16:03] <bugweiser> asdflkj_sh: in a bunch of their support channels, look for the loads of "I gave permission to use mic and cam (grrr) and it still doesn't work".  From what I (and friends) read every month they claimed it worked on a different magical OS/Browser combo.
[04:16:45] <joepublic> you and your friends read jitsi support monthly?
[04:17:05] <bugweiser> xiews, i'd recommend anything other than jitsi, as long as it works for normal folk.

[04:17:33] <bugweiser> joepublic, now we read the relevant threads over the past year. 
[04:18:07] <asdflkj_sh> one of my family members did have trouble getting there camera or mic (I don't remember which) recognized on MSW10, but it's worked perfectly for me the few times I've tried it
[04:18:18] <joepublic> okay.  There's kind of a dearth of free software entries in this category, and "some random anything but jitsi" isn't much of a recommendation.  Do you have a more specific recommendation?

[04:20:06] <asdflkj_sh> it's ui is not as simple and streamlined as Jitsi Meet's (bc it has presentation and other feautures designed for teachers lecturing classes), but you can manually collapse the extra toolbars and it usually works well

[04:21:16] <bandali> there's also gnu jami
[04:21:56] <bugweiser> I've used cryptchat, otr, telegram, irc. All work for simple folk on simple computers without bending over to google. Jitsy clearly doesn't. And from what i've seen in the html/javascript and browser console, the *last* thing I would *ever* do is install an jitsi program and let it acces my cam/mic (or whatever other crap it thinks it needs access to but really doesn't).
[04:22:23] <asdflkj_sh> Jami is nice bc it has non-JS encryption, but harder to get people to use since it has to be installed

[04:24:09] <White_Flame> isn't webrtc already encrypted regardless of jS?
[04:24:24] <bugweiser> asdflkj_sh: iridium should check that box and was tried

[04:27:55] <asdflkj_sh> iridium doesn't just remove parts that are evil in and of themselves, it also removes parts that are easy for evil sites to abuse
[04:28:01] <bugweiser> at the very least, fallback to text only should work. Clearly it doesn't, otherwise the bug-rapports would have been "connected to jitsy, have chat only, no cam/audio"  Instead the bugrapports are "gave permission for mic/audio, still can't connect"
[04:28:31] <asdflkj_sh> bugweiser: fallback to text works for me even on Palemoon
[04:28:50] <asdflkj_sh> which is nearly as unsupported as you can possibly get
[04:28:56] <bugweiser> that's the exact point i'm making. I and loads of others can't even get kicked into fallback.
[04:30:30] <asdflkj_sh> well, I still say try ungoogled-chromium, but that's all I can do, it works for me
[04:30:55] <asdflkj_sh> you aren't using some weird distro with no glibc or something, are you?
[04:31:19] <bugweiser> yes, but friends had win10
[04:31:51] <bugweiser> and palemoon, and basilisk and serpent and firefox lts, and also iridium.
[04:32:32] <bugweiser> the local public library computers also can't access (cous have no cam, and fallback being broken... thats end of story)

[04:34:54] <bugweiser> diggeng thorugh the forums landed loads of possible reasons including hardware permissions (not managed in browser) to even driver issuees.  As you said, it should detect that and if lucky get to textmode only, but for loads of people that isn't working. They are literally excluded entirely... which is a drag.. especially if the entire meeting was textonly to begin with :)
[04:37:04] <bugweiser> anywho, just my 2 cent.  Specifically, the people whom denied use of jitsi (and wanted to use something else) might have done so for good reason (notably not excluding people for no good reason).
[04:38:37] <asdflkj_sh> web tech is disgusting to me and I can only be grateful to the jitsi devs for wading into the mess to make a Free video chat I can get my grandma to join with the click of a link

[07:33:18] <tpefreedom> hmm
[07:33:27] <tpefreedom> It sure is taking a while.
[07:35:03] <tpefreedom> I'm getting interested in replacing "stock" (in practice samsung's rom) android with something freer.
[07:36:52] <tpefreedom> Replicant lacks 4G or 5G support so I'm looking and GNU/Linux distros for phones don't have very good hardware support outside of things like the pinephone (which isn't supported on my carrier) and the librem (which is crazy expensive).
[07:37:02] <tpefreedom> So I'm looking at other custom android roms.
[07:37:17] <DiffieHellman> I would recommend LineageOS.
[07:38:00] <DiffieHellman> Note that it won't work properly on install, you need to perform a full factory reset in LineageOS settings before it does.
[07:38:08] *** Quits: robin (~robin@user/terpri) (Remote host closed the connection)
[07:38:33] <tpefreedom> There are also /e/ and calyx and a buunch of other roms.
[07:38:44] <DiffieHellman> Still has nonfree libraries aplenty, but you really can't get any kind of tracking device without nonfree software.
[07:38:55] <DiffieHellman> LineageOS seems to be more updated/.
[07:39:32] <tpefreedom> Once you get out of preinstalled version of android it kinda looks like GNU+Linux in terms of how fragmented it is.
[07:40:16] <DiffieHellman> I mean, pretty much everything is based off ASOP, just with different stock applications.
[07:40:52] <tpefreedom> But it is still very fragmented.

[07:41:06] <tpefreedom> Maybe it's because I'm not exactly an android power user.
[07:41:14] <DiffieHellman> Fragmentation is arguably a good thing tbh.
[07:41:35] <DiffieHellman> GNU/Linux distros are slowly being taken over by systemd.
[07:41:38] <tpefreedom> Yeah, but it is also overwhelming when you are new.
[07:41:56] <tpefreedom> Basically the only major customization I've made has been insstalling fdroid.

[07:42:22] <tpefreedom> Otherwise I've just tinkered with wallpapers adn widgets and ringtones and whatnot.
[07:42:56] <tpefreedom> the lack of diversity in init systems is pretty annoying
[07:43:00] <tpefreedom> *and
[07:43:47] <joepublic> systemd is free software
[07:44:22] <DiffieHellman> Yes, but the head guy really loves calling it "open source" and making it a hardep for everythineg.
[07:45:17] <tpefreedom> I think the whole "systemd being a dependency of seemingly everything" thing is what people don't like.
[07:45:27] <clever> DiffieHellman: even bloody `ps` depends on systemd
[07:45:30] <clever> because systemd ate udev
[07:46:06] <tpefreedom> ps?
[07:46:17] <clever> tpefreedom: as-in `ps aux`
[07:46:39] <DiffieHellman> Well there was eudev, but that has been depreciated of course.
[07:47:32] <tpefreedom> and mdev (from busybox), but who really gives a damn about busybox?
[07:49:42] <DiffieHellman> mdev looks decent, too bad it's not 1:1 with eudev.

[15:10:11] <DiffieHellman> Linux is the name of a kernel. Linux on its own is only acceptable when you're actually talking about Linux.

[15:11:23] <DiffieHellman> Using correct terminology is not elitism.
[15:11:34] <kreyren[m]> that makes sense i retract my statement
[15:11:52] <bugweiser> ok, then "unixlike linux based"
[15:12:04] <bugweiser> tiny core linux is also called "linux".
[15:12:30] <bugweiser> and is an independedt linux distro
[15:12:38] <DiffieHellman> Unix is the name of a proprietary OS, so you can't compare it to a kernel.
[15:12:53] <bugweiser> seems proper terminology.. they distribute a linux kernel + userland to get a working machine.
[15:13:16] <bugweiser> unix-like is a common and clear terminology, google it :)
[15:13:18] <DiffieHellman> Lets see, what OS does tiny core use...
[15:13:42] <DiffieHellman> bugweiser: Stop using google as a verb, you disgust me.
[15:14:16] <kreyren[m]> "just duck it!"~
[15:14:20] <DiffieHellman> Tiny core uses BusyBox, so the OS is; BusyBox/Linux
[15:14:38] <kreyren[m]> i prefer the term BB/Linux
[15:14:56] <DiffieHellman> That's fine as long as you mention that BB stands for BusyBox
[15:14:58] <kreyren[m]> also there are things like ostree and nixos
[15:15:16] <bugweiser> I disgust myself in that particular regard :)  But I don't know of ANY searchengine that gives better resuls (though google is getting worse month after month, if they keep that up soon even duckduckgo will be better.
[15:15:43] <kreyren[m]> maybe you should searX it~
[15:15:59] <bugweiser> and that includes swisscows, mojeek, zasnav. 
[15:16:04] <DiffieHellman> I don't know what NixOS uses, but it seems that the OS is the nix package manager, so that would be Nix/Linux
[15:16:48] <DiffieHellman> ostree seems to be more of a package manager over an OS.
[15:16:51] <bugweiser> searx just relays google results as so many other 'engines' do. If they don't have their own crawler then it's not a searchengine but a relay (usually to google, sometimes bing).
[15:17:13] <DiffieHellman> searX is a metasearch engine, meaning it uses results from multiple search engines.
[15:18:05] <DiffieHellman> Sadly searX instances often stop working for some periods, as search engines like to block searX due to too many requests. 
[15:18:21] <kreyren[m]> DiffieHellman: false!
[15:18:34] <kreyren[m]> https://searx.be works all the time~
[15:18:47] <bugweiser> also, 9 out of 10 queries on duckduckgo gimme only 2 pages and the second page ends with an 'eof' link which points to google.
[15:19:37] <bugweiser> try comparing results of 'searchengines' like startpage, searchX, duckduckgo etc.. Do it for a week, see how almost identical the very very short list of results are.
[15:19:37] <kreyren[m]> and NixOS uses violated FHS3.0 to mangle directory purposes and symlinks everything from /nix

[18:16:20] <bugweiser> also, one could (depending on dos version (kernel)) swap out command.com for another one.
[18:16:53] <bugweiser> (and if the kernel sufficently supported whatever an external command (aka program, currently called app) then that would work to.

[18:18:19] <bugweiser> ofcourse the command.com would also support a script/programming *-like* interface. Providing some conditionals and loops etc. 
[18:19:02] <jxself> Maybe it's not worth trying to find where to draw a line? I think the central point is to not go with the prevailing thought patterns that the system is really "Linux", and was made by Linus Torvalds with a little bit of help from some other people, who then just totally randomly happened to find that everything else that they needed just happened to already available from gnu.org...
[18:19:11] <bugweiser> so.. basically, 'internal/external' command / program / app   always were seperated by a thin line. If any.

[18:22:20] <bugweiser> and in the dos era (and similar school of thought) we just had to files to configure for 'initing' the system.  How things got this tremendesly complicated (upon where our init-systems when systemd need to access the internet and dns) is kinda beond me
[18:22:58] <bugweiser> jxself, so basically indeed I agree. the 'line' is (and always has been) hard to draw.
[18:23:48] <bugweiser> and in essence I do think that the kernel itself is more relevant to the system than the binary that lets you dir/ls a directory.
[18:26:14] <bugweiser> and let's not beat a dead horse for the binary that does the task of 'echo'  :) which then (due to major widespread inconsistend implementations) was to be fixed by replacing it with printf (which then partially went through the same tried and failed history of echo).

[18:32:17] <bugweiser> so busybox (!=gnu) on linux, I still type 'ls' to get a directory listing, becouse the 'linux' part makes me expect that this the proper thing ('command') to type (instead of 'dir' which is what I would type on a windows/dos system)
[18:33:24] <gerikson> it's a "*nix" part because ls works on BSD/Solaris/AIX too
[18:33:28] <gerikson> and PowerShell has ls
[18:33:42] <gerikson> and, of course, GNU Coreutils has 'dir' ;)
[18:33:58] <bugweiser> indeed, indeed, and good/fun to know
[18:34:41] <gerikson> honestly found out about GNU dir last week 
[18:35:38] <bugweiser> that's kinda my point here, Kernals (historically) kinda dictate general mechanics/commands/workflow which then (loads of) binaries replicate (and possibly expand upon over the argument features).
