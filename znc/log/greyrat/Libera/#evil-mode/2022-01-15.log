[01:21:38] <agnem> Hi! I'm having an issue customizing evil-disable-insert-state-bindings. Evil initializes the variable with evil-custom-initialize-pending-reset - but the value I customize it with seems to be overwritten when evil is loaded. This happens when I use custom-theme-set-variables but not if I use customize-set-variable. Anyone had any similar issues?
[01:24:53] <agnem> Seems likely to be this issue https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package/issues/702. Typical that I would find that shortly after posting here ...
[02:06:50] <wasamasa> set it before evil is loaded

[02:36:53] <b63> Hi all, was trying for a while to customize my mode line with mode-line-format but unable to as I'm also wanting to run a custom evil-generate-mode-line-tag for colors.
[02:37:07] <b63> Anyone have any snippets on how this would be possible?
