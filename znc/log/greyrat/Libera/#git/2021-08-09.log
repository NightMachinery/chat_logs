[01:11:36] <j416> that'll bring up an editor. Not sure what's the easiest way, but one easy way is to change "pick" on just line 1 to "edit", save and close. That'll get you back to your shell prompt, where you'll run: git commit --amend --no-edit, after which you run: git rebase --continue.
[01:11:42] <j416> that should do it.

[01:12:05] <j416> also, !backup
[01:12:05] <gitinfo> Worried about your data while trying stuff out in your repo? The repository in its entirety lives inside the .git directory in the root of your work tree so to backup everything `cp -a path/to/workdir path/to/backup` or equivalent will suffice as long as the repo is not modified during backup. See also http://sethrobertson.github.com/GitBestPractices/#backups
[01:12:22] <j416> note that rebase will eat merges.
[01:13:22] <j416> the reason for the edit is to modify the timestamp of that commit, to cause that and all subsequent commits to be rewritten.
[01:14:49] <j416> if all goes well, you should have the right committer locally, and git will tell you that you're 100 commits behind and 100 commits ahead (or whatever number you have) of the remote branch.
[01:16:41] <Walex_away> xx: probably you need 'git rebase --root' as it looks as if you are not rebasing "branch" A on "branch" B
[01:16:54] <j416> Walex_away: no need
[01:17:02] *** Walex_away is now known as Walex
[01:22:37] <xx> for some reason, it is not picking up the changed name and email in config
[01:22:55] <xx> but it uses it if I create a new commit
[01:25:59] <j416> xx: how are you verifying that?
[01:26:14] <xx> by checking `git log` afterwards
[01:26:27] <j416> that'll show author name and e-mail, not committer, by default
[01:26:45] <j416> I take it then that when you said committer above, what you meant was author
[01:26:56] <j416> git log --format=fuller  # will show the correct committer
[01:27:19] <xx> git is so complicated...
[01:27:40] <Walex> xx: I did something like that a while ago and right now I am bit sleepy so the only detail that I remember is that I used the special case of 'git-filter-branch' without arguments. IIRC
[01:28:12] <j416> if you're fine with the author dates getting modified, you can do the exact same as above, but add --reset-author to git rebase.
[01:28:14] <Walex> xx: 'git' is actually quite simple, but the way it is described is highly misleading and the "porcelain" is terrible.
[01:28:27] <j416> if that's an issue, start over, but use filter-branch with --env-filter instead.

[01:36:29] <j416> well, relatively
[01:36:45] <j416> no need for that if you're going with filter-branch.

[01:38:17] <j416> it's how I learnt. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[01:38:41] <xx> I haven't looked at it - does it actually walk you through everything?
[01:38:48] <j416> to be clear, use rebase _or_ filter-branch. No need for both.

[03:41:44] <yaymukund> I've got some incomplete checkout of a repository on CI. How can I additionally fetch all the SHAs for a particular branch? I tried `git fetch --no-recurse-submodules origin <the sha of the branch's most recent commit> but no luck.
[03:42:16] <yaymukund> by SHAs, I just mean the commits
[03:44:55] <BtbN> fetch the branch
[03:47:41] <yaymukund> so `git fetch origin <branch>` should fetch the commits reachable by the tip of that branch?
[03:51:06] <yaymukund> I am not used to working with a shallow tree. It looks like it's first doing `git fetch --no-tags --prune --depth=2 origin +<SHA>:refs/remotes/pull/1234/merge` and then `git checkout --force refs/remote/pull/1234/merge`.
[03:51:36] <yaymukund> I guess those refs are some GitHub feature.

[05:55:40] <Tetractys> hi
[05:55:57] <Tetractys> if i have 2 repos, how can i merge them into 1?
[05:56:32] <imMute> are they clones or are they totally unrelated histories?
[05:56:39] <Tetractys> in my case the second repo was started from a copy-paste of the first repo's last commit
[05:56:50] <Tetractys> now i want to "merge" it back
[05:57:55] <imMute> I think you might be able to add the second as a remote to the first and then do a merge
[05:58:10] <Tetractys> ohh, ok, cool idea

[11:47:20] <tsdh> I have "*.java diff=java" in .gitattributes but still the hunk headers frequently show the wrong method name.  It looks like they use the method name coming first when searching backwards which doesn't have generics in the signature.  E.g., with void foo(){...} List<Integer> bar(){...} and a change in bar(), the hunk header reads "foo()".
[11:48:48] <tsdh> How can I find out which [x]funcname regexp it actually uses?  git config --get diff.java.funcname / diff.java.xfuncname print nothing and return non-zero.

[13:45:35] <varmonger> Hi! why is git ignoring the .gitignore file in a git-submodule? am I missing anything?
[13:45:54] <varmonger> I mean git is still tracking changes to dirs listed in .gitignore inside a submodule
[13:46:05] <osse> !ignore_tr
[13:46:05] <gitinfo> [!ignore_tracked] Git only applies ignore patterns to untracked files. You can't use ignore patterns to ignore changes to files that are already tracked by git. To remove files only from git, but keeping them on disk, use git rm --cached <file>. Still, see https://gist.github.com/1423106 for ways people have worked around the problem.
[13:48:53] <roxlu> thanks osse ! I've read up on the double and triple dots; and I somewhat understand what they are doing but I have to do a quick test to get a better understanding

[14:00:31] <Helmholtz> Can't it sync with upstream brances?
[14:00:54] <roxlu> osse: when I look at `master...feature = $(git merge-base feature master) feature = D L` in your paste, what is the meaning of that line? Does that show the diff between D and L ?
[14:00:55] <j416> Helmholtz: git checkout master && git branch --merged | xargs git branch -d
[14:01:22] <j416> Helmholtz: deleting is local
[14:01:44] <j416> Helmholtz: --merged compares them to your local branch ("master" in this case)
[14:02:21] <j416> Helmholtz: also you might want to remove the remote tracking branches (git branch -r)
[14:02:47] <Helmholtz> j416, thanks..i just manually deleted
[14:02:58] <j416> Helmholtz: you can remove all tracking branches that no longer exist on the remote using git fetch --prune. You can also make this the default by setting fetch.prune to true.

[14:08:56] <roxlu> and lets say instead of `master` I use another feature branch, then it would also try to find the common ancestor and do a diff. In my case I'm seeing a lot more changes in my feature branch when I diff it with another branch then when I did with the master branch (well actually I did it with another named branch, but that doesn't matter). I don't full grasp what the meaning is of the many other
[14:08:58] <roxlu> changed files I see.
[14:09:24] <roxlu> e.g. I do: `git diff upstream/4.3...mybranch` which lists ~10 changed files
[14:09:39] <roxlu> and when I do `git diff upstream/4.4...mybranch` lists ~60 files.
[14:12:15] <j416> roxlu: try "git-merge-base upstream/4.3 mybranch" separately to see which commit it gives; perhaps that'll make it more clear
[14:12:25] <j416> s/git-merge-base/git merge-base/
[14:14:13] <j416> roxlu: man gitrevisions also has examples of syntax
[14:14:13] <gitinfo> roxlu: the gitrevisions manpage is available at https://gitirc.eu/gitrevisions.html
[14:15:18] <roxlu> thanks j416 going to read that
[14:19:01] <j416> never realised that the gitrevisions man page only explains ranges, and not the diff syntax
[14:20:09] <j416> man git-diff explais .. vs ...; but not in much more detail than osse's summary above
[14:20:09] <gitinfo> the git-diff manpage is available at https://gitirc.eu/git-diff.html
[14:20:14] <j416> explains*
[14:20:45] <roxlu> j416: yeah I should def. take more time to dive into this, but trying to get a quick intuition atm ..
[14:21:26] <roxlu> form that gitrevisions.html page I notice that they mention: `It is the set of commits that are reachable from either one of r1 (left side) or r2 (right side) but not from both.` for the 3-dot `git diff` usage
[14:21:46] *** Quits: Betal (~Betal@user/betal) (Quit: WeeChat 3.2)

[14:28:40] <j416> roxlu: log takes a range of revisions, diff takes two revisions. These are unrelated. The gitrevisions man page explains syntax for the former. The diff man page explain syntax for the latter.

[14:29:09] <roxlu> j416: I'm referring to a diff
[14:31:09] <roxlu> yes, so the diff compares two commits starting at a common ancestor (when using the 3 dots) and showing the changes which are in the 2nd branch compared with the first one
[14:31:32] *** Quits: christall (~christall@24.235.88.243) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[14:31:47] <j416> not compared with the first one, compared with the common ancestor.
[14:31:53] <roxlu> j416: e.g. `git diff upstream/4.3...origin/feature` would show the diff between the last commit in feature compared to the common anchestor.

[14:33:43] <j416> did you try finding the merge base of the two?
[14:34:28] <roxlu> yes
[14:34:38] <OnkelTem> Hi folks. A gitlab question please, if you don't mind. I try to get a file from our gitlab, but I don't get how to construct URLs that their API understand. For example, here https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/repository_files.html#get-raw-file-from-repository - they show that paths should be api/v4/projects/repository/files/.... but I cannot find such a URL in the UI. Any ideas?
[14:35:01] <roxlu> with the `git merge-base ` command you showed
[14:35:02] <j416> roxlu: perhaps if you try to find that in something like "git log --oneline --graph", it'd make it more clear?

[14:37:01] <__that__> Hi all
[14:38:01] <__that__> By adding "*.zip !text !filter !merge !diff" to .gitattributes I am telling lfs don't even think about tracking .zip files, am not I?
[14:38:01] <gitinfo> [!filters] Filters can be very useful for automatically making changes to files at checkout(smudge) and checkin/add(clean). See 'man gitattributes' for more information
[14:38:01] <gitinfo> 'git merge' takes two diverged lines of history (series of commits, e.g. on different branches), and recombines them with a "merge commit" on top. This creates an explicit record of you doing the merge, unless there were no local changes (which does a !fast_forward merge instead). If you don't need to keep a record like that, !rebase may produce easier-to-read history, but the two don't always mix well... see also !merge_vs_r
[14:38:01] <gitinfo> "git diff": show unstaged changes. "git diff --cached": show staged changes. "git diff HEAD": show all uncommitted changes.

[17:00:13] <cbreak> darkxploit: maybe.
[17:00:21] <cbreak> depends on how the server's set up.

[17:02:21] <j416> darkxploit: I bet you can achieve that via the GitHub API.
[17:02:28] <cbreak> that worked for me with gitlab recently
[17:02:45] <cbreak> it created the repository since it didn't already exist
[17:02:55] <cbreak> of course, since gitlab's web UI sucks, it didn't call it repository
[17:02:58] <cbreak> it called it a project
[17:03:08] <cbreak> but that's what you'll have to live with if you use bad UI devs :(

[19:06:08] <ash_worksi> so I am learning from multiple sources that git submodules are a dire cause for concern
[19:06:32] <ash_worksi> or, the bane of many people's existence or something
[19:06:35] <imMute> eh. the're wonky to work with, so you gotta have open eyes.  but I woudn't call them "dire"
[19:06:59] <imMute> and they're no harder for a git person to use than git is for a SVN user.
[19:07:05] <ash_worksi> anyway, I was thinking of using it as kind of a "pull-only" way to get a docker db up-to-date
[19:07:11] <bremner> imMute: or svn for a git user :P
[19:07:13] <j416> ash_worksi: it's another thing to learn, they're a bit wonky to quote imMute, and many have trouble with them, so avoiding them unless there's a good use-case is often a good idea
[19:07:33] <ash_worksi> well, you can tell me if it's a good use case then
[19:07:46] <imMute> ash_worksi: for tracking other projects that you don't really commit to is exactly what they were made for
[19:08:49] <ash_worksi> docker's postgres container has an initdb.d dir which you can plop in a dump and have a current db; so I thought if I just commit the current dump when ever I migrate, that can be pullable as a submodule to that directory and also it'll basically show what's changing on each commit
[19:09:23] <imMute> sounds like a reasonable use case for submodules
[19:09:40] <ash_worksi> "to that directory" = "the initdb.d directory for any dev project"
[19:10:37] <ash_worksi> okay, well, the last thing I need to do is find out how to "migrate" global stuff
[19:10:59] <ash_worksi> I think it's fine to commit a database dump... I think
[19:12:00] <imMute> depends.  I would err on the side of "no", but I can see some use cases where it's not terrible
[19:12:38] <imMute> like that time I had to work with location -> time zone mappings.  best way to handle that is to have all the data in a big dump somewhere since it's managed by a 3rd party and infrequently changes

[19:17:35] <ash_worksi> nonetheless, my guess is that you'd generally prefer to distribute migrations along with the app and have that update the dev database?
[19:18:52] <imMute> I'm not really up and up on database things for web applications. but yeah, migrations are one thing I hear about frequently
[19:21:56] <j416> ash_worksi: I haven't grasped everything but wouldn't it be enough to just keep your migrations?

[19:24:36] <ash_worksi> j416: the only problem there is... at least for this project; the enviroments for which you work on migrations and the one where you work on your application are fairly different -- at the moment, they are in separate repos. I actually didn't expect that fact to ruffle so many feathers; I kind of felt like if you're using a non-app specific tool to manage migrations then it would seem right to do that in
[19:24:42] <ash_worksi> it's own repo
[19:25:18] <ash_worksi> j416: the point is, if I wanted to keep them separate, then they'd have to pull the whole set of migrations as a submodule
[19:26:21] <j416> that sounds a bit backwards
[19:26:42] <ash_worksi> like `git clone my_app; cd my_app/db; git clone --recussive-submodules my-sql;`
[19:26:43] <j416> but, sure
[19:27:04] <j416> you'd want to define the dependency somehow
[19:27:15] <j416> I assume your program logic depends on the migrations
[19:27:25] <ash_worksi> the second clone would get you everything you need to get the db up and running with a simple `docker-compose up`
[19:27:33] <j416> and an early version of your project (say you check out an earlier commit) might depend on not all migrations having been run yet
[19:27:41] <j416> I'd try to couple them.
[19:29:37] <ash_worksi> j416: also, the repo for my_sql holds pgtap tests and verify scripts and rollback tests; I just don't know if someone should be concerned about all that

Is that because a commit can have multiple parents?
