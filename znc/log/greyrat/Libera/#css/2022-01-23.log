[03:55:52] <rairden> Can someone help me w/ this css snippet? Question on the page https://codeshare.io/50Lexm
[03:57:26] <rairden> Can I write those in one line? I tried writing it as a double class selector, but wouldn't work.
[04:01:36] <eXtr3m0> rairden just "square.move-dest" as selector will select both of them. not sure what your goal is.
[04:01:57] <rairden> Ok thanks eXtr3m0. I'll try that
[04:03:54] <rairden> eXtr3m0, that is not working. What I'm doing is playing chess on lichess.org "Play w/ the computer" on unlimited time. The css is to remove the "legal moves" and premove squares.
[04:08:50] <FunkyBob> unless the goal is to out-specify a .oc selector
[04:54:05] <Sqaure> ok, this is not very impressive, but i want to fix it for a demo. Image processes you can build step by step. https://imgur.com/a/IsfEKv3
[04:54:22] <Sqaure> ...but im all out of idea hos to add delete function into this interface.
[04:54:56] <Sqaure> Image = Imagine
[04:57:12] <eXtr3m0> Square: on hover, show a small red circle at the top right with a white X in it. if user hovers it it says "delete this item".
[04:58:16] <Sqaure> eXtr3m0, but if i move to delete-icon, wont I unhover the hover trigger area?
[04:59:31] <eXtr3m0> not if the delete icon is a child of one of these steps.
[04:59:57] *** Quits: silverdust (~silverdus@user/silverdust) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[05:01:18] <eXtr3m0> you could do it via a speudo element ::before or ::after
[05:01:26] <Sqaure> eXtr3m0, so you mean it should be inside the bounds of the "arrows"? They are pretty small 61x25px
[05:02:52] *** Joins: jazzy (~jaziz@user/jaziz)
[05:03:04] <eXtr3m0> you could either just replace the contents on hover (overlay the X ontop of the check icon). or put a little badge at the top right.
[05:03:32] <Sqaure> like float on top?
[05:03:45] <eXtr3m0> jup
[05:04:24] <Sqaure> do you have an example of how ::before would work?
[05:05:02] <Sqaure> can i solve this with css alone is what you mean?
[05:05:31] <eXtr3m0> you can do it via .my-step-selector { position:relative; } .my-step-selector::before { content: "x"; position: absolute; font-size: 1rem; width: 1rem; height: 1rem; top:-0.5em; right:-0.5em; display:none; } .my-step-done-selector:hover::before { display:block }
[05:06:02] <Sqaure> ok ill try that
[05:06:06] <Sqaure> thanks a bunch
[05:06:34] <eXtr3m0> take any element and select it via css for example p. then you can dynamically include a pseudo element at the firstchild (::before) or the lastchild (::after) via p::before { content: 'hello'; }
[05:06:47] <eXtr3m0> maybe with my code display:block still needs to be applied as well, not 100% sure.
[05:09:01] <Sqaure> you overestimate my level here. I suck at css.
[05:09:52] <eXtr3m0> can you provide the code in a nopaste?
[05:10:37] <eXtr3m0> with my code the element is hidden. you need to make sure to amend the .my-step-selector css selectors to match your html markup.
[05:10:48] <Sqaure> eXtr3m0, i believe its too much interconnected shit to make a simple testcase of what i have.
[05:11:07] <eXtr3m0> :D no worries mate, its just basics. :D
[05:12:19] <eXtr3m0> instead of the pseudo element, you can also just place a <span class="close">x</span> inside of your items and amend the css selectors again
[05:12:24] <Sqaure> .my-step-selector = the "hidden" part .my-step-done-selector = "hover area"
[05:12:55] <eXtr3m0> .my-step-selector should be the selector of your items. you basically want to place a "x" inside every item, but it should be hidden.
[05:14:19] <eXtr3m0> with .my-step-done-selector you only select the items that have a check item inside. (in a real world case you would probably have such a class, but if you have it card coded, no worries, just ignore this selector and use .my-step-selector:hover::before { display: block; }

[05:18:24] <eXtr3m0> if you just paste css+html here: https://codepen.io/pen/ it would remove confusion.

[05:18:36] <eXtr3m0> :D
[05:21:10] <Sqaure> eXtr3m0, yay it seems to work!
[05:21:30] <eXtr3m0> that's great to hear, I'm glad!
[05:21:58] <Sqaure> how would i turn the X into a proper link though?
[05:22:12] <eXtr3m0> Did you use the ::before trick?
[05:22:30] <eXtr3m0> Or did you insert a <span>?
[05:22:30] <Sqaure> i basically just took your code and applied it
[05:22:39] <Sqaure> ...the first css you posted
[05:22:45] <eXtr3m0> Okay. Well yes this would be only possible via JavaScript.
[05:23:21] <eXtr3m0> If you plan to do it without JavaScript, then you would need to place a <a href="#" class="close">x</a> inside of each item
[05:23:43] <Sqaure> ah ok
[05:23:43] <eXtr3m0> and then change the css selector from .my-step-selector::before to .my-step-selector .close {}
[05:23:47] <Sqaure> ill try to adopt that
[05:23:57] <eXtr3m0> abd .my-step-selector:hover .close {}
[05:24:41] <eXtr3m0> you can give the .close element also styles like background:red; color:white; border-radius:50%;
[05:27:45] <Sqaure> how about .my-step-selector:hover::before  { ... } part? will that change with the switch to .close case ?
[05:28:32] <eXtr3m0> it should become .my-step-selector:hover .close {}

[05:34:14] <eXtr3m0> cool, you're welcome
[05:35:28] <eXtr3m0> and do you get what the different properties do?
[05:35:52] <eXtr3m0> btw: you can remove the content: "x" property.
[05:36:07] <eXtr3m0> this is only required when declaring a pseudo element like ::before or ::after.
[05:36:20] <Sqaure> yeah i get the hang of it. And i love how the hover of the parent even if hovering the child that is outside of it.
[05:36:40] <Sqaure> i got all in on the ".close" version
[05:36:50] <eXtr3m0> Good stuff
[05:37:10] <Sqaure> im programming web in haskell so im a bit detached from the .js parts
[05:37:38] <Sqaure> but yeah, can do what it does - just differently
[05:38:28] <eXtr3m0> you mean its all on the server side?
[05:41:09] <Sqaure> no, you write haskell and compile it to .js
[05:41:26] <Sqaure> pretty similar approach as React i believe
[05:41:32] <eXtr3m0> Ah okay interesting, never heard this is an option
[05:41:35] <Sqaure> React + Redux more
[05:42:11] <Sqaure> pretty good to have same awesome language on server and client.
[05:42:17] <eXtr3m0> I heard these words, but I do everything in vanillajs

[06:02:00] <Sqaure> now it works as intended. Somehow the trashcan is a bit faded, but it gets highlighted in strong red on hover.
[06:02:17] *** Quits: \mSg (mSg@user/msg/x-0285936) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[06:02:33] <Sqaure> im very satisfied with the solution and how little work it was.
[06:11:02] <eXtr3m0> I personally would give it a background and a circle, so that its easier to click for the user. Also I would suggest that this small button overlaps with the element it will delete, so its cristial clear for the user what to expect.
[06:11:28] <eXtr3m0> Sqaure yes CSS is very powerful.
[06:15:17] <eXtr3m0> Also the question might arise if that is enough for mobile users. If they would tab on one of the green items, it would permanently have the :hover state (like the :focus state on desktop).. so that would then show the delete icon that they must click again. So technically it would work, but the question is if the user would expect this on mobile. Easy solution would be to add a little sentence
[06:15:17] <eXtr3m0> "click to delete an item". Another option would be to permanently show the delete icon on all items all the time on mobile. In that case it shouldn't be too distracting. The fact that an item is done should be more prominent then the delete option.
[06:18:53] <Sqaure> eXtr3m0, good points. Ill try to adopt them
[06:20:07] <Sqaure> im no UX person really i just wanna demo an implementation of the server / client logic running on haskell power!
[06:21:02] <eXtr3m0> Great power deserves great user interface. :D
[06:22:44] <Sqaure> Thats more correct than false and that is disturbing sometimes. People judge apps after the UI which is wrong imho.
[06:22:47] <eXtr3m0> Sorry to ask but are you aware of the F12 developer tools? you can change all properties of any element at run time and see your changes.
[06:23:06] <Sqaure> that part i know and use extensively
[06:23:28] <eXtr3m0> perfect
[06:23:57] <Sqaure> i mean a great application needs a great UI, but everything that hasnt a great UI is judged to be crap it seems
[06:23:59] <eXtr3m0> Square my understanding is interaction creates emotion
[06:24:42] <eXtr3m0> great UI for me means it's easy to use and it does what you'd expect in small amount of interactions
[06:25:01] <eXtr3m0> UI is a problem in itself and just translates between your rock solid backend and the user
[06:26:00] <Sqaure> totally agree. But some applications can be given makeup even if they suck underneath. That bothers me often.
[06:26:16] <eXtr3m0> And if the user doesn't 'feel it', it doesn't make them happy. If they enjoy looking at it and using it and they learn they can trust its functionality they will get inspired by it and fall in love with it. :D
[06:26:37] <eXtr3m0> What I find painful is to realize that the best thing microsoft can do is teams
[06:26:47] <eXtr3m0> which is everything but a smooth user interface experience.
[06:27:25] <eXtr3m0> From the sheer performance point of view. Every click or hover feels like such a hassle.
[06:27:49] <eXtr3m0> Maybe its because so many people are using it and they just want to save on capacity.
[06:28:34] <Sqaure> only tried that once. We use Zoom and that is equally bad.
[06:28:50] <Sqaure> I guess many companies rushed things out during covid?
[06:28:57] <eXtr3m0> Computing and Graphics power increase and App performance decrease. :D:D
[06:29:14] <Sqaure> Zoom is made in electron and that isnt working well on linux atleast.

[06:31:14] <hmw[at]> It wouldn't have had enough RAM to hold a web page either. ROFL

[06:32:15] <hmw[at]> VT yeah. That should work even with under 64K
[06:32:52] <hmw[at]> (4KB to hold one page? Someting of the sorts)
[06:33:02] <eXtr3m0> I guess the point is also IT could be much more efficient
[06:33:08] <hmw[at]> oh yes
[06:33:38] <hmw[at]> The problem is mostly with complexity. We can't afford to optimize, because we can barely make current stuff to begin with

[06:41:44] <eXtr3m0> I think one of the main problems is that decision makers have no idea about the code and that there's too much hype and people start on an abstraction layer too high up.
[06:42:21] <eXtr3m0> there are plenty of examples for nice optimized software though. I love sublime text and mirc. just works.

[11:49:08] <friend> I'm not sure why the flex item is changing size since I have flex:1 1 on the button. It seems like as long as the button contents don't exceed the flexed size, it should remain the same.

[12:27:55] <FunkyBob> friend: flex: 1 means it's allowed to change size
[12:28:25] <friend> RIght, I needed the button to change size but not it's contents
[12:28:46] <FunkyBob> which button is supposed to be c hanging size?
[12:29:06] <friend> kb_btn
[12:29:50] <FunkyBob> why are your buttons divs, and not buttons??
[12:30:06] <friend> but kb_btn .lbl.shift is different size from kb_bt .lbl.deflt making the button wiggle when toggling between the two labels.
[12:31:48] <friend> that's super easy to change at any time, really. this was just to get the concept down.
[12:32:39] <FunkyBob> ok... it's hard to debug when clicking it does nothing for me
[12:33:13] <friend> In the explanation, I suggest that the problem is with the shift key using the keyboard
[12:34:05] <FunkyBob> i see
[12:34:06] <friend> All i had to do was make the .lbl class have a min-width of more than the widest character width. That ensured it wouldn't resize.
[12:34:35] <FunkyBob> i don't see any sizes changing
[12:35:49] <friend> sorry, man. give me just a second to put it back so you can see what I was talking about.

[15:59:41] <Slartibart> Pseudo class selector question: If I have the selector 'input:read-only', could the pseudo class then simply be ignored?? I clicked on the 'Mark all elements that match this selector' next to it in Developer tools, and then a bunch of elements that shouldn't use :read-only(from my understanding), like input submit elements. Should that selector be rewritten to only match a restricted set of input types?
[16:01:08] *** Quits: kristijonas (~kristijon@78-56-32-39.static.zebra.lt) (Remote host closed the connection)
[16:01:14] <Slartibart> ..or is :read-only somehow "on by default"? That would sound crazy..
[16:02:28] *** Joins: kristijonas (~kristijon@78-56-32-39.static.zebra.lt)
[16:06:10] <eXtr3m0> Slartibart your "input" selector selects <input type="submit"/> which makes sense, doesn't it?
[16:06:54] <eXtr3m0> you could change it to input[type="text"] to only match those elements.
[16:07:24] <Slartibart> eXtr3m0: ..except that I would've expected the :read-only to add some extra filtering.
[16:08:02] <Slartibart> bootstrap.css seems to use 'input[readonly]' instead, that's another way to do the cat I guess :)
[16:08:38] <eXtr3m0> well there is this attribute contenteditable which, when applied to an element, makes it editable by the user. Even a p. WYSIWYG editors often use that function to work.
[16:08:40] <Slartibart> eXtr3m0: But you're right about the selector, I'll probably do it that way. Thanks.
[16:09:05] <eXtr3m0> so indeed you could make it so that a user can edit the contents of a submit button.
[16:09:12] <eXtr3m0> if you diodn't set it, it's read-only.
[16:10:35] <Slartibart> Ah. That actually makes sense(it makes using :read-only way, way more trickier though). Very good point! I'll no doubt rewrite the selector now. Thanks :)
[16:12:42] <eXtr3m0> input[readonly] seems to do exactly what you are looking for, yes
[16:13:02] <eXtr3m0> The readonly attribute is supported by the text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and password input types.
[16:13:08] <eXtr3m0> Button isn't even supported!
[16:15:13] <Slartibart> ..which is why I thought it was weird that 'Select all elements that match selector' included both type button and submit.
[16:15:43] <Slartibart> ..but like you said, if contenteditable is added to the equation..
[16:17:27] <eXtr3m0> Yeah I get the confusion. :D

[16:41:26] <ph88> i have a button with id="foo" and a label with for="foo"  when i press the button some effect is applied to label this works well in pure css without JS. Is it possible to add a second button to control the same label ?
[16:44:36] <eXtr3m0> My understanding is the label controls the button. I assume with some special css selectors you could turn that around. Maybe you could even add a second one.
[16:44:47] <eXtr3m0> BUt these CSS only solutions are highly dependant on the HTML markup.
[16:44:57] *** Joins: stenno (~stenno@user/stenno)
[16:45:00] <eXtr3m0> I think it this case it would be helpful to see the code you are talking about
[16:45:22] <eXtr3m0> you can paste it here: https://codepen.io/pen/
[16:45:53] <ph88> code is here https://daisyui.com/components/drawer  example "sliding drawer menu"  click on HTML tab to see code
[16:47:07] <ph88> inside this area <label for="my-drawer" class="drawer-overlay"></label>  i want to add a cross X to indicate the user can click there to close the menu. But when i just put a button inside that label the button doesn't do anything
[16:47:52] <eXtr3m0> if you don't put a button, but a simpler element like span or div, it should work.
[16:47:54] <ph88> actually when i change my <button> to <div> it seems problem is solved as it keeps functionality from parent <label>
[16:48:06] <ph88> right thanks for thinking along eXtr3m0
[16:48:21] <eXtr3m0> np.
[16:48:29] <eXtr3m0> if you put a button inside of a label, that label click is not being triggered when clicking on the additional button.
[16:49:24] <ph88> eXtr3m0, one other question .. parent label has opacity 0.4 .. it should stay this way. But element within text is not bright enough i suspect it is also affected by opacity. I tried setting opacity to 1 on inner element to no effect what else could i try ?
[16:49:50] <eXtr3m0> opacity cannot be overwritten by child elements.
[16:50:18] <eXtr3m0> well you could for example add the opacity to the background color value: rgba(123, 123, 123, 0.5)
[16:50:30] <ph88> ok i will try that, thanks

[17:43:07] <barkle> is there another way to draw slanted div borders besides clip-path and a wrapper ?
[17:44:07] <eXtr3m0> probably you could use ::before and ::after for a certain effect.
[17:47:47] <barkle> what effect?
[17:48:17] <eXtr3m0> Can you show case what your goal is?
[17:48:33] <eXtr3m0> slanted, like 45degree on all 4 edges?
[17:49:22] <barkle> no only one side
[17:49:37] <eXtr3m0> Ah now I think I got it, you talk about having it like a trapez
[17:49:38] <barkle> but basically for all directions should be
[17:50:13] <barkle> resizing pretty much destroys the clip-path
[17:50:47] <eXtr3m0> Can you show a demo? would help. https://codepen.io/pen/
[17:52:16] <barkle> https://jsfiddle.net/b5L8kus0/

[17:55:31] <barkle> one color but how would it matter?
[17:56:50] <eXtr3m0> If you for example change the background color of the body to red, in your current solution you'd see a white background behind your div still.
[18:07:41] <eXtr3m0> barkle do you want those angles to stay fixes or be dynamic?
[18:08:23] <barkle> what do you mean ?
[18:08:27] <barkle> i'll be back later
[18:08:37] <eXtr3m0> resizing "destroys" it.
[18:08:50] <eXtr3m0> I assume you want to have it in a certain angle like 45°.
