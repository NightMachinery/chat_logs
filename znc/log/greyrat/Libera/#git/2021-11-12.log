[01:47:21] <canton7> "Nothing can go wrong" is a bit of a strong statement, heh. I don't think the Drobox/OneDrive issues are solely that people aren't waiting for things to sync, from what I've heard, too

[02:14:35] <GitStudent> I saw that someone was playing this symlink game a decade ago :   https://stackoverflow.com/a/2376265      where they suggest:   "Why not just crank the gc.pruneExpire variable up to never?"
[02:16:07] <imMute> aren't worktrees the equivalent now? (except actually supported)
[02:16:30] <GitStudent> so I thought, OK, great, looks like it will work (for some definition of work)  ...   but then I'd be responsible for making sure garbage collection and pruning happens properly
[02:17:03] <GitStudent> imMute  quite possibly, I'll have to read up on that
[02:17:44] <imMute> just based on the title, it seems like that's what they want.
[02:18:11] <GitStudent> the title of that stackexchange post?
[02:18:48] <imMute> yeah.

[02:23:18] <GitStudent> you might be right.    but my (overly elaborate) use case is a bit different...    but no,  let's say I have two repositories...   each that happen to share 80% of the same files, each identical.

[03:02:57] <osse> effectively the same thing
[03:04:05] <osse> except in your scenario you're doing way to much work :p and you create a new commit on master, which will have the changes (I assume that's your point) but it will still be a different commit

[03:06:35] <puff> Ah, okay, that shouldn't be a problem.
[03:07:06] <puff> There's a related complication, I did some file renames via the IDE and didn't realize that the IDE automatically staged them.
[03:07:24] <puff> So this way I can do those renames separately and make them a separate commit, which will be cleaner.

[14:02:14] *** Quits: spare (~xvgs53vtx@user/spareproject) (Remote host closed the connection)
[14:03:02] <canton7> that will merge 'bar' from 'origin' into your local branch 'foo'

[15:15:40] <teut> I cloned a repo  without forking  https://github.com/vishal2612200/NirogGyanCompanyWebsite
[15:15:58] *** Joins: sebastorama (~sebastora@190.83.56.68)
[15:16:03] <teut> now I made changes and want to push to my colleague
[15:16:09] <geirha> git help remote  ->  git remote set-url [--push] <name> <newurl> [<oldurl>]
[15:16:28] <drogas> `git remote rename oldname newname` ?
[15:16:53] <geirha> ah yeah, you should probably add a new remote
[15:17:00] <teut> now I forked it , and have set  "abc" as my fork
[15:17:05] <drogas> i.e. `git remote rename origin newName` ? or do you mean the URL because it's been moved?
[15:17:20] <teut> so "abc" is fork
[15:17:57] <teut> so now I need to rename his origin to  fork and then delete "abc"
[15:18:14] <geirha> git remote set-url origin git@github.com:abc/NirogGyanCompanyWebsite.git
[15:19:06] <teut> https://github.com/Teut2711/NirogGyanCompanyWebsite-1
[15:19:10] <teut> this is my fork
[15:19:39] <geirha> copy the clone url from the webui, and  git remote set-url origin <paste-the-url>

[16:51:22] <lantech19446> it's kinda moot now anyway though because I realized an issue with trying to do this. The guy who coded the site has made every page php just so he can include the logo more easily so 98 percent of the page is html in a .php file extension and also some pages contain inline js so I don't think a minifier will even work

[17:09:31] <drogas> does just running `git push` assume by default `origin` and the current branch? i.e is `git push` the same as `git push origin foo` if you are in foo

[17:14:38] <canton7> drogas, that's a long story. See 'push.default' in man git config
[17:14:39] <gitinfo> drogas: the git-config manpage is available at https://gitirc.eu/git-config.html
[17:15:19] <canton7> The default push strategy these days is 'simple', which pushes just the current branch to a branch with the same name on the remote, but you can change that

[17:15:42] *** Joins: henko (~henko@62-178-187-35.cable.dynamic.surfer.at)
[17:16:11] <canton7> In terms of which remote it pushes to... See man git push. "When the command line does not specify where to push with the <repository> argument, branch.*.remote configuration for the current branch is consulted to determine where to push. If the configuration is missing, it defaults to origin."
[17:16:11] <gitinfo> the git-push manpage is available at https://gitirc.eu/git-push.html
[17:16:29] <drogas> change it to what? could you do `git push origin bar` when you are currently in `foo` ? wouldn't you need to be checked in `bar` to be able to do that
[17:16:44] <canton7> So it tries to use the branch's tracking information to find which remote the corresponding remote branch is on, otherwise it falls back to 'origin'
[17:17:04] <canton7> drogas, ... one of the other options in that section of that man page
[17:17:33] <canton7> You can do 'git push <remote> <branch>' from any branch. The stuff I'm talking about is *just* for 'git push', without a '<remote>' or '<branch>'
[17:18:11] <drogas> okay I see I got you now
[17:18:34] <drogas> I just remember back in the days we used to do `git push origin master` or whatever and we don't have to do that anymore
[17:18:46] <canton7> You never *had* to do that
[17:19:13] <canton7> (top tip: you can use 'HEAD' to refer to the current branch, e.g. 'git push origin HEAD')
[17:19:15] <drogas> I see don't know why they taught us to do that back in uni then
[17:19:52] <canton7> I guess because it's obvious and requires less learning? It's always clear exactly what's going on, and it doesn't complain if there's no remote branch with the right name already
[17:20:44] <drogas> gotchu, thanks canton7
