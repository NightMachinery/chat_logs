[00:01:15] <xHire> Hi! Does anyone know whether it’s possible to disable showing docs on double-tab in irb? I happen to live without rdoc and irb rather chooses to die with an exception in some contexts. :·)

[00:08:03] <leftylink> oh wow, didn't know irb did that...
[00:08:19] <adam12> leftylink: New addition.
[00:08:27] <adam12> xHire: I'm not sure that's a configurable option...
[00:14:03] <xHire> it’s weird that gentoo let’s me install ruby without rdoc, which leads to things not really working. I quite understand it, though. Anyway, looking at the code now, installing rdoc seems like the best option

[05:59:35] <skered> Can you not limit gem upgrade to just user-install gems?
[06:00:41] <skered> update rather.
[06:01:48] <skered> Or an gem command...
[06:16:32] <havenwood> skered: You mean user installed as opposed to those that ship with Ruby?
[06:40:02] <skered> Or system installed.
[06:40:13] <skered> Maybe they shipped with ruby.
[06:41:14] <havenwood> skered: I can't think of any `gem update` command flags but you could probably use Gem in Ruby to get at the list you're meaning to update.
[06:42:00] <havenwood> skered: For example, here I grab all gem names then remove the default gems: Gem::Specification.all_names - Gem::Specification.load_defaults.flat_map { |default| Dir.chdir(default) { Dir.children('.').map { |child| File.basename(child, '.gemspec') } }
[06:42:35] <havenwood> Might be a more elegant way to do that but one isn't coming to me.
[06:42:42] <havenwood> skered: Why?
[06:43:20] <havenwood> You could get an explicit list of what you want to update, then either shell out to `gem` or just also update them within Ruby with Gem.
[06:43:41] <skered> Can a gem name have a - in it?
[06:43:55] <skered> Seems like I could just use the filesystem for the list.
[06:43:57] <havenwood> Yup.
[06:44:00] <skered> blah
[06:44:17] <skered> ~/.gem/ruby/*/gems/
[06:44:23] <havenwood> In IRB try running: Gem::Specification.load_defaults.flat_map { |default| Dir.chdir(default) { Dir.children('.').map { |child| File.basename(child, '.gemspec') } }
[06:44:29] <havenwood> I'm just doing that.
[06:45:43] <havenwood> If you want, you can `child.rpartition('-').first` or use regex instead. I left the `-version` since RubyGems understands the version but easy to strip it.
[06:46:09] <havenwood> You can't have a number following a dash and the final dash is always trailed by a version, so you can get at the name easy enough.
[06:46:56] <havenwood> skered: I'd suggest updating the default gems. They're meant to be updated. Why pin them? Also, pin them.
[06:48:25] <havenwood> One of the big reasons to ship gems is that security fixes and bug fixes can be made in stdlib without replacing your entire Ruby.
[06:48:34] <havenwood> I'm skeptical of not updating them. Why?
[06:48:37] <skered> Because they're part of the system so I'd rather not mess with them.
[06:49:09] <havenwood> They're intentionally meant to be updated. Those that go beyond intention will refuse to install.
[06:49:11] <skered> This is macOS so I'm not going to touch them.
[06:49:31] <skered> So I might install ruby via macports instead.
[06:49:41] <havenwood> Maybe avoid system Ruby entirely and install a Ruby to play with yourself. Most of us go that route, yeah, good call.
[06:49:56] <skered> That was another option as well.
[06:50:37] <havenwood> Macports Ruby will play nice alongside system Ruby without interfering. Many of us need multiple Rubies so we use chruby, rbenv, or RVM to switch between them.
[06:51:02] <havenwood> Macports and Brew Rubies play nice alongside chruby/rbenv/RVM too so you don't have to pick just one way.
[06:51:15] <skered> However, I would leave gem updates to macports.
[06:51:44] <skered> I like to keep system, alt. system (/opt ex: macports), and user installed stuff to the user.

[06:53:09] <havenwood> skered: here's an example of Homebrew with chruby, but chruby works with Macports just the same: https://gist.github.com/havenwood/ba31f67c1d89ac236400
[06:53:35] <havenwood> then you can `chruby system` and have it detect .ruby-version files if you want to auto-switch to the right Ruby version.
[06:53:47] <havenwood> Or just plain 'ole Macports and toggling yourself works fine!
[07:02:07] <skered> I would almost be alright with ignoring all system gems...
[07:12:12] <skered> Ok so I think maybe using rvm or rbenv.
