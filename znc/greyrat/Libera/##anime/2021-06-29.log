[00:36:59] <Nanobot> Bitcoin AB=CD target at exactly $37000, which is right in the middle of the June 15 OTE short zone. Those are signs of a likely drop after that level is hit, with a downward AB=CD target that would put it in the March 2020 OTE long zone ($16914 - $27169 range). I'm hoping to do the rest of my buying in that range, in anticipation of new ATHs in the coming months.

[07:05:53] <MootPoot> Time limit? 
[07:06:17] <MootPoot> Oh they gave you an extended delivery date? 
[07:06:32] <MootPoot> Idk when that happens it's a 50/50 for me if it arrives or not 
[07:06:52] <MootPoot> Usually in that case I'll just cancel and order and redo it and it comes faster

[07:07:12] <MootPoot> Occasionally in my case 
[07:07:34] <MootPoot> Out of I guess every 50-60 orders 1 never arrives for me 
[07:07:45] <amigojapan> MootPoot: but if I do that it cancels the Amazon prime day discount
[07:08:01] <MootPoot> I'll wait a few days extra, then I'll talk to Amazon support they will cancel it and I'll do the order again 
[07:08:07] <MootPoot> amigojapan: in that case just wait 
[07:08:14] <amigojapan> Ok
[07:08:16] <MootPoot> What does the tracking say?

[07:18:11] <amigojapan> Ah right
[07:19:06] <amigojapan> MootPoot: the Amazon tablets I will have should support wireless charging

[07:22:41] <MootPoot> They do 
[07:23:18] <MootPoot> It's just that the only option for 99% of use cases for consumers is Qi so people just call that wireless charging and people know that means Qi

[07:27:46] <MootPoot> amigojapan: ooo it can do fast wireless charging 
[07:27:58] <amigojapan> Nice
[07:28:09] <MootPoot> So you need a quick charge 3.0 adapter and a fast charging pad, 15w ideally

[07:31:45] *** Parts: BlackSmithY (~BlackSmit@ddxwzhygk1chxml0hls5t-3.rev.dnainternet.fi) (Leaving)
[07:32:23] <MootPoot> So the where I use it is that I pick up my phone user for 5 minutes and then put it down again and 100 or more times a day at my desk if I was still using the cable I would have to plug it in and out those hundred times versus just putting it on the pad again and again
[07:34:42] <amigojapan> MootPoot: tomako usually just leaves her iPad plugged in all the time
[07:34:56] <amigojapan> That may be what killed the battery
[07:35:45] <MootPoot> Hmm
[07:35:47] <MootPoot> Probably not 
[07:35:50] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: fork seals are a messy job best left to a bike shop
[07:36:02] <MootPoot> Modern charging ICs should know what to do 
[07:36:07] <ButterNoodle> I dont have the room or the patience for that kinda work anymore
[07:36:16] <Sxem> the battery gets blue balls if you dont let it discharge sometimes
[07:36:17] <MootPoot> amigojapan: how old was this tablet? 
[07:36:45] <MootPoot> Sxem: really? I thought ideal state for most batteries was to minimize cycles as much as possible
[07:36:55] <amigojapan> MootPoot: only like 4 years old
[07:36:59] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: how much is he gonna charge you 
[07:37:08] <ButterNoodle> 3-600
[07:37:08] <Sxem> no, batteries last longer if discharged 
[07:37:11] <MootPoot> amigojapan: yeah...4 years is pushing it for a LiPo honestly

[07:38:22] <MootPoot> Yeah lipos are different
[07:38:38] <MootPoot> Lipos don't like to be completely charged or discharged

[07:39:10] <Sxem> oh, google says Shallow discharges and recharges are better than full ones, because they put less stress on the battery, so it lasts longer. When your battery is discharging, Battery University recommends that you only let it reach 50 percent before topping it up again.
[07:39:18] <MootPoot> Deep cycle lead acids can do that full discharge
[07:40:18] <Sxem> Lithium-ion batteries should not be frequently fully discharged and recharged ("deep-cycled"). You may need to discharge it fully occasionally to recalibrate the capacitiy measuring electronics in the accumulator. Every 30 cycles or so should be enough.

[07:42:15] <Sxem> google says Minimize the amount of time the battery spends at either 100% or 0% charge. Both extremely high and low ‚Äústates of charge‚Äù stress batteries. Consider using a partial charge that restores the battery to 80%
[07:42:27] <Sxem> i thought 40 was ideal but looks like 80 is the new ideal

[07:59:37] <MootPoot> Then accounting for losses and stuff , cut that by 20%  
[07:59:49] <MootPoot> amigojapan: he was running his split AC off it lmao 
[08:00:04] <amigojapan> I see
[08:03:14] <theholyduck> amigojapan: fridges are relatively energy efficient 
[08:03:32] <MootPoot> Woah it's mommy duck
[08:03:43] <ButterNoodle> you can run everything off of modern inverters
[08:03:46] <theholyduck> Its one of the things most people infact do power with off grid stuff
[08:03:54] <ButterNoodle> just make sure they can cover the surge current
[08:04:13] <ButterNoodle> biggest problem with the fridge is the defrost circuit
[08:04:23] <MootPoot> Ooooo I know 
[08:04:24] <ButterNoodle> it pulls 10amps
[08:04:32] <theholyduck> Since refrigiration is one of the most useful things you can do with power
[08:04:47] <ButterNoodle> central air conditioning...
[08:04:48] <MootPoot> For his AC at least he got his electrician to wire up a capacitor bank just for that 
[08:05:01] <MootPoot> I didnt k ow you could get capacitors at that voltage 
[08:05:08] <theholyduck> ButterNoodle: I think off grid optimized ones don't use defrosts
[08:05:10] <ButterNoodle> surge current on an average size unit is ~60amps
[08:05:24] <theholyduck> Or you disable the defrost
[08:05:28] <ButterNoodle> theholyduck: or have the option to turn them off..
[08:05:29] <ButterNoodle> :)
[08:05:32] <amigojapan> theholyduck: your battery will last much longer if you don't have a fridge or AC ruining off it
[08:05:50] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: its just a consistent draw tbh
[08:06:00] <theholyduck> amigojapan: ac sure.  But fridges don't use any power really
[08:06:06] <ButterNoodle> running current is pretty low
[08:06:10] <theholyduck> Because they are so insulated
[08:06:14] <ButterNoodle> like 2-3 amps
[08:06:16] <amigojapan> I see theholyduck 
[08:06:49] <theholyduck> The only time a fridge has to work is when you open it.  More or less
[08:07:16] <ButterNoodle> so when ur parents yelled to shut the damn fridge door.. they had a reason
[08:07:32] <amigojapan> Apparently freezers are much more efficient than refrigerators
[08:07:44] <theholyduck> Top lid
[08:07:47] <ButterNoodle> they only have one job
[08:07:52] <theholyduck> Cold air sinks 
[08:07:58] <theholyduck> and less opening
[08:07:59] <ButterNoodle> I have a front loader
[08:08:07] <ButterNoodle> and feet get cold
[08:08:10] <theholyduck> Yeah those are not more energy efficient
[08:08:14] <ButterNoodle> but it beats standing on ur head
[08:08:22] <theholyduck> The chest kind is
[08:08:23] <ButterNoodle> they are only inefficient when opened :)
[08:08:37] <ButterNoodle> I open mine once a week for a bag of coffee
[08:08:54] <theholyduck> Ok sure but the chest kind doesn't drop its cold air on the floor
[08:09:06] <theholyduck> So it's more tolerant of it
[08:09:54] <ButterNoodle> I'm 193cm... I aint bending over into a chest freezer all invitingly
[08:10:07] <ButterNoodle> literally stand on my head
[08:10:17] <theholyduck> Lol
[08:10:29] <ButterNoodle> *not arguing the efficiency, but the convenience

[08:30:39] <amigojapan> Ok hard brunch
[08:30:44] <amigojapan> Had
[08:31:41] <amigojapan> I think it is going to be hard to have said that she not get a joke about being hard
[08:35:08] <jessedesu_onaph> Benis
[08:36:02] <amigojapan> I knew it
[08:36:56] <Nanobot> I had to give Maromi a joke without a superchat. I feel so dirty.
[08:37:37] <Nanobot> She turned off superchats because she's been having breathing problems, and superchats startle her and cause her to have coughing fits.
[08:38:28] <Nanobot> This was my joke: Bees will finish making their honey before winter starts. Right now, the bees are preparing. You can call it a June bee.
[08:38:32] <amigojapan> "Benis¬†(Persian: ÿ®ŸÜ€åÿ≥‚Äé, pronounced [b√¶ÀàniÀês]; Azerbaijani: Bennis) is a rural village in Guney-ye Sharqi Rural District, in the Central District of Shabestar County, East Azerbaijan Province, Iran
[08:39:45] <amigojapan> Like June bride? Nanobot 
[08:40:20] <amigojapan> Junbi
[08:40:23] <amigojapan> I see
[08:40:56] <Nanobot> It tooks Maromi and the people in chat a bit to get it, too. I thought it would be pretty obvious.
[08:40:58] <Nanobot> *took
[08:42:45] <Nanobot> I'm not sure if I misheard, but I thought Maromi just referred to a character as "oppai"
[08:42:46] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle not yet, just finished making a smoothie 
[08:42:47] <amigojapan> Nanobot: it's good that she still reads your jokes even if superchat is bit involved
[08:43:28] <amigojapan> Nanobot: an anime character?
[08:43:31] <Nanobot> As soon as I posted the joke, she knew it was a joke and said she'll read it when the game gives her a chance.
[08:43:43] <Nanobot> Whenever I post a lot of text, it's bound to be a joke
[08:44:10] <Nanobot> She's playing Ragnarok Origin, and there was a female character who had sorta big boobs. But everyone looks a bit chibi.
[08:44:12] <amigojapan> Nanobot: now you are obliged to post jokes
[08:44:37] <MootPoot> theholyduck:  nice hat
[08:46:02] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle:  that video is kowaii
[08:46:28] <amigojapan> MootPoot: which video?
[08:46:38] <MootPoot> the motorcycle video
[08:46:47] <amigojapan> I missed it
[08:49:05] <amigojapan> MootPoot: it seems he does not crash, why do you think it is kowai?
[08:49:24] <MootPoot> it says he almost crashed
[08:49:30] <MootPoot> the point is he came close to crashing
[08:50:01] <amigojapan> MootPoot: ah ok
[08:51:23] <amigojapan> I watched it without audio MootPoot 
[08:52:01] <MootPoot> start watching at 5:30 and look at the bike ahead of him 
[08:52:07] <MootPoot> the video rewinds a few times so you can see
[08:53:30] <amigojapan> Ok MootPoot let me see
[08:56:05] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I see where it rewinds but I don't hear anything about a crash. I think he said "I was losing it

[09:06:49] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: like real mail, not email?
[09:06:56] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: that's kind of weird at this point
[09:07:00] <MootPoot> woah
[09:07:03] <MootPoot> interesting
[09:07:12] <MootPoot> amigojapan:  so I just measured with my Qi fast charger
[09:07:12] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: snail mail
[09:07:27] <MootPoot> its 15w charging, but my phone reports 1350mah charge
[09:07:34] <MootPoot> and the pad+phone gets somewhat hot
[09:07:41] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: so I'm trying to define tsuushin for myself, kind of a broad word. Do you think "communication via technology" is fair?
[09:07:49] <MootPoot> !c 1350/1500
[09:07:50] <ImoutoBot> MootPoot: 0.9
[09:07:52] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I'd count smoke signal or whatever as technology too
[09:07:59] <MootPoot> ~90% efficency?
[09:08:17] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: but snail mail is technology?
[09:08:44] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: yes, in the broad sense I think of
[09:08:50] <MootPoot> idk, its just a logistics system...I dont think its a technology per say
[09:08:51] <amigojapan> MootPoot: getting hot sounds bad
[09:09:09] <amigojapan> Ok TsundereNoises 
[09:09:11] <MootPoot> well, its not HOT, its just noticably warmer
[09:09:12] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: like a sword or a clay tablet is also technology
[09:09:23] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: as we should know from book loli
[09:09:23] <MootPoot> so like 10-13C hotter then the rest of the devices
[09:09:45] <amigojapan> Right TsundereNoises . But then almost everything is technology no?
[09:09:52] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises:  but snail mail is like a network not a specific application of a technology or an invention
[09:10:06] <MootPoot> if we phrase it like that you could call a government a technology

[09:12:12] <MootPoot> wtf is my AC not working or is it just that hot
[09:12:30] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: a) you could say that writing the letter is the tech but also b) by that logic the internet isn't technology
[09:12:57] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: also I'm not actually opposed to calling language or democracy forms of technology in some sense
[09:13:16] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: the triplicate form is an excellent technological innovation

[09:15:36] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: hole, beavers, and arguably
[09:15:38] <MootPoot> yeah, but writing a letter, is just a small aspect of the overall concept of a snail mail network. Its not that snail mail is the tech, but its that writing a letter is a tech that enables the idea of snail mail to exist. 
[09:15:46] <MootPoot> thats how it comes to my mind at least
[09:16:06] <amigojapan> Konnichiwa PancakeMatsuri 
[09:16:15] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: so is the internet technology?
[09:16:22] <MootPoot> I'd say no
[09:16:25] <TsundereNoises> or only computers and the internet is incidental?
[09:16:27] <TsundereNoises> that seems wrong to me
[09:16:27] <MootPoot> the internet is an idea
[09:16:30] <PancakeMatsuri> amigojapan hey
[09:16:57] <amigojapan> Hey PancakeMatsuri 
[09:16:57] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: anyway, thanks, I enjoy having these kind of discussions
[09:17:05] <MootPoot> the technology is not the internet, its the physical things that make the internet turn into a real thing we can use
[09:17:54] <MootPoot> similarly I'd argue blueprints and designs are not a technology; I might call them diciplines but them alone I dont think I'd call a tech
[09:18:11] <MootPoot> if I used my toe in the sand to draw a square..that dosen't seem like a tech to me
[09:18:34] <MootPoot> but if I used a pencil to draw it on paper, I used 2 techs ( pencil and paper ) to make the idea of blueprints real
[09:18:59] <MootPoot> brb need to go find a big cup
[09:19:37] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: maybe we don't have such a broad word as tsuushin in English
[09:19:45] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: I actually can't stay online very long anyway, but I'd love to get into this more
[09:20:05] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: well "communication" might be even more broad, right?
[09:20:20] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: because if we have a conversation face to face by talking that's not tsuushin right?
[09:20:23] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: buying from a catalog is ÈÄö‰ø°Ë≤©Â£≤
[09:20:59] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: is ordering from Amazon ÈÄö‰ø°Ë≤©Â£≤?
[09:21:27] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: tomako says she is bit sure about speaking. But I think it is a from of transmission
[09:21:47] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: "bit sure"?
[09:22:05] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: yes it is. But so is a paper catalogue by phone
[09:22:31] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises I meant not* sure
[09:22:58] <TsundereNoises> oh okay, bit sure sounded close enough to a real phrase I didn't parse it as a typo
[09:23:24] <amigojapan> Sorry TsundereNoises 
[09:23:34] * MootPoot has found the problem
[09:23:44] <MootPoot> my portable AC was full of condensed water
[09:23:50] <MootPoot> needed to be cleared
[09:24:51] <amigojapan> MootPoot: be careful that can flood your house
[09:24:59] <MootPoot> its like 100ml lol
[09:25:52] <amigojapan> MootPoot: previous AC was pouring out tones of water. That is why it needed to be replaced
[09:26:10] <MootPoot> I thought ACs need to pour out water
[09:26:19] <MootPoot> if they pour out a lot that just means your air is very humid
[09:26:26] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: tomako just said "communication is ‰ºùÈÅî
[09:27:15] <MootPoot> ahh
[09:27:17] <MootPoot> its finally working
[09:27:19] <amigojapan> MootPoot: yeah. But the exaust piping system was broken beyond repair
[09:27:38] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: yeah I was just responding to your saying there weren't english words that broad
[09:27:59] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I'm more curious if talking face-to-face would count, because that seems weird to me, but I obviously don't really know
[09:28:21] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: sometimes I like to really obsess about a word and try to figure out the nuances
[09:28:31] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: tomako says she is bit sure
[09:28:46] <amigojapan> Not sure
[09:28:51] <MootPoot> I can see the temp dropping on my meter by the miniute 
[09:29:56] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I would like to have a thermal camera
[09:30:16] <MootPoot> you can get small ones that plug into your phone
[09:30:24] <amigojapan> Yeah
[09:30:44] <MootPoot> still 350-400 bucks though
[09:31:04] <amigojapan> MootPoot: yeah that's too much
[09:31:05] <MootPoot> idk you can just get a IR temp gun instead
[09:31:08] <MootPoot> for 20 bucks
[09:31:24] <MootPoot> same idea really, just more pointed in its area
[09:32:25] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: tomako found on the internet this (‰ºùÈÅî„Åô„ÇãÊ¥ªÂãïÈÄö‰ø°„Å£„Å¶Ë®Ä„ÅÜ)
[09:32:58] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: so the act of doing communication is called tsuushin
[09:33:12] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I'm not sure that clarifies anything
[09:33:32] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I think a thermal camera can prevent fires tho
[09:34:02] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: a) that just moves the definition question to a different word, b) at least in English that's exactly the kind of sentence where people get wrong conclusions from dictionaries, so I get nervous
[09:34:30] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I don't have a dog in this fight really, I'm just trying to find TRUTH
[09:34:45] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: but that leads me to being a bit of a devil's advocate
[09:35:01] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: ok. I guess we don't have the answer then
[09:35:17] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: but you can ÈÄö‰ø°„Åô„Çã too, right? so doesn't that just say they're synonyms?
[09:35:22] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: that's fine
[09:35:31] <TsundereNoises> I understand there isn't always a clear answer
[09:36:02] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: ÈÄö‰ø°„Åô„Çãis the verb forms
[09:36:26] <TsundereNoises> ‚Ä¶yes?
[09:36:32] <amigojapan> Without„Åô„Çãit is a noun
[09:36:42] <TsundereNoises> yeah, I don't get what you're trying to say though
[09:37:04] <TsundereNoises> any suru verb is a noun if you take off the suru
[09:37:57] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: I think in general ‰ºùÈÅîis communication and ÈÄö‰ø°is transmission
[09:38:22] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: "‰ºùÈÅî„Åô„ÇãÊ¥ªÂãïÈÄö‰ø°„Å£„Å¶Ë®Ä„ÅÜ" but couldn't you equally say "ÈÄö‰ø°„Åô„ÇãÊ¥ªÂãïÈÄö‰ø°„Å£„Å¶Ë®Ä„ÅÜ"
[09:38:26] <TsundereNoises> ^that's what I was saying
[09:38:43] <TsundereNoises> which was mostly a joke, but also being sad about synonyms
[09:38:55] <amigojapan> I see
[09:39:40] <amigojapan> But communication and transmission are not synonyms
[09:40:22] <TsundereNoises> no, but Amazon isn't a transmission sales site either
[09:40:40] <amigojapan> That is true
[09:40:56] <TsundereNoises> anyway, I was just saying that the definition wasn't really helpful (but is very typical of dictionaries)
[09:41:05] <TsundereNoises> and is something that drives me crazy in english dictionaries
[09:41:15] <amigojapan> I see
[09:42:51] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: my real problem is that I would like a really detailed japanese dictionary, but my japanese is nowhere near good enough for the kind of dictionary I actually like
[09:43:02] <TsundereNoises> and anything I can understand isn't the level of detail I want
[09:43:05] <TsundereNoises> and kind of can't be

[10:03:46] <MootPoot> I just try it all and see if I like it
[10:03:47] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: yes
[10:03:57] <amigojapan> Ah ok TsundereNoises

[10:04:36] <amigojapan> !c 1btc
[10:04:37] <ImoutoBot> amigojapan: I don't know.
[10:04:45] <MootPoot> why is ImoutoBot  broken these days
[10:04:49] <MootPoot> is she ok
[10:05:06] * MootPoot wonders if he can write his own IRC bot
[10:05:07] <amigojapan> MootPoot: Google breakers her
[10:05:10] <MootPoot> I could do it
[10:05:22] <MootPoot> wonder if it would be allowed here
[10:05:24] <Nanobot> I haven't updated ImoutoBot's Google scraper code in a long time. Google frequently changes their code to try to prevent things like ImoutoBot from working.
[10:05:35] <MootPoot> *gasp*
[10:05:42] <MootPoot> google is trying to prevent ImoutoBot  from working?
[10:05:45] <MootPoot> google must die
[10:06:03] <Nanobot> Yeah, because they have paid API for the kinds of information ImoutoBot gathers, and I don't want to pay.
[10:06:06] <TsundereNoises> Nanobot: lately Google has been accusing me of being a bot because I used advanced search terms
[10:07:10] <TsundereNoises> I also love how Google (and all other tech companies) blame you for any possible problem and make it very hard to figure out what could be causing it if it's not you
[10:07:35] <TsundereNoises> ISPs always think your modem is broken, Google always thinks I have malicious scripts querying google
[10:07:47] <TsundereNoises> but they just don't like my using site: or whatever

[10:08:28] <jessedesu_onaph> Did u watch higehiro
[10:08:46] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I recommend one of my students to buy ultrasonic snake repellent. I hope it worked out for her. She is ordering it from the US Amazon
[10:08:50] <TsundereNoises> no, I've gone all season without watching a single episode of anything, including things I know i'd love
[10:09:27] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: she's ÈÄö‰ø°Ë≤©Â£≤„Åô„Çãing it?
[10:09:41] <amigojapan> Yup yup TsundereNoises 
[10:10:02] <MootPoot> wtf
[10:10:56] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: they don't sell it on Amazon Japan
[10:10:56] <Nanobot> TsundereNoises: They must figure that the money they save by reducing the amount of searches from bots is more than the money they lose by inconveniencing users.
[10:11:27] <MootPoot> what is going on
[10:11:28] <Nanobot> Yeah, I actually haven't watched even a single episode from this anime season. It's weird.
[10:11:38] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: give an example of a search that they would flag as a bot
[10:11:39] <jessedesu_onaph> Tsunderenoises do you dislike anime nowadays
[10:11:41] <MootPoot> can magnitism be transmitted through metal?
[10:11:48] <MootPoot> how the fuck
[10:11:54] <Nanobot> The dead anime season early in the pandemic kind of broke my anime addiction. Now, I just have a vtuber addiction.
[10:12:02] <jessedesu_onaph> Can STDs be transferred
[10:12:13] <MootPoot> okay, okay listen guys
[10:12:26] <jessedesu_onaph> Losten
[10:12:29] <jessedesu_onaph> Listen
[10:12:33] <Nanobot> I do intend to watch Villainess, though. And I'm sure I'll go back and marathon some recent series eventually.
[10:12:52] <Nanobot> And I'll definitely watch Bookworm once the new season starts airing.
[10:12:52] <MootPoot> I have a screwdriver with a magnetic tip, a wooden table, and a canadian dollar coin, quarter ( 25c ) coin, and a 10cent coin. 
[10:13:03] <Nanobot> Man, screw drivers.
[10:13:21] <TsundereNoises> Nanobot: I've been watching the summer festival arc in this one really complicated cgi anime...
[10:13:23] <MootPoot> if I pick up the dime (10c) and touch it with the 25c coin, nothing happens
[10:13:24] <MootPoot> BUT
[10:13:34] <jessedesu_onaph> Nanobot, and Grey hounds
[10:13:39] <Nanobot> TsundereNoises: Yeah. I like the part where the girls kissed each other.
[10:13:48] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: if I knew I wouldn't get flagged
[10:14:09] <amigojapan> I see TsundereNoises 
[10:14:10] <MootPoot> if I pick up the dime with the tip of the magnetic screwdriver and then I let the bottom end of the coin touch the 25c coin..it picks up the 25c coin as well
[10:14:16] <MootPoot> how that fuck what the fuck
[10:14:17] <TsundereNoises> jessedesu_onaph: no, I've just been busy + depressed + stressed and end up in this cycle of not watching anime, there are anime I know I'd like this season
[10:14:25] <MootPoot> I've found a glitch in the matrix

[10:15:23] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: magnet polarizes the metal atoms in other metal

[10:15:44] <amigojapan> MootPoot: magnets cause other metals to become magnetic
[10:15:46] <MootPoot> no but its already going through the dime tho
[10:16:05] <MootPoot> so you're saying the magnetic tip is making the 10c turn into a weak magnet which in turn is picking up the 25c?
[10:16:22] <amigojapan> Yes MootPoot 
[10:16:41] <MootPoot> is everything that gets stuck to a magnet also another magnet?
[10:17:00] <Nanobot> Magnets are powered by miracles.
[10:17:07] <amigojapan> MootPoot: also if you rub a magnet against metal. You can cause the metal to become a permanent magnet
[10:17:12] <MootPoot> Magnets, how the fuck do they work

[10:19:25] <Nanobot> <Miko> This will be an epic battle between a devil and a shark! <Gura> Kiss? <Miko> That's fine, too!

[12:42:07] <Sumida> I assume it's the dairy, not the coldness of the ice cream

[12:42:32] <amigojapan> Maybe Sumida 
[12:43:33] <amigojapan> I think when you happen to have diareah and it is also cold in your stomach. It feels worse
[12:44:25] <Sumida> many people don't handle drinking milk very well and blame it on some old superstition?
[12:45:40] <amigojapan> Google sensei seems to agree with Asians "Since immunity decreases with cold temperatures, we should also be aware of infectious digestive ailments with typical symptoms like diarrhoea and vomiting.
[12:46:47] <amigojapan> Seems to be the same reason we get a cold with lower temperatures
[12:47:21] <Sumida> strange that the rest of the planet doesn't have those problems

[15:19:59] <amigojapan> Smartphones did not exist
[15:23:01] <amigojapan> Sumida: can we establish a country where smartphones are illegal?
[15:29:15] <Sumida> what? why?
[15:29:46] <amigojapan> Sumida: I guess we have the Amish

[15:38:20] <amigojapan> Sumida: '‚ÄúCan an outsider join the Amish church/community?‚Äù ... You can begin wherever you are.‚Äù Yes, it is possible for outsiders, through conversion and convincement, to join the Amish community, but we must quickly add that it seldom happens. First, the Amish do not evangelize and seek to add outsiders to their church.
[15:42:27] <amigojapan> Sumida: why do you need IRC when you can socialize in person with other members of the Amish community?
[15:44:29] <amigojapan> Sumida: church is IRC

[16:43:44] <amigojapan> Sumida: I did not even think you liked vtubers
[16:44:55] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: have you thought of just joining the Amish and living a simple life?

[16:45:30] <Sumida> but now I did

[16:46:13] <Sumida> not really
[16:46:20] <Sumida> I'm still not very interested

[16:48:28] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: the Japanese shamans know just what I need to feel normal
[16:48:43] <DunceCotus> then go live as Buddhist monk
[16:48:58] <DunceCotus> (easier done than said)
[16:49:00] <amigojapan> Hmm
[16:49:24] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I don't have anything in principle against that
[16:49:49] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: Buddhist monks can even get married these days
[16:50:24] <DunceCotus> sounds like hobbyist monkhood
[16:51:43] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I go for meditation to a Buddhist temple and the monk there seems to have a complex life
[16:55:18] <DunceCotus> its hard not to in this Day and Age
[16:56:13] <amigojapan> Agreed DunceCotus 
[16:57:14] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: he is a nice guy. And he gives guided meditation for free
[17:03:54] <DunceCotus> fair
[17:08:43] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: which includes tea for free too
[17:09:06] <amigojapan> I don't know why more people don't join
[17:10:30] <DunceCotus> amigojapan it can be difficult
[17:12:01] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: apparently more people join him in the morning meet-up, but nobody else but me goes to the afternoon one
[17:14:40] <DunceCotus> people have 'lives' I guess
[17:14:45] <DunceCotus> whatever that is

[17:22:54] <DunceCotus> however japanese work really long days iirc
[17:23:03] <amigojapan> Yup
[17:24:24] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: Microsoft Japan has been experimenting with a 4 day work week for a long time. And they say "efficiency improved by 40 percent"
[17:25:10] <Sumida> I guess the plan is to work 24 hours of the day but only for 4 days, then coma for 3 days

[17:31:51] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: you don't pay for it. That is what makes it free
[17:32:37] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: I think the owners of graves in the temple pay for things

[17:39:22] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: getting a grave is not free. And recently people just take the ashes to be registered at the temple for a small fee I heard

[17:41:55] <DunceCotus> nothing wrong with a good death
[17:43:38] <amigojapan> Agreed DunceCotus 
[17:43:51] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: in the dream I was happy
[17:45:52] <DunceCotus> I had a really vivid dream last night, just keep going and going
[17:46:46] <DunceCotus> it was like a walk-through rave in the US and it had some kind of VR slide thing.. then there were spiders on one branch of the slide and I woke up cause there was a massive and I mean gargantuan orb-weaver spider

[17:49:38] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: sounds like a nightmare
[17:49:52] <amigojapan> Nyanpasu- HubertFarnsworth o/
[17:50:01] <DunceCotus> amigojapan most of it was pretty benign, it was just the end
[17:50:17] <DunceCotus> amigojapan I needed to piss so maybe my unconscious was trying to wake me up
[17:50:34] <DunceCotus> it sometimes uses bathroom imagery to do that
[17:51:01] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I have often had dreams that I am trying to get out of an endless graveyard
[17:52:05] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I have a rule for myself. If I have a dream where I go to the bathroom. I just get up and actually go to the bathroom
[17:52:31] <HubertFarnsworth> !c specious
[17:52:32] <ImoutoBot> HubertFarnsworth: superficially plausible, but actually wrong.
[17:53:09] <DunceCotus> amigojapan right
[17:53:30] <DunceCotus> amigojapan sounds like graven preoccupation there
[17:56:15] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: in my dreams the toilet is unusable for some reason. Maybe books are stuffed in it or some other reason
[17:56:59] <DunceCotus> o.O
[17:57:25] <DunceCotus> amigojapan I had a dream that featured a bathroom in an alternate universe.. it was weird
[17:57:45] <DunceCotus> there was like a stand-up gas-pump like machine that would electrify your cock
[17:57:50] <DunceCotus> as well as suck out the piss
[17:58:13] <DunceCotus> amigojapan and parts of the bathroom people were sitting around eating while people did their business
[17:58:16] <HubertFarnsworth> it kind of seems like space toilet DunceCotus 
[17:58:35] <DunceCotus> HubertFarnsworth this wasn't in space tho
[17:58:57] <HubertFarnsworth> I see, interesting
[17:59:28] <HubertFarnsworth> no idea what's going on with your subconscious minds
[17:59:52] <HubertFarnsworth> amigojapan: it would be interesting to keep dream journal
[18:00:02] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: I think I know what's going on in mind
[18:00:14] <DunceCotus> HubertFarnsworth after I had that dream I wrote it down immediately
[18:00:19] <DunceCotus> it was rather vivid
[18:00:42] <amigojapan> If the toilet was not unstable for some reason. I would actually pee in real life
[18:00:44] <DunceCotus> HubertFarnsworth also casual nudity was allowed, and it was on a university campus of sorts
[18:01:21] <HubertFarnsworth> I think dreams have something to do with our deepest fears and thoughts which we haven't confronted.
[18:01:40] <DunceCotus> amigojapan maybe your dream self is piss-shy
[18:01:53] <HubertFarnsworth> DunceCotus: I hardly remember my dreams. Don't remember anything now.
[18:02:01] <DunceCotus> HubertFarnsworth strange
[18:02:09] <DunceCotus> but not uncommon it seems
[18:02:36] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I think it is the way of warning me I must actually go to the bathroom
[18:02:41] <DunceCotus> HubertFarnsworth you should take melatonin or GABA
[18:02:47] <DunceCotus> that shit will make you dream lucidly
[18:02:54] <DunceCotus> then maybe more likely to remember them
[18:03:13] <DunceCotus> amigojapan right
[18:03:19] <HubertFarnsworth> let me see if I can remember any dream in the next couple of days
[18:03:42] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: melatonin has side effects and is a prescription medicine in Japan
[18:03:55] <HubertFarnsworth> amigojapan: did you woke up that night and went to bathroom?
[18:04:14] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: which night?
[18:04:32] <HubertFarnsworth> amigojapan: the night you had the dream
[18:05:10] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: you mean about the clogged toilets? Yeah. I have those dreams like twice a week
[18:05:13] <DunceCotus> which night? Green 
[18:06:00] <DunceCotus> amigojapan maybe the clogged means your bladder is full
[18:06:14] <DunceCotus> and you're 'clogging' it to keep yourself from pissing
[18:06:26] <DunceCotus> which has become unconscious so its directly translated into dream imagery
[18:06:43] <amigojapan> Yeah that is what I tried to explain DunceCotus 
[18:06:50] <DunceCotus> ah okay sorry
[18:07:14] <amigojapan> No problem
[18:10:34] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I also often have dreams that I am the only adult in a classroom full of kids
[18:10:52] <amigojapan> And an still going to elementary or middle school
[18:11:06] <HubertFarnsworth> !c acquiesce
[18:11:07] <ImoutoBot> HubertFarnsworth: accept something reluctantly but without protest.
[18:11:08] <Poeticode> galantamine helps with dream lucidity :D is that what GABA is?
[18:11:47] <DunceCotus> Poeticode I don;t think so
[18:12:00] <PretendSurgeon> Poeticode: weren't you Poeticide earlier?
[18:12:03] <DunceCotus> amigojapan Freud thought dreams are all wish fulfilment 
[18:12:20] <DunceCotus> amigojapan its only natural to want to be back in middle school with adult capabilities
[18:12:36] <Poeticode> PretendSurgeon hmm don't recall changing to that nickname but i like the sound of it
[18:13:25] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: maybe because I never really went to middle school or highschool. I just took a GED and for into college
[18:13:30] <PretendSurgeon> Poeticode: heh
[18:13:40] <PretendSurgeon> Poeticode: maybe i mis-read it in the beginning
[18:13:54] <amigojapan> And went into
[18:13:55] <HubertFarnsworth> yo Poeticode, been a while
[18:14:09] <HubertFarnsworth> it's saganman btw
[18:14:21] <DunceCotus> amigojapan well there ya go
[18:14:33] <Poeticode> yooo HubertFarnsworth top o' the mornin' to ya!
[18:14:47] <amigojapan> Yup DunceCotus 
[18:14:51] <DunceCotus> its strange how we treat kids like lepers 
[18:15:14] <DunceCotus> where it would be oh so 'creepy' for adults to be schooled alongside kids
[18:15:50] <HubertFarnsworth> same same Poeticode
[18:16:44] <Poeticode> yeah like in ReLife DunceCotus :(
[18:17:23] <DunceCotus> ReLIFE is a shallow, semi-funny, melodramatic, endearing, irritating, slow-paced, sentimental, mildly engaging, largely predictable, sometimes boring and sparsely‚Äã ...
[18:17:45] <DunceCotus> sounds like a hard sell
[18:17:56] <Poeticode> that's a lot of adjectives!
[18:18:27] <DunceCotus> Poeticode I haven't seen it
[18:19:17] <Poeticode> i watch isekais unironically so i can't sell anything
[18:19:36] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: instead of going to regular school my family let me go to a programming school for adults, since I was 12
[18:19:47] <HubertFarnsworth> I think it's because most don't have patience and energy for kids stuff
[18:20:00] <DunceCotus> amigojapan nice
[18:20:29] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: so I have two degrees actually
[18:21:36] <HubertFarnsworth> In an other news, recreational marijuana is legal in Mexico now
[18:22:30] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: I thought it already was
[18:22:41] <klaxa> only took a hundred years of prohibition
[18:23:07] <klaxa> >tfw you live in the only timeframe of human history where plants are illegal
[18:23:10] <DunceCotus> more reasons to move to Mexico
[18:23:13] <HubertFarnsworth> legally it is no longer criminalized
[18:23:17] <PretendSurgeon> <HubertFarnsworth> In an other news, recreational marijuana is legal in Mexico now <- is it? I thought it was just struck down as decriminalized... like, growing weed is not illegal in Mexico anymore?
[18:23:33] <HubertFarnsworth> legalization bill has to be passed yet amigojapan 
[18:23:40] <PretendSurgeon> ok, so that's what I thought, it's decriminalized, but the legal structure for cultivation/processing/sales is not there yet
[18:24:13] <DunceCotus> hempered by legislation
[18:24:13] <PretendSurgeon> btw for what it's worth, there is a #cannabis (and ##cannabis) here on this network.
[18:24:18] <PretendSurgeon> DunceCotus: yeah
[18:24:28] <PretendSurgeon> haha, "DanceCoitus"
[18:24:42] <HubertFarnsworth> yeah and a new bill will passed to make it legally okay to use recreational marijuana PretendSurgeon 
[18:24:55] <PretendSurgeon> HubertFarnsworth: aye
[18:25:05] <klaxa> haha definitely not a honeypot guys! come to #weed #420 and #dudelmao as well!
[18:25:10] <PretendSurgeon> ;)
[18:25:23] <amigojapan> I see HubertFarnsworth 
[18:25:38] <DunceCotus> if it were a honeypot it would be labelled as such
[18:25:48] <PretendSurgeon> #HoneypotHash
[18:26:31] <PretendSurgeon> ya know with it legal, I can see how cannabis will stop being a big issue
[18:27:00] <PretendSurgeon> like how hemp became legal, and now no one hears about it that much
[18:27:22] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: Mexico is a very liberal country. Also before France and USA they legalized gay marriage
[18:27:36] <PretendSurgeon> and how marriage between two dudes / two women became legal by the Supreme Court ruling, and now what used to be called "Gay Marriage" in the US news media, is now just "marriage"
[18:27:40] <HubertFarnsworth> Nice amigojapan

[18:36:46] <HubertFarnsworth> The government will earn a lot of income by legalising.
[18:37:13] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: normal stores like coffee shops will sell it
[18:37:44] <DunceCotus> amigojapan doesn't mexico have an equivalent to FDA?
[18:37:56] <DunceCotus> surely it would have to pass certain testing standards
[18:38:04] <DunceCotus> and that requires legislation of its sale
[18:38:05] <HubertFarnsworth> Lol amigojapan, that is kind of odd. Your local coffee dude selling weed.
[18:38:06] <amigojapan> Not sure DunceCotus 
[18:38:36] <DunceCotus> Im sure they could get around that by giving it a euphemism instead of actively advertising they are selling weed
[18:38:44] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: I think that is what it is like in the Netherlands
[18:38:51] <DunceCotus> that's what they do here with synthetic weed (nasty shit)
[18:39:50] <HubertFarnsworth> Is the second hand smoke of weed harmful to other?
[18:39:55] <MootPoot> PretendSurgeon: At least in the US it's still called gay marriage though when it is discussed in politics

[18:43:18] <HubertFarnsworth> is it like cigarette smell?
[18:43:42] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: hard to explain

[18:44:53] <Sumida> he said yoroshiku
[18:45:15] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: very strong green grass smell
[18:45:24] <HubertFarnsworth> or one of those tobacco those rednecks smoke, that's worst

[18:47:23] <Sumida> more like burning a pine tree with weird things than grass
[18:51:36] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: anyway it is a very strong smell. Like peppermint is strong smell
[18:53:22] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: stronger than tobacco
[18:53:34] <HubertFarnsworth> I see amigojapan 
[18:55:02] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: and if they are smoking "blunts"it is mixed with tobacco

[19:03:28] <Poeticode> actually i guess fentanyl is where it's at now
[19:03:45] <PretendSurgeon> amigojapan: that's what they are doing with taxes
[19:03:48] <PretendSurgeon> with high taxes.
[19:03:55] <PretendSurgeon> $50 an ounce, ya kidding me??
[19:04:12] <amigojapan> I see PretendSurgeon 
[19:05:20] <amigojapan> PretendSurgeon: that leaves space for criminals to undercut the legal price
[19:06:46] <Poeticode> the tax surcharge is well worth knowing exactly what's in the product you're buying imo
[19:07:04] <amigojapan> PretendSurgeon: I guess you will be allowed to grow your own
[19:07:27] <amigojapan> Agreed Poeticode 
[19:07:35] <PretendSurgeon> amigojapan: that should be at a minimum, I would think
[19:07:59] <PretendSurgeon> amigojapan: some states in the US which have legalized its sales, still criminalize home-grow
[19:08:17] <amigojapan> I see PretendSurgeon 
[19:08:41] <PretendSurgeon> Poeticode: oh I agree that standardization and testing is paramount, for a product that people are going to be breathing into their lungs
[19:09:26] <PretendSurgeon> but the black market will continue as long as that price difference between legal & black market weed remains big

[20:52:54] <Bco1981> ;)
[20:53:03] <Bco1981> 2400G isn't supported
[20:53:17] <Sadale> ah.
[20:53:27] <Sadale> That's weird.
[20:53:54] <Bco1981> yeah, but that' their new feature, that requires some TPM 2.0 feature
[20:54:15] <Sadale> Bco1981, I thought that TPM existed in older zens.
[20:54:15] <Bco1981> and they have cut support for cpu's older then 3 years.
[20:54:53] <Sadale> I suspect that it's more about marketing and less about technicals. They want people to upgrade their computer maybe?
[20:55:25] <Sadale> And I'm worried that this strict security requirement would prevent dual boot from working at all.
[20:56:02] <Bco1981> they probably need that tpm 2.0 for some shit app that they think is necessary... but obviously isn't.
[20:56:45] <Bco1981> like they say that later, a webcam will be a requirement...
[20:56:53] <Sadale> I still believe that it's about marketing, or they have some kind of financial incentive to do that.
[20:56:58] <Bco1981> and off-line accounts is no more.
[20:57:03] <Sadale> woah.
[20:57:04] <Sadale> I hate it
[20:57:10] <Bco1981> this is where they lost me.
[20:57:11] <Sadale> Good bye windows 11.
[20:57:22] <Sadale> Tha'ts bullshit. PC ain't smartphone
[20:57:27] <Bco1981> exactly
[20:57:33] <Sadale> I miss Windows XP
[20:57:40] <Sadale> And Windows 7 too.
[20:57:48] <emmeka> lol, mandatory webcam for your OS to work?
[20:57:50] <Sadale> These smartphone crap started getting introduced since windows 8
[20:58:11] <Bco1981> you can still get it, and run it... and you will be free from discord... because that can't install on windows 7 anymore.
[20:59:00] <Sadale> discord must die :P
[20:59:00] <Bco1981> it requires some patch for windows 7... that M$ removed from their site.
[20:59:34] <emmeka> I've been linux only since Vista days. Glad I did, as every time I hear about the new and innovative ways Windows finds to suck, I don't understand how people put up with it.
[20:59:50] <Sadale> Bco1981, found an interesting comment online. "I bet Intel would (might) have paid a pretty penny to Microsoft to institute such a policy. They were looking at losses of overall sales (Apple is shifting off Intel) and of course the consumer business market should be cooling down after the lockdown is over with AMD in a much stronger position. This is made to order for Intel really."
[21:00:08] <emmeka> converted my wife recently too, now that she's seen the amount of linux compatible games on Steam is past a majority now
[21:00:55] <Bco1981> Sadale: lol, interesting indeed.
[21:05:23] <Nanobot> Bitcoin has entered the June 15 OTE short zone. Hasn't yet hit the AB=CD target of $37k.
[21:06:27] <HubertFarnsworth> Is OTE Zone the time to buy Nanobot?
[21:06:49] <Nanobot> OTE short zone is the time when people will be selling. Elevated chance of the price dropping from there.
[21:06:56] <Nanobot> OTE long zone is when people will be buying.
[21:07:10] <HubertFarnsworth> I see.
[21:10:07] <Nanobot> The reason I'm focusing on this movement is there's a lot of harmonics going on. AB=CD leading to a nice round number within an OTE short zone, which if it becomes point C in a larger AB=CD, would lead right into a major OTE long zone that the price has been flirting with for over a month.
[21:10:22] <Nanobot> That OTE long zone is where I want to do some buying.
