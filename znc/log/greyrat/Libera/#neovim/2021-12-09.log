[01:56:41] <sunjonSenghanBri> I think you're perhaps mixing terminology too
[01:57:02] <sunjonSenghanBri> but only because it's a very common thing to do for new-ish users
[01:57:34] <sunjonSenghanBri> do you want to go to a previous buffer, or a previous window?
[01:58:35] <sunjonSenghanBri> do you want to toggle between last and current? (as after the switch, current becomes last - no?)
[01:58:44] <sunjonSenghanBri> or do you want to maintain a history like <C-o> does?

[04:00:27] <ii14[m]> there are of course defaults that work, but you might want to spend some time with configuring nvim lsp client to your liking, while coc will just work

[04:40:59] <JieruMei[m]> Thanks for the hint.
[04:41:34] <ii14[m]> I don't know if it's not redundant, but it won't hurt to try
[04:41:45] <ii14[m]> with vim.defer_fn
[04:41:59] <ii14[m]>     Note: The {fn} is |schedule_wrap|ped automatically, so API functions are

[04:42:03] <ii14[m]> yes, it is
[04:42:42] <JieruMei[m]> The `defer_fn` doesn't work as the time to wait is undetermined

[07:46:57] <qastokes> Dunno where or how exactly to ask this question, but getting a dedicated linuxbox soon & my big project is to import all my notes into a cleaner focused environment (not windows) to edit them together into a book. maybe a million words across all the platforms stuff is written on. No idea how to approach this, thinking of using some form of revisioning system. Code and  text documents are similar, same tools for both would be nice. 
[07:46:59] <qastokes>  New to poweruser style workflow, love it, love the ease and elegance of the unix cli environment, neovim and everything else. Open to suggestions and thoughts. Thx.
[07:54:05] <smultron> qastokes: i have yet to use it myself, but i hear good things about this note-organizing app https://obsidian.md

[08:03:17] <qastokes> Smultron thanks, looks interesting. Graph view is neat as an organizational conecpt, and Markdown is the superior editing environment.  and a phone app!
[08:03:54] <rendakuenthusias> I use this software: https://joplinapp.org/
[08:03:57] <rendakuenthusias> it's open source, unlike obsidian
[08:04:13] <rendakuenthusias> it encourages a slightly different model of note organziation
[08:04:28] <qastokes> That is a major downside.
[08:04:40] <rendakuenthusias> I've tried obsidian briefly but I really don't like that closed soruceness of it
[08:04:42] <rendakuenthusias> otoh I know people who swear by it
[08:04:53] <rendakuenthusias> there are some quirks of joplin's UI I dislike, but on the whole it works for me

[13:26:18] <monkoosemonkoose> treesitter noob here, can someone explain in few words or point to some resource for my questions
[13:26:18] <monkoosemonkoose> i have `nvim-treesitter` and `nvim-treesitter/playground`
[13:26:18] <monkoosemonkoose> What playground is showing is actual tree from parser right? But it doesn't include some highlighting staff like operators, braces etc, that are defined in query files like here https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-javascript/blob/master/queries/highlights.scm but how it is different from regex syntax then? Any explanations?
[13:29:14] <ii14[m]> well it's ast so it won't tell you literally "this an equality symbol". it will be something more like `(compare (node a) (node b))`
[13:29:18] <osa1merSinanAaca> How do I debug this now? I'm trying `nvim -u ...` but that seems to disable plugins too.
[13:29:27] <ii14[m]> I don't know a lot about treesitter either btw
[13:29:56] <ii14[m]> but I think the regexes in the file you included are applied just to match symbols
[13:30:08] <ii14[m]> not as a parser
[13:30:12] <monkoosemonkoose> @osa1 do you have monolit config?
[13:33:09] <osa1merSinanAaca> @monkoose It's single file, yes
[13:33:12] <monkoosemonkoose> because i have splitted my config, so i can comment out some `requires` in the `init.lua` or just `nvim -u path/to/plugis.lua`
[13:33:51] <monkoosemonkoose> then just comment out everything but plugins staff
[13:33:55] <osa1merSinanAaca> Even with all of my config commented out it doesn't work. So strange.

[17:19:00] <clason[m]> I mean, it fits the label: a matchit implementation based on tree-sitter
[17:19:10] <clason[m]> of course, it cannot escape the limitations of the base technology (which you would like)
[17:19:29] <clason[m]> but since the creator is one of the main nvim-treesitter devs, this is as close as you will get
[17:19:43] <clason[m]> so it's very much worth studying his solution
[17:20:02] <monkoosemonkoose> for me 1 file that would be injected into every other enabled parsers would be much better solution then creating queries with one line `inherit foo` for every filetype you want to support, but this assumptions from a noob that doesn't know treesitter internals at all, so if this isn't allowed by default there should be a reason i guess
[17:20:15] <clason[m]> yes
[17:20:48] <clason[m]> that's why I'm saying that if you're serious about having a discussion about this, you need to understand the playing field
[17:21:55] <monkoosemonkoose> you talked about this plugin right https://github.com/theHamsta/nvim-treesitter-pairs
[17:21:55] <clason[m]> for example, there's a reason that queries are special-purpose instead of a big ball of regex and syntax groups like in vim's default syntax files; that is critical for performance

[17:33:15] <dundargoc> Aka a map like table

[17:35:31] <dundargoc> Aha, so the difference isn't in the data structure itself but how the information is processed.
[17:35:32] <monkoosemonkoose> nope it would be `vim.tbl_extend('keep', {1,2}, {3,4,5}) == {1,2,5}` obviusly i think
[17:35:41] <dundargoc> s/information/data/
[17:37:07] <bfredl> yes, though is many context "map-like table" implies string keys (like anything involving json, msgpack, api or vim script)

[17:55:19] <dundargoc> Or rather: how TF does neovim define a list?
[17:55:37] <monkoosemonkoose> only integer keys i think
[17:55:42] <monkoosemonkoose> it can nest

[21:42:36] <clason[m]> yeah, telescope has a lot of things going for it, but performance over FZF is not one of them
[21:43:07] <han-`> sigmasd[m]: is your preview window taking up the full screen? you don't have a list of filenames?
[21:43:40] <han-`> you might look at the configuation for the preview window if that's the case

[21:48:27] <sigmasd[m]> It happens when the search string is long, the name of the file is initially at the left of the window but when the line gets long it gets shifted out of the screen

[21:54:12] <sigmasd[m]> han-`: thanks!!
[21:54:12] <monkoosemonkoose> There is option for preview window that can keep N number of top lines something like `--preview-window '~2'` to always show top two lines, but then you need to show some information at the top of previewer. `bat` can show it with `bat --style=header,numbers /path/to/file`
[21:54:23] <kylo252[m]> <sigmasd[m]> "It happens when the search..." <- fwiw, the same problem happens with telescope. that's why I opted for the `get_ivy` style because it gives you more real-estate. 
[21:54:23] <kylo252[m]> that said, it's a `ripgrep` setting that you can toggle if you'd like. I don't think it's that easy to do it on the fly tho
[21:55:02] <sigmasd[m]> It doesnt happen that offen so han-` suggestion is perfect for my usage
[21:55:13] <sigmasd[m]> Thanks for all your help!
