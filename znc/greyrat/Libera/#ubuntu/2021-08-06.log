[00:12:44] <alzgh> tomreyn the keyid for `apt-key del` is the 8 last characters of the fingerprint that you get from `apt-key get`. That's kinda weird bc one expects it to be the first characters. But you probably know that already :]

[00:29:57] <tomreyn> alzgh: you can actually pass the whole fingerprint (which is the safest approach). the last 8 characters are the "short key id", this should no longer be used, it's insufficiently unique, because a key with the same short key id can be generated on demand. then there's the "long key id", last 16 characters of the fingerprint, this is currently being used to identify keys where it does not seem necessary to match the full fingerprint.

[00:54:43] <EandC> The machine is running 18.04 with a fully encrypted drive, but can't boot after I've unlocked the drive. I've tried using an older kernel from GRUB's advanced settings page thing, and the same thing results. I tried using recovery mode to fix things and that still hasn't helped. I moved into root and mounted the LVM, etc, proc, and all of that and tried a dist upgrade, but still nothing. Right now I have a black screen with a flashing

[01:04:13] <tomreyn> EandC: apparently it's related to kernel modules, probably third party kernel modules, posing problems. does this ring a bell in terms of recent changes you made? the best way to recover from this is probably a chroot from a current 18.04 LTS live / installer system
[01:04:29] <EandC> Yeah, doesn't seem like a LiveUSB install will play nice with the existing system in any way

[01:05:51] <tomreyn> do you know that you're using out of tree modules, though?
[01:05:58] <EandC> so I think the bad block messed something up, and then I might've troubleshot myself into a worse situation?
[01:06:34] <tomreyn> you'll rarely ever have a single bad block, and if you have any, you really should replace the disk asap
[01:07:33] <EandC> Yeah, fortunately I was already doing a backup when this happened. I just wanted to see if I could snag a few more files before runnigng diagnostics on it and then sending it in for RMA

[02:12:33] <solar_sea> Hi. I am trying to boot a 20.04 server lts image written with the rpi imager to a headless rpi 4. It successfully gets an ip from my dhcp server but it seems that its sshd is disabled as I cannot open a shell to it (ssh times out). Is there a way to make it send its console over tcp ? I would really like to avoid plugging in a monitor and a keyboard. Thanks!

[03:40:03] <SnoopJ> I don't recall doing anything with groovy since this install was brand-new. I did do some mix-and-match on the previous (eoan) install because I was trying to get to gcc-10. It went poorly, but the upshot is that I'm no longer running a deprecated release :)
[03:40:35] <tomreyn> yes, you're now running two recent releases

[03:43:24] <tomreyn> i'm not sure what those nvidia repositories provide, which seem to be made for ubuntu 18.04 LTS - those might introduce dependency issues as well
[03:44:15] <SnoopJ> I think that's for libnvidia-container-tools, for GPU pass-through.

[06:03:23] <tomreyn> i'm not sure i'm seeing the explanation of why the SRU was strictly needed - I assume it is FTBFS (fails to build from source), i.e. important other packages would fail to build without gcc 10.3

[06:14:43] <SnoopJ> I tried with = before, not sure what the difference is between : and = but neither works.
[06:14:54] <SnoopJ> Which I assume is because the package is for groovy, and my deb against it is for focal.

[06:15:25] <leftyfb> oh right
[06:15:46] <leftyfb> I think if it's showing up in apt-cache policy then it should be available to install
[06:16:06] <SnoopJ> hmm, if my deb in that PPA includes groovy, I get unmet dependencies, but maybe I can do that dance since I am already pretty sure those packages are stable on this system.

[06:16:40] <tomreyn> i will give up on this. one possible "solution" is to grab the 20.04 packages off archive.ubuntu.com as i explained above, but you'll need to find them on your own, and verify the downloads.

[06:18:12] <sarnold> leftyfb: heh, sorry, I should have used more words :) I thought that the : was for releases, and = was for specific versions
[06:18:19] <SnoopJ> if I could figure out how to get just the relevant packages from hirsute, I'd feel more comfortable with that. I don't know how apt spells that, though.

[10:27:13] <alkisg> What's the output of `dpkg -l | grep -i virtualbox` ?
[10:27:50] <TheBigK> was virtualbox not part of ubuntu 18.04?
[10:28:53] <guzzlefry> TheBigK: It was, but LTSs tend to keep really old package versions.
[10:28:56] <alkisg> If I understood correctly, he installed virtualbox.deb from upstream, and he wants to switch to virtualbox from ubuntu
[10:29:06] <guzzlefry> correct
[10:29:14] <TheBigK> and thats not the case anymore?
[10:29:30] <alkisg> Eh, 2020 is more recent than 2018 :)
[10:29:45] <TheBigK> thats correct... but its not gonna be recent in 2022 :D
[10:30:16] <guzzlefry> I think it is in this case. Still 6.1 iirc?
[10:30:36] <alkisg> I'm using the stock one, 6.1.22-dfsg-2~ubuntu1.20.04.1, works fine
[10:30:58] <guzzlefry> Virtualbox is slow to bump minor versions. So it works out in this case.
[10:32:04] <TheBigK> guzzlefry: pls pastebin dpkg -l virtualbox* | grep ^ii
[10:32:11] <alkisg> They made an exception for firefox, to allow frequent updates for security reasons. They should have made some more exceptions, for libreoffice, virtualbox and a few other big programs
[10:32:33] <TheBigK> alkisg: thats what snap is for
[10:33:00] <alkisg> TheBigK: snap install virtualbox works?! I doubt it
[10:33:06] <alkisg> Snap solves a problem that I don't have :D
[10:33:34] <alkisg> My first command after installing *ubuntu is apt purge snap...
[10:33:42] <TheBigK> alkisg: thats not the fault of ubuntu. if u dont like the solutions ubuntu gives u, u should switch ;)
[10:33:48] <guzzlefry> https://dpaste.org/UuPe
[10:34:03] <guzzlefry> Going to take a guess and say that I was looking for virtualbox-6.0 instead of just virtualbox. :P
[10:34:14] <alkisg> TheBigK: nah, as part of the community, I have offered thousands of hours to make ubuntu better, so I get to voice my complains while I still keep using it
[10:34:26] <alkisg> It's not a company effort, it's a community effort
[10:34:30] <TheBigK> remove that package and install virtualbox-dkms and may be virtualbox-ext-pack and may be also virtualbox-guest-additions-iso virtualbox-6.0
[10:35:12] <guzzlefry> What's dkms?
[10:35:12] <TheBigK> alkisg: i dont mind u complaining. thats freedom of speak. but there are tons of solutions for such easy problems
[10:35:17] <alkisg> apt install virtualbox should pull in virtualbox-dkms etc
[10:35:48] <TheBigK> i would switch to debian if i would use LTS...
[10:36:16] <alkisg> I'm using many distributions in many places, each one has its pros/cons
[10:36:24] <TheBigK> i agree
[10:36:32] <guzzlefry> hrm, can't resolve ubuntu.com
[10:36:48] <TheBigK> :D
[10:36:51] <alkisg> But some solutions are good, others are bad; using dnsmasq for dns was a bad solution, so I criticized it until ubuntu did remove it; sometimes they do hear back from users
[10:37:17] <alkisg> criticize = file bug reports with arguments and all, I don't mean here in irc
[10:37:20] <TheBigK> im not using dnsmasq?!
[10:37:29] <alkisg> You all were, in 16.04
[10:37:39] <alkisg> It was shipped as part of network-manager dns resolution
[10:37:57] <alkisg> And it was breaking people that actually wanted to use dnsmasq for their own needs
[10:37:58] <TheBigK> okay. could be true :)
[10:38:15] <alkisg> Anyway, that one was solved, and also unity, upstart, bzr etc got better solutions...
[10:38:20] <TheBigK> im using dnsmasq on my pi... for pihole
[10:38:38] <alkisg> Hopefully snap will also go away in 5 years; I'll do some patience until then :D
[10:39:01] <TheBigK> i doubt that this is gonna happen... although i think flatpack is a better choice
[10:39:39] <alkisg> We had 10+ different package managers in Linux, and the solution they came up with was to introduce 3 more ones
[10:39:44] <alkisg> (flatpak, snap, appimage etc)
[10:40:04] <alkisg> How would libreoffice be able to ship upstream packages then, with all that chaos...

[21:38:53] <ubottu> webchat52: Ubuntu version numbers are: YY.MM (YY=release year,MM=release month). Each year sees two releases, so just specifying YY is imprecise. See also https://www.ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle

[21:39:23] <webchat52> yes, sorry
[21:40:41] <tomreyn> i haven't used the desktop installer for so long that i don't remember whether it can install across more than one disk. have you tried manual partitioning, yet?
[21:41:13] <leftyfb> webchat52: the easy way to install ubuntu on the first HDD and then mount the 2nd as /home for your files and settings. If you really only want the 1st for "boot", then you probably want the entire OS on the 1st and then an overlayfs on the 2nd

[21:44:41] <leftyfb> webchat52: yup, you can deal with that with custom partitioning and then setup either the /home mount or overlayfs after the fact
[21:44:48] <webchat52> because, at the moment, my first hd is used for winboot only, and the second one for programs, files, etc

[21:45:37] <tomreyn> sharperguy__: can you share the certificate (it's public anyways) on a pastebin?

[21:46:12] <tomreyn> i've not seen this before, but maybe i missed something

[21:48:16] <lotuspsychje> worth a try
[21:48:19] <SnoopJ> Lesson learned, the installer offers a promise about the partition that is a little stronger than what it delivers
[21:48:25] <SnoopJ> lotuspsychje, I don't think you understand: I have already recovered the data.
[21:48:32] <lotuspsychje> kk
[21:48:37] <tomreyn> sharperguy__: chances are openssl still accepts the certificate in this format, but java's certutil doesn't (which would explain that only the java tool tells you it's an error)
[21:48:51] <SnoopJ> The fact that I had to recover it in the first place when the installer told me it would only delete things in system directories is...annoying.
[21:49:13] <SnoopJ> but lot of room for subtle failures there, probably the user (i.e. me) did something silly
[21:49:19] <sharperguy__> @tomreyn, https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/hrwG7qKKHd/ - its because its in a signed message format

[22:16:57] <apb1963> leftyfb, there was no option.  I did nothing special - other than selecting a custom partition config. I allocated 50GB for the root, and made /home a mount point  Then I installed to the new, blank, unformatted drive.
