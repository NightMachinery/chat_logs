[11:34:25] <bagder> if only
[11:37:40] <bch> hello #curl -- I've got a C/portability question thats not _directly_ curl-related if that's fine... 
[11:37:48] <bagder> sure
[11:37:53] <bch> hey bagder 
[11:38:20] <bch> it's re: ssize_t -- which I found it is not in C std, but is POSIX, and Windows doesn't support it.
[11:38:46] <bagder> ah that one
[11:39:14] <bch> in curl it looks (based on my quick search) ssize_t is #defined based on _WIN32 (alone (?), no _WIN64?)... 
[11:39:37] <bch> > ah that one ... heh.
[11:40:22] <bagder> well, win32 means windows in curl, so it's defined on 64 bit too
[11:40:50] <bch> so, I don't doubt that curl works -- so q: did I miss anything, or is windows predicable enough to just #define ssize_t long (or whatever I saw in one place) or is there some other place where heuristics are applied ? 
[11:41:11] <bagder> it is safe to make it long on Windows
[11:41:15] <bagder> I think
[11:41:18] <bch> bagder: right -- I get _WIN32 == all windows, and _WIN64 narrows it down to 64bit platforms... 
[11:41:25] <bagder> and on windows, long is the same size as int ...
[11:41:45] <jfuller> build, test and scan ... seems like we do not have to bump alpine this time around
[11:41:49] <jfuller> proceeding with multibuild
[11:42:09] <bch> I'm just working on converting size_t -> ssize_t in another project thats casing -1 into size_t, because it makes my skin crawl.
[11:42:12] <bch> :/
[11:42:37] <bagder> hehe, I agree that such things aren't very nice
[11:42:39] <bch> ...but I do need to handle more than just POSIX... notably Windows.
[11:42:58] <bch> its funny to look at it in *nix.
[11:43:55] <bch> eg I believe write(2) will take a size_t object to write out, and return the results in ssize_t -- halving its resolution, because it needs to be able to send -1 to signal error.
[11:44:28] <bch> various platforms say you may need to "interpret" the ssize_t (iirc).
[11:45:10] <bch> Linux says it'll take a size_t to describe what to send, but it'll silently not even bother sending the "top half" of a size_t value, so it won't overflow the ssize_t return code... 
[11:45:22] <bch> all interesting and educational... 
[11:45:53] <bagder> I suppose 4GB buffers aren't terribly common anyway
[11:45:58] <bch> agreed.
[11:47:26] <bch> the platforms that said ssize_t might be overflowing seemed to make sense to me now (based on my memory) technicall incorrect (the best kind of incorrect(?)) because ssize_t is only guaranteed to hold values -1 to SSIZE_T_MAX; which is to say, not the whole gamut of negative numbers, just -1.
[11:48:05] <bagder> plus it says it says "the number of bytes written is returned"
[11:48:32] <bagder> so using other negative numbers wouldn't help
[11:48:37] <bagder> it can't really write negative amounts
[11:49:18] <bagder> so easiest fix is to never try to send larger buffers than a ssize_t can hold
[11:49:41] <bagder> then there should be no risk of integer tricks
[11:50:48] <bch> right --- I read a few BSDs and Linux and perhaps some others... digging into this minutae gave me little bits of knowledge that I should keep in my head and re-read all the man pages again to make sure I didn't misunderstand or misread what I thought I saw the first time wrt potential negative numbers, or at least resolving the size_t/ssize_t tension... 
[11:52:18] <bch> bagder: yes -- and that's what Linux clearly does -- I guess the _caller_ might supply a SIZE_T_MAX object, but Linux won't actually attempt to write that... only writing out "SSIZE_T_MAX", and reporting that... so the caller can arrange to send the back-half of their object when they do their error checking... 
[11:52:43] <bagder> right, which seems like a reasonable approach
[11:53:14] <bch> so anyway -- Curl just tests for _WIN32 in one place to define ssize_t ? 
[11:53:47] * bch using curl as a voice of reason here
[11:54:50] <bagder> this is the primary logic curl uses on windows: https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/lib/config-win32.h#L328
[11:55:17] <bagder> so I was slightly wrong, it is a 64 bit type for 64 bit windows
[11:56:11] <bch> right -- we were both wrong... that's indeed where I landed in my earlier search though, so thats good.
[11:56:52] <bch> very good. I'm going to use this as a reference. Ty for the chat @bagder :)
[12:05:50] <bagder> https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2022/03/10/deprecating-things-in-curl/
