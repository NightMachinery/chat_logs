[01:24:19] <d_bot> <cemerick> I ended up having a use case for cram-style tests, and ocaml-mdx + dune worked out nicely üëç
[01:25:21] <d_bot> <cemerick> It looks like the original cram tool is basically unmaintained, it might be a good opportunity to offer up ocaml-mdx as a supported alternative, if it could grow a frontend separate from dune: https://github.com/brodie/cram/issues/35
[01:26:10] <rgrinberg> mdx and cram have a different syntax so it isn't a drop in replacement
[01:26:27] <d_bot> <cemerick> it seems to have a cram-compatible mode tho?
[01:27:39] <d_bot> <cemerick> Requires the use of an undocumented --syntax option: https://github.com/realworldocaml/mdx/tree/main/test/bin/mdx-test/expect/cram
[01:27:42] <rgrinberg> I'm not aware of it. I know it can embed cram tests inside sh sectinos
[01:29:21] <rgrinberg> Is that still recommended to use? I think they are mostly switching to dune's cram implementation
[01:31:03] <rgrinberg> Leonidas ?
[01:32:15] <d_bot> <cemerick> @rgrinberg dunno, I learned about ocaml-mdx first while searching for a maintained cram impl üôÉ

[06:42:12] <hornhack> how do I init an array with 2 elements fast?
[06:42:37] <hornhack> I know I can Array.create ~len:1 x if it has 1 element
[06:43:12] <companion_cube> ~len:2 ought to work?
[06:43:35] <hornhack> companion_cube, ehh, but 2 different elements
[06:44:18] <hornhack> maybe I need to create a list then Array.of_list?
[06:44:36] <hornhack> sounds troublesome
[06:45:27] <companion_cube> [| a; b |]
[06:46:07] <hornhack> wah is that possible
[06:46:13] <hornhack> let me try that, thanks
[06:47:41] <d_bot> <NULL> Array.create is deprecated (it is in the Stdlib, it should also be in Base)
[06:48:03] <d_bot> <NULL> Use Array.make instead (it should have the same signature)
[06:48:03] <companion_cube> it's Array.make anyway
[06:49:30] <hornhack> I found Array.create okay in Base, there is no Array.make in Base
[06:49:44] <hornhack> or am I reading the old version
[06:50:07] <hornhack> its 0.13
[06:54:00] <hornhack> wow 0.14 exists
[06:54:48] <hornhack> still no Array.make tho

[09:27:33] <d_bot> <Curzon> I wonder when OCaml will have built-in cross compilation
[09:27:57] <d_bot> <Curzon> A lot of other languages like Rust, Go, etc have some sort of cross compilation or their interpreter is cross-platform
[09:29:05] <d_bot> <Curzon> I know the `opam-cross-windows` but that only worked for one ocaml version lol, other versions would error. It wouldn't work in WSL either, it just wouldn't work, some assembly error or something I don't remember.
[09:29:41] <d_bot> <Curzon> I don't get why OCaml has no cross-compilation, though?
[09:30:14] <d_bot> <Curzon> Oh wait yeah, because it only generates assembly for linux and mac?
[09:30:26] <d_bot> <Curzon> And that unix is also required (for now)
[09:31:17] <d_bot> <Curzon> I really like OCaml, but I just don't want to be relying on js_of_ocaml for cross-platform stuff yk
[09:31:54] <d_bot> <Curzon> Excuse my complaining, I just hoped that one day ocaml has built-in cross compilation, all im asking for üôÇ

It's not a ton of work, but the compiler wasn't built with it in mind.

[22:25:14] <companion_cube> there are bindings to tensorflow, is all I know
[22:25:24] <companion_cube> you probably want to talk to the GPU anyway
[22:31:50] <mouseghost> hm
[22:31:57] <mouseghost> i thought about doing it all by myself...
[22:36:03] <companion_cube> look at bigarray then, for float arrays
[22:36:09] <companion_cube> (or Owl but it's not "doing it all by yourself")
[22:37:55] <mouseghost> thanks
