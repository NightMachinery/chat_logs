[14:08:53] <dpk> yes, i realized after asking that there are CL obsessives out there who simultaneously believe they have risen to the top of the Blub pile and also that algebraic data types, static type checking, optional types, dependent types, persistent data structures, hygienic macros, etc etc are all just weird stuff they don't need
[14:09:40] <jackdaniel> that's quite a condescending opinion
[14:10:02] <dpk> mine or theirs?
[14:10:15] <moon-child> both?
[14:10:54] <jackdaniel> well, you've put some rude stuff into mouth of some imaginary people and then generalized it for quite large community
[14:10:57] <jackdaniel> so I'd say - yours
[14:12:01] <dpk> my point is that Blub is not a linear spectrum in any case — different languages are powerful in different ways — and in particular that a language that stopped significantly evolving 35 years ago and thus has not really benefitted from those 35 years of PL research has no real chance of being the full-stop one-and-only most powerful/advanced/whatever language anyway
[14:12:32] <jackdaniel> well, then you should probably complain to paul graham who coined the term
[14:12:54] <dpk> some non-imaginary people who have said basically this: Doug Hoyte
[14:13:49] <dpk> Erik Naggum, also
[14:13:51] <jackdaniel> I'm not going to follow this line of argumentation. I understand that you hold some grudge, still what you've said was condescending and a harmful generalization

[15:44:21] <Andrew> So a problem here: I've played with Common Lisp for a few months now, using everything available in clisp and sbcl.  Now I installed 'birch' with Quicklisp.  How do I use it? 
[15:44:41] <Andrew> Seems to be a pretty basic question, pretty surprised that the online guides are quite vague

[15:45:33] <Andrew> For some reason I didn't install CLisp on this machine yet, now I'm compiling it, I'll see how it goes with CLisp instead of SBCL

[15:47:56] <Andrew> <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11171558/how-to-use-packages-installed-by-quicklisp> ut you should somehow load it every time you start your Lisp system. ASDF provides a means to define a dependency on CL-PNG system, so that you can just load only your own system, and all of the systems it depends on will be loaded automatically, making available all packages you want to use.
[15:48:00] <Andrew> (As an example for cl-png)
[15:48:05] <mfiano> Andrew: You might get better help in the CL channel.

[18:06:45] <wasamasa> lol
[18:07:03] <wasamasa> if you cannot comment out (/ 1 0), it's not a sexp comment
[18:07:16] <wasamasa> clojure has #_, some schemes have #;
[18:07:26] <phoe> #+(or) (/ 1 0) does not signal an error

[18:09:36] <wasamasa> why not #+nil (/ 1 0)

[18:10:03] <jackdaniel> ditot, it is not semantically correct

[18:10:21] <wasamasa> and this gentlemen, is why CL will never win any codegolf contests
[18:10:24] <jackdaniel> in practice many people write #+nil
[18:10:58] <jackdaniel> I don't understand, but I'm not playing golf either so I don't know the requirements

[18:11:42] <wasamasa> it's really easy, write as few characters as possible to solve the task at hand
[18:12:16] <jackdaniel> then why would you add a form comment?
[18:12:46] <jackdaniel> as I said, I may miss some crucial knowledge about golf, I don't even have sticks to hit the ball
[18:12:53] <wasamasa> my point is that worrying about correctness won't win you such a contest

[19:54:32] <ASau> wasamasa: yes.
[19:54:35] <wasamasa> ok
[19:55:18] <ASau> White_Flame: Axiom uses either Scratchpad or, in very special cases, Aldor, both are heavily typed.
[19:55:48] <SR-71> Well you can theoretacally create your own dilect of lisp whenever you want. 
[19:56:07] <SR-71> So... It's recursive
[19:56:17] <ASau> Scratchpad is based on System F, so you can get feeling what it is when your typing system is weirder than one that allows Hindley-Milner inference.
[19:56:55] <ASau> White_Flame: Maxima and Reduce use custom languages that are essentially Lisp, only with Algol-like syntax.
[19:57:24] <ASau> Or you can break out and have underlying Common Lisp for Maxima or Standard Lisp for Reduce.
[19:58:30] <ASau> Otherwise, both have stronger and weaker areas, with Reduce usually weaker due to being less widespread.
[19:58:53] <ASau> (Mostly because of being opensourced a lot later than Macsyma.)

[20:08:25] <White_Flame> right.  I think the closest environment that we have nowadays is actually the web browser console.  All GUI elements are live objects that can be directly interacted with, and the entire webpage state is exposed to the developer.

[20:17:29] <holycow> open genera is what it is because of the time it was born in where it had a chance to be born out of the leading edge hardware research
[20:18:04] <White_Flame> but modern OSes and their interoperability constrain what we can reasonbly do without reinventing the entire universe
[20:18:07] <holycow> it isn't like you can't get open genera style environments right now and just leave out the kernel and hardware level stuff out of it, let other people handle that burden
[20:18:29] <SR-71> I think we should contribute to mezzano
[20:18:32] <White_Flame> oh, you mean do something like that in userspace?  yeah, I agree.  mcclim is enabling that
[20:18:38] <SR-71> And hopefully it gets mainstream.
[20:18:43] <SR-71> lol
[20:18:45] <holycow> it isn't even its just one option
[20:18:51] <holycow> i'm running stumpwm
[20:19:22] <White_Flame> I don't like X11, so I'm not really interested in interfacing with it
[20:20:05] <holycow> anyone that says they don't like x11 has read too much propaganda.  i don't know anyone that actually knows anything about x11 outside of what they read
[20:20:39] <holycow> the mcclim window manager doors that just popped up looks fun
[20:21:27] <holycow> but really, if someone were to write a display manager in lisp, use a lisp window manager and then use all lisp userspace apps, you can do what opengenera did and then some
[20:21:58] <SR-71> And hopefully write an api for the kernal in lisp
[20:22:18] <holycow> i would say that would probably the best way forward
[20:22:20] <White_Flame> SR-71: heh, you have a c64 background?
[20:22:43] <SR-71>  White_Flame: Not really.
[20:22:53] <White_Flame> ah, that's the only place I've seen it spelled "kernal"
[20:23:04] <SR-71> lol
[20:23:15] <SR-71> what else do they spell it?
[20:23:20] <White_Flame> kernel is standard
[20:23:30] <White_Flame> "kernal" ends up being a bit of a shibboleth

[20:44:57] <holycow> if we had a lisp display manager + lisp version of arcan (arcan-fe.com) + lispwm + nyxt ... how many more bits and pieces would be required to mostly get opengenera style userspace environment?
[20:46:20] <holycow> the part that i don't fully understand is why no one has gotten raw lisp code running on bare metal like a raspberry pi outside of froggey

[20:51:23] <jackdaniel> from practical point of view you may start making a desktop on linux in clim and then add the operating system

[20:53:16] <ASau> From more practical point of view, you can "chsh" and start adapting all scripts and programs you're using immediately.
[20:53:20] <holycow> the thing that could pull a whole bunch of things together is building something like fossil-scm.org which would provide the bare bones spine of what you get in opengenera with its integration + versioning filesystem except we push the versioning into a simple scm
[20:53:23] <jackdaniel> even better, it had running c applications (vua iota, also made by froggey - llvm->cl transpiler)

[20:59:20] <holycow> but yes i agree.
[21:00:51] <White_Flame> IMO, one major thing I'm waiting on is beach's first class environments.  Then you can actually more safely run more things in a single shared space
[21:01:11] <White_Flame> without dealing with OS process separation, the lame shell interface, etc
[21:01:54] <ASau> Frankly speaking, I'm not sure about all those.

[21:11:17] *** Quits: SR-71 (~user@user/SR-71) (Remote host closed the connection)
[21:11:29] <holycow> there is an xkcd of that idea.  first panel: security problem, all apps can access each others data.  middle pannel: put all apps in virtual machines, find out you cannot do anything now.  last panel:  all virtualized apps are now networked so you can share data between them and you are now back at square one.
[21:12:08] <holycow> it's kind of a good question about how a single user environment should work.  what does it mean for an app to be isolated.
[21:12:37] <holycow> i mean android does it but i think it only works on android because that is used to consume media and that is about it.  no one actually does anything useful on android.
[21:13:23] <White_Flame> an interesting but difficult to define boundary is that intentional user actions can do anything, but "program code" should be limited
[21:13:33] <ASau> 'Cause people with money use iPhone? :D
[21:13:44] <White_Flame> things are often the complete opposite of that, with DRM etc, disallowing user actions but allowing machine actions
[21:15:15] <holycow> and it gets worse than that.  i wish i can find the video.  there was a persentation recently about how irrelevant the linux kernel is on modern hardware
[21:15:30] <holycow> the basic idea is that on a modern computer system, the kernel doesn't even talk to the hardware at all
[21:15:33] <holycow> like at all
[21:15:35] <holycow> instead
[21:15:45] <holycow> it talks to a bunch of apis that the hardware presents to the kernel
[21:16:12] <holycow> where the hardware it self contains a whole ton of other operating systems sitting on bits and  piece sof hardware, and a lot of it in tiny virtual machines
[21:16:49] <holycow> all kinda pretending the x86 interface is a universal language through which the kernel talks to the hardware
[21:17:01] <holycow> let me see if i can find it, it was fascinating
[21:17:53] <holycow> oh and the reason for moving code to hardware is partly because they now can and don't have to shove it into the kernel side of things and there is less friction for vendors to just chuck shit into their hardware than push things out to the kernel teams and deal with those politics
[21:17:54] <White_Flame> the relevancy of the kernel is the permission boundary
[21:18:28] <White_Flame> by "code in hardware", you mean firmware x86 code on peripherals that the CPU executes?
[21:18:29] <ASau> I don't get how it differs from old way when you were communicating to some controller using funky protocol.
[21:18:43] <holycow> yes correct
[21:18:47] <White_Flame> *stored on peripherals
[21:19:21] <White_Flame> yeah, and that sort of stuff really needs its own sandboxing
[21:19:43] <White_Flame> and would ideally have some form of CPU-independence, sort of like the forth-based BIOSes
[21:20:17] <holycow> the core point of the video is that a linux os on bare metal isn't on bare metal at all.  it is actually virtualized away by hardware into it's own little bubble, and the shit that happens underneath the kernel we have NO CLUE about
[21:20:19] <ASau> (EFI?)
[21:20:53] <White_Flame> holycow: yep, ASau: eufi?
[21:22:10] <ASau> holycow: I still don't understand how that differs from old times when you were sending data into I/O ports and reading something back.
[21:22:42] <White_Flame> ASau: you're not blindly executing native code on your main CPU.  with a protocol, the commands are processed on a foreign chip
[21:22:45] <ASau> You have never been fully informed what the hell is going on on the other end of the wire. 
[21:23:17] <White_Flame> the other end of the wire ideally woudln't have access to your RAM
[21:23:31] <ASau> DMA is very old invention.
[21:24:04] <holycow> ASau: old hardware did not have entire operating systems virtualize on chip.  Perhaps it is a difference of degree i guess.  Looking for the video, they made the point way better than i can.
[21:24:08] <ASau> Not to mention that a lot of CPU families don't have separate I/O address space like Intel's.
[21:25:46] <ASau> holycow: AFAICR, last Palms were explicitly emulating old hardware on newer CPUs for economical reasons.
[21:26:06] <White_Flame> yes, ARM emulating 68k
[21:26:27] <White_Flame> but the OS and many applications were native ARM, it basically had "rosetta" for backwards compatibility
[21:27:20] <ASau> Software emulation of "newer" CPU instructions is not a new invention either.
[21:28:06] <ASau> (I'm not going to be surprised, if it pre-dates 360/370 even.)
[21:28:56] <White_Flame> the primary point holycow was making is that the cpu is blindly executing machine code blobs from arbitrary sources, with no real control, sandboxing, etc of what that code does
[21:29:27] <White_Flame> whereas things like supporting multiple ISAs, handling invalid instruction traps, etc are all integrated in the OS itself
[21:30:00] <White_Flame> the former is a huge safety & stability concern
[21:30:55] <ASau> I understand concern, I don't understand how it differs from "good old days".

[21:32:36] <holycow> how about trying to explain it like this
[21:33:03] <ASau> holycow: hence quote marks ;)
[21:33:20] <holycow> in the good old days you weren't literally virtualized away from the hardware.  you didn't have control over what happened on the other end of the wire but really you weren't virtualized away from the hardware
[21:33:40] <holycow> so like this conversation that is happening here?
[21:33:45] <White_Flame> and what happened on the other end was often very documented
[21:33:55] <ASau> Hrm!
[21:34:19] <holycow> i have something i call a hydra server.  it is a box with debian on it.  i have a bunch of virtual machines running on it simultaneously, some of them desktops, all with direct hardware passthrough.
[21:34:21] <ASau> In many cases when it was documented the actual behaviour didn't match.
[21:34:23] <holycow> this conversation?
[21:34:42] <holycow> this is not happening on the hardware.  it's in a virtual machine, because my desktop is a virtual machine fully accelerated.

[21:35:39] <holycow> i happen to be root for both layers but really, i'm mostly not there i only work in my virtual machines because its super convenient having my os as one giant file i can copy / paste anywhere i have access to qemu.
[21:35:46] <White_Flame> what do you mean by direct hardware passthrough?  each has its own video card, etc?
[21:36:03] <ASau> The "other end" could as well be another full-blown CPU that was reading the same RAM.

[21:39:27] <holycow> good old days was a few lines of machine code doing specific things
[21:39:44] <ASau> When?
[21:40:00] <holycow> good new days is the firmware has evolved to entire layers of intelligence controlled by someone else

[21:45:53] <ASau> Why is that important in principle?
[21:45:53] <holycow> you can literally take all the code out of all the controllers, open it up, put it in the kernel and let the kernel do the work
[21:45:56] <holycow> or
[21:46:04] <holycow> you can put it on the controller and abstract away the kernel
[21:46:17] <holycow> its a bidirectional consideration, no?
[21:46:24] <ASau> Yes, you can, but then you just have to use CPU cycles to do what controller could do in parallel and independently.
[21:46:30] <ASau> Perhaps, more effectively even.
[21:46:39] <holycow> yes of course, that was the point of the video.
[21:47:21] <White_Flame> modems vs winmodems.  postscript printers vs rastering drivers.  etc
[21:47:23] <holycow> you can make the peripherals raw and put the code in the kernel (open sourced) and we have full control
[21:47:26] <holycow> or
[21:47:42] <ASau> Given what CPU cycles cost in comparison to slower peripheral hardware, the more code goes to periphery the better.
[21:48:03] <holycow> you can move code into firmware in which case you get a situation of multiple intelligences all acting in concert with their own needs, wants and concerns that are outside of the scope and control of the kernel
[21:48:18] <holycow> conceptually this couldn't be simpler, i'm not sure what the confusion is.
[21:48:37] <holycow> forget the economics, we know why firmware exists

[21:59:00] <ASau> I need to leave.
[21:59:26] <White_Flame> it is a spectrum, as both do need some form of driver
[21:59:32] <ASau> Won't be back in at least few hours.
[21:59:51] <White_Flame> a periphal running its own code does not give the CPU any code to run
[22:00:11] <White_Flame> I don't know how much simpler that can be, this is obviously not an idea that you're either aware of, or can communicate well
[22:00:49] <holycow> spectrum <-- that is the key word
[22:00:53] <ASau> The closes thing that comes to mind right now is bank-switching hardware of the past.
[22:01:28] <White_Flame> think of a 6551, it doesn't need to give a ROM to the CPU to drive a rs232 port
[22:01:54] <White_Flame> vs some chip that's just a physical interface and gives a ROM to CPU for software to bit-bang the protocol
[22:02:15] <ASau> Ah, that...
[22:02:22] <ASau> Alright.
[22:02:29] <White_Flame> what else could it be?
[22:03:00] <ASau> At least I understand what you mean, and why it is such a big concern to you.
[22:03:13] <ASau> Now I've left for real. See you later.
[22:03:43] <White_Flame> but both need to be aware of how to drive the chip, hence a spectrum
[22:04:01] <White_Flame> erm, in both circumstances, there needs to be OS-side code to drive the chip, regardless of its style
[22:05:32] <holycow> ASau: also, stop worrying about what people find important
[22:05:44] <holycow> no one has either said nor even implied what they find important
[22:06:36] <White_Flame> I've certainly stated that machine code needs to stop being the primary form of software deliver :-P
[22:06:38] <White_Flame> +y
[22:06:44] <holycow> its just interesting to note the status of what it means to be a user on a machine that is, over time, trending back to being a time share user on your own box
[22:07:05] <holycow> ha!
[22:08:18] <White_Flame> of course one of the simplest issues is that it mandates legacy CPU ISAs and makes hardware non-portable
[22:08:36] <White_Flame> in terms of the firmware driver situation
[22:11:13] <holycow> some people think we yearn for the days of this: 

[22:11:25] <holycow> hehe
[22:11:54] <White_Flame> I'm still an active commodore 64 developer, but that's hobby & challenge.  Real computing environments are a different ball of wax
[22:12:10] <holycow> dude *high five* 
[22:12:11] <holycow> respect

[22:12:20] <White_Flame> I certainly don't yearn for my _entire_ computing experience to be 8-bit laissez-faire
[22:12:27] <holycow> you release games for the c64 community still?
[22:12:36] <holycow> heh me neither
[22:12:42] <White_Flame> nah, just tools & hobby coding
[22:12:51] <holycow> cool
[22:15:36] <White_Flame> punched tape is still pretty cool, though.  the tangibility of old computing is neat
[22:16:13] <holycow> i love exploring the old stuff.  when i learned about multix and how unix came about my mind was blown
[22:18:44] <mfiano> multics?
[22:19:18] <holycow> inspiration for unix.  unix came about as a hacking idea inspired by multics
[22:19:40] <holycow> https://www.multicians.org/
[22:19:45] <mfiano> yes i was wondering if you typo'd or were referring to something i never heard of
[22:19:57] <holycow> ah, nope. apologies.
