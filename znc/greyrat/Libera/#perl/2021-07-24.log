[21:42:19] <StayHungry> print(join '-', reverse split /-/, '23-07-2021'). how come statements are written backwards? why not thing to process and then how to process it as follows ('23-07-2021', split /-/, reverse, join '-')

[21:43:25] <Grinnz> functional programming style: the innermost functions run first
[21:43:47] <Grinnz> print(join('-', reverse(split(/-/, '23-07-2021')))) is another way to write that
[21:44:10] <thrig> see also FORTH and such languages
[21:44:28] <Grinnz> it's not really running in reverse, just the inner arguments have to resolve first
[21:46:24] <StayHungry> Grinnz: with those round brackets is makes more sense (to me, at present), thank you
[21:46:33] <Grinnz> the way to write it in the order of processing would require a object-oriented paradigm, like '23-07-2021'->split(/-/)->reverse->join, which you can do with Mojo::ByteStream for example, it just looks a little different because it can't use split's special parsing: b('23-07-2021')->split('-')->reverse->join
[21:47:29] <StayHungry> wow, it looks friendlier this way :)
[21:47:40] <Grinnz> unfortunately, it's a lot slower
[21:47:53] <Grinnz> objects and method calls have overhead in perl
[21:48:06] <Grinnz> but the difference won't matter until you are doing it a lot
[21:48:19] <thrig> or "23-07-2021".split("-").reverse.join("-").say in some language that shall not be named
[21:48:44] <Grinnz> there's also autobox which lets you do it without the initial b(), but that's even slower
[21:49:23] <StayHungry> thrig: looks like Ruby, or JS if we add () after reverse :D
[21:50:11] <StayHungry> Grinnz: object-style would require adding use Mojo::ByteStream; i guess, right?
[21:50:16] <Grinnz> yes
[21:50:24] <thrig> it is not ruby nor javascript
[21:50:27] <Grinnz> to use that module's version of it

[23:52:19] <Grinnz> StayHungry: the problem with that general practice, aside from the problems with globally setting state that affects what happens in CPAN modules, is that a piece of code often depends on exceptions preventing the following code from executing; e.g. 'die "bad arguments" unless defined $foo; do_stuff_with($foo)'
[23:52:51] <Grinnz> if you cause that die to ignore the exception, then it suddenly executes something with an undefined $foo that the code assumed was not possible
[23:53:29] <Grinnz> so the try/catch or eval mechanism lets you ignore or handle them at a higher scope, where you can make a different assumption about what happens next
[23:54:39] <Grinnz> it's a bit different in a shell like powershell, because those are meant to execute a series of commands and may or may not handle whether they succeed
[23:55:00] <Grinnz> perl is not a shell, and needs consistent behavior
[23:58:05] <StayHungry> already installed DateTime, because TimePiece is unable to handle "middle ages". but then it turned out that DateTime::Format::Strptime is not a part of DateTime, but another module. before that i had file.pl with various date conversion examples. if module is not installed, i would prefer to output error and everything what works without interruption. had to eval {} manually.
