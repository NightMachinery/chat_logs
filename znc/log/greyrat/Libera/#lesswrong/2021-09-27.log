The conference seemed
[01:50:49] <feepbot> like a (wildly successful) effort to contribute to the ongoing normalization of the subject. Offer people free food to spend a few days talking about autonomous weapons and biased algorithms and the menace of AlphaGo stealing jobs from hard-working human Go players, then sandwich an afternoon on superintelligence into the middle. Everyone could tell their friends they were going to
[01:50:49] <feepbot> hear about the poor unemployed Go players, and protest that they were only listening to Elon Musk talk about superintelligence because they happened to be in the area. The strategy worked. The conference attracted AI researchers so prestigious that even I had heard of them (including many who were publicly skeptical of superintelligence), and they all got to hear prestigious people
[01:50:54] <feepbot> call for “breaking the taboo” on AI safety research and get applauded. Then people talked about all of the lucrative grants they had gotten in the area.

[03:14:40] <feepbot> simplify this: simply define the image tokens as the concatenation of low to high res. then to do curriculum training, you simply truncate the sequence at a particular resolution. it also would help global coherency while generating images because it'll generate a, say, 32x32 seed, and then say a 128x128 larger version, then a 1024x1024 based on that. this would speed up runtime
[03:14:40] <feepbot> too because you could generate just the 32px seed version and display that to users, and only upscale on demand.

At the time of the death of King Francis I in 1547, the work had cost 444,070 livres.[18] The château was built to act as a hunting lodge for King Francis I;[5] however, the king spent barely seven weeks there in total, that time consisting of short hunting visits. As the
[04:58:39] <feepbot> château had been constructed with the purpose of short stays, it was not practical to live in on a longer-term basis. The massive rooms, open windows and high ceilings meant heating was impractical. Similarly, as the château was not surrounded by a village or estate, there was no immediate source of food other than game. This meant that all food had to be brought with the group,
[04:58:39] <feepbot> typically numbering up to 2,000 people at a time. As a result of all the above, the château was completely unfurnished during this period. All furniture, wall coverings, eating implements and so forth were brought specifically for each hunting trip, a major logistical exercise.

[07:32:02] <Robomot> Petrov Day 2021: Mutually Assured Destruction? - LessWrong 2.0 viewer [dxu 26 Sep 2021 22:16 UTC 2 pointsParentThis is an interesting comment …] (Today we celebrate not destroying the world. We do so today because 38 years ago, Stanislav Petrov made a decision that averted tremendous calamity. …)
[07:32:05] <catern> it's like... going to a wedding and saying "you're statistically likely to be divorced soon" or going to a religious funeral and saying "there's no afterlife"
[07:33:38] <catern> maybe the funeral is a worse example, but the wedding is a good example; it's spoiling a symbol, just to be edgy
[07:34:13] <quanticle> Everything about this thread is cringe
[07:34:16] <quanticle> >HPMOR and the sequences were pretty profound influences on my development.
[07:34:20] <saturn2> i'm glad someone who wasn't me pushed the button
[07:34:44] <shawwwn> saturn2: did you have a code?
[07:34:45] <feepbot> shawwwn: shawwwn left a note 1 days, 35 minutes ago: hi I still love you :)
[07:34:46] <quanticle> Okay, the sequences, sure, but HPMOR? If HPMOR was "a major influence on your life" you have no business writing a line like, "Go outside or something"
[07:34:55] <shawwwn> :) at least someone does
[07:35:21] <saturn2> shawwwn: no. i got one every year before but i guess they tightened things up due to the 2020 incident
[07:35:28] <shawwwn> Ah
[07:37:32] <saturn2> but i think the petrov day game is probably teaching people bad ideas, while also definitely being cringe
[07:38:06] <Obormot\Gaia> I got a code
[07:38:23] <Obormot\Gaia> Wait that was last year
[07:38:36] <Obormot\Gaia> Wait so what happened this time
[07:38:40] <Obormot\Gaia> Or has it not happened yet
[07:39:40] <saturn2> it's only 100 people this time, and the button destroys EA forum (with a button on EA forum that destroys LW)
[07:40:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hmmm
[07:40:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> How did they choose who got it
[07:40:44] <saturn2> it sounds like they manually picked people
[07:40:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> I think I should've gotten it
[07:40:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> I have a proven track record of not doing anything bad with it
[07:41:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> And I'm obviously extremely trustworthy and a morally upright person in general
[07:41:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is a slap in the face
[07:42:17] <nshepperd> you're definitely in the top 100 obormots
[07:42:39] <quanticle> nshepperd: Yes, that's the problem
[07:42:48] <quanticle> We need *at least* one hundred more Obormots
[07:43:15] <quanticle> >I think the audience seeing this comment is heavily self selected to care about the Petrov day celebration and think it’s good and important. These present core LWers risk severely underestimating how off-putting this stuff is. How many people would be interested in participating in this community, constructively, if the vibes were a little less weird. These people, unlike me, mostly don’t
[07:43:15] <saturn2> they should have just reminded us that we died and have been dead since 2020. that should be the petrov day celebration imo
[07:43:16] <quanticle> care enough to rock up and criticize.
[07:43:18] <quanticle> The weird vibe is the point! The Petrov Day celebration is a filter, not an advertisement. The fact that it's driven people like you away from the community is the filter working as intended.
[07:43:59] <adiabatic> that _particular_ Petrov Day celebration is a filter
[07:44:24] <adiabatic> saying "happy petrov day" on your twitter account is an advertisement
[07:44:28] <adiabatic> both are useful
[07:44:52] <adiabatic> I think I have a PDF somewhere of some super-solemn petrov day celebration. I think it involves candles
[07:45:25] <adiabatic> personally, I'd go with the more jewish "we almost killed us / we didn't / let's eat"
[07:45:49] <saturn2> that's probably http://petrovday.com/
[07:45:49] <Robomot> Petrov Day
[07:45:52] <quanticle> Christianity was *such a mistake*
[07:46:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes
[07:47:41] <adiabatic> yeah, that looks like it
[07:47:44] <adiabatic> needs TLS and dark mode
[07:50:09] <adiabatic> quanticle: but: bacon cheeseburgers
[07:51:53] <quanticle> adiabatic: I commend you on your ability to find a foodstuff that offends my and Obormot's heritage equally
[07:52:08] <adiabatic> I aim to displease.
[07:52:48] <adiabatic> …although if I were to do it _equally_, it'd be a cheeseless Slater's 50/50 half-bacon hamburger.
[07:52:52] <quanticle> Lots of people *say* they're equally opportunity offenders, but they don't walk the talk. But adiabatic is the real deal
[07:57:39] <shawwwn> “Once the vector is read into a stream register it is a stream and is “flowing” in the given direction in the following sense: Given spatially-adjacent functional slices at coordinates x0 , x1 , x2 (where the spatial coordinate increases in the direction of flow), then at a given time ti, the vector representing stream s1 at slice x1 can be accessed as operands by that slice. Similarly, the slices at x0 and x2 will have access 
[07:57:40] <shawwwn> to different stream values for the same stream register. In the following cycle ti+1, the value s1 either propagated to the functional slice at x2, or else it is overwritten with a result r1 produced by the slice at x1 at cycle t. Similarly, the stream value s0 that was present to be consumed by the functional unit at coordinate x0 at time ti will be (absent x0 overwriting the value at time ti) available in the next cycle ti+1 to 
[07:57:40] <shawwwn> the slice at x1. Stream operands are steered toward the slice that is consuming them and producing a result stream. Streams are constantly flowing across the chip, serving as the means by which slices communicate with one another. Figure 4 provides a graphical depiction of the interleaving of functional units and stream registers that combine to support this programming model.”
[07:58:08] <shawwwn> This is gonna be “fun” to figure out
[07:58:16] <shawwwn> I feel like it was written to be intentionally opaque
[08:00:11] <shawwwn> (https://groq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ISCA-TSP.pdf)
[08:00:55] <adiabatic> shawwwn: it sounds like code translated into English rather than an English description
[08:01:10] <shawwwn> Yeah
[08:01:17] <shawwwn> At least it’s precise
[08:01:36] <adiabatic> hixie got into that sort of description style when he was writing the HTML5 spec
[08:01:42] <adiabatic> although this is too Englishy to be as good

[08:05:20] <shawwwn> The main thing I’m trying to figure out is how much total memory is available in a groq chip
[08:05:34] <shawwwn> They say 220MiB at one point
[08:05:42] <shawwwn> But 220MiB seems ludicrously small
[08:05:53] <shawwwn> So I feel like I’m misreading
[08:08:49] <quanticle> gwern: https://web.archive.org/web/20120503151237/http://bostonreview.net/BR31.1/hansonbenforado.php Cthulhu?
[08:08:50] <Robomot> Boston Review — The Drifters (Since 1975, an award-winning forum for political, cultural and literary ideas.)
[08:12:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Bacon cheeseburgers are not bad but a bit overrated
[08:12:49] <shawwwn> This part is kind of interesting “Large scale deployments within warehouse-scale computers [11] require hardware-based error correction when possible to be resilient in the face of transient errors. The error correcting code (ECC) used to protect vectors in SRAM memory is also used as they flow on the stream registers on-chip. Since the memory system is highly banked and replicated, we want to avoid replicating the XOR-tree for 
[08:12:49] <shawwwn> computing ECC across a wide, 128-bit, memory word. Instead, we take advantage of the producer-consumer nature of the stream programming model and generate ECC check bits only at the producer and they are stored alongside the 128-bit memory word as 9-bit ECC, 137- bits in total. The ECC scheme implements SECDED (single- error correction with double-error detection) to allow us to tolerate a single-bit error in the memory word or 
[08:12:49] <shawwwn> anywhere along the streaming data path. When a functional slice is going to operate on a stream, ie. consume a stream, it will check the ECC bits to ensure data integrity before operating on it. This mechanism covers both the SRAM soft errors, any datapath soft errors that might arise in the stream registers.”
[08:13:00] <shawwwn> It’s equally impossible to understand, but interesting
[08:18:34] <shawwwn> lol, signal is down
[08:18:47] <shawwwn> https://status.signal.org/
[08:18:58] <feepbot> Signal Status
[08:19:19] <shawwwn> okay, I'll just talk about it out loud here until people can't stand it
[08:19:39] <shawwwn> The instruction control unit (ICU) provides explicit instruction fetching with IFetch, and inter-slice synchronization using Sync and Notify instructions to perform a chip-wide barrier synchronization among participating functional slices. A repeated-NOP (no-op) instruction allows for precise cycle-by-cycle control of inter-instruction delay; for example, the compiler has cycle-accurate control when scheduling two operations A and B 
[08:19:40] <shawwwn> using an intervening NOP so that N cycles separate them OpA NOP(N) OpB.
[08:19:46] <adiabatic> and then will you keep going or will you stop
[08:20:03] <shawwwn> yes
[08:20:38] <shawwwn> okay so this is just saying, each instruction is scheduled at specific cycles by padding it with NOPs
[08:21:05] <shawwwn> 2) A vector execution module (VXM) consists of a 4×4 mesh of ALUs in each lane for point-wise arithmetic operations.
[08:21:33] <shawwwn> this is where I need to back up and ask "what's a lane?"
[08:21:34] * shawwwn scrolls up
[08:21:58] <shawwwn> "The tensor stream processor architecture makes several deliberate tradeoffs on the hardware-software interface, ..." blah blah
[08:22:18] <shawwwn> • 320-lane programming abstraction overlaid on the TSP block diagram (Figure 5) where each tile in the on-chip mesh operates on 16-lanes in a SIMD manner. We refer to this 16-lane unit as a “superlane” which is a cross-section of all the functional slices on the chip and the minimum granularity of computation. As such, a superlane represents the architecture’s minimum vector length, minVL, of 16 elements. Likewise, the 
[08:22:18] <shawwwn> vertical composition of 20 tiles to form a functional slice (Figure 5) produces a maximum vector length, maxVL, of 20×16=320 elements.
[08:22:26] <nshepperd2> this is an exposed pipeline processor?
[08:22:43] <shawwwn> I have roughly zero hardware experience, so I don't even know the answer to that question
[08:22:48] <shawwwn> it's https://groq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ISCA-TSP.pdf
[08:22:57] <PapuaHardyNet> tensor processors?
[08:23:23] <shawwwn> Data parallelism for each slice’s SIMD execution is provided via a programming abstraction called parallel lanes. These parallel lanes correspond to elements of data vectors, an abstraction common to many ML frameworks like TensorFlow [2]. In the TSP model, instructions flow Northward from the ICUs to the functional slices, while data (operands and results) flow East and West between functional slices. Any inter-lane data movement 
[08:23:23] <shawwwn> within a vector uses the on-chip network (SXM) slice.
[08:24:05] <quanticle> I think it's just the standard overrating of anything having to do with bacon.
[08:24:05] <shawwwn> > instructions flow Northward from the ICUs to the functional slices, while data (operands and results) flow East and West between functional slices.
[08:24:05] <PapuaHardyNet> I see, you are looking at groq chips.
[08:24:31] <shawwwn> instructions flow northward = time flows northward, I think
[08:24:39] <shawwwn> and east and west would be the parallelism between chips
[08:25:48] <shawwwn> > As shown in Figures 1 and 5, the on-chip network is implemented as X-dim mesh and Y-dim mesh of tiles with X-YX dimension order routing. Each instruction specifies the first hop direction (East or West), so memory instruction semantics have both an address and a dataflow direction (Figure 2).
[08:25:59] <shawwwn> > Streams are routed in the X-dimension through MEM, and routed in the Y-dimension using the SXM’s permuter and laneshifters to move data elements vertically. The MEM and SXM provide deterministic routing [16] of stream data as it flows in the X and Y dimensions, respectively.
[08:26:14] <nshepperd2> this is completely incomprehensible
[08:27:47] <shawwwn> as a bonus, when I asked them for actual code, they said that for now there was enough detail in this paper to understand how it works
[08:29:55] <shawwwn> I feel like this is sort of crucial: "To understand the novelty of our approach, consider the chip organization shown in Figure 1(a). In a conventional chip multiprocessor (CMP) [56] [12] each “tile” is an independent core which is interconnected using the on-chip network to exchange data between cores. Instruction execution is carried out over several stages [46]: 1) instruction fetch (IF), 2) instruction decode (ID), 3) 
[08:29:55] <shawwwn> execution on ALUs (EX), 4) memory access (MEM), and 5) writeback (WB) to update the results in the GPRs. In contrast from conventional multicore, where each tile is a heterogeneous collection of functional units but globally homogeneous, the TSP inverts that and we have local functional homogeneity but chip-wide (global) heterogeneity"
[08:31:03] <shawwwn> apparently GPRs stands for general purpose registers
[08:31:07] <shawwwn> I like that they used it and then defined it later on
[08:31:30] <shawwwn> what the hell is this saying?
[08:31:34] <shawwwn> > In contrast from conventional multicore, where each tile is a heterogeneous collection of functional units but globally homogeneous, the TSP inverts that and we have local functional homogeneity but chip-wide (global) heterogeneity.
[08:31:54] <shawwwn> local functional homogeneity
[08:32:16] <shawwwn> I think it's just saying "we expose the low level details to the programmer, whereas most chips tend to hide these"
[08:32:17] <rmmh> what are you trying to understand here
[08:32:31] <rmmh> no
[08:33:06] <rmmh> what they're saying is that rather than having N identical cores operating in parallel, they have N different groups of M cores that do a specific kind of processing
[08:33:35] <shawwwn> ah
[08:34:27] <rmmh> this works because NNs are weird and you can deeply pipeline them
[08:34:49] <rmmh> table 1 shows what each different group of cores does
[08:35:32] <shawwwn> mainly I'm trying to figure out basic questions like "How much memory is available per chip?" and "How is data sent between chips?"
[08:35:54] <shawwwn> I think the answer to the first question is 220MiB
[08:36:09] <shawwwn> but that implies that you'll need to string together a lot of chips to fit any kind of large model
[08:36:24] <shawwwn> thus far, I haven't seen any mention of that part
[08:36:58] <saturn2> isn't there external memory?
[08:37:14] <rmmh> II. Architecture Overview: "220MB of globally shared SRAM that delivers 32B/lane of stream bandwidth and low-latency access to model parameters. For example, the MEM can read and MXM can install 400K weights into all four 320×320 arrays in less than 40 cycles including SRAM and on-chip network transit delay."
[08:38:27] <shawwwn> saturn2: I'm starting to think the answer is no, no external memory
[08:38:39] <rmmh> of course there's external memory
[08:39:02] <saturn2> i'm confused...
[08:41:32] <rmmh> shawwwn: a bit easier to read https://groq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Groq-Rocks-NNs-Linley-Group-MPR-2020Jan06.pdf
[08:41:33] <Robomot> PDF (5 pages; 640 KB) - ￼GROQ ROCKS NEURAL NETWORKS … (Linley Gwennap)
[08:41:46] <shawwwn> ah, thanks
[08:42:06] <rmmh> linley group does lots of these uarch analyses
[08:43:11] <rmmh> oops I lied
[08:43:21] <rmmh> "The TSP’s large on-chip SRAM avoids the need for external memory, so it lacks DRAM controllers and interfaces. The chip includes a x16 PCI Express Gen4 interface to connect to the host processor"
[08:43:38] <rmmh> I guess your model needs to fit inside the memory provided?
[08:44:25] <shawwwn> that's going to be a bit of a problem, seeing as their goal is to implement GPT-J
[08:44:40] <shawwwn> and I'm pretty sure GPT-J doesn't fit in 220MB

[08:50:00] <shawwwn> if they do, why not mention it in the paper anywhere?

[09:39:43] <foamy> yeah quanticle, basically
[09:39:56] <foamy> something that supports the iOS share button/function
[09:40:11] <foamy> evernote does "in theory", but its always been slow and now doesnt work at all
[09:40:41] <quanticle> Maybe OneNote?

[09:49:23] <Robomot> Obsidian (Obsidian: A knowledge base that works on local Markdown files.)
[09:49:33] <quanticle> Obsidian is made by the Dynalist folks
[09:49:45] <quanticle> Dynalist is the outlining tool that predates Obsidian
[09:49:46] <rsaarelm> It feels like this stuff is crippled by the way people are trying to make One Everything App for it and everyone runs into deadly bloat, shortcomings or whatnot.
[09:49:59] <foamy> ^
[09:50:01] <foamy> always
[09:50:07] <foamy> or like
[09:50:07] <rsaarelm> When it should be spread out over small tools that can be combined and a better OS idiom.
[09:50:29] <foamy> "hey lets make an electron app that is shitty on every platform to save the cost of making a native app that actually works"
[09:50:37] <foamy> thanks evernote
[09:50:56] <quanticle> Anyway, before you get too excited about Obsidian, I don't use Obsidian (and I don't have iOS anything) so I'm definitely qualified to speak about the intersection of iOS and Obsidian.
[09:51:11] <rsaarelm> I'm going with "your OS idiom is parseable text files you edit with Vim, mobile users can suck it"
[09:51:12] <quanticle> s/qualified/*not* qualified/
[09:51:16] <foamy> yeah im not ready to switch to something comprehensively 
[09:51:27] <foamy> but obsidian / roam / something like it would be it
[09:51:47] <quanticle> I would assume that it can write Markdown files to Dropbox
[09:52:03] <rsaarelm> I'm planning on doing a small web app that lets you capture URLs from mobile, but serious work is not gonna happen.
[09:52:38] <rsaarelm> Obsidian look okay because it's easy to switch out of it if your data is just text files.
[09:53:28] <quanticle> Arguably yes, but on the other hand, org-mode is also "just text" and yet somehow there are no comprehensive org parsers other than org mode itself
[09:53:57] <energizer> athens is open source roam
[09:54:07] <adiabatic> I used Obsidian briefly on macOS. I'm still wedded to VoodooPad.
[09:54:09] <quanticle> Like, this gets back to that rant I had about the Unix philosophy. "Just text" is actually just as meaningless a statement as "just bytes"
[09:54:20] <shawwwn> I set up obsidian just now. I don’t see any way to clip a webpage from safari into obsidian
[09:54:23] <adiabatic> If I weren't a VoodooPad ride-or-die, I'd probably use Obsidian.
[09:54:37] <foamy> yeah thats a fail then shawwwn :(
[09:54:37] <shawwwn> Whereas with notion you just tap share
[09:54:53] <quanticle> I'm on the PMWiki ride-or-die
[09:55:00] <quanticle> Well, sort of
[09:55:07] <quanticle> My to-do list is Notion
[09:55:17] <foamy> notion is just way too bloated and tries to force way too much structure for very big 2nd brain knowledge bases
[09:55:26] <foamy> i have something similar to a zettelkestan
[09:55:31] <quanticle> Yes, which is why I use for *just* my todos
[09:55:32] <foamy> just text files that are tagged
[09:55:33] <shawwwn> Actually clicking share with notion results in “something went wrong” ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[09:55:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Notion keeps your data and is proprietary, that adds up to evil
[09:55:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Just say no
[09:55:59] <foamy> that too, notion has very poor data portability
[09:56:01] <rsaarelm> quanticle: That's why I have the One Weird Data Structure approach to stuff instead of org-modes flabbier "just text but a bunch of hairy one-off parsers".

[09:57:55] <rsaarelm> Thanks.
[09:58:24] <enterprisey> I love, as a side note, the term "ride or die" for describing one's relationship with software
[09:58:40] <quanticle> foamy: Yeah, one of the open-source software ideas I have is to make a clone not of Notion, but just of the specific parts of Notion that I use. Namely, boards and calendars. The reason I use Notion for my to-do list is mainly because I like the metaphor of being able to move task cards between calendars and kanban boards.
[09:58:40] <rsaarelm> It's still something of a crazy person project since I don't have anyone else trying to use it and the note-taking system I'm building on top of it and productively yelling at me about stupid or incomprehensible bits.

[10:14:10] <rsaarelm> Can you embed data with ready-made conventions of machine parseability in DynaList?
[10:14:32] <quanticle> No, but for a notetaking app, why would you want to?
[10:14:51] <rsaarelm> Like bookmark links like "Article Title\n  uri: https://example.com/\n  tags: xyzzy plugh\n  freeform notes go here..."
[10:14:52] <Robomot> Example Domain
[10:15:19] <rsaarelm> If you're saving URLs and want metadata on tags, where you got the link from, when you saved it and so forth.
[10:15:34] <adiabatic> "saving URLs" is what Pinboard is for, IMO
[10:15:36] <rsaarelm> And if you're doing something like scientific research where you're managing an ginormous bibliography and need automated tools to manage it.
[10:16:01] <rsaarelm> Costs money and rationalist-hating Pinboard guy can go fuck himself.
[10:16:09] <adiabatic> mhm, point
[10:16:16] <quanticle> Oh, I see what you mean. No, DynaList (and its older more primitive counterpart, Workflowy) are simple outliners. They just have text (formatted text) in the case of Dynalist, plain text in the case of Workflowy
[10:17:00] <rsaarelm> Yeah, idea with mine is that it starts out like dynalist or workflowy, but it scales up.
[10:17:30] <rsaarelm> Also WikiWords navigation, but that's a convention at the level of the notetaking program, not in IDM.
[10:18:32] <rsaarelm> Idea is, with personal notes you don't usually write wikipedia-style big complete pages for all your wikiword concepts, so instead you can write a microwiki inside a single file.
[10:19:36] <rsaarelm> Like if you're taking notes of something like the OSI model that has a bunch of concepts and TLAs thrown at you and you write the wikiword and couple lines of definition for each.
[10:22:58] <quanticle> I actually really dislike WikiWord navigation
[10:23:14] <quanticle> Mainly because I like being able to write ClassNames without them turning into links
[10:23:29] <rsaarelm> That's a problem.
[10:23:43] <rsaarelm> Though I'm using the markdown convention where you write `ClassName`.
[10:24:03] <rsaarelm> Which you already are supposed to do anyway if you for example write rustdocs.
[10:24:26] <quanticle> Yeah, that's fair. 
[10:24:42] <rsaarelm> And for really off the cuff notes I just don't care about fake links.
[10:24:56] <rsaarelm> Because I can always `` later if it gets annoying.

[14:33:41] <kuudes> how large intake would that correspond to?
[14:34:01] <PapuaHardyNet> overdosing on vitamin D isn't fun
[14:37:16] <capisce> afaik taking 5000IU per day is recommended
[14:37:32] <kuudes> well yes, but to what ng/ml does that bring you to?

[14:37:36] *** Quits: milanandreew (uid500468@user/milanandreew) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[14:37:49] <kuudes> ie I am after IU -> ng/ml
[14:37:57] <capisce> and if your shadow is taller than you then the sunlight effect is also too low from what I've heard
[14:38:31] <capisce> "According to the Institute of Medicine, 4000 IU is the safe upper level of daily vitamin D intake. However, doses up to 10,000 IU have not been shown to cause toxicity in healthy individuals"
[14:38:45] <Gurkenglas> always gather sunlight standing against a wall, got it
[14:38:54] <capisce> "Maintenance of a 30 to 32 ng/mL serum level requires approximately 2,200 to 3,000 IU/d of vitamin D from all sources"
[14:39:19] <kuudes> I eat 100 ug/day
[14:39:43] <capisce> sounds reasonable
[14:40:41] <capisce> "Vitamin D3 therapy (50,000-100,000 IU/week) was safe and effective when given for 12 months to reverse statin intolerance in patients with vitamin D deficiency. Serum vitamin D rarely exceeded 100 ng/mL, never reached toxic levels, and there were no significant change in serum calcium or eGFR."
[14:43:54] <PapuaHardyNet> took 60k IU one sunday, and then 60k IU the next sunday, ended up sick
[14:44:43] <PapuaHardyNet> (yes, I shouldn't have done that. I'm simply stating an anecdote. your body will not like overdosing)
[14:44:45] <kuudes> I guess if I wanted to increase, I should get a blood screen
[14:44:56] <capisce> PapuaHardyNet: why did you do that?
[14:45:11] <capisce> and how do you know getting sick was related to taking vitamin D?
[14:49:36] <PapuaHardyNet> Because I felt sick immediately, and it was nausea and vomiting - the top symptoms of vitamin d overdose
[14:50:02] <PapuaHardyNet> as for why I did that - thought to start a regular habit to take vitamin D, since I avoid the sun as much as possible
[14:53:53] <capisce> so why didn't you take 5-10k daily?
[14:54:03] <capisce> would you have taken 240k once per month if you could?
[14:55:05] <capisce> "Symptoms of vitamin D toxicity appear several months after excessive doses of vitamin D are administered."
[14:55:29] <capisce> I thought vitamin D toxicity could only build up over a long time after blood levels are elevated due to frequent oversupplementation
[14:55:57] <capisce> "Acute overdose requires between 15,000 µg/d (600,000 IU per day) and 42,000 µg/d (1,680,000 IU per day) over a period of several days to months."
[14:58:42] <capisce> I guess taking it once a week shouldn't be causing such adverse effects either
[15:02:17] <PapuaHardyNet> didn't get <60k IU tabs

[18:59:56] <feep> you know what's a good day at work? when you get to use the term "causal shadow volume" in a sprint task description <3
[19:01:02] <nshepperd2> let's aim to have our future light cone secured in the next two weeks, then work from there
[19:01:21] <feep> I mean, sort of XD
[19:01:36] <feep> actually let me sketch the problem
[19:01:48] <feep> we have a bunch of events we want to persist to a database that is shit^W kinda slow at sequential processing
[19:02:15] <feep> we want to parallelize save tasks, but we don't want to parallelize save tasks where that could lead to two causally connected events happening in the wrong order
[19:02:34] <feep> so there's n keys, where each key expresses "if two sequential events have the same key, they are causally connected"
[19:03:35] <feep> and my algo is "store a list of events in flight, for each event: build a set of affected values for each key, if you find an event that overlaps on at least one key *or* is currently being executed, add all its keys to the sets; if you find an event where no keys are affected, execute it"
[19:03:40] <gwern> so you build a DAG and traverse breadth-first to ensure efficient serialization?
[19:03:57] <feep> no because what "breadth" may change as nodes get removed.
[19:03:59] <feep> means*
[19:04:19] <feep> sort of "breadth-first multihead"
[19:04:34] <gwern> I'd expect a 'remove' node to be added to the bottom to be serialized out in proper order. you don't want to erase history
[19:04:39] <feep> nono, I mean
[19:04:46] <feep> multiple dag nodes can be persisted at once
[19:04:51] <feep> that's the whole point
[19:05:07] <feep> but yes, effectively at each step I'm looking for a free dag root
[19:05:54] <feep> it's just not something that can be precomputed because different areas of the dag can end up processed at a different rate.

[21:53:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes... which the author of the article says, quite clearly :p
[21:53:59] <rmmh> In 1908 Herbert Johnson, an engineer for the Hobart Manufacturing Company, invents an electric standing mixer. His inspiration came from observing a baker mixing bread dough with a metal spoon; soon he was toying with a mechanical counterpart. By 1915, his 80-quart mixer was standard equipment for most large bakeries. In 1919 Hobart introduced the KitchenAid Food Preparer (stand mixer) for the
[21:54:01] <rmmh> home
[21:54:11] <rmmh> imagine cornering a market on a new appliance in 7 years
[21:57:06] <ggreer> this article contains no new information. stand mixers were popular a century ago. then handheld mixers were invented and took over most of that market. now stand mixers are making a comeback because people have more space/money for appliances and like to cook more ornate recipies
[21:57:35] <rmmh> did hand mixers really cannibalize it?
[21:58:41] <gwern> 'KitchenAid may have been first, but the widespread acceptance of the electric standing mixer actually belongs to a more populist-priced appliance, the Sunbeam MixMaster invented by Ivar Jepson's. Sold at a fraction of the KitchenAid's price (in the early 1930s, it retailed for $18.25, about $240 in 2002 dollars), the MixMaster caught on like wildfire. Within six years of its 1930...
[21:58:47] <gwern> ...introduction -and at the height of the Depression -the company was selling 300,000 MixMasters a year. Sunbeam put out its first hand-held MixMaster in 1952. Although the KitchenAid standing mixer is the current market leader, the Sunbeam MixMaster remains a viable rival.' hm
[21:59:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> ggreer: ... the point is that she's comparing recipes used BEFORE stand mixers with recipes used SINCE stand mixers
[21:59:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> i.e., people ask "how did people make these recipes before stand mixers" and the answer is "they did not make these recipes at all"
[21:59:57] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : "What they're saying: "Almost always when there is drug or firearm-related activity, there is also unkept property," Jennifer Berger, head of the social justice division in Attorney General Karl Racine's office, told Axios. "It usually goes hand-in-hand with overgrown shrubs, trash that is not being picked up, doors that are not being secured [and] inadequate lighting.""
[22:00:14] <two2thehead> It's almost as though 'Broken Windows policing' was right :thinking_face\:
[22:00:25] <ggreer> lots of reasons the recipes are different. for example: lack of ingredients
[22:01:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Lack of ingredients like ... butter? :p
[22:01:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> A standard yellow cake ain't exactly a complex assembly of exotic foodstuffs
[22:03:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sugar, butter, flour, eggs, milk / buttermilk, salt, some combination of baking soda / baking powder / vinegar, flavorings
[22:04:23] <gwern> two2thehead: but correlation is not causation, so I hope she's not saying that trimming overgrown shrugs will increase social justice by reducing crime...
[22:04:43] <gwern> (even increasing lighting, which might plausibly directly decrease crime, can just displace it, iirc)
[22:05:29] <two2thehead> gwern, Honestly if I was a parent, and my child had to duck bullets every time she goes outside, I'd be happy with just displacement of crime :-/
[22:05:45] <gwern> but then what happens when the parents in the displaced area lobby for it to be displaced?

[22:08:29] <two2thehead> ggreer, you are assuming hypocrisy is unique to one party :p
[22:08:39] <rmmh> are drug deals just performed in whatever place has the least surveillance
[22:09:22] <ggreer> my guess is that locations become popular based on a combination of demand and lack of enforcement
[22:09:39] <two2thehead> rmmh, iirc there is a negative correlation between general infrastructure level and quality and crime/drug activity. I'm not an expert though so double check my work
[22:10:06] <rmmh> negative?

[22:36:45] <gwern> 'After aiding their adversaries when their lives are in peril, the Stampers are handed two calamities at once, a falling tree that severs Henry's arm, and a trunk that crushes Joe Ben in shallow water. Lee takes his father to the hospital, while Joe Ben laughs at his own predicament until the tree trunk rolls atop him, pinning him down. Hank's desperate rescue attempts fail as the tide rises,...
[22:36:51] <gwern> ...drowning Joe Ben. At the hospital, Henry dies after finally expressing his approval of Lee, who informs Hank that Viv has left him. Hank returns to an empty home and appears for a while to have given up. Ultimately, he decides to deliver the logs, alone if necessary, but Lee joins him. Lining up along the riverbank, the Stampers' rivals look forward to seeing them fail, but the brothers...

[22:41:58] <gwern> I did, but that was mostly just shooting
[22:41:59] <ggreer> yeah watching henry fonda murder a kid was great
[22:42:05] <ggreer> and then he tortured that paralyzed man
[22:42:07] <ggreer> good times
[22:42:35] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: and also, Once Upon A Time In The West had such shock value *because* it was fonda
[22:42:51] <gwern> so you can't really use it as an excuse. this is shocking for the same reason Once was
[22:44:02] <gwern> I mean, you don't expect henry fonda to shoot a kid... and you also don't expect him to have his arm ripped off by a tree, die in a hospital after being told his wife has left him, and his ripped off arm used to give his enemies the finger
[22:44:36] <ggreer> yeah Once Upon a Time in the West was before this movie. fonda had already played a bad guy. as the old saying goes: fool me once, shame on- shame on you. fool me... you can't get fooled again!

[23:39:13] <shawwwn> the chip to chip instructions "Manage skew across plesiochronous links"
[23:40:22] <gwern> ah, that makes sense. the clocks on each chip aren't going to be identical
[23:40:28] <shawwwn> why wouldn't they be?
[23:40:51] <gwern> because they are physically located in different places, at different temperatures, will have different crystals and defects...
[23:41:12] <shawwwn> oh
[23:41:15] <shawwwn> well
[23:41:20] <gwern> these might all seem trivial but if you are doing stuff at sub-nanosecond resolution which depends on timestamps always being correct, quadrillions of times in a row...
[23:41:20] <shawwwn> it seems that each TSP has 220MB of memory
[23:41:35] <shawwwn> and each chip to chip Send operation can transfer 320 byte vectors at a time
[23:41:55] <shawwwn> so that raises the question of how many C2C send operations can run per cycle
[23:42:23] <shawwwn> https://i.imgur.com/FznkNgb.png
[23:42:55] <shawwwn> > Chip-to-chip (C2C) modules provide Send and Receive primitives for exchanging 320-byte vectors between a pair of chips. The first TSP implementation (Figure 5) has a total of sixteen (16) ×4 links operating at 30 Gbps each for a total off-chip bandwidth of 16 ×4 ×30Gb/s ×2 directions = 3.84 Tb/s of off-chip pin bandwidth that can be flexibly partitioned to support highradix [37] [49] [3] interconnection networks of TSPs for 
[23:42:55] <shawwwn> large-scale systems. The host interface for PCIe Gen4 is also handled in this module. It provides a lightweight DMA engine to emplace a model onto the TSP memory, and provides an entry point for bootstrapping the model execution. It also provides a general mechanism for passing interrupts to the host, which may be necessary in the event we observe a multi-bit memory error, for example
