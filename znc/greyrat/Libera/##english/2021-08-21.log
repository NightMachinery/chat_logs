[11:23:06] <StayHungry> pussipupu: seems to be a part of culture, at least in the US
[11:24:20] <pussipupu> Yes but it's not a big thing in the Anglosphere in general
[11:24:33] <pussipupu> It's not a feature of the language or the orthography
[11:25:33] <pussipupu> It's just a claim I've heard expressed uncritically a few times recently and doesn't stand up
[11:26:01] <StayHungry> pussipupu: in English a relatively small number of phonemes are conveyed by a huge number of possible graphemes, many spellings have developed historically and do not correspond to pronunciation, therefore it is often difficult to reproduce the written form of a perceived word without knowing it in advance
[11:27:13] <pussipupu> Um, no on the phoneme/grapheme point and that English spelling is fairly irregular is not related to my point
[11:27:56] <ksft> doesn't English have a pretty average number of phonemes?
[11:29:05] <ksft> Wikipedia says it has "a rather large set" of vowels and "close to average" for consonants: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme#Numbers_of_phonemes_in_different_languages
[11:29:50] <pussipupu> Yeah, and an orthography about the right amount of mad given the time since  the last large standardisation
[11:30:00] <ksft> isn't irregular orthography necessary for spelling bees to make sense?
[11:30:16] <ksft> of course, that's not a feature of the *language*
[11:30:22] <pussipupu> Probably, they don't make sense to me as an outlander anyway
[11:30:46] <pussipupu> It's necessary but not sufficient, as evidenced by spelling bees not being a big deal all over the Anglosphere

[23:07:13] <StayHungry> roo-: provide an example :)
[23:07:21] <roo-> Let me try :)

[23:21:01] <roo-> Let's say that I'm describing all the events that happened to me yesterday. Yesterday I've decided to work on my car. I thought it would make sense to begin by cleaning and removing all the junk in the trunk. I began by removing all the dirty carpets and I hang them on the fence. Then I take the rest of the of unusable accessories and put them on the pavement.
[23:22:24] <roo-> Is there any scenario where I can use: "Then I take the rest" ... and not: "Then I took the rest"?

[23:26:28] <TechTest> not really, you are talking about the past, yesterday
[23:27:25] <TechTest> and probably "unused" instead of "unusable"
[23:27:50] <roo-> (what's wrong with unusable?)
[23:29:17] <roo-> (items that can't/shouldn't be used, expired, bad, etc?)
[23:30:41] *** Parts: Autoclesis (~Autoclesi@user/autoclesis) (Leaving)
[23:33:18] <LuisP14> yea, that differs from unused
[23:34:41] <TechTest> roo-: do you mean trash basically? if so, sure
[23:34:50] <roo-> Yea
[23:34:55] <TechTest> I just thought you meant accessories you don't use
[23:35:19] <TechTest> so are you sure "accessories" is what you want ro use?
[23:36:16] <roo-> I actually just threw a bunch of words together for illustrating the usage of "Then I take"
[23:36:34] <StayHungry> roo-: this is the first chapter of Bram Stoker's 'Dracula', check how events are described https://www.townsendpress.com/sites/default/files/tinymce/Library Excerpts/dracula_ch1.pdf
[23:36:45] <TechTest> I don't think you'd referr to items that are not in a usable condition as "accessories"
[23:36:55] <TechTest> roo-: ah ok

[23:37:54] <roo-> StayHungry: Thanks, I'm on it
[23:39:04] <TechTest> trash, usable staff or broken accessories maybe
[23:41:10] *** Quits: r3 (~r3@ntp/admin/r3) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[23:43:44] <roo-> StayHungry: There!
[23:44:02] <roo-> Wait, one moment
[23:44:54] <roo-> "The hotel was very old-fashioned, and this delighted me, for, ofcourse, I want to see all the old traditions of this country"
[23:45:07] <roo-> Shouldn't it be: "I wanted to see"?
[23:45:29] <roo-> of course*
[23:47:02] <StayHungry> he describes experiences (past) and current thoughts (present)
[23:47:34] <roo-> Okay, bad example, let me keep going
[23:51:54] *** Quits: bullgard4 (~bullgard4@dslb-094-223-004-207.094.223.pools.vodafone-ip.de) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:52:48] <StayHungry> roo-: just a bit below another example of playing with time: 'I _thought_ that knowing something about the region _would help_ me make a good impression on Count Dracula, the nobleman with whom I _will be_ dealing' (past, sequence of tenses, future)
[23:55:22] <roo-> In this chapter I couldn't find anything with a similarity to what I would like to have
[23:56:06] <roo-> The only way I can think to describe it: I would like to tell a story that happened in the past, but as-if it's currently evolving
[23:56:39] <StayHungry> roo-: what's your native language?
[23:56:48] <roo-> Hebrew
