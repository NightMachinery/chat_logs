[00:10:43] <Vova> Hello. I have recently written some funky code for MSBuild with regular expressions. I wonder if anybody did it, too.
[00:13:22] <Vova> I wanted to align an integer and a floating-point number type across a few projects, and ended up with generating a bunch of configurations and assigning the currently selected one to the defined constants property, and then checked for those with the preprocessor conditionals.
[00:13:49] <Vova> What do you think of this approach?
[00:19:54] <aFuzzyBear> VectorX thank you, I will do,

[01:39:35] <aFuzzyBear> just the last object, the function will only accept three params, and its the last one i need,

[07:47:30] <midnite> Hi, I'm trying to figure out how to select groups of two or more whitespaces characters, but only when they're not at the beginning of the line, i.e. they come after some non-whitespace character(s)
[07:47:48] <midnite> and after saying that
[07:47:55] <midnite> I think I may have realized how to solve my problem
[07:49:57] <midnite> this appears to work: 
[07:49:59] <midnite> (?<=\S)[\s]+
[07:50:07] <midnite> is there a better way, or is that alright?
[07:51:30] <JohnDoe2> yeah that works as an implicit condition but it will match all-throughout the string where there a nonspace followed by 1 or more whitespace characters. The [ ] is superfluous. You can just use \s+
[07:51:59] <midnite> I realized a proble here...
[07:52:21] <Me-me> (?!^)\s{2,}
[07:52:22] <midnite> problem* ...it matches whitespace-linebreak-whitespace all as one
[07:52:30] <Me-me> Sure, newlines are whitespace.
[07:52:32] <midnite> when I'd like it to match that as two separate groups
[07:52:52] <midnite> how do I specify just the space character?
[07:52:54] <JohnDoe2> you might be better off splitting by [\r\n]+ at the end
[07:52:57] <JohnDoe2> " "
[07:54:39] <Me-me> When JohnDoe2 says " " he means, you can just type a space.
[07:54:56] <midnite> (?<=\S)[ ]+ is almost what I want
[07:55:22] <midnite> wait, no, I think that's it
[07:55:22] <JohnDoe2> you can also ignore me when I said you can use \s+ if you want 2 or more then use Me-me's {2,}
[07:55:41] <midnite> right, (?<=\S) +
[07:55:57] <Me-me> (?!^) {2,}
[07:57:38] <midnite> I'm trying to remove excess spaces from an HTML file that used to be a Word document in which I used spaces to space some things out on the page
[07:57:48] <midnite> without messing up the indentation
[07:57:55] <midnite> in case you were wondering
[07:59:42] <midnite> how would I use this with sed? I tried this
[07:59:43] <midnite> sed 's/(?<=\S) +/ ' <index.html >despaced_index.html
[08:00:02] <midnite> and got exit code of 1: "s/(?<=\S) +/ ": unterminated substitute in regular expression
[08:02:22] <midnite> I'm no

[08:17:37] <Me-me> I don't know why you're saying it wouldn't work. Why wouldn't it work?

[12:39:55] <digitok> your question is a bit more than just regex, and tbh i am not entirely sure what method is typically used to achieve that
[12:40:38] <digitok> in regex, you could do it like /^T?O?R?T?P?V?e?r?[\w:.]*$/
[12:40:47] <digitok> but i doubt that is how other people do it
[12:40:56] <digitok> and actually that is wrong
[12:41:22] <re101-goose-97> ok let me try
[12:42:03] <digitok> it would be /^(T(O(R(T(P(V(e(r(:[\w:.]*)?)?)?)?)?)?)?)?)?$/

[13:56:36] <Me-me> You did not actually give a pattern.

[15:07:22] <mathijs> Hi there. Could anybody be of assistance? I'm having trouble getting a regular expression to work inside a Javascript string. I'm obligated to use Javascript for HTML instead of just HTML. The regular expression in normal HTML is working perfectly, but as soon as i try to include it in Javascript, the escaping makes it real complicated. The URL is
[15:07:22] <mathijs> https://regex101.com/r/6RiXNq/1
[15:08:53] <mathijs> The working regular expression is: oninput="this.value = this.value.replace(/[^0-9\/.]/g, \'\').replace(/(\..*)\./g, \'$1\');". Inside JS string, the escaping is not working correctly. Output should be: user types two characters into input (type text) and an automatic "/" is being added. Format is dd/mm/yyyy.
[15:09:38] *** Joins: src (~src@user/src)
[15:09:41] <mathijs> so dd -> automatic '/' -> mm -> automatic '/' -> yyyy (limited to max characters)
[15:20:56] <digitok> i do not see how the current solution would be working

[15:25:57] <mathijs> How do you mean? Inside the JS string? Or the normal regular expression?
[15:27:19] <digitok> just the two .replace()'s
[15:27:32] <digitok> one removes chars that are not numbers, /, or .
[15:27:49] <digitok> and one seems to remove the last . in the string but only if there is at least one before it

[21:18:11] <qswz> how to make a simple regex for catching a word with no space and containing _, e.g: 'user_disabled'
[21:21:55] <qswz> well, my need is probably /^[a-z]+([_.][a-z]+)+$/
[21:28:21] <koollman> qswz: /^[a-z]+[a-z_]+$/
[21:28:59] <qswz> no bad
[21:29:07] <qswz> but it could end with _
[21:29:12] <qswz> well, good enough
[21:29:21] <qswz> and it's simpler, so I like yours better
[21:29:42] <koollman> qswz: /^[a-z]+[a-z_]+[a-z]+$/ , if you want it not ending with _ ... but is it realistic anyway ? :)

[21:43:39] <re101-human-63> Hi Everyone. I've been beating my head against the wall on this for a while. I'm trying to capture the 'P2' characters after the 'Priority\r\n\r\n' string in the text. The number after the P can be any number from 1 to 5. This is the regex so far: https://regex101.com/r/WqcjtU/1
[21:45:05] <qswz> it shoudln't be \n in the text area, but an actual line return
[21:45:12] <qswz> I think
[21:45:32] <qswz> oh, nvm you're using \\n in the regex, fine
[21:45:40] <re101-human-63> I want to select those two characters after the string. The string is a text string, so it isn't an actual \n.
[21:46:53] <qswz> Priority\\r\\n\\r\\nP([1-5])
[21:47:30] *** Joins: nvmd (~nvmd@user/nvmd)
[21:49:04] <re101-human-63> How do I only select the P([1-5]) section?   I want to search the string for the "Priority\\r\\n\\r\\n" and only select the next two characters. Not the whole thing.

[22:08:18] <re101-human-63> [Priority\\r\\n\\r\\n]P[1-5]  gets me closer, but for some reason it is also selecting 'n' and I don't understand why. The result of that is 'nP2' from the text string.
