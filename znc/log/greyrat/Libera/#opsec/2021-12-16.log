[03:51:20] <Joanna> Monogamy or polygamy should be up to the people getting married in a country which has “freedom of religion “ the government shouldn’t be dictating age or race of who you marry either.
[03:52:49] <Joanna> People used to consider the church to be their government though so if you didn’t like the rules you could leave the church
[03:59:09] <Joanna> Polygamy is good when there is a shortage of men like after a war for instance.
