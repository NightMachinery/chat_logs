[08:20:41] <telegram_1088989> > what tool is there to recover its deleted data now?
[08:20:41] <telegram_1088989> Recuva is the best i have used. .but obv its not available for linux.
[08:21:57] <vipul[m]> telegram_1088989: it wont detect linux fs mangesh knows
[08:22:24] <vipul[m]> ddrescue or photorec are great tools on linux side
[08:25:48] <telegram_1088989> vipul[m]: it supports ext4 ...
[08:27:33] <vipul[m]> telegram_1088989: any proof? and they dont have a native linux binary as well. its just underwheling to the choices linux comes with
[08:29:57] <vipul[m]> and its by ccleaner people. that alone is sufficient to ditch recuva. in words of bugz....
[08:32:16] <pystardust> irc-open-up: http://0x0.st/-7GW.txt , i use it like this
[08:32:20] <vipul[m]> thats for ccleaner. and not recuva
[08:32:22] <telegram_1088989> vipul[m]: well yeah but i am just suggesting
[08:32:22] <telegram_1088989> its his choice
[08:32:22] <telegram_1088989> one time i needed to restore some stuffs
[08:32:22] <telegram_1088989> i tried 5-6 softwares. .recuva was the only one that recovered more than 75%
[08:32:24] <telegram_1088989> vipul[m]: bruh. read again. .obv its for recuva
[08:32:24] <_devnull[m]> <vipul[m]> "ddrescue or photorec are great..." <- the image recovered from my corrupted drive was showing the same bad fs superblock error by mounting it. so i decided to call. it a day and forget about recovering starting with fresh

[08:32:32] <vipul[m]> telegram_1088989: now the most important question. is recuva available for linux?
[08:32:50] <telegram_1088989> vipul[m]: well i cleared this in the first msg only
[08:33:16] <vipul[m]> telegram_1088989: ahh yeah. then no point in going further.
[08:33:35] <_devnull[m]> _devnull[m]: may be advance options like replacing headers block and stuff i might get it working.
[08:33:35] <_devnull[m]> but again thats upto forensic stuff
[08:33:36] <vipul[m]> its inferior in with that point alone😜
[08:35:18] <vipul[m]> > <>_ /dev/null> may be advance options like replacing headers block and stuff i might get it working.
[08:35:18] <vipul[m]> > but again thats upto forensic stuff
[08:35:18] <vipul[m]> so its a physical problem?
[08:35:35] <mangeshrex[m]> Is this girl really a girl ?
[08:36:01] <mangeshrex[m]> Why do boys change their names to girls?
[08:36:14] <vipul[m]> mangeshrex[m]: pranjal can be a boys name as well
[08:36:16] <mangeshrex[m]> They could have told on the namkaran ceremony itself
[08:36:28] <mangeshrex[m]> Ahh
[08:37:17] <vipul[m]> https://www.youtube.com/c/pranjalkamra
[08:37:26] <vipul[m]> ^^^ real world proof
[08:37:51] <mangeshrex[m]> F nice
[08:56:30] <_devnull[m]> <mangeshrex[m]> "Is this girl really a girl ?" <- pranjal is unisex name. 
[08:56:30] <_devnull[m]> pranjali is female variant.
[08:57:31] <_devnull[m]> <mangeshrex[m]> "Why do boys change their names..." <- why you are obsessed with names of girls and boys btw. 
[08:57:31] <_devnull[m]> are you going to be dad 😂
[09:00:53] <mangeshrex[m]> 😮
[09:01:11] <mangeshrex[m]> I'm not even 18 yet
