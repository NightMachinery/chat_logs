[12:58:38] <matt_mills[m]> dunno who owns the gnuradio.org wiki, seems like the math renderer is not working right: https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/IQ_Complex_Tutorial
[12:59:07] <matt_mills[m]> per a quick googling of the error: "If you do not install mathoid (and RESTBase), you may use wikipedia's RESTBase, which is what it's using now by default. However, you must ensure PHP is able to connect to wikipedia, which is probably blocked by one of your firewalls or SELinux and that's the error message you're getting"
[13:07:47] <monowar> I'm getting the same error both on my pc and phone.

[15:26:20] <linge93[m]> Does anyone know how to improve the accuracy of USRP transmission and reception (for example, shorten the distance between two USRPs, increase transmission power, etc.)? I changed the original antenna connection to a wired connection, and found that the interference seems to be greater. What is going on?
[15:28:53] <tnt> did you put an attenuator in between the two ?
[15:29:18] <rodrirq[m]> Does anyone know how to install gr-dslwp if I have installed GNU Radio 3.8 via PyBombs?
[15:29:54] <linge93[m]> tnt: No, I don’t have an attenuator
[15:31:48] <linge93[m]> Will this cause a bigger problem? I think the USRP may be damaged due to excessive power, but the error should not be greater than that of the antenna transceiver. I am confused.
[15:32:37] <tnt> huh ... of course it can be greater ...
[15:32:57] <tnt> you're overloading _massively_ the input, it will behave in all sort of non-linear ways.
[15:37:05] <linge93[m]> How should this situation be resolved? By the way, can two USRPs completely guarantee clock synchronization?
[15:37:48] <linge93[m]> Because I want to minimize the interference of the data received by the USRP
[15:38:57] <Yamakaja[m]> linge93: Fyi, you can destroy the input stage of your USRP by connecting TX to RX without an attenuator!
[15:43:44] <linge93[m]> That’s too bad, I’ll use an antenna or look for an attenuator
[15:48:54] <linge93[m]> Is there any way to make the signal received by usrp as accurate as possible?
[15:55:33] <tnt> Their clock won't be synchronized, you need to use a shared external clock source if you want that.

[16:19:15] <matt_mills[m]> I just saw it on Reddit and figured it'd be more likely for someone to be able to fix it over here so :P
[16:20:13] <BarryDuggan[m]> FYI, gnuradio.org 'owns' the wiki.
[16:20:43] <matt_mills[m]> yeah I figured that much, just wasn't sure if someone specific managed the infrastructure
[16:20:59] <matt_mills[m]> like with apache the apache people do all that for you
[16:21:43] <BarryDuggan[m]> it's all GNU Radio volunteers.

[18:49:00] <utente> hello, i am a newbie. with gnuradio it is possible to sniff smartpones presence? i mean, i dont want to listen the comunication of other people (them are encrypted) but i want to monitor if and how many mobilephones are araond me. In other words, i want to do to with mobilephone frequencies what airodump does with wifi frequencies.

[19:41:01] <utente> Zero_Chaos, what hardware have I to use? i mean, wifi frequencies are around 2,4Ghz, but mobilephone are on different frequencies.
[19:42:14] <utente> Zero_Chaos, i neel only to know if a mobilephone is near to me and if possible, how much near, no more
[19:45:41] <funkylab[m]> "how near" is much harder than knowing a lot of other things
[19:45:54] <funkylab[m]> essentially, it's a bit impossible, due to the nature of multipath propagation
[19:46:17] <funkylab[m]> but presence is definitely possible
[19:46:44] <Yamakaja[m]> Even in free space determining distance probably requires a bunch of assumptions you might not want to make :D
[19:47:06] <Hash[m]> Yamakaja: I'm narrowing down on the Rigol RSA3015n since it has 10MHz RTBW upgradable to 40MHz, unless Aaronia gets back to me with a smoking Christmas special! :)
[19:49:31] <utente> funkylab[m], let me try to be more clear. let say i am in the place.. POINT_A. i want to set up a device (ie: raspberry) that "sniff the air" and report me if some smarthone enter into he range of detection, so i can log when a device enter into the range of detection and whe i get out of it. just that. ifi it is possible? if yes, what hardware i need and what software i need to set up all the stuff?
[19:49:39] <Yamakaja[m]> Hash: Sounds good! Still, please keep us up to date about any special offers from aaronia ;D
[19:50:12] <utente> and when it get out*
[19:51:06] <funkylab[m]> utente: HW: some sort of software defined radio device that supports the required frequency and bandwidth
[19:51:06] <funkylab[m]> SW: see what zero_chaos said, also look into SDR implementations of 4G/5G. Note that you *won't* be able to identify the device, such info is not available unencryptedly (and that's a good thing)
[19:52:00] <funkylab[m]> so, next time the same device enters your observation, you won't know it's the same.
[19:52:11] <funkylab[m]> (under proper circumstances)
[19:53:43] <utente> funkylab[m], if the same device will be different the second time it came into range, then it means my idea is not feasable because my wish was to recognize the movment of the device. So, i cannot do what i want.
[19:54:26] <utente> at least i save a lot ot time to try because it is not possible.
[19:54:27] <funkylab[m]> that's a win for privacy!
[19:55:10] <funkylab[m]> basically, the mobile identifies itself towards the network in an encrypted manner, and then gets a temporary ID and key, so that's by design
[19:55:37] <utente> funkylab[m], for sure it is. shame that "bad guys" are able to "f*ck" myt phone everytime they want using zero day in android/IOS :-)
[19:56:27] <funkylab[m]> your phone getting hacked with an android 0day should approach probability zero. These things are way too expensive to waste on you...
[19:56:54] <funkylab[m]> especially if you consider that if anyone wants to get movement and online profiles, they will just have to buy it from ad networks
[19:57:43] <utente> funkylab[m], of course i am not interesting to NSA and other bad guys. simply, i sai that the can do if they want. so ,despite gsm protocol "should be" secure, then can use other fay to enter.
[19:58:04] <funkylab[m]> Oh, I wasn't refering to GSM
[19:58:09] <funkylab[m]> that's a different story
[19:58:41] <funkylab[m]> you said "smartphone presence", and I infered you're way past 2G
[19:59:04] <utente> funkylab[m], well, then i am not understndign what you want to say. can you make it more easy for me? i am not a technitian in this field :-/
[19:59:32] <funkylab[m]> and GSM "should be secure" might be a bit of an overstatement; in GSM, a lot of the privacy and security measures were optional / configurable to be bad, but that's not the same for 4G (at least as far as I know)
[19:59:41] <utente> funkylab[m], no, i am referring to *actual* smartpone. i.e. i ave a LG with android 6.
[19:59:50] <funkylab[m]> I am too.
[20:01:30] <utente> so, let me tell this: is mi mobile following the same security you said before? (temporary ID that change every X time)
[20:02:34] <funkylab[m]> yes. 4G doesn't broadcast your subscriber identity.
[20:02:40] <utente> it that case, my idea to "sniff presence and log we i came and when i go" is not possible
[20:02:48] <utente> PROJECT DELETED :-)
[20:03:52] <funkylab[m]> there might be ways to identify smartphones, though, based on usage patterns, based on the wifis they are probing for, based on guessing their make and model and firmware versions from behavioural info
[20:04:20] <funkylab[m]> but completely different topic, and honestly, I think you will need to look into this more on your own time.
[20:05:11] <utente> ok thanks :-)
