[05:40:06] <johnjaye> i think @ and $ refer to parameters
[05:40:13] <greycat> use backtick, not tilde
[05:40:24] <pj> cd ~
[05:40:31] <greycat> backticks are deprecated, so you *shouldn't* be using them
[05:40:39] <greycat> you use tilde all the time
[05:40:45] <johnjaye> so you have to use $( ) instead of `` ?
[05:40:53] <greycat> you SHOULD BE using $()
[05:40:57] <johnjaye> ok
[05:41:02] <greycat> !`
[05:41:02] <greybot> The backquote (`) is used in the old-style command substitution, e.g. foo=`command`. The foo=$(command) syntax is recommended instead. Backslash handling inside $() is less surprising, and $() is easier to nest. See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/082
[05:41:06] <johnjaye> today I learned
[05:41:45] <pj> I'm not sure if deprecated is the right word for it since they will always have to be around to avoid breaking craptons of old scripts, but yeah, don't use backticks.
[05:42:38] <greycat> OK, the man page calls is "old-style" and does not actually say deprecated.  Yet.
[05:42:51] <johnjaye> isn't that exactly what deprecated means? still sort of legal but don't do it cause it's a bad idea?
[05:43:15] <greycat> deprecated means "don't use this, because it may go away soon"

[12:22:48] <selckin> freebsd manual says %s is extention to iso c99, but if it works on bsd,mac,linux then what else do you want :)
[12:22:51] <wyre> so that's what I was wondering first on how to do this with /bin/sh
[12:23:19] <pj> Soliton: under "CONFORMING TO", "There are strict inclusions between the set of conversions given in ANSI C (unmarked)".  %s is unmarked, therefore conforming to ANSI C.

[12:23:53] <codebam> you just put a double $$
[12:24:53] <Soliton> also the printf eval craziness is anyone's guess what that should accomplish.
[12:24:55] <pj> what the hell is GHR?
[12:25:19] <codebam> it's a github release client. I put it in my makefile and run `make upload` from CI

[13:46:32] <jaggz> how do I get my function usable from my bash script?
[13:46:43] <selckin> !source
[13:46:43] <greybot> ''. scriptname'' (or ''source scriptname'', which is not portable) reads and executes the commands from scriptname in the current shell, as opposed to a separate instance of the shell. If scriptname does not contain a slash (/), it will be searched for in $PATH.
[13:46:44] <jaggz> it's in my env currently.. is there an "export" or shopt type deal for them?
[13:46:54] <geirha> source ./file-with-functions.bash
[13:47:07] <Soliton> if it's in your env then surely you already did the export...
[13:47:18] <jaggz> so they're not passed to scripts (subshells?) no matter what?
[13:47:41] <grawity> *technically* yes, there is an "export" type deal for functions, but I'm going to say it's really a bad idea to have scripts expect to import functions from environment...
[13:47:46] <Soliton> do you really want your script to depend on what functions might currently be exported?
[13:47:47] <grawity> just put them in a file and source it
[13:47:49] <jaggz> Soliton, as a function, does export do anything?
[13:47:52] <grawity> like a library

[17:18:27] <Payam90> guys one question
[17:19:20] <Payam90> I have automized the release process of my application. When I set a tag it should print all the commits from the latest tag to the newly created tag.

[17:19:57] *** Joins: Filohuhum (~dante@gateway/tor-sasl/filohuhum)
[17:20:22] <Payam90> so I need to get a list of commits betwwn newly created tag and the tag before it.
[17:21:42] <Soliton> so you want to check the documentation of your version control system how to list tags.
[17:22:07] <Payam90> https://bpa.st/K26Q
[17:22:12] <geirha> or maybe parse the previous tag from the changelog file
[17:22:35] <Payam90> this is what I have now but it only looks at the newly created tag and after it.

[18:47:54] <Earnest> dfdx: ${file%?} removes last and ${file#?} removes first.  This is POSIX, bash has :: slice notation which could also work
[18:48:15] <Earnest> Here the glob ? is used to just match one character
[18:48:43] <Earnest> # file=foo.mp3; print "${file%?}"4
[18:48:45] <shbot> Earnest: foo.mp4

[18:50:53] <dfdx> ahhh.... that makes so much sense. thanks.
[18:51:07] <dfdx> the first example makes sense, I need to brush up on the :: slice notation, though, looks super useful.

[19:09:07] <Soliton> did you wish really hard that bash would use regex there though?
[19:09:20] <Soliton> it only works if you truely believe.
[19:09:26] <dfdx> I must not be a true believer.
[19:09:56] <Soliton> !=~
[19:09:56] <greybot> The =~ operator of [[ evaluates the left hand string against the right hand ERE (see <ere>, <regex>). After a successful match, the BASH_REMATCH array contains the matched string and subexpressions (if any). Any quoted characters in the ERE become literal. Best to put the whole ERE in a variable: [[ $string =~ $regex ]]
[19:10:05] <Earnest> dfdx: // expects a glob, not regex.  bash does have extended globs, I don't remember if it can repeat like this

[22:50:19] <colo> on Linux, is there a file that will block when read, and yield no output? or, put another way: can I somehow emulate sleep(1) by using read -t sometimeout, without resorting to a dummy fifo or the like?

[23:11:05] <OnlineCop> !declare
[23:11:05] <greybot> The "declare" command acts like "local" when used inside a function. declare -A is required for associative arrays. bash 4.2 adds declare -g to suppress the "local" thing.

[23:14:38] <OnlineCop> The `help declare` gives me proper inputs for declare, but I don't see anything to explain the attributes. -A: associative array, -a: normal array, -x exported. Is there a 'man' or 'declare --help-full' or something to understand the remaining attributes (like --, -ar, -ir, -r, etc.)?
