[00:54:09] <wink> ^ easy: panel to the front
[00:54:14] <varjag> so i installed rust and a bunch of dependencies and built that hubris thing
[00:54:26] <varjag> now to find that stm32f4 board we had someplace
[00:54:31] <riv> fun!
[00:55:03] <varjag> what's incredible is how 2k sloc of rust compiles to like 2mb code
[00:55:15] <riv> lol
[00:55:26] <riv> does it have tcp?
[00:55:31] <riv> i couldn't figure this out
[00:55:32] <varjag> that's like, a factor of 1000x!
[00:55:36] <varjag> i don't think so
[00:55:42] <riv> that's interesting
[00:55:45] <riv> so this is really for micros
[00:55:55] <riv> just chatting over spi etc.
[00:55:57] <epilys> dependencies?
[00:56:03] <varjag> it's an interesting concept but bit green
[00:56:17] <varjag> can see in project structure they haven't done this much before
[00:56:36] <varjag> nothing big tho
[00:57:05] <varjag> epilys: to install crossplatform rust you get to download like petabyte of shit
[00:57:10] <varjag> (exaggerating)
[00:57:31] <epilys> I meant re: 2k sloc, does that include dependencies?
[00:58:00] <companion_cube> also, templates
[00:58:04] <varjag> ah, no
[00:58:17] <varjag> ythat's the os code itself
[00:58:58] <epilys> companion_cube, monomorphization
[00:59:08] <companion_cube> yeah
[00:59:31] <varjag> it doesn't appear to use much libraries, if any
[01:00:17] <varjag> my previous rust build was servo in like 2018
[01:00:24] <varjag> it segfaulted

[01:25:41] <gwozniak> if optimized, I mean
[01:28:44] <varjag> it's an embedded os targeting an
[01:28:53] <varjag> microcontroller
[01:29:00] <varjag> not sure what's there to build in debug
[01:29:23] <varjag> ok i looked it ain't debug supposedly
[01:29:40] <varjag> there is a separate dir for debug artifacts
