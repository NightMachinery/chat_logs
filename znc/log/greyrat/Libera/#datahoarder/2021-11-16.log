[22:06:44] <SoF> have people here already switched to Google Workspace from GSuite?
[22:06:51] <SoF> how's the 'unlimited' storage situation?
[22:09:17] <Snuupy> the canadian plans haven't been switched yet, interestingly enough
[22:18:01] <evilgohan2> Still rocking my olllllldddd Google Apps for Business grandfathered free account
[22:28:38] <SoF> nice.
[22:28:59] <SoF> it seems Workspace Enterprise Standard is still unlimited at just a small markup compared to GSuite

[22:53:39] <Snuupy> looks like grandfathered enterprise can't create shared drives
[22:53:48] <SoF> (taking my previous statement about enterprise back - it still "unlimited" in the sense of current GSuite Business)

[23:06:27] <Snuupy> https://outage.bingo/  hehehe
[23:06:50] <evilgohan2> interesting. My 2004 era first gmail account has 17GB of storage...
[23:07:10] <evilgohan2> Must've been from one of their security checkup days. I know it was at 100GB from a samsung promotion at one point but that expired
[23:08:22] <Snuupy> mine's 17 too (personal)
[23:08:28] <Snuupy> gsuite is 15 though
