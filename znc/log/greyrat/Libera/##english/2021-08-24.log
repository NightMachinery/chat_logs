[00:08:16] <paulo> !ety alter
[00:08:18] <tinsoldier> alter — late 14c., "to change (something), make different in some way," from Old French "alterer" "to change, alter," from Medieval Latin "alterare" "to change," from Latin "alter" "the other (of the two)," from PIE root "*al-" (1) "beyond" + comparative suffix "-ter" (as in "other"). Intransitive sense "to become otherwise" first recorded 1580s. Related: "Altered"; "altering"....
[00:08:27] <paulo> !ety other
[00:08:29] <tinsoldier> other — Old English "oÃ¾er" "second, the second of two; additional, further" (adj.), also as a pronoun, "one of the two; a different person or thing from the one in view," from Proto-Germanic "*anthera-" (source also of Old Saxon "athar", Old Frisian "other", Old Norse "annarr", Middle Dutch and Dutch "ander", Old High German "andar", German "ander", Gothic "anÃ¾ar" "second, other"). ...

[00:15:24] <StayHungry> modern 'politically correct' bible translations drive me crazy
[00:16:45] <blkshp> In the name of the parent, the child and the holy non-biological plasmodic lifeform.
[00:18:20] <StayHungry> e.g. 'strangers' in the passage 'The Lord watches over the strangers, he upholds the orphan and the widow, but the way of the wicked he brings to ruin' is now 'resident aliens'
[00:18:46] <StayHungry> resident aliens? wtf is this?
[00:19:07] <blkshp> People from other places, potentially immigrants that have leave to remain. 
[00:21:47] <dTal> That's interesting. Does that mean that "stranger" used to mean "someone from far away" rather than "someone you don't know"?
[00:22:00] <dTal> I suppose, at one time, they would have been synonymous.
[00:22:22] <blkshp> I believe so
[00:22:49] <dTal> So, someone who is strange in general

[01:30:33] <StayHungry> perhaps this is not entirely correct to refer to ancient Rome (500 BC — 476 AD), because the Psalms (where the quotation is taken from) are supposedly written before that, during the Babylonian captivity and earlier. but again, although there were non-Jews, I doubt they were narrowed down to non-Jews of the Jewish state in terms of 'immigrant' or 'resident alien' :)

[03:51:38] <eqw> I don't see any connection to 2 X'es
[03:51:40] <ksft> yes, so is "vax"
[03:52:02] <tinwhiskers> it's single letters becoming double letters. stop, stopping, etc
[03:52:19] <ksft> they're all one-syllable words ending with consonants, and in each case the last letter is doubled when an inflectional suffix is added
[03:52:46] <ksft> except the suffix -s, I guess
[03:53:03] <tinwhiskers> yeah and a thousand other exceptions
[03:53:17] <ksft> there are very few inflectional suffixes in English
[03:53:21] <ksft> like eight, I think
[03:53:22] <eqw> And suxx and vaxx are the only examples of such single-syllable words?
[03:53:33] <tinwhiskers> it's not vaxx though. It's vax.
[03:53:49] <tinwhiskers> anti-vax, anti-vaxxer. Stop, stopper.
[03:53:59] <ksft> the doubled X is unusual, but it probably comes from this same orthographic rule
[03:54:06] <tinwhiskers> yeah
[03:54:13] <tinwhiskers> X is just not a common letter :-/
[03:54:15] <OMGOMG> anti-vacc, anti-vaccer
[03:54:32] <ksft> here, unusually, the last letter represents two phonemes
[03:54:43] <eqw> so "vaxx" probably came from "anti-vaxxers"
[03:54:51] <tinwhiskers> maybe
[03:55:17] <ksft> I wouldn't be surprised if "vaxx" had become a common backformation from that
[03:55:25] <tinwhiskers> yeah
[03:55:52] <tinwhiskers> but it's still in a small minority as yet if you use google as an indicator.
[03:57:03] <ksft> my tense and mood might have been ambiguous there: what I meant was that I didn't know how common it was, but that if I were to find out it had a significant fraction of "vax"'s usage, I wouldn't be surprised
[03:57:20] <ksft> not that I was predicting that it will change in the future
[03:57:23] <papna> It isn't a one-syllable word thing -- worshipper, transmitter
[03:57:33] <ksft> good point
[03:57:34] <tinwhiskers> sure. Taken by me as intended.
[03:58:01] <tinwhiskers> papna: no, but long words are harder for my brain to find :-)
[03:59:02] <ksft> Google Ngrams has "vax" at a little under seven times as common as "vaxx"

[04:00:30] <papna> Why is commonwealth "enrol" but "marvellous"
[04:00:41] <papna> But American "enroll" and "marvelous"
[04:01:20] <tinwhiskers> presumably someone wanted to feel special :-)
[04:06:20] <ksft> I think "enrol" is the exception there
[04:06:38] <ksft> take "travel" or "cancel", for example
[04:08:40] <papna> extol
[04:08:58] <papna> Wait, that's always extol
[04:10:05] <papna> fulfil is like enrol
[04:11:39] <papna> And tons of words are like marvelous (traveled, leveled, etc.)

[19:55:17] <rud0lf> can "grumpy" be an opposite to "sincere"?
[19:55:32] <rud0lf> i'm trying to get a grip on the word "sincere"
[19:55:59] <rud0lf> like jokingly saying at the end of the message "your grumpy, T.J."
[19:56:11] <StayHungry> sincere is a beautiful word not to be overused
[19:59:06] <StayHungry> means something expressed is genuine

[20:02:32] <StayHungry> sincere gratitude - yes, sincere thanks - so-so
[20:02:58] <swarfega> sincere gratitude is like a more formal version of sincere thanks
[20:03:23] <StayHungry> that's the point, sincere is not meant for informal 'yo, bruh' :)

[20:09:58] <blkshp> "Yours sincerely"
[20:10:17] <swarfega> thats for letters tho
[20:10:18] <blkshp> It's somewhat used when sincerity is not the foremost of conditions regardless of it's usage.
[20:10:55] <blkshp> But it's still the habitual and potentially insincere use of the word "sincere" 
[20:11:35] <blkshp> However, in principal i would consider the use of "sincere" a use of "I'm not lying but"
[20:11:41] <swarfega> you can imagine gangs like in John Wick saying Sincere Gratitute
