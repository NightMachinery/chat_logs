[00:01:29] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> is there a way to see filebeat parsed output?
[00:02:10] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> i wonder if the logs would show anything
[00:03:00] <CableNinja> hurdy turn up debugging and watch the logs iirc
[00:03:45] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> alrighty, I'll give that a look
[00:04:00] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> trying to parse json files, so this'll be fun....
[00:04:59] <CableNinja> if you're trying to handle dealing with pulling specific tags, `jq` is a handy tool... EX: `jq '.thing' file.json` will look for .thing in the json data. can be helpful for figuring out where your tags are located / how to grab them
[00:05:21] <CableNinja> sorry I mean it will look for 'thing' in the root level of the json
[00:05:51] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> yeah i use jq for vault so i'm familiar with it. The big thing I'm worried about is the multiline
[00:09:42] <CableNinja> can you get the thing sending the json to not send multiline?
[00:09:48] <CableNinja> thats the easiest way to handle that lol
[00:09:58] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> unfortunately I don't think so
[00:10:30] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> the goal is to just support a "basic" or "traditional" install of the app so I don't think it'd be much of an option
[00:10:52] <CableNinja> is it an app you (your company) build/maintain?

[00:12:34] <CableNinja> yeah not familiar with that. I do remember nothing but pain and suffering with multiline json, mainly because the filebeat wasnt necessarily processing only one entry at a time
[00:12:56] <sd> 02<l​ocaIhost> how do I touch grass?
[00:13:21] <CableNinja> step 1) dont be inside
[00:13:24] <CableNinja> step 2) be outside
[00:13:31] <CableNinja> step 3) find some grass and touch it
[00:13:53] <sd> 02<l​ocaIhost> step 1 and 2 is impossible
[00:14:41] <CableNinja> you could always order a patch from home depot or your local garden store
[00:18:01] <thegodsquirrel> Be like a TikToker and just steal a lump of sod from your local park
[00:18:23] <CableNinja> but step 1 and 2 is impossible, that requires step 1 and 2
[00:19:16] <thegodsquirrel> Pay the TikTokers to steal it and bring it to you/

After the most recent updates, she's now being prompted for Ctrl-Alt-Del before she can use any login method (password, pin or biometric).
