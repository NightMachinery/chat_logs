However, the spec for v3 onions was released years before that. this leads me to suspect that the truncated checksum is totally unused and could be replaced with random data.

[13:49:55] <Wulf> but quite often ldap lookups are done following a kerberos authentication. That ldap lookup can detect that a user's rights were revoked.
[13:50:03] <dostoyevsky2> also, if the token/certifikate architecture is that automated, doesn't this make the api endpoints more vulnerable?  There might be ways to just access those directly...

[13:50:56] <Wulf> dostoyevsky2: are you talking about certificates? If you don't, then don't.
[13:51:13] <dostoyevsky2> I think kerberos calls them tickets, no?
[13:51:33] <Wulf> dostoyevsky2: yes. But certificates are something else.
[13:51:54] <Wulf> certificates use public key crypto, kerberos (usually) symmetric crypto only.

[19:34:22] <nullBlank> serious cryptography seems like its probably available on nostarchpress
[19:34:48] <snappy> also real world cryptography by david wong is newcomer and is probably very decent (author is pretty cool): https://www.manning.com/books/real-world-cryptography

[19:37:14] <nullBlank> is crypto the right way for information safety?
[19:37:58] <snappy> i don't know what you mean by information safety
[19:38:06] <iz> crypto won't keep information safe, but can keep it secret

[19:38:32] <nullBlank> yeah
[19:38:56] <nullBlank> i am kinda thinking like is there any other way than crypto to keep info secret
[19:39:36] <TimMc> of course
[19:39:37] <iz> sure, oppresive NDAs, just don't tell anyone, threats of death

[19:40:01] <nullBlank> whats an NDA?
[19:40:16] <TimMc> Non-disclosure agreement -- a type of contract.
[19:40:18] <nullBlank> oooh
[19:40:22] <iz> non-disclosure agreement, usually how corporations force secrets to be kept under threat of expensive lawsuit
[19:40:28] <nullBlank> yeah realized it later on lol
[19:40:59] <iz> threat of death is how organized crime tends to do it
[19:41:18] <nullBlank> I was required to sign one waaay back
[19:41:21] <iz> just don't tell anyone is how people who actually keep secrets do it

[19:42:58] <TimMc> nullBlank: But seriously, you'll want to use some combination of cryptography and access control.

[19:43:40] <nullBlank> cryptography has access control - those who have the keys... or part of the key
[19:43:51] <iz> what makes modern crypto so usable is something called https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle
[19:44:20] *** Lord_of_Life_ is now known as Lord_of_Life
[19:44:20] <iz> we can keep the information secret with just a small secret key, while everything else about the algorithm is public knowledge

[19:45:46] <nullBlank> im gonna go check on open source stuff and then check out the books
[19:45:59] <TimMc> If I release an encrypted message to the world, and then someone releases the key, then everyone can decrypt it.
[19:46:20] <TimMc> So, question for you: What's the difference between that scenario and someone just releasing the plaintext?
[19:46:32] <TimMc> (rather than the key)
[19:46:53] <nullBlank> those who have knowledge of the key can only decrypt the message
[19:47:17] <nullBlank> they also need to know the how of decryption
[19:48:17] <nullBlank> yet releasing the plain text only needs the guy to know the location of it

[19:49:10] <nullBlank> the time period before the key release is also a factor
[19:49:20] *** Joins: moose (~moose@user/moose)
[19:49:26] <TimMc> Well, the "how" is usually pretty straightforward, but it could be released with the key.
[19:49:38] <TimMc> The big difference is that if someone leaks the plaintext, it might be *deniable*.
[19:50:00] <TimMc> But if they leak the key, it's not deniable (if I had initially released the encrypted message under my own name).
[19:51:04] <nullBlank> deniable as in ownership wise?
[19:51:06] <TimMc> With access control, only those who are granted access can try cracking the message, or can confirm for themselves that I had "published" it.
[19:51:09] <TimMc> yeah
[19:51:23] <TimMc> so the two methods are complementary
[19:51:43] <nullBlank> okay nice yeah... you are talking about digital signatures?
[19:51:51] <TimMc> Even without signatures.
[19:52:09] <nullBlank> yeah of course
[19:52:15] <TimMc> Signatures *do* make the problem harder.
[19:54:01] <TimMc> By the way, signatures often conflate "no one tampered with this message" with "this message was created by this one person".
[19:54:39] <TimMc> Sometimes you want one and not the other. And sometimes you want deniable authorship. RSA signatures don't let you make those choices.
