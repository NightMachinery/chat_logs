[01:21:57] <NeuroWinter> Hello all, I am trying to store my docker file in the root of a directory, but have the build context inside another folder, I have managed to get it working with docker `docker build -f Dockerfile kTrain` But is there a way to do with this with docker-compose ?
[01:22:02] *** Joins: pycurious (~Adium@user/pycurious)
[01:23:00] <NeuroWinter> I have added `context` and `dockerfile` to the build section of the docker-compose file, but I keep getting `ERROR: the Dockerfile (Dockerfile) cannot be empty` when I try run docker-compose up --build 
[01:23:10] <tabakhase> compose-version?
[01:23:26] <tabakhase> allowing the file outside of the context is fairly "new" to docker...

[03:14:30] <jochum> Lutin: I don't know what the others do, but I realy like volumes in docker-compose.
[03:15:22] <jochum> For me the big difference between these two, volumes come from somewhere else on the system, while bindmounts are hard/relative paths to something.
[03:15:54] <jochum> I love that I don't have to care about stuff not owned by me in my path with volumes.

[03:18:53] <Lutin> but for FreeIPA for an example it's great to bindmount and you can check the logs right away

[03:19:24] <jochum> nice
[03:19:31] <jochum> Yeah, some stuff is good to have in the current path.

[19:35:34] <ada_> hackinghorn: its also a common pattern to check the ownership of the filesystem in a script before your application runs, and do the right thing to make it writable
[19:35:49] <ada_> hackinghorn: lots of images use the entrypoint script pattern, and that would be a fine place to put that logic

[22:10:09] <ada_> Lyn: docker engine supports writing secure secrets when you have swarm mode enabled, but not for plain containers
[22:10:24] <ada_> Lyn: compose doesn't have a fancy way to do what the containers API can't
[22:10:40] <ada_> Lyn: e.g. this is a docker engine question, doesn't involve compose 
[22:12:03] *** Joins: travisghansen (~travisgha@192.74.130.86)
[22:12:57] <ada_> Lyn: in swarm mode, docker engine can save your secret encrypted at rest, and decrypts inside your container in memory

[22:33:08] <dman777> artok: https://dpaste.org/GmQD#L2 here is what I have running on my local. I need to break it up into docker containers.... just to confirm... instead of 1 server block.... I will have 3 docker containers.... each one with thier own nginx server {} block? 
[22:39:00] <artok> I can't remember how nginx config was done..
[22:39:01] <ada_> I imagine that the "angular front end" is just a pile of js files, and doesn't run its own web server
[22:39:05] <ada_> hence why you put nginx in front of it
[22:39:17] <ada_> I imagine the node/express backend runs a node server, so that should be in its own container
[22:39:32] <ada_> so I only see an need for 1 nginx "frontend" container
[22:39:34] <ada_> not 3
[22:39:52] <gordonjcp> dman777: I'm doing something similar

[22:40:09] <artok> < artok> you have 2 nginx services, one for proxy, one for static files
[22:40:16] <ada_> dman777: think about your containers in terms of long-running processes
[22:40:26] <artok> and static files = angular app
[22:40:55] <ada_> why would you run a second one just to serve static content?
[22:41:47] <artok> for the configuration perspective of the proxy

[22:59:06] <gordonjcp> dman777: the way I do it is this - I have a container running a Flask app (this would be node.js in your case), a container running the database server, and a container running nginx which proxies the flask app and also serves static content including things like theme CSS and images, and daft stuff like robots.txt, favicon.ico and the like
[22:59:23] <gordonjcp> dman777: I used to run that directly onto the web, with my nginx container handling https too
[22:59:42] <gordonjcp> dman777: now I don't, and I proxy *that* with traefik which automagically copes with ssl
[23:03:21] <ash_worksi> I am confused as to why a file mounted with compose using `volumes:\n  - ./path/to/file:/path/on/container/file` does not update when I make changes to it on the host
[23:04:43] <artok> ash_worksi: is that on linux host or on some other and syncing is slow?
[23:04:51] <ash_worksi> like, I see the file where it's mounted, but when I make changes to it on the host and `cat` it in the container, the changes don't exist. I have to do `docker-compose down` + `docker-compose up -d` again

[23:07:01] <artok> what i'd recommend is to use full paths

[23:08:55] <artok> file mount happens on inode base, and when you edit and save on some occasions, inode changes and container doesn't know about it
[23:08:57] <clime> is it normal that docker import replaces /etc (a symlink in the original tarball)? with a new dir?

[23:10:17] <Lutin> artok what is the usecase ? can't see it that fast :D
[23:11:43] <artok> Lutin: what where?
[23:12:05] <Lutin> artok about the inodebase and things
[23:12:43] <ash_worksi> artok: I've never had this happen to me before.. it's very weird, but I'm using the `sqitch/sqitch` image which seems to be intended to be more tightly coupled to the host than one might think
[23:12:51] <ash_worksi> I'll ask about debugging later
[23:12:52] <artok> ash_worksi most of editors (like vim..) create new file into tmp dir and you edit that, and when you save, it will do remove+rename
[23:13:08] <Lutin> artok it does ?
[23:13:11] <ash_worksi> artok: hmm... again, I've never had a problem with it before
[23:13:13] <artok> there is setting for that also
[23:13:16] <Lutin> I thought just overwrte
[23:13:31] <artok> ash_worksi: if you mount directories, there is no problem
[23:14:29] <artok> this is something that I just remembered from some part of my brain, I haven't yet searched for confirmation from docker docs
