[00:15:42] <Urchin[emacs]> I'm currently reading about abolition of slavery in the British Empire
[00:16:10] <Urchin[emacs]> which is interesting because the activists actually succeeded
[00:22:34] <Llamamoe> Well revolution is also success for activism, just a partial one

[01:08:14] <dmnslr00> hes sort of really famous
[01:08:45] <NotNewNotNew> well its counter intuitive the things he wrote. did you guys study about him in school what did u learn
[01:10:24] <dmnslr00> How am I supposed to recall the aspects of what I learn decades ago.
[01:10:33] <dmnslr00> ive got too much content to maintain as it is.
[01:10:35] <NotNewNotNew> slavery was still very mainstream by the time the USA/UK abolished it. 
[01:10:57] <NotNewNotNew> it was thanks to their efforts that it was rooted out internationally, middle east, north africa, and asia it was very common. 
[01:12:01] <NotNewNotNew> the word slave comes from the term "slav"
[01:12:59] <NotNewNotNew> when we talk about slavery hardly anyone considers the history of it, or what a big part of our history slavery was
[01:14:15] <NotNewNotNew> ive such a big job thats waiting for me tomorrow, i wish I could just cancel lol

[06:53:12] <amigojapan> JesseDesu: the weirdest thing is that there was another strong earthquake(the one that damaged my building) exactly on the same day off the year as the 1985 earthquake. In what was it? 2017?
[06:53:26] <JesseDesu> whoa
[06:53:33] <JesseDesu> the universe remembers
[06:53:42] <ButterNoodle> I use the libert 2200 and the triplite 3kv for the network stuff and servers

[06:54:06] <JesseDesu> 9000 to 35000 people died
[06:54:12] <ButterNoodle> PCs have a bit of a buffer built in the psu's to deal with dog shit dirty utility power

[07:59:18] <Satin> but getline shalt solve this issue..
[07:59:34] <isekaijin> Oh, interestingly, C's getline() calls realloc() for you when the buffer is too small, so it should be more or less as easy to use as C++'s std::getline.

[08:49:49] <Satin> it's not a typical art thingy for sure
[08:49:56] <Satin> so it's hard to judge as being "good" or "bad"
[08:49:59] <bxgelsan> Satin, its what its like to go to hell.
[08:50:09] <Satin> but i'm judging it based on how my brain percieves it
[08:50:13] <Satin> abstract hard is hard to judge
[08:50:19] <Satin> and my judgement is this: it's fun to look at.
[08:50:27] <bxgelsan> yeah, abstract is theraputic and my thing.
[08:50:28] <Satin> it feels a bit schizo ngl
[08:50:31] <JesseDesu> it looks like jackson pollock and edvard munch had a baby and painted on a brick wall background using an ipad

[09:27:28] <Satin> humans, i tell you

[09:28:05] <JesseDesu> i am sorry
[09:28:19] <Satin> you're not being bad
[09:28:24] <Satin> but you are not having a filter
[09:28:26] <JesseDesu> just a dick?
[09:28:36] <Satin> a filter is very important in social situations like these
[09:28:41] <Satin> like when she was around earlier
[09:28:51] <Satin> anyone except you, including me and nanobot could tell she was getting tense
[09:29:01] <Satin> and you weren't helping by making the statements and messages you were
[09:29:16] <Satin> even though you meant no harm at all and from your point of view, were probably just being random
[09:29:21] <Satin> but
[09:29:21] <Satin> yeahn
[09:29:33] <JesseDesu> so you think i'm really schizzo
[09:29:41] <JesseDesu> schizo affective disorder
[09:29:44] <Satin> no i don't 
[09:30:02] <Satin> schizo to me, is shorthand for things that are perhaps a bit out of norm
[09:30:04] <Satin> it is slang
[09:30:10] <JesseDesu> its a real thing tho
[09:30:15] <JesseDesu> its closely related to bp1
[09:30:15] <Satin> i do not think you literally have that condition
[09:30:24] <JesseDesu> well you could be right
[09:30:26] <Nanobot> Considering the context, the "looks like a guy in a dress" thing was really insensitive.

[09:31:02] <JesseDesu> i'm sorry
[09:31:18] <Satin> not us you should be apologizing us to

[09:31:25] <JesseDesu> well who then
[09:31:44] <JesseDesu> maybe you're right
[09:31:48] <JesseDesu> i am random

[09:31:56] <JesseDesu> i didnt calculate

[16:58:49] <ezekielnoob> 100-200 pesos for a meal
[16:58:52] <Terminus> but i also threw some budget places in my list. like mensakaba and yamazaki are both in the $5 range.
[16:58:58] <Sadale> Here if you actually look for that you can find meal that costs $3-$4. They're not easy to find tho
[16:59:09] <Sadale> ah. $4 sounds reasonable :3
[16:59:21] <Sadale> That's as expensive as Mcdonalds here.

[17:40:01] <dfch> amigojapan, ordinary throat swab, all the time, without any discomfort.
[17:40:23] <Zoidberg> amigojapan: staying in hostels, meeting different people and visiting new places..
[17:40:25] <amigojapan> Ah good dfch 
[17:40:41] <amigojapan> Yup Zoidberg 
[17:40:44] <Zoidberg> Sadale: same!!
[17:40:50] <Sadale> dfch, Does the people there treat foreigner differently?
[17:41:02] <Sadale> dfch, For COVID arrangement
[17:41:13] <amigojapan> Zoidberg: last time we just went to the beach for 2 weeks
[17:41:17] <Sadale> would people like giving weird look at you?
[17:41:39] <Zoidberg> yeah, I remember amigojapan, a bird attacked you!
[17:41:59] <amigojapan> Yeah Zoidberg that happened
[17:42:01] <dfch> amigojapan, also not really a cardiopulmonary resuscitation test, you probably meant PCR (NAT) test
[17:42:32] <amigojapan> Yes that's what I meant, sorry dfch 
[17:42:38] <Zoidberg> Sadale: I don't think you'd look like foreigner anywhere in asia
[17:42:42] <Sadale> If I were amigojapan I'd catch the bird, roast it and eat it :3
[17:42:58] <Sadale> Zoidberg, not really. I'd look noticeable whiter in India
[17:43:15] <Sadale> And I'd look noticiably darker in Japan
[17:43:15] <dfch> Sadale, personally? not really I heard couple of anecdotes but in most cases they were the assholes, got plenty of those (not the prevention stuff).
[17:43:29] <Terminus> Sadale: nope! but i'm with locals so they do the ordering. food good. didn't care what arrived. 😀
[17:43:35] <Zoidberg> Sadale: there are whiter indians too, in the north, a lot of them
[17:43:38] <Zoidberg> Sadale: not new
[17:44:01] <Sadale> Zoidberg, ah right. But in places like Japan tho chances are that I'll look darker.
[17:44:12] <Sadale> Zoidberg, Just like how I could recognize Japanese people here like immediately
[17:44:15] <Sadale> Japanese or Korean.
[17:44:15] <darkwitch> you probably did not mean "anal swan" either (poor bird)
[17:44:17] <Sadale> They're whiter
[17:44:18] <Terminus> was checking for flights to HK. cheapest i could find is ~$245 end of april.
[17:44:19] <Zoidberg> Sadale: and there are also people who look like chinese in north east, just can't tell
[17:44:30] <Sadale> Terminus, come over here! :3
[17:44:31] <dfch> Sadale, I mean I do get a little bit more leeway than locals, but it offset by more scrutiny over some simple stuff locals don't deal with sometimes. But again in general, same shit.
[17:44:36] <Sadale> Terminus, Then you can receive my licks :3
[17:44:38] <amigojapan> Lol darkwitch swab*
[17:44:59] <Terminus> Sadale: oh no you don't. plane tickets are one thing, staying in HK is gonna cost me much more! 🤣
[17:45:00] <Sadale> dfch, I see. Interesting :3
[17:45:13] <Sadale> Terminus, awww :3
[17:45:14] <Terminus> i could just spend the money on taking bearbeer to a nice beach vacation.
[17:45:15] <dfch> Test if needed, lockdown if needed, etc. All policies applied the same to everyone, otherwise there's no point in those innit
[17:45:16] <Zoidberg> yeah, still it's not much of a problem mostly Sadale
[17:45:31] <amigojapan> darkwitch: I was understood despite my autocorrect mistakes
[17:45:36] <Sadale> Zoidberg, depends. Some people are racists. :/
[17:45:58] <luke-jr> dfch: people are too stupid for that
[17:46:15] <Zoidberg> Sadale: you have them in every nation
[17:46:22] <Sadale> true
[17:46:39] <Zoidberg> but most of them are decent enough

[17:47:19] <amigojapan> luke-jr: seems you can get up to 7 years in Jain for not complying
[17:47:26] <dfch> luke-jr, stupid for what exactly? for following policies? or for implementing the right ones
[17:47:32] * Sadale clicks on Terminus's link

[17:47:43] <darkwitch> and there came the next typo
[17:48:03] <amigojapan> Jail*
[17:48:21] <Sadale> Terminus, lol I'd rather to travel around right inside your houses for lulz. :P
[17:48:38] <luke-jr> dfch: both
[17:49:00] <luke-jr> at least in America
[17:49:06] <Zoidberg> I keep my room fairly neat
[17:49:23] <Zoidberg> same with other rooms
[17:49:30] <Sadale> mine's bad :(
[17:49:32] <dfch> luke-jr I cant argue for implementing, but if you not complying you also could go in jail up to 10 years. Something something asian society, add authoritarianism on top of that. So there's no option left for not following on those
[17:49:42] <Terminus> Sadale: i'm gonna need to check on how much to charge you. 😂
[17:50:03] <amigojapan> luke-jr: in America people would shoot others if they were forced to get PCR tests
[17:50:46] <dfch> luke-jr, ah, it's completely different here, I do agree with people are stupid sentiment (it's universal lol). Especially en masse, but they got very good at controlling the masses here in china.
[17:50:50] <Terminus> my solution to PCR tests. don't do anything that requires a PCR test. which explains why i haven't been on a plane for 2 years.
[17:51:10] <Sadale> dfch, 這個可恥的洋鬼子對我們偉大的祖國的政策説三道四! 不要跟他做朋友! :P
[17:51:11] <Zoidberg> woah Sadale 
[17:51:12] <darkwitch> 7 years in Jain for refusing to carry a gun
[17:51:18] <Sadale> Terminus, haha
[17:51:27] <amigojapan> Terminus: they are forcing everyone in China to get them
[17:51:29] <Terminus> i have no problem taking a PCR test but i do have a problem with paying for one!
[17:51:49] <amigojapan> Lol darkwitch 
[17:52:02] <darkwitch> Jain is that odd university in bang a lore
[17:52:10] <luke-jr> amigojapan: like held down forced?
[17:52:17] <Sadale> I think that PCR test isn't universal in China. It's only required on designated cities
[17:52:19] <Zoidberg> I don't even know what a pcr test is
[17:52:20] <Zoidberg> later
[17:52:24] <Terminus> wait, i did get forced to pay for a test last year. had to go to the ER and hospital won't let me into the ER until i have a test done.
[17:52:32] <amigojapan> luke-jr: like it is illegal not to get it
[17:52:50] <dfch> Terminus, last week, in our city new law, EVERYONE (with exception of under 3yo and people who just got vaccine) had to do 3 tests. Locking up home wouldn't help either, state grid workers with police would get you anyway
[17:52:55] <Sadale> Terminus, damn. That's so stupid
[17:52:56] <dfch> luke-jr, here, yes
[17:53:33] <luke-jr> well, the violate-human-rights extreme is arguably even worse
[17:53:47] <Sadale> dfch, ah I've heard about the grid system in mainland China. Actually how does that reeally work? Do they keep a list of people who's inside each zone inside a grid?
[17:54:01] <Terminus> dfch: i hope they're at least paying for the tests. i'd fail on reporting because i'd likely be asleep on mandatory reporting times.
[17:54:26] <Sadale> dfch, I don't recall getting registered in the grid system while travelling to mainland China. Maybe they don't care about tourists/temporary travellers? :/

[17:55:03] <Sadale> :D
[17:55:07] <Sadale> Satin, thanks :D
[17:55:12] <amigojapan> luke-jr: seems they stopped doing it, but at a certain point it seems they were doing anal swabs in China, this may be a while ago

[17:55:58] <dfch> amigojapan, not to local population
[17:56:03] <Zoidberg> btw Sadale, you could go for masters in business management in PH. I forgot PH has some pretty good uni.

[17:56:59] <Sadale> Zoidberg, the opportunity cost's huge for me. I'd have to stop doing my day job to study. And my day job pays not bad at all

[17:58:17] <Sadale> More importantly, it doesn't mean that it'll land you in a decent management job that pays weell

[17:58:52] <amigojapan> dfch: altho if the nose swab Hursts as much as the flu test I had, anal swabs may be less painful, dunno
[17:59:10] <Sadale> In fact those workplaces that'd hire you just because you got a management master degree is the kind of workplace that I'd avoid.
[17:59:20] <dfch> amigojapan, anal swab is the most painless some would argue
[17:59:27] <Sadale> (unless they pay exceptionall well of course)

[21:49:47] <JesseDesu> i had a diagram of the notes in front of me
[21:49:58] <JesseDesu> i found out it sounds better if i leave out a note
[21:50:10] <Fenderbassist> cool
[21:50:14] <Fenderbassist> works like that sometimes
[21:50:20] <JesseDesu> or if i do play this particular note, it only sounds good in certain chord combinations
[21:50:27] <Fenderbassist> that's good
[21:50:30] <JesseDesu> i dont know why but musically it works

[21:53:02] <JesseDesu> the thing with the resolving note
[21:53:20] <JesseDesu> you pick out random notes that dance around it
[21:53:37] <JesseDesu> then when you're ready to resolve, end a phrase with it
[21:55:06] <JesseDesu> my brain cant seem to memorize a 7 tone scale

[22:28:47] <ChoHag> It's just that ISTR last time I checked the last episode was scheduled to have been released by now, which means the dubbed version he needs (because kids and/or xbox I don't question) should be ready.
[22:29:02] <ChoHag> But since I'm so far removed from the scene I've no idea and I can only tell him it's not available.

[22:48:16] <ChoHag> lol viz?
[22:49:06] <ChoHag> Was Viz well known in the US in the 80s/90s?
[22:49:26] <emmeka> ChoHag the basic status of legal anime streaming right now is that Crunchyroll is the main platform, its former major competitor, Funimation, just merged into it. Besides that, there is Hidive, which is Sentai Filmworks' platform and has all their stuff. Besides that, Netflix exclusively licenses some anime.
[22:49:43] <emmeka> between the three, you have about 95% of all extent anime streamable in some form.
[22:49:48] <mixfix41> viz is the new household husband
[22:50:18] <emmeka> ChoHag in the 80s Viz got laughed away by investors for thinking they could sell Japanese comics to Americans. But they got big towards the tail end of the 90s.

[22:57:59] <emmeka> ChoHag about piracy... so basically fansubbing (people who would fan-translate anime from Japan, which in ye olde days was the only way to watch 95% of anime) mostly died off when simulcasting became a thing.
[22:58:49] <emmeka> ChoHag basically, the legal licensors got fast at translating, and nowadays almost everything comes out subtitled in English as its release in Japan
[22:59:30] <emmeka> ChoHag however, piracy of anime is alive and well in the form of people who just rip from legal streaming website, occasionally improving upon the quick simulcast subs by fixing typos, doing typesetting, all that.
[23:00:05] <emmeka> and there *are* still fansubbers who exist, thanks almost entirely to Netflix who is generally terrible and slow at subbing anime.

[23:07:20] <Poeticode> i'm literally gonna wait a year or so for NovaWorks to finish fansubbing Komi Can't Communicate 'cuz a lot of stuff isn't subbed in the official ones
[23:07:34] <ChoHag> So that explains why the torrent directories are generally a mess.
[23:07:56] <MootPoot> Poeticode: with that much time you could learn the way of the moon runes
[23:08:17] <ChoHag> The anime used to be so well organised :(
[23:08:26] <Bco1981> runes don't make sound. he needs to learn to listen to nihongo
[23:08:36] <Jigsy> We still need proper BD encodes in this day and age.
[23:08:39] <Jigsy> 'cause fuck censorship.
[23:08:40] <Bco1981> and skip subs all together
[23:08:56] <Bco1981> Jigsy: raw
[23:09:12] <ChoHag> Bco1981: I generally prefer subbed foreign films to dubbed ones.
[23:09:12] <Jigsy> 3>but iT'S ONlY mINor ceNSorshIp. IT Doesn'T EffecT thE sTory iN aNY Way. IF yoU'RE HorNy, JUsT GO LOok aT POrN.
[23:09:33] <Bco1981> ChoHag: agree, but subs still don't translate 1:1
[23:09:40] <ChoHag> As does he, but his xbox player apparently can't handle such complex things as embedded subtitles.
[23:09:53] <Jigsy> I still find it odd how stuff doesn't support .ass in 2022.
[23:09:56] <ChoHag> Well what does?
[23:10:01] <Jigsy> Like Blu-ray or whatever.

[23:10:09] <Jigsy> PGS subs suck. VobSubs suck. SRT sucks.
[23:10:25] <Jigsy> Though SRT does support HTML iirc.
[23:10:31] <Jigsy> So, there's that.

[23:12:12] <Jigsy> I've got a shitload of stuff on my backlog at the moment anyway.
[23:12:22] <Jigsy> Started loli Japanese chess yesterday.

[23:13:40] <Sxem> i own 88 og xbox games, 15 gamecube, 15 3do, 15 ps1, 15 atari jaguar. usually, i stopped myself from getting them after 15. 
[23:14:01] <Bco1981> nice... i google loli Japanese chess and get a "abusing kids is a crime" as the first hit
[23:14:15] <Poeticode> mmm this green tea with rose petals is perfection
[23:16:28] <Sxem> whew, i realized too late that my 2nd line made me look like a pedophile, but it looks like no one noticed

[23:18:13] <Sxem> im surprised how many of my old retro console games have their case and manual. that makes them worth a lot more. 
[23:18:39] <Bco1981> because i hate returning bottles to get return money... the kids can do that... and use the money to what ever they want.

[23:27:16] <MootPoot> new witcher game
[23:30:55] <vegii> is it the time when I make a fucking 4chan post to get over getting ghosted
[23:32:31] <vegii> I'll probably get called a beta and summon some incels calling women femoids
[23:33:30] <vegii> so anyway
[23:37:31] <MootPoot> I should shower
[23:37:38] <S_T_A_N> naw
[23:37:41] <vegii> the uncertainty whether she got home safely and regretting not thinking about offering her a lift are killing me
[23:37:57] <vegii> *not thinking of
[23:38:04] <vegii> lost track of time
[23:39:09] <ChoHag> What's ghosted now?
[23:39:41] <vegii> when the person just stops responding and reading messages
[23:40:48] <vegii> or blocks you, but not necessarily so
[23:42:25] <emmeka> Poeticode same (about Komi-san)
[23:43:22] <MootPoot> psh
[23:43:27] <MootPoot> I signed up for a dating app
[23:43:42] <vegii> MootPoot: now?
[23:43:52] <MootPoot> 1 week later and about 5000 women later I still haven't had a single women to talk to me
[23:44:00] <MootPoot> not even ghost
[23:44:09] <MootPoot> vegii: its been a little bit
[23:44:24] <MootPoot> I think I've decided on being a basement dweller
[23:44:45] <vegii> MootPoot: which app?
[23:45:06] <MootPoot> the one which is yellow and works like tinder
[23:45:11] <MootPoot> but is not tinder
[23:45:29] <vegii> I have no idea if that's grinder or not
[23:45:33] <MootPoot> lol
[23:45:45] <MootPoot> only way I'm going on there is if I get gender swapped
[23:46:04] <vegii> wait whaat
[23:46:08] * Jigsy ponders a dating app for old women called Spinstr.
[23:46:26] <Jigsy> Gotta have that missing vowel.
[23:46:38] <emmeka> MootPoot gender swapped? Grindr is for gay men.
[23:47:06] <vegii> tindr
[23:47:26] <Urchin[emacs]> にゃー
[23:47:31] <MootPoot> emmeka: there is no lesbian option on there?
[23:47:38] <MootPoot> I thought it was for anything gay
[23:47:41] <MootPoot> damn
[23:48:08] <MootPoot> I guess if I get gender swapped I'll just PM Urchin[emacs] and ask him to set me up with some cute girls
[23:48:10] <Urchin[emacs]> lesbian options usually end up clogged with unicorn hunters
[23:48:30] <emmeka> I mean as far as I know it's targetted pretty exclusively at men
[23:48:43] <MootPoot> the demographics of grindr aside
[23:48:54] <vegii> wtf are unicorn hunters
[23:48:56] <MootPoot> I now have solid proof I will effectively be a wizard 
[23:49:18] <MootPoot> and not attain ascendance like emmeka - who has a wife who watches anime
[23:49:43] <MootPoot> so how long till they make cute girl robots
[23:49:54] <Nanobot> I ordered pizza. I never received the confirmation email (which, strangely, is the only place we're ever told the delivery time estimate). The delivery person left the pizza at my door without knocking or ringing the doorbell. I only saw it because I checked on a whim after feeling like the pizza was taking a really long time. I have no idea how long it's been sitting out there.
[23:49:57] <Jigsy> Import a cute girl robot from Japan.
[23:50:17] <Jigsy> Though you can hear the harpies shrieking about "fetishizing Japanese women."
[23:50:21] <emmeka> doesn't sound like very solid proof. isn't this the normal dating app experience. very heavy imbalance between genders with women generally overwhelmed with dicks being thrown at them from every direction, allowing them to select only the choicest pp's
[23:50:48] <Jigsy> I'm getting tired of other people and their stupid BS mental gymnastics.
[23:50:50] <MootPoot> !c 5000/1

[23:51:02] <Jigsy> And if I don't, I'm a racist...
