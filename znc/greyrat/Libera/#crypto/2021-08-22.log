[00:03:56] <TheWild> ok, forget encryption.
[00:03:56] <TheWild> boom, we have two functions, d and e, such that d(e(x)) = x and e(d(x)) = x and that it's not computationally-easy to obtain d from e.
[00:03:56] <TheWild> RSA does implement such interface. Does ECC implement such an interface too?
[00:04:46] <yawkat> no
[00:04:58] <Peng> "ECC" isn't very specific
[00:05:40] <yawkat> yea, it just means "elliptic curve cryptography". but i dont know any ecc algo that does.

[00:06:46] <ms7821> this is a super weird argument
[00:08:03] <sonOfRa> TheWild: the property that "signing is just encryption with the private key" is something that really only works for RSA, not for other cryptosystems. RSA being the de facto standard for such a long time has seeped into substandard teaching materials that imply that this is always the case
[00:08:03] *** Joins: Lord_of_Life (~Lord@user/lord-of-life/x-2819915)
[00:09:32] <yawkat> Yes, and that is what danieldg meant by "rsa-centric" earlier. 
[00:09:55] <yawkat> RSA is pretty unique in this regard. 
[00:11:44] <TheWild> what interface would be non-rsa-centric?
[00:11:49] <yawkat> I guess "trapdoor permutation" is a way to describe rsa, and it's the only instantiation of this class of algos that is in practical use
[00:11:52] *** Joins: Lord_of_Life_ (~Lord@user/lord-of-life/x-2819915)
[00:11:59] <yawkat> Schnorr signatures. 
[00:12:16] <TheWild> forget d and e and let's have functions sign and verify, such that signature = sign(data) and is_correct = verify(data, signature) (is_correct is boolean). Is this fair enough?

[00:19:10] <Peng> "ECC" isn't very specific
[00:19:11] <danieldg> nor does non-ecc DSA
[00:19:38] <TheWild> hmm... interesting. I didn't know math can do sign and verify without d and e.
[00:20:10] <ms7821> hash-based signatures exist

[00:21:40] <TheWild> ms7821: yeah, but I thought hash-based signatures are about: signature = d(hash+padding) and e(signature) (then strip padding of course)
[00:22:04] <TheWild> thanks for discussion, it gave me some insights
[00:22:21] <wagga> I have a luks encrypted disk that I can decrypt with cryptsetup version 2.3.6, but when I try to decrypt the same disk with cryptsetup 2.3.4 it complains that no key could be found with the pass phrase. What might explain that?
[00:23:31] <danieldg> wagga: missing algorithm support?
[00:24:16] *** Quits: zro (~zro@user/zro) (Quit: WeeChat 3.2)
[00:24:35] <TheWild> by the way, is there some magic such that sign and verify could be used for a key agreement (e.g. for symmetric cipher)?
[00:25:43] <wagga> the disks were originally encrypted in 2017, I am not sure what version of cryptsetup was used at the time, but I would guess that 2.3.4 would support the same algorithms. However, I am going to investigate that. Maybe I need to load a kernel module to get the support.
[00:26:03] <wagga> Thanks for the idea danieldg. I will investigate.

[18:29:04] <Peng> Oh good, $software *used* to always generate keys with a CSPRNG. Then they changed the implementation for no reason(?) so it *sometimes* uses a CSPRNG.

[20:16:29] <^-^hi> if someone controls both my dns and one certificate authority trusted by my browser, they can phish me?
[20:17:20] <Peng> Sure, I suppose. They would probably get caught.
[20:22:52] <Platonides> they don't even need to control one certificate authority
[20:23:18] <Platonides> by controlling your dns, they could make a legit CA think they are the site owner
[20:23:26] <woggle> What we usually think of as phishing attacks doesn't require that level of sophistication, since confusingly similar domains are often good enough.
[20:23:45] <Platonides> albeit the certificate isued for them should get recorded in the transparency logs
[20:24:06] <Platonides> or even dissimilar urls :(
[20:24:23] <^-^hi> Platonides, imagine only this dns is controlled by them
[20:24:28] <woggle> They'd need to control a legit CA's DNS, which is probably more challenging than common end-user DNS.
[20:24:32] <^-^hi> and they only want to fool me
[20:25:13] <Platonides> ah
[20:25:24] <Platonides> your dns as in the setting in your user machine
