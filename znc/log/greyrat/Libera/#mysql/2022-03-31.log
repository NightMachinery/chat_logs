[03:34:45] <tester12> I need a query like this but its not a real and executable
[03:35:10] <ss23> where (checkid = w8235hybr43 and key = B0000000000000000033355112777222) or (checkid = y822tb75s5v and key = '')

[03:51:23] <thumbs> tester12: you cannot use = with NULL. Use WHERE col IS NULL or WHERE col IS NOT NULL
[03:51:45] <tester12> just when remove key='', has result with key column and null value and another with value,  But I need check if key was empty
[03:52:00] <thumbs> tester12: you need to use valid SQL for starters
[03:52:14] <tester12> thumbs I have multiple conditions
[03:52:28] <thumbs> tester12: you still need to use valid SQL
[03:52:48] <Xgc> tester12: Regarding your first question:  ... WHERE (x, y) IN (('xxx', 'yyy'), ('xxx2', 'yyy2'))...   but that doesn't handle nulls, but does handle ''.
[03:53:11] <tester12> thanks
[03:54:10] <Xgc> tester12: The nulls can be handled easily if you have a non-null value that is never used.
[03:54:18] <tester12> thumbs replace ='' with IS NULL and its work
[03:54:51] <Xgc> Sure.  You can do that too.
[03:54:53] <tester12> Xgc doesnt work for OR and just is for AND
[03:55:13] <Xgc> tester12: No.  IN list is an OR list.
[03:57:01] <tester12> WHERE (x, y) IN (('xxx', 'yyy'), ('xxx2', 'yyy2'))
[03:57:11] <tester12> I test it but doesnt work
[03:57:28] <Xgc> tester12: It does.  So you need to define what "doesn't work" means.
[03:57:55] <Xgc> tester12: Provide a complete test case with data that "doesn't work"
[03:58:08] <Xgc> tester12: Is any of your values NULL ?
[03:58:34] <Xgc> tester12: NULL doesn't work for these things, directly.  IN is an equals test.
[03:58:57] <tester12> where (checkid ,key ) IN ( ( 'w8235hybr43' ,  'B0000000000000000033355112777222') or ('y822tb75s5v', ''))
[03:58:59] <Xgc> tester12: Remember, your first example was non-null values.
[03:59:09] <Xgc> tester12: '' is not a NULL
[03:59:25] <tester12> yes is null one of them
[03:59:41] <Xgc> tester12: No. There are no nulls in your example.
[03:59:50] <Xgc> tester12: '' is NOT a NULL
[04:00:17] <Xgc> tester12: Part of learning SQL is understanding this.
[04:00:28] <tester12> I explain it a little top
[04:00:35] <tester12> yes
[04:00:39] <tester12> thanks
[04:01:03] <tester12> suggestion of thumbs worked and its good
[04:01:16] <tester12> thank you Xgc too
[04:01:25] <Xgc> Oracle is an exception.  It has non-standard behavior, where '' IS NULL  yields true.  But no other database does this.

[19:14:51] <thumbs> a primary key is unique, by definition
[19:19:54] <Naktibalda> yes, if the primary key consists of a single column
[19:28:19] <arash> there is a table with more than one column with primary key and there are duplicate numbers on that column.
[19:31:43] <thumbs> a composite primary key can only guarantee unique tuples
[19:32:03] <thumbs> however, you can add another secondary unique key/index to prevent the issue you are describing
[19:33:05] <Naktibalda> then that field will be the real primary key
[19:33:11] <thumbs> indeed
[19:33:48] <thumbs> either way, if you want that single column to be the PK, you'll have to eliminate the duplicates first
