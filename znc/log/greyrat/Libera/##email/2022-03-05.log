[02:42:40] <sm> g'day all
[02:44:04] <sm> I'd like to ask for help understanding a low score from mail-tester.com. Is it reasonable to share the exact mail server hostname/ip here, or should I keep it generic ?
[02:53:36] <rob0> if you want us to see the same thing you're seeing, you should share the hostname.
[02:53:58] <rob0> If you're afraid of your shadow, you might want to mung it.
[02:54:17] <rob0> !example
[02:54:18] <dig-dug> rob0: example: Example.TLD has been reserved for examples in generic top-level domains (com,net,org) and many other TLDs. Please do not use real Internet names as examples.
[02:56:10] <sm> thanks. I assume "my shadow" is the colloquial term and not some well known mail server exploit :)
[02:56:45] <sm> it seems maybe something has regressed in our dns config. Eg it says "We didn't find a mail server (MX Record) behind your domain name mail.championwindows.biz.". 
[02:57:18] <Friithian> https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/afraid+of+his+own+shadow
[02:57:19] <sm> and I struggle to read dig output. I guess it finds an mx record for championwindows.biz but not for mail.championwindows.biz
[02:58:42] <sm> which I don't quite understand, since the linode DNS screen, MX Record section, mail.championwindows.biz is listed
[02:59:25] <sm> I have mail.championwindows.biz in their "Mail Server" field, and nothing in the "Subdomain" field
[03:02:11] <rob0> you are wanting to receive mail for addresses@championwindows.biz ?
[03:02:31] <sm> yes, and we do
[03:03:33] <sm> and we send mail from addresses@championwindows.biz. But the hostname of the mail server is mail.championwindows.biz, which seems to be a headache now and then
[03:04:26] <rob0> why?
[03:05:13] <sm> why is it a headache ? I don't know. Maybe it's the normal setup
[03:05:30] <rob0> $ host $( dig mail.championwindows.biz +short )
[03:05:32] <rob0> 63.54.33.45.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer mail.championwindows.biz.y
[03:05:41] <rob0> oops extra "y"
[03:05:59] <rob0> looks okay to me other than that
[03:06:57] <rob0> oh, I guess you are saying this mail-tester thing does not like it?
[03:07:03] <sm> the y was your typo I guess. Yes, it looks fine right ?
[03:07:19] <sm> yes. Also, https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=mx%3amail.championwindows.biz&run=toolpage is saying no dns record found
[03:07:24] <rob0> you have good FCrDNS
[03:08:26] <rob0> why are you checking mail.championwindows.biz if you are using @championwindows.biz ?
[03:09:55] <sm> well I'm checking both, as usual in these cases... mail.championwindows.biz is the one mail-tester is complaining about
[03:10:03] <sm> maybe you can see this: https://www.mail-tester.com/test-899cyw1mq
