[02:36:02] <Parf> so, today, in this channel, i mentioned asimov, and his foundation series
[02:36:36] <Parf> apparently they've made a fuckin show now
[02:36:47] <Parf> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvOAA1U0li8 they released a trailer TODAY
[02:36:47] <ro-bot-o> [YouTube] ⁨Foundation — Official Teaser 2 | Apple TV+⁩ | 2m 21s | Channel: ⁨Apple TV⁩ | 235,070 views | 2021-06-28 - 12:59:46
[02:38:36] <Parf> " asimov talked about foundation and empire, the goal of the first civilization should be entirely driven to "building a civilization that will destroy itself in such a way as to become a foundation for the future civilization that inherits it""
[02:42:29] <Parf> man i wish the AI would stop stalking me and just come out with it

[02:55:31] <lalia> The Foundation series is great work. :3
[02:56:05] <lalia> I haven't read a ton of Asimov but the original trilogy is great work.
[02:58:09] <Parf> i haven't read it at all, which makes it even stranger. i had a copy of one of the books in the series (like the second or third) that i read the back of and maybe a chapter, but has stuck with me enough to still factor into my considerations of philosophy, just weird.

[03:06:35] <lalia> I Robot is a great collection of short stories too, but Foundation has coherent narrative substance throughout the series.
[03:06:54] <lalia> I'm a much bigger fan of Philip K Dick however.
[03:07:34] <lalia> His writing style and thought experiments have proven to be a lot more exciting for me.
[03:07:35] <Parf> I really wish i had been exposed to more Dick as a youth. nowadays, i have little patience for Dick
[03:08:06] <lalia> Might depend on what you're reading. Martian Time Slip remains one of the best pieces of fiction I've ever heard of.
[03:08:47] <lalia> Especially if you're a fan of philosophical science fiction narratives.

[19:28:26] <lalia> That I enjoy it? Sure. That it's a great album? That's probably more a matter of respecting it for being a foundational and impactful entry in the development of industrial music. :)
[19:28:53] <lalia> If industrial music isn't your thing, I can imagine a lack of interest or being impressed.
[19:29:02] <lalia> Doesn't really make the album less great tho. :P
