[11:56:40] <trillian> and i have people i care about who don't want to get vaccinated i don't want to see them lose their jobs and not be able to buy food or whatever they need because they just really don't want the vaccine

[12:17:27] <DPA> I do think people should vaccinate themselfes, I got it. However, it's not bad when a few do not, in the off chance some unexpected side effects show up in some years after all.
[12:17:27] <DPA> But I do think the unvaccinated people clogging up the hospital is a problem. I think we shouldn't treat people who haven't tried to get the vaccine / at least made an an appointment. Tell them clearly, if you don't let us protect you, we'll let you die.

[13:15:01] <ldlework> total
[13:15:41] <blkshp> Evidence?
[13:16:31] <blkshp> Oh I was looking at total deaths, my mistake
[13:16:43] <blkshp> i see 20k
[13:17:16] <blkshp> From the CDC Website from 1/1 to 9/4 (which i presume under the stupid US dating system is the 4th sept)

[13:17:43] <ro-bot-o> [url] COVID-19 Provisional Counts - Weekly Updates by Select Demographic and Geographic Characteristics | www.cdc.gov
[13:17:44] <blkshp> And anyway, what's the point trying to be made?
[13:17:51] <ldlework> Well you thought it was 500k
[13:18:00] <ldlework> which is magnitudes off
[13:18:18] <ldlework> well off by a multiple then a magnitude
[13:18:20] <blkshp> As i explained i was looking at total deaths in error because the site has stupid condensed titles
[13:18:34] <ldlework> right but you were of a mind to believe 500k under 35 died from covid
[13:18:49] <blkshp> Well I'm not from the US and I have no idea of the totals.
[13:18:55] <brigand> 20k isn't nothing
[13:18:57] <blkshp> Still, not sure of the point
[13:19:40] <blkshp> What point were you trying to make in connection with the topic that was being discussed when you first asked the question?
[13:19:51] <ldlework> i think that's pretty clear given what i said about violating people's liberty
[13:19:53] <blkshp> Not enough people die to warrant people getting vaccinated?
[13:20:17] <ldlework> >> trillian: it feels like the difference between ethics and morality to me. defending the idea that we shouldn't violate people's liberty as an ethical statement, doesn't entail that we morally believe people shouldn't make the decision to get vaccinated

[13:20:26] <amigojapan> Any idea where I can learn why it seems that the sun starts as a tiny little sun and grows bigger at sunrise? What kind of effect is this? I am debating it against a flat earther who thinks the sun is coming from far away in the perspective and that is why it looks tiny
[13:20:52] <ldlework> the idea that it may not be worth violating people's liberty over doesn't entail a belief people shouldn't get vaccinated
[13:20:56] <ldlework> it's a non-sequitur
[13:21:24] <ldlework> amigojapan: it's the same reason why sunsets happen
[13:21:31] <amigojapan> blkshp: even few people are valuable
[13:21:36] <ldlework> the light has to travel through more atmopshere causing additional diffraction

[13:23:19] <amigojapan> Ah ok blkshp
