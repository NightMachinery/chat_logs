[01:49:11] <Somelauw> How to represent NA in julia?
[01:50:20] <Somelauw> unicode doesn't work: 3 × 5 doesn't work, 5² doesn't square
[01:51:07] <Somelauw> 4 + 5i doesn't complex
[01:51:14] <Somelauw> ah, im

[03:08:58] <dTal> another happy customer
[03:09:53] <dTal> Somelauw: the trouble with squaring is you can't superscript any exponent, just the ones they put in Unicode
[03:10:23] <dTal> and exponentiation is its own syntax, so you'd need a whole extension to the reader just to be able to support those couple of exponents
[03:11:39] <dTal> Julia source isn't meant to be LaTeX, "unicode support" just means you can use unicode anywhere
[03:12:16] <dTal> that said, you can do × = *
[03:12:20] <dTal> if you really want
[03:35:52] <Somelauw> (*)(3, 4)
[03:35:58] <Somelauw> gives 12 actualy, okay
[03:37:14] <Somelauw> printstyled("hello", bold=True)
[03:38:35] <Somelauw> Does julia have a good IDE?
[04:05:12] <mikko> Somelauw: if you mean "NA" like it is in R that's called "missing" in julia
[04:05:39] <mikko> as for IDE, the vs code extension is pretty good (it does way more than just syntax highlighting)
[04:07:13] <mikko> and i guess if you really want to use \times instead of * you can do × = (*)
[04:21:42] <Somelauw> mikko: that actually worked, but how did it know it was an infix?
[04:22:03] <Somelauw> and what parsing priority does it have over *
[04:22:25] <Somelauw> VS code is free?
[04:22:28] <mikko> not sure if this is documented anywhere other than this scheme file https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/src/julia-parser.scm
[04:23:28] <mikko> yes, vs code is free and if you want the de-microsofted version (no telemetry etc) forks exist too
[04:24:39] <Somelauw> thanks

[10:08:14] <ninjin> VS Code is tricky beast. Most of the underlying source code is free (as in freedom), but when they package up the binary they blend in some proprietary nonsense. Akin to Chrome vs Chromium I guess.

[10:09:03] <ninjin> I have used VSCodium to see how well it would work for my students, but I was pretty promptly back in Vim myself as I am just not an IDE person.
[10:09:45] <ninjin> mikko: Yes, I think you are right that the grammar is de-facto defined by the parser. As far as I know there has never been a formal definition of the Julia grammar.
[10:17:12] <mikko> i like parts of (neo)vim but it is such a pain to configure and find/install plugins compared to vscode... some stuff just works better with a gui
[10:19:18] <ninjin> Use whatever gets you to produce code. =) I am far too old for religious wars at this point. ;) Since I am on NixOS plugin management is all through the rather powerful package manager, but I sure remember how unfun it was to sync my Vim configs between boxes prior to Nix.
