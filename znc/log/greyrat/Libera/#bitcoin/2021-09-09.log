[01:25:23] <echelon> nope, my email was in the mtgox leaked db, i get emails from everywhere, but gmail filters them out pretty well
[01:25:24] <snake> i feel like they are luring people onto their site via email to register for the first time, like a dark-pattern of the web
[01:25:47] <echelon> so.. you don't know if you were on the site before?
[01:25:49] <snake> echelon, my email is in the git log of bitcoin core ;-;

[01:26:15] <snake> no i have defnitialy never been to a shoddy crypto trading site called goku
[01:26:26] <snake> i think
[01:27:00] <snake> echelon, but they could pretend to let you reset your password and actually register a new account from the change password form
[01:27:17] <echelon> right
[01:27:24] <snake> that's the dark-pattern
[01:27:36] <snake> i hate dark-patterns ;-; and random emails
[01:27:58] <echelon> let gmail filter your emails
[01:28:02] <snake> i do yeah
[01:28:16] <snake> sometimes one slips thru the cracks if it looks official
[01:28:17] <echelon> the spam filter on google voice is pretty lousy though
[01:29:19] <snake> i've even gotten emails from google to help "verify my identity" it was not really from google, but they almost wrote the perfect official looking email message, there was one thing wrong that gave it away... which i dont remember what it was
[01:29:43] <echelon> broken english
[01:29:46] <echelon> ?
[01:30:08] <snake> no the english was oddly on point, i think it may have been an english mistake tho, perhaps near the end of the message

[04:11:06] <IRC-Journalist> I'm revisiting IRC after 20 years.    I'm curious, is there much activity here?
[04:12:14] <IRC-Journalist> Or is this just a slow time of day?
[04:15:08] <as2334> oh interesting - the channel was a lot busier a few years ago
[04:16:22] <as2334> I think there's been a lot less activity on freenode-now-libera in the last few years (say 3-4 years)
[04:18:43] <IRC-Journalist> ah yeah
[04:18:57] <IRC-Journalist> Is libera the top network right now?
[04:19:37] <as2334> it could be - I haven't checked tho
[04:20:17] <IRC-Journalist> So this channel is for general QA about bitcoin?
[04:20:37] <as2334> yeah

[04:24:24] <IRC-Journalist> I saw a video of a bitcoin starbucks transaction, seemed awkward.
[04:25:25] <as2334> I guess government involvement would be ok if it meant they won't interfere with bitcoin use, and do nothing else.

[23:04:12] <shiza> I think you are taking tor exit servers as bitcoin nodes.
[23:04:19] <enemy> from 10,000 full nodes about 4,000 is in Germany and USA, I don't know how many are full nodes and pruned but would be interesting to see only the full nodes
[23:05:46] <enemy> NODE_NETWORK, NODE_WITNESS, NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED (1033) = Full node
[23:06:36] <enemy> NODE_WITNESS, NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED (1033) = Pruned node
[23:06:43] <shiza> I have my eye on a shitcoin and their country distribution is similar. But when it comes to network provider, it seems most US nodes are Digital Ocean nodes, which I suspect are tor exit servers.
[23:06:45] <enemy> if I don't mistake it
[23:07:30] <paulo> there's no 51% attack if it's the number of nodes
[23:07:50] <enemy> +1 evil miner
[23:08:06] <paulo> the 51% attack only comes from hashing rate
[23:08:39] <enemy> not just
[23:08:54] <enemy> you need full nodes to verify the block chain
[23:09:52] <enemy> one evil miner + 51% of the nodes is enough, you don't have to necessary obtain 51% of the hashing power
[23:10:16] <earnestly> There's no incentive to a 51% attack that wouldn't be more profitable to simply use the hash rate that would be capable of such a thing.  If such a thing happened it would be noticed (to be worth it) and invalidated
[23:10:33] <paulo> you only need to connect to 1 honest node to sync to the network
[23:10:52] <paulo> (it would be slower, but will sync eventually)
[23:12:05] <paulo>  nodes will still be able to find the honest chain (because it has the most proof of work) as long as it connects to 1 honest node
[23:12:49] <earnestly> bitcoin is not the only medium of communication either, such a thing as a 51% cannot just "happen" with consequences

[23:13:19] <earnestly> It's such small and irrelevant issue, the bigger risk is coin tainting

[23:15:42] <enemy> convincing node operators to push for an invalid chain is pretty difficult and you're right about that 51% attack is more profitable by obtaining 51% of the hashing power, however in that case still the nodes which verify it playing a significant role
[23:16:45] *** Joins: Alina-malina (~Alina-mal@user/alina-malina)
[23:17:16] <paulo> nodes only verify it for themselves. your own node will always find the honest chain

[23:18:06] <paulo> enemy: that's not gonna work. my node will reject invalid blocks/txns and chains with lower work
[23:19:22] <enemy> your node goes to other nodes to obtain the chain, in theory a large scale governmental attack would be pretty possible, but this is all just fantasy the network is pretty strong

[23:23:11] <paulo> this is fast with headers first syncing
[23:23:28] <enemy> I'm very interested in why the USA and Germany has the most nodes, is the internet and hosting so cheap or something? Latency seems bad in these countries.
[23:24:56] <AndyS2> It's super cheap to host in Germany. Check serverboerse.de, they offer bare metal servers with unlimited traffic (way beyond 200TB/month, which was their previous limit) for 28 euros / month
[23:25:08] <paulo> enemy: https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/53708/how-proof-of-work-detects-sybil-attack-in-bitcoin
[23:25:23] <AndyS2> it's mostly desktop hardware, but it runs fine and you got all the usual services
[23:26:37] <enemy> Yes, and the most nodes are behind tor so this is why syncing is slow.
[23:27:17] *** Joins: abraham (~abraham@143.244.185.86)
[23:29:11] <paulo> nodes can find the best chain by downloading the headers first, which are 80 bytes each. 80 bytes * 700k blocks = 55mb for all headers
[23:29:35] <paulo> so nodes can find the best chain very quickly before doing the actualy syncing.
