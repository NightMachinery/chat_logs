[17:36:38] <rigid> ahoy
[17:38:35] <rigid> Is there a way to "cut out" a plot and combine it with other plots in one multiplot? I'm trying to combine a heatmap of multiple temperature sensors in rooms with an image of a floorplan and i'm not sure how to start.
[17:39:40] <rigid> previously i would just floodfill the areas with their respective color value but now there are multiple sensors per room and I considered gnuplot might be the best tool for the job.
[17:41:12] <rigid> The main problem i see is concavely shaped rooms, where one part of a room would be covered by the plot next door (without further gfx processing).
[17:41:47] <rigid> If I can cut off portions of a plot, I could just place the plots shaped correctly and overlay with a transparent floorplan
