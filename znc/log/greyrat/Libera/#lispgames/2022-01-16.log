[00:00:30] <artchad> what's cl-tiled?
[00:00:31] <artchad> O . o
[00:01:34] * artchad looks into cl-tiled
[00:09:36] <jstoddard> parser for tiled tilemaps
[00:13:23] <jstoddard> I have my test map loading in cl-tiled in both CCL and SBCL now.
[00:15:14] <jstoddard> CCL was throwing a bad-slot-type error when cl-tiled tried to set the 'terrains' slot in a 'tiled-tileset-tile' instance to a new array of length four and nil for each value. I'm not sure that this isn't a bug in CCL rather than cl-tiled.
[00:16:21] <jstoddard> Either way, I have it working with a reader conditional that leaves the array length undefined in the type specifier for 'terrains' in CCL.
[00:22:03] <|3b|`> looks like a cl-tiled bug
[00:22:10] *** |3b|` is now known as |3b|
[00:22:32] <|3b|> that slot is specified to be a 4d array, not a 4-element 1d array
[00:22:48] <|3b|> sbcl just doesn't usually check that and ccl does
[00:23:10] <|3b|> ('that' being types specified for slots of clos instances)
[00:27:41] <|3b|> jstoddard: https://github.com/Zulu-Inuoe/cl-tiled/blob/master/src/data-types.lisp#L397 looks like it should be (4) instead of 4
[00:29:04] <|3b|> 4 without () specified rank 4, not length 4
[00:31:01] <jstoddard> Okay, good to know, thanks. I'm not that sophisticated to have noticed.
[00:33:53] <jstoddard> And yep, that fixes it so it works in both SBCL and CCL without needing my little hack of a conditional now. So thanks again, |3b|

[00:43:52] <aeth> oh, wow, something that breaks in CCL that works in SBCL that doesn't have to do with when DEFCONSTANT is evaluated (which is fixed by adding an EVAL-WHEN so it runs in CCL)
[00:49:01] <jstoddard> aeth: That sounds like something I had to tweak to get opticl working in CCL a couple of weeks ago...
[00:54:31] <jstoddard> Here is a forked cl-tiled repository with four commits fixing the three issues I encountered this morning: https://github.com/jstoddard/cl-tiled/commits/master
[00:56:56] <jstoddard> I submitted a pull request for the first. The second involves adding a package qualifier to a slot name; I'm not sure whether the author of cl-tiled would rather just export the slot name. The others are for the CCL issue.
