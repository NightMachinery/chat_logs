[15:12:38] <sobel> i ended up reasonably unhappy with editor-integrated REPL access. that's the "best of both worlds" approach to me.
[15:14:32] *** Joins: libertyprime (~libertypr@124.197.60.232)
[15:15:02] <sobel> i liked sublimetext but vscode just has more gravity. that said, i'm srsly considering CIDER/emacs or Conjure, maybe Fireplace
[15:18:52] <sobel> back on the web perf thread, i just remembered my performance targets of ~300 reqs/sec on 400MHz Xeon hardware. apache/tomcat/mysql. some janky connection pooler called Poolman, and source-hacked mod_jk2 to load balance the tomcats. we were sure proud of delivering a fast "AJAX" based app in 2002.
[15:23:32] <andreyorst> sobel: CIDER is great, and if you know Vim keybindings you could try DOOM Emacs, AFAIC it has Clojure support preconfigured
[15:23:54] <andreyorst> although I would strongly recommend configuring vanila Emacs yourself instead of using things like DOOM or Spacemacs, given that we're familiar with lisps, but it's not for everyone

[15:40:03] <dpettersson> Cool. Can recommend emacs + evil + cider as a long time vim user. 
[15:43:08] <EdwardIII> i'm kind of partly tempted to try emacs but also scared it'll suck me into another world where a lambda in the sky imparts me with beautiful, forbidden knowledge and i can never again be happy in other environments
[15:48:49] <dpettersson> That's definitely could be a risk but the same argument could be made for the vi keybindings and evil is pretty good. So why take the next step and become more entrenched in your computer usage.
[15:54:13] <andreyorst> EdwardIII: eventually you'll find that that's a good thing :)
[15:54:57] <EdwardIII> :) 
[15:55:04] <EdwardIII> there is something magical about emacs

[16:35:04] <sobel> EdwardIII: contemplating why i didn't start with Quarkus, as well as why i didn't stick with http-kit. all the usual VertX use cases, i suppose.
[16:35:20] <EdwardIII> ah ha cool so just a kind of general web api backend type thing
[16:36:00] <EdwardIII> do you use the vertx sql client?
[16:36:41] <sobel> i'm using jdbc

[16:37:32] <sobel> i've seen the benchmarks, their rx postgresql client is faster for some use cases but they're extreme and the benefit is marginal. also i dream of having a good problem like db client performance. my userbase is very small.
[16:38:08] <sobel> realistically, complexity is the biggest reason i can't host the whole show on a t2.nano
[16:38:51] <EdwardIII> :D i have a feeling you might struggle to fit the jvm + the os in 512M of RAM
[16:39:09] <EdwardIII> what is complexity in this case? db, message queue, etc?
[16:40:18] <sobel> database, this vertx app, a few cron jobs that want to use a lot of RAM briefly, a reverse proxy (nginx), and a keycloak server
[16:41:17] <EdwardIII> what do you run the cron jobs on? fargate/ec run-task?
[16:41:18] <sobel> kc might be the only item that would be hard to cram into that footprint, and i think security for that nad the border proxy pretty much trump any need to cram everything in tightly
[16:41:49] <ridcully> dpettersson: asking here is fine - beginners and all the rest where not setup, because they where basically dead
[16:42:03] <sobel> EdwardIII: heh, nooooo i run the cron jobs locally
[16:42:23] <EdwardIII> sobel: you run them locally but they connect to the production db?
[16:42:25] <sobel> EdwardIII: but yes, fargate or lambda is the next step
[16:42:38] <sobel> EdwardIII: "locally" in this case meaning same host as the vertx service
[16:42:45] <EdwardIII> ah ha right i see
[16:42:53] <dpettersson> ridcully: Ah I see thanks!
[16:43:08] <EdwardIII> do you use containers already or just run your vertx service/cron directly on an ec2 Amazon Linux instance? 
[16:43:13] <EdwardIII> also i hope you don't mind all the questions :)
[16:43:44] <sobel> EdwardIII: nah, hosting/deployment is the iceberg under every app :) i'm running everything directly on EC2s
[16:43:48] <sobel> EC2 instances
[16:43:53] <EdwardIII> there's something to be said for that
[16:43:59] <EdwardIII> more complexity = more problems
[16:44:25] <EdwardIII> (we use containers in production and on dev machines, i have some real-world pain with this)
[16:44:45] <sobel> i used to run my border proxy in docker but it mysteriously died a deathy death on friday, so now it's running as an ordinary process
[16:45:38] <sobel> i have archiva and jenkins in containers, mainly because i could get those "off the shelf" but i'm about to write a jenkins build i can run on fargate
[16:46:01] <sobel> (or lambda, i'm not very familiar with the diffs)
[16:46:05] <EdwardIII> we just use buildspec.yml + do all the work in docker
[16:46:29] <EdwardIII> (well we also use CodePipeline, defined in cloudformation templates)
