[02:36:13] <Thete> It's no biggie I was just wondering if maybe I was doing something wrong since I thought for some reason ubuntu got its packages from debian 
[02:36:26] <ratrace> it does, but only some

[13:06:27] <antto> anyone uses hugo for static website? do i understand correctly that i install this on my local machine, and not on the actual server machine where my website is gonna be?
[13:06:27] <ratrace> or just    journalctl -u <tab>     to see which units are available for filtering
[13:07:22] <ratrace> antto: if hugo is anything like pelican, then it's just a tool you use to create html (and helper) files that you have to manually upload to your website docroot
[13:07:43] <antto> ,i hugo
[13:07:46] <judd> Package hugo (web, optional) in buster/amd64: Fast and flexible Static Site Generator written in Go. Version: 0.55.6+really0.54.0-1; Size: 5586.4k; Installed: 21442k; Homepage: https://gohugo.io/
[13:08:08] <antto> so then, "yes" ?
[13:08:15] <dob1> ratrace, the problem is that it's not an unit from what I see
[13:08:27] <dob1> in the logs there is just the loading of the kernel module
[13:08:49] <ratrace> antto: I suppose, given what "static website generators" do. they "just" convert your templates, source files, settings,   into a static website
[13:09:29] <ratrace> dob1: probably, I don't know of a virtualbox service. otherwise you can filter by facility or just grep it

[18:10:02] <hassoon> i bought this lenovo thinkbook 14 G2 ITL, and it seems like ubuntu works out of the box for it, found it certified for the machine in the lenovo website
[18:10:14] <hassoon> debian could not detect many components, it sucks :/
[18:10:25] <hassoon> otherwise i just use debian
[18:10:49] <hassoon> i'll keep ubuntu for a while until debian releases a newer version that works out of the box for this achine
[18:11:06] <PMT> that sounds like ubuntu might be bundling nonfree firmware by default to get that functionality, at a guess
[18:11:14] <ratrace> good guess 
[18:11:31] <nvs> or ThinkBook 14 could be so new
[18:11:46] <sney> ubuntu is also willing to use out-of-tree network drivers, debian won't do that until they hit mainline. but it's more likely just firmware and new hardware. try the bullseye installer. 
[18:12:06] <nvs> non-free installer
[18:12:09] <hassoon> PMT: yep, i installed the 5.9 kernel from debian backports, then had to look up installing iwlwifi and netwoking stuff, as well as audio and others
[18:12:23] <hassoon> PMT: couldn't figure it out, so i just switched back to ubuntu :|
[18:12:30] <PMT> I'm surprised you didn't start with the firmware then update the kernel if it didn't help

[18:12:33] <ratrace> there's also DKMS for out of tree drivers

[18:14:20] <hassoon> so i used that to update and install everything i could install, but meh, got bored in the end
[18:14:27] <kirk781> I tried installing Debian the other day and it won't go into a GUI with proper free drivers only. The available solutions all listed required an active network connection which I can't until it boots into the default Xfce environment
[18:14:28] <NthDegree> That includes a bunch of non-free firmware and it's bullseye

[18:18:06] <sney> john_rambo: it's on dvd 2 or 3, the packages are sorted by popularity and mate does not have a high popcon score. you could still select mate in the installer, and the installer would download it for you
[18:18:14] <hassoon> debian has been my main computing system, even though this ubuntu feels close to it, i'd stick with debian
[18:19:27] <hassoon> NthDegree: alright thanks, i'll try it in dual boot first, if everything is fine, i'll switch to it

[18:55:55] <amacater> Based on this tmux tutorial - https://ostechnix.com/autostart-tmux-session-on-remote-system-when-logging-in-via-ssh/ - no connection to this site, but you might have different profiles in different places ?
[19:00:27] <ratrace> that's not really related to tmux at all, but to starting new shells. shells source their rc files in order (and depending on login and interactive shells), so the question is only where you define the aliases
[19:01:11] <ratrace> by default on debian, with bash, ~/.bashrc is the place to define them and .bashrc is also sourced in .profile for login shells

Release day we're working to currently - as discussed in various mailing lists is July 31st 2021. There's a hard freeze from July 17th with only the most urgent security fixes after that date. Stuff may slip but July 31 is hoped for.

[22:05:22] <shtrb> PMT ,for me I had seed that your error-log is getting errors (one error for each cold boot), but when you try to read it says "The transport type is not indicated or the error is not transport related"
[22:05:53] <PMT> The drive's error log, I presume you mean?
[22:06:00] <shtrb> firmware error-log
[22:06:04] <sney> dual boot users often find out the hard way that they need to disable windows's fast boot voodoo, because it breaks multiple things in both OSes

[22:08:40] <PMT> ...I don't follow how that's related?
[22:09:08] <PMT> Is it that your old laptop lacks nvme?
[22:09:32] <shtrb> PMT, because at first I thought that's a hardware problem , now I know it's a software problem that 5.10  trigger somehow that may or may not harm the nvme firmware

[22:12:01] <PMT> And if it would damage the FW, just...stick with oldstable until it's resolved?
[22:13:19] <shtrb> The fear from damaging the firmware is based on the thuderbolt fiasco some time ago, that after a fixed number of errors you had to use special hardware to "flush" to fix the chip 
[22:13:32] *** Joins: catman (~catman@user/catman370)

[22:21:37] <PMT> Oof.
[22:22:09] <PMT> I may have missed that because I almost never tell my BIOS anything about what I'm planning to run, either back when BIOSes advertised Windows/DOS/... support or now.
[22:22:56] <shtrb> Thunderbolt was not loading in linux with that option (I don't even understand how it would be "unlocked" with windows)
[22:23:41] <shtrb> "Linux certificated workstations"
[22:24:55] <PMT> I find it hard to hold it against Lenovo for problems involving Thunderbolt, since that's been such an underdeployed tech for a long while, and it's not like other companies selling Linux computers haven't had stupid problems.
[22:26:41] <NthDegree> Thunderbolt is crap on Windows too
[22:26:55] <PMT> OSes are still really bad at hotplug PCIe.
[22:27:06] <PMT> They used to be much worse, but they're still not great at it.
[22:27:29] <NthDegree> Most of the issue is down to Intel's reference drivers though

[22:57:09] <PMT> shtrb: https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd/issues/3186 seems to imply they think it might be a problem with fwupd, not the firmware updates themselves?
[22:57:24] *** Joins: ice9 (~ice9@user/ice9)
[22:57:39] <shtrb> I had seen reports it's Lenovo's blame 
[22:58:03] <PMT> Not impossible, just sharing what I found when trying to look after the link to lvfs's bugs 404ed from that Debian bug.
[22:58:29] *** Joins: mixfix41 (~homefame@user/mixfix41)
[22:58:42] <Fjorgynn> it's a unix system, I know this
[22:59:26] <PMT> This is not #irix ;)

[23:11:46] <jhutchins> How did we get to irixx?
[23:12:06] <PMT> Now I feel old.
[23:12:35] <PMT> The quote Fjorgynn said is from Jurassic Park, in which the speaking character is staring at a distinctive IRIX file browser.
[23:12:38] <PMT> (IIRC)
[23:13:15] <hassoon> what's irix

[23:13:46] <PMT> It was a UNIX derivative. It is no longer maintained.
[23:13:48] <jhutchins> !irix
[23:13:48] <dpkg> it has been said that irix is SGI's Unix operating system, or referred to as 'the masochist os' (though newer versions do improve on it).  It is known for security problems, like having suid CGI scripts (i kid you not.), or has DEFAULT PASSWORDLESS LOGINS in older versions.
[23:13:54] <hassoon> a ok
[23:13:57] <shtrb> PMT, If you know what a 5¼"  is you are not that old
[23:14:57] <PMT> shtrb: I'm not sure that statement follows. Maybe a negative, like "if you have never used an MFM hard drive" might work.

[23:15:53] <sney> if you never had to manually run AT commands on a modem to connect to the internet, etc. of course a lot of that stuff was still around in edge cases well into the mid 00s 
[23:16:05] <Fjorgynn> :)

[23:16:48] <shtrb> sney, wvdial still uses AT commands and you write it down to connect to the internet or the the MMS gateway 
[23:17:10] <shtrb> just a different set of commands , and different hardware
[23:17:23] *** Joins: cliluw (~cliluw@47.147.80.149)
[23:17:44] <sney> yeah PPP hasn't gone anywhere. I was thinking of 56k and earlier though. 
[23:17:53] <shtrb> Wasn't it 30 years ago was 1970 no ? no ?!
[23:18:23] <jhutchins> I've used 8" floppies on two different systems.
[23:18:25] <PMT> Womp womp.
[23:18:43] <shtrb> sney, oh good old USRs 
[23:18:48] <PMT> I think I have never used 8 inch floppies, to my recollection. I used CDs in cartridges, that was fun.
[23:19:47] <shtrb> I still remember when we had to flip the floppy drives to read the program from the other side of the floppy 
[23:19:55] <PMT> Yuuuuup.
[23:19:56] <shtrb> 180K become 360K !
[23:21:37] <jhutchins> I have a 18" 1MB removable hard disk platter in it's special storage case.
[23:22:14] <shtrb> :D

[23:22:52] <PMT> I disposed of a lot of my older gear when I moved a few years ago, as I was moving to a much smaller apartment.

[23:34:34] <jhutchins> I've got two shelving units in the basement, 20' of shelving in my office, and a banker's box half full of floppies.  Oh, and the 24" cubic box on the office floor that's miscelaneouns electronics.
[23:35:11] <jhutchins> I need to get back to taking the more overt computer gear to Best Buy.  I don't know if they take dead DustBusters.
[23:35:38] <jhutchins> There's a place in town that was taking floppies for recycling, but they closed with the pandemic.
