[06:09:21] <drakonis> japhb: code completion works as expected, yeah?
[06:09:40] <drakonis> i tried emacs and found it odd that completion didn't really work all that well
[06:20:24] <japhb> drakonis: What kind of "code completion" are you talking about?  Being able to tab-complete partial method/class/constant names, that sort of thing?
[06:20:33] <drakonis> yeah, that's the one.
[06:21:00] <japhb> Ah, in that case you're probably looking more for what's in Comma than in Emacs raku-mode
[06:21:43] <drakonis> ah i see.
[06:21:47] <japhb> raku-mode is more about highlighting, code layout defaults, correct region commenting, that sort of thing
[06:21:49] <drakonis> i already have comma installed, but fair enough.
[06:22:11] <drakonis> its still ways from being competitive with other major modes in emacs
[06:22:13] <japhb> A recent version, I hope?  Comma does regular releases.
[06:22:20] <drakonis> its as recent as yesterday
[06:23:11] <japhb> drakonis: Not terribly surprised; several of the folks who are really good at writing editor plugins work on Comma.
[06:23:28] <japhb> (And thus not on Emacs, I mean.)
[06:23:52] <drakonis> bummer
[06:24:11] <japhb> Opportunity for you?  ;-)
[06:24:16] <drakonis> ha, perhaps.
[06:24:42] <drakonis> i'm not particularly great at elisp anyways
[06:24:52] <japhb> I resemble that remark
[06:25:21] <perryprog> Tangentially related, but I remember a person at a place I had a paid internship I had who wrote production applications in elisp
[06:25:25] <perryprog> They loooved it
[06:25:33] <drakonis> lol, elisp or common lisp?
[06:25:36] <perryprog> Elisp!
[06:25:46] <drakonis> ha, that's impressive
[06:26:01] <perryprog> For sure. Had a pretty sick emacs setup, too.
[06:26:05] <perryprog> (Duh)
[06:26:12] <drakonis> haw, you gotta have that.
[06:26:29] <perryprog> Admittedly emacs's first class support for elisp is pretty nice
[06:26:39] <japhb> I bet.  If you're going to invest all that time in learning one particular lisp variant, you'll tend to get into customizing
[06:26:44] <drakonis> i'm coming off common lisp to check out raku
[06:27:00] <drakonis> i dearly miss the editing experience i suppose
[06:27:05] <perryprog> I've gotta finish learning sbcl
[06:27:17] <perryprog> My favorite language has always been Clojure, though :)
[06:28:43] <drakonis> i'm ambivalent towards clojure
[06:29:11] <perryprog> It helps if you're coming from JVM land, like I was
[06:29:24] <drakonis> that's true, yeah.
[06:29:24] <perryprog> Having access to that giant toolbox helps a ton in understanding the power Clojure gives
[06:29:37] <drakonis> clojure's popularity is largely due to that
[06:29:44] <perryprog> Definitely 
[06:30:01] <perryprog> Somewhat decent interoperability from functional to OO isn't easy to pull off
[06:30:11] <perryprog> (Not amazing, mind you, but there's only so much you can do ;) )
[06:30:52] <drakonis> sure thing.
[06:32:20] <drakonis> raku looks very nice though
[06:32:53] <drakonis> i've heard about it back when it was still perl 6 but never actually bothered looking too deep into it
[06:33:27] <drakonis> today i looked up the docs and actually got curious about it
[06:33:57] <drakonis> seems like a lot of fun to play with

[21:58:43] <kiti_nomad[m]> 草泥马，别搞政治正确
[21:59:23] <kiti_nomad[m]> Don't follow the trend of politics
[22:02:42] <[Coke]> google translate says that included the phrase "political correctness", which in the US, is a weird right-wing way to say "treat other people with respect".
[22:03:49] <[Coke]> but that's probably just a bad translation.
[22:05:19] <kiti_nomad[m]> If you do not support Ukraine, will your computer not be able to work? Does politics affect programming? What kind of life did the people of Ukraine live before Russia and Ukraine went to war? Do you understand? No one really cares about life in Ukraine, so why write about those junk things?
[22:07:04] <lizmat> "No one really cares about life in Ukraine"
[22:07:33] <lizmat> Actually I do, good friends of mine lived in the Ukraine and had to flee
[22:08:34] <lizmat> apart from that: Russia's government and clergy want me dead, literally!
[22:08:39] <lizmat> so yes, I *do* care
[22:10:44] <lizmat> and that's why I write about them in the Rakudo Weekly
[22:13:58] <[Coke]> oh, and having googled a bit more about the chinese there, I see the apparently nonsensical intro is probably a standin for a rude phrase.
[22:14:43] <kiti_nomad[m]> So why don't you support North Koreans, Cubans, Libyans, Syrians, Yugoslavs, and Afghanistan?
[22:16:33] <lizmat> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_Mud_Horse#Etymology_and_species
[22:16:58] <lizmat> so why don't you start with a more friendly intro?
[22:21:27] <kiti_nomad[m]> A dog bit a beggar. No one cares about the life of that beggar unless someone is on the scene, because this is an opportunity to make a show. But they just pretended to intimidate the dog, and no one would really fight with the dog. Now those people say that beggars are pitiful when they see people

[22:27:39] *** ChanServ sets mode: +o lizmat
[22:29:16] <BinGOs> [Coke]: all the cool fascists say "woke" and "cancel culture" these days.
[22:33:15] <[Coke]> BinGOs: fair, PC is an earlier variant.
[22:33:54] <kiti_nomad[m]> As far as I know, I think Ukraine is eager to be invaded by Russia. Because you can join the European Union or NATO in this way. Then you don't have to do anything, just stretch out your hands like those beggars, and you can be happy.
