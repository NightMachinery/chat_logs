[03:37:38] <muaddib[m]> I finally found the coax run for the satellite dish on my roof (and I don‚Äôt have DirectTV). Is there anything fun or interesting that can be done with that dish? I was thinking I‚Äôd like to repurpose it as a generic antenna, but don‚Äôt really know what for other than ‚Äúspace-ish‚Äù stuff.
[03:46:00] <jholtom> I'm pretty sure they are Ku ish tuned
[03:46:08] <jholtom> And have some built in down conversion stuff
[03:46:22] <jholtom> Or maybe Ka? It's been a while
[03:47:49] <jholtom> I'm sure there's some near earth radio astronomy to be done or messed with.  Maybe some LEO sats to listen to.  It would need to be re-aimed for sure since now it's aimed straight at the DirecTV zone
[03:53:31] <funkylab[m]> the downconversion is done in the LNB, so yeah, what's mounted in the focal point needs to be replaced unless you want to do sat TV frequencies
[03:53:51] *** Joins: sdfgsdfg (~sdfgsdfg@user/sdfgsdfg)
[03:54:11] <funkylab[m]> of course, lower freq -> lower gain for the same dish size, but you could maybe still use something like 4G / 5G signals for passive radar purposes :)

[04:32:21] <patchvonbraun[m]> It'll be Ku-band almost for sure.  Designed for 11.7 - 12.2 GHz, with an LO of perhaps 10.7 or 10.6 GHz, giving you an output band in L-band.  The details depend on the particular LNB you have.
[04:32:43] <patchvonbraun[m]> And what mode it's in when there's no receiver telling it what to do.  It gets DC power up the coax.
[04:37:14] <patchvonbraun[m]> Starlink can use frequencies between 10.7 and 12.7GHz, and there's a crap-tonne of those sats now.

[04:47:09] <muaddib[m]> Wow thanks!
[04:47:14] <muaddib[m]> To everyone
[04:48:30] <muaddib[m]> funkylab: the passive radar thing sounds like a fun idea
[04:51:10] <muaddib[m]> patchvonbraun: I‚Äôll check the unit to see what the LNB is. It has 2 ‚Äònodes‚Äô or whatever they‚Äôre called. Does a ‚Äòdual LNB‚Äô have 2 physical objects at the receive point? I remember that term from a while back.
[04:52:11] <muaddib[m]> So it will need bias power up the line then. I‚Äôll see what it takes vs what I have ‚Äòin stock‚Äô.
[04:52:15] <patchvonbraun[m]> muaddib: It depends.  Some single-feed LNBFs just have two outputs.  Some have two outputs with different polarizations.  Some have two outputs with different bands.
[04:52:25] <patchvonbraun[m]> muaddib: 13-18V usually
[04:52:57] <patchvonbraun[m]> Some LNBFs have two distinct feeds in them, and they're arranged to "look" at two different satellites.

[05:00:19] <muaddib[m]> Oh ok. Do the receiver choose between the distinct feeds or do they have a constructive effect?
[05:05:36] <patchvonbraun[m]> It depends on the receiver.

[05:18:26] <patchvonbraun[m]> LNBF parameters are often chosen using a combination of 22kHz tone, and the supply voltage.  Usually supply voltage selects H/V and 22kHz selects "high/low" downconversion range.
[05:22:06] *** Quits: sdfgsdfg (~sdfgsdfg@user/sdfgsdfg) (Quit: ZzzZ)
[05:22:22] <patchvonbraun[m]> But for multi-feed, its gets more exotic.
[05:30:46] <patchvonbraun[m]> Usually DBS sat service providers would sell you an entire, pre-integrated "system" including the dish, LNBF, possibly RF switchgear, and the receiver.  So the details would very often differ from provider to provider and based on what "package" you bought from the provider.

[05:46:01] <patchvonbraun[m]> I mean, squirt 13V up the cable, and look in the range 950-2150Mhz, and you'll find carriers likely.  But you won't know whether you're looking at high-band or low-band or H or V, etc, etc.

[05:55:24] <muaddib[m]> Gotcha. So i assume that theoretically, if I had a Ku band satellite sitting in my backyard and had a mouse and keyboard plugged in to configure it, I could figure out the polarization and bands of my LNB right?

[05:56:34] <patchvonbraun[m]> Yeah, or you could just determine the make/model of the LNBF, and look up the data for it :)
[05:57:19] <muaddib[m]> Ah, I assumed that was closed info.
[05:57:27] <muaddib[m]> For the record I don‚Äôt have a ku band satellite sitting in my backyard.
[05:57:57] <patchvonbraun[m]> Like I said, for casual "is this thing working", you insert a bias-T and squirt 12-18V towards the LNBF, and see what you see in the 950Mhz to 2150Mhz range coming out of it.  The LNBFs typicaly have lots of gain (50-60dB is typical).
[05:58:28] <muaddib[m]> Aha. Now it makes sense.

[20:37:17] <marvinXP> I have a NRZ FSK signal I'm decoding, where stay of frequency is a one, and flip to the other frequency is a zero (or the other way around, doesn't matter). I'm using Correlation Estimator to help the Symbol Sync block. But the Correlation Estimator forces me to choose which frequency I expect the transmission will start on. Is there a way to get it to "check for these symbols, or the opposite"?

[20:57:58] <Yamakaja[m]> Hi
[20:58:08] <Foxyfox> Hi
[20:58:31] <Guest63> I haven't been on IRC for ages. I was suprised there was a server for GNURadio
[20:59:08] <Yamakaja> In IRC terminology that's a channel :P
[20:59:29] <Guest63> Good point haha :P
[20:59:35] <Foxyfox> marvinXP holy cow that's complicated to me
[21:00:38] <Guest63> Is this good place to ask for help regarding gnuradio?
[21:00:56] <Yamakaja[m]> Exactly the right place :)
[21:00:57] <Guest63> or is this mostly used for other things?

[21:02:00] <Guest63> Cool. I'm quite new to this scene, have been trying to experiment with gnu radio companion for some days. Are there any good resources you guys would recommend?
[21:02:33] <Yamakaja[m]> Take a look at the wiki https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/Tutorials

[21:09:22] <drmpeg> jmfriedt[m] I know where that string comes from.
[21:10:11] <drmpeg> It's in a pybind11 CMake file.
[21:11:09] <jmfriedt[m]> I thought so from the pybind11 github issue but cannot find the location of the faulty architecture identification
[21:11:55] <drmpeg> It starts in gnuradio/cmake/Modules/GrPybind.cmake
[21:12:25] <drmpeg> A special function is used to create the library.
[21:12:40] <drmpeg> pybind11_add_module
[21:13:53] <drmpeg> That's in (on my Ubuntu system) /usr/lib/cmake/pybind11/pybind11Tools.cmake

[21:14:40] <drmpeg> In that file, there's a line:
[21:14:49] <drmpeg> set_target_properties(${target_name} PROPERTIES SUFFIX "${PYTHON_MODULE_EXTENSION}")
[21:15:25] <drmpeg> PYTHON_MODULE_EXTENSION is .cpython-38-x86_64-linux-gnu.so

[21:19:40] <drmpeg> Where's that?
[21:20:26] <Yamakaja[m]> https://github.com/pybind/pybind11/blob/master/tools/FindPythonLibsNew.cmake#L120
[21:20:41] <Yamakaja[m]> Actually, checking SO is deprecated now
[21:21:01] <Yamakaja[m]> So technically it's `python -c "from distutils import sysconfig as s; print(s.get_config_var('EXT_SUFFIX'));"`

[21:26:40] <drmpeg> I guess you could try forcing the suffix in GrPybind.cmake.
[21:27:10] <drmpeg> Lemme try it.
[21:27:27] <Yamakaja[m]> And maybe open an issue with the pybind guys about this
[21:27:56] <Crofton[m]> What do we want the suffix to be?
[21:28:12] <Yamakaja[m]> Well, it needs to respect cross compiling somehow
[21:29:09] <Crofton[m]> why do we need to know about the build machine in the lib name? I guess that is my question? Or even machine it shoudl run on
[21:29:34] <Yamakaja[m]> Because that's how cpython works i guess ü§î
