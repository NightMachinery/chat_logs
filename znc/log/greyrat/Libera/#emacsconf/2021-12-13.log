[08:36:03] <rdrg109> [Q] I know EmacsConf has already finished and probably most of the proceedings, but would it be possible to get the recordings in Wikimedia Commons? Some of the benefits would be (1) People can contribute by adding subtitles in 444 languages (2) An account is NOT required to contribute (3) There exists log of changes (i.e. if someone tries to vandalize the subtitles, their changes can be
[08:36:04] <rdrg109> reverted)

[11:37:01] <zaeph> rdrg109: Hi.  I don't see any immediate problems with uploading the talks to Wikimedia Commons besides asking speakers for their permission; however, your three points are already covered in our current workflow.  We are also working on better facilities for creating subtitles, and we could add “making it easier to add subtitles in different languages” to our list of design goals.
[11:37:51] <zaeph> We'll have a look at Wikimedia's tooling for crowdsourcing subtitling efforts; thanks for your insight!
[11:38:34] <zaeph> And, if you're making this suggestion because you or someone you know are feeling impeded by our current process, please let us know, and we'll walk you or them through the process. :)

[20:16:07] <sachac> speakers don't need to give explicit permission, we have it covered under the release, I think

[20:16:47] <zaeph> sachac: I thought so too, but I had a little bit of doubt in my head as well.

[20:17:53] <sachac> rdrg109: do you want to take charge of uploading?
[20:18:57] <sachac> not sure if it meets the "Will it be useful to a Wikimedia Foundation project" point
[20:19:15] <sachac> also, the omegat talk has subtitles in French and Japanese too! :)
[20:19:39] <zaeph> …Especially if we're already handling the distribution of those resources with FLOSS.
[20:19:43] <sachac> or it did on the webplayer before I fiddled too much with it
[20:19:51] <sachac> I will fix it later
[20:23:19] <zaeph> sachac: Fixing it now; don't worry about it.
[20:23:35] <zaeph> Ah, actually, yes, you might need to worry about it, since it's auto-generated.

[21:56:12] <bandali> yes we should be good license-wise. might be a good idea to have 'official' emacsconf accounts for archive.org and/or wikimedia for the uploads
[22:06:37] <rdrg109> sachac: I can help with that or whatever is needed regarding that. I've created a thread in the Village Pump of Wikimedia Commons with some of the questions mentioned here: https://w.wiki/4YYW
[22:07:44] <zaeph> rdrg109: I believe sachac was only mentioning archive.org as another avenue, and shouldn't have an impact on what we would do with Wikimedia.
[22:09:27] <zaeph> I also feel like the “more beneficial” is implying that Wikimedia would be a better avenue of publishing than what we currently do, and I think we'd rather think of them as different (i.e. without imprinting a hierarchy).
[22:11:33] <zaeph> I know that you're basing that comment based on the subtitling ease, but we're currently working with subed.el to make those edits from Emacs.  It'd be great if we could figure out a workflow to combine efforts here.
[22:17:44] <rdrg109> zaeph: Yes, that would be ideal. I think that both alternatives can coexist (i.e. videos are hosted in Emacsconf.org and (Commons or archive.org)) so that there are more options for people
[22:18:44] <zaeph> We're always up for more options, especially when people are volunteering to handle the admin around and for it.
[22:18:56] <rdrg109> zaeph: I can take charge of uploading them to Commons and updating their metadata
[22:19:23] <zaeph> Awesome!  Then, do let us know how it's going or if you need help.
[22:24:03] <rdrg109> zaeph: I want to make sure that we are "license-wise". Could anyone double check this? I have basic knowledge on licenses and want to make sure that the uploads in Commons are not affected by this
[22:25:35] <zaeph> rdrg109: As long as it's Wikimedia accepts the requests, we'll make adjustments to the license if they're required, and we'll renew permission from the speakers.  Don't worry about this.
[22:26:03] <zaeph> Worst case scenario, we can have a subset of the talks hosted there.
[22:27:47] <rdrg109> zaeph: Ok! Thanks!
[22:28:01] <rdrg109> bandali: You mentioned about official emacsconf accounts for Wikimedia Commons. Shall I create one?
