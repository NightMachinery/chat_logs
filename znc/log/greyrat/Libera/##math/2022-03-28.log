[00:35:50] <river> and integrate this?
[00:36:24] <Pollion> you don't need integration
[00:36:25] <river> f(x) = i x^(i-1) / 2^i actually, f(x) = d/dx g(x) where g(x) = x^i / 2^i

[02:57:28] <junebug> So sorry. Not sure why my internet keeps disconnecting
[02:57:36] <ihate> the point is that the language you are using is not precise enough. 1/x does not have a limit as x->0. You can say, however, that 1/x can be made to go to -oo or +oo. To say it approaches both is incorrect.
[02:57:54] <ihate> it doesn't approach anything as x->0
[02:57:59] <ihate> (you didn't miss anything)
[02:58:36] <junebug> Ok. So if I want to say x/y (some words) both infinity and 0 how can I phrase that?
[02:58:42] <ihate> x/y doesn't approach anything ax (x,y)->(0,0). Howeover, by taking special paths for (x,y) I can make it approach anything I want

[06:37:26] <ihate> Question: does the adjoint representation of a Lie group just equal the identity map on the center of the Lie algebra?
[06:37:53] <ihate> Does this work: Let G be Lie group with Lie algebra g and let Z(G), z(g) be their centers. Let P_g(h) = ghg^-1. Since Z in z(g) implies exp(tZ) in Z(G), we have P_g(exp(tZ)) = exp(tZ). Differentiating at t=0 then gives Ad_g(Z) = Z, i.e., Ad_g on z(g) is just the identity map?

[06:55:37] <ihate> why not the trinomial theorem?
[06:56:41] <DoYouKnow> well, the identity of matrices is special because you can find commutative identity matrices but not all identity matrices multiply out to be commutative
[06:57:01] <ihate> can you use a symplectic form
[06:57:19] <DoYouKnow> possibly, yes
[06:58:49] <isekaijin> ihate: There's no need to humor DoYouKnow. Either it's a bot, or it's someone acting in bad faith.
[06:59:00] <DoYouKnow> if you use the indices notation for the matrices, you can use the einstein summation convention, and factorize them by finding the eigenvalue. I think they mentioned this in Sean Carroll's notes on GR

[08:52:39] <DoYouKno> "This holds for arbitrary elliptic differential operators with smooth coefficients or arbitrary elliptic pseudo-differential operators (with smooth symbols). It is also true for elliptic operators of a boundary value problem (that is, it is true up to the boundary when the Shapiro–Lopatinskii condition holds). A sharper form of this property is a micro-local version of it: If A is an elliptic operator at a point (x0,ξ0) (whe

Another improvement: If A is an elliptic operator of order m and f∈Wsp, then u∈Ws+pm, where Wsp is the Sobolev space, 1<p<∞. If A is an elliptic differential operator with analytic coefficients and if f is analytic, then so is u. (In the case of equations with constant co

[12:48:58] <greenbagels> i suppose brown

[12:49:07] <greenbagels> depending on how you look at colors
[12:51:14] <twJizhan> 1st reault of google "mix green red" says yellow
[12:53:04] <twJizhan> wait... can "mixing colors" be some kind of commutative group? @.@

[17:32:44] <PlanckWalk> Then yeah, you can do much better than all pairs shortest paths :)
[17:33:03] <PlanckWalk> Also, weighted edges or just weight 1 everywhere?
[17:33:19] <joel135> so that for instance if there is a missing data problem in statistics, and the vertices A have missing data, then they can be given values from those for B
[17:33:52] <joel135> it doesn't really matter if it only works for weight 1

[17:35:22] <joel135> i guess the reasonable thing to do is to keep a queue initialized to B and then just traverse the whole graph once to fill up A
[17:35:27] <PlanckWalk> Weight 1 is really easy.  Just breadth-first all the vertices in A until you hit vertices in B.
[17:35:31] <joel135> exactly

But why doesn't it contain a d^2u_x/dz^2 term? Surely it should because it appears as though ux does vary in the z direction, what gives?
[19:39:48] <cadmio> I've divided x^3 + x^2 +1 by x - (1 +a +a^2) at the 1st passage I multiply by x^2 and subtract to get x^2 - x^2(1+a+a^2) +1
[19:40:04] <cadmio> what should I multiply for now?
[19:40:47] <Franciman> your new polynomial is x^2 (1 - 1 - a - a^2) + 1
[19:40:49] <Franciman> right?
[19:41:12] <cadmio> yes
[19:41:43] <Franciman> let's do some computation first: 1 - 1 - a - a^2 = -(a + a^2) = a + a^2
[19:41:51] <Franciman> so your polynomial is x^2 (a + a^2) + 1
[19:42:04] <Franciman> and it must be divided by x - (1 + a + a^2)

[19:44:52] <revolve9> Batzy, umm, why do you say d^2u_x/dz^2 = 0 ?
[19:45:18] <river> yes, to test if r is a root of P(X), just check if P(r) = 0.
[19:45:35] <river> if P(X) divides by (X-r) with no remainder, then r is indeed a root - but this is harder

[20:18:44] <river> so derangements are permutations where nothing is back in its original place
[20:19:03] <river> there are recurrence relations and such to count them
[20:19:15] <river> the notation is !n so the probability is !4 / 4!
[20:19:43] <mikoto-chan> I'm not familiar with !4 and I don't think it's required for this problem ://

[20:44:57] <river> mikoto-chan>	the answer is 9/24
[20:45:03] <river> perhaps !4 = 9  and 4! = 24
[20:45:05] <int-e> mikoto-chan: a lot of this is practice... learning to recognize the various shapes that the primitives (permutations, combinations, and whatnot) come in
[20:45:10] <river> mikoto-chan>	I'm not familiar with !4 and I don't think it's required for this problem ://
[20:45:13] <river> hmm maybe it is
[20:45:20] <river> maybe what you described is exactly a derangement
[20:45:24] <taeaad> In physics they mean that the transformation doesn't rotate.
[20:45:28] <int-e> river: again, you can just enumerate those 9 possibilities
[20:45:34] <river> and the reason i brought up !4 was *because* you are not familiar with it
[20:45:49] <int-e> But sure, !4 = 9.
[20:45:54] <river> yes you can learn to compute derangements for small numbers like 4 by hand
[20:46:07] <river> you can also do it without calling them derangements, not sure what the benefit would be
[20:46:22] <mikoto-chan> int-e: I just wrote down all the possibilities i.e. E,NE,NE,E ... and ended up with 6 possible results divided by 4^2

[20:47:25] <int-e> mikoto-chan: for the 6, that is actually an instance of combinations
[20:47:31] <mikoto-chan> int-e: 2 possibilities (even and uneven), 4 actions meaning 16 possible outcomes

[20:48:42] <int-e> mikoto-chan: the thing about having a name for the concept is that you can put it into a search engine and end up on Wikipedia (or similar places): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derangement

[22:38:37] <int-e> Jacques: What if I or J isn't finitely generated? Besides that, you're playing fast and loose with the quantifiers. It's probably better to introduce f and g *after* deciding which inclusion you want to prove.
[22:38:58] <int-e> And then you can be explicit about quantifiers more easily.

[22:44:13] <Jacques> int-e hm, good point. I had just assumed our field was algebraically closed and by Hilbert's Nullstellensatz our ideals are guaranteed to be finitely generated.
[22:44:14] <Jacques> Can you explain a little more about my quantifiers? Do you mean me deciding f,g in their respective ideals before the proof stuff is bad?
[22:44:36] <int-e> Jacques: yes that's what I mean
[22:45:06] <int-e> Jacques: the finitely generated part is a red herring... there's no need to think about generators at all

[22:45:53] <sek> (it's the Hilber Basis Theorem which gives finite generation, not the Nullstellensatz. Also, the Basis Theorem doesn't need k=k-bar)
[22:45:56] <Jacques> Oh. So, could I just say f,g in I and J and not define them?
[22:47:09] <Jacques> sek https://i.imgur.com/OgaV5Gx.png This says finite generation and I do not see a "hilbert's basis theorem" in my book (Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms)
[22:47:10] <int-e> The context should establish that I and J are ideals in some common polynomial ring.
[22:47:29] <int-e> You don't need more than that.
[22:47:51] <Jacques> Gotcha. Thank you, int-e, I will perform the modification now.
[22:48:51] <sek> Jacques: the thm in that image is indeed the Nullstellensatz. That every ideal in a polynomial ring over a field is finitely generated is basically the statement of the Basis Theorem though, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_basis_theorem

[22:53:12] <Jacques> "Let I, J \subseteq k[x_1, \cdots, x_n] and f in I and g in J"
