[15:02:02] <Carbonflux> i think its time for programmers to take over managing this pandemic stuff.
[15:02:34] <Carbonflux> these health care types are like the worst form of scriptkiddies 
[15:02:50] <Carbonflux> with no debugging skills or understanding of complex systems.
[15:03:03] <Carbonflux> they just keep making it worse.
[15:08:53] <ERROH> but science is liberal
[15:11:00] <T`aZ> not sure there was ever a goal to properly manage the situation in the first place
[15:11:59] <Bullit> topicology
[15:14:00] <Carbonflux> i have been thinking a lot about how little we know about MRNA vaccines, its reminding me of the opioid thing, MRNA is like showing the immune system a photo of the virus, rather than giving it a sample like old school vaccines, it suggests a subscription model to me, i think the MRNA vaccines will always need "boosters." 
[15:15:31] <Bullit> MetaReleaseNixonAble dont know but who does know in such situations where there is a potential that you might be aproached with a Syringe and Needle out which should land intraverneus
[15:15:42] <Bullit> Intermusculair intreveneus
[15:15:42] <Carbonflux> i think the pharma corps are leveraging the pandemic to create another "addiction market," but this time one that is mandatory.
[15:16:06] <Bullit> you mention that you feel like MRN
[15:16:54] <Carbonflux> bots are so mystical now days.
[15:16:57] <Bullit> therefore it is important to knowledge go onto contactable persons aproachable a porche abel
[15:17:37] <Bullit> exemplenary orifice of information in mystical for first of all the legendary you could go hunting for where that shound was played in myst
[15:18:36] <Bullit> Rwoorden
[15:19:54] * Bullit how the small operating cycle Bullit is R words ik verwacht dat ze wel op tijd kan typen dus hoeveel minuten aanstaan voor 121 aanslagen
[15:20:24] <Carbonflux> honestly i don't think any of the larger powers want to manage the situation, there is a lot to farm, for one thing climate change. If there is a conspiracy in all this i would argue its a group of people who want to leverage the pandemic to effect climate change.
[15:20:25] <Bullit> https://open.spotify.com/track/65vfhzbHsGalJGbnFHZ6sF?si=2b41c1a502154ffc
[15:20:42] <Carbonflux> after all, as a great man said, science is liberal.
[15:20:59] <Bullit> Winston Churchill proved by standing up out of a luger shot
[15:21:35] <Bullit> at the continuation
[15:21:39] <Bullit> dont you then have
[15:21:50] <Bullit> if must agree can agree but is the field 
[15:23:15] <Carbonflux> Bullit, the sense of gravity is rudiment, consciousness is perception, which is mass, therefore we all dream each other.
[15:25:29] <Bullit> that is correct 3500-3800 grams but your rudiment singular gravity or multipole gravity if its the simple adds and the reocuring simple tasks of deploy argue connect and comment
[15:26:32] <Carbonflux> and thus emerges various forms. Well said.
[15:27:03] <Carbonflux> where did you get the metric in grams from tho? thats interesting.
