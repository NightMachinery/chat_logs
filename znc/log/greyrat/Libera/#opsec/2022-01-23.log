[03:24:12] <Joanna> JimBuntu: you have illustrated the problem perfectly. All non british clothing has been relegated to special occasions and in the last two years the special occasions have all been cancelled putting the makers and sellers of non british clothes out of business.
[03:25:39] <Joanna> I lament that people refuse to wear non british clothes for everyday activities where suitable.

[03:30:32] <Joanna> I’ve dealt with people not being happy with what I’m wearing since I was a child dressed in clothes that were 20 years out of fashion so I don’t care what people think but oddly enough people seem to like the clothes that they are ashamed to wear.

[05:39:53] <Joanna> jan6: did you know that the british went to the trouble of traveling to remote islands to bully natives into not wandering around naked?
[05:40:57] <jan6> sure, so did the spaniards
[05:41:42] <jan6> that was never the real goal, of course, it was making "the other people" more like "our people"
[05:42:54] <jan6> same with religion
[05:43:15] <jan6> power and control, why fear the unknown, when you can force it to fit into the old
[05:43:55] <jan6> why bother understanding other cultures, when you can just show how clearly superior you are, and have them become more like you
[05:46:57] <jan6> 03:57 <Joanna> jan6: the dominant clothing around the world with the exception of few places
[05:47:03] <jan6> is nothing to do with brits, btw
[05:48:11] <jan6> it's a very simple and natural thing to come up with, and of course because of that, people from all over the world have come up with it, in different cultures, without needing brits for that
[05:48:40] <jan6> e.g. you just make cloth the shape of your leg
[05:50:54] <Hydragyrum> well the goal of them bullying ppl into wearing clothes was that people without clothes offended their morals
[05:51:29] <jan6> what I said about "make more like us" ;P
[05:53:41] <jan6> it's simply the most comfortable style of clothing, for most activities, fitting most conditions, whereas wearing a kilt or skirt or dress in the winter would probably be a lot less convenient, not to mention colder (unless you wear, y'know, pant-shaped stuff underneat, at which point why not skip half the trouble), similar stuff about shirts, 'n stuff, while you can do things differently, it's
[05:53:42] <jan6> mostly a volountary choice
[05:54:20] <jan6> on a warm island or rain forest, of course, it doesn't really matter if, or what, you wear

[05:54:41] <Hydragyrum> except for protection
[05:54:45] <jan6> (other than sunburn, yeah)
[05:55:03] <Hydragyrum> well in tropical climates there's worse things than sunburn to be concerned about
[05:55:26] <Hydragyrum> i.e. biting things
[05:55:35] <jan6> which a little bit fo cloth won't stop
[05:55:57] <jan6> clothing's main purpose IS protection, as it's always been, be it protection from dirt, cold, sun, or whatnot
[05:56:07] <Hydragyrum> depends on which biting things -- mosquitos, which spread malaria, for instance
[05:56:19] <jan6> they can TOTALLY go through clothing
[05:56:32] <jan6> you'd be surprised
[05:57:20] <jan6> it'd protect a little, I guess
[05:58:47] <jan6> but then there's also the question of, do you need to even be at a place with them? e.g. you can just hide away, keep moving, or stay around a fire (or, much less nice, some windy place or such)
[05:59:57] <jan6> (and of course, sane people would simply not live near the places where there's many of them, ANYWAY, if possible)
[06:01:31] <jan6> they don't tend to fly that far, and will settle for whatever happens to be nearby, be it a hot human, or a warm animal

[07:23:46] <Joanna> Hydragyrum: not only the morals but also enslaving  people economically by forcing them to work to have money to buy “proper clothes” that they didn’t need. Before They were happy with grass skirts which anyone could make for free.
[07:24:53] <Joanna> It probably worked like you need clothes oh now you are in debt and have to turn over your natural resources and be slave labor.
[07:26:43] <Joanna> jan6: one thing that is completely over looked is the environmental degradation and energy waste caused by production usage and disposal of clothing that was never necessary to begin with.

[07:49:22] <Joanna> There are specific traits of western style clothing that make them immediately recognizable. One of which is with few exceptions each item only properly fits a person of a specific size .

[15:47:14] <Joanna> Another trait about western clothing is it involves a lot of wasted cloth because of how it’s cut out. This was less true of medieval clothing.

[18:47:36] <JimBuntu> Joanna, I spend most of my time in non-brit clothing... it's Indian clothing, pajamas :)  Aside from that, I wouldn't mind wearing a great plaid while camping or hunting.  It really wasn't designed for modern 'city' life though. It's otherwise very very me though as it's so simple and yet versatile.
