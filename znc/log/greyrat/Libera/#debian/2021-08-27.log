[05:14:02] <jhutchins> knotMez:  You could recursively grep the hidden directories for a phrase known to be in a bookmark.
[05:14:30] <knotMez> jhutchins I could but I'd rather use lsof
[05:14:35] <Blondie101010> they use sqlite, but it could indeed get a binary match in grep
[05:15:33] <knotMez> jhutchins I tracked down a really weird browser issue once using lsof
[05:15:57] <knotMez> some pages would load with invisible fonts
[05:16:10] <knotMez> turned out I had a bad cache file
[05:16:53] <jhutchins> knotMez: They are not equivalent tools, but whatever floats your boat.
[05:17:10] <knotMez> jhutchins thanks
[05:17:19] <Blondie101010> "bad cache file" sounds like you don't know what cache is
[05:17:42] <knotMez> Blondie101010 the font was corrupt in teh cache file and it was causing me problems
[05:17:45] <Blondie101010> it is never 100% reliable
[05:17:50] <Blondie101010> it's always a compromise
[05:18:06] <knotMez> as soon as I deleted that file the problem went away
[05:18:17] <knotMez> so I'd call that a bad cache file
[05:18:26] <Blondie101010> which is why the first browsing troubleshooting steps include clearing cache and history
[05:18:31] <knotMez> maybe you have another name for it
[05:18:42] <knotMez> I did not want to clear my cache
[05:18:46] <Blondie101010> it doesn't matter what's there.. the problem was that it was invalid
[05:18:47] <knotMez> I like my cache
[05:18:54] <Blondie101010> so it needed to be cleaned
[05:19:06] <knotMez> yes but not with a sledgehammer
[05:19:12] <Blondie101010> it would have happened naturally some day but you could simply clear it

[05:20:02] <knotMez> jhutchins i was not the one asking for that help
[05:20:22] <Blondie101010> simple way to tell your browser to recheck everything, but don't expect it to cover 100% of the cases
[05:20:27] <Blondie101010> maybe 97%
[05:20:33] <jhutchins> knotMez: No, sorry.
[05:20:45] <knotMez> jhutchins tis OK

[05:22:07] <jhutchins> knotMez: No, not specifically.
[05:22:46] <greatcoof> 'firefox web.whatsapp.com' would do the job?

[05:25:21] <knotMez> Blondie101010 oh that wasn't a bug
[05:25:36] <knotMez> Blondie101010 some website just gave me a bum font
[05:25:49] * Blondie101010 nods
[05:26:00] <knotMez> Blondie101010 my browser kept on using it
[05:26:28] <knotMez> but it did drive me batty I thought it was the browser
[05:26:42] <knotMez> I changed it like 3 times
[05:26:54] <Blondie101010> in some perspective it might be considered as a bug, but I'm convinced it's designed that way to avoid having to ask users to load tiny things like fonts on a page load
[05:26:58] <Blondie101010> it'd be ugly!
[05:27:01] <knotMez> each new browser kept using that lousy font
[05:27:16] <Blondie101010> but it does indicate a security flaw
[05:27:40] <Blondie101010> flaw/weakness
[05:27:55] <knotMez> the browser thought it was doing its job
[05:27:58] <bobsy> before i go nuking my new debian bullseye install on my rpi4, could someone perhaps help me with bluetooth/audio not working?
[05:28:08] <Blondie101010> so you say that the font file was installed by one browser and then used by other browsers?
[05:28:27] <knotMez> was the same browser just different versions
[05:28:35] <Blondie101010> ok no difference then
[05:28:41] <knotMez> I think it was Firefox too?
[05:28:42] <Blondie101010> it's its own file
[05:28:59] <bobsy> i dont know if this is related to the bluetooth audio or not

[05:28:59] <knotMez> yeah a new browser will use your old files if they're there like an upgrade
[05:29:22] <Blondie101010> so there might be a very tiny security concern...  if you really want to go that route, report it to firefox support

[06:53:02] <muhblockchain> jhutchins: over 10 free
[06:53:53] <muhblockchain> or rather, like 4 gb free, thanks webbrowsers
[06:53:54] <jhutchins> Could just be buffering, but rsync has to do a lot of checksum work before it starts the actual transfer.  You might see if you can add the --progress switch.
[06:54:16] <Blondie101010> it prepares the file list first
[06:54:32] <jhutchins> muhblockchain: ftpsync is one of those "launch and go do something else" operations.
[06:54:53] <muhblockchain> allright it's working
[06:55:16] <jhutchins> muhblockchain: You should see what it takes to pull down a RedHat repo, even on big iron with a federal downlink.
[06:55:43] <muhblockchain> jesus that's a terribly coded program. so long hanging fruits.  echo "This will take around 5-30 minutes to get going, and hours to finish. No output. Logs will be in $LOGS and will grow after first 5-20 minutes"
[06:56:15] <jhutchins> Yup.  Expected.
[06:57:01] <muhblockchain> with ftpsync how to define which versions to get?
[06:57:06] <muhblockchain> like deb10, 11
[06:57:13] <jhutchins> muhblockchain: There are limits to what the client can do, the remote is a shared public-access service in fairly heavy use most of the time (especially this close to a release).
[06:57:52] <muhblockchain> it created dist/Debian8.11 I  hope it doesn't
[06:58:06] <muhblockchain> dists. oh it does

[14:30:32] <DoctorD90> jelly, i aim to use the local disk as live immutable image. I did it before on an hdd, and once dd-ed the image on the hdd, I could create on the remaining space an additional partition for data. Now the disk tells me "im full" :P no more space left for other partitions......So I think it is there something in the amangement of the NMVe (that I totally dont know)
[14:31:06] <jelly> DoctorD90, great, in that case, same question, what do you mean by "the disk tells me"
[14:31:28] <jelly> which tool are you using to try to partition the disk further?
[14:31:35] <DoctorD90> gparted
[14:31:47] <DoctorD90> "tells me" in a figurative way
[14:31:50] <jelly> have you tried parted instead?
[14:32:05] <jelly> or gdisk or fdisk?
[14:32:18] <DoctorD90> no. I dd-ed the image to the nmve and then opened with gparted
[14:32:44] <DoctorD90> are they so different that gdisk/gdisk/parted may gives so different outputs?
[14:32:44] <jelly> i have no idea what gparted uses behind the scenes.  Try to use a lower level tool.
[14:33:02] <jelly> gparted was mostly a GUI last time I used it (a long time ago)
[14:33:17] <jelly> ... that called other commands to do actual changes
[14:33:32] <DoctorD90> from my memory it used parted, but I could wrong
[14:33:42] <Khepra> Deepfriedice: whoops, sorry, that was for DoctorD90 :)
[14:33:56] <jelly> DoctorD90, also, parted output can be put into pastebin more easily
[14:34:04] <DoctorD90> btw, thanks! I thougth that I had to create different disk partition vie NVMe commands
[14:34:05] <Deepfriedice> No problem.
[14:34:17] <jelly> DoctorD90, that's highly unlikely
[14:34:18] <cadmio> jelly: maybe it's that "inet manual" that I should remove?
[14:34:39] <DoctorD90> i hope me too jelly ...
[14:35:01] <DoctorD90> Khepra, gparted just shows me the disk with no space left for other partitions :)
[14:35:01] <jelly> cadmio, no, that's important and tells ifupdown what to do at all.  Did you try managed mode instead?
[14:35:20] <DoctorD90> thanks! I will try with comd line tools :)
[14:35:28] <Khepra> isn't the live ISO a hybrid format of some sorts that I'm very much not familiar with, that isn't really suitable to be dd'd onto other media, like the SSD?
[14:35:30] <jelly> cadmio, I don't know what roaming mode vs managed mode mean, do you?

[14:45:13] <Khepra> and in this case you'd create an associated .link unit and set whatever MAC you want; iirc it even has teh ability to randomize without the need to specify one, if that's what you're after
[14:46:30] <cadmio> I think the problem is it's trying to change the MAC when the device has already been activated I should change the MAC first then the wpa_supplicant part
[14:47:04] <Khepra> cadmio: what actual problem are you seeing?

[15:01:06] <jelly> your output also shows run-parts: executing /etc/network/if-pre-up.d/macchanger

[18:49:53] <DoctorD90> theoretically yes, but i dont *really* know where the 3gb iso starts/ends...from lsblk i see that p2 the 3Mb (efi) and the p1 (real iso), from parted (as you stated now), and gdisk it outputs only the 3M...I could put as starting point 10giga ..but before to have to wipe and dd again I come back here :D jelly 
[18:50:00] <DoctorD90> no warning
[18:50:19] <DoctorD90> cause mbr is smaller then gpt definitions from my memroy
[18:52:02] <jelly> it's also possible gdisk ruined whatever was previously in MBR
[18:52:34] <DoctorD90> exactly for this I didnt save anything :P
[18:53:04] <jelly> no idea.  You can ask #debian-live over on irc.oftc.net whether bullseye images fit your use case 
[18:53:21] <DoctorD90> oh great! i didnt know of that channel
[18:53:26] <DoctorD90> thank you very much!!!
[18:53:29] <DoctorD90> (as usual)
[18:54:28] <jelly> I'd also ask them if there's a way to enable persistence with a second partition on the same media or not (any more), given that the partition table does not seem to protect the whole image any more

[19:26:23] *** Joins: diogenes_ (~diogenes_@94.178.60.109)
[19:26:30] <kyle__> I built and installed xv from source, for nostalgia I guess.  From gnome it still uses eog to open images, but now chromium is opening with xv.
[19:26:41] <kyle__> No alternatives point to xv.
[19:26:47] <kyle__> So I'm kindof confused/surprised.
[19:27:03] <Haohmaru> no idea, did you checked its settings?
[19:27:29] <kyle__> Yes.  And nothing in the settings let you choose an image viewer.
[19:27:31] <jhutchins> kyle__: I believe there's a setting within chrimium to choose which "helper" apps it uses.
[19:27:32] <kyle__> That I've found at least.
[19:27:47] <Haohmaru> i use Firefox, and i'd like to know why it chooses to "Open destination folder" with gnome's aweful file manager
[19:28:13] <jhutchins> happy-dude: Because you're running gnome?

[19:31:07] <kyle__> Yeah, it no longer shows anything for helper applications.  So strange.
[19:31:21] <kyle__> They're taking the apple "we've made all the decisions for you" approach I guess.
[19:31:59] <Haohmaru> google knows you better than you know yourself, so it can think and take decisions for you better than you can do

[19:32:59] <kyle__> I mean, I'm glad that somewhere, burried in the code, and old graybeard left "xv" as the preffered image viewer if it was available.  I really am.  I just want a way to override that so I can both have xv, and use a modern viewer by default :)

[19:36:08] <Haohmaru> yeah, scaling for the purpose of zooming in/out, when you open a huge image and set it to "scale to fit"
[19:36:14] <Haohmaru> "zoom to fit" actually
[19:36:41] <Haohmaru> it can be done via imagemagick, sure.. x_x

[19:37:06] <Haohmaru> the state is, almost everyone handles sRGB incorrectly

[19:37:30] <jelly> oh, you want correct colors
[19:37:58] <Haohmaru> yeah, a checkerboard black/white pattern, scaled to 50% should NOT make 128,128,128 sRGB

[21:57:43] <TheBigK> i have a raw copy still... but in master.info it seems the slave information is stored and not the master status

[23:01:23] <sussudio> use something like rescatux instead
[23:01:32] <greycat> you either limp by with what's actually on the installer, or you mount your Debian system and chroot into it and use those tools, or you find a different rescue disk

[23:37:52] <tesseract> i set up firefox to open 25 site tabs at launch. i mean it enters those 25 site automatically. but after that pulseaudio process starts eating cpu about %10 so i have to reboot pulseaudio service to fix that. it was happening on buster and after upgrading to bullseye it still happens. it is annoying to have to restart pulseaudio after ever firefox launch. what should i do?
[23:39:15] <starbreaker> tessaract: how are you getting firefox to open 25 tabs at launch? shell script?
