[06:39:53] <codingquark> Planning to mess with lsp-mode further while I drink coffeeeees
[06:39:57] <azod> that is not a bad thing though.
[06:40:12] <azod> cool, lsp mode is awesome
[06:40:14] <codingquark> Do you have some great tricks under your belt tonight?
[06:41:21] <codingquark> azod: oh you like lsp-mode?! Cool, what features do you use most, if you don't mind me asking? I started using it only yesterday for python, and so far, I have removed lsp-ui, company and tried removing automatically popping up sidelines but failed
[06:41:22] <azod> no, its pretty easy just make sure the path for your lsp executables are set
[06:41:41] <azod> the only lsp i use is ccls and the elixir lsp.
[06:42:15] <codingquark> Cool
[06:42:27] <azod> i like it as a quick way to pull down variable names though the project i'm working on.
[06:43:05] <azod> with elixir it helps a lot when i dont quite remember a module name. with C its helpful to quickly find that var, etc.

[07:34:30] <bpalmer> contrapunctus: as for joins/parts: not all clients do a good job of hiding them, and some people spam the channel or violate its guidelines with quit messages or their nicks, so somebody (such as ops) has to keep an eye on them.

[09:12:47] <codingquark> Much appreciated!
[09:12:54] <dale> codingquark: On my one project that uses 3.6, I installed 3.6.13 with direnv, then in the root of the project I dropped a .envrc file that contains only the line "layout pyenv 3.6.13" (without quotes).  "layout pyenv" comes builtin with direnv AFAIK (man direnv-stdlib).
[09:13:22] <dale> codingquark: Next time you're under that project root, direnv will then start bitching so you have to "direnv allow" IIRC.  (The bitching message tells you what to type, again IIRC.)
[09:13:44] <codingquark> Okay, time to create that .envrc file
[09:14:29] <dale> codingquark: Then I just put (envrc-global-mode) at the very end of my init.el (putting it at the end is suggested in purcell/envrc's README IIRC).
[09:15:50] <codingquark> dale: alright, I created the .envrc and the behavior was as you described. `direnv allow' said `direnv: export +PYENV_VERSION +VIRTUAL_ENV ~PATH`
[09:15:58] <codingquark> So that sounds alright

[09:16:30] <dale> codingquark: After that, next time you're in an Emacs buffer under that project root, such as dired or a Python buffer or whatever, M-: (getenv "VIRTUAL_ENV") RET should show you something like "/Users/codingquark/your-project-root/.direnv/python-3.6.13".  If purcell/envrc isn't picking it up maybe try M-x envrc-reload RET.
[09:16:32] <codingquark> Now I normally use virtualenv (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)?
[09:16:41] <dale> codingquark: And if you already had an LSP server running you may need to restart it.
[09:17:34] <dale> codingquark: Whenever you change into a directory under the project root, you should see direnv telling you it's set those environment variables, and when you cd out of the project root you should see direnv telling you it's unsetting them.
[09:17:57] <codingquark> Okay
[09:18:00] <dale> codingquark: direnv will make a virtualenv for you the first time you cd into the project root.  After that run something like "command -v pip" and you should see that it's running .../.direnv/python-3.6.13/bin/pip.
[09:18:43] <dale> codingquark: So you don't need to run virtualenv or venv yourself.  Whenever you're in the project root, assuming you've got direnv's shell integration running as prescribed by its README, anytime you're within the project root the virutalenv for that project automatically be activated.

I'm not very familiar with opentelemetry-python, I've only looked at it once or twice.
[09:58:49] <codingquark> dale: yes, that sounds like the right path

[09:59:30] <dale> Does seem weird perhaps.
[10:02:00] <codingquark> dale: what I am doing is to take sdk's TracerProvider, and use `trace` to `set_tracer_provider`. This sets sdk's TraceProvider, so, I _should_ be able to call `trace.get_tracer_provider().add_span_processor()`

[11:44:30] <spithash> yo yo, which auto completion package would you recommend for coding c/c++ for example? I'm using emacs on windows unfortunately and I'm having issues with lsp-clangd, I mean, it works but it can't find the headers files (at least this is what its complaining for) -- so I thought I should change to something else
[11:46:06] <empwilli> spithash: this is most likely not a problem that will be fixed by another completion system. 
[11:46:13] <empwilli> what build tools are you using?
[11:46:43] <empwilli> in cmake you have to explicitly turn on so that it also emits the paths to system includes in the compile_commands.json file 
[11:46:51] <spithash> empwilli:  I get the feeling that if I could make it work using g++ instead, it would work as expected, I'm only having this issue with clangd
[11:48:26] <empwilli> clangd is not a compiler
[11:48:29] <empwilli> g++ is a compiler
[11:48:33] <lampilelo> and gcc doesn't have a language server
[11:48:47] <empwilli> so again: what build system are you using?
[11:49:57] <spithash> hrm, I'm not quite sure.. all this is new to me, I started with emacs like a week ago
[11:50:11] <empwilli> nonono
[11:50:15] <empwilli> this doesn't depend on emacs
[11:50:19] <empwilli> your code base
[11:50:23] <empwilli> how are you building it?
[11:50:35] *** Joins: Dalvini (~nil@gw-natl-01.enercoop.org)
[11:50:53] <empwilli> I mean your c/c++ project, how are you building it
[11:51:18] <spithash> oh like I make a .cpp file and then I use g++ file.cpp -o file.exe -- it's only simle stuff for now, no makefiles etc... 
[11:52:27] <empwilli> ok, so no project after all. The thing is: clangd (and all the other major language servers) needs to know how you build your program, i.e. what compile flags you apply, where the include files it uses are found and so on
[11:52:59] <empwilli> typically that's stored in a file called compile_commands.json and there are multiple ways to get such a file (afaik you can even provide these settings globally)
[11:53:40] <empwilli> if clangd has no such file, it has no way of knowing where your includes come from (IMHO one could build clangd in a way that it has sane defaults but the developers decided against that)
[11:53:59] <spithash> oh I see
[11:54:23] <empwilli> one way of doing so would be bear: https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear
[11:54:28] <spithash> I really thought I was done with just setting the PATH environment alias for $HOME
[11:54:36] <empwilli> sadly no

[11:54:41] *** Joins: MrFantastik (~f@cpe-69-204-101-67.buffalo.res.rr.com)
[11:55:12] <empwilli> another way would be to get your build infrastructure (e.g. cmake, meson and alike) to auto generate these files for you
[11:56:11] <spithash> I want to mention here that I use spacemacs so I was hoping that at some point it kinda makes it's own environment? anyway.. I think know what you mean.. compile_commands.json is probably the issue here
[11:56:13] <lampilelo> meson generates it be default, for cmake you need to add for cmake you need to add -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=YES to your options
[11:56:39] <empwilli> probably you can also get away with setting each and every include dir in a global config: https://clangd.llvm.org/config
[11:57:16] <empwilli> the point is: projects are typically too diverse to provide a general way of auto generating these databases
[11:57:29] <empwilli> (which is the reason why these are auto generated by build systems)
[11:58:45] *** Joins: Midjak (~Midjak@82-65-111-221.subs.proxad.net)
[11:59:06] <empwilli> lampilelo: there's a gotcha, though, EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS won't include system headers ... for that you additionally have to specify CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
[11:59:16] <spithash> hrm... thank you, I'll check it out, thanks
[12:00:01] <spithash> bear looks convenient, I'll try it out

[13:08:42] <codingquark> About to clone 95 repositories in a bash script :-P I need to instrument as many of these as I can
[13:09:14] <vitus> hi guys! Does any1 know a bit about regular expressions? I need to determine the number of expressions following a specific pattern
[13:09:29] <empwilli> only with regexp?
[13:09:50] <vitus> if you know other ways, that's fine too
[13:09:59] * empwilli searches for the stack overflow article...
[13:10:00] <vitus> but I thought regular expressions are the way to go
[13:10:24] <empwilli> long and funny answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454
[13:10:44] <empwilli> short and not so funny: regexp in general are finite state machines, you can't count with finite state machines
[13:11:49] <empwilli> so you will always have a construct like: while (regex.match): count ++ or sth. like that
[13:11:57] <empwilli> (not lispy at all but I think you get the point)
[13:12:26] <vitus> I'm afraid I don't understand anything
[13:12:35] <vitus> I want to search a plain text file
[13:12:37] <empwilli> you know what a finite state machine is?
[13:12:42] <vitus> no
[13:12:53] <empwilli> this complicates matters :D
[13:13:28] *** Quits: grobi (~grobi@user/grobi) (Quit: "baby i'm bored ♞▀▄▀▄♝▀")
[13:13:38] <empwilli> CS 101; a finite state machine consists of states and transitions between states; e.g. a coffee machine, a state would be: what coffee do you like, a transition would be the button you press
[13:14:02] <empwilli> the issue is that this simplified model has no capabilities to count (otherwise you would have to model each count as a separate state)
[13:14:38] <empwilli> ~> regexp are nothing else but finite state machines and they transition depending on what they have seen and what the expression allows  them to "consume" next
[13:15:03] <empwilli> if you want to count, you can't model that with a finite state machine (FSM) ergo not directly with regexp
[13:15:16] <Donatzsky> vitus: Just to be clear: You want to count the number of occurences of a specific pattern?
[13:15:29] <empwilli> what you can do, however, is write a regexp that matches the pattern you are looking for, and every time it matches increment the count
[13:15:35] <wasamasa> M-x how-many
[13:16:20] <vitus> Donatzsky: yes, to be exact every occurnce of the form ",nnn " where n is a number between 0 and 9

[16:48:04] <krux02> I heared it had not too long ago an overhaul
[16:48:42] <krux02> I just looked it up, flymake requires the content of the file to be passed to the compiler via stdin.

[17:11:51] <Bayes> wgreenhouse you mentioned yesterday that using org-mode to organize yourself would take some non-trivial setup, otherwise default org-mode is like a list of TODOs and not much... can you expand on that? cause I want to get serious with organizing things better, but org-mode totally felt like a text list with a colored TODO keyword
[17:12:47] <Bayes> grym yes
[17:13:45] <bpalmer> Bayes: it's a little bit more than that, insofar as you can track deadlines, prepare an agenda , and have different wait states by default
[17:13:56] <bpalmer> it's not much more than that, but a little bit more.

[17:54:31] <corwin> Bayes: that may be an excellent use-case for literate programing IMO. Each script becomes a literate block, maybe some custom code to put a block counter into the name. In that case you'll just swap the blocks around, using the outline form to give your your high-level view
[17:54:44] <grym> ^ behold, the make file 
[17:55:40] <ldlework> also codeblocks can call other codeblocks
[17:55:58] <ldlework> so you can also do composition that way without modifying overall document structure

[18:01:33] <bpalmer> actually, wait. I actually looked at the values now rather than just testing in python.
[18:01:53] <Bayes> these are all jobs sent to the HPC run in different nodes at different times and they not need be executed in order really but more a way to organize a large collection of smaller tasks etc
[18:02:06] <bpalmer> Bayes: at any rate, consider a main.sh shell script that just runs everything in order. Call it main.graph.sh if you want to feel fancy
[18:02:12] <grym> ^^ 
[18:02:27] <grym> reordering lines in a file is a lot easier than renaming files
[18:02:40] <Bayes> but I don't need all of them to be always run in batch
[18:03:13] <bpalmer> Bayes: so you sometimes can skip steps 1 through 5, and only want to run stage 6?
[18:03:18] <Bayes> the order is more so when you browse the files you get a feel on the "natural order of things" but script 81 does not really depend on script 80, etc
[18:03:30] <Bayes> bpalmer yeah sometimes I just need to rerun some tasks
[18:04:23] <bpalmer> Bayes: if you're using numbers anyway, you can just have your shell script take optional arguments "[m [n]]*" ; if m alone is specified, just run that; if m and n are specified, run those bits; repeat as desired.

[18:20:31] <Youmu> Even `org-global-properties` has a (`APPT_WARNTIME_ALL` . "0:15") cons, no such a property completion when invoke `org-set-property`. It can be reproduced even with emacs -Q

[18:20:39] <corwin> sort of.  I'm working on the bits that are most like a VTT first as they reprazent "pushing boundaries" for Emacs.  Overall it's a generic "literate game engine".  The most important goal is to keep all content with the "owning" user in plain text formats with minimal mark(up|down).  In fact, all the data is in org-files, which can contain code blocks to introduce word/game specific behaviors./
[18:20:53] <Youmu> Does anyone else have the same issue?

Python is perfect for making sure your carefully hand-crafted program can eventually be problematically generated by an AI. Perl requires you to think about things like design patterns as there's no express requirement to follow any conventions of any sort -- this is a key reason people don't like supporting Perl applications (but love scripting for perl)
