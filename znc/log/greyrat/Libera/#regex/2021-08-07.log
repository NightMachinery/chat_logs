[18:33:05] <digitok> group 1
[18:33:32] <NiLon> digitok actually, it was that leading 0 increases the compatibility
[18:33:54] <digitok> it was a direct quote
[18:34:09] <digitok> but your alteration of wording doesn't change anything
[18:34:11] <digitok> it's the same claim
[18:34:23] <digitok> and it's still not the case
[18:34:29] <NiLon> no that is what I originally said
[18:35:48] <digitok> <NiLon> sure, but even then having the 0 increases to compatibility as 01x01 or S01x01 are more expected formats
[18:36:52] <NiLon> now that is better quote
[18:38:30] <NiLon> also do you happen to remember where I said that 99% are S01E01 and 1% is shared by retarded anomalies
[18:38:53] <digitok> i'm curious to know which software accepts 01x01 but not 1x01
[18:38:56] <digitok> since that's your claim here
[18:39:40] <NiLon> do you accept a defeat if I make one example of such software?
[18:39:56] <NiLon> do you rub my feet as well
[18:40:01] <digitok> sure, if it's more widely used than kodi
[18:40:12] <digitok> otherwise i'd need more examples
[18:40:33] <NiLon> in other words no matter what example I give it doesn't make a difference
[18:40:41] <digitok> no
[18:40:43] <NiLon> I'm not playing
[18:40:58] <digitok> you can provide one example if it's more widely used than kodi, otherwise you can provide multiple examples
[18:40:59] <NiLon> "more widely used" by what metric that works
[18:41:08] <digitok> i.e. one obscure program doesn't count
[18:41:41] <NiLon> is windows media player more widely used than kodi?
[18:42:04] <NiLon> how the fuck would anyone know that
[18:42:15] <digitok> possibly, if anyone still uses that
[18:43:11] <digitok> unlikely that many pirates use it though
[18:43:15] <digitok> :D
[18:43:51] <NiLon> but no I don't play if you don't set easily verifiable criteria before the fact
[18:44:12] <NiLon> moving goalpost chace is pointless
[18:44:13] <digitok> ok, the criteria is that i've heard of it
[18:44:17] <digitok> :)
[18:44:41] <NiLon> not good enough, I only accept objective one
[18:45:22] <digitok> it should be, i have the same 20 odd years of exposure to these things as you do
[18:45:28] <digitok> if it's worth caring about i would've heard of it
[18:46:12] <NiLon> that has multiple problems
[18:46:38] <NiLon> first problem is that if you are not aware of it then it could mean that it is the reason why you are arguing the opposite
[18:47:07] <NiLon> basically you are making argument based on the ignorance and any evidence against that ignorance would not be allowed
[18:47:15] <digitok> it doesn't matter really, because my argument wasn't against "increases compatibility" but that "0x01 is a 07more expected format than 1x01  "
[18:47:21] <NiLon> basically any evidence to prove you wrong would be disqualified
[18:47:36] <NiLon> because you are not aware of it, that is stupid
[18:47:38] <digitok> which would require you to name some software more prevalent than kodi, emby, plex, etc
[18:47:41] <digitok> which you can't
[18:47:59] <digitok> 01x01*
[18:48:32] <NiLon> problem is that you don't know my cards that I'm playing with
[18:48:49] <digitok> i know you're playing with something
[18:50:41] <digitok> basically, i've named some very well known software that "expects" the opposite of what you claim to be "more expected", so until you can do the same, you have no real argument
[18:51:18] <digitok> but, feel free to do so, i'm genuinely curious
[18:52:22] <NiLon> no point because you won't accept it
[18:52:40] <NiLon> not playing the shifting goalpost game
[18:53:17] <digitok> good cop out
[18:54:08] <digitok> there's no shifting goalposts, what i said at the beginning still stands, <digitok> NiLon, no, the whole argument is your claim that 01x01 is "a more expected format than 1x01"
[18:54:15] <digitok> all i'm asking is for you to prove it
[18:54:26] <digitok> so far, nothing
[18:56:00] <digitok> and no, i wouldn't accept some shit like wmp
[18:59:51] <NiLon> and that is the problem frankly
[19:00:15] <NiLon> because compatibility isn't about something working with most used things
[19:00:19] <NiLon> but least used things
[19:01:30] <NiLon> basically playing into survivor bias
[19:02:59] <NiLon> this story if good example https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2010/09/counterintuitive-world/
[19:03:03] <NiLon> is*
[19:07:06] <digitok> the only problem is you being stuck on the idea that i'm arguing against it being more compatible
