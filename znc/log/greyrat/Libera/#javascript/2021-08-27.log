[00:00:46] <GreenJello> if you do just want to check that it was called, then a normal mock is fine
[00:00:48] <ljharb> sure, you can do that too
[00:00:59] <ljharb> by not calling through, and then grabbing the callbacks out of the calls property

[00:01:32] <GreenJello> hmm
[00:01:41] <GreenJello> I guess that would work
[00:01:46] <ljharb> the main reason to use one of those instead of rolling your own is all the edge cases around property descriptors, and restoring the original state
[00:04:49] <linguist> I think I´ll need to specify timestamp, because this updaterFunction recalculates the position of an object in a canvas and calls this function requesting the animation frame again over and over

[00:24:31] <carlino3> i'm writting a multiplayer turn-based card game using websockets and node for the backend. i plan to store the game state in a relational SQL database. do you think this is a good idea? what is the most common approach for this use case?

[00:27:02] <GreenJello> should work fine for small scale, but it's overall more efficient to store it in memory and route both players to the same game server
[00:28:12] <GreenJello> the central RDBMS might even work fine at larger scale if you don't have a ton of queries happening all the time
[00:28:50] <GreenJello> it does sound harder to implement, though
[00:30:23] <Maxdamantus> ashnur: () => {}
[00:30:32] <carlino3> right, the problem with that is horizontal scaling. two players that want to play together may be on different servers
[00:31:01] <carlino3> re-routing one of them to the same server as the other player sounds weird for me
[00:31:20] <theskillwithin> carlino3 nice, which card game?
[00:31:42] <carlino3> also, if server unexpectedly crashes, game state is lost
[00:32:16] <carlino3> theskillwithin very similar to poker

The point of a monorepo is to set it up so that you have a centrally managed repository, and developers that need to work on subtrees of that repository who have the ability to clone down and work with just a small subset of the files. I.e. that they don't need to clone the

So instead of packages/A depending on packages/B via package.json, package/A could just include what it needs from packages/B via standard require(). At least, that's the theory anyway.

[04:09:45] <ljharb> moldorcoder7: ok so a few things
[04:09:58] <ljharb> moldorcoder7: a) never put JS inside your html like that (unless that's pseudocode for react)
[04:10:13] <ljharb> b) if that's actual html, it's `onclick` not `click`
[04:10:26] <ljharb> c) never use `onclick` or similar, use JS to add event listeners
[04:10:53] <ljharb> d) if you want a clickable thing that prompts users to download a file, make it a URL to a server that sets the right headers rather than monkeying around with JS and the download attribute
[04:12:51] <GreenJello> looks like angular

[10:21:43] <bobdobbs> I'm trying to set up a build pipeline for a simple project, and I'm having insane difficulties. Usually I use Gulp with gulp-uglify to minify my javascript. But when I used a simple gulp function for this, the task produced no output. In other words, I put code into the pipeline and nothing came out...
[10:22:13] <birkoff> which library or framework should I use to write a small application that displays various views of the same data set? it will have a navbar on top to switch views which will all use the same database

[13:09:52] <synaps3> Koopz, this is to complicated for me haha
[13:10:59] <DPA> You already have if(!confirm('Are you sure ?')) for when the user clicks abort. That's the case in which you need to call it.

[20:28:11] <systemfault> The fact that you wasn't sure about it should be a good hint for cis to prefer the former.

[20:28:25] <ljharb> ^ use that

[20:34:36] <systemfault> To me, that code doesn't make sense...

[20:35:09] <guideX> there'll also be an autocomplete thingy elsewhere etc
[20:35:13] <systemfault> You're calling some magic GenericAjax function... which I supposed is a asynchronous computation (delayed)
[20:35:17] <GreenJello> guideX, it works because `var` doesn't care if you redeclare the same variable, which is a quirk
[20:35:38] <guideX> systemfault, yeah genericajax is just, something I made up so I don't have to type so much
[20:35:40] <ljharb> ThePendulum: it's a JS idiom, and it's better to convert your codebase to use it
[20:35:45] <GreenJello> in modern code you'd do: case "By Position": { const data = {

[20:37:05] <GreenJello> (in your current code you could access `data` after the switch statement, which is weird)
[20:37:20] <systemfault> guideX: It has implications how what the function will return (Promise or nothing?) and if the function will require an extra argument (a callback if not using promise)
[20:39:16] <systemfault> There's also a violation of the law of demeter... there's no reason that function should have the node selection hardcoded in it.

[20:47:32] <guideX> yeah that's pretty much what I was shooting for, otherwise sometimes yuou are halfway down a page, and a popup or something is involved, it looks weird if you scroll up

[21:00:46] <de-facto> i want user expandable hierarchical data structures to be displayed in a table/grid that is sortable (within the leafs, e.g. on same hierarchy level) and allows for searching/filtering
[21:01:48] <de-facto> then the user should be able to choose by checkboxes on desktop/mobile devices

[21:03:15] <GreenJello> unlikely
[21:04:09] <guideX> slight improvement? https://pastebin.com/raw/p40neupW at least I don't declare data over and over :/
[21:04:15] <guideX> my js isn't too good I guess
[21:04:48] <GreenJello> that does look better

[21:05:57] <GreenJello> main thing missing is a default branch
[21:06:20] <GreenJello> you should probably throw a helpful error if you can't match the text
[21:07:12] <guideX> genericajax does all that, the service will have a "Success" and if it's false, it'll show the error popup etc
[21:07:40] <guideX> there'll be a "Message" with some error text, and an array of ValidationErrors and more things etc
[21:08:19] <GreenJello> you lose the .val() there, though
[21:08:32] <GreenJello> so your error reporting service can't tell you what went wrong
