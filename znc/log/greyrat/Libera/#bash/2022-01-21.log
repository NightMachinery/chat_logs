[03:03:39] <wiscii> i just mean, this is a vector of user "misuse" (intended or not) that I had not thought of before
[03:05:52] <Earnestly> wiscii: The question is if that misuse is in the same category as the misuse they could achieve with a shell of their own
[03:07:01] <Earnestly> The other aspect is if an uncontrolled (to the user) thirdparty can supply arbitrary commands which run on the users machine (as their user or otherwise)

[03:37:41] <wiscii> so not* not snot
[03:38:09] <tirnanog> it forks but does not exec (replace itself), as would be the case where launching a conventional sub-process.
[03:38:25] <wiscii> also, very much worth avoiding in any sort of loop

[03:39:27] <tirnanog> technically, there could be other ways to implement the requirements of a subshell but that's the obvious - and common - way to do it.
[03:39:39] <wiscii> a subshell launcing grep is even more expensive
[03:39:43] <larryv> don't be so absolutist about avoiding it. it's a judgment call
[03:40:10] <wiscii> larryv: yes sure, otherwise it would not be useful :)

[03:47:56] <wiscii> my inclination tells me that, if my script is suuffering badly from subshelling etc. then use a more suitable language .. still, doesn't hurt to try :)

[03:54:02] *** Quits: jmdaemon (~jmdaemon@user/jmdaemon) (Quit: ZNC 1.8.2 - https://znc.in)
[03:54:22] <emanuele6> more than switching to a more suitable language, consider refactoring your script to not use external programs.

[03:54:42] <emanuele6> that might be done switching to another programming language
[03:55:38] <emanuele6> generally exec() is more expensive than fork(). but sometimes what takes the most time is the "startup time" of the external program.
[03:56:53] <Blondie101010> you mean to execute the same program?  if so, fork+exec will be much slower for nothing than just a fork
[03:57:25] <emanuele6> > consider refactoring your script to not use external programs.
[03:59:15] <wiscii> i have already done that quite extensively
[03:59:24] <emanuele6> Blondie101010: i mean the time before the command actually does what it needs to do. https://0x0.st/o-G_.txt

[04:27:05] <e36freak> it's not a standard command
[04:27:18] <emanuele6> !rename
[04:27:18] <greybot> rename(1) could be one of three or four different programs -- or you might not have it on your system. A loop or find expression that uses mv is safer. See also !faq rename
[04:27:19] <e36freak> i don't know which one you have, but i can give you a portable solution that doesn't use rename

[04:29:12] <e36freak> that will also add the extension to other files that already have an extension
[04:29:20] <emanuele6> loganlee: yeah, that looks like the rename program written in perl
[04:29:48] <e36freak> you could use !(*.*) # with extglob enabled and use that
[04:29:52] <e36freak> instead of *
[04:30:03] <emanuele6> there is another more popular program named "rename" (that comes preinstalled on arch linux with the util-linux package) with completely different syntax
[04:30:08] <e36freak> or just for f in !(*.*); do mv "$f" "$f.txt"; done # and be portable

[17:36:53] <darkstorm> thanks Earnestly
[17:36:58] <Soliton> !&&
[17:36:58] <greybot> Short-circuit control operators <http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashSheet#Tests> A || B means "Run A. If A fails, run B." A && B means "Run A. If A succeeds, run B." Example: foobar || { echo "error" >&2; exit 1; }
[17:37:06] <Razva> @osse : was this for me?
[17:37:11] <Soliton> yes.
[17:37:47] <Soliton> && checks the exit status. it is unrelated to running commands in the background.
[17:38:10] <Razva> ah, ok, so basically && means that if the command fails the script will stop?

[17:38:34] <Soliton> if you call exit somewhere, sure.
[17:38:43] <Razva> got it
[17:38:58] <Soliton> cmd1 && cmd2  means the cmd2 will only be called if cmd1 succeeds.
[17:39:28] <Soliton> the script will still continue normally.
[17:39:43] <Soliton> perhaps you're talking about set -e.
[17:39:46] <Soliton> !-e
[17:39:46] <greybot> "set -e" is an inheritance of the old bourne shell, and doesn't really work well with modern shell features. You'll really have less buggy scripts if you do the error handling manually instead of relying on the unreliable "set -e"; see http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/105
[17:39:46] <djph> note that there's a caveat with teh && and || operations that trips people up, and I can't remember the factoid trigger for
[17:40:15] <Earnestly> !&&||
[17:40:15] <greybot> foo && bar || baz is not equivalent to 'if foo; then bar; else baz; fi'. In the former case, baz will happen if *either* foo *or* bar return false. In the latter case, baz will only trigger if foo returns false, regardless of the exit code for bar. See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls
[17:41:02] <djph> that's the one!
[17:41:32] <Razva> What I need is simple. I have a script with (let's say) 3 lines. I want line 2 to be executed only after line 1 finishes the "work". For example if I `apt install` something, line 2 should wait for the `apt` command to finish installing stuff.
[17:42:05] <Soliton> commands run one after the other by default.
[17:43:28] <Earnestly> Razva: That's how it normally works
[17:43:37] <Earnestly> Usually
[17:44:11] <Earnestly> Some tools will return immediately, but usually they return once they exit which typically means they have concluded their task

[22:16:11] <andreea> Thanks, super cool tips, however the merge should be following as: 01.pdf, 02.pdf (page numbers of a newspaper), so I assume issuing * would mix the pages.
[22:16:31] <rsjw> why does http://codepad.org/3ONwXM1I/raw.txt hang on the first exec, but if I switch the order of the execs, it doesn't hang?
[22:16:35] <Soliton> * expands ordered.
[22:16:37] <Earnestly> I wonder if ./mergepdf is executed in the directory, and so ./mergepdf needs to exist in each one.  I'm not familiar enough with gnuisms to know the details
[22:16:51] <hsv_> Soliton: hmm, why does it look like that?
[22:17:06] <Soliton> because you put the command in one big string.
[22:17:14] <andreea> mergepdf works in every directory as it's defined in PATH
[22:17:31] <Soliton> so don't use ./mergepdf then.
[22:17:33] <Earnestly> ./ is not running from PATH
[22:17:39] <emanuele6> then why were yourubning it as ./mergepdf?
[22:17:48] <andreea> Yeah, just an example
[22:17:51] <hsv_> andreea: https://mywiki.wooledge.org/UsingFind

[22:19:30] <Soliton> of course since the output file is called all.pdf if you run this again it'll include that.

[22:20:36] <Soliton> if you don't expect a shell just call the command normally.
[22:20:45] <Soliton> no...
[22:20:48] <Earnestly> andreea: No
[22:21:05] <Soliton> no idea why you would involve find at all but you can certainly.
[22:21:08] <emanuele6> andreea: no, as said before, hsv_ doesn't understand how find works
[22:21:09] <Earnestly> andreea: You're expecting a command literally called 'mergepdf 01.pdf 02.pdf ... -out all.pdf' to work?
[22:21:29] <emanuele6> Earnestly: they copied what hsv_ sent before
[22:21:32] <andreea> This is FreeBSD by the way.
[22:21:35] <Earnestly> andreea: Not mergepdf with arguments, a string 'mergepdf 01 ... all.pdf'
[22:21:45] <hsv_> oh, ok... lose the single quotes, sorry.
[22:21:57] <Soliton> you also need a starting point.
[22:22:12] <Earnestly> emanuele6: I know they're copying hsv_' silly thing, but they're also now asking about it too as if they didn't actually read or think about anything which preceeded it
[22:22:31] <andreea> mergepdf is the command, space PDF files (in order of: 01....12) and then the command "out" and a space with output final filename.
[22:22:40] <hsv_> find . -type d -execdir mergepdf {00..12}.pdf -out all.pdf \;
[22:22:44] <hsv_> happy?
[22:22:46] <andreea> mergepdf 01.pdf 02.pdf out all.pdf
[22:22:55] <emanuele6> hsv_: no.
[22:23:02] <Soliton> i would put options first but maybe that works.
[22:23:26] <emanuele6> only works if you assume that every directory has {00..12}.pdf.
[22:23:32] <emanuele6> and only those
[22:23:35] <Soliton> there is no reason to use find if you have just a set of dirs though.
[22:23:37] <hsv_> emanuele6: they said so.
[22:23:41] <Earnestly> emanuele6: That expands before find runs surely
[22:24:01] <Soliton> find is useful if you have a dir hierarchy.
[22:24:02] <tirnanog> "each of them contain 12 PDF files". doesn't seem so bad.
[22:24:04] <andreea> Every directory has 01.pdf ...till 12.pdf, yep.
[22:24:14] <Earnestly> { } expands before command is executed
[22:24:21] <emanuele6> yes, i know
[22:24:47] <Earnestly> It is rare, but find isn't always executed in a shell
[22:25:06] <Earnestly> It's quite funny seeing a find command without any of the quoting needed due to the shell
[22:25:09] <andreea> And each of those directories should have all.pdf in the end. (12 pdf files merged)
[22:25:36] <Soliton> well, you have multiple solutions by now.
[22:25:39] <hsv_> andreea: did you look at the link?
[22:26:03] <emanuele6> hsv_: you don't need find, Soliton has already sent a solution without find.
[22:26:52] <Earnestly> find . -type d -execdir sh -c 'mergepdf *.pdf -out all.pdf' \; # If this was me, and it was a oneoff, just to do a bit of merging

[23:17:14] <rsjw> open(2) does mention that "waiting for carrier on a dialup line" could cause open() to block. also it can return ENXIO if "O_NONBLOCK and O_WRONLY are set, the file is a FIFO, and no process has it open for reading". that doesn't exactly say it'd block if you don't have O_NONBLOCK, but I guess it's something you could guess
[23:18:47] <emanuele6> this one? https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/System/Conceptual/ManPages_iPhoneOS/man2/open.2.html
[23:19:15] <rsjw> also, it only mentions if it's being opened for writing, not reading
[23:19:40] <emanuele6> rsjw: the opening mode doesn't matter
[23:20:04] <emanuele6> in your case the blocked calls were both reads, but O_WRITE would also block
[23:20:05] <rsjw> emanuele6: that would be why its omission in the manpage is problematic
[23:20:35] <emanuele6> that seems to be an unmodified man page from a 1993 BSD.
[23:20:58] <rsjw> emanuele6: yeah I think that iphone man page is the same as what I have on my system
[23:21:18] <emanuele6> rsjw: it is not an iphone man page i don't think
[23:21:30] <rsjw> it says so in the link
[23:21:37] <emanuele6> yeah
[23:21:40] <larryv> it's akin to the other BSD open(2) pages. it basically assumes that you know that it blocks and only notes that O_NONBLOCK changes that

[23:22:38] <rsjw> so then the real issue here is that I don't have fifo(7)?
[23:23:01] <emanuele6> rsjw: it says iPhoneOS in the URL; the title says Mac OS X Manual Page; the page header says iOS Manual Pages and a paragraph in the page says "This document is a Mac OS X manual page."
[23:23:28] <emanuele6> so i think it is more likely it is a Mac OS X man page rather than an iPhoneOS man page, but who knows

[23:23:33] <emanuele6> maybe it's for both
[23:23:39] <rsjw> like I said, man pages on osx are a bit broken
