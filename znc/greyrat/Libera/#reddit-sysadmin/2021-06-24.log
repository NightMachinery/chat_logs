[04:54:56] <torchic_> im not werin pans haha :3
[04:55:13] <signofzeta> Yeah, and FTP couldn't survive NAT easily.  Hopefully IPv6 saves it, or at least its TLS variant.
[04:55:37] <catbeard> i mean yeah there's FTPS/FTPES
[04:55:51] <catbeard> but for that there's FTP helpers

[04:58:32] <catbeard> and then there's FXP and FXPS/FXPES
[04:59:37] <signalblue> catbeard: what's the point of that
[04:59:43] <catbeard> none
[04:59:48] <catbeard> it just exists is all

[04:59:55] *** Quits: fmy (~fmy@tp-183-32.tm.net.my) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[04:59:57] <signofzeta> Modern NAT routers can handle FTP, but that wasn't a thing back then.
[05:00:10] <signalblue> what would happen?
[05:00:41] <signofzeta> it just wouldn't work.  the router would open one of the ports, but not the other.
[05:00:53] *** Quits: XV8 (~XV8@2601:5cb:c001:50:5992:6ab6:586d:9e24) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[05:00:56] <signofzeta> FTP added a PASV ("passive") option later on, but then we figured out how to send files over HTTP(S).
[05:01:21] <signalblue> signofzeta: and so router manufacturers fixed that issue?
[05:01:43] <xe0n> fxp ++
[05:01:45] <signofzeta> signalblue: they just added some logic to NAT so that it could detect FTP connections and handle them correctly.
[05:01:52] *** Joins: fmy (~fmy@115.134.28.48)
[05:02:00] <catbeard> if you were trying to FTP out from a NAT environment, the PORT command would tell the FTP server to set the return address as 192.168.x.x instead of wan.ip where a wan port was not mapped back to the FTP client
[05:02:00] <xe0n> i use fxp all the time lol
[05:03:08] <signalblue> sounds like you need to put the server and client in DMZ or something
[05:03:11] <signofzeta> I use SFTP, SharePoint Online, Dropbox, or sneakernet, depending on where I am.  Remind me to look up this FXP thing.
[05:03:31] <signofzeta> yeah, FTP servers would be DMZ'd, but clients wouldn't be.

[05:12:06] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> so not terribly unsurprising
[05:12:13] <signofzeta> if you sent it with Send-MailMessage, SPF would pass.  DKIM, if you have a signer on the Exchange server.  Then, DMARC too.
[05:12:34] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> oh yea
[05:12:40] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> it was from @dumain.com too
[05:12:46] <catbeard> hopefully you have DMARC in ruf

[05:13:10] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> lol this was like 6 years ago on exchange 2013
[05:13:24] <signofzeta> I only use DMARC "rua".  I tried "ruf" and it was rough.
[05:13:38] <signofzeta> If there's an actual problem, I implement "ruf" temporarily.
[05:14:20] <catbeard> hi yes this is "Hunterkll <Hunterkll@libera.chat>" <anon@someserv.dumain.com>
[05:15:44] <catbeard> signofzeta: https://report-uri.com
[05:16:03] <signofzeta> oh, they added DMARC support?  I use them for HTTP Everything.
[05:16:13] <catbeard> esp useful for CSP/CSPRO
[05:17:34] <signofzeta> yeah, I use them for all the web stuff.  didn't realize they added DMARC.  I've been using Postmark for aggregate DMARC reports.
[05:18:10] <catbeard> oh yeah, much easier to just filter
[05:18:17] <catbeard> all in one place
[05:19:53] <catbeard> i used to just have a laravel POP email parser that parsed all the reports we get via email (FBL, DMARC, RT, Login notifications)
[05:20:07] <signofzeta> Nothing against Postmark.  They're great for aggregate DMARC reports.  They don't support MTA-STS, though.
[05:20:33] <catbeard> mine did, sorta, opportunistic tls, not really mta-sts
[05:20:41] <catbeard> basically smtp_security_level=may
[05:21:27] <catbeard> or w/e postfix sets, it's been a while since i actually had to use postfix
[05:21:44] <catbeard> but hot damn postscreen and opendkim milters
[05:21:51] <signofzeta> I'm talking _tlsrpt.contoso.com (I think, off the top of my head).
[05:22:09] <catbeard> watch someone registers contoso.com when it kicks
[05:22:15] <catbeard> probably backordered to all hell
[05:22:15] <signofzeta> lol
[05:22:41] <catbeard> like what domain was it that microsoft had to gank to smoke some botnet

[05:23:06] <signofzeta> oh, no then.  I don't know.

[05:24:49] <catbeard> no
[05:24:53] <catbeard> that wasn't it

[05:25:20] *** Quits: redstarcomrade (uid99592@user/redstarcomrade) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[05:25:39] <catbeard> and that whoever controlled it would have quite a lot of influence on those that had it set as that domain
[05:25:47] <catbeard> like example.com or some shit
[05:26:19] <catbeard> geez just think of how many people running default confs (both windows and linices)
[05:26:31] <signofzeta> I think example.com had something like that happen, but it wasn't malware-related, it was idiot-related.
[05:26:37] <catbeard> yeah
[05:26:55] <catbeard> pretty much, it lapsed and someone bid/won but M$ took it back
[05:28:39] <signalblue> dmarc sucks
[05:28:48] <catbeard> that's because you ain't do it right
[05:28:53] *** Quits: silentfury (~anubis@user/silentfury) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[05:28:54] <catbeard> takes at least 2 weeks to DMARC a domain
[05:28:57] <catbeard> the right way
[05:29:21] <signofzeta> I can DMARC a domain in two minutes.  It's only a problem when they sign up for Constant Contact and don't read CC's documentation or warnings.
[05:29:21] <sd> 10<n​emisys> they probably sold it back to MS for some exorbitant fee
[05:29:58] <catbeard> step through quarantine pct +10-20% each step, review, switch to reject start at 0%, step through again and reject up to 100%
[05:30:12] <signofzeta> "Our newsletters are bouncing."  "Did you follow CC's self-authentication steps?"  (No, they didn't, because they would have had to contact me to change DNS.)  "Yes, we did."
[05:30:46] <catbeard> i mean if you're adding it to someone that's already sending lots of emails, but doesn't have DMARC implemented yet
[05:30:53] <signofzeta> catbeard: you can step up, or ignore it if you know your organization's mail flow.
[05:30:56] <catbeard> and wonder why they're not inboxing
[05:31:09] <catbeard> yeah, but you're gonna get people spoofing your mail, that's just a fact of life
[05:31:20] <signofzeta> catbeard: I usually just do it, but I know my customers well.  I usually go "p=none; pct=100" and then "p=quarantine; pct=100".
[05:31:31] <catbeard> and there's also redelivery/reorigination e.g. gmail filters with forward flag
[05:31:46] <signofzeta> yes, but that should be DKIM's job, which DMARC respects.
[05:31:55] <catbeard> perfectly valid, just not DKIM/SPF aligned if you don't use Google for SMTP
[05:32:31] <signalblue> signofzeta: it's just a TXT record for DMARC... not too hard :)
[05:32:42] <catbeard> which means you then have to have GWS added to SPF and a Google DKIM record for it's mail to be signed outbound for reorigination
[05:32:54] <catbeard> at least, if you want it to inbox
[05:33:00] <signofzeta> If your email originates from Google, yeah.
[05:33:11] <catbeard> say the @gmail recipient has a filter forwarder that re-originates to their ISP email
[05:33:13] <signofzeta> With Exchange Online, I just do SPF and DKIM, and then DMARC falls into place.
[05:33:27] <catbeard> or the filter uses Send As with the reoriginating filter
[05:33:38] <catbeard> then you're subject to their SPF/DKIM/DMARC xD
[05:33:45] <signofzeta> Of course, Microsoft is lazy with updating their own SPF records, and their DKIM signer sometimes misses a message or two, but by and large, I have 100% alignment with them.
[05:33:53] <signalblue> yeah
[05:34:13] *** Quits: Gorian (~default@134.134.139.71) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[05:34:13] <signofzeta> And when will Microsoft implement DKIM with ed25519 signatures?  Not soon.
[05:34:19] <signalblue> I host my own mail server on Postfix and nameserver on nsd as well
[05:34:20] <signofzeta> But it works well enough.
[05:34:35] <signofzeta> Me too, signalblue.  Postfix admin here.
[05:34:44] <signalblue> Postfix is crazy awesome
[05:34:53] <e1> I wish I could call myself a postfix admin but it just works so well that i forget /how/ it works
[05:34:59] <catbeard> postsuper -d ALL
[05:35:01] * catbeard clocks out
[05:35:04] <e1> lol..
[05:35:05] <signalblue> ^^ this ^^
[05:35:06] <e1> I've done that
[05:35:10] <signofzeta> But you need to plug in things, like dkimpy-milter, OpenDMARC, and screw it, hashcash-milter because why not.
[05:35:22] <catbeard> or just postscreen
[05:35:25] <e1> grep out legit mail, put it to the side, nuke 1k+ spam, bring queue back in, deliver and off you go
[05:35:25] <signalblue> i have a catch-all on like 3 or 4 domains with postfix
[05:35:29] * signofzeta Googles that
[05:35:31] <e1> fucking users with jank passwords
[05:35:33] <signalblue> but that's pretty standard stuff
[05:36:07] <signofzeta> I'll look into Postscreen.  I've just been feeding SpamAssassin all kinds of rules.
[05:36:19] <catbeard> there's some stuff on github e.g. sixarm postfix configs, might have to google it, some pretty cool header check (.cf) scripts
[05:36:21] <e1> I would like postfix to have more complex rules for filtering mail though
[05:36:36] <signofzeta> Unfortunately, my email is firstname@firstnamelastname.tld, and I've had it since 2006, so it's very much out there.
[05:36:40] <e1> like "if sender IP is x and the domain is y, send it to z"
[05:36:52] <catbeard> you can also write custom perl milters
[05:37:02] <catbeard> there was uh
[05:37:05] <signofzeta> I don't know Perl, only C and PowerShell.
[05:37:06] <catbeard> policyd-weight
[05:37:10] <catbeard> which was really nice
[05:37:28] <signofzeta> I switched SpamAssassin to the TxRef plugin (I think that was it), and it's gotten much better.
[05:37:38] <catbeard> then there's pyzor
[05:37:47] <catbeard> and DCC
[05:38:25] <catbeard> and assholes using uceprotect
[05:38:30] <catbeard> as validation filters
[05:39:03] <e1> perl is love
[05:39:05] <e1> perl is life
[05:39:11] <e1> uceprotect sounds familiar, that's not a good sign
[05:39:13] <catbeard> thought about starting up my own RBL
[05:39:28] <e1> catbeard: same... with the shit we get
[05:39:29] <catbeard> with unbound and a python module using redis as a backend
[05:39:53] <e1> catbeard: i'd go into it with you
[05:40:02] <signofzeta> I'll never learn Perl at my age.  But I'm all for it!
[05:40:03] <catbeard> just need deddys
[05:40:11] <catbeard> can't do that shit on vps
[05:40:17] <catbeard> i mean you could but
[05:40:22] <catbeard> UDP

[05:40:58] <signalblue> i can't wait for email over UDP to be a thing
[05:40:58] <e1> whats the backend for it like catbeard 
[05:41:01] <e1> i've never looked into it
[05:41:04] <catbeard> but i could script an AXFR hook based on queryip, and API key as a subdomain
[05:41:19] <signalblue> there's HTTPS over UDP so why not ESMTPS over UDP
[05:41:26] <catbeard> eek
[05:41:31] <catbeard> S-HTTP lol
[05:41:40] <signalblue> lol that's a real thing =
[05:41:47] <signalblue> s/=/
[05:41:48] <layer8> signalblue meant: "lol that's a real thing "
[05:42:00] <signofzeta> we had enough trouble getting SMTP over SSL to be a thing.  Port 465 is still technically reserved.
[05:42:00] <catbeard> actually yes but also QUIC/SPDY
[05:42:12] <catbeard> TLS/SSL over UDP
[05:42:17] <signalblue> signofzeta: the solution there is 587
[05:42:18] <catbeard> e.g. HTTP/3
[05:42:25] <signalblue> because SMTP with SSL is not hard
[05:42:27] <catbeard> 465 you heathen
[05:42:39] <signofzeta> signalblue: not for client-to-server, I meant server-to-server.  STARTTLS is nice enough.
[05:42:45] <signalblue> yeah
[05:43:20] <catbeard> lol every time i get an SFTP chat
[05:43:24] <signofzeta> DANE is wonderful for server-to-server SMTP, but because we don't have DNSSEC yet, we have that kludge called MTA-STS.
[05:43:28] <catbeard> like "ok so i set port 22"
[05:43:29] <signalblue> I just have port 25 open to the WAN

[05:44:54] <catbeard> just set the timeout on that port to really long so it tarpits spammers trying to proxy mail off you
[05:44:56] <signalblue> ya what? should i open the other ports?
[05:44:58] <catbeard> fake banner e.g.
[05:45:09] <signalblue> fail2ban which doesn't fail to ban anything
[05:45:15] <catbeard> then SNI whitelist an actual portforward
[05:45:22] <signofzeta> It fails to ban SMTP.  It works with SSH, though.
[05:45:24] <signalblue> oh and I set the hostname to "MAIL"
[05:45:57] <signalblue> so as to prevent domain disclosure
[05:46:01] <xe0n> very descriptive
[05:46:14] <catbeard> signalblue: on my old systems, outbound smtp(s) was granted by temporary egress firewall rule caused by an auth milter

[05:46:53] <signalblue> also
[05:46:58] <signalblue> SNI for mail? wat
[05:47:06] <signofzeta> on my networks, I just block TCP 25 outbound.  my customers all use Outlook, or access their personal email over TPC 587.
[05:47:09] <signofzeta> *TCP 587.
[05:47:15] <e1> paintful

[05:47:18] <e1> lol..
[05:47:26] <e1> catbeard: oh really
[05:47:34] <catbeard> and that map {} blocks exist in nginx
[05:47:39] <signofzeta> catbeard: i heard that it can.  I don't use that.  I just let it serve my stupid little blog.

[05:48:25] <signofzeta> signalblue: ah, nice.  i'll take another look at fail2ban with email.  perhaps it's doing its job and I haven't noticed.
[05:48:37] <signalblue> those are IP's of people brute forcing this server
[05:48:43] <catbeard> you catch a lot more flies if your edge is running portsentry
[05:48:55] <signalblue> it bans them and then sends me an email with the whois info for the IP
[05:48:55] <catbeard> because then you catch the scanners, and the ips that are using the results of that scanner
[05:49:37] <signalblue> catbeard: that sounds like extra noise

[05:50:36] <catbeard> i don't
[05:50:36] <signalblue> the /s means it's sarcasm or something

[07:03:02] <CableNinja_> mustang takes more because turning the wheel is like trying to roll your mom over

[07:04:36] <CableNinja_> I could probably do it easier in the mustang if I had power steering but with no P/s... fuuuuck
[07:04:42] <e1> Doesn't help that it doesn't actually 'steer' until you turn it like 10 degrees
