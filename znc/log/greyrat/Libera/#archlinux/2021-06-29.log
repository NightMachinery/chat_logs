[03:06:43] <kilobyte22> well, base used to be larger (before it was a metapackage). now it's a "this is the minimum amount of packages thats supported. Don't remove any." - so including anything thats not strictly needed would prevent the user from uninstalling it

[03:08:30] <kilobyte22> a kernel for example isn't strictly required (for example in a container). You can run your computer without any editor. But good luck getting arch to run without systemd :P
[03:08:57] <fireeater> how are you supposed to configure stuff without an editor lmao

[03:14:54] <eggy> I went with systemds' network manager for this build, as it seems to be supported as part of the base without me having to do much else. But I'm not really a fan of systemd's network management. Next build, I'm likely going to go and setup something else to manage it
[03:15:17] <kilobyte22> oh right, systemd-networkd is in fact installed by default

[03:15:52] <kilobyte22> for server usecases it's a pretty solid choice too
[03:16:16] <eggy> I don't like the systemd dns resolver in particular, it seems problematic.
[03:16:17] <kilobyte22> for graphical devices (especially laptops) it can be a bit lacking

[03:18:08] <kilobyte22> you can disable systemd-resolved without disabling systemd-networkd. When installing it should prompt you which to use. Later on it should be as simple as replacing systemd-resolvconf with openresolv (and possibly deleting the symlink at /etc/resolv.conf)
[03:18:16] *** Joins: kulak (~kulak@user/kulak)
[03:19:34] <kilobyte22> i generally avoid resolvd as well, i've had a lot of issues with it in the past (not just on arch)
[03:20:10] <eggy> that is good to know, my problem right now is this systemd unit is giving me dns resolve errors and I have no idea why
[03:20:17] <Jammer> personally prefer to have static nameserver setup, it just works
[03:20:26] <eggy> DNS resolves otherwise.

[03:20:53] *** Joins: derzahl (~derzahl@gateway/tor-sasl/derzahl)
[03:20:55] <kilobyte22> there are sensible cases of using different resolvers, like when logging into company/university/school vpn
[03:21:14] <kilobyte22> often those have split dns, so you cannot see internal domains on public resolvers
[03:21:23] <eggy> my fix has been to edit resolv.conf with static dns servers.
[03:21:36] *** Quits: zarakshR (~Thunderbi@1.39.160.46) (Client Quit)
[03:22:01] <kilobyte22> careful: systemd overwrites that file (or rather, it overwrites a file an /run, which /etc/resolv.conf is symlinked to)
[03:22:20] <kilobyte22> deleting that symlink and then recreating that file should fix that though

[03:23:31] <eggy> in my case, its not linked.. which is likely why things were not working in the first place. Not sure why, so its remained the same.
[03:23:46] <Scimmia> being symlinked by default is a very new thing on Arch
[03:23:59] <eggy> can likely disable systemd-resolved
[03:24:09] <eggy> and I'll likely be fine as is
[03:24:21] <Jammer> yeah don't need that if you have static resolv.conf setup

[03:26:22] <eggy> Well, I just installed this system 3 days ago. If it was linked by default, I'd assume it should have been.. but it doesn't seem to be
[03:26:36] <Foxboron> Scimmia: It was reverted because it was unannounced and broke all our containers
[03:26:52] <Scimmia> yeah, that would do it
[03:26:55] <eggy> either way, I worked through the dns issue I guess =)
[03:27:00] <Foxboron> We need to account for it when setting up devtools stuff and reproducible builds containers :c

[13:19:15] <KillerWasp> Matrix? Really? I guess now any bot is allowed as a bridge. :/
[13:22:15] <KillerWasp> Although in this case, the bot creates multiple sockets to simulate multiple users. Quite intrusive indeed. But it would require extra programming work to manage the connection for each username.

[13:24:13] <KillerWasp> I like the idea. It means that you could bring in multiple users at once instead of just one. They look like authentic users.
[13:25:14] <sukhman> is it some kind of DNS problem
