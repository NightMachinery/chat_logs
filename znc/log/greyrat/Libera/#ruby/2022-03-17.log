[18:47:17] <Tasi> hy guys! I have a question. I was ruby programmer few years ago, but I don't follow the features of the new versions recently. I see, the Ruby introduce the RBS as a file format for type declarations. My question is the following: Can I write my ruby code and the type declarations togeather in common file?
[18:48:00] *** Joins: quintasan (~quassel@quintasan.pl)
[18:48:50] <leah2> afaiu no
[18:50:08] <adam12> Tasi: https://github.com/AaronC81/sord might work, but you're not writing RBS signatures directly at that point, but rather YARD doctags.
[18:52:42] <Tasi> adam12, woow, sounds good

[18:53:42] <wand> adam12 and mooff, thanks for the links. I'll look at queue objects and reactors
[18:54:41] <axisys> how do I change this 'Foo' => 'true', in my rb file to make sure it is true only when stage.equal? not 'beta' ?
[18:54:55] <adam12> wand: I thought you were using threads when I suggested Queue. I still think a proper Queue should be used but mooff was right that it wont' work across processes. There's probably a million solutions to this, but one option is Rinda.
[18:55:44] <adam12> axisys: Can you show more code? Your question isn't clear IMHO.
[18:55:44] <axisys> if not stage.equal? 'beta' 'Foo' => 'true' will work?
[18:58:00] <axisys> adam12: I want to add a logic around this line in rb file https://dpaste.org/jBf5
[18:58:55] <axisys> so set that true only when not stage.equal 'beta'
[19:00:03] <adam12> axisys: And if it's not "beta", then what?
[19:00:57] <axisys> https://dpaste.org/gh5x 
[19:01:32] <axisys> if it is 'beta' set that to false otherwise true

[19:23:23] <axisys> adam12: nice!
[19:24:52] <axisys> adam12: i think this does opposite. I like set to false when beta
[19:25:32] <adam12> axisys: Ahh. (stage != "beta").to_s maybe?
[19:25:50] <adam12> axisys: Unless you _need_ the equal? method call, but I suspect it's the BasicObject method that == calls.
[19:25:58] <axisys> ok, so there is no .notequal , right?
[19:26:52] <adam12> axisys: No
[19:26:54] <axisys> I am not hundred percent, so can we may be use "FOO" => not stage.equal?("beta").to_s 
[19:27:49] <axisys> or like this? "FOO" => (not stage.equal?("beta")).to_s 
[19:28:00] <adam12> Second one likely.
[19:28:05] <adam12> Because of precedence.
[19:28:10] <axisys> adam12: thanks, right
[19:30:12] <axisys> ah.. suggestion is to use simple if else logic
[19:31:03] <adam12> axisys: stage.equal?("beta") ? "false" : "true"
[19:31:19] <adam12> Not really sure what the suggestion is there for?
[19:31:23] <adam12> Anyways, lunch time. Good luck.

[21:05:52] *** Joins: legit (petru@2a03:b0c0:3:f0::60:1000)
[21:06:17] <axisys> I suppose that would be like this for your C style syntax "FOO" => stage.equal?("beta")? "true,": "false," ?
[21:06:23] <axisys> adam12: ^
[21:09:34] <axisys> so I think this should work with ternary stage.equal?("beta") ? "false": "true", with comma at the end. but I still like to convert it to if .. syntax
