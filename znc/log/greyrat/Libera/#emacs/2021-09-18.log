[00:30:56] <benaiah> acdw: that's what has me confused. it doesn't seem like org-mode should be running that hook.
[00:31:21] <acdw> benaiah my guess would be .. you defined the cache and the hook, then you opened an org-mode buffer
[00:32:04] <acdw> and now, since cached-buffer-list doesn't include that one org-mode buffer (since it errored out before it could update the list), it runs every time you open a new buffer now

[00:56:05] <benaiah> bpalmer: it's trying to find the _first_ item in the auto-mode-alist that applies to the buffer name, and stops early once the current major-mode *is no longer* fundamental-mode
[00:56:11] <benaiah> at least that's what's intended
[00:56:59] <benaiah> if the buffer wasn't already in fundamental-mode then it exits before even running the loop (but it does seem that this hook gets called before the major mode is set, so that appears to always be true)

[02:45:15] <puff> I also used to have emacs set up, on a different server which I've lost the .emacs from, to truncate the channel buffer and save it to a log file, automatically.

[02:51:10] <acdw> of course, i .. customize it to be more readable for my needs: https://tildegit.org/acdw/emacs/src/branch/main/init.el#L347
[02:51:51] <puff> I've never had a good experience with customize :-). But I'll take a look.
[02:51:57] <TRS-80> Yeah, I set a custom file now, too.
[02:52:30] <puff> One thing is, for erc I run emacs in a server, via non-GUI mode, so "click on the link" isn't an option.
[02:52:39] <TRS-80> Well, have for a long time, actually.  Ever since aforementioned confusion.  That was what ended the confusion, in fact.  :D
[02:53:25] <acdw> i wasn't reading my custom-file for a while, until just this week -- i'm setting variables in .dir-locals.el and the easiest way to remember what are marked as "safe" i need to load my custom.el
[02:53:45] <puff> Dammit, mode help just says to use mouse-button-1.
[02:53:51] <puff> Er, down-mouse-1.
[02:53:53] <acdw> yeah i'd say setting custom-file is pretty necessary
[02:54:16] <puff> Is there any way to simulate that in text UI mode?
[02:54:50] <acdw> puff: you can also (setq erc-autojoin-channels-alist '(("irc.libera.chat" "#emacs") ("pissnet.de" "#piss")) etc
[02:54:52] <puff> Ah, enter works.
[02:55:03] <puff> acdw: Thanks.
[02:55:18] <acdw> :D
[02:55:30] <acdw> i'm like, 99% sure

[02:56:56] <TRS-80> mort of the time?  :D
[02:57:09] <TRS-80> s/mort/most/
[02:57:35] <puff> Hm: something in this group has been changed outside customize
[02:57:36] <acdw> TRS-80 lol that's just another irc server
[02:57:49] <TRS-80> puff: Do you use C-h v/f much?  You can find a lot through there...
[02:58:00] <acdw> puff: that just means you (setq)'d it or something. you can disregard it :P]
[02:58:17] <acdw> or C-h o too
[02:58:17] <TRS-80> ^ this is exactly the confusion I was referring to eariler
[02:58:37] <TRS-80> puff: set a customize file to avoid that
[02:58:51] <acdw> oh no it'll still show that warning
[02:58:57] <puff> TRS-80: Yeah, I use regular help a lot. Appropos is one of my favorte modes.
