[08:12:02] <cdhowie> 975 minutes seems pretty reasonable to read 60TB of data, calculate parity, and write 12TB
[08:12:17] <cdhowie> especially considering that it throttles resync to avoid starving the system of I/O

[08:15:42] <cdhowie> generally, for large and small drives i recommend btrfs

[08:29:31] <wadedeb> it would be neat to force the system to use more resources for this though because that's all i'm asking to do, there is nothing but kreator and hexchat running in the background 8 cores 3.5ghz 128GB ram i have some resources to burn...
[08:30:09] <wadedeb> back to my query though, at the end of this will I have to do anything to make the system read and writeable in Dolphin, and will it persist through reboots?
[08:31:43] <wadedeb> i run raid 1 at deer/duck camp with everything worth keeping and that is hard to find so i don't mind taking moderate risks with this array
[08:32:34] <wadedeb> am only here to find out the answer to my question above, after that i will have no reason to ask further questions of y'all and instead if i continue to lurk and see queries that are within my wheelhouse i'd be perfectly happy to politely answer instead of being like sney.
[08:33:25] <cdhowie> "no it isn't. there is no data, it's a fresh array." <- doesn't matter
[08:33:33] <cdhowie> mdraid doesn't know about the upper layers
[08:33:36] <wadedeb> neat! i learned a thing thanks
[08:33:54] <wadedeb> i thought it might be faster considering the disks are utterly raw
[08:34:13] <cdhowie> yeah unfortunately it doesn't matter.  it must ensure that the parity blocks are correct.
[08:34:25] <wadedeb> thank you for patiently explaining
[08:34:30] <cdhowie> it will read every single non-parity block to calculate parity
[08:34:54] <wadedeb> besides this debian has come very far it seems in 10 years, last time it was a bitch to get it to work with my hedt hardware
[08:35:01] <cdhowie> but the bigger issue is that since mdraid doesn't know about the upper layers, if a disk dies and you replace it, it must do the same thing again -- read every sector on every other disk to calculate the redundant data on the replacement disk
[08:35:01] <wadedeb> this time it just turned on and worked without any niggles
[08:35:15] <cdhowie> with URE rates being what they are, this is practically guaranteed to fail on a 5*12TB disk array
[08:35:30] <cdhowie> which means your array will likely not survive a disk failure
[08:35:33] <wadedeb> yes, at which point i'll copy from another system or drive 2 hours to deer/duck camp
[08:35:51] <wadedeb> it gets updated via sneakernet
[08:36:08] <wadedeb> bandwidth of a truck with a camper shell full of disks is considerable
[08:36:18] <wadedeb> even better than a station wagon
[08:36:25] <cdhowie> you'd be better off using something like btrfs in raid1 mode, which knows which blocks are in used, meaning you wouldn't have this resync step.  and when you replace a disk it can copy only the data blocks that were on that drive.
[08:36:28] <wadedeb> a one ton van would be optimum though
[08:36:44] <wadedeb> yeah that is a neat feature of btrfs
[08:36:48] <cdhowie> plus it can actually detect which drive has a good copy in the case of corruption.  mdraid cannot.
[08:37:01] <cdhowie> if a bit gets flipped on mdraid you have more or less a 1 in 2 chance of reading the right copy
[08:37:11] <wadedeb> unfortunarely i need the capacity in this volume and can't do any raid 1 modes
[08:37:22] <wadedeb> here capacity and speed trump resilience
[08:37:28] <cdhowie> note btrfs raid1 is not mdraid raid1
[08:37:32] <wadedeb> i know
[08:37:38] <wadedeb> still, i need a few dozen TiB
[08:37:39] <cdhowie> if capacity and speed are important then you want raid0, no?
[08:37:51] <wadedeb> the nic interface is not fast enough to saturate 5 disks raid 0
[08:38:10] *** Quits: ddsys (~ddsys@user/ddsys) (Quit: Leaving)
[08:38:31] <cdhowie> ok.  well, just letting you know -- the initial sync is mandatory so that the automatic monthly scrub doesn't report a myriad of consistency errors.
[08:38:35] <wadedeb> all this system will do is sit and run some game servers off of sata ssds and play movies on plex and kodi to some shield tv boxes
[08:38:40] <wadedeb> thank you kind sir
[08:38:43] <cdhowie> plus the array probably won't survive a single disk failure
[08:38:47] <wadedeb> yes i know
[08:39:11] <wadedeb> you are preaching to choir on this front and i feel like i've adequately explained why i don't care about the failure probability
[08:39:18] <wadedeb> for this array anyway
[08:39:21] <cdhowie> so the fifth drive is a bit of a waste, unfortunately.  a 4 disk raid0 would more or less give you the same resiliency, except the system could continue to operate for a bit after the first disk dies.

[08:43:35] <cdhowie> even without ssd
[08:43:48] <cdhowie> to tell mdraid which blocks are actually in use so it doesn't have to bother syncing unused blocks

[08:44:33] <wadedeb> eg, for fun not business use or anything like that
[08:44:56] <cdhowie> like i said, mdraid doesn't know about the upper layers -- well with trim, there is a mechanism for upper layers to communicate which sectors are unused, which mdraid could theoretically use to skip resyncing them
[08:45:03] <wadedeb> if the array dies that's a good excuse to buy more computer parts/wife convincing factor
[08:45:12] <cdhowie> i imagine someone is probably working on a way to use that information in mdraid
[08:45:53] <wadedeb> you seem to be pretty knowledgable about mdraid though do you know if the debian installer configured mdraid to be writeable, readable, and persist through reboots after this initial resync?
[08:46:01] <cdhowie> i believe mdraid can already relay trims to lower layers, but that's not really the interesting part, and it can actually be counterproductive since it will throw away parity and cause scrubs to report spurious sync errors
[08:46:35] <cdhowie> but if mdraid could remember that information itself, it could even expose trim support when the lower layers don't, just to capture info on which sectors it can ignore
[08:46:47] <cdhowie> the installer should have done everything needed to to persist the array, yes

[10:59:29] <dadinn> I have tried installing firmware-linux-nonfree package but it doesn't seem to have solved it. I am on Bullseye of course.
[11:00:48] <dadinn> I've tried searching for the file amd/amd_sev_fam19h_model0xh.sbin at https://packages.debian.org/index but found no packages which contain that firmware blob

[12:28:53] <frojnd> jelly: correct? Even thoug that's not logical to me. If I'm on buster which is older than bullseye should I use bullseye-backports since bullseye is newe and I need it's backports?

[13:48:50] <jelly> (I have no idea what it's needed for and what fails if it's unavailable, but that's what pipewire is complaining about: Failed to receive portal pid: org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.NameHasNoOwner: Could not get PID of name 'org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop': no such name

[14:53:42] <gour> i'm running xfce and use either (neo)mutt or emacs/notmuch for my email, but wonder which one - evolution or thunderbird) to use (mostly) for syncing calendars/contacs with my baikal server. of course, mailer would serve the needs for other family members, but i'm curious which one would be lighter and/or more appropriate for the xfce desktop?
[14:53:48] <Khepra> wr: it doens't even affect the LEDs, but pixel color, as far as the screen is concern. unless you had OLED but that too wouldn't care how many times it turns on or off, in any reasonable timeframe.
[14:55:07] <wr> Khepra, i was looking again on https://wiki.debian.org/RemoteDesktop https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRemote wish the articles would be a bit more up to date on Debian 11, but on all these solutions, at start x2go or ssh+vnc seems to be best bet for me to remote desktop to my Debian from anywhere on any system i can use

[18:16:10] <ede> flughafen: the tar's are the original ones i think (also see the filename)
[18:16:54] <jelly> flughafen, debian source packages come as two files, orig.tar.gz is original source from upstream, and .debian.tar.gz is everything added by the distro needed to build binary .deb packages
[18:17:14] <jelly> .gz, .xz, whatever the compression du jour
[18:17:37] <ede> fun fact. a .deb is nothing but one of them together with a smaller one with install scripts and a small uncompressed info text file. all glued together to a .ar archive.
[18:17:55] <ede> only isn't there a 4th file nowadays, sometimes at least?

[18:20:41] <ede> yeah
[18:21:39] <jelly> there's control.tar.xz with install scripts and metadata, and data.tar.xz with actual package contents like /bin/ls
[18:22:21] <jelly> all of that is generated during a package build
[18:23:21] <amacater_> If you're really fubarred by something, you can unpack the .deb, move the contol.tar.* to / and untar it - then worry about reinstalling the .deb later to get the metadata proper.

[22:35:56] <dpkg> apt-file is a utility used to find which package owns a given file - or list files in a package - even if it is not installed: "apt install apt-file && apt-file update" ; then "apt-file search filename" to see a list of packages containing filename (can also use a regular expression; see man apt-file).  You can also search online, ask me about <pdo>.  See also <judd-file>, <auto-apt>, <dlocate>.
[22:36:22] <sney> you can also search our channel bots, like
