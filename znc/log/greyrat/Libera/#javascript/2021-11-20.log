[00:47:13] <DPA> Object.entries has to return the whole array from the start. Wrapping that in an iterator doesn't change that. "for in" doesn't have to do that though.
[00:47:43] <DPA> And o[key] is probably O(1)

[10:48:58] <theskillwithin> hard to really tell, don't know what your coworkers make.  but frontend is just as srs as backend esp these days
[10:49:21] <ljharb> i mean sure, i don't exactly know what they make either
[10:49:34] <ljharb> well, i know what every engineer at my level in my company makes, because everyone gets paid the same by level

[16:35:10] <DPA> stenno: In OOP terms, a something object is the instance of a something class, so by talking about a something, we talk about the class. This is why my interpretation of "function object", or a "Functor", is not simply a callable object instance, nor a callable class object.
[16:35:10] <DPA> Instead, a "Functor" is the class whose instance objects (btw. its functor/function objects) are callable. In other words, you can do things like "class someclass extends functor", and you can do things like (new someclass())(), and the functor instances behave as expected of both, an instance of the class, and a callable function.

[23:33:15] *** Quits: comatory (~ondrejsyn@93.99.127.7) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[23:34:19] <qswz> await is just sugar for promises
[23:34:31] <D3mned> thanks qswz
[23:34:41] <qswz> promises use .then(callback)
[23:34:45] <daoudr> silly_:  someone fixed it https://codesandbox.io/s/pensive-elbakyan-4w3bh?file=/src/index.js
[23:34:55] <CoderGuy> qswz, but why would it wait for a timeout to finish?
[23:35:36] <qswz> CoderGuy: becuase the timeout call the resolve callback when it finishes, so the promis gets reslved
[23:35:51] <CoderGuy> what does that even mean
[23:36:06] <CoderGuy> here's the issue I have okay look
[23:36:09] <qswz> new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(() => resolve(), 1000))
[23:36:18] <CoderGuy> await setTimeout();  does not block, why does the Promise make it block?
[23:37:19] <qswz> await setTimeout(1000, v) is setTimeout(1000, v).then(v => {}) which is non blocking
[23:37:41] <qswz> await was added after promises, to make coding easier
[23:38:07] <qswz> but await is indeed sort of blocking the rest of the flow
[23:38:27] <qswz> it's not blocking the event loop
[23:38:48] <qswz> but it awaits for the promises resolve or reject

[23:44:08] <CoderGuy> if you just do await setTimeout(); the code just continues....why does it await a promise resolve though?

[23:50:31] <CoderGuy> so the first example I see EdFletcher is the while(queue.waitForMessage())
[23:50:40] <EdFletcher> setTimeout can and does often resolve slightly after the specified delay because of the event loop (I think that detail is in the setTimeout docs)
[23:51:01] <CoderGuy> yeah i'm not worried about that just, how the promise is able to block
[23:51:11] <qswz> yea, ticks are a few ms
[23:51:17] <CoderGuy> seems like it does it through a loop
[23:51:24] <EdFletcher> CoderGuy: that’s as noted a simplified illustration but the event loop is key to understanding promises. They are blocking YOUR code but not the event loop
[23:51:26] *** Quits: comatory (~ondrejsyn@93.99.127.7) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[23:51:31] <qswz> CoderGuy: v8 or the JS engine tranformthe code
[23:51:33] <systemfault> There's actual event loop lag... and there are fake delays
[23:51:38] <qswz> and it registers timeouts
[23:51:52] <qswz> as systemfault said, the event loop also
[23:52:04] <systemfault> I believe that the browser version of setTimeout has a fake delay of ~5ms
[23:52:07] <silly_> async/await is not really blocking, it's syntactic sugar to classic promises and their .thens
[23:52:37] <qswz> CoderGuy: your question could just be how does a program know it's finished?
[23:52:45] <CoderGuy> well no see here's the issue
[23:52:55] <qswz> like runnign setTimeout(() => console.log('foo'), 1000)
[23:52:59] <EdFletcher> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setTimeout#reasons_for_delays_longer_than_specified
[23:53:07] <qswz> in the same thing
[23:53:17] <CoderGuy> we know that setTimeout() does not block, it just falls through and continues. But somehow a "promise" is able to literally be like "listen don't continue until we call resolve" which to me says while(!resolve){}
[23:53:19] <qswz> the evnt loop knows if everthing is done
[23:53:40] <CoderGuy> okay so an event loop is waiting for this stuff
[23:53:54] <CoderGuy> that makes more sense the code is stuck in the event loop until resolve releases it
[23:53:58] <systemfault> CoderGuy: Promises are just an abstraction on top of normal callbacks.
[23:54:12] <EdFletcher> CoderGuy: I said it and so have others, it’s not actually blocking the entire runtime just your code, the event loop continues processing other events while you await
[23:54:26] <CoderGuy> okay but it does block your code
[23:54:43] <CoderGuy> and so it's all because of the "event loop" that's what monitors it, and the promise communicates with said event loop?
[23:54:43] <systemfault> CoderGuy: Like setTimeout, it takes a callback that is called once the timeout is done... you can't go lower level than that as far as JS is concerned.

[23:55:04] <EdFletcher> CoderGuy, please read that article I sent on the event loop. It will illuminate a lot of this.
[23:55:12] <CoderGuy> so in other words a promise is like wrapping your existing code inside a setTimeout
[23:55:59] <qswz> a promise can be anthing, a http request, ...
[23:56:01] <systemfault> CoderGuy: If you have : async function foo() { const a = await doSomething(); console.log(a); }, the browser executes it as if it was: function foo() { return doSomething().then(a => console.log(a)) }
[23:56:06] <qswz> yea it"s a "wrapper"
[23:56:08] <CoderGuy> I did read the article it didn't exactly answer this
[23:56:10] <qswz> for a future value
[23:56:15] <CoderGuy> okay we agree it's a wrapper okay makes sense now

[23:56:48] <jellobot> (okay) 5 1: 3.56ms
[23:56:49] <CoderGuy> I mean it's a neat trick but it's so weird
[23:57:05] <CoderGuy> and now I get why setTimeout doesn't do jack to stop anything
[23:57:19] <EdFletcher> CoderGuy: also i'd highly recommend just Trying It And Seeing... play around with promises using the traditional syntax (then, catch) and understand how they're working. then add await, which again is just syntactic sugar on promises, and observe the behavior. no better way to learn than to see it in action.
[23:57:58] <systemfault> setTimeout's has a callback that is put on the event loop queue once it timeouts, how it's doing it internally is up to the JS VM
[23:58:32] <systemfault> Could be using OS async facilities... or just a thread with a blocking sleep() call in it, it doesn't matter.
[23:58:39] <CoderGuy> systemfault, yeah but it doesn't block the rest of your code from running, whereas a promise does and that's where i'm like "huh how can a promise do it"
[23:58:57] <qswz> await is just some syntactic sugar
[23:59:02] <systemfault> Promise doesn't block anything, it's still all callbacks under the hood
