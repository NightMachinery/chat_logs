[06:24:07] <morlog> it was made in the 50's

[06:24:40] <morlog> 2 doors on one side
[06:25:08] <FreeRangeDillo> well they built stuff sturdy back then, so who knows
[06:25:20] <FreeRangeDillo> if it's been kept up well
[06:25:34] <morlog> well, I've been in and repaired quite a few trailers
[06:25:56] <morlog> this one needs a new floor it feels like, at least in front of the sink and shower
[06:26:07] <morlog> kind of worn out a bit
[06:26:43] <FreeRangeDillo> maybe they'd trade some of the rent for repair labor and they supply the materials?
[06:27:00] <morlog> yeah
[06:27:10] <morlog> I told them I'd think on it
[06:27:38] <morlog> i dont think they realize just what all needs to be done
[06:27:48] <morlog> I've fixed floors like this before
[06:28:24] <morlog> might be able to just scab it if the water damage doesnt go to farr under the cabinets
[06:28:55] <morlog> i think the trailer is still mostly original inside
[06:29:04] <artao> so get this
[06:29:05] <artao> So I email the landlord about when someone is going to come check out that banging from Saturday and that I've heard no more since then. She gets back to and is like, "If it isnít banging now then not sure what they would be able to find."
[06:29:05] <artao> Um ... If something is broken they can find that and repair it before some catastrophic happens.
[06:29:09] <artao> wtaf
[06:29:18] <artao> "oh, it's not banging anymore. don't worry about it."
[06:29:21] <artao> um ..... no
[06:29:45] <FreeRangeDillo> morlog> i think the trailer is still mostly original inside << appliances?
[06:29:57] <morlog> yeah
[06:29:57] <artao> furnished?
[06:30:19] <FreeRangeDillo>  <artao> "oh, it's not banging anymore. don't worry about it." << give us a call if anything catches on fire lol
[06:30:29] <morlog> appliances, cabinets, gas and electric lighting
[06:30:41] <artao> not fire. roof beams breaking and crashing down thru the ceiling
[06:30:44] <artao> that's my concern
[06:30:49] <morlog> has gas lamps in it
[06:30:57] <morlog> and a gas heater
[06:31:04] <FreeRangeDillo> wow, yeah sounds like a camper for sure
[06:31:05] <artao> if a brace or braces broke the other day then what they were supporting could be slowly coming apart now
[06:31:08] <morlog> no gas though
[06:31:19] <FreeRangeDillo> that'd need one hell of a thorough inspection
[06:31:38] <FreeRangeDillo> artao> if a brace or braces broke the other day then what they were supporting could be slowly coming apart now << speaking of needing inspection
[06:31:41] <morlog> its livable
[06:31:49] <artao> exactly FreeRangeDillo
[06:31:58] <artao> and she's like "oh don't worry about it"
[06:32:04] <artao> i'd think the landlord would be pretty concerned
[06:32:29] <FreeRangeDillo> You could always call the housing code inspection people
[06:32:49] <artao> yeah. not quite to that level yet tho
[06:33:37] <FreeRangeDillo> morlog> its livable << I'm sure you have the knowledge to say yay or nay on its condition
[06:33:46] <artao> got an email from Arturia today ...... 100 bucks to upgrade to V Collection 8, from 6
[06:33:48] <artao> FINALLY
[06:33:53] <artao> been waiting for that offer
[06:34:26] <FreeRangeDillo> Arturia has an impressive collection of virtuals
[06:34:32] <artao> rather
[06:34:41] <artao> i love em
[06:34:54] <artao> i've had v collection since version 4
[06:35:03] <FreeRangeDillo> their controllers look pretty good too
[06:35:15] <artao> again, rather
[06:35:23] <artao> i have three of those too
[06:35:28] <FreeRangeDillo> nice
[06:35:53] <artao> keystep pro, minilab, and spark cdm (purpose-specific for the spark 2 software. hybrid drum machine/sampler)
[06:36:23] <FreeRangeDillo> Just when you were ready to take off, someone offers the possibility of a roof over your head.  Must be very tempting morlog
[06:36:38] <artao> decide with the i ching
[06:36:43] <FreeRangeDillo> haha

[20:06:51] <Panther> My private war here has expanded greatly.
[20:07:55] <Panther> I wish had more space for maps, because the counter density is getting really difficult, although, in general, these larger units didn't attack across much larget frontages.
[20:12:00] <Panther> Soon, there will be about 300,000 troops crammed into a 120 km^2 area.
[20:19:15] <morf> lol
[20:20:31] <morf> Military history can be divided into three periods according to average troop density employed in combat: ancient armies with about 10 square metres per foot soldier, the age of close order formation armed with firearms encompassing the period from the 1650s to the Franco-Prussian War of 1871 that increased the average to 250 square meters per infantryman, and the Second World War when the density decreased to 27,500 square metres per 
[20:20:31] <morf> infantryman.[6] The Soviet Army has based much of its post-war doctrine on the war experience, and had devoted considerable resources to the analysis of troop density, including these in almost all considerations of wartime operations.[7] By the end of the Cold War the density (in Europe) was estimated to be 50,000 square metres per infantryman due to widespread mechanisation of forces.
[20:20:33] <morf> interesting 
[20:21:33] <morf> anyway that doesn't answer my question... i wanted to know which battle had highest troops density 
[20:21:46] <morf> probably something like stalingrad or such 
[20:21:51] <morf> maybe kursk
