[05:47:26] <Guest59> maths is just encoding problems into symbols that can be "proved" or at least tested by other meta-symbols
[05:47:40] <Galois> that's why I put set theory into Coq, to make it objective and unabusable

[05:48:03] <Galois> the propaganda is not about set theory, but the idea that set theory is subjective helps to fuel the propaganda
[05:48:12] <Z-module> buster, okay.  So this A has the form  { H g_t : various g_t in G, t ranging over some index set T }, and then pi^-1 of that is  { h g_t : all h in H, all t in t }  which is nothing but  \cup A

[05:51:15] <Guest59> the real problem with the modern maths curricula is that only small numbers are considered for example even exercises in maths textbooks only use constants (example coefficients of polynomials or rank of a ring) as very small integers. consequently, the theorems that people discover are universally true but "trivial" because they're properties of
[05:51:16] <Guest59> maths objects of finite rank or small rank we can "visualize"
[05:51:56] <Guest59> the solution at least at the university level would be to use something like Conway uparrow notation to solve problems or using some more generic abstraction of raw numbers in problems

[06:53:31] <greenbagels> so at the beginning it's 2, because you just take the starting step to be 2
[06:53:45] <greenbagels> but that removes every even number, so then your sequence is 1,3,5,7,...

[06:54:09] <female_student_4> greenbagels okay yep

[13:07:37] <int-e> Fangs: "remember" is the wrong word for me, I never got far into topology, never mind topological groups
[13:07:40] <Fangs> Z-module: also this reminds me. you said cos(G:H) is an oddway to denote the coset space. I think there's some merit to this. I know that the coset space is defined for any subgroup, but if you read something like "let H be a subgroup and G/H be its coset space..." as part of some long argument, what are the chances that you might accidentally intepret G/H as a group again, as opposed to a mere coset space
[13:09:05] <Fangs> int-e: this actual exercise is surprisingly elementary.. you only need to know two things: definition of continuity of a function, and the quotient topology. say we have q: X -> X/~, if U in X/~ then U is open iff q^{-1} is open
[13:09:26] <Fangs> (its the topology that forces q to be continuous and no more)

[13:13:14] <Fangs> there's some sense that a topological group looks 'the same' everywhere, its obscenely regular

[15:25:32] <buster> Fangs, yeas, you need open and continuous for the topologies to match. Think of the discrete topology on G!
[15:25:36] <rubiksdream> but in general quotient maps need not be open/closed
[15:25:54] <Fangs> I...
[15:25:57] <Fangs> need to prove that
[15:26:15] <Fangs> if N c G is normal then G -> G/N is open
[15:28:09] <Fangs> buster: yeah I did thought of that, or rather indiscrete topology on G/N, then the map G -> (G/N)_{indiscrete} is cts, and ofc you can have it factor through G -> (G/N)_{quotient top} -> (G/N)_{indiscrete} and have it be cts
[15:28:47] <Fangs> its just a bit uncomfortable when you think of "natural" examples in the wild, like R/Z and S^1, a priori this needs not have the topology you think of etc

[16:08:27] <rubiksdream> the X/G comes up very often, normally G is the group of (smooth/holomorphic/continuous) deck transformations of the covering map q : X -> X/G
[16:08:45] <rubiksdream> e.g when Z acts on R, you get the usual covering map R -> R/Z = S^1
[16:08:51] <Fangs> rubiksdream: I love covering spaces, you'd think that I'd know all about it
[16:08:52] <rubiksdream> (or in general R^n -> R^n/Z^n)
[16:09:13] <rubiksdream> covering spaces are nice yeah
[16:09:21] <Fangs> rubiksdream: wouldn't it be nice if that action gives R^n/Z^n ~= S^n
[16:09:29] <rubiksdream> yeah haha
[16:09:34] <rubiksdream> its a shame
[16:09:46] <Fangs> well the homotopy theorists needs a job too
[16:10:12] <buster> poor T^n, nobody likes you
[16:10:42] <Fangs> buster: up to conjugation, there's only one T^n in every Lie group
[16:10:51] <Fangs> maybe compact Lie group there
[16:10:59] <rubiksdream> the only reason i really recall the covering space thing is because im currently using the notion of covering space pretty frequently
[16:11:11] <buster> the maximal torus?
[16:11:22] <Fangs> and you can squeeze a lot by looking at T^n, and G/T^n to study about G itself

[16:17:30] <Fangs> the course name is complex analysis and riemman surfaces
[16:18:26] <rubiksdream> oh i see, for a treatment of both there is the book 'complex analysis' by narasimhan
[16:18:28] <Fangs> oh I think this is the actual book recommended for the course

[16:19:01] <rubiksdream> cool, narasimhan is a really good book
[16:19:03] <buster> ha, no, not the same printing even
[16:19:07] <rubiksdream> very clear, with good exercises
[16:19:19] <Fangs> I dont remember any analysis
[16:19:39] <Fangs> this is going to be rough lol
[16:20:10] <rubiksdream> another classic is ahlfors
[16:20:17] <cadmio> the elements x and h are not necessarily integers
[16:20:27] <rubiksdream> not sure if there is so much treatment of riemann surfaces, but its one of the classics for complex analysis
[16:20:31] <Fangs> I hate ahlfors
[16:20:58] <Fangs> 21:42 <Fangs> cadmio: specifically what's the equivalence relation that makes sense here to say that "x is related to h modulo N"
[16:21:03] <Fangs> N is not an integer here
[16:21:07] <Fangs> N is your normal subgroup
[16:21:33] <Fangs> I hate ahlfors, but I think that might just be because I hate analysis in general
[16:21:47] <Fangs> (everything in analysis is so counter to what you'd do in CS)
[16:22:35] <Fangs> cadmio: for context, people sometimes say G/N is "G mod N"
[16:22:43] <Fangs> or G modulo N
[16:23:14] <rubiksdream> yeah it can be tricky, i think complex analysis is a bit nicer than real analysis though
[16:23:16] <Fangs> 1 = 3 mod 2 gets translated to 1 = 3 mod 2Z (in Z) in this language
[16:23:53] <Fangs> rubiksdream: the only reason I was able to pass was because someone here told me to just do a taylor expansion of everything, and I learnt how to multiply two formal power series in my discrete math class
[16:23:54] <cadmio> ah ok
[16:24:39] <Fangs> with those only two I at least know how to calculate residue (and take some contour with parameter R and regurgitate some magical incantation to say the error goes to 0 as R -> oo)
[16:25:04] <rubiksdream> sounds about right actually, haha
[16:25:23] <Fangs> rubiksdream: I don't understand _AT ALL_ where all the analysis goes
[16:25:39] <rubiksdream> +1 for magical incantation to say the part you want to discard in the integral -> 0 hahaha
[16:26:16] <rubiksdream> to be fair thats roughly speaking what you want to do at first, you want to see if you can integrate on some contour that gives you (what you want) + junk, and pray junk -> 0
[16:26:18] <Fangs> it was a result they showed in lectures, and they make us use it a billion times in HW and classes.. I'm not even convinced my bounds were correct

[16:32:03] <buster> Fangs, cos(ix) = i cosh(x) (up to sqrt(sign errors))
[16:32:18] <rubiksdream> in other words, if you have an entire function, and it is nonconstant, it can omit at most one value

[16:33:32] <Fangs> buster: the mistake is forgetting that if z is complex in cos(z) is no longer bounded
[16:34:05] <rubiksdream> it should have a topological feel, another way to phrase that is that C \setminus {a,b} (for any two distinct points a,b) is hyperbolic

[17:23:58] <CuriousErnestBro> What do you mean?
[17:25:53] <rubiksdream> oh cherim is here, I was going to ask you about this: Let U \subset C be a hyperbolic region (connected open set) (i.e. its universal cover is the unit disk), suppose f : U -> U is holomorphic and fixes two points, show that f is a conformal automorphism
[17:26:03] <rubiksdream> this is basically the schwarz-lemma
[17:26:07] <rubiksdream> but im not sure how to go about it
[17:26:49] <rubiksdream> if I let f(a) = a be one of the fixed points, and set h : D -> U a covering map s.t. h(0) = a, my first instinct is to take f o h and lift it with respect to h, so that I get a map F : D -> D, s.t. F(0) = 0 and f o h = h o F
[17:27:21] <rubiksdream> and then prove that there is some z \in D for which |F(z)| = |z| (and z != 0), using the fact that f(b) = b for some other point b \in U
[17:27:27] <rubiksdream> but im not sure if this really works
[17:28:03] <cherim> The statement looks strange
[17:28:08] <cherim> Where is it from?
[17:28:30] <rubiksdream> a paper of beardon-minda
[17:28:36] <cherim> What page?
[17:28:51] <rubiksdream> you have the pdf I last referenced, right?
[17:29:17] <rubiksdream> page 37 (of the pdf), 45 (of the note), exercise 5
[17:29:41] <rubiksdream> https://www.math.stonybrook.edu/~bishop/classes/math401.F09/Beardon-Minda.pdf
[17:29:44] <rubiksdream> page 37, exercise 5
[17:30:04] <rubiksdream> i dont think the statement is too strange
[17:30:09] <rubiksdream> its essentially the schwarz lemma
[17:30:33] <rubiksdream> the schwarz lemma on the unit disk says a holomorphic map fixing the origin, and s.t. |f(z)| = |z| (z!=0) is a rotation
[17:30:42] <rubiksdream> i.e. a conformal automorphism
[17:30:55] <rubiksdream> so certainly a holomorphic map fixing the origin and another point will be a conformal automorphism
[17:31:08] <rubiksdream> it is just the analog of this fact for an arbitrary hyperbolic region
[17:31:16] <rubiksdream> (a weaker analog)
[17:32:35] <cherim> f preserves metric?
[17:34:02] <cherim> What is the analog of |f(z)|=|z| in your "suppose f : U -> U is holomorphic and fixes two points"?
[17:34:10] *** Joins: qbt (~edun@user/edun)
[17:34:22] <rubiksdream> well if f(z) = z for z!=0, and f(0) = 0, then f is a rotation
[17:34:24] <rubiksdream> this holds on the unit disk
[17:34:59] <cherim> I just read what you write
[17:35:10] <cherim> "Let U \subset C be a hyperbolic region (connected open set) (i.e. its universal cover is the unit disk), suppose f : U -> U is holomorphic and fixes two points"
[17:35:35] <cherim> Can I take U=C and f=z+(z-1)(z-2) which fixes 1 and 2?
[17:35:45] <rubiksdream> no because C is not hyperbolic
[17:35:51] <rubiksdream> its euclidean
[17:36:20] <rubiksdream> its holomorphic covering is itself, not D
[17:37:29] <rubiksdream> anyway, the fact is certainly true for D, let g : D->D fix a and b, and let h : D -> D be an automorphism sending 0->a, then h^{-1} o g o h fixes 0 and h^{-1}(b), and is thus a rotation, thus g is an automorphism
[17:37:44] <rubiksdream> the whole point is via lifting, we should be able to use that this is true for D, and prove it for any hyperbolic region

[17:45:43] <cherim> What's the problem if your U is not some unknown genus surface but just a subset of C?
[17:46:00] <cherim> Can't you just identify it with D via uniformization?
[17:46:16] <cherim> Without appealing to universal covers
[17:47:00] <rubiksdream> you could if it was simply connected
[17:47:05] <rubiksdream> but multiply connected domains make it a probelm
[17:47:20] <rubiksdream> then one can only say D is cover
[17:47:36] <rubiksdream> (and cover is local isometry, rather than isometry in case of simply connected region)
[17:49:11] <rubiksdream> simple example is a punctured disk
[17:49:32] <cherim> Yes, it's enough to say you really meant connected and not simply connected

[17:57:39] <rubiksdream> but i cant be sure it fixes another point
[17:57:55] <rubiksdream> in fact it might not, but what I need to show is that map D ->D is an automorphism
[17:58:19] <rubiksdream> i.e. a rotation, somehow, using the fact that the ground map U -> U fixes another point besides a
[17:58:24] <Z-module> Does automorphism here just mean a holomorphic bijection with holomorphic inverse?
[17:58:27] <rubiksdream> (once i have its a rotatino i can conclude)

[19:44:44] <rubiksdream> probably a silly question, but if p_1,p_2 are two metrics on some open connected set in C, and p_1 < p_2 at all points of the open connected set, is the associated distance d_{p_1} strictly less than the associated distance d_{p_2}?

[19:53:20] <rubiksdream> for example when p(x,y) = |(x,y)| then you get the usual euclidean distance

[19:56:11] <somiaj> It almost sounds like you are talking about a norm
[19:56:34] <somiaj> though I guess a norm has additonal properities, and distance is just defined as d(a,b) = || a - b ||
[19:56:40] <somiaj> well p(a-b)
[19:56:49] <rubiksdream> maybe, but it can be pretty far away from a norm
[19:56:57] <rubiksdream> its any smooth enough scalar field
[19:57:01] <somiaj> yea, if it is just a non-negative map, it doesn't have to be a norm.
[19:58:22] <somiaj> well if a < b then int_0^1 a dt < int_0^1 b dt, so your claim would hold since |gamma'(t)| p_1(gamma(t)) < |gamma'(t)| p_2(gamma(t))

[20:04:10] <somiaj> or you could see if adding a continunity restriction to p_1 and p_2 help. I wonder if continuity is enough to show that there is a path that takes on the infinum value, thus it is actually a minimum value. And if so then it would follow.

[20:09:35] <rubiksdream> p could be something really simple like the euclidean metric (x,y) -> 1, and there might not be a shortest path
[20:10:01] <rubiksdream> for instance take a punctured disk, and take two points radially opposite each other across the puncture
[20:10:11] <rubiksdream> the shortest path is certainly the straight line path, but its not in the domain
[20:10:18] <rubiksdream> so any other C^1 path is not going to be as short
[20:11:44] <rubiksdream> for sure there is a sequence of paths tending to that
[20:11:48] <rubiksdream> maybe that can be used somehow
[20:12:12] <somiaj> ahh yea, I guess you could try to create a counter example to show that you don't have enough conditions to ensure the distance is strictly smaller
[20:12:22] <somiaj> any reason you need < instead of just <= in the final distance comparision?

[22:42:03] <loopspace> ~50 billion groups of order 2^10
[22:42:40] <Z-module> loopspace, you know that essentially all finite groups are 2-groups, right?
[22:42:54] <loopspace> Nice
[22:43:15] <Z-module> That is:   lim_{n=1,2,...} (# of 2-groups of order <= n)/(# of groups of order <= n) = 1
[22:43:34] <loopspace> The term injective had not yet been coined when R. Baer, who introduced the notion of injective module, proved this result. After recognizing that injective groups are duals of free groups, he jokingly called such groups fascist groups, and he was delighted to have proved that they are trivial.

[23:01:30] <Z-module> indeed
[23:01:34] <Z-module> you're almost there now
[23:02:03] <Z-module> so our f amounts to a "functional square root of inversion"
[23:10:51] <hanif> rubiksdream: i have little group theory knowledge, but what does (Z,+)^{(+)N} mean? i get (Z,+), but that exponent confuses me
[23:11:11] <rubiksdream> direct product countably many times
[23:11:23] <rubiksdream> (x_0,x_1,...) x_i \in Z, all but finitely many of the x_j are zero
[23:12:05] <hanif> gotcha
[23:12:27] <Z-module> it's =~ the additive group of the ring Z[x]
[23:12:34] <rubiksdream> okay, so let {p_1,p_2,...} be an enumeration of the primes, define a map f : Q_{>0} -> Z^{(+)N} by f(p_j) = 1_j (its determined by this). Now we do the translated problem, define the map as follows
[23:12:37] <tusko> What is a 'variety'?
[23:13:07] <Z-module> (actually "direct sum", or "weak direct product")
[23:13:42] <rubiksdream> the map is determined by phi(1_{2j}) = -1_{2j+1} and phi(1_{2j+1}) = 1_{2j} for all j=0,1,...
[23:13:54] <Z-module> right

[23:16:25] <Z-module> My favorite pretty way to express all this is: since the countable direct sum of copies of Z is also the countable direct sum of copies of Z x Z, by identifying an integer pair (m,n) with  m + in,  our group here is nothing but the additive group of the ring (Z[i])[x]  -- polys with Gaussian integer coefficients. Now we can just put f(p(x)) = i p(x) -- multiply each coefficient by i.  This is exactly the 90-degree rotation mornfall was
[23:16:25] <Z-module> looking for up there.
[23:17:10] <rubiksdream> so putting this together, the map we want is f^{-1} o phi o f, which is determined by p_{2j} -> 1/p_{2j+1} , and p_{2j+1} -> p_{2j}, where {p_1,p_2,...} is an enumeration of the primes
[23:18:31] <Z-module> yes, you have the same map as I do, put back into the original Q^+ terms

[23:21:21] <rubiksdream> in principle we are trying to shoehorn i^2 = -1 into this
[23:21:32] <rubiksdream> but it has the benefit of being geometric, sure
[23:22:06] <Z-module> Inline: this ring Z[i] turns out to furnish very nice economical proofs of such class things as Lagrange's 4-square theorem
[23:22:18] <Z-module> classic*
[23:22:42] <Z-module> and Fermat's 2-square theorem
[23:22:58] <Inline> hmmm
[23:23:18] <rubiksdream> was this problem from a particular source?
[23:23:34] <Inline> welp, i'm reading up on concepts of force and history of mechanics, i think i'll get there somewhile
[23:23:42] <Inline> heh
[23:23:53] <rubiksdream> try not to think of it as above concepts of force/history of math
[23:23:58] <Z-module> rubiksdream: I can't remember it now
