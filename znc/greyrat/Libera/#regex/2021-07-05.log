[01:40:40] <Release_> i was curious if this regex could exclude if "guest" is in it ?
[01:40:41] <Release_> https://regex101.com/r/Ll4bVL/1
[01:41:10] <Release_> i believe SKIP could do that only not sure how to go about
[02:00:53] <Release_> basically what we seek is any word with more than 2 digits in it wether mixed or next to eachother to detect and exempt if a string has "guest" in it
[02:11:15] <Release_> tried (?i)guest(*SKIP)(*F)|\d{3,}
[02:11:36] <Release_> but didnt seem to be proper
[02:27:42] <Release_> this seems to work /(?i)guest.*(*SKIP)(*F)|\d{3,}/ but it doesnt detect if its mixed chars like jh1h7jk2jh1jk7

[21:01:57] <JohnDoe2> digitok surprised it worked!
[21:08:47] <digitok> luckily for you, it doesn't take much
[21:10:24] <JohnDoe2> 😆
[21:10:41] <digitok> have you used malwarebytes windows firewall control, jd2
[21:11:12] <digitok> seems similar to the one you mentioned, but a bit more minimal
[21:11:13] <JohnDoe2> no, esset has a similar thing, and so does zonealarm but WFN is open source.
[21:11:42] <JohnDoe2> the idea is to catch software as they're trying to make an outgoing connection - if you think that should happen, allow it, otherwise block the sucker.
[21:12:21] <JohnDoe2> incredibly useful. All this software that claims "we care about your privacy" and I end up blocking all kinds of analytics 
[21:13:02] <digitok> yea, i've used the mb one, but i don't use anything atm
[21:13:08] <JohnDoe2> and of course, the classic unchecking "check for updates" but the software still calls home :P 
[21:13:47] <JohnDoe2> windows itself does some major snooping, but so does macOS. Some of it you can block without breaking functionality...
[21:14:22] <digitok> yea, i have a bunch of stuff disabled using shutup10
[21:15:59] <testuser[m]> Doesn't shutup10 itself have telemetry
[21:16:23] <digitok> no idea lol
[21:16:28] <JohnDoe2> that's generally going to be disabled services and hosts entries, but windows has the svchost.exe that routes a bunch of network traffic making it very difficult to track what is using it to connect to the interneps.
[21:16:59] <JohnDoe2> macOS has other similar services that route network traffic from any app
[21:17:21] <JohnDoe2> and then there's purely circumventing your hosts, your preferences, everything, and going straight for a DNS server of their choice
[21:17:44] <JohnDoe2> what I'm saying is: shutup10 is almost a decent way to block some of the telemetry.
[21:18:36] <JohnDoe2> https://bugout.regex.ga/eb516e5a4363dcd82e6c00ab6cf03b68_dns-level.png
[21:18:40] <digitok> seems like a good compromise :p
[21:18:54] <JohnDoe2> https://bugout.regex.ga/19035cdbe215dd20fd463b01a20b80a9_dns-level-top-10.png
[21:19:45] <JohnDoe2> #2 on the top 10 most blocked domains is this asshat software called 1Password. Doesn't get the point. 
[21:20:20] <digitok> lol
[21:20:27] <JohnDoe2> also my router's FW rules do not allow intranet IPs to query port 53 or 5353 of another IP other than my own DNS server.
[21:20:41] <JohnDoe2> So windows can bypass the crap out of my hosts file all it wants. Still can't get anywhere

[23:01:56] <JohnDoe2> n00bN3rd probably need to figure out the copy paste thing :D
[23:02:16] <n00bN3rd> oh dear..... </SHAME SHAME ON IT'S WAY>
[23:02:53] <n00bN3rd> aaaaaah, you lost the \s after the \:
[23:03:07] <JohnDoe2> I didn't it's still there
[23:03:11] <JohnDoe2> and : is not a special character 
[23:03:20] <karhunkynsii> He lost the space in the data too.
[23:03:44] <JohnDoe2> what are you trying to pull out? memyselfi ? (from SEPA Overboeking IBAN: DE97TRIO0601265757 BIC: TRIONL2A Naam: memyselfi Omschrijving: Prive opname )
[23:03:57] <karhunkynsii> Yes.
[23:04:08] <JohnDoe2> 👀
[23:04:10] <digitok> she said
[23:04:20] <n00bN3rd> but it still doesn't work haha
[23:04:25] <JohnDoe2> n00bN3rd why not go for "Naam:" then?
[23:04:30] <n00bN3rd> probably US versus NL file settings
[23:04:31] <JohnDoe2> doesn't that mean "name" ?
[23:05:03] <JohnDoe2> don't think cells on google sheets inherit your \r\n but I could be wrong
[23:05:03] <n00bN3rd> yes
[23:05:10] <n00bN3rd> but you pronouince it naam hahah
[23:05:11] <n00bN3rd> ;-\
[23:05:15] <n00bN3rd> bad joke.. I know
[23:05:28] <karhunkynsii> I like it.

[23:07:13] <JohnDoe2> n00bN3rd now since you're really good at the appscript stuff, how do I append to a google sheet document on a specific sheet?
[23:07:26] <n00bN3rd> IT. IS.JUST. NOT WILLING TO DO IT! I'm going on a rampage..
[23:07:45] <karhunkynsii> Does anything work?
[23:08:06] <n00bN3rd> well, stupid thing is that my other g-shit is working
[23:08:10] <n00bN3rd> let me check settings

[23:08:44] <JohnDoe2> n00bN3rd the only way this isn't going to work is if your string looks nothing like what you pasted above
[23:08:57] <n00bN3rd> yeah... I give up. Anotyher day tomorrow
[23:09:06] <n00bN3rd> Thanks for you help guys!
[23:09:13] <JohnDoe2> 🤔

[23:11:00] <JohnDoe2> "This affects formatting details such as functions, dates, and currency."
[23:11:02] <n00bN3rd> so probably a difference between " or ' etc
[23:11:10] <JohnDoe2> don't buy it
[23:11:17] <n00bN3rd> in gogle data studio you have to use \\s in stead of \s
[23:12:03] <JohnDoe2> so copy paste fail?
[23:12:11] <n00bN3rd> I don't get it either, literally pasted your code. Changed settings, removed white space, put it back and woopsy[ daisy.. tere it was
[23:12:22] <JohnDoe2> I just switched locale to a bunch of settings including norway and sweden
[23:12:30] <JohnDoe2> ah-hah! removed white space, put it back
[23:12:36] <JohnDoe2> that's the step that matters
[23:13:07] <n00bN3rd> could be ;-)
[23:13:11] <JohnDoe2> =REGEXEXTRACT(A1;"Naam:\s+(\S+)")
[23:13:15] <JohnDoe2> 100% 
[23:13:44] <JohnDoe2> locale has nothing to do with it, and as far as google data studio whatever that is requiring different escaping I have no clue
[23:13:54] <n00bN3rd> thanks, got it to work. Much appreciatyed!
[23:13:55] <JohnDoe2> in sheets it works just fine with \s and \S
[23:14:09] <n00bN3rd> try data studio... you'll get furious haha

[23:34:14] <JohnDoe2> \1 might be $1 not sure
[23:34:53] <JohnDoe2> actually the first one might not be good, I'd replace .+ with [^.]+
[23:36:19] <mehwork> thanks
[23:38:26] <mehwork> so if i wanted to only do it for lines starting with 'blah:', it would be: s/(blah:)(.+)\..+/\1\2foo/m  ?
[23:38:30] <mehwork> seems to work
