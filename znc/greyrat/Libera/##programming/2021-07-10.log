[00:20:42] <pyzozord> Izem: It's completly not supported by anything but I have a feeling that all those sophisticated optimizer can be beat by a experienced programmer with sharp language who is mindful of data locality and vectorization
[00:21:12] <Izem> sure, but how many people know x86 that well anymore?
[00:21:38] <Izem> plus, I hate reading clever code like that :P
[00:21:53] <pyzozord> well yeah that's are good arguments

[00:22:57] <Izem> I didn't think it was possible to read all of those manuals
[00:23:38] <Izem> but I've gotta try something
[00:23:50] <Izem> x86 is inevitable lol
[00:24:45] <pyzozord> intel manuals are not a joke, for sure...
[00:24:53] <pyzozord> But I should read at least most of the volume 1
[00:24:58] <GeDaMo> You don't have to memorize them :P
[00:25:30] <GeDaMo> Also I like this as an instruction quick reference https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/index.html
[00:25:32] <pyzozord> I've checked out few instruction references in it few times and I could actually understand it
[00:25:59] <pyzozord> oh nice, yeah that seems much faster to search then doing a text search in 5k pages pdfs

[00:32:22] <misnor> C/C++ Question - totally exhausted my google-fu here. I am trying to get a some code to run every 1 second in a non-blocking way. Original code is based off of the first part of this answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/10807811 . However, in practice (https://bpa.st/23DQ) I am seeing that the timer is triggering every *10 seconds* - if i divide CLOCKS_PER_SEC by 10, it runs as expected! Why?
[00:32:49] <misnor> "timer" is likely not the right word to use here
[00:34:36] <vdamewood> misnor: To start, is it C or C++, pick one.
[00:34:42] <misnor> C++.

[00:36:38] <misnor> entirely because the original code i referenced was doing it.

[00:40:16] <GeDaMo> I would make both playerMoveTimeInSeconds and time_counter into clock_ts and remove all the double conversions
[00:41:28] <InPhase> (time_counter / CLOCKS_PER_SEC > playerMoveTimeInSeconds) would also avoid rollover issues.

[00:42:39] <InPhase> And still work with GeDaMo's clock_t suggestions.
[00:45:03] <misnor> switching them over to clock_t definitely looks cleaner (thank you), however, it is still behaving the same. if condition is triggered every 10 seconds. While walking through the debugger the value of CLOCKS_PER_SEC is 1,000,000 - time_counter is incrementing very slowly when compared to the number it needs to hit.

[00:54:17] <vdamewood> Oh, and this_thread.sleep()

[00:57:24] <pyzozord> misnor: I'm using clock_gettime to get time, and poll for taking input from stdin without blocking

[07:32:04] <berndj> ayenet4, yeah, because grep tells me where something happens to be defined, but does not say which header i *should* include. the difference between "it happens to work" and "the right way to make it work"
[07:33:05] <berndj> ayenet4, many things end up being actually defined in headers like <linux/foo.h> or <bits/bar.h>, but those aren't headers one should be directly including
[07:36:42] <ayenet4> the manual usually tells you which file to include for those
[07:37:43] <berndj> the man pages specify headers for functions, but they rarely specify which headers define the types
[07:38:50] <berndj> specific example: i'm looking for the definition of struct iovec; now <sys/uio.h> is specified as providing prototypes for readv and writev, but it doesn't expressly state that that's the minimal header to just get at struct iovec

[09:16:44] <W> alright I guess I'll give it a go just to see what the state of things is *downloads android studio*
[09:17:13] <jeaye> Should be really easy. You don't even need a device, W. Both iOS and Android have simulators to use.
[09:18:02] <jeaye> The default Android emulator is pretty darn slow for any graphical things, but tools like GenyMotion are much better.
[09:18:20] <jeaye> GenyMotion is free for personal use, last I checked.
[09:18:20] <W> sure but if the phone bits are fiddly, that matters too, even if "just use the simulator" works for immediate development
[09:19:53] <W> specifically, if you want to alpha test things in the wild, such as practically walking around gathering GPS data in your local neighbourhood with all its inaccuracies and coverage problems, no sim will do
[09:26:14] *** Joins: roent (~roent@user/roent)

[09:29:38] <Guest594> jeaye you can easily simulate a sim

[09:35:36] <W> well that matters too - can you say "I want maximum compatibility at the cost of API features" easily?

As an example of how things used to be, some Android devices would not ship an accessible webview control, so you had to bundle it in yourself - though I think those days should be behind us now.

[10:31:25] <amigojapan> vdamewood: I like his modern movies. Not much of a fan of samurai movies
[10:31:54] <W> okay, first hickup: apparently the emulator does not work on AMD CPU without additional work (manual patching)

[10:33:12] <vdamewood> W Oh, yeah, Intel has a special VM mode that they take advantage of for the simulator.
[10:33:27] <vdamewood> The Android simulator is literally Qemu.

[10:43:04] <vdamewood> Oh, that makes sense.
[10:43:29] <amigojapan> vdamewood: I don't want to use Java at all
[10:43:53] <vdamewood> amigojapan: Make a JNI function to handle the on-sleep signal, then just call the JNI function in your Java handler.
[10:43:58] <arahael> amigojapan: Have you considered Kotlin?
[10:44:40] <amigojapan> arahael: I wanted to use Qt for everything
[10:45:04] <arahael> amigojapan: Fair enough.
[10:45:07] <amigojapan> Qt is actually pretty easy to use
[10:45:24] <amigojapan> Quick controls is like VB
[10:45:30] <arahael> Actually that's my biggest worry when using a different language on the mobile platforms: You often end up needing to know both languages.
[10:45:52] <arahael> Which isn't that big a deal, imho, but it makes it more complex when looking for people to hire, and makes the project more complicated.

[10:48:49] <vdamewood> Not that I now of, but I havent looked.
[10:48:57] <amigojapan> Ok
[10:49:26] <arahael> amigojapan: I personally wouldn't recommend python for android apps, but you could "just" embed the interpreter.
[10:50:15] <amigojapan> vdamewood: there is an ide that lets you make apps in python for Android. Only problem is I don't think they offer any way to make stand alone apps
[10:51:11] <amigojapan> arahael: I don't want anything to do with Java. And best of all develop on Android ideally

[10:52:29] <W> not only is android java not java, just almost java, non-java languages on android are almost java too
[10:53:15] <amigojapan> arahael: what about dart?
[10:53:15] <arahael> W: Yes, there is that - I guess it depends on why, exactly, amigojapan doesn't want Java.

[11:03:06] <arahael> W: I've not used it, but it's looking really promising.
[11:03:51] <arahael> Actually this seems to be a good page describing how the two platforms are moving: https://emmanuelkehinde.io/so-far-so-good-swiftui-vs-jetpack-compose/
[11:04:47] <arahael> Having that "preview" there is seriously amazing in terms of productivity.
[11:05:22] <W> the visual editor in android studio is immediately confusing. There's no toolbar of components to add, no right-click "Add button..." or similar options
[11:05:35] <W> I guess the expectation is that it's just a preview, and you edit the XML?
[11:07:57] <arahael> From memory, several years ago, yes. It's driven by the XML.
[11:08:11] <arahael> In SwiftUI, it's driven from either side - either the preview or the code.

[12:15:51] <vdamewood> Yeah, when they announced the iPhone they said it runs 'OSX underneath', so they're not really pushing 'Unix' on the mobile devices.
[12:16:50] <vdamewood> But I remember when macOS was announced they were all like "Unix" this, and "Unix' that, and release notes said things like "Userland updated to FreeBSD 5.x" and such.

[12:19:54] <deniska> vdamewood: in mid-late 199x "unix" was a synonim for "big and important computers with big uptimes for people doing interesting computer stuff"

[14:33:15] <mrig> oh simply a lucid explanation of slope intercept form, as far as I'm aware I've never been taught this before. Of course you can know it intuitively by fumbling about but having it highlighted is somewhat more efficient.
[14:34:51] <mrig> even the notion of 'slope' I mean obviously this is dy/dx but, to see that this is just the coefficient of x in an equation put into this form makes it much easier to reason about.
[14:35:10] <pikapika> mrig, lines are funny
[14:35:19] <pikapika> I prefer ax+by+c or x/a + y/b = 1

[19:25:58] <sandman13> mrig: What's happening is this: Python client sends message to Go server. I see message that is read from client on server end but client doesn't exit at all.
[19:26:40] <mrig> sandman13: so it is not being terminated, right that should be easy to solve.
[19:27:20] <sandman13> I asked this on #python and the answer I received was: server should close() the socket for client to exit
[19:27:56] <sandman13> On server end, I want to read everything that client sends and then close it. But despite all the efforts, I am failing
[19:28:09] <mrig> sandman13: your continue there will never be reached as the log.Fatal calls os.Exit()
[19:28:19] <mawk> if it's tcp there is no "everything the client sends and then close"
[19:28:33] <mawk> you have to have some mechanism in your own protocol to detect that the client sent everything it should have sent
[19:28:44] <mawk> for instance having fixed message sizes
[19:28:48] <mrig> sandman13: and you should be checking for all errors, when it is not an io.EOF too.
[19:28:55] <sandman13> mawk: It's Unix socket
[19:29:02] <mawk> unix socket can be tcp-like
[19:29:06] <mawk> if it's a stream socket

[19:29:41] <mrig> tcp is pretty simple with this lib.
[19:29:49] <sandman13> where 64KiB messages are common
[19:29:59] <sandman13> omuxsock of rsyslog :)
[19:30:17] <sandman13> that is whatever syslog message rsyslog receives will be passed to this server
[19:30:24] <mawk> you can make 64KiB messages if you want then, and close the client socket when you receive that amount
[19:30:30] <mawk> but it's not very efficient
[19:30:48] <chance> distilled: unless you're using a specific protocol that terminates messages for you, no matter what protocol or connection type you're using, you will have to terminate messages yourself, whether ^ or with a fixed terminator byte/char/etc or something clever.

[19:31:26] <mrig> oh the error is check but is a little awkward.
[19:31:32] <mawk> you can also just wait on the client to close the socket himself sandman13

[19:33:20] <hjf> and he tells me "i've been here for 3 weeks too and i already pushed 2 fixes to prod "

[19:33:47] <mawk> it's probably nothing personal
[19:34:24] <mawk> sandman13: so what is the exact condition that should make the client exit in your protocol?
[19:35:40] <sandman13> flow I envisioned was this: client sends data, server receives all data, server closes the connection, client exits
[19:35:58] <sandman13> but I think I am on wrong tracks here.
[19:36:22] <mawk> you can send the message from client side and start shutdown immediately after all data has been sent, I thin
[19:36:24] <chance> sandman13, mawk: you're awaiting the writer you just closed to close again. did you mean to await a clean disconnect from the reader? i agree you're on the wrong track, that's just something i noticed
[19:36:25] <mawk> k
[19:37:01] <sandman13> chance: Hmm.
[19:37:06] <alycidyne> Back to brainstorming time: what about "everything is a memory segment" vs. "everything is a stream of bytes"?
[19:37:06] <chance> there are plenty of clean workflows. shutdown immediately after all data is send, that's good. since your network layer isn't verifying anything, you could wait for an OK from the server first
[19:37:15] <alycidyne> i.e. all files are just linker input

[19:41:04] <chance> it's worth noting that RYO with unix sockets is the roughest angle, imo. in python, at least, the various async network libs have all the right sugar, but they're gonna get you HTTP/S, raw TCP, UDP, WS/S. basically everything but unix sockets. there's probably a half-decent sugary unixy lib, too, but i've never cared. i've also never seen the go

[19:47:20] <chance> that's what i'm implying ;)  asyncio works the same whether or not you roll your own server-client model. but if you've got a particular reason to choose unix sockets, there's not a lot you can do about that

[22:58:40] <woggle> (Well, already saved or, in the case of SYSCALL, deliberately omitted registers.)
[22:58:46] <berndj> by the time the "fake" PUSHA happens, bx and bp aren't saved yet
[22:58:56] <berndj> ok, i guess deliberately omitted then
[22:59:09] <berndj> and then retconned back onto the stack

[22:59:32] <woggle> Yeah, that's a better way of describing it.
[23:00:17] <woggle> Now, I'm not saying this was a good choice by the Linux kernel people (especially since they apparently decided at some point to not actually use the PUSH instruction), but it's explainable.
[23:01:31] <berndj> i'm guessing PUSH turned out to be slower than moving the stack frame once and then MOVing registers into the frame with offsets
