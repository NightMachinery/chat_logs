[00:10:13] <Guest13> Hey guys, why (read-string "09" returns error but (read-string "01") works?
[00:10:15] <Guest13> Thanks
[00:12:16] <ridcully_> Guest13: prefixing a zero to number makes that read like an octal number
[00:12:47] <Guest13> Oh I see, thanks! so how can I convert "09" to 9?
[00:14:09] <ridcully_> Integer/parseInt will do that
[00:14:57] <Guest13> Thanks!
[00:15:16] <Guest13> I'm new to Clojure, isn't it "bad practice" to use the Java interop functions?
[00:15:27] <ridcully_> in general: read-string is a bad thing for untrusted input
[00:16:27] <ridcully_> why would that be a bad practise?  one of the main reasons clojure is also on the jvm is the ecosystem
[00:17:41] <Guest13> I think I read it somewhere.. probably I'm wrong
[00:17:49] <Guest13> Thanks again :)
[00:18:42] <ridcully_> read-string is way worse here (as it allows code execution)
[00:19:03] <Guest13> read-string uses eval? good to know that
[00:19:29] <ridcully_> you can turn that off, but it's on by default.  usually the edn/read-string is what you want to read data
[00:20:54] <Guest13> I'm solving project euler problems to learn Cloujre and needed a way to read this triangle (https://projecteuler.net/problem=18) 
[00:21:36] <Guest13> I ended up with: https://pastebin.pl/view/e6de3337
[00:26:08] <ridcully_> this btw is one downside - the java functions are not really first class functions.  so sadly you can not just write (map Integer/parseInt ...)
[00:30:20] <technomancy> it's real bad!!
[00:30:56] <technomancy> like ... amazingly misguided to hide a time-bomb in a innocent-looking core function like that
[00:32:53] <technomancy> it's like if your car gearshift would sometimes make the engine explode and if you wanted the non-exploding gear shifting mechanism you had to look in the glove compartment

[00:46:55] <Guest13> yeah.. I don't like this "parseInt is not a static function" error either :\
[00:48:36] <shem> well...most languages have quirks. untyped lambda calculus maybe fewer than most
[00:57:15] <shem> language-level quirks rarely can be mended. they'll be worked around
[01:02:28] <technomancy> most quirks don't result in RCE
[01:08:29] <shem> you had me there if it's so.

[21:14:56] <andreyorst> watching old Clojure vids I've noticed that Rich talked about arbitrary precision math, and that it's a great feature to have in the language, and he shows some code that uses regular plus sign. But now it is +' that does arbitrary precision addition. Does anobody know why has this been changed?
[21:16:29] <Para> Yep, it got changed.
[21:16:41] <technomancy> I think he got tired of people publishing naive benchmarks that were comparing Clojure's arbitrary-precision math with other languages fast math because they didn't bother to understand what they were doing.

[21:26:15] <andreyorst> interesting
[21:27:15] <andreyorst> it's a bit of a shame tho
[21:27:24] <technomancy> agreed
[21:27:42] <technomancy> you should get correct results by default and opt-in to sacrificing correctness for speed
[21:28:06] <technomancy> unfortunately you can't get people to understand that when they're publishing blog posts that are trying to get to the top of hacker news
[21:51:32] <sobel> agreed, though i think that's part of why i like clojure/clojure community. they've made and championed a lot of design ideas that stack up benefits way faster than drawbacks, and i think it takes some experience in failure-mode to recognize a good collection of solutions
[21:52:21] <sobel> i guess it's just a sign of industry boom that people in our trade are writing and accepting shallow analysis
[21:53:05] <sobel> that said, i will keep siding with critics who can't read a clojure stack trace, either :)
