[21:00:02] <node1> Hi
[21:00:07] <node1> Hello all.
[21:00:10] <node1>  i would like to make a graph which has the options in bottom or top to generate a image for hours, days and week. something like this https://www.loriotpro.com/Products/On-line_Documentation_V5/LoriotProDoc_EN/V22-RRD_Collector_RRD_Manager/V22-J10_RRD_Collector_Ping_EN.htm
[21:00:29] <node1> How to make such click options?
[21:01:00] *** Quits: jonifen (~jonifen@user/jonifen) (Quit: Leaving)
[21:15:20] <entuland> definitely not something you can do with pure HTML, you need either some server side code to generate the image and serve it, or you need to paint the image on a canvas with JS on the client side - there are other approaches likely
[21:16:20] <entuland> such as html2canvas (but that counts as doing it with JS, the difference is that you can leverage on the library without implementing your own code to do that)
[21:17:00] <entuland> oh, I see the crossposting on #javascript
[21:18:38] <node1> entuland, My main goal is to have hyperlink with name [ hours, day, week ]. When a user click on it, it will send query or whatever to execute my bash script to generate image[report]. And there is already a pice of javascript code which loads the image.
[21:18:56] <stenno> offtopic in #html
[21:18:58] <node1> is it possible?
[21:19:14] <stenno> i think
[21:19:22] <entuland> yep, please send your queries to the fitting channels and avoid crossposting
[21:19:51] <entuland> there are more generic channels where you can post your query if you're not sure about which technology / language to use exactly yet
[21:21:34] <node1> I'm only asking here and javascript channel.
[21:22:38] <entuland> you posted the same question in both channels at the same time without waiting for any feedback, that's crossposting and that's normally a bad ide
[21:22:42] <entuland> idea*
[21:23:06] <entuland> since most of the discussion happened there already, you can continue there
