[13:36:40] <gevaerts> I just looked at a random terminal window to see that my laptop happens to be compiling curl :)
[13:37:00] <gevaerts> (doing some embedded yocto work right now)
[13:45:12] <bagder> \o/
[13:45:32] <gevaerts> Not the latest release of course :)
[13:45:45] <bagder> no surprise there!
[13:46:06] <gevaerts> 7.78, so also not prehistoric
[13:46:19] <bagder> https://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/plain/meta/recipes-support/curl/ actually has 7.79.1 though
[13:47:27] <bagder> ah, and that patch there (from 2016) was just now merged
[13:49:49] <gevaerts> The usual stable release thing
[13:50:53] <bagder> combined with "it works for us" so no pressure to upstream their patch(es)
[13:59:34] *** Tykling_ is now known as Tykling

[14:58:25] <bagder> now at 2931905001 pulls of the docker image
[14:59:19] <bagder> at 120 pulls per second, we should reach 3 billion in a few hours
[14:59:20] <gevaerts> That's a lot of CI jobs! :)
[15:00:02] <gevaerts> I mean, I'm assuming that's not individual people consciously downloading
[15:00:32] <bagder> a few them might be individuals
[15:01:21] <bagder> the average seems to be over 120/sec 
[15:01:42] *** Quits: Vonter (~Vonter@user/vonter) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[15:07:16] <icing> sounds pretty insane
[15:07:40] <bagder> I agree
[15:08:18] <bagder> the image has been provided 833 days, which makes an average of 150K pulls/day or 41/sec over the whole time period
[15:08:42] <bagder> so the rate is clearly rising
[15:13:19] <Piru> mm haven't looked into this stuff much but does this thing handle downtimes btw? I mean lets assume if the docker image thing would be down, what would happen? world would burn?
[15:14:17] <bagder> I don't know, but I think a pull isn't necessarily a download so I would imagine the majority is just a quick check
[15:14:33] <bagder> and if a check can't be done, I imagine it will just stick to what it already has locally
[15:14:35] <Piru> right. and hopefully there is rerundancy and caching and all that jazz
[15:15:09] <Piru> and sensible operations probably have local repos that mirror some other ones
[15:15:38] <bagder> hm, I think my math was off. We're about ~130 *hours* from reaching 3 billion
[15:15:48] <bagder> too many zeroes
[15:16:04] <gevaerts> That's only next week!
