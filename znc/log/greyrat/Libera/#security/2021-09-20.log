[11:24:15] <Descartes> By the way, it doesn't even make sense that those trojans are active and severe, because Windows Defender told me they're located inside Hirens Boot CD 15 ISO, which is in the Seagate USB external drive
[11:25:00] <Descartes> the trojans are Win32/Azorult!ml and Win32/CryptInject!MSR
[11:26:07] <noah61021> well, if you are able to live with the uncertanty all life, go ahead.
[11:27:08] <Descartes> The Clamtk scan of the system drive is almost done now
[11:27:20] <Descartes> It found 175 threats so far
[11:28:17] <Descartes> As I said before, most of them are probably false positives, but I suspect some of them are from those above Win32 trojans, because it looks like the trojans have changed my Windows Defender settings
[11:29:35] <Descartes> I guess that means when the scan is done, I'll have to pick and choose which files to delete and which files to keep, and then probably have to run another scan of the Seagate external drive

[15:47:09] <piou> Descartes: if it's sha256 then there's nothing specific to DOS exe, and it'll verify integrity but not authenticity. You can use "sha256sum FILE" through the command line which is probably already available.

[22:50:44] <electr0n> well he also unlocked devices that weren't owned by the individual
[22:51:30] <electr0n> they were still on lease. its fed law here in the states that you can unlock your device after 6 months on the network I believe. but even 6 months is a long time
[22:52:44] <MadCamel> yeah if you get a second-hand phone that's locked you have to put it on their network for 6mo to unlock it. I've ran into that several times and it's bs
[22:53:05] <electr0n> its why I buy outright.
[22:53:18] *** Quits: dskull (~dskull@user/dskull) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[22:53:30] <electr0n> but I also don't purchase 1200USD phones either when I can root them and unlock way more potential.
[22:53:43] <MadCamel> can be entirely bought and paid for, it doesn't get unlocked unless you ask, it's not automatic. Evil business practices that lead to massive amounts of electronic waste.
[22:54:18] <electr0n> you shouldn't have to ask but you do which is their way of getting around the law... damn loopholes
[22:54:19] *** Joins: dskull (~dskull@user/dskull)
[22:55:10] <MadCamel> The guy deployed malware on at&t's systems.. that unlocked phones. He could've stolen customer information of 9000 other profitable things, but chose to stick to unlocking phones. I nominate him for a robinhood award.
[22:55:25] <MadCamel> s/ of / or /
[22:57:45] <Hash> electr0n: yo
[22:57:52] <Hash> yeah, that's insane.
[22:58:44] <electr0n> MadCamel: there was much more he could have gone after to make even more money.
[22:58:49] <electr0n> you're absolutely right.
[22:59:15] <Hash> Until recently I had access to ICOMS
[22:59:18] <electr0n> why did it take so long, since apparently they uncovered the malware the same year it was deployed but yet he was somehow able to unlock 2mil devices?

[23:00:12] <electr0n> that seems to be an off-boarding issue then, they didnt remove your access. unless obtained illegal then you shouldn't be making those staetments in this channel.
[23:00:41] <electr0n> i have always been escorted out of the premises the second I give my 2weeks.

[23:01:10] <Hash> Seems like it no longer works.
[23:01:49] <electr0n> until recently doesn't clarify much on how access was obtained or retained. it was left open for interpretation.
[23:02:50] <electr0n> but yea, i have seen some ugly lapses in policies at previously employers/contracts.
[23:02:59] <electr0n> vpn accounts active 2 to 3 years after said employee left.
[23:03:25] <electr0n> domain accounts with admin, still active, and being used.... that's scary
[23:03:31] <Hash> *nod*
[23:03:57] <Hash> Obviously if it was illegaly obtained, I'd not be publicly noting something.
[23:04:35] <electr0n> you'd hope that was more common but hackers talk too much lol
