[00:05:35] <isf> no i dont like matrix becouse normaly you need run nonfree software writer in javascript
[00:06:04] <isf> kompowiec, libreplanet is so cool, i im organizer of a team on it
[00:06:15] <kompowiec> fantastic!
[00:06:53] <kompowiec> some time ago I tried to add categories to pages but the names of the places they refer to are ambiguous and unfortunately abandoned them.
[00:07:33] <kompowiec> and I beg yall, finally delete the Portuguese constitutions ...
[00:08:28] <isf> i want a funtion for translate wikis of libreplanet
[00:08:35] <isf> like trisquel wiki
[00:09:43] <kompowiec> when i translated articles i just use translator as rapid prototyping.
[00:10:44] <kompowiec> although I don't know if it makes sense to add automatic translation now, in particular I mean the current poor quality of LibreTransalte.
[00:13:36] <isf> i recommend use a dictionary

[00:21:00] <Noisytoot> You can just use argos translate locally.
[00:21:05] <isf> that im saying
[00:21:06] <Noisytoot> A dictionary is not really the same thing.
[00:21:37] <isf> if you dont go to self host a translate program is software as a serice

[05:56:35] <isf> without
[05:56:42] <DiffieHellman> su != sudo
[05:56:59] <DiffieHellman> You can't shutdown without root.
[05:57:04] <isf> and how
[05:57:09] <isf> how i can do it in my cli pc
[05:57:10] <isf> haha
[05:57:17] <isf> D:
[05:57:23] <isf> i dont create a root user maybe
[05:57:33] <DiffieHellman> The root user always exists
[05:57:44] <isf> how i can change
[05:57:46] <isf> the user?
[05:58:05] <DiffieHellman> The `su <user>` command changes the user
[05:58:19] <DiffieHellman> `su` on its own implies change to root btw
[05:58:20] <isf> yes but
[05:58:35] <isf> my user is not in the sudoers file
[05:58:46] <isf> so, i cant sudo su
[05:58:52] <DiffieHellman> You need to login as root with the root password
[05:58:58] <isf> how
[05:59:05] <isf> if i cant not power off
[05:59:06] <isf> xD
[06:00:12] <DiffieHellman> You removed the root account acciddently or something.
[06:00:15] <DiffieHellman> *?
[06:00:39] <isf> no
[06:00:54] <isf> xd
[06:01:05] <isf> i dont know how change my user from where i am to be a root
[06:01:15] <anton> su
[06:01:24] <anton> do you have the root password?
[06:01:28] <isf> yes
[06:01:31] <anton> good
[06:01:33] <isf> i have
[06:01:41] <isf> i create it in the installation
[06:01:48] <anton> `su` should work then
[06:01:50] <DiffieHellman> Then type just `su` without `sudo` as I instructed
[06:02:03] <isf> works!
[06:02:05] <anton> yay
[06:02:15] <isf> thanks!
[06:02:31] <isf> but
[06:02:34] <isf> how i can shutdown
[06:02:46] <DiffieHellman> `shutdown -h now`
[06:03:24] <isf> dont work
[06:03:27] <isf> command dont find
[06:03:33] <DiffieHellman> `halt` then
[06:03:43] <isf> halt?
[06:04:04] <isf> whait
[06:04:06] <isf> i did it
[06:04:08] <isf> :D
[06:04:12] <isf> nice
[06:04:27] <isf> my first experience in cli was: i create a folder and i create at text document
[06:04:32] <isf> i describe my first experience
[06:04:40] <isf> and, i save it 
[06:04:48] <isf> then i power off xD
[06:04:52] <DiffieHellman> My first main experience in bash was installing Gentoo.
[06:05:15] <isf> im in debian in my laptop without graphics i can run 100% free :D
[06:05:40] <isf> but, i dont know what to do in a computer without gui
[06:05:51] <DiffieHellman> Debian is 100% libre by default, it only becomes tainted if you start installing nonfree things.
[06:05:53] <isf> maybe i can install some "terminal music player"?
[06:06:06] <isf> i dont know
[06:06:09] <DiffieHellman> mpv will happily play without X
[06:06:27] <DiffieHellman> Generally you multiplex with tmux and then run applications of the finest quality.
[06:06:46] <DiffieHellman> rms fires up emacs and dones everything in there.
[06:07:12] <DiffieHellman> weechat is an excellent terminal irc client and is the best.
[06:08:44] <isf> i only have long etheternet cable for my desktop 
[06:08:51] <isf> athernet*

[09:48:30] <AIM[m]> Check this as well
[09:49:21] <AIM[m]> If you run it on web you can use AGPL
[09:49:29] <gothicserpent> so as a use case if your program was communicating over the network, you would use AGPL for your program?
[09:49:43] <AIM[m]> I don't think desktop applications will need AGPL
[09:50:00] <AIM[m]> gothicserpent: That may need to be looked up
[09:50:02] <gothicserpent> ah, so more HTML based?
[09:50:12] <gothicserpent> like a web-package of some sort?
[09:50:19] <AIM[m]> It doesn't have to be HTML based
[09:50:43] <gothicserpent> says in the tldr "network software"

[09:51:51] <gothicserpent> AIM[m]: if i plan on releasing my games on the google play store for free (but monetizing via in app purchases and banner ads) do you think GPL3 is too open?
[09:53:25] <labrador> Maybe if somebody is annoyed enough by them to strip it away and release their own version
[09:54:34] <gothicserpent> yes but they must release the original source as stipulation in the GPL3 and state significant changes made to software labrador 
[09:54:41] <gothicserpent> so if they are caught i guess i can prosecute, right?
[09:56:08] <labrador> I dont think they need to release the original source,just their source. So yeah if they do not release it you can prosecute
[09:59:58] <gothicserpent> i only released the gamecode under the license anyway, all of my actual data files (images/sounds/etc.) are all available on my computer mostly as unreal binaries or GIMP xcfs.
[10:00:12] <gothicserpent> labrador: so i guess it's not a real risk if it's just code "linking" these images and sounds together, right?
[10:00:30] <gothicserpent> couple thou lines of code, c#, c++ etc.
[10:02:19] <labrador> Software licenses and media licenses are different. The GPL does not care about media licenses at all. Look at doom for instance,GPL'd engine and proprietary assets.
[10:03:15] <gothicserpent> interesting. will have to google some media lic's
[10:04:08] <gothicserpent> ah nice, the doom license is interesting
[10:04:10] <gothicserpent> reading
[10:04:15] <labrador> Yea,if you want a "free" media license though,CC-BY-SA is a good one.

[12:03:04] <epony> IRC is just facebook since 2004
[12:03:45] <gothicserpent> if it makes you feel any better the conversation is now mostly about bluetooth polling
[12:04:09] <gothicserpent> hardware side is not my area of expertise
[12:04:10] *** Quits: Noxturnix (m-svoyoe@154.212.139.201) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[12:04:41] <epony> well.. that's mostly a mobile phone area anyway
[12:05:04] <epony> (bluetooth stack is weak on laptops and in free operating systems)
[12:06:02] <labrador> epny its bad because none of them play well with free software
[12:06:14] <epony> expensive and low quality audio and low security dongles for no added convenience, since the laptops have good enough inputs and outputs and loudspeakers and mics
[12:07:01] <labrador> epony yeah bluetooth codecs are very bad quality
[12:07:35] <epony> from a real free system perspective, and from technical stand point, even USB is.. not always well implemented and is not available to the system without BIOS modules etc
[12:08:03] <epony> BT is bad quality because it uses cheap schematics and low quality DACs
[12:08:22] <epony> and insufficient batteries that can't be replaced easy
[12:08:36] *** Joins: Noxturnix (m-svoyoe@154.212.139.201)
[12:09:05] <epony> and is sold expensive for "wireless extra cost" without much justification
[12:09:14] <epony> so.. is not even interesting
[12:09:26] <epony> bluetooth is a bit browntooth
[12:09:53] <labrador> A real free OS is a dream anyway for most of us
[12:10:46] <gothicserpent> browntooth lol
[12:10:56] <epony> it's also a reality with some compromises with regards to periphery and components that have built-in software
[12:11:24] <epony> just the OS is free enough since the mid-90ies
[12:11:36] <gothicserpent> the one thing i use browntooth for is connecting my cell phone audio playing foobar2000 to my car bluetooth receiver jack which plays the audio via the speakers :)
[12:11:41] <epony> GNU userland is being populated since say mid-80ies
[12:11:45] *** Quits: lethu (~lethu@user/lethu) (Remote host closed the connection)
[12:12:13] <epony> there are car stereos that accept USB sticks and SD cards

[12:12:32] <gothicserpent> i have an old in-dash, 2002 toyota highlander. i could get a newer in-dash though. just haven't gotten around to it
[12:12:47] <labrador> The applications could be free with some luck,the OS too,any thing below that is a nest of proprietary drivers and firmware,like ddr4 training blobs.
[12:13:13] <epony> you can't notice much in street noise anyway and the pop-music is mostly unlistenable quality

[12:16:10] <labrador> epony At least that can be done.
[12:16:32] <epony> everything can be done, just not "up to spec"
[12:17:15] <epony> for example even wireless card drivers are now reverse engineered and from scratch written, cause they reuse similar host interface chips
[12:17:37] <labrador> Isn't ath9k the only free one though?
[12:17:45] <labrador> Maybe I'm wrong
[12:18:32] <epony> after 2011 both Atheros and Ralink were bought by Qualcomm and Mediatek respectively and went underwater
[12:18:57] <labrador> Oh
[12:19:03] <epony> which were the two firmware-less (on device) chipset vendors
[12:19:12] <gothicserpent> my usb wifi adapter i use for my PC to connect up to my phone is like $2 lol
[12:19:24] <epony> they still have firmware, it's still not free and on device

[12:19:55] <epony> USB is a nasty touching
[12:20:06] <labrador> why?
[12:20:18] <epony> cause USB devices can change their type and behave like a keyboard and pointer
[12:20:25] <epony> so it's a serious concern

[12:23:13] <epony> yeah, OpenBSD and FreeBSD with changes
[12:23:25] <epony> (not public ones)

[12:24:13] <gothicserpent> epony: how many monitors do you use?
[12:24:16] <labrador> So you don't use GNU at all?
[12:24:43] <epony> and somewhat more conservative starting point in the system provided upkeep of basic principles of software fault mitigation
[12:24:55] <gothicserpent> labrador: what dist u use?
[12:24:57] <epony> I use GNU software when necessary
[12:25:29] <epony> I have a lot of monitors but use 1 per system
[12:25:38] <gothicserpent> i got 3 up rn
[12:25:44] <gothicserpent> no vesa stands sadly X_X
[12:25:52] <epony> good enough
[12:25:57] <epony> any monitor is better than without it
[12:25:59] <labrador> gothicserpent I use debian 11/kde

[12:26:13] <epony> I sometimes use 2 monitors per system but don't have enough
[12:26:23] <labrador> Atleast nobody is here to pester me about "u"
[12:26:24] <gothicserpent> and centos 8 x64 for my other droplet, was testing the waters
[12:26:28] <epony> centos 9 got released recently
[12:26:37] <gothicserpent> yeah i'll be pushing to 9 in a bit
[12:26:48] <gothicserpent> labrador: i keep mental notes :>
[12:26:53] <gothicserpent> i'm a careful cookie
[12:26:59] <epony> yeah, that is an artificial limitation to cancel / ban people, which I find absurdly stupid
[12:28:05] <labrador> Yeah like who on the internet does not understand abbreviations
[12:28:21] <gothicserpent> epony: the centbot in #centos keeps mentioning the EOL stuff lol
[12:28:24] <gothicserpent> 21:36:11	<centbot>	CentOS Linux 8 will go EOL on 31 Dec, 2021 -- in 18 hours, 23 minutes, and 49 seconds

[12:28:32] <epony> I've RH but lost the patience and used slackware in the mid-90ies and then FreeBSD and OpenBSD with the increase of "applicable" use cases for each

[12:29:30] <gothicserpent> whaa
[12:29:48] <labrador> epony nobody likes arguments,people get pissy man.

[12:31:25] <gothicserpent> haha
[12:31:25] <epony> (but nobody knows why)
[12:31:43] <gothicserpent> you're probably linus torvalds or something irl lol
[12:31:58] <gothicserpent> or elon
[12:31:59] <epony> I am not him, but I like people like that
[12:32:18] <gothicserpent> agreed
[12:32:23] <epony> like Linus and other intelligent ones
[12:32:48] <labrador> one thing i hate about the world is the infiltration of free software groups with open source users.
[12:33:15] <epony> just don't be that much concerned, things move and silly topics get shaken off
[12:33:35] <epony> it's a long debate which expired some 20+ years
[12:33:41] <epony> and then Sun is cancelled
[12:33:56] <epony> and the "workstation" market was really gone in 1995
[12:34:18] <epony> so proprietary UNIX is not possible since 1985
[12:34:20] <epony> things like that
[12:34:57] <kompowiec> gothicserpent, i once in my life, i touch ipad, it was sucks
[12:34:58] <epony> the bad thing was that the PCs were insufficient to run multi-process systems in the 8bit and 16bit epoch
[12:35:09] <gothicserpent> kompowiec: ewwwwwwww
[12:35:14] <epony> Apple does not know how to make computers..
[12:35:14] <gothicserpent> kompowiec: how did you survive it
[12:35:22] <gothicserpent> epony: what IRC client do u use? :>
[12:35:27] <labrador> Yeah but then I see people coming to gnu/linux only to then run proprietary apps.
[12:35:52] <epony> it did a couple of "open designs" in the early 8bit epoch on 6502 and then went greedy and proprietary, at which point IBM took everything
[12:36:42] <epony> gothicserpent, I can't tell you that, but it's nothing out of the "trivial" choices, so a very popular and buggy one
[12:36:57] <labrador> epony i feel like youre pretty old considering youre detailing this stuff
[12:36:58] <gothicserpent> i use weechat+glowing bear i love it
[12:37:08] <labrador> i use hexchat
[12:37:09] <kompowiec> gothicserpent, it's sarcasm?
[12:37:26] <epony> yeah, 45 but I started with computers when I was 3-4 years old
[12:37:43] <gothicserpent> labrador: i used hexchat for a bit and couldn't stand it cuz my connection reset when my VPN cycled every week.
[12:37:53] <epony> so 40+ years of continuous fun and counting with happy moments and great discoveries

[12:39:28] <kompowiec> even my brother, who is a totally normie non-tech user, he said that apple sucks because most of the applications were paid and on android they were freeware. Since then, he has not used their products. 
[12:39:58] <epony> had a couple of improved variants and then 8086, 80186 and 80286 and up from 20 on the 200 MHz Internet P5 MMX years

[12:40:51] <labrador> epony when did you get introduced to linux
[12:40:56] <epony> it was just the 6502 and 65C02 that mattered, the brand got cancelled by local reimplementations and production
[12:41:00] <kompowiec> labrador, well, he annoys me because it keeps encouraging me to install windows 10 or 11
[12:41:23] <epony> I read UNIX books as a kid and was playing around mini-computers and Digital PDPs
[12:42:07] <labrador> nice
[12:42:21] <epony> so did not know Linux existed prior to the Internet, which I used to get Unix, so.. Linux was just a temp step in the evaluation process in 1996-1998
[12:43:11] <epony> technically played with workstations and such at my dad's work and got to see HPUX there etc

[12:44:11] <epony> until the return of the power computing at home (personal) with the then 33k6 (v32/v34) interent
[12:44:14] <gothicserpent> i found the monstrosity in my closet! aieee
[12:44:31] <kompowiec> gothicserpent, i hope that with RockBox ;)
[12:44:44] <gothicserpent> am going to run through the rain to throw it away in the dumpster brb
[12:45:03] <kompowiec> ouch it some very simple hardware
[12:45:21] <kompowiec> it doesn't even have a screen
[12:45:30] <epony> labrador, so we were downloading Linux and BSD distributions in floppy files over modems from the other side of the ocean.. for days on no end..
[12:45:37] <epony> such were the times in 1996
[12:45:40] <kompowiec> sorry I don't know apple products at all.
[12:46:19] <kompowiec> nothing that is proprietary, will be worth my time.
[12:46:24] <labrador> I would have loved to see some 1970s style big iron unices.
[12:46:42] <epony> they were 1980 UNIX computers
[12:46:56] <labrador> yeah
[12:47:01] <epony> had teletypes and screen terminals and we replaced those with PCs
[12:47:06] <epony> and radio-modems
[12:47:09] <epony> so was quite fun
[12:47:24] <epony> wireless was a thing even back then ;-)
[12:48:07] <epony> just the speeds were 50 chars/sec

[12:48:22] *** Quits: lethu (~lethu@user/lethu) (Remote host closed the connection)
[12:48:32] <epony> that was obsolete technology with the PC epoch
[12:48:40] <epony> PCs were terminals and more
[12:48:48] <labrador> Which is why understanding terminal emulators is so hard
[12:49:01] <epony> and in the 90ies, there were no terminals and nobody needed them
[12:49:20] <epony> it's not very hard, they are primitive computers
[12:49:33] <epony> and understand character sequences on the serial port
[12:50:03] <epony> and were sold expensive and had lower capabilities than the PCs
[12:50:21] <gothicserpent> did you save the old hardware?
[12:50:43] <epony> old technology is relatively worthless, and only used for converting the programs and reimplementing it in emulation and for museums and legacy conservation projects

[12:51:27] <epony> you don't need old PCBs
[12:51:41] <labrador> Line disciplines,tty,pty and more
[12:51:55] <epony> yes, it's termcap / terminfo and even new programs like tmux have to support it
[12:52:09] <epony> yes, these are trivial pseudo-devices that your OS kernel exposes

[12:54:51] <labrador> ooh nice

[12:54:59] <labrador> yea
[12:55:03] <epony> each of 3 coulers and black
[12:55:08] <epony> colours
[12:55:38] <epony> which are just primary colours and a combination

[12:59:56] <labrador> whats an emote?
[13:00:13] <gothicserpent> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emote
[13:00:16] * epony orders IRC logs from 25 years ago
[13:00:28] <gothicserpent> In most IRC chat clients, entering the command "/me" will print the user's name followed by whatever text follows. For example, if a user named Joe typed "/me jumps with joy", the client will print this as "Joe jumps with joy" in the chat window.
[13:00:40] <gothicserpent> An emote is an entry in a text-based chat client that indicates an action taking place.[1] Unlike emoticons, they are not text art, and instead describe the action using words or images (similar to emoji). To emote is to display emotions openly, especially while acting.

[13:04:59] <gothicserpent> is swappiness=10 and vfs_cache_pressure=50 sensible?
[13:05:28] <epony> I don't recall these, but maximum swapinness is probably the opposite of what you want
[13:05:29] <gothicserpent> because my cache pressure default was 100 for cento

[21:31:00] <kompowiec> The Finn T. Katainen had the Tesla Model S repaired. It turned out that it was necessary to replace the battery with a new one - cost about 20 thousand. euro. An unacceptable amount for him. He decided to get rid of the problem once and for all - he used about 30 kilograms of dynamite and blew up the car.
[21:32:08] <labrador> The teslas are the big tech of the car world
