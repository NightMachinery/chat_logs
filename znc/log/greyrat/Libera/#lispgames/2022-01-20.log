[00:15:48] <dto> squeaking is good. :)
[00:16:01] <borodust> cool
[00:16:32] <dto> whats happening Common Lisp land? I heard that there is a controversy surrounding an unfortunate exchange between several developers.
[00:18:01] <borodust> dto: small drama, it's fine
[00:18:15] <dto> i hope it turns out okay.
[00:18:33] <borodust> i think it did turn okish
[00:18:54] <borodust> it actually goes back pretty far

[00:46:02] <dto> ln43: yes
[00:46:25] <dto> just curious
[00:46:25] <ln43> maybe later ...
[00:46:41] <ln43> ok i think CL is a great language of course
[00:47:01] <ln43> there are few others that are in my opinion on the same "level"
[00:47:34] <ln43> with some differences of course
[00:50:39] <ln43> dto: which 'dialects' of Lisp do you like more?
[00:51:14] <dto> cool! 
[00:51:34] <dto> i like CL for its speed and Object Orientedness
[00:51:56] <dto> i like S7 Scheme for its speed and expressivity 
[00:52:04] <ln43> yes true, i like smalltalk talking about object oriented languages
[00:52:07] <dto> i don't write games in S7 scheme but a closely related DSP area
[00:52:32] <ln43> interesting
[00:52:41] <dto> smalltalk is cool i've been learning Squeak
[00:53:35] <dto> what're you thinking about making with CL? 
[00:54:59] <ln43> i'm not using CL right now to be honest
[00:58:31] <dto> hey okey :)
[00:58:54] <dto> well hang around maybe something will inspire u
[00:58:58] <dto> there's also chicken scheme.
[01:00:12] <ln43> yes i was liking guile as Scheme implementation at the time i used it
[01:01:43] <ln43> ok but there are so many implementations that is really difficult to choose ...
[01:01:53] <ln43> like for CL and maybe more
[01:04:02] <dto> yeah CL can be bewildering in that respect
[01:04:10] <dto> Scheme probably more so
[01:11:16] <drakonis> ha, yeah, choice paralysis sure is something.
[01:11:51] <dto> hello drakonis 
[01:11:55] <drakonis> hey there.
[01:12:19] <drakonis> CL at least guarantees some degree of a baseline experience
[01:12:25] <drakonis> scheme on the other hand is highly varied
[01:12:41] <drakonis> it isnt a bad thing.

[01:59:51] <drakonis> oh i know!

[02:00:08] <drakonis> i tried pharo a while back and couldnt get into it
[02:00:19] <dto> don't know much about pharo
[02:00:42] <dto> what do you like to do with Scheme? which implementations
[02:01:02] <drakonis> hmm, i'm mainly playing around with guile
[02:01:33] <drakonis> figuring out how to write my own libraries and such
[02:02:36] <drakonis> CL has too many sharp edges for my tastes :|

[02:09:15] <drakonis> i really shouldn't take this opportunity to soapbox about CL
[02:09:44] <drakonis> anyways, guile's surprisingly great.
[02:10:09] <dto> cool drakonis hehe
[02:10:18] <dto> no worries. i'm fairly dialect agnostic
[02:10:39] <dto> i do elisp, and am even going to experiment with 2 different Schemes embedded in Squeak
[02:10:55] <dto> drakonis: what sort of libs do you want to make with guile? 
[02:12:15] <drakonis> an archiving library and rewriting guix's nix daemon fork in guile
[02:13:10] <drakonis> there's schemes embedded in squeak?
[02:13:13] <drakonis> that's news to me
[02:14:29] <drakonis> regarding pharo, there seems to be a couple conflicting reports on how it diverges from squeak
[02:14:36] <drakonis> apparently its an attempt at modernizing it?
[02:14:55] <drakonis> i've also seen a project that builds on pharo for doing notebooks and interactive presentations
[02:15:05] <ln43> which one?
[02:15:17] <drakonis> glamorous toolkit
[02:15:53] <ln43> really cool
[02:15:53] <drakonis> data analysis and all that
[02:16:03] <drakonis> https://gtoolkit.com/ extremely cool, yeah.
[02:16:10] <ln43> yes a way to replace ipython notebooks to say
[02:16:17] <drakonis> the challenge is convincing people to use it
[02:16:38] <ln43> i hope so
[02:17:25] <ln43> yes but smalltalk like CL are only for few persons
[02:19:12] <drakonis> i mean, CL can be quite impenetrable at times
[02:19:54] <ln43> i mean are niche products with a lot of potential and i think are not going to be never understood from the masses
[02:22:00] <ln43> the same is valid for forth or prolog to say ...
[02:22:20] <ln43> erlang ... maybe
[02:22:48] <ln43> ok but it's a matter of personal preferences of course
[02:24:36] <dto> drakonis: yeah there's one somewhat confusingly called ULisp, it is apparently a conformant scheme
[02:24:46] <dto> i haven't had a chance to do much with it yet though.
[02:24:51] <dto> there's also one embedded in Sandblocks.
[02:26:07] <drakonis> ha, i cant seem to find ulisp
[02:26:12] <drakonis> i found one written in c++
[02:27:09] <ln43> yes but the sources of ulisp are freely available or not ?

[02:41:50] <drakonis> r4rs, wow.
[02:41:56] <ln43> to have something that resemple smalltalk maybe one should use medley interlisp ?
[02:42:06] <ln43> or something similar ...
[02:42:31] <drakonis> its compliant against a 1991 scheme
[02:42:33] <ln43> i mean for the IDE part
[02:43:38] <drakonis> fairly behind the scheme curve.

[02:47:29] <dto> oh i see
[02:47:35] <dto> oh well
[02:47:43] <dto> anyway it might be fine for my purposes
[02:47:52] <drakonis> it is very old because scheme is very much not CL in which it has an absurd amount of features out of the box
