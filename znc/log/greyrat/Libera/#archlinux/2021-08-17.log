[02:12:34] <jmcantrell> I'm working on a script that's going to include a systemd timer, but the frequency of the timer is going to be different depending on how the script is configured. I initially thought about having a separate timer for each OnCalendar event that it supports, but that seems like it would be too much. Then I thought about having a single timer that get's changed based on the config, maybe using an "activate" command, similar to something like ufw.
[02:12:34] <jmcantrell> Anyone have any opinions on that, or maybe an example project that does this the "right" way?

[03:49:50] <kevr> The Lark!

[03:57:02] <kevr> that's what it's for
[03:57:42] <kevr> if it's not configured on those machines to use that place specifically for cache already, providing a --cachedir will tell pacman to just use the dir you specify as the cache dir instead.

[05:27:57] <ectospasm> Maybe both devices are on the same bus?
[05:28:13] <grawlinson> it's more likely that the manufacturer don't care.

[05:29:13] <ectospasm> This is all conjecture, though.

[07:20:00] <ishitatsuyuki> given the content of this statement calling them "spyware" is blatantly wrong, even though the initial actions by Muse Group was nothing but terrible
[07:21:54] <SysGhost> They might be rephrasing a few things, but the telemetry stuff is still in there. And the fact it's help up the way it is with Muse Group, which has some questionable actions under their belt.
[07:22:10] <mefistofeles> SysGhost: it's off by default, also
[07:22:38] <SysGhost> besides. Tenacity is a good fork many are jumping over too, so having it in the repos could be useful for a lot of users
[07:23:40] <SysGhost> I'm not saying Audacity shopuld be removed. Just have the alternative in there too.
[07:24:01] <ishitatsuyuki> at this point you're just introducing plain FUD, it should be stopped instead of introducing division in the community

[07:26:02] <SysGhost>  Isn't it time for Arch to get Tenacity in the official repos as well. Have more alternatives as more users are jumping over?

[07:26:46] <ishitatsuyuki> 1. the alternative is not better in any way and 2. more users are not jumping

[07:27:35] <SysGhost> okay.. I am. lots of people I have around here in musical and audio production, who are using arch, are jumping. So saying "nobody is jumping" isn't entirely true

[14:47:19] <mpan> tatsumaru: about a half of hour to get average network performance. Any period that covers the breakage if it’s about showing the breakage happens.

[14:56:48] <low-key> there was no mention of text-align here
[14:59:46] <mpan> Whether it is be supported or not, it would mean the alignment of the text within a component, not the position of the whole component. So unless the component fills in the entire available horizontal space, even in theory text-align wouldn’t be what you want. Just saying, so you are not going the wrong way.

[15:01:32] <mpan> Since Gtk3 seems to be supporting `margin`: is setting it to `margin: 0 auto` doing anything?
[15:01:38] <low-key> trying to center align the text in the input and entry widgets
[15:01:53] <mpan> This is what one would do in CSS in general.
[15:02:04] <low-key> but wouldn't that center the widget itself?
[15:02:09] <mpan> Yes
[15:02:11] <low-key> because they are where i want them to be
[15:02:18] <low-key> i am trying to align the text within the widgets

[15:02:43] *** Joins: SJrX (~sjr@S0106302303dfb018.vf.shawcable.net)
[15:02:45] <MrElendig> for most widgets you have to set the alignment on the widget itself, not trough css
[15:02:52] <MrElendig> at least in gtk3
[15:03:07] <mpan> I mean… I don’t know. Just giving a suggestion of what might work.
[15:03:13] <low-key> there is a text widget
[15:03:37] <low-key> MrElendig: but would that mean modifying the source code because that's not an option exposed in the config file
[15:03:56] <MrElendig> doesn't help that searching the new gtk docs sucks :/
[15:04:00] <low-key> text-align doesn't work with the text widget either
[15:05:35] <low-key> and there's another doubt i have, is it normal for swappy to not show the window borders as defined in the window manager?
[15:05:44] <low-key> no other window behaves in this manner
[15:06:33] <MrElendig> try content_halign in the wofi config instead?
[15:07:03] <low-key> oh my, completely missed that
[15:07:10] <low-key> i was so sure it would have to be set in the stylsheet
[15:07:13] <low-key> lemme go try that

[19:43:24] <niki> MacGyver: what prefix length are they handing out?
[19:43:41] <nij-> Lemme try to connect again using ipv4..
[19:44:00] <ArchNoob> Hello, So I'm facing the issue "failed to comit transactions (invalid or corrupt package)" when I update my system with `pacman -Syu`. I've tried doing `pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring` but the error persist
[19:44:00] <grawity> yeah, it can certainly be not by default because many ISPs outright do not offer IPv6, and many IT departments do not like dealing with IPv6 even if their ISP *would* offer it (see also: the other discussion happening here)
[19:44:07] <grazzolini> MacGyver: most ISP's suck
[19:44:10] *** Quits: Shiva (LordShiva@user/one39dev) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[19:44:20] <grazzolini> also, here in Brazil, the IPv6 rollout was mandatory
[19:44:32] <grazzolini> if the ISP's hadn't enabled it, they'd be breaching the law
[19:44:43] <grawity> so while the error message is weird (and possibly IT-shenanigans-related, as is the unexpected bind() call)

[19:44:55] <MacGyver> niki: Can't say, this router model is *very* barebones in its v6-implementation.
[19:44:55] <grawity> if the host you're connecting from doesn't have ipv6 then it doesn't have ipv6

[19:45:40] <MacGyver> niki: It's *probably* getting a /56 or /48 because I can have multiple networks, but I've never checked whether those networks get different prefixes.
[19:45:50] <grazzolini> grawity: yep, without replacing old equipment that didn't had firewall at all
[19:46:01] <grazzolini> grawity: which isn't a problem for ipv4 because of nat anyway

[19:47:59] <jelle> :D
[19:48:08] <Scimmia> ArchNoob: if that doesn't do it, we need full, complete errors. You only gave us a small part that tells us little
[19:48:26] <MacGyver> niki: That the router won't tell me what prefixes it's working with... *shrug*.
[19:48:26] <grazzolini> grawity: the irony is, my router can do ipv4 firewalling, but not ipv6
[19:48:31] <niki> MacGyver: yeah, and considering some bottom-of-the-barrel ISPs only hand out /64
[19:48:37] <niki> sounds not too bad now :p
[19:48:38] <nij-> grawity: But now it hangs after I run `ssh nij@server-ipv4-.. -p 12345`

[23:27:01] <eletrotupi> I don't really remember who helped me yesterday regarding a encrypted SSD
[23:27:16] <jamesp> I plugged in one flash drive into my computer (Arch Linux, KDE Plasma, NVIDIA Drivers) and as soon as it was plugged in it caused the mouse to glitch out and become unstable. The issue went away when I removed that drive.
[23:27:18] *** Joins: Aardwolf (~Aardwolf@li1098-140.members.linode.com)
[23:27:28] <eletrotupi> but I've decided to reinstall arch on that spare ssd and it's absolutely faster
[23:27:37] *** Joins: tehrig (~tehrig@89-162-46-181.fiber.signal.no)
[23:27:38] <eletrotupi> so yeah, probably being a cheaper ssd is the problem
[23:28:04] <jamesp> So I was told to try and see if the same issue happens on another drive, so I plugged another flash drive in and the issue went away.
[23:28:24] <eletrotupi> I've also took the opportunity to do a fully fledge arch install, will resume later today

[23:28:38] <eletrotupi> now just need to mount my zfs pool on the new install
[23:28:45] <Namarrgon> jamesp: what do you see in the kernel log when the "bad" device is plugged in and the mouse lags?
[23:28:54] <sukhman> how can i make gnome-panel shell to work with sway window manager
[23:29:18] <jamesp> Namarrgon I'll try it, one second. How do I view the kernel logs?
[23:29:29] <sukhman> i'm getting errors: Gdk-CRITICAL **: 00:26:27.854: gdk_x11_display_set_window_scale: assertion 'GDK_IS_X11_DISPLAY (display)' failed
