[10:38:37] <Andrew> Yay, thanks!
[10:38:41] <herd> stupid opensource friends
[10:39:05] <AwesomeAdam54321> Was Linux ever licensed under GPLv2 or later?
[10:39:15] <Andrew> AwesomeAdam54321: Nope
[10:39:18] <Andrew> GPL2 only
[10:39:43] <DiffieHellman> Please don't say "GPL2" btw
[10:40:15] <Andrew> GPLv2, sure
[10:41:06] <damo22> some files of Linux kernel have the "or (at your option) any later version" mentioned in them
[10:41:12] <herd> well, linux-libre can be relisense to gplv3+
[10:41:16] <herd> right?
[10:41:16] <damo22> but they might be bogus
[10:41:20] <Andrew> herd: No?
[10:41:36] <DiffieHellman> herd: No it cannot, the patches can be licensed to GPLv2-or-later but that's it.
[10:41:51] <Andrew> The patches can be GPLv3
[10:42:10] <AwesomeAdam54321> but they can't be included with GPLv2-only files
[10:42:19] <herd> gplv2+ = gplv3+
[10:42:35] <Andrew> herd: Sure
[10:42:35] <damo22> im not a lawyer, but i dont think you can patch the files and redistribute them as GPLv3
[10:42:47] <DiffieHellman> herd: Yes, you can combind GPLv2+ with GPLv3+, but not GPLv3+ with GPLv2-only
[10:43:00] <Andrew> Oh, yeah that's the issue
[10:43:09] <Andrew> ~~make a new kernel~~
[10:43:15] <damo22> i am
[10:43:17] <Andrew> Hurd is still quite unstable, BSD is nice
[10:43:34] <DiffieHellman> Which BSD kernel>?
[10:43:37] <Andrew> Well, as Lispers, we need to work on Mezzano and make it GNU
[10:43:42] <Andrew> DiffieHellman: I like the OpenBSD one best
[10:43:52] <Andrew> I heard that FreeBSD contains stupid binary blobs
[10:44:00] <AwesomeAdam54321> Rather than making a new kernel, I think contributing to the HURD would be less work
[10:44:03] <Andrew> OpenBSD's policies fobid that
[10:44:03] <herd> r u lisper?
[10:44:10] <damo22> Andrew, i gave a talk at FOSDEM'22 last week on Hurd + NetBSD drivers
[10:44:21] <Andrew> herd: Depends on the definition :)
[10:44:25] <Andrew> Hmm...
[10:44:52] <herd> as in Lisp / cLisp
[10:45:21] <Andrew> Schemer
[10:45:23] <Andrew> (Not scammer)
[10:45:26] <herd> nice
[10:45:31] <damo22> Andrew: https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/dzammit/
[10:45:58] <Andrew> damo22: I'll get to them when I start Xorg again, thx
[10:46:08] <herd> eLisp <3
[10:46:31] <Andrew> eLisp, I'm not that familiar with it, but I can do basic operations
[10:46:37] <Andrew> i.e. quoting, car, cons, cdr (lol)
[10:46:44] <herd> lol
[10:47:10] * Andrew wants emacs to be a standalone operating system
[10:47:20] <herd> yeeah lol
[10:47:30] <damo22> you can probably do that
[10:47:30] <Andrew> I mean, you can do anything in Emacs, no need for coreutils etc
[10:47:37] <herd> emacs as os
[10:47:39] <Andrew> However we need to write an eLisp kernel, hmm
[10:47:46] * Andrew checks the license of Mezzano
[10:47:52] <AwesomeAdam54321> The only thing missing is probably device drivers for Emacs
[10:48:01] <Andrew> Exactl
[10:48:03] <Andrew> -y
[10:48:17] <Andrew> Maybe do GNU Emacs/OpenBSD?  Seems sane to me
[10:48:19] <damo22> why not boot hurd and start emacs as an ELF
[10:48:27] <damo22> static binary
[10:48:47] <Andrew> Sounds normal
[10:49:03] <Andrew> And since the OpenBSD kernel is under the BSD license (of course), it's compatible with GPLv3
[10:49:05] <Andrew> Better than Linux
[10:49:28] <Andrew> https://github.com/froggey/Mezzano, MIT License
[10:49:33] <Andrew> We could take stuff from there
[10:49:43] <Andrew> (But... some people want the system to be completely AGPL)
[10:49:57] <damo22> hurd gives you more flexibility, since it implements system calls via glibc
[10:50:05] <herd> i dont like the "open" stuffs
[10:50:10] <damo22> and everything is interposable
[10:50:12] <DiffieHellman> Ehh, AGPLv3 has its place, but there's no need for it to be over all
[10:50:18] <herd> i like the libre stuff
[10:50:27] <Andrew> http://metamodular.com/Common-Lisp/lispos.html
[10:50:43] <damo22> dont write a new OS, contribute to Hurd so it runs on modern hardware
[10:50:53] <Andrew> damo22: I don't like UNIX-like
[10:51:23] <Andrew> Pipes and file descriptors aren't sustainable and scalable
[10:51:26] <herd> he like windows like lol
[10:51:43] <Andrew> No, that's even more retarded
[10:51:48] <DiffieHellman> How else are you meant to do things without fd's?
[10:51:55] <Andrew> DiffieHellman: try reading http://metamodular.com/Common-Lisp/lispos.html
[10:53:27] * Andrew forgot to compile virtualization support into his kernel and tries to run Mezzano on a LiveUSB
[10:53:52] <damo22> the thing about microkernel model is that you can separate the drivers into separate processes, thus you can even have a GPLv2-only driver inside a GPLv3+ OS
[10:54:14] <herd> 1984 rms write the GNU System
[10:54:28] <DiffieHellman> damo22: Yes, you can add Linus as one of the servers :3
[10:54:31] <herd> 1985 rms write GNU emacs
[10:54:32] <DiffieHellman> *x
[10:54:50] <damo22> we could, but it would be a big blob
[10:55:04] <herd> 2023 rms write GNU emacs OS
[10:55:30] <Andrew> Should I send RMS an email? lol
[10:55:33] <damo22> rumpkernel allows you to be fine grained on what to include from the driver stack in userspace
[10:55:53] <herd> yes lol
[10:55:54] <damo22> thats why we are using netbsd drivers, because it has rump already

[11:00:04] <Andrew> (Not-really-)GNU/Systemd/Linux :P
[11:02:45] <damo22> the problem with breaking linux into library modules is that the internal api for calling driver code keeps changing

[16:45:01] <leonarth> DiffieHellman can't the nodes still sniff your packets?
[16:45:36] <DiffieHellman> The data is encrypted so it's only readible for the onion service, and then it's encrypted 6 more times, and sent through 6 relays. 
[16:45:53] <GNUHacker> leonarth: yes, they can
[16:46:17] <DiffieHellman> leonarth: All a relay can see is the encrypted data and also instructions where to send it next.
[16:46:53] <DiffieHellman> A relay decrypts its own layer of encryption to find out where to send it next.
[16:47:24] <leonarth> [14:00]  [GNUHacker] vpn track u, just use tor
[16:47:36] <DiffieHellman> For exit nodes, as they need to actually see the request to peform it, when the decrypt the packet, they see the data (but that can be mitigated by using HTTPS).
[16:47:37] <leonarth> GNUHacker was wrong here, as I just used tor my IP would be visible to clearnet
[16:47:46] <leonarth> s/as/if

[16:48:15] * GNUHacker is away
[16:48:34] <DiffieHellman> For onion services, no relay needs to see the transferred traffic, and none don't. At the last hop, the onion service decrypts the last layer of the onion
[16:48:42] <leonarth> then exit nodes can be used to spy on people
[16:49:12] * isf is having fun with Trisquel 9.0.2
[16:49:24] <leonarth> the last layer contains the full request w/ data then
[16:49:25] <DiffieHellman> leonarth: Yes, just like how any router on the internet can spy on people. The solution is using TLS or using onio services instead
[16:49:55] <DiffieHellman> leonarth: The only thing that can decrypt the last layer for onion services, is the onion service server - which you kinda need

[16:52:41] <Andrew> GNUHacker: The last node doesn't use encryption if you're going to the clearnet.  If you're still in the onions, it's still encrypted.  No HTTPS needed at all.
[16:52:48] <leonarth> govs can still use letsencrypt CA master keys to decrypt all
[16:53:11] <DiffieHellman> leonarth: That's not how it works, but okay. Do you need a lesson on TLS?
[16:53:12] <isf> lo digo, porque imaginate si yo te envio una foto en un mensaje cifrado gnuhacker, te llega el texto, bien siendo así seria mejor cifrar una carpeta entera no?
[16:53:53] <DiffieHellman> The CA just signs the certificate, they don't get the encryption keys - that remains on the hosting server.
[16:54:31] <Andrew> It's kinda like the Web Of Trust (but centralized).

[16:55:03] <Andrew> What?  CAs should never ask for your private key!
[16:55:19] <Andrew> You should be sending them a certificate request (or whatever that's called) file instead.
[16:55:20] <DiffieHellman> How it works [hey CA, here's my certificate, sign it for me] --> CA goes; sign(certificate) and send it back. You then go and display; [certificate][CA signature]
[16:55:29] <GNUHacker> isf: esque depende de la config de tu cliente de correo, lo mejor es que hagas pruebas
[16:56:33] <DiffieHellman> leonarth: If a "CA" requires your private key, and you hand it over, you're getting scammed hard and the NSA loves you. Most likely you just got confused about which is the keys and which is the cert
[16:56:44] <leonarth> hence the only way to decrypt and sniff my traffic is to obtain somehow my private key

[17:02:52] <leonarth> Cracker was meant to be the catch-all label for anyone doing anything unscrupulous with a computer— pirating software, defacing websites, and worst of all, not understanding what they were doing. But very few people use this term today.
