[07:25:12] <dre> fdan, so you get the response, right
[07:25:24] <fdan> yes?
[07:25:29] <dre> and then you cache it
[07:25:57] <fdan> cache it in the client side?
[07:26:02] <fdan> like a browser cache?
[07:26:38] <dre> well django is a server framework
[07:26:52] <dre> I don't know what exam you're doing fdan
[07:27:05] <dre> but it could be either client / server, depending on who's asking
[07:27:29] <fdan> hmm ok
[07:27:46] <dre> well that's not true... the server doesn't cache responses, it sends responses. it's probably clientside for what you're talking about fdan
[07:27:56] <fdan> sure
[07:28:07] <dre> but the general premise with "response caching" is that you get the response and you cache it :)
[07:28:29] <fdan> i see
[07:28:45] <fdan> i have one more question. the cookies and headers? what are the differences
[07:28:56] <fdan> are they the same key-value things?
[07:29:02] <fdan> or functionality wise they differ
[07:29:04] <fdan> ?
[07:29:08] <dre> no cookies are definitely edible.,
[07:29:31] <fdan> :)
[07:29:45] <dre> fdan, it'd be more beneficial if you played around and saw for yourself how they work

[11:48:51] <serafeim> hello friends
[11:49:04] <serafeim> i saw the release notes of django 4 and didn't see anything groundbreaking
[11:49:18] <serafeim> what's the reasons of changing the major version ?
[11:49:30] <serafeim> i.e why django 4 instead of django 3.3 ?

[11:57:17] <serafeim> hm ok yes i saw it but i can't understand the reasoning
[11:57:31] <serafeim> i mean what's the problem of having 3.3 after 3.2 LTS or 3.5 LTS etc ?
[11:58:12] <apollo13> no problem
[11:58:24] <apollo13> we just wanted something "simple"
[11:58:57] <serafeim> ha ha ok it is simple however people are usually used to change major versions when something "big" happens
[11:59:11] <serafeim> i.e the 1.11 to 2.0 was really big (drop py2 support)
[11:59:22] <apollo13> django is so "stable" that we usually will not have such big changes
[11:59:24] <serafeim> the 2.2 to 3 not so much. same as 3.2 to 4
[11:59:42] <serafeim> yes ok i understand
[11:59:44] <apollo13> depends on the PoV, for me there were big changes in each of those releases

[11:59:58] <serafeim> well maybe but definitely not as big as the 2.x :)
[12:00:41] <apollo13> I guess the main thing to get used to: Django is a stable framework that evolves slowly
[12:00:51] <apollo13> we value stability etc more over new features

[12:02:29] <apollo13> well then you maybe know the fun times from 0.96 to 1.0 -- even those were "small" releases ;)
[12:03:14] <dre> django is great; I love this framework
[12:03:19] <apollo13> (those were fun times btw, ie models were generated at some point)
[12:03:22] <dre> I'm so glad i took it onboard
[12:04:16] <serafeim> yes it is there's also a related discussion on HN for anybody interested
[12:05:11] <apollo13> serafeim: which one of the many :D
[12:05:23] <serafeim> it is on the front page
[12:05:35] <serafeim> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29303611
[12:05:37] <apollo13> ah rather small for now :)
[12:05:55] <apollo13> btw I have been playing with unpoly js recently
[12:06:03] <serafeim> well it is on fp so it will probably gain traction
[12:07:03] <apollo13> It is made by the Rails LTS company. They have some really interesting ideas and it allowed me to change a normal page to SPA like with minimal effort
[12:08:55] <apollo13> https://demo.unpoly.com/ if anyone is interested
[12:09:27] <serafeim> i remember it... isn't it similar to intercooler js ?
[12:09:55] <serafeim> i.e assign attributes to elements to do ajax work ?
[12:11:01] <apollo13> jupp kinda. But more geared towards an application feeling
[12:11:47] <apollo13> or maybe call it a little bit more oppiniated than htmx
[12:12:05] <apollo13> ie unpoly has a concept of overlays (popups etc) and how to integrate those and get data back
[12:12:20] <apollo13> ie create a new object in a popup and get back the newly created id
[12:14:03] <serafeim> hm that's interesting
[12:14:19] <apollo13> let me find the slides

[15:54:53] <lllama> Afternoon all - hopefully a quick async question. Can I implement long polling with vanilla async views?
[15:57:21] <apollo13> probably but why :D
[15:58:24] <lllama> I'm playing with HTMX as part of an upgrade to an existing app. Currently it polls every 5 seconds - I'm looking to see whether I can use SSE instead.
[15:58:44] <apollo13> polls every 5 seconds != long polling != SSE :)
[15:58:45] <lllama> (without Channels if I can help it)
[15:59:05] <lllama> True, true. But long polling is a lot closer to SSE than polling.
[15:59:19] <lllama> And moving from evry 5 seconds to something else counts as an upgrade
[15:59:27] <apollo13> does it?
[15:59:43] <lllama> yep
[15:59:44] <apollo13> I'd stay with the "every 5 second poll" if you can
[16:00:29] <apollo13> also even if you were to use vanilla async views you'd now have to start with an async webserver in the first place
[16:00:48] <apollo13> and depending on your setup maybe even two, one for the sync parts and one for the async ones
[16:01:16] <apollo13> but yes you can do long polling and SSE with vanilla asnyc views
[16:01:21] <lllama> that's fine. I'm using this as an excuse to learn k8s, so the webserver is the least of my issues
[16:01:43] <apollo13> I'd use everything as an excuse not to learn k8s :D
[16:02:09] <lllama> I've been putting it off. But then I found tilt.dev and I don't hate it as much
[16:03:22] <lllama> So what do I need to be returning? HttpResponse? StreamingHttpResponse? They both complain about async_generators not being iterable.
[16:05:20] <pycode1> is there a reason that django is printing None instead of nothing in template?
[16:05:22] <pycode1> i do
[16:05:45] <apollo13> lllama: you can just return a httpResponse; but you need a "async def" for your view and need to run django via asgi
[16:05:48] <pycode1> object.address (i am using DetailView)
[16:06:05] <pycode1> {{ object.address }} print None in the template
[16:06:18] <apollo13> sounds as if it literally contains the string "None"
[16:06:25] <pycode1> i would like to "convert" it into an empty string
[16:07:06] <pycode1> apollo13, i see NULL
[16:07:08] <pycode1> in db
[16:07:22] <apollo13> well then your code or so calls str() on that I think
[16:07:30] <apollo13> please see the topic for providing the relevant information
[16:07:50] <carlio> you could just do {% if object.address %}{{ object.address}}{% endif %} and it'll just print nothing
[16:08:14] <carlio> or an {% else %}""{% endif %} if you explicitly need an empty pair of quotes
[16:08:28] <pycode1> i really do not have too much to say because i just have <h5 class="card-text">{{ object.address }}</h5> that's it... and the "object" is the self.object is coming from DetailView
[16:08:48] <pycode1> carlio, yes i should adopt a thing like that but it sounds strange to me
[16:09:01] <apollo13> mhm I'd have to double check but I thought none wouldn't print
[16:09:11] <apollo13> I mean you can add |default('')
[16:10:03] <carlio> assuming you want an empty <h5> tag then apollo13's solution is probably best ; often you don't really want to have an empty HTML element as styles will have a big gap so ymmv
[16:10:40] <pycode1> apollo13, if i do self.object.address inside the get_context_data i see None
[16:10:45] <pycode1> but it is not a string
[16:10:50] <pycode1> i see Null on DB
[16:11:00] <pycode1> so i do not know why django is writing None
[16:11:09] <apollo13> ok I just checked, None does indeed render as None
[16:11:10] <pycode1> apollo13, yes with default:'' i see an empty string
[16:11:15] <pycode1> so i suppose the address is really None
[16:11:23] <apollo13> so yeah, "if" or "default" is what you need to use
[16:11:23] <pycode1> apollo13, aaah ok
[16:11:27] <pycode1> perfect
[16:11:29] <pycode1> thank you!
[16:12:23] <pycode1> bye!
[16:12:32] <carlio> o/
[16:12:34] <pycode1> have lunch :D
[16:13:28] <apollo13> lllama: HttpResponse is obviously only suitable for long polling, not sure what you'd have to do for SSE
[16:13:48] <apollo13> most likely https://github.com/fanout/django-eventstream
[16:14:39] <apollo13> but I'd have to dig into the django source to see how you could properly send a SSE response, StreamingHttpResponse doesn't sound that wrong for SSE
[16:14:48] <apollo13> although not exactly what one would want
[16:14:56] <apollo13> channels would probably be a better fit

[16:17:57] <lllama> thanks apollo13. I shall investigate further. StreamingHttpResponse _should_ be what I want but things like https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63316840/django-3-1-streaminghttpresponse-with-an-async-generator seem to suggest that it won't work.
[16:18:39] <lllama> But I'll get a proper test rig set up with htmx. If nothing else, that seems quite simple to convert from polling to SSE.
[16:19:12] <apollo13> lllama: well as a middleground you could use long polling
[16:19:29] <apollo13> because then you could just await in the view and return a httpresponse when it gets data
[16:19:38] <apollo13> for low volume this might be doable

[17:48:24] <Camilo> Well spotted though. The address successfully saves to the DB, and is successfully retreived from the DB but for some reason the address app thinks it is not an address instance
[17:50:25] <GinFuyou> Camilo, hm, so error happens after migration is applied in typical use?

[17:51:41] <LordKalma> question: does this seem like a reasonable way to do ORing with Q-objects and django-filter? https://github.com/ruilvo/radioamadorismo-website/blob/master/backend/repeaters/views.py#L40
[17:51:42] <Camilo> This is supposed to be just a data migration. I can save Address to the DB, and I can save Property to the DB, but when I try to assign an address to a property I get this error
[17:51:58] <GinFuyou> so, no, it happens during the migration.

[17:52:35] <Camilo> Yes, sorry happens when I run manage.py migrate
[17:53:07] <GinFuyou> Camilo, well, I'd also think it's a issue with address lib and historical models
[17:53:34] <GinFuyou> what if you sed address_id instead as probable workaround?
[17:53:42] <carlio> Camilo: I think it's because the entire migration step is run as a transaction, so that when the Property.objects part runs, the row does not exist yet
[17:53:53] <carlio> maybe
[17:54:19] * carlio handwaves
[17:55:10] <Camilo> GinFuyou: I made the changes AKX suggested on SO, but unfortunately still got an error (although a slightly different error)
[17:55:31] <carlio> LordKalma: you could do `filter |= Q(...)` instead of `filter = filter | ` but that's not a functional thing just an observation
[17:56:00] <Camilo> carlio: I don't think that's the problem, in the full code I assign people to buildings in exact same way and it works. Only addresses don't work because for some reason it thinks Address.objects.get() does not return an address instance
[17:56:04] <LordKalma> indeed indeed carlio
[17:56:12] <LordKalma> but other than that, you agree with the approach?
[17:56:12] <carlio> also cleaner would be just to do `filter = queryset` probably instead of filter=None then you have fewer if statements

[17:56:30] <carlio> generally it makes sense to me, I'm just nitpicking :)
[17:56:41] <LordKalma> how would `filter = queryset`  be a better start?
[17:57:33] *** luischi is now known as luigibu
[17:57:34] <GinFuyou> Camilo, yes I've read that, but what about my suggestion? If you want to dig the root of the issue instead of workarounds, have to explore that traceback too
[17:57:36] <carlio> Camilo: if you add a pdb breakpoint or something, do you know what Address.objects.get(raw="1 Fake street") returns? just wondering if you have a custom modelmanager which does not raise a DoesNotExist and it's silently returning a strange type? I got nothing
[17:57:39] <GinFuyou> and field code

[18:06:23] <Camilo> carlio: the .get() statement seems to be working, throws errors if results not equal to 1, and the string representation of the model is returned in the error
[18:08:07] <GinFuyou> That's doesn't really tell what type it is
[18:08:39] <Camilo> GinFuyou: ah, at last, I think you solved it! Thank you!
[18:08:50] <Camilo> address_id=Address.objects.get().id
[18:08:55] <GinFuyou> I'd rather suspect check in the lib gets a wrong model type, but checking each step never hurts
[18:10:02] <GinFuyou> Yes, I suspect this should bypass instance type check, but be warned it's workaround that skips proper validation
[18:10:24] <GinFuyou> not sure if it's actually proper one in this case since you have that error
[18:14:07] <Camilo> yeah I'm just really confused how the validation fails, as far as I understand I'm using the same model in both places.
[18:16:10] <GinFuyou> Well, we don't know what lib uses. I didn't take a look how fields usually do the check
