[01:01:41] <phogg> barteks2x: even if you don't script the result the rsync -n thing will let you at least get a list of what you need to clean up without having to figure that out separately. if you get the list and want help scripting removal then let me know
[01:02:53] <phogg> barteks2x: it should list everything whether it was already copied or not. You can get it to list only things not yet copied by adding -u (I think, did not test)
[01:03:08] <barteks2x> There are hundreds of thousands of files in subdirectories
[01:03:47] <phogg> barteks2x: if you want to remove them all it's pretty simple
[01:03:50] <barteks2x> anbd without -v it just outputs |skipping directory .|
[01:04:10] <phogg> dump the output of rsync -vn to a file, remove the first line and the summary lines at the end
[01:04:33] <phogg> now you have a newline-delimited list of file paths relative to the target dir. All of them were either copied and should be removed or do not exist
[01:04:35] <barteks2x> Yes, simple but I'm kind of reluctant to experiment as I'm likely going to get some bash escaping wrong and get a disaster
[01:04:46] <phogg> presuming that nothing in the target was overwritten, of course. Can't do anything about that.
[01:04:54] <phogg> barteks2x: that's what I'm here for
[01:05:00] <barteks2x> it's unlikely anything would have the same name
[01:05:01] *** kish^ is now known as kish`
[01:05:31] <phogg> barteks2x: something like this: while IFS= read -r path; do echo rm -rf -- "$path"; done < /tmp/the-file-containing-the-rsync-output-after-you-trimmed-it
[01:05:50] <phogg> barteks2x: I have taken the liberty of de-fanging it by putting "echo" in front of the rm.
[01:06:08] <barteks2x> wouldn't rm -rfv -- do the same thing?
[01:06:16] <barteks2x> oh wait I see
[01:06:23] <phogg> that way you can run it to see what commands it would run. If it looks reasonable you can remove the echo and run it again (while cd'd into the target dir) and remove the files
[01:06:32] <phogg> barteks2x: you don't need -v
[01:06:50] <phogg> rm -v will print what it did *as it is doing it*, it doesn't *prevent the removal*
[01:07:05] <phogg> it's just extra spam in your terminal

[01:08:03] <phogg> if you want to get fancier you can do something like [[ -e $path ]] && rm -rf "$path" to prevent it from trying to remove files that were not copied
[01:08:11] <phogg> this will reduce the number of printed error messages
[01:08:18] <phogg> not essential, but it might make you feel better
[01:08:22] <barteks2x> which one will be faster?
[01:08:42] <phogg> probably the latter version

[01:11:25] <barteks2x> Also wouln't it have ti read the file in reverse to delete the leftover remainign directories?
[01:11:26] <omero> barteks2x: have you ever considered rsync having a --dry-run (-n for short) option?
[01:11:35] <phogg> barteks2x: if you want to batch things use: xargs -d '\n' rm -rf -- < /tmp/your-file
[01:11:39] <barteks2x> \I wouldn't have seen it with dry-run
[01:12:19] <omero> oh you would have, 2>&1|tee rsuncout.log
[01:12:19] <phogg> barteks2x: that would be more complicated scripting. You can probably get away with just doing 'rmdir *' afterwards which will remove any now-empty dirs

[01:12:39] <phogg> but I think it won't matter, rsync *should* have listed each dir at each level
[01:12:45] <barteks2x> oh wait rm -rf will delete the ditrectory first and then try to delete every no longer existing file inside
[01:12:57] <phogg> barteks2x: yes, which will harmlessly fail
[01:13:24] <phogg> if you want to go through extra effort you can make it appear less scary by avoiding printing out errors you don't care about

[08:30:27] <jim> well those live things, are generally bootable images, and some can boot from either usb stick or cd blank
[08:30:42] <wizhurd> looking for a screen reader that work in the linux console
[08:30:54] <godSend23> ohhhhh
[08:31:05] <godSend23> new term for me = live OS
[08:31:18] <matsaman> we used to call them 'liveCD' images, but
[08:31:20] <matsaman> CDs are gone
[08:31:34] <matsaman> point is they're basically read only till you boot them up and load them all into ram
[08:31:48] <matsaman> wizhurd: screen readers are pretty crappy, I'd suggest looking at what blind people use
[08:32:20] <matsaman> espeak with text clients and the like
[08:32:30] <godSend23> and i can attach an ext HDD and tell the live OS (on a USB) to copy the data from the m.2 to the ext HHD?
[08:32:38] <matsaman> godSend23: most likely
[08:32:39] <jim> godSend23, then you have a fairly complete os with most or all the tools you need to copy stuff. do you have the disk you want to copy the m.2 to?

[08:33:03] <matsaman> godSend23: you just need support for the FS for each storage device, NTFS and whatever is on the external, which most live OSes will have
[08:33:06] <godSend23> the live OS has complete access to my laptop's hardware?
[08:33:13] <matsaman> godSend23: if you can boot it, it should yes
[08:33:26] <godSend23> oh man... never done this before
[08:33:29] <matsaman> godSend23: so boot it up, lsblk -f and find the m.2
[08:33:36] <godSend23> this sounds magical!
[08:33:49] <matsaman> mount it to someplace (mkdir -p /mnt/m2; ntfs-3g /dev/WHATEVER /mnt/m2)
[08:33:56] <matsaman> and mount your external in a similar fashion
[08:34:01] <matsaman> then rsync -av from one to the other
[08:34:12] <matsaman> rsync -av /mnt/m2/ /mnt/backup/m2/

[08:35:01] <matsaman> well there are GUIs, but I don't use them
[08:35:07] <matsaman> they're fairly imprecise in this context, IMO
[08:35:10] <jim> matsaman, I -suspect- his m.2 needs to be physically plugged in before it can be accessed
[08:35:18] <godSend23> so is knoppix (the repair guy) my best bet?'

[12:18:42] <Bushmaster> that link is useful thanks pipapipapipo  but I am interested to find out the high level language written to develop lets say Debian or Mint
[12:19:08] <arahael> Bushmaster: Distributions, such as linux, consist of a large number of programs, each of which can be written in many different languages.
[12:19:19] <arahael> Bushmaster: Erm, I meant, "Distributions such as *debian*".
[12:19:20] <Bushmaster> arahael,  of course
[12:19:40] <arahael> Bushmaster: So, asking for "the" high level language written to develop debian doesn't make much sense.
[12:19:40] <Bushmaster> I got it first time, typos are for english people, not for me

[12:26:15] <Sauvin> Everything you can get in binary for from stock Debian repos can also be gotten in source form with a lightly different apt-get install invocation.
[12:26:41] <Sauvin> (think I lost an 's' in that sentence somewhere)
[12:27:06] <Bushmaster> Sauvin,  yes I think I got the picture now, that link you provided mention about binary is no useful to me anyhow and it then xplained how to access source code package
[12:27:13] <arahael> Bushmaster: Debian does come with source packages for everything, they're just not neccessarily downloaded by default, same as you don't download the other several terabytes of applications if you haven't chosen to install them.

[12:58:18] <hexnewbie> That would be true. But you could probably do a Matlab/Octave scripting interpreter inside Python, and not the other way round. (Well, both are turing-complete, so you could go both ways, but this one would make more sense). I meant that meaning of ‘higher’

[13:20:05] <Bushmaster> OS is made up of many programs which dudes class it as packages. These packages are then added in one big directory which is basically all your OS source packages which ThinkT510 dude neatly demonstrated to me, these package parts are written in high level languages which in most cases is C++, these packages can be seen in Github

[13:32:19] <trbp> by the way bushmaster, after sorting it out a bit more what is kernel and toolchain      and stuff you could also go a bit further and 'learn it the hard way' by looking into linux from scratch and maybe try it out, there you obviouly have all of your source from 0 to running system ;)
[13:32:23] <Bushmaster> arahael,  oh sorry, you did ask me that before, what is it? high level language?

[13:33:06] <Bushmaster> looking Linux from scratch meaning what ThinkT510 has give me ?
[13:33:11] <Sauvin> And I'd recommend octave for math stuff.

[13:34:08] <Bushmaster> arahael,  never created any Java projects dude, just utilized Java codes to solve math problems for example, if I throw a ball 25 degree angles to 100 meter high, what time it will take and what distance it will travel before hit the ground etc
[13:34:42] <Bushmaster> Sauvin,  not keen on Octave, I utilize R instead of Octave and Maxima for Symbolic Algebra, all comes with Debian anyway

[14:10:53] <arahael> Bushmaster: Then a package script puts it into the .deb package so that when you do 'apt-get install goon_dog', it fetches that .deb, unpacks it, and copies the binaries in the right spot.

[14:14:24] <arahael> Bushmaster: Consider "ls", which is, I think, part of coreutils.  So in producing the coreutils package, the sources are obtained, compiled, and in this case more than one program is produced but are then packaged into the 'coreutils' package.  This is a very core package, so is always installed by default in Debian systems.

[14:17:37] <Bushmaster> so when you say packaged up, what you meant is all those programs that are source coded, after compilation gets packaged up which as I far I can understand is binary versions of all the programs in various directories

[14:47:30] <arahael> Bushmaster: You're looking at Serenity's Ports system there, and yes, that's how they do it for that, they're basically external packages that the serentity team have packaged up to make it convenient to install.
[14:47:33] <mags> well, that's about the time I would expect for me at least, I was thinking of going hardcore, like getting to the point where I could watch a youtube video
[14:48:01] <colo> TheSilentLink, in most cases, no. that would require these errors to be persisted to disk, and that\s not possible if the machine has locked up.
[14:48:07] <koollman> but the goal wasn't really to do it fast, more to learn and try to understand what I was doing. "ok ... I compile this ... but what is it, and what does it do?" :)

[22:52:05] <danieldg> _73: the environment variables are usually different, and you can set one specifically in the crontab for this
[22:52:09] <MinusOne> _73, you could have your program look at its parent processes
[22:52:10] <matsaman> ayecee: sentience and the elimination of the human plague!
[22:52:28] <danieldg> you should *not* look at the parent process for this
[22:52:34] <_73> ayecee: I want to prevent certain flags to be used unless it is a cronjob
[22:52:35] <matsaman> the very easiest way would be to simply pass a parameter telling your program what situation it's in
[22:52:52] <matsaman> or you could use a wrapper to the same effect

[23:08:08] <MinusOne> danieldg, the only reason I can think that analyzing the parent process (and parent's parent etc if necessary) wouldn't work is if cron's behavior was to spin off the executed program and let it be inherited by PID 1. But I can find plenty of examples of using PPID to determine whether a program is invoked by cron, so I don't think that is the case

[23:09:05] <MinusOne> is it that you think it is an overly obtuse solution, when a command line flag is simpler to implement?
[23:09:23] <danieldg> MinusOne: what if the parent process is anacron, not cron?
[23:10:14] <MinusOne> ok, so the issue is that you would have to track multiple program names and wouldn't be able to guarantee that the calling program wasn't an instance of a cron implementation

[23:57:19] <MrElendig> we make cairns to help navigate in snow/fog, but sadly lots of tourists build them at random for fun which have caused issues
[23:58:23] <two_dogs> MrElendig, may i suggest gps
[23:58:27] <knotMez> MrElendig have you given any thought to using mobile GPS?
[23:58:34] <joo> You guys complaining about your geographical locations ?
