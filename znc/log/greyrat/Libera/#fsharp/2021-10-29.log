[20:07:59] <MatthiasVance> "runExpr would then execute the DSL in some way (unfortunatelly it is not yet possible to compile it back to executable code and just run it)." https://fpish.net/topic/None/57493
[20:10:11] <MatthiasVance> Hm, this translates to LINQ and then compiles it: http://fsprojects.github.io/FSharp.Quotations.Evaluator/reference/fsharp-quotations-evaluator-quotationevaluationextensions.html
[20:10:30] <MatthiasVance> I don't want LINQ, I want F#
[20:10:31] <MatthiasVance> =)
[20:10:46] <MatthiasVance> Maybe I should just generate C# that calls F#, using F#
[20:10:50] <MatthiasVance> And get it over with
[20:13:50] <biberu> :D
[20:14:27] <biberu> or just write this component in c#?
[20:16:39] <MatthiasVance> That would mean every component
[20:16:56] <MatthiasVance> I just need a way to "do code" :P so either textual generation or expressions

[22:40:00] <indomitable> MatthiasVance, did you quit your fancy job or are you still in it
[23:30:15] <MatthiasVance> indomitable: I told them we'd have to go our separate ways in a good way, then proposed to do that Dec 1st and that I'd quit and asked them to strike off 4 "extra" vacation days I've used
[23:31:30] <MatthiasVance> And we're in the middle of getting ISO certified (audit is next week), asked the HR guy today "you were going to get back to me about those days", he: "yeah we are going to have to take that over the audit week, I would have to calculate stuff (which he already did)"
[23:31:43] <MatthiasVance> So it was a bullshit excuse on their end and a big fuck you to me apparently, glad I'm leaving
[23:34:24] <MatthiasVance> Those 4 days are going to cost me EUR 1200 :'(
[23:34:40] <indomitable> :-/ dicks
[23:35:38] <indomitable> am i doing the math wrong here or is that very low pay for your position
[23:35:38] <indomitable> lol
[23:35:54] <indomitable> 1200 euros for 4 x 8 hours work equates to like 38 euros an hour
[23:36:23] <MatthiasVance> Yeah I'm not on CTO salary, I do get shares (well not anymore xD)
[23:36:35] <MatthiasVance> 6.5k EUR before taxes approx.
[23:38:25] <MatthiasVance> It's a very small company, so it was (should have been) more an unique opportunity in all the other ways
