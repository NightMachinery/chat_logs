[07:21:34] *** Joins: progandy (~progandy@user/progandy)
[07:22:19] <thurstylark> no, because nobody cares about ports at this stage in the process. all that hosts is dealing with is name resolution, like dns. Just matching names to ip addresses. once you have that ip address, now you can choose what port you want to connect to. It's up to the host at the end of the line to either listen on that port for traffic or not.

[14:09:32] <grawity> navidrome is a specific version, navidrome-git is literally whatever the latest code is today, whether it works or not (also the navidrome-git package seems to be somewhat unmaintained, so I'd avoid it)

[14:10:07] <grawity> hmm how about pkcheck with org.freedesktop.RealtimeKit1.acquire-real-time

[16:13:49] <BrainDamage> restarting isn't a bad idea, pacman already aborted when ssh truncated

[16:14:25] <Scimmia> if it was and the initramfs didn't get updated, restarting is bad

[16:20:40] <kek_> hi, I'm a bit confused about python. Had a big mess a year ago. I installed python3.8 using the AUR package but now I need e.g. numpy for it too. What's the correct way to install numpy for my python3.8?

[16:22:46] *** Joins: kib (~kib@user/kib)
[16:23:00] <grawity> e.g. clean disconnect usually sends a more immediate SIGHUP
[16:23:18] <BrainDamage> in either case, wait a bit, reboot and see if goes back on
[16:23:25] <th0rne> Sounds like a plan, thanks.
[16:23:27] <BrainDamage> and check pacman log if it does
[16:23:42] <th0rne> Sure.
[16:23:51] <grawity> and yes pacman does deliberately set a SIGHUP handler, but that handler waits for alpm_transaction to "be interrupted" i.e. it's supposed to exit after the specific package is done, but not necessarily wait for the whole update
[16:24:28] <th0rne> And if it's on post-transaction 4/25?
[16:24:29] <BrainDamage> if it doesn't, mount it and pacman -S the same packages, hoping it was just last transaction that broke it

[22:15:30] <mike_k> Hey. A systemd/suspend question. How can I configure the exact command to use that is triggered by etc/systemd/sleep.conf action(s)? The exact "problem" is that lid close suspends my lappy in a way that it can be walek up with the keyboard, while "systemstl suspend" does the same (according to system log), but power button blinks and should be pressed to wake up. (Sorry if that is not very Arch 
[22:15:36] <mike_k> specific, but maybe it is due to some defaults we have.)
[22:15:52] <hrtk> I recently got a mac as a work laptop. Surprised to see that there's a wiki page on Mac as well, though it does mention that it doesn't support new macs. Mine is macbook air M1, is there any hope of running arch stably over there ?
