[07:08:29] <vrurg> .tell Xliff smoke testing was just an example. I'd be glad to hear somebody really started it.
[07:08:30] <tellable6> vrurg, I'll pass your message to Xliff
[07:09:50] <vrurg> .tell Xliff BTW, if you still suffer from missing imported symbols, I know what the cause is and how to get around it until a proper fix is developed.
[07:09:51] <tellable6> vrurg, I'll pass your message to Xliff
[07:11:25] <japhb> vrurg: Do tell?
[07:11:47] <vrurg> japhb: pardon?
[07:15:48] <Xliff> vrurg: Indeed
[07:16:17] <Xliff> vrurg: I am a bit curious. How is "smoketest" different from Blin?
[07:16:46] <Xliff> Would a web front-end on Blin be sufficent for the task?
[07:16:48] <vrurg> A bit late today, I'm almost afk already. Remind me tomorrow. But basically, creating explicit to-level module and use it in every submodule should work.
[07:17:00] <Xliff> And please, a workaround would be wonderful!
[07:17:18] <vrurg> Xliff: as to smoke test, consider a distributed infrastructure for it.
[07:17:29] <vrurg> Similar to what they have in perl.
[07:17:55] <vrurg> Too late already, afk for late dinner.
[07:18:16] <Xliff> I don't know what they have in Perl. Also, distributed infrastructures requires a decision on what handles the distribution. We'd need to spec that out.
[07:18:33] <Xliff> vrurg: OK. See you tomorrow. Looking forward to it.

[15:56:07] <sena_kun> o/
[15:57:30] <sena_kun> Can anyone with a docker setup help me confirm something please? I need `docker run -i -t rakudo-star:2021.04 /bin/bash` and then to see if `apt-get update` works.
[15:58:29] <El_Che> running it
[15:58:47] <El_Che> or ruining it
[15:58:55] <El_Che> eye of the beholder thing
[15:59:07] <El_Che> works
[15:59:28] <sena_kun> geh
[15:59:35] <El_Che> I use podman though
[15:59:35] <sena_kun> it fails for both my machines somehow
[15:59:47] <El_Che> dns?
[15:59:48] <sena_kun> same for 2020.10
[15:59:59] <sena_kun> Temporary failure resolving 'deb.debian.org'
[16:00:07] <El_Che> DNS allright
[16:00:24] <El_Che> that's a host failure, probably
[16:00:55] <sena_kun> Oh, it's the same for nginx image, then something is wrong with my two machines with completely different environments.
[16:01:04] <El_Che> yeah
[16:01:07] <sena_kun> It resolves nicely on the host of course, but not in containers.
[16:01:08] <El_Che> DNS or bridge setup
[16:01:16] <El_Che> try pinging
[16:01:18] <El_Che> an ip
[16:01:27] <El_Che> so you know if it's network or dns
[16:01:44] <El_Che> ping 8.8.8.8
[16:02:40] <sena_kun> it pings the deb.debian.org IP well, same for ping 8.8.8.8
[16:02:57] <sena_kun> in /etc/resolv.conf I have `nameserver 192.168.8.1`, which is presumably host?
[16:03:45] <sena_kun> aye, that's router
[16:04:03] <El_Che> search local
[16:04:03] <El_Che> nameserver 10.0.2.3
[16:04:03] <El_Che> nameserver 172.16.1.5
[16:04:26] <El_Che> it puts the bride address and my network setup
[16:05:22] <El_Che> are you claiming port 53 on one of your containers?
[16:05:38] <sena_kun> No
[16:06:09] <sena_kun> My current idea is to overwrite resolve.conf to point to something working like 8.8.8.8 and see if it helps.
[16:06:32] <El_Che> that's a workaround and not a fix
[16:07:00] <sena_kun> Well, I need to release Comma somehow. :P
[16:07:16] <sena_kun> El_Che, if you are curious to investigate, then please elaborate what do you mean by "search local"?
[16:07:47] <El_Che> that's a paste of my resolv.conf
[16:07:58] <El_Che> search local means it attaches .local to hosts
[16:08:14] <El_Che> you can safely ignore it
[16:08:34] <sena_kun> Ah, I thought it's something for me to do to get more details.
[16:08:35] <El_Che> sena_kun: try --nds
[16:08:37] <El_Che> dns
[16:09:09] <El_Che> run -ti --dns 8.8.8.8
[16:09:18] <El_Che> if you need a less hacky workaround
[16:10:23] <El_Che> I don't know your setup, maybe it's confused by the systemd resolvconf

[23:49:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> I apologize for this ignorant question: Are the new RakuAST functionalities available in the Raku version I will get if I use `rakubrew build moar-blead master` ?

[23:50:49] <MasterDuke> no, the work hasn't been completed yet so it's happening on the rakuast branch
[23:50:55] *** Joins: gordonfish (~gordonfis@user/gordonfish)
[23:51:14] <[Coke]> I think you need the rakuast branch, and an env var, and I don't think it's been rebased since new-disp landed.
[23:51:55] <MasterDuke> i'm not sure if you need the env var anymore
[23:52:11] <MasterDuke> but i'm pretty sure it was rebased just today
[23:52:24] <[Coke]> oh, nifty
