[01:01:21] <Guest0> There's also WealthSimple
[01:01:59] <Nanobot> Find investments that you believe will grow over the course of the next 10+ years. Try to buy low relative to where it's been (not relative to where you think it'll go). Don't touch it for at least a year. Eventually, sell at a higher price than you bought.
[01:02:38] <Guest0> Nanobot You seem very knowledgeable in this. Are you a quant?

[03:48:03] <Nanobot> Google has apparently decided to block me from using Google News unless I sign out of Google. The reason: Because my Google account was originally part of Google Apps For Your Domain, which eventually turned into Google Workspace, which they just recently decided Google News is not part of and is therefore now inaccessible from all those accounts. So, I literally cannot use Google News while signed into my Gmail account anymore.

[08:20:44] <tyawp> amigojapan, Flatland? I didn't hear about it.
[08:21:11] <amigojapan> tyawp: Flatland is a fiction book that talks about math
[08:21:31] <tyawp> amigojapan, like Alice in wonderland?
[08:21:37] <amigojapan> tyawp: specifically about dimensions
[08:21:54] <tyawp> amigojapan, interesting
[08:21:54] <amigojapan> No. It's more mathy

[08:25:45] <tyawp> amigojapan, oh thanks. I love Gutenberg Projekt.
[08:25:45] <amigojapan> Great :)
[08:26:42] <tyawp> amigojapan, in Japanese, inflating one's reading list is called Tsundoku(積読) and I heard that it is even in English dictionaries.
[08:26:58] <tyawp> my Tsundoku list is huge
[08:27:11] <amigojapan> Wow
[08:28:58] <amigojapan> tyawp: also I go to a local Buddhist temple for meditation lessons
[08:29:30] <amigojapan> tyawp: but I am not a Buddhist
[08:31:26] <beaky> is tsundoku like tsundere
[08:31:47] <tyawp> amigojapan: Japanese Buddhism is merged with Shintoism, so I felt like I'm in Jinja when I visited a Buddhist shrine once in Japan.
[08:32:14] <amigojapan> 積める is to pile up beaky
[08:32:51] <amigojapan> tyawp: the one I go to is shingon sect
[08:33:55] <amigojapan> tyawp: did you go inside?
[08:34:08] <tyawp> amigojapan: no, i didn't
[08:34:48] <amigojapan> tyawp: it's fun to go inside
[08:35:08] <tyawp> amigojapan: I heard about Kuukai(空海) a lot and I know that he's a monk of the Shingon sect

[08:40:10] <amigojapan> I see
[08:40:50] <tyawp> amigojapan, I heard that they ask you a "zenmondou(禅問答)", did you answer correctly?
[08:42:27] <amigojapan> tyawp: isn't that for zen?
[08:42:50] <tyawp> amigojapan, I still don't understand what's zen tho.
[08:43:40] <tyawp> amigojapan, it's long way to understand the true meaning of zen
[08:43:41] <amigojapan> tyawp: zen is another sect of Buddhism. Shingon is yet another
[08:43:55] <tyawp> amigojapan, it's different thing? I didn't know that
[08:44:28] <amigojapan> Yup zen and shingon are totally different
[08:45:22] <amigojapan> tyawp: in zen "meditation"is sitting looking at the wall. And if your posture is bad they hit you in the shoulder
[08:45:56] <amigojapan> tyawp: in shingon "meditation"is now like excersize

[08:50:33] <amigojapan> Lol tyawp 
[08:51:13] <amigojapan> tyawp: in zen they do hit you in the shoulder with a stick
[08:53:07] <tyawp> amigojapan, that's hurt.
[08:53:32] <amigojapan> Yes
[08:53:44] <amigojapan> But not in shingon
[08:54:43] <tyawp> amigojapan, shingon rejects violence. it's a true advocate of peace.
[08:55:34] <amigojapan> Hehe yes altho I don't think zen is really "violent"either

[08:59:18] <amigojapan> I just took that picture tyawp 
[09:00:17] <tyawp> amigojapan, ty. I like Japanese CVS :)
[09:01:12] <tyawp> amigojapan, especially that microwave machines. those are very powerful (1500W!)
[09:01:17] <beaky> looks oishii
[09:01:33] <tyawp> amigojapan, I wanted to have one, but they're really expensive.
[09:02:19] <amigojapan> tyawp: I only have 500watt microwave
[09:03:00] <ButterNoodle> I read that as 500watt microphone
[09:07:01] <tyawp> ButterNoodle, 500W microphone is enough to resonate through very spacious room
[09:07:02] <amigojapan> tyawp: also my microwave recently broke down. I need to buy a new one
[09:08:48] <amigojapan> But I am kind of broke so I have been putting it off
[09:09:20] <tyawp> amigojapan, I had used microwave for about 10 years when I lived in Japan. That machine don't break that easy. I bet you've used it for long time.
[09:09:52] <amigojapan> tyawp: my wife used it for 25 years
[09:10:13] <tyawp> amigojapan, I knew it.
[09:10:24] <amigojapan> :)
[09:12:19] <amigojapan> tyawp: maybe I should check inside to see if it is something simple like blown fuse
[09:12:49] <tyawp> amigojapan, be careful.  fixing microwave yourself is extremely dangerous.
[09:13:08] <amigojapan> Ah right. High voltage
[09:13:27] <amigojapan> Like CRT TV
[09:14:20] <tyawp> amigojapan, exactly. it has a condenser inside which is dangerous.

[14:16:15] <JesseDesu> can i store images in a database
[14:16:36] <JesseDesu> i guess technically my wordpress is a database with images
[14:16:45] <amigojapan> JesseDesu: you can buy it is a bad idea

[14:17:33] <amigojapan> JesseDesu: are you sure if is storing the pictures inside the database, I doubt it
[14:17:58] <JesseDesu> it gets cumbersome having to review a gallery and compare it by eye
[14:18:40] <amigojapan> Jesse it probably stores the image ID and the image file resides somewhere
[14:18:47] <JesseDesu> i'm pretty sure wordpress with gallery plugins uses a database
[14:19:08] <JesseDesu> i'm not totally sure
[14:19:15] * JesseDesu shrugs
[14:19:20] <amigojapan> Even if it uses a database it does not mean it puts the images inside the database
[14:19:39] <JesseDesu> hmm
[14:20:07] <JesseDesu> do you use any image/album software
[14:20:20] <JesseDesu> i tried using digikam
[14:20:51] <amigojapan> JesseDesu: yeah it's as I thought "By default, WordPress stores all your images and media uploads in /wp-content/uploads/ folder on your server. ... WordPress also adds information about your image uploads in the database. Information about your uploads is stored in database as a attachment post type under the posts table.

[18:24:54] <Cryowolf> the final few episodes with the 3d
[18:24:57] <Cryowolf> it was horrible
[18:25:07] <beaky> yes 3d gives me motion sickness
[18:25:18] <Cryowolf> it looked dumb and unnatural and out of place
[18:25:21] <saganman> I wish we would get another season of log horizon
[18:25:22] <lastonestanding> can't they do 3d with 60fps?
[18:25:46] <Cryowolf> that makes it worse
[18:26:11] <Cryowolf> 3d needs to have more cut-off to make it fit in with 2d animation
[18:26:15] <lastonestanding> saganman: but there was a new season in 2021

[18:32:29] <Cryowolf> I wonder what Matrix 4 will be about...with a lot of them dead and all, does this mean they're basically computer programs on file, uploaded into new clone bodies that are in pods? Or are they now actual computer programs, unable to break out. Because everything happened the way it was supposed to, except for Agent Smith. But I don't think Zion and "the real world" was actually real
[18:32:42] <Cryowolf> I think it was just another layer

[18:33:44] <lastonestanding> what is Zion?
[18:33:49] <Cryowolf> him and Henry Cavill, best
[18:34:10] <saganman> I love Keanu too
[18:34:14] <Cryowolf> Zion is supposedly the last city, the remaining bastion of humanity
[18:34:24] <Cryowolf> lastonestanding, just watch the movies dude
[18:34:26] <lastonestanding> is that a biblical term?
[18:34:26] <saganman> I don't think any human can hate Keanu
[18:34:34] <lastonestanding> I watched the first movie!
[18:34:40] <Cryowolf> then watch the other two
[18:34:44] <lastonestanding> but that was in 1999 or so
[18:34:56] <Cryowolf> the 2nd isn't that bad but the 3rd is meh
[18:34:58] <saganman> I think Zion is jewish term
[18:35:05] <lastonestanding> !c zion
[18:35:06] <ImoutoBot> lastonestanding: Mount Zion is a hill in Jerusalem, located just outside the walls of the Old City. The term Mount Zion has been used in the Hebrew Bible first for the City of David and later for the Temple Mount, but its meaning has shifted and it is now used as the name of ancient Jerusalem's Western Hill.
[18:35:20] <lastonestanding> aha
[18:35:28] <Cryowolf> the 2nd has the highway chase and that's an action sequence that I still love
[18:35:33] <Cryowolf> very intense
[18:35:33] <saganman> because you have zionism and zionist movements
[18:35:51] <Cryowolf> everything in the matrix has religious undertones
[18:35:58] <lastonestanding> why does the bot say "hebrew bible"?

[18:36:56] <lastonestanding> saying hebrew bible sounds more like an insult I would think
[18:37:06] <Cryowolf> paraphrasing
[18:37:33] <saganman> Cryowolf: interesting
[18:37:40] <lastonestanding> you don't say arabic bible either
[18:37:43] <lastonestanding> right?
[18:37:49] <amigojapan> lastonestanding: like the word "God"is also English. Are you saying translations are wrong
[18:38:06] <beaky> kamisama
[18:38:20] <saganman> I wonder if machines/AI can be deceptive like humans. They had already agreed for peace.
[18:38:22] <beaky> (though i pray for a cute megamisama)
[18:38:33] <beaky> like aqua-sama
[18:39:01] <Cryowolf> saganman, what makes it the most interesting to me is that they finally found a matrix that worked for all but a few, a few who wanted to break out. I believe this world we saw them in, what they believe to be the real world. Is actually another simulation, for those who could't believe in the regular matrix
[18:39:24] <Cryowolf> and the matrix has gone through many versions and updates, revisions etc according to the oracle and architect
[18:39:41] <saganman> hmm
[18:39:50] <Cryowolf> the first version was a Utopia, but that basically scrambled peoples brains because they refused to accept it
[18:39:55] <amigojapan> Interesting Cryowolf 
[18:39:56] <Cryowolf> they didnt believe it to be real
[18:40:15] <Cryowolf> the trailer for Matrix 4 is out btw
[18:40:18] <Cryowolf> not just a teaser
[18:40:18] <lastonestanding> is Neo a jesus then?
[18:40:22] <Cryowolf> a 2.5 minute trailer
[18:40:24] <saganman> woah
[18:40:44] <lastonestanding> neo means new I think
[18:40:44] <amigojapan> lastonestanding: the call him "the one
[18:40:54] <Cryowolf> yes Neo is "the chosen one", who has come before, many many many times according to the architect
[18:41:01] <Cryowolf> Neo isn't the first Neo
[18:41:05] <Cryowolf> and won't be the last
[18:41:16] <lastonestanding> like Buddha?
[18:41:24] <Cryowolf> I don't know
[18:41:47] <lastonestanding> I think Reeves was in the movie Little Buddha also
[18:42:15] <Cryowolf> also in the trailer, Neo is chewing on blue pills until the next version of Morpheus offers him a choice
[18:42:22] <Cryowolf> only this time, he remembers everything
[18:42:25] <lastonestanding> lol

[18:43:24] <Cryowolf> It's also possible that this is a war between two computer operating systems
[18:44:07] <Cryowolf> one that now worships Neo after he saved them from Agent Smith and the other one that seeks his and that programs destruction, since it's the "update"
[18:44:23] <Cryowolf> bringing with it a new Morpheus etc
[18:44:46] <saganman> just watched the trailer

[18:44:48] <lastonestanding> one is open source and the other one is closed source?

With a massive amount of luck as she rises in wealth and fortune quicker than anyone thought possible, catching the eyes of the emperor that demands she share her secret. After learning her secret the emperor demand to have his heart cut out...ending with his death. Now she has somehow been elevated to empress, a life she had never expected

Expecting greatness he gracefully accepts and grows two goat horns, ears and a tail. The Empress wish he had

[20:46:26] <Jigsy> Right in the feels.

[20:46:59] <Jigsy> Don't worry.
[20:47:01] <Jigsy> It'll be boiled.
[20:47:06] * TsundereNoises worries
[20:47:16] <TsundereNoises> WHY WOULD YOU BOIL MEAT?
[20:47:24] <Jigsy> ...
[20:47:32] <Jigsy> You seem to be under the impression that British people can cook good food.
[20:47:50] <Jigsy> The UK is not known for:
[20:47:52] <Jigsy> 1. Attractive women
[20:47:53] <Bco1981> you boil chicken to make chicken curry
[20:47:53] <Jigsy> 2. Good food
[20:47:57] <TsundereNoises> if cooking = sterilizing the food I guess mission accomplished...
[20:48:10] <TsundereNoises> Bco1981: I sure as hell don't
[20:48:16] <TsundereNoises> Bco1981: if it's in a sauce, it's braising
[20:48:19] <Bco1981> you fry it ?
[20:48:23] <TsundereNoises> Bco1981: but I brown the meat a bit first anyway
[20:48:29] <Jigsy> Chicken goes in the oven.
[20:48:40] <Jigsy> Well, that's how Mom does hers anyway.
[20:48:43] * Jigsy can't eat chicken.
[20:48:49] <aian> Jigsy: r u 50s
[20:48:53] <TsundereNoises> Bco1981: I cook it to about half-way done in a pan to get some better flavor on the outside of the meat chunks, then cook the rest of the way in the sauce (which isn't boiling)
[20:48:55] <Jigsy> I'm 34.

[20:50:38] <TsundereNoises> you simmer
[20:51:07] <TsundereNoises> Bco1981, Jigsy: I have had the dreaded boiled meat, it is offensive to all good carnivores
[20:51:36] <TsundereNoises> Bco1981: what's meant is throwing a big chunk of meat in boiling water and "cooking" it that way
[20:51:37] <Guest85> chicken soup for the nerds soul
[20:51:41] <TsundereNoises> it does make the meat not-raw
[20:51:43] <TsundereNoises> but that's about it
[20:51:48] <TsundereNoises> tough, miserable
[20:51:52] <Jigsy> Everyone through human history ate boiled meat, though.
[20:51:58] <Jigsy> Kings, romans, neanderthals, dinosaurs.
[20:52:06] <Jigsy> -r+R
[20:52:09] <TsundereNoises> grilling is probably the oldest cooking technique
[20:52:36] <Jigsy> Well they're wrong!

[21:11:51] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The British can't cook meme is kind of over stated. Also slow-cooking meat in stew is perfectly sound.
[21:12:08] <TsundereNoises> Aurora_v_kosmose: yes, but that's not what's meant by boiling
[21:12:23] <TsundereNoises> braising and simmering are both technically different things
[21:12:31] <Guest85> the issue with Vtubing, some people have attachments to cartoons.
[21:12:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I fail to see the issue.
[21:12:55] <TsundereNoises> it's just our most recent version of people looking down on anime for no reason
[21:13:17] <Guest85> it's like the matrix
[21:13:17] <TsundereNoises> it's a way for some nerds to set themselves above other nerds for no real reason
[21:13:47] <TsundereNoises> there's never been a good reason to dislike anime but like whatever other nerd shit, anime is so damn broad
[21:13:55] <Guest85> there is a nerd spectrum
[21:13:57] <TsundereNoises> but for decades people did, it was a way to feel superior to another group
[21:14:17] <TsundereNoises> vtubers are just the newest version, some people make a point of not watching vtubers and feel superior about it

[22:14:18] <Guest22> emmeka farming?
[22:15:13] <emmeka> Guest22 yeah. more specifically, an agronomist at an experimental farm belonging to the university, doing research & seed development.
[22:15:22] <Guest22> i see
[22:15:30] <Guest22> are you a fan of monsanto?
[22:16:24] <emmeka> Monsanto no longer exists
[22:16:48] <Guest22> it's a shame
[22:17:11] <emmeka> vape glyphosate erry day
[22:17:35] <Nanobot> Monsanto got bought out by aspirin.
[22:17:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Nanobot: lol seriously?
[22:18:08] <Nanobot> I didn't know aspirin was more lucrative than the entire agricultural industry.
[22:18:14] <Nanobot> Aurora_v_kosmose: Bayer
[22:18:17] <emmeka> Aurora_v_kosmose yes. Bayer did.
[22:18:21] <emmeka> also it was a disaster
[22:18:35] <Bco1981> drugs maan... it's all about the money.
[22:18:43] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Most medication costs nothing to make, requires very little time and is basically a guaranteed cashflow without any real investment.
[22:18:48] <Guest22> Valeant is also impessive
[22:18:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Especially if you've mostly cruising by on brandname and common medication.
[22:18:59] <emmeka> the purchase was a very bad one for Bayer, they paid way too much and Monsanto never made up for it, and I think to this date Bayer as a whole is worth less as a company than they paid for Monsanto 5 years ago.

[23:25:08] <Bco1981> Nanobot: you should probably wash off the walls before you use the spraypaint
[23:25:12] <TsundereNoises> Urchin[emacs]: at first I thought it was a stuffed sea urchin for some reason
[23:25:21] <TsundereNoises> Urchin[emacs]: but a ring is cute too

[23:30:03] <Sxem> ive never seen a villain that wants to destroy all life on earth by dumping chlorine gas into the ozone layer
[23:30:03] <ButterNoodle> :|
[23:30:17] <Sxem> youd think thered be a movie like that by now
[23:30:32] <ButterNoodle> Sxem: chemicals confuse people
[23:30:53] <darkwitch> the ozone layer is currently residing inside Nanobot's house
[23:31:06] <ButterNoodle> next thing u know people would be huffing chlorine to cure covid... wait they kinda did that
[23:31:38] <isekaijin> Sxem: How much chlorine would you have to dump to actually destroy a significant part of the ozone layer? Not that this would normally trouble screenwriters.
[23:31:50] <ButterNoodle> good think I am hording bleach... my whites will be whiter for the zombie apocalypse
[23:32:11] <Bco1981> she likes pigs

[23:42:13] <Bco1981> ButterNoodle: while watching that anime, at the begining when the mc bumps is head, and she scans it to look for aneurysms. i thought, that woulf be nice to get a scan to check for that... few months later i get 4 scans. in 2 weeks.
[23:42:27] <ButterNoodle> yea
[23:42:42] <ButterNoodle> not for free from a cute alien cat girl in heat
[23:43:13] <Bco1981> here for free yes... but NOT some cute aline cat girl in heat.
[23:43:20] <Bco1981> anime*
[23:43:30] <ButterNoodle> *you always pat for it
[23:43:35] <ButterNoodle> pay for it
[23:43:44] <Bco1981> well true, i have paid for it.
[23:43:49] <Bco1981> over the years.
[23:44:48] <ButterNoodle> yea social healthcare just keeps people from getting Fd in the A for a million woolong hospital bill
[23:45:07] <TsundereNoises> you say "just" but that's the whole point
[23:45:11] <TsundereNoises> and it's a good goal!
[23:45:14] <TsundereNoises> but yeah
[23:45:15] <ButterNoodle> I agree
[23:45:40] <TsundereNoises> I do think we should have more healthcare administered by catgirls though
[23:45:52] <ButterNoodle> if all the healthcare systems in the US werent in fortune 50 companies... that would be a good start
[23:45:52] <xD-> hehe
[23:45:57] <Bco1981> Elon, work faster.
[23:46:05] <xD-> we do have a good system here
[23:46:12] <xD-> insurance for everyone
[23:46:22] <ButterNoodle> TsundereNoises: *all of it should be administered by catgirls for 100% effectiveness
[23:46:27] <ButterNoodle> xD-: where?
[23:46:46] <xD-> ButterNoodle: germany
[23:46:55] <TsundereNoises> admission to nursing school and medical school comes with free nekomimi genetic alterations
[23:46:58] <ButterNoodle> yea.. its not bad there..
[23:47:12] <TsundereNoises> I mean, we can have some cute catboi nurses too
[23:47:13] <ButterNoodle> preventive care and minor issues are ez
[23:47:35] <Bco1981> these Strong Zero do have a kick in them. not even done with one and i am starting to feel it.
[23:47:37] <ButterNoodle> TsundereNoises: I support that also.. catboi/girl equality
[23:47:54] <TsundereNoises> preventative care is so much more cost effective, but it's hard to justify the cost personally if you think you can get away without going to the doctor
[23:48:04] <TsundereNoises> but it's big savings at the societal level
[23:48:16] <ButterNoodle> I just wish I got more for what I spend on insurance... like a sponge bath by a cute cat girl at a quarterly checkup
