[19:08:09] <Nintendo> Should files be closed after merely checking for their existence:  if ((getline < "file") < 0) print "File exists."
[19:08:42] <Nintendo> Furthermore, shouldn't such existence-checking be frowned upon, given that getline might not return if it never encounters RS?
[19:26:21] <Nintendo> s/exists/does not exist/
[19:40:45] <emanuele6> the GNU awk manual says that you should always use `close("file")', so yes.
[19:41:07] <emanuele6> Nintendo: that way of checking a file's existance is not pretty, yeah
[19:41:52] <emanuele6> for regular files, that should not be a problem because `getline' will return anyway once it reaches EOF
[19:43:01] <emanuele6> but for pipes, that could be a problem (and other problem with using this kind of check for pipes is that you will consume one line from the pipe)
[19:44:47] <emanuele6> s/other/an&/
[19:46:55] <Nintendo> That was exactly my line of thought.  Thank you for confirming.
[19:47:24] <Nintendo> But now checking file existence becomes a bit of a pain ;)
[20:02:19] <e36freak> i mean you can always system() a test command
[20:02:25] <e36freak> not ideal because forking but
[20:03:06] <e36freak> if you're doing a lot of that kind of thing perhaps you want a shell instead

[20:19:18] <emanuele6> yes, you can use `system("test -f file")' as long as "file" is not the content of a variable
[20:19:53] <emanuele6> if "file" is the content of a variable, consider using perl instead of awk
[20:41:37] *** Joins: wstrnr (~wstrnr@user/wstrnr)
[20:46:15] <e36freak> there are ways to safely escape a variable for system(), to be fair
[20:46:25] <e36freak> but again, if you're doing this a lot, awk is probably not the best choice
