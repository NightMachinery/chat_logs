[04:32:24] <Roey> they had met at a party that my sister had thrown at her place, like, six years ago. Fallen in love, gotten engaged, lived together at a house (That /he/ bought, curiously enough, under his name and not both of theirs..)
[04:32:33] <Roey> our cousin is femle
[04:32:34] <Roey> female
[04:32:53] <Roey> and this news just made its way to me yesterday.
[04:32:53] <ButterNoodle> I love female cousins
[04:33:02] <Roey> same
[04:33:04] <Roey> I have plenty
[04:33:12] <Roey> male cousins - only one
[04:33:14] <ButterNoodle> I cant find mine on facebook anymore, I think she noped out
[04:33:17] <Roey> second cousins - plenty of both
[04:33:23] <Roey> ah
[04:33:45] <ButterNoodle> she got a nasty divorce from a cop

[04:45:30] <MootPoot> With usb 4  being standard and usb c only 
[04:45:42] <MootPoot> I'm wondering 
[04:45:53] <MootPoot> If we're going to get a shit mix of port types now 
[04:46:01] <MootPoot> Now only with usb c 
[04:46:22] <MootPoot> Oh yeah here you have 4 usb c ports on this laptop 
[04:46:44] <MootPoot> But you can only use one to charge and one for display and one for charging something else and one for network 
[04:46:59] <MootPoot> I wonder if we're ever going to get thunderbolt on every port

[04:50:50] <Roey> ^^^^^^^^^^^^
[04:50:59] <Roey> doh, off by one
[04:51:25] <Roey> MootPoot: if we get usb4 on enough ports, they can work like thunderbolt
[04:51:35] <Roey> erm. I htink they need to be certified thunderbolt though.
[04:54:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Unless they fix the spec, I want neither thunderbolt nor usb4
[04:55:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> At current time, functional IOMMU isolation isn't mandatory.

[11:24:52] <Arcorann_> I can try a couple of things (no guarantees)
[11:25:07] <KatrinValerie> You should only do that when you are pentesting for the site owners
[11:25:15] <KatrinValerie> not that anyone would notice
[11:25:53] <KatrinValerie> but technically it's illegal to do such things in Germany and when you access German servers German law applies
[11:25:59] <KatrinValerie> But there is really little to no enforcement
[11:26:16] <KatrinValerie> I mean, the newspaper would have to catch you and figure out your identity to fine you
[11:26:35] <KatrinValerie> oh wait it's also a crime on top of that
[11:26:54] <KatrinValerie> I wonder if they can even sue for breach of contract
[11:27:10] <KatrinValerie> but they could definitly report computer sabotage
[11:27:43] <Arcorann_> What about if you look at the cached copy from Google? --> https://12ft.io (note: haven't tried this before)

[16:15:13] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: your idea is a firmament
[16:15:58] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: there is proximity to that concept sure
[16:16:12] <DunceCotus> but it is not to be explained away with God did this or God did that
[16:16:21] <DunceCotus> this is a naturally-forming firmament if anything

[16:18:03] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: it may be better to call it a cell than a bubble
[16:18:25] <DunceCotus> but I think if you could see 'overhead' our world it would be like a bubble amongst other bubbles, a bubblebath
[16:18:36] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: a cell can heal its cell wall
[16:18:46] <DunceCotus> however even a cell can burst and spill its contents
[16:19:43] <DunceCotus> the Full Body of the Earth however is NOT the cell we are within, it is something upon the cell has formed
[16:19:50] <amigojapan> Right DunceCotus but cells are closer to spheres than a bubble of soap
[16:20:09] <DunceCotus> cells are not spherical
[16:21:00] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: the cell we are in is sort of spherical
[16:21:06] <DunceCotus> or round anyway
[16:21:12] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: they are also not flat
[16:21:18] <DunceCotus> its just flattened at the bottom cause it has grown out of the Full Body of the Earth
[16:21:58] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: when a cell comes up against a hard surface it can conform its shape to that surface
[16:22:05] <SpiritOfSummer> this guy told me the earth was flat and tried to prove it with an Einstein theory
[16:23:07] <DunceCotus> SpiritOfSummer: I think we will have to discard Einsteinian relativity physics
[16:23:23] <DunceCotus> though sure it 'works' but only for certain applications

[16:29:09] <DunceCotus> JesseDesu: they switch to CGI
[16:29:18] <SpiritOfSummer> and the very first thing I thought was 
[16:29:36] <SpiritOfSummer> 'that's not true, people have circumnavigated the planet, like Amelia Earhart' which was the only story I had on tap
[16:29:44] <SpiritOfSummer> and I was shocked to realize that story ended in her disappearing completely
[16:29:53] <JesseDesu> CGI wasnt a thing when they first did it in the 1960s
[16:29:57] <SpiritOfSummer> and the very time I tried to prove the Earth round without NASA imagery was a complete failure

[16:30:03] <SpiritOfSummer> and I was certainly interested
[16:30:12] <JesseDesu> mootpoot
[16:30:13] <JesseDesu> cum
[16:30:19] <SpiritOfSummer> DunceCotus: I think it's worth the initial questioning, but in general, I went on to completely reconclude that it is in fact round
[16:30:25] <DunceCotus> JesseDesu: they used special effects either way
[16:30:28] <SpiritOfSummer> Science is far too interconnectd for it to be otherwise. 
[16:30:47] <DunceCotus> SpiritOfSummer: a lot of round world science also works for flat
[16:30:54] <darkwitch> the moon is round
[16:30:59] <SpiritOfSummer> that might be true but there's factors besides science as well
[16:31:08] <DunceCotus> however 'rounders' are obsessed with gravity but it doesn't fit into their own equations
[16:31:19] <DunceCotus> and they have to make up shit like dark matter
[16:31:21] <DunceCotus> to make it work
[16:31:26] <SpiritOfSummer> DunceCotus: we'd be able to see the Burj Kalifa with a telescope if it was flat
[16:31:26] <JesseDesu> ok i am convinced
[16:31:38] <JesseDesu> the earth is flat for some people
[16:31:40] <SpiritOfSummer> DunceCotus: I'm sorry dude gravity is so damn real it's not even funny
[16:31:53] <SpiritOfSummer> it's by far the most solid astronomical theory
[16:32:01] <DunceCotus> SpiritOfSummer: hahaha
[16:32:02] <SpiritOfSummer> it adds up -perfectly- with what we see in the sky
[16:32:07] <SpiritOfSummer> yeah I'm laughin too man
[16:32:12] <DunceCotus> SpiritOfSummer: density
[16:32:13] <SpiritOfSummer> I got a lot more scientists behind me though
[16:32:17] <DunceCotus> fluid dynamics
[16:32:23] <DunceCotus> there's no gravity
[16:32:31] <SpiritOfSummer> DunceCotus: tell me what there is?
[16:32:41] <SpiritOfSummer> Electromagnetics right?
[16:32:44] <DunceCotus> yes
[16:32:50] <SpiritOfSummer> how do you explain the sky
[16:32:55] <SpiritOfSummer> what are we seeing up there
[16:32:56] <DunceCotus> the sky is a fluid
[16:33:17] <SpiritOfSummer> DunceCotus: no it's not
[16:33:25] <DunceCotus> with various layers or strata of fluids of various densities
[16:33:25] <SpiritOfSummer> how the hell do you not believe in atmospheric science

[16:33:47] <SpiritOfSummer> dude the entire theory of matter and atoms doesn't even work with that
[16:33:56] <SpiritOfSummer> do you not believe in elements or the periodic table
[16:34:07] <DunceCotus> SpiritOfSummer: I'm agnostic on the matter
[16:34:24] <DunceCotus> there's a lot in science that will necessarily be proven wrong or at least ill-conceived
[16:34:28] <SpiritOfSummer> amigojapan: I was referring to the elevators being busted
[16:34:29] <DunceCotus> that's how science advances
[16:34:52] <SpiritOfSummer> yeah I said at the beginning Einstein's science is probably far from perfect at this day in age
[16:35:16] <DunceCotus> SpiritOfSummer: I think the biggest problem is a lot of dogmas have emerged in the natural sciences
[16:35:23] <DunceCotus> this has caused stagnation
[16:35:45] <amigojapan> SpiritOfSummer: ah. They just had to restart the system. It worked in the morning
[16:36:14] <DunceCotus> science that has to rely on heavily politicised institutions like NASA.. isn't really science
[16:36:24] <DunceCotus> its more like a religious doctrine
[16:36:33] <SpiritOfSummer> honestly that's not even too far off
[16:36:57] <SpiritOfSummer> DunceCotus: My mom is a college professor in biology and nutrition so I'm faithful to a lot of scientific models that exist
[16:37:10] <SpiritOfSummer> but I'm also open minded to new knowledge that discredits old knowledge
[16:37:42] <Bco1981> as long as it actually makes sense
[16:37:50] <DunceCotus> SpiritOfSummer: models can work for a time, at a time, in certain context
[16:37:59] <SpiritOfSummer> if we got it right they work forever

[16:45:33] <SpiritOfSummer> 5% of flat earthers are onto something
[16:46:00] <DunceCotus> 95% of statistics are fun
[16:46:02] <JesseDesu> flat earthers think they're too cool for facts
[16:46:11] <SpiritOfSummer> I had this crazy theory that the Earth could be flat and round at the same time
[16:46:21] <SpiritOfSummer> think about black holes, if you go near them it seems to flatten out
[16:46:28] <SpiritOfSummer> anad then the universe itself becomes round instead
[16:46:34] <SpiritOfSummer> to you at least
[16:46:56] <listen_ers> no imitation shrimp dat i know
[16:47:00] <DunceCotus> well a lot of space imagery we are presented with features spherical bodies and flat discs 
[16:47:01] <SpiritOfSummer> so what if Earth looks round from space, but entering the surface flattens out the dimension and it actually is a whole plane, and the edges just don't make it to the spherical illusion you see in space
[16:47:28] <SpiritOfSummer> who can prove the theory I just said? not me
[16:47:36] <DunceCotus> SpiritOfSummer: interesting
[16:47:47] <DunceCotus> SpiritOfSummer: the problem there is we do not have photos of round Earth
[16:48:18] <listen_ers> lets be real we benefit greatly from having seisomographs
[16:48:26] <DunceCotus> we have mockups, we have CGI, we have paintings etc
[16:48:43] <MootPoot> JesseDesu:  cum
[16:48:50] <DunceCotus> listen_ers: oh?
[16:48:50] <MootPoot> work just started
[16:48:54] <JesseDesu> mootpoot
[16:49:01] <SpiritOfSummer> MootPoot: the pokemon named 'Ekans' is snake backward
[16:49:03] <Bco1981> yes... because the many satelites up there constantly taking pictures of the multi-angled-flat-earth.... we don't have that... no.
[16:49:06] <SpiritOfSummer> MootPoot: and there's a slimy pokemon called Muc
[16:49:07] <SpiritOfSummer> not kidding
[16:49:25] <MootPoot> I dont really know much about pokemon
[16:49:27] <JesseDesu> DunceCotus, if you fire a cumshot at 17,500mph, it will come back and hit you in the back of the head
[16:49:28] * darkwitch likes slime
[16:49:28] <MootPoot> was never into the series
[16:49:31] <JesseDesu> because the earth is round
[16:49:31] <SpiritOfSummer> MootPoot: I didn't say you did
[16:49:33] <SpiritOfSummer> neither was i
[16:49:33] <listen_ers> allows us to study the interior of the planet
[16:49:37] <SpiritOfSummer> but there's a pokemon called cum

[16:49:39] <ButterNoodle> vagina slime
[16:49:40] <MootPoot> lol
[16:49:40] <MootPoot> ok
[16:49:51] <SpiritOfSummer> you need to know that man
[16:49:56] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: probably smells nice
[16:50:03] <JesseDesu> why didnt anyone addquote that
[16:50:14] <MootPoot> well, work just started
[16:50:14] <Bco1981> DunceCotus: you are gonna have to wait till spacex gets som upthere
[16:50:15] <ButterNoodle> I smell like gain and bounce
[16:50:15] <DunceCotus> JesseDesu: a cumshot impervious to heat?

[16:50:32] <SpiritOfSummer> you could just not and say you did

[16:50:42] <amigojapan> Ok wash for 31 minutes
[16:50:46] <listen_ers> you should segfault truth like that it doesnt reciprocat very well
[16:50:51] <amigojapan> Then dryer
[16:50:53] <ButterNoodle> DunceCotus: u ok?
[16:51:04] <ButterNoodle> or is this normal?
[16:51:12] <JesseDesu> delusional
[16:51:13] <SpiritOfSummer> ButterNoodle: this gentleman is a mild advocate for flat earth theories
[16:51:15] <DunceCotus> ButterNoodle: me doing me
[16:51:27] <ButterNoodle> oh are u a non-gmo antivaxxer?
[16:51:40] <SpiritOfSummer> we should make a vaccine for getting mad
[16:51:45] <SpiritOfSummer> if you get it you never get mad anymore
[16:51:52] <SpiritOfSummer> nobody likes to be mad
[16:51:58] <SpiritOfSummer> besides Eminem maybe
[16:52:08] <ButterNoodle> its called heroin SpiritOfSummer.. its effects only last a short time though
[16:52:13] <DunceCotus> ButterNoodle: not strictly, though I am critical of this vaccine push
[16:52:26] <SpiritOfSummer> ButterNoodle: give me some of yours
[16:52:40] <DunceCotus> having had bad outcome of having a vaccine (before covid)
[16:52:44] <Mare> I think getting mad is useful sometimes. But a lot of folks don't have a good prioritization about it.
[16:52:53] <DunceCotus> it isn't something I think we should be making mandatory
[16:52:57] <ButterNoodle> oic... so you do have critical thinking ability, just not concerning the geography of this planet
[16:52:57] <SpiritOfSummer> yeah I was just being silly
[16:53:11] <SpiritOfSummer> anger is natural and has it's uses
[16:53:12] <Mare> oh okay right
[16:53:20] <ButterNoodle> do you think mars is flat?
[16:53:25] <SpiritOfSummer> yea
[16:53:30] <SpiritOfSummer> it is dude
[16:53:32] <DunceCotus> Mars is detritus
[16:53:33] <Mare> like when your government screws you over and you need to be like, "hey, that's not right..."
[16:53:40] <ButterNoodle> oh
[16:53:43] <SpiritOfSummer> why do you think its red
[16:53:45] <ButterNoodle> we are the only planet?
[16:53:46] <SpiritOfSummer> its a penny
[16:53:58] <DunceCotus> ButterNoodle: we simply do not know yet
[16:54:04] <ButterNoodle> and all those martian porno's I've seen on brazzers is fake too I guess..
[16:54:15] <Mare> lol
[16:54:16] <JesseDesu> mars is a confectionary company in pennsylvania
[16:54:21] *** meroxmas is now known as mero
[16:54:28] <SpiritOfSummer> Mars invented the M&M
[16:54:36] *** mero is now known as evilmero
[16:54:37] <SpiritOfSummer> and that's how I mention both the rapper and the candy in the same conversation
[16:54:41] <SpiritOfSummer> separately from each other
[16:54:50] <Bco1981> SpiritOfSummer: wut?
[16:54:57] <ButterNoodle> mind blown
[16:54:57] <DunceCotus> Mars is possibly another bubble, albeit much smaller than ours, and plasmic
[16:55:03] <SpiritOfSummer> the chocolate company by the name of mars makes the M&M
[16:55:12] <SpiritOfSummer> and earlier I mentioned Eminem, the rapper that lives 1 town over from myself
[16:56:02] <Mare> I think there's one thing flat earthers kind of have going on, and that that we shouldn't take information for granted.
[16:56:07] <Mare> That being said, come on lol
[16:56:09] <Bco1981> i never noticed... M&M's is my drug
[16:56:14] <DunceCotus> yes the synchronicity machine has been overloaded recently
[16:56:24] <Bco1981> but the bag print confirms
[16:56:50] <ButterNoodle> DunceCotus: do you have airplanes?
[16:57:06] <ButterNoodle> and have you been on one.. as a passenger -not cargo
[16:57:11] <DunceCotus> ButterNoodle: you only inherited airplanes
[16:57:21] <DunceCotus> I were born in it
[16:57:44] <JesseDesu> a B-2 bomber can circle the earth with repeated aerial refueling
[16:57:47] <JesseDesu> its been done
[16:58:01] <DunceCotus> no-one has actually seen Earth's curvature
[16:58:10] <listen_ers> one thing though that fact is you are only an irc guy with this belief no one famous with actual product that makes me look them up because a peculiar belief(which is wrong like not believing the moon landing..)..
[16:58:11] <DunceCotus> what we have seen is misleading photography or special effects
[16:58:12] <SpiritOfSummer> yes I have DunceCotus
[16:58:12] <ButterNoodle> JesseDesu: what was that crew that use to keep nukes in the air?
[16:58:13] <JesseDesu> they take off from missouri, drop a load on afghanistan, and returns to base
[16:58:15] <Bco1981> JesseDesu: it magically teleported to the other side... several times.
[16:58:24] <MootPoot> B-2 (2020) or B-2(2021)
[16:58:26] <SpiritOfSummer> DunceCotus: when I looked across lake Michigan, I could see building tops, but not the shore
[16:58:35] <JesseDesu> butternoodle i forget
[16:58:40] <JesseDesu> those were B-52s
[16:58:42] <ButterNoodle> SpiritOfSummer: good luck
[16:58:51] <ButterNoodle> JesseDesu: for all time?
[16:58:51] <SpiritOfSummer> through a telescope, it was clear as day that the bottom 100 feet of each building was missing
[16:58:54] <MootPoot> I flew up in a helo once with the side door open for a heli tour
[16:58:56] <SpiritOfSummer> DunceCotus: commence your explanation for that
[16:59:04] <MootPoot> pretty clear curve
[16:59:04] <DunceCotus> SpiritOfSummer: that's not curvature, that's arcing light
[16:59:06] <JesseDesu> theres too much noise in the channel
[16:59:10] <SpiritOfSummer> complete bullshit
[16:59:16] <MootPoot> cream pie
[16:59:22] <DunceCotus> light does not move in a straight line -- nothing in nature does

[17:00:45] <ButterNoodle> *plump
[17:00:48] <ButterNoodle> with a fat cock
[17:00:52] <SpiritOfSummer> then again Goku barely ever did save earth
[17:00:52] <Mare> lol SpiritOfSummer
[17:01:08] <SpiritOfSummer> he saved Namek, Gohan killed cell, and Kid buu wasn't on earth
[17:01:13] <DunceCotus> nobody can see the curvature of the Earth
[17:01:19] <SpiritOfSummer> DunceCotus: I already did
[17:01:21] <Mare> Goku was mostly just interested in fighting...
[17:01:27] <SpiritOfSummer> the light moving in curved lines theory is completely false DunceCotus, drop that one
[17:01:28] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: I got flamed for that on reddit when it was a thing
[17:01:29] <DunceCotus> what you are seeing you are interpreting as curvature of Earth
[17:01:34] <DunceCotus> but it is actually curvature of light
[17:01:38] <SpiritOfSummer> nahhh
[17:01:43] <SpiritOfSummer> curvature of my dick
[17:01:57] <DunceCotus> Earth is like a Minecraft map

[17:03:15] <SpiritOfSummer> you pointed out science that was completely made up by flat earthers
[17:03:23] <ButterNoodle> kinda like the church of euthanasia
[17:03:30] <DunceCotus> all science is made up
[17:03:30] <SpiritOfSummer> at first I just thought you were kind of questioning things, DunceCotus
[17:03:38] <Mare> Well, I'm convinced. I better believe in a flat earth now. 
[17:03:51] <SpiritOfSummer> but no, you're making things up with a lack of experimentation or study, DunceCotus, unlike other scientists who 'made up' their science
[17:03:58] <DunceCotus> SpiritOfSummer: am I not?

All light curves upwards over very long distances. The Electromagnetic Accelerator has been adopted as a modern alternative to the perspective theory proposed in Earth Not a Globe.
[17:06:54] <DunceCotus> Sunrise and sunset happen as result of these upwardly curving light rays."

[17:08:16] <Mare> admittedly this guy is hurling more insults than I would have
[17:08:42] <Mare> DunceCotus, I acknowledge that's an idea. Probably a very wrong one, but it's an idea
[17:08:57] <DunceCotus> "A consequence of this paradigm of upwardly bending light is that the observer will always see the nearside (underside) of the celestial bodies. The below image depicts the extremes of the Moon's rising and setting. The image of the nearside face of the Moon is bent upwards around the Moon and faces the observers to either side of it.
[17:08:58] <DunceCotus> "

[17:10:54] <DunceCotus> there's way too much money and industry invested in Einsteinian physics, in heliocentric cosmology etc.
[17:11:03] <DunceCotus> because of that science has stagnated
[17:11:17] <DunceCotus> at least in terms of astronomy and physics
[17:11:19] <JesseDesu> having never flown into space, i can never know with my own eyes if the world is round.  i know that cameras are able to record images of things i know to exist.  i can then infer that if multiple cameras placed at different angles at high resolution are carried onboard a rocket that launches into space, there is very very reasonable chance that the orbital footage cannot be faked all at once in real time even with the best CGI
[17:11:52] <Mare> jesseDesu, so you're saying is you need to get rich and go to space.
[17:12:16] <DunceCotus> JesseDesu: it can be faked and is

[17:12:59] <DunceCotus> NASA and other space agencies aren't necessarily running a globe earth conspiracy, but they are trying to fake space/space travel

[17:18:33] <Mare> Well, the one report.
[17:19:23] <amigojapan> Ok the wash is almost done. Next is the dryer
[17:19:39] <Mare> and where does it say they have a black budget in the entire report?
[17:19:43] <DunceCotus> "For years, NASA has cited deficiencies within its financial management systems as a primary reason for not having the data required to oversee its contractors, accurately account for the full cost of its operations, and efficiently produce accurate and reliable information needed for both management decision making and external reporting purposes."
[17:20:02] <Mare> DunceCotus, so you're speculating?
[17:20:21] <DunceCotus> Mare: do you think something called "black budget" would leave a paper trail?
[17:20:30] <Mare> You're speculating.
[17:20:34] <DunceCotus> this is secret hoarding of money from federal funds
[17:20:40] <DunceCotus> its not going to be easily proven
[17:20:47] <Mare> This isn't evidence of that, though
[17:20:57] <Mare> Yeah, it's not easily proven. Until then, you've only got speculation.
[17:21:07] <DunceCotus> what it is evidence for is NASA can use the 'deficiencies' excuse to remain unauditable
[17:21:18] <DunceCotus> and because its NASA I guess they're allowed to do that
[17:21:59] <Mare> It could even be the reverse situation. Kind of like how poor people get a tax return, the IRS is like, "Let's just throw these guys a bone."
[17:22:03] <Mare> that was a joke

[18:23:53] <Sadale> Sxem, there's quite a few catches with 3D printed parts tho. The print quality is meh. It takes forever to print larger parts. And like 10% of prints would fail and requires manual intervention.
[18:24:04] <Sadale> Anyway as what death916 said, get one if you want. It's fun :3

[18:26:10] <death916> that hodl lights ofr maximum spooky
[18:26:15] <Sadale> if you make your own parts tho, having a 3D printer at your home helps a lot.
[18:26:18] <Sxem> maybe i could 3d print a better dpad that fits on top of my old dpad
[18:26:29] <Sadale> The part that you design often requires quite a few revisions until it works
[18:27:53] <Sadale> Sxem, doubt that it'd even work because the wall thickness can't be too thin and it'd be difficult to mount your dpad extention onto the existing dpad without thin walls. Designing a replacement d-pad may work tho.
[18:28:56] <Sxem> i am emulating ancient games on retroarch and most of them use dpad and not analog sticks, so i am really starting to hate my dpad, which i hardly ever used much before
[18:29:27] <Sxem> if i can remove the dpad without breaking it
[18:29:41] <Sadale> what kind of gamepad you've got?

[20:38:48] <MootPoot> they usually cap at 120-130w
[20:40:15] <Bco1981> i should get a 2,5" usb 3.0 for a 2-4TB ssd for backups... would go faster.
[20:40:43] <MootPoot> no
[20:40:54] <MootPoot> 4tb ssds are at a price premium
[20:40:57] <MootPoot> get multiple 2tb ones
[20:41:03] <MootPoot> and get them usb 3.2 gen 2
[20:41:19] <MootPoot> unless you have only SATA ssds in your pc I guess
[20:41:50] <MootPoot> idk what is up with the prices but the price increases per gigabyte like 20-30% when you go past 2tb here
[20:42:06] <Bco1981> Chia
[20:42:32] <MootPoot> tbh chia hasen't had a impact here
[20:42:37] <MootPoot> as far as I can see
[20:42:45] <MootPoot> maybe like 5% or so change in the last few months

[20:45:52] <MootPoot> ass
[20:46:01] <ButterNoodle> nos and good pulls on ebay for cheap
[20:46:14] <ButterNoodle> 10$ a tb
[20:46:46] <ButterNoodle> if I get hard up for space I may fill another cage with 4tb'ers
[20:47:08] <Bco1981> $267 for 2TB usb3.1gen2 2.5" ssd
[20:47:08] <MootPoot> tbh Bco1981 why not just get a 4tb or 8tb hdd, plug into router as a NAS
[20:47:13] <MootPoot> and use that
[20:47:14] <ButterNoodle> winter is cumming.. I could use the extra heat
[20:47:43] <Bco1981> MootPoot: i like having a dedicated external drive for OS backups.
[20:48:00] <MootPoot> that would be a dedicated external drive tho
[20:48:00] <Bco1981> easy to suddenly take with me to a friend or a friends parent.
[20:48:12] <MootPoot> just unplug from router and take with you?
[20:48:29] <ButterNoodle> I really like the idea of those little portable ssd's
[20:48:35] <Bco1981> the speed of the hdd is slow
[20:48:35] <MootPoot> idk buy what you want, I dont see reason for a backup drive to be an ssd
[20:48:46] <MootPoot> I have a 500gb portable ssd I use for that
[20:48:55] <MootPoot> but backups are all spinning iron
[20:49:07] <Bco1981> currently i have a 2.5"hdd over usb2...
[20:49:15] <MootPoot> rip
[20:49:20] <Bco1981> i want faster
[20:49:26] <MootPoot> smack that bitch in a usb 3.0 enclosure
[20:49:28] <MootPoot> for 10 bucks
[20:50:30] <Bco1981> it's a 1TB and it's running out of space
[20:50:51] <MootPoot> tbh if its a old 1tb drive I doubt it can saturate even a usb 2.0 connection
[20:50:51] <Bco1981> so a 2TB ssd in usb3 would be a nice upgrade
[20:51:01] <Bco1981> oh it does
[20:51:06] <MootPoot> I got a 5tb usb 3 hdd for like 80 usd
[20:51:33] <Bco1981> backups about 60MB/sec, restores about 48MB/sec
[20:51:58] <MootPoot> yeah, my 5tb new external 2.5" can do like 100/80
[20:52:05] <MootPoot> 2.5" are limited
[20:52:11] <Bco1981> yep
[20:52:17] <Bco1981> and i don't want 3.5"
[20:52:24] <Bco1981> so ssd 2.5" it is
[20:52:25] <MootPoot> how much does it cost you
[20:52:38] <MootPoot> why get a 2.5" tho
[20:52:41] <Bco1981> 267$ i see a 2TB for
[20:52:52] <MootPoot> in a ssd you dont even need to stick to hdd form factors
[20:53:26] <Bco1981> 2.5" is more reliable in transfer speed, as they don't get as hot as nvme drives
[20:53:46] <MootPoot> is it?
[20:54:02] <MootPoot> idk, if the transfer is fast, heat dissaption dosent really matter imo
[20:54:08] <Bco1981> those pcie 4.0 they throttle very fast
[20:54:33] <Bco1981> speeds above 1GB/sec is spike/burst... not sustained
[20:54:35] <MootPoot> true
[20:54:42] <MootPoot> but you're not using pcie 4.0 tho
[20:54:56] <MootPoot> checking amazon, seems like fastest usb external ssds are like
[20:55:00] <Bco1981> pci3.0 has same problem
[20:55:01] <MootPoot> usb 3.2 gen 2
[20:55:22] <MootPoot> 10gbit transfer but rated for 1000MB/s on the box for the device itself
[20:55:59] <MootPoot> what is the fastest port on your laptop?
[20:56:26] <Bco1981> i think it has 2 of the 3.2 gen2 10gbit
[20:56:26] <MootPoot> I assume its probably usb 3.2 gen 2; amd computers wont have thunderbolt yet
[20:57:03] <Bco1981> 1 10gbit, 2 usb-c
[20:57:30] <Bco1981> no there was a 2nd 10gbit on the other side

[21:09:53] <Bco1981_2> lol
[21:11:31] <Bco1981_2> looks lik nvme external are more expensive then 2.5" external ssd
[21:11:54] <MootPoot> ofc
[21:12:07] <MootPoot> nvme far outclasses anything external
[21:12:14] <MootPoot> even nvme external is a joke tbh

[21:15:20] <MootPoot> then why does it have to match 2.5"
[21:15:32] <MootPoot> you can get smaller with the same speed

[21:16:37] <MootPoot> okay
[21:16:47] <MootPoot> so you're not buying a premade external ssd
