[03:56:48] <Shapeshifter> Does someone know a tool that I can use to stream audio from a linux laptop to an android phone with sufficiently low latency that it's possible to watch videos? I use snapcast in a different setup over ethernet and for music only and it's great, but I tried it for this usecase and the latency is several seconds. Can't find a way to fix it.

[21:59:25] <teraflops> think^
[21:59:31] <noze> yes, the main reason I'm using wayland over X is because scaling just works

[22:00:36] <TheDcoder> Microsoft has a good X server now, so it's not an issue anymore
[22:00:46] <teraflops> iirc they do wayland
[22:00:46] <TheDcoder> and honestly I didn't think Wayland could work over WSL

[23:48:12] <Spiker01> I have now installed KDE Plasma. But I also use i3wm. There was a following problem: Now instead of the Gnome/Gtk theme, i3wm uses icon themes, window styles and cursor skins from kde plasma. I didn't manually add anything to i3wm autoload or GNU/Linux autoload. How do I get i3wm to use GTK skins instead of kde skins again? Previously, before installing KDE, i3wm used a GTK theme. The system has Gnome installed.
