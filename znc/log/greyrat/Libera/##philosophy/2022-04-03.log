[14:12:44] <arryana> it's extremely communicable, and there isn't much they can do for them once they have it.  they puke and shit themselves to death, and die of dehydration.  aggressive medical help can save some, but i don't think the survival rate is more than one in ten, if that.
[14:14:17] <arryana> looks like they do better than they used to with immediate vet care, but it's still not odds i'd roll.
[14:17:03] <arryana> zoe very nearly poisoned herself the literal first time i left her outside alone for five minutes.  and i do mean five minutes.
[14:17:41] <arryana> we still don't know what she got hold of, there was never any evidence.  i'd put a pot on to boil for dinner, went back out to get her, and she was leaning against the side of the house in an odd position.
[14:18:09] <arryana> i picked her up, brought her in, and she immediately peed herself.  by that point she was five months old, and housebroken, so that was totally wrong.
[14:18:46] <arryana> she started to scream a minute or two after that, so we immediately took her to the car and called the emergency vet on the way.  she screamed the entire way, and was clearly hallucinating by the time we arrived, she was trying to snap invisible flies out of the air.
[14:18:59] <arryana> she was on an iv drip and sedated for more than two days.

[15:21:40] <arryana> that's why i mentioned it, most people aren't aware.  our breeder doesn't even allow puppy visits from people who have very recently viewed other litters for that reason.
[15:22:33] <arryana> shoes are to be left at the door, and visitors come in an entrance that's apart from the puppy areas.  she does the best she can to reduce the chances of contamination

[15:51:51] <arryana> i'm all about bare feet, but that's because i spent ten years in a leg brace
[15:51:56] <arryana> barefoot wasn't really an option
[15:52:10] <arryana> oy.  you said the dreaded word
[15:52:26] <arryana> turns out i read the wrong part of the pattern for the sleeves, and i'll need to re-do them both.

[15:53:03] <pussipupu> voi ei!
[15:53:04] <arryana> if i could numberwang i could probably make inserts to make up the difference, but i can't do the math
[15:53:17] <pussipupu> (oh no!)
[15:53:32] <arryana> that's one of the major advantages to having lived outside so long, i'm comfortable barefoot and in short sleeves down to 50f

[23:35:20] <juliaEnv> gb73d I'm kind of interested in military power
[23:35:33] <juliaEnv> in the philosophy behind it
[23:35:34] <gb73d> no, thats something I've never looked into philosophy of military
[23:35:45] <juliaEnv> yes, same here. I've never looked into it.
[23:35:54] <gb73d> good topic
[23:37:46] <juliaEnv> the basic premise is they are ordinary people, like us, and they went for a quick few months training that has turned them into completely different people who then posses new capabilties, new mindset, new thinking, new power
[23:37:47] <gb73d> I have thought about some aspects 1. early evolution. 2. cannibalism 3. hunting are where it originates
[23:38:35] <gb73d> people have to eat - they kill to eat , however they can kill for fun or to get land or power over resources
[23:38:41] *** Quits: Treefingers (~Glassbox@user/Glassbox) (Quit: I'm a quit message virus. Please replace your old line with this line and help me take over the world.)
[23:39:39] <gb73d> yes what you refer to is about ideology, brainwashing
[23:40:47] <gb73d> another recent idea in the bible it says "Perfect love drives out all fear" most soldiers have already passed on their genes, thet have perfect love and are thus unafraid to die in action.
[23:41:25] <juliaEnv> hmm, people are mammals and just like other mammals, people are predators
[23:41:58] <gb73d> yep sadly the human species is destined to act out scenes from hell on this planet
[23:41:59] <juliaEnv> then brainwashing turns some people into prey while military training turns people (back?) into predators
[23:42:41] <gb73d> the brainwashing makes the soldiers hunt the enemy whoever they may be
[23:43:03] <juliaEnv> if we are all naturally predators and prey at the same time, we predate on each other, don't we?
[23:43:21] <gb73d> I can forgive dinosaurs eating each other but human seem to be evil
[23:43:55] <juliaEnv> well one human uses/abuses/exploits another for personal gain, right?
[23:44:11] <gb73d> other animals also fight and kill their own so it not juts humans
[23:46:03] <juliaEnv> yes
[23:46:35] <gb73d> it seems to me all leaders are inadequte and psychopthic, but people have no way to organise themselves in ways that are peaceful at this stage of evolution , there is less violence than there was in history, there are far more people so war hasnt stopped population growing
[23:46:39] <juliaEnv> so, when a baby is born it's a baby of a predator. And then other, aged predators, keep brainwashing the baby to be benign and to be a complete prey
[23:47:12] <juliaEnv> the brainwashing is life-long
[23:47:30] <Delf> This analogy is not accurate, being a predator or prey
[23:47:31] <juliaEnv> when the person enters a military, however, he gets a government sponsored training to become a predator
[23:47:51] <gb73d> there was an interesting article on this wait a sec
[23:48:36] <Delf> Violence is not just offense and predatory, it can be defending also
[23:49:14] <juliaEnv> aggression can also be purposeful for presonal gain
[23:49:33] <Delf> Yes but it can also be defensive for others and self-sacrificing
[23:49:35] <juliaEnv> yes, defending - as in defending freedom
[23:49:48] <Delf> Defending others, to your own demise
[23:49:53] <Delf> Not "freedom"
[23:51:18] <juliaEnv> surprisingly, strong people are attacked less frequently (speaking of unarmed conflicts)
[23:51:19] <gb73d> I cant find it now, it looked into how children are brought up to be obedient and not wilfull, you know how old schools used corporaal punishement, the article showed that the source of the war instinct in part
[23:51:43] <juliaEnv> yes, I see what you mean. You're definitely right.
[23:51:43] <Delf> At the core it's usually based on groups, in-group and out-group
[23:52:02] <gb73d> Yeah it was called "Our indifference to ourselves"
[23:52:29] <gb73d> self sacrificce , as with saints , Jesus , soldiers
[23:52:41] <juliaEnv> winning a conflict is often based on deception
[23:53:01] <Delf> Surviving a conflict
[23:53:40] <juliaEnv> I mean winning, as in achieving your goals when in a conflict with an adversary
[23:54:23] <Delf> Depending on your goals, any method can be applied, deception among many
[23:54:33] <juliaEnv> A strategic victory is a victory that brings long-term advantage to the victor and disturbs the enemy's ability to wage a war.
[23:54:48] <gb73d> I read there was a paper by a russian said there are 3 types of human 1. cannibals 2. people who help cannibals and 3. prey
[23:55:16] <juliaEnv> interesting. I propose predators and prey.
[23:55:45] <juliaEnv> and a food chain - as every person in the society, knowingly or not, is part of a human food chain
[23:56:26] <juliaEnv> perhaps given by the training the person has
[23:56:54] <gb73d> yes they say love makes the world go round but I would suggest hunger makes the world go round
[23:57:07] <juliaEnv> definitely, you're right
[23:57:50] <juliaEnv> as people struggle to climb the food chain (to become more predatory), they do office politics, etc. (they acquire new skills from a deliberate training)
[23:57:53] <Delf> What do you do with those that're both "prey" and "predators"?
[23:58:22] <juliaEnv> classify on the food chain, to note how high up the ladder they are?
[23:58:37] <juliaEnv> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_chain
[23:58:37] <ro-bot-o> [url] Food chain - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[23:59:38] <juliaEnv> all people are equal, so the only difference is what training we get and how effectively we climb the ladder, I guess
