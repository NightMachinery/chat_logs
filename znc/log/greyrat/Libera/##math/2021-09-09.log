[00:00:17] <mh_le> it can only be positive negative if you define those non-strictly
[00:01:16] <Inline> why then split into something like something <0 and on the other hand say 0<= something else
[00:01:21] <zacts> ok, can you have the law of the excluded middle as an axiom, but also not recognize it for just a subset of your mathematical system?
[00:01:24] <Guest44> Z-module oh i'm dumb. The definition says "nonzero"

[00:03:43] <zacts> kind of like use strict in perl is the default, but for a subset of your code you can turn that off
[00:03:56] <zacts> can you do something like that with the law of the excluded middle?
[00:04:14] <Inline> so technically it is neither but in the mindset of the people it is more positive than negative....
[00:04:19] <Inline> lol
[00:04:24] <zacts> lol
[00:05:27] <jpearse> strangely enough. the book 'diamond logic' which does away with the excluded middle actually has a section where it addresses the paradox of the boundary involving whether zero is positive or negative
[00:05:56] <Simplar> Why many books on limits have tasks where they deny to use L'Hospital rule?

[00:28:34] <buster> jpearse, the fundamental way to prove a sentence "not P" is to prove that P implies a contradiction. that's the case even in intuitionistic logic and mathematics. it's also fine to prove "not not P" by deriving a contradiction from "not P". the only problem is that "not not P" doesn't imply P, in the absence of the law of excluded middle.

[01:32:32] <qergle> so you have a polynomial ring, then some subset of that that satisfies certain properties is an ideal
[01:34:16] <qergle> if your ideal is generated by some single f in R[x] then all the elements in your ideal ate of the form gf where g ∈ R[x]
[01:34:48] <qergle> i don't think elements eat, so let's assume i meant "are"
[01:35:25] <alphamule> Kind of old school, but was thinking of how 2-input, 1-output binary gates fall into two nice categories.
[01:35:38] <qergle> this particular ideal is called principal because it can be generated by 1 poly.
[01:36:17] <qergle> if it's generated by some finite group (greater than 1) it's no longer principal, but is called finitely-generated.
[01:36:53] <alphamule> AND/NOR/OR/NAND/... are all assymetrical, but XOR/XNOR/0/1/... are all symetrical, and how you can not get the first group from the latter.

[05:32:49] <Guest44> PlanckWalk oh do they mean like this: f'(x) = 0 -> xcos(x) + sin(x) = 0 -> xcos(x) = -sin(x) -> x = -tan(x) ? The left side is linear here
[05:32:56] <PlanckWalk> Right
[05:34:08] <Guest44> and I guess because we got this form of f'(x) = 0 by just algebraic manipulation so we can graph both sides of the equation. Where the graphs intersect are those points where the equation x = -tan(x) is true.
[05:34:26] <Guest44> is that right?

[13:58:26] <FriendlyPigeon> Since B ∩ C ⊆ B and B ∩ C ⊆ C, that means that A ∪ (B ∩ C) ⊆ A ∪ B and also A ∪ (B ∩ C) ⊆ A ∪ C. Because A ∪ (B ∩ C) is inside of A ∪ B just as it is A ∪ C, that means A ∪ (B ∩ C) ⊆ ((A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C)).
[13:58:59] <FriendlyPigeon> For A ∪ (B ∩ C) = (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C)

[16:21:34] <pikapika> now you can divide it by that quadratic and solve the quotient to get the remaining roots
[16:22:13] <buster> you're given that 1+i is a root, and it follows that 1-i is another, and then that z²-2z+2 is a factor. Then you can do long division to find the other. But the thing you have started to do using roots of unity is another reasonable way to find the other factor, too.

[17:04:59] <[itchyjunk]> I am asked if |z-4| >= |z| is a domain or not.
[17:05:22] <[itchyjunk]> it simplified to z >= x and this is neither open nor closed so it's not a domain
[17:05:34] <[itchyjunk]> if anything it = is it can't be a domain anyways right?

[17:08:49] <buster> it's {z: Re(z)<=2} and is closed (but not compact)

[17:31:28] <buster> yes, you could probably assume they meant -pi to pi, but it's not a fair question as written, so everybody should get 1 mark or 0 marks for it. i'd leave it blank and comment that it is a sketch of the empty set

[20:21:21] <qergle> say A is the event that die #1 exceeds the target and B is the event that die #2 exceeds the target. You're after P(A ∪ B)
[20:21:39] <enoq> yeah, makes sense
[20:22:40] <cherim> Usually you just multiply probailities that first die is too small and that the second is too small
[20:22:43] <enoq> so let's say that one has the probability of 55% and the other one 65%
[20:22:46] <qergle> now, maybe doing this semi-concretely will help elucidate the general approach
[20:23:00] <cherim> Fewer names for techniques

[20:29:17] <qergle> ok, but here an outcome is of the form (x,y) where x=die 1 and y=die 2
[20:29:30] <qergle> that's why we have 400 of them
[20:29:37] <enoq> ah, I misunderstood
[20:30:08] <enoq> so basically if one die exceeds it, the other one is irrelevant
[20:30:20] <qergle> for my event question, yes
[20:30:21] <enoq> then there's also the case where both are the same
[20:30:38] <enoq> so there are 5 cases where both die rolls are the same

[20:30:58] <enoq> and 5*20 for each one?
[20:31:14] <enoq> so 2*5*20 +5?

[20:31:59] <enoq> ah I see
[20:31:59] <qergle> because that case is in both of the 5*20's
[20:32:18] <qergle> so how many ways are there where they both exceed 15?
[20:33:17] <enoq> first though that comes to mind would be 5*5
[20:33:27] <qergle> and that's right
[20:33:34] <enoq> all permutations kinda
[20:33:50] <enoq> so we subtract that
[20:34:00] <qergle> so the total number of outcomes favorable to at least one die exceeds 15 is: 2*5*20 - 5*5 = 175 (out of 400) is 7/16
[20:34:35] <qergle> which is the same as realizing that P(A ∪ B) = P(A)+P(B)-P(A ∩ B)

[20:35:47] <qergle> in other words, not getting either die exceeding the target is the same is both dice not exceeding the target

[20:38:28] <qergle> 2*15*20 is wrong
[20:38:40] <enoq> since we don't disregard the second die, right?
[20:38:45] <qergle> what's an example of both dice being at or below the target?
[20:39:02] <qergle> (14,8) is one, right?
[20:39:10] <enoq> so we want to multiply by 15 instead of 20 I think
[20:39:22] <enoq> since the failing cases of either die go from 1-15
[20:39:26] <qergle> right, there are 15^2 outcomes favorable to that
[20:39:49] <enoq> ah, you're right

[22:57:35] <Guest44> If A and B are matrices, is it true that ||AB|| <= ||A|| ||B|| ?
[23:00:03] <qergle> no
[23:00:26] <int-e> What is ||A||?
[23:00:28] <qergle> it depends on which norm
[23:01:00] <Guest44> https://i.imgur.com/SaxzM39.png is what i'm trying to do
[23:01:27] <int-e> "induced matrix norm"
[23:01:45] <Guest44> hmm..what is that..
[23:01:50] <int-e> hrm. anyway that term suggests submultiplicativity.

[23:02:06] <int-e> Guest44: well it's a term from the problem, so you should know
[23:02:18] <qergle> what does that wording mean?
[23:02:33] <int-e> (I should know too... but I had forgotten.)
[23:03:19] <Guest44> I think I found it https://i.imgur.com/dCa4r1j.png
[23:03:48] <int-e> but what the problem asks is far more direct
[23:04:12] <int-e> (far more direct than submultiplicativity, that is)

[23:07:10] <drobi> If i want to compute the locus of points X such that |AX|-|A'X| = 2a and |AX|-|BX| = 2b, this is the intersection of two arms of hyperbolas that share a focus. Is there a way to do this without introducing the 4 roots of the intersection of 2 hyperbolas?

[23:08:09] <qergle> he's pretty much linked it no?
[23:09:12] <cherim> For which norm does ||AB|| <= ||A|| ||B|| not hold?
[23:09:25] <qergle> he linked ‖A‖ = sup{x≠0} ‖Ax‖ > ‖Ax‖

[23:09:48] <qergle> the last part is my addition
[23:10:04] <Guest44> yeah, trying to figure out how to use it to prove what they want
[23:10:28] <cherim> I don't understand what you say. What is the norm? Why do you have >= in RHS?
[23:10:38] *** Quits: hanif (~hanif@gateway/tor-sasl/hanif) (Quit: quit)
[23:11:00] <int-e> qergle: you're mixing the two variants in (3.6)
[23:11:17] <cherim> I always thought that |ABx| <= |A| |Bx| <= |A| |B| |x|, each time by definition of norm
[23:11:18] <int-e> qergle: but yes, it's pretty direct
[23:11:48] <qergle> no, i just forgot a denominator
[23:12:02] <int-e> cherim: there are many norms on matrices as a vector space; not all of them are sub-multiplicative.
[23:12:03] <qergle> he linked ‖A‖ = sup{x≠0} ‖Ax‖ ≥ ‖Ax‖/‖x‖
[23:12:13] <qergle> crapola
[23:12:25] <qergle> ‖A‖ = sup{x≠0} ‖Ax‖/‖x‖ ≥ ‖Ax‖/‖x‖
[23:12:32] <int-e> cherim: for the induced norm, yes, that's how it works.
[23:12:59] <cherim> OK
[23:13:02] <qergle> that gives ‖Ax‖ ≤ ‖A‖‖x‖
[23:13:31] <qergle> and ‖AB‖ ≤ ‖A‖‖B‖ follows quickly thereafter
[23:14:03] <int-e> it's still a distraction from the problem
[23:14:11] <Guest44> howd you get the inequality from that qergle
[23:14:22] <qergle> by defn of sup
[23:15:03] <Guest44> oh right cause its like a max
