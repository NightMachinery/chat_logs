[00:38:14] <technomancy> yeah, the only reason we have :test-paths or whatever in project.clj currently is in order to use lein's test runner. if you replace that with kaocha then you should put it elsewhere.

[04:20:01] <RendySurvage> I'm new to clojure and I'm having an issue that I cannot quite figure out how to ask the right question. I thought I may be able to share my output to find help.
[04:20:08] <RendySurvage> http://ix.io/3vB6
[04:21:54] <hiredman> you are using a version of unify from before this bug fix https://github.com/clojure/core.unify/commit/a5f60d74e1df61291535be43dab7bd2f2eaceb32
[04:22:29] <hiredman> (from 4 or so years ago)
[04:25:07] <RendySurvage> How do I update that package? I tried lein deps but maybe I need to brush up on lein
[04:26:06] <hiredman> you'll have a project.clj file that specifies the versions of all the libraries you are using directly
[04:26:32] <technomancy> wow the readme of that thing
[04:32:22] *** Quits: libertyprime (~libertypr@124.197.60.232) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[04:33:36] <RendySurvage> I'm a little confused (no surprise). I added expectations and lein-autoexpect from the clojars website. They are current versions in my project.clj and my profiles.clj
[04:34:11] <RendySurvage> Could it be a conflict between expectations (project.clj) and lein-autoexpect (profiles.clj)?
[04:35:04] <technomancy> RendySurvage: `lein deps :tree' should be able to point out any conflicts you might be running into
[04:35:04] <RendySurvage> project.clj http://ix.io/3vB9
[04:35:19] <RendySurvage> thank you!
[04:36:00] <technomancy> you should put unify in your project.clj tho if you need a specific version
[04:36:08] <technomancy> *core.unify, whatever
[04:37:56] <RendySurvage> datomic-free "0.8.3331" was the issue
[04:38:13] <RendySurvage> It's the most current version on my deps but that's it
[04:39:29] <RendySurvage> Likely from the old trial of datomic that I was using forever ago in my profiles.clj overriding datomic-free
[04:40:07] <RendySurvage> My code is all over. Pulling myself together. Thanks for the help.
[04:41:38] <technomancy> haha np

[18:56:58] <selfsymmetric-mu> My friend is writing a function in Julia that has the property f(a,b) = f(a)(b), so it can be called in curried and uncurried form. Some kind of heinous ad-hoc partial application via parametric polymorphism. 
[18:58:10] <selfsymmetric-mu> You could do the same thing pretty easily with Clojure's multi-arity functions if you were allergic to `partial`.
[18:59:39] <ridcully_> i dont know julia, but i'd assume, that is how julia works?  e.g. the same as haskell
[19:02:48] <selfsymmetric-mu> I also don't know Julia but I think it doesn't work that way. Haskell has automatic syntactic partial application. Julia does not. If you have a two-param function and pass one param you just get an error.

[19:57:22] <EdwardIII> just playing with some dumb ideas. what would be the most simple way to have something that could receive email over the internet? local postfix + MDA, and have clojure read + manage that? 
[19:57:36] <EdwardIII> anyway you could do all of it in java/clojure?

[20:15:39] <ridcully_> do you need this for testing or do you actually want to run a mail server for the world?

[20:51:48] <EdwardIII> ridcully_: the latter, thinking of making a toy mailinator-type thing
[20:58:46] <EdwardIII> ridcully_: but it'd be ingress-only

[22:11:47] <raek> EdwardIII: receive email should be easy. your domain needs an MX record that points to your server listening on port 25.
[22:12:54] <raek> some MTAs (don't remember if it was sendmail or postfix) supports having a ~/.forward file which can pipe the email to an arbitrary command
[22:13:07] <ridcully_> yeah or use procmail
[22:13:17] <raek> you'll receive plenty of spam, of course
[22:13:21] <ridcully_> but then i guess you also want to configure all the local parts?
[22:13:49] <ridcully_> i dont know about any MTA in java, that is rock solid.  i only know about greenmail for testing
[22:14:22] <ridcully_> if in doubt it rather use postfix (or whatever), back the local-parts via some external data storage
[22:14:38] <ridcully_> then you can hopefully steer all that stuff just via some DB from the outside

[22:36:47] <jeaye> Setting up your own postfix is anything but simple.
[22:38:13] <jeaye> I've been running my own postfix + dovecot + procmail + rspamd setup for a decade. Finally getting it working properly, and removed from all shit lists, and not treated as spam by Google and others, is a lot of work.
[23:12:28] <sobel> when i started using postfix, it was hands-down the simplest MTA that could compete with sendmail
[23:12:59] <sobel> i also remember fondly concluding nginx made way more sense than apache2
