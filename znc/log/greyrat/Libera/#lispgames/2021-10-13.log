[00:44:14] <skeemer__> hello all, what lisp languages are you using to develop games? 
[00:44:39] <skeemer__> i was reading practical common lisp and wanted to try a little bit 2d game dev is there some basic tutorial i can find online ot follow step by step?
[00:45:21] <technomancy> skeemer__: guile, fennel, racket, clojure, CL, and "make up your own lisp" are the most common
[00:46:54] <skeemer__> technomancy, ok thanks what about the second question? 
[00:47:08] <technomancy> skeemer__: no idea; last time I used CL was 2004 or so
[00:47:30] <skeemer__> technomancy, do you use guile and fennel now? 
[00:47:39] <technomancy> skeemer__: mostly just fennel
[00:48:05] <technomancy> most of the love2d documentation translates pretty naturally to fennel; https://fennel-lang.org/see
[00:48:13] <technomancy> tutorials and stuff
[00:48:49] <skeemer__> technomancy, ok so basically fennel is a scheme that translates to lua, correct me if i am wrong ...
[00:49:18] <technomancy> not scheme but yes, it produces lua as its compiler output
[00:49:55] <skeemer__> technomancy, ok so it is not a scheme... but then it can use basically all third party lua modules right ? 
[00:49:59] <technomancy> yep
[00:50:23] <technomancy> the URL I posted above is a decompiler so you can paste anything from (for example) http://www.osmstudios.com/tutorials/love2d-platformer-tutorial-part-1-the-basics and get a Fennel version
[00:50:32] <technomancy> it won't be idiomatic but it'll work
[00:50:50] <skeemer__> technomancy, yrah thanks a lot, any other good resources on fennel? are there books or other things?
[00:51:50] <technomancy> no books but https://fennel-lang.org/tutorial and https://fennel-lang.org/reference and https://github.com/bakpakin/Fennel/wiki/Cookbook
[00:52:06] <technomancy> skeemer__: we got a pretty active channel in #fennel if you have more questions
[00:52:16] <skeemer__> thanks a lot technomancy

[01:17:52] <borodust> skeemer__: for CL have a look at vydd's Sketch or borodust's trivial-gamekit
[01:18:17] <borodust> https://github.com/vydd/sketch
[01:18:33] <borodust> https://github.com/borodust/trivial-gamekit
[01:20:19] <skeemer__> thanks a lot borodust

[01:44:56] <skeemer__> is anybody here using emacs with SLIME and evil mode? i find it frustrating to switch back to the repl when the cursor is not aligned to the prompt... i have to do "GG" to go to the end of the cursor
[01:45:06] <skeemer__> any smart way to use it with evil mode ? 
[01:46:48] <Jach> skeemer__: If you're a bit adventurous you can also use the SDL2 bindings: https://github.com/lispgames/cl-sdl2 I've been making a pygame-esque helper lib with it with some examples but haven't published them yet since it's pre-alpha/I might change everything, but if you want I can upload a zip.
[01:56:36] <skeemer__> Jach that would be interesting sure!
[01:59:10] <skeemer__> Jach, anyway sketch and trivial-gamekit are the most similar things to pygame in common lisp ? 
[02:21:36] <Jach> skeemer__: both of them are quite a bit higher level than pygame, so I don't really see them as similar
[02:24:17] <skeemer__> higher level? so they should be simpler
[02:26:25] <Jach> skeemer__: Anyway, here's the zip: https://www.thejach.com/public/lgame-examples.zip
[02:26:57] <skeemer__> thanks a lot tomorrow i am going to explre it!!!
[02:26:59] <skeemer__> thanks 
[02:32:13] <Jach> Yeah, easier to get started. Compare the 4 lines of code for trvial-gamekit's getting-started in the readme, to do the same in my framework you'd need like 30-40 lines of code.
