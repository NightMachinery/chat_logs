[01:16:40] <Nanobot> snake: Are you submitting all the hidden fields the login form has? Including any CSRF tokens (which you'll have to fetch from the HTML, not hardcode into your script)?
[01:17:16] <snake> Nanobot, no i was just guessing as to which things are required ;-; i am mimicking what i see in the chrome tools tho
[01:18:22] <snake> so i have to visit the login page, download it, find any and all CSRF tokens somehow, and then create the whole request with all the right fields and keys and things in it
[01:18:38] <snake> how do you do this, seems like insanity
[01:18:50] <snake> i mean i was a web dev and we never had this kind of CSRF token thing
[01:19:08] <snake> if you posted to our endpoints using netcat it would work without much effort xD
[01:20:35] <Nanobot> snake: I custom-wrote a scraping framework which, yes, does all of that. It fetches the HTML, generates a DOM from it, and implements the HTML rules for form submission logic, among other stuff.
[01:20:53] <snake> sugoi
[01:21:18] <snake> i can't just script this, i need to roll up my sleeves and go full sicko mode
[01:23:16] <Nanobot> CSRF tokens are a security feature that basically ensures that you can't post stuff unless you can also read the pages in the same context. The way it works is the server generates a random security token that's stored server-side for your browser session, and it output a scrambled version of the token into the form. You just need to submit that same scrambled token when you do the form submission, which proves that you're in a position to read the pages 
[01:23:16] <Nanobot> and not merely in a position to force a user to make post requests.
[01:23:42] <snake> i see
[01:23:52] <snake> thanks!
[01:23:58] <snake> i give up
[01:24:16] <Nanobot> There are probably general-purposes scraping frameworks out there that you could use.
[01:24:22] <Nanobot> *general-purpose
[01:25:02] <snake> hmm

[08:52:32] <ButterNoodle> uhhhhhhhhh
[08:52:38] <ButterNoodle> idk was my answer
[08:52:51] <ButterNoodle> *only a normie would say anime girl
[08:53:35] <amigojapan> What do otaku say for "anime girl"?
[08:53:45] <wroathe> Now I've entered the stage with this Saint Seiya anime where there's a sunk cost fallacy going on. I'm not enjoying the final few episodes at all. They've essentially fallen into that anime troupe where the bad guys mess with the heros a bit, the heros are confused, the heros snap out of it and fight the bad guys, the bad guys grand stand forever and a minute about how no human could ever defeat them, and 
[08:53:50] <ButterNoodle> thats not the issue
[08:53:51] <wroathe> then there's a series of announced attacks back and forth while the bad guy continues grandstanding, and then finally the heros play their big trump card in a seemingly desparate situation
[08:54:05] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: that license plate is a test..
[08:54:53] <ButterNoodle> its a "ship girl" also known as a boy that looks like a girl in a sailor outfit from a kancolle doujin

[10:15:16] <S_T_A_N> Cool
[10:15:35] <amigojapan> I got 3 matching numbers
[10:15:46] <amigojapan> Out of 6
[10:16:09] <Zoidberg> what's the price for 4 matching numbers amigojapan?
[10:16:27] <amigojapan> Zoidberg: let me check
[10:16:41] <MootPoot> cock
[10:16:54] <MootPoot> amigojapan:  what's the spiciest thing you can get in japan
[10:17:39] <Zoidberg> wasabi!!
[10:18:22] <MootPoot> I said this earlier
[10:18:30] <MootPoot> but now I'll say it with more severity
[10:18:44] <MootPoot> I wish solar panels were like 35% efficiant already
[10:18:57] <amigojapan> Zoidberg: seems 7400 yen
[10:18:58] <MootPoot> imagine what we could do if we got it to 50%
[10:19:28] <Zoidberg> how much efficient are they now?
[10:19:44] <Zoidberg> that's nice amigojapan 
[10:19:48] <MootPoot> the absolute best ones currently available on the market to buy
[10:19:53] <MootPoot> are about 21-22%
[10:19:57] <amigojapan> MootPoot: Zoidberg is right when it comes to spicy things of Japanese origin
[10:20:08] <MootPoot> hrm
[10:20:19] <MootPoot> I've had wasabi though
[10:20:33] <MootPoot> its strong..but its not spicy in the same way really
[10:20:42] <amigojapan> Yup
[10:20:53] <MootPoot> I dont enjoy it
[10:20:55] <amigojapan> It hits the nose
[10:21:00] <Zoidberg> wow, just 22%?
[10:21:04] <amigojapan> I enjoy it
[10:21:12] <MootPoot> its like somebody took a mix of garlic and mint paste and shot it up my nose
[10:21:15] <Zoidberg> damn, what about wind mills MootPoot?
[10:21:31] <MootPoot> dunno about windmills
[10:21:42] <MootPoot> thermal power plants are about 30-35%
[10:21:49] <MootPoot> car engines are 20-30%
[10:22:07] <MootPoot> hydro is pretty high up there
[10:22:13] <MootPoot> 80 something I think
[10:22:46] <amigojapan> Zoidberg: I have always wondered if it is possible to make electricity with the power of waves in the ocean
[10:22:54] <Zoidberg> windmills theoretically can go upto 59% they say
[10:23:31] <Zoidberg> there's even better and cleaner way amigojapan which you won't believe it
[10:23:36] <Zoidberg> it's water!!
[10:23:42] <MootPoot> solar is already approaching cost effective prices
[10:23:44] <MootPoot>  tbh
[10:24:11] <MootPoot> if we could get the current prices with even an extra 5 or 10% efficiency

[14:51:38] <Publios> amigojapan,  speaking of weebdom. I saw someone making an annoying comment on tiktok. a japanese girl did a funny tiktok about onichan saying it isn't sexual (which it isn't) and then someone commented blaming weebs for making it sexual. that's not fair, it is anime and manga that made onichan sexual, not weebs
[14:51:39] <senti> already loving it
[14:51:54] <Publios> weebs just ran with it
[14:51:54] <senti> Publios, I'm a weeb

[14:52:40] <senti> I'm a weirdo
[14:53:30] <amigojapan> Publios: it's literally just "big brother
[14:53:52] <Publios> amigojapan,  right, I know the word itself is normal but it was anime and manga that made it perverted for some, not weebs
[14:54:08] <Publios> I had never heard of the big brother crush until sword art online a number of years ago
[14:54:13] <Publios> and now I've seen it in a ton of anime
[14:54:39] <senti> amigojapan: if I ever find a wife, I need a one-liner. Something to prepare my woman for me. Amigo, what would be a good one-liner for my future wife?

[15:14:08] <MootPoot> yeah but at 16 hours a charge
[15:14:09] <death916> a 15k one would only charge my phone luje 2.h times

[15:14:21] <MootPoot> and also I have a second bank

[15:15:08] <MootPoot> so for a macbook air that's 2.2 or so charges after accounting for losses

[15:27:57] <amigojapan> !c hipster
[15:27:58] <ImoutoBot> amigojapan: In the 21st century, a hipster is a member of a subculture that is defined by claims to authenticity and uniqueness yet, ironically, is notably lacking in authenticity and conforms to a collective style.
[15:29:03] <MootPoot> amigojapan:  glamping is basically "you buy multiple thousands of dollars of gear and haul it all to the campsite to make your campsite as close to home-feeling or residencial as possible, then you rip it all down after 2 days and go home, leaving the stuff in storage for a year"
[15:29:04] *** Joins: lastonestanding (~lastonest@p2e5dc57b.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)

[16:37:50] <sentionics> I had both of my covid shots in april and may
[16:38:09] <Sadale> depending on your political stance. If you're pro-democracy, yes, life would certainly be changed. But if you aren't political or pro-government, life doesn't changed much really. Plus the protests/riots are gone, which's actually a nice thing to us.
[16:38:44] <Publios> Sadale,  interesting. 
[16:38:51] <Publios> that sounds about what I'd expect

[16:40:27] <amigojapan> Nice brb prpldmn 
[16:40:53] <Publios> Sadale,  I guess that's how they get us in the end. I'm no different than you, just to be clear. and I'm also very cynical about 'political freedoms' but then again governments can easily erode our personal ones slowly as long as they keep our present focus happy

[17:13:48] *** Quits: jess (~jess@libera/staff/jess) ()
[17:14:01] <theholyduck> second of all trump spent literally his entire presidency breaking the rules of twitter and facebook
[17:14:11] <theholyduck> they gave him crazy leaway
[17:14:33] <theholyduck> Publios:  they only banned him when he started calling for violence in the streets
[17:14:47] <theholyduck> Publios: which seems like a reasonable stacne to take with a politican
[17:14:56] <amigojapan> Publios: freedom of speech does not mean you can say anything anywhere. It just means the government can't stop you
[17:15:05] *** Joins: jess (~jess@libera/staff/jess)
[17:15:09] <theholyduck> amigojapan:  i mean. even then. most countries do not have unlimited freedom of speech
[17:15:25] <theholyduck> and calls for violence is generally not one of the things allowed
[17:15:45] <theholyduck> in the us. the standard is a bright line standard where you ahve to say something that IMEDIATLY causes violence
[17:15:58] <theholyduck> but even the us extremely lenient free speech laws is not entirelly allowing you to make a call for violence
[17:16:08] <amigojapan> True theholyduck but Facebook could have banned him any time. The government did not make them do it
[17:16:14] <theholyduck> amigojapan: oh definitly
[17:16:15] <Publios> theholyduck,  all of those arguments are just useful excuses to censor other things Trump and people who follow him say
[17:16:31] <Publios> Trump didn't actually support an overthrow of the US government
[17:16:38] <Publios> he was dangerously close
[17:16:57] <theholyduck> Publios:  maybe/maybe not. but he was throwing gasoline on the fire every chance he got
[17:17:01] <Publios> facebook, twitter, and youtube are all obvious election influencing platforms
[17:17:04] <Publios> and they know it
[17:17:13] <Publios> so they banned people that influence elections the way they dislike
[17:17:16] <basuotoko> amigojapan san, konbanwa.
[17:17:17] <theholyduck> Publios: sure but by the time they banned him the election was long over.
[17:17:18] <Publios> in 2016
[17:17:34] <theholyduck> Publios: Publios  like the ban happened after the storming of the capitol
[17:17:44] <theholyduck> when his words led to violence
[17:17:47] <Publios> theholyduck, yeah, but it was still an effective way to end his powerful voice in the future
[17:18:16] <theholyduck> Publios:  i mean at this point trump has shown he cant be trusted with a twitter account
[17:18:16] <Publios> I'm more speaking of what happened post-2016 election
[17:18:22] <Publios> and all the deplatformed folks
[17:19:34] <amigojapan> I hope biden wins again
[17:19:40] <theholyduck> i hope biden doesnt run again.
[17:19:48] <theholyduck> and we get some younger better democrat
[17:19:49] <theholyduck> :P
[17:20:11] <Publios> Trump never called on people to use violence and he disavowed it. he was irresponsible but to act as if he pushed people to it is a bit much. I think he's partially responsible but really
[17:20:14] <Publios> banned from twitter?
[17:20:16] <Publios> and fb?
[17:20:52] <Publios> I think his tweets and comments about the election being stolen caused people to do this
[17:20:54] <Publios> that's true
[17:20:55] <theholyduck> Publios:  did you hear his speech at the rally that day?
[17:21:02] <Publios> yeah
[17:21:06] <amigojapan> Publios: other normal people have been banned for less
[17:21:16] <theholyduck> he literally said "walk down to the capitol" and "you will never take back our country with weakness"
[17:21:17] <Publios> amigojapan,  and many others haven't been banned for worse
[17:21:21] <theholyduck> Publios: sure he didnt LITERALLY say
[17:21:25] <theholyduck> go  storm the capitol building
[17:21:32] <theholyduck> Publios:  but clearly thats the subtext
[17:21:40] <Publios> theholyduck,  you can storm a building without hurting people
[17:21:49] <Publios> that happened many times during the George Floyd protests
[17:22:02] <Publios> like the seattle capitol building
[17:22:48] <Publios> and if in fact all those people think the election was STOLEN
[17:22:50] <theholyduck> Publios: i mean.. those stormings still involved violence.
[17:22:52] <Publios> and democracy was over
[17:22:57] <Publios> they did very very little
[17:23:03] <Publios> if you really think about it
[17:23:14] <Publios> if 70 million people think the election was stolen and democracy in america is over
[17:23:21] <Publios> what do you think will happen next?
[17:23:39] <amigojapan> Publios: the losers always cry
[17:23:39] <theholyduck> Publios:  they did very little be cause anyone they wanted to lynch or whatever managed to get out of there in time
[17:23:51] <theholyduck> amigojapan:  losers generally dont insist the election was stolen though
[17:24:01] <Publios> they did in 2016
[17:24:11] <Publios> they said russia stole the election in favor of trump
[17:24:13] <Publios> via various means
[17:24:22] <theholyduck> Publios:  i think the term we settled on was interfered
[17:24:24] <theholyduck> in the election
[17:24:29] <amigojapan> Many people said "trump is bit my president
[17:24:30] <theholyduck> proving they interfered enough to tip the scale is hard
[17:24:46] <Publios> theholyduck,  yeah, just like it is hard to prove that 'widespread fraud' existed
[17:24:54] <theholyduck> Publios: heres the difference though
[17:24:56] <Publios> 2016 and 2020 is the same thing
[17:25:05] <theholyduck> theres multiple bipartisan reports. and independent investigations
[17:25:09] <theholyduck> showing that the russians DID infact
[17:25:10] <theholyduck> interfere
[17:25:14] <theholyduck> in the election
[17:25:17] <theholyduck> WITH the support of the trump campaign
[17:25:27] <Publios> the last point isn't a fact
[17:25:38] <theholyduck> read the unredacted muller report
[17:25:42] <theholyduck> its a fact
[17:26:00] * Publios rolls eyes
[17:26:04] <theholyduck> bill barr censored the earlier versiosn so that it didnt look like that
[17:26:16] <theholyduck> but. if you read the latest version of it. it definitly draws that connection
[17:26:27] <Publios> yeah, the Trump campaign as an entity actively welcomed Russian interference
[17:26:27] <Publios> not
[17:26:43] <theholyduck> Publios: and activly gave the russians informtion on how to better interfere
[17:26:58] <Publios> lol
[17:27:15] <Publios> that's simply false
[17:27:21] <theholyduck> Publios: yes. they gave the russiasn their private polling data for what areas they needed support in
[17:27:34] <Publios> but obviously arguing this is pointless 
[17:27:51] <Publios> I concede
[17:27:52] <Publios> you win
[17:27:53] <theholyduck> Publios: my point now is. theres been like 60 lawsuits over the 2020 election and they have all been dismissed.
[17:28:06] <theholyduck> theres no evidence of anything theres no proof of anything. 
[17:28:30] <Publios> I personally do not think there was election influencing cheating from the democrats
[17:28:37] <theholyduck> the 2016 election and 2020 election are very different in how much evidence we have for any potential "theft"
[17:28:38] <Publios> just like I think the Russian collusion narrative was bullshit
[17:28:48] <Publios> except they aren't very different
[17:28:56] <theholyduck> Publios: im not sure that the russians did enough to tip 2016 or not. 
[17:28:59] <Publios> there is no hard evidence that russian interference won Trump the election
[17:29:05] <Publios> period
[17:29:13] <theholyduck> Publios:  sure. because its hard to prove the hypothethical the other way
[17:29:20] <Publios> just like there is no hard evidence that democrat fraud won biden the election
[17:29:22] <theholyduck> which is why everyone serious calls it "election interference"
[17:29:29] <amigojapan> Publios: didn't trump open his own web page to pay stuff? They can't ban that in normal circumstances
[17:29:30] <theholyduck> Publios: but there is no evidence of democrat fraud
[17:29:44] <theholyduck> where as there is a ton of evidence of russian interference
[17:29:48] <Publios> and there is no evidence that Russia won the election for Trump
[17:29:49] <amigojapan> To say stuff*
[17:29:55] <theholyduck> Publios:  theres evidence they tried though
[17:29:58] <Publios> sure
[17:30:05] <theholyduck> where as theres no evidence democrats tried to steal the 2020 election 
[17:30:12] <Publios> not yet
[17:30:17] <theholyduck> meanwhile there is a lot of evidence the gop and supreme court tried to steal the 2020 election
[17:30:22] <Publios> oh?
[17:30:29] <theholyduck> Publios: on the mail in ballot stuff
[17:30:40] <theholyduck> they set it up so that they could pull a 2000 florida
[17:30:50] <theholyduck> in any state that was close enough that mail in ballots of a certain type
[17:30:52] <theholyduck> could tip the election
[17:31:11] <theholyduck> supreme court ordered a certain category of ballot to be set aside and counted seperatly
[17:31:15] <theholyduck> so they could undo that count
[17:31:18] <theholyduck> if it mattered
[17:31:25] <Publios> I didn't know that supreme court justices were in the business of stealing elections
[17:31:30] <theholyduck> Publios: they did in 2000 
[17:31:37] <Publios> really?
[17:31:41] <Publios> that's new to me
[17:31:48] <theholyduck> Publios: all the best data we have is that al gore actually won florida in 2000
[17:31:57] <theholyduck> but supreme court schenanigans stopped the recount
[17:32:01] <Publios> but the supreme court wanted a republican to win?

[18:06:26] <Julius_Scissors> What issue? 
[18:06:34] <theholyduck> Zoidberg:  like he got out on a stupid technicality. but hes basicly admited to raping i think it was 19 women using that technique.
[18:06:57] <theholyduck> and they can all go after him for damages
[18:07:12] <Zoidberg> theholyduck: I think he is already broke now

[19:09:40] <Zoidberg> Rest is all concrete and bricks.
[19:10:17] <emmeka> yeah UPVC is used for like, windows, but what I meant is that framing for housing is usually wood, unless it's a particularly large building in which case it might be steel

[19:16:14] <emmeka> Zoidberg Red Green is another classic "rural life" comedy show like Corner Gas, but up in the northwoods of Ontario instead of the prairies.
[19:17:03] <emmeka> it's basically a series of sketches about the members of a fictional fraternal organization called possum lodge
[19:17:15] <Zoidberg> Nice, thanks for rec emmeka
[19:18:10] <Zoidberg> But man, Saskatchewan sure is flat. The other day some dude posted the place where they shot corner gas.
[19:18:21] <emmeka> depends where you go. most of it is.
[19:18:29] <emmeka> there's places like the Cypress Hills
[19:18:53] <emmeka> where I live is also flat, but you don't see it as much because there's actually trees
[19:19:05] <emmeka> it's noticeable on highways
[19:20:01] <Zoidberg> It‚Äôs an unusual topography for me.
