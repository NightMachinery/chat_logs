[20:10:12] <Amit[m]> E-man[m]: I don't think It's a Freedom.
[20:11:32] <E-man[m]> There are two things one is opensource and one is free software. Open source doesnt have to be free. But when we say opensource we generally mean FOSS. And in this case free means free as in freespeech. Not free as in 0 money
[20:11:42] <AryaBackup[m]> swartz and marak are different Amit

[20:15:04] <E-man[m]> Aaron was a pioneer and was an activist. There are lots of conspiracy theories due to his unusual death. But nothing is substantiated.
[20:15:21] <Amit[m]> Okay
[20:16:54] <E-man[m]> People say he was killed and he found something in MIT servers but there was no proof. I dont bear the burden of thinking if that is true or not, because even if he was right, I doubt I would've been able to affect any change and the day would keep moving.

[20:47:08] <Tor[m]> > He says the same thing as I said. That the price of opensource is that big ass corpos are gonna use your stuff and make themselves a lot of profit. That is the price. A lot of people may want to stop opensource for that reason but that will only help the corpos
[20:47:08] <Tor[m]> There are licenses that havw strickter rule for use by corporate use I don't remember it quite properly but iirc the website said it was the same reason so small devs cannot be fucked by big corpos 
[20:48:48] <E-man[m]> Tor[m]: Yep every Dev should learn about the different licenses. That is why I said opensource =/= free software
[20:50:15] <Tor[m]> free software is subset of opensource software
[20:50:45] <E-man[m]> Yep
[20:54:27] <Tor[m]> <E-man[m]> "People say he was killed and..." <- Tbh MIT didn't supported him in doing something which wasn't illegal (there was no monetary reason for him to do it) it was really a bad thing for MIT to do to him and the world but I think someone wasn't happy with Schwartz and pulled strings in MIT committee and fucked him over 
[20:54:40] <Tor[m]> Their silence killed him
[20:56:23] <E-man[m]> Yes this does seem like someone or a few people was irked by him. MIT in general really let him go after they asked him the data back and he gave it. It was the feds who saw this as an example where others may become motivated
