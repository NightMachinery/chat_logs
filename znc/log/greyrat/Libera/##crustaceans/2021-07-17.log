[00:05:26] <Geekingfrog> who can buy a house without the massive mortgage associated to it at 25, and still ask weather to sell it to fund something?
[00:13:38] <cb> tbh i might be able to afford a house
[00:13:45] <cb> well not with the fucking people from moving in from toronto
[00:14:10] <cb> people that cant afford a crack shack in vancouver moving to NB paying 50k over list price
[00:17:49] <geoffwozniak> Just saw a headline about places here going for 420K over asking
[00:18:05] <geoffwozniak> And not giant mansions or anything
[00:18:28] <Church> Yeah gonna be $350k-$400k for just an average starter house
[00:19:13] <geoffwozniak> I think avg. price is getting damn close to a million here
[00:21:17] <Geekingfrog> over asking = in addition to the asking price? so $500k listed price would sell at $920k ?
[00:21:27] <geoffwozniak> Yeah
[00:21:38] <Geekingfrog> omg, that's insane
[00:21:48] <geoffwozniak> 100K over asking is a common occurrence around the Toronto area
[00:21:52] <Geekingfrog> oÔ
[00:22:08] <Geekingfrog> How do you figure that out?
[00:22:09] <geoffwozniak> Little bungalows sell for 1.1 million
[00:22:28] <Geekingfrog> I have trouble imagining haggling over a house the same way you could haggle over a trinket or some clothes in some countries
[00:22:37] <geoffwozniak> People are buying houses without inspections just to avoid any delays
[00:22:56] <geoffwozniak> The market here is nuts
[00:23:11] <Geekingfrog> I feel it's an understatement
[00:23:12] <cb> geoffwozniak: i cant wait for them to realize they moved to new brunswick
[00:23:26] <cb> and the housing market everywhere is nuts
[00:23:36] <cb> my friend in NC had to build instead of buy because they couldnt find ANYTHING
[00:23:49] <Geekingfrog> and it's cheaper to build ?
[00:23:53] <cb> everything that didnt get snapped up were timebombs inspection wise
[00:23:55] <cb> in this case yes
[00:24:19] <cb> by timebombs i mean "the house inspectiton was bogus and done by a completely different kind of engineer"
[00:25:18] <riv> hey does anyone have any nice film recommendations?
[00:25:22] <geoffwozniak> Here's an example. And it's basically normal now: https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/toronto/article-buyer-scores-rare-renovated-townhouse-in-desirable-area-in-toronto/
[00:25:22] <buttsbot> Buyer scores rare renovated townhouse in desirable area in Toronto - The Globe and Mail
[00:25:43] <geoffwozniak> Asking: 1.3 million, sold at 1.5 million
[00:26:05] <geoffwozniak> On the market for a full 5 (!) days
[00:26:28] <Geekingfrog> how long does it take to fully complete the sale over there?
[00:27:06] <Geekingfrog> I just bought a flat, and between the time of offer and the final completion, it took over 6 months. It was a bit of an extreme case, but it's not unusual to take 3 to 4 months
[00:29:23] <geoffwozniak> Maybe a couple of months. I don't really know, but I don't hear of it taking a very long time
[00:30:56] <geoffwozniak> There's a place I can see from my apartment that I'm pretty sure sold twice during the pandemic.  When I checked it went for just under a million dollars. It's not a big place at all.
[00:31:56] <cb> iirc in US its a month or two, no idea here
[00:32:36] <geoffwozniak> My wife looked at some place that was for sale nearby just for kicks. Now she gets real estate listings and they are jaw-dropping in their insanity
[00:32:56] <geoffwozniak> Small condos going for 800K
[00:33:25] <geoffwozniak> cb: I've never bought a house, but from what I heas from friends it's about the same here
[00:33:34] <companion_cube> fuck fucking speculation
[00:34:31] <geoffwozniak> At $5K a month, it takes 16.6 years to pay off a million dollars. That's with no interest.
[00:34:51] <geoffwozniak> $5K a month is a good chunk of cash to throw at a mortgage
[00:34:54] <Geekingfrog> and no living expenses ?
[00:35:05] <Geekingfrog> ah, nvm, I see what you mean
[00:35:06] <geoffwozniak> Yup
[00:39:02] <geoffwozniak> I expect lots of people who are buying these homes are on 30+ year mortgages. If interest rates go up, it has potential to be ugly.

[17:07:40] <buttsbot> Twitter - thelaurenbales - Doctor Strange has to resolve a multiversal war bc his dumbass texted while driving once in 2016
[17:26:41] <Brekkjern_> That xargs post just illustrates the weakness of "everything is text" model...
[17:26:46] <Brekkjern_> At least the comments do
[17:26:49] *** Brekkjern_ is now known as Brekkjern
[17:27:11] *** Quits: leon (~leon@user/leon) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[17:28:19] *** Joins: leon (~leon@user/leon)
[17:55:43] <riv> i haven't read the post itself
[17:55:53] <riv> but i gathered the author just doesn't understand escaping?
[17:58:08] <Brekkjern> The problem is that you have to do escaping at all
[18:04:53] <riv> yes, you want one program (ls) to output a list of filenames and you want the other program (xargs/rm) to take a list of filenames
[18:05:50] <riv> but the way we serialize a list of filenames into text is wrong, and the way we deserialize is wrong too
[18:06:42] <riv> filenames can have anything in them (spaces, newlines, can start with -), and UNIX tools generally use \n as the delimiter. So there's that clash.
[18:07:13] <Brekkjern> Among other things, yeah
[18:07:13] <riv> I sent a patch to add \0 delimiter option to ls but they rejected it because "you shouldn't parse ls output"
[18:07:19] <riv> which other things?
[18:08:07] <Brekkjern> Well, the example in the thread of calling a file "-rf /" would make xargs execute "rm -rf /"
[18:08:27] <riv> oh wait, you can't have / in a filename
[18:08:36] <Brekkjern> Err, true
[18:08:49] <riv> I guess a directory named "-rf " could be trouble though
[18:09:31] <Brekkjern> But the point I was trying to make is that the it's dangerous to compose commands by building them as strings and then executing them
[18:09:57] <Brekkjern> There's no difference between the command itself, and the data it's supposed to operate at
[18:10:20] <riv> that's true!
[18:10:55] <Brekkjern> That's very different from an "ls | rm" in PowerShell for example, where the "ls" will generate actual objects that the "rm" command consumes
[18:11:31] <Brekkjern> Even if I chuck a few other commands in the middle, I will never really have to do the xargs hacks like that which could do unexpected shit
[18:15:12] <martian67|> <riv> I sent a patch to add \0 delimiter option to ls but they rejected it because "you shouldn't parse ls output"
[18:15:19] <martian67|> there are alternatives
[18:15:50] <Brekkjern> PowerShell is an alternative :D
[18:15:56] <riv> I am going to set up powershell
[18:15:59] <riv> I've wanted this for years
[18:16:18] <prussian> there is an extreme irony in that. gnu ls for instance can print shell/c-string style escapes
[18:16:21] <martian67|> enjoy that
[18:16:45] <riv> prussian, it does/can escape yeah.. but like, it's just awkward
[18:17:16] <prussian> I've learned to cope with the limits and just push it all in find instead.
[18:17:33] <riv> $ touch "$(printf "a\nb")"
[18:17:38] <riv> $ ls
[18:17:38] <riv> 'a'$'\n''b'
[18:17:45] <prussian> ya
[18:18:08] <riv> it's annoying though because the problems of shell bleed out into our build systems
[18:18:30] <martian67|> if your plan is to switch to powershell for your build system i wish you luck
[18:18:40] <riv> I'm not the only one whose had to remove spaces from a path just to get something to build for example
[18:18:47] <riv> martian67|, why?
[18:18:57] <riv> you not keen on powershell?
[18:19:08] <Brekkjern> We switched to PS for our build systems at a place I worked at before. Worked just fine.
[18:19:25] <riv> woah
[18:19:33] <Brekkjern> That said, the alternative was cmd since it was Windows :P
[18:19:41] <riv> haha
[18:19:45] <riv> well that's a different kettle of fish
[18:20:03] <Brekkjern> Indeed
[18:20:03] <riv> I dont have an opinion of powershell yet but it looks cool
[18:20:41] <Brekkjern> It's rather different than other shells I gather
[18:20:59] <Brekkjern> I like it, but it does have it's quirks and annoyances too
[18:20:59] <martian67|> there are ways to handle filenames safely in bash, but its slightly annoying https://dwheeler.com/essays/filenames-in-shell.html
[18:21:00] <buttsbot> Filenames and Pathnames in Shell (bash, dash, ash, ksh, and so on): How to do it Correctly
[18:21:42] <riv> \0 delimiters is the only correct way, right?
[18:21:48] <martian67|> no
[18:21:56] <Brekkjern> But I should pop down to the store. Haven't eaten anything yet :P
[18:22:00] <Brekkjern> *poof*
[18:22:08] <martian67|> the shell can handle escaping, but you have to do it correctly
[18:22:16] <martian67|> for instance, globbing is safe when done right
[18:22:37] <martian67|> never parse ls output
[18:22:39] <riv> oh yeah globbing is alright, although you have the edge case of no match to worry about
[18:28:09] <martian67|> its alright if you use ./ and nullglob
[18:49:00] <Brekkjern> The fact that my WiFi reaches down to the store is pretty neat as it shows how close the store is
[18:49:34] <Brekkjern> But at the same time... It means my phone connects to shitty WiFi when I'm down there and using internet is a pain...
