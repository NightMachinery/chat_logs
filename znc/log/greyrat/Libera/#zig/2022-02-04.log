[05:29:37] <cr1901> Maybe I'll write my own just for this app. Tho I'm not feeling up for it tonight lol- just querying
[05:47:50] <andrewrk> cr1901, sounds similar to what the zig compiler does for semantic analysis of switches
[05:50:48] <cr1901> andrewrk: Can you elaborate?

[05:53:53] <cr1901> Yes, RangeSet is similar to what I want.
[05:54:58] <cr1901> Basically I want... var full_range = Range { .. }; bad_range = RangeSet.init(..); good_range = RangeSet.init(..);
[05:55:08] <cr1901> and after I'm done calculating both range sets...
[05:55:48] <cr1901> assert(bad_range.intersect(good_range) == null) and assert(good_range.union(bad_range) == full_range)
[05:56:44] <cr1901> Oh and I'd want the bad/good_ranges sorted/each range non-overlapping
[05:56:54] <cr1901> andrewrk: would those be good additions to RangeSet stdlib?
[05:57:18] <andrewrk> tbh I don't really see a home for this in the std lib
[05:57:29] <andrewrk> I linked to the internal source of the zig compiler
[05:57:29] * cr1901 nods
[05:57:52] <cr1901> ahhh, well I'll look to that for inspiration then
[05:58:14] <cr1901> Since my Zig code... needs improvement still
[05:58:37] <andrewrk> you can probably simplify it since this impl needs to support the compiler's interval Value type rather than simply integers
[05:58:40] <cr1901> https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/master/src/RangeSet.zig#L13 right, I don't need this :P
[05:59:05] <cr1901> I do not need semantic info to sort integers lol. I can worry about making it generic later

[06:27:42] <cr1901> andrewrk: Btw, related to my cross-compiling woes... do you know any docs for cross-compiling LLVM (I want to create a windows/gnu Zig I can locally use on my Windows laptop). I know the bootstrap-zig script exists, but >>
[06:28:06] <andrewrk> why not download the one already made from ziglang.org/download?
[06:28:11] <cr1901> I have a setup (tm) and want exactly _one_ copy of LLVM source- the git repo I swap between branches- on my system
[06:28:51] <cr1901> Oh, I guess it doesn't matter if the Windows zig is GNU ABI or not
[06:29:09] <cr1901> I can "cross-compile" to it
[06:30:37] <cr1901> andrewrk: No good reason not to use the Windows one, other than "I still want to know how to cross compile my own LLVM for Zig/Rust and friends" :P
[06:33:45] <andrewrk> sounds like zig-bootstrap solves that problem for you?
[06:34:22] <andrewrk> the build script is just a handful of lines: https://github.com/ziglang/zig-bootstrap/blob/master/build
[06:35:15] <cr1901> https://github.com/ziglang/zig-bootstrap/blob/master/build#L27 <-- I don't think I noticed this. Maybe I can symlink to my existing llvm directory.

[06:54:41] <andrewrk> cr1901, what project are you working on?
[06:56:47] <cr1901> andrewrk: I have a set of scripts for compiling LLVM toolchains based on switching a few variables (LLVM_BRANCH, LLVM_COMMIT, etc). Zig and Rust are supported. But only native compile on Linux.
[06:57:14] <cr1901> Think "zig-bootstrap but optimized for any language build using LLVM"
[06:57:58] <cr1901> B/c I do do rustc dev and I hope at some point I do zig compiler dev as well

[06:59:14] <cr1901> For the zig build to build LLVM, I do something that generally looks like this: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/How-to-build-LLVM,-libclang,-and-liblld-from-source#posix
[06:59:42] <cr1901> But the build-llvm script is optimized so that "I have a single build-llvm script, not build-llvm-rust, build-llvm-zig, etc."
[06:59:47] <cr1901> Easier for me that way :P
[07:00:15] <cr1901> Well, I can't seem to convince LLVM to build a working cross-compiler using a single LLVM build script, so I'm kinda stuck lmao
[07:00:28] <nektro> the zig-bootstrap build script should generally work for rust too
[07:02:32] <cr1901> Hmmm okay that's fair. Would you be upset if my next response is "I want to understand what I'm doing wrong in my current setup just for the sake of knowing? :P"
[07:03:15] <cr1901> I'm not particularly attached to _my_ way of doing things, I just want to understand what I'm doing wrong before I swap it out w/ something better (such as zig-bootstrap/build as a general script)
[07:05:03] <nektro> no that's fair
[07:05:59] <cr1901> My build-llvm-toolchain script is a Justfile. It's not that complex, but I'm still trying to extract the relevant part into its own script
[07:06:24] <cr1901> since just has at least two types of vars (env and Justfile-internal) and I use both

[07:15:12] <cr1901> hold on one second, managed to screw up my build dir
[07:18:46] <cr1901> This'll related back to zig-bootstrap in a second. So my first attempt to cross-compile LLVM for zig was a command-line that looks like this (could be insufficient for other reasons): http://gopher.wdj-consulting.com:70/paste/2e4278b1-909e-470a-b3cb-f91f0aae8631.txt
[07:19:09] <andrewrk> not really sure what the purpose of all this is. there's a documented process to build llvm on the zig wiki if you need it, otherwise there's zig-bootstrap, and there are downloads of zig on the website
[07:21:23] <cr1901> Purpose is: I want to understand "why does zig-bootstrap work while my script doesn't?" before I swap out my homegrown "build LLVM toolchain for any compiler using LLVM mess" with a slightly modified "zig bootstrap"
[07:22:25] <andrewrk> you don't need a homegrown toolchain. just follow the wiki instructions and that build of llvm will work fine as the dependency for any project, including zig and rust
[07:22:47] <cr1901> https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/How-to-build-LLVM,-libclang,-and-liblld-from-source#posix You mean this page, correct?
[07:23:02] <cr1901> (for wiki instructions)
[07:23:04] <andrewrk> correct

[07:30:50] <cr1901> well, some of them

[07:39:22] <andrewrk> that's already done in the Build Instructions section. there are only 3 options
