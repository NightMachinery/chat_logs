[00:00:03] <nobyk> I don't dare look at what's in store for tomorrow
[00:00:05] <nobyk> I don't wanna know
[00:00:20] <Activ8> we are a small msp so the tickets ain't as complex as some other places
[00:00:35] <Activ8> I usually get tasked with setting up brand new tenants on our portal and migrating companies to 0365
[00:01:14] <Activ8> that includes dns records and validation
[00:01:21] <Activ8> ping, pong
[00:01:43] <nobyk> I used to do some of those too
[00:01:51] <nobyk> but I wanted more interesting work
[00:02:02] <nobyk> no not that
[00:02:07] <Activ8> or I set up AD remotely either on azure or onprem sometimes hybrid
[00:02:22] <nobyk> I was the help.. doing that
[00:02:37] <Activ8> I'm the go to guy for new roll outs (usually)
[00:02:50] <Activ8> I do 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th tier 
[00:02:55] <nobyk> I had to explain to every new senior that came along
[00:03:07] <nobyk> And I remember they'd try it differently
[00:03:10] <Activ8> I design new GPOs as well but that rarely comes up
[00:03:14] <nobyk> and they go back to the method we always used
[00:03:34] <nobyk> That was very informative, being a junior scrub
[00:03:39] <Activ8> typical ain't it
[00:03:41] <nobyk> don't reinvent the wheel and whatnot
[00:03:54] <Activ8> I never reinvent anything now I just do what I have to do and get paid
[00:04:03] <Activ8> I make no suggestions to improve that's someone elses job
[00:04:17] <Activ8> I train myself 
[00:04:23] <nobyk> And so I wanted to call the shots I guess, is what I mean by more interesting work
[00:04:34] <nobyk> So now I'm at a big af company, where I feel like I can't do shit
[00:04:47] <Activ8> I call the shots usually here, I'm practically my own boss until something doesn't go as it should
[00:05:08] <Activ8> we have 2 teams, a rollout team and a WFH team doing all the remote support via a ticket system.
[00:05:19] <Activ8> and then there's big boss man
[00:05:35] <nobyk> I get to make my own decisions and that's what we go with then
[00:05:37] <nobyk> people agree
[00:05:49] <nobyk> but then somewhere some person goes, yeah good but actually no
[00:05:50] <Activ8> I'm waiting for my boss to give me a company credit card
[00:05:55] <Activ8> he says I can have one
[00:06:37] <nobyk> what do you want it for?
[00:07:07] <Activ8> incase I need to order any extra things like licences or wfh stuff

[00:09:12] <Activ8> GPOs isn't too hard, we do a lot of configs now on the fly
[00:09:36] <Activ8> we have a baseline and then as time moves on do re-configs if required
[00:10:06] <Activ8> all of our companies we manage are different in requirements some more relaxed than others
[00:12:31] <nobyk> Please GPOs has got to be googling 90% of the time right?
[00:12:44] <nobyk> I'm sure you know stuff if you do it all day, or just often
[00:12:51] <nobyk> but most of it you google it right
[00:12:56] <nobyk> or look it up on microsoft docs
[00:18:14] <Activ8> nope I don't actually recall last time I googled.  I just look through the GPO and set it accordingly after doing testing in a test ou. 
[00:18:34] <nobyk> alright
[00:18:46] <Activ8> if something doesn't work I re-check the settings and then google but tbh I don't recall the last time something didn't work
[00:19:15] <Activ8> our networks are small-ish no more than 120 users on one of the networks but very rarely does something change with that company

[00:32:35] <Hunterkll> i know people who pick up part time TS jobs just to keep clearance active lol
[00:32:38] <sd> 13<B​lasteh> it's similar ish
[00:32:44] <Hunterkll> shit like security escort 
[00:32:51] <sd> 13<B​lasteh> you still need to stay on a job that requires the clearance or it expires
[00:32:52] <Hunterkll> basically "you need a TS to carry this briefcase for someone" shit 
[00:32:56] <Hunterkll> for like $10-15/hr lol
[00:33:28] <Hunterkll> but yea even having family in russia isn't actually a clearance blocker
[00:33:34] <Hunterkll> now holding a russian passport while you have a UK passport
[00:33:38] <Hunterkll> thaaaat'll be an issue
[00:33:39] <Hunterkll> lol
[00:34:45] <riff-IRC> we've been there, done that in the late 80s whilst we were testing out 486 dev hardware
[00:35:45] <riff-IRC> got our first 80486 devkit in December 1988- lemme tell you what, the security clearances on that thing were nothing short of top secret
[00:36:09] <Hunterkll> lol SF-86 has grown a lot since i first did mine
[00:36:15] <Hunterkll> in 2007 it was like, idk, 12 pages? 7? 
[00:36:18] <Hunterkll> now it's like 160 pages+
[00:36:32] <Hunterkll> thank god we do it electronically now
[00:36:33] <riff-IRC> heck, I think that there's still active NDAs on the 12/1988 devkit
[00:37:17] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> i kinda want to try workin at LLNL
[00:37:26] <Hunterkll> huh
[00:37:28] <riff-IRC> long story short, it looked like a good start, but it still had a long ways to go so we stuck with 80386 support for the time being.
[00:37:29] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> but that requires Q Clearance and shit
[00:37:30] <Hunterkll> 386's were made up until 2007 
[00:37:33] <Hunterkll> that's neat
[00:37:49] <Hunterkll> yea, look at TS standards, same clearance basically
[00:37:53] <Hunterkll> Q == TS 
[00:38:02] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> yeah it's just TS with special shit from what I found
[00:38:11] <Hunterkll> in fact if you have a TS you can usually transfer it over with a little legwork

[00:38:28] <Hunterkll> eh
[00:38:32] <riff-IRC> it wasn't until June 1989 that we officially announced that full 80486/80487 support would be shipped with GC3 by default
[00:38:35] <Hunterkll> once weed is legal federally it'll just be normal shit 
[00:38:35] <Hunterkll> lol

[00:38:47] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> ik amazon is pushing for it
[00:39:23] <riff-IRC> we'd come to that conclusion by March 1989, but couldn't make it public until after Comdex/89
[00:39:59] <Hunterkll> heh yea
[00:40:08] <Activ8> back was just making a coffee and a sandwich
[00:40:15] <riff-IRC> we also cut about 141K lines of code (across 12K files) out by fully deprecating 80286 support
[00:40:23] <Hunterkll> intel will tape off dev / ES silicon a year or two before announcements
[00:40:23] <Activ8> shouldn't be eating this late it's 10:10pm
[00:40:32] <nobyk> coffee?
[00:40:36] <Hunterkll> I've got a few ES 10gig nics that pre-date the chip's announcement by a year
[00:40:37] <Hunterkll> lol
[00:40:39] <nobyk> You're drinking cafeine now?
[00:40:43] <Hunterkll> they have bugs, but it works well enough 
[00:40:51] <nobyk> wasn't it like 9pm where you're at
[00:41:45] <riff-IRC> yea, we had full 80386 support on our 12/88 silicon, but some of the new 486 features were iffy at best.
[00:42:01] <riff-IRC> And it wasn't stable at rated clock.
[00:42:22] <Hunterkll> yep sounds like early ES stuff to me
[00:42:23] <Hunterkll> lol
[00:42:34] <Hunterkll> i've got an early ES itanium chip that won't work in any system 
[00:42:35] <nobyk> 10pm actually
[00:42:41] <nobyk> by now
[00:42:57] <nobyk> I could make a sandwich too. I have the materials
[00:42:58] <Hunterkll> one of the first gen ones with the x86 core on it 
[00:43:04] <Hunterkll> got one with an identical part number that works fine
[00:43:10] <Hunterkll> the ES chip does work in the system it came out of though 
[00:43:10] <riff-IRC> Our 01/89 silicon was miles ahead- that's when we found out that we were accidentally shipped an 05/88 kit labeled as 12/89

[01:59:15] <Hunterkll> eh
[01:59:25] <Hunterkll> set up a pull server, point all systems at it, central deployment, pretty easy to do
[01:59:32] <sd> 13<C​olour> I'm loving powershell right now it seems very much my sort of thing
[01:59:53] <sd> 11<H​otmess> the main advantage of dsc is the format for predifened shit
[01:59:54] <Hunterkll> we don't use it (we use things like SCCM, avanti, GPO, etc)

[02:00:48] <sd> 13<C​olour> My manager chatted about using GPO to install programs and I kinda felt like that was the wrong idea
[02:00:58] <sd> 13<C​olour> I see
[02:01:01] <Hunterkll> yea that's just wrong
[02:01:08] <Hunterkll> GPO to install programs should be used extremely sparingly
[02:01:17] <Hunterkll> only thing i've got GPO'd for "install" is defender ATP enrollment 
[02:01:21] <sd> 11<H​otmess> its deffo the old school way
[02:01:22] <sd> 13<C​olour> Yeah I just used powershell to copy install files and install
[02:01:27] <sd> 13<C​olour> And it worked great
[02:01:33] <Hunterkll> oldschool way is SCCM too :p
[02:01:36] <sd> 13<C​olour> And I could get-service or whatever to check if it was installed
[02:01:38] <Hunterkll> has been since Win3.1/dos days 
[02:01:43] <sd> 13<C​olour> Hahhhhh
[02:01:51] <Hunterkll> well, it was called SMS back then, but yolo
[02:01:58] <sd> 11<H​otmess> the amoutn of companeis ive worked for that refuse to pay for sccm is waaayyy to high
[02:02:02] <Hunterkll> product name didn't change till SCCM 2007 
[02:02:07] <Hunterkll> SCCM is stupid cheap too 
[02:02:09] <sd> 13<C​olour> So I really need SCCM when I can just make powershell scripts
[02:02:16] <Hunterkll> $61 per workstation for license with 2 years of SA 
[02:02:18] <sd> 13<C​olour> Do I *
[02:02:26] <Hunterkll> not really, SCCM does a lot of shit though 
[02:02:33] <Hunterkll> not just install software/configure changes 
[02:02:37] <sd> 13<C​olour> Never used it because nobody has it
[02:02:48] <sd> 13<C​olour> I'm just using what I have for now
[02:02:50] <sd> 11<H​otmess> its avaible on eval
[02:02:57] <sd> 13<C​olour> Ah I can try it for home I guess
[02:02:58] <sd> 11<H​otmess> if you wanna try it
[02:03:01] <Hunterkll> @Hotmess how many of them use intune though - you get SCCM rights with intune in a lot of license scenarios 
[02:03:02] <Hunterkll> lol
[02:03:06] <sd> 13<C​olour> I like provisioning packages too they seem nice and easy
[02:03:11] <Hunterkll> now for servers, SCCM is a bit pricey
[02:03:19] <Hunterkll> because you can't buy it standalone for servers - have to license the entire SC suite
[02:03:26] <Hunterkll> which is like $3k/host for datacenter licenses 
[02:03:37] <Hunterkll> or $1.5k for standard which is just 2 guest VMs that can be managed
[02:03:37] <sd> 11<H​otmess> you should see the amount of companeis ive workd for that refuse to buy SA
[02:03:38] <Hunterkll> lol
[02:03:45] <Hunterkll> @Hotmess can't buy SCCM without SA 
[02:03:52] <sd> 11<H​otmess> i am aware
[02:03:53] <sd> 13<C​olour> Wowww
[02:04:12] <sd> 13<C​olour> Yeah look, I know pretty much everyone will be using powershell so I'm cool trying to use that for everything
[02:04:19] <sd> 11<H​otmess> you also cant live migrate vms without SA
[02:04:28] <Hunterkll> .... yes, yes you can.....
[02:04:29] <sd> 11<H​otmess> but 🤷
[02:04:32] <sd> 13<C​olour> I feel like it would be far more valuable to just do as much as I can with powershell than to rely on a tool future companies might not have
[02:04:40] <Hunterkll> @Colour but that's for the entire SC suite, so you're throwing in your vcenter equivelent, datacenter wide monitoring, backup software (disk & tape), helpdesk/ITIL software, etc 
[02:05:01] <sd> 11<H​otmess> if your gonna do that colour create a git repo
[02:05:06] <sd> 11<H​otmess> to store your shit in
[02:05:22] <sd> 13<C​olour> It even feels like I could premake some agnostic scripts so if I move company I can just run things to get an idea of what I'm dealing with infrastructure wise. Provide me reports of servers, their services, their installed programs, their hardware, stale servers, stale users, what the domain controllers are, and so on.
[02:05:36] <sd> 13<C​olour> Git some time I'm sure
[02:05:51] <sd> 13<C​olour> I stopped getting ill so I've been starting to script stuff and make actual progress now
[02:06:03] <Hunterkll> SC shit also includes orchestrator which is really nice 
[02:06:09] <Hunterkll> i use it to configure linux boxes instead of ansible 
[02:06:09] <sd> 13<C​olour> Huhhh
[02:06:16] <sd> 13<C​olour> It depends on what workplaces I end up in I guess
[02:06:34] <sd> 11<H​otmess> techinaly you can do that with dsc too
[02:06:36] <haise01> Hunterkll: I like Ansible for Linux boxes :P
[02:06:45] <haise01> I'm YAML masochist 
[02:07:02] <sd> 13<C​olour> I don't know how common SCCM is tho because, as I said, I've never actually seen it. The university I was at had training for it and never used it.
[02:07:10] <Hunterkll> @Hotmess DSC is really limited though in what it can/does 
[02:07:31] <sd> 11<H​otmess> yeah but its still powershell
[02:07:40] <sd> 11<H​otmess> so you can fallback on raw .net if you have too
[02:07:40] <Hunterkll> i'm not going to use DSC for "Log into this box, pull this log file, if X condition, do Y to service, test connection to Y, send input to Y to enable Z"
[02:08:00] <sd> 13<C​olour> Having a script that will just install roles and features I need in 5 minutes sounds great enough to me. Just, provisioning package on a VM or whatever it is people do these days.
[02:08:00] <Hunterkll> DSC's more for your static configs/steady state changes 
[02:08:12] <sd> 11<H​otmess> like ensure service X is running
[02:08:17] <sd> 11<H​otmess> or set registry Y
[02:08:19] <Hunterkll> yea, DSC's great for that 
[02:08:21] <sd> 13<C​olour> Vast majority of IT workers I have encountered are Next Next Next Install people
[02:08:34] <Hunterkll> Orchestrator can use whatever though, it just SSH's to the box and does shit 
[02:08:34] <sd> 11<H​otmess> beyond that most of my crap in PS is switch statments
[02:08:37] <sd> 13<C​olour> In fact I've never met an IT worker besides myself who even tries to script things
[02:08:38] <Hunterkll> hilariously, under the hood, it uses putty 
[02:09:44] <sd> 13<C​olour> Wait I have met one but he broke every single user account when he tried to make a script
[02:10:29] <sd> 13<C​olour> Then my coworkers wanted to fix it manually by copy pasting folders and redoing permissions manually to 700+ folders which was stupid.
[02:10:49] <jimender27> Anyone know of any cheap screens that I can turn into a digital picture frame?
[02:11:14] <sd> 13<C​olour> Not cheap ones nah
[02:11:25] <sd> 13<C​olour> I think some companies do picture frame displays but they're usually expensive
[02:11:36] <Hunterkll> but yea learning at least SCCM is a valuble skill
[02:11:47] <Hunterkll> hell all the SCCM engineer jobs i've looked at are $100k+ easy 
[02:11:54] <haise01> really ?
[02:11:57] <Hunterkll> for back end/high level engineering/management
[02:12:02] <sd> 13<C​olour> Yeah I'll at least give it a look. As long as it doesn't integrate and break anything, and I can get rid of it if I want no problems, I'll try it out in my home.
[02:12:31] <Hunterkll> yea no you can just rip it out and uninstall agents whenever you want
[02:12:51] <sd> 11<H​otmess> without reboots thankfulyl
[02:12:52] <jimender27> I have a 3.5 inch screen for a rpi that is kinda small
[02:12:52] <sd> 13<C​olour> Woo
[02:12:59] <sd> 13<C​olour> Powershell install and uninstall the agents
[02:13:13] <sd> 13<C​olour> Powershell get if the agent is installed
[02:13:13] <Hunterkll> Actually, set up a service account with admin rights and just blanket deploy using the SCCM console

[02:13:35] <sd> 11<H​otmess> is MS configuration program

[02:14:15] <Hunterkll> .....
[02:14:17] <Hunterkll> it is far, far more than that
[02:14:28] <Hunterkll> and in SCCM, you're literally just using MDT task sequences

[02:14:33] <sd> 13<C​olour> I haven't done imagine for a decade ok I don't remember how to do it. I've used provisioning packages and scripts to install things and domain join tho.
[02:14:41] <Hunterkll> so it's literally just MDT/wsus in that regard
[02:14:41] <Hunterkll> lol
[02:14:56] <sd> 13<C​olour> I remember people used to use Norton Ghost all the way back when, and MDT? From Windows 7 onwards.

[02:15:05] <sd> 11<H​otmess> oh man those were the days
[02:15:08] <Hunterkll> @Colour yea i just PXE boot and come back 20 minutes later to a domain joined server with all the agents and pre-config shit installed
[02:15:09] <Hunterkll> lol

[02:15:18] <sd> 13<C​olour> Yeah! I vaguely remember it being great

[02:31:15] <Hunterkll> jimender27: one of my comments was literally about how unpaid internships work
[02:31:16] <Hunterkll> lol
[02:31:29] <Hunterkll> you can have unapid interns, but it's basically just them shadowing or doing practice shit that you are doing yourself 
[02:31:29] <jimender27> <Hunterkll> @Hotmess in the US, free unpaid interns can't do any actual work
[02:31:33] <sd> 13<C​olour> Another chat I was in was like "You can't ask for double pay that can't happen"
[02:31:33] <Hunterkll> right
[02:31:44] <Hunterkll> unpaid interns can't do any actual contribute to the company work
[02:31:48] <Hunterkll> just learn and do shit you've already done, etc 
[02:32:24] <Hunterkll> unless it's volunteer work for a nonprofit / charity shit, etc 
[02:32:31] <jimender27> Might be different in K12.  I let my unpaid interns do all sorts of shit.  When I was an unpaid intern I did all sorts of shit too
[02:32:59] <Hunterkll> they can "complemeent" your work too (unpaid interns) but not replace what a paid employee does
[02:33:08] <Hunterkll> https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/71-flsa-internships
[02:33:35] <jimender27> Hmmm
[02:33:38] <Hunterkll> basically, the intern has to get far more value out of the unpaid internship 
[02:33:40] <Hunterkll> then the company gets 
[02:34:03] <Hunterkll> so like
[02:34:03] <jimender27> Pretty sure my previous place violated that then
[02:34:11] <Hunterkll> if you're deploying machines, they can work alongside you and help set up more machines 
[02:34:24] <Hunterkll> but it basically has to be a "this would get done in about the same time anyway if you do it yourself" type deal for the most part
[02:34:34] <Hunterkll> obvoiusly they can help you get it done faster, not a big deal
[02:34:38] <Hunterkll> but they can't be 100% the only one doing it 
[02:34:39] <Hunterkll> etc
[02:35:28] <Hunterkll> basically look at the 7 prong test on the DOL site 
[02:35:53] <jimender27> shit we had 9th graders imaging and doing full hell desk.  Very little supervision

[02:36:21] <Hunterkll> can't interfere with school, know that they're unpaid, they're receiving valuble training, time limited duration, doesn't replace paid employee
[02:36:25] <Hunterkll> is the primary requirements
[02:36:54] <Hunterkll> then again, throw $7.25/hr at them (or your state's higher minimum as required) and all those concerns go out the window 
[02:37:22] <Hunterkll>  "If the intern performs work that benefits the employer and that would otherwise be performed by a regular employee, it is unlikely to be an internship. If the intern performs work that primarily benefits the intern and does not do work that would otherwise be performed by an employee, it is more likely to be an internship."
[02:37:37] <Hunterkll> in the case of paid interns, they're actually regular employees, just in a special internship style internal program you set up 
[02:37:49] <jimender27> they were randomly pulled out of classes by teachers in the school
[02:37:58] <Hunterkll> yea that's a little different
[02:38:05] <jimender27> they got out of a few tests Im pretty sure
[02:38:06] <Hunterkll> pulling people to do  IT work at school coudl be co nsidered teaching 
[02:38:08] <Hunterkll> lol
[02:38:28] <Hunterkll> that's totally a different basket case than regular unpaid internships at a company 
[02:38:52] <Hunterkll> it's more akin to like, having a class go out and clean up trash from the wooded area behind the school as an organized session type deal 
[02:39:21] <jimender27> I know when I was in their positions I was pulled by the IT / CompTIA teacher to turn on his computer.
[02:39:40] <jimender27> got out of a few college exams that way too
[02:39:58] <Hunterkll> yea college is a bit different in these regards as well

[02:40:41] <Hunterkll> still, colleges lean more to following standard employment laws / internship laws 
[02:41:03] <jimender27> my senior year we started pulling 7th graders for helldesk as well
[02:41:11] <haise01> wtf lol
[02:41:23] <haise01> my school has one man IT
[02:41:29] <haise01> its literal hell for him

[02:57:23] <Hunterkll> Nevertheless, once you get it sorted out, it works good as a photo viewer. Really, it was the best of the free apps....you get what you pay for.

[05:58:52] <sd> 06<b​loody> And militaries feed those to hundreds of thousands of people
[05:59:05] <Hunterkll> well that's the price you pay to buy them on the civie market 
[05:59:08] <Hunterkll> not what the military pays
[05:59:17] <radix0> economies of scale
[05:59:30] <sd> 06<b​loody> Wonder how much of a markup civs get
[05:59:54] <sd> 06<b​loody> I'd assume 50%
[06:00:06] <radix0> I was thinking 1000%
[06:00:07] <sd> 06<b​loody> If not more
[06:00:21] <Hunterkll> military cost is like, $86.98 per case apparently
[06:00:23] <Hunterkll> $7.25/unit
[06:01:05] <radix0> I'm surprised they're that much.
[06:01:20] <sd> 06<b​loody> Well it is food
[06:01:40] <Hunterkll> they're also really only used for field ops/exercises and deployment shit 
[06:01:45] <Hunterkll> normally you got cooks/chow hall etc 
[06:02:06] <Hunterkll> radix0: keep in mind these things are shelf-stable for 3 year at 80F 
[06:02:12] <radix0> I was just about to say that
[06:02:26] <radix0> Packaging, and I assume a lot of these units come with cooking elements and a fuel source, right?
[06:02:28] <sd> 07<J​amesKeenan> There are "time to complete" websites for books, movies, games. I would love a "time to complete" where people just log how long it took them to finish different projects and like a one-liner for how they did it.

[06:02:37] <Hunterkll> radix0: water based heater in a bag 
[06:02:55] <sd> 06<b​loody> Do any of them actually taste good
[06:03:02] <Hunterkll> there were a few that were okay
[06:03:09] <Hunterkll> apparently the pizza one that i'm sourcing is the 'holy grail' though 
[06:03:19] <Hunterkll> its basically just like a frozen pizza in taste apparently 
[06:03:24] <Hunterkll> and has breadsticks n shit with it
[06:03:30] <sd> 06<b​loody> Lol
[06:03:31] <radix0> how does that work (water heater)? Is it 1/unit or a handful per case?
[06:03:40] <Hunterkll> 1 per unit, disposable
[06:03:42] <Hunterkll> chemical reaction 
[06:03:49] <radix0> oh like exposure to oxygen?
[06:03:54] <radix0> iron something something?
[06:04:15] <sd> 06<b​loody> That and shaking it
[06:04:15] <Hunterkll> hm i guess? never really thought about it

[06:09:32] <Hunterkll> lol
[06:09:55] <Hunterkll> when you're in hell, even worse-than-cheese-wiz cheese with a bit of flavor is better than penut butter 
[06:12:58] <Hunterkll> radix0: also, the cost makes sense when you think about what an MRE contains
[06:13:14] <radix0> 3000 calories?
[06:14:08] <radix0> Just knowing each unit comes with the heating element is enough to explain it. Energy ain't cheap.
[06:14:21] <Hunterkll> 1,250 cals actually
[06:14:24] <Hunterkll> or just about
[06:14:38] <radix0> for some reason I thought they were more. I keep forgetting field/deployment situation
[06:15:43] <Hunterkll> but no, main food item, a side item, the crackers with spread, a dessert item, some kinda gatorade like drink, coffee with creamer, tabasco, spoon, salt/pepper, toilet paper, sugar, etc
[06:15:55] <Hunterkll> radix0: you might be thinking of LRE's 
[06:16:14] <Hunterkll> er, LRP
[06:16:43] <Hunterkll> which is the MCW
[06:17:11] <radix0> Probably. Time for bed. o7
[06:17:15] <Hunterkll> which is 4500 cals
[06:17:26] <Hunterkll> it's when you're doing long range shit and can't carry much, so you got like 1 a day 
[06:18:04] <Hunterkll> oh wait its not anymore
[06:18:06] <Hunterkll> huh

[18:03:46] <JollyRgrs> but yes, makes it much easier to expand live
[18:03:51] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> If you're using LVM, it should be pretty easy assuming the underlying disk isn't a pain in the ass.
[18:04:03] <sd> 13<C​olour> I did it to a home server fine, this is an LVM on a single virtual disk, I expanded the virtual disk, I done a scan to detect the extra space, 
[18:04:03] <sd> 13<C​olour> 
[18:04:03] <sd> 13<C​olour> For my home server, I was able to expand space fine
[18:04:03] <sd> 13<C​olour> 
[18:04:03] <sd> 13<C​olour> For this work server it's like, nah mate I'm busy
[18:04:04] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> If you aren't using LVM, you will probably need to take an outage.
[18:04:15] <sd> 13<C​olour> Why do you need a bloody outage to expand a disk
[18:04:21] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> So you expanded the virtual disk...did you expand the partition?
[18:04:32] <JollyRgrs> if it is a VM and / is mounted at the end, you're still able to do it live
[18:04:33] <sd> 13<C​olour> That's what resize2fs does right
[18:04:34] <signofzeta> I had to do that once.  Whoever set up the server put a filesystem on the raw disk, instead of a partition table and partitions.  However, that made expansion a one-step process.
[18:04:41] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> No, resize2fs is ONLY the filesystem.
[18:04:59] <JollyRgrs> but usually /swap or something is after /, so you can't just expand the disk, b/c you can't add freespace at the end to partition 1
[18:05:08] <sd> 13<C​olour> Well if I go into whatever cfdisk is I can see the free space next to sda2
[18:05:15] <JollyRgrs> so i've removed swap and then expanded
[18:05:21] <PublicWiFi> speaking of home setups, anyone know the reason why home windows setups can sometimes name networks wonky stuff on the interface? like Ethernet 1 would be named after some reason device on the network something lol
[18:05:23] <signofzeta> @Colour: After the partition, at the end of the disk?
[18:05:35] <sd> 13<C​olour> I think so yeah?
[18:06:01] <JollyRgrs> what you have to end up doing is editing the partition with the new part size... so you gotta do some maths and be "vewy vewy careful" like you are hunting wabbits
[18:06:17] <PublicWiFi> had a client of mine with a "workgroup" network have their NICs soemtimes adopt his wifi extender's hostname as their network description lol
[18:06:25] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> You also have the option of making a new partition with the free space, making a new physical volume, and adding it to the volume group.
[18:06:33] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> Which is "messy" but potentially less impactful.
[18:06:40] <JollyRgrs> you are talking about LVM
[18:06:41] <signofzeta> You might be able to boot off of a PartitionMagic disk or something.  I found an old one years ago.  (Sadly, that ancient version doesn't support GPT disks.  Yeah, that old.)
[18:06:46] <JollyRgrs> there's no volume groups for simple GPT
[18:07:27] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> But he's using LVM, so he has the option of adding a new PV to the VG.
[18:08:39] <sd> 13<C​olour> UuUuhh
[18:08:51] <JollyRgrs> ah, yeah i missed that he answered he WAS on LVM
[18:09:02] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> @Colour Can you show us your partition table?
[18:09:08] <JollyRgrs> so yeha... adding a PV to the VG works

[23:52:05] <sd> 10<M​eltingteeth> The company is just going to scapegoat someone and restructure I'd wager.
[23:52:10] <voice06[m]> and my DS415+ chooses today to die as well
[23:52:14] <nobyk> Kind of amazing discord is still up
[23:52:25] <nobyk> I wouldn't have been surprised if it hooked into that shit somehow
[23:52:43] <sd> 11<H​otmess> discord runs on aws
[23:52:52] <sd> 11<H​otmess> so discord goes when aws goes

[23:53:15] <sd> 10<M​eltingteeth> The stuff that was turned off should be almost entirely Facebook owned and run.
[23:53:20] <voice06[m]> I thought Discord was on GCP
[23:53:24] <iphone> big companies like fb don't just restructure
[23:53:28] <voice06[m]> at least they've blamed GCP before
[23:53:29] <int0x1C8> my DS411 is rebuilding its RAID5 right now

[23:53:54] <nobyk> Did they move to aws?
[23:54:08] <voice06[m]> int0x1C8: looks like mine finally got taken down by the Intel Atom C2XXX hardware bug
[23:54:10] <sd> 06<n​eutron> i think both

[23:54:54] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> was it fb or microsoft that built a DC in northern sweden

[23:57:01] <nobyk> and I remember them having outages because google was having issues and they couldn't do much
[23:57:03] <AnonymooseReddtr> MS has one in denmark
[23:57:04] <nobyk> but that was a while ago
[23:57:09] <nobyk> maybe they changed things
