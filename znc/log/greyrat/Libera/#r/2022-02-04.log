[01:57:21] <Bayes> velix awesome!
[01:58:13] <velix> Bayes: A discount store here in Germany has supplemented virtually all of its meat offerings with vegan replicas. Damn cheap and it even tastes if you season a little stronger.
[01:58:43] <Bayes> I really don't miss meat at all so I'm not huge into meat replacements, I do tend to have a vegan burger from time to time from this brand... but mostly because it's smoky :P
[01:58:56] <velix> Vegan burgers, vegan fish, vegan cheese, vegan sausage, vegan sausages, vegan candy, etc.
[01:59:01] <Bayes> nooo I'm so looking forward to the day that happens here velix
[01:59:26] <velix> The vegan tuna is CRAZY.
[01:59:33] <Bayes> Walmart and Aldi have their own cheap brand of vegan replicas, but they're not as competitive as their own brand products typically are compared to branded ones
[01:59:54] <velix> WOf course, when you "raw" it tastes different. But in a salad or in a pasta sauce ... does not stand out.
[02:00:22] <Bayes> ah never had fish and tuna and all that, not my taste
[02:00:31] <velix> Bayes: True. LIDL in Germany is similar. Their vegan minced meat is interesting.
[02:00:35] <Bayes> I do know some people put some in salad and that
[02:00:48] <Bayes> is LIDL the true Aldi?
[02:01:00] <Bayes> as in was Aldi the english friendly name they gave it?
[02:01:05] <velix> Bayes: The vegan fish stick/fingers with vegan mayonnaise is funny.
[02:01:15] <velix> I'm living in the town where ALDI was founded.
[02:01:22] <Bayes> oh that's cool
[02:01:32] <Bayes> cheap products for everyone lol
[02:01:35] <velix> LIDL, ALDI, Penny, Netto are the leading discounters here.
[02:01:52] <Bayes> I always get the german cookies aldi brings
[02:01:54] <velix> Edeka, REWE and Kaufland are the bigger ones, but full sortiment.
[02:02:11] <Bayes> then two years after they started bringing some italian cookies that are exactly the same as the german ones lmao
[02:02:21] <velix> Bayes: And the Germans love the stuff from the Netherlanders ;)

[02:02:56] <velix> Bayes: Yeah, friends of mine are visiting Spain once a year and go shopping at LIDL. Most products are the same.
[02:03:01] <velix> But the fish fingers have a different color.
[02:03:07] <velix> In Germany, they're white.

[03:06:58] <rickyrick> Yeah do.call calls what with args

[20:52:50] <resistor4u> so the docs for `theme` indicate user can control display of keys, justification, text and font face etc
[20:53:12] <Bayes> yes
[20:53:41] <Bayes> either + theme(keyword1 = value, keyword2 = value) etc or set_theme if you want to do it globally
[20:53:54] <since_> Bayes: what does it mean anyway? the result is a vector where each element is the sum of distances from one point to all the others
[20:54:34] <resistor4u> for some reason, my legend is spitting out one long list, which gets cut off when saving the file. i'd like to split it into two columns. there are SO questions to this effect, but i'm not getting it to work for my case
[20:55:18] <Bayes> since_ well that's my point really, each element in d^2 is a nonnegative distance across a dimension, so what does it mean to weight the dimensions with possibly negative values?
[20:55:49] <since_> you can remove a distance from the sum then
[20:56:04] <since_> subract*
[20:56:06] <Bayes> resistor4u did you try something like guides(fill=guide_legend(ncol=2)) ?
[20:56:18] <Bayes> since_ agreed, and that means ?....
[20:56:27] <since_> whatever you want
[20:56:41] <resistor4u> Bayes: exactly so, but no dice
[20:56:51] <resistor4u> i'm getting MRE together now
[20:57:12] <Bayes> okey
[20:57:49] <since_> its a distance you need to drive anyway, so you can subtract it from the penalty for your optimization problem
[20:58:11] <since_> or + is uphill and - is downhill,
[20:59:03] <Bayes> still doesn't make much sense in this context
[20:59:15] <Bayes> I mean, is it mathematically legit? sure
[20:59:24] <Bayes> but in this problem d^2 is a measure of similarity
[20:59:59] <Bayes> and giving a negative weight you'd get something like nearness is associated with lower correlation o.o
[21:00:29] <Bayes> or... the less similar, the higher the correlation o.o
[21:00:47] <confuzeus> can the weights be negative? won't that result in sqrt(-negative sum)?
[21:01:01] <Bayes> they can according to since_
[21:01:43] <Bayes> it seems since_ is arguing that you could use that to model some kidn of anisotropy but idk ?
[21:02:11] <since_> Bayes: i guess i can make an example
[21:02:22] <Bayes> since_ no, I do get what you mean
[21:02:29] <since_> where it can make sense (but i dont know if its your problem)
[21:02:50] <Bayes> it doesn't make the sense in the case of a correlation function
[21:03:35] <Bayes> or maybe it does, but you get to a case where again the more similar the obs are, the less correlated they are
[21:03:38] <since_> what do you mean by measure of similarty?
[21:04:15] <Bayes> d^2 is a measure of dissimilarity, if you multiply it by a negative quantity it becomes a similarity
[21:04:29] <Bayes> idk if it still holds that it's a metric tho
[21:04:56] <Bayes> I mean it doesn't, a matrix need be nonnegative
[21:05:03] <Bayes> nevermind I contacted the authors and let's see what they do
[21:05:22] <since_> do you have a labeled set and you want to check if a point is to be associated with this set? then it means, yes you are probably in the category but try to stay away from the one counterexample
[21:27:35] <resistor4u> PHEW
[21:27:42] <resistor4u> ok here it is

[21:29:25] <resistor4u> all that jazz in the 'Repsonses' legend is what gets cut out, seemingly regardless of the dims i save the file
[21:29:48] <resistor4u> so it'd be best to optimize the space and split the damn thing
[21:30:24] <resistor4u> a previous graph with the same calls just using diff data split it up automagically
[21:51:41] <resistor4u> any takers?
[21:51:42] <resistor4u> lol
[21:55:00] <resistor4u> ah
[21:55:05] <resistor4u> ok
[21:56:09] <resistor4u> specify size.legend=FALSE, then `guides(size=guide_legend(ncol=2))`

[21:57:39] <resistor4u> but now i cannot alter the alpha of the symbols in the legend!!!
[21:57:43] <resistor4u> LMAO
[21:59:07] <resistor4u> nvm agian
[21:59:08] <resistor4u> guides(size=guide_legend(ncol=2, override.aes = list(alpha = 0.5)))

[22:02:00] <resistor4u> in soviet russia, ggplot does YOU
[23:48:00] <velix> R stands for Russia
[23:48:08] * velix hides
[23:55:24] <OnlineCop> Would that make R "Ruski" or "Risky"?
