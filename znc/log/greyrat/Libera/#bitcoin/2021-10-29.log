[01:09:14] <caveman> who sets the transaction fee in bitcoin?  is it the miners?
[01:09:43] *** Joins: Shoes (~Shoes@129.159.118.169)
[01:10:49] <AndyS2_> caveman: the sender. if you use a UTXO with a certain amount of bitcoin and just send less to potentially multiple recipients, the difference becomes claimable as a mining fee
[01:11:31] <AndyS2_> So say you had a UTXO with 10,000 sats and you send 9,000 to address A and 500 to address B. The remaining 500 sats that are unused implicitly become the fee
[01:12:13] <caveman> 10k sats?  is that enough money to buy all of u.s.a.?
[01:12:40] <caveman> so, UTXO is a special type of transactions newly introduced?
[01:12:46] <AndyS2_> 1 bitcoin is 100,000,000 sats
[01:13:02] <caveman> oh, forgot.  i mised btc with stats.
[01:13:09] <AndyS2_> caveman: there are no accounts in bitcoin, only unspent transaction outputs that basically hold your coins
[01:13:55] <AndyS2_> and when you send bitcoin, your wallet chooses one or multiple of those so you have enough bitcoin to make the transaction you want to do
[01:14:10] <caveman> yes.
[01:14:24] <AndyS2_> UTXO is short for unspent transaction output
[01:14:33] <caveman> but, how is the transaction fee determined?
[01:14:55] <caveman> was the network fee always the UTXO approach?
[01:15:03] <AndyS2_> sender decides, so usually the wallet of the sender chooses a reasonable amount, or asks the sender
[01:15:42] <caveman> so, with btc, the transaction fee is an open question determined by the supply-demand of the 'confirmation' market ?
[01:16:22] <AndyS2_> caveman: bitcoin always worked based on UTXOs. really early bitcoiners might remember a time when the fee to get your tx into a block was 0 as long as your UTXO had a certain age (i.e. not too recent)
[01:17:28] <AndyS2_> caveman: you basically have to convince miners to add your tx to their block. there's a (kinda small) cost for a miner to add your transaction to the block, because it makes it more likely that their found block arrives later at other nodes, which could cause their block to be discarded if another block is faster
[01:18:02] <AndyS2_> this was always the case, but in the early days it didn't matter too much I guess
[01:19:18] <caveman> so it's purely left to the market (users) to find an agreement
[01:20:29] <AndyS2_> You can't force someone to add your transaction. The people who want to get a transaction onto the blockchain have to find a miner willing to put the tx in their block, and that miner has to actually create a block.
[01:20:48] <AndyS2_> You also have to convince other nodes to relay your transaction (for free) I guess so it reaches a miner
[01:21:43] <AndyS2_> but they just do that so bitcoin works, as long as you aren't spamming with lots of similar transactions or transactions that break bitcoin rules (like, broken signatures)
[01:22:35] <AndyS2_> You can read up on RBF if you are interested in how they solved the spamming problem while enabling users to replace a transaction that hasn't been mined yet

[01:27:40] *** Joins: Shoes (~Shoes@129.159.118.169)
[01:29:20] <AndyS2_> caveman: yeah, basically. I just wanted to be precise regarding 'users'
[01:30:03] *** maverick|zz is now known as maverick
[01:31:05] <AndyS2_> caveman: Bitcoin can only work with fees for transactions in the long term. About every 4 years the standard rewards for mining a block halves. If it halves often enough, not enough money would pay for the security of the blockchain if it weren't for the fees that also add onto that.
[01:32:28] <AndyS2_> (Even if price continually outperformed those halvings so the miners actually end up with more money, which is super unrealistic, it'd finally be over when a little less than 21 million bitcoin have been created in the year ~2140)

[04:56:45] <yanmaani> AndyS2_: Yes, but there's other consumers of last resort already. Either the power is expensive, and then you can just build anyway without the miners, or it's not, and then you'd do better to build elsewhere.
[05:00:24] <yanmaani> What energy source are you even talking about if not nuclear?
[05:00:46] <yanmaani> Because renewables + mining is an unsuited combination
[05:01:31] <yanmaani> Hydro works, but that doesn't have the annoying viability problems
[05:02:02] <coco> You can use waste from industrial oil operations to mine bitcoin, too.

[05:03:11] <yanmaani> A normal nuclear reactor is about 1000 MW, Bitcoin does 100 TWh/yr in electricity use. 1GW * 24 * 365 = 8.8 TWh.
[05:03:41] <yanmaani> So you would need to move quite a bit of mining there, and then the question is of course, why put the mining there to begin with?
[05:03:56] <yanmaani> coco: in the sense that you can run a natural gas plant, yes
[05:05:17] <yanmaani> but they could just sell that power into the grid. Bitcoin will never contribute to make power demand more stable or act as a battery or anything, that's utter nonsense.
[05:05:26] <yanmaani> If it does anything, it will be by raising power prices.
[05:05:27] <coco> This doesn't really solve the block size problem though.

You just need to be able to sell the surplus power from the bigger plant for a price that pays for the extra costs. I might be bad at explaining this.

[12:50:56] <yanmaani> for one, if you're not talking about nuclear, what power source are you talking about
[12:51:14] <yanmaani> but also, "being able to sell" power is not really a problem
[12:52:38] <yanmaani> Being able to sell power at an interesting rate, now that might be. If demand is too low, you have to lower your prices accordingly.

But it works better when the fuel makes up a small part of the price, and the building of the plant makes up the biggest part of the cost, and doesn't become linearly bigger ...

[13:59:57] <yanmaani> this goes for everything here, except for gas I suppose, where you do flaring and that gives you some power. But this is obviously not scalable.

[20:14:49] <Librarian> Go ahead and use bigger blocks. You have that option.
[20:15:05] <s17> I want more variety for LN desktop clients
[20:15:23] <Librarian> But, don't bother talking about it here. We have seen that those who advocate for bigger blocks really only do so because they are trying to seize control of the development processes and resources.
[20:15:57] <Librarian> If you're sincere, go complain to the people who were actually using big blocks as a trojan horse to take over "control" of bitcoin.
[20:16:02] <Librarian> They ruined it for you.

[20:16:55] <coco> You're making some pretty wild accusations.
[20:17:25] <Librarian> Not at all. The big-block attackers admitted to everything I've just described, a few years after everyone stopped paying attention to them.
[20:17:33] <Librarian> They're a greg maxwell hate cult and nothing more, nowadays.
[20:17:48] <coco> Who tf is greg maxwell?
[20:18:02] <Librarian> He's a bitcoin core developer.

[20:19:55] <Librarian> It's a tactic of the dishonest, insincere, disingenuous trojan-horse attackers to continue to claim that blocks are limited to 1 MB. They are not. They are usually larger.
[20:20:00] <belcher> theres also the book The Blocksize Wars

[20:21:18] <Librarian> Please go to the IRC channels that serve and implement such forks.
[20:21:28] <Librarian> Please do not bother wasting your time here. What you want exists, today, right now.
[20:21:34] <Librarian> You can go use them. Please go use them.
[20:21:38] <coco> Ok, but again, you're trying to instigate a fight and I'm trying to get information that might cause me to reconsider the need for bigger blocks.
[20:21:55] <Librarian> No I'm not trying to instigate a fight. I'm telling you that you can have what you want. That's not instigating a fight.
[20:21:59] <belcher> coco read some of the links on the list i posted to see why scaling via big blocks is a bad idea
[20:22:12] <Librarian> You can have the bigger blocks you want, right now, today. Go use them.
[20:22:22] <coco> I plan to check it out Belcher, but I'm on the train right now
[20:22:33] <Librarian> But do not try to repeat the arguments of the past in this channel; those forks are off-topic here.
[20:22:34] <coco> Librarian just keeps repeating like a broken record.
[20:22:53] <Librarian> Like you keep repeating your desire for bigger blocks like a broken record?
[20:23:02] <Librarian> What other response could you possibly expect? :D
[20:23:07] <Librarian> You seem very upset.
[20:23:16] <coco> Can you pose an actual argument against, say, 3MB blocks?
[20:23:40] <Librarian> No. You can have 3 MB blocks if you want them. Such forks already exist today, and you can use te.
[20:23:43] <Librarian> them.
[20:23:49] <coco> Or is it just because whoever greg maxwell is told you so?
[20:24:03] <Librarian> Not at all. That's why they exist, and you can use them right now.

[20:25:09] <Librarian> Or, are you refusing to go enjoy the answer to your question that exists and works because *you* have some kind of psychosocial disorder that you are projecting onto others?

[20:26:30] <belcher> A trip to the moon requires a rocket with multiple stages
[20:26:46] <Librarian> Are you ignoring the simple answer to my question--that blockchains with bigger blocks DO exist and you should go use them right now--because you have some kind of psychosocial disorder that you are projecting onto others?
[20:30:05] <coco> belcher, is nullc some kind of bitcoin philosopher or what?
[20:30:13] <coco> They have a pretty idealistic view of the world.
[20:31:52] <coco> Its almost like they chose what they feel are the primary values of bitcoin and heavily discounted other features like, idk, being a payment rail.
[20:31:53] <AndyS2_> Why do you assume that the optimal block size is an easy to answer question? And even if there were such a thing at a given time, why assume that it'd be easy to implement a way for a decentralized, permissionless system to arrive at that size at the right time?

[20:32:52] <coco> Its the literal job of a literal engineer.
[20:33:04] <belcher> coco bitcoin's unique selling point isnt to be a payment rail
[20:33:09] <Librarian> AndyS2_, in fairness, it *is* a pretty easy-to-answer question: the market decides what the optimal size is. :) The market has obviously decided that 2MB blocks are the best tradeoff for long-term security and scalability of the blockchain.
[20:33:13] <coco> I don't assume it is an easy question to answer.
[20:33:18] <AndyS2_> But without you spending the time to read some of the provided links, it's pretty senseless to talk further. If people don't even have a good idea what the trade offs and problems in a space are, they can hardly lead a meaningful discussion about a solution.
[20:33:26] <belcher> sure you need a payment rail in bitcoin, but thats not the revolutionary thing, after all visa/mastercard already exist
[20:33:33] <coco> belcher, isn't that just a value judgement, though, and so inherently subjective?
[20:34:10] <belcher> if you disagree nobody is forcing you to use bitcoin
[20:34:10] <coco> Perhaps, for me, the value in bitcoin is in remittances to my family in Kenya.
[20:34:12] <AndyS2_> Librarian: some markets I have seen run into problems by being too short-sighted and seeking immediate payoff
[20:34:18] <belcher> you could always use paypal or something instead ;)
[20:34:26] <belcher> coco are you aware of lightning network?
[20:34:41] <coco> Yes, I also know that not a lot of people use LN.
[20:34:48] <Librarian> But just because the market has determined that 2 MB blocks provide the best tradeoff has not meant that others cannot try different things. So it's good news, that the others exist. And can be used right now, by anyone who isn't merely concern trolling (as it seems belcher correctly identified).

[20:36:51] <coco> So would you say that we shouldn't have a criterion for optimal block size, either because its too hard or because whatever a greg maxwell is says it should be x value?
[20:37:06] <Librarian> It's determined by the market, as I've said twice now.
[20:37:16] <coco> The block size is?
[20:37:19] <Librarian> And that's good, because it means we all have choices and options.
[20:37:22] *** Joins: busybusybusy (~BUSY@user/busy)
[20:37:23] <Librarian> Yes.

[20:37:46] <coco> Ok, but forget other coins. I'm talking about bitcoin. Who decides the block size in bitcoin?
[20:37:51] <Librarian> So the only question remaining is, "why don't you go use one of the other options?" If you do, then you might be able to contribute to its ecosystem and make it more valuable.

[20:37:55] <coco> Other coins are just distracting.
[20:38:01] <Librarian> Its users.
[20:38:14] <coco> Is it users or miners?
[20:38:28] <Librarian> Miners *are* users. Don't commit a false-choice fallacy here.

[20:38:41] <coco> It seems to me that miners are a dictator in bitcoin.
[20:38:52] <coco> If they decide to run bigger blocks, then users get bigger blocks.
[20:38:56] *** Joins: nathanael_ (~nathanael@user/nathanael)
[20:39:01] <coco> If they decide to run segwit, then users get segwit.
[20:39:08] <Librarian> Absolutely not. No miner has ever forced anyone to use a cryptocurrency they didn't want to use, ever in history.
[20:39:27] <coco> I, as some peasant with a wallet, have no deciding power in what the bitcoin protocol looks like.
[20:39:32] <coco> I am a protocol-taker.
[20:40:03] <coco> My only option is use the coin or not.
[20:40:11] <Librarian> Sure you do. You have equal choice, like every other human on this planet, to participate in whatever currency exchange you want, and even run a node if you want, and even change the source code of the software if you want.
[20:40:17] <Librarian> You have equal choice to everyone else in the world.
[20:40:40] <Librarian> Your other options include using different blockchains that better suit your desires, or to write your own blockchain software.
[20:40:53] <coco> Ok, but be realistic.
[20:41:02] <Librarian> No one is constraining you against using other currencies or writing your own; nor is anyone forcing you to use something you don't want to.
[20:41:24] <Librarian> That is realistic. This channel is for people who *have done* this very same choosing, among the choices you have.
[20:41:35] <Librarian> If you refuse to exercise your choices, then you don't belong in this channel.
[20:41:37] <coco> If I run some custom node, I would probably be on my own. Whereas some rich miner, like a greg maxwell, can spin up 1000 nodes and has market power.
[20:42:01] <Librarian> Oh, are you merely exercising your jealousy?
[20:42:17] <Librarian> No one has stopped you from making the same decisions in life and in software that others among us have.
[20:42:31] <coco> smh, you are so antagonistic
[20:42:37] <Librarian> So, make your choices in life, and enjoy the consequences of your choices.
[20:42:43] <coco> I bet you're a real hit at parties.
[20:42:44] <Librarian> Offering you choices and options is not antagonistic.
[20:42:57] <Librarian> I am, but only at parties with intelligent people in attendance.
[20:43:06] <Librarian> You might have to just take my word for that. ;)
[20:43:07] <coco> midnight, get your boy.

[21:48:20] <Librarian> And it's worth noting: if you *do* decide to wiggle a balloon animal at someone, don't then subsequently project your own antagonism onto the people who are telling you, "yes, you can have exactly what you're asking for." If you try to project your antagonism onto such a person, it's merely showing them that you are truly just wiggling a balloon animal at people, and not a sincere desire for honest
