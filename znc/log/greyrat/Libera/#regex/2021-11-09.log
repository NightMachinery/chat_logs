[00:00:28] <faLUKE> JohnDoe2_: It works, sorry. There has to be an issue somewhere else
[00:01:03] <JohnDoe2_> if you're like me you made some silly mistake elsewhere and you were going to find it eventually. Get a ducky ;)
[00:02:04] <faLUKE> JohnDoe2_: absolutely not, don't  worry :-))
[00:02:21] <JohnDoe2_> suit yourself.
[00:02:39] <JohnDoe2_> you can always talk to your cat but then you'd be labeled crazy. Apparently talking to a rubber duck is normal.
[00:03:28] <faLUKE> JohnDoe2_: I always talk with my cat ;-), especially in these pandemic times!!
[00:03:48] <JohnDoe2_> wife's sick of hearing it?
[00:03:52] <faLUKE> (btw, I solved the issue meanwile)
[00:03:56] <faLUKE> I'm not married...
[00:03:57] <JohnDoe2_> üëç
[00:04:05] <JohnDoe2_> me neither, but if I were, she would be sick of hearing it
[00:04:53] <JohnDoe2_> "Oh check this out babe, with regex you can pull the total of all your starbucks trips this last month! And it's only 20% of our entertainment budget!"
[00:06:38] <faLUKE> ?? is regex renumerative? or is it irony? :-)

[20:05:38] <re101-robin-8> hi guys what can i do with regex?
[20:06:10] <OnlineCop> re101-robin-8: Mainly parse text depending on what kind of data you've got, and depending on which values/patterns you want to find within it.
[20:07:05] <OnlineCop> PhoneNumberRegEx: Would you be able to copy your original text that you had in that imgur image, into your regex101 page? It makes searching for text a bit easier on the page than in the image.

[20:10:23] <OnlineCop> Just until I've got the regex format all sorted out, I want to do something horrible. I'd like to change to PCRE2 so I can add comments within the regex pattern itself. Once we get it "working", we can strip all the non-ECMAScript stuff back out.
[20:12:09] <PhoneNumberRegEx> Comments are life mainly in complicated situations like Regular Expressions
[20:12:21] <OnlineCop> Wholeheartedly agree.
[20:12:51] <OnlineCop> Is this portion the State Code logic? `(?:\(?([1-9][0-9])\)?\s?)`
[20:14:03] <PhoneNumberRegEx> It is in GROUP3 of the MATCH1 session (right-side of the regex101 page)
[20:14:31] <OnlineCop> I just mean that I'm going to name it, so I can grok what each portion is doing.
[20:15:07] <OnlineCop> I'm also confused about the last lines on that, such as: "[13:33:36] <PhoneNumberRegEx> 3[1234578][6-9]"
[20:15:30] <OnlineCop> I don't see any State Code that starts with 3 in your provided list (or image screenshot), so I'm not sure what those should be matching.
[20:16:24] <PhoneNumberRegEx> VALID state codes: 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 37, 38
[20:16:24] <PhoneNumberRegEx> Next number after the state code MUST BE any number between 6 and 9
[20:16:45] <PhoneNumberRegEx> My mistake, I completely forgot the "3" state codes
[20:17:12] <OnlineCop> Okay, thanks. I'll update my working copy with those 30's numbers.
[20:17:59] <OnlineCop> Oh, I now understand what those trailing `[6-9]` meant after your state codes.
[20:18:23] *** Quits: Armanzor (~Armanzor@user/armanzor) (Quit: Leaving)
[20:18:56] <PhoneNumberRegEx> Yes, phone numbers (without international code/state code/optional 9 digit) must "begin" with 6, 7, 8 or 9
[20:21:59] <OnlineCop> International Code: May be prefixed with optional `+` or `00`, then exactly 2 digits (such as `55`). Is that correct?
[20:24:12] <PhoneNumberRegEx> Prefixed only with + then exactly 2 digits (55 in the examples I've been using)
[20:24:22] <PhoneNumberRegEx> 55 or +55
[20:24:27] <OnlineCop> No `00`?
[20:24:34] <OnlineCop> Or "either `+` or `00`" ?
[20:25:16] <PhoneNumberRegEx> No 00
[20:25:36] <PhoneNumberRegEx> Only +55 or 55 (in this example the intern. code is 55)
[20:25:38] <OnlineCop> Then "0055 (11) 98888-7777" is invalid?

[20:40:02] <OnlineCop> `9\d?` gives 1-2 digits, followed by mandatory `\d{3}` 3 digits, followed by 4 more digits at the end (total of 8-9 digits).

[20:48:03] <OnlineCop> Scenario 1: i10n prefix `+` or `00` may be present. Two-digit i10n code may also be present. If either is present, then the `9` following it is OPTIONAL.
[20:48:06] <OnlineCop> Scenario 2: i10n prefix and code are both missing, therefore the `9` is REQUIRED.

[20:51:48] <OnlineCop> NEW Scenario 3: The 2-digit State Code should match after either Scenario 1 or 2.
[20:52:25] <OnlineCop> Scenario 4: If Scenario 1 occurred, `9` is optional. Else if Scenario 2 occurred, `9` is required.

[22:14:22] <OnlineCop> You're basically at the start of the string and "peek" to the right to ensure that there are from 1 to 64 characters (anything except newline), and then you reach the end of the line. If that `(?=...)` is satisfies, then it restarts from the beginning of the line and starts doing the `[a-zA-Z...]` validation checks.

[22:17:55] <OnlineCop> PhoneNumberRegEx: There might be some incompatible characters in my regex, then. `[+]` made it easier for me to read than `\+` but might need to change. There are two capture groups for `(55)` instead of one. It might not like `\d` and we'll have to write it `[0-9]` instead...
[22:19:02] <re101-macaw-48> thank you OnlineCop, that works and finally made this ^(?=.{1,64}@)[a-zA-Z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+(?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+)*@(?=.{1,255}$)(?:[a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]*[a-zA-Z0-9])?\.)+[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?$
[22:19:16] <OnlineCop> re101-macaw-48: My pleasure. Glad it's working!
[22:19:27] <re101-macaw-48> :)
[22:19:54] <OnlineCop> PhoneNumberRegEx: I don't see `(?:` listed on https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/B14251_01/adfns_regexp.htm#i1007670
[22:20:14] <OnlineCop> PhoneNumberRegEx: So you might have to just change the non-capturing `(?:` to a capturing `(`

[22:21:44] <infinigent> OnlineCop It worked. Reversing the curly brackets worked like a charm. Thanks. lot
[22:21:57] <OnlineCop> infinigent: Awesome. My pleasure.
[22:22:16] <infinigent> I was assuming the issue was with the square brackets
