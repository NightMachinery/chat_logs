[00:00:09] <SummerSkies> there are people who don't think I should have my guns, I've spoken to them
[00:00:15] <TsundereNoises> we'd need a whole new system
[00:00:18] <S_T_A_N> TsundereNoises, it's been done before. It can be done again

[00:00:46] <S_T_A_N> If it's impossible our government is broken. It's built in that we can fix this 
[00:00:49] <SummerSkies> I only even put it in such a way because it shows I am purely minding my own business and staying in my lane

[00:01:01] <TsundereNoises> there are easier ways, and literally every other way is easier
[00:01:15] <S_T_A_N> TsundereNoises, apparently we do. 
[00:01:42] <TsundereNoises> S_T_A_N: I mean, I'm inclined to say our current government is broken, but amendments being hard to remove isn't part of that, that's working as intended
[00:01:49] <TsundereNoises> and I'm inclined to think that's a vaulable intent
[00:01:54] <TsundereNoises> valuable*
[00:02:14] <Satin> SummerSkies: same
[00:02:16] <S_T_A_N> Amendments are not that hard to remove. You just have to DO it. But people are so set on being unwilling to take those steps
[00:02:37] <Satin> if they weren't hard to remove then we'd have some removed
[00:02:39] <Satin> but we don't
[00:02:44] <TsundereNoises> we have 1
[00:02:46] <TsundereNoises> prohibition
[00:02:51] <SummerSkies> you ain't takin out the 2nd i can tell ya that
[00:02:51] <Satin> lmao
[00:02:51] <MootPoot> S_T_A_N: its  more of the desire that is not sufficiently there
[00:03:01] <S_T_A_N> Satin, I am saying that difficulty is self inflicted 
[00:03:05] <Satin> for sure
[00:03:12] <MootPoot> you can go on about removing the second, but the US govt is setup to reflect the people 
[00:03:14] <SummerSkies> in the most southern fucking accent I have, I'm lettin you know that the 2nd amendment is never goin down 
[00:03:15] <TsundereNoises> the difficulty is designed into the system, and I'm arguing that's a feature not a bug

[00:03:52] <TsundereNoises> that's honestly one of the things I think our government did better than other countries
[00:03:54] <S_T_A_N> And that's my point
[00:03:59] <SummerSkies> you'd have better luck making peta eat a fucking mcdonalds chicken nugget
[00:04:01] <S_T_A_N> Thanks for coming to my TED talk
[00:04:28] <TsundereNoises> meaningful reform is rarely based on changes to the constitution, and that's BY DESIGN
[00:04:55] <TsundereNoises> although I'd like to add a few ammendments
[00:04:58] <Satin> why are they teaching fucking 5 year olds to shoot guns
[00:04:58] <TsundereNoises> which is also deliberately tough
[00:04:58] <Satin> wtf
[00:05:10] <S_T_A_N> TsundereNoises, most of the time meaningful reform is not being stopped by the constitution. 
[00:05:12] <MootPoot> Satin: pretty normal - although not the uzi part
[00:05:18] <Satin> MootPoot: wtf?
[00:05:20] <MootPoot> giving a 22 to a kid is not uncommon
[00:05:24] <Satin> wtf
[00:05:28] <TsundereNoises> S_T_A_N: and that's why I repeated myself about interpretation
[00:05:32] <TsundereNoises> the courts are important
[00:05:35] <MootPoot> I had a pellet gun when I was like 8
[00:05:44] <MootPoot> enough to pop birds
[00:05:45] <S_T_A_N> TsundereNoises, the end result of that is lack of reform
[00:05:47] <TsundereNoises> the whole courts as a check on the legistlature thing is I think one of the more clever parts of our system of government
[00:05:49] <S_T_A_N> We are already there
[00:06:01] <S_T_A_N> the courts are already lost to reasonable people

[00:06:38] <S_T_A_N> SummerSkies, that's a weird question. Hunting isn't a belief system
[00:06:49] <SummerSkies> S_T_A_N: don't worry about belief systems, I just mean in general
[00:07:00] <TsundereNoises> I do like that response to "believe in" questions though
[00:07:02] <SummerSkies> also, do you like to eat meat?
[00:07:03] <S_T_A_N> SummerSkies, ask the question you actually mean
[00:07:22] <S_T_A_N> "do you think people should have the right to hunt"
[00:07:26] <S_T_A_N> Or whatever
[00:07:39] <TsundereNoises> SummerSkies: I believe in some regulation of firearms and would also like to see an INCREASE in hunting, I think people take overly hardline stances on this on both sides

[00:08:05] <SummerSkies> the reason I ask those questions paired
[00:08:11] <TsundereNoises> I want more people to get out there and murder some fucking deer
[00:08:22] <SummerSkies> is because if you're alright with eating meat but don't want civilians to have guns
[00:08:24] <MootPoot> Satin: I'm wondering how this is news to you
[00:08:30] <SummerSkies> you're fueling the meat industry
[00:08:41] <SummerSkies> I'm not even in the god damned mood to unpack why that's bad
[00:08:48] <Satin> MootPoot: it's just extreme to be teaching kids like that
[00:08:51] <TsundereNoises> at the same time, limits on rate of fire don't interfer with that
[00:08:51] <SummerSkies> but that is one HUGE prong of importance gun rights hold
[00:08:52] <Poeticode> all us citizens should just leave the country
[00:08:53] <MootPoot> is it?
[00:08:55] <Satin> when they can't even operate cars or whatever
[00:08:56] <Satin> yeah
[00:08:57] <MootPoot> its just a 22 though
[00:08:58] <TsundereNoises> people don't hunt by mowing down whole herds of deer
[00:08:59] <SummerSkies> so if you're gonna talk about taking down guns
[00:09:02] <Satin> idk about 22 ig
[00:09:03] <SummerSkies> also address that issue, my friend
[00:09:09] <MootPoot> smol pp round
[00:09:10] <Satin> Poeticode: lol
[00:09:14] <SummerSkies> because nobodys giving up meat 
[00:09:26] <MootPoot> its the one they use in those olympic competitions
[00:09:28] <S_T_A_N> That is a odd line of logic lol
[00:09:37] <SummerSkies> it's an existing reality
[00:09:39] <TsundereNoises> Poeticode: but as a patriot, I need to stay here to complain about how much my country sucks
[00:09:40] <Satin> MootPoot: oh fair
[00:09:42] <SummerSkies> which is the only type of thing I usually consider
[00:09:53] <S_T_A_N> How much meat does the normal person eat that is "hunted" vs meat industry 
[00:10:09] <MootPoot> Satin: its pretty much good for like under 100m targets ( paper ) or bird/rabbit 
[00:10:10] <MootPoot> thats it
[00:10:13] <SummerSkies> yeah what I said doesn't encompass the whole thing, I admit that
[00:10:16] <S_T_A_N> Unless they are hunting it personally it's bacially 0%
[00:10:16] <Satin> i too, want to only eat meat i've hunted someday
[00:10:21] <SummerSkies> deer population is also a thing
[00:10:26] <TsundereNoises> ^
[00:10:29] <Satin> (that won't actually happen probably but hey)
[00:10:31] <TsundereNoises> too many damn deer
[00:10:39] <MootPoot> just drive on the highway at night - hunt deer with your car. No gun needed
[00:10:43] <MootPoot> let insurance deal with it
[00:10:43] <SummerSkies> well I meant that they don't grow on trees
[00:10:48] <SummerSkies> if everybody hunted, no more deer
[00:10:48] <Satin> MootPoot: yeah that's fair, but anyways if you watched the video
[00:10:50] <TsundereNoises> we either increase hunting, or I start cloning super wolves
[00:11:00] <Satin> you'd see how the guy is teling the news place that it's not weird for 5 year olds or such to have guns
[00:11:01] <Satin> like that
[00:11:01] <MootPoot> Satin: I knew about it the day it happened - it was a big deal
[00:11:08] <Satin> MootPoot: yikes
[00:11:11] <MootPoot> gun community was split 
[00:11:18] <Satin> training fucking kids
[00:11:19] <Satin> is whack
[00:11:23] <Satin> with anything beyond 22
[00:11:26] <Satin> imo
[00:11:27] <MootPoot> not a lot of people agree to giving uzis to kids
[00:11:34] <Satin> MootPoot: I HOPE NOT
[00:11:37] <Satin> i FUCKING HOPE NOT
[00:11:46] <S_T_A_N> Not a lot of people have uzis to give to kids lol
[00:11:54] <Satin> lol
[00:12:01] <MootPoot> although without giving uzis to kids how will we get live action gun girl anime
[00:12:20] <TsundereNoises> my earlier point is, when it comes down to the legal theory re: gun control, the NRA are complete absolutists and that opinion carries over
[00:12:25] <TsundereNoises> maybe not into the everyday community
[00:12:31] <TsundereNoises> but into talks of policy
[00:12:32] <Satin> fuck the NRA
[00:12:33] <S_T_A_N> look I just want everyone in the country to have a legally mandated p90
[00:12:35] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: not really
[00:12:45] <S_T_A_N> p90 is the only gun that matters
[00:12:46] <MootPoot> the NRA is far from a gun rights organization
[00:13:08] <MootPoot> anyone who's been into guns and not on the outside - the NRA is basically just a mouthpiece for manufacturers 
[00:13:16] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: I mean, they're increasingly mostly for the top guys to embezzle from
[00:13:16] <MootPoot> they'll accept compromises as long as they can keep selling
[00:13:20] <TsundereNoises> but that's beside the point
[00:13:24] <MootPoot> its not actually about the gun rights
[00:13:28] <MootPoot> it is EXACTLY the point
[00:13:42] <MootPoot> the NRA is no longer a gun rights organization
[00:13:54] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: in terms of politics and writing court briefs, the NRA are the ones with all the power on the gun side
[00:14:06] <TsundereNoises> it doesn't matter what you think, the power is the NRA
[00:14:12] <TsundereNoises> and in the US, lots of gun owners donate to them
[00:14:16] <MootPoot> yes, but power =/= fighting for gun rights
[00:14:22] <MootPoot> power is just power
[00:14:32] <MootPoot> you're correlating the two

[00:16:28] <Satin> Cryowolf: sounds like a scam?
[00:16:28] <TsundereNoises> that's what I was saying
[00:16:49] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: no, I'm saying that given their actions they are not a organization fighting for gun rights. You can have people thinking whatever they want

[00:18:31] <Cryowolf> well if I suddenly own property, I'm selling it
[00:18:39] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: what you seem to be saying is that because the NRA has power and money, and they are a organization that presents themselves as being all about guns, they MUST be pro-gun rights
[00:18:39] <Satin> You have your own idea of what "true" gun rights or the definition of that is
[00:18:40] <S_T_A_N> what the NRA actually does and stands for is not nessaceraly the same as what the NRA says the do and stand for or what people think they do and stand for 
[00:18:41] <Satin> which is fair
[00:19:06] <Satin> but you're not acknowledging a lot of people percieve them as fighthing for gun rights and the NRA itself thinks genuinelys o
[00:19:07] <Satin> so*
[00:19:12] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: they ARE pro gun rights in terms of their own interpretation, and that interpretation has an EXTREME amount of political power
[00:19:18] <TsundereNoises> even if it isn't what you believe
[00:19:27] <TsundereNoises> and re: the early propaganda discussion, a lot of people here buy into it
[00:19:31] <TsundereNoises> here like in my specific town
[00:19:34] <MootPoot> Satin, TsundereNoises : Yes, i do beleive that people think that, and they themsleves might think that
[00:19:58] <MootPoot> but from a legal standpoint, like how we were talking earlier - the NRA's actions do not indicate that it is a pro gun rights organization
[00:19:58] <Satin> exactly, so it's just complicating things when you confusingly say "but that's not what actual gun rights is" when the topic is about the NRA itself
[00:20:02] <Satin> it's a separate point

[00:21:09] <TsundereNoises> amicus curiae briefs, etc
[00:21:22] <MootPoot> can we all agree gun rights can be loosely defined as "facilitating the ability of the people to own and use guns"
[00:21:32] <MootPoot> because that's not what the NRA does
[00:21:50] <TsundereNoises> I would agree that that isn't really what they stand for, which was the heart of my criticism in a way
[00:21:54] <Satin> idk if i'm interested in arguing if "the NRA does actual gun rights"
[00:22:00] <Satin> i don't like the NRA in the first place
[00:22:00] <TsundereNoises> but I'm not sure that's an unambiguous definition
[00:22:10] <Satin> i'm more interesetd in why they have so much political power
[00:22:20] <Satin> and that they're ruining any attempt to make things more reasonable with gun ownership
[00:22:23] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: because, as I've said, I believe you should be able to own guns, but I also believe there are guns you shouldn't be able to own, and things like background checks, etc
[00:22:35] <MootPoot> sure, thats all fine

[00:24:11] <MootPoot> Its like how the DPRK isen't considered democratic, despite the D 
[00:24:29] <TsundereNoises> I'd agree to a point, although as a techncratic fascist, I think a lot of people just buy into the "official" position completely without actual thought

[00:29:07] <FascistNoises> hey Satin, could you pm me that video link from earlier, I can't find it and I might lose it again if you just post in main chat
[00:29:09] <Satin> yea sounds like a mistake
[00:29:28] <FascistNoises> Cryowolf: just respond back that you don't own property there
[00:29:33] <Cryowolf> maybe I can socially engineer myself a property
[00:29:36] <FascistNoises> they probably meant to email someno
[00:29:38] <Satin> Cryowolf: lol
[00:29:43] <Cryowolf> get it assigned to me and everything
[00:29:47] <Cryowolf> and end up owning pland
[00:29:50] <Cryowolf> land*
[00:29:58] <Cryowolf> then sell it
[00:30:07] <amigojapan> FascistNoises: I see. Then it is like click bait?
[00:30:31] <FascistNoises> amigojapan: yes and no, I think this state of affairs predates clickbait
[00:30:42] <FascistNoises> amigojapan: I think it's just the reporter having no clue what the fuck they are trying to read
[00:30:46] <MootPoot> jailbait
[00:30:52] <Cryowolf> Im replying asking for an explanation
[00:31:10] <FascistNoises> amigojapan: when it comes to cancer news, often it is just clickbait, but this type of science reporting is just bad in the sense of being confusing for no reason
[00:31:26] <FascistNoises> I guess saying "zombie cells" as much as they do kind of is clickbaity, but overall it's just a badly written article
[00:31:56] <Satin> Cryowolf: time to move to utah
[00:32:00] <Satin> you have some land waiting for you ;)
[00:32:11] <Satin> and mormons
[00:32:15] <Cryowolf> yes, in a town of 1600 people
[00:32:20] <Satin> lmfao
[00:32:24] <Cryowolf> maybe I can marry 7 wives
[00:32:24] <FascistNoises> Cryowolf: I mean, here the Register of Deeds (the official responsible for transferring property in the official records) is an elected position, so sometimes you can get a complete incompetent if they were elected in a wave year, could be the same there
[00:32:25] <Satin> the place i live in, is smaller than that
[00:32:28] <Satin> Cryowolf: yesyes
[00:32:47] <amigojapan> I see FascistNoises 
[00:32:53] <Satin> nvm there's like 8k people in this town
[00:32:54] <FascistNoises> so now that the supreme court legalized same sex marriage, can a woman in Utah have 7 wives?
[00:33:05] <Satin> FascistNoises: good question
[00:33:27] <Cryowolf> FascistNoises, so they managed to assign property to someone on the other side of the Atlantis ?
[00:33:28] <FascistNoises> Satin: the legal answer is no, because neither can a man, but I'd like that to happen just because of how much it would upset the right people
[00:33:31] <Cryowolf> That's some incompetence
[00:33:49] <FascistNoises> Cryowolf: alternatively they just typoed the wrong email, but sure
[00:34:04] <FascistNoises> maybe someone with a name close to yours does own property there
[00:34:32] <Cryowolf> Im not sure how thats possible with the email adress I have and my last name is fairly unusual even in Sweden
[00:34:48] <FascistNoises> I mean, don't dox yourself

[00:49:07] <ButterNoodle> I want the full Monty
[00:49:16] <ButterNoodle> def want IFR too
[00:49:19] <ButterNoodle> and multi engine
[00:49:24] <HeTo> MootPoot: it's probably 15k for the instrument rating alone
[00:49:33] <HeTo> there's no way it'd be just 3k if PPL is already 12k
[00:49:47] <OjousamaNoises> Satin: I picked this one because I'm still a bit mad though
[00:49:54] <HeTo> instrument rating requires *more* lessons than a PPL, IIRC

[00:53:45] <OjousamaNoises> amigojapan: my bigger issue is that whoever at the Japan Times wrote that, they have no idea about how science papers are written, which gives them little business writing the article on scientific research

[00:54:30] <OjousamaNoises> amigojapan: yeah, the first author is the lead researcher, the next few are usually the people they work most closely with and undergrads and whatnot, then you tack on 15 other people whose work you used in a small way or who helped you with the computer model or something
[00:55:03] <OjousamaNoises> amigojapan: honestly half the time the first author is doing grant writing and the 2nd one does more of the work, but that's not how it is officially, or how it always was

[00:55:24] <OjousamaNoises> but it's a priority thing
[00:55:33] <OjousamaNoises> so the japan times cited the least important guy
[00:55:33] <amigojapan> I see OjousamaNoises 
[00:55:45] <OjousamaNoises> which is why when I was looking him up, his research seemed unrelated to this
[00:56:35] <OjousamaNoises> amigojapan: also this is published in Nature, which is THE big science journal, that's the kind of thing you mention in an article just because it's important to how much weight this is being given by the people reviewing the research
[00:57:08] <OjousamaNoises> everyone submits papers to nature and they only publish a very small %, most get published elsewhere, so being published in Nature is newsworthy in itself, basically
[00:57:14] <OjousamaNoises> at least to the people involved
[00:57:19] <OjousamaNoises> but not mention of that in the article
[00:58:38] <amigojapan> OjousamaNoises: so if it was in nature it is news worthy after all?
[00:58:49] <OjousamaNoises> anyway, I can't read the full article without paying real money for it, but it looks like this is both a big legitimate deal, and like Japan Times was really overblowing what the actual research is so far
[00:59:19] <OjousamaNoises> amigojapan: yes, but they're reporting of it was very confusing to read because the reporter didn't know what the fuck they were writing about

[01:22:41] <Satin> I get annoyed every time i see minority weirdos in academia railing against the hold of the classics more then they need to, in literature and what not

[01:28:42] <Satin> OjousamaNoises: idk if you remember harold bloom
[01:28:53] <Satin> there are parts of his argument that i didn't really like or agree with
[01:28:56] <ButterNoodle> yea jeff bloom's cousin
[01:28:57] <OjousamaNoises> Satin: that is a GREAT image, he is making such a good face and grabbing some nice balls
[01:29:09] <Satin> but his miain overall point that literature shouldn't turn into the things he was criticizing was correct
[01:29:12] <Satin> tbh
[01:29:16] <ButterNoodle> love balls too

[01:30:24] <MootPoot> it does work for people at rock bottom
[01:30:42] <Satin> MootPoot: i'm sure there's an element of truth to some of these things, i'm not denying that. but don't get sucked up into it that it's The Truth
[01:30:56] <OjousamaNoises> stay classy ButterNoodle
[01:30:58] <Satin> and there's plenty of ways to go about life
[01:31:17] <ButterNoodle> :) thats one of my favorites
[01:31:23] <MootPoot> its not the truth; sure and I'm sure it sounds cringy to you since your POV is different
[01:31:32] <MootPoot> for a dude there are much fewer ways to validate yourself
[01:31:33] <Satin> MootPoot: it doesn't sound entirely cringy to me
[01:31:47] <OjousamaNoises> I think that's a bit at the heart of the earlier argument too, I think there's more of a The Truth to things like "how does DNA work" than "What is the correct interpretation of this book"
[01:31:49] <MootPoot> you either have a job and money, or a persona 
[01:31:50] <Satin> but regardless, the things he's packaging with are horrible
[01:32:00] <Satin> sexist bitch
[01:32:16] <MootPoot> for girls you have value without actually having accomplished anything
[01:32:25] <MootPoot> women are wonderful and all of that
[01:32:31] <OjousamaNoises> whenever people make generalizations about males, I usually feel like they are talking about experiences I have not had
[01:32:34] * Satin questionmark.png
[01:33:03] <Satin>  MootPoot: you underestimate the amount of women that are self-critical because of not accomplishing anything
[01:33:10] <Satin> or are striving for it
[01:33:12] <Satin> calm down
[01:33:15] <OjousamaNoises> I don't feel like my personal value is tied to job/money or persona really, other than to the extent that EVERYONE values their own personality
[01:33:17] <OjousamaNoises> I think
[01:33:22] <MootPoot> self critical is different then other people critical of you
[01:33:23] <OjousamaNoises> hard to know how everyone feels, obviously
[01:33:28] <MootPoot> I get that people are self critical
[01:33:37] <Satin> other people are critical about women accomplishing things too MootPoot 
[01:33:46] <MootPoot> but nobody is calling a woman a deadbeat for not making more then 30k a year
[01:33:48] <Satin> not everyone has instagram tier looks or a brand or fashion appeal or whatever
[01:33:58] <Satin> MootPoot: they certainly do
[01:34:02] <MootPoot> where
[01:34:05] <Satin> not "deadbeat" necessarily
[01:34:20] <OjousamaNoises> deadbeat is a gendered term now that I think of it
[01:34:34] <Satin> MootPoot: plenty of places? I've heard of people calling so and such women unsuccesful in hushed tones or whatever, with career or academic success or landing a good job
[01:34:40] <OjousamaNoises> women get criticized a lot for not popping out a few kids by a certain age
[01:34:45] <Satin> it's not some, like, gendered expectation these days
[01:34:47] <Satin> yeah that too
[01:35:10] <Satin> MootPoot: "modern reddit liberal women" ? certainly have a lot of fsuch criticalness directed to them just as their male collegues lol
[01:35:24] <Satin> i hate using the word "female" and "male" god
[01:35:29] <OjousamaNoises> MootPoot: actually sometime later (I have to go soon) I wanted to talk to you about… The Male Experience, to make it sound all awkward and academic
[01:35:31] <Satin> but saying "men collegues"
[01:35:50] <OjousamaNoises> I don't know, been thinking about some literary/film criticism stuff about how people engage with media
[01:35:53] <MootPoot> I dont know, I have yet to read about or witness a single instance of that ever happening
[01:36:05] <OjousamaNoises> and MootPoot I feel like you have a different perspective than me
[01:36:06] <MootPoot> I get the motherhood thing
[01:36:14] <MootPoot> I agree with you there
[01:36:18] <Satin> i see it often, especially among the liberal parts of reddit discord communities and so on lol
[01:36:27] <Satin> and irl friends who are young and studying and stuff
[01:36:49] <Satin> with equality, comes more judgement over how much money u make apparently and how suscessful in career you are
[01:36:52] <MootPoot> I dont join edgy discord groups so maybe ymmv
[01:36:53] <Satin> idk how else to summarize that
[01:37:01] <Satin> these are not edgy discord groups
[01:37:12] <OjousamaNoises> Sometimes I feel like there's this whole male experience that everyone agrees on but me
[01:37:13] <Satin> very mainstream subreddit ones with women who are 20-40
[01:37:21] <Satin> OjousamaNoises: stay the way you are
[01:37:26] <OjousamaNoises> also weird shit that academics want to project about castration anxiety, THANKS FREUD
[01:37:29] <MootPoot> but the default value of a female does seem to be higher - but occasionally guys can break it if they are exceptionally good looking or loaded
[01:37:32] <MootPoot> seems like to me
[01:37:39] <Satin> "value" in what way
[01:37:44] <Satin> what context are we talking about
[01:37:45] <MootPoot> importance 
[01:37:51] <ButterNoodle> their kidneys
[01:37:52] <Satin> is this some sexual marketplace shit
[01:37:57] <MootPoot> kind of 
[01:38:02] <MootPoot> probably related now that I think about it
[01:38:11] <Satin> social value? are you just saying this because of your social circumstances
[01:38:21] <Satin> and your age range
[01:38:25] <MootPoot> not really, I mean, I grew up in a all female environment
[01:38:25] <OjousamaNoises> I don't understand how we're measuring value of people really
[01:38:30] <Satin> do you know how women 10 years older than you are judged
[01:38:34] <MootPoot> yes
[01:39:04] <MootPoot> I get the motherhood and looks things, but I said "default value" not "value at a certain specific age group"
[01:39:07] * Satin raised eyebrows
[01:39:16] <ButterNoodle> nice
[01:39:17] <Satin> wtf does "value" mean in this context
[01:39:23] <ButterNoodle> good riddance to aquatope
[01:39:25] <Satin> can you elaborate
[01:39:25] <MootPoot> how socially protected you are
[01:39:27] <ButterNoodle> ep 24
[01:39:29] <Jigsy> This is an eyebrow raising free zone.
[01:39:33] <Satin> what is social protection mootpooters

[01:39:42] <Satin> social reputation? presitige?

[01:39:59] <amigojapan> MootPoot: everyone is valuable
[01:40:00] <Satin> standards?
[01:40:00] <MootPoot> image and privledge
[01:40:16] <Satin> MootPoot: you're not going to argue that women have more privilege now are you
[01:40:21] <ButterNoodle> white girl privilege
[01:40:23] <MootPoot> we literally have a defined "women is wonderful effect"
[01:40:31] <MootPoot> are*
[01:40:38] <Satin> tf
[01:40:46] <MootPoot> Satin: overall - no, I think they suffer in a lot of ways going on later
[01:40:48] <ButterNoodle> in canada?
[01:40:52] <MootPoot> but just to start with
[01:41:26] <MootPoot> take for example a 6 year old boy and girl, both somehow get whacked in the face
[01:41:47] <MootPoot> who typically gets attended to faster or has longer attention given to them 
[01:41:52] <MootPoot> by randoms
[01:41:58] <OjousamaNoises> the girl gets more coddled there, but if the girl is bullied by other girls, adults are less likely to do something than the boy being bullied by other boys
[01:42:03] <OjousamaNoises> although bullying is a problem both ways
[01:42:04] <ButterNoodle> well tbh.. you wouldnt whack a 6 yo girl in the face as hard as a 6 yo boy..
[01:42:09] <MootPoot> ^^^
[01:42:15] <OjousamaNoises> we treat physical bullying differently
[01:42:22] <MootPoot> see, both of you kind of demonstrated it 
[01:42:28] <MootPoot> either they get coddled more, or you treat them nicer
[01:42:39] <Satin> now, can you tie how we treat boys and girls as young as 6
[01:42:48] <MootPoot> tie?
[01:42:49] <Satin> to how women have "privilege" in society
[01:42:53] <Satin> tie to*
[01:43:00] <ButterNoodle> grade school girls suffer more emotionally than boys when it comes to bullying
[01:43:10] <ButterNoodle> more from emotional*
[01:43:11] <OjousamaNoises> MootPoot: what I mean is, a bunch of shitty 12 year olds telling someone to kill themselves get less punishment than punching someone, and in a way that's worse for girls but in a different way it's worse for boys
[01:43:19] <MootPoot> Satin: where are you going with this
[01:43:25] <OjousamaNoises> MootPoot: on one hand, unpunished bully dominance, on the other school-prison pipeline
[01:43:28] <ButterNoodle> they dont Satin
[01:43:46] <ButterNoodle> there are different standards and expectations
[01:43:53] <OjousamaNoises> and the basics of that go down to a shockingly young age in how we punish kids in school
[01:44:29] <ButterNoodle> like an engineer that worked for me.. she made less money than someone with comparable skill and experience
[01:44:30] <Satin> MootPoot: you claimed they have social privilege, i'm asking how they have that. You had an example of how bullying is treated differently among 6 year olds
[01:44:37] <OjousamaNoises> also male-on-male bullying tends to have more of a way for the victim to attempt to fight back, which I think has a psychological impact
[01:44:52] <Satin> now i'm asking, how is that relevant or how does it apply to women in general
[01:44:59] <ButterNoodle> was treated different.. like no dead hooker jokes or anime tiddies
[01:45:10] <OjousamaNoises> so I don't think the bullying is clearly better for one or the other, it's shitty in different ways
[01:45:11] <ButterNoodle> that didnt stop one guy tho..
[01:45:22] <OjousamaNoises> but the boy bullying problem we're taking more steps to fix (and fucking p)
[01:45:26] <MootPoot> Satin: its not relavant, because you keep on trying to strech it to women in general
[01:45:39] <MootPoot> and I explcitly said I'm just talking about default starting points
[01:45:41] <ButterNoodle> I love women tho
[01:45:50] <ButterNoodle> they smell nice
[01:45:50] <Satin> so default starting points are about kids
[01:45:51] <ButterNoodle> mostly
[01:45:54] <MootPoot> yes

[01:47:39] *** Parts: buZz (~buzz@sky.thebigblue.tk) ()
[01:47:46] <OjousamaNoises> Satin: I think our sort of weird "it's unfair that someone else got help" philosophy is one of our biggest societal problems
[01:47:49] <MootPoot> but anyway - point is that I think the genders have default social advantages ( generally ) and the female side isen't really brought up as much
[01:48:01] <MootPoot> I know life sucks for everyone in different ways
[01:48:21] <OjousamaNoises> MootPoot: do you think that's equally true of gay kids?
[01:48:42] <ButterNoodle> damn
[01:48:46] <Satin> "they're making eneuchs, estrogen laden, probably feed them soy too. They're creating eunuchs for the deep state"
[01:48:48] <Satin> LOL
[01:48:54] <ButterNoodle> they even have a single mom on aquatope
[01:48:57] <MootPoot> idk, gay kids arent really big enough of a population ( if they even exist ) to change the "generally" so 
[01:48:59] <MootPoot> meh
[01:49:06] <OjousamaNoises> why does the deep state need soibois?
[01:49:11] <ButterNoodle> I love lesbians tho
[01:49:46] <MootPoot> A woman pointing at a example of toxic masculinity and going "yeah this is cringe" sounds to be like a rich dude going "just dont be poor"
[01:49:48] <OjousamaNoises> MootPoot: I mean I think it matters because it clarifies what is really about gender and what is about something else
[01:50:04] <ButterNoodle> I tried to enroll in kentucky southern scissor semenaries.. but I couldnt scissor good enough
[01:50:08] <Satin> you're generallizing too much
[01:50:15] <ButterNoodle> while we are on this topic
[01:50:16] <Satin> MootPoot: it's not like there's detailed analysis about this stuff
[01:50:30] <Satin> or feminist authors that have put in the effort to talk about it with greater detail than just "lol cringe"
[01:50:30] <Jigsy> "Pick yourself up by your bootstraps."
[01:50:44] <Jigsy> Which I'm guessing is just another way of saying "Hang yourself."
[01:50:49] <Satin> it's a problem for us all, we live in a society

[01:51:09] <Satin> toxic masculinity sucks
[01:51:14] <ButterNoodle> what chall thing about that one trans girl competing on the girls swim team that literally smoked all the girls competing
[01:51:15] <OjousamaNoises> Jigsy: I thought it was instructing me to go back in time twice to become both my own father and my own mother
[01:51:26] <MootPoot> overall I think the genders have different points in their lives where they are privldeged over the other in my view
[01:51:32] <MootPoot> women have it easy as kids
[01:51:38] <ButterNoodle> *Lia Thomas
[01:51:40] <MootPoot> men easier as teens and young adults
[01:51:48] <Jigsy> One woman used her pussy pass the other day to get out of a DUI.
[01:51:49] <Satin> ButterNoodle: it's an issue, and hopefully good regulation will come over it, but it's sad that trans people participating in sports is used for purely transphobic purposes
[01:51:57] <Satin> if the debate/conversation was being done in good faith
[01:52:15] <OjousamaNoises> ButterNoodle: Not sure what my opinion is, other than sports doesn't reflect bigger society
[01:52:17] <Satin> by people who started from the premise of accepting trans people exist in the first place, then it would make more sense you get me?

[01:52:26] <Satin> but it's not
[01:52:58] <ButterNoodle> I'm all for inclusion.. but its kinda the think that was brought up w Olympic weight lifter girl.
[01:52:59] <Satin> the people who bring up this shit, on discord, or social media or politicans almost always are using it, not from a starting basis of "trans rights exist but we should work on this to be fair"
[01:53:16] <OjousamaNoises> it'd be nice if there were enough trans kids to have 4 total divisions, but that doesn't make practical sense
[01:53:24] <OjousamaNoises> I don't know what a good practical solution is
[01:53:32] <ButterNoodle> me either
[01:53:36] <Satin> it's fearmongering "trans people are taking over, look at how they're raiding our schools and sports with men pretending to be women"
[01:53:42] <Satin> or "women pretending to be men"
[01:53:45] <ButterNoodle> naaa
[01:53:48] <Satin> the dialogue is not in good faith at all
[01:53:58] <OjousamaNoises> also what Satin said
[01:54:13] <Satin> trust me, i know this because i've talked/debated with these sort of people firsthand
[01:54:20] <Satin> and i know enough politicans saying this shit xd
[01:54:29] <MootPoot> for the feminist things - I dont think female feminist authors are able to provide a good reason or strategy against toxic masculinity - I'd stretch that to liberals in general
[01:54:35] <OjousamaNoises> yeah I don't think that's what ButterNoodle is saying, but it IS how a lot of people treat it
[01:54:39] <OjousamaNoises> which makes it even tougher to talk about
[01:54:44] <MootPoot> since they dont understand why people even like joe rogan or jordan peterson to begin with
[01:54:54] <MootPoot> its just so far removed from their mindset
[01:55:04] <ButterNoodle> even some of the far right shit I was reading didnt venture into that territory. it cant if it wants to stay relevant to readers that matter. talking about it in an echo chamber does nothing for understanding acceptance and being able to relate
[01:55:05] <OjousamaNoises> there are some really sensitive discussions that I wish it were easier to have than it is

[01:55:50] <OjousamaNoises> fair
[01:56:04] <ButterNoodle> people just be people, and let people be people too
[01:56:25] <MootPoot> Satin: I have to walk 200m in 2 feet deep snow to go get the mail
[01:56:27] <MootPoot> I dont wanna
[01:56:40] <Satin> MootPoot: you're underestimating the amount of feminist critiques that exist and stuff
[01:56:41] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: just get ur polar bear to do it
[01:56:45] <Satin> i'm sure a bunch don't get it
[01:56:49] <Satin> but read what's out there first
[01:56:57] <MootPoot> I have read a few, and they very much dont get it
[01:57:05] <Satin> it's not like all of them are stuck up delusional extremely idealistic ivory tower people or anything
[01:57:09] <MootPoot> although most of the ones I've encountered are pop feminism types
[01:57:11] <Satin> there's many who are about finding nuance as well
[01:57:15] <Satin> yea pop feminism types suck
[01:57:41] <Jigsy> Mom & Pop Feminism?
[01:57:51] <ButterNoodle> I do feel, as with every topic, there are some wild ass extreme views on whatever topic.. I was gonna say I dont think that its the mindset of most people.
[01:57:54] <OjousamaNoises> Satin: I keep wanting to complain about how stupid some given feminist critique is, but then kind of can't because I also don't want it to be like "lol, dumb feminists" when my real issue I want to talk about is "penis envy is not a universal experience, stop worshiping freud"
[01:58:08] <Satin> there is feminist critique for sure
[01:58:24] <OjousamaNoises> Satin: it's either "shut up, you can't disagree because that means you hate IDENTITY or yeah, fuck those sjws"
[01:58:34] <MootPoot> penis envy is one thing, but GPU envy is where its at these days
[01:58:35] <OjousamaNoises> I just want to argue about weird academic BS
[01:58:35] <Satin> yeah lol
[01:58:39] <ButterNoodle> socially we try to find people to relate topics to.. thats where the echo chamber effect comes in.. then the dick measuring starts as who can be the loudest on the topic
[01:59:10] <MootPoot> I've stopped taking the time to read feminist critiques and stuff - stopped doing a it a while ago
[01:59:18] <MootPoot> so maybe things have changed
[01:59:23] <Satin> wtf were you even reading
[01:59:34] <MootPoot> but from last time - thats just my takeaway
[01:59:36] <Satin> i'm not talking about jezebel or guardian articles or whatever moronic slate articles
[01:59:37] <ButterNoodle> I get all the news that matters on slickdeals
[01:59:46] <MootPoot> Satin: I dont remember my stuff from 3-4 years ago, sorry
[01:59:47] <OjousamaNoises> ButterNoodle: I mean there are a lot of times where I'm mad about some dumb thing, I want to find someone on the internet who agrees with me just to know I'm not alone
[01:59:53] <Satin> actual books exist :^)
[01:59:56] <OjousamaNoises> but I often seem to be alone as far as I can tell
[02:00:06] <Satin> MootPoot: get into philosophy/literautre desu

[02:00:14] <Satin> yes.
[02:00:16] <Satin> yes.
[02:00:16] <MootPoot> that means I'll have to rearead kokoro
[02:00:16] <Satin> yes.

[02:00:20] <MootPoot> its boring
[02:00:24] <Satin> you don't have to re-read kokoro
[02:00:30] <Satin> i deeply enjoyed it but you don't have to
[02:00:38] <Satin> it's ok to find things boring
[02:00:45] <OjousamaNoises> Men, Women, and Chainsaws is a really interesting book, author is like 40% full of shit and 60% throwing out really interesting ideas, but at least it's really engaging

[02:11:37] <OjousamaNoises> MootPoot, Satin: do you think authors should write about experiences that are not their own?
[02:11:39] <MootPoot> Satin: you can criticize a choice - that's fine, its more of the whole "just dont be poor" style of criticism
[02:11:40] <Satin> but men can have opinions on abortion as well in my opinion, as long as it's not obviously fucking....authoritian or whatever

[02:12:40] <MootPoot> I think its a grey line

[02:13:01] <Satin> OjousamaNoises: obviously when it's say, something as sensitive as race relations and what not, can some white person really claim they understand black culture perspectives

[02:13:11] <Satin> i deal with too much ignorance online with the average person
[02:13:12] <ButterNoodle> I've been thinking about a machine
[02:13:21] <OjousamaNoises> there is a lot of, to my mind, really stupid arguing about who has the right to write about what kindo f story
[02:13:23] <MootPoot> but I dont think I'll stretch is to saying as you can go into somebody else's exprience
[02:13:24] <OjousamaNoises> I find it very frustrating

[02:13:31] <MootPoot> Satin: hey!
[02:13:34] <Satin> OjousamaNoises: at the same time though, quality of reasoning isn't boosted just because of your identity
[02:13:34] <OjousamaNoises> also people have bizarre opinions on how well off the average aspiring author is
[02:13:40] <Satin> yeah

[02:14:28] <Satin> OjousamaNoises: remember even some White Male European Authors who had great depictions and insight into what women dealt with and how it was like for them
[02:14:28] <OjousamaNoises> Satin: I've legitimately seen the argument that white people should submit fewer stories for publication because they shouldn't write about minorities but there isn't enough minority representation
[02:14:33] <Satin> even if their actions weren't like that directly
[02:14:34] <S_T_A_N> still annoying for something so expensive 
[02:14:38] <Satin> like Leo Tolstoy
[02:14:44] <OjousamaNoises> also I hate when things are phrased as "does violence to" when things are non violent

[02:22:48] <OjousamaNoises> or whatever they even mean by that
[02:22:52] <Satin> k i d s
[02:22:53] <OjousamaNoises> because I can't quite tell
[02:23:03] <Satin> also twitter is a horrible place for discourse
[02:23:07] <OjousamaNoises> yeah

[02:23:18] <Satin> pls
[02:23:24] <OjousamaNoises> I'm not sure it's possible for madness to die down on twitter, it's made for nuance-free mob mentality
[02:23:29] <OjousamaNoises> the madness can at best change I think
[02:23:36] <Satin> i want detailed exchaneges pls
[02:23:37] <OjousamaNoises> I MISS FORUMS
[02:23:43] <OjousamaNoises> I don't know why forums have gone away so much
[02:23:51] <OjousamaNoises> all the forums I used to use are dead in terms of actual discussion
[02:23:54] <Satin> i was born in 1999, not even the age of forums
[02:23:55] <OjousamaNoises> people move to twitter or discord
[02:24:00] <OjousamaNoises> but those aren't replacing them!
[02:24:00] <Satin> but i saw old forum threads and almost dying forum threads
[02:24:09] <Satin> and lived there for gaming stuff and such in the early 2010s
[02:24:30] <Satin> discord is an incredibly mixed bag but

[02:24:37] <Satin> twitter is awful
[02:24:37] <OjousamaNoises> Satin: one I really miss is there used to be forums for many different short story magazines, so there could be a thread for each story, and even if you read the magazine months later, you could go in a thread and talk about that one story
[02:24:44] <Satin> heh
[02:24:50] <OjousamaNoises> all the modern stuff, including reddit, is just terrible for that sort of interaction
[02:24:52] <OjousamaNoises> it's only the NEW
[02:24:57] <OjousamaNoises> and no actual time to discuss
[02:25:00] <Satin> reddit is also a hivemind

[02:25:14] <OjousamaNoises> yeah but I mean it's also designed terribly for discussion

[02:25:36] <OjousamaNoises> but yeah, it does lead itself to blind leading the blind and voices of reason getting downvoted until they leave
[02:25:40] <Satin> or accomodating the wide rangingness of communities and what people are looking for
[02:26:20] <Satin> part of the mistake of social media is everything being globbed onto one huge platform

[02:26:33] <Satin> and all the trash that comes with it mixed with nice parts

[02:55:52] <MootPoot> >The term dream pop is thought to relate to the "immersion" in the music experienced by the listener.[10] The AllMusic Guide to Electronica (2003) defined dream pop as "an atmospheric subgenre of alternative rock that relies on sonic textures as much as melody".[11] According to Paste, the genre emphasizes mood and sonics over lyrics, so that "chords and tracks blur seamlessly into one another so frequently that it can be difficult to even 
[02:55:52] <MootPoot> decipher when one song ended and another has begun."[12] Common characteristics are breathy vocals, the use of guitar effects, and a densely produced sound,[11] with "nebulous, distorted guitars" paired with "murmured vocals sometimes completely smudged into a wall of noise.

It is often denoted using the percent sign, "%", although the abbreviations "pct.", "pct" and sometimes "pc" are also used. A percentage is a dimensionless number; it has no unit of measurement.

[17:44:04] <Sadale> Mellowlink, the -slav suffix tho
[17:44:16] <Sadale> coincidently it reminds me of slave :(
[17:44:19] <darkwitch> again, when did swastika become a peace symbol?
[17:44:27] <amigojapan> Mellowlink: it's not a peace symbol. It's the symbol for Buddhist temple

[18:10:05] <amigojapan> DaPinkOne: there is also a hand writing test which requires you to write an essay on the spot while being supervised and you need to use more than a certain amount of Kanji, written by hand. I don't think I can pass that

[18:14:57] <DaPinkOne> Urchin[emacs], we can count pretty high with binary already. why base 12?

[18:16:08] <TsundereNoises> exactly!
[18:16:28] <amigojapan> DaPinkOne: according to that year, at the time I knew 1600 Kanji

[18:16:49] <DaPinkOne> TsundereNoises, you've got two arms. could use arms and feet/legs as additional bits. that's 4 more bits
[18:17:19] <Sadale> Actually we've got upper and lower arms.
[18:17:27] <TsundereNoises> DaPinkOne: you must have really good control of your toes
[18:17:35] <TsundereNoises> oh, legs
[18:17:37] *** Quits: basuotoko (~basuotoko@171.94.16.249) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[18:17:37] <DaPinkOne> TsundereNoises, i'm not suggesting use of toes :/
[18:17:39] *** basuotoko_ is now known as basuotoko
[18:17:44] <Urchin[emacs]> DaPinkOne: base 12 is neat because it uses a highly composite number, so you have much divisors
[18:17:47] <Sadale> So each arm would be two bits. Similarly, each leg would be two bits. That'd mean 8 additional bits coming from arms and legs.
[18:17:52] <DaPinkOne> i'm usually wearing shoes, which discounts the use of toes
[18:18:06] <Urchin[emacs]> DaPinkOne: also, it more easily represents common fractions
[18:18:12] <TsundereNoises> what arm positions are we talking about?
[18:18:18] <Sadale> each sole would be a bit. All toes would make a bit as well. Now that we'd have 4 additional bits
[18:18:20] <DaPinkOne> Sadale, i'm trying to imagine how you would use both the upper and lower arm without at some point trying to break your elbow
[18:18:39] <amigojapan> Urchin[emacs]: I doubt that will change
[18:18:40] <Urchin[emacs]> DaPinkOne: Romans used twelfths for fractions
[18:18:42] <TsundereNoises> I guess if you only need to count the one time...
[18:18:57] <Sadale> DaPinkOne, good question.
[18:19:30] <DaPinkOne> Urchin[emacs], if we were trying to make it easy for fractions, 12 or 60 seems reasonable
[18:19:58] <TsundereNoises> base 60 doesn't seem reasonable to me
[18:20:10] <amigojapan> DaPinkOne: some couriers use that in clocks
[18:20:16] <Sadale> Actually, we could just use our arms like a couple of clocks. Each clock would be divided into 12 directions.
[18:20:27] <DaPinkOne> TsundereNoises, it works well enough for clocks. 12 is good for /3 and /4. 60 adds /5
[18:20:29] <Sadale> Each orientation/direction would be a number. That'd be 0-11.
[18:20:45] <TsundereNoises> DaPinkOne: yeah, but day-to-day human usage isn't a clock
[18:20:56] <TsundereNoises> you need to be talking about all those numbers and doing operations with them
[18:21:08] <DaPinkOne> TsundereNoises, depends what you're using it for I suppose. 
[18:21:20] <DaPinkOne> time is pretty easy for most people to grasp
[18:21:26] <TsundereNoises> I was assuming the question was "as the standard unit in a human civilization"
[18:21:36] <amigojapan> In Japan eggs are sold in packs of 10 eggs :(
[18:21:39] <TsundereNoises> we TALK about time in base 10 though
[18:21:40] <SummerSkies> i was just talking in a channel for like 10 minutes thinking i was here
[18:21:44] <TsundereNoises> kind of 
[18:21:45] <SummerSkies> i was like hey you guys are new
[18:21:46] <DaPinkOne> i think the mayans used base 60
[18:21:58] <TsundereNoises> we don't have the 58th second have a special name
[18:22:10] <TsundereNoises> and really, we don't measure much in seconds
[18:22:22] <amigojapan> DaPinkOne: base 20
[18:22:25] <TsundereNoises> SummerSkies: sorry for not being in the other channel
[18:22:27] *** Parts: badMrButt3r (~bmb@AdminRouter2C.dunn.u90.k12.me.us) (Leaving)
[18:22:56] <Urchin[emacs]> IIRC, Base 20 has some neat properties for multiplication
[18:23:05] <DaPinkOne> it wasn't the mayans, it was babylonian in mesopotamia

[18:23:20] <DaPinkOne> amigojapan, an interesting choice. why 20?
[18:23:57] <TsundereNoises> it was also the mayans
[18:24:01] <DaPinkOne> apparently it's a thing

[18:24:35] <amigojapan> DaPinkOne: dunno, maybe they counted there toes as well
[18:24:43] <Sadale> Base 10 FTW
[18:25:30] <Urchin[emacs]> Mayans used base 20, babylonians were on base 60
[18:25:37] <Sadale> now that I'm wondering what'd the world be like if a non-base 10 numeral becomes dominant in human culture
[18:25:56] <TsundereNoises> and in english, we have very unique words for the numbers up to 20 anyway
[18:25:57] <Sadale> There're so many shit in this world that's made for base 10 just because we've been using it.
[18:26:16] <Sadale> More like up to 12.
[18:26:25] <Sadale> The -teen doesn't count :P
[18:26:27] <TsundereNoises> fourteen is weird
[18:26:36] <TsundereNoises> kids have trouble with the teens
[18:26:39] <TsundereNoises> like little kids
[18:26:46] <DaPinkOne> it should be tentyfour
[18:26:47] <Sadale> ah. I thought that it was forteen xD
[18:26:51] <TsundereNoises> judging from my niece
[18:26:53] <Sadale> I'm not a native speaker tho.
[18:27:28] <DaPinkOne> i dunno why we decided to swap the order, just for the teens
[18:27:49] *** Quits: Koobrick (Koobrick@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/koobrick) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[18:27:49] <TsundereNoises> because we had more unique name for the numbers up to that point has always been my guess
[18:27:58] <TsundereNoises> I don't know
[18:28:03] <TsundereNoises> I blame the germans?
[18:28:04] <Sadale> Maybe they stole the numeral system from another language 
[18:28:05] <TsundereNoises> maybe
[18:28:34] <DaPinkOne> well, we use arabic numerals, but i'm not sure. it's possible the words predate the numbers
[18:28:36] <Sadale> Chinese numeral is rather simple
[18:28:43] <TsundereNoises> yeah, english likes to lurk in dark alleys, beating up other languages to take their words and grammar
[18:28:47] <Sadale> Far simpler than the English one. And I like it better than the English one.
[18:28:52] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: Spanish has special numbers up to 15
[18:28:55] <Urchin[emacs]> in my native language 10<n<20 all n follow the same pattern
[18:29:18] <TsundereNoises> Urchin[emacs]: that's too reasonable, get out
[18:29:39] <Urchin[emacs]> it's one of the rare aspects that's reasonable
[18:30:02] <SummerSkies> this idiot named koobrick literally watches me mention stanley kubrick and doesn't say anything
[18:30:13] <TsundereNoises> DaPinkOne: I mean, it wouldn't be our current language, but you've got to figure numbers predate roman numerals for whatever the correct ancestor language was
[18:30:16] <DaPinkOne> looks like the etymology of -teen is from old saxon/dutch/high german. it was indeed the germans
[18:30:30] <amigojapan> Urchin[emacs]: so does Japanese
[18:30:33] <TsundereNoises> the UK countries didn't have writing pre-rome, but there was math going on
[18:30:44] <Sadale> Here's how Chinese numeral works. + is like a special character for "10": 0. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, +, +1, +2, +3, +4, +5, +6, +7, +8, +9, 2+, 2+1, 2+2, 2+3, 2+4, ...
[18:31:04] <Sadale> so thirty would be 3+. thirty one would be 3+1 and so on.
[18:31:04] <TsundereNoises> DaPinkOne: called it
[18:31:26] <amigojapan> DaPinkOne: so why do we have special numbers from 11 to 15 in Spanish. Similar to English

[18:31:41] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: using the + sign made that confusing, but I get it now
[18:31:42] <Urchin[emacs]> thirty is XXX
[18:31:43] <DaPinkOne> amigojapan, I dunno.
[18:32:01] <Sadale> TsundereNoises, yeah I can't find a better symbol for that. That's because here's how the kanji looks like: 十
[18:32:47] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: I just got that it was the same as japanese after a bit, but yeah, when I see + I start wanting to add things
[18:32:48] <amigojapan> Lol darkwitch 
[18:33:07] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: honestly something like $ or # looks dumb but I feel like we don't want to do math operations with them
[18:33:26] <Sadale> hmm. true
[18:33:32] <DaPinkOne> SummerSkies, this music's pretty nice. I dig chip tunes
[18:33:53] <SummerSkies> yeah it's a DS song 
[18:33:53] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: or just use the hanzi and let anyone without chinese fonts installed suffer
[18:33:56] <Sadale> Yeah let's use "!" for 10. "@" for hundred and "#" for thousand, "$" for ten thousand.
[18:33:58] <TsundereNoises> the little box thing works too
[18:34:05] <DaPinkOne> TsundereNoises, I don't remember what it's for, but I know i've seen # as a math operator before
[18:34:23] <amigojapan> DaPinkOne: stop digging them and listen to them :)
[18:34:24] <SummerSkies> DaPinkOne: that piece of music made me realize the level of talent and education behind the composers of kirby soundtracks
[18:34:28] <Urchin[emacs]> Sadale: are you trying to reinvent roman numerals badly?
[18:34:34] <Sadale> TsundereNoises, here's the revised counting: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ! !1 !2 ... !9 2! 2!1 2!2 ... 2!9 3! ...
[18:34:43] <Sadale> Urchin[emacs], That's Chinese numeral. Not roman.
[18:34:54] <Sadale> Urchin[emacs], I'm trying to explain how Chinese numberal works.
[18:35:01] <amigojapan> SummerSkies: my son loves Kirby songs
[18:35:17] <DaPinkOne> SummerSkies, if you look into the making of old games like super mario, or kirby, they crammed a ton of brilliant design into them, because space and processing power was so limited
[18:35:33] <SummerSkies> he probably knows much newer ones than me, I haven't kept up with modern kirby games since 2010
[18:35:38] <SummerSkies> i doubt they got any less good though
[18:35:51] <SummerSkies> DaPinkOne: yeah I noticed that
[18:36:04] <Sadale> Anyway it goes all the way to 9!9 for ninetynine. Then it gets to 1@. Then it's 1@01, 1@02, 1@03, ... 1@09, 1@1!, 1@1!1, 1@1!2 ... 1@1!9 1@2!, 1@2!1, 1@2!2 ...
[18:36:10] <SummerSkies> even though the hardware power and understanding is primitive, there's still lots of professionalism and thought put into it
[18:36:24] <SummerSkies> and it shows when you play sonic ROM hacks of the genesis games
[18:36:37] <amigojapan> SummerSkies: yeah. I don't know exactly but he had probably played every Kirby game
[18:36:38] <DaPinkOne> Set theory. that's where i've seen # from
[18:37:08] <Sadale> Actually what if we just spell out the digits for conveying the numbers?
[18:37:16] <SummerSkies> the cool thing is occaisionally fans with game making skill actually get behind a sonic ROM hack and it ends up being as good as the games
[18:37:35] <Sadale> Instead of saying nine hundreds and thirty five, why not just say nine-three-five?
[18:37:35] <SummerSkies> amigojapan: I wouldn't doubt it considering a lot of the old ones from gameboy, NES and super NES are now available digitally on the switch
[18:37:39] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: I mean at least for me I feel like just using the chinese counters would be easier
[18:37:40] <SummerSkies> which excites me, I should buy them
[18:37:58] <DaPinkOne> Sadale, sometimes people do.
[18:38:13] <Sadale> yes. Not that common tho.
[18:38:27] <DaPinkOne> it's pretty common for things like zip codes and phone numbers
[18:38:31] <TsundereNoises> I think it works better for reading out loud, you get a scale of the magnitude right away
[18:38:36] <Sadale> At least you won't just spell out the digits for pricetag
[18:38:46] <TsundereNoises> if you are talking about a big number and you start listing off numbers, it's hard to know how big the number is
[18:38:59] <Sadale> true. That's a problem :(
[18:39:05] <TsundereNoises> one three five two two two one
[18:39:22] <amigojapan> SummerSkies: the NES ones, we own an pocket NES emulator that's really good. You insert Famicom games(half size of NES) and it's like a game boy
[18:39:25] <TsundereNoises> vs one million three hundred fifty two thousand two hundred twenty one
[18:39:26] <Sadale> So we only need to know the number of digits.
[18:39:44] <Sadale> Why not this then? seven digits, one thre five two two two one.
[18:39:46] <DaPinkOne> that's only really important if the recipient needs to know the size of it in advance for typesetting or something
[18:39:49] <TsundereNoises> yes, which you get from words like million or 万
[18:39:58] <Sadale> First say out the number of digits, then you spell out the digits

[18:42:44] <DaPinkOne> TsundereNoises, how do you take your coffee?
[18:43:13] <amigojapan> Urchin[emacs]: pretty intuitive
[18:43:51] <TsundereNoises> DaPinkOne: sometimes black, more often with a very small splash of milk
[18:43:52] <amigojapan> DaPinkOne: I take my coffee using my hands :)
[18:43:56] *** SummerSkies is now known as murthysucks
[18:44:06] <TsundereNoises> DaPinkOne: depends on the coffee
[18:44:20] *** murthysucks is now known as SummerSkies
[18:44:47] <TsundereNoises> in most coffees, I like a bit of milk, but it's also easy to have too much milk
[18:44:52] <SummerSkies> nevermind that
[18:45:00] <DaPinkOne> too much milk makes it bad :(
[18:45:07] <TsundereNoises> and i'd rather too little than too much
[18:45:09] <TsundereNoises> yeah exactly
[18:45:28] <DaPinkOne> sometimes it's shitty /too strong coffee, so I water it down a little
[18:45:33] <amigojapan> I like cafe latte
[18:45:58] <TsundereNoises> only exception is really really shitty coffee, like late night convenience store or shitty motel "continental breakfast"
[18:46:16] <TsundereNoises> if the coffee is REALLY bad, my trick is to empty one of those also shitty instant hot chocolate packets into it
[18:46:28] <DaPinkOne> that sounds good
[18:46:44] <TsundereNoises> it would ruin good coffee, but it makes terrible coffee acceptable
[18:46:47] <DaPinkOne> amigojapan, with your hands? not with a straw?
[18:46:54] <DaPinkOne> you put your fingers in the cup?
[18:47:04] <amigojapan> Hehehe DaPinkOne 
[18:47:41] <DaPinkOne> i'm not a huge fan of the iced coffees, but some of the cold coffees that come in a can are alright
[18:47:50] <DaPinkOne> way sweeter than they need to be though
[18:47:54] <TsundereNoises> I love good iced coffee (in summer)
[18:47:58] <TsundereNoises> I make my own
[18:48:05] <TsundereNoises> yeah iced coffee doesn't need any sugar at all
[18:48:19] <TsundereNoises> cold brew is less bitter
[18:48:23] <amigojapan> No coffee needs act sugar
[18:48:29] <amigojapan> Sugar is evil
[18:48:31] <TsundereNoises> cold brew I drink just black
[18:48:38] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: agreed
[18:48:49] <DaPinkOne> i haven't tried coldbrew
[18:48:52] <TsundereNoises> except for cheap motel coffee
[18:48:57] <DaPinkOne> it seems like a lot of work
[18:49:06] <TsundereNoises> DaPinkOne: it's what most of the iced is here, and also it's what I make all summer
[18:49:15] <TsundereNoises> it's really not, put it in the fridge with the grounds and forget it
[18:49:26] <DaPinkOne> TsundereNoises, that requires thinking ahead...which i'm not the best at
[18:49:37] <DaPinkOne> it doesn't oversteep?
[18:49:44] <listen_ers> gotta try that southern sweet tea they have . theres a city reliegh it hosts all things open conference i hear you can grab and try the sweet tea there its unique
[18:49:48] <TsundereNoises> DaPinkOne: I have 2 pitchers, each has a fine mesh bag that I put coffee grounds in, I have one steeping while I drink the other
[18:49:54] <TsundereNoises> that's my summer system
[18:50:07] <TsundereNoises> DaPinkOne: nah, it doesn't really oversteep, it's not tea
[18:50:21] <DaPinkOne> ...I do have two pitchers, but i'm probably not ready for that quantity of coffee
[18:50:22] <TsundereNoises> generally I like to give it like 2 days at least
[18:50:47] <TsundereNoises> DaPinkOne: lol, I mean, you could just drink less coffee than me
[18:50:54] <TsundereNoises> I just like the rotating system because I always have more
[18:51:28] * SummerSkies turns super saiyan
[18:51:37] <TsundereNoises> when I had one pitcher I had to make hot coffee or something when I ran out and needed to give it time to steep for a day or so
[18:51:43] <DaPinkOne> I have one (16oz?) cup every other day or so; 
[18:52:15] <TsundereNoises> DaPinkOne: so when I think I'm not drinking too much coffee I drink 4 times as much coffee as you
[18:52:16] <DaPinkOne> it's hard to concentrate and do work without some kind of caffeine 
[18:52:43] <TsundereNoises> anyway, the two pitcher system was revolutionary for me, it's like the invention of crop rotation
[18:53:24] <amigojapan> I probably like a lot of milk in my coffee tho
[18:53:38] <DaPinkOne> so these paper bags for steeping. how's that work?
[18:53:54] <TsundereNoises> DaPinkOne: I don't know, I don't use paper, I use a reusable mesh bag
[18:54:05] <TsundereNoises> DaPinkOne: I think it's nylon?
[18:54:10] <DaPinkOne> hmm
[18:54:20] <DaPinkOne> amigojapan, the milk really helps balance the acidity
[18:54:28] <listen_ers> paper you can reuse
[18:54:34] <listen_ers> as long as you dont puncture it
[18:54:39] <TsundereNoises> DaPinkOne: and I'm not actually sure where it came from, fiancee got it for me, but I could ask
[18:54:46] <TsundereNoises> listen_ers: not when you soak it in water
[18:54:58] <TsundereNoises> yeah, I think some coffees want more milk than others
[18:55:13] <TsundereNoises> and some roasts really
[18:55:24] <listen_ers> it dries out how i make coffee cause i dont use a machine or nothing i just have it over some upcycle object then i make my coffee
[18:55:35] <TsundereNoises> I prefer light roasts, but I think I'd probably use more milk if I mostly drank dark roasts
[18:56:02] <DaPinkOne> I've mostly gotten medium-dark roasts. I'll have to try a lighter roast
[18:56:08] <TsundereNoises> I really like them
[18:56:09] <Sadale> time to sleep :3
[18:56:10] <listen_ers> well i use to use rubber bands but then the pull strings from a mower works nicer

[20:15:00] <isekaijin> Sadale: Base 12 (for normies) or base 16 (for programmers) would be a lot more convenient than base 10.
[20:18:41] <listen_ers> it could be any base actually theres a lot more too it like place holder the place holder would be the multiplication
[20:19:11] <listen_ers> i m guessing theres some systems with no zero

[21:12:05] <TsundereNoises> it's always weird to read reviews that start with "I don't like this entire genre of things to which the reviewed thing belongs."

[22:03:39] <MootPoot> I'll have a unemployment holiday then 
[22:03:56] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I'm setting up a new computer like Sunday and will be jumping around trying to decide on a distro
[22:04:06] <TsundereNoises> I'll be happy to commiserate
[22:04:09] <Satin> what have you been using so far?
[22:04:26] <MootPoot> Win10 with WSL :3
[22:04:41] <TsundereNoises> bunsenlabs on one, puppy on another, but I've been making old computers keep working
[22:04:45] <Satin> i see
[22:04:46] <TsundereNoises> time to actually have a real computer
[22:04:47] <Satin> MootPoot: no
[22:05:15] <TsundereNoises> satin: so now I have a real computer, once I have a monitor that works with it I just need to set it up
[22:05:16] <MootPoot> Satin: yes-
[22:05:19] <TsundereNoises> but I'm spending saturday cleaning
[22:05:22] <TsundereNoises> hooray cleaning
[22:05:30] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: oh did you get a actual computer finally 
[22:05:35] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: yeah
[22:05:40] <MootPoot> Amazing 
[22:05:44] <MootPoot> How does it feel 
[22:05:51] <TsundereNoises> I don't know, weird
[22:05:56] <TsundereNoises> and I'm not acutally using it yet
[22:06:12] <TsundereNoises> but it feels strange, soon I'll have a non-ancient computer
[22:06:24] <TsundereNoises> the anticipation is exciting
[22:06:55] <MootPoot> Soon?
[22:06:58] <MootPoot> I thought you had it 
[22:07:07] <TsundereNoises> yeah but I also ordered a new monitor
[22:07:09] <TsundereNoises> which isn't here yet
[22:07:13] <MootPoot> Is it just lying around?
[22:07:16] <MootPoot> Ah
[22:07:16] <TsundereNoises> yeah
[22:07:27] <TsundereNoises> thought maybe it was time to move on from crt monitor
[22:08:13] <TsundereNoises> also I desperately need to clean my office, but to do that I really need to clean my dining room/living room/the one with the table in it
[22:08:24] <TsundereNoises> and figure that may as well be part of the process
[22:09:00] <TsundereNoises> I'm probably making this a bigger deal than it is, but it FEELS like it should be a big deal
[22:09:15] <TsundereNoises> I haven't had a new new computer since like 2004 or so

[22:16:06] <MootPoot> Right now I'm just stick getting something to install on it 
[22:16:13] <MootPoot> It's actually industrial surplus 
[22:16:24] <MootPoot> A board of this spec new would be like 220
[22:16:28] <MootPoot> I got it for 40
[22:16:48] <MootPoot> Quad core Intel atom with 2gb of ram and built in wifi  and BT 
[22:17:46] <MootPoot> So if I can get it working for the price might as well get more 
[22:18:04] <MootPoot> And yes TsundereNoises I'm at that point with computers that I'll pick one up just because

[22:20:16] <MootPoot> Those AIOs are like 200+
[22:20:26] <MootPoot> AMD ones even more 
[22:20:39] <listen_ers> i think they quit producing them actually

[22:22:59] <listen_ers> its not bad
[22:23:13] <listen_ers> the four core atom 2 ram is powerful true

[22:24:26] <TsundereNoises> Hey, I lost power
[22:24:33] <TsundereNoises> didn't see anything after "just because"
[22:25:27] <listen_ers> well arm and atom the atom is going to lose if you want portability AIO mimicks a desktop cause of sleekness. my atom laptops are good 'station' laptops. but if you want to try atom boards thats new territory
[22:26:43] <listen_ers> i cant imagine getting a better deal that aftermarket dell AIO cause its just the board you are paying for rather then getting a monitor and maybe the keyboard and mouse they ship with
[22:27:14] <MootPoot> How much did you pay for this AIO
[22:27:32] <listen_ers> i talk the previous owner down to a hundred bucks cause i didnt need it and she agrees
[22:27:42] <MootPoot> I don't want a desktop computer, I'm only interested in headless systems
[22:27:44] <listen_ers> basically brand new
[22:27:53] <listen_ers> the mouse and keyboard had no wear

[22:30:59] <MootPoot> For 40 bucks you aren't getting much in the ARM system world 
[22:31:05] <MootPoot> Try at least 70 
[22:32:34] <listen_ers> well i cant be buying it cause my purposesarent serious enough
[22:32:36] <MootPoot> And that board will be 2 or 3x slower then this one

[22:45:41] <Satin> the wifi icon disappeared, and in PopOS settings it says wifi adapter unavailable
[22:46:02] <Satin> I have no idea. I booted into Windows out away from Linux last night, downloaded some game, then shut my pc entirely down
[22:46:06] <Satin> reboot into linux this morning
[22:46:08] <Satin> that's the case

[22:47:33] <TsundereNoises> I feel like being able to whine is helpful by itself
[22:47:42] <TsundereNoises> actually I think there's research to that effect
