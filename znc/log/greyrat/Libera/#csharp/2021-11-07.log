[01:57:41] <biberu> XJ8: declaring it as public means that other code might start to rely on it, if it's public on a public class that might mean code in other projects, possibly written by other people, and that might make it hard to change later on
[02:00:58] <XJ8> There's 6 different access levels in C#. For best practices, what should I default to for everything and change it when issues pop up.

[02:08:08] <biberu> XJ8: wouldn't look for a default, would look for the right one to use depending on the context
[02:08:46] <biberu> XJ8: e.g. by making something fully public you're making a promise to the rest of the world that they can use this thing, is that what you want?
[02:09:12] <biberu> XJ8: or are you using inheritance and want to make it available to subclasses?
[02:09:45] <biberu> XJ8: or do you want to make it available to anything in the same assembly (and possibly tests)?
[02:10:24] <biberu> XJ8: it's generally easier to make things more visible, as you won't be breaking any promises by doing that, the other way can be harder to do later on
[02:10:47] <XJ8> I'm trying to get a grasp on good practices. Like I said,  there are 6 different access levels (Private, Public, Internal, and 3 -Protected) it would help to know which would be better to start off with.
[02:13:14] <biberu> did you look up the language defaults?
[02:13:39] <XJ8> I get that a lot of stuff defaults to private
[02:13:58] <XJ8> but for code clarity, I should specify the access level myself.
[02:18:25] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Not sure i get why people hate DST so much
[02:18:45] <MizMahem> the default is `internal`actually, I think.
[02:19:41] <MizMahem> default for classes that is, and private for its members. I agree it's usually best to specify though, but styles differ.
[02:22:34] <biberu> XJ8: if you want to be explicit shouldn't it also clarify your intent? if you're overriding the default in some situation shouldn't there be a reason? does "nah, i default to private protected" make sense as a reason?
[02:24:01] <Suchiman> Nasp: always having to look up the current UTC offset
[02:24:09] <biberu> that said i'm always explicit about it, but i don't have a "default", what visibility that should be used depends on the context

If it is, subtract the segment length from N and take that distance along the second segment.

I want to make a game using an engine that has C# bindings like monogame, unity, or godot. This is a game, not a library, so would private by default fit this scenario better?
[16:12:47] <Suchiman> XJ8: well, the first thing is accessibility on classes, the class can be internal (default if nothing is specified, e.g. when you just write `class Foo { }`) and public, where public means visible outside of the current assembly (dll or exe) and internal is not visible outside the assembly
[16:14:32] *** Joins: blez (~blez@213.91.182.96)
[16:15:16] <Suchiman> XJ8: for methods on classes, whether they're public, private or protected depends on if this is a method that the user of the class is supposed to invoke, then it must be public. If this method only serves to perform tasks internal to the class that are triggered by other (public?) methods if your class, then they should be private. If you're using inheritance and the behavior of any of these methods that perform internal tasks needs to be
[16:15:16] <Suchiman> modified, they would be (virtual) and protected instead of private
[16:17:16] <Suchiman> if you do not specify a visibility on a method (e.g. `void Test() { }`, methods default to private, if you do not explicitly have a reason to make the method public, they should be private
[16:17:38] <XJ8> Will do

[17:21:16] <lz__> bomb: https://it.slashdot.org/story/14/01/16/2132253/microsoft-remotely-deleted-tor-from-windows-machines-to-stop-botnet
[17:21:28] <lz__> biberu: see that link, I'm not crazy
[17:21:35] <biberu> checking
[17:22:10] <lz__> https://www.dailydot.com/debug/tor-botnet-microsoft-malware-remove/
[17:22:13] <lz__> seriously, what the fuck
[17:22:20] <bomb> lz__ you're in luck. Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian released new versions recently
[17:23:49] <lz__> thing is, I think it removed tor from my computer between a few months ago and now, the article talks about 2014
[17:25:21] <biberu> lz__: still doubtful, and it never happened to me, but i don't usually have it on my desktop system. maybe i should try to put it somewhere and see if it disappears ^^
[17:27:20] <bomb> lz__ Go with KDE if you want classic Windows taskbar experience; GNOME is a macOS wannabe, Xfce is buggy AF.
[17:27:44] <bomb> so you'd want either Kubuntu, Fedora KDE spin, or Debian KDE
[17:27:47] <lz__> bomb: next computer I'll build will be linux, and windows in a VM. With this one I can't because my mobo is too old for iommu
[17:28:47] <bomb> lz__ what about dual booting? I normally use Windows for music & graphics with no internet access, and Linux (Fedora) for work
[17:29:07] <lz__> I hate rebooting
[17:29:23] <bomb> fair. but it's no big deal anymore thanks to SSDs
[17:30:28] <lz__> last time I tried to back up stuff, windows deleted various things it thought were "malware" (like, old keygens for things that happened to be in some directory)
[17:30:52] <lz__> thankfully I could restore them with my backups (but not with windows's "restore" option which never works for me)
[17:31:27] <lz__> but windows removing tor is really the last straw as for my trust goes
[17:31:36] <bomb> lz__ I use a program called OOSU10 to prevent some Windows shit. maybe it can help you as well
[17:31:58] <lz__> yeah you mentioned it the other day. I'm still hesitant
[17:31:59] <bomb> yeah I use Tor every day

[19:13:20] <lz__> yeah I googled it; but I still don't have 1000~2000 bucks to put in a new machine yet
[19:13:41] <lz__> I'm working on a game project and I'm afraid it won't make much when it's released, if I ever release it
[19:13:50] <bomb> just buy an SSD. you don't have to run Linux and Windows at the same time
[19:13:54] <MichaelLong> now I would probably go for an AMD-system but then again, intel just released a new CPU generation that easily beats current AMD offerings
[19:14:40] <lz__> bomb: I don't even want to give windows access to my filesystem. so if I need to access my fs AND use windows, that wouldn't work
[19:14:55] <bomb> I find Intel CPUs more cost effective since they contain GPUs
[19:15:10] <bomb> lz__ you're overcomplicating things
[19:15:17] <BtbN> The AMD ones with GPU ar at least as cost effective.
[19:15:31] <lz__> what's complicated in what I described
[19:15:39] <lz__> I don't trust windows because it randomly deletes files it doesn't like
[19:15:55] <BtbN> That sounds like you got a virus. Windows does not randomly delete files.
[19:15:56] <bomb> BtbN which Ryzen is that?
[19:16:02] <lz__> BtbN: yes it does
[19:16:03] <BtbN> All the ones with a G in their model name
[19:16:12] <bomb> only one model
[19:16:16] <bomb> per generation
[19:16:27] <lz__> it calls it "malware" and then it removes it. Earlier today I found it deleted tor, without any notice
[19:16:40] <bomb> https://www.amd.com/en/processors/ryzen-with-graphics
[19:16:46] <bomb> hmm they added new ones
[19:17:06] <BtbN> There's at least one of every "class" each generation
[19:17:27] <BtbN> If it deleted tor, you downloaded it from a questionable source and should probably have uploaded it to virus total before use
[19:17:52] <lz__> no I didn't. I also provided links to other people claiming the same thing, and an article about microsoft doing it 6 years ago already
[19:18:12] <lz__> if it thought it was a "virus" it would have told me, rather than delete it without a trace even in the AV logs
[19:18:27] <bomb> why do you even have an AV
[19:18:38] <lz__> bomb: you can't disable it afaik
[19:18:48] <lz__> but it's not the point since it's not the AV that deleted it
[19:18:57] <lz__> anyway, I'm done with this shit

[19:20:52] <bomb> where did you download the Tor browser, by the way?
[19:21:35] <lz__> BtbN: https://www.reddit.com/r/TOR/comments/4bnt27/tor_browser_deleted_from_computer/ https://www.reddit.com/r/TOR/comments/kvxabs/tor_browser_randomly_deleted_from_pc/ https://www.reddit.com/r/TOR/comments/69buyy/windows_10_deletes_tor/  https://it.slashdot.org/story/14/01/16/2132253/microsoft-remotely-deleted-tor-from-windows-machines-to-stop-botnet
[19:21:49] <lz__> torproject.org
[19:23:01] <bomb> legit-tor-browser-downloads.info/download.php
[19:23:23] <BtbN> So there's a bunch of mad clueless people on Reddit, and a final link that clears up what's going on: "Microsoft remotely deleted old versions of Tor anonymizing software from Windows machines to prevent them from being exploited by Sefnit, a botnet that spread through the Tor network"
[19:24:00] <BtbN> They added an old and wormable version of tor to Defender. Which seems like a good move to me
[19:24:19] <MichaelLong> they care about you lz__
[19:24:24] <lz__> I think my tor version was quite up to date
[19:24:39] <lz__> and eventhough, there's no trace of it in defender's logs
[19:24:55] <BtbN> Probably done with one of their monthly anti-malware rollouts
[19:25:05] <lz__> but maybe I'm a mad clueless people too
[19:25:15] <BtbN> Well, you're definitely behaving like one
[19:25:23] <lz__> ok
[19:25:54] <MichaelLong> that's not nice :/
[19:26:27] <lz__> yeah, calling someone random names because you don't believe him, sounds like being clueless
[19:27:23] <BtbN> No idea where I called anyone names. You came up with that yourself.
[19:28:02] <BtbN> You're making quite serious claims here, and have nothing to back it up. So what other conclusion is there?
[19:29:17] <lz__> here's another one https://www.reddit.com/r/TOR/comments/mlc1xv/tor_disappeared_from_my_pc/
[19:29:29] <lz__> I wonder how many posts I need to find before you decide they're not all liars
[19:29:58] <lz__> nvm this one seems to be a false positive
[19:30:21] <BtbN> All the ones I can find are from ~2014 era, where that worm was going around
[19:30:32] <BtbN> nothing that looks in any way credible or non-user-error since then
[19:31:03] <lz__> https://www.reddit.com/r/TOR/comments/kvxabs/tor_browser_randomly_deleted_from_pc/ this one is from 9 months ago, and in the comments someone said the same thing happened 5 months ago
[19:32:00] <lz__> I agree that it could be some user error, I just happen to be one of those users and I'm usually careful with what I do with my files
[19:33:11] <BtbN> I just have serious trouble believing that if Windows just randomly deleted Tor that various news outlets wouldn't be full of that
[19:33:39] <BtbN> A botched auto-update of tor itself or something seems much more likely
[19:33:40] <lz__> I was expecting more user reports too
[19:34:01] <bomb> latest-tor-downloads.museum
[19:34:37] <bomb> accept it
[19:38:05] <lz__> anyway there's a precedent to windows removing tor specifically, + all the shit defender does, + the "storage sense" hell that removes "old unused files" (which I disabled), etc
[19:39:04] <bomb> I think your computer is just compromised because of the random keygens you download from the internet.
[19:39:29] <lz__> no, those were in old archive folders, I'd never execute them
[19:40:21] <bomb> if you never execute, why do you have them in the first place?
[19:40:44] <lz__> type "can't restore qu" in google, it autocompletes with "can't restore quarantined files windows defender" lol
[19:41:30] <lz__> bomb: they're archive stuff, I'm not going to delete random shit from it because windows doesn't like it
[19:41:56] <lz__> defender even flags things like vnc installers
[19:42:04] <lz__> it's a shit show
[19:45:00] <bomb> opensource all the way baby. no need for keygens

[21:32:05] <Suchiman> penetrarthur: using `await`?
[21:32:23] <Suchiman> penetrarthur: bubbles it up to the caller but you need to await all the way
[21:42:42] <penetrarthur> Suchiman for some reason it doesn't bubble up. I think I am doing it all wrong. I create a Thread from main thread and run an async TaskParent there. That TaskParent awaits TaskChild1 which awaits TaskChild2 in the loop. When TaskChild2 throws an exception, the try/catch in TaskParent doesn't register it.
[21:43:28] <penetrarthur> I am trying to make a TCP client by awaiting NetworkStream.ReadyAsync in a loop
[21:43:43] <penetrarthur> and reconnecting if it throws an exception inside

[22:02:05] <Suchiman> penetrarthur91: well, hard to tell if you oversimplified or if it's something else, `await networkStream.ReadAsync();` is not a line that would compile
[22:02:41] <penetrarthur91> there's buffers, indexes, lengths etc
[22:03:09] <Suchiman> for all i know, the way that sample code is written should propagate exceptions no problem
[22:09:07] <penetrarthur91> ok, i will have to find a workaround
[22:09:45] <penetrarthur91> i am doing that on unity3d on mono, so there can be bugs with that

[22:17:10] <biberu> that example looks oversimplified, but wouldn't it just shut down immediately? would that happen in the real code?

[23:15:19] <bomb> so you don't have to show them manually
[23:15:39] <ern> No.
[23:15:49] <biberu> why not?
[23:16:03] <ern> I will simply not visit those venues. I'm actually going to ask the gym for a refund / freeze my card until this is resolved.
[23:16:04] <biberu> (serious question)
[23:16:37] <ern> biberu: Have you seen these QR codes in operation?
[23:17:00] <bomb> I have
[23:17:12] <ern> Who is checking them? Are they forcing to check your ID / passport at the same time? Is the person checking the passport proficient in detecting falsified documents?
[23:17:13] <bomb> he's asking why don't you like the automatic method
[23:17:21] <biberu> i don't know what kind of system your region is using / discussing, but it's an implementation issue then?
[23:17:40] <bomb> looks like it
[23:17:42] <ern> It's just theater.
[23:18:31] <bomb> ern so you're unhappy they're not checking you out thoroughly?
[23:19:13] <ern> bomb: it's a theater. either you do it properly or not at all.
[23:19:42] <biberu> that answers one of my questions at least
[23:19:47] <ern> But in reality, it's better to just shut down everything. Close everything. Force everyone to go home.
[23:20:00] <biberu> so what would be the proper way?
[23:20:45] <ern> It would not be QR codes for entering venues
[23:21:09] <ern> Russians are masters of malicious compliance. Last 10 days has been "lockdown" here.
[23:21:12] <bomb> I thought you're worried about government surveillance and oppression ern. apparently it's just an inconvenience issue for you

[23:21:30] <ern> Stores are open, but only for pick up of "internet purchases"
[23:21:41] <ern> if you forgot to do your purchase, you can borrow an iPad...
[23:21:47] <bomb> yeah that's dumb I agree
[23:22:10] <ern> Today i was at post office and picked up a letter
[23:22:34] <ern> Seems all my favourite stores are not affected by any QR codes. Only the gym, but I have negotiated with my personal trainer to do the training outdoors instead.
[23:22:43] <biberu> ern: the qr codes is a russian thing?
[23:23:03] <ern> biberu: Seems like they are doing it in many countries now. Italy / France has riots over it.
[23:24:13] <biberu> why are they rioting over that?
[23:24:28] <bomb> they aren't rioting over technicalities of QR lol
[23:24:50] <ern> No, but "vaccine pass" that you need that to go to work etc.
[23:25:18] <biberu> but you already said you're ok with that if done properly?
[23:25:24] <ern> I'm not.
[23:25:37] <bomb> oh
[23:25:37] <biberu> so you're against the very idea?
[23:25:48] <ern> But if done properly, it might do some difference. Now it's just theater, annoyance for all.

[23:26:34] <biberu> so you are ok with passports if some ideal implementation?
[23:27:26] <ern> No.
[23:27:31] <ern> I do not like the idea.
[23:27:49] <biberu> then I'm still curious about why not, I'd like to understand
[23:27:51] <ern> However, now I double not like it because a) bad implementation b) idea itself
[23:28:40] <ern> I am not sure about the QR codes in Europe, but I think those actually contains a "signed" datastring which means they are entirely offline.
[23:28:59] <ern> the russian QR code is an URL with an UUID which points to your government file about vaccination / antibody status.
[23:29:35] <bomb> nothing's online here
[23:29:43] <ern> The European QR was "hacked" and people made codes for our friend born in 1881
[23:29:53] <bomb> all those QR codes are verified from a central server
[23:29:55] <ern> with the funny mustache
[23:30:10] <biberu> as a european, we don't have anything like that where i'm at afaik
[23:30:21] <ern> 1889 I mean
[23:30:53] <ern> And where is that?
[23:30:56] <biberu> i'm sure we can find faults with the implementations, not very interested in that though, what is your issue with the idea of a passport?
[23:31:00] <ern> I think the "EU" system is "centralized"
[23:31:14] <ern> or standardized at least
[23:31:22] <biberu> sweden
[23:31:48] <MichaelLong> ern, yeah thought so, too
[23:32:06] <ern> Then it's using the EU standard. I have not cared to try to try making a www.covidbevis.se one for myself since I'm not really citizen anymore
[23:32:22] <ern> but the QR codes I have seen are much bigger than an "url"
[23:33:23] <biberu> ern: ah, hadn't seen that
[23:33:31] <ern> seen what?
[23:34:12] <biberu> that site, i don't see any links to it from fhm though
[23:34:43] <biberu> is that official?
[23:34:45] <ern> It's https://www.ehalsomyndigheten.se/

[23:35:33] <biberu> ah
[23:36:16] <ern> So if you got vaccinated, you can pull your cert from there. Should you feel inclined to do so.
[23:37:01] <biberu> haven't needed it for anything ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[23:37:25] <biberu> wasn't even aware the service existed
[23:37:58] <ern> now you know.
[23:38:08] <biberu> knowing is good
[23:38:10] <ern> And I guess it's needed if you want to travel to norway or any other place.
[23:38:35] <biberu> i don't want to travel to norway
[23:38:40] <ern> i guess from tomorrow you can go to 'murica too
[23:38:44] <ern> if you're fully vaccinated
[23:38:50] <biberu> or murica either
[23:39:36] <ern> There are not so many places to go which I want to go to.
[23:39:50] <ern> I'd like to go to poland to visit my friends, and Portugal. But... nope.
[23:40:08] <ern> Ah, here is another thing which makes the "qr code" shit in my opinion:
[23:40:37] <ern> My vaccination with Sputnik V is not valid for travel in EU. If I was a citizen of San Marino, where population have got Sputnik V, it would be valid.
[23:40:38] <biberu> (gtg for a bit)
[23:40:56] <ern> So, basically, Coronavirus knows what citizenship you have?
