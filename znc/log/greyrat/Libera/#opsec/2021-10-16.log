[01:29:43] <Joanna> Hi
[01:29:49] <spanishsunrise> howdy
[01:30:08] <Joanna> Some of the people in that other channel are quite arrogant lol
[01:30:22] *** Joins: inky_ (~inky@46.36.117.129)
[01:31:23] <spanishsunrise> they certainly aren't open to arguments lol
[01:32:29] <spanishsunrise> thinking that snowden is a idiot that want fame hehehe
[01:33:13] <Joanna> They don’t see the connection between loans and inflation
[01:33:25] *** Quits: inky (~inky@178.78.136.212) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[01:34:35] <spanishsunrise> well thats not very difficult to see even for a person thats not an expert
[01:35:34] <spanishsunrise> I thought most people knew that after 2008
[01:36:03] <spanishsunrise> how corrupt the financial system was I mean
[01:36:36] <spanishsunrise> they seem to trust the financial system alot
[01:37:46] <Joanna> In the 1950s money was made of silver and a man could support an entire family and own a house without a mortgage
[01:39:03] <Joanna> Nobody has noticed the change to both parents working to pay off a loan on a house for 30 years
[01:41:01] <spanishsunrise> those benefiting have noticed and own the means of communicating this fact
[01:44:11] <Joanna> I think most people know someone who was alive in the 1950s . It’s insane how people can’t notice the obvious right under their noses because they are distracted with the media circus.
[01:50:46] <Hydragyrum> just took my encor 350-401 test for ccnp, hope I passed...
[01:51:59] <Joanna> What kinds of questions were in there?
[01:53:54] <Hydragyrum> largely random details about the technologies covered, a good bit of "what is the result of x config" and "which set of config directives will accomplish result foo in situation bar"
[01:53:57] <Hydragyrum> all multiple choice
[01:57:38] <Joanna> I once saw an online test given to someone applying for a job and it was about object oriented programming and it seemed like jargon from some text book. I couldn’t understand the questions and I’ve been doing object oriented programming for years. I started to feel angry that someone would be given such a test.
[01:58:27] <Hydragyrum> hell yeah I just got a "Result: Pass" on the preliminary score rep
[01:58:37] <Hydragyrum> fuckin hype
[01:59:12] <Hydragyrum> I was kinda not sure I'd pass from how some of the questions were (kinda didn't remember all the exact details of a lot of stuff)
[02:00:15] <Joanna> Congrats
