[02:18:06] <|3b|> also consider that "game devs" covers a lot of different groups who don't all agree about things. lots of game devs are perfectly happy with GC (minecraft made plenty of $ with java GC, similarly lots of mobile devs probably use GC). there just happens to be a few particular subgroups that are noisy about disliking it :)
[02:19:38] <|3b|> some for good reasons, some not 
[02:20:29] <|3b|> and then there are some other groups who want to be in those groups, so like to repeat things
[02:21:38] <technomancy> the tech industry is after all in the end just a different kind of fashion industry
[02:22:27] <|3b|> well, more "tech industry is full of people" with all the problems that entails :/
[02:22:35] <technomancy> lol true
[02:22:56] <|3b|> pretty much everything is equally "fashion industry" in that sense
[02:24:43] * |3b| wants "gradual GC" (though with inverted sense) to go with "gradual typing" 
[02:27:17] <|3b|> so i can write some small kernel of c-like lisp code that never pauses for GC along with most of the code being normal flexible lisp code, without having to actually write C (and then write a bunch of FFI,etc)
[02:28:30] <technomancy> I've wondered about prescheme for that
