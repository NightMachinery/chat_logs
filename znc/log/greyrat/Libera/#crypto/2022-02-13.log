[06:39:57] <kj7rrv> Are pgp signatures still secure when used properly?
[06:40:00] <kj7rrv> ms7821: 
[06:44:40] <ms7821> sure, but properly means checking full fingerprints, having a functional web of trust, understanding what part of the message is actually signed, etc
[06:45:14] <ms7821> pgp is one of those things that works fine as long as you're an expert, but has sharp edges otherwise
[06:45:32] <ms7821> so it depends what you're using it for
[06:49:15] <kj7rrv> Okay
[06:49:40] <kj7rrv> Would it be possible to encrypt a VoIP stream with PGP?
[06:50:04] <kj7rrv> Or could you use PGP to send the key for some other encryption system?
[06:51:31] <ms7821> use tls
[06:53:13] <ms7821> or dtls given it's voip
[06:57:43] <kj7rrv> Okay thank you
[07:00:23] <ms7821> like in theory you can, just as you can do IP over avian carriera, but it's not a good solution. tls is stream-based, and any voip system your building can be built in a compatible and well-tested way over off-the-shelf stuff like webrtc
[07:00:29] <ms7821> you're&
[07:01:31] <kj7rrv> Okay. Is there a decentralized way to issue tls certificates?
[07:03:09] <ms7821> what do you mean by decentralised? not using "the man" letsencrypt? or resilient to global well-funded malicious actors?
[07:03:43] <ms7821> you can run your or CA (though I strongly recommend against it) but that's kind of antithetical to decentralisation

[07:07:44] <TimMc> kj7rrv: If you're already using PGP, you'd want to use PGP just to transmit the encryption key for a VOIP-specific encryption protocol.

[07:12:28] <ms7821> kj7rrv, I think you missed a message from TimMc about using pgp to protect the session key, but in general your voip signalling system will have a way to inject key information that doesn't require certificates. e.g. webrtc uses the SDP messages
[07:12:32] <kj7rrv> Okay. It's for a ham radio VoIP system; basically, if you have a ham radio license, you can connect to a ham radio repeater anywhere in the world (as long as the repeater is linked to the VOIP system) and talk to people within radio range of the repeater. One of the problems with these networks is that they have to make sure only licensed ham radio operators can participate. Most (all afaik) currently use a centralized system where one person (or 
[07:12:32] <kj7rrv> group of people) validate license(s) and grant access, and I'm trying to design something with similar security, but decentralized (basically a web of trust for ham radio). Is there a feasible way to implement that?
[07:12:57] <kj7rrv> ms7821: yes I did miss that, thank you
[07:13:23] <ms7821> as a ham licensee, I'm pretty sure encrypting traffic isn't allowed
[07:13:40] <kj7rrv> No, the encrypted part is over the Internet
[07:13:44] <ms7821> (at least, in a way that couldn't be decrypted on demand)
[07:13:56] <kj7rrv> Then it gets relayed unencrypted onto ham radio frequencies
[07:14:42] <kj7rrv> Just signatures are actually enough; the goal is to make sure someone who doesn't have a ham license isn't using the VOIP system to transmit on ham frequencies
[07:15:59] <ms7821> that still sounds like you're transmitting encrypted voip on ham frequencies
[07:17:03] <kj7rrv> No, the data travels encrypted over the Internet, then it is decrypted, converter to audio, and transmitted as an unencrypted, unscrambled FM audio signal
[07:17:16] <kj7rrv> s/converter/converted
[07:17:17] <ms7821> oh I see
[07:17:37] <ms7821> so like a repeater but actually a voip gateway
[07:17:43] <kj7rrv> Yes
[07:18:00] <kj7rrv> Similar to EchoLink or IRLP, if you're familiar with those
[07:19:24] <ms7821> I feel like there needs to be a manual trust step somewhere in this
[07:19:32] <kj7rrv> The goal is a decentralized FOSS replacement for EchoLink
[07:19:53] <TimMc> It sounds like maybe you want signing rather than encryption.
[07:20:05] <kj7rrv> My thought was to have a Web of trust of ham radio operators, but including callsigns in the data that is validated
[07:20:18] <TimMc> (or some kind of authorization system that isn't even cryptographic)

[07:21:19] <kj7rrv> Yes
[07:21:38] <TimMc> The ham community is probably curmudgeonly enough to do key signing parties and whatnot. :-P
[07:22:04] *** Parts: isf (~iShareFre@fsf/member/iShareFreedom) (Leaving)
[07:22:11] <ms7821> the alternative would involve co-ordination from all the licensing authorities
[07:22:33] <ms7821> whcih I assume is what echolink does?
[07:22:34] <kj7rrv> Yeah, EchoLink requires you to send a copy of your license
[07:22:39] <ms7821> right
[07:23:28] <kj7rrv> And that's probably what would be done at a ham radio key signing party, except there wouldn't be a central verifying authority
[07:24:09] * kj7rrv just realized that he doesn't definitively know that any of the people he talks to on the radio are licensed
[07:24:41] <ms7821> yeah this is problem with cryptography, it makes stuff very binary
[07:25:27] <kj7rrv> Would it be best to have a separate ham radio WoT, or somehow use the existing WoT?
[07:25:43] <kj7rrv> How hard would it be to add call signs to PGP certificates?
[07:27:55] <TimMc> Should be very easy. There's a free-text comment field.
[07:28:50] <kj7rrv> Oh okay that would help
[07:29:06] <kj7rrv> So just add "callsign=KJ7RRV" at the start?
[07:29:33] <kj7rrv> Would that allow someone to sign the key without also signing the callsign part?
[07:31:45] <TimMc> Well, if I recall correctly, that comment field is basically there as a disambiguator, and is part of the identity of the owner.
[07:34:01] <kj7rrv> Okay. So it would probably be necessary to have a separate web of trust?
[07:34:28] <kj7rrv> I guess it wouldn't be too hard to have two keys, one for ham radio and one for other uses?
[07:35:04] <TimMc> I guess I might be reluctant to sign someone's public key if they included their callsign in their identity and I couldn't verify that...
[07:35:23] <TimMc> But if I could verify it, then it would certainly be fine to include.
[07:35:51] <xx> isn't there a provision against encrypted stuff on ham radio?

[07:38:08] <xx> hmm, that would be fine then
[07:38:14] <kj7rrv> Exactly ^^^
[07:38:20] <ms7821> yeah this is basically an abuse prevention system
[07:38:28] <TimMc> oh, here we go: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EchoLink
[07:38:34] <kj7rrv> And I think it should be okay to use signatures on ham radio frequencies?
[07:38:48] <kj7rrv> Yes, I'm trying to design a decentralized replacement for EchoLink
[07:39:28] <TimMc> I vaguely recall something about signatures being "probably OK" since they're not making anything inaccessible, but I am *not* a ham person.
[07:39:57] <kj7rrv> Okay
[07:40:14] <ms7821> I don't think there's a suggestion of transmitting anythimg cryto-ish
[07:40:17] <kj7rrv> Iirc the wording in us regulations is "encoded to hide the meaning"
[07:40:30] <ms7821> you'd auth to the gateway ~somehow~ and then just talk
[07:40:33] <kj7rrv> No, that wasn't the plan, but I think signatures would be okay anyway
[07:40:34] <xx> ask your regulator, probably the safest bet
[07:40:37] <kj7rrv> Yes that's the plan
[07:40:50] <ms7821> the only bit I'm unsure about is whether you want to rely on pgp for actually connecting to the gateway. you might want to have people use their pgp creds to sign once and treat that as lasting authentication for say their email address or username
[07:41:02] <kj7rrv> Okay, that would work
[07:41:19] <kj7rrv> Sign a TLS client certificate with a PGP key?
[07:41:39] <ms7821> sign a random value
[07:41:40] <kj7rrv> (self signed TLS certificate)
[07:41:50] <kj7rrv> Oh okay
[07:42:01] <kj7rrv> And give it to whom?
[07:42:24] <kj7rrv> The gateways will be controlled by different people, so you would do that once per gateway?
[07:42:32] <ms7821> oh I assumed the gateway would be centralised
[07:43:05] <kj7rrv> No, there would be several gateways owned by different people
[07:43:14] <TimMc> Maybe someone runs a centralized registry, but publishes copies of it periodically?

[07:43:30] <TimMc> lol
[07:43:31] <ms7821> pribably reasonable though, people are unlikely to have pgp on whatever they use preferentially for voip
[07:43:33] <kj7rrv> That's pretty much how EchoLink works
[07:43:54] <kj7rrv> (Centralized registry, not Blockchain)
[07:44:23] <xx> just stuff the word 'blockchain' somewhere and someone will invest
[07:44:46] <xx> you don't even need to know anything about blockchains, because neither will the investor

[07:46:27] <kj7rrv> ^^^ that's the part that prohibits encryption
[07:46:44] <kj7rrv> I don't think a signature would be prohibited by that
[07:47:08] <xx> in pgp, a signature is encryption using the private key
[07:47:12] <ms7821> yeah my understanding is signatures and checksums are totally fine
[07:47:22] <ms7821> as is encrypting if you include the key
[07:47:45] <kj7rrv> So there is no way to PGP sign something without also encrypting it,m
[07:47:47] <kj7rrv> *?
[07:48:19] <xx> no, I'm saying what "signing" actually means on the technical level
[07:48:21] <kj7rrv> How do Linux distro package signatures work?
[07:48:23] <TimMc> Centralized registry; people send in evidence of license, receive back a keypair. Public key/callsign pairs get published on a website and are available via API.  Your EchoLink replacement software uses the private key to prove identity to the stream recipient during the stream handshakes one way or another. Sound about right?
[07:48:24] <kj7rrv> Oh okay
[07:48:51] <xx> in PGP, signing means encrypting using private key, encrypting means encrypting using public key
[07:48:51] <kj7rrv> Yes, except the goal is to avoid a centralized registry
[07:49:00] <kj7rrv> Oh okay
[07:49:13] <kj7rrv> But a signature doesn't hide the meaning of anything, right?
[07:49:41] <xx> a cleartext signature won't, except for the base64 (or whatever other format you choose) bit that's the signature
[07:49:44] <xx> and that might be a problem
[07:49:49] <kj7rrv> Oh okay
[07:49:57] <xx> ask your regulator, but perhaps a lawyer first
[07:50:10] <xx> because if I were a regulator, and receive a poorly worded question, I'd likely deny it
[07:50:32] <xx> ham is given a lot of leeway only because everything about it is so open
[07:51:22] <ms7821> I'd still say you want to perform a pgp signature step to authorise access to each separately owned gateway (or stand up a centralised auth server to make it easier). but maybe that's a v1.1 thing
[07:52:03] <ms7821> because sip phones can do auth but won't have your pgp keys on them
[07:52:03] <xx> I'd even say avoid pgp because it's a mess and use something like what openbsd-signify uses
[07:52:50] <kj7rrv> It's more likely that people will be using programs in computers than sip phones
[07:52:57] <ms7821> ahh ok
[07:53:03] <kj7rrv> So sip phone compatibility isn't an issue
[07:53:24] <kj7rrv> It would be nice but not a must-have
[07:55:02] <kj7rrv> I'm not sure how club call signs would work; I guess the trustee would have the key?
[07:57:11] <TimMc> kj7rrv: Here's an example of a PGP signature: http://sprunge.us/Lm3dDY
[07:57:20] <TimMc> I signed one sentence from example.com. :-P
[07:58:00] <kj7rrv> "the connection was interrupted"
[07:58:14] <TimMc> hmm
[07:58:48] <kj7rrv> Sorry gtg bb in about 15 minutes
[07:58:50] <ms7821> for clubs, you could recommend they use subkeys
[07:59:28] <TimMc> kj7rrv: https://paste.debian.net/plain/1230708
[07:59:55] <TimMc> You can see that there's a brief header, the message, and then a signature block (which is fixed-size).
[08:00:07] <TimMc> The signature is actually over a hash of the message.
[08:00:28] <TimMc> So you can see the message "This domain is for use in illustrative examples in documents." is in plain view, there. No encryption.
[08:00:48] <xx> the problem is that anyone can just replace the base64 part there with an actual encrypted message, and afterwards claim user error
[08:01:03] <xx> as a regulator, I wouldn't like it
[08:01:57] <kj7rrv> Oh okay
[08:02:27] <xx> but maybe I'm just too strict, I've had to jump through too many gov hoops in my life for all sorts of stuff
[08:03:56] <TimMc> xx: Luckily, the proposed system would never actually involve broadcasting signatures over the air.

[08:04:18] <TimMc> unless that VOIP link happens to go over a WISP on the last-mile, I suppose :-)
[08:05:31] <ms7821> the club scenario is probably going to set a bunch of contraints actually. you need it to authorise multiple people for a limited period without being onerous, and individuals may have access to multiple club callsigns. you also might want to allow one-off access, but keep central control
[08:05:49] <ms7821> so yeah short-lived subkeys are probably the answer
[08:06:33] <ms7821> I can't believe I'm recommending pgp stuff in #crypto
[08:07:04] <xx> ms7821: I can't believe you're doing that either
[08:08:19] <ms7821> 😬

[08:22:39] <kj7rrv> Would it be feasible to implement a web of trust with a different encryption system?
[08:25:46] <kj7rrv> Re: club calls, it would probably be okay to do what EchoLink does and limit club calls to running radio-VoIP links, rather than user software; that would eliminate the need for multiple users
[08:28:40] <ms7821> well another nice thing about subkeys is nobody can stop them doing it, so it's always there as an option
[08:32:01] <kj7rrv> Okay, so anyone who trusts the main key will trust a subkey, right?
[08:33:25] <ms7821> they kind of have to, because subkeys are what you use for signing generally
[08:33:42] *** Joins: cvmn (~caveman@gateway/tor-sasl/caveman)
[08:34:12] <kj7rrv> Oh okay
[08:34:20] <kj7rrv> Can there be a subkey of a subkey?
[08:34:46] <ms7821> I suspect so
[08:34:52] <kj7rrv> Okay
[08:35:19] <ms7821> but I'm not sure if it'd be supported by any tooling
[08:36:06] <kj7rrv> Oh okay
[08:36:52] <kj7rrv> I guess the protocol could just handle club calls the same way it handles personal calls, and leave management up to the club?
[08:37:15] <kj7rrv> Can a key be "owned" by a group?
[08:38:00] <ms7821> oh, I just checked and subkeys aren't actually hierarchical in implementation. the oldest is just defined to be the main key
[08:38:36] <ms7821> so sub-subkeys wouldn't exist
[08:40:27] <kj7rrv> Okay
[08:41:03] <ms7821> as for groups, I think you'd solve that by having a separate identity for the group and sharing the keys. there isn't afaik any sort of delegation in pgp
[08:41:57] <kj7rrv> Okay
[08:42:52] <ms7821> you could add that in the gateway, but would you also want to allow for casual use by people without their own callsigns? maybe not
[08:45:21] <kj7rrv> Yeah probably not
[08:45:43] <kj7rrv> Club calls should probably only be able to run RF links, similar to EchoLink "sysop mode"
