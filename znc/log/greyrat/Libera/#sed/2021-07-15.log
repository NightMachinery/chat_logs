[04:13:48] <madprops> I'm trying to do a range delete
[04:14:00] <madprops> sed "/222/,/333/d" file
[04:14:19] <madprops> but it only prints 111

[05:40:22] <madprops> e36freak, oops I see it is printing 444 at the end
[05:40:27] <madprops> there was no linebreak
[05:40:32] <madprops> so I thought it was part of the prompt

[14:29:12] <stevenm> is there a way I can feed sed a file... and the goal isn't to modify it, but rather just to check the contents of the last line?  i.e. if the last time equals what it should... then print the whole of what it receive.  But if it doesn't... print nothing.
[14:32:13] <Riviera> stevenm: sed '1h;1!H;$!d;/^expected line$/!d;g' file
[14:32:51] <izabera> sexy
[14:33:18] <stevenm> indeed it is
[14:34:07] <stevenm> thanks Riviera... maybe i'll eventually work out how it does that :P
[14:34:47] <Riviera> do you know some programming language? use that instead, or learn one, instead of wasting time with sed. :)
