[00:47:13] <shiza> Actually here is halfway there... from the early prices a decade ago.
[00:48:08] <as2333> it's just a matter of adding 1 billion to the price, or the dollar reaching its real value of 0.

[04:06:43] <belcher> nah, it just means the calculation "market cap" is BS :p
[04:06:48] <palladidrago> agreed
[04:07:02] <palladidrago> What better way is there to calculate the value of an asset tho?
[04:07:08] <palladidrago> like that is the best metric we have
[04:07:12] <palladidrago> except for total locked value

[04:07:30] <belcher> some things we're not meant to know
[04:07:46] <belcher> market cap != "total locked value" lol
[04:07:53] <palladidrago> i never said that bro
[04:08:00] <palladidrago> i said that it might be a better metric than market cap
[04:08:11] <palladidrago> market cap is supply * price

[04:08:24] <belcher> why dont we do this, i create a shitcoin with a trillion units, and sell one to as2333 for $1, now we have a shitcoin worth $1tln
[04:08:51] <as2333> belcher, there's nothing wrong with mentioning the supply of any 'coin' in dollars.
[04:08:52] <palladidrago> of course there needs to be liquidity
[04:09:06] <Henry151> if you factor in the depth, that would be a more accurate way to measure.. i.e. instead of counting all the coins at the last price they were sold at, count only the ones that are available for sale, and count them at the prices they're advertised at
[04:09:27] <palladidrago> yes smart
[04:09:29] <belcher> Henry151 some coins available for sale are pretty hard to measure, for example coins on the p2p markets
[04:09:33] <as2333> belcher, 'market' price of dogshitcoin is X. Multiply that price times number of  coins and you get the supply denominated in dollars.
[04:09:37] <Henry151> true
[04:09:43] <palladidrago> most coins arent sold on p2p markets tho
[04:09:45] <belcher> also how do you take into account things like merchants and customers
[04:09:49] <belcher> i.e. people using bitcoin as money
[04:09:56] <palladidrago> it's harder for bitcoin
[04:10:04] <palladidrago> there are less people taking shiba as money
[04:10:07] <belcher> you'll just have to accept the fact that some things you cant measure in practice
[04:10:24] <belcher> and if you try you leave yourself open to manipulation, like in my $1tln shitcoin example
[04:10:25] <palladidrago> you is me?
[04:10:32] <belcher> anyone
[04:10:38] <palladidrago> ok
[04:10:46] <as2333> belcher, if you don't 'like' that number too bad. But you have to claim that either the price or the number of coins are not valid pieces of data (which of course they are)
[04:10:59] <Henry151> i think of it like this -- if you could execute a single "market sell order" that would fill all the open orders sitting on the books at all the markets all at once, however much money that would be, that's about the total value of the asset
[04:11:28] <Henry151> i mean market buy
[04:11:31] <as2333> last but not least, financial 'markets' are shit and that's why they value something like dogshitcoin the way they do. There's nothing hypocrtical about pointing this out,
[04:11:34] <Henry151> whatever you probably get the idea
[04:12:39] <palladidrago> do you think the market does not correctly value bitcoin
[04:12:43] <as2333> belcher, your example only proves that a price can be unreliable. The simple calculation supply times price is still valid.
[04:12:48] <Henry151> of course that measure would also be flawed because for example, what if someone has a limit order to sell 10 bitcoins for $999,990 each, that would unfairly inflate the result
[04:13:20] <Henry151> as2333: the problem with supply times price is, the price you're using doesn't apply to the entire supply
[04:13:24] <palladidrago> i don't understand exactly what calculation you would be making
[04:13:38] <palladidrago> do you just want to buy all the liquidity?
[04:13:39] <belcher> as2333 the point of my $1tln shitcoin example is that "supply" can be easily manipulated too, because that shitcoin had a trillion units but only one being sold
[04:13:52] <palladidrago> yes
[04:14:01] <palladidrago> but only a portion of the supply is ever available
[04:14:03] <belcher> then you've got the issue that some shitcoins like eth dont actually have a publicly known value of their supply
[04:14:18] <belcher> its not like in bitcoin where anyone can run `gettxoutsetinfo` to get the full supply trustlessly calculated
[04:14:25] <palladidrago> since you have to put up collateral on uniswap, you need to have the equivalent (1tn dollars) in eth or some other "real" asset
[04:14:43] <belcher> eth full nodes are impossible to run, and they seem to give different results when querying the full supply
[04:14:53] <palladidrago> you can query totalSupply but it's easy to manipulate that
[04:14:58] <palladidrago> as you can just put in whatever number you want
[04:15:11] <palladidrago> what do you mean
[04:15:15] <palladidrago> i think they always give the same amount
[04:15:18] <palladidrago> why should it be different
[04:15:25] <palladidrago> it's a public parameter in the smart contract
[04:16:40] <as2333> belcher, well I assumed that supply is known/audited cryptographically bla bla. I don't know if that's the actual case for something like eth. and I wasn't defending them anyway. Just commenting on the general idea.
[04:16:54] <belcher> nope, its impossible to audit the supply of eth trustlessly
[04:17:08] <as2333> ok - not surprising =P
[04:17:10] <palladidrago> ooh i thought you meant the supply of erc20 tokens, sorry
[04:17:24] <belcher> running an eth full node is incredibly difficult, and it seems to be if you manage to do so then they all give a slightly different value for the total supply
[04:17:29] <palladidrago> belcher: what do you mean by "they are impossible to run" ?
[04:17:47] <belcher> palladidrago they require huge amounts of ram and other resources, and they constantly crash
[04:17:57] <palladidrago> got it
[04:18:00] <belcher> basically everyone is instructed to run them in "fast sync" mode which just means they skip all the checks
[04:18:12] <belcher> for all we know the eth devs could be printing infinite eth and awarding it to themselves
[04:18:13] <palladidrago> they don't check the transaction history?
[04:18:18] <belcher> correct
[04:18:28] <palladidrago> Are you sure the devs have an eth printer?????
[04:18:41] <palladidrago> do you have a source on that because it's so weird to me i would like to read more
[04:18:41] <plank> with the sharding implementation they want to move to, you can forget about trustless verification
[04:19:18] <belcher> palladidrago well, we have to trust that they dont

[04:19:39] <belcher> theres some stuff here https://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumScam/
[04:19:53] <belcher> also the bitmexresearch blog wrote one or two blog posts about this
[04:20:02] <belcher> since they tried to sync an eth node from scratch but couldnt
[04:20:13] <palladidrago> i read a bunch of that, it talks about a premine, but not money printer
[04:20:44] <palladidrago> Sorry for my ignorance, but i thought ether was awarded from mining.
[04:21:06] <belcher> if nobody enforces the rules then anything can happen
[04:21:29] <palladidrago> if the devs decide to make that reward infinite with eth 2.0, it's up to the users to decide if they want to keep using that client. If they don't, the change won't get applied.
[04:21:51] <palladidrago> They don't have to be enforced tho? They are written in the code right? just like btc
[04:22:18] <belcher> that only works if the users can actually use the code
[04:22:24] <belcher> nobody in ethereum uses an ethereum full node
[04:22:27] <belcher> thats my point
[04:22:45] <palladidrago> oooooh
[04:23:19] <palladidrago> well there aren't that many bitcoin full nodes either compared to the wallets
[04:23:42] <palladidrago> maybe the ratio in bitcoin is bigger, but it still suffers from the same problem
[04:24:04] <belcher> basically anyone who wants to can run a bitcoin full node
[04:24:07] <palladidrago> ultimately the direction the protocol goes actually depends on the people that sacrifice their hardware to run a full node
[04:24:14] <belcher> using blockstream satellite you can do it with barely requiring any bandwidth
[04:24:18] <belcher> the blocks are beamed down from space
[04:24:18] <palladidrago> I've been trying to download the blockchain for 3 days now
[04:24:22] <palladidrago> it's at 70%
[04:24:27] <palladidrago> i had to use an external hard drive
[04:24:37] <palladidrago> lmfao the blockstream satellite
[04:24:55] <palladidrago> I don't like blockstream they're shady
[04:25:13] <palladidrago> I've seen some memes about em
[04:25:17] <belcher> you dont trust them at all, your full node still verifies everything same as any other full node
[04:25:34] <belcher> and it can get block hashes from other nodes via tcp to avoid blockstream eclipsing you
[04:26:18] <belcher> shitcoiners hate blockstream because some of their products are things that no shitcoin has, like that network of satellites, or lightning network (which to be clear is worked on by many other groups as well as blockstream)
[04:26:28] <palladidrago> Wait are you for real can you actually download the blockchain from blockstream
[04:26:36] <belcher> from space yes
[04:26:39] <palladidrago> wtf

[04:37:54] <nanotube> BUSY: a watchtower can only watch out for you if you negotiate with it and provide it with the 'punishment' transactions they can broadcast if they detect cheating. so not all watchtowers automatically watch for everyone, only the ones you specifically establish a relationship with. afaik.

[04:51:16] <nanotube> yes your coins are not at risk unless there's a historical channel balance that gives the other guy more coins than the current balance. (in which case he could try to broadcast the old channel state to claim it)

[04:52:16] <nanotube> mostly what i've seen is that people /accidentally/ broadcast old channel states when they lose ln node backups, and then the other node punishes them by taking the money... i haven't really seen reports of deliberate attempts at cheating
[04:52:47] <nanotube> right, routing affects the balances in your channels
[04:53:11] <BUSY> ok that makes way more sense hahaha
[04:53:30] <nanotube> i think the timelock is something like two weeks, so as long as your node is online at least once every 2 weeks, you will catch any potential cheating attempts yourself

[05:25:19] <palladidrago> so you just need to have a node with the latest 2 weeks?

[05:25:45] <palladidrago> ?
[05:25:53] <palladidrago> that counts as a full node too?

[05:26:38] <BUSY> so better to have a watchtower in advance
[05:27:09] <palladidrago> At minimum, a full node must download every transaction that has ever taken place, all new transactions, and all block headers. Additionally, full nodes must store information about every unspent transaction output until it is spent. By default full nodes are inefficient in that they download each new transaction at least twice, and they store the entire block chain (more than 165 GB as of 20180214)
[05:27:15] <palladidrago> forever, even though only the unspent transaction outputs (<2 GB) are required. Performance can improved by enabling -blocksonly mode and enabling pruning

[06:24:41] <as2333> you use silver for that
[06:24:50] <as2333> because gold 'stores' too much value
[06:24:58] <palladidrago> uh uh
[06:25:00] <as2333> (which makes it pretty easy to carry)
[06:25:20] <as2333> this is all very basic concepts of political economy by the way
[06:25:40] <palladidrago> i haven't studied political economy in high school my dear
[06:25:52] <as2333> of course not =)
[06:25:58] <palladidrago> so if you had a choice would you rather make silver legal tender or bitcoin legal tender
[06:26:10] <as2333> high school is there to indoctrinate people not to teach them anything useful
[06:26:12] <palladidrago> or would you make the dollar backed by silver/gold/btc
[06:26:22] <palladidrago> i learnt pretty useful stuff in like math class
[06:26:29] <palladidrago> i'd say math was p useful
[06:26:33] <palladidrago> also compsci
[06:26:37] <palladidrago> that was really useful
[06:26:49] <as2333> anyway I'm a libertarian. I wouldn't make anything 'legal tender'
[06:27:00] <palladidrago> i see
[06:27:09] <palladidrago> would you rather pay for coffee in silver or bitcoin
[06:27:14] <as2333> silver
[06:28:16] <palladidrago> ERGO
[06:28:19] <palladidrago> silver > bitcoin
[06:28:23] <palladidrago> :D
[06:28:30] <as2333> so anyway, I think your question about fees highlights the fact that 'scaling' this system isn't easy or solved at all.
[06:28:35] <as2333> yes I think so.
[06:29:36] <as2333> on the other hand, bitcoin is obv better than govt money if it manages to stop inflationary theft.
[06:31:54] <BUSY> and the idea being that you amortize your one-time $100 fee to use the lightning network over a long time and many transactions
[06:32:01] <BUSY> or you can just get in now today for nearly free!
[06:32:40] <BUSY> well i guess wait for the difficulty epoch, but then
[06:32:59] <palladidrago> true, but if you want bitcoin to grow (and price to go up) you need more adoption, we can't know how high tx fees can get
[06:33:07] <palladidrago> imagine 1000 usd
[06:33:22] <palladidrago> that  is not too far out of the relm of possibility
[06:33:30] <palladidrago> i could see that happening in 10 -20 years
[06:33:52] <palladidrago> wym difficulty epoch
[06:34:09] <BUSY> the hash reset after the great unplugging of china
[06:34:12] <palladidrago> yes
[06:34:16] <palladidrago> what's gonna happen
[06:34:20] <palladidrago> difficulty gonna go down
[06:34:24] <palladidrago> more people mining
[06:34:26] <BUSY> blocks will solve faster and transactions will clear faster
[06:34:39] <palladidrago> ooh
[06:34:43] <palladidrago> right
[06:34:46] <palladidrago> relative to now
[06:34:54] <palladidrago> not relative to b4 the great unplugging
[06:35:00] <palladidrago> it should stay the same
[06:35:06] <palladidrago> one heartbeat every 10 mins
[06:35:23] <BUSY> right, just not a good time to open the channel right now because we're behind schedule on blocks
[06:35:55] <as2333> >you amortize your one-time $100 fee over a long time
[06:35:57] <as2333> could be
[06:36:35] <BUSY> technically it's all dependent on demand, but ceteris paribus
[06:36:45] <as2333> yeah
[06:37:14] <palladidrago> so when difficulty go down u think line gonna go up or down
[06:38:25] <BUSY> line? NgU?
[06:40:46] <palladidrago> price i mean
[06:41:07] <palladidrago> ngu?
[06:41:25] <BUSY> i would guess that fees go down but i'm not sure what the shift to non-chinese miners will do to pricing
[06:55:31] <as2333> palladidrago, as a side note, here the word for money is the same word used for silver. Obv because silver was literally money.

[10:50:34] <guido> Hello. Regarding custom signets, I'm missing how it works: I have created a challenge, but even without importing the related private key into a bitcoincore wallet, I'm able to generate blocks with `generatetoaddress`. I though that to create blocks on a custom signet the corresponding key of the challenge must be imported into the wallet first.
