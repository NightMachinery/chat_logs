[00:00:33] <bpmedley> Understood.  That's unfortunate.  I wonder if browsers on the Linux phones like PinePhone support wasm 1.0 and the newer proposals.
[00:04:29] <MatthiasVance> O wow what
[00:04:37] <MatthiasVance> The EU will require a salary range for ALL job postings? :D
[00:05:04] <bomb> range?
[00:05:20] <MatthiasVance> "A ban on secondary activities will soon no longer be allowed."
[00:05:30] <bomb> "maximum wage" is a dumb idea :\
[00:05:31] <MatthiasVance> bomb: Yes?
[00:05:56] <MatthiasVance> Sometimes the salary range for a position is not shown
[00:06:32] <irwiss> MatthiasVance: $1/yr - $150k/yr
[00:06:47] <MatthiasVance> Nobody will respond to such a position right
[00:07:20] <Xenoprimate> I'm guessing they will have rules about percentage difference between lower and upper bound
[00:07:23] <Xenoprimate> Seems good to me
[00:08:41] <MatthiasVance> When I was looking for a new job 1+ year ago I got in touch with a lot of people, such a time waste when 80% of them are out of the range you're looking for
[00:08:52] <MatthiasVance> So I think it will help all parties involved to not waste so much time
[00:09:06] <bomb> OH, the range is for the job listings
[00:09:10] <MatthiasVance> yes
[00:09:33] <MatthiasVance> Then again any company that doesn't disclose the ranges .. has a flag anyway? :P
[00:12:31] <bomb> tell me your salary
[00:14:03] <MatthiasVance> bomb: It's not in my best interest to share it is what you're expecting?
[00:14:13] <MatthiasVance> Which is my exact point about the companies :D
[00:14:21] <bpmedley> We are paid in JavaScript widgets..
[00:14:34] <MatthiasVance> WIDGETS?? We're still on gizmos
[00:15:01] <bpmedley> need MOAR gizmos

[00:25:46] <MatthiasVance> thanks
[00:26:18] <bomb> (he went to watch pr0n)
[00:26:26] <MatthiasVance> One last question for ki9a: What about UI components like calendar etc, ever needed those in Svelte? Are things like that easy to come by?
[00:26:58] <bomb> probably svelte-calendar from npm with its 780 dependencies
[00:27:12] <MatthiasVance> xD
[00:27:46] <bomb> for Vue, there is this one: https://primefaces.org/primevue/
[00:27:47] <MatthiasVance> bomb: I went to look .. 2 dependencies
[00:28:17] <MatthiasVance> Sorry, I should say .. 2 *direct* dependencies
[00:28:22] <bomb> now look that 2 dependencies
[00:28:23] <bomb> yeah XD
[00:28:37] <ki9a> MatthiasVance: good question. I mean it works with any regular javascript lib ofc
[00:28:56] <ki9a> also this https://github.com/6eDesign/svelte-calendar is an option
[00:28:58] <MatthiasVance> Yeah but for something like React you can just "drop in" those things. Not sure if you should.. but you could.. :P
[00:29:57] <bomb> I just miss the days where you'd copy/paste jquery snippet and call it a day
[00:29:57] <MatthiasVance> Oh I thought it came with UI components
[00:30:04] <ki9a> svelte does not have any ui
[00:30:14] <ki9a> nor does tailwind
[00:30:16] <ki9a> it's all css
[00:30:33] <MatthiasVance> Svelte provides the interactivity though
[00:30:46] <MatthiasVance> So if you want to create an UI component you need something there
[00:31:08] <bomb> "svelte" sounds lisping
[00:31:27] <MatthiasVance> Sounds nordic to me
[00:31:46] <MatthiasVance> what
[00:31:50] <MatthiasVance> it's an english word??
[00:32:12] <MatthiasVance> Definitions of svelte Adjective 1 (of a person) slender and elegant.

[00:35:03] *** Joins: AbleBacon (~AbleBacon@user/AbleBacon)
[00:39:13] <ki9a> MatthiasVance: Right so it's a lot like vue/react in this regard
[00:39:15] <ki9a> no gui per se
[00:39:42] <MatthiasVance> Yeah I was under the wrong impression that React came with a UI component library
[00:39:50] <MatthiasVance> I'll dive into this tomorrow
[00:39:56] <ki9a> Svelte has no virtual dom either
[00:40:07] <ki9a> it directly updates the dom
[00:40:26] <MatthiasVance> It just means that when you pick a technology like that you might not be able to buy off-the-shelf UI components if you need them
[00:40:34] <MatthiasVance> (not saying I do, but it's something I have to figure out if I need it)
[00:41:22] <ki9a> well there's tailwindui support
[00:41:25] <ki9a> -ui
[00:41:27] <ki9a> and bulma
[00:41:35] <ki9a> and probably bootstrap if you really wnated to
[00:41:43] <ki9a> It just works
[00:42:14] <MatthiasVance> Oh that's cool
[00:42:37] <MatthiasVance> Anyway, really time for some z's, good night!
[00:45:37] <ki9a> good night.

[13:20:10] <interop_madness> MatthiasVance, DateTime.Date?
[13:20:22] <MatthiasVance> That returns a DateTime, not a DateOnly
[13:20:41] <interop_madness> The rest is merely formatting
[13:20:44] <MatthiasVance> No
[13:20:47] <MatthiasVance> It's a different type
[13:21:26] <interop_madness> But you can ignore the time component of the DateTime
[13:21:40] <interop_madness> Shouldn't make much of a difference
[13:21:59] <MatthiasVance> interop_madness: It does .. DateOnly is a different type
[13:22:13] <MatthiasVance> You can't just "ignore the time component" to suddenly get a DateOnly :P
[13:22:27] <MatthiasVance> You have to construct one from a DateTime
[13:22:48] <MatthiasVance> interop_madness: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.dateonly.fromdatetime?view=net-6.0
[13:23:14] <interop_madness> MatthiasVance, I take it you have to forward that DateOnly to an API accepting only DateOnly?
[13:23:30] <MatthiasVance> It's my own code, but yes :)
[13:23:56] <interop_madness> Overload it with DateTime parameter
[13:24:37] <interop_madness> Of course, then there might be timezone issues that would need to be addressed
[13:25:20] <MagnusRM2> i am used to the old .net framework. Now when I work with .net core adding references seems to be different and there is something called dependencies, under which you find packages.
[13:25:22] <MagnusRM2> Anyone knows some good site that explains the differences?
[13:25:59] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  Hmm i would assume there was a ToDateOnly
[13:26:20] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Indeed!
[13:26:29] <Nasp> I wish we used DateOnly in our codebase
[13:26:43] <Nasp> But because nobody trusts DateTime we use strings in certain places
[13:26:49] <Nasp> And then to DateTime.Parse
[13:26:52] <MatthiasVance> fun
[13:26:58] <MatthiasVance> If you are using SQL Server, do you use DateTime2?
[13:27:12] <Nasp> Someplaces
[13:27:24] <Nasp> Most are probably not
[13:27:42] <MatthiasVance> I can't remember why you'd want a datetime2 again but only remember you might ALWAYS want it
[13:28:10] <Nasp> It's more preicse
[13:28:24] <Nasp> DateTime in sql server is only precise to 300ms or something like that
[13:28:28] <Nasp> It's quite strange as i remember
[13:29:03] <MatthiasVance> Yeah but I am pretty sure it wasn't that
[13:29:07] <MatthiasVance> (for our use case at the time)
[13:29:10] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  It's one of those things that just takes a long time to fix
[13:29:16] <MatthiasVance> Also, why doesn't DateOnly have addition/subtraction operators!!
[13:29:17] <Nasp> And when people add more and dont use DateTime2 it takes even more
[13:29:22] <Nasp> It doesnt?
[13:29:23] <MatthiasVance> yeah :(
[13:29:25] <MatthiasVance> No !
[13:29:26] <Nasp> Maybe it was rushed
[13:29:33] <Nasp> No .AddDays?
[13:29:42] <Nasp> Or do you mean + 2
[13:29:54] <Nasp> Can't you attleast add two DateOnly?
[13:30:23] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.dateonly.adddays?view=net-6.0
[13:30:24] <Nasp> You sure?
[13:30:41] <MatthiasVance> That's not an operator
[13:30:53] <MatthiasVance> Also the reason is probably because we have no DateSpan type xD

[14:24:00] <jmer> MootPoot: Using a car analogy; interface is kinda like a steering wheel and the abstract class is like.. a part in a kit car that gives you a part that is more or less useless until you do something with it yourself...

[14:31:43] <canton7> MootPoot, practically, abstract classes can hold data, but interfaces cannot. Traditionally abstract classes could have method bodies whereas interfaces couldn't, but that's not strictly true any more with DIM
[14:32:46] <canton7> MootPoot, It's more a technical split: multiple inheritance is useful, but gets complicated when you start inheriting state and method implementations from multiple places. So the split is a compromise: you can inherit from one thing which has state and method implementations, and from mutliple things which don't have state or method
[14:32:46] <canton7> implementations
