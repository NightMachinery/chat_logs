[13:10:04] <Altreus> I'm not convinced I know myself
[13:10:14] <Altreus> I think "prove" counts, but maybe also so do things like Test::MockModule?
[13:10:24] <vague> I'd imagine it's all the tests combined that assure the application works
[13:10:49] <Altreus> ah, in my mind it was all the code that means you can test something without wrecking other stuff

[13:16:13] <Altreus> If it needs to talk to the live database it's already broken :)

[15:47:04] <LeoNerd> I can think of about 15 ways
[15:47:19] <Botje> why the assignment to $_?
[15:47:22] <LeoNerd> You're 'shift'ing so obviously you're in a sub. First idea: use a signature;   sub f($k) { my @keys = @$k; ... }

[15:47:42] *** Joins: mattil (~mattil@helsinki.portalify.com)
[15:47:58] <LeoNerd> signatures need 5.26+ but at that point you have postfix deref; so you can also write it   sub f($k) { my @keys = $k->@*; ... }   if you'd prefer
[15:48:07] <ilmari> Botje: defating @{shift} being interpreted as @shift
[15:48:07] <LeoNerd> I've been trying to get into the habit of more postfix-deref lately
[15:48:17] <ilmari> but that's better written as @{+shift} or @{shift()}
[15:48:18] <LeoNerd> @{+shift} or @{shift()}  also achieve that
[15:48:24] <ilmari> LeoNerd: ⁵
[15:48:27] <LeoNerd> or   my $k = shift;  my @keys = @$l
[15:48:28] <LeoNerd> l

[15:48:41] <LeoNerd> Or  my ($k) = @_;  my @keys = @$k;

[18:46:21] <khosruw> Altreus: yeah, because I don't know how to write it
[18:46:44] <khosruw> Actually, I wrote it but it falls into a hole
[18:47:00] <khosruw> let me give the code to understand what I mean
[18:47:34] <Altreus> you should use Moose; has routes => ( is => 'rw', default => sub { [] } );
[18:47:49] <Altreus> Then you would have my $r = Router->new; and call methods on $r
[18:48:12] <Altreus> Then, $self has a routes() and you can push onto $self->routes->@* instead of @routes
