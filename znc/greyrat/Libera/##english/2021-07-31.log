[00:07:04] <LjL> bin, decent point, that does sound better to me as well, but the question remains, why not "a dubious and bold claim" (which sounds off to me)? actually i've thought about this before but probably never mentioned it, that the same phenomenon as adjective order where the "rule" sometimes escapes me even though it's apparently that i or others have a intuitive feeling about it also applies in cases where "and" or similar is involved
[00:08:33] <bin> adjectives are almost always in the opinion-size-age-shape-colour-origin-material-purpose order
[00:08:37] <bin> so, bold is the opinion
[00:08:42] *** Quits: thojanssens (~thojansse@ptr-178-51-170-194.dyn.mobistar.be) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[00:08:43] <bin> dubious would be the origin
[00:08:47] <bin> i think
[00:08:57] <LjL> hmm
[00:09:05] <bin> maybe not the origin, really
[00:09:21] <bin> I guess they're really both opinions
[00:09:36] <LjL> is it possible that with "and", there is a tendency to put the shorter adjective first?
[00:09:57] <bin> I was just thinking that
[00:10:04] <bin> and trying to come up with an argument against it
[00:10:20] <bin> "She was brilliant and calm"
[00:10:22] <bin> sounds fine
[00:10:28] <LjL> agreed
[00:10:51] <LjL> stress on the first syllable just like "dubious", too
[00:11:03] <bin> yeah
[00:11:11] <bin> "She was beautiful and smart"
[00:11:15] <bin> sounds fine
[00:11:19] <LjL> i think maybe i've asked this or a similar question once before, and i was told it's just about which collocation happened to become more common
[00:11:28] <bin> it very well could be, tbh
[00:11:47] <LjL> but i'm not convinced, there are... countless combinations of adjectives (and with "and" we could bring up nouns too), and they can't all possibly have a well-known collocation
[00:11:53] <bin> but idk there's something about that particular one that's bothering me and I'm not sure hy
[00:11:56] <bin> why*
[00:15:40] <Samian> bin redundant it was
[00:16:03] <Samian> bin  actually no it was not redundant
[00:16:27] <Samian> it's possible to be an *un*linguistic enthusiast of language
[00:16:59] <bin> Samian: it was redundant because linguists are language enthusiasts.
[00:17:05] <Samian> meaning, it's possible to suck at what you enjoy 
[00:17:20] <Samian> I said linguistic
[00:17:27] <Samian> not linguist
[00:18:03] <Samian> argh I dont know which position is right
[00:18:26] <bin> Samian: there's absolutely no point in saying "linguistic enthusiasts of language" unless you don't know what linguistic means.
[00:18:45] <LjL> i agree with that one
[00:18:47] <bin> "hello language enthusiasts of language!" -- Samian 
[00:18:52] <LjL> 18<28bin18> Samian: it was redundant because linguists are language enthusiasts. ‚Üê but i disagree with this
[00:19:10] <LjL> i can be a programmer who hates programming because he found out too late that while he thought he liked programming, he'd actually rather do something else
[00:19:19] <LjL> i bet the same can happen with a career in linguistics
[00:19:20] <Samian> yes yes many linguists do not like their job after many years of practicing it
[00:19:45] <Samian> they were once lovers of language who have turned into broken adults to lazy to make a career hange
[00:19:55] <bin> LjL: sure, but most people don't go into a job because they hate it, so they were at least enthusiasts at one point or another. That's kind of splitting hairs but a reasonable point

[01:14:30] <grieoippe> thanks ciphrCat 
[01:15:24] <ciphrCat> but, since we are in ##English, I should correct the top left remark: it's wrong to say "believes in science".  Instead, it should really say "accepts science"
[01:16:00] <ciphrCat> the reason is that unlike religion, science does not require faith.  You don't "believe" in science.. you either accept it, or you don't.
[01:17:51] <grieoippe> you could correct it...

[02:07:48] <arash> what does "troll" means ?
[02:09:09] <tinwhiskers> trolling is a type of fishing, towing a lure behind a boat. Internet trolling is similar, setting out bait and hoping someone will bite.
[02:09:40] <tinwhiskers> but then people get the word mixed up with the creature called a troll (that lives under a bridge for example).
[02:11:46] *** Quits: DevAntoine (~DevAntoin@78.196.234.32) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[02:16:07] <tinwhiskers> I think most people don't know trolling originally comes from fishing because they don't know what trolling is. Most people incorrectly think the fishing technique is called trawling, but that's an entirely different method (dragging a large net across the ocean floor)
[02:16:52] <tinwhiskers> So we have this situation where a fair chunk, perhaps even the majority of people, think troll is based on the mythical creature.

[12:08:35] <kurahaupo> Oleg: recall what I said about formal grammar rules being "reverse engineered". Any time we state a rule in simple terms, there's a strong likelihood that we will have neglected some case. 
[12:08:36] <kurahaupo> Oleg: In languages such as Latin that have case markings, nouns and verbs are arbitrarily subdivided into categories that are visible because they alter the suffixes. My theory is that all languages use these fine-grained arbitrary categories, and many more of them than just the 5-10 declensions.  In English they might control, for example, which verbs can and can't take category nouns as objects.

[12:16:44] <kurahaupo> Oleg: On why "music sounds beautifully" is wrong, it's because "to sound" has two meanings: "to have characteristic of" and "to emit audible noise", and most adverbs can only apply to the latter, AND "Music" actually IS noise, is does not EMIT noise. cf "a gun sounds loudly when you fire it".
[12:16:44] <kurahaupo> Oleg: I also have a theory that we have an implicit rule against "near misses"; even if the grammar rules would appear to allow something, we avoid it if it's (a) very rare and (b) too close to something much more common

[20:21:50] <kurahaupo> The ambiguity of adverb vs adjective really isn't helped by the modern pattern of prefix adjectives and postfix adverbs; "I loudly talk" is valid but quite uncommon.
[20:27:20] <kurahaupo> One of my peeves is the switch from "be exactly (the same)" to "(be) the exact same". I'm tempted to switch to "These exactly are the same" to make my point: the adverb/adjective "exact(ly)" modifies the comparison; it's not an attribute of either noun; "the same" is a phrasal adjective

[20:56:05] <spengler_> also, RFC is a term of trade in internet standards.
[20:57:09] <kurahaupo> spengler_: indeed. That probably colours the views of many people here on whether "request a99,99 comment" is useful or valid
[21:00:06] <spengler_> i've seen it used outside of IETF though too. i think Raku used to put 'em out.

[21:19:15] <thojanssens_> hi
[21:20:50] <thojanssens_> are both of these sentences worrect, and if so, which sounds more natural?

[21:21:00] <thojanssens_> 1. The appointment does no longer exist.
[21:21:02] <thojanssens_> 2. The appointment no longer exists.
[21:21:18] <thojanssens_> *correct
[21:21:18] <ksft> the first one has unusual emphasis
[21:21:27] <ksft> it's appropriate in certain circumstances
[21:21:36] <ksft> what's the context?
[21:21:50] <pussipupu> the former is weird enough it would probably generally be considered an error
[21:21:55] <thojanssens_> ksft, it's for an error message though on a web interface (when trying to update an appointment that was deleted). does the emphasis makes sense in that context?
[21:22:08] <ksft> no, I would strongly prefer the second one there

[21:32:26] <Oleg> why is it correct to use the definite article in the construction "the first chapter", but not correct to use it in "chapter one"? How are "the first chapter" and "chapter one" different in meaning?
