[00:02:32] <Blondie101010> birkoff:  perhaps you should give something we can reproduce
[00:02:38] <tirnanog> |& weill result in stderr no longer being directed to a tty, as well as combining it with stdout. you shouldn't do that in this instance.
[00:03:15] <Blondie101010> that does not explain the problem
[00:03:52] <Blondie101010> `cat /dev/zero |pv -f |& cat` and `cat /dev/zero |pv -f | cat` both behave exactly as expected, and neither matches the problem description
[00:04:08] <twkm> "... progress will be shown on standard error."
[00:04:11] <tirnanog> maybe for pv, but I still stand by the advice.
[00:04:58] *** Joins: miique (~miique@181.46.139.166)
[00:05:17] <tirnanog> it's fairly common for programs to vary their behaviour based on an isatty check but, even if pv doesn't, mixing stderr with stdout will seldom be useful. I believe you, though.
[00:05:29] <Blondie101010> the problem reported must be related to how it's called
[00:05:41] * Blondie101010 nods
[00:07:11] <Blondie101010> pv is certainly designed to show its stats in interactive mode
[00:08:04] *** Joins: esselfe (~steph@user/esselfe)
[00:09:06] <tirnanog> birkoff: was that the full command, in its entirety?
[00:09:46] <Blondie101010> I doubt that will be sufficient to know the context unless it involves ssh
[00:10:43] <birkoff> tirnanog: how can i then explicitly redirect err to a command ?
[00:11:18] <Blondie101010> 2> >(command)
[00:11:35] <Blondie101010> but that seems very disconnected from the previous question
[00:11:49] <twkm> stderr is where pv expects to send the progress bar.
[00:12:09] <Blondie101010> yes, on a tty
[00:12:12] <twkm> wtf is the command going to do with pv's progress bar?
[00:12:23] <tirnanog> worse, it would corrupt the stream being conveyed.
[00:12:26] <twkm> check for it reaching 100%?
[00:12:42] <tirnanog> (using |&, to be clear)

[00:13:09] <twkm> anyway, ''pv -f |& cat'' yields a progress bar for me.
[00:13:16] <tirnanog> anyway, I can't reproduce the outcome initially described in a terminal.
[00:13:24] <Blondie101010> obviously
[00:13:48] <Blondie101010> birkoff:  why don't you give us a test case please!
[00:14:32] <birkoff> is it so hard to come up with one ? mine is `find . | ....`
[00:14:51] <Blondie101010> no, that alone won't change anything
[00:14:52] <twkm> works for me.

[00:15:12] <birkoff> how?
[00:15:16] <Blondie101010> yes how
[00:15:22] <twkm> of course you can't "see" the progress separate from the flood of results from find.
[00:15:26] <birkoff> I type it and at the end of line I press enter
[00:15:28] <Blondie101010> not in an interactive shell for sure
[00:15:44] <Blondie101010> ok well show the full command

[00:16:16] <twkm> you are the supplicant, don't make us form what is failing for you.
[00:16:35] <birkoff> your solution 2> >( ) is the solution for me though, thanks
[00:17:06] <twkm> |& dups fd2 to fd1, you made fd1 go away.
[00:17:10] <Blondie101010> ehhh you redirect your output to /dev/null
[00:17:12] <tirnanog> instead of being a smart arse, you could have answered the question.
[00:17:18] <tirnanog> because only now is it obvious what the problem is.
[00:17:31] <birkoff> tirnanog: i dont think so
[00:17:32] <tirnanog> (and twkm beat me to it)
[00:17:34] <tirnanog> yes, so.
[00:18:06] <birkoff> Blondie101010 understood very well on the first time
[00:18:08] <tirnanog> the >/dev/null on pv changes everything.
[00:18:24] <tirnanog> nope. you didn't provide the applicable context. this is a fact.
[00:18:24] <birkoff> no, pv uses stderr for its output
[00:18:27] <Blondie101010> it makes it useless
[00:18:34] <birkoff> stdout is for its stdin
[00:18:40] <twkm> i tried what you said initially, it failed to fail.  i tried what you then added, that too failed to fail.  only when you finally added the >/dev/null did it fail as you stated.
[00:18:56] <tirnanog> bah, plonk.
[00:19:56] <birkoff> oh I have must have forgotten that
[00:19:59] <birkoff> my bad
[00:20:06] <tirnanog> total waste of time.
[00:22:05] <tirnanog> Blondie101010: and it was never obvious, for the record. the progress bar _is_ printed to stderr. only the  >/dev/null |& changed everything. there is a reason for enquiring as to the exact nature of the command that was truly run.
[00:22:31] <Blondie101010> we all asked for it repeatedly
[00:24:07] <tirnanog> in the end, fd 1 ends up being sent to /dev/null, fd 2 is dup'd from fd 1 but we were just supposed to guess based on a command that has no such effect by some midwit smart-arse. sure.

[04:52:28] <slaughter> doesn't* - I'll see what I can do
[04:52:29] <tirnanog> I mean, it's specifically showing you what the string being parsed is.
[04:52:42] <micah> I want to monitor a log file for a specific text pattern, and execute a command with the log line when it is found. What is the best way to do that? I'm surprised there isn't a tool that does this
[04:52:51] <tirnanog> those double quotes simply shouldn't be part of the argument.
[04:53:36] <tirnanog> you can use double quotes in the *shell* to quote an argument. that's fine. but somehow, you're injecting double quotes into the payload, as it were.
[04:53:40] <neshpion> micah: what about `tail -f logfile | { grep -q 'pattern' && do_thing; }` ?
[04:53:59] <slaughter> I guess that means that the jq on the runner is also not working like it is locally, since I'm pulling the date there out of some JSON with jq and testing locally it also doesn't have double quotes
[04:53:59] <tirnanog> so you should show what you're really doing if you want help debugging that.
[04:54:27] <micah> neshpion: i need to pass the line that grep would find to the 'do_thing' though
[04:54:48] <slaughter> Hmm I entered and exited bash locally and now it does have double quotes. OK, noted. Thanks!
[04:54:49] <tirnanog> slaughter: jq -r might be a solution, depending.
[04:54:59] <neshpion> micah: ok then something like `while IFS= read -r line; do if [[ $line =~ pattern ]]; then do_thing_with "$line"; done < <(tail -f logfile)`

[05:52:10] <MarchHare> I'm trying to tune a regex to get rid of lines with whitespace, # comments only, or a combination of whitespace and comments
[05:53:26] <MarchHare> The one I have sort of works, but I'd like to get it tuned correctly the way the sed one I used worked.
[05:55:04] *** Joins: hubvu (sid495858@user/hubvu)
[05:55:42] <neshpion> it's POSIX extended regex, but unfortunately regex101.com doesn't have that option
[05:56:23] <MarchHare> nescafe1001: I noticed it only had the options for javascript and perl and some stuff
[05:57:09] <MarchHare> This one seem good to you neshpion? https://www.regextester.com/99203
[05:58:13] <MarchHare> I'm not sure if perl PCRE and Posix extended are especially compatible
[05:58:46] <neshpion> they seem "mostly" similar if you avoid fancy things like \d and lookarounds
[06:00:20] <MarchHare> nescafe1001: I probably am. I'm just using it to parse a file that contains directory names and #comments. I want to knock out the blank lines and lines with comments only (whether preceeded by whitespace or not)
[06:00:22] <neshpion> for your scenario i would try [[ ! $line =~ ^\s*#.*$ ]] to match all non-whitespace-and-maybe-comments-and-even-empty lines
[06:00:29] <neshpion> also you are pinging the wrong nick
[06:00:33] <tirnanog> I found an ERE one once but it was rubbish. besides, the dialect is quite simple to begin with. PCRE is mostly a superset so, as noted, conventional testing services can be useful up to a point.
[06:00:56] <tirnanog> \s would need to be [[:space:]], by the way.
[06:01:02] <MarchHare> neshpion: Is \s considered standard, or should I be using [[:blank:]]?
[06:01:03] <neshpion> oops
[06:01:15] <neshpion> [[:space:]] apparently
[06:02:00] <MarchHare> neshpion: Okay, just wanted to be sure. I'm trying to update a script. Here's the original. Kind of handy. https://gist.github.com/Hordeking/46ee17c0b065ee0820ce1cce8fa34037
[06:02:09] <tirnanog> [[:blank:]] is also fine if it does what you want (matching a space or a tab only).
[06:02:32] <MarchHare> neshpion: The improvements basically involve collecting the problem-repositories and spitting them out at the end of the script.
[06:03:56] <MarchHare> tirnanog: Which one collects more whitespace stuff? I don't really care what the blanks are.
[06:04:01] <tirnanog> [[:space:]]
[06:04:11] <neshpion> !check https://gist.github.com/Hordeking/46ee17c0b065ee0820ce1cce8fa34037/raw
[06:04:12] <checkbot> neshpion: Line 37: Use 'popd ... || exit' or 'popd ... || return' in case popd fails. Line 11: Note that A && B || C is not if-then-else. C may run when A is true. Line 31: read without -r will mangle backslashes. See https://shellcheck.net/?id=cb58852 for all 5 issues.
[06:04:59] <nescafe1001> MarchHare: Yep, totally wrong nick.  Also, I seem to still be in this channel.
[06:05:12] <neshpion> nescafe1001: no escape
[06:05:14] <tirnanog> using \s in grep without specifying GNU's -P option is a big naughty also. but that could just as well be grep -E and have \s be replaced with [[:space:]].
[06:05:17] <MarchHare> neshpion: It's catching a lot of the stuff I've taken out now. The real issue was trying to cat onto the end of a variable in a subshell
[06:05:51] <MarchHare> tirnanog, neshpion: Let me post the current iteration and see what you can make of it.
[06:05:53] * neshpion just uses rg -P for magic and fast
[06:06:57] <MarchHare> neshpion, tirnanog: Here's the current one. The guts are replaced a bit. I do like this one better. https://pastebin.com/wyshZ4C6
[06:06:57] <pasteban> Paste is available without ads on https://pastebin.com/raw/wyshZ4C6
[06:07:30] <MarchHare> Trying to make it a bit more robust and stuff.
[06:07:49] <MarchHare> Usually my scripts are very much quick and dirty. The original of this one is no exception
[06:08:18] <MarchHare> I'm also an asm and C programmer, so my bash scripting tends to be a bit simplistic
[06:08:23] <nescafe1001> but looking at that snippet, my usual advice applies, which mainly consists of using [[ ]] instead of [ ] everywhere, using if instead of conditionals when you are spanning more than one line, using here docs instead of repeated echos, etc.
[06:08:23] <tirnanog> when asking for help with pattern matching, it's exceptionally useful to provide some sample input, by the way. in this case, a representative sample of what's in "$REPOFILE" along with a brief explanation of the intent. parden me if that was already specified as I'm starting to get sleepy.
[06:09:26] <MarchHare> https://pastebin.com/raw/FG740tnK
[06:10:09] <MarchHare> There's the sample file. foonn are valid, up to date repoes. There's a foo1 that they have as their origin. foo1 isn't included in this file because it has nowhere to pull from
[06:10:49] <MarchHare> The old script would parse it just fine, the new one has the regex not fail on blank lines properly. So I'm trying to tune it
[06:11:36] <tirnanog> does it really have carriage returns or is that pastebin.com being pastebin.com
[06:11:49] <MarchHare> tirnanog: Good question, let me check that.
[06:11:58] <tirnanog> I suspect the latter.
[06:12:15] <MarchHare> Looks like 0x0a for mine, no crlf pairs
[06:12:57] <MarchHare> (Though actually, given my tinkering with the terminal hardware on bare metal, I'm a bit of a cr-lf purist, they DO have different functions)
[06:15:28] <MarchHare> Oh, "foo2 test" is a directory with a space in the name, I added that later to test, too
[06:15:38] <tirnanog> ok. there's no mechanism for blank line removal here. grep -v '^\s*#\|^$' could be grep -vE '^[[:space:]]*$'. the pattern that is currently ^\s*# is redundant, as far as I can see, because the only lines that could match that pattern would already be deleted by the present sed code.
[06:15:58] <tirnanog> of course, it could be done in bash also but as an initial observation.
[06:16:26] <MarchHare> tirnanog: Originally I did that with sed. What's considered robust?

[06:17:25] <tirnanog> whatver is implemented in acccordance with your requirements and correctly. certainly ^[[:space:]]*$ would also work in sed. it's both a valid BRE and ERE.
[06:17:47] *** Joins: nattiestnate (~nate@114.122.105.227)
[06:17:54] <tirnanog> incidentally, if you're using linux, regex(7) is a great little man page on the matter of ERE and BRE.
[06:18:00] <MarchHare> I think the new code is intended to do a continue on an invalid line. I didn't write that. I'm in the process of getting to know it and tuning it correctly to my needs.
[06:18:08] <tirnanog> ok.
[06:18:22] <tirnanog> so, we can pretend sed and grep aren't there and go based on requirements then.
[06:18:28] <tirnanog> (maybe)
[06:18:54] <MarchHare> I think in my case, that's reasonably, though I can clean $REPLY up with sed, too.
[06:19:07] <MarchHare> Might be easier, honestly.
[06:19:24] <tirnanog> while read line should be "while read -r line" or "while IFS= read -r line" if you want for not line trimming to occur.
[06:19:32] <MarchHare> The original code just stripped out blank lines and comments as you said.
[06:19:49] *** Quits: dob1 (~dob1@user/dob1) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[06:20:43] <MarchHare> tirnanog: In "while IFS= read -r line", is line the line of input itself, or a variable name?
[06:20:51] <tirnanog> a name.
[06:21:09] <MarchHare> tirnanog: Without "line" it dumps it in REPLY?
[06:21:12] <tirnanog> yes.
[06:21:27] <MarchHare> okay, good to know I can change that.
[06:21:53] <MarchHare> so setting IFS=\0 will make it trim lines? I'm fine with line trimming.
[06:22:07] <tirnanog> no. just leave IFS out for that.
[06:22:11] <MarchHare> \0 in this case is just a placeholder, not a true null
[06:22:28] <tirnanog> but always use -r.
[06:23:07] <MarchHare> what's the man command for read -r? I'm getting the system call
[06:23:56] <tirnanog> "help read" for a quick-reference. otherwise the bash man page. if you have a read(1) man page, it won't describe the features of the bash builtin.
[06:24:22] <tirnanog> or read(1p) as the case may be.
[06:24:37] <tirnanog> in short, you need to read bash documentation to be reading about bash builtins.
[06:24:55] <MarchHare> okay, that explains it. I've got that pulled up now.
[06:25:32] <MarchHare> Looks like -r is a sanitization flag?

[06:25:50] <tirnanog> it stops backslashes from being meaningful.
[06:25:54] <tirnanog> it's almost always what you want.
[06:26:34] <MarchHare> tirnanog: Definitely safer, I can imagine. In my case, there shouldn't be anything needing to be escaped in a text file.
[06:26:38] <tirnanog> still.
[06:28:17] <MarchHare> So in my case, why isn't read -r trimming out these blank lines?
[06:28:30] <MarchHare> I guess that's on me to figure out
[06:28:31] <tirnanog> it doesn't remove lines.
[06:28:34] <tirnanog> it trims them.
[06:28:44] <tirnanog> leading and trailing whitespace will be stripped out. that's all.
[06:28:56] <MarchHare> So basically I'm getting back a ^$ into the regex if it's whitespace
[06:30:26] <tirnanog> echo '    ' | { read -r line; [[ $line ]] || echo "nothing"; }

[06:34:14] <tirnanog> also, keep in mind that the trimming is based on the characters of IFS which, by default are:

[06:35:30] <MarchHare> How does trimming a newline help? Wouldn't that merge two lines, or is it just trimming multiple consec newlines?

[06:35:57] <tirnanog> that IFS contains a newline doesn't matter in this case, because read is only reading as far as a newline anyway (-d wasn't specified).
[06:36:05] <tirnanog> you can pretend it's not there.
[06:36:12] <MarchHare> Honestly, I'll probably trim the lines, check for emptiness, strip the comments, and go from there :)
[06:36:21] <tirnanog> ok.
[06:36:22] <MarchHare> Perhaps strip the comment first
[06:36:42] <MarchHare> then trim and check for empty. That's basically what the original script did.

[06:37:05] <tirnanog> would make sense, as you support trailing comments. though, I really wonder whether you can't just make this simpler by doing something like ...

[06:38:41] <Blondie101010> -v
[06:39:20] <tirnanog> heck, you could just read the first field if that is considered acceptable.

[06:40:22] <tirnanog> yes, but consider the above, where you just read the first whitespace separated field into repo.

[06:54:25] <tirnanog> I didn't notice that one.
[06:54:46] <MarchHare> I'm assuming that's read -r doing that one?
[06:55:39] <tirnanog> so you have directories with whitespace. better go back to reading whole lines then.

[07:32:28] <tirnanog> I would also advise against explicitly reading into REPLY. there's a confusing discrepancy as to how read works where no names are specified.
[07:32:55] <MarchHare> The script seems to be working in "the real world" (both of my computers with repoes I like to keep updated)

[07:33:25] <tirnanog> notice how these are not the same thing.
[07:33:59] <tirnanog> so, while explicitly writing REPLY isn't technically wrong - and it does end up being handled just as any other name would - it can lull you into thinking that implicit REPLY assignment is no different. but it actually is.
[07:34:30] <MarchHare> So I should probably use a different variable name?
[07:34:34] <tirnanog> yeah, I would.
[07:34:46] <MarchHare> tirnanog: I'll just call it LINE and be done.
[07:34:48] <tirnanog> it won't change the behaviour but it makes the distinction clear.
[07:35:21] <tirnanog> implict REPLY assignment always gives the line verbatim (IFS be damned), which is a definite inconsistency. though sometimes useful.
[07:35:29] <MarchHare> I thought read -r trimmed unless you used IFS=
[07:35:47] <tirnanog> it does where a name is specified.
[07:36:01] <tirnanog> it's just a dumb inconsistency that's been around forever and isn't likely to change.

[07:43:03] <MarchHare> tirnanog: I assume we're talking about the Bash tome in this case?
[07:43:09] <tirnanog> word splitting is based on each character assigned to IFS.
[07:43:13] <MarchHare> That's denser reading than I feel up to tonight.
[07:43:24] <tirnanog> if IFS has an empty string as its value, there's nothing to split on.

[07:43:28] <tirnanog> yes.
[07:43:35] <pj> The trimming can be rather useful sometimes if you want that as a feature.

[12:10:17] <emanuele6> that will only "work" if there is exactly one path that matches that glob
[12:10:47] <pun> emanuele6: yes, that's the case
[12:10:52] <emanuele6> you want something like:   for JAVA_HOME in /usr/lib/jvm/*jdk; do break; done
[12:10:57] <emanuele6> and then export JAVA_HOME
[12:11:18] <emanuele6> that will give you the first match
[12:11:30] <emanuele6> but you probably want the last match now that i think about it
[12:11:37] <emanuele6> so    for JAVA_HOME in /usr/lib/jvm/*jdk; do :; done
[12:11:40] <emanuele6> : instead of break
[12:11:49] *** Quits: adac (~adac@31.207.101.82) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[12:12:13] <pun> it's always just a folder, I just don't want to change 18 to 19 and so on in 'java-18-openjdk'
[12:12:14] <emanuele6> that will set JAVA_HOME to the last match (alphabetical order) for that glob
[12:12:39] <pun> there won't be more than one folder that has that naming scheme
[12:13:18] <emanuele6> # mkdir -p /usr/lib/jvm/java-18-openjdk; for JAVA_HOME in /usr/lib/jvm/*jdk; do :; done; declare -p JAVA_HOME
[12:13:19] <shbot> emanuele6: declare -- JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-18-openjdk"
[12:13:21] <emanuele6> it works

[12:14:41] <pun> mkdir -p /usr/lib/jvm/java-{10..20}-openjdk; won't this create all those empty folders ?

[12:17:04] <emanuele6> in bash you can write the same thing as      : /usr/lib/jvm/*jdk
[12:17:19] <emanuele6> followed on the next line by    export JAVA_HOME=$_
[12:17:38] <emanuele6> but that has a slightly different behaviour if there are no matches

[12:19:25] <emanuele6> oh, well, not really
[12:19:27] <emanuele6> nevermind
[12:19:45] <emanuele6> same behaviour unless you set nullglob
[12:20:07] <emanuele6> so either:    for JAVA_HOME in /usr/lib/jvm/*jdk; do :; done; export JAVA_HOME

[12:21:26] <kurahaupo_> ^^^ lexicographical sort order
[12:21:30] <emanuele6> yes
[12:22:03] <emanuele6> so just use `break' since there is no benefit on using the last match anyway

[12:44:51] *** Joins: uuidNuniq (~weechat@146.56.136.247)

[12:45:26] <nvz> it however is dependant on the terminal in use, and you aren't necessarily in control of if color can be shown or which color will be shown

[14:35:28] <vjipac> nvz: what should i learn then?
[14:36:22] <nvz> well depends on your tastes I suppose, I go with python, but some folk prefer perl, pascal, php, nodejs, etc..
[14:36:54] <nvz> bash just so happens to have a decent scripting language for shell tasks, but its not very well suited for actual programming
[14:37:45] <vjipac> nvz: i think python would be better.. as it is used on tons of things. i'll go with python...

[14:40:09] <nvz> vjipac: well one problem you'd likely have with python I can see from your bash coding is that python is whitespace sensitive
[14:40:22] <nvz> your indentation on that bash script isn't the greatest
[14:41:08] <vjipac> nvz: what is "whitespace sensitive" ??
[14:41:23] <nvz> its fairly common to use 4 spaces in place of tabs.. and most any editor a programmer should be using is able to just put in those 4 spaces when you hit tab rather than an actual tab character
[14:41:59] *** Joins: The_Loko (~The_Loko@79.116.24.80)
[14:42:03] <nvz> vjipac: whitespace sensitive means the interpreter actually interprets things like spaces and tabs.. and in python's case it uses them to form blocks of code rather than using {} like many other languages do
[14:42:50] <nvz> vjipac: in order for python to understand where blocks begin and end the whitespace MUST be consistent.. you cant have a line with a tab char and another line with the same number of spaces to make it APPEAR to be in the same column
[14:43:54] *** Joins: zeden (~zeden@user/zeden)
[14:44:05] <vjipac> nvz: ohh.. i get it now.. that means one tab and 4 spaces are not same in python.. right??
[14:44:43] <nvz> not only that but the indentation tells the interpreter where the blocks in code are.. there are no function foo { code goes here } type things

I just suggested it cause not only would using an actual development environment help you code more efficiently, but with something like liveshare you could collaborate in real time with people to get help
[14:59:07] <nvz> its super cool to me that you can do so with someone who need not even have the program installed

[19:36:32] <rendar> i have < <( my_fn ... ) in a 'while' case, but i want to execute my_fn2 instead of my_fn in there, under some condition, what is the best way to to do this?
[19:37:07] <llua> the same way you would do so outside of < <( )

[20:58:37] <earendel> slaughter: that's the iso utc norm. maybe that helps.
[20:59:50] <slaughter> earendel yeah it was just a matter of double quotes. zsh did some fun help that was hiding that issue from me when running locally. All good now :)
[21:00:18] * earendel thumbsup
[21:01:05] <earendel> my fav date format.
[21:01:39] <earendel> slaughter: how can i parse it with GNU coreutils, btw?
[21:02:00] <slaughter> On mac I just used `gdate -d $THE_DATE_STRING +%s`
[21:02:12] <slaughter> +%s optional, since I was converting to epoch seconds
[21:02:18] <slaughter> And gdate comes from `brew install coreutils`
[21:02:20] <earendel> hm. ok. thanks.
