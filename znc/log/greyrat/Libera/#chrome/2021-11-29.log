[08:17:16] <morganu> ubu20.04 LTS: my chrome just updated and I have no menu and 3 of my 4 windows with tabs vanished and I AM NOT HAPPY. I cant even look at my history because I have no  ...  menu to go to .
[08:17:35] <morganu> I will check in here tomorrow morning to see what feedback I have gotten.
[08:19:38] <morganu> Plus something has been gripping my computer to slowdown so much it is basically frozen and doing "killall chrome -9" always fixes it. * I have been working on this with #ubuntu for almost a year. OC they only talk of the system and we dont get into "chrome" there.
