[00:01:13] <dan01[m]> Hi
[00:03:50] <dan01[m]> About sub-shells, new shells etc
[00:04:33] <dan01[m]> I see you can't execute a shell scrip if you do ./test.sh if the file is not executable
[00:04:45] <dan01[m]> But, you can run it via bash test.sh
[00:05:01] <geirha> indeed
[00:05:20] <phy1729> in the latter case you aren't executing the file, you're executing bash and bash happens to run the file given as an argument
[00:05:50] <dan01[m]> phy1729: true
[00:06:28] <dan01[m]> But from what I can see executing this way, with bash first, doesn't produce side effects, correct?
[00:06:44] <geirha> there's no difference
[00:06:47] <phy1729> depends on what you mean by side effects
[00:06:49] <dan01[m]> Like if you export a variable, it won't actually survive, it will terminate with the new bash instance you run
[00:06:50] <geirha> making a script executable is merely a convenience; to make it easier to run, to make it a full-fledged command
[00:06:53] <larryv> the script doesn't run in the current shell environment either way
[00:07:18] <dan01[m]> larryv: ./ produces a sub-shell, right?
[00:07:29] *** Quits: tomaw (tom@libera/staff/tomaw) (Quit: Quitting)
[00:07:31] <geirha> no, ./ is just a path
[00:07:32] <phy1729> subshell generally referrs to  ( this construct; )
[00:07:52] <greycat> !subshell
[00:07:52] <greybot> http://mywiki.wooledge.org/SubShell
[00:07:55] <phy1729> you have a child process that happens to also be a shell
[00:08:02] <dan01[m]> phy1729: for example if one exports a variable in the script, if runned with bash test.sh, it wont' actually export
[00:08:29] <geirha> nor will it when you run ./test.sh, exactly for the same reason, because it ends up running bash ./test.sh
[00:08:33] <phy1729> similarly if you run a python script, variables set there don't show up in your shell
[00:08:49] <phy1729> sourcing is different because your shell is executing the commands

[00:43:25] <jjakob> can you for loop over strings with globs and then later expand the globs inside the for loop?
[00:44:28] <larryv> uhm
[00:44:30] <twkm> yes.
[00:45:08] <larryv> what, like for glob in '*.txt' '*.png' '*.bash'; do foo $glob; done
[00:45:08] <greycat> 1981 did that bullshit all the time.
[00:45:12] <twkm> for g in 'a*z' 'f??k'; do ... $g ...; done
[00:45:31] <twkm> the $g can e unsafe though.
[00:45:39] <twkm> err, can be.
[00:45:53] <greycat> This entire paradigm is doomed to failure if the filenames are not carefully controlled.
[00:45:56] <twkm> such as when there's whitespace in the glo.
[00:46:07] <twkm> hmm, b is mad at me today.
[00:46:48] <jjakob> yes because I want to: for f in 'file1' 'file2-*' 'file3-*'; do echo /some/long/path/to/$f; done
[00:46:49] <twkm> for g in 'a*z' 'f??k'; do f=($g); ... "${f[@]}" ...; done
[00:47:13] <twkm> why not let the glob expand at the for?

[01:47:59] <twkm> i.e., without -r the \ at the end of the line tells read that there's more to come, so it issues a PS2 prompt and waits for the next line.  it combines the first line with the second, unless it too ends with a \ then the cycle repeats.
[01:48:19] <xmb_> say without -r is not normal read =p
[01:48:55] <xmb_> while without -r u can prolly pipe arrow keys and such to it
[01:49:09] <xmb_> no idea sorry i nevermind sorry
[01:49:59] <homogol> I kinda got it but to be specific what about "escape the delimiters" part? what delimiter it scapes in this way?

[03:36:50] <alienhead> Because python script is incredible simple, user input is a builtin function of python, there isnt much to change

[03:37:52] <xmb_> read -rp 'plz enter: ' entered ; pgrep -x "$entered"
[03:38:04] <xmb_> or the subshell variant above, ..
[03:38:15] <alienhead> not really but I can read an article and come back
[03:38:19] <tirnanog> ok.
[03:38:27] <alienhead> stderr is standard error right

[03:39:00] <alienhead> I need a break though this is making my head hurt
[03:39:13] <larryv> alienhead: are you just using input()?
[03:39:25] <tirnanog> alienhead: in your interactive terminal, both stdout and stderr will be directed to it. when you use "$(command substitution)" in the shell, you are requested for the standard output stream to be collected and treated as a word - a single argument to pgrep in this case.
[03:39:26] <alienhead> using input and printing it
[03:39:48] <tirnanog> the problem is that you spew _both_ your prompt string _and_ the given input to stdout.

[03:40:43] <alienhead> Okay

[03:41:07] <tirnanog> that way, the command substitution will only gather that it is supposed to.

[04:30:42] <[a]> Well said, xmb_nixmb.   As the Battlestar Galactica folks say, "So say we all."
[04:31:04] <larryv> also "Add prefix '~/' for files beginning with a '.' to make relative path" why?
[04:31:06] <xmb_nixmb> [a] i meant there is simple as in few lines port static ip static file static transfer
[04:31:16] <xmb_nixmb> then there is [a] complete which covers 1000% more
[04:31:26] <larryv> *sorry, cut that off. "Add prefix '~/' for files beginning with a '.' to make relative path absolute"
[04:31:36] <at_work> Isn't there a discord for this nonsense?
[04:31:39] <greycat> Tilde expansion only occurs at a few specifically defined places, and only when the ~ is part of the actual command.  Never when it's part of an expansion.
[04:31:47] <larryv> at_work: if only.
[04:33:10] <[a]> xmb_nixmb, I'll start with /dev/tcp ... because i maintain at least 1000 FreeBSD/*Nix/GNULinux boxen and not everyone of these has nc, socat , etc..
[04:33:23] <|xD> lol
[04:33:25] <at_work> you should add that ${HOME} is available
[04:33:26] <jensen> i want files displayed by fzf to show ~ for readability and display them as full paths. The git command shows them as relative to $HOME so i add them for those. The find command portion prints the absolute path, so I replace ~ for /home/user

[04:34:17] <[a]> xmb_nixmb ; Cool... thanks in advamce
[04:34:54] <|xD> IT security 0%
[04:35:11] <larryv> jensen: it doesn't really matter why you're doing any of that. if fzf leaves the ~/ in the file variable then bash isn't going to expand that
[04:35:11] <xmb_nixmb> not sure actually to use /dev/tcp to listen....
[04:35:39] <xmb_nixmb>               /dev/tcp/host/port
[04:35:39] <xmb_nixmb>                      If host is a valid hostname or Internet address, and port is an integer port
[04:35:39] <xmb_nixmb>                      number or service name, bash attempts to open the corresponding TCP socket.
[04:35:42] <jensen> yea so i need to expand that back to $HOME
[04:35:54] <xmb_nixmb> add -v home="$HOME"
[04:36:05] <greycat> if the ~ is in a variable, you can perform your own manual substitution on it
[04:36:27] <xmb_nixmb> greycat, is there a way to listen on a port via /dev/tcp ? is it only use port number ?
[04:36:49] <greycat> No.
[04:37:02] <greycat> Use tcpserver or xinetd or something equivalent.

[05:42:12] <xmb_nixmb> again, folks, everyone, im looking for and to do code, not english misunderstandings
[05:42:52] <greycat> The problem with that is: when you have a *problem* with the code, you need to explain the intent.
[05:43:22] <greycat> If the code actually works, then it might be a valid form of communication all by itself.  But if it has errors, it's not.
[05:44:50] <xmb_nixmb> that is so mate, however i edge to conflicts then instead of solutions, sometimes
[05:45:12] <xmb_nixmb> u know im like, a person comes and asks, i answer, [code] or so

[16:35:39] <Masklin__Gurder> But uhm, it does nothing when opening new terminal windows for example
[16:35:51] <Masklin__Gurder> My path is the default path though I have source .bashrc in my .profile
[16:36:02] <Masklin__Gurder> Uhm sorry that made no sense
[16:36:20] <Masklin__Gurder> I have PATH updates in .profile, anyway, and not in .bashrc.
[16:36:21] <geirha> .bash_profile/.profile is read when bash is started in login mode (bash -l)
[16:36:35] <geirha> when started interactively, and NOT in login mode, it will read .bashrc instead
[16:36:58] <Masklin__Gurder> Okay but then what sense is there in moving the PATH updates from .bashrc to .profile?
[16:37:35] <geirha> usually, PATH changes are rare enough that .profile will suffice.
[16:37:48] <Masklin__Gurder> Seems opening a new terminal window or tab does not by default use "-l"
[16:37:55] <geirha> appending/prepending stuff to PATH from .bashrc, requires more complexity, and they will only be available to the shell

[16:39:55] <geirha> you can run a login shell in various ways inside a terminal, to test it out,  e.g.  sudo -iu "$USER"  or  su - "$USER"  or  ssh localhost
[16:40:00] <Masklin__Gurder> So you're saying that, if I put my PATH+= in .profile, log out, log in, and open terminals and terminal tabs, they will all have the updated path?

[16:41:15] <geirha> depends on what you have in .profile
[16:41:28] <Masklin__Gurder> Only path and manpath updates
[16:41:38] <geirha> if it appends stuff, you'll quickly get duplicates appended
[16:42:15] <geirha> which isn't really dangerous, just a waste of env space
[16:42:22] <Masklin__Gurder> You'd think so but it seems like no duplicates are created
[16:42:56] <Masklin__Gurder> The reason I'm digging in this is because having PATH updates in .bashrc caused duplicates whenever I wrote 'bash' (lazy way of re-loading .bashrc)
[16:43:43] <Masklin__Gurder> After having changed the terminal client's command to "/usr/bin/bash -l", I don't have that problem.
[16:44:31] <Masklin__Gurder> And yes the path updates are all appending.

[19:50:37] <OnlineCop> I have a bash function that prepends $'\n' to a variable, does some formatting, then removes the `\n` when it's done. When I `type my_function`, it shows `local val='[newline]'"${!var}";` (where [newline] is a literal newline). Is there a way to display this function with that newline translated into the two-character "\n" somehow?

[20:16:50] <Soliton> thus the suggestion was to use printf instead so you don't have a literal newline in your code.

[20:18:47] <Soliton> saving the output of sed again in a variable only to immediately print it seems useless, btw.
