[00:53:38] <mdogg> When you quote someone you quote their comma and period use as well.  Example:  “The problem with opinions,” Paula explained, “is that everyone has one.”

[00:56:58] <mdogg> “That is just the way with some people.  They get down on a thing when they don’t know nothing about it."  ― Mark Twain, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn 
[00:57:43] <toretto> mdogg: so in short, for both cases that I've mentioend, the correct answer is (a) right?
[01:00:24] <mdogg> toretto: In example 'a' you are not quoting somebody.  The quotation in that example are used to define "foo".   <-- 
[01:00:45] <mdogg> Case 2 - can you give me more of an example?
[01:01:22] <mdogg> Oh wait - I think I see what you're saying.

[01:02:20] * toretto gives chat a cookie.
[01:03:12] <mdogg> Since you aren't quoting somebody then the period or comma should be outside the quotation marks.  In your example, you are using quotes to emphasize a word or phrase rather than to provide a quote.

[01:06:58] <mdogg> Correct, since you are not quoting somebody with your "comma" or "period", the punctuation belongs to you.  If you are quoting somebody who used a comma or period in their sentence, then you need to include it in the quote.

[20:24:40] <huf> I think that's what an acronym is
[20:24:48] <huf> and what we usually call an acronym is supposedly an initialism?
[20:24:49] <cAMP> "Like Suppose For Example" became "Lisufexa"?
[20:25:18] <huf> "abbreviation"?
[20:26:13] <huf> I think of it as the eastern style abbreivation, because based on my sample size of ... 4
[20:26:17] <huf> it's more common in the east :)
[20:27:46] <cAMP> So, "Zero Currency From Open Source Engine" making Zecurfoe could be called an acronym?
[20:28:23] <huf> https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/acronym

[20:29:04] <huf> instead of spelling it out?
