[00:00:10] <wutzelputz> Depending on where you live (and the hry rate u can charge), 200‚Ç¨ for the first year is not a lot of money, and if you stick on a certain php version they don't even force you to upgrade.
[00:00:10] <wutzelputz> I'm also a huge vim nerd but I couldn't get it to do many of the features phpstorm gives me. That ofc also depends on how much time you are willing to spend setting up your vim. But I've spent 100s of hours on the vim setup.
[00:00:10] <wutzelputz> 100% agree with @da_wunder tho, use the tooling that works best for u

[00:00:51] <da_wunder> also note that you can open shell in most of the IDEs - so using those doesn't take out shell part
[00:01:13] <da_wunder> eg. I have shell all the time open in IDE, even sometimes I use IRC from that

[00:03:29] <wutzelputz> If you are at a level where you don't see the value of an ide (which imo mostly lies in discoverability/refactoring of existing code) and just barely get by, use a text editor of your choice. At some point you'll notice recurring tasks that need to be done on code. Then you'll start to appreciate a good ide
[00:03:42] <shinbet> I use shell for everything that can reasonably cut a corner over crappy GUI
[00:04:23] <shinbet> like this here not my code but an amazing example of how shell can cut it https://github.com/abiyani/automate-save-page-as/blob/master/save_page_as
[00:04:32] <da_wunder> wutzelputz: eg. phpstorm gives you nice autocomplete, error detection, etc. features - which are something that will help you to start
[00:04:48] <wutzelputz> @da_wunder sure use cases are different I guess ^^ I use my ide terminal mostly for git and docker stuff
[00:06:45] <shinbet> ofc that script cannot run headless, but when some crappy page is not friendly to "lynx --dump", thats simplest way I've found. Also I've seen that laravel panther, which seems cool but I have to learn a lot more of php to use it
[00:08:21] <da_wunder> wutzelputz: quite similar what I do, although I prefer to use git from IDE directly, docker etc. stuff is runned on IDE shell like - https://pasteboard.co/yY0BQTfPv7qk.png

[00:10:16] <wutzelputz> Yeah those are features I'd like my junior devs to have visible so I don't have to point it out on every code review. Currently I work on a really badly made nodejs project where the company just doesn't (yet) want to spend the money on the ide. Imo if you pay developers (even juniors) > 80k/year its just ridiculous to cheapskate on tooling for 200/year that will save them 40h/year of productive work. Not even to mention they can't stand the
[00:10:17] <wutzelputz> grind of using grep for refactoring and look for better workplaces...
[00:11:34] <da_wunder> you should show those numbers to your company - most likely they understand how much not using proper tools is costing
[00:13:45] <shinbet> wutzelputz, junior developers here earns like 600euro per month at best in here
[00:14:47] <da_wunder> ok, so salary cost for company is like 1000e/month per dev

[00:17:12] <shinbet> da_wunder, a good question. I made these 2 bots that sends specific products when they are listed on shops to send link via telegram for opportunities of quick purchase. and I've spent 10 hours making those bots, how much should i charge ?
[00:17:21] <da_wunder> it's quite easy to calculate - and something like 40h saving in hours per dev is telling literally that benefit in euros
[00:17:57] <wutzelputz> The company I currently work for runs its own product, but I'm also self employed and while my rates range between 60 and 140, 240 are not unusual for contractors. Disclaimer: I'm from Austria
[00:18:56] *** Quits: Kexoni (~Kexoni@user/kexoni) ()
[00:19:14] <shinbet> wutzelputz, full employment here in Lithuania, you get like 600 per month if youre junior. It can go up to 5000 for senior and mid is something hard to put on exact spot in between those earlier mentioned extremes
[00:19:45] <NakedKing> name is serverless but a server is exist always.
[00:20:13] <NakedKing> shinbet,  is it euro?
[00:20:25] <shinbet> NakedKing, yes
[00:20:27] <da_wunder> so average is like ~145 so literally under _two_ hours would cover that if we just use that average on that (and yes it would be a bit bigger hour number) but this should give you some aspect of that cost saving - and how much your company could bill your customers more...
[00:21:33] <wutzelputz> Huh, 600/month is about half of the legal minimum wage in austria. 5k is roundabout what I get as a senior with > 10 years experience, so the upper range doesn't seem so far off.
[00:21:43] <da_wunder> 40*145 = 5800, so that is quite lot improvement for billable hours imho...
[00:24:08] <da_wunder> and if you take those license fees out of that it's still 5.6ke/year per dev, so with 10 devs your company could improve revenue like 56ke/year - and that is lot
[00:24:59] <da_wunder> like you could hire couple of more devs without extra costs if compare the use case when you don't use tools that improve productivity
[00:26:05] <wutzelputz> @shinbet what you should charge for the bot? I would say it heavily depends on what the requirements were and how easy it is to solve the problem. A one off solution can be done in a couple hours. Do they want it to keep working for X years? How much are they willing to invest in the future? Do you need to put in some decent infra to keep the  cost of change low? Is it critical so that automated tests need to be thought of and written?
[00:28:04] <TML> wutzelputz: Personally, I find that about 90% of the programming I do, I am able to outperform most IDEs with a simple text editor like nvi. IMO the only time IDEs really help is when you don't know the language/framework you're working in very well.
[00:28:39] <TML> Most of the time, I can round trip a given edit in nvi before the IDE even finishes launching
[00:31:21] <wutzelputz> @TML depending on what kind of work you do regularly I 100% support your argument. I very often find myself on my terminal (alacritty btw üòç) performing tasks. I'm not trying to advocate for ide vs terminal, just for terminal PLUS ide if it helps
[00:32:02] <shinbet> wutzelputz, some of these questions will only be answered after new year. How I was looking at it because I'm not a professional programmer in a software developement sense. I work in computerized manufacturing, getting something like 5eu per hour. And developement of bots took about 10 hours but it was interesting so I was thinking charging 5eu per hour + deployment in some cloud instance a bit higher sysadmin kind of fee lets say 30euros,
[00:32:03] <shinbet> plus suggesting some support plan that would have to be credited in advance, but you see I was never in programming business so thats just my imagination
[00:32:09] <TML> OK - I probably read too much into your earlier statements, then - carry on
[00:35:43] <da_wunder> wut 5e/h ? I think that is not even legal here
[00:39:28] <wutzelputz> Wow @shinbet so you usually are closer to the metal?
[00:39:28] <wutzelputz> Also yeah that rate stinks.
[00:39:28] <wutzelputz> What I see here in austria and also from some US colleagues is that bigger companies tend to put a lot of value in long term sustainability and maintainability. Sure I can get a script from fiver for 40 bucks, but who's going to update it to my business needs in the long term?
[00:39:57] <wutzelputz> @da_wunder I assume you are also from the German speaking region?
[00:40:32] <shinbet> well its lithuania and my CAD/CNC skills are not that great at the moment, neither I'm interested to be entirely dedicated to that, I wanna make change in computerized manufacturing, combining softwares like nextcloud, dolibarr and some CNC controllers API's or tools in some proper industrial/information/production system, only worked shit jobs in past, now at least getting to touch some bleeding edge hardware here, my salary will rise its
[00:40:32] <shinbet> just I'm working for couple of months here passed trial period only a week ago
