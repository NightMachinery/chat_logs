[04:07:19] <moldorcoder7> im struggling a bit with css :)
[04:08:16] <oksushi> moldorcoder7: .btn_div {margin-left: auto;}
[04:08:52] <moldorcoder7> oksushi, ho indeed , whats the logic ? flex handling it differently ?
[04:09:05] <oksushi> differently to what?
[04:09:32] <moldorcoder7> oksushi, pre flex era :) , ok i ll remember it like this
[04:09:35] <moldorcoder7> thanks a lot
[04:13:47] <dodobrain_> oksushi, any ideas on my flexbox problem(s) ?
[04:16:10] *** Quits: entuland (~entuland@user/entuland) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[04:19:22] <oksushi> dodobrain_: as you have nested elements, you’ll need to make them all display: flex; as well as flex: 1;
[04:19:34] <oksushi> to essentially cascade the “flexiness” down
[04:20:47] <dodobrain_> so i'm not completely sure what to do there. my flexcontainer i ssrt to display:flex. it has 3 children. so i have to set display: flex on item-{1,2,3} as well?
[04:21:22] <oksushi> something like this dodobrain_ https://plnkr.co/edit/197qhk3Y6OJO8a0U
[04:21:39] <oksushi> you need to also make sure that the body is 100% height of the viewport
[04:21:54] *** Joins: entuland (~entuland@user/entuland)
[04:22:46] <dodobrain_> jup, theres no problem with that .. i'm actually able to manipulate the layout of the html only *inside* the usable-area because this is being templated from some other file
[04:22:59] <dodobrain_> and yes the body is set to height correctly (thankfully!)
[04:28:02] <dodobrain_> oksushi, ah i didnt notice something that was different from yours.. i dont have display:flex on my body
[04:28:08] <dodobrain_> is that absolutely needed?
[04:28:57] <oksushi> in cases where you’re trying to make things take “as much space as needed”, it simplifies things
[04:30:34] <dodobrain_> umm.. this complicates things for me because i dont really set styling for things outside usable-area :(
[04:32:06] <dodobrain_> i can set styling on the usable-area element though. would that help ?
[04:33:02] <oksushi> you can set the height of usable-area to 100vh
[04:33:10] <oksushi> which might work in some situations
[04:35:58] <dodobrain_> umm.. it almost works i think
[04:36:11] <dodobrain_> i get a scrollbar worth the height of the top gradient bar i think
[04:42:28] <dodobrain_> oksushi, oooh.. i almost have it.. https://plnkr.co/edit/Y9TH7gf7FcqWAJBp
[04:42:50] <dodobrain_> the only problem i have now is that the table becoming larger is putting a scrollbar on the entire page
[04:43:02] <dodobrain_> i want a scrollbar only on the table or the table's container

[06:08:52] <smallville7123> eg weither the page is displayed in landscape mode or portrait mode or desktop (square)
[06:12:44] <FunkyBob> your desktop has a square display?
[06:13:19] <hendry> Hi, I want two images side by side and top aligned, how do I achieve that? https://jsfiddle.net/kaihendry/64g31noh/
[06:13:40] <smallville7123> dont most desktops/laptops have square displays?
[06:13:58] <hendry> already the validator complains about width="40%" ... not sure why, can width only be pixels?!
[06:14:03] <FunkyBob> smallville7123: err, no... have been rectangular most of my life
[06:14:17] <FunkyBob> smallville7123: 4:3, then 16:9 and 16:10

[06:14:36] <FunkyBob> smallville7123: especially on laptops
[06:14:50] <FunkyBob> hendry: width= is not using CSS... it's an HTML attribute, and is limited to only pixels
[06:14:52] <smallville7123> well mine appears to be square on my macbook
[06:15:26] <smallville7123> tho system info tells me 13.3-inch (1280 x 800)

[06:15:33] <FunkyBob> 1280x800... not square

[15:16:33] <oksushi> height: 100% of someothing with no defined height is nothing

[15:19:01] <fweht> if the parent uses height instead of min-height it works fine
[15:19:47] <oksushi> exactly — the height is then declared

[15:20:28] <fweht> css not always the most intuitive to me :D
[15:21:02] <hassoon> fweht: if you set height 100% on something, all of its ancestors must each have a defined height
