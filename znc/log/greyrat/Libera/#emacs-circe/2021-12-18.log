[01:33:31] <acdw> ahh okay
[01:33:43] <acdw> is there a hook for that or something in circe?
[01:37:59] <wasamasa> there is no hook, no
[01:38:08] <wasamasa> you'd write an event handler
[01:40:14] <acdw> ahhhh okay
[01:43:32] <acdw> i'm trying to find an example
[01:43:53] <acdw> `circe-irc-handler-table' ?
[01:47:44] <wasamasa> no, I mean the uses of `circe-set-display-handler'
[01:48:03] <acdw> ohhhh
[01:50:14] <acdw> thanks for the pointer! i'l have to try this out

[03:40:20] <howard-abrams> Interesting. I've put a workaround for my ZNC login with a /quote PASS ...

[03:52:00] <acdw> howard-abrams what's ignoring the part and quit messages do?
[03:53:02] <howard-abrams> Oh, I stole that from the Circe tips and tricks for ignoring the PART and QUIT messages.
[03:56:12] <howard-abrams> I actually don't think it works ... at least, it doesn't work /all/ the time.
[03:58:35] <acdw> ahhh
[03:58:43] <acdw> oh like ignoring peoples parts and quits
[04:19:15] <howard-abrams> Right

[19:00:25] <ngz> Hello. I use Vertico mode, which is of no use for nick completion in Circe. The reason is Circe calls (as expected) `completion-at-point', whereas Vertico mode only advises `completing-read'. Is there a way to tweak completion system in Circe so it uses completing-read instead?
[19:00:43] <ngz> (disclaimer: I'm not too knowledgeable in Emacs completion system).
[19:01:35] <wasamasa> honestly, I'd just use (setq circe-use-cycle-completion t)
[19:02:06] <wasamasa> there is no need for anything more advanced than inline completion like in every single other IRC client
[19:02:20] <wasamasa> unless you like chasing fun bugs in helm, vertico or whatever
[19:03:51] <ngz> Hmmm, this variable doesn't seem to change anything.
[19:07:45] <wasamasa> if you mean it still doesn't make use of vertico and instead just cycles inline through candidates, then yes, it's working as intended
[19:08:12] <ngz> No, I mean consecutive <tab> or <M-tab> do not cycle through nicknames.
[19:09:01] <wasamasa> in that case, do the bisection dance to find out whether it's your config
[19:09:39] <wasamasa> start with emacs -Q, M-x package-initialize and boot circe without any config

[19:14:55] <ngz> This would be my config. Gasp.
