[00:04:20] <Bayes> krux02 how do you currying in haskell?
[00:04:23] <krux02> as I (just me personally) really dislike cl-loop
[00:04:32] <technomancy> Bayes: you just call the function with fewer args
[00:04:41] <bpalmer> krux02: it turns out that message is misplaced, but rather it should be the return value
[00:04:42] <krux02> Bayes, you define functions with lots of -> -> ->
[00:05:12] <Bayes> in R we have reduce, map, filter, apply, etc I was wondering if there's something for currying specifically or if you just create a function that returns a new function
[00:05:12] <krux02> and then it happens automatically that a function that has too few argumets becomes a function that taken arguments

[06:35:25] <JibStyle> nice, i'll check it out when i have time
[06:35:45] <skangas> acdw: Did you install from GNU ELPA or MELPA?
[06:36:12] <skangas> The version on MELPA seems to be very old
[06:37:15] <acdw> ummmm i used straight.el
[06:37:17] <acdw> so i'm not sure
[06:38:40] <skangas> Well, I've never used it
[06:39:00] <skangas> I just saw that there are two packages, and one is very old. Perhaps that's the version you found.

[10:47:14] <roxlu> hey I was looking into spell checking and I noticed that emacs uses ispell (at least that's described here: https://www.tenderisthebyte.com/blog/2019/06/09/spell-checking-emacs/ ) but I just read that aspell has replaced ispell. I'm curious if I should install ispell or aspell?

[11:17:58] <jtgd> I really like elisp and I hear folks talk about Common Lisp and that seems intriguing, but one thing I like about elisp is that things like buffers are basically a data type that I have available to use. Easy to read in file, iterate over it, write out, etc. But if I used CL I wouldn't have that, right?

[11:29:02] <edgar-rft> jtgd: Common Lisp has READ-SEQUENCE with that you can read a file into a string and WRITE-SEQUENCE with that you can write the string back into a file. A string in Common Lisp is a vector of characters, where in Common Lisp a CHARACTER is a real data type, unlike in Elisp where it's hard to distinguish between characters and integers.

[11:33:06] <edgar-rft> jtgd: An advantage of Emacs over Common Lisp is that in Emacs you have a real-time visual feedback of your buffer on the screen so you can instantly see what you have edited, while in Common Lisp you need to print the string to see your edits.

[11:34:56] <edgar-rft> jtgd: There are several Common Lisp Emacs clones but none of them ever got the popularity of GNU Emacs, not even among Common Lisp hackers. Most of them are using Emacs+Slime to edit their code :-)
[11:35:35] <jtgd> I can read a file into a string in emacs too, but a string is a far cry from a buffer. So many commands deal with navigating by line which is not quite the same as searching for '\n'. sounds like PITA

[14:10:57] <ricky_88> Hi all, I'm using company-mode and gopls as lsp backend in order to lookup function and variable definitions in go projects. On some repositories, when I want to lookup a definition (M-.) I get an unexpected "Visit tags table (default TAGS):..." instead of jumping to the function definition. Like here: https://i.ibb.co/m56bDZx/visit-tags-table.jpg
[14:10:58] <ricky_88> How can I fix this? Thanks! :)

[15:23:30] <ecoli> I wanted to install markdown mode as described here https://github.com/jrblevin/markdown-mode
[15:23:44] <lampilelo> i don't know how well abhijit knows emacs regex, so that needs to be noted as well
[15:24:00] <ecoli> So I appended the listed commands to ~/.emacs and resarted.
[15:24:17] <ecoli> But the package-install cannot find markdown-mode
[15:25:06] <abhijit> lampilelo, yes.
[15:25:19] <abhijit> Thanks all lampilelo wasamasa 
[15:25:50] <lampilelo> ecoli: this doesn't install the package, you need to call package-install to install it, do it manually, i.e. M-x package-install RET markdown-mode RET
[15:26:21] <ricky_88> pkal, I see. I'll try to google that, then. Do you think it's worth switching to eglot? I thought lsp-mode was less hard to get to work...
[15:26:52] <ecoli> I did that lampilelo but M-x package-install RET markdown-mode RET complains "no match"
[15:26:52] <pkal> ricky_88: If anything eglot should be easier, because it is just one package that builds on Emacs' built-in packages
[15:27:08] <pkal> ecoli: When you M-x list-packages, can you find it there?
[15:27:17] <lampilelo> ecoli: do M-x package-refresh-contents RET
[15:27:19] <ecoli> will try.
[15:28:31] <lampilelo> ecoli: or as pkal says, you can install it using the UI, although when you run list-packages you need to wait for the contents to refresh

[20:27:38] <pjb> yes, and since they were designed at first for numeric input, they had only 10 rows.  Then they added 2 more rows, and a code for alphabetic, but this created holes in letters.

[20:28:08] <pjb> Well that became apparent only when we translated hollerith holes into bits…
[20:30:09] <pjb> They mapped the first ten rows to 4 bits (0000 to 1001) and then just added two bits so 000000 … 001001, 010000 … 011001, 100000 … 101001, 110000 … 111001 ;hence 6-bit bytes, and holes in letters.
[20:30:15] <johnjay> so there's a continuity between punched cards, telegraph morse code, and ascii?
[20:30:45] <pjb> With more lamps, they could have made a full binary conversion without holes, but that was more expensive.
[20:31:17] <pjb> johnjay: no, morse code is different.  We're talking here about binary telegraphic code, using 5 baud.

[20:37:31] <pjb> Morse code was a kind of Huffman encoding, with letters that occured often having fewer symbols.

[20:41:15] <pjb> So there doesn't seem to be any coding system that is entirely new; it's an evolution; on the other hand, starting from 10 digits and 26 letters, there's not a ton logic permutations to choose from.
[20:43:50] <pjb> johnjay: one cool thing, is the memory of the 1401: it was designed with hollerith code in mind: 4 bits to store the 10 numeric rows, and 2 bits to store rows 11 and 12 (named A and B), and 1 bit to indicate start of fields Mark bit M, and one parity bit (they used this flaky new core memory), so they had 8-bit memory, but it was actually designed as a base-ten / alphabetic system, not a binary system.
[20:44:28] <johnjay> yeah that's what i was confused about
[20:44:33] <pjb> The mark bit let specify fields of variable length.  So operations such as add, sub, or move, had an implicit loop that worked until it found a M=1 mark bit (so it marked the end of field actually).
[20:44:40] <johnjay> it's not really an "evolution" if it's a different way of rearranging just A-Z
[20:44:53] <johnjay> morse code i mean.

[20:46:06] <pjb> Well, there's a link Morse->Baudot; then there's hollerith (numeric)->holerith (alphabetic)->1401->ebcdic; and then there's ASCII, which was more designed, but taking into account what was learned with ebcdic.
[20:46:39] <pjb> 1401 were great indeed.  And then, the 360 had an 1401 emulator for people to easily upgrade, while keeping their old programs.

[23:21:46] <rdrg109> That's weird because I've even been able to reproduce the bug in Emacs 27.2 at Termux.
[23:22:23] <dieggsy> is there a built-in way to make dired use a different format for buffers (for example start with a space)  ? 
[23:22:31] <dieggsy> short of a hook that renames the buffer
[23:22:53] <jrm> rdrg109: Yes.  Point doesn't move when evaluating (open-line -1) in both 25.2.2 and 28.  I started with emacs -Q in both cases.
[23:22:55] <bpalmer> dieggsy: what is the connection between dired and buffers?
[23:23:07] <dieggsy> i'd be wary of using some hacked in solution as it could mess with operations that interact with dired? unless those use buffer filename associations
[23:23:19] <dieggsy> bpalmer: how do you mean? dired uses buffers to display directories?

[23:25:37] <rdrg109> jrm: It probably is because the bug only exists in 27.2
[23:26:16] <jrm> rdrg109: Maybe.  Let me see if I can find a 27.2 installation.

[23:27:01] <dieggsy> bpalmer: ok. well, maybe i'll just try a hook renaming the buffer
[23:27:02] <bpalmer> rdrg109: I just did (with emacs 27.2) emacs -Q ; in *scratch*, (open-line -1) C-j ; Q to quit the error buffer; and then started typing, and I don't see anything wrong

[23:32:51] <skangas> Still there have been plenty of releases over the years so something must be happening. Including a completely new tool to make PPM-files that became the officially supported one in like 2014
