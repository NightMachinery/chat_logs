[01:42:16] <merced> lol my company just announced that they're removing local admin from everyone
[01:43:45] <Rudde> So if an async function returns when it hits await and just skip the code between the await and the return, what is even the point of the await? Aren't I telling it to await the response of that async function before executing any further?
[01:43:57] <merced> sucks for the helpdesk guy that has to take my admin request call every morning
[01:44:18] <merced> Rudde: yes but the caller of your async method doesn't _have_ to wait
[01:45:39] <Rudde> well the code below the await doesn't really make sense when it's like var foo = await asyncDataCall()
[01:45:56] <GetShwifty> await is a promise

[01:46:07] <Rudde> I want to use that foo below
[01:46:09] <GetShwifty> await is how you fulfil the promise
[01:46:15] <Rudde> before what I want to return is ready

[01:46:36] <GetShwifty> describe what you're actually attempting to accomplish
[01:46:42] <biberu> Rudde: while awaiting the calling thread is free to do something else (if asyncDataCall is actually asynchronous, you can't tell like that)
[01:46:43] <GetShwifty> are you trying to run two things at the same time ?
[01:47:12] <Rudde> No, not really
[01:48:03] <GetShwifty> 99.999% of the timne you want to await an async method
[01:48:06] <GetShwifty> beacuse you care about the result
[01:48:27] <GetShwifty> if you don't await it you just have a promise to execute something that needs to be fulfilled

[04:16:42] <niston> it's a heuristic in the AV, checking if the AV provider has seen the file on other systems. if it can't find an unknown number of other systems having the file, it gets flagged.
[04:17:32] <niston> so basically internal applications get blocked by default, because nobody on the internet is supposed to have them.

[05:02:54] <Ownix> Do I need to store a time zone with a DateTime?
[05:03:20] <Ownix> I have an event StartDate in my DB, and I want to be able to fire notifications off and stuff to the users
[05:04:43] <GetShwifty> These uses for DateTimeOffset values are much more common than those for DateTime values. As a result, consider DateTimeOffset as the default date and time type for application development.
[05:04:44] <GetShwifty> lmao
[05:05:57] <GetShwifty> i believe if you put a TimeZone info in a DAteTime it retains it
[05:06:35] <GetShwifty> you may need to verify  that your datastore backing round trips it, e.g.  i believe though that you might need to use datetimeoffset for it to round trip in SQL Server
[05:07:14] <GetShwifty> i would personally recommend stepping back though and consider storing ALL times in UTC
[05:07:24] <GetShwifty> and tracking TimeZones per user
[05:07:52] <GetShwifty> and generating alerts based upon UTC + TimeZone conversion based upon the individual user you're generating the notification for

[05:25:42] <Ownix> GetShwifty: yeah that was my plan, I thought DateTime and DateTimeOffset in Entity Framework Core just saves as a datetime2 either way?
[05:26:05] <Ownix> If I store as datetime2, I still need to store TimeZone right? I think thats my initial question
[05:26:14] <GetShwifty> i don't make ORM assumptions ;)
[05:26:58] <GetShwifty> my suggestion is you store all datetimes as UTC
[05:27:23] <GetShwifty> because you need to generate your alerts or whatever based off of an individual users timezone
[05:27:28] <Ownix> GetShwifty: but then I need TimeZone stored as well to know where they were when they saved it?
[05:27:32] <Ownix> right
[05:27:50] <GetShwifty> because  what happens if multiple users from differnet timezones are subscribed to the same date date and you stored it in EST
[05:27:56] <GetShwifty> you store it as UTC
[05:28:01] <GetShwifty> and convert to EST or CT or PT, etc
[05:28:07] <GetShwifty> based upon the user you're gnerating the alert for
[05:28:30] <GetShwifty> then the only shitty thing you have to do is worry about if you're global enough to cross different DST changes
[05:28:37] <GetShwifty> that would be subscribed to the same time
[05:29:12] <GetShwifty> e.g. US and India being subscribed to the same event hosted in US, but India has either changed or not changed DST but US has not  or has lol
[05:29:28] <Ownix> Hmm, yeah im not sure how to accomplish this then
[05:29:37] <GetShwifty> if you're not going to be THAT glboal
[05:29:40] <GetShwifty> i wouldn't worry about that scenario lol
[05:29:46] <GetShwifty> (yet)
[05:29:47] <Ownix> Well lets just say USA only
[05:29:50] <GetShwifty> yeah
[05:30:04] <Ownix> Id have to gather up all events for the day, look up the users subscribed, get their timezone from the accounts
[05:30:04] <GetShwifty> so you convert all from a user + timezone to UTC
[05:30:15] <GetShwifty> and store as UTC
[05:30:26] <GetShwifty> then you process PER user's timezone against the UTC
[05:30:43] <Ownix> Okay that makes sense. Gonna need a nightly process or something
[05:30:47] <GetShwifty> yeah
[05:31:00] <GetShwifty> there will bea lot of lifting that you can't do in SQL server because of the per user
[05:31:14] <GetShwifty> and iwould recommend making this VERY DRY/SOLID

[07:02:06] <teegee> when you talk to an external rest api from your library, do you keep the same htmlclient or do you just create one when a call is made?
[07:03:50] <teegee> or depends on how complicated the setup is?
[07:04:50] <GetShwifty> i generally let .net core do what it wants by default on the premise that HOPEFULLY after 10 years of bugs and doing the wrong thing
[07:04:56] <GetShwifty> that they finally have it to the right thing
[07:05:13] <GetShwifty> so unless i need a special htmlclient cause of making modifications to its settings, etc
[07:05:19] <teegee> ah, the answer is in the doc
[07:05:22] <GetShwifty> i just let it inject it at whatever
[07:05:38] <GetShwifty> which i dont know if thats transient,  scoped or  singleton
[07:06:17] <GetShwifty> fme/fmu usually really only matters if you're doing 30+ calls a minute non-stop all day long
[07:06:30] <teegee> HttpClient is intended to be instantiated once and re-used throughout the life of an application.
[07:07:09] <GetShwifty> with the caveat if you make config modifications for a spe cific use case you need a new singleton instance based off of those config modificatoins
[07:07:32] <teegee> that doesn't apply to me
[07:07:38] <GetShwifty> cool
[07:07:48] <GetShwifty> do you plan on stressing it like 30+ clals a minute non-stop for 5-30 minutes?
[07:08:10] <teegee> That could definitely happen
[07:08:34] <GetShwifty> i would definitely have that as one of your "stress' tests just given the history/track record of httpclient :D
[07:08:45] <GetShwifty> and the fact that generally that SPECIFIC scenario usually was the only one that had a problem
[07:09:22] <GetShwifty> not something you need to do regularly, but once you've got it 'working' would do a solid 30-120 / overnight run :D
[07:11:42] <teegee> I'm currently using a 3rd party lib (not for c#) and every now and then some of my GETs don't return fully. Very annoying. I caught it once with wireshark and found a mild sprinkling of RSTs but could only reproduce on a single machine
[07:12:11] <GetShwifty> hah yeah those types of isssues... are fun to diagnose/debug
[07:12:32] <GetShwifty> because it never just reproes instantly . it's always 9,375th network call and above you have a .01% chacne of
[07:12:55] <teegee> of course
[07:13:55] <teegee> on top of that the rest api runs on an embedded system developed in house and they're using a 5 year old mongoose but claim it works
[07:14:10] <GetShwifty> :)

[08:15:56] <GetShwifty> i love the bug that ms somehow introduced in vs
[08:16:19] <GetShwifty> that probably would be impossible to repro to idiots who simply create a new project  with a single class. try something and then instantly state "cant repro
[08:16:33] <GetShwifty> but you copy and paste code (and i assume this is mostly noticeable in huge projects)
[08:16:58] <GetShwifty> quickly select the just copied and pasted text and then hit Control+h to bring up the find and replace dialog
[08:17:25] <GetShwifty> and anywhere from 20-80% of the time depending upon how badly the VS is lagging and how fast you did that it defaults to "document" instead selection
[08:18:05] <GetShwifty> wait x # of seconds and do the EXACT same thing

[12:19:58] <Nasp> Why do people do such stuff
[12:21:23] <OrangePanda> Nasp: maybe the viewmodel is self aware.

[12:22:07] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  Yea i saw
[12:22:40] <Nasp> Do i really need to make an anlalyzer that checks if you have dependencies from a viewmodel to a model
[12:22:44] <Nasp> And reuse viewmodels across
[12:22:55] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: I would recommend ArchUnit for that

[12:23:20] <MatthiasVance> You could do the same with analyzer I think

[13:07:13] <jmer> 10% of what?
[13:07:19] <Nasp> Because that means if it took 10% to make during a week

[13:10:54] <Nasp> I've known for  a while that certain parts of our it systems are nothing but debt and fragile and kinda falling apart
[13:11:00] <Nasp> Like if we can't figure out how to parse datetimes
[13:11:04] <Nasp> Then we are kinda in deep shit right
[13:11:34] <jmer> well... handling dates correctly is harder than it seems on the surface
[13:11:44] <jmer> I don't thnk I've worked anywhere, where dates where handled in a sane manner.
[13:11:51] <jmer> they just work "mostly"
[13:11:52] <ap5> Nope
[13:12:23] <ap5> To do it correctly you need to know what hardware etc it is running on, and the exact formats of everything: and that is hard
[13:13:28] <ap5> Like: setting up a new server, that runs some workloads ... If that system clock is configured badly, your systems will fail _sometimes_ (when the load is offloaded to that new server)

[13:15:05] <Nasp> ap5:  You dont need to know any of that when you only work with dates
[13:18:03] <ap5> Well, if you only work with dates, and make that one mistake of saving the datetime into a database, and another comes along seeing the datetime, and it helps him with his new assignment, checking something that has to do with time, then you better make sure that the time is also correct. Many people, especially people that uses Entity framework, dont tink of data in such way. Luckliy it is becoming much easier working with date
[13:18:03] <ap5> and times becasuse we get a representation of both in the newer versions of .NET
[13:18:38] <ap5> But, as jmer said. Working with datetimes is hard AF

[13:33:05] <jmer> it's called "LocalDb" but it's not related to the SQL Server localdb concept
[13:33:32] <jmer> it's a configuration value that is put in an if statement that if it's set to 1 it attaches an .mdf file and connects to that DB xD

[13:39:06] <Nasp> And why maintain unused code

[13:39:35] <alguien_> Funny how the capitalization convention prevents a C# programmer from using inferred member names :|
[13:39:52] <Nasp> alguien_:  What do you mean?
[13:40:53] <alguien_> Nasp, you could write new { member } (very useful in LINQ), except that would break convention so you would have to write new { Member = member }
[13:41:28] <Nasp> Why is it lower case to begin with?
[13:41:41] <Nasp> Also i would argue it doesn't necessarily break the convention since it's an anon

[18:26:05] <Suchiman> MaNa2k: well 3 servers exist in the box of ASP.NET Core but kestrel is being used by default, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=windows

[18:27:17] <MaNa2k> Suchiman, ah i see i see
[18:27:28] <pandem> but I think I'll use some of the faangs as measurement like that
[18:27:52] <MaNa2k> then we're probably using kestral i think, since we rarely touch those settings
[18:28:02] <MatthiasVance> pandem: Yeah and research what they check for in an engineer :D
[18:40:00] <Suchiman> MaNa2k: depends on which version of ASP.NET Core you're using, IIS InProcess hosting became the default around 3.0 or 3.1 if you're deploying to IIS which you are if you're using windows azure app service
[18:40:35] <Suchiman> MaNa2k: if you're unsure, look into the deployed web.config

[18:55:12] <Diablo-D3> also, is kestrel basically grizzly et al for c#?
[18:55:20] <MatthiasVance> Diablo-D3: I thought it wouldn't be an issue and it would act like the (supported) controller, however I also see (old) stories that it doesn't work

[18:57:25] <Diablo-D3> MatthiasVance: the very stupid way of checking would be RDP into the box from the old windows rdp client
[18:57:31] <Diablo-D3> and then try to (badly) game
[18:57:58] <MatthiasVance> Diablo-D3: Into what box?
[18:58:26] <Diablo-D3> well, any box
[18:58:40] <Diablo-D3> rdp into desktop from laptop, plug wheel into laptop
[18:58:50] <Diablo-D3> see if game on desktop sees the events from the wheel
[18:58:53] <MatthiasVance> But .. I don't have any games on desktop
[18:58:54] <MatthiasVance> Or laptop
[18:58:57] <MatthiasVance> Or anywhere

[19:02:35] <Diablo-D3> its clean for now, you mean
[19:03:50] <MatthiasVance> I am planning to try out Sandboxie again :D
[19:03:58] <MatthiasVance> So that it might stay that way ... a bit more
[19:07:28] <MaNa2k> lol accident at a atomic reactor in sweeden
[19:07:57] <MaNa2k> media is saying "fuel damage
[19:07:57] <MaNa2k> " whatever that means
[19:09:41] <Diablo-D3> given their fuel is angry
[19:09:45] <Diablo-D3> I'd be worried
[19:16:18] <MatthiasVance> Diablo-D3: Regarding clean .. some anti cheat solutions install some nasty kernel drivers
[19:16:33] <Diablo-D3> MatthiasVance: well, they used to
[19:16:40] <Diablo-D3> and then win11 forced VBS on for everyone
[19:16:40] <edcba> well you can't really install games and have something "clean" ?
[19:16:50] <Diablo-D3> hilarious shenanigans ensued.
[19:17:08] <MatthiasVance> Diablo-D3: Well yes but the isolation is turned off when you have an incompatible driver
[19:17:16] <MatthiasVance> Instead of disallowing the driver installation
[19:17:25] <edcba> oh about forcing users, why did my windows forgot to tell me it will update this night ?
[19:17:29] <MatthiasVance> I found that out when I went to turn it on
[19:17:32] <Diablo-D3> yes, but you have to enable installing of said drivers
[19:17:36] <MatthiasVance> Ah sure
[19:17:45] <MatthiasVance> I wasn't clear about the impact of doing so though Diablo-D3 :(
[19:17:54] <MatthiasVance> Also, I am pretty sure I didn't OK a driver itself
[19:18:07] <MatthiasVance> But I guess giving admin OK for the setup is enough?
[19:18:10] <MatthiasVance> That's shitty
[19:18:30] <Diablo-D3> probably should be sent to windows defender as a malware sample.
[19:18:53] <Diablo-D3> microsofts been taking this sort of bullshit seriously
[19:18:57] <MatthiasVance> Now, for the hack of the day .. can I go from DP to HDMI to DVI and will it work? :D
[19:19:05] <MatthiasVance> Diablo-D3: It's PUBG, pretty popular game
[19:19:14] <Diablo-D3> microsoft doesnt give a shit about pubg.
[19:19:20] <MatthiasVance> xD
[19:19:25] <MatthiasVance> Neither do I!
[19:19:43] <Diablo-D3> microsoft already broke at least one game that injected malware with VBS
[19:19:46] <MatthiasVance> Also, only controllers are supported in Xbox Cloud Gaming :(
[19:20:03] <MatthiasVance> I was getting hyped playing this racing game lol
[19:20:04] <Diablo-D3> any game that has anticheat and had "fixed win11" in their changelogs got bit by it
[19:20:08] <MatthiasVance> :D

[19:20:10] <Diablo-D3> theres several big name games that got it.

[19:34:43] <GetShwifty> when everybody is on Pluton and Windows 11
[19:34:51] <Diablo-D3> Pluton wont fix anything
[19:34:55] <GetShwifty> game publishers will have the ultimate control to lock people out
[19:34:58] <GetShwifty> oh
[19:35:04] <GetShwifty> Pluton will fix a bunchof shit
[19:35:08] <Diablo-D3> and its basically doa if AMD doesn't backport it to currently shipping AGESAs.
[19:35:16] <GetShwifty> ms doesn't care
[19:35:21] <GetShwifty> amd and intel are committed to it for FUTURE chips
[19:35:29] <Diablo-D3> yes, but nobody is buying future chips
[19:35:40] <Diablo-D3> amd "fucked up" by making zen 2 and 3 too fucking strong.
[19:35:40] <GetShwifty> ms has been around for almost 50 yearS?
[19:35:45] <GetShwifty> uhh
[19:35:45] <GetShwifty> no
[19:35:47] <GetShwifty> zen2 is not strong
[19:35:56] <GetShwifty> most people i know got rid of their zen 2 for zen 3 lol
[19:36:09] <GetShwifty> zen 3 might be better but if people yhave a bit of spare money they're buying new amd
[19:36:16] <Diablo-D3> I know a few people that did... only because they wanted a single CCX machine.
[19:36:19] <GetShwifty> but i8t doesnt matter MS is playing the LONG game
[19:36:39] <GetShwifty> and pluton + windows 11 will be DRM interested companies wet dreams
[19:36:53] <GetShwifty> and they will have to do fewer 'hacks' because they can do more stuff inside the hidden vm
[19:37:02] <Diablo-D3> unfortunately, not really
[19:37:09] <Diablo-D3> it'd put the DRM scammers out of business
[19:37:17] <Diablo-D3> they'd have to use Microsoft's solution or no solution at all.
[19:37:17] <GetShwifty> ?
[19:37:29] <GetShwifty> yeah but ms basically built this solution for them lol
[19:37:29] <GetShwifty> so
[19:37:36] <GetShwifty> AND it will be MORE effective than their shit
[19:37:36] <GetShwifty> so
[19:37:40] <Diablo-D3> no, in the games industry, DRM is a huge scam

[19:37:53] <Diablo-D3> they never do
[19:37:53] <GetShwifty> i mean yeah but :p everything in life is a scam from one point of view
[19:37:56] <Diablo-D3> yet they get paid
[19:37:59] *** Miles is now known as Miles8of9
[19:38:02] <GetShwifty> ehh they've gotten a lot bet ter
[19:38:14] <GetShwifty> it's a lot more difficult (for various reasons) to pirate games
[19:38:29] <Diablo-D3> the best DRM I've seen in the past 5 years took a month to crack.... on a game nobody gave a shit about anyways, they cracked it merely as a matter of pirate pride
[19:38:38] <GetShwifty> so i think even though there are WAYYY more gamers today than there were 5-10 years ago , the % of people ACTUIALLy pirating games
[19:38:39] <GetShwifty> is down
[19:39:00] <Diablo-D3> piracy is down because of steam
[19:39:03] <GetShwifty> and i think when everybody can be guaranteed to be on Pluton / W11 and all of the game devs have gotten onboard
[19:39:05] <Diablo-D3> games on steam generally do not use drm.
[19:39:45] <GetShwifty> yeah i'm specifically referring to AAA - the shit that do drm
[19:39:51] <Diablo-D3> also, Ive heard steam may be cracking down on drm as well
[19:40:00] <Diablo-D3> drm does not, and has never, benefited customers.
[19:40:10] <GetShwifty> that's not waht the discussion is about
[19:40:21] <GetShwifty> and afaik Steam doesn't discriminate against DRM
[19:40:25] <GetShwifty> theres plenty of DRM
[19:40:26] <Diablo-D3> it doesnt *currently*.
[19:40:29] <Diablo-D3> well, it partially does
[19:40:31] <GetShwifty> the only thing steam does is it lets you know
[19:40:34] <Diablo-D3> certain drms arent allowed on steam
[19:40:36] <GetShwifty> "this has 3rd party drm"
[19:40:54] <GetShwifty> but i think the DRM landscape will be a lot idfferent in 5 years
[19:40:57] <Diablo-D3> major studios tried to fight steam on the 3rd party drm warning
[19:41:02] <Diablo-D3> guess what valve said
[19:41:05] <GetShwifty> suck it
[19:41:05] <GetShwifty> lol
[19:41:08] <Diablo-D3> yup
[19:41:15] <Diablo-D3> "there are other stores for PC games, you're welcome to use them"
[19:41:21] <Diablo-D3> notice nobody quit.
[19:41:54] <Diablo-D3> but yeah, generally, DRM is malware, and several DRM vendors already had to patch their shit to work on Win11
[19:42:19] <Diablo-D3> its only a matter of time before either steam forces the removal of DRM entirely, or microsoft forces them to use their solution (if its ever adopted, that is)
[19:42:34] <GetShwifty> i think the true answer will be in between
[19:42:41] <GetShwifty> ms isn't going to 'push' anybody to use anything
[19:42:53] <GetShwifty> its just offering it as a 'great solution that is going to be next to impossible to hack'
[19:42:55] <Diablo-D3> ms is going to "remove security holes used by state sponsored actors"
[19:43:06] <GetShwifty> which to DRM makers i believe will be very tempting
[19:43:31] <GetShwifty> i personally believe that Pluton was quite possibly made with a lot of suggestions/help from people relatedto MPAA/RIAA/Software DRMing industry
[19:43:40] <Diablo-D3> not exactly
[19:43:46] <GetShwifty> very similar to how a lot of the other DRM / ETC friendly stuff that showed up in windows 8-10
[19:43:50] <Diablo-D3> it was made with a lot of suggestions by security experts.
[19:43:53] <GetShwifty> 3as done based on recommendations
[19:43:59] <GetShwifty> by RIAA/MPAA lol
[19:44:06] <Diablo-D3> nobody cares about the RIAA or MPAA
[19:44:12] <GetShwifty> ms did
[19:44:16] <Diablo-D3> ms "did"
[19:44:20] <GetShwifty> and they still do
[19:44:38] <Diablo-D3> MS also removed the malware that sony installed on everyone's computer via music CDs
[19:44:59] <GetShwifty> that is completely and utterly unrelated to
[19:45:16] <Diablo-D3> not unrelated, was a botched form of DRM
[19:45:23] <GetShwifty> yeah
[19:45:32] <GetShwifty> even sony basically asked ms to remove after the backlash
[19:45:34] <Diablo-D3> sony is one of the biggest RIAA members
[19:45:48] <GetShwifty> because ms was the only person that could remove it and save them from a killer lawsuit
[19:45:48] <GetShwifty> lol
[19:46:00] <Diablo-D3> yup, but notice the issue here
[19:46:11] <Diablo-D3> DRM is only malware, and should always result in a "killer lawsuit"
[19:46:20] <Diablo-D3> sony poked a bear that cannot be put back to sleep
[19:46:56] <GetShwifty> we can reconvene in 5-7 years :D
[19:47:04] <GetShwifty> i have a feeling i will be closer to right than you :-p
[19:47:46] <Diablo-D3> dunno, theres a bigger issue that the government seems to be getting their nose into lately
[19:48:10] <Diablo-D3> the fact that china has internally shut their games industry down, yet chinese companies keep making non-trivial investments into large US and EU studios
[19:48:19] <Diablo-D3> and one of the big DRM vendors is chinese-owned
[19:49:34] <Diablo-D3> so Im pretty sure we're going to end up with a future where all the current DRM solutions were banished as malware vectors, and everyones just going to have to live with that

[20:10:44] <GetShwifty> and age and time has given me greater perspective to see not only where the world always goes to, but get a better understanding of WHY
[20:11:38] <GetShwifty> and for the most part, the world/society as a whole is WAY WAY WAY more comfortable with DRM today, than it was 10 years ago, primarily beacuse the mass sheeple now make up the majority of the gamers instead of the people that repreresented a signfiicant portion of the gaming community  10 years ago
[20:12:09] <GetShwifty> and  also people are  more instant gratification today than they were 10+ years ago
[20:12:34] <GetShwifty> and i believe BOTH of those trends are going to only really gradually  increase in the future

[20:18:17] <GetShwifty> and remember not all things companies do is "for profit' lmao
[20:20:49] <DevJohnC> DRM to the point that you make sure your product isn't nominally available for free is worthwhile, the root kits that take over your system and always-on bullshit is a scourge on the industry
[20:21:15] <Diablo-D3> DevJohnC: yup, and companies literally got pissed Microsoft broke their shit
[20:21:24] <Diablo-D3> its like, bro, you cant just hack people's shit because you're an idiot

[20:26:09] <Diablo-D3> GetShwifty: reverse
[20:26:26] <Diablo-D3> game is breaking on win11 because malware is being further mitigated against
[20:26:41] <Diablo-D3> its also why a few big games broke when vbs got enabled on win10
[20:26:48] <Diablo-D3> you cant pull that shit here

[21:06:41] <Xenoprimate> So it's like [Override] in C#

[21:17:49] <Suchiman> which reminds me of an angry blog posts about annotations that got an ark of attempts including yelling out at one point "NULL IS NOT A CONSTANT???"
[21:18:05] <jonp> Xenoprimate: er, wait, what? Java Annotations certainly CAN be on the same line as what they're annotating
[21:18:20] <Xenoprimate> jonp fair
[21:18:22] <jonp> `@Override public String toString()` is valid
[21:18:26] <Xenoprimate> It's been years since I did Java
[21:18:55] <Xenoprimate> Suchiman, what? xP
[21:19:07] <Suchiman> Xenoprimate: null is not a constant in java
[21:19:17] <Suchiman> Xenoprimate: and parameters to annotations (attributes) must be constant
[21:19:22] <Xenoprimate> Ohhhh
[21:19:24] <Xenoprimate> Ohhhh godddd
[21:19:26] <Suchiman> so @FuckingHell(string = null) is error
[21:19:34] <Xenoprimate> Yeah I think I vaguely remember that now
[21:20:38] <merced> hahahaha
[21:20:45] <merced> isnt java fun
[21:20:48] <Xenoprimate> Mind you I think C# constants could be 10000 times better too
[21:21:10] <Xenoprimate> Why can I write const double Whatever = 100d; but not wrap that in a struct with a single readonly double field and declare THAT a constant
[21:21:30] <ASUS> I think C# in a nutshell is the verbosity of Java combined with the insanity of C++.
[21:21:49] <Xenoprimate> Some might say the power of C++ with the simplicity of Java ;)
[21:22:00] <jonp> Xenoprimate: because `decimal` isn't a "core" CLR type; `double` is
[21:22:12] <Xenoprimate> jonp, I never mentioned decimal!
[21:22:21] <jonp> never mind, misread
[21:22:26] <Xenoprimate> I figured haha
[21:22:28] <Suchiman> ASUS: C# is java without the mistakes :P
[21:22:34] <jonp> Suchiman: *fewer* mistakes
[21:22:36] <jonp> C# still has some
[21:23:04] <jonp> many of which could have been avoided if C# 1 had generics, but that was never gonna happen
[21:23:04] <merced> and to be fair, project lombok annotation processor fixed most of the annoying things for me personally
[21:23:12] <Suchiman> right, C# thought covariant arrays is definitively a feature they have to copy from java
[21:23:27] <merced> java generics are puke
[21:23:29] <Xenoprimate> jonp, at least no more-modern language would ever make that mistake again and release v1 without generics... >.>
[21:23:39] <jonp> uh… Golang?
[21:23:45] <Xenoprimate> Exactly jonp, exactly
[21:23:47] <jonp> Zig?
[21:23:47] <Suchiman> hahahaha
[21:24:15] <jonp> i "love" how the Golang generics proposal reminds me of VB.NET
[21:24:17] <Xenoprimate> merced type erasure sucks donkey dick but I do miss MyWhatever<? extends Something>
[21:24:36] <jonp> Xenoprimate: you can actually do that; it just requires "a layer of indirection"
[21:24:41] <Xenoprimate> I know
[21:24:47] <Xenoprimate> But it's better in Java
[21:24:55] <jonp> <? super Something> i don't think is expressable
[21:25:04] <merced> yea ? extends * is neat
[21:25:15] <merced> type erasure is easy enough to deal with if you have to, with reflection
[21:26:03] <Suchiman> isn't that the same as MyWhatever<T> where T : Something
[21:26:26] <merced> sorta, but its legal any place you define a generic type
[21:26:57] <merced> like i think you can do new List<? extends Block>()
[21:27:02] <merced> arraylist
[21:27:09] <merced> gets me every time
[21:27:21] <jonp> not sure how that's really better than `new List<Block>`
[21:27:35] <jonp> of course you can add subclasses
[21:27:53] <merced> there's stupid cases where that won't work in java iirc
[21:28:17] <merced> but for the most part i just stay away from generics unless i really need them
[21:29:09] <merced> my favorite change tho in java has to be allowing keyword `var`

[22:20:01] <MichaelLong> just do less work, wonder why this is never an option
[22:20:23] <GetShwifty> because less work generally doesn't yield in more results in this scenario lol
[22:20:33] <brianonymous> that happens by default.. code 10 lines.. talk for an hour.. delete those 10 lines.. talk for 20mins..
[22:20:43] <MichaelLong> GetShwifty, that's the point?
[22:20:59] <GetShwifty> if you can keep a job / keep being promoted / keep growing / advancing, sure
[22:21:03] <GetShwifty> then if that works for you, yes
[22:21:25] <GetShwifty> typically where i live and work.. that results in being shit canned, not growing, not keeping your clients, not advancing
[22:22:23] <MichaelLong> GetShwifty, the first one, ok this is important but "keep being promoted"? I'm actively working against it, and the challenge is to still earn more money.
[22:23:20] <MichaelLong> and btw. there are soo, soo many people that just don't want to grow or advance. that's sometimes annoying to me and hard to understand.
