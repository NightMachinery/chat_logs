[13:28:46] <cpach> i want to use Bash to iterate over a bunch of data files in a nested directory structure.
[13:28:50] <cpach> i tried this solution: https://paste.debian.net/1227768
[13:28:59] <cpach> however, that will break if any filename contains a space.
[13:29:17] <cpach> and the data is user-controlled, so i would like to be able to work on files that have spaces in their name

[15:13:59] <siwica> We are currently developping a firmware for an embedded device and consider using a GPL3 licenced protocol stack in one of the programs to be run on the device. Are we then to release the entire firmware under GPL3 or would releasing only the respective program under GPL3 suffice? It's not entirely clear to me, how the term "work" in GPL3 is exactly defined?
[15:14:18] <siwica> *the required
[15:14:54] <GyrosGeier> it kind of depends on the way it is linked
[15:15:04] <GyrosGeier> (or not linked)
[15:15:56] <GyrosGeier> basically, if the protocol stack and your code form a big conglomerate in a single address space, then the GPL prohibits distribution under incompatible licenses
[15:16:51] <siwica> The program in question would be statically linked against the protocol stack. It does, however, communicate with other programs over Linux Domain sockets (or possibly other methods of IPC).
[15:17:21] <GyrosGeier> then the program is a derived work
[15:17:47] <siwica> But not the entire firmware (consisting of multiple programs)?
[15:17:51] <GyrosGeier> indeed
[15:18:16] <labrador> siwica, its kinda hard to know wether a work is ultimately a 'derivative work' or not
[15:18:31] <siwica> Would packaging the respective program with other programs in one single image make the entire firmware a "derived work"? 
[15:18:42] <GyrosGeier> generally, the way the nVidia drivers are handled is a good example
[15:18:54] <labrador> GyrosGeier, thats a loophole yes
[15:19:12] <GyrosGeier> there are stub drivers that are GPL, and the real drivers are proprietary
[15:19:23] <labrador> A gpled shim loads proprietary drivers
[15:19:50] <GyrosGeier> this generally makes people really angry because support for the proprietary code is shite, and you can't even fix simple problems yourself
[15:20:19] <labrador> GyrosGeier, it also makes people angry that that black box is running in ring 0
[15:20:30] <GyrosGeier> that too
[15:20:46] <GyrosGeier> although they are reducing it with each new hardware revision
[15:21:08] <siwica> Another question: When selling a GPL3 based program, is one required to deliver the source code simultaneously or does delivering it upon request suffice?
[15:21:20] <labrador> siwica, delivering upon request
[15:21:31] <GyrosGeier> on request, but the offer needs to be good for three years
[15:21:38] <GyrosGeier> (IIRC)
[15:21:41] <labrador> But it has a lot of caveats,so don't think you can loop hole it easily
[15:21:50] <GyrosGeier> yes
[15:21:55] <bj52> it must be good as long as you are still distributing it
[15:22:16] <GyrosGeier> basically, there are thirty-plus years of people trying to find loopholes
[15:22:19] *** Joins: u0_a193 (~u0_a193@200.87.20.198)
[15:22:26] <GyrosGeier> bj52, yes, plus three years
[15:22:33] <bj52> yep
[15:22:40] <GyrosGeier> and it must be the version that matches the binary
[15:22:42] <labrador> GyrosGeier, and hey tivo found one
[15:23:01] <GyrosGeier> so you need an archive of old versions
[15:23:22] <siwica> Ok, I see. 
[15:23:31] <siwica> Well, for know I am just in the process of understanding the GPL3. Not so much looking for loopholes.
[15:24:00] <GyrosGeier> the general idea is "we're building a free software commons. People can contribute to it, but not take without giving back."
[15:24:31] <labrador> siwica, eh its pretty simple otherwise. Its essence is that if you change stuff,it must be released back if distributed.
[15:24:42] <GyrosGeier> even if unchanged
[15:24:45] <labrador> yes
[15:24:58] <siwica> GyrosGeier: Sure! I definitely understand (and support) this spirit.
[15:25:12] <labrador> The lgpl weakens it by allowing addition into proprietary programs
[15:25:20] <labrador> But you still need to send your changes
[15:25:35] <bj52> I'd say you can link to 3rd party copies if you don't make any changes, but problem is that if that copy is gone, you are in violation of the GPL license
[15:25:36] <GyrosGeier> also, closing the Tivo loophole means that users need a way to install their own firmware that they built from sources
[15:25:36] <siwica> We are developping IOT devices for industry applications. So obviously we don't want to open-source the entire firmware.
[15:26:01] <bj52> 3rd party code repositories are under no obligation to help you comply with the license
[15:26:05] <labrador> The agpl strengthens it by adding network service users in 'distribution'
[15:26:17] <Mc> "obviously" ?
[15:26:26] <GyrosGeier> this
[15:26:39] <labrador> Mc, eh the stuff siwica makes is pretty much always black boxes
[15:26:40] <labrador> Always
[15:27:05] <labrador> I don't know why these companies protect these so much,but they do
[15:27:05] <GyrosGeier> if you have another unique selling point beyond the firmware, then having open firmware could be a plus
[15:27:43] <labrador> Anyway the point is siwica you need to ask your companies' lawyers before you actually do that
[15:27:52] <labrador> And they will deny
[15:28:38] <elshid_> Absolutely. Open Firmware is a big plus!
[15:28:46] <siwica> We are also developping the hardware and the surrounding infrastructure, so that's a unique selling point.
[15:28:49] <GyrosGeier> like, if I'm tasked with rolling out IoT infrastructure in an office building, I will have to ask about whether the entire network is dependent on an external entity
[15:29:08] <labrador> siwica, who is 'we',is it a big company?
[15:29:12] <labrador> or a small one
[15:29:20] <siwica> ~35 people. Small company.

[15:29:38] <labrador> siwica, then there's a chance you could actually get that gpl code in
[15:29:40] <siwica> With no company lawyers :)
[15:29:41] <GyrosGeier> if I put your hardware in, and you stop supporting it in ten years, do I need to rip it out, or can I buy support somewhere else?
[15:29:44] <labrador> nice

[15:30:27] <siwica> Got a meeting. Will reply in ~15 min probably.
[15:30:33] <elshid_> @siwica I would consult a lawyer.
[15:30:33] <GyrosGeier> hmm
[15:30:43] <GyrosGeier> good point, it's lunchtime here as well
[15:30:50] <labrador> Well yes elshid_ a lawyer is a good idea
[15:30:55] <labrador> Its a long document
[15:32:05] <elshid_> Anither problem is the jurisdiction, as the GPL is interpreted differently around the world.

[16:28:20] <siwica> I wonder what the practial consequences of releasing the entire firmware for an embedded device under GPL3 would be. Apart from ethical ideals I am not sure it would be a net plus for a company across all dimensions.

[20:50:10] <snale> which license does the GNU project recommend for... text? As in, fiction, or non-fiction?

[20:55:51] <bandali> tho these days i gravitate more towards cc0 and putting things into the public domain

[20:56:00] <bandali> (for non-software works)
[20:56:09] <snale> Yeah, that's why I'm asking. :s
[20:57:04] <snale> To be clear, I want to build up a hub for my writing circle where people can freely publish their fiction and non-fiction works. As opposed to bigger projects like fanfiction dot net or AO3, I will require users to set a license and only give various free choices (to encourage good licensing practices)
[20:57:34] <snale> I was wondering which licenses I could offer; so far, I am at CC0, CC-BY-SA, and FAL.
[20:57:49] <snale> I don't think the GFDL works for fiction or anything other than docs.
[20:58:05] *** Quits: Nios34 (~Nios34@114-38-5-132.dynamic-ip.hinet.net) (Remote host closed the connection)
[20:58:18] <yrk> snale: gplv3 is fine for that. I publish my own writing under that license.
[20:58:36] <snale> Since the GPL refers to "source code" according to the licenses list, I think it might be a tad bit wonky publishing text under that?
[20:58:53] <snale> I am going off of the GNU licenses list and it says as long as the "source code" of the work is clear it should be fine
[20:59:01] <snale> it eludes me what a source code would be in... text
[20:59:14] <yrk> snale: not really no.

[20:59:49] <yrk> snale: first, a work can be its own source. uncompiled (and uncompilable) code can be under gplv3, and so can an image
[21:00:15] <snale> Hmmm
[21:00:20] <snale> Fair, I get that
[21:00:25] <yrk> snale: but gplv3 ensures that if someone were to convery your work to latex, or html, or similar, then the source used to generate your work would accompany the result
[21:00:28] <snale> I think I will put GPLv3 as another choice
[21:00:36] <snale> thank you!

[21:03:16] <jxself> And maybe the HTML was made from latex or something.
[21:03:30] <yrk> snale: not the same thing. for a generated page (say with, heaven forfend, php) the browser will let you get the source for the _generated page_ but not the source for the php which produced the generated page
[21:04:39] <snale> Oh you're right, I have been spending too much time in the (X)HTML-only internet
