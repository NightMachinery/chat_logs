[03:01:35] <John_Ivan> anyone have any idea why a call to Zip::File::open() tells me a NameError with "uninitialized constant Zip::File"? I have require 'zip' and it is detected.
[03:15:13] <havenwood> John_Ivan: Just to sanity check, also returns false with?: require 'zip/file'
[03:18:20] <weaksauce> John_Ivan which version of rubyzip are you using?
[03:19:20] <weaksauce> and are you doing it in the context of a bundle exec?
[03:26:50] <weaksauce> though it would have to be really old and the zip would fail

[05:19:27] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, not rubyzip. just 'zip'
[05:19:47] <John_Ivan> havenwood, the lib loads correctly.
[05:19:56] <weaksauce> John_Ivan which gem did you install?
[05:20:07] <weaksauce> because require 'zip' is rubyzip
[05:22:00] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, `gem install zip` - this one here - https://rubygems.org/gems/zip/versions/2.0.2
[05:22:05] <John_Ivan> "
[05:22:05] <John_Ivan> zip is a Ruby library for reading and writing Zip files. Unlike the official rubyzip, zip is compatible with Ruby 1.9.1.
[05:22:05] <John_Ivan> "
[05:22:21] <John_Ivan> sorry. that \r\n went out of wack.
[05:23:19] <weaksauce> that project maintainer bailed on it
[05:23:32] <John_Ivan> oh
[05:23:36] <weaksauce> is this greenfield or are you trying to get something to work?
[05:23:52] <John_Ivan> who is greenfield
[05:24:03] <weaksauce> like... a new project
[05:24:27] <John_Ivan> oh. well. I'm not new to software engineering. I am new to ruby. as a little test, I am writing a script that's meant to read .rar files.
[05:24:34] <weaksauce> ah
[05:24:36] <John_Ivan> and print out to console it's contents.
[05:24:47] <weaksauce> yeah greenfield stuff... i'd probably use rubyzip
[05:24:54] <John_Ivan> I'll do that then.
[05:25:12] <weaksauce> https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip
[05:25:34] <John_Ivan> not familiar with the term greenfield. I know greenhorn though :)
[05:26:51] <weaksauce> they call it greenfield because the project is on an open green field and there is nothing in the way already built 
[05:27:08] <weaksauce> :)
[05:27:20] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, neat.
[05:27:33] <John_Ivan> "Zip end of central directory signature not found (Zip::Error)"
[05:27:41] <John_Ivan> I'm guessing rubyzip doesn't handle .rar files.
[05:27:50] <weaksauce> oh rar hmm
[05:28:05] <John_Ivan> though I could've sworn the last stackoverflow question mentioned that any zip gem should handle rar as well
[05:28:18] <John_Ivan> last so question I've read*
[05:29:42] <John_Ivan> "ffi-libarchive provides a gem-based solution. It works for rar files even though they don't specifically mention it (see issue #151). Add this to your application's Gemfile:"
[05:29:47] <John_Ivan> time to test that.
[05:31:11] <weaksauce> i don't know if there is a general un-raring thing 
[05:32:22] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, if worst comes to worst, I'll just call the rar-cli directly as a new process.
[05:33:02] <weaksauce> yeah that's simple enough 
[05:33:04] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, it seems ffi-libarchive has the same issue as Zip. "uninitialized constant Archive (NameError)" for Archive::EXTRACT_PERM
[05:33:24] * John_Ivan dissapoint
[05:33:38] <John_Ivan> https://github.com/chef/ffi-libarchive
[05:33:52] *** Quits: reset (~reset@user/reset) (Quit: reset)
[05:34:08] <weaksauce> do you have libarchive installed
[05:34:36] <John_Ivan> the binary? nope. just installed the gem. I'm not running a *nix machine.
[05:34:53] <weaksauce> it's a FFI to that binary
[05:35:04] <John_Ivan> ah
[05:35:05] <weaksauce> which is "foreign function interface" 
[05:35:17] <weaksauce> so it calls stuff from ruby into the C/etc world
[05:35:22] <John_Ivan> Understood. *slaps his own face*
[05:35:29] <John_Ivan> yeah. makes sense.
[05:36:08] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, but that aside, I'd expect it to throw a runtime error as opposed to a syntax/interpreter error, no?
[05:36:17] <John_Ivan> what is an uninitialized constant?
[05:36:27] <weaksauce> post the full stack trace in a gist or something 
[05:36:33] <weaksauce> and i can tell you more
[05:36:46] <weaksauce> just means that something is not defined 
[05:37:18] <weaksauce> could be that it failed to bind correctly and thus didn't create that constant (uppercase things in ruby that are generally classes or values)
[05:37:39] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, https://pastebin.com/dCR48Egw
[05:38:02] <weaksauce> maybe gist your code too
[05:38:16] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, it's the one in the github repo I like here - https://github.com/chef/ffi-libarchive
[05:38:24] <John_Ivan> the one for extraction. those 3-4 lines.
[05:38:44] <John_Ivan> well. more like 6.
[05:38:46] <weaksauce> you need to require that gem
[05:38:48] <weaksauce> but yeah
[05:39:01] <weaksauce> if it wasn't required then it can't initialize itself
[05:39:41] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, ok. yeah. that did it.
[05:40:09] <John_Ivan> and of course, can't open archive.dll, because we spoke about that.
[05:40:10] <John_Ivan> awesome.
[05:40:23] <John_Ivan> at least now I know what's wrong.
[05:40:28] <weaksauce> yeah, windows is a gong show wrt ruby
[05:40:50] <weaksauce> i'd think you would want to install WSL
[05:40:54] <weaksauce> or whatever it is
[05:41:07] <John_Ivan> I have a linux vm with seamless integration so I have access.
[05:41:13] <John_Ivan> but I need this running on windows.
[05:42:16] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, anyway, so an uninitialized constant means something isn't defined. ok. got it. that was.... confusing.
[05:42:29] <John_Ivan> I'll keep that in mind next time I forget to require something.
[05:42:52] <weaksauce> you can try https://github.com/aileron/unrar
[05:43:00] <weaksauce> that's just a simple rb file
[05:43:29] <weaksauce> just require "./unrar.rb" or whatever it is named in the same directory your script is on
[05:44:03] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, I will try that. my concern right now is however less to achieve my archiving goals, as much as it is to understand ruby.

[05:44:31] <John_Ivan> C.
[05:44:37] <weaksauce> well fileutils are useful
[05:45:24] <John_Ivan> I've noted that class, yeah. also, I've noticed there's no socket class. but `File` has a socket? method which means, I assume, that files will be treated as sockets, alongside the Io class.
[05:45:44] <John_Ivan> very unixy
[05:46:50] <John_Ivan> anyway, I'd like to make a list if you don't mind
[05:46:57] <weaksauce> https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.7.2/libdoc/socket/rdoc/index.html
[05:47:03] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, popular gems people use or have that "fill/complement" the std-lib
[05:47:17] <weaksauce> socket is part of the stdlib
[05:47:40] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, *slaps his own face* - I forgot to mention I'm with the ruby 2.5 docs
[05:47:53] *** Joins: huma (~huma@202.44.216.123)
[05:47:54] <John_Ivan> it doesn't have these classes there.
[05:48:14] <weaksauce> i'm sure it's been in ruby for eons :)
[05:48:16] <weaksauce> https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.5.0/libdoc/socket/rdoc/index.html
[05:48:27] <weaksauce> they have core and stdlib
[05:48:31] <weaksauce> split apart
[05:48:47] <weaksauce> net/http is more high level than socket
[05:48:48] <John_Ivan> eh? what's the difference
[05:48:55] <John_Ivan> between core and stdlib
[05:49:14] <weaksauce> core is the essentials like enumerable, array, hash
[05:50:09] <John_Ivan> ah. ok. I see. damn. I missed this completely. the stdlib page.
[05:50:14] <John_Ivan> I was looking only at core
[05:50:16] <weaksauce> i guess stuff that you'd need to make any program
[05:50:24] <weaksauce> the extra stuff like csv is out that way
[05:50:44] <John_Ivan> ok this makes a lot of sense now
[05:51:21] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, thanks for that, saved me a lot of trouble. now then, as I said, I'm trying to make a list of popular gems to complement the core/stdlib. anything that comes to mind?
[05:51:27] <weaksauce> the stdlib is still very used but not always
[05:52:16] <weaksauce> rake/minitest or rspec/bundler
[05:52:17] <weaksauce> rails/thor
[05:52:33] <weaksauce> set is useful sometimes
[05:52:55] <weaksauce> time is generally the one you want to use instead of Date or datetime
[05:53:06] <weaksauce> open3
[05:53:12] <weaksauce> net/http
[05:53:49] <John_Ivan> cheers
[05:54:04] <weaksauce> there's a ton really
[05:54:15] <weaksauce> Dir and File are useful
[05:54:31] <weaksauce> as are fileutils for copy/rename/remove etc
[05:55:04] <weaksauce> spend some time learning enumerable as that is hands down the most important thing in ruby
[05:55:23] <weaksauce> map/reduce/select/reject/etc
[05:55:25] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, sounds like iterator in C++.
[05:55:44] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, yeah, these are in stdlib. I was thinking, more like, external gems.
[05:55:50] <John_Ivan> stdlib/core*
[05:55:54] <weaksauce> ah
[05:56:06] <weaksauce> awesomeruby is something worth a browse

[05:57:45] * John_Ivan tips hat
[05:57:51] <weaksauce> :)
[05:58:44] <weaksauce> metasploit is fun
[05:59:50] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, I'm sure it is (grins)
[06:01:31] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, ok. nice. now to start actually understanding the syntax.
[06:01:33] <John_Ivan> by the way
[06:02:00] <weaksauce> hands down the best book on breaking you from your C chains is eloquent ruby
[06:02:04] <weaksauce> great book
[06:02:32] <weaksauce> teaches the ruby way
[06:02:34] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, before ending up in ruby from C, I was guided to python. I left after 2 days.
[06:02:54] <weaksauce> haha i don't care for python
[06:03:08] <John_Ivan> I can't stand python. ruby on the other hand, I thought had a more sane syntax
[06:03:37] <weaksauce> oh the syntax can get ugly sometimes but it's wonderful 
[06:03:45] <weaksauce> fun to program in
[06:04:06] <John_Ivan> that's what I like to hear :D
[06:04:46] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, https://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-Ruby-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0321584104
[06:04:47] <John_Ivan> this/
[06:05:11] <weaksauce> yeah that one
[06:05:32] <weaksauce> probably the only programming book i have read cover to cover
[06:06:29] <John_Ivan> I take it you came from a C background before too huh?
[06:08:34] <weaksauce> yeah
[06:08:53] <weaksauce> way before the internet i read teach yourself c in 24 hours
[06:09:15] <weaksauce> actually paid for a compiler too
[06:09:49] <weaksauce> i think it was borland c++
[06:10:34] <John_Ivan> ah. that's a lot longer before than me
[06:10:56] <John_Ivan> I started with MSVC 6.0 - writing winAPI code
[06:11:11] <weaksauce> ah fun
[06:11:25] <weaksauce> i started on an apple iie doing basic
[06:11:31] <John_Ivan> after much `bliss` (though now it kinda is), I was then introduced to C++, and later C++.net with the CLR
[06:11:33] <weaksauce> typing from magazines 
[06:11:52] <John_Ivan> oh cool
[06:12:02] <weaksauce> .net is nice
[06:12:11] <weaksauce> i did some c# in it
[06:12:24] <John_Ivan> .NET in any other language that isn't C++ is indeed nice.
[06:12:47] <John_Ivan> the syntax is wack and the managed/unmanaged conversions is a bit of an ugly procedure
[06:13:09] <weaksauce> yeah i bet
[06:14:45] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, a little over 40 I presume? I'm just entering my 30s.
[06:15:12] <John_Ivan> you're getting graybeard. neat position to be in. just sucks age wise.
[06:15:25] <John_Ivan> I have a decade until I reach that level
[06:15:40] <weaksauce> hah yeah
[06:15:52] <weaksauce> a few gray hairs but i look pretty young
[06:16:17] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, graymatter ;)
[06:16:55] <John_Ivan> thanks for the book btw. I'll see to reading it.
[06:17:09] <weaksauce> np enjoy :)
[06:17:11] <John_Ivan> I hope ruby will be the language I'll settle for when it comes to VHLL
[06:17:25] <John_Ivan> because I really. really dislike python or javascript hehe
[06:17:41] <weaksauce> yeah those are not my favorites

[16:37:10] <Guest74> Hi everyone! Anyone here that could help me with finding the memory location of a ruby object? Before 2.7, this was easy with object_id, but this changed
[16:37:44] <Guest74> `FFI::Pointer.new(object_id * 2)` works for ruby 2.6 but not for 2.7+

[19:56:35] <entropie> Hey. My gentoo machines updated ssh to openssh-8.8_p1-r4 and now capistrano asks for a passwords when doing remote stuff. Any ideas?
[20:00:32] <adam12> entropie: It doesnt' ask for a password when not using capistrano? ie. just `ssh`?
[20:01:22] <entropie> adam12: yes, it works fine without capistrano. I have set every host I use in my ~/.ssh/config
[20:01:31] <entropie> It worked fine before the update
[20:02:37] <adam12> entropie: which version of net-ssh?
[20:02:38] <leah2> does capistrano force some old ciphers or something so the key doesnt get accepted?
[20:03:09] <adam12> entropie: and the gentoo machines are the client or the remote?
[20:03:17] <entropie> adam12:  net-ssh (6.1.0)
[20:03:46] <leah2> https://github.com/net-ssh/net-ssh/issues/836
[20:05:35] <leah2> no release yet :^)
[20:06:02] <entropie> leah2: A i have looked at the changelog of openssh mentioning this but wasnt sure if this applies.
[20:06:16] <leah2> perhaps you can enable sha2 on the server again
[20:07:04] <entropie> yeah, need to to this. Thanks

[23:41:29] <John_Ivan> weaksauce, Eloquent_Ruby; Document class; word.size
[23:41:42] <John_Ivan> I sure hope I can do word().size(), right?
[23:44:08] <John_Ivan> nevermind. "Ruby tries hard not to require any syntax it can do without and a great example of this
[23:44:08] <John_Ivan> is its treatment of parentheses. When you define or call a method, you are free to add
[23:44:08] <John_Ivan> or omit the parentheses around the arguments. "
[23:45:18] <John_Ivan> thank god
[23:45:22] <John_Ivan> I mean
[23:45:24] <John_Ivan> thank Allah.
