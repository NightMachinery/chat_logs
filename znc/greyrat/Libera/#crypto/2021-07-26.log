[02:55:03] <ytrezq> Hello, this might sound off?topic, but is related to the cryptographic design knowlwedge. How can you ask someone to prove his computational power over the phone ? Or rather, which math forumla using common maths which can be computed using ??? or an high end Casio where the simplest case to get 5 or 3 digits requires maximum computational complexity ? Rules are detailed here https://math.stackexchange.com/q/4206388
[02:56:57] <danieldg> artificial constratints make the problem pretty pointless

[02:59:31] <ms7821> ytrezq: so the answer is "it's against the rules"? where did the rules comes from?
[02:59:52] <ms7821> what's the actualy goal of the challenge? is it to identify whether someone has a high-end Casio calculator in particular?
[03:00:26] <ytrezq> I wrote the requirements here https://math.stackexchange.com/q/4206388
[03:00:28] <ms7821> what if their calculator takes too long to provide an answer in a reasonable amount of time? Do you allow a few different answers to gauge the result on a scale?
[03:00:37] <ms7821> I've read the requirements, they make very little sense
[03:00:43] <ytrezq> Delay also detailed here [26/07/2021 00:30:22] <ms7821> what if their calculator takes too long to provide an answer in a reasonable amount of time? Do you allow a few different answers to gauge the result on a scale?
[03:01:41] <ms7821> so your high-level goal is to create a _single_ result that someone with a calculator can generate but someone without can't? Is that it?
[03:02:23] <ms7821> cuz you then mention GMP ffs
[03:02:57] <ms7821> between a calculator and something running GMP, you're talking about a difference in computational speed of factors of billions
[03:03:22] <ytrezq> The challange and the control of the response is managed by voicemail [26/07/2021 00:29:47] <ms7821> what's the actualy goal of the challenge? is it to identify whether someone has a high-end Casio calculator in particular?
[03:03:43] <ytrezq> Rules :
[03:03:45] <ytrezq> There are no cases where the challenge being asked should simplify to the point it can be done by hand or on simple ??? like Z80.
[03:03:46] <ytrezq> Callee is not aware of the type of challenge he will be prompted to so he/she isn?t able to precompute the result, thus he/she must not be able to look for a precomputed result online (like finding a nth trillion digit of ?).
[03:03:48] <ytrezq> The result should consist of digits in order to be possibly dialed.
[03:03:49] <ytrezq> As dialing or dictating long numbers manually is error prone, the challenge as well as the result should consist of numbers no longer than 9 digits and it should involve as fewest verbal steps as possible. No more than 5 steps.
[03:03:51] <ytrezq> It should not be possible to guess the result trivially in a probabilistic manner : this excludes yes/no questions or cases where the result is between 0 and 9 or things like asking the color of a pixel.
[03:03:51] <ms7821> I've read the rules, please dont' paste them here
[03:03:52] <ytrezq> It should be platform agnostic : it should take 2 minutes on an high?end Casio if the requirement is low or with using only ???/???? on a high end computer if the requirement is high. As a result, this tends to exclude common hash functions.
[03:03:54] <ytrezq> ??? requirement is preferred over speed.

[03:08:11] <danieldg> is this voicemail part of the exam?
[03:08:29] <ytrezq> pure common math. No hash functions, as written in my requirements
[03:09:03] <ms7821> your problem as worded does not have a solution, you'll have to change something
[03:10:46] <danieldg> or just use the sin function
[03:11:10] <danieldg> result = sin(input)
[03:11:28] <ms7821> that can be done on a z80
[03:11:48] <danieldg> anything can be done on a z80
[03:11:52] <ms7821> quite
[03:11:53] <danieldg> I can run sha512 on a z80
[03:12:26] <ytrezq> Even in degrees, the result is predicatable [26/07/2021 00:41:04] <danieldg> result = sin(input)
[03:12:34] <danieldg> after all, a Ryzen processor is just a z80 with a few extra instructions :p
[03:12:55] <ytrezq> In my case, the calculator cpu has a 80286 clone
[03:13:05] <ytrezq> the one I’m thinking about
[03:13:15] <ytrezq> and 512Kb of ʀᴀᴍ
[03:13:35] <danieldg> yeah, that's way more capable than your non-programmable calculator
[03:14:03] <ytrezq> It is not programmable. But it has arbitrary precision mode called cas mode
[03:14:07] <danieldg> I can easily make a challenge it can pass but you can't, but not the other way around
[03:14:26] <danieldg> a z80 can do  that too
[03:14:31] <ytrezq> I can solve any one line math
[03:14:36] <ms7821> so the result needs to be unpredictable regardless of input? because my assumption was danielg was suggesting that the verifier generates the input at random

[03:15:11] <ytrezq> pi()

[03:16:58] <ytrezq> I failed to see such type of thing would overload the calculator I’m thinking about. What’s the challenge ? Ask the nᵗ̑h million digit ?
[03:17:06] <ms7821> and if you want a "work factor", just keep calling sin() on the result
[03:17:31] <ms7821> but then people with low-end calculators will be hitting sin constantly for 2 minutes while making sure they don't miscount
[03:17:45] <ms7821> so this seems like a really weird way of proving anything
[03:18:35] <ytrezq> It’s a manual thing. And I feel you can directly compute the result instead or repeatedely do it in a naIve way
