[01:31:40] <Alucard> hi, I'm having an issue with Archlinux 5.14.3-arch1-1 and VMware Workstation 16.1.2 build-17966106, everytime I try and copy a file to and from my VM (to any disk on my system) or try and create a Disk in VMWare my system locks up after it hits around the   60GB mark and then crashes. It even happens when transferring data from one drive to another, I managed to get a journal log from when it happened. https://pastebin.com/3qC7wqgW -
[01:31:40] <Alucard> weirdly this guy from 2013 has the same issue https://bugs.launchpad.net/linuxmint/+bug/1241140 and I haven't seen any remedy for it. I've checked the drives using smartclt and they've passed, they're also less than 6 months old.

[03:21:39] <nattiestnate> hi, so i have RHEL 7.5 running in a virtual machine, which has 2 network interfaces: eth0, which is connected to a host-only network with a fixed ip (192.168.42.10) and gateway 192.168.42.1, and eth1 connected to NAT with DHCP. so with this configuration i can't connect to the internet. if i attempt to ping 8.8.8.8, it returns: From 192.168.42.1 icmp_seq=n Destination Port Unreachable (n being a
[03:21:42] <nattiestnate> number). *however*, if i swap the networks (i.e. eth0 connected to NAT while eth1 connected to host-only network), i can access both the host-only network, and the internet at the same time. what's the reason behind this?

[07:52:53] <coldenbrewed> If I have an ongoing cp -r command running in a ssh connection, what happens if I close it?

[07:53:08] <coldenbrewed> will the cp -r also end or is there a way for it to keep going?
[07:53:11] <[[R]]> end
[07:53:22] <[[R]]> go back in time and start it in screen
[07:53:30] <coldenbrewed> then I suppose I have to fork it into the background?
[07:53:41] <hackinghorn> coldenbrewed, use tmux or screen (screen sucks)

[07:54:41] <Caffeinated> you could run your cp -r in screen or tmux
[07:54:51] <mlu> and sometimes, I might even run screen inside a virtual terminal inside a vnc over a remote X11 session

[07:55:07] <coldenbrewed> Is there a simpler way?
[07:55:10] <coldenbrewed> like forking the command?
[07:55:14] <hackinghorn> dont use screen, you get confused with "screen" like this
[07:55:20] <mlu> yeah -- screen and tmux cerate their own ttys so you can detach and reattach (and even multi-attach) as necessary
[07:55:36] <coldenbrewed> I get it now, but is there anything simpler?
[07:55:44] <[[R]]> hwo is screen or tmux not simple?
[07:55:45] <mlu> many people argue which is better: I personally like GNU Screen, but tmux people really like tmux
[07:55:51] <mags> for right now, couldn't you just Ctl-Z and `bg` it?
[07:55:55] <mlu> they're as simple as they get
[07:55:55] <coldenbrewed> I would have to install it
[07:55:58] <[[R]]> omg
[07:56:00] <[[R]]> install it
[07:56:05] <hackinghorn> xD
[07:56:08] <[[R]]> well thats it, may as well just give up
[07:56:12] <mlu> screen comes preinstalled on many (but not all) distros
[07:56:29] <mlu> and it's much easier to get working than any VNC type setup

[12:11:18] <feep[work]> hey, random question
[12:11:29] <feep[work]> why doesn't unix/linux create a folder when you try to write a file to a folder that doesn't exist?
[12:11:45] <feep[work]> is it just "that's not what was historically done", or is there a specific reason
[12:11:56] *** Quits: Epsilon (~Epsilon@user/epsilon) (Remote host closed the connection)
[12:11:57] <alkisg> random answer: 42
[12:11:59] <feep[work]> I'm thinking about systems like git, where folders don't even exist except in the context of files
[12:12:07] <alkisg> Hehe well, the programmer might want to get notified about the issue and do an action
[12:12:14] *** Joins: Epsilon (~Epsilon@user/epsilon)
[12:12:21] <feep[work]> right, but 99% of the time the action is going to be "create the folder"
[12:12:45] <feep[work]> and the 1% is a typo, lol.
[12:13:01] <alkisg> Haha. You're probably thinking "users", not "programmers"
[12:13:09] <feep[work]> no I'm thinking programmers
[12:13:13] <alkisg> For programmers, in 99% that would be a programmer error
[12:13:34] <feep[work]> huh? you try to open a log file, you get an access error, your reaction is still going to be "fine, so create the log folder first", right?
[12:13:38] <alkisg> Because the programmer would first need to check if the directory is there, and create it. Or if he was doing that frequently, he could easily write a wrapper for it
[12:13:48] <alkisg> No, log folders usually have specific owners
[12:13:58] *** Joins: THE_GFR|WORK (~THE_GFR_W@23-24-255-177-static.hfc.comcastbusiness.net)
[12:13:59] <alkisg> I would never want that auto-created
[12:14:05] <feep[work]> right but my point is, he wouldn't need to do any of that if the system just created it for him with the default rights of the current user
[12:14:09] <alkisg> drwxrwxr-x 14 root syslog 4096 Sep 16 00:00 /var/log
[12:14:21] <akik> feep[work]: which system works like that?
[12:14:32] <feep[work]> none
[12:14:37] <feep[work]> and I'm wondering why :p
[12:14:41] <alkisg> So the system would have a list of all possible userland directories and their appropriate owners and permissions?
[12:15:00] <alkisg> So e.g. the samba developers would need to send a kernel patch just for that?
[12:15:04] <feep[work]> no?
[12:15:40] <feep[work]> the idea is, if you treat folders as sort of a weird side effect of files, the entire idea of folder permissions kinda falls by the wayside. I'm not actually convinced folders need to have permissions at all.
[12:15:47] <Dagmar> You need to ask yourself what it's supposed to be writing
[12:15:48] <alkisg> Many directories are created as part of postinst script, which run as admin
[12:15:52] <Dagmar> A directory is *not* a file.

[12:16:01] <alkisg> While the apps themselves run as users, they don't even have the permissions to create the dirs
[12:16:28] <feep[work]> like, I guess the idea would be, anyone could create a file anywhere, and you just check explicitly for user/group membership when reading
[12:16:37] <feep[work]> which I guess just moves the difficulty to that part, so fair enough
[12:16:42] <feep[work]> PATH would become a lot weirder
[12:16:51] <feep[work]> but maybe also useless?
[12:17:07] <alkisg> PATH is for searching binaries, it's not related to creating directories...

[12:30:50] <DPA> Since the outsider probably won't have the server as default gataway in this case, he'll need static routes for the subnets to be accessed. But then, that's just routing, and not nat anymore, I think. To nat this stuff, set up an iptables rule for masquerading.

[12:36:26] <DPA> Well, network devices can only send ethernet packages directly to the next hop/router using it's mac which it needs to know. That one then needs to know how to further forward the package. That's routing. and doesn't change any source / destination IPs.
[12:36:26] <DPA> Nat is changing one of the IPs, to change the logical IP a package appears to have come from. In iptables, thats what masquerading does.

[15:27:59] <No1x3r0> BCMM "terminal settings" being shells ?
[15:28:04] <No1x3r0> or shell layouts ?
[15:28:12] <BCMM> No1x3r0: no, not at all
[15:28:40] <No1x3r0> ?
[15:29:03] <BCMM> No1x3r0: this is probably a bit outdated because i hear they've changed the w10 terminal quite a bit, but as of win 7, the terminal windows for cmd and powershell had different colour schemes, different settings for copy/paste, etc.
[15:29:22] <BCMM> which obscured the fact that they were different shells using the exact same terminal
[15:29:36] <BCMM> which thereby obscured the difference between the shell and the terminal
[15:29:52] <No1x3r0> what shells were they ?

[15:31:18] <No1x3r0> and how do shells correlate to command line interpreter ?
[15:31:24] <BCMM> i think i'm making my point really badly here. cmd and powershell are shells.
[15:31:44] <BCMM> shell is pretty much synonymous with (interactive) command interpreter
[15:32:01] <No1x3r0> I thought Command.com now cmd was a command line interpreter
[15:32:44] <No1x3r0> so a cli pretty much is a shell ?
[15:33:01] <No1x3r0> i=interpreter != interface
[15:33:07] <BCMM> No1x3r0: it's just a terminology thing
[15:33:54] <BCMM> yes, i think microsoft always called cmd a "command-line interpreter"
[15:34:06] <No1x3r0> BCMM, but I thought there was a slight distinction due to "shell accounts" back in the day for terminal emulation to main frames

[15:35:02] <BCMM> No1x3r0: the initialism CLI is usually expanded to "command-line interface", rather than "command-line interpreter"
[15:35:27] <cousteau> What file names are valid in Linux?  I understand that they can contain any character except / and \0 and that they can't be "." nor ".."
[15:35:35] <cousteau> Any other exception?
[15:35:42] <No1x3r0> yeah, reason I wrote it as i=interpreter != interface for the context of my use
[15:35:55] <BCMM> oh right, i'm understanding it now
[15:35:57] <No1x3r0> to clarify my intent
[15:36:12] <djph> No1x3r0: it more meant that you had an account to ACCESS the mainframe.  Back in the day, a lot of work was still done paper/pencil or inter-office mail on real paper
[15:36:17] <BCMM> yeah, i think it was just microsoft and unix worlds using different terminology
[15:36:34] <BCMM> as far as i know, a "shell account" is just an account that permits shell access
[15:36:39] <djph> ^^^^^
[15:36:48] <BCMM> as opposed to, for example, an account that only gives you FTP or email
[15:37:08] <No1x3r0> djph, but in those days did they have two different type of things called shells? one being an account and another being a command line interpreter
[15:37:16] <djph> These days, we'd probably call them "virtual accounts"

[15:37:58] <hexnewbie> I wrote a CLI shell in a CLI language, and it would refuse to process more than CLI lines. Ah, whatever, screw it, I'm off to watch CLI.

[15:38:14] <djph> No1x3r0: no no, the "shell account" being the account necessary to access the shell.  In modern terms, it'd be like my buddy who has an email-only "virtual account" on my domain.
[15:38:29] <BCMM> No1x3r0: you're talking about the thing where you dial in (or latterly connect over the internet) to a remote machine, and then you can run commands on that machine, right?
[15:38:30] <cousteau> What is a "shell", even?  I would have assumed "command interpreter", but then there are things such as "Gnome shell"

[15:39:01] <BCMM> cousteau: "graphical shell" is a pretty old usage
[15:39:09] <cousteau> I see
[15:39:12] <BCMM> i think even windows uses it to refer to explorer, gdi etc
[15:39:20] <rouji> it does
[15:39:23] <cousteau> So pretty much "interface"?
[15:39:43] <BCMM> cousteau: but, like, the top-level interface that you use to get to the rest of the interface, if you see what i mean?

[15:39:53] <djph> cousteau: it is an application that allows you to work with the machine.  "gnome-shell" (etc) are those virtual-terminal applications that we use to give ourselves a terminal-interface on a graphical login.
[15:40:17] <BCMM> cousteau: if you think about it, actual shell and graphical shells they actually do the same thing: they're the environment you see when you first log in, and they allow you to launch other programs that you might want to use
[15:40:39] <No1x3r0> djph but I thought they used emulators (TN3270), oh wait I guess they were virtual ones too like the VT
[15:40:43] <cousteau> BCMM: the "topmost layer", sort of?
[15:40:45] <djph> cousteau: I don't _need_ gnome-shell (or xfce4-terminal, etc) to launch the bash shell -- all I need for that is the system to be providing a TTY.
[15:40:48] <BCMM> djph: sounds like you're describing gnome-terminal there. gnome shell is the gnome desktop environment

[15:41:11] <hexnewbie> Windows land used to use ‘shell’ only for its graphical shell (DOS shell was an explicit GUI for DOS), and Unix-like land only for its command line shell. PowerShell and GNOME Shell broke the tradition

[15:45:36] <hexnewbie> Especially among users, a ‘shell’ for Windows users was a shell replacement like LiteStep (or Classic Shell in modern days), probably accurate as your primary interface was never a command line (even the improved NT command line sucked). Among *nix users, the graphical shells were called WMs (even when they were DEs), and never ‘shell’

[18:10:42] <lopid> there is always a risk of losing files when you reinstall an os. just be careful how you go about it
[18:10:47] <xiaomiao> if in doubt think about every command you want to execute three times
[18:11:10] <Guest92> i mean if everything went smooth installing the said NewOs
[18:11:23] <hexnewbie> Guest92: If you are not sure, yes. (Some people who are sure also succeed.) You should always have backups whatever you do or do not.
[18:11:30] <Guest92> the files themselves will be still readable in it?

[18:13:57] <hexnewbie> Encryption prioritises data confidentiality over preserving the data, as if by design you're more likely to lose it than for someone else to take it from you (certain conditions apply)

[18:15:11] <hexnewbie> That *usually* involves forgetting the passphrase, or corruption of the key slots, *NOT* reinstallation. But there are creative way to lose data during reinstallation, and encryption adds complexity which in turns add more such ways.
