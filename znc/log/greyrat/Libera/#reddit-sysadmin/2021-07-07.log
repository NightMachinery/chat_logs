[21:30:30] <shakygator> i know
[21:30:33] <sd> 08<bâ€‹denlinger> honestly I would ask your management for some guidence
[21:30:41] <sd> 12<Sâ€‹obia> When you're interviewing people, it's really about preference. I always prefer to know the persons work ethic and how they fit into our culture. Information can be learned, but personalities and motivation is difficult to "learn".
[21:31:06] <shakygator> you can usually infer a bit about their personality during the interview
[21:31:22] <shakygator> specifically im doing the technical part of the interviews though, so i dont care too much about other stuff
[21:31:32] <shakygator> 1) can they do the job, 2) do they annoy me
[21:31:46] <sd> 12<Sâ€‹obia> Obviously, depending on the job, there's a threshold. Not about to hire someone who doesn't know what an ethernet cable is... but still. That's usually how I handle the interviews. I focus on their ability to solve problems. I also always throw a question they shouldn't know the answer to in there to see if they BS me or say "I don't know but here's how I'd find out"
[21:31:57] <sd> 12<Sâ€‹obia> There's no perfect way to interview though. People can BS through lots
[21:31:58] <shakygator> but i still feel like im all over the place, i have a list of things i refer to so i dont forget to ask things
[21:32:11] <shakygator> well this isnt an entry level job, im interviewing people for sr devops roles
[21:32:35] <shakygator> so i make them explain things like how kubernetes works, or how youd achieve X
[21:32:50] <shakygator> or what tool to use for X task, etc

[21:33:31] <sd> 12<Sâ€‹obia> The difference between a high level technical employee and a lower level technical employee isn't just knowledge, it's also troubleshooting ability. So figuring out how they narrow down an issue or if they tend to go down rabbit holes is something feasible you can do during an interview. Interviews are just seeing if they're a good fit for a trial run. You can't discern everything from it. They have to do the job.
[21:34:11] <sd> 12<Sâ€‹obia> Also if you can find a good technical resource with good knowledge and troubleshooting ability AND good communication skills with those less savvy, that's a godsend.
[21:34:20] <sd> 08<bâ€‹denlinger> Do you all have a preference for Azure CLI or Azure Powershell??? I'm kinda confused why both exist.
[21:34:26] <shakygator> agreed, which is why i ask things like "tell me about your k8s clusters, platforms, etc" and then i build on that and go deeper with specifics
[21:35:09] <shakygator> @bdenlinger prob cuz powershell is the native windows tool and M$ things
[21:35:13] <sd> 12<Sâ€‹obia> If you leave the interview having questions about the candidate, figure out what those questions are and what questions you can ask to get your questions answered in future interviews.

[21:35:28] <sd> 12<Sâ€‹obia> Also powershell all day.
[21:36:08] <AnonymooseReddtr> hit them with a troubleshooting question
[21:36:18] <shakygator> yeah i guess im just looking for more structure, or at least reference material to see how other people handle it. today is my first panel interview so it will be nice to see how my coworkers approach it
[21:36:23] <AnonymooseReddtr> Client is reporting problems with X what sort of things would you check 
[21:36:27] <fritzwastaken> Do what my employer did and ask them to troubleshoot your oldest ticket

[21:36:56] <sd> 12<Sâ€‹obia> The best things to do is to de-stress in the opening questions. The interview process should be a relaxed process. I hate up tight interviews. Nobody wins those.

[21:38:26] <sd> 12<Sâ€‹obia> I literally start all my interviews off by asking something silly. "Where was the last place you vacationed to and what did you do there?" Nice relaxed conversation follows. Shake off them interview jitters.

[22:49:32] <sd> 06<Câ€‹omputer man, fix my pants!> have him flee to canada
[22:49:37] <fritzwastaken> but hes gunna go to jail for a little bit, so might as well have the coppers take him in
[22:49:42] <oxipital> i just figured maybe somneones dealt with this before.
[22:50:05] <JollyRgrs> 1) not me. 2) he made his bed, he needs to lay in it 3) what are you expecting to come out of this?
[22:50:17] <oxipital> i've suggested that he work out a plea and online peop;e are like turn yourself in to the *court*
[22:50:26] <JollyRgrs> either A) you front him $1000 (b/c I assume he doesn't have that) or B) he goes to jail for a bit
[22:50:48] <oxipital> i'm hoping a c: everyone gets a sense of perspective
[22:51:03] <JollyRgrs> yeah, i'd assume that #reddit-sysadmin is prob. not the most likely place to get  "experienced" answers from for your situation
[22:51:22] <sd> 06<Câ€‹omputer man, fix my pants!> don't underestimate us
[22:51:28] <oxipital> well, trust me the #legaladvice subreddit is pointless

[22:51:30] <JollyRgrs> I don't know what legal options you have
[22:51:32] <JollyRgrs> lol
[22:51:34] <CptLuxx> the discord people are pretty bad
[22:51:54] <JollyRgrs> they are only there to argue about petty legalities, not actually deal with stuff like a real lawyer
[22:52:14] <oxipital> it's totally like a room full of jollyrgrs going "lol you're fucked. and you're harboring a fugitive blah blah blah"
[22:52:22] <JollyRgrs> if they start the sentence "IANAL" or they are a laywer, but not a criminal defense lawyer... or even a prosecutor... i'd not pay much attn to them
[22:52:29] <JollyRgrs> oxipital: that's not what i said
[22:52:31] <sd> 06<Câ€‹omputer man, fix my pants!> reddit is mainly a place to argue about pointless minutiae, yes
[22:52:48] <JollyRgrs> if you get that out of what i said, then maybe #legaladvice wasn't so bad and you just twisted their answers, too
[22:53:11] * fritzwastaken walks up to scoreboard and marks 1 under JollyRgrs
[22:53:17] * fritzwastaken sits back down
[22:54:45] <JollyRgrs> i was merely saying that you don't want to acknowledge that you know he's got a warrant so you don't have to worry about knowingly harboring a fugative
[22:55:07] <signofzeta> Well, that's another problem.  He has to appear in court, but he has no car.  Did he ask for a ride or bus fare, at the very least?
[22:55:14] <JollyRgrs> but if you can contact the court... i'd suggest contacting the court would be better than contacting the local PD... but why can't your brother contact them himself?
[22:55:37] <oxipital> no, but the court is 30 miles way in rural missouri

[23:06:46] <shakygator> im not dev, most of my team is though. we have 6-8 devops people
[23:07:05] <oxipital> CableNinja, i doubt if that'd work
[23:07:15] <shakygator> thats my org, we are a 60k emp company. my brothers team is the one hiring them at 168k (hes hiring them)
[23:07:22] <shakygator> which is part of why i cant work for him either, probably
[23:07:31] <AnonymooseReddtr> lol

[23:08:21] <oxipital> iphone, amen
[23:08:30] <shakygator> our devs start at around 158, as of a few years ago, but you also have to live in sunnyvale
[23:08:37] <AnonymooseReddtr> i thought I was doing well 
[23:08:38] <AnonymooseReddtr> lol
[23:08:38] <oxipital> it should be on a directory somewhere
[23:08:50] <AnonymooseReddtr> new gig is a 30% raise over current
[23:08:55] <AnonymooseReddtr> plus car allowance, and stonk 
[23:09:04] <shakygator> yeah so i got a 250% raise when i took this job - so im still doing good for me
[23:09:09] <shakygator> but now i want that extra 60k
[23:09:14] <AnonymooseReddtr> lol shaky
[23:09:21] <shakygator> that was 5 years ago tho
[23:09:24] <shakygator> time for a new bump

[23:10:46] <AnonymooseReddtr> shakygator - did you find a huge culture shift going from 100 emp to 60
[23:10:49] <AnonymooseReddtr> 60k
[23:10:51] <shakygator> cuz they wanted me to relo to silicon valley
[23:11:19] <shakygator> a little bit, im remote so im a bit disconnected but yeah. like - compliance training
[23:11:20] <iphone> they wanted you to pay most of your money on taxes, and then half of the remainder on rent
[23:12:02] <shakygator> the SVP that hired me left last year so my whole org changed up but i dig this new team. we have 4.5d work weeks (theyre pushing for 4d) and they give me shit like a bunch of doordash GCs every week, send me expensive care packages (burgers, steaks, ice cream, etc)
[23:12:47] <technonerd> is it sunday yet?
[23:13:39] <oxipital> i figure the who you know is the end all be all of getting hired
[23:15:13] <shakygator> it literally is
[23:17:31] <CableNinja> I dont find that to be the case
[23:17:49] <CableNinja> however, dont piss off people in our industry, because its a small world
[23:18:24] <CableNinja> theres potential for you either running into companies you worked for/with in the past, and if you rub someone the wrong way, they'll remember it
[23:19:55] <oxipital> you know, if i was interviewing someone and another interviewer admitted that was why they were against hiring some one i'd probably report them

[23:44:28] <shakygator> if you want perf out of it anyways
[23:44:47] <shakygator> yeah like if you try to move/sync a bunch of files it will run like dogshit
[23:44:54] <CableNinja> well, it cant be worse than transferring 5GB from NFS via SCP to AWS
[23:45:06] <CableNinja> oxipital, it would never work, the AI would start drinking hydraulic fluid heavily because the problem is constantly changing
[23:45:35] <shakygator> we have an EKS cluster we were backing with EFS and the cluster ran jenkins, so during builds it would pull down sbt dependencies etc, and it would takes HOURS
[23:45:38] <CableNinja> scp isnt my choice... its what packer does :(
[23:45:43] <shakygator> we switched to NFS instead and it was down to minutes
[23:45:53] <CableNinja> hm
[23:46:02] <shakygator> i think EFS trying to replicate between AZs causes it to degrade perf
[23:46:07] <meme> CableNinja have you tried SCP-173?
[23:48:51] <CableNinja> shakygator, ah, wouldnt be using it for that. just need it in one region/az
[23:50:52] <CableNinja> fml... 3.24GB in 45 minutes
[23:51:06] <CableNinja> i dont get it, this shit keeps like pausing
[23:51:20] <CableNinja> sends a few hundred mb and then freezes for more than a minute

[23:52:57] <sideup66> Wat
[23:53:06] <sideup66> Can I blame OnePlus? Not really
[23:53:16] <sideup66> While that is infact shitty
[23:53:34] <sideup66> App devs need to be pressured to not have their apps run like shit (usually bad code tbh)
[23:53:54] <oxipital> awesome
[23:54:12] <CableNinja> sideup66, tell the CEO to stop pushing for faster and faster builds then
[23:54:36] <CableNinja> and make the rest of the company chill the fuck out, let the dev team do proper dev processes like code review and QA
[23:54:48] <sideup66>  Ceo of said app? Agreed. But the thing is if the phone runs like shit the mfg or their room gets wrongly blamed
[23:55:02] <oxipital> someone just knocked oon my office door "so and so needs a flash drive. they somewhere in there somewhere. you need to make something for them to sign saying you gave it to them"
[23:55:02] <CableNinja> sure, but still, same applies
[23:56:08] <CableNinja> oxipital, "by signing this you hereby agree that you have received item X with serial number ABC, failure to return device at end of employment will result in me shitting on your kitchen counter every day until the item is returned"
[23:56:32] <oxipital> i can't print anythong
[23:56:46] <CableNinja> write it on a sticky note
[23:56:50] <oxipital> i don't have a domain account; i can't even login
[23:56:52] <CableNinja> and use a highlighter
[23:57:22] <shakygator> CableNinja, i dont remember can you setup EFS on just one AZ?
[23:57:26] <CableNinja> man this movie is so ridiculous, I cant even believe I bothered to watch it
[23:57:40] <CableNinja> idk, I didnt really look, but we'd only need one AZ
[23:58:10] <sintax> which movie CableNinja 
[23:58:16] <sd> 08<câ€‹ritamine> Ugh I planned on driving tonight
[23:58:18] <CableNinja> The Car (1977)
[23:58:20] <sintax> ah
[23:58:31] <shakygator> i feel like EFS you just pick the region and it has AZ endpoints, maybe i guess that depends on how you built your VPC CableNinja
