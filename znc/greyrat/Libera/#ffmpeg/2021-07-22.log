With audacity's "noise reduction" effect I can perfectly remove the background music, by using a separate audio clip with just the music to create a profile: https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/noise_reduction.html .

[20:41:23] <DHE> so... in an AVFrame's side data the actual payloads are refcounted using AVBufferRef, but when a frame is copied using av_frame_copy_props it's not using the refcount and making a fresh buffer with a count of 1. I feel like this defeats the purpose, doesn't it?

[20:46:45] <BtbN> no, it's called copy_props after all, not ref_props
[20:46:57] <BtbN> Otherwise, if someone modified the old frame, those changes would also show up on the new one
[20:47:04] <kepstin> i think that makes sense, since it explicitly says "copy", it's actually a function run internally as part of av_frame_make_writable() in order to give you a writable copy of the properties
[20:47:22] *** Quits: dropkick (~dropkick@185.226.144.52) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[20:47:39] <DHE> but it's also exposed in the public API, and used by other code with no ref version available
[20:48:06] <DHE> there's an internal static function to do that, and av_frame_copy_props just calls this internal function with force_copy=1, whereas with force_copy=0 it would do a refcount
[20:49:27] <kepstin> fwiw, it's pretty important to keep the writability of the properties in sync with the frame data (or at least, properties should be at least as writable as frame data)
[20:50:14] <DHE> maybe context would help. I'm experimenting with vf_yadif in field mode, turning 1080i into 1080p60. but the side data for closed captions are duplicated effectively corrupting them
[20:50:22] <DHE> *1080i30
[20:51:02] <DHE> my original plan was to check if the same AVBufferRef payload has been returned twice in a row and prune it out. but av_frame_copy_props is used by yadif and renders this scheme unusable
[20:51:11] <DHE> and I can't think of any other alternatives

[20:52:25] <DHE> I'm not sure that's right either. just delete the CC data on every other frame?
[20:53:45] <kepstin> yeah? seems like it would work fine. Just make sure to only do it in send_field mode.
[20:54:18] <DHE> I guess... it just seems more fragile...
[20:54:21] <kepstin> (probably some complications when dealing with the "only deinterlace frames marked as interlaced mode to worry about, too)
[20:56:07] <DHE> yeah. I saw that option, and elected to turn it off. so.. I guess it's safe?

[20:56:48] <kepstin> well, going back to the old analogue standards, CC data was on a line in only one of the two fields in a frame
[20:57:01] <kepstin> so if you're deinterlacing fields to frames, the CC data should be on one of them, and not on the other
[20:57:48] <kepstin> (it probably doesn't really matter which one, tbh, but i'd leave it on the first produced frame from a given input frame)
[20:58:05] <DHE> yeah that's what the original goal was. the question is, how do I definitively identify that?
[20:58:33] <kepstin> well, yadif takes 1 input frame and produces 2 output frames. so it should know which one is the first and which is the second?
[20:59:04] <kepstin> i'm not familiar with the code structure of that filter, i guess it might not be obvious which frame is which :/
[20:59:08] *** Joins: AbleBacon (~AbleBacon@user/AbleBacon)
[20:59:09] <DHE> presumably. but it uses av_frame_copy_props and both output frames get the same side data, but without any refcounting
[20:59:24] *** Joins: xlei (znc@pool-68-129-84-118.nycmny.fios.verizon.net)
[20:59:40] <DHE> and since it's modifying frames obviously it has to do something with writable frames
[20:59:54] <kepstin> and if frames are writable, then props must also be writable
[21:00:53] <kepstin> (as far as i can tell, av_frame_ref/clone is the only way to get referenced props, and they are of course copied when the frame is made writable)
[21:01:48] <DHE> yeah... my first "solution" was to add av_frame_copy_props_ref() which preserves the reference counts of side data, and make yadif use it...
[21:02:45] <kepstin> the problem is that the way frames are checked for writability is by the number of references on the data buffer. so you're not permitted to have a frame with 1 reference on data buffer but >1 reference of side data
[21:03:06] *** Joins: someuser (~user@41.44.143.198)
[21:03:46] <DHE> "drop every other frame's data" is looking like the best solution
[21:04:09] <kepstin> you shouldn't drop all side data tho, i think. just the CC data.
[21:07:48] <kepstin> fwiw, i assume this CC duplication issue affects a lot of filters
[21:08:10] <kepstin> 'fps' filter in particular would just completely butcher it, since it both drops and duplicates frames
[21:09:18] <kepstin> would really be best if the CC data could be split out to subtitle or subtitle-like frames, processed separately from video, and then optionally combined back in later
[21:23:31] <DHE> ideally. and there is a ccaption_dec decoder for the closed captions. but that's not quite enough without re-implementing something I guess?
