[00:18:57] <Alipha> neiluj: easiest way to prevent replay is to increment the nonce (is this bi- or multi-directional communication? if so, you should use a different symmetric key for each direction) and then discard messages with nonces older than (or equal to) the most-recent nonce you've seen. if you need to allow out-of-order arrival of messages, then you can do something like only allow nonces >= most_recent_nonce - 100,
[00:18:59] <Alipha> and keep track of the 100 last used nonces to make sure they haven't been reused (i.e., sliding window)
[00:22:05] <tusko> nonces are used once and never reused

[10:50:24] <sshine> hello!
[10:50:42] <sshine> I recently got the idea that I'd want to add an SSHFP record to my domain(s).
[10:52:00] <sshine> running ssh-keyscan -D, I realised that I'd either need to add a whole bunch of those, or narrow down the ones I use. running my sshd by sshaudit.com I got the impression that the defaults (both in Linux and FreeBSD) are really quite forgiving, and perhaps I don't need to be this open-minded about Ciphers and MACs.
[10:53:09] *** Quits: Gallomimia (~Gallomimi@node-1w7jra2a2gqpxalwdo3vacpbu.ipv6.telus.net) (Remote host closed the connection)
[10:53:30] <sshine> as far as I understand, there are five settings I could be tinkering with in sshd_config: Ciphers, MACs, HostKeyAlgorithms, KexAlgorithms, PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes.
[10:56:32] <sshine> for HostKeyAlgorithms, I thought I'd exclusively pick ed25519, but since I want to turn this into an Ansible script, I thought... maybe it's better to keep rsa-sha2-512, since that's typically what you have until you get an opinion.
[10:56:57] <sshine> (just to avoid randomly locking out people, including my future self who lost an opinion about key types.)
[10:57:55] <sshine> so here's a question: what are all the variations for? ssh-ed25519-cert-v01@openssh.com,rsa-sha2-512-cert-v01@openssh.com,rsa-sha2-256-cert-v01@openssh.com,rsa-sha2-512
[11:01:20] <sshine> err, besides the ed25519, of course. I meant, what are all the @openssh.com variations that mention "cert" for?

[11:27:14] <tusko> What's going on there? what's the significance of the modulus?
[11:28:28] <riv> the probability of being prime is independent of modulus (as long as there are any primes at all in that congruence class)
[11:28:44] <riv> i.e there's as many primes = 1 mod 3 as there are = 2 mod 3
[11:29:17] <tusko> A randomly chosen number N satisfying N ≡ 1 (mod 6) has probability 3/ ln(N ) of being prime.
[11:29:34] <tusko> A randomly chosen number N satisfying N ≡ 1 (mod 3) has probability 3/(2 ln(N )) of being prime.
[11:29:48] <riv> there are phi(m) congruence classes mod m with infinitely many primes in them
[11:29:56] <tusko> A randomly chosen odd number N has probability 2/ ln(N ) of being prime.
[11:30:06] <riv> so I would say that there is phi(m)/m * whatever PNT gives you for the probability
[11:30:14] <riv> your formula doesn't include phi(m) which I find sus
[11:30:38] <tusko> phi() u greek bro?
[11:31:05] <riv> yes, mu nu omicron pi etc.
[11:31:13] <int-e> a randomly chosen number N satisfying N = 2 (mod 6) has probability 0 of being prime
[11:31:24] <tusko> ^
[11:32:05] <tusko> I'm just not seeing the underlying theme here.
[11:32:53] <tusko> Why does a randomly chosen number N satisfying N ≡ k (mod m) have probability m/2/ln(N) of being prime?
[11:33:01] <int-e> But if k is coprime to N you'll get m/(phi(m)ln(N)).
[11:33:15] <int-e> phi(6) = phi(3) = 2 is a bit of an accident here
[11:33:47] <tusko> wut
[11:34:03] <int-e> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem#Prime_number_theorem_for_arithmetic_progressions
[11:36:26] <maroon> tusko, which values mod6 would you say can possibly be prime?
[11:36:45] <tusko> only the odd ones
[11:36:52] <maroon> even 3? :)
[11:38:24] <tusko> no, not 3 and not 2 or 4
[11:38:47] <maroon> 6x+3 would always be composite because the 3 shares a factor >1 with the modulus
[11:39:50] <maroon> so since there's only 2 remainders left, half of all primes should use each of them
[11:41:34] <maroon> but if your modulus is 5 or 7, the primes get spread across more buckets than 2
[11:42:26] <riv> we doing this in both channels at once
[11:43:57] <tusko> maroon, right, I think buckets is a good way of thinking about it
[11:44:19] <tusko> so if all the primes are going to 1,5 modulo 6, say
[11:44:37] <tusko> that's 2/5, so where does 3/2 come from?
[11:44:47] <maroon> the density of primes below N is supposed to be 1 per ln(n), so if you're restricting it to be only odd numbers half of numbers are odd, so therefore the density is 2/ln(n) instead of 1/ln(n)
[11:45:21] <tusko> right
[11:45:32] <tusko> if we exclude even numbers
[11:45:53] <maroon> your modulus is preventing k from being greater than m, but it has nothing to do with the scope for N
[11:47:37] <tusko> I'm interested in the probability of selecting a prime when choosing N randomly s.t N = 1 (mod 6), say
[11:48:33] <maroon> is their example stating that m is prime? because that's the only way that all buckets [0,m-1] contain a prime
[11:48:35] *** Quits: mononote (~mononote@user/mononote) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[11:49:24] <tusko> oh right, m is a product of distinct primes, k is a number s.t gcd(k,m) = 1
[11:49:27] <maroon> when choosing N randomly, it depends on ln(n). if n=2^8192 it's harder to find a prime than if n=2^1024
[11:50:12] <maroon> can you clarify? to me product means the result of multiplication, so it would be composite unless one of the numbers being multiplied is 1
[11:50:22] <tusko> I'm interested in knowing A randomly chosen number N satisfying N = k (mod m) has probability _____/ln(N) of being prime.
[11:51:04] <tusko> if, for N = 1 (mod 3) it is 3/(2ln(N))
[11:51:14] <tusko> if, for N = 1 (mod 6) it is 3/ln(N)
[11:51:26] <tusko> it makes me think maybe that blank space is m/2
[11:51:49] <int-e> Here's a random process for selecting N: Consider the set of primes that are 1 (mod 6). Choose 7 with probability 1/2, 13 with probability 1/4, 19 with probability 1/8, 31 with probabiity 1/16, and so on.
[11:52:08] <maroon> it depends on now many numbers in [2,m-1] share a factor >1 with m since those eliminate some of the buckets, forcing the remainder to be spread across the remaining buckets
[11:52:12] <int-e> This has a probability of 1 to produce a prime equal to 1 modulo 6.
[11:53:05] <int-e> tusko: It's clearly not what you want. But it's a valid possibility for randomly choosing a number.
[11:55:25] <int-e> maroon: indeed k needs to be coprime to m
[11:56:41] <tusko> but you could remove the restriction on m being a product of ditinct primes
[11:56:43] <maroon> so your probability as worded is how many coprime k's there are to m
[11:57:11] <maroon> yo mean m = prime * prime?
[11:57:50] <tusko> m = p1*p2*...pr
[11:58:07] <maroon> so product of 2+ primes?
[11:58:28] <tusko> p_i distinct
[11:58:47] <tusko> yep
[11:58:55] <int-e> also half of this discussion is happening in ##math
[11:59:59] <int-e> maroon: for composite m, p/(p-1) generalizes to m/phi(m)
[12:03:31] <maroon> int-e, does p/(p-1) mean like 82/83?
[12:04:40] <int-e> no, it would be 83/82

[20:14:20] <dostoyevsky2> I also don't want to blindly install any software for managing the yubikey, but with Linux it can handle it with standard packages.  I hope the backup keys (in case one loses the other key) can be setup without an online connection... But just to know whether it's genuine, you need to give the yubikey website access to your key via usb
[20:15:24] <iz> dostoyevsky2: just generate your yubikey keys on a different device and import them, so then you can back them up yourself
[20:15:52] <iz> if you generate on device, there's no export key functionality
[20:18:51] <dostoyevsky2> iz: you mean: If I generate the keys on my linux laptop, and then import them into they key, I could also import them into other keys... but if I generate the keys directly on the yubikey, I can't export them?
[20:19:03] <iz> yeah
[20:19:11] <dostoyevsky2> ah, ok
[20:19:32] <iz> so if you like.. physically lose or accidentally destroy your yubikey
[20:19:46] <iz> you can just import your backed up keys to a new yubikey
[20:20:26] <iz> but yeah, it's one-way, can only import (for security reasons)
[20:20:53] <dostoyevsky2> sounds good... how does the yubikey actually know on Linux which key it would output when it's simulating a keyboard?  
[20:21:21] <iz> there is a openpgp smartcard standard
[20:21:51] <iz> and it basically shows up as a smartcard w/ that functionality over usb
[20:22:00] <iz> and then gpg knows how to interface w/ that

[20:23:18] <iz> so like you can do a sign/verify/encrypt/decrypt action with one of the 3 keys in there.. i think you get like a signing key, auth key, and encryption key, all signed under a master key
[20:23:42] <ms7821> it also has a HID mode where it just outputs alphanumeric strings
[20:23:52] <ms7821> which don't vary by scancode
[20:25:13] <ms7821> I assume if you set your layout to dvorak weird stuff happens
[20:26:00] <ms7821> oh, it has a separate dvorak mode

[20:54:00] <TimMc> One thing that bothers me with my yubikeys is that if I lose one, I don't have a good way of figuring out which sites and software I need to revoke it in.
[20:55:15] <TimMc> I suppose that's true for basically all 2FA though.
[20:55:42] <iz> TimMc: well, if you lose it, the keys within are pin protected
[20:55:59] <iz> and if you fail like 5 times it destroys the keys inside
[20:56:04] <TimMc> Oh, I just have U2F keys.
[20:56:20] <iz> ah, yeah, i only got mine for the openpgp smartcard functionality
[20:57:11] *** Joins: qbt (~qbt@user/edun)
[20:57:47] <dostoyevsky2> TimMc: I read that for 2FA you can simply remove the yubikey on websites and then just add a new one.  The only problem is e.g. if you have a yubikey USB-A and your second computer only has USB-C because then you can't login on both computers with two different versions of the key...
[20:58:24] <TimMc> dostoyevsky2: Right, but I don't have a list of where all I've used the key.
[20:58:30] <dostoyevsky2> I guess websites could support multiple keys though
[20:58:40] <TimMc> The *good* websites support two. :-)
[20:58:58] <TimMc> (Amazon... does not.)
[21:02:28] <dostoyevsky2> with two yubikeys I think you could get rid of a text message for fallback 2fa, to e.g. remove a key... 
[21:06:38] <dostoyevsky2> TimMc: Does it really matter to know where you used the yubikey if you can replace it easily?
