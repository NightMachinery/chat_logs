[01:53:50] <Bunny351> I wonder whether defaulting to "trusted" version for egg-downloads makes sense

[01:55:46] <Bunny351> IIUC, this means giving specific minimum versions to all dependencies and choose the newer one in case of conflict
[01:56:51] <Bunny351> additionally, if a newer version is already installed, use it

[12:27:48] <Techcable> Hi! I have a minor annoyance using Chicken on my 
[12:27:51] <Techcable> Mac
[12:28:21] <Techcable> When I'm on the repl and I use the arrow keys to move around it doesn't work
[12:28:48] <Techcable> Like <left arrow> <right arrow> doesn't work
[12:29:07] <Techcable> I just get ^[[D^[[D^[[D for left arrow and ^[[C^[[C^[[C^[[C for right arrow
[12:29:14] <Techcable> Is there a way to work around this?
[12:29:28] <s-liao> Did you install breadline egg?
[12:29:47] <wasamasa> yeah, you'll need to install and set up something providing readline-style editing
[12:30:53] <Techcable> Oh
[12:31:16] <wasamasa> or use rlwrap as a hack
[12:31:29] <wasamasa> which does that on the fly for any program
[12:32:21] <Techcable> Oh wow thanks
[12:32:25] <Techcable> I'll try both those things
[12:32:34] <Techcable> And I learned something new with `rlwrap` :)
[12:39:29] <Techcable> s-liao: breadline works great. Thank you :)
[12:41:09] <s-liao> You are welcome.

[22:04:08] <mario-goulart> sjamaan: that does look like a very deep can of worms.
[22:09:19] <mario-goulart> Bunny351: one concerns I have regarding eggs is the security thing.  If a server that hosts eggs gets cracked, malicious code can be released.  Luckily our egg system requires an explicit release (instead of, say, picking whatever is at the head of a random repo).  I don't know an easy way to mitigate that problem.
[22:15:35] <mario-goulart> I think people concerned about stability/security/reproducibility should probably mirror their inputs (e.g., eggs) and use their mirrors, with versions pinned and inputs hashed.
