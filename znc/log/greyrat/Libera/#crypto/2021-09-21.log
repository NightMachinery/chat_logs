[01:05:47] <dostoyevsky2> If I have two randomly named .crt files and a .key file for a https curl -- how do I know which of the crt files is the ca.crt?  Can I see this in the `openssl x509 -noout -text -in file.crt' somewhere?
[01:06:10] *** Quits: qbt (~edun@user/edun) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[01:06:45] <ms7821> the -text will tell you who the issuer is
[01:07:03] <ms7821> the ca (assuming it's a root) will be issued by itself
[01:07:08] <dostoyevsky2> ah
[01:08:45] <ms7821> (the ca will also have a ca flag, but checking the issuer is more useful)
[01:12:29] <dostoyevsky2> also, if I don't specify an expiry for a non-ca certificate will it just use the one from the CA?  I guess that's obvious, as they are both needed for https+cert ...  but I guess I could also specify an expiry as long as it's before the one of the CA...  longer than the CA might also be possible but it will need to be replaced when the CA is renewed, so will be unusable when the CA expires

[01:23:31] <ms7821> do I want to ask why you're issuing certs? it's super hard to do cert management safely and not something to roll by hand
[01:24:13] <ms7821> the expiry date will usually be set to a default of like now + 365 days
[01:25:06] <dostoyevsky2> ms7821: it seems to be common at work, and I want to unerstand that architecture... 
[01:25:13] <ms7821> o_O
[01:25:52] <dostoyevsky2> e.g. software products which we use for 100ks of servers usually ship with their own CAs
[01:26:48] <dostoyevsky2> and today I got a ticket that servers couldn't connect anymore, as the certs expired... so we escalated and it turns out it was a problem with the cert managment on the server side

[01:29:46] <ms7821> my general rule is that if a human has to be involved in certificate issuance something's gone wrong
[01:31:29] <Elon_Satoshi> why are https certs so complicated?
[01:31:33] <dostoyevsky2> well, but how would you secure internal rest apis -- with letsencrypt certificates?  Or buy them from verisign... quite expensive if you have millions of servers... 
[01:32:25] <Elon_Satoshi> Do you think onion domain encryption is better than https certs?
[01:32:47] <ms7821> it does depend a bit on scale but yeah, now LE supports DNS verification and wildcards there aren't many reasons not to use it
[01:33:39] <dostoyevsky2> ms7821: yeah, but for internal services you can't just run certbot for cert renewal... LE servers won't be able to access it from the outside
[01:34:19] <ms7821> that's where DNS01 comes in
[01:34:32] <ms7821> if you're spinning up lots of k8s clusters maybe you'd want to think about it
[01:35:45] <ms7821> Elon_Satoshi: because history as usual, and nah onion domains are pretty hard to remember and type

[01:40:15] <dostoyevsky2> Elon_Satoshi: If you think about it, most coins are also just some hash+algorithm and a protocol...  but if you make one mistake, the consequences are quite severe...
[01:41:03] <Elon_Satoshi> Don't most coin addresses nowadays have a checksum so that if you were to type them and make a typo, the address would be invalid?
[01:41:54] <Elon_Satoshi> And Monero uses something called OpenAddresses or something to attach addresses to DNS. You can type in "donate.getmonero.org" as a Monero address in most clients

[01:44:02] <Elon_Satoshi> Hmm... I think maybe it was called OpenAlias
[01:45:08] <Elon_Satoshi> Has the Tor Project considered making more rememberable onions possible?
[01:47:10] <iz> that's not a desired quality, it just derandomizes things
[01:47:46] <Elon_Satoshi> Ah
[01:48:26] <Elon_Satoshi> I suppose it's possible to just buy a normal domain and simply set it to redirecct to your onion address

[14:10:43] <Sofia> Hello world. A friend presented a simple substitution cipher puzzle from a game. I solved this and felt like making a similar but more difficult puzzle. IIRC such crackme challenges are not welcome in this channel (but the current topic and resource link do not indicate such restriction). I'd like to guage the difficulty of my challenge without presenting too many hints. Would anyone here be
[14:10:45] <Sofia> interested in such a puzzle? If this is not the place to present such a challenge, where should I?
[14:11:47] <riv> no that sounds fine for this channel

[17:57:08] <int-e> I even have a silly workflow for it where I transform the text to all upper case because emacs does matching in a semi-case-sensitive way by default (lower case matches either case; upper case matches only upper case)

[19:14:15] <Alipha> it was pretty easy if you ran it through an online substitution cipher solver and then fix up the results. though now i'm not entirely sure what the twist is (i think i have an idea of what it was though)
[19:17:57] <yawkat> i've made a simple message and encrypted it with a one-time pad, the twist may surprise you:  5581eda6565d47f28a95b6ab6717391f8242c05018b467cde428f7ef07eaf88c4f1759e925ace437b851d576b0fd409d57c375de9a732862c77b9546a9ef2f448a4ee31ae494a24aadd8e1a957c1dfb5474dc267df7a991856907c631e07

[19:56:31] <Sofia> Huh
[19:56:49] <Sofia> Almost decent.
[19:58:08] <Alipha> https://www.dcode.fr/monoalphabetic-substitution looks like it's on par also
[19:59:36] <Sofia> Both fail but partially decent.
[19:59:57] <Sofia> As for the twist, I think I can reveal now?
[20:00:38] <Haohmaru> is the plain text yet another ciphertext?
[20:00:49] <Sofia> No
[20:00:58] <Haohmaru> is that actually doable, btw?
[20:01:19] <Sofia> The solvers approximated it enough to almost read it but didn't do it well enough.
[20:01:32] <Sofia> They were random so aren't giving consistent results anyway.
[20:03:15] <Sofia> The top most common 4 characters had their frequencies halved by spreading their frequency over the 4 unused characters. These 4 top characters correspond to the top 42.9%. 
[20:03:59] <Sofia> So any solver which assumes a 1:1 mapping will fail. Any humans who look at the frequencies will notice the highest frequency is ~8% instead of the expected ~13% for the letter e.
[20:04:23] <Sofia> will likely*
[20:04:34] <Sofia> Assuming English.
