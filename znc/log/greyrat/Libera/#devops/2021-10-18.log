[12:37:09] <aruns> Hi all. I need to duplicate an EBS backed EC2 instance on AWS powering a live site, is creating an AMI image the way to go for this? If so, AWS documentation says that you can have an option called "No reboot" checked in order to avoid AWS powering down the EC2 instance from which you are generating the AMI, should I do this?

[13:21:21] <kwilczynski> aruns: You can create an AMI from root volume snapshot.
[13:21:30] <kwilczynski> aruns: Perhaps this will work for you.
[13:22:03] <kwilczynski> aruns: Taking a snapshot would not bring your currently running compute instance down.
[13:23:39] <kwilczynski> aruns: Mind you, if you end up bringing another instance up based on the root volume snapshot, you might need to do some clean-up to ensure that it comes up without issues - most of the time this means removing the udev configuration file that caches primary network card MAC address and such.
[13:24:01] <kwilczynski> aruns: Other than some things like that, this is pretty straight-forward.
[13:26:00] <aruns> "Taking a snapshot would not bring your currently running compute instance down."
[13:26:07] <aruns> You mean, provided No reboot is ticked kwilczynski 
[13:26:09] <aruns> Otherwise it will
[13:26:29] <kwilczynski> I assume you don't want to reboot anything?
[13:26:30] <aruns> I am pretty sure
[13:26:43] <aruns> Well, it's a running EC2 instance powering a live site
[13:26:56] <kwilczynski> Yes.
[13:26:57] <kwilczynski> :)
[13:27:22] <aruns> So I can either check No reboot (it looks like if there is any data corruption, it will only affect the new instance I am provisioning), or create the AMI out of hours
[13:27:46] <aruns> I might have to lean towards the former due to time constraints
[13:29:38] <kwilczynski> If this live system is heavily writing to the EBS volume it's using at the moment.
[13:29:56] <kwilczynski> The it might be better to wait to when you can do a small maintenance.
[13:30:17] <kwilczynski> Show compute down. Take a snapshot, and then bring it back up.
[13:30:31] <kwilczynski> And then you can fiddle with the snapshot as much as you like.
[13:31:51] <aruns> I don't think it's doing that much writing
[13:32:01] <aruns> It's a Laravel 6.20.4 site (MySQL DB)
[13:32:08] <aruns> And I think only the admins write to the DB
[13:32:20] <aruns> Don't think there are any scheduled tasks either
[13:32:24] <aruns> But will check
[13:32:40] <kwilczynski> Is the database living on the same compute?
[13:32:58] <kwilczynski> I am sure that something is reading/writing to it all the time, isn't it?
[13:33:07] <kwilczynski> With databases be careful. :)
[13:34:52] <kwilczynski> There is always a slight chance of EBS snapshot ending up being corrupted as the underlying volume has been written to, especially if there is a lot of I/O happening while snapshot is being taken.
[13:35:12] <kwilczynski> (which also might result in snapshot taking forever, so to speak)

[16:09:29] <aruns> Thanks kwilczynski 
[16:09:45] <aruns> Yeah, I think there are no external DBs
[16:10:11] <aruns> Ah I see, you've addressed my primary concern, thanks kwilczynski 
[16:10:47] <aruns> People said that No Reboot could lead to data corruption, but I wasn't sure whether they meant that the running target instance could be affected, or whether this would only affect the AMI
[16:12:37] <kwilczynski> ;)
[16:13:14] <aruns> But kwilczynski, I am correct in assuming there will be no downtime / otherwise adverse effects to the running EC2 instance if I use No Reboot, right??
[16:13:17] <aruns> *right?
[16:13:58] <aruns> I can always opt for a reboot and AMI build in the evening, should staging fail to successfully provision
[16:14:26] <aruns> I just want to confirm that No Reboot won't lead to any adverse impact as far as the running source instance is concerned
