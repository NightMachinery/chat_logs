[01:11:14] <greycat> sometimes you can just tell by looking at the version strings

[01:11:57] <PMT> apt does not directly keep that information; you could try to indirectly infer it by doing what greycat just suggested.
[01:12:35] <PMT> That will likely produce a superset though, since it'd also include packages no longer in the other repos that once came from them.

[01:15:14] <Azrael_-> if i just upgrade and run into problems with those packages. will i have problems to uninstall them during the upgrade?
[01:16:21] <greycat> it's impossible for us to answer that without (a) knowing what the packages are, and (b) having some experience with an upgrade with them in place
[01:18:52] <Azrael_-> php-packages of sury.org for 7.0-7.3. but i'm probably stressing my luck too far to hope for you being able to give me an answer :)
[01:19:34] <greycat> I can't answer that personally but sury's php packages are very popular, so someone else might know.
[01:19:54] <Azrael_-> then i'll stick around and perhaps reask tomorrow again
[01:19:58] <Azrael_-> thanks
[01:20:01] <maroloccio> greycat: my hunch was: try to avoid parsing output unless it's both machine parseable and abides to a stable contract; try instead discovering querying commands and arguments that allow fine-grained detection of different package install states
[01:20:43] <greycat> maroloccio: yeah, good policy in general, but when you look for "installed" in both dpkg(1) and dpkg-query(1) and find nothing useful, well...

[04:08:11] <RonWhoCares> Blondie101010: It won't upgrade the 92 packages
[04:08:29] <sney> have you run 'apt full-upgrade'?
[04:08:44] <RonWhoCares> No; Trying right now
[04:08:58] <sney> dselect: buster->bullseye
[04:08:59] <dselect> Read (at least) the upgrading chapter of <release notes> https://deb.li/39cyD . TL;DR: In /etc/apt/sources.list change "buster" to "bullseye", fix the line for security updates (see <bullseye-security>), remove stable-specific lines like buster-backports. apt update && apt upgrade && apt full-upgrade. 3rd party repos like <dmo> cause problems with upgrades. If working over ssh, upgrade ssh first, see <bullseye ssh upgrade>.
[04:09:03] <sney> it is in the instructions.
[04:09:22] <RonWhoCares> I did the security update.
[04:09:34] <RonWhoCares> This is my 4th server to be updating

[04:13:09] <sney> apt full-upgrade (aka dist-upgrade) is needed whenever you upgrade releases. if you didn't do it on your other machines, apt may still be in an incomplete state, even if it didn't show output like this.

[07:20:36] <wfpkhc> is there anyone here who is somewhat a semi offical person from debian?
[07:21:17] <wfpkhc> or am i on the wrong server?
[07:21:34] <xx> wfpkhc: some might hang around, but the official people are at OFTC
[07:21:40] <sney> IRC is not really used for direct feedback, if you have an issue you need to report then you should file a bug
[07:21:41] <xx> is there something specific you need?
[07:21:57] <wfpkhc> yes - https://i.imgur.com/oYUl1cI.png
[07:22:02] <somiaj> It is best to just ask your question or state your goal. We can at least point you in the right direciton.
[07:22:03] <xx> I have a debian sticker on my laptop, does that make me official?
[07:22:04] <wfpkhc> i found this after a search
[07:22:17] <wfpkhc> xx, you and apple apparently
[07:22:36] <wfpkhc> it was on a debian iso
[07:22:44] <xx> ignore it
[07:22:47] <sney> false positive
[07:23:35] <xx> "The file is too big" "REMOVE IT IMMEDIATELLY!!!!!!!"
[07:23:43] <wfpkhc> i would have called it a false positive by my word document this morning came up with a imotep.sb virus which i cleaned up
[07:23:46] <xx> what a useful software that Microsoft Security Essentials
[07:24:23] <sney> debian can't really do anything about what windows antivirus thinks of various files, anyway
[07:24:34] <wfpkhc> i know that
[07:24:47] <wfpkhc> just wanted to bring it to someones attention - makes me feel better

[17:28:57] <Haohmaru> yeah so the IDs are just an excuse
[17:29:08] <mihaiadrian> it really sucks. because telegram-cli is a massive, very complete interface written in C that takes a lot for someone to hold grasp of.
[17:29:50] <Haohmaru> so the CLI won't be able to show banners, thus CLI shall die
[17:30:09] <mihaiadrian> To cover its growing infrastructure costs, Telegram added sponsored messages (https://promote.telegram.org/) – a paid, privacy-friendly way to promote bots and channels. We are happy to see support for this has already been added across the majority of third-party apps.
[17:30:16] <mihaiadrian> We ask that you make sure that these sponsored messages are supported and properly displayed in your app by January 1, 2022.

[17:55:29] <dpkg> Use 'dpkg-reconfigure locales' to get it up and running.  This generates <locale> definitions and also edits /etc/default/locale which sets the $LANG environment variable at login time.  Use "LANG=C command" to change the output language for a one off command, ask me about <localised errors>.  See also <mac locales>.  http://wiki.debian.org/Locale
[17:56:02] <jelly> eggbean, also, you might want en_GB.UTF-8 instead of en_GB
[17:56:52] <jelly> en_GB is an 8-bit ISO8859-1 locale.
[17:57:04] <eggbean> jelly: sorry, I didn't mention it to make things easier to explain, but I am using cloud-init, so I think I just say en_GB for the module.

[17:59:23] *** Joins: zamuro (~Samantha@213.194.146.39)
[18:00:11] <jelly> eggbean, the bot told the answer.  if "locales" package is installed you need to tell the packaging system which locales you want compiled and available, that way
[18:00:15] <PerfDave> I think you should look at the description for locales-all TBH
[18:00:41] <PerfDave> "locales-all" contains pregenerated files for every supported locale; "locales" contains the tools for generating the ones you want.
[18:00:50] <jelly> locales-all is a nice hack if you don't want to deal with all the complexity of locales configuration

[20:36:21] <somiaj> Azrael_-: It can depend, how new are the sury packages? Uninstalling them and reinstalling them after could help things be smoother if that is a possiblity.
[20:38:34] <Azrael_-> somiaj: k, thanks. they are for php 5.6-7.3 (all versions). this is one of the full package names. all others are similar: 7.3.13-1+0~20191218.50+debian8~1.gbp23c2da
[20:40:42] <somiaj> Yea, if you don't mind uninstalling and reinstaling, might just be safest
[20:41:17] <Azrael_-> it will be just troublesome to fix all the php-versions and connections again after the upgrade. that's where i fear most of the downtime
[20:49:14] <randall> cosimone: AFAIR you can suggest non-free stuff, just not depends/recommend it. But easiest is to look it up in debian-policy
[20:49:42] <somiaj> I don't know the sury packages that well, but if they are fairly independent of the other debian packages (including their package name), they may not conflict, I'm just suggesting the method that would avoid any possible conflicts

[21:05:55] <fly_agaric> hello guys how can i expand root partition on a debian vm?
[21:06:05] <fly_agaric> its not LVM and i think iam fucked
[21:06:36] <Azrael_-> depends on how your debian vm accesses the disk. if it is a physical disk, then it'll get troublesome
[21:06:38] <fly_agaric> lsblk shows three partitions sda1, sda2 and sda5 and sda1 is root which I want to expand
[21:07:21] <fly_agaric> its not a physical disk its a "virtual disK" which is on a 3par storage
[21:07:34] <fly_agaric> vmdk file
[21:07:55] <Azrael_-> ok, not used to vmware that far
[21:07:59] <fly_agaric> i expanded the disk through vmware fdisk -l in debian shows that it now has 150gb instead of previous 100
[21:08:47] <fly_agaric> but then i wanted to expand with growpart and it says NOCHANGE: partition 1 could only be grown by 2046 [fudge=2048
[21:09:04] <Azrael_-> normally i'd say you'd have to move the partitions beside sda1 to the back and then you can expand sda1 but i've never seens how this would be possible in linux. perhaps sb else in here has an idea

[21:43:35] <jelly> fly_agaric, that's gparted, not gpart, and you can't do that online.  You will have to boot a livecd image with gparted, and then move other partitions to the end of the disk and then be able to extend sda1

[21:46:40] <jelly> fly_agaric, next time create VMs with LVM.  And no partitions.  Then you can extend online without reboot.
[21:46:44] <cosimone> this will do the job for such a small patch, though
[21:47:28] <jelly> Our VMs at work have one small disk just for /boot (or just for /boot and /boot/efi), and one or more large disks with lvm, not partitioned, lvm pv directly on whole disk
