[07:23:29] <aidalgol> twb: "A lightweight finger"  How was finger(1) bloated?
[07:23:53] <acdw> finger
[07:23:57] <acdw> fat fingers
[07:23:59] <twb> aidalgol: it has network protocol
[07:24:08] <twb> aidalgol: pinky is basically cat
[07:24:21] <aidalgol> oh
[07:24:26] <twb> the finger protocol is never used anymore because it's BY DESIGN an information leak
[07:24:32] <twb> *PII leak
[07:25:17] <twb> Like say you want to call a hospital and get a celebrity's patient record
[07:25:38] <twb> You do "pinky rms@mit.edu" which downloads everything about RMS from MIT.  Then you tell it to the receptionist and pretend to be his mum
[07:26:08] <twb> The receptionist goes "no one else would possibly know all that" and sends you the EPR and you learn how many times RMS has caught gonorrhea
[07:26:28] <acdw> at least 5
[07:26:35] <aidalgol> Question is: was this design naivety or hubris?
[07:27:40] <twb> aidalgol: it was before there was an internet
[07:28:02] <twb> aidalgol: back then when you got to school, they gave you a printed book of everyone student's name, room number, and photo

[18:36:24] <Common-Lisp> There was a whole kerfluffle about this, because the old renderer was (and is) much better than shr, but maitainability was an issue so the mu folks bit the bullet and deprecated it

[18:38:17] <Common-Lisp> In fact I think the issue was further upstream
[18:38:57] <Common-Lisp> Re-reading the relevant posts now, it seems like they were using html2text (the Emacs lisp implementation which is built-in)

[18:41:40] <Common-Lisp> BTW, there are other tricks to get around using shr in mu4e, it's actually pretty easy to use emacs-w3m as your renderer, or even X out to www-client/surf in your buffer.

[18:43:19] <Common-Lisp> That depends on what you expect from your email.
[18:44:05] <Common-Lisp> If you want it to work like Thunderbird or webmail (ie, allow network requests and in-line image embeds), figuring out how to get surf to render it is probably your best bet.
[18:44:09] <Common-Lisp> Some people are opposed to that, though
[18:44:46] <bremner> nothing is going to do a great job of rendering html in a terminal

[20:35:22] <Bayes> it seems that org-mode has its own built in "latex features" that are pretty barebone and not easily switchable to something more latex oriented like latex mode
[20:36:34] <corwin> Could be fertile ground for patches..
[20:36:40] <ngz> You can use a LaTeX mode to edit LaTeX snippets in Org.

[23:54:38] <zebrag> Any idea where to search for emacs not updating the kill-ring after org-protocol store-link, unless I do `C-k` or other emacs-to-emacs cut-and-past action, before
[23:55:06] <zebrag> it's quite hindering the workflow

[23:55:31] <thuna`> If you can reproduce it I would say do [M-x report-emacs-bug]
[23:56:04] <zebrag> hum, yeah, there is that too
[23:56:30] <zebrag> and my emacs is up-to-date now

[23:57:03] <thuna`> I think 27 and beyond is still supported?
[23:57:14] <thuna`> Don't quote me on that though
[23:57:33] <nij-> I'm on 27.2. This is the source code of org-protocol-store-link, https://bpa.st/ZI3A

[23:57:39] <zebrag> but it's always way better if you know what you're talking about before reporting a bug
[23:57:40] <nij-> which stores link into kill-ring correctly.
[23:57:45] <nij-> notice the #'kill-new
[23:57:59] <nij-> paste the source on your side
[23:58:10] <zebrag> hum
[23:58:57] <zebrag> nij-: well, I didn't write any code about that
[23:59:25] <zebrag> isn't it included in org-mode?
[23:59:26] <thuna`> zebrag: what version are you on?
[23:59:46] <zebrag> probably master, since I use straight
