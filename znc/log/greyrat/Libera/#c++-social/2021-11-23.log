[02:12:00] <random-jellyfish> freenode is gone dude
[02:12:13] <random-jellyfish> "Officially become digital territory of the Joseon Empire"
[02:12:24] <random-jellyfish> what the hell does that even mean?
[02:13:11] <random-jellyfish> whenever a dodgy dude takes over and yells "freedom to the people" you know it's gonna be a brutal dictatorship
[02:18:56] <Bakunin> hehe
[02:19:15] <Bakunin> There's a warlord in Haiti who has taken over big chunks of the capital.  His name is BBQ.
[02:19:26] <Bakunin> He runs a gang syndicate he calls the G9.
[02:19:44] <Bakunin> Had a twitter callin yesterday and a bunch of his victims phoned in to call him a pos
[02:20:27] <Bakunin> but in terms of Leenode, he probably had a bet that he could kill the biggest IRC network

[02:44:42] <Bakunin> a long and rambling call-in show
[02:45:06] <random-jellyfish> and people called in and he traced them?
[02:45:16] <Bakunin> no, they bitched at him, some of themn
[02:45:43] <random-jellyfish> and how did he react?

[17:45:46] <hinst> Or so the customer representative says we will see
[17:46:41] <hinst> I am not in the slightest surprised that it broke. Because data is stored twice in our system: once "normal" data and once more "summarized" per day in two tables
