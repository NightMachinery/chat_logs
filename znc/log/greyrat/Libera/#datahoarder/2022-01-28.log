[02:57:50] <evilgohan2> sorry, side note
[02:57:56] <evilgohan2> that horrible interview is now a meme.
[02:57:58] <unfinity> ・゜゜・。。・ ​ ゜゜\​_ø< qu​ack!
[02:57:59] <evilgohan2> my goodness.
[02:58:01] <evilgohan2> ,bef
[02:58:01] <unfinity> evilgohan2 you befriended a duck in 3.189 seconds! You have made friends with 204 ducks in #datahoarder.
[02:58:02] <joepie91> ,bef
[02:58:02] <unfinity> You tried befriending a non-existent duck. That's freaking creepy.
[02:58:03] <joepie91> ?
[02:58:16] <evilgohan2> I'm legitimately surprised you haven't heard about this
[02:58:24] <evilgohan2> Are you familiar with the subreddit /r/AntiWork?
[02:58:33] <joepie91> I've been ignoring most of the internet lately
[02:58:34] <joepie91> yeah
[02:58:38] <evilgohan2> That's fair.
[02:58:56] <evilgohan2> Okay, so, the now-former top mod of AntiWork got invited by FOX NEWS to do an interview and accepted.
[02:59:17] *** Quits: vil01 (~vilja@fwa5e16-76.bb.online.no) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[03:00:00] <evilgohan2> I hate to say it, but take all the stereotypes that people have about moderators on reddit and this person fit them. They were wholly unqualified and unprepared to partake in any televised interviews - especially a live one with a "News" agency that is the precise antithesis to whatever beliefs you espouse with regards to workers rights.
[03:00:25] <evilgohan2> In 3 minutes, they managed to decimate an entire movement.
[03:01:43] <joepie91> welp
[03:01:55] <joepie91> nobody thought to do press training?
[03:02:04] *** Joins: vil01 (~vilja@fwa5e16-76.bb.online.no)
[03:03:06] <evilgohan2> So, apparently, another mod has already given 4 other interviews as well. Said mod was self-described as "a 21 years old male, long-term unemployed and an Anarchist."
[03:04:24] <evilgohan2> This came out in a public statement they themselves made that was...
[03:04:28] <evilgohan2> Well, quite franky speaking, their writing in terms of grammar, sentence structure, spelling, and syntax was that of someone who was quite possibly a teenager.
[03:04:51] <evilgohan2> The fact that they all collectively got together, penned it, reviewed it, decided it was okay, published it, and then stickied it makes it that much worse.
[03:05:48] <evilgohan2> When it came to preparation for the interview, the person was described as having 1 hour of notice and "thinking of taking a shower".
[03:07:55] *** Quits: thevar1able (~textual@46.39.45.122) (Quit: thevar1able)
[03:08:25] <evilgohan2> So, no, joepie91: no one did press training and no one involved was qualified in any way to represent that movement.
[03:08:35] <joepie91> sigh
[03:08:40] <evilgohan2> This is about as good as a rundown as you're going to get on it: https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/sdesxw/megathread_rantiwork_goes_private_after_fox_news/

[03:10:47] <joepie91> (building raised planter boxes
[03:10:48] <joepie91> )
[03:10:55] <sarnold> oo fun

[03:11:06] <joepie91> project is 2 years delayed but hey :p
[03:11:17] <joepie91> also that setup is SO MUCH faster than manually fucking about with a jigsaw lol
[03:11:18] <skye0> evilgohan2 well we're fucked at this point
[03:11:20] <joepie91> to do cut-outs
[03:11:30] <skye0> i'm fucked too, my relationships seems to be declining and i'm struggling to get anything done some more
[03:11:49] <joepie91> put plank against jig, clamp, saw, de-clamp, flip around, clamp, saw, de-clamp, done
[03:12:28] <joepie91> the end goal is a sort of clone of https://media.vtwonen.nl/m/th25v6085rdn_large.jpg
[03:12:41] <joepie91> except with a different construction: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EY4zFcrXkAMsxpA?format=jpg&name=4096x4096
[03:12:54] <joepie91> (that was before working out how to make a smooth joint)
[03:13:30] <joepie91> so today I was making (some of) the interlocking cut-outs
[03:14:10] <ThePendulum> damn this murder investigation, they set up a fake task force to make the murderer feel proud and admit to the murders
[03:14:39] <joepie91> also my clone will be two planks deep instead of one
[03:14:45] <joepie91> so that I can plant stuff that needs more depth, like potatoes

[19:45:14] <ThePendulum> "in now over 10 years of age, the capacitors and board traces have well degraded"
[19:45:18] <ThePendulum> wat
[19:45:52] <ThePendulum> I don't think hard disk boards even have electrolytical capacitors
[19:46:14] <ThePendulum> and why would the traces degrade?
[19:47:27] <ThePendulum> not saying it's worth it but I wouldn't expect a new old stock drive from 2012 to last noticable shorter than one from 2022
[19:47:27] *** NeoThermic_III is now known as NeoThermic
[19:47:38] <NeoThermic> just like any trace, if stored in a shit way?
[19:47:39] <ThePendulum> at least not because of its age
[19:48:12] <NeoThermic> my main concern with new-old stock from 2012 would be infant mortality due to the drive not being spun up for so long
[19:48:19] <ThePendulum> yeah
[19:55:07] <NeoThermic> I also can't imagine that 2012-era drives could compete with newer CMR variants
[19:55:27] <NeoThermic> I mean, fuck, just in the lifetime of 8TB drives the cache has doubled on them
[19:58:49] <ThePendulum> I also thought they do state whether it's SMR or CMR now?
[19:59:00] <ThePendulum> idk if it's just a boycott
[19:59:00] <NeoThermic> yeah, so a Red+ 4TB has 128MB cache, whereas an old pre-2012 drive is gonna be under what, 32MB if lucky?
