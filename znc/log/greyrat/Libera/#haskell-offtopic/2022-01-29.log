[14:51:44] <[exa]> let's say I have a multiplayer chess-style game that players could literally play over mail (no hidden information, so at the worst you literally send board with the next move to the other player and make somehow sure that you only consider valid updates)
[14:53:31] <schuelermine> dminuoso: isn’t it also the case that "0" when coerced to a boolean is false? (In PHP)
[14:54:22] <[exa]> is there a library or something that would make the setup of the "infrastructure" for such game a bit easier? E.g., create a lobby channel on IRC that would get the messages from the game (or on a mailing list or signal whatever other chatty thing) and abstract it from the programmer in a reasonable way to only have operations like "view lobby", "invite", "join", "send action" etc?
[14:55:02] <geekosaur> not aware of one in haskell but you might look at dgamelaunch
[14:55:22] <geekosaur> was designed for nethack but also used by varuious other games
[14:56:04] <[exa]> like, I see I'd eventually reimplement it myself but saving me from wheel reinvention is also good
[14:57:28] <[exa]> how do you even do this from cell phones, like androids
[14:57:45] <[exa]> you can't rely on TCP connection holding there right?
[14:58:54] <geekosaur> right but if you're talking about email you're not demanding long term stateful connections anyway
[14:59:14] <geekosaur> you might use udp instead of tcp…
[14:59:15] <[exa]> yeah, not at all, kindof brainstorming so far
[14:59:41] <[exa]> the dgamelaunch looked like ssh-based, that's why I wondered about tcp stability
[14:59:45] <geekosaur> and looking over your specs again dgl is probably not what you want after all
[15:00:54] <geekosaur> the variant used by dcss has web lobby support but it's somewhat disjoint and may be most of the activity in hs communicating with dgl. in any case it won;'t help if your lobby is on irc
[15:01:27] <[exa]> not even sure if the lobby would be IRC, it just seems the most straightforward choice to me now :D
[15:02:42] <[exa]> anyway that's an idea from yesterday, I'll let this sink in
[15:02:45] <[exa]> :D
[15:13:58] <geekosaur> it's straightforward because there are plenty of libraries for it, but irc is a fairly heavyweight protocol not well suited to mobile devices; I'd go for a custom lightweight protocol
[15:14:31] <geekosaur> in particular connecting to an IRC server requires a lot of data exchange and callbacks
[15:14:56] <geekosaur> so unless there's a really big advantage to being able to monitor it from a normal IRC client I'd steer away from it
[15:18:49] <geekosaur> also the message length limit makes it a poor choice for transmitting boards
[15:19:57] <__monty__> #haskell-game might have more suggestions.
[15:28:18] <[exa]> hm true

[17:54:02] <Logio> [exa]: if your goal is that you could literally play it over mail, then why not just serialize the game state to ascii and use email then?
[17:54:39] <Logio> or even let players just copy and paste the state to <whatever>
[18:00:39] <[exa]> Logio: yeah except I'd like a bit of 2000ish user experience over that :D
[18:01:00] <[exa]> I was mostly trying to dodge the necessity to make my own game server etc
[18:02:00] <[exa]> actually just mailing the stuff around and maintaining a literal mailing list would work I guess, mail ain't that slow is it?
