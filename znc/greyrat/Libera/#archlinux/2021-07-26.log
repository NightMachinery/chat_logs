[01:15:25] <Shapeshifter> I'm using alsa with dmix such that the headphones and SPDIF use two different equalizer settings. It was a hassle to configure but it works perfectly. Unforuntalye, Steam via flatpak *requires* pulseaudio, without it, I get no sound. pulseaudio-equalizer is a pain, pulse in general is, never worked for me no matter what I tried. Do I have any other chance? Can I somehow wire flatpak audio into a 
[01:15:31] <Shapeshifter> sink or something so I can play it? Certainly this must be possible.

[13:58:31] <grawity> (the driver divides interval by /2, so wdctl still says "Timeout: 120" but starts counting down from 60... not great when systemd aims to ping it every 1/2)

[14:00:15] <luca020400> it does, but they removed the check for v1

[16:53:50] <Foxboron> diabonas: Standard microsoft is 2 certificates. I'm not sure if a secure boot enabled computer with a shim is going to record one or two entries?
[16:54:02] <Foxboron> i assume the same cert is going to be used for shim and oprom, thus creating one entry.
[16:54:27] <Foxboron> so only looking at pcr7 wouldn't give you much I believe? unless you enroll your own keys + microsoft.
[16:56:25] <diabonas> Foxboron: shim would be signed my the third-party CA, which is probably the same as the oprom, yes. I don't understand why you would boot with a shim if you want to use sbctl with your own keys though? again, you'd first enroll your own keys, plus the MS CA to be safe, then determine whether the MS one actually gets used during boot, and if it isn't, it can be removed again

[20:47:31] <lakiluki> also, when building the kernel, can I somehow create the initiral ramdisk to be used in a different environemnt, for example in qemu?
[20:48:05] <lakiluki> because I tried to spin up the arch qemu qcow with my host's kernel and initramfs and it can't mount the new root, saying it can't find /dev/sda2
[20:48:34] <lakiluki> and my end goal is to build the kernel on the Linode VPS for compilation times and then use that to debug parts of the kernel in qemu

[20:50:43] <lakiluki> that's pretty cool, I was struggling with this yesterday
[20:50:45] <lakiluki> thanks!
[20:51:22] <bin> so i dont think the 'w' key issue happens in the tty. it started happening again this morning and i dropped to the tty and it's not seeming to happen here which is very weird.
[20:51:39] <bin> idr who was here when i was first discussing that issue but it didnt happen at all for 3 days
[20:51:52] <grawity> if you're doing it manually with mkinitcpio -k -g, then add -A autodetect, or whatever the option for "skip this hook" was
[20:51:55] <bin> and then started up this morning after i opened my work chrome and had slack and gmail and all that shit running
[20:52:14] <bin> but then i closed all the browsers and it happened once, so i dropped to the tty (where i am now) and it's not happening
[20:52:48] <bin> wonder if it will keep happening here now that im back in x11
[20:53:06] <bin> or i wonder if it really is somehow weirdly related to whatever chrome is doing
[20:53:53] <lakiluki> grawity: i used the preset, but I'll definitely try doing it manually, seems easier

[23:17:12] <Repentinus> As safe as it is going to get with an AUR package.
[23:17:46] <Repentinus> Have linux and linux-lts installed with zfs-dkms (pro-tip, you can even get it from Eli's unofficial repo prepackaged).

[23:22:45] <Repentinus> If you run ZFS or btrfs without taking snapshots on upgrades, you might as well save yourself the bother and use XFS or ext4.
[23:23:20] <mullagain> well, thinking btrfs may be better supported?
[23:23:29] <Repentinus> It is.
[23:23:46] <MrElendig> being in kernel is a big advantage
[23:23:48] <mullagain> only problems is it looks like raid5/6 are poopy.
[23:24:00] *** Joins: Betal (~Beta@user/betal)
[23:24:00] <Repentinus> Unless you need/want ZFS native encryption or RAID5/6, you should use btrfs.
[23:24:25] <mullagain> is it possible to just run btrfs on top of mda?
[23:24:27] * MrElendig hopes for bcachefs revolution
[23:24:36] <Repentinus> Yes, but why would you?
[23:24:41] <mullagain> to get raid 5
