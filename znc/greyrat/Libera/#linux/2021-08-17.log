[00:05:23] <mcon> PaulFertser: First of all a generic question: is it better to start pppd from the same serial line I use for communication (modem style) or to launch from a separate terminal?
[00:05:27] <fakuve> Hey guys , whats up , upah!. I got a little problem with my clipboad integration. I normally use `tmux` to select a bunch of text and that should be fine . The issue is that the tmux buffer is getting all the text , whereas xclip is not getting all that text

[00:09:06] <PaulFertser> mcon: I would expect pppd started in regular shell to be printing all the PPP stuff and then you can exit picocom and start pppd on your host system with "debug" to see what packets it sees.
[00:09:07] <rascul> not sure why that would be, i can't replicate such behavior here
[00:09:37] <fakuve> yep I'm gonna troubleshoot it

[00:09:41] <fakuve> thanks rascul
[00:10:05] <rascul> i tried 'man xclip | xclip -i' and i got the whole man page of 5419 into the selection buffer
[00:10:33] <rascul> you're not mixing up selection buffer and clipboard are you?

[00:11:40] <mcon> PaulFertser: Ok. will do: login via serial line, "exec pppd", close terminal, launch pppd on server (ubuntu) side. Right?
[00:11:54] <PaulFertser> btw, wayland users, can you please tell if it has the same thing as "x11 primary selection" and "x11 clipboard" just differently named?
[00:12:20] <PaulFertser> mcon: yes, have you tried it already? Probably needs appropriate options so that it accepts the IP address.
[00:12:28] <uwharrie> https://www.jwz.org/doc/x-cut-and-paste.html
[00:13:02] <PaulFertser> mcon: guess it'll accept any address without options so worth a try that way I think.
[00:13:14] <mcon> PaulFertser: Yes, I tried, but it's worth to do it again in a "controlled way" ;)
[00:14:07] <PaulFertser> mcon: you should see pppd start printing "ppp stuff" with {{{ brackets etc. Then you exit picocom, start pppd instead and see.

[01:47:37] <PaulFertser> mcon: you make a script that starts local pppd, and it'll start chat because your script will have it in "connect" option.

[02:54:25] <Psi-Jack> NAT is the whole NAT shebang.

[02:59:39] <Dagmar> PaulFertser: I would stick with routing, but you're also sort of ignoring the presence of either a protocol gateway, or being f**ked for communications coming from IPv4 hosts
[02:59:45] <Dan39> Guest78: what about speech to text? i don't know if that is buult in though
[02:59:45] <koala_man> Guest78: for accessibility reasons or what?

[03:00:20] <Dan39> no idea
[03:00:26] <Dan39> is there even a good one for linux?
[03:00:37] <Dagmar> That stuff sort of doesn't really happen under Linux outside of leveraging Google services
[03:00:46] <Dagmar> All the solutions that are available are kind of horrible
[03:00:55] <PaulFertser> Dagmar: without going proper dual stack you'd be either ignoring IPv4 hosts or IPv6 hosts. When you suggest someone to connect a board to the Internet with NAT for IPv4 you'd be making it impossible to talk to "the other Internet" which is IPv6.

[06:48:28] <Psi-Jack> It's pretty direct in meaning at leastr.
[06:48:31] <Fohsap> So basically all modern software devs would start including that library, and 'save settings' would be like 'save settings to UniCloud'

[07:28:38] <[[R]]> pnbeast: yeah, i can't help it i'm so massive
[07:28:51] <schuelermine[m]> all compression algorithms only reduce the file size sometimes
[07:28:57] <neshpion> [[R]]: i guess the input i gave it was so small that its compressed size *plus whatever header boilerplate the zip format has* turned out to be bigger
[07:28:58] <rascul> try gzipping a one byte file
[07:29:03] <rascul> it grows in size!

[07:29:23] <Ps2-Jack> It's funny. I can actually see when schuelermine is typing while looking at matrix. :)
[07:29:29] <neshpion> the base64 of this is smaller than `gzip -c | base64`
[07:29:56] <schuelermine[m]> all compression algorithms only reduce the size of some files
[07:29:56] <schuelermine[m]> because otherwise, some files wouldn’t be processable at all, or some compressed files would be ambiguous

[12:25:13] <ShapeShifter499> I was wondering, does anyone here have any suggestions on what I should do to manage a group of computers I'm using sort of as a cluster?  I'd like to make sure it's encrypted since it's a home cluster and there's no way I can ensure it won't be stolen at any point. Normally I'd just encrypt one computer and deal with that. But is there a better way than encrypting each computer individually and then decrypting each
[12:25:13] <ShapeShifter499> individually every time I need to reboot?
[12:25:47] <Sauvin> Helenah, "never mind", not "nvm". Non-volatile memory has nothing to do with it.

[12:53:13] <DLange> that was a big thing a decade or two ago but these days people use distributed microservices
[12:53:32] <xinming> these days, I'm doing experiments on brd module, which exports portion of ram as block device, and I export that ram disk as iscsi, and then I joint several ram0 disk to be a large ram disk with 10G nic.
[12:53:40] <akik> xinming: mosix/openmosix
[12:54:03] <xinming> then I found that enable multipath + another 10G port, I can extend the bandwitdh to 20G

[12:55:26] <xinming> akik: Ok, thanks
[12:55:42] <xinming> DLange: Ok, I thought we have linux support that feature already.
[12:55:48] <DLange> xinming: every touched byte would then need to travel over your network for each CPU instruction
[12:56:08] <DLange> not very efficient, this is why people use higher level libraries for such computing tasks

[16:20:15] <gtz> RayTracer, no i don't have such a program...
[16:20:18] <clarity> I don't think there is such a statistic, but I'm happy to be proven wrong
[16:21:02] <gtz> It would be useful to get a ballpark estimate of the load that a process is causing to the database server.
[16:21:09] <RayTracer> I was also thinking that's a request for a nonexisting stat
[16:21:21] <abiliomarques> in the meantime (compiling) does anyone know about the kernel emulating instructions? last week I found that musl uses rdhwr dest, $29 , which is emulated by the kernel. This is not uncommon (uclibc and glibc do it too), but uclibc always uses $3 as dest ... and that makes it fast. Digging about it, I found a note from the early 2000s saying that using $3 as destination makes it go through the "fast" emulation path, and that
[16:21:21] <abiliomarques> everything else will be slow
[16:21:59] <abiliomarques> it made me curious about "fast" v. "slow" emulation path. Is there anywhere I can read about it?

[16:28:37] <RayTracer> (a programmatic approach could use the iftop sources and filter for those)
[16:28:49] <rascul> it could also help to use a network namespace to isolate the net stats

[17:52:43] <ikonia> it normally says what version of the kernel is required
[17:53:02] <acovrig> what is swap used for on a server, I was picturing swap mostly being used to "extend" ram to the slow disk (like the windows paging file) and to dump ram to disk to hibernate
[17:53:28] <ikonia> acovrig: it can be useful to swap out sleeping processes, it can be used in maintienance tasks for example
[17:53:30] <akik> acovrig: it doesn't matter if you're using a server or workstation
[17:53:46] <SkunkyLaptop> acovrig: linux doesn't like it if there's NO swap.  but if you've lots of ram, and you give it a LITTLE swap, that'll make it happy.
[17:54:05] <lopid> something about the kernel caching efficiency with no swap present. i've seen systems with no swap just freeze, where i suspect with *some* swap i'd have been at least given some chance at recovery

[17:58:28] <dminuoso> acovrig: and `available`?
[17:58:51] <dminuoso> as long as there's `free`, there's strictly speaking no need to swap out memory. but linux heuristics might do it anyway
[17:59:00] <acovrig> I have 2 nodes with 0B swap used, 1 with 86G used, 1G free (125G total) which is kinda interesting

[19:32:35] <xoval> i never really ssh'd into a system with other people so i never needed a use for that
[19:32:44] <xoval> thx :D
[19:32:52] <Adoi> is there anyone without psychotic issues who can help me, like it used to be "long ago" in this channel?

[19:35:37] <testest> This is my first time on IRC, so here is the question, can I join a channel on other server where as I am not regsitered there?

[19:35:37] <testest> thanks :)
[19:35:37] <ananke> Adoi: I mentioned multiple things, but you seem to have ignored all of them. so perhaps rather than complaining about lack of support, you could focus on the actual problem and factual data
[19:35:37] <ananke> paulcarroty: neat project, though clearly not something that solves xoval's problem.
[19:36:05] <xoval> paulcarroty: i was trying that before, it's kind of weird and i'm really dumb so i couldn't figure it out

[20:09:09] <TomyWork> ayecee, oh well if they abuse non-SIGUSR signals for custom stuff, that would explain it too

[20:11:04] <drip> i would make sure the name of the site resolves to what its supposed to.  httpd should at least accept the connection (unless 'unable to connect' is the website displaying an error)
[20:11:13] <MrFooBar> then you should start checking php versions for that one
[20:11:21] <MrFooBar> does that cms have any kind of log to debug it?
[20:11:22] <ayecee> drip: that is what it sounds like
[20:11:29] <TomyWork> firewall?
[20:11:37] <ayecee> drip: would be good to clarify that
[20:11:42] <TomyWork> the new debian version might have stricter firewall defaults
[20:11:53] <Adoi> MrFooBar, doesnt seem to have a log

[20:12:27] <cadmio> n4dir: and the display manager automatically starts up Icewm?

[20:12:40] <jochum> Adoi: fpm or builtind libapache2-mod-php ?
[20:12:43] <uwharrie> Did you ever figure out which CMS you were running, where its config lived, or what PHP engine it was using?
[20:13:02] <cadmio> guest856: I don't understand if the display manager is needed to start the WM
[20:13:03] <Adoi> jochum, the latter, I remember having installed it yesterday
[20:13:11] <n4dir> cadmio: if you confiugure it accordingly. A quick web-search seems to show "lightdm" would do it (and it wasn't an unusual display-manager, but i lost contact to that subject)

[20:15:25] <guest856> cadmio: I am not sure about the differences between the display manager and the window manager; then I just use the default system to login and, then, I set a new window manager (KDE, GNOME, etc.) if I need it, afterwards
[20:15:49] <n4dir> cadmio: btw, in my humble opinion, icewm is a good choice, though its been ages i heard someone mention it

[20:49:45] <Guest1134> I have lost my ext4 /home to fsck taking forever to fix the filesystem(and not throwing any errors, nor using any cpu nor being wait%procented); all because I assume I used parted instead of gparted/fdisk/cfdisk to resize my partition table :^)
[20:49:52] <TJ-> esselfe: that is not what I mean - in the remote host, PAM is doing hostname resolving (probably of its own name) and timing out

[22:15:45] <esselfe> yes all backups from other machines, but I moved them to a dir in ~/.ssh
[22:16:04] <MrElendig> superboot: check what other network manager/service is running
[22:16:08] <Psi-Jack> esselfe: Try specifying the /exact/ needed key for the user with `ssh -i file ...`
[22:16:27] <esselfe> id_rsa right?
[22:16:30] <esselfe> not .pub
[22:16:32] <Psi-Jack> esselfe: What's happening is you're trying to send likely every key under the sun, and after a number of times, it will reject.
[22:16:36] <Psi-Jack> Yes, the private key.
[22:16:58] <esselfe> same error
[22:17:26] <superboot> MrElendig: Ah, Ok. Thanks. I figured it out. I had to "apply the changes" of removing the netplan.yaml config file. Thanks.
[22:17:33] <esselfe> I wish there would be a .db file to just delete
[22:17:36] <Psi-Jack> esselfe: Are you sure that's the correct key then, to the correct user? 😉
[22:17:51] <Psi-Jack> esselfe: And, do you by chance have ssh-agent running and are any keys loaded into that?
[22:17:55] <esselfe> yes, the same key works on my other server
[22:18:18] <esselfe> and it's in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the DO server
[22:18:25] <TJ-> superboot: the reason for that is netplan writes systemd.network configs to /run/systemd/network/
[22:18:27] <Psi-Jack> esselfe: ssh-add -l    -- Anything?
[22:18:28] <uwharrie> could something have triggered sshguard on your username?
[22:18:32] <esselfe> no ssh-agent, just this new droplet-agent
