[02:44:24] <bn_work> Anyone have thoughts on using GH's "Merge" button (selecting rebase) vs just doing it via git locally?
[02:45:45] <BtbN> Thoughts?
[02:45:57] <bn_work> yes, on using one vs the other
[02:46:04] <BtbN> Why would it matter?
[02:46:22] <BtbN> I doubt Github does anything else in the background anyway
[02:46:41] <bn_work> does it?  I don't usually handle merging so wasn't sure 🤷
[02:47:15] <BtbN> What else would it do? It's the same git and repo
[02:47:25] <bn_work> (there was some recent post/complaint by Linus how GH's merge algo is "garbage" so thought I'd ask :) )
[02:48:16] <BtbN> What about it is garbage? Spamming Merge-Commits is annoying, but you're using Rebase anyway?
[02:48:23] <nedbat> bn_work: Linus is very opinionated.  Plenty of people use the merge button with no ill effects
[02:48:49] <bn_work> so _are_ GH's merge algo different that git's?
[02:48:56] <bn_work> algo(s)?
[02:48:59] <BtbN> What "merge algo" is there?
[02:49:11] <BtbN> It just takes the commits, rebases them, and then ff-merges them
[02:49:14] <bn_work> there are a bunch
[02:49:19] <BtbN> there is no great algorithm involved
[02:49:35] <mannequin> do you know how to welcome putin?
[02:49:37] <nedbat> bn_work: are you talking about merge or rebase?
[02:49:44] <nedbat> mannequin: please keep it on-topic
[02:49:50] <mannequin> k
[02:50:56] <bn_work> nedbat:  is rebasing not considered a type of merging?
[02:51:20] <nedbat> bn_work: it doesn't create a merge commit.  merging does.
[02:51:24] <bn_work> one "replays" one's commits on top but it's reconciling two different "lines of evolution"
[02:52:06] <bn_work> nedbat:  yes, so back to the question, are GH's merge algo(s) different?
[02:52:13] <BtbN> A Rebase-Merge is just a merge without creating a merge commit. i.e. git merge --ff-only
[02:52:34] <BtbN> Obviously only works if the commits apply cleanly, i.e. are rebased
[02:52:43] *** Quits: vicfred (~vicfred@user/vicfred) (Quit: Leaving)
[02:52:44] <nedbat> bn_work: back to your original question. you said, "selecting rebase".  Which green GitHub button are you talking about? Merge or Rebase?
[02:53:33] <bn_work> BtbN: are you sure that's FF if there are changes in both "branches"?  I thought that isn't considered "FF" in that case?
[02:53:48] <BtbN> That's where the rebase comes in.
[02:53:52] <nedbat> bn_work: do you know the difference between merging and rebasing?
[02:54:22] <bn_work> nedbat:  I believe so, did you see my comment above?
[02:56:35] <nedbat> bn_work: i've seen all the comments.  a rebase could produce conflicts that have to be resolved.

[03:01:15] <nedbat> bn_work: to go all the way back to your question: don't worry about what Linus says.
[03:01:57] <bookworm> well, it pays to listen actually

[03:02:44] <bookworm> and his remarks, assuming we're talking about the same rant, was that the *merge commits* end up bad because they don't contain useful information... mostly because it doesn't encourage good merge messages and just ends up with "merged x into y"
[03:03:02] <bn_work> huh?  why not value the opinions of the original git author?  lol
[03:03:12] <bookworm> and if he doesn't like something it's merges that don't contain information why they are necessary or what they do
[03:03:21] *** Joins: Visne (~Visne@dhcp-077-248-174-092.chello.nl)
[03:03:44] <bn_work> bookworm: yeah, that's what I'm thinking too, I didn't read the whole thing but it seems to be in the news everywhere recently.  Here's one post on reddit about it:  https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/pjggh0/linus_github_creates_absolutely_useless_garbage/
[03:03:48] <bookworm> it also doesn't make it in any way feasible to comment on commit messages / merge messages last I checked
[03:04:34] <bookworm> bn_work: it's a ... ~20ish line email... you'd be faster reading that than the reddit comments
[03:05:42] <bn_work> Are these CLI instructions wrong if I'm doing a "merge-rebase"? (as labeled by GH)  I don't even see the `rebase` command?? https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/3OLeU26k/github_merge_or_rebase_text.png
[03:07:33] <bookworm> I'd argue that you shouldn't be doing a back merge of develop into feature
[03:07:48] <bookworm> also, just checkout develop and git pull --rebase will do the trick
[03:08:27] <bookworm> (with the appropriate target ref)
[03:08:46] <bn_work> bookworm: huh?  it's the reverse?  I'm feature `/feature/...` into `develop`
[03:09:04] <bn_work> s/I'm feature/I'm (rebase) "merging"/
[03:09:07] <bn_work> blah, can't type
[03:09:15] <bookworm> step1 of the thing you pasted above
[03:09:26] <bookworm> not sure why you'd want to do it the way the suggest
[03:10:13] <bn_work> bookworm: right, so again, I ask are the CLI instructions it produces wrong?
[03:10:25] <bn_work> sounds like it?
[03:10:26] <bookworm> depends on what you want it to do
[03:10:53] <bookworm> step2 up there will fail if a fast-forward is not possible
[03:10:59] <bookworm> it won't actually rebase anything at all
[03:11:08] <bn_work> now that PR comments are resolved, I want to rebase this `/feature/...` branch (which was made off `develop`) back onto `develop`
[03:11:31] <bookworm> yes, so checkout feature, git rebase develop + force push
[03:11:38] <bookworm> GH may or may not allow that
[03:11:48] <bookworm> depending on your branch protection settings
[03:12:02] <bn_work> eh, force push, isn't that generally bad?
[03:12:17] <bookworm> if you don't want to rewrite history, you can't use rebase
[03:12:38] <bn_work> but those commits don't exist in develop yet
[03:13:04] <bookworm> then you don't need the force push, just checkout develop and merge the feature branch in that you've just rebased
[03:13:20] <bn_work> AIUI, with rebasing I should get those commits from featureX into develop with proper messages but different commit hashes, I believe?
[03:13:36] <bookworm> s/into/onto/
[03:13:37] <bookworm> but yes
[03:14:07] <bn_work> I already have develop locally, I've been maintaining that
[03:14:40] <bn_work> it's a bit ahead now of featureX but in different areas, and I assume no conflicts (assuming GH's message is to be trusted)
[03:15:17] <bookworm> --ff-only will yell at you if it can't do it, that's the point of using the option
[03:15:29] <bookworm> default is try ff, if that fails fall back to merge
[03:15:55] <bookworm> that's assuming you didn't set the corresponding merge config settings that flip that behavior
[03:16:06] <bn_work> do I have a ff situation?  I thought once there are divergent evolutions from a common ancestor that's no longer a "FF"?
[03:16:16] <bookworm> I mean, just play around with it? Not like you can really do any harm
[03:17:28] <bn_work> eh, what, lol, I already experienced lots of pain having to clean up divergent merges the other night, I'd rather do it correctly the first time if possible
[03:17:42] <bookworm> say you have [develop] with A --> B --> C, [feature] with D --> E --> F, on develop you now add commits, you end up with A --> B --> C --> G --> H, if you checkout feature and rebase onto develop you end up with A --> B --> C --> G --> H --> D --> E --> F
[03:18:07] <bookworm> if you then feature (the rebased one) into develop, that'll be a fast forward merge
[03:18:26] <bookworm> no matter that the original branching point was somewhere else, you *moved* the branching point to the tip
[03:18:59] <bn_work> in your ex:  when were develop and feature branched off?
[03:19:28] <bookworm> develop doesn't matter and assume the divering point was C for feature
[03:20:04] <bn_work> "feature (the rebased one) into develop" ... not following there... you mean merge?
[03:20:11] <bookworm> so feature prior to the rebase looked like  --> B --> C --> D --> E --> F,
[03:20:19] <bookworm> yes, missed the verb there
[03:20:49] <bookworm> so feature prior to the rebase looked like  A --> B --> C --> D --> E --> F *
[03:21:40] <bookworm> _osse has shiny ascii graphics, with me it's all single line I'm afraid ;)
[03:21:46] <rewt> ff merge `feature` into `develop` means `develop` must be an ancestor of `feature`, and will just bring `develop` up to `feature`... if they diverged, ff is not possible, and `feature` must first be rebased on `develop` in order to ff merge
[03:23:13] <bn_work> ok, so right now the two "branches" are:   https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/GcZu9Byv/tree_current_vs_desired.txt
[03:23:36] <bn_work> I thought rebase would give L12?
[03:23:53] <bn_work> (& I'm assuming "cherrypick" would give L8?)
[03:24:13] <bookworm> no, rebase would give you A B C D E
[03:24:29] <bookworm> well, assuming you don't re-arrange the commits in an interactive rebase
[03:24:55] <bookworm> you *can* use rebase for various things, one being re-parenting and one being commit reshuffling among other things
[03:25:20] *** Quits: BtbN (btbn@ffmpeg/developer/btbn) (Remote host closed the connection)
[03:25:25] <bookworm> cherry pick is something else entirely and leaves the original branch alone, while rebase modifies it
[03:25:51] <bn_work> bookworm: even if D & E occur afterwards?  notice the spacing on L4 to indicate rough commit "times"
[03:25:52] <bookworm> as in, if you are on feature and rebase onto develop, you modify feature
[03:26:12] <bn_work> I thought rebase arranges by committer date by default?
[03:26:18] <bookworm> bn_work: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing try this
[03:26:25] <bookworm> colorful pictures might help
[03:26:34] <rewt> when you rebase, all commits that get a different new parent are rewritten (as well as all their descendants), so your example, you can get A->B->D'->C'->E', but easier to get A->B->C->D'->E'
[03:27:17] <rewt> the actual time of commit doesn't really matter;  the order of commits, and which branch they're on, is what really matters
[03:28:00] *** Joins: BtbN (btbn@ffmpeg/developer/btbn)
[03:28:02] <bn_work> rewt: when you say "doesn't matter", are you saying to git?  GH?  or you mean as a general rule one should follow?
[03:28:03] <bookworm> generally I wouldn't think of it as time, but rather as a graph
[03:29:08] <bn_work> well, my point is D occurred after B and E occurred after C, that's all I was trying to indicate on L4.  If I can preserve that ordering, great
[03:29:10] <rewt> in general... each 'branch' is a series of commits, and rebasing just means move "this series" to be after "that series"
[03:29:18] <bn_work> (I'm assuming that's more helpful?  not sure)
[03:30:08] <rewt> generally order across branches never matters, since they're distinct changes
[03:31:31] <bn_work> I wonder if having them grouped together may be better... since rebasing will make it look like one linear stream it may be harder to determine what was going on if they get interleaved with develop commit messages (although mine tend to be very specific so I always know what's going on)
[03:31:39] <rewt> other than metadata recording the time, there is nothing to indicate which is first across branches... but within a branch, each commit points to its parent(s)
[03:32:40] <bn_work> basically once I rebase if featureX had a commit message that was "fixed widget foo", that's all that I'll get post-rebase I'm assuming (unless I prefix all his messages with "PR1:  "  or something helpful?)

[03:41:40] <bn_work> (if the commit messages weren't updated, ex:  prefixed with "PR#: " then I'd agree grouping them together is probably better)
[03:41:56] <bn_work> so one knows what's going on
[03:43:14] <rewt> well, feature branches are usually for working on one feature, so you'd want all commits relating to that feature after each other, so you can view them as a whole; even do a git diff of where the changes start to where the changes end, to get a picture of everything that was changed for that feature
[03:43:27] <bn_work> rewt: also, if I just did `git checkout feature; git rebase develop`, would that merge that based on the timestamps, or I guess based on what you said earlier it sounds like it'll just plop D -> E as D' -> E' after C on develop?

[05:04:49] <nik3daz> Hey all! Random developer on Chromium here.
[05:04:50] <nik3daz> We have a git extension tool that we use to help manage large chains of branches. It lays out all your branches by their upstreams, and helps keep track of how up to date everything is.
[05:04:50] <nik3daz> https://i.imgur.com/SNysl8g.png
[05:04:51] <nik3daz> I was wondering if there was any interest/opposition to me upstreaming this tool into git proper, e.g as `git branch --tree` or something.

[05:11:43] <nedbat> nik3daz: it looks cool. what determines the indentation?
[05:12:33] <nedbat> nik3daz: before trying to upstream it into git, how about making it available as an extension?
[05:12:53] <nik3daz> nedbat: any docs on how to do that?
[05:13:23] <bn_work> I wonder if I'm thinking of this incorrectly, I've rebased featureX's commits locally in order to make it amenable to "merging" so now when I do `git checkout develop` again then `git merge feature`, that merges, then I switch back `git checkout feature` then `git reset --hard <last_commit_before_rebase>` to ensure his branch doesn't get fubar-ed when I ultimately do a `git push`?
[05:14:19] <nedbat> nik3daz: i don't know of any docs. However you can package it up as git-map-branches should work
[05:14:43] *** Joins: k8yun (~k8yun@user/k8yun)
[05:14:55] <nedbat> nik3daz: what does the indentation mean?
[05:15:01] <nik3daz> nedbat: it indents 1 level each time you have a child branch
[05:15:02] <nik3daz> e.g
[05:15:02] <nik3daz> if A has children AA and AB
[05:15:03] <nik3daz> AA has children AAA and AAB
[05:15:03] <nik3daz> then output is
[05:15:04] <nik3daz> A
[05:15:04] <nik3daz> --AA
[05:15:05] <nik3daz> ----AAA
[05:15:05] <nik3daz> ----AAB
[05:15:06] <nik3daz> --AB
[05:15:17] <nik3daz> uh, that last one was meant to say AAB, some weird replacement thing happened lol
[05:15:23] <nedbat> nik3daz: for example: https://github.com/tummychow/git-absorb
[05:15:37] <nedbat> nik3daz: how does a branch have a child?

[05:18:11] <nik3daz> nedbat: we commonly stack many branches in Chromium because each local branch represents one Changelist (i.e actual commit) onto the main Chromium tree. Therefore, managing dependent Changelists is an exercise in managing dependent branches

[05:21:44] <bn_work> nedbat: oh, I was talking to myself earlier above, so I ended up just doing a `git fetch`, `git checkout feature`, `git rebase -i develop`, (r)eword-ed all the commits in that branch to just prefix the messages to be more meaningful post-merge
[05:22:04] <nedbat> bn_work: are other people using your branch?
[05:22:22] <bn_work> nedbat: only this 1 feature branch to initially create this feature

[05:22:42] <nik3daz> nedbat: so, if you type `git pull`, the upstream branch is where commits will get pulled down from. if if you have 'autosetupmerge = true' in your config, when you `git checkout -b <NEW_BRANCH>`, it will set the upstream of the new branch to your current branch. so in this way, branches form their own dependency tree.
[05:22:43] <nedbat> bn_work: if you coordinate with them, it could be ok
[05:23:00] <bn_work> I just want ensure they can do a FF and not have to be like "what happened to my commits?"
[05:23:00] <nedbat> nik3daz: i see
[05:23:37] <nik3daz> nedbat: we then make multiple indepedent commits to each branch, which puts them ahead/behind of their parents, and it's useful to be able to see that, and pull upstream changes as necessary =)

[07:10:27] <ldericher> fling, I use `gitg` from time to time, but mainly either `git adog` (`git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph`) or the graph view integrated in the Gitea web interface

Using git log and checking out the dates didn't work, meaning the forker probably checked it out, deleted the .git and waited

[08:57:36] <machinehum> You're right
[08:57:53] <parsnip> log base 2 of 80,000 is 16. manual git bisect would take 16 steps
[08:59:28] <parsnip> hmm, i might be misusing this calculator
[08:59:57] <parsnip> or you could slice at 1/3 and 2/3, always heading to the smaller diff, then recurse
[09:00:53] <parsnip> if your automation turns out to be slow from some reason, in computation, these bisections would be much faster
[09:01:07] <parsnip> but maybe a little tricker to implement.
[09:01:16] <parsnip> can git bisect work in thirds?

[18:55:32] <goblin> hello, I need some help with submodules. I git-clone'd https://github.com/Heltec-Aaron-Lee/WiFi_Kit_series, edited .gitmodules to change the broken LittleFS thing so it looks like this: https://pastebin.com/SHSQWy7y , but after running `git submodule update --init --recursive` I'm still getting `fatal: No url found for submodule path 'esp8266/libraries/LittleFS/lib/littlefs' in .gitmodules`
[18:55:45] <osse> anddam: the parent repo always dictates what *precise commit* the submodule is supposed to be at.
[18:55:50] <osse> git submodule update makes it so
[18:55:59] <osse> should really happen automatically, if you ask me
[18:56:11] <goblin> I've no idea where it gets the string `esp8266/libraries/LittleFS/lib/littlefs` from, grep only finds it in the `.git/index` binary file, and that directory is empty

[20:26:44] <OnlineCop> The PS1 bug TL;DR is that some of the color escape sequences are not wrapped in `\[` ... `\]` so Ctrl+R'ing (up Up-arrow'ing) through history can show artifacts, and I wanted to provide a PR to include them.
[20:28:59] <bn_work> what is the difference between git checkout foo and git switch foo?

[20:30:58] <ikke> bn_work: git switch is a newer command which got extracted from git checkout (together with git restre)
[20:31:24] <ikke> People found git checkout confusing because it can be used to both move to a new branch, and to put files in the working direcotry
[20:31:50] <ikke> so switch was added to just determine the current branch, and restore to manipulate individual files
[20:32:19] <bn_work> !git restre
[20:32:45] <bn_work> ?
[20:32:51] <ikke> man git restore
[20:32:51] <gitinfo> the git-restore manpage is available at https://gitirc.eu/git-restore.html
[20:33:43] <bn_work> ah, there was an `o` missing there :)
[20:33:51] <ikke> and the syntax is different

[20:34:20] <ikke> man git

[22:48:12] <Guest25> Hi. I've never used 'git' before. My reason for using it, is to simply download source code to build packages that aren't available in my distro's repo. Is there a 'best practice' in relation to where such source code is cloned? Should it go into '/usr/src' or 'usr/local/src', for example? Or should I be saving it into my home directory?
[22:48:40] <mackerman> Guest25: no, git does not care
[22:48:51] <ikke> but your homedir makes most sense
[22:49:05] <OnlineCop> The source code usually doesn't go into `/usr` directly; most of the time, you save it to the home directory, and if it wants to install some of the headers/libraries, those will make it into the `/usr` directories at that stage.
[22:49:29] <mackerman> In general writing to  /usr is privilaged, so somewhere like your home allows it as a regular user

[22:50:45] <Guest25> mackerman ikke OnlineCop thanks. so cloning to say, my downloads folder under my home directory makes most sense. thank you all.

[22:52:23] <mackerman> Linux FHS specs suggest to *not* build software under /usr,  as it is otherwise the system data directory,  and some temporary space would be better
