[04:56:57] <germ> Gentlemen, I am now reproducing locally the issue of my friend! I cloned his account, and effectively I do not see message that have been sent while he was disconnected
[04:58:33] <MetaNova> [[Multiple_clients]]
[04:58:33] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Multiple_clients
[04:58:46] <germ> he has!
[05:01:05] <germ> I can see his clients
[05:03:07] <MetaNova> so
[05:03:33] <MetaNova> your friend doesn't see the buffer they expect, and you claim they configured multiclients already
[05:03:37] <MetaNova> is that right?
[05:05:34] <germ> yes
[05:05:42] <germ> I have it all here, running wrong
[05:05:46] <MetaNova> terrific
[05:05:50] <germ> (wrong: to me)
[05:06:05] <MetaNova> are you the admin or are they?
[05:06:49] <germ> I am!
[05:06:55] <MetaNova> great
[05:06:57] <germ> Only good news :]
[05:07:10] <germ> I can even stream it on twitch if you want ;p
[05:07:13] <MetaNova> that means the burden of troubleshooting and proof of configuration is on you
[05:07:25] <MetaNova> follow https://wiki.znc.in/Multiple_clients#Full_overview step by step and show me the results of each command you issue
[05:07:30] <germ> totally: I am the host, a poor one at that!
[05:07:32] <MetaNova> make it one big paste
[05:09:19] <germ> So , I have multiclient! it works for me
[05:09:34] <germ> perhaps I need to load the module for him though one sec
[05:09:47] <MetaNova> germ: you will note
[05:09:55] <MetaNova> (I even made them bold)
[05:10:04] <MetaNova> step 1 needs to be done for each network, for each user
[05:10:09] <MetaNova> step 2 needs to be done for each user
[05:10:17] <germ> Right right let me go down through that
[05:10:18] <MetaNova> step 4 needs to be done for each network, for each user
[05:10:28] <MetaNova> step 5 needs to be done for every client
[05:10:31] <MetaNova> for each user
[05:10:55] <germ> I think he is missing the `autoadd' in clientbuffer
[05:11:24] <MetaNova> that's not required it's just recommended, [[Clientbuffer]] would discuss (along with /msg *clientbuffer help) how to add clients manually
[05:11:24] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Clientbuffer
[05:11:41] <MetaNova> otherwise step 5 - "Verify that each clientid is received/identified in *clientbuffer with /msg *clientbuffer listclients" should have covered this
[05:12:15] <germ> cheers I think this is where the thing would be!
[05:12:50] <MetaNova> you should be able to confirm if your user is actually supplying clientids with /msg *status listusers
[05:13:02] <germ> he uses hexchat
[05:13:04] <MetaNova> since that will also display what clientid any connected users are connected with
[05:13:43] <MetaNova> be sure he modified the correct setting in his client, the "User name" should change from user/network to user@client/network, [[Hexchat]]
[05:13:43] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Hexchat
[05:14:52] <germ> so right now I am debugging with a user that I cloned from his, I have full contorl
[05:15:05] <germ> s/contorl/control/
[05:15:05] <ZNC-Linker> germ meant: “so right now I am debugging with a user that I cloned from his, I have full control”
[05:16:38] <MetaNova> so that's why you were using --makepass
[05:16:40] <MetaNova> heh
[05:17:02] <MetaNova> it would have been much, much easier just to modify his account directly
[05:17:02] <germ> No! I had also locked myself out =)
[05:17:06] <MetaNova> oh
[05:17:12] <MetaNova> welp
[05:17:20] <germ> it was a sh*t show =)
[05:17:34] <MetaNova> it happens
[05:27:05] <germ> OK so I think I figured
[05:27:43] <germ> was the add client, at least for one of his access, I don't know if I as an admin can list *his* clients
[05:28:08] <MetaNova> listclients will list all connected clients
[05:28:15] <MetaNova> not just to your account, to the ZNC
[05:28:21] <germ> yeah but for me :)
[05:28:26] <germ> or his new fake user
[05:28:27] <MetaNova> not just to your account, to the ZNC
[05:28:34] <germ> listclients
[05:28:57] <MetaNova> when he connects even you should be able to verify if he is supplying a clientid
[05:29:13] <MetaNova> he can verify they've been added with '/msg *clientbuffer listclients'
[05:29:20] <MetaNova> anyway, sounds like you have it sorted
[05:30:00] <germ> ya more or less, I wich I would fix directly his thing, but I can have him punch in the command. Thank you so much ! Are you PST ?
[05:30:39] <MetaNova> EST
[05:30:57] <germ> wow cheers then
[05:31:10] <MetaNova> it's already past my normal bedtime (an hour ago), but I have tomorrow off so there's no need for me to rush to bed
[05:31:13] <germ> (I mean cheers no matter =) )
[05:31:20] <MetaNova> yeah no worries
[05:31:33] <germ> You in TO ?
[05:31:45] <MetaNova> nah
[05:31:49] <MetaNova> GA, US
[05:31:55] <germ> =b
[05:32:09] <germ> cuz you cool, I assumed ;p ;p
[05:32:22] <MetaNova> TO = Toronto?
[05:32:33] <MetaNova> since when are Canadians cool
[05:32:37] <MetaNova> ;-)
[05:32:54] <germ> Aha everyone's cool in TO, you don't have to be Canadian ! ;p
[05:33:01] <germ> ya for TO
[05:33:10] <MetaNova> well honestly Toronto sounds splendid, I hate this place
