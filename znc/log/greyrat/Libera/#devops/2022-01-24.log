[02:41:00] <rawtaz> i am
[02:41:21] <lantech19446> can't you ban 2 of em and see if he/she says anything?
[02:41:30] <rawtaz> i did earlier
[02:41:50] <lantech19446> o ok
[02:42:46] <rawtaz> but i would prefer that they actually respond when they are communicated with several times..
[02:43:12] <rawtaz> using "powers" is the last thing an op should do, IMO
[02:44:22] <lantech19446> I turned down the ophood i was offered because i know i'd ban the shit out of people who annoy me so you're probably right and i probably agree
[02:46:21] <rawtaz> good :D
[02:47:08] <rawtaz> yeah in general i think theres a lot of channels with mentally disturbed ops that think they are supposed to use their @ to kick and ban and silence and what not. instead of just using words and communication to take the fuel out of heated discussions.
[02:48:00] <rawtaz> most often its as simple as just showing some understanding to frustration, or telling people how they come across and that even if <whatever is wrong> is the case or their opinion, it doesnt help to write things they do, etc
[02:50:31] <lantech19446> considering this is for an entire channel of mentally ill people lol

[18:28:11] <lantech19446> shad: I need a webserver for k8s to work?
[18:28:56] <shad> you need a k8s cluster if you want to deploy containers there, yes
[18:30:15] <shad> the workflow is: you develop a cool website/api/whatever and want people to access it via Internet. You containerize your application using a Dockerfile, build and publish your container somewhere, then have the k8s cluster run it for you
[18:31:36] <lantech19446> ok so if i were containerizing something like pihole i wouldn't need a webserver for k8s
[18:32:02] <lantech19446> i know shit about shit when it comes to docker and kubernetes so i'm sure these are really basic questions
[18:32:52] <shad> well... i'm not sure you get the whole thing yet ;)
[18:33:21] <shad> Containers are a way to package your apps so that they run exactly the same, regardless of the hardware you run your containers on
[18:34:13] <lantech19446> right but you can containerize pihole because there's existing pihole containers you can download
[18:34:26] <shad> When you work profesionnaly with Docker, you start running a lot of containers. Like, a lot. Because it was a pain in the ass to maintain every container, smart people at google built what's called a container orchestrator, that manages all your containers for you
[18:35:50] <shad> pihole is something else, iirc it's a DNS server with embedded rules to black list known for ads domain names. Sure, people were able to put all the DNS configs & runtime applications in a container, and you could run it in a Kubernetes cluster, sure
[18:36:07] <shad> but that'd be quite the most overkill solution :D
[18:38:05] <lantech19446> ok let me ask it more directly then, is the webserver a function of kubernetes or a function of the fact that you're serving up a web based app in your container?
[18:39:45] *** Joins: gh34 (~textual@cpe-184-58-181-106.wi.res.rr.com)
[18:51:36] <nakedeyes> shad: nice and practical summary with your use case. maybe the ingress controller would deserve a few words, some reasoning just why we are installing ingress-nginx
[18:52:28] <shad> lantech19446: webserver is way too generic in that context. Your container if it has to speak on the network exposes a port. That port is then mapped to a service, service to an ingress, ingress to Internet
[18:53:46] <nakedeyes> lantech19946: a webserver is a running process using network resources, if that is containerized could be run within a cluster. the cluster itself provides some features through web-services, but itself it is not necessarily a webserver.
[18:53:55] <shad> nakedeyes: thanks. You're right, I don't explain what nginx-ingress does, i'll add a bit more description there
[18:57:06] <lantech19446> it's the fact that nginx is being run that made me think you were running a webserver and I didn't know if k8s needs that to function or if it was because you're containering a webapp
[18:58:21] <shad> that was the point nakedeyes was making, i didn't explain that enough. The idea is that a k8s cluster is usually made of many servers joined together in the cluster. You don't know (and don't care) where your container is being ran while it's in the cluster
[18:59:00] <shad> for that, you use a Load Balancer, named nginx-ingress, that is, a machine that receives the requests before your cluster and directs them to the right node->container
[18:59:54] <nakedeyes> shad: one another small note, you mention 4 objects at the beginning, the last of them is pods, then we dont interact with pods (at least not directly)
[19:00:27] <shad> So as an user, you want to access `api.mtvs.io`, the DNS record points to the LB, the LB transmits the request to the cluster service, that transmits it to the right container
[19:01:41] <lantech19446> ok that makes more sense, thank you
[19:02:52] <shad> nakedeyes: true, although i mention: "Deployment are where you define your Pods and their configuration.". I wanted to mention Pods as a resource because you hear it often when learning k8s, but now that I read it again i should make that more clear
[19:05:33] <shad> I realized i haven't defined Cluster either though, that'll be on the list too for rev2 :D
[19:06:01] <nakedeyes> shad: have you considered a link to docs for each API object? hmm..  that might also be overwhelming 
[19:08:03] <shad> I'd have to see how the CSS responds to things like "`[Deployment](https://...)`" 
[19:08:29] <shad> the article is written in .mdx files that adapt the markdown to react. Pretty neat stuff
[19:08:46] <shad> Didn't write it myself, but i'm rather happy to write the articles in markdown
[19:18:01] <nakedeyes> nice, i will check that one out
[19:23:49] <lantech19446> that is pretty cool shad I didn't even know such a beast existed
[19:29:02] <shad> lantech19446: you mean kubernetes or .mdx format ? :D
[19:29:14] <lantech19446> mdx
[19:30:02] <shad> both are great stuff. For the .mdx part, it's because i write almost exclusively documentation of my work in Markdown. Having a solution to write the blog in Markdown was a relief
[19:30:49] <shad> I don't use much of the features that allow to import jsx tags inside the markdown, but it makes a clean front end without much issues for me. I still struggle to align a <div
[19:34:43] <lantech19446> shad: I agree totally all of my network documentation is done in obsidian with the exception of passwords which are on an encrypted manager
[19:52:25] <shad> didn't knew about obsidian, it looks nice
[19:54:17] <lantech19446> it's pretty good, someone in this channel told me about it I forget who
[19:54:23] <slaughter> Probably me
[19:54:27] <slaughter> I'm a nut for Obsidian
[19:54:42] <lantech19446> probably cuz i've talked to you and rawtaz more than anyone else lol
[19:54:56] <slaughter> Well, I'm a nut for markdown and Obsidian is the winner for handling that IMO
[19:55:52] <lantech19446> I really like it I'm using it to keep track of all the things I want to learn for devops and I'm using it at work for all my network documentation and backing it up to github
[19:56:55] <lantech19446> fuck i just realized that's one of the things i lost when this laptop shit the bed
[19:59:36] <slaughter> Oh man always have a backup of your notes
[19:59:46] <slaughter> I'd rather lose literally everything else on this machine than my notes
[20:00:01] <slaughter> There's like 5 years of bullshit in here with a few gems I'd reallly miss
[20:00:07] <lantech19446> i think i backed it up to my github
[20:01:02] <slaughter> System and architecture designs for almost everything I've built, weird meeting notes, shell snippets and one liners, whole chunks of documentation I've summarized (how do I run this in Docker with that flag? Oh yeah I've got that right here). It takes work but it's worth it
[20:03:32] <lantech19446> I really suck at documenting things and I honestly never think to write most of it down
[20:07:50] <slaughter> That's part of the reason I got into taking so many notes, actually. Always trying to level up my documentation game
[20:08:04] <lantech19446> I should
[20:08:16] <slaughter> And when you get in the habit of taking little notes here or there - even if it's not "writing docs" - you tend to have the basis for your docs jotted down already so it's way quicker and easier to get going/review
[20:09:01] <slaughter> And nevermind the idea of a daily note with a "what did I do today" section - man that's huge for me, being able to look back and see what I did over a week. Lots of expletives, usually about TypeScript. It's great.
[20:09:19] <lantech19446> lol
[20:09:44] <slaughter> Today's the day I sign my offer! I'm hovering on the button now, not sure if I should do my round of rejections before I do it in case someone wants to hand me a new car to get me in the door or something
