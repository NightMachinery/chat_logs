[01:20:04] <artao> it's unprocessed
[01:20:20] <artao> a bit more of a "caramelly" flavor tho
[01:21:20] <artao> apparently tho it's not so great for baking cuz of ... how it is
[01:21:40] <artao> roughly granulated and takes effort to dissolve. like .. a lot of stirring in my coffee
[01:21:55] <artao> it's better for, say .. spriking on top of cookies than using in them

[01:28:04] <MusicalDillo> thought it involved digging

[07:34:17] <sdragon> I like my Zoom r24
[07:34:39] <sdragon> That makes for a good mixer
[07:35:23] <piercedwater> do you all _need_ anything more than a mic and software to record? I'm obviously totally oblivious to this hobby....just trying to get a feel for it atm
[07:36:37] <sdragon> Some sort of audio interface, so you have a way to connect the mic to the computer
[07:36:47] <piercedwater> makes sense
[07:37:58] <sdragon> But strictly speaking, there's nothing preventing you from making music without vocals, if you don't have a mic and/or interface
[07:38:01] <piercedwater> i'd like to play around with a keyboard or something, idk. maybe a congo drum? sitar would be cool, but those were $400 or something from what I saw on eBay
[07:38:39] <piercedwater> ah yeah, guess the internal mic would work in a pinch
[07:39:26] <piercedwater> maybe an old cell phone as a mic?
[07:39:28] <sdragon> You can get away with making music with nothing but software instruments
[07:39:48] <piercedwater> cool
[07:41:12] <sdragon> But yeah, if you're going to be recording anything, mic and interface
[07:41:34] <morlog> one of those external sound cards
[07:41:52] <piercedwater> Behringer or w/e the brand is called i guess
[07:42:12] <morlog> creative labs
[07:42:17] <sdragon> morlog: that'd be the interface, yeah
[07:42:23] <piercedwater> i'll do some research so i don't look like such an idiot
[07:42:36] <piercedwater> lol
[07:42:49] <sdragon> You might also want a MIDI controller
[07:43:07] <sdragon> But you don't have to get everything all at once
[07:43:08] <morlog> I could do with just a digital audio recorder that has 2 or more mic inputs
[07:43:28] <morlog> those still cost a pretty penny
[07:44:31] <morlog> right now though, I'm focused on getting gear together for my bike trip
[07:44:59] <morlog> will start thinking about recording equipment once I get to a summer spot
[07:45:33] <morlog> gonna play my drum to the cows while I travel
[07:45:40] <morlog> moo

[07:46:17] <morlog> ha
[07:46:39] <morlog> there is a herd of camels on the route I'm taking
[07:46:41] <piercedwater> $500....ugh
[07:46:44] <sdragon> I'd spend ~$100-120 each on a mic, interface, and MIDI controller

[07:47:18] <morlog> bike
[07:47:22] <piercedwater> oh hmm...$100 for a mic???
[07:47:41] <piercedwater> damn, i'm sounding cheap but that sounds like a ton to me for a mic
[07:47:52] <piercedwater> more research is in order
