[15:55:56] <FromGitter> <rappie> i would like to be able to open spacemacs from the commandline and have it open the current directory i'm in as a project. any suggestions on how i can do this? maybe some command line option that automatically makes a new layer? (i used to do `code .` with VS Code a lot on new small projects, and i'm looking for something similar with spacemacs)
[16:32:56] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Besides other options, you can add the file to your `spacemacs-banner-directory`, use the filepath directly as the value for `dotspacemacs-startup-banner` in your dotfile, or set the `spacemacs-banner-directory` value to the directory with your asci txt files...
[16:38:13] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I am not sure what it means to open a project... I guess you might mean open some 'layout'...
[16:39:27] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> To open a project, just open one of its files and you 'are' within the project
[16:39:33] <FromGitter> <rappie> yea from what i understand emacs looks kinda differently at projects :)
[16:40:38] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Well, you should define what makes up a project first.
[16:41:15] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Often it means that some file should be part of some directory...
[16:42:21] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I don't really work with projects (I am no programmer), but indeed I think lsp and projectile define projects differently (which might be confusing)
[16:43:12] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> You can even open the directory and you will be 'inside' the project, but you will see a 'dired' buffer...
[16:43:24] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I guess you mean how to startup a certain layout...
[16:43:31] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Unfortunately I never use layouts
[16:43:50] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> So I am not sure if I can quickly find an answer

[17:20:13] <FromGitter> <rappie> yea it's hard to say what i exactly want because emacs is so different :)
[17:20:27] <FromGitter> <rappie> i probably want something that i currently dont know exists yet
[17:22:54] <FromGitter> <rappie> so a `dired` buffer would be fine as a start
[17:23:39] <FromGitter> <rappie> the thing right now is that if i do this (using `emas .`), it switches to the last layout used because i have `dotspacemacs-auto-resume-layouts t` set
[17:24:13] <FromGitter> <rappie> the reason i have this set is because i dont want spacemacs to start with just the splash screen, i prefer it to start with 2 windows open side by side
[17:24:31] <FromGitter> <rappie> i guess i mostly use it right now because i do `SPC q r` a lot to test things
[17:24:37] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I guess using the emacsclient will sovle this
[17:25:06] <FromGitter> <rappie> maybe i should just try to turn it off and start using the recent projects thing on the splash screen
[17:25:16] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Set `dotspacemacs-enable-server` to t in you dotfile
[17:25:56] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> and use the command `emacsclient` in you terminal instead of emacs
[17:26:12] <FromGitter> <rappie> ahh hmm
[17:26:30] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Generally, Emacs, in normal use, should not be restarted
[17:27:14] <FromGitter> <rappie> is it possible to do a full reload of everything without restarting?
[17:28:23] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Ah, I am using my Emacs gitter client, and quoting a message

However if I have an unrecognized object in the current file, ie already typed out, there is no associated code action (or at least I cannot find it) for importing that undefined name.  Is there a way to access the same auto-import functionality presented when typing

[21:25:52] <FromGitter> <dam5h> you could pip a CLI `rg` command to a file I suppose.  But I'm guessing you want the interactive nature of jumping around your results in the other buffers.

[21:26:18] <FromGitter> <drpastah:matrix.org> I just assumed there's a more streamlined way to keep track of various searching
[21:26:52] <FromGitter> <drpastah:matrix.org> yeah, interactive is best. i already don't know the controls in that buffer and only see that pressing enter changes the window to that buffer instead of opening a new window
