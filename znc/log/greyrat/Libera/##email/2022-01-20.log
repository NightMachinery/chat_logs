[02:15:41] <bookworm> RFC 5321
[02:15:52] <bookworm> just saying
[02:18:15] <bookworm> >In RFC 821, the two hosts participating in an SMTP transaction were described as the "SMTP-sender" and "SMTP-receiver".  This document has been changed to reflect current industry terminology and hence refers to them as the "SMTP client" (or sometimes just "the client") and "SMTP server" (or just "the server"), respectively.  Since a given host
[02:18:15] <bookworm> may act both as server and client in a relay situation, "receiver" and "sender" terminology is still used where needed for clarity.

[06:51:45] <pj> It's always a client that talks to the server.  The client on a port 25 connection is only a server in the sense that it also generally listens on a port for connections and receives mail on them.  
[06:52:50] *** Joins: kristijonas (~kristijon@78-56-32-39.static.zebra.lt)
[06:52:59] <pj> with postfix it is a rather important distinction because smtp client connections use different settings (smtp_*) to smtp server connections (smtpd_*).
[06:53:18] <pj> I can't speak for other MTAs in that regard.
[06:54:11] <pj> and yeah, that pretty much agrees with RFC 5321 as you've noted.

[16:58:44] <jm18> exchange online is rewriting URLs with 'safe links' causing DKIM to fail. does anyone know if there is a solution to this without disabling safe links?

[16:59:26] <Khepra> jm18: what are "safe links"?
[16:59:52] <lunaphyte> jm18: it's not clear to me how that would make dkim fail
[17:05:11] *** Quits: Guest9014 (~vit@chello085216193138.chello.sk) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[17:05:55] <jm18> safe links rewites the url to resirect via safelinks.protect.outlook.com which scans the destination for threats.
[17:06:11] <jm18> it fails dkim because the url changes the body of the mail
[17:06:25] <jm18> url rewrite changes the body of the mail
[17:07:55] <bremner> well, they already break GPG encryption/signatures for years now, so I guess it's hopeless
[17:08:20] <bremner> maybe some big players care about DKIM and can lean on microsoft, dunno
[17:09:31] *** dob1_ is now known as dob1
[17:13:55] <jm18> this is relating to inbound mail from outside the organisation (thought i had mentioned that)
[17:15:42] <bremner> Oh, you are actually running exchange? Well, that's a different set of problems, but I guess there should be some "official" support channels.
[17:15:48] <bookworm> at that point you already validated dkim though... are you trying to revalidate it in the MUA?
[17:20:43] <jm18> that makes sense. the dkim has failed and i cannot see any other reason. perhaps i need to investigate more
[17:20:44] <lunaphyte> jm18: you're saying the microsoft is modifying the message body, and then performing its dkim check, which fails?
[17:21:12] <jm18> that is how it appears
[17:21:45] <lunaphyte> you'd have to ask them about that then
[17:22:49] <lunaphyte> that hasn't been my experience.  in my messages, i see "dkim=pass (signature was verified)"
[17:23:50] <jm18> perhaps there is some other reason then. i'll dig a little deeper. thanks guys
[18:00:01] <lunaphyte> where, specifically, and how, are you seeing dkim fail?

[18:49:25] <jimpop> how does one get to the place in life where you format an email address as:  "Unnoticed Symptom" <LeeH.Baucom,Ph.D.,@longevitor.biz>
[18:51:01] <lunaphyte> if that's an address that an admin actually created, that would be pretty impressive

[18:56:35] <jimpop> i haven't looked, but I'm almost certain it's someone promoting alternative medicine
