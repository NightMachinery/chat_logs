[04:41:57] <Kai96> Hi, been tinkering with the libraries and coming across issues using AVFoundation for screen capturing with FFMpeg on MacOS. Basically AVCaptureScreenInput is not linked to my C app (as AVCaptureScreenShot is coded in objc), though I have been partially expecting libavdevice/avfoundation.m to manage that relationship as it does for CLI. Frameworks
[04:41:57] <Kai96> have been linked in CMake files, etc. to no avail
[04:41:58] <Kai96> Currently reaching out before I just create an objc++ implementation using Apple's AVFoundation when MacOS/iOS is identified, and avoiding FFMpeg libs for that scenario.. Apple hates open source anyways..
[04:41:58] <Kai96> Didn't realize a new major release was coming today though.. happy release day! Going to update in the mean time and try some more

[04:50:19] <h-m-h> I just upgraded to 5.0. Unfortunately my static build on macOS is broken now. The culprit seems to be the introduction of `__builtin_available` which is not suitable for static builds. See https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/4314 for example.
[04:50:24] <Kai96> cmake-specific build config. Still a noob to the world of builds and C in general though, might be worth building from CLI for more experience

[04:52:11] <BtbN> h-m-h, that sounds like an issue with the toolchain, not ffmpeg?
[04:52:44] <BtbN> That __builtin_available thing is used all over the place in ffmpeg, so removing it is not exactly practical

[12:57:24] <dustsigns> Hi. Are there any plans to have API documentation for v 5.0 on the official documentation page (http://ffmpeg.org/documentation.html)? It would be nice to be able to point other developers to a specific version rather than trunk. For v 4.1 and prior, this was possible. It would be really nice to have this for a major version like 5.0. If I can help
[12:57:24] <dustsigns> with that, I would also be happy to.

[13:29:21] <dustsigns> I would also be happy if there was an easy way to build just the API documentation of a particular version of FFmpeg. As far as I have tried, I only found a way to build HTML/Doxygen documentation (via configure and make) for those component which are enabled or auto-detected through configure. I would, however, like to have the documentation for
[13:29:21] <dustsigns> all components, preferably in a way that I can easily share with other developers.

[20:35:17] <libredev> Hi
[20:35:37] <libredev> I want to do some advance stuff with ffmpeg

[20:52:38] <irc_user> libredev: `ffmpeg -i in.mp4 -filter:v "crop=out_w:out_h❌y" out.mp4`
[20:54:33] <libredev> irc_user: i want to keep move the viewport at specific position at different timestamps and crop that.
[20:56:14] <irc_user> libredev: It sounds like you should just use a video editor, that seems like it'd be a pain to do with ffmpeg alone.
[20:56:48] <crashrep> the crop filter can evaluate the values of "x" and "y" for every frame, but i don't know any easy way to have dynamic cropping, especially one that moves in many different directions
[20:57:07] <libredev> I don't like gui
[20:57:49] <irc_user> So you'd rather manually figure out what x and y values to use for each cut?
[20:58:20] <irc_user> There are many free video editors which would speed up that process by a lot.
[20:58:20] <libredev> crashrep: i provide the position and timestamp, i just want ffmpeg to linearly move the viewport.
[21:00:31] <libredev> irc_user: i can just move my mouse on playing video and calculate the position of my mouse, and transformer the coordinate in video scale.
[21:00:38] <libredev> Just easy
[21:01:24] <libredev> No editor required for this simple thing
[21:02:21] <libredev> I just want that linear effect in between frames.
[21:03:14] <irc_user> If you're doing this for fun/learning then I get it, but if what you want is the result then this is literally what a video editor is for, regardless of how simple. I'm not trying to discourage you though.
[21:04:09] <libredev> irc_user: why u think i am doing this for fun.
[21:04:18] <libredev> I am serious
[21:04:58] <libredev> I don't have big computer to run video editors
[21:05:27] <kepstin> eh, it's just gonna be a lot of work. as crashrep mentioned, the crop filter takes expressions for the x and y. You just have to write an expression that generates the correct x and y as a function of time.
[21:05:44] <kepstin> I say "just", but, well, that's the hard part :)
[21:06:14] <libredev> kepstin: x as a function of time !
[21:06:46] <libredev> Ok i have to think
[21:07:30] <irc_user> You don't need a big computer, especially if it's just a simple linear crop animation as you mentioned. It's not like I'm recommending you use adobe premier or something, plenty of FOSS tools will get the job done.
[21:11:25] <libredev> irc_user: i don't know why people always like the complicated way of doing things.
[21:13:02] <irc_user> Doing this with ffmpeg is what would be complicated.

[21:24:29] <libredev> This is simple linear equation
[21:24:30] <kepstin> libredev: start by reading the crop filter docs: https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#crop
[21:26:49] <libredev> Ok thanks
[21:27:31] <kepstin> note that if your video has subsampled chroma there's some complications, you  might have issues with values that aren't multiples of 2
[21:27:56] <kepstin> (for smoother panning, i'd recommend converting to non-subsampled chroma, e.g. yuv444p, then converting back afterwards)
[21:28:27] <kepstin> this use of the crop filter won't do any interpolation, like a more advanced app could.

[22:25:50] <aiena> not really an ffmpeg question. A bit offtopic. But does anyone know if I can use vlc with my custom built ffmpeg or I need to build it from source with it?
[22:26:20] <aiena> I noticed ubuntu ffmpeg pre built binaries compe missing some features
[22:26:26] <aiena> *come
[22:30:04] <MrPaul> I chated with someone yesterday regarding a mpeg-ts file that's got out of sync audio when run through ffmpeg but not playback.  In the end I learned that running like `ffmpeg -vsync passthrough -copyts -i index.ts` will result in me being able to encode as I see fit.
[22:30:04] <MrPaul> However, the resulting mp4 still has messed up timestamps because even though the audio is in sync the playback shows to be 28hr but only the first 2.5hr are actual video.
[22:30:22] <MrPaul> Is there something I can do to fix this?
[22:31:38] <kepstin> aiena: if you have a sufficiently matching ffmpeg (same so versions, same or newer ffmpeg version) and have built dynamic libs, then you can probably use it by setting up library paths to load your ffmpeg libs before the system ones when running vlc. Otherwise, rebuild vlc.
[22:31:46] *** Joins: lavaball (thomas@31.204.155.215)
[22:33:48] <aiena> ok but maybe I don't need a custom vlc/ffmpeg. I cannot find a vlc channel on libera but I noticed when I lopp a short 50 frame video I made in vlc on video start there is a flicker. THis does not seem to happen on mpv of with ffplay. I tried switching the output options on vlc but no luck
[22:34:13] <aiena> I noyl get an error in vlc about vdpau initialisation failure and then I saiw ffmpeg is not built with that
[22:34:17] <zeromind> it's #videolan
[22:34:32] <aiena> oh
[22:37:35] <aiena> I made, in VLC ...
[22:41:53] <zeromind> MrPaul: you mean the audio continues after the video ends? '-shortest' might help; "Finish encoding when the shortest input stream ends."

[22:43:57] <MrPaul> I'll try that.  At least then it won't show that it's a 28hour video.
[22:43:58] <MrPaul> But shouldn't the resulting mkv have proper timestamps?  Like none of "Non-monotonous DTS in output stream 0:0; previous: 9238534902, current: 8595979592; changing to 9238534903. This may result in incorrect timestamps in the output file".
[22:45:18] <MrPaul> I know it may be cosmetic but I'm looking for reasons my cutting tool (VideoReDo v6) and even lossless-cut seem to spaz out on it.
