[00:35:12] <Franciman> phi ^ ~phi
[00:35:14] <Franciman> everything follows?
[00:35:17] <Franciman> in propositional logic?
[00:35:19] <Franciman> it's

[00:35:26] <cuppajoeman> Oh yes, by the vacuous
[00:35:28] <Franciman> ex falso quodlibet
[00:35:33] <Franciman> phi^~phi is necessarily false

[05:04:09] <cuppajoeman> We're trying to show X x Y \ G is open so we shot that there is another open set inside of it

[05:11:19] <Z-module> Think visually of X = Y = R here, so X x Y  is the plane. Think of f:X -> Y  as a any continuous function, no matter how squiggy, so G = Gr(f) is its graph in the plane.  You want to show that R^2 \ G  is open, so you pick any point of that set, and find some tiny open rectangle around that set that is disjoint from G.

[05:17:11] <cuppajoeman> thank you
[05:18:04] <Z-module> cuppajoeman: so all they did, to get (X x Y)\G to be open, is reduce it to showing that every point of that set is inside some open rectangle that's entirely contained in that set.
[05:18:20] <Z-module> so (X x Y)\G is open so G is closed.
[05:20:09] <Z-module> My word "rectangle" isn't really mean literally. It's simply by analogy to the very basic case of a set  (a,b) x (c,d)  in R^2
[05:20:51] <Z-module> (which *is* an open rectangular region, geometrically)

And then saying this sequence of "points" vn (each of which is an infinite

[06:25:45] <PlanckWalk> No, not everything is iff there.
[06:26:09] <Fangs> cuppajoeman: the other direction should follow from the fact that continuous functions preserves limits
[06:26:30] <PlanckWalk> Having pi_i(L) as a limit in each projection doesn't imply that L is a limit in the box topology.

[08:40:07] <cuppajoeman> I know tha tin order for this to happen my function needs to have period pi
[08:40:26] <cuppajoeman> so I tried the general form b * sin(2t) + c * cos(2t)
[08:40:42] <cuppajoeman> That lead to (2c - 3b) cos(2t) + (-3c - 2b) sin(2t) = A sin(t)

[08:42:06] <qergle> what's the general way, forgetting about the period, to solve y"+y'+y=Asin(t)?
[08:43:01] <cuppajoeman> What about -A cos(t) ?
[08:44:30] <qergle> hrmm
[08:44:50] <qergle> subtracting Acos(t) from the homogeneous solution will work, is that what you mean?
[08:45:04] <cuppajoeman> that works becuase y = -Acos(t), y' = A sin(t) and y'' = A cos(t) ?
[08:45:31] <frelleck> no solution will have period pi
[08:45:48] <frelleck> the only solution that is periodic is -Acos(t) itself
[08:46:25] <frelleck> the homogeneous soluton has decaying exponentials times a trig function with the wrong period

[09:27:40] <gganbu> right, commutativity holds, but it is not a group, and associativity holds! (a * b) * c = a * (b * c), but Z/10Z doesn't have inverses

[09:28:29] <qergle> why is what?
[09:28:42] <gganbu> 2,4,5,6,8 share factors with 10 so its related to them not having inverses

[09:29:26] <gganbu> aha, that's right!

[09:29:57] <qergle> {1,3,7,9} with multiplication mod 10 is a group.

[14:14:37] <PlanckWalk> Their expression is just a=mp^n, k=p^n
[14:15:53] <PlanckWalk> They're just writing in notation "every factor of p^l in the numerator is cancelled by exactly the same factor in the same term in the denominator"

[17:10:09] <cads> in fact it seems we can extend the proof to countably infinite random graphs with other connectivity rates, say G(p) with p in (0, 1)

[18:40:13] <Z-module> Very generally (and it's weird to me how few books ever bring this up), if G is any group and X is any set of cardinality |G|, if you fix some set bijection  phi: G -> X   then you can "transfer" G's group operation to X and make X a group isomorphic to G, by taking any x, y in X, pulling those back to G using phi^-1, multiplying those things in G, and than pushing that product back to X using phi.  Your thing has done exactly this
[18:40:13] <Z-module> where G = (R^*, *)  (multiplicative group of nonzero reals), X = R\{-1},  phi being the "subtract 1" bijection.
[18:40:25] <Z-module> I've done this exact exercise before, it wasn't magic.
[18:40:45] <Z-module> but the transfer-group-using-bijection thing really comes up a lot and is very useful.

[21:21:24] <fweht> ok
[21:21:38] <isekaijin> Then these cosines are precisely the real parts of the vertices.
[21:21:54] <fweht> yes indeed

[21:22:54] <fweht> ah ok :)
[21:23:04] <fweht> that makes sense
[21:23:05] <isekaijin> Each such pair corresponds to a term in the sum from n = 1 to N-2.

[22:59:27] <Guest27> if I have f_1 =0, f_2 = 0, ..., f_n =0, where f_i are polynomials...is it equivaluate to solve that system by solving g_1 * f_1 + ... + g_n * f_n = 0 where g_i are polynomials?
[22:59:41] <isekaijin> fweht: As far as I can tell, what you are doing is essentially interpolating a “sum of cosines” signal that passes through the values x_n at evenly spaced times. Furthermore, x_0 is the value at the beginning of each period (or the end of the previous one) and x_N is the value exactly at the middle of the period.
[23:00:01] <Z-module> Guest27, over what field?
[23:00:03] *** Joins: horseface (~horseface@user/horseface)
[23:00:11] <Guest27> any field? I am wanting to understand this: https://i.imgur.com/0ZzIHwd.png
[23:00:14] <riv> it doesn't look equivalent
[23:00:17] <isekaijin> Guest27: In general, no.

[23:00:44] <riv> I think what's being said is that  f_1 =0, f_2 = 0, ..., f_n =0  implies  g_1 * f_1 + ... + g_n * f_n = 0
[23:00:49] <riv> not that they are equivalent
[23:00:51] <qergle> that's going in one direction only
[23:00:58] <isekaijin> In general, f_1 = ... = f_n = 0 defines a subvariety of affine space of codimension n, whereas g1 f1 + ... + gn fn = 0 defines a hypersurface, i.e., a subvariety of codimension 1.
[23:01:00] <Guest27> Sorry here is a better picture https://i.imgur.com/X3LZNeV.png
[23:01:01] <qergle> not both directions (as in your question)
[23:01:24] <Guest27> oh okay riv, qergle
[23:01:25] <isekaijin> There are exceptional cases, but they are, well, exceptional.

[23:58:35] <Guest27> can someone tell me some real-world applications of algebraic geometry? If its just about solving systems of polynomials...how is that ever relevant to real life problems as I figure anything interested is described by ODEs / PDEs
[23:59:08] <Macuser> hm this is interesting. My plot of minimum angular separation of starlink satellites seems to appear quantized. I used the Law of Cosines and solved for a spherical triangle
[23:59:14] <Macuser> any guesses what's happening here?
