[02:26:40] <bpalmer> github markdown is based on commonmark, although I don't know if it's identical
[02:26:58] <kensanata> My markdown mode has a preview command.
[02:27:01] <bpalmer> I see there's also a project "goldmark", which is a go-based and fuzzed tool -- its home page has some interesting commentary.
[02:27:04] <kensanata> It renders in eww.
[02:27:07] <bpalmer> I don't actually use it, though.
[02:27:50] <kensanata> commonmark is different from github markdown in small and subtle ways. It's a good authoring markup but a bad information interchange format, I guess. :)

[02:32:15] <kensanata> That's why I'm only now discovering these preview commands…

[03:56:06] <twb> mode-line-format is a big data structure
[03:56:20] <twb> you probably just want to edit that, or (more likely) prevent whatever is editing it
[03:56:35] <blacked> right but i want to remove something rather than editing all of theme.

[15:09:55] <blacked> wasamasa it takes time, may be i would be dead but times doesnt comes
[15:10:08] <s-liao> wasamasa do you have a time to look at the above question I wrote out here. Thanks in advance.
[15:11:26] <wasamasa> so far the answer seems to be that zoning applies to the visible part of a buffer
[15:11:32] <wasamasa> this part is specific to a window
[15:11:49] <wasamasa> you could probably hack `zone' to walk across all windows

[23:37:02] <ngz> Note your expectations are different from Markdown, too, since bold is **bold** is markdown.
[23:37:06] <ngz> in*
[23:37:10] <grym> ... sometimes
[23:38:05] <bpalmer> you could also try things like rst-mode, etc
[23:38:07] <ngz> Also, you cannot change the markers in Org syntax, but you have full control on how they are fontified and exported.
[23:38:48] <bpalmer> Why are you trying to avoid markdown, though?
[23:38:51] <Catie> Well, and ain't _this_ italics in Markdown as well?
[23:39:09] <rpav> markdown-mode specifically defines a lot of things i don't care about, i just want a few simple formatting things
[23:39:12] <rpav> Catie: it is
[23:39:29] <grym> or /this/
[23:39:52] <bpalmer> I would think it's easier to just ignore things you don't care about.
[23:39:55] <Catie> Too many Marks down
[23:40:12] <bpalmer> But you could also write your own quick minor mode that uses font-lock to decorate the simple patterns you want

[23:43:04] <rpav> cool .. will look into it a bit later
[23:43:25] <rpav> a slight bit of formatting would go nicely with visual-line-mode and adaptive-wrap-prefix-mode
[23:43:45] <rpav> markdown-mode specifically messes with the latter which is annoying .. does a number of annoying things really ;/
[23:43:48] <bpalmer> so you just want your own lightweight text format?
[23:44:02] <rpav> yeah just to show a few things on top of plain text
[23:44:24] <bpalmer> yeah, this is the path to yet another standard.
[23:44:36] <rpav> i saw there is like enriched-mode or something too but i also don't really want to press keys like it's 80s wordperfect ;)
[23:45:32] <bpalmer> I'd look to see if there's a markdown mode you prefer, or if rST and rst-mode is your bandwagon, or if it's worth adapting to org or muse or emacs-wiki-mode, or ...
[23:46:24] <bremner> rst-mode is not wonderful
[23:46:27] <Sario> xkcd 927 should probably be in the /topic of all software channels
[23:46:42] <Sario> https://xkcd.com/927/
[23:47:01] <Sario> I keep forgetting that fsbot is currently dead
[23:47:08] <bremner> rst is IMHO more suitable for non-trivial documents than markdown
[23:47:13] <rpav> 927 only really applies to trying to make a unifying standard
[23:47:32] <rpav> i only care about a thing for my notes
[23:47:42] <bremner> I'd use org for that.
[23:47:52] <rpav> org is the worst of all
[23:48:10] <bremner> yep, but org-mode, for all it's warts, is way better than markdown-mode or rst-mode
[23:48:18] <bremner> damnit. its warts

[23:49:49] <xaltsc> Hey, if I understand correctly, require first tries to load the file matching the feature, then uses the argument if present. So, can there be two files with the same name (under different directories, but within the load path), providing different features ?

[23:53:54] <bpalmer> xaltsc: as I recall, if you are using require's built in heuristic to map 'foo to "foo.el", it will stop at the first one of those that it finds, either with a success if the feature is then provided, or with an error if it is not.
[23:54:26] <bpalmer> xaltsc: it's certainly possible to have it work if you explicitly provide the path to load if the feature is not provided, using the FILENAME parameter
