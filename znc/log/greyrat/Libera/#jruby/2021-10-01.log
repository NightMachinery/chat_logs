[03:56:46] <shibz[m]> Hello! Congrats on the 9.3 launch!  Is there anywhere I can go to read-up on how JRuby does maintenance releases for past major versions?  Mostly just wanting to know whether (and for how long) security fixes might be released for 9.2.
[04:37:04] <headius> shibz hello there! We should have that somewhere on the wiki but the plan will be to maintain 9.2 for at least 6mo
[04:37:13] <headius> It kinda depends how well migration to 9.3 goes
[04:55:56] <shibz[m]> Awesome, thank you! :)

[12:57:19] <mlaug> Hi! Anyone noticed problems with Jruby and the recent DST Root CA X3 expiration? I can't establish connections to servers which use LetsEncrypt certs and present the full chain (including the R3 intermediate and ISRG Root X1). If I use native Ruby or Java, everything works fine.
[13:16:43] <mlaug> I've put the problem into a Github Issue: https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6872
