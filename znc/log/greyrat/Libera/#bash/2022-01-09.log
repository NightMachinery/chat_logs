[01:46:07] <MrCollinsGA> hello. can a bash script be run inside another bash script? so if a script I executed was foo.sh and in that script I had bar.sh (it also is chmod +x already) would it then execute?     example --> ./foo/bar/bar.sh
[01:46:56] <MrCollinsGA> does it have to have sh ./foo/bar/bar.sh or can it be ./foo/bar/bar.sh
[01:48:27] <Blondie101010> easy enough to test
[01:48:30] <tirnanog> as long as it's marked executable and has a valid shebang, you can execute it just as you would any other executable. do not use "sh", not least because that would pre-supposed the interpreter when it's the shebang that should decide.

[01:49:33] <tirnanog> !shebang
[01:49:33] <greybot> The top of a script MUST have a #! line, called 'shebang' or 'hashbang'. It tells the kernel what program to run your script with. We recommend `#!/usr/bin/env bash` (why: http://stackoverflow.com/a/733901/58803). http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/CommandsAndArguments#Scripts http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/shebang/

[01:51:41] <Blondie101010> emanuele6  that's false
[01:51:43] <emanuele6> Blondie101010: you can run `./a.sh' inside of bash even if it does not have a shebang, because bash will assume the file is a bash script if it does not have a shebang or is not an elf

[01:51:49] <emanuele6> but that is just bash.

[01:52:19] <emanuele6> yes.
[01:52:20] <tirnanog> MrCollinsGA: the key thing to understand is that the decision as to how to execute a file (implying +x) is made by your OS kernel.
[01:52:21] <MrCollinsGA> im sorry I didnt mean to start a bashing
[01:52:25] <Blondie101010> it's not REQUIRED
[01:52:30] <emanuele6> you can't run the script outside of bash if you don't put it.
[01:52:43] <MrCollinsGA> tirnanog, thank you kindly! :)
[01:52:59] <tirnanog> MrCollinsGA: so, for executable scripts, the shebang is required. that's how the kernel identifies which interpreter to execute, which is then tasked with reading the file in question.

[03:42:58] <tirnanog> the likely answer is, quite simply, that the standard doesn't state that mv must behave in the fashion that you expect.
[03:43:19] *** Quits: cuppajoe (~joe@ip70-171-93-122.no.no.cox.net) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[03:43:22] <tirnanog> it's somewhat wishy-washy on this point: "the mv utility shall write a prompt to standard error and read a line from standard input. If the response is not affirmative, mv shall do nothing more with the current source_file and go on to any remaining source_files."
[03:43:54] <phy1729> 0 All input files were moved successfully. >0 An error occurred.
[03:44:42] <tirnanog> that seems vague enough as to be open to interpretation.
[03:44:53] <tirnanog> (not the exit status behaviour, but the above).
[03:45:50] <phy1729> This is why you have to get a POSIX lawyer :p
[03:46:03] <tirnanog> that being said, the behaviour of gnu mv, at least, seems reasonable to me.
[03:46:28] <tirnanog> # touch a b; : | mv -i a b; echo $?
[03:46:30] <shbot> tirnanog: mv: overwrite 'b'? 0
[03:46:36] <tirnanog> ok, I guess that might be considered weird.
[03:46:52] <tirnanog> # touch a b; exec 0>&-; mv -i a b; echo $?
[03:46:53] <shbot> tirnanog: mv: overwrite 'b'? mv: error closing file: Bad file descriptor
[03:46:53] <shbot> tirnanog: 1
[03:46:56] <tirnanog> that's good, at least.
[03:51:03] <voldial> interesting, I think(?) solves my problem generally... testing

[03:57:03] <voldial> which exits 0
[03:57:23] <tirnanog> ok, but the stated outcome doesn't match the claim that fd 0 was closed. that's what I mean.

[03:58:07] <voldial> Blondie101010: no

[03:58:36] <tirnanog> so I'm asking: are you sure that's what's happening?
[03:59:03] <voldial> tirnanog: yes, this is confusing, you had to "touch a b; exec 0>&-; mv -i a b; echo $?" to get mv to exit 1

[04:04:56] <tirnanog> look at this way. if you provided a non-affirmative response for all of the files in question, would you expect it to exit 1 at the end? probably not.
[04:05:09] <tirnanog> say, you entered 'n' throughout.
[04:05:23] <voldial> yea, hm.

[04:06:24] <voldial> I agree, but eh... I'm trying to write corner case free code (I know, not possible) so stuff like this I tend to wrap up in a class so it cant happen again (my mususe).

[04:10:49] <tirnanog> you should probably check for yourself with sys.stdin.isatty() - or however it's done in python these days.
[04:10:56] <tirnanog> you can handle that however you want.
[04:11:05] <voldial> regarding https://bpa.st/SY5Q ignore _bg= it does not matter for this example
[04:11:28] <earendel> how again do i get the pid of the last process started? $..
[04:11:30] *** Joins: Filohuhum (~dante@gateway/tor-sasl/filohuhum)
[04:11:46] <tirnanog> !$!
[04:11:46] <greybot> $! expands to the process ID of the most recently executed background (asynchronous) command. In bash 4.4 and later this includes process substitutions.
[04:11:58] <voldial> tirnanog: yes, I'm very familiar with it, so the sh module decided if it's going to hand a tty over or not, by default, it does
[04:12:23] <tirnanog> how do you know? is there documentation to this effect?
[04:12:41] <voldial> tirnanog: yes, one sec. the code is pretty nice to read too.
[04:13:25] <earendel> tirnanog: having sth like: p1 | p2;  how would you get the PID of p1 (please just put it into this template:)
[04:13:29] <voldial> tirnanog: https://amoffat.github.io/sh/sections/special_arguments.html?highlight=tty#ttys
[04:13:46] <earendel> p1 | { pid=$!; p2 } ?
[04:14:09] <voldial> tirnanog: I was mistaken, _tty_in=False is the default
[04:14:32] <tirnanog> so it probably just leaves the file descriptor alone in that case.
[04:15:25] <earendel> okay. i just want the pid of the process. but i use a pipe. that's actually all to stop me now in bash. :/
[04:15:25] <voldial> yea, which matches the "touch a b; : | mv -i a b; echo $?" behaviour

[04:16:13] *** Quits: goldfish (~goldfish@user/goldfish) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[04:16:31] <tirnanog> earendel: the problem is that p1 | p2 isn't an async command to begin with. you'd need to use & or a procsub or whatever. maybe p2 < <(p1).
[04:19:19] <tirnanog> although, that might not behave as you expect, come to think of it. I think $! woudl then give you the pid of the subshell rather than of p1 itself.
[04:19:37] <earendel> tirnanog: ui. is that how you would go about storing the PID of processes you "own"? somebody recently made the call i should know it. sounds actually easy done. with that $! thing. and then .. nada.
[04:20:34] <tirnanog> generally, you background it. like, p1 & pid=$!, subsquently waiting if you need to.
[04:20:39] <earendel> it has not to be this way at all. maybe there are some known practices or so.. what about that pidfile thingy way
[04:20:57] <earendel> like sleep a mom.. right?

[04:21:43] <tirnanog> I'm not really sure of the context of your problem, so it's hard to recommend a specific approach.
[04:21:46] <earendel> or subshell.. however i need to wait. and can't sleep.
[04:21:59] <earendel> since sleep has a process?
[04:22:02] <earendel> or doesnt't it.

[23:00:51] <greybot> ex is a POSIX command-based file editor: ex -sc '%s/long john/big ed/g|x' file. If your ex is vim it can also take multiple files using ge and argdo: ex -sc 'argdo %s/foo/bar/ge|x' *.txt # See http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/ex.html

[23:01:22] <MrCollinsGA> well I want to do it in a script. does that matter
[23:01:29] <emanuele6> especially if you are only using s///, it is literally the same syntax with |x at the end
[23:01:58] <emanuele6> MrCollinsGA: yes, `sed -i' destroys a lot of metadata about the file
[23:02:27] <emanuele6> changes the modification time, the inode, everything
[23:02:29] <MrCollinsGA> yeah all I want to do is change a few parts of an xml file and I am learning sed xmlstarlet

[23:03:49] <emanuele6> MrCollinsGA: it creates a new file, and outputs the output of the sed command there, then it `mv's the new file to the old file, then it tries to `chmod' it to the old permissions and `chown' it to the old owner if it has permissions to do so.

[23:07:07] <emanuele6> n.b. if you use wq! instead of x!, you will always change the modification time ( but that is still way better then `sed -i' )
[23:07:46] <emanuele6> plus `sed -i' (other then being terrible for editing files) is very hard to use cross platform and is not even defined by POSIX
[23:07:59] <emanuele6> while `ex' is a standard POSIX tool

[23:09:22] <emanuele6> % is not valid sed
[23:09:39] <emanuele6> and you need to terminate the sed command
[23:10:11] <emanuele6> either with \; or +, it this case + is better

[23:15:21] <MrCollinsGA> xml script
[23:15:30] <emanuele6> what is the find command doing?
[23:16:02] <MrCollinsGA> I guess I was trying to tell sed in which file to look
[23:16:14] <emanuele6> which files do you want to run sed on?
[23:16:16] <MrCollinsGA> but now I want to tell 'ex' where to look because I know where the file is
[23:16:29] <emanuele6> is it just one file?
[23:16:32] <MrCollinsGA> xml but you just told me not to use sed
[23:16:34] <MrCollinsGA> yes
[23:16:41] <emanuele6> then why would you need find?
[23:16:41] <MrCollinsGA> one file and thats it
[23:17:11] <MrCollinsGA> because i dont know what im doing and i dont know how to 'tell' the kernel or whatever which file I want to perform said commands to
[23:17:28] <emanuele6> find searches files in a directory (and its subdirectories) that match a filter.
[23:17:52] <MrCollinsGA> ok. how do i tell ex which file to look for my string
[23:18:10] <emanuele6> e.g.   find . -type f -name 'a*'   will find all files in the current directory of which the filename starts with "a"
[23:18:31] <emanuele6> if you know one file, just pass it
[23:18:42] <emanuele6>  sed -i 'whatever' file

[23:19:59] <MrCollinsGA> I am not confused any longer, at least on that :)
