[01:45:26] <rdbeni0> hi all, in emacs notmuch-pull is the same as "notmuch new" in cli ?
[01:45:35] <rdbeni0> poll*
[01:46:01] <rdbeni0> i am looking for variable which allow me run "notmuch new" or similar CLI script

[01:49:05] <rdbeni0> it will be that
[01:49:20] <rdbeni0> M-x notmuch-poll , and i can configure notmuch-poll-script variable

[02:01:13] <Domo> sure
[02:01:21] <Domo> it expects that all being the command
[02:01:23] <rdbeni0> what is wrong?
[02:01:30] <Domo> it is not run by shell
[02:02:10] <rdbeni0> for example i would like call like you, with --verbose
[02:02:28] <rdbeni0> so what (setq notmuch-poll-script "") should be in that case?

[02:06:22] <rdbeni0> ok. can i use /usr/sbin/notmuch ?
[02:06:27] <rdbeni0> i like it
[02:06:56] <rdbeni0> btw does it working asynchronously ?
[02:07:26] <Domo> it could be other windows are accessible while that is running
[02:07:36] <rdbeni0> let me check
[02:07:43] <rdbeni0> i will copy and try your solution
[02:07:46] <Domo> (notmuch cannot be used (apart writing message)) while that is running as it locks the database)
[02:09:03] <rdbeni0> its working
[02:09:18] <rdbeni0> its spawning new buffer "my notmuch polls"
[02:10:11] <rdbeni0> ok hmm
[02:10:17] <rdbeni0> that solution isn't bad
[02:10:27] <rdbeni0> i can check for output

[02:10:55] <rdbeni0> thank you Domo !
[02:13:55] <rdbeni0> ok next question
[02:14:01] <rdbeni0> in notmuch pre or post hooks
[02:14:18] <rdbeni0> pre-new
[02:14:19] <rdbeni0> or post-new
[02:14:24] <rdbeni0> should i insert mbsync -a
[02:14:35] <rdbeni0> or its bad idea? and should i keep mbsync separate?
[02:15:27] <rdbeni0> or i can just create
[02:15:41] <rdbeni0> notmuch-pull-mbsync , and use something similar like in Domo example
[02:20:42] <Domo> I don't use hooks so I don't know.
[02:21:50] <rdbeni0> Other question. notmuch search command is read only
[02:21:51] <rdbeni0> ?
[02:22:32] <rdbeni0> i am asking, because i would like to experiment with some cli arguments and tags
[02:22:48] <rdbeni0> like tag:trash

[02:57:56] <acdw> honestly mbsync's manpage is pretty good imo, or i read one of the many tutorials online
[03:00:36] <rdbeni0> currently my only concern is how to implement "delete" correctly in gmail... we have complicated terminology like "expunge", "D flag", "move to trash", Sync all... and also "recommended" settings for gmail
[03:01:02] <rdbeni0> it's little nightmare
[03:03:26] <rdbeni0> i will implement tag:trash in "notmuch" and action mv based on that flag: mv to Bin directory for all files with tag=trash
[03:03:55] <rdbeni0> does it make sense?
[03:08:34] <acdw> i think so? idk lol
[03:31:07] <bremner> rdbeni0: "notmuch search" is read-only. It does not change anything on the disk
[03:31:16] <rdbeni0> ok, thanks
[03:35:44] <bremner> notmuch commands will only rename files (or create them in the case of insert) or change the database
[03:36:00] *** Joins: gast0n (~g4570n@user/gast0n)

[03:39:03] <bremner> I don't know enough about mbsync to comment.
[03:39:36] <rdbeni0> ok, which synchronization app are you using?
[03:39:54] <rdbeni0> OfflineIMAP ?

[07:43:46] <olly> indeed - my surprise was that notmuch might be in /usr/sbin, not that /usr/sbin exists
[07:46:35] <olly> traditionally the "sbin"s are not on PATH for users, only for root (Debian is indeed like that - it's set based on [ "$(id -u)" -eq 0 ] in /etc/profile)
[08:04:39] <olly> FHS says "Utilities used for system administration (and other root-only commands) are stored in /sbin, /usr/sbin, and /usr/local/sbin."
[08:04:48] <olly> and "Deciding what things go into "sbin" directories is simple: if a normal (not a system administrator) user will ever run it directly, then it must be placed in one of the "bin" directories. Ordinary users should not have to place any of the sbin directories in their path."

[20:41:43] <rdbeni0> hi all, i have something like that : in my el files
[20:41:44] <rdbeni0> https://imgur.com/EqDmYM4.png
[20:41:59] <rdbeni0> but notmuch-hello-sections is ignored after my startup
[20:42:10] <rdbeni0> i need to manually "eval buffer" and  after that this is working
[20:42:35] <acdw> oooh backports
[20:42:40] <acdw> how does one ... install backport
[20:42:47] * acdw looks at debian whatever
[20:42:56] <bremner> acdw: backports.debian.org has lines you can copy-pasta
[20:43:06] <acdw> thank you :)
[20:43:34] <bremner> rdbeni0: sorry, no idea about use-package personally.
[20:43:48] <bremner> unpopular opinion: just use customize.
[20:44:15] <acdw> :O
[20:45:25] <acdw> rdbeni0 : things in the :Config section are evaluated /after/ the package is loaded. you probably want to eval that stuff /before/ the package is loaded. change :config to :init
[20:45:38] <rdbeni0> ok i will try
[20:46:16] <acdw> good luck!
[20:52:28] <rdbeni0> not working, how can i customize notmuch-hello-section manually? via setq or setq-default? its strange ,because all other part of my config is working
[20:53:48] <acdw> setq and setq-default are pretty much the same, except some variables are buffer-local. that's weird, it should work
[20:54:02] <bremner> M-x customize-variable <return>notmuch-hello-sections<return>
[20:54:07] <bremner> is another option
[20:54:14] <acdw> ^ that works well as well
[20:54:15] <rdbeni0> ok
[20:54:17] <rdbeni0> got the issue
[20:54:43] <rdbeni0> in my  custom.el i had already "(notmuch-hello-sections

[20:54:50] <rdbeni0> i missed that
[20:54:54] <rdbeni0> ok thanks, nevermind
[20:58:21] <rdbeni0> btw M-x customize is not bad, maybe in some day i will migrate all variables from use-package into that mechanism

[21:45:34] <rdbeni0> so i still have font problems but there is progress
[21:46:18] <rdbeni0> is not that easy to fix it, but probably this package will cover all glitches
[21:46:20] <rdbeni0> https://github.com/rolandwalker/unicode-fonts
[21:46:45] <bremner> what specific kind of codepoints (characters) are problematic?

[21:47:55] <rdbeni0> https://codepoints.net/U+1F181?lang=en
[21:48:08] <rdbeni0> but there is progress, after that configuration:
[21:48:35] <rdbeni0> https://i.imgur.com/i6dNjzp.png
[21:49:01] <rdbeni0> 80% of missing characters started to be visible
[21:49:04] <rdbeni0> there is still 20%
[21:49:09] <rdbeni0> missing
[21:49:10] <rdbeni0> so
[21:49:22] <rdbeni0> i think that package: unicode-fonts , will cover all missing characters
[21:49:59] <rdbeni0> this is also important
[21:50:00] <rdbeni0> (setq use-default-font-for-symbols nil)
[21:50:29] <rdbeni0> without that, as i understand, emacs is trying to use default font to render "symbols"
[21:50:38] <rdbeni0> default value is t
[21:51:14] <bremner> you can probably get better help in #emacs about that. It doesn't seem to be notmuch specific?
