[02:25:05] <FlorianBad> Is it evil to combine `position:absolute;left:0;` with `margin-left:something` ? It seems like the margin is added to the left:0, but is it guaranteed to be consistent across browsers?
[02:52:16] <stenno> you can give a negative value to left i think
[02:52:34] <stenno> but that wouldn't be the same thing
[02:54:11] <stenno> FlorianBad: should be fine
[02:54:37] <FlorianBad> ok cool :)
[02:54:39] <FlorianBad> thanks
[02:56:49] <pavonia> I would never rely on anything being consistent across *all* browsers without testing
[02:57:03] <stenno> fair fair
[02:57:05] <stenno> of course
[02:58:31] <drej> i wouldnt worry about basic things like positioning
[02:58:37] <drej> its not 2005 any more
[03:04:37] <stenno> its super way past my bedtime but i am currently mind-blown by something
[03:04:54] <drej> by the fact that it's no longer 2005?
[03:05:10] <stenno> https://jsfiddle.net/xhL7u9bv/ here i would have assumed that left: 0 of .zomg would be relative to .foo, but apparently its relative to .bar
[03:06:09] <drej> yup
[03:06:18] <stenno> is it because of the margin-left of .bar ?
[03:06:23] <drej> once you make the parent absolute, it's removed from the document flow
[03:06:28] <stenno> yes
[03:06:29] <drej> which means taht all its children are now contained within it
[03:06:32] <stenno> thats why i am confused
[03:06:32] <drej> and relative to it
[03:06:35] <stenno> ooh
[03:07:26] <drej> see point #3 on this page: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-the-position-property-in-css-to-align-elements-d8f49c403a26/
[03:07:28] <drej> sums it up nicely
[03:08:31] <stenno> drej: but its ambigous here
[03:08:33] <stenno> Since position: absolute removes the element from the document flow, other elements are affected and behave as the element is removed completely from the webpage.
[03:08:52] <drej> i guess its not ambigous if you know what they're trying to say lol
[03:08:59] <drej> ambiguous
[03:09:02] <stenno> so this must be 'elements that are not children' are affected
[03:09:08] <stenno> ambiguous
[03:09:09] <drej> correct, the other elements on the page
[03:09:12] <stenno> sorry, not a native speaker
[03:09:14] <drej> me either
[03:09:19] <drej> all good <3
[03:09:22] <stenno> :)
[03:10:30] <stenno> later:
[03:10:35] <stenno> The coordinates of an absolute positioned element are relative to its parent if the parent also has a non-static position.
[03:10:48] <stenno> i guess that says it explicitely
[03:11:50] <stenno> works as expected with .bar being static https://jsfiddle.net/xhL7u9bv/1/
[03:12:38] <drej> why use margin-left in this case instead of just left: btw ?
[03:13:10] <stenno> see FlorianBad 's question
[03:13:25] <stenno> its not exactly the same right
[03:13:32] <drej> it is exactly the same
[03:13:40] <drej> in as much as left:  10px would be exactly the same
[03:13:43] <drej> except ... proper
[03:13:44] <stenno> left: 10 + margin-left: 10 is not the same as left: 20 / margin-left: 20
[03:13:55] <drej> because youre not setting a margin, you're setting position in this case
[03:14:10] <stenno> well yeah in this specific case
[03:14:17] <stenno> it was just a silly testcase
[03:14:45] <stenno> wanted to test some behavior which led to my above question
[03:14:52] <drej> left: 10px; margin-left: 10px; would be the exact same as left: 20px;
[03:14:57] <drej> or margin-left: 20px
[03:15:10] <drej> in an absolutely positioned element that is
[03:15:19] <FlorianBad> drej: it's complicated, but basically I build a library where a menu can slide open and animate all element that have a class called 'menu-glue'. It does that by animating their margin-left. The thing is, on some of these I will also need to use `position:absolute;left:0;' so that animated margin-left must add to the original left of the element.
[03:15:21] <drej> but you will run into some interesting things if you try setting lets say a top margin
[03:15:38] <drej> FlorianBad: i would suggest you animate an offset instead then
[03:15:48] <stenno> i assume absolute elements will never collapse margins?
[03:15:55] <stenno> absolutely positioned elements
[03:16:06] <stenno> doesn't really make sense
[03:16:21] <drej> i vaguely rememebr some issues w/ top margins having a weird bug even with abs positioned elements and parent elements' backgrouns
[03:16:28] <drej> but that might be old foggy brain
[03:16:29] <stenno> Note that the margins of floating and absolutely positioned elements never collapse.
[03:16:44] <stenno> ok fair
[03:16:45] <drej> anyway, in this case, i would not animate a margin anyway
[03:16:50] <drej> i would use a transform
[03:17:16] <stenno> hm margin doesn't matter for box-model
[03:17:25] <FlorianBad> drej: hmm, offset.... why?
[03:17:34] <drej> transform: translatex(200px);
[03:17:37] <drej> because its GPU accelerated
[03:17:42] <drej> you'll get better performance
[03:18:01] <drej> when you use a transform, the browser caches that pane and doesnt have to re-render it
[03:18:04] <FlorianBad> hmmmm very interesting, especially since these some of these animated wrappers will contain entire pages, which could be huge
[03:18:08] <drej> where as with margin it will re-render each step along the way
[03:18:17] <drej> then you'll almost certainly benefit from transform
[03:18:19] <drej> rather than margin
[03:19:48] <FlorianBad> ok, awesome, thanks a lot drej
[03:19:50] <drej> stenno: https://jsfiddle.net/2u4Lgtsc/
[03:19:54] <drej> that'll break your brain a little
[03:20:06] <stenno> drej: just found this one http://jsfiddle.net/audetwebdesign/WQA6B/
[03:20:07] <drej> parent is the one w/ the background color, why doesnt it render the red above the child ?
[03:20:13] <drej> :)
[03:20:24] <drej> if "margin doesn't matter for box-model"
[03:20:53] <drej> now, add a border-top to the parent
[03:20:56] <drej> without changing the margin
[03:21:01] <drej> :mind-blown:
[03:21:09] <stenno> huh
[03:21:39] <stenno> ok
[03:22:05] <drej> and if you used relative position and top: 10px;
[03:22:05] * stenno sets border-box
[03:22:07] <drej> on the child instead
[03:22:15] <drej> then it would work just fine
[03:22:20] <drej> border box i think wouldnt fix this either, iirc
[03:22:23] <drej> its been a while
[03:22:30] <drej> ive been doing this since 1996
[03:22:34] <drej> some things get forgotten lol
[03:22:45] <FlorianBad> drej: oh but wait.... that cannot work, translate is very different than a margin... margin-left won't touch the margin-right, translate will move the whole thing
[03:22:53] <stenno> yeah border-box doesn't chage it
[03:23:41] <stenno> drej: what is this now lol https://jsfiddle.net/2u4Lgtsc/
[03:23:44] <drej> FlorianBad: sorry i didnt actually see a testcase of what you're trying to do
[03:23:45] <stenno> actually i should just sleep
[03:23:52] <stenno> disregard
[03:23:56] <stenno> i'll ask tomorrow
[03:23:58] <drej> gnite stenno
[03:24:06] <stenno> night
[03:25:04] <FlorianBad> drej: just a page with a width that shrinks as menu opens. Menu animates the margin-left of whatever has the glue class. Is there a GPU-friendly version of margin-left then? (meaning that the width shrinks as margin increases)

[03:47:42] <drej> no FlorianBad
[03:47:50] <drej> why not just push the whole page over with the menu expanded
[03:47:54] <drej> or overlap the content with the menu
[03:48:33] <drej> if you adjust the margin and animate it as the menu is coming in, not only does it have to re-render the margin, but the entirety of every element in that content container to continue to redraw it in the various steps of the animation
[03:48:43] <drej> that will be so taxing client side and will likely stutter like crazy
[03:49:03] <drej> here's an approach i did: https://schmopera.com/
[03:49:09] <drej> so click the hamburger menu on the top left
[03:49:49] <drej> that whole site is probably the most optimized site you'll see - both client side and page performance
[03:51:23] <drej> FlorianBad: if you absolutely need to expand the menu and make room for it in an open state then my recommendation would be to not animate it
[03:51:30] <drej> that way you have only one redraw state
[03:53:03] <FlorianBad> ok. Yeah I do have to change the width
[03:53:07] <FlorianBad> unfortunately
[03:53:46] <drej> you could still use transform, use javascript to wait until the transition happens, then resize the content container when its done
[03:53:52] <FlorianBad> I will test and see what happens when my page has a gigantic table of 2000 rows or something... but I'll probably come to the conclusion that I should just remove the animation. Or one thing I can do is animate based on innerHTML.length
[03:54:15] <drej> you'll have a flash of content being shifted around at the end which is kinda ghetto but would still be better than jittering the hell out of it
[03:54:35] <drej> yeah it will definitely run laggy as hell if youre resizing 2000 row table on the fly as the animation is happening
[03:54:36] <drej> thats a disaster
[03:54:43] <drej> hell it will likely stutter with 20 row table
[03:54:57] <FlorianBad> drej: hmm, well in that case I don't need js, I can do that with animate and NOT animate the width, yet still use a width style for from and to
[03:55:11] <drej> the point is you dont want to animate the width
[03:55:19] <FlorianBad> yeah
[03:55:25] <drej> you want to animate the menu movnig across and pushing everything, then when its done, snap the width in one redraw
[03:55:32] <drej> thats what i was suggesting
[03:55:40] <drej> it's hacky but it might be an option if you absolutely want to animate

[13:00:07] <stenno> there must have been something else
[13:00:34] <undefined_bob> stenno: maybe he talked mean about sass or even scss? :O
[13:00:54] <stenno> people complain about bootstrap almost every day in here
[13:01:13] <theskillwithin> stenno you don't believe me? ask AMC or wtver
[13:01:16] <stenno> you have to do _quite_ some things to get banned here actually
[13:01:54] <stenno> sure i will ask him
[13:02:07] <stenno> 'was theskillwithin banned from #css because he doesn't like bootstrap'
[13:02:34] <theskillwithin> =]
[13:02:57] <undefined_bob> no one should like bootstrap because its just so annoying :(
[13:03:01] <stenno> 'was theskillwithin banned from #css because he doesn't like css frameworks'
[13:03:20] <theskillwithin> im okay with css frameworks sometimes
[13:03:30] <stenno> tons of people in here don't use any frameworks
[13:03:33] <theskillwithin> i just think not good to learn css
[13:03:36] <stenno> yet they don't get ban
[13:03:38] <stenno> ned
[13:03:59] <undefined_bob> maybe he used swear words?
[13:04:02] <theskillwithin> i was asked to stop recommeding a pure css way isntead of bootcrap stenno
[13:04:12] <stenno> theskillwithin: and you just continued anyway?
[13:04:19] <theskillwithin> stenno yes
[13:04:23] <stenno> also bootstrap is pure css
[13:04:41] <stenno> ah well that explains it then
[13:04:51] <theskillwithin> i feel like, if i can't tell how to do in pure css.  then why are we here
[13:05:12] <stenno> so you were banned for ignoring the ops wish to stop
[13:05:29] <stenno> yeah i have an idea now what happened when you got banned
[13:05:30] <theskillwithin> yes, i was younger then, and dumb then.  but yes
[13:06:14] <theskillwithin> stenno you wouldn't do that to me, i feel like
[13:06:25] <stenno> bootstrap is just a css file
[13:06:31] <stenno> you can literally look up how they did it
[13:06:35] <stenno> bootstrap is pure css
[13:07:38] <theskillwithin> well
[13:07:59] <theskillwithin> but i don't like people usting bootstrap as a crutch instead of learning css
[13:08:32] <theskillwithin> learning bootstrap isn't much harder than just learning css
[13:08:46] <theskillwithin> you can learn to make your own layout from scratch

[13:09:13] <theskillwithin> which in professional life you will need to do
[13:09:19] <theskillwithin> you get a design
[13:09:30] <theskillwithin> and make the css from scratch, layout and all
[13:09:43] <theskillwithin> and its not that hard
[13:12:18] <theskillwithin> btw if you use bootstrap, i don't have hard feelings
[13:12:25] <hassoon> bootstrap is meant for frontend-illiterate people
[13:12:44] <hassoon> they just have to know the right class to use for a given element/container
[13:14:35] <stenno> thats not correct lol
[13:15:19] <theskillwithin> im totally okay if you use bootstrap
[13:15:32] <theskillwithin> just don't pretend your learning real css
[13:16:12] <stenno> bootstrap is real css
[13:16:47] <theskillwithin> how about learn css before you use a freamwork.  maybe u can agree there
[13:17:14] <theskillwithin> if you don't want to learn css, then thats fine
[13:17:25] <stenno> define 'learning css'
[13:17:38] <stenno> i am using css for like 15 years now i still don't know eveything
[13:17:43] <stenno> more like 20 years
[13:18:00] <undefined_bob> learn harder
[13:19:28] <theskillwithin> same
[13:19:51] <theskillwithin> i just learned accent-color recently
[13:20:08] <theskillwithin> gunna make massive difference in sites i make
[13:22:07] <hassoon> stenno: what is not correct about that ?
[13:22:11] <theskillwithin> stenno you know the difference between someone slapping on classes, and someone who knows what they mean
[13:22:32] <hassoon> stenno: bootstrap is easy and sane to use for that category of people
[13:23:00] <hassoon> stenno: you use col-<whatever> and your element is well aligned
[13:23:23] <theskillwithin> slapping on classes is really in the end harder
[13:23:52] <theskillwithin> cuz now ur trying to re-tweak shit to make it more specific
[13:24:16] <theskillwithin> when if you just knew css in the first place, woulda been no problem
[13:26:00] <theskillwithin> plz don't ban me again
[13:28:40] <hassoon> theskillwithin: nah freenode's staff have changed

[22:14:27] <teut> why is that report jumping out to the other component?
[22:14:46] *** Quits: lilmonkey` (~lilmonkey@user/lilmonkey) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[22:15:03] <hassoon> ah ok
[22:15:09] <teut> why doesnt its div expands?
[22:15:49] <teut> its react otherwise I could esxplain
[22:15:52] <teut> explain
[22:15:57] <hassoon> teut: just set display:flex on the parent of the img/report, and it will take the size it needs without expanding out of its container
[22:16:42] <teut> but I didnt specify any height on the container
[22:16:49] <hassoon> teut:
[22:16:59] <hassoon> doesn't matter
[22:17:05] <hassoon> flexbox will fix things for you
[22:17:30] <hassoon> it will give spaces to its items nice and clean
[22:17:42] <teut> I want to know the reason so that I can understand css better
[22:18:21] <teut> oh oh , its a png
[22:18:39] <teut> but no , that isnt a logic
[22:19:08] <teut> I already know a fix that is to remove width=100%
[22:19:23] <teut> came here just for the  reasoning
[22:20:46] <hassoon> teut: you gave the img a height:auto
[22:21:07] <teut> hmm, maybe material ui gave it
[22:21:15] <teut> let me uncheck it and see
[22:21:58] <hassoon> teut: and the parent of the img does not have a height
[22:22:09] <teut> so in that case whats the css rule?
[22:22:19] <teut> doesnt the container expands?
[22:22:34] <hassoon> teut: the parent of the img needs to have a defined height, that's it

[22:23:42] <teut> img  and input fields , really leaches out blood still
[22:24:10] <hassoon> teut: i told you, the container of yout img or input fields or whatever need to have defined height
[22:24:22] <teut> hasson , is this written on mdn?
[22:24:29] <teut> hassoon  * sorry
[22:24:31] <hassoon> teut: otherwise, ultimately use the flexbox mayout, it takes care of all of that resizing logic for you
[22:25:14] <teut> ya, I actually used that but then the image became too big
[22:25:22] <hassoon> teut: mdn ? no need , just see for yourself, try to set a height for the parent of your img
[22:25:48] <hassoon> teut: if you want the height to be 100%, you need to set the height for all the ancestors as well to be 100%
[22:25:52] <teut> so , to learn  css is the only way to experiment?
[22:25:59] <teut> css,  *
[22:26:11] <hassoon> teut: sure experience and observation are your friens
[22:26:17] <teut> hmm
[22:26:36] <teut> thanks, with what you told and width=90% , I get what I wanted
[22:29:38] <hassoon> teut: nope, use the flexbox instead
[22:29:51] <teut> yes flexbox + width 90
[22:30:30] <hassoon> teut: your approach was true just because giving widh:90% to the img will make the height smaller as a consequence of decreasing the width, with regard to the image ration that's all
[22:30:35] <hassoon> teut: ah ok whatever
[22:31:39] <teut> below the report there is that blue strip
[22:32:05] <teut> I need to that kind of effect where when we scroll the background behaves sticky
[22:32:29] <teut> let me find some site that does it
[22:32:40] <teut> behaves fixed
[22:34:31] <teut> nvm, it was background-attachment property
