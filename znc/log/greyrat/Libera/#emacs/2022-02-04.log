[00:46:30] <technomancy> they got a bunch of funding to add it so who knows

[00:48:46] <thuna`> aidalgol: What does "low-tech" mean in this context?
[00:48:48] <TRS-80> So, fundamentally, sr.ht promotes a traditional email patch workflow (as opposed to this 'PR' nonsense).  As a reaction to M$ buying GitHub, and taking what was fundamentally a de-centralized thing (git) and turning into a platform that they can control (platform control being all the rage nowadays).  https://drewdevault.com/2020/08/27/Microsoft-plays-their-hand.html

[01:08:08] <wgreenhouse> not everyone uses melpa, or use-package
[01:08:19] <grym> TRS-80: we could also admit that email is *just kind of weird, actually*
[01:08:27] <technomancy> aidalgol: I would change my stance if the complexity were lowered to a level where a group of people roughly the size of the emacs developer team could implement a browser.
[01:08:33] <Bayes> wgreenhouse well that's my question, isn't melpa a way to distribution packages and not stand alone apps?
[01:08:51] <Diablo-D3> melpa is a way to distribute elisp
[01:09:11] <wgreenhouse> Bayes: "in the same way that for example Gnus is"
[01:09:24] <Diablo-D3> there are apps that are literally "emacs -flags foo.el"
[01:09:34] <Bayes> hm
[01:09:42] <aidalgol> technomancy: You know, some things are just inherently complex.
[01:09:47] <Diablo-D3> so I dont know why you *couldnt* put them on melpa
[01:09:48] <wgreenhouse> Bayes: Gnus being an example of an emacs package that encompasses multiple major and minor modes
[01:10:07] <ggb> aidalgol: So far as I know that line was just from my brain, though it may be inspired by or unconsciously stolen from some other source.
[01:10:11] <technomancy> aidalgol: then we're better off without them.
[01:10:23] <Bayes> okay, when I tried to do install-package ebib I got an error about not finding parsebib on melpa so I thought it was a standalone app to install via pacman or some
[01:10:24] <aidalgol> technomancy: So... game engines are bad, too?

[01:31:36] <ski> rudybot_: are you a people problem, or a machine problem ?
[01:31:41] <rudybot_> ski: machine learning and most Maximum Likelihood estimations have been programmed efficiently for certain commonly occuring problems, like linear regression and logistic regresion. Writing the code for another type of problem is very difficult to solve with ML or MLE, so people who are looking for good/best models use MCMC, and are prepared to wait

[01:50:52] <TRS-80> So, if you want to play YouTube on Kodi, all the plug-ins require an API key.  However, if you look up video first on your Androif phone in NewPipe, you can do 'send to Kodi' which Just Works(tm).  Because apparently the metadata scraping is the part that needs an API key.  Same reason that trailers also 'just work' (without an API key) because the URL comes from whatever site they scraped that
[01:50:54] <TRS-80> from.

[01:55:39] <johnjaye> TRS-80: does kodi play more things than vlc? vlc as much as i hate the interface is still my "go-to" for a cross platform media player
[01:56:43] <TRS-80> johnjaye: I would guess they are similarly wide in what they play.  However Kodi is designed for '10 foot interface' (i.e., TV in living room, remote) where vlc is a regular desktop program.

[02:59:10] <johnjaye> dunno, just a vague feeling
[02:59:10] <johnjaye> so is the reality that rpi are *not* open source friendly and odroid is?
[02:59:18] <TRS-80> johnjaye: The reality is that there is wide difference between vendors in not only hardware quality, but vendor support, and even commitment to F/LOSS / openness
[02:59:35] <aidalgol> TRS-80: When you say "open source," do you really mean "free software"?
[02:59:38] <johnjaye> i see. and where do i go to learn more about it?

[03:00:25] <TRS-80> johnjaye: yep
[03:01:03] <TRS-80> So the tradeoff, once you wander off RPi plantation, is that there is more interesting hardware, but support can vary widely.  Unlike RPi which is pretty well supported.
[03:01:31] <TRS-80> So, just do some homework, stick with better supported devices, and you will be fine.  :)

[03:06:37] <johnjaye> TRS-80: i mean i realize the firmware is not free software on the raspi. but saying they aren't friendly to foss seems to be a big larger claim than just that
[03:06:41] <johnjaye> that's what i mean
[03:06:49] <TRS-80> aidalgol: Look up threads on e.g., Phoronix about LibreSoC and you will get the whole story.
[03:06:54] <johnjaye> *much bigger and larger claim
[03:06:59] <catern> is there a way to do multiple query-replaces at the same time? e.g. in my case I want to replace "threads" with "processes" and "thread" with "process" (i.e. have correct pluralization)
[03:07:44] <TRS-80> They are 'friendly to F/LOSS' in the same way M$ (and many others) are, which is to say in a fake way because it's good for them and good for business, no real comittment to actual Freedom.
[03:08:11] <johnjaye> you could apply the same criticism to redhat or canonical no?
[03:08:13] <TRS-80> catern: With a regexp?
[03:08:23] <johnjaye> they're just there to profit, they don't really care about gpl
[03:08:37] <catern> TRS-80: how would I do that?
[03:08:52] <aidalgol> Hmm, I don't think the RISC-V was ever pretending to be anything more than an open-source ISA, and that it was free software enthusiasts who spread the idea that it meant the dawn of a golden age of fully open SoCs.
[03:08:56] <catern> replaces x with y and xs with yes?
[03:09:09] <aidalgol> catern: C-M-%
[03:09:23] <TRS-80> johnjaye: There is that, and then there is going out of your way to be anti-freedom.  Somehow I characterize M$ and Broadcom as the latter, due to their actions.

[03:12:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Unfortunately the current model for things like Qubes really doesn't work well with low-powe hardware like early version of that will be.
[03:12:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> OSes still lag behind what Plan9 had.
[03:12:38] <aidalgol> TRS-80: This is how hyping projects for what you *hope* they will be can harm said project, because you're setting up not just yourself but others for disappointment, based on promises the project never made.
[03:12:51] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I can roughly emulate it with Xpra but... Xpra is not meant for that sort of use.

[03:14:31] <TRS-80> johnjaye: Like Broadcom whole nonsense about releasing opensource GPU drivers for RPi, was a tiny opensource stub, when all the real stuff happens down in their proprietary realtime OS/bootloader/GPU.  Just totally bullshit and marketing.

[03:17:33] <TRS-80> it's really that

[03:21:08] <johnjaye> in cs theory isn't something that always answers yes/no questions an "oracle" or something?

[03:28:00] <TRS-80> yeap
[03:28:50] <johnjaye> the first phoronix thread i came up with about riscv and libresoc is mostly accusations and counter accusations about things i know little about

[18:25:37] <bpalmer> thuna`: in practice, the last resort when dealing with copyright is going to be one or both of public opinion or a legal proceeding, both of which allow you to pile non-conclusive evidence and allow whoever is judging the fact to believe you (or not)
[18:26:12] <bpalmer> thuna`: so things like having rough drafts, public commit logs, etc may actually be *more* believable than simply "I have this registered with the copyright office"

[18:27:45] <bpalmer> at any rate. IANAL, so this is all supposition and hearsay and induced barratry or what have you.

[21:59:21] <xheimlich> someone posted a pairwise recursive answer.
[21:59:58] <xheimlich> sure, but if you're going to do do that, then isn't it better to sort and find the first positive element?
[22:00:39] <ggb> Better to sort = N logN + other stuff
[22:00:52] <xheimlich> (well, not strictly; sorting in the lines of that recursive solution builds out a list we don't need. but assuming fast sorting codes.)
[22:01:19] <ggb> You could radix sort and get N + other stuff.
[22:01:41] <ggb> I don't see how you can get to less than O(N) on this.

[22:02:58] <xheimlich> there's also the issue of stability.
[22:02:58] <ggb> It seems to me that the proper optimizations would be those that help with branch prediction. Hit rate on that is going to be awful with randomly distributed list elements.
[22:03:16] <xheimlich> assume the list is [x*sin(x) for x in range(999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999)]

[22:04:38] <fsbot> I am feeling a bit perturbed at your attitude.
[22:04:59] <xheimlich> yes, but maybe the computer gets cosmic rays and makes random mistakes.

[23:49:11] <bremner> yeah, discord would make me drop a project like a hot potato, but to each their own

Forty-thousand, counting affiliates, and twenty-thousand more, not organized, but ready to fight: 60,000 soldiers! Now, there ain't but 20,000 police in the whole town. Can you dig it?"
[23:49:53] <aidalgol> bremner: Unfortunately, pragmatism has forced me to relent on that stance.

[23:51:14] <judybot> artefact: your privacy doesn't affect them? Mauricio y have a look? It's amazing how "blogging people" have no fear of google and have no reason to put a mini 870 in it!
[23:51:17] <aidalgol> bremner: As in there is some really good free software out there that I would have to simply not use if I refused to use anything whose community is primarily on Discord.
[23:51:20] <tatsumaru> for some reason emacs doesn't automatically load clojure-mode when I open clojure files
[23:51:27] <TRS-80> bremner: it's getting more and more popular, unfortunately, some projects even using it exclusively like Voron
[23:51:39] <bremner> I guess I'm just lucky
[23:51:43] <chrisb> right, i get it when you are developing, otherwise you can't keep track of what's shadowed, non-standard, etc.
[23:51:47] <aidalgol> TRS-80: wth is Voron?
[23:51:51] <artefact> to the younger ones discord is probably like github to us
[23:51:57] <artefact> aidalgol: a corexy 3d printer
[23:51:58] <Catie> Same with LuxCore, they're only on Discord
[23:52:02] <bremner> artefact: hateful?
[23:52:13] <aidalgol> I'm surprised I don't see many FOSS projects using RocketChat.

[23:52:16] <judybot> acdw: I'm a visual artist and my background is graphic design. I believe in pushing the boundaries and exploring new media to see what we can get away with. I love creating with software, and have been inventing a new digital, architectural and digital art style using these strange new-to-me tools (VR/AR/CW visuals, CAD, 3D
[23:52:17] <TRS-80> aidalgol: I am right behind you and I really don't like it.  Voron is a very nice community based 3d printer project I am thinking about building.
[23:52:19] <artefact> a thing that's ubiquitous and taken for granted
[23:52:36] <acdw> judybot: an extremely cold take is
[23:52:37] <judybot> acdw: a terrorist? Let’s say there is a North Korean Missile lodged 20km from a Japanese city. The US has no choice but to be so hellbent on ‘decapitating’ gulags that they are willing to do the entire ‘ population out reactor’ operations long before they agree that one single NKern Lied gangster can once again stand.

[23:53:55] <wgreenhouse> > I'm surprised I don't see many FOSS projects using RocketChat.
[23:53:55] <wgreenhouse> aidalgol: that would involve someone hosting it. presumably that's half the issue--projects not wanting to sysadmin their chat
[23:54:18] <TRS-80> > what is libera (or OFTC, or ...)
[23:54:25] <Catie> aidalgol: It was very minor, but I do consider it my crowning achievement thus far
[23:54:25] <TRS-80> real reason is Zoomers

[23:54:41] <TRS-80> ooh shiny GUI
[23:54:43] <acdw> lol nope, sario
[23:54:43] <wgreenhouse> TRS-80: rocketchat is self-hosted. so it's not shared infra

[23:55:20] <Sario> Ahh yes, the best one
[23:55:24] <Catie> aidalgol: Ooh, these are gorgeous!
[23:55:30] <acdw> ahahahah
[23:55:31] <acdw> it's a good one
[23:55:36] <TRS-80> no, Discord is completely proprietary and centralized

[23:56:11] <aidalgol> TRS-80: I mean a project using Discord for their chat is similarly easy to using Libera or OFTC.
[23:56:21] <aidalgol> Whereas RocketChat requires you host your own instance.
[23:56:23] <artefact> in the end it all comes down to the reliability/availability of a federated system. it's why email/SMS is still king
[23:56:46] <acdw> anybody tried deltachat? i did but wasn't a fan ultimately

[23:58:38] <wgreenhouse> *it
[23:59:54] <TRS-80> aidalgol: technically true of course, I guess those are just not the first axes that come to my mind
