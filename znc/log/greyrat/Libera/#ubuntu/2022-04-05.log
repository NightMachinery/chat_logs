[08:52:30] <Unit193> Well, next LTS will be out pretty soon, seems best to just wait for that at this point.
[08:53:05] <FaTaL_gg> lotuspsychje, I agree in principal and practice. Im only questioning it because some of the fixed bugs are noteworthy (memory corruption, connection failures, and systemctl service restart issue due to pid file permissions).... seems "dumb" that these fixes would not be pulled in (which prompted my coming here). I can live until next LTS, I've dealt with it this long. But still curious why it
[08:53:06] <FaTaL_gg> wouldnt be included and updated.
[08:55:02] <conjo> lotuspsychje, would you mind helping me please? i dont use cups and use ufw but only "sudo enable ufw". Im not advanced re firewalls or ports, but ufw seems to have a rule or profile for cups service(im unsure which)
[08:55:23] <FaTaL_gg> Unit193, yea, kind of what I was thinking before even asking the question. just strange (See 1.3.6d): http://proftpd.org/docs/NEWS-1.3.6d
[08:56:29] <FaTaL_gg> those updates were released in 2020! .... so its been just about 2 years, and it was not updated in that time.
[08:56:30] <conjo> "sudo ufw app info CUPS" returns a brief description of what cups is and some of protocols supported then a mention of tcp/631, it doesnt state if the ports open
[08:56:38] <oerheks> sudo ufw apps list # see cups
[08:57:52] <Unit193> FaTaL_gg: As noted on the releases page, I don't see 'd' there.  http://proftpd.org/ also indicates the version in Ubuntu is current, well Jammy at least.

The snaps make it possible to deploy on almost all of our current linux systems (centos7 because Autodesk/Maya only supports RHEL) But I am trying to pull the infrastructure into the present. (we also have vm servers running fc26 and until I pushed really hard most of our FBSD servers had eol'd 11-12.x)

[22:20:06] <MaximB> Hello, I have a 4k TV monitor attached to my PC, I have user interface scaling at "Double", and many apps run fine. however some other apps like VLC for example, have a very very small and unreadable interface. increasing the font size doesn't help as it won't increase them within the app (only on the borders). what is the solution to this?
