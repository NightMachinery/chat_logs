[05:02:28] <bn_work> I think the saying goes "save/commit often", and I do save often but not commit often enough perhaps?  because I always feel like it takes time to reflect & think about what one has done to summarize the changes succinctly in a message.  Inevitably what ends up happening is I accumulate a lot of changes and I go through these "paperwork" days where I go through `git add -p ...` and file each chunk with a commit message under specific

[10:02:31] <selckin> ok so, so you can configure ~/.ssh/config to use that key with github.com, or use an ssh-agent, and ssh-add it, or somehow tell git to use that key (don't know how)

[14:11:41] <asdf28> ikke i will give you an example
[14:13:41] <asdf28> i'm working on a test build of LibreELEC.tv, a linux distro for a media center PC. compiling it takes a lot of time and hard disk space, so i'm hacking around in some config files to disable stuff i don't need
[14:14:18] <asdf28> and i don't want to have these changes merged into the master branch when i'm done
[14:15:05] <asdf28> so what i do now is manually un-stage all these config files i edited every time i commit to the master branch
[14:15:13] <asdf28> and i wonder if there's a better way to do this

[19:46:04] <imMute> xx: you do that by setting up remote tracking branches
[19:46:31] <imMute> xx: like 'git checkout whatever-feature myrepo/whatever-feature'   will create a local branch that tracks whatever-feature on your remote repo

[22:51:29] <xx> I think I know how to do these things properly now. 1) `git fetch upstream/master` 2) `git checkout master` 3) `git rebase upstream/master` 4) `git checkout myfixes` 5) `git rebase master`

[23:34:38] <gabin> what's the technically correct aliases for "branch"
[23:34:40] <gabin> label?
[23:34:43] <gabin> ref?
[23:34:52] <osse> label is not a git term
[23:34:56] <osse> all branches are refs
[23:35:21] <gabin> but "branch" seems a little ambiguous in some contexts
[23:35:48] <gabin> "Do you want me to add an arbitrarily named 'branch ref' to the commit?"
[23:36:22] <osse> sometimes the word "branch" can be used for what are technically remote tracking branches (e.g. "origin/master")

[23:36:45] <nedbat> gabin: can you say more about the context where you want aliases for branch?
[23:37:28] <gabin> A nongnu elpa contributor is considering the issue of a detached commit with a tag
[23:37:51] <gabin> i want to ask them if just putting some branch ref on it will fix the issue

[23:43:12] <gabin> actually i could put "main" there and tell them i'll reset main to where master is when i get around to it
