[00:02:34] <kompowiec> fingerpint it's pure BS. Expensive technology that does not provide adequate protection.
[00:03:02] <kompowiec> biometric security is more about identification than security.
[00:03:16] <raccoon_dog> Yeah, I think they can be lifted somewhat easily. Patterns are also known to be easy to crack since people can see the oil smudges on your screen.
[00:04:43] * LuisM14 shrugs
[00:05:06] <kompowiec> Exactly, eventually they can be copied and used in some way. However, no one will copy your password.

[00:07:27] <raccoon_dog> Heh, yeah. I think Kevin Mitnick detailed a way to exploit SMS-based two-fact.
[00:08:12] <kompowiec> The main problem is that it is very easy to spoof and contains less traces than email spoofing.
[00:09:28] <kompowiec> once an email has been correctly spoofed, you can check its true origin via the header.
[00:09:41] <raccoon_dog> Can't headers also be spoofed/faked?
[00:10:06] <kompowiec> nope. Just only the display name for the mail client.
[00:10:33] <LuisM14> any info can imo *shrug*
[00:10:58] <kompowiec> I got an email like this once and found out that this guy used this site: emkei.cz

[19:27:26] <pussipupu> "or what" is sometimes dismissive but often a simple request for information
[19:27:38] <pussipupu> It could be taken as rude but certainly not necessarily
[19:27:38] <pussipupu> I suspect this is something that varies a lot by dialect, and definitely is highly dependent on tone

[19:28:09] <pussipupu> that said I wouldn't mind bringing thou back, or ideally just importing the Finnish pronoun set
[19:28:10] <pussipupu> the angry use is most often as a response to command
[19:28:10] <pussipupu> The Latin pronoun set has at least some of the same flaws as the current English one
[19:28:10] <pussipupu> "sorry" isn't necessarily an apology incidentally

[21:52:55] <kompowiec> I used it on a daily basis until the my British teacher told me it might be a very bad idea.
[21:53:03] <kurahaupo> "thou" is considered archaic, but is still understood because it appears a lot in the King James Bible, and somewhat in the writings of William Shakespeare
[21:53:16] <kompowiec> yeah exactly
[21:53:46] <kurahaupo> whereas "vos" I would struggle to understand without reference to other (Latinate) languages
[21:54:11] <kompowiec> I used it because my native language uses it and it makes it easier for me to form my thoughts.
[21:55:23] <kurahaupo> kompowiec: The notion of distinguishing singular & plural is so strong that many US dialects have effectively reinvented it, as "you" (singular) and "y'all" (plural). 
[21:55:51] <LjL> it sounds like a very bad idea to use them in modern English because why would other people even understand "vos"? and "thou" is all of archaic, weird, potentially derogatory, potentially deity-addressing
[21:57:23] <kompowiec> well, I didn't know about it because nobody paid any attention to it, but now it comes out in tutoring.
[21:57:26] <kurahaupo> There's one notable participant in some channels here who insists on using "sie" as "a non gendered 3rd person singular pronoun", which just comes across as weird
[21:58:05] <kompowiec> i hear that xie is probably most "popula" gender-netrual pronoun (about 2%)
[21:58:12] <kompowiec> "popular"*
[21:59:01] <kompowiec> well, recently i wrote to stallman writing "thou". But he probably won't be offended, since he himself promotes the use of such neutral pronouns.
[21:59:09] <TechTest> I always thought "y'all" means "you all"
[21:59:33] <kompowiec> what about you guys? it sound like literally "tu populus" for me
[21:59:46] <kurahaupo> kompowiec: if you really find abandoning the singular/plural distinction too disruptive to your thinking, "y'all" has enough momentum that it's acceptable everywhere (but might get you marked out as "learned English in the southern US")
[22:00:26] <kurahaupo> TechTest: it can be spelled out as two words, but that doesn't change the meaning: plural you
[22:00:27] <kompowiec> i gotcha, thank... YOU (uhh)
[22:00:54] <kurahaupo> kompowiec: (you might want to note that as well)
[22:01:27] <TechTest> anyways, it sounds wrong
[22:01:40] <onmra> What about "yous" as plural of "you"?
[22:01:44] <kurahaupo> for the record, "y'all" isn't in my own native dialect, so I don't normally use it unless I'm faking a southern US accent
[22:02:29] <kompowiec> as ESL I don't know if it sounds bad or good. Good to know
[22:02:36] <kurahaupo> onmra: That's common where I come from (NZ) but considered low status
[22:02:42] <TechTest> why would you fake a US accent?

[22:05:36] <kompowiec> I never check what dialect words comes from, but in most cases it will always be US.
[22:05:41] <kurahaupo> My native accent is much closer to British than American, but Brits do an even worse job mangling place names from NZ - primarily because almost none of them have a phonemic /n/ vs /ŋ/ distinction
[22:06:24] <TechTest> I have a mixed accent
[22:06:31] <TechTest> at least that's what I've been told
[22:06:37] <onmra> Is that because they often have Maori names?
[22:06:40] <TechTest> not sure if itya good or a bad thing
[22:06:55] <kurahaupo> not surprising, as a learner from many sources
[22:07:04] <onmra> Depends, do people understand you or not? :P
[22:07:06] <kompowiec> there was such a peculiar touch in the old 60-80s movies but I forgot the name.
[22:07:33] <kompowiec> ach, right  Transatlantic accent
[22:08:15] <kurahaupo> I rather like the German English accent. It's close to British but rather clearer to my ears

[23:11:10] <chronon> It's odd that a New Zealander would pick it out as distinctive of British accent.

[23:11:53] <raccoon_dog> That is an odd pronunciation pattern, though. Consonants that are close together tend to disappear in speech -- for example, "probably" is often pronounced "pro(b)ly" in normal speech, and only enunciated fully when the speaker is asked to slow down.
[23:12:04] <raccoon_dog> So "sing-ger" sounds odd.

[23:38:05] <twb> "I couldnae shop; I wuz skint"
[23:38:12] <raccoon_dog> Ye -- that's what I said above. "didn't have" would be the more common form in the US.
[23:38:16] <kompowiec> wow, google translate does it very well with this language monster.
[23:38:17] <raccoon_dog> s/Ye/Yes
[23:38:18] <tinsoldier> r​accoon_dog meant: Yes -- that's what I said above. "didn't have" would be the more common form in the US.
[23:38:42] <chronon> I think of "I hadn't enough money" as being something my grandmother would have said. Instead of say "I didn't have enough money".
[23:38:43] <mdogg> I'd say that's true.  
[23:39:04] <raccoon_dog> Yeah, perhaps it's a more old-fashioned British English thing, and the Americanism is gaining traction over there.
[23:39:08] <kompowiec> with twb example
[23:39:29] <blkshp> You take that back
[23:39:38] <chronon> So perhap the Brits are following the huge cultural influence of American English more these days than they were in my gran's.

[23:41:04] <blkshp> I'm not sure again which words we're talking about, I could read back but no.
[23:41:30] <chronon> It's stream of consciousness. No point in reading back.
[23:41:33] <mdogg> "didn't have" vs. "hadn't"  
[23:41:47] <raccoon_dog> Well, we were discussing if "to have" is used in British English to denote possession. "I haven't any money." "I hadn't the time back then."
[23:42:01] <onmra> What about "have got"?
[23:42:11] <chronon> Eww
[23:42:15] <raccoon_dog> I definitely think that's an Americanism, yeah.
[23:42:15] <blkshp> I'd say "I haven't got any money" or more commonly "I've got no money"
[23:42:34] <raccoon_dog> What about "I don't have any money," blkshp?
[23:42:37] <mdogg> Or he'd say, "I ain't got no money."  =p
[23:42:44] <blkshp> I wouldn't say that.
[23:42:48] <mdogg> I know.. 
[23:42:50] <raccoon_dog> lol wat
[23:43:03] <chronon> I would rare ever say I have got it. I'd just say I have it.
[23:43:06] <blkshp> I wouldn't say that either
[23:43:42] <mdogg> I think I'd say, "I don't have any money."
[23:43:54] <raccoon_dog> Yeah, that's what sounds most natural to me.
[23:43:59] <chronon> Agreed.

[23:46:07] <blkshp> mdogg: why are you putting a space before your question marks... DON'T

[23:46:29] <blkshp> tuppence
[23:46:32] <mdogg> ^
[23:46:35] <mdogg> Yeah - that's what I meant.
[23:46:38] <blkshp> I know!
[23:46:40] <mdogg> lol
[23:46:58] * mdogg hangs low his American head
[23:48:00] <blkshp> xD
[23:48:29] <blkshp> We don't really use that term anymore though
[23:48:33] <blkshp> two pee.
[23:49:11] <mdogg> My mom was born in Ireland and taught me this little rhyme one Christmas:  "Christmas is coming, the goose is getting fat.  Please put a penny in the old man's hat.  If you haven't got a penny, a ha-penny will do, and if you haven't got a ha-penny then God bless you!"

[23:51:01] <blkshp> I've heard that one too :D
[23:51:36] <blkshp> Did you know though that a hapenny was half the bronze and size of a penny which was half the bronze and the size of a 2p
[23:51:47] <blkshp> 5p is half the size of a 10p
[23:51:57] <blkshp> 20p is half the size of a 50p
[23:52:01] <mdogg> Oh wow - That's interesting.
[23:52:06] <blkshp> £1 is half the size of a £2
[23:52:14] *** Joins: amahl (~amahl@dsl-jklbng12-54fbca-64.dhcp.inet.fi)
[23:52:24] <chronon> Is that size in length or volume or weight?
[23:52:26] <blkshp> I think taht;s right anyway, definitely for the 'coppers'
[23:52:36] <mdogg> I have some old Irish money from before they went to Euros but no British money.
[23:52:38] <blkshp> weight (again i think)
[23:52:49] <blkshp> neither have I!
[23:53:08] <chronon> It would certainly be convenient to be able to weigh a bag of coins and know how much it was worth.
[23:53:09] <blkshp> havent for over a year
[23:53:21] <raccoon_dog> chronon: I do think places like banks and casinos do that.
[23:53:49] <chronon> But presumably, only after separating the coins into their face values?
[23:53:58] <raccoon_dog> I think so? I'm not 100% sure.
[23:54:05] <blkshp> I dont think they're the same now.
[23:54:13] <blkshp> they're not made of bronze!
[23:54:24] <mdogg> I'm not sure either.  I have a feeling Canadian pennies weigh about the same as our American ones.
[23:55:16] <mdogg> American pennies used to be made of pure copper but I think they're mostly nickle now with a copper coating. 
[23:56:15] <chronon> I have been surprised when travelling to othe rcountries that are part of the commonwealth or that were previous colonies of Britian to find that their coinage almost exactly matches the shape and size of the UK coinage. That may not still be true, and I cannot now remember which country I noticed that in.
[23:58:44] <blkshp> Who needs cash
[23:59:05] <mdogg> I carry about $40 but I never spend it.
[23:59:12] <chronon> I like cash. It's one of the few means of payment that isn't tracable.
[23:59:20] <blkshp> I have £20 in cash in my wallet
[23:59:28] <blkshp> For your drugs obviously.
[23:59:30] <mdogg> I just use my card for everything.
[23:59:35] <chronon> I pay for everything in cash if at all possible.
[23:59:43] <mdogg> I don't like loose change in my pocket.
[23:59:51] <blkshp> chronon: why?
