[00:00:00] <bmomjian> What the code seems to be doing is converting UTF-8 bytes to the internal Perl format, doing the wrapping, then outputting them as UTF-8.
[00:01:03] <bmomjian> I guess this explains why the previous code worked as long as the wrap didn't break in the middle of a character.
[00:01:56] <mst> bmomjian: converts utf8 bytes to perl's character format, then wrapping, then conerting back to utf8, yeah
[00:02:15] <mst> bmomjian: and the failure mode is precisely why I guessed that was the explanation :D
[00:03:38] <bmomjian> Ah, nice.
[00:04:07] <bmomjian> Once I learned that Perl has its own internal character format, it made sense.
[00:04:45] <mst> you always have to go between bytes and characters where utf8 is concerned
[00:05:02] <mst> hence why rust has separate Bytes and Str types so if you make the same mistake in rust the compiler can shout at you
