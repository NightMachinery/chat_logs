[02:16:00] <e36freak> look up BASH_REMATCH in the bash manual
[02:16:04] <lavaball> is bash_rematch[] an array?
[02:16:07] <e36freak> yes

[06:20:22] <shbot> PlayerOne: bash: id: -z: invalid option
[06:20:22] <shbot> PlayerOne: id: usage: id [user]
[06:20:22] <shbot> PlayerOne: etc... ( http://ix.io/3pMj )
[06:20:32] <PlayerOne> Okay...
[06:20:43] <PlayerOne> The nonsense is: 
[06:20:45] <PlayerOne> bash: warning: command substitution: ignored null byte in input
[06:21:04] <PlayerOne> I mean, it doesn't show than on another machine
[06:21:09] <PlayerOne> Bash versions?
[06:21:11] <uplime> it means `id -unz` is printing a nul byte
[06:21:23] <PlayerOne> And why's that bad?
[06:21:27] <PlayerOne> I mean, I don't really care
[06:21:37] <PlayerOne> It fills that to a string
[06:21:52] <uplime> the nul byte is a complicated character for bash (because C), so its just ignoring it in this case
[06:22:11] <uplime> drop the -z
[06:22:24] <uplime> root@green:~# id --help | grep -- -z
[06:22:26] <uplime>   -z, --zero     delimit entries with NUL characters, not whitespace;
[06:22:26] <PlayerOne> So, if it ignores is why the heck say that every freaking time for nearly every such command?
[06:22:54] <uplime> i don't understand the question. its telling you that it was there, but it isn't going to do anything with it
[06:22:56] <PlayerOne> perl, grep, sed etc. use that \0 byte as a great separator which is very handy
[06:23:14] <PlayerOne> uplime, the issue is with +999 messages in a big script
[06:23:22] <uplime> since when does grep use it?
[06:23:25] <PlayerOne> With this warning
[06:23:34] <uplime> PlayerOne: im not sure what you want me to tell you
[06:23:56] <uplime> the answer is to not use nul bytes in command substitution
[06:23:57] <PlayerOne> https://stackoverflow.com/q/64550414/5113030
[06:24:16] <PlayerOne> uplime, the issue doesn't appear on another machine, so it's version based
[06:24:18] <uplime> thats not grep using it as a separator
[06:24:33] <PlayerOne> Why not just allow a freaking environemnt variable in BASH which would freaking hide this warning
[06:24:42] <PlayerOne> Like DONOTSHOWFCKINGWARNING=1
[06:25:13] <uplime> the issue is on all machines, the warning doesn't appear on earlier versions is what you mean

[06:26:12] *** Quits: phillbush (~phillbush@user/phillbush) (Quit: Leaving)
[06:26:43] <PlayerOne> Yes. The issue doesn't appear on other machine which is not good, but if you add a freaking functionality which may add aditional 40 characters to STDERR for each frekaing command, then at least allow a user to hide that
[06:27:13] <PlayerOne> I don't want to hide all STDERR, but only that message right
[06:27:30] <uplime> "the issue" is trying to use a nul separator in a command substituion. bash ignoring that is the same in every version. the only thing thats new is the warning
[06:27:50] *** Joins: justsomeguy (~justsomeg@user/justsomeguy)
[06:27:58] <uplime> the proper solution is to either not use command substitutions or not use nul bytes in command substitutions
[06:28:25] <PlayerOne> This is nonsense...
[06:28:33] <e36freak> chet added the warning because people kept trying to figure out why bash was silently dropping nul bytes
[06:28:36] <e36freak> and it was causing problems
[06:28:41] <e36freak> so therefore, added warning
[06:28:48] <e36freak> if you see that, it's because you're probably doing something wrong
[06:29:17] <e36freak> why are you using -z? bash strings cannot hold NUL bytes, so the command substitution just removes them and warns you about it
[06:29:32] <e36freak> if you don't want NUL bytes, don't tell id to output them. if you DO want to use them, you can't use a command substitution
[06:29:39] <uplime> PlayerOne: whats nonsense is trying to stuff a character into a feature that explicitly doesn't support that character

[06:30:51] <uplime> its been so long
[06:30:56] <PlayerOne> For exmaple, you parse a string using perl, right? You need two or 3 ouputs. A file(store replaced lines), stdout(read file) and stderr(output replaced), WHERE THIS FREAKING MESSAGE will ruin it and make a developer to change the logic where STDERR is used as output
[06:31:14] <uplime> perl is a proper programming language, bash is not a programming language
[06:31:18] <e36freak> so stop trying to capture nul bytes
[06:31:24] <PlayerOne> uplime, id appears nearly on every machine, dear
[06:31:36] <uplime> PlayerOne: that has nothing to do with anything i've said, dear
[06:31:47] <e36freak> warning was added in 4.4 iirc
[06:32:08] <PlayerOne> uplime, id appears ON EVERY MACHINE and assumes a -z usage. Without it, it adds a new line.
[06:32:14] <e36freak> PlayerOne: the string/command substitution cannot store nul bytes, whether it warns you or not. so stop using -z
[06:32:24] <e36freak> or store the output in an array or something
[06:32:26] <uplime> PlayerOne: again, it appearing on every machine has nothing to do with anything i've said

[06:40:32] <e36freak> echo "[$message] - $(id -un)@$(hostname)]"
[06:40:41] <uplime> you're making a mountain out of a mole hill. even if bash did allow nuls in $(), using a nul byte to stop a newline is just nonsense
[06:40:46] <uplime> docmax: column 0
[06:40:50] <e36freak> docmax: i'm sorry? don't understand. remove all the whitespace in front of EOF
[06:40:55] <PlayerOne> e36freak, this is nonsense...
[06:41:11] <PlayerOne> Like... what if you need that inside a string?
[06:41:11] <uplime> PlayerOne: yes, sticking nuls in $() that explicitly doesn't allow nuls is nonsense
[06:41:16] <uplime> then don't use bash
[06:41:22] <PlayerOne> ..
[06:41:24] <e36freak> bash uses C strings
[06:41:27] <e36freak> they cannot store NULs
[06:41:29] <e36freak> that's just how it is
[06:41:33] <justsomeguy> I joined this channel after this conversation started; What is the problem being discussed?
[06:41:35] <e36freak> and that's how it always has been
[06:41:38] <PlayerOne> e36freak, And this is awesome!
[06:41:50] <PlayerOne> Why then tell that THE END OF THE STRING IS \0?
[06:41:56] <uplime> its well documented that bash doesn't handle nuls. its not meant to. its not a programming language and im not sure why you're trying to treat it as one
[06:42:02] <e36freak> PlayerOne: that is how C strings work?
[06:42:03] <uplime> PlayerOne: because thats how C handles them
[06:42:09] <PlayerOne> e36freak, and everyone knows that?!
[06:42:12] <PlayerOne> That's the point!
[06:42:15] <PlayerOne> Why warning then?!
[06:42:20] <PlayerOne> This is nonsense...

[06:44:59] <PlayerOne> e36freak, thank you. At least, you are talking like a grown up.
[06:45:00] <justsomeguy> Oops, wrong function. readarray0() { IFS=$'\0' mapfile -d $'\0' -t "$@"; } ... I'm not sure this is relevant to your discussion, though.
[06:45:22] <PlayerOne> Thank you, e36freak for a normal talk, btw.
[06:45:55] <e36freak> but bitching that it's nonsense isn't going to help anything. uplime was attempting to help you work around the issue, attacking him is not productive
[06:46:04] <PlayerOne> Ha
[06:46:06] <PlayerOne> They did not.
[06:46:23] <e36freak> that's not the perspective i had
[06:46:30] <PlayerOne> They just blamed me
[06:46:56] <uplime> there are only two solutions in the way bash exists today. i listed both of them. can't help it if you don't like it shrug.png
[06:47:17] <PlayerOne> Anyways, that sucks, but I'll try to do something about it.
[06:47:46] <e36freak> i have a feeling you'll get shut down if you send something to the mailing list, but you're welcome to try
[06:48:07] <PlayerOne> I'd recommend adding an env var for that 
[06:48:23] <e36freak> which isn't a terrible idea. as of now you'd have to edit it out and recompile
[06:48:25] <PlayerOne> Where default would not show it
[06:48:27] <e36freak> worth a shot
[06:48:39] <e36freak> default's gonna show the message, i'll tell you that right now
[06:48:43] <PlayerOne> or show
[06:48:44] <uplime> chet is reasonable, im sure he will appreciate the input
[06:48:49] <e36freak> a way to turn it off might be a suggestion he's open to
[06:48:54] <uplime> but yes, the default would definitely be to show it

[06:50:19] <PlayerOne> Oh dear

[06:51:37] <e36freak> the solution i gave with multiple command substitutions is how i would have approached it right off the bat
[06:51:48] <e36freak> or i would have just used USER instead of forking id, for that matter
[06:51:49] <uplime> same here
[06:52:06] <uplime> I'd also use printf instead of echo and pass them as separate arguments
[06:52:27] <PlayerOne> I see...
[06:52:33] <PlayerOne> Stay safe, People ^^
[06:54:08] <PlayerOne> btw grep has --zero
[06:54:24] <uplime> some greps do, sure
[06:54:25] <e36freak> yes. NUL bytes are very useful sometimes
[06:54:27] <PlayerOne> GNU one
[06:54:35] <PlayerOne> That's what I'm saying
[06:54:45] <PlayerOne> Ah..
[06:54:45] <uplime> nobody disagreed they're not useful
[06:54:54] <e36freak> GNU coreutils have all kinds of options to separate with them, and they're very useful

[06:54:55] <uplime> its the only sane way of separating file paths
[06:55:00] <PlayerOne> Perhaps, I misunderstood you then
[06:55:12] <e36freak> but they're generally used in pipelines, and when you need to store the output you do it in an array, not a string
[06:55:27] <uplime> i claimed they're not useful as a way to supress newlines
[06:55:31] <e36freak> bash has the ability to take NUL-delimited streams and put them into arrays
[06:55:35] <e36freak> just not store them in strings
[06:55:53] <PlayerOne> I see
[06:56:52] <e36freak> which is arguably the more useful feature to have regardless, because when you have a nul-delimited list, it is in fact a list and should be treated as such
[06:56:56] <justsomeguy> I think that not being able to store NUL bytes in strings is surprising behaviour, but there are some workarounds. You can store an array of multiple elements, separated by NULs, and then use printf to output each element with a NUL in between. Or you can encode the string as hex before storing it. Or you can just only use it as a stream to stdin/stdout.
[06:57:15] <uplime> justsomeguy: bash is a surprising language full of inconsistencies and pitfalls
[06:57:20] <e36freak> it all depends on what you're trying to do
[06:57:28] <justsomeguy> uplime: Sure, that's true.
[06:57:50] <e36freak> and there are certainly things where "use a real language" is a perfectly legit suggestion
[06:58:05] <justsomeguy> uplime: I'd realisticly switch to python if I really care, but sometimes I have an array and want to pipe it to sort -z.
[06:58:22] <e36freak> justsomeguy: sure, and printf '%s\0' "${array[@]}" is perfect for that
[06:58:30] <justsomeguy> yep :^)
[06:58:33] <e36freak> that's not an unreasonable thing to want to do
[06:58:45] <uplime> justsomeguy: unfortunately, that's the biggest appeal of bash. its typically far easier to launch a terminal with your shell than jump into a repl and sketch out what you want to do
[06:58:58] <PlayerOne> Heck puthon's syntax, modules and more imporatant NAME CONVENTIONS
[06:58:59] <uplime> and those cases tend to lead to overly complex scripts

[14:27:21] <pj> not that I would recommend that but it's just another way to do it.
[14:28:03] <geirha> I find   cmd && ok=1   to be most readable. Assuming later you test it with .e.g if (( ok )); then
[14:29:22] <geirha> and if you don't like unset variables, or if the variable may have been used before, just initialize it at the start of the script, function or loop body

[14:59:39] <earnestly> PlayerOne: This is where you can be confused about 0 being false, but 0 also being success
[14:59:39] <shbot> PlayerOne: 0
[15:00:17] <pj> right, 0 corresponds to true or success when it's an exit code, but for calculations inside (( )) it's the opposite.
[15:00:20] <PlayerOne> earnestly, of course, in return code.
[15:00:22] <earnestly> Exit status reverses the "truthiness" of 0 and > 0 because "there are many more ways to fail than succeed".  So 0 represents success
[15:00:35] <PlayerOne> > 0 is false in return code, of course
[15:00:40] <earnestly> But under (( )), 0 is still properly false
[15:00:41] <PlayerOne> But what about (())?
[15:00:46] <PlayerOne> I see
[15:00:55] <pj> so (( )) will exit with a code of 0 if the inside calculates to non-zero and 1 if the inside calculates to 0
[15:00:56] <earnestly> So in order to use (( )) in the same terms of exit statuses, you have to reverse the condition
[15:01:22] <PlayerOne> (( ! ... ))
[15:01:35] <PlayerOne> Ah no.
[15:01:41] <PlayerOne> ! (( ... )) better

[16:57:18] <earendel> hi. it's not a bash question, and if u tell me a place where i could get helped thanks for pointing it out. everythin in linux is a file right? so when i try to run ifconfig with a normal user, at some point it will fail when trying to access a file which it can't? are rejected access trials logged somewhere so i can check?
[16:58:55] <lopid> not usually unless via sudo
[16:59:18] <lopid> but that's for the command not the file
[16:59:45] <lopid> selinux might log something like that

[17:01:03] <earendel> obviously the network-manager allows regular desktop users to manage network connections. that is possible because some daemon is running in the background with access to the the right files.. possibly even as root, correct?
[17:01:45] <lopid> maybe you just need to be in the right group
[17:02:26] <jetchisel> maybe try your OS channel or #linux 
[17:03:36] <earendel> yes yes.. right. that would be cool. im trying to find a way to know which access was blocked at what point, to check if its possible to give more rghts to some group..

[22:30:16] <user01> hi if i generate a md5 list that generates line output like: 9fa28ea6be4444df3013c38db413dea8  /home/user/Files/1 (14).doc . . . is there a way to get a list of files with unique md5 (only one in the list), and a list of files with duplicate md5?
[22:30:57] <twkm> yes.
[22:31:30] <user01> twkm, like uniq on first column or something?
[22:32:09] <jetchisel> !seen
[22:32:09] <greybot> awk '!seen[$0]++' # Remove second and subsequent instances of each input line, without having to sort them first.
[22:32:16] <twkm> i'd use awk, for both.
[22:33:12] <kenyon> user01: there are specialized tools fdupes that might be better for what you're doing
[22:35:17] <user01> kenyon, alright thanks hadnt heard of that

[23:51:14] <geirha> !urldecode
[23:51:14] <greybot> See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/071 or https://gist.github.com/887e74e74877c7613920
[23:51:50] <geirha> just an updated version
[23:52:18] <geirha> it mainly just change %FF to \xFF, and printf %b replaces \xFF with the byte with value 255
[23:52:53] <geirha> in addition + is usually equivalent to %20 aka space, so that's handled specially
