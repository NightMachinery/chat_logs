[00:41:13] <patchvonbraun[m]> Well, I will observe that working inside a 20m radome in high winds is a bit like working inside the bass drum at an AC/DC concert....

[00:42:54] <LordKalma> (or don't, not a great idea, if Takoma bridge has some lesson to teach)
[00:43:50] <patchvonbraun[m]> The space frame that the radome panels are attached to is arranged quasi-randomly to reduce resonance modes...
[00:45:30] <patchvonbraun[m]> So, overall, it's a geodesic dome, but individual sections are all somewhat "unique" in shape.

[00:56:32] <patchvonbraun[m]> The RF part of the equipment cab was serviced by a MASSIVE A/C unit, that will likely get removed.  These were the power-supplies for the probably-a-coupla-kW Klystrons or TWTs.
[00:57:43] <LordKalma> my life looks more like this: https://i.imgur.com/Hl3zyqr.jpg :p
[00:57:47] <LordKalma> no such interesting places
[00:58:03] <patchvonbraun[m]> There's a heavy-duty crane on the cab deck that can be used for hauling stuff up and down.  Very civilized :)
[00:58:20] <LordKalma> that's to be expected in those places
[00:58:31] <patchvonbraun[m]> Your stuff is modern cool--the NATO site is retro-cool.
[00:58:43] <LordKalma> at my old uni the walls of the labs on the third floor were just aluminium panels that could be removed
[00:58:53] <LordKalma> and there was a sliding crane that could be used
[00:59:04] <patchvonbraun[m]> LordKalma: Iv'e always felt that houses should be build with panelized walls.
[00:59:19] <LordKalma> not good for privacy, but I get you
[01:01:07] <LordKalma> and also, good thing there was mostly desks and cabinets next to the wall
[01:01:14] <LordKalma> it wasn't confortable at all to lean on it
[01:01:44] <patchvonbraun[m]> The site owners are perfectly happy to give us anytime access, and the RFI tests I did today at 21cm were very encouraging.  They even sent me home with a coupla computers from their "bone yard" to see if I can get GR running on them so I can leave a monitoring application running for a week or two to check for spikes.  But 21cm looked pretty clean.
[01:03:10] <patchvonbraun[m]> I left our high-gain feedhorn there with cabling etc, so that when I get one of these "consed up" I can leave it there to see what the long-term RFI story is.  There's a general-aviation airport (ex military) a few km south of the site, and I'm worried about L-band radar, but apparently they just have VOR/TACAN.
[01:03:53] <LordKalma> GA airports aren't usually that well equipped 
[01:04:31] <patchvonbraun[m]> The guys who currently own the site ran a business for 30 years that installed and maintained radomes, so when this former-NATO site came up for government auction, they bought it and moved their headquarters into it.
[01:05:06] <LordKalma> those things are never sold here :(
[01:05:36] <LordKalma> the state radio and tv company has an old AM bc site

[01:13:45] <patchvonbraun[m]> NATO took all the "good stuff" with them, of course :)  None of the automated tracking computers, receivers, transmiters, etc, etc.  
[01:14:28] <patchvonbraun[m]> But the DID leave the feed in-place on the feed pedestal which makes life easier for us, because we know exactly where to place our own feed with respect to the focal distance of the hyperbolic sub-reflector.

[02:44:09] <patchvonbraun[m]> The DSN receivers are cryo-cooled
[02:44:38] <Macuser> ah, makes sense
[02:44:48] <Macuser> yeh he did mention specifically the space debris radar
[02:44:53] <Macuser> since they need super fine precision
[02:46:22] <patchvonbraun[m]> The DSN receivers are cooled because most of the objects they're communicating with are "way out there", and getting the aperture-gain/noise-figure product as optimized as possible is the name of the game.
[02:46:53] <muaddib[m]> I’m assuming that keeps things stable? What components are cryo-cooled? The whole receiver?
[02:49:40] <patchvonbraun[m]> muaddib: Just the LNAs typically, and often the feed-horns themselves are part of the cryo-envelope.  Keeps them stable, but also reduces the noise-figure of the LNAs, and the incidential radiation from feed components.
[02:55:09] <patchvonbraun[m]> Amateurs have often use things like peltier coolers on their LNAs, but that doesn't improve the noise-figure that much.  You really need stuff to be below about -80C or more before you notice any significant improvements in noise figure.
[02:55:26] <patchvonbraun[m]> So the "big boys" usually use either LN2 or LHe refrigeration loops.

[07:36:02] <muaddib[m]> It uses Synthesized Micro-Aperture connectors
[07:37:26] <patchvonbraun[m]> Way back in the 1950s, my father, an industrial metallurgist at the time, designed a process for continuous manufacture of flexible waveguide.  I found this out when I returned from a trip to Dayton in the late 1980s with a few pieces of X-band flexible waveguide.  "Oh, we used to make this stuff--I designed the process for producing it!".  I'm sure that my father went to his grave wiith lots of other interesting things that he never

[07:56:40] <aaknitt[m]> Wondering if anyone can help remove a brain block for me.  I've got to be fundamentally misunderstanding something.  See the flowgraph screenshot above.  I'm using frequency Xlating FIR filters to look at two different channels in the 162 MHz range.  One channel is a NOAA weather radio station at 162.400 and the other is nothing/noise at 162.855.  The waterfall displays confirm that.  Yet the data saved in two channels of the WAV file are
[07:56:40] <aaknitt[m]> identical...I would expect them to be different, since they're recording different channels (and should have different data coming in as confirmed by the waterfalls).  What am I missing?
[07:59:22] <drmpeg> Try more bits per sample on the WAV file.
[08:01:47] <aaknitt[m]> drmpeg: I just bumped it to 16, didn't seem to help
[08:03:26] <drmpeg> How are you checking that they're identical?
[08:03:38] <aaknitt[m]> If I feed a constant value into one of the two WAV channels, that channel is a constant value as I would expect, so the sink block seems to be doing what it should...just not sure how seemingly identical data is making it to both channels
[08:03:56] <aaknitt[m]> drmpeg: viewing them side by side in Audacity
[08:05:44] <drmpeg> You probably need to scale the values. Those multiply const blocks = 1 should probably be 32768.
[08:08:38] <aaknitt[m]> I don't think so.  The WAV sink appears to expect a float in the range of -1 to +1 for each channel.

[19:51:44] <Yamakaja[m]> So what kind of FM were you trying to demod? A digital signal, narrowband FM or broadcast (even stereo) FM?
[19:52:26] <LordKalma> I think it would be sensible to start with a simple nfm modem
[19:52:31] <LordKalma> but this is just an example

[19:54:43] <Yamakaja[m]> Now implement a GR embedded python block and see if it works ^^
[19:54:52] <LordKalma> hehehe :p 
[19:55:37] <LordKalma> I've wrapped couple SDRs APIs for a friend's project, I could make a small exe without much aditional trouble
[19:55:45] <Yamakaja[m]> Of course with a real system you'd do some extra filtering before taking diff(angle) or that is going to introduce some nasty noise ...

[22:23:52] <jogn_1[m]> Hey. I just wanted to ask for some advice here on alternatives to file sink. I did try giving file sink a try on a simple flowgraph, by printing out x values from the graph, but the problem was handling the data after it created a binary file (with blob data), I had to use an script to do some conversion and reading.
[22:23:52] <jogn_1[m]> I wanted to ask if there any solutions or ways of doing it on tree using GNU, something that makes it easier to for example extract some values and have it stored in a .txt file or something
[22:24:39] <jogn_1[m]> s/binary//, s/.//
[22:24:48] <funkylab[m]> how many values are we reading? 100? 10000? 10⁶?
[22:25:56] <funkylab[m]> because reading 100 values rather from a text file than converting them from a binary, I can see that. But already a text file with but 1000 lines of numbers is basically useless without a specific viewer for such data – in which case going the text file route is just not necessarily any easier!
[22:26:31] <funkylab[m]> But: I've always wondered what file types people actually *want* to use, so this is a great chance for me to get your feedback, jogn_1

[22:28:58] <jogn_1[m]> The size doesn't really matter that much, but it's the extra step of decoding the binary file (when using file sink) that I believe is unnecessary, therefore I was wondering if there are other alternatives, or if this is the best way?
[22:29:17] <jogn_1[m]> I'm just trying to see things from both perspectives = if you have more data or less data (like you have already answered)
[22:29:26] <jogn_1[m]> * data or even less data
[22:30:01] <patchvonbraun[m]> It's NOT just the data occupancy.  At high sample rates, the conversion into printable form consumes a surprising amount of CPU.  CPU that could be better spent doing "useful things" with samples.  
[22:31:23] <patchvonbraun[m]> if your terminal sample rate is not that high, you could do a very simple embedded-python block to log samples in any format that is convenient.  I do this with my radio astronomy applications, since the terminal sample rates are typically a few Hz at most.
[22:31:36] <jogn_1[m]> patchvonbraun[m]: Oh, yeah that makes sense. CPU processing would be a factor for something like that
[22:35:41] <funkylab[m]> yeah, what are you going to do with the samples after you've got them, is basically my question. Because, numbers-as-text is really not a "native" data format for basically any data processing entity, and as I tried to sketch up there, starting from not-that-many samples even for humans :)

[22:39:59] <jogn_1[m]> I just wanted to check if there were any alternatives. I know there's something called SigMF (but I have to look more into that)
[22:41:02] <jogn_1[m]> * into that. I haven't used it before.)
[22:41:31] <funkylab[m]> I think you'll find that if your use case isn't clear yet, then you'll have to convert sooner or later. Best store the samples as natively, performantly and as losslessly as possible – floating point numbers as text are none of that!
[22:44:25] <jogn_1[m]> funkylab[m]: I'll try to experiment with these stuff. I think this is probably my weakest, along with PMT/messages 😅 But yeah, I agree that a standard text file would be uninteresting for any case. 
[22:45:43] <jogn_1[m]> SigMF is on the other hand very cool. I haven't used it before, but saw a workshop vid
