[11:07:53] <theskillwithin> FunkyBob why nth-of-type instead of nth-child?  :nth-of-type(2n)
[11:08:02] <n0q> -nod- The selector really wasn't the issue so much as me not realizing why I couldn't do anything to these cells. Thanks for that. Of course, I'm still stuck with the issue of not being able to shade the entire row... just the cells. I was hoping that with a "row" div around the entire thing, I could nail it all in a single go.
[11:09:31] <theskillwithin> FunkyBob https://jsfiddle.net/theskillwithin/tqw8m6ys/
[11:11:13] <theskillwithin> n0q shade the entire row?  like this https://jsfiddle.net/theskillwithin/tqw8m6ys/2/  ?
[11:13:03] <n0q> Yeah. Removing the column-gap was the only way I could find.
[11:13:47] <n0q> I was thinking of trying to do some weird hacky thing with negative padding/margin/whatever, but that's just a shot in the dark.
[11:14:27] <theskillwithin> you could do that, or just remove gap

[11:57:38] <n0q> I have a habit of doing things the hard way as a learning experience. ;) Honestly, I'm new to css stuff, and I kept reading "Tables are dead! We can use grid and/or flux for everything now!" and I believed it.
[11:58:01] <n0q> *flex
[12:02:38] <FunkyBob> tables for layout are dead
[12:02:45] <FunkyBob> tables for tabular data are as valid as ever
[12:03:03] <FunkyBob> in the bad old days, we used highly nested tables to affect layouts because there wasn't much else
[12:03:09] <FunkyBob> but t hat was ~20 years ago
[12:03:19] <FunkyBob> now, with flex and grid... we don't need that
[12:03:33] <n0q> Yeah. I was reading stuff that broke everything down into tables, and had cells that were some fraction of the screen size.
[12:03:36] <FunkyBob> CSS and HTML now are vastly superior to then
[12:03:43] <FunkyBob> not to mention, so is cross-browser support
[12:03:44] <n0q> So your classes had to add up to 100%
[12:04:00] <FunkyBob> don't forget the transparent 1px gif
[12:05:57] <FunkyBob> we used to use flex, too, to get columns and so on
[12:06:09] <FunkyBob> because it was the best choice... despite all the drawbacks
[12:09:34] <n0q> I've quickly become fond of using flex inside of grid.
[12:10:47] <n0q> But yeah. I get what you're saying. I'll probably replace this thing with an actual, ohmygosh, table later. I'm writing a game system for a virtual tabletop. I'm going to need a LOT of tabular stuff. No reason to make it so painful on myself.
[12:27:02] <FunkyBob> use your HTML to clearly express the structure of your content
[12:27:13] <FunkyBob> it's a table? table. it's a header?  footer? section? list? article?
[12:27:16] <FunkyBob> we got 'em
[12:27:37] <FunkyBob> I find this a handy quick reference for all the html5 elements - http://html5doctor.com/
[12:27:50] <n0q> Honestly, now that I'm messing with tables for the first time (seriously. I was determined to not learn 'the old stuff' unless I had to)... hah. This is so ridiculously easy by comparison. :D
[12:27:57] <FunkyBob> and this a good way to choose a container element: http://html5doctor.com/downloads/h5d-sectioning-flowchart.png
[12:28:19] <FunkyBob> yeah, a lot of people misunderstand the 'don't use tables' thing
[12:28:29] <FunkyBob> it's more "don't _abuse_ tables"
[12:29:23] <n0q> To be fair, this got me WAY better with grid and flex than I would've been otherwise. But there's probably much more effective ways to skillup.

[14:24:05] <Duckling> for example doing a rainbow without needing 4 separate keyframes minimum
[14:24:29] <Duckling> because otherwise it "short circuits" kind of thing
[14:24:52] <Duckling> (quickest way from 0 to 360 (max) is 0-1
[14:26:11] <Duckling> something like a `direction: increment" or something
[14:26:51] <Duckling> I know in terms of other keyframe animations and the way they export, this could save a lot of unnecessary steps for otherwise linear movements
[14:27:11] <Duckling> or in this simple example, upto 8 extra keyframes

[21:50:55] <shantaram> https://i.imgur.com/sCjY3bM.png im trying to make an effect like this
[21:51:11] <shantaram> i feel like it's gonna be some combo of text shadow but i cant figure out what
[21:59:42] <nbjoerg> shantaram: https://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/text-shadow.en.html doesn't that cover it somewhat?
[21:59:52] <nbjoerg> specifically the drawing letter as outline section
[22:01:01] <hunboy> ugubok, https://jsfiddle.net/utasir/30ahsvz2/
[22:02:42] <shantaram> nbjoerg: perfect, thank you!
