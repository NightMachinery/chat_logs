[00:02:18] <hunboy> rickame, do you want this? : https://jsfiddle.net/4utmsjzo/
[00:03:02] <FunkyBob> why add a wrapper when you already have one, eh?
[00:05:27] <rickame> hunboy: hm ya! except it's weird to make the body sized less than viewport no?
[00:05:51] <FunkyBob> not really... there's the html element around that...
[00:06:13] <rickame> but that doesn't have bg color and other visual stuff that viewport still has
[00:07:13] <hunboy> and this? : https://jsfiddle.net/4utmsjzo/1/
[00:08:56] <hunboy> or this? : https://jsfiddle.net/4utmsjzo/2/
[00:10:21] <rickame> i wanted it centered with a limited width (min and max)
[00:10:39] <rickame> can it be done without max-width being on the body element?
[00:10:41] <hunboy> max-width is currently 1`24px
[00:10:46] <hunboy> max-width is currently 1024px
[00:10:49] <rickame> ya
[00:10:57] <hunboy> you can decrease that
[00:11:13] <hunboy> this is iPad width usually
[00:11:30] <hunboy> so i think ist handheld under 1`24px
[00:11:42] <hunboy> and desktop over that
[00:11:50] <rickame> just feels weird to set a bg color on body and have it apply to whole viewport, but then body has a max-width way narrower than that
[00:11:54] <rickame> feels illogical

[01:57:55] <rickame> i dont like the padding solution for centering tho

[03:17:06] <rickame> if you wanted to add a div to style a section, would you put the div before the section as the container or put the div in the section with section as wrapper?
[03:17:30] <rickame> i lean towards latter because div is related to section so seems good to embed in it but not sure
[03:19:58] <pavonia> I'd first make sure the div is actually needed
[03:20:25] <rickame> i want to make a background color then layer another background color that's semi transparent on top of it
[03:22:05] <pavonia> For the whole section?
[03:22:58] <rickame> ya
[03:23:55] <pavonia> Couldn't you just use the combined color as the section's background color then?
[03:24:25] <rickame> i want to use some tint color layers and swap out the background colors
[03:26:00] <rickame> and background attr can take multiple inputs but only the lowest bg can have color, the opposite of what i want
[03:26:19] <rickame> i might be able to make it work if i have to tho
[03:27:13] <pavonia> Okay, so if you want to target them via JS it's probably better to have an extra <div> (as opposed to CSS pseudo-elements), which should better go inside the <section>
[03:31:37] <rickame> no only 1 color can be in there so multiple bg on 1 element isnt gonna work
[03:32:06] <rickame> ok so the section becomes the container for the div and its contents
[03:32:34] <rickame> if i don't care to target them with js, is the css pseudo element solution better?
[03:32:51] <rickame> how do you even do it?
[03:33:58] <pavonia> Having less elements that are only there for styling purposes are usually preferred
[03:40:11] <rickame> is the pseudo element trick better than using linear-gradient trick?
[03:40:17] <rickame> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28592053/multiple-background-color-layers
[03:44:17] <pavonia> I would avoid both if you want to change the color
[03:45:47] <rickame> i set a background on the section to linear-gradient(mycolor, mycolor) white; so it makes the solid white bg then paints the transparent mycolor over it, works!!

[05:49:39] <rickame> souldessin: well spec seems to say user agents should default to light, but im getting dark as default. i searched firefox about:config and found a possible source
[05:50:02] <rickame> widget.content.alt-theme.dark is true
[05:50:13] <souldessin> Yeah, my personal about:config is the same.
[05:50:31] <rickame> is dark mode default for you too? or light

[11:55:16] <FunkyBob> does the img element have class="main"?
[11:55:23] <FunkyBob> or is it inside an element with class="main"?
[11:55:31] <magga> its inside the div with class "main2
[11:55:51] <FunkyBob> img.main means an <img> with 'main' in its class list
[11:55:57] <FunkyBob> not on its parents... on it directly
[11:56:00] <magga> oh ok :)
[11:56:16] <magga> so if i wanna select all img childrens of class main you have to write: main img {}
[11:56:18] <magga> .main *
[11:56:22] <FunkyBob> yes
[11:56:30] <magga> FunkyBob: alright thanks for the quick answer
[11:56:32] <FunkyBob> well, that will be any descendant, not just direct children
[11:56:38] <magga> https://ibb.co/1mXJ19Q
[11:56:40] <FunkyBob> .main > img  would by immediate children
[11:56:54] <magga> you see that arrow on the right side there. would you create than in pure css or just export the vector (.svg)
[11:57:21] <FunkyBob> could do it in css easily enough
[11:57:59] <FunkyBob> easy enough in a ::after
[11:58:26] <magga> that would be ::after the "Celine Dion" h3 right?
[11:58:39] <FunkyBob> no idea... did you share your markup anywhere?
[11:58:50] <FunkyBob> it's hard to comment on HTML I can't see
[12:00:33] <magga> im gonna figure it out:) i'll let you know if i run into any problems. but would you say its bad practise to use the .svg's for simple graphics like that?

[12:05:31] <FunkyBob> not sure how you read "that tone" into what I wrote
[12:05:32] <scream> i asked you a question and you decided that it was better to make me look like you couldn't POSSIBLY understand what i meant to ask.
[12:05:40] <scream> there is a tone to how everyone writes. you agree, right?
[12:06:17] <FunkyBob> sure, but it's also possible to infer a tone that's not there
[12:06:38] <scream> encoding a pause after an interjection like you did is stilted and implies withholding of personal information. your entire message is completely dismissive and just shouts "i'm better than you, but i'm not going to elaborate."

[12:07:39] <scream> WE ALL AGREE THAT ME PUTTING THIS TEXT ON YOUR SCREEN IS ANNOYING. CAN'T YOU AGREE THAT YOU MIGHT BE PUTTING THE WRONG IDEA OUT THERE, AND IT'S NOT MY DUTY TO INFER BEST INTENTIONS AND LET YOU KEEP SOUNDING LIKE A PRICK?
[12:08:35] <FunkyBob> certainly, I can believe some people may misconstrue my  intent.
[12:08:55] <FunkyBob> but it is a good practice to assume best intentions in a help channel, generally.
[12:08:56] <scream> and now you need to go to the next step, which is to stop acting like a prick and thinking you don't need to change.
[12:09:18] <FunkyBob> you're the only person here who's said they think i'm acting like a prick.
[12:09:30] <scream> stop defending yourself with vague aphorisms and just change your tone. look into yourself for ten seconds and realize the point of this channel is to help, not to help however you see fit.
[12:09:44] <scream> yes, it turns out that i'm the only one willing to risk my membership of the channel to tell you the truth.
[12:10:11] <scream> you think i'm doing this because it feels good, which is fucking stupid. it's already gone on for an ENTIRE FUCKING SCREEN and i'm sick of talking about it because you're clearly too far up your own goddamned ass to take the hint.
[12:10:33] <FunkyBob> no, I think you're doing this because you read something into my words, and felt it needed calling out.
[12:10:46] <scream> i "read something into it" that was there
[12:10:49] <FunkyBob> which is fair enough.
[12:10:55] <scream> nothing that you've said since has diverged from the tone i talked abuot
[12:11:05] <scream> even what you're doing now makes you look like some sophist prick
[12:11:17] <scream> "which is fair enough." that's not even a fucking sentence, and yet you made it its own line
[12:11:23] <magga> sorry if i started any conflict guys. i just want peace :o
[12:11:25] <scream> you are DRAGGING EVERYTHING OUT and ADDING NOTHING all at the same time
[12:11:28] <FunkyBob> magga: you didn't.
[12:11:37] <scream> magga: so do i, so i find it important to tell people when they're being pricks and utterly unhelpful
[12:11:54] <scream> what he SHOULD have said was "here is my personal opinion about the practice, what my lines are for that, and why you should care about my personal opinion."
[12:12:09] <scream> instead, he said "HAHA. I HAVE AN OPINION. YOU WANT IT? DO YOU IMPLICITLY WANT THIS OPINION? I HAVE IT."
[12:12:13] <scream> utter fucking sophistry
[12:12:54] <scream> if i could detonate someone's computer remotely i'd be in prison after they pieced funkybob's mother's basement back together
[12:13:10] <scream> libera is just so fucking useless now because of this insufferable fucks
[12:13:14] <magga> looks like you guys have som history
[12:13:18] <scream> incorrect
[12:13:20] <FunkyBob> magga: nope
[12:13:25] <scream> i have a history of this entire network being a twitter clone
[12:13:33] <scream> and we all share that dumb shit
[12:13:56] <scream> but do we have exclamation points to remind people to stop being pricks, or to remind them that their personal opinion doesn't fucking matter unless they back that shit up?
[12:13:57] <scream> no.
[12:14:10] <scream> we don't have a fucking single thing that corrects these behaviors at the same level that we try to pretend we can control the behaviors of the people asking

[12:14:27] <scream> it's like going to a high school where they beat kids for talking back after asking them fucking questions
[12:16:46] <magga> scream: there is plenty of helpful people in this network. you just need to prepare everything for your question. and by everything i mean pastebins and error messages. i find it hard with css tho, since the project im working on has so many files and rules that its hard to just recreate it in a codepen or similar
[12:17:09] <magga> and the fact that im a beginner in css aswell
[12:18:33] <hmw[at]> reducing a problematic page to the minimum code needed to show the error often shows you how to solve it
[12:18:39] <scream> magga: that's putting too much on the asker
[12:18:55] <scream> that's the real problem, too, hmw[at]
[12:19:03] <scream> doing what we tell people on libera to do will just SOLVE THE PROBLEM

[12:19:16] <scream> and there are so few chatters here that half the channels are fucking dead anyway
[12:19:23] <scream> we lost pedagogical power
[12:19:34] <scream> so we must make what little we have left more efficient at keeping and growing it
[12:19:36] <magga> yeah i totally agree. anyways, my original question was about if its bad practise to use .svgs for small graphics like that "right arrow" or should i just create it in css :)
[12:19:40] <hmw[at]> http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html -- http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:19:44] <scream> but no one will, because everyone will just whine to mods when i tell them to change their tone
[12:20:02] <scream> those questions on "smart questions" just make it so you're asking questions that you can answer yourself and reduces question load
[12:20:09] <scream> doesn't give you the real chance to do the right thing
[12:20:11] <scream> for example
[12:20:15] <hmw[at]> magga: I pesonally prefer CSS if it is something simple, makes it readable to people who don't know svg.
[12:20:22] <FunkyBob> magga: for that specific case, you could easily use > if it looks right, and so avoid the extra overhead (1 char versus many)
[12:20:32] <scream> XY problem questions aren't a problem from the questioner's mind, it's that the answerer is stupidly wanting a "one answer one question" relationship, which is dumb
[12:20:43] <FunkyBob> magga: but for other shapes, or multiple shapes... svg can be a more flexible choice
[12:20:58] <magga> the designer im creating this for is super pricky and she would nag me if it isnt an exact copy
[12:21:25] <FunkyBob> magga: in that case, sounds like an image is a better path... svg it is.
[12:21:30] <FunkyBob> hence: it depends
[12:21:36] <scream> magga: my threshold is one of comfort for integrating it into the code, and it varies so much for the site at the time, but if you're going to build things that you're going to use later and steal from in future projects, you have to make it the most "robust"

[12:26:32] <magga> okay :)
[12:29:19] <magga> anyone got a nice cheatsheet for flexbox?
[12:31:24] <hmw[at]> https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/
[12:31:37] <hmw[at]> also, reading up everything on MDN will help
[12:32:19] <hmw[at]> and a little practice perhaps. Make yourself a cheat sheet, collection of example files
[12:32:23] <magga> perfect. the poster what was what i was looking for
[12:33:08] <magga> ive practised in smaller projects. i just wanted to have a cheatsheet on the wall next to my screens here :)
[12:33:36] <hmw[at]> My wall isn't big enough for all the cheat sheets I'd like to have :)
[12:33:55] <magga> :D
[12:38:54] <scream> magga: grid and flexbox are both good stuff to keep in mind
[12:51:46] <magga> scream: yeah im starting with flex here in this project. im probably gonna try out grid on the next one
[12:52:32] <undefined_bob> grid is kinda complicated in my opinion. But its nice once you figured it out
[12:53:12] <scream> yeah, i wonder how it got there, undefined_bob, as it seems to hope to simplify that kind of stuff
[12:53:20] <scream> it's all about the pedagogy, and there are some fun ones out there
[12:53:23] <scream> some video series, as well
[12:53:28] <scream> grid from that one girl at mozilla is great
[12:53:32] <scream> i'll put it up in a minute
