[00:00:44] <sney> Ondrej Sury has been the maintainer for php packages in debian for 10? years at this point, so there's no magic mojo in his separate repo.
[00:00:53] <sney> but if you need the different versions it's fine to use.

[00:40:44] <Razva> for a system where disk expansion/repartitioning is not required, would you recommend ZFS or BTRFS?

[00:51:21] <luca>  o/
[00:51:35] <Razva> I'm basically interested in speed
[00:51:47] <Razva> only two disks, software RAID1
[00:52:05] <quadrat> choose whichever you feel more comfortable with
[00:52:19] <quadrat> they are both very viable
[00:52:33] <Razva> well ... I don't know which one is faster and the interwebz have different results
[00:53:11] <sney> zfs is handy on a hypervisor because you can use a zvol for the vm disk, rather than a qcow2 file or whatever
[00:53:41] <Razva> yeah, 'till now I've used zfs
[00:54:08] <Razva> but I noticed that Proxmox is adding btrfs so I was wondering if I should stick with zfs or try btrfs

[07:53:43] <edufmass> Hello, I don't have sudo installed. I need to "su -" to be able to scan for wifi and connect. Is there a way to allow my user to use iwlist, iwconfig, etc. to connect to wifi?
[07:54:01] <sney> sure, they're just in /sbin
[07:54:13] <sney> your user can call /sbin/iwlist directly, or you can add /sbin to your PATH 
[07:55:22] <edufmass> easier than I thought, I was thinking in permissions or another kind of solution 
[07:55:23] *** Quits: kedar_apte (~kedar@27.58.243.153) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[07:55:26] <edufmass> thank you sney !
[07:56:20] <sney> for actually configuring the wifi you will still need root permissions, but for just looking at the available APs and stuff any user can use those tools 
[07:57:05] <sney> you may want to try ifupdown, it's smoother than connecting everything manually. https://wiki.debian.org/WiFi/HowToUse#Using_ifupdown
[07:59:52] <edufmass> If I still need root I think I'll end installing network-manager

[12:50:54] <jelly> ratrace, that's... not what I call cross-compilation :-)
[12:51:12] <PMT> I mean, there's "qemu-user to run the native target binaries", and there's "native host binaries to build the target", usually I expect the latter to be called cross-compilation.
[12:51:29] <ratrace> but there's really no other way if you go across arches. you've got unit tests during compilation, and other things that often have to exec on that arch, during compilation.
[12:51:57] <ratrace> I mean, sure, for some cases where this is not happening, you can coerce the toolchain to produce alien opcodes, as long as none are attempted to be executed.
[12:53:49] <ratrace> (hell, it's as bad as tryna build for march=skylake on a haswell so your FreeBSD Poudriere server melts down and refuses to cooperate so you yank it out of the rack with a crowbar but I digress now)

[13:04:20] <ratrace> PMT: there's a second, extremely important part for that statement, based on actual experience, with packages that often during compilation have phases that have to execute on native arch
[13:04:41] <ratrace> I also said that without that requirement, sure, the toolchain can produce opcodes for any arch.
[13:05:06] <ratrace> And then you ignored all that, focused on the first part and made a non-funny. Shame on youse. Bad dog! No!
[13:06:21] <jelly> curse you test-driven development
[13:06:49] <PMT> I interpreted that as "[the compilers] require native execution" not "arbitrary compiled programs", and I can only recall one time a program required running the test suite as part of the build process.
[13:07:23] <PMT> (In my personal experiences, obviously.)
[13:07:36] <jelly> if there's a test suite in deb-src, it's run and has to pass
[13:08:28] <PMT> Sure, but when I've been cross-compiling, it wasn't Debian packages, and that's not a requirement of the software being built.
[13:08:33] <ratrace> not just test suites. take python package for example. they all, by default, produce bytecode for which you need python exec'd on that arch
[13:08:38] <ratrace> packages*
[13:09:12] <ratrace> (as in the packaging is set to pre-"compile" .pyc and __pycache__)

[20:02:04] <ede> moving over a fs from to a partition of the same size is as simple as cp/dd?
[20:02:14] *** Joins: Raito_Bezarius (~Raito@wireguard/tunneler/raito-bezarius)
[20:02:32] <greycat> I'd use rsync, personally.  cp -a might also be good enough.
[20:03:09] <greycat> Things to watch out for: sparse files, ACLs, or other non-traditional super metadata.
[20:03:16] *** Joins: towo_home (~towo@ip1f10ac38.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de)
[20:03:28] <ede> i was thinking more of moving the whole partition en block, not the individual files.
[20:03:46] <greycat> Usually the two partitions are not *exactly* the same size.
[20:04:25] <ede> the HDD seems to give up now, and it's always the same partition, everything else always was fine with badblocks. and i'd like to prepare the system for the next big reboot finally.
[20:04:36] <PMT> I'd personally use ddrescue just for the resume feature when you use a logfile, if it were of any significant size and I really wanted to do that, but dd would do. Obviously make absolutely sure nothing manipulates the partition contents while doing this, etc etc.
[20:04:40] <ede> oh, that's what i paid attention to :)
[20:04:42] <greycat> Copying at the device level also doesn't give you a free defrag, and doesn't let you create the new file system with different parameters, new version of the file system tools, etc.
[20:05:23] <ede> no issues, it just has to do its job for a very limited timespan
[20:06:02] <ede> PMT: ah thanks for the hint, didn't think of this one.
[20:06:37] <PMT> I also would encourage ddrescue when you're recovering from misbehaving disks. :)
[20:06:40] <ede> the first thing i'd do after it would be fsck and some comparison anyway
[20:07:04] <PMT> But like I said, you'd want to use the optional logfile argument if you want it to be able to resume if, say, the disk falls off the bus and you need to stop and start. :)
[20:07:16] <ede> iirc it was of help already some years ago
[20:07:41] <ede> heh, badblocks finished after just 10 minutes :D
[20:08:00] <ede> the last time a ran it it took 7 hours, but that was on a 4TB then
[20:08:10] <PMT> (It also has functionality to skip a while past areas that are bad and continue, then if you wish, go back after it finishes and try to narrow down exactly how small the unreadable areas are, and also if you wish, keep trying on them until they read or the counter is reached or the sun burns out.)
[20:08:53] <greycat> Ah, I missed the context that you were dealing with failing hardware.  That completely changes the question.
[20:08:54] <ede> sounds like cdparanoia, or was it exact audio copy? ;)

[21:53:03] <Kvothe> Hi, a local company is claiming they developed a thin client and selling/renting it. IT's basically a stripped(no logo, no access to documentation, files) version of raspbian inside a rapsberry pi with a proprietary case. It just starts a rdp session on startup.
[21:53:10] <Kvothe> I was wondering if such things were legal
[21:53:31] <Kvothe> to put your own logo on top of both: raspbian and raspberry
[21:53:50] <greycat> #raspbian might have an opinion
[21:54:31] <Kvothe> it's more akin to linux lore tho is there such open source licenses channels?
[21:54:33] <Kvothe> lol
[21:54:47] <ede> PMT: the question is if it makes any sense. seems i have fs problems only in the doc section, or at least most of them...
[21:54:47] <greycat> as far as legality goes, nobody here is a lawyer (afaik), but they only need to comply with the licenses of the software they're distributing -- in most cases, BSD and GPL licenses, so they would need to offer source code for the GPL pieces

[22:35:10] <sney> and someone has already filed a bug, #989931 
[22:35:11] <judd> Bug https://bugs.debian.org/989931 in zeal (open): «Package zeal is missing in debian 11 "Bullseye"»; severity: normal; opened: 2021-06-16; last modified: 2021-06-16.
[22:35:31] <hassoon> :|
[22:35:32] <sney> you may want to reply to this bug, as that would probably alert the maintainer (again) 
[22:35:48] <sney> package maintainers are volunteers and sometimes they need a reminder.

[22:39:05] <Mathisen> the release is soon anyway. so i thought i just get it done
[22:39:18] <hassoon> Mathisen: ya i use it in my laptop, pretty good s ofar
[22:39:32] <hassoon> * so far

[22:39:56] <hassoon> a vps would be the same imo
[22:40:54] <Mathisen> yeah my main usage is sql,php,smb
[22:41:22] <greycat> At this point in a release cycle, the software is good enough for most uses, and the major issue is that there is no security coverage yet.  So don't put it on a publicly exposed server.

[22:41:40] <Mathisen> well then i wait then
[22:42:18] <Mathisen> thanks greycat

[22:59:16] <ede> somehow i was distracted... ddrescue did a fine job, -r just takes seconds, i'd been afraid it would just restart everything, but it just parses the mapfile.
[23:00:00] <PMT> it can take a long time if it's retrying many times or the drive takes a long time to respond when it errors or or or. but I'm glad it didn't.
[23:00:11] <ede> so now time for step 2. the thing is, it is the *drumroll* root partition (with /boot on its own). so i think i'd have to change just the UUID in fstab and i'm done?
[23:00:32] <PMT> why would you change the UUID?
[23:01:05] <ede> i didn't check the complete info file, but this:
[23:01:08] <ede> #      pos        size  status
[23:01:08] <ede> 0x00000000  0x380000000  +
[23:01:18] <ede> looks like "everything's fine from start to end"
[23:01:29] <PMT> well, everything was read, at least.

[23:01:49] <ede> had a dozen lines after the initial run, some + some - and others /
[23:03:16] <ede> but yeah, after the issues i had with the CPU on wheezy and forced reboots with follow-up fsck with a partition not having a journal (i think the initial idea was to see the difference, seems it's mostly that fsck takes forever)
[23:04:02] <ede> @ UUID: have fstab point to the other partition with the (hopefully) sane fs now
