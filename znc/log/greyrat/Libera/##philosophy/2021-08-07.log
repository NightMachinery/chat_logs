[12:08:55] <krb> hate is a great motivator
[12:09:11] <brigand> love is a great motivator

[12:11:05] <brigand> i could tell you but it's none of your business
[12:11:21] <plankers> then you dont have much of an argument
[12:11:34] <krb> love makes people weak
[12:11:51] <plankers> more accurately, it makes them want to compromise
[12:12:07] <plankers> which can be useful, if the people youre compromising with arent fucking insane

[12:12:14] <spruit11> I am with brigand

[12:13:02] <plankers> mine didnt

[12:15:45] <plankers> i have plenty of fun. being angry isnt fun
[12:15:46] <krb> i'd end up with no one then

[12:18:00] <plankers> no i know what youre trying to say. ive had such relationships
[12:18:05] <plankers> and i dont want to have such relationships
[12:18:33] <brigand> it's ok to be weak, it's ok to compromise. that's how humanity got this far
[12:18:46] <krb> having wealth and power certainly helps in such regard, so it becomes easier
[12:18:58] <plankers> its not, though. its a combination of people compromising and refusing to compromise that has gotten us to this point
[12:19:18] <plankers> for example, cuba. the sterling example of a people who refuse to compromise with the global order
[12:19:27] <plankers> and its worked out quite well for them, all things considered
[12:20:00] <krb> wouldn't want to loose those cuban cigars
[12:20:07] <plankers> so good
[12:22:01] <brigand> relationship is compromise too. you can compromise to hate each other. that's fine if it works

[14:43:59] <arcturus> it depends on the person
[14:44:44] <plankers> hate takes its own toll tho
[14:44:49] <krb> true hate is good, and it takes a master to do it
[14:45:25] <Ungwelian> Hate is an important emotion.
[14:45:51] <krb> loving is easy, like rainbows and cuddle

[14:47:18] <krb> and people become depressed or suicidal
[14:47:42] <krb> love makes people weak, but hate makes people strong
[14:47:57] <plankers> well theres more to it than that
[14:47:58] <krb> you can control people with hate
[14:48:04] <plankers> thats a certain mode of expression, sure
[14:48:05] <krb> love makes one loose control
[14:48:37] <plankers> perhaps a good way to think of it is that hate is the gas while love is the steering wheel
[14:49:03] <plankers> another mode of expression
[14:49:04] <krb> doesn't sound right to me
[14:49:49] <plankers> i mean in the sense that you use your hatred of your enemies to fuel you while you use your love of humanity to guide you
[14:50:21] <plankers> or maybe its the other way around
