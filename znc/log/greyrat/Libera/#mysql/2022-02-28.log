[03:49:07] <CyberCr33p> Is it possible to change the max_execution_time in my.cnf like this? https://dpaste.com/ED74TVALM.txt
[03:50:58] <CyberCr33p> I want to have different max_execution_time for [mysql] and for [mysqldump]
[04:57:43] <thumbs> CyberCr33p: did you try it?
[05:16:04] <thumbs> CyberCr33p: you can set very low values to see if it is effective.
