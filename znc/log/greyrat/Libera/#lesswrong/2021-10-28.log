[01:27:57] <dTal> CoJaBo_: In some countries, it's common for shopping trollies ("carts" to Yanks) to require a deposit. Putting a coin into a slot in a little box on the handle, unlocks it from the stack. Returning your trolley returns your coin.
[01:28:02] <pompolic> well, if you permanently set aside a pound coin for this purpose, that's like spending a pound

[01:31:46] <dTal> I recall having an argument with someone over their purchase of such a token, a great many years ago. They had indeed spent at least £1, if not more. Their logic? "I'll never spend it."
[01:31:59] <dTal> "So I'll always have it."

[01:36:15] <vrs> keeping a coin around is a conscious act, having a token you can't spend because it doesn't even look like money is not
[01:36:47] <vrs> removing small frictions from everyday life adds up
[01:38:08] <gwern> (or you could just use ound coins like normal, and should you somehow run out and not have one, take a minute and go inside and exchange)
[01:38:26] <saturn2> if you're spending your last £1 you wouldn't be able to afford enough to need a trolley anyway
[01:39:50] <vrs> if I'm spending my last €1 that merely means I'll have to fall back to my EC card, which I don't like to use as much as cash
[01:40:31] <vrs> or, if I've spent my last €1 in the bakery and realize that I now need a trolley
[01:41:00] <vrs> gwern that's much higher overhead?
[01:41:06] <gwern> no, it's lower
[01:41:20] <gwern> unless you are exceedingly careless and running out of coins is something you're doing quite a lot?
[01:41:42] <dTal> saturn2 raises an excellent point, you are permanently removing the ability to spend the pound but that's not likely to constrain your future actions much
[01:41:48] <gwern> (ie. going in once every decade or three, vs carrying around a useless coin everywhere you go for the rest of your life)
[01:41:58] <vrs> the cost of that one coin is several minutes and interacting with people off-script
[01:41:59] *** CoJaBo_ is now known as CoJaBo
[01:42:17] <saturn2> i still think the keychain explanation makes more sense
[01:42:27] <vrs> if I have to do that even once, I'd rather have bought the token in retrospect
[01:42:48] <gwern> it is not 'several minutes'. it's like a minute to walk in, hand the cashier a bill, and get coins. any place which does the coin thing, the employees know. I had to do it 5 years ago the first time I visited my local aldi, went to the carts and went 'what the fuck' and went in for quarters
[01:42:55] <gwern> the cashier didn't blink an eye
[01:43:02] <vrs> do you know the cashier queues around here?
[01:43:15] <dTal> It does, saturn2, and I'm a bit annoyed there's a rational and practical explanation instead of the philosophical conundrum I thought :p
[01:43:17] <gwern> I didn't queue. I just went up and handed them a buck and they did it then and there
[01:43:19] <vrs> it's not soviet tier but you will be standing there for a minute at least
[01:43:36] <vrs> ah we don't have paper bucks here, they start at 5€
[01:44:16] <gwern> a customer standing there with 50 items on the belt isn't going to complain when they see someone handing a $1 bill over for quarters and heading right back out. they might've done the same thing themselves, and even if they didn't understand, you'd have to be an ultra-asshole to complain about waiting another 10 or 20 seconds and insisting that person wait like 10 minutes behind you
[01:44:21] <dTal> gwern: the only shops round here that used locked trolleys are places like Aldi and Lidl, and they're not structured for easy access to clerks
[01:45:04] <gwern> (anyway, I actually handed them $5 because I reasoned that with no quarters in my wallet or my car, that also meant I couldn't use any payphones or vending machines, and I should keep more quarters in my car anyway)
[01:45:06] <vrs> also it's rude to skip line for whatever reason
[01:45:15] <dTal> I don't even think the entrances allow access to the "exit area"
[01:45:32] <gwern> you just walk in through the exit. people are always going out

[01:45:41] <vrs> muh ordnung
[01:45:44] <dTal> Aldi is structured like border patrol
[01:46:23] <gwern> vrs: I just explained why this is one of the common situations where it is 100% socially acceptable to skip ahead: when you have a task which is extremely trivial and orders of magnitude shorter than a standard interaction

[01:47:42] <dTal> gwern: interrupting an Aldi cashier is like interrupting an assembly line worker
[01:48:04] <gwern> dTal: the speed means that they reach an idle state all that faster, and can handle your queued interrupt :)
[01:48:56] <vrs> a good queue is never empty
[01:49:00] <dTal> If only! It just means they keep up with the fabulously huge trolleyfulls people always get at Aldi because everything's cheap
[01:49:21] <dTal> "Idle state" isn't a thing

[01:51:45] <dTal> In any case. Clearly there's value in avoiding that sort of hassle. That's not the issue. The issue is whether it's rational to exchange money for constraining your future self from spending a coin.

[01:55:14] <kuudes> yes, 5e is smallest and rare
[01:55:20] <gwern> kuudes: because large numerical values of bills fit nicely in my wallet while any appreciable amount of coins takes a lot more space & weight and I typically have no use for coins
[01:55:35] <kuudes> I have coins for tokens and pay everything with card

[01:56:00] <kuudes> wow
[01:56:13] <gwern> something which I *need* and which also *requires* coins is... pretty rare. Aldi is literally my only usecase these days for coins

[08:09:03] <saturn2> progress? i don't believe it exists
[08:09:05] <quanticle> Yes, those are circles, but most *other* buttons are squircles
[08:09:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also I would be somewhat surprised if Google actually used real squircles instead of faking it with roundrects
[08:09:52] <adiabatic> apple probably has a patent on real squircles anyway

[08:13:38] <quanticle> Yeah, in 12 that's gone
[08:13:58] <quanticle> You have to swipe down to the notifications panel, and then swipe down again to get to the quick action buttons

It is the number of times that money moves from one entity to another. It also refers to how much a unit of currency is used in a given period of time. Simply put, it's the rate at which consumers and businesses in an economy collectively spend money.

[19:05:23] <ggreer> > Enter Starship. Annual capacity to LEO climbs from its current average of 500 T for the whole of our civilization to perhaps 500 T per week. Eventually, it could exceed 1,000,000 T/year. At the same time, launch costs drop as low as $50/kg, roughly 100x lower than the present. For the same budget in launch, supply will have increased by roughly 100x. How can the space industry saturate this increased launch supply?

[20:44:46] <galambo> kuudes, the outcomes of ecmo are discussed under 'complications of ecmo'. just be mindful that people who have ecmo tend to be much healthier than the average patient. also surviving an itu admission does not necessarily mean that they will be ok in the long term
[20:44:47] <kuudes> galambo, but yeah, I would like as many vaccines as possible, as every time I read this sort of thing, it becomes apparent that it is of high probability that I would get triaged for murder

[20:46:07] <kuudes> I would absolutely choose being full paralyzed as long as I get comfortable life if the alternative was death
[20:46:16] <galambo> yes but then ecmo requires a huge amount of resources. if the resources are available then fair enough. I hope with covid settling down that we use this therapies more

[20:48:02] <kuudes> galambo, the case in usa where a 16 year old got into ecmo and recovered but was ruled out of lung transplant while awake, it was iirc about 20000$ for the machine, but >100k$ for operation
[20:48:27] <kuudes> but it seemed to me if his mom could have been trained for cleaning the machine, a new car worth of money would have bought his life
[20:48:44] <galambo> kuudes, maybe in an alternate univserse where authorities have a can do approach to life this may have happened. but I dont think it would be feasible if the hospitals are overwhelmed
[20:48:47] <kuudes> he was fully conscious, did his high school homework in hospital
[20:49:05] <kuudes> spoke with people, was a full 16 year old person sitting in a bed
[20:49:24] <kuudes> but because of money, they stopped cleaning his ecmo so that he died to the uncleanliness of ecmo slowly
[20:49:38] <kuudes> because the alternative was that he would have lived tens of years in an ecmo
[20:49:44] <kuudes> so...

[20:50:09] <kuudes> yes. but currently we don't have hospitals overwhelmed and never are allowed to allow them to get overwhelmed
[20:50:22] <kuudes> we know we must lock down if they are in danger of getting overwhelmed
[20:50:39] <kuudes> because otherwise we are doing a mass murder
[20:51:03] <kuudes> but I certainly can take a loan for 50ke if it was my life
[20:51:06] <kuudes> I have disabl
[20:51:13] <kuudes> disability insurance for larger than that
[20:51:16] <kuudes> some 400ke payout
[20:51:28] <kuudes> for death I have insured myself only for 100ke
[20:51:46] <kuudes> but they are in different companies, so hopefully they can't cooperate to murder me to get off cheaper
[20:52:10] <kuudes> but yes, 400ke should buy me a personal ecmo. but I presume they won't sell such, even though market price is less.
[20:52:31] <kuudes> or how do you see it galambo?
[20:52:52] <kuudes> btw why are we not thirddosing obese people already...
[20:55:25] <kuudes> galambo, are they thirddosing people in uk?
[20:55:27] <galambo> kuudes, I think you overestimate the usefulness of ecmo. not that many people with covid would benefit from itu. and even a smaller number would benefit from ecmo. and I mean benefit in the sense of having lots of invasive and undignified interventions for a negligible risk of survival.
[20:55:45] <galambo> not just funding
[20:55:54] <kuudes> over here only 1/5 of icu covid patients die iirc?
[20:56:32] <galambo> kuudes, if they let more people into itu the mortality will increase. and the survivors tend to be in bad shape after itu
[20:56:38] <kuudes> I mean, that is why the unvaccinated are a problem, per death there are 5 rounds of icu, about 2 weeks each
[20:56:41] <kuudes> yes
[20:56:50] <kuudes> if we allow overcrowding, deaths will 5x for covid
[20:56:56] <galambo> like I said earlier. half working age people who go to itu return to work within a year
[20:57:02] <kuudes> and 10x for noncovid, as covid takes twice the time normal patients

[22:15:24] <gwern> 'In November 2019, Hsieh’s family said he began to experiment with ketamine, which in high doses can lead to hallucinations, they said. Soon after, Hsieh began to misuse ketamine, causing “Tony to suffer from disorganized delusions and delusions of grandeur,” they write in court documents. One example the family gives is Hsieh’s belief that all humans were living in a simulation...
[22:15:30] <gwern> ...called the “simulation hypothesis.” “Tony believed that he was able to learn special skills while under the influence of ketamine that would allow him to defeat the [simulation hypothesis] to save humanity,” court documents said...In February 2020, Hsieh’s friends convinced him to attend a rehab facility. While at the facility, a friend made a list of “behaviors Tony had...
[22:15:36] <gwern> ...exhibited that caused people to believe Tony needed an intervention.” The list included the power to transform into animals or other objects, the ability to “download talents to his brain with minimal study” and the ability to manifest water, court documents said. Hsieh left rehab and continued “abusing Ketamine to excess,” the documents said...In June 2020, longtime friends...
[22:15:42] <gwern> ...planned a trip for Hsieh in Montana. According to court documents, Hsieh “boarded the bus wearing only pajama pants… and brought only a box of crayons with him.” He also offered a friend $1 million to serve as his personal alarm clock. While on the bus to Montana, Hsieh also asked his friends to join a suicide pact. When Hsieh arrived back home to Utah, he exhibited signs of...
[22:15:48] <gwern> ...psychosis and was taken to a hospital.' https://www.8newsnow.com/i-team/i-team-tony-hsiehs-final-months-described-as-drug-addicted-psychosis-as-family-fights-off-lawsuits-staking-claim-to-estate-zappos-las-vegas-nevada/ huh. so it was ketamine which kicked it off, and the nitrous oxide was just what he had moved onto when it got fatal
[22:15:48] <Robomot> I-Team: Tony Hsieh’s final months described as drug-addicted ‘psychosis,’ family fights claims to estate | KLAS (The family of late Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh claims some people in his inner circle allowed the former Las Vegas entrepreneur to enter into contracts even as his health deteriorated due to longtime substance misuse, court records said.)
[22:16:20] <two2thehead> Pajamas on a plane. A sign of a most deranged mind
[22:16:32] <gwern> (also, this probably explains those reports a while ago about 'silicon valley billionaires funding research on how to escape the simulation'. hsieh was probably one of them, given how much money he was throwing around on random shit... although the timing of late 2019 might be wrong. I recall those reports from quite a while ago, years and years ago)
[22:17:16] <rmmh> hallucinogens are totally safe and fine apart from those permanent psychotic shifting effects
[22:18:01] <gwern> hsieh had problems all along. people at zappos talked about the disturbing amount of alcohol he used
[22:18:08] <gwern> at work, even
[22:18:39] <gwern> it's pretty obvious that if you are already diagnosable, psychedelics are probably extremely bad for you as an accelerant
[22:18:49] <rmmh> yes
[22:18:50] <two2thehead> hm
[22:18:54] <two2thehead> that was my next question
[22:19:11] <gwern> 'In another claim, Hsieh’s family said Pham was paid $30,000 each day another contactor with whom she had “developed a feud” was at one of Hsieh’s properties. documents said. An invoice for the fee totaled more than $1.8 million.' <-- she had to be paid for her emotional labor
[22:19:14] <two2thehead> "What if any predictors are their for psychotic breaks, from using drugs"
[22:19:25] <rmmh> even on the simplest model of psychedics nudging your mind into 'more open' states with some permanent effects, if you're already *really open* and a *little crazy*, nudging further is a bad idea
[22:19:43] <two2thehead> yeah
[22:20:01] <feep> okay, enough fallout for now.
[22:20:04] <gwern> yeah. the simulated-annealing paradigm is not surprised by the fact that if you're cuckoo already, psychedelics may make you much more cuckoo, particularly if you're doing them like daily
[22:20:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Good lord, these responses on this "progress" thread
[22:20:41] <rmmh> and even if they're not permanent effects, if you're using ketamine daily, that's basically the same thing, isn't it?
[22:21:02] <gwern> given the ketamine links to neurogenesis...
[22:21:20] <two2thehead> hm TIL
[22:21:40] <rmmh> that's why I stick to safe drugs like alcohol. it just kills things and causes cancer, straightforward effect profile
[22:21:56] <snav> it's interesting, i feel like it's almost not possible to talk about serotonergic drugs without making reference to the fact that the mind is functionally a cybernetic system, so "more open" ultimately means "more receptive to environmental feedback"
[22:22:03] <gwern> (and increases blood pressure and vascular problems and other things)
[22:22:21] <rmmh> gwern: right, it's a poison trying to kill you
[22:22:33] <rmmh> I can deal with that. Forced enlightenment is TOO FAR
[22:22:44] <gwern> (plus you have the weirdness of gaba and alcohol dependency, and delirium tremens. there's pretty much no psychedelic addictive in that way)
[22:23:00] <snav> so if you're in an environment where "going crazy" (and it's important to precisely define what that means) is something rewarded via feedback loops...
[22:23:53] * snav drops a pile of psychoanalysis texts on his foot and runs off into the sunset...
[22:24:06] <gwern> I wonder what 'set and setting' you'd need to *normalize* someone with psyechedelics
[22:24:11] <feep> "[20:54] <snav> so if you're in an environment where "going crazy" (and it's important to precisely define what that means) is something rewarded via feedback loops..." cough los angeles cough
[22:24:19] <snav> ahahaha
[22:24:20] <rmmh> gwern: the 1960s
[22:24:45] <gwern> rmmh: I mean pull the crazy person back to the real world, not the real world to the crazy person :)
[22:25:10] <gwern> catalogue all their weird beliefs before the session and criticize them?
[22:25:13] <snav> gwern: one where desire (set) aligns with the result of socially normative action (setting)
[22:25:43] <mst> feep: cough tumblr cough
[22:25:57] <pompolic> so they gotta want to be normal?
[22:26:09] <feep> tumblr is just internet sf
[22:26:16] <snav> i also tend to think that most of the psychological changes (annealing) occurring as a result of psychedelic use takes place well after the fact, as the taker integrates their experience
[22:26:51] <snav> in other words: put someone in a normal environment where their needs are being met, dose them in a proper setting where they can safely explore their priors, and then wait
[22:28:15] <snav> i think the problem is that "unmet needs" are like so rampant and pervasive that this is actually... pretty hard?

[23:53:52] <aweinstock> Obormot\Arcturus: regarding potato mashers, what design defects does https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/514O+k75FCL._AC_SY300_SX300_.jpg have relative to https://img.thrfun.com/img/082/217/potato_masher_l1.jpg?

[23:54:09] <aweinstock> the main differences I see are the pattern on the metal disc, and the way the disk is attached to the handle
[23:54:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> aweinstock: Correct, those are the big differences
[23:55:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> aweinstock: The latter will cause the metal arms to be more likely to fatigue, deform, and split. The former will make it worse at mashing.
[23:57:57] <spxtr> won't the flat arms/attachments make it less likely to break due to torque on the flat bit?
[23:58:07] <aweinstock> the way the triangular wedges are positioned opposite each other cause the potato parts to rotate as it's being mashed or something like that?
[23:58:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> spxtr: Explain?
[23:58:17] <mst> gwern: maybe the app was running an a Red Hat server and was showing loyalty
[23:58:48] <aweinstock> (as opposed to the uniform grid of holes)
[23:58:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> aweinstock: Note, the "better" masher pictured isn't without flaws itself - notably, the attachment point of the metal assembly to the wooden handle, where the glue can dry out with time, causing looseness and separation. But this is fixable more easily, because the failure mode is simply separation of rigid parts, rather than deformation or cracking etc.
[23:59:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> aweinstock: The angles cut through the potato as it's pressed down, and the thinner slots force more breaking-apart
[23:59:36] <spxtr> Obormot\Arcturus: one masher has flat bands for arms, which will be much more resilient to torques if you're pressing down on potatos that aren't centered under the masher
[23:59:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> spxtr: No, that's not true
[23:59:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> spxtr: The flat bands will indeed be *less* resilient in such circumstances
