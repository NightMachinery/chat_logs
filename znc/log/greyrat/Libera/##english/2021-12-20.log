[01:21:59] <Guest12> Hi there. I need help with "selecting keyword" in application development. I'm trying to use English words. Let me explain it simply so as not to deviate from the subject; I need a word to describe "date/time" for "Press Statement". For example, I'm using "created_at" keyword to store the creation DateTime of the Press Statement. What can I use to
[01:22:00] <Guest12> describe the "statement happened at"?
[01:22:19] <Guest12> Is `statement_at` correct for this?
[01:22:51] *** Joins: immibis (~hexchat@62.156.144.218)
[01:25:58] <spinningcat> vague means it is not really obvious
[01:26:12] <spinningcat> i guess it is similar to fuzzy logic
[01:28:00] <Guest12> For my case, a colleague suggested "maked_at". It sounds wrong but could it be true?
[01:30:51] <TimMc> That would be "made_at". But how about "issued_at"?
[01:31:33] <TimMc> Or, is it actually the time at which to make the press release record public?
[01:32:05] <Guest12> Yes, it's absolute datetime of the "press statement" publicly happened.
[01:32:37] <TimMc> So this is like a historical record of a past event?
[01:33:15] <TimMc> Or, to put it another way: Is this a timestamp that has already happened, even when it is first recorded in the database?
[01:33:16] <Guest12> Or maybe future datetime. I'm using "past tense" for keywords in database. So we can thing like "past"
[01:33:27] <Guest12> Mostly "not happened yet"
[01:35:20] <Guest12> I think I'll use "issued_at" for storing "the datetime of statement was made"

[01:51:20] <TimMc> I'm not asking because of the tense of the verb, but because I'm wondering if it's a value that can change.
[01:52:06] <Guest12> Yes, it is.
[01:52:13] <TimMc> If it's a predicted/scheduled value like the time at which the press statement *will* be made, I would use scheduled_for or event_time or similar.
[01:52:32] <TimMc> Those are less "final" in feel.
[01:53:54] *** Joins: giu (~giu@151.57.9.94)
[01:54:21] <TimMc> When you say "press statement", is this a live media event? Or are you talking about a written press release?
[01:55:53] <twb> Traditionally it is live for the reporters physically present, and they then make notes and put it in their next newspaper
[01:56:34] <twb> A "press release" is a document which usually says "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE" at the top
[01:58:14] <Guest12> Good to know that. I'll use **will** variant when showing content to the user but on the "database" side technically we should use "past" even content describing "future". Also, content can be "live media" or "written press" (so both).
[01:59:33] <Guest12> I will pay attention to the information you provide while showing content to the user.

[22:52:12] <mdogg> Hey blkshp:  If you run /msg NickServ INFO mdogg on me, does it say anything about my having Nick protection enabled?
[22:52:13] <LuisM18> xD
[22:52:43] <blkshp> Negative
[22:53:15] <mdogg> What is Nick Protection?  
[22:53:27] <mdogg> When I run it on you, it shows that you have it which is why I got curious.
[22:53:44] <LuisM18> can't use the nick
[22:53:51] <mdogg> got = became *
[22:55:05] <mdogg> Can't use the nick?  But that's the case for any registered nickname.
[22:56:44] <brigand> With Nick Protection enabled someone who tries to join the server with that nick name has to identify within a certain amount of time. Usually 60 seconds, sometimes even only 30 seconds.
[22:56:50] <blkshp> if you're not here, I can /nick mdogg
[22:57:09] <blkshp> if im not here and you /nick blkshp it will give you 15 seconds to log in or it will kick you out

[22:58:04] <LuisM18> not kick out, renick you actually

[22:58:25] <blkshp> ^^ yeah, what LuisM18 said
[22:58:31] <blkshp> mdogg: yes
[22:59:16] <LuisM18> you can enable it
[22:59:49] <brigand> You should be able to turn it on with /msg nickserv ENFORCE on
[22:59:58] <blkshp> /ns set enforce on
[22:59:59] <LuisM18> yea ^^
[23:00:01] <blkshp> yes!
[23:00:08] <blkshp> I had to test it first!
[23:01:46] <mdogg> Oh sweet - thanks guys!
[23:02:03] <blkshp> you can also change the time with ENFORCETIME
[23:05:20] <mdogg> What's the default?  I can't seem to execute a command to see what the default is.  I found the command to set it, though:  /msg NickServ SET ENFORCETIME Time | Default
[23:05:49] <mdogg> I guess 15 seconds is reasonable.  I can just set it as that.  And since I authenticate with SASL there shouldn't be a problem with me not authenticating within 15 seconds.
[23:06:58] <blkshp> 30 seconds it seems
[23:07:59] <mdogg> I made it 15 - thanks again.  
[23:08:22] <LuisM18> guess that's network dependent
[23:08:48] <blkshp> yarp
[23:08:56] <mdogg> Yeah, there's probably a script where a Network Op can set the default.
[23:13:21] <LuisM18> well, irc servers use config files, from my experience .. though netops can run commands on irc to change stuff :p
