[04:47:03] <fentanyl> So, in this context, how can I frame that sentence?
[04:47:16] <mdogg> Where did you get those sentences from, though?  The term "neither / nor" does make sense to a point, but then there is another condition that is inserted at the end that doesn't make sense.
[04:47:19] <fentanyl> I need to include both secular and 'religion' part.
[04:48:09] <fentanyl> mdogg: Which sentences?
[04:48:20] <twb> fentanyl: so then surely you're arguing that they *CAN* incorporate (steal from) other religious practices?
[04:48:21] <mdogg> The ones in your examples.  A and B.
[04:49:45] <fentanyl> twb: No, I'm trying to say that religious elements of one religion lets call it Foo cannot be made 'secular' and other religions like Bar also cannot culturally appropriate Foo's religious practices to fit into Bar's religion.
[04:49:47] <mdogg> Most religions do incorporate aspects of other religions.  "Try and be the best person you can be" if nothing else..
[04:50:09] <fentanyl> So, I'm framing that sentence in this context.
[04:51:07] <fentanyl> mdogg: Yeah, but practices of some religions runs contrary to that of others, so one cannot incorporate everything :)

[04:55:06] <fentanyl> Can a religious practice be secular?
[04:56:14] <mdogg> Actually, I would argue that being an atheist is a religion.
[04:56:18] <fentanyl> and can a practice of one religion such as praying to XYC God be incorporated into a religion which prays (only) to ABC God?

[04:57:27] <mdogg> Well, we are getting a long way off topic, fentanyl..  But your last example does make sense.  
[04:58:00] <twb> fentanyl: e.g. genital cutting is a religious practice among Jews, but among Americans its done "because it was done to me, so it must be a good idea" and religion doesn't really enter into it
[04:59:11] <mdogg> Actually, that's not a bad example.. 
[05:00:00] <fentanyl> Yes, circumcision have medical pros like less urinary tract infection or save oneselves from frenulum tear although its a religious practice by Jews.
[05:00:06] <twb> Another test case would be "civil law" versus "canon law"

[05:02:08] <mdogg> To whom are you trying to write this sentence?
[05:02:18] <twb> Hard for me to think of it since it's clearly nonsense
[05:02:45] <mdogg> Yeah - I have to agree with twb.  Without an example I can't comprehend the underlying meaning.
[05:04:54] <mdogg> I am religious, but I'm pretty open, too.  I mean - know people who are anti-religion and I know people who are so anti-religion that I consider them to be in an 'anti-religion' religion (so to speak)...
[05:05:00] <fentanyl> Here is one example, praying to Jesus isn't secular because it runs contrary to other religions Islam or Hinduism or even atheists. And Christian practice such as Baptism cannot be incorporated by other religions since its clearly Christian.
[05:05:34] <twb> fentanyl: is it?
[05:05:39] <fentanyl> Yes.

[05:07:08] <twb> I mean it's literally christianising in the etymologically sense of "anointing"
[05:10:01] <mdogg> I think we are beyond what this channel's design. 
[05:10:14] <mdogg> er, this channel's intent.
[05:10:30] <fentanyl> Yeah, but I noted that example since you've asked for one. 
[05:10:53] <fentanyl> (I already mentioned we're side tracking :P )
[05:11:23] <mdogg> "Secular" denotes attitudes, activities, that have no religious or spiritual basis.   
[05:11:30] <fentanyl> So, given that, can we use "could" after "neither"?
[05:11:35] <mdogg> Therefore, something that is secular cannot be religious.
[05:11:44] <fentanyl> Like, "neither could it be" or "neither it could be"
[05:12:12] <fentanyl> ^^ 
[05:12:14] <fentanyl> ?
[05:12:49] <mdogg> Neither could what be?
[05:12:51] <fentanyl> I'm not sure "could" come after/before "it".
[05:13:27] <mdogg> "Something secular cannot be religious."
[05:16:19] <fentanyl> So, a subject cannot come before the verb. And since "could" is a verb and "it", which is refering to the religious practice, is the subject of that sentence, I guess "[...] neither could it be" is correct per subject-verb agreement I guess.
[05:17:47] <twb> Are you just asking how to use either/or/neither/nor ?
[05:18:04] <twb> "A cat is not a dog, nor is it a bear"
[05:18:16] <twb> "A cat is neither a dog nor a bear."
[05:18:35] <fentanyl> Yeah, so in this case, it cannot be written like "A cat is not a dog, not it is a bear" is incorrect right?
[05:18:48] <fentanyl> Since the verb "is" must come before the subject "it"
[05:18:50] <fentanyl> right?
[05:18:59] <twb> *NOR
[05:19:33] <twb> "A cat is not a dog; nor is it a bear" sounds fine to me.
[05:19:35] <fentanyl> Yeah, but next to nor but before "it" (subject)
[05:19:47] <twb> fentanyl: oh I see
[05:19:51] <twb> fentanyl: yes, I agree there
[05:19:58] <fentanyl> Yeah, that was all I was asking.
[05:20:06] <twb> You could also form it using more common affirmative words:

[05:23:52] <fentanyl> sorry about that
[05:24:26] <twb> no worries
[05:24:38] <LuisP14> subject-verb inversion
[05:29:00] <LuisP14> verb being instead the auxiliary when present
[05:31:12] <fentanyl> So, I guess, I can remember when a sentence begins with 'not' or 'here and there', verb comes before the subject like mentioned here: https://dictionary.cambridge.org/grammar/british-grammar/inversion (since those two cases are the main ones that I will be using)
[05:31:52] <fentanyl> *aux verb to be specific
[05:33:05] <fentanyl> Since in the sentence "Not for a movment did I think I will fail the exam." so in this, 'did' is aux verb wihch came first followed by subject "I" and followed by a verb "think".
[05:33:18] <fentanyl> Just to make sure, "think" is the verb in here right?
[05:33:28] <fentanyl> Since it's the action.

[16:16:41] <braxas> hi, say I have two noun-phrases, "The car" and "The red car over there in front of the fire hydrant" - I would call the second phrase more qualified than the first, but I think maybe I'm not using qualified right
[16:16:52] <braxas> is there a better way to refer to the second statement?
[16:17:21] <braxas> but maybe not
[16:17:39] <braxas> to me "over there in front of the fire hydrant" are additional qualifiers, additional to red
[16:18:04] <braxas> another way I can say it is, the second is less ambigious
[16:18:17] <braxas> but I would rather prefer to state it in positive terms not in negative terms
[16:18:32] <braxas> so rather more qualified, than less ambigious

[16:34:54] <dfcnvt> If you are speaking informally with an actual presence next to the person -- while seeing the red car and the fire hydrant -- then that might be more sense to speak that way.  Otherwise, if you are writing paper with no visual aid of what's the surrounding of it.  Then I would rephrase it as, "The red car next to the fire hydrant."  Or "The red car in front of the fire hydrant"

[18:10:18] <braxas> dfcnvt: they are qualifiers I in that context I think - http://www.fe.hku.hk/telec/pgram/5-gr/534f/534-003.htm "When a prepositional phrase is part of a noun group (the ferry to Macau), it functions as a Qualifier to the 'Thing' Glossary in the noun group. A Qualifier gives us more information about the noun that expresses the Thing (ferry)."
[18:10:45] <braxas> dfcnvt: https://studfile.net/preview/5188691/page:131/ "6.80 As well as being used as adjuncts after verbs, prepositional phrases can be used after nouns as qualifiers to give information about place."
[18:12:46] <braxas> dfcnvt: https://www.scientific-editing.info/blog/what-is-a-preposition/ "These are commonly used as a qualifier to help describe a new piece of information or statement brought to light."
[18:12:56] <braxas> So maybe re-read again
[18:15:02] <braxas> I think maybe I am using qualified correctly
[18:15:32] <braxas> both adjectives and preopositions can be qualifiers, and in my sentence they were qualifiers
[18:16:50] <braxas> so I don't think it is wrong exactly to say that one difference between the phrases "The car" and "The red car over there in front of the fire hydrant" is that the second has more qualifiers, and is thus more qualified, but I am unsure if this is the right way to capture this quality of the second sentence
[18:17:29] <braxas> and again I'm pretty sure I'm using the word quality correctly there
