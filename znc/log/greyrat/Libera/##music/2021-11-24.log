[02:34:46] <louipc> music and corn
[02:34:57] <louipc> and sometimes korn
[02:35:06] <punchbag> I know the first, is the second some kind of pun?
[02:35:16] <louipc> i dont know what it is but it is

[02:39:32] <punchbag> I remember I used to listen to Korn
[02:42:22] <louipc> wow mps still around
[02:42:37] <louipc> did you get your own api 
[02:43:03] <punchbag> Yeah, I mean there's mpv, yt-dlp and youtube-dl, and others also spotdl
[02:43:21] <punchbag> Yeah, unfortunately no other way around that, had to get it
[02:43:42] <punchbag> I disabled tracking but you know gahoogahole
[02:44:12] <punchbag> I used a backup account
[02:44:44] <punchbag> The reason I wanted to try mps was the controls, I really liked them
[02:45:24] <punchbag> mpv is very automated, with mps you can control and see the tracks like a player, albeit in the terminal
[02:45:25] <punchbag> neat
[02:45:31] <louipc> i have to try yt-dlp
[02:45:52] <louipc> i use youtube-dl since forever
[02:46:05] <punchbag> Fixes the throttling on youtube-dl, but both suffer when streaming video
[02:46:20] <punchbag> yeah, they haven't updated youtube-dl in a while
[02:46:34] <punchbag> spotdl is also neat
[02:47:37] <punchbag> Used to listen to Korn and many others on my minidiscs, anybody remember those? xd
[02:48:57] <louipc> yea it looked so cool
[02:49:01] <louipc> never got it tho
[02:49:20] <punchbag> yeah, walking around with one of those was like been famous XD

[19:24:30] <nativetexan> cool
[19:24:35] <Panther> Typing that stuff in was a drag.
[19:25:15] <Panther> I am gonna take the playlists I have from YT and format them into some UML/JSON like structure he can use to add the ond ones in.
[19:25:41] <Panther> Still.. the stdio is down.
[19:25:49] <nativetexan> and the list will be published or something?

[22:11:03] <DOMF> I was using it way too much
[22:11:04] <Prints> yea, ive actually noticed i'm slightly depenent on it
[22:11:15] <Prints> i drink like 9-12g a time
[22:11:20] <DOMF> whoa 
[22:11:22] <morlog> it is an opiate 
[22:11:25] <nativetexan> whoa
[22:11:26] <DOMF> no
[22:11:29] <Prints> i was on heroin for a long ass time though.. so it's nothing for me xD
[22:11:32] <DOMF> it has similar effects to an opiate
[22:11:40] <morlog> close enough
[22:11:42] <DOMF> <Prints> i was on heroin for a long ass time though.. so it's nothing for me xD <-- SAME! 
[22:11:48] <Prints> lol
[22:11:55] <DOMF> that's why I keep getting hooked on kratom 
[22:12:07] <morlog> glad opiats have never been an issue for me
[22:12:07] <DOMF> it's a slight resemblance to that dragon 
[22:12:13] <Prints> i feel like it's somewhat acceptable considering the alternatives
[22:12:19] <morlog> benefits of being a masochist
[22:12:24] <Prints> when i dont have it though, i get classic withdrawal symptoms
[22:12:25] <DOMF> it is, but I don't like being dependent on anything 
[22:12:25] <morlog> i live for the pain
[22:12:29] <DOMF> yeah same 
[22:12:32] <DOMF> fucking HATE WDs
[22:12:37] <Prints> yea man
[22:13:04] <louipc> so u get high off it
[22:13:06] <Prints> i kicked methadone after 5 years, 120mg/day... that was a hard one
[22:13:38] <morlog> yeah
[22:13:41] <morlog> props
[22:13:44] <DOMF> methadone is the worst
[22:13:51] <DOMF> the WDs from it last like a fucking year
[22:13:54] <morlog> savoxin is worse
[22:13:55] <Prints> yea its pretty hardcore
[22:14:05] <DOMF> if I had to do it over again, I would have NOT done 'done
[22:14:07] <morlog> suboxin, however you spell it
[22:14:23] <Prints> suboxin is actually worse than methadone imo
[22:14:31] <morlog> watched way too many friends go through that
[22:14:39] <morlog> not very many have made it
[22:14:46] <Prints> yea, ive lost friends, girlfriends, family
[22:15:03] <DOMF> I would just do a really bad week of H withdrawals 
[22:15:04] <Prints> no bueno
[22:15:18] <morlog> there is only 1 person i know irl that has succesfully gotten and stayed clean

[22:15:34] <Prints> yea i used to just go thru the wd.. and then as soon as it was over, go cop again xD
[22:15:41] <Prints> like wtf.. no sense
[22:15:50] <DOMF> and what do you mean suboxin is worse
[22:16:00] <morlog> you either get better or you die
[22:16:09] <morlog> the withdrawls
[22:16:16] <DOMF> I haven't done it myself but everything I"ve read about it and everyone I know who's used it says that it's miles ahead/better than 'done
[22:16:20] <Prints> subs are just an insanely powerful opioid.. 
[22:16:30] <morlog> i have a friend thats taking them to kick right now
[22:16:40] <DOMF> you don't die
[22:16:46] <Prints> with any of them, you just end up trading one addiction for another
[22:16:46] <DOMF> opioid WDs can't kill you
[22:16:50] <morlog> they are an opiate antagonist, not an opiode
[22:17:01] <DOMF> well, suboxin has two things in it
[22:17:05] <DOMF> bupe and narcan
[22:17:46] <Prints> lol when i was on methadone i was taking xanax alot.. then id go thru benzo detox and throw up my methadone doses and be fucked.. i dont remember those mornings fondly.. leaving the clinic trying not to vomit lol
[22:18:50] <Prints> in LA, seeing someone vomiting in the bushes isn't that uncommon though lol
[22:19:02] <morlog> same here
[22:19:38] <morlog> austin has a really bad dope problem
[22:19:57] <Prints> yea, it's really taken off all over the US
[22:20:36] <Prints> i started w opioids a long ass time ago.. and then it kinda got normalized for a while.. even the people in my life were like 'oh he needs it'
[22:20:38] <morlog> heroin has been a problem here far longer than the nationwide issue
