[03:04:52] <abrotman> ping and a DNS lookup aren't really the same thing.  Your ISP doesn't have DNS you can use?
[03:05:14] <manokit> not any that i know of, my router has its own DNS but that didn't work either
[03:05:37] <manokit> abrotman, ping google.com resulted in a name resolution error, so they are similar in this case
[03:06:17] <greycat> sounds like your system is behind a firewall that blocks all DNS traffic (except, one presumes, traffic to the firewall's owner's DNS resolvers)
[03:06:30] <abrotman> I meant  that pinging 8.8.8.8 and being able to query are not the same
[03:06:32] <greycat> you'll need to find out what those intended DNS resolvers are, and use those, or else find a way to bypass this firewall
[03:06:49] <manokit> abrotman, i get you now
[03:07:10] <manokit> greycat, i am the network operator and can confirm, there are 0 firewall rules for DNS
[03:07:59] <greycat> then "dig @8.8.8.8 www.google.com" should work
[03:08:18] <greycat> if it doesn't, then there is a firewall.  somewhere.

[04:09:09] <abrotman> doesn't that depend which mtr you have installed?
[04:09:57] <rawtaz> could it simply be a matter of the ISP blocking dns to 8.8.8.8? it seems some traffic to that host work (ping) but not other (dns)
[04:10:17] <abrotman> I asked about ISP DNS, no response
[04:10:18] <rawtaz> (as in, them wanting you to use their dns servers or something)
[04:10:18] <randall> Possibly, I started using -t long ago and didn't check again since.
[04:10:32] <abrotman> also, not actually using Debian
[04:10:37] <rawtaz> could try other dns servers as well to see if it applies there too.

[04:10:45] <abrotman> see
[04:10:52] <abrotman> why solve problems ..
[04:10:53] <greycat> you can try other public resolvers and see if any of them work, or you can continue on the mtr path
[04:10:56] <manokit> i prefer automation, it fixes everything
[04:11:03] <rawtaz> manokit: did that make the exact same command work?
[04:11:08] <randall> manokit: Did it fix your issue?
[04:11:12] <manokit> probably
[04:11:17] <manokit> i mean, it was installing packages
[04:11:20] <rawtaz> please verify and let us know :)
[04:11:23] <manokit> thats something proxmox was unable to do
[04:11:32] <rawtaz> i mean, it would be mentally insane if that fixed it.
[04:12:17] <greycat> Google gives me many results for "proxmox dns not working"
[04:12:46] <rawtaz> if proxmox is involved im not surprised about anything lol xD

[04:13:29] <rawtaz> manokit: are you just replacing debian now, in a VM of the same config on the same proxmox?
[04:13:46] <rawtaz> as in, is it just the OS that changes or are you changing something else too?

[04:33:23] <randall> And with it any way to actually debug the issue.
[04:33:41] <manokit> too bad this is a practically useless OS to me
[04:34:07] <randall> !ubuntu
[04:34:08] <dpkg> Ubuntu is based on Debian, but it is not Debian.  Only Debian is supported on #debian.  Use #ubuntu on irc.libera.chat instead.  Even if the channel happens to be less helpful, support for distributions other than Debian is offtopic on #debian.  See also <based on debian> and <ubuntuirc>.
[04:34:27] <randall> manokit: You can find Ubuntu support on #ubuntu. ^^^

[14:49:33] *** Quits: alMalsamo (~alMalsamo@gateway/tor-sasl/almalsamo) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[14:50:04] <PerfDave> You can run a DNS server behind a router, and tell the router to port-forward 53/udp and 53/tcp to it.
[14:50:20] <Aarch64debian> ok i want a dynamic dns service with port forward
[14:50:27] <PerfDave> If you're exposing a private DNS server to the Internet however, you're probably doing something wrong
[14:50:39] <rawtaz> then configure your router to do the port forward, and use e.g. dynu.com for a free dyndns service

[14:54:19] <Aarch64debian> smth like this
[14:54:49] <PerfDave> Aarch64debian: What do you mean?
[14:55:15] <PerfDave> Do you just want a hostname that points at your home IP?
[14:55:25] <Aarch64debian> yes
[14:55:36] <Aarch64debian> pass thru router
[14:55:45] <PerfDave> Aarch64debian: Ignore "pass through router"
[14:55:54] <Aarch64debian> i dont have router access
[14:56:16] <PerfDave> Aarch64debian: There are two things here: having a hostname that points at your home IP, and port forwarding through the router to something behind it.
[14:56:23] <PerfDave> They are two separate problems
[14:56:50] <Aarch64debian> yes any free app?
[14:57:13] <PerfDave> Aarch64debian: Which of those two separate problems do you want to try and solve first?
[14:57:27] <Aarch64debian> first one
[14:58:15] <PerfDave> OK, who provides DNS for your domain currently?
[14:58:56] <Aarch64debian> i dont have a domain
[14:59:23] <tomreyn> if you don't have a domain to use for this, you can get free third+ level domains for this from some service providers, such as freedns.afraid.org
[14:59:38] <tomreyn> the service is often referred to as "dyndns"
[14:59:50] <Aarch64debian> secure?
[14:59:57] <tomreyn> banana?
[15:01:50] <Aarch64debian> is there anything free that serves like the one i linked
[15:02:08] <unborn> Aarch64debian: no
[15:04:18] <PerfDave> Most domain registrars and DNS hosts provide some kind of dynamic DNS. I use Mythic Beasts as my registrar and DNS host, and I can just run "curl" on a cronjob on my server to get dynamic DNS service.
[15:04:31] <Aarch64debian> the app peanut shell idk if its in limit time trial or limited functions with trial

[22:07:24] <johnfg> Like jelly thought, it looks like only firmware and microcode.  teamviewer also.
[22:08:27] <johnfg> And although I have teamviewer and have used it occasionally, I certainly don't *need* it.
[22:08:42] <jmcnaught> So you probably want those upgraded too.  Teamviewer would not be from Debian, so consider disabling its repository during the upgrade (probably in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/something.list)
[22:09:18] <johnfg> jmcnaught: Does the list look alright, otherwise?
[22:09:55] <jmcnaught> johnfg: no, the security lines are wrong. Did you just do a simple s/buster/bullseye/g substitution?
[22:10:36] <jmcnaught> !bullseye security
[22:10:36] <dpkg> The repository name for <security> updates has changed between buster and bullseye.  Now it is: "deb http://deb.debian.org/debian-security bullseye-security main". You should also have a line for <stable-updates>. See <sources.list> <bullseye/updates>. Note that you may need to adjust the Default-Release and pinning settings to match this change.
[22:12:05] <jmcnaught> Also https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/release-notes/ch-information.en.html#security-archive
[22:12:07] <johnfg> Yes
[22:12:47] <johnfg> Ok, I'll get that ready and probably do the upgrade tomorrow.  winter weather advisory, so have to start 2nd job early.
[22:13:10] <johnfg> jmcnaught: Thanks for your help, and for catching those things.
[22:13:15] <jmcnaught> If you have not read the rest of the release notes chapter 5 "Issues to be aware of for bullseye" maybe check those first too.

[22:14:36] <dpkg> Read (at least) the upgrading chapter of <release notes> https://deb.li/39cyD . TL;DR: In /etc/apt/sources.list change "buster" to "bullseye", fix the line for security updates (see <bullseye-security>), remove stable-specific lines like buster-backports. apt update && apt upgrade --no-new-pkgs && apt full-upgrade. 3rd party repos like <dmo> cause problems with upgrades. If working over ssh, upgrade ssh first, see <bullseye ssh upgrade>.

[22:46:51] <johnfg> jmcnaught: I had already read that, but have a question about slack (which I do use quite a bit).  Should I change buster to bullseye, and keep slack.list?  Or comment it out, change to bullseye, then upgrade it later?

[23:34:22] <TheBigK_> Cool_Fire: real    120m50.471s (thats even weirder)
[23:34:40] <TheBigK_> from localhost it ran fine
[23:35:51] <Cool_Fire> That is indeed a pretty weird amount of time for a sleep(3600)
[23:36:13] <Cool_Fire> Just over twice as long
[23:36:41] <FightingFalcon> KiB Mem :  7984976 total,  1727472 free,  1782340 used,  4475164 buff/cache
[23:36:44] <Cool_Fire> It's suspect, but I'm not sure what that means
[23:36:44] <FightingFalcon> What does this mean?
[23:37:22] <Cool_Fire> FightingFalcon: It just looks like memory stats? What meaning are you missing?
[23:37:29] <FightingFalcon> buff/cache
[23:37:50] <Cool_Fire> The amount of memory used by OS buffers and caches (usually this is mostly disk cache)
[23:38:32] <FightingFalcon> hm so i need more memory?

[23:39:33] <Cool_Fire> It's not really possible to draw any hard conclusions from the numbers alone without any context
[23:39:54] <Cool_Fire> But if I had to make a guess from looking at just those numbers, I wouldn't say so, no
[23:40:34] <FightingFalcon> ok
[23:40:36] <FightingFalcon> thanks .d
[23:40:55] <FightingFalcon> but it looks like only 1727472 kb is free?
[23:41:08] <Cool_Fire> That's about 1.6G totally free, doing nothing at all

[23:42:07] <Cool_Fire> The 4.3-ish GB of memory in use by buffers and caches can generally be reclaimed if it's needed for applications too. That's also why it's reported separately.
[23:43:07] <Cool_Fire> Linux will basically always try to fill all free memory with buffers and caches since it's fast to keep stuff in memory, and otherwise it's just doing nothing at all with that memory
[23:43:20] <FightingFalcon> hm ok i see
[23:43:22] <FightingFalcon> thanks

[23:44:59] <Cool_Fire> My workstation has 128G and it has 103G of buffers and caches. It'll just keep going as long as there's space :D
