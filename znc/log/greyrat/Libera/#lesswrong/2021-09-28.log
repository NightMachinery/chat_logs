[00:31:46] <Robomot> Review: Is a Vitamix Blender Worth the Splurge? I Wholeheartedly Think so (Vitamix blenders are widely considered the best, and their price reflects their track record of performance. I was impressed with how easy the Vitamix Ascent A3500 was to use out of the box and the tasks it could complete that would normally be reserved for a heavy-duty food processor or stand mixer.)
[00:31:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> "When I brought up Vitamix blenders in conversation, people would often ask if it was able to heat up soup. And, I can now answer from firsthand experience that it does indeed. For this experiment, I made Cauliflower Soup. I simply added the ingredients – which included raw cashews, leeks, and of course cauliflower - to the container and pressed the Hot Soup button. The soup is heated by the friction created by the blade so
[00:31:55] <Obormot\Arcturus>  it runs at high speeds for about six minutes. The resulting soup was piping hot and delicious."
[00:32:14] <saturn2> lol
[00:32:15] <rmmh> I hate heating liquids in plastic containers
[00:32:35] <galambo_> another question is...is it a more efficient use of my time to buy ready made soup?
[00:32:54] <rmmh> you just have to make soup with your vitamix a few thousand times to save money, maybe
[00:33:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I'll share one more surprising trick: coffee. My espresso maker was being temperamental recently (turns out I needed to delime it), and in order to have my morning cup of joe, I followed the Mocha Spiced Coffee instructions in the recipe book using instant espresso, milk, and flavorings. After five minutes of high-speed blending, I had a hot, frothy caffeine fix. Feel free to take the day off, espresso maker!"

[15:40:37] <PlanckWalk> Shoudl Chesterton's Fences be knocked down as a matter of course, to encourage documentation?
[15:40:54] <PapuaHardyNet> I've been thinking about your regular complaints about how Amazon's products are garbage. Perhaps that is *because* Amazon is a market with little to no barriers of entry
[15:42:18] <PlanckWalk> Partly, sure.
[15:42:27] <nshepperd2> it's because amazon goes to extreme lengths to make sure that sellers who sell garbage can't be punished
[15:42:37] <PlanckWalk> Yes, that's most of it.
[15:43:24] <nshepperd2> such as inventory comingling, which ensures that someone else gets the bad review
[15:45:30] <kuudes> I guess that could be good? cheap shit is shit, then there are brands who vet more the producers that get into their label and are priced to cover the cost of testing etc?
[15:45:43] <synthmeat> that dilution of reviews and ratings across sellers, variants, editions etc. is what bothers me the most personally.
[15:45:55] <nshepperd2> (and that someone else pays for the return)
[15:46:10] <kuudes> who?
[15:46:49] <nshepperd2> you buy a widget from seller A
[15:47:01] <nshepperd2> you actually receive a widget from seller B, bc of comingling
[15:47:09] <nshepperd2> the widget is broken, you return it
[15:47:19] <yorick> “I have strong opinions on this topic but haven’t thought about it that much.”
[15:47:27] <nshepperd2> seller A pays for the return
[15:47:43] <kuudes> oh?
[15:48:00] <kuudes> did A pay for B for the widget?
[15:48:07] <kuudes> what is comingling?
[15:48:22] <PlanckWalk> Putting product from different suppliers into the same box.
[15:48:44] <kuudes> idgi
[15:48:52] <nshepperd2> amazon just dumps anything that claims to be the same widget into the same crate
[15:49:02] <nshepperd2> when you buy one, one is pulled out at random
[15:49:03] <kuudes> if you only get widget from B then you did not receive anything from A
[15:49:03] <PlanckWalk> Emphasis on "claims to be"
[15:49:23] <kuudes> does B get any money?
[15:49:34] <PlanckWalk> A and B supply Amazon with the "same" widget.  When you buy from A, Amazon pulls one out of the mixed box.
[15:49:53] <PlanckWalk> If it's knock-off crap from B, then A takes the hit on return and review.
[15:50:07] <kuudes> but B didn't get any money?
[15:50:10] <PlanckWalk> Right.
[15:50:17] <PlanckWalk> But they do when you buy from B
[15:50:25] <kuudes> why would they produce stuff to sold without getting any money?
[15:50:30] <PlanckWalk> (and you may get a great product actually made by A)
[15:52:13] <PlanckWalk> They do get some money, just not specifically from the people who end up with *their* product.
[15:52:39] <PlanckWalk> A bunch of people supposedly buying from A get a mixture of products made by A and B.
[15:52:44] <PlanckWalk> A bunch of people supposedly buying from B also get a mixture of products made by A and B.
[15:53:18] <PlanckWalk> Because they're all mixed together and even Amazon (they say) doesn't know which ones are which.
[15:53:35] <PlanckWalk> They just know how many they bought and sold.
[15:55:56] <PlanckWalk> B sends 50 crap batteries to Amazon.  Amazon dumps then in a bucket and says "50 of these came from B".  They update B's inventory to reflect that B now has 50 batteries in stock.
[15:56:18] <kuudes> it seems that it is not mandatory
[15:56:28] <kuudes> so just don't opt into that?
[15:57:12] <PapuaHardyNet> interesting

[15:58:57] <kuudes> PlanckWalk, you can buy from sellers who do not participate
[15:59:07] <PlanckWalk> Yes, if you know who they are.
[15:59:13] <kuudes> yes
[15:59:19] <kuudes> if you buy random shit, you get random shit
[15:59:34] <kuudes> if you don't want random shit, don't buy random shit?

[16:03:38] <kuudes> buy from some brand that makes their brand about some brand promise

[16:04:48] <nshepperd2> amazon has a variety of methods of ensuring that it's impossible to pay for quality on amazon

[21:40:41] <rmmh> 1400 is 93rd, 1500 is 98th
[21:41:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Most of my friends had 1500+

[22:18:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> My new beard trimmer came in... it charges via USB. That's cool and fine. But. Is really necessary to design it with a proprietary USB connector -_-
[22:19:48] <kuudes> was it that all appliances must be able to load through usb these days?
[22:19:55] <kuudes> or is it just cellphones?
[22:21:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> I actually am 100% fine with using USB for this but why not use a standard micro-USB-B or w/e?
[22:21:33] <kuudes> iirc the law was faulty and allowed a loophole for apple to get away with and it was related to that
[22:21:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, I have at least a dozen standard USB cables like that, but if I lose *this* cable I gotta go to the manufacturer
[22:22:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Do they even sell replacements?? Let's look!
[22:22:11] <kuudes> indeed. and apple has similar
[22:22:33] <kuudes> ie the outward connector is standard but inward connector is proprietary

[22:23:55] <pompolic> i'm getting there
[22:24:18] <pompolic> HID is basically a protocol for input devices
[22:24:24] <pompolic> a HID device is an input device
[22:24:34] <pompolic> i see no reason for a beard trimmer to speak HID, but it would be hilarious
[22:24:36] <rmmh> Obormot\Arcturus: are you sure it's proprietary and not miniusb?

[22:31:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> But Jared Harris as Hari Seldon, ok, yeah, that can work
[22:34:25] <rmmh> Obormot\Arcturus: it's apparently "inspired by" the book
[22:34:39] <rmmh> which makes sense given Asimov's characterization is too nonexistent to even rate as garbage
[22:34:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> rmmh: Well... actually it seems like they've brought in the prequels
[22:35:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which (a) is smart, (b) means they do get to use Asimov's characterization if they want
[22:35:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> He wrote the prequels decades later and was much better at writing characters by then
[22:36:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wow they gender-changed like half the characters
[22:36:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which... is understandable...ish
[22:36:35] <rmmh> lol
[22:36:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> On the other hand, it's also super dumb
[22:37:00] <kuudes> foundation had quite gender balanced character set at the start iirc?
[22:37:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> God no
[22:37:16] <rmmh> asimov basically didn't write women as agents 
[22:37:17] <kuudes> there was seldon's daughter, wife
[22:37:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's the prequels
[22:37:24] <kuudes> and then the gaian agent
[22:37:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's ... lol
[22:37:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> We don't talk about that book
[22:37:55] <pompolic> everything must be remade in FAANG's image
[22:38:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> No, but Seldon's wife, granddaughter, etc., aren't even in this!
[22:38:29] <kuudes> wife came in the second or third book, was it?
[22:38:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Seldon's?!
[22:38:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Absolutely not
[22:39:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> After _Foundation_ we don't get to see Hari Seldon at all until the prequels
[22:39:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> _Prelude to Foundation_ gives us Dors Venabili (later to be Seldon's wife)
[22:39:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> (she is not in this show)
[22:40:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> _Forward the Foundation_ gives us Seldon's granddaughter Wanda (also not in this show)
[22:40:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> But anyway
[22:40:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's like... ok, so you look at all the primary actors in the story (not counting _Foundation and Earth_ because... no) and you go "man, this is a real sausage party, we can't film this shit like this in 2021, gotta flip some" ... ok. Sure.
[22:41:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> But then if you look at the individual characters to do that to, it... doesn't make much sense
[22:42:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gaal Dornick, the nerdy genius mathematician? You could make him a woman but you can't make him interesting merely by doing that, so now he's, like, a *normie* woman - and makes no sense

[22:44:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hm actually they might be making Demerzel like an androgynous type of character (I'm guessing based on some stuff I see), but if that's true then that rather misses the point of the character

[23:25:36] <catern> lots of other things are unproductive labor but not being cracked-down-upon
[23:25:53] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: between tags and recursive popups, this is most of the way to a production system. I wonder what substitution rule it'd take to make gwern.net popups turing-complete
[23:27:44] <pompolic> uhhh
[23:27:50] <pompolic> i should be able to answer that exactly
[23:27:55] <pompolic> not to imply i can
[23:28:03] <pompolic> post grammar
[23:29:03] <pompolic> having things like <html style brackets> yeets you into context-sensitive territory

[23:34:05] <kuudes> hmm. now if the world is heading to supply crisis, and over here we don't yet have such, what should I hoard currently?
[23:35:20] <pasky>   What would be the best reading starting point to explore unusual space-related business ideas with relatively short time to value (~10y)? (In the ~$100M range; <<$1Bn anyhow.)
[23:35:50] <kuudes> something on musk's public reading list?

[23:37:32] <kuudes> personal use

[23:52:10] <two2thehead> gwern, soon.tiff
[23:53:03] <two2thehead> soon graphics cards will be so abundant that they'll be at least a stdv cheaper compared to ten years ago with an order of magnitude higher performance per dollar
[23:53:38] <gwern> that would be highly disappointing
[23:54:27] <gwern> I think we're already well past an order cheaper than a decade agoanyway
[23:54:38] <two2thehead> I'll just be happy if the price hike resulting from crypto miners are nullified
[23:55:09] <two2thehead> also you probably know more about know about hardware than me so I defer to you wrt the specifics
