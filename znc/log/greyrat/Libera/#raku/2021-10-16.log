[00:22:03] <berber44> mfiano: could you name the language with multiple dispatch methods as top constructs? I want to study more about it.
[00:25:58] <berber44> As for the Raku's binding methods to classes, I think that just because most users are accustomed to this, since this how things are in the top 5 or more languages

[00:58:13] <melezhik> lizmat - the log server has a very nice design!
[00:58:21] <lizmat> thank you  :-)
[00:58:29] <melezhik> if this a permanent url?
[00:58:29] <lizmat> I will pass it on to the designer  :-)
[00:58:39] <lizmat> no, it's still in beta
[00:58:46] <melezhik> ah, ok
[00:58:58] <lizmat> until I really think it's production ready, I will be more vocal about it
[00:59:11] <lizmat> and it will probably get a URL under raku.org or raku.rocks
[00:59:30] <melezhik> logs page also looks really neat
[00:59:36] <timo> ooh that "gist" feature is cool
[00:59:49] <timo> it's kind of an evolution of the summary feature from ilbot2?
[00:59:57] <lizmat> I guess  :-)
[01:00:12] <timo> instead of storing it on the server, you just edit the URL with the data in it with the buttons
[01:00:39] <timo> though it's easier in the summary mode since there you turn on checkboxes for every line and need one click per line instead of two
[01:00:43] <melezhik> oh, it's even has a calendar, all the bells and whistles ... ))

[01:04:14] <lizmat> timo: yes, I know...  above my current layout paygrade I'm afraid
[01:04:51] <lizmat> it was quite a journey from me doing HTML seriously for the first time in 15 years, coming from HTML 0.9 basically  :)
[01:05:33] <melezhik> yeah, html is never easy thing )))
[01:06:02] <melezhik> https://logs.liz.nl/raku/live.html works fine ... cool
[01:06:50] <lizmat> server restart to fix search options on home page in mobile mode
[01:08:15] <timo> there's a max-height: 450px rule for dropdown content
[01:08:21] <timo> that's what makes the box too small
[01:09:10] <timo> with "overflow: hidden scroll" you can get a scrollbar for up/down scrolling and keep the maximum size
[01:09:45] <timo> not sure if a maximum size in actual pixels is a good choice, no clue how that interacts with hidpi and the like
[01:13:27] <lizmat> timo++   # added that to the CSS, and put live.  A reload should now give you scrollbar
[01:15:10] <timo> "scrollbar" interpreted as german kind of translates as "scrollable"

[16:28:57] <mfiano> "class Z is A is B is C does D does E does F {}" instead of "class Z is A, B, C does D, E, F {}" is not only more verbose, but it reads as if A and B, and B and C are relatives, when they may be disjoint.

[19:37:08] <raydiak> sena_kun: So, where I got hung up was that some of the errors there really should be addressed even if you don't immediately see visible breakage. Web broswers try extraordinarily hard to not reveal problems. It's like writing perl 5 without using strict and warnings. Everything seems fine until it isn't, under some combination of browser and platform that you haven't tested, or you make some change that seems
[19:37:10] <raydiak> harmless and it causes a mysterious bug, or whatever
[19:37:18] <raydiak> As such, it seemed rather dismissive to ask about visible problems, point out what I already had about some validator warnings being harmless, and not say anything about any of the specifics I highlighted. It seemed more like a response I'd expect from a salesman, if you can see what I mean.
[19:37:28] <raydiak> That said, I was fully aware that I could be reading attitudes into your comment which were not intended. So I decided that instead of continuing to take things the wrong way and make a jerk out of myself, it would be best for me to disengage, since my point was that you could be getting useful feedback from the validator and javascript console, which doesn't require my involvement anyway.
[19:37:38] <raydiak> I hope that makes sense. I neither assumed that I should or shouldn't be offended, I just decided to stop pursuing it. I hope I didn't cause you any undue stress, and again, I do very much appreciate what you've done on that project, and all the other work you do in our community.

[20:23:30] <[Coke]> rba: Looks like it's not built automatically - can we kick off a manual build against master for examples?
[20:30:33] <sena_kun> raydiak, I think we are not quite on the same page. You say "and not say anything about any of the specifics I highlighted" but I wrote "As for the warnings, we will address the bogus ones" as the second thing in my reply. This doesn't look to me like "nothing". As for my question about visual issues, that's due to me assuming people stumble upon bugs and then they start to investigate to save up some time and post problem B instead of problem A.
[20:31:07] <sena_kun> It's interesting in your reply you have this: "Maybe that's why the search form throws a JS error on sumbit" and "maybe that's why someone on IRC was reporting elements stacking in the wrong Z order under certain circumstances".
[20:31:40] <sena_kun> So there are bugs I asked about and welcomed to report! But a question about them is now dismissive.
[20:33:00] <sena_kun> With warnings or not, we certainly want to look at the visible ones (e.g. neither of those two I can reproduce with the steps I tried) and it's a cool thing to report them. :)
[20:34:20] <sena_kun> In any case, we severely lack web devs here, so any spare expertise and other efforts would help a lot IMO, booing others away is something I am familiar with and the last thing I can intend.
[20:35:57] <raydiak> the js error is in the js console, not visible unless you open that and look for it. search still works anyway, for whatever reason. I didn't see it until I was checking something else to write that comment. if you were being dismissive as I erroneously suspected, I would have expected to get the same resonse about that as the validator
[20:36:34] <raydiak> the other thing was not my observation to report, it was someone elses. I haven't even tried it on mobile yet, which I think is what whoever it was was talking about
[20:38:43] <lizmat> raydiak: thank you for your efforts and your time
[20:38:52] <lizmat> and of course sena_kun as well...
[20:39:10] <lizmat> I will look at the search JS error, that should be easy to fix :)
[20:39:40] <raydiak> when I say specifics, I mean I was pointing out particular points that you had no particular responses to. even lizmat was asking you specifically about the duplicated IDs in that thread, which you at the time hadn't said anything about. I'm not saying you did anything wrong, I'm just trying to explain where my perceptions went askew. I put the fault entirely on myself after sleeping on it
[20:41:00] <lizmat> I'm not sure... but I know at least two of us in this conversation do not have english as their first language  :-)
[20:41:17] <lizmat> subtleties can be missed / misinterpreted / etc.
[20:41:20] <sena_kun> No worries, maybe my reply was too morning one. As long as we can clear any misunderstanding it should be fine enough to move forward.
[20:41:40] <lizmat> yes, *that* I would really like to do :-)
[20:42:10] <lizmat> re mobile: on my iPhone, the channel pulldown doesn't work *except* on the day view
[20:42:54] <lizmat> now, if I make my browser window as small as a mobile phone on my MBP, it *does* work
[20:43:02] <lizmat> so I'm a bit flabbergasted...
[20:43:03] <raydiak> that's really all I'm trying to do, is explain what I misunderstood so you can maybe forgive me and not think of me as a jerk...too much :)
[20:43:27] <lizmat> people would have to do a lot to become a jerk in my book :-)
[20:43:50] <lizmat> but then, you will find it hard to get rid of that classification in my book  :-)
[20:44:31] <raydiak> fair enough :)
[20:46:12] <sena_kun> I don't think I do (think of someone as) and state it explicitly, the rest is up to anyone's self-judgment mechanism.
[20:48:12] <mfiano> Does Ovid come around these parts?
[20:50:35] <lizmat> mfiano: I can't recall seeing Ovid on any #raku named channels
[20:50:51] <lizmat> mfiano: which could very well be on account of my failing memory  :-)

[20:51:44] <mfiano> Also you sigil talk was very nice too :)
[20:51:59] <lizmat> mfiano: I'm glad to hear, on both accounts  :-)
[20:53:53] <mfiano> I'm glad to be here learning this wonderful language with such a great community. It's very freeing, having been locked to a single language for decades.

[21:18:26] <guifa> whoa
[21:18:40] <guifa> One of my tests just failed on new-disp.  Did something change with native number handling?
[21:18:58] <sena_kun> guifa, please report!
[21:19:06] <guifa> (there's nothing particularly weird in the module, and it's only one test so it's going to take a while to track down)
[21:19:46] <sena_kun> well, golfing it down will help a lot
[21:19:48] <guifa> sena_kun: not confirmed it's a native issue yet — it's in some code I ported from C so I'll try to golf it
[21:20:07] <guifa> well, first I have to figure out the exact issue, then I'll try to golf
[21:20:32] <[Coke]> when you say "new-disp", you mean master/HEAD, aye?
[21:22:20] <guifa> [Coke]: I'm going to test on master/HEAD next. But this build of new-disp was fairly close to the one that went to master/HEAD (new timezone data got released from IANA yesterday so I was pushing the update, and realized tests failed).  Was cleaning up code and then thought to try to on my old install of 2021.01, and tests passed again.
[21:22:46] <guifa> Going to install master now, and see if error still crops up
[21:23:08] <[Coke]> ok.
[21:23:17] <[Coke]> I just know there's been a few fixes since it was merged.
[21:24:21] <lizmat> quite a few actually :-)

[21:53:25] <guifa> part of it is also that it's a port of industry-standard C code.  I don't want to Raku-ify it too much because then if changes are made in the original, it'll be harder to update accordingly
[21:53:51] <guifa> and so it's probably an indictment of 80s-era C code that's designed to run on everything under the sun 
[21:54:07] <guifa> but I really should have commented more =/
[21:56:05] <lizmat> ain't that the (universal) truth :-)
[22:00:01] <guifa> to new-disp's credit, it DID find two other little bugs of routines I called, they were in conditionals and I'm guessing old one just returnd a falsy value and I got no warning
[22:01:56] <guifa> I am wondering though how quickly I should embrace the new-disp stuff.  It lets timezones work exactly as I'd always imagined it working BUT with the huge caveat that it would totally break on previous versions.  I don't think it can be reasonably version guarded either. 
[22:04:58] <japhb> lizmat: Ah, I was going off git describe counts -- I'm guessing it includes things that aren't source commits.
[22:11:23] <El_Che> lizmat: nice log site
