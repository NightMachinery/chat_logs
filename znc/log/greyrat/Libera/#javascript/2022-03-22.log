[02:19:43] <buu> blueagain: Yes, but I also use variables, notepads, texteditors, my brain, etc
[02:19:49] <buu> It's a subset
[02:19:53] <austincheney> blueagain, I use my computer's memory to hold data
[02:20:05] <ThePendulum> they can't hold data? I thought it was more that it's a bit of a pain to manage data shared between components
[02:20:07] <bomb> blueagain by data I mean data like that checkbox is selected, that radio buttin is active, etc.
[02:20:09] <buu> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget
[02:20:13] <ThePendulum> because you'd end up with all your data in one parent component
[02:20:22] <ThePendulum> or have I been using vue for way too long now
[02:20:29] <blueagain> bomb isn't that what react's states are for?
[02:20:36] <ashnur> wtf, components do hold data in react, it's one of the worst anti patterns, but it's the industry standard also
[02:20:42] <buu> lol
[02:20:53] <buu> ashnur: it's better than global god objects
[02:21:00] <bomb> blueagain kinda kinda, redux is called "state manager"
[02:21:05] <austincheney> buu, why is that?
[02:21:13] <systemfault> Intelo: NodeJS has event emitters built-in.. pick whatever the for DB, could be sqlite, an in-memory map... whatever.
[02:21:13] <ashnur> only as long as that global god object is mutable and you don't have everything namespaced
[02:21:15] <Intelo> buu ashnur  check, events won't happen auto. it needs click etc. but I have api call response fetched  as trigger of event
[02:21:16] <ThePendulum> for data that doesn't leave the component, like form or expand states, I don't see why it's an anti pattern
[02:21:20] <austincheney> I use a global object for state management and it works very well for me.
[02:21:24] <bomb> blueagain for SPA try Svelte you don't need any of these
[02:21:31] <Intelo> systemfault its web browser based. I am not in node
[02:21:42] <bomb> I kinda feel sorry for those who have to code React on a daily basis :P
[02:21:42] <ashnur> Intelo, yeah, you can trigger events as you want them.
[02:21:49] <austincheney> I only need to restore state on page refresh, because I am not letting some framework get something so simple and trivial so very wrong
[02:22:05] <blueagain> just keep your state in a database then?

[02:22:38] <blueagain> redux sounds like a solution looking for a problem

[02:24:01] <ashnur> blueagain, otoh, the single source of truth and the unidirectional data flow ideas have their merit. But everything else in redux is a bad idea imho.
[02:24:14] <buu> What else is there in redux?
[02:24:17] <Intelo> buu what would be "type" and what is x?

[02:25:23] <ashnur> ljharb, brings back the mainstream hammer
[02:25:24] <buu> Svelte has the same ux problem as react where you're going out of your way to annotate stuff =[
[02:25:39] <buu> It feels like calling malloc()
[02:25:51] <ashnur> state management in react is just bad. even with hooks.
[02:25:55] <Intelo> buu ashnur so no need for redux?
[02:26:12] <buu> Intelo: Look, it's a spectrum
[02:26:25] <buu> Intelo: At one end you have literally a map() where you store some keys and values
[02:26:32] <ashnur> I don't think there is any need, but then i have lots of colleagues who will like you if you do use it
[02:26:39] <ashnur> so it has societal value like bomb
[02:26:39] <buu> At the other end you have 15000 line pub/sub caching event dispatching systems
[02:26:50] <buu> Find the simplest one that works for you
[02:27:26] <ashnur> and simple != easy
[02:27:37] <buu> But, imo, stuff like redux shouldn't be used until you understand what problems it's actually solving, usually by running into them face first
[02:27:46] <austincheney> simple === fewer
[02:28:07] <blueagain> I don't get it, redux is entirely thing just to store you having selected a checkbox and then refreshed the page?
[02:28:13] <blueagain> a thing*
[02:28:13] <ashnur> buu, i really hate that people give that advice. imagine navigating like dodgem
[02:28:22] <buu> what?
[02:28:23] <ashnur> i rather avoid what is possible to avoid
[02:28:51] <ashnur> why you need to "run into [problems] face first" in order to you know you have to solve  them. why not avoid them?
[02:28:54] <Intelo> buu ashnur ok. I initially thought that events need clicks.  so if I do const resp = await fetch(...);  resp.addEventListener("??" ()...); resp.dispatcheven(.?.)   what would replace '?'  if I wanted to print value of resp in another listner funct?
[02:28:58] <ThePendulum> blueagain: at least for me it was to prevent clogging up the main container component with the state and methods/actions that multiple components on opposite ends of the application needed to use
[02:29:00] <buu> blueagain: No, redux is for coordinating a team of 1000+ engineers trying to all work on a single page made up of hundrds of components that needs to load in under a second
[02:29:35] <ThePendulum> blueagain: like I might need my login username in the header as well as the sidebar, I'd put that in redux or vuex so I don't have hundreds of vars like that in container.vue which is the only common parent for both
[02:29:36] <ashnur> not that you need it for that, it's just one way to organize people
[02:29:39] <blueagain> buu: you don't think it a problem that a single page has hundreds of components?
[02:29:40] <ashnur> give them a framework
[02:29:46] <buu> blueagain: ask facebook
[02:29:53] <buu> I didn't design it
[02:29:56] <ashnur> facebook had 70k components
[02:30:14] <ashnur> people trying to copy what corporations do, another big issue. like lifting state up
[02:30:28] <blueagain> 70k components all on one page?
[02:30:49] <farn> no, all over facebook.com
[02:30:54] <buu> ashnur: I mean, in the very abstract sense, yes, learn from other people's mistakes without making them yourself, that's progress. I guess the concept I'm going for here is "write the simplest code possible but no simpler"
[02:31:07] <farn> "Facebook" didn't design Redux by the way
[02:31:11] <ashnur> Intelo, think of these strings like names for functions, you give them names by describing what they do
[02:31:14] <ashnur> :P
[02:31:35] <ThePendulum> wow riotjs still exists and recently updated
[02:31:54] <ashnur> buu, if we take that literally, there is zero value in redux, since everything it does can be done much simpler
[02:32:11] <blueagain> ThePendulum: so the goal is that when you change your username it would change all over the page, whenever it's used?
[02:32:16] <blueagain> why not just reload the page?
[02:32:26] <ashnur> not saying there is no value in it, just that probably not best idea to reduce these ideas to simple heuristics like 'simplest but no too simple'
[02:32:33] <ThePendulum> I don't know if anything changed but when I last used redux, it was already incredibly simple to use, idk why I would go through the trouble of recreating it
[02:32:52] <ashnur> which is something I like btw, since almost all rich frontends end up failing it, they write their architecture way too simple for what is needed of it

[02:42:49] <ThePendulum> but in its defense, it has to find a balance between simplicity and functionality. you could always use a centralized parent component instead of redux, afaik, it's just not necessarily the most convenient option

[02:45:28] <ashnur> no, state management was never why we used react, they tried to implement it 4 different ways and they still failed
[02:45:44] <blueagain> react is basically like an excel datasheet. you update one cell, all other dependent cells update, that's reactivity, and that implies managing a state of all components

[03:09:51] <neshpion> that way my actual email address isn't in what you'd get if you curl, for example
[03:11:39] <ThePendulum> I don't know if that's the best solution to begin with, but either way I would put a class/ID on your element and put the code in a central JS file that is loaded either with a defer attribute or at the bottom of your body
[03:12:00] <systemfault> ThePendulum: Sounds like a good solution to me
[03:12:16] *** Quits: otisolsen70 (~otisolsen@xd4ed80b5.cust.hiper.dk) (Quit: Leaving)
[03:12:33] <ThePendulum> so <script src="assets/main.js" defer> document.querySelector('#contactEmail').href = `mailto:${me}@${domain}`;
[03:12:51] <neshpion> that's too sensible for my taste
[03:12:54] <ThePendulum> idk if that's going to fool a scraper
[03:13:07] <bomb> ashnur
[03:13:08] <ThePendulum> if you want to be sure I'd have a contact page that doesn't expose any email
[03:13:09] <neshpion> true, a sophisticated one might be running headless chrome or something
[03:13:30] <neshpion> oh, that's actually a good idea, i could let my web server forward text to my email server
[03:14:01] <ThePendulum> yeah that's the traditional solution, but will take a bit more effort

[03:14:59] <neshpion> i'd have to figure out how to send an email from my email server under one user to another user, but that should be a simple gander through some man pages
[03:15:01] <ThePendulum> if you're using gmail, protonmail or any of many other popular services you can add me+mysite@gmail.com too so you can separate it in your inbox, although it won't do much for separating legit mails from your site from spam
[03:15:20] <neshpion> i have my own server (dovecot+postfix)

[07:57:25] <Rockwood> DI is in PHP very good
[07:57:47] <Rockwood> weird in what sense?
[07:58:17] <Rockwood> Dependency Injection
[07:58:18] <systemfault> Unless React does some pretty insane magic... I don't believe that using useToggle in useEscape is going to refer to the internal state of your useToggle inside the component

[08:00:54] <systemfault> What I'm saying that you're using "useToggle" 2 times, one at line 9 of App.js, the other at line 4 of useEscape.js
[08:02:04] <systemfault> I don't know anything about hooks, but the expectation that they would both share the same state is probably untrue.
[08:03:02] <systemfault> If all usages of a hook would share the same internal state, hooks would simply be unusable

[08:04:42] <Rockwood> so i rejected that time
[08:06:16] <systemfault> Other than that, it seems that useToggle returns a tuple of 2 elements, first one being the state, second being a setter. But where you're destructuring at line 4 in useEscape, you're destructuring the first element of the tuple, the state, into a variable called setToggle... which is something that isn't returned at all from useToggle.

Further proof the code detectors don’t trigger on drawings.

[17:40:45] <type> Hi. I have a .js file (generated from some bytecode) that is executed properly when called with node. However, when I import functions of this file in my ReactJS application, "npm start" does not succeed. The errors apparently arise from babel transpilation step. I tried to exclude the file from babel transpilation using config files, but this does not change anything. My current guess is that when calling this file with both "import" or "requir
[17:40:45] <type> ed", the transpilation step will occur regardless of where the file is located. Is there any way I can make this work?

[21:49:44] <blueagain> blahboybaz: I would advise you not to get into type coercion in JavaScript. It is not intuitive. Use the strict comparison operators instead,  === and !==
[21:51:40] <blahboybaz> blueagain: I hadn't really considered that aspect. I suppose I was thinking more about how these things evaluate (results of comparrison) being useful in various ways
[21:52:49] <blahboybaz> For example, if an empty array evaluates to false when compared with true then maybe you can use that to check if an array is empty or not?
[21:53:01] <blahboybaz> idk
[21:53:21] <blueagain> blahboybaz: that makes no sense, we have a standardised way to do that, array.length === 0
[21:53:54] <blueagain> using type coercion to do such things will likely cause more confusion than do anything else

[23:37:31] <sheetjs> https://github.com/SheetJS/sheetjs/blob/master/bits/20_jsutils.js#L160 still working on this
[23:37:56] <sheetjs> there are about 11 formats that Excel 2019 interprets as dates, and about 11 formats that Chrome does not interpret as dates
[23:38:22] <qswz> if(s.match(/[^-0-9:,\/\\]/)) return n; → if(/[^-0-9:,\/\\]/.test(s)) return n;
[23:38:50] <qswz> clearer to me
[23:39:10] <qswz> can't help for the logic tho
[23:39:50] <sheetjs> tried writing a big regex for all of the accepted date formats
[23:39:55] <sheetjs> came out to ~5000 characters

[23:45:08] <qswz> look for fuzzy testing
[23:45:16] <sheetjs> IE10 had more exacting standards than Chrome
[23:45:35] <sheetjs> so the function takes a string and tries to determine if it's a real Date
[23:45:35] <blahboybaz> I guess I mean specifically the second ("b") in the function call - where is it going and what do you call what is happening?
[23:45:55] <blahboybaz> sorry sheets I was looking for an opening but I should have just waited from the start
[23:46:13] <sheetjs> blahboybaz: its a function
[23:46:39] <sheetjs> myFunc("a")("b") is actually two function calls: var __intermediate = myfunc("a"); __intermediate("b")
[23:46:47] <blueagain> blahboybaz: you're calling myFunc with "a" as its first parameter, and then calling myFunc's return value with "b"
[23:47:03] <blueagain> is myFunc doesn't return a function, you'd get a TypeError

[23:48:03] <blahboybaz> I'm getting an error in the paste site I use but the challenge itself clearly expects that to execute - in fact there are two test cases where they call the function like that
[23:48:27] <blueagain> this kind of style is called currying
[23:48:27] <blahboybaz> I don't even know how to sort out what is going on with those test cases
[23:48:44] <sheetjs> so blueagain there are different approaches to the problem, but the easiest is to brute-force to determine which types of date expressions are accepted
[23:48:57] <blahboybaz> I have seen currying before but I didn't recognize it in this
[23:49:04] <blahboybaz> thanks
[23:49:27] <blueagain> sheetjs: so basically just a use switch-like construct?
[23:49:31] <blueagain> s/use/hugh
[23:49:34] <blueagain> er, huge
[23:49:47] <sheetjs> or a single massive regex
[23:50:25] <sheetjs> javascript really should adopt coffeescript heregexes (heregices?)
[23:50:55] <sheetjs> coffeescript has a neat multi-line regular expression literal called "heregex", motivated by perl /x mode

[23:52:44] <sheetjs> makes it easier to write and comment
[23:53:34] <blueagain> sheetjs: btw, can't you delegate the parse to momentjs? or would it immeasureably increase your bundle size and potentially not get the job done appropriately?
[23:54:23] <sheetjs> moment requires you to know the format ahead of time
[23:54:48] <sheetjs> moment("2022-03-22", "YYYY-MM-DD")
[23:55:34] <sheetjs> and if you don't specify it, it tries ISO8601 before using the Date constructor
[23:55:43] <sheetjs> so the same problem persists :(
[23:57:06] <sheetjs> so the workaround that checks for month names is "ok".  it's not great but it addresses a large class of errors in a short snippet
[23:57:11] <blueagain> oh, I thought of it more like php's strtotime
[23:58:11] <sheetjs> like php date_parse? V8's date parser is simplistic by comparison
[23:59:10] <sheetjs> its a constant battle between utility and code size.  like how far are we allowed to advance the state of the art before google finds another way to take us down a notch?

[23:59:15] <blueagain> php's strtotime's definition reads "Parse about any English textual datetime description into a Unix timestamp"
[23:59:24] <blueagain> I thought you were deal with that kind of madness
[23:59:27] <blueagain> dealing*
[23:59:57] <sheetjs> its closer to date_parse than strtotime
