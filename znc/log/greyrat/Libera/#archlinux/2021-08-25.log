[01:27:29] <karrq> hello guys, does anybody know how to make a LUKS encrypted partition compression friendly? I'm trying to backup my drive and I know that the actual utilization of this 700 GB partition is <50% so I'd like to save some space in the backup file... I tried enabling trim on LUKS _and_ LVM but I'm still not compressing at the expected rate (using zstd --long I'm getting 98% compression rate) 
[01:28:31] <karrq> I really don't mind any security implication of doing this since it's temporary as I might have to restore my drive after sending my laptop to RMA
[01:29:01] <karrq> so, in normal use or after restore I wouldn't be using trim or anything of the sorts
[01:30:11] *** Joins: srv (~cmd@user/srv)
[01:30:27] <Namarrgon> so this is for a backup?
[01:31:06] <karrq> precisely, and a temporary one actually
[01:31:26] <Namarrgon> how much space do you have and how much data do you need to write to it?
[01:31:30] <karrq> I wouldn't even bother compressing if the drive I'm storing the backup on is big enough, but that is not the case

[01:32:33] <Namarrgon> encrypt the target if you must and then just tar the data
[01:33:06] <karrq> there's a couple of tiny partitions in the source drive, with a 200G microsoft bitlocker ntfs partition, a 19,5G recovery windows partition, and the 733,2G LUKS partition

[04:25:32] <rabbitnightmare> NetSysFire how so? I prefer having all my applications be current version
[04:25:47] <alschaapman> I can't really recommend that you actually use that, though. You're just asking for partial upgrades

[04:27:13] <rabbitnightmare> I like dolphin anyhow
[04:27:25] <alschaapman> The best way for you to receive upgrades from the official repos is `pacman -Syu`. End of story

[08:25:39] <kevr> or transfer it over from another computer and install it manually, but the iso way is probably the most straight forward
[08:25:46] <nergar> yup, had to do that
[08:26:01] <kevr> after you do that, iwd is installed

[08:26:54] <phrik> nergar: Iwd - https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Iwd
[08:26:57] <kevr> you do need to setup your interface in some way, yes. systemd-networkd is a popular method, one can also just use dhclient or dhcpcd after you're associated
[08:27:03] <kevr> iwd will associate you with an IP
[08:27:13] <kevr> after that, you can deal with it with `ip` or whatever
[08:27:23] <nergar> on the new install, because iwctl station device connect SSID allowed me to ping google, but now it says temporary failure in name resolution
[08:27:29] <kevr> iwd will associate you with an AP* not ip

[13:50:10] <torwag> Hi, I face some funny challenge with my network settings. I use systemd-resolve as described in the wiki. If I test with resolvectl query <address> I get names resolved within ms. If I try to access the very same address in the browser (firefox or chromium), it takes 10-15 sec and often times out.
[13:51:50] <torwag> This only happens on a wired interface in my organisation, on wifi it is fine as well as on my homenetwork. Does someone know how to investigate this further or does this ring some bells.
[13:54:07] <torwag> I use the networkmanager infrastructure to configure my networks. The IT-admin guys asked me to enter DNS addresses as well as try to get them via DHCP.... however, it seems not to work.
[13:56:42] <torwag> Just for my understanding, if I set a DNS server in the NetworkManager configs, it still relies on the dns caching of systemd-resolv? In /etc/resolv.conf points to the nameserver 127.0.0.53 via the wiki-mentioned symlink.  
[13:57:02] <Namarrgon> why are you using both at the same time?
[13:57:26] <torwag> Hey Namarrgon, what you mean by using both the same time

[14:25:23] *** Quits: chap (~chap@host-87-8-188-57.retail.telecomitalia.it) (Quit: I laugh with many, but don't trust any.)
[14:26:38] <Nixola> the issue is that the usbhid mousepoll kernel option doesn't appear to work, I have no usb 2.0 plugs on my system and I'd rather not disable USB 3 entirely just to try and get this mouse to stick to its advertised 125Hz polling rate

[14:27:47] <phrik> discord is not IRC, and IRC users likely don't care about it. Either way, it's not an official support channel.

[14:37:16] <alerque> _ak_: Any time it's been a while since you ran `pacman -Syu` it's a good idea to update the keyring by itself first, any updates to packages you install in the batch will not benefit from the keyring update as part of the same batch.

[14:40:04] <torwag> Just out of curiosity as this "keyring update first"-thingy seems to hit everyone from time to time. Is there any reason, why pacman could not do this automatically (installing the keyrings first), or propose to do this as an error-message resolution. 
[14:40:13] <alerque> weltio: There is a whole family of tools for watching sites for changes, some more suited to ones with good APIs and stable links, others more suited for scraping bits of data.

[16:24:57] <DeathOfASalesman> And used this page to set up a configuration file: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GRUB#Generate_the_main_configuration_file

[16:25:04] <deltasquared> Hello71: that page is entirely unhelpful. like I said, googling has not been forthcoming.

[16:25:10] <Hello71> what grub-install command did you run
[16:26:01] <Hello71> deltasquared: well standard alsa-lib doesn't come with a "usbstream" device
[16:26:12] <Hello71> https://github.com/alsa-project/alsa-plugins/blob/master/usb_stream/98-usb-stream.conf
[16:26:39] <DeathOfASalesman> The command is as follows: "grub-install --target=i386-pc /dev/sdb"
[16:26:56] <DeathOfASalesman> Note: sdb is my HDD, not the SSD.

[16:28:01] <DeathOfASalesman> However I do see one potential error - it says on the wiki that "The default file path is /boot/grub/grub.cfg, not /boot/grub/i386-pc/grub.cfg". I was not particularly sure of what this meant and had nowhere to ask, so I simply installed it to the default path - I assume this is in error?
[16:28:03] <deltasquared> Hello71: I found that file on my system. it just raises more questions, like... if that's the only thing that produces that description string, why the heck is it applying to cards that it would seem it has nothing to do with...

[16:28:58] <DeathOfASalesman> Pardon? 
[16:29:05] <DeathOfASalesman> Oh! I assume the HDD must be higher in the boot order?
[16:29:29] <Hello71> that sounds like a good idea
[16:29:29] <DeathOfASalesman> Well that should be an easy fix. Give me a few minutes.

[22:13:09] <grazzolini> nl6720: I need to start using systemd enabled initramfs on more places. right now I have it only on one machine
[22:14:04] <nl6720> I'm of the opinion that non-systemd based initamfs should be deprecated
[22:14:27] <andreas303> grazzolini: I have used the debug-shell that comes with mkinitcpio-systemd-tool poking around to gain some understanding. My setup is a ramdisk based on mkinitcpio-systemd-tool (I like that concept), with wpa_supplicant and dropbear. It actually works with the dirty hack of preprending wpa_supplicant with "sleep 5", but now I also want to add a custom service "duckdns.service" that updates the
[22:14:29] <andreas303> duckdns-record when the remote computer gets allocated a new public ip address by invoking curl on www.duckdns.org, and I want to put duckdns.service in the ramdisk so that I can always access the remote computer by its domain name instead of a possibly changing public ip address. The problem is that duckdns.service fails because it seems to start before systemd-networkd, systemd-resolved and
[22:14:31] <andreas303> wpa_supplicant even though I specify Requires= and After= in duckdns.service, so curl can't lookup the domain name. I thought that my solution to this problem was to understand the ordering of systemd units in the ramdisk, clean up the dirty "sleep 5"-hack for wpa_supplicant and then figure out how, and on which dependencies, to include in the duckdns.service so that it waits for all of
[22:14:33] <andreas303> systemd-networkd, systemd-resolved and wpa_supplicant before duckdns.service starts.
[22:15:50] <grazzolini> andreas303: I used to use this kind of service, but I switched to using tor hidden service for this. I even have a hook on the AUR for that.
[22:16:51] <andreas303> There is a thread about my problem here, https://github.com/random-archer/mkinitcpio-systemd-tool/issues/27, but it still seems to rely on the hack "sleep 5" without proper systemd ordering.

[23:44:36] <MrElendig> except stellaris, it works fine
[23:45:02] <MrElendig> got both flatpack and windows as a workaround though
[23:45:50] <grazzolini> MrElendig: I see. I hope that, with steam deck, they change the steam-runtime
[23:46:02] <grazzolini> because it's really old and sucky atm
[23:46:06] *** Joins: Crescendo (~Crescendo@user/crescendo)
[23:46:24] <MrElendig> indeed, it also trashes performance in some games due to being so old
[23:47:11] <gendish> i've read something about steam deck is using arch linux. true?
[23:47:16] <MrElendig> yes
[23:47:32] <MrElendig> well, kinda, its a custom distro loosely based on arch
[23:47:41] *** Quits: cmc (~methos@gateway/tor-sasl/cmc) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:47:55] <MrElendig> don't expect them to just use the arch repos directly :p
[23:48:07] <gendish> ah ok

[23:50:25] <grazzolini> MrElendig: from what I know so far (can be wrong), it uses their repo for a few things + ours
[23:50:35] <grazzolini> so, it should be pretty close to Arch
[23:50:48] <grazzolini> I guess we'll know more when they open source their stuff
[23:51:03] *** Joins: kibybyte (~kibybyte@223.191.49.157)
[23:51:14] <MrElendig> I expect them to run their own repo/mirror to avoid arch bricking every steamdeck by accident

[23:51:31] <grazzolini> MrElendig: their mirror on top of ours, yes
[23:51:42] <grazzolini> for crucial stuff probably, like kernels, etc
[23:52:01] <grazzolini> MrElendig: but, it'll have an A/B upgrade system for the images, which makes it easy to recover

[23:52:25] *** tehrig4 is now known as tehrig
[23:52:33] <grazzolini> MrElendig: having said that, even if they don't use our repos, you can install Arch on it anyway
