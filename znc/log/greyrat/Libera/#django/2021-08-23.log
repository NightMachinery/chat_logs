[05:26:29] <dre> guys is there a way I can connect to a read-only db, and then perform actions, and direct those '.save()' calls to a local sqlite or in-memory db ?
[05:27:29] <dre> I'm trying to debug a certain thing, but to get to that point where the error is, I'll have to make some changes to the database; ( ie: it happens in the middle of a transaction.atomic or etc)
[05:28:12] <dre> connecting to a read-only db doesn't allow me to write to the db obviously
[05:28:57] <dre> something like this perhaps? https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/db/multi-db/#using-routers
[05:33:55] *** Joins: cmbengue (~Thunderbi@207.191.249.160)

[05:48:35] <PaulWay[w]> Then declare one database read-only and one writable.
[05:48:47] <PaulWay[w]> Then Django automatically works out which database to apply the query to.
[05:49:01] <dre> yeah that's cool. Django is great
[05:49:48] <PaulWay[w]> Every time I come up against some problem in working with Django, and I find myself thinking "surely I'm not the only person to have this problem" - Django almost always has the solution built in.

[10:59:24] <Yaser_Amiri> serafeim: usually after one year of developement and increasing features, this happens (to me), I know it's solvable by passing Models name in FK as string or tricks like that but I don't like it! I have to restrucre apps and do a big refactor! anyway, thank you for the response.

[11:00:16] <serafeim> Yaser_Amiri: using model name as string in the foreign key is not a trick.
[11:00:24] <serafeim> it's what you should do :)
[11:01:23] <serafeim> i have to confess that when i was a new django user i also had problems with cyclic dependencies. but after some years you learn to avoid them

[14:20:38] <duoi> mad_moses never used that as a concept, but i imagine it cant be that hard as long as youre capturing the request headers and pumping them out to google
[14:25:51] <mad_moses> duoi: you just need to store the GCLID on server side and send it to google if a conversion happend
[14:26:01] <mad_moses> https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/guides/conversion-tracking#importing_click_conversions
[14:27:04] <duoi> mad_moses even easier
[14:27:55] <mad_moses> I just wrote my own middleware which stores the GCLID id in a session. Once a conversion happend, i check if there is a GCLID id in my session and send it to google. (Not tested yet)
[14:28:43] <duoi> sounds straight forward enough, good work

[21:27:15] <djacobs> Apart from the compiler error, i dont see why it even needs to compile
[21:29:07] <dodo> i have honestly no idea... could be a packaging bug? maybe try a previous release?
[21:29:40] <djacobs> for the psycopg2-binary package?
[21:29:53] <dodo> yeah, though i also use 2.9.1 and it's fine

[21:30:28] <dodo> i don't even have a compiler in my image and it works. let me just build and check the output..
[21:30:32] <djacobs> I'm gonna try once more by adding python3-dev as a to install package
[21:30:43] <djacobs> if that doesn't work i will try the django-image :d

[21:32:07] <dodo> yeah, no wheel build for me
[21:32:13] <knbk> you could try installing with --only-binary=psycopg2-binary, if anything it might say why it won't install from wheel?
