[08:13:33] <ButterNoodle> naa
[08:13:41] <MootPoot> I live in a 4 story house

[08:15:43] <MootPoot> 50mbps lol
[08:15:47] <ButterNoodle> lol
[08:15:52] <ButterNoodle> low latency tho
[08:15:54] <ButterNoodle> :|

[10:23:15] <amigojapan> MootPoot: why are we accepting planned obsolescence?
[10:23:30] <MootPoot> I have a few trash SMR drives as backup, but they're too slow to use as a live drive
[10:23:50] <MootPoot> so plan is to use this for network reads and writes and keep the reading and writing minimal on the SMRs

[10:59:50] <amigojapan> MootPoot: 10 years is a short time
[11:00:17] <MootPoot> Based on who's lifespan? Average Africans? Japanese? 
[11:00:41] <amigojapan> MootPoot: you will understand when you are 40
[11:00:52] <MootPoot> Again, who's lifespan? 
[11:01:05] <PancakeMatsuri> I think 10 years is a long time
[11:01:16] <MootPoot> So Japanese or european people who live longer should have phones that last 20 years 
[11:01:27] <amigojapan> PancakeMatsuri: how old are you?
[11:01:29] <MootPoot> But Africans and middle Eastern have then at 15

[11:03:09] <PancakeMatsuri> a lot of things happened
[11:03:16] <amigojapan> You need at least 20 years to say it is "a long time
[11:03:18] <MootPoot> Also, the meaning of time is relative 
[11:03:43] <MootPoot> If 20 years is nothing to you, that just means you didn't do shit for 20 years

[11:05:19] <MootPoot> job changes, new things, new people etc
[11:05:45] <MootPoot> but anyway, 20 years is a short time to you just because you think 20 years is worthless
[11:06:01] <MootPoot> 20 years is a massive amount of time for the rest of us, old or young
[11:06:45] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I said 20 years is what I consider a long time. Why are you making up what I say
[11:07:05] <amigojapan> But not 10
[11:07:06] <MootPoot> you can change it to any number of years really

[11:07:18] <MootPoot> 2,5,10,15, whatever you want
[11:07:28] <MootPoot> the significance of any amount of time is relative 
[11:08:02] <PancakeMatsuri> When I was ~23 an older woman said "I'll live in [city] for a couple of years", and it seemed weird. It's not weird anymore.
[11:08:14] <amigojapan> MootPoot: it changes when you age too
[11:08:19] <MootPoot> to an animal that lives 200+ years your 20 years that you consider a long time is a joke
[11:08:58] <MootPoot> back on topic, my entire point is, basing how long things should last based on arbitrary metrics is a fools errand
[11:09:04] <amigojapan> MootPoot: we live 100 years
[11:09:15] <MootPoot> no, we dont
[11:09:23] <MootPoot> the vast majority of humans die before 100
[11:09:37] <amigojapan> Yeah but not by much
[11:09:51] <amigojapan> 80 is probably average
[11:10:31] <MootPoot> If you said instead "I think phones should last 10 years because I think thats the maximum time we can make hardware that wont fail" makes more sense then some arbitary tying to something unrelated
[11:10:36] <amigojapan> That is 4 periods of 20 years
[11:11:50] <amigojapan> And 8 periods of 10 years
[11:12:20] <MootPoot> yes, but why is that relavant
[11:13:07] <amigojapan> I am now discussing what is "a long time"
[11:13:33] <amigojapan> Obviously we should want our electronics to let a long time
[11:13:41] <MootPoot> I'm asking you, what does an arbitrary definition of "a long time" have to do with how long electronics should last
[11:13:45] <amigojapan> Last but let
[11:13:51] <MootPoot> if I say 5 min is a long time, should they last that long?
[11:14:14] <MootPoot> what I'm saying is that "a long time" is a subjective and useless metric
[11:14:27] <amigojapan> Ok
[11:15:05] <MootPoot> if you want to say phones should last 20 years because we can make them last that long by doing X, Y and Z properly, I would agree with that
[11:15:15] <MootPoot> since thats actually related to the phone
[11:15:58] <amigojapan> MootPoot: the only components your should need to change ever are the battery and the screen
[11:16:41] <amigojapan> They are the degradable components
[11:17:02] <MootPoot> eh...on a time scale of 20 years everything is degradable
[11:17:08] <MootPoot> phones dont self-repair or heal
[11:17:45] <MootPoot> the circuit boards will break connections due to heat and cooling, capacitors are typically rated for a max of like 10 years, plastic wears away if humans touch it enough, etc
[11:18:22] <amigojapan> MootPoot: the only thing that forced me to upgrade after 7 years with a phone was forced updates making the apps not support me
[11:18:42] <amigojapan> The hardware still works
[11:18:50] <MootPoot> realistically I think the idea of making X thing last Y years is a bit bleh to me, I'd prefer if we had the goal of making X thing as repairable as possible instead
[11:18:51] <amigojapan> Even today
[11:20:01] <MootPoot> Since eventually If you replace enough parts you're in a ship of Theseus scenario 
[11:20:18] <MootPoot> At which point you might as well have bought a new phone since you've replaced so many parts 
[11:21:13] <MootPoot> But that's what the industry does anyway these days 
[11:21:37] <amigojapan> MootPoot: everything in a phone can last at least 7 years except for the battery
[11:22:25] <MootPoot> They buy equipment to last 10-15 years, repair it to keep going, but when the repairs become too hard it just makes more sense to upgrade since you'll be spending the same amount of time and effort and resources repairing as you will upgrading to a new one 
[11:22:34] <MootPoot> Like what they did with 2g
[11:23:14] <MootPoot> They wait till 99.9% of people don't use it anymore since their phones that use 2g won't work, then they just upgrade 
[11:23:35] <MootPoot> amigojapan: Hmm.....I would say at least 4 years from my experience
[11:24:02] <MootPoot> Most phones I have that I didn't sell after 3 years or 4 just stopped working after that long
[11:24:08] <amigojapan> Then how do you explain the phone I used for 7 years MootPoot 
[11:24:21] <MootPoot> amigojapan: statistical anomaly 
[11:24:30] <amigojapan> HMmm
[11:24:44] <MootPoot> Most other phones I've seen at used shops are also really banged up after 3-4 years 
[11:25:45] <amigojapan> MootPoot: even if that were the case. Modular phones could extend the life
[11:26:07] <amigojapan> One module brakes, replace that
[11:26:57] <MootPoot> absolutely
[11:26:59] <amigojapan> One module becomes obsolete, replace it
[11:27:07] <MootPoot> I have no issue with making phones repariable or upgradable
[11:27:11] <MootPoot> I actually like that idea
[11:27:16] <amigojapan> Ok
[11:27:23] <MootPoot> I'm just against tyiing how long things should last to arbitrary numbers
[11:27:38] <amigojapan> Ok
[11:28:51] <MootPoot> because the way that you end up achiving stupid metrics is by doing stupid things
[11:29:03] <MootPoot> like if you actually mandated that phones are to last 20 years in law, for example
[11:29:17] <MootPoot> everyone would just replace enough parts that they could have bought a new phone anyways
[11:29:29] <MootPoot> and you wouldnt have reduced resource usage at all
[11:29:44] <MootPoot> everyone would just replace all the core modules every 3 years, or even less then that
[11:30:46] <amigojapan> But the very idea of modular phones never seems to have crystallized
[11:31:00] <MootPoot> the closest we got was that google project
[11:31:17] <MootPoot> I think the main problem is that phones are just too small for proper standardization
[11:32:25] <beaky> gotta standardize on emoji

[14:23:48] <amigojapan> Yeah DunceCotus but we could not lose weight easily. Nothing worked cause we are eating carbs
[14:24:03] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: we weren't so obese then though
[14:24:09] <DunceCotus> obesity problems seems fairly new
[14:24:26] <DunceCotus> same with allergies
[14:24:30] <DunceCotus> I think its interconnected
[14:24:40] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: there were morbidly obese people 10 years ago
[14:24:48] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: well sure
[14:25:03] <DunceCotus> perhaps when I say 10 years i'm under-exaggerating

[14:33:08] <amigojapan> Yup
[14:34:41] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I don't think it is the ketogenic portion of the diet that works. I think it's actually just reducing carbs and sugars to almost nothing that works
[14:35:14] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: yeah probably
[14:35:32] <DunceCotus> a lot of dieting fads are really only efficacious cause they reduce carbs and sugars

[15:05:01] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: there could be other reasons than curvature for that to happen
[15:06:13] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: but the most likely is the curvature of the earth
[15:06:58] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: no not necessarily
[15:07:56] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: that is what Aristotle thought
[15:08:31] <DunceCotus> Aristotle thought a lot of things
[15:08:58] <amigojapan> That is true, he also thought slavery was ok
[15:10:07] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: the fact remains that nomatter what experiment we do, you guys won't change your mind
[15:10:42] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: won't we?
[15:11:39] <amigojapan> Nope DunceCotus you are set in your ways
[15:11:54] <DunceCotus> am I?
[15:12:01] <amigojapan> Yes
[15:12:15] <DunceCotus> hmm
[15:12:38] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I admit that video does seem to imply horizon drop-off
[15:12:50] <DunceCotus> but curvature may not be best explanation for it
[15:12:56] <amigojapan> Ok
[15:13:03] <amigojapan> Why not
[15:13:40] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: there's also experiments done by flat earthers that show buildings and structures from distances where they shouldn't be visible based on the heliocentrists' equations
[15:14:32] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: if since honestly anyone should get the same results
[15:15:31] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I don't think nature works like that tbh
[15:16:51] <DunceCotus> in a way flat earthers and globers are two sides of same coin
[15:17:10] <DunceCotus> they think they can get a fix on nature
[15:17:13] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: if the earth was flat, then the ship should just get infinitely smaller
[15:17:18] <DunceCotus> like nature works like X or it works like Y
[15:17:23] <DunceCotus> the reality is it is both and neither
[15:18:13] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: no not necessarily
[15:18:27] <DunceCotus> depends on the nature of a flat earth
[15:18:34] <DunceCotus> or maybe its some other shape
[15:18:37] <DunceCotus> not globe, not flat
[15:19:21] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: that is just silly
[15:20:47] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: any curvature at all means it's not parallel and the lines increasect at some point, assuming the curvature continues
[15:21:34] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: the Earth is a lumpy patchwork
[15:21:53] <amigojapan> No water is actually flat
[15:22:05] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: but ultimately its more of an infinite plane imo than a globe
[15:22:11] <amigojapan> It does have waves but not hills
[15:22:15] <DunceCotus> encapsulated by a bubble/cell wall
[15:22:30] <DunceCotus> water isn't flat.
[15:22:57] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: well that goes against the evidence shown in the experiment
[15:23:34] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: in that very same experiment you can see the water bulge
[15:24:04] <amigojapan> The bulge is the curve of earth
[15:24:14] <DunceCotus> nope
[15:24:26] <DunceCotus> its an affect of scale
[15:25:36] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: notice how behind the target is visible
[15:25:48] <DunceCotus> that's cause a 'hill' of water is obscuring the lower stripe
[15:26:09] <DunceCotus> if it were curvature the water level to that lower stripe shouldn't be visible either
[15:26:21] <DunceCotus> like behind the target
[15:26:24] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: you need to demonstrate "hills of water exist
[15:26:45] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I think that video does a good job of that
[15:27:53] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: go por water in a glass and find me a hill in the surface
[15:28:09] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: it doesn't happen at those scales (or its not visible)
[15:28:57] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: it does but happen in satellite images either, but if course you think they are fake
[15:30:13] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: if satellite images are fake, did they take the images for Google maps from airplanes? And why don't they show water hills?
[15:30:43] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: satellite images aren't fake

[15:37:24] <amigojapan> Arcorann: they seem complex, we need more simple proofs like the one with the boat going out into the water
[15:39:42] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: also if there were high hills of water, you could measure it in an altimeter
[15:40:05] <DunceCotus> its worth noting there's a lot more people 'defending' globe earth than there are people putting forward flat earth arguments
[15:40:17] <DunceCotus> like a lot of people going on about how silly flat earth is
[15:40:30] <amigojapan> They is true
[15:40:37] <MootPoot> the earth is flat
[15:40:41] <amigojapan> As of now DunceCotus 
[15:40:41] <MootPoot> how do you explain 2d anime
[15:40:42] <DunceCotus> search for flat earth on youtube and you are greeted with a snippet of the wikipedia article saying flat earth is an archaic conception of earth etc.
[15:40:55] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: truth is not a democracy
[15:41:02] <DunceCotus> they're trying to beat over our head that its a globe
[15:41:12] <DunceCotus> It's a globe.. just AGREE
[15:41:16] <MootPoot> lol
[15:41:31] <MootPoot> its a pointless argument imo
[15:41:49] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: the truth doesn't need to be beaten into us
[15:41:57] <DunceCotus> that smacks of 'truth'
[15:42:00] <MootPoot> sure, now you believe its a cylinder, flat or round...and that does what exactly
[15:42:09] <MootPoot> it dosen't really change anything for 99.99% of people
[15:42:29] <DunceCotus> MootPoot: it could change a lot actually
[15:42:33] <MootPoot> like what
[15:42:40] <DunceCotus> as it may imply other Earths are very very close (relatively)
[15:42:52] <MootPoot> say we take for example amigojapan, lets say he now believes that the earth is flat
[15:42:57] <DunceCotus> and we're not in some infinite void with barely any matter
[15:42:58] <MootPoot> what changes in his life
[15:43:00] <DunceCotus> but most of the universe is matter
[15:43:00] <MootPoot> nothing
[15:43:01] <DunceCotus> etc.
[15:43:07] <DunceCotus> MootPoot: it would change a lot
[15:43:13] <MootPoot> again, change what
[15:43:19] <DunceCotus> MootPoot: science would have to change, as a whole
[15:43:27] <MootPoot> in his "life"

[15:46:08] <MootPoot> why
[15:46:11] <DunceCotus> this is what sets limits
[15:46:18] <MootPoot> it does nothing for your daily life

[15:46:55] <MootPoot> you would walk the same, talk the same
[15:47:00] <DunceCotus> suddenly ground takes on new context
[15:47:07] <MootPoot> why do you care about the context?
[15:47:11] <DunceCotus> nature cares.
[15:47:14] <MootPoot> the only context you need to know about is yourself
[15:47:16] <DunceCotus> nature is not inert

[15:49:23] <DunceCotus> this is perhaps the motor for evolution
[15:49:31] <amigojapan> That he is and he admits it MootPoot 
[15:49:41] <MootPoot> so every time something dies all of nature goes "oh shit, this X died, we gotta stop EVERYTHING and restart"
[15:49:48] <DunceCotus> MootPoot: yup
[15:49:56] <DunceCotus> as you can imagine nature is continually restarting
[15:49:57] <MootPoot> so nature is restarting all the time then
[15:50:05] <MootPoot> then why does it matter
[15:50:14] <MootPoot> if the normal state is constantly restarting
[15:50:14] <DunceCotus> MootPoot: because its literally matter
[15:50:29] <DunceCotus> MootPoot: ah but that's where conceptualising comes in
[15:50:37] <MootPoot> you mean acid
[15:50:39] <DunceCotus> this interfaces with how nature restarts
[15:50:59] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I wish nature would have restarted before my parents died then, it when they did
[15:51:28] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: death is hard for us moderns

[15:55:06] <MootPoot> in most 5g deployments these days until the backbone comes up, its basically the same speed
[15:55:33] <MootPoot> amigojapan:  the way to do that is by adding like dozens of 5g antennas all over the place

[18:12:20] <omero> uhm... not so sure, Urchin[emacs] ... but I can stand to be corrected
[18:12:43] <DunceCotus> omero: "It's a common misconception that Eratosthenes was measuring the circumference of the round earth in his shadow experiment. Eratosthenes had simply assumed that the earth was a sphere in his experiment, based on the work of Aristotle. He was actually measuring the diameter of the flat earth (distance across), which is a figure identical to the circumference of the round earth (distance around).
[18:12:44] <DunceCotus> We can use Eratosthenes' shadow experiment to determine the diameter of the flat earth."
