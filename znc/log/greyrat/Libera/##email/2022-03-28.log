[01:32:52] <foo> Habbie: bah, apparently - with this set up - gmail put the mail in spam for 1 person 
[01:51:35] <foo> Bah, I've spent several days trying to get something out trying to get something out in production on an email campaign. I just did a test with someone on our team and... the email is A) going to spam, B) if it's not in spam it goes to promotions, and C) the "from" address in outlook says:name=aglconstruct.com@mailgun.domain.tld on behalf of First Last name@domain.tld   ... meh, been working 14 hour days, 
[01:51:41] <foo> really thought I would be done on this. In case anyone has any insights let me know, I have email headers and can see SPF and DKIM PASS in Gmail (spam in Gmail) 
[01:59:07] <lunaphyte> if you share a pastebin of an entire sample message, someone may be able to offer suggestions or guidance
[02:00:17] <foo> lunaphyte: yes, agree - doing that now. 
[02:00:35] <foo> I almost wonder if the mailgun tracking links are causing this
[02:07:41] <foo> lunaphyte: https://bpa.st/XBHA
[02:07:52] <foo> The backup option is I send the mail through Outlook's SMTP

[14:54:37] <Habbie> i run a mailinglist; it does not strip DKIM signatures, but does rewrite a few headers; thus, final receivers mark the signature as invalid
[14:54:49] <Habbie> question: would stripping the DKIM signatures make the spambox situation better, or worse?
[14:54:55] *** Joins: labrador_ (~labrador@user/labrador)
[14:56:31] <pj> You're better bet is to avoid rewriting certain key headers that are common / recommended for DKIM.
[14:57:07] <Habbie> sure, but that's not one of my options
[14:57:37] <pj> but I think if you simply add your own DKIM signature then you won't likely have to remove the others, but I can't say that for sure, anti-spam of major ESPs is a black box.
[14:57:51] <Habbie> definitely a black box
[14:58:02] <Habbie> i also did not have plans to start signing DKIM, or at least not on very short term
[14:58:15] *** Quits: labrador (~labrador@user/labrador) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[14:58:36] <pj> so the safest thing is to check the existing signature against the headers that you modify, and if you determine it invalidates then remove the sig, you can add your sign in either case.
[14:58:55] <Habbie> ack
[14:58:57] *** Quits: labrador_ (~labrador@user/labrador) (Client Quit)
[14:59:14] <pj> well, if you don't have a valid dkim sig then you're likely also invalidating DMARC (although you are probably doing that anyways).
[14:59:56] <Habbie> mailman rewrites From: to be from my domain, so dmarc should not be a problem - i think, i'm no expert
[15:00:29] <pj> right, but you still will want a dkim sig to match the domain in order to help with that.
[15:01:03] <pj> DMARC requires either a valid SPF or DKIM sig to match the From: domain, but if you can have both it's even better.
[15:01:12] <Habbie> ack
[15:02:54] <pj> so yeah, you want to rewrite the envelope sender either way (which you are almost certainly doing for bounce-handling purposes) and have a valid SPF record on that domain.  And then you either way to leave the From:, Subject, body and a few key other headers intact so as not to invalidate the original DKIM sig or you need to rewrite the From: and sign it yourself.
[15:14:52] <Habbie> we started rewriting From a few years ago and it reduced complaint volume a lot
[15:14:54] <Habbie> agreed on the rest too
[15:14:56] <Habbie> thanks!

[21:36:45] <rob0> hmm, I would expect that gmail would provide DMARC instructions for their hosting customers.

[21:38:07] <rob0> I guess you could configure SPF appropriately (with includes) and DMARC to only look at SPF.
[21:52:11] <nedbat> rob0: I have gmail configured to use ned@nedbat.com as the From address. that's what causes dmarc alignment to fail.
[21:53:14] <rob0> are they not hosting nedbat.com?
[21:57:41] <nedbat> rob0: No, it's not a full GWorkspace thing.  
[21:58:32] <nedbat> rob0: I have a simple gmail account, with the From address configured
[23:31:59] <lunaphyte> nedbat: so in other words, what you'd described as a "gmail-backed email domain" really isn't
[23:32:22] <lunaphyte> you just have a gmail address, and are sending via it, but using some other email address as the sender
[23:32:29] <nedbat> lunaphyte: yes
[23:33:28] <nedbat> lunaphyte: is there a way to make this work?
[23:35:00] <lunaphyte> while it would be best if your From: header matched your dkim signature, it isn't required for dmarc aligment
[23:35:17] <lunaphyte> *alignment
[23:36:11] <lunaphyte> what may matter though, is how exactly google sends the messages when you use your non gmail address
[23:37:11] <lunaphyte> i would suggest preparing a pastebin which contains an entire sample message send through google, using your non gmail email address as the sender
[23:37:33] <lunaphyte> then we can see what the behavior is, and what options you may [or may not] have
