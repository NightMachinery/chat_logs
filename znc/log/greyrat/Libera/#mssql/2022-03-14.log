[07:25:29] <alch3mist> hello all, I have an issue with mssql, I'm importing data into my tables, and I have this one column that's set to be DECIMAL(20,10) but I get a "Arithmetic overflow error converting numeric to data type numeric." if that column contains numbers larger than 100,000. I thought based on the definition this should take up to 9,999,999,999.9999999999.
[07:25:30] <alch3mist> any idea why?
[07:37:42] <joel1> alch3mist, do you know for sure which values are causing the error?
[07:39:42] <alch3mist> joel1, yes, i spent few hours and was able to single it out. I cut my import file in half and imported it and test it and each time it passed I cut the remainder in half and repeated until I found it. the value is exactly 100,121, and I changed it to 99,999 and it didn't give me an error, I then changed it to 100,000 and same error again
[07:40:35] <joel1> How are you importing these data values? Using SSIS?
[07:40:46] <alch3mist> and this is how I defined my column CAST(ISNULL(a.ETC,0) AS DECIMAL(20,10) )
[07:40:51] <alch3mist> I am actually using toad
[07:41:11] <alch3mist> it's an excel file that I import using toads import wizard
[07:41:43] <alch3mist> I've been doing this for a while and never an issue until this Friday when one of the values apparently updated to be more than 100k
[07:42:16] <joel1> how is a.ETC defined?
[07:43:32] <alch3mist> in the raw table that I import the file it's defined as navchar in this SP it then converts it to decimal (20,10)
[07:44:13] <joel1> I wonder if it's Toad's limitation
[07:46:32] <alch3mist> I actually just double checked and even tho in the SP I defined it as (20,10) I see in the table properties that it's numeric(10,5) and if that's the case that makes sense
[07:46:42] <alch3mist> since you asked I needed to double check
[07:46:52] <alch3mist> do you know why or what might have overwritten it?
[07:54:48] <joel1> That is definitely the case
[07:55:20] <joel1> 5 digits to the left of the decimal point is 99,999
[07:56:26] <alch3mist> correct, but I'm not sure how that could have been changed. I guess I need to update it again. but thanks for making me question the tables again. I guess I spent so much time trying to figure it out I was blind to this little detail
[07:56:54] <joel1> You may want to invest in a solution that monitors for configuration drift
[08:00:23] <alch3mist> can you elaborate a bit? I'm not sure if I'm too familiar
[08:00:55] <joel1> There are tools that let you do source control for database objects
[08:01:45] <joel1> I know of two vendors (other than Microsoft) and I'm using one of them
[08:02:15] <alch3mist> oh I see. that's neat. any suggestions? I'll definitely look into it. I am in the process of rewriting the whole import process since it's old and time consuming, but I'm doing it in python
[08:02:42] <alch3mist> I'd definitely like to see how your suggestion can help too
[08:02:46] <alch3mist> it's really smart
[08:03:11] <alch3mist> I have my own python code that checks for certain common errors in the data but I rather have a ready to use solution
[08:03:55] <joel1> https://www.red-gate.com/products/sql-development/sql-source-control/
[08:04:14] <joel1> this is the one I use
[08:04:53] <joel1> Here is the other vendor: https://www.apexsql.com/sql-tools-source-control.aspx
[08:05:08] <alch3mist> thank you so much I'm going to check them out.
[08:05:18] <joel1> You're welcome :-)
[08:05:34] <joel1> Do you support Oracle?
[08:05:55] <alch3mist> I really appreciate the help, I talked to you before on freenode and you're helpful on our previous interactions. thanks
[08:06:09] <joel1> You remembered me :-)
[08:06:49] <alch3mist> yeah you have a easy to remember name, I remember some of the names, but I don't spend too much time here anymore,
[08:07:10] <joel1> Well, I'm glad you've migrated to Libera.chat
[08:07:18] <alch3mist> but it's always good to check here first before taking my issues to stackoverflow
[08:07:32] <joel1> Good luck
[08:08:00] <alch3mist> hahaha thanks, me too
[08:08:03] <alch3mist> stay safe
[08:08:05] <alch3mist> cheers
[08:08:27] <joel1> Take care
