[00:03:05] <lowin> yup
[00:04:23] <EdePopede> i had this with my old deskjet. the paper feeder. turned out later they really had a problem with the rubber used on the roll. months later.
[00:07:04] <lowin> I had a similar issue with one of my own projects at work. A race condition that didn't occur when debugging messages were enabled, but triggered almost instantly without them. took well over a month to diagnose after rewriting almost a third of the project
[00:07:53] <tjcarter> sney: I have a 4 port Anker that seems to work and I trust Anker to be a little better made than the usual China import crap.
[00:08:53] <PerfDave> I've got a great TP-Link powered desktop USB hub
[00:08:55] <tjcarter> Anker is cheap and Chinese-made, but they understand the US market: Make it a little better and trade on your reputation for making it a little better and you'll make up the lost sales in repeat customers. It works, I approve.
[00:09:01] <n4dir> they don't produce in China? shocking news

[00:34:46] <ross`> I have a Dell Precision 7510 and I have this issue where I can install debian as I have many times before, but for some reason it can't boot grub. Meaning, it doesn't even get to grub, not that it gets to grub but it can't boot debian. I have this issue with UEFI and legacy BIOS. NVME and SSD. I can install / boot windows 10 just fine. I think the issue might be that it has a gpu which allows for switching
[00:34:52] <ross`> between intel cpu graphics and dedicated graphics with the AMD FirePro W1750M. Can someone help me out with some advice?
[00:35:21] <PerfDave> ross`: If it can't get to grub, what does it do instead? Just boots Windows?
[00:36:42] *** Quits: bloodninja (~bloodninj@user/bloodninja) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[00:36:55] <ross`> What's weird is that even if I force boot a partition that has debian installed on it then it doesn't boot, although it shows up as a UEFI boot option. It's very weird. Not sure what the issue is, but I'm guessing the gpu.
[00:37:31] <ross`> When I installed I started with the default partitioning scheme but then removed swap and made the root partition btrfs. I left the EFI partition alone.

[00:44:11] <tjcarter> PerfDave: the board does appear to be well-assembled. There's an insane amount of thermal or dilectric grease around one of the components but better than not enough

[00:46:00] <jkc> willow: resolved creates a service-managed resolv.conf file in /run/systemd/resolve. For resolved, the intent is to create a symlink at /etc/resolv.conf that points to either the resolv.conf file or the stub-resolv.conf file in that runtime directory.
[00:46:12] <ansgar> willow: Maybe the "/etc/resolv.conf" section in man:systemd-resolved(8) answers your questions.
[00:47:58] <tjcarter> I think the uplink connector, a tiny SMT job save for a couple through-hole pins to give it mechanical strength, is ever so slightly crooked in the board. Within manufacturing tolerance even on a well-made board … pick and place machines are only so accurate. But it's too much slop for the plastic housing.
[00:47:58] <willow> jkc: but /etc/resolv.conf isn't a symlink on any of the systems i enabled resolved on
[00:48:29] <tjcarter> yeah I can fix this by nipping out the plastic around it. And I think I will do so
[00:48:30] <jkc> willow: Because you didn't do that step yet.
[00:48:43] <willow> ansgar: thanks.  am also looking at /etc/systemd/resolvd.conf options now

[00:53:33] <willow> sometimes i think that separate systemd components like systemd-resolved should be separate debian packages so that each one could have it's own README.Debian in /usr/share/doc
[00:53:58] <jkc> willow: Why? There's nothing specific to those components in Debian. man systemd-* is just fine.
[00:54:42] <willow> oic there's actually a section on setting up the resolv.conf symlink in /usr/share/doc/system/README.Debian  ;-)

[06:16:16] <greycat> was it ever?  if so, you can use the tracker to see when/why it was removed.
[06:17:10] <n4dir> not sure, but if i search 'all suits' at packages.debian.org, ain't there. Thing is the front end qsampler is there (but useless, obviously, without linuxsampler).

[06:28:29] <n4dir> if it is the license, then linuxsampler won't be added (if license doesn't change), and ... well, qsampler is there and will probably stay too. Not up to me to "complain"
[06:29:43] <somiaj> yea, and it couldn't even be put into debian non-free without permission from the authors, either way, I see why it isn't in debian.

[12:47:19] <ross`> I have secure boot disabled in bios, but UEFI is enabled and I can confirm that the debian installer and sysrescd grub seem to work fine. Just not the grub that gets installed with debian.

[12:47:42] <ross`> I have a Dell Precision 7510. I also updated the bios to the latest version for good measure.
[12:48:38] <ross`> When I do an ls on /boot/efi/EFI it shows debian etc just like the options show up during the one time boot menu.
[12:49:00] <ross`> So the installer seems to be installing the entry correct. Grub just won't boot (doesn't get to grub at all)
[12:50:27] <ross`> If someone could give me some advice I would really really appreciate it. I think something especially weird is going on here that might not be my fault. My laptop is quite old now. I am using a newer WD 750 NVME drive, but windows boots fine.
[12:50:50] <ross`> Also, I can't get grub to boot from an ssd. This system ran Debian 100% fine for several years before this until I reinstalled.
[12:51:00] <ross`> er regular ssd.
[12:51:37] <ross`> I have the exact same windows 10 + debian configuration installed on my server and my desktop and grub boots just fine.
[12:52:06] <ross`> same partition ordering / sizes. No dedicated /boot partition. btrfs for / partition.
[12:52:16] <ross`> It's just this laptop that seems to be having issues

[13:01:50] <ross`> I think my UEFI bios might actually be bugged or something. Debian installer installs to UEFI just fine and adds the menu entry when I look at the one time boot menu. But it gives an error saying that the device can't boot and grub never actually shows up at all.
[13:02:29] <jelly> debian entry uses shimx64.efi as if the installer thought you had Secure Boot enabled
[13:02:45] <jelly> compare the entry for arch
[13:03:07] <ross`> yeah, so the arch entry is when grub-install worked from outside the chroot on the sysrescd
[13:03:24] <ross`> Both perform exactly the same though and fail to boot. I can try enabling secure boot though and see what that does.

[13:31:53] <ross`> jelly: WWOWOWWOWOOWWO It was a bug!!!
[13:32:35] <ross`> The installer set the path to \EFI\debian\grubx64.efi
[13:32:56] <ross`> If I go into my bios and manually change it to 'EFI\debian\grubx64.efi then it boots grub
[13:33:04] <ross`> The prepending \ broke it.
[13:33:18] <Khepra> the installer set that path where?
[13:33:28] <ross`> I'm not even sure who to report this bug to, who is more stubborn the vendor or grub / debian?
[13:34:03] <ross`> Khepra: https://base.im/~ross/pb/efi
[13:34:28] <ross`> Notice the UEFI: WD_BLACK SN750 SE 500GB, Partition 1 entry vs the debian or arch etc entries
[13:34:35] <Khepra> I don't understand. where is that set, and where did you change that?
[13:34:55] <ross`> It was set automatically, I manually updated it in the bios itself, removing that \ and it booted
[13:35:01] <ross`> https://www.dell.com/community/Inspiron/Dell-G5-15-5587-does-not-boot-GRUB-or-systemd-boot/td-p/7188704
[13:35:02] <Khepra> I'm not familiar with taht path being "set" anywhere by the installer. it simply creates the ESP, mounts it, creates EFI/debian dir and puts the stub kernel in it.
[13:35:09] <ross`> I found this which helped me look for the answer tehre
[13:35:12] <Khepra> ross`: that something about your bios, not something the installer did
[13:35:30] <ross`> Khepra: What I'm saying is the installer installed it to \EFI which the bios refused
[13:35:33] <ross`> This is a bug
[13:35:34] <Khepra> no
[13:35:38] <ross`> Yes
[13:35:41] <Khepra> there is no "\EFI" vs "EFI"
[13:35:45] <Khepra> ..
[13:35:45] <ross`> Yes there is.
[13:35:49] <Khepra> where?
[13:35:52] <Khepra> where is that stored?
[13:35:59] <jelly> Khepra, boot entries for efi are stored somewhere and shown with efibootmgr -v ; <ross`> https://base.im/~ross/pb/efi
[13:36:11] <ross`> Until I removed the \ from EFI manually in my bios it would not boot
[13:36:23] <Khepra> jelly: but where is that stored?
[13:36:42] <ross`> I never touched the entries (in fact didn't even know they existed in my bios) before I read that post of someone editing stuff manually that seemed to describe my issue

[13:37:27] <Khepra> right, so... that's something specific to that bios/firmware thingy. I mean, if I am wrong about this, my apologies, and I'd be happy to learn, but afaik there's nothing like this stored by the installer.. I mean, stored _where_
[13:37:49] <jelly> ross`, might be; are other entries as seen in bios also lacking the first \ ?
[13:38:08] <ross`> jelly: Correct, the only entries that have \ are from the debian installer and grub-install
[13:38:12] <ross`> everything else is missing the prepending \
[13:38:24] <jelly> Khepra, wherever efibootmgr reads from and writes to
[13:39:01] <jelly> ross`, then it might be a suboptimal setting that some firmware can work with and other cannot
[13:39:02] <ross`> The exact paths as efibootmgr were shown exactly that way in my bios and I was able to manually modify them to remove the prepending \
[13:39:11] <Khepra> efivars?
[13:39:26] <jelly> Khepra, where are those stored
[13:39:34] <Khepra> in the firmware itself
[13:39:43] <jelly> then there, I guess
[13:40:03] <Khepra> chip, flash, something something.... write it wrong and for buggy firmware you've bricked (literally, turned into paperweight) your system
[13:40:22] <Khepra> so this is efibootmgr bug then?
[13:40:35] <ross`> No, this is a Dell bug. I assume \EFI should be valid
[13:41:29] <jelly> if no other entries have that initial \ and that includes entries for other linux distros, then it might be both
[13:41:49] <jelly> sure a Dell bug, but if other distros work around it, so could debian
[13:42:11] <ross`> There are no other distros, the arch entry etc were all generated via sysrescd or the installer
[13:42:21] <Khepra> I'd bet a whole dollar there's "buggy" firmware skewed toward supporting windows and subverting other distros. tinfoil hats aside, there already exist firmwares that won't read anything but windows stubs.
[13:42:45] <jelly> ross`, and does that arch entry have \ as seen in BIOS?
[13:42:52] <ross`> Khepra: This is actually a "Linux laptop" believe it or not. It shipped with Ubuntu hehe
[13:42:55] <ross`> jelly: yes
[13:42:59] <jelly> ha
[13:43:09] <ross`> so sysrescd is "broken" too
[13:43:17] <jelly> well okay, so it's not just debian but also sysrescd
[13:43:19] <ross`> Or something, whatever that means
[13:43:38] <jelly> it might be nice to see how the "supported" ubuntu gets installed
[13:43:43] <Khepra> ross`: perfect opportunity to create FUD so users can say "eww, this is broken, gimme windows!" :))   sometimes tinfoil hats are made of fairy dust paper and glued with liquid nightmares.
[13:45:06] <ross`> In any case, I'm just glad this is working and that I'm not actually crazy lol
[13:45:32] <Khepra> you're not. the other day there was a user who literally had one of those firmwares that only read (ESP)/EFI/boot/... paths
[13:45:47] <ross`> ewwwww
[13:45:47] <Khepra> hardcoded names and refuse to read anything else.
[13:46:52] <Khepra> I'm telling you, this ain't tinfoil territory, they literally do that. and it's a tiny step sideways to assume "deliberately", "subsidies", "contracts".
[13:49:45] <ross`> It's Bill's world and it's surrounded by Gates! :D

[16:27:42] <jelly> if you need a recursor, unbound or pdns-recursor come to mind, instead of bind
[16:28:06] <jelly> if you need both, strongly consider separating the functionalities
[16:28:13] <Khepra> yeah, I know them, especially unbound. but I use bind because I need it for both roles and I already use bind on the servers in authoritative only roles

[21:18:52] * tjcarter doesn't know how many devs Debian has today. It was about 1200 when he was one of them
[21:18:54] <n4dir> there are devs and there are maintainers though.

[21:21:56] <udaba> Thas pretty good , i hope that number increasing by the year
[21:22:16] <tjcarter> it actually decreased. A lot of folks retired
[21:22:37] <n4dir> i heard that "few thousand" more than once. Perhaps some "not that official", but still doing stuff.
[21:22:41] <tjcarter> and there are easily over 100 distribution
[21:22:55] <udaba> Debian distribution?
[21:23:04] <tjcarter> Linux as a whole
[21:23:14] <udaba> Yep that true .
[21:23:19] <n4dir> mainly maintainer. I think you first can do a bit, then you become a full maintainer. Too confusing for someone like me
[21:23:27] <udaba> I hope this year Linux market share will increase as well :D
[21:23:35] <udaba> Windows 11 is a good excuse , at least for me.
[21:23:54] <tjcarter> a lot of them ultimately came from Debian, largely through Ubuntu, but Ubuntu is rather unlike Debian nowadays

[21:27:07] <PamiPetteri> Debian users usually use the command line too. I actually have a friend I was meeting last Spring or Summer that ran ordinary Debian without meddling with the command line, but I think he actually got rid of all of his computers, since he is not a computer geek. He paid the bills with computers, and also listened to music with them.
[21:28:04] <PamiPetteri> I am a computer geek, and I am somewhat conservative when it comes to the choice of the User Interface, I like MATE because it resembles Gnome 2. I think Gnome 3 uses too much of my computer's resources and sometimes crashes the computer.

[21:29:37] <n4dir> and it is much lighter than mate
[21:29:49] <tjcarter> ansgar: Debian is one of the very old Linux distributions.
[21:29:57] <n4dir> depends on your hardware of course. For most mate looks lean enough, i think

[23:42:24] <greycat> if it told you that it was renaming and replacing the file, you should *not* remove it, because it's probably a new file now.  You should see if the error message (WHEREVER it came from) still occurs the next time you try the thing that produced the error.

[23:51:06] <greycat> asarch: it's part of the systemd journal.  It's a log file.  The error message is saying that this particular log file was corrupted.
[23:52:15] <asarch> I thought it was a serious problem
[23:52:20] <PerfDave> If you hard-rebooted the machine while the log file was being written because you thought it had just hung, that might cause a corruption.
