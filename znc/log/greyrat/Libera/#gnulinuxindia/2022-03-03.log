[13:29:07] <alphap> What's a bouncer?
[13:29:11] <labrador> i love irc
[13:29:29] <iamak> Bouncer saves the conversation so you don't miss any messages when you close your computer
[13:29:31] <iamak> Or phone
[13:29:45] <iamak> @labrador why lol
[13:29:58] <iamak> Also irc doesn't allow editing messages :/

[13:30:16] <labrador> seems useless

[16:10:23] <NeoVoid[m]> @gtlsgamr the grammer magician, what do you think, the sentence would still make sense without that line?
[16:15:02] <labrador> nope NeoVoid[m] it loses its meaning
[16:15:54] <NeoVoid[m]> looks pretty much same to me
[16:16:03] <labrador> taking out the from itself is a gross grammatical mistake as there isn't any comparision in the sentence anymore
[16:16:46] <labrador> so nothing is being differentiated anymore
[16:17:11] <labrador> the "from" itself*
[16:17:11] <NeoVoid[m]> ohh right now i got it thanks

[17:32:53] <subnut> this year, they added -ve marking to numerical questions too!
[17:33:30] <gtlsgamr> My father was very disappointed, but I made him proud. I am working in a good field with good pay, JEE doesn't matter. Don't stress a lot, but make sure you give YOUR 100%.

[17:33:43] <gtlsgamr> 2015-16
[17:33:59] <gtlsgamr> 16 was my 12th passing year
