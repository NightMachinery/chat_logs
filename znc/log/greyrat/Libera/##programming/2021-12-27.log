[00:57:52] <InPhase> nomagno: So I don't see how you could possibly be talking about Linus's initial development and not later adoption, because Linux was first released in 1991, while I think the BSD lawsuits started in 1992, the first version of FreeBSD was 1993, and the version not entangled in lawsuits of FreeBSD was out in 1994.

[01:01:26] <oldlaptop> sonny: Linux includes a vast array of unmaintained or poorly-maintained drivers for hardware nobody (to a first approximation) cares about (or they would be maintained), for starters.
[01:01:26] <InPhase> nomagno: Linus said that he probably wouldn't have put in the effort if FreeBSD had been around at the time, as his first motivation was having a decent quality free Unix, and it was a lot of work to make his own.
[01:01:32] <sonny> from what I hear legal trouble made freebsd unattractive
[01:01:53] <sonny> oldlaptop like vax?
[01:01:56] <InPhase> nomagno: But it's fortunate that he did, because that setup the great debate between the two open source license types and which is more appropriate for an OS.

[01:02:58] <nomagno> Doesn't matter, you're right
[01:03:01] <sonny> deniska that was my thought too, I guess the solution is just to chop the driver support
[01:03:09] <jkk> no matter what linux is cool
[01:03:18] <deniska> sonny: but then there're people who still care about their floppy drives
[01:03:34] <sonny> too bad, for the greater good
[01:03:49] <deniska> people who don't feel like using that code will just disable the module
[01:03:53] <nomagno> I'm arguing against in-tree inclusion of everything, not against ending support of anything
[01:04:16] <nomagno> deniska: Well distros don't seem to take initiative in that regard, which is annoying
[01:04:20] <deniska> or if the module is compiled as, well, a module, if they never attach a floppy drive, a floppy drive module never gets loaded
[01:04:42] <oldlaptop> nomagno: Ah, but removing crap that nobody uses from the tree will mean that it will quit working, because nobody will keep it working out-of-tree (because nobody uses it). QED!
[01:04:59] <deniska> nomagno: if <some old scanner> works on ubuntu and doesn't on fedora, that's some user typing "fedora sux" on some forum
[01:05:47] <sonny> solution, make new pc standard, and linux distro to support it
[01:05:49] <deniska> stop making people's live harder for the goal of… having few megs fewer .ko files?
[01:05:50] <JanC> scanner drivers usually are in userspace  :)
[01:05:51] <InPhase> nomagno: The reason it wasn't released yet though was because it took them from 1988/1989 through 1992 to even get 386BSD properly working.  FreeBSD was then basically a fork off of that over a difference in direction, as was NetBSD, leading to the two public BSDs that arose in 1993 and went lawsuit-free in 1994.  Then in 1995/1996 OpenBSD joined the pile with a different security focus, and there 
[01:05:57] <InPhase> were three.
[01:06:20] <nomagno> InPhase: I know that part, thanks
[01:06:23] <sonny> standard has lastest and greatest so other stuff need no be supported
[01:06:30] <nomagno> didn't know the timing of the lawsuit mess
[01:06:38] <deniska> sonny: if I get shipped new compooters for free, fine
[01:06:48] <oldlaptop> deniska: It's tangential (and irrelevant to the present argument - if it deserves to be called "argument"), but there was in fact a CVE against qemu some time ago involving its floppy drive emulation. You never know when something like that will actually cause "a module to get loaded".
[01:07:11] <sonny> deniska: sorry, you will have to pay and upgrade
[01:07:19] <sonny> it's better this way
[01:07:23] <deniska> sonny: yeah, no, screw that
[01:07:29] <deniska> I'm not made of money :)
[01:07:38] <sonny> cmon, it helps the economy
[01:07:39] <JanC> it's not hard to blacklist modules if you want...
[01:07:45] <oldlaptop> (As I recall the attack did not implicate - directly anyway - things like kernel-level floppy drivers, hence "irrelevant to the present argument")
[01:08:35] <deniska> oldlaptop: yes, software sucks and causes pain, but let's not introduce even more pain by dropping support
[01:09:00] <sonny> don't have to, this is why you can make a new distro or standard
[01:09:04] <joe_colben> Hi, I installed thunderbird 91.4.1 and there is no setting to show tray icon. Apparantly tray icon was some older versions accomplished by extensions, but it is saying that those extensions are not relevant for my thunderbird version. Anybody know how to show tray icon with current verison of thunderbird? thanks
[01:09:17] <nomagno> This discussion is perhaps better fitted for a bot bridge between workingset, linux, and some bsd channel
[01:09:22] <oldlaptop> to my previous example: who would be "caused pain" if, say, radeonfb got kicked out of tree?

[01:10:26] <oldlaptop> (The most likely next argument about radeonfb, specifically, at least from someone who knows what it is, will be to attack the example's relevance by stating, correctly, that most "distros" do not even build it.)
[01:10:31] <nomagno> Windows forcing / attempting to force TPM 2.0 is one of the dirtiest move ever
[01:10:39] <sonny> is it?

[01:12:10] <oldlaptop> *knowledge,
[01:12:15] <deniska> risc-v is just a CPU
[01:12:22] <deniska> it's not even a machine type

[01:12:38] <nomagno> Not a CPU, wtf

[01:13:54] <edgar-rft> let's build CPUs like cathedrals
[01:13:55] <nomagno> The thing I hate about RISC-V is how it'll become incompatible in no time

[01:20:11] <bayaz> Title: BeagleV™ update 
[01:20:17] <oldlaptop> nomagno: I wonder if we will ever reach the point where FPGA-based stuff is sufficiently cheap and capable that it's practical politics to do open-hardware computers in the same way it's practical to do open-software operating systems.
[01:20:22] <nomagno> Oh, nice!
[01:20:41] <sonny> usb, pci, hdmi, on board stuff for media
[01:21:12] <nomagno> oldlaptop: It seems the price is stable right now for how relatively niche they are, there's nothing pushing it to become cheaper
[01:21:15] <oldlaptop> To this point it's been completely impractical to use FPGA-implemented CPUs for whatever "general desktop/workstation tasks" has happened to be at the time
[01:21:28] <oldlaptop> (and things like web browsers are trying to keep it that way...)
[01:21:28] <deniska> oldlaptop: I hope we'll get some way to produce chips, even if relatively fat node process, at home
[01:21:29] <sonny> or maybe this time the media component should be layered so we get servers for free
[01:21:54] <InPhase> oldlaptop: It's already possible to do.  The problem is that FPGA circuits tend to not run as fast as ASIC circuits, so you lose a factor of 3-5 on performance at the top edge.
[01:21:59] <oldlaptop> deniska: that's a total pipe dream; you do not want a semiconductor fab or anything like it on your desk, for lots of reasons.
[01:21:59] <deniska> like even something "crappy" like 200nm still would be a lot of potential fun :)

[01:22:28] <nomagno> deniska: Even a way to order custom runs of hilariously simple chips, like with PCBs
[01:22:35] <InPhase> Hi Hash.  :)  To you as well.
[01:22:47] <oldlaptop> InPhase: In practice, FPGA-based computers seem to be used (mainly) to reimplement '90s video game consoles at the moment.
[01:23:03] <deniska> oldlaptop: you don't want an injection molding machine on your desk either, we have 3d printers instead (well, there're desktop IM machines, but an analogy still holds)
[01:23:26] <InPhase> oldlaptop: That's a reasonable target, because you don't need cutting edge performance.
[01:23:49] <deniska> oldlaptop: maybe we'll figure out ways to etch things on silicon without needing chemicals you don't want to be nearby of
[01:24:09] <nomagno> You don't need cutting edge performance to manufacture fun-to-use chips either
[01:24:13] <oldlaptop> deniska: meaning you're holding out hope for some completely off-the-wall, fundamentally different semiconductor fabrication process, of the type that everybody else is also going to be intensely interested in
[01:24:24] <nomagno> But we need some non-existant tech to manufacture silicon chips right now, indeed
[01:24:28] <oldlaptop> (or is the argument going to be that the foundries somehow like dealing with stuff like HF?)
[01:25:13] *** Quits: amigojapan (uid86330@id-86330.helmsley.irccloud.com) ()
[01:25:25] <InPhase> oldlaptop: This performance overhead on FPGAs might be fundamental, because there is just more work to do to make all the gates dynamic, and more space needed to make them all updateable.  I'm not sure if it's possible to ever get FPGA systems up to the exact same performance.  It would simply require us to reach a point where that multiple doesn't matter for our needs, or where we can make up for 
[01:25:31] <InPhase> that overhead in other ways.
[01:25:52] <nomagno> Some parts of the process seem ready for consumer-level production already
[01:26:00] <nomagno> But many aren't
[01:26:36] <nomagno> For instance, you could have a faraday-cage-microwave-style-thingy and use lasers for the actual cutting
[01:26:46] <nomagno> not cutting, you get me
[01:27:02] <oldlaptop> If the state I'm thinking of is achieved, it will be because a lot of ordinary general-purpose computing no longer requires anything close to the "cutting edge". (Arguably it already sort of doesn't, but it's still impractical to simulate even a low-end smartphone SoC or the like at a reasonable cost.)

[01:27:55] <deniska> oldlaptop: there're people experimenting with less-toxic smaller-scale fabrication processes, which might be more viable than when they were originally tried, because some other tech used in the process got better in the meantime, or because they just don't need the scale or the quality the proper manufacturing needs

[01:28:22] <deniska> oldlaptop: (but yes, 3d printer but for chips is in a pipe dream stages at the moment)
[01:28:37] <InPhase> oldlaptop: Where there might be gains for FPGA-based computers is if we adjust to a JIT-like mindset with them, and create computers with massive FPGAs where we can update pieces to circuitry optimized for particular programs that need to be run, and thus get gains over what a general purpose processor can do.
[01:29:05] <oldlaptop> deniska: I'll be *far* more interested when you can start to cite actual foundries (probably not even cutting-edge ones) seriously investigating such processes
[01:29:28] <InPhase> oldlaptop: While it's clear that would help with some small subset of problems, giving large gains, it's not clear if it will help broadly for general computation in a way that can make this adequately useful.
[01:29:30] <oldlaptop> because unless there's some fundamental scaling issue, they *will* be interested
[01:29:56] <oldlaptop> InPhase: It's hard enough to exploit ordinary SMP-style parallelism.

[04:53:17] <CoderGuy> when doing a foreach statement, is it possible to somehow alter the foreach OR will the foreach just complete until the foreach conditional is met which is well to just loop through the known elements in an array prior to running the loop?

[04:53:39] <CoderGuy> languages javascript or c#
[04:53:58] <gry> can you ask the foreach to test for a value of a boolean variable? then you can alter this variable inside the loop
[04:54:06] <CoderGuy> no like

[04:54:28] <CoderGuy> is there anyway to change that conditional when using a foreach?
[04:55:06] <EdFletcher> CoderGuy: In JS, forEach will call the provided callback function once for each list element; you cannot alter this behavior. If you need to break or continue out of an iteration, use a traditional for loop

[04:55:29] <CoderGuy> I knew this was just confirming
[04:55:39] <EdFletcher> CoderGuy: You bet! 👍

[04:56:51] <CoderGuy> right, so could I start at the midpoint?

[05:29:52] <novns> CoderGuy, it isn't if you use generators
[05:30:00] <Hash> What's the use case?
[05:30:07] <Hash> Is this a theoretical question?
[05:30:18] <novns> you just get values yielded at you
[05:30:23] <CoderGuy> both theoretical and practical
[05:30:27] <CoderGuy> I have something i'm coding that runs into this
[05:30:36] <MrMobius> CoderGuy, yes. all the stuff you can do by a function calling itself can be done in one function using loops
[05:30:40] <CoderGuy> i'm splitting then splitting then splitting then splitting indefinately
[05:30:46] <Hash> I'm guesing dynamically generated array
[05:30:48] <flakland> you have arrays of unknown size?
[05:30:50] <Hash> so you don't know the epth
[05:31:06] <CoderGuy> MrMobius, but is there 1 function considering you know the depth that would account for this without having like a ton of foreach's in it?
[05:31:17] <novns> flakland, you can generate it dynamically from some unpredictable input
[05:31:21] <Hash> You should never do foreach/for
[05:31:28] <Hash> use map/reduce/filter
[05:31:32] <flakland> if you generate the array, then you know the size
[05:31:36] <Hash> Much better control and fucntionality
[05:31:49] <MrMobius> CoderGuy, yes. you can do the same work as a bunch of nested for eachs by using pointers or array indexes or whatever the language youre using has
[05:31:57] <novns> flakland, you don't generate it in memory, you yield values
[05:32:03] <CoderGuy> yeah but I want a function where given an input of a multidimensional array it can iterate over it
[05:32:07] <novns> it's never in memory intself
[05:32:12] <oldlaptop> you do not (necessarily) know the size a priori, though you know the size when (and if) you're done.
[05:32:12] <flakland> that's not an array at all
[05:32:31] <CoderGuy> MrMobius, so you'd change the pointers as you go?
[05:32:31] <novns> flakland, that's still array because it support all array methods
[05:32:43] <novns> *supports
[05:32:44] <flakland> array by what definition
[05:32:55] <Hash> by the definition of the language
[05:32:59] <flakland> which language
[05:33:03] <novns> array is an object that can be accessed by using array methods
[05:33:03] <Hash> he dind't say
[05:33:09] <oldlaptop> novns: Which definition of "generator" supports an equivalent of random access?
[05:33:11] <CoderGuy> hmm lemme think considering I change pointers
[05:33:12] <Hash> js probably
[05:33:26] <Hash> pr ,aube mpt/
[05:33:27] <flakland> ; soundsmore like som random function to me
[05:33:39] <MrMobius> CoderGuy, depends on what youre doing and how you eventually figure out the end of the array. is it terminated by a 0 like a string? but essentially you can use a pointer to walk through the entire thing. you just keep adjusting the pointer
[05:33:54] <novns> oldlaptop, you can cache results inside if you want a random access
[05:34:02] <CoderGuy> yeah I think that is the key MrMobius although that removes foreach maybe?
[05:34:15] <oldlaptop> It's not "want a random access": if you state it "supports array methods", you state that it supports random access.
[05:34:21] <novns> oldlaptop, but usually you just need to iterate
[05:34:31] <novns> and nothing more
[05:34:45] <CoderGuy> wait
[05:34:49] <MrMobius> CoderGuy, ya. again it comes down to how the array is stored but you could in theory have one for loop or while loop and one pointer and an unknown number of dimensions
[05:35:02] <CoderGuy> right right MrMobius okay so
[05:35:50] <CoderGuy> inside each array do we eventually have either an element that is an empty array or something that is not an array?

[05:40:17] <novns> tomathy, and if a company loves using free workers - it's a shitty place from the start

[05:40:54] <oldlaptop> Why do you want to do it without recursion?
[05:41:08] <EdFletcher> i think it's just a learning exercise?

[05:44:34] <EdFletcher> CoderGuy: haha thank you but i'm not, just read/listen a lot 🙂 
[05:44:40] <oldlaptop> A "good" reason might be that you're using an environment without sufficiently-good support for recursion (e.g. no tailcall optimization, meaning that the space requirement will grow with recursion depth)
[05:44:47] <CoderGuy> hey that's what smart people do, listening & reading instantly like 50% of the way

[05:45:06] <CoderGuy> the rest is honestly just an answer of how quickly you can answer something
[05:45:26] <novns> tomathy, maybe you should start with some courses
[05:45:28] <oldlaptop> a less-good version would be that you don't "get" recursion yet: that is something you're just going to need to correct sooner or later

[06:04:33] <xsperry> jwillia3, your point being?
[06:04:49] <oldlaptop> The langauge designer's desire to be less surprising to J. Average Developer is irrelevant?
[06:05:01] <PlanckWalk> Anyway, such decisions are why I haven't even bothered to learn Python.
[06:05:03] <amigojapan> vdamewood: there is a shinkansen, but it would cost like I guess at least 100usd one way for one person. Let me check
[06:05:15] <oldlaptop> I understand how you might *disagree* with that, or *not like it* (I don't, particularly), but it's not nonsense.
[06:05:24] <PlanckWalk> Maybe one day I'll need to learn Python, but not today.
[06:05:35] <jackson99> yeah Guido's hates and doesn't understand functional programming. but python has even bigger problems than pathetic support for FP 
[06:06:20] <PlanckWalk> (I have had to learn Javascript, which is worse than Python)
[06:06:32] <jwillia3> xsperry, no one expects loops to keep a record. It is reasonable and can be desirable to have a record of a call. It's not advantageous to lose the record of a call in the tail position if you're not going to be calling very deeply nor is it obvious to laymen why there is no record
[06:06:34] <amigojapan> vdamewood: actually it costs 360usd one way

[06:07:00] <jwillia3> Python has always been a language about simplicity. I think Guido's argument holds weight when viewed from that perspective
[06:07:05] <amigojapan> vdamewood: you thought shinkansen was cheap?
[06:07:30] <xsperry> jwillia3, "no one expects it" is not an argument against tail calls. adjust your expectations. looping doesn't give you the benefit of stack traces either, so it is a poor argument against tail calls
[06:07:33] <oldlaptop> Even if you have to characterize it in pejorative terms (being "idiot-friendly" or whatever), it's not a *nonsensical* position.

[06:08:34] <jackson99> python has crippled lambdas, and guido wanted to remove them all together (maybe that would be such a bad idea..)
[06:08:42] <macaw> I'd argue it's not a great arument against implementing TCE.
[06:08:48] <vdamewood> Narita to Sapporo?

[06:09:23] <amigojapan> Yeah or Haneda vdamewood 
[06:09:28] <jackson99> he removed reduce from base. he wanted to remove map and filter. he hates anything functional related. but takes pride in python's broken lexical scope :)
[06:09:29] <jwillia3> xsperry, the rest of my comment explains why a laymen WOULD expect an activation record in the stack trace... Saying "adjust your expectations" is all well and fine, but you have to KNOW the feature exists to do that. And as I said, unless you're calling very deeply, TCE provides no benefit to people in that position and certainly does take something away in this instance
[06:09:30] <oldlaptop> macaw: It would seem to limit the benefit to keep a stack trace handy just in case you might need it.
[06:10:20] <vdamewood> amigojapan: Hmm... Haneda might be a better bet since Narita will be crowded with International flights.
[06:10:40] <jackson99> jwillia3, meeting laymen's wrong expectations isn't a good argument for poor language design

[06:15:53] <jackson99> jwillia3 it can't. limiting expressiveness of a language, and killing entire style of programming, that many programmers prefer, just to appeal to newbies, is not a defensible position
[06:15:55] <macaw> oldlaptop: Hmmm... I shouldn't be arguing right before sleep, but what would be the argument against keeping a "fake" stack trace which would record every recursive function call anyway? As in, even though we replace a CALL with a JMP, we still "push" a record of this function call onto a "virtual" stack trace.
[06:16:06] <jwillia3> Not eliminating tail calls is not an "idiot-friendly" strategy. There are legitimate reasons why you would want to keep call records. Except for languages designed around recursion, you WOULD want to keep most of those records
[06:16:26] <jackson99> that is exactly what it is. you even said so yourself, just in different words
[06:16:34] <oldlaptop> macaw: That you're losing the main goal of TCE, which is to prevent space requirement from growing with (tail-)recursion depth.
[06:16:52] <macaw> Ahh... right.
[06:17:04] <vdamewood> amigojapan: What about a train ride to Aomori-ken, and a plain or boat from there?
[06:17:14] <jwillia3> jackson99, no I didn't. There was no implication there. And I don't know why you're not addressing the legitimate case of WHY you would want to keep those call records
[06:17:33] <oldlaptop> Maybe using a different calling convention for tailcalls happens to be a useful optimization by itself, but it's beside the main point
[06:17:37] <jackson99> jwilia3, again, tail calls replace regular loops. you don't get stack traces when you loop either. so there's zero loss
[06:18:02] <jackson99> you keep call records, except when you do tail recursion
[06:18:04] <jwillia3> jackson99, again, ALL tail calls are eliminated NOT just ones that mimic loops.
[06:18:49] <oldlaptop> jwillia3: (for the record, I would not call it "idiot-friendly" - the point is that even if you just HATE it so much that you MUST use such pejorative descriptions, it's not *nonsensical* - you just HATE the reasoning.)

[06:21:32] <jwillia3> jackson99, first off, not just "noobies". Any time you're presented with a callstack where things are missing, there is a problem. Second, again, it is all tail CALLS not just recursion
[06:21:39] <oldlaptop> you don't think a newbie will ever be surprised when a function call is just *POOF* gone because it happened to be the last thing a different function did?

[06:22:38] <jackson99> jwillia3, "second, again, it is all tail CALLS not just recursion" <- wrong, that is up to implementation. mutually recursive tail calls should be eliminated, but a simple non-recursive tail call doesn't have to be

[06:23:28] <jwillia3> jackson99, convenient of you to mention that now. In the absence of you specifying that, I think people would assume TCE includes every tail call
[06:23:47] <vdamewood> amigojapan: I didn't realize it was 1100k away.
[06:23:47] <jwillia3> jackson99, I'm not ignoring that. I am in favour of that design decision.

[08:04:28] <jwillia3> flakland, in principle, someone could write another implementation of the interface satisfied by an .so and create a drop-in replacement. That is not possible with a static binary. You are inextricably using the code of the original work in the static

[08:06:16] <jwillia3> flakland, not necessarily. You may have things like linker-generated code or the "library" might not be an object file at all and be something like a header that defines macros or inline functions.

[08:23:36] <oldlaptop> jwillia3: it is far from obvious, a priori, that (assuming we are not talking about some kind of header-only "library") static linking always and everywhere constitutes "derivation" whereas dynamic linking somehow does not; consider the case generally acknowledged to be LGPL-compatible where the binary-only code is distributed as object files, that can be freely re-linked with modified versions of the LGPL software.

[08:25:04] <oldlaptop> (and, indeed, the conclusion - not obvious to all at first - that linking is "derivation" under GPL applies to dynamic linking too, just as LGPL permits both)
[08:25:52] <jwillia3> oldlaptop, we are talking about and quoting from the Apache licence, specifically.
[08:27:20] <oldlaptop> I don't see how the logic is any different. Supposing it's not a special header-only case, there's no reason static linking shouldn't be "merely linking"

[08:29:45] <oldlaptop> or is the position perhaps that distributing something like an LGPL-compliant link-kit is "merely linking", but the linked binary is not?
[08:29:59] <jwillia3> oldlaptop, the original work is not easily separable from the program that uses it in a static binary. Excluding linker-generated code and header libraries, it still isn't possible to remove the original work without doing serious surgery on the binary itself.
[08:30:13] *** Joins: nitrix (~nitrix@user/nitrix)
[08:31:01] <oldlaptop> that would seem to implicate "separable from, *or* merely linking" - though there are at least two ways to parse that, damn it all

[08:31:58] <nitrix> Hey! It worked :D
[08:33:15] <oldlaptop> the argument is different again if (as would seem to be the case?) the linking work is distributed as source code, not as (or solely as) a static binary
[08:33:26] <oldlaptop> obviously source code only refers to interfaces by name
[08:34:22] <oldlaptop> (that whole conversation is a good example of why ASL2 is not a good thing, but never mind that)
[08:34:44] <jwillia3> oldlaptop, that's called out specifically in the language of the licence "or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of"

[08:36:06] *** Joins: jinsun (~quassel@user/jinsun)
[08:36:16] <CoderGuy> we set a variable known as level, the level we control as we loop, obviously with a variable condition such as while(level > 0){level--;} or you could even for loop that, level will eventually reach 0
[08:36:28] <jwillia3> Can't say. I'm not a lawyer
[08:36:57] <oldlaptop> (and whether a single program distributed as some combination of source code, link kit, and static binary is multiple "works")
[08:37:56] <CoderGuy> so now the question is, how do we control the variable level & that is simple, if(element != leaf){ level++;}  or ya know a function that tells us if it's a leaf, a leaf being not an array, and now, whenever we exit the conditional we decrease our level
[08:38:27] <CoderGuy> and from there you can simply control how the level variable gets changed
[08:38:54] <CoderGuy> obviously the question of "okay but inner array of inner array of inner array" is one that has to be answered, but that's the basic concept

[09:16:10] <jwillia3> CoderGuy, [[1], [2], [3]] any of those could be extended, so they can't be contiguous. (e.g. [[1,10],[2],[3]]

[09:16:39] <Decker> CoderGuy no you can't keep references in C#.  You can hold a pointer to the array though
[09:16:45] <CoderGuy> that's what I mean
[09:17:15] <CoderGuy> I don't want the value I want to be able to say foreach(element in myarrayholder[0]);
[09:17:41] <CoderGuy> and have it actually be based on myintarray such that if I do myintarray = null; myarrayholder[0] will also be null
[09:17:42] <Decker> which gives you an array which you can foreach through again
[09:17:51] <Decker> that will never happen
[09:18:41] <CoderGuy> Decker sure i'm just asking about the storage of a pointer though
[09:18:54] <Decker> right - there's a copy sotred in myintarray and in myarrayholder[]
[09:19:01] <Decker> therre is no relationship between those two storage locations
[09:19:05] <Decker> clearing either doesn't affect the other
[09:19:31] <CoderGuy> but is there a way in c# to store the pointer and not store a copy of the value?
[09:20:01] <Decker> no pointers are values
[09:20:06] <CoderGuy> oh
[09:20:07] <Decker> and values always copy
[09:20:26] <CoderGuy> alright so pushing to the array with value would cause extra memory that sucks
[09:20:45] <Decker> if you held the array in an arrayHolder, and put that array holder in the other array... then you could clear the array in the holder, but you'd still have the empty holder in the array
[09:20:49] <CoderGuy> dangit how do I keep track of where I am in the array then

[09:22:16] <Decker> and in the first case you get an int, in the second you get an int[] ... it's not the 'same thing'

[09:23:01] <CoderGuy> no like
[09:23:24] <CoderGuy> cuz if I store the index location, there's no way to have the same line of code give me myarray[firstvalue][secondvalue][thiskeepsoigng]
[09:24:12] <CoderGuy> so I thought "why not just store a pointer to the array" but that's copying the value
[09:24:13] <Decker> how would you declare that type?  you're now using int[][][] not int[]
[09:24:30] <Decker> 1 pointer value
[09:24:36] <CoderGuy> hmm that is a good point
[09:24:50] <CoderGuy> if input is controlled then maybe this function isn't even achievable lol
[09:25:26] <CoderGuy> I mean technically i'm creating the array as I split the string so maybe it is, but then hmmm
[09:26:41] <CoderGuy> listen don't trip off input
[09:27:15] <CoderGuy> the point is, how do you have a single line of code that can both reference myarray[x] but also myarray[x][y] 
[09:27:27] <CoderGuy> I guess you need a function at that point
[09:27:50] <CoderGuy> okay so lets see hold on
[09:28:01] <Decker> why?  it'd be like int[] []  but usually it's a 2 index thing like int[,]

[09:36:27] <CoderGuy> multiarray = ["level0-0",["level0-1-0",["level0-1-1"]]]; currarray = multiarray; foreach(element in levels){ currarray = currarray[element];}
[09:36:29] <CoderGuy> I think
[09:36:49] *** Joins: LordJohn (~lordjohn@l37-192-203-250.novotelecom.ru)
[09:36:53] <CoderGuy> so for example
[09:37:17] <CoderGuy> levels = [0,1,1];  would yield multiarray[0][1][1];
[09:37:51] *** Quits: kish` (~sid742412@user/aqua) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[09:38:27] <CoderGuy> cuz currarray = multiarray[0];   and then currentarray = currentarray[1]   which is the ["level0-1-0",["level0-1-1"]] part right?
[09:38:37] *** Quits: lalitmee__ (~lalitmee@180.94.33.221) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[09:38:44] <CoderGuy> cuz 0 is the array itself & then that array of 1
[09:39:16] <CoderGuy> and then finally currarray[1] which is ["level0-1-0",["level0-1-1"]]  ya know the second element there
[09:39:23] <CoderGuy> yeah that should work
[09:39:47] <CoderGuy> it's god awful and recursion wins BUT
[09:39:49] <CoderGuy> it should work
[09:40:20] <CoderGuy> yeah so now we just, keep track of the level you're on, and then everytime we navigate up loop through all the elements until we finally achieve having the parent lol
[09:41:21] <CoderGuy> now, this gives GREAT like amazing credit to any type of a tree/linked list for this process & just completely gives credit to recursion
[09:41:27] <CoderGuy> cuz a tree is like "uhh my parent is this here"
[09:41:40] <CoderGuy> and recursion is like "we don't care about any of this, here just finish this here ya go"

[09:46:26] <EdFletcher> yup, so well done on landing on that on your own (effectively) 
[09:46:40] <CoderGuy> yeah I like this stuff it's just fun to math out
[09:46:43] <EdFletcher> (as linked lists are also recursive data structures, so you're definitely seeing this intuitively now, at least) 
[09:46:54] <EdFletcher> CoderGuy: "math out", like that phrase 😃 
[09:47:42] <CoderGuy> I love how this process is like "listen, either you store the entire array twice, or you gotta loop through the entire array a second third 4th fifth you name it amount of times everytime you want to get the parent" "or ya know you could just store a pointer in the data structure itself"
[09:48:48] <CoderGuy> now technically it's not looping through the entire array
[09:49:00] <CoderGuy> it's looping through the elements indexed via the levels[] array

[09:49:32] <CoderGuy> but it does it everytime, so the more levels you are indexing the more it has to loop through those
[09:49:53] <CoderGuy> so if you go like 7 arrays deep, you gotta loop through 6 elements to get the parent
[09:50:00] <CoderGuy> OR ya know store each array twice

[09:54:35] <CoderGuy> although, I am splitting it myself maybe I should store the split in a linked list
[09:54:56] <CoderGuy> eh then I'd have to merge it all back to multidimensional array

Let's say user can subscribe to few type of subscriptions which are monthly/yearly each one has different amount credit they are good for, and can have one off product which give X credits which does not expire. When user uses the credit it need deduct from subscription first after if any credit from one of purchase from it. One way was thinking to have tab

[14:12:02] <vdamewood> Sadale: I'll have to double check, but if I remember, the Apache license does two things. 1: Automatically grants a patent license to contributions from patent holders that would infringe on the patent. And 2: Revokes when someone sues the original project for patent infringement.

[14:20:26] <vdamewood> Sadale: Yeah, and the NOTICE file requirements are pretty easy to comply with.

[14:27:32] <vdamewood> Sadale: And legal wording can really bit you in ass. For example, the company that developed Ms. PacMan had a contract that they'd get a cut of all 'Coin-Operated' cabinets sold. They meant arcade machines in general, since that was the term used for them at the time.

[17:17:56] <CuriousErnestBro> vdamewood I think i need to provide a barebones "plan of attack" to ease him into it
[17:17:57] <Decker> nmm
[17:18:38] <nomagno> Decker: nibbles are hexadecimal digits
[17:18:42] <nomagno> Not binary digits
[17:18:52] <Decker> righ... but they are 4 binary digits
[17:18:53] <vdamewood> nomagno: No nibbles are 4 binary digits.
[17:18:56] *** Joins: jinsun (~quassel@user/jinsun)
[17:19:26] <vdamewood> They can be represented with hexadecimal digits, though.
[17:19:38] <rsonx> yes
[17:19:38] <nomagno> vdamewood: Nibbles are 4 binary digits, which can encode exactly one hexadecimal digit
[17:19:53] <nomagno> By limiting yourself to a decimal digit, you waste an insane amount of space
[17:20:00] <Decker> or ignore A_F and use decimal digits
[17:20:04] <rsonx> but we dont want more that 9

[17:20:14] <nomagno> What
[17:20:31] <rsonx> I meant a deciam is from 0 to 9
[17:20:36] <nomagno> This is a spaces-processing time tradeoff
[17:20:46] <nomagno> And not a very nice one IMO
[17:21:24] <vdamewood> nomagno: Well, people develop systems according to their requirements, and some requirements are more important than others. Space efficiency isn't everyone's first requirement.
[17:21:32] <Decker> 5 and a part bits in 32... 
[17:22:09] <vdamewood> CuriousErnestBro: I don''t really know what to tell you. I didn't really have the problem you do.
[17:22:29] <rsonx> decimal goes from 0 to 9 but 4 bits can represent upto 15. I think that is the reason why we add 6 to the overflowing result
[17:22:44] <Decker> 9999_9999 = 5F5_E0FF  so you lose 4 in the top and 1 in the next... plus a bit
[17:23:02] <Decker> 5/32 isn't so bad?  it's only 16% less efficient
[17:23:15] <CuriousErnestBro> vdamewood okay then how about getting clients? how does that work? the plan is to ask my prof for when I get to the contract stage, he seems to have experience with that
[17:23:17] <Decker> something like that
[17:23:38] <vdamewood> CuriousErnestBro: Notice that I said 'Technically'
[17:24:02] <Decker> but then again; no funny conversion dealing with a big number.... 9999_9999 | 9999_9999 | 9999_9999 | as 1 value
[17:24:18] <vdamewood> CuriousErnestBro: I have two clients, both of which are organizations I had affiliations with before I organized my LLC. I organized an LLC just so I coud keep track of taxes easier.
[17:25:26] <vdamewood> rsonx: re adding 6, yep.

[17:28:23] <vdamewood> nomagno: How about electrical engineers building an IC from scratch?
[17:29:13] <nomagno> Hmm... Shrug
[17:29:31] <nomagno> I get it, but I also get why it's uncommon nowadays
[17:29:38] <Decker> nomagno big number math... what is the value of 0xFFFF_FFFF| when it's the 5th word of a value?  So you can put out the digits of that string

[17:30:17] <Decker> (err 10 not 9)
[17:30:38] <nomagno> Decker: Bitshift operations don't work with base 9 out of the box

[17:33:15] <vdamewood> nomagno: No I didn't.
[17:33:22] <nomagno> Sorry
[17:33:33] <nomagno> Decker, ^
[17:33:43] <Decker> well f f f f f  so what 32*5 = 120 bits?
[17:33:45] <nomagno> This gets you the value, just not in decimal :D
[17:34:06] <vdamewood> nomagno: Well, the display needs it in decimal.
[17:34:21] <vdamewood> I doubt a user is going to want to learn hexadecimal to use a cash register.
[17:34:40] <Decker> (cash register have small values)
[17:35:02] <nomagno> vdamewood: You convert on-the-fly
[17:35:08] <Decker> but no - a scientist doesn't really want to either for the curve of mercury or whatever
[17:35:28] <nomagno> Again I understand the tradeoff, but if you're gonna be doing a lot of math BCD doesn't seem like a great idea
[17:35:44] <Decker> but it's infinite prceision :)
[17:35:54] <vdamewood> nomagno: It does if you have 16 bytes of memory.
[17:36:05] <Decker> at a hardware level - back when hardware was slow anyway - it was a lot more operrations to figure out the hex to decimal conversion

[21:30:12] <nomagno> mainly because some countries thought it was a good idea to get rid of the public domain

[21:54:17] <oldlaptop> (see https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SmartTabs for ASCII-arty demonstration)

[21:54:23] <nomagno> it usually indicates a design flaw

[21:54:28] <pulse> Nah, I like nested code :P

[23:13:36] <apotheon> Blockchains are not restricted to "normal internet".  See my previous comments about mesh networking.
[23:13:36] <dodo> btc devs don't dictate the btc price.. the market does

[23:14:03] <dodo> Intelo: also notice, "faster" blockchains are worse than bitcoin, because they need more frequent reorgs
[23:14:10] <apotheon> Tor has the same limits: it must run on a network, but it doesn't necessarily have to be the current mainstream internet.
[23:14:24] <dodo> Intelo: also, "faster" is pretty meaningless because you still need to wait until you have enough hash power behind your transaction

[23:17:27] <dodo> nomagno: is that a reply to what reward is?
[23:18:02] <nomagno> 'reward', as in THE VERB, in this context, refers to tuning block size, trust levels, and transaction fees directly or indirectly
[23:18:09] <apotheon> dodo: Small blocksizes push more fees to miners, and disincentivize small transactions.  With fewer small transactions, people hold more, which makes it more expensive to buy because of reduced liquidity.  That drives up price, which benefits both holders and miners.

[23:18:58] <Intelo> correct?
[23:19:00] <dodo> Intelo: fwiw, bitcoin has a second layer, the block size is irrelevant if you use that
[23:19:02] <jeaye> dodo: Faster blockchains are not using proof of work. Any newer blockchain coming out, with scalability in mind, is using proof of stake or a similar consensus protocol.
[23:19:03] <nomagno> Intelo: No, it's just an open development model usually goes hand in hand with wide adoption of a decentralized system
[23:19:12] <Intelo> dodo ok

[23:19:31] <Intelo> nomagno ok!
[23:19:37] <jeaye> Oh, here we go.
[23:19:54] <nomagno> proof of stake is one of the few ways to determine trust that doesn't involve burning down forests
[23:19:57] <apotheon> jeaye: That's oversimplified.
[23:20:19] <Intelo> so if I want to make my own network like onion (the .onion sites), what exactly would I need (briefly). I think the TOR browser won't work and recognize this network/domains in it
[23:20:38] <dodo> that's the normal narrative of people pushing scammy proof of stake chains.. lol "burning forests".. 
[23:20:41] <apotheon> nomagno: That's oversimplified.
[23:20:49] <dodo> anyway, this seems off-topic for in here
[23:20:55] <jeaye> It's not.
[23:21:51] <apotheon> It's entirely possible to design a blockchain that reduces power consumption incentives while using PoW, too.  Monero devs did it, for instance.
[23:22:43] <apotheon> Wildly out of control power consumption is a "feature" of a PoW system that rewards massive-scale mining too much and small-scale mining too little.
[23:23:02] <Intelo> If I don't like the naming convenstion of onion sites, can I  make my own network like onion (the .onion sites), lets say .intelo sites . what exactly would I need (briefly). I think the TOR browser won't work and recognize this network/domains in it

[23:24:13] <apotheon> Intelo: You'd need to either convince a lot of people to go along with it or promote your own separate network (and make sure the software for it gets maintained).
[23:24:17] <jeaye> apotheon: Monero (PoW) has a theoretical TPS limit of 1.7k. Something like Solana (PoS) is at 65k and NEAR (PoS) is at 100k. Monero is not one of the fast blockchains I was mentioning. It's nowhere close.
[23:24:19] <Intelo> macaw just here for bullet points
[23:24:30] <dodo> Intelo: with such things the network itself is usually harder to create than the implementation

[23:53:34] <[itchyjunk]> This is how they dismissed electricity at some point in human history.
[23:53:34] <BurumaSerafuku> ran out of juice already

[23:53:37] <[itchyjunk]> Also "0".
[23:54:04] <[itchyjunk]> "0" was "immoral" because it implies nothingness, good is in everything so it has to be the devils house
[23:54:16] <[itchyjunk]> it was phrased like this is a paper few 100 years in the past, even.
[23:54:17] <macaw> [itchyjunk]: We are an evolved species. Technology brings changes at a pace vastly outpacing humans' ability to catch up.
[23:54:24] <macaw> There is a reason to be afraid.
[23:54:25] <[itchyjunk]> Every species evolved.
[23:54:29] <[itchyjunk]> We're no different.
[23:54:37] <macaw> Evolution is slow
[23:54:47] <Tech_8> you think we came from monkeys?
[23:54:47] <[itchyjunk]> Relative to life of universe?
[23:54:47] <macaw> Tech is super-, super-, super-fast.
[23:54:48] <[itchyjunk]> No.
[23:54:55] <[itchyjunk]> Relative to yours? maybe.

[23:55:28] <[itchyjunk]> yeah tech is so fast it can't mimic a microbe yet.
[23:55:31] <macaw> Tech_8: There is a lot of proof behind it. Yes.
[23:55:57] <jeaye> The proof isn't that "we came from monkeys". It's that we share a common ancestor with monkeys.
[23:55:59] <macaw> [itchyjunk]: But it can influence human decisions and a lot of other things.
[23:56:06] <[itchyjunk]> Level 3 of shapez.io froze my browser
[23:56:11] <pulse> We pretty much look like shaved monkeys too, so there's that
[23:56:13] <[itchyjunk]> So can virus.
[23:56:20] <[itchyjunk]> A lot of things can influence humans.
[23:56:23] <macaw> jeaye: Thank you for the clarification.
[23:56:24] <[itchyjunk]> Humans aren't that special.
[23:56:24] <dodo> we don't come from monkeys.. we had a common ancestor..
[23:56:25] <jeaye> Monkeys didn't exist, spawn us, and then stay the same. Common stawman argument.
[23:56:32] <pulse> Morality and tech are necessarily intertwined. The age old debate of animal testing is one example
[23:56:56] <pulse> I don't believe any amount of progress merits animal testing. That's just part of my own moral code
[23:56:59] <[itchyjunk]> Morality is the crutch of the weak.
[23:57:03] <pulse> It's not a very popular belief though
[23:57:12] <pyzozord> That is too difficult and serious a topic for me right now
[23:57:13] <[itchyjunk]> When there is no good argument, it turns into a moral one.
[23:57:20] <[itchyjunk]> Common theme in religion and dogmas.
[23:57:34] <pulse> [itchyjunk], That's what the nazis said, too. Good excuse to commit unspeakable atrocities
[23:57:42] <mrig> [itchyjunk]: morality is inate.
[23:57:48] <[itchyjunk]> pyzozord, morality or shapez.io not working on my browser?
[23:57:56] <[itchyjunk]> I don't care what the nazi said.
[23:58:01] <[itchyjunk]> A lot of people say a lot of things.
[23:58:06] *** Quits: Colt (~Colt@user/colt) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:58:14] <pulse> [itchyjunk], Then go read some history
[23:58:16] <[itchyjunk]> But morality is the crutch most major religion relied on.
[23:58:20] <[itchyjunk]> Why should I?
[23:58:21] <xsperry> nazi's never said that. they took pride in their christian morality
[23:58:26] <pulse> [itchyjunk], Because you're ignorant
[23:58:29] <xsperry> nazis*
[23:58:29] <[itchyjunk]> Because you decided to bring up nazi in a tech conversation?
[23:58:30] <pyzozord> shapez.io doesn't seem to work on my smartphone
[23:58:32] *** Joins: Colt (~Colt@user/colt)
[23:58:36] <[itchyjunk]> I think you're the arrogant one.
[23:58:44] <pulse> [itchyjunk], I think you commonly argue in bad faith
[23:58:50] <[itchyjunk]> Isn't there a law about how often nazi and hilter comes up in internet conversation?
[23:58:55] <[itchyjunk]> I am arguying in good faith.
[23:59:00] <jeaye> pulse, [itchyjunk] Seems like both of you need to cool off.
[23:59:01] <mrig> [itchyjunk]: you yourself posted a link the other day about children recognising the threat that immorality poses. 
[23:59:02] <[itchyjunk]> Notice how i didn't compare you to nazis.
[23:59:19] <[itchyjunk]> Yes, that was a study.
[23:59:22] <[itchyjunk]> What of it?

[23:59:35] <pulse> [itchyjunk], I didn't compare anyone to nazis, I said they used the same excuse. But yeah let's drop this
[23:59:46] <[itchyjunk]> Followed by "go read up on it".
[23:59:57] <[itchyjunk]> The kids picking up on "morality" is interesting concept.
