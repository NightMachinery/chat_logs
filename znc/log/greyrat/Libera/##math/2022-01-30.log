[03:31:43] <Josep> and why
[03:33:03] <PlanckWalk> No.  Because.
[03:33:35] <Josep> who do I know if the extra d compensiate for the 2ab +2ac +2bc
[03:33:55] <PlanckWalk> More verbosely: for various combinations of the variables, either can be smaller.
[03:34:30] <Josep> I tried it for every combination of a b c d or I mean I tried varius combinations and the first one is always smaller
[03:34:53] <PlanckWalk> Try d=1
[03:34:57] <Josep> for the first the nominator is greater but for the second the denominator is bigger
[03:35:06] <Josep> yeah except d=1
[03:35:13] <PlanckWalk> Then try d=1.1
[03:35:15] <Josep> or d negative
[03:35:22] <Josep> ok ill try d = 1.1
[03:35:23] <PlanckWalk> Or 0 < d < 1
[03:36:33] <Josep> yeah you are right
[03:36:54] <Josep> but I know for a fact that d is greater than the number of variables in the nominator or I should rather say equal to them
[03:37:04] <Josep> d is equal to 3 in the example above
[03:37:34] <PlanckWalk> Ah, so comparing RMS to arithmetic mean
[03:37:53] <Josep> yeahhh
[03:38:00] <Josep> how did you know
[03:38:44] <Josep> I am trying to figure out if we have say 1+2+3/3 the average then why if we square the top and take the square root of the equation we will have a average greater than the pevious average but also between 1 and 3
[03:39:36] <PlanckWalk> There's a nice geometric illustration of that
[03:40:29] <Josep> so for example if we have the 3 numbers of 1 4 5 their mean is 1+4+5/3 but if we did sqrt(1^2+4^2+5^2)/sqrt(3) we will get a slightly larger average in the same range between 1 and 5
[03:41:23] <Josep> my explanation is that the average of 1^2+4^2+5^2 its average is 1^2+4^2+5^2/3 is between 1^2 and 5^2 so if we do square root we get a number that is between 1 and sqrt(5^2) =5
[03:42:36] <Josep> but now I am trying to give an explanation as to why this new average is greater than the last one , so the I squared the normal average 1+4+5/3 so we obtain (1+4+5)^2/9 to compare it to 1^2+4^2+5^2/3 thus this formula (a+b+c)^2/d^2  or (a^2+b^2+c^2)/d?

[04:11:31] <Josep> in my opinion when we say 6/2 we could either say 6 divided by 2 people or say how many 2's to make 6 since 2x3=3x2 but in the case of decimals in the denominator we can't say 6 divided by 2.11 I suppose we say how many 2.11 make six only
[04:12:05] <PlanckWalk> Yes, it's finding a nubmer that when multiplied by 2.11 gives 6
[04:12:53] <PlanckWalk> 2.11 is 211/100, so that number is  600/211, which is approximately 2.84
[04:13:28] <Josep> yes but if you go to do it by hand like if you try to divide in real life 6 on 2 people you can do it but I am 100% sure you can try dividing 6 on 2.11 go try it now if you can tell me

[04:16:14] <Josep> how can we do it
[04:16:54] <Josep> it makes sense to say 6 kgs for 2.11 meters squares or 6 apples per 1 and half person

[04:17:18] <Josep> lol
[04:17:31] <Josep> also on the denominator its always 1
[04:17:37] <PlanckWalk> Eh, 1.5 people often doesn't make much sense, but 2.11 square metres certainly does.
[04:17:41] <Josep> so its like 6.03 kgs per meter square
[04:18:17] <Josep> yeah 2.11 make sense but you can't divide 6 into 2.11 lol
[04:18:23] <PlanckWalk> Sure you can
[04:18:34] <PlanckWalk> You get about 2.84
[04:18:59] <Josep> and how do I do the division?
[04:19:01] <PlanckWalk> And 2.84 kilograms per square metre makes no more or less sense than 3.00 kilograms per square metre.
[04:19:13] <Josep> so if I had 3 persons I give each person an apple till I have 0 apples

Why is it even stated as a theorem as the union of the two sets is by definition linearly depended? I mean by definition the span of S is all the possible linear combinations of the elements in S, and the elements in S are linearly independent.
[04:46:20] <remii> Right after the statement in the theorem "v \in span(S)", we have that v is a linear combination of elements in S and thus, S \union {v} is linearly dependent.
[04:47:51] *** Quits: ProfSimm (~ProfSimm@87.227.196.109) (Remote host closed the connection)
[04:52:16] <remii> Either the proof is really easy or it shouldn't be stated as a theorem to begin with? I have seen multiple such "weak" theorems where it seems that we are just twisting the definitions to make it sound like a theorem./
[04:55:28] <johnkeats7> filling the sausage, they say
[04:56:17] <remii> What?
[04:56:41] <PlanckWalk> One direction is easier to prove than the other, so it's not completely trivial.  It certainly isn't a difficult theorem though.
[04:57:22] <PlanckWalk> Maybe 4 lines?
[04:57:41] <PlanckWalk> (Which is not much longer than the statement of the theorem)
[04:59:19] <PlanckWalk> It's not true for modules in general, for example.
[05:00:03] <remii> How so?
[05:00:50] <PlanckWalk> If v is not in span(S), there might still be some coefficient such that there is a linear combination summing to zero.
[05:01:04] <PlanckWalk> (In a module with scalars that aren't a field)
[05:01:33] <remii> Yea but a vector space is defined over a field.
[05:02:00] <PlanckWalk> Yes.  I was showing that you actually need to *use* the field nature of the scalars here.
[05:02:49] <PlanckWalk> So it's not totally trivial.
[05:02:53] <remii> Yea I mean it is stated before that we are using a field F whenever we specify a vector space. I agree that the theorem should include the field.
[05:03:03] <PlanckWalk> (in the proof)
[05:03:03] <remii> But to me this theorem sounds like something similar to, "If U and W are subspaces of V, show that the zero vector is in U \union W".
[05:03:18] <PlanckWalk> And I'm saying that it isn't like that.
[05:03:39] <PlanckWalk> Because that would be true of pretty much *any* structure, not just vector spaces.

[05:03:45] <remii> But they do state that we are talking about a vector space over a field.
[05:03:51] <PlanckWalk> Yes, of course.
[05:04:19] <remii> So you mean that the subset can be another structure?
[05:04:21] <PlanckWalk> One direction doesn't even need the fact that your scalars are a field.  The other does.
[05:05:27] <remii> Which one is which?
[05:06:07] <PlanckWalk> v in span(S) => S u {v} linearly dependent  is easier.
[05:07:16] *** Joins: argento (~argent0@168-227-97-23.ptr.westnet.com.ar)
[05:07:24] <remii> And the other way, my proof would be: If S \union {v} is linearly dependent, there exist scalars a1, ..., an, c not all zero such that a1s1 + ... + ansn + cv = 0.
[05:08:01] <remii> Since by definition c != 0, it shows that v is a linear combination of s1, ..., sn \in S.
[05:08:10] <PlanckWalk> Nope
[05:08:18] <PlanckWalk> You need one more step
[05:08:26] <PlanckWalk> Well, you probably just mentally skipped over it
[05:08:34] <remii> Well yea solve for v but I skipped that.
[05:08:45] <PlanckWalk> Yes, and that's the step that's nontrivial.
[05:09:19] <PlanckWalk> Because it doesn't work in modules, which are otherwise very similar to vector spaces, while the other direction does work in them.
[05:10:21] <ski> (you also need to arrive at ⌜c ≠ 0⌝)
[05:10:49] <PlanckWalk> True
[05:10:52] <remii> PlanckWalk Ok so in general then as you said it doesn't work.
[05:11:05] <PlanckWalk> So that's two nontrivial steps skipped
[05:11:12] <remii> c != 0 is not by definition, since s1, ...,sn are linearly independent.
[05:11:18] <remii> is by*
[05:11:24] <remii> As stated in the theorem.
[05:11:45] <remii> In my proof, sorry*
[05:11:47] <remii> "there exist scalars a1, ..., an, c not all zero"
[05:11:48] <PlanckWalk> It follows from the definition, but isn't *by* definition.
[05:12:28] <remii> In my proof I say "there exist scalars a1, ..., an, c not all zero". For if c = 0, then some a_i is 0 contradicting the fact that S is linearly independent.
[05:12:42] <remii> a_i != 0
[05:12:43] <remii> *
[05:14:05] <PlanckWalk> Yes, if c =0 then  (Sum a_i s_i) + 0 v = 0  which implies  Sum a_i s_i = 0  by the properties of the zero scalar and zero vector.
[05:14:06] <ski> you need to discount the potentiality that ⌜aᵢ⌝ is nonzero, for some ⌜i⌝, while ⌜c⌝ is zero
[05:14:20] <remii> PlanckWalk What do you mean? I mean by definition the vector that solves s1 + ... + sn = 0 is (0, ..., 0). "there exist scalars a1, ..., an, c not all zero" really forces c to be nonzero.
[05:14:43] <PlanckWalk> Yes, but you need to apply other axioms to get that
[05:14:44] <ski> yes
[05:14:54] <PlanckWalk> It's not just "by definition"
[05:15:22] <PlanckWalk> If you allow anything that depends upon a bunch of the axioms to be "by definition" then all theorems are "by definition".
[05:15:24] <ski> (and this is a non-constructive equality checking step)
[05:16:41] <remii> So what, I need to say "c != 0, for otherwise, there would be a_i = 0, contradicting that s1, ..., sn are linearly independent"?
[05:16:52] <ski> yup

[05:57:24] <remii> PlanckWalk If I'm given a theorem "Prove that a set S of vectors is linearly independent if and only if each finite subset of S is linearly independent." Can I show this by showing if a subset is linearly dependent, then there must be a vector in that subset that can be written as a linear combination of the others. And since this same vector is in
[05:57:25] <remii> S, and is a linear combination of elements in S, it contradicts the fact that S is linearly independent? Or is there a smarter way of doing this.
[05:57:40] <remii> I mean the first step, since it's an iff.

[06:06:10] <PlanckWalk> Yes, that's one
[06:06:27] <ski> in linear algebra, a linear combination always involves finitely many vectors. or, if you prefer, all but finitely many coefficients (corresponding to the set of vectors you're having a linear combination over) are zero
[06:06:32] <PlanckWalk> or 35 billion, 123 million

[07:46:57] <remii> How is n - m > 0

[07:48:45] <PlanckWalk> That comes from the induction hypothesis

[07:49:49] <PlanckWalk> L doesn't have all theu's in it
[07:50:07] <PlanckWalk> It just has v's
[07:50:27] <PlanckWalk> It only has any u's in it if some of the v's in L are also in G
[07:52:48] <PlanckWalk> I'd probably label that subset G_m just so we don't have to write {u_1, ..., u_{n-m}} all the time
[07:53:42] <PlanckWalk> We know that  L_m U G_m  spans  V.
[07:54:26] <remii> I will be honest, I'm lost at (9). v_{m+1} is a linear combination of L = {v_1,...,v_{m}} and {u_1, ..., u_{n-m}} right?
[07:54:40] <remii> Since they generate V.
[07:55:06] <PlanckWalk> Yes
[07:55:52] <remii> So right after, Note that n - m > 0 is where I'm actually lost.
[07:55:57] <remii> Where does this even come from?

[11:30:22] <PlanckWalk> (The theorem doesn't even need span(S) = V)

[11:37:23] <remii> How does it really differ from what you guys said with "a size of basis n" instead of "dim(V) = n"?
[11:37:48] <PlanckWalk> "dimension" is based on the property "all bases have the same size"

[11:38:31] <PlanckWalk> If you haven't already proved that all bases are the same size, you can't yet use the term "dimension".  If you have, then this theorem's proof is trivial.
[11:38:32] <remii> But is it wrong to assume that here?
[11:38:39] <int-e> Well, your theorem is essentially stating that all bases have the same size.
[11:38:55] <int-e> So if you assume the concept of dimension then it becomes trivial.
[11:39:04] <remii> Ahh I see now.
[11:39:52] <int-e> If S is linearly independent and spans V then S is a basis, so |S| would be the dimension of V which is n.
[11:40:39] <int-e> But that contradicts |S| > n so S is (not not) linearly dependent.
[11:42:12] <remii> I see what you mean now, I used dim(V) = n without proving that all basis have the same number of vectors. Could a better theorem for proving dim(V) then be stated as "Let V be a vector space having a finite basis. Then every basis for V contains the same number of vectors." ?
[11:42:25] <int-e> yes
[11:43:24] <int-e> I'd go for "Let B and B' be finite bases of a vector space V. Then |B| = |B'|."
[11:46:05] <remii> Hmm I see. Well there is a proof I can use proved earlier in the book where it says that if L is linear independent and G generates V, then there exists a subset H of G, such that span(L u H) = V.

[13:47:50] <riv> sqrt(2) is not in Q(sqrt(2)sqrt(3))

[14:08:14] <riv> {1, sqrt(3)} is a basis for Q(sqrt(3))

[14:14:27] <riv> a basis for Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) has size 4
[14:14:38] <riv> so a basis for Q(sqrt(2)) is not a basis for Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3))
[14:16:08] <cadmio> right
[14:16:56] <cadmio> but in term of linear independence, could that be disrupt by considering the larger field with more vectors?
[14:17:25] <cadmio> I mean {1, sqrt(2)} linear independent in Q(sqrt(2)) is not anymore independent in Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3))

[14:22:50] <PlanckWalk> cadmio: Independence always depends upon which field of scalars you have, i.e. when talking about extension fields, the base field.
[14:24:16] <tom__> How is the proposition you are supposed to prove here not a tautology? (exercise 1)
[14:24:17] <tom__> https://courses-archive.maths.ox.ac.uk/node/view_material/44048
[14:26:04] <tom__> If you are taking the shortest distance between two sets of points then of course there has two exist two points that have that distance
[14:26:36] <PlanckWalk> tom__: inf is not min
[14:27:03] <PlanckWalk> inf {x in R | x > 0} = 0
[14:27:05] <tom__> Yeah
[14:27:09] <PlanckWalk> But that set has no min
[14:28:01] <tom__> So basically we are proving that given one set being compact and the other closed and both non empty then  inf = min
[14:28:20] <PlanckWalk> Yes
[14:28:41] <tom__> Do we have to engage with metrics at all?
[14:28:48] <PlanckWalk> Yes

[20:20:25] <Z-module> Just remember that if F < K are fields, and b in K is algebraic over F with minimal polynomial over F of degree n > 0, that means that {1, b, ..., b^(n-1)} is a basis for F(b) over F. Because the power b^n is expressible in terms of all the lower powers, using that min. poly.
