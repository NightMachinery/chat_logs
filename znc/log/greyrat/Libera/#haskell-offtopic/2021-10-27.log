[11:13:27] <dminuoso> zincy: IME most companies that sell security software/appliance of any kind are just snakeoil vendors.
[11:13:37] <dminuoso> Designed to trick you into thinking that you just need to pay for that silver bullet nobody else has.
[11:14:37] <dminuoso> And to the inexperienced muggle tasked to solve someone elses computing problems, it's a convenient idea that you just need to buy your way out of your insecure mess you have.
[11:15:29] <dminuoso> A long while ago someone approached me with some "API security gateway", essentially a HTTP proxy with a bunch of PCRE regex that when matched would block requests, they advertised their appliance as being "particularly secure because even their TLS stack uses a custom implementation"
[11:15:58] <dminuoso> So they went along with "It's so secure. Heard of heartbleed? Because of our custom TLS implementation, we were not vulnerable"
[11:16:10] <dminuoso> The thing you have to ask yourself, what kind of people actually buy into this nonsense.

[12:07:09] <ongy[m]> most people even run windows
[12:09:47] <ongy[m]> OTOH, I've created a document before, that details some of the security features that windows got, that we don't have. And it's depressing how little priority on security there is in the linux world :(
[12:11:52] <arahael> ongy[m]: Linux partially has the convention of "don't be an idiot" when it comes to software, though, so eg, I'm not likely to get a virus by chatting to people on IRC here, nor am I likely to infect my system by opening a text file using a text editor.
[12:11:59] <arahael> But I do know what you mean.
[12:13:02] <arahael> (I picked those examples, because mIRC viruses are a thing, and also, you can infect your system by opening a text file using a text editor these days, especially on non-linux systems but *sigh*, now also on linux systems I strongly suspect).
[12:16:49] <ongy[m]> arahael: at work our product is a linux based desktop OS. So I got to assume the dumbest possible user
[12:17:01] <ongy[m]> and also company security people without ideas of security asking questions towards our sales/PMs
[12:17:53] <arahael> What frustrates me is the wack-a-mole approach of using antivirus software.
[12:18:16] <ongy[m]> I just want some active kernel defenses :/
[12:18:30] <ongy[m]> I have some whack ideas how to do that with ebpf though D:
[12:20:00] <arahael> Yeah?
[12:23:06] <ongy[m]> The idea is that it tracks some "task" through the kernel. so we get the syscall entry, stash some data, append that data with some stuff in deeper layers, and check expected vs actual return of syscall
[12:23:57] <ongy[m]> e.g. with an open syscall, it checks that the fd returned is properly created and the associated struct file is actually what we expect. Not redirected in any nonsense way. similar for read/write it checks that it went through the associated operations of the file, not caught and replaced to hide stuff
[12:24:53] <ongy[m]> check an iteration of /proc/ to actually show all pids known to the scheduler. to ensure there's no pids hidden. STuff like that. with some statistical value how often we check. Which can be dynamic over some metric to play with the slowdown of this approach

[22:17:13] <tomsmeding> monochrom: fair, quite possible my and their definition of "familiar" are different
[22:17:27] <monochrom> Or perhaps, when both being honest and not affected by Dunning-Kruger.
[22:17:51] <geekosaur> "you use regexes to solve this problem therefore regexes. doesn't matter that I don't understand them"
[22:18:11] <geekosaur> so, regexes everywhere and nobody wants to admit they don't understand them
[22:19:10] <monochrom> Now, survey the haskell community to survey how many people actually know these terms!  isomorphism, thunk, closure, strict.
[22:19:36] <tomsmeding> heh
[22:19:41] <monochrom> i.e., as opposed to, "I heard everyone else saying those words so I say them too"
[22:21:00] <monochrom> When I was young, I was as surprised as you were too, upon the first instance of "wait, so you don't know what you're supposed to know???!!!!"
[22:21:35] <tomsmeding> well, I think I wasn't surprised so much because I felt like those people _should_ know them
[22:21:38] <monochrom> After all these decades, after seeing it for the nth time... cynicism is the logical conclusion.
[22:21:48] <tomsmeding> though I must for honesty's sake say that perhaps there was an element of that
[22:22:10] <monochrom> Actually I was also well-prepared by a great joke.
[22:22:40] <tomsmeding> mostly it was because I just find it quite unlikely that you haven't yet encountered them sufficiently often to at least be able to use them practically; the knowledge would have been obtained by osmosis as it were
[22:23:00] <monochrom> When you think you know everything, you qualify for a bachelor degree.  When you find out that you know nothing, you qualify for a master degree.
[22:23:04] <monochrom> And the punch line....
[22:23:29] <tomsmeding> what about me in 4.5 years
[22:23:31] <monochrom> When you finally find out that your PhD supervisor knows nothing too, you qualify for PhD!
[22:23:35] <tomsmeding> yay
[22:23:54] <monochrom> And all 3 stages were true for me haha.
[22:24:34] <monochrom> I did find out that my supervisor didn't know something I thought he would know. I was able to trump him regarding a certain piece of knowledge in our field.

[22:26:13] <zincy_> It is interesting working with other people with serious dun-kruger issues
[22:26:21] <zincy_> They make *you* feel delusional
[22:27:33] <zincy_> Also really hard to explain concepts to them
[22:27:37] <zincy_> Where do you start
[22:29:44] <monochrom> I wouldn't start.

[22:30:31] <monochrom> I wouldn't explain. I would destroy. Use counterexamples to destroy their preconception.
[22:30:58] <monochrom> When they finally realize that they know nothing, they qualify for my teaching.
[22:31:15] <tomsmeding> Socrates' method?
[22:31:17] <zincy_> haha
[22:31:23] <tomsmeding> or at least, similar in spirit
[22:31:30] <zincy_> Counterexamples until exhaustion is a good idea
[22:32:02] <zincy_> I think you 
[22:32:13] <zincy_> learn faster after the beginner stage
[22:32:29] <zincy_> not slower as those graphs people like to point to show
[22:32:57] <tomsmeding> don't those graphs show visible knowledge
[22:33:21] <tomsmeding> as in, the more you know, the broader your surface is, so the smaller the additions, relative to what you already know
[22:33:32] <monochrom> Nah, they wouldn't listen until they see their problems.
[22:33:45] <tomsmeding> so it _looks_ like your knowledge didn't grow much, because the amount didn't really change much, relatively

[22:34:12] <tomsmeding> which doesn't mean that the absolute increments can't have different behaviour
[22:34:31] <monochrom> If they don't admit they're wrong, they don't want to learn. They think there is nothing to learn.
[22:34:54] <zincy_> tomsmeding: I am confused, I need an example haha
[22:35:06] <tomsmeding> if someone refuses to admit they're wrong in the face of evidence, then I just say "okay then suck it" :p
[22:35:13] <zincy_> There is another one - please can you give more examples
[22:35:13] <tomsmeding> but I've met few such people yet
[22:35:17] <monochrom> Indeed, even after my counterexamples, some people still don't admit/believe they're wrong. In which case I don't waste time.
[22:35:40] <monochrom> Right? For example flatearthers, antivaxxers...
[22:35:44] <tomsmeding> zincy_: if you grow 5 by one, you get 6; that's a significant increase. If you grow 1000 by one, you get 1001; not much different
[22:36:24] <zincy_> Yeah
[22:36:26] <tomsmeding> zincy_: and even if you grow 1000 by 10 (assuming you learn faster the more you know), you still have only 1010, which is still quite similar to 1000
[22:36:36] <zincy_> I meant to say rate of change increases
[22:36:51] <zincy_> my *units* of learning per day is increasing
[22:36:59] <tomsmeding> so seen from outside, your knowledge doesn't grow so much -- you give mostly the same answers to the same questions, barring this one particular area you now learned about
[22:37:06] <tomsmeding> so the graph flattens

[22:37:19] <zincy_> yeah
[22:37:33] <tomsmeding> and "seen from outside" is all too often also "seen from inside"
[22:37:48] <tomsmeding> where you get demotivated because you don't seem to progress as much
[22:37:50] <zincy_> Yes 
[22:37:55] <tomsmeding> this happens in language learning communities
[22:38:11] <tomsmeding> (you know, the ones where 99% doesn't get beyond beginner stage)
[22:38:17] <tomsmeding> "intermediate plateau" and all that
[22:38:25] <zincy_> I just keep reminding myself of how my problems are getting more sophisticated than what the heck is a functor
[22:39:04] <tomsmeding> yeah a friend of mine said today, actually, that he recently re-joined the student chat for a functional programming course that he took years ago
[22:39:12] <zincy_> Its hilarious when you learn a new field and then you look back after 6 months
[22:39:20] <tomsmeding> gave him a confidence boost that despite feelings he'd actually progressed since then

[22:41:12] <tomsmeding> yes
[22:41:15] <zincy_> What in?
[22:41:39] <tomsmeding> for now, automatic differentiation on functional languages, I guess
[22:42:10] <tomsmeding> but I want to move a bit towards linking "proved, general, impractical algorithms" to "efficient, practical implementations"
[22:42:12] <tomsmeding> with AD as an example
[22:42:30] <tomsmeding> not sure how that will work out, only 1/2 year since I started

[22:50:55] <zincy_> tomsmeding: I want to learn how AD works actually seems very cool
[22:51:10] <zincy_> But I should probably learn how manual differentiation works first hahaha
[22:52:25] <tomsmeding> lol
[22:52:33] <tomsmeding> you should know what differentiation is supposed to compute
[22:53:23] <tomsmeding> and I guess having facility with the chain rule is also a necessity for having a good idea about what on earth is going on :)

[23:53:58] <zincy_> A video on youtube with Thorsten Altenkirch
[23:54:49] <zincy_> He says that type theory is a programming languge
[23:55:07] <geekosaur> it's a mathematical language, I'd say
[23:55:09] <tomsmeding> heh thorsten
[23:55:17] <zincy_> Isn't that a bit like saying set theory is a programming language?
[23:55:22] <tomsmeding> kind of
[23:55:57] <geekosaur> the theory itself is not a programming language although programming languages can be designed around a particular type theory (thus ghc with some variant of System F)
