[12:52:51] <amigojapan> My psychiatrist said meditation is really really good for depression
[12:53:20] <JesseDesu> medication ryhmes with meditation
[12:54:30] <Llamamoe> amigojapan: Addressing your sleep disordered breathing is good for depression
[12:54:32] <JesseDesu> The developer states that version 5.91 is the final one to support 16-bit Windows;[8] 6.35 is the last to support Windows 95, NT 4.0, 98, and ME. The current version supports Windows XP and later.[
[12:54:36] <JesseDesu> i was so close
[12:54:57] <Llamamoe> And no, you're not cured if you no longer have apnea, the gap between "healthy sleep" and "no serious apneas" is huge 
[12:55:34] <amigojapan> Llamamoe: I still have trouble breathing if I sleep facing up
[12:55:55] <amigojapan> So I sleep sideways
[12:57:27] <Llamamoe> amigojapan: Get a BiPAP. Sleeping sideways does not fix the issue. Neither does losing weight, or ENT surgery. 
[12:57:47] <Llamamoe> The only true permanent fix is palatal expansion and/or double jaw surgery to advance the jaws 
[12:57:51] <Bco1981> NT 4.0 still
[13:02:05] <amigojapan> Llamamoe: then why is sleeve surgery allowed if you have sleep apnea? Sounds like losing weight may actually work
[13:02:55] <amigojapan> Otherwise insurance would not pay for it
[13:03:53] <Llamamoe> amigojapan: Because "sleep apnea" is a miscommunication between science and medicine and it's bullshit. It's caused by anatomically compromised airways, and Sleep Disordered Breathing only starts to look like traditional sleep apnea(instead of UARS) as you age or get fat, but neither of those are the root causes. 
[13:04:09] <Llamamoe> And doctors basically learn outdated knowledge from each other 
[13:04:58] <Llamamoe> Also your weight gain is caused by insulin insensitivity that's probably caused by the sleep apnea itself
[13:05:13] <Llamamoe> You need a BiPAP (or even at least a shitty CPAP) to manage your Sleep Disordered Breathing
[13:05:18] <amigojapan> I trust doctors Llamamoe .I will try losing weight first, see how that goes
[13:05:25] *** Joins: mei (~mei@user/mei)
[13:05:28] <Llamamoe> People lose weight using CPAP because it reverses the insulin resistance 
[13:07:50] <Llamamoe> amigojapan: Most doctors are more like laborers than engineers or scientists. They perform the common tests, they prescribe the common treatments, and reading science or understanding root causes is foreign to them. And literally every human struggles to change their mind when they're used to knowing or doing something a certain way 
[13:07:57] <amigojapan> Anyway it seems I am losing weight with keto, already lost 14kg
[13:10:16] <Llamamoe> Okay but losing weight will not resolve your condition one hundred percent
[13:10:25] <DunceCotus> doctors are medical certificate and prescription pushers
[13:10:32] <DunceCotus> diagnosis? Hahahaha
[13:11:06] <Llamamoe> DunceCotus: My experience with doctors was they they're there to gaslight you and make you stop complaining and if you stop complaining you're cured in their eyes and they give themselves a pat on the shoulders 
[13:11:39] <DunceCotus> Llamamoe yep
[13:11:45] <DunceCotus> Llamamoe same as my experience
[13:11:51] <Llamamoe> I presented multiple times with being literally too debilitated by overwhelming fatigue to know what was going around me, and "a person your age sitting at home and not working is abnormal, it's your fault, go to a shrink and stop bothering me"
[13:12:13] <Llamamoe> Even my therapist just assumed I was lying to worm my way out of trying to follow her recommendations on improving my life
[13:12:20] <DunceCotus> uurggh
[13:12:32] <Llamamoe> And tried to gaslight me by saying "you said there's schizophrenia in your family... you know... this sounds a lot like it" 
[13:12:41] <Llamamoe> Or "you're narcissistic just like your father, the way you reply to me makes it obvious"
[13:12:47] <Llamamoe> Fucking cuuuunnnttttttt 
[13:12:57] <DunceCotus> they just want you out of the door
[13:13:02] <DunceCotus> its not about helping people
[13:13:21] <Llamamoe> Yes
[13:13:28] <DunceCotus> maybe they got into it to help people but the system changes them
[13:13:32] <Llamamoe> Like the whole thing is fucked up 
[13:14:00] <Llamamoe> Doctors are overworked, given zero incentive to stay up-to-date with knowledge or correct erroneous knowledge, given way too much authority over patients who are taught by society to just "stop thinking and trust the doctor"
[13:14:06] <Llamamoe> Which, in my experience, is literally the worst thing you can do 
[13:14:37] <DunceCotus> yeah
[13:14:48] <Llamamoe> Like did you know that vast majority of cases of insomnia are actually Sleep Disordered Breathing(UARS or apnea), and have nothing to do with mental state? 
[13:14:54] <DunceCotus> its hard to find a doctor who is informed and cares
[13:14:56] <Llamamoe> And the chronic depression and anxiety are symptoms, not causes
[13:15:23] <DunceCotus> Llamamoe hmm ok
[13:15:30] <amigojapan> Llamamoe: the insurance company sure has inventive to discourage a major surgery like sleeve surgery
[13:15:55] <amigojapan> Insentive
[13:18:17] <Llamamoe> Honestly, I'd even go as far as to say most cases of depression are either: Sleep Disordered Breathing, childhood trauma, chronic loneliness(lack of a sense of connectedness or negatively biased social cognition, not lack of people around you), and ongoing abusive social environments

[13:22:50] <amigojapan> And chemical imbalance in the brain
[13:22:53] <Llamamoe> No. 
[13:23:02] <Llamamoe> That's a stupid as shit myth that was never true
[13:23:18] <Llamamoe> It wasn't even a scientific theory in the first place, the "chemical imbalance" thing was pure marketing 
[13:23:34] <amigojapan> Well I am done discussing this with someone that denies chemical imbalance
[13:24:23] <Llamamoe> Neurobiologically depression is mediated by neuroinflammation, HPA axis dysregulation, impaired vagal-sympathetic tone, impaired sleep processes.
[13:24:44] <Llamamoe> amigojapan: Dude, I literally read neuropsychiatry papers and textbooks for fun
[13:25:00] <DunceCotus> it may well be a chemical imbalance but that's kinda a non-answer, like what's causing the imbalance?
[13:25:07] <DunceCotus> the cause is what should be investigated
[13:25:31] <Llamamoe> There actually isn't any serotonin deficiency in depressed people. There's alterations in serotoninergic neurotransmission but they're downstream consequences of other factors, and not the root cause or even super important to depression
[13:25:34] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: even eating different foods can cause it
[13:25:54] <Llamamoe> Serotonin deficiency is present in some people with aggression disorders, but not depressed people 
[13:27:22] <Llamamoe> There's actually more alterations to dopaminergic and opioidergic pathways than the serotoninergic ones
[13:27:49] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: seems many mental illnesses can be boiled down to a lack of dopamine in the brain
[13:28:27] <DunceCotus> its not about food
[13:28:41] <DunceCotus> its about inflammation or issues with metabolising food
[13:28:54] <DunceCotus> rarely is it to do with deficiencies
[13:29:08] <DunceCotus> and if it is deficiency its likely more due to metabolic issues
[13:29:25] <Llamamoe> Not lack of dopamine, but impaired dopamine signaling. And it's not a neurochemical alteration, dopamine pulses are basically signals that predict reward(positive outcomes) versus cost and current state(primarily fatigue). And most chronic motivation deficits are literally just chronic fatigue that's below the threshold for "I'm tired enough that it's obvious I'm tired"
[13:29:45] <Llamamoe> And dietary sensitivities often have more to do with immune dysregulation than as a cause of their own IMO
[13:30:12] <Llamamoe> My gastrointestinal and dietary issues went away with BiPAP treatment via healthier sleep
[13:32:17] <Llamamoe> Like a third of humans have SDB, more than that lack meaningful interpersonal connections, healthy families are rare and most people have some degree of CPTSD from it, and lack of personally(to oneself or one's family/friends/colleagues) meaningful occupation is overwhelming(who loves the work they do everyday?)
[13:32:58] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: for example a lack of lithium ion blood can cause such a lack of dopamine in the brain. I am not sure how healthy people get lithium ion their blood tho

[13:35:25] <Llamamoe> I drink my own mix of electrolytes that contains around 400mcg/L of lithium ions (via Lithium Chloride)
[13:35:49] <Llamamoe> amigojapan: Rarely. Modern humans have the healthiest diets we ever had, even accounting for refined sugars and oils 
[13:36:19] <Llamamoe> At least healthiest since the dawn of agriculturization ~14,000 years ago
[13:36:20] <DunceCotus> Llamamoe have you tried functional medicine?
[13:36:25] <Llamamoe> DunceCotus: What's that?
[13:36:53] <DunceCotus> Llamamoe its a type of medicine which is more holistic, they try to get to causes of inflammation 
[13:36:57] <DunceCotus> rather than just treating symptoms
[13:37:19] <Llamamoe> I'm in a chronic disease community focused on a similar thing
[13:37:41] <Llamamoe> There's a scientist in there who's extremely close to the root cause of ME/CFS and some other viral-related chronic fatigue disorders
[13:37:50] <DunceCotus> GPs and even specialists seem more concerned with treating symptoms
[13:37:54] <DunceCotus> than addressing causes
[13:37:59] <Llamamoe> And in the Sleep Disordered Breathing community, which is probably the #1 cause of chronic health problems in the world
[13:39:51] <Llamamoe> Basically: If you don't have effortless even during mild physical activity nasal breathing, have receded jaws, history of orthodontics, tooth extractions/crowding, a high-arched instead of nearly-flat palate, your airways are probably compromised. If you experience any insomnia, nocturia, nightmares or waking up groggy/adrenalinized. Or if you have any daytime ADHD/fatigue/sleepiness. You probably have SDB. 
[13:40:01] <Llamamoe> I am far too obsessed over this
[13:40:08] <Llamamoe> Gonna go out and socialize with my cousin instead
[13:41:48] <Llamamoe> Oh right I forgot one more thing,
[13:42:00] <Llamamoe> Gut dysbiosis is also a common cause of chronic health issues

[14:08:49] <DunceCotus> maybe its delusion
[14:08:55] <Llamamoe> Because their memory retrieval got fucked up in a way where the things they remembered felt too alien to be the same world 
[14:08:55] <DunceCotus> but its what I have experienced, and its profound
[14:09:15] <Sapphirus> I'm treating my chronic insomnia from long haul covid with 10 milligrams of melatonin every night

[14:10:11] <amigojapan> No DunceCotus with you
[14:10:16] <DunceCotus> I don't think my memory retrieval is fucked up, its just retrieving memories from a former/alt world
[14:10:59] <DunceCotus> amigojapan that would be simplest explanation
[14:11:05] <DunceCotus> but the simplest explanation is not always the truth
[14:11:14] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: what is more likely? That your memory retrieval is messed up or that you come from an alt world?

[14:13:29] <Sapphirus> 04:44 <Llamamoe> Like did you know that vast majority of cases of insomnia are actually Sleep Disordered Breathing(UARS or apnea), and have nothing to do with mental state?
[14:13:31] <Sapphirus> Not true. 
[14:13:36] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: then it is just a matter of assessing is you are such a person DunceCotus

[14:14:26] <Sapphirus> Especially not, when we're talking about damage caused by pathogens like COVID.
[14:14:35] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: why not rely on the majority experience. Which is the lack of Mandela effect? Why do you choose the ones that agree with you?

[14:17:48] <Sapphirus> I'm currently treating it with 10mgs of melatonin, Llamamoe. At my worst, I couldn't sleep more than 4 hours and was getting no REM.
[14:18:24] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: covid causes insomnia?
[14:19:03] <Sapphirus> amigojapan, it can cause chronic insomnia, yeah. 
[14:19:26] <Llamamoe> Sapphirus: If you can, find an actually good sleep neurologist. Failing that, get screened for UARS/OSAS just in case via WatchPAT 
[14:19:36] <amigojapan> I see Sapphirus ouch
[14:19:54] <Sapphirus> I've had the most energy I've had in over a year after falling ill with COVID back in March of last year.
[14:23:33] <Sapphirus> Llamamoe, I have no reason to believe it's UARS given that melatonin is working so well. Even fixed the depression symptoms I was having alongside the fatigue.
[14:25:24] <Llamamoe> Sapphirus: You're taking melatonin in doses that dramatically exceed the levels you can have in your brain naturally
[14:25:45] <Llamamoe> At those doses it's basically acting as a sedative that keeps you neurologically asleep
[14:26:01] <Llamamoe> And sedatives tend to make you stay asleep regardless of what the underlying cause of your sleep problems is

[15:27:05] <lastonestanding> was anime already invented back then?
[15:27:27] <Arcorann> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katsud%C5%8D_Shashin <-- the oldest anime (according to some people)
[15:27:28] <ImoutoBot> [title] Katsud≈ç Shashin - Wikipedia
[15:27:40] <amigojapan> Oh moonjelly kitaro is classified as shounen and natsume as shoujo. And as far as I remember there is no Princess
[15:28:04] <amigojapan> Yes lastonestanding 
[15:28:18] <moonjelly> princess is not a must-have
[15:28:54] <Berlin36> yo
[15:29:12] <amigojapan> Arcorann: the first ones that actually have the gives of anime were from tezuka sensei tho
[15:29:25] <moonjelly> yoyoyo
[15:29:35] <Berlin36> it says it's gonna be 39¬∞C next week....
[15:29:44] <moonjelly> yoyoyo no kitaro
[15:30:03] <amigojapan> Ouch Berlin36 be careful
[15:30:15] <moonjelly> you might melt
[15:30:17] <Berlin36> yeah, it's pretty hot
[15:30:23] <amigojapan> Lol moonjelly 
[15:30:23] <JesseDesu> whoa @ new bokutachi no remake
[15:30:35] <JesseDesu> SUPRISING TWISTS
[15:31:03] <JesseDesu> reminds me so much of my college days
[15:31:39] <moonjelly> maybe JesseDesu will appear in the next episode
[15:31:48] <JesseDesu> yaas
[15:31:52] <lastonestanding> they put shrines on top of building in Tokyo?!
[15:32:07] <lastonestanding> and they say that Tokyo has good air quality???
[15:32:32] <amigojapan> They do lastonestanding . Not every building
[15:32:53] <lastonestanding> aha
[15:32:54] <moonjelly> shrines are everywhere, some really small
[15:33:07] <lastonestanding> I know that they are "everywhere"
[15:33:20] <lastonestanding> but them being on top of big buildings
[15:33:25] <lastonestanding> that is news to me
[15:34:05] <DunceCotus> what are shrines for
[15:34:23] <amigojapan> lastonestanding: but you can't go on the ceiling in schools, that is a lie
[15:34:34] <Publios> oh
[15:34:50] <JesseDesu> publios
[15:34:54] <JesseDesu> did you see my F-16

[15:35:24] <JesseDesu> its just the cockpit for now
[15:35:40] <Publios> wow nice
[15:35:43] <JesseDesu> ty
[15:35:44] <amigojapan> Hi Publios 
[15:35:46] <moonjelly> shrines are places for the gods to live, to be enshrined in some object
[15:36:00] <Publios> hi hi amigojapan 
[15:36:08] <lastonestanding> who are the gods?
[15:36:30] <DunceCotus> is there a cap on gods
[15:36:35] <Publios> nein
[15:36:45] <JesseDesu> there should only be one
[15:36:51] <moonjelly> no kami limit that I know of, but I'm no expert
[15:36:56] <lastonestanding> why would gods wear a cap??
[15:36:56] <JesseDesu> right luke-jr 
[15:36:58] <DunceCotus> one God sounds limiting
[15:37:00] <amigojapan> lastonestanding: there are said to be 800000 gods
[15:37:05] <lastonestanding> what???
[15:37:20] <DunceCotus> too many Gods spoil the broth
[15:37:32] <Publios> lol
[15:37:36] <Publios> calms 
[15:37:44] <DunceCotus> clams
[15:37:52] <JesseDesu> camels
[15:37:53] <lastonestanding> then how does a japanese person know which shrine to visit?
[15:37:56] <DunceCotus> God is a lobster
[15:38:00] <Publios> lastonestanding:  local 
[15:38:02] <JesseDesu> God is in the TV
[15:38:20] <lastonestanding> Publios: the closest one?
[15:38:33] <amigojapan> Publios: it's similar to how Catholics select their patron saint
[15:38:38] <DunceCotus> there are many Gods but they kinda overlap in function
[15:38:42] <Publios> lastonestanding:  sort of, yeah
[15:38:46] <Publios> amigojapan is correct
[15:38:49] <lastonestanding> that works I guess
[15:38:52] <Publios> the local gods are like local saints
[15:38:59] <Publios> you just do what everyone near does
[15:39:06] <lastonestanding> and if I don't like my local god, I'll just pick another one
[15:39:16] <Publios> no, that's not how it works
[15:39:17] <Publios> historically
[15:39:19] <Publios> you just deal
[15:39:24] <moonjelly> there can be more than one god in each shrine
[15:39:37] <DunceCotus> Gods are part of despotic socius
[15:39:37] <moonjelly> each having their own cozy place
[15:40:16] <JesseDesu> a what
[15:40:34] <amigojapan> Each god is said to have powers for some specific stuff. For example there is a good of study and people go there in their entrance exam to highschool
[15:40:41] <Publios> ^
[15:40:55] <lastonestanding> and it actually works?
[15:40:55] <DunceCotus> however you can have monotheistic despotic socius, but then Kings etc. are the divine interlocutors  
[15:41:37] <DunceCotus> I imagine its like the placebo effect
[15:41:39] <amigojapan> No lastonestanding . No religion actually works
[15:41:40] <Publios> im not sure that is the point
[15:41:41] <DunceCotus> it 'works'
[15:41:54] <Publios> the point is a feeling of control
[15:42:04] <Berlin36> i never understood religion
[15:42:12] <lastonestanding> so, it works from within
[15:42:17] <Berlin36> i've been in a church about 4 times in my life
[15:42:23] <DunceCotus> it works mostly for those in power
[15:42:25] <Publios> lastonestanding:  it might
[15:42:30] <DunceCotus> to control their populations
[15:42:47] <Berlin36> but if it helps people then why not..
[15:42:53] <lastonestanding> DunceCotus: even in Japan?
[15:42:58] <DunceCotus> lastonestanding yeah
[15:43:04] <Berlin36> i guess people just need to believe in something 
[15:43:09] <lastonestanding> I think japanese religion is pretty harmless
[15:43:13] <lastonestanding> no?
[15:43:17] <DunceCotus> no
[15:43:20] <Publios> um
[15:43:21] <DunceCotus> no religion is harmless
[15:43:25] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: back during ww2 sure
[15:43:28] <DunceCotus> religion is about control
[15:43:34] <Berlin36> yeah
[15:43:37] <lastonestanding> japanese religion is about zen
[15:43:37] <Publios> no it isn't
[15:43:42] <Publios> religion serves multiple purposes
[15:43:56] <Berlin36> for example?
[15:44:02] <lastonestanding> I say "japanese religion", but what is it actually called?
[15:44:04] <amigojapan> That's Buddhism lastonestanding 
[15:44:18] <amigojapan> lastonestanding: shinto
[15:44:23] <lastonestanding> ah right
[15:44:25] <lastonestanding> shinto!
[15:44:26] <DunceCotus> people believe to help them cope within a system of repression and subjugation
[15:44:31] <Publios> the japanese cult of the emperor was more related to shinto religion and other stuff than zen buddhism
[15:45:09] <Publios> DunceCotus:  some people believe. that's a really simplistic understanding
[15:45:13] <amigojapan> Publios: back during ww2 they actually tried to get rid of Buddhism too
[15:45:24] <Publios> amigojapan:  wow, I didn't know that but I'm not surprised
[15:45:25] <DunceCotus> Publios but what does their belief do
[15:45:27] <moonjelly> shinto has the shrines, buddhism has the temples, often hard to tell them apart for an untrained eye
[15:45:52] <amigojapan> Publios: yeah most old temples were replaced with shrines
[15:45:57] <Publios> DunceCotus:  it does a lot of things, what do you mean?
[15:46:01] <DunceCotus> japan was all kinds of fucked up during ww2
[15:46:25] <DunceCotus> Publios it does a lot of things sure
[15:46:37] <amigojapan> moonjelly: shrines will have a torii gate
[15:46:41] <DunceCotus> but the primary purpose at least for the system is to keep people adherent to it
[15:47:04] <Publios> DunceCotus:  and how is that any different than nationalism?

[15:47:12] <DunceCotus> Publios its not really
[15:47:17] <Publios> agreed
[15:47:23] <moonjelly> amigojapan, yes, but sometimes there are both temples and shrines in the same location
[15:47:25] <DunceCotus> however religion can cross national borders
[15:47:26] <Publios> the nation state is just a new religion
[15:47:47] <DunceCotus> Publios well that and the Economy
[15:47:50] <Publios> DunceCotus:  yes it can, because it has more meaning

[15:50:30] <DunceCotus> KatrinValerie but zero two was kinda forced into it too
[15:50:38] <amigojapan> moonjelly: the monk I know told me about the order to replace temples with shrines during ww2
[15:50:40] <Berlin36> i didn't watch the anime

I'm sick of waking up every morning with six nuts in my boxers and knowing that those are nuts that should've been busted inside of Zero Two‚Äôs tight dino pussy. I want her to suck all of my humanity out and ride me to death. Anyways, do you guys relate to this?
[15:51:09] <Berlin36> lmao
[15:51:17] <DunceCotus> I'd let her Darling in my Franxx

[15:51:42] <Publios> deal with it weebs
[15:51:43] <KatrinValerie> let them teens be lewd among them teens
[15:51:46] <DunceCotus> its no Evangelion
[15:51:47] <amigojapan> moonjelly: thank God
[15:51:53] <Berlin36> i'd let her shake my spear
[15:52:00] <DunceCotus> KatrinValerie nobody's stopping them
[15:52:00] <Publios> amigojapan:  do you think Darling in the Franxxx sucks too?
[15:52:02] <JesseDesu> does anyone here like hyperpop
[15:52:04] <KatrinValerie> Publios: It is a decent mecha show for what it is
[15:52:05] <Publios> nothing about it was quality
[15:52:05] <moonjelly> amigojapan, which god will you thank?
[15:52:06] <Publios> imo
[15:52:07] <Berlin36> franxxnx
[15:52:13] <Publios> it isn't a decent mecha
[15:52:14] <Publios> it's boring
[15:52:16] <amigojapan> Publios: I did not watch it
[15:52:17] <KatrinValerie> Publios: Obviously there are shows that are much much better
[15:52:22] <DunceCotus> that ol' Franxx spirit
[15:52:47] <DunceCotus> Publios its no Bokurano
[15:52:47] <Berlin36> why is she called 02 lmao
[15:53:11] <amigojapan> moonjelly: the god of coke
[15:53:22] <moonjelly> Berlin36, it's an evangelion reference
[15:53:35] <Berlin36> whaa
[15:53:54] <Berlin36> a friend of mine told me tos watch evangelion like a 100 times
[15:54:01] <amigojapan> Yeah that show obviously took ideas from Eva
[15:54:04] <JesseDesu> theres a woman who made it into seal team 6
[15:54:05] <Berlin36> i didn't watch it tho
[15:54:40] <DunceCotus> and Eva took ideas from Thunderbirds, Gundam, Patlabor
[15:54:41] <KatrinValerie> Berlin36: it is overhyped but an interesting piece of art
[15:54:50] <KatrinValerie> if you are into watching stuff made by really depressed people
[15:55:30] <DunceCotus> KatrinValerie right, and that's part of its appeal
[15:55:38] <Berlin36> i watched a pretty cool anime called: Your lie in april
[15:55:41] <DunceCotus> its an anime where the characters are all depressed and self-loathing
[15:55:43] <KatrinValerie> which reminds me that I need to watch some Lars von Trier stuff
[15:55:44] <DunceCotus> fun times
[15:55:44] <Berlin36> had someone watched it?
[15:55:49] <KatrinValerie> But idk if I can
[15:56:11] <DunceCotus> KatrinValerie Von Trier's stuff can be quite "shocking" for the sake of it
[15:56:17] <DunceCotus> but he is a great director
[15:56:26] <KatrinValerie> Berlin36: I loved that one, it gave me many feels in times of emotional numbness
[15:56:42] <DunceCotus> KatrinValerie watch Dancer in the Dark
[15:56:55] <Berlin36> yee, i also liked the music in there
[15:57:03] <Berlin36> it's classical music!
[15:57:12] <KatrinValerie> Anyone else feeling like the weather is extreme lately_
[15:57:17] <KatrinValerie> ?
[15:57:25] <Berlin36> ye
[15:57:30] <DunceCotus> extremely lately
[15:57:30] <Berlin36> 39¬∞ next week
[15:57:31] <moonjelly> the weather gods are upset
[15:57:33] <KatrinValerie> Wheather be like, what are seasons?
[15:57:33] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: global warming
[15:57:36] <Berlin36> Celsius
[15:57:55] <JesseDesu> people driving cars
[15:58:21] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: Yeah, it's just discouraging to see that the development leans towards to worse estimates
[15:58:33] <Berlin36> at least im going to be dead when the earth will be completely fucked up
[15:58:38] <Berlin36> xd
[15:58:46] <KatrinValerie> The more pessimistic climate models seem to hold up
[15:59:01] <DunceCotus> Berlin36 and then you'll reincarnate in a post-apocalyptic earth
[15:59:07] <KatrinValerie> wait that's just plain wrong like that
[15:59:10] <DunceCotus> so we have all the incentive to make it better
[15:59:41] <KatrinValerie> I mean, things are leaning more onto the worse side of the predictions
[16:00:00] <DunceCotus> KatrinValerie its not looking pretty
[16:00:06] <Berlin36> oof reincarnating in a post apocalytpic earth seems pretty cool
[16:00:14] <KatrinValerie> we have this frame of uncertainty in the predictions and it seems the global average temp is rising faster than we had hoped
[16:00:26] <DunceCotus> Berlin36 well our grandparents/great grandparents already did
[16:00:36] <KatrinValerie> Yeah, it doesn't look like the 2 degree goal is achievable at this rate
[16:00:37] <DunceCotus> and it just created this industrial capitalist world :(
[16:00:40] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: not really. In the 80s they predicted NYC would be under water by 2000
[16:00:49] <Berlin36> oh no! anyways
[16:00:56] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: We have more accurate models than in the 80ies now
[16:01:07] <DunceCotus> nothing cool about post-apocalyptic world
[16:01:08] <amigojapan> Ok KatrinValerie 
[16:01:13] <DunceCotus> we'd lose so much knowledge
[16:01:15] <KatrinValerie> I am refering to the more recent IPPC reports and stuff
[16:01:22] <Berlin36> yeah
[16:01:23] <KatrinValerie> did I get the acronym right?
[16:01:35] <KatrinValerie> Oh god, anyone remember the leaked mails and the madness that ensued?
[16:01:38] <DunceCotus> IPCC? 
[16:01:47] <Berlin36> what leaked mails
[16:01:49] <KatrinValerie> Yes

[16:02:01] <KatrinValerie> Iirc from researchers around the IPCC
[16:02:07] <DunceCotus> emails always leaking everywhere
[16:02:11] <KatrinValerie> Was a huge thing in conspiracy theorist circles
[16:02:18] <Berlin36> lol
[16:02:19] <KatrinValerie> there was source code leaked for some model
[16:02:28] <Berlin36> ThE EaRtH is FlAt gUYs
[16:02:34] <KatrinValerie> and they had a portion of code with a variable called fudge_factor
[16:02:35] <DunceCotus> conspiracy theorist circles who deny human-caused climate change
[16:02:40] <KatrinValerie> That was a form of statistical adjustment
[16:02:48] <KatrinValerie> To improve the fitting 
[16:02:56] <Berlin36> btw, a long time i thought flat earthers is just a meme
[16:02:59] <DunceCotus> fudge-factor ... caramel?
[16:03:00] <KatrinValerie> And people that don't know stats be like
[16:03:04] <Berlin36> but they do really exist lmao
[16:03:07] <KatrinValerie> They are fudging the results
[16:03:27] <DunceCotus> well the problem with statistics is some degree of fudging is required
[16:03:27] <KatrinValerie> Berlin36: they aren't even the weirdest
[16:03:35] <Berlin36> welp...
[16:03:40] <amigojapan> Berlin36: it is hard to tell if they are serious or not
[16:03:52] <Berlin36> i am sure they are
[16:03:52] <DunceCotus> the Earth is pretty flat to me
[16:03:58] <Berlin36> i mean look at them lmao
[16:03:58] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: The dedicated core really is serious about it.
[16:04:01] <DunceCotus> but rest assured NASA shows us truth
[16:04:03] <Berlin36> nooooo DunceCotus
[16:04:09] <KatrinValerie> It's a collective dunning kruger effect

[16:06:16] <Berlin36> im dying from theese memes
[16:06:22] <DunceCotus> Berlin36 I assume they are jokes
[16:06:25] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: some of them say outlandish things like "the sun and the moon are holograms
[16:06:44] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: Yeah, it gets quite bizar
[16:06:58] <DunceCotus> hologrammatic celestial dome
[16:07:01] <Berlin36> DunceCotus well yeah, they are memes 
[16:07:02] <KatrinValerie> I think that CTs work a bit like cults
[16:07:20] <DunceCotus> Berlin36 me-mes
[16:07:37] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: they find affirmation in their CT groups that they cannot get in their everyday life, it makes them feel important and valuable, because they are fighting a huge conspiracy.
[16:07:50] <KatrinValerie> This is pretty much the same as religious cults
[16:08:03] <KatrinValerie> They also claim to hold a truth that the general public is not aware of
[16:08:32] <Berlin36> flat earther solar system: O . ‚Ä¢ _ ‚Ä¢ o√ò ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢
[16:08:41] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: well some conspiracies are true but not all
[16:09:20] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: real world conspiracies just function in completely different ways than people imagine
[16:09:32] <KatrinValerie> also real world conspiracies are already plenty spooky
[16:09:36] <KatrinValerie> why do people need to make shit up
[16:09:45] <Berlin36> +
[16:09:47] <KatrinValerie> When we have evidence of real conspiracies 
[16:10:05] <Berlin36> what conspiracies
[16:10:10] <KatrinValerie> Nobody even talks about the snowden leaks anymore, do you believe anything has changed since snowden?
[16:10:21] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: Japan teaching in history books nothing about Japanese forced prostitution in Korea during ww2 is a real conspiracy
[16:10:26] <KatrinValerie> Do you really believe that the US government just stopped spying on their citisens
[16:10:41] <Berlin36> lol no
[16:10:51] <Berlin36> every country is spying
[16:10:58] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: Yeah, even here in Germany we still have huge gaps there
[16:11:12] <Berlin36> lmao let me tell you a story about the kaspersky password manager
[16:11:13] <KatrinValerie> and more and more people are like "We don't want to hear about this anymore, we didn't do that!"
[16:11:16] <amigojapan> I see KatrinValerie 
[16:11:52] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: at least that admits it happened
[16:12:06] <Berlin36> they made a password generator that generates passwords based on an algorithm and they were strictly generated for every second
[16:12:19] <Berlin36> (they were not random)
[16:12:26] <KatrinValerie> But really, teaching a more complete modern history of Germany does not fit in the Schedule
[16:12:39] <KatrinValerie> They'd need to rework things to truely explain all the nazi crimes
[16:13:22] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: the Japanese government is actively saying "it did not happen
[16:13:31] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: Nobody ever talks about how far the nazis pushed back against liberalism
[16:13:32] <Berlin36> the best we can do for our privacy is to use open source software
[16:13:41] <KatrinValerie> And how much it pushed society back
[16:14:03] <amigojapan> I see KatrinValerie 
[16:14:17] <KatrinValerie> Like how homophobia even became a bigger thing

[16:14:56] <KatrinValerie> in the cities transvesties and the likes were normal and tolerated
[16:15:13] <amigojapan> moonjelly: it's an opposite to a swastika. It's a manji
[16:15:21] <KatrinValerie> In those times that term was an umbrella term for pretty much all gender non-conforming folks
[16:15:34] <moonjelly> amigojapan, some people think they are the same thing
[16:15:55] <KatrinValerie> And we had some amazing research into human psychology back then as well, which got stomped out by the Nazis.
[16:15:58] <KatrinValerie> So much knowledge lost
[16:16:16] <KatrinValerie> Things we have only been recovering in the past few years have been there in the 1920ies already

[16:21:12] <moonjelly> so the tiny shrines are called hokora, and even being shinto they can have manji on them

[17:12:22] <moonjelly> kuragahime had no princes or princess, only in the name

[17:21:32] <moonjelly> so the answer is that you go to the temple
[17:21:48] <amigojapan> I guess moonjelly 
[17:22:17] <amigojapan> moonjelly: but after explaining what we do many people say "it sounds boring
[17:22:26] <moonjelly> I guess you needto come up with your own conclusion
[17:25:54] <amigojapan> moonjelly: basically we chanted with Japanese drum, then we did yoga stretching, then we did imagining we went to the end of the universe, then we did a kind of meditation which is about counting numbers while breathing, then we drank tea and finally we did another kind of meditation where you just repeat 'a'while breathing
[17:26:51] <moonjelly> ah, I imagined only sitting still and meditating
[17:27:09] <moonjelly> that sounds more interesting
[17:27:19] <amigojapan> moonjelly: that is zen, this is shingon
[17:27:35] <amigojapan> Zen is just sitting still
[17:27:45] <moonjelly> idk the difference
[17:28:25] <amigojapan> It's a different sect. And different practices of meditation. I think shingon is much more fun
[17:28:38] <amigojapan> Zen really does sound boring
[17:29:05] <moonjelly> I found a list of shoujo anime and the most popular is Ouran Koukou Host Club

[19:04:32] <DunceCotus> The barbers of early days were also the surgeons and dentists. Most early physicians disdained surgery and the barbers did surgey of wounds, blood-letting, cupping and leeching, enemas and extracting teeth. Since the barbers were involved not only with haircutting, hairdressing and shaving but also with surgery, they were called barber-surgeons.
[19:04:32] <DunceCotus> They formed their first organization in France in 1094.
[19:05:25] <DunceCotus> barber-surgeons of history books != barber-surgeons of reality
[19:06:01] <DunceCotus> I would think they are actually fairly new inventions, not pre-existing late 1700s
[19:06:31] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: so there were many answers to "what will it be today?
[19:06:47] <amigojapan> An enema please
[19:07:02] <DunceCotus> I think the 'middle ages' as we know it today is actually a creative re-writing of history in a way that makes palatable a post-apocalyptic condition of human society
[19:07:57] <DunceCotus> like all the stuff we needed or had at that time (like barber-surgeons) was 'backwritten' into history
[19:08:25] <DunceCotus> to repress the the actual conditions of the apocalypse or the actual former society  
[19:08:33] <dfch> neurobarbers of iron age
[19:08:50] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: you mean it is "revisionist history"?
[19:09:05] <DunceCotus> neuromancers of the ion-age
[19:09:21] <DunceCotus> amigojapan right
[19:09:31] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: what was the apocalypse?
[19:09:42] <DunceCotus> a world-wide flood event
[19:09:52] <DunceCotus> or several small flood events
[19:10:04] <DunceCotus> and there was likely some war
[19:10:37] <DunceCotus> amigojapan the society before ours was a highly technically advanced one
[19:10:44] <dfch> DunceCotus so basically major Motoko Kusanagi :3

[19:14:48] <DunceCotus> the post-apocalyptic conditions after the fall of that Great Society meant that we had fallen hard back against nature
[19:15:11] <DunceCotus> our technology that helped us to mesh with nature was destroyed or non-functional or unusable with the remaining knowledge
[19:15:35] <DunceCotus> so we had to go back to 'basics', agriculture, subsistence production of surpluses etc.

[22:17:44] <mathu> my amazon gripe is more than half the time i order they will tell me my package was delivered to a package locker but it actually arrives a day or two later
[22:18:19] <mathu> i called amazon support the first time bc i was concerned it got stolen and they said "yeah sometimes we just say it was delivered, it should be there tomorrow or the next day"
[22:18:46] <mathu> they have an internal tracker that apparently knows the real delivery estimate, but the one they choose to put on the site is not that one?
[22:19:13] <Sxem> i am going to try out decensored porn. i'm curious how good decensoring is. this may really open up asian porn for me. i usually avoid censored porn. turns out porn decensoring is done by artificial intelligences. i wonder if it draws a cartoon vagina. or maybe use generic vagina images where the pixellation was. they insert the reconstructed vaginas into the censored videos.
