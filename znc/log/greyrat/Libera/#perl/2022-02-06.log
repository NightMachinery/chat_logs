[04:40:26] <dg_dg>  Do you have a nice link explaining how to modify any CPAN module ? It looks like difficult to find any on duckduckgo or google... 
[04:43:26] <LeoNerd> Didn't we chat this this morning?
[04:44:15] <dg_dg> @LeoNerd, yesterday for me (i'm in Thailand). Yes, i don't want to eat your time or to stay stick on the chat to just execute things without understand. I want also to learn something.
[04:44:46] <dg_dg> @LeoNerd, so do you know a link that can teach something around for this subject ?
[04:44:47] <LeoNerd> We got as far as me asking you to show tge paths. you didn't
[04:45:00] <LeoNerd> If you do that we can get somewhere
[04:45:35] <dg_dg> May i consider there is no link instructive about how to modify CAPN module on our computer ?
[04:45:44] <dg_dg> CPAN
[04:45:48] <LeoNerd> Stop. please stop
[04:45:53] <LeoNerd> listen to tge words i am saying
[04:46:15] <LeoNerd> if the situation was simple, the thing you did would have worked. it didn't
[04:46:24] <LeoNerd> therefore something more complex is going on
[04:46:27] <dg_dg> I can not be FREE to learn something from any link ? you don't want ?
[04:46:29] <LeoNerd> we need to find out what
[04:46:50] *** Joins: gizmomathboy (~gizmomath@206.127.53.107)
[04:46:57] <LeoNerd> we can find out by you obtaining the information I suggested you look at
[04:47:09] <LeoNerd> you haven't done so yet. 
[04:47:23] <LeoNerd> please do that so we can continue helping you
[04:47:34] <ether> dg_dg: CPAN modules are just code; you are free to modify them locally. But there is probably a better way of doing what you want to do -- if we could understand what that is. Please could you describe your problem?
[04:48:00] <LeoNerd> ether: we got as far as editing a file and running a program and it didn't have an effect
[04:48:03] <LeoNerd> I suspect path issues
[04:48:11] <ether> ah I see
[04:48:20] <dg_dg> man... you have also to understand that i have not all my time at any time. I'm also building my house alone... So i think i can win a bit time by learning from a link instead of loose our time (not only mine) here to turn around and write thousand of lines to just explain something that should be more simple if i can read a tuitorial about this subject. 
[04:48:36] <LeoNerd> I asked to see a paste of perldoc -l vs. perl -M print inc vs. what he edited in editor
[04:48:39] <ether> dg_dg: LeoNerd is a good person and wants to help you. it's okay if you only have a little time, but please answer his questions so he can help.
[04:49:20] <dg_dg> Thank you for your help. If there is an adult there to share a link to teach how it is working CPAN and how to modify a module, thank you for that attention.
[04:49:29] <LeoNerd> If there was a tutorial it would be telling you to do what you already did do, and then you'd come back here and ask why it didn't work
[04:49:39] <LeoNerd> So lets pretend you've already done that
[04:49:45] <dg_dg> @ether, yes, good to help, thank you for that.
[04:50:22] <dg_dg> @LeoNerd, where is this tutorial please.. Please, stop to enforce, if there is a link, now please... SHARE.
[04:50:37] <LeoNerd> I have no idea of one
[04:50:47] <dg_dg> ok, no problem, maybe there is none.
[04:50:57] <LeoNerd> Would you like me to first write the article so I can link you to it?
[04:51:16] <dg_dg> I will be back later to ask for help when more time (hope it will have someone at this time).
[04:51:18] <LeoNerd> It would tell you all the things I already told you yesterday
[04:51:30] <dg_dg> so it serve nothing... very good !
[04:51:49] <dg_dg> bravo
[04:51:51] <LeoNerd> I have asked you a very specific qurstion. you have not replied
[04:52:07] <LeoNerd> this makes it hard. why are you not answering my question
[04:52:30] <dg_dg> because i didn't have any more time. Can you understand that some human doesn't stick all there time in front of a computer ? I have a real life also.
[04:52:33] <LeoNerd> You type a few small things then copy&paste the output into the paste site so we can see
[04:52:44] <LeoNerd> It would have taken you 2 minutes
[04:52:48] <dg_dg> yes, i will.
[04:52:54] <LeoNerd> you have spent more time arguing here already
[04:53:05] <dg_dg> Ok LeoNerd ...
[04:53:13] <dg_dg> see you next boys.

[17:05:09] <rindolf> simcop2387++
[17:06:00] <simcop2387> and now all my core switches are connected on 10GbE too.  only ones left that aren't are at my desks because they don't really need it.
[17:09:23] <dg_dg> LeoNerd, ok, i get it now... i didn't have any Build.PL file, but a Makefile.pl, and i hed to chmod 755 after to run "perl Makefile.pl" on Makefile to be able to run it for test and install module.
[17:10:20] <dg_dg> I would be very happy to find, one day maybe if it's existing, something like a tutorial to teach how to build and maintain a module and how to use cpan for everything it can do...
[17:10:24] <dg_dg> Thank you guys.

[17:13:20] <dg_dg> So how to contribute to this project to be able to pull a request for that implementation ?
[17:13:36] <dg_dg> ology, i forget all the time... sorry
[17:13:42] <ology> There is no github issues link on the metacpan page for it?
[17:14:33] <dg_dg> ology, no, i didn't find any. I find the gdm/Curses::UI github page that doesn't have any issue tab. But maybe it is the bad github project ? How to find the correct github one ?
[17:15:08] <buZz> not all ppl use github issues for their github projects
[17:15:29] <buZz> sometimes ppl abuse the issues as 'general support' a lot, and some ppl get superannoyed by that, just turn it all off

[17:19:34] <dg_dg> yes, but maybe an opportunity to learn how to contribute on rt.cpan.org ?
[17:20:14] <dg_dg> there is no link i can see about "create an account"...
[17:21:31] <dg_dg> so i suppose that i can not (it is esoteric kind of group maybe) and i have to send an email to rt-cpan-admin@bestpractical.com
[17:22:14] <dg_dg> Why is it so complicate to just create an account to contribute ?
[17:22:44] <ology> Everything is not new and shiny and perfect.
[17:23:23] <dg_dg> well... sure not. But is there just a way to create an account to contribute  with something or the door is close ?

[22:28:46] <krismatrix> so..i am trying the Crypt::Passphrase. It seems that I don't understand something. In my signup for I create the hash and store it in a SQL database. But when I try to validate it in the signin form, it doesn't authenticate.
[22:29:26] <krismatrix> So i tested with a small demo script and realized that the hash generated is different each time you run.
