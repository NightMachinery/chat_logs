[00:18:13] <SamuelMarks> nedbat - So I `ast.walk` (or `NodeVisitor`) the AST, and when I find FunctionDef|ClassDef|Assign|AnnAssign I check it against the CST. To check against the CST I need to find that node in the CST. That's why I have the `scope` and `clauses` lists. Now to optimise the finding of that node within the CST I was thinking to use some sort of inverted index… symbol table

[02:32:31] <kuahara> is there any intuitive way to write out a numpy 4D array so that it is easy to tell, aside from bracket counting that you're looking at a 4D array?
[02:33:37] <kuahara> It seems there are rather obvious and elegant ways to write out 1, 2, and 3 dimensions.  After that it just looks sloppy.

[03:10:52] <parv> voldial, Interesting. # I have not used "sh" module, or don't remember non-blocking behaviour.
[03:10:58] <ChrisWarrick> voldial: if you want to run it interactively, I’d just subprocess.run(['mv', '-vi', a_path, b_path])
[03:11:30] <ChrisWarrick> voldial: also, I’d get rid of lines 15/16 by just doing a blank write to it, eg. a_path.write_bytes(b"")
[03:12:08] <ChrisWarrick> voldial: (unless you want the create-or-leave-as-is behavior, in which case it won’t help)
[03:12:33] <voldial> ChrisWarrick: thanks, but I'm trying to do this with sh, I have been down the subprocess route many times (https://github.com/jakeogh/run-command)
[03:12:57] <ChrisWarrick> okay, sure
[03:13:34] <ChrisWarrick> (although I believe `sh` to not really be necessary, and too encouraging of subprocess calls for my liking)
[03:13:58] <voldial> ChrisWarrick: yea, I try to not shell out as much as possible

[03:18:21] <voldial> ChrisWarrick: yea, but this is a ultra simple example, no special term stuff goint on, and a exit code hasnt been set, so .wait() is supposed to work.... reading code...

[03:19:34] <voldial> parv: if you are building apps that need to shell out often (in my case, it's a linux installer) then manually constructing subprocess calls becomes quite a bit of error prine work. sh has some really nice stuff, like .bake() for example.
[03:19:42] <parv> ChrisWarrick, In 's/subprocess/"&"/'? That is vim syntax to use the matched text in replacement; used here to quote "subprocess".

[06:53:49] <greeble> to the queue. when i run it though, it seems like my thread never actually executes. am i missing something really obvious?

[07:08:38] <greeble> yeah honestly this is one of my major misunderstandings about threading. ideally i want to be able to loop like "while len(queue) > 0 or len(active_threads) > 0" but i don't think i've found a clean way of managing that active thread count. not sure if a simple counter with a lock does the trick

[07:14:21] <MacGyver> Instead, where you're adding to the queue, just let the tasks submit subtasks as needed.
[07:14:56] <MacGyver> The thing you have to watch out for is you cannot let those tasks wait on a future from those submissions, but you're not doing that yet anyway.

[07:20:39] <MacGyver> One way to handle this self-growing list of tasks would be to add the futures returned by the submissions to a queue, loop waiting on *them*, and once there are no more uncompleted futures you can shutdown the executor. And handle the result as you see fit.

[11:03:38] <drew> when I make a virtualenv with `python -m virtualenv .`, then install beets with `pip install beets`, I can see that there is a binary for beets at ${virtualenv}/bin/beet, but if I do `which beet`, it still shows /usr/bin/beet is being used before the binary in my virtualenv
[11:04:03] <drew> is the virtualenv supposed to be changing my PATH so that the local bin is used before /usr/bin ?
[11:04:15] <TML> drew: Did you remember to activate the virtualenv?
[11:04:44] <drew> yes, I can see (beets) before my $PROMPT
[11:05:26] <InPhase> TML: Well, you made an integer division error.  Your last CURRENT_PAGE is 184, which is offset 920000 of limit 5000 meaning your last requested will be 925000 not 926047.
[11:05:26] <drew> and if I do `which pip`, for example, it shows ${virtualenv}/bin/pip
[11:05:33] <drew> so maybe this is something specific to beets?

[18:15:27] <kek_> so I ssh -X on my 2nd machine where I do some stuff with python. At some point I plot stuff and show it and I see it cause I forward X. Now after some time I keep getting "scripts/src/singleTestDataset.py:124: UserWarning: Matplotlib is currently using agg, which is a non-GUI backend, so cannot show the figure.". I don't see why it suddendly has an issue with the backend? maybe it changes? if so why?

[20:03:34] <grawity> so I guess make a habit of running yaml.dump(yaml.load(data)) to see if it goes through cleanly or not
[20:03:48] <nedbat> GitHub Actions use yaml, and the triggers are specified in an "on:" clause, so if you parse the file, you have to look for "True:" to know what triggers the action
[20:03:50] <grawity> or write the config in something else, like JSON, and "compile" it to YAML >_>

[22:16:21] <grym> "Since bytes objects are sequences of integers (akin to a tuple), for a bytes object b, b[0] will be an integer, while b[0:1] will be a bytes object of length 1. (This contrasts with text strings, where both indexing and slicing will produce a string of length 1)"
[22:16:22] <SamuelMarks> sabry / grym - Actually now that I think about it is in that category. Like a `t=({'a': []},)`… later: `l=list(t); l[0]['a'].append('foo')`  elsewhere: `l=list(t); print(l)`
[22:16:42] <SamuelMarks> that why my `l=list(deepcopy(t))` fixed the bug

[23:48:40] <grym> look, no files required :)
[23:48:45] <grym> just reach out and grab some data

[23:50:25] <lantech19446> that's pretty straightforward, what's the shell you're using for that?
[23:50:56] <deniska> ipython, but it doesn't provide much utility here besides numbering inputs and outputs
[23:51:04] <grym> lantech19446: that's ipython, it's not a shell
[23:51:18] <grym> it's a REPL that's fancier than what you get if you just type python RET
[23:51:24] <grym> but does the same thing
[23:51:30] <lantech19446> o ok
[23:52:01] <grym> for things that are not quite worth putting in a file of code to run :)

[23:53:55] <lantech19446> I need this in a file only because it gets run every day
[23:53:57] <deniska> these days I start with writing a script more often than not
[23:54:40] <deniska> "huh, that was useful, let's put it in a systemd service"

[23:55:14] <lantech19446> if only it were that simple, i work on a windoze network
[23:55:28] <grym> lantech19446: it's easy to plonk the result of a GET into a file
[23:55:48] <grym> and get it back with json.load(open(thatfile,'r'))

[23:57:42] <lantech19446> I've done it but the file I did it with is at work and i'm still so new it's hard to remember code lol
[23:57:59] <grym> well, that's what git is for
[23:58:05] <grym> and a personal notebook
[23:58:27] <grym> (which in my case also involves git, and a text file...)
[23:58:29] <deniska> or a printer

[23:58:42] <mattf> There is this horizontal line they use in things like stock graphs, representing what is the biggest weight or where have the price mostly visited and stayed at. Like resistance points. I think this concept can apply on my problem but i have no idea of what the name of this is. Given a signal like mine, and i want to classify it in between ground level and up, lets say i want to trace the ground level line and the up level lines, and
[23:58:42] <mattf> then from a sample of the graph check if the contributes more for the upper line or for the bottom line. What is the name of this
[23:58:42] <lantech19446> isn't it something like with open(contents, 'wb') as f: f.read or something
[23:58:43] <grym> hardcopy's fine too

[23:59:36] *** Quits: SamuelMarks (~samuel@user/samuelmarks) (Quit: leaving)
[23:59:44] <grym> there are many ways to obtain them
[23:59:56] <grym> mean +/- a std, the mode, more complicated statistics, ...
[23:59:56] <mattf> what is this even called
