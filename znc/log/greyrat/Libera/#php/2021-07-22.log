[00:01:00] <Sammitch> actually 137 isn't necessarily an OOMkill, just a KILL
[00:01:03] <biberu> could be Sammitch, just lowering it a bit appears to work
[00:01:15] <Sammitch> 3v4l might just be killing these because it's abusing resourrces
[00:01:20] <__adrian> ^
[00:01:34] <__adrian> be nice to 3v4l
[00:01:49] <Sammitch> if you want to benchmarrk something, 3v4l is about the worst possible choice
[00:01:58] <biberu> don't be 3v1l?
[00:02:06] <Sammitch> you want to _minimize_ the amount of other shit running in the background

[19:35:57] <celphi> np.
[19:36:14] <celphi> also 392 items in an array is small
[19:36:50] <celphi> so something else is going wrong with your laravel project @pmercado

[20:35:58] <stenno> empty block?
[20:36:18] <ramsey> it's not an expression, so it shouldn't evaluate to anything
[20:36:50] <ramsey> unless you mean `json_decode('[]')` and `json_decode('{}')`
[20:37:14] <ramsey> which makes sense, because `[]` is an empty array, while `{}` is a stdClass object
[20:38:05] <stenno> {} gets decoded to stdClass?
[20:38:15] <stenno> hmm wait wasn't there this assoc parameter for json_decode
[20:38:26] <ramsey> pass `true` as the second param
[20:38:29] <stenno> oh yeah, second param
[20:38:31] <stenno> yep
[20:39:17] <ramsey> https://3v4l.org/ReqD1#v8.0.8
[20:40:04] <stenno> ok and with second param both are the same as i would expect it

[20:42:24] <stenno> eh i'd need to create an account for that
[20:42:30] <ramsey> It's from Larry Garfield, so it's spicy but well-informed
[20:42:33] <stenno> i will read the blurb
[20:42:55] <stenno> i agree that php's array structure is... wonky
[20:42:55] <ramsey> He's given the talk multiple times, so you might be able to find another version of it on YouTube
[20:43:12] <stenno> wait iterables?
[20:43:14] <stenno> fair
[20:43:23] <stenno> i thought iterables was a more or less deprecated pattern in php
[20:43:46] <ramsey> Not from my understanding
[20:43:55] <ramsey> Generators are brand new, and they're iterables
[20:44:00] <stenno> ooh wait
[20:44:04] <ramsey> lots of things are iterables
[20:44:12] <stenno> i read up stuff about being able to compose iterators
[20:44:22] <stenno> but that was already in php 5.6 or so
[20:45:08] <celphi> uhm is the never use arrays thing like a trolling thing?
[20:45:36] <stenno> its more 'dont use arrays for everything'
[20:45:39] <ramsey> celphi: it sounds click-baity, but it's not
[20:46:30] <ramsey> it's a very informative talk with good, practical advice
[20:46:37] <celphi> like immediately im thinking there's like a million array_ functions why would i ever use anything otherwise
[20:47:02] <celphi> also array lookup has to be faster
[20:47:16] <ramsey> depends on how you're using it

[20:47:29] <celphi> meaning?
[20:47:35] <stenno> i am familiar with generators from javascript
[20:47:41] <da_wunder> also there is this - https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.ds.php
[20:48:00] <stenno> i saw that php has that concept too but when i looked at it it seemed to be implemented in a strange way
[20:48:11] <ramsey> Larry's basic premise is that using class properties is more efficient than using arrays as hash tables
[20:48:30] <ramsey> and this can be demonstrated through benchmarks
[20:48:36] <ramsey> go watch the talk
[20:48:46] <celphi> but there' sone thing he's missing
[20:48:52] <celphi> there's l1 l2 cache
[20:49:13] <celphi> objects dont store in a contiguous fashion in memory
[20:49:48] <stenno> wat
[20:49:52] <ramsey> I don't know enough about that to argue with you. Go watch the talk.
[20:50:04] <stenno> php abstracts memory management away
[20:50:34] <stenno> how does l1 l2 cache enter into it

[21:00:22] <stenno> celphi: are you maybe over-estimating your own knowledge regarding php
[21:02:26] <da_wunder> using $foo[] = 'bar'; is not wrong to add items to an array
