[00:35:34] <lz_> I feel you
[00:37:29] <lz_> lol "I am down 10k€ of personal funds since I switched full time on OCCT since I need more money to support my family"
[00:37:33] <lz_> https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/srhalz/linus_tech_tips_pirating_occt_answer_from_the_dev/
[00:39:26] <lz_> ol "Holy shit he's too nice."
[00:42:23] <hseg> So I'm having merge conflicts over both me and upstream adding different tables to a .dbml file. The .dbml itself is simple enough to merge, the .designer.cs was a bit more tricky, but the .dbml.layout looks like hell
[00:42:26] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: the power supply is the last part i have to design
[00:42:37] <hseg> but aren't the last two autogenerated?
[00:43:16] <hseg> judging by git{ignore,attributes} files I can find, the answer is apparently "not well enough"
[00:43:56] <GetShwifty> pretty sure dbml and designer are supposed to be auto generated
[00:44:26] <lz_> oh, from his username, I realize he's probably french
[00:44:45] <lz_> "iench" is "chien" in reverse, which means dog. "tetedeiench" means dog's face
[00:46:44] <hseg> hrm. but renaming the dbml.layout file away makes opening the dbml hang
[00:47:01] <Nasp> lz_:  Is there a tl;dr of that pirating post?
[00:47:03] <hseg> clearly there's more to it than just "oh, this gets autogenerated"
[00:47:31] <lz_> Nasp: linustech was using his software without knowing the "free" version wasn't for commercial use; he ended up apologizing and paying for a pro license
[00:47:37] <Nasp> A
[00:47:41] <Nasp> So sounds fair?
[00:47:45] <lz_> yep
[00:47:49] <Nasp> Or is there anything else than that
[00:47:55] <GetShwifty> guess dbml can go both ways
[00:47:59] <Nasp> Also didn't linus bitch about adblockers just recently
[00:48:00] <GetShwifty> it can be auto generated but it is also the bible
[00:48:00] <Nasp> And pirating
[00:48:08] <lz_> Nasp: the funny story is just how bad the dev is at marketing and selling stuff
[00:48:37] <lz_> Nasp: his software is the de facto standard of testing hardware and he's losing money on it
[00:48:54] <Nasp> Losing money?
[00:48:55] <Nasp> How
[00:49:08] <lz_> Nasp: he said it cost him 10k :D
[00:49:13] <Nasp> Yeah but how
[00:49:16] <lz_> right ?
[00:49:38] <Nasp> Kinda like those who says certain stuff costs them thousand of dolalrs a month to host
[00:49:41] <Nasp> And it's just the more plain content ever
[00:49:52] <lz_> I've been working for 5 years making exactly 0 money, but at least I know why
[00:49:54] <GetShwifty> its okay Nasp
[00:49:57] <GetShwifty> firefox is gonna save us
[00:50:02] <Nasp> From?
[00:50:04] <GetShwifty> by building spyware right into the browser
[00:50:06] <GetShwifty> ermm i mean
[00:50:12] <Nasp> Compared to chrome who doesn't?
[00:50:15] <Nasp> Compared to IE who doesn't?
[00:50:21] <GetShwifty> by building tools that promote privacy and ad / telemetry metrics standardization for publishers
[00:50:40] <Nasp> Those EU stuff regarding google analytics is interestin
[00:50:46] <Nasp> Same with that font ruling two weeks ago
[00:50:53] <GetShwifty> whats the font ruling?
[00:50:55] <GetShwifty> fonts are evil?
[00:50:59] <GetShwifty> or fonts should be paid for?
[00:51:06] <GetShwifty> EU could go either way
[00:51:26] <lz_> I created an account on epicgames; they asked for my id, I gave it to them. They answered my id wasn't valid (but it is) and then asked for my passport
[00:51:41] <lz_> maybe I should send them dick pics at this point
[00:51:51] <GetShwifty> Earlier this month, a German court fined an unidentified website €100 ($110, £84) for violating EU privacy law by importing a Google-hosted web font.
[00:51:52] <GetShwifty> lol
[00:52:24] <GetShwifty> The ruling directs the website to stop providing IP addresses to Google and threatens the site operator with a fine of €250,000 for each violation, or up to six months in prison, for continued improper use of Google Fonts.
[00:52:25] <GetShwifty> hahahah
[00:52:35] <Nasp> GetShwifty:  That google fonts are illegal
[00:52:41] <GetShwifty> dude
[00:52:43] <GetShwifty> thise is even funnier
[00:52:44] <Nasp> Not sure if external contents are illegal
[00:52:49] <GetShwifty> that ruling right there
[00:52:52] <Nasp> Or if someone's just pissed a google for anything really
[00:52:52] <GetShwifty> is saying external content
[00:52:56] <GetShwifty> exposes an ip address
[00:53:02] <lz_> privacy should be the default to fucking everything
[00:53:03] <GetShwifty> and thus is punishable by 250 k for each violation
[00:53:06] <Nasp> They say it like the website sent your ip address to google
[00:53:12] <Nasp> But in reality they didn't sent it
[00:53:12] <GetShwifty> what the actual haha god
[00:53:13] <GetShwifty> damn fuck
[00:53:42] <Nasp> Also it's only bad when google does it and other big companies
[00:53:43] <Nasp> Gov is okay
[00:54:06] <GetShwifty> i mean
[00:54:19] <GetShwifty> that's always been the mantra
[00:54:22] <GetShwifty> do as we say, not as we do
[00:54:53] <Nasp> Same with the cookie thing
[00:55:08] <Nasp> Could some adult please become a politician and fix these issues
[00:55:14] <lz_> I was using google maps today. when I entered a destination to reach, it "forgets" it even if I entered it 2 minutes earlier. Then it says "hey, if let us store all your data, we could remember your previous search"
[00:55:17] <Nasp> So i dont have to press accept 100 times a day
[00:55:31] <Nasp> lz_:  Come... join the dark side
[00:55:33] <lz_> I didn't even exit the app. It forgets "on purpose"
[00:55:47] <lz_> I really want to slap those google engineers in the face
[00:56:07] <Nasp> I think i've tried something similar
[00:56:15] <lz_> slapping them in the face?
[00:56:23] <Nasp> Also man, lets get some decent data protection rules instead of these bullshit ones
[00:57:36] <lz_> imo everything that can be self hosted *should* be self hosted, with possibly encrypted backups on the cloud. This should be the default of how internet works
[00:57:52] <lz_> google shouldn't know fuckshit about me
[00:58:19] <Nasp> So back to good old racks and datacenters?
[00:58:36] <Nasp> What i more mean lets add rules regarding data protection and privacy / tracking that makes sense
[00:59:00] <lz_> I wouldn't trust them to follow the law if it's not physically enforced
[00:59:39] <GetShwifty> Nasp, we called this session here to order with the sole purpose of how to make our big mega corporations/kings and queens more rich than their already super bizarre richness and also how to make people more reliant on this
[00:59:41] <lz_> gdpr is like asking a thief "so please tell me, what did you take from me? be honest plz"
[00:59:41] <JakeSays> Nasp: looks like raidz expansion is being released on freebsd. hopefully it'll come to linux soo
[00:59:45] <GetShwifty> your suggestions satisfy none fo those
[00:59:53] <Nasp> JakeSays:  About time :D
[00:59:58] <JakeSays> yup
[01:00:26] <Nasp> Last update i have is from june 2021
[01:00:41] <Nasp> Ohh it was actually merged https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/pull/8853
[01:00:42] <GetShwifty> JakeSays:  you using ZFS on *nix?
[01:00:54] <JakeSays> GetShwifty: zfs only runs on *nix, so yes
[01:01:05] <GetShwifty> ?
[01:01:11] <JakeSays> Nasp: yeah. the update i read was from a couple of days ago
[01:01:12] <Nasp> I wouldn't be surprised if there was some bastard port to Windows
[01:01:15] <GetShwifty> pretty zfs runs on solaris, bsd and nix
[01:01:16] <Nasp> Where half your files dissapeared
[01:01:20] <GetShwifty> and there is a very unstable windows port
[01:01:25] <JakeSays> GetShwifty: solaris, bsd are both *nix
[01:01:31] <GetShwifty> alright
[01:01:35] <GetShwifty> then lket me rephrase for the pedantic
[01:01:41] <GetShwifty> are you running ZFS on a linux distro
[01:01:41] <JakeSays> the windows port doesn't count
[01:01:42] <Nasp> JakeSays:  But like we talked about before it's more of a home issue
[01:01:46] <JakeSays> GetShwifty: yes
[01:01:53] <Nasp> For productivtions systems it might be better to not expand but duplicate vdevs instead
[01:01:56] <Nasp> Since it's a bit safer
[01:01:57] <GetShwifty> cool, you use auto snapshots any ?
[01:02:29] <JakeSays> i was going to but haven't finished setting things up like i want
[01:02:34] <JakeSays> (it's been two years now..)
[01:02:59] <GetShwifty> lol i know how that is
[01:03:19] <GetShwifty> if/when i DO have to rebuild my ZFS storage i really kind of wanna move away from freenas , but i wanna keep the ZFS
[01:03:30] <GetShwifty> but i use (/abuse) auto snapshots
[01:03:39] <Nasp> What do you want to use insteaD?
[01:03:48] <GetShwifty> would rather use anything else tbh
[01:03:49] <JakeSays> that's easy to do - just run freebsd or linux
[01:03:56] <GetShwifty> my experience with free nas has been not that stellar
[01:04:09] <GetShwifty> its basically a .. get it working.. and then don't touch it, don't breath on it, don't upgrade it..
[01:04:22] <Nasp> GetShwifty:  Truenas then? :D
[01:04:25] <GetShwifty> lol
[01:04:33] <GetShwifty> that's the controverisal split right?
[01:04:45] <Nasp> That's just the newer Linux based version
[01:04:53] <GetShwifty> oh
[01:04:54] <GetShwifty> ok
[01:05:01] <GetShwifty> i thought they were just going under the OpenZFS umbrella
[01:05:10] <GetShwifty> or is that FreeNAS software running on Linux?
[01:05:17] <GetShwifty> (including openzfs)
[01:05:37] <hseg> wtf designs an ide feature where an autogenerated file a) cannot be regenerated and b) if absent, kills the ide?
[01:05:46] *** Quits: xb0o2 (~xb0o2@user/xb0o2) (Quit: Leaving)
[01:05:57] <GetShwifty> lol the people who built VS 2013- 2022
[01:05:58] <DoofusCanadensis> Microsoft?
[01:06:12] <GetShwifty> i feel ms deliberate started sabotaging vs 2022 on windows 7
[01:06:23] <GetShwifty> with latest preview 4+ update
[01:06:24] <hseg> fml
[01:06:33] <DoofusCanadensis> Windows 7 is no longer supports so I wouldn't blame them
[01:06:41] <GetShwifty> that's no reason toi deliberately sabotage
[01:06:50] <GetShwifty> but if you're a piss on everybody that isn't following and doing exactly what you do
[01:06:58] <GetShwifty> yeah go right fucking ahead with that mentality
[01:07:21] <hseg> i wouldn't care about the dbml.layout being important to vs, except it causes merge conflicts
[01:07:34] <hseg> i mean, it's not even as if I can sanely layout my db
[01:07:37] <GetShwifty> yeah i don't like db design in source control tbh hseg
[01:08:23] <DoofusCanadensis> db design (schema) should be in source control, but do it consistently if you are keeping it there
[01:08:35] <hseg> except not having it in vcs means vs will hang if I try to open the .dbml
[01:08:39] <hseg> ... actually...
[01:08:51] <GetShwifty> lol
[01:08:58] <lz_> have you tried using a text file instead of a db
[01:09:10] <GetShwifty> how does not having it in vcs means it will hang?
[01:09:22] <GetShwifty> oh, as in it wouldn't be there
[01:09:45] <hseg> exactly
[01:10:07] <GetShwifty> well expanding on that i dislike db management solutions that stem from .dbml related sources of truth :D
[01:11:37] <hseg> wtf the schema couldn't be an artifact separate from both the db and the project that the two depend on, i have no idea
[01:12:19] <hseg> ok, so turns out emptying the dbml.layout but leaving it in place leaves the system mostly functional
[01:12:41] <GetShwifty> lol
[01:15:36] <Nasp> GetShwifty:  It is
[01:16:10] <Nasp> Also VS seems like it's just going from worse to worse
[01:16:12] <hseg> ok, situation is actually a little worse than I thought. grep class DataLayer/DB.designer.cs | wc -l shows I have ~700 classes
[01:16:27] <GetShwifty> yeah
[01:16:30] <Nasp> Why do you have designer?
[01:16:39] <GetShwifty> wish i had a usable W10 machine that was walled from the internet that i could throw VS 2022 on
[01:16:50] <GetShwifty> so i could verify my suspicion on whether ms is sabotaging VS 2022 specifically for windows 7 machines
[01:17:01] <Nasp> I remember it used to take me 20-30 minute to autogen that stuff and that was years ago, haven't used it since
[01:17:16] <GetShwifty> or whether the same 32-bit service hub consuming more than 3.2gb / constant crashing/spawning of servicehub controller exists on windows 10 too lol
[01:17:16] <Nasp> GetShwifty:  Get one of thse W10 long term service build
[01:17:22] <hseg> because that's the way I know to get C# talking with my db?
[01:17:28] <GetShwifty> i dont have any spare machine to put it on Nasp
[01:17:34] <Nasp> hseg:  Can't you go code first?
[01:17:39] <Nasp> GetShwifty:  Go for a VM?
[01:17:39] <hseg> while keeping their schemas more or less in sync
[01:17:53] <hseg> Nasp: how would I do that?
[01:18:00] <GetShwifty> the goal is trying to run VS 202 on solutions containg 50+ projects :D
[01:18:23] <hseg> also, you forget I'm at $DAYJOB, where we have 5y of crufty technical burden
[01:18:42] <GetShwifty> then buck up, and start merging, one line at a time
[01:18:42] <GetShwifty> lol
[01:19:05] <hseg> fuck it, am adding *.dbml.layout binary to .gitattributes and calling it a day
[01:19:17] *** Quits: hseg (~hseg@195.192.226.33) (Remote host closed the connection)
[01:19:19] <lz_> I want a tl;dr of what remains of my life and be done with it
[01:19:25] <lz_> it fucking sucks
[01:19:35] <GetShwifty> you know the most annoying thing about Entity Framework
[01:19:36] *** Joins: hseg (~hseg@195.192.226.33)
[01:19:59] <GetShwifty> is that i'm not really aware of anybody that has even remotely come close to building something that competes with it, let alone actually solves so many of the problems that it has
[01:20:00] <hseg> ,,, didn't know my computer would take it that personally
[01:20:05] <GetShwifty> lmao hseg :D
[01:20:12] <Nasp> hseg:  Hold old is your coebase and is it framework?
[01:20:15] <GetShwifty> WE JUST THOUGHT YOu WERE /S ing lmao
[01:20:17] <Nasp> I assume it's old
[01:20:31] *** Quits: hseg (~hseg@195.192.226.33) (Remote host closed the connection)
[01:20:32] <GetShwifty> or something
[01:20:39] <JakeSays> i think ef sucks.
[01:20:41] *** Joins: hseg (~hseg@195.192.226.33)
[01:20:43] <GetShwifty> it does
[01:20:50] <JakeSays> linq2db is much better
[01:20:52] <GetShwifty> so horrid to do shit in
[01:20:53] <Nasp> JakeSays:  NAh it's just you
[01:20:58] <hseg> gdi pc, can we not crash when we're having nice conversations?

[01:21:14] <Nasp> Also performance or feature wise?
[01:21:25] <GetShwifty> i am honestly not a fan of linq 2 db
[01:21:29] <hseg> codebase dates to 2017, apparently has changed a couple of hands, I'm the freshest on the team, started a month ago
[01:21:38] <GetShwifty> i feel it falls under the realm of 'fringe orm' that fails to compete with EF
[01:21:57] <GetShwifty> and fails to solve most of the problems while adding it's own religion of 'how you do things'
[01:22:05] <JakeSays> GetShwifty: from my perspective it beats ef in every category i consider important
[01:22:12] <GetShwifty> i get that
[01:22:21] <GetShwifty> i built my own ORM that i know is horrid but basically does that
[01:22:27] <Nasp> GetShwifty:  Remember it's Linq2Db not Linq2sql
[01:22:32] <GetShwifty> yes GetShwifty i know
[01:22:33] <Nasp> They are often mixed up
[01:22:56] <Nasp> hseg:  And they decided to go with designer? Do you use UI For adding new tables
[01:23:10] <Nasp> JakeSays:  What categories do you consider important
[01:23:34] <JakeSays> Nasp: performance and ease of use.
[01:24:05] <hseg> nope, afaict workflow for adding new tables is "add them directly in ssms, then drag them into the c# codebase via designer, and slap any additional features necessary in partial classes"
[01:24:08] <Nasp> I dont know about performance
[01:24:17] *** Quits: nwulfe (~wulfe@cpe-174-103-156-213.cinci.res.rr.com) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[01:24:23] <Nasp> Not often there's proper benchmarks against the different toolsets
[01:24:32] <GetShwifty> yeah nasp and even when they do
[01:24:34] <Nasp> But i'd wish the EF team would start adding more features
[01:24:35] <GetShwifty> they ignore the important stuff
[01:24:39] <Nasp> They seem to really just dick around
[01:24:42] <GetShwifty> like the last time i benchmarked EF
[01:24:46] <Nasp> I want to delete stuff without needing to get it
[01:24:50] <Nasp> and update the same way
[01:24:55] <Nasp> Without needing weird extensions
[01:24:56] <GetShwifty> EF was only about 2x slower than my method, which was about 1.5 x slower than straight DR/DS
[01:25:00] <GetShwifty> HOWEVER
[01:25:00] <Nasp> So in that reegards sure
[01:25:04] <JakeSays> i dont want code first, migrations, state tracking.. all of that shit just gets in the way.
[01:25:11] <GetShwifty> in terms of time spent by the CPU
[01:25:37] <GetShwifty> EF used 9x  as much cpu time as my ORM which used about 10-50% more  cpu than straight DR/DS
[01:25:39] <Nasp> Hmm i dont find that migration gets in the way
[01:25:53] <GetShwifty> .
[01:26:01] <Nasp> EF is like at same performance as dapper now
[01:26:15] <GetShwifty> again i actually don't care about time performance
[01:26:19] <GetShwifty> i care more about cpu performance
[01:26:36] <GetShwifty> and to a lesser exteent (beacuse usually your cpu performance tells you if the memory profiling is all fucked up)
[01:26:37] <JakeSays> GetShwifty: dude.. they're the same thing.
[01:26:40] <GetShwifty> no
[01:26:44] <GetShwifty> they are not
[01:26:51] <GetShwifty> not when you're dealing with I/O bound shit
[01:26:59] <GetShwifty> (3:54:56 PM) GetShwifty: EF was only about 2x slower than my method, which was about 1.5 x slower than straight DR/DS  EF used 9x  as much cpu time as my ORM which used about 10-50% more  cpu than straight DR/DS
[01:27:08] <GetShwifty> so Entity Framework took ONLY twice as long
[01:27:13] <GetShwifty> but it consumed 90% of the CPU
[01:27:20] <GetShwifty> actually that was 90% vs 5% vs 5%
[01:27:40] <GetShwifty> but yeah it during the cpu profiling it took up 90% of the CPU
[01:27:43] <JakeSays> all of the io is done with ado.net. everything in an orm is cpu overhead
[01:27:46] <GetShwifty> doing the exact same thing
[01:27:57] <GetShwifty> exactly
[01:28:21] <lz_> how many people will die attempting to go to mars do you think
[01:28:26] <GetShwifty> and the performance problem doesnt always manifest itself in taking longer time, but may manifest itself in consuming way more cpu cycles
[01:28:31] <JakeSays> lz_: 42
[01:28:39] <Nasp> lz_:  The first maybe?
[01:28:45] <GetShwifty> which matters when yhou're talking about scaling
[01:28:48] <lz_> Nasp: he won't be alone though
[01:28:53] <Nasp> Didn't people volunteer for one way trip
[01:29:00] <JakeSays> Nasp: yeah
[01:29:11] <Nasp> That also solves the return problem
[01:29:14] <JakeSays> if i were 30 years younger i would've definitely volunteered
[01:29:24] <lz_> that's the kind of stuff I want to know before I die
[01:29:33] <Nasp> Yeah especially if you could be the firs
[01:29:46] <lz_> also I want to know about some progress with particle physics
[01:30:12] <JakeSays> life on mars is going to be very difficult for many generations, if not forever
[01:30:16] <lz_> it's been almost stuck for 50 years now
[01:30:39] <JakeSays> lz_: i want to see fusion power before i die
[01:30:40] <GetShwifty> ther'es a joke about permanent quarantine in a bubble iun there
[01:30:51] <Nasp> JakeSays:  why though?
[01:30:56] <JakeSays> Nasp: why what?
[01:30:59] <Nasp> Why fusion
[01:31:08] <Nasp> And will fusion really change anything
[01:31:14] <JakeSays> because it's the solution to the world's energy situation
[01:31:20] <Nasp> And fission is not?
[01:31:27] <JakeSays> it isn't
[01:31:42] <Nasp> ARe we talking waste wise or?
[01:31:50] <Nasp> Because many also believe it will generate much more power
[01:32:06] *** Quits: hseg (~hseg@195.192.226.33) (Remote host closed the connection)
[01:32:07] <JakeSays> fusion will generate way more power, and with no waste
[01:32:10] <Nasp> Also everybody knows that windmills are the future
[01:32:16] <JakeSays> lol
[01:32:34] <Nasp> Sure fusion is more efficient in that way, but an actual plant wont output more power
[01:32:44] <JakeSays> huh?
[01:32:47] <GetShwifty> everybody knows humans not using any water / eletricity is the TRUE solution to our energy and water crisis
[01:32:58] <irwiss> there's like 100 kinds of perpetual motion machines on youtube, they're definitely the future!
[01:33:05] <JakeSays> irwiss: LOL
[01:33:20] <Nasp> Like there's still a limit to how much power we can actually convert, so it's not like the actual more efficiency we get out of fusion will translate to a 1-1 ratio in power output (electrical)
[01:33:22] <lz_> wouldn't it be nice if we found a way to trigger vacuum decay
[01:33:31] <Nasp> GetShwifty: Save the environment, kill your neighbors
[01:33:41] <GetShwifty> lol
[01:33:50] <irwiss> lz_: yeah it'd be nice to have a ZPM
[01:33:51] <JakeSays> Nasp: fusion generates way more power than fusion
[01:33:53] <lz_> it would be super nice except we wouldn't even know before it happens
[01:34:06] <JakeSays> er fission

[01:34:16] <GetShwifty> (in theory?)
[01:34:17] <Nasp> JakeSays: Yes but do you really believe it will mean we get more actual electrical power out of a plant?
[01:34:26] <JakeSays> Nasp: absolutely
[01:34:29] <Nasp> How come?
[01:34:35] <irwiss> altrenatively some microverse batteries
[01:34:41] <GetShwifty> Mmmm
[01:34:46] <GetShwifty> i could get into that
[01:34:48] <Nasp> Anyways fusion is still a dream
[01:34:51] <JakeSays> Nasp: is said wy - fusion generates way more power
[01:34:55] <Nasp> For now we need to go with traditional nuclear power
[01:35:08] <GetShwifty> are we building more nuclear powe plants than we're decomissioning?
[01:35:20] <lz_> irwiss: imagine one nation would actually have such a device that could end reality :D they would be able to ask for anything to anyone, it'd be fun
[01:35:28] <lz_> "can i have ukraine plz"
[01:35:32] <Nasp> JakeSays:  Yes for the fuel you put in
[01:35:44] <Nasp> But i dont believe we will replace nuclear powerplants that output 100x as much energy
[01:35:58] <Nasp> GetShwifty:  I dunno, i just know we arent building any
[01:36:05] <GetShwifty> ultimately the real problem is less the  generation of electricity
[01:36:08] <Nasp> We are planning to build 15 times as many windmills as we have now
[01:36:10] <GetShwifty> and more the distribution of that which we generate
[01:36:23] <irwiss> lz_: if you mean as in military power i don't think that's gonna change much, the current military poles can already guarantee a MAD scenario for any global wa
[01:36:24] <Nasp> So our electricity prices and get even more fucked when the wind isn't blowing
[01:36:25] <irwiss> war*
[01:36:40] <GetShwifty> at least according to some web video that was published on youtube by somebody who purported to be an energy expert
[01:37:00] <lz_> irwiss: true; except in the case I was mentioning only 1 nation would have it
[01:37:20] <lz_> irwiss: but yeah you could imagine a world with only 1 nation with nukes; would be the same
[01:37:23] <irwiss> yeah but other nations will just throw regular nukes and call it a day "{
[01:37:26] <irwiss> :P
[01:37:26] <JakeSays> Nasp: fusion gives you 4x more power and zero nuclear waste. that is enough for me.
[01:37:51] <Nasp> JakeSays:  I'm just saying that doesnt' necesarily translate into 4x electrical output
[01:38:06] <Nasp> Anyways for now, fision is what we need to go for
[01:38:12] <Nasp> Buy ourself 50-100 years
[01:38:18] <irwiss> there's probably enough nukes on subs right now to cover most population-dense areas in a nice pattern of radioactive deserts
[01:38:22] <Nasp> And i dont believe i will see viable fusion
[01:38:29] <Nasp> So i dont believe you will either :D
[01:38:32] <JakeSays> Nasp: i dont see the relevance. just the waste issue alone is enough. the extra power is icing
[01:38:32] <lz_> irwiss: vacuum decay is a hypothetical thing where vacuum isn't at its true vacuum state; triggering it would be a sort of wave that propagates at the speed of light, and would completely change physics as we know it; we'd just sort of instantly disappear into other particles or something
[01:38:55] <Nasp> Lets build a dyson sphere!
[01:39:42] <lz_> irwiss: maybe it's ALREADY happening and coming to us from somewhere in the universe :D and we'd never know
[01:39:48] <JakeSays> lz_: i'm not sure i find the prospect of instantly disappearing in to other particles appealing
[01:40:03] <irwiss> ehh... we can barely build a solar plant before politicians start screaming bloody murder :P
[01:40:15] <JakeSays> irwiss: true that
[01:40:16] <Nasp> Also we need a better way to generate power from heat
[01:40:21] <Nasp> It's a horrible conversion
[01:40:22] <GetShwifty> every time you build a solar plant you're murdering a sun!
[01:40:30] <JakeSays> wind is now getting a bad rep for being "ugly"
[01:40:37] <Nasp> Wind is horrible
[01:40:38] <GetShwifty> you can't just steal the solar's free energy and use it for your own profit!
[01:40:51] <lz_> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_vacuum_decay#Existential_threat
[01:41:01] <GetShwifty> wind is a great supplementary , ignoring all the bird killings and broken turbines
[01:41:04] <GetShwifty> it is not a great primary
[01:41:15] <lz_> "the full destruction of baryonic matter[10] or even immediate gravitational collapse of the universe"
[01:41:19] <lz_> music to my ears
[01:41:30] <GetShwifty> wind really requires a great storage mechanism or efficienty mass delivery network
[01:41:53] <irwiss> lz_: unlikely to happen in next 10 generations and we won't feel anything before we die so fuck it :P
[01:41:55] <JakeSays> i think wind is perfect for the oceans
[01:42:02] <JakeSays> in those places where it always blows
[01:42:12] <Nasp> GetShwifty:  We are planning to make methanol or something else i can't currently remember from wind energy
[01:42:15] <lz_> irwiss: wouldn't it be the best way to go though
[01:42:19] <GetShwifty> if you're in the ocean, then better to actually go under water and harness tide
[01:42:23] <GetShwifty> 100x more power
[01:42:28] <Nasp> And dump it into airplanes so our prime minister can fly to Brussel and brag to the other politicians down there
[01:42:39] <Nasp> At the expensive of everyones electricity price sky rocketing
[01:42:40] <GetShwifty> but that requires efficient delivery mechanism if you're on a massive land locked contiennt
[01:42:43] <JakeSays> GetShwifty: yeah there's a ton of potential in tidal power
[01:42:59] <JakeSays> iirc there are a few companies trying to commercialize it
[01:43:03] <GetShwifty> yeah
[01:43:08] <GetShwifty> they've been trying it for 20 years
[01:43:17] <GetShwifty> think there was something that was supposedly go in florida shore. a few in UK
[01:43:28] <GetShwifty> not sure what they all panned out to. last i heard major delays / etc
[01:43:35] <JakeSays> i built a tidal power generator when i was a kid.
[01:43:50] <JakeSays> except the "tide" was just waves on the lake where i lived
[01:43:55] <GetShwifty> it's upu there in 'i don't think it makes sense  to big corporations agenda so it gets fought until it's either too expensive or banned
[01:43:55] <JakeSays> but it was fun
[01:44:05] <Nasp> If i owned a house i would try to go energy neutral
[01:44:07] <GetShwifty> *I think it's up in the
[01:44:18] <Nasp> Not for the climate, but because energy is fucking expensive and it only gets worse
[01:44:45] <GetShwifty> well if you dont have a/c
[01:44:47] <lz_> one depressing thing is, I'm afraid there's nothing humans can do with physics than the universe isn't already doing. it all boils down to crashing particles at very high speed and the universe is already doing that with gamma ray and all, and nothing really exciting is happening
[01:44:48] <GetShwifty> and can go solar heater
[01:44:55] <GetShwifty> that's generaly 33-50% of your energy costs right there
[01:44:59] <GetShwifty> *solar water heater
[01:45:14] <lz_> even black holes are not as fun as we could hope they would be
[01:45:27] <GetShwifty> be nice to build huge apartment complexes that were very energy efficient / green in that manner
[01:45:28] <JakeSays> GetShwifty: "if you don't have a/c" - that is not an option.
[01:45:34] <GetShwifty> he's in europe
[01:45:39] <GetShwifty> i literally said that because Nasp is in europe
[01:45:40] <GetShwifty> lol
[01:45:52] <GetShwifty> Nasp
[01:45:53] <JakeSays> i wouldn't care where i was - ac is a must
[01:45:56] <GetShwifty> what's your monthly electricity cost
[01:46:02] <GetShwifty> same JakeSays
[01:46:08] <lz_> if you could create a black hole with some particle accelerator, it would immediately collapse on itself and disappear
[01:46:17] <lz_> ending reality is hard
[01:46:48] <lz_> can't even crash the moon on the earth with a billion rockets
[01:47:14] <JakeSays> not sure why that would be a goal
[01:47:20] <GetShwifty> what?
[01:47:25] <GetShwifty> energy neutral?

[01:48:48] <Nasp> Or geothermal
[01:49:01] <GetShwifty> when you say electrical hearer do you mean tankless?
[01:49:15] <Nasp> JakeSays:  AC is expensive
[01:49:27] <Nasp> Electricity power have doubles during the last 6 months due to stupid windmills
[01:49:30] <GetShwifty> Nasp
[01:49:36] <GetShwifty> what is your average monthly electrical bill
[01:50:27] <Nasp> 600 dollars i think
[01:50:33] <JakeSays> holy fuck
[01:50:35] <GetShwifty> holy christ on a fucking crutch
[01:50:50] <GetShwifty> lol
[01:50:53] <GetShwifty> mines 200$
[01:50:54] <lz_> Nasp: so I guess you're not mining bitcoins?
[01:50:59] <GetShwifty> and thats me running the A/C at night to 68/67
[01:51:10] <JakeSays> mine is like $70/mo in the winter, and can hit $180 in the summer with ac
[01:51:10] <GetShwifty> i still think my energy company is bilking some numbers but can't really prove it
[01:51:20] <GetShwifty> yeah mine is supposed to be 119$ a month
[01:51:21] <Nasp> GetShwifty:  And how big is your house?
[01:51:22] <GetShwifty> i dont trust the 200$
[01:51:25] <JakeSays> Nasp: that's just crazy
[01:51:27] <Nasp> Also that's without AC and washer / dryer
[01:51:28] <GetShwifty> my apt is 1100~ sq ft
[01:51:34] <GetShwifty> yeah nasp
[01:51:35] <Nasp> Which is probably some of the bigger power hogs
[01:51:37] <lz_> Nasp: isn't solar panels an option at this price? with some tesla walls
[01:51:38] <GetShwifty> thats why i said "holy christ on a crutch"
[01:51:46] <Nasp> MY electricity bill used to be 300
[01:51:48] <GetShwifty> i have A/C/ Washer dryer AND i take at least one shower a day lol
[01:52:02] <JakeSays> Nasp: you don't have a washer/dryer?
[01:52:13] <Nasp> Well shower isn't electrical powerd so that's not even in that price
[01:52:20] <Nasp> I have another bill for heating and water
[01:52:21] <GetShwifty> shower empties your water heater
[01:52:22] <Nasp> JakeSays:  No
[01:52:34] <JakeSays> that would suck
[01:52:36] <GetShwifty> and we're all electrical here
[01:52:39] <Nasp> It does
[01:52:51] <JakeSays> the w/d is the only thing i really cared about in the divorce. lol
[01:52:53] <Nasp> Electrical water heaters are quite uncommon here
[01:52:54] <DoofusCanadensis> europe?
[01:52:57] <GetShwifty> lmao JakeSays
[01:52:57] <Nasp> BEcause it would be too expensive
[01:52:58] <lz_> same, all electrical and my bill is maybe 100eur. and I think it's too expensive
[01:53:01] <GetShwifty> yeah
[01:53:08] <GetShwifty> gas is more efficient but .. ugg gas
[01:53:18] <Nasp> Gas is getting phased out as well
[01:53:19] <DoofusCanadensis> Canada: water and heat are both natural gas powered
[01:53:21] <Nasp> Due to climate
[01:53:31] <JakeSays> GetShwifty: especially since they were a very expensive gift forced upon us by her mother.
[01:53:37] <lz_> at 600 I'd buy a bike and generate electricity myself
[01:53:52] <Nasp> There's a reason people want solar on their houses here
[01:53:57] <Nasp> But the rules regarding those have changed
[01:54:03] <Nasp> Else everybody used to put them on their newly built house
[01:54:17] <Nasp> Because you could get some tax exemtions and money back when you generated more power than you used
[01:54:27] <Nasp> But both of those deals have kinda gotten away
[01:54:32] <lz_> why was it a bad thing then?
[01:54:37] <Nasp> It iwasn't
[01:55:03] <Nasp> If those rules were still there we would have had 10x more solar
[01:55:15] <Nasp> But gov doesn't want private people to have solar
[01:55:30] <JakeSays> why not?
[01:55:37] <lz_> Nasp: then it's time to do some DIY small nuclear plants
[01:55:44] <JakeSays> lz_: LOL
[01:55:46] <Nasp> I have no idea, they want companies to own it intead and make money on it
[01:55:49] <lz_> I heard it wasn't that hard, there was a student who did one iirc
[01:56:17] <Nasp> Solar was just a natural thing before
[01:56:19] <Nasp> And then it got killed
[01:56:23] <JakeSays> permitting issues would be a concern i would think
[01:56:24] <Nasp> Same with the eletrical car
[01:56:28] <Nasp> That got killed as well
[01:56:35] <DoofusCanadensis> lobbyists
[01:56:44] <lz_> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hahn
[01:56:47] <Nasp> WE could encourage people to make solar or buy electrical
[01:56:57] <Nasp> But those incensives were removed and just force more taxes on people instead
[01:57:33] <lz_> nvm he didn't get to finish his reactor :D
[01:57:50] <JakeSays> lz_: or his life it appears
[01:58:23] <Nasp> "His death was ruled an accidental result of intoxication from the combined effects of alcohol, diphenhydramine, and fentanyl."
[01:58:26] <Nasp> Somebody had a party
[01:58:31] <GetShwifty> lol
[01:58:33] <lz_> Nasp: lol yeah I was gonna paste this line exactly :D
[01:58:36] <lz_> "accidental"
[01:58:38] <lz_> that's just a suicide
[01:59:12] <Nasp> Yeah it actually is
[01:59:26] <Nasp> diphenhydramine is an antihista mine it seems
[01:59:31] <JakeSays> lz_: "On June 26, 1995, the EPA, having designated Hahn's mother's property a Superfund hazardous materials cleanup site, dismantled the shed and its contents and buried them as low-level radioactive waste in Utah." - ROFL!!
[01:59:39] <Nasp> Used for insominia and codls, wtf
[01:59:52] <lz_> if he knew how to build a nuclear reactor I'm pretty sure he also knew how to die
[01:59:59] <Nasp> Ahh it's Benadryl
[02:00:24] <Nasp> But i have a feeling it's the alcohol and especially fentanul
[02:00:27] <JakeSays> man, how cool would it be to have your shed declared a superfund site
[02:00:41] <Nasp> Ohh yeah don't go into the shed, it's kinda radioactive
[02:00:46] <JakeSays> Nasp: lol yeah my money is on the fentanyl
[02:01:07] <Nasp> Isn't that what you mix into drugs to get an extra kick out of it
[02:01:11] <JakeSays> the town i grew up in is a superfund site
[02:01:23] <JakeSays> Nasp: fentanyl?
[02:01:26] <Nasp> Yes
[02:01:47] <JakeSays> it's an opioid many many times stronger than heroin
[02:02:09] <Nasp> One of my friends aunt or something made one of those super fund site. And his sister or is cleaning it up in the company she works for
[02:02:17] <lz_> wait there's another one : "[Taylor] Wilson is best known for producing nuclear fusion in 2008 when he was 14 years old, and for his work to design and develop modular power reactor technology"
[02:02:19] <Nasp> So they kind argue when they meet for family gatherings
[02:02:26] <lz_> no excuse for your electricity bill Nasp
[02:02:29] <JakeSays> "Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is 80-100 times stronger than morphine."
[02:02:36] <Nasp> "Well that's how we used to do it back in the day drive it out to a dumsite near a beach and dump it all"
[02:02:44] <Nasp> JakeSays:  Yeah but dont they mix it with heroin
[02:03:07] <JakeSays> well, i prefer to avoid it
[02:03:17] <Nasp> Fentanyl or heroin?
[02:03:21] <Nasp> :D
[02:03:29] <JakeSays> both
[02:04:03] <Nasp> Also i wonder if those small nuclear reactor is really good for anything
[02:04:15] <lz_> only one way to find out
[02:04:46] <JakeSays> you know fentanyl is bad when heroin is considered its gateway drug. lol

[02:05:35] <Nasp> lz_: The idea is cool, but their energy output seems quite small
[02:05:38] <Nasp> I want Jigga watts
[02:05:45] <lz_> for those bitcoins
[02:06:11] <lz_> I'm surprised this isn't a news story already
[02:06:21] <lz_> "student arrested for creating a nuclear reactor to mine bitcoins"
[02:06:22] <Nasp> I want a way to eliminate Thermal -> Water -> Steam -> mechanical -> electrical
[02:06:50] <Nasp> I was so dissapointed when i was younger and found our a nuclear power plant was really just a giant steam machine
[02:07:27] <lz_> Nasp: what I don't get is why we don't have "gravity" energy storage; something really heavy that we elevate, and let it fall to retrieve the energy
[02:07:42] <lz_> I think there's already some centrifugal things that store energy in rotating masses
[02:07:47] <JakeSays> apparently some guy in texas built his own reactor and it was declared legal
[02:08:02] <JakeSays> it seems to be legal in all 50 states
[02:08:22] <JakeSays> or more accurately not deemed illegal
[02:08:22] <lz_> it seems simple enough, doesn't sound like an engineering nightmare eventhough it probably is
[02:08:35] <Nasp> lz_:  I saw something like ethat the other day
[02:08:58] <lz_> I think they do this with some lakes
[02:10:27] <irwiss> lz_: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity
[02:10:36] <Nasp> Can't find it out, but someone made a tower where it lifted up and down some heavy barrels
[02:10:39] <irwiss> water is really heavy and you "lift" it with pumps
[02:10:56] <lz_> irwiss: ah yes, I think I've seen some youtube video about it; maybe Tom Scott
[02:11:07] <Nasp> But yes we need better batteries as well
[02:11:12] <Nasp> Ahh that might be it

[02:13:00] <Nasp> It looks rather dum
[02:13:12] <Nasp> I would still think water is easier
[02:14:14] <GetShwifty> JakeSays:  i mean GE for a while was actively pursuing consumer nuclear reactors to sell to the public
[02:14:15] <GetShwifty> :D
[02:14:20] <GetShwifty> not sdure if they still are
[02:14:30] <Nasp> Also flywheels seems to come back in fashion
[02:14:33] <Nasp> And it just feels wrong in a way
[02:14:52] <lz_> Nasp: water's density isn't that big though; works fine with a lake because there are tons of it, but otherwise it's probably not "volume" efficient
[02:15:34] <lz_> concrete is 2.5x the density; still not very heavy
[02:16:16] <lz_> I wonder if I messed up with the units
[02:16:31] <lz_> hmm not that seems to be it
[02:17:01] <JakeSays> GetShwifty: so was Chrysler
[02:17:37] <GetShwifty> doesnt surprise me lol
[02:17:55] <GetShwifty> didnt somebody wanna put a nuclear reactor in a car?
[02:17:59] <GetShwifty> or was that Chrysler?
[02:18:10] <Nasp> Anyways Nuclear fission is the only viable way right now
[02:18:16] <Nasp> I dont see any other alternatives
[02:18:32] <Nasp> I'm not saying we can't combine, but wind / solar always comees up short
[02:18:41] <JakeSays> GetShwifty: that ways chrysler.
[02:18:43] <JakeSays> *was
[02:18:46] <GetShwifty> kay
[02:18:54] <GetShwifty> Solar / wind are great supplementary Nasp
[02:18:59] <GetShwifty> but that's all they should be
[02:19:00] <Nasp> Yes supplementary
[02:19:19] <JakeSays> i think it depends on location.
[02:19:39] <Nasp> Also still not sure if i'm a fan of that produce methanol from excess power idea
[02:19:45] <GetShwifty> i mean it's always night for 8 hours every day in most places where solar is viable
[02:19:47] <Nasp> Not saying it's not a good idea, but it sounds like we are far from it
[02:19:47] <JakeSays> the western US has a shit load of land for such things
[02:19:57] <Nasp> Land for windmills?
[02:19:58] <GetShwifty> and yeah if you have a GREAT network
[02:20:04] <GetShwifty> *distribution network
[02:20:04] <JakeSays> Nasp: solar
[02:20:07] <Nasp> Ahh
[02:20:12] <JakeSays> and windmills actually
[02:20:13] <Nasp> Yeah, but still nighttime :D
[02:20:13] <GetShwifty> but you still got 8-12 hours where you're getting next to nothing
[02:20:26] <Nasp> Windmills are just only great for supplementary
[02:20:27] <GetShwifty> and monsoons in arizona lol
[02:20:40] <GetShwifty> yeah solar can actaully be an inbetween a primary and a supplementary
[02:20:42] <JakeSays> not true. there are several solar farms that store enough energy during the day to provide continuous power over night
[02:20:44] <Nasp> I don't want my electricity prices 20 x'ing just because there isn't a hurricane outside
[02:20:50] <GetShwifty> yeah JakeSays
[02:20:51] <GetShwifty> as i said
[02:20:53] <lz_> maybe aliens are laughing at us for building gigantic particle accelerators but still being unable to efficiently store energy
[02:21:02] <GetShwifty> if you have GREAT battery storage and/or a Great distribution network
[02:21:13] <GetShwifty> but still srsly what hapens if you get 1-2 weeks of mass cloud cover
[02:21:16] <JakeSays> GetShwifty: it's not battery storage.
[02:21:18] <Nasp> lz_:  Or just laughing at us in general
[02:21:22] <lz_> Nasp: :D
[02:21:25] <Nasp> "Look at them, they will end up killing themselves"
[02:21:33] <GetShwifty> battery storage/ energy storage/ w/e
[02:21:38] <JakeSays> there's also a very large facility being planned that uses kenetic storage
[02:21:49] <JakeSays> *kinetic
[02:21:54] <GetShwifty> the point is you have to store SOMETHING so that when there is no sun and its cold . that you continue distributing energy to meet the demands
[02:22:15] <JakeSays> of course
[02:22:20] <GetShwifty> but talking about say a nationwide scale not sure that solar scales THAT well as a primary
[02:22:25] <GetShwifty> more as a hybrid in between
[02:22:42] <GetShwifty> and to date has anybody done it on a scale of 300 million?
[02:22:50] <JakeSays> i would love to build my own power tower
[02:22:56] <GetShwifty> even chinas solar farms from waht i understand despite being the best/biggest only probvide a single digit % of power?
[02:23:03] <JakeSays> GetShwifty: 300 million what?
[02:23:06] <GetShwifty> people
[02:23:20] <JakeSays> no clue
[02:23:25] <GetShwifty> the answer is no
[02:23:34] <GetShwifty> europe hasnt done it , china hasn't done it, usa hasn't done it , south america hasn't done it
[02:23:41] <lz_> maybe we could use people as energy batteries. store them in cocoons while feeding their brain a virtual reality
[02:23:54] <JakeSays> lz_: LOL
[02:24:03] <Nasp> GetShwifty:  How about storing mechanol?
[02:24:13] <JakeSays> what is mechanol
[02:24:18] <Nasp>  Would that work for peaker plants as well
[02:24:20] <Nasp> Methanol
[02:24:35] <JakeSays> Nasp: ah. that's bad for the climate
[02:24:41] <GetShwifty> i'm honeslty not that well versed in all of the tried and proven / upcoming 'energy' storage mechanisms
[02:24:42] <lz_> Nasp: we could store hydrogen already but it's very inefficient afaik
[02:24:54] <GetShwifty> i just know there are a bunch of different stuff
[02:25:09] <Nasp> JakeSays:  It's not as bad as fuel
[02:25:14] <JakeSays> lz_: hydrogen is efficient to store, there's just no infrastructure for it
[02:25:22] <JakeSays> Nasp: it is fuel :p
[02:25:22] <GetShwifty> from my understanding it still very much a big part of the problem
[02:25:23] <Nasp> We are planning to going to burn methanol
[02:25:41] <GetShwifty> as is efficiently distributing stuff
[02:25:47] <lz_> doesn't hydrogen just produce water when used
[02:25:58] <JakeSays> Nasp: wait.. i was confusing methanol with methane
[02:26:09] <JakeSays> lz_: yup
[02:26:27] <JakeSays> but one issue with hydrogen is low energy density
[02:26:34] <Nasp> JakeSays:  It's still not a 100% burn
[02:26:47] <Nasp> Clean burn or whatever its called when it doesnt produce co2
[02:27:07] <lz_> I'm reading "a round trip efficiency of 18%-46%" for hydrogen. It's not that bad, just build 5x times more solar panels/wind turbines
[02:27:24] <Nasp> Anyways it's expensive as hell and wastes like 70% of the energy when converting it
[02:27:29] <Nasp> lz_:  YEah exactly
[02:27:44] <Nasp> lz_:  15 times more windmils
[02:28:49] <JakeSays> lz_: i think hydrogen fuel cells have a lot of potential
[02:28:59] *** Quits: jinsun (~quassel@user/jinsun) ()
[02:29:10] <lz_> Nasp: I'm thinking, maybe if we could adjust our power usage to what renewable energy we're capable of producing/storing instead of the other way around
[02:29:16] <Nasp> Don't we just still need to get them to work JakeSays ?
[02:29:19] *** Joins: jinsun (~jinsun@user/jinsun)
[02:29:26] <Nasp> Like many ideas have great potential, but we need something that works now
[02:29:49] <Nasp> lz_: That would halt everything
[02:29:58] <Nasp> Why not just unplug the powerplants completely then
[02:30:03] <lz_> Nasp: yeah it would be rough for some decades :D
[02:30:30] <lz_> Nasp: but if that's the price to pay for not heating the earth like an oven I'm down for it
[02:30:31] <irwiss> lz_: the problem isn't really adjusting tbh, more the fact that the dudes selling oil and coal want to sell it, and willing to spend tons of money to lobby against renewables
[02:30:35] <Nasp> Else let's start that WW3 that seems to be brewing
[02:30:42] <JakeSays> Nasp: fuel cells?
[02:30:46] <Nasp> Getting rid of like 80% of earths population should help a bit
[02:30:54] <lz_> that's another way of looking at it
[02:31:08] <Nasp> JakeSays:  Yeah
[02:31:34] <Nasp> Coal really shouldn't be a thing anybody uses
[02:31:44] <Nasp> And next up lets get independant of oil
[02:31:59] <Nasp> In general independant of other countries for energy
[02:32:05] <Nasp> France seems to know whats up
[02:32:12] <JakeSays> Nasp: fuel cells have been in use for many decades
[02:32:24] <lz_> Nasp: we're doing pretty good with the CO2 emissions thanks to nuclear plants
[02:32:32] <Nasp> They are building 14 new reactors
[02:32:47] <Nasp> lz_: Are you from france?
[02:32:48] <lz_> Nasp: it's a bit too late for the world to follow though, it takes time to build plants
[02:32:52] <lz_> yes
[02:32:55] <Nasp> Nice
[02:33:03] <JakeSays> lets hope none of those 14 are near an underwater fault line
[02:33:06] <Nasp> Still can't you build a plant in 10 years
[02:33:23] <lz_> Nasp: I agree with you it's still the best option for now
[02:33:24] <JakeSays> you can build a plant in a fraction of that
[02:33:26] <Nasp> Anyways 8 years left until that Paris agreement which nobody can fulfill
[02:33:34] <Nasp> Unless everybody cheats with the numbers
[02:33:56] <Nasp> JakeSays:  Seems like they take longer and longer
[02:34:00] <Nasp> But yeah would be great
[02:34:21] <JakeSays> Nasp: building the plant can be done in 2-3 years. the red tape can take decades
[02:34:24] <JakeSays> at least here
[02:34:32] <Nasp> Approval can takes just 10 years alone
[02:34:40] <Nasp> It's gotta be forced through from highest level of government
[02:34:41] <JakeSays> thats what i mean by red tape
[02:34:45] <Nasp> ahh
[02:34:51] <Nasp> I was thinking shovel
[02:35:06] <Nasp> Isn't that always what they do first, go take pictures and take the first gravel out
[02:35:53] <JakeSays> yeah - ground breaking
[02:36:47] <Nasp> We just need to make a vote
[02:36:54] <Nasp> Should we do something against climate change or not
[02:36:55] <JakeSays> fucking amazon
[02:36:58] <Nasp> And none of those inbetween stuff
[02:37:26] <lz_> https://i.redd.it/nanrqgwqonh81.jpg
[02:37:44] <Nasp> Smart
[02:38:09] <lz_> any programmer wants to code for me? I only charge 100
[02:41:24] <Nasp> Anyone actually know how fast you can dial up and down the output of a nuclear power plant?
[02:41:29] <Nasp> I have a feeling it takes a loooong time
[02:41:50] <lz_> Nasp: I think it's pretty fast
[02:42:02] <lz_> Nasp: it's just lowering/elevating some rod in stuff
[02:42:07] <Nasp> Just look at Chernobyl, Toptunov turn it up to 11!
[02:42:40] <Suchiman> Nasp: pretty fast, the control rods are just being slided next to the fuel rods to absorb the neutrons which slows down the reaction immediately and cools down (TM)
[02:43:45] <Suchiman> the problem with chernobyl was that chernobyl had a positive void coefficient
[02:44:23] <Nasp> "Modern nuclear power plants are planned for construction in five years or less (42 months for CANDU ACR-1000, 60 months from order to operation for an AP1000, 48 months from first concrete to operation"
[02:44:45] <Nasp> I wonder what your country will do for power Suchiman
[02:45:15] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Then explain to me how an RBMK reactor explodes?
[02:45:17] <Nasp> Are you stupid
[02:46:40] <Suchiman> Nasp: meaning, the water that flows around the fuel rods serve both to moderate the neutrons (same as the control rods) and to cool the rods, but when it gets to hot and the water starts to boil and steam forms, then that steam neither provides cooling anymore nor moderation of neutrons, causing the power output to rapidly spiral out of control and building up so much pressure in the reactor that it blows the cover off

[02:48:03] <Nasp> "It's exploded, nonsense RBMK reactors don't explode, are you stupid?"
[02:48:21] <Nasp> Something like that
[02:48:34] <Nasp> Also for some reason people think nuclear reactors explode in a nuclear way
[02:49:27] <Suchiman> yeah no that uranium is not enriched enough to reach critical mass :P
[02:49:28] <Suchiman> unfortunately xD
[02:49:37] <lz_> someone should find a way to create a "black hole reactor", that generates electricity out of throwing things into a tiny controlled black hole
[02:50:00] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Unfortunately?
[02:50:11] <Nasp> Blackholes is another misconception
[02:50:11] * Suchiman puts on sunglasses
[02:50:13] <lz_> if only small black holes were stable :( would make much better stories than tchernobyl
[02:50:47] <Suchiman> lz_: well that's the neat thing about black holes, the smaller they are, the faster they evaporate, meaning the more energy they radiate away
[02:50:55] <lz_> Suchiman: i know, let me dream thanks
[02:50:56] <Nasp> Like what would happen if we replaced the sun with an equal mass black hole
[02:51:44] <lz_> imagine a part of the earth inhabitable because of some black hole that went out of control and with a giant dome around it to contain it
[02:51:47] <lz_> how cool would that be
[02:53:07] <lz_> people would go and visit its neighborhood and when they come back they'd be 2000 years older
[02:53:21] <lz_> "mom! dad went to the black hole again :((("
[02:53:50] <Nasp> Suchiman:  "Modern nuclear plants with light water reactors are designed to have maneuvering capabilities in the 30-100% range with 5%/minute slope, up to 140 MW/minute."
[02:54:20] <lz_> wait it's the other way around
[02:54:21] <Nasp> So yeah fast enough
[02:54:41] <Nasp> lz_:  Yes it's opposite
[02:55:11] <lz_> you're downloading sth and it takes too much time so you go visit the blackhole and come back
[02:55:21] <lz_> but when you come back your house was sold and all your friends are dead
[02:55:56] <lz_> people look at you funny because you have "hair" and still walk on legs
[02:56:08] <DoofusCanadensis> the house is gone and so have people as you knew them
[02:58:08] <lz_> you're captured by the neopolice and put into a human zoo, along with all the other old humans that went to the black hole

[04:20:38] <BtbN> FirstOrDefault will only call the literal cirst Func
[04:21:13] <Lukky> It won't allow me to capture the reutnr value, right?
[04:21:34] <BtbN> list.Select(f -> f()).Where(r => r is not null).FirstOrDefault()?
[04:22:29] <Lukky> I'm thinking along those lines...
[04:22:47] <Lukky> I'll try again...
[04:27:19] <Lukky> I thought there was a way to not use Where...
[04:31:56] <BtbN> How else do you plan to find the first one that returned something non-null?
[04:32:19] <BtbN> If you leave out the Where, the first element can happily be null and will be returned by First()/FirstOrDefault()
[04:32:37] <Lukky> Well, there is an overload of FDirstOrDefault that takes a predicate
[04:33:58] <Lukky> var val = findFunctions.Select(f => f(originalPartNr)).FirstOrDefault(v => !string.IsNullOrEmpty(v));
[04:34:43] <Lukky> But I'm not 100% sure, and also there might be some other operator to do this
[04:35:35] <BtbN> ah, it has a built-in Where(). That of course also works.

[10:13:37] <merced> MatthiasVance: iunno
[10:14:04] <MatthiasVance> merced: In my opinion making stuff observable is the easiest way to deal with events
[10:14:14] <MatthiasVance> merced: Every .NET event is by default observable in F#
[10:14:54] <MatthiasVance> Why would you need handlers when you can just keep on building a pipeline
[10:15:09] <MatthiasVance> Pipelines are so much more composable and reusable
[10:18:25] <irwiss> jfc teams is such trash it's insane
[10:18:59] <irwiss> to mute it, you need to mute it via OS mixer because making a separate volume knob is too much... and obviously if you're using the web app you can only mute the entire browser
[10:25:37] <MatthiasVance> irwiss: There is a mute button in Teams
[10:25:53] <MatthiasVance> irwiss: Do you want to mute others or yourself btw?
[10:25:55] <irwiss> where?
[10:26:03] <irwiss> others
[10:26:49] <MatthiasVance> I believe *in a call* you can open up your device settings (which looks different when not in a call) and mute speakers there
[10:27:27] <irwiss> don't think i got anything on the web app
[10:27:36] <irwiss> google search tells me to mute the entire browser
[10:28:09] <MatthiasVance> ah browser, hm idk
[10:28:17] <MatthiasVance> You can click the tab in most browsers to mute it
[10:28:38] <MatthiasVance> irwiss: Any reason you want to use the browser app?

[14:29:56] <Nasp> 20%
[14:30:08] <Nasp> We did 10% first week
[14:30:14] <MatthiasVance> Does the CTO understand now why it's taking "so long:"?

[14:30:39] <Nasp> I'm just continuing the high risk style
[14:30:46] <MatthiasVance> Good!
[14:30:52] <Nasp> And trusts the tests
[14:30:59] <Nasp> Test  passes you say? Lets merge
[14:31:11] <Nasp> If it wasn't tested it must not be important
[14:31:33] <Nasp> I made a migration tool that rewrites the controllers :D
[14:31:44] <Nasp> Works like 80-90%
[14:32:00] <MatthiasVance> Finding the patterns, nice
[14:32:17] <Nasp> But  the largest issue is routing
[14:32:25] <Nasp> someone decided we wants specific routing for each actions
[14:32:28] <MatthiasVance> That's what "we" meant the other day, there will only be a few patterns used most likely, find those and move everything according to one pattern then test that
[14:32:29] <Nasp> Route tables like 3000 lines
[14:32:33] <MatthiasVance> wow
[14:32:47] <Nasp> Instead of just routing to the controller
[14:33:02] <Nasp> Kinda why i wanted to mix and match attribute routing with MapControllerRoute
[14:33:10] <MatthiasVance> Also, you talked the other day about what routing you would prefer, what if you can finish the migration very fast by using your style and then improve upon that as next step?
[14:33:16] <Nasp> But last week we sitched MapControllerRoute and moving it to attribute routing at the same time
[14:35:47] <Nasp> MatthiasVance: But yeah one thing i what we want for the migration and another is afterwards

[15:07:56] <MatthiasVance> To US companies, works the same for EU
[15:07:57] <interop_madness> MatthiasVance, my escalation steps would be: write company that they are in violation of GDPR --> write them again after a few weeks, telling them you will report this as a GDPR violation --> escalate further (should not be necessary)

[20:11:21] <brianonymous> net 7 preview 1 this week? i cant keep up. the day i released a net5 update is the day net6 came out
[20:16:19] <lz_> that movie would have been 100 times better https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/ss6psr/thats_one_hell_of_an_edit_lol_source_owlkitty/
[20:18:39] <jonp> irwiss: is that "ask a manager" vid real or fake?
[20:19:08] <jonp> probably fake
[20:19:26] <irwiss> your guess is as good as mine, but i saw people acting similar to that... people who worked in services industry probably seen worse
[20:19:42] <jonp> i think it's fake, *and* reality can be far worse
[20:20:08] <lz_> i'd say it's 55% real based on the fact she acknowledges the camera
[20:20:27] <Suchiman> jonp: what makes you think it's fake? xD
[20:20:45] <jonp> felt off
[20:20:58] <jonp> then there's the comments, e.g. "We don't have any yachts. / Why don't you have any yachts at this RESTAURANT!?"
[20:21:35] <Suchiman> mhm yeah that part was kinda weird xD
[20:22:30] <Suchiman> fun fact though: in germany you cannot just record someone like that :P violation of personal rights, but in the US apparently it's fine xD
[20:22:51] <jonp> in the US "it depends"
[20:23:11] <jonp> if it's in a public place, it's usually fine
[20:23:42] <jonp> if it's a phone call, depends on the state you're in; some states are only "single party needs to know" states, so you can record your own call w/o notifying the other party
[20:23:48] <jonp> other states require all parties be notified
[20:24:07] <Nasp> Suchiman:  German seem to have stricter rules in that regards
[20:24:45] <Suchiman> Nasp: yeah, the only exception is basically panorama freedom, where you're not the main subject of the picture but just happen to be in frame
[20:25:18] <Nasp> HEre it's the same you can record conversation you are part of
[20:25:21] <Nasp> Else it's wiretapping
[20:25:33] <Nasp> So all survailance cams with microphones are illegal
[20:25:56] <Suchiman> ^ only if everyone knows here, recording a conversation you are part of in secret is illegal, even for evidence reasons

[20:26:37] <Nasp> And police needs a court order i take it?
[20:26:53] <jonp> journalists *may* be able to; depends on the state
[20:27:21] <brianonymous> i live in a 'two party consent' state.. 1 of 11
[20:27:54] <Suchiman> Nasp: journalists can to some degree, as part of press freedom, police needs a court order to tap you yes
[20:29:22] <Nasp> There was a murder recently where some civilians wiretapped another civilian and the police knew
[20:29:27] <Nasp> Court dismissed the charges
[20:29:47] <Nasp> Also you can always get a court order 14 days after
[20:29:56] <Suchiman> yeah illegally acquired evidence must be discarded
[20:30:42] <Nasp> Ohh no the case gainst the wiretappers
[20:30:55] <Nasp> Illegal evidence may be used

[21:29:36] <brianonymous> thats def yolo
[21:31:26] <brianonymous> you doing any type of transcode on the ffmpeg pipeline? that alone could murder your face off
[21:32:24] <brianonymous> you can tell ffmpeg to do a raw copy/recontainerize
[21:32:38] <Suchiman> brianonymous: well youtubeDl pulls of the m4a track and streams those bytes out of StandardOutput, ffmpeg decodes those into 2 channel 44kHz PCM and the discord lib transcodes it into opus
[21:33:13] <brianonymous> discord wont take the m4a raw?
[21:33:24] <Suchiman> nope, it uses opus as codec internally
[21:33:26] <brianonymous> likely just aac-lc up in em
[21:34:02] <brianonymous> you buffering the m4a download at all?
[21:34:43] <brianonymous> since you essentially have a transcode pipeline, im betting youll get a 200-400 stream cap
[21:37:02] <Suchiman> literally just using CopyToAsync, so no explicit buffering outside of the 81kb buffer used by CopyToAsync and whatever internal buffering happens on the process boundaries (and the downside of CopyToAsync is that it will read 81kb and then write 81kb but it will not read and write at the same time)
[21:37:21] <Suchiman> 200-400 stream cap?
[21:38:09] <brianonymous> max concurrent transcodes
[21:38:46] <Suchiman> hehehe my current goal for the foreseeable future is just being able to do one concurrent stream lag free :P

[21:59:30] <Guest89> Suchiman?
[21:59:48] <Suchiman> that doesn't ring a bell for me, figure out what framework that is, but normally i'd say not directly, EF for example performs a topological sort as to insert principal entities before dependent entities
[22:00:23] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: hmm. doesnt sound familiar
[22:00:27] <Guest89> Suchiman, i think it's just linq
[22:01:47] <Suchiman> Guest89: LINQ is only System.Linq.Enumerable and System.Linq.Queryable, they do not provide db access, in the olden days there was Linq2Db which was a builtin ORM for DB access via LINQ but there are also others like NHibernate or EntityFramework (successor to Linq2Db) that support using LINQ as a query language

[23:53:45] <brianonymous> i think we can safely establish that Suchi's pet will be a cat
[23:53:57] <brianonymous> congrats, suchi
[23:54:22] <brianonymous> our floofy cats stink like hamster cages sometimes
[23:54:33] <Suchiman> brianonymous: absolutely not xD
[23:55:20] <ki9a> I'm trying to convince my inlaws to get a dog
[23:55:41] <ki9a> that's just enough dog for my daughter
[23:55:47] <brianonymous> lol
[23:55:51] <brianonymous> good tactic
[23:55:57] <ki9a> keyword is try
[23:56:20] <Suchiman> ugh, my aunt has a bunch of cats in her apartment, stinks like hell, especially since she's unable to properly care for them but does not want to see that
[23:56:20] <lz_> catch
[23:56:42] <lz_> (couldn't let that try without a catch sorry)
[23:56:45] <brianonymous> Suchiman: i have 4 here, and our place smells just great! tho, they do have their own dedicated bathroom
[23:57:46] <lz_> I miss the smell so much I kept a brush I was using to brush them
[23:57:57] <lz_> not sure if the smell is still here though
