[01:59:24] <_genuser_> jonp sup man!
[01:59:28] <_genuser_> I'm so bored at work right now.
[01:59:43] <jonp> that's why work from home is awesome. :-)
[01:59:52] <_genuser_> I'm working from home.
[02:00:03] <jonp> then how can you be *that* bored?  there's always laundry!
[02:00:05] <_genuser_> but the work is boring. unit-tests and unit tests
[02:00:09] <lz_> https://www.reddit.com/r/CrappyDesign/comments/tai7qp/what_could_go_wrong/
[02:00:20] <_genuser_> hehe, I just did laundry like monday, I think.
[02:00:29] <jonp> lz_: if the safe is fireproof…
[02:00:36] <jonp> it'll just become a *less* secret safe
[02:01:32] <jonp> lz_: found from ^^, wtf? https://www.reddit.com/r/CrappyDesign/comments/t6o3ft/the_gaelic_athletic_association_in_ireland_show/
[02:01:43] <jonp> *impressively* bad
[02:02:05] <lz_> i've seen this one. actually i think i've seen all reddit posts so far
[02:02:36] <jonp> that sounds sus
[02:02:45] <jonp> unless you mean for that subreddit
[02:02:51] <lz_> nah nvm I wasn't talking about the nsfw ones
[02:03:10] <fejj> anyone on Linux?
[02:03:11] <jonp> there are sfw subreddits?!
[02:04:13] <fejj> jonp /r/bowyer
[02:05:37] <BSaboia> Where do you guys search for remote roles? I want a new gig. I am tired of TypeScript stuff
[02:06:28] <fejj> do you not get recruiter spam?
[02:07:03] <_genuser_> BSaboia dude, go to linkedin, change your status to open for new jobs.
[02:07:10] <_genuser_> sit back and wait for all teh recruiter spam to roll in.
[02:07:21] <fejj> mine is set to not interested and I *still* get recruiter spam :)
[02:07:49] <_genuser_> make sure to have a good profile with lots of info on what you're working with currently so at least 60% of the spam will be actually about jobs you would consider.
[02:07:54] <_genuser_> otherwise, they'll just spam you about everything.
[02:07:57] <lz_> fejj: from where? linkedin?
[02:09:08] <fejj> yea, linkedin, to my @microsoft.com address, to personal address - a lot of it refers to my github
[02:09:55] <_genuser_> fejj maybe you picture looks like you enjoy spam.
[02:09:58] <fejj> "You would be great for this team I'm hiring for! It's all Java and Python and your profile suggests you'd be PERFECT for this role!"
[02:10:29] <lz_> maybe i should create a linkedin one day. but then i would have 0 contact and that would be sus
[02:10:34] <fejj> I swear most of my recruiter spam is trying to hire me for either python dev opr java dev
[02:10:34] <_genuser_> fejj lol, I see those a lot. All my jobs are microsoft tech stack c#/.net and someone will try to tell me about a java job.
[02:10:36] <BSaboia> _genuser_, recruiter spam is tiresome
[02:11:03] <lz_> one day I had a linkedin invite but I refused it, it wasn't even someone from work lol
[02:11:13] <_genuser_> BSaboia read throught the roles, the ones you like send them a response. My last job offers were from linkedin.
[02:11:18] <BSaboia> A friend of mine put a rocket as his first name, he receives a lot of "Hello {rocket}! Your profile is amazing! ..."
[02:11:35] <fejj> haha
[02:12:14] <BSaboia> LinkedIn anti-phishing at its finest
[02:12:31] <_genuser_> lz_ the goal is to sign up, send a few invites out. Maybe co-workers, maybe other people in the same industry. Then it will start suggesting people, send invites to all of them that look like they're int eh same field of possibly higher up who could hire you.
[02:12:54] <BSaboia> I have a lot of LinkedIn invites already. Let's see how this rolls out
[02:13:06] <_genuser_> lz_ overtime, recruiters will start sending you invites, conenct with them. When they search for a candidate for a job, you'll pop up over others who aren't connected to them.
[02:13:09] <lz_> _genuser_: I guess I should have done that when I was still working in companies :D
[02:13:21] <_genuser_> lz_ contracting now?
[02:13:30] <lz_> yes
[02:13:37] <_genuser_> lz_ once you put your last few companies, it will sugest people from there anyway.
[02:13:52] <fejj> anyone on Linux who'd be interested in running a benchmark of some c code for me?
[02:14:35] <lz_> _genuser_: that'd be really weird, I'm not in contact with any of them anymore
[02:14:59] <lz_> and it's been years
[02:15:25] <lz_> anyway when I'm searching for a full time gig I guess I want to choose where I'm applying to anyway
[02:15:29] <_genuser_> lz_ imo, they still are your professional network. Your professional network isn't just people you work with now. But people you have worked with past or present. In other words, they have some experience with working with you.

[02:38:55] <_genuser_> I dislike that part too.
[02:39:10] <_genuser_> the only thing that linkedin has is my picture (because those profiles are generally more serious), job info.
[02:39:16] <_genuser_> no address, no phone number.

[05:40:22] <smallville7123> how do i fix this?
[05:40:39] <smallville7123> 'View.mAttachInfo()' must declare a body because it is not marked abstract, extern, or partial
[05:40:48] <smallville7123> internal ref AttachInfo mAttachInfo;
[05:41:19] <smallville7123> if i remove `ref` i do not get the error
[05:41:23] <jonp> i don't think you can have `ref T` members in a class or struct.
[05:41:37] <jonp> you can have a `ref T` *return type*, so the compiler is *assuming* you're trying to declare a method
[05:41:48] <jonp> but the method decl is missing...parameters, and a method body, and…
[05:42:14] <jonp> or you need to be declaring a ref struct?
[05:43:03] <jonp> smallville7123: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/ref
[05:43:15] <jonp> "`ref` members" is *not* something mentioned there.
[05:43:34] <jonp> you can use `ref` on parameters, method return types, and method local variables.
[05:43:37] <jonp> class members are not mentioned
[05:44:10] <smallville7123> i need to copy and store AttributeInfo by reference, not by value
[05:44:39] <jonp> is AttributeInfo a reference type, i.e. a class, not a struct?
[05:44:55] <jonp> if it is a reference type, why do you need to store by ref?
[05:47:59] <smallville7123> https://gist.github.com/mgood7123/de842cc933371ab4bab707c4cabade4d
[05:48:18] <smallville7123> this is my AttributeInfo and where it gets assigned and why it must be a ref
[05:49:13] <jonp> AttachInfo is a class, so that doesn't really explain why it must be a ref
[05:49:26] <jonp> given `internal AttachInfo mAttachInfo;`
[05:49:45] <smallville7123> see below
[05:50:14] <jonp> i don't even know what i'm reading "below"
[05:50:58] <smallville7123> scroll down lol
[05:51:17] <jonp> right; lines 56-66
[05:51:23] <jonp> is that a stack trace? JSON?  garbage?  other?
[05:51:26] <jonp> what IS it?
[05:51:31] <jonp> i don't know how to interpret it
[05:51:49] <jonp> a debugger expansion?
[05:52:00] <jonp> it's certainly not a clarification or an answer
[05:52:53] <smallville7123> debugger expansion
[05:53:06] <jonp> okay
[05:53:11] <jonp> so what do you need to avoid?
[05:53:22] <jonp> "in order to avoid the following"; what's wrong with "the following"?
[05:53:28] <smallville7123> equivilant to lldb's `p` command to print a variable
[05:55:01] <smallville7123> well the way it is supposed to work, is ViewRootImpl calls `mContentParent.dispatchAttachedToWindow(mAttachInfo, 0);` which attaches its mAttachInfo to the View.cs instance, in which any changes made to ViewRootImpl's mAttachInfo should be reflected in View.cs's mAttachInfo
[05:55:38] <jonp> and since AttachInfo is a class, that should Just Work w/o `internal ref AttachInfo mAttachInfo`
[05:55:46] <jonp> as they'll be the same runtime instance
[05:55:49] <smallville7123> except it doesnt
[05:56:16] <smallville7123> imma try to maake a testcase
[06:06:16] <smallville7123> tf ;-;      https://onecompiler.com/csharp/3xvnk94bg
[06:08:55] <jonp> that's a new website
[06:09:09] <smallville7123> ohhhh nvm i think i know why
[06:09:30] <smallville7123> it is because i am not replacing mAttachInfo.mViewRootImpl with this mViewRootImpl instance

[10:47:50] <MatthiasVance> :D
[10:48:03] <MatthiasVance> Thursday is kind of like friday for me
[10:48:08] <MatthiasVance> Because my friday is my 20% day
[10:48:20] <jmer> your 20% day?
[10:48:24] <jmer> 20% what?
[10:48:32] <MatthiasVance> Yes I can spend 20% on doing whatever technical stuff I want
[10:48:37] <jmer> Oh
[10:48:47] <jmer> here I thought it was a day where you only have to work 20% of the normal workday time :D
[10:48:58] <MatthiasVance> Well that doesn't feel like work
[10:49:26] <jmer> so is it 20% of Friday time or the week time?
[10:50:27] <MatthiasVance> The week
[10:50:33] <jmer> So entire friday?
[10:50:40] <MatthiasVance> Yes
[10:50:42] <jmer> That's pretty sweet actually
[10:50:45] <MatthiasVance> Well no, it's 20% of your time
[10:50:51] <MatthiasVance> You can plan your time however fits you best
[10:50:54] <MatthiasVance> Not necessarily friday
[10:51:00] <MatthiasVance> That goes for all the work you do really
[10:51:06] <MatthiasVance> Everyone will first ask what fits *you*
[10:51:11] <MatthiasVance> Before planning a meeting
[10:51:50] <MatthiasVance> And sometimes (pretty often actually) when someone sees it's going to be real nice weather they choose to go out instead the next day and start working 14:00/15:00

[11:12:26] <jmer> I think I am around 100k$ pr. year (before taxes)
[11:12:32] <JakeSays> because i seriously doubt it's going to be a long term thing
[11:14:31] <JakeSays> so a couple of weeks ago i paid off my truck and thought "hmm.. what am i going to do with the extra $370/mo?" the VERY next day i get an email from my landlord saying they're raising my rent $500/mo.
[11:18:49] <jmer> JakeSays: wth... that's a lot?

[12:46:07] <MatthiasVance> Is it just "everything is different" or something more substantial?
[12:46:28] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, it feels heavier to debugg stuff with it
[12:46:33] <MatthiasVance> How come?
[12:46:55] <MaNa2k> when debugging, then stepping back and fort and stuff like that is just too unstable

[12:48:40] <MatthiasVance> Hm I would dive into that if I were you
[12:48:43] <MaNa2k> in core\.net6 you are more dependent on external azure services, thus making the code run slower due to auths and related stuff

[12:51:08] <MaNa2k> so are you telling me, if we created a simple console app in framwork and in .net6, the .net6 would build and run faster ?
[12:51:09] <MatthiasVance> And that's just ONE version

[12:52:07] <Babbage> if .net 6 framework has been loaded by system (as its not used as much yet) when you start app vs say your running a version 5 where it has been already by something else

[15:49:58] <MatthiasVance> So now they want all background info and I think they might want to assess the "risk" of me going fully into my business as opposed to have a steady day job :p

[18:06:46] <jmer> and you shouldn't be using it for IDs
[18:07:04] <interop_madness> if the id is a number, then no
[18:07:15] <jmer> there's also a status column... when I do a distinct select there's: unapproved, approved, 1,2,3,4 and NULL >.<

[18:09:59] <Suchiman> jmer: no, char(32) will always take up 32 bytes, nchar(32) will always take up 64 bytes, varchar(32) will take up sizeof(int length) + length number of bytes while nvarchar(32) takes up sizeof(int length) + (length * 2) bytes
[18:11:39] <Suchiman> (var)char only stores 8 bit encoded data (although with SQL Server 2019 you can actually have UTF 8 as a "codepage" in there) while n(var)char stores 2 byte UTF16 codepoints

[18:29:06] <lz_> irwiss: I expect there's multiple ways to write some expressions, so no
[18:29:21] <lz_> unless you're willing to have the ide change your code to sth else
[18:29:27] <irwiss> asts don't change expressions so they'd remain how you written them
[18:29:47] <lz_> irwiss: there could be different syntaxes for the same ast, no?
[18:32:05] <irwiss> whitespace changes, newlines, parentheses which are "for clarity" and such yes, but if ast changes order of expressions it'd be super weird ast
[18:32:26] <jonp> irwiss: sounds like Intentional Programming: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_programming
[18:33:09] <irwiss> ah, didn't know someone already explored that, cool
[18:33:11] <lz_> irwiss: a+(b+c), a+b+c, etc? it's not juste whitespaces
[18:33:58] <lz_> sorry you mentioned parenthesis
[18:34:07] <lz_> but I'm sure there are tons of other ways to write the same stuff
[18:36:59] <irwiss> yeah that's sort of my point - there's too many ways and they're reflected in text files and in git diffs, instead you could configure your IDE how you want it to display stuff or let you edit it, but you don't decide on tabs/spaces, whitespace, newlines, order of props/fields/methods, order of methods in class and tons of other stuff that's a
[18:36:59] <irwiss> matter of personal taste for other devs, your ide will format your code according to your config
[18:37:35] <lz_> fair point

[19:42:13] <MatthiasVance> I thought I had covid because throat felt different from normal
[19:42:17] <MatthiasVance> But tested negative 2 times so ..
[19:42:20] <MatthiasVance> (self test)
[19:42:35] <irwiss> i mean, normal colds are still out there
[19:42:41] <MatthiasVance> jmer: 2,26 EUR / L gasoline is expensive yes.. I was already paying a premium for Euro 98 / Super xD
[19:42:59] <MatthiasVance> irwiss: Yeah true but was expecting with everything opening again and no distancing etc. that I would get it soon :D
[19:43:19] <blezz> lz_
[19:43:33] <blezz> it was mild for me for the first day, but the second it was quite bad
[19:46:51] <lz_> MatthiasVance: yeah i should probably buy a self test :(
[19:47:00] <MatthiasVance> Buy several?
[19:48:08] <lz_> I self isolated for like a month and a half in january, but i fully expected I would get it as soon as I went back to sports
[19:48:23] <lz_> in retrospect I probably shouldn't have self isolated at all since I was going to get it anyway
[19:48:43] <irwiss> imo self tests are so unreliable they're borderline useless
[19:48:55] <blezz> btw how much is the period of green certificate in EU? I checked mine with a german app and it said 12 months

[22:32:06] <Suchiman> Crysis? xD
[22:32:55] <jmer> MatthiasVance: What category?
[22:33:04] <MatthiasVance> jmer: I am .. not sure.
[22:33:10] <MatthiasVance> Suchiman: You can play those on Switch? :D
[22:33:17] <MatthiasVance> Also they are terribly expensive :(
[22:33:26] <Suchiman> MatthiasVance: yep! xD
[22:33:36] <Suchiman> MatthiasVance: can it run crysis? yes, yes it can
[22:33:44] <jmer> MatthiasVance: you can play The Witcher 3 on switch but it's only really attractive if you want to play the witchero n the go (it can sync with your steam save games)
[22:33:49] <MatthiasVance> I have been doing some Hades, which is nice. I have the 3D mario which I don't like because I don't like playing in 3D worlds, would have preferred a 2D one
[22:33:53] <Suchiman> MatthiasVance: they did port the remaster onto the switch
[22:34:25] <redoc> Anyone want to buy my switch? lol, it just sits and does nothing
[22:34:44] <jmer> MatthiasVance: if you want 2D mario you need the New Super Mario Bros U. Deluxe
[22:34:57] <MatthiasVance> redoc: Yeah that's the default here as well
[22:35:19] <MatthiasVance> I really enjoyed the Zelda one until I left the game for too long and now don't know the commands and strong enemies respawn all the time lol

[22:35:47] <MatthiasVance> jmer: Was about to ask, thanks!

[22:36:10] <MatthiasVance> But am not a "fan" or anything
[22:36:16] <MatthiasVance> And didn't complete them I think

[22:37:25] <Suchiman> unacceptable
[22:37:29] <jmer> Crysis is shit
[22:37:44] <jmer> The Witcher 3 is awesome

[22:38:37] <MatthiasVance> I have no idea what to make of that haha
[22:38:40] <MatthiasVance> Also every game is EUR 60
[22:38:51] <jmer> MatthiasVance: yeah Switch is the most expensive platform of them all xD
[22:39:02] <MatthiasVance> I could buy one game a month and have some budget left perhaps lol
[22:39:15] <jmer> MatthiasVance: well... Your character can get hit by pokemons battling now... And you can move around while they are battling each other...
[22:39:47] <MatthiasVance> I'll be happy once they make childcare cheaper :P

[22:42:34] <MatthiasVance> And they kept respawning whenever I went back to that area so ...
[22:42:36] <MatthiasVance> Lost the joy there
[22:43:03] <jmer> yeah it can be a bit tough at times... It's an impressively good game and I'm amazed at what they can get out of the Switch's hardware

[22:44:07] <MatthiasVance> You know what I really want, not necessarily Switch related .. a good dancing game

[22:44:18] <jmer> dancing games?
[22:44:20] <MatthiasVance> I had one on Xbox 360 with the first Kinect
[22:44:23] <MatthiasVance> That would track your moves
[22:44:25] <MatthiasVance> Yeah!
[22:44:39] <MatthiasVance> That would make me happy but I gave up years ago
[22:44:48] <jmer> There are dancing games for the switch
[22:45:00] <jmer> but based on my reaction from my daughter, the kinect based ones are way better
[22:45:00] <MatthiasVance> Yeah but that doesn't track your full body moves probably?
[22:45:12] <jmer> I think she got disappouinted she needed to hold the controls and that it didn't register the entire body
[22:45:17] <MatthiasVance> indeed
[22:45:21] <MatthiasVance> that sucks, that's not dancing

[23:21:36] <MatthiasVance> Lots of bright colors
[23:21:54] <MatthiasVance> Alienation?
[23:22:24] <MatthiasVance> Yeah definitely that
[23:24:06] <jmer> I played a bit of the last of us on my ps4, spiderman and Ghost of Tsushima
[23:24:20] <jmer> The Last of us was really disappointing I don't see why this game is getting all that praise

[23:24:49] <jmer> I mean, it's not a bad game, but I had expected something better than a somewhat decent stealth action game with more focus on story than usual
[23:24:51] <MatthiasVance> Hm I played the last of us at too high difficulty and got stuck at a part

[23:30:30] <MatthiasVance> Wait, e-books are more expensive than printed books now??
[23:30:47] <jmer> it's been a while since I bought one
[23:31:06] <MatthiasVance> I'm thinking of buying a printed book for a change and see if that makes me pick it up quicker

[23:32:19] <jmer> MatthiasVance: I've considdered asking my manager for some education time to read a book about something useful for work.
[23:32:44] <jmer> I simply can't find the time... erh... well probably more motivation to do it in the evenings after work
[23:33:11] <MatthiasVance> jmer: Yeah and that's exactly why they offer that 20% I was talking about
[23:33:27] <MatthiasVance> So you don't have to offer up personal time
[23:33:44] <jmer> MatthiasVance: They gave everyone linkedin learning and I can apply for various courses, but I am a bit in doubt about time for reading a book
[23:34:05] <jmer> But I have a 1:1 session with him next week. so let's see

[23:35:17] <_genuser_> who needs unicode.
[23:35:21] <_genuser_> basic text is fine.
[23:35:47] <jmer> _genuser_: fine with me, I don't mind ae, oe and aa
[23:36:14] <_genuser_> and here in teh US since we don't even have those, we don't care at all.

[23:37:23] <jmer> _genuser_: but what about the emojis!!!

[23:39:01] <irwiss> MatthiasVance: sell off your switch and get steam deck :P
[23:39:22] <jmer> a steamdeck is what... 5-6 Switch games? :P
[23:39:41] <MatthiasVance> 10
[23:40:03] <MatthiasVance> irwiss: Why though?
[23:40:16] <irwiss> cause then you have a ton of games
[23:40:59] <irwiss> also put emulator on it and you can play most nintendo games too
[23:41:06] <irwiss> the good ones at least :P
[23:41:19] <MatthiasVance> Then I'd still have to buy those first
[23:41:25] <MatthiasVance> ( ;p )
[23:41:48] <MatthiasVance> The parenthesis are not part of that emoticon... =/
[23:43:49] <MatthiasVance> irwiss: I worry about ergonomics of the touchpads though

[23:45:29] <MatthiasVance> But yeah it *might* be the best of both worlds
[23:45:49] <MatthiasVance> Except the reason for Switch was also to have some retro feelings and get mario and pokemon for example
[23:46:10] <MatthiasVance> Also another very good game: Little Inferno
[23:46:15] <MatthiasVance> Did you play that jmer?
