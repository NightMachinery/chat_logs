I have a script that starts and then exits after it spawns several other processes and then another that stops those processes.

[00:50:01] <kapaun> I may choose to make it a collaborative effort in the future, I would like that option but for now I want to just keep it to myself.

[01:05:28] <MockingMoniker> kapaun, you can use a firewall to block it.

[01:10:39] <kapaun> Let me clarify, can I run the backend of wordpress through Tor?
[01:10:46] <kapaun> so that when I download a plugin, it goes through Tor
[01:10:56] <kapaun> while still having it act as a normal web server
[01:11:10] <kapaun> so I can go to it over local host or if I port forward/reverse proxy, access it over the interent
[01:11:10] <MockingMoniker> Wordpess for your content, and then you configure your environment to isolate it so WP can't do any cute stuff behind your back like contact the IRS for your money laundering scheme.

[02:40:07] <SnoopJ> IRC is a bunch of computers in an "IRC network" that talk to each other and share messages with each other. You connect to one of the computers in the network, and when you send it messages, it sends them along to all the other computers, and all the other users connected to those.
[02:40:23] <MockingMoniker> It's Kafka but for humans.
[02:40:24] <ayecee> modern chat networks are probably more similar to xmpp than irc, yeah

[03:12:54] <SnoopJ> So I guess nobody knows of a glaringly obvious reason MADV_DONTDUMP would succeed (I see the 'dd' flag set in /proc/<pid>/smaps, even, and the excluded memory isn't accessible from gdb), but wouldn't change the size of the resulting core file?
[03:13:00] <keir> Scotch is a type of whiskey though
[03:13:03] <Psi-Jack> Some will call Scotch like a Whiskey, but the brewing process is quite different.
[03:13:17] <n4dir> Psi-Jack: then, perhaps, try that movie.
[03:13:26] <keir> it's malt whiskey
[03:13:28] <Guest6835> alcohol is adictive and can be dangerous: take care, people

[03:33:36] <MockingMoniker> My theory is that IRC == Linux. People will randomly start pretending to know what Linux is, and then it becomes a thing. Everybody is too scared to admit they don't know what that thing is so they just roll with it and add to it. Then the original developers who were making this up as they go along realize they're out of the loop, and to maintain their reputations will implement the ideas and say that's how it's always been.

[03:57:04] <Psi-Jack> Man, Zorin OS kinda pisses me off. "How much does Zorin OS cost?" Core or Lite editions are free, but you can also purchase Zorin OS Pro.....
[03:57:15] <Psi-Jack> For $39
[03:57:24] <Sauvin> Why does that piss you off?
[03:57:56] <Psi-Jack> Because they're basically selling barely customized stuff that other people made.
[03:58:23] <SnoopJ> You're gonna be furious when you learn about the broader economy.
[03:58:26] <Sauvin> I seem to recall that the licenses say that's OK.
[03:58:31] <keir> Charging for Linux feels wrong though
[03:58:40] <Psi-Jack> Sauvin: Depends on the licenses, actually. 🙂
[03:58:43] <Seirdy> agreed; copies of software are not a scarce resource
[03:58:45] <Guest6835> crazygamer15[m]: run console (a black box with only letters where you run commands in :P) into the folder/directory the app is placed and type "wine application_name_here" (without quotes)
[03:58:48] <dragonmaster> The kernel's under the GPL
[03:58:48] <Seirdy> labor is the scarce resource
[03:58:49] <rascul> does it come with a dead tree book though?
[03:59:00] <SnoopJ> Seirdy++
[03:59:10] <Seirdy> it makes sense to pay for service, not files
[03:59:33] <Seirdy> service can include customization, consultation, support, SaaS, training, etc.
[03:59:34] <crazygamer15[m]> how do i display thubnails in zorin os 16
[03:59:46] <crazygamer15[m]> thumbnails
[03:59:47] <Psi-Jack> And they took KDE Connect and GSConnect and made a fork of both as "Zorin Connect", which does absolutely nothing, is more limited because it only works on Android.
[04:00:00] <Seirdy> AWS can beat you at SaaS but the can't get beat the original devs at a support+SaaS package
[04:00:05] <keir> reminds me of Brave Chat
[04:00:10] <keir> or whatever it is
[04:00:16] <keir> which is just Jitsy
[04:00:33] <SnoopJ> oops, I just noticed that madvise() sample still says "scikit-learn" in the output instead of "libfoo"
[04:00:56] <Sauvin> Then you would probably agree that, as an enterprise, Zorin has bleak projected economic outlook.
[04:01:16] <Seirdy> well if they can pivot to services then things might look okay

[04:01:57] <SnoopJ> Sauvin, it is difficult to conclude otherwise for entities of any scale, with a sufficiently long outlook :/
[04:02:19] <SnoopJ> but maybe learning to shed pessimism is part of the growing-up too

[06:07:38] <ananke> slurm is a queueing and resource management system. it will manage resources, schedule jobs, but it won't magically split code

[06:08:12] <SnoopJ> I don't think "magically split code" is necessarily what the problem *is*, I think that may just be their approach to some underlying task. I can't say either way with what we know.

[06:10:28] <mlu> eom-dev: they're just not practical to even turn on most of the time
[06:11:15] <hodapp> there are like 13,672 libraries/packages released every year that promise to automagically parallelize your shitty sequential code
[06:11:17] <ananke> and there is no magic in HPC. you _must_ have code that can be parallelized, even if it's trivial parallelization. there is nothing that will take some random bash script and make it magically parallel

[06:11:47] <eom-dev> mlu: true, perhaps a wake-on-lan solution would work, but again you would have to have a job worth the boot time (which is considerably short considering they dont have any peripherals).
[06:11:52] <ananke> hodapp: closest thing is openmp for 'magic', as all it requires is some pragma statements in your C code

[06:15:47] <mlu> in fact, HPC is only appropriate for certain types of problems
[06:15:57] <eom-dev> If we look at a bash script as a string, we could create a tree of individual commands.  From this tree we could schedule which tasks are blocked by which, send commands out, and wait for responses.

[06:17:30] <hodapp> ananke: was SSI ever used for much of anything beyond research? I dabbled a little but with Kerrighed and OpenSSI but it seemed like almost anything that parallelized easily there just already had ad-hoc solutions that did it more cleanly

[10:05:08] <p`> but if you don't give a shit it really doesn't matter at all between them, except that mpv is most maintained for linux
[10:05:58] <p`> i use loudnorm a lot, for example, which is easiest with mpv

[10:08:42] <p`> understandable.  yeah there was kind of a no-man's land for a year or two.  mpv took over after that

[10:09:15] <gadfly> but yeah ive never used it in scripting etc
[10:09:19] <p`> that's just codecs
[10:09:22] <gadfly> or to interact with ffmpeg

[11:34:27] <pnbeast> You can find z-language compilers and interpreters, nowadays.  It's really cool.

[13:55:56] <jason1234> the main difference with BSD is that the first thing BSD does it to distribute the source code. the software is compiled, crossly, and it is running on all archs. Linux is just distribution of binaries, isos, and source is not important. bit away from the Libre, Stallman tradition.

[16:10:05] <jim> nomagno, it's possible that the mime type code can somehow identify whether an object is a specific mime type... what I was saying before, is that in order for it to be a functioning thing, the mime type code would need sections of code to implement the various functions that are necessary to make mime types "work"

[16:26:05] <Blondie101010> as I said before, mime type is based on magic numbers, and those have existed for many decades
[16:26:22] <Blondie101010> it is currently the most reliable way to identify a common file type
[16:27:05] <rascul> mime types are standardized by iana, freedesktop provides shared-mime-info which has the mime type db in large use by linux desktops
[16:27:08] <nomagno> Blondie101010: Whose docs and whose code?

[16:28:08] <nomagno> rascul: does the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority define the XML format freedesktop talks about?
[16:28:18] <rascul> no
[16:28:23] <Blondie101010> that's irrelevant
[16:28:27] <rascul> are you trying to add a new type to iana or new one on the system?
[16:28:32] <Blondie101010> what they care about is the rule
[16:28:32] <nomagno> Blondie101010: I am trying to solve no problem, I just want to figure out what MIME types are and if they are useful in my case
[16:28:46] <Blondie101010> so state your case
[16:29:04] <Blondie101010> if it's to identify or validate a file type, mime *IS* the solution
[16:29:23] <nomagno> I am simply trying to figure out if I have the MIME spec leeway to define a custom mime type with no aditional context. And I do. That is all I wanted to know

[16:32:58] <Blondie101010> if it's only internal to your app, it doesn't need a mime type
[16:33:19] <Blondie101010> though you could include same integrity / validity flags
[16:33:44] <Blondie101010> those belong in your app's technical design and that's it
[16:33:50] <nomagno> I am simply defining what IANA calls a "personal/experimental" MIME type because my program is designed to be modular and interoperable, and it will be handling multiple types of potentially ambiguous data

[16:35:18] <nomagno> What point am I missing? MIME types provide a good framework to achieve the goal. A mime type is "foo/bar;par=val". That is good enough.
[16:35:23] <Blondie101010> the JSON input you feed to your app can only be validated as JSON and your app must validate the fields and business requirements
[16:36:18] <Blondie101010> I'll end with this:  you'll *very* likely end up doing something that works, but that no one wants to touch ever, and that only makes your app more complicated without ANY benefit
[16:36:50] <nomagno> What fields and business requirements? I am fooling around with a public, free spec for a very domain-specific and unremarkable task, and implementing it in a very unassuming way

[16:37:51] <Blondie101010> a mime type is meant to make a common format recognizable
[16:37:58] <Blondie101010> you're just using JSON
[16:37:59] <nomagno> MIME types are two strings separated by a forward slash. They don't do anything
[16:38:07] <Blondie101010> no

[18:56:32] <lopid> you are opening /some/file for reading and writing

[19:46:14] <Enitin> Quick question: Why can start programs via GUI (KDE) but not via terminal? It always gives me "Error: cannot open display: :0". But when I cat the environment variables from a running GUI process it says "DISPLAY=:0".

[20:02:56] <hexnewbie> keir: the error message Enitin got in 99.99% of the cases is caused by failing to open /tmp/.X11-unix/X0 or getting rejected from there due to failure to read the correct ~/.Xauthority. Membership in wheel, dbus variables should never be a factor.
[20:03:10] <Enitin> It's working now.

[21:58:14] <jcbjoe2021> oh ok kfrench didn't know it was gonna be this crazy. i will just use another temrinal and think about doing this patch thing. i know its a way to learn but not right now. Thanks kfrench and nomagno

[23:59:32] <LiaoTao> phogg, I tend to be in the same camp, but this particular exercise is out of the ordinary
[23:59:49] <nomagno> You can probably simply drag them around to folders '1' '2' '3'... 'A' 'B' ... 'Z' then use a script to rename them
