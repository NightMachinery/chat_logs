[22:10:23] <phao> Hi. I imagine you people get this question a lot... But isn't the whole slow load time of packages an issue in Julia?

[22:27:22] <mikko> yes, it is an issue but more of an inconvenience rather than a show-stopper for me personally at least
[22:28:14] <phao> mikko, Right. I was just curious, tbh.
[22:28:38] <phao> I'm thinking that (as it seems to me) most people use Julia through the notebooks, so it doesn't look like a big issue there.
[22:29:49] <mikko> yeah it just slows the start-up by a few seconds, which is admittedly annoying, but if you're working on something for a long time it really doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things
[22:32:24] <mikko> and if there's a specific package you use all the time (like OhMyREPL) pre-compiled system images can help with start-up time https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/devdocs/sysimg/
[22:33:24] <phao> Cool package.
[22:35:12] <phao> I'll check out this system image stuff. I wonder, mostly, about the possibility of using a julia program within a script (like shell script of a python program) that would run it many times. I had to do this a few times with Octave (which is what I use for my numerical stuff that I study).
[22:37:01] <mikko> for application code there are some ways to compile the whole thing, i haven't looked into that myself though so i can't say how well they work
[22:37:43] <phao> Oh... From what you're telling me, it looks like the whole thing is completely manageable. 
[22:38:01] <phao> I'll look into those things. Thank you.
