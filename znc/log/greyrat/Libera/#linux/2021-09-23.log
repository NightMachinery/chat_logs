I would suggest them KDE Neon or something Ubuntu, Debian related, at first.

[04:07:58] <n4dir> yeah that is what i meant. I lacked the right words. Just create them your own
[04:08:14] <euouae> `Documents` makes no sense, everything is a document
[04:08:19] <euouae> or nothing is; depending on your viewpoint'
[04:08:53] <n4dir> funny enough quite some audio-tools like lmms think it is a wonderful idea to put projects in Documents

[04:10:03] <euouae> Hmm?? under $HOME/
[04:10:12] <valderen> Oh woops, ~
[04:10:29] <valderen> Good idea :)
[04:10:35] <n4dir> euouae: anyway, if you got a different organisation system, you probably want to edit the mentioned file in .config
[04:10:43] <valderen> I think openSUSE sets up a ~/bin directory by default
[04:10:52] <euouae> I've actually written a program that maintains a database of my files for me so that I don't have to remember where their paths are, only a vague description of them
[04:11:08] <n4dir> it bugs me a lot if folders i never need are getting created again. So for me removing xdg-user-dirs usually is what i want.
[04:11:11] <euouae> n4dir, the problem being, I don't like it at all, not even if edited
[04:11:15] <valderen> euouae: OoOoo, what are you using for that?
[04:11:18] <pnbeast> euouae, where do you keep your musical notes?
[04:11:24] <euouae> valderen, I wrote it in python
[04:11:26] <valderen> n4dir: Good idea.
[04:11:29] <n4dir> euouae: then remove the package, if possible
[04:11:31] <valderen> Good ol' Python :)
[04:11:31] <euouae> valderen and it uses Xapian
[04:11:37] <euouae> n4dir <3  thank you
[04:11:38] <n4dir> in debian you can run in meta-package problems, i think
[04:11:57] <euouae> valderen I plan to release it to the public soon; just gotta sort out the licensing & packaging a bit better
[04:12:08] <valderen> euouae: That'd be awesome :)
[04:12:08] <euouae> and some critical features like backup
[04:12:32] <valderen> So remove xdg, create personalized directories and check permissions :)
[04:12:59] <euouae> yeah I'm not 100% sure I'll remove it... I don't want to run into problems, Fedora here, but I might just let it be there. Some programs create files there by default, like gnome-screenshot
[04:13:07] <rascul> you can set the xdg directories to wherever you want
[04:13:18] <euouae> The problem is that there's nothing appropriate for them rascal ;P
[04:13:22] <n4dir> well, if you comment everything in ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs; it won't create anything either.
[04:13:27] <valderen> user-dirs.defaults
[04:13:32] <n4dir> just saying if removing will not work.
[04:13:44] <valderen> It should work -- it's Linux :)
[04:13:53] <euouae> I think at this point it's a matter of doing a lot of configuration and so I'll stay with it
[04:13:55] <valderen> Or atleast, make it work.

[05:28:19] <mlu> mihael: could be much smaller if you compress it (i.e. with gzip or bz2)

[05:28:47] <mlu> if it's a mixture of content, I typically use 70% the uncompressed size as a rule of thumb

[05:32:41] <SineDeviance> mihael: if you have space to store AND compress on the other machine, you could rsync or rsnapshot the entire directory to the other system first and then tar it
[05:32:48] <mlu> some of theo lder systems might acutally be capped by the encryption/decryption than the network itself (esp. the case on a gigabit network)

[05:40:13] <SineDeviance> otherwise it'll assume BIOS/MBR type
[05:40:22] <SineDeviance> which will force you to reinstall
[05:40:25] <sybariten> i know thaat EFI is related to BIOS in some way, but other than that i don't know much. So i don't know if i'm using UEFI. But i do know that i have a 500 mb partition with EFI in the name
[05:40:32] *** Joins: fikran (~fikran@user/fikran)
[05:40:50] <SineDeviance> EFI is not related to BIOS. it has REPLACED BIOS

[05:41:13] <SineDeviance> the way it is installed (i.e. how it sits on the disk) is also different
[05:41:17] <sybariten> yeah, but.. thats what i meant. Its related to bios-type of issues
[05:41:25] <SineDeviance> *sigh*
[05:41:47] <SineDeviance> why do you think it _might_ have a boot problem? have you tested it?
[05:41:50] <sybariten> rather than, say, printer drivers or USB ports....

[11:38:14] <iomari891> greetings, I'm trying to configure sr-iov on my server. WHenever i try: "echo 8 > /sys/class/net/enp71s0/device/sriov_numvfs" I get the error: "-bash: echo: write error: No such file or directory". However the device is clerly present when you list the folder and the access is r/w for root whihc is the current user. Any help will be appreciated.

[11:39:51] <hexnewbie> mrtg and rrdtool are independent pieces of software, but they can be integrated (i.e. mrtg can use rrdtool databases, but then it stops drawing graphs, so you have to use rrdtool manually to draw the graphs), and rrdtool is way extended version of mrtg, which is both more complex to use and full of features that you probably want

[14:16:54] <silv3r_m00n4> is it possible to use irc using same id from multiple machines ?
[14:17:13] <jim> oldgalileo, to do that, modules for anything special (like if / is an lvm volume, or on a raid) would be in the initrd
[14:17:19] <xx> silv3r_m00n4: yes, setup a bouncer and connect to the bouncer

[14:23:07] <jim> yeah, it could be symlinked, or be the node that is to be mounted... maybe it's a udev rule that creates it

[14:28:31] <p`> like the reason there's often a root= or real_root= or whatever on the cmdline is to know what needs to be mounted ro before getting to the fstab part, and hence what drivers need to be there to find that device.  but it's true, that this kind of question could be further down the line
[14:28:35] <oldgalileo> So it's handled by the kernel as opposed to being brought up by anything. I'm still unclear as to why it would get cleaned up, but this answers my questions 😄

[15:15:12] <bullgard4> doctor_who, Your argument is not convincing. Most DEB program packages in Debian do not follow the capitalization pattern for what you called a "software". Take as a counter example the DEB program package »mpv«: '~$ apt-cache show mpv'.
[15:15:13] <Adoi> ?
[15:15:40] <Adoi> also I have only "bind" in the command, should it be "rbind" ?
[15:16:02] <iomari891> greetings, A colleague of mine just accidentally deleted some important files in midnight commander. Is there any way o earth to get the back?
[15:17:44] <rascul> bullgard4 the name of the package follows the debian package naming guidelines linked earlier, the name of the software the package installs isn't bound to that
[15:18:28] <valderen> iomari891: Ouch! He/she even went passed the Delete confirmation dialog
[15:18:48] <rascul> bullgard4 i don't have a debian handy to check apt-cache but mpv is both the correct capitalization for both mpv the debian package and mpv the software from https://mpv.io

[20:01:41] <dostoyevsky2> rcm888: linux isn't really driver friendly... normally you have to download the version of the driver that was made for your kernel version... if you download a random driver, you have upgrade/downgrade to the expected kernel version

[21:09:00] <hexnewbie> larry: It's possible that hb_subset_input_set_retain_gid is harfbuzz. Mismatch between the version of harfbuzz (or other library) that is installed, and the version of the same library with which the packager compiled chromium with.

[21:11:00] <hexnewbie> loginaginagin: 0. Like I said, switching GTK to KDE file picker is the only straightforward thing one can do without writing their own portal. 1. You need to install a portal for your DE. 2. For a GTK browser, e.g. Firefox, you close Firefox, and then run “GTK_USE_PORTAL=1 firefox”, and voilà, it's using your DE's file picker, instead of GTKs (* certain conditions apply)

[21:36:23] <Adoi> hexnewbie, if you mean the cloning, yes, it was completed. the process ended with the usual dd output, "x bits in, y bits out..."

[21:43:23] <Adoi> djph, got that lesson long ago :)

[21:46:36] <defjam> what is that about
[21:46:38] <jim> Adoi, one thing, you shouldn't use image clone (imaging a filesystem with dd), you should use a file-by-file copy method

[23:09:21] <TheGuestMovie> This is just for curiosity.  let's say I'm making an AppImage. Given my earlier scenario (Debian 10+11, Ubuntu 18.04 + 20.04 + 21.04, Red Hat 7 and 8, OpenSUSE whatever, Archbtw), how should I go about it? Here's what I think (based on my very limited experience): start development from the oldest one (in terms of glibc version I guess), copy all
[23:09:22] <TheGuestMovie> libraries listed by ldd to my AppImage directory and set it to use that. If I do this what % chance do I have from making my stuff built from an old distro like say, Red Hat 7, run on the just-released Debian 11?

[23:35:00] <msiism> Hasn't Ubuntu always been modern?
[23:35:17] <lopid> first time i've looked at it in a few years
[23:35:37] <Dan39> lopid: well it all depends on what version/flavor you install
[23:35:45] <pocketprotector> i have a very old imac that i installed lubuntu on for our kitchen pc and it works great.
[23:35:47] <Dan39> you can install a server version or minimal version
[23:36:03] <Dan39> or like xubuntu or lubuntu are probably pretty light
[23:36:35] <pocketprotector> xubuntu is good too. its the only computer i have ubuntu installed on, but ive been happy with it overall
[23:36:57] <pocketprotector> i like the dist-upgrade commands, wish other distros would use that.
