[06:03:52] <ayecee> right, both appear as usb mass storage devices

[09:12:00] <Haxxa> There is a command run by root via php that calls chmod 600 (yes in so many ways horrible), I want that command to not affect a file, is there anyway to lock a files permissions so even a command run as root won't affect it, ACLs or the like?

[17:30:16] <labrador> They are required for anything kde
[17:30:27] <Dasein> Wouldn't it be interesting if every distro was as different as Android is to Ubuntu? Then they would be different operating systems. Otherwise just a flavor or spin to me, Like what is Fedora? Just a Linux base that pulls updates from redhat and community? (Not taking a shot, Just trying to explain more about distros being an odd thing to me)
[17:30:33] <Dan39> have there been any major PDF feature additions in the past like 10 years? if not, for a really useable desktop i think you may just have to get the last version of acroread, or maybe adobe reader in wine? i don't know, but some people still send me PDF forms that just won't work in anything on linux
[17:30:42] <hexnewbie> D_Andrew: That's the most useless metrics to compare two PDF viewers. For starters, if you were comparing performance, you'd see how they fair at opening and navigating a 300 MB PDF.

[23:51:43] <Dan39> anyone know why since a recent metacity update when i use it standalone with --no-composite the windows have a thick squared off border around them? the older version would have nice rounded top edges and the border was like a single pixel line
[23:52:21] <Dan39> and how to change it obviously
[23:52:42] <Dan39> maybe it's just the theme...
[23:52:56] <Dan39> when compositing is on it looks good though

[23:53:17] <Dan39> in the older version it looked the same with both compositing on and off, it just lost the shadows around windows when it was off
