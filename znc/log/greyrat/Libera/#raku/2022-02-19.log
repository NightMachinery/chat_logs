[20:47:35] <guifa> nine: I'm not opposed to that at all.  I just don't really understand the compile process itself well enough to be of much use.  If someone could walk me through the process for making one of the nodes, maybe I can be of more use there.  I just feel bad asking for someone to basically give me a deep dive tutorial
[20:55:14] <lizmat> guifa: I did give a presentation about just that at FOSDEM :-)

[22:01:42] <guifa> lizmat no... I mean, I want to help out with RakuAST
[22:01:53] <guifa> node = RakuAST::Node
[22:01:57] <lizmat> aaah... ok...  right
[22:02:06] <lizmat> ok... yes, that would be excellent  :-)
[22:02:20] <lizmat> and I did *not* give a presentation about that on FOSDEM  :-)
[22:03:52] <guifa> Like, i get how the RakuAST nodes piece together, but it's converting them to work with Rakudo (which it seems like just converts RakuAST nodes to QAST nodes, but I know there's not a 1:1 correlation there, and there's a lot of other stuff that goes on). 
[22:05:04] <lizmat> fwiw, I'm not 100% clear on that either, and I think that part is also not 100% clear in jnthn's mind  :-)
[22:05:12] <lizmat> the goal is to eliminate World.nqp
[22:05:21] <lizmat> that much I know
[22:05:54] <lizmat> so somehow all of the functionality in there, will need to be "objectified" in such a way that it can all live in RakuAST nodes
[22:05:58] <lizmat> is my understanding  :-)
[22:06:57] <guifa> yeah, so â€¦Â I dunno what I can do to help out with RakuAST other than try to break it hahahahahaha.  But I'd be absolutely willing to help out if I know what to do 
[22:07:19] <lizmat> writing tests is something that I've run behind on
[22:07:28] <lizmat> so if you could pick that up, that would be brill
[22:07:38] <lizmat> it's in a way trying to break it  :-)
[22:08:34] <guifa> ah okay.  That I can do.  Those test cases were actually amazing for me figuring out how to do RakuAST
[22:08:55] <guifa> and I saw a few areas where I felt like I could add some stuff
[22:09:10] <lizmat> yeah, so please do!  :-)
[22:09:23] <guifa> (and, I think, a few where things changed because jnhtn switched from single positional to multi named args)
[22:09:24] <lizmat> you're probably way into it more than I was  :-
[22:09:25] <lizmat> )
[22:09:33] <lizmat> yup...
[22:11:50] <guifa> on a slightly unrelated noteâ€¦ crazy thing with my slang work is I've now found about four different ways for one grammar to embed into another.  I should probably mention all four of them in the problem-solving post.  They're all quite similar and feel like TIMTOWTDI overkill
[22:13:09] <guifa> <.LANG(Grammar)>, <nibble: â€¦>, <Grammar::TOP>, method foo { return Grammar.subparse }
[22:13:40] <guifa> oh, and :lang(foo) but I think that ended up as NYI from design docs
