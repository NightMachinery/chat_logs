[00:35:57] <kevinnn> So high level question... so I have an apache webserver running on docker. I only forwarded port 80 to the docker instance. However I know that http will negotiate another port to communicate with a client on. If the new port is say 64000, how does this traffic make its way to my docker instance? Given that only traffic on port 80 will make it to

[00:42:12] <kevinnn> out of curiosity, why?

[00:43:05] <tabakhase> hiya "ghost" some particular pice of software? -- and no docker doesnt rly block anything, but "docker containers" arent full systems (so maildrop for example does nothing) and then "mail in docker" itself is a little convioluted topic...

[01:41:28] <tabakhase> for the cases where one would do that - youd usually bindmount the config in from the host or such for example

[01:41:54] <Aavar> WHat does bindmount mean?
[01:42:06] <control-z> A directory on your host appears inside the container
[01:42:16] <control-z> Its mounted into it
[01:42:23] <tabakhase> -v / volume: with "a path" -- shipping a directory/file from outside to inside
[01:42:35] <Aavar> ahh... ok. And that is configured when you run the container?
[01:42:38] <tabakhase> path opposed to "a name"
[01:42:54] <Aavar> (the mount I mean)
[01:42:55] <tabakhase> its a little odd, but the "difference there" is just if it starts with "/" or not :D
[01:44:19] *** Quits: brandonkal (~brandonka@user/brandonkal) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[01:45:49] <tabakhase> but there isnt rly a generic answer - many ways and usually the image-author has a few words whats expected/supported depending on what you want to change
[01:47:33] <tabakhase> so, more detail what you wanne change on apache? - but sites-enabled and conf.d or a 2-line Dockerfile with some `sed` usually do the deal :P
[01:52:04] <Aavar> tabakhase: I'm just trying to understand the basics :) Apache was just an example. I am actually trying to set up thelounge
[01:52:32] <control-z> Ah I've set up thelounge with docker in the past, let me quickly check how I did it
[01:53:21] <Aavar> control-z: I think the .thelounge dir on the host is mounted to the container...
[01:53:41] <control-z> You can do that if you want to continue using your current setup
[01:53:58] <control-z> If the mounted directory is empty, the lounge will automatically fill it with the default config, as it would in a regular installation
[01:54:30] <control-z> Also, I really recommend using a docker-compose.yml file instead of running it with docker run.
[01:54:39] <Aavar> control-z: If I understand correctly that is was the official instructions calls for. https://thelounge.chat/docs/install-and-upgrade#docker
[01:55:05] <control-z> Do you already have the lounge installed?
[01:55:10] <control-z> Like bare-metal
[01:55:32] <Aavar> control-z: yes, but on a different server (snap)
[01:55:53] <control-z> Do you want a fresh start or are you planning to copy over the config
[01:56:00] <tabakhase> --volume = longform of -v - and the "~" gets turned t /home/bla or whatever from your shell (so then docker sees "starts with /" and bindmounts)
[01:56:39] <Aavar> control-z: I am trying to copy the config. I just need to find it first (snaps are confusing :))
[01:56:45] <tabakhase> notably, if the dir does not exist on the host docker-daemon will create it -- not everything can cope with this! (especially when ran with --user)
[01:56:59] <tabakhase> (cope cause owner=root then)
[01:57:19] <control-z> Also the link you linked contains a link to a docker-compose.yml file which contains the same setup as the docker run command
[01:57:31] <Aavar> I understand :)

[14:22:04] <molt> Hey all. I've been searching for this, but haven't really found one satisfactory answer: what is the best practice for backing up Docker containers?
[14:23:04] *** Joins: cotko (~cotko@89-212-138-82.static.t-2.net)
[14:24:37] <tabakhase> molt what do you define as container? and what backup? --- to some extend that answer is "not" ;D - what you backup may be the env-instructions (compose file, .env file and there like) AND "your actual data" in its "best" form (maybe a tar.gz, maybe run borg on a volume, or an actual mysqldump (opposed to "files from disk") so there isnt rly a generic answer...
[14:26:22] <molt> ... a Container in Docker is a container created from a docker image either with docker-run or docker-compose...
[14:26:48] <molt> a Backup is an extra copy that can be used in case of a data corruption, failure, etc.
[14:26:51] <molt> ...
[14:28:01] <molt> standing containers back up from docker-run or docker-compose files is easy enough. making sure the data is backed up is another thing. 
[14:28:08] <molt> I feel like this is getting very weedy
[14:28:35] <tabakhase> the "what backup" is more on the idea that "its a different problem to solve when a) someone deleting a wrong line in the database, or b) your datacenter burning to the ground over night"
[14:28:47] <molt> I'm just asking if there are any nice guides with best practices around backing up docker. all the weeds should be in the guide
[14:30:10] <tabakhase> containers themself "should be kinda stateless" in the end ((and for the ones that cant, volumes)) - and if it dies, you just recreate it elsewhere --- so "docker or bare metal" ends up beeing all the same in the end, no fancy "oneclick" rly
[14:31:18] <molt> fine. but database information needs to be kept, and that doesn't happen if a machine acting as the docker host just goes belly-up, right?
[14:31:29] <tabakhase> so its pretty much a "refeer to the instructions for the particular pice of software" in one way, while also "well, just save all volumes" on the other hand

[14:32:18] <tabakhase> problem with "just save all volumes" is that this may or may not work well (as its basically a crash-recovery after a power-cable pull then) 
[14:33:15] <tabakhase> for "how to save a volume" see examples&notes here https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/#backup-restore-or-migrate-data-volumes - the short is "you run another container with $backuptool on that same volume"

[19:11:51] <leitz> I'm getting back into docker, and my app doesn't seem to connect when queried by the host node's web browser. What am I missing?    https://gist.github.com/LeamHall/d1d6cf98189b68631077ba2eaae3dc98
[19:12:43] <leitz> Does the app need to specify the image's actual IP address (172.17.0.2)? Or can that be done without.
[19:14:40] <selckin> only 80% sure but that'll work when inside docker you listen on 0.0.0.0
[19:15:04] <selckin> maybe if you explictly do the port binding with 8000:127.0.0.1:8000 it'll work too, not sure

[19:18:34] <ada_> leitz: its hard to know what your container's IP address is going to be before the container gets created, so your app should bind to 0.0.0.0 within the container, and then when you deploy your container, publish port 8000 which looks like the functional port for your app

[22:00:26] <deuxexmachina> yes this is confusing me about the env var COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/12144/whats-new-in-docker-compose-v2/
[22:00:36] <deuxexmachina> does that env var still work if you put it in .env ?

[23:48:20] <znf> Hi.
[23:48:42] <znf> Is there a way to somehow represent the "host" (as an IP address/hostname) in a docker compose file?
[23:49:02] <znf> ie: I want to pass DB_HOST=the-actual-host 
[23:49:24] <ada_> what's your host's IP address?
[23:49:33] <ada_> what's your host's DNS name on your LAN's DNS server?
[23:49:48] <ada_> znf: ^
[23:50:13] <znf> I don't have one on my LAN, wasn't planning on using a public IP address :) 
[23:50:19] <ada_> ok well
[23:50:25] <ada_> those are the answers
[23:50:46] <znf> Is there no variable anywhere that it can just point to the docker0 IP address on the host?
[23:51:11] <ada_> you can set one in your shell
[23:51:12] *** Joins: acovrig (~acovrig@host-173-247-7-127.JENOLT2.epbfi.com)
[23:51:53] <znf> nevermind, apparently you can just use "host.docker.internal" 
[23:52:01] <ada_> you can with certain implementations of docker
[23:52:10] <ada_> docker desktop for win and mac support that but docker itself doesn't
[23:52:18] <ada_> it's a feature of "desktop" 
[23:52:42] <DoofusCanadensis> feels a little like an X-Y question
[23:52:44] <ada_> but compose doesn't do anything here
[23:52:47] <ada_> its not a compose feature
[23:52:52] <znf> DoofusCanadensis, it's really not
[23:53:22] <DoofusCanadensis> I mean, I certainly don't understand why the host matters
[23:53:24] <ada_> I don't read it that way but asking if it's Compose related is a red herring.  No, definitively, there is nothing in the Compose syntax that does this.
[23:54:07] <ada_> docker desktop for mac & win have some userland magic that turns 'host.docker.internal' into your host's IP address but that isn't a docker engine feature or a compose feature
[23:54:27] <znf> DoofusCanadensis, I stated what I wanted to do - run the mysql server on the bare host, don't want to pass it trough the public network, basically my question is if there's any way to automatically pass the docker0 IP address in a way that I don't have to actually enter "172.17.0.1" (in my case)
[23:54:43] <znf> DoofusCanadensis, well, I need to connect to the mysql server, how would it not matter? :)
[23:54:58] <DoofusCanadensis> oh, I didn't see that detail earlier
[23:55:53] <DoofusCanadensis> [13:19:02]  <znf> ie: I want to pass DB_HOST=the-actual-hostÂ <-- or was I supposed to infer it from this?
[23:56:19] <DoofusCanadensis> i'd go with the hosts hostname... I believe docker exposes that internally
[23:58:38] <akik> znf: you can get the info with ip command in the container "ip route show 0/0"
[23:59:02] <znf> it's fine, I'll juse use 172.17.0.1
