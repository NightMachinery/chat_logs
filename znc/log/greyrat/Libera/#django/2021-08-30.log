[08:04:44] <FunkyBob> erm... what?
[08:05:04] <wallbroken> do you know the design of my application?
[08:05:11] <wallbroken> *remember
[08:05:39] <wallbroken> i have each item instance bounded in an m2m relationship to each user
[08:05:49] <FunkyBob> the one that needed to track orders but you refused to add an order model?
[08:06:12] <wallbroken> you told me that this is wrong because i need to bound an user to an order, not to an item
[08:06:29] <wallbroken> but SUPPOSE that i want to track the order for every single object
[08:06:38] <FunkyBob> still need an order record
[08:06:39] <wallbroken> in that case, using m2m, is the right solution?
[08:06:50] <FunkyBob> problem with using a m2m is it doesn't store ENOUGH iinformation
[08:07:11] <FunkyBob> i did describe to y ou before how your would structure this
[08:07:13] <wallbroken> but in my model i use more than 1 m2m field
[08:07:30] <FunkyBob> a User would create an Order, which would be fulfilled by a Vendor
[08:07:49] <wallbroken> https://github.com/ClaudioViti/lookbook/blob/multi-user/shoes/models.py#L131
[08:07:53] <wallbroken> 131-136
[08:07:58] <FunkyBob> who would create Shipment records which would be the first time you would know the individual shoe's ID
[08:08:45] <FunkyBob> with this, y ou can now track every order, by every user, how and when they were shipped, and which items were shipped to that user, and when
[08:08:58] <FunkyBob> and, I think, with no m2m fields
[08:09:13] <FunkyBob> but I suspect you're going to decline this design, because it means doing rework

[08:10:41] <FunkyBob> you just proposed that you DO want to track every item

[08:12:34] <audiocat> FunkyBob, https://bpa.st/2TMQ
[08:12:51] <audiocat> FunkyBob, django is not recognizing my custom auth backend either
[08:12:57] <audiocat> it's in AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS though
[08:12:59] <FunkyBob> 02:52 < FunkyBob> problem with using a m2m is it doesn't store ENOUGH iinformation

[08:14:56] <FunkyBob> you've shown you're not willing to change your code to correct the data schema
[08:15:01] <FunkyBob> so it's pointless discussing it
[08:15:19] <FunkyBob> you based it on lies, and surprise! it t urned out wrong
[08:15:43] <FunkyBob> audiocat: looks like it's trying to test your password field as a standard django password field...
[08:15:53] <audiocat> FunkyBob, yes
[08:16:01] <audiocat> FunkyBob, how can i get it to notice my custom auth backend
[08:16:12] <audiocat> let me show you my code
[08:16:28] <FunkyBob> it is... it retrieved your record... but your record doesn't work in a stock django User class
[08:16:34] <FunkyBob> because it uses its own password hash format
[08:16:50] <FunkyBob> https://bpa.st/2TMQ#1L37

[08:17:52] <audiocat> it's not even supposed to be using that func
[08:18:21] <FunkyBob> ok
[08:18:25] <FunkyBob> am looking at the source now
[08:19:06] <FunkyBob> and you've any proof your class is being called at all?
[08:19:27] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: you missed the point to discuss on
[08:19:37] <FunkyBob> audiocat: take all the other backends out, when testing
[08:19:40] <audiocat> FunkyBob, on further inspection i dont think it is. i have a custom adapter
[08:19:43] <wallbroken> i'm just trying to understand if my actual model is good
[08:19:51] <FunkyBob> 02:45 < wallbroken> FunkyBob: in the case of wanting to track EVERY SINGLE ITEM, my m2m solution is right?
[08:20:02] <audiocat> FunkyBob, the adapter subclasses this class: https://github.com/pennersr/django-allauth/blob/master/allauth/account/adapter.py
[08:20:10] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: I still think your design is fundamentally wrong, and you are not saying anything yet to change my mind
[08:20:13] <audiocat> DefaultAccountAdapter
[08:20:38] <FunkyBob> what is this adapter thing for?
[08:21:10] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: is wrong for one specific requirement
[08:21:13] <wallbroken> not for all of them
[08:22:12] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: well, my next question is going to be for some clear requirements...
[08:22:22] <FunkyBob> but again, that seems to mystify you, so...
[08:22:42] <audiocat> FunkyBob, to not allow new user signups
[08:22:44] <FunkyBob> audiocat: as I've mentioned, I've never used allauth
[08:22:58] <FunkyBob> audiocat: ok... what is the adapter for? how does it 'allow new user signups'?
[08:24:04] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: i can't comment  on if m2m is the right choice without understanding what the system needs to provide
[08:24:15] <audiocat> FunkyBob, it looks like it handles just about everything related to authentication. but i'm not sure, i haven't really made a deep dive into the code. i've just been using it with a cursory understanding because it's super simple to implement
[08:24:31] <FunkyBob> audiocat: tell me again what it is you added allauth for?
[08:24:57] <audiocat> so i wouldn't have to write any code for signups/login system FunkyBob
[08:25:08] <audiocat> it was out of pure laziness and familiarity
[08:25:48] <FunkyBob> ...
[08:25:56] <FunkyBob> how's that working out for ya? :P
[08:26:10] <FunkyBob> login is built into django
[08:26:18] <FunkyBob> as is logout, and password reset / password change
[08:26:29] <FunkyBob> what signup workflow did you want?
[08:27:25] <FunkyBob> audiocat: ?
[08:27:45] <FunkyBob> i might have an easy solution for you, but you need to answer me
[08:27:47] <audiocat> FunkyBob, so allauth is really good for adding social media auth to your app
[08:28:03] <FunkyBob> audiocat: honestly, no idea.
[08:28:06] <audiocat> and it has templates already made for authentication
[08:28:10] <FunkyBob> that _seems_ to be what it can bring
[08:28:13] <audiocat> django does not
[08:28:18] <FunkyBob> of course it doesn't
[08:28:20] <audiocat> saves like 10 hours
[08:28:26] <FunkyBob> ah, bullshit it does
[08:28:41] <FunkyBob> if it takes  you 10 hours to write a few simple templates, there's something really wrong
[08:28:59] <audiocat> ok maybe not 10 hours, but a considerable amount of time
[08:29:45] <FunkyBob> time you'll spend anyway, because no off-the-shelf template would look right in your custom site
[08:30:01] <audiocat> ah
[08:30:29] <FunkyBob> meanwhile, none of this is answering my question
[08:31:23] <audiocat> oh
[08:31:26] <audiocat> no signup workflow
[08:31:33] <audiocat> no new users allowed
[08:31:43] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: well, the idea of "ordere" it isn't
[08:31:52] <wallbroken> the order is for single item
[08:32:50] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: when did that change?
[08:33:11] <FunkyBob> even so, having an order record is useful to track that the request was made, and fulfilled
[08:35:10] <FunkyBob> audiocat: out of curiosity.... how many hours, would you say, have you pumped into using allauth?
[08:35:26] <audiocat> less than 1 for this project
[08:35:44] <audiocat> only needed to work with it to disable signups
[08:35:53] <audiocat> well
[08:35:58] <audiocat> now i need to work with it again
[08:36:01] <audiocat> so the clock is ticking
[08:36:32] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: i told you"let's suppose"
[08:36:41] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: yes, and I supposed
[08:37:13] <FunkyBob> and now you seem to be telling me i'm wrong, but still won't provide details
[08:37:25] <wallbroken> i told you the details
[08:37:28] <audiocat> FunkyBob, i'm going to overwrite the `authenticate` func in the default adapter
[08:37:38] <wallbroken> i just want to provide an order system for each item
[08:37:44] <audiocat> to use the `authenticate` function in my custom backend rather than django's default one
[08:37:49] <audiocat> and we'll see how that works
[08:38:08] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: "just".... heh... yeah right
[08:38:50] <FunkyBob> except for all the other details
[08:39:40] <FunkyBob> describe the business process, then we can formulate a proper schema to model it
[08:40:58] <FunkyBob> part of how you got yourself into this mess was by (a) not getting details on the full process, and (b) modelling something ELSE
[08:41:22] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: FIRST, i'm going to explain you what the goal of this discussion is
[08:41:42] <wallbroken> i'm trying to understand if the current implemented design is right
[08:42:35] <FunkyBob> to do that you need to explain the business process and needs
[08:42:43] <FunkyBob> i keep asking for it... you keep ignoring me
[08:42:55] <wallbroken> give me the time...
[08:43:02] <FunkyBob> you've had 5 months
[08:43:20] <wallbroken> let's suppose that the user wants to order 5 items
[08:43:46] <wallbroken> those 5 order must be unrelated
[08:43:50] <FunkyBob> 5 of the same item?
[08:43:56] <FunkyBob> why must they be unrelated?
[08:44:13] <wallbroken> in the sense you wan't have an "order session"
[08:44:18] <FunkyBob> why?
[08:44:24] <FunkyBob> what is an "order session"?
[08:44:31] <wallbroken> please, don't discuss my requirements
[08:44:39] <wallbroken> requirements are requirements
[08:44:40] <FunkyBob> then I can't help  you
[08:44:52] <wallbroken> order session means puts item in the order cart
[08:44:53] <FunkyBob> I need to understand the requirements
[08:44:57] <FunkyBob> ok
[08:44:59] <wallbroken> understand yes
[08:45:11] <wallbroken> but not tell "i don't support that requirement"
[08:45:39] *** Joins: fortuno51 (~fortuno51@37.120.156.254)
[08:45:40] <FunkyBob> haven't suggested that at all yet
[08:46:22] <wallbroken> so, each item order is indipendent from the others
[08:46:27] *** Quits: Kalov (~Thunderbi@179.56.117.154) (Quit: Kalov)
[08:46:51] <wallbroken> the other requirement is that each item object is different
[08:46:56] <FunkyBob> again... why?
[08:46:58] <wallbroken> it has its own serial number
[08:46:59] <wallbroken> ...
[08:47:05] <wallbroken> please, don't discuss requirements
[08:47:10] <FunkyBob> ...
[08:47:21] <FunkyBob> If I don't know why, I don't understand them.
[08:47:35] <FunkyBob> as I've explained many times before it's not the ORDER that needs to know the serial #
[08:47:42] <wallbroken> it's irrelevant why for technical side implementation
[08:47:43] <FunkyBob> it's the SHIPMENT or FULFILLMENT
[08:47:52] <FunkyBob> ok... well... goodnight, then
[08:48:12] <wallbroken> because we have never multiple stocks of the same item
[08:48:16] <wallbroken> that's the reason
[08:48:26] <FunkyBob> that doesn't make sense, nor does it explain why
[08:48:45] <wallbroken> i'm not the customer's business manager
[08:48:58] <FunkyBob> so?
[08:49:02] <wallbroken> and i don't care why they have only 1 peace for every SKY
[08:49:05] <wallbroken> SKU
[08:49:14] <wallbroken> but why do you care thta?
[08:49:18] <FunkyBob> ...
[08:49:19] <wallbroken> that's not clear
[08:49:20] <FunkyBob> so I can understand
[08:49:33] <FunkyBob> I can't model a system I don't understand
[08:50:09] <FunkyBob> also, I think you're mixing in your solution with your description of the problem
[08:50:23] <FunkyBob> you're saying 'each ordered item must be recorded separately'... that sounds like solution, not problem
[08:50:31] <FunkyBob> without a why, it's just bad
[08:50:45] <FunkyBob> i've shown you how you can avoid that...
[08:50:56] <FunkyBob> but as always, you ignore most of what I tell you
[08:52:47] <wallbroken> i told you that each item order must be unrelated from the other
[08:53:24] <FunkyBob> yes, but not why
[08:53:25] <wallbroken> each time an order of 1 item has been made, an email comes to server
[08:53:34] <wallbroken> if i order 10 items, 10 emails comes
[08:53:39] <wallbroken> now it's clear?
[08:53:50] <FunkyBob> no
[08:53:54] <wallbroken> it will not be created a single email containing 10 items
[08:54:04] <FunkyBob> why did this change?
[08:54:12] <wallbroken> this is a way to describe you the fact that each order is unrelated to the others
[08:54:23] <FunkyBob> no, this is describing your existing implementation
[08:54:25] <FunkyBob> not the problem
[08:54:28] <FunkyBob> not the requirements
[08:54:33] <wallbroken> oh, man. i give up. i'ts hard to me speaking in english
[08:54:34] <FunkyBob> I need the WHY
[08:54:44] <wallbroken> and you don't make any effort in understading what i say
[08:54:47] <FunkyBob> I do
[08:54:56] <FunkyBob> Why must the emails be separate?
[08:55:09] <FunkyBob> Why must the ordered items be separate, just because the emails are separate?
[08:55:44] <wallbroken> don't get that. it's just a way to say, each item is UNRELATED from the other. that's why i don't need a order idea
[08:55:53] <FunkyBob> but they're not unrelated
[08:55:59] <FunkyBob> they were all ordered during the one ordering session
[08:56:02] <FunkyBob> you said yourself
[08:56:11] <FunkyBob> you do need an order
[08:56:23] <FunkyBob> because you need to track that (a) someone asked for the item, and (b) someone sent them the item
[08:56:26] <wallbroken> when you think to an order, you imagine like in amazon, where you select item to buy, and then in the cart you make "purchase"
[08:56:33] <FunkyBob> no, YOU think that
[08:57:02] <wallbroken> in fact i track who asked the item
[08:57:05] <wallbroken> using m2m fields
[08:57:17] <FunkyBob> yes, but that doesn't tell you WHEN they ordered it, for instance
[08:57:22] <FunkyBob> or if it's been fulfilled
[08:57:26] <FunkyBob> or if the ordered it again
[08:57:40] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: yes, it does
[08:57:55] <wallbroken> i have delivered, ordered, cart
[08:57:55] <FunkyBob> an order would record that very easily, very neatly,
[08:58:01] <wallbroken> all m2m fields
[08:58:37] <FunkyBob> sure, that gives you _some_ of the functionality of an Order model, with a fuck-tonne more complexity
[08:58:47] <FunkyBob> why not do it the easy way?
[08:59:12] <FunkyBob> also, with your m2m solution, how do you track _re_ordering an item?
[08:59:55] <wallbroken> what do you mean by "_re_ordering" ?
[09:00:38] <FunkyBob> you ordered something, you got it... nwo you need another one
[09:00:55] <wallbroken> ...
[09:01:09] <FunkyBob> or is this where you tell me you can never order the same SKU twice?
[09:01:11] <wallbroken> i told you that you have one item per SKU
[09:01:18] <FunkyBob> that's nonsense
[09:01:33] <FunkyBob> every single item in stock is unique?
[09:01:35] <wallbroken> but why should I discuss business requirements?
[09:01:37] <wallbroken> why?
[09:01:44] <FunkyBob> because by knowing business requirements
[09:01:49] <FunkyBob> we know the problems we are trying to solve!
[09:02:37] <FunkyBob> if the business doesn't need to know who ordered what when, or how many times...
[09:02:43] <FunkyBob> then we won't model a way to record that
[09:03:16] <FunkyBob> anyway, I'm going for a walk
[09:03:36] <wallbroken> the business needs to know who ordered the item. WHEN is no so important

[15:33:15] <duoi> cusco i still dont entirely understand what you mean. if you want to have a soft alias you can just create a method on the model with the name that you want that returns the attribute you want, and stick @property on top to access it
[15:34:17] <duoi> https://dpaste.org/NyS0
[15:34:19] <duoi> somehting like this
[15:34:40] <duoi> you can't query against that though, it's just when accessing attributes on an object
[15:35:10] <nedbat> in a TestClient test, I want to do two posts, but in separate transactions, so the second one sees the results of the first. how do I do that?
[15:35:28] <duoi> what you're describing, otherwise, is to add a db_column='column_name' attribute and call the column something different to the attribute

[15:59:44] <moldy> nedbat: are you talking about one TestClient method or two?
[16:00:01] <nedbat> moldy: one TestClient object, calling .post a few times
[16:00:13] <moldy> nedbat: ah i confused TestClient with TestCase, sorry
[16:00:21] <moldy> nedbat: pretty sure that this should just work
[16:01:59] <moldy> i often do a POST followed by a GET in tests, i never had to do anything special to ensure the GET sees the change
[16:02:19] <moldy> i'd check if the code path for the POST is failing to save the data for some reason
[16:03:32] <moldy> nedbat: but we're talking about one TestCase method, right? between test method calls, the db is reset
[16:04:03] <nedbat> moldy: yes, one test case (though with pytest-django). I think i understand now. I'm querying for the summary, then saving the model, so the summary is behind.
[16:04:21] <moldy> ah, ok

[17:54:40] <Croves> Hey friends! I have a custom UserCreationForm where I don't want the user to register with a username. In fact, I want username to be the same as e-mail. In my Form, I don't have the `username` in the fields - how can I rewrite form_valid() to set username = email ?

[18:18:39] <Diemuzi> Croves: You'll need a custom userModel, this will at least get you started in the right direction -> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/auth/customizing/
[18:19:18] <Croves> Diemuzi yeah actually I'm trying to avoid a custom usermodel
[18:19:24] <Croves> just want to have username the same as email
[18:19:27] <Diemuzi> GL then =)
[18:31:06] <shangxiao> Croves: I believe it should be possible to repurpose the username field for emails

[18:34:25] <shangxiao> Croves: just be aware that there's a validator on the core user model for username that checks for "Letters, digits and @/./+/-/_ only" ... I believe emails may contain more than this
[18:34:55] <shangxiao> there's a few ways you can sync up username & email: form level, model level or database level... take your pick :)

[22:42:08] <GinFuyou> e.g. traceback mentions AuthenticationMiddleware
[22:42:50] <cranktrain> So, there's a bit in the django docs that says:
[22:43:00] <cranktrain> "Importing AbstractBaseUser - AbstractBaseUser and BaseUserManager are importable from django.contrib.auth.base_user so that they can be imported without including django.contrib.auth in INSTALLED_APPS."
[22:44:08] <cranktrain> Django should, it seems, be fine with using bits from within contrib.auth, but you don't have to have it in the installed_apps. I'm afraid my understanding of the guts of django is too low to get all that happens when an app is in the list
[22:45:10] <cranktrain> I'd love to try and debug that AuthenticationMiddleware and figure out where my problem is coming from, since it doesn't seem to be emitting from any of my (pretty simple) apps. Just not quite sure how
[22:45:11] <GinFuyou> You can import abstract models but not concrete ones (without "installing" an app). Permission is a concrete model
[22:45:41] <cranktrain> Gotcha, and a middleware is trying to use it
[22:45:55] <GinFuyou> Maybe, I'm not sure.
[22:46:03] <GinFuyou> But something seems to import it
[22:46:45] <GinFuyou> So you should inspect it and either remove references or add auth
[22:46:53] <cranktrain> A quick 'Find All' search of my codebase doesn't show anything up. Going to have to dig further for a bit
[22:47:42] <cranktrain> Sadly, I named my own auth app... 'auth'. So I need to rename that before adding contrib.auth or I get a duplication error
[22:47:54] <GinFuyou> what auth backend do you use?
[22:48:01] <GinFuyou> ouch
[22:49:24] <cranktrain> Hmm, I don't know
[22:49:35] <cranktrain> Is AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS a new setting in settings.py? It's not in the settings I have
[22:50:08] <cranktrain> Just the default one, then?
