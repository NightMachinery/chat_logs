[02:40:53] <AmyMalik> if you're set on Open/LibreSSL, I'd ask the inventors of Open/LibreSSL what they think of the license. It's all well and good saying that CDDL is incompatible with GPL, but until it's challenged in court, we will never know.
[02:41:05] <AmyMalik> (Not that OpenSSL uses CDDL, but just as an example.)
[02:41:07] <iShareFreedom> that the apache 2.0 license is compatible with gpl3 does not mean that they are equal, as I said apache 2.0 is a weak license. does not include copyleft. xx
[02:41:43] <AmyMalik> There's a time and a place for copyfree.

[03:05:24] <corwin> publishing?  punishing.
[03:05:34] <yrk> the only good reason to avoid the gpl is if you've carefully considered the specific case at hand and decided that software freedom would in fact benefit from taking that action (which should be a rare occurance); rarely does the community benefit from _less_ protection

[07:40:04] <iShareFreedom> it is very redundant to say free/free/open software, better to say "free software" or in english is so hard the diference say "Software Libre" like us in spanish lenguage xd
[07:40:30] <iShareFreedom> opensource isnt a good term for speak about freedom. 
[07:41:05] <joepublic> "free/libre" is not redundant, in english; it distinguishes from free/gratis
[07:41:22] <iShareFreedom> but free software isnt gratis
[07:41:24] <iShareFreedom> that is wrong.
[07:41:28] <iShareFreedom> is about freedom not about price
[07:41:33] <joepublic> This is why we say free/libre.
[07:41:41] <Neopolitan> although free/libre software is also usually gratis
[07:41:43] <iShareFreedom> that is redundant
[07:41:49] <jxself> I think your dentist probably has something to say about "floss." :)
[07:41:58] <Neopolitan> It's not redundant, but you're being pedantic, iShareFreedom.
[07:42:06] <joepublic> I just explained that it differentiates between libre and gratis.
[07:42:29] <iShareFreedom> is completly redundant xD i know poor guys copyng english dudes speak "floss" in spanish

[07:45:04] <iShareFreedom> is a wrong way about speak about free software say floss or foss that say in this page. jxself i invite to  you to read it one more time 
[07:45:22] <iShareFreedom> is redundant, say free/libre software and opensource xD
[07:45:29] <iShareFreedom> becouse all free software have a public source code.
[07:45:35] <Neopolitan> you proved my point for me, thanks
[07:45:38] <iShareFreedom> becouse isnt about good code, like opensource say
[07:45:59] <Neopolitan> > Others use the term âFOSS,â which stands for âFree and Open Source Software.â This is meant to mean the same thing as âFLOSS,â but it is less clear, since it fails to explain that âfreeâ refers to freedom.

[07:47:15] <joepublic> "free/free" is not a thing.

[07:48:11] <iShareFreedom> if is so hard explain "free as in freedom" you can say "free/libre" but floss and foss isnt ridicolous redundant xD
[07:48:59] <iShareFreedom> for me, of course and for us but if you want to follow in the mistake there you. for more information please read again Neopolitan: https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.html
[07:49:01] <joepublic> well, floss isn't redundant.  Some "open source" software is also free software, and some isn't (due to inclusion of or dependency on nonfree software)
[07:49:11] <iShareFreedom> all free software have a public source code!
[07:49:15] <iShareFreedom> isnt a good code, is about freedom!
[07:49:28] <iShareFreedom> isnt about price! is about freedom so gratis isnt in the term!
[07:49:42] <Neopolitan> FLOSS = Free/Libre Open Source Software
[07:49:45] * Neopolitan thinking
[07:49:46] <iShareFreedom> is Free Software, or if is hard to learn it for you better say "free/Libre
[07:49:52] <iShareFreedom> that is redundant!
[07:49:56] <iShareFreedom> all free software have public source code!
[07:50:19] <Neopolitan> open source software also has public open code but may have closed-source dependencies
[07:50:40] <iShareFreedom> that is the idea about speak about freedom and not opensource!
[07:51:00] <Neopolitan> i need a second opinion. is this guy trolling me
[07:51:01] <iShareFreedom> so is more easy speak like us, like the GNU group or free software activist: Free/Libre
[07:51:26] <iShareFreedom> when we speak about freedom, you need speak about it, not about good code like opensource.
[07:51:37] <iShareFreedom> when we speak about freedom we dont speak about price.
[07:51:42] <joepublic> he's legit, in my opinion.  besides the language barrier, he's pretty anti opensource, which may or may not be laudable.
[07:52:09] <iShareFreedom> the best way for speaking about free software in english if is hard to learn it the defirent about free as in freedom, say "free/Libre"
[07:52:34] <iShareFreedom> opensource no defend the freedom af the users, they speak only about good code.
[07:52:34] <Neopolitan> iShareFreedom: We've been talking about the same thing this whole time, you're just having difficulty understanding, most likely, due to your lack of familiarity with the English language.
[07:52:52] <iShareFreedom> free as in freedom, isnt about price 
[07:52:54] <iShareFreedom> isnt about good code.
[07:52:58] <iShareFreedom> is about freedom 
[07:53:04] <Neopolitan> but we prefer the code to be good too *
[07:53:11] <iShareFreedom> that is trivial
[07:53:11] <joepublic> do you, perchance, have input into the question about single sign-on solutions?
[07:53:18] <Neopolitan> I do not, sorry.
[07:53:25] <iShareFreedom> free software have a good code, but that is trivial like richard stallman say it.
[07:53:58] <iShareFreedom> isnt about good code, is about freedom/libertad
[07:54:10] <joepublic> good or bad code is not the point of freedom, however it's nice when free code is good code also.
[07:54:23] <iShareFreedom> is about libre software is about freedom not price, not good code, if have a price or not of have a good code or not is a simple trivial thing.
[07:54:47] <iShareFreedom> software libre is good becouse respect your freedom. not for a good code becouse good code is a simply trivial thing.
[07:55:05] <iShareFreedom> but the software libre have a good code, becouse we respect your freedom to enhacement them
[07:55:17] <Neopolitan> the fsf doesn't need you to go to bat for them against me
[07:55:28] <iShareFreedom> isnt about good code, isnt about price, if have or not price or if have or not good code that is COMPLETLY TRIVIAL Neopolitan

[07:59:35] <joepublic> so you mentioned.
[07:59:49] <Neopolitan> people outside the movement think "free = gratis", so we need to ensure they are aware it is also "libre".
[07:59:56] <joepublic> I would congratulate you on your good understanding, but...
[08:00:31] <iShareFreedom> libre mean freedom in spanish
[08:00:41] <iShareFreedom> gratis in english is 0 price
[08:00:54] <joepublic> the percentage of english speakers who care about spanish is very, very small.

[08:03:03] <iShareFreedom> that isnt important becouse you can explain it
[08:03:14] <iShareFreedom> and say; yes, free software, but free as in freedom
[08:03:26] <iShareFreedom> becouse free software isnt about low price.
[08:03:29] <iShareFreedom> or hight price
[08:03:37] <joepublic> se depende del contexto.  "free beer", "cerveza gratis" -- "free people", "gente libre".
[08:03:42] <Neopolitan> What's faster to say: 1) FLOSS    2) free software free as in freedom.
[08:03:45] <iShareFreedom> you can be a good developper or a bad one but if u respect freedom you can write free software
[08:04:00] <iShareFreedom> is like FREE SPEACH not free beer.

[08:57:06] <sasano> most software companies offer proprietary licenses but not all
[08:58:51] <sasano> there are companies that sell support, administration, and hosting among others
[08:59:23] <sasano> while only using free licenses
[09:02:11] <clever> i'm currently working on a bootloader for the open pi firmware
[09:02:21] <sasano> But in general, companies actually do care about software freedom for themselves, I mean they want to be able to study ,use, modify, and redistribute their software, it's that they usually don't care whether the end user gets those freedoms
[09:02:28] <clever> when it passes control off to linux, it prints this msg, and then nothing else: Uncompressing Linux... done, booting the kernel.
[09:03:29] <clever> checking the linux source, i can see that TEXT_OFFSET is 0x8000, so it should be uncompressing itself to 32kb from the start of ram
[09:04:23] <belgin> if you see a software licensed as "gpl2 or later", does that mean you can consider it being under gpl3 as well?
[09:04:42] <belgin> clever, are you using u-boot?
[09:05:01] <clever> belgin: custom bootloader currently, the uboot hangs
[09:05:09] *** Quits: robin (~robin@user/terpri) (Remote host closed the connection)
[09:05:26] <clever> uboot expects certain things of the closed-source blob
[09:05:35] <clever> and i havent reproduced those features in the open blob
[09:05:55] <clever> https://github.com/librerpi/lk-overlay/blob/master/app/linux-bootloader/loader.c#L121-L133
[09:05:58] <clever> this is the core of the loader
[09:06:33] <clever> if i then hexdump addr 0x8000, i can see that it does not match that offset into the bootloader, so its definitely been overwritten
[09:06:59] <belgin> clever, i think TEXT_OFFSET just means where the "text" segment is in the kernel binary. you can load the linux image anywhere in ram and run it from there. just make sure there is no other device mapped there except for ram
[09:06:59] <clever> and if i compare to `armv7l-unknown-linux-gnueabihf-objdump -dS ./vmlinux | less`, its a match
[09:07:27] <clever> c0008000 <stext>:
[09:07:27] <clever> c0008000:       eb03fd26        bl      c01074a0 <__hyp_stub_install>
[09:08:09] <clever> belgin: i think TEXT_OFFSET being 0x8000, is there so the uncompressed kernel image is 32kb off of a major alignment point, just like the virtual addr is 32kb off
[09:08:23] *** Joins: robin (~robin@user/terpri)
[09:08:26] <clever> so it can freely use bigger pages to map itself
[09:08:39] <sasano> belgin, "gpl2 or later" means that is probably licensed under gplv2 buy allows you to combine it with later versions
[09:09:03] <clever> https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/blob/rpi-5.10.y/arch/arm/boot/compressed/head.S#L251-L273
[09:09:29] <clever> belgin: this code will round PC down to the nearest 128mb (kernel was loaded to 16mb from 0, so that rounds down to 0)
[09:09:41] <clever> it will then add 0x8000, and thats the dest of the uncompressed blob
[09:10:00] <clever> then it can map c0008000 virtual to 0x8000 physical, and they match up better
[09:10:09] <belgin> it's possible that if you load the kernel at 0x0, some other device is memory mapped there
[09:10:51] <clever> belgin: ive configured it so there are 2 MMIO windows, at 0x20000000 and 0x3f000000
[09:11:17] <belgin> at least in u-boot's case, i don't think it cares about virtual mapping. you just tell it to load at x and it loads it there
[09:11:46] <clever> there is a self-decompressing stub within a 32bit arm kernel
[09:12:07] <clever> when it uncompressed itself, it will round the PC down to the nearest 128mb, and then add 0x8000
[09:12:13] <clever> and dump the uncompressed kernel there
[09:12:32] <clever> that stub is fully PIC, so it doesnt care where uboot put things
[09:12:41] <belgin> oh ok
[09:12:43] <clever> as long as its within a given 128mb slot
[09:13:28] <clever> so if uboot dropped linux at +132mb, linux would unpack itself to 128mb + 0x8000
[09:13:53] <belgin> maybe it does boot, but it prints to the wrong serial port?
[09:14:13] <clever> https://github.com/librerpi/lk-overlay/blob/master/app/linux-bootloader/loader.c#L37-L38
[09:14:51] <clever> the earlycon for the decompression stub, was configured with CONFIG_DEBUG_UART_PHYS=0x3f201000
[09:14:59] <clever> which is how i saw what i pasted
[09:15:10] <belgin> how big is the uncompressed kernel? maybe it overwrites the dtb?

[09:44:24] <a1ncz> clever, does the proprietary bootloader load that same kernel successfully?
[09:44:58] <clever> a1ncz: the drivers to interface with the firmware break when loaded without that firmware
[09:45:10] <clever> so i have to build the kernel without the firmware drivers, to make it work
[09:45:24] <clever> so its not really cross-compatible between the 2 modes
[09:45:57] <clever> init/main.c:asmlinkage __visible void __init start_kernel(void)
[09:46:03] <belgin> i think you have to set the jtag up because the odds of guessing what's wrong is pretty low in my experience
[09:46:06] <clever> and head-common.S will run that function
[09:47:15] <clever> belgin: yeah, i have had pretty whacky problems in the past, like printk causing a fatal exception, because i didnt enable SMP support in the arm core
[09:47:26] <clever> but only if the kernel was also built with SMP support
[09:48:17] <a1ncz> build a stripped down kernel that works with the proprietary bootloader, corner down the issue with your bootloader, once the kernel loads on both bootloaders, you can start focusing on the kernel.

[17:32:27] <Pickchea> Hey, I just found out Manjaro ships with ONLYOFFICE by default. I have a licensing-related question someone here might be able to answer: How is ONLYOFFICE able to provide perfect compatibility with the office file formats from Microsoft (while being 100% free/libre on top of that)? Wouldn't they have to team up with Microsoft for that because the formats are proprietary?
[17:34:25] <joepublic> proprietary office formats have been extensively reverse engineered.
[17:34:54] <joepublic> I don't think "perfect compatibility" is an appropriate term.  "usually works" might be better.
[17:34:55] <yrk> Pickchea: I highly doubt that there is "perfect compatibility" of any sort. I'm unfamiliar with onlyoffice, but a quick read of the wikipedia page says that it doesn't support RTL languages, and microsoft does. so that is at least one way in which it isn't compatible
[17:34:55] *** Quits: DiffieHellman (~Username@user/curve25519chacha) (Remote host closed the connection)
[17:35:30] <yrk> Pickchea: also, you don't know that they are indeed completely free software. I certainly don't.
[17:35:34] *** Joins: DiffieHellman (~Username@user/curve25519chacha)
[17:36:28] <yrk> Pickchea: in conclusion, your presuppositions may be unsound
[17:36:56] <Pickchea> OK you're right, they don't claim 100% compatibility but they sure try to make you believe: "ONLYOFFICE was made for working with docx, xlsx and pptx, and has maximum MS Office compatibility (of all existing office suites). It means that all the objects present in ONLYOFFICE are created strictly according to MS Office format specs. So, if you look at a doc as a set of objects, ONLYOFFICEâs object models corresponds to OOXML specifications[â¦]"
[17:37:18] <Pickchea> They say "maximum MS Office compatibilty".
[17:37:50] <joepublic> even different versions of office render office documents differently.  "maximum compatibility" is not as high a bar as you might think.

[17:38:06] <Pickchea> For Reference: https://www.onlyoffice.com/en/document-editor-comparison.aspx

[17:40:47] <Pickchea> yrk, the code for their "DesktopEditor" project in their GitHub repository is licensed under "GNU Affero General Public License v3.0".
[17:41:14] <Pickchea> joepublic, OK thanks, good to know.
[17:42:06] <joepublic> They also have an "enterprise edition" that is nonfree.
[17:42:57] <yrk> Pickchea: that doesn't tell you much, unless you know that _everything_ that is included in manjaro is _only_ that project
[17:43:37] <yrk> Pickchea: which is to say, the fact that they have published some code on github doesn't mean that everything of theirs you come across is going to contain only that
[17:44:02] <yrk> Pickchea: and as joepublic states, they do in fact deal in proprietary software

[17:45:44] <joepublic> I am not saying that manjaro contains anything objectionable, only that they do not have a policy of only-free-software (upstream arch has no such policy), so manjaro might or might not include nonfree components along with GPL components.
[17:45:53] <joepublic> (in this case)
[17:46:08] <yrk> Pickchea: yes, I know that it is labeled AGPLv3, and I know that they have published some AGPLv3 code. that doesn't mean that onlyoffice, as it is in manjaro, is fully free
[17:46:46] <yrk> Pickchea: I'm not saying it isn't, but I am saying that you can't make that determination merely based on the information you've provided so far
[17:47:10] *** Joins: lethu (~lethu@user/lethu)
[17:47:13] <Pickchea> yrk, but the only way that the package contains non-free code is if the packager maliciously lies about it.
[17:47:32] <yrk> Pickchea: in any case, back to your question. they are obviously not 100% ms-word compatible (see the one example above), and there are most probably other ways as well
[17:47:39] <joepublic> well, no, there are lots of ways.  nonfree dependencies, for example.
[17:47:41] <yrk> Pickchea: no, not really
[17:49:20] <Pickchea> joepublic, oh, I didn't know that was even possible with the AGPL3, sorry.
[17:49:50] <Pickchea> So how do I ever know for sure some package provides 100% free software?
[17:49:56] <yrk> Pickchea: check it
[17:50:01] <Pickchea> yrk, how?
[17:50:03] <joepublic> again, for all I know, onlyoffice in arch is 100% free, might be, might not be.
[17:50:03] <yrk> Pickchea: we do it all the time
[17:50:25] <joepublic> But onlyoffice is not "100% compatible" with ms office because nothing is, not even different versions of ms office.
[17:50:29] <yrk> Pickchea: it is exactly like doing a security audit for a piece of software
[17:50:54] <yrk> Pickchea: the only way to see if software has bugs is to check it. proprietary parts is a type of bug. check for it

[18:25:54] <DiffieHellman> It's stored on a flash chip yes, but as the VBIOS is software and you can trivially flash a replacement, it should be treated more as software htan hardware.
[18:26:36] <joepublic> the evil, malicious vbios, if you don't muck about flashing it (and you don't need to to use the device), is hardware.  different issue.

[18:27:17] <DiffieHellman> The VBIOS is needed to init the GPU, so you can't do without it.
