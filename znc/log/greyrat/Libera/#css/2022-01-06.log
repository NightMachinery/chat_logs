[02:02:39] <hassoon> FunkyBob: javascript
[02:03:11] <FunkyBob> yeah
[02:03:17] <FunkyBob> it's in react, so t here's already that...
[02:04:10] <hassoon> you want.. to do that logic in css ? or js, i don't get it
[02:05:59] <FunkyBob> i'd perfer it in css
[02:07:36] <hassoon> FunkyBob: wait.. can you explain more
[02:07:46] <hassoon> the header cell spans rows thing
[02:08:18] <FunkyBob> so.. <thead> with two rows -- let's call them header and subheader rows
[02:08:28] <FunkyBob> first cell of header row has rowspan=2
[02:08:32] *** Joins: xse (~xse@user/xse)
[02:09:24] <FunkyBob> to affect fixed rows/cols, I need to set z-index all over  the place
[02:09:36] <hassoon> that means the first cell of header and the first cell of subheader are visually the same element ?
[02:09:39] <FunkyBob> but on t hat top/left cell it needs to be higher than all else
[02:09:45] <FunkyBob> yes
[02:10:08] <FunkyBob> so, first col of header rows needs to be marked zIndex: 4; for instance
[02:10:26] <FunkyBob> but if the header row spans, then the first cell of the subheader is visually second cell
[02:10:36] <FunkyBob> and should _not_ have zIndex: 4
[02:12:21] <hassoon> fyou want to make the spanned column (which is visually the first-row's 1st column and the second-row's 1st column combined) fixed ?
[02:12:25] <hassoon> you *
[02:25:13] <FunkyBob> no, they're already fixed
[02:25:18] <FunkyBob> the issue is zIndex
[02:26:41] <hassoon> FunkyBob: i still don't understand what issue the zIndex posing, can you possibly make a fiddle ?
[02:27:02] <hassoon> * is posing *
[02:28:31] <FunkyBob> https://dpaste.com/CVZ5FPC8H
[02:29:05] <FunkyBob> so the issue comes when the top-left cell (the one with 4) spans two header rows

[02:33:55] <hassoon> the column labelled root
[02:33:55] <FunkyBob> my issue is that the z-index 4 selector gets applied to 'Sub 1'

[02:41:12] <hassoon> what if it spans ?
[02:41:44] <hassoon> lemme span it ..
[02:41:51] <FunkyBob> ?
[02:42:02] <hassoon> 17:10 < FunkyBob> which works so long as the 'root' cell doesn't span more rows
[02:42:13] <hassoon> what if we span the root cell for more rows
[02:42:29] <FunkyBob> or what if it doesn't span all the header rows?
[02:44:56] <hassoon> FunkyBob: i still don't understand how my solution is not perfect
[02:45:28] <hassoon> you mean if the root cell is just spanning through a limited nulmber of rowns of the header and not all of them ?
[02:45:44] <hassoon> e.g if the header has 4 rows, and the root cell spanns through the first 2 rows ?
[02:46:06] <FunkyBob> yes
[02:46:55] <hassoon> FunkyBob: sure, the thead > tr:nth-child(1) > th:first-child  selector will always target the root cell
[02:47:13] <hassoon> FunkyBob: it is always in the first tr, as the first child of it
[02:47:17] <hassoon> what's wrong with that
[02:47:44] <FunkyBob> and what happens when it's t he first cell of the second row?

[02:53:16] <FunkyBob> on the <table> you can tell it the number of fixed cols ... and it takes care of that

[03:00:31] <hassoon> FunkyBob: when there is a rowspan just mark the subsequent rows initial cells in your react js code, and add the z-index to that class in css
[03:00:40] <hassoon> isn't that easily doable in the react code ?
[03:02:32] <hassoon> FunkyBob: i mean let javascript take care of marking the subsequent rows initial cells where there is a rowspan, with a classname, then style them accordingly with css
[03:02:54] <hassoon> i imagine that's easy anyway
[03:04:21] <FunkyBob> so I already have some code that iterates _all_ rows to mark their cells with a left style
[03:04:38] <FunkyBob> should be able to do a subsequent loop only over header rows to find spans
[03:04:42] <hassoon> there you go within the iteration you put your logic
[03:04:46] <hassoon> yep
[03:13:27] <FunkyBob> there was some promise in one comment about using colgroup/col...
[03:13:43] <FunkyBob> but AIUI you can't select on col/colgroup, or style that way via them
[03:13:45] <FunkyBob> more's the pity

[11:55:24] <podeni> Hi everyone. I'm attempting to use an <img tag to set the background of an element (as opposed to "background-image"). The reason is, I'm using Next.js's <Image> component which serves optimized images. I've managed, using relative and absolute positioning on the wrapper and content elements, to have it so the element has the exact image size. But I'm now trying to do something else, namely on
[11:55:24] <podeni> certain resolutions to have the element size fit the content, and only display the leftmost side of the image (maintaining height) while hiding overflow to the right. Not sure if it makes sense the way I explained it. How could I achieve this last part? Make image height stretch to element height and hide overflow to the right.

[15:21:29] <Henry151> hi
[15:21:39] <Henry151> I'm working this into a project i'm doing: https://codepen.io/nicolaspavlotsky/pen/wqGgLO
[15:21:50] <Henry151> and I am trying to figure out how to make the back side of the card have an image
[15:21:57] <Henry151> i managed to put one there but the scale is all wrong
[15:22:46] <Henry151> it looks great on the front side of the image, but when i add one to the backside, the same size image, instead of fitting perfectly in the box like it's meant to and how it does on the front, instead it only shows a small corner of the image and the rest spills out of the box

[15:37:50] <Henry151> there's an image on the front
[15:37:55] <Henry151> i added one to the back as well
[15:38:40] <hassoon> you added it wrong
[15:38:44] <hassoon> using inine style

[15:44:05] <hassoon> Henry151: use a stretched pseudo-element anyway

[23:02:59] <twiclo> https://jsfiddle.net/sebf56n8/
[23:03:00] <twiclo> I want these images to shrink to remain proportional to the display they're on. On my phone the images are the exact same size and if they were small than the overall container would shrink and I feel like it'd all be fixed. I tried max-with:100% and height: auto but all it did was make certain thumbnails more narrow on desktop
[23:10:34] *** Quits: Rockwood (~Rocky@user/rocky) (Quit: The Time is Over)
[23:15:04] <hunboy> twiclo, img is an inline element, fits to the baseline, you need add vertical align: top; to <img> perhaps
[23:15:28] <hunboy> vertical-align: top;
[23:16:09] <twiclo> So that with the max-width and auto height?
[23:16:22] <hunboy> nope
[23:16:46] <twiclo> So only vertical-align?
[23:17:59] <hunboy> just add vertical-align to see what happens
[23:24:10] *** Joins: dpuerto (~dpuerto@136-27-83-52.cab.webpass.net)
[23:24:55] <twiclo> Didn't change anything
[23:28:48] <Henry151> hassoon: no, what we did earlier looked great, but i cannot seem to figure out how to set a unique "back-of-the-card" image for each card. I can set a "all of the backs of all the cards" image up in the css, but i need a specific image on the back of each one.

[23:31:04] <Henry151> but thank you for your help you got me most of the way there
[23:31:39] <Henry151> i also am trying to figure out how to make those little pop-up-when-you-hover-on-them words be aligned horizontally, like the row below them
[23:32:12] <Henry151> also i would love to make them so they are "hover to bring up pop-up, but pop-up doesn't go away unless you hover on another one of the pop-up words"

[23:36:22] <Henry151> so it seems if you look here: https://bpa.st/N7MA at the source of https://romp.work (under construction) on line 220, if i put an image there it becomes the back-side image of all the cards
[23:37:13] <Henry151> but if i try to specify an individual card's back in a style="..." thing inside the <img> tag, i wind up with a distorted image, that's not really viewable, it's like stretched so big you can't even be sure if it is the image or not
[23:37:45] <Henry151> i also want the cards to flip over at like, half-speed, super slow-mo
[23:37:55] <Henry151> any idea if any of that is achievable?
[23:40:41] <hassoon> Henry151: yo udo that in html, as you did for front images using inline style
[23:40:49] <hassoon> Henry151: otherwise using javascript
