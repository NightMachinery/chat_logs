[01:56:26] <pulse> that makes no sense to me
[01:57:09] <pulse> choice implies the ability to generate outcomes that could not be predicted by previous events alone

[03:28:57] <pulse> your questions illustrate humanity's reach of this subject perfectly
[03:29:24] <pulse> (we have no idea what consciousness is)
[03:30:09] <ProfSimm> pulse: I just tend to recall that the mind often likes to work with "objects". Things that are distinct and unique, and that then interact. But it's mostly a convenience concept. It's not about the things interaction it's the interactions themselves.
[03:30:30] <ProfSimm> pulse: we're not water touching water, we're the swirl that forms in it
[03:30:41] <pulse> when you were a kid you didn't know how to make distinctions, but you still had a mind
[03:30:42] <ProfSimm> The water changes, the swirl stays
[03:30:51] <pulse> distinguishing is learned
[03:31:09] <pulse> ProfSimm, well, our "bodies" are
[03:31:24] <pulse> unfortunately nobody has ever been able to identify the "I" of that body, though
[03:31:43] <ProfSimm> pulse: are bodies are what
[03:31:53] <pulse> a patterning
[03:32:02] <ProfSimm> Isn't everything
[03:32:08] <pulse> kind of
[03:32:15] <pulse> even the mind is a kind of patterning
[03:32:19] <ProfSimm> Sure
[03:32:21] <pulse> but the difference is it's aware of itself
[03:32:26] <pulse> which is rather unique
[03:32:29] <ProfSimm> Well.
[03:32:49] <ProfSimm> I think it's inevitable
[03:33:00] <pulse> you think it's inevitable for patterns to become aware of themselves?
[03:33:05] <ProfSimm> Yes
[03:33:20] <ProfSimm> pulse: for most of the evolution of life on this planet, life has been single-cellular.
[03:33:30] <ProfSimm> pulse: multicellular evolved very fast.
[03:33:31] <pulse> that's kind of the premise of the whole material scientific domain, so. i can see it
[03:33:41] <ProfSimm> Human civilziation evolved even faster.
[03:33:48] <ProfSimm> And technology we make is EVER faster.
[03:33:59] <pulse> unfortunately it skips any mention of the original pattern that pushed patterning into motion

[03:48:58] <CodeAgain> ProfSimm, it's indeed true that the measurement would interact with the system and change it, but yet the fact that you decide to measure something is also the outcome of some deterministic process

[04:02:19] <CodeAgain> Well, in that we can agree, it's basic Simon's bounded rationality 
[04:02:41] <amigojapan> Decker: also tried removeChild()... and did it recursively too
[04:03:18] <CodeAgain> However, we can't just invalidate what we do actually know through millennia of accumulated and progressive knowledge 
[04:03:45] <pulse> actually we can
[04:03:48] <pulse> we just don't want to
[04:04:05] <pulse> things we "know" change all the time anyway
[04:04:06] <CodeAgain> It's a tiny fraction of reality, but it's the best we could achieve... Our role is to try, each generation, to improve a little better like we've been doing

[04:04:44] <CodeAgain> Every change we get a step closer to reality... We'll never get there, but we get as close as possible

[04:08:03] <pulse> and that's sad
[04:08:37] <pulse> on the other hand, our society depends on logical courses of action

[04:09:34] <pulse> very much so

[04:10:23] <pulse> well. no matter how much you bend logic into a pretzel, you will never understand how the universe came to be
[04:10:53] <pulse> evolution is fine but universe just exploding into existence spontaneously seems a tad more mysterious to me
[04:11:04] <pulse> thus, the answer to that has to be irrational
[04:11:05] *** Quits: trevors (~trevors@user/trevors) (Quit: trevors)
[04:11:15] <pulse> from which follows that irrational is at least one level higher than rational
[04:11:27] <amigojapan> the rational way to act is not always the best way to act, emotion is an important factor that we should nto ingnore
[04:11:27] <pulse> but quite possibly orders of levels higher
[04:11:40] <pulse> amigojapan, true, as emotion is often irrational
[04:11:44] <CodeAgain> Emotions are also a need for survival
[04:11:53] <pulse> not all of them
[04:11:54] <CodeAgain> And they are more rational than we realize 
[04:11:59] <pulse> quite a lot of emotions can work actively against survival
[04:12:10] <amigojapan> pulse: acting purely rationally will make you into a cold hearted person
[04:12:21] <pulse> yes. and acting purely emotional will turn you into ... something
[04:12:33] <pulse> a balance is needed
[04:12:39] <CodeAgain> Well, we live in a quite different environment than along our evolution, so yeah, we created an environment against our own nature
[04:12:43] <amigojapan> agreed pulse
[04:13:17] <pulse> the problem is that our culture fears irrationality on an existential level
[04:13:23] <pulse> that's why we lock up mad people
[04:13:24] <CodeAgain> Well, emotions are physiological, and the idea that we need balance them is socially constructed 
[04:13:36] <pulse> or we give them drugs so that we pacify them, so that their behavior roughly matches our norms
[04:13:42] <CodeAgain> No one is truly balanced, it's just an illusion

[11:52:17] <EdFletcher> pyzozord: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID#Characteristics> 
[11:53:07] <beaky> atomicity is the 'all or nothing' property of individual transactions they either fully complete successfuly or fail completely (rather than fail in the middle and end up in a partway state)
[11:53:12] <pyzozord> oh i heard this before
[11:54:09] *** Quits: jackson99 (~bc8147f2@cerf.good1.com) (Quit: CGI:IRC (Session timeout))
[11:54:09] <beaky> and isolation is more complex to explain (sincee there are different levels) but its like where you have more than 1 transaction but they dont interact each other in weird ways so the user can treat each transaction as if it were 'individual'
[11:54:31] <beaky> isolation is where all the concurrency sauce happens
[11:54:39] <beaky> (and also consistency)
[11:55:08] <pyzozord> those actually pretty interesting constraints
[11:55:55] <pyzozord> isolation basically means paralellism
[11:56:16] <pyzozord> basically you can do atomic operation on different parts of the database at the same time 
[11:56:26] <Gamah> did somebody say SQL?
[11:56:50] <pony> I don't think beaky's tdb is in SQL I may be mistaken
[11:56:59] <beaky> yes there are different isolation levels each designed to prevent specific anomalies like for example preventing one transaction from reading an update done in the middle of another transaction before that other transaction has committed
[11:57:29] <pony> neat
[11:57:55] <pyzozord> but fundamentally I don't think two records can be inserted at the same time
[11:57:59] <pyzozord> to the same table
[11:58:33] <pyzozord> because if there is a request at the same time to get total number of records in that table, what do you return
[11:59:06] *** Quits: NeoFAT32 (~UserNick@user/NeoFAT32) (Remote host closed the connection)
[11:59:18] <pyzozord> hmm maybe if you can return last valid total before updates began then inserts could be parallel, after all updates aren't finished yet
[12:00:19] <beaky> yes there is a isolation level for that 'serializable transactions' where you make sure the concurrent transactions are always handled as if they were always 'one after the other' (and will be rollbacked if that is not pozzible) https://cs.brown.edu/~mph/HerlihyW90/p463-herlihy.pdf

[15:47:31] <davros_> its the usual gamedev level building workflow

[16:29:55] <pyzozord> what if elements are strings
[16:30:04] <bjs> pyzozord: well if you have a set with N things in it, then there are 2^N elements in the powerset
[16:30:06] <GeDaMo> Does it use the set bits to select elements from the array?
[16:30:09] <lamein> in my problem the elements were objects
[16:30:29] <bjs> pyzozord: so you loop for 0..2^N and for each of those, the bits of the index in the powerset tells you which elements are in the powerset
[16:32:23] <bjs> like the indexes are a big boolean array telling you whether each object at that bit index is included in this subset

[21:00:32] <bnchs__> pyzozord, because curl is written in C
[21:00:38] <bnchs__> and that is written in Go
[21:01:00] <hans> bnchs__: Go isn't slow enough to explain that gap, not even close
[21:01:17] <GeDaMo> Is it faster if you use https instead?
[21:01:39] <GeDaMo> Or www.gopl.io ?
[21:02:10] <GeDaMo> Because http://gopl.io redirects twice
[21:02:10] <bayaz> Title: The Go Programming Language 
[21:02:17] <hans> pyzozord: i can speculate, Curl stops reading as soon as it hits the "Content-Length" number of bytes, a naive HTTP client may keep reading until the remote server close the tcp socket, which may be much slower, especially if the server attempt "connection: keep-alive" stuff
[21:02:36] <pyzozord> thing is, when I tested it with other arguments and it seems to behave on par with curl
[21:02:46] <pyzozord> ooh I just figured it out, i'm dumb
[21:02:55] <hans> pyzozord: that's why, for example, that libcurl was much faster than file_get_contents on http urls in php prior to 5.6
[21:02:57] <pyzozord> curl without -L doesn't follow redirects
[21:03:00] <pyzozord> that domain redirects
[21:03:12] <hans> ohh lel
[21:03:38] <pyzozord> curl -L http:// gopl.io takes the same amount of time, actually a bit more
[21:04:10] <hans> pyzozord: how about curl -L --compressed http://gopl.io
[21:04:10] <bayaz> Title: The Go Programming Language 
[21:04:11] <pyzozord> GeDaMo: yes that was it, the double redirect. Curl doesn't follow redirects without -L

[21:25:51] <Amadiro__> TonyStone, You'll probably want to look into some of the prior art in this space then. Operations/signals engineers have a lot of tech around this, like prometheus, grafana, influxdb etc. You'll want to build this as a pull-based system, not a push-based system

[21:31:39] <Amadiro__> well, depends on your time horizon
[21:31:49] <Amadiro__> if you put a 4G or 5G modem in there, you'll be fine for 10-20 years
[21:32:08] <Amadiro__> if you want more reliability and longevity than that without intervention, you might want to think about using something like APRS or other networks

[21:32:19] <GeDaMo> I believe you can special SIMs for data tracking purposes but it'll still cost

[22:46:40] <gladys> im a little confused about clang/llvm. Ive used cmake. But was under the impression I was ultimately using gcc. What is there importance in C language toolchains ? Ive literally only ever used gcc ( with make/autotools ). C is pretty much the only language I know (other than some perl). Due to the fact that is tends to be a trickier language. Im only now at the point where I know enough libraries and 
[22:46:46] <gladys> understand data types and memory well enough to even consider these things.  
[22:47:18] <gladys> Ive just compiled with make scripts, (and autotools).
[22:47:24] <gladys> which is maybe archaic
[22:48:02] <GeDaMo> clang/llvm are a completely separate implementation of C to gcc

[23:18:19] <user51> i'm happy with it, but it demonstrates a lot of limits in awk. but i'm also thinkign that making it more compact or whatever is getting into 'too smart' territory.

[23:18:45] <flakland> maybe it ignores function parameters though, i dont know why this gets through
[23:19:03] <GeDaMo> Which implicit conversion do you expect ti to complain about in this case?
[23:19:15] <user51> originally, i wanted to build the grammar bottom up: define the tokens first, then build a tree corresponding to the grammar

[23:43:50] <nomagno> I don't take back my ridicule of centralized package management culture. Sorry for the precalculus thingy tho, I did overreact
[23:44:25] <pyzozord> left pad incident and general npm situation is really poor I agree
[23:44:33] <Hash> Hey
[23:44:36] <Hash> Good afternoon

[23:44:45] *** Quits: rindolf (~shlomif@inkscape/dev/shlomif) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:44:50] <nomagno> Like, this is the kind of stuff I think preprocessor macros are for
[23:45:13] *** Joins: rindolf (~shlomif@inkscape/dev/shlomif)
[23:45:30] <nomagno> It's perfectly reasonable to have preprocessor macros to inline stuff where even a subroutine call is bloat
[23:45:47] <pyzozord> but assuming that all web developers are just code monkeys without an inch of brain or experise would be unfair
[23:46:12] <nomagno> I haven't said that
[23:46:36] <user51> nomagno: i personally use the c preprocessor to fold common pieces of code
[23:46:38] <nomagno> What was the name of this thingy? Uh, it was semily-related to the Tragedy of the Commons
[23:47:00] <nomagno> user51: Same, but I don't recommend using the C preprocessor for non-C of course
[23:47:02] <pyzozord> I know but it could have been read that way, after I said "web dev" and you said "left pad npm package land :|"
[23:47:07] <user51> my argument is "just a few less tokens to bother with".

[23:47:31] <user51> but you still need to be careful, because a year and a half later i spent 15 minutes debugging a supposedly static #define :P
[23:48:01] <nomagno> pyzozord: Well just to be clear it was in reference to how high-level it is
[23:48:04] <pyzozord> i guess sometimes it's just jokes but then sometimes it feels more mean especially when I already feel stupid anyway
[23:49:12] <nomagno> pyzozord: As a rule of thumb, as long as you keep accumulating knowledge ur gud
[23:49:46] <user51> btw pyzozord, thinking abuot all those topics made me think of breadth-first search
[23:49:51] <GeDaMo> Any day in which you learn something is a good day
[23:50:06] <pyzozord> ok me and my ego will go accumulate some knoweledge now
[23:50:08] <pyzozord> :P
[23:50:38] <pyzozord> nomagno: no hard feelings, sorry my stuff ended up on you
[23:50:40] <user51> learning is good, but seeing things from different perspectives can also be great
[23:50:47] *** Joins: _inky (~inky_@46.36.114.138)
[23:50:59] <user51> sometimes i look for code in languages i dont know just to see how it's done
[23:51:00] <GeDaMo> In learning,  you don't want depth first or breadth first search, you want something like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm
[23:51:00] <bayaz> Title: A* search algorithm - Wikipedia 
[23:51:30] <GeDaMo> http://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code
[23:52:16] <user51> GeDaMo: i was thinking of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm
[23:52:20] <user51> crap
[23:52:36] <user51> https://math.stackexchange.com/a/617995
[23:53:01] <user51> double crap, the answer does mention a*
[23:53:14] <pyzozord> GeDaMo: isn't a* kind of depth first, just with a sense of direction
[23:53:20] * user51 double bonks user51 
[23:53:43] * filename officially tapped mS
[23:54:01] <pyzozord> as far as I know a* is just dijkstra's algorithm but has heuristics for ordering the priority of the queue
[23:54:34] <GeDaMo> It's best first
[23:55:15] <pyzozord> oh no sorry I meant to say breadth not depth in my message
[23:55:27] <GeDaMo> YOu can stop going deeper if you find something more interesting
[23:56:05] <GeDaMo> Well, you can also stop going wider if going deeper is more interesting :P
[23:56:26] <user51> out-of-the-box first search :P
[23:56:39] <pyzozord> my problem is there are so many interesting things
[23:56:55] <pyzozord> and the most imporant things ar the least interesting ones like math
[23:56:58] <GeDaMo> Yeah, that's kind of my problem too :|
[23:57:01] <user51> make a list, rank each item, and quicksort :P

[23:57:57] <pyzozord> tbh if I knew what I wanted in general, that would be half the solution already
[23:58:19] <GeDaMo> Maybe you need a project
[23:58:50] <pyzozord> well anyway, atm have opportunities to learn big scale and high performance web backend development so I must focus on that
[23:58:55] <lamein> a project is always a good idea indeed
[23:59:28] *** Joins: cincoswim (~cincoswim@cm-72-241-174-56.buckeyecom.net)
[23:59:45] <pyzozord> opportunities like this don't come often, so I must make the best out of it. But on the other hand I'm not doing what is the most imporant, which atm is math
[23:59:46] <user51> pyzozord: how would you feel if you'll never be able to learn half the items on your list?
