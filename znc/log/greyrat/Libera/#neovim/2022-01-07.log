[00:03:43] <lockejan[m]> Hey there👋 I recently started seeing significantly increased start up time for sumneko lsp and found this already solved issue.🤔 https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server/issues/386
[00:03:43] <lockejan[m]> I‘m currently following master on sumneko and neovim under macOS Big Sur . 
[00:03:44] <lockejan[m]> Is anyone here facing the same issue or knows which version Tag/commit introduced the recent startup increase? (I haven’t tested against any older version tags yet.)
[00:04:17] <mjlbach[m]> Hmm still seems quick to me
[00:04:20] <mjlbach[m]> I use it via homebrew
[00:05:03] *** Joins: moxie (~moxie@user/moxie)
[00:06:16] <gegoune[m]> gpanders: Yes, that works, thanks, but I still would like to leave visual mode once my function has ran.
[00:06:53] <lockejan[m]> mjlbach[m]: Good to know. Then I probably need to work it out on my side.

[01:24:05] <buu> And then when I type, say, "foo" it hides the autocomplete menu and starts adding the "foo" after os.File

[05:08:27] <b0o> When I run format a file via vim.lsp.buf.formatting(), if I have that file open in multiple buffers, the non-focused buffers get scrolled to the top.

[06:28:51] <ahmad-reza619Ahm> hey there, im developing on a javascript project, and i wanted autocomplete using coq, nvim-lspconfig and i installed typescript-language-server but it seems it doesnt work, can anyone help me out?
[06:33:52] <ahmad-reza619Ahm> or is typescript language server is only for typescript?
[06:36:32] <reenii[m]1> ahmad-reza619Ahm: exactly that.
[06:37:10] <ahmad-reza619Ahm> is there no lsp for javascript?
[06:37:11] <reenii[m]1> you want to look for ESLint instead, if you want a regular Javascript project.
[06:37:33] <reenii[m]1> ahmad-reza619Ahm: https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md#eslint
[06:38:02] <ahmad-reza619Ahm> cause  the description on tsserver is that its lsp for typescript & javascript, so i got confused
[06:39:22] <ahmad-reza619Ahm> well i was using coc and it worked well even in js project
[06:39:53] <ahmad-reza619Ahm> i guess i'll just use old coc
[06:40:45] <mjlbach[m]> reenii[m]1: typescript-language-server works for javascript

[06:56:06] <mjlbach[m]> Ok, but that has nothing to do with setting up autocompletion

[06:59:17] <mjlbach[m]> Oh, interesting
[06:59:52] <mjlbach[m]> so `coq.lsp_ensure_capabilities {}` wraps your server config to inject capabilities for autocompletion, so I guess that is fine
[07:00:14] <mjlbach[m]> I haven't used coq, I'm sure that there is no error in the built-in client (LSP) as it works fine with nvim-cmp
[07:00:19] <ahmad-reza619Ahm> yea it supposed to show autocompletion
[07:00:22] <mjlbach[m]> and I'm sure tsserver works with javascript projects
[07:01:09] <ahmad-reza619Ahm> i'll just use coc for now and investigate this matter later

[13:35:01] <vigoux> yeah I see
[13:35:10] <vigoux> I would use a macro for that

[16:58:22] <sunjonSenghanBri> swap files became a thing in vim 3.0/1994, apparently. I doubt most plugins would fit on a floppy these days :]]

[17:46:02] <vigoux> Tiny question for the vim.keymap experts
[17:46:10] <jaawerth[m]> sunjon (Senghan Bright):  yes, that's the one! thanks, that was going to bother me
[17:46:11] <jaawerth[m]> in theory, a great tool
[17:46:32] <vigoux> I have a mapping that evaluates vim.fn.pumvisible() in a vim.keymap mapping
[17:46:56] <vigoux> And even is the pum is actually visible, vim.fn.pumvisible() actually returns 0
[17:51:24] <jaawerth[m]> vigoux: believe it or not, that's the documented behavior
[17:51:28] <jaawerth[m]> but yes, it's confusing
[17:51:42] <jaawerth[m]> oh wait no I just have bad reading comprehension
[17:51:51] <jaawerth[m]> nevermiiind
[17:51:52] <vigoux> In vim mappings it is not
