[00:00:25] <brcolow> Er, no
[00:00:28] <brcolow> sorry. 32 bits 8 times.
[00:00:58] <jarthur_> Right, so 256 bits/32 bytes

[00:01:29] <brcolow> Aye.
[00:07:43] <jarthur> brcolow one thing to be aware of is many of the Bitcoin Core implementations are specially designed to deliver a double-digested result (in case you weren't already aware)
[00:09:06] <brcolow> Yeah I noticed that.
[00:09:32] <brcolow> Quick question.. on this line https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/7fcf53f7b4524572d1d0c9a5fdc388e87eb02416/src/crypto/sha256_avx2.cpp#L63 isn't the out + 32 + offset meaning move fowards 32 + offset BYTES, not bits?
[00:09:55] <brcolow> In which case out would be 256 bytes....not bits

[00:15:10] <brcolow> Which leads me back to my original issuse -- we end up with 256 bytes doing the 8way transform (32 bytes * 8) - then need to go "back" to 32 bytes for the final hash
[00:15:22] <brcolow> It must use some type of interleave or something...like select every N bytes
[00:17:43] <brcolow> I think I need to study https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwi9zqeOjLvxAhXB3J4KHY93CtUQFjAAegQIChAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.intel.com%2Fcontent%2Fdam%2Fwww%2Fpublic%2Fus%2Fen%2Fdocuments%2Fwhite-papers%2Fcommunications-ia-multi-buffer-paper.pdf&usg=AOvVaw3buUrNoiKmVEDh2qyEpgSG

[00:18:03] <brcolow> https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/communications-ia-multi-buffer-paper.pdf
[00:21:14] <MacGyver> That does look rather odd, yes, but it looks like it's computing 8 hashes vectorized.
[00:21:49] <MacGyver> The result after those 8 calls to Write8 is 8 hashes back-to-back in out.
[00:22:27] <brcolow> Oh...right.....
[00:22:31] <MacGyver> Which is a pretty common technique to apply vectorization.
[00:22:50] <MacGyver> Can't vectorize the internals? Just process multiple inputs side-by-side.

[10:25:07] *** Quits: Deknos (~someone@user/menace) (Quit: Deknos)
[10:25:10] <soulisson> Apologies for this question. I think I don't understand what's a key stream. My english isn't great but I read some articles. My understanding of a key stream is that it's a collection of bytes generateed one after the other in time.
[10:32:14] <riv> so in general a key is secret data
[10:32:34] <riv> a key stream could be part of a stream cipher that needs to be kept secret
[10:33:05] <soulisson> riv, yes, sorry I forgot to mention it was in the context of stream ciphers
[10:33:05] <riv> so you set up your stream cipher with a short key, and it produces an extremely long key stream that is (for example) xor'd against data to encrypt it
[10:36:14] <soulisson> riv, I think I understand of how it's used what I'm not sure of is the definition of a key stream. I understand it as a collection of bytes pseudo-randomly generated bytes one after another in time.
[10:36:43] <wasamasa> you're a learning by the book person, eh
[10:36:57] <wasamasa> the definition can be as misleading as possible, as long as it's from a book, it's fine
[10:37:29] <soulisson> wasamasa, yes. Although I also tried to implement RC4 in python to get a better understanding.
[10:37:47] <wasamasa> a key is a secret crypto parameter
[10:38:04] <wasamasa> fixed number of bytes
[10:38:32] <wasamasa> so far so good?
[10:38:42] <soulisson> yes, sure
[10:40:07] <wasamasa> now, in a stream cipher, a key stream is derived from the crypto parameters
[10:40:11] <wasamasa> it's as many bytes as you need
[10:40:36] <wasamasa> combine with plaintext and you get ciphertext
[10:40:42] <wasamasa> combine with ciphertext and you get plaintext
[10:44:07] <soulisson> wasamasa, ok. Apologies for those stupid questions. In what regards, the description I gave is incorrect? I fail to see it :(
[10:44:16] <wasamasa> it is too generic
[10:44:25] <wasamasa> the output of /dev/urandom would fit your definition
[10:44:30] <wasamasa> but it's not a keystream
[10:44:32] *** Joins: Guyver2 (Guyver@guyver2.xs4all.nl)
[10:44:45] <wasamasa> use that for encryption and you can never decrypt something again, lol
[10:47:10] <soulisson> wasamasa, ok, so the missing part in my description is that those bytes are computed from a key? Is the part about being generated "one after another in time" correct?
[10:47:30] <wasamasa> that is too specific
[10:47:49] <wasamasa> AES-CTR turns a block cipher into a stream cipher, one block at a time
[10:50:44] <soulisson> wasamasa, ok, so we could describe the key stream as an n-uple (K0, K1, ...., Kn) where Kn and Kn+1 are generated one after the other and the size depends on the algorithm (it could one byte like RC4 or 128 bits for AES) for instance?
[10:51:19] <wasamasa> you could do that, but it would miss the point
[10:52:36] <soulisson> wasamasa, really sorry. What exactly would miss the point?
[10:52:49] <wasamasa> your suggestion
[10:53:26] <wasamasa> it's a lot more words that don't give you exactly more understanding about the nature of the keystream
[10:55:13] <soulisson> oh ok, I just wanted to emphasize in the last sentence that how the elements of the keystream are generated depends on the algorithm and it might vary in size: RC4 vs AES-CTR. I'm not good at all in explaining my self, even less in english, lol, really sorry

[11:01:49] <soulisson> wasamasa, thanks a lot for your help. Sorry about those stupid questions. I'm not bright at all. 
[11:02:17] <wasamasa> the idea is that you can recreate the keystream again with the correct parameters
[11:02:23] <wasamasa> that's why it's described as pseudo-random
[11:02:42] <wasamasa> it looks random and unpredictable, but it's generated from a few numbers
[11:03:19] <wasamasa> it's not actual randomness
[11:03:29] <wasamasa> like when netflix is deriving randomness from lava lamps
[11:03:35] <wasamasa> you cannot reseed lava lamps, lol
[11:05:27] <soulisson> yes, I understood that part. The algorithm is really a Pseudo Random Generator

[11:20:52] <soulisson> I have another stupid question why PRNG are called number generators? If some algorithm outputs data which do not represent a random number but rather a random string of bytes, doesn't that make it a PRNG as well
[11:21:02] <soulisson> ?
[11:21:57] <yawkat> bytes are also numbers.
[11:22:04] <wasamasa> yeah, small numbers
[11:22:19] <yawkat> large numbers. small numbers are only below 2!
[11:25:01] <soulisson> So a 16 bytes output would be onsidered as a 16 bytes number :) ?
[11:25:33] <wasamasa> it can also be considered 16 byte-sized numbers
[11:28:54] <soulisson> ok, so anything that outputs "random" data based on a seed can be called a PRNG as long it verifies the properties

[11:32:20] <Haohmaru> speaking of which, shouldn't a crypto-grade PRNG produce "uniform" distribution?
[11:32:45] <riv> yes it should be indistinguishable from random
[11:34:02] <Haohmaru> so then i guess careful not to reinterpret the numbers as floating point or something similar
[11:34:13] <wasamasa> why?
[11:34:23] <wasamasa> random output is random output

[19:21:03] <soulisson> Hello again. Sorry to bother one more time. I'm trying to explain in a simple way the concept of electronic signature. Would be incorrect to define a signature as a proof of identity and integrity? For identity, it's a proof for the receiver that the signature comes from the entity it's supposed to come from. For integrity, it's a proof for the receiver that the data they have are the ones that the signing entity agreed to sign.

[19:31:21] <onelegend> do quantum key distributions need to be signed?
[19:31:27] <danieldg> a signature is proof the person possessing the private key signed the document.  The public key might also be signed by a statement (certificate) saying something about the sender's identity.
[19:31:40] <MacGyver> I.e. "somebody in control of the private key must have made this signature", and any guarantees that follow from that are guarantees built *on top* of the basic signature building block
[19:31:54] <MacGyver> It doesn't follow from the signature itself.
[19:34:16] <soulisson> Ok, damn, I thought I was close. I'm trying to explain to some folks how electronic signature is superior to regular signatures (like a bank check, ...)
[19:35:45] <danieldg> if the user registers their public key with their bank, then that's the hard half taken care of.  The nice part about cryptographic signatures is you can't forge them.
[19:36:01] <danieldg> (you can steal the key, though)
[19:36:28] <MacGyver> In that case, all you have to do is add one statement about how the identity verification is built: rather than the bank having a written signature for your account on file to which to compare every other signature you ever make (which will never be exactly the same), they have a public key for your account on file which is *at least* as good as the written signature for identity verification
[19:36:30] <MacGyver> purposes.
[19:37:46] <MacGyver> The assumption being that the key isn't stolen -- but then the assumption with written signatures is also that they're not forged.
[19:38:09] <Alipha> you may also have to deal with being able to revoke a public key in case it's stolen and/or have expiration dates associated with the public key
[19:38:11] <MacGyver> Now it's of course a very bad idea to allow regulation to assume that keys *cannot* be stolen and therefore all fraud is now the customer's fault.
[19:38:33] <MacGyver> But it's definitely easy to argue that digital signatures are *better* than handwritten signatures.
[19:38:40] <yawkat> onelegend: sure
[19:39:06] <soulisson> danieldg, no, I meant in my country, electronic signature is not really used for business purposes (unfortunately). I'm trying to advocate people for it. I thought that my definition without being perfect was technically ok.

[19:44:23] <onelegend> I have a completely opposite case to signature forgery. There are special pens, where the ink disappears after a certain amount of time. This means someone could sign a legal document with this pen, but later realize that the document does not contain the signature at all.

[20:12:51] <ms7821> the magic of a signature is that it has a public key that anyone else can use to validate it
[20:13:10] <ms7821> so if your JWTs need to be authenticated by a third party, you need signatures, but not if you're checking the JWT yourself
[20:14:06] <soulisson> ms7821, yes, indeed :)
[20:14:33] <Alipha> an HMAC is generally sufficient for JWT because the server issuing is the server that's verifying, yes

[20:15:06] <Alipha> it's an authentication code
[20:16:08] <Alipha> if you're talking to non-technical people, you could say "it's like a signature but for symmetric encryption" i guess 
[20:17:04] <Alipha> but in the cryptography world, a "signature" is specifically a term for asymmetric crypto

[20:17:19] <soulisson> Alipha, I understand. The reason I asked is because I saw it called that way on several web sites related to JWT including this one: https://jwt.io/introduction
[20:17:36] <Alipha> unfortunately, yes
[20:17:49] <soulisson> it made a little bit unconfortable, I'm not going to lie
[20:17:51] <soulisson> lol
[20:18:20] <ms7821> yeah, I think they're using signing as an umbrella term which is a bit ugh but
[20:18:36] <MacGyver> It *is* the closest to a real-world signature though.
[20:18:40] <MacGyver> As in.
[20:18:51] <ms7821> yeah
[20:18:55] <MacGyver> A real-world signature has the same symmetry.
[20:19:08] <MacGyver> Maybe I should call that analog rather than real-world.
[20:19:10] <soulisson> They also have real signatures for JWT (public/private keys, ....)
[20:19:25] <ms7821> this is why I focus on "it's a message to myself" because people understand that I can validate it but not that anyone else would believe me

[20:19:51] <ms7821> and that I can forget that I even created the message and have someone untrusted give it to me later and I'll still recognise it as mine
[20:19:59] <soulisson> so for me, it's a little bit unfortunate wording. IMO, they could have found a better wording.
[20:21:30] <MacGyver> soulisson: It's fine to say they're wrong.
[20:21:42] <MacGyver> soulisson: We tend to have and voice strong opinions in here ;)

[20:23:41] <soulisson> lol, we all have our "qualities". Mine is obsessive disorder with terminology. It's fine for studying some topics but not IT.
