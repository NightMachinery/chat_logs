[02:57:55] <jessedesu2> The shop called, my cbr parts came in
[02:57:58] <rando25892> a 2017 laptop would runa lithuim battery too so those are suppose to run strong maybe switch models if you dont feel like dedicating to the laptop further
[02:58:44] <ButterNoodle> yea a used business laptop is guaranteed to have a warn out battery.. I always budget for max ram and a new battery when I get one

[03:11:16] <omero> its a combination of using a vac cleaner and a compressor
[03:12:05] <omero> you want a vac cleaner with some kind of funnel at the end of the tube, while the compressor is blown directly on fans and stuff

[06:13:40] <MootPoot> how do you do it

[06:14:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That's kinda why taking a break sometimes helps.
[06:14:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Well, I say that but it is a thing... when you get in teh zone. But that mostly happens for personal projects in my case.

[06:17:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Oh my, yeah, no.
[06:17:34] <MootPoot> I have figured out though that I may be reverse retarded

[07:19:36] <MootPoot> its meh
[07:19:57] <ButterNoodle> is it shit
[07:19:58] <amigojapan> I see MootPoot 
[07:20:02] <MootPoot> main issue is 4gb of ram is not nearly enough to run windows, and no known way to put linux on it
[07:20:12] <MootPoot> there is a 8gb model..somewhere
[07:20:21] <MootPoot> no idea why samsung released the 4
[07:20:33] <MootPoot> it can watch a youtube vid and open VScode and thats it
[07:20:40] <ButterNoodle> 4gb was ok.. 8 years ago
[07:20:40] <MootPoot> anything more and it'll die
[07:21:05] <rando25892> it doesnt have an extraordinary gpu so 4 gigs is the range
[07:21:08] <MootPoot> there is supposed to be a 8gb version with a LTE modem as well
[07:21:24] <MootPoot> rando25892: wat
[07:21:25] <ButterNoodle> bbl
[07:21:38] <ButterNoodle> worked lay.. doing everything late..
[07:21:51] *** Joins: treeman5 (~treeman5@user/treeman5)
[07:21:54] <rando25892> i use 8-10 gigs for accelerate graphics and i would think you actually know what you are doing if you expect over 4 gigs in arm power laptop
[07:21:56] <MootPoot> if they even added like maybe 6 and 8 gb or 6 and 12 models that would be good enough
[07:22:34] <MootPoot> rando25892:  problem is even basic users will hit the 4gb mark
[07:22:46] <MootPoot> if this was running factory linux it woul be okay
[07:23:01] <amigojapan> Roey: I made sure to take a day off today because on the first shot I had a hard time on the second day
[07:23:07] <MootPoot> but what this is ; is a chromebook running win10
[07:23:12] <rando25892> well if this isnt about enlighten ment then very well you have your strategies at using machines
[07:23:13] <MootPoot> with chromebook specs
[07:23:30] <rando25892> lowers the price of the device if less people want them
[07:23:39] <MootPoot> its already like 350 USD
[07:23:42] <MootPoot> MSRP
[07:23:49] <MootPoot> could have made it 400 and usable
[07:24:13] <MootPoot> but basically at this class you would be better off with a tablet and external KB+M 
[07:24:31] <MootPoot> preferably a samsung tablet with DeX support
[07:25:08] <rando25892> yea but im not going to try and understand your perspective cause that laptop once a distro is install it will work running with four gigs
[07:25:24] <MootPoot> you cant install a distro on it
[07:25:27] <MootPoot> thats the problem
[07:25:30] <MootPoot> locked bootloader
[07:25:39] <rando25892> which one?
[07:25:46] <MootPoot> galaxy book go
[07:27:40] <rando25892> its qualcomm anyway
[07:27:51] <rando25892> so you are looking at the wrong arm devices at the time
[07:28:06] <MootPoot> there are only two laptops that support windows on arm
[07:28:12] <MootPoot> both are qualcomm
[07:31:13] <rando25892> no i ve never run windows on arm or plan to
[07:31:57] <MootPoot> I'm both confused on what you're trying to say, and what your point is
[07:32:27] <MootPoot> I'f you're not going to understand my perspective or plan to try windows on arm, then why say anything lol
[07:32:49] <rando25892> cause im on the other side
[07:33:19] <rando25892> its more difficult for windows cause its sealed its not easy for beginners for linux but its possible
[07:33:51] <MootPoot> are you mixfix
[07:34:02] <rando25892> its my alias
[07:34:06] <MootPoot> ah
[07:34:11] <MootPoot> yeah that makes sense
[07:34:15] <rando25892> tho
[07:34:17] <MootPoot> I have no idea what you're trying to say as always
[07:34:26] <rando25892> as always
[07:34:35] <rando25892> the last line covers that point tho
[07:34:45] <MootPoot> amigojapan: I'd buy it again if they gave it factory 8gb ram and unlocked the bootloader to install linux 
[07:35:02] <rando25892> though throw it all away isnt pressuring me
[07:35:07] <MootPoot> but as it is, its a no from me, I can do more with an android tablet with a keyboard and mouse
[07:35:27] <amigojapan> I see yeah MootPoot 
[07:35:53] <MootPoot> my android tablet runs debain faster then this thing lol
[07:35:56] <MootPoot> and can do more with less
[07:37:01] <MootPoot> surprisingly there are a decent amount of apps compiled for ARM64 on windows though amigojapan 
[07:37:12] <MootPoot> chromium , vscode, edge, VLC
[07:37:35] <rando25892> the more you are confuse by me its fine but ill elbow you to say that more time will pass before you realize what im (conversing) with you about
[07:38:20] <amigojapan> MootPoot: probably much more in Linux
[07:38:42] <MootPoot> afaik the only ARM linux laptop/computer is just the pinebook right?
[07:38:45] <MootPoot> and chromebooks running linux
[07:39:07] <MootPoot> I haven't checked all the apps, just the basic ones I'm likely to use on a light laptop like this

[08:12:53] <Fenderbassist> wary of*
[08:13:06] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: they are already taking about giving a third shot as a booster shot later
[08:13:27] <Nanobot> I never had any noticeable effects from either dose of Pfizer, aside from the slight weakness in the arm (which only lasted a few hours)
[08:13:44] <Fenderbassist> that is good to hear Nanobot 
[08:14:06] <Nanobot> I don't know if it's good or bad. I thought the immune reaction was supposed to be how you know it's working.
[08:14:19] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: in Japan they made an insurance of 40mil yen plus funeral costs for the family of anyone who dies of the vaccine
[08:15:02] <Fenderbassist> that is interesting, there was enough of a concern about it failing that a government actually put aside money for victims
[08:15:13] <Fenderbassist> I wonder if there is a precedent for that

[08:22:03] <Fenderbassist> I was looking for a copy of the video
[08:22:07] <Fenderbassist> not that specific website
[08:22:11] <amigojapan> Ok
[08:22:14] <Fenderbassist> just happens it was the first search result
[08:22:25] <Fenderbassist> that site might be wonky
[08:22:27] <amigojapan> Alright
[08:22:53] <Fenderbassist> but the testimony of a highly peer reviewed group of doctors was worth the watch
[08:23:00] <Nanobot> Fenderbassist: It sounds to me like the whole hydroxychloroquine thing again. Researchers were saying that the evidence doesn't seem to be there, but people kept promoting it. In the end, it didn't really work.
[08:23:29] <Fenderbassist> I don't know, a lot of doctors claimed they had success with it until governors prevented them from prescribing further
[08:23:42] <Fenderbassist> I don't think "it really didn't work" is a fully accurate statement
[08:23:54] <Nanobot> Fenderbassist: At least according to https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34318930/ , there doesn't seem to be much evidence supporting ivermectin at this time.
[08:23:55] <ImoutoBot> [title] Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19
[08:24:05] <Fenderbassist> right
[08:24:27] <Fenderbassist> because the doctors giving testimony before the senate were demanding that their findings be reviewed
[08:24:31] <Fenderbassist> this is the controversy
[08:24:44] <Nanobot> Meanwhile, the covid vaccines in use are among the most effective vaccines ever developed, with a ton of evidence behind them.
[08:24:45] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: I think Japan is working on a real treatment medicine now so I heard
[08:24:50] <Fenderbassist> I hope so
[08:25:16] <Fenderbassist> I think it remains to be seen
[08:25:32] <Fenderbassist> I refrain from hasty generalizations especially not having medical credentials
[08:25:43] <Fenderbassist> we each have to find our own way through our health care systems, this is the way I chose
[08:26:47] <rando25892> true but its not just some exterior part like our skin this thing attacks our insides its much too much
[08:26:57] <Fenderbassist> yes it's a horrible disease
[08:27:07] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: the way we choose can affect others so I don't think this should be a purely personal choice
[08:27:14] <Fenderbassist> all those lost, all those left behind
[08:27:26] <Fenderbassist> having to cope

[08:29:00] <Fenderbassist> that's probably the best link I can find
[08:29:00] <isekaijin> Those who have the luck to be able to stay at home should absolutely stay at home.
[08:29:03] <Fenderbassist> anyway, enough of that
[08:29:07] <Nanobot> My thumb just started spasming a few minutes ago. I am unhappy with this development.
[08:29:13] <Fenderbassist> I really didn't come for a debate, I came to say hello :)
[08:29:26] <Fenderbassist> Nanobot: hmmm sorry to hear that, do electrolytes help with that?
[08:29:27] <isekaijin> Nanobot: Ouch.
[08:29:33] <isekaijin> Nanobot: Related to the vaccine?
[08:29:39] <Fenderbassist> I personally have a lot of muscle spasms that I treat with minerals and herbs
[08:29:40] <amigojapan> Nanobot: didn't you recently have eye twitch?
[08:29:53] <Fenderbassist> I hope that clears up
[08:30:02] <Nanobot> I've been under a lot of stress lately. Stress can easily cause muscle spasms.
[08:30:07] <Fenderbassist> sure
[08:30:20] <amigojapan> Ouch Nanobot 
[08:30:34] <Fenderbassist> I usually eat extra potassium-rich food sources when I get really bad
[08:30:45] <isekaijin> Nanobot: Hope things get better soon.
[08:30:51] <Fenderbassist> ^
[08:31:46] <Nanobot> Fenderbassist: Isn't the potassium/spasm link basically a myth?
[08:32:41] <Fenderbassist> I don't know, my doctors tell me to do this....calcium, magnesium, potassium, selenium, manganese, etc. etc.
[08:32:59] <isekaijin> Selenium is the weird one in that bunch.
[08:33:13] <Fenderbassist> electrolyte
[08:33:14] <isekaijin> Actually, managenese too, a bit.
[08:33:20] <isekaijin> manganese*
[08:33:27] <Fenderbassist> well I seem to do well with their advice
[08:33:38] <Fenderbassist> so I think I will continue for now
[08:33:51] <isekaijin> If it works for you, then that's good.
[08:34:04] <Fenderbassist> yeah I don't do well with pharmaceuticals, usually
[08:34:10] <Fenderbassist> too many side effects
[08:34:17] <Fenderbassist> I do well with more natural remedies
[08:34:22] <Fenderbassist> for the day to day stuff
[08:34:54] <Fenderbassist> Ivermectin is the only prescription I have 
[08:34:55] <Nanobot> My treatment for spasms has always been to wait for them to go away. They always do, eventually.
[08:35:22] <Fenderbassist> I drink a good deal of water and the supplements
[08:35:36] <Fenderbassist> turmeric has helped noticeably with the pain
[08:35:36] <Nanobot> But I'm pretty sure my spasms are most often due to stress or lack of sleep.
[08:35:49] <Fenderbassist> it's quite reasonable
[08:36:00] <Nanobot> During stressful periods like this, I always get all sorts of issues with my body.
[08:36:04] <Fenderbassist> stress is a killer
[08:36:17] <Fenderbassist> I avoid stress as much as possible for the same resason
[08:36:24] <rando25892> yea thats common during work routine schedule for mine too
[08:36:56] <rando25892> i wish i was ocd with diet meals and initiating a healthy meal plan but life didnt go that way
[08:37:10] <rando25892> which is ok too cause i eat everyday

[08:38:13] <Fenderbassist> I think sometimes life is more about us fixing ourselves more than having the perfect track record
[08:38:21] <amigojapan> I'm going to 711 with my phone
[08:38:34] <Fenderbassist> what is 711 amigojapan ?
[08:38:39] <Nanobot> At work, I spent a few months developing an integration with a horrible third party product. I told my boss from the beginning that this product was shoddy and didn't look like it was going to deliver on what we were hoping to get from it. He had me continue anyway. Recently, we finally put it to the test. I tried with all my might to get it to work. But, at a meeting we had yesterday, we basically all concluded that this product wasn't going to be useful 
[08:38:40] <Nanobot> to us. Now, I'll be tasked with essentially writing our own version of that product from scratch, which is going to be a big headache as well.

[18:19:49] <amigojapan> MootPoot: my AC has a timer for that
[18:19:59] <MootPoot> timers dont respond to changing temperatures
[18:20:05] <MootPoot> my AC has a timer too
[18:20:16] <MootPoot> all it does is turn off after 8 hours or 12
[18:20:21] <Sadale> MootPoot, oh actually there's some prototype units. Maybe I could actually give one of these units to you. 
[18:20:30] <amigojapan> MootPoot: you are just too lazy
[18:20:31] <MootPoot> what does your IoT clock do
[18:20:40] <Sadale> MootPoot, If I decide to give that to you, you'd still have to pay for the shipping fee tho.
[18:21:05] <MootPoot> amigojapan: :P true, but at the same time, I dont think wanting to sleep a full night and not be woken up by heat / humidity is being lazy
[18:21:10] <MootPoot> in this particlar case
[18:21:29] <amigojapan> Ok MootPoot 
[18:21:43] <Sadale> MootPoot, It's a simple one. It just has four digits on it. It synchronize the time via internet. And it's highly configurable that you can set custom alarm tone (like composing your own), put custom message onto it, etc. :3
[18:21:57] <MootPoot> as I understand it, the biggest issue everyone has with IoT devices is security and updates right?
[18:22:02] <MootPoot> otherwise they are okay
[18:22:14] <Sadale> MootPoot, and the most important, I don't track users. There's no telemetry sent from the IoT clock to any of my servers. In fact, the clock only requires connection to NTP server over WiFi. That's it.
[18:22:37] <MootPoot> if you isolate that to just a smart IR blaster that controls dumb devices in a "smart" way, effectively that fixes the issue right
[18:22:38] <Sadale> yep. It can be difficult to make security update to IoT devices.
[18:22:51] <MootPoot> so you only have to care about a single device
[18:23:22] <MootPoot> and its simple enough that you could feasibly make your own or open source it
[18:23:37] <MootPoot> and you only need to pay for dumb IR appliance prices as well
[18:23:40] <MootPoot> win win win as I see it

[18:24:33] <MootPoot> seems like they are pretty cheap tbh

[18:24:49] <MootPoot> I've seen smart appliance tax be for more for that
[18:24:50] <MootPoot> lol
[18:25:01] <Sadale> That's not surprising with those cheap wireless microcontrollers.
[18:25:09] <Sadale> ESP8266 especially.
[18:25:19] <Sadale> I'm using it on my IoT clock as well.
[18:25:30] <MootPoot> the commerical ones can have multple IR units as well
[18:25:35] <MootPoot> at 20-30 per unit its pretty cheap
[18:28:18] <Sadale> I see :3
[18:29:26] <Sadale> Makes me wonder if they're using hardware IR peripheral or a bit-bangged one.
[18:29:37] <MootPoot> wym
[18:29:52] <MootPoot> they have hardware IR recivers and transmitters on the unit
[18:30:16] <MootPoot> what you do is register every command manually by pointing your dumb IR appliance remote at it and pressing the appropreate button
[18:30:22] <Sadale> I suspect that it's the latter because I haven't seen a microcontroller that has multiple IR peripheral so far.
[18:30:36] <MootPoot> it recives, stores and logs that as a command to transmit later
[18:30:45] <Sadale> MootPoot, oh it's a bit technical. I'm talking about how the microcontroller inside the WiFi IR remote works.
[18:30:46] <MootPoot> Sadale: no microcontroller comes with a built in IR periphral
[18:30:55] <Sadale> MootPoot, yes there are.
[18:31:00] <MootPoot> link
[18:31:41] <Sadale> MootPoot, here's an exmaple of the kind of microcontroller that supports emitting IR signal. https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/peripherals/rmt.html
[18:31:42] <ImoutoBot> [title] RMT - ESP32 - ‚Äî ESP-IDF Programming Guide latest documentation
[18:31:43] <MootPoot> "built in" as in on the same board, on "built in" as it literally is built into the microcontroller as a core function on the brainbox itself
[18:31:44] <Sadale> ESP32.
[18:31:58] <Sadale> Oh of course you'd still need to program that.
[18:32:06] <Sadale> like writing code for that on your own
[18:32:19] <MootPoot> oh
[18:32:23] <MootPoot> so its just a library
[18:32:37] <Sadale> yep. I think I've seen some STM32 modules has IR support as well.
[18:32:49] <MootPoot> yeah thats what I was thinking
[18:32:55] <MootPoot> its just software stuck on there by you
[18:32:56] <Sadale> Anyway if there's no support, I suppose that you could still bit-bang it. So that'd be a software-only implementation.
[18:33:02] <MootPoot> its not actually built in as a hardware feature
[18:33:10] <MootPoot> stop saying bit-bang
[18:33:13] <MootPoot> is a ecchi word
[18:33:16] <Sadale> lol
[18:33:36] <Sadale> oh it is a hardware feature because if the hardware "supports" it, there'd be less code required on the software side.
[18:34:03] <MootPoot> if the hardware supported it there would be a full LED driver and stuff on the microcontroller as well
[18:34:09] <MootPoot> in my mindd
[18:34:21] <Sadale> Let's see how I should put it.
[18:34:36] <MootPoot> "there is a premade library in the SDK for you to use to drive IR leds"
[18:34:40] <MootPoot> is what I would say
[18:34:51] <Sadale> uhm.
[18:35:10] <MootPoot> hmm
[18:35:27] <MootPoot> is there a good way to pair linux/android systems and microcontrollers
[18:35:34] <Sadale> So, let me put it this way. There're two kind of library. One is that it uses solely software for implementing that feature. Another is hardware-accelerated.
[18:35:46] <MootPoot> yes
[18:35:51] <Sadale> By saying the hardware support that, it'd mean that it's hardware-accelerated.
[18:35:59] <Sadale> So the software could do less.
[18:36:09] <MootPoot> is there a hardware LED driver or something in the esp32?
[18:36:16] <Sadale> For pairing linux/android with microcontroller, most often you'd use UART.
[18:36:16] <amigojapan> MootPoot: with the library, you can just hook up an IR led to the gpio
[18:36:27] <amigojapan> And program it
[18:36:27] <Sadale> MootPoot, What kind of LED tho?
[18:36:53] <MootPoot> Sadale:  if it had a LED driver it should theoretially be able to drive any LED...provided it didnt hit power limits
[18:36:59] <Sadale> oh. nope
[18:37:06] <Sadale> hold on.
[18:37:23] <MootPoot> amigojapan:  yeah but android phones dont have GPIO
[18:37:31] <MootPoot> I have a bunch of android phones that I'm trying to repurpose
[18:37:53] <amigojapan> MootPoot: why do Android phones come into the conversation?
[18:37:54] <Sadale> Any LED - nope because, as you said, power limit. Most LEDs - yes because you just need any GPIO to drive an LED. If you want to set the brightness, you can use PWM by using a timer
[18:38:16] <amigojapan> MootPoot: just use a micro controller
[18:38:31] <amigojapan> MootPoot: they are cheap
[18:38:38] <Sadale> If your Android phone supports OTG you could attach a USB to UART adapter to the USB OTG port of Android and it could communicate with the microcontroller.
[18:38:56] <MootPoot> because, as I said
[18:39:01] <MootPoot> I have a bunch of them I'm not using
[18:39:05] <MootPoot> thats the entire point

[18:40:06] <amigojapan> MootPoot: just use the right tool for the task
[18:40:08] <Sadale> MootPoot, oh. I think amigojapan mean that there's no need to use Android when you're using a microcontroller. Adding Android to it makes the setup more complicated
[18:40:25] <amigojapan> Yup
[18:40:26] <Sadale> MootPoot, he didn't mean that you're complicating thing by purchasing too many android phones
[18:40:43] <amigojapan> That is what I meant
[18:40:44] <MootPoot> they're just old phones that people have given to me after they dont use em
[18:40:46] <MootPoot> anymore
[18:40:48] <Sadale> Anyway tho it really depends on your use case. I've seen system using Android plus microcontroller :P
[18:41:04] <MootPoot> the big reason why I wanted to try the android is because it already has wifi
[18:41:12] <MootPoot> and a battery
[18:41:25] <Sadale> MootPoot, some microcontroller modules do have wifi as well. No battery tho.
[18:41:33] <MootPoot> hmm
[18:41:44] <Sadale> MootPoot, consider donating them to deltachat if you've got many unused Android phone. They want them for testing their app.
[18:41:47] <MootPoot> cheapest I can find is like 30-40 dollars for a raspi zero I guess
[18:41:48] <Sadale> And it's an FOSS project.
[18:44:31] <MootPoot> but tbh there SHOULD be a way to somehow link up android to some sort of microcontroller
[18:44:48] <MootPoot> where the android does all the number crunching and data handling and relies on the GPIO of the controller
[18:45:04] <MootPoot> I faintly remember something like that in hackaday
[18:45:12] <MootPoot> people linking up raspberry pis and arduions
[18:46:02] <MootPoot> there would be so many uses for it
[18:46:04] <MootPoot> think about it
[18:46:06] <amigojapan> MootPoot: why not let the microcontroller do the computing?
[18:46:22] <MootPoot> lots of reasons
[18:46:59] <Sadale> microcontrollers are weaker than Android processor.
[18:47:08] <Sadale> like far weaker. It depends on the computation that you want to do
[18:47:13] <amigojapan> MootPoot: microcontrollers are way easier to program than Android phones
[18:47:24] <Sadale> For intense computation you really don't want to use a weak microcontroller.
[18:47:30] <MootPoot> 1.) too slow, not enough power 2.) dosen't support more advanced libraries like if you want to do stuff with AI or ML 3.) its more expensive to get GPS, BT and wifi plus a display and camera on a microcontroller then a cheap android phone 4.) comes with battery 5.) LTE modem as well

[18:52:45] <MootPoot> but that would be hundreds on conditions
[18:52:49] <MootPoot> of
[18:53:11] <MootPoot> once you start taking into account stuff like wildfire smoke, seasonal weather patterns etc
[18:53:11] <amigojapan> Nah
[18:53:49] <amigojapan> MootPoot: all you need is the conditions you usually think about
[18:54:09] <amigojapan> Humidity heat and time
[18:55:36] <MootPoot> humidity, heat, time , air quality, forecasts from outside, electricity prices for the month, and my own sleep scedule

[19:03:23] <isekaijin> :)
[19:03:55] <isekaijin> God-fucking-dammit.
[19:04:19] <isekaijin> There is this grad student who wants to organize a seminar. And here I am like ‚ÄúI am on fucking vacations. I do not want to think about work until the next semester starts.‚Äù
[19:06:35] <Sadale> isekaijin, lol tell the grad student about that :D
[19:07:05] <Sadale> isekaijin, "Awww please gimme a break. It's a vacation time. :3"
[19:10:46] <isekaijin> He set up a WhatsApp group and added us all. He organized two meetings already. And I wish I had not missed the first one, because they made so many fucking stupid decisions and sealed them in stone.

[19:11:57] <isekaijin> I was too busy playing Arknights, though. And I do not regret that part.
[19:11:59] <Sadale> isekaijin, how does it work? How come a grad student's able to singlehandedly organize a seminar?
[19:12:10] <isekaijin> He can't, of course.
[19:12:13] <isekaijin> He just thinks he can.
[19:12:14] <Sadale> isekaijin, and who're "they"? the people that the grad student added./

[19:12:32] <Sadale> Simple. Just don't join his seminar :P
[19:12:38] <Sadale> You haven't agreed to join at all
[19:12:45] <isekaijin> The problem is that these people are science students who do not know the slightest thing about engineering or marketing.
[19:13:18] <isekaijin> They just think ‚ÄúI want to do X, Y, Z‚Äù, but they have no fucking idea how much it is going to cost.

[19:17:51] <Sadale> MootPoot, lol please try contacting them while they're at work hours, really. They need to rest xD
[19:18:02] <zaitcev> treeman5: the train thing was okay, pretty decent for the characters.
[19:18:02] <MootPoot> I was like "ok" and then I finished my work at 7pm and then contacted them for more

[19:18:25] <MootPoot> even better they are in a differnet time zone then me
[19:18:29] <MootPoot> so it was like 11pm for them
[19:18:31] <MootPoot> lolololol
[19:18:37] <Sadale> confact, no idea. I don't watch recent animes
[19:18:53] <MootPoot> hey, they told me to work however much I needed to get the job done
[19:18:54] <Sadale> confact, hmm. actually maybe kobayashi maid dragon S. I plan to watch that after it finishs airing.

[19:19:25] <isekaijin> Sadale: Actually, the part that annoys me is the lack of realism about what is possible and what is not. If he had realistic ambitions, I would be more than glad to help... even though I am on vacations, and even though I really want to play Arknights.
[19:19:38] <Sadale> isekaijin, aw
[19:19:47] <Sadale> isekaijin, sad. I've seen people like that.
[19:20:26] <Sadale> isekaijin, lol ask him to hire more people to do the work for whatever he's working on.
[19:20:42] <Sadale> So long he gets the money he could keep hiring people :p
[19:20:49] <MootPoot> ew
[19:20:54] <confact> isekaijin: Kingdom is on netflix, zombie in 1400s(?) and Do bong soon is just a drama of a strong woman. 
[19:21:00] <Sadale> except that I don't think he'd even have the money to hire one person
[19:21:01] <MootPoot> if you spend your time playing arknights you DESERVE to be interuppted
[19:21:09] <MootPoot> ew mobile game
[19:21:14] <confact> isekaijin: if you like drama and fantasy. You should watch Signal and Tunnel (tv show).
[19:21:17] <Sadale> I think he's probably talking about off-work hours
[19:21:28] <isekaijin> confact: I actually like stories of strong women. I enjoyed Akatsuki no Yona.
[19:21:37] <MootPoot> meh
[19:21:44] <MootPoot> she wasnt strong at all
[19:21:52] <MootPoot> she got dragged around by her cock-bois

[19:22:08] <MootPoot> except with a little more sugar of tomboyism on top
[19:22:23] <MootPoot> at least in the first 5 eps before I hard dropped the show

[22:27:16] <MootPoot> yes, but GDDR dosen't play well with cpu workloads

[23:34:50] <Berlin36_> yeah, sounds cool
[23:34:56] <Berlin36_> isn't raspbian for arm64?

[23:35:16] <Berlin36_> oh cool
[23:35:20] <Berlin36_> why not arch 
[23:35:22] <Berlin36_> and i3
[23:35:24] <Bco1981> but... no x64...
[23:35:27] <MootPoot> linux being lightweight is bullshit
[23:35:30] <Berlin36_> oh lol 
[23:35:41] <MootPoot> I installed linux on my computer and it still weighs the same
[23:35:45] <MootPoot> fucking liars
[23:35:46] <Berlin36_> MootPoot, the graphical interface weighs a lot
[23:35:53] <mexen> lol
