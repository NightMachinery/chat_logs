[08:29:12] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> use github issue for bug if it can be reproduced. (re @SpaceVimBot: cefin:matrix.org: Hi, I have some issue with spacevim layers. I found Spacevim and i quiet like it, but indentLine and gitstatus don't work. Is it a known issue ?
[08:29:13] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> I'm with a Debian computer, vim via terminal.
[08:29:14] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> I put enable_indentline and enable_filetree_status on my init.toml but it don't work.)
[08:29:43] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> just send pull request to spacevim github repo. (re @SpaceVimBot: arafat877: could you tell me how to do to collaborate in developping SpaceVim please ???)
