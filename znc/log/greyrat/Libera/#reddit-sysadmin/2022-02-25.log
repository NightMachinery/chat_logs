[13:35:55] <Joe-Developer> lighten the mood a bit
[13:51:55] <dunz0r> Bloody Microsoft and freemium software. Why tf don't Microsoft themselves provide a way to convert an OST-file to a PST :@
[13:52:39] <CptLuxx> because its not needed?
[13:53:04] <CptLuxx> you fucked up in the first place when you need to connvert a ost to pst
[13:53:05] <CptLuxx> lol
[13:53:42] <DrZak> why would you even want to, unless stealing data from the company
[13:56:43] <Cl0udNinja> wouldnt you also need PST for data recovery? EX: legal request? but then I think you'd just hand over the whole OST and let them handle it no?
[13:56:44] <dunz0r> DrZak: User quit a long time ago, someone wants an e-mail in that persons inbox. Account and inbox gone, but the computer hasn't been cleaned yet. I can reach the laptop over RDP, but not with that users credentials, obviously
[13:57:13] <dunz0r> So I'm trying to import it into outlook to look for the email. Bloody annoying is what it is.
[13:58:39] <DrZak> you cant
[13:58:51] <DrZak> since the ost file si bound to the user, as a security measure
[13:58:56] <DrZak> another user cant open it
[13:59:09] <dunz0r> Yep, but if I can convert it to a PST, I can.
[13:59:16] <dunz0r> But all the tools are paid and I'm cheap.
[13:59:35] <DrZak> also, cant
[13:59:38] <teh_f4ll3n> morning, guys! Have you seen Misha? My assault bear

[14:00:41] <dunz0r> I just want to rant, I don't want any help lol
[14:00:55] <DrZak> yea, i meant the conversion, not that you cant open it
[14:00:58] <teh_f4ll3n> no, a polar bear with a twin 30mm AC mounted to it
[14:01:08] <dunz0r> Ugh, guess I'll have to recreate the user in the AD and give it RDP-rights then

[14:05:21] <Joe-Developer> oh
[14:05:22] <Joe-Developer> from the PC
[14:05:56] <dunz0r> Yeah, account gone etc, but I can reach the laptop over RDP. So restored the user blabla, but didn't want to login as that user over RDP, because I thought it was a pain. But it wasn't :D
[14:06:14] <dunz0r> Heck, I'm a linux guy. I'm crap at all this MS-stuff. 
[14:08:21] <Joe-Developer> us ms guys just click buttons and hope things work
[14:08:27] <Joe-Developer> well thats what I do at least
[14:09:59] <dunz0r> Joe-Developer: Same with us Linux-guys when using MS stuff. Except I have no friggin idea what I'm doing most of the time.
[14:10:09] <dunz0r> I need to take an AD-class or something, haha
[14:10:22] <Joe-Developer> ad easy
[14:10:40] <Joe-Developer> and 99% of it you can use via gui so
[14:10:46] <Joe-Developer> double easy B)
[14:11:26] <dunz0r> Hehe, one task I've written down in my todo for today is writing a script for creating new users, since it's so cumbersome and slow to do it via the GUI
[14:12:01] <Joe-Developer> yessss
[14:12:05] <Joe-Developer> powershell makes it so much quicker
[14:12:32] <Joe-Developer> and if you're hybrid you integrate it with AAD and make it license based on role etc. 
[14:12:37] <Joe-Developer> very quicker much good!

[21:24:45] <sideup66> shibboleth: it's not that I need it now
[21:24:50] <sideup66> But it's a futureproof measure
[21:25:37] <sideup66> Having the switch/router on 10gbe mean when isps do start pushing multi lan you can just use it without a change. Maybe a new modem but that's it really. And you know they will because more gbs mean more better
[21:26:05] <sideup66> Point is why not futureproof the backbone so it can handle that and you don't have to touch it
[21:26:10] <sideup66> Unless your system dies
[21:33:39] <shakygator> i need a better router. my edge router x cant handle my fiber
[21:33:45] <shakygator> was looking at the new version
[21:33:53] <shakygator> or building an opensense box
[21:34:19] <thegodsquirrel> my buddy has had great success with opnsense
[21:35:50] <vinrock>  i have a retired watchguard i need to drop something onto
[21:36:04] <vinrock> i think i stated installing pfsense on it then went to rhe bar and never remembered to continue with it
[21:36:18] <sideup66> My thing is get an old micropcs or something with dual 10gbe nics and low power usage
[21:36:42] <sideup66> Then install pfsense (meme not intended), get a 10gbe switch, and a uapac or better
[21:36:42] <vinrock> i wanna use this thing cuz its a 1u appliance with a display
[21:36:49] <sideup66> Run 10gbe to home server
[21:36:51] <sideup66> Dome
[21:36:58] <sideup66> When the AP can do 10gbe upgrade
[21:37:06] <shakygator> i thought people ditched pfsense for opensense
[21:37:08] <sideup66> When endpoints can do it, they get 10gb too
[21:37:25] <sideup66> Just futureproofs
[21:37:27] <thegodsquirrel> I still use pfsense because I have a Netgate box currently
[21:37:35] <shakygator> if i did 10gb it would probably be just for my storage
[21:37:37] <Azem> shakygator: its either opnsense or vyos
[21:37:46] <Azem> I personally use VyOS for my home router
[21:37:47] <sideup66> Until comcrap or whomever push 10gb speeds, my stuff can handle them

[21:51:29] <shakygator> i wish spectrum had like a 10mbps plan for like $10
[21:51:34] <sideup66> So that's an option, right now them and comcrap are matched, if I price in a vps and it's cheaper on tmo
[21:51:38] <sideup66> I might jump ship
[21:51:50] <shakygator> right now i can actually choose between AT&T fiber, Google Fiber, or Spectrum

[22:48:34] <vinrock> i have another shipment scheduled for today, send 2 day air that also looks like it wont be on time
[22:48:42] <vinrock> i was pissed af at ups last week about this
[22:48:57] <vinrock> i just came across a notice buried on ups' website that the shipment guarantees have ben suspended sine 4/1/2021
[22:49:01] <vinrock> real fuckin cute
[22:49:06] <shibboleth> burger king? meh... after having been there i "burp" the taste of bk for days
[22:49:17] <vinrock> they'll sell you their 'guaranteed' service for a fuckton of money and then just be like sorry we suspended the guarantee

[22:53:48] <kerat58> vinrock:  Wow, how unethical.  Sell something that you don't offer
[22:54:09] <kerat58> Sounds like organised theft to me.  You pay if you don't need the service. If you pay and do need the service, THEN there is no service :)
[22:56:53] <int0x1C8> but who was phone?
[22:57:17] <shibboleth> he haz cheezburger
[22:57:30] <DrGibby> but WHO WAS PHONE?!
[22:57:30] <PublicWifi> DrGibby: GIBBS (that better JollyRgrs? :P )
[22:57:36] <shibboleth> DrGibby, launch all zig
[22:57:39] <DrGibby> hey maccas
[22:57:54] <DrGibby> time to get back to work. Lunch is over.
[22:57:54] <PublicWifi> how was your lunch
[22:58:02] <shibboleth> fried
[22:58:09] <DrGibby> lunch? Whats that?
[22:58:24] <PublicWifi> lol
[22:59:16] <PublicWifi> salmon patties and mashed taters for lunch today
[22:59:42] <shibboleth> taters? i mean, you generally don't wanna eat something gas-inducing for lunch, but hey
[23:00:10] <shibboleth> ah, nvm, confused it with something else
[23:00:40] <vinrock> how tf do i tell windows to stop searching file contents
[23:00:42] <PublicWifi> I'm not scared of having farts at work
[23:01:01] <PublicWifi> in fact
[23:01:02] <DrGibby> me either
[23:01:06] * DrGibby farts https://gibbyfarts.com/#nft
[23:01:09] <PublicWifi> I like farting at work, people stay out of my office then
[23:01:11] <PublicWifi> :D
[23:01:13] <estranger> ahhhh deep diving into RPO0 talk next... these are fun
[23:01:24] <estranger> kinda impossible when you dig in heh
[23:01:25] <shibboleth> what, you're selling nft farts?
[23:01:59] <estranger> well not impossible but theres a shitton to think about
[23:02:09] <PublicWifi> estranger: pls explani for a layman
[23:02:11] <PublicWifi> explain*
[23:02:39] * fritzwastaken farts https://gibbyfarts.com/#nft
[23:02:50] <fritzwastaken> MORNIN
[23:02:57] <DrGibby> well, my talk on security for Monday needs to be revamped entirely 
[23:03:06] <PublicWifi> just invite some vampires
[23:03:07] <PublicWifi> hueuheuheuhe
[23:03:10] <fritzwastaken> Mondays are dangerous
[23:03:12] <DrGibby> HUEHUEHUEHUEHUEHUEHUEHUEHUEHUEHUE
[23:03:31] <estranger> [DB] --> [App] --> [Kafka] ... we need RPO0 ... ok so kafka can do RPO0 by saying any message ack'd by kafka is in multiple data centers.... but what happens when data is going between DB and App when the data center explodes? how do you keep track of what was in the App when russia nuked your DC?
[23:03:37] <fritzwastaken> s/HUE/HURPIDY 
[23:03:37] <layer8> DrGibby meant: "HURPIDY HURPIDY HURPIDY HURPIDY HURPIDY HURPIDY HURPIDY HURPIDY HURPIDY HURPIDY HURPIDY "
[23:03:38] <monr0e> fritzwastaken is that a fraudulent fart I see?
[23:03:42] <shibboleth> dog did it
[23:03:50] <PublicWifi> YOU HAVE A LOICENSE FOR THAT FART?
[23:03:58] <fritzwastaken> monr0e: never, I am a walking billboard for https://gibbyfarts.com/#nft
[23:04:10] <estranger> so when you get into more complex architectures with lots of layers you need to work out rpo0 for every layer, not just your persistence layer 
[23:04:13] <monr0e> I don't know if that is something to put on a resume...
[23:04:15] <fritzwastaken> I even say it outloud IRL like Twitch streamers say Pog
[23:04:16] <PublicWifi> estranger: I see what you mean by "impossible"
[23:04:29] <PublicWifi> pog?
[23:04:42] <fritzwastaken> Boomer
[23:04:49] <PublicWifi> only pog I know is pawg ;D
[23:05:05] <fritzwastaken> Only Pawg I know if your wife
[23:05:13] <PublicWifi> ohh pog
[23:05:14] <monr0e> monka
[23:05:17] <estranger> when yer talking 100k,  1MM, ++ messages per second a blip of a couple ms can be a lot of messages 
[23:05:19] <PublicWifi> so that's why people say POGGERS
[23:05:30] <fritzwastaken> DocLeave
[23:05:38] <estranger> so even if you track what was ack'd by kafka elsewhere.. what if you dont write that ack? and where are you writing those acks? is that rpo0 too?
[23:05:43] <PublicWifi> how much data is in a single "message"?
[23:05:56] <fritzwastaken> as much as you pay her for
[23:06:00] <estranger> you can ack back to the data source .. if the data source supports that... then make sure that data source is rpo0 too
[23:06:05] <estranger> PublicWifi, how long is a stick?
[23:06:11] <PublicWifi> yeah I get that
[23:06:13] <PublicWifi> lol
[23:06:13] <fritzwastaken> his is about 4in
[23:06:15] <PublicWifi> average I wonder
[23:06:17] <estranger> few bytes to a few megs is normal
[23:06:22] <PublicWifi> ah okay
[23:06:23] <estranger> normal is a few k
[23:06:33] <shibboleth> shut up, me
[23:06:34] <shibboleth> meg
[23:06:40] <PublicWifi> just wonder what 100k messages per second looks like throughput wise
[23:06:56] <estranger> can be gigs
[23:07:00] <PublicWifi> neat
[23:07:10] <DrGibby> no u
[23:07:11] <PublicWifi> you have any customers hitting 1tbps?
[23:07:13] <fritzwastaken> nou
[23:07:15] <PublicWifi> DrGibby: :3
[23:07:24] <estranger> ummmm
[23:07:28] <estranger> no dont think so
[23:07:37] <vinrock> ug
[23:07:39] <vinrock> uh
[23:07:47] <vinrock> what can do that
[23:07:50] <vinrock> OC128?
[23:07:59] <PublicWifi> I tried to download a png of cryptic1's mom and my router let the magic smoke out
[23:08:01] <vinrock> theres like a handful of those in the country?
[23:08:16] <estranger> hard to generate 1tbps of messages... even with a fan out.  1 byte in can be X bytes out depending how many consumers you have of that data
[23:08:24] <PublicWifi> ahh okie
[23:08:37] <estranger> 5-10x fanout is not uncommon 
[23:09:06] <vinrock> yeah PublicWifi, there isnt an optical carrier line thats capable of 1tbps
[23:09:16] <vinrock> fastest current is the OC768/40G SONET
[23:09:16] <estranger> say a 100 node cluster and 10gbps nics in each.... could support tbps but thats an insane amount of traffic 
[23:09:26] <PublicWifi> i kinda meant total though
[23:09:33] <PublicWifi> ehh
[23:09:37] <PublicWifi> my ignorance is showing so nvm
[23:09:37] <vinrock> oh i thought you meant someone goin straight beast mode lol
[23:09:39] <PublicWifi> xD
[23:09:41] <PublicWifi> naw
[23:09:49] <PublicWifi> like total db messages over the whole build
[23:09:50] <estranger> yeah 1tbps DR would be near impossible 
[23:09:59] <vinrock> give it another year ot two tho
[23:10:04] <estranger> OH not persec just persisted ?
[23:10:11] <estranger> we get close to PB
[23:10:22] <PublicWifi> nice
[23:10:30] <estranger> actually one customer just did their data projections and came up with 129PB
[23:10:47] <PublicWifi> damn boi
[23:11:01] <estranger> :) will take a couple decades to get up there though
[23:11:01] <PublicWifi> like
[23:11:04] <PublicWifi> 129PB of what though
[23:11:11] <PublicWifi> can't be a DB
[23:11:16] <estranger> they have 40year data retention requirements 
[23:11:20] <PublicWifi> ohhh
[23:11:25] <PublicWifi> just data in general?
[23:11:26] <estranger> and they are using kafka has the system of record for everything
[23:11:29] <PublicWifi> ohhh
[23:11:30] <estranger> events/messages
[23:11:39] <PublicWifi> 129PB of EVENTS/MESSAGES?!
[23:11:43] <estranger> so every DB will just be a view materilized from kafka
[23:11:49] <PublicWifi> a 129PB syslog basically? lmfao
[23:11:54] <estranger> well in an event driven architeture everything in your DB comes from an event
[23:11:56] <estranger> no
[23:12:00] <PublicWifi> okay phew
[23:12:02] <PublicWifi> xD
[23:12:36] <estranger> event: "estranger changed his name to YOURGOD" materializes to updating however many DBs need that info to my new name
[23:12:57] <estranger> event is a thing that happen... you take a stream of events to create your current state 
[23:13:18] <PublicWifi> ah okay I see
[23:13:57] <estranger> https://www.confluent.io/designing-event-driven-systems/ .. read this sometimes.. really good free oreilly book we wrote
[23:14:25] <estranger> its a different way to think of your data
[23:15:21] <PublicWifi> oh thanks Ill bookmark it!
[23:16:49] <Cl0udNinja> sigh
[23:17:27] <Cl0udNinja> making a directory to binary image converter for the flash chips of my project...  the size info isnt adding up. me looking at my code.. https://i.imgur.com/ZZXOE7y.mp4
[23:18:14] *** Joins: wootehfoot (~wootehfoo@user/wootehfoot)
[23:19:23] <Cl0udNinja> making your own filesystem is hard >.>
[23:20:14] <PublicWifi> :S
[23:20:26] <PublicWifi> I've been trying to figure out how to make a filesystem for my z80 build for years...
[23:20:28] <PublicWifi> shit IS hard
[23:20:41] <Cl0udNinja> I mean, I came up with a super simple one, and it works
[23:20:55] <Cl0udNinja> or at least, works in theory..
[23:21:40] <Cl0udNinja> the part I'm working on atm is taking an existing directory, and creating an FS of it as a .bin file, but somewhere I'm fuckin up my math and none of the addresses are matching up
[23:23:53] <PublicWifi> what chips are you using?
[23:24:27] <Cl0udNinja> AT25SF*
[23:24:51] <Cl0udNinja> the 4MB and 16MB versions
[23:24:56] <PublicWifi> oh cool
[23:24:59] <PublicWifi> are you an EE?
[23:25:01] <PublicWifi> your work sounds fun
[23:25:20] <Cl0udNinja> no. this is a project I've been working on for the last 2 years in my own time, and am hoping to make as a product one day
[23:25:47] <PublicWifi> that sounds awesome man
[23:26:05] <PublicWifi> I've never used a chip like that
[23:26:07] <PublicWifi> "code storage"
[23:26:17] <PublicWifi> how is it different than a standard flash chip?
[23:27:02] <Cl0udNinja> idk why they call it 'code storage'
[23:27:06] <Cl0udNinja> its a flash chip lol
[23:27:07] <PublicWifi> yeah its weird lol
[23:27:12] <PublicWifi> xD
[23:27:17] <PublicWifi> BYTES ARE BYTES
[23:27:38] <Cl0udNinja> the FS I built is super basic... theres an Index block, which is 256 bytes, and has 1 bit for every file index, up to 2048 files max. theres a metadata block, which stores the filename, start address, and size. File size is max 65536 bytes. filename/path is max 250 (because 256 - 3 bytes for address, 2 bytes for size, and a nullbyte). since size is a known value (size can be calculated in 2 bytes). every file has a known size, and so 
[23:27:39] <Cl0udNinja> every starting address can be easily known, and mapped into the metadata
[23:28:05] <PublicWifi> oh thats dope
[23:29:03] <PublicWifi> what MCU you using?
[23:29:15] <Cl0udNinja> ESP32-Pico-V4, or at least thats my target
[23:29:52] <PublicWifi> esp32's are great
[23:29:56] <Cl0udNinja> worth noting... I had pretty much minimal electronics experience, and 0 C, or OS type programming experience before statin the project
[23:30:17] <PublicWifi> C is really fun 
[23:30:28] <PublicWifi> itll give you all the rope you need to do the job, and hang youself too
[23:30:30] <PublicWifi> :D
[23:30:44] <Cl0udNinja> I've been learning everything as I go. I even learned FreeCAD so I could design the enclosure and all of its pieces
[23:30:53] <sd> 08<b‚Äãdenlinger> esp32's ***and*** BLE are great togather.
[23:31:06] <PublicWifi> you using KiCAD or anything for the ciruits?
[23:31:08] <Cl0udNinja> no bluetooth or wifi for this project
[23:31:09] <PublicWifi> Eagle
[23:31:10] <Cl0udNinja> yeah kicad
[23:31:12] <PublicWifi> nice
[23:31:30] <PublicWifi> sick man, can't wait to see what you end up making
[23:32:25] <Cl0udNinja> its a long road still. although the board design, I think is pretty much done. and I've been in programming land for the last 6 months or so I think? but ended up having to start over because I realized an Atmel chip just wouldnt cut it
[23:32:38] <PublicWifi> not fast enough?
[23:32:44] <Cl0udNinja> and only 8bit...
[23:32:47] <PublicWifi> yeah true
[23:32:57] <PublicWifi> i think you can do 16bit stuff but it takes double the cycles ofc
[23:32:58] <Cl0udNinja> hard to deal with larger pieces of data, like reading a config file
[23:33:01] <Cl0udNinja> yeah
[23:33:06] <Cl0udNinja> you have to bitshift shit and uhg
[23:33:19] <PublicWifi> have you looked into stm32's and the like?
[23:33:24] <PublicWifi> those are real powerful
[23:33:29] <PublicWifi> little blue pills
[23:34:08] <Cl0udNinja> I think the ESP32 will be more than fast enough for me. Really the only 'fast' thing that needs to happen is loading a web page over ethernet via w5500 phy chip
[23:34:16] <PublicWifi> ahh gotcha
[23:34:42] <Cl0udNinja> is STM32 multicore?
[23:34:55] <Cl0udNinja> I guess I could google that lol
[23:35:03] <PublicWifi> i -THINK- there are dual core options
[23:35:06] <PublicWifi> but I'm not totally sure
[23:35:42] <PublicWifi> they are ARM powered
[23:35:43] <Cl0udNinja> huh... the ESP32 is actually more powerful in terms of speed than the STM32, except for the STM32H7
[23:35:46] <vinrock> ok so
[23:35:55] <vinrock> im in the process of moviung us away from at&t to verizon for this office
[23:36:08] <PublicWifi> yeah and they have other STMxx versions
[23:36:09] <vinrock> when its all said and done im saving around $36,000/yr
[23:36:13] <vinrock> jesus christ
[23:36:30] <PublicWifi> their tools all assume you will use c++ though so I've had some trouble getting my setup going to use my c code
[23:36:38] <PublicWifi> finding a compiler and stuff wasn't super fun
[23:36:53] <PublicWifi> vinrock: nice!
[23:36:59] <Cl0udNinja> actually in general the ESP32 seems to be better than STM32
[23:37:07] <Cl0udNinja> thats pretty wild
[23:37:18] <PublicWifi> depends on your needs I suppose!
[23:37:26] <Cl0udNinja> yeah
[23:37:38] <Cl0udNinja> vinrock, thats wild
[23:37:52] <vinrock> yeah i knew id be saving a chunk, i just realized exactly how much
[23:37:54] *** Quits: nx032 (uid540668@id-540668.ilkley.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[23:38:01] <PublicWifi> stm32's usually have wayyy more I/O pins
[23:38:08] <PublicWifi> and more peripherals 
[23:38:16] <PublicWifi> but esp32's have wifi and all that built in
[23:38:19] <PublicWifi> both are great little MCUs
[23:39:55] <vinrock> If any of you are running Zimbra, CISA just sent an alert about CVE-2022-24682 being actively exploited
[23:43:28] <int0x1C8> why does my shoulder hurt
[23:44:17] <sintax> it's ok to tell the director of IT and remind him about read only friday right? 
[23:44:31] <vinrock> ofc
[23:44:36] <vinrock> int rotator cuff 
[23:44:40] <vinrock> youre getting old
[23:44:46] <technonerd> time to chop it off
[23:45:23] <shibboleth> PublicWifi, it's be far more convenient for those internet-of-shit devices to have intergrated powerline/plc
[23:45:46] <shibboleth> smart lightbulb? why the actual f does it use wifi and not plc...
[23:54:16] <estranger> read only friday is a legacy mindset. fight me
[23:55:38] <estranger> cus wifi is easier and already there
[23:56:35] <estranger> well.. easier cus everyone knows what wifi is and already has coverage
[23:56:47] <estranger> smart devices are catered mostly to tech morons
[23:56:54] <sd> 05<v‚Äãyz> basically
[23:56:55] <Cl0udNinja> PublicWifi, I dont need a ton of IO pins really. I actually have a bunch unused on the ESP32
[23:57:23] <estranger> even my smart light switches.. hardwired in.. use wifi
[23:57:42] <estranger> i need to research smart switches again... gonna have to redo everything
[23:57:55] <estranger> i have idevice now and its just meh
[23:59:23] <Cl0udNinja> 1 I2C pair, 1 UART for programming, 1 SPI for filesystem and eth PHY, or 2 SPI, one for fs and one for PHY, or direct PHY for ethernet. most of the operation is pretty easy and simple. not a lot of realtime data parsing or anything like that. like I said, the biggest process is going to be the webapp and speed of serving up web content
