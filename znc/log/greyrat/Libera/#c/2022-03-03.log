[00:13:05] <fizzie> If this is still in the context of getting larger random numbers than what rand() provides (from the other day), working in terms of bits insteaad of decimal digits will probably make more sense.
[00:14:36] <control> how can i make this part as a return?  printf("%i", a + b)
[00:14:37] <Maxdamantus> The decimal part is okay. The weird part is using a multiplier depending on the logarithm of one of the numbers.
[00:15:14] <Maxdamantus> If you were to combine two random numbers to make one more random number, you wouldn't use some logarithm, as that will probably introduce bias.

[00:37:35] <fizzie> Use a type bigger than `int`. I mean, what you've got there in your example is already a snippet that generates enough bits to fill an `unsigned long`, and create a number between 0 to ULONG_MAX.
[00:38:03] <fizzie> ,cc printf("%d", INT_MAX); // any function with `int` as the return type can't possibly return a larger number than this

[00:42:52] <fizzie> As long as the function is declared `int check_prime(...) { ... }` there's no way you can make it return anything more than an `int`.
[00:43:15] <fizzie> If you want to make it generate an `unsigned long long`, it has to be an `unsigned long long check_prime(...) { ... }` instead.
[00:43:56] <antropez> i guess you could return a void pointer and write the type that was returned, but that is.. probably impractical.
[00:44:14] <antropez> would have to be on the heap or have the location specified outside of the called function.

[02:15:22] <nightstrike> (note the volatile)
[02:16:14] <nightstrike> I'm intending that volatile here is telling gcc that reading from that has side effects (in my case, it generates a potentially slow PIO read over the bus)
[02:16:32] <nightstrike> and I would hope that in the "abstract machine" concept, having that side effect occur twice isn't allowed

[04:33:48] <fizzie> I mean, it's still fine that way too in the almost universal case where uint8_t is just a typedef of unsigned char. Typedefs don't make new types. But I guess you could want to consider the hypothetical case where it's not.
[04:33:50] <snappy> i'm not good at explaining it, but it means you can't do type punning the naive way, you need to use unions
[04:34:59] <constxd> ah i was thinking that if uint8_t exists it is necessarily the same type as unsigned char but yeah i guess that's not true when CHAR_BIT > 8

[04:35:30] <constxd> right that's what i was thinking
[04:35:44] <snappy> but you can't have CHAR_BIT < 8 either?
[04:35:49] <constxd> indeed
[04:36:04] <fizzie> No. I'm talking about the *really* theoretical possibility where CHAR_BIT is 8, uint8_t exists, but instead of being an alias of `unsigned char`, it's an alias of an implementation-defined extended integer type that happens to be 8 bits but is not the same type as `unsigned char`.

[04:42:17] <fizzie> Most systems already have a pair of standard integer types (either `long` & `long long`, or `int` & `long`, or even more rarely `short` & `int`) that have an identical representation but aren't compatible types, and not allowed by C11 6.5p7 (the "strict aliasing" / "effective type" rules) to be used interchangeably. So it's not _entirely_ ridiculous the same could be the case for `unsigned char` and

[06:13:22] <kurahaupo> yolo: "Everyone" should not use the fixed width types, except to typedef semantic type names like uid_t, or where binary modulus arithmetic is an essential part of the algorithm. There point of using plain "int" is precisely because the algorithm doesn't care how big the numeric type is, as long as it's "big enough", and that in the future it will grow so that larger machines can do more with the same program.

[06:28:11] <kurahaupo> Come to think of it, does the 6502 actually have add without carry, or does it just need you to clear the carry bit first? The Z80 and 8080 have separate add and add-with-carry opcodes. The PDP-11 has "add carry" but not "add with carry", hence the quadratic number of instructions for implementing bignum arithmetic

[10:43:27] <masoudd> ldd shows you dynamically linked libraries
[10:44:35] <masoudd> and for making things static, you need to recompile it with the right flags and have the static version of those libraries available.

[14:20:32] <Xeroine> if I had code that I want to at least compile on 32bit and 64bit CPUs and I have integers that usually will be small enough to fit in 32 bit unsigned int but might eventually exceed that should I use size_t? afaik size_t should be 32 bit unsigned int on 32 bit CPUs and 64 bit unsigned int on 64 bit CPUs.

[21:18:42] <fizzie> There's a snippet in the C rationale that explains why there's no support for the equality operator on aggregate types, but it's not one I've saved for easy pasting. Paraphrasing though, it cites the spirit of C for not expanding == into an arbitrary amount of per-member comparisons, and how due to padding just comparing blobs of memory generally isn't sufficient.

[23:25:59] <fizzie> pendarsoheil: If you're asking why the `printBits` function just prints a load of zeroes, that's because its parameter is an `int`. Passing a float value to a function that takes an int just converts the number to an integer by discarding the fractional part (if the result can be represented in an int). It doesn't show the bits of the float's object representation.
