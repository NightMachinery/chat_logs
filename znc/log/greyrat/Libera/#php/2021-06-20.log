[16:21:37] <leitz> I'm getting "the name is already in use" when running tests, is it because each tests has require statements?   https://github.com/TheUnseenServant/uss_chargen/blob/auto_prefs/tests/ThiefTest.php
[16:22:32] <leitz> Running phpunit on the tests directory and I get:      PHP Fatal error:  Cannot declare class Character, because the name is already in use in /home/leam/lang/git/theunseenservant/uss_chargen/lib/character.php on line 12
[16:22:41] <Naktibalda> yes, use require_once for files containing classes and functions or setup autoloading
[16:23:27] <da_wunder> I would recommend to use autoloading
[16:24:42] <leitz> Naktibalda, thanks! That works.
[16:25:10] <Naktibalda> prefs, names and mins don't belong to lib/ they should probably be in config/ dir
[16:25:27] <leitz> da_wunder, While I agree in theory, PHP is not my native language. I'm helping someone out, and just trying to add some tests to my work.

[16:26:35] <leitz> Naktibalda, thanks! That may happen, though "prefs.php" needs to go away. Today's goal is to autogenerate the data from $mins.
[16:26:52] <Naktibalda> html and css files should be in the same directory as index.php and they shouldn't be at project root, popular convention is to put them to public/ dir
[16:27:20] <da_wunder> and you should only expose that public directory to internet, nothing else
[16:27:42] *** Joins: entuland (~entuland@user/entuland)
[16:28:36] <Naktibalda> don't add ?> at the bottom of php files
[16:29:37] <Naktibalda> is your project based on some old PHP4 project?
[16:36:18] <da_wunder> also I would use short array syntax, and I would not mix things like $mode = 'short'; $races = array("human", "dwarf"); use either ' or " everywhere (and yes there are special use cases for both, but seems like that is not the case in that project)
[16:37:59] <Naktibalda> var keyword for properties and not specifying visibility of methods looks like PHP4 code.
[16:39:01] <da_wunder> another main point is that in your test classes you have `use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;` but that project doesn't contain `composer.json` - so you're assuming that people have phpunit installed to global scope
[16:40:00] <Naktibalda> the audience consists of him and his friend.
[16:41:47] <da_wunder> and tests like "$character = new Character(...); $this->assertInstanceOf(Character:class, $character);" is useless - that cannot be falsy in any case (or could if that Character class construct eg. throws an exception, and if that is the use case you should test that exception)

[21:23:52] <__adrian> laravel (et.al) are fully-featured, sefl-contained systems that can be used to make basically anything. further, they match the way novice developers think, so resonate and are very popular
[21:25:13] <Rockwood> twhat is et.al? __adrian hi how are you sir?
[21:26:13] <__adrian> yes, lots of crummy code, hidden magic, and extremely tight coupling
[21:26:29] <__adrian> but it "works" in the moment and iterates rapidly
[21:26:37] <__adrian> Rockwood: it means "and others"
[21:27:42] <Rockwood> really simplicity is the best always __adrian
[21:29:11] <matiss> inb4 laravel being banned from orgs en-masse
[21:30:44] <__adrian> meh, won't happen
[21:31:01] <matiss> it already is
[21:31:46] <matiss> I've been told about orgs listing laravel as forbidden in coding tests (as in use any framework, except for laravel), I know several orgs explicitly listing laravel as prohibited
[21:32:06] <Rockwood> gn
[21:32:08] <matiss> in fact, in the last org I worked for, laravel use was not quite banned, but was heavily frowned uppon
[21:32:09] <Rockwood> cya
[21:32:43] <__adrian> well, that's nice and all, but doesn't really sound like "banned en masse"  :)
[21:32:51] <Rockwood> matiss, you are wasting time on nothing :P
[21:32:58] <Rockwood> cya gn
[21:32:59] <matiss> I know, I have time to waste

[21:37:56] <da_wunder> imho - Laravel is messed up totally - personally I would recommend to use Symfony instead

[21:38:48] <da_wunder> and same here - just personal preference

[21:43:36] <ericlee> Hi, is there any example about how to use PHP to handle large file upload by PUT method? I'm trying to use fread to handle php://input stream and I found it's still reading all data into memory.
[21:44:03] <ericlee> I use php -S localhost 9999 for testing.
[21:44:55] <da_wunder> I would recommend you to use the same webserver that you're using on your production vs php builtin server
[21:45:39] <da_wunder> because there are multiple php.ini settings that can have effect to that and same goes for the webserver config
[21:45:43] *** Quits: brickfat (~brickfat@user/brickfat) (Quit: Leaving)
[21:47:10] <__adrian> https://php.net/features.file-upload.put-method
[21:47:26] <__adrian> and yes, fread() does read the file  :)
[21:48:09] <ericlee> and even I add the buffer size it's still reading thw whole file into memory?
[21:48:52] <__adrian> it will read the whole file. whether the whole file is going to be in memory _at once_ depends on what your script does with it
[21:49:35] <ericlee> __adrian, I'm using the quite similar method that php website mentions.
[21:50:23] <ericlee> because I'm thinking to upload 10G file would take 10G RSS that's horrible :(
[21:56:54] <__adrian> no
[21:57:16] <__adrian> the example there don't keep it all in memory; it reads and then writes
[21:59:52] <ericlee> __adrian, so there must be something wrong on the implementation, I do see all data is read into memory with huge RSS.
[22:02:04] <__adrian> don't know
[22:02:28] <__adrian> and i've never tried PUT with php -S, so... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[22:03:15] <__adrian> btw +1 for a real dev env. php -S is for messing around and very simple examlpes; it's not suited for much else.
[22:03:23] <__adrian> (and is not meant to be)
[22:03:37] <biberu> ericlee: are you trying to upload 10GB?
