[19:54:41] <Hemish[m]> Because glibc blanked out
[19:54:47] <Hemish[m]> Which is required for chrooting
[19:54:59] <Arya[m]> update glibc on usb?
[19:55:06] <MohdAariz[m]> wait
[19:55:06] <Arya[m]> jic
[19:55:20] <Hemish[m]> Arya[m]: Glibc on installed system is blown out
[19:55:23] <MohdAariz[m]> can i like install glibv on my usb and then move to my arch install?
[19:55:34] <Hemish[m]> Glibc of installed system is required for chroot
[19:55:44] <Hemish[m]> MohdAariz[m]: Glibc is already installed on usb
[19:55:47] <MohdAariz[m]> i can cd into mnt
[19:56:04] <MohdAariz[m]> Hemish[m]: so i can do it
[19:56:06] <Arya[m]> wait
[19:56:24] <Arya[m]> idk whether this will work but i will say it anyways
[19:56:31] <Arya[m]> you get arch bootstrap
[19:56:41] <Arya[m]> and override all the files  with ti
[19:56:57] <MohdAariz[m]> but wont that
[19:56:59] <MohdAariz[m]> OHHH
[19:57:08] <Hemish[m]> Arya[m]: What's the command of bootstrap called I forgot
[19:57:13] <Arya[m]> no not that
[19:57:16] <MohdAariz[m]> pacstrap
[19:57:19] <Arya[m]> i was talking about a different thing
[19:57:26] <Arya[m]> but pacsrtap will werk too
[19:57:31] <Arya[m]> didnt think about that lmao
[19:57:39] <MohdAariz[m]> m
[19:57:39] <MohdAariz[m]> lol
[19:58:05] <Hemish[m]> Do this:
[19:58:05] <Hemish[m]> pacstrap -c /mnt glibc mkinitpcio
[19:58:29] <Arya[m]> what does -c do
[19:58:35] <Hemish[m]> It doesn't dowbload new package
[19:58:40] <Arya[m]> wait idk whether this will help but after that, if you can chroot 
[19:58:43] <Arya[m]> do this
[19:58:43] <Hemish[m]> And just uses locally installed package
[19:58:57] <Hemish[m]> Cuz most probably he is not connected to internet in live medium
[19:59:02] <Arya[m]> pacman -Sy `pacman -Q | awk'{print $1}'`
[19:59:16] <Arya[m]> Hemish[m]: its super simple i just byhearted it lmao
[19:59:18] <Arya[m]> iwctl and then
[19:59:29] <Arya[m]> station wlan0 connect network
[19:59:36] <Hemish[m]> Arya[m]: Live medium doesn't come with iwctl
[19:59:40] <MohdAariz[m]> i have ethernet
[19:59:44] <MohdAariz[m]> so iam
[19:59:45] <MohdAariz[m]> connected
[19:59:45] <Hemish[m]> It comes with wpa supplicant
[19:59:50] <Hemish[m]> MohdAariz[m]: Then fine
[19:59:53] <Arya[m]> Hemish[m]: it has iwctl
[19:59:56] <Hemish[m]> You can skip -c option then

[20:00:07] <Hemish[m]> >

[21:06:41] <NeoVoid[m]> <Hemish[m]> "How can I connect to znc...." <- in your znc web panel you add a network and save it. 
[21:06:41] <NeoVoid[m]> then you open irc app connect to this znc network instead of irc.libera.chat you connect to znc.gnulinuxindia.org with port 1079 and password will look like this <znc_username>/<network_name>:<znc_password>
