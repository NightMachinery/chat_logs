[07:05:55] <ButterNoodle> unless ur root the phone.
[07:06:09] <ButterNoodle> but it doesnt matter bc tether is free
[07:06:19] <MootPoot> No, not really, it depends if you buy the unlocked phone from your carrier or the maker website
[07:06:41] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: u talking usb tether or wifi ap?
[07:06:52] <MootPoot> if you get it from the maker website it dosen't get that shitty OS carrier version

[10:50:44] <Nanobot> The OTE short zone is where bearish traders are looking to sell/short. If the price rises above the top of that range, it's a sign that the interest in selling has dried up, which means the rise can rise a lot more easily from there.
[10:51:45] <Nanobot> (However, it's generally a bad idea to buy inside the OTE short zone, because, by definition, the price is high. Buy low, sell high.)

[11:24:00] <KatrinValerie> Let me know when the lore I write for you becomes inappropriate please.
[11:24:33] <KatrinValerie> I mean, it's a channel tradition sort of, but that doesn't mean it can't spiral out of control.
[11:24:43] <beaky> woah beaky doujins?
[11:24:49] <[1]tcsilver> beaky is from a project based on Soilder from FF7 who was plugged up to a machine for some years and has come back to life as AI
[11:25:00] <[1]tcsilver> ?
[11:25:03] <KatrinValerie> beaky: I would consider things out of control at that point.
[11:25:09] <KatrinValerie> But now you put the idea in my head.
[11:25:35] <KatrinValerie> It would have to be a multiverse, because we still don't know your true nature and I want to cover all the theories that have been going around.
[11:25:35] <beaky> tifa from ff7 is kawaii
[11:25:43] <[1]tcsilver> yep, yep.
[11:25:51] <[1]tcsilver> i like yuffie
[11:26:02] <[1]tcsilver> or such
[11:26:34] <[1]tcsilver> :) you guys have the best channel

[11:27:44] <KatrinValerie> Thank you
[11:28:12] <KatrinValerie> Praise makes my already massive ego swell up even more
[11:28:13] <amigojapan> beaky: if you are ai maybe you can marry kizuna AI
[11:28:24] <[1]tcsilver> lol
[11:28:27] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: I think kizuna AI is just an actor playing an AI.

[11:29:09] <KatrinValerie> unless the AI has a physical body
[11:29:11] <KatrinValerie> then it could work
[11:29:45] <KatrinValerie> Oh wait, no that constraint actually doesn't apply now that I think about it.
[11:30:00] <KatrinValerie> There's this guy from Japan who has a relationship with a rather primitive AI.
[11:30:13] <amigojapan> Brb
[11:30:28] <KatrinValerie> beaky is obviously a general AI and much more advanced than any technology known to the public.
[11:30:43] <KatrinValerie> Maybe one day beaky will become skynet
[11:30:51] <[1]tcsilver> and master taichi
[11:31:03] <KatrinValerie> And I will become a high priestress to beaky, for I created some of the lore.

[11:53:27] <KatrinValerie> Also I think they don't have too many guy friends, which feeds into the dynamic.
[11:53:33] <Urchin[emacs]> KatrinValerie: eh, IIRC, their daddy was all "go for it"
[11:53:37] <KatrinValerie> And it's quite realistic that nothing really happens
[11:53:59] <KatrinValerie> Urchin[emacs]: I don't remember, wasnt there a catch that made it okay like them being stepsisters or something?
[11:54:57] <KatrinValerie> I had this kind of dynamic with my younger sister sort of, but neither of us would have taken it further than cuddling a little bit more than siblings usually would.

[17:52:22] <Bco1981> ButterNoodle: classic mac, how old are we talking ?
[17:52:29] <darkwitch> Imagine a tree (no particular kind) that burned down to a charred black, fell into a mossy/gross swamp for a few weeks, now dig up that charred tree and take a whiff lol...
[17:52:36] <darkwitch> Or imagine a house whose interior caught on fire, yet still stands and is structurally sound. This house has gone untouched for years, through all sorts of seasonal/weather changes... Now step into this house and inhale the old, moldy/musty, damp, charred interior... All this comes to mind as soon as I smell this stuff.

[18:48:56] <JesseDesu> my grandpa still rides a motorcycle

[18:49:15] <HubertFarnsworth> emmeka: here people have nothing to talk about
[18:49:34] <emmeka> HubertFarnsworth my paternal grandparents were born in the Netherlands. My great grandfather was Dutch resistance, and the Nazis burned his farm, so he left for Canada after the war. My grandmother's family had their farm destroyed in the floods of 1953 there
[18:49:56] <HubertFarnsworth> woah

[18:50:03] <JesseDesu> 1953 was when the korean war ended
[18:50:11] <HubertFarnsworth> now that's living
[18:50:13] <emmeka> at the time there was a deal for some European ethnicities to come to the country and work as an indentured labourer for a farm here for 5 years in exchange for citizenship

[18:50:14] <amigojapan> That darkwitch 
[18:50:48] <HubertFarnsworth> emmeka: so you probably still have cousins over in Netherlands?
[18:51:00] <darkwitch> amigojapan, it's not too late to change
[18:51:10] <emmeka> HubertFarnsworth I wouldn't know, but I assume.
[18:51:27] <amigojapan> darkwitch: unfortunately Christmas is coming again soon
[18:51:37] <emmeka> my grandparents never went back, they haven't seen their home country since they left it on a boat called the SS Volendam in the 1950s
[18:51:55] <HubertFarnsworth> emmeka: Was your mom born in Canada or Netherlands?
[18:52:06] <amigojapan> darkwitch: I am ok with Yule
[18:52:06] <HubertFarnsworth> emmeka: did she lived through the war?
[18:52:07] <emmeka> HubertFarnsworth my mother isn't Dutch, my father is.
[18:52:18] <HubertFarnsworth> ah
[18:52:25] <emmeka> he was born here.
[18:52:33] <amigojapan> darkwitch: and I love festivus
[18:53:33] <HubertFarnsworth> amigojapan: I have a lot of complains
[18:53:37] <HubertFarnsworth> to air
[18:53:46] <darkwitch> amigojapan, get a bottle of By The Fireplace and enjoy the smell of warm chestnuts roasting on a wood stove with a christmas vanilla cake baking in the background
[18:53:57] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: wait for December 23
[18:54:19] <HubertFarnsworth> yes amigojapan, festivus for the rest of us
[18:54:46] <amigojapan> darkwitch: Christmas cake is strawberry short cake
[18:54:53] <emmeka> HubertFarnsworth I didn't have a huge amount of exposure to anything Dutch, besides Christmas.
[18:54:59] <amigojapan> Hahaha HubertFarnsworth 
[18:55:12] <emmeka> HubertFarnsworth my grandparents raised me when I was young but they were pretty strong believers in assimilation
[18:55:33] <emmeka> I guess I did have quintessential Dutch frugality drilled into me
[18:56:13] <amigojapan> emmeka: many immigrants are strong believers in assimilation
[18:56:14] <darkwitch> amigojapan, imagine any cake you like
[18:56:20] <emmeka> HubertFarnsworth this is the small tragedy of the Americas I guess, everyone has these stories, but most of us have no connection to real culture
[18:56:31] <amigojapan> Ok thanks darkwitch 
[18:56:43] <emmeka> which is how everyone ends up engrossed in new world culture and traditions instead
[18:56:51] <darkwitch> as long as there is some vanilla in it
[18:57:44] <amigojapan> darkwitch: I like vanilla. But not on strawberry short cake
[18:57:50] <HubertFarnsworth> emmeka: culture would end up changing anyways regardless of people moved to different places
[18:58:31] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: especially with the internet
[18:58:48] <HubertFarnsworth> yeah

[20:36:18] <Cryowolf> MootPoot, if you could use a 100% stable FUSION reactor to power an entire planet if your choice, terraform it and so on. Would you bring people to it, or would you create bioids? (biological constructs designed/created by machine technology)
[20:36:32] <Cryowolf> bioids are basically biological androids
[20:37:14] <Cryowolf> and give them tasks, programs and so on? to prevent wars, you would make it impossible for themto ever conceive of it
[20:37:32] <JesseDesu> what kind of questions are these
[20:38:00] <JesseDesu> and why does mootpoot's answers matter
[20:38:57] <Cryowolf> it doesn't
[20:39:11] <MootPoot> uh
[20:39:20] <MootPoot> j,,
[20:39:23] <Cryowolf> You could answer too JesseDesu, if you want
[20:39:34] <MootPoot> do the bioids look like humans
[20:39:46] <ButterNoodle> where can I find hungry girls
[20:40:07] <Cryowolf> I ask questions like these to help me create characters in my stories, where I create a trail of abstract
[20:40:19] <Cryowolf> MootPoot, you can make them look like anything

[20:46:09] <Cryowolf> in the future when everyones eyes are augmented by nanites, you will be guided by a 100% realistic looking waitress (no more uncanny valleys) to your seat and the "hooters girl", taking your order doesn't exist.
[20:46:15] <SpiritOfSummer> one of the best stress relievers ever
[20:46:21] <Bco1981> SpiritOfSummer: was it a oculus headset ?
[20:46:29] <Cryowolf> Then a robot shows up with your menu
[20:46:46] <SpiritOfSummer> you put it over your head and your eyeballs see you in a virtual environment

[20:47:13] <JesseDesu> theres 4 red motorcycles on my block
[20:47:20] <Cryowolf> MootPoot, that's what happens when you board the titanic in its final hour
[20:48:03] <ButterNoodle> 2 dudes on a moto mean someones getting robbed
[20:48:10] <SpiritOfSummer> for the last 4 days all of my jizz has smelled like coffee
[20:48:34] <ButterNoodle> SpiritOfSummer: did it taste like coffee?
[20:48:40] <SpiritOfSummer> yeah but that's normal
[20:49:06] <MootPoot> I shouldnt abuse stimulants
[20:49:07] <MootPoot> the way I do
[20:49:16] <pteague> la palma has been cumming a lot lately ...
[20:49:19] <MootPoot> I've been drinking 3 cans of monster a day
[20:49:27] <JesseDesu> thats nothing
[20:49:59] <SpiritOfSummer> those aren't kyle numbers
[20:50:00] <pteague> the playas in the canary islands are not safe ...
[20:50:33] <Cryowolf> 3 cans of 0.5L monster?
[20:50:51] <Cryowolf> that it has 32mg caffeine per 100ml?
[20:51:04] <MootPoot> I cant do math right now
[20:51:05] <MootPoot> too early
[20:51:11] <Cryowolf> that's not even 200mgs of coffee
[20:51:12] <MootPoot> but its like 150mg per can
[20:51:13] <MootPoot> or so
[20:51:29] <Cryowolf> yes per can it's that
[20:51:35] <Bco1981> let Imouto do it for you
[20:51:50] <JesseDesu> i drink 2 cans of bang energy sometimes 
[20:51:54] <JesseDesu> each with 300mg caffeine
[20:51:58] <MootPoot> damn you bang a lot
[20:52:22] <Cryowolf> I could probably feel fine on it even if I took 500mgs of caffeine at once, so it all hit me at once and not overtime like a drink
[20:52:23] <Bco1981> Calli has bang too
[20:52:33] <Cryowolf> but I can fall asleep after drinking a monster
[20:52:37] <Bco1981> some weird flavours
[20:52:56] <Cryowolf> like within the next hour or so after or later than that, or earlier
[20:53:03] <JesseDesu> 1 can of redbull has literally no effect on me
[20:53:10] <JesseDesu> i need at least 4 or 5
[20:53:51] <JesseDesu> caffeine is a chemical made by plants as a natural insecticide

[23:06:13] <MootPoot> if you get the resin printers
[23:06:14] <MootPoot> then yes
[23:06:31] <MootPoot> the filament ones not so much unless you're talking big bucks
[23:06:48] <MootPoot> even the cheap resin ones do wonders
[23:06:49] <MootPoot> tbh
[23:06:55] <MootPoot> although you still have to paint yourself
