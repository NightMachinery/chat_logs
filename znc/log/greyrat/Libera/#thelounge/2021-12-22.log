[02:03:37] <thelounge9179> Hi. I accidentally deleted a server from my thelounge installation. I created it and I'm trying to restore the logs but it doesn't seem to be working. I moved them between /etc/thelounge/logs/UserName/network-guid/ to the new network-guid, but after refresh and also a restart it doesn't seem to be loading in the historic logs in the buffer.
[02:03:37] <thelounge9179> Additionally i am watching it via tail -f, it is currently /writing/ to the files correctly. Just not reloading in the older logs in the browser
[02:04:07] <thelounge9179> if I refresh it brings in post-recreation logs, so I take it there might be some kind of create-date filter maybe?

[02:21:56] <ScottD42> Good day all.  I've been using The Lounge in a Docker container just fine for some time.  Today, I can only get the following:

[02:22:24] <ScottD42> Google is being useless in finding any information.   Any ideas?   Thanks!

[03:03:33] <thelounge9179> i ran an SQL query and corrected it :)
[03:03:37] <thelounge9179> thanks for the advice
[03:08:47] <joakim> Has anyone here set up thelounge over a reverse tcp tunnel, like packetriot or ngrok?
[03:09:23] <thelounge9179> what is the issue you're having
[03:10:15] <joakim> Just curious before I start digging into the problem. I get alternating 'waiting to reconnect' and 'xhr poll error' messages.
[03:10:54] <thelounge9179> Well, for nginx, you have to set custom headers to get the websockets stuff working, so I imagine it's something to do with that
[03:11:08] <thelounge9179>                 proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
[03:11:08] <thelounge9179>                 proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
[03:11:19] <joakim> That sounds plausible.
[03:11:19] <thelounge9179> so perhaps that could be a starting point for you, with ngrok
[03:11:24] <joakim> Cheers, thanks
[03:11:26] <thelounge9179> I'm shooting from the hip tho
[03:11:28] <thelounge9179> I could be 100% wrong
[03:11:57] <joakim> Btw, thanks for a great piece of software, brings me back to the irc days of the 90s, but in a much more convenient and device agnostic manner :)

[05:15:22] <bookworm> what do you mean by hostmask?
[05:15:53] <thelounge1496> like when it says you've joined the channel and you see the default one as like thelounge@whatever.net
[05:16:36] <thelounge1496> when you right click on someone and see the user info it's there too
[05:16:45] <bookworm> which part of it? you have nick!user@host
[05:17:18] <bookworm> the user part you can change from within TL, host is a reverse DNS based on your IP and you need to set a PTR record if you want a vanity name there
[05:17:28] <thelounge1496> oooh right
[05:17:44] <thelounge1496> is the user part just the Username section of the config

[14:21:43] <majavah> how did you install it?
[14:22:19] <newdimension> majavah: I don't really remember how I installed it. I don't have yarn installed on the system so I assumed I used apt
