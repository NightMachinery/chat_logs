[13:06:10] <novns> Ronalds_Mazitis_, your regular expression is unreadable, but you can call another preg_replace with your additional patterns
[13:08:10] <TinoDidriksen> Adding more ranges to that regex is trivial. Just add them.
[13:09:56] <AllenJB> Might be easier to specify what is allowed o_O
[13:10:26] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> novns but it works
[13:10:40] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> and calling another one just deletes string
[13:11:15] <AllenJB> Tip for large regexs: Use x modifier then you can better format the regex (with whitespace / line returns) and add comments
[13:13:14] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> so how do I add them?

[13:16:03] *** Joins: catbeard (~noise@user/catbeard)
[13:17:01] <TinoDidriksen> The same way you wrote the large regex. Just put the ranges into where other ranges are.
[13:18:41] <TinoDidriksen> E.g. '/[\x{1F600}-\x{1F64F}]/u' plus '/[\x{1F300}-\x{1F5FF}]/u' can be combined into '/[\x{1F600}-\x{1F64F}\x{1F300}-\x{1F5FF}]/u'
[13:21:19] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> "/[\x{1F600}-\x{1F64F}]\x{1F300}-\x{1F5FF}][\x{1F680}-\x{1F6FF}]\x{2600}-\x{26FF}]\x{2700}-\x{27BF}]/u"
[13:21:33] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> just adding this to large one?
[13:21:37] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> I did not write it
[13:21:45] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> I use it
[13:22:21] <AllenJB> What is the purpose of this regex?
[13:22:38] <TinoDidriksen> You did not combine those correctly.

[14:33:33] <Simplar> If the variable `$foo` has array in it, and then I do `$bar = $foo`, and after that something like `$bar['some_new_key_not_in_foo'] = some_value`, will `$foo` be modified, since php passes arrays by reference?
[14:34:24] <AllenJB> No. You'd have to explicitly set $bar as a reference ($bar =& $foo) for that to happen
[14:34:56] <AllenJB> Not sure where you're getting "PHP passes arrays by reference" from.

[14:37:04] <Simplar> https://www.php.net/manual/en/arrayobject.getarraycopy.php what's the sense of this then?
[14:39:10] <AllenJB> ArrayObject is not the same as a (scalar) array. It's an object that behaves like an array for most purposes.
[14:39:49] <Simplar> Does PHP have something like JavaScript's template literals?
[14:40:33] <no_gravity> Simplar: Template literals, yes. Tagged template literals, no.
[14:40:37] <Simplar> for example, to use `$xyz = some_value` in a string without dot concatenation operator.
[14:40:49] <Simplar> `"hello $xyz"`, right?
[14:41:00] <no_gravity> Tagged template literals would be one of my primary wishes when it comes to PHP features.
[14:41:11] <no_gravity> Simplar: echo "hello $xyz";
[14:41:15] <Simplar> Well, I don't need them to be tagged :)
[14:41:37] <Simplar> So... it's enough for me if I can put a variable inside without 'a'.$varible.'b'.$anothervariable kind of thing
[14:41:56] <AllenJB> Simplar: You can use variables inside double-quoted strings in PHP - see https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php#language.types.string.parsing.simple

[14:48:35] <Simplar> https://3v4l.org/Q7UQe Why is that outputting null?
[14:48:42] <Simplar> It's supposed to build a list of correct params
[14:49:34] <no_gravity> Do I really have to manually compile a list of "Unusual whitespace and non printable chars"? Hmm... I cannot find any pre-made list.
[14:49:55] <no_gravity> Simplar: That is not a minimal example.
[14:50:03] <Simplar> What is then?

[21:11:27] <Blondie101010> I would have simplified the test more but lets see
[21:11:33] <sumthing1980> in cli it shows the correct filesize in web it is the previous filesize
[21:11:41] <sumthing1980> yea its messy sry
[21:12:16] <Blondie101010> how do you pass $_GET to your CLI command?
[21:13:22] <sumthing1980> I just set it
[21:13:40] <Blondie101010> I'll just remove it
[21:13:44] <sumthing1980> $_GET['feed']=1;
[21:14:13] <Blondie101010> which implies you're not testing the same code
[21:14:40] <sumthing1980> it is part of a longer script that shows html in case get feed is not set
[21:15:06] <Blondie101010> I get that... so you need to make it standalone
[21:15:24] <sumthing1980> or just remove first if isset

[21:19:32] <sumthing1980> do you get the same thing
[21:21:35] <Blondie101010> it reacts immediately....  what you're noticing is how your browser reacts to a new line of data
[21:22:14] <sumthing1980> yes?
[21:22:19] <Blondie101010> I tested it with wget to see how it goes
[21:22:37] <Blondie101010> at first it gets 0 bytes until the instant it detects a change
[21:22:48] <Blondie101010> so you're troubleshooting the wrong issue
[21:22:48] <sumthing1980> yes
[21:23:09] <Blondie101010> it's an output problem to your browser
[21:25:10] <Blondie101010> did you try: Content-Type: text/plain
[21:25:45] <sumthing1980> no
[21:27:57] <Blondie101010> that could solve it, but I'm not set up to test it
[21:29:01] <sumthing1980> ok
[21:29:25] <sumthing1980> when I output filesize in every run in the loop
[21:29:34] <sumthing1980> it does show the new data eventually somehow
[21:29:49] <sumthing1980> but when I close the echos it doesnt
[21:29:51] <sumthing1980> weird
[21:31:23] <Blondie101010> because of what I said
[21:31:38] <da_wunder> most likely in first look where you do that `if ($fs!=$fs2){` the filesize is exact same
[21:32:15] <sumthing1980> okay it works differently in firefox

[21:32:21] <Blondie101010> sumthing1980:  not sure what your intention is, but it should probably be reworked
[21:32:59] <Blondie101010> the approach to get the new data is fine, but not to keep a web process listening on this

[21:34:22] <sumthing1980> ok weirdly it works it seems now
[21:34:39] <Blondie101010> it will probably depend on the output size
[21:34:59] <da_wunder> the I would just read that file once on each request <--> response and then make user to refresh that page to get new results OR do some simple ajax request to update that

[21:35:36] *** Quits: BadAdviceCat (~BadAdvice@user/badadvicecat) (Quit: Quitting)
[21:35:57] <sumthing1980> I was gonna use hidden iframe that writes to the main page for updates on log files
[21:36:16] <sumthing1980> but I can also use a iframe for each of the feed
[21:36:34] <sumthing1980> both will require something in the background that checks for file size change
[21:36:51] <da_wunder> personally I would just not use iframes - just use basic javascript and ajax request to fetch that data
[21:37:10] <da_wunder> you could make that like every X seconds really easily with javascript
[21:37:16] <sumthing1980> My skills with js is not very good
[21:37:31] <Blondie101010> well learn instead of wasting time on crap like this (honestly)
[21:37:33] <sumthing1980> not even sure the difference with iframe that writes <javascript>
[21:37:51] <da_wunder> then this should be some really good lesson you to start to learn
[21:37:56] <sumthing1980> i found it in my book that is called ajax
[21:38:19] <Blondie101010> sumthing1980:  the offset could be ketp in a session and the script called could simply return the change
[21:39:11] <Blondie101010> yes, that approach would use AJAX to get updates
[21:39:30] <Blondie101010> so make a script that just returns changes and stores the offset in the session
[21:39:33] <Blondie101010> that's it
[21:39:36] <Blondie101010> the rest is JS
[21:40:05] *** Parts: Nomikos (~nemo@about/web/climber) ()
[21:40:06] <sumthing1980> is hidden iframe that writes <javascript> lines that calls top.functiontoupdatemain(text) not ajax?
[21:40:23] <da_wunder> why do you need to use iframe?
[21:40:23] <Blondie101010> not sure what you're thinking about
[21:40:33] <da_wunder> basic javascript should be enough
[21:40:53] <sumthing1980> this is the most basic that I understand atm

[21:41:36] <Blondie101010> anyways, I told you the PHP part, but it does involve knowing JS and HTML
[21:42:06] <Blondie101010> you run a periodic AJAX query to that backend script and append it to the HTML element you want
[21:42:30] <sumthing1980> to update a livelog page that checks 100logs it still needs a script that checks 100 logs or instances of 100 scripts that checks one each
[21:43:00] <konrados> sumthing1980, some pseudocode for you (client side): https://paste.gg/p/anonymous/332a50c0b51a4c18b87a0566abf21c0d
[21:43:30] <konrados> Notice, that didn't follow the discussion, this is just my guess on what you want :)
[21:44:23] <da_wunder> so something like `setInterval(() => { // here you make your AJAX query and replace content of DOM of that request response }, 5000)` that is basic javascript to run some anonymous function every 5s, and in that anon function you make that ajax request eg. by using `fetch` - https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/03/introduction-to-fetch - and then if that request response is ok just replace your
[21:44:24] <sumthing1980> really not used to javascript
[21:44:29] <da_wunder> specified DOM content with that data
[21:44:48] <konrados> Instead of 'insert..' you might want to use textContent+=result.
[21:46:06] <Blondie101010> sumthing1980:  it seems to me that you're be overloading your webserver just to see logs conveniently, which sounds counter-productive

[21:53:10] <sumthing1980> https://controlc.com/e9fc62c9
[21:53:38] <sumthing1980> iframe is just for cosmetics, is this not ajax?
[21:55:13] <deltab> it's comet, as the server is pushing data
[21:55:30] <da_wunder> try to understand that you don't need that while loop there - you're making a request which returns a response - that response contains then information about that time - then you make next request and you get the information at time

[21:56:28] *** Joins: sumthing1980_ (~sumthing1@94.54.64.154)
[21:56:29] <sumthing1980> your ideas, do they not require a php script in the background that checks filesize change every n seconds?
[21:56:29] *** Quits: sumthing1980 (~sumthing1@94.54.64.154) (Remote host closed the connection)
[21:56:33] <deltab> da_wunder: it's sending a stream of data, updated every second
[21:56:56] <sumthing1980_> a normally it does not send data every second, only when the filesize changes
[21:57:02] <sumthing1980_> then it sends what is changed
[21:57:14] <sumthing1980_> but it requires an open http connection via iframe or whatnot
[21:57:20] <deltab> ah, right, checking every second, sending when it detects a change
[21:57:49] <sumthing1980_> does your solutions also not require something that checks every n seconds for a change?
[21:57:59] <deltab> yes, the iframe opens the continous connection, and the server sends a script each time it has something to display
[21:58:06] <sumthing1980_> Im gonna go with this atm
[21:58:32] <sumthing1980_> so a better ajax solution how will that require less processing power?
[21:58:58] <deltab> it's a technique I've used in the past, displays results from multiple suppliers as they arrive in realtime
[21:59:21] <Blondie101010> sumthing1980_:  I already gave you the solution for the pHP side
[21:59:35] <Blondie101010> you just get the change and update the size in the session!  that's it!!!
[21:59:49] <deltab> using ajax as da_wunder describes would require more processing, as there'd be a separate request each time the client checks for an update
[22:00:59] <Blondie101010> you mean to group them in the response?
[22:01:05] <da_wunder> but in the other hand it's a lot of simplier solution - imho - and really that code doesn't seem to be so hard to process so performance improvements might be just really small
[22:01:33] <Blondie101010> if there's a hundred log files, grouping them would make sense
[22:01:34] <konrados> deltab, but the browser finally will say "timeout", won't it?
[22:02:20] <Blondie101010> long running requests always have a time limit
[22:02:23] <deltab> konrados: only if it stops receiving data. A periodic 'heartbeaat' output can prevent that
[22:02:37] <konrados> ah, ok, didn't know, thanks :)
[22:02:59] <Blondie101010> but it would have the same problem as they had initially if there's almost nothing
[22:03:15] <konrados> Blondie101010, yeah, that's what I thought, didn't even try to beat it :)
[22:03:20] <Blondie101010> I'd do my simple solution but for all logs in one shot
[22:03:54] <deltab> if it does timeout, or disconnect for some other reason, you can detect that and send another request
[22:04:21] <sumthing1980_> disconnect is not so important at the moment it will be me whos using it
[22:04:22] <Blondie101010> I can't see why someone would consider that approach today, unlike 15 years ago
[22:04:42] <sumthing1980_> iframe?
[22:04:43] <deltab> yeah, today we have websockets
[22:04:52] <deltab> I was using that 15 years ago or so
[22:04:58] <sumthing1980_> because Im stuck in 1994 :)
[22:05:11] <Blondie101010> sumthing1980_:  just learn JS, and do the PHP script like I said
[22:05:30] <Blondie101010> http://mylogserver/getlogupdates.php
[22:05:51] <deltab> my php script opened a tcp connection to a mainframe, read a line at a time as they came in, and wrote script elements to the vrowser
[22:05:53] <Blondie101010> and that returns the various updates in a single JSON, and sets the proper cursors in $_SESSION
[22:06:29] <Blondie101010> the rest is elementary JS
[22:07:00] <sumthing1980_> Ill learn some more js
[22:07:17] <sumthing1980_> thanks for the help
[22:07:39] <sumthing1980_> so my code it is ajax right?
[22:07:45] <deltab> comet
[22:08:02] <sumthing1980_> comet?
[22:08:31] <deltab> related to ajax, but a continuous connection is kept open and the server sends data whenever it wants
[22:09:08] <sumthing1980_> isnt the other ajax methods also doing this but the browser does it hidden?
[22:09:27] <deltab> in ajax, the client sends a request and gets a near-immediate response, and the connection is closed (or goes into a keep-alive state)
[22:10:11] <sumthing1980_> it should still have a http connection to someplace for updates but hidden instead of iframe
[22:10:24] <sumthing1980_> but you need a connection open to get updates
[22:10:36] <deltab> the iframe can be hidden
[22:10:49] <Blondie101010> yes but that's not even the point
[22:11:05] <Blondie101010> sumthing1980_:  ajax queries don't show up in your browser window, they do their stuff
[22:11:10] <deltab> and there are several ways to implement both ajax and comet
[22:11:12] <konrados> sumthing1980_ with ajax you usually make a new connection every single time (request).
[22:11:34] <deltab> the modern ways are fetch and websockets respectively
[22:11:52] <da_wunder> ^
[22:12:01] <Blondie101010> websockets would be overkill, especially to someone having problems with AJAX
[22:12:21] <sumthing1980_> mmkay
[22:12:21] <sumthing1980_> ok
[22:12:21] <sumthing1980_> Ill get back to work
[22:12:21] <sumthing1980_> thanks evryone

[22:12:27] <da_wunder> but if you haven't done those - I really recommend you to start with basic ajax request first - just to learn the basics and after that move to websockets
[22:12:46] <Blondie101010> websockets would involve having a server
[22:12:55] <deltab> gah I had a solution for the stat thing
[22:13:25] <Blondie101010> you mean the problem I solved an hour ago?
[22:14:01] <Blondie101010> !+clearstatcache
[22:14:01] <php-bot> void clearstatcache(void)  - Clear file stat cache - http://php.net/clearstatcache
[22:14:44] <deltab> using fstat avoids the cache
[22:15:06] <Blondie101010> that would have been a very suitable solution

[22:45:59] <deltab> konrados: oh, there is an execution time limit on PHP scripts started by a web server; that can be lifted, or the script can be started from the command line with its own web server so that it's not subject to that
[22:46:22] <Rockwood> konrados, o/
[22:47:12] <konrados> deltab,  Yeah, but I wasn't following the whole conversation and I'm not sure why should we do it that way, instead of simple ajax requests, but maybe sumthing1980 has his reasons.
[22:47:58] <konrados> I've just personally never done it that way (I did long pooling a few times but also didn't like it :))
[22:48:41] <Blondie101010> I've done long polling AJAX and that was neat, but retarded in today's mindset
[22:48:43] <konrados> I remember I did websockets once, but it was 6 years ago and can't say anything about that.
[22:48:50] <konrados> yeah :)
[22:49:15] <Blondie101010> long polling ajax doesn't have the problems he encountered because it's structured
[22:49:37] <Rockwood> fetch now days for ajax
[22:49:54] <Blondie101010> expecting the browser to just show the few bytes that just came in is not a good expectation
[22:50:41] <konrados> Right
[22:51:48] <AllenJB> moving mobile and terrible wifi connections will play havoc with long polling too.
[22:55:22] <konrados> Yeah, I think that was my problem, I just can't remember :)

[23:28:39] <no_gravity> Naktibalda: Let me check that one ...
[23:28:39] <TinoDidriksen> It can still be systemd or selinux blocking the server.

[23:29:26] <Blondie101010> did you check that it is?  ss -tunlp|grep :32031
[23:29:44] <Na_Klar> I wrote it to listen to 32031

[23:32:43] <no_gravity> Naktibalda: \P{L} would kill many chars users use in their values. Like "," and "-".
[23:32:52] <Blondie101010> ok, does it connect if you try: nc localhost 32031
[23:33:27] <Na_Klar> ive got no "nc" command and apt doesnt know it.
[23:33:29] <no_gravity> Naktibalda: They make fields like "supported_materials" and values like "stone, silver and even gold!!" :)
[23:33:51] <Blondie101010> Na_Klar:  you should ask for your sysadmin's assistance, but try telnet or learning to use Google

[23:35:11] <no_gravity> Naktibalda: How do you mean? How do you define "whitespace"?
[23:35:28] <Blondie101010> \s
[23:35:30] <no_gravity> Naktibalda: Ah! No, I replace multiple whitespaces with a single whitespace.
[23:36:06] <Na_Klar> Blondie101010: telnet does not get a vonnection. hangs on trying 127.0.0.1...
[23:36:15] <Blondie101010> then look at the firewall
[23:36:36] <Na_Klar> ok, iptables i guess
[23:36:40] <Blondie101010> if you put the proper command
[23:36:42] <Naktibalda> so you want to permit punctuation too, though that left to right character is punctuation too, so maybe you want to be a bit more specific

[23:37:55] <no_gravity> Naktibalda: I grepped through about 500k attribute values. Not a single legit use of the left-to-right chart. But a bunch of mistakes.
[23:38:02] <Naktibalda> no_gravity: that symbol was visible in your code
[23:38:11] <no_gravity> Naktibalda: Which symbol?
[23:38:16] <Blondie101010> the red symbol
[23:38:23] <Blondie101010> so it's not something they can't see!
[23:38:29] <Naktibalda> https://3v4l.org/jKKP8
[23:38:30] <Na_Klar> Blondie101010: yep. iptables has no restrictions. In Fwd Out, all accept.
[23:38:51] <Blondie101010> Na_Klar:  then ask your sysadmin
[23:39:07] <Na_Klar> yes, thank you very much
[23:39:21] <no_gravity> Blondie101010, Naktibalda: If I colorize those chars for my users, they will get even more confused. "I pasted 'iron' - why do I see 'iron*'?"

[23:41:34] <Blondie101010> I told you it could be called "netcat"
[23:41:42] <Blondie101010> but so far you said nothing on topic
[23:41:50] <Na_Klar> you did? .. then my bad
[23:41:52] <Blondie101010> come back when you have a PHP question
[23:42:43] <Na_Klar> I was here long before you ;) you are not the genration of ##php users I was used to an appreciated. thx nevertheless for trying.
[23:43:20] <Blondie101010> maybe... not trying to appear as better, but I respect the channel topics
[23:43:29] <Blondie101010> otherwise there would be ONLY one channel
[23:44:46] <Blondie101010> and though you saw nothing in your iptables command, the problem does appear to be with the firewall or something blocking at the kernel level, so you may want to check logs
[23:46:05] <Blondie101010> Na_Klar:  there is one important side note:  if the issue had been present on all systems, it could have been a bug in your code
[23:47:34] <Blondie101010> traces in the server process should clarify those
