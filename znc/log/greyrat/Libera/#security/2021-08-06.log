[00:00:27] <forgotmynick> putting aside the potential security risks of cia and russian mafia finding my dad joke memes, there are 2 devices i use on a regular basis. a desktop and a laptop. neither have a fingerprint sensor, however, i purchased a logitech brio 4k camera which has windows hi built in and i have 2 usb fingerprint sensors from kensington (1 plugged into each device) but (as expected) i have to register both devices for it to work on
[00:00:27] <forgotmynick> whichever website. i cannot plug one device into the other machine, it doesn't recognise fingerprints (even when touching with the same finger at the exact same angle). i don't know if the fingerprints are stored on the device and/or the computer. if it's on device, then why does it not work on another machine? perhaps there is some counter data stored on the machine to decrypt the data maybe? if so i would like to know if
[00:00:28] <forgotmynick> there's a way to copy that data. if it's on the computer, can i not just sync the data? i'm assuming not because it's going to be somehow tied to the physical device. security is nice, i get it. but is there a way to have some type of software based thing which creates a fake hardware device which then links to something else for authentication?

[05:19:47] <ajak> why?
[05:21:21] <BitLocker> ajak, because BitLocker is vulnerable otherwise
[05:22:01] <ajak> bitlocker is vulnerable if the chassis is opened?
[05:22:26] <BitLocker> MIT researchers were able to recover the encryption key from the RAM.  The OS protects it, but if you move the RAM to another system you can read it. And while unplugging the RAM would make it lose its memory too fast at room temperature, with enough liquid nitrogen, RAM holds its contents for several seconds without power

[05:26:21] <ajak> so you need to just halt the system, then?
[05:27:36] <BitLocker> once you are inside the case, you can tamper with the chassis intrusion sensor.  If the TPM isn't cleared and you don't do anything to upset the TPM, you can boot the system back up and the key will be loaded into RAM again
[05:27:51] <BitLocker> assuming it didn't get cleared
[05:28:47] <ajak> have you considered not allowing other people to access the system while it's on?

[05:55:42] <BitLocker> The Windows 11 system "requirements" are designed to put computers far, far newer than this (a few as recent as 2018) into landfills so new ones can be produced.  I hope they don't enforce the "requirements" better in the final release, but I am sure they will.  And as for newer CPU's being "secure" - Spectre is hard to exploit even before software mitigations, and at least you can get old CPU's without the Intel ME which is a backdoor

[06:03:52] <BitLocker> My boss and I don't like issuing touch screens.  They cause people to use the laptops in ways that get them dropped, and when they get dropped (whether it happened because of that or not), the new screen costs more.  Sometimes you have to replace the whole lid

[08:41:30] <mats1> i know things too, maan
[08:44:31] <sartan> Haha! so the last time I used audacity was quite a few years ago. At a larger enterprise I was running the phone system (about 1000 phones) on cisco call manager.
[08:44:56] <sartan> we were migrating off some older analog nortel phone system, and there was a lot of feedback from the user base for how they wanted things to operate.
[08:45:19] <sartan> had the default cisco on-hold music, and some senior staff complained it sounded literally like porn music wh ile their clients were on hold. fair request, so i just turned off the on-hold music
[08:45:40] <sartan> unfortunately dead-silence made everyone think calls were getting disconnected, so i had to get creative
[08:46:00] <sartan> i tried to use audacities' white noise generator to make the most slight background hiss, as analog systems tended to make but i could never figure out it right
[08:46:34] <sartan> at the end of the day I breathed into a mic like 'haaaaaaa' really slowly and tuned the audio in a loop. i couldn't find a good 'background noise' wav file or whatever on the internet
[08:46:45] <CoJaBo> sartan: One of our hold loops, used without issue for nearly 2 decades, has the title "Porno Music #3" in the metadata
[08:46:50] <sartan> the guy that's still there today 10 years later tells me they're still using it for Music on Hold. My vocal hiss

[08:51:44] <BitLocker> Chromium is way out of line lately.  "Experiments" should be opt-in.  This latest CECPQ2 "experiment" that was randomly applied for every website that starts with "a" is obnoxiously disruptive to enterprise environments doing packet inspection.  Requires being turned off with a group policy (and said policy's description threatens to remove the option in a future release, doesn't say how long).  Does NOT take the common-sense approach they took with
[08:51:44] <BitLocker> their HSTS and key pinning - those features recognize that when you've imported your own trusted root and certs are chained back to that private root, you're doing inspection and they should leave it be.  Not so with their post-quantum experiment.  If your firewall is a couple years old and doesn't do post-quantum, fuck you, I guess.

[09:00:49] <BitLocker> CoJaBo, Chrome is trying to use experimental post-quantum CECPQ2 algorithms with TLS1.3 for sites beginning with "a".  It's an experiment rolled out in Chrome 92.
[09:01:18] <BitLocker> Our FortiGate doesn't like it
[09:01:29] <BitLocker> neither do most enterprise NGFW's from what I'm hearing
[09:01:55] <CoJaBo> BitLocker: That's your problem, you should be using all-Google hardware
[09:02:01] <BitLocker> lol
[09:03:06] <BitLocker> with the threat to eventually remove the option and force it being in the description of the group policy option that currently disables it - I'm thinking the Chromium project has lost site of who the admins are of companies' networks.  They seem to think it's them.
[09:03:30] <BitLocker> And I think Firefox sounds better and better the longer I contemplate that thought
[09:04:43] <BitLocker> not that CECPQ2 won't eventually be important - but come on, that's an arbitrary and ridiculous and poorly announced experiment to pull on the general public, let alone enterprises (doesn't auto-exempt certs that chain back to private root CA's like the HSTS pins did)

[18:43:45] <ProteinEncoder> I knew it
[18:43:53] <ProteinEncoder> I need at least 10 chained tor routers just as a baseline
[18:44:17] <ajak> but, we've heard all this before, why do you keep coming back?
[18:44:24] <euouae> You need the entire tor network
[18:44:24] <ajak> and probably keep getting told the same things

[18:46:39] <MadCamel> my perspective is that vpn providers lie. If a government agency tells them to track a user or their entire company will be shut down they will track the user. It's trivial. So I wouldn't rely on that for any type of true anonymity.
[18:46:45] *** Joins: oxum (~oxum@106.203.207.2)
[18:47:07] <euouae> Which government agency ?
[18:47:08] <ajak> the tor project recommends not using tor and vpns at the same time anyway
[18:47:22] <ajak> and, the tor project also says more hops != more anonymity

[18:49:33] <ProteinEncoder> Mad
[18:49:38] <ProteinEncoder> The thing about VPNS and governments
[18:49:39] <ajak> seriously, i don't know why you'd spend time doing this strange complex decahop setup rather than just.. reading the tor project's documentation on such things?
[18:50:00] <ProteinEncoder> Is VPN companies in certain controies only have to listen to some governments
[18:50:15] <ProteinEncoder> for example, does a Russian VPN company have to listen to a USA govenrment order?
[18:50:16] <ProteinEncoder> Probably not
[18:50:33] <ProteinEncoder> So if you use VPN companies located over-seas, they are more legally resiliant to government wiretap orders
[18:50:47] <ProteinEncoder> I just like to go beyond what most people consider normal
[18:50:48] <euouae> You idiot
[18:50:50] <ProteinEncoder> Why?
[18:50:56] <MadCamel> beware though. There are companies that offer de-anonymizing service to governments. They purchase netflow data from large internet providers and Tier1s. They analyze the data and can de-anon many vpns and can also de-anon tor if you're not careful.
[18:51:01] <euouae> you would live in the us and get a Russian vpn?
[18:51:08] <ProteinEncoder> yes
[18:51:12] <ProteinEncoder> hey purchase netflow data from large internet providers and Tier1s. They analyze the data and can de-anon many vpns and can also de-anon tor if you're not careful.
[18:51:15] <euouae> that’s idiotic
[18:51:17] <ProteinEncoder> Yes this is what I was afraid of
[18:51:21] <ProteinEncoder> Mass-scale network analysis
[18:51:27] <ProteinEncoder> End to end traffic analysis
[18:51:27] <MadCamel> Yup it's happening.
[18:51:34] <ProteinEncoder> Whats the solution
[18:51:40] <MadCamel> ham radio :)
[18:51:41] <shlomif> ProteinEncoder: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnFr-DOPf8
[18:51:53] <euouae> There’s no solution other than not using the internet
[18:51:57] <ProteinEncoder> use so many tor cirucits/mixnets that they cant easily see whos sending data?
[18:52:02] <ProteinEncoder> Encrypted Ham Radio
[18:52:05] <euouae> or using niche protocols

[18:52:24] <ProteinEncoder> Yeah I have a feeling Tor is secure to everyone but the government

[19:42:15] <mats1> its nice the code is available but its also basically unreadable

[19:46:18] <MadCamel> open source is great because if I want to do something I can do it. Bug bothering me? Fix it myself. Want a new feature? Add it myself. I've done similar things on closed-source systems but spending 60 hours in IDA figuring out something that'd take 2 minutes if I had the source really sucks.

[19:47:40] <mats1> theres no substitute for tradecraft
[19:48:23] <mats1> software like signal and tor made for chumps are not substitutes
[19:49:55] <piou> Heartbleed is many things, but it's a bug that was found by people reading the code. If anything it's a prime example of bug in a complex software that was found by the many eyes. It's thought to have been lying arround for a long time but it was only two years. Certainly two years aren't a laughing matter but as far as bugs go it's relatively tame. Many bugs go a full decade without being found,
[19:50:01] <piou> including vulnerabilities, because finding bugs is always hard and there's no surefire way to avoid it. So heartbleed, for all the flaws it highlights, doesn't in my opinion make the case that peer review is a failure.
[19:50:41] <mats1> open source is fundamentally an economic surplus phenomenon
[19:50:44] <piou> It does make the case that openssl is a hot mess though, that I wholeheartedly agree

[23:19:30] <Hash> Ok
[23:19:35] <Hash> I'm pissed a bit
[23:19:38] <Hash> Your company implements a new policy that all computers must use drive-level encryption for security. You want to enhance the security provided by BitLocker. What should you enable?
[23:19:49] <Hash> NTFS, BIOS pw, TPM, EFS
[23:20:05] <Hash> I picked NTFS as I know to enable bitlocker, you need NTFS, otherwise it won't even turn on.

[23:32:31] <Minall> Like too much knowledge?
[23:35:36] <be3uykpy> with OIDC, can you login from the IDP side as well? SP logins works fine, but does the protocol also allow to connect from the IDP like in SAML? e.g user click the app icon on his IDP (say AzureAD) and it logs him into the application (service provider) directly?
