[00:29:33] <adfeno> I'm generally more in favor of IceCast type of presentation, but the problem here in Brazil is infrastructure to run any self-hosted service.
[00:30:05] <adfeno> For example, in domestic use, you can do that as long as you don't fall into CGNAT
[00:30:23] <psymin> Icecast is nice
[00:30:48] <adfeno> Also, IceCast is way lighter for the X2xx and X4xx
[00:30:55] <adfeno> ggoes: ^
[00:31:50] <jxself> The Incompatible Timesharing System's even lighter. :)

[20:54:31] <Noisytoot> Hello
[20:54:58] <donald> panosalevro: the main thing for updating is to make sure the existing info is current (download still works, website is still there)
[20:55:20] <donald> panosalevro: but any other information you find about the project that can fit into one of those fields is good to add
[20:55:42] <donald> panosalevro: often when people add entries to the Directory, they're focused on the reveiwing part, so only the basic info gets added
[20:56:03] <donald> panosalevro: but with updates we can fill in more details, to make the entry more complete and up to date

[21:17:30] <donald> actually i guess it's an 'i' circled, not a question mark
[21:17:49] <panosalevro> it says Copyright (with year of validity) of the software. Should be at the top of the COPYING file.
[21:17:55] <donald> hm, though it's suggestion that the copyright year is usually at the top isn't true
[21:18:02] <donald> should maybe say 'sometimes' at the top
[21:18:08] <bone-baboon> donald: Yes twice before.
[21:18:18] <donald> bone-baboon: great! welcome back
[21:18:22] <bone-baboon> The conversation about the Rust Trademark policy issue was happening on several mailing lists and in different IRC channels.  I decided to write a summary.  The summary is located at <https://bonebaboon.tilde.site/rust-trademark-policy-issue/>.  The summaries Git repository can be cloned with `git clone https://bonebaboon.tilde.site/git/rust-trademark-policy-issue.git`.  I also plan to have a static website up so that the Git repository
[21:18:23] <bone-baboon> can be browsed online and that will be located at <https://bonebaboon.tilde.site/git-browse/rust-trademark-policy-issue/>.
[21:18:41] <donald> ah that's you, nice
[21:19:07] <donald> panosalevro: you'll more often find the copyright year at the top of source files, though even then sometimes they leave it off lol
[21:20:37] <panosalevro> fortunately they state it on their website

[21:38:34] <bone-baboon> During last weeks FSD meeting I looked into FIGlet.  This <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/guix-devel/2021-06/msg00092.html> has attached the message I sent to the FIGlet email.  It is mainly about files in the FIGlet repository that have missing license information or license information that does not appear to match what LICENSE says. If the FIGlet project does not improve the license headers of the source files that have problems
[21:38:34] <bone-baboon> then what impact would that have on FIGlet being free software and being in FSDG distributions?
[21:38:58] <Noisytoot> Can software that has not had any releases yet be added to the FSD (like https://github.com/solanum-ircd/solanum)?

[21:51:02] <bone-baboon> donald: I did an informed spot check based on <https://wiki.debian.org/NonFreeTrackingSystem/SourcePackage/figlet>. In the most recent FIGlet repository <ftp://ftp.figlet.org/pub/figlet/program/unix/figlet-2.2.5.tar.gz> these files appeared to be more restrictive: figfont.txt, figlet.6 and many of the files with .flf extension in the fonts directory.

[22:31:32] <bone-baboon> kitty a terminal emulator has telemetry on by default and kitty's lead developer has said he is going to keep it that way. <https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/pull/3544> Would the telemetry be good to add to a kitty fsd listing as an anti feature?
[22:31:55] <panosalevro> bone-baboon: ah nice. i only checked rxvt
[22:33:14] <donald> bone-baboon: if something has an anti-feature maybe it's just better to focus on adding something else?
[22:34:07] <oaken-source> everyone should just write their own terminal emulator. it's en excellent exercise
[22:34:26] <bone-baboon> donald: That makes sense. Would on by default telemetry be an anti feature in regards to the FSD?
[22:36:09] *** Joins: nosolls (~user@69-174-156-126.symrinaa.metronetinc.net)
[22:37:06] <lts> Ah, the name and behaviour seemed familiar. I did not know the same developer was behind kitty and calibre.
[22:37:31] <donald> bone-baboon: maybe, it looks like the explanation on tracking might apply https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Free_Software_Directory:Antifeatures
[22:37:45] <tpefreedom> oaken-source: What programming language?
[22:37:47] <panosalevro> i noticed mastodon is in the FSD, but other fediverse projects are not. should they be included?
[22:37:57] <bone-baboon> donald: Thanks
[22:38:56] <donald> from the issue, is it telemetry or just automatic updates?
[22:39:39] <tpefreedom> donald: Should the FSD include free/libre gtk/qt/(I guess fltk and tk too) themes, or should we leave those out?
[22:40:50] *** beaver is now known as pong
[22:40:59] <lts> Automatic updates is usually a call home feature
[22:42:16] <tpefreedom> Couldn't you just configure automatic updates in your package manager?
[22:42:50] <bone-baboon> donald: It is not clear that there is no other telemetry beyond the update telemetry. Give the lead developers view of on by default telemetry it would not surprise me if there was other telemetry in kitty.
[22:46:18] <donald> tpefreedom: i'm not familiar with how those themes work
[22:46:36] *** Quits: TheCreeper (~TheCreepe@user/thecreeper) (Quit: Leaving)
[22:47:23] <donald> lts: bone-baboon understood, but yeah maybe just focus on adding other stuff for now, there's a whole universe of free software still missing from the directory
[22:48:26] <bone-baboon> donald: Okay
[22:49:46] <panosalevro> tpefreedom: are you referring to user-created themes? i dont think these can be regarded as software, ive only seen CC licenses on them
[22:50:32] <tpefreedom> panosalevro, I wasn't fully sure how those worked behind the scenes.
[22:50:35] <tpefreedom> hmm
[22:50:37] <penguino> gtk themes are written in css
[22:51:18] <tpefreedom> I had the idea that the upgrade from windows campaign could help point new gnu/linux users towards DEs/themes that would be more familiar.
[22:51:30] <panosalevro> penguino: correct
[22:51:35] <tpefreedom> IN addition to just convincing them to upgade
[22:52:44] <penguino> panosalevro: the materia gtk theme is licensed under the gplv2, so i think it can be considered software: https://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme
[22:54:15] <panosalevro> penguino: some people use GPL and other software licenses on material that is used for software, but is not software per se
[22:54:29] <donald> panosalevro: right, the license doesn't determine whether it's actually software
[22:54:46] <donald> but maybe this is something to discuss on the mailing list, it seems like a policy question
