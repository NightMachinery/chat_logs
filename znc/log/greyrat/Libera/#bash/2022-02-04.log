[00:52:24] <greycat> you can't retroactively add timestamps to an existing log file
[00:52:27] <phogg> using bind -x can I accept an input char the way e.g. character-search does? Or do I need to use read from within the function?

[00:59:22] <mrcoffee> Also how do i pipe a text file to the stamper script i just copy/pasted ?
[00:59:32] <greycat> tirnanog: so you're saying he wanted to add zero-padded *line numbers* to a text file?  Nothing to do with time?

[00:59:45] <tirnanog> greycat: that's how I'm reading it. maybe for pacing topics of discussion or whatever.
[00:59:57] <mrcoffee> At the start of each line i need: 000010
[00:59:57] <greycat> mrcoffee: if you aren't writing time-stamped log entries to a log file, then my initial answer is not useful to you
[01:00:01] <mrcoffee> 0000020
[01:00:04] <tirnanog> yes yes.
[01:00:10] <mrcoffee> 000100
[01:00:14] <mrcoffee> 0000110
[01:00:15] <phogg> hmm, read from inside a function run from bind -x seems to blank the input line while waiting on input. That's weird.
[01:00:23] <tirnanog> if you want to pipe to it, remove "infile" (which otherwise specifies the file to act upon).
[01:00:39] <tirnanog> also, I have no idea what this stamper script is that you keep saying that you copied and pasted.

[01:02:05] <greycat> if you want a 6-digit line number that goes 10, 20, 30... you could also use awk '{printf("%06d:%s\n", NR*10, $0)}'
[01:02:34] <tirnanog> by a happpy conicidence, nl defaults the width to 6.
[01:02:34] <greycat> which is easier than looking up the options of nl(1) if you've never used it in the last 25 years

[01:11:55] <greycat> Well, the good news is that awk officially beats nl now.
[01:12:39] <greycat> And OTHER mathematical changes we need to know about?  Does it change AGAIN after a certain number of "minutes"?

[01:18:50] <mrcoffee> How do i pipe the text file to it?
[01:18:59] <tirnanog> you figured out how to pipe to the last one. what's different this time?
[01:19:05] <greycat> I have *so many issues* with this question.  Like, if the numeric prefixes in this "meta file" are supposed to represent MOMENTS IN TIME to a player, how in the fuck does he know that each moment is 10 seconds later than the previous line?
[01:19:18] <mrcoffee> Ah ok, let me try..
[01:20:17] <tirnanog> replace printf with the thing that produces the stream.
[01:20:32] <mrcoffee> Mmm the nl command i just appended the file name at the end..
[01:20:46] <greycat> does the nl command do what you want?
[01:20:51] <tirnanog> oh, I know what he means.
[01:21:03] <mrcoffee> Actually no, you had specified infile outfile
[01:21:14] <tirnanog> let me just spell it out then.
[01:21:45] <tirnanog> where is the input coming from? a file or the standard output of some other command?
[01:21:48] <greycat> (It was a rhetorical question.  The nl command doesn't do what you want, because it isn't operating in modified base 60.  So it's pointless.  So stop comparing it to anything.)

[03:46:19] <greycat> Makes me leery of engaging in any kind of serious discussion about option processing.
[03:46:22] <armin> e36freak: if you 100% understand that tool, sure, i don't.
[03:46:27] <kurahaupo_> armin: Back references are sometimes useful, but they can have a terrible effect on regex performance, in effect turning a regular expression into an irregular one. So avoid backrefs unless actually necessary, and preferably also take steps to guarantee that the input has only limited size (eg "cut -c1-500" to truncate lines longer than 500 bytes)
[03:46:33] <e36freak> armin: that's not the tool's fault
[03:46:51] <e36freak> greycat: i know a good therapist
[03:47:00] <armin> e36freak: of course it's not, the question here was if there is an actual benefit in using them...

[03:47:14] <e36freak> armin: and i just told you the main benefit

[03:53:19] <llua> kurahaupo_: "can i please just say that using getopt/getopts in favor of just parsing arguments with a simple case construct seems so insanely unnecessary to me!?" kicked this discussion off
[03:54:17] <e36freak> greycat: when i've done it i just wrote a loop that breaks it into -c -v -f myfile, in your case, and then do the usual while loop/case afterward
[03:54:26] <kurahaupo_> llua: Personally I agree with that sentiment. getopts' value-add is negligible and makes it harder to implement long options
[03:54:34] <e36freak> loop takes the same cvf: style option string as getopts
[03:55:04] <e36freak> it's not a huge deal, but it's still easier to use getopts. i did it because i wanted more stuff than getopts provides (namely long options with optional arguments)

[04:19:16] <armin> that's absolutely correct, but isn't supporting that debatable? there simply isn't an option called "cvfmyfile"...
[04:19:42] <greycat> "I won't support that" is a perfectly acceptable answer.
[04:19:47] <e36freak> ^
[04:19:53] <armin> i'm not saying that's the "correct" way to interprete this, but a lot of applications do it like that.
[04:20:06] <e36freak> however, it's also extremely commonly supported to the point that it's pretty much expected
[04:20:08] <armin> fair point. :D

[04:24:23] <e36freak> a lot of people like to stick to convention and what is commonly supported so as not to have any surprises to the user
[04:24:39] <e36freak> and getopts makes supporting that particular feature a bit easier than not, which is again why it exists
[04:24:57] <armin> hm, well, i like to throw error messages if the parsed options don't make sense.

[04:26:06] <e36freak> i don't think dd will change just because its option style makes sense for dd
[04:26:09] <kurahaupo> My typical option parsing looks roughly like: for((;$#;)) do case $1 in -[abc]) flag[${1:1}]=true ;; -[abc]*) set X "${1::2}" "-${1:2}" "${@:2}" ;; -[def]) opt[${1:1}]=$2 ; shift ;; -[def]*) set X "${1::2}" "${1:2}" "${@:2}" ;; -[g]) opt[${1:1:1}]=${1:2} ;; -*) usage ; exit ; esac ; shift ; done # This is actually harder using getopts, since it won't let -g have an optional or empty arg

[17:00:38] <jose1711> exp. of word is substituted vs assigned to parameter
[17:00:45] <jose1711> to me they both work the same
[17:00:56] <tirnanog> no. one involves a variable assignment.
[17:01:23] <tirnanog> # foo=; echo "${foo:-bar}"; declare -p foo

[17:01:43] <jose1711> ahh.. so one sets foo
[17:01:46] <tirnanog> yep.
[17:01:58] <jose1711> i can see it now. thank you
[17:02:03] <tirnanog> that's the parameter being assigned to.
[17:02:16] <tirnanog> in addition to the expansion itself.
[17:03:29] <tirnanog> still, the assignment and/or substitution will only occur if unset/empty. or just unset if the colon is removed.
[17:03:47] <tirnanog> the rules don't change in that regard.

[17:43:39] <Bayes> code feedback: is this a reasonable way to break a long literal for my .bashrc? http://ix.io/3OD0
[17:44:49] <emanuele6> unnecessary conf variable
[17:45:07] <Bayes> can you break it up directly on the export call ?
[17:45:19] <emanuele6> also that $XDG_CONFIG_HOME doesn't look very safe
[17:45:26] <emanuele6> Bayes: export is a flag.
[17:45:41] <emanuele6> you can just run `export ASPELL_CONF' to set it
[17:45:54] <emanuele6> you can do it after or before the assignment, it doesn't matter
[17:46:17] <emanuele6> s/flag/attribute/
[17:46:58] <Soliton> you can end lines with a backslash to merge them into the next one.
[17:46:58] <emanuele6> you don't need to "call export" to save the change in the environment
[17:47:14] <Bayes> hm lemme try something different
[17:47:27] <emanuele6> `export'-ed variables will be exported, other variables will not be exported
[17:48:02] <tirnanog> incidentally, newlines would work fine.
[17:48:46] <Bayes> Soliton http://ix.io/3OD3 this what you mean?
[17:48:47] <emanuele6> you could also   printf -v ASPELL_CONF %s \ part1 \ part2 \ part3
[17:48:53] <emanuele6> still that injection is not safe.
[17:49:07] <emanuele6> Bayes: no, of course not
[17:49:09] <Soliton> Bayes: no.
[17:49:10] <Bayes> emanuele6 just in case, since this goes in my .bashrc I understand I need to export it ?
[17:49:25] <Soliton> you added spaces so it's several words now.
[17:49:28] *** Quits: skapata (~Skapata@user/skapata) (Remote host closed the connection)
[17:49:34] <Bayes> oh of course
[17:50:21] <emanuele6> is that injection even required?
[17:50:25] <emanuele6> that looks like shell code
[17:50:40] <emanuele6> can't the shell code just look up $XDG_CONFIG_HOME? do you really have to inject it?
[17:51:52] <Bayes> that's how aspell works, it doesn't look up for xdg vars but ASPELL_CONF so I need to set ASPELL_CONF by han
[17:51:54] <Bayes> hand*
[17:51:54] <tirnanog> it's not shell code.
[17:52:02] <Bayes> yeah this is my .bashrc
[17:52:14] <Bayes> tirnanog what do you mean that newlines would work fine?
[17:52:20] <tirnanog> foo="bar
[17:52:22] <tirnanog> baz"
[17:52:24] <tirnanog> is legal, for example.

[19:03:26] <Friithian> uh, gnu parallel does exactly that. So you want each instance of python scrip tto get multiple lines from stdin or what?
[19:03:36] <dirtwash> Friithian: yes
[19:04:05] <Friithian> ok, so you have a list of 100 lines, how many lines should each worker get?

[19:11:50] <dirtwash> I think I am trying to solve the wrong problem. The underlying issue is unrelated. The bottleneck I have is with redis, I reckon I can just have multiple redis connections at once instead of having multiple processes doing one
[19:12:19] *** Quits: mrcoffee (~mago@user/mago) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[19:12:57] <Soliton> and redis will work faster if you give it multiple tasks in parallel?
[19:14:17] <dirtwash> It's pretty idle, the bottleneck is the back and forth with the tcp and checks. It has to check if a key exists, if not set the key-value and a ttl. for each entry. It now does that by looping over the list. If I can just parallelize that it'll be faster. like 3 at once would already solve my issue

[19:18:22] <k8yun> is that -r and -m separated, and the only reason why -rm and -d are separated is -d requires argument?

[19:46:09] <Soliton> in the latter case the env variable is only set for that command.
[19:47:18] <LambdaComplex> i'm currently working on a program, and the latter works. the former does not. does that mean the code is only looking at its own environment, and not reading anything from its parent's environment?
[19:47:52] <Soliton> the environment is inherited by child processes.
[19:48:02] <phy1729> Did you export SOME_ENV_VAR in the first case?
