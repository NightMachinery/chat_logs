[11:11:28] <teegee> so my git repo is 7 commits ahead or the origin. Is there any way to only push 4 of those commits?
[11:11:33] *** Joins: Booster2ooo (~Booster2o@user/booster2ooo)
[11:11:52] <teegee> without doing a reset and re-committing
[11:12:34] <jmer> teegee: check out the commit you want, create a new branch and push that?
[11:13:00] <teegee> hm.. yeah I guess that can work
[11:13:09] <jmer> I am not sure it's the "best way"
[11:13:21] <jmer> there's probably some obscure git command specifically for this situation xD
[11:13:38] <biberu> teegee: iirc: git push origin abcdef:branch
[11:14:00] <biberu> where origin is your remote, abcdef is the latest commit you want to push, and branch is the name of your cat
[11:14:03] <jmer> abcdef is the commit id?
[11:14:12] <jmer> oh.. I should've just waited
[11:16:28] <biberu> https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push#Documentation/git-push.txt-ltrefspecgt82308203
[11:20:52] <jmer> biberu: I've been looking for five minutes, I still haven't been able to find the place in the docs explaining your example >.<
[11:21:18] <biberu> The format of a <refspec> parameter is an optional plus +, followed by the source object <src>, followed by a colon :, followed by the destination ref <dst>.
[11:21:21] <biberu> The <src> is often the name of the branch you would want to push, but it can be any arbitrary "SHA-1 expression", such as master~4 or HEAD (see gitrevisions[7]).
[11:21:52] <jmer> is there a nice guide to git jargon?
[11:21:59] <biberu> se e.g. master~4, that refers to a commit 4 steps from master, i'm just replacing it with the id
[11:22:07] <jmer> I think that's why I often struggle with the official docs and have to resort to more... friendly blogs/examples/posts
[11:22:44] <jmer> like I had no idea the master~4 was called a "sha-1 expression"
[11:23:13] <biberu> don't know, i guess blogs and things, the docs aren't doing any hand holding :)
[11:23:44] <jmer> indeed not
[11:24:15] <biberu> i wonder if the git pro book covers that
[11:24:23] <biberu> https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2
[11:24:50] <biberu> it's been a very long time since i read it
[11:25:03] <biberu> probably one of the best things i've done for productivity
[11:25:13] <jmer> THere are so many things I think "this could be interesting to read" but never get around to
[11:25:32] <biberu> the thing is that by actually learning git you get so much time you can spend on other things
[11:25:38] <jmer> I wonder if my new employer would be OK with me spending education budget on reading books xD
[11:26:12] <biberu> why wouldn't they?
[11:26:30] <jmer> biberu: I got the basics down pretty well, my problem is that when I need those not often used features I forget how it works from the last time I used it.
[11:27:01] <jmer> biberu: I've been here since november, I don't know... It's very corporate he might actually prefer me spending 10 times the amount on some instructor led course or something xD
[11:28:22] <biberu> fwiw, at $work books are fine :)
[11:28:26] <jmer> I will ask him, spending some time getting even more proficient with git might be well spent
[11:29:00] <jmer> biberu: at my former jobs it wouldn't "count" as work if I sat with my head in a book
[11:29:12] <biberu> that's stupid
[11:29:16] <jmer> yes
[11:29:19] <jmer> that's why they are former jobs
[11:29:30] <jmer> here where I am now, I actually don't know
[11:29:36] <biberu> i google for specifics when i'm doing something unusual too btw
[11:29:41] <jmer> I'm leaning to "sure go ahead, just coordinate with the team"
[11:29:55] <biberu> but it really helps that it isn't a black box, lets you ask the proper questions
[11:30:51] <jmer> biberu: yeah I think my problem is I only know the basic jargon. Thanks for helping making this more clear ^^
[11:35:17] <biberu> i don't know if i clarified anything :)
[11:35:31] <jmer> you helped me identify my... "weakness"
[11:35:49] <jmer> I knew I could improve my git knowledge, but i had trouble identifying how
[11:36:31] <jmer> I'm not the type that just sits down and creates a repo to check stuff in and out and try to do weird things... I don't really leearn much from that. I need to see it in a real life context
[11:36:37] <jmer> for it to "click"
[11:37:33] <biberu> the book has helpful graphs that might help with that

[11:58:21] <jmer> MatthiasVance: so when will you print something useful? :P
[11:58:27] <MatthiasVance> Good question
[11:58:29] <MatthiasVance> :D
[11:58:40] <jmer> I admit I am teasing, I think 3D printers are cool
[11:58:42] <jmer> very cool
[11:59:04] <MatthiasVance> I think if the weather gets colder again I'll print an ice scraper
[11:59:13] <jmer>  but I wouldn't really know  what useful purposes I could use for it... I don't have small plastic thingies break that often
[12:00:17] <jmer> How much fillament would you need for an icescraper?
[12:01:14] <jmer> What I am trying to gauge is, would it be cheaper to print it yourself or just buy one?
[12:01:54] <biberu> 3d printing suddenly reminded me of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autofac
[12:02:09] <biberu> please don't end the world MatthiasVance

[12:16:07] <biberu> MatthiasVance: why not end the world?
[12:16:19] <MatthiasVance> jmer: If I go for a more simple version which STILL looks more sturdy than store bought.. it will cost EUR 0,63 in material and the store-bought is EUR 0,99
[12:16:24] <MatthiasVance> biberu: Yes
[12:16:39] <MatthiasVance> biberu: Also in what way do you think that might happen? Then I will try to avoid it. :D
[12:16:54] <biberu> MatthiasVance: the first sign would be that the printer prints printers
[12:17:01] <MatthiasVance> How about DNA?
[12:17:19] <MatthiasVance> Does that count as bad?
[12:17:21] <jmer> MatthiasVance: did you include the power usage in that price comparison?
[12:17:33] <MatthiasVance> I did not, will check, hold on
[12:17:52] <biberu> MatthiasVance: i'm not sure, probably not until it starts replicating?
[12:18:14] <jmer> I would be quite impressed if a end user 3D printer can outperform chinese plastic factories xD
[12:18:33] <jmer> Admittedly that's not the primary usecase for a 3D printer
[12:19:01] <jmer> and it's no where near as fun to buy a shitty icescraper as it is to create your own, maybe modify it to have "Ice Ice Baby" engraved
[12:19:17] <MatthiasVance> jmer: Still cheaper, printer takes 270W, 3h45m printing .. adds about 0,15 EUR

[12:40:31] <MatthiasVance> Only have it against his skin yeah
[12:40:33] <MatthiasVance> The rest, definitely not
[12:40:38] <jmer> Are you sure? xD
[12:40:46] <MatthiasVance> Pretty sure yeah xD
[12:40:50] <jmer> how old is he?
[12:40:53] <MatthiasVance> 3
[12:41:05] <MatthiasVance> Haven't been putting things in his mouth for quite some time
[12:41:14] <MatthiasVance> *hasn't
[12:41:20] <jmer> no but then he might be putting them... other places... later...
[12:41:42] <jmer> If it's the wrong chemical, just skin contact will add to the chemical cocktail we are exposed to.

[12:50:12] <jmer> I have a couple of home projects I need to fix when I get around to it
[12:50:35] <jmer> one of the faucets in our master bathroom started dripping so I had to turn it off and the source
[12:50:39] <MaNa2k> just wondering, how difficult is it to start your own software company ?
[12:50:40] <jmer> .. and I need to get some new O-rings for it.
[12:50:44] <MaNa2k> anyone here with experiance
[12:50:51] <jmer> MaNa2k: it's not difficult. The hard part is making it a succesful one xD
[12:50:57] <MaNa2k> lol
[12:50:58] <MaNa2k> ofc
[12:51:15] <Babbage> hey
[12:51:17] <MaNa2k> jmer, what about freelancing, i hear people make good money there
[12:51:27] <MaNa2k> on these freelancer sites
[12:51:28] <jmer> MaNa2k: freelancing isn't exactly the same as starting your own company
[12:51:44] <jmer> it's less of a hassle because you pay others to help track down customers, handling the book keeping etc.
[12:51:44] <MaNa2k> jmer, yes i know, was thinking of something else now
[12:52:13] <jmer> but starting a company, you need to do bookkeeping.. .and that would probably bore the hell out of me
[12:52:17] <MaNa2k> jmer, i mean, if im working as a freelance coder,
[12:53:11] <MaNa2k> i mean you cant realyl compete against people from 3rd world country
[12:53:34] <jmer> ofc you can
[12:53:36] <jmer> but  not on price
[12:53:50] <jmer> you need to compete on quality, safety, being in the same timezone, understanding the culture etc.
[12:54:00] <MaNa2k> mhm
[12:54:13] <MaNa2k> good points
[12:54:28] <jmer> and even if you outsource, you still need someone hired to check up on quality of the outsourced work (which from most sources I've asked, was totally shit)
[12:54:41] <MaNa2k> was thinking of doing something on the side, because my current workplace is burning me out
[12:54:50] <jmer> Change work place instead
[12:55:01] <jmer> if you are burned out, you won't have the neergy to spend your free time working
[12:55:19] <MatthiasVance> Yeah MaNa2k you get lots of freedom with freelancing but it will cost you MORE energy at first
[12:55:36] <MaNa2k> jmer, the thing is, when i get home after work, i cant deceide what to do.
[12:55:41] <Diablo-D3> dude
[12:55:43] <Diablo-D3> I wake up
[12:55:44] <MatthiasVance> MaNa2k: Start looking around now, don't need to change jobs, but the longer you look around the more things you come across and can filter ohh this is a nice company
[12:55:46] <Diablo-D3> and I cant decide what to do
[12:55:50] *** Joins: pingo (~pingo@84-255-226-67.static.t-2.net)

[12:55:53] <MatthiasVance> Also don't just apply to companies but rather talk with them to see if you're a match
[12:55:57] <Diablo-D3> and then I go to bed
[12:56:16] <MatthiasVance> Diablo-D3: That sucks
[12:56:33] <Diablo-D3> its not even the "decide what to do" part
[12:56:38] <Diablo-D3> its the "want to do anything at all" part

[12:57:23] <jmer> I don't know what this says about my social life, but it's barely been affected by the pandemic
[12:57:30] <Diablo-D3> jmer: thats the weird part
[12:57:32] <Diablo-D3> I kind of havent either
[12:57:37] <Diablo-D3> people are creatures to be avoided
[12:57:47] <Diablo-D3> covid is just easy mode on that
[12:57:48] <jmer> Diablo-D3: "Hell is other people"
[12:57:53] <MatthiasVance> FUTURAMA
[12:58:16] <MatthiasVance> Also Futurama is "okay"
[12:58:26] <Diablo-D3> futurama is weird
[12:58:30] <MatthiasVance> Mildly entertaining, so now I have to watch it till the end
[12:58:42] <Diablo-D3> I used to think it was okay, then it became good, then it became one of the best things ever on tv
[12:58:51] <MatthiasVance> Oh
[12:58:57] <MatthiasVance> So I should definitely keep watching
[12:58:58] <jmer> I like Futurama as well
[12:59:12] <Diablo-D3> mind you, my opinion changed *after* it had stopped airing, and I watched all of it when it aired
[12:59:27] <jmer> I don't think Futurama ever aired on a danish network
[12:59:29] <MatthiasVance> bbl, going to construct my old desk .. hopefully I can find the materials xD
[12:59:36] <Diablo-D3> Im not sure if its because it actually is good, or TV has gone to such fucking awful shit that its brilliant in comparison
[12:59:38] <MatthiasVance> They are probably in the box "construction materials"
[12:59:50] <Diablo-D3> but you probably want to watch futurama twice
[12:59:50] <MatthiasVance> Diablo-D3: Hm, it doesn't compare to Rick & Morty of course :P
[12:59:56] <MatthiasVance> I never watch anything twice
[12:59:57] <Diablo-D3> no, its better than rick and morty
[13:00:00] <MatthiasVance> wtf
[13:00:07] <Diablo-D3> rick and morty still has a lot of fucking "tries too hard" going on
[13:00:13] <MatthiasVance> Yes, that's true
[13:00:21] <MatthiasVance> Anyway bbl
[13:00:22] <Diablo-D3> I really do like rick and morty, but it needs to just fucking conclude the goddamned fucking plot already
[13:00:32] <jmer> THere's a plot in Rick and morty!?
[13:00:46] <jmer> I thought it was just about Rick ego masturbating all over several parallel universes
[13:00:56] <Diablo-D3> technically yes
[13:00:57] *** Quits: Slide-O-Mix (~slide@user/slide-o-mix) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[13:01:00] <Diablo-D3> but its more of a sliding scale on that
[13:01:12] <Diablo-D3> not _every_ rick is 100% maximum asshole
[13:01:19] <Diablo-D3> not _every_ morty is a useless shit
[13:01:25] <jmer> THat's true
[13:01:44] <jmer> allthough I don't spend much time watching series or movies
[13:02:26] <Diablo-D3> our rick has made an enemy of the council of ricks, but its not actually well understood why
[13:02:28] *** Joins: Slide-O-Mix (~slide@user/slide-o-mix)

[13:02:59] <Diablo-D3> yes but
[13:03:01] <Diablo-D3> NONE of them do

[13:03:45] <Diablo-D3> they still recognize that they're better off together than fucking around with the morons in their own home universes, which are all variations of the same morons
[13:04:13] <Tobbi_> Morning.
[13:04:26] <jmer> ... I haven't really given Rick and Morty any philosophical thoughts... I just enjoy the crass humour xD
[13:04:31] <Diablo-D3> jmer: the sliding scale on rick isnt how much of an asshole he is, but how much does he fucking hate himself
[13:04:36] <jmer> generally any humour that is offensive is attractive to me
[13:04:56] <jmer> which is really weird because I don't like to offend people at all...
[13:05:08] <jmer> but the darker, the more perverted fucked up the humour is, the better.
[13:05:16] <Diablo-D3> our rick is probably the most self-hating of them all
[13:05:23] <jmer> sadly this means I can't tell a lot of jokes at work because it's simnply too inappropriate xD
[13:05:35] <Diablo-D3> yeah no, my humor is absolutely fucking broke
[13:05:45] <jmer> hey Tobbi_
[13:05:52] <jmer> Tobbi_: check out the comic link I sent earlier in the day
[13:06:01] <Diablo-D3> example: I like my coffee like I like my women, put in a burlap sack and dragged over the andes
[13:06:01] <Tobbi_> Did you ping me?
[13:06:11] <jmer> Tobbi_: yes
[13:06:18] <Tobbi_> ah, was wondering who did
[13:06:34] <jmer> Diablo-D3: heh... Nice one :D
[13:06:40] <Diablo-D3> or, how many irishmen does it take to screw in a lightbulb? one to hold the bulb up, 20 to drink until the room spins around
[13:06:58] <jmer> Yeah... jokes that plays on stereotypes are awesome
[13:07:17] <Tobbi_> jmer: Damn, that is spot on :D
[13:07:37] <Diablo-D3> but yeah, no, our rick hates ricks the most, thats the only thing that differentiates him
[13:07:38] <Tobbi_> I have to print this.
[13:07:52] <jmer> Tobbi_: it made me think about you... And I thought you had to see the comic, because it shows that being uncertain is quite common. Most people just hide it xD
[13:08:01] <Diablo-D3> so what morty hates rick the most? evil morty, who now runs the council of ricks.
[13:08:26] <jmer> Diablo-D3: I haven't seen the entire latest season... The streaming services I have avialable are being a bitch about it
[13:08:35] <Diablo-D3> I havent seen any of the latest season
[13:08:37] <jmer> and I buried Skull n Bones many years ago
[13:09:06] <Diablo-D3> yeah no, you basically have to pirate it
[13:09:25] <jmer> I'll just wait. Eventually it'll pop up on a service I have access to
[13:09:26] <Diablo-D3> adult swim is really fucking weird about licensing shit
[13:09:30] <jmer> yes
[13:09:39] <jmer> which is a shame, because htey have nice stuff
[13:10:00] <Diablo-D3> its a real shame because IT'D BE NICE IF THEY FINISHED SHIT
[13:10:15] <Diablo-D3> WHERES THE END OF METALOCALYPSE ASSHOLES
[13:10:23] <jmer> oh man
[13:10:33] <jmer> I forgot about Metalocalypse
[13:10:40] <jmer> that was awesome
[13:10:51] <jmer> A metal head I used to hang with introduced it to me
[13:11:15] <jmer> then he got married to a bimbo with sillicone implants and he turned into... a 60s era clothing model wannabe
[13:11:29] <Diablo-D3> .... buh.
[13:11:45] <Diablo-D3> I think I just felt one of my few remaining braincells die
[13:11:58] <jmer> as long as you have two...
[13:12:09] <jmer> The retarded one and the other to push it around in it's wheel chair
[13:12:58] <MatthiasVance> Fun, the box labeled "construction" doesn't have much labeled bags with nuts and bolts in there
[13:13:05] <Diablo-D3> jesus christ, voting republican here I come
[13:13:25] <jmer> Diablo-D3: please no... No more US politics
[13:13:49] <jmer> I'm pissed enough that I have to pay 5x gas prices and they just warned about food prices going up 20%
[13:13:52] <MatthiasVance> jmer: LOL @ "then he got married to a bimbo"
[13:13:58] <jmer> gas as in gas, not gasoline
[13:14:23] <jmer> MatthiasVance: It's a true story, I never saw a dude change so much after going into a relationship... He's a totally different person now.
[13:14:28] <Diablo-D3> feed me taco bell, you will get all the gas you could ever want
[13:14:41] <MatthiasVance> jmer: Here too, food prices going up. Supermarket says their partners want to up it by 20% and they disagree. The partners say "that's not the case, our suppliers also need increased prices, but it's not 20% but we won't say how much it is out of respect to our ongoing talks"
[13:14:43] <jmer> Diablo-D3: As long as you can fart into my gas stove I wouldn't mind it...
[13:14:49] <Diablo-D3> also, btw, some women really are goddamned demons
[13:14:55] <Diablo-D3> its rare, but Ive seen it
[13:14:57] <MatthiasVance> jmer: I wonder if he's happy conforming
[13:15:03] <jmer> MatthiasVance: he seems happy
[13:15:06] <MatthiasVance> Good!
[13:15:13] <Diablo-D3> they just become... broken. I dont know what the fuck voodoo is going on, but fuck that shit
[13:15:25] <MatthiasVance> Sometimes people come out of relationships "like that" .. and only afterwards realize they haven't been themselves for quite a few years
[13:15:28] <jmer> Yeah... But he turned into the very type of person we used to critisize and tell crass jokes about
[13:15:43] <Diablo-D3> they say they're happy, but soon as they're out of it they're like FUCK MAN THE FUCK HOW THE FUCK THE FUCK
[13:15:46] *** Quits: Brett[Air] (~Brett@27-32-147-253.static.tpgi.com.au) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[13:15:55] <jmer> Diablo-D3: I was in such a relationship for 4 years
[13:16:04] <jmer> at least I was smart enough to reject getting her pregnant when she suggested it
[13:16:16] <Diablo-D3> man, I think I was almost in one, but Im not sure
[13:16:42] <jmer> She didn't change me as a person though... but in hindsight I don't know why I put up with her for that long
[13:16:54] <jmer> I just remember when she broke up with me for another guy it was a mixture of sorrow and immense relief
[13:17:05] <jmer> weirdest feeling I've ever had
[13:17:10] <jmer> feeling sad while feeling giddy
[13:17:17] <Diablo-D3> like, she was mostly fine, but her parents were batshit, and I basically told her, either cut off contact with them if they refuse to leave their weird ass cult, or dont drag me into it
[13:17:21] <MatthiasVance> To be fair jmer if the other person says "ohh I really like that on you" that's really nice to hear
[13:17:34] <MatthiasVance> And it might be good, even though it's totally a different thing
[13:17:44] <MatthiasVance> So even if you would NEVER consider that before I see how that might work
[13:17:50] <Diablo-D3> like, she was the sole income in that household, and she made legitimately good money, but they were like "why dont you quit working, and get married, and have kids"
[13:18:03] <Diablo-D3> and its like, brah, if she quits her job, *y'all homeless*
[13:18:07] <MatthiasVance> :o
[13:18:11] <jmer> MatthiasVance: the clothes look cool and classy... But when he got married he wanted me to be the first man, but he expected me to spend 2000€ on clothing to match his morning and evening attires
[13:18:20] <MatthiasVance> jmer: holy shit
[13:18:27] <Babbage> Diablo-D3: thankyou for introducing me to metalocalypse just now :)
[13:18:39] <Diablo-D3> Babbage: it is ridiculously brilliant.
[13:18:45] <jmer> MatthiasVance: Yeah...
[13:18:58] <Babbage> they all shorts (like youtube seems to be) or proper length episodes?
[13:19:00] <jmer> MatthiasVance: and then add travel and hotel expenses in Copenhagen in the vacatiuon season
[13:19:01] <MatthiasVance> I didn't tell my best man what to wear, he's my best man for a fucking reason
[13:19:30] <Diablo-D3> but yeah,..... its just so fucking weird, like, this woman, she just... she was ridiculously smart, and mildly funny, and was climbing the corporate ladder actually pretty fucking well
[13:19:51] <Diablo-D3> parents were like "no, women stay in home and produce babies" WHAT FUCKING CENTURY ARE WE IN
[13:20:08] <jmer> Diablo-D3: was she amish? xD
[13:20:11] <MatthiasVance> Diablo-D3: What was her reaction to that sentiment?
[13:20:29] <Diablo-D3> MatthiasVance: oh, she got pissed at me, and I told her to never talk to me again
[13:20:39] <MatthiasVance> Diablo-D3: No I mean to her parents
[13:20:52] <MatthiasVance> Because obviously she didn't agree but just let it slide every time?
[13:21:04] <Diablo-D3> kind of? its one of those guilt-based religions
[13:21:26] <Diablo-D3> she grew up in it, and still participated in it, yet didn't fit in it
[13:21:32] <jmer> Diablo-D3: which religion isn't guilt based?
[13:21:44] <jmer> Satanism maybe?...
[13:21:45] <MatthiasVance> MatthiasVance's Church of Comfort
[13:22:02] <jmer> MatthiasVance: wouldn't that just guilt trip you if you work too much?
[13:22:03] <jmer> xD
[13:22:05] <MatthiasVance> No
[13:22:13] <MatthiasVance> You do you
[13:22:19] <Diablo-D3> jehovah witnesses are nuts
[13:22:34] <jmer> Diablo-D3: Yeah... They are... Totally nuts
[13:22:51] <jmer> Had those fuckers ring my door more than once
[13:22:57] <Diablo-D3> I didnt know she was one in the beginning, but she really was a smart fucking person
[13:23:01] <jmer> I made them stop when I opened only in boxers.
[13:23:07] <MatthiasVance> Put up one of those plates jmer that if they ring the bell they have to pay money xD
[13:23:13] <MatthiasVance> "By ringing the bell you agree to pay X"
[13:23:19] <Diablo-D3> I met her on irc, of all places
[13:23:28] <jmer> MatthiasVance: I think my fat ass body only in boxers will scare most away
[13:23:28] <Diablo-D3> found out she was a her, and lived not all that far away
[13:23:35] <MatthiasVance> jmer: :D
[13:23:40] <jmer> Ok I'm not that fat
[13:23:45] <jmer> but I was cranky and had a severe hangover
[13:23:49] <MatthiasVance> Yeah I got the point
[13:23:56] <Diablo-D3> and its like, how the fuck do you *work in tech*, *as a woman*, *as a management position and climbing up that ladder*, and be a JW
[13:23:58] <jmer> and I was pissed they had the audactity to ring my bell at 10 AM a Saturday
[13:24:00] <Diablo-D3> it just doesnt fucking square
[13:24:13] <MatthiasVance> Oh yes fuck that, I had that often when living in a bigger city, not happening anymore here
[13:24:47] <jmer> Diablo-D3: I used to work with a super smart medico engineer
[13:24:57] <MatthiasVance> jmer: So if I can't find the screws of my old desk I can just print some? xD
[13:25:01] <jmer> Diablo-D3: and then when he said he had to go to church on sunday I didn't believe him and started joking with it
[13:25:09] <jmer> and then it turned out he was a mormon or something a long those lines
[13:25:11] <MatthiasVance> What is a medico engineer?
[13:25:12] <jmer> deeply religious
[13:25:24] <Diablo-D3> I just dont get it
[13:25:36] <Diablo-D3> like, believe in religion all you want, it probably even helps some people
[13:25:36] <jmer> MatthiasVance: he's an engineer that specializes in medical equipment like Xray machines, proton cannons etc.
[13:25:43] <Diablo-D3> but don't fuck over your kids like that
[13:25:54] <MatthiasVance> ah!
[13:26:06] <MatthiasVance> But didn't think there was a big bang jmer ?
[13:26:11] <Diablo-D3> I havent talked to her in years, but I bet she married some fuckface of a dude and now regrets everything because her parents were truly evil
[13:26:41] <jmer> MatthiasVance: I didn't ask too much... I liked the guy... And my views on religion aren't exactly... Helpful when trying to develop a good relationship to a deeply religious coworker xD
[13:26:57] <Diablo-D3> but its like, I set boundaries on that, she didn't agree with them, so she made that choice.
[13:27:10] <MatthiasVance> Yup
[13:27:16] <jmer> Diablo-D3: imagine being forced to choose between a partner and the entirety of your family?
[13:27:30] <Diablo-D3> I know a lot of people like that, jmer
[13:27:40] <Diablo-D3> they chose being happy with someone that wanted them over their family.
[13:27:43] <jmer> Well you live in the US, so of course you do Diablo-D3
[13:27:58] <jmer> The capital of religious nut jobbery
[13:28:28] <Diablo-D3> whats weird is, thats a minority of assholes
[13:28:35] <Diablo-D3> going to church doesnt make you a religious nutjob
[13:28:40] <jmer> yeah but they sure do make a lot of noise

[13:31:52] <Tobbi_> Diablo-D3: I would...
[13:31:56] <Diablo-D3> DIABLO WHY YOU SO ANGRY AND BITTER
[13:31:56] <Tobbi_> But there's no one here I fancy
[13:32:07] <Diablo-D3> because I fucking met people.
[13:32:09] <Diablo-D3> thats why.
[13:32:24] <Diablo-D3> like, I got all the problems I have and all
[13:32:42] <Diablo-D3> but all you fuckers who grew up in decent households and never really had fucking problems, whats your fucking issue
[13:32:51] <Diablo-D3> you just wake up every day and choose to be a fucktard?
[13:32:58] <Diablo-D3> holy fucking fuck.
[13:33:00] <Tobbi_> IDK, sometimes a condom may break...that could be considered a fucking issue :P
[13:33:10] <Tobbi_> Yes, I know, my jokes aren't helping
[13:33:16] <Tobbi_> Sorry.
[13:33:32] <Diablo-D3> were you not here when jmer and me agreed dark humor is best humor?
[13:33:39] <Tobbi_> Oh okay, in that case...
[13:33:56] <MaNa2k> lol
[13:34:06] <MaNa2k> are we talking about life today
[13:34:19] <Diablo-D3> I think its a requirement to have enjoyment of dark humor to even be in tech at all
[13:34:22] <jmer> Diablo-D3: I don't think it's a choice, they simply can't help themselves. They have been indoctrinated into believeing that everything "bad" happening in their lives aren't their fauylt but the fault of opposing political parties, god's will or some other external factor.
[13:34:35] <Tobbi_> Life, the universe and everything.
[13:34:44] <Diablo-D3> jmer: sure, but some fuckers really go above and beyond
[13:35:20] <jmer> Diablo-D3: In most cases (except with people with psychopathic traits) I think you need to blame ignorance more than malice
[13:36:01] <Diablo-D3> dude, Im pretty sure half the fucking population is somewhere on the psychopath spectrum
[13:36:27] <eurogos> i have v good friends that escaped the mormon church
[13:36:28] <Tobbi_> you could say they're taking the psycho-path in life.
[13:36:42] <Diablo-D3> godfuckingdamnit
[13:36:44] <eurogos> their stories sound like something out of the handmaids tale
[13:37:03] <Diablo-D3> Tobbi_: I am going to remember this for later, others must suffer
[13:37:32] <Tobbi_> I once worked with a borderline coworker...
[13:37:37] <Tobbi_> I didn't even notice how she manipulated me
[13:37:45] <Tobbi_> It was fucking horrible and I was glad when she left.
[13:37:59] <Diablo-D3> yeah no, like, people who do that are super-obvious to me
[13:38:00] <Tobbi_> things have improved a lot by then.
[13:38:03] <Tobbi_> Ah okay
[13:38:11] <Diablo-D3> thats arguably a defect btw
[13:38:16] <Tobbi_> Maybe I'm autistic so I won't notice
[13:38:17] <Diablo-D3> you're not supposed to be able to see it
[13:38:23] <Diablo-D3> oh no, see, thats the fun part
[13:38:27] <Diablo-D3> being autistic means you will notice
[13:38:37] <Diablo-D3> because that part of your brain isnt filtering shit out like its supposed to
[13:38:40] <jmer> That's entirely dependant on HOW autistic you are
[13:38:42] <Tobbi_> oh okay.
[13:38:49] <Tobbi_> Whatever...
[13:39:15] <Diablo-D3> jmer: technically yes, but if you dont have that, arguably, you might not be autistic enough to be autistic
[13:39:39] <Diablo-D3> but yeah, Im autistic, I will absolutely fucking notice it
[13:39:40] <Tobbi_> I could a) debug this one shitty issue which involves databases and tables wrongly joined I think... or b) continue writing this documentation...
[13:39:43] <Tobbi_> or c) play games :D
[13:39:51] <jmer> Diablo-D3: What I mean is; You're not filtering stuff out... So you are easily overwhelmed, which might make it harder to actually spot when someone is manipulating you
[13:40:01] <Diablo-D3> jmer: ahh, yes, that can be an issue
[13:40:10] <Diablo-D3> but thats technically a different issue
[13:40:18] <Tobbi_> I guess I'm not autistic then..I'm oblivious to many things...
[13:40:23] <jmer> Still related to autistic traits though Diablo-D3  ;)
[13:40:25] <Diablo-D3> some people have tried that on me, I think, just to be really fuckng loud
[13:40:33] <Diablo-D3> they just become a different red flag when they do
[13:40:59] <jmer> I think your resistance to manipulation is more based on life experience... i.e. you mentioned you've grown up with shitty problems... But studies has shown that people who had violent parents have an easier time spotting signs of impending violence
[13:41:13] <Diablo-D3> like, trump is mildly fascinating to me in a way
[13:41:30] <Diablo-D3> he can say one thing, hands are doing another, body language are doing another, and face is doing another
[13:41:45] <Diablo-D3> hes like not even a real person, its like some alien tried to act human and fucked it up
[13:41:45] <jmer> I am a lot harder to manipulate NOW, than 10 years ago.. .Because I've been manipulated so many times that I now know what to look for.
[13:42:03] <Diablo-D3> jmer: yeah, no, Im not really "resistant" to it as much as its just super fucking obvious
[13:42:24] <Diablo-D3> manipulators have to lie to themselves to make it work, and a lot of them are just bad liars
[13:42:41] <MaNa2k> jmer, the worst is when you are getting manipulated and you know it instinctively, but cant react to it
[13:42:57] <jmer> MaNa2k: If you can't you're in the wrong environment
[13:42:58] <Diablo-D3> I just notice it because reading emotions was something I had to learn, instead of it being innate
[13:43:09] <MaNa2k> jmer, thats the shit i go through daily

[13:43:35] <Diablo-D3> and yeah, customer facing roles 100% is not reacting right this second
[13:43:50] <Diablo-D3> its waiting until they've left and accidentally deleting their user account
[13:43:53] <Diablo-D3> "whops"
[13:43:57] <Diablo-D3> er, "whoops"
[13:44:06] <MaNa2k> jmer, i know i know, but cant seems to land any. was on 4 different interviews i think. Landed none
[13:44:21] <jmer> MaNa2k: 4 is nothing
[13:44:22] <MaNa2k> all of them through head hunters
[13:44:33] <MaNa2k> basically they reached out to me
[13:44:40] <Diablo-D3> oh, head hunters are fucking scammers
[13:44:41] <jmer> that doesn't mean much
[13:44:42] <MaNa2k> so i guess i havnt really been applying myself
[13:44:47] <jmer> Diablo-D3: I have to say; not all..
[13:44:54] <Diablo-D3> jmer: a. l. l.
[13:45:01] <jmer> I know a handful of decent recruiters that aren't just BS'ing you
[13:45:17] <jmer> but they're usually independant ones
[13:45:29] <jmer> not hired in those big headhunting/recruitment companies, because those definately suck
[13:46:01] <MaNa2k> ive been through nigal frank a couple of times
[13:46:08] <jmer> Diablo-D3: also I think there's a huge difference in how recruitment is done in the US and in Europe... I mean I had a US recruiter contact me for relocation and work for Amazon and it was obvious he was just spamming several clients with the same cookie cutter message
[13:47:15] <Diablo-D3> maybe
[13:48:51] <Diablo-D3> and re: being resistant to manipulation, said ex girlfriend, she was a case of that, she was abused and was always hyperalert about it, but her fucking issue is she tried to also be an abuser, but neither had the skills nor the conviction to do it

[14:14:38] <ap5> Covid finally got the hold of me and my entire family
[14:21:03] <MaNa2k> ap5, why? didnt you vaccinate ?
[14:21:16] <MaNa2k> or is it the new variant maybe ?
[14:21:59] <biberu> MaNa2k: if you're thinking of getting another job it might be good to practice some interviews
[14:22:12] <ap5> Nope. We are all are vaccinated as much as we can. I am really sick. Fever etc. But i think i am going to be ok.
[14:22:15] <MaNa2k> biberu, how ?
[14:22:28] <MaNa2k> ap5, mhm
[14:22:42] <ap5> Go to some. Just say yes to some and use it as practice. I did that.
[14:22:47] <MaNa2k> ap5, i know some guys took their 3rd shot, got really sick for a whole week, then were back to normal
[14:23:12] <MaNa2k> ap5, lol i like it
[14:23:19] <MaNa2k> maybe ill just try that
[14:23:26] <biberu> MaNa2k: you can apply to jobs so that you're familiar with the process, you might even find something you like and accept it
[14:23:48] <biberu> MaNa2k: you don't want to hold out for a dream job and have *zero* interviewing experience when it comes up
[14:23:50] <ap5> It really helped me on those "describe yourself" questions.
[14:24:12] <MaNa2k> biberu, the funny thing is, all the jobs i have had up untill now, i though i would never get it, but i got em anyhow, maybe i was more relaxed or something
[14:24:21] <MaNa2k> *thought
[14:24:24] <ap5> And i got a pretty good picture on how much i could ask for in salary
[14:24:34] <biberu> MaNa2k: if you have friends in hiring positions maybe ask those if they can help, ask on linkedin or something

[14:41:32] <MaNa2k> nice
[14:43:00] <kobo> When reading about project structures there seems to be quite commong with a DAL(data access layer) but if using EF, shouldn't that be part of the business logic kind of?
[14:43:07] <kobo> to be able to utilize IQueryable alot
[14:43:51] <ap5> ACII a stupid question, get a stupid ANSI

[14:44:56] <ap5> ASCII*
[14:45:03] <ap5> :D
[14:50:12] <jmer> kobo: I recently got introduced to Vertical Slice Architecture... It resonates a lot more with me than having a single DAL that is reused across features.
[14:50:40] <ap5> I use vertical slicing. It is good. I like it.
[14:51:12] <kobo> will googling vertical slice architecture yield some good readings ut hink jmer?
[14:51:27] <jmer> ap5: we're moving to that type of architecture... We need to split out a monolith, so first step is vertical slice architecture... To ease the process of isolating services (which eventually might end up as microservices)
[14:51:51] <jmer> kobo: yes... Alternatively look up "CodeOpinion" on youtube, he has a video about it.
[14:52:07] <jmer> where he demonstrates refactoring a monolith into a vertical slice monolith
[14:52:25] <ap5> jmer: we are in the process of doing it on our microservices. I really like the readability.
[14:52:31] <jmer> generally I like CodeOpinion because he doesn't just tout the latest architecture fad as the one truth, he actually looks at many diff architectures and compares them

[15:23:10] <MaNa2k> starting this new project, and im suppose to copy th folder structure of another project the senior has done, the only problem is i dont understand a single line what the senior has written
[15:23:22] <MaNa2k> folder and file structure
[15:24:24] <interop_madness> does anyone know a way to pinpoint the source of a particular request that's showing up in the browser's network tab? I've got a completely invalid request URL and I have no idea where it's coming from
[15:25:11] <MaNa2k> interop_madness, fiddler maybe ?
[15:25:25] <MaNa2k> or whireshark if your hardcore
[15:26:00] <interop_madness> MaNa2k, no I mean the source is the web application I'm debugging but I'd like to know the exact originator of the request within the web app's codebase
[15:26:12] <biberu> interop_madness: since it's javascript you could replace e.g. fetch or xmlhttprequest with own code and add some logging / break there
[15:26:23] <MaNa2k> mhm
[15:26:30] <interop_madness> it could be XHR, it could be a <script> - who knows
[15:26:48] <interop_madness> the Url is basically just a "!" concatenated to the web app's site url
[15:26:54] <biberu> you can see that in the network log
[15:27:02] <biberu> if it's loading a script or performing a background request
[15:27:30] <MatthiasVance> MaNa2k: Why can't you understand it?

[15:28:55] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, well im not junior or senior. im just a developer
[15:29:05] <MatthiasVance> MaNa2k: So what makes that person a senior?
[15:29:10] <MaNa2k> worked around 9 or so years i think
[15:29:14] <MaNa2k> with coding
[15:29:23] <jmer> kobo: If it's about several classes in one file doesn't he himself mention it's a matter of personal preference?
[15:29:36] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, dont really know, maybe age
[15:29:42] <kobo> yeah he does, but just asking if you do it like that too
[15:29:46] <MatthiasVance> MaNa2k: Bad reason :D
[15:29:48] <MaNa2k> because the its deffinatlny not because of the code
[15:29:58] <kobo> and when you split stuff up in that way, which I like, but when if you have some code that you want to reuse?
[15:30:03] <MatthiasVance> Then I'd stop refering to that person as "the senior" if that's not their position MaNa2k :)
[15:30:06] <jmer> kobo I have an almost perverted focus on structure so no I prefer stuff in their own files.
[15:30:09] <MatthiasVance> Especially if it's only because of age
[15:30:19] <MatthiasVance> jmer: Even records?
[15:30:30] <jmer> MatthiasVance: I haven't written code using records yet.
[15:30:31] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, well she literally got the senior role
[15:30:42] <MatthiasVance> MaNa2k: Ah right you work with 1 or 2 other people right
[15:30:46] <MaNa2k> is in her 50s
[15:30:50] <MatthiasVance> Yeah I remember now
[15:30:54] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, only 1 dev
[15:31:11] <jmer> MatthiasVance: before I changed jobs I was stuck on .net 4.8
[15:31:18] <kobo> jmer, how do you solve it when you need the same functionality in multiple places then? like fetch a user or such
[15:31:19] <MatthiasVance> jmer: Either records or F# (which also uses records but insists on order too) allow you to store a lot more  information on one screen without getting lost
[15:31:32] <jmer> MatthiasVance: and at my curren tjob the only task I've had was a .net 6 upgrade and then adding a column and getting it passed on until it ends up in a .json file
[15:31:35] <MatthiasVance> kobo: Reuse the implementation
[15:31:45] <jmer> and this has taken me months because I am also learning systems and trying to be a good little boyscout
[15:32:05] <MatthiasVance> jmer: Are they happy with "progress" / outcome?
[15:32:09] <MatthiasVance> I'd hope so :D
[15:32:16] <jmer> I am
[15:32:20] <jmer> immensely satisfied
[15:32:24] <kobo> but I mean he seems in the video to have all the code regarding "GetMyOrders" in the "GetMyOrdersHandler.cs", and let's say for the orders you'd need to calculate the total sum of the order
[15:32:33] <MatthiasVance> jmer: I meant your employer :D
[15:32:34] <kobo> That could be needed in more places thatn just the "GetMyOrders"
[15:32:35] <jmer> some stuff takes longer, but in general people aren't flailing amateurs
[15:32:52] <jmer> MatthiasVance: I feel like I am in a team where I am no longer the only one thinking one step ahead.
[15:32:54] <MatthiasVance> kobo: What are you on about?
[15:33:06] <MatthiasVance> jmer: Ah so it's okay if you take the time to improve shit? That's great
[15:33:18] <kobo> MatthiasVance, we were talking about vertical slices
[15:33:31] <jmer> MatthiasVance: We have an incentive goal that says 80% maintenance/paying off tech debt and 20% feature development :P

[15:45:05] <kobo> anyone here used vertical slices instead of some other architecture? Or got any negative to say about it?
[15:45:38] <kobo> i hate that they removed the downvote function of youtube
[15:45:39] <ap5> Vertical slicing is a good concept. It makes code more readable, but you will get a lot more code duplication in the start, but as you will notice, it saves your ass the day one slice diverges from another.
[15:46:27] <kobo> ap5, yeah but the code duplication seem to be solvable by having the "domain" layer, which would hold what's duplicated I suppose
[15:46:28] *** Quits: Carko_ (~Darko@84-255-241-35.static.t-2.net) (Client Quit)
[15:46:48] <ap5> Say you have five slices, and all five have the same SQL to select customers.
[15:47:10] <kobo> yeah that should reside in the domain layer then
[15:47:22] <ap5> kobo, you should be careful of what you put in the shared library
[15:48:22] <ap5> kobo, no. Because you can't easily change the shared code. You don't know what will break. If the code is in a slice, only that slice will break. That is the true power of it
[15:48:22] <kobo> I suppose the shared domain layer would in this case return an IQueryable<Customer> to each feature
[15:49:10] <kobo> yeah but that will be crap to maintain when something changes, lets say you add a hidden prop to customer, and they should never show up
[15:49:13] <ap5> I wouldn't put that in the shared
[15:49:28] <kobo> now you have to fix 123 features to care about the "hidden" prop
[15:49:54] <ap5> Yes. It isn't a silver bullet. But it is wrong to put it in the shared library
[15:50:25] <kobo> why not
[15:52:36] <ap5> Well. In our team it wouldn't go in. But feel free to do it yourself :) we would want to keep references to the minimum
[15:53:33] <ap5> If we should move a slice out in a microservice it should be to only move that slice in a solution of it's own and not: the slice + some of the shared code.
[15:54:17] <ap5> Or delete a slice. We delete the slice, and not the slice + some shared logic that is only used by that slice.
[15:54:58] *** Quits: BSaboia (~bsaboia@189.45.78.253) (Quit: This computer has gone to sleep)
[15:55:11] <kobo> yeah I mean you would only put it in the domain if it needs to be shared, and in this case it'd be like a CustomerService or such, which returns a IQueryable<Customer> which would be pre-filtered(or have a parameter to include hidden for example)
[15:56:00] <kobo> sure it'd be a bit more work if you'd have to split it out to a separate microservice, but I think that's more rare than you have to change a bunch of code that resides in each of those features

[16:35:00] <jamea> hi all, anyone know how to extract text from a pdf file? thanks
[16:37:01] <jmer> jamea: if the PDF actually contains text you can copy/paste it normally if that's not possible it's because all the text is "like a picture" and then you need some kind of CR
[16:37:02] <jmer> OCR*
[16:39:44] <jmer> lol
[16:39:55] <jmer> I just found a method body that is enclosed in an #if DEBUG
[16:40:46] <jamea> its text...
[16:41:05] <jmer> jamea: then copy/paste it?
[16:41:10] <jmer> ... or did you mean how to do this with C#?
[16:42:45] <jamea> yes,. with c#
[16:43:14] <jmer> then you need a library
[16:43:29] <jmer> I googled up an opensource one called PDFSharp but I don't know if it's any good
[16:44:32] <jonp> i think pdfsharp usually *renders* PDFs, doesn't it?
[16:44:39] <jonp> which is quite different from "extract text from a pdf"…
[16:47:02] <jamea> can parse this library: PdfiumViewer  ?
[16:47:06] <jmer> jonp: the feature list includes reading/modifying exisiting ones
[16:47:17] <jmer> http://www.pdfsharp.net/PDFsharpFeatures.ashx
[16:47:17] <jonp> what is the "nature" of "modify"
[16:47:27] <jmer> "Supports PDF versions 1.2 through 1.4 (including the transparency features introduced with Adobe Reader 5.0); these files can be read and written"
[16:50:43] <xb0o2> PDFsharp is OK. It does fall over on some PDF files though.
[16:51:13] <jmer> my impression is you need to fork up some dough to get a PDF lib that handles most pdf files.
[16:51:17] <xb0o2> i.e. those that don't adhere to the standards but people expect you to deal with because Adobe does.
[16:53:05] <jmer> xb0o2: hah yeah. Good thing we have standards eh?
[16:54:35] <jamea> Pdfsharp is opensource?
[16:56:37] <xb0o2> Seems like a lot of people need them to remedy a lack of toilet paper jmer, so yeah. Good thing we have them.
[16:57:02] <jmer> says so here: http://www.pdfsharp.net/?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1

[18:05:49] <JakeSays> my newest laptop is 10'ish years old. i don't go anywhere these days so it suffices.
[18:06:13] <MatthiasVance> Same, only use laptops as thin clients when I'm away from desktop or as remote work stations to RDP into
[18:06:23] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: exactly
[18:06:43] <irwiss> jmer: imo the moment a major OEM backs it is the moment the project becomes pointless... cause you'll again get bundled superfish, crap components and chase for minimal effort maximum profit

[18:18:52] <brianonymous_> headphone repair is the worse. mainly cuz of the wire they use. omg i hate it

[18:20:13] <jmer> all products
[18:20:28] <jmer> if they break in less than two years (by normal usage) you're eligible for a replacement prodcut or a free repair
[18:20:42] <brianonymous_> i guess that means your chinese imports are way low?
[18:20:46] <jmer> and  then the period renews for another two years :D
[18:20:47] <JakeSays> the charge port on my tv headphones broke.
[18:20:52] <JakeSays> brianonymous_: LOL
[18:21:11] <jmer> brianonymous_: if you buy it from china you aren't protected in the same way but if there's a dansih importer then they have to follow those laws yes
[18:21:20] <brianonymous_> hah
[18:21:31] <brianonymous_> im both amazed and in awe and horrified :D
[18:22:05] <jmer> if you break it by misusing the product then they can charge you for repair or refuse to replace the product.

[18:24:20] <irwiss> jmer: it's not even "wear out", those are G533 which are actually pretty decent for the price, have superb range (pierce 2 walls and reach my kitchen), decent sound once you tune spectrum a bit, even have **replacable non-glued battery**(which is a real WTF)... but have the shittiest flimsiest microusb connector buried in tons of plastic
[18:24:58] <jmer> irwiss: if the connector breaks and you haven't forced/misused the product they would have to replace them or repair them
[18:24:59] <irwiss> so naturally it worked past warranty time... and then i managed to fuck up the connector because i shoved it just slightly angled...

[19:08:04] <jmer> Nasp: isn't that just mortgage? don't you own the apartment?
[19:08:04] <Nasp> Then there's the loan
[19:08:17] <Nasp> jmer:  No that's without mortgage
[19:08:18] <Nasp> Only rent
[19:08:30] <jmer> what are you renting then?
[19:08:36] <Nasp> My own apartment?
[19:08:38] <jmer> I mean... if you own the apartment why pay rent?
[19:08:46] <Nasp> because it's an apartment?
[19:08:56] <jmer> that... doesn't make sense to me at all xD
[19:08:58] <jonp> perhaps Nasp  means a mortgage?
[19:08:59] <Nasp> Don't you pay for trash and stuff like that in your house
[19:09:01] <jonp> or HOA fees?
[19:09:04] <Nasp> No i mean rent
[19:09:11] <jmer> but that is one of the big reasons why I avoided owning an apartment like that the rules are complicated and you can get burned badly
[19:09:12] <jonp> wtf are you "renting" if you *own* it?
[19:09:24] <xb0o2> Ground rent/service charges?
[19:09:25] <Nasp> Because you pay rent to the apartment complex
[19:09:26] <xb0o2> I presume
[19:09:31] <Nasp> Else what do you do if something breaks in the complex?

[19:12:05] <xb0o2> Is that a part ownership type thing?
[19:12:07] <jmer> property taxes
[19:12:19] <Nasp> That was due to it not being fair for people who couldn't afford buying an apartment or house
[19:12:25] <brianonymous_> oh, so it is hoa fees
[19:12:28] <Nasp> So it was taxes to balance our poor / rich ratio
[19:12:40] <xb0o2> Ah
[19:12:46] <dotdflat> Is someone experiencing issues on azure release pipeline/Europe?
[19:12:53] <brianonymous_> like a condo.. you buy it, but then pay out the ass to the condo association
[19:12:57] <dotdflat> Seems to be healthy anyway.
[19:13:20] <Nasp> xb0o2: So because you can afford to buy something, you need to be taxes so people owning and not owning pays the same :D
[19:13:25] <xb0o2> Only in name, I think, brianonymous_
[19:13:45] <Nasp> brianonymous_:  Well isn't a condo and hoa different
[19:13:50] <xb0o2> I think HOAs as they exist in America are mostly an American phenomenon

[19:13:58] <Nasp> With crazy rule and such
[19:14:03] <xb0o2> The "I can tell you what to do" type HOAs
[19:14:06] <Nasp> Here it's the company organizing the apartment complex

[19:14:34] <irwiss> https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/s9020g/weve_all_been_there/ lol
[19:14:59] <Nasp> If you rented an apartment there woudl be a company you paid to right
[19:15:01] <brianonymous_> i think what you have is a condo association.. and from what i understand the dif between condo and townhouse is who actually owns the roof
[19:15:08] <Nasp> But when you own you still need a company to maintain all that stuff
[19:15:29] <xb0o2> Either a collective or a company responsible for the communal maintenance of a building (e.g. a block of flats)
[19:16:01] <xb0o2> But not like "if you let your grass grow over 10cm we're going to fine yo ass"
[19:16:24] <Nasp> Exactly
[19:16:32] <Nasp> And i pay 250 euro for that
[19:17:56] <xb0o2> Funny there's a distinction brianonymous_: in the UK we don't use the term condo at all and a townhouse is a completely unrelated type of building :p
[19:18:39] <xb0o2> Nothing more helpful than different countries using the same word to talk about different, kind of related things

[22:42:32] <xb0o2> What, SSH?
[22:42:35] <xb0o2> Ah
[22:42:36] <irwiss> i don't understand how the fuck did they go from a shitty but half decent UI into this shit... how the fuck
[22:42:40] <ap5> jonp, it is just my blog, that i am moving to k8s to better manage it. I have had some trouble when upgrading, so now i run a single node k8s
[22:43:06] <xb0o2> First job is to disable password logins for SSH

[22:43:32] <ap5> xb0o2, :D lol i have done that. It is an old server
[22:43:36] <jonp> there's lots of types of attacks. :-)
[22:43:41] <ap5> I know
[22:43:50] <ap5> These smells like drive-bys
[22:43:51] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  Have you automated bed ejection?

[22:44:02] <viaSanctus> lol
[22:44:04] <irwiss> if you're not running php it's easier to just silence everything ".php", cause there's thousands of bots hitting random sites with the million php exploits
[22:44:07] <Nasp> ap5:  full blown k8s or k3s?'
[22:44:07] <viaSanctus> "bed ejection" lmfao
[22:44:18] <MatthiasVance> What is bed injection Nasp
[22:44:27] <viaSanctus> "ALARM GET THE F OUT OF BED"
[22:44:31] <Nasp> So the printers ejects the print when done
[22:44:34] <Nasp> You said you automated it
[22:44:39] <viaSanctus> oh
[22:44:39] *** Quits: bomb (~bomb@user/bomb) (Quit: ‎)
[22:44:40] <Nasp> So i assumed you fixed that
[22:44:53] <ap5> Nasp, just microk8s, so nothing fancy. I actully is doing this also partly because i want to mess around with helm, argo etc
[22:45:15] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Ohh no, everything up to the end
[22:45:20] <MatthiasVance> And glue of course
[22:46:39] <MatthiasVance> It's not like .. a factory xD

[22:47:16] <Nasp> Well you can do that its quite nice :D
[22:47:18] <Nasp> So it ejects it
[22:47:28] <MatthiasVance> But it's glued
[22:47:28] <MatthiasVance> xD
[22:47:29] <Nasp> ap5:  Yeah i want to do the same, i started k3s up
[22:47:37] <MatthiasVance> It's never going to eject anything
[22:47:43] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  You wait until it's cooled down and the it runs the bed ejection
[22:47:44] <MatthiasVance> Remember we have different machines
[22:47:54] <MatthiasVance> It will still be glued once it's cooled down
[22:48:18] <ap5> Nasp, i have just finished creating helm charts for my blog. It is pretty neat actually. I really like it
[22:48:54] <ap5> Before doing argo, i want the helm install to work
[22:49:25] <Nasp> Not sure i get the idea behind helm
[22:51:26] <ap5> Nasp. I have a blog, so i need: ingress, deployment, service. I define those in a /my_chart/templates folder, and run "helm install". It installs all. It can even uninstall and upgrade. I like it. And i have generic name for all of it, like {{ .Release.Name }}-service etc. Really nice.
[22:51:40] <ap5> Each resource gets its own file
[22:52:01] <Nasp> Yeah well one thing is if you create your own
[22:52:03] <ap5> so i have /template/ingress.yaml, /template/service.yaml etc
[22:52:05] <Nasp> But i dont get those premade charts
[22:52:15] <ap5> Ah. Neither do i
[22:52:21] <ap5> I dont use those
[22:53:09] <Nasp> Especially those that installs and setup a database with storage
[22:53:13] <ap5> I am impressed that i got this to work almost in first try :D All these k8s digging i have done, have finally paid of
[22:53:15] <Nasp> Not sure i would trust those to do the right thing :D
[22:53:22] <Nasp> How do you deploy your stuff
[22:53:23] <ap5> No :D
[22:53:27] <Nasp> Gitops, pushing it to the cluster or
[22:53:41] <ap5> Right now it is "helm install", but when that works, i want to do it through argocd
[22:53:56] <ap5> I want helm install to work first
[22:54:09] <ap5> Then i do it properly gitops style with argocd
[22:55:02] <Nasp> I was planning on doing our own helm chart style
[22:58:13] <Nasp> Or format rather

[23:05:58] <Nasp> Also nice
[23:06:02] <Nasp> I've bee nwanting to make a blog
[23:06:09] <Nasp> As notes for myself and others
[23:06:13] <Nasp> But sweet
[23:06:33] <ap5> I use hugo with org. It is built in gitlab and rsync'ed to my server
[23:06:55] <ap5> So i just commit and push, and rest is done automagically
[23:08:10] <ap5> And now it is defined in a helm chart as well xD
[23:09:20] <ap5> I actually think this setup is worth blogging about when i have set up argocd :D

[23:51:13] <Nasp> ap5:  What's your take on ip security?
[23:51:14] <brianonymous_> i was in the wiki, it was latin and the french and english slurped it up. but the US was like, fuck this shit.
[23:52:02] <ap5> Nasp, horizontal network security and boxing is actually quite hard in Azure. It is annoying.
[23:52:36] <ap5> Nasp, IPSec?
[23:53:31] <brianonymous_> in aws, you can essentially make services non-routable to the gateway
[23:55:01] <ap5> In Azure you can't really put something in a VNet unless you pay for it. It is annoying.
[23:55:38] <Nasp> ap5:  as in ip whitelist
[23:56:00] <brianonymous_> oh, so the option is there, its just pricey?
[23:56:12] <ap5> Yes
[23:56:51] <ap5> Nasp, it is a good part of s solution but you shouldn't rely on it as the only tool. See it as a part of securing.
[23:57:09] <Nasp> I would say it's rather useless
[23:57:58] <MatthiasVance> IOJETIUSRHGOIUHJ$TP(IUJE$INRGF
[23:58:31] <ap5> Nasp, if you only do whitelisting based on IPs, then yes
[23:58:35] <brianonymous_> MatthiasVance: orly
[23:58:50] <MatthiasVance> brianonymous_: Kind of, yeah.
[23:59:14] <Nasp> ap5:  Like internal services are just behind whitelist
[23:59:19] <Nasp> Which is open to almost everyone and their mom
[23:59:46] <ap5> If i had other options, i wouldn't use whitelisting
