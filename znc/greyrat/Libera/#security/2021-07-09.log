[04:33:59] <cedric> I am currently working on a project to manager security objects defined (and validated) with JSON schemas. Maybe it would be a good idea to add a JSON schema for the CVEs. I'll try to do that
[04:34:12] <cedric> here is the code: https://github.com/CASES-LU/MOSP
[04:35:16] <cedric> and an example of instance: https://objects.monarc.lu/ it contains some security standards, recommendations, etc. There are RSS feed. I think I'll add a JSON schema for the CVEs ;-)

[22:28:08] <NthDegree> Apachez, virtualbox just re-uses Windows Hypervisor Framework when WSL2 is in use
[22:28:11] <NthDegree> No nesting
[22:29:10] <ajak> it looks like virtualbox isn't running on windows though?
[22:30:29] <Apachez> depends on vm settings
[22:30:31] <NthDegree> ajak, the linked bug is for using virtualbox on Windows while WSL2 is installed
[22:30:39] <Apachez> most of the posts in that github are confusing
[22:30:46] <NthDegree> as in the beanbag- GitHub link
[22:30:57] <Apachez> first who is the host? how is the host configured? which vm engine is being used? how is that configured? etc
[22:31:36] <Apachez> in virtualbox there is the (per vm guest) system -> acceleration settings
[22:31:49] <Apachez> where you got "paravirtualization" along with "enable nested paging"
[22:31:58] <Apachez> that have been fun over the years
[22:32:11] <Apachez> so I wouldnt entirely blame microsoft on this even if it comes handy
[22:32:28] <NthDegree> Well the paravirt is not changing the engine
[22:32:50] <NthDegree> it's just changing what paravirt_ops are exposed as interfaces for the VMM to handle
[22:33:10] <Apachez> funny things have happend before when fiddling with those
