[15:33:21] <akronymus[m]> Emacs for IRC?
[15:33:25] <akronymus[m]> That's kinda amazing.
[15:36:09] <xeno> it's one of the few reasons to still use emacs. irc,email, usenet, text-only/mostly browsing and writing your own language modes 
[15:36:36] <xeno> as a regular editor it's IMO not the best option, but it's the best for implementing extensions 
[15:37:47] <biberu> so is there an emacs extension to make it the best editor?
[15:38:32] <akronymus[m]> biberu: https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil
[15:38:55] <biberu> nice
