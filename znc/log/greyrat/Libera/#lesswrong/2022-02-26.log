[00:44:50] <gwern> ...the same exact thing: they're just neurons. just stable dynamic patterns of neuron populations firing. perhaps, if you slow down nerve conduction, the dynamic stability is drastically affected and the memory capacity itself collapses. if my CPU is 2x slower, I can still run all my programs just slower; if my RAM suddenly halves (or worse?), then abruptly many of those programs may become...

[02:21:37] <quanticle> kuudes: Wow!
[02:23:18] <quanticle> "Based on these and earlier findings, we propose a model of the neural pathways for the regulation of shivering and non-shivering thermogenesis. Under warm environments (Fig. 2, left), warm-sensory signals from the skin ascend to the preoptic area and activate inhibitory projection neurons in the medial preoptic area, which tonically inhibit thermogenic signalling outflows. Under cool (or cold)
[02:23:20] <quanticle> environments (Fig. 2, right), cutaneous cool-sensory signals activate local inhibitory neurons in the median preoptic nucleus, which then reduce the activity of the inhibitory projection neurons in the medial preoptic area. In the case of infection, PGE2, which is produced in response to inflammatory cytokine signals, also inhibits the projection neurons in the medial preoptic area through the
[02:23:22] <quanticle> EP3 receptor."
[02:23:51] <quanticle> So it looks like there's a part of the brain that integrates temperature signals from skin sensors and uses that as a proxy for core temperature?
[02:24:43] <quanticle> It's a mouse study, but they did find that by injecting various inhibitors into that area of the brain, they could get mice to shiver and produce other thermogenic responses at will
[02:25:13] <ggreer> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preoptic_area hmm... if that's the case then do paralyzed people have issues thermoregulating?

[06:27:22] <PapuaHardyNet> okay so glorot initialization of weights of neural network layers is intended to minimize the introduction of shift of mean and variance of input to further layers, for each layer. This in turn prevents or reduces exploding / vanishing gradient problem when used with sigmoid activations
[06:29:01] <PapuaHardyNet> now, batchnorm authors claimed that as parameters in the network got updated, the weights of hidden layers caused a shift in mean and variance to inputs, which then created a cascading effect on deeper networks, which then had a detrimental effect on the training process. Now this is the same claim as the glorot claim, but takes into account the state of the neural network after the initialization
[06:31:17] <PapuaHardyNet> so now batchnorm was intended to *reduce* this effect by normalizing the means and variances of outputs of layers (specifically, outputs of FNN layers before they were fed into non-linear activations), but batchnorm was empirically shown to *increase* this cascading effect of shift in mean and variance to inputs
[06:32:30] <PapuaHardyNet> in fact, batchnorm is so good at causing this cascading effect, that for deep enough neural networks, it forces an exploding gradient, and this problem is only alleviated by the use of skip connections that send the original input or the output of early layers into deeper layers directly
[06:33:50] <PapuaHardyNet> but batchnorm empirically *does* improve the convergence rate compared to not using batchnorm. Does this mean that this cascading effect of shifting the mean and variance of the inputs to layers is not actually a problem for the neural network learning process? I'm unsure
[06:35:46] <PapuaHardyNet> now, newer papers have claimed that the *real* reason batchnorm improves the convergence rate is that it improves the Lipschitzness of the loss function and its gradient, and that other normalization methods (such as lp norm) will do the exact same thing without injecting so much complexity.
[06:37:06] <PapuaHardyNet> what this means is that the benefit of improving the Lipschitzness of the loss function and the gradient using some form of normalization has a significantly greater positive impact than the tendency of batchnorm to cause this cascading shifting mean/variance of inputs (and the resultant exploding gradient given deep enough networks and sigmoid activations)
[06:39:30] <PapuaHardyNet> the implication is simple: using normalization in layers (whether before the nonlinear activations or after is something that probably needs more research) has a significant benefit in training performance, and you should use some other normalization mechanism - layer norm, for example.
[06:40:26] <PapuaHardyNet> layer norm is interesting because I have no idea conceptually what it is doing. with batchnorm it is easy to understand the reasoning and why they did what they did. Layer norm seems like some arbitrary form of normalization to me, as of right now.

[08:31:17] <quanticle> A thread titled "Ukraine-Russia" where the majority of the posts are neither about Ukraine, nor Russia
[08:31:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Yeah, it's pretty amazing/terrible
[08:33:46] <quanticle> https://twitter.com/JimLaPorta/status/1497428052988641281
[08:33:48] <Robomot> James LaPorta (@JimLaPorta): "New @AP reporting tonight: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was asked to evacuate Kyiv at the behest of the U.S. government but turned down the offer. An American official tells me Zelenskyy said, “The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride.”" (http://n.hyperborea.cloud/pic/media%2FFMfu4IvWUAU8ghE.jpg)
[08:34:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Heh
[08:35:38] <adiabatic> "are the countries we live in as bad as Russia" the first and maybe second derivatives of the answer to this are way more interesting than the, uh, zeroth
[09:01:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Yes, like all things in life, it's a tradeoff. In the best case, dictatorships can deliver stability and, if not prosperity, then at least lack of starvation (on average). But the price you pay for having a population of people who do as they're told, is having a population of people who only do as they're told. Founding the next TikTok or Tesla is a huge risk, and it will make the prospective founder stick out -- and we all
[09:01:33] <Obormot\Arcturus>  know what happens to the nail that sticks out. For this reason, dictatorships tend to experience a lot of brain drain, as all the malcontents and the creative types and the intelligentsia and the risk-seekers flee to places where they have more freedom to succeed (or fail). The most common remedy for this is strict border control -- not to stop people coming in, but to stop them from leaving. The USSR was actually fairly
[09:01:33] <Obormot\Arcturus>  successful at it; North Korea is significantly more successful, and modern Russia is somewhere in the middle."
[09:01:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Heard a joke the other day:
[09:02:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> "If there is no water in the taps, then ... there are still some intelligent and educated people left in the country!"
[09:03:39] <PapuaHardyNet> I didn't get it. Does that mean that problems in society are being caused by "revolutionaries"?
[09:05:36] <saturn2> referring to the jews drinking all of the water?
[09:07:18] <kiboneu> the fremen?
[09:10:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Just so
[09:11:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: It's an old Russian antisemitic-slash-ironic verse (it rhymes in the original), that goes "If there's no water in the taps, then the Jews must've drunk it all!"
[09:12:53] <PapuaHardyNet> (read "antisemitic" as "antimemetic" at first) I see, I had no idea antisemitism was part of Russian history too
[09:13:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hah
[09:13:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Antisemitism is an age-old Russian tradition!
[09:13:23] <quanticle> Okay, I take back what I said above. I read that thread, and, uh... yeah, that "are our liberal democracies as authoritarian and oppressive as russia" is way worse than the Ukraine-Russia thread.
[09:13:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of course, it was (and is) much more well-developed in Ukraine
[09:13:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Which is why I have some degree of trouble joining all the "oh no the poor Ukrainians" handwringing)
[09:14:15] <quanticle> I never thought I'd say it, but that thread made me *want* to read Moldbug
[09:14:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Haha
[09:14:38] <quanticle> Because at least when Moldbug makes asinine points, he dresses them up in obscurantist historical references

[09:17:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Haha
[09:17:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah, for like 16-17 years
[09:18:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> He got to use the first punch card machines they installed, by the way
[09:18:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> To run economic planning calculations and what have you
[09:18:53] <quanticle> Kind of want to see a syllabus of one of his courses. Like, political-economy is the rough Marxist counterpart to our economics profession, so I'm really interested in seeing like... the mirror image bizarro world version of our economics departments
[09:19:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah, that'd be interesting to see. I don't think we brought any of that stuff with us though
[09:19:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Didn't seem too relevant
[09:19:48] <quanticle> Yeah, fair enough. I assume that if it came down to preserving old syllabi or having socks to wear, one would choose the socks.
[09:20:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Right. We did manage to get somewhat beyond "socks", but the threshold was at "which books do we save"
[09:21:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Old teaching materials definitely didn't rate
[09:21:29] <nshepperd2> democratic freedom is measured in tanks
[09:23:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Addendum 2 to that comment: one of my grandmother's friends, who came from the same small town in Ukraine that she grew up in, several years ago went back - I forget what the purpose of the trip was, but she ended up visiting the town... needless to say, no Jewish families left, no Jewish community, no synagogue, nothing - not even graves! Because the town had authorized construction on the sites of all the Jewish cemetaries)
[09:24:15] <PapuaHardyNet> wow. That's destruction of history.
[09:24:50] <PapuaHardyNet> also, hey nshepperd. hope your day is going well
[09:25:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes... so anyway, when I read this stuff about "our grandfathers fought the Nazis together!", I am less than impressed
[09:26:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> (As far as "destruction of history" goes, well, in one sense, you can't quite blame them for wanting to forget, can you? "Wow, all these Jewish names, and their dates of death all so close together, hmm, but what killed them? or who?" "Uhh... we did")

[09:51:20] <quanticle> Because apparently some VDV general just forgot that this wasn't 1944, and heck, even in 1944, airborne infantry assaults didn't have the greatest success rates
[09:53:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's hard to convey how highly-regarded VDV is, in Russia
[09:54:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> They have a very strong reputation as extreme badasses
[09:54:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> It would be embarrassing for them not to do this sort of thing
[09:55:04] <quanticle> Yeah, like the other tweet said, there's an element of gratuitousness here: the VDV has to do a risky airborne op, even when it makes no tactical sense, because, uh, that's what they do

[10:20:24] <PapuaHardyNet> I was thinking: what if we give standard IQ tests to language models?
[10:21:10] <saturn2> hasn't someone done that already?
[10:22:47] <saturn2> it would be amusing to replace grub with freedos+syslinux
[10:23:40] <PapuaHardyNet> this is the only link I found related to testing language models with IQ tests, and it does not fill me with confidence: https://lifearchitect.ai/iq-testing-ai/
[10:23:41] <Robomot> AI + IQ testing (human vs GPT-3 vs Jurassic-1) – Dr Alan D. Thompson – Life Architect (Note: While I would love to facilitate cognitive testing of current language models in 2021, nearly all popular IQ instruments would preclude testing of a ‘written word only’ language model; the most common instruments from Wechsler and Stanford-Binet require a test candidate who is using verbal, auditory, visual, and …)
[10:24:12] <quanticle> It's because language models replace wordcels, whereas IQ tests are for shape rotators
[10:24:15] <PapuaHardyNet> they also quote Conor in a very biased fashion, and call him the "creator of GPT-J", which he isn't, Ben Wang is
[10:25:04] <PapuaHardyNet> well, he and Aran are the ones who worked on it and should be cited, so clearly everything in this link is something we can ignore
[10:26:11] <PapuaHardyNet> lool, this website is garbage, there's no IQ test, they literally just used the word "IQ test" and cite standard NLP task perf
[10:28:46] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah I don't think standard IQ tests have been given to language models. Even so, I predict (just like quanticle says) that they'll underperform due to BPE interference

[18:24:37] <Robomot> How many troops has Russia sent into invasion of Ukraine? - AS.com (Estimates of the total number of Russian forces involved in the invasion of Ukraine vary but around 150,000 troops are thought to be deployed in total.)
[18:24:44] <two2thehead> kuudes, Now what would I do now, if I was a sneaky intelligence type? I'd get the ukrainians to, whenever safely possible blow up the Kadyrovtsy forces. Then, encourage some naughty person in Chechnya to perform a coup
[18:24:51] <capisce> "Ukraine’s military forces total 215,000 active personnel (of which 125,000 make up the permanent army) and 220,000 reservists, a figure that rises to almost 900,000 taking into account veterans and volunteer defence forces. Paramilitary security forces – the border guards and the National Guard – potentially add another 113,000 trained personnel to Ukraine’s defensive capabilities."
[18:25:21] <two2thehead> kuudes, 3:2? that's terrible
[18:25:39] <two2thehead> especially if UA is getting all their information from NATO/US
[18:25:40] <capisce> kuudes: source on draft?
[18:25:56] <kuudes> putin has air dominance, but not complete, ukraine fighter planes fly with us air tankers refuelling from poland and slovakia, and seem to have been able to drop putin planes, possibly because they look same and talk the same language
[18:26:01] <kuudes> no source, my hunch
[18:26:04] <kuudes> I could be wrong
[18:26:43] <PapuaHardyNet> source: "Trust me bro"
[18:26:49] <kuudes> indeed
[18:26:57] <kuudes> this is just my personal thinking
[18:27:32] <kuudes> like some young men are now fleeing russia quickly etc
[18:28:19] <kuudes> today has been a bad day for putin. but I expect there will come better days, and russia has not yet started massacring ukrainians

[18:31:28] <kuudes> yesterday there was that nato+swe+fin emergency meeting, and it seems to me 80% that sweden and finland are now interconnected to nato sensor imaging
[18:32:06] <kuudes> if finland and estonia both close airspace to russia, only the small international corridor connects st petersburg to kaliningrad
[18:32:51] <kuudes> and it is within international law to line finnish and estonian sea areas to touch each other, thereby closing that thing. but presumably russia would not like that
[18:33:17] <capisce> presumably
[18:33:43] <kuudes> before war, finnish+german+estonian ships went to the baltics and drew a line on the sea where presumably we would put the sea mines on, in case things happened
[18:34:04] <two2thehead> ..wat?
[18:34:36] <kuudes> well, german minelayers drove over the baltic to meet finnish minelayers. as their radar ponders are on, that draws a line to the tracking systems

[23:04:28] <feep> in other words, because we'd effectively formed a massive defensive alliance that spread by cultural conversion, our mere presence represented a shift in the strategy of empire for which they were ill-prepared

Some years back, a staffer from the Russian Presidential Administration recalled a story that Putin himself told about his childhood in the ruins of post-war Leningrad.

[23:49:48] <two2thehead> quanticle, that's my prior as well
[23:50:55] <quanticle> IIRC there were four bombs that went off, and a fifth one that didn't. The police found a set of alleged perpetrators who planted that bomb, and after arresting them, the FSB called them up and told the police to let them go.
[23:51:18] <quanticle> And made it clear to both the police and the residents that further questions would not be appreciated
[23:53:12] <quanticle> And they put out some statement saying that the bomb was "just an exercise" or something
[23:53:24] <two2thehead> quanticle, you mean contrary to the 'cruel russian' stereotype, russian law enforcement don't like it when people blow up their neighborhood? :thinking_face:
