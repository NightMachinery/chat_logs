[13:04:58] <lep> mostly FreeBSD i feel
[13:05:06] <lep> which is fine as i use fbsd
[13:05:12] <lep> but openbsd is also very nice
[13:05:21] <lep> they do some nice things, like having an own ldapd in base
[13:06:01] <lep> which i also use
[13:06:26] <lep> unfortunately their httpd in base is a bit too limited for my usecases
[13:07:15] <pe> I never had any success with FreeBSD, randomly crapping up and otherwise unlikable.
[13:07:38] <lep> i have the same fbsd box running now for probably over 10 years
[13:09:50] <allana> bsandro: Thanks for the tip. Would anyone here be willing to vouch for me if I share those things?
