[03:47:07] <Cecen> C# seriously needs const, preventing accidental modifications in large object graphs is a nightmare
[04:00:25] <Suchiman> Cecen: use immutable design (TM), records for example
[04:01:36] <Cecen> That doesn't work for game worlds
[04:02:45] <Suchiman> Cecen: how is it different from const? or readonly
[04:02:48] <Cecen> I have a huge object graph representing a world being modified at frequent intervals, which is a time-sensitive process. Other things (AI, players, etc.) apply actions that modify the world, but figuring out what those actions are often requires inspecting the world state
[04:03:34] <Cecen> C++ const effectively allows you to make anything (and all of its members) read-only, without needing to introduce adaptors
[04:04:11] <Cecen> In this case, the world is a massive object graph consisting of hundreds of types and often collections. It's not feasible to maintain adaptors (or interfaces for things that don't need to wrap a member) for every type
[04:05:13] <Suchiman> Cecen: so you can have LinkedList<A> data = new()...; const LinkedList<A> readonlyVersion = data; and the compiler won't let you change anything descending from readonlyVersion?
[04:05:53] <Cecen> That's right

[04:15:59] <jonp> though that's on a per-type basis, so certainly not as flexible as C++ `const`
[04:18:17] <Cecen> Yeah, these things are changing very frequently. I only need a read-only view for certain things
[04:18:46] <jonp> then create a `ReadOnlyWhatever` type?
[04:18:54] <Cecen> There are hundreds of types, often with collections. It's not maintainable.
[04:19:58] <jonp> is it worse than Roslyn?
[04:23:30] <Cecen> Aren't the majority of Roslyn's types immutable?
[04:24:06] <jonp> externally, perhaps, but not necessarily internally: https://ericlippert.com/2012/06/08/red-green-trees/
[04:24:31] <Cecen> Roslyn is a completely different use case, it basically just build the data once.

[10:21:48] <jmer> _genuser_: yes. It's usually the game that controls the resolution
[10:21:49] <_genuser_> jmer: I went to the game settings and that max it would do was 1920x1080. With the other card the max it would do is 2560x1440.
[10:21:53] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: i wish
[10:22:01] <jmer> _genuser_: sometimes games don't register the correct max resolution.
[10:22:16] <MatthiasVance> awh
[10:22:17] <jmer> _genuser_: did you remove the old gfx drivers?
[10:22:36] <jmer> _genuser_: there are also some games that max out at 1920x1080
[10:22:42] <jmer> they are luckily rare.
[10:22:50] <_genuser_> jmer: why would I uninstall drivers? you mean people don't hoarde software like they do stuff?

[10:23:13] <jmer> _genuser_: when getting a new graphics card it's a good idea to reinstall your gfx drivers :)
[10:23:29] <JakeSays> one thing that is lacking on linux is a good email client
[10:23:30] <_genuser_> jmer: hehe, no this game does support higher. But I did install new driver and rebooted a few times. I might uninstall the other driver tomorrow. I wasn't sure if I was gonna replace the old one back in or not. So I didn't want to uninstall the drivers.
[10:23:30] <jmer> even if it's the same manufacturer

[10:36:55] <JakeSays> _genuser_: very flexible hours, no deadlines.
[10:37:01] <JakeSays> a bit boring
[10:37:51] <jmer> I moved away from gentoo because I got annoyed any kernel change would give me 5-6 hours of internet down time
[10:38:00] <jmer> I was using it for my internet router
[10:38:16] <jmer> actually not just kernel changes, but ANY changes to the system xD
[10:40:47] <JakeSays> i installed mint on a laptop. seems nice enough

[10:44:22] <jmer> _genuser_: no... I know how it's supposed to be said, it was the written form I struggled with
[10:44:45] <JakeSays> joke's == joke is
[10:44:45] <_genuser_> unless of course it's ukraine. Then we'd rather just hand-wring.

[10:48:32] <_genuser_> oh lol, I didn't even see the channel name. I just picked the first one with the smallest time frame.
[10:48:57] <JakeSays> i don't see the joke

[10:49:23] <JakeSays> _genuser_: look at the last frame of the video
[10:49:45] <_genuser_> the joke was she didnt know how to handle the quesiton so just laughed it off as a useless comment. Ulimately laughing at a comment about refugees.
[10:50:37] <_genuser_> JakeSays: I don't bring it up for any political reasons. I just remember because we just talked about american slang and it remind me of another "slang" or "saying". It's more an english saying and not america specific.
[10:51:05] <JakeSays> _genuser_: no, that's not what she did. the reporter asked both of them a question, and she deferred to the president of the host country to answer first, which he didn't.
[10:52:27] <JakeSays> that's actually the first VPOTUS video i've ever watched. i never pay attention to #2. they're always useless.
[10:52:34] <_genuser_> JakeSays: imo, she didn't even understand the super long question. deferring or not is secondary. Obama OR Tump either would have at least touched on policy.
[10:53:11] <_genuser_> you're right though. I never watched vp vids. Or any of the talks. I was always surprised by people asking me about waht trump said, because I would never have watched it. Or even with Biden.
[10:53:22] <_genuser_> heck I'm daytrading sometimes and I don't even have an idea what jpowell is saying.
[10:53:27] <JakeSays> dude she didn't even answer the question. you can't pass judgment on the quality of the answer if there isn't one
[10:54:12] <JakeSays> well, she didn't answer the question in that 68 second clip.
[10:54:36] <JakeSays> context people. context.
[10:54:42] <_genuser_> I thought the joke was how she handled the question. (by not answering and laughing it off).

[10:55:16] <_genuser_> imo, not a super important issue. I don't really care to make fun of her response or to make people think the response was this or that.
[10:55:26] <_genuser_> just funny to me. I pointed it out. Now we can move on. lol.
[10:55:33] <JakeSays> well, it's a 68 second breitbart clip framed to make her look bad. based solely on that clip we don't know what her real answer was
[10:55:48] <JakeSays> in other words, it's typical media bullshit
[10:56:03] <_genuser_> oh dude you're so innocent.
[10:56:10] <_genuser_> this can't make her look bad.
[10:56:22] <_genuser_> if you ever saw her behavior on cspan as a congressperson, she can manage that on her own.
[10:56:29] <_genuser_> like most of them. lol
[10:56:31] <JakeSays> i'm not innocent. i see right through the video
[10:56:56] <JakeSays> _genuser_: i'm not defending her. i'm attacking the premise of the clip.
[10:56:59] <_genuser_> the only congressperson I don't laugh at is cornyn.

[10:58:02] <_genuser_> he didn't help himself with that mexico trip during the blackout though.
[10:58:29] <JakeSays> i have developed a strategy for handling the modern media: if verifiable facts are not presented, it's useless.
[10:59:15] <maroon> even then you can't trust that there's stuff they're hiding because it makes their guy look bad, or makes the other side look good
[10:59:47] <jmer> JakeSays: I try to use the same strategy but verifiying facts is getting increasingly hard. i.e. in the past couple of years there have been several examples of universities doing politically colored research... Thse guys used to be trustworthy but no longer :/
[11:00:16] <JakeSays> maroon: that's not an issue for me. i can weigh the facts on their own merits, and do further research if needed.

[11:06:43] <_genuser_> won't argue with that.
[11:06:46] <maroon> like when the duke lacrosse players were made to look good for raping that stripper, even though the DA had hidden evidence that showed there was video showing one of the defendants at an ATM at the time when the accuser claimed he was one of several people busy raping her. the player looked guilty only because of the limited facts released
[11:07:30] <_genuser_> lol the duke fiasco was horrible. And yet people keep saying all victims should be believed without facts.
[11:07:41] <_genuser_> I think all victims should be believed to launch an investigation.
[11:07:58] <_genuser_> punishing should wait until fact are out / investigation is complete.
[11:08:37] <_genuser_> JakeSays: market news, I did read that putin had agreed to end fighting. And ukraine had agreed to give up areas wanting freedom and give up nato membership ambition.
[11:09:17] <JakeSays> maroon: exactly. if you judge that situation solely on unverified information presented by the defendant, then the atm footage is indeed exculpatory.
[11:09:33] <JakeSays> _genuser_: wut?
[11:10:06] <_genuser_>  JakeSays that was the market news in my trading groups that ukraine had agreed to the main terms by russia in order to end the war. I figured it was good enough information.
[11:10:11] <_genuser_> now you're making me think that wasn't accurate.
[11:10:40] <JakeSays> maroon: my point is, i attempt to hold off forming conclusions until i have verified facts in hand.
[11:11:01] <JakeSays> _genuser_: that isn't even remotely accurate

[11:13:17] <jmer> Even if they manage to end the war I think  Putin has managed to fuck his country over for many years ahead... No one will trust them for a very long time.
[11:13:25] <JakeSays> wow. how the hell do you go from that phrase to zelensky agreeing to russia's terms?
[11:14:08] <maroon> i go to wikipedia for all my unbiased needs
[11:14:08] <JakeSays> _genuser_: there is no indication that it is going to end soon

[11:14:23] <jmer> (I mean here in Denmark)
[11:14:41] <_genuser_> JakeSays: true that. depends on how that meeting goes. Or if Putin even agrees to meet with Zelenskyy

[11:45:38] <JakeSays> _genuser_: totally
[11:45:49] <MatthiasVance> MaNa2k: No, Git functionality is included in VS Code
[11:45:52] <_genuser_> JakeSays: heh, I've been at this task for a while. just runs monotonous.
[11:45:54] <JakeSays> the only thing more boring than writing tests is fixing broke tests
[11:46:04] <MatthiasVance> MaNa2k: If this is a new developer why don't they use the same as you are using?
[11:46:11] <_genuser_> at least I'm starting to like dapper now.
[11:46:33] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, well its actually a few-corses developer
[11:46:43] <MaNa2k> not a fully fledged
[11:47:02] <MaNa2k> he just did some online courses, and knows how to do some basic stuff
[11:47:22] <JakeSays> MaNa2k: tell him to do an online git course
[11:47:36] <JakeSays> he needs to know the tools of his trade
[11:47:39] <_genuser_> wow the develop-ism is strong. MaNa2k be nice!
[11:48:15] <MaNa2k> lol
[11:48:37] <MatthiasVance> MaNa2k: Yeah but then .. why not give them the same tooling?
[11:48:42] <MatthiasVance> So they can tag along?
[11:48:48] <MatthiasVance> Now you have double the work
[11:49:02] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, well hes a php developer, and we do c#
[11:49:07] <MatthiasVance> ahhh
[11:49:08] <MatthiasVance> okay
[11:49:17] <MatthiasVance> And they wanted to use VS Code?
[11:49:23] <MatthiasVance> You'd think they want PhpStorm
[11:49:26] <MaNa2k> and i dont think we got any more vspro licences anyhow
[11:49:35] <_genuser_> vscode is fine. just open a vscode terminal.
[11:49:47] <_genuser_> and git status; git add . ; git commit -m ""; blah blah.
[11:49:51] <JakeSays> MaNa2k: you hired a dev w/o buying licenses?
[11:50:08] <_genuser_> JakeSays: lol you mean think companies don't do that?
[11:50:10] <MatthiasVance> That's how you "save money", right JakeSays
[11:50:11] <MatthiasVance> ;p
[11:50:12] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, dosnt want to use vscode, has used vscode, and also made some working function apps i think, now he just want to backup the code to our git devops
[11:51:01] <MaNa2k> JakeSays, hes actually a teamlead\consultant who happened to aslo know some coding
[11:51:05] <_genuser_> imo have him just download a sample .gitignore for his language. And then just create a repo. and push it out manually if you just want a one-time backup.
[11:51:20] <MaNa2k> we use him sometimes when we got too much on our hands
[11:51:24] <JakeSays> MaNa2k: team lead? over what kind of team?
[11:51:42] <MaNa2k> actaully, thats projectleader
[11:51:43] <_genuser_> JakeSays: sounds like middle management decided to be a dev so he wouldn't be obsolete,.
[11:51:58] <MaNa2k> our us coders, he will in a year or so take over someone elses role
[11:52:00] <JakeSays> MaNa2k: ah that makes more sense

[12:00:37] <MatthiasVance> Sure but you can set one up and then just hand out the repo url right?
[12:00:38] <_genuser_> so you have people skills.
[12:00:39] <MaNa2k> next step is to connect it to vscode
[12:01:22] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, sure, i guess i could do that, but i need to learn him how to. and it would be nice to know the other bit too

[12:20:36] <JakeSays> for me the issue with digital whiteboards is lack of a drawing surface
[12:21:01] <jmer> JakeSays: the surface hubs have this kind of concept. It's pretty neat but I still think they are overpriced considdering what they are
[12:21:41] <JakeSays> yes, but they're designed to be an actual physical whiteboard
[12:22:10] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: I agree @ lack of drawing surface
[12:22:11] <jmer> Yes but there's nothing that would prevent you from scaling down the concept to a small(er) screen?

[12:22:34] <jmer> I might not be using the correct name they changed it a couple of times
[12:22:50] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: ah could be. i'm not familiar with ms whiteboard
[12:23:04] <jmer> MatthiasVance: the times I tried using MS Whiteboard it failed miserably

[13:42:39] <Tobbi_> Sudoku :D
[13:42:46] <jmer> or just participate in social events that focus on things you like
[13:42:47] <MatthiasVance> Sudoku partner, yeah that works!
[13:42:55] <MatthiasVance> Sudoku club!
[13:42:57] <Tobbi_> wifi connection app ahahaha
[13:42:58] <JakeSays> was just about to sign an new rental lease and discovered that they had removed the pet allowance.
[13:43:07] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: :o
[13:43:10] <Tobbi_> My dating will be like: "Hey, I got wifi" - "Hey, me too"
[13:43:12] <Tobbi_> :D
[13:43:14] <Tobbi_> Instant couple.
[13:43:15] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: So what's next?
[13:43:24] <jmer> but yeah... as a guy who primarily went to schools with a majority of guys and very nerdy almost "guy only" interests, dating apps can be a big help in getting exposure to the opposite sex (or the same if that's the way you swing)
[13:43:37] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: i'm sure it was just an oversight, but i won't sign until it's fixed.
[13:43:38] <Tobbi_> getting exposure isn't the problem for me.
[13:43:44] <jmer> JakeSays: I'm pretty sure women don't count as pets
[13:43:51] <Tobbi_> The problem for me is getting the courage to ask the s/o out
[13:43:57] <Tobbi_> jmer: Depends ;)
[13:44:12] <MatthiasVance> Tobbi_: You don't have to ask anyone out
[13:44:13] <JakeSays> jmer: why don't you ask yours to make sure
[13:44:17] <MatthiasVance> Tobbi_: Just chat with someone you like
[13:44:28] <jmer> Tobbi_: the whole point is that you can chat and get a feel for each other before you "ask her out"
[13:44:41] <MatthiasVance> Yeah if you had a good chat you can ask if they want to do it again
[13:44:43] <JakeSays> get a feel before you cop a feel
[13:44:48] <Tobbi_> I'm constantly dealing with my own issues.
[13:44:50] <jmer> JakeSays: lol...
[13:44:55] <jmer> Tobbi_: welcome to life
[13:45:01] <Tobbi_> I haven't been in a good mood in quite a long time because of that.
[13:45:19] <Tobbi_> heh.
[13:45:31] <jmer> JakeSays: should I ask the pets or the wife?
[13:45:43] <Tobbi_> I also often have this intense feeling that people don't like me....which can be a hindrance.
[13:45:48] <Tobbi_> Even though it's not based on reality.
[13:45:53] <MatthiasVance> Tobbi_: Cognitive therapy can help with that
[13:45:55] <JakeSays> jmer: the wife. duh
[13:46:22] <Tobbi_> Same with my catastrophic thinking
[13:46:24] <Tobbi_> I guess
[13:46:29] <MatthiasVance> Tobbi_: Yes
[13:46:38] <MatthiasVance> Tobbi_: With cognitive therapy you can learn to see the difference
[13:46:47] <MatthiasVance> Are you already doing such a thing?
[13:46:58] <Tobbi_> CBT? no.
[13:47:11] <Tobbi_> Going to a therapist's office is a bit difficult here
[13:47:28] <MatthiasVance> Why is that? Sorry I forgot
[13:47:29] <JakeSays> you can do it remotely
[13:47:38] <Tobbi_> Getting an appointment is difficult here
[13:47:42] <MatthiasVance> Why is that?
[13:47:43] <Tobbi_> Because you have to wait a long time
[13:47:48] <Tobbi_> therapists are overrun
[13:47:50] <JakeSays> where is here?
[13:47:53] <Tobbi_> Germany
[13:48:07] <JakeSays> ah. Suchiman will be your therapist
[13:48:11] <Tobbi_> Oh no
[13:48:13] <MatthiasVance> Tobbi_: Do you have an appointment set yet for in a long time then?
[13:48:14] <Tobbi_> I'm doomed
[13:48:16] <JakeSays> LOL
[13:48:20] <jmer> Tobbi_: you can work with these issues without a therapist
[13:48:32] <Tobbi_> MatthiasVance: I *tried* once...a couple years ago... I am also scared of therapists...
[13:48:43] <Tobbi_> because we might venture into territory I do not like to venture into
[13:48:44] <JakeSays> the good ones don't bite
[13:48:47] <jmer> a therapist is certainly a help, but it's not an excuse to do nothing
[13:49:26] <Suchiman> Tobbi_: don't worry, we're all doomed

[13:49:58] <MatthiasVance> Only 60 EUR though?
[13:50:11] <Suchiman> MatthiasVance: first day discount
[13:50:13] <MatthiasVance> ohh
[13:50:14] <Tobbi_> very expensive for a hobo who just learned how to not slur their words
[13:50:45] <Tobbi_> MatthiasVance: Venturing into how I chose the wrong career and will probably have to start over *is* a bad idea.
[13:50:58] <Tobbi_> I am trying to deflect that reality from me.
[13:51:09] <JakeSays> Tobbi_: what career id you choose?
[13:51:16] <Tobbi_> This one...programming
[13:51:17] <MatthiasVance> Tobbi_: Oh sorry I meant that group therapy is not a bad idea. And deflecting things longer and longer might make problems worse of course...
[13:51:23] <JakeSays> Tobbi_: how old are you
[13:51:24] <Tobbi_> I know that.
[13:51:25] <Tobbi_> 33
[13:51:28] <JakeSays> bah
[13:51:43] <JakeSays> making a career change at 33 isn't a big deal
[13:51:56] <MatthiasVance> No but starting over while feeling insecure already is
[13:52:00] <Tobbi_> yes.
[13:52:01] <JakeSays> indeed
[13:52:22] <JakeSays> Tobbi_: so programming doesn't agree with you?
[13:52:34] <Tobbi_> That is a good question.
[13:52:57] <JakeSays> is it actual programming, or the environment/people, etc?
[13:53:03] <Tobbi_> I enjoy the thinking about and conceptualizing part.
[13:53:07] <Tobbi_> Not so much the programming part
[13:53:26] <JakeSays> be an architect then
[13:53:29] <Tobbi_> I'm very creative when it comes to conceptualizing...and finding the best possible match for something
[13:53:37] <Tobbi_> Not sure if I'd be a good architect though
[13:53:41] <JakeSays> why?
[13:53:49] <Tobbi_> I have no former training in that
[13:53:55] <JakeSays> you don't need any
[13:53:56] <MatthiasVance> Tobbi_: I have no formal training in anything
[13:54:11] <MatthiasVance> Doesn't hold me back
[13:54:17] <Tobbi_> No apprenticeship?
[13:54:19] <MatthiasVance> no
[13:54:26] <JakeSays> same
[13:54:28] <Tobbi_> never went to school?
[13:54:32] <JakeSays> nope
[13:54:34] <MatthiasVance> didn't get a degree
[13:54:41] <MatthiasVance> I just started working

[13:54:49] <JakeSays> well, not successfully. i went 5 times and never made it a semester
[13:55:18] <MatthiasVance> Tobbi_: First I did PHP/VB because that's what I knew, then moved on to C# and now F#
[13:55:37] <Tobbi_> PHP and VB, two languages that suck.
[13:55:46] <JakeSays> Tobbi_: MatthiasVance thinks he's special now that he knows f#33333333
[13:55:50] <JakeSays> bah
[13:56:03] <Tobbi_> :D
[13:56:04] <MatthiasVance> No I think I'm special period and so should you think of yourself ;)

[13:56:32] <MatthiasVance> Tobbi_: So you don't need to worry about not having a formal background
[13:56:58] <MatthiasVance> Tobbi_: Also what is the reason you don't like the programming part?
[13:57:08] <Tobbi_> That is a good question.
[13:57:08] <MatthiasVance> Might also be job related
[13:57:21] <MatthiasVance> How many programming jobs have you had?
[13:57:29] <Tobbi_> well,...
[13:57:38] <Tobbi_> I first worked for a horrible, horrible company...as a student worker.
[13:57:42] *** Quits: vim_fans (~pi@user/vim-fans/x-3284168) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[13:57:47] <Tobbi_> that went on for IDK 9 months.
[13:57:59] <Tobbi_> then I worked for a horrible, horrible startup as a web dev.
[13:58:05] <Tobbi_> that went on for like 1.5 months
[13:58:23] <Tobbi_> And now I've been working for this much less horrible company...
[13:58:30] <Tobbi_> for 4 years and counting
[13:58:45] <Tobbi_> Oh, yeah, also I've been a Mozilla intern 10 years ago
[13:58:48] <Tobbi_> 11 years ago
[13:58:49] <Tobbi_> whatever
[13:58:55] <Tobbi_> But that was only 3 months
[13:59:15] <MatthiasVance> Maybe.. it's time to focus on what would make you happy?
[13:59:25] <MatthiasVance> Instead of letting job environment dictate it
[13:59:30] <MatthiasVance> Tech market is super hot
[13:59:52] <Tobbi_> And limited in my area and I don't want to move.
[14:00:00] <MatthiasVance> Tobbi_: Remote working?
[14:00:09] <Tobbi_> Maybe.
[14:00:15] <Tobbi_> comes with its own obstacles, though
[14:00:27] <MatthiasVance> Sure
[14:00:35] <MatthiasVance> You own your working environment though :D
[14:00:43] <Tobbi_> :D true
[14:00:58] <Tobbi_> You guys should do wordle, by the way.
[14:01:01] <Tobbi_> So we can compare scores.
[14:01:02] <MatthiasVance> no
[14:01:05] <Tobbi_> No?
[14:01:06] <Tobbi_> :D
[14:01:07] <MatthiasVance> I muted that word on twitter

[14:02:15] * jmer sighs...
[14:02:22] <Tobbi_> bar too low?

[14:02:34] <jmer> wth
[14:02:36] <MatthiasVance> Tobbi_: So, will you be doing anything differently in 3 months?
[14:02:43] <Tobbi_> MatthiasVance: Knowing me, probably not.
[14:02:53] <Tobbi_> But I'll try to tackle my own personal problems that I have on the side of  this job.
[14:03:00] <Tobbi_> And see if having tackled them makes any difference.
[14:03:11] <MatthiasVance> Tobbi_: I can help you with anything job related just let me know what you want
[14:03:26] <Tobbi_> Remote job?
[14:03:46] <MatthiasVance> An actual job or advice on how to proceed / where to look / what to say / how to make a list of what you find important
[14:03:56] <Tobbi_> Thanks for the offer!
[14:04:10] <jmer> Tobbi_: I think you should stop coming up with bad excuses to stay passive and then actually do something about your issues ;)
[14:04:20] <Tobbi_> jmer: You are right, I should...
[14:04:33] <MatthiasVance> Tobbi_: No problem at all, I know it can be hard to break out of such a circle and it might help to have at least one person in your corner :D
[14:04:34] <Tobbi_> I completely agree there.
[14:05:21] <jmer> Tobbi_: there's a bright point of having hit rock bottom; It can only get better from there :D
[14:05:30] <Tobbi_> I'm far, far away from rock bottom.
[14:05:34] <Tobbi_> :D
[14:06:05] <Tobbi_> Maybe pop bottom? :D
[14:06:17] <Tobbi_> No, in all honesty: It can get so much worse.
[14:06:24] <Tobbi_> But let's not venture there
[14:06:25] <MatthiasVance> But it can also get so much better!
[14:06:47] <MatthiasVance> The "funny" thing is, that is 1 decision away
[14:06:53] <Tobbi_> toss of a coin.
[14:06:55] <MatthiasVance> No
[14:06:58] <MatthiasVance> That's a lie
[14:07:01] <Tobbi_> I know.
[14:07:05] <Tobbi_> I wasn't being serious.
[14:07:40] <MatthiasVance> Or were you?
[14:07:46] <Tobbi_> No, I wasn't.
[14:08:10] <Tobbi_> I envy people who can just deal with bullshit jobs every day, get their 80k euros and not question anything in their lives.
[14:08:18] <Tobbi_> I'm far far away from that.
[14:08:25] <MatthiasVance> Stop being in a bullshit job
[14:08:29] <MatthiasVance> And keep question everything
[14:08:32] <MatthiasVance> *questioning
[14:08:33] <MatthiasVance> :D
[14:08:37] <Tobbi_> lol
[14:09:00] <MatthiasVance> The only question you need to start asking is "Does this make me happy?"
[14:10:00] <Tobbi_> Maybe painting art would make me happy 24/7
[14:10:03] <Tobbi_> lol
[14:10:08] <MatthiasVance> Do it
[14:10:14] <Tobbi_> You can't live like that.
[14:10:25] <MatthiasVance> You can start painting art 1 day of the week though
[14:10:25] <Tobbi_> It's your one way ticket to bankruptcy
[14:10:29] <MatthiasVance> It's not all or nothing
[14:10:34] <JakeSays> Tobbi_: then do it 3 hrs a day
[14:10:41] <Tobbi_> that is true. but it was more of a metaphorical answer.
[14:11:09] <JakeSays> in this group therapy session metaphors are not allowed
[14:11:17] <Tobbi_> Oh damn
[14:11:23] <JakeSays> well, reverse-group session. multiple therapists, one patient
[14:11:32] <Tobbi_> By the way: Did I start this again?
[14:11:34] <Tobbi_> let me scroll back
[14:11:38] <JakeSays> start what
[14:11:47] <MatthiasVance> Tobbi_: #freetobbi
[14:11:52] <JakeSays> lol
[14:12:13] <Tobbi_> Start the group therapy session.
[14:12:20] <Tobbi_> And I "kinda" did
[14:12:25] <Tobbi_> by mentioning my relationship status
[14:12:29] <Tobbi_> :D
[14:12:32] <Tobbi_> I'm gonna stop now.
[14:12:36] <Tobbi_> Maybe play some games.
[14:12:40] <MatthiasVance> What are you playing?
[14:12:43] <JakeSays> jmer's penis obsession kinda forced us all in to therapy
[14:12:46] <jmer> Tobbi_: to put it short, you started whining, we started feeling bad for you... Offering moral support... :P
[14:12:53] <Tobbi_> the usual, either poker or this racing game.
[14:12:59] <Tobbi_> Or this jump'n'run
[14:13:04] <Tobbi_> jmer: And I appreciate that.
[14:13:08] <jmer> JakeSays: All guys are obsessed with at least 1 penis
[14:13:29] <Tobbi_> While not being as effective as an in-person therapy session, it at least helps to alleviate some of my feelings
[14:13:43] <JakeSays> i do not obsess. my penis is a tool and i use it to great satisfaction
[14:14:10] <Tobbi_> Since when does a rubber doll feel satisfaction? :P
[14:14:24] <jmer> Tobbi_: LOL
[14:14:29] <jmer> burn!

[20:24:50] <Ownix> I wanted to avoid using the console generic host + a background task with UseConsoleLifetime, because historically i have found it to be way more complicated for a simple one-and-done CLI tool. And now im encountering an issue where i have no real way to shut down the host.
[20:26:15] <jonp> Ownix: Console.ReadLine()?
[20:26:39] <Ownix> jonp: I have that, but then I also need to signal a shutdown based on some external event in the app
[20:26:42] <jonp> in which case the "event" is "typing the enter key"
[20:26:43] <DevJohnC> use a TaskCompletionSource
[20:27:33] <Suchiman> Ownix: ManualResetEvent
[20:27:43] <DevJohnC> your Main waits on the Task member of the TCS, your other logic that's monitoring for the exit signal sets the result on TCS when signal is received

[20:34:14] <Ownix> Suchiman: that worked great, the initialState, and Set/Reset is confusing nomenclature.
[20:34:59] <Ownix> ctrl+c still kills the app abruptly, which is fine for now, but I may want to trap that and propagate it through my app to allow a graceful cleanup
[20:36:09] <Ownix> Maybe I should just do a background task. At this point, I feel like im reinventing the wheel of the GenericHost + UseConsoleLifetime().
[20:36:34] <Ownix> The background tasks get cancellation tokens (in confusing ways), and then have lifecycle hooks on AppicationHost or whatever its called.
[20:37:00] <Suchiman> Ownix: even when you subscribe to Console.CancelKeyPress ?
[20:37:22] <MatthiasVance> Ownix: When you say "background task", I'm assuming you don't mean a Hosted Service?

[20:54:00] <Ownix> Suchiman: Is there a way to satisfy this requirement? Whats the alternative to an async lambda? https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/yQwc5ok1/image.png
[20:55:01] <Suchiman> Ownix: none, OnStepErrorAsync? xD
[20:55:15] <Ownix> Suchiman: https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/SoccE1Nh/image.png
[20:55:26] <Ownix> Suchiman: Right, I suppose i can create a PR or GH Issue and ask for that
[21:00:30] <Suchiman> Ownix: that second version just ignores whatever happens to StopAsync so not sure if that is really better than the first one :P
[21:01:00] <Ownix> Damng, so im up a tree on this one without proper support for async by the library?
[21:01:20] <Suchiman> Ownix: yep
[21:02:14] <Suchiman> Ownix: i mean i suppose you could do StopAsync(...).ContinueWith(... log any exceptions)
[21:02:46] <Suchiman> Ownix: but then you can also just go the async way again, making sure to catch whatever StopAsync might throw
[21:03:02] <Suchiman> Ownix: just mind that the host will not wait for that last bit to happen before resuming
[21:05:11] <Ownix> Yeah I might go that route, if the StopAsync throws, shit has hit the fan and I probably just want to see a stack trace in the logs and debug
[21:05:28] <Ownix> Theres only so much you can try/catch before you simply have bugs in your code or a dependency
[21:09:39] <silly> i now ./configure from linux and npm install from node.js, is there something similar in c# development to initialize the environment after cloning a repo?
[21:09:46] <silly> i *know
[21:09:55] <jonp> silly: `msbuild /restore YourApp.sln`
[21:10:00] <jonp> and/or `nuget restore`
[21:10:08] <silly> awesome ty
[21:10:08] <Ownix> silly: dotnet core?
[21:10:14] <jonp> but `msbuild /restore` calls `nuget restore`, and `dotnet build` implicitly does a NuGet restore

[23:51:45] <ern> positive on the other hand...
