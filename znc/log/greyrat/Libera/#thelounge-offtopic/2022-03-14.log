[23:01:29] <kinghat> i had pushed all my commits to my branch on origin but locally i squashed, now it wants to push my squash and pull the 13 previous commits, is there where i need to just force push vs pushing and pulling the things ive already squashed?
[23:03:46] <kinghat> this*
[23:04:38] <bookworm> kinghat: just force push assuming your local branch is what you want as an end result
[23:04:47] <kinghat> ya it is
