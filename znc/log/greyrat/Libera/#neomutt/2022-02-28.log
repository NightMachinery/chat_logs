[15:02:49] <gour> in order to have non-folder based setup, i believe i can use different accounts - sourced and folder-hooks, but design my own sidebar by using (notmuch's) virtual-mailboxes?
[15:03:30] <flatcap> er, ok, good :-)
[15:11:47] * flatcap feels a long discussion coming on
[15:12:26] <gour> 😄
[15:13:10] <gour> is new release around the corner?
[15:13:23] <flatcap> getting close
[15:13:38] <flatcap> I've got one last (large) thing I want to resolve...
[15:13:57] <flatcap> and my experiments, over the last few days, have worked out
[15:14:23] <gour> just wonder how quickly will debian's sid get it
[15:14:43] * flatcap doesn't understand the Debian Way (tm)
[15:15:31] <flatcap> at the heart of Mutt is the MENU, which is basically an on-screen list
[15:16:03] <flatcap> but it's involved in the event loop, because Mutt is poorly designed, and it controls the painting of the entire app
[15:16:19] <flatcap> I _think_ I can break it up
[15:16:49] <gour> now i'm using (again) gnome, btrfs...could easily be on fedora, although i'm more familiar with debian
[15:17:05] * flatcap uses Fedora
[15:17:06] <gour> flatcap: how ca nyou manage still to still keep neomutt "in sync" ?
[15:17:18] <flatcap> it's pretty stable and it's got the latest shiny toys :-)
[15:17:48] <flatcap> with upstream?  I can't.  it's a real pain
[15:18:26] <gour> flatcap: are you happy with 'upgrades'? that could save me to play with potential sid's instabilities since regular debian is way too old
[15:18:46] <gour> flatcap: will neomutt diverge at some point of time?
[15:18:46] <flatcap> but to move forward, we NEED to fix the major architectural problems
[15:19:04] <flatcap> hehe, that ship has sailed...
[15:19:25] <flatcap> we're compatible at a config level, but the code has diverged a lot
[15:20:04] <gour> any estimation about the percentage of current mutt vs neomutt users?
[15:20:36] <flatcap> I'd love to know.  mutt will certainly have more.  it's in every distro
[15:21:38] <flatcap> I'd like to get it into the RedHat distros, but there are SO MANY hoops to jump through
[15:21:56] <flatcap> (so I self-publish)
[15:23:00] * flatcap peeks in #mutt
[15:23:07] <flatcap> but we've got more people on IRC :-)
[15:23:18] <gour> ubuntu-ones are covered?
[15:23:38] <flatcap> yes, because they're backed by Debian
[15:23:51] <flatcap> I have no idea how old the NeoMutt versions will be, though

[18:36:15] <flatcap> hi p00f.  It's about #3274
[18:36:15] <neo-bot> Issue by @klartext "Replying to mail in Mail/sent-mail - sometimes - results in Segfault": https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues/3274
[18:36:53] <flatcap> klartext got a backtrace, but with no symbols, so they're going to try rebuilding
[18:37:11] <flatcap> do you know what happens to the debugging symbols on Arch?
[18:37:28] <flatcap> or are they stripped out before install?
[18:39:06] <p00f> they get stripped unless you 
[18:39:19] <p00f> unless you add `options=(!strip)`
[18:39:40] <flatcap> ah!
[18:40:02] <p00f> https://man.archlinux.org/man/PKGBUILD.5#OPTIONS_AND_DIRECTIVES
[18:40:38] <p00f> should i comment there?
[18:40:58] <flatcap> that'd be great, thanks!
[18:42:24] <p00f> 👍️
[18:43:23] <p00f> np
[18:45:48] <p00f> oh wait
[18:46:17] <flatcap> oh?
[18:46:28] <p00f> https://debuginfod.archlinux.org/packages has neomutt
[18:47:02] <p00f> so gdb should automatically download the symbols
[18:47:55] <p00f> like `gdb neomutt` gives me this https://paste.rs/Rew
[18:48:02] * flatcap looks ...
[18:48:34] <flatcap> hmm... odd
[18:48:49] <p00f> note this... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/c1adad95fdb38617c3de7d12a9d1df535e9d5e12)
[18:49:39] <flatcap> perhaps klartext has built a different version?  or different options?
[18:50:08] <p00f> hmm maybe
[18:51:11] <flatcap> ok, thanks for your help.  we'll see if klartext can crash neomutt again
[18:51:13] <p00f> if they use `neomutt-git` version from the aur it probably wont work yeah
