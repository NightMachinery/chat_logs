[00:03:17] <somiaj> There is #debian-gnome on oftc, maybe users there know better how gdm/gnome works.
[00:03:43] <jochum> somiaj: sounds helpfull, thanks
[00:03:51] <somiaj> Or maybe you can find a gnome user here who can at least verrify that is what is happening in buster by default.

[04:24:54] <maledictium> Hi guys, couple of years ago there was this poll on debian about init systems and if I remember correctly the voted option was to also regard other init systems besides the default (or something like that). What impact does it bring for the next debian release (if any)?  
[04:29:38] <Khepra> None.
[04:30:14] <Khepra> What was voted was that systemd is default, but other inits are not excluded by policy. They're optional and at maintainer's discretion, whether a package would support it or not.

[04:35:28] *** Quits: pong (~beaver@user/pong) (Remote host closed the connection)
[04:35:29] <Khepra> it's also a bit of an apples and oranges comparison. systemd is way more than just an init. it's a process manager and middleware with cohesive plumbing. no other "init" has that feature set.
[04:36:17] <Khepra> for that reason some packages are crippled in that they cannot fully take advantage of systemd features, as their config is "init agnostic", permaintainer decision.

[04:54:29] <Blondie101010> systemd isn't too bad...  it's actually much simpler to use than other inits, but it's so badly documented
[04:56:15] <somiaj> systemd just does things its own way, but once you get use to it, it isn't that bad. I personaly (though mostly a hobbist) haven't had any issues with it
[04:57:38] <Blondie101010> after a few years working with systemd, including developing new services or adjusting some, it's very powerful and not complicated, once you get how it works

[05:44:15] <greycat> the man pages are pretty well written, honestly, but the one thing I really dislike about them is how the unit file fields (Foobar=) are split across half a dozen pages and you have to guess which page to read

[06:48:19] <nergar> Ok I'm super confused.... Why does the abaility for the root user depend on weather my regular user is or isn't on the sudo group?
[06:48:49] <somiaj> nergar: What do you mean?
[06:49:31] <nergar> sorry, wrote that all wrong.
[06:49:54] <somiaj> Outside of the installer, I don't see any coorelation with what you said.
[06:50:25] <somiaj> The installer will install sudo and add you to the sudo group only if you don't give root a password. If you give root a password it won't install sudo or put you in the sudo group.
[06:50:53] <nergar> Im trying a fresh install, and I tried to sudo apt and and got the usual user not in sudoers file warning so I did su root and tried to run visudo and I get a bash: visudo: command not found error
[06:51:22] <Blondie101010> so it's not installed
[06:51:32] <Blondie101010> just edit the file directly (carefully)
[06:51:35] <somiaj> Correct, if you gave root a password during the install sudo was not installed. so just 'apt install sudo' then 'adduser username sudo', and you can start using sudo
[06:51:41] <somiaj> Blondie101010: in this case it is most likely sudo isn't even installed
[06:51:49] <Blondie101010> ah
[06:51:51] <nergar> but then I added my user to sudo group and after su root, visudo runs
[06:51:52] <somiaj> since visudo is part of the sudo package
[06:52:00] <somiaj> nergar: oh you ahve ran across this
[06:52:03] <somiaj> !buster su
[06:52:03] <dpkg> In buster, su no longer overrides PATH by default, requiring that you use "su -" or "su -l" for login shells (which is not really a new thing at all...). See https://wiki.debian.org/NewInBuster#Changes for details.
[06:52:18] <nergar> ahhhh
[06:52:33] <nergar> I see, the path thing explains it 
[06:52:35] <somiaj> this has been one of the most painful things for newer users, apaerntally 'su' in Debian wasn't considered standard behavior so they have changed it on everyone
[06:53:01] <somiaj> well not newer users, for users of buster in general
[06:53:11] <somiaj> I personally just use 'sudo -i' these days
[06:53:28] <nergar> vim was also throwing me for a spin
[06:53:41] <nergar> until I realize I was running vim.tiny
[06:53:55] <nvs> But how come my computer won't shut down when I type "halt"? ;-)
[06:54:27] <somiaj> yea, vim.tiny is installed by default, if you want more features you need to actually install vim
[06:54:31] <somiaj> nvs: reasons
[06:54:43] <nergar> what is the real difference between adding the user to sudo group instead of wheel group??
[06:54:44] <nvs> heh
[06:55:02] <nvs> nergar: there is no wheel group in Debian?
[06:55:06] <somiaj> this came up in -next the other day, but 'halt' won't actually issue a poweroff to the machine, so though the kernel stops and the cpu stops, the machine stays on

[07:26:10] <kulernil> hi, i recently decided to clean up my space, so if I remove all other i386 related packages by apt purge "*:i386" and finally dpkg --remove-architecture i386.Does that break my system as a amd64 machine?  It won't hurt me if it the system boots successfully even some software breaks.
[07:27:13] <somiaj> That should only break any 32bit only software you wish to run

[09:39:47] <computerworm110> What process?
[09:39:51] <themill> You can already run bullseye yourself
[09:40:37] <Blondie101010> why hasn't the process started?  too many tests to finalize?
[09:41:36] <computerworm110> Yeah, themill, I know that they're already available. But I want to wait until it officially released, so that I'm getting a truly finished product. Just in case they really are doing last minute bug fixes.
[09:42:01] <computerworm110> And what process is it that takes 12-18 hours?
[09:42:35] <themill> there won't be any last minute changes today

[09:46:47] <PMT> Just to give you some idea of all the moving parts.
[09:47:18] <Blondie101010> so no new 0day showed up yet :)
[09:47:22] <computerworm110> Thanks, PMT! That's helpful. Also, wow, there's a lot of stuff left to be done, do you think they can pull it off today?
[09:48:31] <PMT> I don't know what promises are or are not made about how soon after things happen that the wiki checklist is changed, so I don't provide it as a "what's not done" so much as "what needs to be done from start to finish"
[09:48:35] <somiaj> I'd also suggest just installing bullseye now if you want to run it.
[09:48:43] <computerworm110> Also, who or what is "Britney", in this context?
[09:49:05] <somiaj> It is running fine here, and I suspect very few updates between what I'm running and the offical release.
[09:49:57] <themill> The release team tries to have zero changes to testing for the week prior to release; they're not going to have any today
[09:50:05] <computerworm110> Yeah, somiaj, I know I already can, but paradoxically, although I am eager to try it, I'm also savoring the anticipation in the runup to the official release. There's not an awful lot to look forward to during COVID. 
[09:50:19] <themill> heh
[09:50:45] <Blondie101010> themill:  what's the point of waiting a week if it doesn't allow any reaction?
[09:51:17] <computerworm110> I second Blondie101010's question? Why wait a week if there are no more changes?
[09:51:46] <computerworm110> Also, in the last part of the list, what does it mean to "enable Britney"?
[09:52:10] <somiaj> https://release.debian.org/doc/britney/what-is-britney.html
[09:52:43] <somiaj> basically that is what starts allowing pacakges to automatically flow from sid into testing after 5-10 days of no rc-bugs
[09:52:50] <somiaj> at least that is what it sounds like to me

[09:53:30] <themill> Quiet time for testing and checking is always part of any release process.

[09:54:13] <computerworm110> I just noted the update date on the BullseyeCheckList page, it was 2 days ago, so they've probably gotten more stuff done than we know.

[20:39:40] <Thanatermesis> Hobz, bs=4M is faster :)
[20:39:55] <Wyzard> @Blondie101010, if it's an image of a partition you'd write it to a partition device, but a whole-disk image needs to be written to the whole device, starting at sector 0 (because the image's content starts with sector 0 of a whole device)
[20:40:02] <Blondie101010> right
[20:40:16] <Hobz> Let's find out
[20:40:22] <Wyzard> btw, you don't really need dd; plain cp should work
[20:40:23] <Hobz> The last one took ~100s
[20:40:27] <Blondie101010> Thanatermesis:  I doubt they'll see a difference between 1M and 4M bs
[20:40:42] <n4dir> but "cp" won't impress the ladies !
[20:40:55] <Hobz> That is why I got into the linux game
[20:41:00] <Blondie101010> true, not impressive :P
[20:41:19] <Khepra> there most certainly won't be a difference between 1M and 4M for an USB _stick_
[20:41:54] <Khepra> in fact, a number of kernel iterations ago, larger bs actually hogged the system and made it unresponsive
[20:41:55] <Thanatermesis> maybe, but 4M always give me the best benchmarks
[20:42:02] <Wyzard> and unlike dd, I think plain cp will automatically detect the optimum block size for the device
[20:42:14] <Hobz> Yeah, basically the same time with 1M and 4M
[20:42:27] <Khepra> I like cp

[20:44:34] <Khepra> Thanatermesis: did you benchmark that with oflag fsync?

[20:47:10] <Blondie101010> if the drive is fast, it will make a small difference 
[20:47:24] <Blondie101010> the buffer is probably more than 1MB
[20:48:41] <Thanatermesis> Khepra, i have my own tool using oflag=sync (not fsync), but i don't remember now the reason to use it, probably because having a correct progress bar

[21:24:41] <Khepra> Blondie101010: and that's not what I meant
[21:25:10] <greycat> on most modern devices, a block size larger than 512 gives better performance

[21:25:52] <PyR3X> I thought debian 11 was out today? latest official download is still 10x
[21:25:57] <Khepra> way better, but in my experience after 128k (which is also cp's blocksize) it makes little difference, especially since: a) the kernel is buffering all that and paging out at its own pace,  b) USB sticks are terrible in performance
[21:26:01] <greycat> Some time today.  Be patient.
[21:26:41] <Blondie101010> greycat:  thanks for the correction..  you're absolutely right
[21:26:42] <Khepra> so if one truly wants to benchmark bs=1M vs bs=4M, you need to sync after each block or else you're just measuring kernel'd dirty pageout

[22:32:23] <wallbroken> hello everyone
[22:32:31] <jailbreak> hi there
[22:32:40] <wallbroken> to upgrade to debian 11, is just needed the following command: sudo apt full-upgrade ?

[22:33:59] <jailbreak> I thought this channel might've been more active with bullseye today :-(

[22:36:05] <jailbreak> wallbroken, greycat replied above
[22:36:07] <ansgar> It is 🍲 time for the people testing the installation images, but reportedly soon it is time to release the 🐙⌫◎!

[22:38:42] <somiaj> wallbroken: you should read the release notes first, it has some good tips to help things go smoothly
[22:39:03] <wallbroken> oh, updating is not easy as in Windows?
[22:39:09] *** Joins: amacater (~amacater@77.97.174.253)
[22:39:10] <wallbroken> do i need a degree to do that?
[22:39:13] <greycat> I also suggest reading https://wiki.debian.org/NewInBullseye
[22:39:50] <somiaj> It is usually fairly painless, but if you install third party repos, or other stuff, this can cause wrinkles, reading and informing yourself of best practices is always best, and since it is documented no need to repeate it here
[22:40:04] <somiaj> yes you can blindly just upgrade and hope it works (which depending on your system should)
[22:40:58] <wallbroken> but the release has been published?
[22:41:11] <greycat> No.  But the documentation has been written.
[22:41:35] <somiaj> not offically, sometime in the next 12-24 hours it will be offical, but docs are there, and so is most things, mostly is just finailizing things
[22:41:42] <greycat> If you upgrade right now, you're technically running testing, but it's as close to stable as can be.
[22:41:48] *** Quits: hggdh (~hggdh@ubuntu/member/hggdh) (Quit: WeeChat 3.3-dev)
[22:42:12] <n4dir> against all recommendations i never read release notes or such, and besides one case where i had to ask here it always worked without any problem. - That won't help you much if you run in such a case, and you have been warned. Only you can decide if you just go for it or if you want to be on the safe side

[22:44:27] <greycat> Oh,  you said deb-multimedia.  I didn't see that part.
[22:44:50] <greycat> deb-multimedia is an external repository, and is likely to cause grief for someone (based on historical records)
[22:44:58] <somiaj> !deb-multimedia
[22:44:58] <dpkg> We recommend against using deb-multimedia.org; these unofficial packages are known to cause many hard to debug problems.  They are not in Debian either because the they are poor in quality or for legal reasons.  See http://deb-multimedia.org/ or ask me about <dmm stretch>, <dmm buster>.  See also <dmm list>, <dmm mirrors>, <dmm pinning>, <why not dmm>, <dmm remove>.
[22:45:04] <fr33domlover> o/ is there a reason for me to wait for the bullseye release? Or can I already install from an existing image (rc3?) and the next `apt upgrade` will get me to the same packages as the release? (assuming the errata for rc3 doesn't have issues relevant to me)
[22:45:08] <somiaj> this can cause issues during the upgrade
[22:45:27] <somiaj> fr33domlover: no real reason at this point, you don't get securiity support until after the release, but that will be soon enough it shouldn't matter
[22:45:29] <greycat> fr33domlover: you can install bullseye now, or upgrade to bullseye now if you're running buster
