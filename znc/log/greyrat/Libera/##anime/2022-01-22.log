[01:12:00] <Bco1981> oh
[01:13:07] <emmeka> MootPoot I mean, the thing is wage growth hasn't kept pace with *anything* since the recession, and even before that it wasn't really. Wages have been super sluggish, and suddenly we have a mass instance of upskilling due to people retraining during lockdowns etc, and labour market shortages due to boomers going idk fuck it I'm retired now
[01:14:04] <emmeka> so now wages are climbing fast, faster enough that it's causing price issues, but it's mostly k

[01:33:46] <MootPoot> for all we know your partner could be making 80k
[01:34:01] <KatrinValerie> She could be making that, true.
[01:34:10] <ButterNoodle> mine's like 900.. but a 2nd mortgage used to fix the place up and pay off 10 years of accumulated debt kinda sucks 
[01:34:13] <Bco1981> and that's cheap, an apartment in the capitol is atleast x2 and up.
[01:34:14] <ButterNoodle> another 500
[01:34:27] * MootPoot throws out KatrinValeries numbers
[01:34:31] <emmeka> KatrinValerie $10k CAD isn't enough to pay rent on a 1 bedroom, anywhere.
[01:34:34] <emmeka> in this country.
[01:34:44] <MootPoot> 10k cad wont even get me a spot in emmekas cabbage patch
[01:34:52] <KatrinValerie> emmeka: we live especially cheap, we are extremely lucky.
[01:34:55] <emmeka> the equivalent of 10k EUR, about $15k CAD, would *barely* cover rent. and nothing else.
[01:35:55] <MootPoot> well, seems like rental prices for places in my city haven't really gone up
[01:36:17] <MootPoot> the temps keep all the fucking twin income buttfucks from gentrifying it
[01:36:21] * ButterNoodle hopes the housign market crashes and burns
[01:36:25] <emmeka> <MootPoot> single income is ded -- government is confused why nobody make baby, and don't stop to think "oh wait 80% of the population can't afford it really"
[01:36:33] <MootPoot> 80%?
[01:36:36] <MootPoot> more like 93
[01:36:41] <ButterNoodle> yea
[01:37:01] <KatrinValerie> If I made 80k a year I'd buy myself a comfy weighted blanket
[01:37:19] <MootPoot> I think the govt knows why - they also know that they probably cant fix it without pissing off multiple groups of people
[01:37:34] <ButterNoodle> I had kids in my late 20s.. and had a hard fucking time.. I cant imagine what it would be like for a family living on what would probably be around 80K usd in todays dollars
[01:37:36] <MootPoot> not that I even know how you'd fix this
[01:37:43] <KatrinValerie> emmeka: also our society pushing towards this insane nucleus family thing, where the mom basically raises her kids on her own.
[01:37:47] <emmeka> ButterNoodle and that's a high income!
[01:37:49] <KatrinValerie> It's so unrealistic
[01:37:58] <ButterNoodle> emmeka: not in todays money
[01:38:08] <MootPoot> not in city-money
[01:38:12] <MootPoot> maybe in boonie-money
[01:38:13] <emmeka> KatrinValerie I don't see how that's unrealistic, to have a stay at home parent taking care of children.
[01:38:17] <KatrinValerie> People used to have support structures for child rearing
[01:38:18] <emmeka> this is basically the normal way to do it
[01:38:30] <emmeka> and the way nobody can afford to do it
[01:38:44] <emmeka> instead you get 2 working parents killing themselves to raise kids
[01:38:47] <KatrinValerie> emmeka: way too many parents can't deal with the situation even if they can afford it.
[01:39:04] <emmeka> the situation you describe is if anything the unobtainable ideal now
[01:39:13] <MootPoot> emmeka: tbh I think the nuclear family is kind of garbage  to begin with
[01:39:16] <emmeka> fucked if anyone can have a single-income family with kids
[01:39:16] <KatrinValerie> let's just say it is a bad idea to leave a depressed mom completely on her own with her kids
[01:39:20] <MootPoot> 2 people  arent enough to raise kids
[01:39:24] <ButterNoodle> price day care today..
[01:39:29] <ButterNoodle> crazy
[01:39:41] <KatrinValerie> MootPoot: my point
[01:39:43] <ButterNoodle> 2-400 a week per kid
[01:39:46] <MootPoot> I'd push more for the communal or at least living close together
[01:39:53] <KatrinValerie> Well, we do have some support systems, but they broke down during  the pandemic
[01:39:55] <MootPoot> send the kids to the grandparents place for the week
[01:39:57] <MootPoot> or something
[01:40:04] <ButterNoodle> yea I didnt have that
[01:40:06] <MootPoot> grandpa get up off your ass
[01:40:15] <ButterNoodle> unfortunately
[01:40:16] <MootPoot> and stop watching catgirls, that's my job
[01:40:21] <ButterNoodle> tru
[01:40:57] <emmeka> MootPoot I just hope in a few decades we do see a true culture shift to parent being a gender-neutral job in society
[01:40:58] <KatrinValerie> ButterNoodle: here at least normal kindergarten is free, but that only covers the time till early afternoon
[01:41:06] <emmeka> imagine all the NEETs who'd be great stay at home dads
[01:41:10] <emmeka> a veritable baby boom
[01:41:16] <emmeka> "look ##anime, I made my own loli"
[01:41:16] <MootPoot> lol
[01:41:21] <MootPoot> LOL
[01:41:23] <MootPoot> okay
[01:41:27] <ButterNoodle> KatrinValerie: before/aftershool care is not as expensive as all day..
[01:41:31] <KatrinValerie> emmeka: it sort of scares and intrigues me at the same time
[01:42:18] <ButterNoodle> idk what that costs today.. for 2 kids in ~2004 I was paying 300 a week in child care
[01:42:22] <emmeka> MootPoot QC does an interesting thing. There, parental leave has to be split equally between the parents and is use-it-or-lose-it for the dad.
[01:42:26] <ButterNoodle> probably double that now for the same thing
[01:42:40] <emmeka> so everyone *has* to be a stay at home dad, at least for a while
[01:42:45] <emmeka> it's a good policy
[01:42:50] <ButterNoodle> I did it
[01:42:51] <MootPoot> I mean 
[01:42:55] <KatrinValerie> Trying to watch fight club and it depicts DID in a really weird way is all I can say
[01:42:56] <MootPoot> with remote working
[01:43:14] <MootPoot> basically every dev like me that is WFH is automatically now the mom
[01:43:41] <MootPoot> just throw a xbox at the kid and make sure he dosent set the house on fire
[01:43:45] <MootPoot> alhtough
[01:43:45] <KatrinValerie> The losing time stuff is accurate though
[01:44:02] <MootPoot> emmeka: policy aside - pointless policy if nobody has the kids to use it
[01:44:16] <ButterNoodle> yea wfh means u get to have nooners with the secretary when she brings u a sammich
[01:44:23] <ButterNoodle> *hope my wife doesnt get mad
[01:44:25] <MootPoot> lol
[01:44:52] <MootPoot> maybe some day there will be like a different version of sending your grandpa overseas to thailand for a pension
[01:45:13] <MootPoot> instead you have kids, raise them until year 1/2 and then send them to SE asia like a boarding school
[01:45:23] <MootPoot> and just send like 1000-1500 a month
[01:45:28] <emmeka> boarding school costs $$$
[01:45:36] <MootPoot> not if its in SE asia
[01:45:36] <emmeka> 1500 a month?!
[01:45:36] <ButterNoodle> send them there to make clothes and iphones?
[01:45:50] <MootPoot> 1500 a month and you can live like a king in asia
[01:46:00] <ButterNoodle> I'm fucking huge in asia
[01:46:03] <emmeka> for $1500 a month I can pay for them to have an apartment and tell them to live it up however they please
[01:46:03] <MootPoot> tbh 700 would be fine as well
[01:46:08] * ButterNoodle kimochis
[01:46:18] <MootPoot> emmeka:  500 dosent covent food, utilities, stuff you need
[01:46:19] <ButterNoodle> u talking Thailand?
[01:46:24] <MootPoot> a single apt is 1k
[01:46:32] <MootPoot> I know you live in the fields but
[01:46:46] <MootPoot> 1500 is "aww that's cute" money
[01:46:58] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: yea
[01:46:59] <emmeka> "you're 8 years old now son, here's the keys to your bachelor pad and a wifi connection. go find a job, best of luck to you"
[01:47:07] <MootPoot> I kid you not
[01:47:10] <MootPoot> this is how I was raised
[01:47:18] <ButterNoodle> "good luck, we are all counting on you"
[01:47:18] <MootPoot> me pops lived and worked here
[01:47:28] <MootPoot> I got a check for ~1000-1500 a month

[01:47:51] <emmeka> MootPoot yeah yeah you're from a wealthy family I get it
[01:47:57] <MootPoot> ....
[01:48:00] <emmeka> $1500 is like idk half my monthly income
[01:48:00] <ButterNoodle> ....
[01:48:01] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: tell this guy
[01:48:03] <ButterNoodle> define wealthy
[01:48:05] <MootPoot> how much 1500 is 
[01:48:27] <emmeka> wealthy as in above median income, what you'd call upper middle class.
[01:48:45] <ButterNoodle> I get it.. wealth is relative to lifestyle and operating costs
[01:48:51] <MootPoot> yes, but you seem to be missing the point here
[01:48:58] <ButterNoodle> ask someone in hoboken nj what stuff costs
[01:49:03] <MootPoot> it would cost like 3k / mo to raise me here
[01:49:12] <MootPoot> and that's just stuff like paying for food
[01:49:12] <emmeka> lol no it wouldn't
[01:49:18] <emmeka> in what universe
[01:49:24] <MootPoot> living in a city universe
[01:49:40] <emmeka> your food bill isn't $3k, and if it is, you're doing something wrong
[01:49:42] <ButterNoodle> magnitudes of difference in cost of lifing
[01:49:47] <MootPoot> ^
[01:50:09] <emmeka> no, he's wrong. I know the prices out there, I've spent plenty of time where MootPoot lives.
[01:50:26] <emmeka> sure, it's pricier than the east. but you're not spending $3k on expenses *not including rent*
[01:50:29] <ButterNoodle> emmeka: u try to buy groceries in some of these high income places.. 3k is probably not far from the cost
[01:50:29] <emmeka> if you are, budget son
[01:50:34] <MootPoot> emmeka: thats including rent
[01:50:49] <MootPoot> total cost
[01:51:13] <emmeka> you estimate the total cost to raise a child in urban AB right now at $3000 a month?
[01:51:15] <emmeka> you're insane.
[01:51:27] <emmeka> that's above median income alone.
[01:51:44] <ButterNoodle> infant? probably close to it
[01:51:49] <MootPoot> <emmeka> 
[01:51:49] <MootPoot> <MootPoot> single income is ded -- government is confused why nobody make baby, and don't stop to think "oh wait 80% of the population can't afford it really"
[01:51:51] <MootPoot> I mean
[01:51:53] <ButterNoodle> 300 a week in child care minimum
[01:51:57] <MootPoot> you literally just aknowledged it
[01:52:09] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: 300?
[01:52:10] <ButterNoodle> diapers/formula 100-150 a week
[01:52:18] <MootPoot> more like 5
[01:52:21] <ButterNoodle> well
[01:52:25] <emmeka> ok, wait, if we're assuming fulltime daycare, then yes
[01:52:29] <ButterNoodle> depends on how much u like ur kid I guesws
[01:52:31] <emmeka> this is a sensible estimate
[01:52:55] <ButterNoodle> the rusty jungle gym just means they are flexible on price
[01:53:03] <MootPoot> shit adds up
[01:53:11] <emmeka> but I was operating on the assumption we were talking about just the cost to raise a kid, ie, how much food they eat, clothes, all the random stupid shit kids need, the extra rent for an extra room
[01:53:41] <ButterNoodle> you have to cost it all ma dood.. u cant always count on other people to help
[01:53:50] <ButterNoodle> I got a rude awakening
[01:53:54] <MootPoot> functionally for me I was sent off while me parents worked here
[01:54:02] <MootPoot> worked out cheaper
[01:54:26] <MootPoot> although now I dont really have the kind of relationship with them that you'd expect with other families
[01:54:36] <emmeka> this isn't $3000, hell, the two of us don't cost $3000 to keep alive. and you can't chalk it up to "yeah well things cost more in the city". AB food prices are high, they're not $3000 a month high.
[01:54:48] <MootPoot> I never said just food though
[01:54:55] <MootPoot> idk what you're on
[01:55:05] <ButterNoodle> I think I've been as high as 1600 a month in groceries alone..
[01:55:13] <ButterNoodle> idk what that would be in todays money
[01:56:07] <MootPoot> the total cost of supporting a single parent + 1 child is what I'm using 
[01:56:11] <emmeka> MootPoot yes, and unless that budget includes fulltime daycare, 1 kid doesn't cost $3000 a month. I'd have died by the age of 4
[01:56:30] <ButterNoodle> its relative to where u live tho
[01:56:31] <MootPoot> apartment with 2 bedrooms = 1500 dollars right there
[01:56:40] <ButterNoodle> thats the point I'm trying to make
[01:56:46] <MootPoot> butter is right
[01:56:50] <emmeka> MootPoot oh, ok, that's very very different
[01:56:58] <emmeka> so you're saying that's the cost for the whole family unit
[01:57:01] <MootPoot> yes
[01:57:05] <MootPoot> I said that before as well
[01:57:07] <emmeka> fair enough
[01:57:09] <ButterNoodle> far cheaper to raise a family on 60K a year in montana vs california
[01:57:27] <MootPoot> its much cheaper to just set aside 1k or 1.5k a month and have your kids raised elsewhere
[01:57:59] <MootPoot> then increase your own living costs ( on the low end ) to 3k, or even 4-5 depending
[01:58:37] <emmeka> I feel like the fact that you were raised in boarding school explains a lot of the random knowledge about things you seem to lack
[01:58:46] <MootPoot> I had my own house
[01:58:48] <MootPoot> though
[01:58:50] <MootPoot> :3
[01:59:14] <MootPoot> although my parents did want to send me off to boarding school
[01:59:14] <emmeka> yeah yeah I get it, kid from a wealthy family and all
[01:59:38] <MootPoot> you need your prices re-adjusted
[01:59:42] <MootPoot> live in the city for a bit
[01:59:46] <emmeka> I have
[01:59:50] <MootPoot> now
[01:59:52] <emmeka> you forget that I've been everywhere.
[02:00:14] <MootPoot> I'm also using today's money as a metric
[02:00:16] <emmeka> look, I know what shit costs in Edmonton.
[02:00:21] <MootPoot> so remembering stuff from back then
[02:00:31] <emmeka> I was there in 2019.
[02:00:39] <MootPoot> ugh
[02:01:01] <MootPoot> you could have visited
[02:01:19] <emmeka> and don't give me "yeah but it's so much worse now!" like I know, I'm aware of the housing market and inflation.
[02:01:22] <MootPoot> also theres one other thing which comes into account
[02:01:25] <emmeka> MootPoot were you even here then?
[02:01:28] <MootPoot> there is budgeting
[02:01:33] <MootPoot> and there is actual spending
[02:01:53] <MootPoot> aside from my tech toys I dont have anything lavish
[02:02:02] <MootPoot> and my tech toys I worked for and bought all myself
[02:02:10] <MootPoot> post 2017 that is
[02:02:16] <emmeka> stats page shows you first appearing here around November 2019
[02:02:33] <MootPoot> I've used IRC from more then one country
[02:02:39] <emmeka> MootPoot I mean your spending is lavish because you have nearly 100% disposable income
[02:02:45] <MootPoot> although I have been in alberta since before that
[02:02:57] <MootPoot> I'd like to keep it that way
[02:03:06] <emmeka> and this is not how most people's incomes work
[02:03:20] <MootPoot> but anyway, I did do the math of moving out
[02:03:23] <MootPoot> and for me, just me
[02:03:29] <MootPoot> it works out to be ~2.2k
[02:03:39] <emmeka> that's right enough
[02:03:47] <emmeka> you could go lower, if you needed.
[02:03:56] <emmeka> but as far as comfortable, reasonable, yeah
[02:04:03] <MootPoot> no, that's on the low end
[02:04:09] <MootPoot> 2.2k not including a car
[02:04:13] <emmeka> you could make do with less.
[02:04:15] <MootPoot> if I had a car then push to 3
[02:04:24] * emmeka shakes cane
[02:04:26] <emmeka> kids these days!
[02:04:30] <MootPoot> zoomer moment - insurance for my age group
[02:04:33] <MootPoot> dont blame me
[02:04:55] <MootPoot> I can afford the car as a one time thing - pay 3-5k for a used corolla but 
[02:05:02] <MootPoot> pass on that insurance
[02:05:25] <MootPoot> and my province being my province
[02:05:47] <MootPoot> either I increase my rent by 500-600 to get a place where I can walk places
[02:05:48] <MootPoot> OR
[02:06:05] <MootPoot> I save on rent and end up spending the same on a car
[02:06:29] <MootPoot> so the 2.2k is more of a "lowest price suggestion"

[03:06:48] <Satin> i should go run ideally
[03:06:54] <MootPoot> No!
[03:06:58] <MootPoot> outside scary
[03:07:02] <MootPoot> stay indoors
[03:07:04] <MootPoot> where its safe
[03:07:08] <Satin> but i've already walked a bunch to and back to school, and doing a pile full of dishes was slightly taxing hmm
[03:07:33] <MootPoot> my thighs are still sore from all that squatting I did with 2 hours of beat saber at midnight yesterday
[03:07:37] <Satin> eh watch says 7k steps, I guess i should try to finally aim for 10k
[03:07:41] <MootPoot> is this what its like doing cowgirl
[03:07:52] <MootPoot> Satin: your phone dosen't have its own step tracker?
[03:07:58] <Satin> nope
[03:08:03] <Satin> and that sounds even more innacurate
[03:08:26] <MootPoot> some higher end ones have their own stepmeter/pedometer built in
[03:08:27] <MootPoot> as a chip
[03:08:28] <MootPoot> mine does
[03:08:39] <Satin> yeah nah idk if that's a thing in mine but i woludn't use it personally
[03:09:04] <MootPoot> y  not
[03:09:13] <Urchin[emacs]> my watch is powered by me moving around
[03:09:13] <MootPoot> its the same tech that is in those fancy smartwatches
[03:09:22] <MootPoot> Urchin[emacs]: boomer
[03:09:29] <Urchin[emacs]> :P
[03:09:31] <Urchin[emacs]> am not
[03:09:37] <MootPoot> do people still buy watches?
[03:09:43] <MootPoot> I mean, aside from rich fucks or cosplayers
[03:09:45] <Satin> MootPoot: I'm fine with Garmin having my data.
[03:09:46] <Satin> Not google.
[03:09:52] <MootPoot> I guess there are those casio fanboys
[03:09:55] <MootPoot> I would wear a casio
[03:09:56] <Satin> Not for that sort of thing.
[03:10:07] <MootPoot> ???
[03:10:09] <MootPoot> what data
[03:10:15] <Satin> health data
[03:10:16] <Satin> ?
[03:10:17] <MootPoot> the tracker in your phone dosent use gps
[03:10:18] <MootPoot> tho
[03:10:31] <MootPoot> its litreally just a bouncy bounce calculator
[03:10:37] <Urchin[emacs]> MootPoot: they go in and out of fashion, and, as for anything these days, there are groups of enthusiasts that really like watches
[03:10:45] <Satin> Anyways. My watch does more than just collect walk data lol.
[03:10:49] <MootPoot> oh no
[03:11:01] <MootPoot> I do have a smartband
[03:11:03] <MootPoot> a huawei one
[03:11:07] <Satin> cringe
[03:11:09] <MootPoot> havent used it in forever
[03:11:13] <Satin> then use it
[03:11:17] <Urchin[emacs]> I don't like smartwatches, having to recharge them is annoying
[03:11:20] <MootPoot> ^
[03:11:23] <Satin> get some dumbbells
[03:11:36] <Satin> Eh. Mine lasts for some days, and I usually just charge it when it's low
[03:11:44] <Satin> which is every few days
[03:11:44] <GIR0001> if your concerned about GPS tracking on your phone (which even if you disable location services your location can still be obtained through a third party) use an encrypted pager to go off the grid and only use your phone when your home
[03:11:46] <MootPoot> Satin: the only real reason I used it was because when I used to go outside and walk around its handy to have nav messages on your wrist
[03:12:02] <Satin> GIR0001: no, I'm talking about health data specifically. Not GPS data.
[03:12:08] <GIR0001> alrighty
[03:12:17] <Satin> GIR0001: I'm aware GMaps and what not already have my data in that regard.
[03:12:26] <Satin> They don't have all the health data my watch/garmin app is collecting though.
[03:12:39] <Satin> I didn't stick with a fitbit again for a reason /shrug
[03:12:44] <MootPoot> ask sadale to make a FOSS smartwatch
[03:12:54] <MootPoot> but tbh I'd rather the chinese have my data
[03:12:58] <MootPoot> then any american firm
[03:13:01] <Urchin[emacs]> I do have a solar G-Shock that has time, day, date, moon phase, tide graph, stopwatch, timer, 6 alarms, world time and radio timesynch with atomic clocks
[03:13:03] <Satin> My smartwatch might be one of the most important tools/devices
[03:13:06] <Urchin[emacs]> that's not a smartwatch
[03:13:18] <Satin> Urchin[emacs]: fancy
[03:13:29] <MootPoot> Urchin[emacs]: ur g spot can do a lotta things
[03:13:34] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: more like large and ugly
[03:13:38] <Satin> MootPoot: can you stop being weird for one second
[03:13:49] <Satin> Urchin[emacs]: eh, that's still fancy from those features :D
[03:14:08] <MootPoot> I used to be really into getting a skagen watch
[03:14:18] <MootPoot> but then I realized watches are pointless and annoying

[03:14:53] <MootPoot> can I get a elbow watch
[03:15:59] <MootPoot> I would consider the compromise if smartwatches were like
[03:16:07] <Urchin[emacs]> MootPoot: don't put your arms on your desk to type, that's bad ergonomics, they should be in the air, typing should be done from the elbow
[03:16:25] <MootPoot> the battery actually  lasted a week or two and it could completely replace my phone
[03:16:33] <MootPoot> Urchin[emacs]: T rex typing?
[03:16:43] <Urchin[emacs]> MootPoot: proper typing
[03:16:51] <MootPoot> ???????
[03:17:11] <MootPoot> oh I see
[03:17:15] <MootPoot> yeah I cant do that
[03:17:28] <Urchin[emacs]> MootPoot: I'm formally trained in typing on typewriters (this shows less my age, more the primitiveness of the shithole I live in)
[03:17:34] <MootPoot> chair does not go high enough, and even if it did - my desk is too low
[03:17:48] <MootPoot> best I can do is my arms are prefectly at the level of my desk
[03:17:56] <MootPoot> so my forearms are resting on the desk
[03:17:57] <Urchin[emacs]> MootPoot: that's some weird setup
[03:18:14] <MootPoot> I guess I could get one of those chair mats
[03:18:23] <MootPoot> and that would maybe give me the extra inch

[03:26:05] <MootPoot> you cant just hit any keys?
[03:27:46] <Urchin[emacs]> in practice I sit semi-reclined, and the keyboard is slightly above, so my arms aren't horizontal, but are roughly in the angle they'd be if I had a textbook ergonomic setup
[03:28:10] <Urchin[emacs]> as for keyboard, I'm simply using a classic Logitech K120, and it works fine for me
[03:28:12] <MootPoot> a footrest really helped me with slouching
[03:28:15] <MootPoot> makes it much harder
[03:30:41] <Urchin[emacs]> I'm saying your wrists shouldn't be on the table in the first place
[03:30:50] <MootPoot> I know
[03:30:59] <MootPoot> what I'm saying is with my current setup I cant not do that

[03:31:34] <Urchin[emacs]> MootPoot: what about moving the keyboard to the edge of the desk, so there's no desk to lean on?
[03:31:42] <Urchin[emacs]> MootPoot: and also tilting it?
[03:31:56] <MootPoot> best I can do is like maybe get a wrist rest for my keyboard, but it seems like I'm not supposed to make any wrist contact at all
[03:32:17] <MootPoot> tilting - you mean  like put down the legs on my KB?
[03:32:23] <MootPoot> so the front is raised?
[03:33:24] <Urchin[emacs]> back is raised
[03:33:38] <Urchin[emacs]> so legs down
[03:33:44] <MootPoot> yeah I can do that but I hate it
[03:33:48] <Urchin[emacs]> ah
[03:33:51] <MootPoot> makes me have to raise my wrists more
[03:34:01] <MootPoot> its the entire reason I moved from a normal board to low profile

[05:03:57] <MootPoot> nah, but its a stepping stone
[05:04:08] <MootPoot> like, they pay market rate or slightly under
[05:04:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Are benefits/conditions any good?
[05:04:20] <MootPoot> dont know, just applying online
[05:04:27] <MootPoot> that kind of stuff gets clarified at the interview 
[05:04:33] <MootPoot> or when they actually give you the work contract
[05:04:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: They usually bother saying upfront if they offer health insurance & the like.
[05:04:43] <MootPoot> I'm just trying to get <any> dev job
[05:04:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's a waste of everyone's time not to.
[05:04:46] <MootPoot> atm
[05:04:57] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose: interviews are a waste of everyones time but they keep doing it
[05:05:20] <MootPoot> we've found out long ago that interviews, code tests, and other crap is a shit indicator of a person's skill
[05:06:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Hm, I think interview with the teamlead to know if you'll be able to work together might be of use.
[05:07:34] <MootPoot> afaik I think was one of the giants
[05:07:50] <MootPoot> google/amazon etc that posted that conclusion - interviews are largely useless
[05:08:51] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yup, it also means that any company that wants ridiculous numbers or procedures for them should just be ignored entirely.
[05:09:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They're wasting your time and often asking you to do free work without payin gyou.
[05:09:36] <MootPoot> I'm pretty sure they only do that becuase 1.) some manager somewhere thought it was a good idea 2.) HR wants less resumes to filter through 3.) some company who is not tech related thinks that is the way to grade devs
[05:09:50] <Satin> I don't think interviews are useless but it really depends on expectations too
[05:09:59] <Satin> the way interviews are conducted are lame
[05:10:02] <MootPoot> up here where I live most companies are not tech based
[05:10:08] <Satin> but the concept is p reasonable tbh
[05:10:29] <Satin> man i'm so close to drinking this 40g so
[05:10:31] <Satin> soda
[05:10:43] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Satin: They're largely useless as anything but finding out whether you'll be able to work with teamlead/direct-supervisor. And even then.
[05:10:54] <MootPoot> where tf are you even picking up that garbage Satin 
[05:10:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They can also, sometimes, tell you if the company's expectations align with yours.
[05:11:01] <Satin> MootPoot: livingroom
[05:11:04] <MootPoot> just dont buy it - no temptation
[05:11:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Sometimes their expectations are obviously ridiculous.
[05:11:04] <Satin> housemates have drinks
[05:11:07] <MootPoot> oh
[05:11:09] <MootPoot> well
[05:11:11] <MootPoot> fuck em
[05:11:15] <Satin> ok i drank a very slight bit
[05:11:17] <Satin> putting it away
[05:11:19] <MootPoot> consider all your housemates to have HIV
[05:11:20] <Satin> repulsed by the taste ig
[05:11:46] <MootPoot> there is this one company on my uni job board asking for a embedded dev that knows C
[05:11:54] <MootPoot> ( Phd preferred )
[05:11:58] <MootPoot> LOL
[05:12:06] <Satin> based
[05:12:22] <Satin> it's very likely that no embedded dev that is actively using C has a PhD
[05:12:41] <MootPoot> people with PhDs dont work as devs
[05:12:45] <MootPoot> they work as academics
[05:12:49] <MootPoot> or consultants
[05:12:54] <Satin> exactly
[05:13:57] <ButterNoodle> fucking hell
[05:14:10] <MootPoot> Bco1981: got that new cable - seems to have worked its magic. It is ~30% thicker then the original DP cable I had according to my digital calipers and shorter as well - no more black screens or artifacts
[05:14:11] <Satin> heil
[05:14:17] <ButterNoodle> never had to do this much manual downloading of my shit
[05:14:33] <MootPoot> you download your shit?

[05:15:41] <Satin> so true
[05:16:08] <ButterNoodle> Satin: sonarr it scrapes torrent and newznab sites for shows and arranges them
[05:16:13] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: I cut open the cat69 cable sheath and replace the inner seperator with a tube - then I plug that tube into my ass and shit
[05:16:21] <MootPoot> upload my shit to my isp
[05:16:27] <ButterNoodle> has worked damn good until this season
[05:16:38] <ButterNoodle> I think I've been using it for 4 maybe 5 years
[05:16:46] <Satin> i c
[05:16:55] <MootPoot> i C
[05:16:56] <ButterNoodle> just add the shows and forget about it - they download get moved and renamed
[05:17:22] <ButterNoodle> they didnt bother with the japanese names this season apparently
[05:17:33] <ButterNoodle> so it doesnt search on 90% of sites out there

[08:16:46] <MootPoot> it was...
[08:16:48] <ButterNoodle> ic
[08:16:49] <ButterNoodle> nice
[08:16:52] <MootPoot> 16 dollars for 700 grams
[08:16:53] <MootPoot> I  think
[08:17:01] <MootPoot> probably expensive compared to your prices
[08:17:05] <ButterNoodle> cost of meat is high
[08:17:06] <ButterNoodle> naa
[08:17:09] <ButterNoodle> its high everywhere
[08:17:12] <MootPoot> !c 700 grams to oz
[08:17:13] <ImoutoBot> MootPoot: 700 Gram = 24.6918 Ounce
[08:17:22] <MootPoot> 24 ounces for about 14 usd I guess
[08:17:35] <ButterNoodle> about the going rate
[08:18:04] <MootPoot> there too?
[08:18:07] <MootPoot> huh
[08:18:08] <ButterNoodle> ribeye is about $5 more 
[08:18:09] <ButterNoodle> yea
[08:18:13] <ButterNoodle> food prices are shit
[08:18:57] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: tbone is not sold in supermarkets in Japan :(
[08:19:14] <ButterNoodle> tbone is not my fav cut anyway
[08:19:29] <MootPoot> I dont know too much about beef cuts
[08:19:45] <MootPoot> I just know there are ribs , calves, and rounds you can get
[08:19:48] <ButterNoodle> ribeye, fillet, strip
[08:19:50] <MootPoot> at least at the common stores here
[08:19:51] <ButterNoodle> in order
[08:20:08] <MootPoot> I whacked that shit with the hammer
[08:20:12] <MootPoot> like 30 times
[08:20:25] <MootPoot> wow
[08:20:32] <MootPoot> twitter is doing NFT stuff now
[08:22:10] <MootPoot> beef is hard to keto with
[08:22:14] <MootPoot> or at least these inner rounds are
[08:22:24] <MootPoot> the amount of fat in each one varies so much
[08:22:33] <MootPoot> no idea how much 
[08:23:33] <MootPoot> picked up a pack of walnuts
[08:23:43] <MootPoot> seems to a really high density fat adder
[08:23:52] <MootPoot> which isen't straight oil or butter etc
[08:23:59] <ButterNoodle> butter
[08:24:07] <ButterNoodle> I do a lot of beef
[08:24:09] <MootPoot> 30g of walnuts has 22g of fat
[08:24:19] <ButterNoodle> nut in ur beef tho
[08:24:26] <MootPoot> I usually use a combo of chicken and mayo
[08:24:35] <ButterNoodle> chicken so lean
[08:24:43] <MootPoot> I cant do too much butter - I cant deal with the oil coating in my mouth
[08:24:47] <mixfix41> Satin: i admit i dont have a clue where btc near future could go. good for you though i wouldnt want to influence you its all about being secure about our days!
[08:24:50] <ButterNoodle> good fatty beef is $$$$$
[08:24:59] <MootPoot> chicken is nice becuase its cheap and its only high in protien
[08:25:06] <MootPoot> so its easier to balence out how much fat and protien
[08:25:22] <ButterNoodle> never invest more money in stuff then u can stand to toss out the back door into the wind
[08:25:36] <ButterNoodle> yuck
[08:25:42] <MootPoot> with the weather here it'll just insta-freeze and hit me in the face
[08:25:43] <ButterNoodle> wonder how much my miner is making :|
[08:26:00] <MootPoot> my local grocery store has a hit and miss supply of meat 
[08:26:07] <MootPoot> dosen't always have everything I need
[08:26:22] <MootPoot> so when I cant find chicken then I'll go for beef
[08:27:19] <ButterNoodle> I just eat salad
[08:27:21] <ButterNoodle> mostly
[08:27:39] <MootPoot> chicken for protein and salad + mayo for fat
[08:27:45] <MootPoot> might mix it up with cheese
[08:27:47] <ButterNoodle> yep
[08:27:51] <MootPoot> or eggs for protein
[08:27:53] <ButterNoodle> extra cheeeeeeeeeeeeeese
[08:27:58] <ButterNoodle> and nutttttttttttttttttttttts
[08:28:11] <MootPoot> I dont undertand how everything has at least 1 gram of carbs
[08:28:15] <MootPoot> where is that 1 gram coming from
[08:28:30] <ButterNoodle> idk.. air?
[08:29:07] <ButterNoodle> I use my old ultrabook more than the new one..
[08:29:14] <ButterNoodle> I should have put arch on that one
[08:29:28] <MootPoot> one trip to the grocery store costs me  about ~ 100 bucks
[08:29:33] <MootPoot> lasts 1.5 weeks I guess
[08:29:52] <MootPoot> ~300 a month or maybe 400
[08:32:14] <MootPoot> today I had = 1650 calories so far
[08:32:19] <MootPoot> 67 g of protien 
[08:32:29] <MootPoot> and 177g of fat
[08:32:39] <MootPoot> there was a LOT of mayo in the morning

[09:48:01] <MootPoot> amigojapan: 
[09:48:21] <PancakeMatsuri> hello there
[09:48:33] <MootPoot> PancakeMatsuri: lets talk about something
[09:48:34] <MootPoot> I'm bored
[09:48:41] <MootPoot> I'll start
[09:48:45] <PancakeMatsuri> MootPoot, ventilation!
[09:49:01] <MootPoot> PancakeMatsuri: do you believe in the "you can only really do 3 things a day" idea of time management
[09:49:26] <PancakeMatsuri> MootPoot, well, I've heard it in a different way
[09:50:01] <amigojapan> Hey MootPoot seems I got your point with a minute of lag
[09:50:03] <PancakeMatsuri> You plan to do 3 things, so that you don't feel bad about failing to meet your expectations
[09:50:37] <PancakeMatsuri> It makes sense that way
[09:50:39] <MootPoot> is that it?
[09:50:39] <amigojapan> omero: fax me a bisquet
[09:50:53] <MootPoot> I thought it was a "I ONLY have three things to do, its so easy" kind of mindset
[09:51:02] <MootPoot> to avoid mental clutter with too many tasks
[09:51:11] <PancakeMatsuri> MootPoot, well, maybe that too
[09:51:25] <MootPoot> amigojapan: what do you think
[09:51:38] <amigojapan> MootPoot: about what?
[09:51:40] <PancakeMatsuri> MootPoot, but, you can have big things as well, if you want
[09:51:51] <MootPoot> PancakeMatsuri: I've tried stuff like pomodoro but its too micromanage-y , it dosen't help 
[09:51:58] <MootPoot> maybe I'm doing it wrong
[09:52:14] <PancakeMatsuri> MootPoot, I use pomo, when I work. Always
[09:52:20] <PancakeMatsuri> it helps
[09:52:35] <PancakeMatsuri> tell me about your usage
[09:52:42] <MootPoot> amigojapan: this below
[09:52:46] <MootPoot> <MootPoot> PataPoo 
[09:52:46] <MootPoot> PancakeMatsuri: do you believe in the "you can only really do 3 things a day" idea of time management
[09:52:57] <MootPoot> ^
[09:53:14] <MootPoot> PancakeMatsuri: maybe its becuase either my tasks take wayyyyyyyy longer then a pomo or are much shorter
[09:53:20] <MootPoot> I'm the "get lost in a task type"
[09:53:27] <MootPoot> rather then do it in cycles
[09:53:31] <PancakeMatsuri> MootPoot, you batch tasks that take less time
[09:53:57] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I try to do only one big thing a day
[09:53:58] <PancakeMatsuri> MootPoot, I use breaks to get good ideas by idling
[09:55:17] <MootPoot> amigojapan: how big is a big thing
[09:55:26] <MootPoot> like, if you go to work for a day, is that a big thing?
[09:55:38] <PancakeMatsuri> MootPoot, you use many pomos for a long task
[09:55:39] <amigojapan> MootPoot: work or clinic
[09:55:54] <amigojapan> Yep MootPoot 
[09:56:53] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I did many things when I was younger
[09:57:28] <MootPoot> PancakeMatsuri:  do you extend the length of your pomos as you get more used to it?
[09:57:43] <MootPoot> Or, do you like bait yourself with time off as a reward
[09:57:49] <MootPoot> 1hr pomo 30 min off 
[09:57:54] <MootPoot> rinse and repeat
[09:58:27] <PancakeMatsuri> MootPoot, I wanted to experiment, but I never got to it. I found that I got used to 25 minutes, and that feels really long
[09:58:43] <PancakeMatsuri> also, rest is importnt!
[09:59:06] <PancakeMatsuri> rest before you get tired!
[09:59:43] <PancakeMatsuri> I do 4x25, then 30 minutes rest, but usually way more than 30 minutes nowadays
[10:00:01] <MootPoot> what work do you do?
[10:00:10] <PancakeMatsuri> software dev
[10:00:31] <MootPoot> hmm
[10:00:37] <MootPoot> you dont have that problem where like
[10:00:50] <MootPoot> if you abandon something and come back - no matter for how little time you leave it
[10:01:00] <MootPoot> your thought process just turns into "???????????????????????????????"
[10:01:11] <PancakeMatsuri> I have notes
[10:01:20] <PancakeMatsuri> and, 5 minutes are for idling
[10:01:29] <PancakeMatsuri> not for getting into news or whatever
[10:01:36] <MootPoot> oh
[10:01:42] <MootPoot> I thought it was like a coffee break
[10:01:43] <PancakeMatsuri> I get great ideas from rest
[10:01:45] <MootPoot> water cooler talk
[10:01:48] <PancakeMatsuri> something clicks
[10:01:58] <PancakeMatsuri> The most I do is chats
[10:02:01] <MootPoot> so your 5min break is just "hands off keyboard moment"
[10:02:08] <MootPoot> but you are still thinking about it
[10:02:12] <PancakeMatsuri> mind off tasks
[10:02:21] <PancakeMatsuri> and god forbid thinking of another task
[10:02:44] <PancakeMatsuri> no, I don't think, I  just wait for idle mind to bring me ideas on a plate
[10:03:08] <PancakeMatsuri> thinking would not let me rest
[10:03:32] <PancakeMatsuri> so, it's mind off problems moment

[10:05:29] <MootPoot> hrm
[10:05:32] <MootPoot> I might try that
[10:05:55] <MootPoot> I usually just go for the three tasks a day thing so I dont feel like I'm bound by a scedule to do stuff
[10:06:09] <MootPoot> last time I did pomo I just kept on checking the clock nonstop
[10:06:36] <MootPoot> I have the same problem with sleep - I cant sleep if I know I have only X amount of time to sleep
[10:10:29] <amigojapan> Shower...brb
[10:12:06] <PancakeMatsuri> MootPoot, hey, but pomo is supposed to give you peace of mind
[10:12:15] <PancakeMatsuri> because your taks is boxed
[10:12:32] <MootPoot> It just gives me clock anxiety 
[10:12:46] <MootPoot> Maybe if I hide all the clocks in my easy view 
[10:12:57] <PancakeMatsuri> that sucks
[10:13:17] <MootPoot> Btw if I may ask 
[10:13:23] <MootPoot> How many hours do you work
[10:13:28] <MootPoot> Per day
[10:13:28] <PancakeMatsuri> ~11
[10:13:32] <PancakeMatsuri> per week
[10:13:41] <MootPoot> That's it? 
[10:13:42] <MootPoot> Wow
[10:13:45] <PancakeMatsuri> I feel like shit most of the time
[10:13:48] <MootPoot> Lucky 
[10:13:55] <PancakeMatsuri> so, working more is hard
[10:14:18] <MootPoot> I've been told that people can only really do like 4 hours of actual mental work a day and the rest is autopilot 
[10:14:27] <MootPoot> Not sure if that is the case but I've found it to be true 
[10:14:36] <redempt1on> IU'
[10:14:43] <redempt1on> I'm sipping on that sizzurp
[10:14:44] <MootPoot> Once I learn a thing it goes into autopilot and I can do it forever but 
[10:14:50] <redempt1on> they don't know I got the niner with the full clip
[10:15:09] <MootPoot> If I have to learn something or improve a skill, first 3 to 4 hours of the morning is the absolute best time 
[10:15:15] <PancakeMatsuri> depends on the kind of work, but if it's taxing, 8 pomo per day is more or less ok
[10:15:34] <PancakeMatsuri> more would lead to burnout, I think
[10:17:34] <redempt1on> You know what my favorite Anime movie is? ...
[10:17:37] <MootPoot> for me personally at least I feel like working from home has massively improved producivity
[10:17:40] <redempt1on> ...making money on the internet.
[10:17:54] <MootPoot> since beforehand I was wasting those precious 4 hours in the morning
[10:18:05] <MootPoot> getting up, getting ready, going to work/school 
[10:18:14] <MootPoot> vs having all 4 at my disposal
[10:19:01] <PancakeMatsuri> MootPoot, I'm also async, so I don't get interrupted
[10:19:14] <MootPoot> can you give me the power 
[10:19:29] <PancakeMatsuri> the power of async?
[10:19:35] <MootPoot> mental async
[10:20:00] <MootPoot> I've found that interupting my autopilot tasks has no downside
[10:20:11] <PancakeMatsuri> ah, my client is in EST. We overlap, when it's 11pm-night
[10:20:15] <MootPoot> but my brain tasks getting interuptted leads me to have to rethink the entire thing
[10:20:25] <MootPoot> of whatever I was thinking about
[10:20:55] <PancakeMatsuri> I'm someone who doesn't have that problem. Unless I'm interrupted into another task.
[10:21:36] <PancakeMatsuri> but also, I think I don't suffer much from interruptions like pomo rest
[10:21:46] <PancakeMatsuri> I don't have much in my head
[10:22:08] <PancakeMatsuri> like, I need to make config errors fatal
[10:22:13] <PancakeMatsuri> that's simple
[10:22:42] <MootPoot> it sounds like that task to you is what I would call an "autopilot" task
[10:22:49] <MootPoot> where you dont have to think about it
[10:22:51] <PancakeMatsuri> ah, ok
[10:23:01] <PancakeMatsuri> so what's a brain task?
[10:23:21] <MootPoot> brain task for me would be...say figuring out a leetcode problem that I've never seen before
[10:23:33] <MootPoot> and I have no basis or experience to rely on to solve it
[10:23:56] <PancakeMatsuri> what about at work?
[10:24:12] <MootPoot> I dont follow
[10:24:31] <PancakeMatsuri> do you have an example of actual work?
[10:24:37] <PancakeMatsuri> that's a brain task
[10:24:41] <MootPoot> actual work?
[10:24:44] <MootPoot> uh...yes
[10:24:48] <PancakeMatsuri> well, real work
[10:24:59] <MootPoot> do you mean like a acutal software project thing
[10:25:02] <PancakeMatsuri> I can't relate to leetcode
[10:25:02] <MootPoot> or something I was paid for
[10:25:17] <PancakeMatsuri> well, anything that's not a test 
[10:25:19] <MootPoot> oh, okay
[10:25:43] <MootPoot> then an actual "brain" task would be say, planning out and designing the architecture of a new application
[10:25:49] <MootPoot> before you write any code
[10:26:10] <PancakeMatsuri> well, I suck at that
[10:26:15] <MootPoot> although in that case I think its a mix of autopilot and brain
[10:26:32] <PancakeMatsuri> I let TDD drive me
[10:26:45] <MootPoot> since some links are obvious and practiced ( this page -> sends db query -> etc ) 
[10:26:57] <MootPoot> but others are hidden and you have to really think about the edge cases
[10:27:05] <MootPoot> PancakeMatsuri: I've never done TDD
[10:27:05] <PancakeMatsuri> ah
[10:27:15] <PancakeMatsuri> I just don't do it that way
[10:27:24] <Sadale> nya~ :3
[10:27:36] <PancakeMatsuri> thinking of all edge cases is anti-TDD
[10:27:44] * Sadale still couldn't figure out how to use the prostate massager that he purchased a couple of weeks ago for providing stimulation.
[10:27:49] <MootPoot> its how I was taught at uni
[10:27:52] <MootPoot> Sadale: what
[10:27:56] <MootPoot> does it come with a manual
[10:27:57] <MootPoot> lol
[10:28:06] <PancakeMatsuri> MootPoot, I scored like 100% on Toptal algo test, all thanks to TDD
[10:28:15] <Sadale> MootPoot, It's in Japanese. I tried reading it using Google Translate. Still it ain't working. to me. :3
[10:28:31] <MootPoot> make amigo translate it for you LMAO
[10:28:38] <PancakeMatsuri> MootPoot, TDD lets you have less in your brain
[10:29:29] <Sadale> MootPoot, Plus, I'm not trynig to use it as how it's intended to be used. The massager is meant to be used for super orgasm. Meanwhile, I wanted to use it for milking out cum for maximum frustration for lulz. Anyway I couldn't figure out how to use it at all. Not for super orgasm, not for milking.
[10:30:15] <MootPoot> at that point just go to an S&M club Sadale 
[10:30:17] <Sadale> Urchin[emacs], ^ :(
[10:30:28] <MootPoot> PancakeMatsuri: might need to dig into that
[10:30:33] <Sadale> MootPoot, lol no thanks. I'd like to stay virgin. And I don't want to risk getting STD

Again, to-do lists are a highly individual thing. Many swear by having only 3 tasks on their list every day (obviously larger tasks) and others do best by having very long and detailed lists.

[10:34:45] <MootPoot> reading this description of TDD, it seems like TDD dosen't have much to do with the design overall
[10:34:51] <MootPoot> just the actual work itself
[10:35:11] <MootPoot> actual unit of work*
[10:35:19] <Sadale> I still haven't figured out how to do TDD. Anyway using TDD slows my development so I just don't bother using it :P
[10:35:39] <MootPoot> it looks simple enough - although I dont really know how to use a testing suite 
[10:35:44] <PancakeMatsuri> MootPoot, well, TDD can drive design. It's an easy way.
[10:35:51] <MootPoot> can it?
[10:35:56] <PancakeMatsuri> sure it can
[10:36:07] <PancakeMatsuri> in the ways you can't predict
[10:36:09] <MootPoot> dont you create the design - assign out units of work, then use TDD for those 
[10:36:16] <MootPoot> can you give me an example

[11:59:57] <MootPoot> well, the reason I gained weight was bascially due to mild depression fucking with my overall energy levels, lack of sleep and a almost completely carb based diet
[12:00:11] <MootPoot> I go through carbs really quick 
[12:00:14] <DunceCotus> ah I see
[12:00:30] <DunceCotus> comfort eating?
[12:00:31] <MootPoot> so when the energy drop happens when the carb sugar is gone, I get cranky and tired, and over time I learned the way to fix that was by eating
[12:00:39] <MootPoot> to get energy back up
[12:01:04] <MootPoot> so my day would bascially be a spike graph 
[12:01:16] <MootPoot> spike when I eat, decline to 0
[12:01:33] <MootPoot> instead of a solid line that slowly declines like most people
[12:01:55] <MootPoot> so when I learned that eating again made me feel not tired anymore - I kept doing it
[12:02:06] <MootPoot> which resulted in more calories in then out

[12:06:02] <MootPoot> how
[12:06:10] <DunceCotus> I don't know
[12:06:11] <MootPoot> metamucil is a fiber suppliment
[12:06:15] <MootPoot> not a laxative
[12:06:22] <MootPoot> it does the opposite of give you diareeha
[12:06:31] <DunceCotus> hmm ok
[12:07:09] <DunceCotus> coffee gives me diarrhea
[12:07:21] <DunceCotus> or rather "The shits"
[12:07:24] <MootPoot> sure its the coffee and not the milk?

[12:23:32] <redempt1on> but drinking liquids is cool
[12:23:43] <DunceCotus> redempt1on: I once had a dream where people ate where they shat
[12:23:57] <DunceCotus> like there were dining tables in the bathrooms
[12:24:09] <redempt1on> I think I saw a film abou that once...
[12:24:10] <MootPoot> I've had lunch while on the toilet
[12:24:21] <MootPoot> I dont see what the deal is
[12:24:27] <DunceCotus> good gravy
[12:24:55] <DunceCotus> also in that same dream there were these big machines in the bathrooms that would electrocute your dick
[12:25:00] <DunceCotus> not sure why but it was an option
[12:25:25] <redempt1on> The "Butthead" scene from Society...
[12:25:38] <redempt1on> is exactly what you speak of . yes
[12:25:48] <DunceCotus> I've seen that movie 
[12:26:03] <redempt1on> And also perphaps Human Centipeded.
[12:26:08] <redempt1on> Centipede*
[12:26:21] <DunceCotus> also you could go completely nude to university lectures
[12:26:32] <DunceCotus> quite the free-range society
[12:27:00] <redempt1on> Sorry, it goes against Islam.
[12:27:03] <redempt1on> not permittted
[12:27:11] <redempt1on> ... and you don't dare speak out against Islam now.
[12:27:14] <DunceCotus> or does islam go against free-range
[12:28:20] <DunceCotus> there was this adonis of a guy sitting buck naked behind me in the lecture (in dream)
[12:28:26] <DunceCotus> perfect civilisation
[12:30:25] <redempt1on> I'm pretty strange... but as far as fantasies go, it's shemales... not naked guys sitting behind me listening to lecture on Sumerian mythology.... just saying.
[12:30:31] <amigojapan> Tomako promised we would watch anime today and she is breaking her promise
[12:32:11] <DunceCotus> redempt1on: actually it was a lecture on game design I think
[12:32:22] <DunceCotus> and the game was like hyper-realistic, evolution sim
[12:32:25] <DunceCotus> really really cool
[12:33:00] <DunceCotus> redempt1on: I don't mind me shemales either
[12:33:07] <DunceCotus> in fact this adonis was kinda femme
[12:33:25] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: did you tell her off
[12:33:49] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: she said she does not feel like it now
[12:34:15] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: we are listening to Vivaldi instead

[13:57:03] <amigojapan> Because of white space errors
[13:57:11] <MootPoot> ?
[13:57:15] <MootPoot> that's still a thing?
[13:57:22] <amigojapan> Yep
[13:57:25] <MootPoot> your compiler should take care of that for you
[13:57:35] <MootPoot> or your IDE should notify you easily
[13:57:52] <MootPoot> I think VScode has a setting or something to show grey dots for every white space character

[14:05:01] <Macer> mickey rourke ... looks like an alien 
[14:05:19] <MootPoot> learn to completely navigate everything on my computer only though the keyboard
[14:05:25] <Macer> wtf happened to him. jackson syndrome?
[14:06:19] <Macer> MootPoot: is that even possible nowadays?
[14:06:37] <MootPoot> Macer: I've already set it all up
[14:06:40] <Macer> i mean at least in a ui heh
[14:06:44] <MootPoot> takes a little tweaking but
[14:06:45] <Macer> i can see using a console 
[14:06:46] <MootPoot> In a UI
[14:06:56] <MootPoot> just normal win10
[14:07:11] <MootPoot> with the proper extensions in place and a few helper tools its more then possible
[14:07:15] <Macer> i even use a mouse when using ssh heh
[14:07:20] <MootPoot> lol
[14:07:30] <amigojapan> Macer: that is what guis like ratpoison claim to do
[14:07:34] <Macer> like.. you can click on which window you want in tmux 
[14:07:39] <Macer> since terminals have mouse support lol
[14:07:48] <MootPoot> the only thing I need is a shortcut that goes like one word back or a fast reverse to make quick fixes to whatever I'm writing
[14:08:02] <MootPoot> OH
[14:08:14] <MootPoot> you can already do that with alt+left/right
[14:08:20] <Macer> sure
[14:08:29] <MootPoot> so if you can do that then that solves my last nitpick
[14:08:32] <Macer> but..... i mean.... if i can just click on it
[14:08:40] <amigojapan> MootPoot: didn't Ctrl+backspace do that?
[14:08:56] <MootPoot> its just a speed/convenience thing
[14:09:03] <MootPoot> keyboard beats mout

[14:12:33] <MootPoot> amigojapan: there is a extension for chrome that you might like
[14:12:38] <MootPoot> you use chromium right?
[14:12:47] <MootPoot> I think extensions should still work on it

[14:13:04] <MootPoot> once you get used to it you can navigate all you want without a mouse
[14:13:08] <MootPoot> faster too
[14:13:26] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I have used it, but it does not let do everything
[14:13:37] <MootPoot> what does it not do?
[14:13:54] <MootPoot> I haven't tried it full time so 
[14:13:57] <MootPoot> idk 100%
[14:14:21] <MootPoot> for stuff like browser commands I'll just use my browser shortcuts
[14:14:52] <amigojapan> MootPoot: like some pages expect certain key combinations, but that programs replaces those with it's own combos, and you can't use that program
[14:15:01] <MootPoot> hmm
[14:15:08] <MootPoot> you mean like flash games?
[14:15:18] <MootPoot> or browser games where they want specific key combos
[14:15:57] <amigojapan> Those too and there are web apps that expect key combos too

[14:37:54] <Satin> My ASUS ROG laptop fucked up yesterday.
[14:37:55] <Macer> not like i game on it
[14:37:58] <Satin> Day before yesterday*
[14:38:04] <Satin> the fans are going crazy.

[14:38:47] <Satin> Macer: No it's not about running it so hot. The left side fan is literally acting like that. It's gone I believe.
[14:38:59] <Satin> My brother told me it's because I kept my laptop on every night or whatever. I'm not sure.
[14:39:12] <amigojapan> Macer: do you update the OS to the latest?
[14:39:22] <Macer> oh
[14:39:24] <Macer> that's just a borked fan
[14:39:31] <Satin> But now that laptop, with its RTX 2060, 24 GB RAM, Ryzen 7 4800HS.... is just sitting underneath my table :(
[14:39:39] <Satin> Macer: Yeah and I'm too much of a pussy to change the fan myself.
[14:39:50] <Satin> The fan costs like $30 for two apparently.
[14:39:50] <Macer> amigojapan: i can't anymore 
[14:39:55] * Satin doesn't mess with hardware.......
[14:40:12] <amigojapan> I see Macer 
[14:40:26] <Macer> amigojapan: seems like big sur is the last this ancient mbp will support haha
[14:40:47] <amigojapan> Macer: it's a good Linux machine when all support is dropped
[14:40:51] <Macer> i think they're going to send out minor security updates for another year 
[14:40:55] <Macer> yeah
[14:40:56] <redempt1on> Macbook is the wack, book.
[14:40:59] <redempt1on> cant play PC games
[14:41:05] <Macer> but fk that. i want a macbook :) i'd rather use macos than linux
[14:41:18] <Macer> so in a year when it is finally done with i will just get whatever iteration of their arm series they're on
[14:41:32] <redempt1on> I has an iPad and iPhone but I'm an autistic virgin with one testicle so I still need Windows 11 for my vid games
[14:41:34] <Macer> redempt1on: i have an xbox for games :P 
[14:41:50] <amigojapan> Macer: Apple fan boy
[14:42:03] <Macer> amigojapan: i'd def rather run apple products than win10/11 
[14:42:10] <Macer> macos is the happy middle
[14:42:17] <Macer> and well. fuck google. :) 
[14:42:19] <Satin> I support Macer 's choice
[14:42:43] <Macer> win10 is ugly af with its giant titlebars and clunky movement
[14:43:02] <Macer> i mean i have a VM just in case i need to do somethign in windows but it's really rare for me to use it
[14:43:16] <amigojapan> Macer: they are forcing you to buy a new computer they planned obsolesce
[14:43:24] <Macer> amigojapan: 10 years? 
[14:43:28] <redempt1on> Win10 is awesome, great
[14:43:31] <Macer> i bought it new in 2013
[14:43:32] <redempt1on> stable
[14:43:32] <Satin> I don't think it's that cynical 
[14:43:35] <amigojapan> Yes Macer 
[14:43:37] <Macer> so that's about right lol
[14:43:41] <Satin> a situation
[14:43:47] <Macer> i mean i can't think of many laptops that i'd keep for 10+ years
[14:43:52] <Macer> this is the first one
[14:43:53] <Macer> lol
[14:43:56] <redempt1on> Laptops suck. limited to upgrade
[14:44:26] <redempt1on> when ppl come over they're like "wow this nikkuh got a 32" monitor, tower, desk, kb, mouse, speaker,etc... this nikkuh be living 20 years ago"
[14:44:28] <Macer> and i bet i can ebay it to someone who wants something cheap for linux with an awesome screen
[14:44:29] <Satin> it's pretty amazing it lasted for 10 years
[14:44:43] <amigojapan> Macer: it's still planned obsolesce. No matter where it lasted long or not
[14:45:20] <Macer> amigojapan: sure i guess. but as opposed to what? shit hardware in something else that is unplanned obsolescence 
[14:45:34] <Satin> I don't think you should be a stickler about it amigo, someone paid for it, and got what they wanted out of it
[14:45:37] <Macer> or breaks because it's cheap heh
[14:45:42] <Satin> for a reasonable satisfactory amount of time
[14:45:57] <amigojapan> Macer: as opposed to Linux which still supports 32bit hardware
[14:45:59] <Macer> i think 10 years is a great stretch. especially for a laptop 
[14:46:03] <Satin> I understand you don't like alleged planned obsolence but you're up against someone who is satisfied
[14:46:17] <Macer> amigojapan: i could always just use some hackery way to get monterey on it

[14:47:06] <Macer> but i think it's time anyways. this thing is dated and it is showing its age especially in the gpu

[14:55:01] <amigojapan> Anyone can do that
[14:56:38] <Bco1981> depends on how expensive it is...
[14:56:57] <amigojapan> Bco1981: a new MacBook is too expensive
[14:57:10] <Satin> a new macbook is pretty decent heh
[14:57:10] <Bco1981> yes
[14:57:13] <Satin> pretty reliable
[14:57:20] <Bco1981> i agree with amigojapan 
[14:57:27] <Satin> Bco1981: it's no longer a true idea anyways
[14:57:35] <Satin> Bco1981: macbooks are about the same price as their counterparts these days
[14:57:39] <Bco1981> it will reliably have a meltdown yes
[14:57:42] <Satin> and it's not really that "overpriced"
[14:57:43] <Satin> nah.
[14:57:57] <Satin> Bco1981: my 2015 macbook is still doing fine, minus the hinge slightly and the N key not working
[14:58:00] <Satin> hardware
[14:58:05] <Satin> is functioning as it was before tbh
[14:58:26] <Satin> i only ever used windows on bootcamp with it but yeah lol
[15:00:03] <Satin> I don't like the apple ecosystem more, but the idea that macbooks are overpriced these days is a myth
[15:00:20] <Satin> just look at the price of gaming laptops or Dell XPS lmao
[15:00:20] <Bco1981> it's overpriced because, the cooling isn't there. so they have to limit cpu performance. so if you test a macbook against a pc laptop with exact same cpu, the pc will be outperforming the macbook. since you end up paying more for the macbook because of "design" you will be paying overprice, compared to what you actually get out of the product.
[15:00:37] <Satin> these days, M1 will outperform the PC entirely
[15:00:45] <Satin> so not sure about that one
[15:01:01] <Satin> for a roughly equiv CPU, the M1 will be better, and be more cooler
[15:01:07] <Bco1981> true the M1 is good.
[15:02:18] <Bco1981> but i would still go with a pc, that i can actually fix. and make sure i can buy one that has proper cooling.
[15:02:55] <amigojapan> Bco1981: don't forget you can't even run Linux natively except on a VM on the m1
[15:03:41] <Satin> Bco1981: I mean yeah, I would often too, but I won't act like an elitist and not recognize why other people like macbooks or spread false rumours about it being overpriced :P
[15:03:44] <amigojapan> It may change in the future, but not with the help of Apple
[15:04:22] <Satin> It's pretty damm good for what you pay, if you have the expectations most Apple owners want. I can't blame them, and by jove, I might someday get an M1 at this rate
[15:04:47] <Satin> I love laptops but they consistently disappoint me with hardware issues. I've owned so many Dells, an ASUS or two, Lenovo, etc.
[15:04:57] <Satin> And the macbook is still the one standing so far.
[15:05:11] * Satin bought a Dell Latitude in an attempt to replicate that sort of durability, let's see how far this goes!
[15:05:14] <amigojapan> Satin: you are totally in the evil hold of Apple with the M1
[15:05:26] <Satin> amigojapan: nope, I don't agree with this position in the slightest
[15:05:28] <Satin> "evil hold" lol
[15:05:55] <amigojapan> Satin: you can only install Linux thru a VM
[15:05:58] <Satin> amigojapan: it's one of the best CPUs on the planet at this time, it's marvelous. Apple users don't have any jitters unlike linux or Windows desktop users at this time.
[15:06:06] <Satin> amigojapan: then don't use linux on it?
[15:06:10] <isekaijin> amigojapan: What's wrong with the M1?
[15:06:24] <Satin> isekaijin: He has an ideological shtlick to push here.
[15:06:26] <Bco1981> amigojapan: we can't deny that the M1 based model actually did out performe the same gen intel and amd laptops in various tasks.
[15:06:47] <amigojapan> Satin: that is the evil hold. The user does not control the software on their computer
[15:06:52] <isekaijin> Satin: amigojapan doesn't strike me as a very ideological person on these matters.
[15:07:03] <Satin> isekaijin: He is.
[15:07:18] <Satin> isekaijin: I don't like his position. I'm generally pro libre software and what not, but not with this sort of attitude of not even acknowledging or understanding why other users might go with their choices etc. It's pretty reasonable for them.
[15:07:27] <amigojapan> isekaijin: you can't run Linux bare metal on my yet
[15:07:46] <Satin> "oh it can't run Linux, so therefore it's bad and all of these positives that others find in it don't matter"
[15:07:47] <Bco1981> but yeah, the mac Os isn't exactly FOSS... looking at you, Satin ...
[15:08:13] <Satin> Bco1981: Like I said, I ran Windows bootcamped when I was forced to use a MacBook a bit ago :)

[15:08:45] <Satin> the hardware quality was great
[15:09:24] <Satin> Anyways, amigo's position is very disagreeable on this. Most users are pragmatic and I don't blame them for it.
[15:09:58] <amigojapan> Satin: you are talking about an Intel Mac
[15:10:20] <Satin> amigojapan: and the M1 is highly praised and critically acclaimed by both users and critics
[15:10:35] <Satin> You should at the very least acknowledge they are getting what they want out of it.
[15:11:05] <amigojapan> Satin: forget about bootcamp on M1
[15:11:49] <amigojapan> They are blocking such things
[15:11:57] <isekaijin> amigojapan: Are there no free software compilers targeting the M1?
[15:12:32] <amigojapan> No isekaijin and Apple is not opening up their specs
[15:12:43] <isekaijin> Wait, what?
[15:13:22] <isekaijin> amigojapan: So you are saying that the M1 is an architecture impossible to target for compilers, without doing some reverse engineering?
[15:13:32] <isekaijin> That sounds really bad.
[15:13:37] <Satin> amigojapan: that's Microsoft's fault, not apple re: bootcamp on M1
[15:13:44] <amigojapan> isekaijin: it needs to be reverse engineered
[15:14:07] <isekaijin> Satin: Why would it be Microsoft's fault in this case? Or rather, what do you think Microsoft should do instead?
[15:14:11] <amigojapan> It's Apple blocking it Satin 
[15:14:17] <Satin> nope. amigojapan 
[15:14:24] <Satin> amigojapan: Microsoft has an exclusive deal with Qualcomm regarding licensing windows on ARM chips. They can't provide Windows natively to other ARM chip makers.

[15:15:18] <Satin> It's you who's spreading misinformation regarding this matter.
[15:15:28] <amigojapan> Satin: that has nothing to do with running Linux native on bare metal on m1
[15:16:05] <Satin> Dude. You were the one that said they are blocking bootcamp.
[15:16:09] <Satin> amigojapan> Ask Me Satin: forget about bootcamp on M1
[15:16:09] <Satin> 5:41 AM They are blocking such things
[15:16:20] <amigojapan> They are
[15:16:24] <Satin> So I'm responding with evidence that you are incorrect. Now you're changing it to it being about linux? What.
[15:16:45] <Satin> No. It's Microsoft being unable to provide any sort of support for Windows on non-Qualcomm ARM chips, per contract.
[15:16:47] <isekaijin> amigojapan: Mmm, a quick Google search shows that there are free software compilers targeting the M1.
[15:16:48] <Bco1981> you don't need bootcamp to run linux on a mac ?
[15:16:51] <amigojapan> Bootcamp can also work for Linux
[15:16:53] <Satin> isekaijin: true.
[15:17:19] <Satin> amigojapan: Bootcamp is primarily meant for Windows, not Linux.
[15:17:32] <amigojapan> isekaijin: link me to a Linux distro that runs on my bare metal
[15:17:36] <Satin> Apple's official marketing will state as such as well. So will the wikipedia page.
[15:17:57] <amigojapan> Satin: that's bs
[15:17:58] <Satin> isekaijin: Yeah amigo is incorrect about that as well, there are free software compilers that work with M1 indeed.

[15:18:53] <Satin> Nowhere do I see "Linux" in the intro here. It is primarily meant for Windows, NOT Linux.
[15:18:58] <amigojapan> Satin: many people use it to boot Linux
[15:19:16] <Satin> ok. good for them. they are not using it in the way that the developer of the software intends or provides support for.
[15:20:01] <Satin> me raising the point earlier that it's Microsoft's fault for not providing Windows support for non-Qualcomm ARM chips, and thus affecting M1's bootcamp  abilities still stands.

[15:21:48] <isekaijin> But not on the M1 Mac itself.
[15:22:15] <amigojapan> isekaijin: apparently you can run Ubuntu now
[15:22:23] <Satin> isekaijin: Yep, because linux currently can't be installed on an M1 Mac. Neither can Windows. It's a new ARM chip, new architecture etc.
[15:23:20] <amigojapan> isekaijin: nevermind that's also on a VM
[15:24:48] <isekaijin> Personally, I don't like dual booting (because you need to reboot just to run different programs), and I also don't see any point to buying a Mac if you don't like macOS.
[15:25:36] <amigojapan> isekaijin: it's more about not being caught in macos which is proprietary
[15:28:03] <isekaijin> With the amount I spent on gacha last year, I could've probably bought an M1 MacBook. But I wonder if there would be any real value to such a purchase.

[15:44:19] <isekaijin> amigojapan: If Linux hasn't been ported to the M1, that isn't really the M1's fault.
[15:44:25] <amigojapan> I see Miyukii 
[15:44:50] <Miyukii> and I don't think there are many useful cli programs for mac that weren't opensource in the first place
[15:44:57] <isekaijin> amigojapan: Unless you have evidence that Apple is deliberately making this port difficult.
[15:45:23] <amigojapan> isekaijin: I think I heard of a special chip to prevent it, let me look it up
[15:46:00] <zoidberg> I like apple ipads

Doesn't Linux run on almost every processor in the world from 80386s to IBM s390x to SPARC? Hasn't¬†Linux been running on the ARM family since 1995? Yes and yes. But, in earlier cases, Linux developers had access to the chip's firmware, microcode, and 
[15:50:28] <amigojapan> documentation. That's not the case with the M1

[17:57:46] <Sallan65> lmao
[17:57:50] <Sallan65> thats a good one
[17:58:49] <hans> interestingly that market is only ~14 kilometers from the "Wuhan Institute of Virology", containing China's first "biosafety level 4 laboratory", where coronaviruses has been studied for a long time prior to the outbreak... 
[17:59:21] <hans> combine that with "China refused to let WHO study the area", i think China is trying to hide a leak.. why else would they refuse WHO access? 
[17:59:29] <emmeka> hans yes thanks for sharing conspiracy theory fodder everyone has known for 2 years now.
[17:59:31] <Sallan65> either storie could be true
[17:59:48] <Satin> I think the lab leak theory is plausible, I don't know about the exact details of what has been confirmed so far.
[18:00:08] <Satin> But it doesn't make a difference towards worldwide efforts to combat COVID-19. And there's no evidence that it was an intentional bioweapon.
[18:00:12] <emmeka> the WHO's conclusion is this: either origin (natural outbreak at the wet market, or lab leak that infected animals at the wet market) is plausible
[18:00:19] <emmeka> but there's no way to get an answer
[18:00:23] <Satin> ^^
[18:00:23] <hans> well the lab leak theory will never be confirmed, if evidence ever existed, it has surely been destroyed by the CCP long ago
[18:00:30] <emmeka> even assuming the Chinese cooperated, it probably wouldn't tell us much
[18:01:14] <Sallan65> its probably not a bioweapon, but people are certinly taking avantage of the virus
[18:01:37] <emmeka> and yeah, the one thing we are certain of is that whatever research might've leaked this, it was probably benign and not scary bioweapon stuff. The facility was civilian and not in any way classified.

[18:13:48] <emmeka> Sallan65 people who want to be dependant on the government... like red states?
[18:14:19] <darkwitch> there is a big world outside the united states
[18:14:40] <Sallan65> why I said Convertives
[18:15:24] <emmeka> I've spent a lot of time in the US but one thing I'll never quite grasp is the sort of degeneracy that causes someone to look at their society where capital has run amok and done lots of crazy shit that makes shit dire in ways it doesn't anywhere else on earth, and think, you know what we need? more power in the hands of capital.
[18:15:31] <Sallan65> unless your in Austrailia, where the Liberal party takes the role of the Convsertives
[18:16:08] <emmeka> I mean I do get it actually, the culture of individualism, self-improvement and independence that defines your country fosters these ideas and all
[18:16:10] <sentionics> imagine if all gov was senti. We'd all be...
[18:16:13] <sentionics> something.
[18:16:14] <emmeka> but it's still bizarre to me
[18:16:28] <Satin> it's delusional
[18:16:37] <darkwitch> very bizarre, I agree
[18:16:39] <Sallan65> emmeka alot of those ideals come from england
[18:16:48] <emmeka> Sallan65 as if that's an improvement
[18:17:01] <emmeka> look, anything that comes from England is objectively bad. Englishmen? bad.
[18:17:16] <Sallan65> and likly even predate england its self
[18:17:18] <Satin> English accents are charming
[18:18:00] <Satin> Sallan65: I just hope you actually rethink the consequences and ground reality of what happens with these sort of arrangments
[18:18:18] <Satin> and don't get caught up in all the good-sounding-rethoric that is anti this and anti that, and all about individual control
[18:18:24] <darkwitch> maybe it would be better to split the country in two. then people from each side could live only with like minded people
[18:18:31] <Satin> darkwitch: no
[18:18:46] <emmeka> the ironic part about the United States to me is that, as someone who lives in a confederal country, I think your federal government is actually overpowered.
[18:18:47] <darkwitch> no, there would be endless arguments on how to split it
[18:18:57] <Sallan65> there is some specualtion that the ideas of individialism and libertatianism comes from acient germanic tribes
[18:19:08] <emmeka> like here the powers of the federal government are quite small, and provinces have the power to override them.
[18:19:10] <Sallan65> however they did not write anything down so we don't know
[18:19:19] <emmeka> ancient germanic tribes lol
[18:19:22] <Satin> lol
[18:19:29] <Satin> also
[18:19:42] <emmeka> that's about as useful of an observation as stating that Republicanism originated in Athens and Rome
[18:19:50] <Satin> emmeka: federal government here isn't really overpowered in my opinion when it comes to states vs feds.
[18:20:03] <Satin> the vaccine mandate's biggest issues in courts are coming from that sort of divide
[18:20:06] <Satin> federal*
[18:20:15] <Sallan65> the Federal system comes from the Persians
[18:20:16] <emmeka> Satin I'd say so. At least from my perspective. Your federal government has a lot of powers that ours doesn't.
[18:20:20] <Satin> courts are upholding city/state mandates, but not the federal one
[18:20:23] <Satin> emmeka: I see
[18:20:41] <Sallan65> Alot of our governing systems come from Persians 
[18:20:49] <Satin> Sallan65: ........... okay

[18:21:26] <emmeka> Satin as an example, provinces here can opt out of our version of social security, they also run entirely their own labour law systems, they can have their own immigration systems, and often just outright ignore the federal government to do things as they please
[18:21:58] * darkwitch sprinkles persian rose petals on Sallan65

[18:22:39] <ImoutoBot> [youtube] Why The Persians Should Be The Good Guys In '300' - Hilarious Helmet History #1 | Duration: 5 minutes, 42 seconds
[18:22:42] <emmeka> I mean I prefer it. Not that this is a libertarian paradise. But power rests in the hands of local authorities, not national ones.
[18:23:00] <Satin> I'm not opposed to it per se, but I don't see it working out in the US really.
[18:23:07] <Sallan65> what country are you from emmeka
[18:23:08] <emmeka> Satin otoh, we have a system that might make US states scream: the equalization payments
[18:23:27] <Satin> I'm fine with federal authority expanding a bit where necessary. Not recklessly obviously and not just going over the states.
[18:23:45] <Satin> But where it makes sense, like unified healthcare and what not. Fragmented stuff is proving to be a headache for us in terms of policy.
[18:23:48] <emmeka> Satin provinces here have their tax revenues equalized. As in, the feds redistribute taxes collected from all provinces based on the economy of each province.
[18:24:01] <Satin> emmeka: lol
[18:24:07] <emmeka> rich provinces pay more than they get, poor provinces get more than they pay
[18:24:13] <Sallan65> nvm that sounds like Canada
[18:24:19] <emmeka> they're called "have and have-not provinces"
[18:24:21] <Satin> Sallan65: correct
[18:24:22] <emmeka> Sallan65 yeah.
[18:24:33] <Satin> emmeka: that somewhat happens in the US too. Just not in such a direct way.
[18:24:48] <emmeka> right. it's much more blunt here.
[18:25:24] <Satin> Mississippi and New Mexico are some of the more poorer states, but are partly afloat because of federal programs. None of it is reckless or easily given though as far as I follow the politics here.
[18:25:43] <emmeka> Satin there is some controversy about it. So like the formula for all this takes into account energy wealth, oil, electricity, etc that the government gets money from
[18:25:46] <Satin> Besides of course, laws in mosts states requiring that our spending be equal be what we collect or whatever
[18:25:53] <Sallan65> I have a friend in Canada. Problem there is the Federal goverment keeps consintrating power to the PMO's office and Cabinate. where as in the past it was all in the Commitiees 
[18:26:05] <Satin> so the fed budget can have a deficit but not on the state level
[18:26:11] <Sallan65> aswell at permiers
[18:26:18] <emmeka> QC has *massive* hydroelectric generation, but, they intentionally price their electricity very low to benefit Quebeckers and break even on electricity generation
[18:26:25] <emmeka> this results in QC being a have-not province
[18:26:29] <Sallan65> and consertives whine about it, but do nothing to change it
[18:26:32] <Satin> *I was looking for the word break even for what i just said
[18:26:36] <Sallan65> like Republicans in the US
[18:26:40] <Satin> emmeka: i see
[18:26:50] <emmeka> as opposed to AB, which sells all the oil on the open market, and then owes money in equalization payments
[18:26:58] <emmeka> ofc AB could do the same thing, but doesn't.
[18:27:25] <Satin> wild
[18:27:38] <emmeka> Sallan65 the PMO has relatively little power compared to the president.
[18:28:01] <Sallan65> On paper yes
[18:28:20] <emmeka> the federal government's powers are clearly delineated here, and not very substantial except in terms of international relations
[18:29:05] <Satin> I'm for the federal programs being expanded here/authority over some more stuff in some cases, as long as it's done carefully and for things that benefit people.
[18:29:17] * sentionics hugs emmeka.
[18:29:18] <Satin> Leaving it in the hands of states isn't proving to be an effective strategy
[18:29:23] <emmeka> Sallan65 we run into lol situations like provinces blockading each other or disputing each other's borders or disputing the federal government's power at all, and the feds can't really do anything about it
[18:29:45] <Satin> Also, we have more states than Canada does provineces I assume
[18:29:47] <Sallan65> if I remember correctly, the Governor general has all the power. and is a puppet of the OM
[18:29:50] <Sallan65> PM*
[18:29:59] <Satin> s/provineces/provinces/ 
[18:30:11] <emmeka> nominally speaking the governor general has the power to convene and dismiss federal parliament.
[18:30:14] <sentionics> had a drink or two, but hope you're alright here, emmeka 
[18:30:27] * Satin throws sentionics into space and back
[18:30:40] * sentionics found a beer in space
[18:30:41] <emmeka> Sallan65 which, they have exercised this power precisely once in my lifetime. Prorogue crisis, 2009.
[18:30:59] <emmeka> Sallan65 but regardless this affects federal parliament, not the relation between the feds and provinces.
[18:31:21] <emmeka> the governor general has no power over the provinces, each province has its own lieutenant governor appointed by the premier instead.
[18:31:29] <Sallan65> I also heard that citys have no power on paper too
[18:31:52] <emmeka> this is true, municipal government is derivative of provincial authority.
[18:32:21] <emmeka> provinces can and have basically fucked municipal governments out of shit
[18:32:23] <Sallan65> my friends from Toronto, and they tried to but a toll on one of the freeways owned by the city, and they said province said no
[18:32:34] <emmeka> oh, it's not owned by the city.
[18:32:37] <emmeka> it's owned by the province.
[18:32:38] <Satin> states fuck cities over, but there's a fair bit of court cases that'll happen

[18:34:49] <emmeka> it's under a stupidly long lease or something
[18:35:03] <emmeka> yeah, it was. but then it was a private toll highway we got a bad deal on.
[18:35:13] <Sallan65> it was one of the left leaning partys that finialized the sale too
[18:35:22] <emmeka> hmmm no it wasn't
[18:35:34] <emmeka> I believe that was during Harris' time? Provincial Tories.
[18:35:50] <emmeka> he was famous for the "common sense revolution" as he called it, a mass wave of privatizations and austerity
[18:35:57] <emmeka> you'd have gotten along. small-government guy.
[18:36:04] <emmeka> he was terrible.
[18:36:04] <Sallan65> he likes that guy
[18:36:34] <Sallan65> he also said that the Federal Liberal party has slashing the budget at the same time
[18:36:38] <Sallan65> was*
[18:36:57] <emmeka> they were. it was the time when austerity was in vogue
[18:37:02] <Sallan65> and they got a free pass
[18:37:14] <emmeka> hardly, Harper came into power not long after
[18:37:17] <Sallan65> becuase they are always on the "right side" of history
[18:37:24] <emmeka> on a platform of ~balancing the books~
[18:38:40] <emmeka> Sallan65 it's hard to explain the phenomenon of the Liberal Party to an American, they are less of a movement or ideology and more of an institution

[18:41:34] <emmeka> in a sense that's accurate, but they're more of a generational force than anything. The liberals are embedded in basically every old institution of this country and win because of the pull they have on certain types of people, people whose parents voted liberal, and their parents before them, and so on.

[22:58:54] <paine> i just think the pornography thing is weird, that's all
[23:04:39] <Urchin[emacs]> paine: that's an incest show (well they don't go all the way, but...)
[23:05:41] <paine> incest is definitely illegal

[23:09:12] <ButterNoodle> wait
[23:10:05] <Urchin[emacs]> ##anime successfully turned weird and disturbing, job done
[23:10:10] <paine> we played ffxiv together a bit but i think it was beyond his skill level he liked minecraft more
[23:10:17] <paine> did it only just turn weird and disturbing?
[23:10:24] <paine> it's kind of been that way the brief time i've been here
[23:10:27] <ButterNoodle> in the words of the great luke-jr... incest between siblings/cousins/etc is morally wrong, whereas parent/child incest is inherently wrong
[23:10:40] <ButterNoodle> naa
[23:10:42] <paine> the entirety of that time
[23:10:53] <ButterNoodle> just trin to dial in to the conversation 
[23:11:11] <ButterNoodle> my and my kid use to play FPS all the time
[23:11:24] <paine> oh we had a brief stint where we were really into animal crossing, that was fun
[23:11:24] <ButterNoodle> what an era.. first COD
[23:11:26] <Urchin[emacs]> paine: it's normally that way, but there's a difference between leaving things alone and stirring the can of worms
[23:11:52] <ButterNoodle> he got into it around quake3 timeframe
[23:12:05] <ButterNoodle> ofc I was a big gaymer
[23:12:10] <paine> i suck at q3
[23:12:20] <paine> but then i suck at fps so that's a given

[23:13:58] <ButterNoodle> Urchin[emacs]: I've played them all.. she still plays 3 and 4

[23:14:39] <ButterNoodle> lol yea my youngest loves all the harvest moon stuff
[23:14:50] <Urchin[emacs]> I've noticed that I play it differently than other people I've met, usually all my sims have most of the skills except few trained up to 5 or 6
[23:15:00] <paine> ya i've been playing those games since the 90s
[23:15:05] <ButterNoodle> now she just plays a bunch of shitty dinosaur games

[23:18:26] <paine> i like to point out to my son when i think he's being a little girl, i like to think it toughens him up
[23:18:34] <paine> because otherwise he'd be a complete sissy like his father
[23:19:33] <ButterNoodle> ... ik what u mean, but gendering behavior creates problems imho
[23:20:20] <paine> idk if calling him a baby is gendering him
[23:20:25] <paine> it sure gets him mad, tho
[23:20:27] <ButterNoodle> it is not
[23:20:33] <ButterNoodle> and appropriate
[23:20:40] <paine> tbh it amuses me
[23:20:50] <paine> probably one of the only joys in adult life is trolling my kid
[23:21:20] <paine> that and he's p cute sometimes 
[23:21:22] <ButterNoodle> in the word today, I'd prefer not to feed into any ideas of mis-gendering or whatever. kids are getting enough of that pressure from their peers. gone are the days of self discovery
[23:21:35] <paine> he's really confident in his own gender
[23:22:06] <paine> i always raised him with the ideas that girls and boys could and like whatever they wanted
[23:22:10] <ButterNoodle> my son was also.. based on the porn I seen in his browsing history
[23:22:15] <paine> or be whomever they wanted to be
[23:22:21] <paine> he's only ten
[23:22:25] <paine> he's still sweet and innocent okay
[23:22:28] <ButterNoodle> I just never had those conversations w mine
[23:22:30] <ButterNoodle> oh yea..
[23:22:37] <ButterNoodle> kids are great till they are teenagers
[23:22:46] <paine> i dread that day

[23:22:58] <ButterNoodle> both of mine were awesome till 13
[23:23:14] <paine> so many children
[23:23:38] <ButterNoodle> the son went from a top tier popular baseball player to wanting to be the outcast emo kid...
[23:23:58] <ButterNoodle> he committed social suicide by doing that
[23:24:14] <ButterNoodle> and had a hard time the rest of his school days
[23:25:07] <paine> poor kid knew not what he did
[23:25:25] <ButterNoodle> the old rule of dont finish first, dont finish last.. applies to everything
