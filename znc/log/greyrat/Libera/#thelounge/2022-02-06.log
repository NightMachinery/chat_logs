[00:26:39] <val> Hi, I have a bit of a weird request. npm and yarn have a bug preventing them from working on my system; is there a way to install The Lounge without root that does not depend on them?

[00:50:53] <bookworm> heh?
[00:51:11] <bookworm> bookworm is 12 and stable certainly has both working yarn and npm
[00:51:15] <val> the issue is that npm/yarn don't use getaddrinfo properly
[00:51:31] <bookworm> as in?
[00:51:31] <val> (or don't use it at all, I didn't investigate this far)
[00:51:44] <val> they only use the very first address returned by the resolver
[00:51:52] <val> which in my case is unroutable
[00:51:54] <bookworm> yes? That's how DNS works
[00:53:05] <bookworm> just point it at a local resolver that does whatever you need, systemd-resolved has a stub for that
[00:54:03] <val> hmm
[00:54:59] <Activ8> backup? format? update?
[00:55:04] <Activ8> change os?
[00:55:09] <bookworm> why do you even have a resolver configured that isn't routable?
[00:55:24] <val> I believe clients are supposed to try the next addresses when the first fails, though
[00:55:27] <val> eg. curl does it

[07:30:44] <thelounge130> Hi there, I am trying to move to HexChat to TheLounge which I have self hosted on my server. So I have some channels that I want to join and I want to save their connection settings so I dont need to copy/paste them every time I open up the tab. Can the Lounge do this? 
[07:33:56] <xnaas> thelounge130: you need to read config.js for The Lounge
[07:34:01] <xnaas> the comments are very detailed
[07:34:17] <xnaas> the very first setting is the one you'll care about most in this case
[07:34:20] <d76d5436757> are you running TL in private or public mode? If you need to add the channels every time you open TL, it looks like you're running it in public mode. Try switching to private mode first then add these channels. From the docs: "In private mode, The Lounge acts like a bouncer and a client combined, in order to offer an experience similar to other
[07:34:20] <d76d5436757> modern chat applications outside the IRC world. Users can then access and resume their session without being disconnected from their channels. In public mode, it acts as an open chat available to anyone without registration."
[07:35:25] <thelounge130> Ohhhhhh, I understand now. I am running in public mode which is my issue. Thanks for you help! o/
[07:38:45] <xnaas> While you're in config.js, I do definitely recommend reading the entire file. You'll learn a lot about what TL can do for you. :)

[10:57:21] <bookworm> xnaas: TL only requests playback if it doesn't already have messages from the message storage (sqlite)
[10:58:50] <bookworm> it will always enable the cap if the server advertises it, but that doesn't mean that it's actually using it

[11:03:12] <bookworm> literally, if you have sqlite enabled and it returns messages the playback cap will be ignored. If it doesn't, it'll try to fetch new messages
[11:03:37] <bookworm> so it depends if your client already had messages in the store or not
[11:06:57] <bookworm> (which seems a strange place to have the cap really... it also doesn't load scrollback if sqlite is disabled which makes no sense at all)
[11:08:34] <xnaas> What I'm reading from what you typed is that it doesn't request playback...?
[11:08:45] <xnaas> That doesn't sound right 😅
[11:09:26] <bookworm> if sqlite is enabled but returns exactly 0 messages and it has the cap then it does, else no
[11:09:48] <bookworm> don't shoot the messenger, I didn't write the code
[11:09:55] <xnaas> Well that seems...not useful, heh
[11:09:59] <bookworm> no
[11:10:18] <xnaas> I most definitely want the messages I missed.
[11:12:12] <bookworm> yes
[11:12:23] <bookworm> that's the point isn't it?
[11:12:37] * xnaas will have to open 1 or 2 issues later
[11:12:43] <bookworm> can ergo do it transparently to TL? then I'd do that
[11:12:55] <bookworm> znc has actually a better way than playback
[11:13:10] <xnaas> Only if I could disable the znc.in/playback CAP REQ
[11:13:20] <xnaas> Then ergo could do it a better way 
[11:13:31] <xnaas> but requesting the CAP overrides the other way
[11:13:31] <bookworm> called clientbuffer, that was what _Snuupy was trying to tell you
[11:13:55] <bookworm> ergo has CHATHISTORY, no?
[11:14:03] <bookworm> and that TL doesn't support yet
[11:14:08] * xnaas doesn't have or want ZNC involved in any way :P
[11:14:40] <xnaas> No, it's an auto replay thing that's entirely separate. I've seen it work fine in both weechat and hexchat. 
[11:15:03] <xnaas> And the only CAP weechat seems to REQ is SASL
[11:17:22] <xnaas> Regardless, I guess I'll open a couple of issues later when I wake up. Cat already has one of my arms. 🙃
[11:17:28] <bookworm> TL didn't make it an option as it usually doesn't get advertised by the server unless you have znc. Seems strange of ergo to use the vendored cap
[11:17:44] <bookworm> do that and say hi to your cat from me
[11:18:07] <xnaas> She sleepin' 😴
[11:20:01] <xnaas> I'm not qualified to give a definitive answer, but my understanding was that it's included because it is something that is functional and if thelounge was just saying "give me messages since X" on reconnect then it'd be working perfectly 😅
[11:23:35] <bookworm> well there are some edgecases if you also have a storage provider active but in theory yes
[11:24:32] <bookworm> you also need to store the last time you've seen a message so that you aren't requesting things from the beginning of time
[11:24:48] <bookworm> else you're gonna have a bad time, depending on your buffer size
[11:27:06] <xnaas> Also, I get why TL was only grabbing missed messages on a restart. It connected faster than it could get data from my massive SQLite logs 😅

[21:34:47] <Barracuda> I mean, I do have it when I create a network and it seems to work.
[21:37:01] <Andrew> Configuring it for locked public one-network-only doesn't work.
[21:37:14] <Andrew> Anyways, not a big deal, I lifted the network password restriction
[21:47:11] <Barracuda> guys, any plans to hide the Realname field, especially when lockNetwork is set to true? It's easier for management when other people might use TL to connect to our network too
[21:49:44] <Barracuda> I mean, I'd like for all the users on my network to have as realname something like Network Chat - https://sud.domain.tld, and that people weren't able to override it. I know I could probably build from source and hide those fields, but this is especially hard when installed via yarn/npm
[21:50:53] <Barracuda> just some food for thoughts, as I'm too stupid to even try to change it and submit a PR myself
[21:52:21] <xnaas> It's annoying, but, you could write some edits to the main theme and make that new theme the default. You could hide the field with just CSS.
[21:52:39] <xnaas> It's far from ideal, but it is a solution you could get now.
[21:54:07] <bookworm> realname is not a field you should be using for any  sort of auth, so I fail to see why this should be an option
[21:56:44] <xnaas> I see the value in that new-to-irc users don't understand what the field is there for or why and it just confuses them.
[21:57:14] <xnaas> Personally, I've not seen a soul change it from the default I have set for my server's public webchat 😅
[21:58:12] <bookworm> that may be, but it's still a user field. And in the case of "it's confusing" you can just hide it with CSS and the 1-2 people who are technical enough to still find it don't matter
[21:58:46] <xnaas> thus the CSS solution option I mentioned ;P
[21:58:47] <Barracuda> I don't know how to make themes or to use CSS that's not yet written, e.g
[21:59:09] <Barracuda> for me, 1+1=3

[22:07:33] <Barracuda> in my case is really inherent disability. example: you probably already know how to install TL from head.
