[06:39:27] <KarunM[m]> is it ok to partition my hardisk like this for dualbooting? the ones i indicated in red are the ones for my arch partition.. the others are for windows. i didn't want mess with the windows partition so i did this.
[07:01:11] <Arya[m]> wow thats a lot of partition
[07:15:09] <KarunM[m]> ya windows had crashed some time back, and I didn't have much to properly reinstall it, so it looks like this :/
[07:18:21] <Arya[m]> i am pretty sure you need some really bad repartitioning or just easier  reinstall
[07:29:05] <KarunM[m]> k I'll do that sometime
[08:50:25] <relejek[m]> <Arya[m]> "wow thats a lot of partition" <- This. 
[08:50:25] <relejek[m]> imo a good enough partition is boot, root(OS), and home. 
[08:50:25] <relejek[m]> If you're dual booting then you'll have 2 root partition as needed by each OS.
[08:52:19] <NeoVoid[m]> <KarunM[m]> "is it ok to partition my hardisk..." <- you dont need 512mb and 803 mb partition for linux just have that big 195 gb one. the linux installer will guide you to the partition for linux.
[08:52:56] <NeoVoid[m]> * the partition scheme for linux.
[08:56:57] <KarunM[m]> NeoVoid[m]: the video I was following said I needed those for swapfile and efi system partition I think
[08:57:27] <KarunM[m]> 23 gb one is for boot partition
[08:58:00] <KarunM[m]> 195 gb is for /home
[08:58:05] <PriyanshuRai[m]> KarunM[m]: Whott
[08:58:22] <PriyanshuRai[m]> Only 1 GB needed for boot
[08:58:54] <KarunM[m]> what is the name of the partition where all the program files are stored automatically when u use Pacman?
[09:00:21] <PriyanshuRai[m]> KarunM[m]: There is nothing separate. They are in the root directory either in etc or var or usr
[09:00:53] <KarunM[m]> oh ok sorry I think that's the root partition then

[09:09:23] <KarunM[m]> the problem is suppose i install windows first then the partition scheme will look like this. how do i use the remaining space for arch then? there doesn't seem to be any free space left..
[09:23:46] <NeoVoid[m]> <KarunM[m]> "the problem is suppose i install..." <- you need at least 20gb for root partition alone assuming you include home dir in it and not gonna use swap.
[09:23:46] <NeoVoid[m]> Use gparted in live linux to extend the partition
[09:24:14] <NeoVoid[m]> * the partition or windows disk manager if you prefer that
[09:32:40] <KarunM[m]> ok I'll try that
[09:37:44] <relejek[m]> Karun M:  use swap files instead of swap partition. 
[09:37:44] <relejek[m]> Don't new installers  do that already?

[11:06:15] <pystardust> KarunM[m]: http://0x0.st/-Fqb.txt my disk also messedup , but works good
[11:21:49] <pypy> pystardust:  were u triple booting ? Thats a lot of partitions
[11:28:45] <pystardust> Yeah, i was quad booting at a point
