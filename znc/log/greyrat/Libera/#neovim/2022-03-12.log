[00:00:46] <dundargoc> > <@britcod:matrix.org> recently i am trying to utilize neovim's diagnostic api, but i found some essential plugin were no licensed. how do you deal with that situation?... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/da3a9f87ac0851e98c012c72a94067317757a293)
[00:01:02] <dundargoc> I assume no license text means no license.
[00:01:08] <dundargoc> (not a lawyer btw)
[00:01:26] <xiretza[m]> dundargoc: it means "all rights reserved"
[00:01:41] <xiretza[m]> any and all rights have to be granted explicitly
[00:01:53] <britcod[m]> "essential" for me, i migrated from ale.
[00:02:12] <dundargoc> I don't know what a "right" is.
[00:02:32] <xiretza[m]> dundargoc: the right to use it. the right to copy it. the right to modify it. etc
[00:02:44] <britcod[m]> i actually forked trouble.nvim, and made some changes
[00:02:59] <dundargoc> I mean it's folke, he's cool
[00:03:28] <dundargoc> Use that in your trial.
[00:03:28] <dundargoc> "But your honor, they said folke was *cool*"
[00:03:38] <xiretza[m]> sure, I don't think anyone's going to get sued here, but technically you aren't allowed to do anything with it if the copyright holder hasn't allowed it

[00:04:19] <dundargoc> xiretza[m]: Sounds like entrapment or something
[00:04:53] <xiretza[m]> dundargoc: what? it's just basic copyright, you can't just take whatever you find online and do whatever you want with it

[00:05:06] <dundargoc> hehehe
[00:05:12] <dundargoc> ok

[00:06:21] <dundargoc> folke: Imma do whatever I want with your code and there's nothing you can do to stop me.
[00:06:56] <dundargoc> (please don't sue me tho)
[00:08:26] <folke[m]> Go for it, I'm not stopping anyone ðŸ˜‰
[00:09:05] <folke[m]> But I'll add the license just to be sure ðŸ˜…
[00:10:58] <mjlbach[m]> Just to clarify, while trouble is great, you can also send lsp diagnostics directly to the qflist built-in to neovim
[00:11:04] <sunjonSenghanBri> if the topic is hypothetical pedantry; without a license from the beginning, everyone that had PR's merged also became a copyright holder
[00:11:56] <dundargoc> sunjonSenghanBri: I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux.
[00:12:30] <dundargoc> Damn, that was a quick thumbs down :(
[00:12:59] <britcod[m]> <folke[m]> "Sorry guys, been a bit busy with..." <- that's great, thank you! (i looked the repo's issues/prs, it seems the repo has no activity for a while, so i asked here in case others may use it too)
[00:13:16] <clason[m]> What happens in chat, stays in chat
[00:13:38] <clason[m]> Just like Sagittarius A*
[00:16:14] <dundargoc> britcod: which licenses are you OK with and which are you not OK with?
[00:18:19] <dundargoc> Neovim and lspconfig uses apache 2, which is a relatively off-hands license.
[00:19:28] <dundargoc> So assuming apache 2 is fine with you then any apache 2 plugin should be fine.
[00:20:42] <dundargoc> Oh wait, neovim is a mix license (mix between apache 2 and vim's own) and lspconfig is apache 2 only.
[00:21:04] <dundargoc> Make sure your company is fine with vim's license as it isn't a standard license as far as I'm aware.
[00:21:38] <folke[m]> I typically use Apache 2 or MIT for older stuff 
[00:22:00] <p00f> dundargoc: isn't it do whatever you want but send me patches
[00:22:45] <dundargoc> I don't know, I don't read licenses

[01:19:05] *** britcod[m] is now known as haoliang[m]
[01:20:35] <dundargoc> Kinda surprised tbh, feel like there should be a "warning_name" in the lsp protocol or something.
[01:20:51] <dundargoc> * Kinda surprised if not tbh, feel
[01:25:15] <dundargoc> OK, I assume it's not possible. Shall I open a feature request then? Would this be under neovim or lspconfig?
[01:32:25] <mjlbach[m]> Neither
[01:33:32] <bfredl> <dundargoc> "Anyone here know how to silence..." <- clangd just uses the same warnings as your compiler. so configure the warnings in the cflags in the build file
[01:33:38] <puremourning> -Wno-<warning>
[01:33:57] <puremourning> or upgrade to YCM which has error filters, obviously :D
[01:34:12] <dundargoc> mjlbach[m]: Very helpful, as always
[01:34:55] <bfredl> it is correct tho. you should try to configure clangd first :]

[11:48:14] <f3fora[m]> is it possible to set up Inverse Search with TexLab, nvim-lspconfig and Zathura?
[11:48:14] <f3fora[m]> Forward Search is well documented, but Inverse Search is described only for VScode.

[11:48:19] <mjlbach[m]> puremourning: yeah 100% agree
[11:49:00] <mjlbach[m]> We try to expose the requisite functions users can override instead to allow more granular control, and only add configuration flags if it is something that a very large fraction of users are doing

[11:58:56] <puremourning> I donâ€™t want to write code to make your plugin work. Just add the spacebar heating option ffs.
[12:00:21] <puremourning> And other versions of the same. I admit that I prefer not to provide a programming env/api because they are harder to maintain over time. Options at least have defined semantics which means implementations can change. Apis are the hardest thing to design.
[12:01:13] <puremourning> Though I have done the same in vimspector rather than add options. So i guess itâ€™s a trade off. Arbitrary api is less work on our side for more flexibility with the cost of difficult compatibility story

[14:18:10] <clason[m]> hmm, attribution got lost in forwarding. that snippet was from asn last year.
[14:18:56] <clason[m]> no need to wrap it in a module; just make it a local function and put this into the `callback` for `:h nvim_create_autocmd()`

[14:18:56] <nvim-bot[m]> * `nvim_create_autocmd()`
[14:19:06] <clason[m]> (on master only)
[14:20:51] <clason[m]> as you can see, there's not much benefit from a Lua version since it's just accessing Vim functions and commands; I'd just wrap the `autocmd` into a `vim.cmd` and call it a day.
[14:21:03] <clason[m]> s/into/in/
[14:23:29] <willcl_ark> I see, thanks. I struggled to wrap it though as a command, as there are so many `"` chars in the pattern...
[14:24:02] <clason[m]> `vim.cmd [[ ... ]]` should work, though (even for a multiline Vimscript block)?
[14:24:58] <willcl_ark> ohh, can I use those inside `vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd`'s
[14:25:41] <clason[m]> sure, but why?

[14:27:43] <clason[m]> yes, `[[...]]` works just as well as `"..."` and `'...'`

[14:28:23] <clason[m]> but that is wrong (you're mixing up `pattern` and `command`)
[14:28:38] <willcl_ark> should it all go in command?
[14:29:12] <clason[m]> the whole `if` thing is a command that gets executed for a `<buffer>` autocommand (which is set by a `BufEnter` autocommand with pattern  `*`)
[14:29:33] <willcl_ark> ðŸ‘Œ
[14:30:53] <willcl_ark> working: `autocmd({ "BufRead" }, { command = vim.cmd[[if expand('%:p') !~# '\m/\.git' && line("'\"") > 1 && line("'\"") <= line("$") | exe "normal! g'\"" | endif ]], group = general, pattern = "*" , once = true })`
[14:30:53] <willcl_ark> muchas gracias. at least looks a bit tidier and matches my others
[14:31:39] <theh> I want to display in the statusline whether Tree-Sitter (highlighting) is active in the current buffer. I looked at the utility functions and went with `require("nvim-treesitter.parsers").has_parser()`. Is that a good approach, or is there something more robust / obvious for my use case?

[14:34:18] <clason[m]> > muchas gracias. at least looks a bit tidier and matches my others
[14:34:18] <clason[m]> I don't think that works -- the `command` expects a vimscript string, so just drop the `vim.cmd`
[14:35:29] <willcl_ark> seems to work both ways for me
[14:35:36] <willcl_ark> ill drop it anyway
[14:35:44] <clason[m]> it really shouldn't
[14:36:18] <clason[m]> (if `autocmd` == `vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd`)
[14:36:56] <willcl_ark> it does indeed == that
[14:39:30] <theh> willcl_ark[m]: Yup, just `command = [[if ... endif]], â€¦`
[14:39:53] <willcl_ark> thanks guys, seems to be working now in whatever way :P
[14:40:00] <theh> Btw, what does the `.git` part do? I only have the latter part (once copied from the help files)
[14:41:32] <clason[m]> presumably it's a replacement for the `filetype=gitcommit` check in the version from the manual?
[14:41:34] <theh> Hmm, in the help file it now starts with `if &ft !~# 'commit\|rebase' â€¦`, maybe I should update mine.
[14:44:33] <theh> I had another question regarding Lua. I have a few utility functions that feed the status line. They return a string or nothing. Do I use `return ""` or just `return` in the case where they return nothing? Habitually I would assume the type has to match (i.e. empty string), but maybe Lua is different.
[14:45:08] <willcl_ark> Ah yes, I meant to update to the new from the help too, but accidentally re-used my old!
[14:45:51] <clason[m]> theh: Lua is not typed
[14:46:12] <clason[m]> and `"" != nil`
[14:46:42] <clason[m]> but, depending on the statusline, probably have the same effect in this case
[14:46:48] <theh> Yeah, I'm used to typed languages. Both seem to work (lualine probably handles it), but better `""` then I guess?
[14:48:42] <theh> Eh I'll just leave them at `return ""`, seems predictable.
[14:50:58] <clason[m]> Sure, that works.

[21:09:10] <bfredl> it is just for pacman installed plugins. no such plugins, no problemos.
[21:09:33] <nova> It may have been pacman -S fzf idk
[21:09:43] <nova> but I don't use pacman for nvim plugins. ew
[21:10:04] <bfredl> fzf is not fzf-vim (hopefully also in arch..)
[21:10:15] <bfredl> YIKES
[21:10:21] <nova> ohh. maybe if I just uninstall vim ... because this is the same config dir that vim uses
[21:11:02] <nova> but I kinda want vim ... for testing vim-9-script >_> ... welp I guess I will be modifying the pkgbuild for vim after checking to see if it provides some stupid archlinux config stuff
[21:11:25] <clason[m]> bfredl: fun fact: fzf _does_ bundle a vim plugin so you can use fzf from vim. what fzf-vim does is add _another_ plugin so you can access vim from fzf
[21:11:34] <clason[m]> but I thought it only messed with Vim, not Nvim.
[21:11:57] <nova> clason[m], the vim package (I think) is what creates the /etx/xdg/sysinit.vim - pretty sure
[21:12:03] <clason[m]> nova: yeah, don't do that. that's considered harmful these days
[21:12:03] <bfredl> clason[m]: yes, but I hope that the repo package _still_ would reflect the distinction. but I don't use fzf so I wouldn't know :P
[21:12:20] <nova> but neovim is picking up on $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS which is /etc/xdg and then it sees that there is a sysinit.vim in there, so it runs it
[21:12:32] <clason[m]> I use brew and could deter them from making a similar egregious mistake ;)

[21:13:19] <clason[m]> hmm. 
[21:13:28] <clason[m]> we should stop doing that then
[21:13:28] <bfredl> I don't use pacman for neovim at all. neovim master is the only true version. and the bundled build is the only trve build of that.
[21:13:53] <clason[m]> sharing config with vim
[21:14:13] <bfredl> that's arch's original sin, unfortunately.
[21:14:14] <nova> it's an older component ported directly from vim and not looked at much because it doesn't break anything.
[21:14:21] <bfredl> we would need to drop them some hitns..
[21:14:27] <bfredl> s/hitns/hints/
[21:15:05] <nova> it's not a high priority thing or anything. I just don't need it and would prefer it to go bye bye for that extra 40ms of startup back :P
[21:15:15] <bfredl> arch considers both neovim and vim to be implementation of "vim plugin runtime" as a concept. so to install any arch packaged plugin you need either.
[21:15:29] <clason[m]> nova: but Vim's config files are named differently (even system)
[21:16:08] <nova> daaang I think you're right. I have /usr/share stuff but no /etc/xdg
[21:16:11] <p00f> bfredl: it does
[21:16:16] <bfredl> sure, but arch adds a startup file for nvim with the line `set runtimepath+=/usr/share/vim/vimfiles`
[21:16:35] <nova> I installed aur/neovim-nightly-bin
[21:16:36] <bfredl> that's the sin I was talking about

[21:17:09] <nova> why is it evil? I don't wanna wait 10 minutes for compile ;_;
[21:17:13] <jaawerth[m]> but you don't have to merge it
[21:17:23] <mjlbach[m]> it's like 1 minute

[21:18:23] <bfredl> `/etc/xdg/nvim/sysinit.vim` must go babye
[21:18:34] <jaawerth[m]> anyway, it doesn't bother me at all - if I were going to install a vim plugin via pacman, I would do so for both. and the only ones I get automatically are more or less just syntax plugins that come with things. for my use it's fine, but I can see how it could be an nasty surprise depending on what you install that way
[21:18:46] <bfredl> nova: true, replace it with empty file
[21:18:49] <bfredl> as a place holder
[21:19:02] <jaawerth[m]> just comment out the offending line, it's easy
[21:19:03] <bfredl> then you just getta pacnew
[21:19:09] <nova> I can't remember if pacman will hash the file and compare for changes. Well, I can always try
[21:19:13] <ii14[m]> add rm /etc/xdg/nvim/sysinit.vim to cron lol
[21:19:32] <jaawerth[m]> updating the packages will result in a `.pacnew` file for it, which you can just ignore (or I think there's a way to say "don't care!" but the pacnew doesn't hurt anything)
[21:19:47] <bfredl> nova: not sure if it uses a fancy hash but it does a diff for config files. so those won't get overwritten

[22:35:12] <ebray187> thanks nova!
[22:35:46] <nova> ah and here I thought sts controlled it. I always set shiftwidth to 0 so it mirrors either sts or ts

[22:45:18] <haoliang[m]> how can i handle errors caused by vim.fn.* in lua?
[22:45:18] <haoliang[m]> for example, `vim.fn.mkdir("/path/cant/be/created")`

[23:10:44] <nova> haoliang[m], pcall
[23:10:56] <nova> maybe

[23:13:24] <nova> yeah. thankfully it works well
[23:15:16] <haoliang[m]> thanks for the link and "pcall" keyword, i made it!... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/d7ab30a8c77a5d4b8e76afe1148dc5a0e38659b9)
[23:16:47] <p00f> vim.api.nvim_err_writeln
[23:17:39] <haoliang[m]> btw, it is a pity that vim.split does not have a "maxsplit" parameter
[23:18:09] <gpanders> You can do it yourself with vim.gsplit
[23:18:17] <gpanders> vim.split is really just a thin wrapper around that anyway
[23:20:54] <haoliang[m]> thanks to you all!

[23:22:28] <nova> is there something in help that links nvim_*( functions to each vim command?
[23:34:00] <haoliang[m]> maybe it's not really needed, i could have read `:h api` twice before ask (such a shame)
[23:34:01] <nvim-bot[m]> * [`api`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/api.html#api) in *api.txt*
