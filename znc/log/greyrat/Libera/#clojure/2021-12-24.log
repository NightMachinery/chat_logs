[08:01:06] <TimMc> I've been away a while and I'm trying to upgrade a library to be Clojure 1.10 compatible. It's screwing with my (is (thrown-with-msg? ...)) check in a test, which now has a CompilerException wrapped around the expected exception. Is there a standard approach here?
[08:02:00] <TimMc> (If needed, I'll do something awful like write a macro that catches and strips off the compiler exception... but I'm hoping there's a better answer.)
[08:05:09] *** Quits: genieliu (~genieliu@103.37.140.24) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[08:16:03] <atw> You could change it to (let [thrown (is (thrown? ...))] (is (= ... (-> thrown .getCause .getMessage))))
[08:17:45] <atw> because (is (thrown? ...)) evaluates to the exception that is thrown, allowing you to make assertions about the thrown thing. I am a little curious though about why it's necessary to test something that throws a CompilerException (or at least, something that throws a CompilerException in 1.10)
[08:19:10] <technomancy> isn't there a root-cause function or something?
[08:21:03] <atw> true, ex-cause. I had to check that it works on stuff besides ex-info, and it does
[08:21:14] <atw> ,(ex-cause (RuntimeException. "outer" (RuntimeException. "inner")))
[08:22:03] <TimMc> I have some macro and I wanted to check that it has a nice error message for a certain type of syntax error.
[08:22:04] <atw> rip clojurebot
[08:22:33] <technomancy> I really don't like thrown? and thrown-with-msg? tbh
[08:22:58] <technomancy> the way they're done as special forms of `is` instead of as real macros =\
[08:23:02] <technomancy> and the indentation
[08:23:06] <TimMc> The code in question: https://github.com/timmc/handy/blob/d8d71a7/test/org/timmc/t_handy.clj#L69
[08:23:07] <jeaye> atw: didn't make it over to libera
[08:23:33] <atw> technomancy, I don't love a lot of clojure.test either *shrug*
[08:23:36] <TimMc> (Apparently I haven't touched this code in 5 years.)
[08:24:12] <technomancy> atw: most of the badness can be avoided with a better runner, but not that
[08:24:42] <atw> fixtures though
[08:25:15] * technomancy sighs
[08:27:13] <atw> TimMc: I'm not sure if a macro should expand to invalid code which then fails to compile, or whether the macro should check for the error itself. Not sure what I would do there (I don't write many macros)

[08:41:30] <TimMc> It's actually that the macro throws rather than returning. Imagine a precondition on the defmacro. (Not sure if that's actually a thing.)
[08:41:51] <TimMc> If a defmacro throws, I guess that gets wrapped in compiler exception.
[08:44:33] <TimMc> Probably I'm supposed to do something with spec instead.

[20:42:03] <neirac> how do I create a RFC3339 format time?, I tried java-time (local-date-time) but seems is not valid
[20:45:42] <neirac> oh, I just missed "Z" on the string

[23:00:23] <TimMc> jeaye: Huh, I guess I've just always written it that way. Maybe because my editor wraps it that way?
[23:03:05] <ridcully> neirac: if you want zulu, your best bet is an instant.  i'd argue, that on the server your best bet is always an instant
[23:06:04] <TimMc> I see, doc sticks "  " onto the :doc string and assumes the remaining lines are also indented by two.  Fascinating.
[23:06:09] <TimMc> Well, I can fix that.

[23:18:18] <TimMc> I'm still waiting for the language that unifies the support for code-reasoning that you get with return option/enum types and the ease of use of unchecked exceptions. Maybe that will never happen.

[23:23:37] <selfsymmetric-mu> TimMc: Watch out for flow-sensitive typing in the future. It's not a panacea, but it's got a pretty intuitive feel for those two things.
