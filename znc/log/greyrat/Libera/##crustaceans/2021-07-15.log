[07:12:08] <quanticle> Hmm... I was wondering if it'd be feasible to replace the simple count with a tuple: (read time, words), for those of us who find a word count to be more informative than a read time.

[12:11:27] <bkero> cyberpunk is "grim meathook future"?
[12:12:23] <gustaf> it can be
[12:12:33] <gustaf> would you like to live in the Sprawl?
[12:13:18] <bkero> It only looks that way if you're on the top already.
[12:13:37] <bkero> I'm sure the Sprawl has many more amenities and better quality of life than most of the world has enjoyed throughout history.
[12:23:31] <quanticle> "When it gets down to it -- talking trade balances here -- once we've brain-drained all our technology into other countries, once things have evened out, they're making cars in Bolivia and microwave ovens in Tadzhikistan and selling them here -- once our edge in natural resources has been made irrelevant by giant Hong Kong ships and dirigibles that can ship North Dakota all the way to New

[12:34:48] <quanticle> Yeah, when gustaf said, "It only looks that way when you're on the top already," that was the first thing that popped into mind
[12:35:13] <quanticle> For, say, an poor Afghan poppy farmer even "grim meathook future" cyberpunk is actually something of a paradise
[12:35:22] <quanticle> Or at least, a *marked* improvement in living standards
[12:35:35] <gustaf> bkero: have you read John Shirley's trilogy A Song Called Youth ?
[12:36:32] <gustaf> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_Trilogy
[12:36:32] <buttsbot> Eclipse Trilogy - Wikipedia
[12:38:36] <bkero> I haven't.
[12:40:41] <bkero> I've read a lot of Dick, Zelazny, Philip Jose Farmer, Gibson, Stephenson, and Vernor Vinge
[12:41:20] <bkero> I'm sure you can find trappings of dystopia inside cyberpunk settings since it was more a set of ideas than a codified single universe.
[12:41:37] <quanticle> re: calcification into empty tropes, that happens to every science fiction genre. I read some space opera from the late '60s and it was the same way
[12:41:45] <bkero> What I'm specifically referring to is the portrayal by Gibson.
[12:42:16] <bkero> Specifically in Neuromancer and the Sprawl trilogy
[12:42:31] <quanticle> What's interesting is that Gibson and Stephenson basically bookended cyberpunk
[12:42:41] *** Quits: leon (~leon@user/leon) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[12:42:46] <quanticle> Gibson kicks it off with Burning Chrome and Johnny Mnemonic
[12:43:05] <quanticle> And Stephenson finishes it with Snow Crash, Diamond Age and Cryptonomicon
[12:43:40] <bkero> Calling Diamond Age cyberpunk would be a bit of a stretch, but some of the trappings are there.
[12:43:56] *** Joins: leon (~leon@user/leon)
[12:43:56] <bkero> (but that's just my perspective)
[12:44:22] <quanticle> I agree; I think Diamond Age was an offshoot of cyberpunk
[12:44:28] <quanticle> Of the genre but not in the genre
[12:44:54] <quanticle> Post-cyberpunk?
[12:45:02] <bkero> Diamond Age might be solarpunk if solarpunk had more of a definition.
[12:46:11] <quanticle> My take on Diamond Age is that Diamond Age is what cyberpunk would have been if we'd kept going with steampunk technology.
[12:46:19] <quanticle> Instead of going digital
[12:46:21] <bkero> After steampunk reached post-scarcity
[12:46:25] <quanticle> Yeah
[12:46:35] <bkero> It's neo-Victorian
[12:46:39] <bkero> which steampunk also is
[12:46:42] <quanticle> I don't think Diamond Age was post-scarcity, though
[12:46:52] <quanticle> I do recall the main character having resource limits
[12:47:24] <bkero> They're post-scarcity for basic things
[12:47:42] <bkero> But you're right, not everybody has the Young Lady's Illustrated Primer with *actual* actresses reading the book aloud.
[12:48:07] <quanticle> I guess? There is that scene where the main character has to worry about whether they have enough of a matter budget to 3-d print a mattress to sleep on
[12:48:23] <quanticle> I vaguely remember htat
[12:48:25] <quanticle> *that
[12:48:31] <bkero> Weren't they also border-line illegal as well?
[12:48:41] <quanticle> (But it's been a long time since I read Diamond Age, so I might be misremembering)
[12:48:43] <bkero> Something Hong Kong something
[12:51:16] <quanticle> Anyway, going back to what I was saying earlier re: "calcified tropes", if you want to see calcified tropes in action, read _Nova_, by Samuel R. Delaney. Now, this isn't to say that Nova is a bad book. Far from it. Nova is very competently executed, and it's written by a very well known author.
[12:51:28] <quanticle> But there's just nothing *new* there
[12:52:05] <quanticle> It recycles a bunch of space opera tropes that would have been fresh if Isaac Asimov had written them in the '50s.
[12:52:19] <quanticle> But by 1968, they were worn and cliche
[12:53:28] <gustaf> Diamon Age is a dystopia
[12:54:01] <gustaf> or rather, it's our world extrapolated
[12:54:27] <quanticle> Not really? It's the Victorian Era extrapolated into the far future
[12:54:30] <quanticle> Not our world
[12:55:42] <quanticle> The Diamond Age is a world in which the world wars either never happen or have a very muted impact, because the states seem to be successors to Victorian/Edwardian colonial empires, not modern post-war nation-states
[12:57:32] <quanticle> Oh wow, TIL Delaney is still alive
[12:57:50] <quanticle> He wrote Nova when he 25
[12:58:35] <gustaf> quanticle: there's a character in Diamond Age from Snow Crash...
[12:58:40] <gustaf> so it's the same universe
[12:58:56] <gustaf> I loved Delaney's memoirs
[12:59:51] <quanticle> Yeah, there is... but I don't know, thematically it feels so different
[13:00:00] <quanticle> I know it's supposed to be a sequel
[13:00:26] <quanticle> But I can't really trace a path from the ending of Snow Crash to the beginning of the Diamond Age
[13:01:11] <quanticle> Unless you want to tell me that the world suddenly rediscovering old-style colonial imperialism is plausible.
[13:02:50] <gustaf> it's not steampunk, it's nanotech
[13:03:12] <gustaf> and the neo-Victorian aspect is how society adapts to the changes
[13:03:30] <gustaf> instead of nations you have clades with shared social values
[13:04:44] <quanticle> Yeah, it's nanotech... but it's nanotech steampunk!
[13:05:01] <gustaf> I read a steampunk novel once
[13:05:05] <gustaf> it sucked ;)
[13:05:21] <quanticle> Because the "rod logic" in Diamond Age has way more to do with Babbage's Analytical Engine than it does with modern digital circuits
[13:06:25] <gustaf> well it's Stephenson's way to implement digital computers in nanotech
[13:06:40] <gustaf> there's an entire book within a book discussing turing machines
[13:06:49] <quanticle> So that's what I mean by, "It doesn't feel like Diamond Age takes place in the same world as Snow Crash," because Snow Crash takes place in our world (or at least a world very similar to ours). It's a world where we looked at the Analytical Engine, decided it was a dead end, and moved on to digital circuits.
[13:07:43] <quanticle> And now you mean to tell me that somehow people looked at this dead-end technology, miles behind even the most primitive relay-based digital logic and went, "Actually, if you implement it in nanotech..."
[13:11:30] <gustaf> I mean Snow Crash is supposed to be like 20 minutes in the future
[13:11:51] <gustaf> the Hiro Protagonist has a dad who survived the blast in Hiroshima
[13:12:23] <gustaf> so there's a lot of handwving
