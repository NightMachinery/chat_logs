[11:30:24] <DunceCotus> sublim20: where?
[11:30:30] <sublim20> uhhh
[11:30:35] <sublim20> i thought you knew
[11:30:36] <DunceCotus> second rave hath begun
[11:30:40] <sublim20> lets go
[11:30:53] <DunceCotus> party on!
[11:31:18] <DunceCotus> sublim20: like.. I guess there are "rave" clubs these days
[11:31:25] <sublim20> heh
[11:31:28] <sublim20> i have no idea
[11:31:32] <DunceCotus> its all very commercialised and unbearable though
[11:31:32] <sublim20> i was never into that scene
[11:31:50] <sublim20> yeah, isn't the big draw of that scene, the whole 'undergroundness'
[11:32:01] <sublim20> as in, 'come to this abandoned building at 2am'
[11:32:18] <DunceCotus> sublim20: neither was I, but I was 'only a kid' at that time, not even teenager, but I found the aesthetic to be a bit nasty spirited
[11:32:26] <DunceCotus> though at the same time the music could get sublime
[11:32:32] <sublim20> nasty how
[11:32:34] <sublim20> ?
[11:32:48] <DunceCotus> like thuggish
[11:32:56] <DunceCotus> propensity for violence
[11:33:02] <sublim20> probably the drug dealing
[11:33:12] <sublim20> drug dealing at those places has gotta be a gold mine
[11:33:14] <DunceCotus> it was a lot more benevolent in the rave circles I tihnk than other scenes around that time
[11:33:17] <DunceCotus> but still
[11:33:18] <sublim20> so there's probably a lot of competition
[11:33:45] <sublim20> underground punk shows were like that
[11:34:00] <DunceCotus> yeah like I think the spirit was right
[11:34:06] <sublim20> not too thuggish, but definitely the kind of thing a woman shouldn't go alone
[11:34:07] <DunceCotus> or rather radical, exciting
[11:34:35] * sublim20 slips a drug into DunceCotus' drink
[11:34:40] <DunceCotus> but it was too married to the ghetto-ification of the burbs and the growing angry hip-hop sound that came out of that
[11:34:41] <sublim20> whoopsie!
[11:35:10] <DunceCotus> now we have cynical, 'suave' hip-pop
[11:35:18] <DunceCotus> and its been excruciating
[11:35:44] <DunceCotus> but hey I realise a lot of people like this stuff
[11:36:00] <DunceCotus> I just think it has 0 positive or radical potential
[11:36:25] <sublim20> possibly
[11:36:28] <sublim20> no idea here
[11:36:32] <sublim20> i just go to stoner rock shows
[11:36:41] <sublim20> and that crowd has been, and continues to be, ultra chill
[11:36:48] <DunceCotus> sublim20: everyone's in their own bubble these days
[11:37:01] <DunceCotus> the music we all hear is often really terrible pop
[11:37:22] <DunceCotus> so there's no sense of a 'generation' of music
[11:37:32] <sublim20> yeah, well 
[11:37:38] <sublim20> the radio isn't as popular anymore
[11:37:45] <louipc> stone age rocks?
[11:37:50] <DunceCotus> its all just a mass of some nuggets of good here and there and just a sea of over-produced 'crowd-pleasing' hip-pop sheeit
[11:38:03] <sublim20> which is good, cause, at least here in the states, the radios have basically all been bought out by one company
[11:38:21] <DunceCotus> radio gaga
[11:38:24] <sublim20> here's a song about that
[11:38:26] *** Joins: audiobirb (~audio@user/audio)
[11:38:33] <DunceCotus> I grew up with radio and it was fine
[11:38:40] <DunceCotus> mostly classic hits radio tho

[11:38:45] <Janet> ^ Korn - 'Y'all Want A Single' (Official Video Uncensored) - YouTube
[11:38:53] <DunceCotus> there were a lot of ads even back then, but they at least were sometimes amusing
[11:39:05] <DunceCotus> then the 2000s rolled around and jesus f chrust
[11:39:14] <louipc> yea they had jingles
[11:39:28] <sublim20> oh god, 
[11:39:29] <sublim20> the jingles
[11:39:30] <sublim20> NO
[11:39:39] <DunceCotus> ads became rapid-fire, almost subliminal, you got maybe 30 seconds of music between each ad-block
[11:39:39] <louipc> yes the jingles are the best
[11:39:47] <sublim20> 1877 KARS 4 KIDS.   K-A-R-S KARS 4 KIDS
[11:39:52] <louipc> bada bap bap bap im lovin it
[11:40:04] * sublim20 murders louipc 
[11:40:11] <DunceCotus> and the music variety was heavily reduced
[11:40:21] <sublim20> check out the ownership
[11:40:28] <sublim20> cause that happened here in the u.s.
[11:40:29] <louipc> juicy fruit its gonna gonna gonna move ya
[11:40:40] <DunceCotus> so if you were listening to classic hits radio it would be like the same 10 or so 'classics' (generally the most popular rock and roll hits or something)
[11:40:43] <sublim20> as clear channel bought out EVERYTHING
[11:41:00] <DunceCotus> 2001 I think put us in a sort of time loop
[11:41:13] <sublim20> when was cern turned on
[11:41:13] <DunceCotus> which we're still slowing trying to unscrew from
[11:41:17] <sublim20> ?
[11:41:42] <DunceCotus> sublim20: 2008 first tests I think
[11:41:43] <louipc> pirate radio is the only way
[11:41:43] <louipc> or internet i guess
[11:41:49] <DunceCotus> then 2010-2012
[11:41:56] * sublim20 imagines some low level employee at cern, eating a sandwich on his lunch break, knocking a wrench down into cern and going 'whats the worse that can happen'
[11:42:00] <DunceCotus> it was full power in 2012, they discovered Higgsly
[11:42:22] <sublim20> pirate radio needs to come back
[11:42:27] <DunceCotus> sorry March 2013
[11:42:35] <sublim20> lets all pitch in and get ourselves a boat
[11:42:39] <DunceCotus> it was at that time I felt my anatomy change
[11:43:00] <DunceCotus> lots of very weird happenings since then
[11:43:24] <DunceCotus> like novelty has increased but there's still a lot of artificial limiters in place
[11:44:02] <DunceCotus> sublim20: yeah
[11:44:08] <louipc> drone radio
[11:44:34] <sublim20> the weight of the equipment would probably necessitate a boat
[11:44:37] <louipc> why get a boat
[11:44:50] <sublim20> the antenna alone would probably rule out a drone
[11:45:02] <louipc> what if it was a car drone
[11:45:03] <DunceCotus> sublim20: well I think they're not just doing quantum experiments but they're perhaps unconsciously (or consciously) tapping into some kind of quantum matrix of possible variations, parallel 'universes'
[11:45:37] <sublim20> as long as they dont hire a 'gordon freeman' we should be fine
[11:45:54] <DunceCotus> this is a substratum of quantum fields which is like the compiler of reality
[11:46:01] <DunceCotus> it can be reconfigured to produced variations of reality
[11:46:05] <DunceCotus> perhaps self-configures
[11:46:15] <louipc> what the hell yall takin bout
[11:46:17] <sublim20> whats your background DunceCotus 
[11:46:38] <sublim20> dude could be a quantum physicist for all we know
[11:46:41] <DunceCotus> sublim20: multimedia, visual art
[11:46:44] <sublim20> or a cali stoner
[11:46:45] <DunceCotus> sublim20: some programming
[11:46:50] <sublim20> cali stoner it is then
[11:46:51] <sublim20> :p
[11:47:04] <DunceCotus> I'm not in cali
[11:47:06] <DunceCotus> but I am stoner
[11:47:18] <sublim20> just assumed you were because of the time
[11:47:48] <DunceCotus> sublim20: its very strange realising you now live in a slight variation of the former world
[11:48:12] <DunceCotus> sometimes not so slight but perhaps we shed worlds like onionskin or pages of book
[11:48:59] <sublim20> i could see that
[11:49:05] <sublim20> but, i dont think we'll ever truly know
[11:49:20] <DunceCotus> when it happens, you know
[11:49:26] <DunceCotus> but you can forget it
[11:49:30] <DunceCotus> or get used to it
[11:49:41] <DunceCotus> its just kinda obvious, I dunno, at least to me
[11:50:06] <DunceCotus> its like, easier on the psyche to chalk it up as false memory.. but may not necessarily be the truth
[11:51:35] <sublim20> ok mr DunceCotus 
[11:51:41] <sublim20> the nice men are here to take you away now

[11:53:25] <DunceCotus> jizzed plying
[11:54:35] <DunceCotus> sublim20: the very aesthetic of reality, and affect of 'scale' and 'viscosity' of the space, these things can change
[11:55:17] <DunceCotus> and when they change it is though moving into a parallel universe which developed differently, or does not have direct relation to the former universe's affective causation
[11:56:17] <DunceCotus> sublim20: sorry, i'm high is all
[11:57:42] <sublim20> no worries man
[11:57:48] <sublim20> the only issue is, why aren't you sharing
[11:57:50] <sublim20> sharing is caring
[11:57:58] <sublim20> *rainbow appears*
[11:58:30] <DunceCotus> I am over-sharing
[11:58:38] <sublim20> whats the price of weed where you're at DunceCotus 
[11:58:40] <DunceCotus> over-coding flows perhaps.. but its strange MAN
[11:58:44] <sublim20> like, whats the average for an 1/8th
[11:58:59] <DunceCotus> sublim20: too much
[11:59:05] <sublim20> im picking up what you're putting down man
[11:59:12] <DunceCotus> sublim20: probably like $35
[11:59:16] <sublim20> wtf
[11:59:19] <sublim20> that's cheap
[11:59:25] <sublim20> ny is like 50
[11:59:35] <DunceCotus> sorry I miscalculated
[11:59:38] <DunceCotus> $70 AUD
[11:59:50] <sublim20> you're an aussie?
[11:59:51] <DunceCotus> and with out cost of living that's a lot
[11:59:53] <DunceCotus> yeah
[12:00:05] <sublim20> yeah, everything price was can be whacky
[12:00:11] <sublim20> in australia, it seems 
[12:00:27] <sublim20> s/price was/price wise
[12:00:35] <sublim20> there was an attempt
[12:01:09] <DunceCotus> the Australia tax
[12:01:18] <DunceCotus> we used to have it big-time for electronics, games
[12:01:32] <DunceCotus> used to be like $100 AUD for a Gameboy game
[12:01:52] <DunceCotus> I exaggerate 
[12:01:57] <DunceCotus> more like N64 game
[12:03:15] <DunceCotus> even though we're quite isolated, economy of scale means there's really no excuse for things to be more expensive here
[12:03:35] <DunceCotus> its just because they can/could
[12:05:02] <sublim20> i remember that
[12:05:22] <sublim20> i remember learning about video game prices in australia around the n64 days, and being blown away

[12:09:06] <sublim20> man, i was watching the sopranos the other day

[12:09:21] <DunceCotus> that's awesome
[12:09:36] <DunceCotus> Blast Corps is criminally underrated

[12:10:29] <sublim20> the vulgarity and comedy of the banjo games made them huge
[12:10:38] <sublim20> but im with ya, i never enjoyed them either, and didn't really play them
[12:10:41] <DunceCotus> Banjo-Tooie had a cool multiplayer mode tho
[12:10:57] <DunceCotus> sublim20: I enjoyed Donkey Kong 64
[12:11:01] <DunceCotus> which was also a bit hmmm
