[03:05:21] <cthulchu_> just tried to teach my 9yo bro to code. Tried JS for it just cuz it's so ez. Well, he got the variables. He got the assignment and simple arithmetic with variables.
[03:05:36] <cthulchu_> But then I moved to a for loop and that was too much.

[03:06:17] <cthulchu_> well, I started from doing a simple calculator... where I had to use a reduce and an arrow function... at which point I realized I was moving too fast.
[03:06:57] <cthulchu_> it feels so simple, and yet it's hard to make interesting and exciting. At this point, you start appreciate teachers.

[18:43:44] <Deneb> when you readAsText file it seems to read the whole lot as one blob and you can just assign it to a value (e.g. textarray.value) but not sure how it works with readAsArrayBuffer. I expected content = ev.target.result to return an array, but it doesn't see to.
[18:43:54] <cahoots> my question is why assert isn't more pervasive

[18:44:28] <stenno> assert is specifically for finding bugs, therefore for development purposes only

[18:44:49] <Deneb> content.lenth was undefined
[18:44:54] <austincheney> cahoots, what you are looking for is a particular style of abstraction.  my personal preference is to reduce code to the fewest number of instructions whatever that pattern may be
[18:45:47] <systemfault> Deneb: We still don't know what you're trying to do.
[18:46:31] <systemfault> Deneb: You're focusing on asking us to read a file as binary... but not the source, if you're using a webserver or the file protocol, etc.

[19:00:23] <Deneb> that example seems to have nesting. You have functions within functions and different types of brackets within brackets. I can work it out, it just takes a bit of time to figure out what sits within what.
[19:02:55] <Deneb> I notice though that within getbuffer there was a conversion/cast from arrayBuffer to Uint8Array. That is probably a key bit I am missing. I also need the array to persist at global level as it will be accessed by other functions.

[19:12:11] <stenno> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE
[19:12:21] <silly> it doesn't call itself, parens() are used to call functions
[19:12:39] <silly> (document) in this case
[19:12:47] <systemfault> It's the "old way" to do "modules", a way to isolate your code from the rest.
[19:13:35] <silly> Deneb, when you say iteratively, you mean recursive?

[19:14:36] <Deneb> stenno: thanks for the reference
[19:16:29] <Deneb> ok, so is "runs as soon as it is defined" that similar to an onload? I mean does it run as soon as the parser loads and parses the javascript code?

[19:17:19] <efdee> (that said, tbh, it's quite an outdated pattern, as systemfault just said)
[19:17:27] <silly> moderns js engines have an extra "compile to bytecode" step
