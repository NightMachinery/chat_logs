[02:58:16] <itu> hi
[02:58:38] <emanuele6> hello wikipedia/itu
[02:59:12] <itu> how to  swap/exchange  directly  with sed ?
[02:59:34] <emanuele6> swap/exchange what?
[03:00:13] <itu> say   foo->bar  and   bar->foo
[03:00:38] <itu> strings
[03:01:26] <emanuele6> printf '%s\n' 'hello->world' 'wikipedia->itu' |sed 's/\([[:alpha:]]\{1,\})\)->\([[:alpha:]]\{1,\})\)/\2->\1/'
[03:01:31] <emanuele6> oops
[03:01:33] <emanuele6> # printf '%s\n' 'hello->world' 'wikipedia->itu' |sed 's/\([[:alpha:]]\{1,\})\)->\([[:alpha:]]\{1,\})\)/\2->\1/'
[03:01:34] <shbot> emanuele6: hello->world
[03:01:34] <shbot> emanuele6: wikipedia->itu
[03:01:46] <emanuele6> i messed it up :D
[03:01:58] <emanuele6> yes one extra )
[03:02:08] <emanuele6> # printf '%s\n' 'hello->world' 'wikipedia->itu' |sed 's/\([[:alpha:]]\{1,\}\)->\([[:alpha:]]\{1,\}\)/\2->\1/'
[03:02:09] <shbot> emanuele6: world->hello
[03:02:09] <shbot> emanuele6: itu->wikipedia
[03:02:39] <emanuele6> use whatever regex you prefer instead of [[:alpha:]]\{1,\}
[03:03:10] <emanuele6> the main thing is s/\(..\)->\(..\)/\2->\1/
[03:03:19] <itu> hmmpf
[03:03:48] <itu> could you break that down to simple words like foo an bar ?
[03:03:54] <itu> *and
[03:04:34] <emanuele6> what are you trying to do exactly?
[03:05:02] <emanuele6> swap any   something->SOMETHING  with  SOMETHING->something?
[03:05:24] <emanuele6> what is a something and what is a SOMETHING?
[03:06:26] <emanuele6> if you want to understand the command from before,  [[:alpha:]]\{1,\}  matches any sequence of character formed by one or more letters
[03:06:53] <larryv> i think they want to change all "foo"s into "bar"s and all "bar"s into "foos"
[03:06:54] <emanuele6> e.g.  abc aAd dxd     but not   123 aaa2aa a-a a_A
[03:06:55] <tirnanog> occam's razor would suggest s/foo/bar/g
[03:08:06] <emanuele6> \([[:alpha:]]\{1,\}\)->\([[:alpha:]]\{1,\}\)  matches one of those sequences (that gets saved in \1), followed by "->", followed by another one of those sequences (that gets saved in \2)
[03:08:29] <emanuele6> and then you replace with  \2->\1  that swaps the two sequences
[03:11:13] <itu> .... OK, at that point i suspect ... it is less complicated to do the exchange manually  .... :-/ 
[03:12:15] <emanuele6> if you want to substitute foo->bar with bar->foo, just use s/foo->bar/bar->foo/g ...
[03:12:52] <emanuele6> since you said "exchange" and "swap" i assumed you wanted something more general, not just a replacement.
[03:13:32] <emanuele6> larryv: oh, you think that those are supposed to be arrows?
[03:14:04] <larryv> yeah that's how i interpreted it, casually
[03:14:24] <itu> echo foo__bar__foo  | sed   's/foo->bar/bar->foo/g'    # does not work
[03:14:24] <emanuele6> man, i didn't even think of that
[03:14:33] <tirnanog> tee hee.
[03:15:10] <emanuele6> itu: sed -e $'s/foo/\n/g' -e $'s/\n/bar/g'
[03:15:50] <emanuele6> i thought you wanted to replace    'this->is a->sentence' with 'is->this sentence->a'
[03:16:12] <emanuele6> oops, i meant  sed -e $'s/foo/\\\n/g' -e $'s/\\\n/bar/g'
[03:16:27] <emanuele6> # echo foo__bar__foo | sed -e $'s/foo/\\\n/g' -e $'s/\\\n/bar/g'
[03:16:28] <shbot> emanuele6: bar__bar__bar
[03:16:50] <emanuele6> # echo foo__bar__foo | sed -e $'s/foo/\\\n/g' -e s/bar/foo/g -e $'s/\\\n/bar/g'
[03:16:51] <shbot> emanuele6: bar__foo__bar
[03:17:01] <emanuele6> and don't forget s/bar/foo/g :)

[03:21:04] <itu> yes that of course worked ....  but i imagined sed must have some simple solution , while this is not doing it directly ....
[03:21:07] *** Quits: seninha (~seninha@user/seninha) (Quit: Leaving)
[03:21:58] <itu> i realize that simple solution may not exist
[03:23:00] <itu> chosing some intermediate-string is coding the problem  not sed doing it 
[03:23:20] <emanuele6> you can safely use \n
[03:23:26] <emanuele6> as i have done above
[03:23:38] <emanuele6> since sed reads only one line at a time
[03:23:52] <emanuele6> (unless you manually read a second line with the `N' command)
[03:24:26] <itu> there are much things i can use safely (depending on problem)  .... 
[03:24:59] <emanuele6> \n is always safe
[03:25:32] <itu> i imagined  there is something  like easy     x/foo/bar/g    , but it may not exist  such easy solution 
[03:25:58] <larryv> there isn't a sed command dedicated to every textual manipulation you can think of
[03:26:06] <itu> ok
[03:26:13] <emanuele6> the x command exchanges pattern space and hold space, there is no command to swap two wards
[03:26:30] <itu> ok
[03:27:25] <itu> nothing for bad
[03:29:06] <emanuele6> you could use perl
[03:29:08] <tirnanog> yep.
[03:29:16] <emanuele6>   perl -snpe 's/\E$a/\n/g;s/\E$b/\E$a/g;s/\n(?!$)/$b/g' -- -a=foo -b=bar
[03:29:21] <tirnanog> perl -pe 's/(foo|bar)/$1 eq "foo" ? "bar" : "foo"/ge'
[03:29:23] <emanuele6> then you only have to type foo and bar once
[03:29:33] <emanuele6> or that yes
[03:29:42] * emanuele6 doesn't know enough perl.
[03:29:49] * itu too
[03:30:43] <tirnanog> even if you don't, it's fairly obvious what it's doing. the key is the e modifier to allow for code as replacement.
[03:31:04] <emanuele6> yeah, but i didn't know that was possible! :D

[17:25:52] <Earnestly> I don't understand questions like this

[17:26:48] <Earnestly> That is, for no other reason.  No intention of learning anything, just the thrill of making someone else do something for them
[17:27:43] <lopid> i like to assume they have access to irc only 
[17:27:45] <Earnestly> Think about it: it's in channel topic, it's in man page NAME, it's first sentence of man page DESCRIPTION, and second sentence
[17:28:16] <Earnestly> lopid: topic even uses capitalisation to emphsise it
[17:28:22] <lopid> yeah
[17:28:46] <lopid> maybe people ought to be forced to type out the first line of a channel's topic when they join it

[17:29:11] <lopid> /topic
[17:29:23] <Earnestly> Hm, I'm not suggesting changes, but it's a pattern I've observed here and elsewhere.  It's more interesting as a phenomenon
[17:29:59] <Earnestly> I've experience with people like this "irl"
[17:30:13] <Atque> Earnestly: I did notice that after asking.
[17:30:51] <Earnestly> Oh to be sure, I don't care that people ask these sorts of questions, I just find them crazy
[17:31:11] <Earnestly> crazy in the sense that it sort of blows my mind a bit
[17:31:40] <Atque> Earnestly: Blowing up your mind doesn't seem ideal. You might need it later for things.
[17:33:15] <Earnestly> I'm not sure the future is going to have such a requirement
[17:36:07] <Atque> Yeah. I need an IRC client where I can pipe everything through sed s/sed/stream\ editor/
[17:43:05] <llua> sic
[17:47:29] <emanuele6> sed -e '1i\'$'\n''NICK sedsedsed\'$'\n''USER sedsedsed 0 * :' -e 's/sed/stream editor/' < /dev/tcp/libera.chat/6669
