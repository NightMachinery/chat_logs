[11:28:33] <Renderwww> is it the year of loonix yet? this year must be it!
[11:28:39] <jotham> that was 2002 mate
[11:28:52] <jotham> wmaker on the desktop, debian, x forwarding wmaker applets from remote servers
[11:28:58] <jotham> shit was popping off
[11:29:00] <jotham> everyone missed it
[11:38:40] <jotham> https://quad.pe/e/05l8DhkxU8.png
[11:45:32] <Crocodillian> Renderwww: yes, Microsoft will give you all the lunix you can eat, free of charge.

[11:46:25] <Carbonflux> Microsoft bought Bethseda after all, they are full of love now.
[11:46:57] <Crocodillian> I'm fine with that, except making TES6 an xbox exclusive is a shitty move.
[11:47:02] <Carbonflux> i like it
[11:47:13] <Crocodillian> But whatever, I'll buy a fucking xbox.
[11:47:18] <Carbonflux> Bill is gone, Balmer is gone
[11:47:47] <Carbonflux> they bought a game corp that is actually dedicated to complex games.
[11:47:56] <Carbonflux> i think they are doing good
[11:48:24] <Carbonflux> Balmer fucked a lot of stuff up
[11:48:46] <Carbonflux> i was there when he was running the place, it was reorg after reorg 
[11:48:51] <Crocodillian> yeah I like a lot of stuff they have been doing recently, and I really like Windows much better and PowerShell and the new terminal etc.
[11:49:29] <Renderwww> I wonder if they make Id use DirectShitX instead of Vulkan now
[11:49:53] <Crocodillian> why bother, vulkan works great on windows
[11:50:35] <Crocodillian> does vulkan work on macos?
[11:50:55] <jotham> https://developer.nvidia.com/transitioning-opengl-vulkan
[11:51:03] <jotham> totally still depends aye
[11:51:41] <Renderwww> there is a vulkan to mental translation layer
[11:53:04] <Crocodillian> have you heard of WSLG? They are making a fully accelerated Wayland server for WSL, you'll be able to run a full gnome desktop or whatever.
[11:53:55] <Renderwww> brilliant, you get the shit ui from loonix with the crappile base system of windows 
[11:53:58] <Renderwww> worst of all worlds
[11:56:06] <Crocodillian> Well, WSL is mostly a meme anyway. I am more interested in doing native ports for chocolatey and working in PowerShell.

[11:58:02] <Crocodillian> I've been working on and off on this guide for this, if anyone is interested: https://github.com/rkitover/windows-dev-guide
[11:59:04] <Renderwww> my guide would be: intall visual studio, the end
[12:00:28] <Crocodillian> not my cup of tea, I only use it to debug an .exe, or if I need to for something
[12:00:56] <Crocodillian> because unfortunately gdb doesn't work with VS symbols yet
[12:03:00] <jotham> https://quad.pe/e/8GciqQ8wYo.png
[12:03:03] <Renderwww> not sure if that guide is applicable to anyone except you
[12:03:29] <Crocodillian> well some people told me they like it
[12:03:38] <Crocodillian> but I have a lot more work to do on it
[12:05:29] <Crocodillian> and IMHO it's not a bad intro to pwsh usage
[12:10:58] <Renderwww> what I mean is that guide contains so many different very specific things it doesn't look like a "Windows Native Development Environment Setup Guide for Linux Users" to me. Also I have no idea what such a guide would look like because it would totally depend on what you are going to develop on bingdows
[12:12:56] <jotham> so far wsl 1 and wsl 2 or whatever have been big failures from my pov
[12:13:04] <jotham> i still find just using mingw is better
[12:13:12] <jotham> in terms of disk access, network access
[12:13:27] <jotham> plus weird filesystem interop between windows and wsl is fucked
[12:13:35] <Crocodillian> you mean msys2?
[12:13:39] <jotham> i mean i have linux on all 4 of my laptops, and windows on my desktop
[12:14:03] <jotham> whatever Crocodillian, i still think of it as https://www.mingw-w64.org/ 
[12:14:13] <jotham> since i've been using it for years
[12:14:49] <jotham> used it with cygwin until i decided that was shithouse, so i guess you're right msys2
[12:15:09] <Crocodillian> Renderwww: it explains how to use a package manager (chocolatey), and how to use vim and VS build tools to develop in the terminal.
[12:15:28] <jotham> choco is okay 
[12:15:37] <jotham> vim is my babe
[12:15:43] <jotham> was weird porting my vimrc to windows
[12:16:03] <jotham> been trying to use powershell more and more
[12:16:04] <Crocodillian> btw choco has a mingw package
[12:16:15] <Crocodillian> see link above, may be useful for you
[12:16:22] <Renderwww> http://pm1.narvii.com/6356/f679e00e8fa0c65c7c11010087176905c3927d61_hq.jpg typical Vi user
[12:16:34] <jotham> wish i looked like that Renderwww 
[12:16:54] <jotham> could quit my job babysitting programmers
[12:16:57] <jotham> and become a camgirl
[12:16:58] <Carbonflux> hahahah
[12:16:59] <jotham> or boy
[12:17:00] <Carbonflux> i wish
[12:17:12] <Carbonflux> i had VI totally memorized at one point
[12:17:14] <jotham> a cam fellow human
[12:17:23] <Carbonflux> i never looked that hot tho
[12:17:27] <Carbonflux> heh
[12:17:30] <Renderwww> typical vim user: https://www.vim.org/images/vim_drill_small.JPG
[12:17:42] <jotham> haha i always love that pic
[12:17:50] <jotham> doon't even need to click it and i chuckle
[12:17:51] <Carbonflux> lol
[12:19:06] <Renderwww> how long before vim gets canceled over that image?
[12:19:37] <jotham> never
[12:19:38] <Crocodillian> btw visual studio has a vim keys plugin
[12:19:44] <jotham> yeah it's horrible Crocodillian 
[12:19:45] <jotham> haha
[12:19:51] <jotham> i use vscode a bit with the vim plugin
[12:19:53] <Renderwww> it's better than not having that plugin
[12:20:03] <Renderwww> vscode is a totally different crap pile
[12:20:16] <Crocodillian> I just use vim for C++, the include search is builtin and all I need for IDE features
[12:20:32] <jotham> when you use vim all the time and you have a custom vimrc, you are used to key strokes that aren't default vim, so the vim plugin for vscode means you get lulled into a sense of confidence about what you're doing, but then hit a wall cause your muscle memory makes you try use a plugin
[12:20:33] <Renderwww> I wish they didn't name it visual studio code because it's nothing like the other visual studio
[12:20:39] <jotham> it's like a break of immersion 
[12:21:16] <Carbonflux> i don't know, vscode seems more like a pile of mods to me, i kind of like it, selectively, because you can alter it.
[12:21:20] <Crocodillian> yeah that's why I can't use things like doom-emacs, vile has no ex command support
[12:21:38] <jotham> only ide i fight with these days is intellij and its sister android studio
[12:21:43] <jotham> otherwise i never touch ides these days
[12:21:43] <Crocodillian> so you still have to learn emacs
[12:22:12] <Renderwww> undo with the vim plugin in vscode was broken and made that unusable for me, no clue if it is fixed now
[12:22:12] <jotham> i used emacs for years before vim, then i found myself in xemacs playing tetris one day, realised it was a fucking OS, and that chording was giving me RSI
[12:22:15] <jotham> and quit it and ran away to vim
[12:24:10] <Crocodillian> and btw VS comes with cmake and ninja, so doing C++ dev in the terminal is totally fine
[12:24:25] <jotham> i haven't programmed cpp commercially since 2009
[12:24:28] <jotham> heh
[12:24:33] <jotham> visual studio proper was good for my life back then
[12:24:45] <jotham> now whenever i need something like C i just hack up some actual C
[12:26:18] <Crocodillian> MS does not like C very much, but VS does compile most C stuff
[12:26:38] <Crocodillian> I think it's missing a few things from the latest standards
[12:27:19] <jotham> my mate was freaking out about powershell not being able to do something (using win32 sound device / wmi)
[12:27:25] <jotham> and said he refused to install a compiler
[12:27:41] <jotham> found this though https://blog.adamfurmanek.pl/2016/03/19/executing-c-code-using-powershell-script/
[12:27:51] <jotham> haha so he wrote his whole bullshit thing as a string inside of powershelll
[12:28:00] <jotham> seems clumsy to me instead of just installing a c# ide
[12:28:12] <jotham> people put the weirdest constraints around what they are trying to do
[12:29:19] <Renderwww> doesn't windows always ship with the .not framework? that c# compiler must be  sitting around somewhere
[12:29:38] <jotham> yeah these days i think so
[12:29:57] <Crocodillian> powershell has full access to all of .net, and often you have to use it
[12:30:12] <Renderwww> never used it!
[12:30:31] <Crocodillian> also, the full .net core is ported to linux, so it's not too hard to make portable scripts
[12:31:09] <jotham> i'd just use python or something on linux
[12:31:10] <Crocodillian> and I've done that
[12:31:16] <jotham> my day job is looking after linux though
[12:33:03] <Crocodillian> I actually like powershell a lot, I did perl for many years and powershell is like the spiritual successor to perl5
[12:33:15] <Crocodillian> and it actually works great on linux
[12:35:00] <jotham> i like how it's typed, and lots of the SO threads are people struggling with the very idea it's typed *but* available in the shell
[12:35:07] <jotham> like it's what every bash programmer always wanted
[12:35:57] <Renderwww> just use node + typescript for all your scripting needs *trollface*
[12:37:08] <jotham> i haven't tried typescript
[12:37:15] <Crocodillian> me neither
[12:37:17] <jotham> i have a few node things running for customers that i wrote
[12:37:22] <jotham> i find for apis it's better than python
[12:37:23] <Crocodillian> I actually don't mind javascript, it's not terrible
[12:37:47] <jotham> i have a nodejs thing i wrote that is an access database adapter to a restful front end for web apps for a billing system
[12:37:49] <jotham> and it works great
[12:37:55] <Crocodillian> most javscript hate is because of browsers and terrible npm modules
[12:37:57] <jotham> i tried to do it in python and it was a mess
[12:38:01] <jotham> the node solution worked better
[12:38:54] <Crocodillian> and ES6 added a lot of good stuff
[12:39:02] <Crocodillian> I haven't even learned that properly yet
[12:42:40] <Crocodillian> and there's really nothing wrong with the prototype object model js uses
[12:42:51] <jotham> haha
[12:42:57] <jotham> none of my js programmer mates or i use it
[12:43:00] <jotham> we just use closures
[12:43:05] <jotham> oop is a shitty idea
[12:43:11] <jotham> https://quad.pe/e/ULGzcfTs25.png
[12:43:21] <jotham> but yes if you want to do oop with JS, prototypes are fine
[12:43:48] <jotham> i don't deal with js much these days, did a lot around 2k10
[12:44:37] <Crocodillian> ES6 also adds many good functional features
[12:45:57] <jotham> js is what got me into fp, which now annoys the shit out of me in python
[12:46:02] <jotham> cause python is very ugly at fp
[12:46:23] <jotham> frankly most of my day is consumed by reading java or php, so whatever
[12:46:30] <jotham> i am not a programmer anymore, after 20 years
[12:46:39] <jotham> make more money for less work babysitting commercial contract devs
[12:46:46] <jotham> and learning whatever the shit they use
[12:53:53] <Renderwww> https://i.imgur.com/KrZVDsP.png
[13:02:25] <jotham> haha
[13:02:35] <jotham> i think that's why i hate oop aye
[13:02:38] <jotham> noun is clown
[13:02:55] <jotham> i remember getting yelled at by some lead dev
[13:03:01] <jotham> because the tooling he had to use
[13:03:04] <jotham> wasn't an absolute black box
[13:03:08] <jotham> i said maybe we can find the source
[13:03:13] <jotham> or disassemble it
[13:03:17] <jotham> and work out why it's fucking out
[13:03:20] <jotham> and he freaked out
[13:03:26] <jotham> cause it broke all the oop rules
[13:03:30] <jotham> i just wanted the fucking program to work
[13:03:45] <jotham> maybe we reach into the fucking black box, monkey patch the black box, and move on with our lives
[13:03:59] <jotham> then work out how to not let the package manager clobber us in 6 months
[13:04:07] <Faux> That's not even the bad bit of oop; they've touched on it there. The author has confused data and behaviour in the worst way. Having exceptionahndlers and loggers injected is a thing I believe in, and suffer with lacking in non-arse languages.
[13:04:36] <jotham> yeah okay that's a fair point
[13:04:43] <jotham> a lot of this promise culture in multiple languages
[13:04:53] <jotham> has very obscure ways to inject logging and exception handling
[13:04:57] <Renderwww> let's just inject lol4j everywher
[13:05:01] <jotham> and even then things get blackholed all the time
[13:05:08] <jotham> cause there is no enforced policy
[13:05:25] <jotham> i look after this system that is responsible for a few things
[13:05:32] <jotham> on its surface it's a bunch of lanyards
[13:05:37] <jotham> and it's a shared office space
[13:05:44] <jotham> across 3-4 buildings
[13:05:51] <jotham> but they use the lanyards for a bunch of things
[13:05:57] <jotham> 1- door scanning to get in / out
[13:06:03] <jotham> 2- buying food / drink at the cafe
[13:06:04] <Crocodillian> Faux: boost::di?
[13:06:08] <jotham> 3- printing
[13:06:13] <Faux> It's not a great example by itself, but the point of injecting lol4j is that you *can* switch implementation.
[13:06:21] <jotham> and the entire thing is shoehorned together and is a total disaster
[13:06:29] <jotham> and the worst bit is half the errors just get blackholed
[13:06:34] <Faux> Crocodillian: Java/C# is the only language with a realistic implementation of this enterprise garbage.
[13:06:38] <jotham> cause the developers used python to make it and used the threading module
[13:06:41] <jotham> and some of its nodejs too
[13:06:50] <jotham> there is no coherent way to evaluate a fault situation
[13:07:02] <jotham> i've spent 6 months adding in log shipping and central loggers everywhere
[13:07:14] <Crocodillian> Faux: I was reading a great C++20 book recently that covers boost::di
[13:07:16] <jotham> most of the bugs are actually the normal ones- date time calculation
[13:07:17] <Faux> ^ kubernetes
[13:07:57] <Faux> I'm afraid the ship has sailed for me on c++ being a reasonable language to write enterprise applications in.
[13:08:12] <Faux> To the point that seeing people trying to fix it is quite comical.
[13:08:38] <Crocodillian> Faux: well if you're interested, https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Modern-Approaches-Object-Oriented-ebook/dp/B09L5RN2C3/
[13:08:45] <Renderwww>  at least you get a good laugh out of it
[13:08:49] <Crocodillian> Faux: I was reading this in the psychiatric hospital
[13:09:06] <Faux> Haven't even managed to read Concurrency In Action yet, which is probably at least slightly interesting to me. :)
[13:09:48] <Crocodillian> this one is a quick light read
[13:09:51] <Crocodillian> it's just some examples
[13:10:55] <jotham> are you our channel jehova's witness, Crocodillian 
[13:11:02] <jotham> the jeho of cpp
[13:11:07] <jotham> everyone knows it's dead in the water
[13:11:27] <Renderwww> second coming of jestroustrup is near!
[13:11:34] <jotham> hehe
[13:11:46] <Crocodillian> I'm still not completely up to speed on some things in modern c++, like move semantics, but that's the last thing I need to learn.
[13:12:01] <Crocodillian> I finally get smart pointers.
[13:12:11] <jotham> google has all but said, with our infinite money and infinite iq, we can't make cpp safe
[13:12:13] <jotham> so fuck it
[13:12:16] <jotham> (their words not mine)
[13:12:51] <Crocodillian> microsoft is actually doing a lot of work to move modern C++ forward
[13:13:11] <Crocodillian> another reason I like them
[13:13:13] <Renderwww> everyone who shills c++ is paid by the NSA!!!!
[13:13:17] <jotham>  probably sunk cost though aye
[13:13:25] <jotham> it's a bitch to wrap your head around
[13:13:30] <jotham> so gotta get paid for wasting that time
[13:14:14] <Crocodillian> what is the alternative, rust? it's not that much better, and c++ will catch up
[13:14:59] <Faux> Nah, people won't write enterprise applications in rust.
[13:15:06] <Faux> Being specific here.
[13:15:32] <Crocodillian> no, c++/rust is for other purposes
[13:16:32] <Crocodillian> high performance apps, GUIs, games, etc.
[13:17:08] <Crocodillian> you're not going to get anything better than c++ with qt for making a GUI for example
[13:20:02] <Faux> Society has decided that, in fact, you're better using js and react and chrome.
[13:20:14] <Faux> And we're fucked, but we'll see where that goes.
[13:20:43] <Crocodillian> yeah but you're not going to do that for an app that actually matters

[13:22:59] <Renderwww> I can't wait for the future where everything is an electron app shipped as a flatpak to be run inside WSL
[13:23:05] <Faux> Yeah.
[13:23:20] <Faux> Arguably better than everything being subscription sASS.
[13:23:39] <Renderwww> obviously you still need a subscriptionto use that app
[13:24:06] <Faux> So the discord desktop app.
[13:24:20] <Crocodillian> I just run discord in the browser
[13:24:20] <Faux> Or Slack or Teams etc.

[13:27:56] <Crocodillian> regardless, whether you use electron or qt or whatever, GUI programming is tedious, long, painstaking and hard
[13:28:21] <Crocodillian> using browser shit does not make it easier really

[13:42:55] <jotham> is this something i'll see on CVs now
[13:43:00] <jotham> a kinda anathema
[13:43:04] <jotham> like c/cpp
[13:43:10] <jotham> or linux/unix
[13:43:15] <jotham> all dumb fucked terms
[13:43:16] <jotham> on cvs
[13:43:20] <jotham> placed by arseholes

[13:44:16] <jotham> i haven't seen rust in a cv yet
[13:44:33] <jotham> do you reckon it'll be rust/cpp or what

[14:58:20] <Carbonflux> what about posix?
[14:59:04] <Carbonflux> c/c++ used to be a fair term before "modern" c++ imo

[21:42:30] <T`alZHeimeR> spent afternoon debugging systemd services dependencies, retarded modem dhcp server config, ipxe configuration
[21:42:37] <T`alZHeimeR> my life is so awesome
[21:43:17] <dukwon> germany changed its rules about pre-departure PCR tests on the 23rd
[21:43:31] <dukwon> from 72h before to 48h before
[21:43:51] <dukwon> unfortunately i read a news article dated the 22nd before i booked my test
[21:44:06] <jotham> hopefully i can get my pfizer booster this week
[21:44:10] <jotham> pretty dumb
[21:44:17] <jotham> nz got down to 50 delta cases a day
[21:44:24] <jotham> and now we have omicron
[21:44:34] <jotham> we'd almost wiped it out for the second time
[21:44:38] *** Joins: jsbach (~jsbach@2a01:c23:6522:d500:37a9:9618:f7ed:34e9)
[21:44:49] <dukwon> so not only did i have to pay £100 over the odds for a test in (what I thought was) the right time frame without having to travel ages, it wasn't even valid
[21:45:02] <dukwon> £165 wasted in all
[21:45:40] <dukwon> plus £35 for a new (antigen) test for monday and about €40 for moving tickets
[21:46:13] <jotham> that sucks
[21:46:26] <dukwon> this trip has cost me €583.79 (of which €310 is covid tests)
[21:46:41] <dukwon> and just to be miserable at my parents house for 2 and a bit week
[21:46:43] <dukwon> s
[21:46:56] <jotham> mum and her bf are both doing chemo atm
[21:47:06] <jotham> so i didn't spend xmas with them
[21:47:19] <jotham> figured if i gave them covid it'd be a fucking shit sandwich
[21:47:34] <jotham> also couples chemo is funny
[21:47:37] <jotham> very bleak
[21:58:34] <MaNI> how many times do you have to "almost wipe it out" only for a new version to appear before its okay to admit that "wiping it out" is a futile/pointless endevour? 
[21:59:07] <jotham> twice
[21:59:10] <jotham> just twice
[21:59:12] <jotham> in two years
[21:59:37] <jotham> maybe three times given one stupid medical misadventure
[21:59:42] <jotham> but we've only had two 'waves'
[22:00:08] <jotham> we've largely lived as an entirely free hermit kingdom, all our kids have gone to school and got properly socialised
[22:00:14] <jotham> omicron is gonna change that i think
[22:00:43] <jotham> https://www.health.govt.nz/sites/default/files/images/our-work/diseases-conditions/covid19/daily_cases-2021-12-31.png
[22:01:36] <jotham> cause every country i look at their current situation is just a fucking massive straight up growth in cases once they get omi
[22:01:42] <jotham> that dwarfs all else
[22:02:07] <MaNI> I'm hoping we are nearing the point where we can just honestly admit "wait a minute this variant is less deadly than the sniffles, why are we hiding like a bunch of retards" and then move on with our lives
[22:02:12] <MaNI> that would make for a great 2022
[22:02:21] <jotham> almost wiping it out without destroying society has so far been a very successful process here
[22:02:25] <jotham> like i said
[22:02:28] <jotham> kids are getting socialised
[22:02:33] <jotham> we largely are safe and free
[22:02:51] <jotham> but i think omicron will absolutely swamp our limited hospitals
[22:03:03] <jotham> https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/ been watching this
[22:03:14] <jotham> i don't trust american data, their health care system is very weird
[22:03:18] <jotham> but uk i can understand better
[22:03:21] <jotham> same with germany
[22:04:03] <jotham> yeah mani, since the start of the pandemic the scientists have said, ultimately we need a less deadly more active strain to outbreed the dangerous strains and take over the genetic niche
[22:04:11] <jotham> which maybe will be the blessing of omicron
[22:05:20] <jotham> weird biproduct of the whole plague
[22:05:27] <jotham> i hadn't had a cold in over 2 years
[22:05:28] <jotham> ...
[22:05:31] <jotham> until christmas
[22:05:45] <jotham> got massive lung butter action from my friends kid
[22:05:55] <jotham> kids will always be maximum plague rat aye
[22:10:31] <dukwon> i could have bought plane tickets for less money and done less tests
[22:11:09] <jotham> to be fucking fair
[22:11:27] <jotham> have you guys shot covid down the particle accelerator for a laugh
[22:11:33] <dukwon> not yet
[22:11:44] <dukwon> i don't get why flying is cheaper than trains
[22:11:54] <dukwon> flying is way worse for the environment
[22:12:22] <dukwon> https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/16D76/production/_108485539_optimised-travel_carbon-nc.png
[22:12:34] <jotham> the answer is that your seat is subsidized by cargo in the hold
[22:12:39] <jotham> and it's all just supply chain
[22:13:31] <dukwon> 40x the CO2 should mean 40x the price
[22:13:41] <dukwon> but it's half the price
[22:14:29] <jotham> reality is the cost isn't built into the market
[22:14:35] <jotham> only time i ever saw cost built into a market
[22:14:48] <jotham> was when i lived in netherlands and appliances included their recycling / EOL price
[22:15:57] <jotham> to go to my friends house here in NZ, if I cycled or walked would be about 150 dollars and a week of time, if i drove would be about 450 dollars (ferry for cars + gas) if i flew would be 45-60 dollars
[22:16:06] <jotham> planes are ridiculously cheap
