[03:55:25] <elkclone> for further reading cat /etc/login.defs file as useradd reads that file I think.

[04:00:21] <pycurious> I've a peculiar security issue. I've a client whose web app has authenticated a user and wants to let us know that the user is logged in and wants to run a particular task on our webserver. How do authenticate this REST endpoint on our end (to make sure that the user is who he claims he is, before we run the job requested).  To reiterate : [ User <—> Web server 1 ]. User browser needs to ping WebSever 2 to do a job. How does Webserve
[04:00:21] <pycurious> r 2 know who the user is? (without an explicit login / automatically preferably) — if I go with a solution that webserver 1 tells webserver 2 that this user wants to run something - how does webserver 2 trust webserver 1's request?

[07:13:30] <SineDeviance> with some of the Dell cards it's better to flash them with LSI IT firmware and use them as HBAs
[07:13:50] <SineDeviance> you can get way better performance out of them using them as HBAs with software RAID
[07:14:17] <Hash> hehe he's cool accent
[07:14:20] <Hash> :D
[07:14:53] <SineDeviance> I don't use RAID on anything; instead, I use storage spaces in Windows (another reason for hyper-V) and I run veaam endpoint to do nightly snapshots of the entire server and dump them on redundant 2.5" spinning disks for backups

[07:16:28] <SineDeviance> Hydragyrum: but really, that card is quite outdated. if you can, replace it. perc H200 or H310 are good replacement options, get whichever is cheaper
[07:16:51] <Hydragyrum> replacing the card might be a bigger pain than replacing the whole server
[07:17:07] <Hydragyrum> which I'll get around to doing sometime after I replace my laptop
[07:17:13] <SineDeviance> yeah, possibly. depends on how many drive bays yours has
[07:17:23] <SineDeviance> if it only has 4 or 8 bays, you're good. direct swap.

[07:17:36] <SineDeviance> okay. then yeah, you should be able to do a direct swap
[07:18:02] <SineDeviance> each card has 2x SAS ports which can support up to 4x drives each
[07:18:16] <SineDeviance> however I believe the perc 6i had 3x SAS ports
[07:18:41] <Hydragyrum> yeah it runs in a 3x2 configuration here
[07:18:54] <SineDeviance> ahhh
[07:19:18] <SineDeviance> then yes, you'd be better off upgrading to a newer server
[07:19:32] <SineDeviance> your backplane is not setup for 4x SAS breakout
[07:20:53] <Hydragyrum> though considering budget and such, probably minimum 6 months before I'm seriously looking at hardware upgrades
[07:21:24] <SineDeviance> well, you could always just buy two H310s or H200s :)
[07:21:26] <Hydragyrum> gotta get new apartment and car and such
[07:21:30] <Hash> RAID controller often has to rebuild an entire disk, but ZFS can combine disk and file knowledge to limit any rebuilding to data which is actually missing or corrupt, greatly speeding up rebuilding
[07:21:34] <SineDeviance> that would allow you to re-use existing backplane and cabling
[07:21:43] <SineDeviance> but you'll lose a PCI-E slot obviously
[07:21:51] <Hydragyrum> Hash, I know zfs is better, I love zfs
[07:22:12] <Hydragyrum> SineDeviance, h200 costs nearly half as much as my whole server cost me according to a quick scan of ebay

[07:23:11] <SineDeviance> RAID is good for performance on spinning disks. not so good for data redundancy. the problem with RAID is that one or more additional drives are likely to fail when you are rebuilding the first one that failed

[20:53:54] <ElectricGandalf> That's what I figured.
[20:53:57] <SineDeviance> some really old things only support SMTP over port 25
[20:53:59] <SineDeviance> that kinda stuff
[20:53:59] <ElectricGandalf> I run my own services.
[20:54:06] <SineDeviance> yeah, that isn't an option here
[20:54:15] <ElectricGandalf> You should run your own mail server and secure the old stuff properly
[20:54:17] <SineDeviance> no
[20:54:22] <ElectricGandalf> Then I can't help you.
[20:54:25] <ElectricGandalf> I don't know any services.
[20:54:26] <SineDeviance> This is for clients, that's outside of our scope
[20:54:29] <ElectricGandalf> My apologies
[20:54:48] <ElectricGandalf> Though
[20:54:57] <ElectricGandalf> Hm.. No that might no twork.
[20:54:58] <SineDeviance> If I wanted to be a mailserver admin I'd run my own mailserver. Instead I do the sensible thing and rent one from a good provider instead

[20:56:10] <SineDeviance> I have clients that are on Google Workspaces and O365 Exchange, and lately it's like pulling teeth getting some printers/on-prem PBX systems/custom apps to send mail through them, so it's time to look for alternatives
[20:56:26] <ajak> do these things *need* to send mail to the internet?
[20:56:36] <SineDeviance> Setting up a linux vm with a postfix/dovecot stack is a solution, but a very poor one. the likelyhood that those emails will be blocked by spam filters is very high
[20:56:41] <SineDeviance> and the ongoing maintenance
[20:56:43] <SineDeviance> ajak: yes
[20:56:45] <ElectricGandalf> I use gmail in mutt.
[20:57:02] <ElectricGandalf> I have to generate an app password credential for the old app to use.
[20:57:08] <SineDeviance> ajak: one example is an ERP system that sends customer signup request emails and order confirmation emails. if that doesn't happen the system stops working
[20:57:22] <ElectricGandalf> Perhaps your old app can login to google to send mail with app password.
[20:57:33] <ajak> sounds like this infra is poorly designed
[20:57:34] <ElectricGandalf> Google is SMTP to non 25 for encryption
[20:57:40] <ElectricGandalf> to send mails
[20:57:40] <SineDeviance> printers, well, for some we can do scan-to-local-share, but with more people working offsite these days or for situations where a client needs to scan something directly to a customer that doesn't work
[20:57:42] <ajak> if they are unupdatable they should be replaced
[20:58:08] <ElectricGandalf> https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/360004467631-Sign-in-using-App-Passwords-Gmail-SMTP
[20:58:09] <SineDeviance> ajak: yeah, good luck telling a company that
[20:58:09] <secbot> ^ Sign in using App Passwords - Gmail SMTP – Salesmate
[20:58:09] <ajak> because, remember, using this at all is exposing $CLIENT to bad things
[20:58:23] <ElectricGandalf> If you use 2-Step-Verification and are seeing a “password incorrect” or "Cannot connect to SMTP Server" error when trying to access your Google Account, an App password may solve the problem.
[20:58:23] <ajak> if you're doing their security, isn't that your job? :)
[20:58:50] <SineDeviance> ajak: I am not doing their security. the companies that wrote their apps and/or provided their printers are responsible for that. my job is just to make it all work together whenever possible

[20:58:56] <secbot> ^ Send email from a printer, scanner, or app - Google Workspace Admin Help
[20:59:12] <ajak> ah ok, if you don't care about their security why not continue the status quo?
[20:59:18] <ElectricGandalf> We recommend using the Google Workspace SMTP relay service to send mail from these devices because it authenticates with IP addresses.
[20:59:39] <ajak> ElectricGandalf: i don't think anyone is talking about google right now except you
[20:59:47] <ajak> which makes you noise
[21:00:05] <ElectricGandalf> Other than just chatting and wasting people's time, I've yet to see any actual help come from that dude.
[21:00:07] <ElectricGandalf> *shrug*
[21:00:15] <SineDeviance> ajak: because it's not going to keep working forever; security policies at the large mail providers are changing (which is good) but this is leaving behind old applications and devices that do not support OAuth2, MFA, etc.)
[21:00:53] <ajak> they don't really need to support oauth or mfa i think, just TLS is the important thing right now
[21:01:17] <SineDeviance> ElectricGandalf: SMTP relay requires on-prem email servers, none of these businesses have that anymore. they went to cloud to do AWAY with that
[21:01:19] <ajak> hopefully plaintext smtp isn't going to work forever, either
[21:01:26] <ElectricGandalf> hmm
[21:02:09] <ElectricGandalf> Google has port 25 open, STARTTLS, just don't use STRTTLS and perhaps it will fallback to PLAIN
[21:02:18] <SineDeviance> ElectricGandalf: it doesn't
[21:02:19] <ElectricGandalf> But MITM can steal your credentials
[21:02:29] <ElectricGandalf> Configuration options
[21:02:32] <ElectricGandalf> Port 25, 465, or 587
[21:02:36] <SineDeviance> if the app or device does not support SSL/TLS it basically doesn't work with Google or O365 anymore
[21:02:42] <ajak> ... good
[21:02:49] <ElectricGandalf> Oh well dang.
[21:02:50] <ElectricGandalf> Man.
[21:02:50] <SineDeviance> ajak: not disagreeing with you there
[21:02:55] <ElectricGandalf> :(
[21:03:00] * ElectricGandalf hugs SineDeviance
[21:03:22] <ajak> so, you're stuck with a bunch of crusty systems that need plaintext smtp
[21:03:28] <ajak> the ways forward are pretty clear i think
[21:03:50] <minall> ajak So my attack right now can inject an example code like         <a href="/search/?q=javascript:alert(1);&categorySlug=something" class="mainCategory__level2">Something</a>... Is this a vulnerability?

[21:05:41] <SineDeviance> i'll keep looking, was just wondering if someone here had dealt with this situation before
[21:05:41] <ElectricGandalf> Same as I said man.
[21:05:49] <ElectricGandalf> Real only solution, gotta run your own relay.
[21:05:59] <ElectricGandalf> Sorry but the most best solutions are to do it yourself.
[21:06:03] <ElectricGandalf> And it's not hard either.

[21:06:28] <ajak> well, the only solution is to do it yourself (because that's the only thing that prevents plaintext email going over the internet)

[21:14:01] <SineDeviance> I don't care how trivial it is

[21:16:10] <Hash> yeah.

[21:17:31] <MadCamel> Unfortunately a local relay is really the only way to solve your compatibility issues unless you want to use a cloud provider that explicitly allows insecure connection methods
[21:17:40] <ajak> SineDeviance: Hash isn't big on understanding, it's ok
[21:17:40] <Hash> MadCamel: I know. \o/
[21:17:55] <SineDeviance> when you have a monthly agreement that is only, say, $1,500 a month all-in, it's a real hard ask to say "let's tack a grand on to that so we can get paid for buildiing and maintaining a mailserver you didn't want and actually don't really need"
[21:18:04] <Hash> A relay is very trivial to setup. You just relay to another MTA, you don't setup anything else. The most trivial.
[21:18:11] <Hash> Debian comes with exim pre configured to be a relay.
[21:18:41] <SineDeviance> and replacing the webapp or printer or whatever, yeah, i get that. in some cases it's in the budget (small printers) and in some cases it's not (a $500,000-$1,000,000 software rewrite)

[21:22:56] <MadCamel> and no I wouldn't deploy a pi at client sites either haha. But I mean the choices suck. You can open them up to security issues by sending badly authenticated/encrypted mail over the internet. You can tell them to upgrade their otherwise perfectly functional printers and devices to support the latest TLS standards and so on. Or you can setup a local relay.

Anything you make beyond that reasonable amount can be taken as a distribution from the corp, bypassing both payroll and self employment tax :)
[21:49:54] <MadCamel> find a good accountant they'll walk you through it

[21:50:08] <SineDeviance> MadCamel: that is good in theory, but due to the way our clients pay us and how we bill out projects we don't know if we're going to do X revenue this month or Y revenue
[21:50:21] <Hash> Oh
[21:50:25] <Hash> it's highly variable?
[21:50:29] <SineDeviance> I have literally had months where I did under $1,500 or even $0 in revenue
[21:50:38] <SineDeviance> but then I have months where we do like $25,000 in revenue
[21:50:50] <Hash> Interesting.
[21:50:56] <SineDeviance> We have very little overhead so profit margin exceeds 90% most of the time
[21:51:18] <Hash> Business is like being able to sell people stuff.
[21:51:26] <SineDeviance> That is why payroll doesn't work for us, we don't know if we can afford it from one month to the next
[21:51:37] <Hash> I'm not so good at sales. Selling myself or a product.
[21:51:56] <MadCamel> Yep. It takes some planning but it's doable. Properly implemented you could be saving up to 10% on your taxes
[21:52:19] <SineDeviance> When I say we, I have two partners. I'm the majority, the other two account for 45%. It's just easier to do distribution of profit

[21:53:26] <SineDeviance> I did the math, it's cheaper to distribute
[21:53:55] <SineDeviance> The amount of money the company would spend to run payroll through an accountant would exceed what we pay extra in taxes
[21:54:00] <SineDeviance> this isn't even considering payroll taxes
[21:54:35] <SineDeviance> One day I will break down and do it, but I'm going to wait until the pandemic cools off a bit more and projects start to come back
[21:54:40] <MadCamel> no you don't run payroll through the accountant that's $$$. You just have one set you up with the proper tax structure and DIY the payroll for like $20/mo.

[21:56:44] <SineDeviance> do you know how I get around the "we might do $0 in revenue this month" problem? I only ask because I asked our tax preparer (who is also a CPA) about setting this up down the line and he told us we need to stabilize revenue before we do it.

[21:59:58] <MadCamel> yeah there are penalties for not filing payroll and paying the payroll taxes. YMMV but in my state I was told it's okay to have variable payroll. Didn't make money this month? Pay everyone $1. Just have to be able to show in an audit that everyone's being paid a fair wage and you're not just using it as a tax dodge. That's the key. Pay everyone fairly and *then* skim off the top with reduced taxes.
[22:00:25] <SineDeviance> Ahh
