[00:00:11] <aidalgol> Yes, I think it's supposed to be a shock.
[00:00:43] <technomancy> this character seems to be somewhat confused about how spines work
[00:01:45] <JordiGH> And apparently "stand up straight", not "stand straight"?
[00:01:58] <JordiGH> Not sure, "stand straight" doesn't sound so bad to me.
[00:02:14] <grym> either wording sounds fine to my ears 
[00:03:52] <JordiGH> aidalgol: The storytelling is also kind of bad, characters overreact with overdramatic animesque poses for relatively minor things. Mina constantly looks like she's trying to squat down and push out a fart whenenver she gets upset, and she gets upset a lot. Plus characters are introduced without any introduction and are never mentioned again.
[00:04:06] <aidalgol> You probably don't want to take game recommendations from me anymore.

[00:06:36] <aidalgol> But it doesn't wrap everything up in a neat little package.
[00:06:54] <johnjay> is it a heroic band of outlaws struggling against a tyrannical overbearing religion that is also in coop with the industry exploiting the resources?
[00:07:21] <johnjay> by the way replace 'religion' there by 'corporation' and you have the plot of FFVII

[00:20:18] <seabass> but I'd like to bind it only to the middle mouse button
[00:20:28] <seabass> and use left mouse button for opening in the same frame
[00:20:47] <natrys> for completing-read, if initial input produces only one candidate, is there a way to tell it to simply select that without further prompt?

[00:34:09] <bpalmer> seabass: what is your function definition? Can you put it on a paste site?
[00:34:21] <johnjay> shouldn't that be a lambda?

[00:35:42] <bpalmer> seabass: yes. That is just a quote variant.
[00:36:00] <seabass> If I'm not mistaken, #'() creates an anonymous function
[00:36:00] <johnjay> apparently defun uses lambda under the hood
[00:36:10] <johnjay> no lambda does
[00:36:19] <johnjay> #' is just a courtesy notation, means the same as quote
[00:36:24] <bpalmer> seabass: I recommend defining a function first and foremost with a name, like (defun seabass/open-in-window (evt) (interactive "e") ...)  and then (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "<mouse-2>") 'seabass/open-in-window)
[00:36:37] <seabass> johnjay: heh, that's really interesting. In Clojure, #' actually creates a function
[00:36:45] <bpalmer> naming things is not a problem ; names are cheap, and it simplifies so much
[00:36:46] <acdw> yeah (function (interactive) ...) aint right
[00:36:47] *** Joins: sxzzsf (~sxzzsf@user/sxzzsf)
[00:36:49] <johnjay> i think in common lisp the #' is optional right?
[00:36:54] <bpalmer> you can then do basic indentation, sharing , etc.
[00:37:16] <bpalmer> in both elisp and common lisp, (lambda () ...) does not require quoting (either ' or #')
[00:38:05] <bpalmer> People stress out about using lambdas or avoiding names way too much
[00:38:09] <acdw> if you expand lambda macro it includes the (function .. ) in there, which is what #' expands to reader macro thing
[00:38:15] <johnjay> right but in common lisp #' is synonymous with '

[01:06:33] <seabass> acdw: thank you very much for your patience
[01:06:41] <seabass> double makes my function work perfectly :)
[01:06:41] <acdw> okay so it looks like if you (setq mouse-1-click-follows-link t) before setting the thing, it'll work
[01:06:49] <acdw> oh or double, lol
[01:07:06] <seabass> yeah, double is exactly what I like, thanks :)
[01:07:23] <seabass> or I could set it to 't' only when I'm in dired
[01:07:26] <acdw> if you /only/ want it in dired mode, you could do (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook (lambda () (setq-local mouse-1-click-follows-link 'double)))
[01:07:33] <acdw> or w/e

[02:44:05] <minall> Hello Emacs Community!... I have a very repetitive task that I want to tackle using macros
[02:44:16] <bpalmer> keyboard macros?
[02:44:23] <minall> bpalmer: yep
[02:44:56] <minall> My situation is: I copy a mail from outside, on my clipboard. Then go to emacs and search it using C-s and C-r since is quite large
[02:45:35] <minall> And once found, C-a <SPACE> C-f and M-W to copy
[02:46:04] <minall> The problem is that the keyboard macros always fails on the part of C-s C-y to copy the value from outside
[02:46:12] <minall> So I'm not sure how should I debug this

[02:49:20] <minall> Oh, I just solve it, using another function for searching bpalmer!
[02:50:46] <minall> Oh, actually is not that exact
[02:50:50] <minall> Any other ideas?
[02:52:05] <bpalmer> minall: hmm. I'm not positive; I'd probably end up writing this in elisp
[02:54:09] <minall> bpalmer but how would I call it using keyboard macros?... Sorry I may be a noobie in this
[02:54:35] <bpalmer> just from what you're describing, I think this is due to a search "failing" which by default ends keyboard macros
[02:55:08] <bpalmer> minall: I may be able to play with it later, or somebody else may know keyboard macros better offhand
[02:55:52] <minall> bpalmer can I stop this behavior of the keyboard macro?..
[02:56:08] <minall> Or wait, I can just go to the beginning of the file?, that way I don't have to go back..

[04:09:50] <Spawns_Carpeting> is it possible to make tramp not try to run commands on the remote host, say if I run "eshell" while in a buffer opened with tramp
[04:10:03] <Spawns_Carpeting> I just want a regular eshell buffer below my tramp buffer
[04:10:13] <grym> my mom's folks are all from geneseo-ish 
[04:10:35] <bpalmer> Spawns_Carpeting: the simplest way is probably to make sure that you start eshell from somewhere else, possibly advising eshell or using a different function to start it
[04:11:02] <Spawns_Carpeting> I am running it from my own function, but it still causes it for some reason 
[04:11:16] <Spawns_Carpeting> its kind of clunky to have to switch buffers just to run eshell
[04:11:25] <bpalmer> Spawns_Carpeting: for example, (defun my-eshell () (interactive) (let ((default-directory (substitute-in-file-name "$HOME"))) (eshell)))

[04:14:14] <grym> bpalmer: metro area can get quite silly.  boston is ~620k +/- 100k if school's in session, but the metro area is ~4.7M -- but, depending on who you ask, "metro boston" can include the capital of another state.

[05:14:12] <homerj> everything is pretty flat, and I don't ride fast
[05:14:13] <parsnip> backpacks are way more symmetrically loaded than a messenger bag

[05:15:37] <parsnip> almost certainly
[05:15:48] <homerj> that was just the one you got in high school

[05:16:28] <johnjay> grym: i'm surprised i never knew it was called that
[05:16:41] <parsnip> the jansport had graffiti all over it, and the zipper was broken
[05:16:55] <johnjay> backpack crinkles everything though
[05:17:01] <johnjay> you need some kind of cardboard envelope or something
[05:17:03] <homerj> I ran mine over with a car
[05:17:14] <parsnip> a friend just shown me a pic of an eddie bauer backpack, which i think is similar in spirit to the ll bean backpack

[05:20:30] <parsnip> no way
[05:20:53] <homerj> yeah, PA changed the law a few years back, that you could drive a golf cart on streets, if it was less than a mile
[05:20:57] <bpalmer> in many states, you can get golf carts or the like that drive up to 25 mph without a driver's license
[05:21:02] <parsnip> what conditions brought you to consider that?
[05:21:19] <homerj> but then I looked into more, and the exemption was only for maintenance carts

[08:48:13] <aidalgol> I don't think it's trying to be Metroid, though.  It just has elements from that genre in it.

[11:05:34] <codingquark> Going with metadioxin, he estimates, will cost her about a 100 votes, but turns out she is winning by 91 votes anyway (polls w/e)
[11:05:36] <parsnip> he said he'd only lose 100 environmentalist votes
[11:05:44] <kimjetwav> It means her burrough is small enough she won with 50% + 91.
[11:05:59] <codingquark> That is the technical way to put it, thank you
[11:06:28] <parsnip> wait, have you both seen this episode in its entirety?
[11:07:12] <parsnip> i thought maybe she meant 91% of her region are environmentalists

[11:10:58] <kimjetwav> It's a good show, I should rewatch Yes Minister at some point. It currently occupies the same sort of space in my brain as The Simpsons: I periodically remember references to the episodes but couldn't tell you the plots of all of them.

[23:23:03] *** Joins: JordiGH (~jordi@user/jordigh)
[23:23:40] <bpalmer> artefact: no, the quoting i mean is (kbd "<XF86AudioMute>") needs to be evaluated ; so if you're doign something like (easy-define-map '(... ((kbd "<XF86AudioMute>) ... )) ...) that might not work, because the top-level ' is stopping evaluation
[23:24:05] <bpalmer> artefact: so you could present somewhere (possibly a pastebin) what the code is that you're using to set this, and maybe that will make it visible.
[23:24:46] <bpalmer> as it is, though, evaluate (kbd "<XF86AudioMute>") and you'll probably et something like [XF86AudioMute]   (that is , a vector that has one element, a symbol that matches the X-generated keysym)
[23:25:00] <bpalmer> so you could try just using that instead.
[23:29:48] <johnjay> bpalmer: yeah xorg still regards those as keysyms right
[23:29:49] <artefact> using M-x eval-expression (kbd ...) worked! thanks bpalmer
[23:29:56] <johnjay> they're totally unused though
