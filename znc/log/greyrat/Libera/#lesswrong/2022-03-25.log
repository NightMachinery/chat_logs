[01:02:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> For example: "instead of using any framework, write raw JavaScript yourself" is absolutely a key part of why gwern.net has so many "innovative" features, but pretty much everyone who could conceivably be the target audience for such a lesson will hear as something like "put your pants on your head, shift your station wagon into reverse, and drive backwards; this is the best way to get to China"
[01:03:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> ("innovative" in scare quotes because there's very little there that, like, I or gwern personally thought of for the first time in the history of computers; it's just that nobody else does it on the web)
[01:05:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Note that there are other people out there who have a "minimalist / bare metal" approach to websites; but, overwhelmingly, the things they make look much more like motherfuckingwebsite.com than like gwern.net)
[01:05:13] <gwern> (I think automatic inflation adjustments might be genuinely novel. I still have not run into any example of that in documents. everyone either provides what looks like manual inflation adjustments, or it's treat as another time-series ('X, but real terms'))
[01:06:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Oh yes, for sure. But from a web dev perspective, in both complexity / UX impact, they pale in comparison to e.g. sidenotes, popups, etc.
[01:07:04] <gwern> (eg. even economics websites will generally either not inflation adjust, or they'll inflation-adjust once to, I guess, whenever it was first written so you will get 2012$ adjustments or something wacky like that. or FRED will provide you plenty of inflation-adjusted time-series graphs and exports and everything, but they're treated as blackboxes, not as a display option which can be applied...
[01:07:10] <gwern> ...to literally every nominal amoiunt everywhere. so you'll get 'US GDP but real' or 'wheat exports, but real', and there won't be a 'real' toggle on the graphs)
[01:07:59] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: yeah. once you get into there, novelty is harder to ascertain. are we the first to do *recursive* popups? ...possibly?
[01:09:02] <gwern> I'm also not sure about the local-archiving functionality. people will insert additional archive links, or swap out links, but I don't think I've run into any sites as extreme as gwern.net in its archive-PDFs-on-sight-and-everything-else-later-as-the-default-link policy
[01:10:07] <gwern> I suspect I am the first there, because most people aren't sufficiently familiar with SingleFile-like tools to script it, and many are too scared of copyright to actually do it

[01:15:40] <dbohdan[phone]> Obormot\Arcturus: I agree with the incommunicability point. Your message about raw JavaScript wouldn't get through to either the median front end dev or the minimalist.
[01:17:08] <adiabatic> to do gwern.net things across multiple sites it'd be an undertaking, comparable to making a CSS+JS library
[01:17:21] <adiabatic> and probably harder because of assumptions of what gwern content is like
[01:17:23] <dbohdan[phone]> Obormot\Arcturus: What is your policy on recent CSS features and layout compatibility with old browsers, by the way? 
[01:18:39] <gwern> we generally target >95% marketshare
[01:18:41] *** Quits: bucketevolve (~neon@p3e9e676a.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[01:19:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> dbohdan[phone]: That sort of thing I generally defer to whoever is actually the site owner and thus whose audience it is (and who knows the audience). So e.g. gwern's take tends to be "if they're using IE 6 then that's their fault", and that's reasonable enough as far as I'm concerned, so yeah, as gwern said
[01:19:16] <gwern> if it break on <5% and we need it, oh well. upgrade your browser. if it's on <95%, then it'd better either degrade well or we have to have a workaround
[01:20:06] <gwern> so eg lazy-loading images. safari still doesn't do it, so it's stuck at like 75% market share. however, that just means safari users waste bandwidth downloading, and are no worse off than before when sans-lazy, everyone was downloading all the images. oh well. go complain to apple.
[01:20:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> dbohdan[phone]: Certainly I don't endorse using bleeding edge stuff, if that's what you mean by "recent", but e.g. I won't avoid grid just because IE 9 or 10 or w/e doesn't support it
[01:20:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or yeah that
[01:21:39] <gwern> 95% is kinda arbitrary, but it's also fairly natural in that when you start talking about how to get to 97%, or 99%, then you start being handicapped by 'this chinese fork of firefox from 2009' or 'embedded devices running IE6 which will never be upgraded'
[01:22:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, or exotic stuff like qutebrowser, Waterfox, and so on
[01:22:15] <gwern> if you wait on 99% or 100% (according to caniuse), you're going to wait forever
[01:22:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, there's value in making sure that users of such things get the content, in *basically* a readable state
[01:23:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> And/or making sure that if browser X can't do it, then nevertheless any system that runs X can also run Y which can do it... that sort of thing... 
[01:23:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Heuristically speaking, anyhow)
[01:23:33] <gwern> I also tend to think such users are used to it. if you're running something weird-ass like waterfox, well, you've probably gotten used to a lot of stuff being broken by default...
[01:24:32] <dbohdan[phone]> Thanks! My website targets IE11 right now (except for some lazy-loading images). I'll probably switch to a 9x% market share policy for the next version. It seems a very reasonable way to do it.
[01:25:21] <gwern> https://www.gwern.net/docs/www/misc/xwd-16481552653568954.png heck, even elinks still works pretty well on gwern.net

[01:25:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah... a while ago I got a complaint from someone that AKS was broken on Waterfox. I looked into it. It gave some inscrutable error; when I pursued it, I just couldn't find any info about it, at all. So I emailed the complainer back like "if you can get the Waterfox devs to explain wtf is going on here, at least, I'll try to fix it; but as it stands, I have literally no idea what to do about this and no way to find out"
[01:26:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Never heard from the guy again
[01:26:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> So I guess it's still broken and will never be fixed. What can I do? Nothing
[01:26:41] <gwern> it was probably waterfox-specific bullshit anyway
[01:27:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sure, but I was willing to at least try to include a workaround or some such. But if I don't know anything about why it breaks, how can I? There's got to be a support community that makes some effort to work with developers in cases like this
[01:27:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or else the users are just SOL
[01:28:06] <dbohdan[phone]> As a user of Opera before it became Chrome I got used to things breaking. I didn't expect everything to work by default, though for a time in the '00s almost everything did.

[01:32:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hm, does FF still not support this
[01:33:23] <gwern> lazy loading? no, it does, since early 2020. chrome beat it by a few months in a shipped version
[01:33:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's not working though

[05:25:28] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Four posts have been removed by AEO since the last report. More ominously, we received a direct message from an admin for the first time. While not explicitly threatening us with action, the tone was very much "Hey, we've noticed an uptick in sitewide rules violations in your sub, you should really keep on top of that..." Given that the aforementioned four posts recently
[05:25:28] <feepbot> removed had not been modded by us because in our opinion, they violated neither the sub's rules nor reddit's, we are... concerned. We have taken the admin up on their invitation to ask questions. We are seeking clarification. One of the things hinted at, and which we fear may be the case, is that when we do mod a post for breaking (reddit's) rules, it will no longer be sufficient
[05:25:28] <feepbot> to issue a greenhat warning or ban, but we will also have to remove the post. Based on previous experience and the experience of other subs, I cannot say we are optimistic. Bluntly, we believe that certain topics and viewpoints are anathema to the survival of a sub even though reddit won't explicitly declare them forbidden or spell out the terms under which they may be discussed.
[05:25:33] <feepbot> So that leaves us in a bind, as our options seem to be: Concede, and announce that certain debates are just too radioactive and are no longer permissible here. Continue to moderate as we have been, and accept that the doomsday clock for this sub is ticking closer to midnight.

[09:58:53] <quanticle> "Based con what???" 
[09:59:13] <adiabatic> some SF con by people who don't like the people who hand out Hugos these days.
[09:59:49] <quanticle> And only 40 people showed up? Oof.
[10:00:09] <adiabatic> my immediate reaction was "intimate! Sounds like a genuinely fun time!"
[10:00:54] <quanticle> Well, okay, before I judge, how long was this con?
[10:01:33] <adiabatic> the upcoming one will be from 9/9 to 9/11
[10:03:36] <quanticle> Hmmm... a weekend? Eh. A day with 40 random strangers united by a common interest and no fixed agenda sounds okay-ish. An entire weekend? Sounds boring.
[10:04:20] <nshepperd2> the common interest being bitterness about  the hugos doesn't intuitively sound like a recipe for a great time though
[10:04:30] <quanticle> Also, TIL that C-u C-y in emacs pastes without moving the cursor
[10:04:47] <quanticle> Didn't know you could pass a prefix argument to yank like that
[10:05:08] <adiabatic> interesting, I kill all the time in macOS but never yank
[10:05:23] <adiabatic> and it uses a separate buffer from the clipboard
[10:05:51] <quanticle> In Linux, when you copy or kill, it just goes to the system clipboard.
[10:06:04] <adiabatic> in BBEdit, whether you copy or kill, it goes to the system clipboard.
[10:06:30] <adiabatic> I use C-k to delete to the end of the cursor. A lot. I get mad when C-k gets yanked (sorry) for some other purpose, like link making.
[10:07:42] <quanticle> I wish I had the confidence to C-k like that
[10:08:04] <adiabatic> why don't you?

[11:04:14] <feep[work]> hot take
[11:04:20] <feep[work]> worm is actually a very bad universe for fanfic.
[11:04:34] <quanticle> Is this a hot take?
[11:04:40] <quanticle> I don't have my take thermometer.
[11:04:43] <feep[work]> well it is a hot take if you ask fanfic writers
[11:05:04] <quanticle> Yes, but as a fanfic reader, all the Worm fanfics I've read have been terrible.
[11:05:09] <feep[work]> eh
[11:05:19] <feep[work]> yes, but I'm looking at it from a sociological perspective
[11:05:22] <quanticle> In my opinion, Madoka is a better universe for fanfic than Worm.
[11:05:24] <feep[work]> like, "what makes a good fanfic universe"
[11:05:32] <feep[work]> madoka is also good!
[11:05:47] <feep[work]> and actually, I can sum up the problems with worm by comparing them
[11:06:20] <feep[work]> so ... imagine if kyubey was manipulating the entire world because he was actually serving, or preparing to fight, walpurgisnacht, which is going to destroy the entire multiverse.
[11:06:41] <PapuaHardyNet> who is walpurgisnacht btw?
[11:06:46] <feep[work]> scion
[11:06:48] <feep[work]> in this analogy
[11:07:49] <quanticle> Madoka                           Worm
[11:07:51] <quanticle> -------------------------------+------------------------------------
[11:07:52] <feep[work]> and, I've previously said, a good property of a fanfic universe is that the plot is easily solved.
[11:07:53] <quanticle> Lots of fluffy lesbian romance | Insufficient fluffy lesbian romance
[11:08:02] <dbohdan[phone]> quanticle: Thanks! It wasn't my favorite sample, because I didn't have a proper surface to write on. In better samples my letters are more consistently round and long-tailed.
[11:08:07] <feep[work]> that sounds contradictory, but, consider harry potter
[11:08:22] <PapuaHardyNet> I agree with quant, if worm had fluffy lesbian romance I would have considered reading it (also if it was 99% shorter)
[11:08:23] <feep[work]> solving voldemort took the combined efforts and year-long investment of ... three kids and a teacher.
[11:08:48] <feep[work]> like, there are ways you as a self-insert or even just arbitrary character can contribute to solving voldemort!
[11:09:01] <feep[work]> voldemort is not like a mega-god that is also the source of all magic
[11:09:11] <feep[work]> and also reflexively counters avada kedavra
[11:09:24] <PapuaHardyNet> so, the converse is a universe where plots are almost impossible to solve. Like W40K?
[11:09:43] <feep[work]> well, 40k is also ... well, 40k is good in that it has scale
[11:09:59] <feep[work]> like, you can si in 40k as a galaxy destroying superplague and not be obviously unbalanced
[11:10:02] <quanticle> Oh, so what you're saying is that the most fertile ground for fanfics is, "What do the characters do after the main villain has been defeated," and in the case of Worm, there really isn't very much left for them to do.
[11:10:09] <feep[work]> no!
[11:10:15] <feep[work]> the problem with worm is that it follows taylor
[11:10:35] <feep[work]> and taylor is street level, as are most heroes in that webfic, but also *happens to be* the puzzle solution to the puzzle boss
[11:10:47] <feep[work]> who happens to be thematically resonant with her story
[11:11:10] <dbohdan[phone]> feep[work]: I've heard the take that _Worm_ is a bad universe for fanfic because the world is too heavily affected by the plot. You can't really have side stories that ignore the main story without changing the main story.
[11:11:13] <quanticle> So making anyone else the protagonist kind of doesn't work?
[11:11:25] <PapuaHardyNet> okay I get it!
[11:11:28] <feep[work]> as a result, if you want to at all interact with the canon plotline, you either need a power that is god-tier scalable or you need to railroad the ending
[11:11:36] <PapuaHardyNet> you mean the more intertwined the story is, the harder it is to fanfic
[11:11:48] <feep[work]> the more *necessary* the solution is, I would say.
[11:12:06] <feep[work]> nobody fanfics into existing detective stories.
[11:12:24] <quanticle> Isn't there quite a lot of Sherlock Holmes fanfic?
[11:12:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: I think it's much more sensible to frame this in RPG terms, observe:
[11:12:43] <feep[work]> yes, but there's not much *sherlock holmes and custom character X solve a canon case* fanfic, to my understanding
[11:12:44] <quanticle> Especially after the new series with Benedict Cucumberpatch?
[11:12:52] <quanticle> Ah, okay

[11:13:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: Fertile fanfic settings are sandboxes; infertile ones are story-centered
[11:13:32] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: I think that's too easy... well, it's a question of how to design a good sandbox
[11:13:41] <feep[work]> minecraft is not a fertile sandbox setting because it has *no* structure
[11:13:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Correct
[11:14:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Working backwards, though, one *sign of* of a good sandbox is that the action of the canon is episodic
[11:14:13] <feep[work]> so I think I'd say fertile settings are sandboxes with a story with good amounts of slack.
[11:14:39] <feep[work]> this is a problem with skyrim as a setting
[11:14:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is why most space opera TV series make such outstanding fanfic grounds
[11:14:47] <feep[work]> because the main story *requires* a dragonborn
[11:15:01] <feep[work]> you cannot solve alduin with magic or by werewolfing at him really hard
[11:15:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like Star Trek or Star Wars or SG1
[11:15:10] <feep[work]> yeah!
[11:15:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's just so much stuff
[11:15:23] <feep[work]> right and also the setting doesn't *need* solving.
[11:15:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Right
[11:15:28] <feep[work]> it can take solving!
[11:15:35] <PapuaHardyNet> you need *some* structure, but not too much then? there are no minecraft fanfics but there are skyrim fanfics.
[11:15:42] <feep[work]> but you're not on a hard predetermined timer for a massive damage gate.
[11:15:47] <PapuaHardyNet> (no please, please don't link me minecraft fanfics)
[11:15:55] <feep[work]> they do exist
[11:15:57] <feep[work]> but they tend to die
[11:15:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: Another telltale sign: lots of tie-in content
[11:16:03] <feep[work]> for the opposite reason that wormfics tend to die
[11:16:03] <dbohdan[phone]> Does _Touhou_ have just enough structure? It is one of the most popular things for fanworks.
[11:16:12] <feep[work]> touhou is very episodic!
[11:16:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Novels, TTRPGs, etc.
[11:16:20] <dbohdan[phone]> Right
[11:16:29] <feep[work]> touhou also doesn't need to be solved on a hard timer, and it has lots of slac
[11:16:32] <feep[work]> k
[11:16:33] <quanticle> Yeah, each touhou game is basically a sandalone storyline
[11:16:36] <feep[work]> I'd say its power system is a bit too unconstrained
[11:16:38] <quanticle> *standalone
[11:16:59] <feep[work]> I think it's *good* for fanfic to have like ... a determined goal
[11:17:09] <feep[work]> like alduin, or scion, or the emperor in star wars
[11:17:12] <quanticle> I have no idea what the touhou power system is, all I know is that, at the end, you have a bunch of cute anime girls who are all laughing at each other and it's very cute.
[11:17:42] <feep[work]> actually, star wars is great for this because you can scale your victory condition to the level of conflict you want
[11:17:58] <feep[work]> unless you decide to set your fic on aldebaran, you're not on a timer. "escape the jedi purge" is a totally valid goal

[11:21:42] <feep[work]> so you're either locked into having a metapower that can scale to *god* and his *deathbeam that kills you instantly*
[11:21:48] <feep[work]> or you're locked to your fic dying a quiet death.
[11:22:15] <PapuaHardyNet> imagine a firefox extension that connects to a neural network that takes a link, gets the fulltext of that link, and then classifies the content based on how useful you would find it. everytime you close a tab, if the network is uncertain, it asks for a rating. when you open a tab the network believes is unimpactful, it will warn you beforehand.
[11:22:23] <feep[work]> usually right after the slaughterhouse nine, because killing the slaughterhouse nine is the upper limit of a credible street-level power.
[11:22:36] <PapuaHardyNet> an MVP is to simply use a classifier that takes the URL of the web page as the input, which is already a huge source of information
[11:22:53] <PapuaHardyNet> basically bayesian spam filter but for web pages
[11:22:56] <quanticle> When fundamentalist Christians look to the Bible as a source for moral guidance, I can respect that. They're looking to the Bible as a source for moral guidance because their belief system states that the Bible is the source of all truth. When moderate Christians (who accept the primacy of science and rational thought in all other fields) look to the Bible for moral guidance, I'm like, ????
[11:23:49] <quanticle> By what basis do you believe that the Bible is more correct about morality than it is about the world being created in literally seven days?

[11:25:11] <feep[work]> so in worm, I think on reengineering a "good" power from what I remember of how child of monsters went, I think the way to go is to grab a power that gives you *multiple upgrade paths*.
[11:25:16] <feep[work]> so you can scale with exponents.
[11:25:43] <quanticle> PapuaHardyNet: I can see that going very wrong, very quickly. Imagine that network warning you every time you open a scientific paper, because you happened to train it on a day where you were procrastinating and browsing memes
[11:26:06] <feep[work]> ie. something that gives you time to think plus something that scales off attention, for instance, is two dimensions of upgrading for the price of one
[11:26:31] <feep[work]> or I mean, you can go the puzzle route and bully scion to death, but you'll still need some way to tank at least glancing stilling hits
[11:26:41] <quanticle> PapuaHardyNet: In general, I am very wary of any system that allows past-quanticle to have too much control over present-quanticle.
[11:26:51] <quanticle> past-quanticle was a moron!
[11:27:04] <PapuaHardyNet> huh
[11:27:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Agreed
[11:27:45] <feep[work]> and especially if you're running as a quest, you also will do better if you have some way to pull upgrades out of your arse if needed
[11:28:05] <feep[work]> ie. perks that you can vary depending on need
[11:28:10] <feep[work]> another way to get multi-exponential scaling
[11:28:25] <feep[work]> again, cough child of monsters cough
[11:29:38] <feep[work]> (this is also why tinkers suck: two upgrade paths at most.)
[11:29:40] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: I can't tell if you're agreeing with my general point or if you're agreeing with my specific assertion that past-quanticle was a moron. If it's the latter then, fuck you bro, only present-quanticle gets to call past-quanticle a moron!
[11:29:45] *** Joins: a1eaiact1 (~a1eaiacta@user/a1eaiactaest)
[11:30:19] <quanticle> Future-quanticle can fuck off too!
[11:30:39] <quanticle> (He says, noting that's it's like 2am and he hasn't gone to bed yet)
[11:30:46] <feep[work]> well, hm. actually let me be clearer. the problem with tinkers is that they can't explode suddenly in power. I think a good worm build needs to have linear scaling in the first half and hard exponential in the second
[11:31:16] <quanticle> Warrior in front, mage in back, to paraphrase the expression about mullets
[11:32:23] <feep[work]> you have maybe ten chapters or twenty of content between killing jack slash, a man with a knife and the power to be really convincing, and like ... what's there above that? slaughterhouse 9k, I guess, you can run bakuda but that's a mission whose only purpose is to show off that you're stronger now, and then it's all heavy hitters like glaistig uaine, contessa, etc
[11:33:08] <feep[work]> all the stuff in power *inbetween* those two is strictly optional, like nilbog
[11:33:50] <feep[work]> and of course the reason for all this is that skitter ... *scales*, sure, but only to mid level, past that point it's all guile hero, even with her eleventh hour powerup-pulled-from-arse
[11:34:44] <feep[work]> so you kind of have to throw out the whole second half of the plot and make your own enemies that are powerful enough to be scary but with specific enough weaknesses that your power can take them
[11:35:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: lol. I meant the thing about the Christians
[11:35:34] <feep[work]> and that's the cliff.
[11:36:03] <quanticle> That's what I never understood about the last-minute powerup. Why would Scion, the avatar of a profoundly alien multi-dimensional worm-like entity, have anything close to human thoughts or human psychology?
[11:36:13] <feep[work]> oh that part makes sense.
[11:36:26] <feep[work]> scion doesn't, but his avatar does, and scion is basically comatose
[11:36:38] <feep[work]> his only motivational inputs come from human-scion's simulated brain.
[11:36:47] <quanticle> So how does killing the avatar kill the worm?
[11:37:16] <feep[work]> it doesn't
[11:37:19] <feep[work]> which is why they didn't do that
[11:37:53] <feep[work]> the point is to use the avatar, the *only* emotive, motivational input that scion-actual has, to overload scion-actual until he wants, prefers to die.
[11:38:05] <quanticle> Oh, I see.
[11:38:34] <quanticle> Wow, does this mean that Taylor kills Scion with *frame-control*?
[11:38:37] <feep[work]> yes.
[11:38:47] <PapuaHardyNet> Taylor, the original red-piller
[11:38:48] <quanticle> Cancel Taylor Herbert!
[11:38:48] <feep[work]> well, the joke is that taylor kills scion with relentless bullying
[11:39:02] <PapuaHardyNet> (wouldn't you want to be relentlessly bullied by taylor)
[11:39:09] <feep[work]> no, are you kidding me? fuck no
[11:39:38] <feep[work]> you'd want to be bullied by someone who knows limtis.
[11:39:39] <feep[work]> limits.*
[11:39:41] <quanticle> She can control spiders; the only person here who could tolerate being relentlessly bulllied by Taylor Herbert is Obormot\Arcturus.
[11:40:07] <feep[work]> look, when taylor wanted to relentlessly bully someone, she surrounded them by inescapable pictures of their dead wife's corpse.
[11:40:17] <feep[work]> there is nothing sexy about that.
[11:40:24] <quanticle> She also shoved spiders up someone's nose
[11:40:29] <feep[work]> well that was self-defense, not bullying
[11:41:07] <feep[work]> so was scion to be fair, she just decided that bullying was the most expedient way to self-defense god to death.
[11:41:37] <feep[work]> in a way, seeing taylor be small-scale innocently petty to someone would actually be a very good sign for her psyche.
[11:42:01] <feep[work]> I'd almost be too happy to be annoyed
[11:43:41] <feep[work]> taylor doesn't step on you, taylor steps over you on her way to a better vantage point for her control radius
[11:44:07] <quanticle> PapuaHardyNet: You know, if you really think about it, _Robinson Crusoe_ is a minecraft fanfic
[11:44:16] <PapuaHardyNet> I know right?
[11:44:22] <feep[work]> quanticle: the mysterious island
[11:44:26] <PapuaHardyNet> feep[work]: she's perfect!
[11:44:36] <feep[work]> PapuaHardyNet: I mean, she is, just not as a dom.
[11:44:59] <PapuaHardyNet> well, yes, but as a broken bird a foolish man can think he can fix
[11:45:23] <feep[work]> yeah that sort of fanfic can work, but that's what I mean ... you leave the main plot basically in place
[11:47:26] <PapuaHardyNet> "That is a fancy phrase for ‘answering a bunch of trivia questions quickly with your best probability, and seeing what you get wrong, until you know what “50% certainty” feels like or what “10% certainty” feels like, and then going back to real questions with those memories in mind’." reminds me of spaced repetition https://www.gwern.net/Fake-Journal-Club
[11:47:27] <Robomot> Fake Journal Club: Teaching Critical Reading · Gwern.net (Discussion of how to teach active reading and questioning of scientific research. Partially fake research papers may teach a critical attitude. Various ideas for games reviewed.)
[11:47:50] <quanticle> I was just thinking about conflict archetypes, and I realized that in fanfic, I see a lot of Man against Man, a fair amount of Man against Self and Man against Society, but not very much Man against Nature. And, Minecraft would be the perfect setting for Man against Nature.
[11:48:27] <quanticle> You'd have to write in the style of Jack London
[11:48:45] <quanticle> Or Daniel Defoe
[11:49:01] <quanticle> Or maybe Ernest Hemingway
[11:49:05] <feep[work]> eh, not sure there's enough depth there
[11:49:22] <quanticle> Maybe not, but it wouldn't have to be a novel
[11:49:49] <feep[work]> I think minecraft is ... really overtly a computer game.
[11:50:03] <feep[work]> there is a case to be made that it is a story that can only be told in game form.
[11:50:06] <quanticle> Yeah, if you play it straight, you just have a normal adventure story
[11:50:19] <quanticle> Like, dude gets stuck in a cave and finds his way out
[11:50:25] <feep[work]> I mean because its artificialness is part of its narrative.
[11:50:28] <quanticle> Yeah
[11:50:59] <feep[work]> like, look at its xp bar
[11:51:15] <feep[work]> in an rpg, level gain would be ... some synonym for you gaining skills or your body growing stronger or something
[11:51:29] <feep[work]> in minecraft, you gather xp, which is a resource that comes from dead bodies and that can be spent
[11:51:35] <feep[work]> what does xp mean? nothing.
[11:51:45] <feep[work]> it's just a number that accrues.
[11:51:57] <feep[work]> it means nothing for your character.
[11:52:39] <quanticle> Not really. You can spend XP to infuse tools, weapons and armor with magic. In that sense, XP in Minecraft works like the stormlight crystals from Sanderson's Stormlight Archive series. 
[11:52:55] <feep[work]> well right, it *works like* that, but it *isn't* anything
[11:53:08] <feep[work]> is xp a representation of you gaining experience? no! it's little glowy balls!
[11:53:17] <quanticle> Oh, yeah, canonically it's not really explained. It's just something that drops.
[11:53:48] <feep[work]> that's what I mean, minecraft as a game isn't a *representation* of reality, it's a facsimile of reality, and that's part of its structure.
[11:54:22] <feep[work]> like how there's a level called the end
[11:54:25] <feep[work]> and there is the ender dragon
[11:54:28] <feep[work]> and when you beat him the game ends
[11:54:30] <feep[work]> like
[11:54:42] <feep[work]> and all of this is because fans asked for an ending
[11:54:57] <feep[work]> like, that's narrative, but it's not the sort of narrative that can be textualized.

[12:00:20] <quanticle> Yeah, it's pure setting
[12:00:22] <quanticle> No plot
[12:00:34] <feep[work]> well, no legible plot.
[12:00:44] <feep[work]> it has an arc, it has setbacks, it has plot *structure*
[12:00:56] <quanticle> The plot is emergent out of the interactions between you and the game world
[12:01:02] <feep[work]> right! and it's crafted towards that end
[12:01:08] <quanticle> Or rather, you, your friends and the game world
[12:01:18] <feep[work]> the whole game is designed to enable plots to grow
[12:01:23] <quanticle> (Suck it Eliezer, I used "emergent" correctly)
[12:01:38] <feep[work]> that's why I said that "the minecraft plot" can only exist in a game
[12:02:15] <feep[work]> are videogames art? minecraft is imo one of those games that is art *as a videogame*
[12:02:17] <quanticle> Yeah. Kind of like how Dwarf Fortress "fanfics" are literally just people writing down the shit that happened to their fortress over the course of a playthrough.

How much of a no-no is accepting it? (OTOH, I am also wondering that maybe I'm playing the wrong game, and if I am to change companies, it shouldn't be for salaries pegged to my Eastern European 
[21:25:32] <workerdrone> country... just conflicted all around)
[21:26:54] <gwern> I wouldn't say it's a no-no at all. if your company wants to keep you, they can offer 40% more too
[21:27:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Agreed, why would it be a no-no
[21:27:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> But if you like your current company, perhaps go to the boss and ask for a matching raise
[21:27:36] <gwern> if you feel bad about it, accept the new job and then send a donation of 40% of your salary to the old company as an apology
[21:27:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> lol

[23:50:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> But it's def. sun / moon / black & white cookie
[23:50:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Very suspicious!
[23:50:36] <saturn2> don't people get mad when auto mode because they forgot they set their preference to dark?
[23:50:55] <gwern> hm. sun/moon/cookie isn't super obscure. that's why we picked them. and the three-state is just the correct thing to do.
[23:51:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: "just", you say, but this is *literally the second time I have seen anyone anywhere do this*
[23:51:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> (first being when we did it)
[23:51:42] <gwern> sus
[23:51:53] <gwern> keep an eye out for more gwern.netisms I guess
[23:51:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Guess so
[23:52:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: And yes people do get made. There's a comment somewhere in our JS to the effect that if they get mad then TOO BAD
[23:52:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> *get mad
[23:53:53] <gwern> to be fair, I haven't read any complaints about the auto in a long time
[23:54:03] <gwern> I think maybe users have gotten educated?
[23:54:08] <Obormot\Gaia> Maybe!
[23:54:36] <ggreer> people get mad at auto mode because some phones change the color scheme based on time of day or ambient light

[23:55:27] <gwern> yes. my point is I think that the complaints may have simply been transition costs as dark mode and auto mode were brand new, and now a year or two later, people now understand the idea, having lived with it so long and it been enabled in more things
