[12:20:56] <gahr> hi, today I was getting <<relay="127.0.0.1" delay=11s result="TempFail" stat="Network error on destination MXs">> errors on all output emails again. Bouncing smtpd an scheduling the queue made all deliveries succeed
[12:21:04] <gahr> I'm out of ideas as what might be causing this
[12:21:27] <gahr> s/output/outbound/
[12:43:14] <jrmu> for me that is often due to a misconfigured conf
[12:43:24] <jrmu> have you tried running smtpd in debug mode to look for any errors?
[12:44:19] <gahr> this starts happening once in a while out of the blue, and a service bounce makes it go away
[12:45:04] <gahr> I can try and see what happens in debug mode
[12:45:19] <jrmu> turning on debug plus increasnig verbosity often helps me
[12:45:26] <gahr> I have set smtpctl log verbose
[12:45:50] <gahr> how do you run in debug mode?
[12:48:06] <jrmu> $ doas smtpd -dvvv
[12:55:40] <gahr> no way for having smtpd go into the background and log that into the log file?
[12:56:06] <gahr> when running with -dvvv?
[12:56:21] <gahr> oh, sorry, I can do -vvv alone
[12:56:23] <gahr> I guess
[12:57:31] <gahr> mh, no, vvv alone doesn't seem to produce verbose output in the log file
[12:59:15] <jrmu> oh, I normally stop the daemon then start it up with -dvvv
[12:59:25] <jrmu> it might be possible to do that without restarting but I don't know how, maybe the man page has details

[13:43:54] <gahr> restarting is fine, I just would prefer to run smtpd from my init system than keeping a terminal open for i :)
[13:46:27] <jrmu> any unusual errors?
[13:54:00] <gahr> mh
[13:54:00] <gahr> Dec  9 16:42:38 mail smtpd[85447]: 88e07c70f35464aa mta connecting address=smtp://127.0.0.1:10027 host=localhost

[13:54:13] <gahr> that's unusual :)
[13:55:14] <gahr> 10027 is dkim_proxy
[14:06:26] <jrmu> gahr: is dkim proxy running?
[14:06:32] <jrmu> if it's not running, that would be the cause
[14:08:11] <gahr> it is running
[14:08:22] <gahr> the error went away by bouncing smtpd
[14:08:35] <gahr> perhaps a transient error that smtpd can't recover from?
[14:08:52] <gahr> I should move away from dkimproxy and user rspamd as a signer perhaps

[14:16:29] <jrmu> gahr: so I used this https://wiki.ircnow.org/?n=Opensmtpd.configure
[14:16:45] <jrmu> not sure if it has any errors but I'm using opensmtpd-filter-dkimsign

[15:00:15] <gahr> thanks will take a look
[15:30:55] <renaud> gahr: also, ensure that dkim_proxy is running on the right port
[15:31:42] <gahr> thanks, but that starts happening out of the blue, and bouncing smtpd fixes the issue.. it's not like I'm changing service ports randomly :)
[15:31:54] <renaud> there is also opensmtpd-filter-dkimsign which is simpler to configure and with way less dependencies
[15:31:56] <gahr> anyway, I have switched to opensmtpd-filter-rspamd now.. let's see how it goes :)
[15:32:52] <renaud> rspamd is nice, but I never got it to dkim sign my outgoing mails. but I am using dovecot as a subscription server with a forward to smtpd
[15:33:09] <gahr> it worked out of the box for me :)
[15:33:24] <renaud> if you auth with opensmtpd, probably
[15:33:58] <gahr> what do you mean by that?
