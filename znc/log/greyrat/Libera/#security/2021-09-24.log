[21:39:11] <Hash> For example, mem_cmp() (to compare checksums to ensure only authorized code is loaded) might return non boolean value

[21:39:24] <euouae> Hash doesn't that require physical access?
[21:39:30] <Hash> But you mess with the cpu to

[21:39:45] <Hash> But perhaps returns no_comparison or _nochange

[21:46:15] <Hash> where I think key and both IV are derived from your master firefox pw
[21:46:28] <Hash> euouae: ^&
[21:46:39] <MadCamel> it's not secure without a master password. You just have to hope nobody snarfs the database from your disk. Use a master password.
[21:46:44] <Hash> By default, the master password is the empty string. The password's entropy is bounded to 160 bits by sha1, which is further bounded to 112 bits by 3DES.
[21:46:56] <euouae> MadCamel OK thank you -- basically what I said above!
[21:47:09] <Hash> The encryption of items (usernames and passwords) is done using 3DES-CBC, with an IV included in the metadata of each item.
[21:47:26] <Hash> Unless the IVs are poorly generated, the small amount of data encrypted means that the best attack on 3DES is brute-forcing the master key or the user's password.
[21:47:36] <euouae> I.e. before Hash mentioned that FF encrypts them; I said by default it's unencrypted. Of course they're encrypted but the method is not secure, so effectively unencrypted (by default)

[22:47:02] <Hydragyrum> that doesn't mean those guidelines aren't meaningful
[22:47:08] <Hash> Freenode was the previous name. Name was hijacked, not freenode's spirit. That moved into a different body called Libera.chat
[22:47:24] <Hydragyrum> just because they aren't the enforced rules here doesn't make them irrelevant
[22:47:25] <Hash> So the catalyst guidelines very much apply
[22:47:38] <ajak> ah, sure

[23:22:18] <Hash> are you on the sane network setgment/subnet etc
[23:22:31] <Hash> Why should you have access to any ARP tables beyond your own segment?
[23:22:35] <Hash> That's the real question. :)
[23:23:10] <Hash> I mean, if you can find out the ARP tables of various network segments you're not a part of, that's a huge security issue
[23:23:18] <Hash> Like a fundamental and big huge issue.

[23:24:19] <Hash> You're talking over layer 3 for routing, and that doesn't know about MAC addresses (hardware physical addresses)
[23:24:27] <Hash> Layer 3 only knows about logical addresses
[23:25:20] <Hash> If you're on your local lan segment, then no need to do anything special, you will get MAC addresses

[23:26:58] <Hash> I forgot to highlight
[23:27:00] <Hash> My mistake
[23:27:09] <aac> yes,im connected to vpn
[23:27:26] <Hash> VPN happens over and beyond layer 3
[23:27:56] <Hash> So you have no idea about MAC addresses. Your NIC doesn't care about MAC address if you're not on the same segment
[23:28:16] <Hash> At layer 3 you have no idea. I don't mean like you have no idea in general lol
[23:28:25] <aac> hehe ok
[23:28:26] <aac> :)
[23:29:24] <Hash> Now, if you run nmap remotely over ssh and scan a local subnet or segment, you'd get MAC Address
[23:29:35] <Hash> local to that remote. not local to you

[23:50:11] <Hydragyrum> shouldn't need nmap to get arp tables from a machine you have access to -- arp(8), for instance, allows inspection of the arp table as a regular user
[23:52:34] *** Joins: pyrrhus (~pyrrhus@user/pyrrhus)
[23:54:25] <Hash> Well, using nmap on local segment, MAC is provided as default if using as root
[23:54:56] <Hash> It would be a hassle if nmap didn't provide it, and you did a local scan using nmap and still have to use arp to dump the table and correlate stuff
