[01:06:47] <xnaas> I know it's on-topic-ish
[01:06:47] <xnaas> but
[01:06:49] <xnaas> ya know
[01:06:52] <xnaas> people's personal shit
[01:06:52] <xnaas> anyway
[01:06:58] <xnaas> he was semi-active on my irc network
[01:07:13] <xnaas> whenever he came back after a few months, he'd just talk about matrix
[01:07:26] <xnaas> pretty sure his TL fork is dead and he's not interested in IRC any more
[01:07:32] <xnaas> could grep and share a bunch of logs, but meh
[01:07:37] <bookworm> code can't be dead if it is still working
[01:08:31] <xnaas> dead as in "won't be worked on ever again" :P
[01:08:51] <MaxLeiter> ^
[01:08:57] <MaxLeiter> thats what i meant in on topic
[01:09:03] <bookworm> luckily that just needs someone motivated isn't it?
[01:09:39] * xnaas wonders what motivation feels like
[01:09:40] <xnaas> :P
[01:09:58] <MaxLeiter> as someone about to graduate school, i agree 
[02:52:17] <xnaas> <+MaxLeiter> [...] would just need to wire up a default private mode user
[02:52:17] <xnaas> I like the idea of several people using the same account at once and being very confused. :D
[02:52:30] <xnaas> "Wait...I didn't send that??"
