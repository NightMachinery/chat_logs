[01:07:52] <nolyc> Undefined behavior results when programs attempt to do things for which the standard defines no semantics, and requires no diagnostic either. Examples include dereferencing invalid pointers and dividing by zero. Such a program allows the compiler and the resulting program to do anything, including going on as if nothing happened, formatting your hard drive, or making little demons fly out of your nose.

[03:21:26] <Alipha> jackkk: if i have an elevator that says it has a max capacity of 2500 pounds, and i put 3000 pounds in the elevator, what happens?
[03:23:20] <poprocks> interesting, I now see constant member functions in Stroustroup, 3rd ed. I guess I thought making the ret type `const char *` made that obvious, but if I'm understanding correctly, sticking the const at the *end* indicates that the method won't modify the state of the *class*
[03:25:00] <Alipha> poprocks: correct. with your code as it is, if you did `const Person; printf("%s\n", pers.get_name());` then you would get a compile error because pers is const but get_name is not const
[03:25:23] <poprocks> ahh, okay.
[03:26:00] <Alipha> poprocks: which, that's another thing you could change about your code: you have no reason to use unique_ptr. just `Person pers;` would be fine

[03:28:03] <Alipha> poprocks: also, you should either define or delete your copy constructor and copy assignment operator. if you did `Person pers; Person pers2(pers);` then pers.priv and pers2.priv would both point to the same PersonPrivate object, which then you'll end up deleting the same object twice in your destructor.

[03:35:54] <Alipha> !give poprocks ruleof3
[03:35:55] <nolyc> poprocks: If you have one of 1) non-empty destructor 2) copy constructor 3) copy assignment operator then you almost certainly need _all_ three. In C++11, this is optionally extended to the Rule Of Five (by including the move constructor and move assignment operator).
[03:36:26] <Alipha> poprocks: you have a non-empty destructor, so you should have a copy constructor and copy assignment operator (or =delete them)
[03:37:22] <Alipha> it's really too bad that defining a destructor doesn't automatically =delete the copy constructor and copy operator=
[03:38:00] <Alipha> i assume that's backwards-compatibility hold over from c++98, sighs

[06:07:51] <xisop> i'm storing an array of these in a vector if that makes a difference
[06:08:12] <xisop> chance doesn't need to be uint16_t as i only need values 1-100

[06:10:31] <xisop> g++-8
[06:10:35] <xisop> on debian basically

[10:35:00] *** Quits: skapata (~Skapata@user/skapata) (Remote host closed the connection)
[10:37:04] <InPhase> testasty[m]: std::vector was built for this.  Generally speaking, go out of your way to use it unless you can robustly prove that you shouldn't.
[10:38:16] <InPhase> testasty[m]: And if how I spoke wasn't clear, that means:  Almost always use std::vector whenever you can.
[10:38:33] <RandomReader> I'd also suggest avoiding language bare arrays in general -- they don't behave the same way as any other types, which is generally inconvenient for reasoning about your code
[10:38:49] <RandomReader> we've got std::array, std::vector, etc to cover the majority of use cases

[12:20:36] <ville> with a recent-enough, 17, c++ version you may add the inline keyword

[12:32:37] <supernova> why does it need inline
[12:33:46] <ville> it being the static variable?
[12:35:12] <ville> a static member does not _require_ the inline keyword. it's a convenience feature that saves you from having the separate definition for the variable. note definition not declaration.
[12:35:41] <ville> struct aa { int x; }; this _defines_ the variable x
[12:36:04] <ville> struct aa { static int x; }; this does _not_ define the variable x. it is only a _declaration_

[13:26:57] <TinoDidriksen> Statics are pretty awful.
[13:27:02] <RandomReader> in general, logic/execution belongs inside functions, and every program starts by running main()
