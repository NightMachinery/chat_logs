[01:02:07] <Janet> (REDIRECT) ^ Nora En Pure - Aquatic (Extended Mix) - YouTube
[01:02:25] <Jan> there's a piano phrase, a bassline, some contramelody style electronic stuff, percussion
[01:02:28] <morf> it usually goes boom boom 
[01:02:47] <Jan> I'm not clear on what exactly there is an original composition of the credited artist, and how much is remixed or sampled from other things.
[01:04:19] <Jan> I mean that's a track you could make with a decent sampling keyboard in your bedroom
[01:04:24] <Jan> but I don't really get how it works.
[01:05:18] <Jan> for background I'm a bass player, I have played samples for people but I don't get involved any further than that.

[03:44:22] <piercedwater-> garlic with 5 cheeses on pizza bread
[03:44:31] <artao> yes. those are very yummy too

[03:45:48] <artao> new york style pizza. HUGE slices
[03:46:04] <artao> like, 2ft diameter pizzas
[03:46:09] <piercedwater-> mm
[03:46:17] <artao> sold by the slice. crazy selection of toppings
[03:46:31] <artao> not really an "order delivery" place. buy a few slices place
[03:46:37] <maplefinger> it really does vary tho

[03:46:50] <maplefinger> about 50% of NYC pizza is trashy
[03:46:55] <piercedwater-> been into calzones lately
[03:47:04] <maplefinger> they have a topping called "white sauce."
[03:47:05] <artao> pan pizza with another pizza on top basically
[03:47:11] <Panther> kinda greasy in there
[03:47:15] <artao> almost 2 inches thick. LOADED with cheese
[03:47:19] <artao> oh yeah. quite greasy
[03:47:28] <piercedwater-> i'd try it just for fun
[03:48:39] <artao> i'll sometimes make a "mock" stuffed pizza. Buy one rising crust, a bag of shredded cheese, a jar of pizza sauce, and another thin pizza
[03:48:51] <artao> perhaps some extra innards like mushrooms and black olives
[03:49:30] <artao> pile cheese and other on top of the rising crust, put the other pizza on top, upside down. Put sauce and cheese on the top
[03:49:42] <piercedwater-> :)
[03:49:44] <artao> takes a good hour to bake, of course

[16:13:21] <murthy> Most of the bollywood movies are Hollywood rip offs, so I mostly avoid bollywood movies. Mostly watch documentary movies of bollywood
[16:13:30] <hype> It was a very interesting movie. I watched it at the cinema and bought it at the iTunes Store.
[16:13:45] <Panther> “For what I always hated and detested and cursed above all things was this contentment, this healthiness and comfort, this carefully preserved optimism of the middle classes, this fat and prosperous brood of mediocrity.”
[16:13:45] <Panther> ― Hermann Hesse, Steppenwolf 
[16:14:02] <murthy> Panther: I have to watch the movie to know how is Steppenwolf and whether its good or bad to become like him
[16:14:58] <Panther> “Most men will not swim before they are able to.” Is that not witty? Naturally, they won't swim! They are born for the solid earth, not for the water. And naturally they wont think. They are made for life, not for thought. Yes, and he who thinks, what’s more, he who makes thought his business, he may go far in it, but he has bartered the solid earth for the water all the same, and one 
[16:14:58] <Panther> day he will drown.” 
[16:15:37] <Panther> It's not a choice.
[16:16:18] <murthy> very nice, I agree with it except "the healthiness"
[16:16:36] <murthy> I would accept any other status
[16:17:08] <murthy> other than that I always think that learning stops when we think we know all

[20:30:14] <nativetexan> water just spreads the heat murthy
[20:30:24] <morf> it helps a bit 
[20:30:40] <murthy> pepper is a form of acid, water would dilute it
[20:30:46] <macrobat> is not acid

[20:31:15] <macrobat> milk has fat. maybe there are other fatty drinks
[20:32:16] <morf> Psychologist Paul Rozin suggests that eating chilies is an example of a "constrained risk" like riding a roller coaster, in which extreme sensations like pain and fear can be enjoyed because individuals know that these sensations are not actually harmful. This method lets people experience extreme feelings without any significant risk of bodily harm.

[20:33:47] <morf> murthy: Capsaicin (8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide) is an active component of chili peppers, which are plants belonging to the genus Capsicum. It is a chemical irritant for mammals, including humans, and produces a sensation of burning in any tissue with which it comes into contact. Capsaicin and several related alkaloids are called capsaicinoids and are produced as secondary metabolites by chili peppers, probably as deterrents against certain 
[20:33:48] <morf> mammals and fungi.[
[20:34:23] <nativetexan> you missed some excellent fajitas and margaritas yesterday morf, i made all the extras for fajitas too
[20:34:33] <morf> i didn't eat hot food for some time, so i'm enjoying some spicy foods 
[20:34:35] <murthy> The burning and painful sensations associated with capsaicin result from its chemical interaction with sensory neurons. Capsaicin, as a member of the vanilloid family, binds to a receptor called the vanilloid receptor subtype 1
[20:34:50] <morf> nativetexan: nice :) 
[20:34:56] <murthy> The vanilloids are compounds which possess a vanillyl group. They include vanillyl alcohol, vanillin, vanillic acid, acetovanillon, vanillylmandelic acid, homovanillic acid, capsaicin, 
[20:35:01] <morf> well i got pretty drunk myself 
[20:35:03] <murthy> so it could be acidic
[20:35:16] <morf> drank like 4 bottles of wine 
[20:35:21] <nativetexan> dayum
[20:35:29] <murthy> morf: last supper?
[20:35:32] <morf> vanilloid you say? :) never heard of it 
[20:35:34] <nativetexan> i'd be throwing that up
[20:35:58] <murthy> funny they call it vanilloid
[20:36:11] <nativetexan> or at least hung over from hell
