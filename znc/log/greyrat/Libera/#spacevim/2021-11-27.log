[17:38:25] <SpaceVimBot_> <trueleo> Hello! I tried spacevim today with neovide. it's very cool. I am trying to set it up for rust but i am not able to get rust analyzer working. i enabled lang#rust as in docs and did this in addition to that
[17:38:25] <SpaceVimBot_> <trueleo> ```
[17:38:27] <SpaceVimBot_> <trueleo> [[layers]]
[17:38:28] <SpaceVimBot_> <trueleo>   name = "lsp"
[17:38:29] <SpaceVimBot_> <trueleo>   filetypes = [
[17:38:30] <SpaceVimBot_> <trueleo>     "rust"
[17:38:32] <SpaceVimBot_> <trueleo>   ]
[17:38:33] <SpaceVimBot_> <trueleo>   [layers.override_cmd]
[17:38:34] <SpaceVimBot_> <trueleo>     rust = ["rust-analyzer"]
[17:38:36] <SpaceVimBot_> <trueleo> ```
[17:39:11] <SpaceVimBot_> <trueleo> I am on Archlinux with rust-analyzer installed at /usr/bin/rust-analyzer
[17:41:14] <SpaceVimBot_> <trueleo> I'll let you guys know it fresh installing helps :p
[18:03:12] <SpaceVimBot_> <trueleo> nope
