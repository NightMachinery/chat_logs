[00:14:13] <knstn> Thanks for pointing out my mistake. I got the meaning of +() all wrong.
[00:16:52] <emanuele6> knstn: initially i assumed it worked and you were seeing it behave similarly to `**/*.jpg **/*.mp4', so i proposed @(**/*.jpg|**/*.mp4) as an alternative that makes more sense than +(**/*.jpg|**/*.mp4) ( @(pat1|pat2) means exactly one of either pat1 or pat2 )
[00:17:21] <emanuele6> but that doesn't work either single globstar globs can't be put in a {@,+,?,!}() group

[00:18:52] <emanuele6> you can only use   **/*.jpg **/*.mp4   or    **/*.{mp4,jpg} (which expands to the two globs shown before before pathname expansion) or you can use the extglob    **/*.@(jpg|mp4)    to do it in a single glob
[00:19:48] <emanuele6> if you use   **/*.jpg **/*.mp4   or   **/*.{mp4,jpg}   (they are exactly the same) you don't need extglob
[00:20:07] <emanuele6> if you use    **/*.@(jpg|mp4)   you need extglob
[00:21:16] <emanuele6> but maybe   **/*.@(jpg|mp4)   only requires checking files once so it might me better, i am not sure since i have not used globstar much.

[02:56:15] <emanuele6> yes
[02:56:17] <e36freak> 0 is everything matched, and then each group gets assigned to an index in sequence after that
[02:56:24] <e36freak> !august
[02:56:24] <greybot> August is the month when all your scripts break because you placed $(date +%m) in a variable and tried to do arithmetic with it, without removing the leading zeros. 08 is considered octal. Use $((10#$month)) to force decimal, or strip the zero.
[02:56:33] <iconoclasthero> yeah i know all about 07
[02:56:35] <iconoclasthero> p8*
[02:56:37] <iconoclasthero> fuck
[02:56:38] <iconoclasthero> 08*
[02:56:40] <e36freak> lol
[02:56:52] * neshpion just learned about BASH_REMATCH
[02:57:04] <emanuele6> !BASH_REMATCH > neshpion: have fun
[02:57:05] <greybot> neshpion: have fun: The =~ operator of [[ evaluates the left hand string against the right hand ERE (see <ere>, <regex>). After a successful match, the BASH_REMATCH array contains the matched string and subexpressions (if any). Any quoted characters in the ERE become literal. Best to put the whole ERE in a variable: [[ $string =~ $regex ]]

[05:58:30] <renatosilva> problem is I want several objects with these data, so nested
[05:58:31] <e36freak> the easiest way to make a config file would be to just put those exact variable assignments in the config, and source it
[05:58:37] <e36freak> use comments to clarify
[05:59:12] <e36freak> don't overcomplicate things
[05:59:14] <renatosilva> I'm thinking about something, how can I know the list of arrays/variables defined by a sourced script?
[05:59:29] <e36freak> there's no reason to have a more complicated data structure in the config file than in the actual script
[05:59:52] <e36freak> you have a sample/empty config file to use with all of the stuff you need defined
[06:00:00] <e36freak> if anything's missing, you have a default value is the actual script
[06:00:14] <e36freak> go through the variables, check if they're set and not-empty, and if they're not you assign the default whatever
[06:00:15] <renatosilva> I'm currently sourcing them indeed, actually taking advantage of things like shell expansion etc
[06:00:28] <e36freak> anything defined in the config that you don't need just gets ignored

[06:00:59] <renatosilva> don't overcomplicate things -- that's exactly what I'm trying to, find the simplest best solution
[06:01:13] <e36freak> !config
[06:01:13] <greybot> If your script needs configuration, the way to do that in bash is to create a config file that adheres to bash syntax and source that file from the beginning of your script: source ~/.myscript.conf
[06:01:24] <e36freak> that's really the simplest solution
[06:01:30] <e36freak> i promise
[06:01:43] <e36freak> and it works great
[06:02:04] <renatosilva> I'm currently using this, and I have the stated problem of nested config:
[06:02:15] <e36freak> i still don't understand why you think you need nesting
[06:02:27] <e36freak> when your actual data structures that you're putting the data into aren't nested
[06:02:58] <e36freak> json is used for configs because, again, it can mimic the actual data structure you're using exactly

[06:05:03] <renatosilva> how to associate blah with the corresponding section?
[06:05:10] <e36freak> section1_blah=(
[06:05:14] <renatosilva> bash doesn't have nested structures
[06:05:19] <e36freak> RIGHT
[06:05:23] <e36freak> and it's for a bash script
[06:05:27] <renatosilva> the closer to this are the hashes
[06:05:28] <e36freak> so how are you storing it IN the script?
[06:05:45] <renatosilva> look, let me explain better
[06:05:51] <renatosilva> current implementation is
[06:06:43] <renatosilva> there is a folder with files, each file is a sourced script that sets keys=values and defines a list=(of several lines)
[06:07:00] *** Quits: ZAJDAN (~ZAJDAN@chladek-jar.zno.skynet.cz) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[06:07:29] <renatosilva> so it works because I loop the files and source the script, so I get variables and arrays within the loop
[06:07:42] <e36freak> so you want to run the same code over and over on each "section" ?
[06:07:46] <renatosilva> what I want is to join all these files into one single file
[06:07:58] <renatosilva> so you want to run the same code over and over on each "section" ? ??????
[06:08:03] <renatosilva> no
[06:08:18] <e36freak> then how do you differentiate between list=(foo) from the first file and the second
[06:08:22] <e36freak> when you're storing it in the script
[06:08:34] <renatosilva> the solution is working, but it uses files in a directory to represent each section
[06:08:50] <renatosilva> I want to join all these files into a single one
[06:08:52] <e36freak> you're missing what i'm asking here
[06:09:13] <e36freak> you source the first "section" file, right?
[06:09:14] <renatosilva> then how do you differentiate between list=(foo) from the first file and the second...
[06:09:21] <e36freak> and you populate an array "list"
[06:09:22] *** Joins: laksith (~laksith@laksith.dev)
[06:09:27] <e36freak> then you read the second file
[06:09:32] <e36freak> and it also has an array "list"
[06:09:37] <e36freak> it's going to overwrite the first one, right?
[06:10:13] <renatosilva> once I process each section (currently implemented as separate file), I don't need the data anymore. I don't need to store all sections, I just need to loop through them

[06:10:35] <e36freak> so you are looping and running the same stuff for each "section"
[06:11:44] <e36freak> then your options are to keep using multiple files, which honestly isn't a bad solution to begin with and i don't know why you don't like it
[06:11:53] <renatosilva> the files/sections are the same variables and arrays but with different data
[06:12:03] <e36freak> obviously, yes
[06:12:14] <e36freak> the same data in each would be not helpful
[06:12:19] <e36freak> but you're doing the same shit with each one
[06:12:26] <renatosilva> honestly isn't a bad solution -- it is
[06:12:33] <e36freak> why?
[06:12:49] <e36freak> you could also use one big file with section markers in comments
[06:13:17] <e36freak> and just read up to the next section marker, source or eval that, and do your stuff on it
[06:13:30] <e36freak> in a loop

[06:15:46] <emanuele6> or write a section of key=value, call a function named "end_section" that does stuff with the variables in the section and unsets the variables when its done, write another section of key=value, call "end_section", repeat

[13:39:27] <pa_> oke i understand that now.. but.. i have written couple of router management scripts and they all use the shopt -s failglob and they all still working.. and this script worked fine, but only after wanting to clean up the code and put it in function to avoid code repeating... suddenly it breaks.. oke thanks i will go read the link now..

[13:43:31] <emanuele6> still, there is `set -f' that you could use, but really you should be using a while read loop as the faq says
[13:43:36] <emanuele6> !-f
[13:43:36] <greybot> Do you actually need that -f in that command? If there a reason you are using it? Or is it just there because of habit? Do you actually know what the -f does and do you even want it there?
[13:43:43] <emanuele6> wrong factoid
[13:43:46] <emanuele6> !set-f

[14:10:04] <pa_> emanuele6: other question.. i remember that i once had an add-on that had bunch of bash code snippets.. like instead of typing the whole while loop .. you just type loop and can select between the different loops and hit enter and a template loop is inserted.. but i cant remember what it was called.. and is there such a thing with all of wooledge best practice things..

[19:41:07] <redgloboli> hi, i have a program which sets environment variable which looks like this: stor0/VM/vm-MYMACHINE/TEST and sometimes it looks like this stor0/VM/vm-MYMACHINE. if i set MYVAR=${PROGVAR##*/} and do a echo $MYVAR it is working as i want it for the second variable and i get vm-MYMACHINE, but for the first variable i get TEST. Is there a better way to get only vm-MYMACHINE on every occurance?

[22:46:00] <e36freak> what happens if you have a file named "-foo.apk"

[22:46:28] <e36freak> if you have ./-foo.apk, it knows it's a filename
[22:46:40] <e36freak> so put ./ in front of your globs to safely handle filenames that start with dashes
[22:46:46] <wyre> oh, but then the problem wasn't in the quoting? 🤔
[22:46:54] <e36freak> no

[23:41:13] <hentai> And then  same, but swapping A and B
