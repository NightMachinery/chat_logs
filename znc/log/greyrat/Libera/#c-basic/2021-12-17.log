[22:09:41] <lavaball> see does have case right? or switch? i'm sure you know what i mean, instead of a lot of ifs one switch or case or what not.
[22:09:46] <lavaball> oh, c, not see.

[22:17:57] <lavaball> also so whenever i button0 it checks what weapon i'm holding and then fires accordingly. wouldn't it be smarter to set the weapon i'm holding in a variable and then just call that instead of checking for every button0 press? oh wait, then i would have to check the variable again. but couldn't i use a pointer to then point to a different function? well, probably not in quake c, but in normal c. there are pointers in c, right? 
[22:19:35] <lavaball> gotta say, learning all this is quite entertaining. i wish there were more use cases out there so more people would enjoy it. i mean i only do it, because i need it for fortress and there i'm only doing quakec not actual c.
