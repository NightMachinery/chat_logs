[07:57:22] <white2> what
[08:04:19] <BASHitup> K ... so I ran Lynis and found out my adapter is in promiscous mode or so it says. The only reason it would be in promiscuous mode is that I ran TCPdump
[08:04:52] <BASHitup> ... But I would think it would only stay in that mode during the scan. If I run a packet dump, does it switch back to the default mode after the dump or will it stay in promiscuous mode indefintely?
[08:05:02] <BASHitup> I'm audting my system, making sure it's OK ...

[08:07:53] <BASHitup> It's cool either way. No judgements from me.
[08:08:15] <BASHitup> And I ran a script. It's not in promiscuous mode. So I don't know what's up with Lynis
[08:09:36] <ajak> yes, tcpdump turns off promiscuous mode after it's done

[19:04:56] <kittonian> hi all. i'm trying to wrap my head around the best way to encrypt certain data. Everything I am reading says that you shouldn't encrypt/decrypt with the public/private keys, but instead create a symmetric key based off of the public/private keys each time you want to encrypt/decrypt the data.
[19:05:32] *** Joins: [itchyjunk] (~itchyjunk@user/itchyjunk/x-7353470)
[19:05:43] <kittonian> As the symmetric key is identical each time you create it, as long as you use the same salt, what is the point of creating it each time, instead of storing it and only using the symmetric key?
[19:06:06] <ajak> it shouldn't be identical each time you create it
[19:06:20] <kittonian> I honestly don't understand why you would do that, if system resources are not the issue, when asymmetric is far more secure
[19:06:41] <kittonian> ajak, if you use the same salt and base it off the same public/private key, the symmetric key is identical each time it's created
[19:07:07] <kittonian> and if it's not and you need to access a bunch of encrypted data, you wouldn't be able to decrypt all the data
[19:07:15] <kittonian> this is not for end to end encryption in a chat app

[19:11:05] *** Quits: rulezzz (~rault@187.204.98.61) (Quit: me voy)
[19:11:39] <kittonian> so, in a situation where you want to allow the user to create new entries for their account, store them in a remote db fully encrypted, and allow the user to query that db and run various reports on their data, edit entries, etc., what is the best course of action for doing that encryption?
[19:13:05] <kittonian> i can store their public/private keys in keychain, and create a single use symmetric key each time they need to encrypt or decrypt, but since that symmetric key is the same every time, isn't that just more overhead/resources?
[19:13:41] <kittonian> but if I only create a symmetric key and store that, what's the point of the public/private keys being stored at all?
[19:16:01] <kittonian> or do I create/store a public/private key, then create/store a symmetric key for all encryption/decryption, and then create a signing public/private key based off of the original public/private key and sign all the encrypted transfers and verify the signature upon fetch from the backend?
[19:17:20] *** Joins: Henry_ (~mahengrui@user/mahengrui1)
[19:17:34] <TimMc> kittonian: First, the main reason I'm aware of for using "session keys" is simply that asymmetric encryption tends to be much slower than symmetric.

[19:18:15] <TimMc> but of course symmetric lacks certain very important security properties, so you use asymmetric to "bootstrap" the encryption.
[19:18:41] <kittonian> TimMc, agreed, but in this case I've tested both and for the small amount of text based data it's not an important factor. Plus, all the encryption and decryption is being done on device
[19:19:11] <labrador> kittonian, don't make your clients suffer for your implementation problem...which everyone has gotten right
[19:19:12] <TimMc> There may also be some consideration around block sizes. Not sure.

[19:20:47] <kittonian> what i'm asking is, in this scenario, which I've described, where you can't create a new symmetric key with a random salt each time because you'd never be able to decrypt the data, you are essentially taking asymmetric encryption out of the equation and only using a single symmetric key
[19:21:12] <labrador> kittonian, just use a random symmetric key
[19:21:15] <kittonian> TimMc, single use as in it's created on the fly each time data needs to be encrypted or decrypted. which i said doesn't make any sense

[19:23:23] <kittonian> if a user created 100 entries and I encrypt each one separately with a newly generated symmetric key, i would need to store all 100 of those keys in order to decrypt the user's data
[19:23:33] <kittonian> unless i'm misunderstanding something
[19:23:45] <ajak> and if you're storing the cryptographic material anyway, what's the point of encrypting?
[19:24:21] <TimMc> kittonian: The standard approach here is that each symmetric key is encrypted with the asymmetric key and then prepended to the symmetric-encrypted data.
[19:24:29] <kittonian> ajak, i don't understand
[19:24:38] <ajak> me either
[19:24:55] <kittonian> ajak, are you talking about storing the keys?
[19:25:06] <ajak> yes
[19:25:13] <TimMc> So each blob is a header containing the encrypted symmetric key, followed by a body containing the encrypted data.

[19:26:30] <ajak> s/is/isn't/
[19:26:33] <kittonian> TimMc, are you saying that you literally prepend the encrypted data with the symmetric key?
[19:26:40] <TimMc> Basically.
[19:27:05] <TimMc> It's like someone sends you a box and when you unlock it, there's a key and another locked box. :-)
[19:27:07] <kittonian> and then you use a dash or something to separate when you parse the data for decryption
[19:27:23] <kittonian> right but here's the issue i see with that idea
[19:27:32] <TimMc> Usually just a fixed header size, but you could use a delimiter.
[19:27:51] <kittonian> if a hacker gains access to the database and downloads it all, they would then have all the symmetric keys to decrypt the data, thereby rendering the encryption worthless
[19:28:09] *** Quits: _inky (~inky_@5.77.206.101) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[19:28:12] <TimMc> No, the symmetric key is encrypted.
[19:28:34] <kittonian> ok, this is where i'm getting lost
[19:28:47] <kittonian> if you encrypt the symmetric key, how does the user decrypt?
[19:28:59] <TimMc> OK, you've got an asymmetric keypair Ap/As (public, secret)? And you generate a new symmetric key S.
[19:29:16] *** Joins: creechy (~mock@user/creechy)

[19:29:22] <kittonian> i'm with you

[19:30:33] <TimMc> That first "encrypt" is asymemtric, and the second is symmetric. Totally different functions, in practice.

[19:31:22] <kittonian> i'm truly sorry, i do not. i'm really trying to understand
[19:32:01] <kittonian> with apple's cryptokit, it seems that to use a sealedbox, you must use a symmetric key only based off of a public/private key pair

[19:35:11] <labrador> hybrid encryption
[19:35:23] <TimMc> They use As to decrypt the header (the first part of the blob) revealing the symmetric key, then they use that symmetric key to decrypt the second part.

[19:53:12] <TimMc> What I mean is, in opposition to just "user A encrypts and then later decrypts".
[19:53:13] <kittonian> ok, fair enough
[19:53:25] <kittonian> yes, you are correct in your thinking
[19:53:38] <TimMc> OK, so this explains the need for asymmetric encryption.
[19:53:43] <kittonian> exactly
[19:54:26] <kittonian> btw, you have mentioned the word blob a number of times. are you actually talking about the blob data type, or simply referring to the string as a blob?
[19:54:52] <TimMc> "Chunk of bytes".
[19:54:56] <labrador> kittonian, once encrypted its about as good as a blob
[19:55:02] <labrador> opaque data
[19:55:21] <kittonian> so a string (or rather a text data type)
[19:55:27] <kittonian> i understand
[19:55:33] <labrador> could be an image too kittonian but yeah
[19:55:38] <kittonian> just want to ensure i'm following everything

[19:55:56] <labrador> Encryption doesn't really distinguish between what its encrypting
[19:56:21] <TimMc> OK, so one possible design here is that for each document/message/piece of data (I'm going to call them documents for sake of simplicity), the owning user generates a new symmetric key just for that document. The document is encrypted with the symmetric key and sent to the server.
[19:56:33] <kittonian> labrador, storing an image in a db is a different data type from my experience. are you saying that in this case all columns could just be text data types and it wouldn't care?

[19:56:46] <TimMc> Apachez: on-topic discussion currently happening
[19:57:21] <TimMc> When the user wants to share the document, they tell another user the ID of the DB entry and give them the symmetric key -- encrypted using the other user's public key.
[19:58:05] <TimMc> This is still hybrid encryption, but it separates the two parts I described earlier.
[19:58:07] <Apachez> TimMc: dont be rude

[19:58:30] <Apachez> wwIII is very much on topic and security related
[19:58:46] <kittonian> if you are saying that each entry is stored with the symmetric key, encrypted, and then a two-step process occurs to decrypt, wouldn't it be the same for the shared user because they too would have the original user's public/private keys stored on their device
[19:59:07] <TimMc> This way you can send the same symmetric key to multiple recipients and they can all use it to retrieve and decrypt the document.
[19:59:26] <TimMc> I think I may be missing something about this shared user.
[19:59:35] <ajak> Apachez: no, it isn't
[19:59:37] <kittonian> it's not a one-shot deal for the shared user. the shared user would be able to run their own reports on the original user's data
[20:00:30] <kittonian> think of a situation where you have someone in a nursing home who can't care for themselves anymore but you as their guardian need to input various health related data about them. you are the shared user at that point but in essence you are able to do everything for that original user

[20:01:40] <kittonian> but that's ok. using your original scenario where the two-step process happens and the symmetric key is encrypted and stored with the data, the shared user would be able to decrypt just as the original user would
[20:01:42] <kittonian> that works

[20:03:41] <kittonian> TimMc, it very much does. the way the keys are going to be shared between both devices and shared users is via a QR code that will embed these keys and be sent securely to that user after a few authorization steps
[20:05:28] <labrador> wait are you storing any of the keys>?
[20:05:34] <labrador> unencrypted
[20:05:37] <kittonian> no
[20:05:48] <kittonian> we are storing the keys encrypted in an offline db
[20:06:00] <TimMc> That offline DB worries me too. :-)
[20:06:08] <labrador> so the user has to do it online huh
[20:06:10] <kittonian> they will be encrypted with a separate, we'll call it a "master key"

[22:12:10] <shibboleth> well, dhe and ec are used for key exchange

[22:14:21] <kittonian> ok, but i need to asymmetrically encrypt the symmetric key and the use the symmetric key to encrypt the data
[22:14:44] <kittonian> so I'm trying to figure out whether the public/private keys need to be RSA in order to make that happen, or if I can use 25519
[22:15:04] <kittonian> based on the hybrid encryption that was explained to me earlier
[22:17:55] <TimMc> kittonian: cryptokit has something called sealedbox, right?
[22:18:11] <kittonian> yes, and you can use aes-gcm or chachapoly (preferred)

[22:19:32] <TimMc> Elliptic curves can be used *directly* for either key exchange or signatures.
[22:19:36] <kittonian> xcode/swift complains that it expects a symmetric key when doing the encryption
[22:19:59] <TimMc> sealedbox builds on the key exchange operation to make an encryption operation.

[22:38:55] <kittonian> and when creating the key there are only two choice (KeyAgreement, used for creating a shared secret, and Signing, used for comparing digital signatures)
[22:39:03] <kittonian> for Curve25519 I mean
[22:39:22] <Apachez> not to uncommon is that you use symmetric for the actual encryption and protect that with assymetric
[22:39:30] <Apachez> or better yet use a session based symmetric key

[22:55:42] <TimMc> The question, then, is how you're going to share that symmetric key *if and when* sharing is desired. That's what I'm describing.
[22:55:49] <Apachez> TimMc: out of the blue symmetric is rumoured to better withstand quantum bruteforcing
[22:55:55] <kittonian> and then the two encrypted strings will be join together and stored in the db
[22:56:06] <Apachez> on the other hand if you protect your symmetric key using an asymmetric key you are screwed anyway
[22:56:16] <Apachez> perhaps making sure to keep the keystore elsewhere?
[22:56:24] <Apachez> like offline :)
[22:56:43] <TimMc> kittonian: It sounds like a piece of data may need to be shared with multiple other parties, is this correct?
[22:56:45] <kittonian> if sharing is desired, both the user's public and private key will be copied to the shared user's device and stored in their keychain
[22:57:00] <kittonian> then it's literally the same as the user themselves accessing their data
[22:57:04] <TimMc> No one should be sharing private keys ever.
[22:57:05] <Apachez> one way to "share" (dunno if thats bright or not) is to reencrypt to the approved user key
[22:57:20] <Apachez> like the original symmetrically encrypted data remains
[22:57:38] <Apachez> but you pick out a copy to a decrypt box, decrypt and reencrypt using the approved user key
[22:57:42] <kittonian> Apachez, yes, that could also be a possibility if we end up deciding not to share any keys
[22:57:45] <TimMc> If you need to share access, create an intermediary symmetric key that's shared.
[22:57:45] <Apachez> and then take that and publish
[22:57:52] <Apachez> this way the user still only uses their own key
[22:57:54] <kittonian> but then the backend would be decrypting and that's not a good thing
[22:58:11] <Apachez> the critical box is the one doing the reencryption
[22:58:28] <Apachez> and using like datadiodes or such around it
[22:58:33] <Apachez> perhaps with a physical switch
[22:58:48] <Apachez> so its either input from vault or output to internet, not both at the same time
[22:59:12] <kittonian> ok, i think we're getting way ahead of ourselves for the time being
[22:59:14] <TimMc> kittonian: Briefly: symmetric encrypted data goes into DB *without* a header; the symmetric key used can be called the session key. When user A wants to share the data with user B, they use key agreement to derive a shared secret, and that shared secret is used to encrypt the session key.
[22:59:25] <kittonian> right now, i'm just trying to encrypt the symmetric key using the public key
[22:59:39] <kittonian> once that's working we can move on to next steps, but this is confusing enough at the moment
[22:59:40] <Apachez> like something like this to switch https://www.fibersystem.com/product/fiber-optical-switch-1x2-mm/
[22:59:41] <websec> ^ Fiber Optical Switch 1×2 MM | Fibersystem
[22:59:46] <Apachez> along with datadiodes at each end
[23:00:11] <ajak> kittonian: asymmetrically encrypt it just as you would any other data?
[23:00:19] <kittonian> ajak, i can't
[23:00:21] <TimMc> kittonian: The magic here is the key agreement protocol. It takes the public key of one and the private key of the other, *or the other way around*, and either way spits out the same shared secret.
[23:00:23] <kittonian> that's the whole problem
[23:00:36] <Apachez> so you get   internal vault -> datadiode -> switch -> reencryption box -> (same switch as previously channel selector) -> datadiode -> external vault

[23:01:54] <TimMc> So user A takes their private key and user B's public key to make the shared secret. Probably hashes it with a record ID and the sender's ID to give context. Then HKDF or whatever to make a new symmetric key. That's used to encrypt the session key.
[23:02:02] <Apachez> the problem with symmetric key if you dont reencrypt is that the same key is shared among users
[23:02:06] <Apachez> and will leak due to that
[23:02:14] <Apachez> and once its leaked you are screwed
[23:02:20] *** Joins: tehenderz (~tehenderz@ti0018a400-9397.bb.online.no)
[23:02:34] <TimMc> On receipt, user B takes *their* private key and user A's *public* key and does the same thing. The magic of ECC key agreement is that this somehow works. :-)
[23:02:49] <TimMc> (The math here is actually pretty simple and interesting.)
[23:02:56] <Apachez> "magic" and "somehow works" isnt convincing ;)

[23:03:41] <TimMc> It's very, very different from how RSA works.
[23:03:58] <kittonian> TimMc, that's something to discuss for sure, and I appreciate the explanation, but if we do that from the beginning, the same symmetric key will also need to be used and we don't want that
[23:04:18] <TimMc> "the same symmetric key" -- are you referring to the session key?
[23:04:19] <kittonian> which is why I really liked your hybrid encryption idea and moved forward with it

[23:17:25] <ash_worksi> obviously github will check what permissions codesandbox.io has to act on your behalf before attempting to do anything, but the point is, this kind of system reminds me a lot of permissions on android
[23:18:12] <ash_worksi> I was wondering, is there a term for this platform of behavior?
[23:19:33] <ash_worksi> because, right now if I have authorized codesandbox both times, and I check github, there is only 1 authorization for codesandbox I can revoke
[23:20:02] <ash_worksi> in otherwords, unlike android, you do not have discrete control over scopes on github
