[02:30:41] <k04dz> hi all
[02:30:59] <k04dz> how do i download the "default" quality of audio, for a given video?
[02:31:11] <k04dz> but without downloading the video, at all?
[02:31:45] <k04dz> so to recap, i want to do this: download a video, but only the audio portion, at its "default" level of quality (not necessarily the best, nor the worst). 
[02:32:20] <k04dz> youtube-dl -f '????' 'http://youtube.com/blah'
[02:33:01] <k04dz> youtube-dl -f 'novideo,audio' 'http://youtube.com/blah' or something like that?

[03:50:08] <k04dz> anyone here
[03:55:01] <sese[m]> ```
[03:55:01] <sese[m]> youtube-dl -x 'http://youtube.com/blah'
[03:55:01] <sese[m]> ```
[03:55:01] <sese[m]> should do the trick. There is no "default" level of quality. With -x, you get the "best" quality.
[03:56:07] <k04dz> hi sese[m] 
[03:56:21] <k04dz> oh ok.
[03:56:45] <k04dz> well, im downloading an entire album. if i use the highest quality, it will be a big file.
[03:56:54] <k04dz> and i have little room.
[03:57:27] <k04dz> thanks tho.
