[00:28:17] <CableNinja> @sea esxi is the best (free) route. it obviously has some limitations, but that all depends on your backupsoftware

[05:08:42] <signofzeta> But if you can get carte blanche for port 22, PowerShell can run over that on macOS/Linux.
[05:09:48] <MoonBounce> getting promoted isnt a option because my manager agrees with me and gave up fighting the fight
[05:10:37] <MoonBounce> maybe its time for me to look for a new place i guess
[05:12:33] <signofzeta> Well, MoonBounce, I feel the same way.  This was my penultimate week at my current job.  After that, I start a full-remote, fewer-hours job with overtime and a 50% raise.
[05:13:18] <MoonBounce> honestly i dont really hate it too bad at my current place. i get a decent salary and bonus, as well as hours. its just that some days are light, some days are brutal, and i feel the tech stack is kinda outdated and slow to improve
[05:13:32] <MoonBounce> i like my team at least, not my department :D
[05:14:13] <signofzeta> Agreed.  I can do 20 hours or 50 hours and get the same pay.  I love my immediate team, but management avoids work (and our ticketing system) by emailing us low-lives directly.

[08:01:18] <catbeard> don't you mean youse people
[08:11:22] <CableNinja> any recommendations for a good headset? I like the pair I've got at home now but they fell apart pretty fast. the ones I have for work are too tight and make me feel like my heads being squeezed. the home pair are MPOW, fairly cheap but pretty effective, idk what the work ones are, would have to go look
[08:11:41] <catbeard> anker soundcore q20/q30
[08:11:51] <catbeard> works very well for me, bluetooth HSP/HFP
[08:12:06] <catbeard> kamfy
[08:12:17] <catbeard> and noise cancelling
[08:15:21] <sideup66> catbeard: my headset is currently a steel series arctis 7
[08:15:33] <sideup66> Could use a keyboard though
[08:17:06] <JollyRgrs> mine, too sideup66 
[08:17:18] <sideup66> It works, comfy
[08:17:35] <JollyRgrs> i like it b/c i can put my mic monitor into the aux in on the usb dongle and get p. much realtime talkback
[08:17:47] <sideup66> Maybe a new chair, when I built my setup I used a high back leather from office Depot but I found it's not fun in summer and the cushion goes flat somtimes
[08:17:55] <JollyRgrs> i think some of the others might be more comfy, but none others have that option for the aux in to dual-input at the same time
[08:18:03] <sideup66> I never figured out that aux thing in the dock of it
[08:18:21] <JollyRgrs> so it is meant for you to plug your phone into and then it'll feed BOTH things into your headset
[08:18:27] <JollyRgrs> so you don't have to switch for a phone call
[08:18:47] <JollyRgrs> but i just use it with my mixing board to feed my raw mic into it for feedback so I don't talk so loud with headphones on
[08:19:11] <JollyRgrs> and then i do the output to my speakers, so i never switch inputs on my PC, I just power on or off my headset
[08:19:14] <JollyRgrs> it's kinda nice
[08:19:30] <sideup66> Oh my GOD
[08:19:38] <sideup66> That is what I wanted for my work PC
[08:19:53] <JollyRgrs> the arctis 7 is the only wireless headset that i know that works this way
[08:20:09] <sideup66> Pump headset from that to the headset so when I'm working I can be on personal and still listen to whatever WebEx I'm in
[08:20:14] <JollyRgrs> so i had one... the volume wheel jacked up
[08:20:21] <JollyRgrs> so i got BBY to replace it, but I Wanted to get a diff headset
[08:20:28] <JollyRgrs> but nothing else had what I wanted in features like this
[08:22:09] <sideup66> I want to get line out from my work laptop into the arctis
[08:22:29] <sideup66> And then from there into my headset with the USB connected to my desk pc
[08:23:23] <sideup66> Also a protip for that headset JollyRgrs is to get a good equalizer on your PC, when I'm just using mine for music it makes a HUGE difference, I found this amazing profile setup for a program called Peace
[08:23:53] <sideup66> https://amp.reddit.com/r/steelseries/comments/65ogu1/best_arctis_7_equalizer_settings/
[08:24:03] <sideup66> Old ass post but dear GOD does it make a difference
[08:24:08] <sideup66> Spotify is amazing on it
[08:28:06] <Adagio> I use a Senn HD 558 Focusrite Scarlett Solo for everything; it's pretty solid

[17:33:06] <riff-IRC> I remember around 1993 when we had a control system that would wig out when 2 generators were sync'd together. It would bomb out with a variety of errors, ranging from general protection faults all the way to hard lockups caused by setting EAX to 0000:0000 and issuing a JMP EAX
[17:33:42] <riff-IRC> or <some critical CPU register> wandering off into the woods

[17:35:32] <riff-IRC> we ended up attaching around $150M-$200M worth of debugging equipment to this system in an effort to find out why it was crashing in the way it did
[17:37:15] <riff-IRC> long story short, it was a serious electrical fault in the building's wiring resulting in a roughly 960V ground loop forming (or 1440V if line sync was active)
[17:39:03] <riff-IRC> well, a ground loop that ended up floating the line ground up to 960V or 1440V, depending on the line configuration
[17:39:25] <riff-IRC> that of course REALLY jacked with anything using that as a ground ref.
