[01:01:43] <r3boot> earnestly: the problem with the unix permission model is that is trivially broken by uid=0
[01:01:56] <demize> The former is also significantly simpler.
[01:02:09] <BrainDamage> i think it boils to espectations
[01:02:21] <demize> The latter being significantly more complex for one leads to a significantly larger attack surface.

[01:39:13] <r3boot> I mean, I love the tech, dont get me wrong, but the upkeep is soooooo high
[01:39:20] <demize> The kernel is worse, because distributions that are actually meant for server usage ships old kernels, and it's impossible to keep track of everything that could be a security fix.
[01:39:55] <demize> With Kubernetes people generally don't run distro things, so there's a higher chance that newer versions will at least be easily available.

[01:44:30] <BrainDamage> that kind of makes me wonder, the kernel has a policy to not break userspace, does that somehow mean that the people using those ancient kernels need ancient modules because they interface with kernel api?
[01:44:45] <BrainDamage> or is it just cargo culting?
[01:45:03] <MacGyver> demize: No, there would still be holes.
[01:45:05] <r3boot> mja, its also not feasible to fix *everything*, since that leads to high upkeep. Imho, if its a cve it needs to be patched
[01:45:19] <demize> BrainDamage: When it comes to distros it's just because traditional distros like RHEL and Debian don't want to update major releases because they don't want to do that.  :p
[01:45:26] <MacGyver> demize: The point is that many holes are never recognized as such before they're fixed as "normal bugs".
[01:45:32] <r3boot> and yes, that also means new holes (0days), which eventually will get reported and fixed
[01:45:38] <MacGyver> demize: But *normal* bugs don't get fixes backported.

[02:58:04] <alschaapman> Is that all it comes down to?
[02:59:07] <Namarrgon> you can assume bsdtar to be available since pacman is using it anyway, no need to worry about any other implementation

[02:59:28] <grawlinson> libarchive tends to handle weird archives well, iirc
[02:59:33] <thurstylark> well, also that libarchive is the most prominent C library for handling tar files as far as I can tell, and pacman would rather use a library for that if possible so...
[02:59:40] <Namarrgon> at least on arch, other distros might split out the library/executable

[03:21:22] <MacGyver> Oh I should read further up before saying anything >.<
[03:21:28] <MacGyver> Never mind me :')
[03:21:36] <kaivai> lol :D
[03:22:05] <MacGyver> tt: Tried headphones / no headphones?
[03:23:06] <tt> no, il lsee. but basically if i press down on the laptop case under where the keyboard is the audio works, then as i relase pressure it goes silent again
[03:23:09] <MacGyver> If headphones don't work but the laptop's speakers do, you might be able to get this fixed out-of-warranty with some soldering skills, basically.
[03:23:30] <tt> i might try opening and see whats going on there
[03:23:57] <tt> or ill just rest my wrist  on the  area that makes audio work xD
[03:24:01] <tt> its liek a dead mans switch for audio

[05:21:31] <asd> though nixos was basically with basically only vim and git installed
[05:21:42] <MacGyver> Like I said, last thing I can think of that might be doing background stuffs is Windows updates. Pulling in updates, processing them, and needing some qemu processing for the networking.

[08:54:20] <hendry> jaawerth: i'm strugging to understand how to use `xdg-settings set default-web-browser`
[08:54:36] <hendry> how do you switch between Firefox profile "foo" and Google Chrome profile "bar"?
[08:56:36] <jaawerth> you would need to create desktop files for each profile (since just setting it to firefox simply launches with the default profile) with an equivalent that launches FF with `-P 'name of profile'` or whatever the chrome equiv is
[08:57:50] <jaawerth> desktop entries - https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Desktop_entries

[08:59:00] <hendry> assuming I have ~/.local/share/applications/firefox-personal.desktop setup, how do I use `xdg-settings` to use that?

[08:59:47] <jaawerth> it's basically just like `xdg-settings set default-web-browser foo.desktop`
[09:00:18] <hendry> jaawerth: sorry, you're right
[09:00:52] <jaawerth> nbd
[09:00:52] <hendry> I was getting confused with "x-scheme-handler/http"
[09:02:07] <hendry> say i run `xdg-settings get default-web-browser` and get back google-chrome.desktop. How do I show that config or know where it lives?
[09:02:09] <jaawerth> yeah.. iirc default-web-browser just sets the fallback for all the web-browser-centric mime types and then you can override them individually with xdg-mime but I could be getting it wrong or oversimplifying
[09:02:31] <jaawerth> show what config? the desktop entry?

[15:28:04] <matthewcroughan> If no testing or review happened, I wanna know, because I always thought there was some process in Arch.
[15:28:13] <matthewcroughan> I'm not insulting, I just want to know how things happen in Arch.
[15:28:41] <thrice> first, did you even look for the bug tracker?  It's pretty easy to find
[15:29:19] <mpan> matthewcroughan: the page has been updated by the person, who also maintains the package. Glimpsing over the old page sources, it has been done because the page was outdated. The bug tracker is linked from the package. Editing wiki works as it does for any other wiki. In both cases you need an account.
[15:29:30] <thrice> as for the process, typically packages are maintained by people who use the package, yes, so it's somewhat assumed that the maintainer did some checks before uploading.  The wiki is pretty easy to get out of date, as arch moves quickly
[15:29:38] <mpan> skimming over*

[15:34:10] <matthewcroughan> I only want to see comments from people, if it's a mailing list, etc.
[15:34:24] <Foxboron> Arch doesn't work as nixpkgs, maintainers upload packages as they wish to svn
[15:34:42] <matthewcroughan> That's fine, I just expected there'd be some forum or some place that messaging happened before an official package gets pumped out.
[15:34:47] <matthewcroughan> Is that not the case?
[15:35:29] <Foxboron> No, we have trusted packagers so they are allowed to act on their best interest.

[15:42:45] <matthewcroughan> instead of ostracizing me, you could say "sure".
[15:42:57] <matthewcroughan> you don't have to be mean on the internet 
[15:42:58] <Foxboron> matthewcroughan: And nixpkgs doesn't have any way to authenticate users or attest changes to a person, because there is a barrier of entry.

[15:43:11] <horseface> since i am using wayland...
[15:43:14] <matthewcroughan> Foxboron: a fair criticism, but at least I can figure out how something got added.
[15:43:17] <Foxboron> This isn't a "my way" thing, this is all about compromise and what the goals are.
[15:43:28] <matthewcroughan> how/why something got in, and when it got in, literate programming basically
[15:43:51] <matthewcroughan> there is a story as to how something became, rather than it just existing in a broken state one day for no reason 
[15:44:03] <Foxboron> Why are all nixos users like this. I don't get it.
[15:44:06] <Foxboron> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[15:44:21] <matthewcroughan> Because I like having a working system that I understand why it broke, what changes were made upstream, etc.
[15:44:33] <Foxboron> We all have that.
[15:44:33] <matthewcroughan> like on Arch, I just upgraded my system one day, and my pam modules were all different
[15:44:45] <matthewcroughan> like I couldn't run dmesg, or journalctl the same way, because some arch maintainer made a decision for me
[15:44:52] <matthewcroughan> rolling that back isn't an option really either 
[15:45:10] <Foxboron> You can pull the package and build it yourself. That isn't a problem
[15:45:17] <matthewcroughan> yet if I explicitly say how I want the pam to be set up in Nix code for example, no maintainer can change that on me, but I still get the benefit of upstream maintainership
[15:45:18] <matthewcroughan> it's a nice thing
[15:45:28] <Foxboron> Ah here we go.
[15:45:45] <Foxboron> The nixos upsell!
[15:45:45] <matthewcroughan> if I say `pulseaudio.enable = true;` this doesn't implicitly enable pipewire.
[15:45:47] <matthewcroughan> but heyo

[16:00:41] <mpan> ivanhoe: you must build it yourself: <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gcc8/>. Note that you may need to **temporarily** remove some warning-errors from “/etc/makepkg.conf”, as they have been added much later and gcc that outdated may trigger the warnings.

[16:12:44] <MacGyver> I'll preface this by saying I don't know anything about DisplayLink.
[16:12:48] <horseface> "Furthermore, /dev should contain a new fb device, likely /dev/fb1 if you already had a framebuffer for your primary display."
[16:13:00] <horseface> yes, but you should know framebuffer...
[16:13:36] <horseface> within my /dev folder there is only listed fb0 and nothing else...
[16:14:02] <MacGyver> Hmm. I've got two monitors running and also only got fb0, so maybe that's specific to DisplayLink?
