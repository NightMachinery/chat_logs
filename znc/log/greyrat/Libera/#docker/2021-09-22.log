[17:33:23] <dminuoso> Hi. Is there a quick and dirty way to extract a file from a docker image? I want to abuse `docker` as just a mechanism to build a statically linked ELF inside alpine.
[17:33:31] <dminuoso> Ideally I want to avoid ever creating a container
[17:33:54] <tabakhase> dminuoso use docker run to build then?
[17:34:16] <dminuoso> That would create a container.
[17:34:35] <dminuoso> I mean if I *have* to its fine, just wondering whether I could avoid it
[17:35:39] <tabakhase> also "docker run --rm thing cat file > file" will 'extract'  (could be a tar-pipe instead of cat for multiple files) - ive also seen bindmounts and then a "docker run mv/cp" - and obvs. first class "docker cp" command  (all with the "needs a container" hook kinda)
[17:36:07] <tabakhase> getting the "needs a container" removed is kinda impossible too, as it needs to assemble the onion-filesystem to even get to the files... 
[17:37:06] <dminuoso> Very well, Il luse `docker run --rm` then
[17:37:08] <dminuoso> Thank you, tabakhase.
[17:37:14] <tabakhase> and "creating a container to build" shouldnt be an issue uh? --- idea is "docker run -v src:/in/ -v result:/out/ compile -i /in -o /out"
[17:39:16] <tabakhase> as in, no "docker build" at all  (or well maybe one, to build the initial compiler image ;-))

[17:43:22] <dminuoso> tabakhase: Not sure what that "docker run -v src:/in/ ..." line is supposed to mean, but if you're telling me that it's not possible to exfiltrate a file without a container, that's perfectly fine.

[17:45:26] <tabakhase> dminuoso uh? sr, no clue where you stand with docker :D -- "-v" are volumes(that live in docker) OR can also be bind-mounts, what exposes your host-dir to the container directly -- so imagine im in a folder with some html files, instead of "building" i could run "docker run -v $PWD:/var/www -p 80:80 nginx" and get a webserver to just press F5 to see my changes instead (so no need to rebuild)

[17:46:00] <dminuoso> tabakhase: No I understand, it just didnt seem to make sense given the prior lines you've written

[17:46:30] <dminuoso> it's precisely what this is about
[17:47:19] <dminuoso> Sadly Ulrich Drepper forced this story on me, since the only reasonable way to create a statically linked ELF binary outside of nix is in a musl based distro, and docker gives me the fastest road to that goal.

[21:09:04] <programmerq> I would never recommend putting any sort of environment-specific logic into a Dockerfile. Instead, write a Dockerfile that has the software needed to run in any environment, and provide any runtime specific configuration at runtime (via env vars, config files, etc)

[22:24:40] <PanickedKernel> Hi all. This might be a dumb noob question but... I have a few applications that are provided as docker images. A few of these images come with nginx. So now I have multiple nginx serves running. The same goes for databases. Is it possible to have a "main" nginx/database running and tell the application images to use those?
[22:24:59] <PanickedKernel> It just seems like I'm wasting resources running multiple instances.

[22:27:31] <programmerq> you can certainly reconfigure the applications you're running to use common resources. I wouldn't bother for nginx-- it's quite lean.
[22:27:47] <programmerq> there's a better case do combine database servers in my opinion
[22:28:18] <programmerq> but remember that a big part of the benefits you get from containerization is isolation so that changes on project A don't affect project B.
[22:28:34] <programmerq> if those two now share a resource, then one has a higher ability to affect the other.

[23:31:58] <ada_> I don't think there's anything specific to docker that would "help" with that problem
[23:32:22] <ada_> you'd basically take a dump of the tables in Database1 and them import them into database2, repeat for all databases
[23:32:34] <ada_> that is mostly the DB interface, docker doesn't really do anything to help with that process
[23:33:36] <ada_> if you have a port published for your database, just use your database client to do an import on whatever tables you want to import
