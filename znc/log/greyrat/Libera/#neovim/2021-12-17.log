[12:52:17] <AtBios[m]> I was told this was the place I could ask for some help with nvim-lsp, is this actually correct? I was told about this like a day ago, so this chat is actully totally new to me. :) 
[12:52:35] <dumbdemic[m]> what is a good way to run the output of `echo printf('eslint --fix %s', expand('%:p'))` as a system command?
[12:52:52] <eyalk11eyalk11[m> I have a function for this.

[13:02:09] <vigoux> AtBios[m]: isn't netcat just one-way ?
[13:02:36] <clason[m]> Make sure you are actually in a Godot project
[13:02:53] <AtBios[m]> I don't know to be honest. I tried without netcat and that always gave me "no cmd exe found"
[13:02:54] <clason[m]> https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md#gdscript
[13:02:56] <AtBios[m]> And I'm in the project. 
[13:03:07] <clason[m]> does it work from the command line?
[13:03:25] <vigoux> Did you try searching "server address" in the docs ?
[13:03:51] <AtBios[m]> I don't know from the command line actually, I ran nc localhost 6008 and that gave no error so the server "ran". 
[13:04:06] <AtBios[m]> And I got it working with COC, but I just can't get it working with NVIM-LSP. 
[13:04:18] <vigoux> Yeah but that's not how thing go
[13:04:41] <vigoux> WIth netcat you can only get what the lsp sends you but can't request
[13:04:50] <AtBios[m]> I mean, I'm 100% this is me being bad at it. So I'm literally looking for any help to get it working. 
[13:05:11] <vigoux> I would use telnet rather that netcat
[13:05:28] <vigoux> Do you have a telnet equivalent on windows ?

[13:07:32] <AtBios[m]> Thanks! That I wasn't aware of. 
[13:07:51] <vigoux> Can you tell me if you have telnet on windows ?
[13:09:21] <AtBios[m]> Looks like you can turn it on from what I'm reading. - https://phoenixnap.com/kb/telnet-windows
[13:09:30] <AtBios[m]> So looks like it.
[13:10:08] <vigoux> So, open a terminal
[13:10:17] <vigoux> Type `telnet` in it and hit enter
[13:10:26] <vigoux> Then tell me what this tells you
[13:12:01] <AtBios[m]> I jumped into Microsoft Telnet with the text "Welcome to Microsoft Telnet Client". 
[13:12:26] <AtBios[m]> so here I guess I need to run the Godot command? E.g. Localhost and the port. To "access" it? 
[13:13:03] <AtBios[m]> One second testing this
[13:13:10] <vigoux> wut
[13:13:33] <vigoux> Why not using https://github.com/williamboman/nvim-lsp-installer though ?
[13:13:39] <vigoux> That may help you a lot !
[13:13:53] <AtBios[m]> I have that one instealled.

[13:33:03] <sunjonSenghanBri> if you have a working lspconfig setup, you only need the `gdscript` string in the servers list that you create on_attach handlers for
[13:33:55] <sunjonSenghanBri> the telnet pic looks like it's doing nothing, did you start the server manually (for this test)?
[13:34:03] <AtBios[m]> Yeah, I did.
[13:34:33] <AtBios[m]> And I didn't get it working by just "calling" the gdscript in the LSP. :(
[13:34:39] <sunjonSenghanBri> and it shows as listening in `netstat -tulpn` ? (not sure if windows knows all those flags... try `aof` or google if not)
[13:34:40] <AtBios[m]> That is where my issue is.
[13:34:56] <sunjonSenghanBri> and you've checked the lsp logs?
[13:37:07] <AtBios[m]> WHere can I find the logs?

[13:38:59] <sunjonSenghanBri> did you check to see if there's a listening socket?
[13:39:03] <sunjonSenghanBri> on 6008?
[13:39:27] <sunjonSenghanBri> if telnet can't connect, then LSP wouldn't
[13:39:39] <AtBios[m]> Do you know how to check that? 
[13:39:57] <sunjonSenghanBri> try the netstat command I posted a few lines above

[13:42:26] <AtBios[m]> That's what i get with netstat
[13:43:02] <sunjonSenghanBri> yeah, I said. Google for "listening sockets netstat windows" to find the correct parameters
[13:43:27] <AtBios[m]> Sorru!
[13:43:32] <AtBios[m]> Somehow missed.

[13:44:27] <sunjonSenghanBri> the path separators on your netcat command are the wrong ones, no?

[13:48:54] <AtBios[m]> FOr windows that is the correct one, if I do the other seperator, it breaks because that is a "cancel" out

[22:25:12] <chipps_> Hello there
[22:26:33] <chipps_> suppose I paste some text into the current buffer from somewhere else. How can I best go into visual mode with that text in the selection?
[22:27:21] <chipps_> I want something like 'gv', but for last pasted text. Or maybe put the last pasted text as the region which gv stores.
[22:31:38] <luisiaccLuisCC[m> How can I disable nvim-cmp completion in a filetype?
[22:35:02] <LyndsySimon> I'm a bit confused this morning. I have my editor mostly configured how I'd like it - using 0.7.0-dev, LSP is working, my project is using pyright, and I'm using coq_nvim for completions and such. What I don't have is code folding, and I'm not sure why. :(
[22:35:47] <clason[m]> in such cases, the answer is almost always "treesitter"
[22:36:18] <LyndsySimon> Yeah, I figured. I'm just having a hard time getting my head wrapped around things on this cold, rainy Friday I suppose.
[22:36:50] <clason[m]> https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter#folding
[22:37:30] <clason[m]> (if you use tree-sitter based highlighting, all syntax features are disabled. you'll have to enable tree-sitter based folding as well, then)
[22:37:43] <LyndsySimon> Huh. I'm both enlightened and more confused now. I don't appear to have it installed at the moment - which is weird, because as recently as Tuesday I was working on a grammar for plantuml files
[22:38:17] <LyndsySimon> I've obviously messed with my config too much lately.
[22:38:36] <clason[m]> it does sound like it, if even you can't tell ;)
[22:39:48] <LyndsySimon> Especially ironic since I embarked on a refactor a couple of weeks ago to make my config more understandable. I bet I removed it when I started leaning more heavily into LSP-based features, because I didn't realize that code folding was the only feature I was no longer using.
[22:41:40] <mjlbach[m]> We don't support LSP based code folding yet
[22:41:41] <mjlbach[m]> https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/14306
[22:41:49] <LyndsySimon> Ahhh.
[22:42:59] <LyndsySimon> It's frustrating to me that I obviously have the skill and aptitude to help with this stuff, but lack the consistency and attention span.
[22:43:10] <mjlbach[m]> I don't use folds so I never looked into this, but there is the comment by theHamsta (Stephan Seitz) https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/14306#issuecomment-814806855
[22:43:11] <LyndsySimon> The blessings and curses  of ADHD I suppose.

[23:19:52] <LyndsySimon> Could someone confident of their knowledge of Neovim, Lua, and packer take a quick look at my root plugins config file and let me know if anything jumps out to them as either a problem or something that could be improved? https://git.sr.ht/~lyndsysimon/dotfiles/tree/main/item/nvim/lua/plugins.lua
[23:21:20] <LyndsySimon> Specifically, the way I'm using Packer's `config=` parameter to conditionally load pre-plugin config files from a subdirectory. That seems to have worked well for me and allowed me to keep things in their "proper place", but I'm not confident enough in my own context to know if it's the "Right Way (TM)"

[23:22:15] <clason[m]> _pre_load config goes in `setup`, not `config` (which is run after loading)
[23:23:04] <LyndsySimon> Ahhh, OK. Thanks :). I think that applies to everything I have currently happening in `config`, but will need to review each one to make sure.

[23:26:13] <LyndsySimon> Hmm. Most of my files that I'm including through `config` start with `require('<plugin>')` - that doesn't work before the plugin is loaded.
[23:26:49] <clason[m]> yes, I was specifically replying to your "pre-pluign config"
[23:26:54] <clason[m]> s/yes, I was specifically replying to your "pre-pluign config"/yes, I was specifically replying to your "pre-plugin config files"/
[23:27:57] <LyndsySimon> Ah, OK. I may have phrased that incorrectly - but your comment has brought my attention to the existence of `setup` and the differences between it and `config`. I'll review my config and make sure I'm using the right parameters in the right way.
