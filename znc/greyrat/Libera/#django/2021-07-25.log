[15:28:42] <GinFuyou> dnns01, have to do it manually I guess
[15:38:25] <dnns01> Ok, so I already created a form that is not a model form for one part of my configuration. But I guess I used the wrong way to get the data from Database in there. I set in my form class while specifiing the fields, their initial parameter to the values from the database, using Setting.objects.get(key="KEY").value which worked while using the form, but it created problems for example when I tried to migrate the database, when those keys have not
[15:38:25] <dnns01> been specified already. Is there an easier solution?
[15:40:03] <GinFuyou> It's wrong solution, don't make DB calls at module level
[15:40:21] <GinFuyou> It will just break in next deploy
[15:40:33] <dnns01> Do you have link for me with the right solution?
[15:42:37] <GinFuyou> No, I don't know what you were trying to do exactly. Possibly use form's __init__() method?
[15:44:24] <hylje> using "Setting.objects.get(key="KEY")" type stuff is fine as long as you keep it inside function scope (views and such) and don't need it at module loading time
[15:44:47] <hylje> as using the database in django requires successfully loading django itself and also running migrations, both of which may involve importing your modules
[15:46:44] <dnns01> What I am trying to do: That should be the webinterface for a bot with different "modules". Each Module should be configurable, for example turn it on or off, set a sleep duration for a loop. And the solution I came up with to accomplish that was, to have a Settings model that contains key value pairs.

[23:35:19] <Steve-Dusty> Guys
[23:35:34] <Steve-Dusty> I want to get the question  with the highest amount of vote
[23:35:57] <Steve-Dusty> `top_choices = Choice.objects.get(
[23:35:57] <Steve-Dusty>         pk=question_id).aggregate(Max('votes')).get('votes__max')`
[23:35:59] <Steve-Dusty> why doesnt this work
[23:37:18] <Steve-Dusty> https://dpaste.org/jhK0 here
[23:39:41] <ChrisWarrick> Steve-Dusty: The 'get' method returns exactly one Choice object. You’re also looking for a Choice based on the question ID (or at least that’s what your variable names say).
[23:40:50] <ChrisWarrick> Steve-Dusty: Assuming the polls tutorial, you probably want Choice.objects.filter(question=question_id) — and then you can aggregate on it
[23:44:17] <Steve-Dusty> ph
[23:44:18] <Steve-Dusty> oh
[23:45:14] <Steve-Dusty> what if you choices have the same amount of votes?
[23:45:24] <Steve-Dusty> idk how to check
[23:45:48] <Steve-Dusty> if top_choices > 1 ?
[23:48:19] <ChrisWarrick> If you don’t have too many choices, I’d just get the votes ordered, and find the maximum in python code
[23:49:48] <Steve-Dusty> Im getting it ordered
[23:49:59] <Steve-Dusty> but I also want to display the leader..
[23:50:03] <Steve-Dusty> i don't know what to do..
[23:50:17] <Steve-Dusty> if there's more than 1 than don't display?
[23:50:22] <Steve-Dusty> or display it all?
[23:50:24] <ChrisWarrick> maybe
[23:50:26] <Steve-Dusty> it's confuzzling
[23:50:27] <ChrisWarrick> it’s up to you
[23:50:47] <Steve-Dusty> what'd be the best UX?
[23:50:48] <Steve-Dusty> what'd be the best UX?
[23:50:57] <Steve-Dusty> i didnt know up arrow creates the back message
[23:50:58] <ChrisWarrick> depends what you’re voting on, really
[23:52:12] <Steve-Dusty> ChrisWarrick I use arch too
[23:52:21] <ChrisWarrick> Steve-Dusty: (I don’t really.)
[23:54:38] *** Quits: EvilDMP (~textual@django/moderator/EvilDMP) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[23:58:59] <Steve-Dusty> https://dpaste.org/37oG I want my template to only get leader if less than 2 choices or not more than 1 choice
[23:59:21] <Steve-Dusty> i meant don't duplicate leaders*
[23:59:33] <Steve-Dusty> so don't display if 2 top people have the same amount of votes
[23:59:51] <Steve-Dusty> do I use choice_set for this?
