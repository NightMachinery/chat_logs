[20:17:16] <pystardust> SurajKushwah[m]: we found a fix to bypass captcha. But now that mental outlaw made this script popular its a matter of time that gogoanime learns a way to avoid it
[20:22:31] <relejek[m]> pystardust: gogoanime has captcha?  Nobody Told me about this. And here I am using it just fine.
[20:22:49] <pystardust> relejek[m]: the download links section does
[20:23:12] <pystardust> if we need to play it on mpv (not stream it via webplayer) then you mostly need captcha
[20:28:37] <relejek[m]> pystardust:  oh okay, I gotchu. yes, the download page has captcha.
[20:29:52] <relejek[m]> And how do you circumvent it? And what does mental outlaw has to do with it. üßê
