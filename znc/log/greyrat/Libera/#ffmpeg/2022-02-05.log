[01:06:45] <Lebela> like you would imagine fading out a video,  but I want to "blur it out"
[01:06:52] <furq> not trivially
[01:06:59] <furq> you could maybe hack something together with xfade
[01:07:42] <Lebela> furq, given that I am not proficient when it comes to "hacking something together",  would you advice me to use imagemagick instead?
[01:08:06] <Lebela> furq, I could export every single frame as a picture, and then use imagemagick to add blur gradually more and more for every pic
[01:08:20] <Lebela> and then I could put it back together using "ffmpeg" to make all the pictures (frames) into a video again
[01:08:29] <Lebela> sounds overkill, but... why not?
[01:08:53] <Lebela> furq, however, if you know a pure ffmpeg solution, I would love to hear it
[01:09:24] <Lebela> furq, there are quite many such questions online (stackoverflow,  ffmpeg mailing list)  but no answers
[01:10:02] <furq> -lavfi "[0:v]split=2[norm][tmp];[tmp]boxblur[blurred];[norm][blurred]xfade=duration=1.5:offset=60"
[01:10:05] <furq> something like that
[01:10:21] <Lebela> oh, furq, thank you!
[01:10:26] <Lebela> are you a developer?
[01:10:35] <Lebela> you seem to have way more insight into this than I
[01:10:46] <furq> not of ffmpeg
[01:10:54] <Lebela> furq, thank you so much for that command
[01:11:01] <Lebela> am I allowed to ask questions in regards to it?
[01:11:04] <furq> sure
[01:11:14] <Lebela> thank you!  If I ask too much, please tell me
[01:11:27] <Lebela> why the offset of 60?  Should I adjust this to reflect my video?
[01:11:37] <furq> that's the start time in seconds
[01:11:40] <Lebela> why the ";" between the two [tmp] ?
[01:12:15] <furq> https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#Filtergraph-syntax-1
[01:12:22] <Lebela> thank you!
[01:12:28] <Lebela> furq, please allow me to test the command
[01:12:32] <Lebela> I will get back to you ASAP

[01:19:05] <Lebela> maybe I am expecting too much of a blur?  The video might be a little bit blurry

[01:19:18] *** Joins: JEEB (~jeeb@kuroko.fushizen.eu)
[01:19:22] <Lebela> can we make it like really blurry at the end?
[01:20:45] <furq> you can change the boxblur arguments or use a different blur filter
[01:21:09] <furq> https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#boxblur or avgblur, dblur, gblur, unsharp, etc
[01:21:26] <Lebela> there seem to be numbers, too
[01:21:26] <Lebela> boxblur=10
[01:21:29] <Lebela> is that okay?
[01:21:31] <furq> sure
[01:21:39] <Lebela> thank you so much!
[01:22:42] <Lebela> furq, where would the number go in the line you gave me?
[01:22:53] <Lebela> should I replace [blurred] ?  (2 occurances)
[01:25:05] <furq> [tmp]boxblur=10[blurred]
[01:25:59] <Lebela> thank you!  I actually even tried that,  but I was afraid it was too much of a lucky guess on my part

[01:37:35] <Lebela> furq, can I get your help one last time for now?
[01:37:47] <Lebela> the blur-animation works smoothly.
[01:37:49] <Lebela> thank you for that
[01:37:55] <Lebela> there is just one thing that I would like to change about it
[01:38:15] <Lebela> The full blur or "10" only shows at the very last moment
[01:38:22] <Lebela> but I need to write some text into the blurred video
[01:38:53] <Lebela> is it possible to... let's say gradually blur the first 4 seconds,  and then keep the same blur level of "10" for another 3 seconds?
[01:39:12] <Lebela> so, gradually for 4 seconds,  non-gradually for another 3 seconds?
[01:39:17] <furq> that's what that does
[01:39:35] <Lebela> oh... I should not have cut out a 4-seconds chunk of the video then
[01:39:39] <Lebela> sorry, stupid me
[01:39:47] <Lebela> I did not realize that, as I worked on a 4-seconds piece
[01:39:48] <Lebela> sorry
[01:40:28] <Lebela> I am re-running the test with a 15 seconds piece now to see what happens

[01:53:31] <Lebela> why are they using an offset of 4.5 ?
[01:53:49] <Lebela> shouldn't a crossfade be between the end of video A and the start of video B ?

[02:01:48] <Lebela> so, in my case, if the video were 1 hour long,  and I wanted the transition to be 10 seconds, I would transition from 00:55:00 onwards?
[02:02:01] <Lebela> can ffmpeg figure out the end of the video itself?
[02:02:19] <furq> it's the timestamp in the first video where you want the fade to start
[02:02:22] <Lebela> because I have many videos that I am going to be concatenating and manually calculating the time is one too many steps
[02:02:27] <furq> so i guess 59:55
[02:02:56] <Lebela> I will try it with two 20-seconds clips just to see how it looks

[02:09:12] <Lebela> do you guys think,  that crossfading between different camera angles is even good?
[02:09:27] <Lebela> imagine you have a video of a speaker at a conference, and there are 3 camera angles
[02:09:32] <Lebela> a) from the front
[02:09:36] <Lebela> b) from the left side
[02:09:54] <Lebela> c) from the top downwards (not totally straight downwards,  slightly slanted)
[02:10:14] <Lebela> should the cuts between the camera angles be clear and immediate, or with a 2-3 seconds crossfade?

[02:18:12] <Lebela> I was thinking about extracting the last frame as a picture, and then creating a 3 seconds video clip with a still image
[02:18:20] <Lebela> is this the best way?  (I could do this myself)
[02:18:26] <Lebela> or is there a better ffmpeg-way to do it?
[02:18:48] <znf> You can do a lot with ffmpeg filters, but there's a certain point where piling on top of -filter_complex becomes detrimental and hard to maintain
[02:19:32] <Lebela> znf:  Thank you for chiming in
[02:19:49] <Lebela> znf, so, should I just export the last frame as a picture and make a video from it?

[14:22:52] <panella32> Any idea?
[14:23:18] <JEEB> too old binary?
[14:23:33] <panella32> Let me check the version pls
[14:23:36] <JEEB> ffmpeg -filters |find "delogo"
[14:23:47] <JEEB> https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases/tag/latest
[14:24:01] <panella32> ffmpeg version N-105193-g2b541b8c1d-20220106 Copyright (c) 2000-2022
[14:24:01] <JEEB> you can grab the latest master or so from here
[14:26:19] <JEEB> that definitely should be new enough so it could just be disabled in  your build, can't say much more.
[14:30:38] <panella32> Thank you so much JEEB. Downloaded the latest binary from that link and now it's working fine.
[14:31:35] <panella32> Although it's kinda slow. I wish there was a way to cover a logo without re-encoding..
[14:33:15] <panella32> <time=00:03:42.17 bitrate=1330.9kbits/s speed=1.14x> they are 20 clips and running time of each around 45 minutes!

[14:44:57] <panella32> JEEB Actually I'm going to upload them on yt and for some reason as unlisted videos :)
[14:45:17] <JEEB> well yea, then you'll have to re-encode
[14:46:00] <JEEB> btw, before you get too far. I recommend checking how the removelogo filter works compared to delogo
[14:47:04] <JEEB> the removelogo filter contains a comment "It is a major improvement on the old delogo filter as it both uses a better blurring algorithm and uses a bitmap to use an arbitrary and generally much tighter fitting shape than a rectangle"
[14:47:23] <panella32> Oh sure! I'll check out that one too. Hopefully it works fine for me and a bit faster!
[14:48:17] <panella32> Thanks again for all your replies.

[14:49:15] <mrvr> Is it possible to add a large text file, such as a json file, into an mp4 as metadata?
[14:52:09] *** Joins: bencc1 (~bencc1@2a00:a040:197:3af:609a:bb94:28f9:7f6f)
[14:53:47] <JEEB> mrvr: I would probably check if any specification already defines what exactly you're trying to do
[14:54:27] <JEEB> but there are generic metadata bits in mp4 where you could in theory hack up a box for your use :P
[14:55:39] *** Joins: __Myst__ (~Myst@net-47-53-171-76.cust.vodafonedsl.it)
[14:55:47] <JEEB> in any case, you should probably see what it is you are actually trying to save within that JSON structure, and then figure out whether such things are already defined :P (including having the things as proper structures or just normal metadata keys and values)
[14:56:39] *** Quits: ___Myst___ (~Myst@net-130-25-42-216.cust.vodafonedsl.it) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[14:56:54] <mrvr> What’s in the json doesn’t really matter.
[14:57:39] <JEEB> I'm just thinking of the case if there are proper defined metadata things for the data within that JSON :P
[14:57:46] <mrvr> There are things like “description” metadata tags that can be set in ffmpeg. I’m curious if there is a limit to the length  / size.
[14:57:59] <JEEB> you don't want to do it as a key=value thing
[14:58:12] <JEEB> if you want a random json you probably want it in your own specific box
[14:58:22] *** Quits: ivanich (~ivanich@45-140-123-239.broadband.tenet.odessa.ua) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[14:58:27] <JEEB> not "your funky json"="{}"
[14:59:15] <JEEB> anyways, I would first figure out whether whatever you're trying to stick in there is already properly specified somewhere :P
[14:59:26] <mrvr> It isn’t.
[15:00:03] <mrvr> Besides the subtitle track, can a text document be embedded into an mp4 file?
[15:00:32] <mrvr> Or is metadata the only way?
[15:00:35] <JEEB> you define your own box and define its contents as being something?
[15:01:26] <mrvr> What is this box you’re referring to? A custom metadata tag?
[15:01:37] <JEEB> box is what mp4 consists of
[15:01:46] <JEEB> four bytes of size, four bytes of identifier
[15:01:49] <JEEB> and then the data
[15:01:59] <JEEB> like how an mp4 document starts, with an ftyp box
[15:02:34] <JEEB> requires of course writing extra code to write and read that out :P
[15:03:09] <mrvr> So….. I’m not sure I understand your answer. It is possible to create a custom mp4 box and add text information?
[15:03:45] <JEEB> but yea I think I see people adding timed metadata into their own tracks etc, I think there's some location XML in timed samples etc
[15:03:58] <JEEB> but if your stuff is not timed then that's not really required
[15:05:00] <mrvr> I would be adding this information once video recording has stopped, not during recording.
[15:05:44] <mrvr> Is there an example of doing what you’re describing in the ffmpeg documentation?
[15:06:06] <JEEB> also I must say that since JSON is key-value storage it is really weird that you're trying to not utilize any key-value storages
[15:06:17] <JEEB> within the container that is :P
[15:07:19] <mrvr> There will be hundreds of key:value pairs in this text document
[15:07:55] <JEEB> boxes adding requires coding, I recently added support for DASH CMAF stream roles http://git.videolan.org/?p=ffmpeg.git;a=blobdiff;f=libavformat/movenc.c;h=d43a086f4b684533f9cd2ce2bdebf3b982379119;hp=1a2f24c410fffe83c29c066848cc943282fdf2ae;hb=7a446b1179301b6b9d05a7d39574e75e8fa5a862;hpb=847fd8de7c13abe41ca59464014f17c56555ef7b
[15:08:46] <JEEB> anyways, if you're looking for not writing custom code then you could (ab)use the key=value metadata stuff
[15:09:14] <JEEB> you will most likely hit a limit of the command line terminal you're using quicker than the API's
[15:09:20] <mrvr> There is also the task of extracting and reading this embedded mp4 data via JavaScript, etc.
[15:10:45] <JEEB> anyways, people have defined plenty of metadata into MP4-likes via 3GPP, DASH etc
[15:10:58] <JEEB> might as well take a look generally if someone has specified something you're trying to do
[15:11:09] <JEEB> if someone has, might make sense to implement that
[15:11:13] <mrvr> ok, thanks JEEB.

[23:55:15] <fkaa> maybe dumb question, are audio packets from eg. AAC, Opus able to be decoded independently from other packets? (keyframes)
[23:56:11] <JEEB> if the packet is flagged as such, yes. there are some compressed audio formats like Meridian Lossless/TrueHD which have actual predicting frames that require references :)
