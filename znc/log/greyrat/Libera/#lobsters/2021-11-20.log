[05:21:12] <feoh> I don't think Go is ugly, my brain just rebels at its lack of abstraction *by choice*
[05:21:23] <feoh> I can't grok why you'd choose that for what is effectively a gc language.
[05:21:48] <feoh> Rust I get. You're getting lightning fast execution speed and no memory management overhead unless you choose that (e.g. refcounting)
[05:21:52] <feoh> Go I do not get.
[05:23:12] <feoh> But that's just me and my personal hang-ups :)
[05:24:27] <technomancy> wait but like ... rust has parametric types?
[05:24:36] <technomancy> it's not an efficiency thing at all
[05:24:46] <technomancy> it's 100% a "refuses to do the reading before coming to class" thing
[05:47:46] <companion_cube> rust has generics and sum types
[05:47:57] <companion_cube> it's therefore a lot more friendly to abstraction than Go :p

[06:12:53] <zbrown[m]> feoh:  because it’s actually nice to debug a low abstraction language at 3am when doing incident response. The code is verbose and wildly boring. There are no surprises.
[06:13:27] <zbrown[m]> Go is a boring and mundane programming experience. But it’s a good devops 3am experience. As good as one of those ever is
[06:14:32] <zbrown[m]> I don’t particularly like go but I would choose it over basically any dynamically typed language given my past experience.

[17:30:23] <albertito> it depends on what you are worried about. If you're worried about the game being poorly written and *accidentally* deleting your files or uploading something they shouldn't, then chroot or docker is okay. If you think it may be actively malicious or crafted to exploit you, then just don't run it on a machine you care about

[23:28:21] <aja> oh yeah it was definitely Mendeley, although 10 years ago :)
[23:29:03] <aja> when you say "manage", what do you mean exactly? by far my biggest problem is search these days
[23:29:03] <drobilla> Yeah.  Mendeley is quite good at doing what it's for, though it's unfortunately proprietary and overly cloudey

[23:29:44] <drobilla> Maybe it's not that cloudey for the actual documents.  I forget TBH

[23:58:28] <drobilla> You sort of have to learn how to be careful with it
[23:59:11] <drobilla> and some of its flaws have network effects!  Like, it will just convert whatever to whatever _and forget which is the canonical source_.  So when you find ebooks that are only some mangled converted thing, that's usually why
