[17:24:57] <konubinix> rdrg109: Can you write what you are asking? My irc client restarted and I don't have the logs of this chan
[20:31:08] <rdrg109> konubinix: Yes. I asked you if you could share your configuration for storing nodes metadata (number of visits, date of creation, last modification date) in redis.
[22:43:56] <konubinix> I'm sorry, I store only the number of visits in redis
[22:44:40] <konubinix> I actually don't mind having the other metadata in the file so far
[22:46:56] <konubinix> rdrg109: If update the number of visits using this code
[22:47:01] <konubinix> https://github.com/Konubinix/Devel/blob/master/elfiles/config/after-loads/KONIX_AL-org-roam.el#L671
[22:49:34] <konubinix> About the other properties, I did not feel the need to store them outside of the buffer
[22:51:08] <konubinix> Even the mast modif√Øcation date is ok to be stored in the buffer because by definition it is updated when the buffer is modified and then parsed again anyway
[22:51:47] <konubinix> Do you have some use case in mind needind to put those data ouside of the org buffer
[22:54:13] <konubinix> About my setup, you can see that I store the property using konix/org-redis-set-property, that itself uses konix/redis-hset that finally simply calls the redis-cli program (call-process "redis-cli" nil nil nil "hset" key name value)
[22:54:22] <konubinix> See https://github.com/Konubinix/Devel/blob/master/elfiles/config/300-KONIX_functions.el#L1418
[22:55:12] <konubinix> I created those functions because I wanted to store the number of visits and it works well so far
[23:01:18] <konubinix> That makes me think that I should want the prefix the redis key with something uniq, like org-id-, so as to ease cleaning the base in the future
