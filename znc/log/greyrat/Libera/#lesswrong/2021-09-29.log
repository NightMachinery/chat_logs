[00:12:38] <two2thehead> , Baron-Cohen asserts, sits firmly at the male end of this continuum."

[00:35:15] <galambo_> for car enthusiasts. I dont drive. I enjoyed go-karting when I did it recently (and I actually ranked surprisingly well considering I dont drive). do you guys reckon buying something like a mazda mx5 na is worth it for me?
[00:36:01] <galambo_> I live close to work and uber everywhere
[00:36:12] <galambo_> walk to work
[00:38:11] <gwern> what's wrong with like a vr racing game

[00:38:32] <nshepperd> Obormot\Gaia: ahah
[00:38:35] <nshepperd> very nice
[00:38:38] <ggreer> wouldn't you get tons of motion sickness from VR racing games?
[00:39:03] <gwern> saturn2: in circles, one assumes
[00:40:11] <nshepperd> galambo_: that sounds like a very ridiculous thing to buy if you don't drive
[00:40:26] <ggreer> yeah even a cheap miata is what, $6k?
[00:40:48] <ggreer> you could get a pilot's license for that much money
[00:41:00] <kuudes> flying is surprisingly cheap
[00:41:00] <galambo_> nshepperd, yes thats a very logical conclusion of what I said
[00:41:40] <kuudes> over here sailplane theory training is some 400 e and then those flying hours are a couple of thousands per couple of tens of hours
[00:41:50] <ggreer> pretty much every time I go to the grocery store there's a 3rd gen nissan skyline GT-R parked in front. it's right hand drive. I have no idea how someone managed to import it and get it declared street legal

[00:42:47] <galambo_> maybe VR racing games are more practical I guess. cheaper. low maintenance. entertaining. competitive. bit awkward though. like I can tell people I dont drive. then they ask me my hobbies and I go driving sims
[00:43:05] <kuudes> I suppose a engined plane pilot's licence and access to a plane would be much more useful in uk than in finland, as one could take trips to netherlands, belgium, germany, france and maybe denmark quite easily

[00:45:48] <adiabatic> not really. if you're switching from a jalopy to a normal car that's not cringe
[00:47:02] <galambo_> nshepperd, I agree. I hate status and I try to find subtle ways to mock people who seek status.

[00:48:39] <shawwwn> you use <wbr>?
[00:49:15] <galambo_> catern, sure. I was just thinking about this particular car because its cheap and has good handling similar to a go kart
[00:50:03] <ggreer> practical? GTRs need lots of maintenance
[00:50:12] <ggreer> twin turbos don't just stay in working order
[00:50:19] <galambo_> momus, well if they have a nice watch/car/house in relation to their income they are definitely seeking status
[00:50:32] <gwern> shawwwn: yeah, for '/' mostly
[00:51:04] <momus> galambo_: lol
[00:51:12] <galambo_> ggreer, I didnt do much research to be honest. but its a nissan and its faster what its price suggests.
[00:51:27] <nshepperd> galambo_: well the based move is to just not care that people think it's awkward to play racing sims instead of wasting money on a pointless car
[00:51:28] <galambo_> and doesnt looks like a supercar or anything
[00:51:46] <momus> i'd rather have a gtr than a california.
[00:51:53] <momus> think everyone knows it's a supercar.
[00:52:10] <galambo_> nshepperd, yes also probably cheaper and more fun. a good vr setup is like £££
[00:54:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hmm, well, I guess my face is shaved... I can't say that I love this device but it does the job adequately
[00:54:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Let's see how long it lasts I guess...
[00:55:02] <ggreer> my favorite car is my model 3 performance, but sometimes I do miss the simplicity of my miata. the miata was ridiculously unsafe though
[00:55:06] <nshepperd> "an adequate shave for an adequate man"
[00:55:21] <galambo_> Obormot\Arcturus, if I want a razor clean shave with electric, I shave with a trimmer then top up with my braun series 9
[00:55:22] <nshepperd> I'll send that in to their marketing dept
[00:55:34] <ggreer> also I had way more people say "nice car" about miata than about my tesla
[00:55:49] <otoburb> galambo_: Isn't it difficult to figure out somebody's income unless you've known them for long enough? 
[00:55:54] <galambo_> ggreer, yes very low on the ground means poor visibility
[00:56:01] <galambo_> for you and other people
[00:56:17] <galambo_> and the car seems to be too small and not built to survive an accident
[00:56:21] <ggreer> galambo_: I mean just crash safety. it was a tin can from 1996. teslas are insanely safe
[00:57:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> galambo_: Nah, I don't care about getting a "clean shave". If I really want that I'll just use my safety razor, which does the job better than any electric
[00:58:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> My use case for this is just trimming, I don't like the feel of having a beard longer than a couple mm
[00:58:17] <galambo_> ah cool

We believe the unique combination of passive safety, active safety, and automated driver assistance is crucial for keeping not just Tesla drivers and passengers safe, but all drivers on the road. …)
[00:59:15] <galambo_> ggreer, we had a discussion about this before. I still believe that volvos are safer, simply because they are not gaming the system: https://danluu.com/car-safety/
[00:59:16] <Robomot> How do cars fare in crash tests they're not specifically optimized for?
[00:59:27] <galambo_> (but yes you did make criticisms of the article)
[00:59:30] <ggreer> they're so safe that the media has to make up incidents. eg: https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391890/tesla-driverless-crash-texas-nhtsa-investigation
[00:59:32] <Robomot> Feds investigating fatal Tesla crash where no one was in the driver seat - The Verge (The fatal crash involving a Tesla vehicle with no one in the driver’s seat is now under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The crash, which killed two men, took place in Texas.)
[01:00:55] <ggreer> https://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/Pages/NR20210510.aspx turns out there's video footage of the guy getting into the drivers seat, then flooring it
[01:00:56] <Robomot> NTSB Issues Preliminary Report for Fatal, Texas, Tesla Crash
[01:01:51] <ggreer> also it's not possible to engage autopilot on that street
[01:02:41] <galambo_> ggreer, wasnt there an article about someone seen sleeping while driving their tesla?
[01:03:44] <ggreer> yeah. sometimes people go unconscious while autopilot is on. eg: have a stroke. pass out. whatever
[01:04:39] <ggreer> but I don't know why danluu is saying volvos are safer. volvo, ford, and mazda all use the same car platforms. they differentiate based on branding, styling, and addon features
[01:05:17] <galambo_> I would rather be in a tesla if something like that happens
[01:05:51] <ggreer> if you go unconscious in a normal car, you drift into a barrier or opposing traffic, likely killing yourself and some innocent people
[01:06:30] <galambo_> ggreer, there is an appendix in the bottom
[01:10:35] <galambo_> I wouldnt buy a volvo. they have poor reliability and are not rated well by consumer reports. but then what do I know. I dont even drive.
[01:12:00] <catern> maybe you should just do go-karting more?
[01:12:23] <galambo_> catern, yes I think thats probably the logical conclusion. take an uber to go go karting.
[01:12:44] <galambo_> take an uber to a place where I can drive around in circles
[01:12:52] <catern> i'm anti-buying-a-car because i don't own a car and https://www.gwern.net/Holy-wars

[01:13:47] <catern> therefore I say: buying a car is cringe, don't do it
[01:13:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Cars are great and useful
[01:14:21] <catern> do you own a car Obormot?

[01:14:27] <catern> cringe
[01:14:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyone who says buying a car is cringe is just trying too hard to seem cool and make people who know how ti drive seem uncool

[01:14:48] <kuudes> I was surprised a person in nyc owns a car
[01:14:57] <ggreer> kuudes: he's the ultimate contrarian
[01:15:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Why?
[01:15:04] <ggreer> so of course he'd be a new yorker with a car
[01:15:08] <kuudes> indeed
[01:15:18] <ggreer> I really like my car. it goes really fast and it's quiet and it mostly drives itself. also it makes fart sounds
[01:15:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: You understand that like every street is NYC is lined with parked cars, right
[01:15:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> There are tons of New Yorkers with cars
[01:15:36] <ggreer> nobody drives in NYC. there's too much traffic
[01:15:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's not some weird thing
[01:15:40] <kuudes> Obormot\Arcturus, I would presume car parking places there cost a lot and public transit is goodish
[01:15:42] <galambo_> but like dont you have better things to do than change the oil and fill up the gas and pay your insurance and wash the car and all this mind-numbingly boring normie stuff?
[01:15:53] <galambo_> at least with electric there isnt much maintenance
[01:15:59] <ggreer> the only maintenance I've done in 15,000 miles is... add wiper fluid
[01:16:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: False and true, respectively
[01:16:23] <kuudes> galambo_, I have a car and I just take it to the shop when it says I need to
[01:16:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> galambo_: Paying insurance is just another bill. I pay other people to change the oil, when I take it in for inspection yearly. Wash the car? What, do I live in the Sahara? There's this thing called "rain"
[01:17:04] <kuudes> so twice a year I take it to get tires changed, and once or so per year I take it to scheduled repair, and once per year to roadworthiness certification
[01:17:29] <galambo_> and fill up the gas
[01:17:30] <kuudes> car wash automate is not terribly long
[01:17:31] <galambo_> and find parking
[01:17:34] <galambo_> and pay the parking
[01:17:37] <kuudes> indeed
[01:17:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't pay for parking
[01:17:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Don't be silly, guys
[01:17:47] <ggreer> tesla actually recommends smashing the brake pedal from time to time to make sure the brakes don't get rusty (usually you drive with one pedal and let regenerative braking do all the work)
[01:17:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> I park on the street, like most people
[01:17:58] <kuudes> usually parking for work is cheapish, and I have a place to store the car at home
[01:18:05] <catern> galambo_: exactly, it is mind-numbing boring normie stuff. they'll pretend it's not, but only because they're embarrassed
[01:18:11] <catern> and defensive
[01:18:13] <kuudes> I dislike street parking
[01:18:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nah
[01:18:35] <nshepperd> people should have to pay for parking but America is communist
[01:18:52] <galambo_> in egypt lots of cars get keyed and dinged if they are parked outside
[01:18:54] <kuudes> street parking is ok in low density areas, but otherwise it should be only for temporary use, ie paid parking
[01:18:57] <catern> i use my money to buy time, rather than spend my time on maintaining a car
[01:19:01] <catern> then I can use that time to argue about cars
[01:19:10] <catern> it's a no-brainer
[01:19:15] <galambo_> you guys are abusing a government subsidy
[01:19:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> galambo_: This is America, man. And NYC, to boot. I don't live in some third-world jungle like Detroit or w/e
[01:19:22] <kuudes> what subsidy?
[01:19:28] <galambo_> free parking
[01:19:44] <kuudes> as I said, I park at my yard or at work carage
[01:19:44] <catern> exactly, Obormot is a welfare queen
[01:20:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Finding a parking spot is sometimes a hassle (but if I lived in an apt. building with a parking garage or a private house, I wouldn't have to). Filling up the car with gas is a chore, though not a big one (I drive a Corolla; those are very fuel-efficient). But these two things are more than justified by the utility of having the car
[01:20:07] <kuudes> I like the underground parking cave here, even though or especially because it costs
[01:20:12] <nshepperd> no, the government is communist, they intend free parking to be abused
[01:20:27] <catern> do you have to do the street-cleaning shuffle Obormot?
[01:20:30] <kuudes> just drive under downtown at the place where you need to go shopping, take an elevator to the shop building and return the same way
[01:20:34] <kuudes> no need to expose to elements
[01:20:39] <ggreer> Even when it rains and my car is in a huge puddle, it’s still more fun than an Uber https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/lkPHzQrZ/IMG_3490.MP4
[01:20:43] <Robomot> video/mp4 (2.4 MB)
[01:20:54] <kuudes> but yeah, I hope to be able to switch to electric soon
[01:21:20] <kuudes> avoids much of car taxes when you also can just use house electricity for driving
[01:21:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: Yep
[01:21:30] <kuudes> car fuel is something like +300% taxed
[01:21:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: There's actually nothing wrong with exposing a car to the elements
[01:21:57] <kuudes> a loophole would be to have a generator to heat your house and generate electricity and then load your electric car with it
[01:22:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> It ain't the Wicked Car of the West, it won't melt
[01:22:10] <kuudes> that way you would effectively drive diesel but without taxes
[01:22:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Saves me from having to wash it, win-win
[01:22:18] <kuudes> Obormot\Arcturus, no, but I will
[01:22:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> You'll... melt?
[01:22:33] <nshepperd> gosh
[01:22:34] <kuudes> I don't want to be exposed to -30 C at winter
[01:22:53] <catern> while owning a car is still cringe, nevertheless, Obormot\Arcturus: what do you use your car for?
[01:22:53] <kuudes> nicer to drive into a cave and walk into a shop with just a shirt on

[01:23:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> lol
[01:23:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Again, most people park on the street here
[01:23:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's totally normal and doesn't harm modern cars at all
[01:23:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't know why anyone would think otherwise
[01:23:45] <kuudes> I would like cars to be moved more to underground
[01:23:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: Driving places
[01:24:06] <kuudes> surface could be for pedestrians when it is summer and nice weather, and for trees etc
[01:24:39] <kuudes> norway has it better, they have a lots of underground roads and parking, at least the last I was there
[01:24:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: I drive to stores to do shopping, to restaurants when I go out to eat sometimes, to a library, to parks, to the movies, to visit my friends, I drive my grandmother to doctor's appts... lots of stuff
[01:24:45] <kuudes> but they have more resources
[01:25:19] <kuudes> how are cabs in nyc?
[01:25:33] <catern> very contrarian, a normal new yorker would just walk, it's only a couple miles after all
[01:26:15] <galambo_> its more convenient for me to uber. there was a time when I briefly ubered to work. my driver would drop me off at the entrance. while the car drivers would have to make a 5-10 minute walk from the parking to the entrance.
[01:26:27] <galambo_> parking garage*
[01:26:40] <kuudes> I liked pre-uber taxi system here :-(
[01:27:07] <catern> galambo_: where are you located?
[01:27:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Outside of Manhattan? They're not
[01:27:17] <galambo_> catern, uk
[01:27:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: (We do have car services though)
[01:27:22] <catern> london?
[01:27:32] <galambo_> catern, used to. not anymore.
[01:28:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: Listen, don't give me that shit about walking. I used to walk home from class when I was in college. I'd walk right along the bus route that went from the front gate of the college to the front door of my house. 80+ blocks. I'd start walking and think "when a bus catches up to me I'll board it" and then it just wouldn't and I'd be at my house.
[01:28:30] <catern> well the ultimate no-car move is to live right next to your office, it's very convenient
[01:29:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hell, when I was little, and my family couldn't afford bus fare, we'd walk for miles just to get to a supermarket that was having a sale on chicken, and then walk miles back loaded down with groceries
[01:29:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Having a car is just better than any of that shit
[01:29:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> If I want to walk I'll get in my car, drive down to the waterfront, and walk there
[01:29:59] <catern> Obormot\Arcturus: I can tell you haven't fully acculturated to car culture because most of the country (aka car culture) would read "just walk, it's only a couple miles after all" as clear sarcasm
[01:31:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of course not, "car culture" is what they got out in those soul-crushing suburbs where you gotta walk through a mile of parking lots to get from one tiny island of habitability to the next
[01:32:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not for me!
[01:32:15] <adiabatic> ah, someone's finally talking about MY native habitat
[01:33:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Long, deep and expensive research trying to find a timeless cross-cultural warning sign for nuclear waste sites. Finally found: a skull with bones.
[01:33:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Showed it some kids, their faces light up: "Pirates!!""
[01:35:33] <kuudes> hmm, ok
[01:36:09] <Gurkenglas> mushroom cloud? hard to believe there won't be tales of nukes
[01:36:25] <Gurkenglas> or would that sound too much like a promise of power
[01:36:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: There's a small problem with using mushroom clouds to mean "nuclear waste"
[01:37:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Namely, that people would think it means... mushrooms
[01:37:48] <Gurkenglas> why not, even? put down some images of various poisonous animal species.
[01:38:04] <galambo_> is it a similar problem with getting stoned and stones?
[01:38:51] <saturn2> also mushroom clouds don't have anything to do with why it's a bad idea to be around a nuclear waste dump
[01:39:31] <Gurkenglas> i guess the part of nukes that's not about the earth-shattering kaboom might die out
[01:41:43] <kuudes> most of nuclear waste comes from powerplants, does it not?
[01:41:52] <galambo_> how about mushroom cloud and skulls and bones
[01:42:25] <rmmh> just like nobody would know what a mushroom cloud meant 200 years ago, it's not a good thing to indicate danger in 10,000 years
[01:42:34] <galambo_> and maybe like an upside down cockroach
[01:42:37] <saturn2> i think it's probably futile and a waste of time to try to warn people thousands of years in the future, i appreciate the memes though
[01:42:41] <galambo_> and a cracked casio f91w
[01:42:56] <catern> ray cats, we've got to do ray cats
[01:43:08] <rmmh> saturn2: it's really dumb, yes. all you have to do is bury the waste in the middle of a desert somewhere, backfill it, and seal off the entrance tunnels
[01:43:14] <Gurkenglas> display a population pyramid before and after opening the door :3
[01:43:28] <rmmh> any civilization advanced enough to dig up a few hundred feet of concrete will know about radiation
[01:43:37] <rmmh> or figure it out
[01:43:42] <galambo_> I propose we just install some very loud speakers and make them play crazy frog in a loop
[01:43:43] <kuudes> we could also nuke the waste?
[01:43:55] <rmmh> there are far more deadly things you can dig out of the ground than nuclear waste after 1000 years
[01:44:01] <galambo_> maybe do a hologram of a mushroom cloud?
[01:44:04] <kuudes> ie bury it underground, after burial launch an explosive which mixes the stuff into the ground
[01:45:02] <nshepperd> i think it is considered bad for nuclear waste to be mixed into the ground
[01:45:08] <catern> maybe we can put an installations with lots of fancy long-lasting guns above the nuclear waste, to indicate to future excavators that only death awaits them there
[01:45:22] <kuudes> well ground is already radioactive
[01:45:28] <catern> they'll take the guns and recognize that this is a terrible place that should not be excavated
[01:45:33] <kuudes> so you just need to mix it well enough and there is no difference
[01:45:52] <catern> ezpz
[01:46:02] <Gurkenglas> catern, hard to make the guns last that long; you wanna kills the intruders, put nuclear waste on top
[01:46:28] <kuudes> tomorrow I will get my third dose ^_^
[01:47:16] <nshepperd> Secure a subcritical core to the surface that kills anything that approaches within a km
[01:47:40] <galambo_> a solar powered sentry gun that shoots anything that approaches
[01:47:56] <Gurkenglas> with nuclear waste
[01:47:57] <saturn2> nuclear powered*
[01:48:11] <nshepperd> alternatively, construct a hilarious diorama made out of human skeletons
[01:48:11] <kuudes> tripwire the place with tactical nukes? so that if anyone approaches, a hole appears
[01:48:17] <galambo_> ancient egyptians had a similar problem with discouraging looters
[01:49:14] <catern> galambo_: genius! we'll just entomb evil undead mummies along with the radioactive waste, and they'll kill any intruders
[01:51:10] <galambo_> maybe like build a temple and then put on the walls all graphic stuff of people dying and suffering and being miserable
[01:51:36] <saturn2> genetically engineer a species of apes that's highly aggressive to humans and can only survive in the presence of high radioactivity

[01:58:26] <catern> you need to create some kind of perpetual nuclear fire
[01:59:33] <kuudes> two2thehead, I liked it
[01:59:35] <catern> which will serve as a deterrent, and then the heat from the perpetual explosion can be used to power other mechanisms to maintain it
[01:59:50] <two2thehead> good enough for me
[02:00:13] <galambo_> we can make it very smelly
[02:01:01] <two2thehead> kuudes, why not just do my preference, encase the radioactive material in concrete and dump it in the marianas trench?
[02:01:21] <nshepperd> The problem with this whole concept, except for the radioactive apes, is that when a human sees somewhere they clearly shouldn't go, they think "i wonder what's in there"
[02:01:23] <kuudes> it would be easier to just chew it to dust and spray it in the ocean
[02:01:24] <two2thehead> assuming the concrete is dense enough that just touching it won't have any effects at all
[02:01:27] <galambo_> two2thehead, but what if it leaks?
[02:01:34] <galambo_> how about we launch it into outer space

[02:02:06] <kuudes> iirc they start actually burying the waste there in... next year?
[02:02:16] <kuudes> ah, 2023
[02:02:36] <galambo_> we wont need to worry about this because nuclear is going out of fashion anyways
[02:02:52] <kuudes> sadly it had very low bus factor and the genius behind it accidentally got killed in a biking accident, which was bad
[02:03:08] <two2thehead> bus factor?
[02:03:13] <rmmh> nuclear is out of fashion but still the best base load option

[02:25:04] <rmmh> expert witness on "what is a yandere" 
[02:25:31] <kuudes> saturn2, there are things like what sort of capsules to make so that they won't leak in 100k year, what sort of splinters and aquifers to look in the ground to select chamber areas so that there is no water contact in 100k years etc
[02:26:06] <kuudes> how to transport the waste to and within the disposal site the most safe way
[02:26:14] <kuudes> enormous amount of details
[02:26:48] <saturn2> i see
[02:26:51] <kuudes> basicly a superfocus on the target "nothing comes out from there in next 100 000 years"
[02:27:29] <kuudes> "can we have a volcano in the area from tectonics within 100ky"
[02:28:25] <kuudes> how large water droplet stream force can accrue within 100ky, can it rust/cut copper platings etc
[02:28:55] <kuudes> basicly o get to level that anything anyone asks about the system has an answer
[02:29:48] <kuudes> something like "what if a meteor hits the spot and then people move in" and then the dude starts "well you see in the page 3651 in chart 2353..."
[02:32:52] <kuudes> finland apparently has some geological advantages that it will likely not have very big earthquakes in the target duration and indeed the talk is on the level "what if in 50ky a capsule leaks something into the local aquifer"
[02:33:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: I am generally inclined to have a lot of respect for that level of competence/preparedness, and I agree that this sort of project needs to have details considered (and isn't just "dig a big hole"), but just to play the devil's advocate... it seems to me that there is a certain level of detail in preparedness past which the value of that planning/preparation is swamped by the probability that you just made some mistake
[02:33:05] <Obormot\Arcturus>  in your model and/or there's unknown unknowns etc.
[02:33:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> ("Model uncertainty" etc.)
[02:33:33] <kuudes> indeed
[02:33:48] <kuudes> there is some amount of empiria behind the stuff though

[02:38:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Aren't we still not quite able to replicate Roman concrete
[02:38:42] <kuudes> and especially I like the idea that we seem to have sufficiently superfocused government officials who with salaries likely less than 6 numbers have caused some billions of losses for the nuke plant constructor when it has been not within specs

[22:11:53] <feepbot> <gwern> 'hen things started to fall apart. Later that year, Sergey Frolov, a physicist at the University of Pittsburgh, and his collaborator Vincent Mourik of the University of New South Wales in Australia were doing similar work in their own labs. (Both Frolov and Mourik are former members of Kouwenhoven’s group.) Frolov and Mourik found they couldn’t reproduce the Delft
[22:11:53] <feepbot> results. That October the duo asked Kouwenhoven’s group for their raw data, and in December they found some odd inconsistencies: It looked as though some of the plots had been manipulated, and the paper’s claims weren’t borne out when the full range of measurements was taken into account. Faced with these problems, Kouwenhoven’s group replotted their data and found the
[22:11:54] <feepbot> conclusions no longer stood up. In March 2021, at Kouwenhoven’s request, Nature retracted the paper. The group wrote in their retraction that they could “no longer claim the observation of a quantized Majorana conductance.” They added an apology “for insufficient scientific rigour in our original manuscript.” The incident triggered an investigation by an independent
[22:11:59] <feepbot> committee. The investigation concluded that there was no evidence of fraudulent data fabrication or manipulation. The authors had simply fooled themselves by zooming in only on the results that showed them what they hoped to see. “The research program the authors set out on is particularly vulnerable to self-deception, and the authors did not guard against this,” the authors of

[22:32:55] <Robomot> Book Review: The Scout Mindset: ... (Book Review: The Scout Mindset: ...)
[22:33:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> "But Galef earned her celebrity status honestly, through long years of hard labor in the rationality mines. Back in ~2007, a bunch of people interested in biases and decision-making joined the “rationalist community” centered around the group blogs Overcoming Bias and Less Wrong. Around 2012, they mostly left to do different stuff. Some of them went into AI to try to save the world. Others went into effective altruism to
[22:33:15] <Obormot\Arcturus>  try to revolutionize charity. Some, like me, got distracted and wrote a few thousand blog posts on whatever shiny things happened to catch their eyes. But a few stuck around and tried to complete the original project. They founded a group called the Center For Applied Rationality (aka “CFAR”, yes, it’s a pun) to try to figure out how to actually make people more rational in the real world."
[22:33:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> First of all: goddamnit, I never noticed that stupid pun
[22:33:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Second of all: CFAR gets you celebrity status?! "rationality mines"???
[22:33:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> They went mining for rationality and they didn't find shit!
[22:34:08] <gwern> also her podcast and blog
[22:35:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Her podcast and blog and just her regurgitating the Sequences and other rationality material, in a more boring, less incisive, and more normie way
[22:37:03] <Betawolf> surely 'rationality for normies' is a good effort at raising the sanity waterline?
[22:37:05] <ggreer> yeah how dare she spread good ideas and raise the sanity waterline
[22:38:11] <feep> well, scoutwise it's a good effort iff rationality training improves rationality
[22:38:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't have a problem with that but (a) she does it in a super boring way, (b) her *own* claims to rationality are directly undermined by said podcast/ec., (c) it sure doesn't get her "rationality celebrity status"
[22:38:39] <PapuaHardyNet> does anyone here actually use CFAR techniques
[22:38:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> no
[22:38:52] <PapuaHardyNet> lol
[22:39:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: How are we gonna use CFAR techniques when every time you ask CFAR what their fucking techniques even are they're like "attend one of our $3000 workshops, we refuse to just publish this stuff, that would be bad"?
[22:39:44] <ggreer> a couple of their techniques have spread. eg: finding the crux of each side's argument. also asking what would change your mind
[22:40:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ah yes, "double crux". Well, just peruse my posting history on LW to see some arguments about that one
[22:40:51] <ggreer> oh and the murphy's law technique: assume our plan fails. what is the most likely reason for us failing? ok, find a way to avert that. now what's the most likely reason for us failing? etc
[22:40:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> By the way, let me tell you, asking "what would change your mind" is a technique that people find *incredibly* annoying
[22:41:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> By all means feel free to try it on people you're arguing with, if you want them to hate you
[22:41:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> ggreer: That's just premortems, though. CFAR didn't invent premortems
[22:41:51] <ggreer> yeah yeah everything's a remix
[22:42:06] <ggreer> you don't start with a question like "what would change your mind?" you start by saying what would change your own mind
[22:42:28] <ggreer> then the other person looks kinda dumb if they can't state what would change their mind

[22:55:58] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: CFAR did finally release their handbook
[22:57:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Oh did they? Link?
[22:57:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> "One of the genuinely new ideas in _Scout Mindset_ is its endorsement of various counterfactual “tests”. The idea is, imagine yourself considering a similar question, under circumstances that would bias you the opposite direction. If you stick with your opinion, it’s probably honest; if you’d change your opinion in the counterfactual, you probably had it because of bias." ... hm
[22:59:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Or: sometimes pundits will, for example, make fun of excessively woke people by saying something like “in a world with millions of people in poverty and thousands of heavily-armed nuclear missiles, you’re really choosing to focus on whether someone said something slightly silly about gender?” Then they do that again. Then they do that again. Then you realize these pundits’ entire brand is making fun of people who say
[22:59:35] <Obormot\Arcturus>  silly things (in a woke direction) about gender, even though there are millions of people in poverty and thousands of nuclear missiles. So they ought to at least be able to appreciate how strong the temptation can be. As Horace puts it, “why do you laugh? Change the name, and the joke’s on you!”" ... wait, how is this an example of a counterfactual test
[23:00:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Status Quo Test: If you’re defending the status quo, imagine that the opposite was the status quo. Would you be tempted to switch to what you have now? For example, I sometimes feel tempted to defend American measurements - the inch, the mile, Fahrenheit, etc. But if America was already metric, and somebody proposed we should go to inches and miles, everyone would think they were crazy. So my attraction to US measurements
[23:00:02] <Obormot\Arcturus>  is probably just because I’m used to them, not because they’re actually better." ... what? THat doesn't follow at all!
[23:01:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> "(sometimes this is be fine: I don’t like having a boring WASPy name like “Scott”, but I don’t bother changing it. If I had a cool ethnically-appropriate name like “Menachem”, would I change it to “Scott”? No. But “the transaction costs for changing are too high so I’m not going to do it” is a totally reasonable justification for status quo bias)" ... lol. Sorry, Scott, we can't all be named after

[23:22:54] <Robomot> Half of unvaccinated workers say they'd rather quit than get a shot – but real-world data suggest few are following through (While surveys have shown a large share of unvaccinated workers threatening to quit over a mandate, the reality is few actually do.)
[23:23:07] <two2thehead> Excellent point "But while it is easy and cost-free to tell a pollster you’ll quit your job, actually doing so when it means losing a paycheck you and your family may depend upon is another matter."
[23:23:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Although I think that the emphasis on betting is actually a red herring among rationalists and does not mean or do what most rationalists think it does)
[23:24:39] <gwern> plus quitting and finding another job is actually quite a lot of work
