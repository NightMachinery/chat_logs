[03:03:35] <rxndxs> so for example, I have a call to 'printf' in my code, this gets compiled and linked to libc, then if I look at the binary, it actually calls a different symbol to exit, which looks like it simply jumps to the address given by a variable at some other symbol 'reloc.exit'
[03:04:05] <rxndxs> so I have a relocation symbol, and a function, so I imagine the loader populates the relovation ?
[03:05:53] <rxndxs> hmm actually I don't think so, because it holds a different value at load and when it reaches main, so I guess it is actually some C initialization that handles that

[05:53:48] <rxndxs> one time I was wondering why my client wasn't working at all, turns out I had the wrong IP address to the server ...
[05:54:17] <Caffeinated> Joanna: from my logs you rarely do talk about programming here.  lol
[05:55:06] <[itchyjunk]> i dont know where i got held up, i tried 2 different ways
[05:55:16] <[itchyjunk]> i used the eclipses install new software thing
[05:55:32] <[itchyjunk]> if installed javafx but now it complains that i need java 8 to run it
[05:55:37] <[itchyjunk]> idk how to uninstall that one either
[05:55:52] <[itchyjunk]> second way i tried was to download thing jars or w/e from the side directly
[05:56:04] <[itchyjunk]> i am somehow supposed to add them to some module path but that i couldn't figure out
[05:56:13] <[itchyjunk]> i did something but it then doesn't show up
[05:56:18] <Caffeinated> lol
[05:57:03] <Izem> yeah that's not much for me to go buy, if you want to experiment with javafx it seems to be easier to get via intellij
[05:57:08] <Izem> s/buy/by/
[05:59:32] <[itchyjunk]> intellij is different ide right?
[05:59:38] <[itchyjunk]> hmm, the course ide is eclipse
[05:59:48] <[itchyjunk]> i'll maybe ask what gui library they plan to use
[05:59:56] <[itchyjunk]> maybe it's thing swing thing you mentioned
[06:00:20] <Izem> most likely is

[10:50:11] *** bayaz sets mode: +q $a:AlexDeLarge
[10:50:46] <cis> CoderGuy: So... you could write a wrapper around the library your main class is based on, which the rest of your code can depend on. Then you can swap out the library as long as the main class's contract doesn't change...
[10:51:01] <arahael> CoderGuy: Ok, so for C#, you'll probably want to lean more towards using an interface for that top-level class, and using a factory to provide the implementation.

[10:52:44] <CoderGuy> yeah so how to choose it in such a way that it's easily changeable based on namespace or a config file
[10:52:44] <arahael> CoderGuy: Usually with C# projects, you don't replace files, though you could choose to use a code-generation approach where the "correct file" is copied into the relevant spot during the build, but this is not common.

[10:55:23] <cis> config is not unusual in dependency injection
[10:56:31] <arahael> Yeah, quite common - either programmatically in the program's entry point, or using a file.  There are a lot of inversion of control frameworks for C# but I'm not really a fan of them (having been burnt in the past by projects that did IoC too overzealously)
[10:57:14] <CoderGuy> well what's the simple way to do this though, such that Class A is somehow pointing to a specific file for Class A?

[13:45:41] <CuriousErnestBro> Using Argon2 is a bad development. experience, I should have never listened to you guys.
[13:45:45] <CuriousErnestBro> :(
[13:45:46] <Akronymus> One day...

[13:46:48] <CuriousErnestBro> That's not the problem.
[13:46:59] <DnzAtWrk> keep dat ass
[13:47:10] <CuriousErnestBro> The problem is how to manually upload an account to postgres.
[13:47:14] <CuriousErnestBro> And by account I mean username and password.
[13:47:28] <DnzAtWrk> do it in a script
[13:47:33] <DnzAtWrk> .psql
[13:47:43] <DnzAtWrk> or just do it manually in the psql prompt
[13:47:53] <DnzAtWrk> or edit the postgresql config file
[13:48:04] <password2> we use KeePass at work aswell
[13:48:27] <password2> before i implemented it you went to a random file and pulled out a half updated sheet
[13:48:31] <password2> now its a  vital tool
[13:48:56] <CuriousErnestBro> DnzAtWrk The question is how to generate argon2 password strings.
[13:49:12] <CuriousErnestBro> With python? Or is there a website where I can upload my argon2 secret and password.
[13:49:25] <DnzAtWrk> I wouldn't trust websites to generate my passwords
[13:49:35] <CuriousErnestBro> Yeah so what do I do?
[13:49:40] <DnzAtWrk> python sounds good
[13:50:01] <vdamewood> I use dd and base64 to generate my passwords.
[13:50:23] <CuriousErnestBro> I'm asking what I should use to argon2-ify it.
[13:50:37] <CuriousErnestBro> I use 1Password.
[13:50:40] <vdamewood> Ohh... I won't be helpful then.

[14:41:59] <GeDaMo> pyzozord: what was the staement optimized out?
[14:42:12] <vdamewood> pyzozord: face->num_charmaps is a single value. That value is stored (probably in a register), and the struct itself is gone.

[16:58:31] <pyzozord> oldlaptop: but everyone knows you are an old laptop :D
[16:58:32] <piou> Akronymus: I disagree on that specific point though
[16:58:39] <[itchyjunk]> .java is the source code, .jar is where the zipped up jvm machine code exists
[16:58:52] * mrig barks ...
[16:58:59] <[itchyjunk]> what about .class, that is all the classes needed from import file; ?
[16:59:02] * mrig wags tail, dang I gave it away!
[16:59:29] <[itchyjunk]> oh .java is the bytecode..
[16:59:38] <Akronymus> piou so, you think good contributions can be tainted just because of who made it?
[16:59:39] <[itchyjunk]> i guess .java is squeezed into jre?
[17:00:08] <piou> Akronymus: take a PR implicating a security aspect of the project for example. You know it's a difficult topic that often involves special expertise. Knowing that the programmer has prior experience with the topic, or possibly security experience specifically, has value. And that makes it worth looking who's the programmer proposing the PR. But IÂ don't care for political stuff.
[17:00:26] <Akronymus> Oh that's a good point.
[17:00:36] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: .java files are source code files written by humans, then using javac they're compiled to .class files which contain bytecode, then they're archived in .jar files which contains .class files and various other assets
[17:00:38] <Akronymus> You defined it as looking into technical ability
[17:00:48] <Akronymus> I was thinking more along the lines of unrelated to the project.
[17:01:05] <Akronymus> .jar is essentially a .zip
[17:01:10] <piou> I mean, if it's unrelated then by definition it's unrelated and probably shouldn't

[17:01:24] <[itchyjunk]> oh so like python and shit being an interpreted language
[17:01:30] <[itchyjunk]> so java is an interpreted language!?!?
[17:01:31] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: bytecode needs to be somehow processed to be executed, yes
[17:01:39] <Akronymus> May I talk to you in private for a sec? piou
[17:01:43] <piou> sure
[17:01:43] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: it's not strictly interpreted
[17:01:48] <[itchyjunk]> hmmmm
[17:01:55] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: but it does need to be processed, which may include interpretation
[17:02:14] <[itchyjunk]> .class is byte code and not machine code right?
[17:02:26] <piou> yes
[17:02:27] <[itchyjunk]> doesn't producing byte code imply interpreter then?
[17:02:44] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: "interpreted" and "compiled" are not a property of a language, but of a specific implementation of a programming languages
[17:02:56] <[itchyjunk]> oh
[17:02:58] <oldlaptop> [itchyjunk]: Java bytecode is machine code for a virtual machine.
[17:03:28] <[itchyjunk]> is python bytecode a machine code for some virtual machine too?
[17:03:36] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: although colloquially people may refer to some languages as "compiled" or "interpreted" because either they lend itself much better to one of these two execution models, or the most prominent implementation of a language is either one of these
[17:03:37] <oldlaptop> Yes.
[17:03:55] <[itchyjunk]> so all interpreters for interpreted languages are actually virtual machines!?!?
[17:04:21] <pyzozord> yes
[17:04:22] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: java produces bytecode which is then partially interpreted and partially JIT-compiled further to machine code
[17:04:46] <oldlaptop> Not quite in this sense, although you could certainly make that argument. It's a separate matter from the specific concept of bytecode VMs, as used by java or by python
[17:04:46] <mathAndRhetorics> what's the difference between data mining and analytics?
[17:04:47] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: python (at least its most popular implementation called cpython) produces bytecode which is then interpreted
[17:04:49] <[itchyjunk]> holy shit.. biggest secret in programming.. interpreters are actually hypothetical computers..
[17:05:17] <[itchyjunk]> oh it gets compiled again too in java?
[17:05:20] <pyzozord> [itchyjunk]: they are different resolution renditions of computers. It's not like you can install windows on all of them
[17:05:22] <[itchyjunk]> java seems stranger than other languages
[17:05:42] <[itchyjunk]> mathAndRhetorics, you can do analytics on mined data
[17:05:58] <pyzozord> pyzozord: as little as array and a for loop can make a virtual machine
[17:06:04] <pyzozord> lol
[17:06:06] <oldlaptop> Common JVM implementations use JIT compilation, so in one sense it does get "compiled again".
[17:06:12] <pyzozord> [itchyjunk]: that was for you
[17:06:35] <[itchyjunk]> hmmm
[17:07:26] <[itchyjunk]> interesting that it depends on the implimentation of a language and not language itself.. the language ends up just being the syntax then?
[17:07:27] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: interpreting bytecode is a popular execution model, but there're other models we also typically call interpreters
[17:07:36] <pyzozord> [itchyjunk]: that goes into computation theory. Look up what is Finate State Automaton and Turing Machine
[17:07:53] <[itchyjunk]> i can't say a language is x or y because it depends on what you do to the syntax to make things go at the end of it
[17:08:03] <[itchyjunk]> deniska, oh..
[17:08:45] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: there're AST walkers for example, which are sometimes used, ruby was implemented as one for a while
[17:08:46] <[itchyjunk]> ah yes i wanted to learn about finite state machines and stuff
[17:08:52] <[itchyjunk]> last time i looked at it, i was confused
[17:09:02] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: which also falls under "interpreters" category
[17:09:10] <mathAndRhetorics> [itchyjunk] you can do anything on mined data, as well as on non-mined. You can mine mined data, analyze mined data, or analyze analyzed data. So, this doesn't help me to understand.
[17:09:34] <mathAndRhetorics> [itchyjunk] you can also analyze mined data and mine analyzed data
[17:09:56] <[itchyjunk]> hmm i can't find the def for AST Walkers
[17:09:58] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: and then in older days we also had what you may call "actual interpreters", looking at the code line by line, performing actions, moving between lines etc. Some old interpreters of unstructured BASIC worked that way

[17:12:28] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: it's hard to go directly from a long string of characters to a list of opcodes, so compilers have a fairly typical structure, at least at high level
[17:13:15] <[itchyjunk]> maybe it tries to find all special tasks first?
[17:13:19] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: first they do what's called "lexing", translating a stream of letters to a stream of "words" which a language works with
[17:13:20] <[itchyjunk]> like if else, for loops etc

[17:14:47] <[itchyjunk]> i see!
[17:15:10] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: then another part of a compiler comes, called a parser, which translates this list of words to a tree

[17:17:42] <Akronymus> ebnf is pretty useful.
[17:17:46] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: and this AST is something you may actually write an executor for, like recursively traverse (walk) this tree, hence the term "AST walker"

[17:58:53] <mrig> null could do it too :P
[17:59:09] <sjmulder> [itchyjunk], heap does not stay after program exit
[17:59:11] * mrig points at the void.
[17:59:48] <[itchyjunk]> oh i must have misread
[18:00:05] <sjmulder> when a function is called, it stores its variables (and return address) on the top of the stack, when a function returns those are removed again
[18:00:08] * pyzozord sends mring a sigv
[18:00:26] * mrig typecasts the void pointer into something tangible.
[18:00:40] <piou> sjmulder: they're not though, removed
[18:00:44] <sjmulder> so the lifecycle of values on the stack is bound to that of the function. the heap is separate, there you have to allocate and free explicitly (or have a language runtime do it for you)
[18:00:45] <wedr> Ah, I got it wrong. The OS manages the heap for your program. The OS still thinks you need that memory and doesnât clear it until the program ends.
[18:01:08] <[itchyjunk]> when i call a function, it stores it's local variables and returns the addresses of where those local variables are to the compiler/interpreter? (for garbage collection) ?
[18:01:08] <Akronymus> wedr or you free it
[18:01:09] <sjmulder> piou, conceptually.. but didn't want to go into too much detail
[18:01:35] <piou> sjmulder: but details matter if you're talking about whether they remain in memory after the program is killed
[18:01:40] * mrig ponders the the big bootstrapping, thinks there could be material for a comic book in there somewhere.
[18:01:45] <piou> Because they very much do
[18:01:45] <Akronymus> Stack simply doesn't care about allocations.
[18:02:04] <Akronymus> It only cares about the stackpointer, basepointer and any offsets.
[18:02:05] <[itchyjunk]> oh but if a function is assigning temp variables, should the OS release that after the function is done?
[18:02:05] <sjmulder> [itchyjunk], your local variables are already there. then when you call another function, the current location in your current function are stored (so it knows where to return to later), and then the new functions stores its variables on top of the stack
[18:02:07] <[itchyjunk]> it keeps it?
[18:02:18] <pyzozord> I really think that unlimited stack and no heap could lead to better software architecture

[18:06:53] <[itchyjunk]> right?

[22:21:34] <alycidyne> mawk: essentially, such a machine would have to have a strictly chronological layout of data; e.g. system vars are at the bottom, runtime in the middle, caller just before the arguments
[22:21:53] <mawk> presumably yes alycidyne 
[22:22:10] <mawk> although caller etc are notions that are not mandatory
