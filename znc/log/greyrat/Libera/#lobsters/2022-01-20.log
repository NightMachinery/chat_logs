[04:02:04] <rtpg> Ah.... I had applied to Doist cuz they had a job position that finally aligned with what I thought was my skillset (senior Python dev) but I couldn't even get past the screening. Recently been really regretting that I've stayed at my current company for so long
[04:02:39] <rtpg> It's a nice work environment but the problemspace is very "simple" (CRUD-y fintech stuff) so I don't have much in the ways of difficult problems to build up experience for larger companies I feel like
[04:03:46] <rtpg> And personally I don't know how I like... work on problems prone to things like race conditions in my freetime in a way that's convincing to screeners
[04:05:01] <indigo> rtpg: Isn't it all just leetcode/algorithm problems for the interview?
[04:05:56] <indigo> Also don't get so down on yourself; I'm sure you solve hard problems at your current place
[04:06:11] <indigo> And there is no reason to believe the problems will be harder at a larger company :)
[04:06:20] <rtpg> The application here was "please send in your resume", then they asked a followup for details about "hard problems" I've worked on, and I tried to go in detail on what I could come up with but a lot of it is of the "we didn't have this standard thing, so I built it"...

[09:32:38] <daegalus> What are people's thoughts on a trend of pda/blackberry like devices I've been seeing a lot lately. First the Precursor, then now I see this rpi 2w based device with a keyboard. A blackberry keyboard/screen like featherwing on adafruit
[09:33:16] <daegalus> I'm all for it but curious on why all of a sudden. Nostalgia? I do know it reminds me of the Cybiko and Peek devices
[09:33:34] <daegalus> I even ordered the featherwing to try and make a LoRA messenger
[09:34:12] <rtpg> daegalus: as a person who is curious about those devices, my biggest issue is that the keyboards don't look very usable? I think there was a window where blackberry PDAs had decent keyboards compared to futzy touch keyboards, but I have my doubts about any non-mass-produced device offering something nice like that

[09:34:49] <daegalus> Well the featherwing from adafruit uses the actual blackberry keyboard parts
[09:35:53] <rtpg> there is something nostalgic about things like a palm PDA. For me there's this idea of getting to computing devices which aren't "simply" "devices to get into the web" and more like, well, PDAs. Purpose built devices that just store your data on the machine and can work at a human pace, rather than being Yet Another Pipeline For Data
[09:37:14] <daegalus> I'm with you. I guess with all the privacy/cloud/ads/data talk nowadays older designs are more interesting to people
[09:38:17] <daegalus> I also like that most of the ideas have LoRA for communication
[09:38:37] <rtpg> I'm also a bit "nostalgic" for the idea of going back to inbox/outbox models. You pick up your data when you can, you can prep your answers, and they go out when they go out. But at the same time.... well... I mean my phone has the quality of working
[09:40:26] <technomancy> I'm nostalgic for using a Palm V to connect to my pop3 server over IrDA in the Singapore airport before wifi was invented.
[09:40:37] <technomancy> that was goddamn incredible

[09:45:45] <daegalus> I remember having a Motorola mpx220, flip phone that ran Windows Mobile 5 I think or 6. I was using Apps and shit on my phone before iphones.
[09:46:02] <daegalus> Some things just felt easier back then, in a more complicated obscure way
[09:46:47] <rtpg> Having things like dedicated buttons to say "jump to contacts/emails/whatever" meant that for those specific uses you really could just get up and running real quick
[09:48:16] <daegalus> I kind of would like a dedicated asynchronous communication device without clouds, extra apps, etc. Just nostalgia talking but I think I'm just overwhelmed with all the bullshit these days
[09:48:59] <daegalus> Maybe I need to find a cheap Android device, and install just messaging apps on it, gut everything else. And use that for async chats
[09:49:25] <rtpg> federated AIM or something... the "cheap android device" thing is tempting until I remember how awful some cheap android devices are
[09:49:26] <poqomchi> My dad bought every PDA made. He had a Newton with a PCMCIA card that had a pop-out phone jack
[09:49:53] <technomancy> I'm still mad they killed IrDA and replaced it with a shitty protocol that never actually works
[09:49:54] <rtpg> mine had one for work, I remember reading the "100 tropes of JRPGs" on some website through WAP on there
[09:50:00] <daegalus> Though I think my problem is the fact we have 2847829284838282 messaging apps and protocols and most are proprietary. I hate how many I have to keep track of
[09:50:00] <poqomchi> OK, every PDA made is an exaggeration. He went through the Newton and three or four different Palm Pilots lol
[09:50:37] <daegalus> My dad was tech savvy so we had palm pilots, ipaqs, Motorola MPX phones, desktops, laptops, etc.
[09:50:50] <autonomousvehicl> What about the Wizard?
[09:52:17] <daegalus> rtpg: fair point but cheap I mean an old flagship. And if you install something light on it like lineage or build an even more stripped down aosp build. If you have just 10 messaging apps on it and a browser, it should be fine. Install microG or minimal play store
[09:53:32] <daegalus> I'm also considering making a browser that has everything JS stripped out of it and use that only. Or a Gemini/Gopher/Hyperspace/yggsrassil thing. I hear the Ariane app works well for that
[09:54:48] <technomancy> daegalus: please please make a frontend for netsurf that has actual key bindings
[09:54:56] <daegalus> I'm fine web browsers becoming universal app platforms, but we need to split it out and offer a Document Web variation without the BS
[09:55:09] <daegalus> JS BS*
[09:55:12] <technomancy> if I didn't have a deep and abiding hatred of C I would be doing that right this moment
[09:55:37] <daegalus> I rather port it our of C, then make a frontend. I have a hatred for C and C++ also.

[12:14:41] <gerikson> I can type notes into SimpleNote faster and more legibly than I could to the same with a pen, digital or no
[12:15:14] <gerikson> anyway, both Kindle and Remarkable(?) are super-connected
[12:15:53] <gerikson> a lot of the PDA nostalgia is from them being non-connected
[12:16:02] <gerikson> which is frankly weird
[12:16:51] <rtpg> for me I think a lot of the aesthetics is that devices used to be like... doing stuff that wasn't just "do things on the web" I guess
[12:17:35] <rtpg> like the whole "devices are more focused on cosuming rather than creating" vibe. I had the internet on these devices before, but I also was doing other stuff on them that was more emotionally satisfying, I suppose

[12:18:16] <gerikson> rtpg: that dichotomy never made any sense to me
[12:18:29] <gerikson> people who say that also love books, which are consume-only
[12:18:50] <rtpg> Or like... were playing games or whatever, right? I'm also part of that
[12:18:52] <gerikson> it's that old moralism that some content is good, and some is bad
[12:19:27] <gerikson> some games have lore that generate a ton of discussion
[12:19:49] <gerikson> just because that's on reddit or Steam and not in some journal somewhere doesn't make it "consumption"
[12:19:54] <rtpg> I think for me, if I had to nail it down, it's that with books and games, I have this prepared experience that is well built for entertainment, but especially with social media and a lot of web content, it's a lot of kinda hastily prepared stuff that is trying to get at my addictive nature
[12:20:08] <gerikson> well ok I can get behind that
[12:20:13] <rtpg> (and some games do that as well! I would play a lot of games and then after a while realise I was basically grinding)
[12:20:22] <gerikson> yup
[12:20:39] <gerikson> sometimes you just wanna relax tho
[12:21:00] <rtpg> It's a bit of nostalgia but I remember being on newgrounds and playing these pretty silly games, and on the forums talking about those and taking that energy into Adobe Flash and trying to do stuff
[12:21:34] <rtpg> which is way nicer of an evening for me than... arguing about Rust v C for the umpteenth time cuz of some blog post (I definitely know better than do that now lol)
[12:21:47] <gerikson> haha
[12:22:00] <gerikson> not everyone is a creative type
[12:22:22] <gerikson> and not everyone has an unhealthy relationship with social media
[12:22:30] <rtpg> true, not trying to judge, it's a personal thing for me
[12:22:40] <gerikson> ok!
[12:22:50] <gerikson> sorry if I came off harshly
[12:23:20] <rtpg> and like "talking to your friends all the time" is a totally legit way to spend time! Just like.. there are times in my life where my interactions with technology felt a bit better and so I'm trying to diff it
[12:23:32] <gerikson> yup
[12:24:54] <rtpg> Places like lobsters (and some nice discords I'm in) make me optimistic, I believe it's possible to create nice spaces and orient things in a nice way, and kinda activate the "want to make stuff" part of the brain which ends up being the most satisfying
[12:25:10] <gerikson> yes, the key is finding them
[12:25:35] <rtpg> and I bet a lot of the "raspi in a box" stuff is also about that, where the people making it are also just really excited about making this thing that's reaching for these ideas, even if it's not a world-conquering thing
[12:25:58] <rtpg> hell, the raspi itself is that! A shitty computer in a tiny box, but it's an awesome thing and people do loads with it

[12:29:45] <enterprisey> it's a shame more people don't know what they're missing, or how to address the feeling that they're missing out on good community
[12:31:33] <vladimyr> Some of them spend large amounts of time, like years, before they find something that suits them

[12:41:14] <vladimyr> So true!

[12:50:11] <wink> I am halfway with you, I also miss them - but on the other hand I think they're closer to mailing lists than we had thought
[12:50:18] <wink> whereas discourse feels just like reddit
[12:51:35] <iDrougge> When web forums were all the rage, everyone was nostalgic for BBSes.
[12:51:53] <vladimyr> I'd also love to see some list of good old school forums that are still alive
[12:52:32] <iDrougge> That reminds me that web forums are also doing a great community service that FB never does.
[12:53:02] <vladimyr> Except phpbb worked and monstrosity called discourse can't properly keep scroll position due to lazy loading stuff using js
[12:53:08] <iDrougge> You can google a hifi receiver and end up on a fifteen year old forum thread about it, whereas everything on FB is flushed or walled off.
[12:53:36] <iDrougge> And with so many technical projects moving to Discord, so much valuable information is no longer googlable.
[12:53:38] <vladimyr> And that's such a good feelin
[12:54:13] <wink> vladimyr: yes. it was crude (even for 2006 web standards) but it simp,y worked
[12:55:15] <iDrougge> Well, phpBB never worked. It has always been awful. BBcode really hurts the hands. Quoting is so bad that everyone just quotes a wall of text to add a single line comment or skip quoting altogether leaving you no clue as to what they're replying to since even Usenet has a better notion of threads than phpBB.

[12:58:27] <iDrougge> Discourse doesn't really have that problem yet.
[12:58:53] <vladimyr> Which problem?
[12:58:57] <iDrougge> Quoting is usually a crutch, hence you need it on phpBB.
[12:59:01] <maskd> wink: funny you say that, I was trying to come up with a reason why Discourse feels different to me and I thought it feels too much like a mailing list. probably just because of the particular Discourses I've seen
[12:59:38] <iDrougge> vladimyr: The quoting problem. It is obvious which message you are replying to so you seldom need to quote the original since it can be expanded in-line.
[13:00:19] <iDrougge> maskd: I think a lot of them have replaced mailing lists and even started out by importing the mailing list digests.
[13:00:27] <wink> maskd: let me elaborate, I'd see a "category/subforum" as one ML - so a typical web forum would be like 3-5 MLs, but not "all topics on the front page"
[13:01:38] <vladimyr> iDrougge: i actually prefer it other way around, flat threads over tree of replies that quickly goes out of control

[13:11:26] <rtpg> I’ve found infinite nesting to be a bit of an anti feature… like break it into its own discussion or something. I guess it’s how you can have convos with 100s of people at once but sometimes I am like “just go to a new thread please”

[13:21:00] <enterprisey> pages are not the menace that discourse thought they were

[13:22:06] <vladimyr> That infinite scroll on discourse is horrible
[13:22:18] <iDrougge> Well, pages is just another web-induced wart. Apart from ease of posting pictures, the web has introduced so much regression in online communication.

[13:30:22] <gerikson> iDrougge: but that's my point, is the reason you had good comms the *software* or the *people*
[13:30:31] <riv> infinite scroll in mario is more like when you hits his head of the same block over and over again trying to get more coins
[13:30:40] <riv> except it's cute pictures on instagram instead

[13:35:23] <enterprisey> and I immediately thought about how most websites almost certainly don't do that
[13:35:29] <iDrougge> Web developers never use the keyboard apart from entering text.

[19:44:10] <pushcx> JordiGH: That's a decent high-level understanding. The primary benefit is that it can be cheaper than maintaining individual API endpoints, especially when you're at a scale where overselecting or underselecting are noticeable costs.
[19:44:58] <JordiGH> Oh, so like...
[19:45:19] <JordiGH> Here's a database. But we don't wanna make a bunch of JSON HTTP urls for it! Instead, have a single url and ask whatever you want.
[19:45:21] <JordiGH> Like that?
[19:45:58] <JordiGH> So, GraphQL is like SQL but JSON and therefore less Bobby.
[19:47:28] <banna> I haven't used graphql before, but I imagine it like a query language that associates specific string keys with typed datastructures
[19:48:08] <pushcx> JordiGH: Yep. It's also (deliberately) significantly less featureful than SQL, notably no native support for predicates, so you'll see conventions like `filter: { age_gt: 18 }` instead of `WHERE age > 18`

[20:39:04] <pushcx> I've been working exclusively in JS for a year or so. I am so mad at nonsense like modules, import vs require, etc. So weird that such basic stuff is so broken and can't interop.
[20:39:44] <feoh> pushcx: Totally agree. It speaks to a lack of a cohesive community which is very unfortunate given that JS has such wide adoption
[20:40:14] <feoh> Everybody hates on Ruby and Python and you can rant and roar at their respective packaging stories but they have infra that, like, works :) Including very fine REPLs in both cases.
[20:40:28] <chenghiz_> es modules were a bad idea basically
[20:41:18] <chenghiz_> if you keep to commonjs, node works fine and is consistent
[20:41:39] <chenghiz_> not sure what you mean by 'web console' feoh
[20:42:02] <iDrougge> "Consistent" isn't exactly the first word that comes to mind thinking of Javascript.

[20:43:50] <chenghiz_> there is also a command line debugger, i haven't used it though
[20:44:15] <feoh> So to be clear since I've had more than a few JS developers kinda look up and sasy "BUH? WHUH? What are you asking?"
[20:44:25] <feoh> I'm used to programming languages like Python or Ruby or hell even Perl
[20:44:28] <feoh> where you get a REPL
[20:44:49] <feoh> a nice, feature complete command line programming environment where I can try things out, type expressions, import packages and play with them and my data
[20:45:01] <feoh> And I asked on various social media if there was a similar thing in nodejs
[20:45:14] <feoh> The answer was "No either use WebStorm or the browser's developer console"
[20:45:19] <feoh> And that does not spark joy :)
[20:45:33] <chenghiz_> huh well there is definitely a repl that has all those things
[20:45:45] <feoh> Please see my link about
[20:45:48] <feoh> node comes with a REPL
[20:45:51] <feoh> but I can't import things
[20:45:59] <banna> We can't forget about typescript now can we?
[20:46:12] <feoh> Therefore I can't actually evaluate expressions in the context of the packages and data I'm using in my programs
[20:46:23] <chenghiz_> the problem you're running into is that there are two ways of importing modules - es module, and commonjs
[20:46:53] <feoh> banna: Heh I like TS but I'm not there yet. I feel like you have to kind of ignore it and learn how to crawl in JS then learn to fly :)
[20:46:58] <chenghiz_> commonjs is the original standard but because of es modules the word "import" is overloaded in nodejs land because es module use the "import" word
[20:47:02] <feoh> chenghiz_: I believe you :)
[20:47:24] <chenghiz_> commonjs uses "require" e.g. `const fs =- require('fs')`
[20:47:24] <banna> feoh: very true. TypeScript extends the shortfalls of javascript, though - and adds to them IMO
[20:47:39] <chenghiz_> require is usable in the repl out of the box
[20:47:54] <feoh> Good to know, thanks
[20:48:10] <chenghiz_> (also, ignore the `-` above)
[20:48:26] <technomancy> feoh: that's odd because when I used to do ruby in the repl and I'd show everyone how I worked they were always flabbergasted

[20:50:43] <feoh> technomancy: I also like how a really good IDE can help here too. Like, in the Pycharm IDE and I'm told Webstorm too but haven't tried, you get editor/REPL integration like you do in SLIME and that's another level up IMO.

[21:07:41] <companion_cube> it's just an extension of the smug lisp user, really
[21:08:14] <feoh> It's only tiring when you generally code in languages that don't lend themselves well to using a REPL IMO

[21:14:18] <feoh> companion_cube: I'm not actually arguing with you, just to be clear, but let me give you an illustrative example and see how that hits you :) - My mentee comes to me recently and says "I have to use this client that interacts with a rather complicated API, and I can't make it go."
[21:15:09] <vladimyr> feoh: take a look at this https://github.com/alidavut/locus
[21:15:10] <mockturtle> [ GitHub - alidavut/locus: Locus is a debugging module for node.js ] - github.com

[21:15:35] <companion_cube> iDrougge: too bad it's 0.00% interesting to me :p
[21:16:16] <feoh> companion_cube: So I suggest that he fire up a REPL and interactively inspect the seething giant blob of an object he gets back, examining the data types of the various bits and bobs so he knows ah that's an array, THAT is a dictionary oh THAT is a boolean! and it's like the light bulb went off. He could now successfully interact with the thing.
[21:16:16] <feoh> Could he do this with an editor and endless print statements? Sure! But it's orders of magnitude faster in this context to use a REPL.

[21:26:46] <companion_cube> were you using google's implementation? :D
[21:26:48] <iDrougge> The other side of the janus face are those interfaces where some things absolutely can't be optional, so you receive nonsense values instead.
[21:26:56] <indigo> Yeah man!
[21:27:26] <feoh> My impression of protobuf is it's fantastic if you're GOOG and moving vast unimaginable quantities of data with your RPC but there are many many use cases where that level of bit twiddling and concordant risk of corruption makes zero sense.
