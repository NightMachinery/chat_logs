[19:15:30] <onizu> Is 'Directory' name safe to be used as a class name?
[19:15:52] <AllenJB> If you namespace it: Definitely
[19:17:08] <AllenJB> PHP core has a Directory class already, so you would have to namespace it: https://www.php.net/Directory
[19:25:35] *** Joins: no_gravity (~no_gravit@user/no-gravity/x-5639427)
[19:25:48] <Blondie101010> this is why namespaces were created...  you start off with a unique base namespace and get 0 conflicts
[19:26:10] <no_gravity> Is it guaranteed that "$a = array_values(array_unique($a))" will leave the elements of $a in order and only remove entries?
[19:26:55] <onizu> ok, thanks !
[19:28:37] <__adrian> no_gravity: yes
[19:28:45] <no_gravity> __adrian: Awesome, thanks!
[19:29:01] <__adrian> though make sure you have the right expectations about array_unique as well  :)
[19:29:10] <no_gravity> __adrian: How do you mean?
[19:31:19] <onizu> array_unique() checks values, not keys
[19:31:40] <onizu> well obviously >.<
[19:32:14] <onizu> sorry
[19:33:19] <AllenJB> As I read the docs, array_unique sorts values (see the flags), so output order is not guaranteed to be the same as input order, particularly for no-assoc entries: https://www.php.net/array_unique
[19:33:34] <AllenJB> *non-assoc.
[19:34:11] <no_gravity> AllenJB: What? Let me read ...
[19:35:13] <no_gravity> AllenJB: I don't see that it says it is sorting values.
[19:36:13] <no_gravity> It has some flags called "SORT_..." but that seems to rather mean "compare" than "sort".
[19:36:47] <no_gravity> I would think that dabbles only with the question which items are considered to be equal.
[19:37:50] <__adrian> if you have duplicate values in the array, which one is kept? if you don't at least realize which one is kept, this might cause the order to be unexpected
[19:38:29] <no_gravity> __adrian: In my use case it would not matter which one is kept. What is important is that no element moves around to a place where it has not been before.
[19:38:37] <__adrian> also: array_unique doesn't sort, despite the names of the flags. it reuses the SORT_* constants but only for comparisons
[19:39:08] <no_gravity> So 'a,b,a,c' -> 'a,b,c' would be fine and 'b,a,c' would be fine too. But 'c,a,b' would be a desaster.
[19:39:14] <__adrian> no_gravity: so what if you had  [1,0,1]  ?  you'd end up with only 1 and 0, but what order would they be in? and is that what you wanted?
[19:40:04] <no_gravity> __adrian: [1,0] and [0,1] would both be fine.
[19:40:08] <__adrian> "...would be a disaster"  so long as you know. but it's not clear to me what your expectations/requirements are, from that example.
[19:40:11] <__adrian> ok
[19:40:19] <__adrian> so long as you're aware
[19:40:28] <biberu> why would c,a,b be bad for you?
[19:41:42] <no_gravity> Long story. The data is part of a natural langauge processor that learns certain things from de-duplicated sequences of strings.
[19:41:52] <no_gravity> biberu: ^
[19:42:19] <no_gravity> biberu: One thing it deducts might be that sentences tend to end in 'c' but seem to rarely begin with 'c'.
[19:42:56] <onizu> __adrian: "if you have duplicate values in the array, which one is kept? if you don't at least realize which one is kept, this might cause the order to be unexpected " -- good point. Which one does it keep btw, the first ?
[19:43:09] <no_gravity> biberu: So if 'c' jumps from the end to the beginning that would confuse it.
[19:45:00] <biberu> no_gravity: sure, i don't get how that ties into your problem, but it's a curious issue
[19:45:33] <no_gravity> biberu: I have a problem?
[19:46:00] <biberu> i don't know, just found it interesting that that result would be disastrous
[19:46:35] <no_gravity> biberu: As I explained, it would lead to wrong conclusions about where 'c' tends to be in the order of words.
[19:47:30] <biberu> anyway, if it is, you may want to try to pin down the expected behavior of array_unique with some tests of your own, unless it's already guaranteed (not to change) by php
[19:47:50] <no_gravity> biberu: In all my tests the order was kept.
[19:48:59] <biberu> keep those :)

[22:12:26] <celphi> Ok so `catch(Exception ...)` i shouldnt use? Do you have a good documentation on the best way to use nowadays?
[22:12:42] <__adrian> "@__adrian> catch the exception you expect to be thrown"
[22:13:15] <__adrian> you catch when you expect a problem that you know how to solve. if you don't know what problem you expect, or don't know how to solve it, you don't catch.
[22:13:36] <__adrian> catching the base Exception class implies you don't know what you're catching. it could be anything.
[22:15:09] <celphi> __adrian: k, wouldnt i want that at the bottom sorta like `default:` works on a switch?
[22:15:24] <AllenJB> celphi: See also https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.errors.php7.php - thrown Errors are not Exceptions
[22:16:11] <celphi> k ty AllenJB.
[22:16:32] <celphi> And ty __adrian your 2nd statement makes sense.
[22:16:33] <__adrian> celphi: yes, it would. EXCEPT (a) TypeError doesn't extend from Exception  (b) that's specifically what you shouldn't be doing. let it go uncaught. this is what exception handlers are for.
[22:16:55] <celphi> gotcha cool very logical
