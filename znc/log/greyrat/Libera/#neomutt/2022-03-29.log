[15:36:14] <flatcap> hi gahr 
[15:37:03] <flatcap> have you got the hang of tag-transforms, now?
[15:37:23] <gahr> I think I have
[15:37:38] <flatcap> that makes one of us :-)
[15:37:43] <gahr> it totally escaped me that the two commands created mappings in opposite directions
[15:37:47] <gahr> haha
[15:37:58] <flatcap> yeah, I saw the comments.  weird
[15:38:53] <flatcap> surely, we're looking up a text tag to find its icon
[15:39:02] <gahr> yes
[15:39:17] <gahr> then we're looking up an expando (??) like GI to see what tags it matches
[15:39:44] <gahr> in a very inefficient way, if I might add
[15:39:52] <flatcap> hehe
[15:41:16] <gahr> no, the last comment was referred to TagTransforms, here: https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/blob/5b02349f70d682699907c40f10e2819e31e1b55f/menu/draw.c#L75-L84

[15:57:06] <flatcap> ok
[16:00:30] <gahr> I added a note how to test it
[16:00:44] <gahr> it's a half-baked feature: there's no way to remove or modify an existing transform/format
[16:00:55] <gahr> but I'm just fixing a memory leak here :)
[16:03:50] <flatcap> :-)
[16:34:38] <mfiano> Are there plans to adopt a versioning scheme that denotes the API (semver or such)?
[16:35:45] <gahr> where for API you mean the config and commands?
[16:36:29] <mfiano> Moreso the underlying C functions for manipulating things.
[16:36:34] <mfiano> I'm thinking of writing FFI bindings at some point.
[16:36:53] <gahr> why would you do that?
[16:37:52] <mfiano> Because live coding in Lisp is great.
[16:38:09] <gahr> sure
[16:38:29] *** CoWaxDanguin is now known as LibreHacker
[16:38:40] <gahr> we don't expose a neomutt library, though
[16:39:04] <gahr> what would you like to be able to do with a FFI? And against what?
[16:43:17] *** Joins: jindraj (~jindraj@neomutt/jindraj)
[16:44:13] <mfiano> Configure neomutt with Lisp instead of Lua, add some new functionality I would like, and be able to control Neomutt from the Lisp REPL I always have open and practically live in.
[16:44:41] <gahr> so it's more about an IPC than a FFI?
[16:45:14] <gahr> there was a discussion about exposing an IPC where you could run neomutt commands
[16:45:26] <mfiano> I don't think IPC would like me add a new message hook, and other things I'd like to write in Lisp.
[16:45:37] <mfiano> s/like/let/
[16:45:54] <gahr> yeah but a FFI means a library
[16:46:03] <gahr> you usually interface with a library through FFI
[16:46:07] <mfiano> Ok sure. That's why I asked.
[16:46:41] <gahr> ok but if you have a library, which parts of neomutt would it implement?
[16:46:52] <gahr> where would the UI run?
[16:47:52] <mfiano> I don't know anything about the codebase yet to answer that.
[16:47:54] <gahr> you'd like to be able to (let n (neomutt-make)... (neomutt-set-message-hook n ....) .. etc?
[16:48:08] <gahr> ok that's more scheme than CL, butyou get the point :)
[16:48:11] *** LibreHacker is now known as werdnA
[16:48:19] <gahr> then (neomutt-run n) ?
[16:49:07] <gahr> mfiano: let me ask a different question: do you have an example of a similar program (i.e., a UI-based executable) that exposes something like what you're interested in?
[16:49:08] <mfiano> Or just hook into the event loop itself.
[16:49:39] <gahr> ok to hook into the event loop itself you'd need an IPC.. you'd need to be able to talk with a live process
[16:49:47] <gahr> not just to call some logic in a library
[16:50:04] <mfiano> If there's no clear distinction between the UI level and the control level, then don't worry about it.
[16:50:31] <mfiano> Random trivia: Lisp invented FFI
[16:50:50] <gahr> this is rather language agnostic
[16:50:54] <gahr> as a discussion, I mean
[16:51:04] <mfiano> Indeed.
[16:51:05] <gahr> but I need to understand what you're thinking
[16:51:09] <gahr> give me an example
[16:52:10] <mfiano> An overly ambitious example would be to interface with everything that would let me write a non-curses interface with all the functionality.
[16:52:24] <mfiano> Not that I would do that
[16:52:54] <gahr> ok so no event loop
[16:52:58] <gahr> you'd code that yourself
[16:53:18] <gahr> and just use our email parsing routines, IMAP state machine, etc.. under the hood
[16:54:09] <mfiano> But the ability to define additional hooks on state changes would be mostly what I'd use it for.
[16:54:19] <mfiano> Instead of being confined to the static ones
[16:54:34] <gahr> that, I understand :)
[16:55:08] <gahr> so you'd be able to use $language in a neomuttrc
[16:55:30] <gahr> including importing modules, etc, so you only call functions defined somewhere else
[16:55:44] <mfiano> For example, I'd like to be able to route incoming mail to different local Maildir mailboxes, instead of filtering server-side.
[16:56:16] <gahr> oh so you want your live repl to trigger a condition on mail arrival
[16:56:20] <mfiano> mutt is inherently interactive, and no real way to do that. Not neomutt's fault
[16:56:32] <mfiano> Yes
[16:56:45] <gahr> ok, I see that more as a highly structured IPC
[16:57:03] <gahr> say we put in place an IPC in whatever structured format
[16:57:22] <gahr> xml, json, protobuf
[16:57:32] <gahr> and we send events and can receive actions back
[16:58:04] <mfiano> That might be a good start for sure.
[16:58:18] <gahr> neomutt -> {'event': 'new_email', 'data' : { 'subject' ... }} -> your repl -> {'action': 'store_to', 'data': { 'folder' : 'trash' ...}}
[16:59:08] <gahr> so you would have a small shim to implement the protocol in each language, then you'd have a full language at disposal
[16:59:18] <gahr> you could attach a repl, an external program that implements custom logic, etc
[16:59:27] <gahr> I'd love to see that
[16:59:33] <mfiano> Yeah that would be nice.
[16:59:35] <gahr> that'd allow us to get rid of most config
[16:59:41] <gahr> you'd "live config" things as they happen
[17:00:29] <gahr> you could have events for writing entries in the index, too
[17:00:30] <mfiano> Anyway, I think we should focus on cleanup/bugs first and foremost. This was just a passing idea I had for the future.
[17:00:32] <gahr> so you could apply colours, etc
[17:00:44] <gahr> yeah, I'd love a clear IPC
[17:01:18] <gahr> we (are forced to) do crazy stuff with macros because of the lack of an IPC that'd allow us to implement complex logic outside of neomutt
[17:01:37] <mfiano> Did you see my crazy mutt macros?
[17:01:50] <gahr> no, did you see mine? :D
[17:02:01] <mfiano> macro defining macros

[17:03:20] <mfiano> I guess :)
[17:07:36] <gahr> anyway, I'd love to see us define a language-agnostic IPC protocol
[17:08:00] <gahr> so if you want to put some thought into it, you're warmly welcome!
[17:08:14] <mfiano> Yeah. neovim is a nice inspiration in that regard.
[17:09:32] <mfiano> By the way, I think I found either a bug or a documentation issue.
