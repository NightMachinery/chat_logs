[00:21:59] <lenswipe> hey folks
[00:22:29] <lenswipe> upgraded from PHP 7.2 to 7.4 and suddenly I have a Drupal 7 site breaking. The logs say class not found:  DOMDocument
[00:22:49] <lenswipe> if I put new DOMDocument() in a php file and run it from the CLI, that works just fine, but apparently not from apache.
[00:22:56] <lenswipe> I'm thinking that I need to somehow enable something?
[00:26:46] *** Joins: WishBoy (~WishBoy@user/wishboy)
[00:26:58] <__adrian> likely you didn't install that package
[00:27:12] <__adrian> dom is often packages separately
[00:27:18] <__adrian> *packaged
[00:28:45] <AllenJB> Are both commandline and web requests using the same PHP version? Have you restarted Apache / PHP-FPM since updating?
[00:28:48] <lenswipe> __adrian, as I mentioned - I can use DOMDocument just fine from the CLI...and also the output of sudo yum list installed | grep php74 includes "php-xml.x86_64                        7.4.22-1.el7.remi              @remi-php74"

[00:32:00] <lenswipe> AllenJB, yep. 7.4.22
[00:32:06] <lenswipe> and also yes. I've restarted both
[00:39:43] <AllenJB> Compare the output of `php --ini` on the commandline with the top section of phpinfo() from a web request to check where each is getting its configuration from.
[00:41:11] <AllenJB> (on a typical CentOS / Remi setup I have to hand, you should also see the //etc/php.d/20-dom.ini file that contains the Dom extension being loaded)
[00:42:56] *** Quits: joo-_ (~joo-_@fsf/member/joo--) (Quit: Lost terminal)
[00:43:33] <__adrian> lenswipe: again, often packaged separately
[00:43:55] <__adrian> i didn't see you list anything like "php7.4-xml" ?
[00:44:36] <__adrian> and might need to go in your web ini file even if so (but installing usually does that)
[00:45:15] <__adrian> if you installed 7.4 from remi you should be looking for an xml or dom package from remi also
[00:47:09] <AllenJB> Fairly sure that if you've got the repo enabled as per the "single version installed" instructions on Remi's wizard you shouldn't be able to install extensions from elsewhere as they'll conflict

[02:27:24] <Byteflux> you mean $this ?
[02:27:55] <paule32> this is the class itself

[02:31:14] <paule32> $obj_b = new TWindow();
[02:31:40] <paule32> now, i would like "register" the window instance obj_a, and obj_b
[02:31:54] <paule32> can this be done in constructor of TWindow ?
[02:32:15] <Byteflux> depends what "register" means
[02:32:32] <Byteflux> it's probably possible but also may not be the right way
[02:33:03] <paule32> so i should be use external register() function ?
[02:33:10] <paule32> for each instance ?
[02:33:11] <Byteflux> i don't know, it's unclear what you're trying to acheive
[02:33:28] <paule32> store informations about the object
[02:33:33] <paule32> the thing is that:
[02:33:48] <paule32> i have some instances of the same class type
[02:34:08] <paule32> each class contains EmitCode member

[02:34:25] <paule32> this member generates me code
[02:34:40] <paule32> depend on the settings of the new created instance
[02:35:28] <paule32> so let see, you have 2 instances, with same parent
[02:36:32] <paule32> then, you have to call EmitCode twice, one times for obj_a, and one times for obj_b
[02:38:08] <paule32> but i had thinking, that can be done in one call, also "register" the informations of the single instances in the ctor, and at end of the php application call EmitCode, which iterate through a array which contains the instance informations
[02:38:58] <celphi> what's best way to remove trailing zeros and remove commas (it's can be str or float or int)
[02:41:38] <s17> "best" is subjective.  preg_replace() could do that.
[02:43:07] <Sammitch> "can be str or float or int" red flag
[02:43:09] <biberu> rtrim?
[02:43:14] <celphi> `var_dump((float) str_replace("/,/", '', $x));` ?
[02:43:19] <biberu> +1 Sammitch
[02:43:27] <Sammitch> also you probably _actually_ want to do math
[02:43:52] <celphi> is my solution the best ?
[02:44:14] <__adrian> celphi: you have _formatted strings_ that you want to tunr into a float/int?
[02:44:19] <__adrian> *turn
[02:44:34] <Sammitch> !+xy
[02:44:34] <php-bot> The X-Y problem is when you want to do X, but you don't know how. You think you can hack X if you can just do Y, but you don't know how to do Y either. You ask (us) for help with Y. We think Y is a strange problem to want to solve... So just ask us about X. [See: http://xyproblem.info/ ]
[02:45:04] <__adrian> answer: don't accept formatted strings unless you know (with certainty) the format
[02:45:51] <celphi> ya agree., but unfortnuately this site is in the land of no return
[02:46:08] <biberu> what does comma mean in your region?
[02:48:02] <celphi> 100,000 i means after 4 0s you add one after 3 zero
[02:48:26] <Blondie101010> no don't accept that
[02:48:29] <celphi> well 4 places not zeros
[02:48:44] <celphi> every thousands place
[02:48:50] <Sammitch> is this india's nightmare currency formatting again?
[02:48:50] <Blondie101010> don't do that
[02:48:58] <celphi> lmao Sammitch
[02:49:09] <Blondie101010> celphi:  formatting is done in the OUTPUT
[02:49:28] <celphi> A comma is placed every third digit to the left of the decimal point
[02:50:14] <Blondie101010> so you know a lot of people that can't type in numbers without putting 3 position delimiters?
[02:50:16] <Blondie101010> come on!
[02:50:27] <Blondie101010> you will get weird bugs because of that
[02:50:57] <__adrian> celphi: that's not universally so, even discounting typos/weird people
[02:51:30] <Blondie101010> in French, "100,000" would be 100
[02:51:49] <Blondie101010> you really want to do that now?
[02:52:17] <Cheez> doesn't php now support _ as a numeric grouping character? like 1_000_000 === 1000000
[02:52:31] <Cheez> i'm sure i read that in php8 or 7.4 or something
[02:53:19] <Blondie101010> that's a bit besides the point, but a bit intriguing
[02:53:45] <Blondie101010> it's a problem of input validation
[02:54:34] <Sammitch> Cheez: it's usualyl part of the locale, and I think there's a formatter in intl somewhere as well
[02:54:40] <Blondie101010> if you're making a form in JS, you can show your delimiters if you want, without including them in the data sent
[02:54:44] <Cheez> Blondie101010: yeah i just mention it as an asside really
[02:55:08] <Cheez> and it was added in 7.4 - rfc is https://wiki.php.net/rfc/numeric_literal_separator
[02:55:10] <Byteflux> Underscores aren't a locale thing, they're for number literals in code
[02:55:16] <Byteflux> And unrelated to this topic
[02:55:17] <Sammitch> Cheez: *for output only, not for code AFAIK
[02:55:28] <Cheez> Sammitch: for code, it was added in 7.4, see rfc above
[02:55:44] <biberu> you're talking about different things, Cheez and Sammitch
[02:55:57] <Byteflux> Yes the whole _ thing is unrelated to the issue being discussed
[02:56:05] <Cheez> i only really mentioned it as an asside to the whole number formatting thing
[02:56:06] <Byteflux> It's derailing the actual discussion

[03:27:41] <__adrian> "Cheez> doesn't php now support _ ..."  not really relevant, as we're not talking about literals but formatted strings. that is, 1_00 yes but "1_00" no
[03:27:54] <__adrian> celphi: again, decide on formatting you allow
[03:28:09] <__adrian> don't "take anything" and then try to make it make sense.
[03:29:03] <__adrian> tell the user what formats you allow. build your html forms and js checks to help them get the format right.
[03:29:54] <__adrian> e.g., https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/number
[03:36:23] <celphi> is there a good php benchmark site?
[03:36:31] <celphi> to test two differ functions
[03:36:41] <celphi> thnx for feedback __adrian
[03:37:17] <celphi> the script was more so to update values in database

[03:42:01] *** Quits: entuland (~entuland@user/entuland) (Quit: Leaving)
[03:42:39] <__adrian> that means it would be even easier to determine what format(s) you're dealing with
[03:42:58] <Sammitch> the more things that are not your benchmark that the machine is running, the more useless the benchmark. so an online service running benchmarks for a squillion people at once would not exactly produce useful data.

[03:47:46] <Sammitch> uhh wrong channel
[03:49:31] <__adrian> paule32: i don't follow your question at all. BUT i'd venture "no"
[03:49:58] <__adrian> there's nothing about that paste that i would endorse
[03:50:09] <__adrian> maybe  echo "<xmp>";
[03:51:16] <__adrian> for starters, "$instance = new TWindow(); // will return:  "instance";"  // no, it won't
[03:51:42] <__adrian> maybe you could explain what it is you're trying to solve
[03:53:29] <__adrian> celphi: do you know what format(s) you're working with? e.g., do you KNOW for a fact that commas in your DB are always separators? that dots are always decimals?
[03:54:29] <celphi> they're all strings: some with and some w/o commas. it's nowhere near a perfect solution but it's a fast one to standardize all the values in db.
[03:54:40] <__adrian> what about the second question
[03:55:12] <celphi> i mean when would a number have a dot and it not be a decimal?
[03:55:31] <celphi> i mean i guess it's possible
[03:55:43] <__adrian> that question ^ means you don't know enough about numbers and number formats. places other than the USA, exist
[03:55:50] <__adrian> dots can be separators
[03:55:57] <celphi> the site is for USA only
[03:56:24] <__adrian> point is you can look at the database and see what you're dealing with, no need to assume or guess.
[03:57:02] <__adrian> if your assumptions are true, then use filter_var(). FIRST use VILTER_SANITIZE_FLOAT and THEN use FILTER_VALIDATE_FLOAT.
[03:57:02] <celphi> sure i agree., lots of tables and database to do that with though
[03:57:17] <celphi> i like that idea
[03:57:24] <__adrian> you don't have to look at each individually
[03:57:27] <celphi> good safety check
[03:57:32] <__adrian> you can inspect them in aggregate
[03:57:36] <celphi> ok cool thanks for suggestion
[03:57:58] <celphi> ill just try catch and echo errors to log file
[03:58:04] <__adrian> note, this is basically the ONLY situation that i would consider any of the sanitize_* filters acceptable

[11:15:40] <paule32> wut
[11:15:53] <paule32> you mean this thing with instances ?
[11:17:12] <Beryllium> Instances can be serialized to a string and unserialized, so that the instance data can be restored from disk. It's possible, but has drawbacks. Suggesting it ought to automatically trigger a bunch of questions about what's being solved that makes it necessary or beneficial.
[11:18:11] <Beryllium> If you just want to dereference the variable, you might be thinking of variable-variables
[11:18:40] <Beryllium>  In that code example, a variable-variable would be $$key
[11:18:59] <Beryllium> This also ought to raise questions, though :)
[11:19:55] <paule32> i would like to programming a "automatic" register of TWindow class instances in a array

[11:20:25] <paule32> so, i could look to the array, which classes are "register", and make then html code with my generator

[14:32:14] <paule32> hi
[14:37:02] <paule32> when i search for the defined variables, say instances of class(es), i have realize, that, if you use namespace, the "instanceof CLASS" command dont care about namespaces
[14:37:34] <paule32> so, only global CLASS without namespace will be found
[14:37:47] <Naktibalda> it certainly does
[14:37:57] <paule32> e.g.:  \myns\foo_class
[14:38:23] <paule32> ehm: class \myns\foo { ... }
[14:38:41] <Naktibalda> the same name resolution rules apply as in other places where class names are used
[14:38:57] <paule32> the \foo class will be found
[14:39:05] <paule32> if ($value instanceof TWindow) {
[14:39:05] <paule32>  echo  $key . "\n";
[14:39:05] <paule32> 	}
[14:39:16] <Naktibalda> pastebin
[14:39:40] <paule32> yeah, i had think, this issue is know ?
[14:40:36] <paule32> the command above comes into a existing ns
[14:43:22] <Naktibalda> there is no such issue
[14:43:57] <paule32> which version php do you use?
[14:44:12] <biberu> paule32: https://3v4l.org
[14:44:27] <paule32> ah ook
[14:44:29] <Naktibalda> it is up to you to prove that you have an issue
[14:45:08] <paule32> then i have to understand the internals
[14:45:11] <biberu> i strongly suspect that your issue is something else, but without an example we can't tell
[14:45:23] <Naktibalda> no, you don't understand basics
[14:46:02] <biberu> make an example, you might find the real issue while doing so
[14:46:07] <Naktibalda> please create an example with 2 namespaces to demonstate an issue
[14:47:01] <paule32> i have two files with a class, ok this can be done in one, but i only use one - the same ns

[18:00:03] <AllenJB> "Questions to consider" - What exactly do you expect the candidate to do with these?
[18:00:35] <AllenJB> As per previous discussion, this could easily be a relatively short discussion. Not 2 hours of unpaid, poorly defined work.
[18:00:54] <olle> AllenJB: First three are for more senior position. That's why they are system design focused.

[18:04:58] <olle> biberu: Can you elaborate?
[18:05:49] <biberu> e.g. design the solution together with the candidate
[18:05:59] <olle> Yes, exactly.
[18:06:14] <biberu> as opposed to watching the candidate design it
[18:07:20] <olle> Oh yes, sure.
[18:07:35] <paule32> hello
[18:08:36] <olle> I'd have to split the exercises in more smaller questions, perhaps. "Say we are designing a survey software from scratch, with this and that. How'd you design the database? Which ORM? Domain models?" And such.
[18:08:44] <paule32> is it possible to have a function with variable arguments, that are comma seperated, and can add to array, or is it better, to write the array directly as parameter ?
[18:09:06] <olle> paule32: What did you try?

[18:18:28] <AllenJB> paule32: What are you on about?

[18:20:03] <mysteryhunter> i am confused.. a friend just said my website worked but i thought it didnt work could u maybe check if it works mysterynews.tv ?
[18:20:06] <paule32> so, i use a windows server for local development, but share thw internet stuff on a isp
[18:20:17] <paule32> with *nix system
[18:21:12] <paule32> you can dial-in with telephone number, and give the caller a ip
[18:21:27] <paule32> to more lines your have, to more clients can share
[18:22:00] <paule32> or, you connect the computers with local network cards
[18:22:06] <paule32> like lan party
[18:22:13] <AllenJB> mysteryhunter: I get a connection timeout - this indicates there may be a problem with the hosting such as the server, or the web server service being down
[18:22:32] <mysteryhunter> it actually just not work.. thats why i am confused that it works with my friend
[18:22:33] <paule32> or firewall is blocking port
[18:22:41] <mysteryhunter> it actually should not work*
[18:23:48] <paule32> or isp is blocking port 80/443
[18:23:48] <AllenJB> mysteryhunter: If your friend has been to the site previously, it's possible they could be seeing a copy of the site cached by their web browser.
[18:24:00] <mysteryhunter> he hasnt
[18:24:06] <mysteryhunter> first time i show him the site
[18:24:41] <AllenJB> mysteryhunter: How have you blocked the site from being viewed?
[18:25:11] <mysteryhunter> it is linked to a wrong webhost IP
[18:25:19] <mysteryhunter> (to an old)
[18:26:19] <paule32> or dns server can be over 24 hours to collect the information together
[18:26:19] <AllenJB> When did you make the change? The DNS record may be cached and may have not been updated by the DNS server they're using yet. (This should be for the length of the DNS record TTL, but in some cases can be longer with badly behaving DNS)
[18:27:02] <AllenJB> If you want more information on how DNS changes work, read up on DNS propagation
[18:27:05] <Byteflux> this isnt 1999, DNS doesn't take 24 hours anymore.
[18:27:10] <mysteryhunter> [15:56:19] <paule32> or dns server can be over 24 hours to collect the information together
[18:27:14] <mysteryhunter> it is old since months
[18:27:19] <AllenJB> Byteflux: It does if the TTL is 24 hours
[18:27:27] <mysteryhunter> the change was made months ago

[18:30:17] <AllenJB> mysteryhunter: Is it possible they could have set up an entry in their "hosts" file manually?
[18:31:21] <AllenJB> ("hosts" is a file your computer uses for "local DNS" lookups and overrides "normal DNS" - the exact location depends on your OS)
[18:32:05] <paule32> hint: windows 8 and up dont support ipv4 easily any more
[18:32:24] <paule32> so, all local servers have to be ping with ping6
[18:32:59] <AllenJB> paule32: Er, what? That's not true. I run Windows 10 on a pure IPv4 LAN, as do, I would wager, most people
[18:33:01] <Byteflux> that is... absolutely not true.
[18:33:38] <biberu> paule32: what? are you sure you aren't just blocking icmpv4 ping in the fw?
[18:33:44] <paule32> i write easily, my lan here, have ipv6 only
[18:34:20] <AllenJB> paule32: Your LAN setup has nothing to do with what Windows supports, or what other people are using.
[18:34:26] <paule32> the only one that runs with ipv4 is my internet router
[18:34:37] <Byteflux> sounds like a personal problem

[19:52:41] <__adrian> lenswipe: forget about the cli. it's not relevant. did you verify that you installed dom for your webserver, and that it was enabled in the/an ini file?
[19:53:18] <lenswipe> __adrian, php-xml is installed(that IS what provides dom, isn't it?)
[19:53:37] <__adrian> you said you installed php 7.4 from remi.
[19:53:45] <__adrian> so, no, probably not.
[19:53:59] <__adrian> did you look for and install an xml package for 7.4 from remi?
[19:54:06] <lenswipe> well, i can tell you that php-dom isn't a package
[19:54:12] <lenswipe> yes, php-xml is installed

[20:07:19] <__adrian> i don't know for sure, but i'm seeing search results that imply  php-dom  is separate from php-xml in remi. e.g., https://www.cloudbooklet.com/install-php-7-4-on-centos-8-or-rhel-8/

[21:36:41] <sharpertool> I've been trying to setup a session for testing. I have 'example' sessions that work, but I wanted to insert a session in the DB and then use that generated session id in tests. I am able to read the session data from the DB, and then write into the new db record. that works if I jsut read and write the data.
[21:37:33] <paule32> very critical
[21:37:35] <sharpertool> But, I wanted to store those sessions in a file. and, I've tried for 2 hours to read that data from the DB, write to a file, then read the file and write into the test session. I've been unable to read/write that data through a file. The session engine fails to read the result every time.. it's invalid, for reasons I cannot determine
[21:38:05] <paule32> intruder have 2 hours to cheat
[21:38:15] <paule32> read your db
[21:38:20] <sharpertool> I've kind of tried encoding, but maybe I'm not encoding it right.. not sure what the encoding is int he SDB, but it's a 'longtext' field, so it could be UTF8, or, in MySQL it might be utfmb4
[21:38:31] <sharpertool> Any tips??
[21:39:04] <paule32> dont store session ids on sql db
[21:39:49] <paule32> this blows up your db, each connect can break, then you collect artifacts over the time, and your server db will grow and grow

[21:52:22] <lenswipe> the correct place to store sessions is (at a pinch: a database) or...even better some kind of key/value store like redis
[21:52:24] <paule32> that job does php, each instance has own room in memory, and when i need session to store, i use a non web folder

[21:53:19] <lenswipe> if you store your sessions on the server itself, if you're behind a load balancer, every time your users get routed to a different server they'll get logged out
[21:53:29] <Byteflux> sharpertool: Session data is encoded using a special serialization format. You can use session_encode() and session_decode() to mimic the behavior. The encode function encodes the contents of $_SESSION and returns that, the decode function decodes the supplied data into $_SESSION.

[21:56:07] <__adrian> sharpertool: is the file simply for testing purposes?
[21:56:17] <AllenJB> admin0: Do you mean a DateTime object? Either clone it first, or consider using DateTimeImmutable instead
[21:56:32] <admin0> the datetime comes from a php form
[21:56:50] <lenswipe> paule32, the web server you're using is not relevant
[21:57:17] <__adrian> admin0: AllenJB is asking what the data type is (e.g., a string (formatted date), and integer (unixtime), or a dattime instance). not where it "comes from" (that's not relevant)

[21:58:32] <admin0> let me check
[21:58:34] <paule32> yes, you right, you can use iis - from microsoft, you can use microssof iis for ssl, too, with your own self cert
[21:58:51] <paule32> and microsoft can create certs
[21:58:56] <__adrian> paule32: you're not providing on-topic answers
[21:59:00] <lenswipe> you can also use nginx, lighthttpd etc. but none of those are relevant to sessions
[21:59:01] <Byteflux> lenswipe: paule32 is a dead end. best not to engage them
[21:59:12] <lenswipe> Byteflux, starting to realize that
[21:59:22] <lenswipe> Byteflux, one last try
[21:59:46] <lenswipe> paule32, https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.sessionhandlerinterface.php <---- implement that interface and you can control where your sessions end up. Better yet, use a framework because this is a solved problem .
[22:00:06] <paule32> yes, "interfac"
[22:00:30] <admin0> AllenJB print_r provides this: DateTime Object ([date] => 2021-08-01 00:00:00.000000  \n[timezone_type] => 3  \n    [timezone] => Europe/Berlin )
[22:00:42] <admin0> is it possibel to make this object immutable ?
[22:00:42] <__adrian> admin0: my question was, what do you mean by "add ... without mutating", as you're effectively saying you want to change the date without changing the date (this doesn't make sense)
[22:01:10] <__adrian> no. BUT there is a DateTimeImmutable class which you could (arguably should) use instead.
[22:01:21] <Byteflux> DateTime#add() mutates the date time so presumably they want to not do that
[22:01:56] <__adrian> if you don't control the original DateTime object creation, then there is https://php.net/datetimeimmutable.createfrominterface
[22:02:18] <Byteflux> Right, how is the DateTime being created?
[22:02:55] <admin0> __adrian .. ok .. so i have a from that provides a end_date .. whic is hte datetime object .. say its $end_date ; .. now I need to do a loop , find all records in that loop, say 3, and then update with $end_date + 14 .. the issue i found is the first loop modifies this date, and then the 2nd and then the 3rd and its not consistent
[22:03:10] <__adrian> "so i have a from that provides a end_date .. whic is hte datetime object"  this is not correct
[22:03:27] <__adrian> the datetime object is _created using_ inputs from that form.
[22:03:33] <admin0> https://pastebin.com/RHBwSyxB -- maybe this makes sense
[22:03:48] <__adrian> yes, i follow that
[22:04:05] <admin0> so i want to get a consistent labtillPlus14  in all loop runs
[22:04:21] <__adrian> the solution i'd recommend depends on how the dt object is created. e.g., does YOUR code do that? or is it coming from (e.g.) a framework you're using?

[22:04:40] <__adrian> ok
[22:05:00] <admin0> so the question is .. from the date object, is it possbile to create $new_immutable_date  and then i can use that new one
[22:05:04] <__adrian> so, first: look up symfony docs and see if you can make it use DateTimeImmutable instead of DateTime.
[22:05:21] <__adrian> second: if you can't, then you'd use the method i linked above.
[22:05:27] <__adrian> i.e.,   $dt = DateTimeImmutable::createFromInterface($dt); $modified = $dt->modify("+ 14 days");

[22:50:18] <da_wunder> json data is just in request body - not in the $_POST data
[22:52:08] <__adrian> you'd need to parse it yourself.  $data = json_decode(file_get_contents("php://input"), true);

[23:49:51] <__adrian> by extending Son from Father, you're REQUIRING the Son to have a Son of their own.
[23:50:03] <__adrian> because all fathers have Sons.
[23:50:32] <onizu> hmm
[23:50:33] <__adrian> BUT not all Sons have Fathers. that means Sons _are not_ Fathers. Son should _not_ extend from Father.
[23:51:05] <__adrian> interestingly, the opposite might be fine (Father extending from Son (but I likely wouldn't do this either)).
[23:51:59] <__adrian> terms like "father" and "son" are about _relationships_. they should be handled as relationships in code.
[23:52:05] <onizu> i don't understand why the Son (extending Father) must also have a son
[23:52:19] <__adrian> because it extends from Father
[23:53:16] <onizu> but the class Father doesn't say it has a son
[23:53:22] <__adrian> i suppose that's not in your example (a property $son).  but logically, having children is what defines being a parent.
[23:53:24] <onizu> it's only creating one
[23:53:42] <__adrian> explain why you wanted Son to extend from Father
[23:54:33] <onizu> well, the Father is a controller class and I wanted to shove all the form-requests in a formController class and so made it extend the Controller
[23:54:57] <onizu> although now I see that unless the child class calls the parent's constructor, it doesn't really help at all

[23:58:08] <onizu> :) no, I started with class names as Parent, Child in 3v4l, but PHP didn't allow, so I changed the names to Father, Son..
[23:58:54] <__adrian> let's do  https://3v4l.org/Mr8cl
[23:58:59] <__adrian> is this representative?
[23:59:05] <onizu> https://3v4l.org/8v8tk -- even a non-typed property is not accessible in the child class unless the parent's constructor is called
[23:59:21] <__adrian> that ^ is not "not accessible"
[23:59:35] <__adrian> it WAS accessed. its value was null.
[23:59:57] <onizu> ok
