[00:07:37] <[Coke]> wonder how much faster 'zef install HTML::Canvas --deps-only' would be on an M1 mac instead of this ancient beast.
[00:13:19] <ugexe> dont forget it could be slower depending on how much JIT affects it
[00:14:13] <ugexe> although when skipping tests everything was a bit faster in zef (presumably due to the extra cores of the m1 vs the previous gen intel i7 macbook)
[00:14:14] <tonyo> [Coke]: 23s on my m1
[00:14:36] <tonyo> it also failed

[00:26:23] <[Coke]> 'zef look' doesn't respect my path. if I change my PATH, then do a 'zef look', I get my default raku, not the one first in my PATH.
[00:27:38] <tonyo> zef isn't a shell
[00:35:53] <[Coke]> zef launches a shell. I'm saying the env vars aren't being passed in to the invoked shell
[00:36:13] <[Coke]> sorry, "zef look" launches a shell.
[00:54:08] <jdv> why does zef look launch a shell?  weird.  i didn't know about that.
[00:57:09] <ugexe> cause thats what `panda look ...` did heh
[01:03:11] <ugexe> and i imagine panda did that  because cpanm does that
[01:03:43] <jdv> oh
[01:07:46] <[Coke]> ugexe: does it make sense to try to preserve existing shell env vars or should I not expect that? I no longer need it, but will open a ticket if you like
[01:13:13] <lizmat> raydiak++  # fixed
[01:16:59] <ugexe> [Coke]: i'm not sure how that wouldnt already be happening if raku sees it fine since shell passes along %*ENV and the zef look logic is essentially just a 1 liner -- https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/1809160b519f58d3586e8a6ec3525aa9cdb37f53/lib/Zef/CLI.rakumod#L881
[01:25:46] <ugexe> for me it seems to work as you expect
[01:26:24] <ugexe> i.e. if i set `BAR=42` then do `zef look` i can still see BAR as 42
[01:30:29] <[Coke]> could have been user error, for sure.
[01:31:05] <[Coke]> my issue was that when I did "which raku" I got the rakubrew raku instead of the one I had first in my PATH before issuing zef look.
[01:31:49] <ugexe> ah well you probably have something like .bash_profile or some such auto setting that

[11:50:35] <very> hello `combinations` function has `$of` parameter but `permutations` doesn't. How can I find (n, k) permutations? I couldn't install Math::Libsgl::Permutation on windows
[11:51:25] <dakkar> very: I'm pretty sure that you're looking for something different that `permutations`
[11:51:57] <dakkar> "permutations" are (more or less) the different ways of ordering elements in a list
[11:52:32] <dakkar> m:(1..3).permutations.say
[11:52:32] <very> dakkar: Python has itertools.permutations I'm looking for the same thing

[11:52:47] <very> https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.permutations
[11:53:08] <very> it has an `r` parameter
[11:53:18] <dakkar> uh… that's a strange name for a thing that is *not* generating permutations
[11:53:46] <moon-child> ^
[11:53:57] <cnx> iirc in the nPr notation P stands for permutation
[11:54:28] <moon-child> looks like it's effectively x.cominations($of)).map(&permutations)
[11:55:06] <moon-child> cnx: or 'pick' (where nCr is 'choose')
[11:55:40] <cnx> well i could be wrong
[11:58:31] <very> moon-child thanks for it, then I go for `@a.combinations($of).map(*.permutations.Slip).sort`
[11:58:54] <dakkar> aah, I was trying to figure out that `.Slip`
[11:59:34] <very> which seems more inefficient than a built-in `permuations($of)` but I guess there are reasons for not including it
[12:01:56] <dakkar> very: it would perform exactly the same operations… built-ins are not always magical ☺
[12:02:08] <very> but faster, I meant
[12:02:15] <dakkar> not necessarily
[12:02:34] <very> okay then
[12:02:52] <very> but there is sort at the end?
[12:03:16] <very> direct implementation wouldn't have that I believe
[12:03:25] <lizmat> if a builtin is not the fastest, it needs to be fixed  :-)

[12:06:50] <moon-child> recently on a trivial benchmark (file reading) raku was 10x faster than common lisp.  Was because the cl implementation was doing something stupid, but still nice to see!
[12:06:59] <moon-child> then again, dispatch in raku is still 100x slower than cl.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
