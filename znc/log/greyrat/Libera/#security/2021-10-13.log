[01:15:36] <Dixcy> its not cisco and not microtik
[01:16:06] <Dixcy> its cheap brand used by my isp
[01:17:14] <electr0n> then I would be making recommendations blindly without knowing anything about the state of the backups, what is actually backed up, encrypted?
[01:17:26] <electr0n> or even what produced those backups.

[01:23:43] <piou> I mean, sure, but you're probably not going to do that by looking at this one sample, that's a multi-step thing
[01:24:40] <piou> It's very interesting that it's exactly 16 bytes long though, must be light encryption

[01:27:43] <Dixcy> electr0n:  utils  the list support 5 models of my brand but different versions. Is it worth to different version ?
[01:28:33] <electr0n> I would definitely give it a try, usually you do not see changes to the encryption/encoding functions when they just 'work'

[05:24:07] <cursey> i've never had an urge to even attempt to use IDA for .net assemblies. there are .net specific tools that are good enough.

[05:28:09] <sartan> It gave me a bunch of stuff but nothign quite usable
[05:28:30] <Hash> I wonder if Resource Hacker might give some stuff?

[05:30:19] <Hash> If it does the job, maybe worth the cost.
[05:31:30] <cursey> is the game you're looking into obfuscated? even when .net assemblies were obfuscated i was able to glean enough from dnSpy output to do what i needed to
[05:31:46] <cursey> just took some more time
[05:31:57] <sartan> it's not no
[05:34:05] <sartan> i'm able to grab a bunch of json and read some simple headers, but i can't quite look at the item references i need, only pointers to them. i was wondering if there were other packed resources in the binary hiding on me
[05:34:11] <sartan> dnspy found a few more things than ilspy

[19:18:57] <queue[m]> i miss irc, but irc will never be the same again and it will never be as active, it will continue to dissipate and thats the sad part
[19:19:04] <lacroix> anyway, I am missing the point of this conversation? you're promoting matrix etc. Who cares.
[19:19:13] <queue[m]> there used to be a lot more white people online who were all nerds, now  we have diversification and all these females that dont know much

[22:50:52] <mathu> am i right in thinking chaining ROP gadgets requires overwriting the return address of previous stack frames? if you are only 3 frames deep, you can't chain 4 gadgets? / you destroy those previous frames to set up your ROP chain?
[22:52:39] <ajak> why would it return to the previous stack frame?
[22:53:15] *** Joins: mrmanner (~jmanner@h-98-128-201-128.A785.priv.bahnhof.se)
[22:53:36] <mathu> ajak: because gadgets end in returns? i don't see how new frames would be created for the ROP gadgets
[22:53:58] <mathu> you overwrite a return address to initiate the ROP chain, but you can't generate new call instructions or whatever
[22:54:37] <ajak> you can't generate new call instructions yes, and new frames won't be created, no
[22:55:05] <mathu> so, when each gadget runs its ret instruction, the stack pointer gets moved
[22:55:14] <mathu> right?
[22:55:33] <ajak> as i understand it when you get control of the return address you jmp (or whatever) into the address at the return address, then when that code ret's it ret's to the next pointer on the stack

[22:57:14] <ajak> well, to try to avoid mincing words, what RET does is pop the address at the top of the stack and jmp to it
[22:57:23] <ajak> sounds right

[23:00:30] <ajak> yes
[23:00:32] <ajak> i have used pwndbg
[23:01:56] <mathu> so i write my first gadget's address to the stack, and then when my current function returns, i ret and jump to the gadget. my gadget will presumably pop its own locals off the stack and then ret, which requires that i've written another gadget's return address to an earlier location in the stack depending on how much my first gadget pops. i might be able to choose gadgets that call to create more stack
[23:02:02] <mathu> frames if... they also contain bugs to let me overwrite the return addresses they push? so i think there has to be a depth limit to ROP chains based on how many stack frames deep you were at the start

[23:02:25] <mathu> and setting up your ROP chains is a destructive operation; you have to overwrite parts of previous stack frames to set up. right?

[23:03:14] <ajak> yeah buffer overflows are generally destructive
[23:03:32] <ajak> sometimes you can be lucky and set things back up so that the program continues but it's rarely a real concern

[23:06:39] <mathu> gotcha. a page online suggested ROP was good not just because it works around DEP but because it avoids smashing the stack, and i just couldn't think of how that could be possible
[23:06:46] <mathu> looks like i was right :)
[23:06:50] <mathu> thanks for confirming!
[23:07:16] <ajak> well i'm a moron
[23:07:57] <ajak> maybe i'm wrong, but i'd think that any overflow can destroy things that something else might expect to be there

[23:08:41] <ajak> this would be demonstrated by the fact that if you don't figure out a way to cleanly exit your overflow will segfault the program or similar
