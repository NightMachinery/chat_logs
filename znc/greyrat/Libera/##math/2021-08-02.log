[07:52:12] <qergle> so the intuitive progression from Fangs's question is if they add to 1, what happens when you intersect 1 with B

[07:53:03] <qergle> initial universe is 1, new universe is B
[07:54:36] <Fangs> taking "+" as "or" is P(A+B|C) = P(A|C) + P(B|C)?
[07:54:49] <Fangs> I think you need to substract P(A n B | C) from the rhs
[07:55:14] <qergle> mousey: so we have P(A)+P(¬A)=1, this part is clear to you
[07:55:19] <qergle> now consider P(A
[07:55:31] <qergle> now consider P(A∩B)+P(¬A∩B)
[07:56:20] <mousey> ohhh
[07:56:34] <qergle> or if you prefer, forget the probability measure on sets, and just consider the set algebra first: (A∩B) ∪ (¬A∩B)
[07:57:12] <mousey> P(not A and B) is like "everything else"
[07:57:49] <mousey> wait, i drew it >.<
[07:57:51] <qergle> right, P(A and B) is the intersection of A and B. P(not A and B) is the intersection of "everything else other than A" and B
[07:57:54] <mousey> now i see
[07:58:02] <qergle> and their sum is P(B)
[07:58:29] <qergle> yeah, a venn should show it's "B"
[07:59:08] <qergle> the sum ends up being P(B)/P(B) = 1

[11:01:42] <rsonx> Let K  = { <M1,M2>: M1 and M2 are Turing machines such that L(M1) ∩ L(M2) = ø. Suppose that L(N1) = {a,b,c} and L(N2)={d,e} then L(N1) ∩ L(N2) = ø, therefore <N1,N2> ∈ K. Now suppose that there exists a recognizer for this problem and we feed the encoding <N1,N2> then it should accept it. So K is a recursively enumerable?

[12:15:09] <moon-child> Somebody said this: 'The best that one can expect for a set of axioms is that they are consistent, complete, and minimal.  The present set is minimal because none of them can be derived from the others.'  Is that a correct deduction?  It seems wrong to me--a set of axioms might be non-minimal if there exists some other axiom from which can be derived multiple of the axioms in the set
[12:15:53] <riv> yeah you have a point
[12:16:00] <riv> what they really mean is non-redundant

[13:53:10] <bildramer> say you have a switch or gate that works like this: inputs A,B, if wire A is 1, set output wire C=B, else C=0
[13:53:44] <Koen_> that gate is usually called "AND", bildramer
[13:53:47] <bildramer> with a caveat: it only works for approximately 1000 "switches" then the output is random, you don't want that to happen
[13:54:33] <bildramer> how do you build some sort of "meta-gate" that distributes any switching such that it will last longer, say 100000 times?
[13:55:22] <bildramer> I'm considering counting a "switch" as either C changing or A changing. A is more natural, I think
[13:56:54] *** Joins: foobaz212 (~foobaz212@51.188.159.143.dyn.plus.net)
[13:57:16] <bildramer> the problem I see is that whatever the meta-thing is made of, there is a set of gates that will receive the input first, and that set will only last 1000 times, so gates need to only stay in the set for a short time - but the only way to stop an input from passing into one gate is another gate
[14:01:32] <rsonx> Is it okay to use the method of enumeration on words to decide whether a language is decidable or not.
[14:04:00] <Koen_> what's the "method of enumeration on words"?

[14:10:07] <W> bildramer, the only way would be to use the "output is random" in some way
[14:10:29] <W> bildramer, but also, it's hard to tell how you are counting to 1000. 1000 what?
[14:10:57] <bildramer> I didn't mention, assume you can split wires or join them acting as OR, for free
[14:11:03] <W> every gate is used continuously, there's nothing discrete
[14:11:20] <Cyp> No matter what, you'd need at least 100 gates, to multiply the number of switches before failure by 100.
[14:11:43] <bildramer> 1000 times A goes from 1 to 0 or vice versa, or C, depending on which of those, if any, allows this to be an interesting problem instead of just "no can do"
[14:11:57] <bildramer> Cyp: yup, thought as much
[14:11:57] <W> if you pretend these gates are clocked somehow, you're still then only getting 1000 clock pulses unless you decide on some criteria where a gate "isn't used" in a clock cycle

[14:17:05] <W> regardless you can't avoid a probabilistic answer, since "random" can be any number of 0's
[14:17:07] <bildramer> yeah, but whatever multiplexing must occur also involves gates, and those themselves need to not be static, therefore put more gates in front, then also those gates etc. etc.

[14:20:34] <rsonx> In enumeration technique I devise a specific algorithm that goes over the all the strings. I know that it cannot be used formally as there might be better algorithm. But anyways, take for example the language L={<M>: M is a TM and L(M) = ø}, now suppose that ∑ is the input alphabet, we arrange all the string w ∈ ∑* in non decreasing length and in lexicographic order. Now given an encoding of a TM <N> our decider would enumerate one by one over the strings w
[14:20:35] <rsonx> to see if N accepts it. If N accepts w then L(N) ≠ø and our decider would reject <N>. If N rejects w then decider moves to the next string in the list and keep repeating this. Since it is not possible for our decider to accept any encoding <M>, therefore L is undecidable and non recursively enumerable. Notice that our decider can reject strings, this means that the decider for ~L(complement for L) would accept the string that is in ~L. So L is co-Turing

If you have a unit square (square of sides 1) you can half the area and one pair of sides, and halve the area and the other pair of sides; you end up with sides that are halved, and an area that is halved twice

[17:14:11] <buster> You'll see that (d) isn't "smaller" than (c). But the area of (d) is a quarter the area of (b). And the length of (c) is half the length of (a).

[17:19:29] <W> another more practical perspective is that we usually find units so that we deal with decimals > 1, e.g. it's much more common to deal with 3.something than 0.something, and we might even go down a unit to avoid the 0 dot something; this makes it so that we *usually* have a square of a number always be larger than that number, which confuses your intuition when dealing with the range where squaring a number makes it smaller

[17:22:14] <W> e.g. instead of saying a square 0.5m to a side, we might say a square 50cm to a side; 0.5m squared is 0.25 m^2 while 50cm squared is 2500 cm^2; there the difference in units become much clearer too, as while there's 100 cm in 1 m, there's 10000 cm^2 in 1 m^2

[20:21:48] <specing> not really, but e.g in R^2 the equation x = y defines a line, y=x^2 defines a parabola, y = 2, x =3 defines a point. The latter would be a system of 2 equations

[20:25:19] <Franciman> yup
[20:25:24] <Franciman> this one is cooler

[20:27:21] <biberao> yo
[20:27:25] <riv> yo
[20:28:44] <biberao> i have this function y=5-3sin(x/2), what would be the best way to understand when to go from midline down then up etc? i saw a way to use the amplitude but doesnt help much when we're down and need to go up
[20:29:11] * [-_-] is studying now, will get back asap
[20:30:53] <Z-module> well, sin goes between -1 and 1, so -3 sin goes between -3 and 3, so 5 - 3sin goes between 2 and 8 with the midline at 5.  Your y(x) there starts at y(0) = 5, then moves down along a stretched negated sin path.

[20:31:34] <Z-module> and it oscillates at half the speed that sin does, going through a full period every x-interval of 4pi.
[20:31:41] <biberao> yes
[20:32:37] <biberao> so i can do like go to midline then goes to (pi,2) then (2pi,5)
