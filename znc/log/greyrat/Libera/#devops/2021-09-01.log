[19:38:34] <wedr> Hello. I have encountered a peculiar issue related to Apache Tomcat 9 connecting our webapp to the wrong database schema. We have inspected both the Tomcat configuration files, as well as our WAR webapp source codes, XML, and property files to double-check if any misconfigurations were done that would cause this to happen. Thus far, nothing abnormal was found.
[19:39:35] <wedr> What clues can I look for that would suggest the reason it is causing the webapp to connect to a completely wrong database schema? Or what files should I inspect?

[23:41:59] <rawtaz> wedr: i would debug the application itself to determine where it gets the setting from
[23:42:12] <wedr> ok
[23:42:18] <rawtaz> wedr: isolate the problem to find what triggers it
[23:42:49] <rawtaz> theres also a #tomcat channel, quite small though
[23:43:05] <wedr> Yeah, it's small, hence I asked here.
[23:43:56] <rawtaz> but like, i dont see how tomcat itself would cause the wrong database to be used. it should be something in the configuration or if you e.g. connect to a hostname that goes to the wrong db etc
[23:44:20] <rawtaz> its not like tomcat sits there and think "hmm ok they asked for database A, ill just connect them to database B instead \o/". it's not designed to do that :P
[23:44:29] <wedr> I also think it's a configuration issue.
[23:48:58] <wedr> By the way, when booting Tomcat, we inspected the IP address of where it is connecting to via netstat -an. The IP address is XXX at first, but then after a while, the IP address switched automatically over to YYY.
[23:49:38] <wedr> I was confused about how it is redirecting from XXX to YYY after the Tomcat rebooting has completed.
[23:53:18] <rawtaz> well, chec the code of the app. tomcat is just running the code that you load it. so whatever is done, is done due to the code you guys wrote
[23:53:20] <niku> It's pretty unlikely that tomcat has anything to do with it. You need to look at the config file for your java app to see what database it's configured to use, or look at the code
[23:54:30] <rawtaz> if your code isnt behaving the way you expect it to, you need to debug it. it's that simple :)
[23:54:58] <wedr> Wait, code can actually dictate which IP address to redirect to upon rebooting Tomcat? Interesting...
[23:55:20] <niku> It sounds like you're working in an environment that's a more traditional ops / dev split. You should pull the developer in to assist you. 
[23:55:33] <wedr> At the moment, all of our code is using JNDIDataSource and looking up the resource link that is provide by Tomcat.
[23:55:51] <wedr> niku, I'm the developer. :P
[23:57:35] <niku> wedr, then you should probably know what db server you're pointing to. :) Did you define a connection pool maybe?
[23:58:06] <rawtaz> wedr: the code and/or its accompanying configuration is what determines what tomcat does, no?
[23:58:28] <wedr> Our DevOps sent us the server.xml and context.xml of the Tomcat. We never define a connection pool before, as we're only looking up the global naming policy that our DevOps provided to us.
[23:58:51] <wedr> Yeah, the configuration in our source code would be the component connecting to java:comp/env/ourResourceLinkName
[23:58:59] <wedr> but that's all we do. :/
[23:59:47] <wedr> Connection Pool... hmm, let me continue looking up something.
