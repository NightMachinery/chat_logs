[02:31:31] <Oleg> LuisP14: it's very confusing. I don't even understand why good is a countable noun in "...Herd immunity is a collective good". In this context, does "good" have the same meaning as it does in the expression "goods and services"?
[02:36:16] <ksft> Oleg: no, it's different
[02:36:35] <ksft> it's like a substantive adjective
[02:37:10] <ksft> it is unusual, I think, for those to be countable, though
[02:37:14] <LuisP14> it's of the same relation

[02:38:49] <Oleg> I never thought that "harm" could be a countable noun. For me, "much harm will be done" sounds grammatically correct, but "many harms will be done" doesn't
[02:39:37] <ksft> I think the second one could be acceptable if the speaker is distinguishing several discrete harms
[02:46:31] <Oleg> ksft: what do you mean "it's like a substantive adjective"? Substantive adjectives always replace nouns and they are preceded with "the" as in "The English live in London"
[02:47:47] <ksft> here "good" is indeed a noun

[02:51:22] <berndj> tinwhiskers, i know it's rather off-topic but afrikaans has a word for a specifically empty cob!
[02:51:31] <CuriosTiger> I think reading "good" as a regular noun with the meaning "benefit" is a reasonable interpretation of "a collective good".
[02:51:36] <tinwhiskers> berndj: ah. nice
[02:51:44] <berndj> a "mieliestronk" is the bare cob
[02:52:02] <CuriosTiger> which isn't quite the same as "goods" in "goods and service", but also not the same as the adjective "good".
[02:52:37] <tinwhiskers> I would have expected it more from somewhere in South America, but they may have a word for it there somewhere too.

[02:59:54] <grieoippe> I'm proud of you... should I write this to a total stranger?
[03:01:17] <CuriosTiger> That seems a bit familiar for a stranger. I would probably go with "impressed" instead. "I'm impressed at how well you've overcome the hardships you faced", for example.
[03:01:22] <tinwhiskers> commend is a good option
[03:01:30] <tinwhiskers> yeah, or impressed
[03:01:52] <tinwhiskers> proud wouldn't really be appropriate for someone you don't know well
[03:01:54] <grieoippe> is commend more BR or AM?
[03:02:08] <CuriosTiger> Both use it.
[03:02:19] <tinwhiskers> it's a bit stuffy and formal compared to impressed, so I'm guessing more BR :-)
[03:02:20] <CuriosTiger> I don't think it's "more" one or the other.
[03:08:36] <Oleg> if "harm" is countable in the expression "a collective harm", then I find it surprising. The internet has lots of examples for "much collective harm", and very few examples for "many collective harms".
[03:09:20] <CuriosTiger> The distinction is a bit subtle.
[03:09:56] <CuriosTiger> If you need to enumerate different types of harm, then using the plural can be appropriate. That's usually seen in language that is very formal and explicit. Like an insurance policy, for example.
[03:10:41] <CuriosTiger> English has a number of cases where otherwise uncountable nouns become countable in specific situations.

[12:15:33] <kurahaupo> Oleg: apropos your question about "type of a", the broad rule is that the acceptable subphrase structures is normally determined by the verb, or for verbs without a direct object and with certain prepositions (including "of"), by the adjective used in place of a direct object. Essentially we have mental categories for verbs and adjectives that allow or disallow certain following constructions. Which of course leads to corner cases where 
[12:15:34] <kurahaupo> different people put the same verb in different categories 
[12:17:42] *** Joins: dracula (~dracula@117.222.67.198)

[12:28:39] <kurahaupo> Oleg: goods & harms can be countable when referring to categories of actions; "stabbing and lying are harms you can do to someone"
[12:30:55] <kurahaupo> totenkoph: I would use "rewrite", but other dialects might disagree. However it's "on the99,99 condition"
[12:31:17] <kurahaupo> tokam: "reprimate" would mean to return to a state of being, having, or being populated by primates (possibly as a result of reclassification of the extant animals)
[12:31:31] <kurahaupo> (repeated since you've just joined)
[12:31:46] <tokam> should I learn this word_
[12:32:21] <kurahaupo> no, it's an inferred regular construction; re+ verb
[12:32:52] <kurahaupo> whatever "to primate" means, "to reprimate" means to do it again
[12:34:51] <kurahaupo> however "primate" is a noun, and strongly so, so you need to figure one of the standard implicit verb uses such as "become a ___" or "fill with ___" or "classify as ___" or whatever
[12:35:51] <kurahaupo> Any regular implicit verb is grammatically valid but only a few are semantically sensible
[12:35:52] <tokam> Thank you so much
[12:36:09] <kurahaupo> Much more likely is that it's a typo
[12:37:03] <kurahaupo> "primate" is also an ecclesiastical rank
[12:37:49] <kurahaupo> so "be appointed to the rank of primate again" is another possible meaning of "reprimate"
[12:38:18] <kurahaupo> However if that's the intended use, I would tend to hyphenate "re-primate"
[12:41:04] <totenkoph> kurahaupo: alright 
[12:43:09] <kurahaupo> but "reprimand" and "reprobate" seem much more likely terms

[18:12:55] <neiluj> Hello! What do you think of this sentence: `I learned two valuable lessons from this: learning the innards of a full-scale industrial codebase running live and safety-critical code was rewarding -- and it also brought home to me how just one tiny mistake in a distributed system can corrupt the entire network!`
[18:13:29] <neiluj> ?
[18:15:59] <darsie> "and safety-critical code was rewarding" doesn't perfectly fit there, IMHO.
[18:16:50] <neiluj> amazing, perhaps? Though it sounds too much. And honestly I didn't feel this way.

[18:17:53] <dskdn> it's even more funny than "sandscript"
[18:18:03] <neiluj> Yeah, I didn't write this sentence. That's a technical writer which added this.
[18:18:40] <neiluj> I find it too long, not 'natural', plus that `--` disturbs me.

[20:04:38] <kurahaupo> Rashad: I would say "clothes" as /klōðz/ or /klɵ̄ðz/. I'm not clear why you mention "claws" as it clearly differs both in the vowel and the lack of "th" as /ð/
[20:05:10] <Rashad> yeah I was trying to "eliminate" the th sound
[20:06:47] <Rashad> because it is hard to say
[20:06:57] <Rashad> ok so I will come back to this in 10 years and maybe I will figure it out
[20:07:48] <Rashad> I can say cloves but I can't say clothes 
[20:08:10] <blkshp> Close.
[20:08:39] <Rashad> don't you have to bring your tongue to your teeth to say the "th"
[20:08:51] <Rashad> and it is awkward changing directly from that to an "s" sound
[20:08:55] <Rashad> without a vowel in between
[20:08:56] <blkshp> if you want to say it properly.
[20:09:08] <blkshp> I don't say it properly. It ends up as close.
[20:10:04] <Rashad> ok *thank you!*
[20:10:18] <Rashad> I am not crazy after all
[20:10:38] <Rashad> And I also believe some native speakers cheat by saying "fink" instead of "think"
