[15:12:13] <Joanna> Hi everyone
[15:16:18] <Joanna> I’ve never played Minecraft but if I did I would probably want to use it to create architecture

[17:06:23] <lts> Minecraft allows you to selfhost your own server. I wish other games would do that also
[17:20:28] <Joanna> I guess that’s good I don’t know much about it apart from watching stampy longnose videos
[17:30:12] <critr> it worls well on a lan or on an internet connection with good upstream bandwidth, if you don't mind exposeing your ip adress.

[18:02:47] <critr> it's a great way to meditate, sort of mindless. i like it for that.

[20:38:16] <jan6> 15:36 <lts> Minecraft allows you to selfhost your own server. I wish other games would do that also
[20:38:23] <jan6> surprisingly LOTS of games do
[20:39:22] <jan6> sadly most of the times you have to setup a dedicated server package though, so not as easy as just "join on LAN"
[20:40:59] <jan6> also fun fact, minecraft singleplayer is literally a localhost server with a bundled client, so you're always running the "server" when you play ;P
[20:42:43] <jan6> also minecraft visual style is intended to be basic and blocky, but, you can always install a fancy texturepack that includes 3d models, and some shaders, and possibly some mods, and it's almost like a different game
[20:49:37] <jan6> like, idk, something like this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zbq6NPRF1hc
[20:54:33] <technonerd> how much dedodated wam does it need?
[21:00:53] <jan6> who knows
[21:01:13] <jan6> probably not too much

[23:53:33] <CalimeroTeknik> I was rather interested in this case study of how Bill Gates single-handedly managed to make covid vaccines proprietary https://invidious.snopyta.org/watch?v=x80EbmX5xys
[23:54:54] <CalimeroTeknik> I see it as important for security on a social scale to identify, point and fight back on such initiatives
