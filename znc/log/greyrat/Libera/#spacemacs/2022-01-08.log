[01:24:24] <FromGitter> <mathpunk> Magit has been seeming real broken for me lately. It's the only way I know how to rebase. Is there a guide for how to get it to work like it was working a month or two ago?
[01:41:42] <FromGitter> <mathpunk> hey thanks, I missed this earlier!
[01:44:12] <FromGitter> <mathpunk> In particular, I don't know what `, c` and `, k` were mapped to, for executing or aborting the rebase todos
[01:46:23] <FromGitter> <erichlf> You could try `SPC SPC` and then start typing magit...
[01:48:43] <FromGitter> <mathpunk> I did but I don't know what those commands were called. Any idea?
[02:10:56] <FromGitter> <mathpunk> oh hey, that keystroke worked! I think some shortcuts I added must have fixed things

[15:00:58] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I also don't know, but generally I think these things are bound to `C-c C-C` and `C-c C-k` also. If you'd like to cancel a 'rebase process' then you can open the rebase transient (press `r`) and choose `abort` or something like that

[21:57:09] <FromGitter> <davidpiano> @wolfv6 For inserting a plain blank line below, one way might be to go to normal mode and type "] SPC" (i.e. a closing square bracket followed by a space). Also, doing the same but with the other bracket - "[ SPC" - should give a blank line above. This method doesn't move the cursor (it inserts the new line without going to the new line), so I can't say if it's any faster or better than what you were doing 
[21:57:09] <FromGitter> ... before.
[22:46:46] <FromGitter> <alex-ilin> I can't reproduce that as well. I think what happened was that `company-dabbrev-code` was timing out and showing a shorter list of completions, sometimes containing only one word `begin`. ‚èé I have submitted a PR to the `company-mode`: https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/pull/1293 ‚èé It makes the behavior much better: the fully matched (shorter) word is always on top, thus preselected.
