[07:13:01] <codebam> how do I fix them locally
[07:13:19] <codebam> if I merge staging it's already up to date
[07:13:33] <codebam> and I can ff if I try merging into staging so I don't understand

[19:36:15] <cousteau> cbreak: it looks an awful lot like a tree though... but I guess you're right
[19:36:51] <cbreak> it looks like a tree until you merge :)
[19:36:58] <cousteau> If it were a pure tree it would defeat the purpose of making "branches", which is to merge them later
[19:36:58] *** Joins: lpapp_ (~lpapp@1F2E4A7A.catv.pool.telekom.hu)
[19:37:17] <cbreak> also, git supports orphan branches
[19:37:29] <cousteau> But then again, if "trunk" is a stupid name, then so is "branch"
[19:37:55] <cbreak> yeah.
[19:39:28] <cousteau> And, using this tree-inspired nomenclature, it makes a lot of sense to refer to the "main branch" as the "trunk"
[19:41:23] <cousteau> And, for some reason, "The Rattling Bog" song is now stuck in my head

[19:45:02] <cousteau> Yeah, that's what "master" probably meant.  The "golden reference", not the "thing that rules over other branches".  If anything, it's the other way around: branches innovate, master learns from them and follows them

[19:47:54] <Arsen> it makes sense in my workflows
[19:48:10] <Arsen> tags are releases
[19:48:18] <cousteau> Well if there's a single branch then I guess
[19:48:30] <Arsen> either that or there's no release and the repo is "rolling": master is the version intended for use
[19:49:03] *** Quits: lpapp_ (~lpapp@1F2E4A7A.catv.pool.telekom.hu) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[19:49:58] <cousteau> Yeah that'd be the SVN approach, where branches were so awful they'd hardly ever be used, leading to a perfectly linear history with sequential commit numbers
[19:51:33] <cousteau> And for a one-person project, unless you have the (not officially diagnosed) level of ADHD I have, you'd probably be working in one thing at a time, and thus not need branches
[19:51:59] <Arsen> linear histories have various advantages
[19:52:28] <Arsen> I only branch when I have reason to conflict with current work, or when merging other peoples concurrent work, and I rarely merge in favor of rebase
[19:53:44] <cousteau> I'm easily distracted so I'm likely to move "side quests" to separate branches and then merge them, for the sake of cleanliness.  Still makes for a mostly linear history.
[19:55:56] <cousteau> But having the possibility (but not the requirement) to have branches that can be merged painlessly is what makes git and the like great tools.  I didn't really appreciate this until I had to use SVN
[19:57:15] <cousteau> I've also seen projects that force --no-ff merges as a way to group multiple commits into a single one (without squashing them)
