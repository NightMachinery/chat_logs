[07:49:03] <pavonia> Depends on the question
[07:50:21] <lantech19446> ok so i'm just beginning to work on a site and I want my header all the way at the top of the page but i have a margin above it that doesn't go away even with setting margin to 0 or padding to 0
[07:50:21] <lantech19446> https://codepen.io/lantech19446/pen/yLXNvPQ
[07:55:48] <theskillwithin> lantech19446 https://codepen.io/theskillwithin/pen/WNOvMJy
[07:57:23] <lantech19446> ok so was it the body that moved it up or selecting the header and h1?
[07:59:08] <theskillwithin> well its in a codepen, delete one and see, then delete the other and see
[08:00:14] <lantech19446> ok
[08:00:46] <lantech19446> yea I'm using vscode for it but I saw somewhere that codepen or a pastebin is preferred here
[08:01:29] <theskillwithin> if u have a reset or normalize loaded before, might not need to worry about the body one
[08:01:34] <theskillwithin> https://csstools.github.io/normalize.css/
[08:04:01] <lantech19446> so i'd just link both css files to my index?
[08:04:29] <lantech19446> sorry i'm still really new at this i just did my first classes in css tonight
[08:14:48] <theskillwithin> ah ic, Nice!

[08:15:26] <theskillwithin> he did provide a codepen....
[08:15:27] <FunkyBob> opps... sorry
[08:15:29] <FunkyBob> yeah
[08:15:38] <FunkyBob> brain somehow read that as pastebin
[08:15:43] <theskillwithin> hehe
[08:16:12] <FunkyBob> so you pointed out the fact html/body often have a default padding/margin?
[08:16:36] <theskillwithin> i did not get into user agent stylesheet stuff, i just mote sent a codepen back
[08:17:05] <FunkyBob> yah, and that Hx have default margins... exactly
[08:17:16] <theskillwithin> and then i probably confused them after that
[08:17:28] <FunkyBob> normalize and other resets are useful... but understanding the cause is better :)
[08:17:36] <theskillwithin> ya
[08:17:50] <FunkyBob> some quick poking with the browser inspector can be very enlightening
[08:18:05] <lantech19446> theskillwithin: you still helped me I understand better what i need to do now, and i'm sure as i get deeper into my class stuff like that will be explained too
[08:18:30] <FunkyBob> ah... schoolwork :)
[08:18:37] <lantech19446> well udemy
[08:18:45] <FunkyBob> learn to use the inspector...
[08:18:54] <theskillwithin> yes
[08:18:59] <FunkyBob> to see styles applied to an element, what's overriding what,  resultant sizing,
[08:19:05] <lantech19446> i'm a network admin and my coworker who helped with all the website stuff left so i offered to learn and eventually help out with it

[17:10:01] <thykka> which profile are you validating against?
[17:10:50] <thykka> I just tried ":root { --my-color: #0004; }" and it passes validation with CSS3+SVG profile
[17:12:25] <thykka> okay I C.. with errors for vendor extensions selected, it will indeed throw for the custom prop
[17:13:57] <phryk> thykka: CSS3 + SVG
[17:14:26] <thykka> looks like it is still being maintained https://github.com/w3c/css-validator/commits/main
[17:14:47] <thykka> and there are lots of issues about custom props
[17:15:46] <hassoon> birkoff: yep
[17:15:48] <phryk> Do you know any better linter/validator?
[17:16:10] <thykka> stylelint is quite popular
[17:16:52] <thykka> I mostly use Sass, so it's scss-lint for me
[17:17:42] <phryk> no freebsd package for stylelint.
[17:18:10] <thykka> it's an npm package
[17:18:41] <phryk> I try to avoid npm^^
[17:19:09] <phryk> but yeah, that's a fallback i guess.
[17:19:09] <thykka> i guess just clone it from github then
[17:19:12] <thykka> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[17:19:42] <thykka> ..or use yarn :P
[17:21:34] <phryk> actually, i was trying to triage/debug an issue with position: sticky; that only shows up on mobile. it acts… weird. like, when i frist visit the page, i can scroll right past the sticky positioned element, until i tap it to open the menu and after that it mostly sticks fine, but sometimes even then when i scroll around the sticky element is left behind.
[17:22:31] <phryk> i already read about problems with flexbox and overflow and removed any display: flex and overflow definitions from the CSS for testing purposes, but the issue persists…
[17:23:20] <phryk> i encounter it on both firefox and chrome, the browsers are current (versions 91 & 92) but I'm on some ancient android phone, so I'm not even sure my testing is representative…

[21:11:35] <roadie> how do folks 'spread' the image widths for mediaqueries? Should the medium be lower than the small-2x ? (I thought I'd have small, medium, large and xlarge - and for each a 2x retina version). is that enough?
[21:14:39] <roadie> asking because I copied some values and my medium.jpg is 516px which is small.jpg (258) in the 2x retina version...

[22:25:44] <lantech19446> I'm coding my first site and right now I'm extending 2 background-color elements to the end of the page using padding but I know that's not the right way to do it, I just don't know what the right way is. Can someone enlighten me

[22:37:59] <phryk> Is it possible to hide elements dynamically with flexbox or grid layouts? I thought flex-shrink: 0 would accomplish it, but apparently i thought all wrongabout flex-shrink…
[22:38:16] <lantech19446> nm I figured out width: 100%;
[22:39:22] <phryk> lantech19446: also, if it can be wider than that min-width: 100%; or to make sure you never use units relative to the parent use 100vw – vw is a unit that's 1% of the viewport (i.e. the displays) width.
[22:39:52] <phryk> (min-width sets a minimum width but allows the element to grow further than that if the content makes it necessary)
[22:40:10] <lantech19446> it sounds like you're telling me that even set to width: 100%; it can be smaller than the display?
[22:41:55] <lantech19446> only problem is 100vw puts it off my screen partially
[22:42:04] <phryk> depending on the css for the elements parents, yes.
[22:42:47] <phryk> that probably means you have some padding in there. box-sizing: border-box; should fix that – makes height/width include padding and borders.
[22:43:00] <lantech19446> ok

[22:46:06] <lantech19446> only top padding on the part that's off the screen and box-sizing didn't do anything to it

[22:48:59] <lantech19446> padding right 1% seems to have fixed it
[22:49:44] <lantech19446> I might need that box tip for the header though
[22:50:47] <lantech19446> wtf that's making it even shorter on my phone
[22:52:27] <phryk> body { margin: 0; } – body has a non-zero margin by default so text isn't flush against window borders.
[22:54:08] <lantech19446> I have that in the body already as well as in the header
[22:58:31] <phryk> on the site you linked there's only body {} without anything in there. also you have <body> twice in your html.
[22:59:08] <lantech19446> I changed it just now to see if it was fucking with anything, I think I figured out why it's not working though. I put it in the css section just for header not for header h1
[22:59:59] <lantech19446> nm that wasn't it, let me go fix the body error though
[23:01:39] <phryk> ^^
[23:01:43] <lantech19446> it's frustrating because it's perfect on my desktop it's on my phone that the red isn't extending all the way
[23:02:18] <phryk> heh, got a similar situation with position: sticky; being broken when i test on my phone
[23:02:48] <lantech19446> so is this something i just cure with bootstrap eventually and write it off as a weird thing phones do?
[23:04:57] *** Joins: pavonia (~user@user/siracusa)
[23:17:20] <phryk> something as basic as padding probably not. you might want to try clearing browser data on your phone to make sure it doesn't use a cached version of the css.
