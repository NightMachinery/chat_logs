[02:15:52] <red82> I have an image that is width 100%; height auto, object-fit contain.  and occasionally it overflows it’s parent.   from what I am reading, this is happening because its parent (or some ancestor) must have either a width or max width defined, or else auto will fail.

[14:55:46] <dev4449> hi. good day.
[14:56:42] <hassoon> birkoff: what is it
[14:57:52] <dev4449> In a flex container, imagine there are only two flex items. if I specify flex: 2; for the first item, and flex: 3; for the second item. does it mean the first item takes up 2/5 of the available space and the second takes up 3/5?
[15:00:51] <hassoon> dev4449: try it in a fiddle and see
[15:04:50] <dev4449> hassoon: I actually did. I want to make sure this formula is correct: the value of flex property/ the sum of the values of all items' flex property
[15:07:07] <hassoon> ah i see
[15:07:24] <hassoon> you can come to a formula if you make a test fiddle anyway
[15:07:36] <hassoon> observation is your friend
[15:09:10] <dev4449> okay
[15:11:50] <FunkyBob> dev4449: AIUI flex is to do with the ratio at which they're alotted the remaining spacec
[15:11:55] <FunkyBob> after their basis size
[15:12:55] <FunkyBob> so if they start at basis siize 0, then yes, they wiill get 2/5 and 3/5 the space

[15:22:00] <dev4449> I was able to make sure the formula is okay by using the computed width the dev tools gave me.
[15:22:31] <dev4449> the width of the content area of the two flex items yield that the formula is correct.
[15:22:56] <wombawomba> I'm trying to build a responsive grid with either two or four columns depending on screen width, with a gap between the second and third columns. Is this doable?
[15:23:13] <dev4449> thanks
[15:23:49] <dev4449> thanks FunkyBob, hassoon
[15:27:52] <wombawomba> I managed to do it without the gap, and figured I should be able to do something like 'grid-template-columns: [a-start] auto [a-end b-start] 1fr [b-end] 10px [a-start] auto [a-end b-start] auto [b-end]' and using `column: a` and `column: b` for the children, but that doesn't seem to work (it seems duplicate names aren't supported, so all children end up in the first two columns)
[15:34:49] <birkoff> why does horizontal scrollbar is not usable here : https://jsfiddle.net/vpce7uLm/  ?
[15:34:55] <birkoff> the scrollbar is not visible
[15:35:01] <birkoff> nor can I scroll by other means
[15:36:29] <hassoon> birkoff: which element do you expect to be scrollable ?
[15:37:08] <hassoon> wombawomba: sum up the 2nd and 3rd ones in another gapped grid
[15:37:21] <hassoon> wombawomba: grid gap is applicable to the whole layout, not parts of it
[15:41:24] <wombawomba> hassoon: sorry, not sure I understand...
[15:41:35] <wombawomba> what do you mean by 'sum up'?
[15:42:31] <wombawomba> are you suggesting I do some sort of nested grid?
[15:42:36] <hassoon> wombawomba: yep
[15:42:45] <wombawomba> how would that look?
[15:43:36] <hassoon> so you want it 4 columned for larger screen sizes, and 2 columned for smaller screen sizes ?
[15:43:45] <wombawomba> correct
[15:46:40] <hassoon> what about the gap between the 2nd element and 3rd element for small screens ?
[15:46:45] <hassoon> you got 2 elements there
[15:46:55] <hassoon> * 2 columns
[15:47:20] <wombawomba> yeah I only want the gap when there's four columns

[15:50:20] <wombawomba> (etc for `4n+2` and `4n+3`)
[15:50:29] <wombawomba> that should take care of the layout for large screens

[18:02:36] <entuland> never use line-height for such things
[18:02:43] <entuland> that's not what it is for
[18:02:47] <entuland> use proper layouts and placement
[18:03:01] <entuland> such as absolute / relative, flex and grid, depending on the cases
[18:03:18] <FlorianBad> sure, but still, where is that offset coming from?
[18:04:30] <FlorianBad> that distance between the red line and the yellow one is a mystery to me
[18:04:38] <entuland> I'm trying to find out
[18:05:31] <entuland> probably the inline-block
[18:05:46] <entuland> if you change the A to block, it moves and somewhat overlaps the red line
[18:05:54] <entuland> but all in all, that looks like a mess
[18:08:18] <FlorianBad> :)
[18:09:06] <FlorianBad> That makes little sense though, an inline-block within a line-height:0 should be vertically centered. Using block instead should make it much worse in theory
[18:09:34] <entuland> no idea, I only know that you shouldn't use line-height for that
[18:09:57] <entuland> flex with justify-content or align-content to baseline works like a breeze (depending on what you want)
[18:10:13] <FlorianBad> ok. So how could you vertically center a simple button without using all the complex solutions most people use
[18:10:20] <FlorianBad> ah, ok
[18:11:09] <entuland> I keep forgetting and learning flex and grid over and over again, I normally end up on pages like this to get a quick reminder of what is what and for: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/
[18:12:04] <entuland> today I remember that align-items on the parent flex changes the alignment of all the children and align-content is just a shortcut for align-self on all the children, but tomorrow I'll forget about it and I'll have to google that up again :P
[18:12:17] <FlorianBad> ah, love that link! hmmm, it looks good
[18:13:00] <FlorianBad> lol
[18:15:18] <entuland> look, I also managed to bork that - align-items on the parent is the equivalent of align-self on all the children at once, not align-content...

[18:16:11] <FlorianBad> this flex thing is amazing, I did use it in the past but I honestly did not understand it ;)  It's probably something worth mastering
[18:16:32] <entuland> indeed, grid and flex are killer once you get to grasp how they work
[18:17:06] <entuland> until you forget as I normally do, but that's just a search away from learning it again :P
[18:20:05] <FlorianBad> :)  Ok, thank you entuland!

[21:49:58] <entuland> FlorianBad, probably not a big deal, the time needed to compute and render the markup applying the rules will likely be higher than the time needed to alter that stylesheet via JS
[21:51:47] <FlorianBad> entuland: ok! Now, I suppose there is no easy way to grab a rule previously added based on its selector? I basically have to keep the rule index saved?
[21:52:40] <FlorianBad> because let's say for example that this is a menu and someone edits a color. I'm not gonna keep adding rules every time they edit the color, so I have to go remove the existing one first
[21:52:57] <FlorianBad> (first or probably right after rather)
[21:53:18] <entuland> pretty much, yes, you need to keep references if you want to alter them
[21:54:12] <FlorianBad> ok, and then I also need a counter that keeps track of how many I deleted and where... hmmm.... because as soon as I remove a rule it affect all others
[21:55:00] <FlorianBad> it makes the thing a bit heavy. I'll have to go edit a whole array of all selectors every time I delete one
[21:56:11] <entuland> make tests - the references should remain valid even if you remove rules from the array
[21:56:27] <FlorianBad> but at least it's possible, which I'm really glad about
[21:56:34] <entuland> just like if you put objects in an array, the references to those objects will remain valid even if you sort or alter the array
[21:56:38] <FlorianBad> it offers so many possibilities
[21:57:18] <FlorianBad> entuland: hmm, you mean that styleSheet.insertRule returns a reference I can then use? I thought we could only refer to a rule with its index
[21:57:49] <entuland> no, wait, that return value is the index, not the rule
[21:57:50] <FlorianBad> yeah no I think it's all based on index of rules
[21:58:12] <Rockwood> good night
[21:58:18] <entuland> then you're out of luck and you'll have to mess with indices
[21:58:22] <entuland> night, Rockwood
[21:58:51] <FlorianBad> entuland: that's fine, at least it's possible. I just have to figure out a nice way of dealing with this
[21:59:41] <entuland> since it will end up in a CSSRuleList, you may still be able to alter them
[21:59:50] <entuland> and to keep references
[21:59:56] <entuland> you really just have to test
[22:00:25] <FlorianBad> entuland: I basically want to build my presonal library of html content creation, like menus, lists, etc. that I can then reuse anywhere. By calling a javascript function I'll add a section to the menu, collapse it, change its color, etc. by my own way, not with some silly jQuery and such
[22:01:01] <entuland> that's pretty much the same thing I'm doing, but I'm keeping the CSS separated
[22:01:15] <FlorianBad> entuland: ok :)
[22:01:29] <entuland> the really useful thing in such approach is that you let JS create the DOM elements, add listeners and whatnot, at most add classes
[22:01:42] <entuland> I don't think it's really useful and flexible to have JS mess with the styling
[22:01:54] <FlorianBad> over the years I realized how silly it became to write a hundred times the same thing rather than having everything handled by functions
[22:02:02] <entuland> that way, you can completely restyle a running page just switching the stylesheet
[22:02:19] <entuland> I agree with that, but only as to what concerns the DOM, not the styling
[22:02:31] <entuland> I think that they should be kept separated
[22:03:03] <FlorianBad> interesting perspective, I need to give it more thought
[22:03:32] <entuland> even functionally important CSS declarations (say, something that needs to be positioned absolutely) I put in a CSS file
[22:04:01] <entuland> I just make a dedicated CSS file for the functionality rules, and all the rest about the styling, colors, padding and whatnot, I put in a "theme" stylesheet or something
[22:04:38] <entuland> after all such functionally-important CSS rules aren't supposed to be customized by the user
[22:05:02] <entuland> and you seldom if ever find yourself in need to alter them on the fly when creating different instances of the same widget
[22:05:11] <FlorianBad> hmm, ok. I was just gonna end up putting all the styling vars in a common place on the back-end, but then handled by the javascript
[22:05:14] <entuland> if I need the behavior to change, I use classes
[22:05:53] <FlorianBad> Ah, british? :)
[22:05:56] <entuland> the main point is that messing with CSS via JS is normally just more verbose and less efficient for no meaningful gain
[22:06:03] <entuland> british?
[22:06:15] <FlorianBad> ah no, montreal?
[22:06:44] <entuland> I'm Italian, if you refer to my spelling, I don't really pay attention to it :P
[22:07:10] <FlorianBad> ok. "seldom" is seldom american, that's why ;)
[22:07:21] <entuland> oh
[22:07:21] <Rockwood> English is horrible thing of the world :D
[22:07:50] <FlorianBad> Ok I think you might be right, messing around too much with css via js might become a bit heavy
[22:08:00] <entuland> yeah, I don't pay attention to that either - once I learn the meaning of a word, I just use it if needed :P
[22:08:36] <FlorianBad> entuland: I remember many years ago looking at the code of soundcloud and be shocked by the fact that their whole DOM content was handled by javascript
[22:09:01] <FlorianBad> (but probably not styles)
[22:09:11] <entuland> I'm fine with that - I'm actually creating a system right now where my HTML pages don't even have a <body> or a <title>
[22:09:34] <entuland> as I'm going to add them via JS anyways
[22:09:50] <entuland> wait, I'm not even adding the body, I'm letting the browser create it for me
[22:10:03] <Rockwood> JS is beautiful magic :D
[22:10:18] <entuland> same for the title, I'm just setting document.title or something
[22:10:36] <FlorianBad> entuland: haha, I love that kind of radical approach
[22:11:39] <entuland> for the way I have to create this system, the html files are pretty much just a necessary evil, so I'm minimizing what goes there: https://i.imgur.com/b2eJ6cF.png
