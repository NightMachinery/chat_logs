[02:19:41] <Roey> nice links *
[02:19:43] <Roey> above
[02:24:34] <Joanna> Any new developments?
[02:32:07] <Roey> - got rejected by a girl I had met recently. BUT
[02:32:22] <Roey> - I got positive news about my interview yesterday and hope to see an offer letter from them.
[02:33:25] <Joanna> Better to be rejected than get into a relationship that would fail. Congratulations on interview

[03:38:45] <CalimeroTeknik> jan6, six entire minutes to explain tracker pixels? eh.
[03:38:56] <jan6> yuuuup
[03:39:15] <jan6> it's great to share to less techy people tho
[03:39:20] <CalimeroTeknik> in that time I can explain how to solve the energy problem of mankind in a way that probably doesn't even create weapons
[03:39:33] <jan6> > probably
[03:39:37] <jan6> it sure will at that rate
[03:40:06] <CalimeroTeknik> well, kinda, and kinda not https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_Pulsed_Power_Facility
[03:40:22] <jan6> also energy problem is really simple, but nobody wants to fix it
[03:40:30] <CalimeroTeknik> the reason there are no news since 2013 is, of course, that the military are onto it
[03:40:32] <jan6> just enforce power quotas ;P
[03:40:48] <CalimeroTeknik> well, this is about enforcing nothing and just producing moar cake
[03:41:09] *** Quits: s1gyn (~s1gyn@user/s1gyn) (Quit: WeeChat 3.0.1)
[03:41:30] <CalimeroTeknik> they figure that before we run out of hydrogen to fuse into iron, we'll have avoided much more dire issues
[03:41:36] <jan6> sure, sure, increase power forever
[03:42:10] <jan6> and in 100 years we'll be cyborgs who use more power than a fridge, in a day
[03:42:44] <CalimeroTeknik> https://i0.wp.com/what-if.xkcd.com/imgs/a/13/laser_pointer_more_power.png
[03:42:49] <jessicara> if the future is consuming entire suns for power
[03:42:58] <jessicara> we have a lot of waste to catch up on
[03:44:11] <CalimeroTeknik> and if we can generate enough gravity we can also get rid of problematic nuclear waste, according to certain theories
[03:44:51] <CalimeroTeknik> although I'm not sure that the ensuing set of problems, involving speculation that goes by the word "black hole", would be better than the set of problems we started with
[03:45:36] <jan6> just throw the waste into a black hole, and set up a perimeter defense to keep normal stuff out of it! ;P
[03:46:11] <jessicara> to some extent can reuse nuclear waste
[03:46:22] <jan6> yeah
[03:46:53] <CalimeroTeknik> I'd like to note that black holes are speculation for which no evidence exists
[03:46:54] <jan6> it's just that "hey, it's cheaper to just not care"
[03:47:18] <jan6> well, it's pretty hard to get evidence for black holes
[03:48:00] <CalimeroTeknik> moreover, they are extrapolated from extending Schwarzschild's 1916 external solution to gravity *outside* massive stars in a way that makes no mathematical sense according to Souriau
[03:48:13] <CalimeroTeknik> or Grothendieck for that matter
[03:48:22] <jan6> and @power, there's stuff like thorium reactors
[03:48:45] <CalimeroTeknik> the S in "thorium" is for safety
[03:48:59] <jan6> same for uranium
[03:49:27] <CalimeroTeknik> I see you're catching on ^^
[03:49:36] <jan6> most powerful things require a lot of caution to use well and effectively
[03:49:54] <jan6> (most OF powerful things, I mean)
[03:50:21] <CalimeroTeknik> there is a minimum of danger that's inherent to energy
[03:50:38] <CalimeroTeknik> but it's possible to make it more dangerous with no return in terms of energy
[03:51:39] <CalimeroTeknik> why would you do that? some people find it exciting if it's dangerous
[03:52:08] <CalimeroTeknik> just look at these guys who died in the demon core accident, due to careless manipulation with a flimsy screwdriver to keep it from going critical
[03:52:31] <jan6> accidents will always happen
[03:52:46] <CalimeroTeknik> or "eventually"
[03:52:49] <jan6> the best you can do is highly reduce the chances of one happening and escalating
[03:52:53] <CalimeroTeknik> but to have them coming is not good news
[03:53:29] <jan6> better to have a few non-critical mistakes, than one massive one
[03:53:31] <CalimeroTeknik> I mean, a scientist is keeping stuff from going critical with a screwdriver while making a casual demo? what sort of sick joke is this
[03:54:00] <jan6> the kind a scientist would do
[03:54:25] <jan6> but it's also asking for trouble, lol
[03:55:26] <Joanna> One opinion that is never discussed is not wasting so much energy. Also have there ever been rocket stoves that use coal or gas instead of wood ?
[03:55:32] <Joanna> CalimeroTeknik:
[03:56:38] <CalimeroTeknik> yes, there are
[03:56:45] <jan6> there's a lot of ways to be more efficient
[03:56:52] <jan6> but where's the profit in that?
[03:57:28] <CalimeroTeknik> there are people working on making the economical concepts to convince the finance world to encourage rather than discourage it
[03:57:29] <jan6> did you see the video about how the oil and plastic companies tricked people about recycling, and still do?
[03:57:30] <Joanna> It’s kind of ridiculous that most  stoves are still designed so inefficiently
[03:57:42] <CalimeroTeknik> sells more fuel™
[03:57:54] <Joanna> Yea that’s the problem
[03:58:21] <jan6> also depends what you define as "inefficient", if it's heating up your room, it could be a feature ;P
[03:58:28] <Joanna> I’ve seen self flushing toilets and automatic sinks
[03:58:50] <jan6> automatic sinks are something most people immediately see the value of
[03:58:59] <Joanna> The self flushing toilets flush themselves 5 times in a row when not needed
[03:59:12] <jan6> although the alternative would simply be foot-activated sinks
[03:59:12] <Joanna> Wasting water as well as energy.
[03:59:54] <jan6> I've never seen a self-flushing toilet
[04:00:07] <jan6> that seems pretty nonsense idea
[04:00:35] <Joanna> To be honest I’m looking forward to the end of excessive energy wastage. No more being blinded by streetlights at night or choking on auto exhaust.
[04:02:33] <Joanna> What would really be more efficient for cooking is things being made locally in large batches. A separate stove in every home has always been inefficient
[04:05:58] <jan6> streetlights make sense, but basically NOBODY's bothered to consider the effects of switching to LED lights, or such
[04:06:10] <jan6> like the sodium lights are just fine all night
[04:06:52] <jan6> I have some hanging in the middle of the street RIGHT next to our windows, and it's perfectly alright

[05:27:48] <CalimeroTeknik> leds are catching on around here
[05:28:09] <CalimeroTeknik> with a problem: since they're less expensive in all aspects, they install more
[05:28:50] <CalimeroTeknik> not only do I dislike the hot temperature of the light that makes it seem like permanent dusk, they also disturb the sleep of insects, which is an environmental issue
[05:32:19] <Joanna> CalimeroTeknik: leds are horrible lights I’d rather stumble around in the dark
[05:33:05] <Joanna> I like those sodium lights that give an orangish glow
[05:47:36] <Joanna> Maybe the led lights would be less unpleasant if they had orange plastic and a good diffuser but most seem to want to use them for surveillance so they use white ones.

[05:59:45] <Joanna> The main intention of street lights seems to be the idea that crime can’t happen with lights on so they make bright lights rather than preventing crime. Same logic as solving homelessness by putting dividers on park benches..
[06:07:48] * jessicara finds it very interesting rt is banned for propaganda but for absolutely everything else need an opposing voice for balance
[06:08:09] <jessicara> at this point why not just ban all the left media in the uk lol
[06:08:16] <jessicara> it's "propaganda" or such

[06:09:19] * jessicara would even argue this token representation of the opposition is even more harmful than outright banning
[06:12:43] <Joanna> jessicara: maybe rt is annoying them with documentaries about misdeeds of other governments:)
[06:14:21] <Joanna> Also when you see things which claim to be fair and balanced it’s just a trick. Both “sides” are working together to steer the narrative towards either distraction or worse.
[06:15:30] <Joanna> I admit I was once tricked by left media for a short time.
[06:16:54] <Joanna> Then I noticed they didn’t care about human rights abuses outside their pet topics of gays minorities and Palestinians...

[06:23:43] <Joanna> Sometimes people pretend to be working for the exact opposite of what they are doing . In 2019 there was suddenly a lot of drama and demonstrations about vaccines. And then “the antivaxxers caused a measles outbreak at Disney land” then we must stop the antivaxxers lets make some new laws to get rid religious waivers !! They started persecuting Orthodox Jews about measles and closing their schools. All the people who had been 
[06:23:43] <Joanna> quietly opting out of vaccines were not at all helped at all by the fake people who were paid to make drama and had to either home school or move or bribe doctors for medical waivers. Then the zealots started going after the doctors and then voila Covid!!
[06:52:04] <jessicara> seems like left and right is a distraction, they code switch and play both sides keeping people too busy fighting each other while paying their friends taxpayer money it seems
[06:53:10] <jessicara> occasionally get one who isn't very authoritarian and it's kinda nice for a while
[06:54:54] <Roey> <Joanna> Also when you see things which claim to be fair and balanced it’s just a trick. Both “sides” are working together to steer the narrative towards either distraction or worse. <- bingo
[06:55:21] <Roey> <jessicara> seems like left and right is a distraction, they code switch and play both sides keeping people too busy fighting each other while paying their friends taxpayer money it seems <- yep.
[06:55:53] <Roey> at least in America, the established Republicans and Democrats constitute a "uniparty"./
[06:56:20] <jessicara> more thinking about the one party, the uk conservatives never seem to really get rid of
