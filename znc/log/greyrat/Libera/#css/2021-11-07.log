[14:27:46] <braindead_> hey all
[14:27:51] <braindead_> i am having a problem with flex direction https://jsfiddle.net/pL23y49c/
[14:28:03] <braindead_> I want to use 'flex-direction: column' on the parent and on the child use 'row'.
[14:28:15] <braindead_> Is this possible or anybody can help me pointing to a work around to achieve it?
[14:34:11] <pavonia> You are already doing that. What's the issue exactly?
[14:34:48] <braindead_> its not working
[14:35:16] <braindead_> as you can see in the fiddle. the result i want to achieve is shown below
[14:35:56] <braindead_> service 1, 2 and 3 should be placed next to each other. but instead they are still below in column orientation
[14:36:00] <pavonia> Oh
[14:36:27] <pavonia> Well, you can't change the direction within the same flex
[14:37:56] <pavonia> Are you sure you don't want another <ul> layer for service 1-3?
[14:38:51] <braindead_> that would be sweet and if there is really not other solution, i could maybe go that way but hopefully there is a solution for this
[14:39:13] <braindead_> it would also be possible to get rid of the flex on mobile-toggle-nav-ul
[14:39:29] <braindead_> since its not really doing much i figured
[14:39:56] <pavonia> With the current HTMl you could use flex-wrap and make the nav-services elements short than the other elements
[14:41:46] <pavonia> What is "Services" as opposed to "Service 1-3"? It very much looks kind of like a heading with 3 entries
[14:42:48] <braindead_> thats correct but services itself is a page too
[14:43:26] <braindead_> the actual navigation looks a bit more fancy than the fiddle of course and I think it makes sense there
[14:45:00] <braindead_> i think my main issue is, that i cant get .nav-services in a row
[14:45:09] <braindead_> even if I remove the parent flex its not doing it
[14:45:28] <pavonia> IMHO, the document structure should be changed, but as said, you could use flex-wrap with proper element widths
[14:46:00] <pavonia> The out flex doesn't really do anything here
[14:46:04] <pavonia> *outer
[14:46:35] <braindead_> agree on the outer flex. are you able to get .nav-services as row?
[14:47:27] <pavonia> Yes
[14:47:53] <braindead_> can you show it to me please?
[14:48:49] <braindead_> if you save you can share the link (in case you dont know)
[14:55:57] <pavonia> Simply set display: inline-block; on the .nav-services elements and remove all the flex stuff
[14:56:48] <braindead_> you are right https://jsfiddle.net/pL23y49c/1/
[14:57:00] <braindead_> i think i was too focused on flex
[14:57:09] <braindead_> still curious why flex isnt working there
[14:59:23] <pavonia> flexbox is a one-direction layout. You are trying to change the direction in the middle and then back, which flex isn't really made for
[15:00:10] <braindead_> but even just for .nav-services its not working
[15:00:51] <pavonia> It is working, but there is only a single element to layout, so the result is just the same as without
[15:02:00] <braindead_> still thinking about that. arent there three elements?
[15:02:31] <pavonia> There are three flex layouts with a single element each
[15:03:18] <braindead_> perfect. thank you. totally correct
[15:05:41] <braindead_> thats why text-align: inline-flex; exists. i see.
[15:06:50] <braindead_> i mean: display: inline-flex
[15:14:49] <braindead_> on another note, is libera basically the new freenode?

[16:21:11] <theskillwithin> AmR is a <p> element inline or block?

[16:22:16] <stenno\OK> thats a css question, not a html question though
[16:23:03] <stenno\OK> a p is inline just like almost any other element before the UA stylesheet is applied
[16:23:44] <stenno\OK> 'inline' and 'block' are css concepts, they are irrelevant for html itself
[16:26:59] <stenno\OK> so the answer to the question if <p> is inline or block technically is 'depends on UA stylesheet'
[16:27:07] <stenno\OK> specs _recommend_ block
[16:27:45] <stenno\OK> you can confirm this by applying `display: initial` to a <p>

[16:30:15] <stenno\OK> yes, i do think that
[16:30:30] <stenno\OK> i would not have said it otherwise
[16:30:40] <theskillwithin> wow ok
[16:31:33] <theskillwithin> you must have a super low opinion of me then
[16:31:40] <theskillwithin> cuz thats basics
[16:35:17] <lechner> Hi, do   float: left;   elements inherit margin & padding from body, please?
[16:39:25] <lechner> or should they?
[16:39:38] <stenno\OK> no
[16:39:56] <stenno\OK> float: left; is still in the normal document flow
[16:40:23] <lechner> they do not inherit, right?
[16:40:36] <stenno\OK> they do not
[16:40:53] <stenno\OK> nothing inherits margin and padding afaik
[16:41:03] <stenno\OK> lechner: https://jsfiddle.net/mw6s25rp/
[16:44:03] <lechner> you are right!
[16:45:08] <lechner> the why would the spacing change when i add     float: left; clear: left;   to several elements?
[16:45:11] <lechner> than
[16:45:14] <lechner> then

[21:16:05] <afidegnum> hi, i'm trying to render a page with with bootstrap but an additional css is also added which was to be generated from the server for Server Side Rendering, despite my plea to remove it from the framework, i'm told the custom class is important. but this ends up braking my page. how do i make __perseus_content being part of the bootstrap class? https://pasteboard.co/SWpPoXabHjtM.png
[21:19:15] <hassoon> afidegnum: what do you exactly want to do with that element that you selected in the devtools ?
[21:19:46] *** Joins: imp (~imp@189-94-80-115.3g.claro.net.br)
[21:20:57] <afidegnum> the issue is, that element is interfering with the original structure i guess. and being root node, I want the inner bootstrap element to appear, which should overide that class,
[21:21:22] <afidegnum> that class does not have any rule
[21:21:53] <hassoon> do you want to add a specific class to that one element ?
[21:22:36] <afidegnum> if any rule can apply so bootstrap properties can be rendered, i will be grateful
