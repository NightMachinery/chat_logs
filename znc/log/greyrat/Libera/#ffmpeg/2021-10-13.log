[00:00:35] <twiclo> How do I get a filtergraph?
[00:05:00] <durandal_1707> if you do not know what is filtegraph, than you probably do not use it
[00:05:08] <durandal_1707> post full command line you use instead
[00:05:14] <durandal_1707> *pastebin it
[00:05:59] <twiclo> ffmpeg -i Lost.S02E13.mkv -map 0:v -map 0:a:m:language:eng -map 0:s:m:language:eng -c copy output.mkv
[00:07:14] <durandal_1707> well, i guess you will need to use setts bitstream filter
[00:08:19] <twiclo> What does that do?
[00:10:12] <durandal_1707> just changes PTS & DTS in video
[00:10:58] <twiclo> DTS is a sound thing isn't it? What does that have to do with timestamps?
[00:11:16] <durandal_1707> DTS is not display time stamp
[00:11:28] <durandal_1707> s/not//
[00:11:37] <durandal_1707> PTS is presentation timestamp
[00:11:54] <durandal_1707> DTS is actually demuxer timestamp or something like that
[00:12:06] <kepstin> i always though DTS was decode time stamp
[00:12:06] <durandal_1707> decoded i guess
[00:12:20] <durandal_1707> yes, brain farts, sorry
[00:12:45] <twiclo> So what are we changing about these things?
[00:12:53] <durandal_1707> only PTS and DTS
[00:12:59] <durandal_1707> audio and video remain same
[00:14:07] <twiclo> Right so what are we changing with PTS and DTS?

[01:00:09] <Vall> hyrcanus: doesnt that f*ck up the quality?
[01:01:57] <hyrcanus> mhm, rehash of an old compression joke
[01:02:28] <hyrcanus> a lot of people imagine 'two pass = better' without understanding
[01:02:33] <Vall> ah, so you are kidding ;-)
[01:02:36] <Vall> heh
[01:03:43] <Vall> Back in the day (late 80s), before ZIP, there was a compression program called ARC which actually benefitted from being run twice.
[01:03:49] <Vall> But it was a piece of crap
[01:04:13] <hyrcanus> x264 and x265 benefit from two-pass when you are trying to 1) hit a specific filesize (e.g fill a CD-ROM fully) or 2) generate optimal stream for a bandwidth target
[01:04:35] <Vall> hyrcanus: my case is #2 (generate optimal stream for a bandwidth target)
[01:04:36] <BtbN> they also don't re-encode twice in two pass mode
[01:04:47] <BtbN> they literally just do the same encode twice, recording knowledge during the first pass
[01:04:57] <hyrcanus> ^
[01:05:23] <Vall> BtbN: yep, pass 1 prepare a log file and pass 2 uses it to 'distribute' bandwidth optimally
[01:05:54] <Vall> But if hvec_nvenc doesn't support it, I don't want it ;-)
[01:06:08] <Vall> I'm now a nvenc convert, thanks to BtbN ;-)
[01:06:18] <AMM> When I was new into pretty much everything I did at first think 2pass was better, because words about it said it was as the encoder then had hints of the complicated parts etc
[01:06:32] <BtbN> You can kinda emulate it, by just trial-and-erroring a cq value
[01:06:34] <AMM> omitting the part about basic lookahead
[01:06:42] <BtbN> that's rather similar than what x264/5 are doing even
[01:07:07] *** Quits: odrling (~odrling@korone.aidoru.agency) (Quit: see you space cowboy)
[01:07:20] <Vall> yeah, but real 2-pass should reach a more optimal bandwidth distribution than lookahead
[01:07:34] <Vall> (or at least I think so, from the depth of my ignorance)
[01:07:50] <AMM> Yes, if you have to consider a strict bandwidth limit
[01:08:08] *** Joins: odrling (~odrling@korone.aidoru.agency)
[01:08:21] <BtbN> not so much bandwidth limit
[01:08:25] <BtbN> but file size limit
[01:08:30] <BtbN> the momentary bandwidth can be quite high
[01:08:57] <Vall> BtbN: isn't file size and bandwidth strictly correlated for the same file?
[01:09:11] <Vall> I mean, double the bandwidth, double the file size etc?
[01:09:12] <BtbN> only if you only consider the whole file
[01:09:35] <Vall> Which is what 'real' 2-pass does, no?
[01:09:43] <BtbN> The file can be 50kbps for 90% of playtime, but still end up at 8mbps average total bitrate with a sufficiently huge spike
[01:10:06] <BtbN> and that's all two-pass does, ensure average bitrate for that specific file
[01:10:32] <BtbN> so if it decides that 5 seconds of an hour long video needs most of the bitrate, that's where it'll go
[01:10:46] <BtbN> granted, that's a stupidly extreme example, just to illustrate the behaviour
[01:10:56] <Vall> yep, I dig it
[01:11:15] <Vall> Man, hvec_nvenc 'slow'
[01:11:33] <BtbN> I think for 1080p at fastest settings it does 2000 fps or something
[01:11:41] <BtbN> If you can deliver it frames fast enough
[01:11:56] <Vall> er, hvec_nvenc 'slow' preset is so fast it's saturating my output device (a 4-disk raidz2 ZFS composed -- unfortunatelly - of SMR disks)
[01:12:25] <Vall> I think I will buy better disks just to make hvec_nvenc happier ;-)
[01:12:55] <BtbN> -f null - to see how fast it goes
[01:14:20] <Vall> here, '-f null' aborts with something like being unable to determine the output format without an extension
[01:14:46] <BtbN> huh. null is the output format in that case
[01:14:48] <Vall> and 'null.mp4' actually generates a file called 'null.mp4' in the current dir ;-)
[01:14:49] <BtbN> the - is important
[01:15:02] <Vall> ah, the - *after* the null
[01:15:08] <Vall> I really overlooked that
[01:15:15] <BtbN> the - is the output
[01:15:20] <Vall> OK
[01:15:31] <Vall> Will try that here

[01:20:23] <gonewest818[m]> is there a way to get ffprobe (or some other tool like it) to print the details of the edit list atoms in a quicktime mov?
[01:31:14] <Vall> Does `-threads 2` actually mean 2 CPU threads running in parallel? Or something else?
[01:37:55] <BtbN> yes
[01:38:31] <BtbN> By default it will use all threads it can get. Which for one makes no sense for hwaccel, and actually causes issue cause it buffers one frame per "thread", resulting in the decoder running out of framebuffers
[01:38:52] <Vall> ah, it makes sense now.
[01:39:37] <Vall> Anyway, I see ffmpeg using less than 18% (of a single CPU here) so it's probably being limited by my SMR disks etc
[01:46:40] <BtbN> With hwenc, the most likely limit is either the hwencoder itself, or your ability to get data to and from it fast enough
[01:46:47] <BtbN> pretty much never the CPU

[14:31:09] <SimAV> Had by chance anyone in here a closer look at decklink_input_callback::VideoInputFrameArrived in libavdevice/decklink_dec.cpp?
[14:33:17] <SimAV> I'm capturing with a DeckLink Duo 2 in half-duplex mode an SDI Signal (1080i50) from an Atomos Shogun 7 in its switcher mode and experiencing audio/video sync issues after some time.
[14:34:16] <SimAV> In the "Desktop Video Developer Support FAQs" on https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/developer/product/capture-and-playback there is an entry titled "Audio / Video stream time offset when capturing with DeckLink Duo 2 / Quad 2 in Half Duplex" which obviously seems very related
[14:34:52] <SimAV> there, BMD recommends "applications should restart the streams at the no signal -> signal transition point, which will ensure synchronisation between the stream times"
[14:35:19] <SimAV> As far as I can see, ffmpeg doesn't follow these recommendations yet?

[14:41:39] <hyrcanus> maybe you've found something to improve, that the developer should know about
[14:42:04] <hyrcanus> the chances that he is reading this right now are quite slim
[14:45:10] *** Quits: af (~af@awalgarg.me) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[14:45:23] <SimAV> I tinkered a little bit with the code and tried to simply put a variant of BMD's example code at the corresponding place.
[14:45:34] <SimAV> To me it seems as if it indeed improves the situation
[14:46:07] *** Joins: af (~af@awalgarg.me)
[14:46:35] <SimAV> however, I do not have a signal generator which can reliably create flaky SDI signals
[14:47:35] <SimAV> I can only wobble a barely inserted cable.
[14:48:33] <SimAV> But this suffices to make audio and video PTS drift during the "lost connection" state
[14:49:20] <hyrcanus> perhaps you could email the maintainer of that code and cc: the manufacturer of the device
[14:49:23] <SimAV> (or at the point where signal is lost or returning, with just wobbling a cable I can't diagnose this more fine grained)

[15:39:30] <bencoh> well, we're talking about SDI, right? ...
[15:39:33] <SimAV> BtbN, yes, when SDI was defined, a simple A/D conversion strategy was chosen (simply sample the analog signal with constant rate) which brought the horizontal and vertical blanking interval in the digital era.
[15:39:37] *** Joins: af (~af@awalgarg.me)
[15:39:59] <bencoh> you even need to parse "ancillary data" there ...

[15:40:15] <SimAV> in the horizontal blanking interval audio is stored. in the vertical blanking interval stuff like closed captions are transferred

[15:51:20] <BtbN> Does it transmit timestamps at all? I'd assume so, given you can synchronize various separate sources?
[15:54:49] <bencoh> tbh I haven't played with SDI for ~6 years, but the decklink API allows retrieving a frame timestamp/duration
[15:55:46] <bencoh> I don't remember how that is transmitted (if at all), or whether it's separate for a/v
[15:55:48] <SimAV> bencoh, but if that timestamp was embedded in the frame, it should neither restart at zero if one follows BMD's recommendation nor drift just because signal was lost
[15:56:18] <SimAV> so from that perspective i doubt that the decklink card evaluates metadata for returning the timestamps at all
[15:57:04] <bencoh> but considering how it was designed, I wouldn't be surprised if there were no timestamp for video (assuming a fixed framerate)
[15:57:05] <SimAV> (whether metadata is in principle present, is another question. But I wouldn't make conclusions from what the decklink API offers)
[15:57:31] <SimAV> yes, that's what I assume too
[15:57:43] <bencoh> and having ancillary-based timestamp for audio wouldn't surprise me either
[15:57:47] <bencoh> but I honestly don't know
[16:06:55] <SimAV> hmm, OK...
[16:08:31] <SimAV> anyway, if as in my case the SDI source continuously transmits, and only the cable is disconnected/reconnected, it is definitely wrong to have different audio and video PTS if they were identical before
[16:08:51] <SimAV> *after connection is reestablished
[16:10:23] <SimAV> Hmm, I need a 1.5G SDI capable BNC-T-adapter... Would be interesting whether one and the same signal applied to two inputs will end up with different PTS on both inputs if one of them is disconnected for some time...

[18:18:14] <kepstin> it most likely means that there will be some visual corruption on the frame, which may persist into following frames due to prediction
[18:18:25] <kepstin> the effects might not be visible tho
[18:19:02] <JEEB> notarealtest: what sort of input is this?
[18:19:21] <JEEB> if it's MPEG-TS there's a flag that's for some reason not enabled by default
[18:19:36] <JEEB> which makes libavformat not actually output packets noted as corrupt
[18:19:56] <notarealtest> MPEG-4
[18:20:37] <JEEB> which part of MPEG-4? you have the container (part 12), you have what used to be used by xvid|divx (part 2), what is often known as H.264... (part 10)
[18:21:00] <JEEB> I was speaking of input/container
[18:22:50] <notarealtest> i don't understand, unfortunately
[18:23:50] <another|> is it a .mp4?
[18:24:01] <notarealtest> oh yeah it's mp4
[18:24:25] <another|> then it's most likely MPEG-4 Part 12
[18:25:01] <JEEB> ok, then it sounds like you've gotten that file corrupted
[18:25:15] <notarealtest> the output file, or the input file?
[18:25:28] <JEEB> since mp4 stuff doesn't sound like you'd start or stop a packet mid-ways
[18:25:46] <JEEB> while in mpeg-ts if you stop receiving a TV channel or something, your last packet will be partial
[18:26:06] <JEEB> and you get a broken last packet (unsurprisingly)
[18:27:04] <notarealtest> would it matter if i just start the process over again, or is the problem from the source material?

[19:29:10] <durandal_1707> i do not think so
[19:29:26] <durandal_1707> it happens with A/V pts diverge from each other
[19:30:42] <kepstin> since if it is all activate based, the concat filter should be requesting frames from v1 and a1 in both cases, and those are both the trims with matching pts in the trim and atrim.
[19:31:01] *** Quits: AbleBacon_ (~AbleBacon@user/AbleBacon) (Client Quit)
[19:31:09] <kepstin> and keep going on those until the trim filters report eof, at which point it switches to v2 and a2, right?

[19:31:59] <kepstin> that said, I personally try to avoid doing multiple trims with the same source file. especially if there are big gaps, separate inputs with seek can be better
[19:33:27] <redro> Better in what sense?
[19:34:24] <kepstin> faster, at least
[19:35:08] <kepstin> (multiple inputs will be slower with small gaps since there's overhead to initializing each input)
[19:37:05] <redro> I haven't found speed problems doing it this way though I rarely need more than 10 segments.

[21:14:11] <Calint> hello, I am reading a mkv file with FFMPEG and streaming to peertube, How do I make ffmpeg include the subtitles in the stream?

[21:28:18] <klaxa> from what i can tell peertube uses rtmp so tough luck
[21:28:40] <murb> people still use rtmp?!
[21:29:07] <JEEB> people have invested in it with existing solutions, so hard to get them out of it without another completely full solution
[21:30:21] <murb> ha well i spent lots of energy getting a working HLS configuration, top tip ffmpeg only does mpegts'ed mp3 in hls mode if you want raw mp3 you have to use the other segmenter which isn't quite HLS compliant.

[22:23:18] <furq> rtmp doesn't support subtitles
[22:23:28] <furq> you'd have to burn them in
