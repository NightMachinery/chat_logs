[01:03:36] <Patsie> thanks
[01:04:28] <blei> looks like you've got a mock graphics card; but can it do deep learning?
[01:05:14] <Patsie> to tell you the truth, I was already looking into doing some AI in awk, but it's a _lot_ of math
[01:05:39] <blei> i might start with curve fitting using high degree polynomials
[01:05:53] <Earnestly> probability, something pure mathematicians hate ;o
[01:06:01] <blei> you can call it AI if you back off the degree of the polynomial to obtain better generalization (less overfitting)
[01:07:05] <Patsie> I'm just waiting for proper support of sixels to make even better graphics in my awk scripts :D

[01:42:09] <geirha> or you you can hide the loop in a function
[01:42:19] <geirha> !inarray
[01:42:19] <greybot> Check whether a value is in an array: inarray() { local n=$1 h; shift; for h; do [[ $n = "$h" ]] && return; done; return 1; } # Usage: inarray "$value" "${array[@]}" Or just use an associative array if possible

[03:23:10] <reticuli> I find that sometimes while writing a long command, I hit C-c because I have to run something else before but then realize it never made it to my history so need to scroll back which is a bit annoying

[03:51:37] <Xanthaos> So by using || exit 1 it will stop on an exitcode of 1, or an exitcode of anything non-zero?
[03:51:43] <larryv> the latter
[03:52:26] <wiscii> '||' is an OR and '&&' is an AND and both are reactive to the exit status fed to them
[03:52:30] <Xanthaos> Okay, so omitting the 1 would cause it to exit on any exitcode
[03:52:41] <Xanthaos> Okay
[03:52:42] <larryv> no
[03:52:51] <wiscii> exit 1 means exit WITH error
[03:52:56] <wiscii> generally
[03:53:05] <larryv> ''exit'' by itself propagates the last exit status

[03:56:31] <pj> when you do `|| exit` it will exit with a non-zero code, because if the cmd returned 0 it would not be triggering the exit at all.
[03:56:57] <pj> The difference is that the code itself will be more relevant to the error that triggered the exit in the first place.
[03:57:55] <wiscii> Xanthaos: you could always use 'if command'; then foo; else bar; fi; pooh
[03:57:55] <Xanthaos> That might be more useful then, so I can use the error code as part of the diagnostic.

[12:47:06] <emanuele6> 4000<enter> behaves the same..
[12:47:18] <rendar> let's say i want to run some shell built-ins, like 'type' from some other language, say python.. is correct then to launch `bash -c 'type ..'` from python?
[12:47:36] <rendar> (and check the exit code?)
[12:47:54] <emanuele6> use python to check it.

[12:48:53] <shbot> emanuele6: 1
[12:48:53] <pj> rendar: if you want to use a shell builtin from another language then you have to launch bash, yes, but be aware that the system call from said other language might already be running the command through bash for you.
[12:48:56] <geirha> sh -c 'type "$@"' _ cmd
[12:49:01] <emanuele6> bash will return the exit code of the last command

[12:49:25] <shbot> emanuele6: 1
[12:49:28] <rendar> pj, yeah indeed
[12:49:47] <rendar> emanuele6, yes
[12:50:01] <rendar> emanuele6, if i use only 'type' i will get the exit code of type

[12:50:46] <emanuele6> you should `type -P' to check the presence of a program in PATH
[12:50:49] <geirha> so it'll likely make more sense to do the test with python instead

[16:11:09] <cousteau> I'm a bit confused about bash's and ssh's documentation mentioning a "command".  For example, bash's doc says that ``eval`` concatenates its arguments and runs them "as a single command", which is kind of misleading, since ``eval "echo" "hello; echo world"`` is clearly two commands
[16:11:35] <cousteau> Unless "command" refers to "shell script/code".
[16:12:15] <cousteau> ssh does the same in its docs.  At least it's consistent.

[16:13:34] <phogg> in your example you are running two commands: eval once, echo once. Within the eval both arguments are used together to form a single command.
[16:14:08] <phogg> so "eval 'echo hello'" and "eval echo hello'" are equivalent

[16:14:46] <phogg> ah, I was reading your quoting wrong...
[16:15:00] <cousteau> phogg: it seems to be using ``echo`` twice though
[16:15:12] <phogg> it is using echo twice, yes
[16:15:29] <ormaaj> It refers to the shell grammar. Everything is basically a command. It's the highest level construct. A `list` is multiple commands separated by ; && ||.
[16:15:41] <cousteau> # echo "hello; echo world"
[16:15:41] <shbot> cousteau: hello; echo world
[16:15:48] <cousteau> # eval echo "hello; echo world"
[16:15:49] <shbot> cousteau: hello
[16:15:49] <shbot> cousteau: world
[16:16:22] <phogg> it seems to me like it's just trying to describe the fact that 'eval echo hello' runs one command, not saying that you can't pass a list of commands
[16:16:22] <mannequin> # eval echo "wold: hi"

[16:18:58] <ormaaj> The arguments are nothing. They're strings. Until the eval command runs and the shell parses them that is.
[16:19:12] <cousteau> So it can be passed to constructs that accept a single command
[16:19:33] <cousteau> Unlike do...done, for example
[16:19:43] <osse> Would be better if it said "The  args  are  read  and  concatenated together into a single string"

[16:23:46] <cousteau> ormaaj: so my point is, did you mean that they meant "concatenated together into a single command" might mean that "eval is a simple command"?
[16:25:02] <ormaaj> Nope that's not what they meant.

[16:27:43] <cousteau> s/command/script/ would be better IMO
[16:28:01] <phogg> as Soliton said 'help read' describes it better. The POSIX docs unfortunately also describe the result as a 'command' (singular).
[16:28:49] <cousteau> Yeah, I see that 'help eval' does use "commandS" in plural, which is less misleading
[16:29:17] <cousteau> (and suggests that it's actually a script, i.e., substitution and friends will happen)
[16:29:47] <ormaaj> "script" is ambiguous. It meant to say the eval is a single command. Just like calling a function is one command. The code that eval executes occurs in within the command's "environment" / context.

[18:11:58] <Soliton> SHELL is the login shell of the current user.

[18:20:12] <cassepipe> If both variables exist
[18:20:18] <Soliton> for zsh check something that is set only in zsh. not some random env variable.
[18:20:20] <jelly> I don't think this is worth fixing.  Now that you know the code checks SHELL, you can set it in advance next time you want to bash

[22:50:18] <Linux_Dr_guest> Can anyone recommend a good crash course tutorial covering advanced file/handle redirection in bash. While I started doing file redirection with csh, and before that DOS, I've been using it in bash for well over 20 years, and the syntax eludes me. I tried reading section 3.6 from the bash manual, and I feel like I'm slogging through soup.

[22:59:15] <Linux_Dr_guest> I only only discovered in the last couple years that bash can bundle up a redirected file handle into a string passable as a command line argument, openable as a file within an external application. I'm guessing POSIX needs to provide some support to intercept that name interpertation?
[22:59:32] <tirnanog> for instance, 2>&1 is simply an instruction to dup(licate) file descriptor 1 to 2. dup2(1,2).
[22:59:34] <geirha> > file  and  < file   ends up calling open(2) and dup2(2), while   2>&1  only does a dup2(2)

[23:05:55] <Linux_Dr_guest> how much of this black magic is available in stock POSIX Bourne shell?
[23:06:09] <twkm> none.
[23:06:38] <twkm> as an aside, posix sh isn't the same as bourne.
[23:07:46] <Linux_Dr_guest> Posix sh != bourne? I was unaware of that.
[23:08:27] <Linux_Dr_guest> twkm, let me rephrase that... some file redirection (like `ls > filename` is part of Bourne).... other stuff, (like "process substitution") is not... where is the line between what is and isn't supported?
[23:08:44] <geirha> !posix
[23:08:44] <greybot> The POSIX standard defines what any modern unix should support. Use just POSIX external commands and options to make portable scripts. See http://shellhaters.org
[23:08:50] <tirnanog> most importantly, it's part of posix. bourne is a museum piece at this point so it's not all that interesting to speak of its features in isolation.
[23:09:04] <tirnanog> other than in a historical context, of course.
[23:10:45] <geirha> here's specifically the page detailing what language features an sh implementation should support in order to be posix compliant: https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18
[23:10:45] <Linux_Dr_guest> I don't know about "Bourne" per se, but a particular version of POSIX is helpful for writing something to run on any *nix machine released/updated as of a particular date.... right?

[23:16:16] <tirnanog> as far as the 'ordinary' redirection syntax is concerned, the ability to choose and assign file decriptor numbers to variables is bash-specific. for instance, this wouldn't work in sh: exec {fd}<filename && echo "fd number is $fd".
