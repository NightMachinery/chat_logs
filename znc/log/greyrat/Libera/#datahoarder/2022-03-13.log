[18:34:20] <ThePendulum> "Chiliâ€™s baby back ribs are not entirely made of pork. Chiliâ€™s ribs are actually a mixture of beef and pork (70 percent beef, 30 percent pork)."
[18:34:23] <ThePendulum> huh, how does that work
[18:34:50] <ThePendulum> I thought they were slabs of meat straight from a pig, they're processed?
[18:37:48] <skye0> likely. maybe to maximize just what's in it instead of trying to deliver on quality, how american food kind of tends to work
[18:38:03] <skye0> for some reason they really love beef while europe and non-Muslim Asia really loves pork
[18:41:42] <ThePendulum> how do you add the beef to solid meat though
[18:42:42] <ThePendulum> I never really cared for beef, but maybe I never had it done properly

[20:40:38] <vuori> btrfs raid1 works ok, including at least one drive breakage for me
[20:41:13] <vuori> I have since mostly moved to ssd+backups for boot and changing data drives and snapraid for archives
[20:43:11] <rawktucc> i use snapraid at home but ive hit a brick wall where there's clearly free space, but snapraid won't use it for parity
[20:43:26] <rawktucc> so since im moving to a remote server for a while, i'll use zfs for archives, and btrfs for the root fs
[20:43:51] <rawktucc> i dont expect the nvme ssds to break tbh, given they're enterprise, but better to be prepared
[20:44:12] <vuori> strange, haven't seen that yet myself. generally I've come to the conclusion that it's better to have great backups and less raid rather than great raid and less backups, unless the volume really needs to be online all the time

[20:45:06] <rawktucc> it doesn't reallly need to be online all the time, but it's more about data integrity
[20:45:27] <rawktucc> also, it's cheaper to rent a large server and just have the data be hot, than let it sit in cold s3 storage
[20:45:42] <rawktucc> plus having it has hot online means it's easy to access something on a whim
