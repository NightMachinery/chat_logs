[00:05:00] <whatsupdoc> What is the purpose of interfaces if you still have to implement the method in each class that inherits that interface seperately? Is it just so there is a contract that explicitely tells you what methods you should expect and it adds uniformity to the design of your program?

[00:06:00] <juliaEnv> whatsupboy the purpose of interfaces is to depend on an interface, not on a specific implementation. An interface is a contract. (see design by contract)
[00:06:26] <whatsupdoc> Ok I think I'm right then. Thanks

[00:07:29] <juliaEnv> if you want to inherit an implementation, consider an abstract class instead. In some langauges, like Java, an interface may implement some parts as well.
[00:07:35] <LiaoTao> whatsupdoc, It's also about isolation of concern and extensibility
[00:07:57] <LiaoTao> I.e. the important bit is that the part of the program that uses the interface only knows about the interface

You can't "fix" a problem with a decorator pattern, but you can use it as terminology to efficiently describe how you designed your code to other programmers without being technical.
[01:45:20] <Quietwalker> so it's good to have awareness of what the common ones encapsulate so you can speak and understand other devs without having to go into specifics of your code or line by line analysis.

[02:14:56] <mawk> light is damaging when it's high frequency

[02:40:35] * ^-^hi is zgorbluxic
[02:40:38] <Guest6835> mawk: are the frecuencies the same? and the intensity? are there secondary consecuencies?
[02:40:44] <[itchyjunk]> so you actually have used it? i saw py libraries for those and such
[02:40:51] <mawk> consecuencies is not a word Guest6835 
[02:40:59] <mawk> so now you're saying natural is about frequency and intensity? is that all?
[02:41:08] <mawk> what frequency is natural?
[02:41:08] <[itchyjunk]> PlanckWalk, in actual q computers, is there a way for them to 100% test that entanglement has happened?
[02:41:20] <[itchyjunk]> i distrust if qcomputers are even real or not
[02:41:22] <PlanckWalk> Nothing in quantum computers is 100%
[02:41:26] <Guest6835> mawk: answer, dont ask
[02:41:30] <PlanckWalk> But any lesser probability you like, sure.
[02:41:36] <PlanckWalk> Like 99.99999%

[03:26:34] <arahael> Good luck, and hopefully that 75% drops down to something like 74% once you've studied a few of the patterns, and contrasted the implementation of those patterns, perhaps, in C++ and Python.

[03:51:22] <Guest6835> whatsupdoc: is it not just a(n) (evil?) fashion?
[03:51:29] <InPhase> Guest6835: Say you have a game loop, one step in that loop is UpdateObjects(), which might do UpdatePlayer(), UpdateEnemies(), and UpdateBullets().  Inside UpddateEnemies() it might loop over enemies and update different types in a different way, and so on.  This is not a linearized list of steps, it's a call tree, working its way down the layers of abstraction until it gets to the math.
[03:51:32] <Guest6835> or ephimeral?
[03:51:50] <Guest2748> InPhase: isn't that just an instance of "Conways Law"? Since computer science uses trees to communicate abstract ideas, most software reflects that. In lisp you could conceptualize it as a list 
[03:52:20] <Guest2748> maybe if CS valued lists over trees software architectures would look much different
[03:52:45] <InPhase> Guest6835: They in fact then might share function calls at the bottom for the math then, but applied on different data, or with slight differences in parameters.  The hierarchy though gives a nuanced control over the structure of the operations, and a clarity at each abstraction layer that you don't get from a list of steps.

[03:56:57] <InPhase> whatsupdoc: I wanted to concur with the critiques in the article puts linked.  That SOLID concept is flimsy and not worth following with any rigor.  The Open-Closed principle is anti-agile, and single-responsibility is anti-structure.  Responsibilities get grouped as you build up the structure of a program, and so there's no way to get a "single" responsibility when you're bringing many of them 
[03:56:58] <Guest2748> InPhase but in real world I think software is a DAG not a tree, which you can only really comprehend as trees operating in parallel with some "glue" layer to glue the different pieces together. So it's like a list of trees glued together 
[03:57:03] <InPhase> together to build up something complicated.
[03:57:08] <Guest2748> simulating a DAG
[03:57:39] <Guest2748> true DAG would be hard to comprehend
[03:58:43] <InPhase> Guest2748: No?  A DAG language would prohibit for loops.  :-P
[03:58:56] <whatsupdoc> InPhase: Sure, but I think single-responsibility means don't add too many functionality all in one module. Kinda like make seperate functions that carry out single tasks - you don't want to write functions that take like 10 parameters and do like 20 different things
[04:00:40] <Guest6835> modularize
[04:01:02] <InPhase> whatsupdoc: The way I like to think about that need is that functions should have semantically clean behavior that does what it says on the label.
[04:01:56] <InPhase> whatsupdoc: In the ideal world, your function names and class names are so clear and straightforward that the behavior of the whole program is obvious from just reading the function names and class names, and you don't even need any comments.
[04:02:12] <InPhase> whatsupdoc: One never quite achieves this ideal in anything large, but that should be the aspiration.

[04:17:14] <phogg> unstructured programming makes it easy to make mistakes that cause bugs, and easy to write unmaintainable code
[04:17:21] <InPhase> Inst: The C++ standard forbids calling main.  Implementations might allow it though, at which point you're coding to the implementation and not the language standard.

When you try to hammer a problem into a paradigm that does not fit its natural structure, you make code more complicated and harder to comprehend and maintain.

[05:20:56] <Inst> nope, tbh, i probably should get through the basics section before I actually bother with trying to develop a functional style
[05:21:11] <Inst> typing up code from the textbook or doing exercises just seems boring gruntwork
[05:21:23] <InPhase> Yeah, that's pretty important for recursion.
[05:21:26] <Inst> might as well spice it up by getting working code in a different paradigm from the textbook

[05:22:29] <Inst> i mean, i can, use an if statement so if it returns xyz I kill the function, but that sort of defeats the point, doesn't it?
[05:22:55] <InPhase> It doesn't really.  Defining a termination method is pretty essential to recursion design.
[05:23:09] *** Joins: Crescendo (~Crescendo@user/crescendo)
[05:23:29] <Inst> so, like, when i call the function, I nest it into an if, and if if = xyz, I do a return, right?
[05:23:45] <Inst> i was just hoping there was a more elegant way to do it
[05:24:12] <Inst> like append the kill statement into the callee instead of the caller

[05:37:51] <InPhase> Inst: In C++, writing that in a function recursive form is generally a bad idea, because C++ does not offer guarantees that tail call optimization will happen, although this is common when optimization is enabled.  But without that TCO, that function will crash for large n as input.  Doing it as a for loop will not crash.

[13:38:22] <arahael> amigojapan: Sounds like you've got a fairly decent setup. I'm using 16 GB myself, though I ssh to my headless desktop quite often (which has more memory, but it turns out that more than 8 GB in this case was excessive)
[13:38:44] <arahael> amigojapan: If you bump up to 8 GB, though, you'll find that your disk gets cached better, but unless you're using that memory, that's all you'll see.
[13:39:06] <arahael> (Which is a significant performance boost, mind you)
[13:40:44] <arahael> If you're doing Android dev work, though, definitely update to 8GB.
[13:40:46] <amigojapan> arahael: yeah, the upgrade to 8BG on my laptop is only 30USD, and also I may buy it the battery it needs.
[13:41:09] <arahael> amigojapan: Yeah.  You've probably got the right idea to be fairly objective in what you're getting.
[13:41:10] <amigojapan> 37USD*

[13:43:45] <amigojapan> arahael: the computer only cost me 100USD about 6 yeras ago

[13:45:04] <arahael> amigojapan: If I wasn't having to constantly keep my knowledge up-to-date with iOS and android and "modern enterprise" crap, I'd be trying to keep ancient stuff going all the time.
[13:45:33] <arahael> amigojapan: Is it reliable? Have you cleaned it out and reseated the heat sink?
[13:45:37] <amigojapan> arahael: at the cram school we have 5 or 6 32 bit computers going
[13:45:47] <arahael> Not sure what 'cram school' is.
[13:45:57] <amigojapan> arahael: I have not done that
[13:46:15] <amigojapan> arahael: its a kind of after school school which is my main job
[13:46:50] <arahael> amigojapan: Well, you might not need to clean it out, but check the temperatures out and if they're looking suspect, then perhaps you do.  Some of the quite old systems end up having that heat sink compound somehow dry out.
[13:46:57] <arahael> amigojapan: And then they stop conducting heat.

[13:49:36] <pyzozord> mrig: have you seen the two new videos from Casey?
[13:49:43] <pyzozord> I watched the first part this morning
[13:49:45] <amigojapan> arahael: we start out with a blocked based visual programming language, then wse move on to a rel time intepreted language with 3d voxel abstractions
[13:49:50] <Th|ef> Th|ef .
[13:50:08] <amigojapan> arahael: then we move into python then we play around with arduino
[13:50:18] <vdamewood> Yum, Python!
[13:50:23] <arahael> amigojapan: Which blocked based visual programming language do you use?  I feel we've only barely scratched the surface of those.
[13:50:41] <amigojapan> vdamewood: but reaching pythin is after going thru a few educational languages
[13:50:43] <arahael> amigojapan: The electrical engineers are far ahead of us when it comes to visual languages. :(
[13:50:58] <amigojapan> arahael: is that a pun?
[13:51:06] <arahael> amigojapan: No.
[13:51:20] <arahael> amigojapan: I guess you're using the scratch language, then. :D
[13:51:21] <amigojapan> arahael: there is a famous visual programming language called scratch
[13:51:27] <amigojapan> yeah hahaha
[13:51:31] <arahael> Heh :)
[13:51:34] <amigojapan> no arahael I am using one I made
[13:52:06] <amigojapan> arahael: it has other features that scratch is missing, like functional blocks, and text terminal
[13:52:45] <amigojapan> arahael: also when you make games it users an update and a start functions, like normal game developers use
[13:52:57] <amigojapan> arahael: scratch sucks at those things
[13:52:59] <arahael> Nice.
[13:53:04] <arahael> Yeah, scratch is very very simplistic.
[13:53:05] <amigojapan> tyty
[13:53:27] <arahael> I've taught scratch a bit to my wife, who in turn teaches it a little to her class.
[13:53:48] <arahael> Only the very basics, though - they're primary school kids, so ages 5 through to 10-ish.
[13:53:52] <amigojapan> arahael: another good educational language, perhaps for before scratch is LOGO

[15:00:57] <vdamewood> It's a comma operator inside of parentheses. The comma operator avaluates the left side, then the right side, then yields the right side.

[15:24:09] <smallvil_> yea
[15:24:36] <smallvil_> but the tricky but is keeping track of all the regions
[15:24:51] <Donitz> by using a spatial grid, you can just keep your objects inside of grid cells, and not render the grid cells at all

[16:54:00] <smallvil_> eg region, draw, draw, region, draw, draw       the first two draws are associated to the first region, and the last two draws to the second region
[16:54:36] <smallvil_> with the region transparency being determined by the alpha value of each draw call if any
[16:55:23] <smallvil_> if if both draw calls have alpha 1.0 then the region is not transparent otherwise if any draw has a alpha of less than 1.0 then the region is transparent
[16:56:10] <Decker> sure
[16:56:36] <smallvil_> this could be futher optimized by marking each drawing call with a seperate region however this could lead to heavy work to determine occlusion for every draw command
[16:56:55] <smallvil_> (eg 6 regions instead of 2
[16:57:58] <smallvil_> which is further multiplied by sequenced command duplication
[16:59:02] <smallvil_> eg if a complex series of commands ultimately draws to the entire screen, and this entire set of commands is duplicated hundreds of times for idiomatic reasons, the only the final set of commands should be considered to be visible
[16:59:55] <smallvil_> however a lot of works needs to be done to determine this if every command is marked by a region, thiu hundreds of occulation tests and traversals are performed

[19:05:21] <pyzozord> I guess I should read man 3 exit
[19:05:37] <GeDaMo> [itchyjunk]: Forth! :P
[19:06:50] <InPhase> pyzozord: "thread safe" means that values and program flow remain well-defined matching what's written because all shared mutable accesses are controlled to happen one at a time and all threads are self-managed.
[19:07:53] <InPhase> pyzozord: Many C era functions were designed in a way such that global shared state is in use internally, making them not thread safe to use in more than one thread.
[19:09:00] <[itchyjunk]> GeDaMo, idk what that means :s
[19:09:32] <GeDaMo> Forth is a programming language
[19:09:39] <InPhase> But on top of that shared state in exit that makes concurrent calls of it undefined behavior, you should never attempt to exit while other threads are running anyway, as it violates the clean-up guarantees present in those threads.  Each thread should be responsible for exiting itself, perhaps with some sort of message telling it to exit.
[19:10:27] <pyzozord> InPhase: so it's essentially "non thread-safe" means "UB under threaded environment"?
[19:10:39] *** Joins: LiftLeft (~LiftLeft@gateway/vpn/pia/liftleft)
[19:11:11] <InPhase> pyzozord: Generally only UB under certain conditions.  Usually, concurrent calls to a library function, for that sort of thing, or concurrent accesses of a mutable variable.
[19:11:57] <InPhase> pyzozord: For variables the rule is no two things can write at the same time, and no two things can read or write at the same time, but many can read at the same time if nothing is modifying anything.
[19:12:28] <InPhase> pyzozord: Thus mutexes and such guard mutables, while good threaded architecture maximizes sharing immutable state when sharing is needed.

[20:22:42] <^-^hi> IOS lets you install Web Apps instead of stuff in App store, and you can put Emscripten in Web Apps?
[20:22:51] <oldlaptop> I don't mean "we wrote our website in it!", I mean widely-deployed pieces of infrastructure (such as production operating systems).

[20:24:16] <oldlaptop> Yes, it is.
[20:24:17] <flakonium_tubes> thats what we were discussing
[20:24:35] <manicennui> Even if you started today, it would take a decade to get an OS to the point where people want to use it.
[20:24:44] <flakonium_tubes> lets say they use linux
[20:24:56] <flakonium_tubes> what rust based system software are they running on top of it
[20:25:13] <oldlaptop> (It's also not the only thing I'd say would qualify - some widely-deployed DBMS, such as postgres/mysql/oracle/whatever would be an obvious case)
[20:25:25] <oldlaptop> s/whatever/whatever,
[20:25:55] <manicennui> I'm not sure why anyone cares about these kinds of measurements anyways.
[20:26:05] <flakonium_tubes> thats what we were discussing
[20:26:18] <manicennui> Just seems like typical geek bickering.
[20:26:31] <flakonium_tubes> everyone claims its a "systems language"
[20:26:33] <oldlaptop> I'm don't intend this as some sacreligious attack on your favorite language, if that's the issue here.
[20:26:35] <flakonium_tubes> so no its not bickering
[20:26:40] <oldlaptop> (I don't know what flakonium_tubes intends.)
[20:26:42] <manicennui> I don't care about Rust.
[20:26:46] <manicennui> I just think these discussions are dumb.
[20:26:50] <manicennui> And make geeks look dumb.
[20:26:51] <oldlaptop> That's nice.
[20:27:28] <flakonium_tubes> yes we shouldn't disucuss things

[21:13:30] <ishan> Hi there! What's the best way to get a subset of traffic flowing through a machine? I want to inspect/monitor all DHCP traffic flowing through an openwrt device and I want to do this on that openwrt device. 
[21:13:41] <ishan> There is stuff like tcpdump and pcap libraries like, https://github.com/ebfull/pcap

[21:14:03] <[itchyjunk]> Never done network analysis
[21:14:11] <[itchyjunk]> but don't people use wireshark or somesuch generally?
[21:14:15] <LiaoTao> ishan, Maybe tshark? I think you can do filters there.
[21:14:18] <ishan> I am just trying to figure out if this is a good way to do it considering the openwrt devices I will run this on is quite weak

[21:18:16] <LiaoTao> Sounds good
[21:18:17] <ishan> LiaoTao: Yes, I am in that channel but I usually only go there for networking problems. This is more of a programming problem I think 
[21:19:05] <mercenary> ishan: once you have the dhcp traffic, what do you want to do with it?
[21:19:13] <ishan> [itchyjunk]: Yes, That's the plan and there shouldn't be more than couple of kilobytes every few seconds/minutes. 
[21:19:15] <pyzozord> ah it's for some specific device, then I don't know
[21:19:44] <ishan> pyzozord: no no, wireshark/tcpdump/tshark is one popular way to do this. : )

[21:21:03] <ishan> mercenary: I run openwrt devices as dumb APs. When a host is connected to the openwrt client, It just shows the mac address and a '?' in the 'Host' column. I want to fix that. Commercial APs like the ones from UI or TP Link look for DHCP traffic and update the Host, IP address entries when they find that a device connected to the AP received a response from the DHCP server.
[21:21:17] <ishan> It's just a small QoL improvement 
[21:21:31] <ishan> to be able to see the dhcp hostname, ip address right there in the AP's interface

[22:09:48] <droid3> I have no problem creating databases and tables as well as sql /querying the database thru programs.
[22:10:04] <GeDaMo> Could you store them as blobs?
[22:10:08] <droid3> But its the choice of the datatypes for the columns of the tables
[22:10:19] <diophantoz> yea blobs are pretty big i think
[22:10:33] <diophantoz> or some binary format
[22:10:51] <droid3> blob are raw binary like if i was storing a executable file in a database or a dvd ..etc
[22:11:27] <Guest50> It's just weird that the string has stuff like this in it: <U+009D>
[22:11:58] <droid3> So there is 2 factors when choosing the datatypes for the columns of the database... 1) the size limits 2) the format that it is stored at for easy of not having to do ridiculous conversions between database and software program

[22:59:17] <manicennui> Using a RDBMS for metadata and storing the large BLOBs elsewhere is very common.
[22:59:25] <InPhase> droid3: If we tried to store all the data in a database it would be an unmitigated disaster.

[23:38:39] <droid3> But in my case i want to kind of max out size limits for columns and not use any database functions on the data just store and retrieve type stuff.
[23:39:07] <manicennui> Yes, but again, most RDBMS have problems with that.
[23:39:23] <manicennui> You are not going to be happy putting that much data in a BLOB column even if it's possible.
[23:39:26] <droid3> So in this case clob and blob are perfect for a simple app. Before i do it more robustly as talked about thru paths to files ...etc instead of blob/clob
[23:39:54] <manicennui> It will perform poorly, and you are likely to run into limitations with libraries/drivers/queries.

[23:41:05] <droid3> right and i agree with you eventually all do it paths and files outside database instead of whole blob object.
[23:41:22] <manicennui> You don't even have to do paths.
[23:41:28] *** Quits: M4tr1xXxXx (~M4tr1xXxX@5.121.86.90) (Client Quit)
[23:41:30] <manicennui> Just some kind of key that you know how to translate into a path.
[23:41:31] <droid3> But just as a test on smaller /medium size numbers to see that everything is working i am going to do it tonight the blob/clob way
[23:42:09] <droid3> yup just a key or path ...etc i got you and thats the way to go to make it right thanks for all the talk.
[23:42:27] <droid3> Just curious why did they create so many different datatypes for database.
[23:42:46] <droid3> I mean what is the purpose of long blob when you got blob and its the largest size ?
[23:43:06] *** Quits: b1101 (~b1101@pool-100-37-115-53.nycmny.fios.verizon.net) (Client Quit)
[23:43:44] <droid3> And why have so many datatypes different then most programming languages. Usually all programming languages have int , long , double , float ,...etc builtins yet database seem to have all that an a large amount more.

[23:44:31] <droid3> I never truely utilize all these datatypes for databases or even know when you want to use most of them. Passed the point of just finding the corrosponding datatypes to programming languages.
[23:45:14] <droid3> There are cases like dates/times ,...etc that are useful but we got varchar , long varchar , text ,...etc to choose from for just strings
[23:46:05] <droid3> why all these datatypes it just seems having some many redundant options makes database issues for conversions/querying from programming languages to databases /visa-versa.

[23:46:44] <droid3> Anyway lucky for me i am well aware of how to convert between the common datatypes or the ones that i dream of choosing from as of current.

[23:47:13] <Jaran> they are stored differently by the DB and by using the smallest datatype that need it might be more space/time efficient
[23:47:16] <droid3> Anybody answer on long blob???
[23:47:29] *** Joins: peteyboy1 (~peteyboy1@95.169.232.161)
[23:47:41] <Jaran> apart from that some other datatypes have different degrees of precision, compare sql decimals with double for example
[23:47:47] *** Quits: independent56 (~independe@2.31.88.37) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:47:58] <manicennui> droid3: Many of us have used these data types for storing large binary data, and have also been involved in moving them back out of the database.

[23:49:04] <droid3> curious what are the most common data types you use when dealing with different databases and designing columns in a tables
[23:49:34] <manicennui> int, varchar
[23:49:48] <manicennui> These days, bigint
[23:49:58] <manicennui> We've overflowed too many primary keys
[23:50:06] <Jaran> heh
[23:50:20] <Jaran> also decimal
[23:50:22] <manicennui> decimal for currency
[23:50:23] <droid3> And i agree sizes , precision are the key it just seems the database datatype well exceed programming language datatypes. And as a programming one knows sizes and precision with internal datatypes of most programming languages
[23:50:32] <Inst> hmmm
[23:50:33] <Inst> question
[23:50:40] <Inst> how bad form is it is create phantom classes
[23:50:49] <manicennui> What is a phantom class?
[23:50:59] <Inst> with the sole purpose of affixing and organizing functions?
[23:51:09] <droid3> so i would imagine knowing the programming langauge datatypes would corrospond to knowing what to always use in a database design as well. But there is just much more datatypes for the databases.

[23:51:55] <droid3> like i wouldnt ever use TEXT if i can just use VARCHAR or CLOB ...etc
[23:52:04] *** Quits: src (~src@user/src) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:52:32] <droid3> sometimes it just seems like the datatypes are in excess. But no worries i just stick to the main ones that i always use.
[23:53:58] <droid3> It just would be nice to know of when these other datatypes come in handy because it seems never
[23:54:56] <droid3> Anyway thanks for the talk all stop my rambling on datatypes of database design now. All set back to creating it all thanks again guys

[23:57:50] <droid3> O i guess longblob is the blob = 4GB max size and blob is the 64kb , tinyblob = 256bytes ,...etc for mysql in particular. :)
[23:59:48] <phogg> postgres makes it easy: text? Use text.
[23:59:53] <droid3> bit and bool to both the same some database have bit others have bool
