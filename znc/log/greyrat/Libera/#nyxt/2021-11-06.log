[18:28:43] <Jing> pjb: But I did encounter a problem, in which after I run "(nyxt:start :verbose t :no-init t)" it displays "<DEBUG> [21:59:19] nyxt gi-gtk.lisp (ffi-initialize gtk-browser) - Initializing GI-GTK Interface"
[18:32:42] <pjb> Jing: debug messages don't signal problems.
[18:32:59] <pjb> Jing: check for warning or error messages.
[18:33:45] <Jing> pjb: No warnings or errors. More details here:https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/issues/1855
[18:35:12] <pjb> You're running on MS-Windows and you want to use a X server to display the windows, correct?
[18:35:32] <pjb> Ah no from macOS and use a X server?
[18:35:50] <Jing> Mac OS High Sierra 10.13.6 with XQuartz
[18:36:09] <pjb> (ccl:getenv "DISPLAY") #| --> "/private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.jOqlVJfwRt/org.xquartz:0" |#
[18:36:16] <pjb> what do you get?
[18:37:21] <Jing> "/private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.kh2w8DbWOQ/org.xquartz:0"
[18:37:26] <pjb> Sounds good.
[18:38:51] <pjb> Do you have a simple X program to test?  eg. (uiop:run-program "/opt/X11/bin/xclock")
[18:39:27] <Jing> Displays a clock correctly
[18:40:11] <Jing> Also have xman and xlogo, both work
[18:41:40] <pjb> Great.
[18:41:45] <pjb> So there's a problem with nyxt.
[18:42:01] <pjb> Unfortunately, I've not used it yet. Wait for the author to be present and ask him.
[18:43:21] <Jing> :( Interesting, I thought there was something wrong with my XQuartz... Still thank you for your help. Yeah I am waiting
