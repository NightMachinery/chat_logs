[16:22:29] <xnaas> Seen so many questions about oidentd lately
[16:22:55] <bookworm> yeah, one would wonder why considering how useful ident is
[16:22:55] <xnaas> did a bunch of people just discover IRC and get a weird or bad guide saying they need to use it? Lol
[16:23:02] <bookworm> probably
[16:23:21] <bookworm> also fun is the ratio pf people who understood the TL docs... 0/3
[16:23:41] <xnaas> ðŸ™ƒ
[16:23:48] <bookworm> meaning yet another thing to rewrite that isn't even useful
[16:25:12] <bookworm> might just be a nock switch though
[16:26:05] <bookworm> coderkaylan or whatever switched their nick to like 3 random ones whenever they were asking the same question they've already been given the answer to
[16:26:24] <bookworm> only to be given the exact same answer... go figure
[16:27:07] <bookworm> can't quite remember what it was though
[16:29:26] <xnaas> Classic. "Maybe they just hate my username, let's try another!"
[16:39:33] <Activ8> 1 important line to add to the docs "choose 1 out of the 3 methods" lol
[16:40:34] <Activ8> I assumed (by the guide) that ident and oidentd was the same.  until I was told.

[20:28:28] <Activ8> they should in dangerous environments they save lives if they work correctly
[20:28:37] <redoc> thats the first thing im doing if i get one of them
