[03:18:56] <Rainier> georgios, depends. Most times it's recommended to link in stylesheets externally, but there can be cases where (due to platform/system/etc. restrictions) you're stuck with style tags. Style tags can also be used to inline stylesheets by an automated build system, but not a big fan of that.
[03:19:06] <Rainier> In short, most regular web sites should just link to stylesheets.

[12:01:28] <^PAL_man^> hi guys i think i am missing something, is there is a reason for a css to work when its external, but when i copy it to the local site it doesnt?
[12:02:01] <^PAL_man^> and yes i did copy it properly
[12:02:06] <CoJaBo> paths messed up for includes/resources?
[12:05:25] <^PAL_man^> not that i can see
[12:06:49] <^PAL_man^> r u familiar with visual code studio? as in can i load in the css from an url ?
[12:09:48] <^PAL_man^> essentially it is overwritting my own font sizes, so i am experimenting to fix it, so first i tried copying the whole css over and am trying to alter that css,
[12:10:16] <^PAL_man^> but it doesnt seem to work right with the original css on my own site
[12:10:39] <^PAL_man^> https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/4/w3.css this css specifically
[12:12:59] <^PAL_man^> ironically all i want to do is have multiple slideshows on a page, which works great, but created the over write of my own font sizes
[12:14:59] <^PAL_man^> hence my assumption line 27 28 is doing that

[13:00:31] <deltab> ^PAL_man^: what's not working?
[13:00:56] <fweht> i saw that tailwind defines `col-span-n` as `grid-column: span n / span n` but my understanding of `span` is that it makes only sense if only start or end is a span and the other is a fixed value?  like `grid-column: 2 / span 4` or `grid-column: span 1 / 3`?
[13:01:42] <^PAL_man^> hi deltab well if i use the css from the w3 site the multiple slideshows work perfectly ......
[13:02:16] <^PAL_man^> however what it does is alter all my h1 h2 etc stuff,  so all the text is now much bigger than the rest of the site.
[13:03:33] <fweht> ah nvm i understand now
[13:03:37] <^PAL_man^> So i take the css from w3 and place it onto my site, but its doesnt seem to kick in at all, as in the font don't alter at all, and the forward back options on the slideshows are no longer in the pictures but underneath
[13:15:31] <deltab> ^PAL_man^: have you checked the console for error messages?
[13:17:58] <deltab> fweht: aha, found in 8.3.1. Grid Placement Conflict Handling: If the [1303]placement contains two spans, remove the one contributed by the [1304]end [1305]grid-placement property.
[13:19:13] <fweht> deltab: ah interesting, so why does tailwind then put two spans if one gets removed anyway?
[13:19:16] <^PAL_man^> deltab: i get the same error on both but none refer to the fonts, error being This page uses the non standard property “zoom”. Consider using calc() in the relevant property values, or using “transform” along with “transform-origin: 0 0”.
[13:19:28] <deltab> fweht: no idea
[13:19:53] <fweht> deltab: maybe i should stick to hand written css
[13:19:59] <deltab> fweht: oh, maybe for if the start or end gets overridden
[13:20:17] <fweht> deltab: yes that makes sense!
[13:20:35] <fweht> so a single property always overwrites a combined propert?
[13:21:16] <deltab> it's ashorthand, equivalent to setting start and end separately
[13:21:39] <^PAL_man^> i have actually looking at a different layout using different code, i was just couldnt work out why css externally was reacting differently to locally thats all
[13:21:42] <fweht> i see
[13:22:22] <fweht> grid is pretty cool :)
[13:23:18] <deltab> ^PAL_man^: try reducing your stylesheet to something very simple that you can verify works, then add parts back until it stops working
[13:23:59] <fweht> hopefully the major browsers will implement subgrid soon
[13:25:47] <^PAL_man^> indeed deltab thats what i was going for re the line 27 /28 as thats the bit that directly affects my fonts. Anyway thank you for your time, i got a few other bits to concentrate on then i'll get back to this
