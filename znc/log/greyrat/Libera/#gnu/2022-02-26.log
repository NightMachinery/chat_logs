[02:19:14] <isf> xd
[02:23:08] <Kaiod> <isf> "that is you trying to say kaiod?" <- No, being honest with you, you usually elevate and explain everything on a more extreme level. Not everyone reads and knows RMS, and some don't care what he talks about, but rather the philosophy of the free software movement that is built collectively. Not everyone has the same knowledge as you, and you have to be patient to explain things slowly and didactically, there are people who don't even have
[02:23:08] <Kaiod> freedom, nor good technological conditions, and you speak broadly as if we are going to conquer our objective by forcibly inserting an idea into people's heads, we will convince with a philosophy that should be taught to people, and not attack them if they don't know about it.
[02:23:31] <isf> im not forcing
[02:23:32] <isf> lol
[02:24:08] <Kaiod> If I am not mistaken, this is not the first time I have talked about this with you. I don't want to attack you, or criticize you, but rather explain why, many times, some people don't understand anything you say.
[02:24:16] <isf> i dont care
[02:24:25] <isf> dude, im literal sharing articles of the gnu project
[02:24:45] <isf> and you are saying things subjetives about how you feel becouse you dont like how im
[02:25:24] <Kaiod> isf: I'm sorry, but yes, you explain and share physiology in a forced way, and in my opinion, this is not positive.
[02:25:26] <isf> if you want do something better i do
[02:25:27] <isf> do it

[02:27:04] <Kaiod> Then it should follow a more educational method, and not pass on articles as if it were an obligation. It is an exchange of knowledge, it shouldn't be something like this.
[02:27:12] <isf> do it if you want dude
[02:27:34] <isf> be better than me please
[02:28:03] <isf> becouse normaly i never see you defending the free software movements or ideals

[02:30:13] <Kaiod> You don't see me because I work directly, and pass on the knowledge personally. I implement what I know in the government of Brazil, I pass on free software in universities and schools in my country, I also manage the Libreplanet Wiki, and now I'm GNU Webmaster.

[02:34:28] <tesseract> turkey also want to switch to gnu/Linux but they can't because some software only work on linux

[02:37:36] <isf> a big example of that, all state distros are nonfree distros.
