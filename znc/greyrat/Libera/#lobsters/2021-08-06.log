[02:01:29] <goodger[m]> slow clap
[02:01:58] <companion_cube> linking to issues to say "it's not complete at all" is also bad faith, a lot of these are improvements, not glaring holes
[02:02:58] <edk> its readme says up front that it's not a spec or intended to be though
[02:03:14] <kline> regardless of how we feel about it, the current situation is that rust trundles along with several aspirational specifications of which none appear to be complete and correct

[02:03:24] <goodger[m]> so the answer is no, it doesn't have a spec
[02:03:26] <edk> i think the rust people are just fine with not having a spec for now
[02:03:27] <companion_cube> yes, indeed, none are complete
[02:03:36] <kline> edk, sure, thats fine
[02:03:51] <kline> not having a spec and being ok with that internally is ok
[02:03:52] <companion_cube> but it's not like they totally ignore the problem either
[02:03:57] <kline> but that doesnt mean the language is ready to go
[02:04:14] <companion_cube> when is a language ready to go then?
[02:04:19] <companion_cube> when everything is polished?
[02:04:20] <kline> and more importantly rust people should stop knee-jerking to say "but it is specified" and "well it taken c a long time too!"
[02:04:28] <companion_cube> fuck yes
[02:04:38] <kline> companion_cube | when is a language ready to go then?
[02:04:44] <edk> i mean ready to go is not one thing, right
[02:04:47] <kline> i think thats reasonably aspirational across all languages
[02:04:47] <companion_cube> C couldn't do threads before 2011, right?
[02:04:53] <edk> lots of people are using rust and they seem to be quite happy
[02:04:54] <companion_cube> because it wasn't in the spec!
[02:04:57] <edk> yeah, but C on POSIX could
[02:05:01] <edk> that's still a spec
[02:05:02] <kline> but there are definitely certain things you cant hit with rust
[02:05:22] <edk> i do broadly agree though. lots of users don't need everything they use to have a spec
[02:05:30] <kline> i agree
[02:05:34] <kline> and i use rust as well
[02:05:45] <edk> the world was fine with linux being written in "whatever GCC accepts" until clang happened to come along
[02:05:50] <kline> but theres still no spec
[02:05:52] <edk> for instance
[02:05:57] <companion_cube> there's a reference
[02:06:10] <companion_cube> what do you look for in a spec, that isn't in the reference?
[02:06:11] <kline> and for a language, not having a set of authoritative documents imo is a fairly big deal, from the language perspective
[02:06:12] <companion_cube> formal logic?
[02:06:38] <edk> companion_cube: precise enough definitions that you could implement the language from first principles and compile any correct program
[02:06:39] <kline> companion_cube, can i get an authoritative grammar?
[02:06:55] <companion_cube> https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/expressions/loop-expr.html <--- the grammar is in each construct

[02:06:56] <kline> like, at the very least i need to be able to check something is valid syntax
[02:07:44] <companion_cube> edk: yeah that sounds nice, but for rust it's going to be as aspirational as for C++
[02:07:47] <edk> yeah
[02:07:49] <kline> companion_cube, are those grammar definitions complete, correct, and authoritative/?
[02:07:54] <companion_cube> no one writes a C++ compiler from the specs
[02:08:03] <kline> fwiw, i still have nothing inherently against not having a spec as a user
[02:08:05] <edk> i think it's reasonable to ask for this if you're working to military/aerospace HA standards
[02:08:18] <companion_cube> clearly it's not there for aerospace and the likes

[02:11:46] <meff[m]> It's really interesting that people care so much about that
[02:12:02] <meff[m]> I mean not specs or the lack thereof. The reaction that makes someone defensive.
[02:12:26] <dongbei> aren't there enough people watching what goes into the language via the maintainers and developers to keep them from doing anything sketchy?
[02:12:30] <dongbei> at least for the time being?
[02:12:33] <meff[m]> It makes me feel like Rust in specific, and PL in general, is a bit like an Identity
[02:12:50] <companion_cube> It is
[02:12:58] <kline> dongbei, its really not much about that as it being, imo, bad programming-language-science practice, if it makes sense
[02:13:36] <kline> its hard to talk shit about python being a poorly designed language (which it is) while stanning a language without a spec at all
[02:13:49] <meff[m]> idk, once something becomes an Identity, it ceases to be something that people talk about rationally
[02:13:57] <dongbei> i feel like at some point someone will fork rust and call it Simple Rust: Rust for Humans or something

[02:15:19] <kline> you might say that, but a major factor in cpython cruft is a desire not to fuck up cpythons implementation of the published spec
[02:15:56] <companion_cube> The spec and the C API
[02:16:02] <kline> there was a whole thing about reimplementing the parser to enable some stuff that had to wait until python 3 because they didnt want to break the language even if they could just arbitrarily do it in cpython
[02:16:08] <companion_cube> Well they also want to keep the interpreter simple

[02:16:44] <kline> i cant even remember what it was, and im not talking about the language details, i mean there was literally stuff they wanted to do that couldnt be done easily with how cpythons parser was implemented and they didnt want to fuck with the public grammar just to make cpython easier
[02:17:24] <companion_cube> The parser and grammar really should be decoupled :s
[02:17:31] <kline> which i think kind of addresses the idea of "yeah but the python spec is just cpython", which may or may not be true but certainly id suggest that cpython bending to the spec means that inconsistencies in other implementations is a fault of the implementation
[02:17:46] <kline> not that the spec just follows cpythons way of doing things after the fact
[02:18:24] <companion_cube> Oh for sure. It's in the C API that they do their own non standard thing everyone depends on
[02:19:00] <kline> is cpythons c api implementation anything really to do with the language design?
[02:19:18] <companion_cube> It is if all code depends on it
[02:19:28] <kline> im not talking about rustc or cpython or anything, i literally mean "from the perspective of language design, how do they compare?"
[02:19:42] <companion_cube> Ah, well, ok.
[02:19:48] <companion_cube> Python is much simpler
[02:19:52] <kline> id say that rust is better than python in terms of design, but python actually realises that better
[02:20:06] <companion_cube> Because it's a dynamically typed, OO language
[02:20:16] <companion_cube> So it's easy to specify
[02:20:25] <technomancy> OO doesn't make things simpler
[02:20:30] <companion_cube> Like, you don't even need to talk about memory layout or concurrency
[02:20:50] <kline> is rusts memory layout, say, in structs, stable and specified?
[02:20:52] <companion_cube> I'm sure `is` is unspecified, as well
[02:21:09] <companion_cube> It's specified to be implementation dependent :)
[02:21:21] <companion_cube> And you cannot observe it from safe rust
[02:21:25] <kline> thats good, thats important
[02:21:51] <companion_cube> (you can use repr(C) to actually force it to be C compatible)
[02:21:57] <kline> but i dont think you can say "its harder to specify rust than python because python doesnt care about memory layout" but then in rust have the spec just say "large parts of memory layout are outside the spec"
[02:22:22] <companion_cube> I mean rust has stuff like Box
[02:22:31] <rak> aren't there significant efforts to formally specify the rust memory model?
[02:22:45] <companion_cube> There are, just like for C and C++
[02:22:52] <kline> rak, perhaps, but its a post hoc thing
[02:23:05] <companion_cube> I think they're pretty close actually, at least for the concurrency

[12:43:50] <riv> dongbei, yes i would like to hear about that
[12:43:56] <riv> (sorting)
[12:44:12] <dongbei> riv: i thought you were a special bit for a second
[12:44:18] <dongbei> because of my amazing lobster
[12:44:19] <dongbei> anyways
[12:44:34] <epilys> is a bit a small bot?
[12:44:55] <dongbei> assume I can type correctly :)
[12:45:12] <varjag> https://goomics.net/35/
[12:45:12] <mockturtle> [ 35 ] - goomics.net
[12:45:16] <varjag> as everyone suspected
[12:45:22] <epilys> dongbei, special bit sounds endearing :)
[12:45:34] <varjag> also, you know it's the real googlers comic cuz the ux sucks
[12:45:39] <epilys> varjag, how many meetings did this take?
[12:46:21] <varjag> epilys: there are 6 PMs listed, so my lower bound is 6, the upper is 6!
[12:46:24] <dongbei> ok so for sorting tons of objects, let's say a million objects, you can do it with objectarray.sort()
[12:46:35] <dongbei> but that's single threaded and stupid because it locks up your page
[12:46:53] <dongbei> it's 2021 so lets use webworkers
[12:47:04] <iDrougge> 🤦
[12:47:25] <dongbei> so you can send the entire array to a webworker and sort it there, cool, your page no longer locks up
[12:47:30] <dongbei> but it's still single threaded and stupid
[12:48:15] <dongbei> so lets use lots of webworkers, one per core
[12:48:31] <dongbei> and lets splice our array into equal sizes, one per core
[12:48:50] <dongbei> and instead of relying on structured cloning like a chump, we do a JSON.stringify()
[12:49:07] <riv> nice
[12:49:23] <dongbei> sort them each on their webworker then collect them and sort them one more on your ui thread
[12:49:45] <dongbei> congrats you just beat the single threaded performance and prevented locking up your page
[12:49:48] <dongbei> you are a boss
[12:50:21] <iDrougge> Why stringify?
[12:50:40] <dongbei> funny thing is that structure cloning is slower than JSON.stringify(), slower than SharedArrayBuffers and slower than a JSON.stringify() -> TextEncode.encode() to Uint8Array
[12:51:02] <dongbei> or rather JSON.stringify() is faster than all of them
[12:51:13] <iDrougge> 🤦🤦
[12:51:31] <dongbei> and the SharedArrayBuffer has been sitting here https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1012656&q=SharedArrayBuffer&can=2
[12:51:31] <mockturtle> [ 1012656 - chromium - An open-source project to help move the web forward. - Monorail ] - bugs.chromium.org
[12:51:41] <dongbei> for the past year or so waiting to be fixed
[12:51:58] <dongbei> so I can actually write to it rather than making a copy from a temporary array
[12:52:03] <dongbei> stupid crap
[12:52:14] <dongbei> anyways, i'm done i just wanted to tell someone
[12:52:20] <dongbei> so thanks
[12:53:28] <dongbei> ah btw someone might ask you about protobufs or flatbuffers or msgpack
[12:53:43] <dongbei> you can tell them that they're slower for any object that contains a majority of strings.
[12:53:50] <epilys> dongbei, you're like that Pokemon NPC that explains to you how to use a pokeball and you can't skip the whole dialogue
[12:54:21] <dongbei> epilys: tapping a furiously, eh?
[12:54:32] <epilys> i broke it
[12:54:34] <epilys> dmn it
[12:56:09] <Brekkjern> The only missing thing is for the text to be shown in your IRC client one symbol at the time
[12:56:22] <Brekkjern> I guess you could run a CPU stresser to emulate that?
[12:58:50] <dongbei> oh epilys does that mean you already knew what I was talking about?
[12:59:14] <dongbei> if so could you tell me if I'm wrong?  I've seriously been spending my entire day trying to speed up this stupid sort

[22:36:47] <technomancy> ignaloidas: I would; classes suck

[22:41:11] <gwozniak> indigo: I suspect that if GCC's code base were more C++-ish, it would be easier to follow in some ways
[22:41:35] <gwozniak> The extensive use of crazy macros can be really tough to navigate
[22:41:55] <cb> bloat is caused by <> generics syntax
[22:42:00] <cb> we know this because c++
[22:42:12] <ignaloidas> lol
[22:42:29] <indigo> I don't know what's worse, wild macros or <T,<U,V,<templates>>>
[22:42:55] <manicennui> Now add some lifetimes.

[22:44:36] <gwozniak> I did dip into the hash table stuff in GCC and it was all templates. I found it better than (but not optimal) the macro stuff
