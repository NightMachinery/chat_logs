[00:00:12] <blueagain> we'd done the whole deal, got a scrum training, bootstrapping/onboarding, the whole deal
[00:00:52] <ashnur> obviously not what i am talking about
[00:02:20] <blueagain> if you're told to write a parser, but you have never written a parser before, how are you going to estimate how long it would take you?
[00:02:28] <blueagain> this is just nonsense
[00:02:34] <blueagain> estimates are nonsense
[00:03:00] <systemfault> Still less nonsense than what people were doing before agile..
[00:03:25] <systemfault> That parser of yours can be split into multiple tasks
[00:03:54] <ashnur> lol, but scrum is just forcing waterfall into agile communication
[00:04:09] <ashnur> it's not actually agile, not even if you try and do everything 100% properly
[00:04:13] <ashnur> it's still process over people
[00:04:31] <ashnur> you still can't give or receive direct feedback outside the team
[00:04:58] <blueagain> breaking down doesn't make it easier. my point is that if you can accurately estimate, down to the hour/day, how long it would take to do something, then it's probably trivial enough that you should've automated it already
[00:05:14] <systemfault> I understand your point... but project managers need some level of visibility on the advancement of the project.
[00:05:22] <ashnur> lol
[00:05:34] <ashnur> wishful thinking is not really a justification in my book
[00:06:13] <systemfault> Take the estimate the dev gives.... multiply it by X and add an extra buffer in cases where something goes terribly wrong.
[00:06:18] <KevinX> it's pretty easy to estimate the happy path on most things
[00:06:27] <blueagain> if you need longer than the estimate, then you just need longer. the project managers will need to wait
[00:06:37] <blueagain> and in some extreme cases, the task is simply impossible
[00:07:14] <systemfault> blueagain: Sure, as long as you tell the PM as soon as you know you won't make it.
[00:07:42] <blueagain> systemfault: so it's only about communicating progress? in that case, it's doable without the scrum overhead

[00:07:55] <systemfault> Personally, most tasks are easy to estimate, it depends on the number of "unknowns"
[00:08:19] <systemfault> blueagain: They still need to give their superior/client some date.
[00:08:34] <blueagain> systemfault: what happens if the product isn't deliverable by that date?

[00:36:24] <blueagain> er, assuade is not a word
[00:36:35] <sheetjs> the defaults are not sane, and certainly some very vocal JS developers believe it is ok to keep the defaults if it dissuades people from using the language

[00:39:52] <blahboybaz> systemfault: The way I want to structure my resoponse is to tell him it depends, offer some factors that contribute to the differences in cost, offer him a description of a simple site (some of the features it would include) and a ballpark range for that example, ask him some pointed questions about his requirements, then finish wiht an offer to consult over zoom to iron out the details. Here's
[00:39:58] <blahboybaz> what I have so far..
[00:40:00] <blahboybaz> https://pastebin.com/Y3Ty6qCd
[00:40:03] <blahboybaz> I live in the US and its just the part in the < > brackets I need to replace with a realistic cost range for the example being given.
[00:40:20] <sheetjs> blueagain: there's today's cost and the future costs
[00:40:39] <sheetjs> the future cost of forking is ... maintaining a fork
[00:41:11] <blueagain> hence 'soft', you change your painful points, but keep rebasing on the original
[00:41:12] <buu> sheetjs: don't you have a dishwasher?
[00:41:40] <buu> blahboybaz: I charge based entirely on how annoyed I am with the work
[00:42:08] <buu> blahboybaz: but generally speaking, if you can get away with it, avoid being locked into fixed price contracts where people are likely to request changes on you
[00:42:09] <sheetjs> heh another story time: we did that with a zip library "jszip" until they wiped the sync API in jszip 3
[00:42:14] <blueagain> I see it going in two directions, either the fork remains soft, which is less work for you, or it becomes a better tool than eslint for your purposes, in which case it's an investment in the future
[00:42:39] <sheetjs> the goal is not to reinvent the entire stack
[00:42:48] <blahboybaz> buu: That sounds solid but how to get someone to agree to a blank check?

[00:44:16] <buu> blahboybaz: In otherwords, something like "a website" is obviously very vague, "a word press install" is more specific and you can have a more specific price
[00:44:20] <blueagain> if the developers were cooperative it'd be a whole different ball game
[00:44:46] <buu> blahboybaz: Depends on the, uh, sophistication of the client. A highly sophisticated one you can just do hourly and go from there
[00:44:54] <blueagain> more pain*
[00:44:59] <sheetjs> there's a meta-problem of actually finding more developers
[00:45:00] <buu> Below that you just need to be very specific about what you're both agreeing to
[00:45:01] <systemfault> blahboybaz: You just want to have a discussion with the client first... Otherwise, your range is going to be ridiculous (Like 1000-50000)
[00:45:12] <buu> yeah
[00:45:14] <blahboybaz> My best, intuitive guess, would be to replace < > wtih $300 - 500 and then upsell in the negotiation / consultation that follows based on his actual requrements. The final cost could be very different to the sample cost I give just to get him to engage

[01:12:25] <blahboybaz> 12 or less
[01:12:42] <blueagain> sheetjs: how much of the contributions to your projects come from volunteers?
[01:13:20] <sheetjs> the metrics don't tell the full story
[01:13:27] <blahboybaz> I'm not talking about deployment to him at this stage. I'm just getting the hook set (get him to bit on havine a zoom consult). It's in that consultation that the magic is supposed to happen.
[01:13:53] <sheetjs> someone will find a bug, we'll propose a solution and the user will contribute a PR
[01:14:08] <blahboybaz> I'm telling him an example cost for an example design (design only) then upsell to his budget and requrements not excluding development and deployment

[05:51:05] <systemfault> That counts.
[05:51:14] <kalen> practically every aspect of general web development is easier with svelte and sveltekit. it's minimalistic, lightweight, blazingly fast, intuitive, easy to learn, minimal boilerplate, and you can develop apps way faster and more enjoyably than with react

[06:06:08] <banana_> JS history?
[06:06:09] <kalen> the fact that the *oldest* codebase you've ever had to maintain is just 7 years old suggests that your experience is novice to intermediate level. so i find it rather striking that you would have such a hard-nosed opinion about what constitutes "bad" or shitty ideas in programming. you might want to  show a little more humility in your opinions given the circumstance
[06:06:52] <duckgoose> uhoh

[06:34:49] <prodigius> it was contentious even in the 90's lol.
[06:35:15] <ThePendulum> bit confused by this, they say 'third party cookies' are cookies that stick around after you close the browser, and those require consent
[06:35:20] <prodigius> We can thank the EU for this ThePendulum.
[06:35:33] <prodigius> And I'm all for the EU myself.
[06:35:37] <ThePendulum> do you need to ask consent for tracking cookies that send statistics to your own server?

[06:47:18] <kalen> @ljharb, i'm a pragmatist, not a purist, so i couldn't care less if svelte is "not js" (whatever you might mean by that). what matters to me are things like performance, ease of use, readability, etc... you know, productivity. @edfletcher 1) i said "suggests", not "proves", 2) i was using the other guy's metric for ironic effect, and 3) that particular hypothetical of yours seemed rather pedantic and far-fetched for how things typically go in

[06:47:53] <ljharb> what i mean is, that things that look like js but aren’t rarely survive.
[06:48:10] <ljharb> so anything built in svelte is likely tech debt in the future, more than normal.
[06:49:04] <kalen> if svelte had come out right around the time as react did, i would bet that it would've been svelte that survived, not react
[06:49:19] <trafficjam> anyone know how to `git push` using `gh`?
[06:49:22] <kalen> timing was everything
[06:49:43] <trafficjam> for some stupid reason github has retired username/pass authentication
[06:49:58] <trafficjam> and because my network blocks all ports except 80 and 443, i can't git push anymore
[06:50:12] <jasonaowen> time to fix your network
[06:50:23] <trafficjam> it's a public network, that's not an option
[06:50:47] <kalen> in the end, you might be right. but as of right now, svelte is still gaining in popularity. it's not showing any sign of abandonment
[06:51:08] <kalen> if anything, i think it's react that seems to have somewhat stagnated

[07:03:15] <buu> theskillwithin: https://www.twitch.tv/buubirds bird butt
[07:03:34] <buu> Vite is the bundler created by the vuejs guys right?
[07:03:44] <buu> I assume any bundler that isn't webpack gets a positive response these days
[07:04:55] <buu> trafficjam: what is your github remote url?
[07:05:11] <trafficjam> why?
[07:05:17] <buu> When you git clone, git fetch, git pull, or git push to a remote repository using HTTPS URLs on the command line, Git will ask for your GitHub username and password. When Git prompts you for your password, enter your personal access token (PAT) instead. Password-based authentication for Git has been removed, and using a PAT is more secure. For more information, see "Creating a personal access token."
[07:05:42] <trafficjam> ah yeah, someone told me to use the access token instead of password
[07:05:56] <trafficjam> is that username/password prompt from git client?

[08:10:34] <kalen> is not the product of marketing gimmicks. if anything, it's REACT that maintains its popularity through "constant marketing", as you call it

[08:19:16] <kalen> many (most?) who have tried svelte would love to stick with it. oftentimes, they only go back to react out of necessity because that happens to be what their employer/project is already using and requiring. svelte thrives based on MERIT. react thrives largely because it's been "the thing" for a while, a de facto standard of sorts with a large community, and something that people are generally used to and don't feel a strong need to abandon

[08:52:13] <ashnur> as if I don't know
[08:53:16] <theskillwithin> i don't believe anyone is trolling, however at a glance I fail to see a productive end here.  its not uncommon for dev x to like something and dev y to like something else.  in the end, who gives a fuck
[08:53:19] <ashnur> in fact, they could be a framework if they had proper state management, but they kinda avoided it so far :D mixins, classes v1, classesv2 HOCs, render props, and now Hooks.
[08:53:37] <KevinX> you seemed to be looping react into this, but maybe i was wrong there
[08:53:38] <ashnur> react18 will have finally what I need, useExternalSource
[08:53:58] <ashnur> I said that I wouldn't mind not using it, I didn't say it was the same as svelte or nextjs
[08:54:33] <KevinX> frameworks are still just tools though. the better developers learn and understand how they work just like a master craftsman would
[08:54:57] <ashnur> the whole point of a good library is that you are not attached to it, so I guess that's also a compliment for react
[08:54:58] <KevinX> you do end up with technical debt though, but again that's something good developers understand
[08:55:18] <ashnur> 'just tools' is not an immediate justification
[08:56:31] <KevinX> a framework like nextjs abstracts the annoying stuff that I dont want to do
[08:56:48] <theskillwithin> <3 nextjs and gatsby
[08:57:01] <KevinX> however, im hirable because i know what all those things are and understand how they operate
[08:57:06] <ashnur> yeah, it's all about developer convenience, but it's not thought out
[08:57:28] <ashnur> or rather, the people doing it are serving a specific niche that cares more about paperwork than quality
[08:57:42] <KevinX> i would argue nextjs promotes quality for 95% of people
[08:57:52] <kalen> ashnur, i find it amazing that you would accuse me of engaging in sophistry while pointing me to a comment that is engaging in *exactly* that. that 7yo comment is philosophical mumbo jumbo dealing in theoretical edge cases rather than general cases in PRACTICE. in practice, "fighting" the framework is generally not an issue. typically, that's only an issue when you're dealing with some low-level, highly specialized and esoteric, especially with
[08:57:52] <kalen> very mature frameworks with years of widespread use
[08:58:00] <KevinX> The image component alone
[08:58:35] <ashnur> god i hate that image component
[08:58:36] <KevinX> the edge middleware next + vercel provides is something most developers will never understand
[08:58:51] <ashnur> i am fighting nextjs every day, it's not fun
[08:59:15] <KevinX> its annoying at time, but it's better than what you see on the web today
[08:59:20] <ashnur> lol
[08:59:21] <kalen> you're giving up all the advantages that a robust, mature framework provides to deal with some RARE potential edge case that you probably won't even run into. ON BALANCE, refusing to use a framework will probably cost you even more headaches in the long run
[08:59:36] <ashnur> this is why i call it sophistry, you need to relativize it so you can justify it
[08:59:46] <ashnur> only in comparison with your worse experience can it gain value
[08:59:47] <theskillwithin> ashnur ya the nextjs image component kinda sucks.  but its new, i hope they improve.   its sort of a response to the gatsby one which is much better
[09:00:07] <KevinX> they improve the image component every release though so hard to judge that one anyway
[09:00:08] <theskillwithin> next.js and gatsby are encroaching on each others territory now
[09:00:29] <ashnur> kalen, don't assume that you are giving up anything
[09:00:49] <KevinX> is there a mature JS framework?
[09:01:02] <ashnur> it's a different approach, it takes me longer to achieve what you get out of the box. but it will be an overall better system

[09:01:19] <theskillwithin> oops
[09:01:22] <Jigsy> ?
[09:01:33] <kalen> ashnur, that reddit comment is what is sophistry. i'm arguing from a pragmatic and realistic point of view, which is the exact *opposite* of sophistry
[09:02:27] *** Joins: The_Blode (~Blode@user/the-blode/x-7164444)
[09:02:52] <ashnur> you are saying that, but that's not what I've seen so far. All your arguments boiled down to "it's written by a better programmer than you" "people like it and talk about it" "i am right because i say so"
[09:03:07] <theskillwithin> ashnur btw I think learning next.js is a great thing to be doing
[09:03:24] <ashnur> meanwhile, substack argument is actually stemming from harcore practice, i can't believe someone would question one of the most prolific npm author's experience...
[09:04:57] <ashnur> and he says that the assumptions of frameworks will clash with your own needs, no matter which framework you pick. I do believe there is an exception to this, if all you do is 6 months projects, then you never run into problems, and I've seen lots of people doing this and I totally attribute the popularity of these fancy frameworks to these half year contractors.
[09:05:37] <ashnur> that's why I asked about your experience and was, and still am surprised, that someone who has lots of experience can still choose immediate convenience over long term benefits
[09:06:32] <ashnur> and the cherry on the top is that in the past 7 years since I first read that comment, I've come to learn a little bit of complexity science and turns out that there are good scientific reasons behind these arguments
[09:06:55] <ashnur> so I can't really just take your word that all this is not true and I should change my mind

[09:12:21] <kalen> it's better because you wrote it rather than someone else?
[09:12:51] <ashnur> if i had to say it my way, i would say that frameworks limit your future choices and by the time you realize you should choose something different, you have invested too much to change
[09:13:09] <ashnur> definitely not better because I wrote it, I am not a very good programmer
[09:13:13] <kalen> ashnur, do you have a github account? i'd like to see some examples of this superior/better code of yours

[09:16:26] <ljharb> damnit, you made me scroll up a whole page
[09:16:36] <ljharb> so that's a fine comment
[09:16:50] <ljharb> but also, stridently eschewing frameworks is rarely a good decision either
[09:17:15] <kalen> ashnur, for someone who admits to not being a very good programmer, i'd argue that it's even *MORE* advisable for that person to use a framework
[09:17:27] <kalen> i thought you were coming from the standpoint of being some sort of programming guru

[09:36:46] <systemfault> I quickly looked at Svelte just now, it doesn't look bad... maybe it was simply brought to life in an already saturated market

[09:53:12] <sheetjs> pay seems kinda low
[09:53:22] <kalen> theskillwithin, obviously svelte benefitted from the knowledge of frameworks that came before it. i'm simply saying that *if* (somehow) svelte magically existed before react, then i believe it would've overshadowed react and gotten more traction, especially back then before everyone was used to the "react way" of doing things. to me, it's just basic common sense because svelte is much simpler on the surface and more in line with traditional web

[09:53:57] <theskillwithin> kalen i guess we will never know
[09:55:08] <theskillwithin> KevinX https://www.plex.tv/about/careers/
[09:56:01] <kalen> well, if svelte goes on to surpass react in the coming years, i think we would know. because if it can beat it TODAY, with all the usage/marketing benefits it enjoys, then it obviously would've beaten it back then when react was a newcomer with none of those benefits
[09:56:12] <KevinX> im a customer there. i feel they are trying to push their junk service on me theskillwithin

[15:00:42] *** Joins: wyclif (~wyclif@user/wyclif)
[15:00:57] <ProfSimm> Maxdamantus: everything's a value, and if you do "x: some value, y: x" then y has an implicit copy of x, not a reference to it
[15:01:32] <ProfSimm> Maxdamantus: that's very useful in avoiding "surprise change at distance" (shared mutable state) and matches network messaging semantics i.e. you pass messages by copy not by reference
[15:01:38] <Maxdamantus> Sure, so then if you modify something in `x`, you're changing what value is stored in `x`.
[15:01:52] <ProfSimm> Maxdamantus: yes
[15:02:01] <Maxdamantus> Like in C, where you can have a struct value stored in a variable, then `x.y++;` will modify `x`.

[19:42:01] <banana_> what do the subcontracting agents tell you? sometimes they give you the low down why youre not being hired, because they're motivated to get you hired  by the clients so they make commission
[19:42:04] <kek_> prometh, what?

[19:43:55] <prometh> banana_: yes, i've gone through that too
[19:44:17] <peteyboy1> prometh, I assumed you only applied to senior positions, in which case even going for mid positions should be easy enough for you
[19:44:59] <banana_> what have they told you? idk in my experience they'll at least say "Dude, yeah... you didnt do well enough on their tech questions. Also you said something wrong in the interview questions" or something because they probe the client hard why you werent chosen
[19:45:09] <peteyboy1> Developers with experience who "can't get a job" really don't have the same problem as people of most other professions who "can't get a job".
[19:45:32] <prometh> peteyboy1: i never find mid positions
[19:46:01] <peteyboy1> prometh, Nevermind, junior positions nowadays ask for 3 years of experience, so maybe that's why

[21:46:01] <FlorianBad> hmm, well, in my case     some_var = obj.something - obj.somethingElse     and they start unset (non existent) so maybe that's not ultra clean to rely on this?
[21:46:51] <FlorianBad> or one of them might be unset, which in theory should result in NaN because of the   -    operator

[21:50:36] <blueagain> that looks fine to me, but adding guards will make sure that if you ever change how you calculate scroll_diff, the parts relying on it being a number still work

[22:45:52] <corwin> yes, there I think we agree.  where we might not agree is that, in practice, I find those behaviours shift the focus from the human reader of code (who usually needs some help to understand the authors intention) to some specific artifice (which doesn't care about intent so much as convention).
[22:47:19] *** Joins: wyclif (~wyclif@user/wyclif)
[22:50:29] <sheetjs> agreed on the latter point (which is why comments exist in the first place).  the real disagreement is over the nature of the divergence.  "the tooling should be disregarded when it detracts from readability" vs "the tooling theoretically can encourage readable code"
