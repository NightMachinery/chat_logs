[00:03:00] <branch14> I guess I always used the project Id, when using Gitlab's API. I didn't know of the handy option to use the urlencoded path. TIL.
[00:03:47] <chasecaleb> I think it might be a newer feature, because I hadn't seen it in the past either.

[17:45:01] <chasecaleb> hey munen, it dawned on me this morning (pun intended) that anyone affected by the gitlab bug will need to clear local storage to recover. do you think I should make a PR to detect and fix that automatically?
[17:46:18] <chasecaleb> if I remember correctly, we can tell by checking localStorage. If authenticatedSyncService is null but oauth data is set then they're in a broken state, so we could auto-clear storage in that scenario.
[19:01:58] <munen> Hey chasecaleb, nice punüòÑ. I was thinking the same thing. However, I haven't made any big announcements on the feature and there's few connections showing in the GitLab app so far. I think they could just be the three of us logging in and out again. branch14 and I have cleared our localStorages in the meantime to continue testing this nice feature. And so far, so good(;
[19:03:36] <munen> I'd say it's reasonable that an early adopter who found out about this new feature by herself in the short time it was buggy is likely to send us a support request or see the changelog entry in a different browser or on Github with the bugfix.
[19:05:33] <munen> I wouldn't spend extra time on it. If you really want to do it, I'm happy to pull the change in, of course. But there's likely better ways to spend your time. If we had announced the feature or there would have been a longer time period, then it would be different. We had this a few times in the past where a feature looked solid in testing, but then in production it was different where we had to do a migration (those are in src/migrations/index.js).
[19:06:04] <munen> In any case, it is much appreciated that you're thinking about the affected users and are offering to spend even more time on the fix! üôá üôè
[19:09:32] <chasecaleb> munen I agree that makes sense, and if a bunch of users had stumbled on the GitLab feature we would probably have heard from them by now since the token expiration is 2 hours
[19:10:00] <chasecaleb> besides, users generally don't subscribe to issue/PR activity :)
[19:10:26] <chasecaleb> where do you do feature announcements btw? since it seems like this IRC channel is more of a dev hangout than general users.
[19:10:36] <munen> I think so, too. They don't subscribe a lot to issue/PR activity. But organice does show a gift basket icon on the top right if there's news in the changelog(;
[19:11:03] <munen> Yes, the IRC channel is quite empty since the Freenode issue...
[19:11:28] <munen> There's more users in the Matrix channel. Before the Freenode split, both channels were bridged, but this had other problems, so now the channels are separated, again.
[19:12:41] <chasecaleb> ah yes. poor freenode.
[19:13:16] <munen> Announcements are not really formalized at this point. They can be at any of these spots depending on how big the feature is and how much spare time I have to do 'marketing'.... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/f2b4d33ad83e63ff873682b5e7a330cae3d98493)
[19:14:11] <munen> Yes, the Freenode issue was quite bad. I've been a user for a long time. On the other hand, it turned out to be an easy decision - our #organice channel was taken over and my user account was deleted. So it wasn't that hard to figure out on which side of the coin I want to re-create a new IRC chanel.
[19:17:21] <munen> Ah, and EmacsConf would always be a good option to show new features, too. We did host one of the satellites in 2019: https://200ok.ch/posts/2019-11-10_impressions_from_emacsconf_2019.html
[19:19:46] <munen> The organisor asked me if I wanted to do a talk this year, and there would be plenty to speak about (for example the whole multi file feature set and offline capability. not to speak of new back-ends like GitLab^^). But since there's a lot of effort currently going into other community projects (Lambda Zen Temple https://zen-temple.net), I didn't sign up for it this year.
[19:21:25] <chasecaleb> Ooh, nice job on the EmacsConf satellite!
[19:21:58] <munen> Thanks, it was a great event. We even had tarius of magit fame there (he's also Swiss and good fun, too^^).
[19:22:09] <munen> s/tarius/tarsius
[19:23:03] <munen> Making more videos about organice on Youtube would also be a good idea. The intro video from two years ago already has 12k views: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQKc0hcFXCk
[19:23:05] <chasecaleb> Hmph. Yet another reason to be jealous of Sweden as an American.
[19:23:16] <munen> The more I think, the more answers come to the questions "where do you do announcements"(;
[19:23:46] <munen> Sweden is nice, too. But we're in Switzerland^^
[19:25:02] <chasecaleb> Oops. It's still morning over here in my defense ü§¶
[19:25:33] <munen> hihi, no worries^^
[19:26:07] <munen> Compared to the size of the States, the geographic distance between Sweden and Switzerland is negligible(;
[19:27:22] <chasecaleb> Very true
