[07:02:53] <tammy> Ssituation: my crypto trades come in .xlsx format and I'd like to pump them into my own database in the easiest way possible. Ideally by just fetching the daily history and dropping that file into a folder. Then anything in that folder get's uploaded nightly into the database. Any better ideas?
[07:05:04] <tammy> Problem: files are exported from the site in .xlsx format. I can't easily cat or use bash to manipulate them cleanly, so first I need to convert them to .cvs I guess. I 99% expect to never see a comma in the file data fields so this should be safe to do. can anyone recommend a clean xlsx to csv file converter?

[07:33:13] <tammy> am still learning and figuring things out
[07:33:28] <tammy> any by that I mean learning from the experience of making a few dumb choices.
[07:34:10] <tammy> YTD I'm down a grand or 2, but you don't lose it till you sell, and I've not sold those 2 bad trades.
[07:34:28] <tammy> This is all money I can yeet anyways so it's whatever
[07:34:41] <sarnold> does canada have a 'wash sale' rule?
[07:34:48] <tammy> what's that mean>?
[07:34:51] <sarnold> I wonder if those losses might come in handy anyway, heh
[07:35:06] <sarnold> if you lose money on investments, you can deduct some of the loss on your taxes for who knows what reason
[07:35:19] <tammy> if you're under then your gains don't get taxed if they are less than the loss?
[07:35:42] <sarnold> buuuut if you turn around and buy similar investments within sixty days or something like that, then the whole loss is no longer eligible for the deduction, 'wash sale rule'
[07:36:19] <tammy> from what I read, which is introductory at best still, you are only taxed on gains. what I don't know is if that is per transaction or end of year....
[07:36:27] <sarnold> it happened to me once, years ago, so actually selling investments has been something I've mostly avoided :) heh
[07:36:58] <tammy> cause that's going to be tough for me to decide if it's transactional. I place many bids on dips sometimes to bail myself out.
[07:37:40] <Selavi> transactional. called a tax lot
