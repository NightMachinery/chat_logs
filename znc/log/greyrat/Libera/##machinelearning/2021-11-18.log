[00:49:08] <tkr> AbleBacon: If tensorflow is all based on C++, then the most complete way to utilize it would be via the C++ interface. I'm not sure what "it sounds like" means in your context, but I would assume that the Python API is just more wirespread because programming Python is easier than C++ (and thus has more code written by others). Also, using the Python API (I guess) it will take care of the most 
[00:49:14] <tkr> data-wrangling (for example, uint8 vs int8, uint32 vs float) and the memory management (no need to manually release the memory reserved for your ML model in Python).

[00:54:07] <AbleBacon> well, most of the examples are all python
[00:54:16] <AbleBacon> and in fact the build instructions for C++ require python as well
[00:54:58] *** Quits: TheCoffeMaker (~TheCoffeM@user/thecoffemaker) (Excess Flood)
[00:54:58] <AbleBacon> i'm hoping the C++ interface will be all i need, since the rest of my program has to be in C++ as well
[00:57:04] *** Joins: TheCoffeMaker (~TheCoffeM@user/thecoffemaker)
[00:57:14] <tkr> Don't worry about the build instructions. Python is probably used to run some installation scripts, collecting package dependencies etc.
[00:58:38] <tkr> Only reason you should be hoping to use the C++ interface is that you are MUCH MORE capable in C++ than Python. (I'm not saying that you shouldn't use any other abstractions than Python).
[01:06:29] <tkr> Of course you can/will (assuming Tensorflow has a C++ backend) be more efficient with using C++ API directly. I don't know how the general C++ API handles stuff like calling the C++ vs CUDA API, but I would assume (hope) it's seamless by now! :)
[01:08:33] <tkr> .. so in essence, it might take more time after all! Following the advice by Knuth (https://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureOptimization) start out by using the most simple solution that you are able to develop in - and only after encountering performance problems, switch a more performant system!

[22:34:05] <cakeroll> hey. i'm trying to compare two instances of the same model (gpt2) trained on two different data sets (say, text from different authors). one of the datasets, however, is an order of magnitude larger (~20m) than the other (~2m). so now i'm wondering: should i downsample the larger one to make them more comparable? it makes sense to me, but on the
[22:34:06] <cakeroll> other hand, using more data should result in a model with better representations, so i should use as much as possible, even if it's imbalanced. any tips? maybe someone even knows work that looks into this?
