[04:55:42] <audiocat> FunkyBob, how can, when the user visits a page, have the user's browser download an html file (instead of loading some html page)? don't ask why please. i can't find the write words to search on google
[04:55:54] <audiocat> right*
[04:56:16] <FunkyBob> you want clicking a link to download? or landing on the link?

[05:02:30] <dheerajchand> Hi! It's been a long time since I've been on Django IRC, back since the Freenode days!
[05:02:42] <dheerajchand> Is my old friend FunkyBob around?
[05:02:49] <audiocat> dheerajchand, hey. freenode days were not so long ago haha
[05:02:58] <audiocat> dheerajchand, yes he should respond in a few...seconds
[05:03:04] <audiocat> he just helped me like 2 minutes ago
[05:03:08] <dheerajchand> That's so cool!
[05:03:36] <audiocat> er, 3 mins ago
[05:03:39] <audiocat> he may be busy though
[05:03:45] <dheerajchand> It seems like a long time ago, I guess, because I haven't been around since my kid was born, and that makes time seem much longer.
[05:03:52] <audiocat> dheerajchand, go ahead and ask your question
[05:04:07] <dheerajchand> Oh, I don't have a question, I was just popping in to say hi!
[05:04:08] <audiocat> dheerajchand, oh, well congratulations
[05:04:11] <audiocat> oh cool
[05:05:39] <dheerajchand> I mean, I sort of have a question, but not really. I have a spaghetti code application running on local Docker containers that I want to make into a Django application, it consists of importing CSV's and then running PSQL queries on them.  I'm sure that there are good ways to do things to make this better, like using queuing tools, etc. but I don't really know those.

[09:26:29] <FunkyBob> that seems... entirely unrelated to your question
[09:26:41] <FunkyBob> but glad you have a solution
[09:26:44] <dre> lol
[09:27:10] <dre> FunkyBob, you must learn the ways of gibberish.
[09:27:10] <freiza_> FunkyBob, yes, But that time, I didn't know how to describe my problem. I am new to all these.
[09:27:19] <FunkyBob> freiza_: it happens a lot
[09:27:43] <FunkyBob> it's best to start with a general "I want to do X" overview, then get into the details of your current solution
[09:28:08] <FunkyBob> dre: I've far too much experience... hence my tired old macro : "Tell me the problem you want to solve, not the solution you want to fix."
[09:28:23] <FunkyBob> dre: so... what should I make for dinner on this hot evening?
[09:28:30] <dre> :P ye
[09:28:49] <dre> hm, dunno, depends what you've got.. I've been making enchiladas a lot recently.
[09:29:00] <FunkyBob> ooh, nice
[09:29:15] <FunkyBob> wonder if I could whip up some nice quesadilla
[09:29:33] <dre> mexican spice mixed with chicken and diced vegetables, chuck it in those mission spinach wraps, cover with chunky salsa and layer of cheese then oven / grill to melt.
[09:29:54] <dre> also legit.
[09:30:02] <dre> I've got to make dinner soon, no idea what to make
[09:30:41] <dre> learnt out to make quiche the other day, but it's just not a meal to me. I look at it like a savoury cake
[09:30:49] <FunkyBob> https://blog.tinbrain.net/recipes/index.html
[09:31:01] <FunkyBob> my daughter sometimes pesters me to make quiche

[09:32:47] <dre> FunkyBob, you reminded me, PM'd
[09:39:12] <dre> also FunkyBob you should help me with my general django forum 'app' https://github.com/Dotrar/Kookaburra ( which will be a part of my CMS site "Illabunda" )
[09:39:21] <dre> initial commit - original code do not steal
[09:39:22] <dre> :P
[09:39:26] <FunkyBob> :P
[09:39:58] <FunkyBob> ah, my two weaknesses!  wanting a good forum in django, and wanting to build my CMS dream :P
[09:42:04] <dre> I saw a nice preso the other day on how to write good reusable apps, and it was along the line of "apps must be tightly scoped" and I've been spending all day trying to figure out what the scope of the app actually is. I suppose it should try to be as stand-alone-forum as possible but easily integrated into a larger site if necessary

[15:52:59] <theprophet> GinFuyou and i tought timezone.now was somehow reffered to DateTimeField.
[15:53:20] <theprophet> GinFuyou and the question was born.
[15:54:08] <GinFuyou> mmm, not quite seeing it. timezone.now() creates a datetime object, which DateTimeField stores at DB level
[15:54:26] <theprophet> ok i am Guessiong to my question answer is NO GinFuyou so every class needs its own DateTimefield since its always different table?
[15:54:53] <GinFuyou> Or use a an abstract model inheritance
[15:55:09] <GinFuyou> Then it should be declared in base abstract model
[15:55:22] <theprophet> GinFuyou aha i see
[15:55:42] <GinFuyou> Real models inheriting from it will get it by default, as in "usual" python inheritance
[15:56:14] <theprophet> GinFuyou whats the best practice there? to seperate or inherit?
[15:57:26] <GinFuyou> For given example there is no general difference. If you want pub_datetime on many model, surely it's less code to use abstract inheritance
[15:58:00] <theprophet> GinFuyou got it , thank you.
[15:58:41] <GinFuyou> Also check docs on difference between abstract and multi-table inheritance since it's django specifics
[15:59:03] <theprophet> GinFuyou will do that.
[15:59:16] <GinFuyou> In short version: you most always want abstract inheritance, unless you are sure otherwise.
[15:59:39] <theprophet> got it
[16:00:49] <theprophet> GinFuyou what is the point of date=timezone.now() in that case then?

[18:20:52] <pycode> GinFuyou, yes exactly i am going to create that field in __init__
[18:20:57] <pycode> but the problem is that i do not know the number
[18:21:01] <pycode> how can i pass it?
[18:21:12] <pycode> i need to read the size somewhere

[18:21:42] <GinFuyou> well, you could read it from raw POST data
[18:22:06] <GinFuyou> That doesn't sound pretty but might work
[18:22:44] <pycode> it is not a stupid solution :D
[18:22:52] <pycode> yes i can do something like that
[18:23:00] <pycode> maybe add a special input
[18:23:03] <pycode> with the lenght
[18:23:08] <pycode> length
[18:23:40] <GinFuyou> yes
[18:23:51] <GinFuyou> could handle it in init as well
[18:24:21] <GinFuyou> I haven't tried adding fields in init though, not sure if it just works
[18:24:29] <pycode> yes i can read the self.data of the form and then inside the init usig self.fields['']
[18:24:33] <pycode> right ?
[18:24:35] <pycode> ok
[18:25:34] <GinFuyou> well, on init it's just data
[18:25:57] <GinFuyou> if you haven't called super().__init__() at least I think
[18:26:04] <pycode> to create the fields i usually do features = SplitArrayField(forms.CharField(max_length=128), size=3)
[18:26:13] <pycode> but as i wrote you i need to dinamically change the size
[18:26:18] <pycode> so i think before calling super()
[18:26:41] <pycode> no wait before super() i do not have self.fields
[18:26:46] <pycode> i must do it AFTER super()

[20:55:37] <dminuoso> Hi. Im trying to run django-admin, which is merely hidden behind some indirection of shell scripts. Most commands work just fine, but the `runserver` is subtly broken - does someone have an idea what's going on here?
[20:55:39] <dminuoso> https://gist.github.com/dminuoso/1b4be52535d62f96dca8f3839054f000
[20:57:30] <dminuoso> I'm really unsure what's happening, it almost seems like this is doing something akin to this (pseudocode) execfile(${which django-admin.py})
[20:57:36] <dminuoso> But this only occurs on runserver, all other commands work just fine
[21:04:45] <GinFuyou> Why are you using runserver through django-admin?
[21:06:04] <dminuoso> No reason in particular, I was just testing whether my django-admin wrapper was working, and I thought "why not try runserver too"
[21:06:09] <GinFuyou> Not sure what is the problem at hand but it shouldn't work anyway without specifying settings module, as far as I understand ut
[21:06:21] <dminuoso> GinFuyou: All environment variables are properly configured.
[21:06:55] <GinFuyou> well, I don't see that
[21:07:42] <dminuoso> The balance of trying not to show too much. Sorry for the inconvenience
[21:08:19] <dminuoso> It's already set in my shell environment when I run these commands
[21:09:21] <dminuoso> collectstatic, findstatic and inspectdb work just fine so far
[21:10:13] <dminuoso> Or `dbshell`, `shell`. All of them work just fine
[21:11:03] <dminuoso> `migrate` has some weird behavior to it, giving me an `KeyError: 'choices'` exception
[21:11:23] <dminuoso> But at least I get some sensible stack trace that I can debug and fix that

[21:18:58] <knbk> well, runserver spawns a subprocess, it probably using sys.argv[0] to determine which executable to call. Usually that would be python, but your wrapper overwrites it
