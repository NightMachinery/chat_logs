[01:34:27] <gwern> and the smaller ones add basically nothing on top of the largest?
[01:34:34] <RiversHaveWings> i haven't tried it as much
[01:34:42] <RiversHaveWings> The ViT+RN combo is particularly good.
[01:35:08] <RiversHaveWings> But there are a ton of people on EAI #art who basically just stack all the CLIP models they have GPU memory for.
[01:35:15] <gwern> I'd expect ensembling the sizes to be unhelpful but different archs/datasets to be much more helpful. so ruCLIP might be helpful since it's trained on a rather different dataset - not just images, but language too

[01:37:24] <gwern> RiversHaveWings: well reember the clip paper said they were originally training with a autoregressive objective. it's just that it was slow and expensive, so they switched to a contrastive loss on an entire text input
[01:37:48] <RiversHaveWings> gwern: yeah, a weird hopfield thing (self- and cross-attention along the batch dimension on raw embeddings, no learned projections) + a modified non-saturating contrastive objective (negative mean log odds instead of negative mean log likelihood)
[01:37:55] <RiversHaveWings> oh
[01:37:56] <gwern> (so I believe yeah, it would be a caption decoding based on an imae embedding input)
[01:38:19] <RiversHaveWings> Yeah that could be interesting
[01:38:57] <RiversHaveWings> It's the most direct, straightforward way to do captioning
[01:39:10] <RiversHaveWings> Well, I guess cross-attention would be actually.
[01:39:17] <gwern> a lot of shiny toys to play with if you can wrangle the compute. DM is enamored of Perceiver of course because that's so crazy general and flexible

[02:04:33] <kuudes> but yes, real losses would be expected. but not losing the battle
[02:04:47] <kuudes> nato people would die as well, if russians shoot back
[02:04:51] <quanticle> Right, and then what happens if Putin decides to escalate?
[02:05:09] <kuudes> how?
[02:05:25] <quanticle> A tactical nuclear strike, perhaps against a lightly manned NATO airbase
[02:05:33] <kuudes> same the other way
[02:05:53] <quanticle> Uh huh, and now you've started on the nuclear escalation ladder. I'm *glad* you're not in charge of anything
[02:06:24] <kuudes> no, putin started it. and he does not have to do it
[02:06:35] <kuudes> if he nukes berlin, france can nuke moscow.
[02:06:43] <kuudes> france has enough nukes for destroying russia.
[02:07:24] <kuudes> uk has as well
[02:09:24] <kuudes> usa nor uk will not die if russia drives tanks to lisbon. but france and germany will.
[02:09:36] <Betawolf> so, we can (a) sanction Russia for aggression towards a non-allied nation within its traditional sphere of influence or (b) kill approximately all the Russians
[02:09:46] <kuudes> no
[02:09:55] <kuudes> we can put a no fly zone there
[02:10:03] <kuudes> it is outside russia
[02:10:21] <kuudes> will russian planes fly through radar locks?
[02:10:57] <quanticle> Russia isn't driving tanks to Lisbon
[02:11:03] <kuudes> isn't it?
[02:11:07] <quanticle> No
[02:11:10] <kuudes> where it will stop?
[02:11:14] <quanticle> Kiev
[02:11:20] <quanticle> Possibly Lviv
[02:11:23] <kuudes> it already is west of kiev
[02:11:29] <quanticle> Source?
[02:11:37] <kuudes> troops in chernobyl
[02:12:03] <kuudes> chernobyl area is west of kiev and west of dnepr
[02:12:05] <quanticle> Yes, which are moving towards Kiev
[02:12:33] <kuudes> why do you feel russia will not donbas baltics?
[02:13:06] <quanticle> Because he hasn't spent six months building up 80% of his army on their borders
[02:13:27] <kuudes> yet
[02:13:29] <quanticle> He hasn't talked about how they've been oppressing their Russian minorities for the past 8 years

[02:14:48] <Betawolf> Assuming they capture it, Russia will be working hard to hold Ukraine for several years, not to mention the economic pressure. If you're worried about Russia invading places, them having picked one place to invade should assure you they'll be busy.
[02:16:20] <quanticle> Like, the nightmare scenarios talk about a Russian surprise attack, where Russia uses troops in its Western military district to rapidly drive to Talinn, in a matter of 50-60 hours. But that's not what happened here. Russia didn't launch a surprise attack into Ukraine, they conducted a months long build-up in the open. If they did that on the border of Poland, or the Baltics, there would be
[02:16:22] <quanticle> plenty of time for the US, UK, France, etc, to move their troops forward as well.
[02:18:20] <gwern> (it still boggles my mind that cheetahs can apparently hit 60mph, and quarter horses 55mph)
[02:20:03] <kuudes> it seems to me a lot depends on how long ukraine can stall. the longer it can, the better stuff gets to it
[02:20:27] <kuudes> and the easier it is for west to justify coming to its aid
[02:20:43] <kuudes> because the price for that gets lower over time as well, as that shows russia has more shitty army
[02:22:42] <quanticle> Yes, and that's an important lesson for Taiwan as well
[02:22:49] <quanticle> (Hopefully they learn it)
[02:22:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Interestingly, Estonia and Latvia have a higher population percentage of ethnic Russians than Ukraine
[02:23:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not Lithuania though! Interestingly enough
[02:24:10] <kuudes> yes
[02:24:30] <kuudes> and they are actually persecuted to some extent there

[02:25:07] <kuudes> russia has about 1500
[02:25:22] <kuudes> if germany aircraft is at least 6:1 then they are even with russia
[02:26:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Did you miss where quanticle explained that most of the German air force is not actually combat-ready
[02:27:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> It would be very optimistic to assume that Germany could match even a third of Russia's air force effectiveness-wise
[02:27:34] <kuudes> france has 203

[02:30:30] <quanticle> That's meaningless. The F-18 is a great plane, don't get me wrong, but it's still a 4th gen fighter and Russia has plenty of planes that would have comparable performance characteristics. If you look at them, the F-18C and the MiG-29 are very similar planes, and I somehow doubt that either of them would hold a 10:1 advantage against something like a Su-35.
[02:30:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wait a minute, Finland doesn't even have 64 F-35s
[02:30:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Finland has 64 F-35s *on order*
[02:30:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> lol
[02:31:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> They won't be in service until 2026!
[02:31:26] <kuudes> they have 103 su-35s

[02:32:12] <quanticle> Alternative take: Yes, buy canned food and blankets immediately. Duct tape yourself in your apartment and don't come out until random IRC people tell you that it's safe
[02:32:51] <saturn2> it's the closest we've been since the cold war, but still not very likely
[02:32:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> And toilet paper! Don't forget paper products

[02:34:21] <grandrew> accepting that as a possibility is a good measure to not let that happen
[02:34:23] <quanticle> And besides, you're just factually wrong. The level of stress that we have right now is nowhere close where we were during World War 2.
[02:34:53] <quanticle> Like, we're at Arab-Israeli conflict levels of stress right now
[02:34:57] <Betawolf> to be fair, the men in the trenches didn't have to suffer Tiktok
[02:35:07] <grandrew> although I don't know of any other way we invented to equalize the world after WWII the inequaity was only growing.. again
[02:35:11] <kuudes> it is indeed cozy in usa

[02:42:01] <kuudes> didn't gwern link a thing re it recently?
[02:42:05] <rmmh> > the USSR massively overinvested in neon capacity in the 1980's, in order to build space-based excimer laser weapons. Ukraine's extant plants date (probably) to the 1980's; they're responsible for a global oversupply that's persisted since the Cold War.

[02:50:12] <Betawolf> It's not clear what air engagements there have been, right? One Ukranian plane was definitely shot down, and they claimed some Russian hits.

[02:52:51] <CoJaBo> The early reports seemed to be that Russia thought they'd have the capital by nightfall local time, which seems off-track. So there's that at least
[02:52:56] <CoJaBo> The co I work for has completely cut ties with Russia, and no longer allows any Russian purchase or use of our services. This.. may be a slightly pointless gesture, as we don't offer anything in the Russian language and have never had any customers or vendors there <_<
[02:53:28] <kuudes> the co I work for has 2000 employees in ukraine :-/
[02:54:18] <quanticle> The Russians tried. They tried to take an airport outside Kiev with heliborne infantry, with an eye to using it as a staging area for a lightning attack on central Kiev, but the Ukrainians repelled the attack
[02:54:36] <kuudes> yes
[02:55:24] <quanticle> Okay this is a slightly more realistic, and therefore terrifying, scenario: https://twitter.com/IdeanSalehyan/status/1496974507495542796
[02:55:25] <Robomot> Idean Salehyan (@IdeanSalehyan): "Could NATO become involved in Ukraine? One scenario: / 1) A long insurgency is likely. / 2) Poland, Hungary, or other neighboring NATO countries may allow resistance forces access to their territory. / 3) Russia attacks rebel forces in NATO countries. / 4) Article 5 is invoked."
[02:55:50] <kuudes> poland seems to be keen on going to fight in ukraine
[02:56:24] <kuudes> but best would be if someone stauffenberg putin
[02:56:37] <quanticle> Like, if the Poles or Hungarians try to become a safe haven for Ukrainian insurgents, then I can see Russia trying a "limited incursion" to take out insurgent training camps.
[02:56:57] <quanticle> And they may do this without necessarily consulting with the rest of NATO
[02:57:21] <kuudes> turkey shot down that russian plane in syria back then
[02:58:14] <quanticle> Yeah, but then Russia and Syria made up afterwards. And Russian ground troops never crossed the border into Turkey (mainly because Russia didn't have any ground troops in the area).
[02:58:36] <kuudes> did russia do anything at all against turkey? iirc not
[02:59:08] <kuudes> also usa bombed that lot of russian paid soldiers in syria
[02:59:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Article 5 has only been invoked once, ever, so while this is indeed slightly more realistic, I don't know that it's much more than that
[02:59:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> It really does not seem like the U.S. is interested in involving itself in this
[02:59:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> But who knows, I guess
[02:59:51] <quanticle> Well, if uniformed Russian soldiers cross the border into Poland, and Poland says, "Hey, this is justification for Article 5," who's going to tell them no?
[03:00:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> These days we don't exactly have what you'd call a coherent foreign policy

[03:01:00] <quanticle> I don't know about that. I think we would say yes, because, if we said no, like, what the fuck did we set up NATO for?
[03:01:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't mean that we'd say "we refuse to uphold the treaty"
[03:01:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean we'd say "don't invoke Article 5"
[03:01:32] <quanticle> Oh, yeah, probably
[03:01:57] <quanticle> But if the Poles did it anyway, I don't think we'd have much of a choice
[03:02:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, true, but they'd have to be pretty darn spooked to do it
[03:02:21] <quanticle> It'd be like the Melians calling Sparta out for not honoring their treaty of mutual defense against Athens
[03:03:00] * gwern has read a decent bit about melos and would still have to look that up. nothing as complex as internecine greek or italian city-state warfare
[03:04:08] <quanticle> IIRC the Pelponnesian war started because the Melians called Sparta out for being reluctant to field troops to support them against Athens. They called the Spartans cowards and their treaties worthless, so Sparta, reluctantly at first, mounted a military expedition against Athens.
[03:05:13] <saturn2> can NATO kick out a member?
[03:05:24] <kuudes> I don't recall such
[03:05:25] <quanticle> We'd have to kick out quite a few members

[03:07:36] <quanticle> Betawolf: Well, NATO specifies that the alliance is specifically *defensive* in nature. The drafters of the North Atlantic Treaty weren't complete idiots; they still remembered the dangers of the blank check treaties that led to the start of World War 1.
[03:08:10] <Betawolf> right, but the idea that you're meant to defend _your current enemies_ from attack would still seem rather doubtful
[03:08:57] <quanticle> Wait, I don't understand. How would NATO encompass our enemies?
[03:09:13] <kuudes> quanticle, Betawolf is speculating canada attacking usa or something
[03:09:17] <quanticle> Oh
[03:09:20] <kuudes> and then demanding usa defends them from usa
[03:09:48] <kuudes> set containing itself etc
[03:09:50] <Betawolf> I'm talking about grounds for kicking someone out of NATO, war seems like one such.
[03:09:51] <quanticle> Right. NATO just covers attacks from non-NATO countries and organizations (such as Al Qaeda)
[03:10:12] <kuudes> iirc nato rules weren't very long
[03:10:34] <gurkenglas> if everyone's in NATO, no one is?
[03:10:35] <quanticle> Like kuudes points out, the Turks and the Greeks did shoot at each other when they were both part of NATO. The Turks came close to shooting at the US when we both had troops deployed in Syria, supporting opposing sides.

[03:16:05] <Betawolf> There's no stated mechanism for expelling a party, but it would seem like the council would be able to do so if a party was considered in breach and the political will was there.
[03:18:28] <kuudes> well, expulsion wouldn't strictly be necessary? it is not needed for common defence
[03:18:48] <kuudes> you can defend until the attacking state is repelled and then stop

[09:19:54] <nshepperd2> it was a heady time, when you could write a popular ML paper just by inventing a new variant of linear regression
[09:20:55] <quanticle> "Despite previous testing demonstrating the strength and durability of the harness, devices were removed within minutes to hours of initial fitting. Notably, removal was observed to involve one bird snapping another bird’s harness at the only weak point, such that the tracker was released. This behaviour demonstrates both cooperation and a moderate level of problem solving, providing potential
[09:20:57] <quanticle> further evidence of the cognitive abilities of this species. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report the conspecific removal of GPS trackers, and should be considered when planning future tracking studies especially on highly social species."

[10:14:55] <Ralith> 2kW of motor is pretty serious business on a lightweight vehicle like a scooter
[10:15:08] <Ralith> my souped up bicycle is in that neighborhood, albeit with gearing
[10:25:42] <quanticle> Yeah, they're claiming a *forty mile per hour* top speed
[10:25:51] <PapuaHardyNet> okay so we use the kernel trick to map inputs to a higher dimension and then reduce the computational cost of working with the higher dimension mapping
[10:25:59] <quanticle> Like, okay, but who would be insane enough to go even half that speed on a fucking scooter
[10:26:37] <quanticle> Jesus can you imagine hitting a pothole with that thing? At 40mph
[10:26:56] <PapuaHardyNet> next, we use random fourier features to approximate the kernel function used in the kernel trick to reduce the computational cost even more

[10:41:05] <PapuaHardyNet> there are special codepoints for SUPERSCIRPT LATIN SMALL LETTER, but only for 'i' and 'n'
[10:46:18] <feep[work]> quanticle: see, the thing is
[10:46:24] <feep[work]> all these scooters just seem ludicrously overpriced to me
[10:47:03] <feep[work]> especi... > 9.1-inch-wide deck provides enough room for your feet to stand side by side.
[10:47:13] <feep[work]> no! you don't drive a scooter with your feet side by side! bad! bad manufacturer!
[10:47:39] <feep[work]> also what the fuck, 60 km/h top speed
[10:47:46] <feep[work]> that's ludicrous
[10:47:56] <feep[work]> what, you gonna drive that thing on a highway
[10:48:24] <feep[work]> like, I've often complained about restrictive german escooter laws, in my wildest dreams I imagine politicians ... raising the speedlimit for scooters to 30
[10:48:36] <feep[work]> 60 is just insane, especially given all the scaling laws about injury risk
[10:48:40] <quanticle> 60 km/h isn't highway speed. At least, not on any American highway.
[10:48:49] <feep[work]> well it's not sidewalk speed, that's for sure :V
[10:48:53] <quanticle> Oh yeah
[10:49:06] <feep[work]> it's also not city road speed
[10:49:12] <feep[work]> residential*
[10:49:25] <feep[work]> so idk what sort of target group they're envisioning there
[10:49:45] <quanticle> Yeah, I really have no idea. Like, who would buy one of these and not an ebike?
[10:49:49] <feep[work]> yeah
[10:49:54] <saturn2> maybe that power is meant for going up hills rather than going that fast on level ground
[10:50:14] <feep[work]> it's meant for going that fast on level ground. they advertise it as such specifically.
[10:50:48] <feep[work]> for comparison, my scooter was like $500
[10:51:37] <feep[work]> and ... hang on, how do they advertise this as up to 40 miles
[10:52:23] <feep[work]> 64km.. mine advertises at 33km and has a battery that's bit more than half as big ... okay, could work out but sounds like they're being optimistic to the tune of 10-20% or so
[10:52:31] <feep[work]> fair nuf
[10:52:53] <feep[work]> should be noted that that range will crater in winter, and/or if you're heavier than average
[10:53:35] <feep[work]> or going uphill a lot
[10:54:00] <feep[work]> I guess living in sf or something could justify this thing, I notice my 350W frontwheel motor has problems with hills
[10:54:50] <feep[work]> 2kW still seems like ludicrous overkill
[10:55:14] <feep[work]> idk.
[10:55:32] <quanticle> This is the Model S Plaid of scooters
[10:55:37] <feep[work]> anyway, let me make the important point
[10:55:44] <quanticle> That's what I'm deriving from this discussion
[10:55:45] <feep[work]> do not drive your scooter with your feet side by side
[10:55:55] <feep[work]> drive it like a skateboard
[10:56:12] <feep[work]> that will massively improve your ability to catch yourself if the front wheel hits something
[10:56:32] <quanticle> Oh, because you can shift your weight instantly to the back foot
[10:56:54] <feep[work]> yeah and also you can catch the steering bar with your hip, which means you can avoid going over it if it's not like, a total crash
[10:57:30] <feep[work]> if you are riding with feet side by side, you have to catch yourself on your arms, which have terrible leverage.
[10:58:07] <feep[work]> but also if you tip over it you will be falling hip-first
[10:58:11] <feep[work]> not head-first
[10:59:00] <feep[work]> this gets especially important if a certain irresponsible manufacturer sells you a scooter that can go 60 fucking km/h :V :V 
[11:02:21] <quanticle> Yeah, honestly, my cousin in India owns a Vespa scooter. Like, one of these: https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2016/04/featured-image-vespa-70-years-230416.jpg?im=FitAndFill,width=1200,height=900
[11:02:21] <Robomot> image/jpeg (1200x900; 59 KB)
[11:02:36] <quanticle> I'm prettu sure that thing tops out around 60 km/h
[11:03:25] <feep[work]> ^^
[11:03:28] <PapuaHardyNet> nshepperd2: is the O notation of ij, jk -> ik O(ijk) or am I missing something
[11:12:05] <nshepperd2> it is matrix multiplication
[11:12:16] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah it is probably O(ijk) notwithstanding numpy optimizations. einsum looks rather simple: all you are doing is multiplying elements in the j axis for each matrix and then summing over them
[11:12:45] <PapuaHardyNet> so like, ij elements with ik elements? I'm not able to connect what I know about matmul O notation to einsum for some reason
[11:13:07] <PapuaHardyNet> s/jk/
[11:14:11] <PapuaHardyNet> summing doesn't count. only for loops count. There are three for loops even if einsum looks simple
[11:15:19] <PapuaHardyNet> ij elements with jk elements, so there's the `i` and the `k` of the O notation, and then actually multiplying each element is the `j` part of the O notation
[11:16:21] <PapuaHardyNet> sorry, I'm just trying to wrap my head around this because I was estimating the O notation benefits to SVM for adding kernel trick, and then adding random fourier features
[11:16:31] <nshepperd2> output_ik = sum_j {M_ij N_jk}
[11:16:44] <nshepperd2> thats O(ijk) multiplications yeah
[11:17:02] <nshepperd2> or O(n^3) in other words, if the axis are all of length n
[11:18:25] <PapuaHardyNet> uh huh, thanks!

[11:38:52] <ggreer> good luck continuing to exist if putin finds out you're fucking with his country
[11:39:48] <nshepperd> good idea, Google should put polonium in his tea
[11:42:58] <PapuaHardyNet> just going to say, random features is an impressive technique
[11:43:40] <PapuaHardyNet> it removes the dependency of kernel machines on their dataset
[11:44:13] <PapuaHardyNet> So for a linear classifier you go from O(iN) for inference to O(D) where D is the length of the output of the "random feature" map
[11:44:45] <PapuaHardyNet> this benefit gets even more extreme when you use more complicated methods like SVM where the default is O((iN)^2)
[11:45:09] <PapuaHardyNet> goes down to O(D^2), which means that the complexity of inference does not scale with an increase in dataset size
[11:47:27] <PapuaHardyNet> "We’re getting this award for this paper. But this paper was the beginning of a trilogy of sorts. And like all stories worth telling, the good stuff happens in the middle, not at the beginning.

[11:47:27] <Robomot> Reflections on Random Kitchen Sinks – arg min blog (text of the acceptance speech for the NIPS test of time award)
[11:48:34] <PapuaHardyNet> to be honest, what is basically happening here is that you are taking a non-parameterized model and adding more parameters to replace the dataset
[11:48:46] <PapuaHardyNet> s/replace the/replace iterating over the/

[12:04:09] <quanticle> What is i, in this case?
[12:04:20] * feep[work] stares at his hands
[12:04:22] <feep[work]> what is "i"?
[12:04:51] <PapuaHardyNet> quanticle: i is the length of a data point vector
[12:05:01] <PapuaHardyNet> N is the dataset length
[12:05:27] <gurkenglas> but then linear classifier is O(i) inference, right?
[12:05:30] <PapuaHardyNet> oh no, feep, isn't this a weekend?
[12:06:11] <quanticle> It's Friday for feep, I presume
[12:06:34] <PapuaHardyNet> gurkenglas: I think so too. Now I'm confused
[12:07:05] <feep[work]> yep, it's friday
[12:07:17] <feep[work]> morning
[12:08:07] <feep[work]> (friday, friday, merging prs on friday~ everyone's looking forward to the sprint end, sprint end~)
[12:08:31] <PapuaHardyNet> so training a linear classifier (that is, a loss function over the entire dataset) should be O(iN)
[12:08:43] <feep[work]> (wait why the fuck is jenkins failing, fun fun fun fun)
[12:11:18] <PapuaHardyNet> so with lifting, linear classifier inference is O(v) where you use a lifting function that maps Ri->Rv. for a kernel, linear classifier inference is again O(i), which means using a kernel trick does not affect computation but significantly improves performance (due to allowing the use of a lifting function)
[12:11:31] *** Joins: tarquinius (uid533142@user/tarquinius)
[12:12:13] <PapuaHardyNet> So random features is actually useful only for models that use the dataset during inference, like SVM.
[12:13:36] <PapuaHardyNet> well it does benefit training too, so there's that
[12:16:00] <PapuaHardyNet> after all, the "random features" map replaces the *combination of lifting function + kernel trick*, and therefore doesn't necessarily take into account the dataset (well, it does, but that is not part of the *map*, it is how you use the map)

[12:16:30] <gurkenglas> from a little googling kernel tricks sound like free lunch. what precisely is the property of the function to learn that they exploit?
[12:16:55] <PapuaHardyNet> all right, let me try to explain from the beginning
[12:17:11] <PapuaHardyNet> you have a linear classifier (for example) and a dataset that cannot be classified using a linear classifier.
[12:17:41] <PapuaHardyNet> you use a "lifting function" that projects all data points into a higher dimensional space where you can use a linear classifier to create a hyperplane that performs adequately
[12:18:04] <gurkenglas> where do you get the lifting function
[12:18:53] <PapuaHardyNet> idk, I guess people just empirically find out what works? Here's an example of an R2 -> R3 lifting function (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_kernel)
[12:18:53] <Robomot> Polynomial kernel - Wikipedia (In machine learning, the polynomial kernel is a kernel function commonly used with support vector machines (SVMs) and other kernelized models, that represents the similarity of vectors (training samples) in a feature space over polynomials of the original variables, allowing learning of non-linear models.)
[12:20:24] <gurkenglas> this answer enfrowns the gurkenglas
[12:20:48] <PapuaHardyNet> well, specifically, here's an R2 -> R3 lifting function f([x, y]) = W [x, y], where W = [x**2, y**2, sqrt(2) * x * y]
[12:21:00] <PapuaHardyNet> as you can see, it is an arbitrary projection
[12:21:22] <PapuaHardyNet> here you go, you'll figure it out faster if you read this: http://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2019/12/10/kernel-trick/
[12:21:23] <Robomot> Implicit Lifting and the Kernel Trick (Gregory Gundersen is a PhD candidate at Princeton.)
[12:21:27] <gurkenglas> is "projection" different from "function"?
[12:22:13] <PapuaHardyNet> no, I use the terms interchangeably when there's a matrix multiplication of an input that is the only thing happening in the function
[12:22:35] <gurkenglas> i suspect this function is not arbitrary
[12:23:21] <PapuaHardyNet> anyway, back to the kernel function
[12:24:16] <PapuaHardyNet> so you have a kernel function that takes two vectors / data points, and whose output is the same as the inner product in the higher dimensional space that the lifting function projects the two vectors into
[12:25:02] <PapuaHardyNet> every such higher dimensional space has a corresponding kernel function, and every valid kernel function (specifically a positive definitive function) has a corresponding higher dimensional space that conforms to the previous statement
[12:25:13] <PapuaHardyNet> s/definitive/definition/
[12:25:20] <gurkenglas> (i remember getting turned off the signal processing line of courses when i asked why they assume a linear basis and they said ~"because it works")
[12:25:49] <PapuaHardyNet> lmao
[12:27:10] <gurkenglas> in retrospect maybe the resulting evaporative cooling caused the state of confusion in ML which is gonna kill everyone...
[12:27:57] <gurkenglas> should've disbelieved the lecturer, stayed, and shown the lecturer the real answer.
[12:27:59] <quanticle> gurkenglas: So much EE is like that
[12:28:32] <quanticle> "Why do you assume this sinusoidal?" "Because empirically, it's good enough"
[12:29:09] <gurkenglas> right and the update present me prescribes past me about this is "this is a map-territory confusion"
[12:29:35] <gurkenglas> not even everyone's, whoever just told you this just didn't go to learn the answer.
[12:30:03] <quanticle> Alternatively, it's a shortcut that prevents you from getting sucked down rabbit holes
[12:30:21] <PapuaHardyNet> it does, imagine trying to understand AWS lambda
[12:30:33] <gurkenglas> (((are rabbit holes in the territory?)))
[12:30:36] <quanticle> AWS Lambda isn't that difficult to understand
[12:30:50] <PapuaHardyNet> anyway, there's always, always a point where people stop asking recursive "why?" questions
[12:30:57] <gurkenglas> such as
[12:30:57] <PapuaHardyNet> some people just stop earlier.
[12:31:29] <PapuaHardyNet> why aren't there aliens that we have encountered yet? The Fermi Paradox is not an answer, it is a question
[12:31:39] <gurkenglas> "dissolving the fermi paradox"
[12:31:45] <quanticle> Anyway, speaking of which, that article you linked on having to understand everything... you know what broke me out of that habit?
[12:31:47] <quanticle> Scheme
[12:31:49] <gurkenglas> it's a statistical math error.
[12:32:22] <PapuaHardyNet> now I want both of you to continue
[12:32:39] <quanticle> Because, when you're writing Scheme, at some point, you have to stop worrying about the precise how of e.g. filesystem access, or dealing with the network. If you do, you'll never get any code written.
[12:33:08] <quanticle> You just have to say, "Okay, this is an abstraction that the interpreter provides, it follows a certain specification, and I'm going to have to trust my runtime."
[12:33:51] <quanticle> That was so hard for me
[12:34:05] <quanticle> Because when I started writing Scheme, my only other programming experience had been in C
[12:34:23] <PapuaHardyNet> hahahah yeah I feel you
[12:35:03] <quanticle> And with C, first of all, it's pretty transparent. You can see the syscalls and everything. And second of all, especially when dealing with microcontrollers, trusting the runtime is a sure way to get screwed
[12:35:20] <gurkenglas> tldr: take 10 distributions (humanity's subjective probability distributions over the true values of the constants "planets per star","habitable planets per planet",...), take each's average, multiply them up, you get an estimate for the product
[12:35:23] <quanticle> Microcontroller toolchains are very diverse, but somehow they all manage to be crap
[12:35:42] <gurkenglas> it's a *bad* estimate. sample a factor from each distribution, the product ends up on average much lower
[12:36:00] <gurkenglas> aliens are just less likely than you'd think, sorta like conjunctive fallacy.
[12:38:22] <gurkenglas> ("on average much lower" is the wrong way to say it - you get a distribution that naturally lives not in "how many alien civs are there" but "how many orders of magnitude of alien civs are there", which is absolutely allowed to come out with "very few" where in the non-log scale you get confused by the unlikelihood of your observation)
[12:39:12] <PapuaHardyNet> I see, you are saying that by using averages instead of the probability distributions themselves, the result has been inflated
[12:39:19] <gurkenglas> (i think the average still works out the same? but just because of the outliers of all the factors turning out big, making the sample astronomical)
[12:39:30] *** Quits: MerchantOfVenice (~patrick@user/merchantofvenice) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[12:42:34] <PapuaHardyNet> are you saying that the average of the fermi estimate prob dist function is the same as the calculated value?
[12:42:42] <gurkenglas> (compare a simulation of the game behind the sankt petersburg paradox game, the sample value with probability one ends up below the theoretical expected value)
[12:43:43] <PapuaHardyNet> okay I don't know that game and I won't read up on it, can't get nerdsniped right now
[12:44:03] <PapuaHardyNet> (I did see that it is a board game though so I got some context)

[12:49:46] <gurkenglas> kuudes: "yes" as in "kuudes knew that and it's ~sad that kuudes didn't know to tell gurkenglas this"? what other such things can you think of on reflection?
[12:50:38] <kuudes> hard to say
[12:52:26] <kuudes> but that is indeed in the basis that I see the "real" thing of anything being distributed in whole area of real numbers; if your distribution is probabilities, ie ]0,1[ you need to transform it to real values with inverted gaussian or inverted logistic; if it is in positive values ]0,+inf[ then you need to transform it with logarithm etc etc. you need toget to ]-inf,+inf[ and then you usually can just do summation and things related to summation
[12:53:52] <gurkenglas> you could try saying other math cool facts that you expect me to already know, here's a social-capital-with-me grant to guard against me already knowing a bunch of them
[12:57:50] <gurkenglas> doesn't this mean that machine learning libraries should be statically typed, so people who think it's all trial and error don't go around plugging a sigmoid into a ReLU's place?
[12:58:22] <PapuaHardyNet> huh?
[12:59:00] <kuudes> I don't think it is that strict. the math wants to work. the result just is more spaghetti
[12:59:19] <gurkenglas> sure but have you considered that this is bad
[12:59:20] <PapuaHardyNet> so sigmoid has range [0, 1], and ReLU has range [0, inf], but there's a much bigger impact of what activation you use
[12:59:23] <kuudes> https://nitter.net/iaponomarenko/status/1497128097140858901?s=24
[12:59:24] <Robomot> Illia Ponomarenko (@IAPonomarenko): "It is now confirmed — Ukrainian military has delivered a strike on a Russian airfield in Millerovo, Rostov Oblast / A number of enemy aircraft have been destroyed." | nitter (It is now confirmed — Ukrainian military has delivered a strike on a Russian airfield in Millerovo, Rostov Oblast / A number of enemy aircraft have been destroyed.)
[12:59:26] <kuudes> gurkenglas, sure
[13:00:13] <PapuaHardyNet> your weight initialization depends on your activations, for example. the tendency for the network to have vanishing and exploding gradients, again, depends on the activations
[13:00:25] <gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet: it's not about the literal range of numbers, those are just a convenient handrail. it's about the unit of the numbers
[13:00:51] <kuudes> gurkenglas, well, another related thing is that charts that are on positive space, ie stock indexes, should be taken with log to full reals, and after that you can compare their derivatives instantly and over time etc
[13:01:19] <kuudes> well yes, but there is always the unit, it just gets to random positions
[13:01:35] <PapuaHardyNet> well, if that's what you think. I haven't encountered people using activations (except the output) with a "unit" (like what kuudes talked about) in mind
[13:01:53] <kuudes> gurkenglas, hmm. item response theory is one thing that was an epiphany to me
[13:01:54] <gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet: Like, in everyday life it doesn't make sense to multiply a temperature by two.
[13:01:55] <PapuaHardyNet> (and even for the output just pipe it into softmax if necessary so)
[13:02:25] <PapuaHardyNet> I don't see how that applies to neural networks
[13:02:31] <kuudes> so you can just define two different measures in multidimensional space to be the fixed points, and then you can orient everything else in that space re those on a linear dimension
[13:03:03] <kuudes> the loss of accuracy happens the farther from both fixed points you go, between them it is best and near them it is ok
[13:03:23] <gurkenglas> fixed points of what
[13:03:37] <kuudes> of the thing you want to measure
[13:03:51] <gurkenglas> oh, not fixed points of a function from a set to itself, then.
[13:04:34] <kuudes> like, with temperature, before we knew it was an actual limited function of absolute zero, the point was to fix some points and then you would take other measurements to that line
[13:04:50] <kuudes> ie 0 at water freeze, 100 at ware vaporization, measure the rest
[13:05:08] <kuudes> but with irt you can do this to arbitrary things that are correlated well enough to your taste
[13:05:19] <gurkenglas> sure. by "measure in multidimensional space" you also don't mean the kind of thing that the lebesgue measure is?
[13:06:45] <gurkenglas> (aka a thing that integrates a function X->R into a real number R)
[13:07:02] <kuudes> yeah, seems possibly like that
[13:07:15] <kuudes> I think yeah
[13:08:18] <gurkenglas> I don't get it yet, can you say the IRT insight in terms of functions?
[13:09:24] <kuudes> irt helps you to map probability densities to linear axis of their common correlation axis
[13:10:12] <gurkenglas> You have a thing from a set X, you want to know which it is. You have a function X->Y and you know what your thing maps to.
[13:10:35] <kuudes> ie if 2/3 of people get secondary degree, and 1/3 of people get tertiary degree, you can define secondary degree to be at point 0 and tertiary degree at point 1, and then you can find out things like "people get primary school done" or "people get a doctorate"
[13:11:24] <gurkenglas> There are two reference things a and b from X, they map to fa and fb in Y, this lets you say what about your thing?
[13:13:06] <kuudes> sorry, a bit too ill at the moment
[13:13:14] <gurkenglas> Restating what you said: every Person has a state of Education, you don't know it. You know a bunch of other things about the person like how much time it spends on facebook, because facebook sells you this.
[13:13:31] <gurkenglas> call the vector of numbers you have about the person Observations
[13:14:25] <gurkenglas> (i mean, call the space of such vectors Observations.)
[13:14:33] <gurkenglas> (because capital letter.)
[13:14:59] <gurkenglas> IRT lets you calculate a function from Observations to Distributions-over-Education?
[13:16:25] <gurkenglas> "too ill" means "too ill to continue replying", imma guess now.

[13:18:16] <gurkenglas> (as opposed to "to perform as impressively as i expect of myself")
[13:19:41] <gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet: perhaps unit also has the wrong connotations? the proper word to use is "types"
[13:20:16] <gurkenglas> and its connotations are that you can compose two functions if the target type of the one matches the source type of the other.
[13:21:16] <gurkenglas> so that, if you're writing ML code and you start writing "log(log(x))" the compiler can say "are you sure"
[13:24:23] <gurkenglas> (i have encountered double exponentials in ~two places: someone is proving that a hypercomputer can do a thing and therefore careless with the sizes of numbers; and a math student is very confused)

[14:20:59] <PapuaHardyNet> gurkenglas: I agree with you that numbers do have "types", although I don't think it is a good idea for programming languages to explicitly separate out these types
[14:21:49] <PapuaHardyNet> or for functions to have input and output expected types
[14:21:56] <PapuaHardyNet> (for numbers I mean)
[14:23:38] <gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet: Why not?
[14:31:48] <PapuaHardyNet> I have reconsidered, it is a good idea as long as they aren't hard types. hard types differentiating numbers with the same values but different meanings is a bad idea. That's not what types are for. soft types are quite useful, and I genuinely see the extreme benefit (for example, einsum notation), but making it implicit seems like a bad idea.
[14:32:21] <PapuaHardyNet> say you initialize numbers with a soft type, *then* ideally log(log(x)) should throw a warning
[14:33:24] <PapuaHardyNet> also see https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/named_tensor.html
[14:33:24] <Robomot> Named Tensors — PyTorch 1.10 documentation
[14:36:53] <gurkenglas> i tried using that but i kept running into the obvious math things not working
[14:38:31] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, I expected that. I was mainly pointing you to the theory behind it, because I think that's a better implementation. Instead of hard types, numbers with associated "meaning", which is optional
[14:38:38] <gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet: re discoverability. Suppose I am looking at the /dev/ directory and seeing lots of special files. How would I go about jumping to their item description, or i guess their implementation, or at least all the places they are used
[14:39:04] <PapuaHardyNet> more context please
[14:39:34] <PapuaHardyNet> is this related to linux only or when using emacs?
[14:41:13] <gurkenglas> linux, i thought you were using that since you were using emacs.
[14:41:58] <PapuaHardyNet> well, I thought you are referring to using emacs to browse `/dev/` and try to understand what is going on in there
[14:42:53] <PapuaHardyNet> anyway, I don't know enough about linux to tell you how to do these things. Let me check arch wiki
[14:43:37] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah okay I don't think there's a utility. If you find one, let me know.
[14:43:39] <gurkenglas> nah its fine, i understand i could google or wiki it,
[14:43:50] <PapuaHardyNet> oh hey. hold on
[14:43:52] <gurkenglas> oh i see, you were in fact looking for an answer to my actual question ^^
[14:44:01] <PapuaHardyNet> I did - https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/devices.html
[14:44:02] <Robomot> Linux allocated devices (4.x+ version) — The Linux Kernel documentation
[14:44:09] <PapuaHardyNet> I mean I found a manual at least not a utility
[14:45:00] <PapuaHardyNet> anyway, I guess you could map a keybind to send gptsh a prompt "I am using emacs, and browsing the directory /dev/. What is the purpose of the file /dev/tty?"
[14:45:39] <PapuaHardyNet> replace "/dev/tty" with whatever keyword you are on, and the "and browsing a directory /dev/" with relevant emacs context
[14:45:53] <gurkenglas> Sure! (though gptsh is structured to reply with a command. which would in fact give a good reply, if that works)
[14:46:03] <gurkenglas> (to the actual question, not the specific one)
[14:46:15] <PapuaHardyNet> okay then, I meant GPT3
[14:46:53] <PapuaHardyNet> (I just remembered seeing that prompt for gptsh you linked. not very open-ended)
[14:48:09] <gurkenglas> (it is good to get a reply that's made of parts you can use elsewhere.)
[14:49:50] <quanticle> >hard types differentiating numbers with the same values but different meanings is a bad idea. That's not what types are for.
[14:49:52] <quanticle> What on earth are you talking about? That's *exactly* what types are for. If I have 32-bit integer that represents a count, I definitely want to distinguish it from a 32-bit integers that represents a memory address. If I have a variable that contains a measurement in foot-pounds, I don't want to confuse it with a variable that represents a measurement in newton-meters.
[14:49:54] <quanticle> Having hard types differentiating numbers with the same values but different meanings is, to a first approximation, the *only* way to make reliable software
[14:53:19] <PapuaHardyNet> I disagree. types are mainly about structure of data and not about the meaning of data.
[14:54:11] <quanticle> Only if your type system is crap
[14:54:15] <PapuaHardyNet> if you don't want to confuse variables, you *can* name them more verbosely
[14:54:46] <PapuaHardyNet> i've never used haskell, so I may not know how useful extreme typing is.
[14:54:49] <gurkenglas> Friends. There is a category of structure and one of meaning and both are closed under composition.
[14:56:51] <quanticle> Sure, I can do all sorts of things with variable names. But, if I want to actually verify that I'm using the variable correctly, then I need to either
[14:56:53] <quanticle> 1. Have the type system check for me
[14:56:55] <quanticle> or
[14:56:57] <quanticle> 2. Write a metric fuckton of unit tests
[14:56:59] <quanticle> (1) is by far the easier approach
[14:57:01] <quanticle> It's why, every time there's a loosely typed language (like Javascript, or Python), after a while you see people bolting a type system onto it
[14:57:03] <quanticle> They're not doing this because it's fun. They're doing it because, once your codebase grows beyond a certain size, having the machine enforce correct usage is the only reasonable way to prevent errors.
[14:58:10] <PapuaHardyNet> okay, I agree with you. Now tell me how you would solve the log(log(x)) problem
[14:58:52] <quanticle> What is the log(log(x)) problem?
[14:59:47] <PapuaHardyNet> gurkenglas claims that we should use types to warn people who write log(log(x)) because that is usually not what a user intends
[15:00:03] <PapuaHardyNet> <gurkenglas> so that, if you're writing ML code and you start writing "log(log(x))" the compiler can say "are you sure"
[15:01:43] <quanticle> Are there any cases where a user would want to take a logarithm of a logarithm?
[15:02:48] <PapuaHardyNet> if they have taken an exponent of an exponent, I assume. logs are useful. logs of logs? I've never seen it happen. However, as you can see from your very question, using types, either soft or hard, is not a solution for this
[15:04:54] <PapuaHardyNet> would you really want to define log(x) as a function that only takes Float and only returns LogFloat? both are (for example) 64 bit numbers. No reason to impose additional context.
[15:05:08] <quanticle> You're wrong
[15:05:10] <quanticle> You can your logarithm function output a logarithm type. So you have log(x: int | float): log
[15:05:12] <quanticle> Then if you do log(log(x)), you get an error, because you tried to pass a log to a function that was expecting int or float.
[15:05:14] <quanticle> If you want to actually do log(log(x)), you'd have to log(float(log(x))), forcing you to be explicit
[15:05:54] <quanticle> Presumably you're not just taking logarithms of numbers just for fun. What does the logarithm mean?
[15:05:58] <PapuaHardyNet> your log type, is this a subset of the float type?
[15:06:17] <PapuaHardyNet> it isn't? Then you now have to rewrite entire libraries
[15:07:52] <quanticle> Well, like I said above: what is the actual meaning of log(x)?
[15:09:21] <PapuaHardyNet> assuming this isn't a philosophical or rhetorical question, the answer is that it is up to the user
[15:10:20] <PapuaHardyNet> now, one solution is to add metadata to objects (numbers), and have the functions check for metadata (which is your type system but less stringent). Even so, this still feels hacky. Do you have any better ideas?
[15:10:58] <PapuaHardyNet> the idea of adding metadata is the same as that of adding "types" to tensors as shown here https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/named_tensor.html
[15:10:58] <Robomot> Named Tensors — PyTorch 1.10 documentation
[15:11:59] <PapuaHardyNet> I guess we both are saying the same thing, where you claim we must use the most fundamental strong type system, while I claim we should use a rather weak / optional typing system
[15:12:00] <quanticle> Heck, I've run into exactly the problem you're describing at work, and I resolved it with types, in Python. We have area measurements. Some of them are in square feet. Some are in acres. Some are in square meters. I defined separate types for each unit and annotated the Python code with the appropriate types. Ran mypy on the codebase and instantly found a few bugs where we were skipping
[15:12:02] <quanticle> conversions.
[15:13:26] <PapuaHardyNet> that's good to hear. would you say that you would have preferred the types be harder?
[15:13:39] <quanticle> Absolutely.
[15:13:56] <quanticle> The problem wouldn't even have occured if we were using e.g. Scala
[15:16:54] *** Quits: Obormot\Arcturus (~obormot@user/obormot) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[15:16:54] *** Quits: Robomot (~Robomot@user/robomot) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[15:17:28] <PapuaHardyNet> I'll pay more attention to the importance of types then
[15:18:23] <quanticle> Or heck, we wouldn't even have had that problem in C++. One of my friends worked at Boeing and wrote an entire C++ library specifically to do typed calculations, with compile time checking to ensure that you could never mix up different unit types in your calculation
[15:19:04] <quanticle> The amount of template metaprogramming involved was forbidding, but it worked
[15:21:26] <PapuaHardyNet> I guess I could roughly ape that by adding asserts in the start and end of functions
[15:23:19] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, I'll try Types, AnnotatedTensors, and mypy
[15:32:57] <PapuaHardyNet> people who use a notation and never explain it. why do they exist.

[19:41:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> .note adiabatic So I made biscotti for the first time ever. They turned out ... surprisingly excellent? Not even "for a first attempt" but actually very good! I can see myself making these things reguarly... used this recipe: https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/pumpkin-seed-cranberry-biscotti/ - no modifications. Everything as written. They came out just as in the photo

[20:33:39] <gwern> Obormot\Gaia: I agree that dark mode link icons are probably too pale. how should we handle this? the light mode icons don't strike me as too dark, so we could just go through and bump every opacity: declaration by 5%

[20:45:28] <two2thehead> trippy flame optics
[20:48:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Yeah hold off on that a bit, when I have time over the next couple days I'll see if I can do it a little more elegantly than that... if that doesn't work out, then yeah, as you say, just bump those opacities up in dark-mode-adjustments
[20:50:04] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: but there is no opacity for most of these in dark-mode adjustments is there? even if you override the classes like 'italic' or 'quad', there's still like 30 specific ones. would we just copy all of them and bump up?
[20:51:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Sure, all the ones that need adjusted. I mean, a huge advantage of the new system is that any given icon can be referred to individually, affecting nothing else. So - Google icon needs adjusting? You select on `a[data-link-icon='google']` and put whatever tweaks
[20:51:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> But like I said, I think there might be a slightly more elegant solution, so, table this for a bit

[21:52:37] <PapuaHardyNet> kek
[21:52:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is that their way of avoiding saying "human resources" or what
[21:53:31] <PapuaHardyNet> "Still not sure if I would recommend doing a PhD though: it was definitely bad for my mental health." yeah, I don't think you need a PhD to become a good software dev
[21:53:32] <feep> head of x is pretty normal naming
[21:55:00] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : Have you had any mental problems?
[21:55:00] <two2thehead> No! Just shut up while I talk with the aliens!
[21:55:06] <PapuaHardyNet> "I get to directly work on solving really important problems for people (e.g. allowing people to cheaply pay their bills from their phone instead of walking miles to an agency or paying large fees). This kind of work doesn’t seem to be possible in developed world software because all of the low-hanging fruit has already been picked so you just work on making cat pictures load faster or making someone else’s job slightly more efficient, etc"
[21:55:32] <PapuaHardyNet> doesn't this seem to be a false dichotomy?
[21:55:57] <feep> two2thehead: ehh.
[21:59:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: I don't know if it's a false dichotomy or not, but it's definitely pretty dumb to say that there's nothing left to do in the developed world except make cat pictures load faster
[21:59:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'm *pretty sure* there are *some* people doing more consequential work than that, right here in the U. S. of A.
[22:00:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe what the guy means is that there isn't any important work left that you could do in the developed world *that will result in you making big piles of money*
[22:00:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> That might be true!
[22:00:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> It also might not be true, but it's at least not obviously false
[22:00:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> But probably that's impolitic to say
[22:01:33] <Ralith> the low hanging fruit of software is like 10% picked
[22:01:48] <Ralith> execution is hard, running a business is hard
[22:02:07] <feep> tbf, also possibly the problems are more legible in senegal
[22:02:37] <feep> also possibly more code tractable
[22:03:05] <synthmeat> people are hardest tho
[22:03:18] <feep> eh, imo bureaucracy is harder
[22:03:27] <feep> we're evolved to interact with people
[22:03:41] <Ralith> is bureaucracy not people
[22:03:54] <feep> bureaucracy is executed on people, but it is not people
[22:03:57] <synthmeat> ok, i'd maybe buy that wrt bureocracy. i keep forgetting it's not all americans in here :)

[22:29:03] <rsaarelm> I just came up with a new thing that's wrong in the world and I can be upset about: The url scheme for paging view in blogs like tumblr. It's counting up in reverse chronological order so /page/1 is the front page, /page/2 the stuff right after that and so on. This is changing all the time and shit for archiving the page view. There should be stable pages so that /page/1/ is the oldest stuff,
[22:29:05] <rsaarelm> /page/2/ is the second oldest, and you'd get /page/1231/ or whatever when you click next page off the front page.
