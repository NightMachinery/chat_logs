[03:11:25] <piou> I mean, I expect freight to be the vast majority of any country's rail usage so I don't really see how that's misleading
[03:11:49] <Joanna> You often can’t get from point a to point b even if both places are along the same railroad track
[03:12:30] <Joanna> Well for me the term rail network means I can travel anywhere I want by rail almost
[03:13:10] <[iz]> usa is too big for rail travel of people
[03:13:43] <edk> china and india are big

[03:15:36] <[iz]> yeah, but i mean.. there's lots of stuff inbetween to have stops at
[03:16:23] <piou> sure, but nobody ever said it had to be fast to be useful
[03:16:29] <Joanna> It’s not that it’s too big it’s that the automotive interests control the us. It would be a good candidate for maglev trains.
[03:16:59] <piou> Meh, too much rails to replace IMHO
[03:17:16] <piou> (many rails? dunno)
[03:18:40] <[iz]> too much rail or too many rails, i think
[03:18:48] <piou> thanks
[03:18:50] <Joanna> Automotive interests bought and destroyed every light rail system in the USA and it’s no secret.
[03:20:06] <[iz]> well, not really
[03:20:49] <[iz]> it's cuz the new deal in the 1930s created the federal highway system
[03:21:00] <Joanna> The government using tax money to fund the highways didn’t help either
[03:21:19] <[iz]> yeah, i think that's the big thing the caused the move away from rail in the usa
[03:21:33] <MadCamel> my city had electric streetcars in the 40s. lots of them. the rails are still there under the roads. they damage the repaving machinery heh
[03:21:44] <Joanna> But to force people to stop using street cars they literally destroyed the street cars.
[03:22:04] <Joanna> People preferred street cars

Simmilar for other computer/devices, but different folders... Last time I did it, it was a bit of a mess... I did it by ip (all machines have static ips), but I'ld like something safer... what do you recommend and do you have a guide for
[08:04:22] <Phantom> that? or a gui or something for easier management? oh and all files must be created under one account...

[10:09:58] <ajak> if you're doing it for the first time it's really better to learn as much about it as you can rather than relying on some GUI abstraction of it
[10:11:28] <Phantom> I might as well do that
[10:12:13] <Phantom> but considering that what I want to protect against and how I'm already setup, it shouln't be bad
[10:13:36] <Phantom> I mean, I have zfs, and I will resetup the automatic snapshotting. So what I want now is just that the users can't delete my files by mistake. And windows viruses (mainly cryptolockers) shouln't be much of an issue due to the snapshotting anyway, and root is not shared
