[00:29:47] <willow> hello, since recent update of either Windows or UEFI firmware, running 'grub-install' has no effect.  every time i boot it boots straight to Windows.  
[00:30:01] <willow> efibootmgr looks correct:  https://www.imgpaste.net/image/KVtQQs
[00:30:20] <willow> but it's like the computer is totally ignoring it and just always booting into Windows
[00:31:07] <willow> the only way i found to boot Linux so far is to rename EFI/Microsoft

[01:05:09] <bay> my guess is that these files are what is controlling the boot, ignoring whatever efibootmgr and grub touch

[02:21:06] <jhutchins> I'd be surprised if they didn't just wipeit and reinstall windows.

[02:31:08] <willow> think i found the solution to the EFI problem.  in EFI set to not lock the boot order.  let Windows set Windows Boot Manager as the top item.  In Windows go into Power Settings -> Change what buttons do and disable fast startup.  Then go into live Linux rescue and re-do grub-install
[02:32:05] <willow> and you can then also do efibootmgr -b 0000 -A   to disable Windows Boot Mananger although I don't know if that really does anything
[02:32:49] <willow> basically just let Windows do what it wants and for whatever reason grub works around it.  but if you try to disable Windows Boot Manager boot option in EFI settings it doesn't like it
[02:33:18] <willow> probably the engineers at Lenovo can't conceive that anyone would run their laptops without Windows ;-(
[02:33:53] <jhutchins> willow: IBM, hence Lenovo, is one of the largest linux users in the world.
[02:34:40] <willow> jhutchins: why then does the support page for Lenovo ThinkPad not even have any software/updates/drivers for Linux?
[02:35:12] <willow> IBM is not Lenovo btw

[07:34:02] <sney> !uupdate
[07:34:02] <dpkg> uupdate (in the <devscripts> package) upgrades a source code package from an upstream revision, or e.g. if the newest foo in debian is 1.2, and upstream is at 1.4: apt-get source foo; wget -nd http://foo.org/foo-1.4.tar.gz; cd foo-1.2; uupdate ../foo-1.4.tar.gz  Ask me about <package recompile>.

[08:17:42] <johnjay> what is the difference between bullseye-updates and bullseye/updates?
[08:17:47] <johnjay> I had to delete the latter when upgrading

[08:19:30] <nvs> it should have debian-security as part of the URL, not just debian
[08:19:38] <johnjay> ah yes security is in the URL

[08:20:54] <johnjay> by the way should I have used debian backports?
[08:21:06] <johnjay> i only upgraded to bullseye for git since git 2.20 is apparently "outdated" 
[08:21:24] <nvs> the only repo that should be specified during an update is the main one.
[08:21:26] <jmcnaught> !bullseye sources.list
[08:21:26] <dpkg> A suitable /etc/apt/sources.list for "Bullseye" has three lines: "deb https://deb.debian.org/debian/ bullseye main" "deb https://deb.debian.org/debian-security bullseye-security main" "deb https://deb.debian.org/debian/ bullseye-updates main".  Note that bullseye does not yet have security support and is a <moving target>. See <deb-src> <contrib> <non-free> <bullseye-security>, or <bullseye-updates> and "man sources.list".
[08:21:54] <PMT> johnjay: outdated according to what?
[08:22:08] <johnjay> according to the program i wanted to install, doom emacs
[08:22:15] <johnjay> git 2.23 or greater is required it tells me
[08:22:31] <johnjay> i didn't check for a backport but would that have been the better option?
[08:22:41] <PMT> buster-backports would have been less disruptive, probably.
[08:22:55] <johnjay> i assume actual labor and effort goes into making sure backports work
[08:22:58] <johnjay> ok

[09:45:15] <ZeroBeholder> So, I got a FreeIPA server up on Fedora. I have a client running on Debian Bullseye-- yaay (ntp needs installed before, NBD). ...I can't help but feel that it is overkill. I really just want a known machine to ask a horizontally scalable server if a user is allowed to be on that machine and what groups that user is part of. I am in the sudo group on all machines, Bob is in the sudo group on the DB machine only. That kind of stuff.
[09:45:17] <ZeroBeholder>  RBAC via group membership.
[09:46:44] <ZeroBeholder> NIS is so almost what I am looking for. And if it were more secure I'd slam it in and call it a day. But, it's not.
[09:47:49] <ZeroBeholder> Also, I'd like to not have one single weird Fedora machine in my system.

[19:10:01] <dpkg> Debian "Bullseye" is the current testing branch as of 2019-07-06 and it will be released "when it's ready." Release day we're working to currently - as discussed in various mailing lists is August 14th 2021. There's a hard freeze from July 17th with only the most urgent security fixes after that date. The main CD builder died - all disks failed at once, so the current target is August 14th, or even later.
