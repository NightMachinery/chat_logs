[00:21:40] <Henry151> hmm i'll give that a shot

[00:51:10] <FunkyBob> I don't believe there should the a comma between the url()  and format() in the src: clause

[00:55:58] <Henry151> well FunkyBob you've solved it! Also thanks to eXtr3m0 your input may have been necessary as well, in any case it is working now. Thanks y'all!
[00:56:32] <FunkyBob> wait,... so it was format hitns all along?
[00:56:38] <FunkyBob> hints  you didn't have originally?
[00:56:57] <FunkyBob> (though originally you had _only_ ttf... so maybe adding other formats was the real solution)
[00:57:01] <Henry151> not sure.. i added woff and woff2 files
[00:57:28] <Henry151> yeah so it could have been adding the other formats, but i also had not specified format previously
[00:58:29] <FunkyBob> sure, but according to a couple of sources, no browser cares about thos hints anyway
[00:58:36] <Henry151> a second question, on the same site, where it has the email link, that is displaying as blue text, i had wanted to make it dark green and failed so far
[00:58:50] <FunkyBob> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face#browser_compatibility
[00:58:54] <Henry151> i set a { text-decoration: none; text-decoration-color: darkgreen; font-color: darkgreen;
[00:59:05] <FunkyBob> yes,
[00:59:22] <FunkyBob> if you look at the CSS validation ^^ ... you'll see it doesn't thin darkgreen is a real colour

[01:00:13] <FunkyBob> ah
[01:00:16] <FunkyBob> it's "color" not "font-color"

[01:07:30] <Henry151> whoops spoke too soon
[01:07:42] <FunkyBob> a bit redundant having a <p> inside a <h1>
[01:07:46] <FunkyBob> and you didn't close it in order
[01:08:25] <FunkyBob> best not to wrap that <p> in the <h1> if all y ou're trying to do is get rid of the warning
[01:08:56] <FunkyBob> also seems odd to have all those <div>s wrapping your header and footer elements
[01:11:38] <Henry151> thanks for the input.. i am kinda new at this as you can tell, but i put the divs there to get the flexbox containers working right. I am trying to refactor it without changing the way it displays now, to make it follow best practices and make sense/look right
[01:11:53] <FunkyBob> that's fine... we're here for everyone to learn
[01:11:58] <Henry151> i do have zero errors now so that's a good start :)
[01:12:09] <Henry151> i have like 8 more websites to do this to
[01:12:16] <FunkyBob> you can apply classes and styles to the header and footer and so on...
[01:12:22] <FunkyBob> they're block elements, by default, just like div
[01:13:19] <Henry151> biggest mess is probably rompwelding.com because i made that in the most awful way, copy-pasting code from some other site and changing out the images and text, but now my brother who owns the company likes the way it looks, so i have to fix it without changing how it looks

[01:14:39] <FunkyBob> heh
[01:15:09] <Henry151> i have such a mess, my sites are each hosted on their own vultr vps as well, costing me $6/month each for the vps, i need to consolidate them onto one machine to cut down the wasted money
[01:15:36] <Henry151> i don't know why i did it that way exactly, seemed like a good idea at the time
[01:17:12] <Henry151> someday i want to make a modern re-do of https://rompfamily.com as well, my dad made that in 1999 and i restored it from the internet archive the other day, but it would be fun to redo it in a more modern style
[01:18:33] <FunkyBob> ugh, yeah
[01:18:59] <FunkyBob> one site per VM... not the most cost effective solution
[01:20:03] <Henry151> yeah, i had previously been hosting them all on my dell poweredge in my living room, but when i had a hard-drive failure, i realized i had failed to backup my /var and lost all the sites at once, it was awful
[01:20:44] <Henry151> so i somehow in the heat of the moment thought "i'll make each one have their own vps, that way any one failing won't break the others and i won't have to worry about maintaining the hardware"
[01:20:57] <Henry151> but that was a foolish move and it is costing me money
[01:21:07] <Henry151> but so much to do and so little time..
[01:21:22] <FunkyBob> name based virtual hosting is a non-effort these days,
[01:22:32] <Henry151> yeah i think that's how i had it set up on my home webserver here
[01:22:52] <Henry151> i had one apache2 instance running on the dell poweredge, with all the sites hosted there
[01:23:39] <Henry151> but losing my /var was a pretty hard blow, took me a long while to get things back to where they were beforehand. Thank god for the internet archive. I donate to them every time i have a few spare bucks.

[01:25:43] <FunkyBob> i can imagine
[01:25:59] <FunkyBob> i suspect most people these days would use nginx, not apache... but hey, if it works for you
[01:27:23] <Henry151> i used nginx previously, but i switched to apache at some point, i forget why exactly... i think i just was reading some "apache vs nginx" thing talking about the differences between them and liked the sound of apache more. At this point, i'm much more comfortable with apache just because i've used it more
[01:30:59] <Henry151> ah i remember now actually, that's not accurate
[01:32:00] <Henry151> i was trying to set up a reverse proxy to serve something... deluge i think? and i couldn't figure it out with nginx, and they had clear directions for how to do it on apache so i just switched to apache then and have never gone back
[01:33:17] <Henry151> reading now about the differences between the two, it sounds like nginx is probably a better choice

[02:33:53] <barkle> yeah like 98%
[02:35:50] <eXtr3m0> barkle can you also define your end goal? do you want it to behave like a "inner border"?
[02:36:18] <eXtr3m0> so if more line of text come in, the red square will become a red bar?

[03:07:44] <barkle> it's inline

[03:42:25] <eXtr3m0> you need to describe more what your goal is, because there are many ways to do this, but they then have different consequences..
[03:42:54] <barkle> eXtr3m0: lines should wrap as usual
[03:43:32] <barkle> it should 'float' below the square

[03:51:51] <eXtr3m0> I know you said 1px, but you also set a padding of 5px to the yellow one, so not sure where the red one shall go.
[03:52:23] <eXtr3m0> *, *::before, *::after { box-sizing: border-box; } Is what I'd always use btw.
[03:53:07] <eXtr3m0> this way border values are not added to width/height values
[03:53:38] <eXtr3m0> its the thing you want most of the time
[03:53:52] <eXtr3m0> you can also leave it and work with calc() nowadays but I wouldn't recommend.
[04:00:58] <stenno> i didn't know box model was relevant for pseudoelements
[04:05:18] <eXtr3m0> box model is revelant for everything that is a box. in this case we use the pseudoelement as a box
[04:05:54] <eXtr3m0> they will not inherit the box-sizeing property value from their parent and therefore we need to address them separately in the global definition.
[04:06:07] <eXtr3m0> *box-sizing
[04:08:59] <eXtr3m0> btw default box sizeing also adds padding+border width ontop of the defined width.
[04:09:13] <eXtr3m0> Wow that is so annoying. I didn't had this problem for like 10 years. :D:D
[04:16:52] <FunkyBob> some css starter I used to crib always started with; html { box-sizing: border-box; } *, *:before, *:after { box-sizing: inherit; }
[04:17:12] <FunkyBob> overcame that non-inheritance, and let you locally override
[04:20:17] <eXtr3m0> you can always locally overwrite because the selector with the highest specificity will always win
[04:20:49] <eXtr3m0> p { } or p:before { } are more specific then * or *:before

[10:48:02] <Stinger> I have a div with some text in it that is 20px high, what min-height should I use to make sure it is the same with no text in it (collapses to 0)
[10:48:11] <Stinger> I use 1em and get 18px
[10:49:31] <Stinger> or is it because my surrounding element for the one that has text has a 1px padding?

[21:44:25] <nullkit> is it possible to set BORDER such as    border: solid 2px 3px 4px 5px black;   ?
[21:45:33] <eXtr3m0> nullkit you can set the border-radius property to 2px 3px 4px 5px
[21:46:49] <nullkit> eXtr3m0: i wanna hide or set border-bottom:0px;   how i can do it ?
[21:47:11] <nullkit> my question is it possible to set them all in one row ?
[21:47:19] <nullkit> in code
[21:47:52] <eXtr3m0> for example by adding an additional class .toggle-border { border-bottom:0px; } or as you just said, .toggle-border { border-radius: 2px 3px 0px 5px }
[21:49:05] <eXtr3m0> you could also use css custom properties, but don't seem to be needed really since border-bottom is available to use.
[21:51:07] <nullkit> eXtr3m0: thank you
[21:51:35] <eXtr3m0> nullkit you're welcome
