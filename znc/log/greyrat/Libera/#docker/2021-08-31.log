[00:10:40] *** Joins: farmstatejake (~farmstate@user/farmstatejake)
[00:12:08] <programmerq> that script is to run on the host to see if it's configured to run docker.
[00:12:27] <programmerq> it has some things that are just warning level, but if you have some network setting or sysctl that is necessary, it should pick it up.
[00:12:59] <programmerq> archlinux is pretty freely configurable, so it could be something specific to your config, or a broken package too.
[00:13:11] <programmerq> but I'm not aware of any specific issue with docker on archlinux these days.

[00:25:44] <artok> seemingly.. 
[00:27:11] <artok> wrong config for dns or firewall blocking connection

[00:30:54] <halosghost> they can make requests to the internet, just not resolve DNS names ☺
[00:31:45] <newpy> can some one explain to me what the answer here means: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59289917/how-to-use-a-yaml-file-with-dockerfile-to-activate-conda-environment
[00:33:06] <newpy> user tries `conda create env` in dockerfile, gets an error "your shell has not been properfly configured to use conda activate"

[17:44:37] <s17> download the models to your localhost and then mount the directory to the container
[17:45:25] <s17> jsut like it says in the linked article..
[17:45:32] <s17> Open the terminal and cd to the cloned repository in your local machine. In the repository, you will find a file called download_model.py. Use one of the following commands to download the required GPT-2 model.
[17:49:36] <cloudcell> s17, so what you suggest is to simply skip downloading this file and load it by mounting the directory...
[17:50:06] <cloudcell> thus I can simply load this stuff into the docker container
[17:51:40] <cloudcell> yeah, makes sense. sorry i'm probably too tired from this already :) thank you s17
[17:51:41] <s17> yes, if the container is failing to download it, you can just download it to your localhost and then 'share' it to the container by way of mounting

[22:13:06] <Nnavd> Hm, I need to get a git version in my docker image, but the git repos really slow down builds when I remove them from dockerignore - is there maybe an easier way to get the version that doesn't involve a script calling docker build? Or is there maybe a specific .git file I can copy to only get the revision?

[22:49:27] <tabakhase> Nnavd like your current head? sure
[22:51:48] <programmerq> HEAD could point to a branch or tag or orphan ref, so it may not be super helpful. if you always want to grab the git sha, then HEAD probably won't do what you need.
[22:52:01] <tabakhase> .git/HEAD & .git/refs/heads/ is all you should need - and for "slow" it be mostly up to .git/objects, so throw that entirely
[22:52:48] <programmerq> yeah, that's true. ignoring just the objects just might work?

[23:13:02] <Nnavd> I also need the tag programmerq - the git command breaks if I attempt to exclude just objects
[23:13:14] <Nnavd> as far as I can tell the latest tag is not anywhere in .git

[23:23:43] <programmerq> yeah, it looks like the tag info is under objects/ so that wouldn't work.

[23:41:00] <newpy> why does `conda env create --file environment.yml` persist after stopping a container where as other things dont?
[23:41:08] <newpy> is there an easy rule of thumb?
[23:42:43] <newpy> oh it's only lost when you recreate the container
