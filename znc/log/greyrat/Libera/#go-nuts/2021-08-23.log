[00:00:18] <preyalone> How can we make it like A?
[00:00:36] <Tv_> start with checking whether the assumption is right
[00:00:41] <Tv_> compare the directory trees
[00:00:54] <preyalone> Is go mod vendor broken?
[00:00:57] <Tv_> you might find that the `cpp` subdirectory is completely missing in B & C
[00:03:34] <ikke> https://github.com/mcandre/octane/tree/master/vendor/gitlab.com/gomidi/rtmididrv/imported/rtmidi
[00:04:00] <preyalone> Here is the diff between the working and broken versions: https://github.com/mcandre/octane/compare/update-go-mod-format?expand=1
[00:04:02] <Tv_> the include was for "cpp/RtMidi.h"
[00:04:33] <preyalone> The only difference is some comments, and the file format.
[00:04:39] <Tv_> so it does seem like cgo is finding the .h in https://github.com/mcandre/octane/blob/master/vendor/gitlab.com/gomidi/rtmididrv/imported/rtmidi/rtmidi_stub.cpp#L1 just fine then

[00:05:12] <Tv_> and what's different is that the include file just isn't found via the given -I?
[00:05:21] <Tv_> -> different build environment, different result?
[00:05:44] <preyalone> In terms of the build environment, I am using Go v1.17 in both cases. Same env vars, same flags.
[00:05:47] <preyalone> `go install ./...`
[00:06:35] <Tv_> -x will tell you what it's running
[00:06:41] <Tv_> the error comes from the C compiler

[00:26:31] <ikke> I didn't see the cpp dir in the vendored modules
[00:27:32] <preyalone> Why is `go mod vendor` not placing the same files where they need to be, compared with `go install -mod=mod`?
[00:29:51] <preyalone> Looks like Go 1.14 changed the behavior of go install. And cgo may not have been designed to handle native source files in subdirectories? https://github.com/golang/go/issues/26366#issuecomment-855419844

[00:32:16] <preyalone> maybe it's a zsh or WSL thing
[00:32:44] <Tv_> no, just your unfamiliarity with shell. order matters.

[03:09:28] <djo> I see!
[03:10:46] <b0nn> FTR because there is no information in the package on what new type you are instantiating,you need to convey that information yourself, and the name is the easiest place to do that
[03:11:24] <b0nn> I mean, unless you want people to read Documentation (gasp!) or the source code directly
[03:12:15] <djo> Understood!
[03:16:51] <djo> to go back to the flat directory structure layout (with multiple files) Do you confirm that there is no way in file stuff.go to know that func Bla is from bla.go right? (other than guessing that Bla will be logicially in file bla.go sine it's kind of the same name and the author is not a sychopath to store it elesewhere)

[10:15:00] <opcode> don't you think the salient bit is not the error in loadlocation?
[10:16:15] <bpalmer> I had ot manually check that to make sure it's not some consequence of .In() being handed an invalid location
[10:16:36] <bpalmer> So, yeah, I think that totally could have been an explanation
[10:16:55] <opcode> well given that it outputs the -05:00 you can tell it loads the location
[10:17:08] <opcode> in any case
[10:17:29] <opcode> is this a bug in the std library or am i doing something wrong with time.Time.Format()?

[14:04:27] <j416> usr123: I use the one which is more convenient for the given task. If I have a []byte I'll use json.Unmarshal. If I have an io.Reader I'll use json.Decoder.
[14:05:01] <j416> usr123: json.Decoder can stream-decode ndjson (http://ndjson.org/) nicely, too
[14:06:03] <usr123> j416: You mean if there is a response body that is streamed to me instead of all at once response, it's better to use json.Decode?
[14:06:16] <j416> usr123: could be.
[14:06:28] <usr123> Also in this code https://dpaste.org/cxEN#L8,14,16,17 (I'm reading a book called Go programming blueprints) Can someone please help me understand the request being formed here?
[14:07:08] <usr123> The options that are set as url.Values are they the url query params like ?foo=bar&baz=foo or are they request body like so: { "foo" : "bar" } ??
[14:07:27] <usr123> Because in the explanation they say that it's a post request and the url.Values are being sent as request body
[14:07:43] <j416> usr123: an easy way to check is to write a server that'll print that out
[14:07:58] <j416> usr123: https://requestbin.com/ or similar can also come in handy
[14:09:38] <usr123> j416: I'm planning to use httputil.DumpRequest for this. But since the program in not in decent shape to run as of now, I'm unable to dump the request and see for myself.
[14:09:44] <usr123> I could do it with some effort though.

[19:29:17] <mrig> I am getting this error or warning alot : use of `fmt.Printf` forbidden by pattern `^(fmt\.Print(|f|ln)|print|println)$` (forbidigo)
[19:31:19] <mrig> cant read it for the life of me :)
[19:32:36] <CommunistWolf> presumably wants  you to use log instead
[19:32:42] <ikke> ^fmt\.Print.*$ -- forbid use of Print statements because they are likely just for debugging
[19:32:45] <mrig> It is not signaling on all uses, but can't seem to figure out what is causing it.
[19:32:45] <ikke> meh
[19:32:52] <ikke> linters cannot now if it's used for debugging or not
[19:33:26] <CommunistWolf> you can disable lints you don't like

[22:11:54] <mrig> yes I've got the config file from the documentation, it is said that it has all of the configuration settings available on it. But this does not appear to be so, and even the doc of the linter that it is using does not have the command to turn off the particular rule that is irritating.
[22:13:03] <mrig> time to remove it again it would seem, got a little further than the last time though. Ill stick to using it for systematic checks from time to time rather than something that stays on.
