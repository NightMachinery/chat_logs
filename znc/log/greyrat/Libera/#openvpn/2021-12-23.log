[13:06:29] <UncleKiwi> well I have just got back from the supermarket 
[13:08:04] <UncleKiwi> and I would like to figure out now how to get a certain device to connec to my openvpn server
[13:08:13] <UncleKiwi> it must be possible
[13:31:08] <ordex> what's the error you get now?
[13:31:12] <ordex> (client and server)
[13:37:12] <UncleKiwi> i'll check ordex
[13:40:26] <UncleKiwi> I cant seem to be able to get the client logs 
[13:40:40] <UncleKiwi> because its a VoIP device 
[13:40:48] <UncleKiwi> cant seem to get to the openvpn logs
[13:43:46] <ordex> so you see no error on the phone?
[13:43:53] <ordex> just "can't connect" basically?
[13:43:57] <ordex> well, the server log may help
[13:44:03] <ordex> ensure verb is set to 4 in the confi

[13:55:01] <ordex> have you already tried setting tls-version-min 1.0 ?
[13:55:07] <ordex> and see if the error changed?
[13:55:14] <UncleKiwi> yep
[13:55:20] <ordex> no change?
[13:55:32] <ordex> can you post the full log on some pastebin service, please?
[13:55:33] <UncleKiwi> if i dont do that - I get warnings telling me to do that 
[13:55:37] <ordex> ok
[14:06:13] <UncleKiwi> https://paste.debian.net/hidden/e790680c/
[14:08:55] <ordex> hm ok
[14:08:59] <ordex> not informative at all
[14:09:09] <ordex> why using tcp and not udp?
[14:09:14] <ordex> just wondering if that can make any difference
[14:09:26] <UncleKiwi> because I tried udp first 
[14:09:30] <UncleKiwi> and was trying tcp 
[14:09:55] <UncleKiwi> could it be to do with limits of ciphers ? 
[14:10:22] <UncleKiwi> is there I way to get the server to operate in like the least restrictive way 
[14:11:17] <ordex> mah, this error is about openssl and the TLS session. this is unrelated to the openvpn cipher of choice
[14:11:20] <UncleKiwi> i was reading documenations about how to seup the client for this vopi device and they dont actually specify a cipher 
[14:11:27] <UncleKiwi> ah ok 
[14:11:29] <UncleKiwi> right
[14:11:38] <UncleKiwi> so what could be the issue
[14:11:39] <ordex> once they both operate with tls-1.0, they should be able to talk
[14:11:47] <ordex> unless there is some bug on the ssl library on the phone
[14:12:02] <UncleKiwi> yeah 
[14:12:07] <UncleKiwi> maybe
[14:12:07] <ordex> well, as last resort you could do a traffic dump
[14:12:09] <ordex> with tcpdum
[14:12:12] <ordex> tcpdump*
[14:12:23] <ordex> and see the TLS handshake - maybe the packets carry some more meaningful reason
[14:12:27] <UncleKiwi> on server 
[14:12:31] <ordex> even though may not be easy to look inside
[14:12:37] <ordex> but it's an attempt
[14:12:53] <UncleKiwi> could it me my certs
[14:13:11] <UncleKiwi> they seem fine on other devices
[14:13:33] <UncleKiwi> i tried other voip phones and there was no issue
[14:13:57] <UncleKiwi> maybe i can change the ssl version on the server 
[14:14:01] <UncleKiwi> how easy is it to do that 
[14:14:21] <ordex> mah, might be quite difficult depending on your distro
[14:14:32] <UncleKiwi> debian
[14:15:14] <ordex> dunno - maybe you can install openssl 1.0.2 from some backport repo
[14:15:15] <ordex> no clue
[14:15:22] <ordex> but this is just a guess
[14:15:27] <ordex> maybe the phone is buggy and just won't work
[14:15:35] <UncleKiwi> maybe 
[14:15:37] <UncleKiwi> maybe
[14:15:42] <ordex> one next step might be to find out where the log on the phone is
[14:15:52] <ordex> maybe you can connect with some serial console and look at some output
[14:16:02] <UncleKiwi> ithat would be handy 
[14:16:06] <ordex> yap
[14:16:13] <UncleKiwi> its an i12 fanvil
[14:16:13] <ordex> because now we are shooting in the dark as to what the issue might be
[14:16:41] <ordex> that seems an intercom?

[14:21:16] <crandon> Hi! I'm experiencing a strange issue on a raspberry PI (latest raspbian release (bullseye)): my wifi gets disconnected every once in a while and if so, my VPN connection drops (naturally), but it never manages to recover. What I see from the client logs: "TLS key negotiation failed to occur within 60 seconds". My guess is, that the connection can not be established as the restart of the wifi interface eliminates the route towards the
[14:21:16] <crandon> VPN server via the LAN GW and as the default route via the tunnel is still there the connection to the server is attempted via the (non functional) tunnel itself. Adding the route manually or restarting the client solves the problem.
[14:22:00] <crandon> using tcp/udp is not making a difference.
[14:22:46] <crandon> What I'd need is to enforce the client to readd the static route for the server once it notices the server is not reachable.
[14:24:41] <ordex> crandon: that's not possible - ideally the route should be re-added by whoever is removing it in the first place
[14:24:53] <ordex> from the openvpn perspective the route was added, so it's expected to be there
[14:25:16] <ordex> crandon: if you remove persist-tun from your config, this behaviour should change as the tun interface is shut down when the VPN drops

[14:30:37] <crandon> ordex: it seems, that the whole usb wifi dongle gets disconnected (I have no idea why), so I guess there's no way dhcpcd could readd the route, just by 'remembering'. Another workaround would be to 'hardcode' the static route into dhcpcd, but beside being ugly it would require config changes whenever the raspberry is moved to a different network.

[14:33:06] <crandon> Sorry, the wording was misleading: the disconnection happens on USB level (and Wifi level disconnection is only a consequence of that)
