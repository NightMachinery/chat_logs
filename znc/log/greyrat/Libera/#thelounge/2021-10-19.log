[00:01:13] <johncs> it's at least reproducible in the initial commit that introduces dragging (by just removing the code that disables the context menu for android). which is good, because I'm just going to cut out pieces of that commit until I find the offender
[00:03:18] <Activ8> do we need a right click menu? could it not stay with the 3 dots at the top? or a new menu button somewhere rather than right click? I'm just throwing ideas around.  I don't think I would miss the right click even on my laptop as I use the 3 dots anyway
[00:03:31] <Activ8> I think a lot of people would use the right click though I would assume.

[00:07:15] <johncs> Ha, found it. It's a sortablejs upstream issue, or at least strongly related to something up there. Gotta get to some other things but I'll start hunting for a workaround and a fix for sortablejs (or maybe sortable-vue... but prolly the former). If `touch-start-threshold` is removed the bug vanishes.
[00:08:20] <Activ8> I think still waiting for sortablejs to do something on one of your commits, that's not relating to it is it?
[00:11:20] <johncs> no that's upgrading the sortablejs dependency in sortable-vue, which we're not actually waiting on them for since we can force yarn to use the new sortablejs ourselves
[00:11:42] <Activ8> yeh

[02:01:16] <johncs> MaxLeiter, bookworm: didn't ping either of you before but probably wise to do. I came up with a design for topic expansion, will implement before long if no one has complaints with the proposed interface: https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/issues/276#issuecomment-945080301
[02:03:24] <bookworm> johncs: I personally don't like the phone version that uses an additional line for the topic. The screen is small enough as is and I'd rather read the messages. Any reason we can't leave it where it is now and expand it below when you click on it?
[02:06:45] <johncs> I don't feel too starved for vertical space in the current UI personally
[02:07:12] <johncs> But I wanted to avoid the issue where the topic is completely hidden if the channel name is long enough (or just _really_ small)
[02:07:39] <johncs> And moving the text away from the user when they touch it seems unideal
[02:07:46] <bookworm> the channel names can't be that large
[02:08:00] <johncs> I think your screen is wider than mine bookworm
[02:08:07] <bookworm> that may be
[02:08:15] <johncs> I can send you a screenshot if you'd like, but I think it's easy to imagine
[02:08:31] <johncs> Plus phones come in all sorts of sizes
[02:08:33] <bookworm> but in the end you want to read the messages, not the topic
[02:09:00] <johncs> This is about tradeoffs, I understand the messages are more important than the topic
[02:09:05] <bookworm> the topic is usually nice if you enter for the first time or if you need a link from it, but generally it's in the way
[02:09:23] <bookworm> especially if you also hit the show more messages button
[02:09:32] <bookworm> that moves the thing *again* further down
[02:09:40] <bookworm> granted, usually temporary but still
[02:09:49] <johncs> more messages button? I don't know what feature you're referencing
[02:10:06] <johncs> And I regularly want to click links in a topic or copy from it
[02:10:13] <johncs> It's very challenging to do that in a channel right now
[02:10:17] <johncs> Honestly I just go to my computer when I have to
[02:10:20] <Activ8> you would lose a lot of space if it's a long topic
[02:10:30] <johncs> Check out the design activ8
[02:10:32] <Activ8> click to expand would be lovely
[02:10:33] <johncs> we're talking about one line only
[02:10:38] <bookworm> https://labrat.space/irc/a56ac9627ae0633c/Screenshot_20211019-004008.png
[02:10:57] <johncs> Oh interesting, I've never seen that button
[02:11:05] <johncs> I thin kI have my client load a lot of messages immediately
[02:11:07] <bookworm> well, I frequently browse IRC with my phone, I don't always have access to a computer
[02:11:25] <johncs> Right, in such a case I would be hosed
[02:11:27] <bookworm> it depends on if you have the join / parts etc messages active and how busy the channel is
[02:11:28] <johncs> That's why I want to allow this on mobile
[02:12:10] <bookworm> I like the expand feature, I really do. I would just like it to stay in the same place where it is now
[02:12:17] <Activ8> if you want to see the topic though you just type /topic and it appears
[02:12:25] <bookworm> moving really isn't a problem, could always animate it to guide the user
[02:12:47] <johncs> ha neat, I didn't know that Activ8, that's a great workaround for the current situation
[02:13:16] <Activ8> I just noticed something, it's not in the guide
[02:13:22] <bookworm> that was one of the original ideas actually, to just spam /topic if you click on it
[02:13:34] <Activ8> the guide I mean when clicking on ?
[02:13:48] <Activ8> I get a guide how to change the topic
[02:13:57] <Activ8> but that's no good to me if I'm not op 
[02:14:07] <bookworm> heh? what are you talking about?
[02:14:31] <bookworm> /topic certainly is in the help section if that's what you mean `/topic [newtopic]`
[02:14:52] <Activ8> should it not just be /topic
[02:14:58] <bookworm> no?
[02:15:18] <Activ8> no? why I can't set topics I'm not a mod.  oh wait
[02:15:19] <bookworm> the brackets denote an optional parameter... the text next to it explains the different modes
[02:15:41] <bookworm> as in /topic gives you back the topic, /topic $new sets the topic to $new
[02:16:03] <bookworm> that's how it works on several irc commands actually. Quite a bunch is overloaded like that
[02:16:07] <Activ8> ... /topic [newtopic] - Get the topic in the current channel. If newtopic is specified, sets the topic in the current channel.
[02:16:20] <bookworm> yes
[02:16:29] <Activ8> I understand the [new topic] is just optional for admins/ops
[02:16:39] <Activ8> I see I see
[02:17:16] <Activ8> makes sense, perfect
[02:22:27] <Activ8> https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/issues/4336 - John, who has channel names that long in reality? lol
[02:22:59] <johncs> Haha that's about the max length for demo purposes. You can get there with more realistic names though
[02:23:41] <johncs> I could make it so that touching the channel name expands the topic (probably a good idea in either case really), but I don't like that for long channel names there might be no hint at all in the UI that you can show the topic that way
[02:23:44] <bookworm> considering that IRC has a 512 char line limit and that includes user / nick / host / tags etc you're gonna have a bad time if you do that though
[02:23:48] <Activ8> I don't think I have ever seen a channel with more than two words with a hyphen in it
[02:24:49] <bookworm> ah, nevermind. Tags are excluded
[02:25:06] <bookworm> gives you an additional ~8k bytes
[02:25:51] <Activ8> hehe
[02:28:07] <johncs> this is a bit silly, there's really a lot of screen sizes

[02:32:11] <johncs> Yeah that editor needs some love üòÖ
[02:33:17] <bookworm> considering that we have the channel name in the text input field I think we can get away with truncating it a bit more aggressively 
[02:33:33] <johncs> yeah of course, easy to fix really

[03:04:57] <bookworm> yes for Android, no for iOS
[03:05:34] <bookworm> well, "kinda" would be the actual answer, you can use znc with its push module in front

[03:06:38] <johncs> I guess we're probably all using the lounge so if there's a bug with it we're all seeing it üòÖ
[03:07:15] <bookworm> I don't see the scrollback from our recent topic discussion, there's something fishy with the better-sqlite PR
[03:07:41] <johncs> oo rad, i'm glad you're dogfooding it too
[03:07:49] <johncs> seemed like the only way to shake out bugs was with a bunch of real testing
[03:07:57] <bookworm> indeed
[03:08:03] <bookworm> hence the dogfooding
[03:08:12] <johncs> MaxLeiter: bookworm is correct, my pitch was to have a row dedicated to the topic at all times.
[03:08:26] <johncs> With additional rows visible on expansion
[03:08:59] <johncs> But trying to keep the footprint of the header the same when not-expanded seems worth trying

[03:10:35] <Activ8> I kid I would hate to see a auto scrolling topic lol

[03:12:53] <johncs> mines set to 10k
[03:13:40] <bookworm> the "fetch more messages" button? that's due to me hiding join / parts but wanting kick / ban

[03:22:48] <bookworm> ah, right... we binary blob

[03:38:15] <bookworm> not sure bundling everything is the solution though

[03:48:34] <bookworm> sorting ints the wrong way sounds like an env problem all right
[03:48:59] <bookworm> but do keep in mind that any arch not supported with the pre-built binaries will fallback to a from source build, hitting just that
[03:50:03] <johncs> the fallback might just need to be adjusted, i'm guessing it's just that we have to tell npm to build better-sqlite in the right way
[03:50:08] <johncs> but i dunno
[03:50:15] <johncs> don't know what's wrong yet
[03:50:32] <bookworm> wait, wait, wait... you flipped the effing conditional in your PR did yah? Or did you double flip and it should be ok again?
[03:50:40] <johncs> double flip
[03:50:50] <johncs> we got it from sqlite the wrong way
[03:50:53] <johncs> then reversed it in memory
[03:50:54] <bookworm> do we have the case that some message shuffling doesn't work in that order?
[03:50:55] <johncs> now we ask for it the right way
[03:51:00] <bookworm> say, truncation?
[03:52:01] <bookworm> the client overrides the messages array by truncation... if you flip the conditional that won't do the same thing
[03:52:19] <bookworm> you'd erase the new messages, rather than the old ones no?
[03:52:39] <bookworm> then again, that's a sleepy me guessing based on having read the code quite a while ago
[03:52:43] <johncs> i don't know the code you're talking about
[03:52:59] <johncs> but that sounds like a reasonable guess
[03:53:05] <johncs> wouldn't explain the env differences very well
[03:53:09] <johncs> though
[03:53:37] <bookworm> it only triggers if you actually manage to overflow the array, but right that does seem like a flag that I am wrong
[03:54:18] <johncs> ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è it's a weird issue, i don't see why even a different sqlite binary would result in what we're seeing, since sqlite is such a stable thing
[03:54:24] <johncs> so it's a reasonable guess
[03:55:39] <bookworm> johncs: src/client.js:512

[04:01:02] <bookworm> hm, might be wrong
[04:01:10] <bookworm> In any case... /me bed
[04:01:14] <johncs> search results actually leave the sqlite backend in a different order
[04:01:34] <johncs> but the getMessages function did the reversing within itself, so it's giving the same results as normal
[04:01:35] <bookworm> more isn't search afaik?
[04:01:55] <johncs> i think it's eventually calling to getMesssages, yeah

[04:26:31] <johncs> very hard to believe that's been working at all honestly
[04:26:37] <linguist> Heyy... I happened to notice that thelounge doesn't have a /notify command... Isn't there support for that? 
[04:26:48] <johncs> there's something quite wrong with our tests I'm guessing
[04:26:58] <bookworm> well you only notice if your scrollback is larger than $limit
[04:27:00] <johncs> orrrr we're wrong again and that's not the problem üòÜ

[04:27:16] <johncs> oh I see, yeah that makes sense
[04:27:31] <bookworm> linguist: I guess you are the person who also opened the issue?
[04:27:34] <johncs> the limits are so big
[04:27:38] <bookworm> if so look at it
[04:28:12] <johncs> linguist: what bookworm's talking about, in case you didn't https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/issues/4335
[04:28:13] <linguist> bookworm: no, I'm not
[04:28:27] <linguist> I'll take a look, thanks!
[04:28:28] <bookworm> strange coincidence them
[04:29:22] <linguist> Well, I rarely use notify TBH, but today I wanted to add a person who often send messages of my interest 
[04:29:53] <johncs> linguist: what do you expect notify to do? I saw some differences in what it means
[04:29:59] <bookworm> if you don't feel like opening a PR / writing a plugin there's the option to use znc
[04:30:18] <johncs> The MONITOR feature I mention would only tell you when someone comes online/offline
[04:31:30] <linguist> johncs: well, I precisely expect to be notified when the person comes online/offline
[04:31:55] <linguist> Some IRC clients have a way to see the current status of the person
[04:33:50] <linguist> Interesting, I knew it was something done through the server but seems simpler than I thought... It would work if I just quote the command to the server, right?
[04:34:09] <linguist> I mean, as a temporary workaround
[04:34:16] <bookworm> yes I think?

[04:34:24] <bookworm> assuming there's no handler for it
[04:34:46] <bookworm> could be that the reply gets swallowed by irc-framework
[04:34:54] <bookworm> (or TL for that matter)

[04:35:05] <linguist> I'll make a test and add some of you 
[04:36:07] <johncs> linguist: I tried that myself and couldn't get it working :(
[04:36:51] <johncs> I think the replies come in a little special and the lounge or our underlying IRC framework doesn't treat them as messages
[04:37:22] <bookworm> it gets swallowed by the framework
[04:37:47] <bookworm> TL doesn't listen for the event that gets emitted by it, hence you don't see a reply
[04:38:02] <bookworm> as there is no handler attached
[04:39:14] <linguist> Ohhh, I see... I think it would be interesting to quote unhandled messages from the server into the status (though I love the fact that thelounge's status is very clean)
[04:40:26] <johncs> There's a debug option that sort of does that. I do wonder if there's an alright way to do that by default though. I'd guess that there'd be quite a lot of spam, but maybe there really wouldn't be.
[04:44:13] <bookworm> we do listen for unknown events... the problem is events that are parsed by irc-fw but not within TL
[04:44:19] <bookworm> in this case https://github.com/kiwiirc/irc-framework/blob/a43568830315e3f561377ff11f892f5665f40fa3/src/commands/handlers/user.js#L383

[05:28:57] <linguist> I'm still trying to grasp thelounge's structure... So, when irc-fw calls emit, is it going to send the event to a callback or something like that that needs to be written? 
[05:32:54] <johncs> TBH I haven't worked with that part of the code yet. But I might be helpful anyways.
[05:33:25] <johncs> The various modules in irc-events are doing most of the handling of irc-framework's events I think
[05:34:47] <johncs> (If you're unfamiliar with node's event emitters in general, that might be a good thing to do a quick read on first)
[05:35:39] <johncs> But yes, you'll essentially just write a callback in The Lounge's codebase (likely in irc-events) that handles the event

[05:53:18] <johncs> ah, I now know why
[05:53:32] <johncs> prefetchMaxSearchSize
[05:53:50] <johncs> "This value sets the maximum request size made to find the Open Graph tags for link previews. For some sites like YouTube this can easily exceed 300 kilobytes."
[05:54:22] <johncs> It's set to 50kb by default. So it seems like you could up that to get previews.
[05:54:56] <johncs> Though I'm a little confused about the wording there... I think it probably means maximum response size
[05:55:20] <johncs> But I don't understand why that would be a problem, especially since you could probably stream the data ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. More to this story I'm sure.
[05:57:45] <johncs> Ah yes, some code diving confirms its the response size. And the response is fully loaded up into memory and only then processed. So you just need to consider your available memory when upping that value.

[15:04:54] <Restore> : Unsupported file ./thelounge.deb given on commandline is my current error after giving it the `sudo apt install ./thelounge.deb` command, This is a aws ubuntu 20.04 after i installed node.js current release
[15:06:21] <Restore> I figure this issue is somewhat common?
[15:07:04] <bookworm> not that I know no
[15:07:29] <Restore> perhaps I have made a mistake installing node.js?
[15:08:09] <Activ8> do you have a screenshot Restore?
[15:08:46] <bookworm> why would you need a screenshot from a text error?
[15:08:49] <Restore> Im afraid not. AWS remote instant shows my and the servers ip when logged on
[15:09:06] <Restore> `node --version`  shows `v16.11.1`
[15:11:03] <Activ8> save that file in the home drive and run it again, for example "sudo apt install /home/user/thelounge_4.2.0_all.deb", you are installing 4.2.0 right?
[15:11:12] <Activ8> bookworm I just like screenshots :P

[20:01:40] <Activ8> cool two of the plugins are not using thelounge-plugin for tags so linking to plugins would mean people creating the plugins need to add thelounge-plugin for it to be available. i.e https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:thelounge-plugin
[20:02:15] <bookworm> duds-: word of advice, set /umode +R, preferably in the on connect settings of the network, it helps
[20:02:52] <bookworm> I'm fairly sure that can be addressed
[20:02:56] <Activ8> unless - add a new category under https://thelounge.chat/docs for plugins specifically and then mention the plugins page under there.
[20:03:19] <Activ8> maybe under usage? https://thelounge.chat/docs/usage
[20:03:36] <bookworm> same level as the themes now
[20:04:15] <Activ8> got ya, just a question does minidiggers shortcuts plugin need to be installed bfore another plugin or is the plugins completely seperate
[20:04:32] <bookworm> all of them are completely separate
[20:04:35] <Activ8> fab
[20:05:03] <bookworm> if they need deps, they can specify as much in the package.json file
[20:18:01] <Activ8> yeh I noticed deps section when I did my themes to npm

[22:13:22] <duds-> Activ8, bookworm, sorry for the late response, thank you both :)
[22:17:47] <Activ8> duds- I noticed there wasn't even a secion on the website in regards to plugins.  Hopefully there's more to come!  That's why I wanted the edits to include plugins.
[22:18:10] <bookworm> there is, very, very barebones, but there is :P
[22:18:12] <Activ8> secion, section*
[22:18:34] <Activ8> there is? I checked everywhere.  Show me plz üòÉ

[22:20:44] <Activ8> Do you envisage plugins becoming popular?  The ones created are great so far!
[22:21:56] <Activ8> plugins open a massive benefit I think and to have it in an API even better!

[23:20:58] <johncs> MaxLeiter: you mentioned auto light/dark switching wouldn't work well with our theme picker in #4165, what did you mean by that?
[23:20:58] <thelounge-bot> 07¬ª 04Closed issue 12#4165 - Automatic light/dark theme based on OS settings https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/issues/4165
[23:21:38] <MaxLeiter> we'd just need a new `use system settings` option
[23:22:09] <MaxLeiter> it wouldn't work well with our current system due to syncing settings 
[23:25:14] <johncs> What's the syncing issue? I'm not familiar with the theming code. Naively I could imagine optionally choosing a theme for dark/light mode each, and then the frontend client could grab the one based on its context.

[23:30:37] <MaxLeiter> Just that we currently sync the selected theme across clients, so a user could select morning on one and have it switched to default without specifying it on that client 
[23:31:02] <MaxLeiter> i dont remember why i closed the issue, but as I said, the system toggle as a theme option would fix it (if we treat morning = dark and default = light)
