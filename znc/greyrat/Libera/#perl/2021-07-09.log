[00:00:03] <daemon> I like to believe perl is a lot closer to its c-underpinnings and can infact work in far more tight and awkward situations than either python or php
[00:00:04] <Grinnz> the differences between python and perl are largely semantics and ecosystem
[00:00:11] <mst> nirnam: cpython is a bytecode VM, not much different than the perl optree system
[00:00:13] <Grinnz> they're both rather equally capable
[00:00:18] <The_Blode> I actually like Perl over Python as I like Perl's structure
[00:00:24] <mst> The_Blode: right, same here
[00:00:27] <mjgardner> Python is less expressive and therefore easier to learn and manage.
[00:00:46] <mst> daemon: something that always made me laugh my arse off
[00:00:48] <nirnam> it is easier to teach that's for sure
[00:01:01] <mst> daemon: slashdot posting 'netcraft confirms: perl/bsd is dying'
[00:01:09] <nirnam> teacher want some thing that fixes, imagine have to grade code with more than one way to do it
[00:01:25] <Grinnz> imagine having to know the language you're teaching
[00:01:25] <ingy> I still own pyrl.org if anyone wants it ;)
[00:01:29] <mjgardner> Managers prefer fungible employees they can shuffle around. A language where there’s only one way to do things enables that.
[00:01:34] <The_Blode> I didn't know Perl was embedded in vital components of technology
[00:01:34] <ingy> I think I do anyway
[00:02:01] <nirnam> Grinnz: that's another python thing, a good python programmer didn't even have to be programmer
[00:02:01] <mst> daemon: meanwhile, slashdot is written in perl, and netcraft uses perl and freebsd
[00:02:11] <ehuelsmann[m]> mjgardner: a good engineer masters more than one language
[00:02:15] <daemon> mst, so all we need is the netflix documentary (also entirely BSD) :P
[00:02:39] <The_Blode> OpenSSL is the tecnology used to encrypt Internet communications?
[00:02:48] <Grinnz> one of them
[00:02:54] <ehuelsmann[m]> mjgardner: managers should prefer those
[00:02:55] <mjgardner> ehuelsmann[m]: Managers don’t want good engineers. They want the aforementioned cheap juniors out of bootcamp.
[00:02:59] <mst> The_Blode: yes. also postgresql relies on perl for a bunch of stuff. as do debian and ubuntu.
[00:02:59] <daemon> mst, it seems to me everything that has died or is dying seems to be the underpinning of the modern information tech world :)
[00:03:24] <mst> daemon: yes, I've often joked that if something hasn't been declared dying yet, it probably isn't stable enough to use for baseline ops work

[00:10:04] <The_Blode> Grinnz: thank you
[00:10:26] <Grinnz> it stalled on 5 because they tried to make perl 6 for 20 years, and recently realized they were making a new language so perl can use 7 now
[00:10:26] <furrymcgee> do you know some real life use cases of ExtUtils::Perl?
[00:10:47] <mjgardner> It stayed at 5 and we just iterated on the minor version number. There haven’t been any world-shaking changes and Raku sat on the Perl 6 name for a long while.
[00:10:57] <Grinnz> (drastically simplified, there was lots of unfun drama)

[01:26:45] <simcop2387> might move one of my other windows vm setups onto this vlan so i can have an amd64 one too
[01:27:16] <thowe> The_Blode: to answer your question, I would say FreeBSD (and the other BSDs as well) are often more friendly by way of being better documented.  Want to know how something works?  The man pages actually tell you.  Also, there aren't a bunch of competing systems fighting over network setting, etc...
[01:27:31] <simcop2387> nirnam: it's running ok but i would never recommend it on a pi4.  you don't get wifi, you don't get 3d video, you don't get ethernet, you don't get a lot of things.

[21:30:52] <choroba> I'm not sure you always want to remove the trailing spaces from a HERE doc etc.
