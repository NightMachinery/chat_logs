[10:45:23] <icrbow[m]> wow, it really stays readable until tiniest of scales
[10:46:32] <icrbow[m]> * readable until the tiniest of
[10:49:33] <sudoreboot> Oh cool, the upper case letters are rendered in bold
[10:58:25] <sudoreboot> Unfortunately not very good for powerline symbols

[11:10:17] <icrbow[m]> https://www.gridsagegames.com/blog/2014/09/fonts-in-roguelikes/ ðŸ¤”
[11:13:09] <ManofLetters[m]> actually, the three alternative map fonts I use in Allure of the Stars are square, as well, they are just not readable, by a common opinion of players

[11:14:54] <ManofLetters[m]> especially scaled down ^^^
[11:15:16] <sudoreboot> Does look a bit stretched I suppose
[11:15:37] * ManofLetters[m] uploaded an image: (40KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/mozilla.org/cccad0474859dbfd16d2b4336aeb2c24ef7c3539/Angband.Ultimate.png >
[11:16:39] <ManofLetters[m]> actually, all three of them are now available in Angband (the venerable roguelike still in development after so many decades) ^^^
[11:17:41] <sudoreboot> What "square" does well is making use of the entire block
[11:18:42] <sudoreboot> It tends to look a little horizontally stretched when the lower case letters don't fill the vertical space as much as capitals
[11:19:32] <ManofLetters[m]> yeah, the trick of using only capital letters makes sense
[11:19:42] <ManofLetters[m]> very good readability
[11:19:58] <ManofLetters[m]> but also a very hard time telling a capital letter from a non-capital letter
[11:20:19] <ManofLetters[m]> which is a bummer for a game where b is a bat, but B is the Barlog
[11:20:53] <ManofLetters[m]> which is probably why I skipped the font years ago, when searching in vain
[11:21:28] <sudoreboot> Yeah the visibility of bold varies a lot with size/resolution. Tends to not work for smaller sizes on my monitor

[11:22:07] <ManofLetters[m]> and when you have a bright blue 'b' vs dark blue B...
[11:25:25] <ManofLetters[m]> but for roguelikes that only use capital letters, I guess it's perfect
[11:25:43] <sudoreboot> Wonder if it could be remedied by using the lower case characters but equal in size to the upper case ones, probably with some extra differentiation for those that are too similar to their upper case equivalent
[11:26:18] <sudoreboot> (such as p and P)
[11:26:49] <sudoreboot> (or o and O, the obvious ones)
[11:27:13] <ManofLetters[m]> how would make 'b' equal in size to 'B'?
[11:28:08] <sudoreboot> Perhaps by making it look more like `lO` or something
[11:28:56] <ManofLetters[m]> hmm, interesting, could work
[11:28:59] <ManofLetters[m]> how about 'h'?
[11:29:44] <ManofLetters[m]> f? k? l? t?

[12:00:40] <sudoreboot> Just a few examples
[12:03:26] <ManofLetters[m]> yay, that could really work; you basically move the line (I don't remember the jargon name) that tops the circles in b, d, etc., to the very top and then on details to differenciate, e.g., h from n
[12:04:27] <ManofLetters[m]> you will probably make the lower parts of y, g., etc., very small, as in my font --- or would you move them all the way up, so that they start at the bottom flush with capital letters?
[12:05:53] <sudoreboot> I would probably take the first approach; make lower case letters gravitate towards the bottom
[12:06:59] <ManofLetters[m]> I didn't get it?
[12:07:00] <sudoreboot> Or else keep lower case letters vertically centred (in terms of filled area distribution) and move the lower case up
[12:07:20] <ManofLetters[m]> ok, fine
[12:07:21] <sudoreboot> sudoreboot: I mean like the K in the sample I made
[12:07:59] <ManofLetters[m]> sure, looks fine, but y, g, p, etc., extend below capital letters and I wondered about that
[12:08:13] <sudoreboot> Ah, that
[12:08:47] <ManofLetters[m]> which much of a reason letters are normally not square
[12:09:05] <sudoreboot> They don't have to extend below to be recognisable, I think?
[12:09:10] <ManofLetters[m]> yeah
[12:09:45] <ManofLetters[m]> anyway, a bunch of great ideas; next time I make a font, I will revisit these and perhaps ask for advice :)
[12:10:01] <ManofLetters[m]> but making a scalable font is so much work..
[12:11:01] <ManofLetters[m]> I wonder, how much the lack of readabilitiy of my font is related to "lower case letters look stretched"
[12:11:03] <sudoreboot> Don't rely on my advice, I'm ignorant and uninformed ðŸ˜…
[12:11:12] <ManofLetters[m]> noted :D
[12:11:22] <ManofLetters[m]> I'm an amateur, as well
[12:11:41] <ManofLetters[m]> such people change the world, because they don't know it's not possible ;)
[12:12:48] <sudoreboot> That's my go-to consolation philosophy as well! Sometimes known frameworks need to be tested and it takes a fresh mind to properly do so
