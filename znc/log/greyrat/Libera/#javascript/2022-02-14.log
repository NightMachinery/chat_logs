[03:42:18] <sheetjs> deno is just mature enough to be useful, has some strategic advantages in terms of not having to learn node stuff, and is early enough to be a land grab of sorts
[03:42:34] <Maxdamantus> Might also be worth pointing out that "governments" (at least democratic ones, so arguably not the US) are generally subject to the desires of the people that are electing them, so it's not just a matter of "government" vs the population which wants to use crypto.
[03:42:46] <KevinX> they will add support for node packages soon too

[03:46:44] <sheetjs> node Buffer readUInt16LE reads better
[03:46:59] <sheetjs> also, Buffer has a lot of the DataView API built in, no need to shuffle back and forth
[03:47:09] <wroathe> Maxdamantus: Right, but the flaw in that logic is the notion that taxes are some kind of unwanted tyranny. Granted, most people would prefer less taxation, but people also rely heavily on the services that taxation provides from the government. The government's digital currency of the future may very well be based on some crypto tech, but ultimately there will never be a mandate from the people to

[04:08:35] <KevinX> the whole nft art scene is weird
[04:09:38] <KevinX> I've read NFTs would be good for other things though, like keeping a record of food transfers along the supply chain, or even like a home or car title

[04:11:45] <wroathe> KevinX: Yeah, that's just accounting generally, and we've been able to do that with computers since the 70s.
[04:11:51] <ThePendulum> do you know anyone who had to or failed to prove they own a house or a car?
[04:11:59] <ThePendulum> *had to and failed
[04:12:14] <ThePendulum> (that they did actually own)
[04:12:23] <ljharb> happens all the time, if they lose the deed or title
[04:12:33] *** Joins: llorllale (~llorllale@198.98.119.85)
[04:13:23] <KevinX> it's mostly about the decentralized nature of it all, instead of it being on some random government windows ME server that gets ransomeware on it
[04:13:49] <ThePendulum> it also wouldn't prove you own the house, because you can't put a building on the blockchain, only a hash representing a house, which that needs to be associated with the actual house by a traditional database or logic
[04:14:25] <sheetjs> this is why the ethereum hard fork was so controversial
[04:14:31] <KevinX> yeah there'd have to be some protocol for it
[04:15:16] <ThePendulum> a blockchain isn't necessarily decentralized, they just generally are, they don't really help with that

[04:16:31] <wroathe> And the ransomware example you cited is more about people just generally being stupid and not building any kind of redundancy into their mission critical systems
[04:17:00] <KevinX> that's a side effect though, and a common one
[04:17:06] <ljharb> ThePendulum: right but once that association exists, then the hash has value.
[04:17:15] <ljharb> that’s also how normal money works
[04:17:59] <ThePendulum> ljharb: but the whole promise is that this makes it somehow inherently valuable and provable
[04:18:12] <ThePendulum> that this is better than money and contracts

[04:18:58] <ljharb> nothing has inherent value
[04:19:51] <KevinX> the dollar really only has value because the USA military backs it.

[08:15:48] <bobdobbs> Hi all. I'm (still) learning React. I'm starting to look at the
[08:15:48] <bobdobbs>            useState hook and trying to understand this snippet:
[08:15:48] <bobdobbs>            http://pastie.org/p/0LXP7aYp90wTT1BQUnFVzZ
[08:15:54] <bobdobbs> whoops. sorry.
[08:16:38] <bobdobbs> Specifically, I'm trying to understand what setState is about. If I understand line 4, then the function 'setState' is being pulled out of 'useState' and being copied as 'setCount'. Am I right about that?
[08:17:12] <bobdobbs> My understanding is partially informed by the useState documentation:  https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate

[08:25:39] <copier_> if someone recommends a framework i'll scream
[08:25:52] <copier_> but is there a way in modern js to essentially create a bunch of reusable components
[08:26:23] <copier_> say i've wanted to make a site in which everyone's drivers license was generated from a big array of arrays, each array having the relevant data in blobform
[08:26:53] <copier_> do i just need to make these things in some big for loop and then appendchild over and over? seems easy enough actually
[08:26:56] <copier_> maybe i'll just do that
[08:27:27] <copier_> sad it's not a bit more coupled for the sake of modification; i guess i could add a little button for add and delete

[08:46:48] <onosendi> bobdobbs: `useState` returns an array. The first item in the array is the current state. The second item is a function to set the state. When the state changes, the component is re-rendered.

[08:48:31] <onosendi> bobdobbs: the `[state, setState] = useState()` syntax is just destructuring the array that's returned. You can name them whatever you want: `[foo, bar] = useState()`, where `foo` is the current state, and `bar` set's the current state.

[08:57:57] <bobdobbs> hai onosendi
[08:58:50] <bobdobbs> onosendi: cool. What you are telling me suggests that I (at least kinda) understand the docs
[08:59:49] <bobdobbs> onosendi: what I don't understand is the setState/setCount part
[09:00:19] <onosendi> bobdobbs: what don't you understand about it?
[09:00:39] <bobdobbs> onosendi: I mean, how does setCount know what to do? After all, the state passed in could be anything, and there are a zillion possible ways to change the state
[09:01:15] <bobdobbs> Or is setState a kind of "abstract interface" that gets defined... however?
[09:04:13] <KevinX> https://javascript.info/destructuring-assignment
[09:04:26] <bobdobbs> KevinX: is that for me?
[09:04:48] <KevinX> Yeah, you pick the names so you can use setCount or setPotato if you want
[09:05:09] <KevinX> The convention though is [something, setSomething]
[09:05:14] <bobdobbs> ok
[09:05:28] <bobdobbs> now, that much I think I understand
[09:05:30] <KevinX> But you could put anything in there, like [a, b]

[23:43:03] <ljharb> stenno: i mean, the easy way is to just replace the builtin method with one that tracks its usage
[23:43:26] <blueagain> ljharb: I guess. Just saying it boils down to opinion. You could theoretically have a super-minimal core and everything as modules. The node path is an opinion.
[23:43:40] <stenno> i mean that its difficult to get a list of actually deprecated syntax
[23:44:20] <ljharb> blueagain: sure. but things being opinions doesn't mean they're exempt from being objectively better or worse.
[23:44:30] <ljharb> stenno: API isn't syntax
[23:44:37] <ljharb> stenno: and deprecated methods can be parsed out of the spec itself
[23:45:00] <blueagain> ljharb: agreed. I'm just saying it's not all that different from pacman's core packages (which are often tightly coupled to the kernel), and node's core packages for that matter.
[23:45:03] <stenno> there is an API for the spec?
[23:45:25] <stenno> or do you mean scrapign
[23:45:31] <blueagain> You wouldn't want some random dude maintaining systemd, after all...
[23:45:48] <ljharb> blueagain: pacman isn't an OS, it's a package manager, right?

[23:45:58] <ljharb> blueagain: which makes pacman more like npm. which *is* built entirely of npm modules.
[23:46:02] <ljharb> stenno: scraping
[23:46:07] <stenno> gotcha
[23:46:52] <blueagain> ljharb: for the sake of the argument, they're basically the same, because the node core packages could *potentially* be npm packages, much like pacman's official packages could *potentially* all be in the AUR.

[23:50:11] <blueagain> Besides, you can't really treat npm as something completely unrelated to node. It is meant to be used with node and basically only makes sense with it, no?

[23:51:04] <ljharb> blueagain: it requires node to run, sure. but you don't have to use npm to use node.
[23:51:47] <blueagain> ljharb: in theory. In practice this is moot, I'd say.

[23:58:25] <jaawerth> the biggest gotcha with a moving node-version target is still native addons, which will still absolutely hit you for anything you use with sytystem-node on arch that isn't also a pacman/aur package that gets updated at the same time as system node, at least when a major version change happens (which is admittedly rare)
[23:58:37] <jaawerth> I'm mostly fine with it for system stuff but I use nvm religiously for projects
[23:59:14] <jaawerth> because it's also important that anyone cloning a repo can also easily see which node version it's known to be buildable by without errors
[23:59:33] <jaawerth> (and ideally switch to it iwth a single command anywhere nvm is available)
[23:59:36] <blueagain> jaawerth: I guess I've been lucky there, but I try to stay lightweight on deps as it is, so I have yet to be hit by that.
