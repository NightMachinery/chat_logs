[00:10:59] <sokan> I don't even bash :P
[00:11:05] <MetaNova> I mean, I guess
[00:11:08] <sokan> also Should I add that .pid thingy on znc.conf?
[00:11:19] <MetaNova> um

[00:13:44] <MetaNova> then .. try starting the service again
[00:15:58] <sokan> nope
[00:16:09] <sokan> THIS IS SO ANNOYING
[00:16:11] <MetaNova> shucks
[00:16:34] <sokan> the funny thing is that on previous installation (older hdd) I had created a dedicated user with a dedicated /home on my own and it just worked
[00:16:40] <MetaNova> I'm not really that savvy with service files and the least so with openrc
[00:16:52] <MetaNova> sokan: you can do the same here
[00:17:01] <MetaNova> there's no reason you /have to/ manage ZNC as a service
[00:17:14] <sokan> and I had it working with a service
[00:17:16] <sokan> on boot
[00:17:27] <sokan> and it_just_worked_TM
[00:17:32] <MetaNova> just use a cron job
[00:17:42] <MetaNova> simple. works. problem solved.
[00:17:50] <sokan> I'm rally on the verge of plugging my old hdd in and see what the heck's going
[00:18:00] <sokan> true. and one less service to run
[00:19:02] <sokan> No idea how to cron it though XD

[00:20:00] <MetaNova> so, as whatever user you want to run ZNC under, $ crontab -e
[00:20:20] <MetaNova> input "@reboot /usr/bin/znc >/dev/null 2>&1"
[00:20:44] <MetaNova> else input "*/10 * * * * /usr/bin/znc >/dev/null 2>&1"
[00:21:24] <MetaNova> (assuming this user has a regular $HOME and that the ZNC datadir is default, meaning ZNC will look in $HOME/.znc naturally)
[00:22:06] <sokan>  /var/lib can be considered home I hope
[00:23:02] <sokan> Be back in a bit. Need to figure out how the heck my previous installment of znc worked. Will plug old hdd in

[13:36:34] <Andrio> sokan2, it means the fingerprint your client got from your ZNC isn't the expected one.
[13:37:03] <Andrio> if you don't have any alternative to using a self-signed cert, check whether the fingerprint in your WeeChat config is correct
[13:47:40] <sokan2> Andrio: how do I see the ZNC fingerprint?
[13:48:38] <Andrio> Try something like openssl x509 -in CERT.pem -noout -sha256 -fingerprint
[13:48:53] <Andrio> though not sure what hash algorithm WeeChat is using.
[13:50:31] <MetaNova> /help irc.server.rizon_znc.ssl_fingerprint

[14:13:22] <MetaNova> <MetaNova> /help irc.server.rizon_znc.ssl_fingerprint

[14:14:06] <MetaNova> /set irc.server.rizon_znc.ssl_fingerprint <fingerprint>
[14:14:41] <sokan2> I actually do have SHA512 as well. I only need to s/sha256/sha512 in the openssl command
[14:15:00] <sokan2> to get the corresponding figerprint.
[14:16:58] <MetaNova> are you asking, poorly, if you benefit in any way from using SHA-512 vs SHA-256?
[14:17:43] <sokan2> I was asking if I had access to SHA-512. I figured out I did.
[14:17:45] <MetaNova> specifically within the context of you telling weechat which fingerprint to whitelist?
[14:17:49] <MetaNova> oh
[14:18:12] <sokan2> I just don't know how these things work, so my questions are not even phrased right :(
[14:18:32] <sokan2> I presume there is some security advantage
[14:18:39] <MetaNova> the [[Cert]] page is often my cheat sheet
[14:18:39] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Cert
[14:18:48] <MetaNova> for the openssl fingerprint commands
[14:18:51] <sokan2> SHA512 has higher numbers so I presume it's more secure
[14:19:55] <sokan2> s/higher numbers/longer string of characters
[14:19:55] <ZNC-Linker> sokan2 meant: “SHA512 has longer string of characters so I presume it's more secure”

[15:00:19] <Jarule1> i installed cygwin
[15:00:27] <Jarule1> i use windows 8.1 pro pc
[15:00:40] <Jarule1> i dont know whow to compile the source 
[15:00:48] <MetaNova> you don't
[15:01:00] <Jarule1> i have no knowledge of bash scripting or programming
[15:01:07] <Jarule1> what can i do ?
[15:01:08] <MetaNova> you don't need any
[15:01:16] <Jarule1> ok 
[15:01:23] <MetaNova> run setup-x86_64.exe again and this time, select ZNC to be installed during the package selection stage
[15:01:23] <Jarule1> then how to install znc
[15:01:37] <MetaNova> by selecting it to be installed during the package selection stage
[15:01:48] <Jarule1> i already did
[15:02:06] <Jarule1> how to know where znc is installed ?
[15:02:52] <MetaNova> why does that matter?
[15:03:09] <Jarule1> because then how to setup znc ?
[15:03:12] <MetaNova> you don't need this knowledge to start using it
[15:03:29] <MetaNova> open the cygwin terminal from the start menu
[15:03:33] <Jarule1> did
[15:03:37] <MetaNova> type "znc --makeconf"
[15:03:50] <MetaNova> answer the questions the wizard prompts you
[15:03:51] <Jarule1> with qoutes ?
[15:03:54] <MetaNova> no
[15:04:36] <Jarule1> znc command not found
[15:04:47] <MetaNova> then refer above and select it to be installed
[15:11:41] <Jarule1> i hope it works now
[15:11:47] <Jarule1> i didnt select the version
[15:13:29] <MetaNova> version selection is available from the drop-down menu. the only other way to indicate you want to install a package is to click within the New column, which will select the latest version
[15:13:35] <MetaNova> in short, you didn't select it at all
[15:13:46] <Jarule1> yes now i duid
[15:13:48] <Jarule1> yes now i did
[15:13:58] <MetaNova> then proceed with --makeconf
[15:15:31] <Jarule1> its saying enter passworkd
[15:15:35] <Jarule1> i cant enter
[15:15:51] <Nacorid> Sure you can

[23:30:52] <kurahaupo_> charls_a: Why?
[23:30:53] <DarthGandalf> 2a04:dd01:13:3a:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff is not in the output of ip addr
[23:30:57] <DarthGandalf> therefore it won't work
[23:32:01] <kurahaupo_> charls_a: IPv6 doesn't do broadcast addresses the same way as IPv4. Settings all the bits to 1 is just another valid unicast address
[23:32:54] <charls_a> What can i do then to make it works?
[23:32:56] <kurahaupo_> Your provider probably assigned you 2a04:dd01:13:3a::/64, meaning you can add as many addresses from that range as you like. But you do have to add them, that don't magically appear
[23:33:10] <DarthGandalf> why do you want ffff there?
[23:33:35] <kurahaupo_> charls_a: Use the address given by ip, rather than that :ffff one
[23:34:02] <kurahaupo_> charls_a: or, arrange to add it as a secondary address on the interface.

[23:35:43] <kurahaupo_> You can set it temporarily using « ip addr add dev venet0 2a04:dd01:13:3a:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff/64 » but it won't persist if you reboot.

[23:38:04] <kurahaupo_> charls_a: As long as it's in your assigned range - typically /64 - it should just work.

[23:52:56] <kurahaupo_> charls_a:  Where you have :: add more colons until you have 7 colons overall. Then For each group between colons (or before the first colon, or after the last colon), pad to 4 digits; :22 is the same as :0022. Then just read from the left and check that the digits match.
[23:54:20] <charls_a> lol, in that range no of course, but to be honest im confused with the ipv6
[23:54:28] <Noisytoot> Is there something like *perform that sends the commands before registration?
[23:54:29] <kurahaupo_> Each hexadecimal digits represents 4 bits. The /64 on the end means that the network prefix is the first 64 bits, or 16 digits. As long as the address matches up to the 4th colon, is in the range
[23:56:55] <sokan> to automate commands like like /msg nickserv which module do I load?
