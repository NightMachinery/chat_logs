[00:01:03] <StayHungry> znf: good morning nevertheless :D
[00:04:25] <znf> StayHungry, how is that not clear?
[00:04:59] <znf> looks to me like it's just the fact that you're "playing" the last image again
[00:05:01] <StayHungry> you've seen my command and produced gifs, right?
[00:05:50] <StayHungry> yes, idea is to fade from 1 to 2 to 3 and back to 1, so 1 is not appeared *rough* when loop ends
[00:06:25] <StayHungry> idea is clear i suppose, right? obviously, something is wrong with the command then
[00:06:46] <StayHungry> question is what should be changed
[00:07:36] <StayHungry> how to get from here https://s3.rokket.space/t_qLpz0I.gif to there https://s3.rokket.space/t_6bkwBc.gif
[00:08:15] <StayHungry> now i do it manually by removing a bunch of ending frames via little CLI app called gifsicle
[00:09:25] <StayHungry> basically the quest is about how to fade from 3 to 1 and end immediately, without current delay
[00:14:34] <znf> add the 1st image again, as a 4th, but with -t 1
[00:19:07] <StayHungry> will it eliminate the delay or just make it shorter?

[00:53:34] <Tosin> Does any one know which examples I should reference on the FFMPEG site to perform a basic operation like "ffmpeg -i input.wav output.wav" ? I'm working on performing this in a C program but not sure where to start
[00:54:36] <JEEB> take a look at the transcoding example and limit yourself to audio?

[00:55:01] <JEEB> https://ffmpeg.org/doxygen/trunk/transcoding_8c-example.html
[00:55:15] <JEEB> that is the whole shebang of reading packets from input, feeding those to decoder
[00:55:27] <JEEB> then possibly filtering, and then re-encoding, and pushing them out
[00:55:32] <Tosin> So does the process of just creating a copy of one audio file to another involve transcoding?
[00:55:40] <Tosin> Even if its a wav file?
[00:55:43] <JEEB> that one, yes. although your output "encoder" is raw PCM
[00:56:10] <BtbN> The ffmpeg command also transcodes
[00:56:14] <JEEB> yes
[00:56:16] <JEEB> that is what I meant
[00:56:22] <BtbN> Just that wav is a special case, where the de/encoder does virtually nothing
[00:56:39] <JEEB> you can copy the exact packets through as well, but that requires -c copy with ffmpeg.c
[00:57:01] <JEEB> which just reads packets, and then writes them out
[00:57:02] <BtbN> Given that you probably still want to run silencedetect on it, you do need to "decode" it
[00:57:22] <JEEB> mostly in the sense of AVFrames VS AVPackets
[00:57:28] <JEEB> raw data is the same
[00:57:53] <Tosin> Thanks for keeping up with my program BtbN, but esentially the idea that I'm trying to achieve now is only copy certain frames from one audio file to another given that I know which frames are silent and which are not now

[00:58:24] <Tosin> I only needed to run silencedetect on the input wav file
[00:59:10] <Tosin> Now that I know what frames are considered silent and are not considered silent, I want to pass only those into the output wav file
[01:00:00] <BtbN> You want to hardcode that into your code?

[01:01:05] <Tosin> So what I've done so far is stored the the start and end time intervals into a list
[01:01:48] <Tosin> So the struct looks like [4, 5] -> [62, 75] -> [90,100]
[01:02:05] <Tosin> And what I want to do is essentially up and until the start time of an interval, pass in every frame
[01:02:14] <Tosin> and then resume copying frames from the end time
[01:02:48] <Tosin> So it would copy the frames from 1 second to 4 seconds, then begin again at 5 to 62 seconds, and so on until the duration of the input audio file

[01:31:22] <Tosin> BtbN Do you think it will be possible to all of this in the same program, running the silencedetect om the input file, retrieving the list of of frames that do not need to be included, and then copying them over into another output wav file, or will I likely needed to have two programs to do so?
[01:31:54] <BtbN> The ffmpeg cli tool can literally do it, so that question seems a bit weird
[01:32:07] <BtbN> Just discard the frames silencedetect detected
[01:32:23] <Tosin> I'm trying to not use the CLI tool
[01:32:27] <Tosin> I have a C++ program
[01:32:34] <BtbN> Never said you should use it.
[01:32:40] <Tosin> Oh
[01:32:44] <BtbN> But it definitely is one program...
[01:32:49] <Tosin> Then how would that work?
[01:32:56] <BtbN> Exactly the way I just said
[01:33:20] <Tosin> And by CLI, you mean command line interface right? Is that using cmd?
[01:33:29] <kepstin> Tosin: it's possible, but you don't "retrieve a list of frames". instead as you get each frame, use the metadata from silencedetect to decide whether to copy or drop that frame.
[01:33:33] <DeHackEd> the `ffmpeg` binary is surprisingly powerful
[01:34:03] <Tosin> Okay one second
[01:34:50] <Tosin> https://pastebin.com/KtgKDhCb
[01:35:08] <Tosin> So if you look at this loop, this is where I get each frame back knowing where silence begins and ends
[01:35:21] <BtbN> What are you using buffersink for?
[01:35:37] <Tosin> Output the frames that have silence in them

[10:49:15] <Tosin> This is a snapshot of the line of code and the error that arises from it
[10:49:46] <Tosin> Not entirely sure why this is happening because this is straight from the repo
[10:49:49] <galad> I guess no one tested that code with microsoft compiler
[10:49:49] <JEEB> that's because C++ is much more specific, the example is C.
[10:49:56] <galad> add a few cast, that should fix it
[10:50:11] <JEEB> yes, those two from allocators is just C++ wanting you to specifically cast
[10:50:12] <Tosin> I'll try casting it
[10:50:20] <Tosin> Thanks
[10:50:24] <JEEB> C just is OK with void pointers becoming something else
[10:51:17] <JEEB> galad: it doesn't error out in MSVC's C mode
[10:51:20] <Tosin> type cast': cannot convert from 'void *' to 'FilteringContex
[10:51:39] <galad> JEEB: it's been a long time since the last time I run MSVC ;)
[10:52:15] <Tosin> I applied the cast before the av_malloc_array() function
[10:53:15] <Tosin> These seem to be the only two errors in the code stopping it from running
[10:55:16] <Tosin> I'll see if there's an updated version of it on GitHub rather than the website

[10:55:55] <JEEB> it's a C vs C++ problem, not a problem in the example
[10:56:09] <Tosin> Oh okay
[10:56:20] <Tosin> Hmm so I just need to figure out how to cast it
[10:58:40] <Tosin> It confusing why av_mallocz_array() is a void function
[10:59:42] <JEEB> all memory allocators return a void pointer
[10:59:45] <JEEB> in C
[11:00:08] <JEEB> well, pretty sure C++ still has plenty of those as well :P
[11:00:18] <JEEB> void pointer is just the "generic memory buffer" thing
[11:02:38] <Tosin> Hmm, I'll do some playing around with it
[11:04:32] *** Joins: jkl (~jkl@2600:1700:2420:6d10::3f1)
[11:09:52] <Tosin> Lastly, is AV_LOG different from the Standard Output Logged to the Console?
[11:10:10] <JEEB> av_log you mean?
[11:10:14] <Tosin> yes
[11:10:28] <JEEB> that goes wherever you want, and by default to stderr
[11:10:39] <JEEB> you can register log call-backs if you want it somewhere else
[11:11:31] *** Quits: Vonter (~Vonter@user/vonter) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[11:11:49] <Tosin> Is there a way to not log it at all? Because one of the things I noticed when running av_buffersink_get_frame() with the silence detect filter is that it logs the output to the console
[11:12:45] <Tosin> I believe earlier this week someone told me about a function av_log_set_callback() but how would parameters do I need to pass into avoid it from logging the output?
[11:13:11] <Tosin> Uploaded file: https://uploads.kiwiirc.com/files/2f5e943897eb3bd00699812f6c591710/image.png
[11:13:38] <JEEB> that's just because silencedetect literally is logging each update into normal AV_LOG_INFO
[11:13:40] <Tosin> As you can see from the output here, it logs [silencedetect @ 000001ccfb0a9300] every time
[11:13:56] <Tosin> Okay, is there a way to stop it from doing that?
[11:14:09] <Tosin> Because I would rather just see the stdout that I have
[11:15:42] <Tosin> Does that make sense? JEEB
[11:16:43] <JEEB> tried to check if the verbosity level can be set by AVClass
[11:16:51] <JEEB> that way you could shut it up without shutting up any other logging
[11:17:14] <Tosin> Okay nice
[11:17:16] <JEEB> don't have time to waste on this atm, sorry

[11:17:24] <JEEB> $dayjob
[11:17:40] <Tosin> yeah no problem, I totally understand, thanks for all the help
[11:17:44] <JEEB> w/41
[11:18:03] <Tosin> But just to clarify, the [silencedetect @ 000001ccfb0a9300] string are being sent to standard error though right?
[11:18:37] <Tosin> that part is what i'm unsure about
[11:18:59] <JEEB> it uses av_log so it goes where your logging callbacks go, thankfully it's not hard-coded to stderr :P
[11:19:17] <JEEB> it's just got a hilariously low verbosity level av_log(s, AV_LOG_INFO, "silence_start: %s\n",
[11:19:23] <JEEB> > INFO
[11:19:35] <Tosin> Ah okay
[11:19:36] <JEEB> so in other words, it pops up by default
[11:19:54] <Tosin> and by default its set to stderr like you were saying
[11:20:00] <Tosin> Okay, that is fine
[11:20:09] <Tosin> I just didn't want it going to stdout
[11:20:28] <JEEB> yea av_log by itself does not go to stdout, that would break way too much
[11:20:57] <Tosin> lol nice, thanks for the help
[11:21:22] <Tosin> I think for this week, I'll start working on the wrapper in C# and come back to transcoding another day

[20:55:23] <RoyK> hi all. I'm helping a friend out to do some video capture and streaming (only capture for now) with a raspberry pi 4. It has a decent pi camera (2k or so), but with this command, I only get 1024x768 in 3fps(!). Any idea how to fix this? I beleive the camera can output h.264 as well, at least raspicam seems to do that, but I'd rather use ffmpeg if I can. ffmpeg -framerate 30 -t 60 -i /dev/video0 -f mpegts

[21:05:14] <BtbN> 3fps is probably how fast the PIs CPU can handle the encode
[21:07:47] <kepstin> eh, a raspberry pi 4 actually has a fast enough cpu that software x264 encoding might be on the edge of possible, but you'll definitely have to adjust the speed tune to a faster option.

[21:10:46] <RoyK> that worked - seems I couldn't manage to tell ffmpeg to use the right source or something - the pi processor has mpeg encoding extensions and I don't think those are supported in ffmpeg yet
[21:11:04] <BtbN> You're not telling ffmpeg to transcode in this one, so naturally it's faster
[21:11:23] <BtbN> You will need to set the proper timebase for ffmpeg though, since raw h264 has none
[21:11:33] <RoyK> I tried to tell it not to encode last test as well before testing libx264, but still 3fps

[21:12:10] <RoyK> and no, the cpu wasn't a bottleneck
[21:12:31] <BtbN> You very much told it to encode, by telling it to use libx264
[21:12:49] <RoyK> not the first time - then I just used -c copy
[21:13:07] <BtbN> You did not write such a thing before
[21:13:14] <BtbN> both your prior examples used transcode.
[21:13:30] <RoyK> please - the first attempt was with -c copy, ok?
[21:13:39] <BtbN> Which one do you mean?
[21:13:43] <RoyK> fps was stuck to 3
[21:13:51] <BtbN> The first one had no -c at all, which will default to transcoding, not to copy

[21:15:58] <Atsuko> you could write the reames as raw video
[21:16:01] <RoyK> s/pffempeg/ffmpeg/
[21:16:03] <Atsuko> frames*
[21:16:14] <Atsuko> which would be realtime but super massive file output
[21:16:25] <RoyK> Atsuko: the problem seems to be that ffmpeg just reads from /dev/video0 and doesn't tell it to switch modes
[21:16:32] <kepstin> without any other options, that would be using uncompressed video from the camera, which  could be hitting bandwidth issues in the camera interconnect
[21:17:01] <RoyK> kepstin: please see my comment above
[21:17:45] <kepstin> ffmpeg's v4l input does have options to request specific formats
[21:18:23] <RoyK> I thought so - I just don't know how to use them.
[21:18:42] <RoyK> I really would have noticed if cpu or I/O was the bottleneck
[21:18:46] <RoyK> beleive me
[21:19:13] <kepstin> is this a usb camera or an rpi camera?
[21:19:20] <kepstin> anyways, there's docs for this: http://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-devices.html#video4linux2_002c-v4l2
[21:19:23] <RoyK> rpi camera
[21:19:34] <RoyK> one of the beefy ones
[21:19:58] <kepstin> yeah, i'm not sure about the rpi camera, i think you might need rpi-specific software to make use of its ability to encode video directly from the camera

[21:23:18] <RoyK> I guess I'll just use raspicam to feed ffmpeg
[21:33:55] <RoyK> raspberry pi is well known to use closed source hardware for the video part, which sucks, and have made the arbian distro hate the rpi and promised to never support it
