[01:39:08] <Koen__> yeah it looks like the indices are wrong? I would have written S_(n+1) = S_n + d_n - D_n
[01:39:17] <Kaylah> I would think so too
[01:39:32] <Kaylah> I mean I'm trying to rethink if I interpret the definition of s_n correctly

[01:42:52] <Kaylah> but either way it makes sense that the indices of those 3 terms are always the same

[02:10:17] <Simplar> I just realized how dumb I was all that time
[02:10:20] <Koen__> vector + vector = vector
[02:10:22] <Simplar> My goodness XD
[02:10:22] <buster> it's a very subtle thing
[02:10:27] <Koen__> and there is no such thing as point + point
[02:10:29] <Oni^> : D
[02:10:56] <Simplar> So we basically find the coordinates of the vector and then we have a directed segment of a needed length
[02:10:59] <Simplar> LOL
[02:11:14] <Simplar> and then we can simply transform & add it however we need
[02:11:22] <Simplar> Oh goodness, is it that simple?
[02:11:31] <Koen__> although there is such a thing as a barycentre of points, so if s and t are such that s+t = 1, then you could define s A + t B for points A and B
[02:11:32] <buster> isn't it lovely
[02:11:54] <Oni^> ,math
[02:12:23] <Koen__> for instance it makes sense to say that the middle of segment [AB] is 1/2 A + 1/2 B
[02:12:29] <buster> we have given ourselves the luxury of a distinguished origin and the unit basis vectors ... so we're perfectly able to pretend that points are vectors too, if it suits us (and that's what i was doing)

[12:54:23] <bildramer> I think it depends on what "ways" means. is getting 1 1 1 4 and 1 4 1 1 different "ways"?
[12:55:10] <bildramer> if not, then the question is equivalent to "in how many ways can Lisa toss 82 dice?". if yes, then it's a bit more complex. either way the number is going to be huge, so it's definitely not 36949857 - I also don't expect it to be odd

[12:55:20] <Simplar> a vector in*
[12:56:09] <bildramer> rotate by each angle in the right direction and order. maybe multiply the rotation matrices together first then apply the matrix all at once (again pay attention to order)

[12:58:05] *** Joins: LucaTM (~LucaTM@user/lucatm)
[12:58:21] <bildramer> well, say your first angle is the z rotation axis, or a xy rotation: then you have a matrix that has the top left 2x2 filled, then the rest is zeroes except 1 at the bottom right. what that matrix does is mix the x and y coordinates of the vector and leave z alone
[12:59:00] <bildramer> that's equivalent to saying new x = x * cos(phi) + y * sin(phi), new y = y * cos(phi) - x * sin(phi), new z = z
[12:59:03] <W> Simplar, yes. Treat the vector as a 3x1 matrix.
[12:59:14] <kobalt> bildramer: 1 1 1 4 and 1 4 1 1 are same ways.
[13:00:01] <bildramer> or something akin to that. anyway, almost always yes, you get the matrix first (from the angles), then multiply the vector by it
[13:00:12] <qergle> 36949857 is right

[17:00:33] <xaltsc> Hey, I'm trying to describe Spec Z[T]. So far, I've established that prime ideals were either (f), f irreducible over Q or (p, f), f irreducible mod p. Concerning the closure of these points, I think it's clear that the (p, f) are maximal, whereas, for the ideals (f), I think the closure is made up of (q, g) where g is irreducible mod q and divides f mod q, am I right ?
[17:01:15] <xaltsc> f in Z[T] ofc.

(total permutations) - 3C1 * 2 * 8! (single fixed couples) + 3C2  * 2^2 * 7! (pairs of couples) - 3C3 * 2^3 * 6! (in all 3 the husband and wife are adjacent). Is this correct?

[21:04:45] <qergle> aren't there 19! total permutations (first off)?
[21:05:05] <Guest17> There's 10 people in total, so 9!
[21:05:09] <qergle> oh, misread, 10 people not 10 couples.
[21:05:30] <qergle> so 3 couples and the other 4 are non-couple randos?
[21:05:38] <Guest17> Yes.

[21:08:54] <qergle> kobalt: i still don't see how this proves anything, you can assume that which you're proviing.
[21:09:14] <Guest17> So first I subtracted the case where there's one couple that I transformed into a single person, but I multiply by 2, i.e. 2! because there's 2 ways to order the husband/wife. And since there are 3 such couples, I multiplied by 3 (i.e. 3C1).
[21:11:57] <Guest17> Then I did the same for two couples which didn't sit the right way, and then three.
[21:12:44] <Guest17> Taking into account (hopefully) the number of times I added/subtracted them in the previous terms, which it turns out I don't have to worry about that (I think that conforms to that inclusion-exclusion formula)
[21:15:38] *** Joins: jess (~jess@libera/staff/jess)
[21:15:50] <Guest17> For the case with two couples, I shrunk them into one person each, that times 3C2 ways to choose these 2 couples, and times 2^2, which is because of the order of h/w inside these 2 chosen couples.
[21:17:08] <cherim> The first chapter of Stanley's "Enumerative combinatorics" contains basics and a general introduction into the subject.
[21:17:11] <Z-module> qedders: pretty good firefighting-exam joke; there are many variations on that theme.
[21:17:12] <cherim> It is followed by 203 exercises, of which exactly one (#2) asks to compute some particular numbers (like "number of permutations of MISSISSIPPI with four S not consecutive").
[21:17:15] <cherim> That I think is healthy, unlike 4 days of non-stop ad-hoc inclusion-exclusion with answers by inspection...
[21:17:47] <Guest17> This is just a puzzle someone gave me.
[21:18:17] <cherim> Yes, but if you look at the logs and what kobalt brought here, you'll see the origin of "4 days"
[21:18:31] <Z-module> "Enumerative, except we mostly won't explicitly enumerate"
[21:18:33] <cherim> He's finally to having "n" in his questions though
[21:18:49] <cherim> Also, your answer for the puzzle is correct
[21:19:08] <cherim> (If all seats are distinguishable)
[21:19:50] <Guest17> They're sitting at a round table, does that still mean distinguishable seats?
[21:20:13] <Guest17> I mean, they are different seats, but the rotations of the permutations don't matter.

[21:27:35] <cherim> Are there 9 or 10 people total?

[21:28:24] <qergle> 10 people, 6 of which are couples (3 couples)
[21:28:51] <cherim> And it starts with 9!=10!/10 since rotations irrelevant?
[21:29:24] <qergle> it's a round table with no start or end, so i presume up to rotation.
[21:30:10] <cherim> Round table sometimes is used just to state that start and end are adjacent, but OK
[21:30:40] <qergle> yes, aside from this being cyclic (start and end joined), i believe the intent is rotations are irrelevant.

[22:38:09] <mh_le> as in the probability distributions?
[22:38:40] <river> yeah
[22:38:49] <river> which implies Beta(1/2,1/2)=Gamma(1/2)^2 = pi ? i think
[22:38:53] <river> pi/4 maybe
[22:38:54] <mh_le> ah interestig

[22:39:29] <river> ah its pi/8
[22:39:49] <river> i suppose I can merge them with no trouble, sqrt(t(1-t))
[22:39:59] <mh_le> can't you just devide by Gamma(x+y) on both sides of that equality?
[22:40:06] <mh_le> divide*
[22:40:14] <river> yeah
[22:40:18] <river> Beta(x,y)=Gamma(x)Gamma(y)/Gamma(x+y)
[22:40:57] <mh_le> setting x = y = 1/2 should enable you to evaluate the LHS
