[05:00:36] <wroathe> So a friend of mine just called me asking for advice on a feature that his employer is asking him to build. He's working for a terrible big bank, and they want the classic feature where they've got an overlay full of transactions in the browser, and a print button in the upper right corner. When they click on the print button they want the transactions to show up in a printable view. A few months ago,
[05:00:42] <wroathe> when he asked me about this, he said that he thought there would be at most 20 or 30 transactions, and so I recommended a pure CSS solution with media queries. Where this gets interesting is that he's a relatively junior developer, and he's the only person on shore here in the U.S., and there's a huge team of developers offshore in India also working on the project, and so they've established patterns
[05:00:48] <wroathe> and practices for how things should be done. Anyway, so he neglected to mention that they already had a pattern for this, and that they're using a library on the front end to generate PDFs, jsPDF. To me, that seems like nonsense, and that obviously the API layer should be handling dynamic PDF generation (the primary benefit being that it can be called from multiple places in multiple distinct
[05:00:55] <wroathe> applications that need to generate that PDF).
[05:01:23] <wroathe> And I was pushing that as a recommendation and saying that he should fight back and get them to start generating PDFs on the server side, but then he asked me an interesting question? "Why are PDF generation libraries on the client side so popular?"
[05:01:47] <wroathe> And the only thought that I could come up with is that an organization might want to save on the CPU cycles for generating those documents by forcing browsers to do it.
[05:02:00] <wroathe> Is there something I'm missing here? Is client-side binary file generation the way of the future?

[05:32:54] <sheetjs> its initial popularity stemmed from the novelty, and over time it became more useful.  Like with many projects, as browsers improved people realized that it was possible to do the work in the browser

[05:38:33] <wroathe> sheetjs: The only advantage I see to client side generation is saving on CPU cycles and bandwidth, but the drawback is that you need to implement client side PDF generation in all of the distinct applications your organization uses
[05:38:54] <wroathe> sheetjs: Whereas the server-side approach is reusable in any context (and some would say tried and true)
[05:38:59] <sheetjs> there are two questions
[05:39:49] <sheetjs> 1) "why is client-side PDF generation so popular?" yes there are technical reasons like server resources, yes there are "full-stack" reasons, but over time the JS libraries are more battle-tested
[05:40:09] <sheetjs> It's a lot easier to drop in jsPDF into your frontend than have to fight with the backend
[05:40:22] <wroathe> That may be recently true, but some other languages like Java and C# have been generating PDFs for far longer than Javascript has
[05:40:46] <wroathe> sheetjs: Well, sure, if resources to work on your backend are an issue that could be a consideration
[05:40:51] <sheetjs> 2) "should you generate PDFs in the browser?" that is harder to answer.  For bank statements and the like, you may need to retain an identical copy in the server.  For that, you def need to do it in the server
[05:40:59] <wroathe> sheetjs: But this is a big bank, and so you have to assume that if they already have APIs, they have API maintainers
[05:41:02] <sheetjs> do you know how old jsPDF is?

[05:42:56] <wroathe> sheetjs: Indeed, but the maturity argument doesn't hold up as a reason to prefer client side over server side.
[05:43:01] <wroathe> sheetjs: JS is still playing catch up
[05:43:17] <sheetjs> JS has a unique advantage of ubiquity
[05:43:33] <wroathe> sheetjs: So does Java
[05:43:48] <GreenJello> I wouldn't use a Java library on the backend
[05:43:51] <sheetjs> so while the library may not be as mature, its utility in the server and in the browser gives it a userbase that Java does not have
[05:43:53] <GreenJello> but I do have frontend code

[05:44:43] <wroathe> GreenJello: The only real considerations that come in are the technical pros and cons one way or another
[05:45:09] <wroathe> (client vs server generation, that is)
[05:45:33] <sheetjs> client-side generation is easy to roll out without having to disrupt the backend
[05:45:49] <sheetjs> it's entirely possible to deploy it in a sequestered manner

[05:48:59] <wroathe> sheetjs: I suspect that what's actually happening in this scenario is that every time they've gotten a request to generate a PDF, they've handed it off to the offshore team, and the offshore team has been reluctant to get API developers involved, and have tried to do as much as they can in the browser before falling back to that
[05:49:04] <wroathe> But that's all speculation
[05:50:03] <sheetjs> that's likely

[05:54:34] <wroathe> The reasons I can think of, again, are saving on paying for the CPUs to generate those PDFs on the server side (at the expense of needing to implement PDF generation in the front end of any app that needs it), and the possibility that they just don't have the developers to do it on the server side
[05:54:50] <wroathe> Or malfeasance, which I think at this point is the most likely

[05:56:38] <wroathe> I appreciate you trying to help, but I think you're missing my point a little
[05:57:21] <sheetjs> so lets take a step back
[05:57:23] <wroathe> I think client side is an architecturally inferior approach, that will lead to the need to add PDF generation logic to any application in your stable that needs it
[05:57:30] <wroathe> Rather than just sticking it in a central API server

[06:04:42] <sheetjs> overall, there's something to be said about putting all of the design work in the hands of the front-end devs
[06:06:09] *** Joins: Nimzowitsch (~nimzo@user/nimzowitsch)
[06:06:47] <wroathe> So talking this through has made me realize that the audience is different. If you're just a guy on a shoe string budget for hosting your application, and limited familiarity with server side development generation, than client side PDF generation might be right for you, but once your budget for hosting increases slightly and you start eyeing having multiple applications (and maybe a team of 5+
[06:06:53] <wroathe> developers), than that becomes significantly less desirable
[06:07:15] <wroathe> development generally*
[06:07:27] <wroathe> So I understand it's popularity now. It's a foot in the door.
[06:07:45] <sheetjs> microsoft does client-side stuff in office 365
[06:07:50] <wroathe> But I don't see any benefit to it, whatsoever, for a large organization
[06:08:04] <wroathe> Client-side "stuff"?
[06:08:26] <sheetjs> yeah some of the office 365 apps use sheetjs open source in the browser to generate excel exports

[06:11:33] *** Quits: Nimzowitsch (~nimzo@user/nimzowitsch) (Remote host closed the connection)
[06:11:54] <wroathe> We started out with desktop apps that obviously generated their own binary files, and then moved everything into the browser. We then got used to sticking everything in the API layer, because the idea was to have thin clients and a fat server capable of performing any operation a user might want to perform among all of your applications. Now it seems we've come full circle, and we're treating the
[06:12:00] <wroathe> browser like it's an SDK for building those original desktop apps
[06:12:01] <wroathe> And yet we expect cloud persistence for our data

[06:14:52] <wroathe> So it sounds like client side binary file generation really is the path forward.
[06:14:58] <wroathe> To my surprise.

[10:50:26] <Maxdamantus> I don't see what's so wrong with that code. It's just another example of what happens when you allow shadowing .. which is presumably intentionally allowed.
[10:50:34] <ljharb> they designed the temporal dead zone very carefully to disallow that kind of confusing code, while allowing stuff like `function f() { return x; } const x = 3; f()`
[10:50:41] <ljharb> the shadowing happens at `let x`
[10:50:46] <ljharb> because code is read left to right
[10:50:54] <ljharb> nothing to the right of `let x` should be able to see an outer x.
[10:51:39] <Maxdamantus> I don't think "left" and "right" are the way to see that, but maybe I should have used a different example.
[10:52:00] <ljharb> it surely is. it's also the way the spec requires code to be parsed
[10:52:03] <Maxdamantus> n> let x = 4; { let tmp = x + 1; let x = tmp; }
[10:52:04] <jellobot> (fail) ReferenceError: Cannot access 'x' before initialization
[10:52:26] <ljharb> sure. that's confusing tho. because you can't say "let has block scope" if it doesn't take effect during the whole block
[10:52:46] <Maxdamantus> I think it should be seen temporally, and `x + 1` in my first example happens before `x` is bound.
[10:52:46] <ljharb> that would make let and const only have "rest of the block" scope. which is weird and surprising to many people.

[10:53:51] <Maxdamantus> Well, if the language designers wanted temporal things to go left-to-right there, they should have used a different syntax for variable declaration and assignment.

[10:54:37] <ljharb> variable assignment happens lexically.

[10:55:12] <ljharb> that's a big part of why relying on hoisting is bad - because it means you're relying on a two-pass approach instead of a simple one-pass left-right top-down approach.

[10:56:50] <Maxdamantus> I think if you want to take the left-to-right thing to the extreme, you will have the variable last in assignment/declaration, since the modification of the variable happens after the evaluation of the value it's being assigned.
[10:57:00] <Maxdamantus> and certainly there are languages that reflect that.
[10:57:32] <Maxdamantus> it's just against existing conventions.
[10:58:29] <ljharb> which languages reflect that?
[10:58:53] <ljharb> (but also "against existing conventions" is a strong reason to not do a thing, with no other context)
[10:59:19] <Maxdamantus> Looking at Wikipedia, COBOL, TI-BASIC, Casio BASIC, some others that I haven't heard of.
[10:59:28] <Maxdamantus> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_(computer_science)#Notation
[10:59:58] <Maxdamantus> It's just in older languages where the "variable first" convention hadn't been so strongly established as it is today.
[11:00:38] *** Quits: Ducki (~ducki@user/ducki) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[11:00:47] <ljharb> ok
[11:00:52] <ljharb> so why would we want to go back to that
[11:01:05] <ljharb> bucking conventions like that would make the language worse
[11:01:13] <ljharb> unless it was such a massive improvement that it was worth it. and it's really not.
[11:02:03] <Maxdamantus> I'm not saying we would. My point regarding the left-to-right thing is simply that if `let tmp = x + 1; let x = tmp;` is allowed, then `let x = x + 1;` should also be allowed (as meaning the same thing, just without that extra `tmp` variable).
[11:02:29] <Maxdamantus> because variable assignment/declaration doesn't follow the left-to-right paradigm like most things.
[11:02:40] <ljharb> i don't follow your logic
[11:02:54] <ljharb> i understand that the first pattern could be allowed, and it'd be arguably not confusing
[11:02:56] *** Joins: stenno (~stenno@user/stenno)
[11:03:11] <ljharb> but variable assignment definitely does, always including with the first pattern, follow the left-to-right paradigm
[11:03:36] <Maxdamantus> in the assignment expression `x = y + 1`, the assignment of `x` (something denoted on the left) happens after the evaluation of `y + 1` (something denoted on the right)
[11:04:45] <ljharb> i mean yes, that is what actually happens
[11:04:53] <ljharb> but that's not how i think anybody thinks about it
[11:04:55] <Maxdamantus> It only follows the left-to-right paradigm in expression evaluation of the operands.
[11:05:18] <Maxdamantus> the actual operation which modifies the thing on the left happens after the evaluation of the thing on the left.
[11:05:51] <Maxdamantus> n> const o = { set x(v){ console.log("left"); } }; o.x = console.log("right");
[11:05:52] <jellobot> (okay) right left
[11:05:54] <ljharb> yes, that is true
[11:05:59] <ljharb> but that's not the mental model
[11:06:20] <ljharb> and `let x = x + 1` MUST always be equivalent to `let x; x = x + 1`
[11:06:46] <Maxdamantus> Okay, so your "left-to-right" model shouldn't apply to variable assignments and declarations.
[11:06:52] <ljharb> for const, you get a syntax error in the second case, but with your semantics, for let you'd silently get a different value
[11:07:05] <ljharb> i mean regardless of how you describe it, `let x = x + 1` can't ever refer to an outer x
[11:07:11] <ljharb> that's absurd for many reasons.
[11:09:33] <Maxdamantus> n> let x; x = x + 1; console.log({ x });
[11:09:33] <jellobot> (okay) { x: NaN }
[11:10:06] <Maxdamantus> To me that just means `let x = undefined; x = x + 1;`
[11:10:19] <Maxdamantus> I don't see why `let x = x + 1;` has to mean the same thing.
[11:10:48] <ljharb> it has to result in x being the same thing
[11:11:07] <ljharb> because of tennent's correspondence principle, i think
[11:12:53] <Maxdamantus> fwiw, another thing that typically breaks the left-to-right paradigm is function application. in some ways it might be more natural for the function to come after the applicands, since the function is invoked after the evaluation of the applicands.
[11:13:16] <Maxdamantus> that's why the reverse application operator (|>) sometimes seems natural.

[13:17:31] <Cork> doesn't mean it isn't in an infinite loop though
[13:18:43] <no_gravity> I witness this behaviour often these days. I never in depth analyzed what causes it. My guess would be some timer running code that does expensive dom queries to see if a certain field is in a certain state or whatever.
[13:19:06] <no_gravity> Maybe diffing the whole dom against some data structure :)
[13:19:22] <no_gravity> I don't know how crazy library devs are these days. But definitely very crazy.

[13:22:52] <no_gravity> Some other optimizations that come to mind: 1) Set the lazy loading flag on the iframe. 2) Set the iframe to "display: none" or even remove it from the dom when it is not visible.
[13:23:23] <no_gravity> It might even be possible to render it to a canvas and then display the canvas instead of the iframe.

[14:43:33] <Maxdamantus> ashnur: I came across it after looking at a couple of other search results.
[14:44:15] <Maxdamantus> but yes, it seems that TCP isn't actually about an equivalence between expressions and IIFEs as other things seem to suggest.
[14:44:24] <ashnur> yeah
[14:45:53] <Maxdamantus> (and as I kind of expressed earlier, I don't think the latter is a very useful thing to try to achieve, and existing languages aren't designed according to it)

[14:59:32] <Maxdamantus> so actually, after reading that article, it seems that the JS behaviour is actually a counterexample to TCP, since TCP is about how you can rearrange something like `let x = y + 1; return x + 1;` to `return (x => { return x + 1; })(y + 1);`
[14:59:43] *** Quits: jmcantrell (~weechat@user/jmcantrell) (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[14:59:54] <Maxdamantus> but hoisting breaks that.
[15:01:05] <Maxdamantus> `let x = () => x; return x;` to `return (x => { return x; })(() => x);`
[15:01:20] <Maxdamantus> those are different in JS because of hoisting.
[15:01:39] <Maxdamantus> if it weren't for hoisting, they would be the same.

[15:11:25] <Maxdamantus> thinking back, I have actually thought about what my preferred behaviour for this sort of thing is, and I think my preference is simply to distinguish between `function` declarations (which should be hoisted) and `let`/`const` declarations (which should not be hoisted).
[15:12:28] <Maxdamantus> So you'd be able to write `function foo(){ return bar(); } function bar(){ return foo(); }` but not `let foo = () => bar(); let bar = () => foo();`
[15:15:43] <Maxdamantus> I'm also aware of a system of "placeholders" where checking safe declarations and uses of functions is a special case of those rules.
[15:16:23] <Maxdamantus> Meh, too late to be thinking about this atm.

[18:42:47] <MJCD> and is gapps so that still means a subscription waaah
[18:43:04] <wovixo> Right, but they have a free platform that should cover what you need.
[18:43:31] <MJCD> gapps is 100% paid
[18:43:50] <MJCD> even to get api access as described in the link above
[18:43:57] <wovixo> Oh, you have to use GApps with that Coupler? Bummer.
[18:44:15] <MJCD> it's not "a coupler"
[18:44:19] <MJCD> it's just called coupler lol
[18:44:23] <MJCD> the site
[18:46:33] <wovixo> I'm going to call it "That Coupler" just to annoy you. Lol.
[18:46:55] <MJCD> and i'm going to call you Susan because I know it makes you happy <3
[18:48:30] <MJCD> there's some extensions for sheets to do a lottt of stuff

[19:08:15] <bambanxx> all apis works trough ajax?
[19:08:47] <MJCD> ... with an api key ;p
[19:08:54] <MJCD> which requires google workspaces ;p
[19:09:03] <MJCD> [what they call their paid stuff this week]
[19:09:54] <bambanxx> i mean, work with an api, must  use ajax ?
[19:10:08] <bambanxx> can you use without ajax?
[19:10:26] <MJCD> there's no way to enforce that it's ajax or not lol
[19:10:33] <MJCD> http requests are http requests
[19:11:31] <systemfault> bambanxx: Stop complicating it... to do "Ajax" is to do a HTTP request using the browser's built-in HTTP client
[19:11:39] <MJCD> lol right
[19:11:53] <MJCD> also uhhh
[19:12:01] <systemfault> Do you need to do HTTP requests to get any type of data on the web? YES.
[19:12:02] <MJCD> pretty sure these free gapps for this kind of work
[19:12:13] <MJCD> is just straight sending all my data to china

[19:12:35] <bambanxx> i ask because i am confused, i am learning
[19:12:46] <bambanxx> i was wondering if fetch is same as ajax
[19:12:51] <MJCD> yes. ;p
[19:13:03] <MJCD> it's literally just a more friendly wrapper for XHR

[19:13:22] <MJCD> before fetch, people usually just wrote their own 'fetch'alike
[19:13:42] <MJCD> because it's trivial, except to the webstandards teams apparently lol

[20:53:47] <entuland> you'll end up querying the default as a first pick and putting it into a variable of some sort anyways if you want to give the user a choice
[20:54:24] <entuland> and then use that variable in all the spots, without letting any function use the defaults _unless you explicitly want it to_
[20:55:24] <entuland> if you know you're going down that road, start using such a variable immediately, or you may end up with the user choice only affecting half of your system or so
[20:56:56] <entuland> even if I weren't planning on giving a choice in the near future I would set the system up that way to avoid the need to go back and alter any existing code shall I need to change my mind (or shall the requirement change)
[20:58:29] <wroathe> Sometimes there's something unnerving about the way people write typed Javascript. I can't put my finger on it.

[21:30:48] <wroathe> How do you guys feel about the practice of co-locating tests along with the code their testing in the source tree? On one hand, they make imports and finding the code that's being tested easier, but on the other hand they clutter up the primary source directory.

[21:33:24] <MJCD> but still
[21:33:41] <joepie91> I'm not a fan of such sidecar-file approaches, though for a different reason - you very quickly get stuck in "wait what file does this test belong to" quicksand once you dive into testing cross-cutting concerns
[21:33:52] <wroathe> GreenJello: Yeah, that's where I think I stand too.

[21:34:12] <MJCD> the code the test is related to is largely irrelevant
[21:34:18] <MJCD> you test against the /spec/

[21:34:33] <MJCD> ... lol what
[21:34:35] <MJCD> I did nothing
[21:34:50] <ljharb> wroathe: colocating tests imo is a terrible pattern
[21:34:59] <ljharb> tests should be in a top-level directory with a parallel structure to the code
[21:35:01] <MJCD> that's literally what I said twice lol
[21:35:06] <joepie91> wroathe: like, with the sidecar-file approach you are essentially building a rigid taxonomy for your tests that *must* exactly match the taxonomy for your code, and so it will suffer from the usual problem of rigid taxonomies that you *will* run into a case that doesn't fit into it and it will block your focus and productivity trying to figure out which classification is the least incorrect
[21:35:07] <MJCD> got me ignored apparently
[21:35:10] <MJCD> "oh no!"
[21:35:17] <ljharb> "jump to file" means that it's equally easy to find the code being tested regardless of structure.
[21:35:34] <GreenJello> wroathe, I find it's the opposite; mirroring the source structure is only easily manageable on small projects
[21:35:40] <MJCD> lol

[21:36:41] <wroathe> joepie91: Well, that rigid taxonomy you're talking about is usually considered the best practice, regardless of which approach you take. Before it came full circle, people were usually still trying to mirror the source directory structure
[21:36:53] <wroathe> joepie91: For the same reason, I suppose, as we're no co-locating our tests
[21:37:00] <MJCD> lol
[21:37:08] <wroathe> joepie91: I.e. making it easy to find the associating between what's being tested and the test easier.
[21:37:25] <wroathe> GreenJello: I suppose that's true.
[21:37:29] <MJCD> > ignore everyone who doesn't instantly agree with what you were subjectively asking for opinions on, that do not match your own
[21:37:30] <MJCD> gg
[21:37:38] <wroathe> joepie91: Granted, unit tests tend to follow the structure more than other kinds of tests.
[21:37:48] <MJCD> yeah joepie91
[21:38:38] *** Joins: silly (~silly@user/silly)
[21:39:29] <joepie91> wroathe: honestly, rigid taxonomies are precisely the sort of thing that's often *assumed* (or even taught) to be a good practice, but that isn't really
[21:39:48] <joepie91> they feel desirable because you can make things 'elegant' and neatly categorized into boxes
[21:39:58] <wroathe> Well, for unit tests they make sense. The tests are usually narrowly scoped to the unit under test.
[21:40:13] <wroathe> For E2E, integration, or functional tests that's not the case usually
[21:40:39] <MJCD> Think I got "restricted" on linkedin for calling some girl an Oprah clone because all celebrities are cloned to ensure continuity
[21:40:45] <MJCD> that's so great
[21:41:26] <joepie91> but in reality the real world is messier than any taxonomy you might dream up upfront, and your design will have to accommodate for that, and doing so effectively is much more important than some nebulous sense of 'elegance'
[21:41:42] <wroathe> You've lost me
[21:41:47] <wroathe> Can you get more concrete?

[21:42:54] * joepie91 is lagging FYI
[21:43:49] <joepie91> wroathe: I'm not saying that no tests should *ever* mirror the source structure, to be clear - just that your project structure should not be designed under the assumption that they will
[21:44:02] <joepie91> in cases where it makes sense to mirror, go right ahead
[21:44:11] <joepie91> but there certainly will be cases where it doesn't
[21:44:20] *** Joins: Rockwood_ (~Rocky@user/rocky)
[21:44:33] <joepie91> and that's something that you need to account for in your design from the start, rather than assuming "it mirrors the source" as the baseline and making everything else an "exception"
[21:44:37] <MJCD> I disagree entirely though only your opinion matters apparently
[21:44:38] <MJCD> lol
[21:44:39] <wroathe> I don't understand. You don't design projects around the structure of your tests. You structure the tests around the design of your project. It's just the case that unit tests are often organized according to the units their testing.

[21:54:40] <MJCD> there is no "dmv equiv" with a fee

[22:12:44] <MJCD> Because "work" isn't the rigid structure you've built it up to be in your mind -- probably as a coping mechanism

[22:13:17] <Svitkona> a coping mechanism
