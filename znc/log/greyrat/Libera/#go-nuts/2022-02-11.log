[02:20:10] <b0nn> borrougagnou: pasteEpirator.ErrorChannel is a channel that you are reading
[02:20:35] <b0nn> you will need to find what is writing to that channel to discover where the error is being generated

[04:02:08] <moldorcoder7_> what is the best way to convert a []interface{} to []string ?
[04:02:14] <moldorcoder7_> is it possible in 1 line ?
[04:03:38] <A_Dragon> why do you have a []interface{}?
[04:03:39] *** Joins: fikran (~fikran@user/fikran)
[04:03:48] <b0nn> you can only 'convert' it via type assertion, and you'd have to loop over every interface{}
[04:04:09] <b0nn> each interface{} can be anything, including a []string{} itself
[04:05:32] <moldorcoder7_> b0nn, ok thanks
[04:05:44] <moldorcoder7_> A_Dragon, lib output
[04:05:53] <A_Dragon> is it a lib you can change?
[04:07:12] <b0nn> bob:=[]string{}; for _, iface := range []interface{} {if t, ok := iface.(string); ok { bob = append(bob, t)}}}
[04:07:29] <b0nn> That will skip over any that aren't strings
[04:07:50] <moldorcoder7_> ok nice
[04:07:58] <moldorcoder7_> A_Dragon, no it is gojq

[04:12:11] <borrougagnou> *back again,
[04:12:17] <b0nn> Stringer interface
[04:12:45] <b0nn> So, a Type can implement the Stringer interface, and have a String method attached, but it's not /required/
[04:13:07] <b0nn> What are you trying to do?
[04:13:20] <b0nn> Sometimes fmt can help out
[04:15:55] <borrougagnou> also I try to found something similar to "dir" in python https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#dir
[04:16:13] <borrougagnou> something to list function/variable related to an object
[04:16:54] <borrougagnou> so, I thought try convert everything in "tostring" to make everything more "visible"
[04:17:21] <b0nn> The /easiest/ id fmt.Printf("%#v\n", t)
[04:17:53] <b0nn> that's a print to stdout of the type with field names and values (if a map/struct
[04:18:09] <b0nn> I'm assuming this is a debugging isuue
[04:18:34] <borrougagnou> "%#v" ???
[04:18:48] <borrougagnou> @b0
[04:19:16] <borrougagnou> b0nn, seem like something I try to looking for :), I'll test that
[04:19:23] <b0nn> https://pkg.go.dev/fmt
[04:19:36] <borrougagnou> because I have an object, who depend about another object, who depend about another object...

[07:00:47] <Church> Possibly stupid question, there a known way to vendor packages repositores such as "golang.org/" for offline(lan) only use? Ideally looking to be able to serve them up from a web server at home to my own dev devices when needed

[07:23:02] <b0nn> Church: I don't understand why you need to vendor golang.org - as they're part of the distribution
[07:23:49] <b0nn> I suspect that there's  more to your question, though, so it might help people wanting to help if you expand a bit and explain what you are trying to do, and what problems you are facing
[07:25:10] <Church> Sigh... okay so that's a misunderstanding on my part then, I thought golan.org namespaced packages weren't bundle with a golang release. Reason for asking is I'll be out camping for a few weeks but still want to do some development when time permits despite the lack of net connection.
[07:26:18] <b0nn> I mean, you can git clone and use that if you need
[07:26:28] <b0nn> but you will have to sort your local DNS out
[07:27:35] <b0nn> oh, hmm, I think that you mean everything you can find on golang.org
[07:27:47] <b0nn> I was thinking that you just mean standard library
[07:28:05] <b0nn> meant*
[07:30:35] <b0nn> Church: I think that you will need to know in advance what 3rd party things you will be using

[15:11:29] <bookworm> the point here is external though

[19:10:26] <fizzie> Not really a thing. Two conventional alternatives are either adding a `Valid bool` field, or using a pointer (either pointing to a struct or nil).
[19:11:12] <pyzozord> hmm but then that affects how I must model my javascript schema
[19:11:23] <pyzozord> I don't my language to affect my external data type
[19:11:42] <pyzozord> *json
[19:11:58] <pyzozord> what do people do in go when they need to handle json that can either be an object or a false?
[19:12:13] <bookworm> just translate between the js type and go when it comes in and when it goes somewhere else again
[19:12:14] <fizzie> A custom marshaller/unmarshaller, perhaps.

[19:14:46] <fizzie> I kind of suspect encoding/json's default handling can not successfully unmarshal "object or false" into anything else than an interface{}.
[19:15:21] <fizzie> (Although are you sure you don't want "object or null" in the JSON too? Kind of sounds more natural for something that's either an object or the absence of an object.)
[19:15:39] <pyzozord> very sure I want "false"
[19:16:19] <bookworm> why?
[19:16:39] <bookworm> im js land null is just as falsey as false
[19:16:43] <bookworm> in*
[19:16:53] <pyzozord> those jsons are user interface, they are user facing configuration files expected to be editied manually
[19:17:05] <seebs> if something is being done in a language that has sum types, it makes sense for it to want a javascript file that has either struct-or-false, but Go doesn't do sum types
[19:17:17] <pyzozord> "corsOptions: false" makes sense "corsOptions: null" does not
[19:17:35] <pyzozord> I really want "falsy" value there
[19:17:47] <pyzozord> but if I can't get falsey value, I want false

[19:19:36] <fizzie> Personally as an alleged human I think "corsOptions: false" doesn't make any more sense than "corsOptions: null". For the former, my first thought is "it's 'options' plural, how can it be just 'false'?" And neither makes as much sense as just omitting the whole thing if there's nothing to say about it.
[19:20:26] <fizzie> But in any case, a type with a custom MarshalJSON/UnmarshalJSON method might be the closest.

[19:28:19] <pyzozord> how does it do it, via the reflection api?
[19:28:35] <bookworm> yes
[19:29:13] <pyzozord> I found that default json package has tag `json:"foo,omitempty"`, I think maybe I'll use that
[19:29:59] <fizzie> It can also convert numbers to strings, and skip fields entirely, that's I think the extent of what you can do to encoding/json via tags.
