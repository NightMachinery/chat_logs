[15:12:55] <richrd> anyone here got infected by corona?
[15:13:53] <srp> i might've dodged delta thanks to the vaccine
[15:14:08] <srp> i had a fairly rough respiratory illness for a week or so
[16:24:08] <bl1nk> fortunately not but someone close to me got infected early 2020
[16:25:22] <richrd> I had to go to  a test today, i don't have symptoms but I was close to an infected person :/ still waiting for the test resuts
[16:35:29] <Activ8> doesn't mean you will catch it just because you where close, depends on your response system
[16:35:40] <Activ8> having my second jab friday 2:05pm
[16:36:37] <richrd> yeah that's true, hoping for the best
[16:36:59] <richrd> the test results should come in pretty fast, within a day which is nice
[16:37:20] <richrd> I've got my 30th birthday on saturday and I wouldn't like to stay home in quarantine :D
[16:38:07] <Activ8> I got tests kits here and had a test last week was negative as I come down with flu symptoms but wasn't covid
[16:55:26] <fnutt> I've not had covid-19, nor been in quarantine, been close to an infected person etc.
[16:55:36] <fnutt> Not going to take the vaccine either.
[16:56:29] <fnutt> For me it's better to just reduce social contact and avoid being close to anyone outside.
[17:03:28] <Activ8> any particular reason not to take the vaccine?
[17:04:22] <richrd> I've been putting it off for no real rational reason but will probably get it soon especially if I get a negative test result
[17:08:14] <fnutt> Well, it's a vaccine that has not really been tested.
[17:08:46] <fnutt> We don't know the long term side effects.
[17:09:14] <fnutt> I'm not going to play lottery with my own body.
[17:16:55] <fnutt> I'm not against vaccines, but I don't want to put my health on play for taking vaccines that has not been tested over a long period of time.
[17:17:30] <fnutt> In other words - I take other messaurements to stay healthy and avoid covid-19 instead of taking vaccine.
[17:18:57] <srp> At least it's a rational reason to not take it.
[17:24:27] <richrd> I've been thinking that way too but by this point there's been at least hundreds of thousands of people who have received a vaccine 6 months ago without any issues
[17:24:47] <fnutt> About 350 out of 2,2 million people that took vaccine for swine flu sadly got narcolepsy. It was a quickly developed and "accepted" vaccine where the long term side effects was not revealed.
[17:25:06] <fnutt> (in Norway)
[17:25:15] <fnutt> Ref. https://legemiddelverket.no/nyheter/bivirkninger-av-vaksiner-hva-lerte-vi-av-pandemien-i-2009#hvor-mange-ble-vaksinert-med-pandemrix?
[17:25:19] <Activ8> mhm
[17:25:27] <richrd> I also thought about that and remember it well, but how soon did they get it after getting the vaccine?
[17:25:34] <fnutt> But it's just 6 months?
[17:27:06] <fnutt> Everyone has to make their own decision about what is right for them. Things to take into consideration should be your own health, your own needs, how many else in the country has taken vaccine, if there's a high likelyhood for you to be infected, if any close to you may become very ill if infected etc.
[17:28:01] <richrd> üíØ
[17:28:41] <fnutt> I did not take swine flu vaccine, and I'm very happy about that decision today. It was the right decision for me.
[17:29:09] <richrd> Same here :D
[17:29:10] <srp> I was too young to make that kind of decision, although I do remember the hype and everything.
[17:33:30] <fnutt> But, please don't listen too much on me. Taking the vaccine might be just the right decision for you. :)
[17:33:46] <srp> can we give fnutt a good noodle star?

[21:02:13] <MaxLeiter> please get the vaccine. far less dangerous long term than getting COVID. You can do research into mRNA if you‚Äôre skeptical but the tech makes sense
[21:03:13] <MaxLeiter> > About 350 out of 2,2 million people that took vaccine for swine flu sadly got narcolepsy
[21:03:21] <MaxLeiter> and swine flu killed hundreds of thousands

[23:25:20] <fnutt> For the planet, get vaccine. For your own health, consider the pros and cons. üòä
[23:27:20] <fnutt> ‚Äú far less dangerous long term than getting COVID‚Äù you don‚Äôt know yet since none knows what (if) the long term side effects are. 
[23:27:45] <bookworm> well, assuming you've ever used a care you have much worse odds there ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[23:27:50] <bookworm> a car*
[23:29:23] <fnutt> The worst thing to do is to do nothing - as in not grtting the vaccine OR not taking any actions regarding social distance and other messaurements.
[23:29:56] <fnutt> None should however be pressured to take the vaccine. 
[23:31:08] <bookworm> I've a different opinion on the matter, unless it's actually a health problem (as in reacting allergic to the transport / immune supressiva etc.)
[23:31:39] <bookworm> herd immunity only works if quite a lot of the people are vaccinated and that's needed for exactly those people
