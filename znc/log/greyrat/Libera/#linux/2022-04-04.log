[00:35:55] <Gustavo6046> So, until load average is 4, the 4th CPU thread (that is, thread #3) always has far more load than all of the other threads, which suggests that it tries to do everything on its own
[00:36:38] <Gustavo6046> once load average is 4 (which mind you, should mean ALL 4 threads under load; i.e. the thread 3 has 4 times the load it should!) the other cores start to have more activity too, suggesting thread 3 is finally yielding and shedding off work to threads 0, 1 and 2

[00:56:00] <va> Hi! Can I temporarily stop XTerm from scrolling down on output? I don't mean SIGSTOPing the running process. XY: I run a program that creates a lot of output that does not fit on a single screen, so I have to scroll up to the beginning (shift+pageup) of output and then scroll down to read the text in correct order, because XTerm scrolls to the bottom automatically. How can I stop the automatic
[00:56:02] <va> scrolling and stay at the line when I ran the command and then scroll down with shift+pagedown? I do not want to use another pager, such as less(1), because xterm(1) already is a pager somewhat.

[03:04:09] <Khaytsus> Maybe that explains why I originally had some confusion on some setup/options, maybe I was looking at 3.x docs ;)

[05:33:40] <phogg> sybariten: if you have a local X server on Windows you can ssh from your WSL2 bash shell and then run remote programs and have them display. All you should need is DISPLAY
[05:33:45] <phogg> and possibly some access control stuff
[05:33:48] <nvz> its written in python if I recall, uses some nx protocol or something, does all the ssh stuff for ya.. and it can run a single app and make it appear native on windows, and when connection gets interrupted it will put a spinner on the window til it restablishes.. and you can even attach/detach that app leaving it running in the background without it being visible on the windows mahcine

[05:34:50] <phogg> sybariten: set the DISPLAY environment variable to something which will map back to the port X is listening on, then ssh will pick up and forward that

[05:36:04] <nvz> sybariten: listen, I was using an orangepi lite one time as my only computer... its got like 512MB ram, I had a cheap usb wifi dongle in a soup strainer, getting wifi from lawd knows where, connecting over the internet on a shotty connection to a machine running windows 7 in virtualbox.. and I was using win7 as smoothly as if I were running it on real bare metal hardware on the other end

[06:01:38] <bullgard4> The Unicode consortium describes the Unicode 1F4A8 as the "DASH SYMBOL". My Hexchat program renders the associated symbol as 💨 . I do not know if your IRC client can resolve this symbol. The Unicode consortioum explains it as "briffits". My dictionary has no translation for "briffits" into my native language. So, please tell me, is this symbol to symbolize a somewhat defect Lady's stocking, a fast run through,
[06:01:38] <bullgard4> or a news ticker, or what?
[06:02:28] <rascul> nix does things very different from current mainstream distros, like arch did when it was new, like gentoo did when it was new, and they all began to flood support channels with distro specific stuff and holier-than-thou attitudes (though i haven't seen much of the attitude from nix users.... yet)

[09:43:50] <jim> conjo, ok. first, while we don't try to force people to "rtfm", it can be a good idea when you want to gain information. thing is, the material in man pages is reference-level reading material, which takes some skill to read and understand.

[09:45:07] <jim> you might read a random man page every day, to gain the skill of reading that kind of material. it's a good skill to have, and you want that skill
[09:47:08] <jim> second, the shell is an interface between the user (you) and the power represented by your linux installation. so, it's a good idea to understand the shell in detail, as much as you can.
[09:47:31] <conjo> agreed man can be hard to understand at times for me but its getting easier now that i pair it with google search of examples, tldr program, using grep in my man search's and the "/" to search for instances of what i want. Also trying to read a little each day about REGEX

[09:49:18] <budlight> how you liking Ubuntu conjo
[09:49:43] <conjo> found another site i think its call bash explain this, can be quite helpful but like you said needs background of bash as a subject and bash programming
[09:49:58] <conjo> i like it like i like my first bike with training wheels
[09:50:29] <conjo> it has served me well as an introductory, but i would like to become more keyboard based ultimately
[09:50:55] <budlight> jim have you use dkms to compile anything?
[09:51:22] <jim> third, while the shell does represent an interface to the ability represented by your linux installation, there are those who say the shell code is somewhat hard to read, and to write... so, I recommend you choose a -non- shell scripting language (like perl, python, lua, lots of others) to learn

[13:03:54] <Masklin> I am not wondering about the fs
[13:04:03] <bebna> ahh, that is for the paritition table to mark what type of format is in the partition
[13:04:18] <Jaruzo> I have two folders called 'cat' whose content is almost the same in two different HDDs. I would like to check the differences between these two, which file is missing from the other and which file although named the same has a larger size/newer modification date. however I can only use them one at a time, so I can't connect them both and just run a
[13:04:18] <Jaruzo> 'diff' command.
[13:04:43] <Jaruzo> is there any way I can do this

[13:05:28] *** Joins: gandhii (~gandhii@mobile-166-173-249-121.mycingular.net)
[13:05:50] <dirtyflag> for a diff you have to have both availabkle

[13:05:59] <dirtyflag> copy one in a usb stick ?
[13:06:19] <colo> Jaruzo, use `find` to record all important metadata in a text file per-disk, and then use diff on those text-files to compare the data in there
[13:06:29] <dirtyflag> Masklin: put a lable that makes sense, and then, mkfs

[16:53:41] <boosternath> Hi all, I have a .desktop with a MimeType entry (a ; delimited list of mimetypes) that is pretty long and unwieldy. According to the spec (https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-0.9.5.html), there might not be anything I can do to clean it up. Do you know if there's anything I could do to space the mimetype entries one per line?

[16:55:50] <boosternath> one idea is to store the mimetimes in a newline-delimited file, and dump them into the .desktop entry during build, but it would be nicer if my .desktop file contained that data and was readable

[18:20:04] <Ali_A> I did ask this question before, but I didn't get a reply (so I am re-asking) if I have a process running, its memory will consist of (stack segment, text segment, data segment, dynamic segment) maybe a bit more, but the stack is  basically a pre allocated memory for the process, and variables for each function is managed using the stack (if not
[18:20:04] <Ali_A> registers directly depending on the calling conventions), the data segment is basically a memory that is not bound to the stack (something like malloc calls) and static data (persist data, and maybe ROM) will probably also are allocated to somewhere in memory (maybe in the data segment as well) the thing, I am reading the SYSV ABI and it doesn't
[18:20:05] <Ali_A> mention anything about static data but only mentions the above mentioned segments. The dynamic segments are memory for shared objects (can be shared libraries). Is my understanding correct? if so, where does the memory that shared objects allocates goes to? (basically if I have a shared lib that allocates using malloc, does that goes into the data
[18:20:05] <Ali_A> segment or the dynamic segment)
[18:20:06] <Ali_A> the info I got where from SYSV ABI 32 bit page 48
[18:20:06] <Ali_A> (I know there are .data .bss .rdata and so on, those are sections and not segments, the OS only maps segments (which usually composed of multiple sections) to memory and does not directly map sections to memory. So I am just trying to be sure that my understanding is correct regarding this whole memory model for ELF executable)

[18:37:45] <bebna> I remember something about jump tables, where the os puts in a jump when the process calls a shared lib function and jumps to the page of that lib. Where the page of those lib is says the jump table, but where the pages are collected no clue. Perhaps the first process that uses it or a common place, it is dependend on the os and how it handles that. So google for linux kernel dynamic linking or
[18:37:47] <bebna> something like that

[18:53:11] <Ali_A> bebna thanks!
[18:53:11] <Ali_A> well, as far as I know jump table is something used to resolve references/symbols for dynamic linking and not related to where the memory is mapped during the process execution , but you are probably right, I should look at ASLR because I thought it would randomise the physical pages, or the start address of the process image but for example, the
[18:53:12] <Ali_A> ABI does say (for conventional reasons) the VMA of the .text segment should be 0x8048000. and it says the data segment should follow immediately, so I am not sure what is being randomised

[22:44:07] <suid_dumpable> beachpeach: well, good luck updating all your copies of zlib (recent example) spread across all those "portable" apps to fix security issues

[22:44:34] <beachpeach> It's not really a mission critical application. It's more like a compile-once and forget about it thing

I have a small problem, I have a server (Terraria) running on a Linux server and when I want to connect to it I need to connect to it using OpenVPN connection. But when I want my friends to connect to it I don't know how am I supposed to forward to it. I was thinking abou ssh port forwarding but don't know which arguments and how to set it up.
