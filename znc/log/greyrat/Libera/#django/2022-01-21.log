[03:32:50] <dre> Here's an annoying one:
[03:33:17] <dre> I have a view that handles a post / file upload. if form is valid, display the template, etc. all normal stuff.
[03:34:52] <dre> but, in that template, I want to display that same form again, hidden, and have the submit button to be like " Do X with Uploaded file" -- I effectively want to submit the same form to a differernt action, pre-populated with the previously uploaded file
[03:36:59] <dre> what I've tried: put the form in the "sub view", display form.as_hidden, wire up "do x" button to new view. but I get a key error, the form is not pre-loaded with the currently uploaded file.
[03:39:07] <GinFuyou> file input is for uploadING files not for uplodED ones, so you should probably use different form that references local media file
[03:41:13] <dre> you're right; I could put an empty field to find the temporary uploaded file or whatever; is it possible to reference it over requests?
[03:41:25] <dre> or do i have to save it to the temporary file?
[03:43:50] <GinFuyou> What is exactly the workflow? I thought you meant do something with file after uploading?
[03:45:08] *** Quits: cyphase (~cyphase@user/cyphase) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[03:45:35] <dre> GinFuyou, upload a file, check the "status" and "actions yet to do" and then you click a button to say "confirmed, do the things"
[03:45:55] <dre> I'm up to the "confirmed, do the things" part.
[03:46:30] <dre> when I click the button, I'm going to a new view, I don't have the file, but I'll pass in a reference to the previously uploaded file.
[03:46:52] <GinFuyou> Ok, then you already have uploaded file to work with
[03:47:41] <GinFuyou> Yeah, sounds fine, still have some not clear?
[03:48:01] <GinFuyou> *something
[03:49:07] <dre> how to reference it? |D
[03:52:07] <GinFuyou> If you upload file to django, it's usually tied to some model with file field, so most obvious way is refering it by model PK or other unique set of attributes
[03:52:19] <GinFuyou> Otherwise you have only file path\name
[03:54:49] <dre> I'll look into it, I'm wondering what's the deal when it's the "InMemoryUploadedFile" or whatever it is
[03:55:28] <dre> maybe I'll have to save it to a temporary file; but if I'm doing that, I may as well save the results, not the file itself.
[03:56:02] <GinFuyou> It exists only during upload process, before it's finaly stored

[03:57:17] <GinFuyou> So is the goal doesn't suppose having file stored at the end of last step?
[03:57:35] <dre> no, I don't need the file, just the outcomes of it
[03:58:31] <GinFuyou> Then yes, you either need to save temporary, or save data you get from it
[04:00:47] <dre> pythong tempfile.TemporaryFile - "It will be destroyed as soon as it is closed"
[04:00:59] <dre> oof that's not going to work for me
[04:01:14] <GinFuyou> No just use normal FileField
[04:01:29] <GinFuyou> And clear it when you done with file
[04:01:47] <dre> I have no models
[04:01:56] <dre> which is the issue; so far there's no DB use.
[04:02:24] <GinFuyou> eh, did said it earlier?
[04:02:33] <GinFuyou> That;s important
[04:03:13] <dre> yeah sorry, all I have is forms and views.
[04:04:07] <dre> I think the only way I could do it would be to have some sort of string that's thrown around, but it's not good.
[04:04:36] <GinFuyou> Why is it not good?
[04:04:53] <GinFuyou> Also you don't have sessions with like cache or cookies?
[04:05:19] <dre> I'd have sessions..
[04:05:20] <beastDivision> FunkyBob: thanks, I'm looking at dramatiq now. there seems to be a couple different options for a chron scheduler, do you have an experience or recomendations for that, which integrate into django?
[04:06:26] <GinFuyou> Well, then you have a kind of storage... but still you could just pass a file name or attribute that used to reconstruct it
[04:07:23] <beastDivision> or is that the bronski thing you refered to?
[04:09:36] <FunkyBob> beastDivision: depends on what you need... what do you consider 'integrate into django'?
[04:09:51] <FunkyBob> I wrote bronski so the client could manage cron tasks from within django
[04:10:11] <FunkyBob> and it ties into dramatiq quite neatly [though I really wish I'd gone with pluggable models from the start]
[04:10:35] <beastDivision> right now I heavily use the admin site interface for django celery beat, and scheudle a lot of tasks with sub-min and a few with sub-seconds frequency
[04:10:47] <FunkyBob> ouch
[04:11:03] <FunkyBob> given I was using cron syntax, bronski is only minute granularity
[04:11:09] <dre> GinFuyou, but the issue is where the file is uploaded and will it persist. looking into https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/files/uploads/
[04:12:33] <dre> so, if I was to use "TemporaryUploadedFile" that seems to be good, but when does the file get deleted?
[04:13:13] <dre> otherwise it would be almost perfect, because I could just set the TUF, put the filepath in a hiddenfield, and then on the next view, load the file and attempt to process it
[04:13:17] <beastDivision> hmmm, yeah, my tasks are pretty simple, they're just like, hey read the temperature on this thermometer every 15 seconds, or read this voltage every 100 ms. a little time jitter is fine in my use case. just got a lot of lab equipment i poll for data continuously, just looking to make it HA/distributed so that if the scheduler dies or whatever another container can automatically take over and I
[04:13:19] <beastDivision> don't end up with a loss of data overnight

[04:20:28] <dre> lab equipment is always tough to do
[04:22:35] <GinFuyou> dre, well, you delete it when you done with it. The problem I can see is unprocessed files, but you could cull them out periodically - with cron or by request
[04:22:39] <beastDivision> I mean, not really, if I were trying to do sub 50 ms stuff maybe, but like the majority of my stuff is on the order of 15 seconds or stuff, if I have a thermometer reading that is off by a few seconds or even an occasional miss, it doesn't matter at all.

[07:30:48] <tybug> Hi all :)  first time here, redirect me if I'm not in the right place.
[07:30:53] <tybug> I was wondering why django creates a new migration every time the `error_messages` attribute of a model field (not a form field!) is changed. For instance, if I have the following code: https://dpaste.org/UqSS, run `makemigrations`, and then edit it to fix the typo (`equired` -> `required`), running `makemigrations` again generates a new migration.
[07:30:53] <tybug> My understanding is that the `error_messages` attribute is not stored in the database at all, so I'm confused why django sees the need to generate a migration for it when only the error text has changed.

[17:00:04] <ktosiek> rhombus: shouldn't it be --module oeplatform.wsgi?
[17:00:31] <rhombus> moldy: I'm running it exactly as shown in the dpaste. From the root directory of the virtual environment, with the flags you see there.
[17:00:42] <moldy> hmm, interesting
[17:01:04] <moldy> rhombus: which value did you pass for --chdir?
[17:01:27] <rhombus> ktosiek: I don't know :) the documentation doesn't explain how things are named, they seem to rely heavily on a default setup using django-admin, but that's either not what happened here, or the configuration is very old
[17:02:10] <rhombus> moldy: no value. I am not providing --chdir. I'm following these instructions: https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/Django_and_nginx.html#test-your-django-project
[17:02:34] <moldy> rhombus: that's probably the problem :)
[17:03:40] <rhombus> moldy: but you'll note that those instructions I linked to don't mention that :)
[17:04:03] <moldy> rhombus: yes, they are imcomplete / do not apply to your situation
[17:04:18] <moldy> try following the documentation i linked to, in particular pass ``--chdir=/path/to/your/project``, given your wsgi file is in ``/path/to/your/project/oeplatform/wsgi.py``
[17:04:28] <rhombus> moldy: also, it seems odd that I would not have to provide information like that when using runserver.

[17:04:57] <rhombus> moldy: Forgive the question -- what is the path to my project?
[17:05:37] <moldy> the error message says uwsgi cannot find your wsgi module. if your wsgi module is in /path/to/your/project/oeplatform/oeplatform/wsgi.py, you need to tell uwsgi to look for it relative to /path/to/your/project
[17:05:42] <moldy> this is what --chdir should do
[17:05:53] <moldy> rhombus: well we cannot know :)
[17:06:21] <moldy> rhombus: it's the parent directory of `oeplatform`, where `oeplatform` is the directory that contains `wsgi.py`
[17:06:38] <rhombus> moldy: I'm in a directory named "oep-website", which has another directory called "oep-website" -- the bin/activate script is in there, so that's probably something generated by venv. But then there is a directory called oeplatform, that is the only one with anything suggestive of wsgi in it.
[17:06:56] <moldy> the command from the docs you linked to (``uwsgi --http :8000 --module mysite.wsgi``) will work if you are in the parent directory of ``mysite``
[17:06:57] <rhombus> okay, let me try specifying chdir with that path.
[17:07:50] <moldy> it might help if you show us the output of `tree` from the oep-website directory
[17:08:02] <rhombus> okay, just a moment
[17:08:28] <moldy> rhombus: note that in the docs you linked, there is this command you're told to run earlier: ``cd mysite``
[17:08:47] <moldy> which in your case would be ``cd /path/to/oep-website`` probably
[17:09:05] <moldy> --chdir tells uwsgi to do that itself on startup
[17:09:20] <rhombus> moldy: right, and that's the directory I've been running uwsgi in. (Which is another reason I thought the chdir was superfluous.)
[17:10:20] <rhombus> In any event, starting with --chdir=/path/to/oep-website gives me the same error.

[17:53:06] <rhombus> moldy: 'tree -I oep-website' and 'tree' give the same output, at least as far as the number of lines is concerned.
[17:53:20] <moldy> rhombus: yeah... read what i wrote just above.
[17:54:09] <moldy> delete your venv directories (be careful not to nuke anything else, or make sure you have another copy of it), recreate the venv in a dedicated location
[17:54:10] <rhombus> moldy: what do you mean by "directory of its own"? One outside the project path?
[17:55:20] <rhombus> moldy: okay -- hang on. I'm not going to start blowing away the venv. This doesn't make any sense to me. It works when started with runserver. How hard can it be to get this working with uwsgi?
[17:55:58] <moldy> either that, or if you have it inside the project, give it a subdirectory of its own. call it ``venv`` or such.
[17:56:30] <rhombus> moldy: it has a subdirectory of its own: oep-website
[17:56:42] <moldy> you're using a rather non-standard and confusing structure that can lead to naming conflicts and probably also to other errors, such as the one you pasted above
[17:56:48] <rhombus> moldy: the path to the venv is ~/oep-website/oep-website
[17:56:58] <moldy> ok so oep-website is the venv, and *only* the venv? no other stuff in there?
[17:57:33] <Wooble> rhombus: can you paste the output of tree -L 2?
[17:57:56] <rhombus> Wooble: from the project root?
[17:57:58] <Wooble> yeah
[17:58:17] <rhombus> moldy: I believe so, hang on, I'll paste the truncated tree command output
[17:59:32] <Wooble> (going as deep as -L 3 might also work without showing every single thing in the venv...)
[18:01:02] <rhombus> moldy: Wooble here is tree -L 3 from the project root:  https://dpaste.com//AR6PB52UW
[18:06:09] <moldy> regarding the latest error, google suggests that a missing __init__.py file is a common cause for this
[18:06:32] <Wooble> yeah I was just about to suggest "touch login/__init__.py"
[18:06:37] <moldy> +1
[18:07:19] <Wooble> although that error is so stupid I can't believe it. how does it think foo/./bar and foo/bar are 2 separate paths? :)
[18:07:40] <moldy> some namespace package foo i guess
[18:07:48] <rhombus> Wooble: I gotta say, so far I am not impressed with uwsgi. It has a real "sealing wax and string" feel to it. The documentation is terrible.
[18:08:08] <moldy> you may want to take a look at gunicorn if you want something simpler
[18:08:32] <moldy> to be fair, your current issue is not a uwsgi one though
[18:08:48] <rhombus> Wooble: moldy: Okay, touched __init__.py and the console error is gone, at least
[18:08:58] <Wooble> yeah I followed a ridiculously long and detailed step-by-step tutorial to set up uwsgi, got frustrated trying to add a 2nd app and just threw it away and went to gunicorn
[18:09:00] <moldy> alright, then on to the next error ;)
[18:09:23] <rhombus> moldy: let me try hitting the index page, one second.
[18:09:28] <Wooble> (not that I don't appreciate the effort it took to create that, ChrisWarrick! :) )
[18:09:55] <moldy> iirc there was some talk about adding a warning if namespace packages are present, but it looks like it wasn't implemented so far

[18:10:47] <Wooble> almost no one ever wants a namespace package; making it easy to accidentally create them was a weird design choice.
[18:10:48] <moldy> fwiw, your directory naming is rather non-standard and may lead to confusion, especially if you are reading documentation that assumes a different structure
[18:10:53] <rhombus> moldy: Okay, progress! No more "Internal Server Error"! I get the HTML from the index page. The CSS is missing and a bunch of images are broken. Could be a path issue of some sort.

[18:12:43] <rhombus> moldy: This was with uwsgi just now.
[18:13:08] <Wooble> rhombus: the wsgi server doesn't serve your static files like runserver does; you need to serve those separately and manage.py collectstatic collects them for you :)
[18:13:24] <moldy> rhombus: ok, that's good. check https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/howto/static-files/deployment/ for serving static files in production

[20:46:20] <hzm74> Has anybody a direction where i can find how to set this up with examples?
[20:46:33] <hzm74> I found this: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/forms/fields/#django.forms.ModelChoiceField
[20:47:14] <dang`r`us> if you want field 2 to depend on field 1 on the same page without a reload you'll have to roll your own, otherwise probably use some wizard library (there used to be one in Django, lemme search)
[20:47:15] <hzm74> But for me as a beginner it is a little bit hard to follow.
[20:47:40] <dang`r`us> one page without reload = not really Django's strength, it's very much a request-response oriented framework
[20:47:51] <dang`r`us> wizard: https://django-formtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wizard.html
[20:48:18] <dang`r`us> it's not a beginner-friendly topic either way
[20:50:53] <hzm74> dang`r`us  Thnx for the response. First look at it is that it is also not beginner-friendly
