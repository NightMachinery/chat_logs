[16:38:38] <opal> the gpl isn't cc-by-nc
[16:38:48] <opal> we weren't talking about cc-by-nc at all
[16:39:12] <kompowiec2[x]> Well i'm not a expet lawyer therefore i ask
[16:39:27] <kompowiec2[x]> I understand

[16:39:30] <opal> nor am i, being one isnt required to keep up with a conversation
[16:40:22] <lts> If you want to license your work with CC-BY-NC, say "The script and its source code is licensed with CC-BY-NC". GPL is a completely different license
[16:40:24] <joepublic> The extra conditions mentioned above also make it difficult to exercise freedoms 2 and 3
[16:41:46] <kompowiec2[x]> Ok, i gotcha now that GPL isn't easily to modify. understandable
[16:42:47] <kompowiec2[x]> it would be difficult to create a license modification that would not violate the 4 essential freedoms
[16:42:55] <joepublic> More specifically in this case, from that link, '“Free software” does not mean “noncommercial”. On the contrary, a free program must be available for commercial use, commercial development, and commercial distribution.'
[16:44:05] <opal> yeah gplv2 "additional terms" and "automatic licensing of downstream recipients" explicitly disallow those restrictions
[16:44:46] <opal> ah i can't find this guy's email
[16:44:48] <joepublic> opal, what work are you looking at with those restrictions? curious

[20:18:20] <clever> rpi-open-firmware is a fork of the original one, it can boot linux on a pi2 or pi3, but cant do any graphics

[20:18:40] <leah> this is really nice
[20:18:44] <clever> so ive been moving the features over to lk-overlay, and adding more as i go
[20:19:07] <leah> you said: "more", then you said: rpi-open-firmware

[20:19:49] <leah> yes i know of christina. alyssa rosenzweig was doing stuff with this back in 2016 but i think she abandoned this
[20:19:54] <clever> i forked that repo, fixed some bugs, added a few features, but found some design limits with it

[20:21:01] <leah> you are very clever

[20:21:20] <clever> :D
[20:21:31] <leah> so could i try it by building what's in those repositories?

[20:26:19] <leah> and cross compile
[20:26:34] <clever> yeah
[20:26:49] <clever> i havent fixed arm->vpu cross compile yet
[20:26:51] <leah> you know, i've never even ran X on a raspberry pi
[20:26:53] <clever> so you must use an x86 host
[20:27:11] <leah> i've only ever installed minimal distros without X, and just used ssh
[20:27:26] <leah> for temporary servers, and occasionally spi flashing
[20:27:28] <clever> when using rpi-open-firmware, thats the most you can do
[20:27:38] <clever> the gfx hw cant be used under that codebase
[20:28:20] <clever> when you turn on the rpi, it will first run a mask rom inside the SoC
[20:28:32] <clever> that mask rom will load bootcode.bin from the SD card, and execute it
[20:28:50] <clever> it gets stored in the L2 cache, using normal cache-as-ram techniques, so your limited to 128kb of ram
[20:29:20] <clever> the official bootcode.bin is ~52kb, and it supports booting from sd, usb, and tftp
[20:29:43] <clever> it brings the dram controller online, then loads start.elf from one of those 3, depending on several factors

[20:31:33] <clever> leah: this creates an open replacement, rename lk.bin to bootcode.bin, and it can bring the ram online, then load+execute lk.elf from an ext2 partition on an SD card
[20:32:07] <clever> but to speed up development, ive been cheating a bit, the official (closed) bootcode.bin can load .elf files over the network
[20:32:20] <clever> so i can just compile, and reset
[20:32:56] <clever> so it just depends on if you want to constantly be swapping SD cards, or lean on closed-source a bit

[20:40:56] <leah> re-do as in, add another buck converter or something?

[20:43:55] <clever> leah: main reason i'm working on rpi-open-firmware, rather then just jumping to another ship, is the massive pre-existing user-base
[20:44:05] <leah> so it's more hackable
[20:44:15] <leah> yeah raspberry pi is huge
[20:44:34] <leah> yeah well, you know who i am right? and you know i love the raspberry pi, because of that :)
[20:44:39] <leah> your project will benefit me greatly
[20:44:45] <clever> dont know who you are outside of irc
[20:44:52] <leah> because now i can recommend the raspberry pi without feeling morally bankrupt
[20:45:16] <leah> i'll play with your software later, and provide feedback
[20:45:57] <clever> there are only 2 real major problems left to fix, before it becomes a useful candidate, and makes the rpi equivelant to some other SBC's
[20:46:04] <leah> in libreboot.org i'm telling how to use a raspberry pi simply because lots of people already own it. but now i can wholeheartedly recommend it, if your software works well
[20:46:05] <clever> 1: the video output
[20:46:23] <clever> 2: there is an SD card reliability problem, where linux just randomly wont see it
[20:46:33] <leah> rpi has spi on it, so you can use it to reprogram 25xx chips
[20:46:45] <clever> if i fix both of those, then you can boot to X11, get ethernet/usb, and use it like most other SBC's

[20:47:01] <leah> but you still need that gpu blob. your project solves this
[20:47:03] <clever> you wont have wifi/bt/h264, but thats still a good starting point
[20:47:29] <clever> leah: oh, and if you just want spi, i have other plans along that route
[20:47:35] <leah> oh?
[20:47:43] <clever> i have plans, on how to make a custom bootcode.bin, that you boot on something like a pi0
[20:47:53] <clever> once booted, it will identify itself as a usb flashrom programmer

[20:48:47] <kompowiec2[x]> Or just buy libre computer board
[20:48:53] <clever> 1: a usb serial port, 2: https://www.flashrom.org/Serprog
[20:49:11] <bandali> hey opal, sorry just saw your message
[20:49:30] <clever> leah: with just those 2 pices of software, a pi0 can become a usb flashing adapter, with no blobs involved
[20:50:10] <clever> if you can deal with extracting crypto keys, you can also do the exact same thing on a pi4 or even a pi400

[20:53:20] <clever> bootcode.bin, start.elf, recovery.bin and start4.elf
[20:53:43] <clever> bootcode.bin and recovery.bin both run directly from the rom, so no modifiable blobs are involved
[20:53:51] <clever> (the rom loads and runs them)
[20:54:22] <clever> start.elf and start4.elf, get loaded by a previous stage, that has to first initialize the ram
[20:54:59] <clever> the start.elf mode, can be ran by either the open or closed bootcode.bin, so you have a lot of choice
[20:55:11] *** Joins: OMYasuda (~OMYasuda@189.79.81.145)
[20:55:20] <clever> start4.elf however, can only be ran by the closed-source eeprom firmware, since i lack a DDR4 driver
[20:55:55] <clever> leah: in all 4 modes, you then have a wide range of modules you can enable/disable at compile time, to customize the binary to suit whatever your needs are
[20:56:56] <clever> bootcode.bin and start.elf mode, work on the entire VC4 lineup, pi0 to pi3
[20:57:07] <clever> recovery.bin and start.elf work on the 2711 line, pi4, pi400, cm4
[20:57:12] <clever> recovery.bin and start4.elf work on the 2711 line, pi4, pi400, cm4

[20:59:54] <clever> kompowiec2[x]: the reason i'm not just jumping to a proper open board, is that every existing rpi user, can trivially jump to the open firmware, for zero cost, by just re-flashing the SD card
[21:00:24] <clever> kompowiec2[x]: switching to a more open board, means the end-users have to buy that board, which makes the user-base grow more slowly

[21:05:20] <clever> kompowiec2[x]: there is also a pipe-dream, if i get loadable module support in my firmware, then in theory, the blob code (h264, isp) that broadcom refuses to release source for, could just become plugins for my open firmware
[21:05:35] <clever> kompowiec2[x]: and then the official firmware, would be mostly open, with some optional closed modules

[21:09:09] <clever> kompowiec2[x]: RPF has also shown some signs of wanting to open things
[21:09:22] <clever> they moved the 2d video stack from blob to linux source
[21:09:42] <clever> the h265 decoder skipped the blob stage entirely, and only has linux source
[21:09:59] <clever> but, they are still refusing to release docs for either component, all you get is source (with some comments)
[21:10:27] <kompowiec2[x]> Yeah i don't mind to rpi foundation, but yoh know, they are related to broadcom..
[21:10:28] <clever> the CSI peripheral (part of the camera system) is also in linux now, mostly so a 3rd-party can add drivers for other camera chips
[21:10:58] <kompowiec2[x]> you*
[21:11:03] <clever> but the ISP (the brains of the camera system) is still in blob land, and has been stated that it will never get source
[21:11:26] <clever> the ISP deals with debayer, lens artifacts, whitebalance, and helps with some h264 tasks
[21:12:21] <kompowiec2[x]> Tbh rpi camera isn"t so imporant IMO, because you can run any camera from usb
[21:12:52] <kompowiec2[x]> I had rpi but i sell it, because this damage my microsd cards
[21:12:57] <clever> kompowiec2[x]: i think a lot of usb cameras, only provide h264 streams, to get around the bandwidth limits
[21:13:16] <belgin> i thought it was mjpeg
[21:13:19] <kompowiec2[x]> I sold*
[21:13:20] <clever> but with a CSI camera, you can get the raw video at perfect quality, which may be better for computer-vision tasks
