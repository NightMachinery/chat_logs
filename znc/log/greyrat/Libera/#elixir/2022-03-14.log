[16:57:48] <trafficjam> hey guys, say i define a "products" table, with fields :name, :price, :quantity, and then a few months later realize i instead need a "product_version" table with fields :product_id, :name, :quantity. Is is possible to do with migrtion using ecto?
[16:58:37] <benwilson512> trafficjam: you want that instead of the first table?
[16:58:40] <benwilson512> or in addition to?
[17:00:54] <trafficjam> benwilson512: in addition to, but i want to move data from "products" to "product_versions"
[17:01:02] <trafficjam> at least some columns
[17:01:35] <trafficjam> basically i've only ever done really simple migrations, e.g. adding/removing/renaming a table or table column
[17:01:44] <trafficjam> and i'm wondering just how flexible phoenix migrations are
[17:02:19] <trafficjam> like my concern is that if i have to do a large schema rewrite, i have no idea how to do this in a migration (specifically moving data between tables, that sort of thing)
[17:02:40] <benwilson512> trafficjam: yeah the major question is if you can take the site offline for a few minutes or not
[17:04:48] <benwilson512> basically you have two options. The easy option is: You write a migration and a new code version that uses the new tables. Then you take the site down, make the new table, copy the data over, then turn the site back on with the new code
[17:04:59] <benwilson512> then you can later delete the old table at your leisure
[17:05:10] <benwilson512> the 0 downtime option is more complicated, I'd only recommend it if you must do 0 downtime
[17:08:32] <trafficjam> benwilson512: well i guess im asking about the scenario where i can't really take the site down, i.e. where it's popular enough that it needs to have 100% uptime
[17:08:50] <Nicd> I'd worry about that when you have that problem
[17:10:29] <trafficjam> Nicd: or where the service is critical enough that despite having a small number of users, it also should have 100% uptime
[17:11:07] <trafficjam> ignore the thing about being popular enough, i should've said "where it's critical to always be up"
[17:11:24] <trafficjam> whether thats due to popularity or service-related
[17:14:39] <benwilson512> right so the high level summary is this
[17:15:38] <benwilson512> 1) Deploy a migration to make the new table
[17:15:38] <benwilson512> 2) Deploy code that writes to the existing tables, and then also the new tables
[17:15:38] <benwilson512> 3) Backfill the new tables
[17:15:38] <benwilson512> 4) Deploy code that only uses the new tables
[17:15:38] <benwilson512> 5) Deploy a migration that deletes the old tables
[17:15:46] <benwilson512> step 2 is the hardest
[17:15:54] <benwilson512> you have to basically have code that supports both table sets at once
[17:16:12] <benwilson512> but doesn't _rely_ on the new tables, it just starts writing to them
[17:17:14] <benwilson512> one upside of this approach though is that it is also compatible with rolling or blue green deploys
[17:17:22] <trafficjam> man that sounds potentially like a lot of queries that you have to replicate
[17:17:37] <benwilson512> yes, this is why major table restructuring is hard if you can't tolerate downtime
[17:18:59] <trafficjam> have you needed to do this personally for your business?
[17:19:32] <trafficjam> which is one, i imagine, where do you certainly need 100% uptime
[17:19:36] <trafficjam> *where you
[17:20:12] <benwilson512> well you'd be surprised what you put in an enterprise contract actually :D We do have a window for scheduled downtime on weekends, database upgrades would be much much harder with out it
[17:20:13] <benwilson512> however
[17:20:20] <benwilson512> we've had to do similar things with some of our very large tables
[17:23:31] <trafficjam> ah that is suprising :) how did it go with the large tables? did you write duplicate queries for the new tables in phoenix?
[17:25:41] <benwilson512> you don't have to duplicate the queries, you have to duplicate the inserts and updates
[17:26:20] <trafficjam> sorry thats what i meant to say
[17:26:51] <trafficjam> i suppose it depends on the application, some apps probably don't need that many duplicates, while others need a lot
[17:29:45] <benwilson512> yeah I mean
[17:30:18] <benwilson512> I'd hold on to the ability to do some sort of after hours downtime as long as possible
[17:30:34] <benwilson512> it simplifies some of these questions enormously
[17:36:57] *** Joins: Sgeo (~Sgeo@user/sgeo)
[17:40:29] <trafficjam> benwilson512: maybe my intuition is off on this, but don't most websites have 100%? (ignoring unforced issues like server crashes, etc)
[17:40:35] <trafficjam> *100% uptime
[17:40:52] <trafficjam> *most popular websites at any rate
[17:41:48] <trafficjam> like i can't imagine any social media, ecommerce, popular saas sites going down for a couple of hours of planned maintenance
[17:42:39] <trafficjam> especially popular saas websites, on which many businesses rely
[17:52:20] <wink> counterpoint: apple.com (ecommerce) and banks
[17:52:47] <wink> apple isn't 'down' but they actually make the updating a process evert big release if I am not mistaken
[17:53:15] <Nicd> I'd say most sites go down for maintenance periodically
[17:53:50] <trafficjam> wink: you mean devices or their website?
[17:54:12] <trafficjam> Nicd: even large social media / ecommerce / popular saas websites?
[17:54:44] <trafficjam> like how could a service like Stripe have any downtime?
[17:55:20] <Nicd> yet my bank has regular downtimes
[17:55:57] <wink> trafficjam: when they add a lot of new stuff to their catalogue the shop part is actively down for maintenance
[17:56:21] <wink> just saying, it's one counterpoint example. and banks still have tons of overnight batch jobs
[17:59:01] <trafficjam> that's fair
[17:59:57] <wink> but I mean that's not necessarily bad
[18:00:16] <wink> you can have your API hopefully available 99% or more, but the backend only work every nighty
[18:00:35] <wink> so I think you can't just look at all those things as a closed system
[18:01:16] <wink> also ecommerce. as long as your "customer hits order" arrives in the DB or a buffer they might not even notice you only get your backend up again a day later. or, surprise, weekends
[18:01:29] <wink> only jsut in time stuff is bad :P
[18:02:36] <benwilson512> trafficjam: "most popular websites at any rate" most popular social media sites employee hundreds of engineers
[18:03:09] <Nicd> I remember our national railway's webshop used to be closed every night from 23.30 to 6.00 :D
[18:03:29] <wink> that sounds very German
[18:04:31] <Nicd> Finnish, we also like bureaucracy

[18:08:30] <trafficjam> benwilson512: yeah good point
[18:08:43] <trafficjam> maybe it's more common than i thought
[18:14:28] <trafficjam> benwilson512: quick question regarding absinthe: if i want to make a nested query, something like products { products { categories { created_by[user] { username } } } }, would i have to perform 3 joins in my context query?
[18:14:46] <benwilson512> you would not
[18:14:54] <trafficjam> ah
[18:15:01] <benwilson512> you don't need to load all of those in a single sql query, in fact you probably shouldn't
[18:15:05] <trafficjam> that's what i've been doing for all my nested queries lol
[18:15:07] <benwilson512> you'd have each resolver load only what it needs
[18:15:34] <trafficjam> oh ok
[18:17:10] <trafficjam> guess i need to have another read of the absinthe docs, thanks
