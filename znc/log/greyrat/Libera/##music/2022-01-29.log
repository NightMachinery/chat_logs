[18:50:00] <TomatoSynth> that should work
[18:50:22] <TomatoSynth> you're basically using the external mixer as a send/return buss artao
[18:50:34] <artao> and for my hardware
[18:50:47] <TomatoSynth> i do the same with a multi fx unit. even use the same outs, heh.
[18:51:23] <artao> the mixer has a pre- and post-send, but if I use them that way I wouldn't be able to record the external hardware
[18:51:40] <artao> so i'll hafta apply any effects to the whole mix ... which is fine, for some things
[18:51:45] <artao> glitching
[18:52:02] <artao> stuftter edit 2. everything from Freakshow Industries. and Glitchmachines
[18:53:04] <artao> Ideally tho, i get either an external recorder or an audio interface with 4 inputs
[18:57:16] <artao> also kinda wishin i'd spent a bit more and got a 14 or 16 ch mixer. I've already used all 10 channels on this one (2 mono and 4 stereo)
[18:58:08] <artao> and that's without plugging in my mc
[18:58:09] <artao> mic
