[01:49:26] <bookworm> harleypig: re favicon yes and no. Yes by telling your proxy to serve a different file or to patch the code. Re testing ident, you can do the query manually with netcat or what have you

[03:26:26] <Aye> bookworm, in my case it was out of being used to it - since some clients broke when ZNC disconnected from a network. it's no longer the case, and I've disabled it due to this reason
[03:30:10] <Aye> there's another question in that case, would it be acceptable to at least modify the notifications so they hint it's actually a kick? it can be misleading the way it's done imo

[04:00:37] <Aye> https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/commit/867fff33c093144965c4a3ded552a2313f1574c9 is the culprit of it?
[04:01:13] <ic> Aye, after dragging around elements in devtools, it seems to be the issue
[04:02:32] <MaxLeiter> hm, could be an android specific problem

[04:04:36] <MaxLeiter> I have no android device or linux box at the moment, so any debugging you can do is appreciated
[04:04:49] <MaxLeiter> I'd say its a CSS issue but that's an interesting one 
[04:04:55] <ic> i think it's element order?
[04:05:06] <ic> the user list appears to be entirely under the messages
[04:05:11] <Aye> yes, it's element order
[04:05:23] <ic> setting zindex would probably fix it, lemme test
[04:05:36] <ic> i should install vue devtools
[04:06:13] <ic> yeah z-index: 1; fixes it
[04:08:10] <Aye> would just adding the z-index be an acceptable fix?
[04:08:50] <MaxLeiter> Submit a PR and we can test on a few browsers to make sure

[22:42:41] <PendulumSwinger> If you have TL listening on all interfaces (i.e., 0.0.0.0), then you will be able to bypass the reverse proxy. You can make TL listen only on local host to restrict traffic to pass through nginx
[22:43:43] <PendulumSwinger> The relevant config setting is `host`: https://thelounge.chat/docs/configuration

[22:57:41] <Snuupy> I didn't realize people actually used it
[22:57:53] <Snuupy> I wrote it for some guys in a channel and they just gave up
[22:57:56] <Snuupy> I guess it was too long for them
[22:59:17] <Snuupy> let me know if you want me to make any edits or improvements to the doc
[23:02:10] <archpc> you guys are going to laugh at me
[23:03:00] <Snuupy> nah none of this is intuitive, I spent days setting up thelounge the first time around

[23:03:26] <archpc> "ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain.com/fullchain.pem;"

[23:03:35] <archpc> i didn't change the domain.com
[23:03:38] <archpc> also, docker as a pita
[23:03:40] <archpc> but now
[23:03:41] <archpc> IT WORKS
[23:03:43] <Snuupy> yes you have to change domain.com to your domain
[23:03:52] <archpc> my eyesight isn't the best :v
[23:04:07] <Snuupy> yes when dealing with computers you should read through the lines of code you're copy pasting ;)
[23:04:18] <Snuupy> I'll bold the domain.com portion
[23:04:24] <archpc> Hahaha
[23:04:43] <archpc> Snuupy, your documentation though is very good!
[23:05:04] <Snuupy> updated 
[23:06:13] <Snuupy> I'm glad you think so, I wasn't sure if people were going to be able to follow it through
[23:06:30] <archpc> I'm not the sharpest bulb in the fridge and I followed it pretty well
[23:07:15] <archpc> also kudos for being transparent about your referrals
[23:08:13] <Snuupy> eh if people use it great, if they don't idc

[23:11:23] <Snuupy> 01:40:38 PM <archpc> so the container still works on domain.com:9000 without nginx, it seems it had 0 effect
[23:11:49] <Snuupy> one of the features of nginx is to bind to an interface, in this case you can bind it to localhost
[23:12:09] <Snuupy> if you do that, thelounge will only work with your reverse proxy (because your reverse proxy is running on localhost)
[23:12:22] <Snuupy> I can add that in but I thought people would have a harder time troubleshooting if reverse proxy wasn't working
[23:12:34] <archpc> Snuupy, what would I change to have that setup?
[23:12:44] <Snuupy>     ports:
[23:12:45] <Snuupy>       - "127.0.0.1:9000:9000"
