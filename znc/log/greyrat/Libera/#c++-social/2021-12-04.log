[14:12:01] <Renderwww> https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/ line goes down
[14:12:15] <Renderwww> I hope this time it means I get to buy a graphics card
[14:17:20] <Faux> THE LINE
[14:17:29] <Faux> I am enjoying my new graphics card.
[14:17:36] <Faux> I am wondering if it's time to start using a compositor on linux.
[14:18:36] <Carbonflux> how did you get your hands on a new graphics card?
[14:19:03] <Faux> I paid 2x msrp for a non-top-end card.
[14:19:47] <Faux> (loreal commercial playing in the background)
[14:19:57] <Carbonflux> ah well, i was hopping for better news. What kind is it?
[14:21:36] <Faux> 6600xt; the newer, lower-clocked, cheaper version of the amd flagshit cards.
[14:21:57] <Renderwww> at least it's not nvidia
[14:22:05] <Renderwww> you could even try shit like wayland
[14:22:13] <Faux> I wanted to try amd 'cos it's been a decade or so.
[14:22:23] <Carbonflux> thats not to bad
[14:22:26] <Faux> And I linux desktop all day.
[14:22:44] <Renderwww> you probably run derpian stable with 5 year out of date drivers
[14:22:53] <Carbonflux> looks like Amazon has 4 3080's in stock, 2,400$
[14:23:21] <Faux> Renderwww: Hah. I run Ubuntu 6mo so it's typically only about one year out of date.
[14:23:41] <Renderwww> with amd you kinda want a recent kenel and recent mesa
[14:23:45] <Faux> 470 is the recommended driver version.
[14:24:03] <Carbonflux> i have been happy with AMD.
[14:24:10] *** Joins: CaCode- (~CaCode@user/cacode)
[14:24:48] <Renderwww> 470?
[14:25:02] <Renderwww> I thought it's all in the kernel and mesa and whatnot
[14:25:03] <Faux> nVidia, in Ubuntu. 472 is the latest Windows driver, although it looks like 470 was released in around May.
[14:25:16] <Carbonflux> looks like you can use a nvidia 3080 on geforce now if you get the pro sub.
[14:25:47] <Carbonflux> i keep wondering if this is there way of keeping the card out of the hands of the miners.
[14:26:02] <Faux> And Ubuntu 6mo is on kernel 5.13 and mesa 21.2.2, no idea how out of date that is compared to other non-HEAD distros.
[14:26:34] <Renderwww> sounds rather up to date
[14:26:41] *** Quits: CaCode_ (~CaCode@user/cacode) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[14:26:58] <Faux> It's normally good enough that it doesn't bother me.
[14:27:08] <Renderwww> I'm at 21.2.5 and 5.14.16
[14:27:37] <Carbonflux> i am using 21.5.2
[14:28:18] <Faux> Yeah. You'll probably be further ahead in 4 months, where I will still be using exactly these versions (as 6mo is Oct / April).
[14:28:26] * Renderwww cries in RX 580
[14:28:28] <Carbonflux> looks like there is a 21.10 out now
[14:30:37] <Faux> Renderwww: I know you can afford it, but I support your decision not to upgrade.
[14:30:38] <Renderwww> Faux: are you playing on loonix exclusively or are you one of those filthy dualbooters
[14:31:16] <Faux> I dualboot for AAAA. If something is platinum on crossplay I'll give it a go but if it doesn't work first time I just reboot.
[14:31:55] <Renderwww> well, I can't play anything modern on my ultra wide meme monitor in the native resolution but I have another computer hooked up to my telly which plays most things reasonably
[14:32:01] <Renderwww> disgusting
[14:32:06] <Faux> My Windows install is super fucked if that helps.
[14:32:19] <Faux> Barely fit for purpose and never used.

[14:34:33] <Carbonflux> i think cloud gaming is really becoming a good option. Let them buy the graphics cards and maintain them.
[14:35:23] <Carbonflux> i noticed some people on reddit figured out the machine specs luna is using, Xeon and Tesla's, total overkill.
[14:35:53] <Renderwww> maybe they run multiple games on a single video card
[14:36:03] <Carbonflux> hm
[14:36:14] <Renderwww> also I'm still not sure about the whole latency thing
[14:36:28] <Renderwww> and comperssion artifacts
[14:36:36] <Carbonflux> well, its fast here, but you have a point.
[14:36:59] <Carbonflux> ya, the compression artifacts are the main issue imo
[14:37:08] <Carbonflux> but that is a work in progress.
[14:37:09] <Renderwww> also no modding
[14:37:14] <Carbonflux> some games look good
[14:37:26] <Carbonflux> Control looks great on luna
[14:37:30] <Carbonflux> true
[14:37:57] <Carbonflux> and no console.
[14:37:58] <Faux> I did enjoy that first review of Stadia which said that latency was the opposite way around to what you'd expect, twitchy FPS games were absolutely fine, as the game already has internet latencies in multiplayer, and local puzzle games, like World Of Goo, were absolutely unusable garbage, as you had to use a mouse cursor to click on thinks and it was agony.
[14:38:13] <Faux> I don't approve of cloud gaming; wrong type of subscription / purchase nonsense.
[14:38:38] <Faux> If you can make some savings and actually pass them on to the consumer then please do, but no rape for convenience tyvm.
[14:38:50] <Carbonflux> well it does bring us back to the mainframe model
[14:39:03] <Carbonflux> but my personal experience has been good so far.
[14:41:12] <Faux> Heh, t3. or spot style pricing for gaming machines.

[15:00:02] <Renderwww> everyone will start working on weekends and the night shift because gaming in the evening and on weekends will be too expensive!
[15:00:22] <Faux> Sounds good to me.
[15:01:04] <Faux> Just noticed my new shiny gaming monitor is energy rated "G", on a scale of "G" to "A++". It isn't even warm. My old monitor is basically a space heater in comparison. I wonder what the old one would rate today.
[15:01:57] <Renderwww> maybe your old one was actually sold as a heater

[15:08:43] <Carbonflux> heh
[15:10:53] <Renderwww> regarding the teslas for stadia, another reason could be that the nvidia consumer card drivers have a provision in the eula that they can't be used in data centers or some crap like that
[15:12:00] <Faux> Might be that the consumer cards are rated for 2h/day of load for 100 days and then the warranty expires; and the teslas are rated for 24h/day of load for two years.
[15:12:55] <Faux> I turned the FPS on in Outer Worlds and the character dialog bits are lower FPS than the main game, I suspect due to video effects (blur etc.) and hair.
[15:13:22] <Renderwww> "No Datacenter Deployment. The SOFTWARE is not licensed for datacenter deployment, except that blockchain processing in a datacenter is permitted."
[15:15:01] <Renderwww> https://www.nvidia.com/content/DriverDownload-March2009/licence.php?lang=us&type=GeForce
[15:15:03] <Carbonflux> well, i do know that the Geforce now cloud gaming is offering 3080s 
[15:15:27] <Renderwww> obviously nvidia isn't limited by that retarded clause
[15:15:41] <Renderwww> I wonder if that would hold in courts here
[15:15:52] <Carbonflux> i hear the 3080s are huge power hogs.
[15:17:00] <Carbonflux> hm, i never realized that was a thing.
