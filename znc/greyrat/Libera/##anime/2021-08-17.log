[02:09:12] <MootPoot> I could get both down
[02:09:16] <ButterNoodle> I would leave it

[02:09:47] <MootPoot> idk

[02:10:46] <ButterNoodle> with 18" of travel.. probably 1/2" is not gonna make a big difference overall but.. u just run out of travel and possible put the tire into parts of the bike it wasnt meant to go into

The name's etymological origin is the Greek word ·ΩÑŒ≥Œ∫ŒøœÇ, meaning 1. "burden, volume, mass" and 2. "barb", and the Greek word ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÇ, meaning "study".

[04:59:57] <MootPoot> I have questions
[05:00:12] <MootPoot> uncle noodle
[05:00:18] <MootPoot> or well, emmeka  would work as well
[05:00:46] <emmeka> questions about what
[05:00:53] <MootPoot> campin/ fieldcraft
[05:01:10] <MootPoot> you're a tree person right
[05:01:40] <emmeka> I know a fair amount about trees. why
[05:01:47] <MootPoot> 3-4 day trip max, 35L internal frame backpack. It seems to be good enough for everything but my problem is sleeping
[05:01:56] <MootPoot> my cotton sleeping bag is wayy to bulky
[05:02:01] <MootPoot> so I was thinking
[05:02:07] <MootPoot> would a wool blanket work in the field
[05:02:13] <MootPoot> what happens if it gets wet
[05:02:28] <MootPoot> or if I buy a bunch of cheap mylar blankets and just stack em
[05:02:29] <ButterNoodle> 850 down
[05:02:36] <MootPoot> expensive
[05:02:36] <emmeka> what does this question have to do with trees though
[05:02:37] <ButterNoodle> packs tight
[05:02:38] <MootPoot> dont wannt
[05:02:44] <MootPoot> emmeka:  you're a tree person
[05:02:49] <MootPoot> you know how to live in the trees
[05:02:56] <ButterNoodle> merino wool
[05:02:58] <ButterNoodle> then
[05:03:09] <emmeka> if you were living in the trees, you wouldn't need to worry about getting wet on the ground
[05:03:29] <ButterNoodle> and 35L is not very big for 3 days
[05:04:20] <MootPoot> I'll be getting water through a filter thing and my my food is seal dry packed - and 35L but my tent is externally mounted
[05:04:34] <ButterNoodle> ahh
[05:04:36] <ButterNoodle> still tho
[05:04:40] <ButterNoodle> why have a tent
[05:04:52] <ButterNoodle> and not a good bag and pad
[05:05:19] <MootPoot> so 35L for just food, water bladder, phone and shit, maybe an extra shirt but thats it
[05:05:28] <MootPoot> I already have a backpacking smol tent
[05:05:37] <MootPoot> no okane for good bag 
[05:05:42] <MootPoot> I do have a pad as well though
[05:05:43] <emmeka> MootPoot I don't think I can help you with your question, because I'm never out in the bush without a vehicle or canoe
[05:05:56] <MootPoot> overnight canoe camping?
[05:07:21] <emmeka> well I don't really camp for the hell of it, if I'm out there I am doing it for a reason... usually harvesting chaga
[05:07:30] <MootPoot> my pad is pretty heavy I guess as it is
[05:07:57] <MootPoot> so I was thinking just tent+pad+blanket
[05:08:10] <MootPoot> for about 18-24C temps
[05:09:47] <theholyduck> @MootPoot: sleeping bags you generally just strap to the underside of your backpack
[05:09:58] <MootPoot> that's where my tent is 
[05:10:07] <MootPoot> well, I guess I can put the tent inside my pack
[05:10:18] <theholyduck> Tent you usually strap up to
[05:10:20] <theholyduck> P
[05:10:34] <MootPoot> my giant ass sleeping bag is like
[05:10:42] <theholyduck> You want the heavier stuff closer to your body
[05:10:53] <MootPoot> the size of a slightly compressed water cooler container
[05:11:10] <theholyduck> Which for the tent means strapping it ontopb of your backpack
[05:11:20] <theholyduck> Behind your head
[05:11:28] <MootPoot> hmm
[05:11:32] <MootPoot> idk if theres a place to do that

[05:13:38] <theholyduck> The bottom strap thing is for things that weigh nothing
[05:13:52] <theholyduck> You will fuck your back up if you carry something heavy there
[05:14:00] <MootPoot> how much is "nothing"
[05:14:06] <MootPoot> my tent is like 1.5kg
[05:14:10] <MootPoot> I think
[05:14:35] <ButterNoodle> 1 person?
[05:14:39] <MootPoot> mmm
[05:14:47] <MootPoot> I'm going with other people
[05:14:54] <theholyduck> Lol. That doesn't sound like much of a tent to sleep in if it gets wet or windy
[05:14:54] <MootPoot> but my equipment is only for myself
[05:14:56] <ButterNoodle> the tent size
[05:15:05] <MootPoot> yeah
[05:15:18] <theholyduck> Even for a 1 person that sounds light to me. 
[05:15:19] <MootPoot> theholyduck:  I tried out this tent in the rain at 15C a few weeks ago for a night
[05:15:25] <MootPoot> works great
[05:15:26] <ButterNoodle> theholyduck: naa they come lighter
[05:15:27] <MootPoot> no problemo
[05:15:40] <ButterNoodle> thats actually a heavy 1p imho
[05:16:02] <theholyduck> Anyways. Bottom is usually where the sleeping bag goes
[05:16:14] <MootPoot> its like 1.5KG with the added floor mat, and extra set of spike thingies that go in the ground
[05:16:17] <theholyduck> It's bulky but Locke
[05:16:24] <theholyduck> Er light
[05:16:51] <theholyduck> MootPoot: so yeah I suggest putting the tent between the top opening thing
[05:16:55] <theholyduck> And the main bag
[05:17:10] <MootPoot> then what do I put down there in the loops then
[05:17:12] <MootPoot> a mat?
[05:17:19] <theholyduck> Mat or bag
[05:17:32] <theholyduck> Lightest thing you can
[05:17:48] <theholyduck> Heavier stuff needs to be close to your body
[05:17:50] <theholyduck> Or high up

[05:19:20] <theholyduck> I carried a 90s 4 person tent
[05:19:20] <MootPoot> I mean, is 500 grams that big of a deal?

[05:19:38] <theholyduck> I mean in part it's the bulk. Of it
[05:19:53] <MootPoot> I guess 500 grams is like 4-5 dehydrated meals
[05:22:43] <theholyduck> MootPoot: the way I did it was bag in bottom compartment. It's what it's for. The sleeping mat strapped to the bottom
[05:22:54] <theholyduck> And tent over shoulders 
[05:23:01] <theholyduck> But i carried a big heavy tent
[05:23:37] <theholyduck> MootPoot: I suggest looking at some backpacking images
[05:23:47] <theholyduck> Nobody puts anything heavy in those loops

[11:06:03] <Matt|home> it's benign, just non-cancerous hpv. got it from the first person i ever had sex with, and occasionally it comes back. there's permanent treatment technically but it's like $2k USD for a few mg of some immune boosting paste

[16:10:29] <Macer> so he's like king midas except he kills people

[16:12:29] <trainforest> that sounds awful

[16:13:29] <Macer> pretty much just 25 minutes of sexual frustration for however many episodes

[16:21:14] <S_T_A_N> Macer, that's a strange way to spell School Live
[16:21:17] <Macer> fair enough
[16:21:22] <theholyduck> its not like i can remember the name of any of the characters
[16:21:31] <theholyduck> and the lead kun is aptly described as robo rambo casanova jessu
[16:21:33] <Macer> yah they are just sort of there aren't they?
[16:21:38] <Macer> like those in the way characters 
[16:21:52] <theholyduck> i mean even the lead guy is mostly just there to be the best at EVERYTHING
[16:21:57] <Macer> theholyduck: his sister is super hot tho
[16:22:01] <theholyduck> despite having the worst 1 specific thing that apparently doesnt matter
[16:22:07] <Macer> yeah haha
[16:22:08] <theholyduck> his sister also clearly wants to fuck him
[16:22:34] <theholyduck> anyways that show is so stupid. i cant belive id had a sequel (which i havent watched
[16:22:34] <Macer> yeah well.. there are plenty of anime where the sister seems to have a bit too much brorom 
[16:22:50] <Macer> i liked the action parts. but they needed more of them
[16:23:12] <Macer> theholyduck: the sad fact of the matter is that there will never be another kara no kyoukai :( 
[16:23:22] <Macer> aka: the best anime ever produced
[16:23:55] <Macer> but yah. i don't see anything worth looking at now. i can just wait for this entire season to end and just grind through it all

[17:03:06] <Cryowolf> snake, I'm male, not a cute girl and I have no interest in other males (not even traps.) However, if you're a sentient pillow I may reconsider the situation
[17:03:53] <snake> boring!
[17:05:50] <snake> Cryowolf, i like to use these sorts of labels, which, imo are pretty unambiguous
[17:06:01] <snake> male boy, male girl, female girl, female boy
[17:06:21] <snake> Cryowolf, but there are intersexes which i have not come up with labels for since it might be rude
[17:06:40] <snake> plus they tend to be quite rare
[17:06:45] <Cryowolf> what are you talking about? If youre worried I'm gonna be offended, don't be
[17:07:05] <Cryowolf> if you wanna have an innie and an outie at the same time, that's fine. You can be a Kitami
[17:07:06] <snake> im not worried about you just in general want to be sensitive while also coming up with functional labels
[17:07:36] <snake> Cryowolf, the first part of the labels is the sex, then the gender follows
[17:07:52] <snake> gender is a social construct, an idea, and you can subscribe to one if you want but it's actually optional
[17:08:00] <Cryowolf> .............
[17:08:06] <snake> but sex is unchanging, at least from a chromosomal standpoint
[17:08:15] <Cryowolf> I'll let myself out cause I can't stand this topic
[17:08:56] <snake> Cryowolf, i have not thought of any label for a person who has undergone SCS, but it seems like a more private affair anyways, so the labels above apply

[17:10:47] <snake> you were responding to my quote which was me saying i could date a cute girl even if she has a penis
[17:11:02] <snake> idk why you are so upset tbh
[17:11:36] <snake> there is also the non-binary gender i suppose
[17:11:52] <snake> oh and the attack helicopter isms lol
[17:12:06] <Cryowolf> I must've taken a wrong turn, I thought I was in anime, not gender studies :P
[17:12:07] <snake> makes no sense but hey, whatevs, it's just an imaginary thing so
[17:12:36] <snake> Cryowolf, we have quite a number of male girls in this channel
[17:12:42] <snake> like at least 2-3 i think
[17:13:17] <Cryowolf> I don't care, that's their personal business and not any of mine in how they choose to live their life
[17:14:01] <snake> right but there is a debate in the world, and i feel it's good to be armed with knowledge and terminology

[17:16:12] <snake> im not even debating, just discussing the topic
[17:16:23] <Cryowolf> Im not, I dont even want to and I dont know why Im doing it

[17:17:09] <snake> lol
[17:17:18] <snake> its all good SOS
[17:17:26] <SpiritOfSummer> yeah I know
[17:17:34] <SpiritOfSummer> I wish arguments from this other channel I'm in were that tame
[17:18:35] <snake> one thing i'm unsure of is people who do sex-change operations, are they male or female?
[17:18:45] <snake> their chromosomes say one thing, and their surgery says another
[17:18:46] <S_T_A_N> in case we needed more evidence of the.... poor quality of that person lol
[17:19:11] <snake> i think they could be both perhaps
[17:19:43] <SpiritOfSummer> what's a hermaphrodite again
[17:20:01] <snake> idk, im pretty sure that is a term used for animals who undergo a natural sex-change
[17:20:04] <snake> right?
[17:20:12] <snake> like there are frogs that actually do this
[17:20:19] <SpiritOfSummer> I think it's what you said
[17:20:23] <S_T_A_N> I was under the impression it was someone born with both
[17:20:26] <Cryowolf> SpiritOfSummer, having both genitals but it doesn't necesserily mean either has full anatomical function
[17:21:10] <SpiritOfSummer> snake: yeah actually 
[17:21:21] <SpiritOfSummer> there's stuff like that going on with frogs as a result of pharmaceutical runoff
[17:21:26] <Cryowolf> one of them will usually be functional though, while the other is "cosmetic"
[17:21:29] <SpiritOfSummer> the chemical is called Atrozene, that's a study out of berkley
[17:21:35] <Cryowolf> they're turning the frogs gay
[17:21:42] <SpiritOfSummer> come on Cryowolf
[17:21:47] <SpiritOfSummer> don't just grab the low hanging fruit in life
[17:21:54] <Cryowolf> You gotta love him tho
[17:21:58] <SpiritOfSummer> Cryowolf: dude
[17:21:59] <Cryowolf> Alex Jones is so quoteable
[17:22:01] <SpiritOfSummer> yes
[17:22:16] <snake> SpiritOfSummer, i dont think its from pharmacuetical runoff, they actually do it naturally

[17:22:30] <SpiritOfSummer> snake: the science of it is beyond me
[17:22:45] <SpiritOfSummer> but in my understanding Berkley studies are the real deal 
[17:23:18] <snake> yes, maybe there is pharmacuetical runoff triggering it, but it can also be triggered by a lack of male/females
[17:23:34] <snake> but again idk, i never heard of that, i was only aware of it happening naturally
[17:23:36] <SpiritOfSummer> Cryowolf: the reason I said that is because most people dismiss extreme amounts of deep information that could really help the world just because of who it came from 
[17:23:50] <SpiritOfSummer> "epstein didn't kill himself" was the biggest one of all time
[17:24:11] <snake> oh damn i attracted a crazy person

[17:31:04] <snake> (btw the fbi investigated and found epstein did indeed kill himself)

[18:29:28] <SpiritOfSummer> treeman5: fate/zero is awesome
[18:30:08] <treeman5> yeh im half an episode in its pretty interesting
[18:30:27] <SpiritOfSummer> treeman5: did you watch Stay Night first
[18:30:54] <SpiritOfSummer> I watched the original stay night so I didn't miss any themes as a result of Zero being a prequel
[18:31:18] <SpiritOfSummer> and then after Zero, I watched Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works to continue the story, which turned out to be an awesome way to watch the show
[18:31:19] *** Joins: Abrax (~Abrax@user/abrax)
[18:31:31] <SpiritOfSummer> The original stay night was good but UBW took the cake. 
[18:31:46] <treeman5> no i heard that you can start with zero
[18:31:52] <SpiritOfSummer> yeah you 100% can
[18:32:05] <treeman5> its rated higher too
[18:32:11] <SpiritOfSummer> yeah it's my favorite one
[18:32:53] <SpiritOfSummer> treeman5: I recommend watching the Unlimited Blade Works version of Stay Night 
[18:33:10] <SpiritOfSummer> it's a better continuation of Zero's story, and it continues the high budget animation quality
[18:33:18] <treeman5> alright

[18:36:34] <beaky> !a animewar
[18:36:35] <ImoutoBot> beaky: I don't recognize that anime.
[18:36:44] <SpiritOfSummer> it's fan made
[18:36:50] <SpiritOfSummer> Mainly Dragon Ball themed
[18:37:05] <beaky> nice i like dragon ball
[18:37:09] <SpiritOfSummer> involved characters from Naruto, Bleach, Fairy Tail, One Punch Man
[18:37:17] <SpiritOfSummer> beaky: Anime war is incredible.
[18:37:33] <SpiritOfSummer> it obviously has budget shortcomings in comparison to studios like funimation
[18:37:50] <SpiritOfSummer> but as a result of being fan made, the show reaches much further in certain aspects and has a way of showing you exactly what a viewer would want to see
[18:39:54] <ButterNoodle> I had dragon balls til I emptied them
[18:40:48] <SpiritOfSummer> ButterNoodle: do you know A24
[18:41:09] <SpiritOfSummer> there was this plumber in the movie I watched last night called "In Fabric" that you kind of reminded me of

[19:21:17] <Cryowolf>  That quoted question is pretty interesting actually cause no it doesn't. Whether or not you plan to commit rape however and what that fantasy is born from, determines if it comes from a healthy or unhealthy place

[19:23:09] <ButterNoodle> *thot control
[19:23:24] <Sadale> lol
[19:23:33] <Cryowolf> Sadale, there's also simple fantasy about domination, or being dominated
[19:23:41] <Cryowolf> and in the confines of a fantasy, nobody is harmed
[19:23:58] <Sadale> yep :3
[19:24:04] <ButterNoodle> bring back kowloon and I'll be there
[19:24:06] <Cryowolf> most people don't want to harm others
[19:24:07] <Sadale> Just FYI I'm a sub xD
[19:24:18] * ButterNoodle doms Sadale 
[19:24:25] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, Kowloon's still around. But the walled city's gone
[19:24:33] <Sadale> In fact I'm inside Kowloon right now
[19:24:46] <Cryowolf> I can be dominating but I'm not highly aggressive, abit of a sloth
[19:24:54] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, nope. You ain't female. :P
[19:24:58] <ButterNoodle> yea thats the Kowloon that I wanna see.. its a park now, and all peaceful
[19:25:13] <ButterNoodle> Sadale: we are talking about fantasizing
[19:25:23] <ButterNoodle> just pretend the beard isnt there
[19:25:25] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, lol a year back you could see all those riots going on here, including inside Kowloon. :P
[19:25:27] <ButterNoodle> :3
[19:25:37] <Cryowolf> when Kowloon was just a stacked city waiting to fall apart, that's when it was a truly lawless place
[19:25:41] <Sadale> hmm actually not a year back. But a couple of years back
[19:26:04] <ButterNoodle> yep
[19:26:05] <Cryowolf> if you wanted to move in, just start building somewhere and hope it doesnt collapse and kill you
[19:26:16] <Sadale> I like peace more than chaos tho. It's all about profit to me. Peace means profit. Chaos means loss :3
[19:26:39] <ButterNoodle> they both mean profit tbh.. depends on whant kinda salesman you are
[19:26:55] <Cryowolf> nah, constant chaos means loss but being opportunistic about chaos can be very profitable
[19:27:08] <Sadale> Nah I'm not a salesman. I'm just a law-abiding citizen. :3
[19:27:33] <Sadale> peace means economy. chaos means economy decline
[19:27:33] <Cryowolf> you usually make a killing on other peoples losses and suffering if you exploit a chaotic situation though
[19:27:43] <Cryowolf> it's not that simple Sadale
[19:28:01] <Sadale> true. I've heard that some people sold props to rioters back then.
[19:28:05] <Cryowolf> unless youre using the wrong word
[19:28:35] <Cryowolf> chaos can create opportunity where there was none before, allowing for profit or power grabs
[19:28:35] <Sadale> I'm just talking about to me tho. YMMV.
[19:28:56] <Cryowolf> after that you can stabilize things
[19:29:06] <Cryowolf> or move them, or change them
[19:29:17] <Cryowolf> operate with the flow and predict which side the wind is gonna turn
[19:29:19] <Sadale> I have a feeling that the chaos you're talking about isn't the same as the one that I'm talking about.
[19:29:43] <Cryowolf> chaos is a state of existence, not an event

[19:32:33] <Sadale> aww I wish I could speak Japanese
[19:33:06] <Cryowolf> During extremely chaotic situations there's a reason why stock exchanges close
[19:33:21] <Cryowolf> cause opportunists gonna be opportunists
[19:33:25] <Cryowolf> obviously
[19:36:06] <Cryowolf> I would be an opportunity on the stock market if I had the money to do so
[19:36:06] <Cryowolf> opportunist*
[19:36:06] <Cryowolf> then I would try and understand how it works and engages, try to predict the outcome and so on....and once I'm rich I will pay a genius company for an algorhithm that predicts changes in the stock exchange
[19:36:06] <Cryowolf> then I tweet something stupid and cause a shift in the stock market cause I'm a billionaire and my tweets will obviously impact my companies and the world
[19:36:06] <Cryowolf> and use that chaos as an opportunity to do something on the side, which then stabilizes and makes me a profit
