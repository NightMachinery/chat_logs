[16:44:59] <japh> altreus, do you have a working setup in vim for going to a module with gf? It works for me on things like: use Foo::Bar::Baz, but not on things like Foo::Bar::Baz::skoskav() where it thinks that skoskav is a Bar/skoskav.pm .
[16:47:54] <LeoNerd> I wrote myself a tiny script ages ago called `perlmodpath`, which I use in vim like   :view `perlmodpath Foo::Bar::Baz`  in that case
[16:48:04] <LeoNerd> It's also handy on shell generally
[16:49:11] <stanrifkin_> japh: can't replicate. works for me
[16:49:16] <japh> well, gf works out of the box in vim if you set 'path' correctly. Except on function calls like above
[16:49:39] <stanrifkin_> Foo::Bar->func()
[16:49:46] <stanrifkin_> instead of ::
[16:51:17] <japh> neither works for me
[16:51:28] <stanrifkin_> i don't know vim enought to improve this?
[16:51:35] <stanrifkin_> not? tried it know
[16:51:46] <stanrifkin_> i changed :: to -> then it worked

[19:34:39] <Altreus> keep typing qw// instead of qr// and argh
[19:34:43] <Altreus> frustrating
[19:38:09] <pragma-> Hm. You can write soemthing like `my $data = func(...) // 'some default value if not defined by func()';` instead of `my $data = func(...); $data = 'default value' if not defined $data;` -- but you can't write `my $data = func(...) && return $data;` to return it if it's defined? Instead you have to write `my $data = func(...); return $data if defined $data;` :( Or am I missing something?
[19:39:12] <Altreus> Probably because you return the variable that's just been my'd

[19:39:22] <Altreus> you can probably do my $data; $data = func(...) && return $data
[19:39:54] <Altreus> you could also do if (my $data = func) { return $data }, but you can't do return $data if my $data = func; - for the same reason
[19:40:08] <pragma-> :(
[19:40:16] <Altreus> you could use $_ for it :P
[19:40:30] <revhippie> return func(...) // do { ... } ?
[19:40:33] <Altreus> but no - it's not a thing that's shortcutted in perl (but it is in raku)
[19:40:47] <Altreus> I bet you could write a returnwith keyword though
[19:43:32] <Grinnz> also, && tests truth not defined
[19:43:38] <pragma-> That is true.

[19:53:31] <xenu> weird, windows for some reason doesn't like that character
[19:54:04] <xenu> it renders correcly in firefox, but notepad displays it a square and my terminal as "?"
[19:54:51] <xenu> it's like fallbacking is broken for that single specific character
[19:55:01] <pragma-> Yeah, Firefox probably is doing font-collapsing or whatever they call it where it searches other system fonts to find a fallback font that contains the character, but notepad and the terminal don't.
[19:55:44] <Adura> It's a bit wacky
[19:56:24] <pragma-> You can get a newer version of notepad from the Windows Store but IIRC they've now locked it to Windows 11 downloads only.

[19:59:59] <pragma-> Yeah, Microsoft had been moving most of the system utils out of the Windows installer/Windows Update thing and into the Microsoft Store instead. So to update system apps, you go through the Windows Store instead of Windows Updates. Now some apps are being updated only in the Windows 11 repositories.
[20:00:48] <pragma-> Fat chance of my PC getting a TPM module so Windows 11 is out of reach for me.
[20:00:54] <El_Che> apple fcked us all with their app store model

[20:01:27] <pragma-> Though apparently there's a way to make Windows 11 ignore the TPM check, I hear.
[20:02:43] <xenu> although i believe that manual install (as opposed to windows update) ignores the official requirements
[20:03:11] <El_Che> isn't the idea with Windows to always skip one versie?
[20:03:44] <pragma-> The idea with Windows is to stay with your favorite version as long as you desperately can.
[20:03:59] <pragma-> Some people are still in WinXP!
