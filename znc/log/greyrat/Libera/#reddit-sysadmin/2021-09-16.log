[02:00:42] <shibboleth> yeah, yeah, git it. but it still has no bearing on just how wrong/much of a jumble int0x1C8 boss statement is
[02:00:43] <int0x1C8> he's saying that means the switch isn't configured correctly and the network won't work

[02:01:25] <int0x1C8> 253 is our firewall by the way
[02:01:41] <shibboleth> still, he could be right given this: if the switch is pulling its config from somewhere else
[02:02:23] <int0x1C8> he's saying the fact it can't traceroute means it can't find the route to the destination, but it can ping so obviously it can
[02:03:25] <int0x1C8> he's asserting that if ping works traceroute should always work too
[02:03:43] <shibboleth> no, that's the opposite of what you just said that he said?

[02:05:25] <shibboleth> <int0x1C8> he's asserting that if ping works traceroute should always work too

[02:15:33] <int0x1C8> CableNinja, how does one configure it to traceroute on the same subnet then?

[02:16:15] <CableNinja> ...why
[02:16:17] <shibboleth> that's not how traceroute works though? it sends icmp with increasing ttl?

[02:18:55] <CableNinja> int0x1C8,  shibboleth, anyway... on same subnet, with a proper config, traceroute works, even on same subnet
[02:19:09] <CableNinja> it will return a single hop
[02:19:23] <shibboleth> which isn't the "route"
[02:19:32] <CableNinja> of course not
[02:19:36] <CableNinja> well, it is,
[02:19:37] <shibboleth> just that the arbitrary ttl that traceroute set expired

[02:19:47] <shibboleth> at that hop
[02:19:52] <CableNinja> ...
[02:19:55] <shibboleth> which in this case happens to be the actual dest
[02:20:02] <CableNinja> it would respond with an error if it wasnt proper
[02:20:37] <CableNinja> on the same subnet, the default gateway is not used

[09:42:33] <Work-BWMerlin> I cannot find it so I cannot update the profile
[09:42:42] <xe0n> a profile on what?
[09:42:44] <xe0n> you're not making sense
[09:42:46] <xe0n> context missing...
[09:42:47] <Work-BWMerlin> Users are standard users on their device so I don't think they can trust a cert
[09:42:54] <xe0n> yes they can, the machine trusts it
[09:42:56] <Work-BWMerlin> MDM profile
[09:43:05] <xe0n> you shouldnt be prompted to trust a cert, if you are, it means the chain is incomplete
[09:43:15] <xe0n> if i deploy a cert, i dont wany any user interaction...
[09:43:38] <Work-BWMerlin> Yes, which is why the MDM profile pushes the cert down onto the users device so they don't get prompted to accept it
[09:43:44] <xe0n> excellent
[09:43:59] <xe0n> so the issue is due to expire? cool, go into the mdm config and see how it's been setup\apply a new cert?
[09:44:12] <Work-BWMerlin> That cert is going to expire in about a month, a new cert has been made but I am trying to figure out where I can get my hands onit
[09:44:32] <xe0n> nice, well its probably stored where ever you push it from?
[09:44:32] <xe0n> lol
[09:44:52] <Work-BWMerlin> The wireless cert that is used in the MDM profile is uploaded
[09:45:11] <Work-BWMerlin> So trying to find out where the person who made the wireless MDM profiles got it from
[09:46:07] <xe0n> nice :)
[09:46:11] <xe0n> that'd be a starting point haha
[09:46:42] <Work-BWMerlin> Unfortunately like most things in BCE it is a "head office" thing
[09:46:57] <Work-BWMerlin> So while I have to make the profile and support it I can't get access to a lot of stuff
[09:47:18] <Work-BWMerlin> Also support is "ask a third part company"
[09:48:02] <Work-BWMerlin> They tie your hands up and then tell you to ask someone else to do the work you cannot do because they tied your hands
[09:51:34] <xe0n> hahaha
[09:51:43] <xe0n> well when it breaks, call head office :P
[09:55:59] <Work-BWMerlin> The "unhelpful" desk lives up to it's name
[09:56:19] <Work-BWMerlin> It was nice when I had all the control
[09:56:30] <Work-BWMerlin> Just go in and get the information I needed or make the change etc
[09:57:12] <Work-BWMerlin> Now there is a lot more leg work trying to figure out why things don't work only to realise that you don't have access to figure that part out
[09:58:43] <xe0n> change management...

[16:48:41] <rpifan> crustacean, si quisiera pasar un mes en algun lugar abrigado y barato en espana en diciembre, donde me recomiendas
[16:48:54] <crustacean> If someone comes to Spain north I would tour for hum
[16:48:56] <rpifan> teh_f4ll3n, i forget your story, you are russian - american i think?
[16:49:06] <crustacean> rpifan: Do you mean cozy and cheap?
[16:49:09] <teh_f4ll3n> 100% russian
[16:49:19] <rpifan> teh_f4ll3n, putin khulot
[16:49:20] <teh_f4ll3n> with an Estonian citizenship
[16:49:26] <rpifan> so you are a soviet
[16:49:32] <sintax> first real russian i ever met was an angry sys admin in the US
[16:49:34] <teh_f4ll3n> a dirty commie
[16:49:42] <rpifan> teh_f4ll3n, my roommae is also a former soviet
[16:49:50] <sintax> he was a neat guy
[16:49:51] <teh_f4ll3n> I'm an angry sysadmin in Ireland
[16:49:59] <sintax> at least there's booze!
[16:50:00] <rpifan> but he is from lithuania i think, i meet his grandmother and mom and they are all russian speakers
[16:50:10] <rpifan> teh_f4ll3n, so you escaped the soviet union for ireland?
[16:50:13] <crustacean> rpifan: Probably north of spain, for that awesome rain or something like Granada
[16:50:26] <rpifan> not cozy i mean warm, hot, humid
[16:50:45] <teh_f4ll3n> No, I left Estonia over 20 years after the USSR collapsed
[16:51:05] <crustacean> In December you wont find warm hot and humid here
[16:51:08] <rpifan> i hear estonia is very advanced with E stuff
[16:51:15] <rpifan> crustacean, malaga was hot last year in january
[16:51:19] <crustacean> Maybe in something like Sevilla
[16:51:22] <teh_f4ll3n> much more that the US, yes, rpifan 
[16:51:28] <rpifan> im in D-Land
[16:51:33] <rpifan> worst european country ever

[16:54:09] <crustacean> teh_f4ll3n: Sweet summer child

[16:58:57] <crustacean> It helps having a lab
[16:59:00] <rpifan> why there was only one copy, well that was a bigger mess that i coldnt control to begin wih
[16:59:01] <nobyk> it was like an entire storage controller, we yanked the wrong power cord lmao
[16:59:16] <rpifan> lool nobyk 
[16:59:17] <nobyk> and as if that wasn't bad enough, that thing was so old and rusty, it killed the raid controller
[16:59:19] <rpifan> label your chords

[16:59:24] <teh_f4ll3n> Asturias... Is that where Astorga is?
[16:59:26] <nobyk> so it wouldn't even power on all the way anymore
[16:59:27] <nobyk> loool
[16:59:32] <nobyk> haha that sucked ass
[16:59:55] <rpifan> i liked malaga a lot, valencia is trash
[16:59:57] <nobyk> Yeah it's funny afterwards but not when you've just done it
[17:00:00] <rpifan> im not going back to valencia
[17:00:07] <crustacean> teh_f4ll3n: Astorga is Leon
[17:00:12] <rpifan> of course, i could just imagine my heart jumping out
[17:00:23] <crustacean> Which is South from Asturias
[17:00:42] <crustacean> Like 300Km?
[17:00:44] <crustacean> More or less
[17:00:56] <teh_f4ll3n> I did the Camino in 2010, so I can't remember shit
[17:01:06] <crustacean> nobyk: Killing shit its so much fun
[17:01:22] <rpifan> the camino seems like a bad idea
[17:01:30] <teh_f4ll3n> it's ok
[17:01:31] <rpifan> unless you wanan lose an extreme amount of weight
[17:01:48] <teh_f4ll3n> you just switch off and walk

[17:04:19] <teh_f4ll3n> @scruple, ^^ depends on your use case. you can go with 1, 5, 6, or 10...
[17:04:50] <sd> 05<s‚Äãcruple> I see
[17:04:59] <teh_f4ll3n> all depends on what you have to work with and what you want to achieve
[17:05:02] <rpifan> yea if you got the drives why not
[17:05:14] <Oliber> how important is your data, what performance do you need, what controllers do you have, how many drives do you currently have and how many can you connect
[17:05:16] <nobyk> Why not learn about all the types of raid
[17:05:29] <teh_f4ll3n> I suggest reading up in the RAID setups

[21:34:11] <catbeard> programatically crawls a site via the sitemap.xml linkages, and sub-sitemaps, then visits those pages and looks for links not in the sitemap, crawls all pages (once) looking for forms and form inputs of a specific type, and unique form action handlers

[21:39:09] <catbeard> the end goal here is to identify pages which have form inputs or links with integer or string arguments to pass to sqlmap
[21:39:45] <thegodsquirrel> That's cool.  sqlmap is a neat tool.
[21:40:41] <catbeard> yeah but you have to pass very specific arguments, and instead of spray and pray, you can just pass a list of vulnerable endpoints and try all detected ones
[21:41:04] <catbeard> shaves down the webappsec scanning time 100 fold
[21:41:40] <catbeard> ideally i could just launch sqlmap as a subprocess and grep out the vulnerable param and injection string

[21:44:42] <catbeard> works on regular sitemaps, master sitemaps (ones that have multiple sitemaps stemming from /sitemap.xml)
[21:45:05] <catbeard> and it adds a hrefs (unique ones) that are linked to from every page to add to the discovery phase
[21:45:30] <catbeard> so it catches pages that aren't in the sitemap but are linked to by pages in the sitemap
[21:46:13] <thegodsquirrel> are you pumping that into something like maltego?
[21:46:16] <iphone> too smart for this channel
