[00:36:15] <prussian> companion_cube: cool... cool... I'll look into it. Haskell seems a bit weird for many uses.
[00:36:30] <prussian> So anything that's functional has to be good enough
[00:36:55] <companion_cube> if  you want a FP language that compiles to native code you don't have a lot of options anyway :s
[00:38:14] <klardotsh> not to native code but I"ve been playing with the idea of a minimalish mostly-FP language that compiles to Lua, which could probably be made aaaaaalmost fast enough (via LuaJIT) to not care
[00:38:54] <mouseghost> ocaml!
[00:38:59] <mouseghost> oh wait it does not compile to lua
[00:39:03] <companion_cube> I recently saw a SML to lua compiler
[00:39:05] <klardotsh> I have no idea if that idea will ever see the real light of day, but I have some inkling to make a thing that gives me ML-ish syntax, strong types, option/result types, and not a whole heck of a lot else, for the times when I don't need Rust
[00:39:08] <companion_cube> (not finished)
[00:39:21] <companion_cube> klardotsh: yeah that sounds quite cool
[00:39:28] <companion_cube> only issue is that the set of base types kind of sucks
[00:39:50] <mouseghost> klardotsh, are you going to make it in rust? that'd be quite funny :D isnt rust bootstrapped in ocaml or haskell or something?
[00:39:51] <companion_cube> (no bigints, for example, but you can add them)
[00:39:56] <companion_cube> nah rust is in rust now
[00:40:02] <companion_cube> it started in OCaml but that's a long time ago
[00:40:05] <klardotsh> mouseghost: ocaml gets into enough weird academic shit I can't understand (and still has a limited "do two things at once through basically any mechanism" story last I checked) that I didn't really invest too much time into learning it
[00:40:10] <mouseghost> yeah, but it was in something else long time ago
[00:40:25] <klardotsh> mouseghost: nah, bootstrap would be in lua. I have a few dozen lines of the prelude library going, we'll see if I actually implement the compiler at some point
[00:40:41] <mouseghost> klardotsh, explain "do two things..."?

[00:41:18] <klardotsh> parallelism and/or concurrency. both stories seemed.... awkward (multicore ocaml is/was still a fork, and async I vaguely recall had multiple implementations or something?)
[00:41:41] <mouseghost> ah yeah, two predominant choices exist
[00:41:41] <klardotsh> my memory is fuzzy though. it's been a year or two since I tried looking into it.
[00:41:48] <mouseghost> one from jane street, one from i dont know who

[05:19:33] <dimadima> companion_cube: what about it?
[05:21:13] <companion_cube> like good blogposts on how to do it efficiently, how to represent stuff, perhaps viewers…
[05:24:19] <dimadima> any particular language/ecosystem? structured/hierarchical logging is something that's always troubled me as well
[05:24:53] <companion_cube> OCaml
[05:25:00] <companion_cube> so there's nothing, afaict
[05:25:09] <companion_cube> also I need sth for debugging, not for network services
[05:27:10] <dimadima> probably everyone does it some arbitrary way they come up with?
[05:27:26] <companion_cube> no idea :/
[05:31:07] <dimadima> so i'll post with the caveat that i know it's crap
[05:31:19] <dimadima> but basically the only thing i've never read about structured logging is this: https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan/blob/master/README.md?plain=1#L16
[05:31:20] <buttsbot> node-bunyan/README.md at master · trentm/node-bunyan · GitHub
[05:32:25] <dimadima> when you look at GKE logs, they're all structured but in no particular format, just a bunch of JSON
[05:32:40] <dimadima> it seems like people just dump json into structured logs :(
[05:32:51] <dimadima> i've never enjoyed that myself
[05:34:00] <dimadima> structured logs are hard to directly grep, you need to process w/ tools like jq first (if you're using JSON)
[05:34:05] <dimadima> but flat logs suck too
[05:40:06] <klardotsh> companion_cube: since I alluded to this earlier and you thought the idea was neat. very very very WIP and no promise I'll ever finish this, but here's where my thinking is so far https://gist.github.com/klardotsh/414e0698de3e4c82fb814530e5b7d756

[05:51:07] <companion_cube> yeah I should say _hierarchical logs_
[05:52:03] <companion_cube> like, I need to debug stuff, I do printf logging
[05:52:13] <companion_cube> but it's not always cutting it for super complex stuff
[06:10:45] <dimadima> ah. welp, in java there's the convention of instantiating a logger for each class and using that logger within that class; and that logger's logs are prefixed with the name of the class
[06:11:03] <dimadima> and whatever else you configure, like the time etc
[06:11:49] <dimadima> not sure if that's what you mean, and if so, what an equivalent thing would be in ocaml. i'd guess in general any popular logging framework for ocaml would come w/ conventions?
[06:11:58] <companion_cube> sure
[06:12:03] <dimadima> that seems to be the thing from language to language
[06:12:07] <companion_cube> I'm not expressing myself right I think :
[06:12:10] <companion_cube> :/
[06:12:12] <dimadima> yeah i'm srory
[06:12:17] <companion_cube> hierarchical means each message can be in a stack
[06:12:22] <companion_cube> like, be a child of another message
[06:12:29] <companion_cube> so you can fold/unfold if you want more details
[06:12:36] <dimadima> hmm interesting
[06:12:38] <companion_cube> cause this only works when I log like fucking crazy
[06:12:45] <companion_cube> a bit like stack traces, m'kay? :D
[06:12:47] <dimadima> that is cool
[06:12:49] <companion_cube> but serialized
[06:12:52] <dimadima> i don't think i've ever seen that!
[06:12:56] <companion_cube> hmm
[06:13:01] <dimadima> does that imply that the logs are stateful?
[06:13:17] <dimadima> the logging, i mean
[06:13:32] <dimadima> like, if you want to have one log be the child of another log, then you need to somehow reference the parent when do log the child?
[06:13:51] <dimadima> or is there some way to set that up a-priori
[06:13:57] <dimadima> which would make more sense
[06:14:15] <companion_cube> my idea right now is that the parent has a begin/end
[06:14:19] <companion_cube> ie it's two parts
[06:14:28] <companion_cube> (ofc subtleties with threads)
[06:14:53] <companion_cube> and I stream events like "msg begin", "msg end", "msg" (for non-hierarchical stuff) onto disk…
[06:15:45] <dimadima> ah
[06:15:52] <dimadima> something as simple as that
[06:16:54] <dimadima> streaming to disk makes sense because my next question was: how do you then "collapse"/"expand" the parent if it's logging to the console :)
[06:17:47] <dimadima> depending on your program, each `msg` may need an ID if invocations may be simultaenous
[06:18:07] <dimadima> anyway, i'm zonked out. good luck figuring out something simple that works :)

[18:54:53] <pja> My youngest is adamant that he /needs/ the Pokemon games as well, despite the last one being terrible.
[18:55:38] <pja> Lots of decent indie games on the switch too. As well as an /awful/ lot of trash. Nintendo doesn’t bother curating the store at all.
[18:56:07] <pja> Plus some v.expensive, v.cutdown AAA games. The Witcher III? Yup. Frame rate must be awful I assume.
[18:56:27] <riv> haha

[19:01:23] <companion_cube> on the go means in the baby playpen :D
[19:01:57] <riv> in C we do it with tcsetattr, not sure in ruby
[19:02:16] <riv> what games do you like on it companion_cube ?
[19:02:28] <companion_cube> well I've followed Geekingfrog mostly :p
[19:02:36] <companion_cube> Hollow Knight, and Celeste, def.
[19:02:40] <companion_cube> also Hades a while ago
[19:02:48] <companion_cube> haven't yet bought a single nintendo game 😂
[19:03:09] <ngoldbaum> botw is the best open world game i’ve ever played
[19:03:25] <Geekingfrog> botw is definitely worth a try, can do pretty short sessions as well
[19:03:38] <ngoldbaum> mario odyssey was also quite good
[19:05:02] <riv> yeah that looks good
[19:05:14] <riv> ive been meaning to play like, sunshine and so on
[19:05:19] <riv> for a long time -- but never did it
[19:05:37] <companion_cube> does botw work ok on the small screen?
[19:05:58] <mouseghost> riv, well, its usb cdc device
[19:06:02] <mouseghost> so not quite serial serial
[19:08:21] <ngoldbaum> riv: 3d all stars was good too, bowser’s fury was great
[19:08:48] <ngoldbaum> companion_cube: yeah it works fine, the framerate can drop a bit sometimes in handheld mode is all
[19:09:15] <riv> :D
[19:11:36] <companion_cube> probably my next buy then
[19:11:43] <companion_cube> unless silk song gets released first ♥
[19:18:01] <pja> We have a bunch of multiplayer indie games on the switch.
[19:18:25] <pja> Unrailed. Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime. Towerfall. Probably some others...
[19:18:45] <pja> companion_cube: Youngest is /hyped/ for Silksong. He speedruns the original for fun.
[19:19:11] <companion_cube> oh dear
[19:19:17] <pja> I’m like, welp. I feel old now, because this isn’t my idea of fun, but it makes him happy, so...
[19:19:19] <companion_cube> problem is, no one knows when it'll release
[19:19:57] <pja> companion_cube: BotW is pretty good on the small screen imo.
[19:21:12] <companion_cube> alriiight

[19:56:54] <defect> has anyone used that nextdoor app? i'm curious but i suspect the amount of nimbyism and petty shit would be too much to not get angry att
[20:18:12] <pja> It’s notorious for racist bullshit. But maybe OK in some locales?
[20:18:26] <pja> We just have a street WhatsApp group.
[20:19:27] <pja> Which admittedly /nearly/ triggered an Israel/Palestine flamewar at one point last year. Fortunately everyone involved decided that discretion was the better part of valour before things went too far...

[20:26:09] <buttsbot> Backups and Corruption | Lobsters
[20:26:25] <gerikson> they said that a macOS security update hosed their files
[20:26:30] <gerikson> which is like ... huge
[20:29:38] <imode> dimadima: I didn't, I'm using a tileset, but the rest is me.
[20:29:47] <imode> also gooood morning.
[20:36:09] <pja> gerikson: Presumably filesystem corruption leading to writing junk all over existing files.
[20:36:26] <pja> Just need a bit flip in the wrong place...
[20:36:53] <pja> The major problem they had was having a single online backup mirror, with no history.
[20:37:03] <pja> That’s not a backup - it’s a very slow RAID1 array.
[20:37:10] <pja> & RAID is not a backup.
[20:39:43] <pja> I have not yet reached backup nirvana as I only have onsite backups.
[20:41:16] <gerikson> I have a local time machine backup and backblaze
[20:43:35] * pja examines backup server
[20:44:04] <pja> 280Gb. Enough to be annoying to backup to the cloud.
[20:49:53] <mouseghost> can i move socket reader to the end of the stream, somehow?
[20:50:21] <riv> did you make any progress with ruby not being able to read/write?
[20:50:33] <mouseghost> yep
[20:51:10] <mouseghost> it does read and write. however, the device, tinySA, sends the prompt whenever theres lack of data to read from the stream
[20:51:19] <mouseghost> im still not sure how it is that it works in minicom, but...
[20:51:25] <mouseghost> i dont know, maybe minicom sends some characters

[21:36:27] *** Quits: jess (~jess@libera/staff/jess) ()
[22:00:05] <mouseghost> riv, the thing is that leenux doesnt really work as promised by "everything a file"
[22:29:20] <mouseghost> all i had to do was to use some serial gem
[22:29:30] <mouseghost> and not try to write and read to the /dev/tty directly
[22:46:39] <pja> mouseghost: Unix abandoned “everything is a file” when it merged tcp/ip. Plan 9 is what you get if you stick to that worldview.
[23:51:03] <cb_> everything is a file fell apart with tape
