[07:28:54] <Rockwood> i am getting only this
[07:35:23] <sm> hello folks. I am working on an old home-grown access control system. At login time it checks their password, and on success saves the user's id in the session. Subsequent page views succeed if the session contains a user id and it matches a user in the db. Isn't this pretty weak ? Shouldn't it save something harder to guess in the session ? Would the password hash be a good or bad choice ?
[07:37:12] <Blondie101010> Rockwood:  that's a question for your web server support
[07:37:16] <__adrian> "harder to guess"?  who's guessing?
[07:37:33] <__adrian> but direct answer: password hash: NO, DON'T DO THAT.

[07:42:23] <sm> __adrian: thanks for your reply. I mean, if I knew how it worked, couldn't I craft a session myself, guessing a valid user id, and then be accepted by access control, bypassing the login step ?
[07:43:22] <__adrian> how exactly do you plan on putting that guessed user id into the session?
[07:44:22] <__adrian> your thinking is good, but i think you don't realize that sessions are _server side_. as a client, you don't have access to them.
[07:44:27] <sm> isn't the session just a cookie with a certain format, for a certain domain ? Couldn't I make one of those ? Or modify one copied from someone's machine, or from a previous session of my own ?
[07:44:31] <__adrian> nope
[07:44:46] <__adrian> sessions (by default) are files stored on the server.
[07:45:13] <__adrian> the session cookie is just an identifier (a reasonably-secure nonce)
[07:45:31] <__adrian> it's used by php to look up which session file to use.
[07:45:35] <sm> ah.. and the cookie is just a key. I am somewhat reassured, thank you
[07:45:40] <__adrian> np
[07:46:32] <sm> this app has its own separate session system as well. All a bit confusing.
[07:46:34] <Rockwood> cookies and session both are depends on each other
[07:47:19] <__adrian> if you mean it actually implements its own session handler, then everything i just said is qualified with "maybe probably"
[07:47:49] <__adrian> but if you just mean it has a bunch of custom session-handling junk, that's fine/not too unusual
[07:48:19] <sm> it uses standard php sessions for access control, and its own custom session system for other things (storing large data more efficiently in chunks). So I think your advice is still right

[11:46:45] *** Joins: stenno (~stenno@user/stenno)
[11:50:15] <freeman_h> AllenJB, my bad dont really need to care about if its , or .
[11:50:38] *** DuckThom is now known as aloy
[11:50:55] <freeman_h> however the issue with that is
[11:50:59] <freeman_h> 1185
[11:51:09] <freeman_h> is it 11.85 or 1,185
[11:51:30] <freeman_h> its why the need to be a separator
[11:52:03] <freeman_h> looking back at the price from the database from the product prices from the records from 2009
[11:52:55] <AllenJB> My point was replacing , with . in 3,500.50 turns it into 3.500.50 - which is not the same thing (and not sanely parseable as a float or castable to an integer)
[11:53:09] <freeman_h> the price had . to seperate it. highest price is 589,929
[11:54:29] <AllenJB> So this is all data from a single source? Do you really have values in both Â£17,50 (which is doubly weird because in the UK we would never use , to separate Â£ and p) and 200.00 GBP formats?

[11:55:25] *** Quits: brentaarnold (~brentaarn@24.112.56.42) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[11:55:47] <freeman_h> we have different suppliers from across the world, the sent us format differently
[11:55:54] <AllenJB> So that goes back to me suggestion: Use specific format parsing based on the source rather than trying to write a single parser to convert every format in 1 line of code
[11:56:27] *** Joins: toastloop (~toastloop@user/toastloop)
[11:56:30] <freeman_h> AllenJB, understand what you mean
[11:56:45] <freeman_h> the source format is not consistence
[11:57:38] <freeman_h> looking at one supplier format in the last 6 months their format is inconsistence, i believe their file is done manually by varies humans
[11:58:17] <freeman_h> so I need to write 1 or more things which covers some of the examples I have seen so far
[11:59:07] <freeman_h> using the 17,50 has an example. it can be 17,50 or 17.50 or Â£17,50 or Â£17.50 or 17.50 GBP or 17,50 GBP
[11:59:41] *** Joins: joo-_ (~joo-_@fsf/member/joo--)
[12:01:08] <AllenJB> So then I would try to detect which format the value is in, and run a specific parser for that format. This is going to be easier to debug than trying to write 1 line of code to handle every format.
[12:05:13] <freeman_h> AllenJB, can you point me to a starting point please how you will approach this. Thank you
[12:06:36] <TML> freeman_h: Do you know the locale of the values you were provided?
[12:07:35] <freeman_h> TML, nope
[12:08:04] <TML> freeman_h: Then you have absolutely no hope of doing this in any kind of automated way, someone is going to have to go through the values by hand and convert them to a meaningful standard
[12:09:05] <freeman_h> TML, currently the way it is done but it can be automated which is what I have been task in doing so
[12:09:13] <AllenJB> Also consider making a request to your suppliers to implement a single standard format for all future data
[12:09:14] <TML> It cannot be
[12:09:18] <TML> Not without that information
[12:09:39] <Naktibalda> how about finding 3rd character from the end and checking if it is . or , ?
[12:09:40] <freeman_h> AllenJB, has the right answer for this, if I know the possible format of the string I can check it for which format
[12:10:05] <freeman_h> AllenJB, they been asking them for a standard for the last 5 years
[12:10:22] <freeman_h> unfornately it's not on their top list to do
[12:10:38] <TML> freeman_h: I know of at least 12 completely incompatible formats that currency information can be written in, just off the top of my head.
[12:11:01] <freeman_h> TML, list them
[12:11:11] <TML> freeman_h: To what end?
[12:11:16] <freeman_h> if possible
[12:11:27] <AllenJB> And if the data has been input by humans as you say, there could be typos that screw up parsing even more
[12:11:30] <freeman_h> I have suppliers files from the last 10 years to test them on lol
[12:11:58] <freeman_h> am sure I will find an odd case during the test
[12:13:12] <freeman_h> AllenJB, with typos and screws up it will pick it up if the current price and their new price drops below x percentage, it gets sent to someone to check it so i am not worry about that
[12:14:00] <AllenJB> freeman_h: I would start by making an array with a match regex (to initially detect format) and a replacement regex (pair). If the match regex matches, run the replacement regex and continue to the next value / row.
[12:14:26] <AllenJB> It's possible you may find you have to get more complex, in which case I would switch out the replacement regex pair for a callable function
[12:14:28] <TML> freeman_h: fr_CA, fr_CH, fi_FI, de_DE, it_IT, no_NO, es_ES, es_PH, sv_FI, en_GB, en_US, and zh_CN
[12:15:35] <TML> and that's not even getting into the EU stuff, which I am not familiar with (I haven't had to do Locale stuff since before the European Union existed)

[12:18:04] <TML> in ISO 639 format
[12:18:09] <AllenJB> Those aren't currency names / symbols. They're locale names, from which you can derive monetary formats
[12:18:32] <freeman_h> the data I get is in a xlx, csv or xlxs
[12:19:14] <freeman_h> sometimes the heading is price(Â£) and price sometimes the symbol is added with the value
[12:19:42] <TML> freeman_h: I don't carry the respective formats around in my head, I just know that those 12 locales use completely inconsistent rules for writing currencies, and that parsing e.g. en_US formats as if they were fr_FR (or vice versa) will lead to uncorrectable data corruption
[12:20:39] <freeman_h> am lost what en_US and the lot of coming from
[12:20:47] <freeman_h> where en_US*
[12:21:12] <freeman_h> 17,50 or 17.50 or Â£17,50 or Â£17.50 or 17.50 GBP or 17,50 GBP

[17:08:30] <relipse> So, we are in a situation where the OOM-killer killed mysql, the tables crashed and the website went down. This has happened 2 or 3 times within the past several months. I was told and came to the conclusion that we can do a few things: 1. upgrade from 8GB to 16gb, 2. take mysql and move it to its own dedicated server, 3. analyzie the code and see if there are any memory hogs. Is this normal in a lamp stack? Am I missing anything?
[17:09:37] <TinoDidriksen> Those are the options.
[17:09:55] <TinoDidriksen> Oh, you CAN also enable swap space, but that's a band-aid.
[17:10:28] <tex> have swap?
[17:10:36] <Naktibalda> you could reduce memory usage by reducing size of mysql buffers, but it will hurt performance, and by reducing maximum number of php processes
