[01:24:16] <quanticle> some owners have been reckoning with this possibility for a couple years now, though with many 2018 or newer Toyotas still within their subscription trial periods, it's entirely possible that most drivers are unaware of the arrangement.

[03:18:35] <galambo> are you guys sure we don't need a #lw-covid channel?
[03:18:59] <galambo> I have created one anyways
[03:19:09] <gwern> I think most covid discussion is probably harmful, and we should be suppressing it
[03:19:44] <adiabatic> gwern: everywhere, or here?
[03:19:49] <gwern> both
[03:19:55] <adiabatic> …why?
[03:20:10] <adiabatic> ok, easy question first: why here
[03:20:13] <galambo> gwern, we cant ban it but we can move it
[03:20:38] <galambo> maybe name it c19 so it doesnt attract normies from other channels
[03:20:42] <gwern> adiabatic: we bring no new information or analysis, and talking about it basically wastes time while making everyone anxious and upset
[03:20:43] <galambo> lw-c19
[03:20:58] <gwern> even reading zvi at this point is more time and gumption than you should devote to it
[03:21:33] <galambo> gwern, well we can create a channel and then just ask people to post there if they want to talk about it
[03:21:53] <galambo> and just not advertise it in the #lesswrong channel tag
[03:22:16] <adiabatic> "take it to #lw-coof" in addition to "take it to #lw-politics"?
[03:22:28] <galambo> out of sight out of mind
[03:22:45] <catern> how about just taking it to #lw-politics on the general principle that we already have a place for worthless discussions
[03:23:20] <saturn2> there doesn't seem to be much demand for lengthy covid discussions here anyway though?
[03:23:27] <catern> galambo: your investment questions can go there too :)

[03:24:08] <galambo> catern, I dont have investment questions anymore. I consider the topic solved
[03:24:15] <catern> good good
[03:24:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: Did you see the stuff I posted earlier about PHP and "variable variables"
[03:25:08] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: no
[03:25:23] <galambo> can we also make a channel for programming?
[03:25:29] <adiabatic> I got tagged a couple days ago but it went past my scrollback and I didn't go dumpster diving
[03:25:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> galambo: There already is
[03:25:45] <galambo> then can we shift programming discussions to there please?
[03:25:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Empirically, no
[03:26:11] <adiabatic> galambo: the solution is for you to learn how to program and then programming discussions won't be noise to you anymore
[03:26:28] <saturn2> this discussion belongs in #lw-meta
[03:26:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gottem
[03:27:15] <galambo> what is lw-support anyways?
[03:27:31] <adiabatic> emotional support, I assume
[03:28:00] <galambo> why do we need a dedicated channel for emotional support?
[03:28:09] <nshepperd> The nonzero part of the lw distribution
[03:28:50] <gwern> for the heroes, not zeroes
[03:29:11] <saturn2> it was created ages ago, iirc by efm to help fourfire with his psychological problems
[03:29:27] <galambo> there are too many channels. lets just combine them all and then ban the naughty topics
[03:29:33] <catern> those are some old names
[03:29:44] <adiabatic> channels are cheap. more channels means better filtering
[03:30:02] <adiabatic> I don't want people talking about feeeeeelings (wo wo) in my politics or programming channels
[03:31:41] <galambo> ok how about a secret second channel?
[03:32:58] <saturn2> seriously though, this is getting more and more boring and pointless

[06:37:36] <rmmh> gwern: do you understand using triangle inequality? 
[06:37:59] <gwern> no
[06:38:55] <rmmh> first, cluster your 5500 points into clusters, by doing for each point, find its distance from each cluster's start and adding it if under a certain amount, or starting a new cluster if further away
[06:39:35] <rmmh> then, to find top-10 nearest neighbors, for each point you compare it to each cluster, and examine the cluster if it might contain points closer than the current number 10
[06:40:05] <rmmh> which, if you're using a distance metric under which the triangpe inequality holds, is distance(cluster start)-max cluster distance 
[06:40:54] * gwern has implemented the part which filters out links if they are already in the annotation, and writing them all out to .html.html files for popup use. looks good on disk. still waiting on the bruteforce, but is going to rebuild the embeddings with davinci now

[06:46:52] <quanticle> gwern: Kind of impressive, actually
[06:46:57] <quanticle> It drives like a shitty teenager
[06:47:10] <gwern> one that got into the liquor cabinet
[06:47:23] <gwern> 'we'll drive on the tracks like saturday morning cartoons!' 'fuck yeah!'
[06:48:12] <quanticle> I figure that Tesla's FSD is like anime NNs
[06:48:15] <quanticle> Almost there
[06:48:20] <quanticle> But just fucked enough that you can't rely on it
[06:49:38] <rmmh> it's the nonhuman failure patterns that fuck with people 
[06:49:47] <rmmh> even if the absolute accident rate is the same
[06:49:53] <gwern> I find it kinda puzzling. I thought karpathy was a decent dude, so I dunno what's going on. are the internal metrics way better than what we see? is it just hobbled by the onboard compute forcing tiny models? what is going on?
[06:50:29] <rmmh> gwern: I think the focus on vision-only self-driving is entirely financially dictated and makes their job much harder
[06:50:37] <quanticle> Yeah, no sober human would do the railroad tracks thing
[06:50:46] <rmmh> the limited on board compute is probably bad too
[06:51:05] <quanticle> Eh, but would LIDAR have helped it realize that it wasn't supposed to drive down the railroad tracks?
[06:51:20] <gwern> that's also a huge mapping failure
[06:51:35] <gwern> even if it can't recognize train tracks making up its path, that ought to be on the maps
[06:51:44] <rmmh> Tesla has been promising fsd for years
[06:52:00] <rmmh> and the deadlines force them to release underbaked garbage 
[06:52:18] <rmmh> vs waymo being like "ok, we've mastered Phoenix"
[06:52:28] <gwern> rmmh: yeah, the vision-only obviously is bad... but again, I thought Karpathy was decent enough that if it wasn't going to happen, he'd quit and do something better with his time. it'd be embarassing, but he could go anywhere
[06:52:50] <rmmh> artists work best under constraints 
[06:53:20] <quanticle> I think the lack of on-board compute is also a problem there - you see a couple of times where the car just has to stop and process
[06:53:26] <gwern> so I sorta have the opposite problems with waymo and tesla: with waymo, they appear to be so good that I'm baffled how ultraconservative they are and settling for driving around phoenix, while with tesla, they're bad enough that I'm puzzled why everyone there keeps going
[06:53:29] <quanticle> Before it can determine what the next thing to do is
[06:53:54] <gwern> there's clearly *something* I don't understand about each one, but I don't know what it is. is, like, waymo covering up a fatal accident somewhere?
[06:54:25] <quanticle> If Waymo were involved in a fatal accident, I think we'd have heard about it.
[06:54:49] <gwern> quanticle: so you would think!
[06:55:16] <gwern> but that's a bit like saying, 'if a planet Uranus really existed, wouldn't've we have seen it in telescopes already?'
[06:55:55] <gwern> uber covered up the red light running and other incidents before their fatal accident. and Project Chaffeur did hide some pretty serious near-misses
[06:56:18] <gwern> maybe they just observe fatal accidents in simulation runs?
[06:57:34] <gwern> (looks like with davinci, every 100 embeddings costs ~30MB of space)
[06:58:10] <gwern> (so it'll be ~1.6GB total)

[07:04:56] <saturn2> i thought one of the advantages of tesla's approach was that it didn't require maps
[07:05:28] <gwern> doesn't mean you can't, or shouldn't, use them
[07:05:56] <gwern> and it'd have the ever so minor advantage that you wouldn't drive right onto railroad tracks that have been there for probably half a century or more
[07:07:20] <saturn2> but then you have more sensor fusion problems
[07:08:06] <saturn2> and if your vision can't even recognize railroad tracks how much can you trust it for everything else
[07:08:46] <rmmh> you have to pay $10k more for the "rail upgrade" model that knows about forbidden modes of transport 
[07:09:52] <gwern> saturn2: the map could still override the failed camera, but yes, "why even run this?" is the sort of question I ask myself about tesla's systems all the time
[07:14:48] <saturn2> if the map overrides the camera, do you end up driving straight into a wall because the map says there's a road there?

[19:38:45] <feep> like, I could go into extensive detail here about what it means for something to be politics and why gwern's post isn't politics
[19:39:08] <feep> but that's beside the point! that sort of comeback is just a giant neon sign saying "please ban me"
[19:41:05] <feep> dv2: that said, I've recently resolved to be more legible to autistic people, so I'll decode some of the subtext here: "please take it to #lw-politics" == "we think your links make this channel worse, post less or none"
[19:42:12] <feep> it's not an attempt at categorization, it's an attempt at quality filtering.
[19:42:22] <dv2> why are you arguing and insulting me feep
[19:42:25] <feep> or like, quality and tone
[19:42:29] <feep> I am not insulting you.
[19:42:36] <dv2> don't you have something better to do, like masturbating to anime
[19:42:51] * feep shrugs
[19:42:56] <feep> hey, I tried.
[19:43:54] <pompolic> that reminds me of the time i tried to institute a no-politics rule in a chat
[19:44:02] <pompolic> they started asking "is this politics"
[19:44:12] <pompolic> about absolutely everything
[19:44:49] <gwern> my link isn't politics because there are no southern slaveholders today
[19:44:50] <feep> haha, yeah that's when you break out the banhammer
[19:45:06] <two2thehead> pompolic, they went even worse then politics, PHILOSOPHY! :V
[19:45:13] <gwern> it's no more politics than making spicy la italia memes about the german emperor claiming sovereignty over rome
[19:45:53] <pompolic> feep: it's a bit more tight-knit, this trolling is acceptable. there was another user who was just contextlessly posting flamebait though
[19:46:03] <feep> welp

[20:10:19] <two2thehead> I can't speak about education, but entertainment sure
[20:10:24] <pompolic> i think the case for education is stronger
[20:10:38] <two2thehead> that's definitely possible, I just need more priors

[20:14:11] <pompolic> ergo it doesn't have a lot to do with what is useful
[20:14:36] <pompolic> granted, i think for a lot of video games, there's only a few things you can pick up from
[20:14:45] <pompolic> and genuine simulationist games are rare
[20:15:11] <pompolic> it's just that school is a shittier simulated environment
[20:15:26] <two2thehead> yep
[20:15:30] <pompolic> besides School is Not About School etc so it'll stick around methinks
[20:16:11] <pompolic> i also think the me being here is an indirect consequence of seeing a 3d game on the playstation in '99
[20:17:03] <pompolic> "what is this weird magic" -> "i am learning the video game language" -> "actually learning english has opened up so many doors wrt internet" -> "what's an AI box"

[20:18:59] <pompolic> ARM the children (give them handheld gaming devices)
[20:20:26] <pompolic> i am not sure i understand entirely the point about more and less regulation, but i think if someone thinks that they're failing to notice the dimensionality of the problem
[20:20:43] <pompolic> regulation as a volume in a high dimensional space vs 1d regulation axis
[20:23:38] <pompolic> oh yeah i forgot the main point
[20:24:04] <pompolic> i think video games teach you something like what yudkowski described as "charting paths through time" or as consequentialism
[20:24:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> pompolic: It's a reference to a classic rationalist meme ;)

[20:34:30] <pompolic> kind of relevant example: i think i exhibit enough indicia of being transgender but i am not at all
[20:34:41] <pompolic> because the male/female axis is not one i'm interested in
[20:35:02] <feep> um isn't that literally just nonbinary
[20:35:14] <feep> or agender
[20:35:17] <pompolic> probably
[20:35:22] <pompolic> gender is for other people
[20:35:24] <feep> tumblr has been coming up with terms for this for actual decades
[20:35:41] <feep> there is a rich ontology already premade, is my point.
[20:35:50] <pompolic> sure
[20:35:58] <pompolic> i don't like it but that's neither here nor there
[20:36:10] <pompolic> words are useful insofar as they help navigate the space of the problem
[20:36:17] <pompolic> (i am very aggressively visual i think)
[20:36:38] <feep> mm
[20:36:58] <feep> personally I identify as weakgender male, which is I think fairly normal
[20:37:23] <pompolic> probably, especially for lw? or nerds in general?
[20:37:43] <feep> ie. evidentially and biologically and psychologically I'm a  guy, but I don't have a sense of gender perception so this is bootstrapped from body
[20:38:10] <pompolic> but! the indicia: i think it can be said that i experience dysphoria, but it's over what yudkowsky called "running on corrupted hardware"
[20:38:13] <feep> and I don't anticipate that I'd get dysphoria from waking up in a female body
[20:38:35] <feep> because like, my self-image is built live from my body, so a mismatch would just rewrite my self-image
[20:38:35] <pompolic> so i think moving on the male/female axis would not change that
[20:38:46] <feep> yeah
[20:38:55] <pompolic> and flesh/machine is another dimension
[20:39:10] <feep> also my theory is normal for autistic spectrum
[20:39:24] <pompolic> weakgender?
[20:39:25] <feep> cause it falls into the whole "weak social perception" cluster
[20:39:26] <feep> yeah
[20:39:34] <pompolic> that aligns with my experience
[20:39:42] <pompolic> "gender is for other people"

[21:09:41] <PapuaHardyNet> Basically what that means, as far as I can tell, is that your self-concept (see Kaj Sotala's writings for a more rigorous definition) does not have any valence to your biological gender
[21:09:43] <feep> well that's what I think, anyways. obviously there's only one way to find out
[21:10:06] <feep> yeah sounds ... maybe right? I can't fully parse that
[21:10:50] <PapuaHardyNet> in simpler terms, you don't put any value to having a male body over having a female body
[21:10:56] <feep> yeah afaict
[21:11:15] <feep> well   I have a bit of a preference for having a female body, but it's instrumental, not identitarian
[21:11:35] <feep> as a sub, female bodies just seem like they give more options
[21:11:42] <PapuaHardyNet> if being female had a positive valence in your self concept, you'd have gender dysphoria, yeah
[21:11:51] <feep> yeah, and I have agp instead
[21:11:58] <feep> hashtag legalize
[21:12:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Bah, in the glorious transhumanist future we will all have bodies that adjust to give us any "options" we want
[21:12:09] <feep> hecc yeah
[21:12:21] <PapuaHardyNet> anyway, the downside of not valuing having a male body is that you don't promote sexual dimorphism in yourself, which means you can't compete in the heterosexual dating market
[21:12:45] <feep> good thing I'm also not interested in the hetero ... but yes
[21:13:05] <PapuaHardyNet> just pointing out something I consider important, at least personally!

[21:13:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's not a GPL
[21:13:53] <Ralith> it does sometimes feel very strange to me that people get so worked up about which of the two major gender expression complexes they subscribe to

[21:14:59] <aweinstock> it's the most copyleft one IIRC, it ensures people who host a copy of the program as a service/webapp still have to provide source to users
[21:15:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ralith: It's like, you can just pick who you're attracted to on a much more granular basis than "boy or girl", and also you can just do whatever you like
[21:15:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ain't nobody gonna tell you that you can't bake cakes and also lift weights

[21:16:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah
[21:16:19] <feep> and it does feel like... there's a trans/queer conflict in there that's only hidden by approximately everyone involved pretending it doesn't exist
[21:16:28] <PapuaHardyNet> Ralith: not really? man, that's a very programmer-like thinking
[21:17:10] <PapuaHardyNet> see: pretty boys and chads - two very different niches of sexual expression in men, both extremely successful
[21:17:25] <feep> well, that's too reductionist. let's say gender realist vs genderqueer conflict
[21:17:51] <Ralith> yes I am aware that there exist people who do not exhibit the specific idiosyncrasies I am outlining
[21:17:56] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: I'm not convinced those are different niches

[21:18:35] <Ralith> I suspect it's a defensive measure sometimes
[21:18:38] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: well, it depends on the specific pretty boys cluster I guess

[21:20:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: That's definitely not right either though
[21:20:21] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: well, russians are really masculine, right
[21:20:30] <feep> they're like archetypal masculinity
[21:20:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> no I mean your "genderqueer vs. gender realist" thing
[21:20:34] <feep> o
[21:20:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, I'm 100% gender realist, in that gender is definitely real
[21:20:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> I take the Zack M. Davis stance on this topic
[21:21:05] <feep> right but ... like... gwah, this is hard to explain
[21:21:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> We can prove gender with math, which makes it *extremely* real
[21:21:16] <Ralith> overcompensating for being unhappy with their established gender expression, for unstated fear that any divergence from the alternative archetype they switch to will be called out as evidence of their falseness
[21:21:23] <PapuaHardyNet> oh yeah, I agree, Zack has the best model for gender
[21:21:26] * gwern sighs as he looks at the davinci knn results. all garbage. the ada ones looks way better. are the davinci embeddings bad or is there something fucked up about the rp-tree itself, the different knn* functions all return very different sets of results, and usually worse
[21:21:28] <feep> I need a term for the position that gender has an almost moral weight
[21:21:37] <feep> like, not just men are men, but men *should be* men
[21:21:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, somebody should be men, that's for sure
[21:22:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> If it ain't men then who
[21:22:14] <feep> I mean, like, men should conform to the man expression cluster
[21:22:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> We can't just have nobody being men, civilization will collapse
[21:22:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> (As in fact it is doing, right now, as we speak)
[21:22:25] <feep> okay now you're just trolling
[21:22:27] <PapuaHardyNet> well, if the supply of men is low, then we can simply subsidize some transitions to increase the supply
[21:22:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> I am not trolling
[21:22:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> I am 100% serious and not joking
[21:22:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> I think this unironically
[21:23:00] <Ralith> load-bearing men
[21:23:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gender roles are not just descriptive but also normative
[21:23:10] <PapuaHardyNet> Ralith: could you give an example of what you mean?
[21:23:33] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: that's kinda ... like, okay but that's a really shitty way to live for some?
[21:23:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Obviously this conflicts with the other very important value we have, which is indeed that "nobody should be forced to be anything"
[21:24:19] <PapuaHardyNet> oh wait, don't worry, I got it! It is the same as a trans woman doing their best to act female, or a man acting super masculine. It is all roleplay, as an attempt to stave off imposter syndrome
[21:24:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Because yes it absolutely is a really shitty way to live for some, but even aside from that, it's wrong to force people into this sort of thing against their will (we don't need anyone to demonstrate a certain minimum degree of suffering before it becomes wrong, it's just wrong as a baseline)
[21:24:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> So I am totally with you on this
[21:24:50] <feep> mm
[21:24:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> But the other thing is also true.
[21:24:56] <PapuaHardyNet> feep: hold up, how is being a man a shitty way to live?
[21:24:57] <feep> right, that's fair.
[21:24:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> These things are in conflict.
[21:25:14] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: like, I identify as a catperson
[21:25:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> There is no resolution that makes everyone happy and satisfies all our values, because the universe does not owe us that
[21:25:19] <feep> if anything

[21:25:49] <feep> like, it's hard to get less masculine than that!
[21:25:57] <feep> without straight up falling into the trans cluster
[21:26:26] <feep> if you asked me to perform masculinity I'd mostly be pretty unhappy
[21:26:27] <PapuaHardyNet> no no no, I'm curious about your mental model of "being a man" that makes it seem like a shitty way to live - not taking it personally, I do think women have it better in general
[21:26:49] <feep> well, idk because as a bonus I also have a really cartoony view of masculinity

[21:26:59] <Robomot> 55 of the worst album cover art of all time (Throughout time there have been some quite simply, mind-bogglingly bad covers of albums. We've got the worst for you to enjoy.)
[21:27:04] <gwern> being a man must be terrible - at least, seems like you see a lot more men trying to become women than vice-versa
[21:27:07] <feep> so this might be to some extent an imagined conflict
[21:27:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Personally, my view is that the *best* way to square this circle (mostly; realistically we still end up with more of a squircle than a square) is that we should *encourage* unbundling, and acceptance of unbundling, in order to make it maximally easy for people to fill the load-bearing roles and perform the load-bearing traits, without saddling anyone with anything that is offensive to their soul or w/e (as much as it can
[21:27:18] <Obormot\Arcturus>  be avoided)
[21:27:20] <feep> gwern: didn't that change recently, I remember reading that
[21:27:32] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: yeah I'm with that.
[21:27:39] <gwern> (if it did, I didn't hear about it)
[21:27:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: So e.g. if what we need from men is decisiveness, leadership, risk-taking, etc., then we should make it 100% ok to do all of that *and still like ponies* (or whatever)
[21:27:57] <PapuaHardyNet> and if gwern didn't hear about it, I doubt it is true
[21:28:04] <feep> :nodnod:
[21:28:15] <Ralith> PapuaHardyNet: right, and I wonder how many of those cases end up making life way harder than necessary vs. if they'd just discarded the specific parts of their accustomed expression they were unhappy with as needed
[21:28:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: (This runs into signaling-related challenges but that is all second- or third-order, so what I said should be the clear starting point, imo)
[21:28:57] <Ralith> not that there's anything to be done for it but try to move society towards not constantly analyzing the legitimacy of peoples' gender to begin with
[21:29:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ralith: Agreed
[21:29:20] <feep> agreed
[21:29:33] <PapuaHardyNet> questioning the legitimacy of a person's gender is a social attack
[21:29:43] <PapuaHardyNet> it is a way to improve your status in comparison to the other person
[21:29:44] <feep> but I think a lot of it might be keynesian beauty standards
[21:29:48] <PapuaHardyNet> never going to fade away man
[21:29:58] <feep> like, people trying to well-meaningly adjust people towards a perceived schelling point
[21:30:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep, gwern: It's not "more women trying to become men", that's still rare, it's "more women rejecting womanhood in favor of 'I insist that you refuse to perceive me as a woman' [a.k.a. 'nonbindary' or similar evasions]"
[21:30:09] <rsaarelm> We might need a bit more explication of just what the loads we want born are too. Like, I feel like part of the trad memeplex of "don't ask questions, comform as well as you can" is that things are hella complex, nobody actually knows how things work (because peasants are busy trying not do die and don't have time to do science), so your best bet is to just hang on to the culturally evolved
[21:30:12] <rsaarelm> thing for your dear life and any divergence is basically baiting azathoth.
[21:30:16] <Ralith> nah, you know what makes weapons fade away? better weapons :D

[21:32:16] <Ralith> it does a specific thing, use it if that thing is what you want

[21:35:41] <feep> As best as I can tell, LW Tumblr tends to collectively view rationality not as a set of beliefs (i.e. Bayesianism is a useful model of human inference, AI is one of the most important existential risks, Eliezer Yudkowsky is always right) but as a set of topics (i.e. Bayesianism, Friendly AI, Eliezer Yudkowsky). So if you post something like “I hate Eliezer, the Singularity is the rapture for nerds, and effective altruism is 
[21:35:43] <feep> imperialism and we should have full communism instead”, rationalist Tumblr as a whole will conclude that you are a rationalist and trying to be friends, and will behave accordingly.

[23:34:40] <dv2> The name is Bond. James Bond. They, them.
[23:34:49] <feep> this was like a controversy catch-22, no matter which answer it pisses people off
[23:35:03] <feep> and given that, barbara chose the least decisive possible answer

[23:38:36] <gwern> I didn't think the bond part was interesting. I thought the copyright/fanfic part was interesting, in a deadweight loss/Harberger sort of way
[23:39:08] <gwern> we know plenty of copyright holders will abuse their monopolies in many ways, including but far from limited to going woke

[23:44:24] <gwern> this is not necessarily screwing with it ("Dumbledore is gay!" "I didn't really need -" "Snape was a pedophile!") or collaborating in censorship (Seuss), but also just plain dog-in-the-manger squatting like GRRM seems determined to do with GoT
[23:44:38] <gwern> ("Harry has hemorrhoids!" "please stop")
[23:45:06] <feep> right, I agree that it would be that, but... like, I think this is not the bond people doing that but the interviewer doing that.
[23:45:25] <feep> this question was transparently a setup.

[23:45:43] <gwern> you could imagine an IP-less world where all the writers who could, and would, do a GoT ending which is 'better than nothing' compete to write GoT serials, and the best one winds up being blessed by the OG creator (GRRM) and maybe collaboratively worked on
[23:46:06] <feep> futarchy now coming to fanfic, still doesn't mean what you think
[23:46:20] <gwern> as it is, GRRM can just bop around entertaining himself with the cat art collective and random shit and his monopoly remains ironclad no matter how much fanfic is written
[23:46:36] <feep> game of clones
[23:46:47] <gwern> but in the end, there can only be one
[23:47:05] <feep> well, rather, in the end, copyright doesn't even matter
[23:48:34] <gwern> I think it does. it's a very bright line of legitimacy, and good authors ultimately do need da money to work
[23:48:47] <gwern> being so totally barred from any commercialization is a serious problem
[23:49:01] <feep> patreon exists..
[23:49:04] <gwern> not to mention everyone in fanfic communities runs scared of lawsuits and threats
[23:49:04] <feep> but yeah

[23:49:27] <Robomot> Girl dies and three in hospital after 'pest control' chemicals found in block of flats - Daily Record ()
[23:49:28] <feep> I basically agree, I just think it'll all work itself out in due time
[23:49:53] <gwern> it's hard to make comparisons because IP law is so pervasive and we don't have situations where creators of beloved IPs have public domain competitors, except outside FLOSS where we see that forks can overtake the original all the time
[23:50:02] <feep> yeah
[23:50:13] <gwern> if adblock plus is bad, no matter how much of an OG it is, you can fork and defeat it
[23:50:14] <feep> well hm. worm?
[23:50:24] <gwern> what overtook worm?
[23:50:35] <feep> webfics seem like they're in a weaker position, ip wised
[23:50:37] <feep> wise*
[23:51:01] <dv2> Was UB a fork?
[23:51:08] <gwern> if they're original, they're in a pretty normal position. fully copyrighted until stated otherwise
[23:51:10] <feep> well I think what happens with fanfic in general is just that like, five million competitors run off into different directions and nobody can decide which is best
[23:51:22] <feep> I mean, factually yes but culturally no
[23:51:32] <feep> a lot of this is about like, milieu and expectations
[23:51:38] <gwern> dv2: I'm not sure. even if it doesn't copy the exact code, it's pretty much a substitute.
[23:52:24] <feep> or something like touhou, whose copyright is founded almost entirely on "give what you can to support the artist"
[23:52:40] <feep> where that propagates throughout the ecosystem
[23:53:21] <gwern> and of course, a lot of the art and music has long since superseded zun's originals
[23:53:27] <feep> yeah exactly
[23:54:18] <feep> like, could zun enforce copyright?  yeah sure, it would be monumentally stupid but it's not like it's any less stupid when any other author does it
[23:54:35] <feep> that's why I think culture matters
[23:57:00] <gwern> he has an official zun license. it might be hard to enforce anything
[23:57:40] <gwern> at a minimum, there's a ton of estoppels
[23:59:06] <feep> oh? neat!
[23:59:18] <feep> I thought it was just implicit
