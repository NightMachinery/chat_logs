[03:25:53] <Albright> Implementing an activity stream where we want to track if a user has "read" an item yet.
[03:26:14] <Albright> I presume I can basically do a table with foreign keys to the activity stream item and the user ID.
[03:26:43] <Blondie101010> sounds reasonable
[03:27:15] <Albright> But is it better to track "this user has read the item" or "this user has not read the item?" Like do we create the row in the table if the user has read the item, or do we create the row when the item is created and then delete it when it's read?
[03:31:15] <Albright> Off the top of my head it seems like the latter might be more performant but I can imagine we'd fill up the table a lot if users have a lot of items and don't log in for a long time.
[03:31:24] <Blondie101010> that question should not take you more than 20 seconds
[03:31:30] <Blondie101010> be consistent
[03:31:32] <Albright> Maybe track a date and start deleting items over a year old?
[03:31:41] <Blondie101010> if most other flags: are is_this and is_that, do the same
[03:32:02] <Blondie101010> is_new or is_read
[03:32:04] <Blondie101010> whatever!
[03:32:09] <Blondie101010> that does not matter
[03:32:16] <Albright> Hmm, okay
[03:32:38] <Albright> just one of those things where I wonder if there's already an existing best practice.

[03:33:44] <Blondie101010> nonono, it's very appropriate

[07:03:17] <znf> So I have an issue with my build of PHP 7.4 doing different things than PHP 7.2
[07:03:28] <__adrian> this is expected
[07:03:32] <__adrian> !+next
[07:03:32] <php-bot> another satisfied customer, NEXT!
[07:03:41] <znf> I have an app that comes with it's 7.2, and I'm trying to build 7.4 for it.
[07:03:58] <znf> I've used more or less the same flags, and the app works fine... except one tiny detail, the way php-fpm seems to work
[07:04:00] <__adrian> "build for  it"? do you mean, compile?
[07:04:06] <__adrian> why not use your package manager?
[07:04:08] <znf> yeah, compiled it
[07:04:49] <znf> I don't think that will fix my issue, let me explain :P
[07:05:34] <znf> With the 7.4 php-fpm, the fpm process gets created as root, and thus, the app itself can not readlink /proc/PID/exe (as it's running as root)
[07:05:49] <znf> With the 7.2 one (same configs), it gets created as user and it can read it without issues
[07:08:37] <__adrian> i'd start with double-checking your configs
[07:08:46] <__adrian> this is an issue with php-fpm, not php
[07:09:01] <__adrian> how are you running it (e.g., nginx)?
[07:09:41] <znf> nginx yeah, but I'm not touching that between configs
[07:09:43] <znf> Oooh
[07:09:52] <znf> ok, I missed that
[07:10:03] <znf> the previous build has --with-fpm-user= --with-fpm-group=
[07:12:18] <znf> kinda of weird tough, I specify user = and group = in the pool config
[07:12:36] <znf> shouldn't those be taken into consideration instead of the ./configure arguments?
[07:13:32] <__adrian> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[07:13:55] <__adrian> probably wouldn't have this issue if you install via your package manager
[07:14:04] *** Joins: Rockwood (~Rocky@user/rocky)
[07:14:07] <znf> I probably would, 'cose the app is crap? :P
[07:14:17] <Rockwood> o/
[07:14:52] <znf> I *could* spend hours on trying to make the app work with the system PHP, but considering how crap it is, I'd probably waste even more time :D
[07:15:18] <__adrian> the app doesn't have anything to do with it (unless you mean, the "app" is a whole system (e.g., a docker container?))
[07:15:38] <__adrian> php doesn't control what user it's run as
[07:16:01] <__adrian> and any php code you're running certainly doesn't
[07:16:12] <znf> it has a lot of hardcoded stuff in it, and the code is obfuscated, so it expects some things to be... in certain locations
[07:16:13] <Byteflux> The fact that a missed pair of configure line arguments caused this issue is definitely due to compiling your own builds lol
[07:16:49] <znf> Byteflux, yeah, well, company that made it went poof, so at this point I'm duct-taping everything together
[07:16:57] <__adrian> znf: sounds like maybe something that should be put in a docker (if it's not already)
[07:17:38] <__adrian> but point remains, compiling should be close to the last thing you try, not the first. you're asking for trouble that is almost never necessary.
[07:17:48] <znf> it's not, but probably should be, though I don't have *that* much experience with Docker
[07:18:01] <znf> plus I have no idea how Docker would like to push out 38Gbit/s of data
[07:18:13] <Byteflux> Maybe not a bad idea. PHP has official Docker images for FPM, I've had no problems with them. On Debian/Ubuntu there's also Ondrej's PPA which makes installing 7.4 (or 8.0) from apt really simple.
[07:18:35] <znf> yeah, I use ondrej's builds all around for other projects
[07:18:41] <Blondie101010> 48Gbps?
[07:18:42] <__adrian> "> PHP has official Docker images for FPM"  // correction: _docker_ has official images for php
[07:18:46] <Blondie101010> 38Gbps?
[07:18:49] <znf> yes
[07:19:06] <Rockwood> __adrian, hi how are you sir?
[07:19:09] <Blondie101010> doing what?
[07:19:13] <__adrian> hi
[07:19:25] <znf> video streaming
[07:19:32] <Blondie101010> most machines can't give more throughput than that when they do absolutely nothing else
[07:20:07] <Blondie101010> you stream in PHP?
[07:20:07] <znf> the app is written in PHP, so yeah...
[07:20:07] <znf> it's all around crap, like I said
[07:20:09] <__adrian> fun
[07:20:12] <znf> very
[07:21:16] <znf> It craps out a dual xeon platinum 8276 with 256GB RAM with ~6500 users (~38Gbps)
[07:21:27] *** Parts: snakey_h1 (~scott@101.100.131.68) (WeeChat 1.9.1)
[07:22:10] <znf> I think at that point it's simply getting into weird NUMA territories
[07:22:43] <znf> Works fine at 35Gbps (load avg. ~80-90 on 112 threads), then if it goes a tiny bit over 38.5Gbps, all hell breaks loose
[07:22:48] <Blondie101010> so you have an uplink of > 38Gbps or they're internal users?
[07:23:17] <__adrian> taking code that you can't even read all of and upgrading php versions seems... cavalier
[07:23:20] <__adrian> but have fun
[07:23:22] <znf> We actually have 100Gbit across 3 servers at Cogent's DC in NL
[07:23:55] <__adrian> re: docker: you'd still need to run it on suitable hardware. there might be something special to do but i don't think there's any reason it wouldn't work
[07:24:02] <Blondie101010> ever consider multicasting, and saving a lot on bandwidth?

[07:37:08] <znf> hmm, same thing
[07:37:17] <znf> the process *does* run as the user
[07:37:25] <znf> but the stuff under /proc/ is created as root
[07:39:45] <znf> actually, /proc/<pid> is created as user, but all other things under there are created as root
[07:48:52] <znf> yeah, so, it seems there's something weird with the 7.2 build that this comes with -- for any other system I have running (from 7.2, 7.4, 8.0), the files in /proc/<PID> are all owned by root (with 2 exceptions), even if the pool is running as the correct user and group
[07:49:45] <znf> For some reasons, the php build this app comes with, creates the /proc/<PID>/ files as the --with-fpm-user user
[07:52:52] <znf> Could be that php-fpm 7.2 drops permissions in a different way than 7.4 *shrug* weird interaction

[15:07:37] <TernaryOperator> docker doesn't have an init system (typically) so if you want to be able do that type of stuff you typically need something like yep/dumb-init
[15:08:01] <TernaryOperator> but as biberu mentioned might be better to just chuck it in a docker-compose.yml file the you can do `docker-compose stop` etc
[15:31:30] <biberu> TernaryOperator, Koopz: iirc stopping like that will attempt a sigint first, then wait some time before attempting to kill it. that might make restarts slower than needed, so it's nice to ensure that sigint is handled by the process either way
[15:33:18] <biberu> (that's also good to keep in mind when writing your own entry point scripts)
[15:43:07] <biberu> https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stop/ <- yep, see --stop-signal and --time
[15:49:29] <biberu> ^ stop starts with a sigterm, so got to handle that too unless you reconfigure it

[22:14:38] <__adrian> "paule32> i have learnd ... go to peoples that can you give the right answers"  // this is fine, but you need to look into things on your own first.
[22:14:51] <__adrian> if you can't figure something out on your own, that's ok, that's why we're here.
[22:15:10] <__adrian> but if you don't _try_, then people here won't feel like just doing it for you.
[22:15:55] <__adrian> this ^ is more why you wouldn't get answers - not because we "want to be paid." we volunteer time, here. no one is paid.
