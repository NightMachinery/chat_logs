[00:00:14] <companion_cube> ElTimo: you need Oil shell!
[00:00:32] <companion_cube> <hr>
[00:00:44] <ElTimo> Heh, I've thought about it, but never checked it out. Does it suck less than bash?
[00:01:05] <companion_cube> I have no idea, it's just a meme on lobsters
[00:01:09] <dimadima> most things suck less than bash
[00:01:11] <companion_cube> because andyc is not shy about promoting it
[00:01:47] <Brekkjern> s/promoting/spamming
[00:02:05] <dimadima> i want to try an alternative shell
[00:02:16] <cot> tbf most of his oil-shilling comments come with a good deal of meat
[00:02:16] <dimadima> bit i dunno bash/vi mode is pretty solid
[00:02:30] <kline> Brekkjern, the death-trap aircraft, obviously
[00:02:34] <reno> I've been liking fish, although I probably don't use too many fancy things with it
[00:02:37] <dimadima> is oil shell good
[00:02:38] <Brekkjern> kline: Right :P
[00:02:40] <kline> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawker_Siddeley_Nimrod
[00:03:17] <dimadima> that's a very cool looking airplane
[00:03:38] <companion_cube> I like fish
[00:03:54] <companion_cube> if you want something cool there's, err, nushell? https://github.com/nushell/nushell
[00:04:00] <dimadima> thats the other one i've been considering. do you/have you used it companion_cube ?
[00:04:02] <companion_cube> s/cool/hipster
[00:04:12] <companion_cube> nu? not really
[00:04:27] <cot> dimadima: PowerShell! :P
[00:04:37] <kline> dimadima, the weird shape is because it held a bunch of sub-hunting instruments on the outside
[00:04:38] <dimadima> ppl love powershell but i'm on macos
[00:04:56] <cot> isn't pwsh core mac-compatible?
[00:05:03] <kline> dimadima, so it was a standard-shaped aircraft with the bottom bit being an aerodynamic fairing to protect the sensors
[00:05:25] <kline> but this section was not pressurised like the cabin
[00:05:47] <dimadima> kline: are those the engines built into the wing right by the body of the aircraft?
[00:06:07] <kline> oh yeah, its a very old design so the engines were not the standard we know today
[00:06:12] <dimadima> nushell hits you hard right away with that graphic
[00:06:14] <kline> back when they were still experimenting
[00:06:24] <kline> see also the V-force
[00:06:29] <dimadima> i mean the animated graphic that shows you how easily you can list files and sort them
[00:06:37] <kline> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_bomber
[00:06:42] <dimadima> thats cool kline thank you
[00:07:02] <dimadima> are you into aviation?
[00:07:05] <kline> all of these aircraft were essentially the first jet-engined generation of their kind
[00:07:12] <kline> im in the air force
[00:07:19] <dimadima> oh cool!
[00:07:23] <dimadima> super
[00:07:37] <dimadima> so i guess you are, or something :)
[00:08:40] <dimadima> yeah these v-bombers... the vulcans
[00:08:44] <dimadima> so distinct
[00:08:52] <dimadima> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vulcan_Bomber_MOD_45133331.jpg
[00:09:49] <dimadima> it's weird how hard is for me to remember the options to `ls`
[00:09:55] <dimadima> sometimes i open finder to sort things :(
[00:10:02] <cot> kline: us? j/c

[00:10:18] <cot> nice

[15:28:04] <rb> thankfully i was able to wrangle the code enough to enable strict and noImplicitAny recently
[15:28:17] <rb> let's see
[15:28:30] <epilys> c355e3b, do you have anything that doesn't require a month of interviews + take home challenges?
[15:29:08] <rb> it only took about this to get to that point: 331 files changed, 19113 insertions(+), 12613 deletions(-)
[15:29:18] <c355e3b> iirc we only do three interviews, hiring screen, team, your manager.
[15:29:43] <epilys> that sounds sane in comparison
[15:29:45] <c355e3b> and I didn't need to do any take home stuff
[15:29:56] <c355e3b> (but that varies by team, I think the UI people do)
[15:30:10] <epilys> any systems level jobs?
[15:30:25] <c355e3b> pmed you the list
[15:30:35] <c355e3b> the PHP one is systems level

[18:12:05] <iDrougge> wink: 1e9 is a perfectly valid number in JSON.
[18:19:15] <iDrougge> I also encountered numbers returned as strings at a later job. And of course it couldn't be fixed since the world depended on it.
[18:19:35] <iDrougge> And API versioning was anathema to the backend boys.
[18:20:55] <companion_cube> numbers as strings might not be a bad thing…

[18:27:54] <companion_cube> sorry, I mean, if your numbers are integers it can make sense to store them in strings

[18:29:48] <iDrougge> How would you lose precision? And why are we using a hand-written JSON parser instead of an optimised one off-the-shelf?
[18:30:09] <companion_cube> well depends what your parser returns in the number case

[18:30:24] <companion_cube> if it returns a string of the numeric literal then you have a chance of doing the correct thing, yes
[18:33:29] <iDrougge> If you're optimising this kind of cases, maybe you shouldn't be using JSON.
[18:33:51] <iDrougge> And if you're using JSON, you had better implement JSON and not a private subset.
[18:33:56] <companion_cube> it's not about optimization
[18:34:07] <companion_cube> heh, let me test something
[18:35:08] <companion_cube> AH
[18:35:18] <companion_cube> JS can't encode a bigint to JSON

[18:37:13] <companion_cube> maybe not expecting. but that's where you kind of have to.
[18:37:17] <iDrougge> JSON has no limits on the size of numbers; there is no reason to use a string.
[18:37:38] <companion_cube> JSON parsers tend to do, though
[18:37:51] <iDrougge> Then they're not JSON parsers.
[18:37:52] <companion_cube> JSON.parse will try to fit numbers into a float, won't they?

[18:38:11] <iDrougge> Probably, but it's a design issue in a language plagued by design issues.
[18:39:05] <companion_cube> well, I don't know what the alternative would be
[18:39:09] <iDrougge> I could also write a JSON parser that can't handle floating point numbers, but it's not very useful and I can't expect the world to revolve around my bugs.

[18:40:05] <companion_cube> sorry, what
[18:40:11] <companion_cube> I mean, they might have libraries via GMP or the likes
[18:40:11] <iDrougge> If so, they can't sit at the grown-ups' table.
[18:40:20] <companion_cube> but is there any language with builtin bigfloat?
[18:40:55] <iDrougge> Absolutely. Java has it, and I think both Python and Ruby do.
[18:41:04] <companion_cube> python does not
[18:41:09] <companion_cube> python has regular floats, and bigints
[18:41:37] <companion_cube> oh, BigDecimal for java, neat
[18:41:39] <iDrougge> Ah, I thought bignum also could handle float.
