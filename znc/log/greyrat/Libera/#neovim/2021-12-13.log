[00:24:04] <mva> clason[m]: strange thing: adding `setup` to the plugin somewhy makes it optional O_o (so it stops loading by itself). Theoretically, I can do `packadd` in my manual setup, but is there another way to avoid that? 
[00:24:33] <clason[m]> yes
[00:25:20] <guifipedro_> hi, I succeeded doing x11 clipboard with vim ( Using the clipboard as the default register -> src https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Accessing_the_system_clipboard ), but I am failing with neovim, I don't know what do to, tried for an hour. help
[00:25:31] <clason[m]> (sorry: yes, it makes it optional, because packer needs to control the load order to make sure the `setup` is run first. you do _not_ want to mess with that.)
[00:26:28] <mva> uhm.. actually, I just tried to packadd ant it didn't help :-/
[00:26:39] <clason[m]> if it doesn't load itself, you're likely to have forgot `:PackerCompile`

[00:28:12] <clason[m]> yeah

[00:29:09] <clason[m]> (which doesn't fit this channel)
[00:29:40] <clason[m]> I'd suggest starting fresh from clean install (config and pack directory) and a minimal config
[00:30:08] <clason[m]> also, don't be too clever with config. vim wants to do things its own way; fighting it will only lead to tears.
[00:32:28] <zeraphel> InternetCitizen: define where Identifiers may be used in your language, i.e. assignment / calls / etc. use non-capturing groups to look behind / ahead..  Most languages dont actually match identifiers leaving them highlighted as normal
[00:33:02] <guifipedro_> ok, sorry the noise, it's the same in neovim, I was overriding incorrectly the clipboard variable with the wrong value

[00:50:55] <ryantr[m]> How would  I go about debugging why code formatting through LSP sometimes doesn't work? I'm editing c++ and `LspInfo` seems to indicate that `clangd` is running and attached to the buffer. Often formatting works but sometimes it does nothing. I've tried directly doing `:lua vim.lsp.buf.formatting()` but no difference... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/18cf7666395f7841a1799bd3d34e9daf4cc72ebb)

[04:27:11] <ddickstein[m]> I recently added some syntax highlighting rules that are causing syntax highlighting to fall out of sync in all sorts of weird ways. When I actually move my cursor over the lines the syntax highlighting corrects itself, so I don't think the rules are wrong I think the issue is with syncing, but I'm really unsure what to do about it. There isn't any noticeable lag associated with it. Any advice?

[04:27:41] <ddickstein[m]> Manually running `syntax sync fromstart` isn't viable

[14:37:32] <clason[m]> yes, the synchronization with LSP uses these functions, so they would definitely trigger the issues

[19:54:09] <clason[m]> no.
[19:54:28] <LeoNerd> I find that nvim often skips buffer numbers. I don't know why. I have buffers numbered 1, 2 and 5 currently. 3 and 4 do not exist. Why?
[19:54:40] <clason[m]> just create an init.lua in the same directory as your init.vim and delete the latter (you can't have both, that's an error)
[19:55:07] <clason[m]> (you do want to upgrade to the latest version 0.6.0 of Neovim, though)

[19:59:25] <clason[m]> yeah, I thought so. just wanted to mention it for the sake of completeness
[20:02:19] <sunjonSenghanBri> runtime plugins probably create nofile/hidden buffers (and discard them)
[20:02:55] <LeoNerd> I'm not sure I have a runtime plugin either... I'll see if I can reproduce it. I didn't do very much
[20:03:08] <sunjonSenghanBri> do quickfix/loclist use buffer indices too?
[20:03:46] <LeoNerd> Unsure but I don't use those either. I really don't use very many features
[20:04:04] <LeoNerd> About the only thing I can think of is maybe when I lost/regained focus and it detected an mtime update and asked if I want to reload the file, maybe that upset it?
[20:04:56] <clason[m]> not to my knowledge (and test)

[21:21:07] <kylo252[m]> btw, I create a ticket in null-ls about the warning from yesterday. any help is appreciated
[21:21:07] <kylo252[m]> https://github.com/jose-elias-alvarez/null-ls.nvim/issues/428
[21:22:16] <mjlbach[m]> buf.lua is for language servers
[21:22:17] <kylo252[m]> we might have to do something more graceful about that warning, maybe kill the other server or something
[21:23:08] <kylo252[m]> the thing is, I don't think you can run anything along-side `clangd` now
[21:23:08] <kylo252[m]> is that actually intentional? 
[21:23:11] <mjlbach[m]> > maybe kill the other server or something

[21:23:58] <kylo252[m]> mjlbach[m]: I think this is a bit broader than that
[21:24:06] <mjlbach[m]> its really not
[21:24:15] <kylo252[m]> I copied the same exact line from `clangd` to `null-ls`
[21:24:31] <mjlbach[m]> don't use null-ls and clangd at the same time, simple.
[21:24:35] <kylo252[m]> whatever clangd has chosen, should be chosen by neovim at that point 
[21:24:51] <kylo252[m]> mjlbach[m]: as I said, it means I can't use ccls either for example
[21:25:02] <mjlbach[m]> don't use ccls and clangd at the same time, simple.
[21:25:16] <mjlbach[m]> buf.lua is offered for convenience
[21:25:23] <kylo252[m]> well if it's only clangd, then it's fine 
[21:25:45] <kylo252[m]> I'm only worried if it's gonna be more wide spread
[21:25:45] <mjlbach[m]> I don't think you understand the motivation behind that PR nor the internals of how requests are routed in the built-in client.
[21:26:39] <kylo252[m]> exactly, that's what I stated both in the ticket and in my question. I know that these unicode matters are hellish 
[21:27:27] <mjlbach[m]> The current support situation is, all servers attached to a buffer must use the same offset encoding
[21:27:49] <mjlbach[m]> if you want anything else you are SOL
[21:28:08] <kylo252[m]> mjlbach[m]: so if I set both clangd and null-ls to to `utf-8` or `utf-16` and it should work?
[21:28:18] <mjlbach[m]> yes
[21:28:29] <mjlbach[m]> I have no idea if null-ls supports utf-8
[21:28:33] <mjlbach[m]> or utf-16

[21:28:55] <mjlbach[m]> I am just being more blunt clason :) 
[21:29:09] <clason[m]> you are ;)
[21:29:28] <mjlbach[m]> Supporting mixed encodings would require an approach that at this time due to the way buf_request works would have been very messy
[21:29:44] <mjlbach[m]> And to be honest there are three people capable of making the PR and I am not planning to do it anytime soon
[21:29:58] <clason[m]> but, yes, the error is explicit, and the resolution clear and I've twice explained it in the last few days
[21:30:00] <mjlbach[m]> before, the requests would have the wrong position

[21:30:03] <kylo252[m]> also, isn't null-ls basically neovim? 
[21:30:09] <clason[m]> I'm honestly baffled why this is still an issue

[21:30:42] <mjlbach[m]> > also, isn't null-ls basically neovim?
[21:30:42] <mjlbach[m]> I don't know what "null-ls is basically neovim means"

[21:32:06] <mjlbach[m]> You have to remember I basically do not pay attention to null-ls
[21:32:22] <ii14[m]> I think the way it works is just running other tools as subprocesses and then parsing their output
[21:32:26] <mjlbach[m]> it's a bunch of lua functions which hijack the built-in language server client
[21:32:33] <mjlbach[m]> by directly invoking handlers
[21:34:39] <kylo252[m]> > <@kylo252:matrix.org> how do I set it? is it a string or an array? because the array is producing an error
[21:34:39] <kylo252[m]> > also, isn't null-ls basically neovim?
[21:34:39] <kylo252[m]> seems to be a string, why are we setting clangd's as an array then? 
[21:34:52] <clason[m]> I think you're confusing two different settings

[21:35:11] <clason[m]> yes
[21:35:15] <clason[m]> that's a capability
[21:35:20] <clason[m]> not an lspconfig setting
[21:35:24] <clason[m]> you want the setting

[21:36:06] <clason[m]> look at the lean config https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md#lean3ls
[21:36:16] <kylo252[m]> but lspconfig should be just passing it along, that's how I remember we had done it
[21:36:16] <kylo252[m]> there's no reason it would do any extra processing there
[21:36:57] <kylo252[m]> clason[m]: wait, let me read that again

[21:37:40] <mjlbach[m]> I really don't like summarizing the internals of a publicly available plugin with IMO only 300 lines of code to read through
[21:37:47] <mjlbach[m]> it's also greppable

[21:38:59] <kylo252[m]> clason[m]: how are these not the same thing? 
[21:39:02] <kylo252[m]>                   • {offset_encoding} (string): The encoding used for
[21:39:02] <kylo252[m]>                     communicating with the server. You can modify this in the

[21:39:02] <kylo252[m]>                     server.
[21:39:14] <kylo252[m]>                     {on_init}            Callback (client, initialize_result)... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/f2ca0e857c78e4f28fe1ec5e3bd23d4c9b37fed3)
[21:40:21] <mjlbach[m]> lspconfig sets it in on_init, you can also set it directly
[21:40:41] <mjlbach[m]> it's literally just a string on the client object
[21:41:06] <kylo252[m]> yeah, I get that part. it was clason suggesting they're different things
[21:41:16] <clason[m]> no, I was telling you how to solve your problem
[21:41:22] <kylo252[m]> my question specifically was if it's a string or an array
[21:41:24] <LordofLife> Thanks
[21:41:31] <clason[m]> it's a string
[21:41:38] <mjlbach[m]> You're confusing capabilities and the client.offset_encoding string
[21:41:45] <LordofLife> ?
[21:42:01] <kylo252[m]> is either of them an array?
[21:42:01] <mjlbach[m]> no
[21:42:09] <mjlbach[m]> client.offset_encoding is a string
[21:42:10] <kylo252[m]> https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/c37bf4a2e87df0da5895402b01b427442e0633ff/lua/lspconfig/server_configurations/clangd.lua#L35
[21:42:13] <mjlbach[m]> that's been said like 10 times
[21:42:31] <mjlbach[m]> mjlbach[m]: idk how many times I have to say this
[21:44:26] <kylo252[m]> I can't really find more info about `offsetEncoding` in the entire repo. unless ripgrep is ignoring some results
[21:44:35] * kylo252[m] uploaded an image: (226KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/QsUSVlTrzAZeVoXoEPakQUzu/image.png >
[21:45:23] <clason[m]> you're missing the forest for the trees
[21:45:36] <kylo252[m]> so you'll have to be more forgiving that I still can't tell why one of them is set as an array, and then some logic somewhere has to pick one value and send it to the server
[21:45:43] <mjlbach[m]> why are you grepping for offsetEncoding
[21:45:43] <kylo252[m]> clason[m]: help me 😢
[21:45:50] <mjlbach[m]> I have literally spelled it out for you
[21:45:54] <clason[m]> I'm sorry, at this point there's no king's road
[21:46:06] <clason[m]> ELI5 is not a thing
[21:46:13] <kylo252[m]> mjlbach[m]: because if I change that line in lspconfig, then the error goes away. that's what I've been saying
[21:46:16] <mjlbach[m]> client.offset_encoding is a string on client, it's used to determine which byte encoding to send in textdocument/didChange
[21:46:34] <mjlbach[m]> client.capabilities.offsetEncoding is sent to the server during initialization
[21:46:46] <mjlbach[m]> null-ls is not a real language server, the latter probably does not matter for it
[21:47:37] <kylo252[m]> thanks for all the info
[21:47:48] <kylo252[m]> let me try to verify some tests quickly
[21:48:14] <mjlbach[m]> I have 0 idea how null-ls generates text ranges
[21:48:31] <mjlbach[m]> I assume it hooks into our position functions which take an offset encoding
[21:48:49] <mjlbach[m]> tbh
[21:49:08] <mjlbach[m]> this is probably a bit of a fool's errand 
[21:49:24] <mjlbach[m]> any workaround is going to require null-ls doing a dumb utf-8/utf-16 conversion for no reason
[21:49:36] <mjlbach[m]> since null-ls is going to be utf-8 by default since it's operating on the neovim buffer state

[22:02:33] <kylo252[m]> this same settings doesn't seem to affect null-ls, so I'm suspecting it's not possible to make it switch to 'utf-8'
[22:02:56] <kylo252[m]> meaning one would have to force clangd to utf-8

[22:07:42] <mjlbach[m]> the the on_init handle in lspconfig will read the returned offsetEncoding from clangd and set it to what clangd advertises it is using, since you only sent utf-16 the value of result.offsetEncoding will be "utf-16", so client.offset_encoding will be set to "utf-16"
