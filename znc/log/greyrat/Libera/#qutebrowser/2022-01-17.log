[05:06:56] <Dieterbe> hello. every time i start qutebrowser and restore my session, which includes gmai and google calendar, i get blocking popups with the following message:
[05:06:59] <Dieterbe> Allow the website at https://mail.google.com?extsrc=mailto&url=%25s to open all mailto links?
[05:07:19] <Dieterbe> even if i hit 'always allow' it'll always ask me in the future - e.g any subsequent qutebrowser start/session load
[05:08:02] <emanuele6> do you have a config.py file?
[05:08:31] <emanuele6> if you do and you are not calling `config.load_autoconfig()' in it, that is your problem.
[05:11:36] <Dieterbe> aha. i thought that was only for people who were transitioning configs or something. i do use config.py but i don't have configs anywhere else. specifically, i don't set any config through the ui
[05:12:16] <emanuele6> always is set through the ui.
[05:13:17] <emanuele6> you can set that also using config.py if you want.
[05:13:56] <Dieterbe> do you know the setting by any chance?
[05:14:28] <emanuele6> why do you not want to load_autoconfig()?
[05:15:28] <emanuele6> anyway, look at your autoconfig.yml to see what lines qutebrowser added to it for gmail
[05:15:35] <emanuele6> and convert it to python
[05:15:48] <Dieterbe> it would simplify any future debugging of config and behavior, if you can configure it to only load config from the config.py
[05:15:54] <Dieterbe> ok, thanks
[05:16:45] <Dieterbe> oh the autoconfig.yml actually looks simpler than i thought, i'll just autoload it
[05:17:33] <Dieterbe> so 'load settings from the UI' simply means 'load autoconfig.yml file' and nothing else?
[05:18:09] <emanuele6> where did you read that "load settings from the UI"?
[05:18:50] <emanuele6> if you go to qute://help/configuring.html, you will read
[05:18:52] <emanuele6>   All customization done via the UI (:set, :bind and :unbind) is stored in the autoconfig.yml file. When a config.py file exists, autoconfig.yml is not loaded automatically. To load autoconfig.yml automatically, add the following snippet to config.py:
[05:19:53] <Dieterbe> aha. in my generated config.py it talks about 'settings from the UI' but no mention of autoconfig.yml - anyway, you cleared it up, this is great
[05:32:14] <emanuele6> i see

[19:17:45] <Dieterbe> The-Compiler: yes
[19:23:04] <Dieterbe> o
[19:26:37] <Dieterbe> i was referring to the comment in config.py:
[19:26:39] <Dieterbe> ## This is here so configs done via the GUI are still loaded.
[19:26:39] <Dieterbe> ## Remove it to not load settings done via the GUI.
[19:27:37] <Dieterbe> as a new user, it wasn't clear that this means 'load settings from a single yaml file' , even though in hindsight the function call is a good hint. but i didn't know what 'autoconfig' was
[19:38:50] <The-Compiler> Dieterbe: but is it relevant from an user's perspective that it's a single YAML file?
[19:40:21] <Dieterbe> it is very relevant to me. as mentioned above. i like knowing that a config is a simple file, rather than whatever 'autoconfig' might refer to. could've been something like gconf or a binary database, etc
[19:41:05] *** Joins: sudoforge (~sudoforge@wireguard/tunneler/sudoforge)
[19:41:33] <The-Compiler> eww :D
[19:42:29] <The-Compiler> but, if it was that, you wouldn't have used the "always" answer there in the prompt? I feel like the relevant part to clarify is that those dialog answers are part of "settings done from the UI", and not necessarily the format they end up in, no?

[20:24:42] <Dieterbe> i'm not a fan of any config being done into any 'obscure' format. i was hoping qutebrowser only uses text files and am glad to find out it does
[20:25:01] <The-Compiler> yeah, same as for not being a fan :D

[20:28:10] <Earnestly> To be fair, sqlite for history did make quite a huge difference when it came to speed of filtering results
[20:31:54] <The-Compiler> yeah, I guess that one is a bit of an exception, but that was just too much data to make it reasonable holding it in plain text
[20:32:36] <The-Compiler> and at least it's easy to get plain text out of sqlite again

[20:56:23] <Dieterbe> that seems like the best compromise for history. it's not really config anyway. i want config in text so i can version control it in git. but i wouldn't keep my history in git
[20:57:02] <Dieterbe> with uzbl i went overboard. not everything needs to be textfiles and pipes...
[20:58:06] <The-Compiler> it was quite controversial when the history format changed from plain text to sqlite though :D
[20:59:05] <Dieterbe> i don't remember that. if i was against that i was probably wrong. but maybe that was after my time
[20:59:50] <The-Compiler> I mean in qutebrowser
[21:07:05] <Dieterbe> ah. this brings up another interesting point though. i noticed that qutebrowser.org doesn't describe a specific opinionated set of goals.  it says 'similar to other browsers'.. 'keyboard bindings' , some problems with webkit, the webextensions api, etc
[21:07:57] <Dieterbe> maybe a vision statement on the home page could be good. so people immediately get an idea of why they would use qutebrowser over anything else
