[10:22:18] <Enfors> sm2n: No, but from what I've seen, it takes a few hours to get a response.
[10:29:56] <narwic> what do you need sm2n ?
[10:31:57] <sm2n> nothing, just wondering whether to stay here
[10:32:10] <sm2n> but I migrated to org-roam v2 recently and it's pretty nice
[10:32:12] <zaeph> I haven't done a great job of keeping up with answers in here, but the goal is to eventually start answering questions in a timely (EU) fashion.
[10:32:18] <sm2n> so that's nice
[10:32:25] <sm2n> ah, cool
[10:32:44] <Enfors> zaeph: That's appreciated.
[10:33:05] <zaeph> I'm still pushing for this to replace Slack one day, with Discourse left for longer, more design-oriented discussions.
[10:33:19] <sm2n> I hope that happens
[10:33:26] <zaeph> Well, here's hoping. :)
[10:33:42] <Enfors> Slack seems to be very un-Emacs, I think? IRC seems like a better fit.
[10:33:47] <sm2n> zaeph, thanks for orb btw, it's been invaluable for me
[10:34:07] <sm2n> Enfors, well, there is emacs-slack, but yes slack is not very open if that's what you meant
[10:34:31] <zaeph> Enfors: It is, but it was an early decision that allowed us to foster more discussion early on, considering that the bulk of our users were from academia and hadn't heard of IRC.
[10:34:38] <Enfors> sm2n: Yes, I guess that is what I mean. It's not exactly open source.
[10:34:58] <zaeph> sm2n: You're welcome, although I was mostly involved with the design steps early on.
[10:35:11] <Enfors> zaeph: Well, whatever allows people to communicate is good.
[10:35:26] <sm2n> I guess I will ask a question then, I guess
[10:35:35] <zaeph> Enfors: It is, but considering Slack's lack of memory for non-paying projects, it's sub-par for legacy.
[10:35:52] <Enfors> Good point.
[10:36:06] <sm2n> I've been trying to use org-roam more for taking notes on websites, games, random multimedia really
[10:36:18] <Enfors> But then again, you can't really log IRC anymore either, due to GDPR if I'm not mistaken.
[10:36:41] <sm2n> I have a really nice setup with orb for books, which is great, but I'm not sure how to extend it
[10:36:47] <Enfors> (but let's focus on sm2n's question now)
[10:36:59] <sm2n> using biblatex for the other stuff feels odd
[10:37:36] <sm2n> I saw that in the org-roam v2 migration thing there was something about using urls as reflinks for this, but I'm wondering what other people do
[10:37:47] <zaeph> I personally use biblatex and don't find it too clunky; however, with the nearing release of oc.el, we'll probably have to significantly refactor the part of the code dealing with org-ref.el.
[10:39:11] <zaeph> And it feels like too much of an open-ended question for me to answer properly.  More often than not, if we though that something was a good way to extend our system, we've thought of it and implemented it.  So, it's better to go at it with the idea that you haven't found a way to do something, and then we can ascertain for you if this is really the case or if there is already an implementation.
[10:39:44] <zaeph> I'm on holiday right now, and can only make it in front of a computer during CEST evenings; I'll be around more next week.
[10:40:00] <narwic> agree re: slack/irc
[10:40:17] <zaeph> Well, I know that I'm preaching to the choir in here. :o)
[10:40:26] <narwic> heh, true
[10:40:35] <sm2n> zaeph, I suppose that's true
[10:42:00] <sm2n> I guess I will just hack stuff and see if I get something satisfactory, as is the emacs tradition
[10:42:22] <zaeph> â€¦Or just ask questions so that we may help with discoverability.
[10:42:40] <sm2n> I think part of the problem is that I don't have a good way to add a url to my .bib database
[10:42:51] <zaeph> biblatex would help with that.
[10:43:07] <sm2n> as in the program?
[10:43:34] <zaeph> Well, it's a program *and* a format.
[10:44:38] <sm2n> right, I know how the entries should be structured, but what I want is org-capture or whatever autoadding the entry
[10:45:08] <sm2n> it's not an issue for books because I can just add the isbn before reading the book, but the turnaround time is much shorter on web stuff
[10:45:10] <zaeph> Appending to a .bib?
[10:45:12] <sm2n> yeah
[10:45:36] <zaeph> I just use Zotero for interacting with .bib files.
[10:45:40] <zaeph> I mean, appending.
[10:45:52] <zaeph> I can see how it would conflict with some workflows.
[10:46:01] <zaeph> I have to head off now; talk to you later.
[10:46:07] <sm2n> see you
[10:46:18] <sm2n> maybe I will try zotero
[10:46:26] <sm2n> I just don't want to introduce another source of truth
[10:47:14] <narwic> I've never used .bib or anything like that
[10:47:23] <narwic> I don't really know the purpose of bibtex even
[10:47:59] <sm2n> well it's for managing bibliographic references in latex, but somewhere along the line it became a more general purpose thing
[10:48:00] <narwic> I gather its some kind of cite / reference manager?
[10:48:30] <sm2n> have you used LaTeX before?
[10:49:00] <narwic> here and there, but primarily as an export format for org docs
[10:49:43] <sm2n> the idea is that you can store all your information about citations/references in a declarative way, and then the program (bibtex/biblatex/whatever) will typeset it in whatever format you desire in your latex document
[10:50:05] <sm2n> .bib files are files that store the relevant information
[10:50:23] <sm2n> you can use them with citation commands in latex
[10:50:39] <sm2n> and it'll produce your footnotes or whatever you want
[10:50:40] <narwic> I suspect there's some kind of insertion mechanism so you can re-use previously cited references?
[10:51:15] <sm2n> yeah, the recommended thing for power users is to keep a single .bib file with everything you ever referenced ever
[10:51:50] <sm2n> it's a plain text database of bibliographic information
[10:52:09] <sm2n> de facto standard of sorts, most things provide it, even publisher websites
[10:53:11] <narwic> Hmm. I can't think of a use case for personal stuff - I think I use org-roam to do what I would do with a .bib db
[10:53:34] <narwic> just linking out to stub files of authors and works, though I'm sure the format is nicer if I were to export
[10:53:40] <sm2n> well, org-roam-bibtex is very nice
[10:54:19] <narwic> hmm
[10:54:21] <sm2n> but I guess it's not a huge benefit if you don't write stuff with citations
[10:54:52] <narwic> I primarily started with org-roam for worldbuilding / fiction writing to keep track of and connect ideas
[10:55:08] <narwic> not a lot of citation stuff there, though obviously your notes grow into tons of other arenas you never predict
[10:55:40] <narwic> I guess it might be good to keep track of the book I read an idea in that way?
[10:55:46] <cipherrot> I work in academic-adjacent stuff so using bibtex to store references is very natural
[10:56:10] <narwic> I take notes on astronomy stuff from academic papers pretty frequently too I guess.
[10:57:10] <narwic> yeah I bet its great for that
[10:57:42] <cipherrot> Also, almost every academic article will have a doi (digital object identifier) and you can get bibtex for it regardless of whether the publisher provides that directly https://citation.crosscite.org/docs.html#sec-4
[10:57:44] <narwic> I had an actual astronomer share some sample notes with me on slack - he had all kinds of nice citations. Thinking back, I bet that was org-roam-bibtex
[10:58:35] <narwic> it dawns on me that bibtex is probably an extension of LaTeX
[10:58:43] <sm2n> yes
[10:58:48] <narwic> and probably pronounced "bibtech"
[10:58:56] <sm2n> that is also correct
[10:58:59] <narwic> epiphany moment
[11:06:48] <narwic> thanks for all the info sm2n - this looks pretty rad. good to have in the back pocket if I ever need it.

[17:32:09] <Enfors> Newbie question: I started my first ZK yesterday, and today I started a new job. If I want to use ZK and org-roam at my job, should I put everything (provided it's not sensive client info, etc) in the same ZK, or should I keep separate private and work ones?
[17:33:25] <leah2> usually it's recommended to make one, but it also depends on how many connections you expect
[17:34:08] <Enfors> Yeah, that makes sense.
[17:34:13] <leah2> https://zettelkasten.de/posts/how-many-zettelkasten/
[17:34:29] <Enfors> Ah, perfect - thanks!
[17:35:15] <leah2> also with org-roam, you really can make two directories of files and still link between them
[17:36:14] <Enfors> I see. If you keep a sort of work diary, specifying what you did each day - that's not something people keep as notes in a ZK, right? ZK is more "my knowledge", right?
[17:36:50] <leah2> yes, but i think the two things go well together
[17:37:00] <leah2> you can keep diary posts and link to permanent notes
[17:37:15] <leah2> and move things you learned to permanent notes and just keep track of when you did this
[17:37:33] <Enfors> What do you mean by "diary posts"? Do you mean ZK notes?
[17:37:38] <leah2> i mean daily notes
[17:37:47] <leah2> like, using the date as id
[17:38:57] <Enfors> I'm not sure I understand. Should be diary posts be org-roam notes in your ZK, or a separate thing?
[17:39:20] <Enfors> By "should", I guess I mean "do you recommend".
[17:39:23] <leah2> imo use org-roam-dailies-*
[17:39:35] <leah2> but it's not part of the classic ZK method
[17:39:59] <Enfors> Oh, I see. I had heard of those, but haven't looked into them. Thanks. 
[17:40:15] <leah2> it's just a shortcut that gives you a new note every day
[17:40:49] <Enfors> Do people usually keep todos as ZK notes? I've used org-mode for work todos for 10+ years, not sure if I should switch those over to org-roam or not now.
