[03:55:30] <Joanna> Are those smart meters a mesh network?
[04:05:03] <jan6> dunno where you're seeing smart meters
[04:22:51] <Joanna> The us has them

[04:47:12] <jan6> unlikely, unless you've set them up
[04:47:37] <jan6> but you sure can network via the power grid, there's even specific adapters for that
[04:49:50] <jan6> unauthorized access is illegal, after all, technically even free wifi

[04:50:45] <jan6> Global Chip Shortage Forces Canon to Sell Ink Without DRM
[04:59:18] <Joanna> Thatâ€™s good
[05:00:11] <jan6> it's also hilarious how the instructions are just "press OK" and "press I Accept"

[05:10:48] <Joanna> Iâ€™ve wasted a lot of money on ink that dried out before I realized that I could print without all the inks being operational on color printer

[06:26:21] <iz> yeah, never again to ink jet, b&w laser is all you need
[06:37:01] <Joanna> Everything is designed poorly on purpose I think
[06:37:46] <jan6> well, yes and no
[06:38:00] <jan6> everything is designed as poorly as people can get away with
[06:38:08] <Joanna> Itâ€™s impossible to even buy clothes that are made properly anymore. How many thousands of years of practice does it take?
[06:38:20] <jan6> if you'll buy the thing ANYWAY, why put extra effort, if you'd just buy another one
[06:38:55] <Joanna> A lot of things I want donâ€™t exist unless I make them myself
[06:39:20] <jan6> it's not impossible, but most of the main brands prefer you to re-buy your clothes, since you'd want "fashion" anyway
[06:39:42] <jan6> most of the things DO exist, problem is they don't exist near you, as far as you know ;P
[06:40:10] <jan6> or at least someone is willing to make it for you
[06:40:11] <Joanna> Good luck buying something nice with any natural material besides cotton...
[06:40:20] <jan6> wool? ;P
[06:40:30] <jan6> and linen clothes are still a thing
[06:40:52] <Joanna> If you find wool at all the color and style will be ugly
[06:41:16] <Joanna> Everything is polyester practically
[06:41:39] <Joanna> Even nylon is scarce
[06:42:08] <jan6> if you shop at only main big stores, your world is a dystopia, yes
[06:42:26] <jan6> you just need to put in extra effort for anything else
[06:43:32] <Joanna> I just spent 24 days making a balaclava that could probably be made a lot faster by machine but people with machines refuse to use wool
[06:44:33] <jan6> there's a LOT of 100% merino wool balaclavas around, at least by the label name
[06:44:34] <Joanna> Nothing is made locally. You canâ€™t just order a knitting factory to make one item with your specs.
[06:44:47] <Joanna> Never seen one ever
[06:45:36] <jan6> of course, just like you probably will never see a good quality hammock or proper rugged backpack, in a non-specialized store
[06:45:50] <Joanna> Itâ€™s hard to find true leather shoes anymore. They  always have plastic parts that break
[06:45:59] <Joanna> Nope
[06:47:07] <jan6> things exist, but if 80% of people don't care, then they won't be advertised and well available outside their fandoms
[06:47:23] <Joanna> I once had a cashmere sweater from LL bean that broke the first time I wore it and had to be returned at my expense
[06:47:33] <jan6> LL?
[06:47:49] <Joanna> That the name of it
[06:47:56] * jan6 sleeps, tho
[06:48:03] <jan6> it's many hours too late
[06:48:13] <Joanna> It was once high quality us made stuff
[06:48:36] <jan6> also there's always gonna be more defective products than usual
[06:49:28] <jan6> if it's not handmade or well tested, then most production lines are gonna have "passable" but not "good" samples
[06:49:32] <Joanna> What does it take to make a sweater with a reinforced neck part, I hate repairing things that werenâ€™t made properly
[06:50:22] <Joanna> I go to stores and see tote bags with handles sewn to the very top of the bag
[06:50:48] <Joanna> What kinds of idiots are designing and buying these things?
[06:50:59] <jan6> if it works for most people, then who cares if it'll fray and break in <= half a year
[06:51:13] <jan6> more money to the makers
[06:51:21] <jan6> the more things you buy, the richer they get
[06:51:37] <jan6> also the less effort they put in, the more money they get
[06:52:09] <jan6> as long as people buy crappy products, the companies have no need whatsoever to raise the bar
[06:52:26] <Joanna> Itâ€™s so wasteful. People built better stuff back when it took more effort
[06:53:39] <Joanna> I once saw an amazing Masonic temple whose foundation was prepared by a team of black men with mules

[16:49:46] <ilikeyou> the problem i find with clothing, is the really good quality/desirable products are suuuuper  expensive. the great clothing i have from years ago would be at least triple the price today

[17:53:54] <Joanna> ilikeyou: just because itâ€™s expensive doesnâ€™t guarantee itâ€™s better made Iâ€™ve seen expensive things that arenâ€™t any better than cheap things. The thing I ponder is this.. if itâ€™s not even possible to make simple things correctly how are we to know that dangerous things like airplanes and cars arenâ€™t just as poorly made...
[17:55:41] <Joanna> Sometimes there are Walmart things fairly well made from cotton that are practically free thanks to sweatshop  labor.
[17:58:17] <Joanna> One thing that really pisses me off is when they make something from nylon and donâ€™t bother to melt or zigzag stitch the edges of cloth before they sew it together so the seams pull out and unravel and itâ€™s very hard to fix.
[18:00:49] <Joanna> Or when they mix leather and plastic and the plastic part breaks so the whole thing has to be thrown away even though the leather part is in good condition.
[18:01:42] *** Joins: s1gyn (~s1gyn@user/s1gyn)
[18:03:05] <Joanna> I once had leather shoes and they put vinyl in the inside of shoe at back and it got cracked and started scraping the back of my foot.
[18:04:56] <Joanna> I really prefer to craft my own clothes at least they will be made right. Unfortunately Iâ€™ve lost access to my sewing machine :(
[18:09:00] <ilikeyou> if you have that skill, all the better. like any other industry ever, if they can monopolize, they will. whether its clothing, energy, precious materials, trade etc.
[18:10:28] <ilikeyou> what it takes is strong competition from quality designers who won't cut corners. hard to find these days
[18:14:48] <Joanna> I think the main problem is cultural. The idea of making your own stuff has been stigmatized. Same goes for being a farmer or doing any type of menial work. People used to make all their own clothes. Maybe they bought the materials sometimes.
[18:16:56] <Joanna> Itâ€™s kind of tedious but itâ€™s also satisfying to knit a bunch of yarn into something useful and watch it take form . Maybe Iâ€™m just strange...
[18:18:51] <Joanna> It started when I wanted more lace shirts and they didnâ€™t exist. So I started trying to make them. The early ones werenâ€™t very good.
[18:20:31] <Joanna> Itâ€™s so annoying having choices of what is in stores dictated by far away strangers.

[19:07:45] <jan6> 16:44 <Joanna> I think the main problem is cultural. The idea of making your own stuff has been stigmatized.
[19:08:05] <jan6> not really, it's just that it's vastly more convenient to buy ready made stuff
[19:08:39] <jan6> most people would be impressed if they learned that you make your own shirts, or stuff, but they probably won't see the point WHY would you do it
[19:26:31] *** Quits: BiggieSmalls (~BiggieSma@user/biggiesmalls) (Quit: Leaving)
[19:43:57] <fnk> yeah, and in modern capitalist societies people basically work their asses off to pay their rent/mortgage, or even to just get by
[19:44:13] <fnk> when you're constantly tired you don't really have time and energy to learn how to make stuff
[19:44:21] <fnk> that's the "cleverness" of this system
[19:50:27] <iz> well, there are economies of scale happening also
[19:50:53] <iz> it's way more cost per unit to make a few units vs making many units
[19:51:14] <iz> that's why just having everyone make thier own stuff isn't sustainable
[19:52:54] *** Joins: Atque (~Atque@user/atque)
[19:59:55] <jan6> that too, but scale != bad quality
[20:00:18] <jan6> and things are priced at around the point of the old non-scaled approach ANYWAY, lol
[20:00:54] <jan6> you still have plenty of $100 jeans, even though making them requires no human action, anymore
[20:02:19] <JimBuntu> I find knitting to be calming, I supposed it doesn't need to be though, not if you are trying to reach a quota.
[20:03:15] <JimBuntu> I made a nice flatbill cap, turned out pretty nice, other than I ended up making it a bit too small for my head, lol, one of my kiddos wears it now.
[20:04:41] <JimBuntu> fwiw, the flatbill cap was not knitted, lol, that was a mix of suede and wool.
[20:07:13] <JimBuntu> The issue of affordability and scale bites me too often.  An upcomming projects involved making a large swaddle blanket... the fabric alone is quite expensive let alone that there is a premium to buy it in the widths I want.  What I did figure out though is that I will be able to buy bed sheets instead and simply repurpose the fabric and save quite a lot compared to buying the fabric raw.
[20:09:00] <s1gyn> I scavange things people dump in the desert
[20:09:46] <iz> yeah, knitting is cool
[20:09:48] <JimBuntu> I'm known to scavange from garbage piles people leave out, but not the desert, lol
[20:10:13] <iz> there is something nice about making your own stuff, i agree.. but it's not for everyone and it's also nice to make stuff for your friends
[20:11:02] <JimBuntu> Yes. Stuff for/from friends and family says 'I cared enough to spend my most valuable thing, time, on this for you'
[20:11:10] <iz> and in that, you can already see the benefit of those who have the better means of production to be doing the producing.. whether it's fabrication machinery or just greater skill
[20:11:43] <iz> yeah, and those things have more value when you know who made them.. at least at a sentimental level
[20:12:08] <s1gyn> I've got buckets, hoses, for parts radios, deguassing coils from CRT TVs(for radio stuff), coax cable, lumber, PVC pipes

[20:14:36] <JimBuntu> hahaha, far too many
