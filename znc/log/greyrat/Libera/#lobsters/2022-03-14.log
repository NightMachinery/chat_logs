[18:51:41] <amazigh`> here is the program I use for my blog https://hyper.dev/maji.py I also use pandoc to render single page html. It is missing the feed. That allows me to separate the feed, and the website layout.

[18:53:13] <amazigh`> e.g. I will be able to post an update done in page of the website, that is not necessarly inside the flow of regular blog post. I am trying to approach to be able to build documentation about my projects instead of scattering the doc across several posts.
[18:53:26] <wink> companion_cube: anything really. depends on what you need. maybe your blog doesnt need forms and EVERYTHING. maybe bootstrap is just fine

[19:01:27] <companion_cube> for me it's also that it's so, err, convoluted, to have it separate from the dom

[19:01:46] <epilys[m]> yeah it's a small introduction difficulty curve but not incomprehensible if you're already able to understand computing concepts
[19:02:40] <epilys[m]> it's not really separate, it defines how the dom is laid out :D
[19:03:16] <wink> what might help is separating CSS into 2 things
[19:03:17] <epilys[m]> CSS today at least makes more sense than 5-10 years ago
[19:03:24] <wink> a) layout and b) style
[19:03:30] <wink> ignore style and just learn the box model
[19:03:45] <wink> then style is really an easy addition (except the inheritance)
[19:04:02] <wink> CSS 20y ago was a bucket full of pain
[19:04:06] <wink> cross-browser, cross-OS
[19:04:31] <wink> but we used table layouts anyway :P
[19:04:52] <feoh> companion_cube: My 5K foot view - start with no CSS. Think about what layout/format changes you NEED.  Keep it light and keep your expectations meager.
[19:04:55] <companion_cube> maybe I should find a book to read
[19:05:02] <feoh> companion_cube: Researching small changes is falling off a log easy
[19:05:37] <companion_cube> see, keeping it simple with low expectations is what bootstrap gives me :D

[19:22:53] <demize> The RSA SecureID ones like the one I just linked to?  ;)
[19:23:18] <JordiGH> Right those, are those still around?
[19:23:21] <JordiGH> And how do you resynch those?
[19:23:22] <demize> I don't think those are actually HOTP, but same idea.
[19:24:13] <demize> I don't know about those in particular, but generally they do something akin to HOTP.
[19:24:42] <demize> And they re-sync the sequence on every use by checking forwards a bit, in case you've requested a few more codes than you've used.
[19:25:46] <demize> Oh wait, you're right, the SecureID ones are time based, huh.
[19:26:29] <demize> > Normal token clock drift is accounted for automatically by the server by adjusting a stored "drift" value over time.
[19:26:38] <demize> So the server keeps track of the tokens clock drift over time.  :p

[20:39:43] <iDrougge> As part of school in 1994, I spent a week with DEC's support technicians.
[20:40:46] <iDrougge> I remember how we once went ot a warehouse and picked out an UART board and drove to replace it in an old MicroPDP 11 in a cupboard at a local employment agency office.

[21:28:42] <gwozniak> Instead of seeing the PDF, it showed a page that said "This is a protected document. You can view it using a supported PDF reader app."
[21:28:58] <gwozniak> Then showed icons for Windows, macOS/iOS, and Android
[21:29:06] <JordiGH> i.e. Acrobat-only?
[21:29:35] <gwozniak> No idea.  It did not list Abobe as an app.  It just showed icons for operating systems
[21:30:16] <technomancy> haha what's up with people calling acrobat "adobe"?
[21:30:44] <gwozniak> Then is said, "Learn about about PDF documents protected by Microsoft Azure Information Protection"
[21:30:51] <JordiGH> That's like when people call Alpha "Wolfram".

[21:31:16] <technomancy> JordiGH: the wolfram one is a lot more understandable because "alpha" is usually used as a modifier to a name
[21:31:19] <JordiGH> Tim Apple did get called that, though.
[21:32:50] <technomancy> that's like calling your product "2.0" and complaining that it confuses people
