[19:31:39] <re101-bear-94> teh delimited is double :
[19:31:47] <digitok> 07rapha, your regex only allows one char after <name
[19:32:09] <re101-bear-94> and any part ahead of the 3rd occurrence i need to replace with null
[19:33:09] <digitok> so 07a::b::c::d::e becomes 07a::b::c::?
[19:33:17] <digitok> or 07a::b::c

[19:38:23] <re101-bear-94> let me try
[19:39:23] <ExeciN> Hi people. How can I emulate vscode's find with "match whole word" flag turned on and "regex" flag turned off? I was thinking to enclose my pattern with \b when "match whole word" flag is on but with regex off, \b wouldn't work
[19:39:24] <re101-bear-94> ^(?:.*?::){2} 
[19:39:33] <re101-bear-94> this works for me ..thanks a lot
[19:39:51] <digitok> ok :) yw
[19:40:17] <ExeciN> I could escape everything and then wrap it in 
[19:40:22] <ExeciN> *wrap it in \b
[19:41:32] <digitok> no idea what you're asking tbh
[19:42:31] <rapha> digitok: i tried putting a + there but obvi that doesn't work ... prob is, i don't know how to combine repetition (+ or star) with maybe-ness (?)
[19:42:56] <ExeciN> I forgot to mention, I'm using ripgrep to find stuff in files
[19:43:18] <digitok> * would include maybe-ness
[19:43:27] <digitok> since it's 0 or more
[19:43:40] <rapha> oooh right
[19:43:59] <rapha> always afraid of *'s greedyness
[19:44:06] <rapha> but in this case it doesn't give problems
[19:44:13] <digitok> you should be
[19:44:43] <digitok> <name[^>]*> would be the easiest method

[19:51:01] <digitok> and to solve the issue rewt mentioned, you can either use [^<]* if there won't be nested tags or .*? if there will be
