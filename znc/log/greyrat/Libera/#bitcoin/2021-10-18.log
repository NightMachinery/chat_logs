[21:42:38] <bitcoins> we need alternatives
[21:43:12] <AndyS2> Not checking signatures with your node would be very stupid
[21:44:02] <bitcoins> Not stupid. Some people running Bitcoin 0.8.1 from 2013
[21:44:43] <AndyS2> Just because someone does something doesn't mean it isn't stupid ;)

[21:47:05] <bitcoins> Why segwit is good? What is the reason? I dont understand
[21:47:13] <AndyS2> Code? Other projects surely reimplement the rules with their own code
[21:48:38] <AndyS2> It stopped transaction malleability (you could essentially change the ID of a bitcoin transaction after it was signed AFAIK), and native segwit is smaller than other transaction types (in actual bytes, not only vbytes), so it saves some space
[21:48:56] <AndyS2> and it makes new transaction types much easier to implement (less chances for bugs)
[21:49:06] <AndyS2> among other things I probably forgot
[21:49:25] <AndyS2> It's just a neat idea that hadn't been realized before, all in all

[21:51:19] <bitcoins> Thanks. So you say that in the original Bitcoin client was dangerious? Someone stolen some Bitcoin or this os just a theory?
[21:52:49] <bitcoins> Of course "80%" of the transactions use segwit because this forks was forced on us with one single client
[21:53:01] <AndyS2> if you change the id and mine the tx, it still pays the same people. but if you check the old id on a block explorer, it might not show up
[21:53:15] *** Joins: ___nick___ (~quassel@cpc68286-cdif17-2-0-cust533.5-1.cable.virginm.net)
[21:53:51] <AndyS2> IIRC that was used in some bitcoin thefts where exchanges were hacked so it looked like the bitcoin hadn't left the wallet yet, but I'm not sure
[21:54:41] <bitcoins> Segwit aware nodes can send Bitcoin to non-segwit nodes or it is not backwards compatible?
[21:54:51] <AndyS2> It can still happen with old style transactions, but if you only do segwit-tx it can't happen
[21:55:27] <AndyS2> Bitcoins don't travel from node to node, but from inputs to outputs (addresses)
[21:55:50] <AndyS2> and yes, you can send bitcoin from segwit inputs to old style outputs/addresses and vice-versa
[21:56:29] <bitcoins> How the old node would verify such transaction?
[21:56:47] <AndyS2> that's why it would be stupid to not look at the segregated witness part with your node, it has the signatures that tell you if the person owned the coins in the first place
[21:57:17] <AndyS2> the old node can hope that the rest of the network did the right thing and only included tx that had a correct witness
[21:57:48] <AndyS2> but there's no guarantee if you aren't your own (responsible) bank
[21:58:14] <AndyS2> and check the witness yourself
[21:58:53] <bitcoins> Who approved segwit? There was any vote or it was just merged without any concensus?
[21:59:26] <AndyS2> Explained simply, segwit is mostly a 'if you see a transaction that looks like this, also look at that other part of the block, you'll find something that you also gotta check to see if the tx is really valid. if that isn't valid, the tx is bs'

[22:01:57] <AndyS2> I'm not the best person to ask about the history. I remember there being lots of agreement about including the change, but users and other non-mining-node runners also felt the need to show that they agreed with the change, which is why they ran software that showed it
[22:02:09] <earnestly> AndyS2: It's zoltan
[22:03:51] <AndyS2> bitcoins: if you get everybody to not hold bitcoin in segwit-outputs. but I'm sure more than one bitcoin has been sent to a segwit tx and then the person died or forgot their keys or whatever, so I'd say it is impossible without essentially stealing/destroying ownership
[22:04:07] <AndyS2> earnestly: guess they fooled me :D
[22:05:14] <AndyS2> stealing/destroying ownership of bitcoin is probably not something the majority would want to do, and even if they did, the real chain would most likely continue on
[22:07:56] <bitcoins> Is segwit Bitcoin? I see segwit as an attack on Bitcoin. Why we just keep using the original address format and signatures? Up until 2140 there will be 50 different address formats or what is the plan?
[22:09:39] <AndyS2> Well, you see, that's the beauty of it: There's a version field, so it'll all be nice and tidy now, unlike before

[22:20:32] <bitcoins> "Bitcoin isn't something you want a single person to do all the work on"
[22:20:42] <AndyS2> AFAIK lightning could have been done without segwit, it would just have been a bit harder. So even if segwit had never happened, some people might have done something like lightning anyway, and nobody could have really stopped them
[22:21:33] <bitcoins> I see. So they pushed segwit to later implement lightning?
[22:22:28] <AndyS2> the community, miners and coders wanted to make bitcoin better, so they implemented and activated segwit. segwit made lightning easier and safer to implement AFAIK
[22:23:00] <bitcoins> :/
[22:24:08] <bitcoins> Interesting discussion.

[22:28:01] <AndyS2> Sounds like FUD and not how this works. How'd you even pay volunteers who have thousands of bitcoin to do something they don't agree with?
[22:28:17] <bitcoins> Is the profit Blockstream made are given back to the community or they just love to fill they pockets?
[22:29:20] <bitcoins> Peter Wuille co-funded Blockstream isnt he?
[22:29:35] <AndyS2> In any case you might get away with this in a closed source, non-oss non-free software project, but not something out in the open like Bitcoin, where there's so many passionate people not afraid to voice their own opinion.

[22:35:05] <bitcoins> So all in all, we cant do anything to get rid of segwit ever? It will stay with us forever? I just dont understand why they not created a fork and distributed that instead of polluting the main repository in an irreversible way
[22:36:08] <kinlo> bitcoins: there are enough forks without segwit.  There are plenty of reasons why bitcoin needs segwit...

[22:37:12] <AndyS2> I mean, it's probably a good idea to look at the code at this point. You might learn that the code reads quite nicely and why segwit is probably the update that made the code much nicer in general

[22:38:09] <bitcoins> Bitcoin doesnt require segwit, only blockstream products and patents, bitcoin was just fine without all of this
[22:39:28] <physiology> Guess I should read about segwit.
[22:39:29] <kinlo> bitcoins:  please stop with these unfounded statements, you're starting to anoy me. Bitcoin is open source and it's not owned or maintained by one company...
[22:39:44] <bitcoins> kinlo: so you telling me that discussions about non-segwit clients not allowed in the Bitxoin channel? Seems odd to me
[22:41:01] <kinlo> bitcoins: segwit is a part of bitcoin, non-segwit means a different protocol, hence not for this channel.  As I said, there are forks without segwit.  BitcoinCash was created for this reason, but that's offtopic for this channel
[22:43:39] *** Quits: yanmaani1 (~yanmaani@gateway/tor-sasl/yanmaani) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[22:43:43] <bitcoins> It is centralized unfortunately. Do you own the Bitcoin network to restrict talks about the original Bitcoin protocol? Feels like you try to erase Bitcoin's history by not allowing to talk about pre-segwit client like the ones released by Satoshi Nakamoto. No offense just really odd to see how you try to force segwit claiming that non-segwit
[22:43:43] <bitcoins> clients are "different protocols"
[22:44:17] *** Joins: yanmaani1 (~yanmaani@gateway/tor-sasl/yanmaani)
[22:44:43] <kinlo> it is a softfork, so you can still use pre-segwit clients, they will just miss out on a lot.  And last warning about making unfounded claims, bitcoin is not centralized

[22:48:11] <physiology> kinlo Is it okay to ask why he thinks it is centralized?  I'm still learning and thought that all Bitcoin traffic was decentralized by design.

[22:49:28] <kinlo> physiology: it is decentralized, he's just trolling here.
[22:49:45] <bitcoins> the development of Bitcoin is centralized on GitHub and those who has write access to the repository clearly paid by Blockstream which enforcing on is protocols which pollute the blockchain in an irreversible manner. I'm satoshi from the Bitcoin Forum https://bitcoin.forum . BitcoinCash is NOT Bitcoin that's for sure, nor "lightning" by Lightning
[22:49:46] <bitcoins> Labs Inc can be called Bitcoin, lightning never was and never will be bitcoin especially not off-chain. Lightning is like a big scam, some shitcoin. Have a great day

[23:09:26] <gene> we need community members searching for technical flaws in the protocol, as long as the motivation is to fix anything found, it only makes the protocol stronger
[23:09:27] <plank> oh boy i remember the UASF days
[23:09:32] <plank> exciting times
[23:09:41] <plank> they even made hats
[23:10:19] <plank> yeah and dont be afraid to report issues in dev channels
[23:10:35] <plank> just try and be helpful about it :)
[23:11:06] <berndj> so does the blockchain run into trouble in 2038 or only in 2106?
[23:11:11] <gene> the weird social attacks stengthen the community in a different way, and centralization under corporations is one such attack
[23:11:13] <physiology> Do I need the Bitcoin git if I have a wallet already?
[23:11:54] <plank> if you want to use bitcoin core instead of electrum, there are a number of ways to get it
[23:12:02] * gene not saying Blockstream centralizes Bitcoin, but it is a possibility
[23:12:15] <plank> can torrent it, get it from the website, install from source
[23:12:48] <plank> blockstream put a freaking bitcoin satellite into orbit
[23:12:50] <plank> thats just cool
[23:13:41] <gene> it is cool, but if (big if) Blockstream controlled (directly or indirectly) all meaningful development of the Bitcoin protocol, that would be a huge weakness/attack vector
[23:14:30] <berndj> i don't think "control" is the right verb
[23:15:07] <berndj> they can certainly influence bitcoin development, but they can't do things unilaterally (which i think would be needed to "control" it)
[23:16:04] <gene> what happens if such a large corporation was coerced by a government (or several), what if protocol changes were for the benefit of the large corporation to the detriment of everyone else? again, not saying Blockstream is such a corporation, nor is Bitcoin protocol dev centralized to that degree. it is an attack vector that needs to be protected against
[23:16:40] <sturles> More bitcoin devs work for Chaincode Labs than for Blockstream.
[23:17:42] <gene> it would be interesting to see a survey of the distribution of companies/individuals that make contributions to protocol development
[23:18:17] <gene> get some hard numbers to combat the FUD, gain insight into current level of decentralization
[23:19:37] <gene> softer metrics like alignment of goals despite separation of organization would be harder to measure (like how often Chaincode Labs and Blockstream are in agreement)
