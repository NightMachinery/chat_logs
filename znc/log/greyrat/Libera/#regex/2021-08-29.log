[10:44:54] <ChrisM> Can someone help me create a PHP script out of this? https://regex101.com/r/4omQco/35
[10:46:36] <ChrisM> It is more complicated than simply using the Code Generator because it uses Named Construct Groups with conditional logic like this highlighted in green in the substitution string...
[10:46:39] <ChrisM> ${abilityTarget:+ (${abilityTarget} Passive): (Passive)}
[10:48:38] <ChrisM> At the bottom of the Test string I copied the contents of the framework I have for the PHP script but I do not know how to generate the code that needs to go inside the return of the if and else statements
[10:49:56] <Me-me> We help with regex, if the pattern is valid, perhaps ask in a php channel.
[10:51:07] <ChrisM> I wish John was here, he is the one that helped me do this in the first place. But I had to edit and it the code no longer works.
[10:51:49] <Me-me> If people here help with something other than regex, you should take it as a kindness and not a guarantee. Don't rely on it.
[10:52:04] <purplex> yep requires PHP skill to be able to answer it
[10:52:08] *** Joins: I-M (~id@78.183.110.160)
[10:52:14] <ChrisM> K thanks
[10:53:13] <purplex> I have seen people asking python related questions too, luckily I know some python and I was to answer them but not php.
[10:53:26] <purplex> was able to*
[10:54:03] <ChrisM> I honestly do not care what I use all I want is something that will be able to perform these complex substitutions for me the same way that regex101 does
[10:54:46] <ChrisM> I am open to any solutions
[10:55:00] <purplex> It basically sounsds like you're saying code generator fails to convert to php?
[10:55:16] <ChrisM> No, it can conver to PHP in most cases
[10:55:30] <Me-me> No he's saying he wants additional code around the existing php that will also do whatever else.
[10:55:33] <purplex> ok then you want a customized script
[10:55:35] <ChrisM> But not when using Named Construct Groups with conditional logic
[10:57:08] <ChrisM> I honestly do not get why it has to be additional code, I don't get why the code generator cannot generate it all for me since it clearly knows what I want it to acheive because it shows me exactly the result I want in the bottom area that shows what it looks like after my substitution
[10:58:23] <ChrisM> I could copy all my code into regex101 a small chunk at a time and then paste the result back into my file but that would take forever
[10:59:53] <ChrisM> Sorry I am just getting really frustrated that I spend days working on getting a regex101 sandbox perfected and then end up not being able to do anything with it because it only works inside regex101
[11:01:12] <purplex> for now you can probably look that up in php tutorial about that syntax/rule and see if you can do it (that's what I usually do) until someone (john) takes a look.
[11:01:29] <Me-me> Let's not put an obligation on JohnDoe that he hasn't volunteered.
[11:01:33] <Me-me> That's how we got into this mess.
[11:02:17] <ChrisM> Yeah, he has no obligation.
[11:03:09] <ChrisM> How do you guys get it to save your Username in here? I have to choose a new one every time
[11:03:20] <Me-me> We're using our own clients.
[11:03:29] <ChrisM> Oh, I see
[11:03:39] <ChrisM> I just use the link on Regex101 =)
[11:05:13] <purplex> a method beyond just a regular client, we're on a cloud.

[16:49:08] <arash> is . means any character in PCRE2?
[16:49:33] <Me-me> Any character except "newline" characters - and it does include those if you use the "/s" modifier.
[16:50:49] <digitok> in every regex flavour, including pcre2
[16:52:00] <arash> so what is wrong with this one https://regex101.com/r/C2TF7q/1
[16:52:16] <digitok> what do you want it to do
[16:52:38] <arash> match all texts
[16:52:49] <digitok> https://regex101.com/r/C2TF7q/2
[16:53:19] <digitok> note the "s" flag on the right
[16:53:56] <arash> aha, i see. thank you
[16:54:07] <digitok> yw
[16:54:29] <digitok> turns out i have arash
[16:54:42] <digitok> definitely got it from Me-me
[17:11:06] <Timvde> digitok: I didn't know that syntax
[17:15:18] *** Joins: SlimmyJimmy (~Username@user/slimmyjimmy)
[17:16:44] <purplex> I learned from digitok as well 
[17:17:34] <SlimmyJimmy> So I thought the pipe (|) or is it called the logical or operator separated two expressions in one statement in essence saying get all strings that match the first expression or the second expression. Isn't that correct?
[17:17:55] <purplex> yep
[17:18:14] <SlimmyJimmy> Oh, I see what I did wrong, I used the square angle brackets and did not preface them with the backslash
[17:19:25] <arash> for matching user-agent in the log file, i used this regex, is it ok? any better regex? https://regex101.com/r/z453nO/1
[17:20:45] <purplex> Is that the entire test string? is there more after the user agent?
[17:21:32] <arash> purplex, its just one line, there are many lines just like this one, it is the access log file
[17:21:55] <arash> this is a sample
[17:22:01] <digitok> 07Timvde, yea, it's a cool feature. kinda sucks that php doesn't support it, despite being able to do it via callbacks
[17:22:31] *** Joins: d1cor (~diego@179.63.242.114)
[17:23:53] <digitok> 07arash, looks good
[17:24:06] <purplex> have you tried the regex on actual log file?
[17:24:37] <arash> purplex, not yet :D
[17:25:05] <purplex> likely won't work as expected if test string has more " or more text in line after agent
[17:25:09] <digitok> as long as the user agent is the only string preceded by " ", and there isn't anything else after it, it should be good
[17:27:18] <arash> its working fine, because i use regex in a foreach loop and each line in the log file is in a single array, so i use regex in a loop and its working this way.
[17:27:32] <purplex> So, regexes don't often work if rules are 'weak' e.g. based on " and you keep changing test strings. Always test using actual data, not part of it.
[17:27:58] <SlimmyJimmy> This is an interesting definition of Microsoft's version of regular expressions, is it right? "*        Repeat: zero or more occurrences of previous character or class"
[17:28:14] <digitok> yes
[17:28:38] <SlimmyJimmy> Okay, replacing the word previous with 'preceding' character wouldn't change the meaning would it?
[17:28:41] <purplex> or expression
[17:28:45] <digitok> nope
[17:28:51] <SlimmyJimmy> Thank You!
[17:29:18] <SlimmyJimmy> So, yes, for completeness, "the previous or preceding character or expression"
[17:29:21] <digitok> it doesn't mention group, but that applies too
[17:29:23] <arash> purplex, yes, you are right, actually that is the actual data, i forgot to mention i use a foreach loop
[17:30:20] <digitok> you could say "character, class, or group"
[17:30:22] <digitok> maybe

[17:33:50] <SlimmyJimmy> Ah, they show an asterisk but not the plus symbol, I'll try the asterisk

[17:35:53] <digitok> 10 things :)
[17:35:59] <ChrisM> Is it possible to get this working so it works regardless how many lines the if () { takes up? https://regex101.com/r/BQUR1D/3
[17:36:25] <SlimmyJimmy> Wow, and they pretend it supports regular expressions, it doesn't even support the or operator (|) from what I've tried.
[17:36:36] <digitok> nope, that's not listed
[17:36:47] <digitok> i mean it's still regular expressions :p
[17:36:53] <SlimmyJimmy> I guess I can list 2 strings, Ill try that
[17:38:00] <digitok> yea it says if you do a string search you can search for multiple words
[17:38:20] <digitok> probably won't work with regex enabled
[17:40:37] <SlimmyJimmy> I got it to work, you just put a space in the string for a second regular expression
[17:41:00] <digitok> right, so same as with a normal string
[17:41:46] <digitok> maybe you can use a literal space by escaping it with \
[17:43:06] <digitok> btw you can do more advanced regex using powershell :p
[17:46:43] <SlimmyJimmy> That's good to know, so I guess I wouldn't be using findstr then?
[17:46:53] <Me-me> ChrisM: Is this PCRE?
[17:47:01] <digitok> nope
[17:47:21] <ChrisM> Dunno what that is

[17:48:33] <digitok> he's also using php
[17:48:53] <ChrisM> Yeah when I have to
[17:48:59] <Me-me> Is there a reason you have all the (text|) instead of (text)?
[17:49:48] <ChrisM> Yeah to account for different variations
[17:50:35] <SlimmyJimmy> I'd like to find a way to find a target string in a huge text file and once that's found just say 'okay, found the section that I need, get the next 4 lines because it goes with the target string.
[17:50:55] <ChrisM> But all I need to know right now is how to be able to use the abilityNumber from inside an if statement that is any amount of lines
[17:50:55] <Me-me> ChrisM: I am referring to the instances of an alternative being empty.
[17:51:54] <ChrisM> Yeah because sometimes they have something in parencesis, sometimes they have a percentage with them and sometimes they have a 💯
[17:52:22] <Me-me> Right so those can be (text)? instead, then.

[17:57:43] <ChrisM> I was just explaining what my goal is
[17:58:56] <SlimmyJimmy> findstr is horrible at regular expressions

[18:00:44] <SlimmyJimmy> Works now
[18:04:36] <Me-me> Okhttps://regex101.com/r/BQUR1D/4 Alright I cleaned it up.
[18:05:16] <ChrisM> Thanks
[18:05:26] <Me-me> Now, you said any number of brackets, which I assume refers to what I have as the optional noncapture group in line 3. Is that accurate?
[18:06:14] <SlimmyJimmy> This findstr command literally only supports returning the entire line of data as well, I tried getting just the matched data to no avail.
[18:06:47] <ChrisM> Not any number of brackets. Any number of line breaks that the if (...........) can span
[18:07:02] <Me-me> Alright, so we'll take out that alternation entirely then.
[18:08:12] <Me-me> I think I see what you're going for. Let me see if I can whip something up.
[18:08:26] <ChrisM> Yay, thanks! I appreciate it.

[18:10:00] <SlimmyJimmy> On windows it's \r\n
[18:10:04] <digitok> right

[18:10:40] <digitok> lol
[18:11:02] <purplex> yep accident
[18:11:52] <purplex> you can't get the group 1 at all? maybe it requires different find function
[18:15:54] <Me-me> ChrisM: Okay so in the var PushRole line, what are you trying to extract?
[18:17:59] <ChrisM> Any number of words that may be followed by a percentage or may not and may end with a 💯 or may not
[18:18:51] <ChrisM> There will also sometimes be something in parenceses between the percentage and the 💯 but you dont need to account for that right now
