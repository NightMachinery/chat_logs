[03:26:31] <buster> (in other words it's annoying because i decided to make it annoying)
[03:27:42] <johnkeats6> is that to show the mobius bundle has no nowhere vanishing section?
[03:28:09] <Fangs> buster: excuse my use of sledge hammer, but isn't there a theorem about char classes or euler char or something that lets you know if such section exists?

[03:33:35] <Fangs> johnkeats6: wiki didnt mentioned orientability
[03:33:47] <Fangs> For example, a principal bundle has a global section if and only if it is trivial. On the other hand, a vector bundle always has a global section, namely the zero section. However, it only admits a nowhere vanishing section if its Euler class is zero.
[03:33:49] <johnkeats6> yes it did, that's how i remembered that

[03:38:46] <Fangs> buster: you may take discrete G
[03:39:04] <buster> cool cool.
[03:39:30] <johnkeats6> buster, if there is a nowhere vanishing section, normalize it. then that section + its negative will show the unit bundle (of vectors with unit norm) is 2 copies of the circle. but then building a paper mobius strip and working it out (or writing a specific map if you're boring) will show you the unit bundle of the mobius bundle is actually just 1 circle
[03:39:40] <johnkeats6> and we know 2 circles != 1 circle even without any algebraic topology

[03:59:14] <Fangs> buster: when G is discrete you take the discrete topology on G
[03:59:22] <buster> but you're talking about ... fundamental groups, covering spaces, deck transformations and so on?
[03:59:39] <buster> are there discrete Lie groups?
[04:00:04] <johnkeats6> any discrete group is a lie group, in a dumb way

[04:01:18] <Fangs> principal bundles are to me, a collection of U_i x G with U_i c R^n an open set, and a bunch of maps f_{i,j}: U_i x G -> U_j x G such that they satisfies the usual conditions
[04:01:19] <johnkeats6> R^0 = pt counts as euclidean space. any discrete space is locally homeomorphic to a point
[04:01:24] <johnkeats6> (that's the def of discrete)
[04:01:31] <Fangs> f_{i,j} needs to be cts/smooth
[04:01:35] <johnkeats6> so all discrete spaces are manifolds

[04:03:06] <buster> right right, the cocycle condition
[04:03:17] <Fangs> johnkeats6: I think we need paracompact base or something?

[04:04:35] <Fangs> buster: when a covering space has a universal covering space that's contractible, thats an example of a principal bundle (of the fundemental group)
[04:05:14] <Fangs> and any principal bundle over any space can be recovered up to homotopy as a map from that space to that space.. (ugh....)
[04:05:27] <Fangs> X a space with E universal covering space thats contractible
[04:06:09] <Fangs> and principal bundle of the fund group of X, say over any other space Y, is the pullbakk bundle of E through a map from f: X -> Y
[04:07:00] <Fangs> Y is called the classifying space of G (where G = pi(X))
[04:07:15] <Fangs> buster: I think for discrete groups this is how most classifying spaces are constructed

[09:02:54] <Fangs> johnkeats6: also do you know what the correct notion for tangent space is when talking about riemman surfaces?
[09:03:45] <Fangs> let X be a riemman surface, then TX is a tangent bundle where at everypoint its R^2, you can complexify this either by R^2 (x) C, this gives you C^2.. a 4-dimensional thing, or you can select a "J" compatible with orientation yada yada and J^2 = -I

[10:20:16] <Fangs> if space is hausdorff, they're all equal
[10:20:52] <PlanckWalk> If x doesn't have a compact neighbourhood, then every open set containing oo also contains x, I think.
[10:21:09] <Fangs> yeah
[10:21:48] <Fangs> open sets U around oo needs to have X - U be compact open iirc

[15:17:02] <rubiksdream> when you start working with conformal isomorphisms of CP^n for n >= 2, you are no longer looking at riemann surfaces , rather the holomorphic maps are holomorphic of several complex variables

[15:26:47] <HisShadow> Hercules: the "guessing of a solution" as y = e^(l t) can be averted by using laplace transform, also what is r1 and r2 in your answer?
[15:27:19] *** Joins: cvmn (~caveman@gateway/tor-sasl/caveman)
[15:27:22] <Hercules> HisShadow, r1 and r2 are the roots of the characteristic equation
[15:27:38] <cherim> The general solution is c1 e^(-x) + c2 e^(0*x) here
[15:27:55] <Hercules> since the characteristic equation here `b2 - 4ac < 0` it will give imaginary roots
[15:28:12] <Hercules> Sorry I meant y'' + y = 0
[15:28:22] <Hercules> I just saw it.

[16:49:11] <Z-module> It sould be   iff  lim_{x -> c} f|J  exists...
[16:49:43] <Z-module> sorry,   f|J f(x)      that is,  lim_{x -> c} g(x)   where g is the restriction of f to J
[16:50:49] <Z-module> f's domain could be I, does not need to be I \ {c}
[16:51:00] <Z-module> either way works
[16:51:51] <passstab> Z-module: that is how it is stated regarding {c}.
[16:51:59] <Z-module> that's fine

[16:52:27] <Z-module> the point is that f's value at c, or even its existence at c, aren't relelvant concerning the existence or value of this limit
[16:52:31] <passstab> the second f has its top cut off in the textbook, so it could be a j.
[16:52:45] <Z-module> must be J
[16:52:56] <Z-module> otherwise the notation is nonsensical
[16:53:18] <Z-module>   f|B   is the notation for f restricted to B, where B is some subset of f's domain
[16:53:41] <Z-module> (well, they're being sloppy here about the case of c possiby being in J )
[16:53:57] <Z-module> (oh, it *is* in J)
[16:54:34] <Z-module> you can't restrict a function to something that's not a subset of the original domain, but the point is, no matter how f is defined at c, or even if it's not, the limit is meaningful'
[16:55:01] <passstab> Z-module: Thank you, that was very helpful.

[19:35:06] <bleb> i had a question too... is there a name for cuberoot(x^3 + y^3 + ...)

[19:35:56] <female_student_4> Okay, no idea what the question wants so, Ill do both
[19:35:58] <female_student_4> Thanks
[19:36:51] <HisShadow> bleb: those are all metrics, except for odd power you need to encase each coordinate in absolute value

[19:37:50] <bleb> ok
[19:38:18] <bleb> im comparing vectors with discrete values {1,0,-1} for each dimension
[19:38:51] <bleb> and i want the difference between 1 and -1 to be treated as much bigger than the difference between 1 and 0, or 0 and -1
[19:39:13] <bleb> does a higher order norm seem like a good tool for that?
[19:39:46] <qergle> HeXVeX: i would consider 4 major classes and then count how many in each class.
[19:40:28] <HisShadow> bleb: no, all -1s will be turned into 1s
[19:40:48] <bleb> yeah
[19:41:37] <bleb> guess I want e.g. quarticroot((x1-x0)^4 + (y1-y0)^4 + ...)

[19:42:39] <HeXVeX> @qergle I assume you're referring to splitting the board into 4 and using symmetry to cut down the number of cases, and then counting the possible cases for each of the 4 king positions?
[19:42:58] <bleb> actually that doesn't do what i want... [1] would still be 2 from [-1]
[19:43:08] <bleb> maybe if i just omit the quarticroot
[19:43:23] <qergle> HeXVeX: no, hadn't gotten to symmetry yet
[19:43:23] <HeXVeX> @bleb - Why would the euclidean metric be an issue in this case?  Wouldn't it give you the desired ordering?
[19:43:28] <bleb> or use squares and omit the square root
[19:44:17] <bleb> HeXVeX: i'm using the vectors to represent answers to questions, and active disagreement should be treated much more strongly than participation vs abstention
[19:44:17] <qergle> HeXVeX: case 1, put the black king on the back rank (row 8) and then white king in any of 3 (2) squares in direct opposition on 6th row or to left/right, then queen on 7th right next

[19:44:44] <qergle> so bk on e8, wk on e6 and wq on e7 (as an example)
[19:44:52] <bleb> HeXVeX: so I want the numerical values of the distance between 1 and -1 to be greater and 1 to 0 and 0 to -1
[19:45:04] <qergle> in this position you can vary the white king to d6 and f6 (same mate)
[19:45:41] <qergle> so you count the possibilities as black king goes from a8 to h8. then multiply by 4 to get all 4 sides. that's one "type"
[19:46:50] <HeXVeX> @qergle That makes good sense; I'll give that a try and see what I end up with (much nicer than trying to code it!)
[19:47:28] <HeXVeX> @bleb Why not just foregoe the square root in the euclidean metric (so just sum the squares of differences)
[19:47:41] <HeXVeX> -1 1 would give you 4, where as 0 1 would give you 1.

[19:56:01] <qergle> maybe it's best in that "type" to consider bk from b8 to g8 and treat the 4 corners separately.
[19:56:18] <qergle> ie bk on a8,h8,a1,h1

[19:58:59] <qergle> now, i did this quickly, but for that type (lone king on back rank) and white queen next to it with white king supporting the queen, i got 88 positions.
[19:59:13] <cherim> (Advice from a person who solved 4000+ competitive programmin problems)

[20:01:01] <qergle> next "type" would be black king on edge and white king in opposition (eg bk on e8 and wk on e6) with white queen on back rank mate (somewhere on 8th rank except d8 or f8)

[22:30:39] <female_student_4> I think I'll just do it the basic way but thanks
[22:30:52] <dk657> female_student_4: what's the basic way?
[22:31:19] <female_student_4> just like summation operator then log ( pi^y * (1-pi)^1-yi]
[22:31:23] <female_student_4> And then just be like
[22:31:28] <female_student_4> let c represent terms which do not involve pi
[22:31:32] <female_student_4> and then use basic laws of logs
[22:31:52] <int-e> sedeki: E[-2 E[Y|X] E[Y]] = -2E[Y] E[E[Y|X]], and E[E[Y|X]] = E[Y]
[22:32:28] <sedeki> yeah, thanks
[22:33:22] <sedeki> the expectation operator is only applied to X in the inner ones
[22:33:52] <int-e> I think it's E_X[E_{Y|X}[Y|X]] = E_{X,Y}[Y] = E_Y[Y] ?

[23:14:35] <Simplar> Who is good here at probability theory?
[23:15:10] <dk657> x_i and x_i are independent???
[23:15:45] <female_student_4> So imagine points of two different groups
[23:15:49] <female_student_4> on a scatterplot
[23:16:38] <dk657> oh, x_i is a mixture of two normals, and the x_i, i = 1, ..., N are independent
[23:18:54] <female_student_4> Would you know how to differentiate with respect to pi tho
[23:18:55] <female_student_4> ?
[23:19:34] <dk657> female_student_4: yes, pretend c and the y_i are constant, and take the derivative wrt pi
[23:20:04] <female_student_4> What would that look like tho?
[23:20:22] <dk657> you'll get \sum y_i/pi - (1-y_i)/(1-pi) or something like that

[23:23:22] <Simplar> I have a probability theory task that might interest you.
[23:25:21] <munkis> Am I correct that the probability of getting a full spread when rolling x x sided fair dice is x!/x↑↑2
[23:25:36] <female_student_4> dk657 The sum of (1-y) disappears though which is weird
[23:26:29] <qergle> is x↑↑2 = x^x?
[23:26:32] <dk657> female_student_4: have you tried writing it all out?
[23:26:50] <Simplar> Ten reporters take part in a global conference. Each reporter has its own presentation. A viewer has two choices of equal probability before each presentation: to skip it or to attend it. What is the minimal amount of attendees required for the possibility of the following event: Two or more attendees that skipped the same presentations attended the last presentation.
[23:26:55] <qergle> i forget knuth's notation
[23:27:02] <munkis> yes.
[23:27:08] <female_student_4> dk657 yes I can see the answer now but the summation of 1-y disappears
