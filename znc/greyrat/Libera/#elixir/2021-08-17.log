[12:48:29] <serafeim> i'd like to talk about the phoenix 1.6. the esbuild seems like a great tool
[12:48:59] <serafeim> i think that it's the first time that I see a javascript tool that is really great. 
[13:02:07] <rawtaz> what is it you like about it thats different from previous tooling?
[13:09:03] <serafeim> rawtaz: it's not node.js based for starters
[13:09:29] <serafeim> also it is fast.
[13:09:31] <serafeim> hmmm now
[13:09:53] <serafeim> it is not fast. it's speed is normal. the fact that the node.js tooling is so slow makes it fast though
[13:10:06] <serafeim> it does not need any configuration
[13:10:09] <serafeim> it just works
[13:10:23] <serafeim> you don't need to learn a new DSL just to use it
[13:10:41] <serafeim> try it and you'll be amazed
[13:11:09] <serafeim> of course my opinion is still that the phoenix framework shouldn't have *any* dependencies and just ship vanilla js. but that's the next best thing
[13:12:26] <Nicd> dunno about the support for script type="module" in browsers but the bigger problem is that there's too many files to load -> big latency

[13:27:48] *** Quits: srfsh (~srfsh@user/srfsh) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[13:28:07] <serafeim> Nicd: the thing is that all these are not really needed. just put the vanilla.js bundle file in the version control
[13:28:47] <serafeim> so when i create a new phoenix project i'll just have this vanilla.js file without the need to install *any* extra tools. what tools are used for development of the js bundle are not my concern
[13:29:07] <Nicd> bundling a single file isn't really helpful for frontend development
[13:29:48] <serafeim> Nicd: if somebody would like to do frontend development he'd have th option to modify the source and use bundling tools to create his file
[13:30:00] <Nicd> in the vast majority of cases you want JS tooling since you will be writing JS. people would start asking "why do I need to do more work to get Phoenix up and running"
[13:30:08] <serafeim> but if i don't care about writing any JS or if writing JS in the template is good enough for me why force me to install this crap ?
[13:30:32] <Nicd> they're not forcing it, you can use `--no-assets` to skip it
[13:30:34] <serafeim> Nicd: actually no. the work would be much less because there wouldn't be any js tools
[13:30:46] <serafeim> Nicd: ha ha ha yes but i am missing functionality this way
[13:30:51] <serafeim> i need to copy over things manually
[13:30:52] <Nicd> you assume people don't use JS tools
[13:30:58] <Nicd> that's where you're wrong
[13:31:00] <serafeim> Nicd: well i don't
[13:31:07] <serafeim> Nicd: i hate them with all my heart
[13:31:26] <serafeim> i prefer to stick hot needles in my eyes that to use any node.js tooling
[13:32:05] <Nicd> the _overwhelming_ majority of devs will need the typical tools like esbuild or webpack to work with the frontend JS. Phoenix is optimising for this most common case. those that don't want the tools can use `--no-assets` and just write JS in the priv folder themselves
[13:33:01] *** Joins: srfsh (~srfsh@user/srfsh)
[13:35:54] <rawtaz> serafeim: is it the "[mix phx.new] Remove usage of Sass" change youre talking about? or what is it that phoenix does now that was previously done by some js tool?
[13:36:59] <Nicd> rawtaz: webpack being replaced with esbuild
[13:37:25] <rawtaz> hm thats not mentioned in https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md
[13:38:03] <rawtaz> i guess it will be at some point :)
[13:39:19] <Nicd> you can see how it will look: https://github.com/josevalim/phx_esbuild_demo
[13:39:46] <Nicd> there's a new package `:esbuild` in hex that will download a prebuilt esbuild binary for you

[13:43:28] <rawtaz> does that run the js esbuild externally?
[13:44:28] <Nicd> it does: https://github.com/josevalim/phx_esbuild_demo/blob/master/config/config.exs#L33
[13:44:32] <serafeim> hmm interesting 
[13:50:38] <serafeim> no it is replaced by esbuild in 1.6. that's final
[13:50:44] <serafeim> and as i said that's a good first step

[20:30:23] <linusmarton[m]> I have been off from Elixir for a couple of years (before contexts etc in Phoenix) but trying to get back into it now and have a question. Has there been any “consensus” about where to put business logic I Phoenix? Like… lets say I have a Lock schema. In my Rails app I have a Lock model and I can call Lock.unlock and it makes an http call to a device which unlocks it. Where would be appropriate to put this? It doesn’t make sense
[20:30:23] <linusmarton[m]> in the schema file I guess. What about some context?
[20:31:22] <linusmarton[m]> Of course it depends… but are there some general advice?

[20:59:37] <linusmarton[m]> Also… are there any bigger opensource Phoenix projects out there which uses contexts etc beyond the Accounts/User example which is everywhere? :)

[22:35:52] <nickjj> linusmarton[m], most of the bigger open source sites like hex and changelog don't use contexts in the way they're described in the documentation
[22:37:14] <ericmj> hexpm pretty much does
[22:38:22] <nickjj> plausible analytics would also be classified as not like the docs but it implements them in a "pretty much" style
[22:38:57] <ericmj> can you elaborate on the difference?
[22:39:12] <nickjj> it's mainly where files are located
[22:39:51] <nickjj> like having a lib/hello/accounts.ex file with a lib/hello/accounts/*.ex directory of schemas
[22:41:02] <nickjj> unless the hex site got a really big refactor i remember you guys having your context modules next to your schemas and other files related to that specific context

[22:42:35] <ericmj> hexpm does a slightly coarser grouping of directories, but that’s a minute detail
[22:42:36] *** LostKobrakai is now known as LostKobrakai[awa
[22:42:51] <ericmj> It doesn’t affect anything in practice

[22:43:43] <ericmj> hexpm just puts more contexts in each directory
[22:45:27] <nickjj> yeah it's not a big deal in the end, but if you're just getting into contexts, it is 1 thing to think about when looking at open source projects
[22:45:51] <nickjj> "hey this doesn't match the docs, i wonder why", stuff like that
