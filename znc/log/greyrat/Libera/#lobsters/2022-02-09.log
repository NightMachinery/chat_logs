[02:04:12] <Rayyan> never heard good things about mediatek :P
[02:05:04] <Rayyan> are there even any mt socs in mainline?
[02:05:24] <Ristovski> There are, mainly due to Chromebooks using some mtk socs iirc
[02:05:39] <Rayyan> ah
[02:06:23] <Ristovski> I should gather up the strength and write a proper article about mtk socs, would be lots of work but /really worth it/, especially since there are aren't any good centralized resources for low-level mtk stuff

[02:08:55] <Rayyan> is there a reason why most phone SoC mainlining is qcom?

[02:11:21] <Ristovski> oops
[02:11:28] <Ristovski> MTK very rarely releases kernel sources*
[02:12:22] <Ristovski> While Qualcomm has an excellent record for releasing upstream kernels (aka only for the SoC itself) to which OEMs add their device-specific drivers and "usually" release as open source as well (Motorola does this for example)

[02:13:23] <Ristovski> I wish they cared about that D:
[02:13:40] <Ristovski> they simple don't give a crap
[02:14:20] <Ristovski> also code quality is usually much worse on mtk :)
[02:16:29] <Ristovski> So, you know how most Android devices are a brick when stolen since they have "Factory Reset Protection" where you need to login as the original owner in order to do it. On mediatek, you can use SP Flash Tool to erase the "frp" partition and that's it! Almost no OEM uses the mtk "security features" that are supposed to prevent the use of SP Flash Tool and other similar tools
[02:18:05] <Rayyan> lol
[02:18:06] <Ristovski> Qualcomm on the other hand has actual security that is seemingly impossible to bypass, mainly because they employ actual complex solutions. While on mediatek you can dump the preloader, patch it to disable verification and then you "pwn" the rest of the boot flow since even the Trust Zone(!!) trusts that the preloader is "secure"
[02:18:34] <Rayyan> <Ristovski> they simple don't give a crap
[02:18:56] <Ristovski> I assume you can technically even dump trust zone keys (free widevine DRM keys :D) if you try hard enough
[02:19:06] <Rayyan> how have they not yet been forced to give us it?
[02:20:05] <Ristovski> I have no clue, I've heard of someone pressuring them to give GPL sources _successfully_ maybe like twice

[12:08:46] <summonner> enterprisey, it's also a glimpse into how their company works. if it takes ages to get a contract to you, and they obviously need another person, imagine how long it would take to get a chair approved? or a new computer?

[12:45:53] <gthm> I got a contract from a place in late December, they still haven't figured out how to get an online signing thing to work so we're just twiddling our thumbs while I print the thing out in the background and just do it old school

[13:07:19] <albertito> enterprisey: I do agree, it's not properly final until you both signed. But if you want to wait and see, it's fine too, just be aware the chances of the agreement breaking up is higher until they signed

[18:46:42] <JordiGH> I still feel that, fundamentally, nobody understands git.
[18:46:54] <iDrougge> I think that's mostly Git's own fault.

[19:08:18] <JordiGH> Brekkjern: Hey, I think I can make two strings shorter (and thus have less font width) without kerning!

[19:13:03] <wink> which could suck if you for some reason align your if x == b checks
[19:13:19] <wink> or are they double width? I think not
[19:13:39] <bkhl> iDrougge, I don't like them, always seems to lead to false positives. I much prefer the approach of prettify-mode in Emacs.
[19:13:48] <iDrougge> 🤷
[19:14:21] <iDrougge> I was discussing JordiGH's quote about two strings joined not being the width of the two strings combined.
[19:14:43] <iDrougge> Personally, it just makes me sad that we use digraphs in the year of the Lord 2022.
[19:15:01] <bkhl> Those programming fonts tend to have the ligature be the length of the "real" characters.
[19:15:09] <bkhl> So that they won't mess with alignments.
[19:15:09] <gerikson> yeah
[19:15:25] <companion_cube> digraphs?
[19:15:26] <wink> bkhl: thanks. I have never checked.
[19:15:31] <bkhl> Which is what I do too with prettify mode, except I have it replace them with an actual double-width character
[19:15:33] <companion_cube> (the thing removed from C++?)
[19:15:43] <wink> no tht were trigraphs
[19:15:50] <companion_cube> ah right!
[19:15:53] <wink> I think '==' is being called a digraph here
[19:16:00] <wink> or >= or !=
[19:16:16] <bkhl> Actually the "ph" in digraph is a digraph.
[19:16:27] <iDrougge> 😂
[19:16:51] <wink> isnt' that just a diphtong?
[19:16:59] <bkhl> No.
[19:17:04] <iDrougge> No, a diphtong is two vowels pronounced in the space of one.
[19:17:09] <bkhl> diphtongs are a type of vowel, has nothing to do with their spelling
[19:17:21] <wink> wait, is it really only vowels? meh
[19:17:22] <bkhl> "I" in English is a diphtong.
[19:17:34] <wink> it's  been 20 years.how would I remember
[19:17:43] <Brekkjern> This is like the linguistics version of the difference between a codepoint and a sequence of bytes :P
[19:18:08] <bkhl> In linguistics the difference between ortography and pronunciation is a lot more important.
[19:18:20] <bkhl> A diphtong is more a matter of pronunciation than spelling/ortography.
[19:18:54] <Brekkjern> I dunno, but the confusion seems similar :P
[19:18:55] <wink> oh, I'm pretty sure I know why I mixed it up
[19:19:04] <iDrougge> Because both begin with "di".
[19:19:06] <bkhl> I don't really mind the transferred meaning of "digraph" here.
[19:19:21] <bkhl> It just means "two graphs" in Greek or whatever, so quite applicable.
[19:19:21] <wink> Diphtong in German is alos called Doppelvokal. and there's Doppelkonsonant, which doesn't seem to have a real English version
[19:19:29] <wink> so I reverese-reasoned, wrongfully
[19:19:40] <bkhl> Whereas the "thong" in dipthong means sound, so has nothing to do with spelling.
[19:20:02] <iDrougge> The typographic equivalent of a diphton is a monogramme.
[19:20:07] <bkhl> Or I guess "pthong"
[19:20:44] <jmiven> the posix thongs
[19:21:10] <wink> the German wikipedia article for 'th' does not have any word (verbatim or translation) of digraph, the English one has
[19:21:26] <wink> and I never heard Digraph in any grammar lesson, I only know it from parsers and CS
[19:21:33] <wink> so maybe our terminology is just bad.
[19:21:34] <bkhl> It's not a grammatical concept, so that seems fine. :-)
[19:21:35] <iDrougge> Same here.
[19:21:41] <wink> or my teachers were a little sloppy
[19:22:46] <wink> wait, I just didnt look properly on the article. aaanyway

[22:13:52] <iDrougge> JordiGH: They're called "mice".
[22:14:11] <JordiGH> Ah, magic mouse.
[22:14:16] <JordiGH> I got a magic keyboard.
[22:14:22] <JordiGH> But apparently a regular ol' mouse for a mouse??
[22:14:33] <JordiGH> I didn't order a mouse. Did one of you send me a magic mouse?

[22:15:19] <defect> i do the same. i have a magic keyboard and an old as hell logitech mx900 bluetooth mouse that runs out of battery in like three days
[22:15:43] <JordiGH> Hm, what's the wireless protocol that those USB mice-with-dongle use?
[22:15:51] <JordiGH> Is it RF?
[22:16:05] <JordiGH> I mean, not protocol, what kind of electromagnetic waves?
[22:16:11] <af> 2.4ghz radio
[22:16:12] <iDrougge> It's usually a 2,4 GHz transmission.
[22:16:19] <iDrougge> Like bluetooth without the licensing.
[22:16:42] <JordiGH> And without the pairing nonsense.
[22:16:48] <JordiGH> Here's a physical device, pair with that.
[22:16:52] <JordiGH> And only that.
[22:16:53] <JordiGH> Done.
[22:17:27] <af> I wish more wireless devices worked like that
[22:17:36] <JordiGH> I wonder what the Bluetooth protocol looks like.

[22:18:21] <JordiGH> idk what's your provenance?
[22:19:26] <iDrougge> Oh yes, the pairing nonsense. I certainly don't have that with this bag of mice that have lost their dongle.
[22:19:35] <af> Doesn't bluetooth have separate data transfer mode altogether for audio?
[22:20:30] <iDrougge> There are a dozen BT profiles for audio.
[22:22:12] <af> well it does work well

[22:25:09] <bsandro> JordiGH: that abysmal thing can barely be considered a mouse
[22:25:49] <bsandro> i have no idea how they came up with charging port being on the bottom of the mouse
[22:26:02] *** Joins: vicfred (~vicfred@user/vicfred)
[22:26:32] <bsandro> i got that mouse with imac; once battery ran out I didn't charge it out of spite and just got back to proper trackball
[22:27:59] <JordiGH> Did you ever use the hockey puck?
[22:28:40] <iDrougge> I remember a colleague who got a brand new PowerMac G3 to replace his old computer but refused using it until he got a replacement for the puck mouse.
[22:28:41] <bsandro> no, saw photos though, "funny" design
[22:29:05] <iDrougge> I have a Magic Trackpad II both at work and at home, it is a wonderful pointing device.
[22:29:09] <bsandro> at least you can use it continuously
[22:29:19] <JordiGH> What were they thinking with the hockey puck?
[22:29:30] <iDrougge> Looks good on photos.
[22:30:23] *** mahmutov_ is now known as mahmutov
[22:30:34] <JordiGH> Do Apple laptops have a headphone jack or would that be too cowardly?
[22:30:40] <bsandro> they do
[22:30:48] <JordiGH> Phew.
[22:31:12] <JordiGH> This laptop should arrive around February 24, I'm scared.
[22:31:20] <bsandro> I think it still doubles as optical spdif
[22:31:49] <JordiGH> I'm hoping I'll just have to use the Apple laptop to log into their corporate intranet and I can still do normal work on a normal computer.
[22:31:51] <drobilla> Last I checked they have one on the wrong side now?
[22:31:55] <iDrougge> bsandro: I think it doesn't.
[22:32:08] <iDrougge> drobilla: True.
[22:32:16] <bsandro> cheapskates
[22:32:19] <JordiGH> I mean, my code's gonna go on github and it's "just" Node. Surely that can be done without an Apple laptop?
[22:32:37] <JordiGH> And they run Docker. Which seems so nutty to me on Apple OS.
[22:32:43] <JordiGH> Isn't that a Linux VM anyway?
[22:32:45] <bsandro> is it an m1 laptop?

[22:33:36] <JordiGH> bsandro: "14-inch MacBook Pro - Silver"
[22:33:45] <bsandro> JordiGH: no year?
[22:33:45] <iDrougge> JordiGH: So something like a PDP-11?
[22:33:49] <JordiGH> Is Silver the colour or some secret designation for how cool it is?
[22:33:53] <iDrougge> Or a VAX 11/780?
[22:34:00] <JordiGH> iDrougge: Sadly, no, I don't think GNU ever worked on that.
[22:35:31] <technomancy> JordiGH: if they don't let you work on foss on your own hardware that'd be pretty weird. plus how would they know?

[22:36:39] <bsandro> technomancy: enjoyed that last article of yours, thanks!
[22:36:53] <bsandro> JordiGH: tis a very nice hardware
[22:37:00] <JordiGH> technomancy: I think they intend to install corporate surveillance software? At least I signed papers saying I was okay with them doing so.
[22:37:08] <iDrougge> Haha.
[22:37:13] <JordiGH> bsandro: I disagree, no right ctrl key.
[22:37:20] <technomancy> bsandro: thanks!
[22:37:36] <technomancy> JordiGH: but there's no spyware on your personal one
[22:37:51] <JordiGH> technomancy: Yeah, maybe they wanna spy on how many hours I've got Emacs open?
[22:37:53] <bsandro> ..allegedly
[22:38:21] <bsandro> i realized it is virtually impossible to trust any modern hardware anymore
[22:38:45] <JordiGH> Not sure how they'd install it since it seems I'm getting the laptop shipped straight from Apple. Maybe my first day is, okay, download this thing and input this key so we know how to track you.
[22:39:43] <iDrougge> It's funny when someone models his whole professional life around the non-standard anachronistic keyboard commands of an editor that was written for an entire different keyboard.
[22:39:52] <JordiGH> It's weird, what's that Google security thing where you trust devices, not users? Everyone at Google has a Google-assigned hardware controlled by Google with software installed by Google and that's how you authenticate people to your network? So you track devices and not user credentials.
[22:40:25] <JordiGH> iDrougge: You should rename yourself to macDrougge, your corporate branding is also anachronistic.
[22:41:19] <iDrougge> It is, but it is also meant to be humourous.
[22:41:37] <iDrougge> Besides, aren't the stationary ones still called iMac?
[22:41:47] <JordiGH> Oh, you would know. Sorry.
