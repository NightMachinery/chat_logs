[01:13:10] <Berlin36> welp
[01:13:33] <Berlin36> its okay ;-;
[01:14:10] <emmeka> Berlin36 my favourite thing about Lain is that its producer wanted to create something that was explicitly Japanese and would be unintelligible to Americans, when he learned that the series was financially successful overseas, he said he was very disappointed in himself
[01:14:30] <Berlin36> :/
[01:14:59] <Berlin36> i don't understand some parts because the dub didn't translate the text on some papers or walls or whatever
[01:17:28] <emmeka> the dub of Lain isn't particularly good and I wouldn't recommend it.
[01:17:42] <emmeka> dubs of that era rarely are.

[14:34:18] <emmeka> deists are basically just people who conclude that god must rationally exist, as determined by reason and science, but that all the scriptures are obviously fake
[14:34:36] <zoidberg> "Deism is the philosophical position and rationalistic theology that rejects revelation as a source of divine knowledge, and asserts that empirical reason and observation of the natural world are exclusively logical, reliable, and sufficient to determine the existence of a Supreme Being as the creator of the universe."

[17:32:46] <Sadale> Bco1981, hah no. no nut's more fun than non-stop
[17:32:57] <Sadale> And it's far more challenging than non-stop :3
[17:33:05] <Bco1981> are you sure...

[17:33:29] <Bco1981> pain in cumin'
[17:33:46] <Sadale> As I often cum once a week, no nut november would only be 4 times the suffering. It's fine :D
[17:33:55] <Sadale> as for if it's actually fine tho, time will tell.
[17:33:57] <Sadale> YOLO

[17:35:32] * Sadale wonders if his 40yo retirement plan would actually work out
[17:36:01] <Sadale> Hopefully I could escape from this stupid capitalism game sooner rather than later
[17:36:04] *** Quits: mei (~mei@user/mei) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[17:36:19] <Bco1981> if your expenses are low enough, and you have enough money, should be possible.
[17:36:41] <Sadale> yep. There're very many variables tho.
[17:36:56] <ezekielnoob> Sadale we have the same goal
[17:37:03] <ezekielnoob> i have 10 years left before 40
[17:37:07] <ezekielnoob> i don't think i can do it
[17:37:07] <Sadale> inflation rate of the retirement destination. visa/immigration policy changes. investment return.
[17:37:08] <ezekielnoob> haha
[17:37:22] <ezekielnoob> but i made some major investments this year
[17:37:24] <Sadale> oh. And of course, my salary
[17:37:29] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, good luck anyhow :3
[17:37:39] <ezekielnoob> actually not really retire by 40
[17:37:44] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, and you're lucky to have a remote webdev job there in PH.
[17:37:47] <ezekielnoob> but i want maybe a business with my hobby
[17:37:52] <ezekielnoob> i want to build like a themed studio
[17:37:55] <ezekielnoob> yeah
[17:38:08] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, I see. I don't really want to conduct business. I just want to make whatever I want to make.
[17:38:08] <ezekielnoob> i make like X5 of what i probably would be making here
[17:38:37] <Sadale> Maybe electronics. Maybe music. Maybe games. I really dunno. The thing is that it requires time to do this kind of stuffs.
[17:38:51] <Sadale> And even if I'm not making anything I'd rather to watch anime over working 9-to-5
[17:39:00] <ezekielnoob> i see
[17:39:06] <ezekielnoob> yeah retiring by 40 is uncommon
[17:39:09] <Sadale> fuck capitalism :P
[17:39:12] <ezekielnoob> but it's a good goal
[17:39:21] <ezekielnoob> cause retiring by 60.. im kinda too weak to have fun by that point
[17:39:22] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, Nanobot, if succeed, will retire at 53.
[17:39:28] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, Nanobot, if succeed, will retire at 535*
[17:39:31] <Sadale> 35**
[17:39:45] <ezekielnoob> don't get kids yet
[17:39:54] <ezekielnoob> that ruins your plan :p
[17:39:56] <Sadale> And Nanobot's approaching the goal, so long the BTC price keep rising enough for him to make his final sell.
[17:40:06] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, I don't even have a wife. :p
[17:40:14] <ezekielnoob> i remember nanobot was mining BTC back in 2013
[17:40:15] <Sadale> And yes, I won't have one any time soon because it'll ruin my plan
[17:40:39] <Sadale> Lumiri's investing into shit. She's making great return and she aims to retire at 35 as well.
[17:41:03] <ezekielnoob> and it's not like you're trying to live extravagantly
[17:41:09] <Sadale> me tho. 40yo. Yes, it's a bit agressive. But it may work out with some luck. If not, maybe 45 still wouldn't be too bad. :p
[17:41:26] <Sadale> yep. The opposite. I'm just trying to come up with ways to conserve money
[17:41:34] <ezekielnoob> i think everyone regrets not buying BTC :D

[17:42:10] <Sadale> be careful tho. BTC's very volatile.
[17:42:42] <ezekielnoob> even if it is, it trends upwards Sadale overtime
[17:42:44] <Sadale> At least make sure that you won't be homeless. Anyway it goes with any kind of investment
[17:42:46] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, true
[17:42:50] <ezekielnoob> i udnerstand it still has a way of going down 90% lol
[17:42:53] <ezekielnoob> but i am prepared
[17:42:58] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, nice :3
[17:43:02] <ezekielnoob> you can wipe out my investmebnts and i would still be able to recover
[17:43:05] <ezekielnoob> im gonna cry tho
[17:43:10] <Sadale> lol
[17:43:14] <ezekielnoob> but i can afford what im putting
[17:43:18] <ezekielnoob> i wish i was 1 year early
[17:43:22] <Sadale> If it's gonna rise again tho, that wouldn't be a problem.
[17:43:40] <Sadale> I'm not so sure about BTC. But for the stock market I believe that it'd just be a matter of time for it to recover
[17:43:40] <ezekielnoob> i got in BTC back in May
[17:43:46] <ezekielnoob> which is the worst time this year haha
[17:43:53] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, congratz :3
[17:44:04] <ezekielnoob> i saw my money go down -60%
[17:44:11] <Sadale> As for BTC I'm a bit worried about policies from the government tho.
[17:44:25] <ezekielnoob> i feel like it just makes sense for crypto for the future
[17:44:31] <ezekielnoob> maybe it's not BTC as the leader eventually
[17:44:33] <Sadale> The government could just ban BTC trading like any time. :/
[17:44:35] <ezekielnoob> because of it's nature
[17:45:06] <Sadale> It's something that the government couldn't quite regulate. So it may make sense for them to ban cryptocoins
[17:45:07] <Nanobot> ezekielnoob: I've never mined bitcoin

[17:45:29] <ezekielnoob> there's someone here that was mining
[17:45:37] <ezekielnoob> Nanobot awesome
[17:45:45] <ezekielnoob> i mean buying probably is more profitable than mining :D
[17:45:46] <spoonm> ezekielnoob: where is my wife?
[17:45:48] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, Not back in 2013. But I mined BTC back then. It wasn't profitable tho
[17:45:54] <ezekielnoob> spoonm oh gimme a sec

[17:49:46] <Sadale> zoidberg, I think not.
[17:49:55] <ezekielnoob> 1M USD is not good enough for me to retire tho
[17:50:00] <ezekielnoob> actually it should
[17:50:05] <Sadale> zoidberg, I'm not sure. Anyway I met Terminus and his gf in Hong Kong.
[17:50:08] <ezekielnoob> as long as i use the money smartly
[17:50:17] <Sadale> zoidberg, they were having a recreational trip here. :3
[17:50:28] <zoidberg> I see Sadale 
[17:50:36] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, lol 1M USD is like my retirement budget xD
[17:51:08] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, and that's my budget in best case scenario. I may be having less by the time I retire
[17:51:36] <Bco1981> i hope there is money in that for what ever else you need, like clothes, presents, new bed
[17:51:54] <ezekielnoob> life is too short not to have fun in my 30-40's
[17:51:59] <ezekielnoob> i get the grind
[17:52:01] <ezekielnoob> but
[17:52:15] <Bco1981> new couch, new tv sometimes throughout the years.
[17:52:15] <Sadale> I'd just need a decent computer. decent internet. tolerable housing. tolerable food.
[17:52:17] <ezekielnoob> what's the point of having tons of money by 60
[17:52:28] <Sadale> ezekielnoob++
[17:52:30] <ezekielnoob> i wanna have fun while i can
[17:52:35] <Sadale> ezekielnoob++

[17:52:40] <ezekielnoob> if i don't have money left by 60, i'll just kill myself

[17:52:56] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, lolololololol that sounds exactly like my plan xD
[17:53:05] <zoidberg> what's the point of life if we're gonna grind till 60?
[17:53:09] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, or I could just get back to Hong Kong SAR and take all those subsidize xD
[17:53:12] <ezekielnoob> i guess i can only talk like this because i have no kids
[17:53:20] <zoidberg> I will earn whatever I could till 40 and retire
[17:53:21] <ezekielnoob> im sure the perspective changes a lot if you have a familiy
[17:53:24] <Sadale> s/subsidize/subsidies/
[17:53:30] <Sadale> true
[17:53:38] <Sadale> What's even the point of having a kid anyway :/
[17:53:38] <zoidberg> I don't have family ezekielnoob 
[17:53:45] <zoidberg> I am a loner
[17:53:49] <ezekielnoob> we're all set!
[17:54:02] <ezekielnoob> well find a partner atleast :PP
[17:54:04] <Sadale> Sometimes I'm thinking if people who want to retire early should unite.
[17:54:08] <ezekielnoob> not all wants to have kids
[17:54:15] <Sadale> Maybe we could make some form of union and share part of our money.
[17:54:22] <zoidberg> if I move to country side, my expenses would be very less
[17:54:32] <Sadale> Sometimes it's cheaper to share stuffs.

[18:03:22] <Bco1981> zoidberg: Estonia last i heard.
[18:03:28] <Matt|home> .. i was "hired" sunday. signed paperwork monday. because of poor communication skills (hiring manager speaks 1.5 words of english) all she told me was that she'd give me the paperwork to sign electronically on monday. i have no idea when im supposed to come in, or what my schedule is. no call no text no email no update on their online portal thing. what's proper procedure.. call or walk in to see what's up?
[18:03:34] <ezekielnoob> so far this year i've put in like 10k USD in BTC

[21:03:54] <Urchin[emacs]> MootPoot: IDK about cheapest, but just defaulting to Raspberry Pi is reasonable, you can get a case for it pretty cheaply if you don't want it just hanging there in the open
[21:04:23] <Urchin[emacs]> MootPoot: it's also easily supported by whatever linux you want
[21:04:36] <Urchin[emacs]> well, almost any...
[21:04:39] <zoidberg> rpi is cheap but the accessories aren't
[21:04:51] <MootPoot> the problem with raspi shit is that getting boards is a pain
[21:05:26] <MootPoot> the chinese ones have annoying shipping, but the rpis are limited to 1 per person

[21:06:35] <MootPoot> maybe its just because I live up north here in moose land

[21:07:04] <MootPoot> "10 dollar or 5 dollar sbc board"...that when I start looking for its 20 bucks with 10 bucks shipping each

[21:45:12] <Cryowolf> MootPoot / zoidberg , you dont need to be very similar to your gf/bf, but you do need  your personalities to fit for the most part and having hobbies you both like is nice and all but if youre looking for that someone to have a long life with. Hobbies aren't gonna keep you together as much as love and personalities that mesh together. Because having personalities that are different, but fit nicely, THat's what makes it work....Imo

[23:30:56] <MootPoot> I wonder why trackballs never got popular
[23:31:15] <MootPoot> maybe its just production costs - cheaper to make normal mice and thats all anyone knows
[23:31:55] <Berlin36> looks awful IMHO
[23:32:21] * MootPoot shrugs
[23:32:38] <MootPoot> I dont see why anyone would be bothered by the looks of things which aren't meant to be used by being looked at
[23:32:46] <MootPoot> imo
[23:32:50] <Berlin36> that is true
[23:32:51] <Berlin36> but
[23:32:53] <Berlin36> also
[23:33:03] <Berlin36> i don't think they are very comfortable
[23:33:18] <Berlin36> though, i haven't tried one
[23:33:26] <MootPoot> speak for yourself - trackballs are 10/10 in the comfort area 
[23:33:37] <MootPoot> although the regular ball cleaning is annoying
[23:33:55] <Berlin36> do you use a trackball instead of a mouse?
[23:34:32] <Bco1981> it's a trackball mouse
[23:34:48] <MootPoot> ^
[23:34:57] <MootPoot> but I use both 
[23:35:17] <MootPoot> trackball for going places and when I'm space limited or just casual since the mouse dosen't need to move
[23:35:40] <MootPoot> normal mouse when I'm home - usually a MMO mouse, either a logi g600 or a razer naga pro
[23:35:51] <Bco1981> pretty fun because you can spin the ball very fast then the cursor looks like it it's reving up. then suddenly races across the screen
[23:36:04] <Bco1981> i used to do that with my friends trackball mouse
[23:36:14] <Bco1981> back when they were... hip
[23:36:44] <MootPoot> is a mouse with the ball on the bottom still a trackball mouse?
[23:37:03] <Bco1981> technically it is
[23:37:06] <Bco1981> but
[23:37:24] <ButterNoodle> I knew something was off with you MootPoot... u track ball user

[23:39:27] <ButterNoodle> funny you say 3 ball
[23:39:55] <Bco1981> some people like to carry extra ammo

[23:40:46] <ButterNoodle> I wanted to gift him used kids bicycle seat for secret santa
[23:41:11] <ButterNoodle> ofc 3 ball referred to the fact that he always one upped u in conversations
