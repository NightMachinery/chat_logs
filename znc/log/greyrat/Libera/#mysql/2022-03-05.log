[00:54:43] <sharpertool> Hey all. I'm running MysQL 5.7. We have a lot of MyISAM tables.. I'd like to convert them all to InnoDB. Can I setup a full slave on a different server, and convert tables on the slave to InnoDB, and then switch over to that server as the new production?
[00:54:53] <sharpertool> That is my "game plan", just wanted to get some feedback.
[01:06:38] <lopid> replicate from myisam to innodb?

[03:30:45] <sharpertool> Yes, that is correct. I believe I read somewhere that the replication slave does not care what storage engine is used.

[03:56:57] <ZenLogix> I am hoping to find a kind soul that could point me in the right direction: Looking at the output of "SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS", i am trying to figure out what the values of RECORD LOCKS space id ????? page no ?????? mean. I looked around the web/doc but could not figure it out. I am getting ready to do some spelunking in the source but it would
[03:56:57] <ZenLogix> be my first time digging in MySQL. Any pointers appreciated!
[03:59:20] <thumbs> "A record lock is a lock on an index record. For example, SELECT c1 FROM t WHERE c1 = 10 FOR UPDATE; prevents any other transaction from inserting, updating, or deleting rows where the value of t.c1 is 10.
[03:59:30] <thumbs> https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/innodb-locking.html
[04:06:21] <ZenLogix> @thumbs: Thanks for the quick reply! That being said and quite humbly, I believe i have an understanding of the general locking principles and transaction isolation of MySQL. What i am actually looking for is pointers on where to dig to understand the value of, as an example the ???? in the line that looks like RECORD LOCKS space id ????? page no
[04:06:21] <ZenLogix> ??????  in the output of  "SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS"

[04:12:39] <ZenLogix> Sure! 2 sec (it will be anonymized)
[04:12:55] <ZenLogix> RECORD LOCKS space id ???? page no ????????? n bits ??? index PRIMARY of table `CONFIDENTIAL`.`TABLE-NAME` trx id 24826955627 lock_mode X locks rec but not gap waiting
[04:13:44] <ZenLogix> And my understanding is that: this query has an exclusive record lock on a single record
[04:13:44] <thumbs> so MySQL locked id ??? for that table
[04:13:48] <thumbs> yes
[04:14:48] <ZenLogix> Just trying to figure out what Space Id and Page No are....
[04:15:20] <ZenLogix> I know what record is locked....
