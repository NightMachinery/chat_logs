[00:35:50] <alphamule> It's interesting to note that since say, a 512-byte message can be transformed with programs far in excess of 512 bytes of complexity, there are in fact many many possible ways not only to encode a given message keeping the ssame size(256^512 combinations), but there are basically an unlimited amount of algorithms that give equivalent results for a subset of possible inputs and outputs.

[15:37:08] <[itchyjunk]> Even if you have a prime and you multiply it by anything other than 1
[15:37:13] <[itchyjunk]> you will never get a prime
[15:37:30] <[itchyjunk]> prime is a number that only has 2 divisors, 1 and itself
[15:37:38] <LTCD> 15^some-long-number cannot equal a prime?
[15:37:51] <[itchyjunk]> if you're multiplying 2 numbers to get your number, it has at least 2 divisors thats not 1 and itself
[15:39:04] <LTCD> So whether I do multiplication or powers, with a non-prime or a prime, I will never encounter any primes?
[15:39:37] <[itchyjunk]> You should really think about the definition of prime and what you're asking
[15:39:49] <[itchyjunk]> prime can only have 2 factors, 1 and itself
[15:39:59] <[itchyjunk]> if you're starting off by multiplying 2 numbers that's not 1

[19:13:25] <isekaijin> causative: In your second example, log(x) has a symmetric distribution, but x itself doesn't.
[19:14:31] <isekaijin> But you have to define precisely what you mean by “bias for growing larger” anyway.
[19:14:50] <causative> x is equally likely to grow larger as it is to become smaller in either process, but the amounts are unequal in the second one
[19:15:10] <causative> two different meanings of a bias for growing larger or smaller
[19:16:02] <isekaijin> “Bias” already means something in statistics. (It's the difference between a parameter and an estimator of this parameter.)

[22:46:41] <Z-module> Well, in any general ring R at all, an ideal is just an additive subgroup I where  rI \subset I  and  Ir \subset I   for all r in R.  The polynomial version is just a useful example of an ideal, in a specific ring, namely  k[x_1,...,x_n]   where k is a field.

[22:51:19] <Emori> When we say that an integer k is invertible in Zm, do we mean that there exists an q \in any subclass of Zm such that kq = 1? Like q \in Z[0]m \union Z[1]m \union ... Z[m-1]m?
[22:51:34] <Z-module> yes
[22:52:07] <Z-module> It's the standard meaning of "invertible" in any ring at all:  x is invertible iff some y exists with xy = yx = 1  <-- the multiplicative identity of the ring in question.
[22:52:43] <Emori> Z-module I see. So is it also true that for example k \ in Z[0]m and q \in Z[m-1]m such that kq = qk = 1?
[22:52:50] *** Joins: blei (~blei@user/blei)
[22:52:51] <Z-module> you should really be talking about an invertible element of Z/mZ, not an "integer"
[22:53:11] <Emori> You're right. Is the notation Z/mZ?
[22:53:30] <Z-module> though people do sometimes say an integer k is "invertible mod m" if some integer q exists with  kq = 1 (mod m).  This *translates* to a statement about elements of the finite ring Z/mZ
[22:53:37] <Z-module> which are equivalence classes in Z, typically
[22:53:47] <Z-module> people vary a lot on the notation

[22:54:00] <Z-module> but really yes, it's the quotient ring of Z by its ideal mZ
[22:54:19] <Emori> I see that notation in the channel a lot so I will go by that.
[22:54:37] <Z-module> often people abbreviate it to  Z/m
[22:55:26] <Emori> You're right in my book the definition also says "An element r in Zm is said to be invertible if there is some x \in Zm such that rx = xr = 1"

[22:58:40] <friend> if 1 person experiences some event out of 500 people who were at risk of experiencing some event and this same thing happens every year, is it statistically responsible to claim that 1 out of 500 people experience this and therefore your risk of it happening to you is 1:500?

[23:02:37] <river> you have said 1/500 *who were at risk* experience it
[23:02:53] <river> that doesn't imply that: 1/500 *who were at risk AND those who are not at risk* experience it
[23:03:34] <friend> When is it appropriate then to use the US Population in its entirety to make a claim? ONly when the entire population is *at risk* right?
[23:04:20] <river> so the idea is to perform a measurement on a sample, and extrapolate that to the full US population
[23:04:28] <river> to get an accurate result,  your sample needs to be representative
[23:04:37] <Emori> Z-module I will ask a stupid question now. Suppose we are talking about Z/9. Then [7]_9 + [5]_9 = [3]_9. How do we arrive to such conclusion? I mean I somehow know how but it's not very clear.
[23:04:40] <river> e.g. if you only sample men - your result doesn't apply to men and women
[23:04:55] <friend> So if the event was "die during childbirth" it would be useless to extrapolate that to the entire population since only 50% can ever be pregnant or run the risk of dying during childbirth.
[23:05:00] <river> or if you only sample people in texas, it doesn't necessarily apply to everyone in the US
[23:05:47] <river> friend: suppose die during childbirth was 4% chance for women. It would be correct to say that it is 2% chance for the entire population
[23:05:56] <Z-module> Emori, because  7 + 5 = 12 = 3    in arithmetic mod 9
[23:06:07] <river> but saying this could be misleading, even though it is true
[23:06:12] <Z-module> that is, we can add or subtract or ignore any multiples of 9 during the computation

[23:09:46] <Z-module> and every element of Z/9 has infinitely many representatives you can use:  [0] = [-9] = [-18] = ... = [9] = [18] = [27] = ...
[23:10:13] <Z-module> simply the remainder after division by 9 is what determnes the element in Z/9Z
[23:11:02] <Emori> What do you mean by the latter? When the remainder is 0, then the element is in Z/9Z right?
[23:11:11] <Z-module> so by tradition we usually just use the remainders (representatives) from 0 up to m - 1  when identifying elements of Z/mZ, so that's 0 up to 8. But you *could* use any other possibilities instead.
[23:12:37] <Z-module> Z/9Z is just the nine elements [0]_9, [1]_9, ..., [8]_9.   People often just informally say Z/9Z = {0,1,...,8} but using + and * mod 9, not regular integer + and *
[23:13:25] <Z-module> We could talk about *formally* defining Z/mZ using the subgroup mZ and its m distinct cosets in Z, but I don't think that will help you understand it better.
