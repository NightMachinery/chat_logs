[08:35:02] <JollyRgrs> mine pops up a few times when i don't want it to... but never b/c i hit the headphone jack?
[08:35:02] <Cl0udNinja> been the same issue with multiple phones across multiple cars
[08:35:29] <TurkeyGibby> yeah, been on the google phone dick for a lot of phones now and thats never happened to me

[08:35:51] <Cl0udNinja> you'd think disabling google assistant would stop that from happening but it just makes a 'do you wanna enable assistant' pop up appear instead
[08:36:06] <Cl0udNinja> its been across multiple cars with multiple stereo brands

[08:43:10] <Cl0udNinja> TurkeyGibby, I literally only been prompted to get another phone today, because the notice on my banking app, but I think having to be more energy inefficient or having to upgrade my car stereos is a stupid way to also have to go to upgrade my phone
[08:43:31] <TurkeyGibby> then plug it in?!
[08:43:34] <TurkeyGibby> fucks sake man
[08:43:38] <PrincessZoey> I'm done upgrading shit for a while.
[08:43:39] <xe0n> smh...
[08:43:42] <Cl0udNinja> IF THEY DONT HAVE A HEADPHONE JACK HOW CAN I?!
[08:43:44] <PrincessZoey> got a new apple watch and macbook in the last 2 months lol
[08:43:44] <Hunterkll> it'll be a wash since newer phones are more efficient power sippers anyway
[08:43:54] <xe0n> a stereo to bluetooth adapter, powered by cig lighter
[08:43:54] <xe0n> done.
[08:43:58] <TurkeyGibby> we're offering a simple solution and you're acting like we're punching you in the dick
[08:44:06] <xe0n> you dont think legacy cars can use features like bluetooth?
[08:44:06] <xe0n> haha
[08:44:07] <Cl0udNinja> you arent.. phone companies are
[08:44:20] <xe0n> technology man :P
[08:44:27] <TurkeyGibby> find a phone that h as USB-C and a dongle that can charge and provides a headphone jack
[08:44:34] <xe0n> any auto parts shop will have stuff to make your stereo plug work with bluetooth or whatever
[08:44:39] <TurkeyGibby> this is fucking basic troubleshooting shit
[08:44:58] <xe0n> ^
[08:45:03] <TurkeyGibby> and speaking of, lack of adoption isn't going to get you anywhere.

[08:45:27] *** Joins: Croran (~Croran@71.231.214.173)
[08:45:38] <Hunterkll> for when im on road trips in other peoples cars
[08:46:05] <PrincessZoey> lmao my roommate saw what my twitch username and wondered how the hell I managed to snag it
[08:46:08] <xe0n> or you could always burn cds like csws
[08:46:12] <xe0n> hehehehheheheheh.gif
[08:46:15] <Cl0udNinja> yall love bluetooth so much, whats wrong with someone NOT wanting to have to use bluetooth
[08:46:27] <fritzwastaken> ok.. i cant eat a whole lot.. but im pretty sure I could sit down in front of this and go to town for 4-6 hours
[08:46:29] <fritzwastaken> https://youtu.be/2VnQ0FIects?t=53
[08:46:32] <xe0n> well the problem is phones dont have headphone jacks these days?
[08:46:33] <PrincessZoey> it's great for some things... ~~like vibrators~~
[08:46:34] <fritzwastaken> Love me some indian food
[08:46:46] <xe0n> and havent for years
[08:46:47] <xe0n> LOL
[08:46:55] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: the realities of currently available phones
[08:47:01] <fritzwastaken> Mine does, cause I have a cheap android
[08:47:02] <TurkeyGibby> You can not have Bluetooth, as I said hey the dongle fucks sake
[08:47:04] <Cl0udNinja> eh... the phone I have isnt *that* old.. and it has a headphone jack
[08:47:15] <TurkeyGibby> s/hey/get
[08:47:15] <xe0n> oooooookkkayyyyyy
[08:47:15] <layer8> TurkeyGibby meant: "You can not have Bluetooth, as I said get the dongle fucks sake"
[08:47:25] <PrincessZoey> I have an iphone 11
[08:47:25] <xe0n> well if you can get a modern phone with a modern operating system that has a headphone jack, great!
[08:47:27] <xe0n> problem solved
[08:47:33] <Cl0udNinja> ..
[08:47:40] <fritzwastaken> Dont androids still have headphone jacks?
[08:47:41] <PrincessZoey> the more impressive thing is I haven't smashed the screen in the year I've had it *knocks on wood*
[08:47:41] <Cl0udNinja> WHY THE FUCK DO YOU THINK I WAS ASKING IF ANYONE HAD ONE OF THE OSS PHONES
[08:47:43] <PrincessZoey> not all of them
[08:47:49] <fritzwastaken> or are you poorshaming non iphone users?
[08:47:50] <Cl0udNinja> I WAS LITERALLY TRYING TO GET OPINIONS/OPTIONS

[08:48:48] <csws> pixel 4a then put graphene or calyxos on it
[08:49:00] <TurkeyGibby> https://www.amazon.com/Charging-Compatible-Dreamvasion-Headphone-Converter/dp/B07KS49753
[08:49:07] <TurkeyGibby> done
[08:49:09] <TurkeyGibby> next
[08:49:22] <Hunterkll> lol
[08:49:29] <TurkeyGibby> jesus christ
[08:49:42] <Hunterkll> the librem 5 phone from purism is $1200 too
[08:49:56] <Hunterkll> 3GB ram, i.MX8M quad cpu, 32GB onboard storage
[08:50:04] <Hunterkll> at least the pinephone was priced accurately for the hardware inside of it
[08:50:14] <Hunterkll> oh yea, librem 5 also has a 52 week lead time right now apparently
[08:50:16] <Hunterkll> lol
[08:50:25] <Hunterkll> https://shop.puri.sm/shop/librem-5/
[08:50:42] <PrincessZoey> damn, fairphone doesn't even have a headphone jack anymore
[08:50:44] <Cl0udNinja> PrincessZoey, took a look, it does not
[08:51:01] <PrincessZoey> yeah I just looked too
[08:51:38] <Cl0udNinja> Hunterkll, yeah also that, which I mentioned earlier, what a bullshit time for my bank app to be like 'oh you gotta upgrade'
[08:51:47] <Hunterkll> i dont think my samsung has a jack but i dont even know where it is 
[08:51:59] <Cl0udNinja> JuSt GeT a NeW pHoNe!
[08:52:07] <Hunterkll> I use my cheaper iPhone 11 Pro Max as my primary phone :P
[08:52:12] <PrincessZoey> "cheaper"
[08:52:15] <PrincessZoey> fuck you lol
[08:52:21] <Hunterkll> well it was lol
[08:52:26] <Hunterkll> PrincessZoey: pfff i'm still paying them both off
[08:52:33] <Hunterkll> but it was like $100 cheaper than the Note 10+ 5G
[08:52:35] <PrincessZoey> ah
[08:52:42] <PrincessZoey> so not THAT Much cheaper
[08:52:46] <Cl0udNinja> Hunterkll, theres these but they arent shipping yet, not sure its worth it https://esolutions.shop/shop/murena-teracube-2e/
[08:53:02] <Hunterkll> the iphone does work better/more reliably/last longer anyay
[08:53:02] <TurkeyGibby> the fact your OS is so fucking old the *bank* says its time to upgrade is kinda telling tbh
[08:53:03] <Hunterkll> so meh
[08:53:04] <PrincessZoey> thought you may have had a surface duo or something, those are $1400
[08:53:21] <Hunterkll> PrincessZoey: erm, the Note 10+ 5G was like $1350 and the iphone $1249 
[08:53:22] <Hunterkll> lol
[08:53:34] <Cl0udNinja> TurkeyGibby, the first time I tried to update, it failed so I've left it since because every time I try, it wont update, so I've just given up tryin
[08:53:43] <PrincessZoey> Hunterkll: I've been running the developer beta versions of iOS for years. even the worst beta version is still better than android on a good day
[08:54:15] <PrincessZoey> well, 15.2 has broken wifi in 2 updates so far so that might finally be up for debate
[08:54:15] <Hunterkll> it's kinda why I gave up on android platform even back in Android 4 days from a systems development perspective
[08:54:25] <Hunterkll> the code base is just that frustrating / "how does this even fucking work" bad
[08:54:41] <TurkeyGibby> Cl0udNinja: as an IT person thats... even more telling. 
[08:54:49] <PrincessZoey> Having been on the beta stuff for so long made me realize just how unreliable jailbroken phones truly are
[08:55:08] <PrincessZoey> lol Cl0udNinja I installed an official update from LG on my phone and it bricked it 
[08:55:11] <Cl0udNinja> TurkeyGibby, why replace what works *shrug*
[08:55:22] <TurkeyGibby> ....
[08:55:28] <Cl0udNinja> literally the only real problem with my phone is that the rear camera is broken
[08:55:29] <xe0n> just go back to web banking man, problem solved
[08:55:35] <xe0n> walk into the bank to deposit and transfer money
[08:55:36] <xe0n> it works
[08:55:39] <xe0n> why replace it? :P
[08:55:48] <PrincessZoey> my banks don't have branches :P
[08:55:54] <xe0n> neither lol
[08:56:01] <Cl0udNinja> so you just stuff your money under the mattress then?
[08:56:19] <PrincessZoey> Cl0udNinja: nnah. has mobile check deposit, and can load cash at stores
[08:56:23] <Hunterkll> I think my physical android build server which used to run automated releases is only updated to android 7.... have a desktop VM that does it too but not automated to push releases/auto-test builds for tinkering on my phone taht's fully updated but ... meh, why bother anymore, it hasn't gotten any better
[08:56:42] <TurkeyGibby> I feel like discord users are somehow better at this point
[08:56:51] <csws> no TurkeyGibby 
[08:56:52] <csws> noooooo
[08:56:55] <csws> it's not true!
[08:57:05] <TurkeyGibby> csws: ARE YOU FUCKING READING WHAT I AM?
[08:57:41] <Hunterkll> PocketPC in 2003 was better than android is today 
[08:57:43] <Hunterkll> :P
[08:57:46] <PrincessZoey> TurkeyGibby: that's a very, very low bar
[08:58:12] <TurkeyGibby> PrincessZoey: thanks, you've helped achieve it
[08:58:35] <PrincessZoey> Hunterkll: after building (and writing the guide for) building android from source I am never dealing with that buggy pos like that again lol
[08:58:45] <PrincessZoey> wrote the guide for my phone*
[09:00:03] <Hunterkll> huh well
[09:00:08] <Hunterkll> no clue where the note 10 is 
[09:00:16] <csws> poor Cl0udNinja 
[09:00:18] <xe0n> couch ate it
[09:00:21] <Hunterkll> its around here somewhere, i recall taking it on my last trip probably tossed it in a box unpacking
[09:00:31] <csws> a lot of mid range android phones have headphone jacks
[09:00:43] <Hunterkll> might actually be in my radio backpack
[09:00:45] <csws> either that or immerse yourself in dongles
[09:00:48] <csws> don't give in to bluetooth
[09:01:02] <xe0n> says the guy who burns discs for his 12 stacker cd changer in the boot of his car
[09:01:09] <Hunterkll> LOL
[09:01:16] <csws> wtf it's not in the boot and I think it only does 6 geez
[09:01:19] <Hunterkll> I think I have a 6 or 8 disc changer somewhere with just one cartridge 
[09:01:22] <Hunterkll> in a box somewhere
[09:01:23] <xe0n> LOL
[09:01:25] <Hunterkll> with everything else
[09:01:34] <Hunterkll> cuz everything is in that mythical box
[09:01:35] <Hunterkll> lol
[09:01:39] <csws> idk if the car has line in
[09:01:42] <csws> I should check that actually
[09:01:45] <PrincessZoey> https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/compile-your-own-version-of-cm7-possibly-9-and-10-too-the-easy-way.1974420/
[09:02:27] <Hunterkll> my Nexus 6 sees a LOT of usage actually
[09:02:37] <Hunterkll> backup phone when travelling
[09:02:54] <Hunterkll> but with the sprint/t-mobile merger i might just cancel fi and revert it back to a GV account
[09:03:13] <Hunterkll> since the whole point was an oh-shit extra coverage phone
[09:03:33] <Hunterkll> throw a VZ prepaid sim card in it maybe idk
[09:03:39] <PrincessZoey> t-mobile fucked my bill up bad last month
[09:03:51] <PrincessZoey> I somehow wound up with 3 watch lines each with protection360
[09:04:09] <PrincessZoey> so it was like $50 more than it should have been
[09:04:13] <Hunterkll> i have some variant of that in lieu of paying apple directly for applecare
[09:04:46] <Hunterkll> you know i think the nexus 6 (and my work issued androids) might be the only android phones i've ever had WITH headphone jacks
[09:04:51] <Hunterkll> i don't recall if the G2 had one or not....
[09:04:54] <PrincessZoey> I have one watch with protection360 and they never actually activated apple care. (nevermind the fact I've had the watch a month and cellular STILL doesn't work!)
[09:05:08] <xe0n> move to spectrum
[09:05:13] <Hunterkll> lol
[09:05:13] <PrincessZoey> my mytouch 4g, Galaxy S3, and LG V35 thinQ all did
[09:05:15] <xe0n> LOL
[09:05:20] <PrincessZoey> xe0n: doesn't exist in my area sadly
[09:05:34] <PrincessZoey> we have uverse and cumcast
[09:05:49] <Hunterkll> my SH-06D from 2012 doesn't even have a headphone jack, th ough it also is kinda waterproof 
[09:07:04] <Hunterkll> headphone jacks are for people who didn't hack their RAZR's to load the itunes app on it and use it as a music player back in the day :P
[09:08:27] <xe0n> or for people who couldn't afford an ipod
[09:08:45] <Hunterkll> lol fucking ipod shuffle
[09:08:48] <Hunterkll> i think that was my first
[09:08:54] <Hunterkll> the Video 5G color was amazing tho
[09:09:06] <Hunterkll> transcoded so much shit to watch on the bus to school at an amaxing like 320p resolution
[09:09:18] <xe0n> i had a few, shuffle included
[09:09:32] <PrincessZoey> I got a first gen iPod for my 8th grade graduation
[09:09:34] <Hunterkll> i have an OG 1st gen around here somewhere i found at a hackerspace
[09:09:35] <PrincessZoey> I miss those things tbh
[09:09:43] <Hunterkll> it's oddly loaded full of bone thugs n harmony 
[09:09:43] <xe0n> remember when they came in the cool boxes
[09:09:49] <xe0n> BONE THUGS
[09:09:49] <PrincessZoey> oh god Hunterkll 
[09:09:49] <xe0n> LOL
[09:10:00] <Hunterkll> found it in a hackerspace lol *shrug*
[09:10:01] <xe0n> i use to use ephpod :P
[09:10:04] <xe0n> before itunes on windows was a thing
[09:10:08] <PrincessZoey> bone thugs (and harmony) are having a rap battle here in memphis

[09:11:07] <PrincessZoey> nevermind, not in memphis. just got announced in r/memphis
[09:11:14] <PrincessZoey> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/z3tKKWBD/image.png
[09:11:23] <xe0n> the ipod cable with both firewire and usb!
[09:11:28] <xe0n> i had one of them lol
[09:11:43] <Hunterkll> wasnt the USB charging only on the 1st gen
[09:11:43] <Hunterkll> lol
[09:11:52] <xe0n> nah 3rd or something
[09:11:54] <xe0n> i can't remember lol
[09:12:02] <Hunterkll> that was firewire going charging only
[09:12:03] <xe0n> look, seal approved of the ipod, so it must of been good from the get go
[09:12:21] <xe0n> and jony had hair back then
[09:12:23] <xe0n> soo
[09:12:24] <Hunterkll> i remember when itunes supported more than just ipods
[09:12:26] <Hunterkll> lol
[09:12:31] <Hunterkll> like my creative MP3 player
[09:12:34] <Hunterkll> but only on mac
[09:12:35] <Hunterkll> not on windows
[09:12:48] <xe0n> i remember when they said use musicmatch jukebox on windows
[09:12:50] <xe0n> nooooo thanks
[09:12:56] <xe0n> ephpod ++
[09:13:13] <TurkeyGibby> Remember XP media center?
[09:13:13] <Hunterkll> lol
[09:13:19] <Hunterkll> i used itunes with my fuckin' RAZR 
[09:13:25] <Hunterkll> after hacking the itunes applet into it
[09:13:50] <PrincessZoey> TurkeyGibby: yus
[09:13:57] <xe0n> loll my friend bought the u2 ipod and then a case so they could hide bono and the edge's signatures
[09:13:58] <xe0n> LOL
[09:14:01] <Hunterkll> had to jack up the firmware even more than I already had
[09:14:05] <xe0n> just wanted the black and red front
[09:14:06] <xe0n> LOL
[09:14:23] <PrincessZoey> I'm glad apple isn't totally against colors now
[09:14:27] <xe0n> or the HP branded ipod, that...if it busted you had to get HP to service
[09:14:29] <PrincessZoey> like yeah my macbook came in gray or silver only
[09:14:30] <Hunterkll> turning it into a V3ire was an adventure, and even now finding references to the ire variants is amazingly ..... difficult 
[09:14:35] <PrincessZoey> but my iPhone is purple and my watch is blue
[09:15:01] <Hunterkll> the ire actually enabled the EDGE data functionality that was built in.... instead of just GPRS

[09:56:25] <Hunterkll> essentially
[09:56:31] <Hunterkll> and the "DoD" wipe is mostly a myth
[09:56:40] <Hunterkll> 5220 doesn't actually specify standards and defers to organizations like NIST
[09:58:34] <Hunterkll> physical destruction is meant to cover things like reallocated sectors or other types of areas that may NOT bne caught (but a proper ATA secure erase implementaiton should catch those, but you'll need to check validation status of said implementation before re-use)

[09:59:17] <Hunterkll> might want to talk to a doctor
[09:59:36] <fritzwastaken> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGCIGEUB32M
[10:00:08] <SirSceptalot> either way, Hunterkll, I didn't even know DoD5220 was a thing that existed until just now.
[10:00:50] <SirSceptalot> I'm not concerned about standards, I was just wondering if it was actually possible or if it was just a myth.
[10:01:19] <SirSceptalot> at a certain point it becomes more cost effective to hit someone with a $5 wrench untill they tell you their secrets, as per xkcd
[10:03:09] <CoJaBo> Hunterkll: Technically, it was true back in the days of MFM drives
[10:03:28] <Hunterkll> not really
[10:03:28] <SirSceptalot> So if I get this straight: it's possible to recover some data from reallocated sectors if you only do a very simple zero-pass but you won't get much else, and you won't even get that if the disk has been wiped by a proper tool that wipes even that
[10:03:46] <Hunterkll> SirSceptalot: well, 'proper tool' in this case is the drive firmware itself
[10:03:52] <Hunterkll> some of them just straight up don't implement it or lie 
[10:03:54] <Hunterkll> lol
[10:03:56] <Hunterkll> or have major faults
[10:03:59] <Hunterkll> hence validation efforts
[10:04:03] <SirSceptalot> heh, ok, thanks
[10:04:16] <PrincessZoey> SirSceptalot: wanna know something super scary? my last IT job  believed saving all customer credit card data in quickbooks was super secure
[10:04:20] <Hunterkll> CoJaBo: you'd probably be surprised, we've done a lot of historic computer artifact recovery relying on techniques like that....
[10:04:20] <CoJaBo> The proper tool is thermite :P
[10:04:33] <CoJaBo> Can't read it if it's liquid
[10:04:48] <Hunterkll> you give me a 0-pass'd 15 or 30MB disk pack/drive and I can give  you the data back :D
[10:04:56] <Hunterkll> not so true for any 'modern' drives though 
[10:05:59] <PrincessZoey> that discussion was funny: "Quickbooks is not the least bit secure for credit card numbers. And even ignoring the elephant in the room that the fact your quickbooks user passwords are the company name and the current year notwithstanding. You upload the company files to backblaze as is as well as google drive. You're doing everything wrong."
[10:06:01] <CoJaBo> Hunterkll: If your floppy drive sucks enough, you can do that by accident
[10:06:14] <Hunterkll> CoJaBo: or if it's good enough, you can do it intentionally
[10:06:14] <Hunterkll> :D
[10:06:24] <CoJaBo> PrincessZoey: Still more secure than half of our clients :/
[10:06:31] <Hunterkll> but the risk of lab-grade recovery is considered mitigated at 15GB or higher density drives
[10:06:35] <PrincessZoey> granted that same company was adamant that zip disks were valid long term cold storage mediums...
[10:06:41] <Hunterkll> I'd say the best we could do ourselves would be single platter 500MB 
[10:06:48] <Hunterkll> but we're not even remotely concerned with capacities that large
[10:06:49] <Hunterkll> :P
[10:07:20] <CoJaBo> Hunterkll: Yeh, basically MFM or drives that used stepper motors, since the main limit to capacity was probably more positioning than anything else lol
[10:07:44] <Hunterkll> nah, we've done RLL work too 
[10:07:57] <Hunterkll> fair amount of low-cap IDE disks
[10:08:18] <PrincessZoey> "what's your SHIF solution for backups?" "we keep a few reasonably recent zip disks with all the important information backed up in a bank vault" "uhhh..." I should have ran just knowing that "reasonably recent" was at least a year old
[10:08:22] <CoJaBo> Hunterkll: Ever done any SMR drives?
[10:08:25] <Hunterkll> (using RLL controllers was also a neat way to upgrade your disk capacity)
[10:08:31] <CoJaBo> Or SSD?
[10:08:33] <Hunterkll> CoJaBo: they didn't exist in any format that'd be con sidered interesting to us
[10:08:39] <Hunterkll> and lol no
[10:08:59] <Hunterkll> i'm trying to read what was on the disk before it was written to with what is currently OS/interface readable on historic artifacts
[10:09:03] <Hunterkll> not recover modern media
[10:09:23] <Hunterkll> SSD would be far easier for me to work through than a regular HDD though 
[10:09:35] <Hunterkll> pop chips out, directly interface to the NAND 
[10:09:38] <Hunterkll> see what's what/where
[10:09:52] <Hunterkll> it's one of the more expensive routes to recover data from a failed SSD (especially if it's just controller failure)
[10:10:24] <Hunterkll> we've done PRML too, but that's an edge case
[10:10:34] <Hunterkll> that's more mid-90s shit and of less interest, usually
[10:10:54] <Hunterkll> most early IDEs used RLL internally until said mid-90s shift to PRML
[10:14:09] <Hunterkll> CoJaBo: but we're talking recovery like this kind - https://www.chrisfenton.com/cray-1-digital-archeology/

[10:44:17] <xe0n> :P
[10:44:24] <CoJaBo> Part of the shared-hosting/open_basedir nonsense that I was ranting about earlier
[10:44:26] <Hunterkll> remember the best efnet server?
[10:44:28] <Hunterkll> irc.aol.com
[10:44:28] <Hunterkll> :D
[10:44:41] <PrincessZoey> I wonder how my first IT boss is handling the death of aol desktop
[10:44:53] <xe0n> goodbye.wav
[10:44:55] <Hunterkll> i don't think ANYONE ever figured out why the fuck AOL was running an efnet IRC server
[10:44:58] <CoJaBo> Basically, someone kept DOSing the server by making PHP use too much RAM, and you just cannot fix that in a shared hosting environment, so we had to convert it to VPSes
[10:45:02] <Hunterkll> they never expoed it in any of their software
[10:45:09] <Hunterkll> but it was like one of the most reliable EFnet servers of the time
[10:45:12] <CoJaBo> BUT, we had to maintain all of the shared-hosting warts in the process <_<
[10:45:24] <CoJaBo> Including FTP. And open_basedir, apparently
[10:45:55] <CoJaBo> We haven't started moving the PHP5.2 sites yet
[10:46:05] <PrincessZoey> jesus. 5.2?
[10:46:17] <CoJaBo> Yep. Uses safemode, won't work without it
[10:46:28] <PrincessZoey> here I was thinking the hardcoded php7.4 in my wordpress playbook was a dinosaur
[10:46:41] <CoJaBo> Probably other issues too, but that was the first brick wall we ran into
[10:46:54] <CoJaBo> PrincessZoey: Our stuff is standardized on 7.2 atm
[10:47:19] <PrincessZoey> Past me was a fucking moron for hardcoding PHP and ubuntu requirements in that playbook
[10:47:33] <PrincessZoey> took literally 20 minutes to get rid of all of that
[10:48:34] <CoJaBo> We will have to support PHP 7.2 until at least 2023
[10:49:43] <PrincessZoey> that playbook was GREAT if you were still on ubuntu 17.04 lol
[10:52:30] <CoJaBo> Technically, 14.04 is still in extended support
[10:53:03] <PrincessZoey> yeah
[10:53:40] <PrincessZoey> the only problem it still has is one of the files it has to replace is hardcoded to php8.0 since I dunno how to make ansible find the proper folder for a newer php version (like 8.1 that released today)
[10:54:09] <CoJaBo> One of our clients asked if we support PHP 8.6 yet
[10:55:29] <CoJaBo> PrincessZoey: I was mistaken, it is 5.1
[10:55:38] <PrincessZoey> even worse lol
[10:55:53] <PrincessZoey> CoJaBo: you'll support it when it releases in 2-3 years lmao
[10:56:56] <CoJaBo> Support discontinued in 24 August 2006 (tho Ubuntu usually supports them for a few years beyond that)
[10:57:19] <CoJaBo> 5.1 is pre-JSON. Wow.
[10:57:56] <PrincessZoey> lmao, I was a sophmore in highschool when that was discontinued 
[10:58:24] <Hunterkll> oh here

[11:00:45] <Hunterkll> Ubuntu: Our userbase in that market is so small IBM had to bribe us to support something 
[11:01:04] <CoJaBo> 7.2 is missing soooo many cool features too :/
[11:01:10] <Hunterkll> or Ubuntu: when you want to make an application developer fucking hate life when they realize they have to support anything more than ubuntu
[11:01:58] <CoJaBo> All of our stuff really only HAS to run on LTS versions of Ubuntu
[11:02:05] <Hunterkll> Or even better
[11:02:28] <Hunterkll> Ubuntu: When someone's "my first mainframe app" only works on z/Architecture ubuntu, and no one in their right mind will touch that with a 50 foot pole
[11:02:30] <Hunterkll> :D
[11:03:17] <CoJaBo> I dodge that bullet, because our mainframe client doesn't run a POSIX-compliant OS

[11:03:35] <Hunterkll> we walked from a vendor who had a nearly perfect app and in-housed it because they wouldn't support anything other than Ubuntu for something we were building for a client
[11:03:40] <Hunterkll> so we just made it ourselves 
[11:03:40] <Hunterkll> lol
[11:04:40] <CoJaBo> We'll support anything if you pay us enough
[11:05:06] <Hunterkll> CoJaBo: heh, sure, now make it work on RHEL or SLES 
[11:05:28] <Hunterkll> oh sorry, throwing an extra $10mil to help you port it and providing developer assistance isn't enough?
[11:05:32] <Hunterkll> guess we'll just do it ourselves
[11:05:54] <CoJaBo> Win95, no problem. MS-DOS, happy to. OS/2 Warp4, fine by me. 4NICS, sure why not.
[11:06:03] <xe0n> not warp 4 lol
[11:06:05] <Hunterkll> oh for sure
[11:06:14] <Hunterkll> but gotta also meet the client requirements/regulatory requirements/etc 
[11:06:24] <CoJaBo> It is 2021, and we support all of those somewhere lol
[11:06:36] <Hunterkll> right, but this vendor flat out just said nah we aint gonna do it
[11:06:39] <xe0n> if you've got clients on warp 4, suggest they move to arcaos lol
[11:06:52] <Hunterkll> like do ing some basic linux housekeeping in their app development to make it work on 235960823905382 distros instead of just one 
[11:06:59] <Hunterkll> that we were willing to pay for
[11:07:01] <Hunterkll> but nooope
[11:08:15] <CoJaBo> xe0n: No reason to, it's a kiosk that does one thing and most assuredly DOES NOT have a touchscreen.
[11:08:31] <xe0n> okay
[11:08:40] <Hunterkll> as long as it's not networked *shrug*
[11:08:52] <Hunterkll> who needs to support anything resembling modern hardware or get repair parts
[11:08:53] <Hunterkll> :D
[11:08:56] <CoJaBo> One of the tickets we got on it was that the touchscreen didn't work lol
[11:09:16] <CoJaBo> The only thing that has ever broken on it during our contract, was the display (twice)
[11:09:30] <CoJaBo> Most likely from people pounding on it thinking it's a touchscreen :/
[11:09:34] <PrincessZoey> lmfao I figured out why my test blogs went fucky when I installed the 2nd blog. turns out the short name I used for both were identical (domain minus suffix). went to see if the 2nd one loaded properly, it loaded the right domain and the contents of the first one I setup xD. 
[11:09:41] <CoJaBo> It now calls you a perv if you touch the screen
[11:09:57] <CoJaBo> Haven't got a ticket on it since, so apparently that fixed it
[11:11:13] <CoJaBo> MS-DOS isn't even uncommon <_<
[11:12:09] <xe0n> yeah we run plenty of legacy junk
[11:12:13] <xe0n> oh well
[11:12:18] <CoJaBo> Hunterkll: One of the DOS machines even has mostly period-correct hardware, because it has an ISA card lol
[11:12:53] <CoJaBo> Ever tried to find an AT PSU in reasonable time in 2020's? Yeh...............................
[11:12:59] <CoJaBo> I had to mod an ATX lol

[11:45:47] <Hunterkll> hey my insurance policy covers machine guns!
[11:46:25] <SirSceptalot> as in, you're covered if your machine gun gets damaged, or if a machine gun damages your shit?
[11:46:37] <Hunterkll> oh idont have the accidental damage rider
[11:46:44] <Hunterkll> so i guess just malfunctions, theft, or destruction by some one else

[12:25:00] <Cl0udNinja> sometimes
[12:25:05] <fritzwastaken> You are good to go
[12:25:26] <fritzwastaken> Dont flirt with the wife, but be nice enough that you can eventually flirt with their sister or friend
[12:25:34] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[12:25:44] <fritzwastaken> im... not kidding
[12:25:48] <Cl0udNinja> I know
[12:26:02] <Cl0udNinja> they just got one of those marriages where I'm like 'what do you even see in that guy'
[12:26:02] <fritzwastaken> Dating is just like job hunting, its all about who you know and how much they like you
[12:26:15] <fritzwastaken> oh yea, dont judge their relationship either
[12:26:19] <fritzwastaken> or try to take the wife
[12:26:32] <Cl0udNinja> eh, I've given up dating at this point, online dating makes me want to strangle myself, and I'm a shut-in otherwise

[12:27:33] <Cl0udNinja> "relax, take in a stray..."
[12:27:40] <PrincessZoey> fritzwastaken: I was watching a dating show where autistic people try to find love. first line out of one of the people they follow: "finding a spouse is like a business transaction" was like what the fuckkk dude xD 
[12:28:04] * fritzwastaken looks at my wife with heavy autistic background
[12:28:08] <fritzwastaken> I dont disagree....
[12:28:35] <fritzwastaken> We refered to our inital dating situation as "The Contract"
[12:29:12] <fritzwastaken> Once we made it legal it was not as funny, but still enforced
[12:31:35] <fritzwastaken> I realize that sounds really insensitive but if you knew my wife PrincessZoey, it makes sense
[12:33:15] <fritzwastaken> I am an actual terrible human being, she has self esteem and depression issues and thinks shes horrible, but our contract states that I will always fight with her regarding how amazing she is
[12:34:37] <fritzwastaken> Constantly trying to reinforce how fucking badass she is and how lucky I am

[12:40:39] <PrincessZoey> instead of failing like i want it to, it drops the database xD
[12:42:21] <Cl0udNinja> I've had some really odd issues with ansible lately
[12:42:51] <Cl0udNinja> we decided to reorganize our playbooks repo because it was a mess, and now one of the playbooks throws 1 error in AWX and a totally different one in the shell
[12:44:04] <PrincessZoey> odd
[12:44:33] <fritzwastaken> ok.. so im up to 5 friends announceing first borns this thanksgiving
[12:44:42] <fritzwastaken> can anyone beat that?
[12:44:45] <Cl0udNinja> in shell, I get paramiko ssh banner errors, in AWX, one of the tasks fails, despite it having succeeded every time before we reorganized
[12:45:07] <fritzwastaken> "THE TURKEY AINT THE ONLY THING IN THE OVEN"
[12:45:31] <PrincessZoey> I happened to run it twice with almost identical domains (just different suffixes and it didn't notice the database with that name already existed. so instead of the welcome to wordpress I got the 2nd run with the first run's database/themes/plugins
[12:45:55] <Cl0udNinja> delegate_to gone wrong?
[12:46:31] <PrincessZoey> nope, same db name for them both
[12:46:50] <PrincessZoey> I'm almost positive no one will ever do this but meh
[12:47:18] <PrincessZoey> trying to add a check to make  sure the database doesn't exist and I just made it worse lol
[12:47:38] <PrincessZoey> instead of failing because the db exists it just nukes the database if it exists xD
[12:49:30] <Cl0udNinja> loool
[12:49:40] <Cl0udNinja> oh the db exists? well lets just make sure it doesnt
[12:49:42] <PrincessZoey> good thing it's a throwaway vps lol

[22:58:13] <rpifan> im always surprised how applying heat to almost any area of your body helps
[22:58:21] <rpifan> apply heat to belly all of a sudden it feels better and works better
[22:58:50] <rpifan> apply heat to legs they feel better. its sorta weird we are designed with that sorta release valve
[23:02:52] <Activ8> The problem with variants is if variants continue people will always need a jab for the resistant strain constantly.
[23:02:58] <Activ8> that’s not good.
[23:03:32] <rpifan> Activ8, my proposal is to lockdown constantly
[23:03:59] <Activ8> that’s can’t happen the government can’t just keep giving handouts

[23:09:19] <mistiry> yeah 4 is good
[23:09:19] <rpifan> i bought the recent tropic and of course it was made by germans so ti was trash
[23:09:46] <mistiry> not sure if i have 4 on PC or not. i have 5 and 6.
[23:09:52] <mistiry> 3 was my first
[23:10:00] <mistiry> 4 i fucking dominated
