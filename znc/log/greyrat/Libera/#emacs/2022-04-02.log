[03:23:46] <Catie> It is not, no. It's a value that has to exist somewhere that the argument to the function is being compared against.

[05:38:03] <parsnip> ugh, why do so many white papers not have a date
[05:38:23] <jensen> is running emacs as daemon for quick startup simply a thing everyone should do and if not, what are good reasons to run it normally standalone?

[05:38:55] <bremner> jensen: basically yes

[05:39:35] <parsnip> jensen: on Linux, where it's easier to setup, it's probably more reasonable to be using daemon sooner. but if the daemon is contributing to issues to troubleshoot, i would temporarily avoid it.
[05:39:42] <corwin> I don't think I understand.  Are you using "window" here in the Emacs sense?

[05:43:44] <jensen> (disclaimer: noob), i mean when i tried using lsp-mode and flycheck-mode, flycheck-list-errors by default for me takes up half the screen on a different buffer. i imagine if opening this buffer in a separate tiling window makes resizing seamless and more convenient than doing that within Emacs without using the mouse.

[05:48:26] <parsnip> because you'll probably want to click on flycheck elements, to jump to the lint, and i'm not sure that will work if you split the emacs windows into two emacs frames, allowing you to using twm to manage the frames. not sure that will allow clicking in flycheck list to work.
[05:48:47] <parsnip> try it and see. :-)
[05:49:00] <parsnip> to split a window out into its own frame, try C-x 5 2, iirc

[05:50:31] <jensen> lots of packages open frames that split e.g. 50%, 33%, or whatever depeneding on existing frames opened. usually, like flycheck-list-errors for example, they don't need to be relatively as big as other windows. i want to avoid using the mouse to resize them all the time and have more tiling window manager-like features that are keyboard driven, like resizing, swapping frames (buffers?). maybe even

Almost all the bonobos present interpreted this as an aggressive display, and reacted with loud screams, tooth-baring, and pounding the walls and the floor. Kanzi, who remained calm, communicated with Savage-Rumbaugh using bonobo vocalizations; Savage-Rumbaugh interpreted these
[09:19:17] <parsnip> vocalizations, and said to Raffaele, "he'd like you to do it again just for him, in a room out back, so the others won't get upset." Later, a private performance in another room was carried out.[17]

[12:17:58] <parsnip> hominoidea slap! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXo-BpE8T8
[12:18:29] <bpalmer> Ox151: you should make a function that calls org-timer-set-time with the argument.

[12:20:10] <parsnip> (ignoring the argument part of problem)
[12:20:32] <parsnip> C-h f interactive RET may help clarify the argument part
[12:20:48] <bpalmer> A simple way to do that is somethign like (defun 0x151/set-timer (n) (interactive "P") (org-timer-set-time (or n 25)))
[12:21:11] <bpalmer> and then (global-set-key (kbd "C-c t") '0x151/set-timer)
[12:21:28] <bpalmer> Then by default, C-c t does the 25 thing, and C-u 10 C-c t calls it with 10 instead.

[15:00:05] <bpalmer> markdown is plain text.
[15:00:08] <gnoo> gnus-article-browse-html-article if there are more than one article, gnus will only save the first one
[15:00:26] <parsnip> and yet...
[15:01:10] <parsnip> bpalmer: matrix doesn't store it as markdown, i guess
[15:01:26] <bpalmer> I have a real bug about people who insist on rendering markdown.
[15:01:34] <parsnip> `"format": "org.matrix.custom.html",`
[15:02:04] <parsnip> so to prevent that, i would have to prefix every message with /plain
[15:02:28] <parsnip> of course, the IRC bridge might successfully send that message as markdown
[15:02:37] <parsnip> but who knows exactly what they'll do
[15:02:57] <parsnip> IRC bridge can be funky, and has done unfortunate things in the past
[15:02:59] *** Joins: galcerte (~galcerte@user/galcerte)
[15:03:24] <parsnip> some time ago, you may have seen matrix users sending annoying quoting of previous messages
[15:03:34] <parsnip> i think they finally disabled that in the IRC bridge
[15:03:40] <bpalmer> Yes, I believe so.
[15:03:48] <parsnip> disgusting
[15:04:15] <bpalmer> well, this is the sort of thing to deal with when you're trying to make systems interoperable.
[15:04:32] <parsnip> yes
[15:04:34] <bpalmer> (Not to belabor the point, but I'm waiting for actual details to come out of the EU's DMA proposal; I'm not optimistic)

[15:05:35] <bpalmer> artefact: at the same time, US-ASCII is pretty much the lowest common denominator, and it's not sufficient for a global messaging system.

[15:06:24] <artefact> i mean, it *is* hard, but most of the hard work has been done
[15:06:32] <bpalmer> it's also not hard to bolt markdown on (and even rely on it being rendered, I suppose); or send two messages, one a quote and one a response
[15:06:37] <parsnip> but also, yeah, email should work from a text editor
[15:07:08] <artefact> my stupid *bank* sends html email, and the plain text version is the stock default from whatever software they use. the contents doesn't match and they don't care

[15:07:35] <parsnip> what is stock default? does it even have your info?

[15:11:55] <artefact> sorry if i ruffled some feathers, i didn't mean to
[15:12:04] <parsnip> "nuke" is a common joke term here, especially about deleting borked init files

[21:29:59] <Guest63> corwin If you have like idea of toggling as i said tab to indent, again tab to unindent.
[21:29:59] <Guest63> What are you ideas would you do that?
[21:30:00] <Guest63> As my idea, it was using global-variable, what are other ways to do

[21:32:26] <corwin> Guest63: one easy approach could be to check the value of `last-command' and if it's the same command as is running then do your alternate behaviour
[21:33:14] <Guest63> umm yes but what if user have done other command in that last command after pressing.
[21:33:47] <Guest63> like he press tab  , done other job, again gone to that line and press tab
[21:35:11] <Guest63> ok i can do go to list of all history and check the previous command exists or not
[21:35:11] <Guest63> will that be efficient or using global-variable would be efficient or any other?

[21:37:13] <corwin> If you want to be "smarter" then you would look and see if the present line starts with spaces (or tabs, maybe).  Perhaps using `looking-back'.   For a POC of the 'simple' way, https://bpa.st/KEQA

[23:32:11] <talismanick> lagash: I suppose so
[23:32:49] <talismanick> It's not something I can really understand, as I barely use my phone and everyone I know knows how to use a computer, but it's what the news says
[23:33:18] <artefact> oh, i can understand. i teach high schoolers. they don't know what's a file, or a folder
[23:33:59] <technomancy> I feel like phone OSes are specifically designed to prevent you from understanding how phones work
[23:34:26] <technomancy> like they still have a filesystem but they present it in such a shitty inconsistent way that you can't develop an intuition for how they work based on interacting with your phone
[23:34:42] <talismanick> In retrospect, Stallman was completely right in his assessment of Steve Jobs after the fact
[23:34:55] <johnjaye> technomancy: yeah i still don't really get how to select the usb card other than /storage/emulated/0
[23:34:58] <johnjaye> whatever that means
[23:35:21] <talismanick> And yet everyone called it insensitive hyperbole in poor taste
[23:35:23] <technomancy> I don't think you can blame "kids these days" or whatever
[23:35:42] <technomancy> they're just exposed to systems specifically designed to disempower them
[23:35:43] <artefact> no, the kids are not to blame. they just grok whatever tools they use
[23:35:51] <talismanick> technomancy: It's not a matter of blame so much as assessing where we're realistically at
[23:36:06] <johnjaye> talismanick: apple isn't even the dominant pc maker though
[23:36:22] <lagash> What's that quote? The older generation laments how the younger generation turned out, as if they never had anything to do with it.
[23:36:26] <talismanick> johnjaye: They're the ones who touched off the smartphone trend
[23:36:28] <johnjaye> well something can be insensitive and true
[23:36:30] <artefact> i may be faster typing on a keyboard, but they are ten times faster than me typing on a touch screen virtual kbd
[23:37:04] <technomancy> johnjaye: not "dominant" in market share, but dominant in terms of influence
[23:37:08] <talismanick> johnjaye: Yes, but the point is people didn't understand why Stallman had every right to say what he did
[23:37:13] <technomancy> in that all the other manufacturers tend to copy their mistakes

[23:38:23] <talismanick> With the final stretch of innovations attached to his name, Jobs did damage to how we use computers and therefore how we think, the likes of which we're only beginning to see the effects of
[23:38:42] <talismanick> They should've made the iPad with a pen first, like Kay was telling Jobs
[23:39:31] <technomancy> a while back someone asked me if I thought Shuttleworth was "the Steve Jobs of linux" and I was like "no I don't think he's been nearly harmful enough to merit that name" but it turns out he was asking about it in like ... a positive way, somehow.
[23:39:58] <artefact> "think different" heh. aged almost as badly as "do no evil"
[23:40:00] <johnjaye> well yeah wasn't the whole point of canonical to make linux look like macos?
[23:40:04] <leah2> he's not very much of a visionary, is he?
[23:40:10] <johnjaye> which they failed at apparently. but at least they tried

[23:50:23] <artefact> nothing you wouldn't find on 4chan
