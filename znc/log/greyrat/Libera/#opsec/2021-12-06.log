[02:04:07] <Joanna> Hi everyone
[02:20:56] <Joanna> Yesterday I discovered some interesting podcasts with a guest named John Titus
[03:15:48] <Joanna> Hydragyrum: do you think that there is bad stuff in most versions of Linux that don’t have opensource core ?
[03:16:29] <jan6> drivers
[03:17:17] <Hydragyrum> there may be, not much way of telling for sure, but the drivers are pretty important sometimes
[03:18:18] <Joanna> So could there be backdoors installed in the blob code of most versions of Linux?
[03:19:46] <jan6> there could be backdoors in even open source software
[03:19:53] <jan6> specifically self-bootstrapping ones
[03:20:02] <jan6> ever heard of Ken Thompson Hack?
[03:21:32] <Joanna> This doesn’t surprise me I’ve believed that open source things are not necessarily fully audited by trustworthy people for a long time
[03:22:32] <Joanna> Why do people put up with blobs of closed source code I wonder.
[03:22:42] <jan6> ken thompson hack is basically "backdoor in the compiler, so seemingly good source code gets injected, and since you can also inject every monitoring and debugging tool, nobody would ever know"
[03:22:58] <Joanna> If they are using Linux because they value opensource
[03:23:43] <jan6> like, say you hack GCC, then it can just patch up every new instance of GCC that compiler compiles, and eventually EVERY GCC binary would be patched with the backdoor
[03:23:53] <jan6> obviously it's not that practical
[03:24:04] <Joanna> jan6: so you need an opensource compiler?
[03:24:17] <Hydragyrum> gcc is GNU so fully opensource
[03:25:07] <jan6> you'd need to input raw machine binary to make an assembler, then use that assembler to make a C compiler, then use that compiler, to compile whatever you want, such as gcc, and even then, only YOU would know it's actually free of any secretly injected backdoors
[03:25:54] <Hydragyrum> you'd still have to assume your cpu is free of those
[03:26:09] <Hydragyrum> and the rest of your hardware
[03:26:17] <jan6> well, you can't DO anything about hardware like CPU
[03:26:33] <Hydragyrum> make your own
[03:26:41] <jan6> unless you wanna run a ~1MHz self-made CPU, of course, lol
[03:27:04] <Hydragyrum> or if you want to be more trusting, buy from one of the open-source-hardware vendors instead of something like intel
[03:27:29] <Joanna> I often wonder why large countries don’t create their own computers and software
[03:27:33] <jan6> btw there is some dude or two who's actually managing to DIY such tiny chips with litography or whatever, idk
[03:28:06] <jan6> of course, still not perfect, and still not too small, but it'd allow you to make at least SOMEWHAT reasonable CPU
[03:28:29] <jan6> like instead of a massive box, it'd be merely a human-sized box
[03:28:30] <jan6> lol
[03:28:40] <jan6> s/massive/room-sized
[03:29:09] <jan6> Joanna: prolly because of convenience, and because their products would be way inferior to existing ones, for a long time
[03:29:51] <jan6> unless you just build them according to existing specs, using existing equipment, and just slap down your own factory using them
[03:30:47] <Joanna> What about china? They could modify existing technology that they have collected and improve it.
[03:30:54] *** Joins: Atque (~Atque@user/atque)
[03:31:18] <jan6> china doesn't make "china cpu" exactly, iirc, but they do by proxy ;P
[03:31:45] <jan6> https://www.electropages.com/blog/2021/04/china-developing-its-own-cpu-instruction-set-architecture
[03:31:49] <jan6> https://www.tomshardware.com/features/zhaoxin-kx-u6780a-x86-cpu-tested
[03:31:52] <jan6> maybe they do, hm
[03:32:03] <Joanna> They can reverse engineer things and improve
[03:33:13] <jan6> oh that they do, unofficially, all the time
[03:33:39] <jan6> plus leaks from official contractors and factories
[03:34:29] <Joanna> So they can’t be hacked so easily if their computers aren’t using an os familiar to hackers
[03:34:42] <jan6> oh OS is WAY simpler, lol
[03:35:06] <jan6> huawei's been working on an "universal OS" for some time, similar idea to Fuchia
[03:35:28] <jan6> one OS to rule 'em all, to run on phones, computers, fridges, every device would run the same OS
[03:35:59] <jan6> and hardware-wise, you can always go with risc-v
[03:36:22] <Hydragyrum> one OS to d00r them all ;)
[03:36:42] <jan6> shush ;P
[03:36:49] <jan6> that's not part of the advertising
[03:37:44] <jan6> software-wise, if your OS's posix-compliant, even if not very unix-like otherwise, then you can probably port over programs pretty easily, AKA unfamiliar, but not a total pain in the azz
[03:38:19] <jan6> even android, is technically linux, but runs a verrrry different userland, with different filesystem hierarchy and everything
[03:38:32] <jan6> and that's still linux, you could go way beyond that
[03:40:05] <jan6> and tbh, you can run same machine code on any OS, so if you don't use OS-specific libraries...
[03:40:22] <jan6> that's also the premise of Cosmopolitian libc
[03:40:34] <jan6> https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan
[03:40:50] <jan6> or, well
[03:41:07] <jan6> it's actually the premise of https://justine.lol/ape.html on top of which cosmopolitian provides a libc
[03:42:18] <jan6> of course the current implementation of them has the flaw that they assume x86, with no other architectures supported, but same idea should be reasonably portable
[03:42:22] *** Quits: shibboleth (~shibbolet@user/shibboleth) (Quit: shibboleth)
[03:45:09] <jan6> I love those two projects
[03:45:38] <jan6> pure basic C, and you can even boot the code without an OS if you want...
[03:51:13] <jan6> related, https://redbean.dev/ is awesome
[03:56:27] *** Joins: sn1tch3r (~sn1tch3r@user/sn1tch3r)
[03:59:03] <Joanna> I don’t do c :)
[03:59:45] <jan6> neither do I
[03:59:49] <jan6> I do shell scripts
[03:59:50] <jan6> lol
[04:00:13] <jan6> making a passwordstore.com-like password manager is actually really trivial
[04:00:20] <jan6> even in shell script
[04:00:39] <jan6> ls
[04:01:40] <jan6> wc -c tmp/pusswordstore.sh
[04:01:40] <jan6> 498 tmp/pusswordstore.sh
[04:02:26] <Joanna> The last time I did a shell script I think was for a class I took on unix os
[04:02:41] <jan6> supports adding, removing, editing, and listing of "passwords", and only needs standard unix tools + an encryption-decryption utility (wrpped in a helper function for easy swapping)
[04:03:08] <jan6> it's very much "jan6-json" (AKA not really readable), right now, lol
[04:03:38] <jan6> #!/bin/sh
[04:03:38] <jan6> crypt(){ case "$1" in ("-e")scrypt enc "$2" >"$2.new";mv "$2.new" "$2";;("-d")scrypt dec "$2";;esac;}
[04:03:38] <jan6> puss(){ puss_dir="${puss_dir:-~/.pusswordstore}";mkdir -p "$puss_dir";pw="$puss_dir/$2";case "$1" in ("add")read -r i;echo $i >"$pw"&&crypt -e "$pw";;("del")rm "$pw";;("edit")t="$(mktemp)";cp -p "$pw" "$t";crypt -d "$pw" >"$t";"${EDITOR:-vi}" "$t"&&crypt -e "$t";mv "$t" "$pw";;("read")crypt -d "pw";;("")find "$puss_dir"|sed "s|^$puss_dir||;/^\$/d";;(*)crypt -d "$puss_dir/$1";;esac;}
[04:03:52] *** Quits: sn1tch3r (~sn1tch3r@user/sn1tch3r) (Quit: Leaving)
[04:03:55] <jan6> I had it support helptext, but lost that version because I didn't save it
[04:03:56] <jan6> lol
[04:04:38] <jan6> puss is both a play on "pass" (passwordstore.org), and also at how hacky it is
[04:05:12] <jan6> but it's really really simple, in principle
[04:06:04] <Joanna> I’ve never trusted those password managers
[04:06:11] <jan6> you can trust this onw
[04:06:13] <jan6> one
[04:06:28] <jan6> since it's literally as secure as whatever function you wrap with crypt()
[04:06:46] <jan6> be it scrypt, pgp, aes-256, or whatever
[04:07:41] <jan6> literally all it's doing it calling "please encrypt this file" and "please decrypt this file", using the program of your choice (used scrypt for an example)
[04:08:59] <jan6> I've never bothered with password managers myself, because they use password stores, lol
[04:09:40] <jan6> there's also generative ones, like LessPass, and also cool ones like passwordcard.org
[04:10:29] <jan6> passwordcard is literally "here's a card of random numbers and symbols, you can regenerate it with this little code, have fun, and figure out your own strategy for making passwords with it!"
[04:10:49] <jan6> there's an ancient java program for CLI usage (still works), so you're not locked to the website either
[04:11:19] <jan6> I don't have a laminator, otherwise I'd prolly use it, even
