[00:36:41] <__adrian> \w is already a character class, you can't use it to make a range
[00:38:04] <__adrian> are you _intending_ to make a range?

[00:57:27] <__adrian> NakedKing: that shows the same regex you originally posted.
[00:57:36] <__adrian> and the dom parser is not relevant at all
[00:58:10] <__adrian> do you understand what a "regular expression" is?
[00:58:35] <biberu> hm, almost 1800 lines in a single file, no tests, maintained by a single random person on the internet, with a commit on average twice in a decade?
[00:59:31] <NakedKing> yes, shortly regex :P i know, but i dont have knowledge about it yet. i want, i need and i will. But i'm out of time. Just want to fix this and go to sleep. My eyes are bloody...
[00:59:49] <TinoDidriksen> Why would you use that over just DOM and XPath? From what I can see, it doesn't really add anything useful.
[01:00:17] <__adrian> NakedKing: the way to fix it is to learn about it
[01:00:18] <biberu> NakedKing: regex aside, i'd review your process for reviewing dependencies ^^
[01:00:45] <__adrian> you can't even tell us what you're trying to do; we couldn't "just fix it" even if we wanted to.
[01:01:08] <__adrian> "are you trying to make a character range? or do you want a literal dash?"
[01:01:44] <__adrian> if you don't know what you want, then you're not ready to solve this problem.
[01:01:48] <NakedKing> i'm seperating datas from a html page body. i send the body to domparser.      $html = new DOM();  $html->load($page->getBody());
[01:02:12] <__adrian> that's got nothing to do with anything. i'm asking about the pattern you showed us.
[01:02:41] <__adrian> when you typed that  -  did you want to make a character range? or did you want a literal dash?
[01:03:32] <NakedKing> What could htmldom have intended? it's more important than i think, because i dont have any idea.
[01:03:44] <__adrian> you'd need to ask the authors there.

[01:04:36] <NakedKing> something must be changed about regex on php 5 to 8

[01:04:50] <NakedKing> i wont look up changelogs. i will try another packages
[01:05:07] <__adrian> but that doesn't tell us the author's intent
[01:05:43] <__adrian> and doesnt change what you should do - find the author/support channel for that package
[01:05:49] <NakedKing> you are right.
[01:06:10] <NakedKing> TinoDidriksen, https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/dom_crawler.html  this seems interesting and its using XPath. maybe i can handle with iy
[01:06:13] <__adrian> or if you want to fix it yourself, there's no choice but to study it and figure out what's going on
[01:06:45] <da_wunder> really that part "i wont look up changelogs." - if you're using that - you really should look that changelog...
[01:08:00] <relipse> oh wait
[01:08:04] <relipse> NakedKing is right
[01:08:13] <relipse> php 8 stopped allowing -
[01:08:17] <TinoDidriksen> It comes from https://github.com/jorgecasas/htmldomparser/blob/master/src/HTMLDOMParser/DOM.php#L704 (and further down) and has to do with finding attribute names, which allows both dash and colon. So it is highly likely the author meant to include literal dash and simply added : without knowing that's formally an error.
[01:08:32] <relipse> you need to add a \ before - NakedKing
[01:08:37] <da_wunder> that kind of attitude "i wont look up changelogs." is - imho - just wrong
[01:08:38] <relipse> if you want to make it PHP 8 Friendly
[01:08:39] <NakedKing> __adrian, can you draw something from here? $places_tag = $html->find('div.restaurantsearchresultstitle .grid', 0);  and this aims:      <div class="restaurantsearchresultstitle grid-18 ">
[01:09:29] <da_wunder> if you're using something, you really need to check those changelogs before you update
[01:09:30] <__adrian> sorry, no idea what you're asking
[01:09:31] <NakedKing> relipse, will it be correct: ("/^[\w:]+$/"

[01:09:48] <__adrian> NakedKing: see TinoDidriksen's comment
[01:10:28] <TinoDidriksen> It should just be [-\w:] - when you start the [] with dash then it's always interpreted as a literal.
[01:10:35] <__adrian> and say thanks for the effort  ;)  that's the kind of investigation you need to be doing
[01:11:04] <__adrian> (i'd recommend "always \" though)
[01:11:40] <relipse> NakedKing, no check this out, PHP 8 upgraded their REGEX so that you cannot have a stray - when it is ambiguous
[01:11:43] <TinoDidriksen> I don't like superfluous escaping. I'd rather re-arrange to not need \. But in this case it does assume the reader knows regex classes.
[01:12:57] <NakedKing> thanks you all for your helps (*.*c)
[01:13:36] <relipse> Your code is"/^[\w-:]+$/" {, should be "/^[\w\\-:]+$/", am I correct __adrian ?
[01:14:13] <__adrian>  \-
[01:14:38] <relipse> i thought because of the " it needed double escaping
[01:15:14] <__adrian> you're thinking of php, not regex. the "quotes" around the string are php.
[01:15:32] <hresco3> Running a utility script supplied by an application I host, yields me: `Undefined constant "PEAR_ERROR_CALLBACK"` for my troubles, on a php8 installation.  Any thoughts on how I might work-around this issue ???
[01:16:19] <__adrian> also note that in both cases:  " \ "  and " \\ " you'll end up with one backslash in the string.

[16:26:01] <velix> seems just an additional unknown dependency to me.
[16:26:04] <Blondie101010> velix:  why?  if you prefer something else, use it
[16:26:10] <Blondie101010> dependency?
[16:26:12] <Blondie101010> it's not
[16:26:47] <velix> Blondie101010: many guys seem to use this: https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv
[16:26:49] <Blondie101010> it's just one of many ways you can control a config file
[16:27:36] <Blondie101010> ok so why question it if you're interested...  just try it
[16:28:05] <velix> Blondie101010: Sure. But for me, it seems insecure that a secret is in $ENV or $SERVER. If someone dropped/missed a phpinfo() in the code, it will be exposed, since it's global.
[16:28:24] <velix> When I load the credentials when I need them, they're just available in this single script.
[16:28:32] <Blondie101010> ok so don't use that then
[16:28:37] <__adrian> ^
[16:28:41] <Blondie101010> but how will you do it?
[16:28:44] <__adrian> many people don't use it  ;)
[16:29:09] <velix> Blondie101010: The wrong way I guess.
[16:29:39] <Blondie101010> how will you pass your secret to PHP?  not saying dotenv is better, but the problem you mentioned is present for most approaches
[16:30:09] <velix> I thought about simply reqiring a php file (which seems to be bad) or file()/file_get_contents() and parse it.
[16:30:34] <velix> like .secrets with <?php const secret='123';
[16:31:12] <velix> the file_get_contents way, it never would get exposed.
[16:32:00] <__adrian> orly
[16:32:39] <velix> orly: "In response to someone who has insulted you or has aggressively disagreed with you"
[16:32:49] <velix> __adrian: why do you disagree?
[16:33:01] <__adrian> how do you figure it's not globally available?
[16:33:17] <__adrian> also, if you did mean file_get_contents(), why would you write php code with the intent of not using it as php code?
[16:33:53] <hans> i'd just use a config.php
[16:33:59] <__adrian> ^
[16:34:02] <velix> __adrian: Let's say, php-fpm update on Debian kicks away php-config (happens often). This would expose the sourcecode (happens often).
[16:34:16] <velix> sure, require(config.php) wouldn't also get exposed then ,true.
[16:34:19] <__adrian> still basically globally available but none of the oddities in parsing php code
[16:34:19] <velix> okay, true.
[16:34:34] <velix> __adrian: since when are normal variables globally available?
[16:34:47] <velix> $ENV and $SERVER are. in any script, always.
[16:34:55] <biberu> velix: do you have php code in your wwwroot?
[16:35:06] <__adrian> velix> This would expose the sourcecode (happens often)  // your code is in the wrong place. don't put it under the doc root.
[16:35:31] <biberu> velix: even if the server is misconfigured it shouldn't be possible to see anything other than some index file
[16:35:33] <velix> biberu: Yes, BUT: my apache isn't allowed to read it. Only the php-fpm user is ;)
[16:35:47] <__adrian> "velix> __adrian: since when are normal variables globally available?"  since any time you define them in the global scope. but i'm talking about the file
[16:36:20] <velix> biberu: Debian's defaults are very bad. I've often seen php code in Apache ;)
[16:36:23] <biberu> velix: that's just another source for mistakes
[16:36:26] <__adrian> and if you meant to `include` that file (which would make sense) then we're not talking about $variables at all, it's a const
[16:36:31] <velix> biberu: Yop, but I can deal with this.
[16:36:50] <biberu> so, don't use those?
[16:36:53] <__adrian> and if you did mean `file_get_contents` then back to my earlier question
[16:37:18] <rwb> hi, is this a good place to ask a question about php-fpm?
[16:37:39] <velix> __adrian: Need to think about this first.
[16:37:58] <__adrian> rwb: someone here might know what you're looking for, but not specifically. this cannel is for code help.
[16:38:06] <__adrian> *channel
[16:38:11] <rwb> i see, i'll ask and hopefully someone will take a look then
[16:38:41] <rwb> for some reason once every two weeks or so, php-fpm just gets "stuck" with no apparent reason (no cpu/network load, when i display fpm stats doesn't seem like anything is out of the ordinary). restarting it works, but the downtime is annoying. has anyone encountered this?
[16:39:49] <velix> __adrian: So I think I'll just use include(), set $var in there and check if $var has been set in the main code.

[16:42:46] <__adrian> just curious, why are you avoiding the "config file" approach?
[16:43:03] <velix> __adrian: Is your "config file" approach documented somewhere?
[16:43:52] <Blondie101010> the config file could be any format you choose
[16:44:01] <__adrian> it's just a json (or some other format) file that you build a config object or array from and pass around as needed
[16:44:44] <Blondie101010> but it doesn't hide the secret any better than other solutions
[16:45:04] <velix> Sure. The "main code" is just the script, which includes the file.
[16:45:17] <__adrian> do you mean, "the global scope" ?
[16:45:18] <__adrian> ;)
[16:45:20] <Blondie101010> so to which the main script would have access
[16:45:56] <velix> Actually, I've done it the "config file" approach all the time. That's why I wondered, many users use dotenv now.

[16:48:21] <velix> Blondie101010: I could put it in vault, encrypted.
[16:48:33] <velix> Blondie101010: And share the unlocking keys for Vault with 3 other coders.
[16:48:39] <velix> So we need 3 people to unlock it on reboot ;)
[16:48:59] <Blondie101010> and your script would then need to know how to get the secret stuff from the vault and succeed in getting it... not safer at that point
[16:49:36] <Blondie101010> even if it needs 2 million keys, if you want it to do the work, you need to give it those keys
[16:50:30] <velix> Blondie101010: actually, I've got a setup, where each customer gets encrypted with a unique secret key stored in vault ;)
[16:50:57] <__adrian> velix: vault is for security at rest
[16:51:15] <__adrian> it doesn't help you at runtime, as blondie explained
[16:51:57] <velix> Sure! I totally got the point.
[16:52:12] <__adrian> there's a thing that many people don't think about: "90%+ of "secure code" is nothing more than code that works correctly, and on purpose."
[16:52:34] <__adrian> as relevent to this conversation, if someone's on your server, you're screwed.
[16:52:51] <velix> One website of our university had var_dump() in their website and it's in google cache now ;)
[16:52:51] <__adrian> the better thing to focus on is code that is deliberate, sane, robust
[16:52:56] <velix> Even in Google index, I've just checked :D
[16:53:09] <velix> But no secrets in there. But much other stuff.
[16:53:10] <__adrian> so people have a harder time getting onto your server in the first place.
[16:53:25] <velix> __adrian: sure. When they're on, it's worstcase.
[16:53:29] <velix> But it's hard to get in here, trust me.
[16:54:00] <velix> That's why I'm more concerned about the human error.
[16:54:05] <velix> like phpinfo() somewhere.
[16:54:30] <__adrian> point being that weird approaches like parsing values from a php file that you read as text create openings for more bugs, and therefore more attack vectors.
[16:55:48] <velix> __adrian: naah, I wouldn't have read php-code as text! But a dotfile!
[16:55:59] <velix> __adrian: that's exactly what those dotenv libs do.
[16:56:07] <velix> They read an INI-like file and parse it.
[16:56:15] <__adrian> "I wouldn't have read php-code as text"  just going by the thing you actually said  ;)
[16:56:17] <Blondie101010> velix:  if you're concerned about the traces that your devs leave, you have to start coaching them
[16:56:28] <Blondie101010> and do code reviews

[16:56:38] <__adrian> code review is great for security
[16:56:41] <velix> Not my job. I didn't want them, I didn't hire them.
[16:56:54] <__adrian> is security your job?
[16:57:16] <velix> Nope. But I don't want to hear anyone saying: "Why did you do it wrong".
[16:57:31] <__adrian> then you want to code review
[16:58:02] <velix> __adrian: I do. But what I really want is more then 24 hours a day :D
[16:58:06] <__adrian> it's all the same problem. even if you're only interested in cya, having a couple other folks that agreed your code was good to go accomplishes that

[19:11:17] <judah> I am testing it out. I am curious if the dependency injection system can handle it.
[19:13:29] *** Quits: Pixi (~Pixi@user/pixi) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[19:15:35] <TML> Their documentation has a list of things plugins can do, and it includes: Proceeding similarly when other modules are in progress of the same method in the same or predictable way.
[19:16:02] <TML> They also have a bunch of restrictions on what you CAN'T modify with a plugin
[19:16:35] <TML> ergo, it sounds to me like it should work as long as the plugin you're trying to modify allows for it
