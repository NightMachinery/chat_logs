[13:01:38] <p0indexter> low entropy
[13:01:44] <p0indexter> certianly
[13:02:18] <dispersed> low? isn't that surprising... intelligent activity correlates with higher entropy
[13:02:31] <dispersed> so consciousness is ... in a word ... not so smart?
[13:02:41] <mrig> Intellect seems somewhat less controversial, where perhaps it ought to be defined a little more clearly too, "I am smart because I buzzz and make honey, look ... honey and hexagons".
[13:02:51] <p0indexter> complexity correlates to high entropy?
[13:03:07] <p0indexter> life is not low entropy
[13:03:47] <p0indexter> i mean life is not high entropy
[13:04:03] <dispersed> indeed it isn't, probably is somewhere in between, maintaining a level of entropy

[13:18:41] <p0indexter> in an open system (perurbated) entropy decreases. in a closed system (non-perturbated) entropy increases
[13:20:52] <dispersed> so living organisms are seemingly closed systems which keep themselves open
[13:20:59] <dispersed> and conscious entities would be open-minded then
[13:21:27] <dispersed> controlled openness
[13:21:57] <I_Am_M00t> with a nice little port for input

[13:22:44] <p0indexter> enter rim shot
[13:24:43] <p0indexter> im saying, if information is neither created or destroyed then your thoughts defy that notion as does consciousness
[13:25:32] <p0indexter> at least for the creation side of the equation
[13:26:00] <inhahe__> I thought only open systems with an energy source have negative entropy. All closed systems necessarily have positive entropy because they can't have an overall energy source, but that doesn't mean all open systems have negentropy.
[13:27:21] <p0indexter> is a system is closed it isnt recieving energy form outside the system

[13:31:01] <p0indexter> well then the 2nd law of thermodynamics is wrong about information
[13:31:21] <I_Am_M00t> there are transformations which you cannot recover from
[13:31:43] <inhahe__> I_Am_M00t by that logic deleting a file implies the same thing. but information, i think, is not about digital information, which is abstract and only uses one aspect of the physical information of the system for a specific task
[13:31:50] <I_Am_M00t> if you burn a book that info is gone

[13:33:34] <inhahe__> information in conservation of information isn't about teh information printed in a book. it's more about teh arrangement of its subatomic particles, etc.

[13:34:12] <I_Am_M00t> lol
[13:34:34] <p0indexter> but it is a paradox and suggests a demon in the system decreasing entropy locally only associated with life and counscous life such as ourselvse add even more complexity
[13:34:51] <mrig> what about spiritual combustion and entropy?
[13:35:17] <mrig> Seems that this 'phenomenon' is responsible for much human creation.
[13:35:56] <inhahe__> p0indexter; you reaize the earth is not a closed system and that's why life is possible on it, right?

[13:41:35] <mrig> life is a compex form or path of the reflection of light from the surface of the planet.
[13:41:38] <inhahe__> as for consciousness, i think the only relevant thing here regarding conservation of information is our physical brains
[13:41:51] <mrig> not all though, some reflect the heat from the center of the earth.
[13:42:19] <inhahe__> conservation of information is a physical theory

[13:46:54] <mrig> no dhi is a word for the informaiton, it means more closely memory though.
[13:47:03] <dispersed> people forget that if information is conserved, then it isn't created either. so all the things you consider "news", aren't, in that sense
[13:47:36] <dispersed> so our sense of "information" is totally different from this "conserved information"
[13:47:40] <inhahe__> news is abstract, it's not the subject matter of conservation of information
[13:48:04] <dispersed> in fact, information like that is almost not information at all, it's more like the medium of information
[13:48:36] <p0indexter> dispersed: i think therefor im not
[13:48:44] <dispersed> exactly
[13:50:29] <dispersed> there is little use for multiple conserved things which reduce to the same thing: energy
[13:50:49] <dispersed> I guess you could call that conservation of meaning, IOW whatever you say, it makes no difference
[13:51:10] <ski> sometimes people distibguish between data and information, the latter being what you get when you interpret the former, imbue it with meaning
[13:51:46] <inhahe__> conservation of information has nothing to do with meaning as we normally think of it, imo

[13:54:22] <inhahe__> and when DNA unravels or disintegrates, information isn't lost in the sense of conservation of information, because it's not about abstract information
[13:54:44] <inhahe__> the molecules and their information are still there
[13:54:54] <ski> mrig : makes one wonder how Sanskrit was formed
[13:55:15] <mrig> when consepts are this fundamental, it is nonsensical to look for label like translations.

[14:26:24] <mrig> I think that grace can be so fun to dance with that one would not see the logic in pursuing anything else.
[14:26:46] <inhahe__> Grace is hard to come by
[14:27:08] <inhahe__> And I wonder, even if you find it, can you easily lose it?
[14:27:31] <mrig> I don't think that it is an object, so there is nothing to loose.
[14:27:55] <mrig> ever present, just that it is very hard to see when oneself gets in the way.
[14:28:07] <p0indexter> grace is a state of mind?
[14:28:14] <mrig> So very hard to get over oneself.
[14:28:29] <inhahe__> You can 'lose' a state of being though
[14:28:29] <mrig> state of universal mind and an awareness of that perhaps?
[14:28:39] <inhahe__> or an awareness
[14:28:40] <p0indexter> what are the attributes of grace
[14:28:58] <mrig> so mind yes but not within ones own mind, interfaced with everything.
[14:29:25] <inhahe__> it's too easy and default to let oneself get in the way, i guess
[14:29:45] <inhahe__> maybe it's the way the world conditions us

[14:31:35] <inhahe__> i guess standing for justice can get you into a lot of trouble
[14:31:39] <p0indexter> the most facinating version of the double slit eperiment is the delayed choice quantum eraser

[17:33:25] <p0indexter> the organization is something to consider. do you want code from an org you know nothing about on your device. some distros have little or no oversight aof maintainers

[23:03:28] <brownorange> i have a new hot take on the incompleteness theorem
[23:04:40] <brownorange> For a liar sentence to be true, math would need to be inconsistent and the sentence false. In all other cases, the liar sentence is false anyway.
[23:04:47] <brownorange> sigh
[23:05:13] <brownorange> (a <-> !(b -> a)) is only true when a,b are false.
[23:07:55] <brownorange> in other words if you believe math is consistent, the liar sentence is false.
[23:08:24] <brownorange> are we agreed?
[23:10:51] <brownorange> good, next i'd like to show that the liar sentence is actually provably false. not just false.
[23:12:05] <brownorange> one sec. checking my notebooks
[23:12:47] <brownorange> ok so you can instantiate a modus ponens like formula. (T /\ (T -> a) ) -> a
[23:14:35] <brownorange> trippy. you could replace 'a' with anything and prove 'a'. that can't be right...
[23:16:28] <brownorange> nope it's right. so replace 'a' with the liar sentence. now the liar sentence is provable if it is true.
