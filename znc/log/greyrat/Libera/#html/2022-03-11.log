[16:48:32] <SanchoPanza> Hi I just started learning html and css . I want some projects to read the source code . may u help me?
[16:50:01] <SanchoPanza> Dudes!
[16:50:41] <stenno> your question doesnt make sense]
[16:51:37] <SanchoPanza> What projects are good for a beginner like me 
[16:52:00] <SanchoPanza> to read their source code and change them 
[16:52:56] <stenno> ah
[16:53:19] <stenno> i don't think it makes sense to read any projects really
[16:53:33] <stenno> apart from inspiration
[16:53:54] <SanchoPanza> Yes inspiration 
[16:54:19] <SanchoPanza> Do you have any suggestion ?
[16:54:39] <stenno> can't think of anything outstanding right now..
[16:55:21] <SanchoPanza> Thanks

[17:06:12] <nbjoerg> most websites are overcomplicated
[17:06:25] <nbjoerg> and finding good html/css-only templates is hard...
