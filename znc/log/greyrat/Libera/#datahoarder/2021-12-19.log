[00:29:25] <ThePendulum> probably haven't used my bike in over a decade, remember trying to ride it half a mile to school and having to get off and walk halfway through...
[00:29:37] <ThePendulum> did that for a few months before just always walking heh
[00:31:23] <skye0> Ironic for someone who lives in a country where the very road laws protect cyclists, but yeah, it's convenient you live quite close
[00:33:33] <ThePendulum> I'm still not sure if this Not Just Bikes channel is propaganda
[00:35:23] <skye0> most likely. Sure, manufacturing bikes does emit carbon but the very products don't, until some manufacturers for cars go completely electric, but even then I'm not sure how they recycle batteries
[00:36:04] <ThePendulum> I also imagine manufacturing a car emits more carbon than manufacturing a bike
[00:36:14] <skye0> yup
[00:36:24] <ThePendulum> batteries are indeed the big gotcha atm
[00:36:50] <ThePendulum> think I remember reading even batteries with cobalt in them have less cobalt than a combustion engine
[00:37:01] <ThePendulum> but then they still need to go somewhere
[00:37:03] <skye0> Still gonna need to try and process this trauma - if they actually had knives then I'd be fucked, I'm lucky those idiots were all talk for now, but considering I heard a young woman talk about stabbing someone at a bank, and considering I live in the UK, knife crime is a concern.
[00:37:12] <rawktucc> im tempted to bike across the netherlands
[00:37:19] <rawktucc> it seems like the perfect place to do so with all their routes
[00:37:21] <skye0> Can't trust the cops to always be just, as with Sarah Everard
[00:38:42] <skye0> ThePendulum: If cobalt from batteries could be made less toxic for consumption or synthesis into other things, it could perhaps help with vegan diets? I hear cobalt, processed by cow gut bacteria to create vitamin B12, is lacking with vegans
[00:39:30] <rawktucc> 0_0
[00:39:38] <rawktucc> im not eating a battery!
[00:39:42] <ThePendulum> I see, I'm not sure if that's more convenient than B12 supplements
[00:39:55] <ThePendulum> rawktucc: well you're eating anti freeze and drinking nuclear reactor coolant
[00:40:06] <rawktucc> NOOOO
[00:40:09] <rawktucc> in what foods?
[00:40:33] <ThePendulum> almost everything, lol
[00:40:44] <skye0> They used to put nukes in food in the first half of the 20th century, thinking they were healthy

[00:59:15] <skye0> I just need to learn how to enjoy vegetables and water more, to lose weight and save the earth
[01:01:32] <rawktucc> i drink at least 8 cups a day of water
[01:01:35] <rawktucc> the vegetables i like but
[01:01:44] <rawktucc> im eating super processed chips rn so im no saint
[01:02:06] <skye0> I am bad with regularly drinking water
[01:02:21] <skye0> I just never really cook for myself 
[01:02:24] <rawktucc> get yourself a cup on desk, and a glass water jug thing
[01:02:52] <skye0> I tend to fill my tables with shit because I have so much stuff I guess 
[01:02:54] <rawktucc> the veggies, you should try to eat snacky stuff like baby carrots, celery, cooked red beets, pepper slices, mini tomatoes
[01:04:00] <rawktucc> when eating the food feels less like a chore "to eat it", and more like a snack "because I want one", you eat it or something
[01:05:08] <skye0> I find vegetables more tasty when mixed with something, like falafels
[01:05:26] <rawktucc> yaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[01:05:32] <rawktucc> falafels are great
[01:05:39] <rawktucc> as is hummus by close association
[01:05:54] <rawktucc> oh and "garlic sauce" as it's called in canadian shawarma places
[01:07:17] *** Quits: xet7 (~xet7@user/xet7) (Remote host closed the connection)
[01:08:03] <ThePendulum> how big are your cups
[01:08:09] <ThePendulum> for water that is
[01:08:14] <ThePendulum> I'm not that bold
[01:08:24] <skye0> 250ml or so, got one that's 450ml though
[01:09:28] <skye0> Only want to eat highly processed meat since I'm squeamish about preparing meat myself, and I feel like I could do just fine with a vegetarian diet, bar the absence of meat
[01:10:02] <ThePendulum> a vegetarian diet but with the meat?
[01:10:42] <ThePendulum> I think a lot of the vegetarian campaigns are hitting the wrong angles by showing these horrific pictures of slaughtered animals
[01:11:47] <skye0> no. I'll be almost practically trying to become a vegetarian or vegan (spoiled dairy is not great), but I'll miss having meat if I did. Only want to ditch meat to save money - don't want to handle raw meat myself, and processed meat is always more expensive or less value for money
[01:11:58] <ThePendulum> most people don't really fully accept they are sentient beings that can suffer, so it's just kind of gross, not emotionally upsetting
[01:12:10] <ThePendulum> additionally it doesn't offer a solution, just "you're doing something wrong and you should feel bad"
[01:12:13] <ThePendulum> people don't want to feel bad
[01:12:16] <ThePendulum> so they stop listening to you
[01:13:02] <ThePendulum> I think it's more effective to show people vegetarian/vegan food is so much more than some lettuce and a tomato, and just show and serve better dishes in restaurants and cooking shows
[01:13:27] <rawktucc> i admit I do cook some of those fake vegan food alternatives in stores
[01:13:33] <rawktucc> like fake sausage or patties
[01:13:38] <skye0> Encountered colleagues at work who preferred the vegan burgers at Burger King simply because they tasted better
[01:13:40] <rawktucc> it's too convenient sometimes
[01:14:00] <ThePendulum> they're getting better thankfully, but I think vegan food can be really good even without meat substitutes
[01:14:13] <skye0> It is, but they're also as good for your money as chicken tendies
[01:14:19] *** Joins: xet7 (~xet7@user/xet7)
[01:14:22] <ThePendulum> yeah if you don't go in expecting it to taste like meat, they might as well taste better in their own right
[01:15:42] <ThePendulum> the whole "be a man and throw some meat on the grill" thing is hilarious lol

[01:17:06] <ThePendulum> mate of mine thought about buying some chain mail to get to his uni in manchester
[01:17:20] <ThePendulum> the situation in the uk seems to be excellent atm
[01:18:37] <rawktucc> is that sarcasm
[01:20:13] <skye0> rawktucc: I have puffy coat. A bit smol though, and has a few tears
[01:20:34] <ThePendulum> the excellent situation was, the chain mail wasn't
[01:20:43] <ThePendulum> I mean I do think it's a bit of an overreaction on his part
[01:20:57] <skye0> ThePendulum: I live near London, not saying. Don't think the kids who mugged me were associated with gangs but proximity could affect stuff

[01:23:45] <Hydragyrum> how much space does it take to archive reddit?
[01:23:51] <rawktucc> ThePendulum, wdym porn empite
[01:23:59] <rawktucc> reddit has a ton of nsfw stuff i doubt could be found elsewhere
[01:24:00] * Hydragyrum heads to shucks.top to find more space to fit reddit on
[01:24:04] <rawktucc> how do you even organize
[01:24:04] <ThePendulum> like an out of hand alt account and a sub
[01:24:10] <ThePendulum> yeah that's what I'm worried about
[01:24:10] <rawktucc> ah
[01:24:21] <rawktucc> nsfw411 has so many weird good niches
[01:24:26] <ThePendulum> Hydragyrum: just the posts or all the actual content associated with the links?
[01:24:29] <rawktucc> it's annoying trying to find that content elsewhere
[01:24:48] <rawktucc> also tumblr losing nsfw didn't kill it as much as people thing tbh
[01:24:52] <rawktucc> im on there every day for the memes
[01:24:54] <Hydragyrum> ThePendulum: everything that'd be stored from reddit servers ig
[01:25:06] <Hydragyrum> externally linked content eh
[01:25:11] <skye0> Gonna need another place to discuss piracy more freely. Thankfully, if I ever use Reddit, it's to shitpost
[01:25:12] <ThePendulum> I guess that became more expensive in recent years when i.reddit became a hting
[01:25:25] <rawktucc> skye0, there is lemmy.ml
[01:25:58] <rawktucc> https://lemmy.ml/c/piracy
[01:26:17] <rawktucc> but i do not advocate piracy because of complicated reasons
[01:26:18] <skye0> Iffy on that, it has tankies. May explore the seedbox community for my piracy needs, but I don't have the hardware for seedbox
[01:26:29] <rawktucc> lemmygrad has tankies but lemmy is more left leaning

[01:28:08] <ThePendulum> feel free to use and contribute to ripunzel, lol
[01:28:19] <rawktucc> US based, single location for data storage, no known backups, also in an area that's on a fault line
[01:28:24] <rawktucc> imagine a huge earthquake in SF
[01:28:39] <rawktucc> i know of https://github.com/p-ranav/saveddit
[01:28:47] <rawktucc> what is ripunzel
[01:29:05] <rawktucc> there's another tool for archiving imgur images based on subreddits
[01:29:09] <ThePendulum> I tried a bunch of those tools and what they all had in common is that they just dumped the data on one big pile like "5 - eiowjf234.jpg"
[01:29:14] <ThePendulum> https://gitea.unknown.name/DebaucheryLibrarian/ripunzel/
[01:29:33] <rawktucc> oh there's one other tool I recall that actually archived entire subreddits
[01:29:37] <ThePendulum> the main focus of ripunzel was to have a fully configurable filename template where you can put in timestamps, post titles, etc.
[01:29:37] <rawktucc> but had no option to append
[01:29:41] <rawktucc> so you'd just be overriting existing shit
[01:29:50] <rawktucc> ah this is for reddit users
[01:29:50] <rawktucc> :(
[01:29:59] <ThePendulum> ripunzel2 does subreddits and is meant to be expanded to youtube and broader, but it's not very complete
[01:30:10] <ThePendulum> the actual saving mechanics are a WIP
[01:30:22] <rawktucc> https://github.com/p-ranav/saveddit
[01:30:34] <ThePendulum> ripunzel1 works but is very reddit-centric, it can fetch content from supported hosts via --direct though
[01:30:37] <rawktucc> media downloader
[01:30:40] <rawktucc> but i want to archive posts and comments
[01:30:48] <rawktucc> not sure which tool is best for that
[01:31:05] <ThePendulum> seems saveddit has some comment support
[01:31:14] <ThePendulum> ripunzel did at one point but I don't remember what state I left it in
[01:31:21] <rawktucc> https://github.com/aliparlakci/bulk-downloader-for-reddit
[01:32:02] <rawktucc> "The archive command will download the submission data itself and store it, such as the submission details, upvotes, text, statistics, as and all the comments on that submission."
[01:33:42] <rawktucc> i guess archivebox would also work to download individual reddit posts

[07:47:38] <djangoloser> also are all libera server connected to matrix element?
[07:48:16] <Hydragyrum> the way IRC works, messages sent to the channel are relayed by the server out to all connected clients, and that's it -- which is why a lot of people use bouncers and always-online clients on VPSes that they attach to with screen or tmux etc.
