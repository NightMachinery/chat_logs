[10:56:26] <Arya[m]> ya
[10:56:42] <Arya[m]> it takes less resources to setup something like a private federation of matrix 
[10:57:05] <Arya[m]> even the french government made their new messaging app based on matrix
[11:41:01] <gtlsgamr> Test
[12:03:12] <Arya[m]> i recieved the msg
[12:03:18] <Arya[m]> did the irc bridge die or something

[19:44:18] <ak> the bridge is dead?
[19:44:50] <Arya[m]> the bridhe died
[19:45:03] <Arya[m]> seems like it died one way again
[19:45:10] <Arya[m]> irc -> matrix doesnt work
[19:45:13] <Arya[m]> matrix -> irc works
[19:50:05] <Arya[m]> it takes about 5 min for irc message to reach matrix
[19:50:07] <ak> test again

[20:35:48] <gtlsgamr> Hey Arya[m] I will look at it today and merge it if it is cool
[20:35:59] <Arya[m]> ok
