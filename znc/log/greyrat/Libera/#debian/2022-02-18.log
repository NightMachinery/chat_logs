[01:17:34] <greycat> If it's a server or a regular desktop box, you can still use interfaces(5).  If it's a laptop, and especially since you appear to use GNOME, network-manager would be the normal thing.
[01:17:51] <greycat> !nodm
[01:17:51] <dpkg> In systemd, "systemctl set-default multi-user.target", or remove the DM package(s) with "aptitude remove gdm3 kdm lightdm lxdm nodm sddm slim wdm xdm".  "echo false >/etc/X11/default-display-manager" will also disable the DM, or just hit ctrl-alt-fN to get to a console.  nodm is the name of a minimal/automatic display manager (https://github.com/spanezz/nodm).

[01:35:31] <acu> Khepra: it seem somehow complicated and not human friendly
[01:35:38] <Khepra> acu: we use debootstrap with a custom script that primes SaltStack minion to take over. That is not 100% fully automatable as it requires a rescue environment to boot from which debootstrap is launched.
[01:35:55] <acu> I want to have a system installed manually and generate a script that will install the same
[01:36:48] <Khepra> still it's close enough, you just need to start the rescue system manually, and launch the debootstrapper script
[01:37:51] <acu> I see - I am thinking to have the base installed somehow automatically and in the worst scenario after the base install use ansible
[01:38:03] <karlpinc> Psi-Jack: Dunno.  Maybe another file has a mis-placed quote or something that's messing with the parser?  You could also check bugs.debian.org.

[06:51:22] <ke4nhw> Hi all. I'm in the position where I have to consider a new distribution. I need something that is stable, with a decent life cycle to it, can function as both a workstation and a server (server with gui), with kvm for additional virtual servers. Oh, and something I don't have to steal the entire US and European gold reserve to afford.
[06:51:53] <ke4nhw> As of right now I have been given budget allocations for: FREE
[06:52:33] <greycat> You are asking in #debian.  We will say Debian.  If you want an unbiased answer, don't ask in a distribution's support channel.
[06:52:47] <sney> I've been using debian for that use case for 15ish years, and you're already here, so you probably have already determined that it may work for that
[06:52:58] <sney> what is your real question? what's the sticking point
[06:53:04] <ke4nhw> Also, I will be using this in a small business production environment, so the license agreement has to allow for use in a business
[06:53:26] *** Joins: ddsys (~ddsys@user/ddsys)
[06:54:01] <sney> licenses for software in main allow for that, some stuff in contrib/non-free may not, you can read more in http://wiki.debian.org/DFSGLicenses
[06:54:29] <ke4nhw> The short of it, can Debian be used free in a business environment, and is it capable of: workstation, servers, server with gui, and kvm? If so, what is the standard life cycle?
[06:54:51] *** Joins: brm_ (~brm@182.253.209.150)
[06:55:55] <sney> yes, and 5 years plus.
[06:56:09] <sney> ~2 years fully supported as stable, ~2 years as oldstable (limited security support and sometimes patches for popular packages), then LTS.
[06:56:10] <sney> !lts
[06:56:11] <dpkg> Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years.  Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian security team, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies.  Ask me about <jessie-lts> and <stretch-lts> and see https://wiki.debian.org/LTS for more information.  #debian-lts on irc.oftc.net.
[06:59:30] <ke4nhw> Okay, it'll take me some time to dig through the legal pages, but for most cases debian itself is free and legal to use in a business, then it just comes down to the services, such as apache, nginx, librenms, etc as to whether their specific product must be purchased or can be used freely?
[06:59:58] <ke4nhw> That'll give me a starting point to determine if I want to consider this as one of my considerations.
[07:00:37] <greycat> As you were already told: every package in "main" may be used freely in businesses and all other ventures.
[07:01:03] <sney> packages you can install via apt from debian main can be used freely and legally in businesses, or by criminals, or by universities, or whatever. the DFSG and the licenses considered to be DFSG "free" don't concern who the end user is or why they are using the software.
[07:02:06] <ke4nhw> Okay, that's what I needed to know, and is the very reason I am having to consider other distributions.
[07:02:49] <sney> that includes apache and nginx, certainly. librenms doesn't seem to be in debian, but it is a gpl application, so same answer
[07:03:26] <ke4nhw> Hmm, debian doesn't have Libre products, or just not LibreNMS?
[07:03:38] <sney> not every application is packaged in debian
[07:04:09] <ke4nhw> Yep, another thing for me to consider as well, so I can look at another NMS suite
[07:04:29] <sney> I see 347 packages with names that start with "libre" here on bookworm
[07:04:33] <ke4nhw> OpenNMS, Zabbix, etc
[07:04:38] <sney> ,bug wnpp librenms
[07:04:39] <judd> Sorry, no wnpp bugs were found.
[07:04:59] <greycat> OK, I'll bite.  What is "NMS" in this context?  Google is not giving me relevant results.
[07:05:07] <sney> monitoring suite
[07:05:12] <ke4nhw> Network Management Suite
[07:05:17] <sney> snmp stuff
[07:05:19] <greycat> I doubt you're looking for Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome or No Man's Sky.
[07:05:21] <ke4nhw> yep

[07:10:26] <ke4nhw> Yep, gonna need NMS products, gonna need IDS products, kvm for virtualization is a must (and its gui, virt-manager or whatever it's named in debian), gonna need squid proxy, and BIND. Of course OpenVPN (that's a standard) and I'd really like if Samba is available as well. with a list like this, I'm only considering the big names that come highly recommended (and debian comes highly recommended)

[07:12:21] <ke4nhw> Oh wow package manager is seriously going to be different than what I have always known
[07:12:37] <sney> but people use debian all the time in environments like you describe, and so the vast majority of what you're talking about will be fine out of the box.
[07:13:04] <ke4nhw> Awesome
[07:13:43] <ke4nhw> Looks like I'm going to need some serious documentation for debian though, I've only ever used redhat distributions

[07:16:46] *** Joins: brm_ (~brm@182.253.209.150)
[07:16:48] <sney> it's also good to remember that debian is an integration project (I think redhat is too), so most packages are left unmodified from upstream except where necessary. your existing habits for nginx or SQL servers or DNS will be basically unchanged coming from a rpm distro.
[07:17:18] <ke4nhw> Okay, I can be reading on this during the vm install. I take it that everything: syntax, commands, locations of config files, firewall package, everything, is different than redhat distros? If so I'll need to read the docs before I can even get off the ground.
[07:18:25] <sney> syntax is generally the same (bash is bash), commands are basically the same (bash is bash...), config files are located in /etc but some subdirs may be different, debian doesn't ship a firewall,
[07:18:58] <sney> if you're familiar with using redhat in production it'll probably take you a day to get a feel for using debian
[07:18:59] <ke4nhw> Okay, thing is, his system doesn't even exist yet, this is a ground up. I'm going on what packages I know he'll need, so I can tell if I even spin up a distro for testing to determine if that's what he will benefit from using.
[07:19:15] <ke4nhw> no firewall?
[07:19:27] *** Quits: greycat (~greg@209.142.155.49) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[07:19:43] <sney> debian is intended to be universal. many use cases for individual systems don't call for a firewall. and there are many options for netfilter administration.
[07:19:46] <sney> you want one, you install it
[07:20:47] <ke4nhw> yep I'm used to using redhat. As for firewalls, I prefer using iptables, which is netfilter
[07:21:11] *** Quits: SpeakerToMeat (~Speaker@user/speakertomeat) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[07:21:29] <ke4nhw> Old habit, I don't run any system without a firewall, unless it's airgapped.
[07:21:31] *** Joins: greycat (~greg@209.142.155.49)
[07:21:31] <sney> netfilter themselves are trying to get everyone to switch to nftables. and then there's stuff like ufw... it's all available via apt, pick the one you want and install it
[07:23:00] <ke4nhw> haven't come across nftables except in documentation yet, with redhat it's either iptables or firewalld, which works (very poorly I might add) as a frontend for iptables.
[07:23:45] <ke4nhw> iptables is my fave. highly configurable, very precise configuring.
[07:23:57] <sney> I think the package for iptables in debian 11 is just a wrapper for nftables. that'll probably be around for a long time

[07:25:09] <ke4nhw> I'll download a Debian iso for installation. You said there's a LTS? Should I look for a Debian LTS iso or similar?
[07:25:39] <ke4nhw> Because LTS cycles would be ideal. I don't want to do hard upgrades every six months lol
[07:25:41] <greycat> LTS is what happens to EVERY release after a few years.
[07:25:43] <sney> lts is applied to the package repository later
[07:25:48] <sney> you just want a stable iso
[07:27:31] <sney> debian doesn't have the weird quarterly versioning thing that ubuntu likes. right now we're on debian 11, any debian 11 iso will give you a vm that'll be supported for as long as debian 11 gets support. with elts that could be 6 years from now
[07:27:34] <greycat> Debian's releases occur every 2-3 years (typically closer to 2), and each one is supported for 5 years from its release date.  The last part of that 5-year period is LTS support, meaning it's handled by a separate, smaller team.
[07:29:14] <ke4nhw> Okay, so the iso creates a vm of its own, or are you referring to the fact that I'm going to be installing it as a vm?
[07:29:24] *** Quits: cdown (~cdown@188.214.11.14) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[07:30:00] <sney> the latter

[07:33:17] <sney> using smaller installers is better unless you'll be away from the internet for a long time. packages are updated individually, so your large dvd set (or giant blu-ray iso) could be outdated p quickly

[07:34:43] <trench> ke4nhw: should work fine
[07:34:48] <sney> yeah, and there's stuff like apt-cacher-ng if you're going to update a lot of systems over 1 connection and don't want too many redundant downloads
[07:35:08] <trench> you can mount the cd/dvd as a mirror too

[07:42:12] <greycat> Even if you install from DVD-1, it may still download packages from the mirrors, either because you selected something that's not on the DVD-1 image, or because a security update has been released for the package after the DVD-1 image was created.
[07:44:06] <ke4nhw> Okay, I'll give that a go, download the dvd for later if I happen to need it. Thank y'all for the info, I think at this point it's time to get cranking. Oh, every OS is different, and with this being a completely new OS for me, I'd rather be awake for the whole install. How long does a typical install (with a few extra packages) take to complete on a decent system?
[07:44:16] <ke4nhw> I'll be allocating it ample resources.
[07:44:55] <dvs> It depends what packages you install
[07:45:00] <sney> not long though
[07:45:08] <sney> speed of download and speed of disk i/o'

[19:50:19] <rootkea> Hello! I have 2 separate machines. One running Debian (Dell machine) and another Ubuntu (HP machine). Unfortunately, the Debian machine died (motherboard issue). Now, I am planning to put its HDD (with Debian on it) in HP box as I want to use Debian and not Ubuntu.
[19:50:36] <rootkea> The issue is that the Debian HDD has non-free drivers as per Dell machine configuration so when I'll put that in HP machine, what new drivers (specific to HP machine) will I need to install? Can I use currently running Ubuntu to get the list of those packages? Thanks!

[19:53:50] <rootkea> jelly, I just don't want to end up with no HP specific drivers with my Debian from Dell machine...
[19:54:50] <jelly> if you can plug in wired ethernet temporarily you'll be able to get internet access that way and install any missing bits
[19:55:00] <Poster> you could install debian where ubuntu currently exists, then compare dpkg -l output between the two and see if any firmware, etc differences exist

[19:56:00] <Poster> I mean replace the Ubuntu install on the HP with debian

[20:03:02] <rootkea> Poster, that's the plan! But I've hold off till now just to make sure I don't miss any HP-specific driver...
[20:03:04] <jelly> rootkea, you usually already have the drivers.  You might be missing FIRMWARE however.
[20:04:14] <jelly> probably not worth worrying about it in advance, just have a live linux image at hand if you have to fix things
[20:04:16] <Poster> you could try researching the specific model HP and Debian to see if others had to do anything specific, but I think the generic kernel will cover most situations, but as jelly noted there may be missing firmware, but that should be apparent if something isn't working (video, network, sound)
[20:04:46] <rootkea> jelly, ah, okay. So it would be nice to get the list of firmware packages I gotta install on Debian after the swap to HP machine. Or at least a way for running Debian to detect and ask for missing firmware packages...

[20:18:51] <rootkea> I see. Makes sense to not solely depend on the external package install...
[20:19:15] <jelly> windows did not even ship microcode updates until recently, users were expected to apply them via BIOS fw updates
[20:19:16] <sussudio> rootkea: you can just install microcode-intel on the amd machine and vice versa. it won't do anything if the cpu doesn't match.
