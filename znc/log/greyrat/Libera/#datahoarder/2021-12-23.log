[00:10:09] <rmmh> ,bang
[00:10:09] <unfinity> rmmh you shot a duck in 49.476 seconds! You have killed 122 ducks in #datahoarder.
[00:11:51] <skye0> ,bef
[00:11:51] <unfinity> You tried befriending a non-existent duck. That's freaking creepy.
[00:12:12] <skye0> Ah
[00:12:37] <skye0> I might just be too annoying. Got a full time job at least so I may be able to start hoarding soon, for real this time
[00:17:10] <rawktucc> skye0, what do you film your footage too?
[00:17:17] <rawktucc> you should consider putting it on b2 or scaleway
[00:28:43] <skye0> rawktucc: hopefully a montage but I still suck at games and I just store it at medal.tv, since I don't care about losing those as much as I do crap from YT.
[00:29:09] <rawktucc> ah ok, if it's a no care kinda content then i mean... idk
[00:29:18] <rawktucc> i meant more what video format do you save to
[00:29:27] <skye0> If my work situation doesn't fuck up or gets better I'll consider b2 ASAP. Got to migrate from Gmail and get texts from my KaiOS phone too.
[00:29:38] <skye0> rawktucc: mp4, mkv, webm
[00:29:41] <rawktucc> i record mine to ffmpegv1 because it's lossless, but the videos are huge
[00:29:50] <rawktucc> that all sounds like x264 :P
[00:30:32] <skye0> I just use what nvidia, amd or medal use. amd has h265 but is a bit fucky on discord
[00:30:38] <rawktucc> i record a lot of my tf2 footage because tf2 is wild
[00:30:57] <skye0> Medal is OK. To me it just seems like TikTok for gamers
[00:31:07] <rawktucc> https://litter.catbox.moe/mmvafe.mp4 the invincible horse
[00:31:12] <skye0> I didn't want to use YT for anything but scraping others' videos
[00:31:49] <rawktucc> https://www.ebay.ca/itm/162486733617 damn M-DISC is even more expensive than 128GB Blurays...
[00:32:07] <skye0> Been crazy over bf2042, specifically Battlefield Portal
[00:32:28] <rawktucc> the new or old
[00:32:36] <rawktucc> i remember playiung old 2042 and battlefield 2
[00:32:37] <rawktucc> loved those
[00:32:42] <skye0> new
[00:32:45] <rawktucc> :(
[00:32:51] <skye0> Old was bf2142
[00:33:18] <rawktucc> ohh
[00:33:23] <skye0> I just want a CoD replacement. Fuck the release schedule, Activision and Blizzard
[00:33:41] <rawktucc> is there a FOSS CoD replacement?
[00:34:02] <skye0> not really. Maybe Vengeance?
[00:34:13] <skye0> but that's likely dead

[00:34:50] <skye0> I want run and gun. Started Doom Eternal on nightmare but I don't want to be stressed. Don't get me started on trying to take out the Marauder without changing to Easy mode
[00:35:27] <joepie91> rawktucc: M-DISC is very questionable for bluray
[00:35:53] <joepie91> it's my understanding that disc rot is caused by the organic dyes used in regular CDs/DVDs, and M-DISC accomplishes its (claimed) durability by using inorganic dye
[00:35:57] <rawktucc> how so? what about compared to those 128GB Blurays
[00:36:02] <joepie91> but as I understand it, blu-ray discs use inorganic dye by default
[00:36:03] <rawktucc> oh
[00:36:23] <rawktucc> dont m-discs have some kind of extra features like temperature control?
[00:36:25] <joepie91> so M-DISC makes sense for CD/DVD (assuming its technical claims hold up) but for BR it's much much shakier
[00:36:35] <joepie91> 'temperature control' in what sense?
[00:37:02] <joepie91> (there's a looooot of marketing horseshit around M-DISC so it's important to be precise :p)
[00:37:14] <rawktucc> oh idk, just making stuff up maybe lol

[00:48:34] <skye0> i kind of want to talk to tammy and tell her about me having work in a hospital, but it's not turned out as i hoped for me. well, it's boring i guess

[00:51:28] <skye0> inbf4 cult of steam. don't really give a shit, know how to make a game (it's complicated but still doable to a standard i can appreciate unlike with music and TV)
[00:54:52] <rawktucc> nah I do not like steam
[00:55:13] <rawktucc> it's a DRM system first and foremost, so I don't like it. that said I like a lot of what it offers, like it's CDN, multiplayer, storefront, updates, etc
[00:55:27] <skye0> prefer gog myself. ideally would make my own game but i'd rather move out first before i can even do that
[00:55:29] <rawktucc> fossilize and proton for Linux windows gaming is cool but sadly somewhat proprietary
[00:55:37] <rawktucc> i prefer itch.io, GOG also has DRM now in a way
[00:55:50] <rawktucc> i see newer GOG releases constantly trying to ping some GOG check URL in my DNS blocklist
[00:55:53] <rawktucc> so I consider that DRM
[00:56:01] <rawktucc> spyware maybe
[00:56:19] <skye0> yup, it's a bit weird with GOG
[00:56:27] <skye0> itch.io is still good
[00:56:30] <rawktucc> also, their linux support is pretty subpar

[00:56:47] <rawktucc> itch is great but yeah limited per the individual dev for what's delivered, and updates/delivery is kinda wonky
[00:56:52] <skye0> again, ideal solution for me is either that or create my own game. i choose the latter because there's not many experiences i want out there regarding games
[00:56:57] *** Joins: CombatVet (~c4@user/combatvet)
[00:57:50] <skye0> would like something like sims 4 or cod but i'm never gonna realistically recreate the sims games, and no one else is making a cod clone (most attribute it to the need for a large multiplayer community or whatever)
[00:58:06] <rawktucc> ahh
[00:58:17] <rawktucc> interesting insights!
[00:58:46] <skye0> there's lots of indie shooters out there but none of them want to recreate the cod experience, even the singleplayer experience
[00:59:21] <skye0> most want to either revive rainbow six (before siege) or swat, some force co-op, and the closest i can get to a cod experience are literal doom clones that copy the art style and graphics of early 90s shooters
[01:00:05] <skye0> also just bought fh5. it might collect dust simply because i'm not so deep into racing games, and i'm slightly worried it won't run very well on my system
[01:02:03] <skye0> still don't know how i'd feel about buying mafia 3. the cool muscle cars and graphics attract me to it. usually not a fan of historical games too

[01:14:54] <skye0> and besides one more game which i might get some other time, that's all the games i want for now
