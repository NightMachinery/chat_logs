[02:04:45] <PonyBlocks> hi
[02:05:11] <PonyBlocks> i dont get this docker stuff.
[02:05:40] <PonyBlocks> can the dockerfile, and build scrip be in whatever folder on the computer?
[02:06:24] <Habbie> if the things they need are in or under that folder, then generally, yes
[02:06:56] <tabakhase> PonyBlocks technically nwo yes, but kinda no - and i dont think thats your actual question =)  ((this also changed some docker versions ago))
[02:07:05] <tabakhase> *now
[02:07:08] <PonyBlocks> well
[02:08:05] <PonyBlocks> only thing stopping me from using docker is i cant figure out where to start. okey i can pull an os, but i cant build no apps on it. becuse i dont know where on the computer the container is stuck and run stuff from
[02:08:40] <PonyBlocks> and all guides is just make dockerfile, script, run docker. but never explain where the dockerfile is supposed to be
[02:08:56] <PonyBlocks> on desktop or home folder etc. 
[02:09:09] <tabakhase> PonyBlocks the best start is rly to "not build any images yourself" for now... - but "you replace apt-get with the docker hub" - build some tooling, some CI pipeline stuff to practice, THEN worry about "dockerizing your application"
[02:09:33] <PonyBlocks> well tbh i cant build shit with docker
[02:09:36] <tabakhase> the dockerfile doesnt matter to the image once its build, but you usually pack them into the git repo of your project or whatever
[02:09:39] <PonyBlocks> becuse its not even explained
[02:09:52] <PonyBlocks> where to start with the dockerfile on local host machine
[02:11:04] <tabakhase> if you go all the way down, "dockerD doesnt even get a dockerfile", but your commandline tool "docker" reads the file and sends it over the the background process :P ((so one can even build "on a remote host" using a ssh tunnel or such for example))
[02:12:21] <PonyBlocks> but hey you seem to not understand my issue
[02:13:06] <tabakhase> that may very well be correct, so try from a step further back, "what are you trying todo"?
[02:13:44] <PonyBlocks> i would be "easy" to use docker, if it was explained from a "begginers" perspective, File location on host machine, where to put the dockerfile, github, etc 
[02:14:10] <PonyBlocks> ive tried to read from start of docker documentation but its boring af
[02:14:11] <PonyBlocks> tbh
[02:14:28] <PonyBlocks> just plain boring to much unessesary text and hard to get to the point
[02:14:33] <tabakhase> > [23:39:36] <tabakhase> the dockerfile doesnt matter to the image once its build, but you usually pack them into the git repo of your project or whatever
[02:15:19] <PonyBlocks> falling asleep when im reading docker documentation and watch the videos is a pain, they so much talking so little action. and they forget the plain basic info u need before doing all the stuff
[02:15:39] <tabakhase> and i agree that the tut is pretty bad, whats not helped by docker having no real learning "curve" - its more steps and headbanging until it clicks, its a few different things and concepts one kinda needs to "understand at the same time" - but its certainly doable and worth it ;-)
[02:16:21] <PonyBlocks> tbh, ive tried for many weeks to use docker but i have given up on it..
[02:17:10] <kneitukas> well it seems that you didn't, since you're still looking for answers :)
[02:17:23] <tabakhase> hence the idea to "first build some tooling" what will give you actual problems to solve/google/ask about -- "where to put dockerfiles" isnt anserable in itself... - but a "where do i put the dockerfile for my website" is a simple "right into its root-folder =)"
[02:18:07] <PonyBlocks> kneitukas, yeah. i trying to figure it out. only think i having is waist of space on hdd with docker app but cant even run a container other than pull ubuntu..
[02:18:35] <tabakhase> if you dont have anythign to actually do, "make some shit up" :D - trying to learn into the blind is pretty impossible...
[02:19:26] <PonyBlocks> i wanted to make a chrome in docker cointainer with gui
[02:19:34] <tabakhase> and as said, you likely can spend a year with docker before ever touching a baseimage - debian/ubuntu/cent whatever... you want mysql/apache/node/ruby or such.
[02:23:10] <akik> PonyBlocks: https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/docker-containers-on-the-desktop/
[02:23:23] <PonyBlocks> likly can spend years before even able to build a container...
[02:25:33] <tabakhase> na ;-) - building your first comes pretty quickly to - but that shall entail putting your app into a container, say putting your src/ into a php image and running composer -- but like, you really dont want to build a php image when there is a "offical" image on the hub for it... - unless you have to
[02:26:29] <tabakhase> hence, let the hub become your apt/yum/rpm and things will start to make sense rather quickly
[02:26:48] <PonyBlocks> quickly... first time i tried to use docker was in february.. 4 months ago and 0 containers running...
[02:28:07] <kneitukas> well containers cannot "run" per se
[02:28:13] <tabakhase> so *shrugs* pretty sure ive fibbled with docker at least 2 times and quit before actually digging into it cause ive been "forced" by gitlab-ci :D
[02:32:03] <tabakhase> but if you got just a few linux basics, its rly not thaaat much new... 99% get done with like 3 different sub-commands and 10 parameters or so - ontop a little thorie about lifecycle and once all is understood docker-compose to oragize this all a bit more reasonable
[02:33:03] <PonyBlocks> thing is im trying to build diffrent stuff on 3 diffrent os, win,osx,linux. linux is far the most easiest part tho
[02:33:43] <tabakhase> well for docker its all linux :P -- unless were talking windows-server-containers-that-are-actualy-hyperV-via-docker-ui *shivers*
[02:33:53] <tabakhase> win as well as mac come with a VM that runs linux ;)

[02:34:55] <kneitukas> questions regarding storage drivers. I am running DIND inside a K8's pod. The only driver I can use is VFS, because when I am trying to start a daemon with overlay2 or overlay it says that driver not supported. I am running 5.4.0-1046-azure Kernel version.
[02:37:12] <kneitukas> I also overlay2.override_kernel_check=true to daemon.json with no luck
[02:37:25] <tabakhase> PonyBlocks and just to shove that in on the GUI thing - docker is generally console applications (or web or whatever obvs.) -- if you want to run smth with GUI in there, you need a XServer and make sure your allowance is setup correctly and so on, but totally doable then, just needs to set the DISPLAY env-var correctly
[02:39:53] <PonyBlocks> yeah i got xserver etc. i got everything i need for it. only thing is ducker is stupid and i cant even find a decent toturial for learning how to build an docker image or how to even use the stupid dockerfile etc. like the link i got linked. it dont say where to putt that https://github.com/jessfraz/dockerfiles/blob/master/chrome/stable/Dockerfile
[02:40:15] <PonyBlocks> on the computer etc. its just plain stupid. only info is for ppl who knows how to use docker

[02:41:45] <PonyBlocks> so its guides for ppl who allready know their way around docker. its not an introduction to ppl who dont know docker.
[02:41:50] <tabakhase> https://hub.docker.com/r/jess/chrome/ is the interesting link here - YOU dont have to build this
[02:42:08] <tabakhase> that readme is pretty shitt (nonexistent) tho :D - but the image is there
[02:42:37] <tabakhase> "docker run --env DISPLAY=??? jess/chrome" and give it :P
[02:43:21] <PonyBlocks> for me to just grab random images, its same as just install random apps from pornhub 
[02:44:15] <tabakhase> kinda, and kinda not...
[02:44:37] <akik> PonyBlocks: create a dir structure for you docker stuff
[02:44:37] <PonyBlocks> rather just build the sorces on linux distro than grab some random stuff i dont understand whats inside it 
[02:44:38] <kneitukas> containers can't realy do anything to your host, unless you make them privileged
[02:44:46] <tabakhase> its more like browsing to random websites i guess :D - just boxed in docker not a browser
[02:45:09] <akik> PonyBlocks: it doesn't matter where the files are, maybe that's why you didn't find documentation about it
[02:45:13] <tabakhase> *disclaimer* "docker is NOT a security product"

[02:47:37] <akik> tabakhase: what does that mean?
[02:47:40] <PonyBlocks> akik, can be. but its like this simple things that is left out. i understand that the "dockerfile, github, script" for building the container need to be in same folder. but the location of that folder, is it same location as the "ubuntu:container" is located .docker/containers etc 
[02:48:19] <tabakhase> if you literally "just want to build THIS very dockerfile yourself" - you just throw it somewhere - make a "mychromedocker" folder, toss it in there, open your shell there and build it, not so much thingking, more doing :P
[02:48:49] <tabakhase> akik this means if you want to test out your freshest ransomware, use a VM not docker ;-)
[02:48:51] <akik> it's more like you deciding where to put your project files, so you remember where they are
[02:49:23] <PonyBlocks> please tabakhase your probably smart and know how to docker. but you cant explain or help at all. your just talking so much and making things more confusing and throwing out terms and names about docker instead of being able to "teach" 
[02:50:00] <PonyBlocks> when i understand the basic of docker
[02:50:25] <PonyBlocks> maybe then whatever your saying tabakhase make some sence, but for now. your not helping at all. no hard feelings
[02:50:26] <Shaun> it sounds like you’re supposing more complications than exist.  like the dockerfile just needs to be in the current directory.  ‘where’ really isn’t important
[02:51:03] <PonyBlocks> Shaun, perfect.. simple answer
[02:51:07] <Shaun> dockerfile is like a makefile.  it doesn’t matter where it is, only where it is relative to your project
[02:51:09] <PonyBlocks> same for akik 
[02:51:24] * PonyBlocks cheers for Shaun
[02:51:55] <tabakhase> > [23:39:36] <tabakhase> the dockerfile doesnt matter to the image once its build, but you usually pack them into the git repo of your project or whatever
[02:52:01] <tabakhase> this is the very same message :P
[02:52:29] <PonyBlocks> too many words...
[02:52:37] <PonyBlocks> i read bla bla bla bla
[02:52:52] <PonyBlocks> its not a straight up answer at all
[02:53:44] <kneitukas> he was trying to help tho
[02:54:03] <PonyBlocks> yes but it was not a direct answer tho, 
[02:54:17] <tabakhase> if thats C:\dev\bla or /usr/stuff/moep or \\moe\bla\ - like what you expected as answer?
[02:54:58] <PonyBlocks> short but direct and simple answer.
[02:55:01] <PonyBlocks> anyway thanks. 
[02:55:20] <PonyBlocks> to late to even bother with docker tonight.

[04:57:52] <AltReality> on Windows, where does Docker keep it's images?
[04:58:28] <AltReality> I tried googling that, and it says c:\users\public\documents\hyper-v\virtual disk images....but there's nothing in there and I have like 3 containers installed
[05:01:52] <dkeohane> AltReality: are you using docker desktop?
[05:01:57] <AltReality> yes
[05:02:16] <dkeohane> is it under the c:\programdata\dockerdesktop tree?
[05:03:03] <AltReality> There's a single dockerdesktop.vhdx in there...would that contain the various images?
[05:03:10] <BtbN> That depends on the backend
[05:03:21] <BtbN> Generally, they're inside of the Linux VM it brings

[07:54:40] <akurilin_> Quick question, what's the lowest friction way of giving someone access to a custom Docker image, ideally one that's not shared with the public because of its lack of value to anybody except for those one or two people who you're sending it to? Is that Docker Hub? I'm considering the docker save + load route, but that's got a few more manual steps that may not be necessary with a more streamlined approach.
[08:16:20] <sed> in kubernetes when we say replicas does that mean we have 1 main pod + X number of replicas you specify? For example, 2 replicase = 3 pods total?

[17:25:56] <aminvakil> latest docker-compose is 1.29.2 or something like that
[17:27:02] <bonhoeffer> aminvakil, so what do you recommend? I need version 3.9 in my docker-compose
[17:27:21] <bonhoeffer> would like to be running the latest -- but as your link shows: 1.21.0-3 is the stable
[17:27:41] <aminvakil> i install docker-compose manually on all my servers using https://github.com/aminvakil/ansible-role-docker-installation/
[17:27:50] <bonhoeffer> i hate to download manually and get out of the apt ecosystem
[17:28:09] <aminvakil> backports maybe? you are on buster, right?
[17:28:12] <tabakhase> what do you actually have running there... "docker version" client&server as well as docker-compose --version pls
[17:28:55] <aminvakil> Package: docker-compose on amd64 -- stretch: 1.8.0-2; stretch-backports: 1.21.0-3~bpo9+1; buster: 1.21.0-3; bullseye: 1.25.0-1; sid: 1.25.0-1
[17:28:56] <bonhoeffer> yeah -- buster
[17:29:17] <aminvakil> it's not available in buster-backports and bullseye is on 1.25.0, i'm not sure if 3.9 is supported on 1.25.0
[17:29:18] <bonhoeffer> Docker version 20.10.7, build f0df350
[17:29:38] <tabakhase> docker-compose ya kinda "shouldnt" apt... its a static binary download anyhow, so uninstall and just pull the latest in your /usr/bin rly
[17:29:39] <bonhoeffer> docker-compose version 1.22.0, build f46880fe
[17:29:50] <bonhoeffer> maybe i just downgrade the version
[17:29:59] <aminvakil> tabakhase: exactly
[17:30:29] <bonhoeffer> what is the highest version that 1.22.0 will support?
[17:30:32] <aminvakil> basically this is what you need https://github.com/aminvakil/ansible-role-docker-installation/blob/master/tasks/docker-compose.yml

[17:56:06] <aminvakil> nickjj: correct me please, but from https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-versioning/#version-3 it has stated clearly that:
[17:56:07] <aminvakil> "When specifying the Compose file version to use, make sure to specify both the major and minor numbers. If no minor version is given, 0 is used by default and not the latest minor version. "
[17:56:53] <aminvakil> Feuermagier: if you are in docker group, yes, but being in docker group effectively means root
[17:57:04] <nickjj> the version property has been deprecated since 1.27.0
[17:57:20] <nickjj> it's part of the compose spec at https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/master/spec.md#compose-file
[17:58:52] <aminvakil> ah, interesting, so what version will be selected if you don't specify anything?
[17:58:56] <Feuermagier> aminvakil, hmm, I only have normal user privileges on the target machine. Any alternatives you can suggest?
[17:59:05] <nickjj> that's likely why the format chart stops at 3.8 because "compose spec" is being used from this point forward

[20:14:29] <Learry> Hello everyone, I'm pretty new to docker and have a question. I want to build a webcrawler that uses node with a backend (probably something easy like sqlite). Because I want to learn a bit more about docker itself I'd like to do it with docker. So my question really is, when I create the application on my local machine how does docker know which files it should be using? Or how does it know where the code is? I'm unsure if I explain my
[20:14:29] <Learry> question well enough. The other thing I'd like to ask is if I use an image like say https://hub.docker.com/r/nouchka/sqlite3, how would I connect to it? Would I just point a port from the image to a local port and then connect through it on my local machine and tell it to look on that specific port?
[20:18:29] *** Joins: tex (~super@user/dix)
[20:23:29] <tabakhase> Learry see a docker build command - the "." in the end is "this current directory" - (but it could be anything)
[20:24:29] <tabakhase> Learry for connecting - docker comes with "named/user defined networks" - if containers share that, they can resolve each other by "name" (dns) - "publishing ports" is just for You/others/things "on the host" - but docker to docker, networks are king
[20:27:54] <tabakhase> depending on language (node ya said?) you may also want to consider bind-mounting the source from your disk into the runtime so you dont have to spend time rebuilding in dev :P ((obvs only works for stuff that doesnt need a compile)) (think, "use docker as runtime" vs. "dockerize your app into a myapp:1.3.4 image") - and mix that as needed :P
[20:31:30] <Learry> tabakhase: So should I first try to build the application on my local system and then try to dockerize it? How would I go about bind-mounting? I'd love it if I could have a npm start in my docker image and have it be reload automatically. I want to create a script so I can actually run node. Since I don't want to have an actually gui.

[20:36:42] <Learry> I just realised I can just google bind-mounting. So I'll read the documentation for that
[20:42:51] <tabakhase> Learry well YOU build it "from yoru disk" - but you can run it entirely in docker, same for npm, so no nodejs on your "host"
[20:43:07] <tabakhase> (key is so your IDE can read all that :P)
[20:43:35] <tabakhase> what OS ar you on? (with the host) - there are a few... lets call it potholes :D
[20:44:31] <Learry> I'm using macos Big Sur, tbh I'm very new to macos. I've been using linux for the past few years. So terminal is my friend
[20:44:38] <tabakhase> (mac=performance, windows=special file modes, linux=all good) - but say a "linux node_modules folder will explode on windows" :D
[20:45:22] <tabakhase> guess the performance implications you can ignore "for now" ((and later on its just a flag to add to the bindmount or so, not 1000%, never used mac :D))
[20:45:29] <Learry> I think I've got to look out for arm stuff or rather if they're compatible with it
[20:47:05] <Learry> you know what I'll just have a gander and I guess if I'm getting stuck somewhere I'll ask again
[20:47:50] <Learry> tabakhase: thank you for the help. I'll look into what you've been telling me
[20:48:16] <tabakhase> (re "for later" would be http://docs.docker.oeynet.com/docker-for-mac/osxfs-caching/ )
[20:48:46] <tabakhase> tldr is "you make it directional and things work better"
[20:52:29] <tabakhase> Learry last, if you have not touched it yet, check out docker-compose - its all the same as docker (for 99%) but makes operating much more reasonable :D - a yaml file rather then 4 different 700character lang bash commands that need to be run in the right order :D
[20:53:58] <tabakhase> and then yea, pretty much start banging around some - if anything budges wrong youre welcome to throw nopastes/errormessages in here - good luck :P
