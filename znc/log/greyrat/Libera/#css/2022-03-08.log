[03:48:29] <FunkyBob> but the box centering is straight from the docs I linked

[03:49:23] <rickame-> there any way we could clean it up?
[03:49:57] <rickame-> like with flex
[03:50:43] <rickame-> with display flex, align itms center, and justify content center on checkbox and flex 1 and some padding  on ::before would that do it?
[03:54:48] <FunkyBob> sure, but there's nothing to flex
[03:54:56] <FunkyBob> there's no parent/child combo to apply it to
[03:55:24] <FunkyBob> (would be happy to be shown to be wrong...)
[03:56:09] <FunkyBob> switching line height to 3em also fits...  [mistakenly thought y ou'd been using rem throughout]
[03:57:21] <rickame-> oh the ::before isnt a child of the input?
[04:01:32] <Sqaure> can you negate silbing selectors like "are not followed by"
[04:08:54] <hunboy> nope... no parent selector, and no previous sibling selector. the :has() will make some similar but not egzact
[04:10:17] <FunkyBob> hunboy: perhaps you can comment on ::before/after being children-of
[04:11:23] <FunkyBob> oh actually -- When their computed content value is not none, these pseudo-elements generate boxes as if they were immediate children of their originating element, with content as specified by content.

[05:38:20] <FunkyBob> so #wrapper matches the element with id="wrapper"

[06:22:28] <jargon> :( ok
[06:22:43] <FunkyBob> but I get the feeling a lot of your page has become overly complicated...
[06:22:57] <FunkyBob> it doesn't, as I said, help... that we can't see the real contents in jsfiddle
[06:23:50] <jargon> You could just clone it to localhost.
[06:24:46] <jargon> Remember back in the day when mailing list services would download copies of webpages for a small fee? ;)
[06:25:22] <jargon> Instead of pay-per-minute it was pay-per-imprint.

[06:26:49] <jargon> That was the internet before AOL.
[06:27:01] <FunkyBob> see, I would have gone with using the floppy as a background... then you can push that all into the CSS
[06:27:09] <FunkyBob> and have the actual image be ...well, the actual iomage
[06:27:21] <FunkyBob> since the img is the real content, and the floppy is a presentational affectation

[06:30:28] <jargon> Remember I am doing in CSS what would be stupid to do in GD.
[06:30:38] <FunkyBob> GD?
[06:30:48] <jargon> It is a graphics library for Apache.
[06:31:51] <jargon> Imagemagick is another one.
[06:32:48] <jargon> I don't get why you are suprised that I am fixated on using CSS.
[06:33:20] <jargon> Everything in the future uses HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
[06:33:35] <jargon> And XML.
[06:34:13] <jargon> Also, it has become a world of PNG, SVG and MP4.
[06:34:40] <jargon> The stuff you guys consider complex is small fry.
[06:36:01] <FunkyBob> oh wow, that old thing
[06:37:58] <jargon> So asking for assistance on a simple two page project isn't all that much.

[06:40:39] <jargon> The current trend is deepswap. Where prerecorded vidoes and live streams use augmented reality to mess with the footage.
[06:41:50] <jargon> For example, President Donald J Trump losing at a rap battle to Joe Biden.

[07:09:46] <jargon> This is a pair of screenshots for half-screen versus wide-screen.
