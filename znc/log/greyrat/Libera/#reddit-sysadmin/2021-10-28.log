[09:34:03] <xe0n> :|
[09:34:12] <xe0n> that way its just the odt files which are a handful of mbs
[09:34:13] <Work-BWMerlin> each of those files (and the office install) is 3gb+
[09:34:21] *** Joins: Joe-Developer (~Joe-Devel@user/joe-developer)
[09:34:22] <xe0n> you can have the machine download the office files directly
[09:34:25] <Work-BWMerlin> Doing it on a second computer, each capture takes 20+ minutes
[09:34:27] <xe0n> instead of having to transfer 3gb over mdm..

[09:34:52] <xe0n> LOL
[09:35:13] <nobyk> wish server manager had some feature to run a command against a bunch of servers like you can in PDQ
[09:35:17] *** Parts: matty_r (~admin@95.211.172.97.adsl.inet-telecom.org) ()
[09:35:17] <xe0n> you can simply upload the odt setup.exe with the config xml
[09:35:20] <xe0n> and it'll zap that to pcs and run
[09:35:25] <xe0n> and download the office files directly from the cdn
[09:35:31] <JollyRgrs> ^^
[09:35:35] <xe0n> because in a months time you're re-uploading it to airwatch when its out of date
[09:35:36] <Work-BWMerlin> I did read that
[09:35:38] <nobyk> Not that I use it
[09:35:40] <xe0n> especially if you're using the current channel
[09:35:47] <jay-ros> invoke-webrequest "https://thepiratebay.org/WAREZ-CRACKED-OFFICE-2016.bt"
[09:35:47] <JollyRgrs> if you're imaging a lot of devices, that's why you'd just have a local DP with the files on it
[09:35:50] <xe0n> hope you're using the Semi-annual channel
[09:35:52] <JollyRgrs> but otherwise, let them DL from MSFT CDN
[09:36:00] <jay-ros> ...what's a torrent filetype again? I've not seen them for ages
[09:36:05] <JollyRgrs> .torrent
[09:36:07] <JollyRgrs> ...
[09:36:08] <jay-ros> oh

[09:36:24] * jay-ros taps mic *cough*
[09:36:54] <Work-BWMerlin> That guide, literally the first step (after getting the deployment tool) is to download the office files
[09:37:05] <xe0n> YES! and you can script that...
[09:37:07] <xe0n> to run from the client
[09:37:08] <xe0n> ...
[09:37:19] <xe0n> otherwise your airwatch repo is out of date monthly
[09:37:22] <Work-BWMerlin> Is that mentioned in the guide?  Because I read it and did read that
[09:37:24] <xe0n> when new builds are released?
[09:38:48] <Work-BWMerlin> The first two parts are about either downloading from CDN or from local source
[09:38:52] <xe0n> .....
[09:38:54] <xe0n> yes!
[09:39:02] <xe0n> and you can tell the client machines to download from the cdn and then install

[09:51:56] <xe0n> and i posted you like three articles
[09:52:01] <xe0n> that explain it all..

[09:52:31] <xe0n> it'd be easier for you to just zap the stub installer into mdm and tell it to use that
[09:52:32] *** Joins: ss4 (~wootehfoo@user/wootehfoot)
[09:52:45] <Work-BWMerlin> Step five literally says to download it
[09:54:08] <xe0n> read past the first line
[09:54:09] <xe0n> ...
[09:54:12] <xe0n> read the code snippet
[09:54:17] <xe0n> YOU CAN MAKE THE FUCKING CLIENT DO THAT
[09:54:24] <xe0n> then read step 9
[09:54:29] <xe0n> YOU CAN ALSO SCRIPT THAT FOR THE CLIENT TOO
[09:54:30] <xe0n> WOW
[09:55:27] <xe0n> literally zap setup.exe, configure.xml, install.cmd
[09:55:29] <xe0n> to the machine
[09:55:39] <xe0n> in install.cmd - that code snippet, then add the command step 9 is telling you to do
[09:55:42] <JollyRgrs> Work-BWMerlin: have you tried to: Work it, make it
[09:55:44] <JollyRgrs> Do it, makes us
[09:55:46] <JollyRgrs> Harder, better
[09:55:48] <JollyRgrs> Faster, stronger
[09:56:09] <xe0n> or again...use the stub download from portal.office.com

[10:03:18] <JollyRgrs> oh snap!
[10:03:26] <JollyRgrs> it is 4k'ed
[10:03:53] <JollyRgrs> "this movie has been remastered from the original 35MM film to 4K."
[10:03:55] <xe0n> Work-BWMerlin: the other issue you'll run into with the odt xml is that you need to specify the path for the download files, its hardcoded
[10:03:56] *** Quits: sideup66 (~user@user/sideup66) (Quit: WeeChat 3.2)
[10:04:22] <xe0n> so unless you're zapping the files to the same place each time, the xml will fail
[10:04:27] <xe0n> yeah sorry JollyRgrs, i should've read the next few lines
[10:05:43] <xe0n> hence in mdm, the stub file may be better which is a one click run > download > install, just all default settings though
[10:07:10] <JollyRgrs> xe0n: wait what? i thought you only had to specify file location in xml if you're doing "already downloaded source" either network drive or local
[10:07:37] <xe0n> he's downloading it on his machine, uploading it to airwatch, then zapping it back down to pcs
[10:07:46] <JollyRgrs> but... why?
[10:07:48] <JollyRgrs> :P
[10:08:02] <xe0n> otherwise in the xml, he'll need to specify a hardcoded location, make sure the mdm copies the files to the same place all the time (C:\Temp\OfficeInstall ?)
[10:08:10] <xe0n> i dunno, because the documentation he read said so
[10:08:40] <JollyRgrs> yup
[10:09:28] <Cl0udNinja> did anyone here get PC Gamer around the late 90s to early 2000s? there was a game demo in one of them and I cannot remember what it was. it was overhead birds-eye-ish view, and like a strategy game where you had to navigate your team through the mission, was kinda turnbased, sorta I think?

[10:12:23] <Cl0udNinja> its not really mine either, but I remember I did enjoy it.. I just wish I could remember wtf it was called so I could try and find a similar game lol
[10:12:42] <JollyRgrs> what was the theme?

[16:56:03] <xe0n> ehh should be fine?
[16:56:29] <sd> 10<U‚ÄãID_Zero> Morning, y'all
[16:56:47] <SirSceptalot> g'day
[16:56:55] <PublicWiFi> yeah I'd say it's prolly fine
[16:57:15] <PublicWiFi> if you have a ubuntu 20.04 server as a repo it can do some cool sec stuff now with veeam
[16:57:39] <PublicWiFi> just gonna put one in front of my NAS and mount the NAS disks with iscsi or some shit
[16:58:04] <SirSceptalot> unless if it's a satellite, then you really do want ECC. I'mma go out on a limb and guess it's not a satellite though
[16:58:11] <PublicWiFi> its not lol
[16:58:29] <PublicWiFi> the NAS has ECC but if the server sending it the data doesn't have it then its prolly moot
[16:58:55] <SirSceptalot> I need ECC users
[16:59:33] <xe0n> what benefit are you going to get re-doing your repo?
[16:59:41] <xe0n> or changing the config i should say
[16:59:52] <xe0n> is it just because you want to and it sounds cool, or are you actually going to get some real world benefit
[17:00:00] <xe0n> messing with backups just because is errr risky?
[17:00:37] <PublicWiFi> yeah I am
[17:00:49] <PublicWiFi> doing this I can make the repo immutable
[17:00:57] <xe0n> fair enough
[17:01:07] <xe0n> and hows that going to benefit the situation now?
[17:01:08] <PublicWiFi> for however many days. Unless the attacker has root priv on the physical machine the backups cannot be modified
[17:01:14] <xe0n> im guessing you're using an smb share on the nas?
[17:01:22] <xe0n> so wouldn't you need to move the data from the share to a lun?
[17:01:34] <xe0n> yeahhhh i would've already thought you'd have security in place...
[17:01:35] <xe0n> lol
[17:01:35] <PublicWiFi> I'd have to I think
[17:01:45] <PublicWiFi> I have sec in place BUT immutable is dope
[17:01:55] <xe0n> right so you're changing things for the sake of changing things
[17:01:57] <xe0n> gotcha
[17:01:57] <xe0n> lol
[17:02:13] <PublicWiFi> no I'm changing things to benefit from a dope feature that was available when I first bought veeam lol
[17:02:18] <PublicWiFi> was not*
[17:03:26] <SirSceptalot> This is interesting. You don't think adding immutability to backups is a worthwhile change xe0n?
[17:03:28] <PublicWiFi> and they changed the way the linux agent works too and now my NAS is slow to backup
[17:03:47] <PublicWiFi> the synology nas is actually mounted to veeam as a linux server, not SMB
[17:04:02] <PublicWiFi> but its slow now after veeam 11 came out :(
[17:04:06] <xe0n> righto
[17:04:18] <xe0n> and you've confirmed iscsi transfers are faster"
[17:04:19] <xe0n> ?*
[17:04:24] <PublicWiFi> anyways I feel like hunterkll so im done floooding LOL
[17:04:30] <xe0n> LOL
[17:04:40] <PublicWiFi> i haven't had a chance to try it but a few peeps on their support forums have had luck
[17:04:45] <PublicWiFi> they shared a very similar setup to me 
[17:04:58] <xe0n> before changing backups i'd do some testing with iscsi first
