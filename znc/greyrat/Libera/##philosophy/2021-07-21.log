[13:21:35] <DPA> I had mine 2 weeks ago. It's good to know I & most people I know are going to survive.
[13:22:25] <pussipupu> I've only had the first half yet, didn't get magnetism or so far as I can tell any superpowers
[13:22:40] <pussipupu> hopefully it'll kick in at the second dose though
[13:34:03] <DPA> The only thing that prevents us from being able to change ourselfes in whichever way we want is the lack of genetic emulation.
[13:34:04] <DPA> Can't design a gen therapy for a prehensile tail and cat ears without lots of rapid test / trial & error, but can't (or shouldn't) do that with real humans, and no reliable simulation software for this exists either...
[13:35:55] <spruit11> yah.  it's about time.  been self-isolating for over a year.  would be nice to go into the world again
[13:36:20] <spruit11> hope that delta thing isn't too bad
[13:37:01] <pussipupu> I do wonder how many unscrupulous agents might be offering free IV to desperate people and hiding gene edits in it
[13:37:38] <spruit11> heh?
[13:37:47] <pussipupu> Could make a utilitarian argument for it with the right time horizon/discount regime
[13:38:35] <pussipupu> s,IV,IVF,
[13:39:23] <spruit11> do you think you can edit out corona genes?
[13:39:50] <spruit11> if you get rid of the surface protein it binds to.  yah,  maybe
[13:39:54] <spruit11> maybe for the rich
[13:40:04] <DPA> I want a program that can simulate at least 7 x 10^27 atoms and their interactions over 100 years in a few seconds...
[13:40:19] <spruit11> not sure if they can trace this back to gene expression.  but probably
[13:40:20] <pussipupu> No, I'm not respond about covid now
[13:40:40] <pussipupu> Just the possibility that transgenic eugenics is underway
[13:41:50] <spruit11> I am probably more unethical than others because I don't have many objections against it as long as you don't force anything on people
[13:42:06] <spruit11> but I don't know the discussion
[13:43:02] <pussipupu> My worry is precisely it happening without informed consent or ethical oversight
[13:43:31] <pussipupu> I'm not against genetic engineering of humans in principle, just aware of the risks
[13:43:39] <pussipupu> or some of them

[13:47:24] <spruit11> would have saved me stress.  so I have a particularr view on it
[13:48:09] <DPA> Imagine infectious cat ears. That'd be awesome!
[13:49:48] <pussipupu> Um, coding for gross somatic change in developed organisms?
[13:49:51] <pussipupu> seems a tad optimistic
[13:54:28] <DPA> If only rapid virtualized biological prototyping software existed, then I'm sure it wouldn't be too difficult to create such things.
[13:56:13] <DPA> The problem is that humans are still needed to figure out what something really does in a human. That's whats preventing real progress here.
[14:00:13] <spruit11> yah.  also.  never sure whether a human body is an exquisite machine or a complete biochemical mess
[14:00:22] <spruit11> I suspect the second
[14:00:38] <spruit11> no idea why nature would be that precise

[14:14:57] <DPA> Perfection is the opposit of solid design. One error and everything breaks down. In this sense, plants are much more resilient than humans. They have lots of redundant code for the same things.
[14:14:57] <DPA> Add or remove some chromosomes, delete half the code, they don't mind. Take code from another plant, it executes just fine. Merge some plants, it probably still grow & function just fine. Or in other words, I belive the human body is surprisingly precise.

[18:37:40] <ro-bot-o> [url] David Foster Wallace: Suicide and the Death of Agency - Mad In America | www.madinamerica.com
[18:39:06] <audrey> An indictment of the so-called mental health system.
[18:40:08] <audrey> I need to go back to Thomas Szasz´s «Myth of Mental Illness» at some point
[18:41:28] <Atque> audrey: Is mental illness a myth. I've heard voices and had mood lability as recently as at work today.
[18:41:54] <Atque> audrey: I'm not sure how you describe the situation I am in beyond mental health terms.
[18:42:54] <audrey> Well, the article I linked was the starting point of my thought process this morning.
[18:43:39] <Atque> audrey: Where'd your thoughts end up?
[18:44:00] <Keter> https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1376114/
[18:44:01] <ro-bot-o> [url] A proposal to classify happiness as a psychiatric disorder. | www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
[18:44:48] <audrey> The article´s thesis is that «mental illness» is a very convenient catch-all label that the media, the medical profession, and the general public use to oversimplify and dismiss very real problems and very real people.
[18:45:56] <audrey> This has been my experience as well.
[18:46:33] <audrey> Unhappy with the world? Well, you have «mental illness»; any opinions you might have, about the world or about something as intimate as your own experiences, are relegated to the bin, because you´re mentally ill!
[18:46:39] <audrey> It´s dismissive and toxic.
[18:46:58] <Atque> audrey: I kind of shy from describing my real probs tbh... like it is easier to say depression and anxiety than my father was super unideal and I find it extremely hard to retain acquaintances.
[18:48:29] *** Joins: atmoz (~atmoz@user/atmoz)
[18:48:48] <Atque> audrey: Well, people take my opinions seriously as. They make people sweat irl, but... I'm mentally ill I think. I feel upset constantly "depressed", my heart pounds and I can't sleep "anxious" and I see and hear things that aren't there (abusive names).
[18:49:02] <audrey> «It’s especially important in a culture with a propensity to accept easy answers (“mental illness”) or no answers (“we can never know why people kill themselves”) above real answers that don’t sound good enough (“I can’t write”).»
[18:49:07] <audrey> -quote from the article
[18:49:17] <pussipupu> Which “mental health system”?
[18:49:50] <pussipupu> Because you aren't describing the vast majority of what I've experienced in my contacts with mental health carers
[18:50:52] <audrey> Sorry for going down this rabbit hole. I was reading a short bio of David Foster Wallace and it fascinates me how much his psychiatrists failed him.
[18:51:00] <Atque> pussipupu: Have you heard of DiMaggio and Powell's (1983) theory of institutional isomorphism. Maybe, they are call copycats, so which doesn't matter.
[18:51:20] <audrey> And relating it to my own experiences, and those of friends I know who´ve had similar problems, I can´t help but see a pattern.
[18:51:58] <pussipupu> Are they all interracting in a specific system though
[18:52:19] <pussipupu> Atque: I've not, but on the face of it that hypothesis doesn't seem very realistic
[18:52:25] <Atque> audrey: Psychiatrists scream drugs drugs drugs. Psychology get $252 and talk to you as though a casual acquaintance for an hour.
[18:52:37] <audrey> Atque: Well said!
[18:53:05] <pussipupu> You might be seeing the wrong psychologists
[18:53:27] <pussipupu> But also if you're paying at the point of delivery, you might not /have/ a (mental) health system
[18:53:34] <Atque> audrey: Aww... thanks
[18:53:35] <audrey> My last excuse for a «psychologist» told me that I must have some repressed phallic desires that are causing me to «not be happy»
[18:53:48] <audrey> After that I stopped wasting my money
[18:53:53] <pussipupu> That sounds like Freudian or similar pseudopsychology
[18:53:59] <kaine2> the way I've heard mental illness described as a myth was actually in a gender studies class, as in a society that isn't designed to accommodate an illness is creating that illness
[18:54:29] <Atque> pussipupu: I think I have seen eight different ones.
[18:55:07] <pussipupu> Atque: OK, that's a data point, what system are they from?
[18:55:13] <kaine2> so if a society doesn't allow a person with ADHD to live and thrive, and instead forces them to be "chronically unemployed" or "in
[18:55:25] <kaine2> "unable to focus"
[18:55:26] <pussipupu> Because if you're paying at the point of delivery it's probably not meaningfully a “healthcare system”
[18:55:49] <audrey> The website Mad in America is reallyf ascinating. A big diversity of perspectives, most of which are really fresh and avoid the stale kinds of talking points I am used to.
[18:55:51] <audrey> Can recommend.
[18:56:03] <pussipupu> And if they're chatting like you're an aquaintance they might well not be psychologists worthy of the name
[18:57:06] <pussipupu> Well, sure looks like my questions aren't interesting to the interlocutors, so I'll go cook instead, toodles

[18:59:55] <audrey> I´m not very interested in academic debates over what the proper definition of «mental health system» should be, honestly
[19:02:01] <audrey> It didn´t strike me as being related to the initial issues I was hoping to explore. Societal attitudes, point-of-delivery interactions with healthcare providers, pharmacological use.
[19:03:41] <pussipupu> yep, differences between systems and societies are completely irrelevant to that
[19:03:54] <audrey> What society do you think I am talking about?
[19:04:02] <audrey> You´ve known me well enough by now. :D

[19:33:00] <raincomplex> in my experience, abstraction and dismissal are orthogonal
[19:34:06] <raincomplex> abstraction can be positively useful, and it can be used to simplify in damaging ways
[19:35:44] <raincomplex> in other words, i wouldn't say "is 'mental health' a good/useful idea?" has a yes or no answer
