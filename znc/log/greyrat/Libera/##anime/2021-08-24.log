[15:47:36] <emmeka> saganman idk if it was like this in your neck of the woods, but it used to be that having a dedicated landline number was actually pretty expensive when you lived in the countryside, so lots of people shared phonelines on an entire road or whatever. This was called a party line.

[15:51:13] <amigojapan> saganman: I was going to set up a BBS with multiple phone lines, but my hard drive crashed, and my backup floppy disks failed
[15:51:43] <emmeka> they got rid of all the party lines in the 90s, but our family was a late holdout. we still technically kept the party line number too, even though we had it to ourselves in the end

[16:20:33] <emmeka> saganman well, broadcast level Aussie English isn't that different from RP
[16:21:57] <saganman> There is slang in there though at least in cricket commentary.
[16:22:02] <emmeka> to North American ears, picking out an Australian accent from most British ones is difficult, and takes a bit of exposure

[16:23:07] <saganman> Really? The British are easy to tell apart because of their vowels.
[16:23:26] <emmeka> yeah, but to us they sound the same. it's probably the same for you our way.
[16:23:32] <emmeka> saganman when I was younger I didn't think there was actually a Canadian accent, but then I went all over the US and *every time* people could pick it out instantly
[16:23:53] <emmeka> but I kind of speak like a real Canadian hick, so
[16:24:26] <amigojapan> emmeka: do people actually say "aboot"?
[16:24:58] <emmeka> amigojapan idk why Americans are incapable of correctly imitating it, but kind of.
[16:25:02] <saganman> It is hard for me to distinguish different American accents
[16:25:21] <emmeka> to our ears the way Americans say it sounds like the emphasis is too strong on the ou, like they're saying "out"
[16:25:33] <saganman> emmeka: do you people say pow?
[16:25:39] <emmeka> pow?

[16:26:30] <saganman> emmeka: you hear that a lot in corner gas
[16:27:06] <emmeka> "pow" is onomatopoeia

[18:29:47] <saganman> Well I don‚Äôt like too tragic anime or movies but the plot of re:zero has piqued me amigojapan. I will watch it someday.
[18:30:04] <amigojapan> youloveme: HMmm.i have been disappointed at most Western adaptations
[18:30:35] <amigojapan> saganman: ok. I hope you enjoy it like me
[18:31:09] <SpiritOfSummer> this guy is saying it should be illegal to dub anime
[18:31:17] <SpiritOfSummer> on reddit
[18:31:22] <amigojapan> youloveme: I can't think of even one good Western adaptation of an anime
[18:31:57] <SpiritOfSummer> amigojapan: really?
[18:32:05] <youloveme> amigojapan, japanese adaptations have mostly been bad too, not that I have seen many
[18:32:06] <amigojapan> SpiritOfSummer: fortunately things are getting better in translations in general. Compared to the past
[18:32:14] <SpiritOfSummer> good
[18:32:42] <amigojapan> youloveme: yeah, Japanese adaptations have a few tho very few good ones
[18:32:44] <SpiritOfSummer> the one thing I want translators to stop doing is trying too hard to make the English lines sound cool 
[18:33:05] <SpiritOfSummer> because what happens is, not every translation is going to make sense in english sentence structures, that or it just sounds strange
[18:33:25] <SpiritOfSummer> so sometimes, the translators actually have to be creative and reshape it into a more characterized line for who's saying it
[18:33:40] <SpiritOfSummer> and sometimes they just get carried away with this and do that for every line, and some lines are obviously just trying to sound cool and fancy.
[18:33:57] <amigojapan> SpiritOfSummer: back in the day, they even used to translate names, that always pisses my off
[18:34:17] <amigojapan> SpiritOfSummer: even if it was an English name
[18:34:17] <SpiritOfSummer> and that's what people refer to when they say the lines are still way cooler in sub, because they're half right, but I think it's actually a split, I think the english lines are really cool sometimes too
[18:34:25] <SpiritOfSummer> amigojapan: yeah that's just silly
[18:34:55] <SpiritOfSummer> I was happy in dragon ball super that Beerus' move 'Hakai' was not translated to 'destroy' for the dub. they kept the original attack name.

[18:47:10] <ButterNoodle> was just not enough
[18:47:12] <SpiritOfSummer> the 3 dimensional simulation just kind of nudges the eyes to focus in some kind of way I guess

[19:36:37] <amigojapan> Ashl3y4: it takes two weeks after the second shot for the vaccine to be most effective

[19:38:14] <TsundereNoises> it's going to vary person to person. I don't know for sure, but I'd assume 2 weeks is on the high end just because that's how these things tend to get estimated
[19:38:21] <TsundereNoises> better to err that way than too short
[19:38:44] <TsundereNoises> on the other hand, it's for sure basically worthless the next day or whatever, no matter who you are

[19:55:39] <amigojapan> Ashl3y4: they are only shutting down restaurants and bars after 8pm. And even that is volantary

[19:56:23] <TsundereNoises> the 8PM thing is so stupid
[19:56:26] <amigojapan> To enforce lockdowns
[19:56:46] <TsundereNoises> I hate these measures that accomplish nothing, but people do because they're just annoying enough to satisfy that SOMETHING MUST BE DONE urge
