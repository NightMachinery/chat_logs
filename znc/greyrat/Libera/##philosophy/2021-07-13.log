[19:45:00] <audrey> - Oscar Wilde, De Profundis (1897)
[19:45:56] <chatguy> weird
[19:46:03] <chatguy> usually Wilde is a bit more witty than that
[19:46:06] <arryana> nice to have you back
[19:46:07] <audrey> I think it's a great read, honestly
[19:46:27] <audrey> This is Wilde without any of the normal pretenses - Wilde at his most vulnerable and helpless
[19:46:38] <audrey> locked up in prison after being betrayed by his lover
[19:46:55] <lalia> Been a while but I remember really enjoying Wilde. I'm also real fond of that particular passage.
[19:46:57] <audrey> It's one of the most profound works of the era, in my (biased) opinion.
[19:47:33] <brigand> audrey: sounds good
[19:47:57] <audrey> The others on the list being Tolstoy's Father Sergius and Kreutzer Sonata - also, not by coincidence, written at a time of great spiritual and emotional crisis for the author.

[19:49:35] <audrey> A few other choice quotes from De Profundis, in no particular order:
[19:49:38] <audrey> "I thought I could bear a real tragedy if it came to me with purple pall and a mask of noble sorrow, but that the dreadful thing about modernity was that it put tragedy into the raiment of comedy, so that the great realities seemed commonplace or grotesque or lacking in style. It is quite true about modernity. It has probably always been true about actual life. It is said that all martyrdoms seemed mean to the looker on. The nineteenth century is no
[19:49:39] <audrey> exception to the rule. "
[19:51:48] <audrey> "I am completely penniless, and absolutely homeless. Yet there are worse things in the world than that. I am quite candid when I say that rather than go out from this prison with bitterness in my heart against the world, I would gladly and readily beg my bread from door to door. If I got nothing from the house of the rich I would get something at the house of the poor. Those who have much are often greedy; those who have little always share."
[19:53:04] <audrey> Oscar Wilde is not known for philosophy, but De Profundis as a literary opus is on par with any epistle written by Dostoyevsky or Sartre or Proust.
[19:53:37] <audrey> I recently gained access to the unabridged version, which goes into much greater depth about Wilde's catastrophic relationship with Sir Alfred Douglas.
[19:54:07] <audrey> Which in some ways is much more personal and deeply moving, but also loses some of the focus of the better-known abridged version.
[19:54:54] <audrey> Bosie, as he was known, was one helluva SOB.
[19:55:21] <chatguy> always best not to enter into intimate relationships with narcissists and psychopaths

[20:00:41] <Blankspace> Hey thanks chatguy
[20:00:50] <chatguy> yw
[20:01:13] <audrey> The "folk wisdom" is that one becomes more risk averse as one gets older. I'm not sure where I fit, relative to that assertion.
[20:01:56] <audrey> The challenge of wisdom is that, almost by definition, there is no way to impart it pedagogically: it can only be learned through experience, usually negative experience.
[20:01:57] <chatguy> perhaps as we grow we learn to take more calculated risks
[20:02:04] <lalia> I've gone against this observation to some degree.
[20:02:09] <chatguy> audrey, I agree
[20:02:13] *** Quits: bosspotato (~bosspotat@user/bosspotato) (Quit: Leaving)
[20:02:35] <lalia> Getting older has only made living appear more arbitrarily determined.
[20:02:44] <lalia> As such, I'm honestly more inclined to take risks.
[20:03:02] <chatguy> lalia thankfully it's ur life and u can do what u want with it ;)
[20:03:22] <lalia> I'm not talking like that, I'm saying it's a common turn.
[20:03:29] <lalia> Don't be passive aggressive. :)
[20:03:40] <audrey> Herman Tennessen, the Norwegian-Canadian existentialist, refers to this as a kind of knowledge distinct from "a priori" and "a posteriori" - "in the bones and marrow". The example Tennessen gives is a statement like "I will eventually die." We passively know this to be true, but we don't *feel* it to be true in the same way that, e.g. a spy caught behind enemy lines feels it.
[20:03:54] <audrey> Tennessen argues there is something qualitatively different about the latter kind of knowledge.
[20:04:03] <lalia> Nietzsche held a similar view to the one I'm expressing.
[20:04:19] <lalia> Badiou does too, more recently.
[20:05:06] <chatguy> audrey, yes we must experience things for ourselves. the child needs to touch the hot plate to learn why it is best avoided
[20:05:26] <lalia> Sounds like someone without kids. :D
[20:05:40] <lalia> Parents have a lot to do with children learning to avoid danger.
[20:05:46] <chatguy> perhaps as we grow older and wiser we may become more open to listening to guidance from others
[20:05:57] <lalia> Left alone, many kids will return to harmful activities without hesitating.
[20:06:04] <audrey> I mean, pain is a fairly effective pedagogical tool, but that's not the same thing as praising it per se.
[20:06:21] <audrey> I remember being three years old and slamming my fingers into a drawer. Never did that a second time.
[20:07:16] <lalia> This reaction requires finding the sensation undesirable and then also connecting it with the activity of drawer slamming.
[20:07:21] <chatguy> but in order for us to learn from our experience, i think we need to be able to reflect on it seriously and sincerely, and this is something that many are unable or unwilling to do
[20:07:32] <lalia> The problem is: this is an inobvious state of affairs to arrive at for many kids.
[20:07:48] <audrey> When I was six years old, I learned "in the bones and marrow" about regret: I let go of a prized balloon in a parking lot because I was curious what would happen.
[20:08:04] <chatguy> there you go
[20:08:15] <audrey> The feeling of performing an action, and the misery of not being able to undo it.
[20:08:32] <lalia> I better get going, I can tell my time here has more or less run its course for the morning. :D
[20:08:34] <audrey> Oddly, that's a lesson I *didn't* learn very well as a child, apparently.
[20:08:34] <chatguy> and yes many kids are too stupid to learn from their mistakes. just like many adults. it requires a certain level of maturity and self-awareness.
[20:08:35] <lalia> Take care fam.
[20:08:53] <audrey> Because regret has been the predominant theme in my life.
[20:09:18] <audrey> Imagine a haggard, greying thirty year old letting go of that kiddie balloon and crying ... that's a good way to picture me some days. :D :D
[20:09:28] <chatguy> I think it might be a more predominant theme in the lives of others if they were more self-aware and self-reflective
[20:09:28] <audrey> Cheers, lalia! Be well
[20:09:40] <lalia> A crude perspective to take... that whole "stupid" comment really rubs me wrong TBH.

[23:01:55] <zicada> are some pieces of music more indicative of having been created while stoned, and if so, do they evoke a different response in listeners if they are stoned too ?
[23:02:33] <zicada> i think the answer is yes, and a good example is jack black and the catholics - All my ghosts-
[23:02:55] <zicada> not stoned it sounds relatively normal, stoned it sounds laggy and intriguing
[23:03:01] <zicada> weird
[23:03:43] <spruit11> all reggea
[23:04:01] <zicada> more so than average songs, i guess is the hypothesis, if it were the case that the people who wrote it and made it smoked. To what extent does that affect the end result for a person who smokes too
[23:04:36] <spruit11> a lot of music has clear connections to the drugs people take
[23:05:07] <zicada> is there some inherent stonericity in songs created stoned that cause them to be extra enjoyable to listen to stoned
[23:05:17] <spruit11> reggae,  house/techno,  acid,  or German schlagers
[23:05:57] <zicada> Reggae i think in itself at least shows my idea has merit

[23:06:27] <zicada> the others i think are more culturally dependent, whereas the former is that culture as an identithy ?
[23:06:30] <zicada> identity
[23:07:25] <zicada> to be a rastafari is an identity that involves smoking weed and listening to a particular style of music, and since most of it was made stoned, people who are stoned tend to universally enjoy it
[23:07:31] <zicada> even if theyre otherwise into metal
[23:07:59] <zicada> for example
[23:08:24] <zicada> but its more than just that, its a sense of authenticity
[23:08:28] <spruit11> yes,  music often comes to be associated with a life style
[23:08:39] <zicada> if you dont have that sense of authenticity, then its not worth your time
[23:08:47] <spruit11> nono,  that's completely inauthentic.  it's when I walk away usually
[23:09:09] <spruit11> like Germans kind-of developed the notion of a psytrance uniform.  never liked that
[23:09:36] <zicada> the definition of authenticity when it comes to human beings.. it has to be paradoxical
[23:10:05] <zicada> people arent the only authors of their authentic selves, others have a lot to do with it
[23:10:05] <spruit11> I don't think you can be authentic once you don someone's uniform
[23:10:19] <zicada> it depends what you mean
[23:10:22] <spruit11> you might feel well.  doesn't look authentic to me
[23:10:30] <spruit11> maybe it is
[23:10:37] <zicada> in terms of identity, authentic usually means something that comes from within, and informs the external
[23:11:23] <zicada> the paradox comes in that somebody who wishes to appear authentic, has to compare themselves to others
[23:11:30] <zicada> they are authentic compared to others
[23:11:59] <zicada> its similar to how the idea of Emo is to be anti like everyone else, yet Emos are a group who are identical to eachother

[23:12:48] <zicada> i think you have to face some paradox like that if you wish to form an identity that attempts to be "authentic"
[23:14:05] <zicada> why cant it be a response to a social stimuli, where the alternatives are either having an authentic or a sincere identity
[23:14:48] <spruit11> like Burning Man is way nicer at an attempt at true authenticity.  though maybe that can never be reaced
[23:14:50] <zicada> but sincere identities come from lack of choice. Farmers have a sincere identity of being a farmer, class informs identity
[23:14:51] <spruit11> *reached
[23:15:22] <zicada> with a sincere identity, its the external that informs the internal you, you are what you seem to be, your lot in life
[23:15:37] <zicada> with authentic identity, you create your own identity
[23:15:57] <zicada> and the cultural ideal is to create the most authentic identity for oneself

[23:16:57] <spruit11> god no.  the cultural idea is to follow guidance and buy the wares of rolemodels
[23:16:58] <zicada> an interesting thinker called Hans-Georg Muller has a third identity he calls profilicity
[23:17:14] <zicada> that applies to both companies, influencers, and individuals
[23:17:29] <zicada> profile and brand is your identity
[23:17:34] <spruit11> it doesn't really matter what role model.  people just feel well in mobs
[23:17:35] <zicada> in a greater sense than with authenticity
[23:18:14] <zicada> they feel well among other identities they feel at ease around, i guess
[23:18:36] <zicada> ideas like those hold much more merit now than 20 years ago
[23:18:36] <spruit11> yah,  that's mainly it

[23:21:41] <zicada> yeah but thats fully subjective, its humans
[23:21:44] <zicada> humans are paradoxical
[23:21:59] <zicada> i wish economics would take that to heart in their models more
