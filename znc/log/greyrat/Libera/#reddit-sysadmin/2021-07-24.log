[00:27:24] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> @Furcifer When I get to it.
[00:27:31] <layer8> you're welcome vinrock
[00:27:41] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> Email is by definition not urgent, and thus comes after whatever I'm working on.
[00:27:45] <sintax> i'm hybrid
[00:27:50] <sintax> home some days, office the others. 
[00:28:07] <sd> 09<Q​uasky> Especially when I get 100+ emails a day.
[00:28:43] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> Priority order - 1. Call, 2. IM, 3. Email
[00:28:44] <sintax> ctrl a del
[00:29:30] <sd> 04<F​urcifer> i have some people not replying to my emails all day. driving me up a wall
[00:29:47] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> If it needs a prompt response, call them.
[00:30:30] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> If I need a response, I either call or IM them.  Otherwise it gets dealt with whenever they respond.
[00:30:47] <sd> 06<b​enjamie> If it's any email from a supervisor or boss, I would respond at least within the hour.
[00:31:09] <sd> 06<b​enjamie> For regular users, when you have the chance.
[00:31:42] <sintax> Calls/Teams are first, tickets whenever. I don't have an SLA.
[00:31:48] <sintax> But I try to answer everyone same day
[00:32:00] <vinrock> im try not to be punctual with emails or text messages
[00:32:05] <vinrock> then people will think they can get hold of me quickly
[00:32:05] <sintax> but if i need an answer right away i just call
[00:32:18] <sintax> vinrock: it's a good idea. 
[00:32:26] <sintax> I don't answer texts unless it's from my boss
[00:32:32] <sintax> or another it team member
[00:32:39] <vinrock> i dont even look at texts until i feel like picking up my phone
[00:32:41] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> The boss has the same capability of making a phone call as everyone else.  If they need a response immediately, they can call.
[00:32:51] <vinrock> if someone needs me in a hurry they can call
[00:33:13] <sd> 04<F​urcifer> we have half the team on site and other half teleworking. my emails aren't urgent, but i expect them to be answered within an hour or two. just wanted perspective to see if that's unreasonable
[00:33:33] <sintax> email, yes
[00:33:37] <sintax> im is much faster
[00:33:46] <sd> 04<F​urcifer> we don't have IM
[00:34:10] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> I don't think that's reasonable - if I'm working on a project/issue, I can easily be down a rabbit hole for hours.
[00:34:23] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> So expecting an email response in "an hour or two" isn't always going to happen.
[00:34:34] <sd> 04<F​urcifer> do your bosses know when you're on a project?
[00:34:48] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> I have projects/tickets coming all the time.
[00:35:09] <sd> 06<b​enjamie> It depends on what industry you're working in I suppose. But I work in a school district, there aren't that many huge projects that would have me ignore my emails all day.
[00:35:52] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> I'm in healthcare.  I'm an admin, and I always have projects.

[00:36:58] <sd> 04<F​urcifer> we kind of have an unwritten rule, our teleworkers are mostly on backup
[00:37:07] <sd> 04<F​urcifer> however, most people monitor email
[00:38:19] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> I see email alerts when it comes in, but I generally don't go fully read/respond right away.
[00:38:32] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> I generally do respond relatively quickly, but there are times that doesn't happen.
[00:39:06] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> If there's an expectation to respond within 2 hours, I can't guarantee that.
[00:39:12] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> That's my point.  Usually make it, but not always.

[22:32:57] <nobyk> when installing linux, eg Debian, why would I want my files and stuff in different partitions?
[22:33:19] <nobyk> the 'user friendly' option is to have it all on one partition. but what's the con of that
[22:34:30] <aban> nobyk: if the root partition fills up the server won't be happy, and it can make it difficult to recover. Splitting data across partitions means one partition filling up won't fill / and cause (as many) problems.
[22:34:48] <XV8> nobyk in the world of running servers, if your root partition fills up, your entire system will be hosed until you drop to single user and clear stuff out. Makes data backup and recovery easier as well.
