[00:28:22] <kevr> Hello ladies, gentlemen and non-binary beings. So, I have an ASUS MB169B+, for which I've previously used the `displaylink` driver. This round, I've installed the displaylink driver via AUR with evdi-git (because evdi couldnt dkms against my kernel headers). Just build them both fresh. Here are some pieces of data: http://sprunge.us/TWqxj4. Normally, when it's working and I plug the screen in,
[00:28:24] <kevr> after the usb being recognized in dmesg, it would tell me that displaylinkmana is setting up the screen, but that is not happening now.

[12:36:37] <Ingar> you shouldn't be running makepkg as root
[12:36:38] <GuiToris> I meant that but it's rather cumbersome. (note the plural of packageS) When I'd like to update my system I may have many larger packages. I can't really go away from the computer because it can ask for password any time

[13:55:16] <sheep> if I try building this on a gentoo system, python setup.py build fails at a similar point. I think this is an error in the code
[13:56:14] <lunario> ah ok, now i saw the comments too. so i guess it's a known issue and i should just use the git repo
[13:56:26] <sheep> I'm building directly from the git repo
[13:56:51] <sheep> my guess is that the setup.py needs to be rewritten to be able to look for includes in the build directory instead of in the installed directory

[18:49:58] <physkets> sheep: I vaguely remember that the instructions in the wiki used to include a line to link the signatures as well.
[18:50:09] <bloodfart69> I know. Like I said before: I was about to create one via mmcblk0p1 was going to be the /usr. Was going to add it to my /etc/fstab and hope it clears the error. I quit doing that as I am not using the specified HOOKS I said before. I am sticking with what I said before, as I don't know if anyone has booted with systemd, sd-encrypt, and sd-plymouth. And if you have, how did you do it exactly?
[18:50:19] <lash> bea: from what i read ipv4 can be represented in ipv6 with a bunch of zeros optionally with 0xffff inbetween
[18:50:53] <lash> not sure whether thats true though

[22:54:06] <rawktucc> brb
[22:54:23] <tirnanog> for some reason, your INPUT chain is left completely bereft of rules. so all incoming packets hit the DROP "policy" instantly.
[22:54:31] <mpan> tirnanog: what it would be? It may be worth reporting as a bug, if in fact it’s UFW’s doing.
[22:54:32] <tirnanog> the question then is: why?
[22:55:09] <tirnanog> mpan: if you look at https://paste.debian.net/plainh/4c3ec5f9 and search for "-A INPUT", you'll find no matches. that's the problem, in a nutshell. there are all those fancy user-defined chains and they are never called.
