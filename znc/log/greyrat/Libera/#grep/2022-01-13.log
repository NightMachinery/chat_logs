[21:25:30] <OnlineCop> My default GNU grep alias includes `-n` to show line numbers; on occasion, I want all of the REST of the parameters, but want to negate that option (in other words, DON'T show line numbers). Is there a flag to clear that?
[21:28:44] <OnlineCop> For example, if this is my default: `alias grep_='grep -PHRn --exclude-dir={.git,.vs,.vscode,bin,obj} --include=*.{ext1,ext2,ext3}'`
[21:28:46] <OnlineCop> Then I would like some equivalent that could remove `-n` so it became this: `alias grep_='grep -PHR --exclude-dir={.git,.vs,.vscode,bin,obj} --include=*.{ext1,ext2,ext3}'`
[21:37:00] <OnlineCop> In the case of the `-H` flag, I can simply append `-h` to the end and it overrides the earlier `-H` behavior.

[23:01:18] <e36freak> doesn't look like it
[23:01:52] <e36freak> you could use a shell function instead of an alias and have your own flag that will unset the -n
[23:02:03] <e36freak> or rather tell the function not to use -n
