[20:17:36] <enebo[m]> puritylake: I updated the branch so it passes all printf related specs.  There are two other errors showing up on CI so it is still red.  I don't think they are related but I will look into it tomorrow
[20:17:50] <enebo[m]> I reran your %c PR and there are two failures: https://app.travis-ci.com/github/jruby/jruby/jobs/544833666#L1428
[20:18:47] <enebo[m]> It is possible these are parser issues and not specific to what you moved over but take a look
[20:19:46] <enebo[m]> Fixing issues with the sprintf parser is something you can change if you are willing.
