[01:46:42] <re101-jackal-74> https://regex101.com/r/HUqRvM/1 Hello, I was trying to see if there was a way to catch a specific type of raid message that we got on a discord server; this message would contain atleast two mentions, a long  quote containing the word "mohammed" and ending with a random string of five numbers/letters(so kinda a botted message) . Here's the example
[01:46:43] <re101-jackal-74> of the quote:
[01:46:43] <re101-jackal-74> "<@!111111111111111111> <@!111111111111111111> <@!111111111111111111> Robert Nicholas Christian Topala CAUSED the war in UKRAINE! To find out more, Sabscribe to Mohammed Ja'kalem Al-abdula. This is no joke! If you subscribe you are showing the people of ukraine support! Zelensky thanks you! rQzWe"
[01:46:44] <re101-jackal-74> What I got for now is being able to catch the mentions from 2 to an infinite number and the problems are: Idk how to put a space between these; how to make sure that there is text before and after the word mohammed and then that at the end of the quote there's a ! with a 5 characters/numbers string. Sorry for the hard question atleast for me :/

[01:46:49] <OnlineCop> Javascript doesn't allow this, but PCRE allows a really nice "eliminate edge cases" feature: match everything that you want to exclude (your edge cases). Append `(*SKIP)(*F)|` (notice the trailing '|' ) and then put the rest of the regex you want to keepmatch.
[01:47:14] *** rebot sets mode: -q re101-jackal-74!*@*
[01:47:20] <OnlineCop> re101-jackal-74: IRC kills most of your formatting. Paste the text in regex101 and share that link.
[01:47:39] <re101-jackal-74> oh alright
[01:48:06] <OnlineCop> What part of this are you trying to match? The <@!...> ?
[01:49:15] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/HUqRvM/4
[01:50:28] <re101-jackal-74>  I was able to match the <@!\d{17,19} ; the problem was indeed to have mohammed into the quote and then the 5 number characters string at the end being random
[01:51:01] <OnlineCop> You were also missing a `.*` to allow "anything" between that first portion and the (stuff) you wanted to match.
[01:51:21] *** Quits: re101-bear-17 (~re101-bea@154.177.76.225) (Quit: Client closed)
[01:51:43] <OnlineCop> Does version /4 work like you need?
[01:53:30] <re101-jackal-74> I think I explain wrong a thing; I'd like to match the quote after the mentions only if there's "mohammed" and at the end after that ! a 5 numbers/characters
[01:53:32] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/HUqRvM/5 continues the match to the end of the line (I don't know whether that double quote at the end is in the message, or just what you pasted).
[01:54:28] <OnlineCop> So after the '!' at the end, there's 1+ (or 0+ ?) spaces before the 5 random characters?
[01:55:03] <re101-jackal-74> !(space)(5 random characters/numbers)
[01:55:05] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/HUqRvM/6
[01:55:08] <re101-jackal-74> usually it's just one space
[01:55:22] <OnlineCop> You can change the \s* to \s+ or just \s if you want.
[01:55:56] <re101-jackal-74> oh not actually expert now, what would that change exactly?
[01:56:49] *** Joins: jmdaemon (~jmdaemon@user/jmdaemon)
[01:57:37] <OnlineCop> \s* would allow 0 spaces before the last 5, so it would technically allow "6 random characters" (since 0 spaces before 5 letters... still matches).
[01:57:58] <OnlineCop> \s+ would expect 1 or more spaces; \s (with no * or + quantifier) would be "exactly one space".
[01:58:06] <re101-jackal-74> ooh I see
[01:58:09] <OnlineCop> I think you'd be fine with \s+
[01:58:21] <re101-jackal-74> Pretty sure this would work perfectly, thank you so much!
[01:58:49] <re101-jackal-74> oh wait a last thing, sorry I forgot
[01:59:25] <re101-jackal-74> there were cases were the first part ( the mentions one) was not added into the message; would be enough to put a | and paste all the rest of the regex?

[02:03:31] <OnlineCop> Shouldn't be too difficult, although this regex is missing a '^' to anchor it to the beginning of the line.
[02:03:50] <OnlineCop> If anything comes before that (such as a timestamp, etc.), that may mess up what you're matching so far.

[15:49:46] <purplex> seems like this will do it, but we can optimize it after you tell us your flavor re101-dusky-79
[15:51:06] <purplex> something like https://regex101.com/r/8MuboG/3
[15:55:57] <mysticspiral[m]> i wish more flavors would support \K

[17:53:56] <purplex> for your two words, it could be possible, but don't expect to match unspecified number of words
