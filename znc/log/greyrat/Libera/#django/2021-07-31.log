[00:42:28] <Steve-Dusty> docker's a VM?!
[00:42:34] <GinFuyou> It would be a "cool VM" if it was straight-forward to use

[00:44:34] <Steve-Dusty> wtf code came from linux
[00:44:39] <Steve-Dusty> linux is mother of code
[00:44:49] <Steve-Dusty> they should accommodate you, not the other way around
[00:45:34] <b-rex> we use whatever provides the least friction across every platform
[00:46:15] <b-rex> pipenv, for example, seems to be preferred among people writing python on windows
[00:46:24] <b-rex> but also works just fine in linux
[00:46:29] <ChrisWarrick> that’s a weird preference
[00:46:29] <Steve-Dusty> what do arch chads use?
[00:47:03] <b-rex> ChrisWarrick: i know there are much better virtualenv wrapper type things
[00:47:12] <b-rex> pipenv is what we got stuck with at my shop lol
[00:47:13] <ChrisWarrick> b-rex: nah, all of them are garbage
[00:47:19] <ChrisWarrick> venv is all you need
[00:47:27] <Steve-Dusty> no
[00:47:30] <Steve-Dusty> pipenv is ez
[00:47:35] <Steve-Dusty> venv and virtuan env = hard
[00:47:37] <Steve-Dusty> just use pipenv
[00:47:47] <b-rex> before i worked here, i used venv because i agree there is no point using that newfangled stuff. it's an uneccessary abstraction imo
[00:47:58] <Steve-Dusty> 3 commands to memorize: 1: `pipenv install PACKAGE` 2: `pipenv shell` 3: develop
[00:48:15] <ChrisWarrick> pipenv shell is too stateful
[00:48:18] <Steve-Dusty> venv is `source some sjfesoj`
[00:48:18] <ChrisWarrick> pipenv install is too slow
[00:48:24] <Steve-Dusty> what even is `source`
[00:48:29] <GinFuyou> poetry is better
[00:48:29] <Steve-Dusty> and those commands

[01:59:51] <GinFuyou> in form_valid you already have validated form, so just obj = form.save(commit=False)
[02:00:04] <GinFuyou> and then return redirect in the end
[02:02:33] <Steve-Dusty> Do I do that in forms.py?
[02:03:10] <Steve-Dusty> or a form_valid under my Class view
[02:03:18] <GinFuyou> No, as I said, override form_valid
[02:04:31] <GinFuyou> Well, you could go form path, but you will have to change it to accept whatever data you need as still will have to change the view
[02:05:07] <Steve-Dusty> wait, so I don't need to add resort to creating a forms.py?
[02:05:21] <Steve-Dusty> I can keep the `fields = [ ]` ?
[02:05:41] <Steve-Dusty> the link to the docs you sent put it in forms.py
[02:06:59] <Steve-Dusty> ohh I see it
[02:07:02] <GinFuyou> I was referring snippet in note
[02:07:12] <GinFuyou> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/forms/modelforms/#the-save-method also shows saving form
[02:07:24] <Steve-Dusty> https://dpaste.org/XQAd
[02:07:25] <GinFuyou> which is usually done in views
[02:07:55] <GinFuyou> yes this trick also works for some cases
[02:09:15] <Steve-Dusty> is that not overriding?
[02:09:37] <GinFuyou> ?
[02:09:51] <Steve-Dusty> you said "this trick" was this not what you were talking about previously?
[02:09:52] <GinFuyou> It overrides form_valid just the same
[02:10:02] <GinFuyou> the trick is using form.instance
[02:10:13] <GinFuyou> docs shows another method
[02:10:19] <Steve-Dusty> ok
[02:10:50] <GinFuyou> both work generally, but this one is usually shorter because you can call super
[02:11:08] <GinFuyou> but it may not fit in some more complex cases
[02:13:59] <Steve-Dusty> can you send the example that you were talking about?
[02:14:01] <Steve-Dusty> the more complex way
[02:14:53] <GinFuyou> second snippet in last link
[02:15:01] <GinFuyou> using commit=False
[02:15:20] <GinFuyou> it's not more complex, it's just a bit longer
[02:15:32] <GinFuyou> But more "universal"
[02:15:45] <Steve-Dusty> and where do I put that in class based view?
[02:16:06] <Steve-Dusty> create a new method?
[02:16:48] <GinFuyou> I said 2 times: form_valid
[02:16:56] <GinFuyou> What is the confusion?
[02:17:25] <GinFuyou> you just won't be creating a form, since it's passed to that method already (and validated)
[02:17:47] <Steve-Dusty> ok i get it now
[02:19:34] <GinFuyou> https://dpaste.org/3EBf#L4
[02:20:30] <Steve-Dusty> I have a problem with reverse() in get_absolute_url. https://dpaste.org/g8nN. After creating a student, I want it to go back to the page where the "student" button was placed
[02:20:48] <Steve-Dusty> seems like every time I create a new student it goes to a random /dashboard/<int:pk?
[02:21:25] <Steve-Dusty> it increments* instead of returning back
[02:22:04] <GinFuyou> why wouldn't it increment if it saves a new student?
[02:22:50] <Steve-Dusty> now that I think of it, adding classes increments too...
[02:23:06] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: i need your help
[02:23:14] <wallbroken> i enabled a paginator
[02:23:15] <Steve-Dusty> wait.. let me try something first
[02:23:19] <wallbroken> it works right
[02:23:23] <wallbroken> but i have a problem
[02:23:36] <wallbroken> when i apply a filter, it looeses itsef when i move to the next page
[02:23:47] <wallbroken> so there is not integration between paginator and filter
[02:23:57] <GinFuyou> if you want to go "back" you need something to store what is "back", since http generally doesn't provide it
[02:25:51] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: there's no logical way to stay on the same 'page' when you change the filtering... reset the page number when you cnahge the filter
[02:25:55] <FunkyBob> because the list has changed
[02:26:34] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: let me explain an use case
[02:26:56] <wallbroken> i set a filter and i see the correct results on the first page
[02:27:02] <wallbroken> then when i click on "next"
[02:27:11] <wallbroken> i lost filtering
[02:27:18] *** Quits: thiras (~thiras@user/thiras) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[02:27:23] <wallbroken> and i see the next page as it shown without filtering
[02:27:23] <Steve-Dusty> Okay I can't figure it out.
[02:27:35] <Steve-Dusty> How do I store it?
[02:27:35] <wallbroken> that's because the filtering is URI based
[02:27:43] <Steve-Dusty> when you say "store" you mean in a database?
[02:27:50] <wallbroken> and clicking "next", it losts the filtering part of the URI
[02:28:02] <GinFuyou> Steve-Dusty, well, what is "back" for you here?
[02:28:23] <wallbroken> this is the url on the first page:
[02:28:24] <wallbroken> http://localhost:8000/?order=-heel_height&color=&size=&model=&style=&toe=
[02:28:37] <wallbroken> on the second page is: http://localhost:8000/?page=2
[02:28:38] <GinFuyou> if you are adding student to a class, class view can be back, and you have the id
[02:28:39] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: yep
[02:28:47] <wallbroken> so, all filters criterias are lost
[02:28:50] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: you need to teach your templates to keep the existing querystring
[02:28:50] <Steve-Dusty> example:
[02:28:52] *** Joins: thiras (~thiras@user/thiras)
[02:29:28] <Steve-Dusty> dashboard/5/addstudent --> goes back to dashboard/5
[02:29:32] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: https://dpaste.org/HOhu
[02:29:35] <Steve-Dusty> now dashboard/6
[02:29:37] <Steve-Dusty> not*
[02:29:37] <wallbroken> this is my pagination code
[02:29:39] <wallbroken> on the template
[02:29:57] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: yes... as you can see, you're only carrying forward the page=
[02:30:37] <wallbroken> yes, i should tell him the current filter criteria, if there are
[02:30:49] <FunkyBob> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/request-response/#django.http.QueryDict.urlencode
[02:31:03] <GinFuyou> Steve-Dusty, if dashboard id is in the url, you can get it from there
[02:31:23] <Steve-Dusty> it is
[02:31:40] <Steve-Dusty> do I still use reverse()?
[02:31:42] <FunkyBob> some years ago for another project I wrote some template tags/filters to help with generating "currenty querystring + new page number"
[02:32:22] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: why do you linked me what?
[02:32:40] <wallbroken> Returns a string of the data in query string format.
[02:32:44] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: request.GET is a QueryDict instance
[02:32:50] <GinFuyou> Steve-Dusty, yes, just provide args you actually need
[02:33:15] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: q = QueryDict(request.GET)
[02:33:18] <wallbroken> you say this?
[02:33:19] <FunkyBob> no
[02:33:23] <FunkyBob> IT'S ALREADY ONE
[02:33:35] <wallbroken> so, why did you linked me that?
[02:33:36] <FunkyBob> request.GET _is_ _a_ _QueryDict_ _instance_
[02:33:42] <FunkyBob> so you would know that method exists to help you
[02:33:44] <FunkyBob> of course
[02:34:56] <wallbroken> ?page={{ page_obj.next_page_number }}?{{ request.GET }}
[02:34:59] <wallbroken> something like this?
[02:35:13] <FunkyBob> ...
[02:35:35] <wallbroken> i need to compose as string which contains page number and filtering criterias
[02:35:36] <wallbroken> right?
[02:35:37] <FunkyBob> I mean, it would have to be & not ?
[02:35:49] <FunkyBob> and you would call the method I linked you to
[02:36:02] <wallbroken> querydict?
[02:36:03] <wallbroken> why?
[02:36:05] <FunkyBob> the whole point of linking you to it... was because I knew you'd need to use it
[02:36:06] <FunkyBob> No
[02:36:09] <FunkyBob> THE ONE I LINKED YOU TO
[02:36:13] <FunkyBob> what method did I link you to?
[02:36:17] <FunkyBob> method, not class
[02:36:37] <wallbroken> urlencode() ?
[02:36:45] <FunkyBob> yes
[02:37:00] <wallbroken> why would i need to?
[02:37:21] <FunkyBob> I would have thought 10 seconds lookng at just the examples in the docs would explain that
[02:37:34] <FunkyBob> what is it you think request.GET contains?
[02:37:42] <wallbroken> ?page={{ page_obj.next_page_number }}&{{ request.GET.urlencode() }}
[02:37:47] <wallbroken> do you mean this way?
[02:37:48] <FunkyBob> closer
[02:37:52] <FunkyBob> but you don't () in templates
[02:37:58] <wallbroken> yes, i remember that
[02:38:58] <FunkyBob> time to give it a burl... see how it goes
[02:39:32] <wallbroken> well, it works, but i have a bug
[02:39:36] <wallbroken> when it reach the last page
[02:39:47] <wallbroken> NEXT button is still there
[02:39:57] <wallbroken> and if i click on that it does some strange url
[02:40:09] <FunkyBob> yep
[02:40:21] <FunkyBob> typically you'd use an {% if %} to only include the next button if there is a next page
[02:41:03] <wallbroken> oh no
[02:41:10] <wallbroken> it's clear what happens
[02:41:15] <wallbroken> everytime i click on next
[02:41:22] <wallbroken> it appends the queryset filter parameters
[02:41:32] <FunkyBob> it includes page in the querystring, yes
[02:41:43] <FunkyBob> this is why I made the template util
[02:41:50] <wallbroken> http://localhost:8000/?page=3&page=3&page=3&page=3&page=3&page=3&page=3&page=2
[02:41:53] <FunkyBob> yes
[02:41:58] <FunkyBob> this is why I made the template util
[02:42:07] <FunkyBob> a tag lib to help fiddle with that
[02:42:28] <wallbroken> can you show me that please?
[02:42:48] <FunkyBob> not sure i still have it... it was for a client
[02:43:17] <wallbroken> do you know some other way to fix that?
[02:45:12] <FunkyBob> hang on
[02:47:06] <FunkyBob> something like this, as a template filter https://dpaste.org/T8aq
[02:51:09] <wallbroken> qg ?
[02:51:28] <FunkyBob> typo
[02:51:30] <FunkyBob> qd
[02:53:02] <wallbroken>  href="?page={{ request.GET|page_querystring:page_number }}"

[02:53:40] <wallbroken> no, that's not
[02:53:52] <wallbroken> Invalid filter: 'page_querystring'
[02:54:18] <FunkyBob> did you put it in a template tags lib, and load that in your template?
[02:54:36] <FunkyBob> and no, not ?page=
[02:54:53] <FunkyBob> just the ?
[02:54:57] <wallbroken> ok
[02:55:14] <FunkyBob> am baffled as to (a) where you did put that code
[02:55:21] <FunkyBob> and (b) what reasoning you used to believe it would work
[02:56:20] <FunkyBob> these are not rhetoric... I really would like to understand your thinking here.
[02:56:53] <wallbroken> {% load page_querystring %}
[02:57:11] <wallbroken> this is the right way to load?
[02:57:34] <FunkyBob> that will load a temmplate tag library called page_querystring...
[02:58:18] <wallbroken> https://dpaste.org/bYjd#L47

[03:25:19] <FunkyBob> oh, blah, I've been in JS world for too lonk
[03:25:24] <FunkyBob> it should be qd['page'] =

[03:26:12] <FunkyBob> https://dpaste.org/7QT3#L6
[03:27:33] <wallbroken> ok, it works, thank you
[03:27:54] <wallbroken> to make that it automatically press "next" when i scroll to the end
[03:28:07] <wallbroken> i just need to add a js code and pass the "next" url ?
[03:28:34] <FunkyBob> sounds like a terrible user experience
[03:28:40] <FunkyBob> but sure, you could do that
[03:28:58] <wallbroken> it could be a little boring to click everytime on "next"
[03:29:13] <FunkyBob> it would also be frustrating to have the page change when you didn't mean it
[03:30:04] <wallbroken> ok, and to change the number of items in the page
[03:30:10] <wallbroken> in the sense
[03:30:17] <wallbroken> i have 12 x 20 grid
[03:30:24] <wallbroken> insead 4 x 8 grid
[03:30:31] <wallbroken> it's a css / html problem?
[03:30:35] <wallbroken> not django problem?
[03:30:56] <FunkyBob> if you want to control the number, you'd need to pass that...
[03:31:02] <FunkyBob> if you want to control the arrangement, the rendering...
[03:31:06] <FunkyBob> that can be a CSS issue

[05:02:17] <Steve-Dusty> I have a Django issue
[05:02:44] <Steve-Dusty> I know that get_absolute_url and reverse() will return an increment
[05:03:01] <Steve-Dusty> for example /stebdadeb/3 ---> /stebdadeb/4 once submitted
[05:03:08] <Steve-Dusty> However, I want it to remain at 3
[05:03:31] <Steve-Dusty> instead of reverse, can I use `redirect`?
[05:08:29] <Steve-Dusty> https://dpaste.org/uU7z
[05:08:35] <Steve-Dusty> what's the cause of the error?
[05:09:16] <Steve-Dusty> in the last line of models.py, I set `pk` to `self.object.student_set.id` because I want to get the id of the class the student is in
[05:09:19] <Steve-Dusty> so I used `_set`
[05:12:24] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty: objects not object ?
[05:12:45] <FunkyBob> oh, no
[05:12:55] <FunkyBob> you've put self.object on your model method

[07:10:15] <Steve-Dusty> FunkyBob can you help me debug that last line if you can?
[07:12:19] <FunkyBob> ok
[07:12:53] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty: in a DetailView or EditView ... self.object refers to the model instance
[07:13:04] <FunkyBob> but that makes no sense on a _model_ class, as you tried to use it
[07:13:50] <Steve-Dusty> oh..
[07:13:55] <Steve-Dusty> i can't self.object inside a model
[07:13:56] <Steve-Dusty> ?
[07:14:01] <FunkyBob> is this still your code? https://dpaste.org/uU7z#L34
[07:14:06] <FunkyBob> correct.
[07:14:17] <FunkyBob> it makes no sense on a model.
[07:14:31] <FunkyBob> typically on a CBV self.object is a model instance... so on a model class the instance is self
[07:14:46] <FunkyBob> also, get_absolute_url should be calling reverse() not redirect()
[07:14:52] <Steve-Dusty> hmmm..
[07:14:52] <FunkyBob> it should return a url
[07:14:57] <Steve-Dusty> reverse increments..
[07:14:57] <FunkyBob> [the hint is in the name :) ]
[07:15:08] <Steve-Dusty> kk
[07:15:14] <Steve-Dusty> gonna figure
[07:15:19] <FunkyBob> next... student_set.id .... also makes no sense
[07:15:34] <FunkyBob> again, as the name suggests, it's a _set_ of records
[07:15:37] <FunkyBob> so there's no id
[07:16:11] <FunkyBob> so.. back to this increment... what are you trying to increment, and why?
[07:18:17] <FunkyBob> there's also a very odd inconsistency in your dashboard/ urls
[07:18:53] <FunkyBob> for addstudent the pk appears to refer to the class... but for students the pk is for a student
[07:19:04] <FunkyBob> at least, from the names... I can't see the views

[07:26:08] <Steve-Dusty> I want it to return back to the Class detail view
[07:26:18] <FunkyBob> want what to increment?
[07:26:46] <Steve-Dusty> look. /dashboard/14/addStudent. when I make this POST request, it'll come back to /dashboard/15
[07:26:50] <Steve-Dusty> not /dashboard14
[07:26:55] <FunkyBob> are you redirecting to the student PK, and then annoyed that it's not the Class PK?
[07:27:04] <Steve-Dusty> yes
[07:27:07] <FunkyBob> well
[07:27:11] <Steve-Dusty> WAIT
[07:27:12] <FunkyBob> redirectr to the class, not the student.
[07:27:15] <Steve-Dusty> student pk doesnt have a path
[07:27:27] <Steve-Dusty> it's just the detail view of Class
[07:27:28] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty: you'd enever know, from your url pattern names
[07:27:36] <FunkyBob> again, I can't see your views
[07:27:46] <FunkyBob> so I don't knwo if you fixed up that mess from yesterday
[07:28:16] <Steve-Dusty> yes i did, I didn't send the views?
[07:28:18] <Steve-Dusty> oh oops
[07:28:32] <Steve-Dusty> https://dpaste.org/SatQ
[07:29:44] <FunkyBob> so... so for the ClassDetailView you want the class.pk
[07:30:47] <Steve-Dusty> I put class.pk in models?
[07:31:17] <FunkyBob> wat?
[07:31:26] <FunkyBob> so consider this rework of your urls and view names:
[07:31:27] <FunkyBob> https://dpaste.org/jOGd
[07:31:48] <Steve-Dusty> was my names bad
[07:31:50] <FunkyBob> alternatively put the verb first... 'create-class-student'
[07:31:55] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty: because they were misleading
[07:32:20] <FunkyBob> DashboardListView was a list of Classes, not Dashboards...
[07:32:25] <Steve-Dusty> is there an order of how i should place my urls?
[07:32:52] <FunkyBob> mostly only subtlety points
[07:33:01] <FunkyBob> that ordering is a bit more logical, following least to most specific
[07:33:52] <FunkyBob> does the Student model really have a class-name field?
[07:34:02] <FunkyBob> oh.. again, misleading
[07:34:10] <FunkyBob> class_name is a Fkey to Class...
[07:34:16] <FunkyBob> so it specifies the Class... not just the name
[07:35:40] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty: hello?
[07:35:45] <Steve-Dusty> Hi yes I read
[07:35:54] <Steve-Dusty> I'm just changing the urls first
[07:37:55] <Steve-Dusty> did you change the View class names?
[07:38:10] <Steve-Dusty> wait nvm you couldn't have
[07:38:11] <FunkyBob> yes
[07:38:15] <Steve-Dusty> oh

[07:43:00] <FunkyBob> ok... so you're creating a new student, and assigning them to a Class [since student's class fkey can't be null]
[07:43:47] <FunkyBob> oh, also, you're going to have "fun" trying to call any field or variable 'class' ...
[07:43:54] <FunkyBob> * no fun at all, just pain and misery

[07:47:08] <Steve-Dusty> yes I am..

[07:52:11] <FunkyBob> no, you don't put the class in the form
[07:52:21] <FunkyBob> you only put in the form fields you want the end user to be able to edit
[07:54:57] <FunkyBob> what you will want to do is override form_valid to set the field
[07:55:22] <FunkyBob> but you'll also be wanting to override dispatch on that view to get the class for that pk [and by using get-object-or-404 verifying it's a valid pk]

[12:42:36] <aidos> Anyone with forms voodoo skills want to take a stab at suggesting a direction for making a modelform_factory equivilant that respects the `fields` kwarg when a base form is passed? https://dpaste.org/d3ga you can see the fields=('name', ) has no impact because it's a base_field on the modelform.
[12:43:15] <hemebond> I couldn't actually see in the code why that didn't work. My Python skill is apparently pants.
[12:43:48] <aidos> It works, it doesn't respect the fields= param
[12:44:24] <hemebond> That's the part that didn't seem to work. Because I see the fields attr being passed around.
[12:44:34] <hemebond> (from reading the code that is, not debugging)
[12:48:10] <aidos> If you `print(self.fields.keys())` you'll see ('name', 'author')
[12:48:25] <aidos> I need something that'll pop author off the form
[12:48:34] <hemebond> Yeah, but I'm failing to see in the code where that happens.
[12:49:14] <hemebond> Oh, unless it's this line Meta = type('Meta', bases, attrs)
[12:57:38] <hemebond> Oh interesting. When I use it to create a form with just one field, I still get two, a foreignkey field.
[12:58:16] <hemebond> In fact that field is always included, regardless of what I provide in fields.
[12:58:40] <hemebond> So it is working, but for some reason it's still including an extra, specific field.

[19:53:36] <Safa_[A_Boy]> Using integer ids instead of uuids, and having uuids as another field we expose to the user. What about relationships then? The user will get the integer id?
[19:53:51] <Safa_[A_Boy]> Oh no, not you.. My mistake, it was for FunkyBob :)
[19:54:25] <GinFuyou> Not sure I'm following?
[19:54:57] <GinFuyou> If you mean foreignkeys I believe they by default refer to whatever is a primary key
[19:56:33] <Safa_[A_Boy]> No, FunkyBob was saying that I should use integer primary keys instead of UUID primary keys, so I thought about relationships. I mistook you and him for the "Fu"+"y" :)
[19:58:20] <GinFuyou> Yeah, I'm not following what you thought about relationships. I also heard an advice to prefer surrogate keys, and I'm inclined to believe that

[20:04:02] <Safa_[A_Boy]> I mean if we have user model defined as pk=2, uuid=aaaa-aaaa-aaa-aaaa, and purchase references user, then the value of user in any purchase is 2, and that's what we expose to the user, unless we join the user table and expose the uuid field instead, which can cause a huge amount of joins.
[20:06:05] <GinFuyou> Why it is huge amount of joins? You can change reference to uuid I think, but why?
