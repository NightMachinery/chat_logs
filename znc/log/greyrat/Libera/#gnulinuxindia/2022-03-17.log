[13:38:02] <NeoVoid[m]> but the problem with that is we have to track manually each keys for each person and manually encrypt and decrypt our messages before sending them

[17:19:04] <PeroSar[m]> ofcourse
[17:24:12] <relejek[m]> Arya K:  also a FOSS project does not get that level of funding to burn on security framework and testing. that is huge undertaking from cost prospective that's why only VC level investors are going after this with a slim potential to monetize the app with a huge user base coz of UPI. 
[17:24:35] <relejek[m]> UPI is the milk.
[17:24:35] <relejek[m]> add-on services are the sugar, bread and butter
[17:26:51] <relejek[m]> sad part is the UPI apps with the largest user base(monetization potential) are owned by non-indian entities. eg. GooglePay, PhonePe, AmazonPay, Paytm?(can't confirm)
[17:28:23] <Aaron[m]1> Govt. has a official bhim app but ig people get cashbacks in other apps and are manipulated via ads thats why they use other apps

[22:18:32] <iamak[m]> <AryaK[m]> "Are there any FOSS UPI apps..." <- You can't have a FOSS app for UPI. The core library for UPI (the reason password screnes etc are same in all UPI apps) is closed source so it won't be truly FOSS. Also to use the library you need to create a token which will only be given to you if you are a bank.
[22:18:32] <iamak[m]> Best you can do is automate the USSD responses (*99#)
[22:21:43] <iamak[m]> <Tor[m]> "My father was angry at me..." <- Bruh I remember having to turn off mobile data because I was done using it. Now if I turn off internet, everyone losses their shit
[22:23:46] <Tor[m]> iamak[m]: I still do it lol 
[22:23:50] <Tor[m]> Saves battery
[22:24:01] <klimi[m]> yeah... i love not having mobile data

[22:24:55] <Tor[m]> klimi[m]: Pizza is expensive compared to street food 
[22:25:16] <klimi[m]> Tor[m]: street food? pizza is not street food?
[22:25:26] <Tor[m]> But i get the feeling
[22:25:53] <Tor[m]> klimi[m]: Ye here pizza as street food is just processed cheese and paneer
[22:26:02] <klimi[m]> mmm paneer
[22:26:02] <Tor[m]> With bad sauce
[22:26:14] <klimi[m]> damn i want paneer
[22:26:46] <Tor[m]> It's good but not on pizza (atleast not like they make it )
[22:28:40] <klimi[m]> yeah...
[22:28:51] <klimi[m]> but with sauce it's good
[22:29:01] <klimi[m]> maybe mango sauce
[22:31:44] <Tor[m]> Wat
[22:31:47] <Tor[m]> In pizza

[22:37:25] <iamak[m]> Working? Studying? Sleeping?
[22:37:26] <Tor[m]> It's our laziness
