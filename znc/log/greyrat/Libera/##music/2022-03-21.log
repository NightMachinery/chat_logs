[02:12:15] <morlog> was going to try and make a sail before I go but I'm lacking some key parts
[02:12:19] <LibertyDillo> so calm and beautiful at the moment, hard to imagine it storming hard 24 hours from now
[02:12:39] <morlog> storms going to hit at about 3am
[02:12:54] <LibertyDillo> tomorrow?
[02:13:04] <LibertyDillo> that is, Monday night?
[02:13:18] <morlog> yeah

[02:14:13] <LibertyDillo> good start
[02:14:45] <morlog> have almost everything thats supposed to go on the bike loaded
[02:15:13] <LibertyDillo> suppose you can always throw a tarp over it tied to the carport supports
[02:16:01] <LibertyDillo> I've got a cover for my scooter but it's acted like a sail sometimes in high winds and blown it over on its side

[02:50:39] <morlog> well, maybe just leave the raspi
[02:51:07] <morlog> atomicpi can be turned into a portable recording studio
[02:51:29] <piercedwater> niiice
[02:51:40] <piercedwater> i'm using an old laptop to record, when i get to that point
[02:51:47] <piercedwater> running Mint actually, per your recommendation
[02:52:02] <morlog> its funny, the atomicpi is newer than my laptop
[02:52:04] <piercedwater> so ez
[02:52:07] <piercedwater> ah
[02:52:18] <piercedwater> i've never used a computer like a pi/atomic, etc.
[02:52:28] <piercedwater> am i missing out?
[02:52:39] <morlog> its an x84/64 dev board so I dont have to switch between architectures
[02:53:05] <morlog> they can be fun for a bit but are impractical unless you have a specific job for them
[02:53:12] <piercedwater> hmm ok
[02:53:24] <morlog> think the atomicpi will suit my needs better
[02:53:31] <piercedwater> when i see the portable screens for them, i think it would be fun to use them in that way
[02:53:41] <piercedwater> probablt jukebox maybe
[02:53:49] <piercedwater> yeah, gotta do what works
[02:53:51] <morlog> i have a portable 13.3" monitor for it

[04:33:25] <sublim20> though, gotta admit, its been kind of awesome watching 'macho men' get all bent out of shape due to the political beliefs of a kid
[04:33:33] <sublim20> snowflakes gonna snowflake.
[04:34:40] <MusicalDillo> She has every right to complain about the crap sandwich that's been handed her generation, but I think her focus is misplaced.
[04:36:09] <sublim20> wait, are you telling me that kids dont have a full grasp on the world?
[04:37:30] <MusicalDillo> She's narrowly focused on 'climate change', but it's much bigger than that.  It's about how humans generally live and interact with the biosphere.
[04:37:53] <MusicalDillo> and on that note I will resume the channel ##music :)

[06:41:43] <Panther> When French King Louis XIV died in 1715, his stomach was reportedly twice the size of the average human. Louis was known for his voracious appetite, but little did he know that three-quarters of a century after his death, one of his organs would become a meal of its own. William Buckland, a geologist and the Dean of Westminster, ate his heart.
