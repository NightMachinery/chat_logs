[01:47:52] <Deep3D> If I have set up ZNC on a VM with multiple IP addresses, both v4 and v6. Have set up A records and rDNS. Can I force an IP on a new ZNC account with BindHost set so I get the right vhost?
[01:48:31] <Deep3D> Han 1 ZNC accound manage multiple domanenames on diffrent users is a way of asking also
[01:49:36] <MetaNova> users can have default bindhosts (which apply to all networks the user has defined) or bindhosts can be set per-network
[01:50:18] <MetaNova> if you want each user to have their own bindhost, then, define the bindhost for each user ..
[01:51:02] <Deep3D> as I toght, just not setting it up right I think. My accound work, but trying to set up my frinds accound at my ZNC network
[01:51:29] <MetaNova> are you an Admin user?
[01:52:05] <Deep3D> yes
[01:52:19] <MetaNova> /msg *status loadmod controlpanel
[01:52:37] <MetaNova> /msg *controlpanel get bindhost <user>
[01:52:47] <MetaNova> replace <user> with their username
[01:52:53] <MetaNova> show me what the output is
[01:53:03] <Deep3D> 2sek
[01:55:02] <Deep3D> <*controlpanel> BindHost = vnc.reactorscript.com
[01:55:46] <MetaNova> Deep3D: the forward DNS for vnc.reactorscript.com is -> 213.162.246.194
[01:55:57] <Deep3D> Can I get ZNC to prefer a IP aswell.. I See now tha its on wrong iP.
[01:56:02] <MetaNova> the rDNS (PTR) for 213.162.246.194 is -> irc.deepnet.no however
[01:56:08] <Deep3D> i know
[01:56:15] <Deep3D> just released :P
[01:56:15] <MetaNova> this is the problem.
[01:56:47] <Deep3D> I have more IP avable om my VM:
[01:56:59] <Deep3D> I can change that user over at another IP
[01:57:02] <Deep3D> but not sre
[01:57:04] <Deep3D> sure
[01:57:18] <MetaNova> the forward and reverse DNS needs to match for networks such as Libera to actually display them as the user's host
[01:57:33] <MetaNova> the problem isn't the user, ZNC, or the VM
[01:57:42] <MetaNova> it's your domain management
[01:58:19] <Deep3D> the problem is that I need to change IP on my friends accound in ZNC. then set the right vhost on him.
[01:58:49] <MetaNova> what is stopping you?
[01:59:13] <Deep3D> My skills.
[01:59:30] <Deep3D> Learning, its new to me with ZNC and vhosts
[01:59:35] <MetaNova> 1) make sure forward and reverse DNS match for each domain <-> IP
[01:59:37] <Deep3D> and VM
[02:00:12] <MetaNova> 2) set each user to a different bindhost domain, or IP: /msg *controlpanel set bindhost <user> <bindhost>
[02:00:16] <MetaNova> it's that simple

[02:03:09] <Deep3D> I can only have one rDNS each IP. And if I as user 1 want Deep3D@vhost.com and my friend praut@blasdad.com. I not shore do assign IP to diffrent users so the rDNS would work.
[02:03:30] <MetaNova> I don't know what vhost.com is
[02:03:49] <Deep3D> sorry
[02:03:52] <Deep3D> just random
[02:03:53] <MetaNova> but to make things work, you need each A (or AAAA record) to match with each PTR (rDNS) record
[02:03:59] <Deep3D> could been blablatesttest.test
[02:04:08] <MetaNova> if you are limited to one rDNS for your account, well
[02:04:13] <MetaNova> you're limited to one rDNS for your account
[02:04:25] <MetaNova> and nothing ZNC can do will help you circumvent this
[02:04:34] <MetaNova> I already explained what you need to do
[02:04:53] <MetaNova> if you do not have control over both the A (or AAAA) and PTR, then stop what you're doing
[02:05:02] <MetaNova> because nothing you will try is going to work
[02:05:11] <MetaNova> and find something else to spend your energy on
[02:05:12] <Deep3D> So what I shound do it so set up a new ZNC on a new accound on my VM. And then set up that way=
[02:06:03] <MetaNova> to manage multiple "vhosts" you require multiple (sub.)domains and multiple A (or AAAA) records, and to make sure the PTR for each IP matches
[02:06:06] <Deep3D> new user in linux VM and assignt that account with another ip

[02:06:20] <MetaNova> whatever convoluted way you want to try to go about that is up to you
[02:06:47] <MetaNova> I should state that I do not condone you violating any AuP of whatever service (including vhost.com) and if you are considering doing so, don't
[02:07:02] <style> question. my vps got ddosed, IP nullrouted and now the vps is up & running (happened some hours ago), but... the znc isnt connecting to IRC even if up. I get this error: <*status> IRC connection timed out.  Reconnecting...
[02:07:13] <MetaNova> but this is a trivial matter when you both own the domain, and have direct control over the PTRs
[02:07:19] <style> anything I can do to make them reconnect?
[02:07:24] <style> is something stuck somewhere?
[02:07:28] <MetaNova> style: kill the process
[02:07:32] <Deep3D> vhost.com I did not know about, it was just a example
[02:07:34] <style> done that
[02:07:37] <style> but still
[02:07:39] <MetaNova> start it fresh, make sure it's not confused by past erros
[02:07:39] <style> same thing
[02:07:48] <MetaNova> style: okay, confirm connectivity elsewhere
[02:07:59] <style> start it fresh ?
[02:08:10] <MetaNova> try resolving some domains, do a traceroute, ping a host
[02:08:10] <style> i killed the process & just ./znc it again
[02:08:19] <MetaNova> connect to IRC with irssi I don't care what you do
[02:08:28] <MetaNova> but prove your connection works before blaming ZNC
[02:08:54] <style> try something else, less mirc? :)
[02:09:01] <style> can be the program ?
[02:09:08] <Deep3D> Thanks for your time and help MetaNova

[15:08:40] <bookworm> you should probably do that with some sort of hypervisor, but it's an option yes
[15:09:03] <bookworm> in that case znc will immediately double fork into the background
