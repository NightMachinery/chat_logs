[00:00:05] <huf> it can be tricky to parse sequences of s, z, sz and zs in edge cases :)
[00:00:09] <blkshp> I meant to ask... Are their kettles for boiling water (I may have drunkenly asked this before)
[00:00:11] <Rashad> Legend has it that in the ancient times Arabs named their offspring at the moment they were born from the "surrounding" objects.
[00:00:18] <blkshp> In Hungary I mean.
[00:00:23] <Me-me> huf: Is the sz pronounced like a soft j?
[00:00:32] <Rashad> For example if there happened to be lightning when your son was born, you might want to call them "lightning"
[00:00:46] <huf> Me-me: no, sz is your s, s is your sh, z is your z and zs is your 's' in vision
[00:00:57] <blkshp> People have named their children after the place when they were conceived.
[00:01:11] <Me-me> S in vision is how I imagined sz is pronounced.
[00:01:20] <huf> yeah no, that's zs
[00:01:28] <Me-me> Interesting.

[21:16:25] <[itchyjunk]> Hey, I use the phrase "with a grain of salt". I think I know how to use it and the context, but I don't think I really know what it is about.
[21:16:48] <[itchyjunk]> For example, "Take what I say with a grain of salt".
[21:16:53] <[itchyjunk]> As in, take it lightly.
[21:16:59] <[itchyjunk]> But what does that expression really mean?
[21:17:58] <pussipupu> I say "pinch of salt" incidentally
[21:18:08] <pussipupu> and it means be at least a little sceptical
[21:22:46] <blkshp> +1 pinch of salt
[21:23:00] * blkshp throws it over his right shoulder.
[21:23:30] <blkshp> or maybe the left, one cannot remember.
[21:23:51] * LuisR18 grabs one of those grains and puts it on his food
[21:23:54] <blkshp> pussipupu: should I capitalise the 'o' in 'one' in the above sentence?
[21:24:24] <inhahe_> why the heck would you do that
[21:24:34] <LuisR18> pinch of salt comprising a few grains :>
[21:24:55] <pussipupu> you should absolutely not do so
[21:25:02] <blkshp> That's what I thought.
[21:25:18] <pussipupu> Ooh, House of Pain came on
[21:25:59] <pussipupu> (I think grain of salt is more AmE and pinch more BrE, dunno about other dialects)
[21:28:07] *** Joins: The_Blode (~Blode@user/the-blode/x-7164444)
[21:28:09] <LuisR18> a grain is pretty discrete, compared to a pinch :3
[21:28:38] <blkshp> It's also undetectable.
[21:28:45] <inhahe_> so americans sayings should be taken with less skepticism than britons sayings
[21:28:50] <LuisR18> indee
[21:28:52] <LuisR18> d
[21:28:52] <blkshp> But this is from the people who "could care less" xD
[21:29:07] <blkshp> inhahe_: please capitalise where appropriate.
[21:30:39] <LuisR18> you can't detect what i say! ... since you gotta take it with a grain :>
[21:31:07] * blkshp throws a bucket of grain at LuisR18
[21:31:12] <blkshp> (still in the bucket)
[21:31:21] <LuisR18> :P
[21:31:25] <blkshp> xD
[21:35:26] <pussipupu> Maybe they're using kosher salt
[21:35:35] <pussipupu> which has pretty large grains

[23:17:38] <no_gravity> Good Evening
[23:18:09] <blkshp> Greetings.
[23:18:12] <no_gravity> When you build a search engine to compete with Google, can you say "I am taking on Google"?
[23:18:18] <no_gravity> Or does that mean something different?
[23:18:33] <blkshp> You can, if you intend to be direct competition
[23:19:22] <no_gravity> blkshp: Direct competition in the sense that users will be using my search engine instead of Google.
[23:20:05] <blkshp> "you're taking on Google" if you specifically intend to be their competion. You want to beat them to the finish. You want to destroy them and ensure you're the winner.
[23:20:26] <blkshp> Like in a boxing match, one boxer takes on another.
[23:21:11] <no_gravity> Well, I want to use "I am taking on Google and I already have one user" as a title of a text about a search engine I wrote and use myself.
[23:21:35] <blkshp> I wouldn't.
[23:21:47] <no_gravity> Why not?
[23:22:24] <blkshp> Because it's not the right expression.
[23:22:49] <no_gravity> From your description, I would think it is?
[23:23:10] <blkshp> Do you intend to put Google out of business?
[23:23:18] <blkshp> or be their equal?
[23:23:32] <no_gravity> There is a tad of humor in the title.
[23:23:52] <no_gravity> As the text will describe a tiny search enging written in a weekend.
[23:24:25] <no_gravity> To call that "taking on Google" is kinda ... an exaggeration?
[23:25:04] <blkshp> Ok.
[23:25:13] <blkshp> People may laugh, yes.

[23:58:19] <[itchyjunk]> :<
[23:58:38] <TimMc> ^ Possible origin here, but we don't have the full evolution to the modern meaning, at least not according to this page.
[23:58:51] <[itchyjunk]> "The idea comes from the fact that food is more easily swallowed if taken with a small amount of salt."
[23:58:57] <[itchyjunk]> that's how i thought of it.
[23:59:21] <[itchyjunk]> I see, so we use phrases and we assume certain meaning to it but we don't really know how or why it came to be.
[23:59:34] * [itchyjunk] takes idioms with a grain of salt then.
