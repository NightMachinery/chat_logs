[03:09:46] <morlog> if it's out of stock there are a few others I really like

[07:57:47] <piercedwater> ah yeah guess so re: game
[07:58:16] <riff-IRC> so I got an APC SMT2200 UPS last weekend for the price of shipping and a battery pack
[07:58:25] <piercedwater> nice!
[07:58:28] <riff-IRC> yep
[07:58:30] <piercedwater> how many plugs
[07:58:35] <riff-IRC> $430 total
[07:58:40] <piercedwater> outlets i mean
[07:58:49] <riff-IRC> 10 outlets spread across 2 banks
[07:58:53] <piercedwater> niiiice
[07:59:19] <piercedwater> what ya going to backup?
[07:59:22] <piercedwater> if i may ask
[07:59:54] <riff-IRC> main workstation setup
[08:00:35] <riff-IRC> It draws about 500-550W under high loads
[08:00:38] <piercedwater> good idea, i'd say
[08:00:42] <piercedwater> oh wow
[08:00:43] <riff-IRC> yep
[08:00:49] <piercedwater> damn man
[08:00:55] <piercedwater> lol 500W
[08:01:00] <piercedwater> @.@
[08:01:00] <riff-IRC> the UPS can support 1.9kW of load
[08:01:21] <piercedwater> cool
[08:01:32] <piercedwater> plenty of headroom then
[08:01:40] <piercedwater> for now ;)
[08:01:42] <riff-IRC> upgraded the firmware on it earlier this evening, what an adventure that was
[08:01:45] <riff-IRC> yea
[08:02:01] <piercedwater> ah never done that before on a UPS
[08:02:16] <piercedwater> did it require Windowze?
[08:02:23] <riff-IRC> yep
[08:02:28] <piercedwater> sorry m8 ;(
[08:02:36] <riff-IRC> And a *HARDWARE SERIAL PORT*
[08:02:42] <piercedwater> oh wow
[08:02:52] <riff-IRC> APC's documentation explicitly calls out not using an adapter
[08:03:19] <riff-IRC> So I made my own RJ45 to DB-9F adapter to communicate with it
[08:03:25] <piercedwater> :)
[08:03:34] <riff-IRC> soldered and heatshrinked, too
[08:03:35] <piercedwater> this is why i love irc
[08:03:53] <riff-IRC> why?
[08:04:12] <piercedwater> people do things like that on here. they don't just go out and find a place to buy it, they make it
[08:04:17] <riff-IRC> yep
[08:05:02] <piercedwater> so all went well i assume?
[08:05:07] <riff-IRC> yep
[08:05:25] <riff-IRC> Had to use my Athlon 64 desktop system to perform the upgrade
[08:05:37] <piercedwater> awesome

[08:09:02] <piercedwater> :(
[08:09:14] <riff-IRC> Two-fold problem there:
[08:09:21] <piercedwater> those connectors look good to my eyes
[08:09:37] <riff-IRC> 1) My main computer normally sits there, but I had to remove it to give the A64 system somewhere to go
[08:10:03] <riff-IRC> 2) Sourcing power from an alternate outlet (the UPS dropped load when it did the upgrade)
[08:10:05] <riff-IRC> and thankks
[08:10:21] <piercedwater> connectors look damn good actually after second look
[08:10:30] <piercedwater> well that's good it worked for ya
[08:11:44] <riff-IRC> yep
[08:12:05] <piercedwater> i'm just working on my music library by tagging
[08:12:13] <piercedwater> nothing technical or nerdy really
[08:12:18] * riff-IRC nods
[08:12:22] <riff-IRC> been there done that
[08:12:27] <piercedwater> yep
[08:16:08] <piercedwater> got any more cool projects lined up now that the UPS is taken care of?
[08:17:33] <riff-IRC> not sure... still dealing with the UPS 
[08:17:39] <piercedwater> oh whoops
[08:17:57] <riff-IRC> the hardware is so old that it can't accept any firmware higher than 7.1, so no Modbus
[08:18:43] <riff-IRC> gonna eBay an AP9631 card that can take the v6.5 firmware needed to enable Modbus (for use with APCUPSD)
[08:18:54] <piercedwater> right on
[08:24:04] <riff-IRC> if there's one thing I'm *NOT* paying APC prices for (other than battery packs), it's NMC cards.
[08:25:04] * piercedwater nods
[08:25:41] <riff-IRC> https://www.ebay.com/itm/325046537861 $32, serial shows 2017 mfg
[08:25:43] <Janet> ^ AP9631 UPS Smart Slot Network Management Card 2 TESTED (640-1110B-Z Rev06) | eBay
[08:26:28] <riff-IRC> so it should be able to be upgraded well past v6.5, if it hasn't already been taken that far
[08:27:29] <piercedwater> sounds like a winner
[08:27:36] <riff-IRC> yep
[08:27:46] <riff-IRC> paycheck hits in 3 days
[08:27:49] <piercedwater> :D
[08:28:12] <riff-IRC> but there's plenty in the bank for a $32 NMC card
[08:28:24] <piercedwater> i gotta wait a bit for mine although I must say your project is spinning the hamster wheels in my head to come up with a new project or two
[08:28:30] * riff-IRC nods
[08:35:51] <riff-IRC> this UPS has been on batteries for nearly an hour now and shows no signs of stopping
[08:36:08] <riff-IRC> battery at 32%
[08:36:50] <piercedwater> hmm
[08:39:34] <piercedwater> what kind of load do you have on it currently?
[08:40:31] <riff-IRC> 17% and holding steady
[08:40:45] <riff-IRC> (load)
[08:42:26] <riff-IRC> just bought an AP9631 card
[08:42:32] <riff-IRC> $34
[08:51:31] <riff-IRC> piercedwater: Battery calibration test passed
[08:52:13] <piercedwater> nice! my UPS lasts 5 minutes if I'm lucky with current load. should prob lighten it a bit
[08:52:21] <riff-IRC> yea
[08:52:24] <piercedwater> or get a better UPS heh
[08:52:46] <riff-IRC> the one on my Tech Room will go for around 45m on battery power when everything shuts down like it ought to
