[00:27:47] <Brekkjern> The translation is accurate, but the tone is just completely off...

[00:44:06] <Brekkjern> Only one that comes to mind is the one for Ice Age. Norwegian one is legit better than the original.
[00:46:05] <Brekkjern> That said, I don't normally watch the dubbed versions
[00:46:14] <Brekkjern> Oh, the Shrek dub was also pretty good

[06:29:54] <manicennui> Oh no!
[06:32:57] <manicennui> "Pet-food sales at supermarkets grew 6.9% over the past 52 weeks ended Nov. 27, compared with 2.3% for food overall, according to firm NielsenIQ."
[06:35:45] <companion_cube> time to invest in Nullo
[06:36:22] <manicennui> ?
[06:40:56] <indigo> manicennui: I wonder if that's by volume or price
[06:41:23] <manicennui> And did the population grow by 2.3%, or are we pigging out?
[06:41:24] <indigo> Because inflation has been hitting food prices lately
[06:41:36] <indigo> I guess the solution is to just not eat
[06:42:02] <manicennui> People will need to sacrifice so we can feed kitties.
[06:42:41] <manicennui> ha
[06:42:46] <manicennui> They used a photo of grumpy cat.
[06:43:31] <manicennui> "Still, it has been two months since Ms. Barnoschi has found Spinoza’s preferred variety. Spinoza—named after a graduate course on the philosopher—settles for poultry and beef-flavored food, but doesn’t purr or lick up morsels after meals."

[07:09:33] <manicennui> Yeah, who thought working was a good idea?
[07:10:38] <bkero> Not those in /r/antiwork
[07:15:07] <Church> manicennui: Yeah I want another two weeks~
[07:15:24] <manicennui> I want the next 20 years.
[07:15:50] <manicennui> I gave them over 25 years.
[07:16:12] <Church> Heh haven't gotten that much out of me yet
[07:16:42] <dminkovsky> It is useless to pursue the world, No one will ever overtake it
[07:21:43] <manicennui> In two more years I get another 4-week sabbatical!
[07:26:38] <manicennui> https://i.redd.it/dka9oy279c981.jpg
[07:26:42] <imode> Amazon has 2 years from me now.
[07:27:14] <Church> Heh https://i.redd.it/boottfzwob981.jpg
[07:27:23] <manicennui> I'm at 7 years. We get a 4-week sabbatical after 4 years, and then ever 5 years after that.
[07:27:28] <Church> imode: Yeah 3 years at my company come another month.
[07:27:37] <imode> what a wild ride.
[07:27:40] <imode> time doesn't seem to make sense.
[07:27:48] <imode> I could stay here another 2 years.
[07:28:00] <manicennui> I really like the sabbatical idea, but I wish it were more often.
[07:28:04] <manicennui> Like every 3 years.
[07:28:07] <Church> I can't complain honestly. I'm not overworked, my manager badgers me to take breaks and vacations, pay is decent given my skill level and lack of degree, etc.
[07:28:16] <manicennui> I also get 26 days of PTO now.
[07:28:17] <Church> Work is interesting, etc
[07:28:20] <Church> manicennui: Nice
[07:28:23] <imode> manicennui: damn really?
[07:28:27] <imode> we get more than that.
[07:28:29] <Church> We do that "unlimited" PTO thing
[07:28:31] <manicennui> Yeah.
[07:28:38] <imode> I could take all of January off.
[07:28:42] <manicennui> The thing is, we get a lot of other time off.
[07:28:57] <manicennui> They are super lenient about taking half the day off for something.
[07:29:05] <manicennui> And during the summer we end work at 2 on Fridays.
[07:29:17] <Church> Same
[07:29:21] <imode> same here. with WFH I can just zone the fuck out most days and work when I want.
[07:29:23] <manicennui> I'd prefer more PTO, but we really do get a lot of time off.
[07:29:24] <Church> We do that on alternating Fridays
[07:29:40] <imode> the _only_ disadvantage of this job is the oncall and the lower pay.
[07:29:46] <Church> imode: Pretty much. Long as I get my work done I'm liberal with breaks
[07:29:58] <Church> On-call is kinda annoying but no where as bad as yours I assume imode
[07:30:03] <Church> I've heard Amazon is hellish
[07:30:11] <imode> it has gotten.. easier lately.
[07:30:19] <imode> probably due to the holidays.
[07:30:21] <manicennui> I am on-call about once per month, but it almost never leads to my being called.
[07:30:24] <Church> I'm just annoyed we don't get paid anymore. New corp doesn't comp you for oncall
[07:30:26] <Church> Which bites
[07:30:41] <Church> I'm oncall every month and a half
[07:31:02] <Church> Probably gonna be about every two months~ once we add some more people to the pager rotation
[07:31:03] <manicennui> Our most important stuff happens during business hours.
[07:31:10] <manicennui> Rare for something important to happen during off hours.
[07:31:13] <Church> Although I'm technically always oncall for infrastructure shit
[07:31:15] <Church> Blegh
[07:31:19] <manicennui> Once in a while something happens right at the end of the day.
[07:31:27] <Church> I can't wait to get a peer in that department this year.
[07:31:51] <imode> we don't support sev 2 tickets, so anybody that sends us a sev 2 ticket, we get to kick them in the balls verbally.
[07:31:56] <Church> manicennui: I had a quarter of getting paged once or twice a week at 2am and being up an hour to deal with it
[07:31:59] <Church> That was hell

[07:37:10] <Church> Heh, glorious
[07:37:18] <Church> bkero: It was nothing internal technically.
[07:37:37] <Church> Our architecture at the time wasn't great with the data we had for that particular host
[07:37:45] <Church> The issue was a kernel bug on Linkde
[07:37:47] <Church> Linode*
[07:38:02] <Church> Their kernel engineer couldn't solve it for almost two quarters
[07:38:09] <Church> Finally pushed us off to AWS
[07:38:17] <Church> I was ready to throttle someone.
[07:41:14] <bkero> one of my favorite old videos
[07:41:23] <bkero> of internal google shiz
[07:42:09] <manicennui> Wow. I forgot about app engine.
[07:42:22] <Church> As did I, it... worked?
[07:42:32] <Church> That's all I have to say on that.
[07:42:45] <Church> bkero: I really want more internal Google vidz to surface
[07:43:06] <imode> we have a promotional video for our org.
[07:43:10] <imode> that's nothing but corgis.
[07:56:23] <Church> Oooh
[07:56:32] <Church> I have seen so many cringe internal videos at work
[07:56:42] <Church> That we do for EOY pat on the back shit
[07:59:41] <Church> Oh man that dep hell patchset fix for the kernel... I want it so badly.
[08:00:04] <Church> It takes me 12~ hours to cross compile a kernel for arm64 currently. And that's on a nice i7 cpu
[08:00:31] <Church> Fucking qemu penalty, and fscking docker on top of that.
[08:01:56] <imode> 12?!
[08:02:11] <imode> jesus
[08:09:24] <bkero> That's a lot.
[08:10:10] <Church> Eyep
[08:10:23] <Church> imode: With quemu on my laptop it took 4 hours
[08:11:08] <Church> I guess dockerizing it (because I build all closures/packages for my home network at once) is a bit too much overhead
[08:11:24] <Church> Thankfully have a small arm64 machine I can add to Gitlab for arm builds soon.
[08:13:22] <manicennui> Get a threadripper.
[08:13:39] <manicennui> Use your entire bathtub to water cool it.
[08:13:43] <bkero> My 5900X can chew through qemu-arm64 quite well
[08:14:12] <manicennui> Maybe someday we will fix the supply issues and I'll build another computer.
[08:14:48] <Church> Yeah all my servers are low power skullcanyon i7 NUCs
[08:15:09] <bkero> oh
[08:15:12] <bkero> mobile skylake parts
[08:15:20] <bkero> That explains it
[08:15:21] <Church> And some misc stuff, rk3399 for my NAS, apu2 for the router, etc
[08:15:23] <Church> Ye
[08:15:44] <Church> Perfectly serviceable stuff honestly, and tiny form factor which is great in my apartment.
[08:16:03] <Church> But with enough indirection builds get... eh
[08:16:07] <bkero> Yep those should be plenty fast
[08:16:20] <bkero> arm complications shouldn't be 100x slower though
[08:17:00] <Church> Yeah not sure, probably some bugs somewhere...
[08:17:15] <Church> But full rebuilds should only happen like... once a year I think.
[08:17:47] <Church> And offloading the kernel to my arm Gitlab runner will speed my full rebuild of my home network to like two hours then.
[09:11:35] <imode> if you had to use only a single data structure, like lists, maps, arrays, etc., for all of your programs, what would you choose.
[09:12:34] <bkero> AVL tree
[09:14:24] <Church> imode: But I do, Lua arrays are all you need
[09:14:39] <imode> which are basically maps. :P
[09:19:24] <manicennui> Yeah, hashmaps for everything.
[09:19:26] <Church> Shhh :p
[09:20:28] <manicennui> Isn't everything an associative array in PHP?
[09:21:03] <bkero> even booleans? probably
[09:21:19] <manicennui> I mean both arrays and hashes.

[18:49:46] <gthm> it's my first day back from vacation, so I've just read some emails
[18:50:23] <gthm> well, it's lockdown in NL and schools are closed so both kids are at home, so the first half of the day went into taking care of them
[18:52:18] <gwozniak> It's technically a holiday for me, but my wife had to go to work so I'm doing some little things for work
[18:52:30] <gwozniak> like a little bit of file management
[18:56:33] <gwozniak> And on the side, slowly ripping my CD collection
[18:57:10] * manicennui remembers doing that
[18:57:30] <manicennui> Is that service still up with all of the album/track info?
[18:58:08] <manicennui> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDDB
[18:58:08] <buttsbot> CDDB - Wikipedia
[18:59:38] <manicennui> Looks like it might be commercial now.
[18:59:42] <manicennui> Another Internet thing ruined.
[19:01:27] <epilys> discogs/musicbrainz
[19:02:41] <gwozniak> Musicbrainz is okay.  Lots of duplicates, it seems.
[19:02:54] <gwozniak> I have a bunch of stuff that isn't in that database, tho
[19:03:01] <gwozniak> And adding to it is a real chore
[19:03:31] <dminkovsky> ripping CDs is my kind of data entry
[19:05:13] <dminkovsky> how many CDs do you have
[19:05:21] <dminkovsky> surprising you never ripped your CDs before this?
[19:06:15] <gwozniak> I did, but I ripped them to mp3 years ago and I'm doing it to flac now
[19:07:02] <dminkovsky> yeah
[19:07:03] <dminkovsky> nice
[19:07:21] <gwozniak> somewhere around 100 CDs
[19:07:37] <epilys> i've only ripped CDs to get what.cd bounties
[19:07:49] <epilys> oh the memories
[19:07:57] <gwozniak> I've had more over the years but have probably lost as many as I currently have
[19:07:59] <dminkovsky> RIP :teardrop:
[19:20:58] <epilys> One time I ripped a vinyl-only release for what.cd
[19:21:07] <epilys> and a week later it was all over youtube :D
[19:22:28] <Brekkjern> Man... Spotify's Discover Weekly playlist can be so ridiculously hit or miss... I've been listening to the music from Arcane a bit lately and now Spotify thinks that I like all types of orchestral movie music.
[19:22:49] <Brekkjern> Like, the entire playlist is mostly stuff that would fit in an epic scene in a movie or tv show
[19:22:55] <gwozniak> I don't know what 'what.cd' even is
[19:23:18] <epilys> it has a wikipedia page
[19:25:10] <ngoldbaum> epilys: RIAA comin’ 4 u
[19:25:19] * ngoldbaum misses oinks pink palace
[19:25:54] <epilys> molon lave
[19:27:56] <gwozniak> I was never into the torrenting thing, so that's probably why I have never heard of it
[19:29:07] <Brekkjern> After Spotify came out I pretty much ditched music torrents and CDs
[19:29:33] <Brekkjern> I had a small CD collection before I started torrenting, but it was so inconvenient of a medium
[19:30:07] <Brekkjern> Especially when I used an mp3 player and had to rip the CDs anyways. Why not skip the middle step and just get the mp3 directly? :P
[19:30:36] <epilys> https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DosOK_4W0AURKA2?format=jpg&name=900x900
[19:30:58] <epilys> Well I for one wanted to pay the artists
[19:31:04] <gwozniak> I like having a physical copy
[19:31:12] <epilys> that too is nice
[19:31:16] <gwozniak> But it does take up space
[19:31:21] <epilys> especially an aesthetic one, like a cassette or vinyl
[19:31:27] <epilys> CD is meh
[19:32:00] <gwozniak> I also appreciate the information in the CD/vinyl case, which usually doesn't come with the digital version
[19:32:03] * epilys has too much cassette and tapes
[19:32:19] <gwozniak> Sorry, but cassette striaght up sucks ;)
[19:32:22] <Brekkjern> epilys: I too want legal copies. That's pretty much why I stopped torrenting when Spotify came out
[19:32:26] <epilys> some tapes I have came with incense sticks, or the artist's blood
[19:32:41] <Brekkjern> It was more convenient, legal, and the artists got some payment at least.
[19:32:42] <gwozniak> Having lived through the cassette era, I don't know why people feel the need to repeat it
[19:32:44] <epilys> gwozniak, the quality sure sucks, it's not about the music quality
[19:33:04] <epilys> it's about producing a cheap easy to come by copy for a few euros
[19:33:26] <epilys> I only buy tapes to support the artists btw
[19:33:42] <epilys> as with other media
[19:33:45] <gwozniak> I buy music on Bandcamp, for the most part
[19:33:49] <epilys> same
[19:34:04] <epilys> https://bandcamp.com/norn
[19:34:06] <buttsbot> norn's collection | Bandcamp
[19:34:15] <gwozniak> But only digital.  I don't have room for physical versions of all the music I buy
[19:34:38] <epilys> acceptable. do you have physical books?
[19:36:03] <gwozniak> Many
[19:36:17] <gwozniak> I don't like reading books online.  I have tried many times.
[19:36:30] <epilys> can't rip those anyways :p
[19:37:07] <manicennui> They should sell e-books with a 1-year license for far less money.
[19:37:07] <epilys> i moved in 2021, and the movers kept moaning about how heavy the boxes were (which in itself is unprofessional, isn't moving boxes your job?)
[19:37:21] <epilys> and they kept asking "what is in this box????"
[19:37:28] <epilys> they must have never moved a house with books before
[19:37:34] <manicennui> Paying the same amount for something you can't sell or give away and they can remove access to at any time really sucks.
[19:37:56] <manicennui> epilys: Did you pack large boxes full of books?
[19:37:57] <gwozniak> Yeah, ebooks kind of blow
[19:38:07] <gwozniak> manicennui: I was about to ask...
[19:38:08] <manicennui> I try to limit how many books I pack in one box.
[19:38:14] <epilys> manicennui, the smallest they gave me, actually
[19:38:39] <gwozniak> "Always put books in small boxes" is almost the #1 rule of moving
[19:39:01] <manicennui> I don't expect much from any services these days.
[19:39:08] <epilys> they were small and also, they "inspected" my stuff before they gave me boxes and giving me the price and go ahead
[19:39:14] <epilys> just bad at their job I guess
[19:42:12] <gwozniak> We have paid for movers the last 3 moves, but we pack our own stuff
[19:42:33] <gwozniak> And we get the boxes ourselves

[19:43:18] <gwozniak> The first time we used movers they did a shit job of estimating and it took them way longer than they thought.  We even warned them
[19:43:47] <epilys> gwozniak, ugh, that was my experience pretty much.
[19:44:59] <epilys> They kept saying "We will still accept the price we had agreed upon" like they were doing me a favor
[19:45:07] *** Joins: bontaq` (~user@ool-45779fe5.dyn.optonline.net)
[19:45:07] *** bontaq` is now known as bontaq
[19:45:35] <gwozniak> Yeah, and then the movers charged us nearly double their estimate
[19:46:39] <epilys> borderline scammy.
[19:46:57] <gwozniak> They were out of business shortly afterward, as I recall
[19:47:11] <ngoldbaum> i had a move go the other way, it took 4.5 hours and they estimated 8
[19:47:14] <ngoldbaum> was great
[19:47:27] <manicennui> I don't even know how you do that kind of service well. I imagine no one does it for long because of the physical wear.
[19:47:37] <gwozniak> The next moves we vetted the movers more carefully and things were better
[19:47:38] <manicennui> So even if you find some good people and train them, they probably aren't going to stay long.
[19:48:14] <gwozniak> It's pretty grueling
[19:49:04] <gwozniak> We always offer to help with loading and unloading, but I admit that I have not done it much because I have had to work (which is the reason we kept moving)
[19:49:34] <gwozniak> Kudos to my wife and sister-in-law who did all that stuff
[19:50:12] <gwozniak> I practically moved us once by myself and we had way more stuff than we thought
[19:50:25] <gwozniak> That was a rough day
[19:51:13] <epilys> There's always more stuff than you think.
[19:54:13] <gwozniak> This was considerably more.  I forgot about a bunch of stuff in the basement of the place we were staying (which was shared with another person)
[19:54:36] <gwozniak> We filled a truck that I thought was too big
[19:55:08] <manicennui> My body is just garbage and I live in a third-floor walk up.
[19:55:15] <manicennui> My last place was a third-floor walk up too.
[19:57:17] <manicennui> Done with walk up buildings.
[19:57:56] <epilys> WFH -> never go out
[20:01:28] <manicennui> Yeah, that is kind of what I do, but it makes things worse.
[20:01:32] <manicennui> I need to be more active.
[20:02:20] <epilys> I've been dealing with this quandary the entire 2021
[20:02:39] <epilys> there's nothing to do here if you don't work in an office and go out with friends in closed spaces
[20:04:21] <manicennui> I could walk around the neighborhood, or go pick up food instead of getting delivery.
[20:04:47] <epilys> get a dog!
[20:04:52] <manicennui> Nah
[20:04:59] <epilys> that's 80% of my physical activity
[20:05:21] <manicennui> I wouldn't have a dog in an apartment.
[20:05:56] <gwozniak> So many people have dogs in my building.  Some of them pretty big.
[20:06:16] <gwozniak> Not something I would want, tbh
[20:07:43] <indigo> Cats!!!
[20:07:44] <manicennui> People who have breeds like huskies in apartments are insane.
[20:10:05] <gwozniak> Most people who have dogs here have small dogs.  I think the ones with bigger dogs don't stay very long
[20:10:22] <manicennui> People across the hall from me have a medium sized dog.
[20:10:25] <gwozniak> indigo: yup :)
[20:10:28] <manicennui> Thing seems pretty high strung.
[20:10:49] <manicennui> Some kind of border collie mix or something.
[20:11:14] <indigo> One of my neighbors have a pair of Pomeranians
[20:11:29] <indigo> They’re pretty high strung :P
[20:11:51] <indigo> Stereotypical Poms
[20:15:07] <manicennui> "I had one boss, again a good boss, who used to not call candidates he was interested in and move them to next stages because if they were really interested they would call him. It was... odd."
[20:15:12] <manicennui> This seems like typical Boomer thinking.
[20:15:24] <manicennui> All of their job advice that was outdated 20 years ago.
[20:15:57] <manicennui> It's always sad when we interview someone (pre pandemic) and they'd show up in a suit.
[20:16:31] <manicennui> I wonder whether people put suits on for virtual interviews.
[20:16:40] <manicennui> s/virtual/remote/
[20:19:45] <epilys> my italian greyhound is 5kg and doesn't make a noise at all
[20:20:03] <manicennui> I've heard that greyhounds are super lazy most of the time.
[20:20:03] <epilys> fwiw
[20:20:10] <manicennui> Like Whippets
[20:20:11] <epilys> oh they are

[20:23:16] <manicennui> A friend has a whippet, and it is such a baby.
[20:23:39] <manicennui> When a bunch of us were over at his place, it would walk up to random people, want to be picked up, then go to sleep on their lap.
[20:24:38] <dminkovsky> mastadon is pretty sweet but what annoys me about it is that they just copied twitter
[20:24:42] <dminkovsky> and now it looks like old ass twitter
[20:25:02] <dminkovsky> why is twitter like the reference social platform
[20:25:46] <epilys> mastodon was specifically made like this
[20:26:02] <dminkovsky> i kinda get why gab, parler, truth.socaial would copy twitter like that but mastadon
[20:26:10] <dminkovsky> yeah i think it's lame
[20:26:21] <dminkovsky> i get it, but it sucks
[20:26:30] <epilys> are you talking about the default mastodon web ui?
[20:26:34] <epilys> i'm confused a bit
[20:26:41] <dminkovsky> yes it's just... twitter
[20:26:54] <gwozniak> Wee.  School has been moved to online here for 2 weeks
[20:27:16] <epilys> dminkovsky, you can use whatever client you like
[20:27:16] <dminkovsky> in all of canada?
[20:27:37] <dminkovsky> epilys: right but the backend is then just still serving the same data
[20:27:42] <dminkovsky> it's just a boring format to me
[20:27:51] <dminkovsky> i'm not talking about the specific icons they chose
[20:27:52] <gwozniak> dminkovsky: just Ontario
[20:28:01] <dminkovsky> gwozniak: poor parents
[20:28:18] <gwozniak> teachers don't like it either.  Online learning is a bust
[20:28:26] <dminkovsky> online learning is bullshit
[20:29:07] <dminkovsky> i'd rather my kid just watch TV
[20:29:12] <dminkovsky> if i had no other way of dealing with them
[20:29:20] <dminkovsky> which would be the case if my child as was old enough
[20:29:51] <dminkovsky> getting a child to sit in front a computer and do school seems... cruel
[20:30:00] <gwozniak> Kids hate it.  Teachers hate it.  Parents hate it.  Only the gov't likes the idea because they see it as a way to reduce costs
[20:30:36] <dminkovsky> i wish someone would push to make it illegal
[20:31:02] <gwozniak> Very few students benefit from it, and the ones that do tend to have very engaged parents
[20:31:17] <dminkovsky> how can any student over 15 or 16 do online school?
[20:31:29] <dminkovsky> maybe what, 12 it's possible to do online school?
[20:31:40] <dminkovsky> but the whole 7 year olds zooming lol wtf
[20:31:50] <gwozniak> Yeah, it's pretty much a joke
[20:32:07] <dminkovsky> s/over/under/
[20:32:37] <gwozniak> But even in the face of evidence against, I'm sure the tech powers that be and penny pinchers will look to foist it on people
[20:32:41] <manicennui> I didn't benefit much from actual school after 15 or 16.
[20:32:57] <dminkovsky> exactly
[20:33:16] <gwozniak> I liked school all the way to the end of high school
[20:33:16] <manicennui> I also graduated a semester early, and purposely did nothing in most of my classes for that semester.
[20:33:22] <dminkovsky> gwozniak: it's weird you need evidence for something so patently cruel
[20:33:47] <cb> online learning could work but it'd have to be planned and done explicitly
[20:33:49] <manicennui> I like the model that some countries have where some people are directed to the trades at that age.
[20:34:09] <cb> but doing it half-assed, last second, and keep oscillating between it and not is obviously not how you do it
[20:34:11] <manicennui> And I think software development should be considered a trade.
[20:34:13] <gwozniak> dminkovsky: it's because we have nimrods like Nicholas Negroponte who insist on silly ideas like OLPC in a slick and convincing way
[20:34:24] *** Joins: moose (~moose@user/moose)
[20:34:37] <dminkovsky> personally i wouldn't allow my child to do online learning whether it was planned or not
[20:34:40] <manicennui> People who make a fuckton of money from technology want technology to be the answer to education.
[20:34:45] <gwozniak> Yup
[20:35:08] <moose> I mean it's better than getting your family sick and dying tbh
[20:35:18] <dminkovsky> but why just... not have school?
[20:35:28] <gwozniak> It would benefit society greatly if we stopped taking the grand ideas of computerized education seriously
[20:35:39] <dminkovsky> i get that's a stupid question cause someone neesd to watch the kid but the teacher can't watch your kid over zoom
[20:35:40] <riv> yet you live in society
[20:35:44] <moose> dminkovsky: Because some learning is better than no learning
[20:35:53] <moose> Parents have the option of home schooling if they so desire.
[20:36:18] <moose> IDK if my send queue is high right now because I just connected, but I assume y'all are getting these in order :)
[20:37:06] <gwozniak> seems coherent so I'm guessing we are
[20:37:54] <moose> cool
[20:37:57] <moose> It's cleared now.
[20:38:12] <moose> But anyway I agree, tech industry is basically taking advantage as much as possible. But what's new?
[20:44:16] <gwozniak> And it's too bad that the online stuff is kind of the only option right now here, given that the infra changes needed to deal with ventilation and PPE haven't been addressed
[20:44:28] <gwozniak> Suspect this wave won't last long, though
[20:45:46] <gwozniak> The science council (that advises the gov't here, but doesn't set policy) says that the key is to just get the case load steady and prevent a rush of hospital admissions.  The case numbers are allowed to be high, if need be
[20:46:16] <gwozniak> The 3rd dose rollout is remarkably slow here
[20:46:35] <gwozniak> Like, it's totally something they could have planned for
[20:47:51] <gwozniak> But that costs money, and we don't want to spend that.  Better to send it to developers making shitty condos
[20:57:27] <moose> In the US it's largely gone back to normal.
[20:57:49] <moose> Not sure where you're at, but they're basically said "fuck it, COVID vaccine is required to attend school and we'll hope that's enough"
[20:58:56] <imode> it won't be enough now.
[20:59:13] <manicennui> gwozniak: In the US where we use the ER as a same day doctor visit, ERs are being overrun with people who don't have serious symptoms.
[20:59:28] <moose> imode: That's up for debate currently, not really anything saying one way or the other due to a lack of data.
[20:59:45] <imode> well, the rising case numbers due to omicron are pretty evident.
[20:59:53] <imode> that's mainly what I'm basing my judgement on.
[21:00:04] <imode> we blew past our peak in less than a week.
[21:00:35] <imode> we're vaccinated and _we_ expect to get it.
[21:00:43] <moose> Right but we don't even know if the omicron variant is dominant and we're not doing specific tests to isolate variants for even 1% of visits really.
[21:01:24] <moose> So yeah we see a new variant and our case rates shoot up, but that's not necessarily conclusive evidence that says "omicron is more contagious among vaccinated people"
[21:01:42] <moose> It is likely due to a combination of that plus a bunch of people gathering for the holidays, shopping, all of that.
[21:01:50] <gwozniak> Omicron will be about 90%+ of all cases here in a week, according to what I saw yesterday
[21:01:51] <imode> mm, not saying that. just saying that there's more of an ambient threat to vaccinated folks now.
[21:02:23] <imode> i.e cases among unvaccinated just _spiked_ like a motherfucker. cases among vaccinated haven't.
[21:02:48] <moose> imode: Fair enough. I definitely agree with that and so does the data. But breakthrough cases are indeed up as well.
[21:02:50] <imode> if the vaccines have a reduced efficacy, doesn't take much braining to say the number of cases will rise.
[21:02:54] <imode> yeah.
[21:03:25] <moose> It could be reduced efficacy, a lot more unvaccinated carriers, less but still significant numbers of vaccinated carriers, and mutations that are evading vaccines.
[21:03:25] <Xe> well, the main thing isn't the number of cases
[21:03:27] <imode> they're up, but they'll keep going up unless boosters/newly engineered doses are around.
[21:03:33] <Xe> it's the number of HOSPITALIZATIONS
[21:03:39] <companion_cube> I thought there was evidence omicron was more contagious, including in vaccinated people?
[21:03:46] <moose> Xe: Deaths and hospitalizations are still trending down here in the face of rising case rates.
[21:03:51] <Xe> the vaccines aren't designed to prevent you from getting sick or carrying it
[21:04:04] <Xe> they are designed to make you less likely to die from it
[21:04:06] <moose> Xe: But the fun part about that is, is that occupancy is skyrocketing.
[21:04:06] <manicennui> Of course they are.
[21:04:18] <imode> deaths aren't spiking alongside these.
[21:04:21] <moose> That tells me that we have a hospital staffing issue that is pretty substantial.
[21:04:33] <Xe> we've had one for years lol
[21:04:38] <moose> I mean even worse now.
[21:04:46] <gwozniak> Yes, the key is hospitalizations.  What is still unclear is how many we can expect if we let the virus run loose
[21:04:46] <moose> Hospital staffing has been a thing for decades in the US at least.
[21:04:55] <moose> gwozniak: "A lot" :)
[21:05:06] <gwozniak> moose: probably, yes
[21:05:07] <imode> so far the death count is low.
[21:05:11] <imode> which is.. good.
[21:05:15] <gwozniak> yup
[21:05:26] <moose> Yes. Viruses aren't designed to kill their host. They try to stay alive just like anything else.
[21:05:32] <moose> So over time it'll likely become less lethal.
[21:05:35] <gwozniak> all signs point to this being much less bad (with vaccinations) than previous strains
[21:05:40] <imode> one hopes.
[21:05:43] <moose> gwozniak: Not enough data to say that.
[21:06:00] <moose> We'll know in another 2-3 months though.
[21:06:12] <gwozniak> it's clearly less bad than delta at this point
[21:06:24] <moose> But there's also a massive amount of people who have been vaccinated.
[21:06:29] <moose> When delta hit, we didn't have that.
[21:07:13] <moose> More people have the COVID-19 vaccines worldwide than any other vaccine at this point.
[21:07:53] <gwozniak> If this was the first strain, things would have been a lot worse
[21:08:36] <moose> If we had the vaccine at its current deployed volume on day 0, we wouldn't be suffering a pandemic.
[21:09:03] <moose> It wouldn't have survived. The reproductive rate of these new variants, delta and omicron especially, is extremely high compared to the first variants.
[21:09:50] <moose> Vaccines work, is what I am saying. And I think that it's too early to say if omicron is even less deadly in any population yet.
[21:10:22] <imode> we have reference data from south africa and the UK, though.
[21:11:22] <gwozniak> Ontario science council spokesperson yesterday was saying that the numbers are looking better than delta w.r.t. severe outcomes in anyone who has 2 or more doses
[21:11:40] <Xe> i really hope i don't get hospitalized when i eventually get covid (assuming i haven't gotten it already)
[21:12:05] <gwozniak> But that you have a better chance of seeing mild symptoms than delta when vaccinated
[21:12:21] <defect> i got a breakthrough infection after three rounds of pfizer, and had a sore throat for a day and light cough for two
[21:12:54] <gwozniak> If you're not vaccinated, it may be a very different story
[21:13:14] <bontaq> hopefully not, I got it over christmas (moderna vaxed no boost) and it was just a mild headache / cough / conjestion for two days
[21:13:14] <gwozniak> Unsure on that, based on what the science council was saying
[21:13:52] <imode> I'm gonna keep treating it as deadly.
[21:14:26] <imode> what doesn't kill you fucks you up in other ways.

[21:18:43] <Xe> i'm really glad i have my VR setup so ironed out though
[21:19:16] <Xe> so at least i have an escape, if not a fleeting one
[21:28:47] <kline> do you meen "if a fleeting one"?
[21:29:42] <Xe> kline: idk, having a little break from the fuckfest on the outside is nice
[21:30:01] <Xe> even if it's something like playing a round or two of population one
[21:30:04] <kline> "if not a fleeting one" suggests that youre going to spend an extended amount of time in vr
[21:30:14] <Xe> lol i am
[21:30:19] <kline> o-oh
[21:30:24] <Xe> i have been
[21:30:26] <Xe> i likely will continue to
[21:30:55] <kline> one day someone will make a headset that i can use for more than 10 mins
[21:31:02] <kline> and i will be able to comprehend such things
[21:31:22] <imode> it needs to be glasses-thin for me.
[21:31:25] <Xe> varifocal VR is gonna change a lot
[21:31:30] <imode> glasses-thin and glasses-light.
[21:31:57] <Xe> right now one of the big problems with VR is that it has one fixed focal point
[21:32:20] <Xe> so the horizon and up to about 3 feet away looks fine
[21:32:36] <Xe> but any closer and you subconsciously violate the focus of the headset
[21:33:26] <imode> give me text over complex visuals any day.
[21:33:35] <Xe> I work around it by focusing _behind_ things I want to look at closely in VR, but overall yeah the varifocal VR improvements are going to be astounding
[21:34:02] <Xe> however most of what i play are rhythm games lol

[21:39:10] <kline> never being airsick
[21:39:15] <kline> enjoying rollercoasters, etc
[21:39:23] <kline> VR makes me very nauseous in <15 mins
[21:39:35] <Xe> what game did you start with?
[21:39:46] <imode> damn it is dumping outside.
[21:39:49] <Xe> i usually suggest people start with things like Tetris Effect because there's less movement
[21:39:56] <Xe> helps you get your VR legs
[21:40:17] <kline> i think the steam vr workshop when it was brand new
[21:40:23] <kline> we had a oculus dk1 at uni, we had a very good games course with development consoles etc
[21:40:32] <Xe> yeah, no wonder lol
[21:40:41] <Xe> there's been a lot of improvements since then
[21:40:48] <manicennui> kline: Did you have problems with early 3d games?
[21:40:48] <kline> sure, and ive used a bunch since
[21:40:49] <manicennui> I did.
[21:40:59] <manicennui> I think it is refresh rate.
[21:41:12] <Xe> 120hz is a lot more comfortable for me
[21:41:17] <kline> most recent was an up to date vive with keep talking and nobody explodes
[21:41:26] <Xe> OG vive?
[21:41:32] <Xe> that only tops out at 90hz
[21:41:43] <kline> no idea, it was a friends
[21:41:57] <Xe> was it black with a fabric headstrap?
[21:43:16] <kline> nah, like mad scientist goggles
[21:43:18] <Xe> i've found that the Vive is actually pretty decent to start out with, but the two most comfortable headsets i've used for longer periods of time are the valve index (which is my daily driver) and the oculus quest 2
[21:44:02] <Xe> the index can go up to 144hz (but it is super taxing on my poor GPU), but i usually run it at 120hz
[21:44:10] <kline> ive used the valve and the playstation one as well
[21:44:14] <kline> i do like vr, in principle
[21:44:18] <kline> i just cant really use them
[21:44:23] <Xe> it's very early stage yeah :/
[21:48:32] <gwozniak> I tried VR and it seemed pretty "meh"
[21:48:46] <gwozniak> Had a nice novelty effect.  Then it got tired fast
[21:49:29] <indigo> Same here!! I don’t get the hype
[21:49:33] <gwozniak> I don't see it as an escape to anything either
[21:49:58] <imode> it's too weighty. too much overhead.
[21:50:19] <imode> too much computational overhead to try to fool my monkey brain and fail in the majority of time.
[21:57:06] <kline> tbh
[21:57:22] <kline> my #1 hope is for more hololens style stuff
[21:57:48] <kline> AR overlays/huds are far more interesting to me than games in vr
[21:58:23] <imode> if only the opportunity to be malicious with that concept wasn't a factor.
[22:00:09] <imode> "pay $15/mo to not have ads in your VR space!111!!!"
[22:00:44] <gwozniak> kline: I think AR is more interesting, yes. Still not super-excited about it, but I'd be more inclined to use it than VR
[22:02:38] <Xe> gwozniak: i mean i'm fully accepting of the fact that i am weird, but the fact that i live my life kinda permanently dissociated as is makes it really easy for me to immerse in VR environments. this is all really early stage though, this generation of stuff is going to be looked back on as some kind of random flailing about as people try to figure out what the fuck they are doing lol
[22:04:10] <companion_cube> can't wait to interact with google cloud build in a glorious, laggy, VR interface
[22:04:33] <Xe> yeah that's the other really annoying thing about a lot of VR interfaces as-is
[22:14:48] <manicennui> I think VR will be like Kinect and the Wii Remote. There will be a few cases where it is not bad, but it will mostly die off.

[22:16:14] <manicennui> The idea that VR will be used for business meetings and such is as laughable as the previous attempts to sell technology that doesn't solve a real problem to businesses.
[22:16:48] <gwozniak> This is the one that boggles my mind
[22:17:15] <gwozniak> Having a meeting can be bad enough.  One in VR land?  Why the fuck would I do that
[22:17:21] <gwozniak> It only adds to the problems
[22:17:33] <manicennui> gwozniak: So you can see Zuck in his full robot glory.
[22:17:59] <gwozniak> of course! how could I be so silly
[22:18:08] <manicennui> Yeah, the main problem with video meetings is video/audio quality issues.
[22:18:14] <ngoldbaum> a metaverse meeting like that will be worth it once VR doesn’t involve strapping a couple pounds of screens and microchips to your face
[22:18:28] <ngoldbaum> also losing all situational awareness IRL
[22:18:46] <imode> how about we just don't have meetings. y'all can fuckin' type.
[22:19:38] <gwozniak> tbh most meetings I have been in in the past 4 years have been pretty useful
[22:19:51] <manicennui> imode: Without meetings, what will half of the staff do all day?
[22:23:35] <ngoldbaum> went to costco right when it opened this morning with an n-95 mask
[22:23:42] <ngoldbaum> hope i didn’t get omicron :/
[22:23:52] <ngoldbaum> been trying to not be indoors in public lately
[22:25:01] <indigo> ngoldbaum: how is compliance with the local mask law where you live
[22:25:52] <ngoldbaum> ok. lots of dicknoses and kids with no masks.
[22:26:05] <bkero> What a bad place.
[22:26:17] <bkero> Costco is full of dicknoses, even in places that should know better
[22:26:35] <ngoldbaum> the cops won’t enforce it if the businesses call them and the businesses don’t want to deal with belligerent asshole
[22:26:58] <ngoldbaum> also most people still wear cloth masks and surgical masks which aren’t all that effective
[22:26:58] * manicennui can't imagine how bad it is at Walmart
[22:27:33] <manicennui> My doctor's office makes everyone switch to a surgical mask when they arrive.
[22:27:36] <gwozniak> ngoldbaum: we are still using cloth/surgical masks here, only because we haven't found any N95s yet
[22:27:38] <ngoldbaum> i like these n-95s i got, they seal a lot better than the kn-95s i’ve been using
[22:28:03] <ngoldbaum> gwozniak: plenty if places to get them online at ~$2/mask
[22:28:22] <bkero> I got a 30 pack for putting in a newegg order lol
[22:28:24] <bkero> for free
[22:28:48] <ngoldbaum> kn-95s are like $1/mask
[22:28:54] <ngoldbaum> i understand they’re kinda expensive
[22:29:05] <ngoldbaum> but worth it for me for a little peace of mind :/
[22:29:48] <bkero> kn95 filter material is only at peak efficiency for 8 hours
[22:30:33] <gwozniak> I suspect N95s will not become the norm around here
[22:30:57] <riv> "Blah blah blah tracking cookies click OK to continue" plastered over your face forever
[22:31:20] <bkero> N95 masks require a fit test
[22:31:28] <bkero> Nobody's going to do that
[22:31:53] <bkero> How is a KN95 different from an N95?
[22:31:54] <bkero> The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) does not consider a KN95 mask a negative-pressure respirator since it has not been certified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Therefore, OSHA does not require a person be “fit tested” to wear a KN95. Since a person is not fit tested for a KN95, they should not use a KN95 in situations where a fit-tested
[22:31:56] <bkero> N95 mask is required (for example, in clinical areas or for certain medical procedures).
[22:32:14] <bkero> Hopefully they're the norm in hospitals

[22:44:08] <manicennui> Appealing to authority is a favorite argument technique of many people. Extra bonus if the authority is dead, or never existed, and you can speak for them.
[22:44:19] <ngoldbaum> bkero: at least for these specific masks the materials are better and the fit is better for me, also n-95s require straps that go around your head which also gives a better seal than ear loops
[22:44:56] <manicennui> I wonder how many Evangelicals even know who Martin Luther is.
[22:45:19] <manicennui> I'd love to use, "Well, Martin Luther said <made up bullshit that supports my position>".
[22:45:47] <indigo> I recently bought some N95 Auras
[22:46:10] <indigo> They smell like ass but the fit is a lot better than the KN95s

[22:48:08] <riv> Well, Martin Luther said All men ... are NOT created equal! Some are born swifter afoot, some with greater beauty, some are born into poverty and others born sick and feeble. Both in birth and upbringing, in sheer scope of ability every human is inherently different; Yes that is why people discriminate against one another, which is why there is struggle, competition and the unfaltering march

[22:48:32] <manicennui> imode: Totally worth it so you can view a couple news articles and some cat photos.
[22:49:29] <imode> infuriating.

[22:52:49] <imode> they'd kill me before I'd complete the mission.
[22:54:42] <manicennui> I wonder what would happen if all AWS datacenters went down for a month.
[22:56:41] <gwozniak> there would surely be some choas at the business level
[22:57:22] <gwozniak> I will admit that I would like to see what would happen
[22:57:50] <manicennui> I want to see the aftermath of a worldwide EMP
[22:58:10] <indigo> Probably lots of looting!!!
[22:58:47] <manicennui> I'm guessing that millions would die within a day.
[22:59:28] <manicennui> Some military equipment might survive I suppose.
[22:59:56] <Xe> the worst case is if something like that set off dead hand
[23:00:08] <manicennui> Dead hand?
[23:00:42] <Xe> the USSR's failsafe that allows them to have nuclear second-strike capabilities
[23:02:00] <imode> there's no way they wouldn't plan for that, right?

[23:16:29] <imode> I'd rather have the $4k available.
[23:16:31] <manicennui> 10% in less than a year is very good.
[23:16:42] <imode> I agree.
[23:17:04] <manicennui> Not as good as the 25% I made on COST last year though.

[23:28:39] <bkero> Pacific Yurts from down near Eugene.
[23:28:45] <bkero> 30 foot yurt for $15k
[23:29:04] <bkero> $60k for a few acres
[23:29:44] <bkero> $5k in making a platform, $3k in clearing the land, and $10k in battery/solar/inverter/generator and $3k in rainwater catchment, heater, and pump
[23:31:10] <imode> don't clear too much.
[23:31:14] <imode> forest is nice.
[23:31:49] <bkero> No fruit trees will be harmed in this process
[23:32:12] <imode> trees are useful for more than just fruit. :P
[23:32:25] <imode> shade, live root systems holding stuff together.

[23:32:42] <imode> carbon sinks.
[23:32:56] <bkero> Yep
[23:32:57] <manicennui> Homes for animals.
[23:33:12] <bkero> Wind protection is going to be important since apparently this part of the island gets the brunt of hurricanes
[23:33:31] <bkero> I'm just dozing a driveway and a plot for 2 yurts. The rest is staying.
[23:33:51] <imode> I'd forego the driveway for a simple forest path out to a local road.
[23:33:55] <imode> if you can swing it.
[23:33:57] <manicennui> How is there land in Hawaii for $20k per acre?
[23:34:44] <imode> if I didn't have responsibilities I'd be over in europe.
[23:35:25] <bkero> manicennui: lava zones
[23:35:42] <bkero> I'll be paying $30 to $60k per acres to have it in a safer place
[23:35:44] <bkero> and maybe with powerlines
[23:39:42] <manicennui> Hawaii is not as expensive as I expected it to be.
[23:40:50] <bkero> You pay for it in everything else
[23:41:19] <manicennui> This might be the year that I finally seriously look for something.
[23:41:35] <manicennui> Pandemic needs to settle down again so I can go visit a couple places.
[23:43:18] <manicennui> If I buy land, I'll probably look for 2-5 acres in the $75-150k range.
[23:47:08] <bontaq> there's always alaska for the discerning post societal citizen
[23:49:00] <manicennui> I just want a bit of space away from people.
[23:49:05] <manicennui> Not hard mode survival.
[23:49:37] <bkero> You can come buy a plot on the big island for that :)
[23:56:03] <imode> contemplating graph computing.
[23:56:13] <manicennui> I don't want to live in Hawaii.
[23:58:03] <manicennui> It finally got cold here.
[23:58:32] <manicennui> And there is a bit of snow on the ground.
