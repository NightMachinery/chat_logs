[01:14:53] <lmat> Is there any atomicity in the linux filesystem? For instance, if a compiler is reading a code file and I write to it, could the compiler get an "old" first half and a "new" second half?

It could also complain of SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL or simply "Could not resolve what.ever.com" even though "nslookup what.ever.com" resolves just fine.

[05:23:59] <jtritz> looking for a little advice on switching from fluxbox to openbox, high level to start, i don't want to loose functionality iwth my computer in the switch, but it will prob take a while to learn open box and get convereted over to it

[05:24:50] <thrice> well, which functionality are you worried about?  All system-level stuff will carry over
[05:24:56] <jtritz> in my small attempt earlier today, i removed the line exec startfluxbox from xinitrc and that caused a boot problem
[05:25:13] <thrice> no, that wouldn't have affected boot at all
[05:26:00] <jtritz> thrice: well, login then, the login no longer worked
[05:26:24] *** Quits: Pseudocrat (~sudo@user/pseudocrat) (Client Quit)
[05:26:26] <thrice> that also won't affect your ability to login :)
[05:26:33] <demonicm1niac> if you dont exec abythin else then nothing happens on starx yes
[05:26:39] <jtritz> normally, login brings up fluxbox, but i figured removing that line would still bring me to a cmd prompt, as in when i log in as root
[05:26:45] <randomxusr> Is it possible to get Linux to Boot with boot/esp on the same partition and Dm-crypt on second partition with BTRFS? That's my setup, and it mostly works except for remouting root and kernel error

[05:28:08] <jtritz> thrice: i think so, i just have, so basically X must have been trying to start w/o any window manager, or something like that, maybe?
[05:28:32] <demonicm1niac> depends how his autostart looks and if he has anything else in xinitrc that would give a black screen and x not failing to start
[05:28:33] <jtritz> thrice: it prob did, but in any event, my memory fails on the specifics, but it routed be back to login again
[05:28:45] *** kevr is now known as GaKu666
[05:29:00] <demonicm1niac> so X simply quit and was done

[15:16:07] <krux02> it lists tha start jobs, the list messige is about CUPS AFIK, and then nothing happens anymore.
[15:16:27] <krux02> the only thing that I can still do is to press the power button and then the computer shuts down.
[15:16:30] <Namarrgon> can you switch to the next vt?
[15:16:40] <krux02> I don't know if I can enter a console or anything

[15:21:25] <Namarrgon> edit the kernel parameters from the bootloader menu
[15:22:18] <krux02> yea, would be nice if I knew how to do that. I installed the computer a long time ago, I tried to optimize the bootup time, so there is no grub visible.
[15:22:30] <Namarrgon> congratulations

[22:03:30] *** Joins: Szadek (~Szadek@193.27.14.85)
[22:03:33] <thrice> jtritz: well, in that case, you should be able to stop X from auto-starting by commenting out the line in bashrc.  To grawity's point, just change your xinitrc to start openbox instead, if that's your goal.  Then startx or re-enable your autologin
[22:03:45] *** Joins: Blackpajamas (~Blackpaja@67.69.69.78)
[22:03:46] <zx2c4> Wintun is www.wintun.net . Wrote it for wireguard but intended it always to be generic
[22:03:47] <jtritz> so startx, makes sense, i think, i run it from the cmd line instead of running it from my bash_profile, but how do i stopx? or what do i do when i want to exit fluxbox (which starts automatically via the line 'exec fluxbox' at the end of xinitrc)
[22:04:02] <thrice> disclaimer, though, fluxbox doesn't do anything with the graphics system that openbox won't do
[22:04:04] <lantech19446> you wrote it zx2c4 ?
[22:04:14] <grawity> jtritz: startx runs Xorg and ~/.xinitrc side-by-side
[22:04:32] <thrice> exiting fluxbox will stop X automatically
[22:04:35] <grawity> jtritz: if the ~/.xinitrc script finishes (e.g. your 'exec'd program exits), startx kills Xorg automatically
[22:04:56] <lantech19446> thanks for the help grawity guess it's back to the drawing board, may just have to try a different service but PIA was one of the easier ones to get installed
[22:05:04] <grawity> jtritz: or the other way around, if Xorg exits (e.g. via the ctrl-alt-backspace hotkey), all X-based programs exit automatically

[23:21:12] <Namarrgon> you really should know that when you're relying on dkms
[23:22:41] <jonathon> Should tmpfiles.d be able to apply a setting to sysfs? https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AMDGPU#Manual_(default) -> `echo 50000000 > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/hwmon/hwmon0/power1_cap` . Added a config file and it stayed at the default on boot... :/

[23:23:12] <krux02> Namarrgon, the problem is, I am mostly a user of Linux, not an export or anything, and the only reason I have dkms is because somebody recommended it to me the last time I had problems with that driver.
[23:23:38] <Namarrgon> krux02: in that case you should consider a distro that doesn't require you to know how everything works

[23:24:40] <krux02> Namarrgon, generally I like everything in arch, it simply is the best distro, I just don't enjoy the installation process where I have to do everything step by step, but I heared there is an installer now, and there are nvidia gpu problems.
[23:24:43] <MrElendig> krux02: nvidia is generally less headache than amd
[23:24:58] <krux02> btw I also have a desktop computer with manjaro, the gpu drivers have the exact same problem there.
