[04:27:49] <epony> "In Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism (1917), Lenin outlined the five features of capitalist development that lead to imperialism: 
[04:27:49] <epony> 1. Concentration of production and capital leading to the dominance of national and multinational monopolies and cartels.
[04:27:49] <epony> 2. Industrial capital as the dominant form of capital has been replaced by finance capital, with the industrial capitalists increasingly reliant on capital provided by monopolistic financial institutions. "Again and again, the final word in the development of banking is monopoly".
[04:27:50] <epony> 3. The export of the aforementioned finance capital is emphasized over the export of goods.
[04:27:52] <epony> 4. The economic division of the world by multinational cartels.

[05:04:43] <epony> "mind your own business"
[05:08:00] <waleee> so easy for Putin to do. Literally a shit-ton of empty land to play with. Within the current borders.
[05:08:20] <epony> Q: In February 2021, President Joe Biden said that China is the "most serious competitor" that poses challenges on the "prosperity, security, and democratic values" of the U.S.[85] Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated that previous optimistic approaches to China were flawed, and that China poses "the most significant challenge of any nation-state in the world to the United States".
[05:08:35] <gilberth> moon-child: There was a war in Ukraine all the time. And I was too optimistic.
[05:09:09] <epony> Q: Blinken also agreed that Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, "was right in taking a tougher approach to China". In April 2021, the U.S. Senate introduced major legislation in response to China's growing clout in international affairs. The bill, titled "Strategic Competition Act of 2021", reflects hardline attitude of both congressional Democrats and Republicans, and sets out to counter the Chinese government's diplomatic and strategic initiatives.

[05:11:06] <waleee> or realize there's a loads of chinese encroaching on the Russian far east
[05:11:09] <epony> and since you mention Tatarstan, Turkey is a target too
[05:12:00] <waleee> where are russians going for some sun if not Turkey then?
[05:12:32] <epony> remember the Crimean wars?
[05:12:55] <epony> that's the interests of Turkey that NATO is protecting and using to invade Ukraine

[05:17:29] <epony> Russia and China made an agreement before the Olympic games, USA stood at home and issued dispatches to Ukraine.

[05:17:44] <epony> dude, you're stupid

[05:23:36] <aeth> Actually, whether or not I'm Ukrainian is arguable. Americans seem to identify with their ethnicity of ancestry, but when my paternal ancestors left Hungary, they were called Ruthenians.
[05:23:57] <epony> yeah, you're not.. trust me
[05:24:10] <aeth> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rusyns
[05:24:32] <epony> you're not
[05:24:51] <aeth> My paternal ancestors were from the border regions, now mostly in Ukraine, but directly my ancestral village is in northeast Slovakia.
[05:26:42] <aeth> In Slovakia, they're still considered Rusyn (Ruthenian). In Ukraine, they're considered Ukrainian.
[05:27:17] <epony> so you're Polish.. (just joking) what's your view on the situation with the split of Czechia and Slovakia?
[05:27:37] <qhong> epony: bruh current chinese gov is just clown on international stage, they can barely handle internal affairs
[05:27:52] <aeth> It's not my business to really dispute Slovak politics, but Slovakia was probably better off as part of Czechia than independent. Independent, it's a very minor country.
[05:28:02] <aeth> I mean, in a union with Czechia
[05:28:30] * hayley contemplates how much a supercapacitor that has enough charge for SAVE-CACHES-AND-DIE would cost.
[05:28:55] <epony> aeth, and on the Ukrainin crisis?
[05:29:04] <aeth> Anyway, to Slovakia, I'm Rusyn. To Ukraine or Poland, I'm Ukrainian. To Putin, I'm apparently Russian because separate East Slavic ethnicities are apparently a communist fabrication.

[05:31:32] <epony> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kievan_Rus#Foreign_relations
[05:31:42] <aeth> ck_: There's not really anything I can do about Eastern European politics.
[05:31:51] <epony> I told you Turkey is a target.
[05:34:26] <waleee> you guys really missed out when you went orthodox. I imagine a lot of this shit would have been over with ages ago if you hadn't modeled yourselves on the Byzantine empire
[05:34:56] <aeth> Actually, the Carpathian region is traditionally Byzantine Catholic, i.e. Eastern Orthodox in ritual but in communion with the Roman Catholics.
[05:35:08] <aeth> It looks like large parts converted to Eastern Orthodoxy and that's now the majority, though
[05:35:22] <waleee> (excuses to some other orthodox peoples)
[05:36:09] <epony> catholicism was never part of Eastern Europe
[05:36:29] <aeth> Confusingly, there is also an Eastern Orthodox schism and there are Russian Orthodox and Ukrainian Orthodox in about even numbers
[05:37:22] <waleee> the issue with Russian orthodoxy and civilization was that it went navel gazing quickly when the byzantines went under 
[05:37:35] <epony> the iron curtain includes religious division and spoken languages division between the latin and slavic lands
[05:38:15] <epony> it's also the separation between imperial fascism and communal socialism
[05:38:31] <aeth> waleee: There was an attempt to mend the great schism during the late Byzantine period, which basically meant capitulation to the Catholics because at that point the Roman Catholics were way more powerful. This was to try to get aid against the Ottomans, mostly. It wasn't very popular, especially in Greece/Thrace.
[05:39:00] <aeth> But the parts that were under Polish/Austrian/etc. control did have large Greek Catholic populations.
[05:39:03] <waleee> aeth: yeah I have read about that
[05:39:04] <aeth> e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_Greek_Catholic_Church
[05:39:12] <aeth> probably the most successful attempt
[05:39:30] <epony> they are Turks, not ottomans, as Russians are not putinians
[05:39:30] <waleee> but if was far too late for the byzantines to save their empire
[05:40:04] <epony> Otto is not an Arabo-Turkish name
[05:40:32] <aeth> waleee: The Ottomans were never more powerful than all of Catholic Europe combined. There was just no political will for all of Catholic Europe to fight the Ottomans in a combined force. And then the Protestant Reformation happened and it became impossible.
[05:40:45] <epony> there is no catholic church in greece and ukraine
[05:40:46] <ck_> aeth: I expected more agency from the grand emperor of lisp tbh
[05:41:32] <epony> catholicism is not very popular in Germany and England either
[05:41:35] <waleee> aeth: at the time the Ottomans were already on both sides of the Bosporus afai(remember)
[05:41:46] <aeth> ck_: not going to joke about Russian politics because I might wind up with mysterious radiation poisining if I do.
[05:41:53] <waleee> epony: the anglican church is esssentially Catholic in all but name
[05:42:03] <waleee> *essentially
[05:42:09] <epony> there is no "ottomans", those are Turks
[05:42:43] <epony> you call protestants catholics now?
[05:43:10] <epony> you know German and Celtic tribes were and still are enemies of the Roman empire
[05:43:13] <waleee> the High Anglican church has all the catholic paraphenalia exvept the pope
[05:43:41] <aeth> waleee: Yes, the Byzantine Empire was never going to be restored, but they could have held a Greek rump state on the European side of the former empire if they had enough military support. They didn't. The Battle of Nicopolis was basically the end of that. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Nicopolis
[05:44:00] <epony> Catholicism is a flawed Judaism, which in turn was flawed into Islamism
[05:44:25] <epony> so catholics and muslims are romulan vs arabistan
[05:44:46] <aeth> waleee: Constantinople itself lasted for another half-century, though.
[05:44:55] <waleee> Star Trek/historical fiction mashup
[05:45:30] <epony> there is no star trek in history, there are long marches
[05:45:35] <waleee> "romulans"
[05:45:49] <epony> romul and remus are roman names
[05:45:59] <waleee> *Romulus
[05:46:08] <waleee> and roman/romans
[05:46:22] <epony> yes, it has nothing to do with Romania
[05:46:27] <waleee> a romulan is an actor with pointy plastic earys
[05:46:27] <epony> which are Dacian tribes
[05:46:29] <waleee> *ears
[05:47:04] <epony> so your theory of catholicism in the Carpathians is.. invalid
[05:48:25] <aeth> TIL that my ancestors in the Carpathians weren't Catholic, they were Romulans.
[05:48:33] <waleee> as a Swede I consider the theory of a seperate russian land invalid. Obviously it belongs to the varangian vikings and their descendants
[05:48:54] <waleee> so ... would you please evacuate speedily
[05:49:46] <aeth> waleee: You'd have to wait in line. I think the Canadians want Russia because the natural borders for Canada are the entire Arctic region.
[05:50:58] <epony> well, Chinese immigration people live in the western parts of Canada and USA, so it's half-Chinese already
[05:52:18] <epony> the eastern parts of CA and US are Arabic and Indopakistanic respectively
[05:55:46] <epony> waleee, first make a choice between catholicism and protestantism, then ask the finns for moral support to bring you back some sanity
[05:58:01] <epony> then see what you're going to do with the spontaneous muslim conversions, since it's this close between latin and arab religious values
[05:58:56] <epony> and ask USA to not invade you yet, but you know you're a military base anyway so have no options

[06:02:19] <epony> this oligarchy does not exist as terminology on the other side of the iron curtain

[06:03:31] <epony> no such thing as "oligarchy", it's not your capitalism like US corporations
[06:04:17] <epony> personification of politics and economics is a mistake only imperial feodalists make

[06:08:47] <waleee> BoJo, master imperialist extraordinaire glorying in his chad-power over Joe Biden 
[06:08:51] <qhong> i thought capitalism is when bourgeois controls the society, and in some society the bourgeois also happens to be government officials conveniently
[06:09:08] <epony> IN and CN combined are 2.8 bln people
[06:09:29] <waleee> and Russia a measly 0.140 bln
[06:10:09] <epony> US+EU+RU combined is 0.95 bln people
[06:11:57] <epony> qhong, capitalism is a stage of feodalism where the workers belong to the feodal and are mostly immigration
[06:12:08] <pl> qhong: capitalism is when having money makes money, and preferably it's all disengaged from actually doing work with it. That at some point you buy the government is just an implementation detaail
[06:12:17] <epony> money is not capital

[06:27:54] <pl> european feudalism (and japanese one, for that matter, though afaik less so) heavily involved very nested chain of landlords (fun fact: Scotland was, in a way, a feudal country till ~2015 or so?)
[06:30:06] <pl> china had semi- or fully professional armies, IIRC, and generally in times of change whoever gained support of the generals got the top seat, while for significant portion of time the resulting state was somewhat unified organizationally

[10:51:57] <gilberth> moon-child: I'd rather steal bits from the exponent.
[10:53:16] * edgar-rft bought some stolen bits in the darknet

[10:54:20] <moon-child> gilberth: sure.  Either way
[10:54:37] <ck_> http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130119143151/tron/images/0/03/Bit_34.png
[10:54:39] <moon-child> I was thinking there are more bits in the mantissa anyway, and leaving more bits in the exponent preserves more dynamic range
[10:56:28] <gilberth> Well, you need to box 75% of the numbers, when you shorten the mantissa. I think we won't need the full dynamic rate in 75% of the cases.
[10:57:25] <gilberth> Either way I don't like the idea.
[10:57:35] <moon-child> do you?  75% of all the numbers that come up in practice?
[10:58:39] <gilberth> Well, 0.3d0 already has an odd mantissa. And I want that when I receive some double float from somewhere else, like from a file or by FFI, I could reproduce the exact same bit pattern.
[10:59:31] <moon-child> my recollection is, numbers are always moved all the way to the left of the mantissa
[10:59:34] <moon-child> so the implicit leading 1 words
[10:59:36] <moon-child> works
[10:59:45] <moon-child> and I want to chop off the rightmost (least significant) two bits
[10:59:52] <moon-child> so 0.3d0 should not need to be boxed
[11:00:26] <gilberth> How will you guess the correct IEEE double float bit pattern then?
[11:00:49] <moon-child> fill the low two bits of mantissa with zeroes?  Doesn't seem particularly hard
[11:01:26] <ck_> that doesn't sound like "the *correct* [...] pattern"
[11:01:32] <gilberth> That's a different number.
[11:02:29] <moon-child> ah, no, you are right

[11:14:55] <moon-child> White_Flame: yes, but it comes up more often than I thought, if you steal bits from the mantissa
[11:15:09] <moon-child> so now I agree it makes more sense to steal bits from the exponent
[11:15:17] <moon-child> but that also complicates (un)boxing, because the exponent is biased
[11:17:20] <gilberth> And the FPU is so nice that when I say add two NaNs, or a NaN and a number, whatever is the first NaN survives. So I could blindly add two words and check the result only to tell, if everything was fine. I could even name the culprit.
[11:18:07] <moon-child> branches are free on superscalars so, eh

[12:15:14] <White_Flame> neither of those 2 ways require eval

[19:33:16] <gilberth> I have a list of patterns to recognize idiomatic code which perhaps were macros initially. Like testing for a register pair for being an atom. There now is e.g. a "JATOM <rp>, <label>" pseudo-instruction. :-)
[19:35:48] <gilberth> Anyhow, mulisp is an interpreter, but when you set a symbol's function the lambda form is somehow compressed into what the manual calls d-code. I want to figure out how that works.

[20:25:27] <gilberth> Hmm, this asm code is hard to follow. Perhaps I just run it and look at what is in the heap?
[20:26:08] <gilberth> But this looks like some sort of CDR-coding.

[21:59:06] <ck_> hello
[22:08:24] <selwyn> o/
[22:16:54] <gilberth> Yep. The CDR-coding works like this (defun car (x) (logand -2 (core x))) (defun cdr (x) (unless (logbitp 0 (core x)) (+ x 1)))
[22:17:39] <ck_> I saw liveuamap.com on a newsfeed. war livemaps are weird
[22:17:58] <gilberth> This is strange because you find the end marker bit in the CAR of some other cons which may belong to some unrelated s-expression.

[22:24:27] <gilberth> Nah, I haven't got that right (defun cdr (x) (unless (logbitp (core (+ x 2)) (+ x 2)))
[22:26:07] <gilberth> That is it peeks at where the cadr is supposed to be, checks the bit to see that there isn't a cdr anymore. And the word checked could be part of the "d-code" of another function. Took me a while to figure that out.

[23:01:36] <aeth> This Russo-Ukraine situation is really starting to feel like a Czechoslovakia or Austria situation. Note that Austria at the time of the Anschluss was also fascist (just a different kind of fascist) so this observation doesn't imply an endorsement of Ukraine's current government. Two wrongs don't make a right and NATO expansion (which will only accelerate now) doesn't justify annexing a large part (or all) 
[23:01:42] <aeth> of Ukraine if that's what Putin is going to do.
[23:02:34] <shka> https://old.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/sy79g2/macie_wy_rozum_i_godno%C5%9Bci_cz%C5%82owieka/
[23:02:35] -ixelp- Macie wy rozum i godności człowieka? : russia
[23:02:57] <shka> aeth: Fascist-Light!
[23:02:59] <aeth> Yesterday, Putin blamed the existence of Ukraine on communism and it looks like there's a good chance he's going to go full fash and invade all of Ukraine this week.
[23:03:29] <aeth> Meanwhile, a huge portion of the online left wing seems to think that the Cold War's still on and that opposition to NATO means that the opponent is automatically good.
[23:03:44] <shka> hard to say what Putin really has in mind
[23:04:19] <shka> realistically, Ukrainians will never stay by Russia by they own volition
[23:04:31] <shka> actions of Russia made sure of that
[23:04:54] <masinter> why eat the cake all at once, when you can have a slice a day for a week
[23:04:59] <aeth> His Ukraine speech yesterday was fascistic. If he invades and occupies all of Ukraine, he will have de facto gone fascist. This kind of ethnicity-justified expansionism is exactly what the Fascists of the 20th century did.
[23:05:51] <shka> also, Russians are not huge fans of intervention in the Ukraine
[23:06:08] <masinter> Ukrane = cake
[23:06:16] <shka> or, well, letting Russian soldiers die
[23:07:06] <shka> Russians are actually terrified by a prospect of war
[23:07:52] <masinter> i imagine opinions are mixed
[23:08:42] <White_Flame> aeth: the left always goes self-hate, the right always goes other-hate, seems compatible, why can't they just get along? \:)/
[23:08:55] <shka> also, many Ukrainians and Russians were friends before all of this shit took place
[23:08:58] <masinter> weaponized targeted messaging is effective opinion control
[23:09:49] <shka> so all i am saying, I am not sure how much Putin really is willing to sacrifice here 
[23:10:22] <masinter> l'etat c'est moi
[23:12:11] <masinter> i imagine it is a group decision, weighing pros and cons
[23:14:23] <aeth> shka: he's 69, he might be willing to risk everything because opportunities like this don't come often
[23:14:36] <shka> nie
[23:14:39] <shka> *nice
[23:21:47] <selwyn> i think recognising the republics is a sign that russia regards minsk as off the table, at least for now
[23:21:52] <selwyn> not much beyond that
[23:25:01] <selwyn> aeth: in order to occupy an entire country at great cost, you need to motivate your population to accept losses
[23:25:38] <selwyn> much of the russian attitude towards ukraine proper seems to be 'why would we want to look after the basketcase'
[23:25:45] <selwyn> one can see their point
[23:26:28] <shka> selwyn: minsk is the capital of Belarus, not Ukraine
[23:26:29] <selwyn> as shka says intervention wouldn't be popular anyway
[23:26:41] <selwyn> shka: i mean the minsk protocols to end the conflict
[23:27:03] <shka> well, Ukrainians never really wanted to go with it
[23:27:15] <selwyn> well, no
[23:27:26] <selwyn> but lots of people were signed up to it
[23:27:31] <selwyn> and now it is particularly dead
[23:28:10] <shka> i mean, it seemed like the popular opinion in the Ukraine was shifting toward the peace 
[23:28:27] <shka> but then this shit happens
[23:30:23] <shka> the funniest thing is that if not for Crimea and Eastern Ukraine,  there is a decent change that a democratically elected, pro-Russia president would be in power today 
[23:45:45] <shka> actions of Putin really galvanized Ukrainians

[23:46:37] <selwyn> it doesn't seem that united
[23:46:52] <shka> check election results
[23:46:52] <selwyn> apparently in odessa they say 'neither kiev or putin'
[23:47:06] <aeth> me, me, me, pick me
[23:47:12] <selwyn> i am not really in a position to judge though
[23:47:44] <shka> being pro-Russia is now political suicide in Ukraine
[23:48:18] <aeth> Crimea is rightfully Roman. https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Roman_Empire_Trajan_117AD.png
[23:48:19] -ixelp- File:Roman Empire Trajan 117AD.png - Wikimedia Commons
[23:48:44] <selwyn> iirc the byzantine empire's last possession was in crimea
[23:49:39] <aeth> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Trebizond
[23:50:03] <aeth> 1461, not 1453 like Constantinople. But that was a rival post-Fourth-Crusade state.

[23:51:07] <aeth> The final Roman state
[23:51:07] <selwyn> they still speak greek in the region
[23:51:20] <selwyn> of a dialect which preserves many archaic features
[23:51:26] <aeth> You are absolutely right, then. Crimea is sooooooooo Roman
[23:51:33] <aeth> what's Russia doing in Roman territory
[23:52:29] <shka> aeth: be quiet, Putin may now claim himself to be the Roman Emperor of the new Byzantine Empire
[23:52:48] <aeth> tsars already did it
[23:52:55] <aeth> all they had was Crimea, though
[23:52:55] <shka> i know
[23:53:03] <aeth> so weird to have a "Roman Empire" with no Roman territory
[23:53:09] <aeth> At least the Roman Empire was in parts of the Holy Roman Empire
[23:53:23] <masinter> Romania
[23:53:30] <shka> shut up about that
[23:53:41] <shka> who know what this guy is thinking anyway xD
[23:53:50] <aeth> masinter: oh, true, they did take part of Romania (present day Moldova)
[23:53:51] <selwyn> the russian empire got close to having istanbul
[23:54:03] <selwyn> i don't think there are many plausible timelines where they succeeded though
[23:54:10] <masinter> 'hving' is so imprecise
[23:54:17] <aeth> masinter: so two tiny slivers of the Roman periphery were Russian imperial
[23:54:22] <masinter> that was the problem with expert systems
[23:54:30] <aeth> The Holy Roman Empire had more Roman parts. Even most of Italy at one point
[23:55:08] <selwyn> it would be very funny if putin turns out to eschew all personal internet usage
[23:55:14] <selwyn> apart from lurking irc channels
[23:55:22] <masinter> knowledge bases, knowledge graphs -- nothing really is the granularity that you need to reason. Lisp-based AI just led to lots of failures
[23:55:28] <aeth> selwyn: At 69, Putin's old enough to use IRC
[23:55:43] <aeth> selwyn: IRC was even invented in Russia.
[23:55:52] <selwyn> really
[23:56:09] <aeth> Yes, a northwestern Russian province known as Finland.
[23:56:18] <selwyn> lol
[23:56:20] <aeth> Putin will probably want it back at some point after Ukraine
[23:56:27] <shka> masinter: nah, the issue with expert systems is different
[23:56:43] <masinter> chigaimasu
[23:56:56] <shka> you want to make Fins angry i guess
[23:57:09] <masinter> there isn't one issue
[23:57:38] <shka> but yeah, they never bothered to abolish the monument of Peter The Great in their capital
[23:57:53] <masinter> Feigenbaum had a perspective
