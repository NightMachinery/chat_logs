[00:53:50] <shimbles> (percentage)
[00:54:11] <shimbles> could be in any order
[00:54:44] <shimbles> i came up with this idea while writing a PRNG. "on average" a number will have the same number of each digit; so how many of those are there
[00:55:15] <bildramer> think this way: whatever percentage it is for 0 to 10^n, when you add larger integers, it gets lower
[00:56:11] *** Joins: stipa (~stipa@user/stipa)
[00:57:34] <bildramer> perhaps in ternary: 6 out of 27 3-digit base-3 integers (btw you need some defined way to handle leading zeros) have equal number of 0,1,2. now to find the number of 6-digit integers, just add 3 more digits, which also need to be balanced, so you get 6/27*6/27
[00:57:56] <bildramer> so, for all integers it's 0
[00:58:33] <shimbles> the only way it could be 0, is with limit-based reasoning, which is disallowed
[00:58:51] <shimbles> it is clearly larger than 0, since we can use random.shuffle to create boatloads of them
[00:59:37] <bildramer> too bad there are infinite integers
[01:00:07] <shimbles> it is plain to see that no matter how large your integer is, there are larger integers with an equal number of each digit
[01:00:31] <bildramer> or maybe you can say "percentage of the integers" is undefined, but then "50% a random integer is even" feels true, not undefined
[01:00:39] <bildramer> yes
[01:00:52] <bildramer> that's also true for primes, and you also have a 0% chance of picking a prime

[05:03:17] <rex> Let S be convex and s',s'' ∈ S. Is it true that inf_{s ∈ S} (1-λ)||s - s'|| + λ||s'' -s|| = 0
[05:03:36] *** Joins: brownorange (~brownoran@191.96.67.50)
[05:04:17] <johnkeats6> i don't think so. it's a sum of positive things so each inf would need to be 0
[05:04:51] <johnkeats6> i mean, "at the same time"
[05:05:27] <johnkeats6> my money's on "if and only if s' = s'' "

[05:46:49] <brownorange> i think i found a way to prove soundness without some fancy language
[05:47:01] <brownorange> for prop-calc
[05:47:18] <brownorange> Given L, then L<->True.   Given A, then A<->True.   Thus given L, then L->A, and L<->True, and !(True->False), so A must be True.  Proof of soundness condition 1.
[05:47:35] <brownorange> Instance the previous proof such that A becomes (B->A). Proof of soundness condition 2.
[05:49:43] <brownorange> [The Soundness Theorem for L] If |- A in L, then A is a tautology. Also, if G 1 , G 2 , ..., G n |- A in L, then (G 1 ∧ G 2 ∧ ... ∧ G n ) -> A is a tautology.

[13:47:44] <int-e> kmh: In theory, an NP oracle will tell you whether an NP problem has a solution or not, so it solves the decision problem.

[13:51:14] <int-e> kmh: Formally, NP is just treated as a set (say, of SAT instances encoded as natural numbers) and the oracle is a membership test for that set, which for purposes of complexity is assumed to take constant time. So P^NP is like P with an extra operation.

[13:54:11] <int-e> Since it's just a set, we can discuss things like P^HP -- decision problems that can be solved in polynomial time if we could solve the halting problem... something we have no hope of doing in practice. And in this context, the idea of invoking a mythical, all-knowing being makes a lot of sense.
[13:55:33] <int-e> kmh: Btw, crucially, an NP oracle does more than guessing: If an NP instance has no solution, it will tell you so without fail.
[13:55:53] <munkis> thanks. I was wondering if the completeness of the graph made a difference but apparently not.
[13:56:30] <int-e> munkis: you can encode absent edges as having weight 2 and present edges as having weight 1, and then ask whether there's a Hamiltonian path of length n.
[13:56:38] <int-e> (n being the number of vertices)
[13:57:12] <int-e> So that's a reduction from the Hamiltonian path problem to the optimization problem (which will give you a path of length n if there is one).
[13:57:29] *** Quits: chomwitt (~Pitsikoko@athedsl-16082.home.otenet.gr) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[13:57:47] <munkis> right so the fact that the presence of a hamiltonian path on non-complete graphs being np-har proves that the optimization problem is as hard on a complete graph.

[14:12:01] <Fangs> wouldn't that be lovely

[14:13:52] <Fangs> which can be thought of as an S^1 principal bundle.. so there's some spectral sequence nonsense with one of the terms being K(Z,2).. which is *supposedly* really complicated? so its *apparently* expected that PU(n) is complicated too (I mean you look at that screenshot and it is)

[14:20:11] <int-e> Fangs: but I see no better use for the observation that if f,g are in the kernel then f*g is also in the kernel, apart from what you're doing: predict that if f,g are in the chosen basis for kernels of dimensions n,m, then f*g is a good basis vector for the kernel  of degree n+m.

[17:09:00] <Fangs> I'm obviously not a phd student but I was told multiple times that most people would be lost unless they regularly talk to the presenterand already know most of the content
[17:10:17] <Z-module> Fangs, though you can have a nonzero ideal that's a subring, even a subfield, with its own multplicative identity != the 1 of the big ring
[17:10:29] <Z-module> (and probably you therefore don't let it qualify as a "subring")
[17:10:56] <Fangs> that's not a subring in my book, I saw that convo you had
[17:11:07] <Fangs> Z-module: think it was nZ/mZ in Z/mZ for some values of n and m
[17:11:21] *** d4 is now known as functor
[17:11:41] <Z-module> well there are easier examples, like Q x {0} as an ideal in Q x Q
[17:11:51] <Fangs> ah ofc
[17:13:43] <Fangs> rings are gross
[17:14:43] <Z-module> heh, yeah, but such a fascinating grossness
[17:15:35] <rubiksdream> i dont think they're that gross, in this example Q x {0} isnt really a subring of QxQ at all, because were interpreting each element differently
[17:15:36] <Z-module> rngs too
[17:16:07] <Z-module> it's a subring if you don't require the same 1 in both
[17:16:47] <Fangs> that's a subring if your definition is "a subset that is a ring"
[17:17:30] <Z-module> yeah
[17:17:33] <rubiksdream> hm, i guess so, you're changing a lot of the properties of the elements though, for example Qx {0} is now a field, so each element is a unit
[17:17:47] <Z-module> it's a "pointed field", heh
[17:18:16] <Fangs> I never understood this whole f(1) = 1 thing with fields and rings
[17:18:26] <Fangs> you never require f(e) = e for groups
[17:18:27] <rubiksdream> as in why you need it?
[17:18:31] <Z-module> anyway, as you know, my actual favorite example of this phenomenon is the "subfield" {[0],[2],[4],[6],[8]} of Z/10Z, having identity element [6]
[17:18:49] <Fangs> 2Z/10Z
[17:19:08] <rubiksdream> so just Z / 5Z then
[17:19:22] <Fangs> its neat that 2 is not a unit there
[17:19:31] <int-e> Fangs: Only because you don't have to require f(e) = e for groups.
[17:20:01] <Fangs> int-e: exactly, so adding it to your axioms is 'cheating'
[17:20:36] <rubiksdream> is it true that if kZ/nZ is such that n = kp, for p a prime, that kZ/nZ is a "subfield" of Z/nZ, where "subfield" is Z-modules interpretation of that term?
[17:20:41] <int-e> Nah, a homomorphism has to preserve all operations, including nullary ones.
[17:21:06] <Fangs> int-e: thats not obvious until you define them in terms of arrows
[17:21:23] <Fangs> (or something to that effect. "nullary operations" is arrow-ish in flavour)
[17:21:27] <int-e> But for groups you leave f(e) = e out because it's implied by f(ab) = f(a)f(b): f(a) = f(ea) = f(e)f(a), so f(e) = e
[17:21:29] <rubiksdream> its obvious if you think about isomorphisms of structures in first order logic
[17:21:50] <Fangs> I dont think in first order logic, anymore
[17:22:09] <int-e> Fangs: you poor thing, your life is entirely pointless
[17:22:15] <rubiksdream> but more down to earthly, as int-e says, f(e) = e is implied for groups
[17:22:28] <rubiksdream> and you can do a little digging to figure out when f(1) = 1 is implied for rings

[17:23:27] <Fangs> rubiksdream: I dont count that as a good enough reason to add it as axiom for rings
[17:23:33] <Fangs> (infact it doesnt do any justification at all)
[17:23:43] <int-e> rubiksdream: Sure, but in the context of /substructures/ we expect nullary operations to not change their result at all.
[17:24:45] <int-e> (Because we derive substructures by restricting the domain) So {[0],[2],[4],[6],[8]} is not a subring of Z/10Z if your rings have units, despite being a ring where addition and multiplication are the restrictions of those in Z/10Z.
[17:24:56] <Fangs> some justification would be something along those lines of "without it, certain diagram doesnt commute"
[17:25:05] <int-e> Which was the entire point of the example.
[17:25:13] <rubiksdream> that is very true, i think Z-module conceded that it should not be called sub-___
[17:25:14] <Fangs> injecting ring hom wouldn't be able to be lifted with (abritary) ring homs
[17:25:16] <rubiksdream> *int-e
[17:25:50] <rubiksdream> but i guess i concede its sorta interesting that you only lose one nullary operation
[17:25:50] <Z-module> well, I don't have a religious opinion about sub-whatevers. Just that people need to spell out their assumptions at the start of any discussion.
[17:26:28] <Fangs> I've never really heard of people working with rngs
[17:26:32] <int-e> rubiksdream: I'm mainly arguing against the idea that preserving the unit element is not part of the specification of the subgroup.
[17:26:56] <int-e> On a moral level :P
[17:27:16] <Fangs> Lie algebras are dumb too, in that they aren't really rings. they have intepretation in any ring (with the commutators etc) that makes it much easier to 'accept' why we're looking at "non-associative 'rng'"

[19:41:40] <Panther> Saying 'such a powerful' and 'so powerful' really doesn't define what the extent of their power is, and the extent would appear to be up to the point that they are unable to destroy themselves. Which makes sense.. it would have to use up all of its energy to cancel itself, but there wouls have to be some sort of overridding executive direction, which would necessarily be over and above the
