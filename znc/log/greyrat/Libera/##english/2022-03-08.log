[00:24:04] <twb> Bayes: in general words start out "foo bar", then "foo-bar", then "foobar" as the compound becomes increasingly common
[00:24:32] <twb> Bayes: so "is 'geotemporal' written with a hyphen?" depends how common that word is.
[00:24:56] <twb> Bayes: it's also influenced by your house style
[00:25:27] <twb> Personally I would accept "geo-thermal" OR "geothermal", as long as you are consistent.

[09:38:15] <vim_fans> hi,there. can anyone help me with this sentence “...being "rather unique" is no more possible than being rather pregnant.”
[09:39:47] <Maxdamantus> vim_fans: it's implying that either something is unique or not unique and there's nothing inbetween.
[09:42:13] <vim_fans> Maxdamantus: Is there has anything to do with pregnant ?
[09:43:18] <Maxdamantus> vim_fans: it's using pregnancy as an analogy, since someone supposedly can't be "rather pregnant".
[09:44:21] <Maxdamantus> Arguably it doesn't work in either case though, since "rather unique" and "rather pregnant" can both be understood as meaning something.
[09:44:28] *** Quits: ymwm (~yingmanwu@117.26.70.231) (Quit: Leaving)
[09:45:39] <vim_fans> Maxdamantus: I am sorry, I am not an native English speaker, "rather pregnant"？ what does rather mean in this phrase ?
[09:45:54] <Maxdamantus> vim_fans: it basically means "very".
[09:47:13] <vim_fans> you just use unique or don't use it, but you shouldn't use rather unique ? 
[09:48:00] <Maxdamantus> Yes. The speaker doesn't like the phrase "rather unique".
[09:48:49] <Maxdamantus> vim_fans: the statement is implying that both terms "unique" and "pregnant" are binary states, so it's not possible to be a certain degree of either (it's either 0% or 100%, not 50%), but in natural language, you can use modifiers like "rather" and "very" there to refer to something other than the absolute concepts.
[09:48:56] <vim_fans> Maxdamantus: thank you ,very appreciate your time /
[09:49:12] <Maxdamantus> eg, it's quite normal in natural speech to say that someone is "very pregnant".
[09:52:39] <vim_fans> Maxdamantus: very pregnant mean that it's very easy to figure out some woman is pregnant?
[09:52:59] <Maxdamantus> vim_fans: it means they're very far along in the pregnancy.
[09:54:11] <white2> Maxdamantus, very pregnant such as 8 month / 9 months ?
[09:54:53] <Maxdamantus> white2: that is very pregnant, yes.
[09:55:21] <white2> *months. Thank you

[18:26:35] <henk> hi, I’m wondering if the following use of »whether« is correct: »The content will already be outdated after a short time, whether because passwords have been changed, or perhaps created in the meantime but not transferred.« I have never seen it used this way.
[18:28:55] <CuriosTiger> I would use "either" rather than "whether" here.
[18:29:31] <henk> CuriosTiger: yeah, that would sound better to me.
[18:29:42] <CuriosTiger> Also, entirely apart from the grammar, I find the content of the sentence a little clunky. Passwords aren't generally considered "content". Even if they are here, are they talking about passwords or other data being transferred?
[18:30:22] <CuriosTiger> It's also unusual for passwords to be "created". Usually what's created is a user account. But that could be context-dependent.
[18:30:27] <henk> I think I have seen »be that« or »be it« in such constructs. Would that be correct?
[18:31:03] *** Quits: wakeup (~wakeup@user/wakeup) (Quit: Client closed)
[18:31:11] <CuriosTiger> "Be that as it may" is commonly said, and close to a set phrase. I don't often hear "be that" except in that context.
[18:31:34] <CuriosTiger> "be it" is a subjunctive phrase. Whether it would be correct depends on how you use it in the sentence.
[18:31:46] <henk> CuriosTiger: Yes, in this context it makes sense. It’s a blog article from a cloud storage provider that includes a password safe. I’d link to the article but I’m not sure whether that would be considered advertising.
[18:32:16] <henk> CuriosTiger: do you consider the use of »whether« here wrong or just not the best choice?
[18:32:19] <CuriosTiger> "The content will be outdated after a short time, be it due to passwords changing or data being transferred elsewhere." for example.
[18:32:24] *** Joins: casmajavi (~casmajavi@user/casmajavi)
[18:32:41] <CuriosTiger> henk: I consider it very clunky. I'm not sure it's definitively wrong.
[18:33:39] <CuriosTiger> It's not unusual in English to use "whether" to distinguish between two alternatives, but it's more commonly used to decide between actions.
[18:33:48] <CuriosTiger> Ie. I can't decide whether to go to the party or to stay home.
[18:34:12] <henk> CuriosTiger: alright, thank you 
[18:34:16] <CuriosTiger> But I do think the usage in the sentence above is acceptable. It's just not how I would phrase it.

[21:50:25] <Wh0> is it 230 Nos. or 230 NOS or 230 NOS. or 230 Numbers or 230 Number?

[21:50:45] <blkshp> Can you explain... more?
[21:50:49] <Wh0> what is correct ?
[21:50:59] <blkshp> I don't understand what you're trying to say.

[21:51:24] <blkshp> "230 nos / numbers Hazardous chemicals" neither option makes any sense to me.
[21:52:06] <Wh0> then what is right way to indicate quantity in that context?
[21:52:34] <blkshp> So basically you're saying that you worked with 230 different hazardous chemicals?
[21:52:39] <Wh0> yes
[21:52:55] <blkshp> I worked with 230 hazardous chemicals.
[21:53:17] <blkshp> The use of the word "number" (or any shortening of it) is not required.
[21:53:31] <Wh0> great, thanks for clarifying it is like i ate 5 apples.
[21:53:37] <blkshp> Precisely :)
[21:53:55] <Wh0> How many sons: 5 Nos.
[21:54:00] <blkshp> nope
[21:54:05] <Wh0> so nos/number is used in which context?
[21:54:07] <blkshp> How many sons: 5.
[21:54:16] <Wh0> now i am curious to know about it
[21:54:23] *** Quits: great_taste (~great_tas@user/great-taste/x-5798414) (Quit: Client closed)
[21:54:32] <blkshp> The number of chemicals i worked with is 230.
[21:54:41] <blkshp> Number never follows the number.
[21:54:52] <Wh0> i see
[21:55:06] <blkshp> and never "nos"
[21:55:40] <Wh0> "Number never follows the number." is this any kind of grammatical rule? 
[21:55:49] <blkshp> I doubt it
[21:56:38] <Wh0> "Led a 13 member auditing team verifying the proper usage of 230 Hazardous materials & chemicals" is there still any room for improvement?
[21:56:49] <Wh0> to make it more clear/precise/concise this bullet point in my resume
[21:56:51] <blkshp> I led...
[21:57:06] <blkshp> Verifying... are you sure that's the word?
[21:57:46] <blkshp> Wh0: understaod. Now, Was the proper usage already documented and you just proved that was right?
[21:58:06] <Wh0> Led a 13 member auditing team to verify proper usage of 230 Hazardous materials/chemicals in the plant, is it fine?
[21:58:36] <blkshp> Please respond to my prior question in order for me to answer your latest one.
[21:58:57] <blkshp> But i'll be back in 5 minutes, im going out in 15

[21:59:23] <Wh0> i guess verify is a verb so verifying is similar to breaking or running

[22:06:04] <GuiToris> where's my question?
[22:06:14] <blkshp> You're too late, i have 5 minutes.
[22:06:16] <Wh0>  how to relate/link that sentence with ISO 45001 (it is one of the standard followed at works)
[22:06:20] <blkshp> No idea.
[22:06:36] <blkshp> I'm sorry, that's outside my knowledge!
[22:06:37] <Wh0> it becomes yours now GuiToris 
[22:06:49] <blkshp> NEin, er kanst nicht.
[22:06:56] <GuiToris> did you hand blkshp over me?
[22:07:01] <Wh0> "ISO 45001:2018 specifies requirements for an occupational health and safety (OH&S) management system, and gives guidance for its use, to enable organizations to provide safe and healthy workplaces by preventing work-related injury and ill health, as well as by proactively improving its OH&S performance."
[22:07:06] <GuiToris> blkshp, do you know what I was about to ask?
[22:07:11] <blkshp> No
[22:07:17] <blkshp> But did I get that right!?
[22:07:18] <Wh0> copied from google
[22:07:19] <GuiToris> I thought I'd already asked my question, but it's not here
