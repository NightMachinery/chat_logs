[22:08:56] <Reventlov> Hello.
[22:09:23] <Reventlov> I have a small problem with my openvpn client, this is its behaviour : https://0x0.st/-G95.txt
[22:09:51] <Reventlov> it seems IÂ can establish the connection but then nothing answers. Do I need to setup something special from my client, regarding e.g. firewall ? 
[22:27:42] <BtbN> define "nothing answers"
[22:37:44] <rob0> --verb 4 might help
[22:38:48] <rob0> obviously(?) your firewall should allow the traffic you want to allow, but in this case it looks like the tunnel itself is blocked
[22:39:58] <BtbN> When I hear "nothing answers", I think of the VPN server running on some device that's not the router, and then clients trying to reach the server side LAN
[22:40:15] <BtbN> Which does not work without appropiate routing to the VPN server for the VPN network
[22:51:04] <rob0> looks like a keepalive of 60, and nothing ever passes after the connection (TCP it looks like) was established.
[22:51:51] <rob0> which is weird, because a TCP connection necessarily means that packets passed in both directions
[22:57:18] <rob0> strange that a firewall would have a limit on packets in a connection

[23:01:41] <sawgood> Hi OpenVPN:  What if:  you have say 20 or so devices (all using the same .OVPN file) ... back to the server:  but others now have the .OVPN file: and you want the 20 devices to keep working (to hard to change them), but yet you do not want the 21st device or others to work if they get the .OVPN file?
[23:25:38] <rob0> eww
[23:27:48] <rob0> Ideally, use one set of credentials (one TLS certificate) per device, and DO NOT enable --duplicate-cn
[23:28:43] <rob0> I don't know how to set an arbitrary limit other than one connection per certificate.
[23:28:58] <rob0> I suppose you could script something.
[23:47:19] <sawgood> rob0: ah: thank you!
[23:47:41] <sawgood> I'm going to practice that: downloading the Windows client for OpenVPN now
[23:58:16] <rob0> sucky thing without --duplicate-cn and shared credentials: a new connection from the same certificate cuts off the existing one.
[23:58:43] <rob0> but the problem is the sharing of credentials :)
