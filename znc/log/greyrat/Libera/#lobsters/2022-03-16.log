[01:33:57] <iDrougge> Have you used Windows some time? I appreciate that MacOS only makes sounds as a reaction on user input.
[01:34:12] <wink> switching it on is user input ;)

[01:50:22] <JordiGH> Still beeps.
[01:50:42] <iDrougge> Then turn off the alert volume.
[01:51:18] <iDrougge> There are also sound settings in the terminal.
[01:51:33] <JordiGH> What does terminal have to do with Firefox?
[01:51:39] <JordiGH> Does macOS change the meaning of terminal?
[01:51:56] <JordiGH> Is beeping my punishment for not using Safari?
[01:52:04] <iDrougge> You run Bash in Firefox? Sorry, I thought that was in a terminal.
[01:52:45] <JordiGH> I don't run Emacs in a terminal either. Still beeps. Where's the alert volume?
[01:52:59] <iDrougge> Right above the UI sound settings.
[01:53:36] <JordiGH> Aha, found it.
[01:53:43] <JordiGH> No more beep.
[01:54:18] <iDrougge> Both Firefox and Emacs are programs from another platform. Tim Apple can't force them to respect your wishes.
[01:54:34] <JordiGH> Tim Apple created the beep.
[01:54:35] <iDrougge> Or even to respect the operating system.
[01:55:16] <iDrougge> Did he? Did he really write and commit that code to Emacs and Firefox?
[01:55:40] <JordiGH> He created the beep that Emacs and Firefox are playing.
[01:55:42] <JordiGH> Him, personally.
[01:56:02] <JordiGH> He said, "here's a beep. Play it whenever you wanna annoy Jordi in particular. Drive him mad. Make him suffer."
[01:56:07] <JordiGH> That's him. That's Tim Apple.
[01:56:50] <mockturtle> The first RISC-V portable computer is now available [hardware] (eatonphil) https://lobste.rs/s/wnnvzn
[01:56:50] <iDrougge> And then he hid the sound setting in some obscure place like System Preferences → Sound
[01:56:59] <technomancy> JordiGH: you sure it wasn't steve apple?
[01:57:00] <JordiGH> And he called it "alert".
[01:57:10] <iDrougge> I know, JordiGH, I know. Everyone is out to get you.
[01:57:11] <JordiGH> So that I couldn't figure out what to google for.
[01:57:26] <JordiGH> Hell, even "disable alert" on Google tells me to turn *on* screen flash.
[01:57:58] <JordiGH> technomancy: The student has surpassed the master. Steve died and Tim went beyond.
[01:58:33] <JordiGH> And when I tell people "how does I stop beep" everyone said "mute system sounds" and it still beeps.
[01:58:59] <iDrougge> You just wrote that it doesn't.
[01:59:08] <JordiGH> There are two settings.
[01:59:11] <JordiGH> System sounds.
[01:59:13] <JordiGH> And beeps.
[01:59:18] <JordiGH> Disabling system sounds keeps the beeps.

[02:01:11] <JordiGH> drakonis: There's the beep setting and the system sound setting. Nobody seems to realise that there's a separate beep setting.
[02:02:36] <iDrougge> System sound setting? Is that what it says?
[02:02:52] <JordiGH> "Play user interface sound effects"
[02:03:08] <JordiGH> That's a separate setting from the alert volume.
[02:03:20] <JordiGH> Ergo, alerts are not user interface sound effects.
[02:03:26] <iDrougge> Ah, so things like the trash sound when you throw things in the trash. That kind of superfluous sound effects.
[02:03:29] <JordiGH> They are just there for the sheer joy of torturing Jordi.
[02:03:57] <iDrougge> That, on the other hand, seems to be like shooting fish in a barrel.

[02:04:59] <iDrougge> Right above the other setting.
[02:05:06] <fkr> makes sense
[02:05:21] <JordiGH> Does it? Then why wasn't that your first suggestion?
[02:05:30] <JordiGH> Also, what the fuck is so natural about natural scrolling?
[02:05:37] <JordiGH> What kind of nature does Tim Apple live in?
[02:06:24] <fkr> JordiGH: because I didn't associate the sounds you referred to from the browser to 'Alerts' but to 'user interface sound effects'
[02:06:42] <JordiGH> Or from Emacs or from bash?
[02:06:48] <JordiGH> I think other things have beeped too.

[16:11:35] <wink> also as being told by old people they actually are wide awake and then get up in this early hour. I simply go back to sleep. I just can't sleep 8h without meaningfully waking up atm :(

[17:37:48] <demize> Hmm, seems silly of them to recommend using third-party software when git-subtree can do that.
[17:40:06] <demize> `git subtree split -P path -b new-branch-name` and you get a nice new branch with the split.
[17:42:33] <mwt> yeah, if you're on Windows, installing that software will take more steps than the instructions themselves

[20:41:09] <bsandro> about that risc-v computer - I have one of the first clockworkpi models with rpi compute module inside; still waiting for RK3399 module to replace it even though I don't clearly know what do I need that kind of performance for
[20:41:48] <bsandro> whole unconventional and open architecture sounds really appealing but the implementation is quite unhandy (if that is even a word)
[20:42:30] <bsandro> they tried to make that clockworkpi "cyberdeck" to look like old tandy machine but since it is grossly minified the keyboard is borderline unusable
[20:44:14] <bsandro> rest of the stuff is fairly nice - connectivity, batteries (and battery life), even form-factor is not that bad, just too small.
[20:44:57] <bsandro> it uses very common 18650 modules and you can even replace them without power down one by one; system stays alive
