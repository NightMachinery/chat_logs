[01:54:18] <eurogos> i use hangfire (at the moment)
[01:54:29] <Suchiman> eurogos: seems to work (TM), its cron expressions parser is a bit funky though
[01:56:39] <Suchiman> eurogos: it requires the 6 part version of cron expressions (second precision), so far so good if you know that, but it also disallows "* * * * * *", has to be "* * * * * ?" at least, because it gets unhappy if day of week and day of month are both specified by any means other than ?
[01:57:40] <eurogos> my brain needs a few hours of warm up to get my head around cron

[02:36:14] <Sora> vulnerability question
[02:36:37] <Sora> if I have a public function in a controller with weird types, is there a way to execute this function over http?
[02:37:04] <Sora> I don't know the word for "weird types" but non-string non-int etc
[02:37:10] <Sora> such as a class or other object
[02:37:34] <Sora> I might need to patch a lot of my own shit with helper functions in the controller, marking them internal or private fixes the issue, right?
[02:37:56] <pandem> if it's not a controller no one else can call them
[02:38:11] <pandem> you need to mark it as an http endpoint so that it can be called via http
[02:38:35] <pandem> that can be done with [HttpGet] or [Route] for example
[02:38:50] *** Quits: xb0o2 (~xb0o2@user/xb0o2) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[02:38:54] <pandem> but if it's not an endpoint it should probably be private
[02:39:35] <pandem> although if you use the global registration then it can be
[02:40:04] <Nasp> Sora:  Yes it can be executed
[02:40:33] <Sora> you can actually pass a class in over http?
[02:40:59] <Nasp> How do you use MVC now?
[02:41:15] <Sora> with [route]
[02:41:38] <Sora> i remember having an issue similar to this when I had a function with a Bitmap parameter
[02:41:43] <Sora> and because it was public it tried to get registered
[02:41:51] <Sora> and crashed the app with a weird error that took AGES to find
[02:42:17] <Nasp> Anything public can be called
[02:42:55] <Sora> just public?
[02:43:27] <Nasp> protected as well
[02:43:37] <Sora> internal/private are fine?
[02:43:39] *** Joins: Cecen (~Cecen@cpe-172-89-171-109.socal.res.rr.com)
[02:43:40] <Nasp> Just have anything you dont want as private
[02:43:57] <Sora> but how would you pass in a Bitmap over http
[02:44:13] <Sora> it seems the function would get called with a null parameter
[02:44:40] <bomb> so Cecen why do you help Putin?
[02:44:44] <Sora> so yes it could be called but it'd just error out before (in theory) doing anything harmful
[02:45:51] <Cecen> Idk I'll get back to you on that
[02:47:47] <Suchiman> Sora: if in doubt, make the method static, those can't be called directly :P but yeah non public should also prevent it from being called
[02:48:06] <Sora> or move out of controller class
[02:48:50] <Suchiman> yeah
[02:49:20] <pandem> but if you don't use the global endpoint registration there's no issue, right?
[02:49:34] <pandem> cause then you need to use attributes to mark endpoints
[02:54:06] <lz_> depending on the version, python math library behaves differently lol what a POS lang

[03:43:20] <gufi> in other news i'm abandoning the shell of the car i'm working on, buying another and starting over with that one
[03:43:45] <brianonymous> lol wut happened
[03:43:54] <gufi> pulled a frame bolt through the frame
[03:44:01] <brianonymous> oh yeah, fuck that
[03:44:06] <gufi> found more areas where prev owner slapped some bondo over body damage as well
[03:44:27] <gufi> discoverd the entire front section of the car is squewed
[03:44:51] <gufi> i'm fairly certain this car was wrecked pretty good
[03:45:20] <gufi> not gonna turn a wreck into a show car. so i'm stripping every thing i can off of it and throwing it on dollys pushing it out and starting over
[03:45:23] <brianonymous> any signs of frame twist?
[03:45:31] <gufi> yea that front section of the car
[03:45:46] <gufi> i dont think they hit hard... just enough to damage stuff
[03:45:49] <brianonymous> yeah, aint worth it then
[03:46:15] <gufi> then to cover it all up they bondo'd it and rattle canned the entire car
[03:46:52] <gufi> kinda funny, i was thinking about this last night and realized that once i swap the shell... i'm not using a single item from the orig car at all
[03:47:17] <gufi> new motor, new transmission, oh wait... will be using the transfer case... but thats it i think
[03:47:47] <brianonymous> then you def need a perfect frame
[03:48:21] <gufi> i damn  near just sold every thing and was about to drive to nearest place with an RS3 and be done with it

[04:55:04] <JakeSays> i really shouldn't leave these streams running 24/7. they're chewing up my data budget
[04:57:14] <brianonymous> you pay by the gig? are you on cellular?
[04:57:48] <JakeSays> comcast. 1.2TB/mo cap
[04:58:04] <brianonymous> huh, what happens after that?
[04:58:30] <JakeSays> i get one "grace month" and then they start charging
[04:58:43] <JakeSays> fucking scam
[04:59:11] <JakeSays> google fiber is supposed to be coming
[04:59:50] <brianonymous> id hop on that shit like a bunny
[05:00:05] <JakeSays> oh i will be if i'm still here
[05:00:27] <brianonymous> we just switched to youtube premium and youtube tv
[05:00:36] <brianonymous> from hulu live
[05:00:42] <JakeSays> why?
[05:01:01] <brianonymous> hulu live kept having ad injection problems on our samsungs
[05:01:06] <brianonymous> stream failure
[05:01:54] <brianonymous> i was unsure about youtube premium, but i love it now.. youtube tv seems to also have a bit better quality than hulu live dud
[05:01:56] <brianonymous> did
[05:02:41] <JakeSays> so premium and tv aren't the same thing?
[05:02:49] <brianonymous> really the only reason we have any tv packages at all is so my wife can watch HGTV and the ID channel :|
[05:02:59] <JakeSays> LOL
[05:03:06] <brianonymous> yeah,  premium takes out the ads and give you music.
[05:03:13] <JakeSays> ahh
[05:03:21] <brianonymous> from regular youtube vids i mean
[05:03:28] <JakeSays> right
[05:03:36] <brianonymous> i didnt think itd be worth it, but it is.
[05:03:50] <JakeSays> i thought google folded premium in to tv
[05:04:02] <brianonymous> i think that was their youtube red shit
[05:04:15] <brianonymous> that folded into premium
[05:04:32] <JakeSays> i have hulu, netflix, discovery+, hbo max, prime. it's a pain in the ass
[05:04:37] <brianonymous> yeah
[05:11:08] <JakeSays> russia is in serious trouble now - ikea is no longer doing business with them
[05:12:09] <Suchiman> JakeSays: the tanks had always missing parts anyway
[05:12:21] <JakeSays> lol
[05:15:21] <JakeSays> lol russia's credit rating has been cut to 'junk'
[05:15:40] <jonp> and lots of multinationals like BP have pulled out
[05:15:53] <JakeSays> yup
[05:17:45] <JakeSays> i genuinely believe that we're going to end up in this
[05:18:14] <jonp> agreed
[05:18:26] <jonp> the only way that won't happen is if Putin decides to give up and pull back
[05:18:32] <jonp> and i don't see any evidence of that happening
[05:18:37] <JakeSays> yup
[05:19:49] <JakeSays> putin told macron today that he intends on capturing all of ukraine
[05:19:54] <JakeSays> which.. duh
[05:20:33] <jonp> which *maybe* some would find "acceptable"
[05:20:43] <jonp> but at this point, who thinks Putin would stop there?
[05:20:47] <jonp> why would he stop there?
[05:22:06] <JakeSays> he's going to dip his toe in to one of the smaller former eastern block states
[05:22:17] <JakeSays> to test nato's resolve
[05:22:57] <JakeSays> "Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could devastate global grain markets so deeply that it’s likely to be the biggest supply shock in living memory."
[05:23:17] <JakeSays> ukraine produces enough wheat to feed 600 million people
[05:23:19] <jonp> bigger than Covid? we're *still* dealing with supply chain fallout there, and will continue to do so for years.
[05:23:38] <JakeSays> yes, much bigger than covid
[05:23:39] <jonp> and i think the american breadbasket is salivating at a new market
[05:23:41] <jonp> for better or worse
[05:24:01] <JakeSays> america's bread basket isn't what it once was
[05:24:14] <jonp> also, who wants corn?
[05:25:25] <JakeSays> people who can't get wheat
[05:27:09] <JakeSays> brianonymous: looks like the stream went dead
[05:27:47] <chilversc> Ukraine and Russia combined are about 25% of the world's grain supply
[05:28:15] <JakeSays> yup
[05:28:30] <jonp> how much of that is Ukraine vs. Russia?
[05:28:41] <JakeSays> iirc ukraine is most of it
[05:29:00] <jonp> as in "Ukraine is about 20% of the world's grain supply" or something?
[05:29:11] <JakeSays> i think ukraine is the world's largest grain exporter
[05:29:16] <jonp> which would be much more impressive than "Ukraine + Russia is 25%…"
[05:30:34] <chilversc> so from nytimes they're 29% wheat, 19% corn and 80% sunflower oil
[05:31:43] <brianonymous> i heard a rumor russia is attempting to switch to gold again
[05:31:52] <brianonymous> gold back standards
[05:33:45] <JakeSays> https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/17/infographic-russia-ukraine-and-the-global-wheat-supply-interactive
[05:33:55] <JakeSays> apparently russia is the world's largest exporter
[05:34:28] <JakeSays> so putin could really fuck the world by cutting off exports
[05:34:52] <JakeSays> damn. especially for egypt
[05:35:11] <brianonymous> i dont see a path where fuckery at every level doesnt exist
[05:35:20] <JakeSays> yeah
[05:35:44] <brianonymous> at that point, its just finding ways to keep the nukes in the silos

[07:56:53] <ern> ok, so you can burp, but you get a "bonus"
[07:57:02] <ern> it becomes a puke
[07:57:57] <JakeSays> which isn't a burp
[07:58:18] <ern> it's the intent that counts.
[07:58:38] <JakeSays> what intent
[07:58:51] <JakeSays> and it's the science that counts
[08:00:13] <ern> I guess you can still get over pressure in the stomach enticing you to "burp"
[08:00:22] <ern> which will then turn in to puke instead :/
[08:00:38] <brianonymous> given that option, id never burp again

[13:25:53] <jmer> Suchiman: is quartz good?
[13:26:35] <jmer> Our current scheduler is a mess... basically some c# code that is triggered from Windows SCheduled tasks... but not really run, so the scheduled task just returns "all went well" 5 secs after its's tarted even though the job is running for 4 hours.
[13:26:58] <Suchiman> jmer: it works but is a lot more boilerplate than Hangfire, scheduling tasks is much more code than the hangfire oneliner and you gotta implement an IJob vs. just passing a lambda

[13:32:26] <Nasp> I've considered it, because we had issues with some of the existing schedulers being incredible slow
[13:32:45] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Nah just that we have a health check running on the machine that reports if the sites are ready
[13:32:52] <Nasp> And we only report "started" websites

[14:10:18] <jmer> I mean... if you took it literally
[14:10:34] <MatthiasVance> ahh right smor is butter and not the act of putting butter on
[14:15:36] <jmer> MatthiasVance: we have so many contextual usages of words... Smør is butter, Smøre is spreading... but you could also use smøre as slang for bribing someone

[14:32:50] <MatthiasVance> Yes, go
[14:32:53] <dan01> ok

[14:39:57] <dan01> Ok so going back to my stupid IRC project
[14:40:03] <dan01> A room cannot exist outside of a server
[14:40:16] <dan01> So then I guess Room(Server), right?
[14:41:22] <Suchiman> dan01: yeah
[14:41:45] <Suchiman> dan01: and if need be, you can in the constructor do server.Add(this);
[14:42:34] <dan01> Yeah I need to do something like that
[14:42:52] <dan01> Because the server needs to write to the room
[14:43:16] <dan01> I currently have a method on the server that gives you a stream of data
[14:43:45] <dan01> But the problem is that stream will yield messages from all rooms, I think
[14:44:00] <dan01> for I don't think it's wise for the room to itterate over them itself
[14:44:18] <dan01> I have a MessageDispatcher class that does that instead
[14:44:59] <dan01> so I think the MessageDispatcher wraps the server and then I can Have Room <---> MessageDispatcher
[14:45:26] <dan01> But it's a cyclic relationship either way

[15:15:08] <eurogos> so i had an issue yesterday where my process creates a file and then needs to zip it to send it
[15:15:21] <eurogos> and I was getting the file is being used by another process error
[15:16:09] <Suchiman> eurogos: why not create the zip file directly :P
[15:16:44] <eurogos> its a long story which I feel if i go into it, I will end up needing to re architect the whole lot
[15:17:04] <eurogos> essentially, the API creates an sqlite database file for a remote
[15:17:21] <eurogos> and then bundles it for xmit over the wire
[15:18:06] <eurogos> anyway, the file lock issue was not present on windows but now seems to be present in linux - probably just timing
[15:18:28] <Suchiman> eurogos: easy solution, turn off file locking on linux :P xD
[15:18:46] <Suchiman> eurogos: ah but yeah, having sqlite write the database into the zip file directly won't work
[15:19:09] <eurogos> while i was poking around in the debugger, I used fslocks to see that the file was indeed locked by the proecss that created it
[15:20:12] <eurogos> i'm using usings with classes which I think support IDispose
[15:20:56] <eurogos> but for some period of time afterwards this lock is held
[15:21:11] <eurogos> whats the best thing to do here?
[15:21:44] <Suchiman> eurogos: make sure to Dispose it, "some period of time afterwards" sounds like the finalizer cleans it up eventually
[15:22:15] <eurogos> i even threw in a GC.Collect
[15:22:20] <eurogos> :-/
[15:24:30] <eurogos> can I await a garbage collection?

[17:41:43] <bomb> MatthiasVance missile hit the nearby communication tower
[17:41:49] <dan01> Also about level of abstractions
[17:42:06] <dan01> This IRCServer class that can send and receive raw byte data from the server
[17:42:24] <dan01> Is it ok to implement there methods like joinRoom, sendMessage, etc?
[17:42:41] <dan01> Someone told me that should be a different abstraction level
[17:43:05] <bomb> "Ynet's reproter in Kyiv, however, said after visiting the site the memorial was not harmed and no bomb, missile or artillery shell hit the site itself."
[17:43:15] <xb0o2> Are you exposing the sending/receiving raw byte methods?
[17:44:31] <dan01> xb0o2: Yes... I'm exposing sending a String, which the method will convert to raw bytes for you, and on the receive part I expose a Stream where you cand get incoming messages also as String
[17:44:44] <dan01> xb0o2: https://github.com/stoiandan/SweetIRC/blob/main/SweetIRC/Network/IRCServer.swift
[17:44:50] <xb0o2> I would suggest that you're dealing with what should be multiple levels of abstraction, yeah
[17:46:31] <xb0o2> If I was looking at something like `Server { JoinChannel(); QuitChannel(); ChangeNick(); }` etc I would find anything exposed dealing with the actual bytes as a bit odd
[17:46:53] <dan01> True
[17:47:35] <blezz> interesting syntax
[17:47:38] <dan01> Ok, I'll make a CommandManager { JoinServer ...} that will wrap IRCServer and provide a higher level abstraction
[17:47:53] <blezz> what does try without catch do?
[17:48:20] <xb0o2> My first instinct would be a `Server` that has those methods, does any validation or whatever and creates a `Command` that gets passed to something lower level that actually shunts it off over a connection
[17:48:21] <dan01> blezz: the method is marked as throws, so it just throws

[17:49:11] <dan01> xb0o2: Currently if you look at the end of the file, I have some free functions that do that
[17:50:04] <xb0o2> Server.ChangeNick() validates a bunch of stuff, instantiates a ChangeNickCommand, passes the ChangeNickCommand to a ServerConnection. ChangeNickCommand implements ICommand which has a GetBytes or a WriteTo(connection) method or some such.

[17:52:34] <bomb> sysRPL #openscad was quite active last I checked
[17:52:40] <dan01> xb0o2: Thanks, sounds good
[17:52:54] <dan01> So Server has a ServerConnection
[17:53:06] <MatthiasVance> dan01: Yes you are coupling things too tightly
[17:53:14] <MatthiasVance> dan01: If a server represents, well, a server
[17:53:33] <MatthiasVance> Then you shouldn't pass that to a room, but maybe you can pass a stream instead?
[17:53:49] <sysRPL> bomb: have you used openscad much?
[17:54:15] <dan01> MatthiasVance: Yes, I can pass a Stream, I already have a Stream of incoming messages. Problem is how does the Room send a message?
[17:54:34] <dan01> With xb0o2 a Room can Create a sendCommand, ok, but how it send it to the server?
[17:55:35] <MatthiasVance> Why do you need a Room anyway
[17:56:04] <bomb> sysRPL nah, just made a few silly shapes. it's cool for "generative design" kind of stuff
[17:56:34] <dan01> MatthiasVance: Hmm, well to represent the idea of an IRC Channel
[17:56:50] <xb0o2> dan01: Presumably your `Channel` only exists as a result of interacting with the server?
[17:57:04] <xb0o2> Through some JoinChannel method or whatever
[17:57:07] <sysRPL> i've worked a bit with openscad and it's quite limited in so many ways. it's so limiting that i wouldn't even categorize it as an option for solid modeling
[17:57:21] <dan01> xb0o2: Currently Channel/Room is just a dummy struct that has a String chat property, that's all
[17:57:33] <dan01> xb0o2: but yes I should it like that
[17:57:34] <sysRPL> i've been investing some time into learnign solidworks, but it's bugging the hell out of me
[17:57:50] <bomb> limited indeed. even FreeCAD is more feature rich IMHO
[17:57:52] <xb0o2> Either give it a reference back to the `Server` or whatever `Connection` backs the `Server`, depending on your preference?
[17:58:17] <dan01> xb0o2: Server { joinChannel(name) -> returns a Channel}
[17:59:07] <dan01> xb0o2: Sure, but then as MatthiasVance said, will not be too tightly  coupled?
[18:00:14] <MatthiasVance> dan01: Fix the problem first
[18:00:17] <MatthiasVance> Make it pretty later
[18:00:26] <dan01> Ok
[18:00:46] <xb0o2> Depend on a reasonable interface :)
[18:00:52] <dan01> So then the Channel has a reference to the server in order to send messages
[18:01:14] <dan01> And then the server has a refernece to the channel to send incoming messages
[18:02:11] <dan01> I could make the Server not have a reference to the Channel, by having the Channel listening on the Stream directly, but then it would have to filter messages that are not for itself
[18:02:21] <MatthiasVance> Why split it out?
[18:02:24] <irwiss> i don't even understand what's "tightly coupled" about this... if both of them need each other and they're part of the same system doing any "decoupling" will just make you jump through abstraction hoops for no reason
[18:02:26] <MatthiasVance> For what purpose are you doing that
[18:02:50] <dan01> MatthiasVance: ture... yeah
[18:02:58] <xb0o2> irwiss: Yeah, I'd just stick an interface in between for testing purposes but I don't think it's unreasonable to have an IRC channel coupled to an IRC server.
[18:03:01] <irwiss> abstraction for the sake of abstraction is just more code and maintenance, ok when you need job security but not for hobby project
[18:03:06] <dan01> Ok, irwiss  is right, fuck it, the Channel knows about the server and vice versa
[18:03:25] <dan01> Server has a joinChannel method that yields a channel and injects itself into it
[18:03:26] <dan01> Done
[18:04:20] <dan01> So which one should have the weak reference?
[18:04:36] <dan01> The server can exist without a channel, but a channel does not exist without a server
[18:04:44] <dan01> So that means? Ehm... Idk
[18:04:47] <xb0o2> Neither, just write it in C#
[18:04:51] <irwiss> neither, you don't need gc tricks to make it behave right
[18:05:11] <dan01> xb0o2: true... Fuck Swift ARC
[18:05:25] <dan01> irwiss: I'm writing it in Swift, which uses ARC
[18:05:45] <dan01> I'm on the C# channel cause you guys rock and Swift is almost like C#

[18:06:44] <dan01> xb0o2: Just don't point fingers at me, it makes me feel bad
[18:06:58] <irwiss> looking at swift's weak reference it's simila to c# and should be no need for it if you let channel drop out of scope when it's no longer needed

[21:22:00] <blez> I don't know what putin can do, except a big war

[21:23:17] <blez> lz_ they don't have the power to do it, except with nukes
[21:23:19] <pandem> but maybe it was naive
[21:23:29] <blez> absolutely naive
[21:23:42] <lz_> blez: hence my hypothesis they'd nuke france and the uk. then they'd have all the nukes with china on the continent
[21:23:50] <blez> the people can't overthrow the persident of russia and china
[21:24:11] <pandem> idk, the people overthrew the ussr
[21:24:14] <blez> lz_ if they nuke them, automatic response will be driven from US (according to docs)
[21:24:22] <pandem> if you have enough people on the streets you can do a lot
[21:24:29] <blez> not in china/russia
[21:24:29] <lz_> blez: sure, but maybe not if the US don't want to end the world

[21:24:43] <xb0o2> lz_: If Russian nukes land in the UK you can guarantee they will be getting some back.
[21:25:06] <blez> if they don't nuke anybody, they'll have to start a war with NATO to keep russia as a whole
[21:25:13] <blez> and martial law => people can't leave
[21:25:22] <blez> and if that's the endgame, it's quite bad..

[21:26:02] <pandem> ukraine is the only place they could nuke without maybe getting something back
[21:26:51] <xb0o2> ... you think you're right that Russia would offensively launch nuclear weapons against two nuclear states and the conclusion would be "they're now the only one on the continent with nukes"?
[21:26:52] <blez> pandem too many nuclear powerplants
[21:27:45] <lz_> xb0o2: fr and uk don't have nearly as many nukes as russia. they could obliterate fr and uk, not sure the opposite is true

[21:28:43] <pandem> they both have like 200 nukes
[21:28:44] <blez> nuking russia isn't a good idea
[21:29:16] <lz_> pandem: sure, and remove from it everything that get intercepted
[21:30:06] <pandem> let's say 50% are intercepted, that's still 100 from each going to russia
[21:30:09] <pandem> plus a bunch from usa

[21:36:33] <lz_> imo MAD doesn't exist. first one to use nukes just wins because there's 0 sense in sending nukes back
[21:36:48] <blez> in this case, what does russia expect to happen?
[21:37:01] <jonp> blez: for everyone to back off and let them take over Ukraine
[21:37:03] <pandem> maybe biden should hire #csharp experts to plan national security
[21:37:10] <xb0o2> Sounds like it pandem
[21:37:18] <blez> there are pictures of tank columns in belarus and kazachstan
[21:37:34] <blez> they seem to expect a big war
[21:37:38] <lz_> pandem: I'm not an expert but no one replied to the question I asked: what sense does it make to send nukes back
[21:37:55] <xb0o2> The same sense it makes in sending them in the first place
[21:38:05] <redoc> ^
[21:38:10] <pandem> what sense does it make to not send them
[21:38:11] <lz_> xb0o2: sending them makes sense if you take the bet the other side won't reply with the same
[21:38:16] <lz_> xb0o2: it's not symmetrical
[21:38:40] <xb0o2> Ok
