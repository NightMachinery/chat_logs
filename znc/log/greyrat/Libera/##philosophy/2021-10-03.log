[04:43:38] <biys> what is sarcastic jovial?
[04:44:38] <biys> i need a way of describing someone who is acting a manner where they're like.  joking and talkative and laughing allt he while experiencing a sense of terror on the inside
[04:45:03] <biys> jovial comes to mind but it's devined as friendly
[04:45:17] <biys> and i mean... even though i'm thinking the interaction is "friendly" it's actually very dark in a sense
[04:45:29] <biys> where the things i might be saying to you would be bitter or rude or cutting
[04:45:42] <biys> but the manenr with which i go about it would be someone wh o's elated, jovial, gitty

[12:02:12] <amigojapan> I don't really understand why people like to use sarcasm
[12:02:38] <amigojapan> It seems to be negative
[12:07:58] <plank> oh sure, right
[12:08:31] <amigojapan> Well I guess that is a joke
[12:08:49] <amigojapan> Jokes are ok
[12:09:04] <mannequin> man i'm craving for vodka ;/
[12:10:18] <plank> then buy some vodka
[12:10:22] <plank> life is short
[12:10:46] <mannequin> it's sunday, stores are closed, i'm broke and i really should not drink because i'm an alcoholic
[12:11:05] <mannequin> so that's not an option
[12:12:26] <kish`> how much do you drink per week?
[12:12:56] <kish`> @ mannequin
[12:13:22] <mannequin> when i'm on the roll half a liter of vodka a day
[12:14:08] <mannequin> but my latest withdrawal was pretty dramatic, basically psychosis
[12:14:19] <kish`> ow :(
[12:14:32] <kish`> how long have you been drinking that much+
[12:14:35] <kish`> ?
[12:14:43] <amigojapan> Life may be short, but it will be shorter with vodka
[12:15:12] <mannequin> well i drink until i get broke
[12:15:18] <mannequin> but i need to fight that
[12:16:05] <kish`> mannequin, do you want to quit?
[12:16:30] <mannequin> yeah but it seems stronger than me
[12:16:57] <kish`> how many years would you consider yourself to have been an alcoholic?
[12:17:05] <kish`> it would help me determine how easy or hard it would be to quit
[12:17:56] <amigojapan> kish`: it depends on the person, each person has a different tolerance to alchohol
[12:18:30] <mannequin> well when you start drinking to fix your mood than it's beggining of an issue
[12:21:49] <mannequin> because it works and you start making it a habit
[12:21:58] <mannequin> and you get used to it
[12:22:20] <mannequin> then you basically get used to it

[12:23:33] <plank> life is too short to spend it shitfaced drunk all the time
[12:23:51] <mannequin> i absolutely loved getting a 4pack of beer at the evening and watching nasl

[12:24:51] <mannequin> have you ever listened to bach or chopin for 1h straight
[12:25:04] <mannequin> then you stopped the music and heard it keeping on playing?

[12:30:19] <amigojapan> mannequin: my addiction is to food
[12:31:02] <mannequin> i also smoke cigs
[12:31:06] <mannequin> for 20 years now
[12:31:42] <amigojapan> I have quit cigarettes for over 20 years too
[12:31:51] <amigojapan> That was hard
[12:33:51] <amigojapan> It is also an expansive addiction
[12:34:02] <mannequin> yeah hits my wallet hard
[12:34:20] <mannequin> i've started when a pack was around $1
[12:34:27] <mannequin> now it's around $4
[12:34:52] <mannequin> abd i'm able to smoke 2 packs a day
[12:35:04] <amigojapan> I think it is over 5usd per pack now here
[12:35:31] <amigojapan> That is the price of a meal
[12:36:05] <amigojapan> Tobacco companies should be held responsible
[12:36:11] <plank> i smoke rollies
[12:36:19] <plank> much cheaper, and more satisfying
[12:36:44] <plank> packs are like $6 for the awful cheap ones round here
[12:37:08] <sdfgsdfg> smoking weed is the cheapest probably, you dont get to smoke it all the time like cigs, just once in a while
[12:37:51] <plank> you also get to be useless all the time
[12:38:21] <amigojapan> I quit marijuana too
[12:38:44] <amigojapan> It's super illegal here in Japan
[12:39:07] <mannequin> rollies are the way to go
[12:39:17] <Digit> mannequin: some suggestions that helped me break other addictions, that may be (at least partly) transferable to alcohol:  Allen Carr's Easy Way (audiobook and paper book), Caryophyllene, Ibogaine (microdosed), Psilocybe Mushrooms (micro and mega/heroic/legendary dosed), Cannabidiol, Wim Hod Method, Ashvagandha (and other adaptogens).

[13:23:20] <pussipupu> They're generally tropical I believe
[13:23:50] <tinwhiskers> and subtropical
[13:24:07] <tinwhiskers> many of the tropical ones are nocturnal as well
[13:25:06] <pussipupu> not not here up north
[13:25:28] <tinwhiskers> yeah, here in NZ they sing during the day too
[13:25:30] <kmh> trying to find general distrubtion map but failed so far
[13:26:02] <kmh> but apparently they occur around the baltic sea and in alpine climates as well
[13:26:22] <tinwhiskers> in the tropics they start singing almost exactly 10 minutes before dark. When they start up you have ten minutes to get home.
[13:27:09] <kmh> but note that "cicadas" is not just used for particular species but refer to lare group of somewhat similar insects
[13:27:36] <Digit> same: "trying to find general distrubtion map but failed so far"
[13:28:18] <tinwhiskers> oddly there was simultaneous discussion of cicadas in ##English
[13:28:51] <pussipupu> not odd, a dictionary lookup inspired by this conversation :p
[13:28:57] <pussipupu> I'm pretty confident
[13:28:58] <tinwhiskers> ah. heh
[13:30:25] <kmh> well i used wikipedia
