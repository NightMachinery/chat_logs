[04:19:14] <S_T_A_N> ButterNoodle, no?

[06:42:11] <isekaijin> rando25892: My old i5 laptop disagrees with your ‚Äúit simply takes more disk space‚Äù.
[06:42:44] <rando25892> no but id rather talk about society' acceptance of linux as a whole than comparing gardening tools
[06:43:04] <isekaijin> My desktop computers could probably run Plasma just fine, but my i5 laptop was noticeably slower when I replaced i3 with Plasma so that I could lend it to my sister.
[06:43:49] <rando25892> well ofcourse if you dont like the loading. power to you its just you still programming in linux so 
[06:44:36] <rando25892> multi core there could be something wrong with the laptop id suspect
[06:44:39] <isekaijin> In 2000 we had reasonably responsive user-friendly UIs, but those don't exist anymore.
[06:45:07] <rando25892> on one processor plasma is efficient as can be
[06:45:33] <amigojapan> isekaijin: on my old laptop cinnamon works ok
[06:45:39] <isekaijin> There's absolutely nothing wrong with my laptop, other than ‚Äúit's not as powerful as a typical webshit's development machine, which is probably the latest MacBook Pro or something‚Äù.
[06:46:17] <rando25892> are you sure though i dont understand you should understand my position. im not saying you are wrong. id just dianosis so you are 100%
[06:48:50] <rando25892> also what is slow even in it the startup?
[06:49:02] <rando25892> does it pause frequently
[06:49:06] <rando25892> maybe you have a bad drive
[06:49:32] <amigojapan> With the latest MacBook Pro you won't even have the option of installing Linux when it is made obsolete by Apple
[06:49:50] <rando25892> maybe not bad per se but a lower quality drive thats slower but functions
[06:50:08] <rando25892> but usually sata drives are really fast you can easily test that by using a pen drive
[06:51:13] <rando25892> and an i5 processor honestly how could it be slow it honestly should not be if i5 good drive ram theres shouldnt "slow"
[06:52:15] <rando25892> maybe the software rastazier is the bottleneck in this laptop
[06:52:37] <rando25892> so you have all the rest just the rastazer sux
[06:53:07] <rando25892> thats the problems with these laptops is somethin malfunction. but on arm kde is fine
[06:53:25] <rando25892> but the gpu ! -eq sux
[06:54:08] <rando25892> isekaijin:  you should try a kernel compile
[06:54:14] <rando25892> worth a shot
[06:56:05] <ButterNoodle> y rando25892 
[06:56:12] <ButterNoodle> I mean I use to
[06:56:16] <ButterNoodle> for reasons
[06:56:52] <rando25892> ill agree with you but maybe x and mesa and x org package tailor to the kernel better therefore the gpu bottlenecking would ease
[06:57:29] <isekaijin> rando25892: Maybe I just have unreasonable expectations of how fast computers should run. When I bought that laptop, it came with Windows 10, and it certainly felt unacceptably slow.
[06:58:06] <rando25892> recognize where you bottle neck is
[06:58:39] <rando25892> toss the laptop and dont think i5 will do that to you cause they are fast. even on gamer nexus he says the new celorons arent better for gaming than sandybridge
[06:59:15] <rando25892> those new dual core celerons are 60 dollars an i5 sandybridge dont let the price fool ya
[06:59:28] <rando25892> shits fast
[07:00:17] <isekaijin> All that I know is that, when I use i3, then it doesn't take half a minute to load the graphical environment.
[07:00:29] <isekaijin> I just type ‚Äústartx‚Äù, press ENTER, and in less than 3 seconds, everything's up and running.
[07:00:41] <rando25892> it may be hard to detect on a laptop perhaps the power is malfunctioning therefore will forever be hidden
[07:00:55] <ButterNoodle> just install windows
[07:01:19] <isekaijin> If I weren't having issues with Xephyr, I'd try Plasma on a nested X session on this desktop computer.
[07:04:01] <rando25892> also my atom AIO run plasma perfect so i know having something like a card isnt your issue i should know better but since you ask i want to be helpful

[07:15:41] <isekaijin> I use xmonad on my main machine, precisely because it's better at handling multiple monitors, but i3wm is lighterweight, which is good for my i5 laptop.
[07:15:51] <isekaijin> A laptop isn't meant to be used with multiple monitors anyway.
[07:15:59] <rando25892> honestly im running cause kde is the general with the gun telling us to fight or die!!!!

[07:17:12] <Satin> nnnnnnnnno
[07:18:29] <isekaijin> PancakeMatsuri: IIRC the proper procedure for using a Mac is first taking 500 bucks from your wallet, tossing them out of the window, and only then turning the computer on.
[07:19:19] <PancakeMatsuri> isekaijin, why being a mac hater?
[07:19:20] <isekaijin> Or if you aren't carrying cash with you, then toss the first two or three credit cards you can find.
[07:19:56] <isekaijin> Just saying things the way they are.

[07:21:14] <isekaijin> I'm sure they're fine computers.
[07:21:25] <PancakeMatsuri> how's M1 unreasonably expensive?
[07:21:28] <isekaijin> But they should cost like 20% or 30% less.
[07:22:20] <PancakeMatsuri> battery on my mac swole 3 times
[07:22:36] <PancakeMatsuri> that is unreasonably expensive
[07:23:08] <PancakeMatsuri> but otherwise, take Asus ROG, it's also expensive
[07:23:27] <PancakeMatsuri> decent Lenovo models also expensive
[07:24:22] <rando25892> another thing isekaijin kde has key binding resolutions. so what you grow to use base inside X server is already running inside kde. its smart enough to know you want to map a control to toggle and untoggle without additional software like you would have to in a window manager

[07:29:09] <isekaijin> Mmm... There's a distinctive lack of cookies in this room, brb.
[07:29:12] <Satin> it's either when i'm heavily heavily stuck in documentation or something
[07:29:21] <Satin> like when i was trying to code that GTK app
[07:29:38] <Satin> or when i'm trying to figure out homework that is taking me multiple windows to keep aside to figure out
[07:29:39] <Satin> then yeah
[07:29:51] <Satin> othrewise, i can't raelly think over the top of my head of an instance where i keep using all 3 at once
[07:30:06] <rando25892> also yea but its hmm if you leave it not on your system and grab the modular packages i dont under any behavoir of avoiding kde. you do use some kde dont you?
[07:30:09] * Satin thinks workspaces in pop-os-gnome-shell are a great feature
[07:30:27] <Satin> i guess most DEs have workspaces
[07:30:30] <Satin> i just like the way gnome does it
[07:30:39] <Satin> or this shell extension rather
[07:30:47] <Satin> just like with i3WM somewhat tho a bit different
[07:31:16] <Satin> $Mod + CTRL + UP/DOWN to shift workspaces
[07:31:27] <Satin> and all three on my monitors get shifted at once
[07:31:32] <rando25892> you cant rate linux as have a smart or dumb, if you grab a kde packages its not any smarter
[07:31:35] <Satin> it's really nice i can keep spotify on the bottom
[07:31:37] <Satin> workspace
[07:31:44] <Satin> and then work with no distraction at the very top one
[07:31:54] <Satin> and then discord and irc windows in the middle etc
[07:32:02] <Satin> middle = distraction workspace
[07:32:33] <rando25892> also it could be counter productive like when people who want to strictly stay alsa. there could be workarounds for mixing sound when you can just do it on pulse
[07:32:49] <rando25892> it sounds a lot like that when you bring it up
[07:34:26] <rando25892> kde has a education site, and when you search the vastness of it, its just pitiful you are saying to keep your software in line with maybe software that has a few websites kde websites is pretty big to have an opinion to bring up about it like that

[08:36:39] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: amigo .. link DunceCotus a definition from flat earth google.. he'll believe u then
[08:36:40] <DunceCotus> vagina + dick looks strange
[08:37:05] <rando25892> so they re missing any fun by themselves and everyone else is
[08:37:10] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: I don't know how to search it
[08:37:14] <rando25892> cause they have both genitals
[08:37:22] <ButterNoodle> u know why amigojapan...
[08:37:34] <ButterNoodle> flat earth doesnt exist
[08:37:38] <DunceCotus> futanari may mean hermaphroditism but that's not how its depicted in manga/anime
[08:37:46] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: hermaphrodites actually exist
[08:37:56] <amigojapan> Lol ButterNoodle 
[08:38:01] <ButterNoodle> DunceCotus: that actually is how its depicted..
[08:38:04] <ButterNoodle> ur thinking of traps
[08:38:09] <ButterNoodle> they are 2 different things
[08:38:50] <DunceCotus> perhaps
[08:38:55] <ButterNoodle> anyway.. its not productive to fuck either
[08:39:03] <ButterNoodle> traps are men
[08:39:09] <DunceCotus> its productive to fuck all
[08:39:26] <ButterNoodle> futas even with a working vagina - are sterile from what science says
[08:39:37] <DunceCotus> who fucks to make babies?
[08:39:50] <DunceCotus> the baby is always a side-effect
[08:40:08] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: many people do
[08:40:16] <ButterNoodle> so the only way to pass on ur genes in cream pie nakadashi baby making sex is with a regular female
[08:40:17] <DunceCotus> an unpleasant surprise from subsequent fuck-sessions
[08:40:19] <ButterNoodle> yea
[08:40:20] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: especially women
[08:40:33] <ButterNoodle> I need a new wife.. to make new kids
[08:40:38] <ButterNoodle> that will take care of me when I am old
[08:40:45] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: they may think they want babies
[08:41:00] <Roey> ButterNoodle: are you married? I know that you have kids

[08:41:04] <ButterNoodle> yes

[08:41:10] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: just make money to take care of you when you are old
[08:41:10] <DunceCotus> he's unmarried with kids

[08:42:43] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: what people want is security
[08:42:51] <DunceCotus> and they see kids as investment into that
[08:43:03] <DunceCotus> but the kids just want to have fun
[08:43:18] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: modern kids won't take care of their parents anymore
[08:43:31] <DunceCotus> so they have to batter the kids into "responsible adults"
[08:43:45] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I am not even expecting that from my kid
[08:44:08] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: it doesn't matter what you're expecting
[08:44:32] <DunceCotus> a kid sees how children are maligned and despised by adults
[08:44:44] <DunceCotus> so desires to not be kid (nor adult)
[08:45:17] <DunceCotus> at some point they grow too big to not be considered an adult at least in appearance, so they are forced to enjoy adulthood
[08:45:25] <DunceCotus> and the cycle continues
[08:46:14] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: really adults are just long-limbed kids
[08:46:24] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I especially hate babies, they look disgusting
[08:46:29] <DunceCotus> freaks of anatomical extension
[08:47:00] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: babies look disgusting because they're prematurely born
[08:47:06] <amigojapan> Babies are monsters
[08:47:19] <DunceCotus> human infants are most helpless of all infants in animal kingdom
[08:48:04] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: babies are monstrous because that's how they get attention
[08:48:10] <DunceCotus> and without attention, the baby withers
[08:48:39] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: every baby has a bit of Trump in them
[08:48:50] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: most people find them "cute"
[08:49:18] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: babies most certainly are not cute
[08:49:28] <amigojapan> Right
[08:49:50] <DunceCotus> they're not even as neotenous as adults
[08:50:04] <DunceCotus> more like born as tiny wrinkly old people 
[08:50:16] <DunceCotus> who slowly grow into more neotenous forms
[08:50:49] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: it may be because of reincarnation
[08:51:00] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: we only truly die when we are old and tired of life
[08:51:21] <DunceCotus> and when we are born again we still carry that elderly fatigue, so we're helpless and wrinkly as infants
[08:51:30] <Roey> and we will alllll go down together ‚ô´ 
[08:51:41] <DunceCotus> the fatigue only dissipates when the amnesia sets in
[08:51:41] <Roey> yes we will allll go downnnnn together ‚ô™

[08:53:30] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: so you believe in reincarnation, at least that is a main stream idea in certain parts of the world
[08:53:31] <DunceCotus> at 5-6 they have taken up a new identity, and to do that in this episteme requires amnesia
[08:54:00] <Roey> heh
[08:54:00] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I believe there are a few different 'after-lifes'
[08:54:22] <DunceCotus> generally we have a period of rest (anywhere from 10-10,000 years in hyperstate)
[08:55:00] <Roey> there exists this Jewish midrash (story) about how the angels teach the baby, before it is born, all the secrets of the torah.. and then right as it is born, they touch him right under the nose, and he forgets it all (having to learn it as he grows up), and that is why we have indentations under our noses :)
[08:55:01] <DunceCotus> this is a timeless state but there's still something of duration
[08:55:12] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: in Japan they believe in something like the river Styx and someone gives you a cup of tea which causes the amnesia
[08:55:21] <Roey> DunceCotus: so wht you said reminded me of that :)
[08:55:48] <DunceCotus> the forgetting is actually just a limitation of our current socius
[08:56:00] <DunceCotus> however forgetting can be productive in transforming the socius
[08:56:14] <DunceCotus> but it can also keep us in cycles of death and re-birth

[08:57:03] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: Buddhism is all about "escaping the cycles of birth and rebirth
[08:57:19] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I do not think anything supernatural causes the amnesia, its more a matter of how desiring-production works under modern socius
[08:57:50] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I am aware of that also, though I would say escaping the cycle truly requires change on Earth
[08:58:13] <DunceCotus> and not just in terms of individual Buddhist practises
[08:58:41] <DunceCotus> it is more about how bodies are produced
[08:59:36] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: without the amnesia we might be overwhelmed by the connections we had formed in our prior lives
[09:00:18] <DunceCotus> however it also occurs due to a tracing over of former connections, that is to say it is a side-effect of the repetition
[09:00:47] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: there is definitely a certain amount of amnesia about when we are small kids
[09:02:20] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: its because small kids have knowledge that can disrupt the social codes we are solicited to trace over
[09:03:06] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: their knowledge is something of natality

[09:04:25] <DunceCotus> so its not just that we repress the childhood memories, they simply were not formed or not formed in the same way as adult memories

[14:40:17] <MootPoot> its rude
[14:40:19] <migod4rk> and gave me cancer
[14:40:21] <amigojapan> MootPoot: you know the US has jurisdiction over the whole world, according to them?
[14:40:25] <migod4rk> possibly diabetes
[14:40:49] <MootPoot> amigojapan: well, yes - but the main thing is that if they deploy it in the US, evidence there still wouldn't be useful to courts here where I live
[14:41:00] <migod4rk> one finger or another has to diddle the backdoor 
[14:41:12] <MootPoot> amigojapan: or, this could just result in a lot of companies just moving to the EU
[14:41:20] <amigojapan> MootPoot: unless you get extradited
[14:41:31] <migod4rk> like dude fro agora
[14:41:40] <migod4rk> well
[14:41:45] <MootPoot> amigojapan: afaik you can only get extradited for crimes committed in the US 
[14:41:45] <migod4rk> ex leader of it
[14:41:49] <MootPoot> so I'm good
[14:41:50] <migod4rk> nope
[14:42:09] <migod4rk> depends on where youre shipping shit to 
[14:42:16] <migod4rk> or what the activity is
[14:42:45] <migod4rk> and jurasdiction per country 
[14:43:12] <migod4rk> if the US HAS jurasdiction as they do pretty much wherever they want theyll do it
[14:43:16] <migod4rk> money game 
[14:43:50] <amigojapan> Ok MootPoot how about assange?
[14:43:58] <migod4rk> that and rico laws 
[14:44:05] <migod4rk> if its a criminal org
[14:44:16] <MootPoot> it was denied though - the families of the people who died in 9/11 tried to get international extradition to work so they could go after people in the Middle east and south asia , they rejected it becuase it would also make the US liable for a lot of external lawsuits as well
[14:44:19] <migod4rk> and they can apply it to said country 
[14:44:27] <migod4rk> again
[14:44:30] <migod4rk> money game
[14:44:36] <MootPoot> amigojapan: afaik he did do it within the domain of the US 
[14:44:38] <MootPoot> something like that
[14:45:01] <migod4rk> yeah but didnt help we shipped all the scrapped metal to asian countries 
[14:45:07] <migod4rk> after the fact 
[14:45:11] <migod4rk> why would they 
[14:45:30] <migod4rk> think logically man 
[14:45:45] <amigojapan> MootPoot: he was not in the US. He just published leaks from whistle blowers in the US
[14:46:00] <MootPoot> his extradition is still ongoing though right?
[14:46:04] <MootPoot> it still hasen't been completed
[14:46:09] <migod4rk> amigo : same w snowden 
[14:46:19] <migod4rk> itll always be 
[14:46:26] <amigojapan> I see migod4rk

[14:47:49] <amigojapan> migod4rk: Ecuador was going to grant abnesty to asange

[14:49:54] <migod4rk> Dunce : me too crew lol
[14:50:24] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: if they scan every message system that includes IRC
[14:50:41] <DunceCotus> oh ok
[14:51:20] <migod4rk> amigo: thats if they arent monitoring already , as they had been bush era 
[14:51:35] <migod4rk> probably long b4 too 
[14:52:00] <amigojapan> migod4rk: but this would be legal, which is different
[14:52:17] <migod4rk> they called it legal when we were wiretapping too lol
[14:52:32] <migod4rk> same shitshow different pile 
[14:52:54] <DunceCotus> monitoring always monitoring

[14:54:15] <migod4rk> amigo: you REALLY believe that shite??
[14:54:29] <migod4rk> Dunce: TRUTH lol 
[14:54:47] <MootPoot> amigojapan: reading it in detail it seems like it needs to pass in congress, then it needs to pass on a state level - if the states just dont adopt their own stronger laws anyway on their own
[14:54:57] <DunceCotus> they're not really trying to control us so much as control flows
[14:55:04] <migod4rk> packets
[14:55:11] <amigojapan> migod4rk: I know it's bs, but we can still argue "you are not following your own law
[14:55:13] <MootPoot> I know internet companies will HATE this since this means they now have to comply to 50 different sets of regulations
[14:55:34] <migod4rk> that and pay more people to monitor orwellian style

[15:14:44] <amigojapan> Even trump got covid
[15:14:47] <migod4rk> amongst other shit
[15:15:04] <migod4rk> couldnt that be to further a narrative
[15:15:12] <migod4rk> he also never wore a fuckin mask lol
[15:15:28] <migod4rk> and blamed china lol
[15:15:31] <amigojapan> Yeah that makes it easy for him to get it
[15:15:44] <migod4rk> thatd make it easy to catch a cold though too
[15:15:53] <amigojapan> Yup
[15:15:56] <migod4rk> or herpes lol
[15:16:02] <amigojapan> Yup
[15:16:08] <amigojapan> Or the flu
[15:16:19] <migod4rk> i mean fuck someone could die of old age naturally and they could say it was covid 
[15:16:26] <Sadale> nya~ :3
[15:16:34] <migod4rk> if you follow 
[15:16:36] <Sadale> MootPoot, damn. you jinxed it
[15:16:48] <Sadale> MootPoot, I had wet dream last night. :<
[15:17:08] <amigojapan> They would need to have other simptoms as for the guidelines
[15:17:28] <migod4rk> ok let me say this in comparison
[15:17:34] <migod4rk> little off topic little not
[15:17:38] <migod4rk> bipolar syndrome
[15:17:45] <amigojapan> Ok
[15:18:05] <migod4rk> has the same key symptoms as borderline personality disorder
[15:18:26] <migod4rk> and bipolar syndrome is one of the most overdiagnosed mental diseases in america
[15:18:36] <migod4rk> see where im goin w this??
[15:18:49] <migod4rk> same symptoms different shit 
[15:18:52] <amigojapan> No and I am not a professional
[15:19:03] <migod4rk> i get that
[15:19:06] <migod4rk> neither am i
[15:19:09] <amigojapan> I am not sure if you are right
[15:19:38] <migod4rk> but if you misdiagnose over the similarities couldnt you in respect do the same w covid and say the common cold or flu?
[15:19:42] <migod4rk> same symptoms 
[15:20:48] <amigojapan> The cold and the flu often also have similar simptoms. But a test can tell if you have the flu
[15:21:01] <migod4rk> exactly 
[15:21:16] <migod4rk> and they still dont have testing down to a science w covid
[15:21:27] <migod4rk> so in respect to that wouldnt you say its possible?
[15:21:28] <amigojapan> True
[15:21:50] <amigojapan> Well the tests can be wrong. I have heard
[15:22:00] <migod4rk> just an opinion and i know opinions are much like anuses 
[15:22:01] <migod4rk> lol
[15:22:07] <migod4rk> yup
[15:22:13] <migod4rk> exactly 
[15:22:38] <migod4rk> and also how many false positives as well as asymptomatic patients as well 
[15:22:47] <migod4rk> also rising 
[15:23:15] <migod4rk> again just opinion im by far as u said no expert as well but mainstream opinion.....
[15:23:46] <amigojapan> They admit there are asymptomatic people, they are often "super spreaders
[15:24:09] <migod4rk> true but same for influenza
[15:24:16] <amigojapan> Yeah
[15:24:47] <migod4rk> so again couldnt this all be chalked up to over or misdiagnosis
[15:25:00] <migod4rk> alls im sayin 
[15:25:28] <amigojapan> migod4rk: I think it would be hard to have the whole world in the grip of fear of there was not even a kernel of truth to what they claim
[15:26:29] <migod4rk> you just furthered my point , they still dont have it to a science , fear is money my friend 
[15:26:36] <migod4rk> .....
[15:26:36] <amigojapan> migod4rk: "covid is fake people"appeared almost from day one
[15:26:44] <migod4rk> ;)
[15:26:47] <migod4rk> yep
[15:27:56] <migod4rk> i dunno man , it all seems with everything nowadays , the things we call "freedoms" and "rights" are going further and gurther out the window
[15:28:01] <migod4rk> further*
[15:28:21] <migod4rk> via premeditated narratives 
[15:28:26] <amigojapan> migod4rk: one thing I do disagree with is that YouTube should but be silencing people that think it is fake
[15:28:39] <migod4rk> same w twitter bro
[15:28:51] <migod4rk> have you read about their policy?
[15:29:00] <migod4rk> shits next level big brother 
[15:29:00] <amigojapan> No
[15:29:18] <treeman5> WHAT IS IT migod4rk 
[15:29:25] <migod4rk> these fools hired a fuckin army to monitor and wipe what they deem innaprpriate or fake 
[15:29:40] <migod4rk> ......yeha
[15:29:50] <migod4rk> look that shit up man 
[15:29:59] <migod4rk> scary shit

[15:30:08] <migod4rk> true
[15:30:23] <migod4rk> just sayin this new bill, its not like its new either 
[15:30:27] <migod4rk> if u follow
[15:30:31] <treeman5> they changed their motto to do the right thing
[15:30:39] <treeman5> but what does the 'right thing' mean
[15:30:43] <treeman5> according to who
[15:30:52] <migod4rk> treeman: for real man

[16:54:13] <MootPoot> it looks the same as I showed you
[16:54:13] <Sadale> MootPoot, If the pic that you sent me on telegram still hold true, I'd actually boost the feedrate because your problem seems to be underextrusion
[16:54:38] <MootPoot> what I'm thinking is that there could have been a mistake on my part
[16:55:04] <MootPoot> when I changed the nozzle - what if I changed it to a .1 or .3/.4 mm one 
[16:55:07] <MootPoot> instead of a .2
[16:56:00] <Sadale> oh.
[16:56:07] <Sadale> MootPoot, I think the default setting is meant for .4
[16:56:11] <MootPoot> is it?
[16:56:18] <Sadale> MootPoot, I think so.
[16:56:19] <MootPoot> the extra nozzles I had were unmarked
[16:56:22] <Sadale> let me check
[16:56:37] <MootPoot> when I export something in cura I always do it at 0.2 mm 
[16:56:38] <MootPoot> lol
[16:56:40] <Sadale> MootPoot, yes it is 0.4...
[16:56:50] <MootPoot> all the nozzles I have are unmarked 
[16:56:53] <Sadale> wait
[16:57:08] <MootPoot> although I only do test prints that came on the sd card
[16:57:09] <Sadale> MootPoot, Are you sure that the 0.2mm defined in cura is nozzle size? It sounds more like layer height to me
[16:57:10] <MootPoot> right now
[16:57:14] <MootPoot> uhhhh
[16:57:20] *** Quits: yakzy (~yakzy@2800:150:120:4cb:b518:a3d5:7f5c:8d3b) (Remote host closed the connection)
[16:57:23] <MootPoot> I'd have to check
[16:57:25] <Sadale> That's because 0.4mm is the most common nozzle size.
[16:58:17] <Sadale> Anyway, your settings have to match the actual nozzle size. If you've installed a 0.2mm nozzle, you need to slice your model for 0.2mm nozzle.
[16:58:37] <MootPoot> I'm just using the default test prints that came with the printer

[16:58:43] <HubertFarnsworth> nya~ Sadale 
[16:58:57] <Sadale> I suppose that should be designed for 0.4mm nozzle.
[16:58:58] <MootPoot> looking at the listing for what I bought it seems like the printer came with a selection of nozzles
[16:59:00] <Sadale> nya HubertFarnsworth :3
[16:59:12] <Sadale> MootPoot, oh. interesting.
[16:59:14] <MootPoot> but afaik I remember them being unmarked

[17:03:57] <Sadale> MootPoot, I'd just stick with 0.4mm because that's what I've been using. Plus, I don't think a lower-end 3D printer like Ender 3 would be able to perform any better with a smaller nozzle. :P

[17:04:58] <MootPoot> 10 dollars for a set of .4mm nozzles and some drills

[17:05:38] <MootPoot> Sadale: what do you use to clean your nozzles
[17:05:43] <MootPoot> or do you just swap nozzles
[17:06:08] <JesseDesu> sounds like a messy hobby
[17:06:53] <HubertFarnsworth> how are you amigojapan?
[17:07:02] <Sadale> MootPoot, there's dedicated cleaner for cleaning nozzle. However I rarely have to use that
[17:07:14] <Sadale> MootPoot, I only have to use that when I fuck up the nozzle somehow.

[17:07:56] <Sadale> MootPoot, the nozzle cleaner is like a kind of needle that's specifically designed for cleaning 0.4mm nozzle. When I bought it, it came with a pack of 10 packaged inside a tiny tube.
[17:08:17] <Sadale> If you've got, says, a 0.2mm nozzle, you'd get the 0.2mm needles.

[17:09:02] <MootPoot> I only have 1 extra nozzle now
[17:09:22] <MootPoot> I was thinking this kit is the same price - I could use it to drill PCBs later if needed
[17:09:34] <MootPoot> same price as those needle ones
[17:10:02] <JesseDesu> you a user
[17:10:07] <JesseDesu> talking about needles
[17:10:13] <Sadale> pffft
[17:10:26] <Sadale> MootPoot, good luck on using this thing for drilling PCB. Hint: chances are that it won't work

[17:10:34] <MootPoot> those are PCB drills though?
[17:10:36] <MootPoot> I think
[17:10:49] <Sadale> MootPoot, those are nozzle cleaning needles.
[17:10:56] <MootPoot> if you google pcb drill is shows the same thing
[17:11:03] <Sadale> what? :O
[17:11:18] <MootPoot> Sadale: some of the kits have those wire needls
[17:11:21] <HubertFarnsworth> yeah, pcb drills are similar
[17:11:23] <MootPoot> this one explicitly says drill bit
[17:11:33] <Sadale> MootPoot, That'd be weird. That's because if you use a drill bit that's strong enough to drill a PCB and put that into the nozzle, I'd imagine you'd break the nozzle hole
[17:11:34] <MootPoot> it is a drill bit
[17:11:38] <Sadale> The nozzle hole isn't that strong
[17:11:47] <MootPoot> is your hole stronger :3
[17:12:06] <Sadale> lol

[22:18:23] <JesseDesu> i dont know what you are talking about but i'm going to try it anyway
[22:18:36] <Aurora_v_kosmose> My printer used to be pretty annoying to setup until Debian 11 suddenly updated cups and when I reconfigured the printing server VM... it just worked without any configuration.
[22:18:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> JesseDesu: So my first advice would be "try updating CUPS"
[22:19:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If your printer is <15 years old, it probably supports airprint.

[22:20:50] <JesseDesu> repository
[22:20:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Hmm... you might be right on the edge and stuck using a Printer Application for your driver then.
[22:21:26] <JesseDesu> i dont know if you're trying to help me or destroy my morale
[22:21:39] <JesseDesu> :[
[22:21:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> JesseDesu: Mostly the former.
[22:22:27] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They tried to streamline things to make them simpler, but Printer Applications are without doubt more complicated to configure than not needing any configuration.
[22:23:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'm not sure if there's prebuilt applications for all the printer drivers they used to have. If yes it might be as simple to get things to work as editing a config file and adding a systemd service.

[22:27:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> fwiw, setting up a printer before this was still a treasure hunt.
[22:27:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Just for the right drivers and filters instead.
[22:27:46] <JesseDesu> it fucking prints in windows
[22:28:09] <JesseDesu> i had this working in lubuntu on my previous laptop but i forgot the steps
[22:28:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> JesseDesu: Yes, which just means some unfair deals have been done with Microsoft to deploy drivers on their platform so it can automagically setup.
[22:28:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Deals that probably involve proprietary drivers instead of just the printing drivers required.
[22:29:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Smartphones led to a general annoyance with that bullshit which gave rise to AirPrint (& similar) to become the new standard to bypass all that bullshit.
[22:29:16] <JesseDesu> i dont really understand these sentences
[22:29:20] <JesseDesu> lol
[22:29:33] <JesseDesu> dont waste your intelligence on my dumbass
[22:29:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Okay so, Microsoft decides what they sign to get on their platform without security warnings.
[22:29:44] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They can mandate whatever they want.
[22:29:53] <ButterNoodle> -mandate-
[22:30:00] <ButterNoodle> anyone looking for  man date?
[22:30:02] <JesseDesu> womandate
[22:30:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Printer makers, especially before smartphone-era, also did bullshit like building a bunch of proprietary extensions to their printing drivers.
[22:30:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Smartphone era caused a general annoyance and a shift away from the generalized incompatiblity engendered by the stupid proprietary extensions.
[22:30:34] <JesseDesu> maybe a reboot will fix this
[22:30:37] <JesseDesu> never know
[22:31:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But unfortunately, the shift is not backwards-compatible and requires shims, which are officially known as "Printer Applications".
[22:31:33] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If your printer is old enough, you can't use it with CUPS without a shim.

[22:34:47] <JesseDesu> i am getting a new printer
[22:34:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> JesseDesu: I mean, yes, that is the easiest option.
[22:35:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But if you wanted to know how to get the old-style working, you wouldn't have other options than to go through the doc & treasure hunt.
[22:35:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But bypassing it entirely is an appropriate response.
[22:35:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You'll also get free ink refills that way.

[23:02:49] <MootPoot> what is more FOSS
[23:03:06] <sentionics> JesseDesu: had a final job interview with a company last week. Today I was told that I did great, but so did another candidate. Right now they're still torn between which of us to hire.
[23:03:10] <JesseDesu> yes, that is why
[23:03:21] <MootPoot> using RFID tags to label my spice bottles in the kitchen vs writing paper labels and using tape
[23:03:43] <sentionics> I kinda hope they go with the other candidate to be honest. I like the easygoing life. But I won't turn down a nice income.
[23:04:00] <MootPoot> sentionics: I have a interview in 30min
[23:04:08] <MootPoot> did you leave your last job?
[23:04:09] <sentionics> MootPoot: ehhhhhh, nice.
[23:04:17] <sentionics> MootPoot: more or less.
[23:04:53] <sentionics> Technically fired, but I deliberately drink my into being MIA for a few days without calling it in.
[23:05:00] <sentionics> *drank myself into
[23:05:13] <sentionics> I hated that last job.
[23:05:20] <JesseDesu> i dont remember what sentionics' job situation is
[23:05:22] <sentionics> I still have my main client so I'm ok at the moment.
[23:05:48] <MootPoot> he dosen't want to work, people keep giving him work, he accepts it, drinks until he quits/gets fired, then repeat
[23:05:53] <sentionics> I make just a little bit more than rent, and have decent savings.
[23:06:19] <sentionics> MootPoot with the 10/10 summary
[23:07:26] <JesseDesu> i dont know whether to nap or drink this bang energy i bought with the chef boyardee and chips and salsa
[23:07:40] <sentionics> probably better to nap.
[23:07:54] <JesseDesu> yes
[23:07:54] <sentionics> sleep deprivation will lay into you.
[23:08:04] <JesseDesu> i need a nap
[23:08:06] <sentionics> and energy drinks will just burn you out faster
[23:08:37] <sentionics> not to mention the half-life on that stuff will contribute to making sleep harder even when you are finally tired
[23:08:43] <MootPoot> sleep is probably the biggest thing
[23:08:49] <MootPoot> imo
[23:08:52] <MootPoot> it effects SO much
[23:09:43] <sentionics> MootPoot: much agreed. I'm finally at a good sleep schedule. Well, as of last night. But... it always drifts on me as I'm pretty irresponsible about consistently getting rest at a specific time.

[23:12:31] <JesseDesu> thats me
[23:13:07] <sentionics> I'm the opposite. I have to avoid too much stimulating stuff. Though it is hard as heck to get up in the morning, but only b/c I tend to get less than full rest.
[23:13:25] <JesseDesu> i should put the salsa in the fridge
[23:14:17] <sentionics> I basically drink mostly just water, milk, and from time to time (read every other week), alcohol. I really need to quit the drinking. I think I'll get there sooner or later.
[23:16:39] <JesseDesu> i need a 90 minute sleep cycle
