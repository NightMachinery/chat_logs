[00:48:08] <zamba> how do you guys handle databases in a dockerized environment?
[00:48:29] <zamba> it doesn't take many projects to see that one database per project maybe doesn't scale that well
[00:48:42] <zamba> but pretty much all of them requires one
[00:48:53] <ikke> nothing would prevent you having a single db shared with multiple projects

[01:31:12] <programmerq> zamba docker doesn't care how your split up your processes. It really boils down to what components you want to share across projects and what your tolerances are for one project impacting another. you can do whatever type of config you'd like-- docker won't force you to run one db per project, but that's something that you might see when you look at example for any one given project so it can be a
[01:31:14] <programmerq> complete example. You'd just need to configure the app to use whatever db you want it to, and that's that.

[17:15:22] <wez> zamba: For a good reason
[17:16:35] <zamba> how can i prevent unattended upgrades from restarting docker engine?
[17:18:32] <programmerq> zamba▸ depends on your os. usually there's a way to pin a package to a specific version. "apt-mark hold", for example.
[17:18:38] <zamba> programmerq: ubuntu
[17:18:57] <programmerq> restarting daily doesn't suggest upgrades are doing it. You might have some other process that's restarting it.
[17:19:18] <zamba> no, it's not daily
[17:19:27] <zamba> but it seems like it's happening around the time cron.daily runs
[17:19:31] <zamba> but not every day
[17:20:33] <zamba> https://dpaste.org/JW5o
[17:20:43] <zamba> that brought everything down
[17:25:45] <tabakhase> unattended upgrades either shouldnt be a problem cause you set everything up to be safe and restart + have a fallback structure setup already - or you simply shouldnt be using them...
[17:26:58] <zamba> but will it help if i added containerd and docker to the blacklist of packages not to update?
[17:31:51] <programmerq> you can use apt-mark hold to prevent upgrades
[17:34:16] <zamba> programmerq: i added docker.io and containerd to the blacklist
[17:34:33] <zamba> in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades

[22:42:14] <programmerq> rawtaz▸ by default, networks you create are not internal-only. the default behavior is to allow egress. setting internal=true disables the egress on that particular network. Handy for container-to-container networks for cases like a database container that really really really doesn't need any type of internet connectivity.

[22:43:09] <rawtaz> ok so internal:true makes that network such that the container cannot go to another network using it
