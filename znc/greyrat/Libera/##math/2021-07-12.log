[04:34:47] <buster> actually gets quite far into bundle territory, but i didn't appreciate it until now
[04:35:27] <johnkeats6> the yang-mills lagrangian is basically the integral of the curvature of a connection. and gravity is of course due to curvature. so curvature explains all known forces of nature
[04:35:36] <johnkeats6> you can say it's an important concept

[04:40:57] <buster> not in terms of connections, but we covered serret-frenet, gaussian curvature, and the like in an elementary context at school. was interesting at the time.

[06:57:38] <buster> yes (hence top groups are homogeneous)
[06:57:53] <Fangs> then 1a and 1b follows immediately
[06:58:03] <buster> sure, they're not hard
[06:58:17] <Fangs> I think inverses are defined to be a homeomorphism too
[06:58:25] <Fangs> so iii is.. odd
[06:58:38] <buster> yes, i thought so
[06:59:15] <buster> 1.(ii) gives you a hint for 1.(i). and you use 1.(i) for 2.

[07:00:33] <Headwind> is there a standard notion of "independence" in the context of relations? i mean similar to statistical independence, but without a measure of probability
[07:00:39] <Fangs> buster: I like these sort of exercises.. they duped you into proving something "nontrivial" by yourself
[07:00:55] *** Joins: Carbonflux (~Carbonflu@c-24-56-228-141.customer.broadstripe.net)
[07:01:13] <buster> Yeah, I enjoyed them
[07:01:42] <Fangs> Headwind: idk if there's another notion of independence, but the only two I know are in the sense of linear algebra (and abstract algebra), and the other is probability-related stuff
[07:01:55] <Fangs> and I don't think the two are inherently releated
[07:03:37] <Fangs> let ab = c, and let W be an open nbhd of c, then A = a^{-1}(W) is an open nbhd of a, B = b^{-1}(W) for b.. then AB c W (I still have to figure this out)
[07:03:45] <Headwind> in the case of a binary relation it seems clear enough: suppose we have a relation R over sets A and B. then we can "project" R on A and B, to get the sets of possible values A0 and B0... and the "sides" are independent if for all a in A0, b in B0, aRb
[07:04:26] <buster> Fangs, GxG->G; (x,y)->xy is continuous (in the product topology on GxG)
[07:04:30] <Headwind> you can think of it as probabilistic independence with a uniform distribution, i guess, but i don't want this to be quantitative
[07:04:49] <buster> that one took me a while
[07:04:51] <Fangs> buster: I'm just not sure how you show its contained in W
[07:05:06] <Fangs> oh
[07:05:31] <Fangs> you dont explicitly construct the open sets for A and B, m:GxG -> G is cts, so the preimage of W is an open set
[07:05:52] <Fangs> which would contain a and b respectively and whose product is in W
[07:05:54] <buster> yeah. you get the U and V because ... cylinder sets ...
[07:06:02] <Headwind> i'm trying to understand how this generalizes to an n-place relation
[07:06:56] <Fangs> Headwind: an ''obvious'' generalization is to mimic random variables I guess, couldn't you say they're all mutually independent?

[07:07:41] <Headwind> i need to define what it means to be independent in this context, or find an existing definition (which is even better)
[07:08:08] <Headwind> like, given a specific R... are components 1 and 3 independent? etc
[07:08:42] <Fangs> johnkeats6: do you know much about group cohomology?
[07:08:49] <johnkeats6> no
[07:08:58] <Fangs> not even for lie groups?
[07:09:00] <buster> well, the topology on a finite product has a base of 'basic open boxes' so we can get a UxV subset W containing (a,b) that way
[07:09:32] <Fangs> buster: I was thinking of just projecting the preimage open set
[07:10:32] <buster> does that work? the projections are continuous, but not open maps. would a and b necessarily be in the interiors?
[07:10:32] <Fangs> johnkeats6: do you know of any rep theory book for lie groups that also talks about stuff at the group level?

[07:14:00] <Fangs> johnkeats6: for the circle, its universal cover is just R
[07:14:17] <Fangs> so if its 'homotopy equivalent' you'd expect the universal cover to be nice too
[07:14:43] <johnkeats6> well it is contractible as well
[07:14:54] <johnkeats6> homotopy eq spaces definitely have homotopy eq universal covers
[07:15:27] <Fangs> I'd expect something dumb like R^n or R^oo

[10:50:10] <voldial> Hopefully, my question elucidates the theorm I am looking for... What's the most efficient encoding of binary data that does not have NUL as a symbol? I found base91 and base94 and https://qntm.org/unicodings but these are still binary -> text encodings. I'm curious about the maximal case, where "only" NUL must be encoded... clearly base-254 is not possible, but how do I calculate what is possible? What's the
[10:50:12] <voldial> serialization format that uses the most bytes except 00000000?

[20:32:23] <Headwind> let's see if i can ask my question better today. is there a standard notion of independence between unknowns, given a relation constraining these unknowns? intuitively, something like statistical independence, but without a quantitative notion of e.g. a probability measure

[20:35:39] <Headwind> in the case of a binary relation, it seems clear enough. let's say we have R over sets A and B. we can "project" R on A and B, to get the subsets of A and B involved in the relation - say, A0 and B0. then the two unknowns (from A and B) are independent if for all a,b in A0,B0, aRb holds
[20:37:05] <Headwind> if there's an offending pair (a,b), then conceptually knowing (wlog) the first half is a gives information about what the second half is

([cos(theta) - w_{2n}^{n-1}] + [cos(theta) - w_{2n}^{n-1}]*), where w_{2n} = exp(i(pi/n)) is a generator of the 2n-roots of unity, so im guessing using z^{2n}-1/(z^2-1) = 1 + z^2 + ... + z^{2n-2} is going to be

[23:43:52] <int-e> rubiksdream: Right, I finally sorted out my mistakes and I agree with that.

[23:44:57] <int-e> z =  exp(i(theta)), 2cos(theta) - w^i - 1/w^i = (z-w^i)(z-1/w^i)/z where w is a 2n-th primitive root of 1.
[23:46:29] <int-e> As you multiply, w^i and w^-i span roots of x^(2n) - 1 except for 1 and -1, so you divide z^(2n)-1 by z^2-1.

[23:47:21] <Izem> why use the square root to remove a square algebraically instead of log?

[23:51:10] <int-e> you can do sqrt(x) = exp(log(x)/2), but that's usually making things more complicated rather than simpler

[23:54:20] <rubiksdream> yeah, apparently that comes out to sin(n(theta))/sin(theta), after some work int-e
