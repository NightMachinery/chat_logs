[01:00:01] <quanticle> Why do patients in mental institutions get so little attention in the public discourse? Isn't the point of having a mental institution to get the patient out of the public discourse? Seems like the system is working as designed.

[01:02:51] <kuudes> haven't they done covid censorship for some time?
[01:03:13] <ggreer> yeah but in this case they deleted a video of an interview with the guy who invented mrna tech who was also talking about other treatments

[01:05:43] <kuudes> quanticle, well, yes, language is a barrier - the media over here noted such disinformation was available in finnish, but youtube instantiated banwords also for finnish when told what they are

[02:31:13] <TheWhisper> The battery connector is on the wrong side
[02:31:22] <saturn2> how did that happen?
[02:31:30] <TheWhisper> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
[02:31:42] <TheWhisper> > Made in China
[02:31:57] <quanticle> Is that little cable not long enough to reach now?
[02:32:47] <TheWhisper> I think it should be. I haven't tested yet. But, I'm concerned about having the cable under the battery, squished against the metal of the phone back
[02:33:18] <saturn2> yeah, those ribbon cables aren't designed to withstand pretty much any mechanical stress whatsoever
[02:34:08] <saturn2> also the polarity might be wrong
[02:34:29] <TheWhisper> I was also concerned about that too. If they couldn't even get the orientation right, what else is wrong
[02:34:38] <TheWhisper> I love ifixit's guides, but so far their battery replacements are junk
[02:34:41] <quanticle> I bet the spec for the cell didn't specify whether the cable had to be on the front or the back, so different manufacturers chose different internal orientations.
[02:35:07] <TheWhisper> Replacement battery 001: damaged, bent corners. Immediately went in the bin
[02:35:35] <TheWhisper> Replacement battery 002: Went in fine, I've been using it for ~5 months, but it never performed well. It'd consistently shut down around 30% battery with no warning.

[02:37:37] <TheWhisper> It really is a great phone! 
[02:37:46] <galambo> Im keeping it for the google photos
[02:37:51] <TheWhisper> haha same
[02:37:53] <quanticle> Yeah, the New York right to repair law is pretty weaksauce; in addition to ignoring spare parts, it exempts the automotive and medical sectors *entirely*
[02:38:07] <TheWhisper> I will keep this thing alive forever just for unlimited Google Photos
[02:38:50] <TheWhisper> Anyone have any suggestions? Should I not screw around and just RMA the battery?
[02:38:51] <galambo> TheWhisper, I no longer use it. My daily driver now is an eink phone. but I love the OG google pixel. feels right in the hand. no camera bump. it has a headphone jack. stock android.
[02:39:12] <galambo> unlimited google photos uploads
[02:39:25] <galambo> whats not to like?

[02:42:14] <synthmeat> i'm fairly unhappy with iphone mini. nothing that i didn't know before purchase, but i didn't think i'm gonna not like it this much :/ low battery capacity, doesn't lie flat on back, no touch id
[02:42:33] <synthmeat> size is great though, both screen and device
[02:43:07] <galambo> synthmeat, I wish I had a phone in the form factor of the iphone mini with an eink display. it would solve the battery issue with small phones
[02:43:32] <galambo> and a headphone jack
[02:43:59] <synthmeat> and this glass back is really hard to get your mind around. i *know* that it's pretty solid, but it *feels* so vulnerable

[02:44:37] <synthmeat> that plus cameras sticking out make me anxious every time i'm laying it down
[02:46:13] <galambo> I think the way I solved the battery life and fragility of phones was genius. I set a budget of £250. If the battery becomes bad or the phone breaks I just buy a new phone.
[02:46:53] <saturn2> TheWhisper: it's probably there to prevent things from touching the metal back and also to dampen parasitic capacitance

[02:47:36] <TheWhisper> It's genius, except it ignores the main reason I don't want to change phones — mine is heavily customized and changing devices sucks on Android.
[02:48:56] <synthmeat> i don't wanna change phones either. ran with SE for 8 years. i'm planning on getting similar mileage from this one as well.
[02:49:07] <galambo> TheWhisper, true but I think you need a backup device in any case. you dont want to be phoneless if your phone breaks for any reason
[02:49:21] <galambo> og google pixel is a good backup phone

[02:50:35] <synthmeat> TheWhisper: lol, part above the battery looks like it's growing chest hair
[02:50:37] <TheWhisper> galambo, true, I do have a backup phone. A Galaxy S7 that I got as an insurance replacement several years ago, and immediately tossed in a drawer
[02:50:41] <saturn2> TheWhisper: unless you think the foil is sharp enough to damage the battery, it looks fine
[02:50:51] <TheWhisper> It's not sharp at all
[02:51:02] <TheWhisper> synthmeat, that's the phone body. Battery not shown :D

[02:55:14] <galambo> TheWhisper, fwiw I switched from the google pixel 1 > pixel 2 > hisense A5. I love all of these phones. the hisense a5 is now my main phone.
[03:04:59] <galambo> there have been observations that there hasnt been a cultural shift since the early 2000s. I think one of the implications is that the demographic of people in their 40s and 50s is kind of similar to millenials
[03:06:07] <quanticle> There hasn't?

[03:07:46] <galambo> quanticle, I meant more like music, movies and tv shows. wokism is definitely a big change
[03:08:22] <synthmeat> there's definitely been big changes in all of those
[03:08:57] <galambo> synthmeat, so why is there no mention of the 00s like we do the 70s or 90s?
[03:09:25] <synthmeat> because of the time distance. no doubt you'll have 00s nostalgia in decade or two
[03:09:39] <saturn2> i think that has more to do with everything being focus grouped

[03:27:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hey you guys remember how we a while back we talked about pancakes, and the difference between what delicious pancakes look like and what lame commercial pancakes look like
[03:27:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://imgur.com/gallery/aMuh9Sp
[03:27:34] <Robomot> Pancake precision - Imgur
[03:27:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is how those absolutely featureless pancakes are made
[03:28:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Note how there's no fat of any kind used to fry them
[03:28:39] <synthmeat> aren't those plates oiled or at least sprayed with oil?
[03:28:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe sprayed but very lightly
[03:29:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or the griddle could just be seasoned very well
[03:29:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> But the pancakes get no oil or butter, you see
[03:29:48] <synthmeat> don't they have milk?
[03:30:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sure they have milk, but that's not the same as *frying* them in some kind of fat
[03:30:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And I'd wager the batter is milk / flour / baking powder, no cultured milk products)
[03:30:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> So these are going to taste exactly as bland as they look
[03:30:46] <synthmeat> i don't put any oil or butter in my crepes either, but i do use fattest milk i can find
[03:31:36] <spxtr> tiny amount of butter in the pan is all I use

[03:33:12] <synthmeat> then again, whatever crepes taste like is dwarfed by the filling anyways, so form is more important than taste, i guess.

[03:34:43] <quanticle> (inb4 someone mentions RISC-V)

[03:37:01] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: Wait, were those pancakes supposed to be appetizing?
[03:37:10] <quanticle> The ones in the video you just linked, I mean.

[03:37:35] <spxtr> if they have a really nice texture, they could still be alright
[03:37:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> synthmeat: No, crepes should taste good by themselves
[03:37:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> So should pancakes
[03:37:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Mine certainly do

[03:38:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Comment: "Rush Limbaugh said he was able to travel to many different countries as a young man, hated all of them and decided USA was the best country"
[03:38:18] <TheWhisper> superz_, that sounds like what someone who has ascended to another plane of existence would say. Maybe they're Dr. Manhattaning on us?
[03:38:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Now, no comment on Rush Limbaugh in particular, but ... pretty much same
[03:38:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> I've been to a bunch of countries
[03:38:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> They're all bad and America is the best.
[03:38:50] <quanticle> It brought to mind that comment you made a while ago when I posted some extremely elaborate thing made out of chocolate. "That's not food, that's a sculpture made out of components that happen to be edible." Similarly, I look at those pancakes and think, "That's not food, that's just an edible plate."
[03:39:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Well, Israel is cool. I mean, it's not *cool*, it's actually very hot and that's why I wouldn't live there)
[03:39:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> (But other than the heat it's pretty cool.)
[03:39:28] <saturn2> it's just a sponge to help you consume maple-flavored corn syrup
[03:39:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Exactly :\
[03:39:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And don't forget butter)
[03:39:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> (By which I mean margarine)
[03:39:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Gotta stay healthy after all)
[03:40:03] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: My mother has been to India, Italy, the UK and France and she thinks the US is the best country
[03:40:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Makes sense
[03:40:18] <quanticle> Though, the UK did convince her that trains are cool and we could do with more of those.
[03:40:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Trains can be cool
[03:40:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> They can also be shitty
[03:40:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'm a fan of cars tbh
[03:41:01] <synthmeat> Obormot\Arcturus: what? that's news to me. (wrt margarine)
[03:41:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Cars can be overdone but the car as a concrete instrument of personal freedom is one of the best things about American culture
[03:41:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> synthmeat: I was being sarcastic, margarine is terrible for you
[03:41:18] <synthmeat> gotcha :)
[03:41:31] <quanticle> spxtr: I would have to taste those pancakes to be sure, but they don't *look* like they have a good texture.
[03:41:43] <quanticle> Pancakes are supposed to be fluffy and somewhat porous
[03:41:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> synthmeat: Lots of people eat it because it used to be advertised as healthier

[03:43:02] <RiversHaveWings> yeah namespace is fine, we talk a lot still?
[03:43:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway the point with these pancakes is ... people, especially Americans, will totally be like "ooh look they're so perfectly round and flat and uniform, I WANT IT" and they'll get this idea that this is what pancakes should be like
[03:43:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> These pancakes are the modern web design of pancakes
[03:43:20] <quanticle> lmao
[03:43:25] <quanticle> It's true

[03:43:37] <synthmeat> Obormot\Arcturus: lots of people aren't even aware of the difference, is my observation. not to mention all the ways brands go to confuse you.

[03:45:46] <TheWhisper> The ones you linked look good. Sort of like matzo meal pancakes.
[03:45:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> They are not matzo meal, lol
[03:46:08] <TheWhisper> Yeah, but they look like what my matzo meal pancakes look like
[03:46:35] <synthmeat> fritters are the worst. i literally have nausea now thinking about them.

[03:49:22] <quanticle> Can't really go wrong
[03:49:51] <synthmeat> well, it's not corn (over here), it's just regular dough, fried. smth about it that literally makes me puke.

[03:50:47] <synthmeat> it's not even that they're not tasty, it's just an adverse reaction on my end.
[03:51:24] <quanticle> Probably the excess of oil. In India, they have a dish called puri. It's deep-fried roti, more or less. It's deemed to be a breakfast food. When I was last in India, my grandma made puri for breakfast and I just could not handle it
[03:51:34] <quanticle> Even the smell of the hot oil was too much
[03:51:35] <nshepperd> I've only heard of fritters *of* something. like banana fritters: deep fried banana pieces
[03:51:45] <quanticle> I was just like, "Give me a glass of milk"
[03:51:58] <synthmeat> quanticle: exactly like that.
[03:52:09] <nshepperd> a nothing fritter sounds like some sort of Zen joke
[03:52:21] <TheWhisper> hey
[03:52:28] <synthmeat> yeah, i don't know if there's a specific name for fritter without anything.

[07:11:57] <quanticle> Did he just drop a brick of pride onto someone?
[07:13:03] <ggreer> it's common in certain countries to throw gays off of rooftops
[07:16:30] <quanticle> Is it? I thought the standard punishment was to bulldoze a pile of rocks onto them.

[09:51:58] <quanticle> CoJaBo: Is there a site or a file or something that they could be referring to?
[09:53:19] <CoJaBo> quanticle: The first one came in without a reference site, so it was sent thru our main support portal by someone who was incredibly lost, or it came in via email
[09:54:58] <quanticle> Weird
[09:55:18] <quanticle> Yeah, there is definitely a context that could make that request make sense, but without one...
[09:55:32] <CoJaBo> This happens all the time, our support platform is just awful
[09:56:05] <CoJaBo> My best wild guess so far is med student taking a course? Maybe that's more hope than logic tho.
[09:56:20] <CoJaBo> The second one was just inconsolably dumb.
[10:16:06] <quanticle> I mean, do you run web sites for restaurants or something as well? Maybe they weren't satisfied with their meal.

[19:00:30] <RiversHaveWings> so: train on CLIP text embedding + CLIP score + VQGAN tokens
[19:00:43] <RiversHaveWings> or train on CLIP text embedding + CLIP image embedding of VQGAN tokens + VQGAN tokens
[19:01:00] <RiversHaveWings> (To sample from the latter you would then put the desired CLIP text embedding twice)
[19:01:55] <RiversHaveWings> (I was thinking maybe the model didn't have enough information about *how* exactly the tokens deviated from the desired text embedding, only the degree to which they did?)
[19:02:51] <RiversHaveWings> However.
[19:03:09] <RiversHaveWings> The DT often produces better results now when I condition on a lower CLIP score when sampling, such as 0.5
[19:03:48] <RiversHaveWings> With putting the text embedding twice there's no obvious way to do this, since you would have to pick a *particular* second embedding that had the desired cosine sim to the first one
[19:04:01] <RiversHaveWings> Rather than just stating the cosine sim you want
[19:04:09] <RiversHaveWings> And letting the model satisfy it any way it knows how
