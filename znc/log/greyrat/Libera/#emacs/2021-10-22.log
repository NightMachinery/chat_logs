[02:36:52] <twb> Catie: when you pass through TeX you have to be all "oh if you use left-handed amharic on a wednesday then you need to patch the .sty to include THIS extra package"
[02:37:18] <twb> Whereas when using princexml it's just "got the .otf?  Done."
[02:37:38] <Catie> Yeah, LaTeX is kind of archaic in a lot of ways
[02:37:47] <webshinra> latex is not very usefull for simple document like documentation
[02:38:00] <webshinra> it can do the job, but it's a bit overkill
[02:38:10] <twb> webshinra: we're not talking about writing latex; we're talking about using it as a PDF layout engine
[02:38:37] <twb> Because princexml is nonfree :-(
[02:38:40] <bremner> twb: yeah, using latex as a rendering engine is pretty gross
[02:38:47] <bremner> but so is non-free software
[02:38:54] <twb> and stuff like rst2pdf is very buggy and shit

[06:14:11] <jirido> so this install-info, is that a linux command or some emacs command?
[06:14:22] <Guest-liao> What is "install-info"
[06:14:24] <rnkn> it's part of makeinfo
[06:14:32] <jirido> right
[06:14:56] <rnkn> info is the GNU doc system which can operate standalone or inside emacs
[06:15:11] <jirido> Guest-liao: it made a dir file that incorperate elisp.info ito the info tree

[06:25:09] <rnkn> the built-in package system will work better
[06:25:30] <jirido> but that loads all packages
[06:25:44] <rnkn> you install packages from the list-packages menu, they will be added to the option package-selected-packages
[06:26:21] <jirido> It looks really god and makes loading of keybindings tied to the loading of the packages also
[06:26:23] <rnkn> then if you move to a new system and want to reinstall those packages, package-install-selected-packages will install everything
[06:26:47] <rnkn> that's kind of pointless

[19:24:10] <wasamasa> there are a number of problems with that
[19:24:22] <johnjay> hrm i'm going through all the folders starting with A
[19:24:34] <johnjay> mostly either empty folders or like random 2.2 kernel patches people have
[19:24:37] <johnjay> maybe i was wrong
[19:24:47] <acdw> why does elisp yell at me if i don't use the right functions?
[19:24:53] <akater[m]> Guest10: Use region-specialized (interactive "r") declaration, for starters.
[19:25:00] <hsv> empwilli: most recent for perl was 12 mentions in 2018.
[19:25:10] <wasamasa> like, if you replace a short word with a long word, you end up with a longer region than initially
[19:25:32] <wasamasa> which could push legitimate text that was in the original region beyond its boundaries
[19:25:42] <wasamasa> for which it's best to use markers, as those move with insertions/deletions
[19:25:54] <Guest10> Guys could you show me how to define a simple function to do that I tried to do? I think I will learn from that. It should be a 4 liner I believe
[19:25:55] *** Joins: shicz (~shicz@123.103.9.7)
[19:26:02] <empwilli> I see at my workplace that there is the one fraction that automates everything in perl and the other guys that do python and that more or less all infrastructure slowly migrates to python
[19:26:06] <Guest10> wasamasagot it
[19:26:17] <wasamasa> to avoid doing one pass per substitution, it's better to use a regular expression matching all search terms and replacing depending on which one was matched
[19:26:18] <grym> empwilli: the yaml must be farmed 
[19:26:29] <wasamasa> I'm currently explaining why it's not a four line solution, lol
[19:26:44] <wasamasa> the problem is trickier than it looks like
[19:27:34] <Guest10> wasamasa ah, ok. sorry. Do yu think there are any alternative solutions? 
[19:27:43] <wasamasa> yes, using a keyboard macro
[19:27:58] <hsv> why write 5 lines of bash when 20 lines of python and a couple of library dependencies will do?

[19:41:05] <wasamasa> suppose your buffer contains "foo bar" and the region spans from 1 to 7
[19:41:11] <wasamasa> you replace "foo" with "ridiculous"
[19:41:31] <wasamasa> your search is over because point is at 9 and over the original bound
[19:41:41] <wasamasa> and you can no longer replace "bar" with "example"
[19:42:29] <johnjay> sadpepe face
[19:42:48] <johnjay> of course I always write those loops as while end of buffer not reached so
[19:42:59] <johnjay> hopefully that still works with narrowing
[19:43:02] <wasamasa> I find elisp programming that does actual text editor things surprisingly tricky
[19:43:19] <johnjay> is that beacuse of emacs or because of text editing
[19:43:33] <johnjay> or even more deep - our own cognitive perceptions of the universe
[19:43:48] <wasamasa> because buffers are very different from the usual text processing done in other programming languages
[19:44:04] <wasamasa> the only saving grace is that word exposes an even stranger API than emacs

[21:11:54] <rpav> hsv: can't have #inline on the prior line?
[21:12:18] <andinus> it does render it when i use `emacs -Q`, i tried init bisect - looks like when i remove (org-babel-load-file) from my init.el, it prints the toc

[21:12:40] <rpav>  
[21:12:45] <andinus> i inspected the .tex files, the only change is that, one with emacs -Q writes sections like

[21:12:53] <hsv> rpav: i split the line, edit the function, then re-join the line.

[22:22:49] <john_johnk> Sorry
[22:23:00] <john_johnk> It's friday, had a hard week 
[22:23:21] <john_johnk> So as you can see my indentation is really ....bad :-)
[22:23:43] <john_johnk> How could I equalize my aliases without passing through all the lines 
[22:23:55] <rpav> C-M-l?
[22:24:08] <rpav> ok no apparently not

[22:24:23] <rpav> why doesn't conf-mode have a good indent
[22:24:28] <john_johnk> C-M is Ctrl+M right ?

[22:27:13] <artefact> select them with the mouse, then <tab>
[22:27:45] <john_johnk> nop it indented only the first one 
[22:29:22] <john_johnk> it indents only the line on which my cursor is 
[22:30:17] <artefact> i don't know. if it worked with the whole buffer marked it should also work with any region

[22:34:35] <rpav> yeah i'm fairly anti-terminal these days, and definitely for emacs, but otoh emacs -t is better than noemacs
[22:34:38] <john_johnk> you need to mark the beginning of the selection with control-space and move the cursor (point) to the end of the selection. then hit <tab> ---> the selection is perfect but when i hit tab
[22:34:49] <john_johnk> it deselect the selection and nothing happens

[22:39:41] <artefact> ok, emacs thinks this is correctly indented i guess
[22:39:55] <john_johnk> ah ok :-(
[22:40:20] <john_johnk> Can i perhaps specify a number of indentation
[22:41:17] <john_johnk>  with C-M-\ RET
[22:41:25] <Bayes> how infuriating is it when you get somebody to tell you exactly the opposite of what you previously agreed with them, mostly because they never slow down and think things thru
[22:41:49] <john_johnk> or with M-g g 6 C-@ C-u 11 C-n or  C-SPC to drop a mark, then C-n to get multiple lines
[22:42:17] <john_johnk> Bayes why the opposite ?

[22:43:09] <john_johnk> Just want to learn humbly eemacs
[22:43:38] <john_johnk> Perhaps I am telling the opposite of what you said because i did not understand properly
[22:43:51] <john_johnk> That is the most probable explanation
[22:44:27] <Bayes> no, easy, I was complaining about something else
[22:44:41] <rpav> speaking of git and rust and rewriting stuff (we weren't really of course), you'd think rust people would start with something like "let's rewrite git in rust!" instead of going full-kernel straight away

[22:50:03] <Donatzsky> Rust gives you C/C++ like performance, without (most of) the securitity issues, would be the short version
[22:50:45] <rpav> c++ is to me the right choice widespread product release if for no other reason than like a million people understand the compiler, and any bugs it may have, and hte standard, and probably how to fix any issue you encounter .. really don't want to be at the whim of "well the compiler is broken here and no-one knows why"

[22:56:48] <artefact> no, space is just space. tapped, not held
