[17:08:13] <Demosthenex> ok, i'm working on my letter template again with org and latex. specifically i want ALL the required information to make this document specified inside the org file, no dependency on init.el, etc
[17:08:29] <Demosthenex> looks like i'm not able to use macros in the latex header :P
[17:08:59] <ngz> No, macros are really meant as text replacement, not meta-data replacement.
[17:10:01] <Demosthenex> yeah, but they seem to not work later in the doc either :P
[17:10:14] <ngz> Well, that's another story.
[17:10:39] <Demosthenex> yeah, i see where. i have a begin/end latex block, and the {{{macro}}} isn't expanded in it
[17:10:55] <Demosthenex> so basically, if it's not org native it won't expand
[17:11:15] *** Joins: madix (~madix@april/staff/madix)
[17:11:25] <ngz> Indeed. A macro can replace Org contents, not anything else.
[17:11:36] <Demosthenex> so, org's builtin's like title, author, etc, don't seem to expand in the latex header area either
[17:12:14] <Demosthenex> maybe i should just migrate this all to a style file
[17:12:44] <Demosthenex> but... again... i really would like to have everything in the one file. i've found that i go back to recompile an old document and often my emacs/org has updated and i have to fiddle with it for an hour...
[17:13:29] <ngz> Org syntax is pretty stable these days, though.
[17:13:44] <ngz> But, yes, some incompatible changes happened in the past.
[17:14:09] <ngz> I think all configuration can be done through keywords, in the document.
[17:14:21] <ngz> At least in koma-letter export back-end.
[17:14:53] <Demosthenex> yeah, i'm trying to do class none, and specify the document class using org's #+latex_header, along with all my config
[17:15:06] <ngz> Ah.
[17:15:19] <Demosthenex> https://dpaste.org/XuMr
[17:15:26] <Demosthenex> again, minimize dependencies
[17:15:37] <Demosthenex> i'm sure i could take this simple letter format and make it a style file :P
[17:16:56] <ngz> Probably
[17:17:11] <Demosthenex> but a style file creates a dependency :P ugh
[17:17:34] <ngz> Not if you generate it through a source block before export ;)
[17:17:46] <Demosthenex> what's getting me atm is how
