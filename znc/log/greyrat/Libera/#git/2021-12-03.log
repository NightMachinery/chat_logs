[10:29:57] <saltrocklamp[m]> is there a way to get git to show the different md5 hashes when two binary files differ?
[10:30:03] <saltrocklamp[m]> other than just the "binary files differ" message
[10:30:44] <dermoth> saltrocklamp[m], you can show the tree object, all objects ate recorded there by sha1
[10:30:57] <dermoth> where the file resides
[10:31:10] <saltrocklamp[m]> sure, it should be possible to rig that up in `git diff` interactive output, right?
[10:31:36] <saltrocklamp[m]> i can set an external diff driver for specific files, but i don't know of a way to do it for all files that are determined to be "binary"
[10:32:46] <dermoth> ha, doing that through a drive, i'm not familiar with that sorry
[10:33:02] <saltrocklamp[m]> i am reading https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes under "Generating diff text" but i don't really understand how to act on what it's telling me
[10:33:19] <saltrocklamp[m]> i'm not sure what these "Set", "Unset", etc. sub-headings refer to
[10:33:58] *** Quits: rgrinberg (~textual@187.251.13.114) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[10:36:31] *** Joins: ubique (~ubique@79.113.171.30)
[10:38:32] <dermoth> well you need to set up a driver, I think it's fairly well documented in gitattributes but there may be easier to follow tutorials around. Then for some commands you will have to also give it --ext-diff to use the driver for the diff (ex git log)
[10:38:57] *** Quits: vishal (~vishal@fedora/vishal) (Quit: ZNC 1.8.2 - https://znc.in)
[10:39:29] <dermoth> but then if you just make it print the object or checksum, you will see the diff as being -+ 1-line in log --stat
[10:40:26] <dermoth> also use the object hash if you can, this avoids reading the file so it will be much faster. but it may not be possible with drivers.
[10:40:31] <saltrocklamp[m]> yeah for now i just did it with a driver for the specific file i wanted, i have a `[diff "md5"] textconv = md5`  already in my config
[10:40:53] <saltrocklamp[m]> let me see if i can use the object hash itself, i guess i can just invoke `git` from `textconv = `
[10:43:11] <dermoth> actually you can, diff programs are called with these arguments: path old-file old-hex old-mode new-file new-hex new-mode
[10:43:45] <saltrocklamp[m]> i just saw in the manual that textconv only gets one argument. for now this is just visual display so textconv is fine with me
[10:43:51] <dermoth> use command=
[10:44:12] <saltrocklamp[m]> i think i prefer md5 because it's easy enough to cross check against other tools. but it looks like i can get the hash of a file with `git rev-parse :${filename}`
[10:44:34] <dermoth> look for GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF in gitattributes(5) and git(1)
[10:44:54] <dermoth> your diff script would get the object hash directly
[10:45:01] <dermoth> no need to read / compute checksum
[10:45:09] <saltrocklamp[m]> ohh i see
[10:46:15] <dermoth> note though even being sha1, the result is slightly different as git appends somethijng to the object (I forgot what exactly...)
[10:46:17] <saltrocklamp[m]> given that these are not really "valid" diffs/patches, is that a good idea?
[10:46:21] <dermoth> $ g cat-file -p c3fdeb07588a1e7548fc4ca686e1638676029f27|sha1sum -
[10:46:21] <dermoth> 4574958a04d8fbe694f164dfc97660cd4fd099d1  -
[10:46:56] <dermoth> it won't be good for submitting patches over email. maype prepend with somethging ot make it clear it's the object hask or checksum

[17:24:07] <dminuoso> Pinchiukas: commit objects point at a tree, and that tree points at blobs
[17:24:08] <jast> git stores complete snapshots of all versions of all files, where each file is identified by a hash of its content, meaning files are automatically deduplicated (and it uses fancy delta compression in the background so that it doesn't take up tons of space for many small changes)
[17:24:20] <dminuoso> Pinchiukas: so roughly, git stores snapshots (but in an efficient sharing way)
[17:24:21] <jast> and any diffs and such are calculate from two commits on the fly

[20:09:56] <jast> (pending support for --autostash in the former case, I guess)
[20:12:42] <jast> hm, there isn't an option for `rev-list` to terminate when finding the first merge, right? that would be quite useful for my script :)

[23:23:23] <Hamled> Hi. I'm using an application that does the following commands as part of a package management process, and it is failing (when the last command returns no revisions): https://upaste.de/oWp Performing those commands myself, I see that the git fetch command is adding .git/shallow so there is no tag ref in the repo...
[23:23:23] <Hamled> The documentation for git-fetch says that the depth parameter works differently if the repo is already shallow, but there was no shallow file before the fetch command. Are empty repositories inherently shallow, and is there any kind of config setting to alter that behavior?
[23:24:38] *** Joins: lkor (~lionkor@beammp/staff/lionkor)
[23:26:54] <rewt> there's a `git init` there, so there's no repo contents; it's neither shallow nor deep
[23:28:37] <Hamled> so a `git init` followed by `git fetch --depth` is supposed to work the same as `git clone --depth`?
[23:29:10] <rewt> pretty much

[23:31:01] <Hamled> And this presumably didn't change recently, right? I'm trying to understand why the application would be written to work this way when it seems like it could never work (setting aside the possibility that this functionality was just never tested)
[23:33:16] <rewt> what doesn't work?
[23:33:47] <rewt> if <some-rev> is a branch/tag that doesn't exist on the remote, then there's nothing you can do to make it return a commit hash
[23:33:57] <Hamled> the rev-list command says the tag is an unkown revision (and doing `git rev-list --all` returns nothing)
[23:34:25] <rewt> do you see the tag if you do a full clone?
[23:34:33] <Hamled> it does exist, and when I did the fetch I got `* tag v0.11.0 -> FETCH_HEAD` but there's nothing in `.git/refs` and it just downloaded the objects and made a `.git/shallow` file
