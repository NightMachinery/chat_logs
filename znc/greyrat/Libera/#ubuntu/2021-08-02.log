[00:19:26] <TJ-> kraiskil: OK, so there is no full disk encryption, so this isn't an encrypted Ubuntu install

[00:27:10] <kraiskil> lol
[00:27:17] <TJ-> kraiskil: if you've got encrypted $HOME using ecryptfs then right now are you logged in as yourregular user, and can you see your usual files in $HOME or just the .Private .ecryptfs Access-Your-Private-Data.desktop and so on?
[00:28:25] <kraiskil> TJ-, everything works as normal. I can see all my files in /home. I was just perplexed as I assumed I had full disk encryption her
[00:28:26] <TJ-> kraiskil: in a properly working ecryptfs configuration you should NOT be asked for the encrypted passphrase since it is sync-ed with your user password.
[00:28:41] <kraiskil> yeah, that makes sens.

[00:29:06] <TJ-> kraiskil: if you were asked for the password previously, that tells us the ecryptfs password and your user password had become de-synced and were different
[00:30:02] <TJ-> kraiskil: the above usually happens when you manually change your user password with "passwd" rather than the GUI tool (which knows to sync the gnome keyring password with user password). When those are synced the ecryptfs passphrase is also synced

[04:14:45] <Guest13> the badblocks? If I write off the badblocks then there might be system binaries missing, can ubuntu check for missing files and replace them?

[04:18:06] <Guest13> Yah, I believe I can pass badblocks to fsck and try to repair it. If I try that, the drive must not be mounted, is that correct? So I will have to do it from a live disk?
[04:19:20] <yukiup> i don't remember
[04:19:24] <Guest13> If I am able to write off the badblocks, will I still need to do a full install of ubuntu, or might I be able to recover.  The system currently boots, so nothing too critical is damaged.
[04:20:24] <leftyfb> Guest13: I personally do not take a chance with my data. If there are bad blocks, buy a new drive, reinstall and restore from backup. Anything else is begging for more issues
[04:20:26] <Guest13> Okay, I am going to try it from a live disk. I don't have much to loose at this point.
[04:21:05] <Guest13> leftyfb, I have all new hardware on order. I am trying to just get by until it arrives.

[09:49:54] <alkisg> I was writing some pages in the ubuntu wiki in the past; then I realized that software documentation should be managed/maintained upstream as much as possible
[09:49:55] <alkisg> Only distro-specific documentation should be maintained in distribution faciliities. Same for bugs; launchpad.net is a mess because they were accepting bugs with no software maintainers there

[09:52:00] <Bashing-om> alkisg: Yeah - maintaining our docs has sure fallen from what it used to be - I am glad to see a movement to improve this situation.
[09:52:23] <alkisg> I think the policy needs to be changed; not a "call for engagement"...

[14:31:59] <bobdobbs> thanks :)
[14:33:11] <oerheks> add this to /etc/bash.bashrc ( for all users) or  ~/.bashrc for your account
[14:33:20] <bobdobbs> will do
[14:33:49] <bobdobbs> The path stuff I understand (for the most part). It's permissions that I find a little challenging.
[14:34:32] <bobdobbs> oerheks: if I'm right, the script should be owned by root, executable by everyone, and writable only by root. Does that sound right?

[23:10:20] <newb134> Hi, where do I file a bug for the podman package ?
[23:10:43] <newb134> I am newb to podman, I am trying to do the comand podman pull ghost but I get the following error Error: error getting default registries to try: short-name "ghost" did not resolve to an alias and no unqualified-search registries are defined in "/etc/containers/registries.conf"
[23:10:57] <ash_worksi> oerheks: thanks

[23:15:22] <athos> newb134: did you check /etc/containers/registries.conf ?
[23:16:19] <athos> in impish here, it just came empty :) you could add a few registries there, such as docker.io, and try pulling your images
[23:17:33] <newb134> I did have a look other pulls seem to work fine from docker.io e.g. podman pull ubuntu
[23:18:06] <newb134> and the hello world script works too

[23:19:55] <athos> newb134: that is because there are images registered here => /etc/containers/registries.conf.d/shortnames.conf
[23:20:20] <athos> newb134: also, if you try using the full qualified names for those images, your pulls should work
[23:20:35] <athos> newb134: e.g., docker.io/IMAGE

[23:28:41] <athos> and do check the note in the end on the risk of using unqualified image names
[23:29:13] <athos> tl;dr: the registries were not added on the config file for a reason
[23:29:22] <newb134> will do thanks

[23:52:51] <dakotakae> Not much, really. I was having an issue with PolKit a couple weeks ago (it wouldn't let me enable linger for a user), but I got it worked out. I just found out recently that things were moved to Libera instead of Freenode. I was just wondering when the switch happened.
[23:53:00] <sarnold> dakotakae: a few weeks ago
[23:53:51] <leftyfb> dakotakae: in May
[23:54:35] <dakotakae> Yep, that would explain it. I haven't been in the Ubuntu IRC for about a year now. What motivated the change?
[23:54:59] <leftyfb> dakotakae: feel free to discuss in #libera or maybe #ubuntu-irc
