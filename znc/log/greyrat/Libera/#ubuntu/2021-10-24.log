[09:50:37] <vershan> Require expert advise. Sony Vaio Laptop. When installing ubuntu 20.04, its start to boot from USB thereafter goes to live CD. The moment it enters there is a shutdown signal and computer powers off. What is strange is that it happens if I try again. I have tested a different USB, different media, different ISO. Its the same thing. I noticed that if I removed the BIOS battery and tried, it worked again, but now removing the BIoos battery
[09:50:37] <vershan> it still sends a shutdown signal. I'm swapping hard drives hence want this to work again.
[09:52:42] <lotuspsychje> vershan: you could try an F1 switch to textboot when your liveusb is running, to see at wich step your laptop shuts down

[10:00:48] <vershan> ive sent a pastebin with hardware
[10:01:17] <lotuspsychje> vershan: from the moment you see ubuntu logo/circle loading you can F1
[10:01:52] <vershan> lotuspsychje: so apart from that is there anything else I could perhaps try?
[10:02:51] <lotuspsychje> vershan: you could try another flavour of ubuntu too, like lubuntu 20.04 to see if you can reproduce your shutdowns
[10:03:30] <vershan> lotuspsychje: thank you i will swap over HDD's now and give that a try
[10:03:33] <vershan> thank you
[10:03:44] <lotuspsychje> vershan: what kind of harddisk are you using? spinner? ssd/nvme?
[10:04:05] <vershan> lotuspsychje: its a 500gig spinner
[10:04:25] <vershan> but the issue also happened when i installed on this 80gig HDD that I'm currently using
[10:05:15] <vershan> when the shutdown signal is sent, its too quick for me to grab the info to troubleshoot more.
[10:05:54] <lotuspsychje> vershan: could be a motherboard fault too, or something else trigger its shutdown
[10:07:06] <vershan> lotuspsychje: i am some what in agreement, because to start the laptop up, the power needs to be plugged and plugged in again every single time on start up. the battery is 0% only running on AC power

[10:10:30] <vershan> lotuspsychje: so i should just clean up and test again. I'll remove bios battery, drain power. remove battery. clean up and try again

[14:55:04] <Jenshae> 20.04.3

[14:56:59] <Jenshae> I am using LXDE desktop.
[14:57:06] <cbreak> the kernel module and the userland should have the same version
[14:57:24] <cbreak> 2.0.2-1ubuntu5.1 is what I have here in 21.04
[14:57:26] <Jenshae> How do I fix it? How did they mix match?
[14:57:34] <Jenshae> O.o
[14:57:54] <cbreak> I kind of expected ubuntu's package manager to handle this
[14:57:55] <Jenshae> Can I safely downgrade it?
[14:57:58] <cbreak> but apparently it didn't
[14:58:32] <cbreak> if you upgraded  your pool (zpool upgrade or manually enabling new features) then no
[14:58:56] <Jenshae> This is a tortured install. I should really reinstall the whole thing or make a Debian build but I am learning from all the band aid work and a full install is a mountain of config to get back to this position.
[14:59:27] <tomreyn> Jenshae: i just checked, 20.04's linux-image-generic-hwe-20.04 and linux-image-generic-hwe-20.04-edge still point to linux 5.11, whereas impish (21.10) has linux-image-generic 5.13 - so it's unlikely that you're running the same kernel version.
[14:59:58] <Jenshae> 5.11.0-38-generic x86_64
[15:00:14] <cbreak> funny.
[15:00:19] <cbreak> that's the same I have in 21.04
[15:00:23] <tomreyn> that's probably focal's linux-image-generic-hwe-20.04
[15:00:33] <cbreak> isn't 20.04 supposed to be more in the past?
[15:00:48] <tomreyn> not on hwe
[15:00:51] <tomreyn> !hwe
[15:00:51] <ubottu> The Ubuntu LTS enablement stacks provide newer kernel and X support for existing LTS releases, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack
[15:01:07] <cbreak> so ubuntu broke their hwe kernel / userland compatibility?
[15:01:07] <Jenshae> It really does think it is 20.04 - "Kernel: 5.11.0-38-generic x86_64 bits: 64 Desktop: LXDE 0.10.0   Distro: Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS (Focal Fossa)"
[15:01:10] <cbreak> at least for zfs
[15:01:38] <Jenshae> I think it is more user error but I was having these problems before I tortured it.
[15:01:39] <cbreak> Jenshae: don't know if this is the cause of your corruption though. But it is not good

[15:13:48] <xu-help55w> Ah, I see
[15:14:56] <tomreyn> another option would be to install windows into a VM (from a downloaded iso file, running under the ubuntu host system), then use that windows installation to write a bootable windows installer on a usb storage. but that seems like a lot of effort.
[15:15:47] <xu-help55w> A lot of effort, of course. I've heard it's not that easy to make VM use USBs properly
