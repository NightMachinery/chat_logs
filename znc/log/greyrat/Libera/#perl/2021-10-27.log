[01:15:04] <skyl4rk> if I do my %h = (x=>next_from_file(), y=>next_from_file()); is the order of the calls to next_from_file well-defined; if it reads a byte every time, will x always have the first byte and y the second?
[01:17:31] *** Joins: proller (~p@2a02:6b8:b081:6409::1:10)
[01:20:25] <ology> I would think so. The RHS is an ordered list.
[01:20:27] <rewt> comma is left-associative, so x's call should be evaluated first
[01:21:05] <rewt> also make sure next_from_file() returns a single value instead of a list in list context

[01:22:23] <xenu> In list context, it's just the list argument separator, and inserts both its arguments into the list. These arguments are also evaluated from left to right.

[01:36:25] <Grinnz> the usual undefined behavior situation is actually not about order of operations but how things happen in the optree; my @stuff = ($x++, ++$x) will assign two values to @stuff, but those values are effectively aliases in the stack until the final assignment and it isn't defined what value the rest of the expression will see

[02:05:01] <sivoais> jaytee80: i had a chance to look into that build issue some more and found out it is because libc's complex.h defines `I` as a macro. So not PDL's fault per se. But made a PDL issue to track it.

[02:08:40] <skyl4rk> Grinnz: I think that as long as the function calls are done in the expected order, there should be no problem, in my particular case.
[02:10:41] <jaytee80> sivoais: Thanks. Is there a possibility to add warnings into the pdlpp compiler saying "DON'T USE SINGLE CAPITAL LETTER VARIABLE NAMES YOU DOLT"?
[02:12:24] <sivoais> hahah, that wouldn't be hard to do and it might be a good practice to encourage from a maintenance perspective
[02:12:27] <skyl4rk> Grinnz: also, thanks. I assumed first your initial note of $x++... was for a different issue
[02:12:40] <jaytee80> Once it gets to XS or C and the macro gets expanded there all hell breaks loose with the error messasges
[02:16:39] <jaytee80> If one wanted to reaaallly over engineer it pdlpp could test compile code with all var names and make sure they don't get expanded with C macros along the way. That would certainly catch _everything_ that could possibly cause this macro clash problem.

[02:18:36] <sivoais> not a bad idea! it would require some way to get at the preprocessor for the current compiler. i know how to do with with gcc
[02:20:01] <sivoais> so: gcc -E , cl /P, clang -E
[02:20:20] <sivoais> that does cover the majority of the cases
[02:20:36] <jaytee80> I wonder how many PDL writers still use exotic stuff like portland or icc, etc. I would guess not many.
[02:21:12] <jaytee80> Can you use a compiler for PDL different than what was used to compile perl? 
[02:22:25] <sivoais> ok, you're not supposed to, but I have a hack in the CI for PDL that does that ... replaces gcc with clang... they are close enough that it isn't a problem. Now I don't know about Intel, but at some point I want to try to use their SDK in the CI too
[02:23:03] <sivoais> PDL's CI also tests Apple's Clang on macOS which is much more common than whatever hack I did

[11:24:47] <Ovid> But to be safe, you could create an object who's entire purpose is to live to the end and *its* DESTROY block would be set correctly. However, destruction order of things in Perl isn't deterministic, so that's often a dangerous thing to do.

[15:44:23] <ne2k> I've got a serial to tcp device that spits out lines once a second. I'm currently using IO::Socket::INET->new(...) and doing while(<$socket>) to process a line at a time. I want to multiplex this with other operations so was going to use IO::Select, but I figure that can_read won't know that a whole line is available. is there an easy was to multiplex and get a line at at time?

[15:45:35] <ne2k> (the serial to IP converter spits out chunks of 8 or 16 bytes at at time)
[15:45:52] <ne2k> I could build those chunks up and wait until I get a newline and then process, but I was just wondering if there was something cleaner
[15:47:05] *** Joins: rwp0 (~rwp0@user/rwp0)
[15:47:25] <merpaderp> ne2k: buffer it up in $buffer, and then do while ( $buffer =~ s/(.*)\n/ ) right after read from socket
[15:47:53] <merpaderp> so you read bunch of bytes, no big deal, append them to $buffer, and then read from buffer until \n
[15:48:08] <merpaderp> if there is no line yet, nothing will be done in while()}{}
[15:48:23] <merpaderp> that's how I have done it numerous time
[15:48:26] <merpaderp> s
[15:48:27] <ne2k> that won't actually eat it off the front of $buffer, though, will it?

[15:49:12] <ne2k> oh, sorry, you put s///
[15:49:19] <ne2k> that's very clever
[15:49:43] <ne2k> you meant while ($buffer =~ s/(.*)\n// ), I presume?
[15:49:46] <merpaderp> I think I saw it in some bot building Perl book, from late 90's or early 2000's, so clearly a common technique
[15:50:13] <merpaderp> yes, sed the line out, s/(.*)\n//, so it returns first line in $1 and removes it from buffer
[15:50:23] <merpaderp> I might have borked the syntax but you get the idea
[15:50:48] <merpaderp> and don't use /g global modifier, it doesn't play nice in while loops :)
[15:51:03] <ne2k> merpaderp, thanks. I don't write Perl very often these days, most nodejs, but trying to port something to run as a quick hack on an embedded device that I can't install stuff on; it has Perl and python and... well, you know
[15:51:17] <ne2k> nono, /g returns an array of matches, eh, which we don't want
[15:51:29] <merpaderp> I see you know your Perl well
[15:51:56] <ne2k> merpaderp, yeah, I still like it for one-page things, but my team are less keen on the line-noise
[15:52:05] <merpaderp> I once had a /g there and spend some time banging my head why its not working, hence the warning
[15:52:51] <ne2k> and do I have to read a byte at a time with sysread here?
[15:53:27] <ne2k> or is it recv?
[15:53:46] <merpaderp> hmmm
[15:54:01] <merpaderp> I think you should read POSIX::BUFSIZ
[15:54:20] <merpaderp> eval: say POSIX::BUFSIZ
[15:54:22] <perlbot> merpaderp: No output.
[15:54:28] <merpaderp> eval: use POSIX; say POSIX::BUFSIZ
[15:54:30] <perlbot> merpaderp: 8192 
[15:54:42] <merpaderp> that much bytes, but it reads as much as is available on the socket? so no big deal?
[15:55:14] <ne2k> $sock->recv($buffer, $length); this looks weird
[15:55:17] <merpaderp> wait for someone more knowledgable to chime in, before you take merpaderp's word for it
[15:55:36] <merpaderp> I think there was another flag, so it appends to buffer instead of rewriting it
[15:55:50] <merpaderp> sysread FILEHANDLE,SCALAR,LENGTH,OFFSET
[15:56:12] <merpaderp> so, sysread( $fh, $buffer, POSIX::BUFSIZ, length($bufer) )
[15:56:19] * GumbyPAN CPAN Upload: EAV-XS-0.6.4 by TVV https://metacpan.org/release/TVV/EAV-XS-0.6.4
[15:56:30] <merpaderp> so it appends to $buffer, instead of truncating, will never had a line this way.
[15:56:53] <merpaderp> or write it in two lines, my $mini_buffer where it's read and then append to big buffer in $buffer
[15:56:56] <ne2k> feels weird to be passing a buffer for it to write to rather getting the read bytes as the return value

[15:57:41] <merpaderp> I guess, that is lower level function or something
[15:57:42] <ne2k> and, for that matter, how can it modify the argument?!
[15:58:06] <merpaderp> why wouldnt it?
[15:58:27] <ne2k> I guess I've just forgotten that Perl can do that

[17:57:19] <khosruw> "The story of Perl is a very sad one as it went from one of the top web programming languages, but, as time went on, it became viewed as a write-only language which triggered its demise.

The developer community 
[17:57:22] <Altreus> is it related to trepan?
[17:57:25] <khosruw> noticed this problem and created Perl6, but it was not enough to keep Perl in demand. In the end, it had a good run, but it would be better to forget about this language and focus on something that is popular right now.

[19:43:00] <Altreus> I need Syntax::Keyword::Except again
[19:43:32] <Altreus> map { $_ except { delete $_->{data} } } @$record_data
[19:44:06] <lopid> where's the assignment? there is an assignment?
[19:45:21] <jaytee80> rocky 8 rpm of Chart::Graph::Gnuplot slayed. Not 100% proud of what I did, but it breathes.
[19:45:33] <Altreus> lopid: your assignment is to write Syntax::Keyword::Except
[19:45:42] <ne2k> what could that possibly mean?
[19:46:01] <Altreus> rocky 8? Didn't they stop at like 5?
[19:46:32] <lopid> :)
[19:46:41] <jaytee80> Basically rocky 8 ships with a pretty minimal capability gnuplot that doesn't have all of what C::G::G needs. So I reverted to the EL7 version of gnuplot and rebuilt that. It needed 281! additional rpm deps. No wonder EL8 ships the more minimal version!
[19:46:54] <mst> *lolsob*
[19:47:13] <ne2k> what is except supposed to do?
[19:47:27] <jaytee80> And then tests for C::G::G still fail because they try to use the ancient deprecated 'pgm'

[19:48:46] <mst> I don't remember when it started working
[19:49:17] <Altreus> I was gonna say, I can also take type/host from the hashrefs, for which I'd be grateful for the version in which $_->%{qw/type host/} works
[19:50:20] <Altreus> I just did that^ but the long way
[19:50:28] <Altreus> so I don't get told off in code review for being unclear
[19:51:07] <jaytee80> I'm even less proud of my plan to make PerlQt work. That f'er hasn't compiled in a decade, so I have to use the EL7 rpm... that puts stuff in site_perl/5.8.8. My plan is to create a second rpm that doesn't nothing but create symlinks to put the files in the right libpath. I gotta run some test first... but that's the hackiest thing I've ever done

[20:16:03] <ilmari> that's been the case since fedora 34 and rhel 8, yes
[20:16:29] <ilmari> it used to be much worse, the 'perl' package would give you what's now in 'perl-interpreter', and you had to install 'perl-core' to get all the core modules

[21:08:54] <Altreus> Any apache-based monolith stuck on 5.14 is naturally not going to be doing anything that makes new modules a trivial request
