[16:23:38] <drmpeg> I'm not sure. Increasing the thread count doesn't break things, it just slows it down.
[16:24:11] <drmpeg> So the thought is that the overhead of threads is greater than the benefit.
[16:24:38] <drmpeg> But nobody has ever done a deep dive on it.
[16:25:18] <adam-sayad[m]> I also discover if FFT overflow it dose not tell the runtime !
[16:26:08] <adam-sayad[m]> The flow just don't work without seeing "O" char in console, and back to work good after decrease sample rate 
[16:27:28] <willcode4[m]> FFT doesn't overflow - it acts as a choke point, causing the source to overflow.
[16:28:44] <adam-sayad[m]> willcode4[m]: and this happens without printing "O" ?
[16:29:48] <adam-sayad[m]> Because my flow don't work without any cpu 100% load or without printing "O" char in console !

[22:51:41] <patchvonbraun[m]> gr-osmosdr and gr-soapy(sdr?) are two different approaches to providing a "universal hardware abstraction" for various bits of SDR hardware.  gr-osmosdr was first, and then SoapySDR.  The feeling in the community is that Soapy is "nicer" and "cleaner".  So, as of GR-recent, SoapySDR was brought "in skin".
