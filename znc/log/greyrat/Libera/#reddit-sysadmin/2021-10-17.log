[10:41:05] <Cl0udNinja> true. my biggest problem is that no one seems to be able to tell me if on an input for like web/http, if you input a multi line request (GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHeader: Value\r\n....\r\n\r\n") whether each line is parsed individually, or if I will get all lines

[10:43:54] <sd> 15<R​ika> Whichever is possible
[10:45:43] <Cl0udNinja> wouldnt streaming imply that the ethernet chip receives the entire request then?

[10:51:36] <Cl0udNinja> the chip has a 2kb buffer, yes. but when does it dump it or raise the interrupt, when it receives one line, or when it sees a double \r\n?
[10:51:38] <sd> 15<R​ika> Actually no the streaming I believe is that chip receives -> buffer -> application consumes buffer
[10:51:41] <sd> 15<R​ika> At the same time

[10:58:31] <sd> 15<R​ika> Is the chip on a breakout already? If not lol do you know how to solder SMD
[10:59:04] <Cl0udNinja> I built a reflow oven but I have to take it apart again because the temp sensor is touching the side
[10:59:56] <Cl0udNinja> of course its not on a breakout. I bought it when I was going to do my first attempt at this project like almost 2 years ago, but after I got my boards realized I fucked up and fell down a rabbit hole a redesigning it 10 times

[22:50:07] <Alternity> as an interviewer all I really care about is your work experience and the projects you've done

[22:50:30] <spiderman> I write cover letters if I really want the job
[22:50:55] <Alternity> if you send me your resume as a word file that's also a big negative

[22:55:55] <Alternity> what's the job
[22:56:05] <sd> 08<t​herottenapple> because they offer rotations of different parts, cybersec, networking, sysadmin, traditional helpdesk
[22:56:17] <sd> 08<t​herottenapple> data engineering, database management

[22:57:56] <sd> 08<t​herottenapple> windows and virtualization, service management, platform services
[22:57:59] <Alternity> but any projects you have related to computer science and general will help put that powershell script on GitHub include a link to it in your resume honestly any scripting or programming you done I put links to
[22:58:05] <sd> 08<t​herottenapple> I'll probably target the networking/sysadmin
[22:58:57] <sd> 08<t​herottenapple> they are looking for python and powershell experience too

[23:00:33] <bloody> dont they teach programming in schools now?

[23:01:00] <spiderman> do they teach sysadmin shit in schools?
[23:01:17] <Alternity> depends you're on your major if you're doing computer science and most cases there's a lot of programming doesn't mean people remember it though or take it seriously
[23:01:33] <bloody> I thought programming was a class high schoolers take now
[23:01:33] <spiderman> I did CS and I had one sysadmin class as an elective and it SUCKED
[23:01:35] <Alternity> at least in the USA 2-year schools will teach it specific whereas for your schools generally do broader computer science curriculum
[23:02:03] <spiderman> I learned everything I know from working
[23:02:11] <Alternity> also a lot of times computer science programs will teach crap like Java first which will turn a lot of people off instead of something more useful and easier like python
[23:02:13] <spiderman> and look at me now, failing rhcsa tests
[23:02:24] <Alternity> same I failed out of college after about 2 years
