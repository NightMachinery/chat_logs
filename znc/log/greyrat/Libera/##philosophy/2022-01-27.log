[01:00:36] <dTal> xx wants to know what an "ethical framework" is
[01:01:01] <dTal> I'm not sure I'm the best person to attempt to explain
[01:02:01] <dTal> also, hello everyone
[01:04:13] <dTal> xx - when you say that we "ought to" do this or that, which is a phrase I've heard you use, you are implicitly drawing on an ethical framework
[01:04:47] <dTal> one way of looking at an ethical framework is that it's basically a statement about the world you want to live in
[01:06:27] <dTal> when people say things like "it's wrong to kill", what they mean is that they think a world where people don't kill each other is preferable to a world where they do
[01:06:36] <xx> you're likely paraphrasing me, because I'm unsure about the expression "ought to" compared to "should" or other terms
[01:06:46] <xx> hence I never intentionally say "ought"
[01:07:26] <dTal> sure, I'm paraphrasing, but the intent is clear - you sometimes suggest that one course of action is in some way better than another
[01:07:42] <xx> true
[01:08:31] <dTal> so the question becomes, how do you define "better"? And do other people agree with that definition?
[01:09:51] <dTal> there's a saying, "you can't get an 'ought' from an 'is'". It means that no amount of facts will bridge the gap into guiding your actions - at some point, you must inject preference
[01:10:10] *** Quits: T3ddy (uid500881@id-500881.lymington.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[01:11:04] <xx> I'm reading up on what all this ethics is, since in my mind it is always something that boils down to some religious stuff
[01:11:51] <dTal> We may disagree about many particulars of what shape we'd like to see the world, and perhaps also in our opinions on how we might most effectively achieve those goals - but for us to meaningfully cooperate in *any fashion*, we must agree on *something*.
[01:12:08] <xx> true
[01:14:31] <dTal> Now, concerning our various conversations until now: when I look deep into my heart at the things I value, when I try and dig down to my simplest, most basic preferences about the future shape of the world, I find it difficult to come up with something more compelling than "humans should continue to exist".
[01:15:46] <dTal> I could possibly identify a superior value, like "intelligence and creativity and love should continue to exist", which theoretically could supercede humans per se, but it's not really been a practical concern for me since all those things are best expressed in humans.
[01:16:39] <dTal> Now, you've expressed a preference for human extinction before. What I cannot wrap my head around is - why? What value is being served by that?
[01:16:58] <xx> but do you have a good reason for why humans should exist?
[01:17:09] <dTal> Yes! I just gave it.
[01:17:28] <krb> the mystery of consciousness
[01:17:34] <dTal> I value things like intelligence, love, creativity. I value them intrinsically.
[01:17:45] <xx> but in your point there are humans that don't have intelligence nor creativity nor love, so should they not exist?
[01:18:40] <xx> dTal: are you aware of https://www.vhemt.org/ and have you read through some of the articles on it?
[01:18:40] <ro-bot-o> [url] VHEMT | www.vhemt.org
[01:18:41] *** Joins: time-trav (~mzt@gateway/tor-sasl/mzt)
[01:19:06] <dTal> Well, I don't care about those humans as much, it's true. But there are reasons for them to exist, nonetheless - they participate in a system that produces a lot of creativity and love etc, even if they don't directly do so themselves.
[01:19:28] <xx> if you don't care about those humans as much, then it is not your preference that 'humans should exist' but something else
[01:19:34] <dTal> Also, I think humans who don't express *any* of my values are surpassingly rare.
[01:19:38] <xx> and that something else should be identified and stated as preference
[01:20:05] <dTal> You're right, and I did, as best as I could.
[01:20:10] <xx> a blanket answer that says "because they are human" is no answer at all in my opinion
[01:20:33] <krb> long before the sun explodes the sun will evaporate the surface and all traces of humans
[01:20:46] <krb> *surface of earth
[01:20:46] <dTal> But I didn't say that, I did express my values, and I know you understood me because you said "what about the humans that don't express those traits"
[01:22:32] <dTal> Why is the vluntary human extinction movement voluntary?
[01:22:57] <Delf> Hello dTal
[01:23:03] <xx> because they'd get shut down pretty quickly if they said involuntary
[01:23:07] * dTal waves at Delf
[01:23:42] <dTal> So they don't actually believe in "voluntary" extinction? It's just a ruse?
[01:24:12] <dTal> As in, the voluntary part is utilitarian, and not a core value?

[01:25:59] <xx> oh they do believe in it being voluntary, I'm just pointing out that the word 'voluntary' has to be included there, because otherwise they would get very quickly banned out of existence

[01:27:14] <dTal> Right, but it's a pretty important distinction. If every member of the so-called Voluntary Human Extinction Movement had a button that would immediately eradicate all human life, would none of them push it?
[01:27:29] <xx> it's not really a membership thing
[01:27:45] <dTal> That is the difference between an intrinsic value and a utilitarian value.
[01:27:57] <mrdata> would i push that button?
[01:28:10] <mrdata> you know, it would be so tempting
[01:28:17] <xx> well take any random subset of humans, and I can guarantee someone would push that button
[01:29:11] <xx> so it seems to be an irrelevant point for vhemt if people who are not vhemt would also push that button
[01:29:12] <mrdata> it is a much easier thing if, instead of killing everyone the button simply made them infertile
[01:29:21] <dTal> mrdata: why?
[01:29:39] <xx> dTal: because there's no loss of anything that currently exists
[01:29:58] <dTal> There most certainly is. A future exists. Hope exist.
[01:30:06] <xx> future literally doesn't exist
[01:30:09] <xx> future *will* exist
[01:30:16] <mrdata> so lets make that button only make the presser infertile
[01:30:28] <xx> present exists
[01:30:32] <mrdata> becauser this is 'voluntary'
[01:30:47] <dTal> xx, you're playing semantic games.
[01:30:57] <xx> semantics are important here, no?
[01:31:21] <mrdata> the button exists
[01:31:53] <dTal> Fine. If you can't handle the abstract - fertility exists.
[01:32:22] <mrdata> you can choose not to procreate
[01:32:26] <xx> fertility exists, and doesn't have to be used - nothing is lost

[01:34:11] <dTal> If I cut off your penis, and defended this by pointing out that you always had the option of never using it anyway, I doubt my argument would cut much ice.
[01:34:18] * xx has no penis
[01:34:23] <mrdata> not so much a loss as, tidying up
[01:34:37] <mrdata> do you need to leave all doors open?
[01:34:59] <dTal> Fine. I poke your eyes out. You could always have kept them shut anyway.
[01:35:16] <mrdata> but we're talking voluntary
[01:35:22] <mrdata> so i choose not to look at that UFO
[01:35:32] <mrdata> because i believe they dont exist
[01:36:00] <xx> dTal: becoming infertile from one day to another changes nothing. Becoming blind changes everything.
[01:36:06] <dTal> Well, you're talking voluntary mrdata. We've got a bit sidetracked into why making everyone infertile is preferable to simply killing everyone outright.
[01:36:32] <mrdata> dTal, covid is making people infertile, they say
[01:36:45] <dTal> I postulate the real reason is that most humans find killing inherently squeamish, not any principled reason.
[01:37:06] <xx> I'd say most humans are perfectly fine with killing
[01:37:15] <dTal> You'd say wrong.

[01:38:32] <dTal> time-trav: Good question. What's the goal of anything? It depends on the person.
[01:38:44] <xx> dTal: it is an important distinction. What is it about humans that makes it not ok for you to kill them, compared to killing animals?
[01:38:59] <dTal> For my part, I'm trying to ascertain what xx's goals are.
[01:39:29] <xx> if you want me to express a goal, then that goal would be to let people know that there's an alternative to the perpetual breeding of humans
[01:39:51] <dTal> Why do you express a preference for no humans?
[01:40:15] <Delf> Less humans, not no humans
[01:40:47] <dTal> "Extinction" sounds pretty no-humans to me!
[01:40:55] <mrdata> let's say my disgust for humanity is really limited to how easily people believe false information

[01:56:00] <dTal> Well, I think that's factually wrong, but frankly I'm more interested in the philosophical part here. We can argue about facts when we've agreed on goals. You can't get an ought from an is.
[01:56:36] <xx> let's pose the hypothetical that 90% of people are capable of suffering. 90% of 1 million is much less suffering in the world than 90% of 1 billion.
[01:56:37] <time-trav> There certainly are ways to reach further back, but intuitively I would say it's prudent (and sufficient for colloquial purposes) to think that the pandemic is the main root cause for the chip shortage.
[01:56:45] <dTal> Why is "improving lives" important, while "alleviatiing suffering" is not? This is a most perplexing and alien viewpoint to me.
[01:57:08] <ProfSimm> dTal: we can alleviate suffering by ending all lives
[01:57:19] <xx> indeed that ends all suffering
[01:57:56] <dTal> But xx doesn't care about suffering one way or the other.
[01:58:16] <xx> dTal: you do though, and I'm saying that no more people = no more suffering
[01:58:26] <dTal> No, I'm not arguing that.
[01:58:39] <xx> so you don't care about suffering either then?
[01:59:32] <xx> the "improving lives" isn't even the goal in my opinion, the goal is voluntary human extinction. The "improving lives" comes as a side effect of it.
[02:00:03] <dTal> wait what
[02:00:09] <ProfSimm> Suffering is two kinds. Productive and non-productive. We don't want to end all suffering, as all personal and social growth happens through productive suffering. We want to eliminate however pointless suffering.
[02:00:35] <dTal> The only reason we're talking about improving lives is *because* you cited is as a goal of human extinction.

[02:00:46] <dTal> You've just contradicted yourself.
[02:01:16] <dTal> Now you're saying that human extinction *is* the goal, and improving lives is a big red herring we shouldn't even be talking about.

[02:37:37] <Delf> Perhaps, someday we can explain it scientifically
[02:38:44] <xx> just genetics I guess
[02:38:48] <biys> so here's something
[02:38:56] <biys> something that's bugging me
[02:39:17] <biys> i tend to think people go about their day with very little consideration of anyone else other than themselves
[02:39:32] <biys> i also think that with age comes a certain idea of seniority
[02:39:45] <biys> where a person, just because they're old, has some kidn of divine fucking understanding into the world
[02:40:04] <biys> don't get me wrong, i'm not suggesting peopel can't/aren't accomplished
[02:40:06] <Delf> They probably do...
[02:40:13] <xx> statistically an older person is more likely to have experienced more
[02:40:30] <biys> yes, but i wouldn't say that equates to understanding of the world
[02:40:41] <xx> doesn't equate, but likely correlates
[02:40:45] <biys> what did they do with the information?  how much further did they progress as a result of it?
[02:40:55] <Delf> To be older is to have more experience, by the fucking powers of the divine
[02:40:55] <biys> are their experiences valuable?
[02:41:07] <xx> biys: that part is individual
[02:41:14] <biys> i wouldn't say that there's some kind of inherent BENEFIT to this knowledge simply as a result of age
[02:41:36] <biys> does the point i'm making make sense?  cause i have a second part to this
[02:41:44] <Delf> Some are toooooooooooooo fucking busy with things in order to contemplate the experiences they've had
[02:41:46] <biys> i just wanna make sure you understand what i'm saying before we progress
[02:42:20] <biys> sure.  i mean... i've read poor bashing by jean swanson
[02:42:38] <biys> i understand that if you're marginalized to some extent, your "concerns" are likely burried within the supposed "trivial"
[02:42:56] <xx> you're saying that just because someone is old, it doesn't prove that they are more knowledgeable, and even if they were it doesn't prove that their knowledge is useful
[02:43:06] <biys> yes

[02:43:12] <xx> which is true, there's no guarantee of those things
[02:43:21] <biys> why for do we...
[02:43:25] <xx> but on a population level, older people probably know more than infants
[02:43:28] <biys> i'mma carry on for a second, beg your pardon
[02:43:30] <Delf> Elapsed time itself will not cut it
[02:43:44] <biys> so seniority within a business does account for SOMETHING
[02:43:51] <biys> "janet has been here for 30 years, don't fuck with her"
[02:44:02] <biys> why?
[02:44:05] <biys> i mean...
[02:44:07] <xx> probably because janet knows enough to bring the company down
[02:44:11] <biys> HAH
[02:44:13] <biys> fair enough
[02:44:14] <biys> touche
[02:44:30] <xx> stay anywhere long enough and you'll learn how to completely destroy that place
[02:44:53] <biys> i'm amazed that the heirarchy within business is based on "ass in the seat time"
[02:45:00] <biys> instead of the benefits a person can bring
[02:45:05] <xx> I'm not surprised
[02:45:23] <ProfSimm> biys we are what we (can) measure
[02:45:27] <xx> a lot of it can be that they've proven themselves that they don't destroy the company despite having the knowledge how to destroy the company
[02:45:39] <biys> ProfSimm: i work in a metric oriented environment
[02:45:48] <xx> that's why we trust russia/usa/china more with having nukes than by north korea or iran having nukes
[02:46:15] <ProfSimm> biys: in fact all reality is metric oriented. "oh you multiplied more in time? you win"
[02:46:34] <biys> so stop trying to stand on peoples heads
[02:46:36] <ProfSimm> biys: natural selection doesn't care how smart or cute you are
[02:46:51] <biys> it's a weak argument given we function within a system that operates... differently
[02:47:02] <biys> i'm not going to sabatoge myself for some ideal not based in reality
[02:47:20] <ProfSimm> biys: what ideal
[02:47:38] <biys> what point were you trying to make?
[02:47:43] <biys> beg your pardon, i might have jumped the gun
[02:47:57] <ProfSimm> None whatsoever
[02:48:07] <biys> i jumped the gun then, sorry
[02:48:17] <xx> biys: are you in a position now where you have some stupid people above you, despite you being superior to them? Start your own company, you'll have seniority there above everyone else (and a bunch of people below you who'll think you're stupid)
[02:48:29] <biys> oh for sure!
[02:48:31] <biys> i get that
[02:48:39] <biys> that isn't really the point i'm tryign to make
[02:48:44] <biys> okay ... so lemme finish
[02:48:46] <biys> one last second
[02:48:57] <ProfSimm> biys: maybe my point is that reality trying to figure out what it wants to be is a stubbornly flawed process based on metrics
[02:49:00] <biys> these epople, with seniority, actually hold, within themselves, some idea that they're superior in some regard
[02:49:24] <ProfSimm> Reality watching itself
[02:49:53] <biys> what it wants to be
[02:49:54] <biys> reality
[02:50:02] <xx> biys: on a population level, they probably are. But that means nothing for the individual level.
[02:50:04] <biys> "what it wants to b e"
[02:50:37] <biys> so their over-inflated sense of self ALSO seems to cause some affect or another on those around them
[02:50:48] <biys> where in... they ``might'' be allowed to drop the ball in soem form or anotehr
[02:50:51] <biys> on a regular basis
[02:51:02] <biys> and those with less tenure at the establishment are expected to pick up their slack

[02:51:28] <biys> i want no involvement with them
[02:51:32] <biys> yet i'm dragged into their world
