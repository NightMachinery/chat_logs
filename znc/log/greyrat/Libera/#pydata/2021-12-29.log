[00:24:15] <mefistofeles> Arrinao: hahaha no worries :)
[00:24:35] <mefistofeles> and yes, it's not that clear/intuitive, pandas is very powerful but he API has its rough edges
[00:26:18] <Arrinao> yeah, especially the error messages are very confusing
[00:27:40] <Arrinao> anyway I've come across one more thing that I'd like to ask about
[00:27:45] <Arrinao> date_format parameter
[00:28:31] <Arrinao> I don't really get what's that for, initially I thought it's for the very thing I asked about here first - i.e. the output, but it doesn't seem to work
[00:29:30] <Arrinao> (to clarify it's 'date_format' not just 'format')
[00:29:32] <mefistofeles> ah, where's that one from?
[00:30:00] <Arrinao> .to_csv() for example
[00:30:15] <Arrinao> I think it's for .to_json() and others too, but I'm not sure there
[00:30:17] <mefistofeles> ah okay, when exporting data, that works
[00:30:35] <mefistofeles> but since to_datetime is not really exporting, just returning objects 
[00:32:37] <Arrinao> ah right, looks like I'm mixing up stuff here
[00:33:13] <Arrinao> I was searching for .to_datetime() stuff and found a random stackoverflow thread
[00:35:06] <Arrinao> Just to know how it works - it finds a datetime column and formats it's contents?
[00:35:31] <Arrinao> for the target output ? (like .csv or .json file)
[00:36:22] <Arrinao> I find it weird that you don't specify the column yourself 
[00:40:26] <Arrinao> cancel that, I've just teseted this myself

[23:58:36] <Arrinao> hello
[23:58:54] <Arrinao> how do I get read_json() to not read datetime as a big number?
[23:59:03] <Arrinao>    year  day  month          DOB
[23:59:03] <Arrinao> 0  2010   15     10  1287100800000
[23:59:49] <Arrinao> convert_dates argument doesn't seem to work
