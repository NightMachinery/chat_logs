[01:47:08] <FIlystyn> after further investigation
[01:47:34] <FIlystyn> tho not sure how much this can be said to be debian at fault
[01:47:52] <FIlystyn> since it's system macros being kind of broken
[01:48:26] * at0m rolls the drums for the actual question
[01:48:33] <ede> 7 lines without actual info
[01:48:39] <at0m> :D
[01:48:42] <FIlystyn> I have this kind of problem - posix code uses  EAI_NODATA
[01:49:00] <rawtaz> ede: thats never a problem for those of us that can only count to 1 or 2 :)
[01:49:01] <FIlystyn> When I compile of with flag for use posix i get no macro
[01:49:19] <ede> rawtaz: 0 or 1 you mean ;)
[01:49:24] <FIlystyn> Not defined,
[01:49:27] <Pokey> Hey #debian, is there a build process I can replicate for the netinstall ISOs?
[01:49:39] <FIlystyn> So i go to source netdb.h
[01:49:48] <FIlystyn> And my macro is incide _USE_GNU
[01:49:59] <rawtaz> ede: much better, yeah! ;D
[01:50:30] <at0m> Pokey: like to preseed?
[01:50:33] <at0m> !preseed
[01:50:33] <dpkg> [preseed] Preseeding provides a way to set answers to questions asked during the Debian installation process, to allow for a streamlined or completely automated installation.  The <install guide> provides an extensive appendix on preseeding with a full example.  See http://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Preseed and http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/394 .  See also <debconf-set-selections>.
[01:51:07] <Pokey> at0m: Preseed isn't enough, no
[01:51:09] <FIlystyn> it is inside #ifdef the gnu thing
[01:51:13] <FIlystyn> this shoudl be clear now
[01:51:14] <Pokey> the NetInst ISO doesn't appear to allow EFI
[01:51:22] <at0m> Pokey: hmm upon more reading, probably not indeed
[01:51:33] <Pokey> I have my preseed working fine, but getting an EFI capable ISO is proving difficult
[01:51:54] <Pokey> I've asked in #grub but no response. Would you like me to paste my question from there, here?
[01:52:24] <pert> FIlystyn: you should read the feature_test_macros man page, but basically what you want to do is define _GNU_SOURCE to 1
[01:52:33] <FIlystyn> NOPE
[01:53:30] <FIlystyn> _GNU_CRAP is nonposix
[01:54:18] <ede> gnu is known to add a lot of their own ideas
[01:54:29] <FIlystyn> All I need is posix feature macro which I DO use.  + the header
[01:54:35] <FIlystyn> Again I am not using gnu code
[01:55:09] <pert> but EAI_NODATA is not in POSIX. if you want it, you have to enable including "the GNU crap"
[01:55:14] <ede> i found https://sites.uclouvain.be/SystInfo/usr/include/netdb.h.html after reading https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/netdb.h.html
[01:55:31] <FIlystyn> I am sorry NONAME

[05:50:42] <Khepra> Heston: nothing ridiculous about that. That mechanism allows you to override packaged unit either by adding additional Execs, or by first resetting with an empty ExecStart=   ; the same applies to all the params that are overrideable like that (cumulative).

[05:57:27] <blinux> Does Debian not have a swap partition/file by default? I've run htop and free -h and I see no swap at all. Also, a few times I've had my system lock up with constant disk access probably due to some swapping problem.
[05:59:22] <Khepra> blinux: the installer's automagic sets up swap, yes. if you do it manually, it even warns you if you proceed without swap.
[05:59:55] <Khepra> so the only way you don't have swap is if you did manual partitioning and ignored its warning, or used debootstrap. or you do have swap but it's off for some reason
[06:01:57] <blinux> I don't remember what I did, but I doubt I would ever tell it not to use swap. I think I may have used the calimares install image though.

[08:43:03] <sney> !calamares
[08:43:03] <dpkg> Starting in Debian 10 Buster, the Calamares installer is included in the debian-live boot images.  The normal installer is also included, in the first menu after boot.  Once in the live system look for an Install Debian icon, or type: 'sudo calamares'  https://github.com/calamares/calamares/wiki  https://jonathancarter.org/2019/10/17/calamares-plans-for-debian-11/  and  https://averagelinuxuser.com/debian-10-calamares/
[08:43:47] <sney> this system was installed with calamares. I do have a swap partition, but I didn't just click next through the menus, and it was some months ago so I can't remember if I had to explicitly select swap
[08:44:08] <sney> the swap size is 3.8G though, and that sounds automatic-ish
[08:44:52] <blinux> sney: Yeah, I can't remember what I did either. I don't think I would have not added a swap, but not sure. I did double the size which is probably more than needed, but I have way more HDD space than I need and not enough RAM and I don't want to have the PC lock up again.

[08:52:25] <sney> maybe you can confirm that if you have some SoC on your network that you can have monitor resource usage externally?
[08:52:28] <blinux> It was trying I think, but there was no swap space setup/enabled. Nothing could move really.
[08:52:39] <sney> but if you're running out of memory there's only so many things that can happen
[08:52:57] <blinux> I didn't check htop from the other tty, forgot to.
[08:53:10] <blinux> But, I created the swap and set it up, so I think it won't happen again.

[14:28:52] <dreamon> Aarch64debian, sorry I know here are technical specialists.. your my last hope.
[14:28:52] <at0m> dreamon: maybe look into adb. but access from $computer is something you have to enable from the device _before_ that, unsure you can still enable that now..
[14:29:40] <at0m> touch is something kde-connect could provide, also, if you enabled that before
[14:30:17] <dreamon> at0m, sorry. not enabled..
[14:30:18] <at0m> looks like you're in for a screen replacement
[14:30:45] <at0m> maybe you can connect a USB mouse the USB port
[14:31:20] <at0m> for example my phone came with an adapter to connect external usb devices..
[14:31:48] <dreamon> I already did. but its disable in menu. I have same handy twice and look in there.. it is only recognized if I enable Option manually for 10minutes

[15:02:23] <jelly> willow, it's usually faster to set up a chroot for i386, the amd64 kernel supports 32bit userspace
[15:02:30] <jelly> !debootstrap
[15:02:30] <dpkg> debootstrap can create a basic Debian system from scratch, without apt/dpkg.  Useful for installing in a <chroot>. It is key to installing Debian GNU/Linux from a Unix/Linux system. http://wiki.debian.org/Debootstrap - https://www.debian.org/releases/bullseye/amd64/apds03.en.html

[15:03:03] <jelly> what was that other thing
[15:03:04] <jelly> !sbuild
[15:03:05] <dpkg> somebody said sbuild was The 'sbuild' package provides a way to build Debian packages within <chroot> environments that are managed using the <schroot> utility. Building within sbuild saves installing the build-dependencies on your machine and also compiles in a clean environment; sbuild is used on the Debian <buildd> network. See https://wiki.debian.org/sbuild. An alternative to sbuild is <pbuilder>.
[15:03:24] <jelly> !pbuilder
[15:03:24] <dpkg> somebody said pbuilder was "personal package builder", a package which creates a chroot for building packages which are optionally targeted at releases other than the currently installed release. It is useful for checking that a package has the correct build-dependencies as well. apt-get install pbuilder && pager /usr/share/doc/pbuilder/README.Debian. An alternative to pbuilder is <sbuild>.

[18:46:46] <jelly> hiya, debian does not ship firefox release.  You'd have to use Mozilla's build somehow.  Flatpak or their tarball.

[18:47:25] <willow> i now prefer to install firefox from .tar.gz package over snap
[18:47:29] <jelly> hiya, you'll have to create a custom .desktop file for it as well
[18:47:41] *** Joins: pong (~beaver@user/pong)
[18:47:46] <hiya> custom .desktop? can you help me with it?
[18:47:47] <willow> .tar.gz version will update normally similar to windows version
[18:47:54] <hiya> nice :)
[18:48:18] <hiya> jelly: can we remove ESR?
[18:48:26] <hiya> I think it installs Chromium when we do so
[18:48:28] <hiya> right?
[18:49:04] <jelly> you probably have some metapackage that really wants a web browser installed

[18:49:59] <willow> the GTK_THEME=" " is to override firefox theme because i add gtk 3 css customizations (wider scrollbar mostly)
[18:50:05] <xx> .tar.gz version will only autoupdate if installed in a location that permits that
[18:50:18] <xx> and yes it is possible to remove firefox-esr from debian without installing chromium
[18:50:33] <jelly> basically it only autoupdates if it's running as the user that has write permissions there
[18:50:48] <willow> yes xx correct.  i usually put in /opt and chmod 777 /opt
[18:51:06] <xx> I'm surprised chromium still hasn't been removed from debian
[18:51:46] <jelly> willow, chmod 777 /opt is not a good idea.
[18:52:35] <jelly> I _think_ it's enough to make /opt/firefox and the contents owned by your user
[18:52:53] <willow> yeah i never know what to do with /opt and /usr/local/bin because i like my user to be able to write in both
[18:53:09] <willow> i could create a group or chgrp to staff or something
[18:53:35] <ede> jelly: does the firefox flatpack have *any* advantage over the tarball? (i know how to use tar(1)).
[18:53:53] <jelly> no idea, I have not tried the flatpak yet

[18:58:07] <jelly> hwdyki, which debian release do you have to see that file?
[18:58:33] <hwdyki> bullseye
[18:58:49] <jelly> I don't have it on Debian 11, hwdyki.  Do you mean sources.list ?
[18:59:21] <hwdyki> no it's the config file for apt-mirror. it's for creating mirrors of apt repos.
[18:59:47] <ede> for firefox it means opening the site (it checks itself, i'll have to find out how and script someting), youtube-dl has the date in the http redirect, yt-dlp doesn NOT iirc, everything does it own thing. a script with modules for the individual packages would be it i guess. then maybe to download it into another place then somewhere in $HOME as $USER.

[21:43:16] <judsmapp> Hi, I plugged in a FAT-32 USB drive in Windows where it was accused of being corrupt. I immediately took it away and went to check it under Debian. It doesn't show up in the file manager or via lsblk. dmesg logs advise me to run fsck in it, but the device doesn't show up under /dev. How can I run fsck in it in this case?
[21:43:56] <judsmapp> (fdisk -l doesn't show it either)
[21:44:18] <sney> so dmesg advises running fsck but then the device disappears?
[21:44:29] <sney> what is the exact message
[21:44:34] *** Joins: tieinv (~tieinv@user/tieinv)
[21:44:52] <judsmapp> just a sec gonna make a paste of it
[21:45:15] <Heston> judsmapp, your device definitely damaged, maybe bad solder joints on the connector
[21:45:42] <sney> that's likely but let's see the output
[21:45:43] <judsmapp> this is the dmesg output https://termbin.com/acnv
[21:46:19] <judsmapp> Heston: could be, but it was working right this moment, and I see no reason for a sudden failure
[21:46:38] <judsmapp> unless it was really well-masked under flash storage rot etc
[21:46:39] <sney> looks like an 8GB, is it old?
[21:47:04] <sney> flash drives are a time limited thing, eventually they are just done
[21:47:23] <judsmapp> yes, 8GB micro SD. Can't really say, definitely more than 4 years but hasn't much action until halfway through last year
[21:47:35] <Heston> sounds damaged*. I take it you didn't disconnect the drive at 5832.779100 but the system did that?
[21:47:39] <sney> oof, an sd card even, yeah that's toast
[21:47:49] <judsmapp> Heston: yes, something like that
[21:48:22] <sney> you could make sure that the contacts on your card reader are clean. or just test a different microsd card and see if the issue repeats
[21:48:23] <Heston> try different ports if you have them, another computer if you can
[21:48:26] <judsmapp> plugged in Windows, then worked for a bit, suddenly Windows spits it out. Upon reconnect, claims it's corrupted
[21:48:37] <sney> but given the response in windows, I doubt that sd card is coming back
[21:49:14] *** Joins: berkhan (~berkhan@159.146.42.222)
[21:49:16] <Heston> if it's intermittent, that would confirm a faulty electrical connection
[21:49:47] <Heston> well, not 100% but far more likely
[21:50:04] <judsmapp> ok, derpity werpity, changing the reader device rendered it 100% rw again
[21:50:28] <judsmapp> thanks for tips, though, I definitely should back up its data and use another flash drive
[21:51:00] <judsmapp> curious: how can I "check" the health of the device itself? Can something like gnome-disks perform an accurate assessment?

[21:53:13] <sney> I'm not sure what gnome-disks is capable. maybe? usually fsck and badblocks are your only option, and no most flash memory is not SMART capable

[21:56:42] <sney> yeah, kind of the same deal as the destructive r/w badblocks test. you might get an answer, but the test itself will accelerate the issue
[21:57:09] <willow> judsmapp: i often have issues with the microsd holders.  it seems like only 1 out of every 3 or 4 actually works
[21:57:46] <willow> contacts are always flaky.  try re-instering the microsd in the holder and the holder in the slot
[21:58:23] <Heston> bad to NES cartridges
[21:58:27] <Heston> back*
[21:59:14] * judsmapp has a sudden urge to blow/wet the card reader's contacts
[21:59:20] <sney> only worse because it's deliberately made as cheaply as possible. both the cards and readers.
[21:59:38] <sney> if you can reach the contacts with an alcohol wipe, that couldn't hurt
[21:59:38] <judsmapp> good ol' cartridge gaming era. All the way through the Game Boy
[22:00:16] <judsmapp> yeah, but I think I'll rather just use a proper USB pendrive instead, I sorta just picked up the nearest device I could find
[22:00:59] <sney> they do tend to be a little more robust
[22:01:47] * willow likes the kingston datatraveler exodia drives.  only $5 or so for the 32G ones direct from kingston
[22:02:34] <Heston> all my usb drives are kingston datatraveler, havent had an issue yet
[22:02:57] <willow> buy 10.  you'll be glad you did ;-)
[22:03:34] <sney> I just pick up whatever's in the 2-pack next to the checkout at e.g. staples. some of them are kingston but it's an assortment. I don't think there's a significant brand distinction with stuff like that
[22:03:54] <sney> kingston, sandisk, whatever, as long as it's not the bootleg counterfeit stuff that lies about the capacity
[22:04:27] <Heston> damn usb bootleg fireworks
[22:04:29] <sney> I do have a slight preference for the ones that are retractable, rather than having a separate cap to get lost
[22:05:38] * willow has a few datatraveler 100 g3 retractables as well ;-)

[22:59:28] <johnfg> Hi guys.  First time going to print since upgrading to Bullseye.

[23:03:32] <Heston> johnfg, yeah you have to get them from canon since they're non-free. I did the same recently but ran into problems since the driver .deb is old and requires libraries that aren't available for bullseye. Maybe you'll get lucky
[23:04:57] <Heston> rather than spend half a day finding a solution to that, I ran an older Ubuntu Livecd which happen to have the drivers preinstalled
[23:06:22] <johnfg> Heston: greycat: Thanks for your answer.  I'll try the driverless first.
[23:07:07] <Heston> scanning definitely worked driverless for me but not printing. Definitely curious to hear how it goes for you

And as such, I've now added another hard drive (split into the correct size partitions for the lvmraid4 stripe set). But - I'm not entirely sure how to correctly extend that RAID4 LV.
[23:41:22] <UrielCorinthian> I'm fairly sure I need to use lvconvert. Perhaps something like lvconvert --stripes 7 /dev/mapper/lvdatastripe /dev/sde1 /dev/sde2 /dev/sde3 /dev/sde4 where 7 is the new number of stripes (excluding the parity) and /dev/sdeN are the new PVs to be added
