[18:27:30] <nij-> rotateq: I just woke up again. Feel free.
[18:27:51] <nij-> beach: What would be a better data repn?
[18:28:13] <nij-> Plist is small and nice.. but I constantly find that data retrieval is kinda awkward.
[18:32:37] *** Quits: nexeq (~nexeq@user/nexeq) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[18:56:12] <beach> nij-: I have no idea what the problem is that you are trying to solve, so I have no recommendation.  But yes, this awkwardness looks like something is wrong.  Like if you had things in a standard object, you could use WITH-ACCESSORS.
[18:57:51] <beach> I guess you could create yourself a macro something like WITH-ACCESSORS but for plists.  That would at least avoid the code duplication. 
[18:58:35] <beach> ... as rotateq suggested.
[18:59:09] <beach> (with-plist-stuff ((w :w) (x :x) (y :y) (z :z)) plist ...)
[19:07:35] <beach> Though plists are error prone.  If there is not value with the indicator given, NIL (or some explicit default that you give) is returned.  To avoid problems, you would need to give a unique default other than NIL and then check that this default is not returned.  
[19:08:37] <beach> If you don't do this, the default value (usually NIL) risk getting propagated further in your computation, and you will have mysterious bugs to find because NIL was given as some argument rather than a more specific object.
[19:09:28] <beach> If you have a standard object, you will get an immediate error if the accessor is not applicable to the object, or if the slot is uninitialized.
[19:11:02] <nij-> The problem I'm trying to solve: I have a function that does the heavy-calculation. At the end, it should give four objects.
[19:11:33] <nij-> I arrange the four objects into a plist (:a obj1 :b obj2 :c obj3 :d obj4).
[19:11:43] <beach> Then multiple values is a better alternative. 
[19:11:48] <nij-> And whenever other function needs the value, I have to unwind it.
[19:12:22] <nij-> a b c d sort of have meanings.. so I reckon it's better to leave their names to them.
[19:14:55] <beach> OK, then how about (apply (lambda (&key a b c d) ...) plist)?
[19:15:29] <beach> You can easily wrap that in a macro.
[19:24:43] <beach> nij-: Are you still there?
