[08:00:17] <shrysr> Hey R wizards - is there some standard way to batch process a SQL queries with a large number of... items?  Like >>  select contactid, email from foo where email in ('blah@xxx.com', 'blah2@xxx.com' ....)   and I have a varying number of emails from 2k-1M depending case to case.  I have just been using a loop with slices. I've been needing it in different projects and was wondering if there is a better way. It seems like a fairly common thing ppl need...
[08:01:01] <shrysr> in terms of not overloading the db. 
[08:28:50] <rickyrick> You mean not sending one big IN clause with 1 million entries?
[08:29:05] <rickyrick> Maybe just dump to a temp table and join on that
[08:33:39] *** Quits: redrum88 (~redrum88@user/redrum88) (Quit: Going offline, see ya! (www.adiirc.com))
[08:44:53] <shrysr> yes rickyrick thats what i mean
[08:45:27] <shrysr> nuffin in dplyr / R ? What are the caveats of a temp table. Never used one before.
[08:47:41] <rickyrick> >caveats
[08:47:46] <rickyrick> You gotta have the permissions to create such a table
[08:48:17] <rickyrick> On the other hand I don't think there's anything wrong with just sending a massive SELECT query
[08:48:28] <rickyrick> By doing it all at once you can let the query planner figure out the best execution plan
[08:58:48] <shrysr> Hmm. The thing is it sometimes takes very long, as long as 20 minutes, even though i think most of the join columns are indexed. Sometimes errors out as well for invalid emails which are then filtered out / cleaned etc. I prefer the batched approach and it would be useful to control the number of emails fed in. I do find the massive query to be any faster.
[08:59:06] <shrysr> i do NOT**
[08:59:14] <shrysr> find the massive query to be any faster. 
[08:59:17] <shrysr> than the batched query. 
[09:00:14] <shrysr> Creating a table is np. 
[09:12:26] <rickyrick> I guess then just dump the emails into the table
[09:12:31] <rickyrick> Then do a join
[09:12:59] <rickyrick> I guess if you're on an older MySQL or something it'd struggle with IN (large list of values)
[09:13:20] <rickyrick> I sometimes use a common table expression in PostgreSQL to hold the values
[09:13:51] <rickyrick> Otherwise just write a wrapper function that does the batch query for you :^)
[09:15:03] <shrysr> Yep, I am writing a function. the problem seemed to be that... it wasnt adapting well to different situations.. which seems weird as i type it. I'ma  work on it.  I found some articles on temp tables. Will read on up Postgres. 
[09:17:18] <rickyrick> I guess the better question is which DB are you already using
[09:18:46] <shrysr> MySQL
[09:19:01] <shrysr> prolly older version
[09:19:36] <rickyrick> 5.x?
[09:22:22] <shrysr> 5.7
[09:22:29] <shrysr> yep
[09:22:35] * rickyrick vomits
[09:22:41] <shrysr> LOL
[09:22:52] * rickyrick diarrheas too
[09:23:02] <rickyrick> Probably time to upgrade :^)
[09:23:14] * shrysr not responsible for it. And ... looking for job. :)
[09:23:21] <shrysr> new job *
[09:24:23] <shrysr> Temp table still the way to go?
[09:25:18] <rickyrick> Probably yeah
[09:25:27] <shrysr> rickyrick: its weird, but where I $work.. i have found some .. er pertinent questions and .. options are ignored. 
[09:25:33] <rickyrick> create temporary table etc etc
[09:25:41] <rickyrick> I assume there's no official DB admin
[09:25:52] <shrysr> so not much hope in asking anyway. I try to process as much as possible in memory... Prefer hacking in R> 
[09:26:00] <shrysr> There is an admin.. 
[09:26:11] <rickyrick> lol?
[09:26:18] <rickyrick> Are the front-end guys pretending they can run back-end
[09:26:38] <shrysr> we are... working on a new platform/ app... v2. That is on AWS. and fairly... probably.. significantly better. I work on that db too. But those are shiny dashboards. 
[09:27:06] <rickyrick> I guess such is corporate code
[09:28:44] <shrysr> No.. these guys.. idk. Maybe they dont wanna care about the older app and db for now since it will be shifted later. But all clients on the older app now, and reports/requests etc is in the .. now.  There is an architect, and a top 'VP'.. both between them have written most of the codebase in Java. An admin whoz the go to for all this stuff exists. and some of it out sourced. Its .. complicated. 
[09:30:33] <shrysr> And... they write TONNES of code. Well Java is verbose. but it Appears erm largely written in.. clever ways. But maybe idk wtf i am talking about. I mean to say they appear talented programmers who solve problems fast... many that I have nfi about. 
[09:33:16] <rickyrick> Yeah that makes sense
[09:33:30] <shrysr> So no.. they can create + run backend for sure. Thats where it doesnt make sense - why older db version. The main app per my shiny explorations, serves atleast 400 unique logins a day... and prolly several 100k emails sent out a day (marketing campaigns, etc) with webforms and all kindsa shit. Sure, it does crash.. reasonably frequently.. but is brought back up by them. Sometimes yours truly helps.  But tis ugly.. i dont really like it at all. 
[09:33:31] <rickyrick> Just sunset it and pretend it never existed
[09:33:50] <shrysr> i meant interface. 
[09:33:56] <shrysr> aye
[09:34:44] <shrysr> LORD its 10. but i enjoyed talking rickyrick and thank thee for your patience! 
[09:34:53] <shrysr> and advice. 
[09:34:55] <shrysr> and farts
[09:35:17] <shrysr> and diaoerheaa ... i could never reliably spell that. 
[09:35:57] <rickyrick> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

[21:02:55] <Bayes> ok smarthats here's one for you
[21:03:24] * rickyrick farts
[21:03:33] <Bayes> I've just been on a meeting: out of 10 people, 7 wore glasses and 3 didnt. Additionally, 2 wore masks, the rest didn't. There were 2 people with glasses and mask on.
[21:03:41] <Bayes> DO MASK CAUSE EYESIGHT PROBLEMS?
[21:03:49] <Bayes> masks*
[21:04:07] <Bayes> also, what's the probability that I was wearing glasses and a mask
[21:05:13] <rickyrick> Take another sample of 10 people until you get the results you want
[21:05:43] <Bayes> lmao
[21:06:16] <Bayes> one scientist was basically saying they were doing that
[21:06:38] <rickyrick> Sounds like applied stats to me
[21:06:40] <Bayes> and the other statistician in the room was like putting his hands on the ears and straining the eyes
[21:06:40] <Bayes> lmao
[21:07:06] <Bayes> cause they found something interest in one experiment one, and they wanted to replicate it many times across the years without luck
[21:07:21] <Bayes> sounds like real life to me
[21:07:33] <rickyrick> Yep
[21:07:53] <Bayes> man so disappointing
[21:08:32] <Bayes> imagine a social network where scientists can up/downvote on colleagues
[21:08:49] <rickyrick> There is, except you can only upvote
[21:08:49] <Bayes> "this guy was openly telling us in one meeting how he went about p-hacking" -1
[21:08:51] <rickyrick> It's called citations
[21:08:57] <rickyrick> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[21:09:11] <Bayes> have you heard of open reviews?
[21:09:29] <Bayes> the kind of things that sound fun but will never fly
[21:10:21] <rickyrick> You mean the equivalent of youtube comments for pubs?
[21:10:38] <Bayes> but with your actual name and affiliation
[21:10:44] <Bayes> like, a real witch hunt
[21:10:48] <rickyrick> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[21:12:23] <Bayes> at least it'd make this job super fun
[21:12:27] <Bayes> let's agree on that
[21:12:47] <Bayes> and also it'd make a nice sci fi plot
[21:12:58] <Bayes> like The Witcher's the wild hunt, but with androids and scientists
[21:18:06] <Bayes> also
[21:18:46] <Bayes> it's interesting how some languages pick * to mean dot product and another similar syntax for the elementwise product
[21:18:55] <Bayes> but others pick the converse
[21:19:51] <Bayes> it's like we can't agree on what is the main multiplication methods
[21:20:52] <Bayes> I'm so full of illuminating thoughts today
[21:21:05] <Bayes> great food for thought
[21:23:10] <rickyrick> I just can't get over the use of ** for exponentiation in Python lol
[21:30:01] <confuzeus> that works in R too!
[21:30:52] <rickyrick> Yeah but you don't have to use it
[21:30:55] <rickyrick> :**)
[21:31:06] <confuzeus> true
[21:37:45] <Bayes> rickyrick that's a really hard one to swallow yup
[21:38:05] <shrysr> rickyrick farts in case it helps swallowing
[21:40:52] <Bayes> also, another very illuminating thought from this highly critical brain
[21:41:10] <Bayes> am I the only one who wishes that papers would include line numbers?
[21:41:50] <Bayes> so you can simply reference a line number for anything that has not been explicitly numbered by the author?
[21:42:07] <rickyrick> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[21:43:46] <Bayes> is there a 4chan for stats, data science, whatev?
[21:43:55] *** Joins: ProfSimm (~ProfSimm@176-12-60-137.pon.spectrumnet.bg)
[21:44:00] <rickyrick> lmao
[21:44:02] <rickyrick> I don't think so
[21:44:27] <Bayes> funny, given that this field is full of creeps
[21:44:27] <rickyrick> https://boards.4channel.org/sci/thread/14278377
[21:44:46] <Bayes> I hope you have vpn at work rickyrick lmao
[21:44:54] <rickyrick> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[21:45:03] <rickyrick> good luck i'm behind seven proxies
[21:45:25] <Bayes> imagine getting your tenure package rejected: "traces of 4chan in browsing history"
[21:46:41] <confuzeus>      
[21:47:04] <rickyrick> I don't have to imagine
[21:47:07] <rickyrick> :^)
[21:47:44] <Bayes> the tenured old fart spoke
[21:48:06] <Bayes> also something that we need, is a way to Ctrl+F pdfs for greeks and symbols
[21:48:22] <rickyrick> Works for me
[21:48:40] <Bayes> let alone that awesome project on github that autoreferences symbols with definitions
[21:48:53] <Bayes> hope they keep working on that cause that's the ultimate paper reader
[21:48:59] <rickyrick> https://i.ibb.co/y45TZ92/t-CD38-Fh-VZEYCof4-Ae-Ae-V.png
[21:49:14] <Bayes> what reader is that friend
[21:49:22] <rickyrick> Just SumatraPDF
[21:50:05] <rickyrick> I just have an AutoHotkey script that lets me input greek letters easily
[21:51:19] <Bayes> ah true, it works for me too https://i.imgur.com/exTENBa.png
[21:51:34] <Bayes> just need to set up compose key once and for all
[21:51:45] <rickyrick> Yep
[21:51:59] <Bayes> what do you use as mod key for greeks?
[21:52:13] <rickyrick> RCtrl+G, followed by a letter
[21:52:27] <Bayes> k
[21:52:37] <rickyrick> I copied the keylist off scientific workplace 5.5
[21:52:40] <rickyrick> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[21:53:04] <rickyrick> RCtrl+B, letter gives me the blackboard bold version
[21:53:05] <rickyrick> Works gr8
[21:53:09] <rickyrick> ℝ
[21:53:26] <Bayes> do you luatex with unicodes as well?
[21:53:46] <Bayes> I think we already had this convo nevermind
[21:53:48] <rickyrick> Not yet, considering switching
[21:53:49] <rickyrick> :^)
[21:54:06] <rickyrick> Just have to swap out pdflatex as the compiler though
[21:54:21] <Bayes> yeah I swapped pdflatex -> luatex no problem
[21:54:26] <Bayes> like, literally no change at all
[21:54:49] <rickyrick> The only part that I haven't gotten to work the same is with \tikzexternalize
[21:55:29] <Bayes> do you dags a lot that you need to externalize tikz?
[21:55:53] <rickyrick> I dump ggplots to tikz
[21:56:03] <Bayes> oh my
[22:01:51] <confuzeus> see https://www.outreachy.org/communities/cfp/the-r-project-for-statistical-computing/ for those wanting to learn R or get help on some project
[22:02:33] <confuzeus> just got the email on r-devel
[22:03:19] <rickyrick> neat

[22:15:01] <Bayes> I feel like this algo shoulda been written in terms of i from 2:n https://i.imgur.com/F4qazT3.png
[22:15:06] <Bayes> and I fear I might be missing something
[22:15:56] <Bayes> fendur I see your point, but I'm gonna put equal chance on advisers erring more than students
[22:16:28] <Bayes> especially given how little focus they seem to put on their work on average
[22:16:31] <fendur> lol. awful lot of i+1
[22:16:54] <Bayes> yeah that's my point, if you're using i+1 everywhere just shift the index
[22:17:02] <Bayes> I'm sure it was just oversight
[22:17:14] <fendur> that was the first iteration of the code
[22:17:34] <Bayes> and probably getting burned out right before submitting the manuscript, as it happens
[22:17:36] <fendur> the meta algo failed to make it to iteration 2
[22:18:29] <Bayes> anyway I should stop commenting on others work until my implementation works as intended at least lol
[22:19:50] <rickyrick> Since when was pseudocode just R code lmao

[22:22:51] <Bayes> yeah that was my thought too
[22:22:56] <Bayes> but I'm gonna show you algo 3
[22:23:24] <Bayes> https://i.imgur.com/Ee4mpWe.png that's even... more fun
[22:24:36] <rickyrick> Uh
[22:24:37] <rickyrick> Lol?
[22:25:00] <rickyrick> I feel like the only thing that was changes was %*% to dot()
[22:26:30] <confuzeus> that looks like a statistics phd so focused on the end goal or graduation?
[22:27:31] <confuzeus> and hasn't encountered programming yet
[22:46:04] <Bayes> no
[22:46:11] <Bayes> I mean ot
[22:46:30] <Bayes> I mean it's not cool to call out people for their work
[22:46:49] <Bayes> but it's what you'd consider a good paper by what you'd consider a good professor with 10 years in
[22:47:46] <Bayes> we don't all have the same strengths, so while in this case it's the pseucode, I'm sure on my work somebody could comment on many other things that don't favor me
[23:10:31] <CuriousErnestBro> confuzeus looks similar to gsoc
[23:16:26] <confuzeus> Bayes: you should bs when you see it. it does not change anything
[23:19:30] <confuzeus> CuriousErnestBro: ya
[23:21:57] <CuriousErnestBro> confuzeus you wanna pay me to do R work?
[23:22:19] <CuriousErnestBro> :D
[23:24:26] <confuzeus> lol. we use lots of uni students but only for data capturing or sometimes data cleaning. i think if your R skills are decent you can also mentor someone!
[23:25:05] <CuriousErnestBro> i'm a student
[23:25:14] <CuriousErnestBro> now my prof is really good at R
[23:25:32] <CuriousErnestBro> btw how do I check whether a number is in confint(model)[2,]
[23:31:22] <confuzeus> without comparing it with lcl and ucl? i don't know
[23:37:01] <CuriousErnestBro> yeah i did: if (confint(post.lasso)[2,1] <= beta[1] && beta[1] <= confint(post.lasso)[2,2])
[23:37:44] <CuriousErnestBro> would be nice to have |> is_contained(beta[1])

[23:49:10] <rickyrick> CuriousErnestBro: Here's an ugly hack: (prod(sign(confint - x)) < 0)
[23:49:38] <rickyrick> :^)
[23:49:55] <CuriousErnestBro> very ugly
[23:49:57] <CuriousErnestBro> i like it
[23:50:05] <rickyrick> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[23:50:20] <CuriousErnestBro> obfuscating code makes me look smart
[23:50:22] <CuriousErnestBro>  /s
[23:51:32] <CuriousErnestBro> rickyrick my poor macbook :(
[23:51:40] <CuriousErnestBro> the prof makes us run simulation studies 
[23:52:35] <rickyrick> School doesn't provide compute resources?
[23:53:27] <CuriousErnestBro> no
[23:53:36] <rickyrick> RIP
[23:53:37] <CuriousErnestBro> well they give you a vmware remote desktop 
[23:53:39] <rickyrick> Time to learn Rcpp
[23:53:41] <rickyrick> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[23:53:45] <CuriousErnestBro> but i'm not trying to get any more gray hairs
[23:53:53] <rickyrick> sux2bu
[23:54:18] <CuriousErnestBro> i should email the prof asking about compute resources and mention "my poor macbook"
