[00:07:47] <zen_coder> python venv is creating following directory: "/lib/python3.6/site-packages" where the modules are installed. can I change this to something generic like: "lib/modules" ?

[00:08:13] <grym> zen_coder: and, you shouldn't have to ever care
[00:08:19] <zen_coder> I have to
[00:08:25] <grym> i very much doubt it
[00:08:35] <zen_coder> I will set the PYTHON_PATH to this folder
[00:08:38] <grym> no
[00:08:58] <zen_coder> and I need to retrieve this path somehow dynamically from the venv I have created
[00:08:59] <grym> you will thevenv/bin/python ... and then PYTHONPATH will take care of itself
[00:09:15] <zen_coder> it is a little complicated to explain why I am doing this

[10:15:26] <furrykef> It's a common programming idiom when making big changes to a file to write all the changes to a temporary file and then move it atomically to the original file's location. I'm surprised the tempfile module doesn't seem to have a convenient way to handle this
[10:16:16] <furrykef> I guess one would use tempfile.mkstemp and just handle the moving (or deletion if something goes wrong) manually

[10:26:26] <KirkMcDonald> You could also, say, include the pid in the filename.

[13:37:49] <goppo> i'm thinking of running a remote crawler that transfers the images downloaded to a local machine. does anyone know how the file transfer should be setup?
[13:38:06] <KirkMcDonald> rsync?
[13:38:39] <goppo> KirkMcDonald i'm trying to do the transfer on the fly because the crawler machine has a tiny hard disk

[13:40:32] *** Joins: ghost43 (~ghost43@gateway/tor-sasl/ghost43)
[13:40:38] <goppo> KirkMcDonald but if it's done via ssh, each connection would need to be authenticated and it'd be painfully slow for a crawler
[13:40:55] <goppo> it'll be getting around 20 images per sec

[20:00:26] <CrtxReavr> I was always taught to use a single _ just by convention for "private" methods. .
[20:00:33] <exarkun> The private convention is single _ prefix
[20:00:49] <CrtxReavr> But is this semi-enforcement by using double _s a newish thing?
[20:00:51] <grym> vladoski: ok, that sounds like a root validator
[20:00:55] <exarkun> Double _ prefix causes the name to be mangled in a fairly predictable way
[20:01:05] <exarkun> Some people will say this is to avoid name collisions in an inheritance hierarchy
[20:01:07] <grym> CrtxReavr: no, dunder mangling is very old
[20:01:19] <CrtxReavr> 2.x old, or even older?
[20:01:23] <exarkun> It's not about "enforcement"
[20:01:28] <grym> at least 2.x
[20:01:45] <exarkun> It's about A and B not accidentally stepping on each other's "_foo" when one is a subclass of the other
[20:01:46] <vladoski> grym https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/validators/ something like this?
[20:02:00] <exarkun> A more reliably way to avoid collisions is not to use inheritance, of course. :)

[23:29:05] <NeilRG> SnoopJ, how is allocation unnecessary?  you have to allocate either way.  I guess it just saves on storing the giant list

[23:30:06] <SnoopJ> NeilRG, I'm assuming you're doing stack() more than once during this program's lifetime. If so, and if the stacked data is relatively short-lived, re-using that allocation might be possible.
[23:30:41] <SnoopJ> If it's not short-lived, you're probably stuck allocating every time.

[23:52:08] <SnoopJ> yea, always nice when a library is aware of os.PathLike

[23:53:49] * SnoopJ does not care for /
[23:54:27] <bookworm> what do you do? I mean which field do you program in?
[23:54:34] * akk still uses os.path.join and os.posixpath.join quite a bit, maybe should switch those to use pathlib
[23:54:51] <SnoopJ> bookworm, I usually do `newpth = pth.joinpath(other)` or `newpth = Path(pth, other)`
[23:54:57] <akk> s/os.posixpath/posixpath/
[23:55:00] <deniska> overriding / is pretty much the only reason I reach for pathlib instead of older stuff

[23:55:34] <deniska> yeah, it's like "let's do some shenanigans, even if it takes an import"
[23:56:05] <deniska> (granted os.path.join also takes an import, but still, shenanigans)
[23:56:06] <bookworm> I mean it's probably more code for small stuff that a single path.join call

[23:56:44] <bookworm> keyboards really should not be virtual
[23:56:49] <deniska> read/write_bytes/text are also nice
[23:56:52] <SnoopJ> I've never written Python code that was particularly sensitive to the speed of path operations, heh.
[23:56:57] <deniska> I wish there also was append_bytes/text
[23:56:59] <bookworm> fair

[23:57:16] <bookworm> well, write() is append, no?
[23:57:38] <bookworm> if not particularly nice as you need to loop due to partial writes
[23:57:47] <deniska> I think write_text does 'w', not 'a'?
[23:57:52] <SnoopJ> I think so

[23:58:02] <bookworm> not sure, barely ever use that
[23:58:17] <SnoopJ> you wouldn't want to use it in a loop anyway because even if it were 'a' you'd be opening/closing that handle a bunch
[23:58:25] <SnoopJ> (well, assuming you care about that)
[23:58:29] *** Quits: lakrass (~lakrass@user/lakrass) (Quit: WeeChat 3.4)
[23:58:56] <deniska> maybe not in a tight loop, but in an event loop, sure, why not
[23:59:26] <SnoopJ> yea
