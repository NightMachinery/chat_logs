[01:08:33] <Guest78> is this like... a rule?
[01:09:07] <Z-module> If  I < K  and if x in rad(I), then some natural m exists ewith x^m in I, so also x^m in K, so x is also in rad(K)
[01:09:47] <Z-module> so rad(I) < rad(K)

[04:22:34] <Z-module> Guest78: yeah, if R is a commutative ring in which every ideal is principal (I don't think we need it to be a domain), so I = (a) and J = (b) for some specific a and b, then {all xy : x in I, y in J} = {(ra)(sb) : all r,s in R} = {tab : all t in R} = the ideal (ab).  So this set is an ideal here.

[05:39:52] <[itchyjunk]> mycroftiv, i've heard that very long math proof being written in this type of adga language would help verify it formally and this idea seems very interesting
[05:39:57] <isekaijin> Yeah, but if the goal is just to “understand”, then you can do that without a computer.
[05:40:05] <[itchyjunk]> modern proofs are supposidly getting longer and longer
[05:40:10] <Guest80> [itchyjunk]: the irony of it is, everything is tautology after you learn it, but actually, most math doesnt even get to level where it was never a tautology, most maths is tautological from beginning to start, created by absolute dunces
[05:40:19] <mycroftiv> isekaijin: actually for myself, i spent years kind of failing on that project, and then when i found agda, it started going way way better
[05:40:37] <[itchyjunk]> That's not a standard definition of tautology.
[05:40:44] <[itchyjunk]> Not everything is true.
[05:41:28] <mycroftiv> isekaijin: for me trying to learn set theory and logic by just reading books and not being in an academic course just didnt work, but then agda let my really do the work and concretize knowledge hands on
[05:41:55] <Guest80> most Ph/D theses are tautologies and never were not tautologies masquerading as non-trivialities hidden behind layers of unnecessary complexity and dogma created by people whose theories have long since become tautological themselves

[05:45:13] <[itchyjunk]> I took a stab at Coq and it was very hard for me
[05:45:18] <mycroftiv> so i wasnt able to do classical set theory of large cardinals 'directly' in agda - this is part of why it became so insanely over-educational. because i had to learn how type theory and set theory and category theory all relate

[07:03:43] <sonny> ok, ty
[07:04:07] <somiaj> to compute a_10 you have to first compute a_2 = 2 + 1 = 3, a_3 = 3 + 3 = 6, a_4 = 4 + 6 = 10, a_5 = 5 + 10 = 15, a_6 = 6 + 15 = 21, a_7 = 7 + 21 = 28, a_8 = 8 + 28 = 36, a_9 = 9 + 36 = 45, and a_10 = 10 = 45 = 55

[07:14:01] <somiaj> This could be subtle, do you know what A(n), B(n) and C(n) is. If they are only defined by recurrence relations, you have just hidden the recurrence relation

[07:15:40] <sonny> well, I think that has hidden the recurrence. This is the form R_0 = a; R_n = R_{n-1} + B + cn
[07:16:01] *** Joins: frost (~frost@user/frost)
[07:16:38] <sonny> the goal is to find A(n), B(n), and C(n)
[07:16:56] *** Joins: plankster (~plankster@user/plankers)
[07:17:02] <sonny> sorry, that last c should be C
[07:17:33] <sonny> I just want to get the terminology, I have the solution in front of me
[07:17:59] <sonny> understanding what is being said takes me some effort
[07:25:16] <sonny> ok, so R_n = A(n)a + B(n)b + C(n)c just becomes an equation I can use to get a, b, and c
[07:25:53] <sonny> I can use guess and check with the general recurrence and try to find a solution

[08:18:41] <Guest78> how do I solve this inequality: 1+x^3 - exp(-x) > 0 ?
[08:19:01] <Guest78> intuitively... i think this always works for x > 0
[08:20:53] <somiaj> well if f(x) = 1+x^3 - exp(-x), then f'(x) = 3x^2 + exp(-x) > 0 for all x
[08:21:27] <somiaj> so f(x) is always increasing. So since f(0) = 1 + 0 - 1 = 0, f(x) > 0 for x>0 since it is strictly increasing
[08:22:38] <frelleck> or just 1 - exp(-x) > - x^3 because the left hand side is positive and the right hand side is negative
[08:23:22] <PlanckWalk> Yep, and 1+x^3 - exp(-x) < 0 for all x < 0
[08:23:48] <PlanckWalk> So that's all the solutions.
[08:24:31] <Guest78> oh cool. Just take tyhe derivative
[08:24:50] <somiaj> Though the other solutions require less calculus

[09:45:13] <Guest78> somiaj still around? For x(1-x) > 0, f'(x) = 1 - 2x >0 => x < 1/2. but doesn't this work for any x in (0,1) and (-inf, -1) ?
[09:46:24] <somiaj> Using the derivative only statems where f(x) is increasing/decreasing. It can be used to argue inqualities, but you need additional information (such as the value of f(x) at some point)
[09:46:46] <somiaj> but for x(1-x) > 0, use a sign table, that would be the easiest method
[09:50:41] <Guest78> well,...for sure it works for 0<x<1. Cause that + * + = +.
[09:51:01] <Guest78> for x > 1, that is + * - = -
[09:51:10] <somiaj> Yup that is a sign table
[09:51:37] <Guest78> for -1 < x < 0, uhm... - * + = -
[09:51:49] <somiaj> you can actually do that for all x<0
[09:52:29] <Guest78> for x < 0: - * + = -
[09:52:43] <Guest78> so only (0,1) works.
[09:52:43] <Guest78> Thanks somaij!
[09:52:49] <somiaj> Yup

[14:47:12] <cadmio> the direct product is defined along with that operation
[14:48:01] <int-e> Yeah but you're supposed to translate juxtaposition to the appropriate group operation when groups become concrete.
[14:48:38] <river> cadmio: You still haven't answered my question, this is very rude

[18:57:10] <Klinda> isekaijin: page 11 https://cs229.stanford.edu/notes2020fall/notes2020fall/cs229-notes1.pdf
[18:57:11] <isekaijin> laurus: I don't think you absolutely need to know general topology to read that book.
[18:57:15] <isekaijin> Klinda: Let's see.
[18:58:18] <Klinda> thank you very much
[18:59:06] <laurus> isekaijin: There's a topology chapter there but now that I look at it it looks pretty brief
[19:01:01] <isekaijin> Klinda: In the last expression for “l(theta)”, you have an expression of the form “foo - bar”, where “foo” does not depend on theta, but “bar” does.
[19:01:38] <isekaijin> Klinda: So no matter what value you assign to theta, “foo” stays the same. Hence, maximizing “foo - bar” is the same as minimizing “bar”.
[19:02:21] <laurus> isekaijin: do you have a good method for figuring out which problems to do from a book?
[19:02:45] <isekaijin> laurus: The only method that I know is “Am I more interested than tired, or more tired than interested?”
[19:03:05] <isekaijin> Usually, I am only more interested than tired three days before the exam.
[19:03:07] <laurus> isekaijin: Haha okay. I have had some success in doing the "prime numbered" problems
[19:03:35] <laurus> I usually try to find a syllabus for the book I'm reading but sometimes I can't do that
[19:03:54] <Klinda> isekaijin: I don't understand because if you see the sign in the summation of the log likelihood are different, don't you see?
[19:04:14] <Klinda> it's y-h(x) instead of h(x) - y
[19:05:01] <isekaijin> Are we looking at the bottom of page 11?
[19:05:06] <Klinda> if you go up and see the J(theta) is not as they said
[19:05:08] <Klinda> yes
[19:06:07] <isekaijin> Klinda: https://i.imgur.com/m9ToMDP.png
[19:06:18] <isekaijin> Where is your h(x) - y?
[19:06:37] <Klinda> the cost function is J
[19:06:42] <Klinda> you have to go up to see it

[19:07:05] <isekaijin> Oh.
[19:07:14] *** Joins: epolanski (uid312403@id-312403.helmsley.irccloud.com)
[19:07:14] <isekaijin> In any case, (y - h(x))^2 = (h(x) - y)^2.
[19:07:32] <isekaijin> Because the square of a number is the same as the square of its negative.
[19:08:26] <Klinda> true
[19:10:32] <Klinda> but why so is the same as minimzing ?
[19:11:02] <Klinda> because it depends on theta
[19:11:05] <Klinda> and not the constants?
[19:11:28] <isekaijin> Suppose I give you the function f(x) = 5 - x, and I tell you that x can vary from 3 to 9.
[19:11:40] <isekaijin> In other words, neither x < 3 nor x > 9 is allowed.
[19:11:46] <isekaijin> How do you find the maximum value taht f(x) can attain?
[19:12:33] <Klinda> I prove all the values and see which numbe is the maximum
[19:12:50] <Klinda> 3,4,5,6,7,8,9
[19:13:09] <isekaijin> Huh?
[19:13:15] <isekaijin> There are lots of numbers between 3 and 9.
[19:13:18] <isekaijin> Not just the ones you listed.
[19:13:22] <Klinda> xD
[19:13:25] <isekaijin> Never did I say that x has to be an integer.
[19:13:41] <isekaijin> And, seriously, do you actually manually try a bunch of numbers?
[19:13:44] <isekaijin> Then we have a serious problem.
[19:14:27] <isekaijin> What I was trying to get at is that, if you want to maximize f(x), then you need to minimize x, because varying x cannot change the term 5 anyway.
[19:15:04] <isekaijin> And, since the allowed values of x go from 3 to 9, then obviously the smallest one is 3.

[19:20:43] <isekaijin> It is of the form “constant - <expression that depends on theta>”.

[22:59:12] *** Joins: sander (~sander@user/sander)
[22:59:23] <sonny> is it because it's a recurrence?
[23:00:32] <pavonia> I mean if you apply it only to the result, it's the same. But if you add the / 2^n to the recursive formula, the result will be different
[23:01:07] <sonny> The solution is T_n / 2^2 = T_{n-1}/2^(n-1) + 1/2^n, however my attempts do reduce it just shuffle stuff around lol
[23:03:13] <sonny> T_n /2^n on the lhs, my bad
[23:03:19] *** Joins: moog (~moog@107.77.244.45)
[23:05:25] <cherim> I don't understand, you have T_n = 2T_{n-1} + 1 initially. You divide by 2^n, you get T_n/2^n = (2/2^n)T_{n-1} + 1/2^n = T_{n-1}/2^{n-1} + 1/2^n.
[23:06:09] *** Joins: average (uid473595@user/average)
[23:06:30] <cherim> This may be some weird way to solve it as for Q_n=T_n / 2^n you now have Q_{n+1} = Q_n + 1/2^n so  Q_n = 1+1/2+1/4+...+1/2^{n-1} = 1-1/2^{n-1}
[23:06:53] <cherim> But it's even easier (and logically cleaner) to prove by induction in terms of original T_n
