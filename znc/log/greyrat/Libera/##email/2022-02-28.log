[15:47:01] <ychaouche> hello ##email gurus
[15:47:16] <ychaouche> I am trying to track down a delivery issue from hotmail to my e-mail servers
[15:49:36] <ychaouche> Hotmail still thinks my mail server IP is 10.10.10.19. This was an issue on our part, I don't know why exactly, but instead of our DNS having display the public IP, it displayed the private IP for our e-mail server. The public IP is 197.201.1.54. We fixed that (I think), and we are receiving mail from gmail, yahoo, a few others, but still no mail from hotmail.
[15:50:26] <ychaouche> the domain is @algerian-radio.dz
[15:54:10] <tuxick> https://pics.tuxick.net/comp/dns.jpg
[16:16:25] <pj> ychaouche: flaky dns servers are timing out for me.
[16:16:43] <ychaouche> pj: mine ?
[16:16:52] <pj> yep
[16:17:04] <pj> ; <<>> DiG 9.11.4-P2-RedHat-9.11.4-26.P2.el7_9.8 <<>> @dns-server.algerian-radio.dz. algerian-radio.dz MX
[16:17:11] <pj> ;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached
[16:17:18] <pj> ; <<>> DiG 9.11.4-P2-RedHat-9.11.4-26.P2.el7_9.8 <<>> @dns2-sec.algerian-radio.dz. algerian-radio.dz MX
[16:17:24] <pj> ;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached
[16:17:33] <ychaouche> network engineers aren't responding my calls, they me be down doing some operations
[16:18:10] <pj> I got a cached response from my local DNS servers, but could not reach yours with a trace.
[16:18:40] <ychaouche> the moment I tried to troubleshoot this issue they seem to also be doing some work on their part too.
[16:18:54] <ychaouche> this is not productive, I'll post-pone this task until they're done
[16:19:20] <pj> well, yeah, you can't troubleshoot dns-related problems if the dns servers are down.
[16:19:58] <ychaouche> Sorry pj for the inconvenience, I got the timing wrong 
[16:20:20] <pj> but my WAG is that the zone has a large TTL, and you actually fixed the issue, but the old record is still cached in a lot of resolvers.  If that's the case then you simply have to wait for the record to expire.
[16:23:53] <ychaouche> pj: I think I solved that in december...
[16:24:41] <pj> heh, okay, well that would be a *really* long TTL, then.  it was just a WAG.

[16:25:43] <ychaouche> bbl, going down to the basement
[16:26:33] <pj> ychaouche: at the end of the day, dig is your friend for troubleshooting this.  +trace gives you a nice trace from the root servers down and bypasses your local resolver so you can see what all the other resolvers on the internet see.  Don't forget to check both of your DNS servers when they're up to make sure they're both returning consistent, correct results.
