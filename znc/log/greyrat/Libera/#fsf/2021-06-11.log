[00:03:32] <asdflkj_sh> good strategy, as long as you look for rebuttals I think. IDK what the worst people say about rust is but here are a few critical things, with comments from rust fans (including at least one dev) and others: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21871479 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19482669 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26078318

[00:04:22] <aggi> the rust syntax is, unnecessarily, different, to name one problem, next it is closely coupled to llvm compiler suite which creates further dependencies which there wasn't any lack thereof before
[00:04:54] <aggi> then i don't see the benefit of wrapping c libraries into crates, introducing another build system, and so forth
[00:05:17] <aggi> all of which are reason enough to send any latest mozilla product onto package.mask here
[00:07:06] <aggi> as far as security benefits are concerned this is closely related to javascript bloat common with modern browsers and web-sites, and rust cannot in principle fix JIT related memory management issues anyway (such as enforcing W^X memory protection policies by the operating system)
[00:08:20] <aggi> furthermore rust and it's dependencies create some vendor lock-in to mozilla and llvm/clang vendors
[00:09:09] <aggi> and rust enforces the GNU people who develop GCC to catch up with a rust frontend which may or may not be wasted development time and resources invested more reasonably elsewhere instead
[00:10:48] <aggi> long story short, it isn't that problematic rust exists, it is problematic to not get rid of yet another language/compiler-frontend easily anymore
[00:15:07] <Arsen> odoood: I think this is best demostrated with a very well represenative example: https://github.com/ogham/exa/blob/master/Cargo.toml#L19-L48

[00:24:12] <Arsen> odoood: what?

[00:27:41] <Arsen> yeah, I'm sorry to see that myself. I think rusts memory safety guarantees are quite essential in modern software but ultimately rust screws up too many things too often
[00:27:53] *** Joins: calher (~KE0VVT@2605:a601:ae7b:a400:3091:216c:a0a6:f557)
[00:28:34] <Arsen> cargo is a huge failure in my eyes, and one of the first examples I've seen of rust making strange decisions is them using fixed-sized integer types by default (i32 vs int)
[00:28:42] <odoood> asdflkj_sh: that helps, ty
[00:29:16] *** Joins: KE0VVT (~KE0VVT@107.125.25.133)
[00:29:59] <Arsen> there's a reason C has `int' in the core language rather than i32 (where int32_t is delegated to the standard library), and the reason is that machines change, and usually when you ask for a 32 bit number that's not what you mean, rather, you just want a number of some sort
[00:30:22] *** Joins: specing_ (~specing@user/specing)
[00:31:10] <Arsen> and I'm sure this one will not receive widespread support due to the misinformation related to the topic but rusts lack of stable abi and dynamic linking support, and general stabilization make it unusable on production distributions such as rhel, rocky or debian

[00:33:05] <aggi> Arsen: concerning "security" it is in the scope of the operating system to enforce various memory protection policies (W^X, ASLR), and it is for example javascript JIT compiler/interpreter which prevents the approach to effectively enforce necessary policies
[00:33:26] <Arsen> what?
[00:33:27] <la_mettrie> is that int error difficult to fix then?
[00:33:27] <aggi> even if the javascript interpreter was implemented with rust this doesn't address some principle design flaws
[00:33:48] <Arsen> what does JS have to do with the stuff I was saying?
[00:34:01] <Arsen> la_mettrie: now? yes, when rust was a mere draft on a napkin? no
[00:34:22] *** Quits: specing (~specing@user/specing) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[00:34:22] *** specing_ is now known as specing
[00:34:41] <aggi> sorry if this created confusion, to my knowledge the argument of rust is "safety"/"security", henceforth mozilla chose to implement their javascript engine with rust
[00:35:06] <Arsen> safety, yes, and rust makes legitimate improvements in that area
[00:35:30] *** Joins: otisolsen70 (~otisolsen@xd4ed80b5.cust.hiper.dk)
[00:35:37] <aggi> which cannot in principle address some design flaws of a JIT-compiler/interpreter (javascript) present in web-browsers, regardless of what the rust/llvm people argue
[00:35:59] <Arsen> yes, JITs fundamentally break W^X, and that's less of an issue than it sounds
[00:36:11] <aggi> no, it is worse
[00:36:34] <aggi> hence clang/llvm intend to introduce "CFI" now, to complicate things further
[00:36:39] <Arsen> are you kidding
[00:36:51] <Arsen> CFI is completely unrelated
[00:37:11] <Arsen> rust would prevent some hard to detect memory failures (imagine struct user { char some_hash[60]; char profile_description[60]; }; struct user users[]; writing to users[1].profile_description in a manner that rust prevents by default could let you control someone elses password)
[00:37:15] <la_mettrie> arsen: in what kind of situations it's troublesome to ask for i32 instead of something non-specified?
[00:37:24] <Arsen> la_mettrie: portable software
[00:37:36] <Arsen> portable across machines and times
[00:38:12] <Arsen> i32 is *very* hard on some older machines, and i256 will be hard on current ones, if the current register sizes ever expand
[00:38:26] <Arsen> no matter, mcus still exist, and a surprisingly decent amount of code can be shared
[00:38:55] <odoood> i.e. any kind of software you want someone else to run at some point 
[00:39:34] <Arsen> aggi: mprotect(); compile code, mprotect()
[00:39:41] <la_mettrie> intuitively one could imagine that also asking for ints of a non-specific size could lead to troubles at times (because the code may accidentially suppose a certain size) 
[00:40:16] <Arsen> the code isn't assuming a side, the uninformed programmer is
[00:40:19] <Arsen> stdint.h exists for a reason
[00:40:40] <Arsen> as for CFI, Intel is implementing CET in newer cpus, which is actually quite neat, I wish it existed before, I want it in my CPUs :P
[00:40:46] <aggi> Arsen? it is the operating-system's responsibility to enforce policies of which mprotect() calls are permitted, and which aren't; rust/llvm cannot fix this
[00:40:46] *** Quits: KE0VVT (~KE0VVT@107.125.25.133) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)

[00:41:04] *** Joins: calher (~KE0VVT@cpe-70-94-86-184.kc.res.rr.com)
[00:41:55] <aggi> because almost always script interpreters depend on unrestricted mprotect() etc.; and rust/llvm cannot fix this
[00:42:00] <Arsen> to be clear, I think the world would have been much better off if JavaScript didn't get a JIT compiler, but the JVM doing JIT compilation is quite nice
[00:42:08] <Arsen> and no one claimed they ca?
[00:42:09] <Arsen> can*?
[00:42:32] <Arsen> whoever says rust fixes all memory issues is just misinformed
[00:42:45] <Arsen> and, analougly, whoever says rust fixes none is also misinformed
[00:43:22] <aggi> to my knowledge it doesn't fix one of the most relevant with regards to security: mprotect() and related policies
[00:43:26] *** Joins: I_am_6r1d (~6r1d@46.61.27.235)
[00:43:42] <Arsen> how is that most relevant?
[00:44:06] <Arsen> I mean, it may be in whatever firefoxes script engine is, but in the average case, not even close
[00:44:17] <aggi> because enforcement of strict policies would prevent 99% of critical buffer-overflows being exploitable
[00:44:48] <Arsen> I reckon preventing buffer overflows in general also makes them unexploitable :P
[00:45:40] <aggi> sure, and full w^x would prevent all of them, operating system can reliably report violations etc.

[00:45:57] <Arsen> would it?
[00:46:08] <Arsen> return pointers on the stack are not in executable memory
[00:46:16] <aggi> if implemented correctly? yes.
[00:47:17] <Arsen> how would w^x prevent pointers on the stack, not in executable memory, being written to?
[00:48:07] <aggi> the pointers could not point to any arbitrary region being both writable and executable
[00:48:19] <Arsen> and they don't need to
[00:49:29] <aggi> nonetheless i fail to see the benefit of not enforcing strict policies
[00:50:58] <Arsen> I fail to see who said rust should be used instead of strict mitigations instead of to supplement said mitigations
[00:51:07] <aggi> and this applied to either, anything written in rust or C
[00:51:39] <Arsen> yes?
[00:51:44] <Arsen> I fail to see who said rust should be used instead of strict mitigations instead of to supplement said mitigations
[00:52:19] <aggi> javascript interpreter says so, written in rust, since it prevents enforcement of strict policies
[00:52:41] <Arsen> yes? since using rust has tangable memory safety benefits, and the more the merrier
[00:53:48] <Arsen> plus, W^X and JIT aren't completely impossible to coexist, it depends on how much you restrict mprotect, allowing only one of the two flags to exist at the same time rather than for the entire runtime of the page would allow both cases
[00:53:56] <Arsen> and even the latter would allow jits to exist
[00:55:58] <aggi> ironically mozilla chose to implement some mitigations (related to w^x policies) within mozilla runtime enviroment itself, meanwhile this is the OS responsibility to enforce such
[00:56:23] <Arsen> yet the average linux install doesn't enforce them
[00:56:34] <aggi> yes!
[00:56:58] <Arsen> so why are you complaining about extra mitigations?
[00:57:43] <Arsen> those won't hurt anyone, they should be enforced on the kernel level more by default sure, but I don't see why in a world where backwards compat concerns prevent that (for now) it's bad to allow programs to do it themselves
[00:57:51] <aggi> already tried to explain what i think of rust/llvm and the motives involved
[00:58:34] <Arsen> I highly doubt there's some ulterior motive, more likely just to be academic exercise of practically insignificant practices blown up to greater proportions than they actually are
[00:59:20] <aggi> btw. netsurf-browser is written C, and didn't violate any policies enforced by the OS
[00:59:35] <Arsen> it's also unusable in 2021
[00:59:59] <aggi> amazing, isn't it?
[01:00:07] <Arsen> no not particularly
[01:00:17] <Arsen> and certainly, the current state of the rust (lack of) standardization and the lack of diversity in implementation are reasons not to use it in production, but I'd not blacklist rust code off of my PC, just off of my servers :)
