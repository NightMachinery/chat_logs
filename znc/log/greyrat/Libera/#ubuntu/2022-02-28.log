[03:57:28] <Diagon> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/acpi-call/+bug/1953261
[03:57:30] <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1953261 in acpi-call (Ubuntu) "kernel >= 5.13 BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference" [Undecided, Fix Released]
[03:57:31] <dwitt1974> good evening. i'm noticing something bizarre with my HP dy2037nr notebook's keyboard when I log into X (no matter which environment [KDE or Unity). When I first log into X immediately after a reboot/startup, my keyboard is unresponsive for at least 20-30 seconds. It's as if the PS/2 bus isn't fully initialized by the time I log in.  I'm using 21.10.
[03:58:17] <dwitt1974> i have autologin enabled too.
[03:58:23] <Diagon> tomreyn - what I need to know is if I should delete dump-* in both ../efivars and ../vars
[03:59:05] <sybariten> hey hey
[03:59:59] <dwitt1974> oddly enough, my trackpad is responding without an issue.
[04:00:10] <sybariten> where do you suggest i _start_ troubleshooting a mount error using mount.cifs against a remote samba/cifs share, that renders a "mount error(2): No such file or directory"  ?

[04:00:54] *** Joins: Mitacho (~Mitacho@186.235.35.219)

[04:02:40] <sybariten> except for the mount error line, i also got "Refer to the mount.cifs(8) manual page (e.g. man mount.cifs) and kernel log messages (dmesg)" - is dmesg related to syslog, dwitt1974  ?
[04:03:32] <Mitacho> My problem with USB mic on Linux is solved ( It was either that or going bald stressing me out for nothing ): https://twitter.com/Mitacho_/status/1498088474838192129?s=20&t=tFMzKs3DX9kV_ilbsm2ZkA
[04:03:53] <dwitt1974> dmesg does the kernel messages
[04:04:11] <dwitt1974>  /var/log/syslog is what i would look at too
[04:04:35] <dwitt1974> try tailing the syslog when you try the command.
[04:04:54] <Mitacho> Bonsoir.

[04:16:03] <jhutchins> sybariten: Does the provider have instructions on how to connect to the share?
[04:16:26] <sybariten> i connect to ssh servers now and then but i've never done port forwarding.... this account though, there's no ssh shell access, only scp

[04:22:24] <rfm> sybariten, I can certainly imagine your router could be blocking traffic out on port 445.  It might be worth trying "nc that.server.de 445" just to see if it is the net

[04:23:21] <sybariten> ok

[11:56:16] <fruity_tomato> Hello :)  question regarding package management. Client has ubuntu 20.04, we have our own dev env. they want to update a wide array of packages on their system and sent us the suggested upgrade log if it's okay. Is there a better way of tracking/comparing packages between our and their system without connecting them? maybe a tool too export/import
[11:56:17] <fruity_tomato> these kind of things and automate further

[12:12:20] <alkisg> Sure, there are many unsupported things that are not really broken; just unsupported
[12:12:35] <alkisg> E.g. you may keep security issues for decades and yet not have any intruder
[12:12:42] <frost-core> you can franken ubuntu by adding old repos

[13:15:18] <fruity_tomato> alkisg, Croran not selective update, just wondering what are some good practices around this. It's the first time I have this "problem", where the client sends us their terminal output of their apt-upgrade command (before upgrading) and asking us to confirm if it's okay to upgrade, which includes 100+ packages. My first approach is to take their
[13:15:19] <fruity_tomato> output, parse it, upgrade our environment to match the upgraded versions they have and give them the green light

[13:19:13] <fruity_tomato> well, the thing is also their env is physically different, so for example they might have some packages related to hardware drivers, we dont have. so some kind of cross compare would be needed.

[15:35:09] <topoi> alive: Thanks, I really appreciate. I need to clarify, because I mixed some things up: I'm using Ubuntu's GUI for configuring VPN and I can reproduce the problem when using openconnect. Addressing your mitigations: setting it manually shows no effect ("resolvectl dns" lack any DNS settings like those "mcli" shows). In /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf there is no "dns=dnsmasq" to comment out and as
[15:35:15] <topoi> there is no client.conf I cannot change any client.conf. Also the configuration in /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/ seems fine. Though I can set those manually with "resolvectl dns vpn0 $nameservers" each time I need to get this without manual intervention.
