[00:00:14] <lagash> Anyone know of a way to open an archive webpage URL from the Message-ID? I know mail-archive.com has a feature to do that, but I was hoping to also access the "original" archive, like through pipermail or hyperkitty or what else is out there..

[04:05:33] <pabs3> lagash: I have a list to all the known Message-ID search web pages here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message-ID
[04:05:53] <pabs3> if you know of any that are missing there, please add them
[04:06:06] <pabs3> AFAIK, pipermail and hyperkitty don't support this feature

[04:06:41] <pabs3> some of them require you to know the list name too, not just the Message-ID
[04:25:37] <lagash> pabs3: I was not expecting WikiPedia to have a solution, haha!
[04:25:47] <lagash> knowing the list name won't be a problem for me in my case
[04:26:03] <pabs3> yeah, I didn't know where to put it, so I put it there :)
[04:27:07] <pabs3> er, I lie, someone else started it, I just expanded it

[21:53:11] <acdw> has anyone used Fastmail's tags feature with notmuch yet?
[21:53:17] <acdw> i might have to be the guinea pig
[21:53:42] <bremner> I think you might. It doesn't ring a bell for me, anyway.
[22:00:34] <acdw> thanks bremner.
