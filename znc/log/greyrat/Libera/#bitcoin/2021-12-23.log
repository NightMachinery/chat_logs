[16:47:19] <maret> buZz well thats what esplora does, it's api is bit slow for my purposes. They use electrs on a backend, I've tried to access electrum server underneath it but it supports 1.4.1 protocol which seems to be limited - no support for paging transactions

[16:48:18] <buZz> your -local- esplora is too slow?
[16:48:30] <buZz> whats a paging transaction?
[16:49:36] <maret> yes it's slow. Main issue is that their api for transactions for a address is based on pointer so I can only read transactions in sequence 25 at the time by default( you can increase this to a degree).
[16:49:56] <maret> and reading 25 or even 500 transaction per request for address with 600k transactions is a painfully slow
[16:52:25] <maret> the workaround would be to  use eelectrum protocol, but  paging will be only added https://github.com/spesmilo/electrumx/pull/90 so another option is to access RocksDB although at this point I might as well use my own db

[17:06:18] <buZz> what part of 'install locally program X and abuse its database' would using a remote api solve?
[17:07:00] <maret> sorry I mean I am uring their code (open source) which provides API to their RocksDB locally and it's slow because API design
[17:08:48] <buZz> ah yes, so why are you even using the API, i suggested using their -db- :D
[17:09:00] <buZz> whats the actual goal , btw? you still havent said

[19:06:56] <jwpapi> I would like to set something up that explains what to do if I die. I don’t want my funds to get lost, but I feel like if I send my  mum an email containing this information this is like sending out an explanation on how to assault me
[19:13:34] <buZz> jwpapi: you could write it on paper and send it to her for safekeeping
[19:13:35] <NickRegistered> Can someone link me to documentation for bitcoin-cli? specifically how to specify an ip address to connect to. Crying shame that bitcoin cash is the top result when searching for this info
[19:13:48] <jwpapi> buZz: lol how simple
[19:14:17] <buZz> jwpapi: was there some other requirement?
[19:14:57] <NickRegistered> never mind, i just googled the info from the bitcon cash docs to confirm that bitcoin works the same.
[19:15:20] <buZz> -connect=8.8.8.8 , isnt it?
[19:15:24] <jwpapi> buZz: I don’t think so. I would probably like to give it to two people (mum and dad) and they only can access it together and if one of them dies to before I need to think of someone else to have it.
[19:15:35] <jwpapi> That minimizes the risk of my mum alone getting assaulted.
[19:15:57] <jwpapi> My funds won’t be accessible instantly any way
