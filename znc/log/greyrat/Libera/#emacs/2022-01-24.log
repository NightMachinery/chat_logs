[00:00:24] <Defsubst> i need to test it, that's it

[00:00:54] <Defsubst> obviously it cannot do miracles with what Lisp inherently is: slow
[00:01:16] <Defsubst> also does it run on clang?
[00:01:19] <Defsubst> despites the name
[00:02:12] <wgreenhouse> Defsubst: the startup time may actually be _slower_, in particular the first time, because it can't reuse *.elc bytecode files, and generates *.eln the first time it loads stuff
[00:02:16] <wgreenhouse> subsequent runs should be faster
[00:02:21] <Defsubst> i see
[00:02:23] <wgreenhouse> and no, does not build under clang
[00:02:37] <Defsubst> so it uses gcc extensions
[00:02:40] <Defsubst> not that it is a problem

[00:03:20] <Defsubst> i first encountered gcc at version 2.95.4
[00:03:25] <Defsubst> that was in 1999 i think
[00:03:28] <artefact> for several years
[00:03:40] <Defsubst> you mean the IR has been improved ?
[00:03:52] <Defsubst> that's the huge plus points of clang
[00:04:04] <artefact> not so much a "true JIT" as a programmatic interface to the compiler, perhaps
[00:04:20] <Defsubst> yes that is what i mean
[00:04:28] <Defsubst> the gcc API 1) didn't exist back then
[00:04:35] <Defsubst> 2) no idea what its state now
[00:04:40] <artefact> well, now there is one
[00:04:45] <Defsubst> otoh the clang api is useable
[00:04:47] <Defsubst> ok
[00:05:06] <artefact> it's good enough for gcc emacs, but maybe not on par with llvm's suite of tools

[00:05:49] <Defsubst> it is valid, and it doesn't break every other release
[00:05:59] <Defsubst> basically it's the usual visitor API for the AST
[00:06:02] <Defsubst> and in C++
[00:06:05] <Defsubst> which helps.

[00:07:02] <Defsubst> in the year 2005 so i wrote a language
[00:07:08] <Defsubst> the gcc ir was lisp-expressed

[00:24:33] <Defsubst> ok!
[00:24:41] <Defsubst> let's send stuff into earth orbit now
[00:25:02] <lampilelo> so how does it relate to not allocating resources to android?
[00:25:08] <lampilelo> android is linux
[00:25:24] <Defsubst> lampilelo they allocate resources to the linux kernel
[00:25:30] <Defsubst> not to the Android SDK
[00:25:40] <Defsubst> because they use the linux kernel in every of their datacenters

[00:26:20] <chrisb> right
[00:26:26] <Defsubst> why else would you contribute
[00:26:40] <Defsubst> if you do, it means you are an engineer and are tasked to fix a kernel bug

[00:27:48] <Defsubst> anyway my point is
[00:27:51] <Defsubst> sure open source is a thing

[00:30:04] <Defsubst> ok not an abuse
[00:30:05] <lampilelo> i think i heard somewhere that they used to use freebsd but switched to linux, although it's just a hearsay, idk

[00:30:18] <Defsubst> lampilelo i started with it in 2001

[00:30:54] <Defsubst> i don't need no medal but i mean
[00:30:59] <Defsubst> it was more, organized

[00:32:33] <Defsubst> coz Google needed it
[00:33:00] <wgreenhouse> nothing's perfect, but in a lot of scenarios it reduces the attack surface
[00:33:18] <Defsubst> of course it will throttle things
[00:33:24] <Defsubst> but as you say nothing is perfect
[00:33:27] <Defsubst> to me it is bloat
[00:33:37] <Defsubst> but the point is Google needed it
[00:33:44] <Defsubst> so they forced it onto the linux kernel
[00:33:47] <Defsubst> and that's it!

[01:46:24] <lampilelo> AeroNotix: so how is pinebook pro? what's the cpu usage when watching a 1080p youtube video?
[01:46:38] <twb> lampilelo: in wayland, or legacy?
[01:46:40] <AeroNotix> lampilelo: I haven't monitored that specifically but it doesn't work great
[01:46:49] <lampilelo> twb: both?
[01:46:58] <twb> mpv whinges if you force it to use wayland
[01:47:01] <AeroNotix> lampilelo: it tends to auto select progressively lower and lower resolutions until it works
[01:47:04] <twb> firefox defaults to legacy
[01:47:12] <twb> chromium only supports legacy on Debian
[01:47:13] <AeroNotix> would try now but... compiling
[01:47:56] <twb> On my fancy 2019-era thinkpad, it uses a full CPU core to watch full-resolution video in mpv on wayland
[01:48:08] <twb> i.e. enough CPU that the fan has to turn on after 5 minutes
[01:48:41] <twb> I'm only using the open-source intel graphics driver, though
[01:48:42] <bpalmer> That seems fair.  I use a whole brain to watch full-resolution video.
[01:49:01] <twb> I tried the proprietary driver for a little while but I didn't notice an improvement
[01:49:12] <twb> bpalmer: really?  I usually only have it on in the background while doing something else
[01:49:46] <bpalmer> seems like a lot of resolution is being wasted, then

[02:40:08] <grym> there are a few ytdl gui front-ends
[02:40:15] <grym> but, uh. that's not waht i use it for
[02:40:17] <bpalmer> ahem. the best way to watch youtube videos is in your full-featured browser on youtube.com
[02:40:22] <AeroNotix> tui specifically
[02:40:39] <grym> the best way to stream chilledcow, however
[02:40:46] <lampilelo> grym: i have a (kinda dumb) script that uses xdotool to check what window is focused and if it's a browser it copies the url to the clipboard and if it's youtube/invidious it opens it in mpv

[02:41:25] <lampilelo> i like having a unified interface for watching videos, browser media players are just bad
[02:41:45] <grym> then if you're fzf enabled, you can enqueue a bunch of streams nicely in your command history and listen to 'em in tmux
[02:41:50] <AeroNotix> plus the browser bloat tax you have to pay on top of the video itself
[02:42:02] <grym> and then my GPU has sliiiightly more ram to crunch numbers with
[02:42:27] <bpalmer> yes, licenses get in the way of stuff.
[02:42:36] <grym> mpv + fzf is a ... weird choice for a music player

[10:12:11] <codingquark> I've picked up Dune
[10:12:22] <corwin> oh nice. my mum's favorite book
[10:12:25] <codingquark> Someone here was saying there are like 70 dune books
[10:12:42] <twb> codingquark: the first three are good, especially the first one which is basically "What If Space Arabs Had A Space Jesus"
[10:12:52] <corwin> his son and a another writer have picked up writing them, starting with some prequils, IIRC
[10:13:01] <twb> But absolutely avoid the ones written by Kevin J. Anderson
[10:13:07] <twb> They are unreadable trash
[10:13:21] <codingquark> Okay
[10:13:31] <twrk> pre-quills
[10:13:38] <corwin> imo, if you read e.g. wheel of time they aren't too bad

For any non trivial (<15 LoC) contributions to Emacs, developers are required to assign copyright for their work to the FSF.

[20:20:14] <twb> It seems like cmake people just start using variables

[20:20:23] <rpav> or use cmake-gui

[20:20:50] <rpav> err, -LH or -LAH is probably more helpful but yeah
[20:21:04] <twb> Hrm OK let me try that
[20:21:05] <rpav> but so are the cmake gui/tui
[20:21:19] <twb> I don't understand why you'd use an interactive interface
[20:21:30] <twb> You can't log an interactive UI.  You can't grep it.
[20:21:41] <rpav> because there are lots of options and organization helps, and sometimes the options have a predefined set of "valid" values, etc
[20:21:52] <rpav> grep is just search, and you can search
[20:22:10] <rpav> and "log" is sortof not relevant, because you write the output anyway ;)

[20:24:23] <rpav> these days i have a `config-pkg` script to configure with most config systems, and handle the basic options, and also write a `reconfig` script that calls `config-pkg` with what you just did, so in 3 months when you need to update/build again, you don't have to remember what worked ;)
[20:24:24] <twb> rpav: oh so it's like "make menuconfig" because there's literally 50,000 options
[20:24:28] <twb> and they have interdependencies
[20:24:57] <twb> The documentation in gnucash doesn't mention any options, and I wouldn't trust it if it did

[23:22:04] <rpav> i guess i haven't paid close attention, but i mean, this is MS
[23:22:09] <Odin-> rpav: The thing is, the Windows racket is pretty much independent of what's going on technologically.
[23:22:15] <Catie> I mean, I'm inclined to agree. If I wanted to steal sensitive information there's _way_ better ways to go about it than openly photographing a whiteboard
[23:22:16] <rpav> they haven't changed
[23:22:39] <Catie> aidalgol: I am enamored with this beast
[23:22:40] <aidalgol> Catie: I was thinking more of leaving "sensitive information" on a whiteboard.
[23:22:51] <Catie> In the hallway no less!
[23:22:52] <aidalgol> rpav: Everyone freaked out about Windows 10 being "locked to online account".
[23:22:59] <rpav> Odin-: sure .. i mean, they could do all this under the guise of windows 10
[23:23:01] <Odin-> rpav: Neither have Apple nor Google, so...
[23:23:12] <rpav> aidalgol: this is apparently moreso
[23:23:14] <Odin-> rpav: They _did_ most of it under Windows 10.

[23:23:56] <aidalgol> Vista was the end of the world.
[23:23:59] <rpav> aidalgol: that doesn't make it less true; every time it _has_ been true
[23:23:59] <aidalgol> Then it was 7.
[23:24:21] <Odin-> rpav: Dunno, I remember this ruckus being raised about Win95 and Win98.
[23:24:44] <rpav> Odin-: which ruckus? win98 wasn't a free upgrade but i wasn't really using dos/win those days
[23:24:50] <Odin-> rpav: And yet I think you won't find many people who'd say they prefer 3.11 to anything that's come since.
[23:24:52] <aidalgol> Then it was 8.  Then it was 8.1.. Then it was 10

[23:25:51] <acdw> win10 is actually okay, i agree. but boo
[23:25:59] <hodapp> also because XP lacks a lot of the annoying obnoxious bullshit and telemetry
[23:26:00] <aidalgol> "Waaaa, it's different.  They ruined everything!  I'm never upgrading!"
[23:26:09] <Catie> I very much preferred 7 to 10

[23:26:13] <Odin-> rpav: And there's people who swear FreeBSD will usurp Linux any day now.
[23:26:19] <aidalgol> hodapp: So does 7, and 7 is more stable than XP.
[23:26:31] <rpav> Odin-: sure but i don't see how that's relevant. people actually use XP
[23:26:36] <JordiGH> What's the state of the art with Python in Emacs?
[23:26:37] <hodapp> aidalgol: I feel like I ran into more annoying bullshit with activation on 7
[23:26:42] <JordiGH> Tell me what to use instead of elpy.
[23:26:45] <rpav> no one's claiming XP is going to take over, just that it was better than the stuff since

[23:35:57] <twb> aidalgol: I *hate* whatever dickhead decided to bump the major version
[23:35:59] <rpav> it's possible they mostly want a version number because the UI is slightly different enoguh for people to expect it, and not wake up and have it shoved on their system involuntarily, which i guess _saves_ MS money at least
[23:36:02] <JordiGH> ShinyRice: how about Aatsita-Mahkan, is that a Canadian enough name for you?

[23:37:21] <aidalgol> ShinyRice: wth is a "canadian name"?
