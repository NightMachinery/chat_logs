[03:30:41] <cahoots_> hi, i'm working with a large, legacy react js app and have to fix a bug. the bug is that when a user clicks on a button to go to a different page, it takes about 5 seconds before it actually starts loading the new page. in the callback for the button, it just sets window.location.href to the new url. any ideas what might be causing the delay? even when i set the url to https://google.com, i still see
[03:30:47] <cahoots_> it. i verified that it goes past this line of code, too, with console.log

[03:38:35] <adsc> doesn't react have pretty good debug tools?
[03:38:58] <adsc> anyway, i would try in different browsers at first to verify it's not some weird browser quirk

[03:42:27] <adsc> then i would insert a console.log with a searchable text as output and search this in the debugger to place a breakpoint, then work my way up the call stack to see if something strange happens and also activate all event listener breakpoints

[10:45:27] <ljharb> OnkelBlade: is it https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-spring ? because it doesn't have a readme and only has 600k downloads a week
[10:46:21] <ljharb> OnkelBlade: ok so the repo has a readme (that the npm package doesn't is also a bad sign) and it looks like it's just animations, but all the testimonials in the repo readme are from 2018
[10:46:29] <ljharb> so at least it's not like java spring :-p
[10:46:54] <ljharb> lottie's what i'd suggest for animations tho
[10:47:46] <OnkelBlade> Thank for the suggestion ljharb, never heard of that on
[10:47:49] <OnkelBlade> one
[10:48:35] <ljharb> it's mainly a RN thing, but there's a lottie-web also
[10:48:58] <ljharb> animations themselves are tiny json blobs, so they can be updated over the wire and fetched from APIs without needing any code change
[10:49:04] <OnkelBlade> omg, it's awful that they're missing the README. Their website is https://react-spring.io/
[10:49:29] <gde33> who wants to be writing manuals
[10:50:03] <OnkelBlade> No, it's good. It's just no there. I don't know why. Their github page has it

[12:34:38] <Maxdamantus> though if you're concerned about that unnecessary render, it's probably better to avoid an unconditional `requestAnimationFrame`, and only call it when `sceneChanged` is going to be true.

[14:33:06] <n00b101> can somebody have a look at this question..
[14:33:27] <zzz> do you import you config file as a module?
[14:33:36] <zzz> i'd agree that's a bad idea

[14:37:48] <Maxdamantus> imo configuration files should be read in such a way that they could be pipes passed from the command line (ie, they're only read once, and there's no seeking involved)

[15:02:23] <n00b101> i have a general question then.. there are 2 seperate functions where each does some computation and return the result into a var. 2 functions are running at same time when an event is called. NOW, there's a 3rd function (let's say give_it_to_backend() ) which would like to get the return vars of these 2 functions, make it a json and send it to backend. NOW, i stricllty speaking, on event triggers, its calling(function1,function2)those
[15:02:23] <n00b101> 2 functions are not executing parallell, 1st function is called, it computes, it then calls give_it_to_backend() , same does for 2nd. But. the give_it_to_backend()  expect 2 return values at same time and send to the bacekend. right?
[15:02:28] <n00b101> what do we do here
[15:03:26] <D4mned> promises i guess
[15:03:59] <thykka> any recommendations for a decent accordion plugin with few if any dependencies?
[15:04:18] <D4mned> you could make the 2 functions a promise and then make the send to backend function wait for them

[16:44:46] <Cork> also what are you using for the user input? <input type="datetime-local"> is translating utc to localtime
[16:44:58] <joakimk> we're using react-dates
[16:45:04] <Cork> ah
[16:45:31] <Cork> well do you want to convert the time to the new timezone or just strip the local zone?
[16:45:33] <joakimk> the user is setting an ETA for a destination in some timezone, but we just want the date/time to be just date-time -- no timezone. The backend/system knows the timezone from the destination
[16:45:41] <joakimk> so frontend shouldn't have to deal with it at all
[16:46:01] <joakimk> parseZone strips timezone, doesn't it?
[16:46:11] <Cork> so the user should know what timezone it is talking about from the destionation you mean
[16:46:15] <joakimk> yes
[16:46:27] <Cork> that is ugg, but ok
[16:46:29] <joakimk> user just says 3 dec 11:00
[16:46:40] *** Quits: eron (~eron@177.106.178.236) (Quit: Ping timeout (120 seconds))
[16:46:46] <Cork> that means you have to parse the datestring and then force the timezone to be utc
[16:46:51] <joakimk> gotcha
[16:47:05] <Cork> cause again datetime - zone is not a thing
[16:47:13] <Cork> it always has one
[16:47:19] <joakimk> right
[16:47:30] <joakimk> and it'll easily get the local time of the user, right?
[16:47:36] <joakimk> of the clinet
[16:47:37] <joakimk> client
[16:47:41] <Cork> not really
[16:48:02] <Cork> but if the time is in the location you want, you just need to force the timezone to be a specific one
[16:48:09] <joakimk> any actually
[16:48:11] <Cork> then your calculation is alreay agains that one
[16:48:15] <joakimk> yes
[16:48:22] <Cork> hence the force utc
[16:48:30] <joakimk> thanks!
[16:48:34] <joakimk> would you do .utc then?

[16:50:17] <Cork> simplest is prob to just take ex. "2021-11-17T10:10:10" and just add Z and the end
[16:50:44] <Cork> then you don't get localtime but utc

[22:18:27] <jellobot> silly, document.wrong. Please use something more modern and less prone to doing confusing things. This function tries to write to the current document. If the document has already been processed, the document will be replaced with a blank one with your argument. You don't want that; use the proper DOM methods instead.
