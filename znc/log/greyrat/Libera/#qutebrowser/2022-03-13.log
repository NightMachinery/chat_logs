[01:32:01] <jmcantrell> The-Compiler: how is https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/qutebrowser-git updated?
[01:36:27] <jmcantrell> I'm just wondering how my aur helper will know that there's an update. I just installed it, and :version shows it's based off a recent commit, but the pkgbuild shows it was updated in 2021.
[01:44:56] <thorsten`> when creating the package, the pkgver() function updates the local package's version to include the current commit
[01:45:52] <thorsten`> probably, the aur helper does not know when there's an update, but will just know that git packages have updates quite often
[01:45:56] <jmcantrell> why does :version show that it's based off a recent commit but the aur page says it was updated last year?
[01:47:10] <thorsten`> the aur page displays the information from the pkgbuild, but does not evaluate the pkgver() function in it
[01:47:46] <thorsten`> the :version probably accesses version information in source and is independent of the package manager metadata
[01:53:38] <jmcantrell> ah, you're right. there's a --devel option for pikaur that i hadn't noticed before. thanks!
[01:54:18] <The-Compiler> jmcantrell, thorsten`: Same as any other VCS aur package - and yes, some AUR helpers can check the VCS repos individually for updates.

[14:57:17] <Earnest> How do you set aliases in config.py without using the c.aliases shorthand?
[14:57:45] <Earnest> Hm, with bind apparently?
[15:07:11] <Earnest> So apparently I can use set(), but this doesn't append to the aliases and so all of them needed to be written out
[15:15:51] <Earnest> I'll just have to include the defaults then
[15:24:55] <arza> maybe config_dict_add
[15:25:23] <arza> why though?
[15:30:55] <Earnest> Why what?  Is adding an alias surprising?
[15:31:06] <Earnest> Or that I don't like using shorthand/sugar?
[15:34:22] <arza> latter
[15:41:04] <Earnest> I prefer consistency in things
[15:44:40] <Earnest> (And generally dislike anything that requires obfuscation, trickery, etc. which only really tends to help those who lack access to decent text editors)

[16:28:28] <arza> config_dict_add isn't available in config.py without a hack
[16:42:30] <Earnest> Yeah, config is ConfigAPI which only exposes set, get, bind, unbind
[16:43:28] <Earnest> arza: Oh, I suppose I could get and then add to it
[16:48:32] <Earnest> arza: config.set('aliases', config.get('aliases').update({'help': 'help -t'}))
