[05:08:02] <topcat001> Essentially the same problem as discrete GPU -> HDMI monitor + internal display connected to Intel.
[05:08:17] <noze> it's a bit different from what I'm used from optimus where you have no dedicated video ports on your internal discrete gpu 🤷‍
[05:09:01] <predicament> noze
[05:09:08] <predicament> I have a dual GPU setup
[05:09:14] <topcat001> Yes that's the "muxless" config, where only the Intel GPU is wired to the physical ports.
[05:09:18] <predicament> you're gonna need a good xorg
[05:09:42] <predicament> oh you already have tried optimus
[05:09:50] <predicament> i actually recently noticed i might be having issues.
[05:09:51] <noze> crap, /etc/X11 is one of the worst parts of /etc -.-
[05:09:56] <predicament> it is
[05:10:00] <predicament> but.. i mean
[05:10:04] <topcat001> In those setups, it is possible to render everything on the discrete, and have the Intel simply copy the output.
[05:10:05] <predicament> it is what it is i guess
[05:10:18] <predicament> it's possible but it's not very effective for me
[05:10:23] <noze> I tried optimus with my internal discrete gpu, not yet with the egpu. not sure how that'd work.

[09:52:10] <LordRishav> Yes, Chromium does support portals
[09:52:11] <grawity> zenity is like kdialog but for gtk3
[09:52:59] <grawity> if you run zenity with GTK_USE_PORTAL=1 and you get the Qt dialog, then I at least know the xdg-desktop-portal part is working

[10:57:57] <ymir> Hey all I was wondering if I could get some pointers on solving an issue I've been having for years now.  I run Arch on an X230 and periodically USB disks would just stop showing up in lsblk and in /dev, despite being logged in dmesg.  This is easily fixed by rebooting, but I'm wondering if there's a better solution.

If anyone feels like creating a package including the latest patch from https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=204807, I'd highly appreciate it. Otherwise I'll try to

[14:52:26] <NetSysFire> systemd-run may be your friend here
[14:53:33] <kyentei> Any people on here using ZFS on Arch? I've been reading through the wiki but I'm looking for some best practices. For example, the current DKMS module don't work with the 5.14 kernel and I'm wondering how people go about updating their system. Do people just stay on 5.13 until DKMS works again or apply patches to make ZFS work on 5.14 themselves?

[14:55:44] <NetSysFire> carbolymer: there is also iowait, that can slow down your system significantly, too
[14:56:39] <carbolymer> NetSysFire: slowdown would be fine tho - I'm having total "halt", like HDD LED isn't even blinking
[14:56:48] <jasper_> kyentei: I've been installing arch yesterday and stumbled on the issue with openzfs-2.1.0 not compining with 5.13/5.14 kernel, I solved it with installing archzfs-dkms-git. For now it's a temporary solution. I was thinking about the LTS kernel with archzfs-dkms.
[14:59:14] <jasper_> Not that this is considered 'best practice', I've just got back to Arch after many years so I'm also looking for some solution to this.

[14:59:34] <kyentei> jasper_: I was thinking the same thing, using linux-lts - but what happens when the LTS kernel gets bumped (say to 5.16) and DKMS builds fail on 5.16 as well
[14:59:56] <kyentei> There's no "this kernel works with ZFS" guarantee, I guess
[14:59:59] <grawity> I used to use the archzfs repo packages, which are version-pinned
[15:00:09] <Namarrgon> by the time 5.16 is LTS there will be patches for it
[15:00:18] <grawity> they're DKMS but have dependencies on specific kernel versions, so pacman literally refuses to upgrade
[15:00:29] <carbolymer> kyentei: not using ZFS, but that was one of the reasons I went with BTFS, since I wasn't able to find stable low-effort ZFS configuration in Arch; also hardware requirements for ZFS are higher
[15:00:30] *** Joins: nixpipe (~nixpipe@net-5-94-233-225.cust.vodafonedsl.it)
[15:00:42] <grawity> and I kind of agree that if you want ZFS, you *probably* want the LTS kernel anywy
[15:00:51] <kyentei> carbolymer: I'm using btrfs right now, and want to keep using btrfs for /, but want ZFS for /home.
[15:01:18] <carbolymer> kyentei: why? I'm just curious
[15:01:19] <kyentei> grawity: Alright, fair enough.
[15:01:59] *** Joins: CyberShadow (vladimir@89.28.117.31)
[15:02:54] <kyentei> carbolymer: Because I favour ZFS over btrfs (personally). But considering the state, I want to be able to repair my system if something goes wrong. Having / not on ZFS would allow me to boot and repair without needing to use a live session. I still like btrfs for its compression and seems like a generally good filesystem for a laptop ssd
[15:04:01] <kyentei> Namarrgon: you mean to say that 5.16 would be a "regular" kernel first before getting LTS status? So linux-lts isn't bumped to it immidiately when it is released?
[15:04:53] *** Joins: _schrotti (~schrotti@2003:a:b02:f201:f093:3052:a043:1ade)
[15:05:28] <carbolymer> kyentei: ok, so what benefit give you ZFS over btrfs?
[15:06:22] <Namarrgon> kyentei: on arch that is how it usually turns out, but there's no policy
[15:07:31] <Namarrgon> i.e. there's plenty of time for the zfs projects to patch in support before a kernel is adopted as "linux-lts"

[15:09:51] <kyentei> carbolymer: syncing encrypted snapshots to a back-up server, having them be incremental without being readable on the destination host.
[15:10:12] <kyentei> carbolymer: and using zvols as raw "images" for vms, with instant snapshot capability
[15:10:40] <carbolymer> kyentei: that's cool, I guess I never needed that
[15:11:39] <grawity> aren't zvols the same thing as nocow files in btrfs
[15:12:02] <kyentei> I suppose they can be used for a similar purpose, but they're not the same thing
[15:12:36] <grawity> yeah but they give the same result, don't they – no COW (until snapshotted), no checksums (unless I missed something about zvols)

[15:13:50] <kyentei> Yeah, so that's what I am doing now for vms. But I'd rather use ZFS for that purpose, especially when combined with encryption for /home and the whole snapshot sending.

[19:53:02] <spagoote> addons are: decentraleyes, i dont care about cookies, ublock origin, canvas blocker, enhancer for youtube, cookie autodelete
[19:53:27] <kib> "I one day removed all youtube cookies and site data" this is the cause. Not the addons.
[19:53:48] <kib> this is expected behaviour unless you've signed to your youtube account
[19:53:57] <spagoote> kib: I'm pretty stupid but not that stupid. AFTER deleting site data & cookies I play 15 videos I like -> no recommendations
[19:54:06] <Edu4rdSHL> People trying to get privacy but still wanting that they're tracked and "good recommendations" are offered

[21:30:37] <Malinux> Hi. I have an iPod classic 6th generation. I use rhythombox to transfer mp3's to it by dragging the files to the iPod icon in rhythmbox. So far so good. However, when I unmount the iPod, the songs isn't showing up within the iPod. Though, when I look inside the iPod in nautilus, I find that songs are put into the root folder of the iPod, rather than in the iPod_Control/Music folder
[21:31:20] <kib> perhaps the ipod is not recognising the format of the song? have you tried using other formats which are older?

[21:37:41] <vd> thank you
[21:37:47] <kib> Mysterytrain, there's other factors that might have an impact on ipod being able to read the music file too, bitrate for exapmle. 
[21:37:47] <MacGyver> vd: If you already use NetworkManager, you can automate most of it away with https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NetworkManager#Sharing_internet_connection_over_Ethernet

[21:38:42] <MacGyver> vd: You *could* also *attempt* bridging, but since a wireless device is involved the odds of that working are against you.
[21:40:42] <Malinux> kib: no, haven't tried, though the iPod does support mp3 files :) I already uses mp3 with the device
[21:41:03] <kib> have you tried reducing the bitrate of the files then?
[21:41:21] <MacGyver> It honestly sound like they're just not ending up in the right place on the iPod?
[21:41:21] <Malinux> no, though the one I tries to transfer is 192Kbps
[21:41:29] <Malinux> MacGyver: that's what I think too
[21:41:56] <vd> MacGyver I tried to enslave them but indeed wlan0 didn't accept it
[21:41:57] <Malinux> as those that was transfered with ubuntu, also mp3-files, playes flawlessy, though, they show up in another location
[21:42:11] <MacGyver> Before going into all kinds of file format (in)compatibilities, figure out why they're showing up where they are.

[21:42:26] <Malinux> I am asking the rhythmbox ppl now, though, not many on their irc-channel, so might take a while to get an answer, but in the meantime I can dig further :)

[21:52:10] <Malinux> so it's something with either rhythmbox or something seomthiing in arch, that makes it put the files somwehere else
[21:52:23] <Malinux> It's mounted the same way in Ubuntu, and is a /dev/sdX device here as well
[21:53:11] <grawity> iPods are slightly weird, but *by default* they're a normal Mass Storage device
[21:53:23] <grawity> at least the pre-fancy-pants-touchscreen ones that I've had
[21:53:41] <MacGyver> My guess is that rhythmbox can be configured with a path.
[21:53:52] <MacGyver> "If this device, put it in this folder relative to the root of the device".
[21:53:58] <grawity> rhythmbox should be detecting them from udisks, I think
[21:54:12] <grawity> they do require libgpod or something similar to actually build the music DB file
[21:54:24] <grawity> i.e. they won't care about your random .mp3's dropped into the storage
[21:54:52] <MacGyver> Right but if you're using rhythmbox to transfer to the iPod, I assume iPod support is turned on and the rhythmbox wiki page implies you can't unless you have libgpod installed.
[21:54:56] <MacGyver> Might be worth checking though.

[21:59:12] <Malinux> I've tried gtk-pod or what it's called, but I ran in to some issues. Can't remember what those was, but It's easy to use rhythmbox so I stick with that :)
[21:59:25] <grawity> maybe I didn't? I remember at some point I rooted it and installed rockbox (which *does* accept any random .mp3's dropped into the storage), so I guess I did that before actually switching to Linux
[21:59:52] <MacGyver> Malinux: Oh.
[21:59:56] <MacGyver> Malinux: Install libgpod.
