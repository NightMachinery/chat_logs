[00:25:42] <paulo_> hi
[00:25:54] <paulo_> in my country, coca-cola is shortened to coke
[00:26:01] <paulo_> without the drug connotatations
[00:26:13] <paulo_> like "I'm craving for some coke."
[00:26:24] <paulo_> do you also do that in American English?
[00:26:32] <hoglahoo> yes
[00:26:56] <mdogg> Yes.  
[00:27:01] <hoglahoo> which English is coca-cola shortened to coke in your country?
[00:27:48] <paulo_> philippine
[00:27:58] <paulo_> probably more common than I think it is
[00:27:59] <hoglahoo> I see
[00:30:56] <darsie> I think if you say 'a coke' it's less ambigous.
[00:31:11] <mdogg> Though (at least in America) a person wouldn't say, "I'm craving for some Coke."  They would say, "I'm craving a Coke."  If somebody used 'some' instead of 'a', the inference would be they are craving cocaine. 
[00:31:49] <mdogg> Or they'd say, "I could go for a Coke."  or "I could sure use a Coke."
[00:32:45] <mdogg> But if you replace 'a' with 'some' then the drug is implied.
[00:33:47] <hoglahoo> agreed, assuming it's coming from an adult, anyway
[00:35:32] <mdogg> Well, I don't see how age would change anything.

[00:37:03] <mdogg> Anyone who wants the beverage and says "some" instead of "a" just needs to be educated about the difference.
[00:41:01] <mdogg> Even in the plural form you wouldn't use "some".  In a restaurant you might go to the waiter and say, "I'd like to order Cokes for everybody at my table."  Not 'some Cokes' and not 'some Coke'.

[00:42:10] <hoglahoo> if I am pouring Coke for someone from a 2-liter or a fountain, someone might come up to me with a glass in hand and ask for some Coke
[00:42:30] <hoglahoo> maybe this is what I was subconsciously referencing when I imagined a kid asking for some Coke
[00:43:34] <anrom> Do you see a lot of toddlers snorting cocaine?
[00:44:33] <TimMc> No, they're very sneaky about it.
[00:44:41] <mdogg> hoglahoo: Actually - that isa nice example.
[00:44:47] <mdogg> Well done with that one.

[08:59:55] <NewB> can you use "blonde" for a guy?
[09:08:52] <twb> pussipupu: blond/blonde is about the last remaining noun in english that inflects for gender
[09:08:56] <twb> er adjective
[09:09:12] <NewB> is it?
[09:09:40] <twb> NewB: yes but there's a general trend to not realize and just use "blonde" for both grammatical genders
[09:10:16] <NewB> I would actually think it's weird to call a guy a blonde
[09:10:21] <pussipupu> it often and increasingly doesn't though

[09:11:21] <twb> I was like "how the hell is alec baldwin black"

[09:17:01] <twb> I generally wouldn't use those words at all
[09:17:47] <twb> I lost my temper entirely when I discovered that black hair is "brunette" under that nomenclature
[09:18:13] <twb> Phrase of the day: "measure twice, cut once"
[09:18:54] <pussipupu> people do call men brunette
[09:32:44] <NewB> really? I thought it was a strictly female word 
[09:32:57] <NewB> also thought brunette means brown hair not black
[09:34:06] <twb> NewB: nope
[09:34:27] <twb> Or rather: they have no separate word for black-haired
[09:34:37] <twb> " 2. (of a person) having brown or black hair and, often, dark eyes and darkish or olive skin."
[09:35:04] <NewB> I see
[09:35:23] <NewB> so anyone who's not blonde or black

[21:58:01] <m1dnight> What do you do if you have an abbreviation that is the same for singular and plural?
[21:58:26] <m1dnight> I have "Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)", but I sometimes use "Cyber-Physical System (CPS)" too.
[22:00:08] <mdogg> If you need to distinguish between many systems and a single system, I would just write it out rather than abbreviate.  
[22:01:01] <mdogg> Or, you could say that you work with CPS and are having trouble with a CPS.  (The a denotes a single unit)

[22:09:05] <m1dnight> Yeah, I did the latter, but my advisor said that's confusing.

[22:29:13] <mdogg> It's best to write it out if you really need to distinguish between singular and plural.  But you could add an 's' like you would with ATM.  "I had to go to three different ATMs to find one that wouldn't charge a fee."
[22:30:03] <mdogg> Adding an 's' to CPS (because it ends in 'S') doesn't really look right to me, though.
