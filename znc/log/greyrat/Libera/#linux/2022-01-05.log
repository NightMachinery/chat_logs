[02:08:30] <mattf> it is not my first fork bomb
[02:08:38] <mattf> i do something like this like 2 times per month
[02:08:42] <hexnewbie> mattf: pkill with the right regex in an infinite loop has a chance
[02:08:42] <mattf> im stupid
[02:08:43] <firepup> just killall ?
[02:08:45] <Dagmar> Okay so at some point you're going to learn not to do this
[02:08:49] <s33ker> hexnewbie i found a way to run expect inside a bash script what i want instead of calling file ./test which holds just 'jupyter server pasword' to write a line directly in the script

[05:38:10] <draeath> best way is via your package manager, but if you need to free space before you can do it, *carefully* `echo '' > /boot/the/old/file` to truncate it, see if it lets you do that. Then use your package manager to properly remove it.

[05:59:46] <rascul> just works or Just Works?
[05:59:50] <draeath> and to be honest, if you haven't been paying attention to Windows Land, it's not been a lot better for the last few years since they punted their QA. Seems nearly every patch tuesday is a crapshoot.

[06:08:40] <draeath> but i do that like twice a year, hardly a pro
[06:08:49] <Khaytsus> Yeah, I used a few before After Shot and they all kind of behaved similarly..  Almost like a photo editor, but all layers of course.  Dark Table feels like you're building plumbing.
[06:09:15] <draeath> TBH if it had a node graph editor i'd prefer that over the whole collections & sidecar thing they have going on
[06:09:23] <tm512> I'm considering whether I want to set up LVM on this new HDD, or if I just want to put ext4 on it directly and call it a day. this HDD is 3TB which is over double the amount of data I've accrued over the last decade, so it seems unlikely that I'll be needing LVM's functionality of pooling together multiple physical disks
[06:09:33] <draeath> pipeline style workflows <3
[06:09:44] <Khaytsus> I can cull, do some quick exposure and crop/rotations on a few hours of shots pretty quick in After Shot..  never could do that in Dark Table, it feels exceptionally labored.
[06:10:24] <draeath> tm512, i wouldn't think lvm would do much for you there, keep it simple and use ext4 or XFS or something directly. ZFS maybe if you are feeling adventurous.
[06:10:33] <Khaytsus> It feels like you ahve to do a dozen things to every image..  I dunno, I should give it another shot sometime.
[06:10:52] <Khaytsus> Someday After Shot is going to go away... it's already fading pretty hard, been very few updates the last 5+ years
[06:11:37] <tm512> also with this thing I'm learning how not-quiet enterprise HDDs are

[06:12:49] <Khaytsus> Not just LVM, with anything..  JBOD is a no for me
[06:13:09] <tm512> Khaytsus: I'm keeping backups on an external, I just had a JBOD fail yesterday, that's why I'm getting this 3TB set up

[06:15:21] <Khaytsus> Sure
[06:17:41] <tm512> is LUKS tied to LVM? I'm contemplating maybe having /home encrypted since hardware AES acceleration makes it relatively transparent, but it's a desktop so the chances of it being stolen are pretty low

[06:22:24] <tm512> rockworld: the hashbang line is for... yeah. and it is necessary if you want to be able to execute it like any other executable
[06:22:43] <Khaytsus> If you make it #!/bin/sh and then run it with bash script.sh of course it's going to execute under bash...  but if you ./script.sh it'll use sh
[06:22:55] <tm512> excluding it means you'll have to call like: bash script.sh instead of being able to do ./script.sh
[06:22:58] <rockworld> yes I want it to be .sh
[06:23:04] <rockworld> so I need to add #!/bin/bash
[06:23:06] <rockworld> right ?
[06:23:16] <Khaytsus> If it's a bash script, sure
[06:23:25] <tm512> I would recommend #!/usr/bin/env bash

[07:15:23] <draeath> special string notation that says 'keep yer mitts off it, what i typed here is what i want you to read' ?
[07:15:50] <draeath> bparker, i'm thinking of a string formatted like so:    r'whatever is in here is handled directly EXCEPT for another single quote'
[07:16:04] <bparker> oh
[07:16:12] <bparker> yea that's not barewords
[07:16:17] <draeath> i pretty much only ever use them for regex module patterns tbh
[07:16:22] <bparker> barewords means a random string can actually be evaluated
[07:16:28] <draeath> just means i don't have to escape so much

[07:17:21] <rascul> $'apple sauce'
[07:17:44] <draeath> from the python lexical doc thingy:    Both string and bytes literals may optionally be prefixed with a letter 'r' or 'R'; such strings are called raw strings and treat backslashes as literal characters. As a result, in string literals, '\U' and '\u' escapes in raw strings are not treated specially. Given that Python 2.x’s raw unicode literals behave differently than Python 3.x’s the 'ur' syntax is not supported.

[07:19:11] <bparker> for some godforsaken reason
[07:19:38] <draeath> bash can do it all, just sometimes it's clunky. Like screwing with IFS for example.
[07:19:42] <draeath> powerful, but, uh, yea.
[07:19:48] <bparker> you can even define your own suffixes for numbers to specify the type
[07:19:53] <bparker> like how 1ULL is unsigned long long

[08:36:41] <Jari--> yeah, this pretty much speeded up the development of the present X

[12:23:35] <hexnewbie> tm512: Very few disk formats put the metadata at the end, so writing to a larger drive is possible 99% of the time. Exceptions: GPT has a backup partition table at the end, which needs to be ‘fixed’ after copying. MD RAID metadata 0.90 and 1.0 are at the end, so will break when imaged and copied to a larger disk
[12:23:55] <hexnewbie> GPT works fine if you don't fix it, by the way, you just should

[15:50:04] <mort> according to tcptraceroute, the first hop is the IP address of the destination
[15:50:19] <mort> which sounds weird but idk

[15:51:22] <peetaur> mort: what hops do you expect in between? traceroutes use things like changing the TTL by 1 to see at what point it gets rejected from expiry...so it only shows you places that change and use the TTL (not switches in normal configuration for example)
[15:51:58] <Affliction> If we're trying google, presumably there'd be at least 1 hop that decrements the TTL along the path
[15:52:01] <mort> peetaur: expected things like routers and firewalls maybe

[16:52:17] <peetaur> Khaytsus: the performance thing? not by kernel quirks code...  if you trim it would have an IO stall like 1 second per GB you trim. So if you eg. lvremove a 100 GB volume, it would take 100s to do any IO so everything else times out. Resizing it -1GB, sleep 1s, repeat, etc. until it's gone would mean lots of 1s stalls...which was better but still obviously terrible.
[16:52:37] <Khaytsus> Datsun Z80.  Worth $800 in the 90s, worth $30k today.  heh
[16:53:06] <peetaur> m017 is what it has now....the one that fixed it (trim is parallel or fast so no IO effect is noticeable)

[17:51:13] <tirnanog> for curl to report the error that it did implies ECONNREFUSED which, in most cases, implies an explicit TCP RST packet having been received. should that be the case (it can be determined one way or another with tcpdump), and given the confirmed absence of OUTPUT chain filtering, no amount of fiddling with the host that originated the request is likely to change anything.

[17:59:59] <jim> visualinfo, with partitions, you make partitions using a partition tool, format them with a filesystem directly, and mount the partition with the filesystem. with LVM, instead of putting filesystems in partitions directly, you put 'LVM physical volumes' in partitions, then you make a 'volume group' (which is just a list of physical volumes), and put physical volumes in the volume groups, then you can make 'logical volumes', and these are what you would
[17:59:59] <jim> format and mount, and they got allocated from a volume group.

[18:47:43] <tirnanog> horseface: note that it's not necessarily useful to specify from 10.42.0.0/24. DHCPDISCOVER packets for a host that has not yet been granted an address will appear to originate from 0.0.0.0. in any case, a quick glance at the man page shows that the grammar you are presently using does not support the PORT/PROTOCOL shorthand, so that would explain why it isn't accepted.

[18:51:18] <tirnanog> horseface: I think that you might as well just allow udp/67 and done. ufw seems too limited to be any more precise about it and 0.0.0.0 would be implied by not specifying it at all.

[20:31:00] <FlorianBad> jim: yeah. Here's what I've done:   1. Hacked a ChromeBox using mrchromebox.tech scripts to allow it to boot something else than ChromeOS (UEFI-64 only). That worked, so I booted the latest Ubuntu on a USB drive. That worked.

[20:31:19] <FlorianBad> 2. I used dd to copy the original 256GB NVMe of Chrome stuff to a new one of 1TB
[20:31:20] <petaflot> tirnanog: I rebooted, tried to re-emerge docker and one kernel optionn I'm having a problem with is HUGETLB_PAGE ; make menuconfig says it's [=n] but not how to set it!
[20:32:34] <FlorianBad> 3. I used fdisk to add some partitions in the unused remaining space, and as I wrote with fdisk it also cleaned up (supposedly / it seems) the partition table that was probably a bit messed up with dd.

[20:34:20] <petaflot> tirnanog: I don't know who's in charge of this "mess" but IMHO it should be made somewhat clearer...
[20:34:29] * petaflot is compiling kernel again
[20:34:29] <jim> yeah, if you dded the filesystem on the partition, they probably do
[20:34:31] <FlorianBad> but, I did that AFTER boot, so they booted with the same UUID, maybe I should try to reboot with only the new disk in?

[20:37:35] <tirnanog> petaflot: kernel configuration isn't designed to be user-friendly and likely never will be. you either learn the ropes or end up using a -bin kernel.
[20:37:38] <jim> also, do you want to try original debian?
[20:38:01] <jim> (I always ask that question :)

[20:39:12] <tirnanog> petaflot: if you ask a kernel developer, they'll cite it as a vendor problem. if you ask a vendor such as gentoo, they'll just (fairly) say to use a pre-built kernel. if you think it's easy to improve the UX, try going about it (it actually isn't).
[20:39:34] <FlorianBad> jim: I ASSUMED that the reason why the Ubuntu installer can't see any partition is the same as why parted shows this overlap warning, but I actually don't know for sure
[20:39:48] <jim> ok so "no personal files, or at least you don't need any personal files that were there", yes?
[20:39:54] <petaflot> tirnanog: it's somewhat like when installing pyton packages... you do stuff like "import Xyz" but before it's required to do "pip install xyz". IMHO this is uncessary confusion
[20:40:07] <jim> how large is the new drive?

[20:40:53] <FlorianBad> jim, regarding that 1TB NVMe yes, anything can be lost. But of course at the end of the day I will need to copy back everything from the 256GB via USB, which will take another 3h, only to recreate these Linux parttions in the extra space

[20:41:57] <jim> ok
[20:42:00] <tirnanog> petaflot: also, the kconfig checks performed by ebuilds are advisory in nature. you might not need HUGETLBFS at all but it's effectively signalling that not all docker features will necessarily work perfectly if any of the options are missed.
[20:42:13] <tirnanog> petaflot: in any case, the -bin kernel would cover them.
[20:42:16] <petaflot> tirnanog: it _totally_ applies here. 1) because a bin kernel can't possibly have all options enabled. 2) I'm really not in a mood to argue aout this ATM
[20:42:18] <FlorianBad> jim: check out the last photo: https://florianbador.com/pub/202201-chromebox-hack/

[20:43:00] <tirnanog> petaflot: it kind of doesn't, though. it's a repackaged fedora kernel and will cover the vast majority - if not all - kconfig checks performed by all ebuilds in the repo.
[20:43:15] <jim> also, there are some advantages to using LVM, do you want to try that?
[20:43:30] <tirnanog> petaflot: you can choose not to use it, but it then seems disingenuous to complain that it's too hard.
[20:43:46] <FlorianBad> jim: there is wifi, but not really room to put a disk instead, it's small format

[20:44:50] <FlorianBad> I do
[20:44:52] <tirnanog> petaflot: on the other thand, if you think it can be made easier, do it. implement something. for example, try to convince the kernel developers that indirect Kconfig deps shoudl be revealed in menuconfig (or implement it).
[20:45:38] <tirnanog> petaflot: that would actually be a tangible benefit for people rolling their own kernels.
[20:45:50] <FlorianBad> jim: this is what the whole thing looks like. The drive inside is my new 1TB, the one I point my finger at is the original 256GB via usb  https://florianbador.com/pub/202201-chromebox-hack/20220105_091427.jpg

[21:18:19] <FlorianBad> mrfb: https://florianbador.com/pub/202201-chromebox-hack/   This is the ChromeBox that I'm trying to mix up with some linux systems. I cloned (w/ dd) original NVMe (256GB) to a new one (1TB). Then I used fdisk to add new partitions in the unused remaining space which I plan to use for Linux.
[21:18:21] <FlorianBad> The w of fdisk also supposedly cleaned up the incorrect paritioning dd created. But then parted shows overlapping parittions (which are nowhere to be seen if you look at the sector numbers) and the installers of both Ubuntu and Debian cannot see any parittion.

[21:22:06] <FlorianBad> ChromeOS is likely to be very picky about the way these parittions are setup. I strongly doubt you could just move them around, even if you put back the same UUIDs

[22:28:40] <xx> why?
[22:29:40] <BCMM> well, do you have permissions in that directory?
[22:29:48] <FlorianBad> Of course another solution would be to use that second M.2 slot that the wifi/bluetooth adapter uses, that way I'd have one drive for ChromeOS (the original) and one for Linux. But if I do that I'll need a USB wifi+bluetooth, and also it doesn't quite fit that M.2, there's no screw, etc. Not even sure that would work because maybe the bandwidth of
[22:29:49] <FlorianBad> that M.2 would be different?
[22:30:06] <jim> FlorianBad, I would think you could try deleting the partitions you wanted to reserve for debian first, leaving the chromeos one

[23:09:00] <msiism> [itchyjunk]: I was meaning to say, among other things, that you need to think of find(1) as a primitive programming language for running commands on selections of files.

[23:10:38] <msiism> [itchyjunk]: And, yes, it's all an intimidating pile of living spaghetti.
[23:10:49] <FlorianBad> Worst case scenario, since there are two M.2 slots, (one for drive and a small one for wifi/bluetooth) do you think the smaller one might handle the same speed? (meaning that it's just the physical format that's different) Because if so then I can put an NVMe extension and use USB instead for wifi+bluetooth
[23:11:03] <FlorianBad> would lspci or lshw tell me about this?
[23:11:08] <[itchyjunk]> Hmm a single command as a primitive programming language. now that's an interesting concept.
[23:11:17] <msiism> [itchyjunk]: You can't approach it with logic. You just need to get a feel for it. :P
[23:11:53] <jim> [itchyjunk], yeah, after the starting directories, find expects an "expression" which can be as complex or as simple as you want
[23:13:13] <koala_man> [itchyjunk]: what does "compound command" mean in this case? This term has a specific meaning in bourne shells, and find -exec definitely does not support while loops and such

[23:17:58] <koala_man> shell compound commands are things like while/if/case/()/(())/etc, essentially any structure that does not use or simulate execve style execution the way a "simple command" does
