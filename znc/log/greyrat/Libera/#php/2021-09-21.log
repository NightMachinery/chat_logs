[01:50:02] <snedd> lantech19446: Do you have wsl2 setup on your windows machine? I believe this will allow you to install php into a linux distro like ubuntu and your windows vscode can use it like normal

[01:55:35] <lantech19446> the shear volume of files contained for php is impressive

[02:18:26] <snedd> Sorry I am not sure what you mean by extracting anything. Was under the impression once you are in your linux subsystem you can then proceed to install PHP8 using the apt install commands
[02:23:05] <__adrian> (yes)
[02:24:15] <lantech19446> no apt install doesn't work on WSL I tried that first so I wound up downloading the tarball and all i had to do was extract it and it seems to have installed
[02:24:46] <__adrian> suggest making sure you've got the process down
[02:24:53] <__adrian> first, wsl2 (not wsl)
[02:25:11] <__adrian> second, you need to make a machine first - recommend the default ubuntu image.
[02:25:20] <__adrian> from _there_, you'd install php via apt
[02:27:10] <lantech19446> all it says in add features is windows subsystem for linux there's no version information for it I'm on server2k19 and it's up to date so I probably do have 2.

[02:49:46] <snedd> Hmm, reading an article from 2019 stating 18945 or higher

[02:55:32] <snedd> lantech19446: If that version cannot be updated, I'm believe wsl2 cannot be an option sadly. Sorry I don't have any experience with windows server. As far as I am aware your options are what you originally were trying with PHP 8 on Windows Server, or perhaps a docker setup. Hopefully someone here can provide more advice
[02:56:46] <lantech19446> my use for it is kind of limited because I know server as well as I know linux I work on both and have my own red hat server that acts as a web server and test bed so I get to do the fun stuff when I work on my own stuff

[06:03:55] <titusbc123> hello, I am been trying all day to figure irc and find an active channel with php programmers.  Have I landed in an active chat room?
[06:05:44] <__adrian> welcome :) please /msg php-bot guidelines  and feel free to ask your questions
[06:06:50] <titusbc123> ok I will type in that command slash msg php-bot ... if that is what you are instructing
[06:07:16] <__adrian> yes indeed - but you shouldn't find anything too surprising :)
[06:15:05] <titusbc123> I am getting back into php and mysql and not programming for many years.  I see things have changed with MySQLi... I am not at my computer now to paste my code.  I found many example to echo the rows of an mysqli query with a while loop.  What I need I think is something like a For loop because I need to restrict the row output to about 3 not all 3
[06:15:05] <titusbc123> 0 that are found.  I hope do do something like $row[$i] where $i is the for loop count.
[06:16:57] <__adrian> 2 things there
[06:17:24] <__adrian> (1) mysqli is _iterable_, meaning you can simply loop over the results with a foreach().
[06:17:52] <__adrian> (2) unless you have legacy code to support, strongly recommend you at least conside PDO.
[06:18:09] <__adrian> https://phpdelusions.net/pdo
[06:18:59] <__adrian> well, i'll amend that. even if you have legacy code to support, you should definitely at least know how to use pdo.

[07:56:50] <__adrian> hi
[08:01:19] <Rockwood> can i ask basic question about json data?
[08:01:20] <Rockwood> here
[08:02:03] <Rockwood> https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-doprrk?file=src%2Fdata.json my structure looks wrong?
[08:02:27] <__adrian> how do you mean?
[08:03:01] <nebx_co> yeah... i ran it through a linter and it "valid"
[08:03:27] <__adrian> Rockwood: there are tools like  https://jsonlint.com/  that can answer "is this valid"
[08:03:35] *** Quits: rawb (~rawb@user/rawb) (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[08:03:43] <Rockwood> its valid
[08:03:48] <__adrian> yes, we know
[08:03:51] <Rockwood> but problem is
[08:04:11] <Rockwood> logically its need lots of loops
[08:04:31] <Rockwood> that why i am thinking is correct way?
[08:04:39] <Rockwood> i am confuse
[08:04:50] <Rockwood> actually i am thinking
[08:04:55] <__adrian> json doesn't need loops at all. your code might. looks like you're writing javascript, though, so that would be a better channel to ask on
[08:05:21] <Rockwood> yeah this is JS
[08:05:34] <Rockwood> but logic could be similar i think
[08:05:48] <Rockwood> its react actually
[08:06:06] <Rockwood> i wanna display this json just
[08:06:12] <__adrian> you should ask on a javascript or react channel then (likely a js channel)
[08:06:57] <Rockwood> suppose in php i wanna show elements of this json then?

[08:07:34] <__adrian> that seems a bit contrived. you'd decode it, and then probably print_r().
[08:07:47] <Rockwood> every children requires need loop
[08:07:51] <Rockwood> am right?
[08:08:00] <Rockwood> every children requires loop
[08:08:05] <nebx_co> here's a link to a solution -> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4731242/php-loop-through-json-array
[08:08:13] <__adrian> not if you're just displaying the data.
[08:08:14] <Byteflux> How would we know? Only you know how your data needs to be displayed.
[08:08:20] <__adrian> "show elements of json" doesn't seem like a real situation.
[08:08:30] <Byteflux> Do you have a real question?
[08:08:37] <__adrian> you'd more likely be needing to _use_ the data to populate a template, or similar.
[08:09:22] <__adrian> so yes, you'd need to ask a real question. and since you're writing this in react, a channel like ##javascript is more likely to be the place to ask that question.
[08:09:25] <Rockwood> sometime like
[08:09:39] <Rockwood> Byteflux, yes i am stuck that why i asking here
[08:09:54] <Rockwood> JS people are not good enough in logic wise
[08:09:56] <Rockwood> i noticed
[08:10:12] <Byteflux> That makes no sense. If you need a JS-specific answer, you should be asking in a JS channel.
[08:10:16] <Byteflux> They're more than capable.
[08:10:17] <Rockwood> they know only render stuffs
[08:10:28] <Byteflux> And it's a much larger channel, too.
[08:10:35] <__adrian> kinda doubt that's the problem. note that when asked "show elements of this json" we didn't have very useful answers either.
[08:10:46] <__adrian> well, you're talking about rendering.
[08:10:50] <Byteflux> I suspect the problem is you're not asking very good questions.
[08:10:59] <__adrian> "render" means set it up for display.
[08:11:04] <Rockwood> but there is not any __adrian Blondie101010
[08:11:26] <__adrian> ...and? that's normal
[08:11:29] <Rockwood> you are very awesome highly capable
[08:11:35] <__adrian> i'm not on _most_ channels, in fact.
[08:11:44] <Rockwood> they are but
[08:11:49] <__adrian> are you going to come here to ask me about car radio repair also?
[08:11:58] <Rockwood> lol
[08:12:01] <Rockwood> no
[08:12:04] <__adrian> i'm not on any channels about that.
[08:12:29] <Rockwood> you just on phpc too
[08:12:42] <__adrian> there are plenty of capable folks. figure out how to better explain your question, then be patient in waiting for an answer.
[08:13:01] <Rockwood> yeah you are correct
[08:13:26] <Rockwood> anyway thanks
[08:13:31] <nebx_co> that is good advice.. I have a question that i'll ask here tomorrow.  But I need to formulate my question well...
[08:13:48] <__adrian> general approach: you need to know the result you want to end up with. i.e., decide on the <html> markup you need and where you'd put variables in it.
[08:14:09] <__adrian> THEN, you can decide where loops nned to be and how you'd populate those values.
[08:14:20] <__adrian> but the specifics will all be js/react.
[08:14:42] <__adrian> welcome
[08:15:00] <Rockwood> yes i was bit confuse about approach
[08:15:18] <Rockwood> now i understand what i have to do
[08:15:23] <Rockwood> thanks gr8 man
[08:15:49] <__adrian> note the loops are not first  :)  the template(s) are. you might have many templates, with smaller templates in loops inside them.

[08:56:05] <titus123> is there a prefered past bin here?  I am not familiar with any of them so what is a good one to try right now?
[08:56:23] <__adrian> gist is good, 3v4l.org is good if you need to run code
[08:56:32] <__adrian> in general, "not pastebin.com" is fine

[09:25:53] <titus123> I have some php/myqli that outputs the rows ok using a while loop.  The issue is, I need to show a subset of the rows so I have been trying to use a for loop instead.  I am unable to find out to format an array to use in the FOR LOOP for this purpose.  My general code is at https://3v4l.org/9HF7B
[09:50:00] <TinoDidriksen> titus123, so either LIMIT the query or store as many rows as you want into an array while you're looping over them.

[09:56:23] <titus123> TinoDidriksen: thanks, is there no way to store them in some form of array and just access by an array row number? ... ie. the For Loop in my example code?  That way... if I needed to fetch the first 3, then perpaps a single row (ie the 6th row), etc.
[09:56:59] <titus123> I am used to the BASIC language where I could access any position in an array just by the number of it.
[09:57:10] <titus123> Arrays in php seem more complicated
[09:57:45] <TinoDidriksen> You can access an array like that, but you don't have one.
[09:58:46] <TinoDidriksen> So either make an array while looping over images, or just limit the query itself.
[09:58:57] <titus123> I tried several differnt ways to format the array... but none of them worked
[09:59:24] <titus123> would you mind showing me a way to make that array so I can use the for loop to access them by number?
[10:00:10] <titus123> or what if I just wanted to the 10th row like $row[9]
[10:00:25] <titus123> or the first one like $row[0]
[10:00:42] <TinoDidriksen> titus123, something like https://3v4l.org/WYkWO will build an array from the fetched images.
[10:00:44] <titus123> or in the loop like $row[$i]
[10:00:44] * TinoDidriksen -> bbl
[10:01:11] <titus123> I searched all day with google to find a solution and all end up showing a while loop
[10:02:35] <titus123> tinodidriksen: thanks for that example... looking now
[10:14:56] <titus123> tinodidriksen: I am starting to see how it is supposed to be set up, but I am getting array to string conversion error at this time:

[11:35:04] <AllenJB> PaddyF: Did you also adjust post_max_size? (File uploads are sent as POST data, so post_max_size must be equal to or larger than upload_max_filesize)

[11:36:48] <AllenJB> PaddyF: Check you've edited the right ini file by checking the top table of phpinfo() output - it lists the ini files read by PHP. Also make sure you've restarted Apache / PHP-FPM after making ini changes.

[21:19:00] <nebx_co> so I have a kinda 'newbie' question that i'm hoping someone can answer...  On this page, Example 2 -> https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.returning-values.php
[21:19:15] <nebx_co> What is this line doing
[21:19:15] <nebx_co> / Array destructuring will collect each member of the array individually
[21:19:16] <nebx_co> [$zero, $one, $two] = small_numbers();
[21:19:50] <Byteflux> It is unpacking the returned array into those variables.
[21:20:21] <nebx_co> ok so it's not 'assigning' the array to the function?  Which seems weird to me...
[21:20:32] <Byteflux> A shorter equivalent to: $result = small_numbers(); $zero = $result[0]; $one = $result[1]; $two = $result[2];
[21:20:58] <nebx_co> oooohhh alright that I kinda understand

[23:29:38] <iogue> well...then... the problem is:
[23:29:53] <iogue> sudo pecl search mcrypt
[23:30:01] <iogue> gives me this:
[23:30:18] <iogue> Notice: Trying to access array offset on value of type null in PEAR/Command/Remote.php on line 550
[23:31:01] *** Quits: impliednude (~impliednu@172.56.42.130) ()
[23:31:03] <__adrian> you should not be using mcrypt (nor any version of php where mcrypt exists)
[23:31:15] <__adrian> use openssl or libsodium
[23:31:29] <__adrian> mcrypt is dead and gone and good riddance
[23:31:42] <iogue> hummm... things evolved
[23:31:51] <__adrian> :)
[23:32:16] <__adrian> do you have ciphertext that you would need to migrate, or is this new work?
[23:32:22] <iogue> ok, I've got your point but is it the origin of the problem?
[23:32:43] <gastus> biberu: I wanted to have embedded images in memory when using phpmailer. I used tempfiles instead. There is also swiftmailer which probalby has from_string or such
[23:32:44] <__adrian> don't know. what php version are you working with?
[23:32:53] <Byteflux> How did you go about installing PHP and PECL on your Ubuntu system?
[23:33:40] <iogue> __adrian: 7.4.3
[23:33:50] <__adrian> then yes, that's the problem.
[23:33:56] <__adrian> mcrypt does not exist on 7.4
[23:34:56] <iogue> __adrian: but it is not installed. the error line was issued by pecl search
[23:36:07] <__adrian> if you want to find the specific error... then i'd say you'd have to look at the code. but i'd expect it's because there's no result. and in any case, installing will not work.
[23:36:21] <biberu> gastus: ah, thanks for answering
[23:37:10] <iogue> __adrian: pecl could just list nothing and I will be satisfied but it prints this error and than it prints the mcrypt packages
[23:37:28] <iogue> Package       Stable/(Latest) Local
[23:37:29] <iogue> mcrypt        1.0.4 (stable)        Bindings for the libmcrypt library
[23:37:31] <iogue> mcrypt_filter 0.1.0 (beta)          Applies mcrypt symmetric encryption using stream filters
[23:37:38] <__adrian> i agree that pecl shouldn't error
[23:37:43] <__adrian> but i couldn't answer why

[23:41:59] <Byteflux> Sounds like the PECL channel is broken or the `pecl` tool is outdated.
[23:42:24] <Sammitch> sounds like mcrypt sucks and no one should use it :3c
[23:42:52] <Byteflux> I get the same error with `pecl search xdebug` using Ondrej's PHP 7.4.23 package
[23:44:59] <iogue> Byteflux: yes... that's the point... pecl seems to be broken. It dosn't matter if you are searchin for mcrypt or not
[23:46:58] <iogue> the same problem happens if I search for libsodium

[23:48:42] <iogue> and I'v just installed php-pear hight now so if `pecl` is outdated than the official ubuntu 20.04 package has a problem
[23:49:49] <Sammitch> WFM in docker on php:7.4
[23:59:13] <Byteflux> I wouldn't use the official packages, but even Ondrej's package for 7.4 has the same issue so that won't fix it either :P
[23:59:30] <Byteflux> Also I think Ondrej actually does the official packages too >_>
