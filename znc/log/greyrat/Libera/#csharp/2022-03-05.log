[00:00:19] <smallvil_> is it possible to replace `this` inside of a constructor?   eg HardwareClass() : SoftwareClass { HardwareClass( HardwareContext context ) { this = context.CreateHardwareClass(); } };
[00:00:26] <Suchiman> GunArm: yes (IIRC)
[00:00:42] <Suchiman> smallvil_: no
[00:00:47] <Suchiman> smallvil_: unless it's a struct
[00:01:22] <smallvil_> so    struct HardwareClass() : SoftwareClass { HardwareClass( HardwareContext context ) { this = context.CreateHardwareClass(); } };       ?

[00:08:40] <jonp> smallvil_: try it; no.
[00:08:55] <jonp> you can assign to `this` in structs
[00:10:00] <smallvil_> ok
[00:11:54] <jonp> smallvil_: now, why do you want to assign to `this`?
[00:14:45] <lz_> wow i didn't know you could do this
[00:15:03] <jonp> lz_: it's part of the struct definite member assignment rules
[00:15:14] <jonp> it's an easy way to ensure they're all assigned.
[00:15:32] <jonp> that, and in order to make mutable fields work, `this` is always passed implicitly by reference

Ideally the API would look something like Register("foocmd", RunFoo); where RunFoo is something like public static void RunFoo(A? a = default, B? b = default); If I define Register using multiple arity overloads of Action it tells me that that RunFoo example isn't
[07:11:59] <wroathe> compatible with any of the overloads, and I don't quite get that but...
[07:12:12] <wroathe> The other option would be if there were some kind of type that represented "any function"

[12:02:54] <MatthiasVance> Ahh
[12:03:16] <MatthiasVance> I thought from your question that you were new to this but it seems you already have a good grasp :D
[12:03:45] <smallville7123> so the view may report an invalid position value in comparison to the actual UI view's tracked position in the tree
[12:04:22] <smallville7123> especially if the UI moves the view
[12:05:03] <smallville7123> eg the Xamarin.Forms.View may report 0x0 while the UI.View reports 200x500
[12:06:02] <smallville7123> additionally if it extends View users may expect the UI to be compatible with Xamarin.Forms, such as Xamarin.Forms.Button
[12:06:19] <smallville7123> which it is currently not
[12:07:25] <smallville7123> additionally it will just lead to "bugs" that users expect because it extends from Xamarin.Forms.View
[12:07:43] <smallville7123> such as "the Xamarin.Forms.View may report 0x0 while the UI.View reports 200x500"
[12:08:54] <smallville7123> anyway
[12:09:01] <smallville7123> how do i get it to work in XAML

[19:46:06] <wroathe> Hey guys, same question as last night. How would I go about defining a Register function that can accept multiple different methods of varying numbers and types of parameters: https://dotnetfiddle.net/0BiKJU
[19:49:30] <wroathe> Maybe a little clearer: https://dotnetfiddle.net/JLZKw3
[19:49:42] <wroathe> How can I get the compiler to stop complaining on 44-46?
[19:52:47] <lz_> registry.Register("do-a-thing", new Action<Foo, Bar, CancellationToken>(DoAThing));
[19:53:31] <wroathe> Ah, sorry, I should have specified that I'm hoping to be able to make the compiler infer those types at the call site
[19:53:42] <wroathe> If that's possible
[19:53:53] <lz_> i don't know if that's possible, but i guess not
[19:54:43] <xb0o2> Alternatively: registry.Register<Foo, Bar>("do-a-thing", DoAThing);
[19:55:21] <wroathe> Yeah, xb0o2, that's exactly what I'm doing in the real code I've got in place
[19:55:29] <wroathe> But I'm hoping to try to get the compiler to meet me halfway on these types
[20:06:07] <wroathe> Ah, so this fundamentally isn't going to work: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6229131/why-cant-c-sharp-infer-type-from-this-seemingly-simple-obvious-case
[20:08:09] <Suchiman> wroathe: if you're using the most recent C# compiler, then it will work

[20:15:17] <wroathe> Suchiman: Interesting. It's taking me a second to digest what I'm seeing here
[20:17:15] <wroathe> So that's this bit: "lambdas and method groups have a natural delegate type"?
[20:21:03] <Suchiman> wroathe: yes
[20:23:34] <Suchiman> wroathe: that means that if a Method is being used like a value and there's no desired target type given, it will give the method a natural delegate type from System.Action or System.Func

[23:52:03] <bomb> yeah, it's one of those
[23:52:29] <lz_> did he mention something that doesn't fit your narrative?
[23:53:11] <bomb> I'm talking nothing but reality, because I don't support any of the sides.
[23:53:47] <lz_> you obviously do, otherwise you wouldn't be offended by a video about logistics :D
[23:54:15] <bomb> it's not about logistics, at 7:15 he started glorifying the Ukrainian resistance
[23:54:21] <bomb> s/not/not only/
[23:55:10] <lz_> "fierce resistance" omg glorifying
[23:55:45] <bomb> also he doesn't mention the first arrived are Chechen militia, and Belarus saboteurs
[23:57:38] <cloudbender> It's 2022, and it's Europe; there was no need for Russia (er, I mean Putin) to attack.
[23:57:57] <cloudbender> Non of this falls on the Russian People, in my mind.
[23:58:52] <bomb> do you mean "it's Europe, we'll hurt each other anyway", or "it's Europe, it doesn't deserved to be attacked like kebabs"?
[23:59:41] <cloudbender> No, I mean it's Eorpoe, and there could have been negotiations versus war.
[23:59:58] <lz_> apparently the same guy dated all women in NYC: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeCi4CSqtzw
