[03:30:23] <vifon> find-file-noselect is a "silent" version I presume most things use internally.  One way or another.  Or maybe not, that's just my assumption.
[03:32:09] <sturm_> my use case is that I might initially open a file deep in a codebase via some kind of search, but then want to modify a sibling file by running "C-x f".
[03:32:42] <vifon> With some unrelated 3rd file being open at the time?
[03:32:55] <sturm_> hmm, though I suppose if I haven't switched buffers, then I'm already in the right place...
[03:33:02] <vifon> Exactly.
[03:33:03] <sturm_> yes
[03:33:17] <vifon> Do you use embark?
[03:33:18] <sturm_> or say I switch to Magit status
[03:33:33] <sturm_> no, but I'll look that up too, thanks
[03:33:45] <vifon> Let me check something real quick…

[03:35:05] <vifon> Yeah, first selecting something from recentf (consult-recent-file in my case), then removing the last part and calling embark -> C-x C-f gets me quite close.  But that might be a mouthful for you.
[03:35:38] <vifon> Do you use any project-aware versions of find-file?
[03:36:08] <vifon> project-find-file with selectrum can be really powerful, especially with orderless on top.
[03:36:20] <sturm_> not at the moment - on my list to try some things out. Ok, thanks
[03:36:31] <vifon> And yes, definitely try embark, it's a hidden gem.  https://karthinks.com/software/fifteen-ways-to-use-embark/
[03:36:51] <vifon> (read up the manual first to get the basic concept)
[03:36:54] <sturm_> vifon: thanks for the recommendations - sounds useful
[03:37:26] <vifon> What do you use for your completion right now?  Helm?  Ivy?
[03:38:03] <sturm_> vifon: I got fed up with not having helm tuned right for me and switched it off, so nothing at the moment. Any hot tips?
[03:38:11] <vifon> I highly recommend the selectrum+orderless+marginalia+embark stack.  It's everything I wanted it to be.
[03:38:31] *** Quits: zebrag (~chris@user/zebrag) (Remote host closed the connection)
[03:38:32] <sturm_> great, thanks
[03:38:33] <vifon> I think I've used all the major ones at some point and this setup is my favorite so far.
[03:38:53] <vifon> sturm_: Feel free to borrow.  https://github.com/vifon/emacs-config/blob/master/emacs.d/vifon/my-completing-read.el
[03:39:07] <sturm_> thanks!
[03:40:28] <tamwile> vifon: i'm using selectrum, but just out of curiosity, did you make a comparison with vertico ?
[03:40:37] *** Joins: chenqisu1 (~xirndc@183.217.203.91)
[03:41:16] <vifon> No, I merely took a glance at it.  Looked like a "more lightweight selectrum", except selectrum is already damn lightweight compared to all the old ones.
[03:41:53] *** Joins: zebrag (~chris@user/zebrag)
[03:42:05] <vifon> Selectrum has a great README as far as "why I should use it" is concerned.  Vertico lacked it for me.
[03:43:00] <vifon> > Selectrum has a similar UI as Vertico. Selectrum is more complex and not fully compatible with every Emacs completion command (Issue #481), since it uses its own filtering infrastructure, which deviates from the standard Emacs completion facilities.
[03:43:02] <vifon> Hm…
[03:43:12] <vifon> That about kills it for me, as I consider orderless great.
[03:43:23] <vifon> Especially with these few custom rules present in my config.
[03:43:34] *** Joins: jtgd (~jay@user/jtgd)
[03:43:52] <tamwile> ok, i'll check your orderless config
[03:44:13] <vifon> tamwile: Let me give you a quick tour then.
[03:44:49] <vifon> If I prepend a pattern with an "!", it excludes the matches.  Great for ignoring the tests when you're looking for an implementation.

[03:45:27] *** Joins: sinic- (~sinic@user/sinic)
[03:45:30] <vifon> And if you append "=" to a pattern, it makes it literal and not a regexp.  It's for the cases when the initial input is not clear enough and you don't really want it to be a regexp.
[03:45:49] <vifon> One is prefix and one is postfix because of the time when you realize you need them.
[03:45:51] *** sinic- is now known as sinic
[03:46:00] <vifon> You know you want to exclude a pattern from the very start.
[03:46:13] <vifon> But the no-regexp one is usually an afterthought.
[03:46:38] <vifon> Not too fancy, it's just elegantly useful.

[03:53:39] <minall> corwin: Thank you, sorry for the late response, I'm gonna ask in #org-mode
[03:53:39] <tamwile> i actually am not using orderless yet, so your config might be useful to me. And the prefix/postfix seems fonctional and logic
[03:55:25] <vifon> tamwile: Are you using prescient?
[03:55:30] <tamwile> yes
[03:55:42] <vifon> Prescient is more or less functionally identical but less customizable.
[03:55:55] <vifon> At least that's how I remember it.

[07:55:49] <piyo> technomancy: q: have you been inconvenienced by having this setup?
[07:57:06] <technomancy> piyo: the only inconvenience is that I have to open URLs from chat in my terminal, not directly from Emacs. so A) I have to use urxvt (other terminals require the mouse to open URLs for some awful reason) and B) for long URLs I have to C-x 1 or they get wrapped.
[07:57:42] <gopiandcode> but how would I interact with the emacs process - through ansi-term/vterm? in that case the experience would probably end up being pretty close to just using any other CLI-based irc client no?
[07:58:21] <technomancy> gopiandcode: I tried vterm and it sucked for this; I run urxvt inside exwm
[07:59:37] <technomancy> you still can use emacs key bindings and window system inside the terminal; just put it in exwm char-mode
[07:59:44] <technomancy> it's not that different from having it local
[07:59:49] <piyo> Can you leverage tmux which IIRC has a way to copy text to the "system" clipboard?
[08:00:05] <technomancy> no, that's another downside, but it has never really bothered me

[12:59:16] <kilobug> bkhl: eshell doesn't spawn an actual shell, it's all elisp code executing on your local emacs; when you combine eshell and tramp, the code stil runs on your local emacs, but with tramp path, so every file manipulation is done remotely (not sure I'm clear enough...)
[13:00:01] <jbe> yes, the eshell runs on your local machine, if you want a remote shell you can use e.g. M-x shell instead

[13:00:17] <bkhl> Yeah, though my understanding is that commands run in eshell on the remote host would be passed through tramp and therefore go through /bin/sh there

[13:34:04] <bpalmer> '(find-file "~/.emacs") is just a form (a list), not a function; lambda , as intothewild and thblt says, is used to create a function that doesn't have a name.

[13:34:50] <bpalmer> intothewild's lambda lacks that, so it won't quite work.
[13:35:15] <thblt> e3d3: you can't avoid defining a function to bind a key sequence, but it doesn't have to have a name, that's the point of lambda.
[13:35:16] <bpalmer> e3d3: giving things a name is really cheap.
[13:35:46] <bpalmer> e3d3: lambda avoids giving it a name, but I actually will always recommend naming a function for a keymap or hook, even if it's simple.
[13:36:06] <e3d3> Using a lamba gives me the error: Wrong type argument: commandp
[13:36:14] <bpalmer> e3d3: you're missing an interactive form.

[13:36:41] <e3d3> I thought I tried that too, Will try again
[13:37:04] <bpalmer> I wish I knew a snazzy Wittgenstein quote about names I could use when people use lambdas.
[13:37:17] <thblt> Re names, you should indeed prefer something like (global-set-key (kbd "C-c h") (defun e3d3/visit-dot-emacs () (interactive) (find-file "~/.emacs")))
[13:38:19] <jbe> "snazzy" and "Wittgenstein quote" doesn't sound like they go together
[13:38:39] <e3d3> The issue was that I had the lamba quoted. I thought I tried that also.
[13:39:05] <bpalmer> a quoted lambda should work, although it may be less efficient
[13:39:06] <thblt> e3d3: also even better would be (find-file user-init-file)
[13:39:07] <jbe> aren't lambdas selfquoting?

[19:18:41] <Guest60> I see
[19:19:04] <Guest60> so how do I get what the symbols are set to in '(a b )
[19:19:20] <dale> Guest60: list is a function, it evaluates its arguments.  quote (which is what ' does) is a special form that means the things inside will not be evaluated.  ('(a b) is equivalent to (quote (a b)).)
[19:19:42] <dale> Guest60: Well, I guess you could (mapcar #'symbol-value '(a b)) but that would be a little unusual.
[19:19:53] <Guest60> that makes perfect sense. Thank you

[23:02:52] <artefact> compiling emacs is hard? just take your distrib's package and tweak its source
[23:03:08] <artefact> like the ebuild/PKGBUILD/etc, not the binary package
[23:03:12] <technomancy> yeah that's what the author did
[23:03:45] <technomancy> they just made the mistake of using homebrew first instead of nix
[23:04:11] <artefact> to be fair some distros make this easier than others
[23:04:18] <artefact> *cough* debian
[23:05:12] <rpav> compiling emacs isn't really hard even from source, unless you're missing a bunch of deps, and then it's mostly hunting those down
[23:05:19] <rpav> source = pristine source
[23:05:31] <ajak> you can patch via the package manager in gentoo, so you get all the benefits of having the package still in the package manager
[23:05:47] <technomancy> that's basically what they did here
[23:05:49] <ajak> you don't even need to edit any ebuilds
[23:05:50] <technomancy> if you read the article =)
[23:06:13] <artefact> finding the right ./configure flags might be a frustrating exercice in futility
[23:06:15] <ajak> yes, i'm just bragging on my distro a little bit :P
[23:06:25] <artefact> if the make defaults are as good as the emacs defaults...
[23:07:15] <artefact> never mind the poor debian that need a sh*tton of -devel packages, because saving a few kilobytes of disk space is worth making life miserable for every hacker
[23:07:26] <ajak> in gentoo it's as easy as throwing a .patch in a directory though, not even worthy of a huge blogpost
