[02:45:23] <abraham> In big query's standard SQL, is it possible to get the most recent value for each column after grouping by id without explicitly listing each column manually? I'm using ARRAY_AGG(col1 IGNORE NULLS ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1)[OFFSET(0)] as col1. This works fine, but I have to do this for each column col1, col2, ... etc. I want to write a query
[02:45:23] <abraham> once that will always work even if table schema changes. Any ideas?

[05:18:46] <Xgc> abraham: array_agg doesn't seem like the right approach.  You just want the most recent row for each id, correct?  That is simple, if you really mean id and id is not the primary key or unique.  Since id is usually the PK/unique, you might be asking the wrong question.
[05:19:25] <Xgc> abraham: Use window functions and either a derived table or CTE term to do that.
[05:19:38] <Xgc> abraham: Very simple.
[05:20:21] <Xgc> funhouse: Same exact answer as abraham's.
[05:20:55] <Xgc> funhouse: There are other ways to do it in PG.
[05:21:11] <abraham> Xgc: I have a table that's append only, each row has an ID field and then a bunch of columns with data for each column (most are null). The query I want is to group by the id and then retrieve the last non-null value for each column
[05:22:02] <abraham> I want the most recent value for each column independently of the row it's on
[05:22:46] <Xgc> abraham: YOu didn't ask about last non-null in the original question.  Most recent usually has nothing to do with null.
[05:23:26] <Xgc> abraham: Why wouldn't the last row contain the last values?
[05:24:24] <Xgc> abraham: That requirement will involve naming each column, which you didn't want to do.
[05:24:59] <Xgc> This sounds like a design mistake if you're worried about schema changes and are treating each column independently.
[05:25:25] <abraham> Each row basically represents an update call in code. That update call will have different fields every time for a specific id, so the last row will only have a small subset of the complete set of columns ever seen for an id
[05:26:40] <abraham> to clarify, this is all happening in a DB warehouse, not an oltp db
[05:27:29] <Xgc> abraham: You can't do that without specifying columns explicitly.  But you could dynamically build your SQL based on information_schema.  But that will be costly.
[05:28:20] <abraham> Xgc: that's what I'm currently doing, I dynamically produce a query after fetching the table's schema. Which part is costly?
[05:28:59] <abraham> But I was trying to figure out if I could just create a view one time and not have to think about that again, but it seems I cannot
[05:29:03] <Xgc> abraham: The information_schema / iteration to build / execute the SQL, instead of a single query.
[05:29:35] <Xgc> abraham: A view can not refer to unknown columns.
[05:30:54] <Xgc> abraham: Some window functions can handle the null behavior, but that would still require separate explicit references to each column.

[05:32:57] <Xgc> That can come at the cost of needing more general types to hold data and loss of some validation.
[05:33:11] <Xgc> Depends on detail not provided.

[05:34:25] <abraham> Xgc: The input data has no predictable structure to it, it can be anything. Initially, I considering storing as a JSON string, and performing all the conversions at the time of querying, but decided instead to flatten the data and store as columns. I handle schema changes on the fly when I detect it. Right now, every column is a String and I cast
[05:34:25] <abraham> it to whatever type I want upon querying.
[05:35:47] <abraham> So far, it's been working decently, just annoying to have to dynamically produce this query every time to get the latest value of each column
[05:38:45] <abraham> in my research, i was a little surprised to learn how non-trivial the solution for this is, even though it sounds kinda trivial at a high level
[05:38:56] <Xgc> abraham: That actually could lend itself to that higher level of normalization where N columns would be expressed as N rows per id.  Now it's all dynamic, without information_schema and the query can be written once.
[05:39:31] <Xgc> abraham: This solution is trivial.
[05:40:00] <Xgc> abraham: You can now add "previous new columns" by just inserting new rows per id.
[05:40:47] <Xgc> abraham: Everything is now dynamic.  Each row would indicate the "logical column".
[05:41:17] <Xgc> Each row could have a type specifier, even though the stored DB type is string (VARCHAR).
[05:41:41] <Xgc> Fairly easily done.
[05:42:04] <Xgc> Now there are no nulls entered.  Each column can be updated separately, as needed.
[05:42:17] <Xgc> The only nulls found are those representing real last values.
[05:42:41] <Xgc> nulls no longer mean "column not updated".
[05:43:29] <Xgc> The rows are narrower and less costly to change.  Only the "logical column" being changed is touched.
[05:44:20] <Xgc> On the other hand, inserting the complete row, with all actual values, requires N rows, one for each logical columns.
[05:44:31] <Xgc> logical column
[05:45:10] <Xgc> That seems like a practical tradeoff, since you really wanted to treat each column independently.
[05:45:21] <abraham> I considered having a dynamic property table, basically similar to what you described. I would just need to figure out how to make it work nicely with the rest of my system. It moves some of the complexity to the querying side, but I think doable
[05:46:07] <Xgc> All the schema changes related to new columns go away.
[05:46:37] <abraham> Yeah that would be very convenient
[05:47:14] <Xgc> Plus all the application advantages that derive from that.
