[02:33:26] <mikebutash> yeah, imho
[02:33:26] <demonicmaniac1> precision is a workstation, xps is crap
[02:33:44] <demonicmaniac1> if you want durabilty and replacement parts and such
[02:33:51] <mikebutash> precision is pretty much the same hardware as an xps, just with a xeon proc.
[02:33:57] <topcat001> I agree precision is very expensive, but Dell gives us a crazy corporate discount
[02:34:00] <demonicmaniac1> not the 5xxx precusions though, just the latitudes
[02:34:09] <demonicmaniac1> and 7xxx
[02:34:14] <topcat001> so effectively not bad for us
[02:34:15] <demonicmaniac1> 3xxx/5xxx are not good

[02:34:57] <demonicmaniac1> you can score an e14 or e15 with a 5500u/5700u without dgpu with corporate discounts for 500 bucks probably though
[02:34:58] <topcat001> sales/marketing gets xps 13/15 and us devs get Precisions
[02:34:59] <mikebutash> well, last time I bought my xps15 was 2017, so I'm sure shit's probably changed, so I'm down with being schooled.
[02:35:21] <demonicmaniac1> that gives you a good vega dgpu and good zen2 cpu beating the pants of anything intel
[02:35:26] <topcat001> we have gotten 60% off on bulk precision orders
[02:35:51] <topcat001> and service has been stellar too
[02:36:09] <demonicmaniac1> you can always get a latitude if you don't need a beefy dgpu too
[02:36:23] <demonicmaniac1> precision are just fatter gpus over the latitudes really

[08:50:51] <alloy> pacman is only mentioned once, not in that context
[08:50:56] <mpan> Yes, it does. Literally ‚ÄúInstall the grub package.‚Äù Even with a link to what ‚Äúinstall‚Äù means.
[08:51:39] <alloy> Installation
[08:51:39] <coruja> ah, down there
[08:51:40] <alloy> Install the grub package. (It will replace grub-legacyAUR if that is already installed.) Then do:

[08:54:11] <mpan> This is not a copy-paste guide. You are supposed to understand what you are doing. Which means: knowing the right commands to do that, where those commands are widely used.
[08:54:22] <alloy> up until now the install wiki has been using pacstrap to install

[08:55:57] <alloy> I know and respect that arch has a famously good wiki, but it's possible to end up going down a never ending wiki rabbit hole when things aren't too clear.... also sooo much stuff in wikis is out of date.
[08:56:17] <coruja> the word 'install' contains a link to how to install packages
[08:56:48] <alloy> "install a bootloader - for example command1 command2 is all you need to configure grub, the most common bootloader"
[08:57:35] <alloy> hey, I've been a Linux sysadmin for over 20 years so if I find it hard to follow :')
[08:58:13] <alloy> like telling someone the best way to learn linux is to read all the man pages - that's just horrible advice ;)
[08:58:13] <mpan> Anyway, solved now.
[08:58:21] *** Joins: synchris (~quassel@user/synchris)
[08:58:49] <mpan> And ‚Äúinstall‚Äù in Arch context usually means `pacman -S packages`. `pacstrap` is also just a wrapper over `pacman -S` that makes things easier.
[09:01:11] <alloy> yeah, 100% not trying to be argumentative or rude, totally appreciate the work of the FOSS community.¬† Just suggesting it might be better to simplify the bootloader section of the install wiki... the rest was easy to follow.
[09:01:14] <Santzes> I can actually see the point as pacman hasn't been used in the guide yet
[09:02:00] <mpan> Santzes: there is a link. Literally the first word of that sentence is a link.
[09:02:06] <mpan> Anyway, it‚Äôs solved now.
[09:02:33] <bookworm> it assumes that you know the difference between say something like debootstrap and apt... Arch isn't exactly targeting people new to Linux
[09:03:08] <mpan> Unless you do not download and run random apps in your browser (aka JavaScript), that is something that is there to provide explanation for exactly that situation.

[09:07:10] <mpan> The GRUB article is not really a part of the installation itself. It‚Äôs a documentation for GRUB. And, again, there is a link already that provides explanations.

[09:08:18] *** Quits: jjt (~jjt@user/jjt) (Quit: Lost terminal)
[09:08:28] <mpan> What could be done, perhaps, is making a separate article about installing a boot loader for people, who use the installation guide. But that would basically duplicate the same article with just a different wording.
[09:09:32] <alloy> oh my point is that pretty much everyone uses grub, so a couple of lines at the end of install would work, then have the links for someone that might want to go a different way
[09:10:06] <mpan> My point is that you were pointed to it during the installation procedure, but that doesn‚Äôt have to be the case in general.
[09:10:32] <coruja> maybe it would be a good idea to place the 'install grub package' hint at the top of the grub wiki page as it's necessary for both kinds of systems

[09:35:19] <mpan> alloy: anyway, have you solved the partition issue? I asked about whether `lsblk` lists ‚Äú/boot‚Äù as being a mountpoint for anything.
[09:35:53] <alloy> mpan nope, only swap and /mnt are mounted
[09:36:44] <mpan> I can‚Äôt help with EFI much, as I am myself on BIOS systems, but I can at least verify some things and spot some common mistakes.

[09:37:32] <mpan> alloy: if it‚Äôs not mounted (but be sure it really is not!), then perhaps you have run something that operates on ‚Äú/boot‚Äù before mounting it. That happens from time to time.

[09:42:04] <mpan> Installing the linux package causes `mkinitcpio` to be invoked, which will blindly write to ‚Äú/boot‚Äù. Probably from that.

[11:45:22] <spiral> kib: you may want to decrease the quality before putting them in the pdf, that might help
[11:45:30] <Foxboron> kib: right, I missed that question
[11:45:53] <alloy> a quick web search came up with a heap of online pdf "shrinkers" even one from adobe.com
[11:45:54] <kib> also Foxboron let's some some support question is already answered but there's a better way of solving it. If someone else who knows the better logs in and all they see is junk in the chat, the question does get ignored

[15:18:53] <Gagis> on a related note. I am using EFISTUB and a bit miffed with it. How large is the danger of breaking my system if I try to migrate it to booting grub instead of kernel image directly?
[15:19:05] <grawity> Gagis: very small tbh
[15:19:08] <rcf> Almost zero. 
[15:19:14] <MacGyver> Gagis: "Breaking" in what sense.
[15:19:32] <grawity> install grub first, it should work as usual, and if it works then just remove the efistub-based boot entry
[15:19:35] <MacGyver> Gagis: You won't (usually) brick the system, at most you'll just have to boot into the install ISO and fix the boot loader manually.
[15:19:39] <Gagis> in the sense of needing to spend a couple of hours repairing an unbootable system
[15:19:53] <grawity> nah worst case is needing to spend 15 minutes
[15:19:56] <gabbiel> grawity: the menu, but its not really a "menu", because grub is used, its the way it makes it look, the font is so disgusting, just for that reason alone I dont want to use efi bootin
[15:20:07] <grawity> gabbiel: yeah, pretty sure you can skip the EFI boot menu
[15:20:23] <Gagis> that option should be in your uefi bios settings
[15:20:23] <grawity> gabbiel: I mean millions of systems boot Windows and Linux (indeed even GRUB) via EFI, but without displaying any EFI menus
[15:20:41] <grawity> gabbiel: in fact I'm not entirely sure why it shows up on your system
[15:20:58] <Gagis> yeah, normally it needs to be manually enabled to be shown at all
[15:21:17] <grawity> gabbiel: normally it only shows up if a) you hit the "boot menu" key, or b) all its usual boot options failed or something

[15:22:41] <grawity> is the issue that the text is all kind of stretched?
[15:22:51] <rcf> gabbiel: if you think grub just looks ugly at the default EFI resolution, you can configure that. 
[15:22:55] <gabbiel> the issue is the way efi booting makes the grub menu and initial loading fonts look 
[15:23:04] <grawity> and how old is your motherboard
[15:23:21] <grawity> older (as in ~10 year old) EFI systems indeed had poor support for higher resolutions
[15:23:21] <jkc> gabbiel: And does that issue solve itself by the time the system is actually booted and ready for use?
[15:23:25] <gabbiel> yes the text is stretched

[15:23:55] <gabbiel> yeah by the time the os is up all is good
[15:23:59] <grawity> e.g. my 16:9 laptop used to boot at 1024x768 ... though it did that in all modes, not EFI-specific, it's just that EFI font was more terminus-like than the usual IBM font
[15:24:03] *** Joins: xoan3 (~xoan@user/xoan)
[15:24:12] <grawity> on *newer* EFI systems, grub can actually be told to use a higher resolution
[15:24:35] <grawity> GRUB_GFXMODE=1366x768x32 or something
[15:24:38] <jkc> If the ugly font problem resolves itself by the time the system is in a state to actually be used, then who cares?
[15:24:53] <grawity> nah, ugly is ugly
[15:24:53] <Gagis> MacGyver, I wrote a script to make updating entries easier but I'm still a bit worried about what happens if I end up with a broken kernel or faulty boot options and need to boot via USB to fix it. Would be nice to use grubs boot option editor on the fly
[15:25:04] <grawity> but I'd much rather fix the ugly in a better way than switching all the way to BIOS/CSM mode
[15:25:05] <gabbiel> I care, I want it to look good
[15:25:12] <Gagis> and have more space for fallback kernel. putting two images into the efi partition is getting crowded
[15:25:27] <jkc> grawity: Nah, this is whiny nitpicking.
[15:25:30] <MacGyver> Gagis: You may want to consider systemd-boot instead.
[15:25:40] <MacGyver> Gagis: Features you want without the complexity of grub.
[15:25:41] <Gagis> good point, I certainly might
[15:25:47] <gabbiel> also, how do I even propagate grub settings, my system doesn't even have the update-grub executable for some reason

[15:30:05] <MacGyver> Though you may need to alter the output path -- I don't know what filesystem layout the install scripts use for EFI.
[15:30:35] <MacGyver> So check first whether grub.cfg is already at the location that's telling you to write to.
[15:30:37] <MacGyver> Then overwrite.
[15:31:56] <Gagis> hm, I think my /boot mount is the actual efi partition. might have to remove that mount point and create an actual /boot directory when migrating? well, can't be too hard

[15:33:26] <MacGyver> Gagis: No, you don't need to.
[15:33:34] <MacGyver> Gagis: Utilizing the ESP as /boot is perfectly fine.

[15:33:45] *** diep_ is now known as diep
[15:33:53] <Gagis> well, as long as I dont add more kernel imagine than it has space
[15:33:55] <Gagis> yeah
[15:34:09] <MacGyver> If you're seriously considering splitting it, skip systemd-boot.
[15:34:32] <MacGyver> At the moment handling separate /boot is a bit... iffy.
[15:34:50] <MacGyver> The loader entries need to be on the same partition as the kernel images, iirc.
[15:35:09] <MacGyver> And it needs to be able to read it using UEFI FS drivers so it'd still have to be FAT32 usually.
[15:35:22] <MacGyver> Unless that's been worked around / fixed by now.
[15:35:36] <Gagis> well thats fine then. will just have to think what to do about fallback images. started getting low space on partition warnings after a recent kernel update with how large the -fallback.img got

[15:39:06] <grawity> though
[15:39:18] <grawity> that depends on what filesystem you use for /, you might still need a separate /boot in some cases

[15:40:31] <MacGyver> That's the one thing it still has going for it, support for the kernel and initramfs in any place it can access with its own modules.

[16:42:00] <MacGyver> Those may be CCX's with one malfunctioning core.
[16:42:26] <varighet> for me it needs to be 2c, 4c, 8c, 16c or 32c
[16:42:32] <varighet> 6, 12, etc just feels wrong
[16:42:39] <Gagis> yeah, IIRC their cheaper processors tend to be chips that fail QA for the expensive one but pass with some disabled cores
[16:42:46] <jelle> 20 cores!
[16:42:50] <varighet> lol
[16:42:59] <MacGyver> 14 was the sweet spot of price/functionality for me.
[16:43:03] <jelle> who cares as long as it is > 4
[16:43:10] <MacGyver> Allows me to give 10 cores to the VM and keep 4 for the host.
[16:43:19] <jelle> :o
[16:43:25] <jelle> MacGyver: vm running windows?
[16:43:27] <MacGyver> (Yes. It's overkill. Sue me.)
[16:43:29] <MacGyver> jelle: Yeah.
[16:44:06] <MacGyver> I'd been running on a 6c/12t and giving 5 cores to the VM, and it was clearly struggling in games, so I decided to upgrade to something that'd last me at least 6 years.
[16:44:09] <MacGyver> Hopefully more like 10.

[16:44:52] <MacGyver> Why?
[16:45:09] <MacGyver> If anything, CPU advancement has slowed down a *lot* in the past decade.
[16:45:17] <SysGhost> GPU race gonna require a whole lot more from the CPU side.
[16:45:48] <MacGyver> I doubt I'll have a problem with that.

[16:45:58] <SysGhost> Maybe... but.. I'm not so sure it'll slow down. Now that Intel and AMD is on par with each other it'll go nuts.

[20:25:19] <Nistar> Very nice. That'll probably be good enuogh for me.
[20:25:43] <farchord> Nistar I would check the Lutris and ProtonDB site pages for the games you frequently play
[20:25:52] <farchord> Those are usually the best places to start
[20:25:52] <brejela> Nistar: You can always check protondb to see if a specific game you're looking to play is compatible.
[20:25:59] <farchord> XD
[20:26:03] <HEX0> also if you did buy a game license you can technically obtain without drm :P

[20:30:07] <SmarmyWalrus> So I have a weird gaming question. I've been getting into vitetris (multiplatform, but been playing in the arch vm recently) and it accepts both keyboard and traditional /dev/input/js0 input. However, I noticed when I move my mouse it breaks the game; tiles moving around, etc. So I investigated whether or not my /dev/input/js0 was actually active. Sure enough, my mouse input does correspond to changes on /dev/input/js0. Does anyone 
[20:30:07] <SmarmyWalrus> know a way to disable this behavior? Terminals tested include Kitty, Alacritty, and Foot. Running sway-wm. Am in a VirtualBox VM in case that could matter here.

[22:11:47] <MacGyver> Right, this works like I want now, including screenlocking.
[22:12:13] <MacGyver> (Probably because of delay.sh in /usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep, but eh)

[22:13:50] <MacGyver> See the reason I even was still using acpid for this was because the firmware on this laptop was so broken, that *closing* the lid would *resume* from suspend.
[22:14:06] <MacGyver> So I had an acpid-script that would wait for 5s after lid-close before suspending.
[22:14:08] <susi> MacGyver: could you add an inhibitor with "delay" mode?
[22:14:25] <MacGyver> Possibly.
