[02:49:36] <sshine> when you run https://www.sshaudit.com/ on a vanilla debian (I'm sure it does not vary much for other distros), I'm getting a pretty low score. I'd like to know what you people think of the arguments for these, if there are any you disagree with.
[02:51:39] *** Quits: tex (~super@user/dix) (Quit: tex)
[02:51:52] <Alipha> oofta. i got a 40/100 on mine
[02:54:17] *** Joins: igemnace (~ian@user/igemnace)
[02:55:26] <Alipha> sshine: do you have a "vanilla debian" report to share?
[02:58:04] <Alipha> so, looking at the sample report, i'm not sure how i feel about giving all NIST curves a score reduction of 2. i mean, you're getting into conspiracy theory area there.
[02:58:04] <int-e> hmm, 49/100 here for what should be vanilla Debian... it wants 3072 bit moduli for RSA, hates on NIST curves, and says that sha1 is exploitable for MACs.
[02:58:48] <Alipha> and sha1 is not exploitable in these contexts. so that's just false.
[02:58:48] <int-e> Also SHA-1 says "score capped at 70", and all the reductions are applied afterwards, so it ends up at 70-21 = 49.
[02:59:18] <int-e> Yeah. But it says "SHA-1 has exploitable weaknesses." and that's technically true :-P
[02:59:49] <int-e> "Uses encrypt-and-MAC method. Score reduced by 1." What's that about?
[02:59:58] <int-e> (hmac-sha2-256 among others)
[03:00:15] <int-e> "Contact Positron Security for assistance in fixing this configuration by clicking here."
[03:00:17] <Alipha> int-e: https://moxie.org/2011/12/13/the-cryptographic-doom-principle.html
[03:00:53] <int-e> I smell quite a bit of fear mongering. :-/
[03:01:09] <Alipha> but using sha1 really shouldn't impact the score. at least, not severely. i suppose the fact that there's vulnerabilities could mean that there's more severe non-disclosed vulnerabilities, but yeah.. i'd call it fear mongering
[03:01:36] <Alipha> int-e: encrypt-and-mac is indeed an issue. so is using 3des (which i see on the vulnerability report)
[03:01:36] <int-e> I mean... sure, it's all stuff you can just switch off without doing harm so why not.
[03:02:21] <Alipha> and i find it incredibly surprising that it DOES NOT MENTION turning off password authentication
[03:02:22] <int-e> 3des was not on my list :P
[03:02:39] <Alipha> 3des is on the sample report
[03:03:11] <int-e> "my list" - I scanned an actual Debian server of mine.
[03:03:20] <sshine> Alipha, the nistp curve criticism, at least, I understand what they mean.
[03:04:30] <Alipha> (i scanned my own machine and i have password authentication turned on)
[03:04:35] <sshine> ;)
[03:04:43] <Alipha> (the audit didn't say anything about it)
[03:04:54] <sshine> oh.
[03:04:55] <sshine> good to know.
[03:06:03] <sshine> I also think there may be a point in changing the port number from 22 to avoid some amount of targeted scans. but then on the other hand, if most other things work well, that's less of a risk and more of an "avoiding log spam"... I guess some of these compound, e.g. if you have port 22 and you have weak password authentication, that's actually dangerous, but if any of those are not true, it's significantly 
[03:06:09] <sshine> less.
[03:06:22] <Alipha> oh yeah, it didn't mention that either
[03:07:44] <sshine> "umac-64-etm@openssh.com
[03:07:46] <sshine>     MAC uses small tag size. Score reduced by 2."
[03:07:47] <Alipha> so, my complaints are: no mention of changing the port or turning off password auth. it doesn't make encrypt-and-MAC severe enough. and it makes the NIST curves and SHA1 too severe
[03:08:16] <sshine> Alipha, ok, making a note about encrypt-and-MAC. and thanks for the Moxie link.
[03:09:05] <hg> well, 50/100 for me
[03:09:07] <hg> so, that's something
[03:09:15] <hg> this looks like an excellent resource
[03:09:18] <int-e> Alipha: this is their scan in my logs; they never try to actuall authenticate, so they wouldn't see password authentication? http://paste.debian.net/1232172/
[03:09:45] <int-e> so they can't complain about it either
[03:09:53] <hg> lol, it's quite harsh on NIST curve
[03:09:55] <hg> s/$/s/
[03:10:53] <Alipha> int-e: i'm not really familiar with the ssh protocol. i'm surprised authentication methods aren't shared at the same time that the available encryption algorithms are shared
[03:11:08] <int-e> they depend on the user, don't they?
[03:11:11] <sshine> HostKeyAlgorithms ssh-ed25519,rsa-sha2-256,rsa-sha2-512
[03:11:11] <sshine> KexAlgorithms curve25519-sha256,curve25519-sha256@libssh.org
[03:11:11] <sshine> MACs umac-128-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com
[03:11:45] <sshine> I basically took all the things they didn't complain about. :)
[03:11:52] <sshine> but this seems like golfing.
[03:12:00] <sshine> most of the things they talk about, I have no clue what actually means.
[03:12:47] <sshine> haha, when you use it too often, they start redirecting you to a Rick Astley YouTube video :)
[03:13:50] <sshine> wait, that's just if you give it a wrong port number.
[03:14:00] <Alipha> sshine: what don't you understand?

[03:15:53] <int-e> Alipha: Anyway, I don't know the protocol either. All I know that ssh -v lists available authentication methods pretty late.
[03:17:02] <sshine> Alipha, one thing was the encrypt-and-MAC; I'm reading up on that :) the other thing I'm not sure about is: it seems that running `ssh -Q mac` gives me a bunch of ciphers they don't mention, some with @openssh.com, some with libssh.org.
[03:18:02] <sshine> Alipha, I'm not sure if e.g. mentioning 'hmac-sha2-512' and 'hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com' in KexAlgorithms is either redundant or does something for compatibility with various ssh clients.

[17:37:12] <MacGyver> A company is more than just its CEO.
[17:37:20] <yawkat> TubbyTommy: signal builds are reproducible
[17:37:42] <MacGyver> The only real risk I see is with the server infrastructure that exposes the social graph.
[17:38:00] <MacGyver> Note: that's not *new*.
[17:39:13] <TubbyTommy> I think the reputation is strong, as it can be, because open-source and ability to compile is a big deal towards that reputation. Even if not everybody does so.
[17:39:21] <MacGyver> I just think that if this new management wants to actually abuse that information, you'd know about it pretty damn fast because *somebody* is going to blow the whistle on that.
[17:40:30] <TubbyTommy> The builds could be compiled and hashed by a tech guru and then the masses can verify the hash to know that they are using the same build.

[18:06:30] <sshine> TubbyTommy, I vaguely recall that WhatsApp was a pretty awesome project before they got acquired and got corrupted.
[18:06:59] <TubbyTommy> I think I may have used it at one time. When I learned that Facebook acquired that was the end of the road for me.
[18:07:11] <TubbyTommy> I won't touch it now.
[18:07:14] <sshine> TubbyTommy, I definitely register it as a warning signal that someone who is associated with the megacorp acquisition of something that resembled Signal in the past. similar to how I'm pretty alert about other bizarre choices made by the Signal team. :)
[18:07:43] <sshine> TubbyTommy, what I recall about WhatsApp pre-acquisition was that they got immensely popular because of good UX.
[18:08:39] <sshine> TubbyTommy, typically, a part of buying a company is asking for the founders to stay for a while.
[18:08:45] <TubbyTommy> Well I don't want assume that everybody working at a megacorp are all like-minded robots following the master. Especially, those who don't have to be from a financial perspective. I think as long as Signal remains open-source we're in an okay area of trust.
[18:08:52] <sshine> TubbyTommy, so the fact that he was also there after the acquisition is just another way of saying he consented to the acquisition.

[18:09:18] <TubbyTommy> Yes, him staying on board for awhile is a reasonable request, not to be filed under conspiracy theories.
[18:09:21] <sshine> TubbyTommy, not that he aligns with the parent company values. mostly people "sell out" so they can buy a house for their family :)
[18:10:03] <sshine> TubbyTommy, I mostly like Signal because they didn't sell out. not because they make perfect strategic choices, hehe.
[18:10:26] <TubbyTommy> I'm using it now, I will keep it until I found strong reasons not to.
[18:10:32] <TubbyTommy> find
[18:10:37] <sshine> I'm also using it. I can actually make my friends use it.
[18:11:10] <sshine> I also don't like that it's tied to a phone number. I do have friends that have to create throwaway phone numbers just to be on it.
[18:11:17] <TubbyTommy> Funny you talk about friends, everybody who is close to me thinks I'm trying to get them to install so I have a secret gateway into their private phone data. LoL!!!

[18:11:31] <sshine> uhm, ok ;)
[18:11:53] <TubbyTommy> People are paranoid about using Signal for some reason. "No thanks, I want the government to see everything I'm doing so they don't think I'm a criminal". LoL!!!!
[18:12:07] <TubbyTommy> Umm, how about "It's just none of their business???"
[18:12:24] <MacGyver> sshine: WhatsApp did *not* resemble Signal, at all, before the facebook acquisition. Whatsapp integrating the signal end-to-end encryption happened *after*.
[18:12:52] <MacGyver> And it had a usable interface.
[18:13:05] <MacGyver> Another way in which it didn't resemble Signal (or TextSecure, at the time.)
[18:14:09] <MacGyver> I remember complaining about this at the time, that if only Signal was a bit more usable the Facebook acquisition would've been a good trigger to get people to move.
[18:14:17] <ms7821> TubbyTommy: do these friends also run telegram by any chance?
[18:14:17] <TubbyTommy> Governments are more corrupt and criminal than the masses, or at least, they are equivalent.
[18:14:50] <sshine> MacGyver, I did not make a claim about WhatsApp having e2ee; I said they got popular because of good UX.
[18:15:05] <TubbyTommy> I doubt it, most of my family are those types that "just wanna surf the web". They don't get into the details of anything like I do.
[18:15:35] <MacGyver> sshine: You said whatsapp resembled signal in the past. I'm saying it didn't.
[18:15:54] <TubbyTommy> end-to-end encryption is a biggie, I'm surprised at that move.
[18:15:59] <sshine> MacGyver, then we're probably comparing on different metrics. :)
[18:16:01] <TubbyTommy> If it's legit, it's good.

[18:17:50] <TubbyTommy> Ah, reminds of a Monty Python skit. :)
[18:17:59] <ms7821> signal/textsecure resembled whatsapp inasmuch as they were mobile messaging apps
[18:18:04] <ms7821> like I don't think that's controversial
[18:18:10] <MacGyver> sshine: I just don't see it as true nor relevant that whatsapp somehow resembled signal when it was acquired. What *is* relevant is that Acton left facebook (apparently over monetization disputes of whatsapp) and he has since spoken out against facebook.
[18:18:30] <MacGyver> sshine: Are you saying you're worried Acton might buddy up to Facebook or another megacorp to be acquired again?

[18:23:00] <MacGyver> sshine: Given Acton's track record I don't think he'll make that mistake again, tbh.
[18:23:14] <MacGyver> sshine: Also I don't think there's many megacorps interested in *acquiring* a messenger nowadays.
[18:23:25] <MacGyver> Most have already done so or built their own.
[18:23:37] <MacGyver> And it's not as though Signal has any kind of critical mass.

[18:23:56] <MacGyver> As opposed to Whatsapp, which was pretty much the de facto messenger in large parts of Europe when Facebook hooked it.
[18:25:26] <MacGyver> God it's really been 8 years since then, hasn't it.

[18:31:29] <sshine> MacGyver, didn't know that Acton had done that; I agree, that counts for something.
[18:32:22] <sshine> MacGyver, hopefully Signal has enough of a reputation as being for its users that it's not attractive as an acquisition target.
[18:34:11] <sshine> I suppose Signal doesn't have critical mass compared to, but relative to their own size, they did get a pretty big boost in the last one or two years. May 2020: 11M users, Jan 2021: 41M users, May 2021: 105M users.

[18:52:20] <ms7821> the biggest influx of users I've seen was whatsapp's recent privacy policy change
[18:52:41] <ms7821> loads of people moved entire groups over to signal
[18:52:49] <ms7821> (it didn't last, but it was good to see)
[18:52:50] <MacGyver> Riiiight, I was wondering what the thing was in the past two years that finally triggered that.
[18:53:05] <MacGyver> But that was the whole "Everyone except those within the jurisdiction of the GDPR are getting fucked" thing.
[18:53:23] <MacGyver> I'd almost totally forgot about that.
