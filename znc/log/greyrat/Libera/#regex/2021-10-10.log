[13:33:39] <maroon> i have a question about "/" being a delimiter or not? mirc supposedly uses pcre, but it allows me to validate mime like ^[a-zA-Z0-9/+]{2,}=*$ but regex101 doesnt like that because of the \ being an unescaped delimiter - if i click over to flavor=javascript then it's allowed - however if i escape the / in mirc, then it also allows the mime string to hold \ too
[13:38:21] <NiLon> maroon well if you don't have delimiters set in the pattern, then it's not confusing to engine because they can be set explicitly
[13:38:40] <NiLon> regex101 you have the problem of setting // by default, thus / in the pattern causes a conflict
[13:39:14] <maroon> so mirc compiled with an option 'no the / is not a delimiter'?
[13:39:23] <NiLon> not sure how to explain it, it's syntax sugar
[13:39:37] <NiLon> it's not actually part of the pattern in a matter of speaking
[13:40:26] <NiLon> delimiters generally could be anything as long something tells where the prefix, pattern and syntax end and start
[13:40:38] <NiLon> s/syntax/suffix
[13:41:37] <maroon> so is there a way that the pattern works in both mirc and regex101? without also allowing mirc to see \ in the string as valid
[13:41:41] <NiLon> so mirc basically does something like such as regex = new Engine(user_pattern, modifiers)
[13:42:02] <NiLon> you can set regex101 delimiter to something else than /
[13:43:04] <maroon> i could've sworn i fed this mime pattern to regex101 before without it barfing on the /
[13:43:06] <NiLon> just click the |/ thingy at left
[13:43:54] <NiLon> if you feed it with custom modifiers, such as @^[a-zA-Z0-9/+]{2,}=*$@ then it automatically swaps it
[13:45:32] <NiLon> but I don't think mirc sees \/ as two characters
[13:45:45] <NiLon> that would be silly, tho it is mirc so I guess anything is possible in the retardo language
[13:47:17] <maroon> ok that part i was mistaken, i have to include \\ inside the [list] to get it to see literal \ in the string
[13:48:29] <NiLon> anyway if you just put \/ in the pattern, it should be universal to any language no matter the modifiers
[13:48:39] <maroon> i had a c# code that was behaving the same way as mirc, but it did have the @"pattern" so it wasnt barfing on things like \d
[13:48:54] <NiLon> I always suggest to escape / needed or not, just because it can cause weird stuff when you don't expect it
[13:49:43] <maroon> even when using \d ?
[13:49:51] <maroon> sorry i misread
[13:53:48] <maroon> im thinking mirc is probably getting the c# behavior from having the string begin/end with @'s

[18:59:44] <maroon> yeah it matches the 1 in 1234567890
[19:00:10] <NiLon> as it should
[19:01:02] <re101-impala-46> NiLon (\d)(?!\1|$) this avoids repetation but not fails at 1234567790 first 7 not matched
[19:01:20] <re101-impala-46> but fails*
[19:01:31] <NiLon> well you should not all should be same
[19:01:34] <NiLon> they are not
[19:01:48] <NiLon> maybe define the full rule first
[19:02:02] <re101-impala-46> ok
[19:02:55] <re101-impala-46> 1) should be 10 digits. 2) all the 10 digits should not be the same
[19:03:21] <NiLon> ok well your rule 2 is faulty
[19:03:31] <re101-impala-46> 9 or 11 digits are invalid 
[19:03:48] <re101-impala-46> how ?
[19:04:12] <NiLon> 1111111111 <- has all the same digits, 1111111112 <- doesn't have all the same digits
[19:04:43] <NiLon> if you have a false match with 1234567790, then clearly rule 2 is defined wrong
[19:05:23] <maroon> should this match: 1234512345
[19:05:39] <re101-impala-46> yes maroon
[19:06:00] <NiLon> it seems like no repeating digit
[19:06:33] <maroon> so you want to match all 100 million 10-digit numbers except for the 10 numbers like 1111111111 ?
[19:07:26] <re101-impala-46> (\d)(?!\1|$) but this avoid first 7 though? also matches 1234 which is not 10 digits
[19:09:01] <re101-impala-46> (\d)\1{9} this is good...but we have to find negation of this plus should restrict to 10 digits 
[19:09:12] <NiLon> your rule 2 is still faultyy
[19:09:56] <NiLon> focus on it, it's the most important rule you have
[19:10:15] <re101-impala-46> 1111111112 is valid input... 2nd rule says ALL should not be same
[19:11:01] <NiLon> well wtf you just said 1234567790 is no good
[19:11:16] <digitok> ^(?!(\d)\1+$)\d{10}$
[19:11:54] <re101-impala-46> NiLon your pattern matches one by one also your pattern gives 1234 is valid which is not 10 diguts

[19:15:14] <NiLon> that passes the 1234567790

[19:15:58] <maroon> because that's not ten consecutive repeat of same digit, 1111111112 should match
[19:16:00] <NiLon> YOU said 1234567790 should fail
[19:16:11] <NiLon> I said your rule is faulty if that is the case
[19:16:41] <NiLon> either you were mistaken or you are wrong, pick your poison here
[19:16:55] <re101-impala-46> i said your regex is not matching after it encounters first 7
