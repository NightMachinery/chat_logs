[00:05:23] <Ungwelian> Etymologically it's pretty much the same as mind.

[02:43:13] <tomathy> is compassion still good in a world of trickery?
[02:43:38] <tomathy> if everyone is smart and deceptive, what should the compassionate do?
[02:43:59] <tomathy> every time they go out they give to a rich fake beggar
[02:44:16] <tomathy> when they see a wounded person, it's a victim of gang crime, and they have to pay the gang
[02:44:35] <tomathy> so whenever they seek to do good it gets turned into evil
[02:45:07] <tomathy> when they call an ambulance, they come and kill the guy and take his organs
[02:45:24] <tomathy> seems wisdom is key to compassion
[02:45:31] <tomathy> you can't really have sustainable compassion without wisdom
[02:45:57] <tomathy> agree?
[02:53:34] <bittersweetsymph> I think Mother Theresa hit the nail on the head when she said, "      If you are honest and sincere people may deceive you.  Be honest and sincere anyway"
[02:55:12] <bittersweetsymph> https://prayerfoundation.org/mother_teresa_do_it_anyway.htm
[02:55:12] <ro-bot-o> [url] Mother Teresa: " Do It Anyway" (The Prayer Foundation). | prayerfoundation.org
[02:55:27] <biys> tomathy: that's interesting
[02:55:42] <bittersweetsymph> I am not saying this advocating any religion but she made a good point.
[02:55:51] <biys> how is it a good point?
[02:56:07] <biys> other than just because you're saying it is
[02:56:56] <bittersweetsymph> Because you cannot help if others are deceptive, and sure some will be to you but we cannot let that stop us seeking to be good people.
[02:56:58] <tomathy> bittersweetsymph: i agree with that statement, but if you knowingly allow yourself to be exploited, you become a contributor to it
[02:57:00] <causative> it could be interpreted as advocating for virtue ethics
[02:57:25] <biys> bittersweetsymph: why are we seeking to be good people?
[02:57:44] <bittersweetsymph> biys: i like to think most would be
[02:57:48] <causative> why *are* we, or why *should* we?
[02:58:00] <causative> because they are different questions
[02:58:15] <biys> why do you think most would?
[02:58:39] <biys> and what do you think about those who don't?
[02:58:44] <bittersweetsymph> I don't know if they would or would not but i hope
[02:58:55] <biys> why do you hope?
[02:59:04] <biys> this is just one turn of illogical thinking after another
[02:59:12] <bittersweetsymph> Ok
[02:59:49] <biys> so it sounds like you're placing on the world some expectation of how people ought to live based simply on how you feel inside?
[02:59:52] <biys> is that accurate would you say?
[03:00:05] <causative> we *should* seek to be good people, because what we should do is defined as those behaviors that if followed by everyone make the most desirable society overall.  And being good people helps to make the most desirable society overall.
[03:00:10] <bittersweetsymph> I have to go do something. Have a great day
[03:00:58] <biys> and you're saying a goal is to make the most desirable society?
[03:00:59] <biys> for who?
[03:01:10] <causative> for idealists perhaps
[03:01:17] <biys> that makes sense
[03:01:53] <causative> it's a real motivation for some people, including myself - we want things to be done "right," and what's "right" is the rules that if followed help everybody so that the society as a whole is improved
[03:02:14] <biys> help everybody
[03:02:26] <causative> not everyone's motivations are entirely a question of what gets safety and sensual stimulation for them personally
[03:02:58] <causative> but that's about why we *should* seek to be good people - the other question is why *do* we seek to be good people
[03:03:07] <biys> good people
[03:03:12] <biys> there's so much rhetoric here
[03:03:24] <causative> and the latter is partly about the first, and partly about doing what we were told to do as children, and partly about wanting to have a positive self-image for ourselves which would be damaged if we hurt others
[03:03:32] <biys> it's a matter of preconceived notions it sounds like
[03:04:19] <biys> first off you're stating that something is more admirable than another.  in this case, the way we treat each other.  you're suggesting that it's necessary for some particular reason or another
[03:04:28] <biys> can you elaborate on that at all?
[03:04:55] <causative> what you said is vague so that I don't know which part of what I said you're referring to
[03:05:11] <causative> "something" and "something" is necessary for "some particular reason" - I really do not know what you are referring to
[03:05:17] <biys> me either
[03:05:24] <biys> i'm lost by what it is you're attempting to say
[03:05:29] <biys> it sounds romantic though!
[03:06:10] <causative> you wish to say that what I said is as vague as that - but I do not see it that way, and from what you said it is not possible to identify what part of what I said you are even talking about
[03:06:34] <biys> i'm saying you have preconceived notions about something or another assocaited with how people ought to live
[03:06:47] <biys> i'm asking about the forumation of those ideas in your mind
[03:06:51] <biys> formulation
[03:07:03] <causative> yes, specifically, people ought to live in a way that makes a better society as a whole
[03:07:07] <biys> why?
[03:07:12] <biys> says who?
[03:07:31] <causative> call it instinct - I become upset when I see people living in ways harmful to society
[03:07:38] <causative> and probably so do you
[03:07:39] <biys> instinct
[03:08:06] <biys> what would be an example of a way of living that is harmful to society would you say?
[03:08:19] <causative> lying, cheating, stealing
[03:08:35] <causative> breaking the rules in a way that benefits them personally and hurts everyone else
[03:08:47] <causative> improper colluding
[03:09:07] <biys> that sounds more like jealousy to me
[03:09:26] <causative> that's not the way I feel - I do not feel jealous, I don't want to be like people who do that
[03:09:38] <causative> it is anger, not jealousy
[03:09:42] <biys> you feel as though they've gotten something unfairly
[03:09:54] <causative> yes but that's not necessarily jealousy
[03:10:06] <causative> it would only be jealousy if I wanted to do the same thing
[03:10:10] <biys> you feel as though they should suffer the slings and arrows as you do/did
[03:10:33] <causative> that's not accurate
[03:11:02] *** Joins: random-jellyfish (~random-je@user/random-jellyfish)
[03:11:04] <causative> first, after they have committed such crimes, I feel that they should suffer for their crimes, much more than I or other rule-abiders have suffered
[03:11:08] <causative> I want to punish them
[03:11:13] <thunder> tomathy: need is custodian of desire. if you live by your needs, your surplus is what to share with others to help them satisfy their needs. if they're hungry, make them food. if they're thirsty, give them water. if they want money, show them to the welfare office.
[03:11:26] <biys> crime
[03:11:31] <causative> second, if we're talking about before they commit their crimes, what I want is not for them to suffer, but for them to follow the rules so that everybody benefits and suffers less
[03:11:52] <causative> I am speaking of crimes in the metaphorical, moral sense here
[03:11:58] <causative> synonym for "offenses"
[03:12:06] <tomathy> thunder: thanks
[03:12:15] <tomathy> so compassion is simpler than i made out?
[03:12:18] <biys> you want to punish them
[03:12:25] <causative> if they hurt society, yes
[03:12:38] <tomathy> perhaps compassion can be so simple that wisdom is not needed. is compassion undeceivable?
[03:12:43] <causative> because society is better off if offenders are punished - it incentivizes them not to offend
[03:12:50] <thunder> tomathy: it's okay to be kind. but if people are more interested in satisfying their desires than their needs, there's little use in wasting your surplus on them.
[03:13:05] <biys> so if a person steals a loaf of bread to feed their kids, for example, they should be punished because they obtained something outside the normal confines of how it should typically be obtained, thus harming society
[03:13:15] <causative> no, I wouldn't consider that harming society
[03:13:22] <causative> <causative> I am speaking of crimes in the metaphorical, moral sense here
[03:13:28] <tomathy> biys: if you punish that person you will find karma knocking on the door very hard
[03:13:30] <causative> it's not immoral to steal bread if you are starving
[03:13:44] <biys> so it's okay for a bum to rob a bank then?
[03:14:01] <causative> no, it is immoral to rob a bank even if you are starving
[03:14:10] <biys> but not steal bread
[03:14:29] <causative> quite a difference between stealing basic sustenance and threatening people with violence to acquire lots of cash
[03:14:31] <tomathy> stealing bread is a bad example because in modernity there is surplus
[03:14:35] <thunder> the karma bogeyman is a just world fallacy. karma is a reference to your conscience, which is why it can be transcended through meditation.
[03:14:39] <tomathy> and supermarket waste is huge
[03:14:57] <biys> it's the thought of theft really
[03:15:00] <causative> when I say something is immoral, I am speaking of whether it harms or benefits society
[03:15:08] <tomathy> thunder: i was being unphilosophical and emotional when i said that
[03:15:10] <causative> stealing bread to feed your family causes more good than it does harm
[03:15:11] <biys> the mental gymnastics required to see it as theft in one circumstance but not theft in another
[03:15:17] <causative> robbing a bank harms society more than it helps you
[03:15:27] <causative> it's theft in both circumstances
[03:15:31] <thunder> tomathy: I get it
[03:15:43] <causative> I never said it wasn't theft in either circumstance
[03:15:58] <biys> you're treating the act of theft differently in each circumstance though
[03:16:09] <causative> yes, not all thefts are equally bad
[03:16:12] <causative> some can even be good
[03:16:23] <biys> but it's causing harm in some way or another
[03:16:30] <biys> the harm might be more or less
[03:16:30] <tomathy> if the banks are engaged in crime then what's wrong with stealing from them?
[03:16:32] <biys> but it's still harm
[03:16:34] <causative> but it may cause more benefit to society than harm
[03:16:39] <biys> may
[03:16:41] <causative> the harm must be balanced against the benefit
[03:16:41] <biys> may not
[03:16:48] <biys> perceived benefit?
[03:16:55] <causative> in the case of stealing bread to feed your starving family, the benefit is much greater than the merchant's loss
[03:17:05] <biys> not to the merchant perhaps
[03:17:09] <causative> to society as a whole
[03:17:13] <thunder> concepts of human rights are always in tension between ideas of property vs ideas of need. naturally need trumps property. but it's not as cut and dry as property, and when the two come into conflict in a propertarian society, it generally results in persecution of the needy.
[03:17:24] <causative> always when I speak of good and bad, moral or immoral, I am evaluating the benefit or harm to society as a whole
[03:17:43] <biys> well you're assuming that the person who's stealing the bread is going to raise their children so they're a benefit to society in some way or another
[03:17:48] <biys> it very well could be they're raising criinals
[03:17:50] <biys> criminals
[03:18:23] <biys> the apple tends not fall far frmo the tree
[03:18:25] <causative> well, the analysis does need to factor that in, but a child raised starving is going to generally be less value to society than a child who had adequate nutrition
[03:18:38] <causative> childhood starvation causes low IQ which causes crime
[03:19:04] <causative> and the parent is not exactly a hardened criminal if he only steals because he and his family are starving
[03:19:11] <causative> you would steal bread too if you were starving - anyone would
[03:19:16] <thunder> "ask for work. if they don't give you work, ask for bread. if they do not give you work or bread, then take bread." --emma goldman
[03:19:26] <biys> we're hyper speculating about the scenario and moving it around to fit the narrative we want to subscribe to i'd say
[03:19:39] <I_Am_M00t> :)
[03:19:48] <causative> you haven't justified that conclusion
[03:19:52] <I_Am_M00t> speaking of narratives
[03:20:17] <biys> i'm still hung up on the idea that an admirable goal is that of harm reduction across all variables
[03:20:30] <biys> i don't necessarily think that is even a slightly attainable goal
[03:20:32] <I_Am_M00t> :)
[03:20:34] <thunder> people are raised on this good-guy vs bad-guy mythology/trope. real life isn't that black and white. just having a lot of money doesn't make you a good person, nor does breaking the law for survival necessarily make you a bad one.
[03:20:50] <causative> the word "admirable" is one you used, not me
[03:20:56] <biys> necessary?
[03:20:57] <tomathy> not much philosophy happening here
[03:21:06] <causative> I didn't call it necessary either
[03:21:10] <tomathy> let's focus on needs and desires and their relationship
[03:21:46] <causative> I am explaining that a goal *I want* is for people to act in a way that benefits society as a whole
[03:21:50] *** Joins: fructose (~fructose@user/fructose)
[03:21:50] <biys> oooh
[03:21:52] <biys> okay
[03:21:54] <causative> and perhaps it is a goal you want as well
[03:21:55] <biys> beg your pardon
[03:22:15] <biys> do you know where this idea originated in yuor mind at all?
[03:22:21] <biys> where/how ?
[03:22:22] <causative> probably instinct
[03:22:36] <biys> so a biological inclination?
[03:22:37] <I_Am_M00t> maybe it had christian origins?
[03:22:47] <causative> people have a natural tendency to want things to be fair, to punish transgressors and have everything work smoothly
[03:22:58] <biys> is that Jaque Panksepp ?
[03:23:03] <causative> in my case christian origins are unlikely since I was not raised christian
[03:23:17] <I_Am_M00t> right
[03:23:18] <causative> I'd say that the desire for things to be fair is cross-cultural
[03:23:37] <biys> i would say that people do not have a natural tendency to want to do things fairly.  which is why people cheat and lie and steal
[03:23:43] <biys> it's built into it
[03:23:44] <causative> not everybody is the same
[03:23:55] <causative> and not everybody has the same formative experiences
[03:23:55] <biys> you're void of cheating?   lying?  stealing?
[03:24:04] <causative> more so than most
[03:24:12] <thunder> need is difficult to define in absolute terms. if you consider it purely in a biological sense, then you could say a person has their needs met while strapped to a chair and force fed nutrition to keep them alive. how much does one need freedom, or comfort, or companionship? where exactly is the line? personally I regard it as a point of contemplation when considering my consumer behaviours, but I can't pretend to speak for others. that's why
[03:24:12] <thunder> property tends to be more clear cut and in practice trumps need in propertarian societies. it's much easier to define in absolute terms.
[03:24:28] <causative> there are always degrees, gradations
[03:24:44] <causative> when we speak of human nature it is not "Everyone is X" - it is always "some people are more X, some people are less X"
[03:24:53] <biys> well, it looks like i've found who can cast the first stone
[03:25:11] <causative> I think in large part it depends on how you form your ego
[03:25:15] <biys> the pure, unspotted lamb
[03:25:51] <causative> do you feel proud at getting what you can for yourself no matter what, do you have a successful history of doing that and build on that success, so that it makes you feel good when you succeed again at that?
[03:25:57] <causative> then you will behave immorally - your pride is wrapped up in it
[03:26:28] <causative> conversely, pride can be built in the other direction - pride for not compromising your principles, for doing what is right even though it hurts you again and again - this builds another kind of pride and another kind of ego
[03:26:42] <causative> and then you will behave morally - your pride is wrapped up in it
[03:26:45] <tomathy> i've got a great idea for a novel
[03:27:05] <biys> i feel neither one way or another
[03:27:13] <biys> i am indifferent
[03:27:39] <causative> then perhaps you have a different type of psychology
[03:27:54] <causative> I couldn't really speculate on what it might be without knowing you better
[03:29:09] <thunder> there's also the philosophical question of one's right to the products of their own labour, and their lack thereof when they do not take opportunity to provide for themself as needed. on the other hand, having been on the bottom rung an appreciable percentage of my life, I know that under that rung is a hole made from the footprints of people trying to get to the bottom rung form in the first place.
[03:29:09] <biys> it's an interesting idea thuogh
[03:29:32] <biys> to think that the world/universe is supposed to be in any particular way or another that we can think with our limited understanding of such
[03:29:44] <causative> you cannot escape that biys
[03:29:59] <I_Am_M00t> i find it silly that carbon and methane taxes arent well implemented
[03:30:05] <causative> if you're hungry, you'd rather the world be in a way that you have and eat a sandwich, than the world be in some other way
[03:30:10] <biys> then to take it one step further... it's weird to find a person who thinks they can undersatnd the concepts as they'd play out through time and space
[03:30:16] <I_Am_M00t> the air is treated like a dumpster
[03:30:23] <causative> everybody has preferences for how they want the world to be
[03:30:28] <biys> sure
[03:30:30] <I_Am_M00t> yet we rely on it for survival
[03:30:43] <biys> and some of those people aer more or less willing to suggest it's "the way"
[03:31:11] <causative> what would make them unwilling to tell other people about how they want the world to be?
[03:31:33] <biys> oh.  you they can tell anyone anything they want now days
[03:31:35] <biys> the proof is in the pudding
[03:31:46] <tomathy> The brick came tumbling down through the sky. Its origins were uncertain, but as it turned it swirled almost merrily, cutting through the wind and whistling as it fell, and fell, and kept on falling. It approach a green hill at incredible speed, but due to the angle of the hill, the brick didn't break at all. In some strange unexpected way, the brick just slid, since the hill was wet and angled in the direction it was falling - there was no damage on
[03:31:46] <tomathy> either side. It kept sliding and the heat it gave off from this speed warmed the wetness, and the sliding stopped, and so did the brick.
[03:31:53] <I_Am_M00t> the COP26 didn't really get anywhere in terms of carbon taxing, right?
[03:32:25] <tomathy> this is the start of my "beingless" novel
[03:32:36] <I_Am_M00t> how can you expect change without changing economic incentives? it's fantasy land
[03:32:52] <causative> well, it's only fear and lack of confidence, I think, that keeps some people from telling other people about the way the world "should" be (in their opinion)
[03:33:13] <causative> most people are eager to tell other people about the way the world "should" be (in their opinion); look at social media
[03:33:17] <biys> I_Am_M00t: the problem with carbon tax and global warming is it'll take greater than 50 years to see if anything we've done or have been doing is going to do results in any kind of significant change
[03:33:34] <biys> that isn't to say we can't do anything
[03:33:41] <thunder> in indigenous societies in the region I live, one is not traditionally considered an adult until they have demonstrated their ability to live off the land self-sufficiently. if you think about it, we spend our infancy and childhood mostly dependent, the last part as elderly also, and a good chunk of time in between while we're sick or otherwise engaged in non-productive work. so a majority of society needs to be not only self-sufficient, but
[03:33:41] <thunder> providing a surplus to care for dependents. in urban societies from an indigenous point of view, we are all children who cannot care for ourselves and do not understand the consequences of what it takes to do so.
[03:33:46] <biys> but i think the over 200 goals are a little misguided
[03:34:00] <I_Am_M00t> the carbon tax is obviously needed
[03:34:29] <biys> i would say that the way we view each other is what requires the change
[03:34:30] <biys> personally
[03:34:42] <biys> then the rest will kind of just... fall in place

[03:36:49] <causative> taking action to stop it costs an individual actor some amount X, and gains all n actors Y each; n * Y > X, so the action if taken is beneficial for all, but X < Y, so no actor has the incentive to take action himself

[03:41:47] <causative> thunder, even on a national level there is tragedy of the commons
[03:41:47] <thunder> consumers need to take more responsibility for their food supply chain
[03:42:17] <causative> no nation has an incentive to enact military policy on climate change, because it's going to cost that country more than it selfishly gains - even though it benefits all countries more than the cost to that one country

[03:44:51] <thunder> when a government makes environmental regulations, they usually squeeze in some wiggle room and financial residuals by making it possible for corporations to get a license to pollute or otherwise abandon public lands in a worse state than they found them. now instead of suing the corporation, the effected are forced to sue the government. guess who wins/loses?
[03:46:08] <causative> environmental regulations are about making a show to gain public support rather than actually doing anything
[03:46:20] <causative> at least when it comes to climate change
[03:46:41] <thunder> they're counter productive because they eradicate the only viable enforcement mechanism available to the public/effected.

[06:15:00] <causative> thinking out loud a little:  a belief system consists of a set of propositions P held by a mind at a particular time. A subset R of the propositions are "rules." Each rule operates on the contents of "short-term memory" - a small set of propositions. There may be several kinds of rules, at minimum two.  1. An inference rule allows us to form a conclusion proposition from a small set of premise propositions, where the conclusion depends on the
[06:15:01] <causative> premises. 2. A contradiction rule says when a small set of propositions contradict each other.
[06:16:25] <biys> hmm
[06:16:46] <biys> i don't know what you mean by the subset portion
[06:16:52] <causative> the belief system is consistent if it is not possible to use the inference rules to derive a contradiction. It may be justified by a smaller set of premises, when those premises combined with the inference rules in the premises allow us to reconstruct the belief system.
[06:17:15] <causative> R is a subset of P biys
[06:17:26] <causative> that is, the rules are considered to also be propositions
[06:17:38] <biys> oooh
[06:17:40] <biys> okay duh
[06:17:41] <biys> sry
[06:18:15] <biys> can you give an example of a rule that operates on the contents of short term memory?
[06:19:16] <causative> "If a properly motivated horse races a human on foot on a five mile track, the horse will probably win."
[06:19:30] <biys> properly motivated
[06:19:31] <biys> hah
[06:20:14] <causative> we need to incorporate default or defeasible reasoning into this framework
[06:20:35] <biys> idk if the propositions are necessarily held in the mind
[06:20:44] <biys> as much as the tradition of upholding the proposition
[06:20:45] <biys> TBH
[06:21:06] <causative> a belief system must be something where you can grasp the inference steps involved
[06:21:13] <causative> for that to happen, the steps have to fit into your short term memory
[06:21:42] <causative> otherwise they do not provide evidence leading you to believe them
[06:21:59] <biys> which is why i'm saying what i say

[06:29:06] <causative> perhaps we can model defeasible reasoning by just adding an assumption that "conditions are normal"
[06:29:23] <causative> i.e. "If a properly motivated horse (under normal conditions) races a human on foot on a five mile track, the horse will probably win."
[06:30:01] <causative> but we also want to assume that unless stated otherwise, conditions are probably normal
[06:37:07] <causative> perhaps we can simply annotate each application of an inference rule with a set of other applications of inference rules that it "defeats"
[06:38:16] <causative> so, "If a properly motivated horse with a broken leg races a human on foot on a five mile track, the human will probably win." is a rule that defeats "If a properly motivated horse races a human on foot on a five mile track, the horse will probably win."  And we just include both rules and note when one defeats the other.  And a defeated rule cannot be used in that instance.
[06:39:43] <causative> anyway, the point of all this is to develop a way to talk about how humans actually form systems of beliefs, suitable for modeling elenchus (the process of questioning and finding contradictions or unjustified claims in a belief system)
[06:40:07] <causative> as opposed to the typical approach in logic of beginning from axioms and proceeding only by deduction
[06:41:02] <causative> humans begin with lots of propositions already held, and try to draw a hopefully consistent structure between these propositions already held, to justify them
[06:41:56] <causative> we begin with a mess of beliefs "in the middle" and work both backwards and forwards, rather than starting from clean axioms "at the beginning"
[06:43:28] <tomathy> what
[06:44:21] <tomathy> oh i see
[06:44:31] <tomathy> you are saying nobody is perfectly logical or whatever
[06:44:49] <tomathy> but the proof is in the pudding as they say. logic has made machines
[06:45:28] <causative> logic is useful, but deductive logic is not the way we think, and the way we think is also very useful
[06:45:57] <tomathy> how do we think? analytical?
[06:46:46] <causative> human thoughts are fuzzy, probabilistic, approximate, default/defeasible, and sometimes a matter of preference or appeal
[06:46:48] <tomathy> it seems to me that deductions form a large part of human thinking
[06:47:22] <causative> humans hardly ever perform pure deductions, unless they are actually working in a pure deductive subject such as math or logic
[06:47:50] <tomathy> so when it rains, and your sister says she's just come back from a run, but she's not wet. do you just accept it?
[06:48:11] <causative> no, and that's not a pure deduction
[06:48:23] <tomathy> why not?
[06:48:29] <causative> perhaps the rain was localized and she was outside the area where it was raining
[06:48:36] <causative> perhaps she was running in the local gymnasium
[06:48:50] <causative> perhaps she carried an umbrella and raincoat which she changed out of
[06:49:30] <tomathy> so you as a inquisitive human would seek out one of these things, unless you had more important things to think about
[06:49:47] <causative> to say that she couldn't have been running because it was raining and she's not wet, is an example of *defeasible* reasoning; it makes sense and is probable, but there are special conditions that could demonstrate that it's wrong
[06:50:04] <causative> even if I did check all those things there are still more ways
[06:50:19] <causative> maybe she was running in the basement, or jogging in place
[06:50:34] <causative> maybe the town has an underground tunnel system that I've somehow never heard about, which she was jogging through
[06:50:58] <causative> maybe she is naturally immune to rain as a basic law of physics, which again I've never heard about but that doesn't make it impossible
[06:51:07] <tomathy> have you not deduced all of these things from my statements?
[06:51:14] <causative> deduced what?
[06:51:20] <tomathy> and your knowledge of the world?
[06:51:25] <tomathy> all these things you're saying
[06:51:27] <causative> everything I've said is prefaced by a "maybe"
[06:51:33] <causative> that's not what you do in pure deduction
[06:51:48] <tomathy> so saying maybe before something means i haven't deduced what i've just said?
[06:52:27] <tomathy> that seems trite
[06:52:29] <causative> if you say "maybe X," you haven't deduced X.  If you want to say you've deduced "maybe X," then you are probably talking about modal logic - anyway, not the typical logic systems used in mathematics
[06:52:41] <causative> some alternative logic system at the very least
[06:52:57] <causative> "maybe X" is defeasible
[06:53:12] <causative> because there could be evidence Y, where after you see Y, you conclude "definitely not X"
[06:53:24] <causative> so is "maybe X" still deductively true, after you've later concluded "definitely not X"?
[06:54:00] <causative> surely it's not
[06:54:27] <causative> so the truth value of "maybe X" can become false over time - this is again not what happens in pure deduction

[06:55:24] <causative> we also call this "non-monotone" reasoning - where the truth value of a proposition can switch back and forth as we process more evidence
[06:57:07] <tomathy> so when you said "maybe she was running in a basement" how did you decide that that could be possible ?
[06:58:11] <causative> how humans decide such things is quite a puzzle
[06:58:20] <tomathy> you noticed she is dry, therefore she must have been somewhere dry, and basements are dry from falling rain, so you deduced she may have been in a basement
[06:58:46] <causative> I just told you why it can't be pure deduction - it's defeasible

[06:59:38] <tomathy> not sure what you're talking about with this defeasible stuff
[07:00:02] <tomathy> if you get new information, whatever has been deduced can be contradicted surely?
[07:00:11] <causative> in defeasible reasoning, we may conclude initially that X is true, and then later we find some more evidence that *defeats* X, so that now we think X is false
[07:00:28] <causative> (and maybe still more evidence can defeat the earlier evidence, so that we might again think X is true)
[07:00:47] <causative> and no, in pure deduction, what has been deduced once is true forever
[07:01:20] <causative> pure deduction deals with conclusions that *necessarily* follow from the premises - this means there is no possibility the conclusion could ever be disproved, assuming the premises are true
[07:01:22] <tomathy> i see a flaw in your argument
[07:01:33] <tomathy> you said "maybe X" is defeasible, but it is not
[07:01:50] <tomathy> the truth value of "maybe X" remains true even if X is definitely false
[07:02:01] <tomathy> surely?
[07:02:10] <causative> I wouldn't say so
[07:02:34] <causative> "maybe X" would be meaningless then, if it could hold regardless of whether X is true and regardless of what evidence proves or disproves X
[07:02:42] <causative> but it's not meaningless
[07:02:42] <tomathy> but 1 or 0 is true
[07:02:53] <causative> "1 or 0" is true and vacuous
[07:02:58] <causative> "maybe X" is not vacuous
[07:03:30] <causative> "maybe X" is a statement about what is reasonable at the present time to consider as a possibility - the reasonableness of considering X as a possibility may change or vanish as more evidence arises
[07:04:05] <causative> "reasonableness" here is a function both of X and of the *mental state* of the inquirer
[07:06:33] <tomathy> ok let's say i run over a dog, and i say "maybe it was a badger"
[07:07:10] <tomathy> now i get arrested for it, and it turns out it was not a dog, or a badger
[07:07:18] <tomathy> it was a toy badger, like a teddy bear
[07:07:39] <tomathy> the teddy police arrest me and question me and i find out
[07:08:02] <tomathy> now we have to determine if a teddy badger is a badger or not
[07:08:09] <tomathy> sorry im a bit tired
[07:08:41] <tomathy> but the police say "it was definitely not a badger"
[07:08:46] <tomathy> we are the teddy police!
[07:09:05] <tomathy> therefore according to you it was a dog right?
[07:09:21] <tomathy> :P
[07:09:36] <tomathy> i dont know if that's a seious argument or not im tired
[07:10:59] <causative> once you found out it wasn't a badger, "maybe it's a badger" became (mostly) false
[07:11:40] <tomathy> but with your assertion of maybe X being false is X is false, we're now stuck in the narrative of the corrupt teddy police!
[07:13:37] <tomathy> i just believe "maybe X" is always true is all im saying no matter the value of X but i dont know why im arguing for this
[07:15:27] <causative> "maybe x" is false if x is *known* to be false - x being false, by itself, is not enough to make "maybe x" false

[22:11:38] <bbbbb> hey audrey!
[22:22:05] <biys> super interesting to me how people in my life argue
[22:22:20] <biys> not that i enjoy arguing with people that are in my life
[22:22:22] <biys> but it happens
[22:23:00] <biys> the lack of logic and how the argument swings from this point to that, as you attempt to drive down each avenue of their argument you find how unformulated th eir arguments actually are
[22:23:11] <biys> which actually seems to make them even more upset when pointed out
[22:24:24] <biys> completely unrelated example would be something like.  i don't like un-neceesary items cluttering the counter tops.  i will tend to make a comment here or there if peopel leave significant amounts of dishes on the counter instead of putting them in the dish washer or dealing with them accordingly
[22:24:57] <biys> their response would be something like "yesterday you left your cup out after you had a drink of water, so it's therefore entirely okay that i leave all my dishes on the counter"
[22:25:16] <biys> to which i usually respond.  "did you pick up my cup?  did you put it away?"
[22:25:19] <biys> no
[22:25:30] <biys> "did you end up picking up your dishes and dealing with your dishes?"
[22:25:31] <biys> no
[22:25:57] <biys> i find the longer i'm alive the less i understand people
[22:26:05] <biys> i thought it would be the other way around
[22:26:40] <biys> the longer i also know people the weirder they tend to get to me
[22:28:46] <bbbbb> biys are you expecting other people to think the same way you do? Or have the same priorities?
[22:29:17] <biys> not at all.  i'm expecting the people who are part of the house to take part in maintaining the hosue and it's function, however
[22:29:51] <biys> if you occupy a space with another person i think it's not unreasonable to help maintain that space
[22:31:10] <bbbbb> I agree, but I've found people have very different ideas on what is acceptable in regards to cleaning and tidying
[22:31:46] <biys> sure!
[22:32:14] <biys> i don't think it's unreasonable to expect a person not to drop their clothes on the floor where-ever they took them off and leave them for weeks or months
[22:32:44] <biys> or once you've finished eating, assist with clearing your dishes (the ones you used) from the table
[22:32:55] <biys> IMO it comes down to a position of mutual respect
[22:34:43] <bbbbb> have you tried saying that you feel disrespected when they leave their mess for you to clean up?
[22:36:56] <biys> the mental gymnastics are amazing
[22:37:11] <biys> the thing about it is... one portion of the family is kind of hoarders

[22:37:29] <biys> in the sense that their basement has small passages one can walk to navigate the "collection" of items
[22:37:39] <biys> i wouldn't say i'm anti consumerist
[22:37:48] <biys> but i do live minimally for the most part
[22:38:03] <biys> the other side seems to be of the impression that if it's on sale it should be purchase
[22:38:12] <biys> "cause you never know when you're gonna need it"
[22:38:18] <biys> so the amount of clutter is significant
[22:38:32] <Delf> Do you do most of the maintaining of the dishes?
[22:38:45] <biys> i do almost all the cleaning and organizing
[22:38:51] <biys> 95% of it
[22:38:56] <Delf> Holy fuck
[22:39:24] <biys> i can literally follow these peopel around daily and make a full time job of cleaning up after them
[22:39:31] <biys> if not, the house would be an absolute disaster
[22:39:36] <Delf> I do my part and a little of other's part. I refuse to do more than that.
[22:40:00] <biys> well there's children involved.  the cruiser is at the point where she needs to taste everything
[22:40:13] <biys> and i constantly have to remind the SO that if she leaves stuff laying around the girl WILL TRY AND EAT IT
[22:40:20] <biys> she seems to have little regard
[22:40:33] <Delf> I ha no problem doing more than that before. But sicne I got told off that I don't do my part, took doing others parts to a minimum
[22:40:55] <biys> that would likely cause me a significant amount of discomfort personally
[22:41:07] <biys> i actually start feeling fucky if the house is significantly dirty
[22:41:09] <biys> i can't focus
[22:41:16] <biys> i have to clean
[22:41:38] <biys> don't get me wrong.  i'm not like my mother who vacuums three times a day
[22:42:17] <biys> but if the house isn't significantly clean i have to do something about it
[22:42:22] <biys> it's a compulsion more than likely
[22:42:25] <Delf> If you keep cleaning after them, you make it unnecessary for them to clean afther themselves
[22:42:38] <biys> haha.  so here's the thing about that
[22:42:44] <biys> we go to her parents house every now and again
[22:42:56] <biys> and her parents leave dishes all over the place
[22:42:57] <Delf> You must because there's a kid involved...
[22:43:07] <biys> the bathrooms, the bedrooms, etc
[22:43:11] <bbbbb> biys It sounds like a nightmare.
[22:43:12] <biys> there is dishes stacked in ever room
[22:43:13] <Delf> You got yourself into the shit mate....
[22:43:14] <biys> i don't think it's clean
[22:43:35] <biys> i wasn't aware of how big of slobs they were accustom to living like
[22:44:01] <biys> i jumped into her van last week for a bit of a road trip
[22:44:10] <biys> and there was rotten bananas squished into the floor

[22:47:59] <biys> i wasn't allowed to go out unless my space was clean
[22:49:17] <bbbbb> I think they dont see it. I live with someone who loves to leave clutter on every surface, and doesnt have a set place for anything
[22:49:58] <bbbbb> They told me it doesn't bother them
[22:51:30] <bbbbb> The only thing that helped was telling them it made me mentally exhausted and I couldnt relax, and even if they didnt care, could they clean up for my sake
[22:51:45] <Delf> What I don't understand is when one tells me to pick up after myself when they don't
[22:52:05] <bbbbb> its half worked..

[22:54:03] <biys> it's my wife

[22:54:37] <bbbbb> ha thats a definite yes then
[22:54:47] <biys> between a 3 year old and a 1year old and maintaining a house entirely myself as well as trying to accomplish schooling
[22:54:52] <biys> i'm kind of anoyed
[22:55:11] <biys> she just kind of peaces out for long periods of time when she's not working "i haev to go wash my hair"
[22:55:30] <biys> the time that she is available she'll only pick one child or the other to hang out with
[22:55:38] <biys> and the other is just plopped and left
[22:55:56] <bbbbb> this sounds like a 1950s marriage
[22:55:59] <biys> we just recently moved too
[22:56:04] <biys> i packed up the house
[22:56:08] <biys> loaded it into the moving trailer
[22:56:14] <biys> i unpacked the trailer
[22:56:21] <biys> i unpacked all the boxes and organized the new house

[22:58:58] <bbbbb> was she tidy before having kids?
[22:59:12] <biys> yes
[22:59:20] <biys> and as for what she does when she's not working...
[22:59:34] <biys> idk.  looking at her phone, avoiding the children
[22:59:38] <biys> "cooking"
[22:59:49] <biys> which usually involves creating a giant mess and leaving it for me to clean
[23:00:20] <bbbbb> Has she got post natal depression?
[23:00:47] <biys> i find she has no real emotions other than anger
[23:00:58] <biys> and the anger is usually as a result of me asking her to help out
[23:01:18] <bbbbb> to be fair, two young kids plus two adults in a house full time is going to create a lot of mess
[23:01:46] <biys> the othe rpart of it is

[23:03:07] <Ungwelian> biys, you sound like you have quite a bit of resentment with the situation.
[23:03:24] <biys> i'm just sad that the situation has come to what it is
[23:03:32] <Ungwelian> Is she happy?
[23:03:56] <biys> tbh i have no clue.  she can't talk without performing a significant amount of mental gymnastics
[23:04:05] <Ungwelian> Have you asked her?
[23:04:09] <biys> tons
[23:04:25] <Ungwelian> What does she answer?
[23:04:31] <biys> she kind of jsut shrugs her shoulders and says "it doesn't bug me"
[23:04:38] <biys> i found a safety pin on the floro the other day
[23:04:46] <biys> i was like "if your daughter finds these and eats them that is bad:
[23:04:51] <biys> she's like "it's not a big deal"
[23:05:09] <Ungwelian> I'd agree with you there: it is a big deal.
[23:05:23] <biys> i found paper clips on the floor
[23:05:32] <biys> and i was like "you need to make sure you aren't leaving stuff like this around"
[23:05:40] <biys> the girl chews on shoes if you leave them out
[23:05:45] <biys> so i put the shoes away
[23:05:50] <biys> the wife has no regard and constantly leaves her shoes out

[23:06:36] <biys> the moment i start questioning her about her involvement in the space she gets livid
[23:06:49] <Ungwelian> So I guess she considers you a controlling person.

[23:15:18] <Delf> Relationship jumpers?
[23:15:47] <Ungwelian> I'd say it's an existential & moral problem with the structure of modern life.
[23:16:06] <Ungwelian> People don't spend time to develop a solid foundation for their values.
[23:16:11] <bbbbb> All my friends who had kids were an absolute mess for the first few years. Their houses were a mess, their emotions were in tatters, they did anything to get away from it all
[23:16:39] <Ungwelian> Yeah, that too. It's a big step.
[23:16:54] <Ungwelian> Might be, biys, that you're coping with it better, because you're naturally a structured person.
[23:17:10] <Ungwelian> For her, it's harder.
[23:18:30] <Delf> They don't need to spend time to develop their values even, they can find them in the phone, in instagram etc
[23:18:42] <Ungwelian> Hehe :)
[23:18:47] <Ungwelian> At least they try.
[23:18:53] <Delf> Nah.. they don't even do that
[23:19:06] <Delf> It's rather a consequence that the values get transmitted

[23:20:15] <Delf> Can't live up to your own values? Example?

[23:21:40] <Ungwelian> I keep thinking of gatherer-hunter societies at times like this. Basically you have a kindergarten right outside your doorstep.
[23:22:09] <bbbbb> Delf say, you value showing respect for your partner. But then you become ill or exhausted and do things that they find disrespectful, like be messy or lose your temper
[23:22:10] <Ungwelian> And kids are under care of many adults at all times.

[23:28:49] <biys> because before we had kids i asked her a lot of these questions
[23:28:55] <biys> i said "why do you think you want kids?"
[23:30:36] <Delf> If a male flares up, they're considered mentally disturbed. If a female flares up, that's just.. normal. No?
[23:31:24] <biys> haha
[23:31:27] <biys> i ain't touching that
[23:31:49] <biys> but iirc there are a few cases where women got off of significant charges as a result of the womanly condition
[23:31:53] <Delf> I'll get gutted for asking :P
[23:34:42] <biys> i often ask her why she thinks she has the ideas that she has
[23:34:54] <biys> and it's amazing to me how many people aren't sure why they have the ideas they have
[23:35:16] <biys> they just hold the ideas in their mind without actually understanding the underpinning or the origin
[23:35:18] <bbbbb> Anger is normal, acting inappropriately in anger is not normal for anyone
[23:35:47] *** Quits: mannequin (uid453465@helmsley.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[23:35:49] <biys> she does seem as though she's trying very hard to keep up with the jones
[23:36:03] <biys> there is a significant amount of image associated with what she does
[23:36:10] <biys> like if we go hiking i throw on some jeans and my work boots
[23:36:18] <biys> she actually buys special clothes for hiking
[23:36:25] <biys> and she doesn't even like hiking
[23:36:42] <biys> where as i'll do a 40km through hike without blinking an eye
[23:36:46] <biys> with a kid on my back
[23:37:16] <biys> if we wanna go for a bike-ride, i'll just throw on my shoes and whatever i'm wearing
[23:37:23] <biys> she has to put on an entire outfit
[23:37:29] <bbbbb> maybe she just likes buying clothes
[23:38:06] <biys> well IIRC
[23:38:14] <biys> i remember reading this book my Wolfgang Streeck
[23:38:32] <biys> and it's something liike "surviving post-capitalism: coping, hoping, doping & shopping"
[23:39:02] <Ungwelian> Did you spend a lot of time together before starting a family?
[23:39:08] <biys> i would say that the constant need people have to buy stuff is kind of like a tactic that people use to confront uncertainty and feel good about themselves
[23:39:17] <biys> Ungwelian: my wife and i dated for 14 years prior to getting married
[23:39:23] <Ungwelian> That's a while.
[23:39:33] <biys> then we had kids after getting married
[23:39:37] <biys> cause you can't have kids out of wedlock
[23:39:38] <Ungwelian> Anything favourite you liked to do together?
[23:39:43] <bbbbb> absolutely biys  (re buying stuff)
[23:40:18] <biys> Ungwelian: watch movies, go hiking, snowboard, bike
[23:40:38] <Ungwelian> Quite active :)
[23:40:47] <biys> her biggest problem for the longest time was i still had a group of friends that i consorted with "the boys"
[23:40:53] <biys> i have completely abandonded "the boys"
[23:41:16] <biys> and now she's not really interested in hiking or snowboarding anymore
[23:41:40] <Ungwelian> How about eating out at restaurants?
[23:41:46] <bbbbb> join a hiking group
[23:41:56] *** Joins: shibboleth (~shibbolet@user/shibboleth)
[23:41:59] <biys> no.  restaurants are terrible.  i'm not a fan at all of restarants
[23:42:08] <Ungwelian> Is she?
[23:42:11] <biys> no
[23:42:26] <biys> my wife is very frugal with money, except when it comes to buying clothes
[23:42:28] <biys> all the clothes
[23:42:31] <biys> every clothes
[23:42:33] <Ungwelian> :D
[23:42:53] <Ungwelian> I'd have suggested you do something together, where she can unwind an be as messy as she likes.
[23:43:07] <Ungwelian> And you don't need to care about dishes after restaurants.
[23:43:24] <biys> well.  that involves me having to essentially do a significant portion of the work to facilitate that
[23:43:47] <Ungwelian> Yep.
[23:43:50] <biys> i'll have to come up with the idea of what to do
[23:43:57] <bbbbb> wait...why did she want kids? Did she tell you?
[23:43:57] <biys> i'll have to organize it
[23:44:25] <biys> bbbbb: as best i can understand the image she has in her mind of who she is is based on the idea of what she believes people do
[23:44:31] <biys> not as a result of what she wants to do
[23:44:36] <biys> "this is what people do"
[23:44:37] <Ungwelian> It'll be extra work for you. However, as a result she might get something she needs and have more energy & better mood afterwards.

[23:44:59] <biys> i think she's caught up in the image
[23:45:07] <biys> and she hasn't actually determined if it's what she actually wants
[23:45:13] <biys> it's just the image she thinks she's supposed to have
[23:45:29] <biys> i hear it all the time from mutual friends that are currently single or don't have kids
[23:45:35] <biys> they all feel like their "biological clock is ticking"
[23:45:44] <biys> they all talk about "not finding their soul mate"
[23:46:00] <biys> the thing about that is... when you're almost 40...  the person you find is likely going to have as much baggage as you do
[23:46:14] <biys> so it's probably going to be a problematic relationship from the get-go
[23:46:42] <Ungwelian> I actually find that dating is much easier when older.
[23:46:57] <biys> i got a buddy that i talk with maybe once a month or so who's constantly talking about finding a "niec traditional girl he can settle down and have kids with"
[23:47:03] <biys> and i'm like "yah, good luck with that"
[23:47:06] <Delf> Ungwelian: Only if you happen to be a female
[23:47:24] <Ungwelian> As a late teen, I had absolutely no idea about correct behaviour in relationships.
[23:47:52] <Ungwelian> Now, I do.
[23:48:09] <biys> don't get me wrong.  i know i'm not all peaches and gravy to live with
[23:48:13] <biys> i entirely have my faults
[23:48:25] <Delf> I have none!
[23:48:25] <biys> but it seems like i'm the only one attempting to come up with solutions
[23:48:39] <biys> i'm the only one putting an effort into the family thing
[23:48:44] <biys> she's here... but she isn't HERE

[23:49:23] <biys> i don't want this to be a pitty party either
[23:49:25] <Ungwelian> Like bbbbb says, it might be that she's overwhelmed. The whole family thing is harder for her.
[23:49:28] <biys> i'm just working through it
[23:50:02] <biys> like i said to her, "i'll take the girl and run to the store and you just have the boy to deal with for right now, is that okay?"
[23:50:04] <Delf> Or biys is recognized as the source of her emotional problems
[23:50:20] <biys> she snapped at me "why do you need to take her?"
[23:50:29] *** Quits: medium_cool (~medium_co@2605:a601:a9aa:f800:bcec:16ea:4e73:419c) (Quit: My Mac Mini has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[23:50:33] <biys> well because you're just standing in your room doing whatever anyways and she's been in here the whole time with me
[23:50:40] <biys> the boy is watching tv
[23:50:50] <biys> so he can continue watching tv and i'll take the girl and you can continue doing whatever you want
[23:50:58] <biys> now she's wanting to take both kids with her to find a cake
[23:51:05] <biys> and i'm like "why now?"
[23:51:37] <biys> suddenly it's so important she takes both kids to go find a cake
[23:51:45] <Delf> Its you vs her. Who's the best parent? Or rather, whose the worst parent? She doesn't want to be it
[23:51:46] <biys> when she previously wasn't interested in doing anything with them
[23:51:57] <biys> until i've mentioned i wanna go get milk and some buns
[23:52:19] <Ungwelian> Yeah, Delf might be right. Sometimes in relationships you can have this weird contest dynamic.
[23:52:26] *** Joins: trbp (~trbp@user/trbp)
[23:52:30] <Ungwelian> Like a family of two enemies.
[23:52:50] <Delf> Ungwelian: I hate being right...
[23:52:56] <Ungwelian> And sometimes it's just one who thinks there's an enemy.
[23:53:17] <Delf> It's fucking war... diplomatic sick war games.
[23:53:44] <Delf> You think you're playing a co-op game mean while they're playing you and they're game is a versus one.
[23:54:15] <Delf> You see "we"... they see "me".
[23:55:14] <Ungwelian> What can help with that is a frank talk, unless the other person just refuses to talk.
[23:55:32] <Ungwelian> Unresolved issues build resentment which leads into the enemy dynamic.
[23:56:12] <Delf> Yes...
[23:56:16] <Ungwelian> But then again, it might be that she had planned the cake thing in her mind.
[23:56:21] <Ungwelian> And you fucked up her plan :)
[23:56:43] <Delf> And when you try to communicate, to reach an understanding, to improve conditions... this can be seen as threat
[23:57:14] <Delf> Especially if they know that they're in the wrong, then that's it. Even if you do not seek conflict.. you're gone getting fucked.

[23:57:58] <Delf> Because that too makes it painfully obvious that they're instagating conflict and they don't want that, they rather you be that one so they will acuse you for accusing them for things
[23:59:26] <Ungwelian> You've been with some difficult women, Delf :)
[23:59:51] <Delf> Yes, I'm getting worn down
