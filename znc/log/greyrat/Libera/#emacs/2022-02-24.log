[08:49:10] <edgar-rft> Zettelkasten in principle means "crack everything down into possibly small hyperlinked pieces" - for me personally it's a horror to learn than way, but others see that differently

[08:50:39] <contrapunctus> edgar-rft: that's just what I'm talking about - if there is no optimum format, the format had better evolve out of the user's directions - and entering these directions should be almost invisible, so a document structure arises out of the act of browsing. I'm guessing the zettelkasten interfaces you've encountered haven't made the act of "entering the directions" "invisible".

[08:54:33] <edgar-rft> contrapunctus: I understand your problem, with huge manuals (what is the usual situation) the reader is *forced* to follow the author's learning-style preferences, where it sometimes would be better if the reader could adapt the document structure to his/her own needs. But I have found no better solution than to make my own poor-mans HTML manuals so far.

[11:36:50] <twb> ArneBab: the way gettext works is you just wrap all english strings in _() function.  So the code itself doesn't look too bad.  But then someone has to manually translate every string

[11:41:51] <twb> ArneBab: er... sorry, I don't understand.

[11:51:37] <ArneBab> twb: the first problem is: need to translate all menu entries with a fixed translation table.
[11:51:48] <twb> My attitude is more like "gettext method works, and is well-understood by translators, so let's do it that way"
[11:51:50] <ArneBab> trying to not make this harder than necessary :-)
[11:52:18] <ArneBab> getting stuff through code-review into Emacs can make it harder — and once such a translation exists, it can be re-used.
[11:53:02] <twb> http://ix.io/3QAS
[11:53:31] <ArneBab> We’d need to do that change for every single package that adds something to the menu
[11:53:49] <twb> ArneBab: you have to do it for *every* file, because docstrings also must be translated
[11:54:06] <twb> otherwise C-h f re-search-forward RET will return English

[11:56:04] <twb> well if you use the gettext method then most of the code is already written
[11:56:31] <twb> For example, translate.launchpad.net will allow translators to add/fix translations from their phone, without knowing any programming at all
[11:56:39] <ArneBab> I know — but I can’t apply it quickly
[11:56:40] <dpk> you could probably only translate some of Emacs into other languages anyway without major changes, thanks to rms's stupid decision back in 1982 or whenever to make command names the literal symbolic names of the functions that define the commands (unlike, say, ZWEI and Zmacs, where commands looked like ‘Execute Extended Command’ not ‘execute-extended-command’)
[11:56:55] <dpk> (rms doesn't understand indirection or encapsulation. film at 11)
[11:57:06] <twb> Sorry that should be https://translations.launchpad.net/+languages/pdc
[11:57:08] <dpk> you could make a table mapping translated command names to underlying implementation symbols …
[11:57:30] <dpk> there are also a heck of a lot of untranslated strings baked into goodness knows how many Elisp source files
[11:57:41] <twb> dpk: that is true you cannot ever fix M-x <name of function>
[11:57:50] <ArneBab> dpk: yes …
[11:58:12] <ArneBab> I don’t worry about M-x — I worry about „where is the Dateien Menu Entry?“
[11:58:23] <twb> dpk: you *can* type M-x goto line RET instead of goto-line, if you enable any of the extended M-x things, but that doesn't help translation
[11:58:26] <ArneBab> I’d like to be able to tell someone „just use the menu“
[11:58:43] <twb> ArneBab: IME most emacs users NEVER use the menu

[15:40:19] <wooster42> i'm on ubuntu 20.04 and my .emacs default font size is being overridden by something
[15:40:48] <wooster42> during init i actually see the emacs window change size a few times, and can see the second-to-last size get bigger as i raise my font size, but then it collapses back to tiny
[15:41:17] <wooster42> any hints? :)
[15:42:24] <bremner> wooster42: does the problem happen if you have a minimal .emacs containing only that setting?
[15:42:37] <wgreenhouse> wooster42: symptoms sound like trying to set default font in both emacs init and ~/.Xresources

[16:56:48] <kenran> So that means that my =some-code= elements are getting the foreground color from shadow as well. That's something I'd expect a theme to set/control though. If I want to use "the" monospace font here, should I even use :inherit or rather, knowing the font, set it via :font and skip the :inherit part? That would mean it's not sensitive to variable-pitch-mode, right?
[16:56:58] <kenran> artefact: thanks, I didn't look at that yet; going to check

[18:45:28] <bpalmer> cvandusen: I think the precedent is China (People's Republic of China) assuming its place on the security council in place of Taiwan (Republic of China); that required a vote from the general assembly.
[18:45:50] *** Joins: johnjaye (~pi@173.209.64.74)
[18:46:44] <bremner> well that turned out great, carry on.
[18:46:45] <bpalmer> cvandusen: one implication I saw mentioned is that if the Russian Federation as one of the soviet republics was fit to take over the seat, why shouldn't the GA be able to hand it to another former soviet republics instead, such as *cough* Ukraine?
[18:47:19] <bremner> seems like just trolling? hard to see a practical benefit.
[18:48:03] <bpalmer> Well, yeah. Even if Russia were kicked off the security council, they'd still have an army and nuclear weapons.
[18:49:10] <bpalmer> But since part of Putin's thing seems to be about restoring glory of the soviet days... maybe losing yet another tie to the USSR would be a consequence he cares about.
[18:49:49] <cvandusen> That's all well and good, and to jbe's point they could find other ways to eject them. I guess I'm thinking of the charter as like a contract (though, It's probably not as binding, if at all), and contracts are very specific about who the parties involved are.
[18:50:38] <Bayes> agh I woke to the news as well
[18:50:52] <bpalmer> Another amusing idea in that thread would be that if Scotland leaves the UK, maybe the UK doesn't qualify for its seat anymore.

[22:16:12] <rudybot> cvanduse`: has some amusing elements and strikes the right tone, but also bores me in that it reprises almost verbatim the tale of blowing up the Death Star--as though there's nothing for imperials and rebels to do but build expensive superweapons and blow them up, respectively

[23:26:39] <johnjaye> so it's a mixed bag
[23:26:52] <manu1> do you think the russian army is using emacs?
[23:27:11] <technomancy> johnjaye: yeah sometimes they're like "we just wanted to go out in the spaceship ok? for adventures! because spaceship."
[23:27:14] <quippy> no they'd still be sitting on the border tweaking their configs manu1
[23:27:40] <johnjaye> ironically the episode where sisko was committing war crimes in the DMZ made the most sense because it was mainly about him
[23:27:48] <johnjaye> you could remove the senior staff from the consoles and it still works
[23:27:53] <manu1> quippy: :)

[23:28:02] <johnjaye> so they should have just done that. put 1 or 2 people on the ship and have the story be about them somehow

[23:28:33] <johnjaye> i would have wanted to see odo go on some adventures related to his storyline
[23:28:45] <quippy> manu1: do you blame the manufacturer of a hammer when a psycho uses it to kill someone?
