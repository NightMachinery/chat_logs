[00:05:42] <Guest11> lets say I have a vector = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] and vector length =2 . So does that mean V1= [0,1,2,3,4] and V2 = [5,6,7,8,9] 
[00:06:24] <Guest11> I am trying to do some calculation, when i change the vector length, values get changed completely. 
[00:07:01] <Guest11> can somedbody how data is interpreted when vector length is changed in vector source?

[01:46:05] <patchvonbraun[m]> Hash: only the dish we use for 21cm spectrometry is motorized. It will be used parasitically for FRbs as well.
[02:14:21] <flash[m]> assuming I have adequate compute resources, are there scalability concerns to adding multiple blocks connected to the same output?
[02:14:38] <flash[m]> The scheduler for each block runs in the context of that thread, doesn't it?
[02:16:46] <patchvonbraun[m]> flash: I do that all the time. It’s normal. There is a specialized ring buffer shared among all the consumers of a blocks output. Which is why you never modify a blocks input. Because it’s the same buffer as the upstream blocks output.
[02:18:14] <flash[m]> the reason I ask is that I'm chasing down performance issues, and if I run with 12 channels I don't keep up, but if I run with 6 I do (where each channel consumes the same signal source)
[02:18:27] <flash[m]> but the CPU has idle cores
[02:34:28] <patchvonbraun[m]> Possibly a shared memory contention issue. Heavily multithreaded apps with shared memory are a bear to optimize.

[04:12:11] <Hash[m]> <BarryDuggan[m]> "Hash: The PDU Preamble F has..." <- Looking at the flowgraph my thought process was I have a sample rate of 96,000 so that's the rate those bits i'm sending in would flow out, so I interpolated by 10 to drop the data rate down to 9600 while still maintaining the 96,000 sample rate on the output. But open to feedback if something looks broken about that design

[04:56:59] <Hash[m]> In the PDU GSMK block, how should I think about the sensitivity value? What should drive changing that and by how much makes sense?
[04:59:20] <Hash[m]> In the source code, it adds to phase just not sure what affect that has
[05:01:00] <jholtom> Hash[m]: it looks like it is basically just doing FM modulation
[05:01:29] <jholtom> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_modulation
[05:01:33] <jholtom> so that fdelta there
[05:02:40] <jholtom> Hash[m]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum-shift_keying you can also sort of think about it like this, where its the delta betwen the two frequencies, but you do a little more in that you then filter by a gaussian
[05:02:56] <jholtom> *pre-filter by a gaussian

[11:09:54] <cow225cow[m]> Hi everyone!
[11:09:54] <cow225cow[m]> I recently upgrade my Ubuntu from 20.04 to 21.04 and a weird problem / bug about UHD happened. If I power on my notebook with USRP B200mini attached, this device cannot be seen via lsusb. The dmesg shows errors like "device descriptor read/64 error -110" and "device not accepting address" . I must unplug and replug the B200mini to get it work. I found a discussion thread which is similar to my situation:
[11:09:54] <cow225cow[m]> https://forums.ni.com/t5/USRP-Software-Radio/No-UHD-devices-found-after-reboot-Ubuntu-20-04/td-p/4157768?profile.language=zh-TW Does anyone have idea? 
[11:12:13] <tnt_> In that thread the usb device is always found an enumerated. Not the same issue.

[12:40:47] <drmpeg> That same thing happens with my B210. But only when I lose AC mains power (because I use a DC power supply on the B210).
[12:41:28] <drmpeg> I can't remember if it happens on all of my boxes.
[12:41:48] <tnt> The B210 is very power hungry. I know mine only works properly on the "charging" port of my laptop. Any other port and it will fail within seconds of starting the data stream and detach from the bus.
[12:42:59] <tnt> I'm guessing the power up sequence from sleep of the netbook might not have full power on USB or try to put it in usb low power mode or something like that and the wakeup is either not working or it simply crashes the fx3 or something like that.
[12:43:30] <tnt> But really, short of putting a usb protocol analyzer on the bus, I'm not sure how I'd figure it out.
[12:43:33] <drmpeg> I have the problem on a regular workstation.
[12:44:11] <tnt> Well, the B210 violates the usb power specs ... so a work station can shutdown the port if it wants to when detecting the overcurrent condition.
[12:44:51] <drmpeg> Yeah, maybe.
[12:45:13] <drmpeg> I haven't really tried to chase the problem down.
[12:45:34] <drmpeg> I rarely lose AC power here in Silicon Valley.
[12:46:01] <drmpeg> So it only happens once in a while.
[12:47:13] <tnt> I also have a cable where it fails even on the high power usb port ... probably too large voltage drop / too thin power conductor in it.

[18:03:01] <jholtom> drmpeg: tnt: it comes from when DC external power is plugged in, it pulls some line low and the normal firmware load over USB can't take place.  so its a firmware needs to be loaded before DC external power can be plugged in issue
[18:03:21] <jholtom> have experienced many variations of this problem including one where the computer itself won't boot when a B210 is plugged in on start up
[18:06:49] <drmpeg> Yes, I have to unplug the DC external power to get things unglued.
[18:08:32] <drmpeg> So it's 1) unplug DC external power. 2) unplug USB. 3) reboot computer. 4) plug in USB. 5) plug in DC external power.
[18:10:07] <drmpeg> But as I said before, it only happens when I lose AC mains and everything powers down.
[18:27:35] <jholtom> Oh that's even funkier
[18:27:44] <jholtom> I typically don't have to do steps 2 and 3
[18:28:44] <drmpeg> It's possible I don't have to either. That's just the OCD method. :)
[18:33:18] <drmpeg> I also have another box that doesn't have this issue. But it's an older B210 and a different USB 3.0 controller.
[18:38:49] <willcode4[m]> I found that the startup behavior of the B210 depends on cable seating, which USB port it's plugged into on a laptop, phase of moon, etc. Usually, I do steps 1, 2, 4, 5.

I have successfully created one that generates desired pulse width at a 50% duty cycle using the "signal source square wave" option. But, I want to a 10% duty cycle instead. How can I achieve this? Thanks in advance.
[22:44:42] <eph123[m]> * Hello! Friends, I am trying to create a Pulse Generator using grc. I have successfully created one that generates desired pulse width at a 50% duty cycle using the "signal source square wave" option. But, I want a 10% duty cycle instead. How can I achieve this? Thanks in advance.

[23:36:12] <supersat> drmpeg: what does the first number in dvbs2 samples like http://www.w6rz.net/cosmic16apsk_138_89.ts mean? I assume 89 is an 8/9 coding rate. 16 APSK makes sense too. Not sure where the 189 comes from or what it means

[23:52:42] <nkiz> JoshMorman[m], Thanks! That's pretty much exactly what I was looking for.
[23:53:31] <flash[m]> what happens in scheduling when forecast() is called with noutput_items=1 and it returns ninput_items_required[0]=1600 ?
[23:54:44] <DerekKozel[m]> Pretty sure the scheduler will either supply >= 1600 samples at the input, or wait until it is able to do so
