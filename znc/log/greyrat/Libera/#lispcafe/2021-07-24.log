[04:47:36] <hayley> Let's say they are making an IRC chat bot. At least the performance characteristics should be the same. Why are they being told to be careful with heap allocations for that of all things??

[04:51:40] -ixelp- Bunker Soldiers (2003 Digital Remaster) - YouTube
[04:52:35] <hayley> But, like, for the time it takes to heap allocate (not an awful lot), for the time between messages to parse (a lot), and given that no one has even profiled this shit, this is insane.

[05:01:32] <hayley> Or if really necessary, can't you use an arena allocator per message?
[05:37:52] <pjb> hayley: because a bot should be long-lived, so "memory leaks" would be a problem for them.  Processes that are short lived can leak all the memory they want.
[05:38:40] <hayley> pjb: Well, given it is Rust they _shouldn't_ leak would they heap allocate, and an arena allocator per message would have very short lived allocations.
[05:40:28] <pjb> ok

[06:11:07] <sm2n> something something premature optimization
[06:11:44] <hayley> Abso-fucking-lutely.
[06:22:43] <sm2n> so I've been thinking about it
[06:23:03] <sm2n> but isn't erlang's design kind of antiquated now?
[06:23:11] *** Joins: dave0 (~davezero@069.d.003.ncl.iprimus.net.au)
[06:23:38] <sm2n> afaik BEAM uses per actor heaps to minimize gc pause time, but stuff like ZGC seems to have similar performance characteristics
[06:23:56] <dave0> maw
[06:23:58] <sm2n> plus if you have a shared heap you can do zero copy message passing
[06:24:42] <sm2n> am I missing something? it seems to me that if you were designing an actor runtime now, it wouldn't be optimal to do per actor heaps
[06:24:42] <hayley> ZGC still has to do atomic operations, and IIRC it requires a read barrier (which isn't bad per se, but does impose some overhead on the mutator).
[06:25:50] <sm2n> is that a significant issue?
[06:26:01] <hayley> Whereas thread-local-everything means you have no synchronisation. Definitely a trade off with copying messages, but I think avoiding global synchronisation does help performance.
[06:27:23] <sm2n> hmm
[06:27:44] <sm2n> and it's not exactly easy to just build both and compare
[06:28:14] <hayley> If you really want that low latency with bump allocation, I guess it is workable. I ran Minecraft on a Pi with Shenandoah (ZGC would crash with SIGILL for some reason?) and it rocked still.
[06:28:48] <sm2n> plus copying all the time means your programs are designed for that, so switching to distributed actors is easier
[06:29:04] <sm2n> I see

[06:36:15] <hayley> IIRC they also wanted independent GCs so that the GC could be scheduled properly, and so that a GC bug would only take out a few actors rather than the whole node.
[06:49:23] <recordgroovy> My parser could be faster: https://0x0.st/-WzV.png
[06:49:59] <hayley> Time to whip out SB-SPROF?
[06:50:06] <recordgroovy> Time to whip out sb-sprof ;)
[06:52:07] <recordgroovy> But my code has some pain points on the functional side, so I'll fix that first before profiling
[06:53:21] <hayley> (Furthermore, thread local GC is "obviously" parallel and incremental. Of course ZGC is parallel and incremental too, but they need to be clever about it.)

[17:43:22] <hayley> .oO( Use SBCL? )
[17:43:38] <gilberth> Why?
[17:44:16] <hayley> Check if it compiles any better. Not saying it will, but we got multiple implementations for a reason. 
[17:44:37] <gilberth> It's slow because I have full run-time type checks on every assignment, RECORDs are plists with run-time checks that variants are not violated and + is a generic function.
[17:45:04] <hayley> You write out a Lisp file to compile, right? Why not DEFSTRUCT?
[17:45:10] <gilberth> It was not designed to be fast.
[17:45:38] <gilberth> hayley: Won't buy me much, only more hassle.
[17:46:25] <gilberth> And I write the SEXPR version of Pascal. The "compiler" is just macros.
[17:47:09] <hayley> beach edition: Use DEFCLASS and generate accessors?
[17:47:36] <gilberth> Yes, sure and how would you do that with anonymous records?
[17:48:27] <hayley> Hm.
[17:48:33] <gilberth> When I wanted to be fast, I'd just use vectors and be set. I could even displace (unsigned-byte 32) vectors to (unsigned-byte 8) vectors, if I wish.
[17:48:53] <hayley> Well, you have a structural type, intern a name for it and make a class with that name.

[17:52:06] <gilberth> TeX uses its own memory managment and has a union^Wvariant called memory-word. <http://clim.rocks/gilbert/tex/memory-word.lisp> This is also what goes into a format file. There is basically just one huge array called MEM of these guys.
[17:52:37] <gilberth> hayley: And write printers and such. Too much hassle.
[17:55:21] <gilberth> And serializers. As I need to write that to a format file.
[17:58:47] <gilberth> hayley: The "right" thing would be a meta class, which implements variants.
[18:01:43] <gilberth> However the nice thing about the compiler being just macros: I could interactively hack the sexpressionated Pascal. As: I intend to modify the macro processor to tell me each expansion.
[18:05:28] <gilberth> The problem is, that Knuth's WEB to Pascal translator also is a macro processor and thus a huge number of numeric constants pop up in the Pascal, with the original macro lost. Most macros could as well be Lisp macros, but not all, as this works on a textual level in nasty Knuth'sh manner.
[18:07:40] <gilberth> Like this trivial one: @d length(#)==(str_start[#+1]-str_start[#]) {the number of characters in string number \#} Cleaner would have been to have that as a function.
[18:07:55] <gilberth> This is a place: @d link(#) == mem[#].hh.rh {the |link| field of a memory word}
[18:10:35] <gilberth> Pretty messy. No pointers, data structures defined by that macros. And then this silly literate programming, which just is a bunch of pretty "unhygienic" macros. I mean macros happily referring to lexicals, so that the interface of those "subroutines" is not apparent.

[19:09:40] <selwyn> hayley: have you heard of the ´lindy effect´
[19:10:30] <hayley> I needed to jog my mind on it, but yes.
[19:10:47] <selwyn> roughly speaking, it is the idea that if you want to figure out which things are likely to be around in the far future
[19:10:58] <selwyn> they are overwhelmingly likely to be things that have already survived a long time
[19:11:24] <selwyn> e.g. if you want to figure out which books are likely to be read 50 years from now, look at those books which were already being read 50 years in the past
[19:11:34] <hayley> Right.
[19:11:45] <selwyn> while being on the new york times bestseller list at the moment is a very poor indicator of longevity
[19:12:10] <selwyn> software engineering is new enough that you would not think to employ such ideas, but i think that lisp is very lindy
[19:12:24] <shka> indeed

[19:16:03] <hayley> Though I guess 1970 is closer to three generations maybe?
[19:16:04] <shka> it was a cost effective solution and backward compatibility is important as it seems
[19:16:15] <selwyn> unix is still lindy
[19:16:20] <selwyn> lindy is not a moral judgement

[20:39:28] <gilberth> Pascal is funny, it defines the type INTEGER as -MAXINT..MAXINT, so a two's complement n bit word is not it.
[20:40:01] <shka> ok, my RF SOM seems to work
[20:40:25] <gilberth> Nice thing though is, that ABS of some integer cannot get you a runtime-error.
[20:40:39] <gilberth> shka: What's a SOM?
[20:40:53] <shka> self organizing map
[20:41:21] <gilberth> What kind of map?
[20:42:37] <shka> unsupervised machine learning used for dimensionality reduction and visualization 
[20:43:15] <gilberth> Ah, that is beyond me.
[20:43:28] <shka> grid of "units", units are "pulled" toward data to represent the training space 
[20:43:44] <shka> it is pretty "cool" algorithm
[20:44:16] <shka> somewhat inspired by biological neural networks
[20:44:26] <shka> i like to imagine that this is how insects see
[20:44:48] <shka> but it is probably not true :/
[20:45:05] <gilberth> Heh.
[20:45:22] <shka> anyway, when combined with the random forest, you can use SOM to visualize decision space of the random forest
[20:45:24] <gilberth> Well, machine learning is a topic I always evaded.
[20:45:39] <shka> or just embed it
[20:46:12] <shka> i like machine learning
[20:46:22] <shka> i wish i would do more of it in work
[20:46:31] <shka> because right now all i do is to process data
[20:46:50] <shka> for people who 50% of time have no idea what to do with ti

[20:50:33] <shka> i mean, RF SOM
[20:51:03] <gilberth> I need books!
[20:51:17] <shka> what kind of books?
[20:52:07] <gilberth> Books that teach me something. Weather is nice outside, yet I have no books to read.
[20:52:31] <gilberth> I miss the GC handbook, I have at the former home.
[20:52:53] <gilberth> Then I'd like to learn some quantum physics.
[20:53:08] <shka> i am afraid that i am in no position to recommend anything
[20:53:22] <shka> you are a knowledgeable already 
[20:53:58] <gilberth> Yeah, a pity, I am at a loss.
[20:54:45] <shka> though i've read "on intelligence" recently and it was fun
[20:54:59] <gilberth> Perhaps I find a textbook. Still, the GC handbook is high on my reading list, and expensive, so I won't just get a second copy.
[20:54:59] <shka> but you are not interested in machine learning i guess
[20:55:34] <gilberth> shka: That book you mention is terrific! I read that a while ago.
[20:55:47] <shka> oh, cool
[20:56:18] <gilberth> ML would be something, I could well learn, as I have the feeling that I miss something.
[20:57:40] <gilberth> shka: I liked the introduction where the author tells us how small and thin the conscious part of the brain really is.
[20:57:51] <shka> yeah
[20:58:29] * gilberth really misses his library.
[21:02:37] <selwyn> gilberth: do you know any quantum physics yet
[21:04:09] <gilberth> selwyn: Only what I gathered from some documentaries.
[21:04:15] <selwyn> hm
[21:04:38] <selwyn> i could recommend some resources if you are interested
[21:04:55] <gilberth> That would be just great!
[21:05:19] <selwyn> happy to help
[21:06:07] <gilberth> Would I need my calculus textbooks? I rarely need calculus, so it's all a bit blurry, though I have a firm understanding of the fundamentals.
[21:07:15] <selwyn> so
[21:07:25] <selwyn> there are some pedagogical treatments which tend to avoid calculus
[21:08:59] <selwyn> a) quantum mechanics: the theoretical minimum by susskind is one such book
[21:09:28] <selwyn> b) q is for quantum is similar i think, one of our professors wrote it
[21:10:47] <selwyn> c) these are close to my heart since i learned from them https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/eugene.lim/teach/QM2012/allchapters.pdf
[21:11:47] <selwyn> you will need some grounding in calculus and mathematical methods to get through them, but you will really know your stuff by the end of it
[21:13:01] <gilberth> It's just that I don't remember all those need-to-just-memorize things of calculus. That is everything Maxima would tell me :-)
[21:15:01] <gilberth> selwyn: Many thanks! /me updates his Amazon wishlist.
[21:15:19] <selwyn> the calculus arises usually if you want to solve schrodingers equation, which is a partial differential equation
[21:15:32] <selwyn> hence the need for ´mathematical methods´ not sure if that is a standard name for it
[21:16:17] <selwyn> you can learn quantum mechanics without having to solve schrodingers equation, but you would miss out on practical examples without having done that
[21:17:22] <selwyn> i.e. you can determine the energy gap between ground and excited states of a hydrogen atom, to a very good approximation
[21:17:32] <selwyn> which is something you can infer from spectral lines for example
[21:17:37] <selwyn> and this is a nice thing to see
[21:18:32] <gilberth> ok. I'll manage. I mean I once learned calculus pretty throughly.
[21:19:00] <selwyn> i think you will be fine and enjoy it
[21:19:08] * gilberth misses hardcover copies being offered.
[21:19:09] <selwyn> it really is linear algebra a lot of the time
[21:19:25] <gilberth> Algebra is fine!
[21:19:34] <selwyn> i got into quantum physics because i like linear algebra, not the other way round
[21:19:59] <gilberth> Heh. We're a good match then :)
[21:21:09] <gilberth> I was pretty good at algebra in general, not just linear. I sucked at calculus as I was too lazy to memorize all the calculation tricks. In fact the calculus test at the uni is the one single test, I ever failed.
[21:22:29] <gilberth> Oops, I find two copies of "Q is for quantum" one by Terry Rudolph and one by John Gribbin. Hmm.
[21:22:40] <selwyn> i think there is a broad cultural divide between the anglo world (more calculus) and europe (more algebra)
[21:22:44] <selwyn> terry rudolph
[21:23:16] <selwyn> a big part of my last year of high school was doing hard integration problems
[21:23:19] <gilberth> On my wish-list.
[21:25:15] <selwyn> i too have only ever failed one test
[21:26:22] <gilberth> After I failed that test, I attended every single damn lecture for a year. Early in the morning, before one would get up. Second time, I got a fair grade.
[21:26:29] <gilberth> selwyn: Which one was it?
[21:27:04] <selwyn> it was an entrance exam for a grammar school, which is a type of academically selective school
[21:27:10] <selwyn> sometime between 11-13yo
[21:27:34] <gilberth> Oh! What happened then?
[21:27:48] <selwyn> it was one of those non verbal reasoning tests
[21:28:12] <gilberth> non-verbal?
[21:28:21] <selwyn> uh
[21:28:28] <selwyn> it is sort of like questions you get on an iq test
[21:28:42] <selwyn> ´which figure comes next in the sequence´
[21:29:30] <selwyn> i didn´t realise the answer sheet was double sided, so i didn´t do half of the questions
[21:30:01] <selwyn> lol
[21:32:04] <gilberth> Heh! Like <https://i0.wp.com/blog.fenwickfriars.com/wp-content/uploads/FarSide_PushPull_1986.jpg?w=400&ssl=1>

[21:32:30] <selwyn> hahaha
[21:32:34] <selwyn> yeah i fucked up
[21:33:06] <selwyn> i also get push pull doors wrong sometimes
[21:33:45] <gilberth> I mix up left and right at times. Or east and west.
[21:33:58] <selwyn> i don´t think i would have enjoyed that school anyway, they were kind of arrogant
[21:34:28] <gilberth> Oh, that kind of school. Wouldn't be the right place for me, too.
[21:34:53] <selwyn> grammar schools have a reputation of providing egalitarian education to working class people
[21:35:23] <selwyn> which they do to an extent, but i have met a lot of people from them who were awful snobs
[21:35:34] <selwyn> sometimes more so than privately educated ones
[21:36:39] <selwyn> the ethos is not really egalitarian either - the concept is that if you are smart enough, you can qualify for a similar education to what privately educated pupils get
[21:36:40] <gilberth> Hmm, and then I always use the term grammar school, for the type of school here, you attend before hitting the university.
[21:36:50] <selwyn> yes it means something different in german doesn´t it
[21:36:54] <shka> i find interesting that "grammar" school was using "non-verbal reasoning" test :P
[21:36:59] <selwyn> shka: lol
[21:37:23] <gilberth> Well, in German it's "Gymnasium".
[21:38:20] <shka> in Poland it used to be gymnasium but we have rolled back to the longer elementary school recently
[21:38:50] *** Joins: ming (~ming@2601:547:a00:7720::88e8)
[21:38:52] <shka> but this was not enough, so we are going to rollback even further, to the medieval times
[21:39:04] <gilberth> Gymnasium used to be grade 5 to 13, now it's til grade 12.
[21:39:19] <selwyn> the top polish scientific high schools are really good imo
[21:39:28] <selwyn> though it may have changed in the last 10 years
[21:39:30] <shka> uh, perhaps
[21:39:50] <shka> problem is, that i am not all that concerned with the elite part of education
[21:39:54] <selwyn> fair enough
[21:40:17] <shka> i am a little marxist at heart, i want solid baseline
[21:40:34] <gilberth> Well, here there is an inflation in people getting "Abitur" which would qualify for study at the university. Grades given now are one whole grade better than they used to be.
[21:40:47] <shka> while the current gov tries to turn schools into indoctrination tool
[21:41:12] <selwyn> longer elementary school doesn´t sound good at all really, are they trying to put off critical thinking
[21:41:33] <gilberth> shka: What does your government not want to turn into indoctrination?
[21:41:55] <gilberth> School never was for critical thinking.
[21:42:13] <shka> selwyn: longer elementary school is not actually directly connected to the recent education program changes
[21:43:03] <selwyn> i see
[21:43:14] <shka> but rolling back successful reform was kinda stupid imho 
[21:43:38] <selwyn> i too want a solid baseline, but this is extremely difficult to achieve on normal island for lots of reasons

[21:44:50] <selwyn> my first real contact with polish people was with these graduates of elite high schools, so for some time i assumed the education system was really great
[21:44:55] <selwyn> but they tell me it is not really like that
[21:45:00] <shka> and this is just the cherry on top
[21:46:08] <selwyn> perhaps this is a dumb question, but are there catholic schools in poland
[21:46:14] <selwyn> and are they outside the curriculum
[21:46:14] <shka> a few
[21:46:25] <shka> but not as many as you would think
[21:47:05] <selwyn> right
[21:48:17] <shka> overall, it is really, really, really bad
[21:48:38] <shka> at least i don't have kids myself
