[09:11:05] <sunyibo> I can't reach https://gitlab.gnugen.ch/ 
[11:54:21] <LaurentRoro[t][m> rainbowdash is down !
[11:54:32] <LucasCrijns[m]> Me neither
[11:54:37] <LucasCrijns[m]> Matrix was also down yesterday
[11:54:41] <afontain[m]> Fixed
[12:12:33] <LucasCrijns[m]> Thank you!
[12:56:20] <afontain[m]> will still have to do something for rainbowdash and laurent.sexy
[13:09:16] <Orbstheorem> <Orbstheorem> "My ssh agent is set to request..." <- Is there anybody else interested in this?
[13:11:07] * afontain[m] doesn't have a fingerprint scanner
[13:11:55] <jonas[m]> well, my hardware key requires a physical key-press... 
[13:11:55] <jonas[m]> also fingerprint scanners which work on linux are quite rare, aren't they?
[13:13:01] <Orbstheorem> > my hardware key requires a physical key-press... 
[13:13:01] <Orbstheorem> Yes, but not necessarily from your finger :D
[13:13:17] <Orbstheorem> > fingerprint scanners which work on linux are quite rare, aren't they?
[13:13:17] <Orbstheorem> The ones on my laptops, they are all supported.

[13:14:12] <jonas[m]> > 
[13:14:12] <jonas[m]> > Yes, but not necessarily from your finger :D
[13:14:12] <jonas[m]> no, but malware can't do this and I unplug and take the key with me if I walk away from my computer...
[13:15:20] <Orbstheorem> > malware can't do this
[13:15:20] <Orbstheorem> Yes it can :D It can 'simply'  open /dev/input I think.
[13:15:58] <Orbstheorem> Or `wtype`.
[13:16:07] <Orbstheorem> Or `xdotool`.
[13:16:55] <Orbstheorem> But yeah, having a hardware security token is better.
[13:17:13] <jonas[m]> no, it can't press the button on the security key... and the security key will refuse any operation (signing, decrypting, authorizing) as long as nobody presses the button 
[13:17:59] <Orbstheorem> Yes, you're right, I forgot that most security tokens have their own 'confirm' button.
[13:20:46] <afontain[m]> I think I'll get one of those keys one day
[13:28:44] <Orbstheorem> I have one, but no security model to use it with.
[13:29:50] <Orbstheorem> It would be 'nice' to have my PGP key on it, but it would mean replacing my current key (since it serves little purpose to import one that may have been already compromised).

[17:46:13] <Notkea> oof, c'est mÃªme centrÃ©
[18:36:02] <afontain[m]> wow, ukrainian aparently got as far as launching missile strikes on oil reservoirs on russian soil https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-60953243
[18:36:10] <afontain[m]> the madmen
[18:36:27] <afontain[m]> with helicopters
[19:06:05] <afontain[m]> or this one, civilian cars passing between mines https://twitt.re/Liveuamap/status/1509253049440739332#m
[19:18:10] <LaurentRoro[t][m> c'est une blague ?
[19:28:25] <afontain[m]> je ne pense pas
[19:29:00] <afontain[m]> sinon les suÃ©dois disent que des avions de chasse russes sont passÃ©s sur leur espace aÃ©rien avec des armes nuclÃ©aires https://www.tv4.se/artikel/6cNV5sPAaxdIgAsnItdVsK/kaernvapenbestyckade-ryska-plan-kraenkte-svenskt-luftrum?msclkid=bbcecaecb1cb11eca00274a055efedbe
[19:29:52] <afontain[m]> rassurant tout Ã§a
[19:31:21] <artectrex[m]> <afontain[m]> "wow, ukrainian aparently got..." <- not clear it's actually ukrainians, it might not be
[19:31:31] <afontain[m]> that's true
[19:31:38] <afontain[m]> the russian claim it was ukrainian
[19:31:40] <afontain[m]> s/ukrainian/ukrainians/
[19:31:59] <afontain[m]> but it might be russian helicopters with a broken GPS?
[19:32:12] <artectrex[m]> afontain[m]: no, false flag
[19:32:25] <afontain[m]> that too
[19:32:27] <artectrex[m]> for this: https://twitter.com/AFP/status/1509824742265700392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1509833243457204230%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redditmedia.com%2Fmediaembed%2Fliveupdate%2F18hnzysb1elcs%2FLiveUpdate_864b36b0-b1ca-11ec-b51a-f2d763c80c46%2F0
[19:32:32] <afontain[m]> but that would be some really annoying false flag
[19:32:37] <artectrex[m]>  * for this: https://twitter.com/AFP/status/1509824742265700392
[19:33:52] <artectrex[m]> Anyway, let's not talk about too many war specifics here, I get enough of that already ðŸ˜…
[19:33:55] <Orbstheorem> <afontain[m]> "or this one, civilian cars..." <- How both lucky and cursed must you be to have something so important worth risking your life to cross over that damn highway...
[19:34:46] <artectrex[m]>  * for this: https://twitter.com/AFP/status/1509833243457204230
[19:36:06] <afontain[m]> also the article says "Exactly how the Russian aircraft were armed is not something we will comment upon right now. I would like to emphasise that if we had seen an increased threat directed against Sweden we would have informed the public about that"
[19:36:26] <afontain[m]> â€” the sweden air forces
[19:47:17] <LaurentRoro[t][m> en fait c'est ni ukrainien, ni russe, mais amÃ©ricain Ã  chaque fois XD

[21:08:39] <artectrex[m]> but sadly can't
[21:09:46] <jonas[m]> same for me ðŸ˜¬
[21:09:46] <jonas[m]> also midterms and submissions due the next two weeks
[21:16:16] <typedef[m]> Same here, having time is a bit of a commodity
[21:36:04] <Orbstheorem> Ugh
[21:36:10] <Orbstheorem> Same, but for my sanity, I need to do something 'useful'.
