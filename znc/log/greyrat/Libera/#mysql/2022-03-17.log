[09:25:40] <Isotopp> XenophonF: the approach you suggest, stop both servers, and tar the datadir would work, but is unacceptable for many people because of the downtime. otherwise it is fine
[09:26:02] <Isotopp> XenophonF: what thumbs suggests, xtrabackup, can do it at wire speed without downtime
[09:26:22] <Isotopp> XenophonF: for oracle mysql 8, and identical server versions, there is the new CLONE command that can also do it without downtime
[09:26:56] <Isotopp> XenophonF: your mysqldump approach creates a logical backup, the data is exported as sql and read in as sql in the destination. this is slow on restore because all indexes have to be recreated.
[09:27:20] <Isotopp> this involves incremental index building, which takes a lot of cpu and memory.
[09:28:50] <Isotopp> XenophonF: a 7 gb database is nothing in terms of size. it should work reasonably quickly with mysqldump and sourcing the sql. how much memory has your machine? how large is the buffer pool?

[15:24:38] <Isotopp> chose any of these locations
[15:24:53] <Isotopp> i think you would find that this will be an error. 0 is false is off, tho
[15:25:13] <Isotopp> in config files, 0 for off, and units in buffer sizes in bytes.
[15:25:24] <Isotopp> in set statements, keywords such as off for 0 are parsed and understood
[15:26:01] <Isotopp> and for units you can use math (set global  innodb_buffer_pool_size  = 100 * 1024 * 1024 )

[15:27:55] <Isotopp> and for innodb, https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html
[15:29:17] <Isotopp> the documentation lists the command line variable name, the system variable name, if it is global or per session, if it can be used with SET_VAR hints in individual queries, and if it is requires a server restart
[15:29:57] <Isotopp> while most variables have identical names for command line and system variable, this is not enforced and the mechanism allows deviation. there are few variables that actually do not follow the pattern

[15:41:32] <Isotopp> the problem is that it may be too large for the systems memory and when it actually gets used, the machines goes into swap

[15:42:05] <ph88> yes or possible to downgrade server configuration to save money

[15:44:17] <ph88> Isotopp, you mean VSZ column ?
[15:44:17] <Isotopp> res is committed  (actually used) memory, it is low in the beginnning and as the server warms up, eventually vsize and res are close.
[15:44:21] <Isotopp> yes

[15:59:38] <Isotopp> https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-dedicated-server.html
[16:00:01] <Isotopp> In general, the amount of innodb_buffer_pool_size determines the total server size, as that is by far the largest buffer
[16:00:43] <Naktibalda> per connection buffers can be signifficant too, if you have many connections, right?
[16:01:06] <Isotopp> yes, but see link above
[16:01:45] <ph88> so i had the default value of  innodb_buffer_pool_size  set to 128 MB .. how come virtual memory is  2147 MB ?
[16:02:22] <Isotopp> what is your max_connection value?
[16:02:23] <Naktibalda> https://www.mysqlcalculator.com/
[16:02:28] <ph88> unfortunately i  don't see  innodb_dedicated_server  on mariadb
[16:02:46] <Isotopp> mariadb does things differently I presume, but I cannot help you with that

[16:05:00] <ph88> thanks
[16:05:17] <Isotopp> max heap table size, tmp table size -- all that stuff does no longer work this way in oracle mysql 8, but mariadb may be more traditional here. i have no idea how they solved the tmp file problem
[16:06:10] <ph88> made note
[16:07:43] <ph88> how can i know if innodb_buffer_pool_size is too small ?
[16:07:57] <Isotopp> that is a research question :-)
[16:08:29] <Isotopp> so obviously when buffer_pool > du -s /var/lib/mysql/*, it is large enough to buffer everything
[16:08:58] <Isotopp> also obviously, when the database grows larger than all availabble data, it has to work as a cache.
[16:09:26] <Isotopp> it has a LRU with midpoint insertion, and that can be configured a bit. The LRU makes it cache heavily used pages for sure,
[16:09:40] <Isotopp> and the midpoint insertion prevents scans from flushing needed pages
[16:10:35] <Isotopp> The server has https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-status-variables.html#statvar_Innodb_buffer_pool_read_requests
[16:10:43] <Isotopp> and https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-status-variables.html#statvar_Innodb_buffer_pool_reads
[16:11:04] <Isotopp> as long as the ratio between requests and actual reads is good 998/1000 or soemthing, the cache is fine
[16:11:29] <Isotopp> also, if you can increase server load without actual disk reads going up, the load and the disk load are decoupled, so the cache is effective.
[16:11:41] <Isotopp> that tells us, if the cache is still useful.
[16:11:45] <ph88> SELECT SUM(data_length+index_length) Total_InnoDB_Bytes FROM information_schema.tables WHERE engine='InnoDB';
[16:11:49] <Isotopp> it does not construct a number to set of the cache

[16:12:38] <Isotopp> 7 mb is a joke, default config wiill run that
[16:12:54] <Isotopp> on a cell phone
[16:12:59] <ph88> how to make it non-joke ?
[16:13:11] <Isotopp> add data
[16:13:12] <Isotopp> :-)
[16:13:42] <XenophonF> thanks a lot, Isotopp! what you said about reindexing makes perfect sense and explains what I was seeing in top. myloader took about two hours to import the database. I'll take a look at xtrabackup today. I think our database servers are really short on memory and CPU allocations, so I'll see about increase them. Thanks again!
[16:14:22] <Isotopp> XenophonF: read the backlog and what i just wrote to ph88 about disk read requests and disk reads. the same logic applies
[16:14:28] <ph88> du -s  is in bytes ?
[16:14:38] <Isotopp> i think 512 byte blocks, use -k
[16:14:43] <Isotopp> for kilobytes
[16:15:38] <mickey> how would you count how many distinct values are there in column A, grouped by column B?
[16:15:49] <Isotopp> ph88: [root:/var/lib/mysql] # du -k --total */*.ibd
[16:15:56] <Isotopp> ... 12312   total
[16:16:06] <mickey> like, i'm expecting a number for each value of column B, indicating how many distinct values there are in column A
[16:16:19] <ph88> Isotopp,  du: cannot access '*/*.ibd': No such file or directory
[16:16:19] <ph88> 0       total
[16:16:31] <ph88> oh sorry, not in right dir
[16:16:38] <Isotopp> ph88: yes, as a random user you cannot bypass the database server
[16:16:51] <Isotopp> oh, and that is of course in datadir

[16:17:20] <Isotopp> mickey: select b, a, count(*) as cnt from t group by b, a with rollup ?
[16:17:22] <ph88> is that in kilobytes then ?
[16:17:24] <Isotopp> does that do what you want?
[16:17:32] <Isotopp> ph88: yes, assuming linux and gnu tools
[16:18:26] <ph88> Isotopp, > also obviously, when the database grows larger than all availabble data, it has to work as a cache.    -----  don't understand this sentence
[16:18:43] <Isotopp> ph88: it = the buffer pool
[16:20:43] <ph88> Isotopp, what is the difference between looking for ibd files and just count together all the stuff that is in that folder ?

[16:24:41] <Isotopp> innodb stores data in ibd files.
[16:24:48] <Isotopp> the other files are  other unrelated stuff
[16:25:04] <Isotopp> this is only an estimate anyway
[16:25:10] <ph88> ok

[22:52:28] <bytestream> is alter table drop constraint implemented in mysql 8, and not prior versions?
[22:54:05] <bytestream> my assumption is yes, given it works in mysql 8 and not mysql 5.7, but can't find any docs on it
[22:55:11] <Xgc> bytestream: "As of MySQL 8.0.19, ALTER TABLE permits more general (and SQL standard) syntax for dropping and altering existing constraints of any type, where the constraint type is determined from the constraint name"
