[00:00:53] <sney> zumba_addict: any time a package wants to change global configuration during upgrade, it'll give you a prompt asking to confirm. it won't delete users, other things may change, just pay attention to what dpkg asks you during the process :)

[03:25:26] <meandrain> https://dpaste.org/0VeY
[03:25:56] <pert> meandrain: probably because you have the 5.14 kernel backport installed, but it's *not* the backports linux-image-amd64 metapackage pulling it in. you might've installed it manually?
[03:26:20] <meandrain> I don't know, I am new to debian

[03:27:23] <pert> that's pretty strange. did you follow some troubleshooting instructions somewhere that told you to upgrade your Linux kernel?
[03:27:29] <pert> it's not a problem in and of itself, you're okay
[03:27:56] <meandrain> the debian machine on amd ryzen keept freezing, so I did the upgrade to see if the issue is fixed
[03:28:27] <meandrain> I might've followed some troubleshooting instructions somewhere
[03:28:59] <meandrain> (the machine is still freezing after 2-3 days)
[03:29:24] <pert> oh, okay. do you remember how you installed it from backports in the first place? does the command "apt install -t bullseye-backports linux-image-amd64" look familiar, especially the "-t bullseye-backports" look familiar? If so, you should run that command; that will get you the backport version of linux-image-amd64, so your Linux packages can live in harmony

[03:31:19] <pert> spoopy, backports almost always have to be manually enabled - they're not enabled by default for a variety of reasons. well fortunately it's nothing to worry about. I hope you get your freezing issue figured out, is it pretty new hardware?
[03:31:50] <meandrain> it is a: AMD Ryzen 9 3900 12-Core Processor  machine
[03:32:40] <meandrain> I don't have physical access to the machine

[09:52:38] <sney> check here if it's being tracked by the security team, and if not, file a bug. #debian does not handle security issues directly
[09:53:14] <System_Error> can dpkg lookup state of CVE?

[09:56:02] <sney> oh there it is, I wonder why I couldn't find it directly https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-44847
[09:56:52] <sney> the linked bug report 1001711 says what's being done about it
[09:58:35] <System_Error> That's better but can someone ping maintainers or secteam? I've sent mail to maintainer, but its better to ping 'em more.
[09:58:50] <System_Error> Having THIS kind of thing FOR A MONTH just uh-oh.
[10:01:00] <sney> you can email the security team, though the tracker of doom already says it is considered a minor issue for buster/bullseye, thus you might not get a reply.
[10:01:40] <System_Error> Remotely explotiable over net? Minor issue? Whoa.
[10:01:45] <sney> the maintainer might upload a fix for 11.3 but the bug report thread doesn't say what they've decided
[10:01:59] <sney> again, since it probably got buried - #debian does not handle security issues directly
[10:02:27] <sney> we can help you navigate all of the different debian sites and resources, but your best bet for doing something about this is to contact teams and maintainers directly, yourself
[10:03:18] <sney> at a guess, it's probably considered minor due to low popcon score, https://qa.debian.org/popcon.php?package=libtoxcore

[10:07:44] <System_Error> And looking how this handled maybe its my time to consider some more secure distro :\
[10:07:55] <sney> something that can help updates get pushed is if an affected user submits a patch for the affected stable package, so if you have a working update for 0.2.12-1 then you should attach it to that bug thread
[10:08:13] <System_Error> That's just sub-par CVE handling any day :(
[10:08:34] <sney> the debian archive is huge, the package maintainers do not have unlimited time, triage and prioritization must be done even if individual package users don't think this is acceptable
[10:09:47] <sney> and if a different distro suits your needs better, then go use it. these are just tools, loyalty outside of utility would be silly
[10:10:57] <System_Error> You make a lot of sense. As for loyalty its convenient, nice, but... I've never thought it suxx at security THAT much.
[10:11:39] <System_Error> Just decided to check CVE on thing I've had some fun with and ... whoops.
[10:12:29] <sney> it really varies, if a big package like the kernel or ssl etc has a major flaw, lots of people come together to fix it
[10:13:03] <sney> it all comes down to human effort and time, which is limited, so

[11:13:38] <System_Error> IMO, if maintainers unable to maintain package, they'd better drop it and/or resign, uploading outright vulnerable SW to users just irresponsible.
[11:15:43] <Heston> same issue with the chromium package
[11:17:42] <jelly> System_Error, it's not about being "unable".  That line specifically means someone _took a look_ and decided it was not important enough to fix
[11:17:56] <System_Error> Chromium is big piece of smouldering wreck. But this thing only needs TWO BRACKETS AROUND MACRO added in rather small lib.
[11:18:28] <System_Error> and decided it was not important enough to fix <- And IMO they were sorta incompetent. To say the least.
[11:18:48] <jelly> that usually means it's not exploitable by default; I have no idea about the particular case
[11:21:19] <System_Error> It _is_ exploitable. Remotely. Over net. Without user actions. There's workaround - but it isn't default. It is unknown if this escalates to code exec, but at least it going to crash.
[11:23:07] <System_Error> Damn, I wonder when debian security processes became so ruined. I had impression it worked better than that.

For unauthenticated download, HTTP: http://daniel.haxx.se/docs/ftp-vs-http.html . Debian ceased offering mirrors via FTP on 2017-11-01 https://www.debian.org/News/2017/20170425
[16:15:19] <randall> rockworld: ^
[16:15:34] <rockworld> dpkg, buster->bullseye
[16:15:34] <dpkg> Read (at least) the upgrading chapter of <release notes> https://deb.li/39cyD . TL;DR: In /etc/apt/sources.list change "buster" to "bullseye", fix the line for security updates (see <bullseye-security>), remove stable-specific lines like buster-backports. apt update && apt upgrade --no-new-pkgs && apt full-upgrade. 3rd party repos like <dmo> cause problems with upgrades. If working over ssh, upgrade ssh first, see <bullseye ssh upgrade>.
[16:15:35] <randall> rockworld: Tell us about your use case and we'll suggest far better options.

[16:19:00] <randall> !sftp
[16:19:00] <dpkg> sftp is a program that provides FTP-like functionality over an ssh2 tunnel and is usually what you should be using instead of ftp://ftp.  Linux clients are in the packages openssh-client, filezilla, gftp and many file managers like dolphin, konqueror and nautilus.  The server is in the package openssh-server.  For Windows clients, ask me about <winscp>, <filezilla>.  See also <scp> and <sshfs>.

[21:50:56] <Azrael_-> i want to understand an installerscript which installs resolvconf but then the local dns resolving totally fails as resolv.conf is then empty without any entries beside comments. how do you normally set it up with resolvconf?
[21:52:11] <Khepra> Azrael_-: you normally don't, that's an old technology, not really useful today.
[21:54:14] <Khepra> resolv.conf is set either statically or you allow dhcp to define it; by default dhclient does so, doesn't use resolvconf. On the other side, NM also defines resolv.conf, and these days systemd-resolved does as well.  resolvconf really lost raison d'etre

[22:11:06] <EEE> I'm currently using Debian 11 and don't think a single one of my packages got updated in over a month. Is that to be expected? I feel like I was getting at least weekly update previously. Not complaining, just want to make sure I didn't mis-configure my apt pinning or apt sources

[22:12:04] <Khepra> Hawker: depends which packages you have installed
[22:12:12] <sney> debian stable releases are intended to be stable, so not getting a lot of updates is normal depending on what you have installed
[22:12:13] <sney> !bullseye sources.list
[22:12:13] <dpkg> A suitable /etc/apt/sources.list for "Bullseye" has three lines: "deb https://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye main" "deb https://deb.debian.org/debian-security bullseye-security main" "deb https://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye-updates main". See <deb-src> <contrib> <non-free> <bullseye-updates> and `man sources.list`.
[22:12:26] <sney> make sure your sources.list matches this ^ and you're fine
[22:12:34] <Khepra> that's not what stable in Debian Stable means.

[22:13:01] <Hawker> thx I'll double check then. I just wanted to make sure!
[22:13:13] <sney> though if there's a specific update you think you're missing, specify it and we can help you figure that out.
[22:14:56] <Khepra> I've seen a bunch of updates in bullseye, latest was firefox-esr few days ago. Buster, on the other hand, I haven't seen in months.
[22:14:58] <Hawker> nah nothing in particular, it's just that I'd have expected something at all... then again, I'm running all stable packages and most are not very actively developed
[22:15:21] <Hawker> Khepra, yeah I didn't get any firefox updates in over a month
[22:15:36] <Hawker> So I'll just double check my apt sources is good and get back to you guys! :D
