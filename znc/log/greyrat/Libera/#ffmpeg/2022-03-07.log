[02:31:52] <sentriz> hi all, could anyone help with an issue I have with passing audio data to decode with stdin? based on `invalid concatenated file detected - using bitrate for duration`
[02:32:10] <sentriz> here is a demo of what I'm having an issue with https://termbin.com/meyg
[02:33:18] <sentriz> oops, I meant this one https://termbin.com/7anu
[02:40:12] <BtbN> in a lot of cases, formats require ffmpeg to seek around. You make that impossible if you supply the file via pipe. Which limits features or breaks the process entirely.
[02:41:51] <sentriz> BtbN: gotcha thanks. I'll just use a file then

With H265 in front of every I frame slice extra copies of the VPS, SPS and PPS nal units are added. This breaks sliced video as it adds them between slices of the same frame.

[14:57:19] <Obsdark> maybie in general terms, as of what would be require in the command
[14:58:23] <Obsdark> there is a lot of options and i'm not as profficient in ffmpeg at all, can somebody guide to a generic guide where they explain what part is for what and how connect with all the rest?
[14:58:35] <Obsdark> or maybie a written guide?
[14:59:07] <Obsdark> would like to have a better understanding of the process of streaming in order to being able to use ffmpeg properly

[15:20:24] <clock> hi all
[15:22:26] <Kadigan> I assume "yuv4444p10le" got changed to "yuva444p10le" at some point?
[15:23:31] <JEEB> four fours makes no sense so I'd be surprised if that was the case
[15:24:06] <Kadigan> I know this worked at some point, because I recently upgraded (rebuilt) ffmpeg and now it refused to work.
[15:24:24] <JEEB> checking the git history with "changing lines matching" there is no "yuv4444p10le"
[15:24:36] <JEEB> as in, no commit has at any point changed a line containing that string
[15:24:51] *** Joins: Buster_ (~Buster@46.160.36.66)
[15:25:13] <Kadigan> Okay, then I'm very surprised.
[15:25:13] <JEEB> ditto for commit message contents
[15:25:24] <Kadigan> Not sure how that ever worked, then.
[15:25:54] <Kadigan> Hmmm... Possible that I had that as an error, changed it locally, but never updated the master script.
[15:26:56] <Kadigan> Thanks for checking it out for me JEEB, appreciate it.
[15:27:43] <JEEB> three fours would of course be the non-alpha containing variant of the latter, which is a possibility. but if you specifically had four 4s then I'd say that never worked
[15:28:22] <Kadigan> Yeah, it looks that way.
[15:28:24] <clock> How can I make ffplay play 1600x900 60fps raw video from pipe on Raspberry Pi 4B? I have a process that generates 2.5 Gbps on stdout (verified with |pv >/dev/null) and 1600x900 60 fps requires only 2.07 Gbps, but ffplay maxes out at 1280x720 (1.3 Gbps) without framedropping.
[15:28:47] <Kadigan> The only "counter" I have is a) my own script that had yuv4444p10le, and b) a github script that has the same for prores_ks profile 4.
[15:28:50] <clock> ./demo.elf | ffplay -f rawvideo -pixel_format rgb24 -video_size $w""x$h -framerate 60 -
[15:30:34] <Kadigan> Might be possible that it's a bastardisation of yuv444p10le which "for some reason didn't produce alpha" :D
[15:31:07] <clock> I looked into changing the output device, but 1) I don't see the output device printed by ffplay, 2) in the manpage ffplay I see only an option to list output devices, but not to set them. I also googled but found only irrelevant talk, no info how to set ffplay output device.
[15:32:19] <clock> interesting devices listed (E muxing supported): opengl fbdev sdl v4l2 vout_egl xv
