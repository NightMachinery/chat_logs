[00:06:32] <vinrock> fitness classes, aerobics, yoga, physical therapy, etc
[00:06:37] <fritzwastaken> Funny enough, I had gotten a year membership for me and the wife to a local gym for their new years special last year
[00:06:43] <fritzwastaken> we went about a dozen times, then covid hit
[00:06:49] <fritzwastaken> FUUUUUU
[00:07:16] <rpifan> ouch
[00:07:19] <vinrock> my boy that owns the gym bought a house with his new wife right before covid hit and all his trainers quit
[00:07:23] <rpifan> well i was in super good shape during covid
[00:07:23] <vinrock> and his wife got laid off from Fila
[00:07:24] <fritzwastaken> and rpifan, you are a different breed of very self conscious man
[00:07:27] <rpifan> no drinking just lifting at home
[00:07:33] <vinrock> so he had to run the place by himself for like a year and it was rough
[00:07:37] <fritzwastaken> Of course youve been 5 days this week on a friday

[02:37:36] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Ever wondered why it’s so difficult to swat a fly? Well, it’s pretty much down to their quick reaction times and their agility. House flies are able to process what they see and react accordingly at amazing speeds. To put things into perspective, our brains process around 60 images a second, whereas a fly can process around 250 in a single second.

House flies are able to process what they see and react accordingly at amazing speeds. To put things into perspective, our brains process around 60 images a second, whereas a fly can process around 250 in a single second.

[06:03:07] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: House flies defecate… a lot! And they aren’t too worried about where they do it either! As you know, house flies like to live off a liquid diet. Because of this, their digestive system can move quite quickly, which means they defecate often. It is speculated that house flies defecate every time they land, even if it’s on their next meal!

[20:21:00] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> https://www.learndmarc.com/
[20:22:10] <catbeard> he said DKIM not DMARC
[20:22:40] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> so what?
[20:22:47] <catbeard> here u go `v=DKIM1 k=rsa; p=base64_here;`
[20:23:26] <catbeard> 1 DKIM, that will be 5 internet dollars or 0.000000053 $SHIB
[20:26:10] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> 0.000000053 for DNS
[20:29:49] <voice06[m]> hopefully that update borked windows server is a vm

[20:31:54] <TurkeyGibby> !flyfact
[20:31:54] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: House flies live on a liquid diet! Yes, thats correct. Flies tend to live off a diet based on liquids. Why? Well, that’s just how they are built. See, they lack the mouthparts needed to chew food, so instead, they have to drink it.
[20:32:55] <catbeard> i know almost everything about spf/dkim/dmarc already, my work doesn't have to deal with the inbound side of things, just outbound DNS-wise.  I can fix up OpenDKIM on Postfix, work doesn't fucking touch it (but uses postfix though)
[20:33:46] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> wait so who does inbound?
[20:33:59] <catbeard> the client's email provider

[20:34:36] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> we deal with the inbound mail on our server but we relay to an external SMTP server for outbound mails
[20:34:56] <catbeard> yeah we enforce smarthost egress through outbound spam filter

[23:37:39] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> lmao
[23:37:45] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> wtf is this sed
[23:37:45] <fritzwastaken> oh nice
[23:37:58] <Haise0> LOL
[23:38:05] <Haise0> wtf did you manage to do
[23:38:08] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> no clue
[23:38:12] <ender> haha
[23:38:21] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> maybe i needed p.*?
[23:38:34] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> test string to put new stuff
[23:38:38] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> s/p.*/wew
[23:38:39] <layer8> HurdyGurdyBurdy meant: "test string to wew"
[23:38:45] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> okay so I did
[23:38:59] <fritzwastaken> I respect the research and development
[23:39:18] <Haise0> he might watch it for inspiration ;)
[23:39:27] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> unfortunately I'm not a regex wizard
[23:39:32] <fritzwastaken> i mean, hes old AF and single
[23:39:34] <Haise0> to do regex
[23:39:36] <fritzwastaken> so im assuming nooooot
[23:39:36] <Haise0> bring your cat
[23:39:40] <Haise0> and let her play on your keyboard
[23:40:06] <fritzwastaken> I mean, I could have my cat write shakespeare if I put treats on the right buttons
[23:40:14] <Haise0> true true 
[23:40:15] <fritzwastaken> fucking food whoore
[23:40:25] <Haise0> any animal is a food whore
[23:40:29] <Haise0> especially cats and dogs
[23:40:40] <fritzwastaken> This cat was 22 pounds when we got him. Hes down to 15
[23:40:45] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> the stronger the food drive the more trainable they are!
[23:40:50] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> even cats!
[23:40:55] <Haise0> fritzwastaken: domestic cat ?
[23:41:09] <fritzwastaken> This morning my wife made an omelette and he came to me, asleep as fuck and bugged me to get him some
[23:41:13] <fritzwastaken> yea
[23:41:16] <Haise0> ah
[23:41:26] <Haise0> if it was Ragdoll or Maine Coon, it would be a different story
[23:41:28] *** Joins: SpeakerToMeat (~Speaker@user/speakertomeat)
[23:41:30] <Haise0> those shits are huge
[23:41:34] <fritzwastaken> DAD! DAD! Mom made an omelette and I want some, can you go get me some?
[23:41:36] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> fuck I want a ragdoll so badly
[23:41:46] <Haise0> Ragdoll is dog in cat's body
[23:41:49] <Haise0> such a friendly and sweet cat
[23:41:50] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> exactly
[23:42:00] <fritzwastaken> hes a big ass black bombay
[23:42:01] <Haise0> and Maine Coon aren't behind either
[23:42:11] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> my friend had a maine coon
[23:42:19] <fritzwastaken> my other cat is 6 pounds, and sits in her bed and sleepos
[23:42:21] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> was also a giant slut for pets
[23:42:37] <Haise0> fritzwastaken: lol, typical cat stuff lol
[23:42:43] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> i need a project for learning haskell
[23:42:51] <Haise0> do something like Golang
[23:42:55] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> no!
[23:42:59] <Haise0> I do Golang, Python and C#
[23:43:03] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> i wanna try my hand at a functional
[23:43:05] <Haise0> and I might wanna learn C better
[23:43:11] <Haise0> though I learned basics of it 2 years ago
[23:43:23] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> reject C, learn Rust
[23:43:28] <Haise0> and 8 years ago I learned Qbasic64
[23:43:52] <Cl0udNinja> Haise0, you could help me figure out how the fuck to program this networking shit in C on an AVR :P
[23:43:58] * Cl0udNinja cries in C and bad documentation
[23:44:17] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> no, you must embrace C and the cancer that is 20+ y/o docs!
[23:44:19] <Cl0udNinja> also... sup nerds
[23:44:19] <Haise0> lol, I know basics of C, haven't explored networking shit yet
[23:44:25] <Haise0> sup Cl0udNinja
[23:44:42] <Haise0> HurdyGurdyBurdy: my plan is to expand C knowledge for some electrical engineering projects
[23:44:47] <Haise0> that involve microcontrollers 
[23:44:59] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> learn rust and make $$$
[23:45:03] <Haise0> meh
[23:45:04] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> it's basically C lel
[23:45:09] <Cl0udNinja> same. I actually didnt know C for shit when I got into this project, and everything was a 'breeze' until I got to the network chip
[23:45:27] <Haise0> C can be cruel in a lot of stuff 
[23:45:58] <Cl0udNinja> s/(cruel).*/\1/
[23:45:59] <layer8> Haise0 meant: "C can be cruel"
[23:46:17] <Cl0udNinja> wow layer8 actually does complex regex... nice
[23:46:21] <Haise0> lol
[23:46:28] <Haise0> HurdyGurdyBurdy: I'll explore Rust if I have need for it or feel like tinkering with it
[23:46:38] <Haise0> nothing against language but most stuff I find is still good old C
[23:46:48] <Cl0udNinja> rust was just approved for use in projects at work, but I've not looked at or tinkered with it
[23:46:58] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> it's syntax makes my head hurt
[23:47:03] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> so i said "fuck this"
[23:47:05] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> lel
[23:47:08] <Haise0> that is why I have Visual Studio lol
[23:47:15] <Haise0> full fat IDE holding my hand like a baby
[23:47:20] *** Quits: GrantN05 (GrantN05@user/grantn05) (Quit: Bye)
[23:47:33] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> even with an IDE it'll still hurt my head. Figuring out borrows is less than fun
[23:47:43] <Haise0> yea lol
[23:47:48] <Cl0udNinja> the only reason I use an IDE is for compiling and the side pane of files + file tabs
[23:48:04] <Haise0> I try to abuse it as much as I can
[23:48:06] <Cl0udNinja> I hate the suggestions and autocorrect shit with a passion
[23:48:09] <Haise0> to make my life easier 
[23:48:32] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> imo, you only really need vstudio or idea-based for C#, JAVA, and maybe C/C++
[23:48:57] <Cl0udNinja> dont forget nodejs :P
[23:49:08] <Cl0udNinja> well not visual studio, but an IDE in general
[23:49:10] <sd> 05<M​oowool> Or for platform-specific applications, like using Godot's IDE to code GDScript in the game engine
[23:49:27] <Haise0> I've done a bit of C, C# and Python is VS
[23:49:30] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> fuck nodejs
[23:49:32] <Haise0> its not bad at all
[23:49:35] *** Joins: GrantN05 (GrantN05@user/grantn05)
[23:49:39] <Haise0> HurdyGurdyBurdy: its fine for frontend
[23:49:48] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> fuck FE!
[23:49:51] <Cl0udNinja> I write my code in the terminal on nano/vim (vim only if nano unavailable) dont judge me
[23:50:01] <Haise0> each to their own
[23:50:04] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> i use vim and vscode for just about everything
[23:50:11] <Haise0> if you have comfortable of way of doing it
[23:50:15] <Haise0> then go ahead, nothing wrong with that
[23:50:56] <Cl0udNinja> if I have to compile/build a project, I'll use an ide because 1 button builds are nice, or if its got -a lot- of files, then I switch to an ide, but before that, give me a terminal lol
[23:51:15] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> yeah that is very comfy
[23:51:37] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> all that matters is that you aren't writing bug filled code and that it follows some kind of style guide
[23:51:52] <Cl0udNinja> yup
[23:52:26] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> which reminds me to get more used to making .editorconfig
[23:52:37] <yuken> TurkeyGibby, ok so, my bubblnig has gone from pretty constant, to 2 seconds last night, to 3 seconds today
[23:52:38] <yuken> bottle time?
[23:53:46] <Cl0udNinja> I've come to realize that packer isnt as great as I once thought it was... one of the things at work I've been workin on is making an imaging process for all of the cloud providers
[23:53:50] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> >3 seconds today
[23:53:52] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> explain
[23:54:26] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> if it's not nearly as active as it was during the main fermentation stage then you're probably good to bottle. You are doing bottle conditioning, right? 
[23:54:39] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> or are you co2 injecting
[23:54:45] <Cl0udNinja> the process for our imaging is kinda unique, in that we use a surrogate VM and attach a disk, do the imaging onto that disk, and export that disk as the image. (basically a chroot install in a sense)
[23:56:20] <Cl0udNinja> the builders that packer has dont cover this for the cloud providers, except aws. so I hacked a bunch of shit bash together to make our process work. decided to make it into a real project and started writing python/hcl to make my own packer-like system
