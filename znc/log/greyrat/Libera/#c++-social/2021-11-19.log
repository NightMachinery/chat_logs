[14:45:31] <Carbonflux> i always assumed a passport was a universal ID
[14:55:59] <Donno> My driver's licence has printed onto the back that it only authorised use of it for ID purposes is when used for policing roads. Yet, it is essentially required to get a passport, open bank accounts and purchase alcohol.
[14:58:10] <Carbonflux> its funny really, people complain that the state monitors people to much and can ID anyone, yet it can be hard to prove who you are. 
[15:02:34] <Donno> That might be somewhat similar to tax, they make you file tax forms (i.e you need to say how much you earned, etc), yet they can prove/'know' when you give them the wrong information.
[15:03:32] <Carbonflux> ya exactly
[15:04:50] <Donno> Of course in that case it might be more like resourcing, they have the ability to find out what it should be but they can't do that for everyone. As more things move digital that's going to be less and less likely.
[15:05:09] <Carbonflux> it seems like a kind of compliance ritual.
[15:05:48] <Carbonflux> makes me think of China's facial recognition efforts.
[15:06:12] <Carbonflux> they could reach a point with that where you don't need any form of ID
[15:06:57] <Carbonflux> iirc there is a fast food chain that uses pure face recog for everything.
[15:07:24] <Carbonflux> i don't know if that would work anywhere else tho
[15:09:35] <Donno> Like for payment and order collection?
[15:10:18] <Carbonflux> yup, you just walk in and say what you want and then leave with it.
[15:10:52] <Carbonflux> all the point of sale stuff is face recog
[15:12:07] <Carbonflux> i suspect google could offer a service like that.
[15:12:41] <Carbonflux> link your face with google pay etc.
[15:13:06] <Carbonflux> then integrate it with google lens
[15:13:16] <Donno> I am sure Facebook (I am not going to say Meta) would try to out-bid that contract.
[15:13:41] <Carbonflux> i note that google lens does a fairly good job of identifying people it knows about already.
[15:13:44] <Carbonflux> ya
[15:14:50] <Carbonflux> well, someone is going to have to define the VR commons at some point if we want that sector to mature.
[15:15:12] <Carbonflux> i admit i would rather it be open source, like the old VRML effort.
[15:17:31] <Carbonflux> with facebook it would be like installing a game, but something like VRML would mean downloading lots of vector data, and textures, which is of course more practical now days.
[15:19:54] *** Joins: pulse (~pulse@user/pulse)
[15:20:19] <Carbonflux> anyway, its going to happen at some point, the "meta-VeRse," its like the atom bomb, it builds itself backwards in time.
[15:24:31] <Donno> VR headsets need to get smaller and more affordable, of course it is possible for it to becomes a "must have" where the cost is less of a barrier for those that have a fear of missing out (but the cost still needs to come down).
[15:25:58] <Carbonflux> i agree.
[15:27:52] <Carbonflux> also i am not sure full immersion VR will ever be popular, i think most people will want AR overlays, you want some area opaque but it should not totally block your vision, unless its a sex thing.
[15:29:06] <Carbonflux> even then, i would want my sex AI or visiting friend to be able to interact with my room and stuff.
[15:30:35] <Donno> I would also want it easier to fit prescription lens for VR or would even consider LASIK surgery depending. 
[15:30:51] <Carbonflux> i remember reading gravitiy rainbow, 
[15:31:23] <Carbonflux> great book, people would take over whole areas and reskin them, making them into themes.
[15:31:54] <Carbonflux> it was part of the democratic system
[15:32:57] <Carbonflux> you could vote to make your town into various fantasy templates
[15:33:24] <Carbonflux> it was a really creative book, ahead of its time by decades.
[15:33:32] <Donno> Being able to actual interact with the physical room with it would be good or at least has a lot of neat interactions (i.e Laser Tag but with VR). That said an AR / more Google Glass meets 'HUD' style approach for when you on the go would also be good, but I think privacy concerns pretty much kills some of the useful applications for that.
[15:36:21] <Donno> Yikes, Amazon wants $1,348 for a new (old stock) hard cover of Gravity Rainbow.
[15:37:06] <Carbonflux> ya, maybe people will just get over it in terms of VR, perhaps i am just to old, the idea of shutting off all my senses to the outside makes me nervous.
[15:39:14] <Carbonflux> ah, maybe i got the name wrong, i was think of something more 80s.
[15:39:36] <Carbonflux> it was one of the first VR novels i read.
[15:40:37] <Carbonflux> ah, it wa shttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbows_End
[15:40:44] <Carbonflux> heh, 2006, ah well
[15:41:00] <Donno> I don't know how I missed the fact Gravity's Rainbow mentioned the end of world war 2.
[15:41:38] <Carbonflux> heh ya
[15:41:59] <Carbonflux> too much stuff in this old brain.
[15:43:47] <Carbonflux> anyway, the AR stuff in Rainbows End is really interesting imo.
[15:46:28] <Donno> Might have to check it out
[15:48:34] <Carbonflux> trying to visualize a post singularity culture is hard imo.
