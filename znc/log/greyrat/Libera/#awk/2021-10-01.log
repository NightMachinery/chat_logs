[03:34:56] <tangy> that's still a bit over my head for the moment. mostly I'm tired, though. thx4chat'n & ttyl
[04:04:32] <nmz> emanuele6: y u do dis
[04:05:01] <nmz> you could go for a perfectly nice and simple example

[04:06:57] <nmz> I mean, yeah, but poor tangy

[04:07:18] <mute> poor poor tangy indeed
[04:09:17] <nmz> x=$a++ <- so nothing is happening here?
[04:09:35] <nmz> it returns a but doesn't increment it
[04:09:45] <emanuele6> no, it returns $a
[04:10:00] <emanuele6> and it increments $a by 1 after saving it into x 
[04:10:28] <emanuele6> " 1 2 3" becomes "2 2 3" and x="1"
[04:11:04] <nmz> but you can't increment $a because $a is a number?
[04:11:14] <emanuele6> $a is not a number
[04:11:19] <emanuele6> it's the a-th field
[04:11:37] <emanuele6> you can replace fields using $1="something"
[04:11:40] <nmz> that's what I meant
[04:11:56] <nmz> seems I'm sleepy too
[04:13:26] <emanuele6> a=1, so $1="1", so x=$1 (x=1), $a=$a+1 -> $1=$1+1 -> $1=1+1 -> $1=2

[21:43:34] <nmz-> some tips
[21:44:16] <nmz-> like if (/"name":/) {} else {}
[21:44:52] <Patsie> the whole statement can be reduced to: awk 'sub("\"name\":","") { print }'
