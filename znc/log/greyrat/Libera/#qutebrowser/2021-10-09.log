[20:06:30] <The-Compiler> earnestly: that's honestly surprising
[20:06:58] <earnestly> Although it did say js was needed to add a card, but yes indeed
[20:07:06] <earnestly> And really there is no need for javascript in such a situation either
[20:10:07] <earnestly> The-Compiler: amazon's website exists in this kind of superposition between "web 1.0" and "web 2.0" and so probably has the potential to express the older ideals.  If it was web 2.0 from the start I doubt anything would show up at all with js
[20:10:30] <earnestly> There's a few websites like this
[20:11:36] <earnestly> What's kind of amusing is web 2.0 school now trying to recapture this with 'progressive web apps', which is a very ironic name
