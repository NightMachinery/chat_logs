[06:52:08] <BrokenCog> hellos.  I'm still struggling with this Tramp error "Waiting for prompts from remote shell".  I've tried removing ~/.bashrc as well as adding a term=dumb clause to no avail.  I have removed all the stored hosts in known_hosts.  When I connect without a user name, Tramp prompts for a username but then hangs before promting for password.  If I try opening the connection from within eshell ... it works 
[06:52:21] <BrokenCog> fine.  Any suggestions would be very much appreciated.
[06:53:06] <BrokenCog> This is wih Emacs on a Windows 10 host connecting to a Linux remote.  Frustratingly, it was working last week ... I did an update on the remote (new kernel, some packages upgraded.  Nothing related to Emacs or ssh that I noticed).
[06:53:50] <BrokenCog> I have also tried connecting to a different Linux remote and get the same timeout error.

[10:04:53] <rnkn> what's the best X window manager?
[10:05:04] <aidalgol> rnkn: That's highly subjective.
[10:05:15] <famubu> Hi. I've used vim more than emacs at the moment and I miss the tabs feature of vim while on emacs. I found emacs doesn't have tabs by default (even on using evil mode). How does seasoned emacs users keep multiple files open at the same time while editing?
[10:05:15] <rnkn> n.b. not looking for opinion, only want the best...
[10:05:29] <aidalgol> I am afraid that is impossible.
[10:05:39] <rnkn> aidalgol: I want the best damn it!
[10:06:00] <rnkn> famubu: C-x C-b will give you a list of buffers
[10:06:42] <MysteriousSilver> rnkn: the one that i'm using
[10:06:47] <mns> rnkn: compile uwm from the X11R3 sources.  that's the best.  
[10:07:02] <aidalgol> famubu: I use a combination of Ibuffer, Projectile, and Selectrum for easier inter-buffer navigation than what Emacs gives you out of the box, but I think bleeding edge Emacs has tabs recently added.
[10:07:15] <rnkn> famubu: click this `(info "(emacs) Buffers")'
[10:07:21] <rnkn> damn it
[10:07:45] <aidalgol> And I think there are third-party packages to add tab-based buffer management for current Emacs releases.
[10:08:11] <famubu> Is this it? https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Buffers.html
[10:08:21] <rnkn> yep!
[10:08:38] <MysteriousSilver> yup, which you can also access with `C-h i mEmacs`
[10:09:06] <famubu> aidalgol: No, I don't really want the tabs on emacs. Just wanted to know what the emacs style of managing multiple files at the same time was. :-)
[10:09:57] <rnkn> despite my attempt to send a clickable link to the info node, if you're using `erc' and move the cursor to the end of that info link and type C-x C-e it will open the manual in emacs
[10:10:29] <mns> I've got emacs 27.2 (emacsformacosx), and I can't connect to https://elpa.gnu.org when doing package-list-packages.  I can connect via a web browser, so its emacs specific.  anyone seen that before ? 
[10:10:46] <aidalgol> mns: Do you get an error message?
[10:11:27] <MysteriousSilver> what does opening gnu.org in eww do? (both http and https)
[10:11:50] <rnkn> mns: M-x customize-option RET gnutls-algorithm-priority > set to "NORMAL:-VERS-TLS1.3"
[10:11:50] <famubu> Thanks folks. Looks like the manual is explaining it in a lucid way.
[10:12:51] <rnkn> I feel like we made little headway in discerning the best X wm

[10:13:27] <fsbot> Oh, sure. I just meant the grammatical issue of "may or may want" (which could be either "may [as in allowed] or may want [as in possibly desire]" or "(may or may) want [ as in a meaningless disjunction along with may as in possibly]"; when I intended to write "may or may not [as in tautologically imply nothing, assuming the law of the excluded middle])
[10:13:50] <mns> rnkn: twm, vtwm, jwm or stumpwm.  those would be my choices.

[16:38:00] <CuriousErnestBro> what does package-install do under the hood?
[16:38:16] <wgreenhouse> CuriousErnestBro: vanilla use-package has an _optional_ `:ensure` keyword to implicitly do `package-install` from within a use-package form

[20:54:38] <noobly> I'm getting a problem where, after a system update, a lot of packages suddenly get the "Cannot open load file" "No such file or directory" error, any idea what the underlying cause may be?
[20:55:41] *** Joins: lisp123 (~lisp123@5.30.23.247)
[20:56:14] <mekeor[m]> noobly, how did you install those packages?
[20:57:02] <noobly> i believe most were through Melpa, but pdf-tools for example may have been through my systems package manager
[20:58:30] <noobly> pdf-tools says it's installed in package-list-packages, interestingly
[20:58:58] <mekeor[m]> do the errors occur with emacs -Q, too, i wonder

[21:08:18] <Minall> seabass mekeor[m] Sorry for afk'ing, Yes, I'm using #+BEGIN_SRC js, entering the file with C-c ' gives me a code environment, without jsx enabled, if I enabled manually, the org code block stops being from org
[21:09:00] <Minall> So, I wondered if I can add something more to the programming language name, like js(jsx) or something like that on all my code blocks so, it has the proper language environment
[21:12:15] *** Joins: nekobyte (~nekoIsAL@user/nekobit)
[21:13:00] <mekeor[m]> Minall, i looked up the org-babel languages list and it looks like jsx is not supported out of the box. i guess you'd have to add it yourself to the org-babel-javascript-thing
[21:13:42] <Minall> mekeor[m] jsx seems to be something that has to be enabled to js-mode, how should I add this?
[21:13:45] *** nekobyte is now known as nekodesu
[21:13:49] <mekeor[m]> it's in the org-mode repo, afaics, called lisp/ob-js.el
[21:14:08] <mekeor[m]> i have no clue how all of this works. i'm just thinking
[21:14:22] <mekeor[m]> i don't understand how the mode is enabled
[21:14:46] <Minall> mekeor[m] Let me give it a check... You can try it, open a js file, and if you call M-x js-jsx-mode it is enabled
[21:14:56] <Minall> Another way is to just make a jsx file

[23:21:25] <bpalmer> what ended up being the root issue?
[23:21:46] <johnjay> has anybody built emacs on debian recently?
[23:22:12] <johnjay> I made a buster vm but when I did sudo apt-get install build-dep emacs it fails to find several libs due to a mirror issue
[23:22:39] <johnjay> changing the mirror in sources.list to ftp.us.debian.org/debian did the trick
