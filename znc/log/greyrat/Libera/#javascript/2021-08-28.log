[03:05:51] <sheetjs> https://medium.com/flow-type/clarity-on-flows-direction-and-open-source-engagement-e721a4eb4d8b for example, talking about flow
[03:06:00] <ljharb> sheetjs: "only being internally driven" isn't relevant to this topic
[03:06:03] <sheetjs> "we may not be able to accept PRs for Flow itself if the PRs don’t align with our priorities."
[03:06:16] <ljharb> that's a true statement about every single company-owned project ever
[03:06:29] <ljharb> facebook's just being up front about it
[03:06:44] <ljharb> if you want to be anti corporate open source, that's a different debate, that's also irrelevant to this framework topic
[03:07:29] <sheetjs> its not about a stance on corporate open source so much as the role of the community in the trajectory of the project
[03:08:31] <sheetjs> react is "facebook's internal thing" is a commentary on design decisions in contexts outside of facebook
[03:08:57] <sheetjs> the "proprietary internal" framework is ostensibly shaped by the needs of the projects for which it was designed
[03:09:04] <ljharb> right but the "role of the community" is always "only as long as it doesn't conflict", no matter what the corporate owner says
[03:09:16] <ljharb> facebook is no worse than anyone else, they're just not trying to hide it
[03:09:39] <ljharb> (in this very narrow sense, i mean. in many senses they're much worse than anyone else)
[03:09:52] <sheetjs> "hard to get worse than an internal proprietary thing" the internal proprietary thing may very well be superior to react for the intended use case
[03:10:17] <sheetjs> facebook's stance on react limits changes that would be better in the general case but not desirable for facebook's uses
[03:11:05] <ljharb> to your second comment, that is always true of every corporate-owned project without exception
[03:11:26] <ljharb> to your first comment sure, but if your intended use case matches facebook's then react would be the superior approach, we're speaking in generalities

[06:48:45] <austincheney> friend, my suggestion is to use udp streams via a node application for transmission across the network and then web socket it to the browser listening on localhost

[16:37:53] <qswz> problem solved
[16:38:16] <qswz> you can't change this behavior

[16:39:09] <qswz> max-len*
[16:39:11] <OhTheCode> i refuse to take that as an answer
[16:39:17] <OhTheCode> maybe i have to stop using prettier
[16:39:35] <qswz> use eslint for formatting code, or just tsc*
[16:39:50] <austincheney> OhTheCode, you could always write your own beautifier.  This is challenging but less challenging than it sounds given the proper AST
[16:39:51] <OhTheCode> i'm not sure if eslint can overwrite that behaviour of prettier
[16:40:18] <OhTheCode> austincheney: yep but it won't be so supported

[16:41:12] <OhTheCode> my strings that have concatentate are also split onto multiple lines which i also hate

[18:43:55] <bobdobbs> With jQuery, how can I add a data attribute to a clone of a selected element?
[18:44:22] <bobdobbs> This is what I have so far, inside a function that responds to a click event: http://pastie.org/p/2NSWqIC2ZPE8b9j9FQYF6d
[18:44:38] <qswz> here is how you can do with vanilla.js
[18:44:39] <bobdobbs> In my tests, 'attribute' definitely gets a value

[18:45:21] <ThePendulum> qswz: how do we make this more difficult and add 100kB to our codebase though?
[18:45:35] <bobdobbs> silly: I apply the method from that documentation on line 7 of my paste. But the data attribute isn't added
[18:45:51] <qswz> haha

[20:08:52] <f0xb4t> one more question, when I wish to create link to external resource i.e. https://shit.dev/crap, he creates link as: 'shit.dev/crap'
[20:08:58] <f0xb4t> how can I force https?
[20:09:27] <qswz> put https://shit.dev/crap
[20:09:58] <qswz> you can use //shit.dev/crap to link to another domain but with the same protocol (http or https)
[20:10:07] <qswz> but nowadays everything should be https
[20:10:14] <f0xb4t> just realize that
[20:10:17] <qswz> except localhost
[20:11:29] <f0xb4t> yeah but when I set it as "http://shit.dev/crap" he created: "localhost/https://shit.dev/crap"
[20:11:55] <qswz> hmm weird
[20:12:09] <f0xb4t> ok, it must be set as: "//http://shit.dev/crap"
[20:12:40] <f0xb4t> wait, no
[20:12:49] <f0xb4t> he drops ":" in such form
[20:13:03] <f0xb4t> which not what we want
[20:13:12] <qswz> <Link to="https://google.com/search?q=foo+bar">Foo bar</Link> should work
[20:13:24] <silly> its //domain.tld/path or /absolute/path or relative/path
[20:14:12] <f0xb4t> yeah but here we have situation where the origin uses http and I need to put absoute https link
[20:14:16] <f0xb4t> then different protocol

[23:28:12] <theskillwithin> is that because the holes , are defining length and not putting something in the actual memory.  or is that because the use case for holes , are for when you want to grab nth item in destructered array GreenJello ?
[23:28:42] <GreenJello> there's a has-own-property check in .filter and friends

[23:48:44] <sheetjs> ever write an offhand code snippet late at night and forget the context in the morning?
[23:49:40] <qswz> it's more the opposite for me, remember the context but forgot the solution
[23:51:15] <sheetjs> so there was something that involved writing the value x * 256 as an unsigned 16 bit integer
[23:52:17] <sheetjs> forgetting that x << 8 coerces x to 32 integer signed integer first
[23:52:25] <sheetjs> *32 bit signed integer
[23:52:53] <sheetjs> the other part, which is more confusing, is this forEach loop with a counter
[23:53:28] <sheetjs> it probably should've been a filter combined with a slice
