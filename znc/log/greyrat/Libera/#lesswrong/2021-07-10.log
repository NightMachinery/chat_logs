[00:20:32] <feep> no idea, but

[00:23:18] <dbohdan> That would be, if nothing else, pretty funny

[00:24:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern, quanticle: Ok, so one of my mother's friends and one-time colleagues back in Russia (you know my mother taught English) was a math teacher; and this friend had, herself, graduated from some super-prestigious elite specialized math high school for gifted kids
[00:24:23] <gwern> kolmogorov?
[00:24:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> (not sure, it was in Leningrad)
[00:24:31] <feep> dbohdan: I don't mind old days
[00:24:41] <Betawolf> is cx meant to be c*? I always read it as 'cocks' said really fast.
[00:24:52] <feep> Betawolf: yeah, it's "the transitive closure of c"
[00:24:54] <feep> ie. "c with amcros"
[00:24:56] <feep> ma*
[00:25:16] <feep> though I guess for honesty I should rename it to "dx"
[00:25:32] <feep> since it's much closer to D1 than C
[00:25:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> So around the time when our family was getting ready to leave (to come here), my mother's friend was also preparing to leave (for Israel) with her family. And she decided to visit her old high school, to say goodbye to some of her teachers. My mother went with her.

[01:45:42] <ggreer> this lets you try to bribe without getting in trouble for attempted bribery
[01:46:15] <meowcat> I wonder how it applies to census takers. "We're a median family of four who'd like to give you this $50 to not ask questions about how many people are actually living here and what our religion says we're supposed to do every day."
[01:46:47] <ggreer> I've never met a census taker. you just fill in a form with whatever you want

[03:47:09] <Betawolf> ah, that surge

[07:11:55] <gwern> I know people online will be upset about me cashing in on my reputation for a shabby ICO, but I'll be too busy smiling atop my giant pile of utility
[07:17:33] <gwern> bleh. 3800 by adding in an intro
[07:17:48] <gwern> ah well. no one comes to gwern.net for short breezy little sketches
[07:18:12] <gwern> this essay is as good a place as any to dunk your brain in a warm bath of contemporary cryptoeconomics
[07:18:43] <vrs> securing carbon credits with a blockchain is a bit like putting a fancy lock on a plywood door
[07:19:12] *** Joins: creek (~creek@user/creek)
[07:19:25] <gwern> vrs: yeah, your usual lame carbon credits. but *my* carbon credits are much shinier
[07:21:04] <vrs> from a cursory reading, any certified carbon credit company can mint tokens, right?
[07:21:46] <gwern> I suppose so, but they'd be ill-advised to do so unless they are doing mineralization
[07:22:32] <gwern> (because if they aren't they'll just get slashed)
[07:26:21] <vrs> I suppose what this reduces to is buying weathered basalt (or basalt options)?
[07:26:50] <creek> sequestration requires mineralization for credits?
[07:27:26] <gwern> well, you have to manufacture it. there's nowhere you can just buy fresh unweathered basalt sand that I know of
[07:28:00] <gwern> if it's natural sand, then it's reacted already; and if it's not sand, you need to grind it into sand for it to be valid, can't just dump a boulder on a beach and say 'ahhh helped!'
[07:30:20] <vrs> suppose I as a gov tell my companies to buy solid carbon credits, aka sand with a well-attested lineage
[07:31:09] <vrs> and then to guard it, so that nobody can claim the sand to be their own
[07:31:32] <vrs> how would a blockchain (or any kind of smart contract platform) improve on this?
[07:32:12] <gwern> governments can mandate lots of things. they can mandate those companies just give the president a lot of money. you're not a government, though
[07:32:30] <creek> i dont see how decentralization is accessible to this issue
[07:32:42] <gwern> right now, governments do not want to buy mineralization. maybe someday they will. but they do not now. so, what a government could do is irrelevant
[07:32:43] <[itchyjunk]> How do I become the government and the president?
[07:32:47] <[itchyjunk]> sounds like a good way to make money
[07:32:47] <vrs> ok how do you incentivize that companies buy carbon credits then
[07:32:55] <creek> it's fundamentally one of disparate interests deciding it's mutually beneficial to constrain and incentivize certain behavior
[07:33:02] <gwern> vrs: companies can buy credits for many reasons. look at stripe.
[07:33:05] <creek> that means single brokerage
[07:33:32] <gwern> indeed, why are many carbon credits bought now? many of them are not required by a coercive government, but are purchased voluntarily
[07:33:41] <creek> too bad the US isn't doing carbon credits for avoided grid usage
[07:33:48] <creek> ie solar, wind, hydro
[07:33:52] <gwern> because, there are philanthropists, or companies want to advertise that they offset their estimated co2
[07:34:13] <creek> LEED credits are bragging rights
[07:35:05] <gwern> take stripe climate. stripe would like to buy mineralization carbon removal! they are not a mining company, they can't do it themselves. they would like to buy it from someone else. but they need to be sure that the mineralization is, like, real.
[07:35:17] <gwern> if it's not real, that's bad.

[07:35:37] <creek> i went to a gem show today,speaking of mineralization
[07:35:46] <creek> there was a fordite vendor
[07:35:57] <gwern> creek: see, 'avoided grid usage' is exactly the sort of slippery untrustworthy counterfactual sort of carbon credit which tends to discredit the idea
[07:36:00] <creek> perhaps in the future there will be different carbon product vendors
[07:36:20] *** Quits: Mateon1 (~Thunderbi@user/mateon1) (Remote host closed the connection)
[07:36:28] <vrs> hm, something needs to attestably turn sand into carbon credits, and make sure that every grain of sand is sold only once
[07:36:35] <vrs> that seems to be the hard problem here
[07:36:56] <creek> gwern ok what was Square doing WRT carbon credits?
[07:37:53] <gwern> AFAIK, right now they are buying a melange of credits from standard sources, and they've set firm offers of specific prices per ton for carbon capture companies to aspire to; as to how those companies prove it to stripe, well, I guess they'll work it out between them
[07:38:32] *** Joins: Mateon1 (~Thunderbi@user/mateon1)
[07:38:47] <creek> if it's "capture" then there's no "avoided" mechanism, thus I was just adding in a tangent
[07:38:49] <gwern> vrs: the irreversibility of the sand guarantees only one sale. if you dump it in one place, it gets checked and the token approved, and then scrape it all up and move it to another beach and try to claim a second token, well, now it's no longer virgin sand. it's been reacting
[07:39:01] <creek> I presumed they were doing an avoided carbon calc, my bad
[07:39:40] <creek> even carbon capture can have issues; it must pull from the atmosphere or prevent immediate exhaust, no?
[07:39:42] <gwern> creek: capture avoids the squirminess. *no one* makes basalt/olivine sand for any reasons. there's just no point to it. except carbon capture. so, if you have X tons of basalt/olivine sand...
[07:39:50] <vrs> can I dump it in the ocean or does that mess up the weathering?

[07:40:40] <gwern> vrs: I am not entirely sure, but if you dump it in the ocean, that makes it unauditable. you could I guess dump it into the ocean after auditing, but would the auditor do it? dunno. unclear to me how that would work or if the benefit of no-reuse is worth it
[07:40:52] <saturn2> how much carbon can actually be captured this way?
[07:41:10] <nshepperd2> you'd have to dump it in front of the auditor or something
[07:41:44] <gwern> saturn2: apparently this scales to gigatons a year. the olivine deposits especially are *huge*, they claim. there's about zero reason to mine them, so all of them are untouched
[07:41:56] <saturn2> wow!
[07:42:18] <vrs> what are the energy requirements to make a ton of sand?
[07:42:20] <gwern> if I recall project vesta's presentation correctly, the real bottleneck actually seems to be a combo of mining capacity and just having beaches to dump it all on to react nicely

[10:38:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> I am reading this book review of _Progress and Poverty_, the one that won the ACX review contest, and ... it's full of nonsense
[10:38:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> The reviewer just glosses right over clear problems, absurdities, etc.
[10:39:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> For example
[10:39:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Below is a graph (source) of the boom-bust business cycle going back to the 1870's - clearly, recessions were much more frequent and severe in George's time than they are today."
[10:39:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46a9ea6a-75a2-48cf-b2a5-368a5d450f4e_700x508.png
[10:39:19] <Robomot> image/png (700x508; 229 KB)
[10:39:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> But ... this graph doesn't make any sense
[10:40:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> The placement of the grey bars doesn't seem to match what I'd characterize as recessions, at any threshold
[10:40:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Lots of dips later on, at least as great in magnitude as earlier dips, aren't highlighted in grey
[10:40:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> "After the Great Depression in the 1930's, we see a sharp decrease in the duration and frequency of recessions."
[10:41:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Taking the grey bars away, that is not how I would characterize this graph, at all
[10:41:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> At the very least it's very confusing and doesn't obviously show what it claims to show (or what the reviewer claims it shows)
[10:41:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is exactly the kind of thing the reviewer should notice and comment on...
[10:42:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or this https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89ecab7d-431a-47c8-bcce-f5726db1a770_1600x1490.png

[10:42:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Televisions cost less than a tenth as much as they did in 1998?!
[10:42:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Obviously that is false
[10:43:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> (But new cars cost the same as they did?)
[10:44:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or this:
[10:44:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Where does a thing's value come from? The prevailing theory of the day was the Labor Theory of Value which originated with Adam Smith and David Ricardo, which says that Labor is the source of value. The early formulations were a bit ambiguous, here's Smith in Wealth of Nations for instance:
[10:44:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> > The value of any commodity ... is equal to the quantity of labor which it enables him to purchase or command. Labor, therefore, is the real measure of the exchangeable value of all commodities.
[10:44:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> So... is a thing's value how much labor it takes to make the thing, or how much labor someone's willing to exchange for the thing?" 
[10:45:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> The... second one? I mean, that's what the quote says. Where are we getting the first interpretation? Not from that quote...
[10:45:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> The former is what I've always heard referred to as the "labor theory of value", but it's clearly not what Smith is saying
[10:46:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Nowadays Labor Theory of Value is most commonly associated with Marx. Marx picks a lane and says the value of something is tied to the amount of "socially necessary labor" required to _produce_ it. " ... what the heck do you mean, "picks a lane"?! These are dramatically different concepts!
[10:47:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> "George goes the other way:
[10:47:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> >   It is never the amount of labor that has been exerted in bringing a thing into being that determines its value, but always the amount of labor that will be rendered in exchange for it." ... so George agreed with Smith, etc.? Ok ...
[10:47:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> This section of the review starts by saying
[10:47:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> "George insists sloppy terminology leads to sloppy thinking. Naturally, he spends an entire chapter beating words to death to correct this."
[10:48:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> But as I read this review, I gain almost no insight into these concepts or how George thought of them
[10:48:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is terrible!
[10:48:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Who picked this as the winner
[10:48:57] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: um, it sounds like george is just ... like, how is that a labor theory?
[10:49:13] <feep> that's just a free-market/economic theory of value with labor pasted on
[10:49:27] <feep> I'd take marx's side, because marx actually says something unique
[10:50:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: It's not supposed to be a "labor theory"
[10:50:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't know why that would be a goal
[10:50:27] <feep> instead of just monetary theory of value with labor as currency
[10:50:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok, well, whatever
[10:50:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> The point is, this review is bad.
[10:51:39] <feep> I do not contest that.
[10:52:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> As for the labor theory of value, as esposed by e.g. Marx, well, it's not a very useful theory
[10:53:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> It isn't predictive of much, and if you try to apply it to set policy, or order your society, all you'll get is suffering and ruin
[10:53:33] <feep> yeap

[16:33:17] <catern> weird experience with my latest article
[16:34:53] <catern> I use the word "distributed" repeatedly, but the commenters on Hacker News have determined that if you change the meaning of "distributed" to mean "local multithreading", actually then my article is about local multithreading. and so that's what I must actually mean, and in fact *I'm* the one misusing "distributed" to mean "local multithreading"

But I think that was a real good example of what people are doing. And he's like, listen, I'm going for a job that's going to pay me more, even though that job may not guarantee him the hours that the other one was. But he's pretty confident that he can ge

[18:50:10] <two2thehead> "Rana Foroohar: "There's really two trends. There's a short-term trend and there's a longer-term trend. And when I said there was movement, there was movement at the lower end of the spectrum, which, you know, God knows was much needed, because the idea of making a living on $15 an hour is just incomprehensible. So I like the fact that you're seeing wage pressure at the lower end. Just as a quick note, 34% of unemployment right now is people quitting 
[18:50:11] <two2thehead> their jobs because they feel confident finding other jobs. So that's one of the things about the June report that I really like.
[18:50:11] <two2thehead> "But to go back to your point, yes, there is still a huge bifurcation. So you might have people who previously would have made $15 an hour, or $12 an hour being able to get $21 an hour, or $50 an hour in the case of the caller. Although to be honest, let's look at that and say, how many houses can she clean? Can she clean for eight or 10 hours? I'll just tell you one personal story.
[18:50:14] <two2thehead> "When the pandemic hit and we were unable to have anybody in the house, and my normal lady who helps us cleaning couldn't come, my husband and I said, OK, well, she comes once a week and cleans for 10 hours a day. We're going to divide that between the four of us in our household. We're going to do this. No problem. After about three hours, we all collapsed, exhausted. And I was thinking about how much of a raise I can give her when she comes back, 
[18:50:21] <two2thehead> because these are hard jobs. It's not like you're going to be able to work 10 hours a day, seven days a week doing this. So the wage is really, you have to look at it in that context.""
[18:52:52] <gwern> I think I'd like to know more about what they consider 'cleaning' because I watch cleaning ladies all the time, I've worked as a janitor, and I definitely don't 'collapse from exhaustion after a mere 3 hours'

[20:05:31] <Betawolf> I hear there are these things called Computer Science departments that are sending thousands of these creatures out to read software specifically so they learn how to write it!
[20:05:52] <meowcat> hmm. if you write a book, and i memorize it and recite it when asked, that's a performance of your copyrighted work.
[20:06:16] <Betawolf> Or if you're in any way inspired by it when you write your own book.
[20:06:18] <meowcat> even if someone had to prompt me to get me to recite it. like "hey, you! recite that work for me!"
[20:06:29] <meowcat> well no, i mean specifically the recitation case.
[20:06:39] <meowcat> not the inspiration one.
[20:07:34] <Betawolf> yes, copying things into your brain is a pervasive method of evading DRM.
[20:07:36] <meowcat> for that matter, if you prompt me with "hey, you! tell me a story about harry potter!" and i start reciting the books verbatim, i'm not "inspired"
[20:08:12] <meowcat> the same entity can sometimes emit "inspired" text and sometimes emit "recited performances of someone else's work".
[20:08:20] <nshepperd> but if you memorise the book and then someone asks you to recite page 152, paragraph 8 so they can quote it in their article, that's fair use
[20:08:26] <meowcat> i can violate copyright today, but do original work tomorrow.
[20:09:19] <meowcat> but if i memorize the book and someone asks me "describe hogwarts staircases" and i recite a paragraph from the books, that's not necessarily fair use, depending on what the purpose was.
[20:10:15] <meowcat> it would be goofy silly to say "all Copilot output is fair use" or "all Copilot output is copyvio".
[20:10:24] <meowcat> because that's not how copyright _ever_ works.
[20:10:54] <nshepperd> but if you memorise the book and then recite an original poem in the exact meter of page 152 paragraph 8 that's also fair use
[20:11:39] <meowcat> sure, but the same agent that does that might also sometimes plagiarize.
[20:12:33] <Betawolf> the deeper thing here is that programmers commonly plagiarise, consciously or not.

[20:13:26] <kuudes> swedes are noldor
[20:15:50] <Betawolf> as gwern was saying before, possibly about the same topic, as soon as AI starts doing it it gets questioned and dramatised

[20:17:37] <Betawolf> for _writing_, sure, but software? Quite rare to see code plagiarism come up. A couple of corporate lawsuits, maybe?

[20:19:57] <gwern> I had to do so many google searches for my samples
[20:19:59] <meowcat> i think it's odd that the copilot discussion has been more around "is it ok to train the model with other people's code?" and less about "can you include copilot-generated code in your work without risking copyvio?"
[20:20:36] <Betawolf> but wasn't that more about challenging the technical performance of its writing than the morality of the tech?

Lens choices, spectral sensitivity response curves in CCDs, neural processing units [etc etc etc etc etc etc].’
[21:27:16] <gwern> the coldplay photo is likewise the product of a decade or two of personal development, coaching, tattooing, haircuts & styling, framing, composition, careful curation and selection for PR, etc
[21:27:42] <gwern> whether it was a 'color' camera or a 'black-and-white film' camera is the least of the 'image manipulation' going on
[21:29:14] <dbohdan> Right
[21:29:42] <gwern> the sleeve carefully pulled back so you can see the 'sleeve', etc
[21:29:49] <dbohdan> But I think it is also true that haircuts, styling, framing, composition, and selection have become more easy for technological reasons
[21:30:31] <gwern> possibly, but the meaninglessness of the legislation is shown in that they focus only on the camera and software. they don't ban selecting the best photo, or hiring professional photographers etc
[21:30:41] <dbohdan> I remember reading a magazine review of a piece of software that let you scan a photo and preview haircuts by manually resizing transparency-masked templates.  Now an app on your phone can do it more or less automatically.
[21:30:54] <dbohdan> I agree the legislation is meaningless
[21:31:09] <gwern> now you can charitably say that maybe norway is just dumb and they didn't think about any of this. but more likely is Homo hypocritus: we *approve* of the image manipulation... as long as it's done by elites
[21:31:53] <gwern> hiring professional photographers and personal trainers and stylists is fine because only the cool 'right' people can do it; where would we be if the fat trucker's wife who shops at walmart can just slap on a 'gram filter and look hot?!
[21:32:08] <gwern> cats and dogs, I tell you
[21:32:43] <gwern> it's like I said: if a cure for obesity and high bodyfat and low muscle mass were discovered today, it'd be outlawed tomorrow
[21:33:02] <gwern> filters are at least partially a cure. so...
[21:33:42] <dbohdan> I don't know about outlawed, but I've said on this channel that a cure for obesity would be considered cheating

[21:59:05] <dbohdan> I've noticed that people who follow professional sports tend to tell stories of playing the same sports as children.  If the mechanism is that you grow up with a particular kind of competitive/challenging play activity, and you are into watching it at a pro level as an adult, then it isn't surprising people who grew up with video games are into e-sports and speedrunning.

[23:28:40] <PapuaHardyNet> I think it used a constantly reloading page or something though, which doesn't make sense from my perspective - perhaps every HTML call contained a form that had the details of the user and the last seen message?
[23:29:04] <PapuaHardyNet> that would make server-side rendering of the next "view" of the irc client sensible. Perhaps that is what you meant too, dboh
[23:30:07] <dbohdan> I don't understand what "every HTML call contained a form that had the details of the user" means
[23:31:37] <dbohdan> I meant you could render anything on the server and stream it as video to the browser.  (With MJPEG you could stream it to 20-year-old browsers.)   The form would just have a text input for what you want to say.
