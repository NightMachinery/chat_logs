[01:24:48] <Guest80> bjs: what is the point of asking that question? some people will tell you yes they know X language or language(s) and others that are more modest will say they don't know because you can't possibly know an entire language
[01:24:48] <Guest80> its a flawed question that gives no insight into original intention of question
[01:25:17] <[itchyjunk]> The point of asking that question is to open options to explain using different analogies related to different programming languages.
[01:25:27] <Decker> https://store.steampowered.com/app/1444480/Turing_Complete/  this goes through math in assembly

[01:25:40] <zetaE> Decker: I think you nailed it, is hard to understand that kinda of notation?
[01:25:42] <apotheon> Guest80: I think the point in this case was just to see if there's another language they could discuss analogously to help zetaE understand.

[01:26:09] <Decker> ya 
[01:26:11] <apotheon> Guest80: It doesn't look like it was intended as knowledge-checking as a status matter, or anything like that.
[01:26:13] <sonny> zetaE pretty much
[01:26:19] <bjs> Guest80: well if someone comes back going "yes i've done some java" or "yes i've been a C developer for 20 years" or "no i've not started programming yet" they will get different answers
[01:26:20] <sonny> more true in some languages than others tho
[01:27:19] <bjs> zetaE: yes, it's all the same just in different languages.  One thing you need to be careful of is that different computers have different assembly languages.  My phone uses Arm assembly language whereas my Desktop computer uses x86 assembly language

[02:55:56] <[itchyjunk]> so far, the programming concept carries over a lot so it's not that hard to learn the very basic it seems

[02:56:29] <KillerWasp> [itchyjunk]: You are still on time, use the arrow keys like a real programmer.

[02:56:57] <KillerWasp> no.
[02:57:01] <[itchyjunk]> Yes.
[02:57:04] <pilyn> [itchyjunk]: Link to the tower defense?
[02:57:08] <KillerWasp> real gamers also use arrow keys.
[02:57:27] <[itchyjunk]> It's not up anywhere. I would put it in github after i strip it off some personal informaiton
[02:57:43] <[itchyjunk]> most modern game uses wasd for movement and arrows as legacy
[02:57:58] <[itchyjunk]> arrows worked better when you only had one or two buttons to press.

[02:58:07] <[itchyjunk]> since you have a lot, you want right hand to be free to do so
[02:58:16] <[itchyjunk]> unless you're left handed, then arrow keys might make sense
[02:58:23] <flakland> do lefties use w,a,s,d ?
[02:58:35] <[itchyjunk]> lefties prever arrowkeys i've heard
[02:58:46] <[itchyjunk]> righties use wasd mostly, from what i've read
[02:59:16] <KillerWasp> wasd is [w] , [a] , [s] , [d] , 4 letters. It's only useful for any command in the game. You are not looking at a ZX Spectrum keyboard that does not have arrow keys. You have it there to use it, go upgrade and use the arrow keys.

[03:05:06] <[itchyjunk]> also, as the number of buttons you need to press goes up, arrow keys become less convinent
[03:05:06] <KillerWasp> That is why it is a damn habit, and it is better to develop a good practice from the beginning.

[13:57:23] <mrig> user51 well if you get your memory form the OS using memap or virtual alloc, you can give it a start point and ask it not to shuffle the placements about, then for debugging you know that any pointers to that memory will remain in the same place if you recompile some other part of your code.

[17:21:46] <smallville7123> there is this to work around
[17:22:14] <smallville7123> there is no single unified UI system that just *works* on both desktop and mobile
[17:22:43] <smallville7123> and both UI's use different languages
[17:22:43] <pyzozord> deniska: fancy!
[17:22:57] <vdamewood> QtQuick works fine on desktop.

[17:23:23] <smallville7123> so if your UI is complex it can be very difficult to maintain behaviour and look across two UI's
[17:23:24] <deniska> pyzozord: but… doing what I did is more fun, because it's shenanigans :)
[17:23:46] <smallville7123> also each UI has slight behavioural differences than the other
[17:23:52] <pyzozord> trying to decypher what is happening there
[17:24:15] <smallville7123> eg in QWidget's buttons are clickable by default, in QML buttons are NOT clickable by default
[17:24:31] <vdamewood> Or rather, I should say QtQuick works fine on both desktop and mobile.
[17:24:39] <smallville7123> in android both QWidgets and QML have issues with the IME and text input
[17:24:56] <pyzozord> deniska: are you... generating python?
[17:25:08] <smallville7123> and sometimes QT's signals can break when you remove and add layouts
[17:25:10] <deniska> pyzozord: yes
[17:25:15] <pyzozord> nice! :D
[17:25:18] <deniska> pyzozord: metaprogramming
[17:25:21] <pyzozord> I didn't think of that
[17:25:41] <smallville7123> rendering that UI component unusable
[17:25:42] <pyzozord> yeah that's a cool thing interpreted languages can do easily
[17:25:56] <deniska> pyzozord: it's not that much harder with compiled languages
[17:25:57] <pyzozord> I suppose normal languages could do that too, but it's more tricky with real machine code and stuff
[17:26:16] <deniska> pyzozord: just write to a file and call a compiler afterwards
[17:26:37] <deniska> in gcc you can even do funny things like #include "/dev/stdin"

[18:13:19] <pyzozord> literally told me not enough IQ points to get the job
[18:13:32] <pulse> IQ is a pretty bad test anyway
[18:13:37] <pyzozord> granted I was a bit tired and utterly untrained for those iq tests, but still
[18:13:45] <pyzozord> it did hurt in the ego

[18:14:15] <pulse> Just stupid
[18:14:20] <pulse> GeDaMo++
[18:14:28] <mason0> in theory IQ shouldn't test common knowledge, or education
[18:14:32] <pyzozord> yes I agree, I think if I'd practice it I would be able to pass it
[18:14:40] <pulse> They test pattern matching
[18:14:47] <pulse> So if you're good at pattern matching you'll score high, but that's not intelligence
[18:14:50] <pyzozord> no it was the mensa entry test, with pattern recognition
[18:14:51] <pulse> That's like, 0.03% of intelligence
[18:14:59] <pyzozord> makes you really tired

[18:15:43] <pyzozord> no questions, just shapes in images and circle the one that doesn't fit the pattern
[18:15:44] <Tech_8> lol
[18:15:51] <MrMobius> and yet there is supposedly a close correlation between IQ tests and doing well at university and financially later
[18:15:59] <pulse> "What do you call a horse that quacks?"
[18:16:04] <mason0> no. questions like, here's a sequence of numbers, try to figure out the pattern and continue the sequence. I'm sure you can find examples online, even from mensa

[18:16:26] <EdFletcher> Correlation is not causation 😉
[18:16:31] <pulse> MrMobius, Correlation != causation. You can correlate guitar players to living better on average too

[18:17:18] <MrMobius> lol i said there was a correlation. that is not a fallacy by itself
[18:17:25] <mason0> I doubt you can. not many guitar players make a living
[18:17:32] <ProfSimm> MrMobius: IQ was mostly invented as a tool for detecting mental issues, not about detecting people smarter than average. I.e. if you have IQ below 100 it's increasingly more and more significant, but above 100 is increasingly less significant

[21:13:50] <oldlaptop> That's kind of a funny question in that "universally supported" and "universally known" are not necessarily related to each other

[21:15:15] <InPhase> pyzozord: It makes a difference in the choice.
[21:15:51] <InPhase> pyzozord: For general purpose compiled languages, one of the best language to write compiled languages in is the language itself.  Then you only need a bootstrapping compiler to get you going.
[21:16:51] *** Quits: Atque (~Atque@user/atque) (Remote host closed the connection)
[21:17:14] <pyzozord> hmm yes the bootstrapping process indeed might be the best choice. Basically makes one independent form other languages
[21:17:25] *** Joins: Atque (~Atque@user/atque)
[21:17:25] <InPhase> pyzozord: This provides some interesting advantages in terms of testing out the language, and in terms of making sure the developers that join onto the project know and enjoy the language it's written in.
[21:17:36] <nomagno> I don't really understand what you mean
[21:17:54] <nomagno> do you want to figure out which language to write an interpreter for another language in?
[21:18:24] <oldlaptop> (C is definitely a pretty good choice for the bootstrapping compiler - probably both its implementation language and its compilation target!)
[21:18:53] <pyzozord> InPhase I haven't considered the community aspect, that's for sure and extra benefit of that approach
[21:19:01] <InPhase> pyzozord: For an interpreted language, C is not a good choice because C tends to insert maintenance unreliability and other instabilities into things that you don't need to have.  C++ would be a better choice for an interpreted language, because it also exists pretty much everywhere C exists, but lets you implement at a higher level and with more stability and reliability.
[21:19:56] <InPhase> pyzozord: You will get the same performance, but with more readable, reliable, and maintainable code.
[21:20:16] <InPhase> (If you do it right.)
[21:20:56] <pyzozord> for interpreted language s bootstrapping process is not a good idea?
[21:21:11] <InPhase> pyzozord: You don't want to interpret an interpreter.
[21:21:56] <InPhase> But!  With that said, what you do that is like this is that an interpreted language can put much of its content into a standard library and basic components that are implemented in the language itself.
[21:22:01] <sonny> pyzozord: just pick something with good tree or list data structures
[21:22:08] <sonny> otherwise it doesn't matter
[21:23:17] <InPhase> You can designated certain built-ins as native-code as-needed for performance reasons, and then put the non-performance-critical ones in the language itself.

[21:26:38] <InPhase> Yeah.  It's also possible to make languages that are both interpreted and compiled, or hybrid languages that are compiled with an engine embedded for dynamic code interpretation.  Or a jit language.  So there are a lot of middle grounds one can hit, which can slightly alter the choice of implementation language.

[23:43:03] <apotheon> vdamewood: see above statement
[23:43:40] <vdamewood> apotheon: It sounds like you relied on defaults that defaulted to using glibc.
[23:43:51] <apotheon> When doing C development, I do it on OpenBSD with Clang these days.  I sometimes run a test-compile on Linux with GCC just to check compatibility, but then throw away the results because I don't need the GCCed binaries.
[23:44:16] <deniska> nerd
[23:44:22] <apotheon> . . . so no, I'm not defaulting to glibc.
[23:44:33] <vdamewood> Well, the Linux builds are.
[23:44:52] <pyzozord> does gcc do a lot of bad things to binaries?
[23:44:58] <vdamewood> And, well, building for not-Linux is kind of irrelevant to a discussion about the problems of Linux builds.
[23:45:08] <flakland> pyzozord no but glibc is massive if you static link it
[23:45:57] <vdamewood> It's also legally complicated to statically link glibc.
[23:46:08] <apotheon> vdamewood: If you read what I actually said, you'll see that I accounted for that and don't consider that part of using glibc on a personal project.
[23:46:10] <oldlaptop> It's also technically complicated to statically link glibc.
[23:46:41] <apotheon> The code is written and used, without any resort to glibc, though I may later test build using glibc and GCC on a Linux system.
[23:46:58] <apotheon> That's not the same as using glibc in a personal project.
