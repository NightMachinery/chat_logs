[01:14:57] <transhumanist> Hi! whats the latest in virtualizing a windows desktop to ubuntu and kqemu? Is there a utility for doing this or do I need to use veeam or something to migrate the virtual machine to another system and and then install a core hypervisor and migrate it back?
[01:15:17] <transhumanist> if there is a better channel to talk about this let me know, sorry in advance
[01:16:11] <oerheks> one could kvm/virt manager , sure

[01:16:52] <oerheks> but how to migrate it back, really, i don't care
[01:17:31] <tomreyn> a windows or kvm related channel may be better suited, since this does not really seem to be related to ubuntu (other than virtualization runs on ubuntu)
[01:17:36] <transhumanist> I mean I am trying to make a micro hypervisor below the existing system ( I assume kqemu and ubuntu server perhaps)

[13:35:24] <Philip0a> Thats what I thought tomreyn. however the minimal install from USB had the firefox icon on the upper left, and I vaguely thought I had used firefox prior.
[13:35:55] <Philip0a> So it is confusing
[13:36:02] <tomreyn> what the apt source (download location) of a package is (here impish-updates) is unrelated to whether or not it was previously installed, or installed while apt is running.

[14:01:05] <bugweiser> hi all, what is the best operating system to compile gnu 'software' on?
[14:02:00] <lotuspsychje> bugweiser: polls are not really the scope of this channel
[14:02:05] <guiverc> bugweiser, there is only one answer to that that is on-topic; Ubuntu or flavor of Ubuntu GNU/Linux
[14:02:23] <guiverc> https://ubuntu.com/download/flavours
[14:02:30] <bugweiser> ok, which ubuntu should I pick 19 or 20 (from onworks.net, free remote desktops)
[14:02:54] <tomreyn> there is no ubuntu 19 or 20
[14:03:17] <guiverc> there is no Ubuntu 19... and the products using the 20 are different to this using year.month foramt (eg. 20 is different to 20.04)
[14:03:31] <bugweiser> oh, I just read what onworks says..
[14:03:58] <guiverc> Ubuntu Core 20 is more difficult & rather different to Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

[14:04:49] *** Joins: Aeilxyz (uid391113@user/aeilxyz)
[14:04:58] <guiverc> I would not recommend using Ubuntu Core 20 or any year product.
[14:05:06] <Philip0a> Oh if I used "apt install X"  and want to undo it, shall I just 'apt remove' everything listed in /var/log/apt  (the final section is the transaction I want to undo)

[14:06:30] <bugweiser> ok, so I try this 16 thing
[14:07:02] <bugweiser> OnWorks Ubuntu GNOME online, version 16,
[14:07:07] <guiverc> I'd not recommend Ubuntu Core 16 either.   Ubuntu 16.04 LTS has completed it's standard support life; it's off-topic here
[14:07:13] <bugweiser> provisioning server...
[14:07:28] <bugweiser> off topic
[14:07:30] <bugweiser> ok
[14:07:32] <bugweiser> kill server
[14:08:00] <bugweiser> though.. I can only use what onworks gives me.. unless anyone knows of another free provider without any form of questions or registration ...
[14:08:00] <guiverc> Ubuntu Core 16 cannot use `apt` type commands; it's a snap only product
[14:08:21] <Philip0a> it seems that "apt install xsane" installed 21 packages while "apt remove xsane; apt autoremove" removed 1+18 packages.
[14:08:26] <bugweiser> so that can't compile gnu software ?
[14:08:35] <bugweiser> whoops.  'software'
[14:09:28] <guiverc> bugweiser, the year format (16,18,20) signify a snap only product, contrasted to 18.04, 20.04 which use deb packages and thus can `apt install`

[14:10:48] <guiverc> bugweiser, you won't have been using Ubuntu Core 20 then, either a fake or Ubuntu 20.04 LTS for example
[14:11:07] <bugweiser> so then I should pick the 16 ?
[14:11:13] <tomreyn> guiverc: nworks.net suggests otherwise, though, i.e. "ubuntu 20" there seems to actually be "Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS". Which is one of the reasons I think bugweiser should get support directly from them, unless it's generic Ubuntu questions for supported releases.

[14:19:34] <jo-erlend> iomari891, If you mean whether you can move your root filesystem to LVM while the system is running, that's not possible. But you could add lvm to an unused disk or partition while the system is running, sure.
[14:20:29] <iomari891> jo-erlend: thanks
[14:20:31] <bugweiser> I can nnot compile it. Solving the 8 year old bug (at debian) would solve the problem also for ubuntu, you told me last week.

[23:38:40] <calligar> Hello all, I'm on Kubuntu Focal and I'm trying to compile the kernel using the procedure shown in the Ubuntu wiki, as I want to test some fixes in a wifi card driver.
[23:38:46] <calligar> The build stops during packaging, seemingly due to DKMS trying to build XFS (a filesystem I don't need right now).
[23:39:27] <calligar> If as an alternative I disable the building of XFS in the menuconfig, I get check-config complaining about that and failing the build with an error. I tried passing the "skipmodule=true" argument to the build and menuconfig commands, with no improvement.
