[04:26:04] <aquanight> how is it able to intercept these blocks?
[04:26:44] <aquanight> is there just a record of BEGIN blocks that get run? Or can Deparse actually prevent a BEGIN block from executing?
[04:29:24] <aquanight> hrm.
[04:29:44] <aquanight> no, it can't stop a BEGIN from running for rather obvious reasons
[04:30:02] <aquanight> but apparently the BEGINs are saved in an array
[04:31:09] <aquanight> there's still the option of CORE::GLOBAL:: overrides to put a stop to shenanigans but I don't know if this affects compilation of the code normally.

[06:50:37] <genio> Crypt::NaCl::Sodium so many issues right now. I don't want to re-implement it the way it was done. I figured getting an FFI implementation done would at least give me an idea of what the API should look like and how to test it properly
[06:51:38] <simcop2387> yea my designs for that have been an ::FFI that does the raw binding work, and provides some utilities for handly data structures between things and then a more idiomatic looking library that consumes the ::FFI
[06:51:54] <genio> Crypt::NaCl::Sodium can't work with any version of the library after some pretty ancient version. It relies on functions that have been yanked from libsodium for years
[06:52:21] <genio> and the oddity of some of the API just irks me. so, FFI here we come
[06:53:38] <x5c30> howdy genio. i think we ended up on similar paths (Crypt::NaCl::Sodium is a sad state of affairs). i went the other way though, and re-vamped the existing thing, cleaned up the safe memory handling, added the new libsodium things, made it a more sensible api. it's mostly implemented, but i'm not sure it'll be a release-worthy thing anytime soon, i'd be glad to bounce some ideas around and poke at
[06:53:44] <x5c30> your ffi one.
[06:54:35] <genio> awesome. and since I hold the keys to Crypt::NaCl::Sodium, if you fix it up, I'll be sure to make it happen

[19:13:58] *** u4ia_ is now known as u4ia
[19:14:26] <krismatrix> is it common for you guys to use multiple databases (in a project)? For example, I am trying to learn how to set up postgresql...and i happen to reflect on redis more recently. And I am thinking whether I should use both in my project? 
[19:15:06] <krismatrix> the redis system is basically a hash database. But postgresql is a full on RDMS.
[19:15:18] <simcop2387> depends on how you define "database" but yea using redis and pg isn't uncommon for different purposes
[19:15:20] <krismatrix> redis seems simpler (minus my confusions about how to deal with JSON objects).
[19:15:29] <Botje> krismatrix: redis is data structures as a service _and_ a pub/sub system to boot
[19:15:57] <Grinnz> i use mysql (would use pg if it was my choice), redis and elasticsearch at work, all for distinct purposes
[19:16:10] <krismatrix> Botje: What you said doesn't translate to mean something to me. Can you clarify?
[19:16:21] <Grinnz> pg also has pubsub
[19:16:28] <simcop2387> and can distribute itself across nodes/horizontally because of the way redis works and offers different promises about integrity
[19:16:35] <krismatrix> well...i am doing this for my personal project...so I can do whatever I want as long as I understand it ...and it is free.
[19:16:39] <Grinnz> pg can do most of what redis does, but redis is simpler for the specific things it's good at
[19:16:43] <krismatrix> and also to learn it well.
[19:16:52] <Grinnz> which is non-relational data
[19:16:56] <simcop2387> Grinnz: generally faster too
[19:18:22] <Grinnz> https://redis.io/topics/data-types-intro generally if you have a set of data and one of these data structures fits how you want to update and access it, redis might be useful for that
[19:18:23] <Paperbot_> Link title(s): [ An introduction to Redis data types and abstractions – Redis ]
[19:18:24] <krismatrix> You guys would recommend having the database(s) on a separate server (making that the db server) from the web server?
[19:18:44] <Grinnz> depends on how much you need to scale - you can always separate them later
[19:18:51] <simcop2387> krismatrix: basically redis stores data and retrievs it in a simpler manner, this makes it faster then pg but it doesn't do as much as pg with your data.  so fast lookups of data, use redis.  less need for speed and needing to reliably store, manipulatr, and analyxe the data, use pg
[19:19:31] <krismatrix> yes i follow. 
[19:19:48] <krismatrix> I actually don't 'need' to scale at all. But I am using the effort as an exercise to learn how to.
[19:20:39] <krismatrix> I know...my captcha system will probably function fine with redis.

[20:54:34] <Altreus> have it read from the environment and then write to that environment in the wrapper
[20:54:41] <ilmari> write it as a function then call it in a subshell?
[20:54:48] <LeoNerd> I think you've missed the question
[20:55:14] <LeoNerd> I don't think a function will work either, because the wrapper-command won't see it

[20:55:37] <LeoNerd> It's a chunk of perl I just wrote
[20:55:58] <ilmari> so you want to wrap _part_ of a shell script in a perl script?
[20:56:05] <LeoNerd> In effect, yes
[20:56:10] <LeoNerd> Hold up let me just show it

[20:56:56] <Paperbot_> Link title(s): [ Perlbot Pastebin ]
[20:57:23] <LeoNerd> It's a bit of a mess, but basically it's a wrapper around running `rsync` and putting timestamps/exit status in a little file in /var
[20:57:42] <LeoNerd> I want to extract all the messy "writing stuff to /var" into a wrapper program, so I can just call rsync via that

[21:01:02] <tirnanog> yes.
[21:01:15] <LeoNerd> And I am not scared and running screaming from this...why?
[21:01:23] <tirnanog> that's a good question.

[21:01:42] <x5c30> that's how shellshock happened. you are right to be wary.
[21:02:07] <tirnanog> LeoNerd: nothing. it gets better, though. there's no way to tell bash to ignore exported functions short of assuming responsibility for sanitizing the environment.

[21:02:55] <tirnanog> sourcing sounds like a good idea. in any case, now you know it exists :)
[21:03:21] <LeoNerd> Hrm.. is there a bash equivalent to   perl -Mfoo.pm -E'foo::bar()'  then?
[21:03:42] <tirnanog> no.
[21:03:56] <LeoNerd> Oh, no I'll just have to  bash -c "source thing; func()"
[21:03:59] <tirnanog> yeah.
[21:04:09] <tirnanog> and you can approximate a namespace in your function names, I suppose.
[21:04:16] <tirnanog> bash is pretty unfussy as to the character set.
[21:04:56] <tirnanog> foo::bar() { :; } works, for example.
[21:04:58] <ilmari> if [ "$1" = "dofunc" ]; then func(); exit 0; fi
[21:05:18] <LeoNerd> Yah I guess that's another way
[21:05:29] <tirnanog> and yes, parameters to control program flow is just fine and dandy. or env vars or whatever.
[21:05:39] <ilmari> that's what I meant by "make the script take an argument that makes it just call that function"
[21:10:24] <bkhl> OTOH, if there's no requirement to use the shell script intact, why not just do it all in Perl?
