[03:51:14] <Joanna> Has anyone ever seen that trash out tv show a few years where banks would send people to forclosed homes and sometimes nonforclosed homes and take everything in home to the dump?

[03:57:43] <Joanna> When it comes down to it there really aren’t communities anymore
[03:58:10] <Joanna> Your neighbors are mostly if not all strangers who don’t care about you
[04:00:58] <ilikeyou> depends. my neighbors thankly are super sweet.
[04:01:58] <ilikeyou> except for that one time when they tried to steal my wifi. no1's perfect :p
[04:01:59] <Joanna> Your necessities are made far away by strangers who only want your money. It’s good to have friendly neighbors but most are still probably strangers.
[04:02:30] <ajak> why are you saying it like it's the fault of the strangers?
[04:02:46] <Joanna> I’d bet your neighbors won’t rebuild eachothers homes if one is lost in a fire.
[04:03:34] <ilikeyou> condo complex. if i'm homeless, they are homeless
[04:03:51] <ilikeyou> but yes, i get your point
[04:04:05] <Joanna> Everything you can think of that communities used to do for eachother has been monetized and taxed
[04:04:50] <Joanna> And if people do try to make these sorts of communities they are stopped rather quickly

[04:18:47] <mats1> charlie wilson is the guy who claimed credit for the soviets leaving afghan
[04:19:13] <mats1> which is bullshit, pak isi did that, all the americans did was provide arms, not 1 man on the ground
[04:19:16] <Joanna> According to the quash things went downhill after the civil war
[04:19:46] <Joanna> Did the us finally leave Afghanistan?

[12:20:08] <horseface> ty!
[12:20:36] <mats1> when a snake dun git er done...
[12:22:32] <Joanna> The best solution for pipes is to strain what goes into them first ..
[12:24:04] <mats1> heres a protip, if you hate your landlord, cut up some old rags into 1-2cm wide strips, or get a large thing of wetwipes, and flush it down the toilet before you move out
[12:26:34] <Joanna> I’ve heard of people using cement
[12:26:48] <Joanna> I’ve never hated any of my landlords
[12:28:19] <mats1> cement is tricky since you have to manage the water ratio for good effect
[12:28:49] <Joanna> They will know who did it
[12:29:17] <mats1> thats a plus for some
[12:30:16] <horseface> lol i see.

[13:02:48] <Joanna> I thought everything was outsourced including software development
[13:03:12] <mats1> no, just most of the low value rungs in the chain
[13:03:40] <electr0n> I feel the government will just ban the usage (maybe even ownership) of crypto's. biden's rhetoric around them is that they are only used for illegitimate transactions.
[13:04:02] <mats1> usg can't do shit about cryptocurrencies
[13:04:24] <mats1> in fact, its not in their interest to do so, cryptodollarisation is good for usa
[13:04:55] <mats1> theres about 100bn usd in stablecoins right now, and it'll probably go to 1tn before 2030
[13:05:02] *** Quits: HiggsB (~HiggsB@93-140-151-243.adsl.net.t-com.hr) (Quit: Client closed)
[13:05:07] <jm18> they can ban what they want, people will find a way to do it if it benefits them
[13:05:35] <mats1> which is like... 1/20 of M2, that is, the monetary supply of usd is about 20tn all in
[13:06:38] <mats1> binance did trillions of dollars in trade volumes since just january, and they did it with just stablecoins and partnerships with payments processors, no banks
[13:06:55] <mats1> they have no physical headquarters or entities, what the fuck are the americans gonna do?
[13:07:54] <mats1> banning cryptocurrencies just means depriving themselves of tax revenues
[13:08:12] <mats1> doesn't change the game, like it didn't stop heroin from getting into the country
[13:08:14] <electr0n> you cannot sell anything on binance without first having to go through both normal and advanced identity verification.
[13:08:23] <electr0n> I know because I just waited 2 months to complete even the freaking basic one.
[13:08:39] <mats1> that must be new, i remember you could sell 2btc without any aml kyc once every day
[13:08:45] *** Quits: Tempesta (Tempesta@user/tempesta) (Quit: See ya!)
[13:08:57] <electr0n> times are changing ufortunatey.
[13:08:59] <mats1> and anyway, aml kyc is horseshit, remember the panama papers episode ?
[13:09:00] <electr0n> unfortunately*
[13:09:11] <Joanna> Well that’s one way to prevent hardware backdoors :)
[13:09:11] <electr0n> very much so.
[13:09:21] <mats1> people with means, just grab an illiterate and have em sign a buncha blank papers
[13:09:29] <mats1> easy.
[13:09:49] <electr0n> yea that is why I don't understand these damn supply chain attacks, you backdoor the compiler... screw the sourcecode
[13:11:23] <electr0n> its sad how these refund scams work, sometimes to the tune of 30k in CASH sent over USPS
[13:11:41] <Joanna> There are still the chance of emp waves from solar flares that would destroy all the things depending upon solid state circuitry
[13:12:16] <electr0n> i think the solar flare would fry us first... woohoo first class seats to our own bbq.
[13:12:38] <Joanna> It happened in 1800s
[13:12:49] <Joanna> Maybe I’m using wrong word
[13:13:12] <Joanna> It made the telegraphs work without electricity
[13:13:17] *** Joins: Tempesta (Tempesta@user/tempesta)
[13:14:55] <Joanna> I’m sure the military has emp weapons in development
[13:15:12] <mats1> yes, theres a whole scam industry built around it
[13:15:24] <mats1> only thing that really works is a nuke
[13:15:35] <mats1> nobody cancelled physics
[13:15:46] <Joanna> They can stop computerized cars by sapping them right ?
[13:16:02] <Joanna> Zapping
[13:16:34] <mats1> i think doing the math here would be an instructive exercise
