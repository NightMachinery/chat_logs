[03:06:33] <ManofLetters[m]> Here we like ASCII art, so here's an SDL2 cursor shape I've just drawn (https://github.com/LambdaHack/LambdaHack/blob/974d25a2aed2ad45e9b5ab2653f17c30f484f8c0/engine-src/Game/LambdaHack/Client/UI/Frontend/Sdl.hs#L407)... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/53564a9ffde31ffcb71fada852a1e3ee47e2825f)
[03:07:17] <ManofLetters[m]> bummer it scrolls the picture, but shows only about half at a time in my Matrix client
[03:07:36] <f-a> haha works fine
[03:07:41] <f-a> https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/53564a9ffde31ffcb71fada852a1e3ee47e2825f
[03:08:29] <ManofLetters[m]> oh, that's how IRC shows it? giving this link you pasted?
[03:09:07] <ManofLetters[m]> actually, I can click a button top right and it's shown in full in Matrix as well
[03:09:44] <f-a> yeah
[03:09:53] <ManofLetters[m]> looks better black on white (i use dark mode in Matrix), because that's the setup for which it's designed (# is white, . is black)
[03:11:50] <ManofLetters[m]> BTW, random observation: discord has a much more square font shape
[03:12:26] <ManofLetters[m]> I wish readable square fonts were physically possible
[03:12:46] <ManofLetters[m]> (for the latin alphabet)
