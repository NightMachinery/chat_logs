[08:54:13] <bookworm> toro: which Ubuntu is that?
[08:54:21] <toro> lemme check quick
[08:55:02] <toro> Welcome to Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS 
[08:55:27] <toro> im upgrading nodejs from source, its okay , idk if theres a way to make the installer halt if prereqs arent in place
[08:55:40] <toro> we have only been testing this on the side
[08:57:07] <bookworm> (they have a ppa)
[08:57:11] <bookworm> as in upstream
[08:57:47] <bookworm> and yes, we can require that in the package so that it doesn't install
[08:57:59] <bookworm> LTS releases must die
[08:59:27] <toro> ah crap how do i install that?
[08:59:34] <toro> i can abort this compile its a slooow box
[09:00:53] <toro> i swear im only getting spanish google resulys on this because im in mexico lol
[09:01:39] <bookworm> https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md
[09:01:51] <bookworm> don't pipe to sudo bash please
[09:02:10] <bookworm> download it, read the script, then execute as root
[09:02:42] <toro> ok ty
[09:03:26] <toro> ii  nodejs                           14.18.1-deb-1nodesource1 
[09:03:28] <toro> that should do

[09:13:10] <toro> ok its working and was painless other than that
[09:13:11] <toro> ty
[09:13:58] <bookworm> not true ;P but we are working on it
[09:14:05] <toro> hahaha
[09:14:46] <bookworm> as for login, how do you suggest that would work?
[09:14:57] <bookworm> you can have multiple networks after all
[09:15:17] <toro> well we want to default to what you call public mode
[09:15:37] <bookworm> the good thing with ldap is that you can write whatever as long as you talk ldap to TL
[09:15:40] <toro> but for private mode, i would be fine with sasl login instead of creating users in sql/sqlite or whatever
[09:15:47] <bookworm> so they way to do that is to hook there
[09:16:04] <toro> i cant seem to get anope to do ldap but im upgrading that next and will try again in newer version
[09:17:05] <toro> that would be fine too ofc
[09:18:18] <toro> for the moment i was going to run a second daemon on another port
[09:18:23] <toro> and when they click i have a password
[09:18:31] <toro> it will refresh to the private version
[09:20:10] <toro> figured id wait to upgrade to 4.3 before going crazy w customization

[15:09:23] <c014> What irc bot is the best? is it still eggdrop?
[15:11:14] <Jay2k1> while i have no answer to that question, i think eggdrop still uses DCC chat for control which thelounge does not support, just saying ;)
[15:11:25] <c014> ah that's a good point
[15:11:35] <c014> Eggdrop was always a bit of a hassle getting up and running

[17:51:35] <xnaas> what's all this about /search in I see in the commits? I don't see anything in https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/blob/master/defaults/config.js about any settings for it
[18:01:44] <Activ8> damn I just saw the rc.1 - updated now all good so far
[18:02:17] <Activ8> it's not a setting it's automatic
[18:04:21] <Activ8> oh wait what - thats for prefetchMaxSearchSize 
[18:04:58] <Activ8> no it's not my bad confused
[18:05:27] <Activ8> the /search is automatic I think, turns off when search isn't available
[18:06:12] <shadoozo> probably based on the messageStorage

[23:18:19] <arju> Hello
[23:18:40] <arju> I'm trying to connect to a self-certificate server on The Lounge but I get >Connection closed unexpectedly: Error: self signed certificate
[23:18:48] <arju> Is there a way around this?
[23:22:26] <arju> Normally in mIRC, my previous client, I could create an OpenSSL certificate within the app to connect through but I don't see how I can implement one in The Lounge
[23:23:14] <xnaas> arju: just uncheck the box for requiring a valid (signed) SSL certificate. 
[23:23:39] <xnaas> The connection will have an ugly ⚠️ icon, but you can hide it with CSS.

[23:33:19] <arju> xnaas: I figured I can do it like that, but it's mainly the reason I'm asking for an alternative way.
[23:33:38] <arju> Is there really no other solution I could use to maybe create an SSL certificate for my own connections?
[23:33:42] <shadoozo> You can change the cert?
[23:34:38] <arju> Do you know how I can do that?
[23:34:48] <shadoozo> Depends on what ircd software you use
[23:35:09] <shadoozo> so you're probably better off searching for the docs of that software on how to change the cert
[23:35:56] <arju> I see

[23:39:59] <xnaas> test
[23:40:02] <xnaas> weird
[23:40:25] <xnaas> on rc.1 and it randomly said "new message" after arju's "I see" but there was nothing
[23:40:36] <xnaas> I'm guessing it was his leave message, since I don't see him here now
[23:40:46] <xnaas> but the message is nowhere to be seen, even collapsed...
