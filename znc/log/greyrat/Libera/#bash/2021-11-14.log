[05:34:51] <pendarsoheil> Hi, I have a bash script that reads JSON (jq) in a loop. I am using it in a fashion where I use `jq` to read each field into a bash variable. My first question is in regards to the mechanism of bash's subshells. From what I know, it creates a subshell for each `jq` process. Since there is a limit to how many processes can be run by any user, does bash throttle the while loop (noticing performance degredation in my script)? My second question would
[05:34:51] <pendarsoheil> be about the performance of processes in general. IIRC opening processes is resource heavy. Is this due to IPC sockets (disk latency vs memory latency)?

[05:37:04] <ormaaj> there's no ipc
[05:38:11] <phy1729> spawning processes is heavy due to fork and exec. It's mostly negligble unless on cygwin and if it's not and you really need the speed, bash is the wrong language for you

[06:04:30] <ormaaj> pendarsoheil: the basic cost for running external programs is initally syscall context switching overhead that will be somewhat hardware dependant. Forks are relatively cheap. exec is where most of the work happens. Speed depends on many factors (page cache, binary size, the dynamic linker / libraries used / textrels / PIC, runtime size and performance, other details...)

[15:34:38] <ormaaj> maybe. I can imagine a regex that simply omits ^$ semantics though it forces you to define your own anchors as a pattern that have to consider their entire input as their context. A reconfigurable ^/$ is simpler and faster implementation-wise.

[15:47:22] <earnestly> That only works because the filesystem is defined to never contain nul bytes in filenames

[15:48:50] <earnestly> Consider the difference between nul for filenames and : as separator for PATH.  There is no strict requirement that directory names may not contain : but adding one effectively makes it impossible to use in PATH

[15:52:12] <rendar> earnestly, i think that if modern keyboards had NUL button, PATH will use NUL char to separate directories, its safer. The only thing is that NUL is not easily representable with a keyboard
[15:52:20] <rendar> that's just my .02$
[15:52:25] <ormaaj> It's a problem of C's string handling functions. C doesn't really have strings. They're essentally defined in terms of the conventions of the functions that operate on them. Of course you're free to redefine what a string is. You can simply no longer use the standard functions.

[22:28:18] <wikan> well I found dict like type now - so maybe i do not need it
[22:29:58] <ormaaj> `typeset -[attrs] "$var"` or `typeset -n ref` are the main ones. `printf -v "$var"` and associative arrays can apply to some of those applications.

[22:54:43] <twkm> wikan: bash doesn't have dictionaries, so i'm afraid you designed for some other language praying you could wedge it into bash.  probably you can, painfully.  apparently see ormaaj's link.
[22:55:36] <ormaaj> ha.
[22:57:11] <twkm> paul424: for solutions to using git to achieve the result you want try #git.
[22:57:27] <wikan> i did what i need ;)
[22:57:29] <paul424> twkm, sure but is should be overwritten by git ?

[23:26:15] <podeni> Hi everyone, I'm curious if it's possible to do whis in a one liner, without storing data in memori (e.g. like in an awk array): given a CSV with two columns, is it possible to sum the values on the second column for each value on the first column? e.g. given the pairs a,1 a,3 b,2 produce the pairs a,4 b,2 (each pair will be on its own line)

[23:35:56] <podeni> I'm fine if the disk is used for temporary storage (like sort does it), but the file exceeds the amount of memory on the machine, so it can't all be held there.
