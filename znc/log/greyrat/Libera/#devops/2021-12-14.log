[18:40:09] <nakedeyes> hello everyone. i thought using object storages for readonly mounted files is completely okay and good practice, supported by various softwares, docker or kubernetes to name a few. unfortunately, it is not seem to be the case. the benefits i liked in s3: on one end, it is easy to just drag n drop files, the other end (as it thought) could mount it as RO content. how common is to use object storages to rarely
[18:40:11] <nakedeyes> accessed files, shared accross multiple instances, mounted even simultanesously? any alternatives you'd suggest to check?
[18:43:26] <rawtaz> nakedeyes: better start in the other end - what is your use case, what do you need to do?
[18:43:46] <rawtaz> block storages work fine generally speaking i think. whether it suits your needs and requirements depend on what youre trying to do
[18:45:05] <nakedeyes> i have some static content, assets, files and i want to make distribute them. store at only one place, access from 'anywhere'
[18:45:23] <slaughter> Yeah starting on the other end is a good idea. That said, mounting S3 as storage is a fruitless endeavor. S3 as storage works great, but you're gonna need to use the API. It doesn't work well for static volumes/FUSE/whatever weirdness Docker/K8s might be doing to mount it
[18:48:35] <nakedeyes> slaughter: yes, skimming through the interfaces and docs, it screams that is really off with this, only non-native solutions providing this feature.
[18:48:42] <rawtaz> nakedeyes: using s3 for static content, assets, files to distribute them is generally what a ton of people do. it boils down to how you need to access these resources
[18:49:08] <rawtaz> so again, what is your actual use case - how do you need to access those things? you said mount, in what way or why do you need to "mount" it, and on what systems are you talking about?
[18:51:18] <nakedeyes> rawtaz: these static files need to be accessible in containerized scenarios, usually docker locally or k8s in cloud.
[18:52:12] <rawtaz> mhmm. and by what software in them? what are files used for?
[18:54:49] <nakedeyes> these files contain 'context-specific' data read by the application, custom db seeds, unique configuration files. 
[18:55:34] <nakedeyes> these are webapplications, dotnet golang mostly
[18:56:14] <rawtaz> are those context specific files used just for the application or is it something that you want to serve to users of the webapps?
[18:56:46] <rawtaz> the two examples you wrote sound kind of like internal files that arent needed to be accessed by anyone but the app itself, e.g. to start up or initialize
[18:56:48] <nakedeyes> it has internal use, db-seeding is a good example.
[18:58:00] <rawtaz> so; where does the "mount" aspect come into the picture? cant you just tell these applications a URL where they can fetch the files?
[18:58:26] <rawtaz> or perhaps we have different interpretation of what you mean by mounting :)
[19:03:58] <nakedeyes> yes that could be a route to take. thanks it's going to help me. the other part any good tips/readings on db seeding best practices? 
[19:06:17] <rawtaz> honestly it totally depends on your entire architecture as a whole, but in larger environments i dont think that these webapps would even be concerned about seeding a database or similar. lall they do is just serve whatever is in the database. the database and its contents is managed separately
