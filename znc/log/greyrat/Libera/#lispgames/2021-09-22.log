[05:22:27] <flatwhatson> the announcement post says "#lispgames Freenode IRC", shouldn't that be Libera.chat?
[06:12:06] <aeth> yes, freenode is dead
[06:12:15] <aeth> probably just copy and pasted from last time
[06:13:45] <Menchers> freenode's dead but I wonder if there's still a corpse network you can connect to
[06:13:52] <Menchers> with just andrew lee on it
[06:26:04] <aeth> maybe
[06:26:22] <aeth> ##apocalypse is the channel for that but I haven't really been following what's going on there in the past month or two because it's boring now

[09:53:00] <Menchers> #freenode has only 352, members, network has only 5429 total
[09:53:10] <Menchers> pretty dead and boring yeah

[13:23:41] <borodust> first, do you have anything in ~/quicklisp/local-projects ?
[13:24:07] <borodust> other options is to see what quicklisp is doing by interrupting the hanging function
[13:25:16] <borodust> C-c C-c in emacs, i suppose
[13:25:16] <borodust> and see what is in backtrace, where it hangs
