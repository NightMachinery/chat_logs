[01:57:14] <oldgalileo> https://mjmwired.net/kernel/Documentation/firmware_class/README
[01:57:25] <oldgalileo> where it describes the timeout for a firmware loading operation
[01:57:37] <TJ-> rendar: how about the "Browse removable media when inserted"
[01:57:38] <n4dir> pretty sure xfce also has the mount-usb in the gui-settings.
[01:57:45] <ayecee> oldgalileo: different in what way
[01:58:01] <oldgalileo> Right? Because that's a udev event vs. the kernel firmware load operation, so the udev timeout shouldn't impact that specific kernel operation

[02:00:07] <TJ-> rendar: "systemctl status udisks2"
[02:00:08] <oldgalileo> the udev.conf's `event_timeout=` option would be the only thing I could image would relate to the problem of trying to write to the sys/class/firmware/timeout attribute

[02:03:08] <TJ-> rendar: if your USB device doesn't match any of those rules udisks won't be triggered on device insertion
[02:03:12] <n4dir> since i use linux, and mainly debian, it has automount. And that are quite a few years
[02:03:23] <akoana> ^^confirmed

[02:05:11] <TJ-> rendar: get the ID of your USB device from "lsusb" and ensure there's a rule that would match it

[04:38:13] <webby> I've been wondering if those who use linux for creative works like art or animation they do the actual creation on a linux desktop or if they just use linux as a rendering farm. Because it's very easy to setup a linux rendering farm, but I figure equipment probably doesn't have linux drivers.

[06:23:08] <weaksauce> there is a `locate something` in an alias
[06:23:35] <weaksauce> i would have thought that ran at point of use though

[07:58:14] <muhblockchain> pointing out facts about linux is zealotry, ok
[07:58:23] <ornxka> isnt it kind of weird how computers are deterministic and referentially transparent but making them not execute random assembly code suddenly gets all stochastic and "its about stacking the odds in your favor"
[07:58:27] <ayecee> opinions aren't facts
[07:58:37] <muhblockchain> linux doesn't self protect almost at all, besides like what, kernel addr random and NX bit
[07:58:39] <ornxka> i understand that this is literally true and the current state of affairs but it boggles my mind

[07:59:29] <ayecee> apparently harder than your simplified mental model allows for
[07:59:35] <muhblockchain> bolting on RBAC rules (like selinux) to be run by kernel that can't even protect itself is stacking layers on top of unprotected fundament

[11:36:01] <PMunch> Hi, I'm running a web server and I'm seeing some weird behaviour with OOM. Essentially looking at the journal for my server process it shows that it gets "out of memory" and then restarted. But looking at the memory consumption the server has plenty of unused swap space, so what is going on here?

[12:25:08] <PMunch> Okay, did some changes and it seems like it's better now. Set the OomNiceness=-17 in my service so the server will never be killed, and I also modified the server slightly to use less memory. The combination should hopefully keep it from triggering an OOM, and if it does it shouldn't bring the server down.

[18:19:35] <hexnewbie> When I see something like that, I first go to curse at whoever put together an OS that would give such error, *then* to line 60
[18:20:00] <Dagmar> Usually it's because someone had a CPAN-installed thing and they've broken their @INC paths somehow
[18:20:02] <brutser> CoderCop: that's a drastic solution it seems right?
[18:20:10] <Dagmar> i.e., they broke their system
[18:20:36] *** Joins: EriC^^_ (~e@178.135.3.221)
[18:20:46] <hexnewbie> Syntax error in /usr/lib/***.{pl,py} certainly suggests broken system (I've seen it in Debian stable packages though)
[18:20:49] <Dagmar> Usually you just unwind the mess, remove the user-miscompiled crap from ~/, and install a proper distribution-built package to replace the piece
[18:21:02] <brutser> CoderCop: i get the exact same error on a clean install so it's rather some dependancy not installer or config wrong or whatever
[18:21:12] <Dagmar> hexnewbie: Except this is perl.  A require failure means literally a specific file it wanted is missing

[18:21:53] <varaindemian> mrfb: any copy paste / even a simple word would cause this issue. Sometimes is does, sometimes it doesn;t. For example after rebooting the VM/Virtualbox I can easily copy paste without an issue
[18:22:14] <Dagmar> There are a whopping four require statements in that file, referring to four modules, one of which is a built-in

[18:22:24] <CoderCop> brutser: It just doesn't make much sense unless something else is going on. That would imply that they somehow overwrote part of the install or two different packages install different versions of the same file. I would bet that it is a version compatibility issue instead, but I don't know enough to be sure.

[18:23:19] <hexnewbie> Ah, yeah, I read that wrong.
[18:23:19] <Dagmar> Sometimes it means the user has been careless with CPAN and has mangled something in their home-dir installed packages which is breaking the loading process
[18:23:29] <brutser> CoderCop: I already wrote a request at obmenu-generator on github
[18:23:30] <Dagmar> ...usually becuase they set PERL_INC to something stupid

[18:24:22] <brutser> Dagmar: oops sorry, i not noticed you were replying

[18:27:53] <Dagmar> brutser: yeah it would but perl is actually really easy to debug when it comes to stuff like that
[18:28:06] <Dagmar> This is why I suggested maybe someone has broken CPAN-installed modules in their homedir
[18:28:33] <Dagmar> When a blisteringly common module like GDBM fails, it's generally the user's environment

[18:29:12] <Dagmar> Perl has an absurd number of self-tests involved during the compilation process, and it would be mad for a distribution to *not* run `make test` during the build of release packages as a sanity check

[23:37:18] <MrElendig> while it wouldn't be that hard for them to submit a sasl patch to it
[23:37:21] <iLinux-OS-User> iLinux-OS-User gives mrfb a Hamburger!
[23:37:28] <MrElendig> and make their irc client actually usable in 2021
[23:37:42] <iLinux-OS-User> AFK
[23:37:56] <MrElendig> other than that for "consumer" irc usage, polari is quite nice
[23:37:57] <mrfb> for me, no sasl is directly a no-go
[23:38:30] <MrElendig> eg the built in pastebin feature
[23:38:31] <mrfb> well, the UI is clean, but that easy when you don't have nearly 5% of a normal irc client

[23:40:34] <mrfb> I think it's stages
[23:40:43] <MrElendig> mrfb: polari is based on telepathy which is a kde project :p
[23:41:09] <mrfb> well, based on whatever, is a waste of time in my humble opinion

[23:51:56] <mrfb> mix that with ripgrep, and you can also do searches inside docs

[23:53:49] <WeetBix> Hello everyone.  I am looking for a company that sells good linux laptops.  Anyone happen to have a good link/URL...
[23:54:12] <mrfb> Slimbooks, Tuxedo computers and system79
[23:54:14] <uwharrie> WeetBix: lenovo.com dell.com

[23:54:22] *** Joins: Crescendo (~Crescendo@user/crescendo)
[23:54:28] <mrfb> that, not 79 XD
[23:54:46] <cuppajoe> System76 is great. I am typing this from my oryx pro. very nice quality.
[23:54:55] <mrfb> Slimbooks and Tuxedo are from EU, system76 states
[23:55:14] <mrfb> most system76 machines are rebranded slimbooks and tuxedo by the way
[23:55:53] <DLange> they all buy at Clevo
[23:56:07] <DLange> (ie the barebones come from the same Chinese company)
[23:56:18] <uwharrie> yeah, you could likely alibaba a clevo cheaper than any of them for the exact same machine
[23:56:33] <DLange> right, but warranty will be an issue
[23:56:55] <uwharrie> is system76 any better in that regard these days?
[23:57:03] <mrfb> so all rebranded clevo machines then?
[23:57:15] <DLange> no idea, uwharrie
[23:57:45] <THE_GFR|WORK> clevo sucks
[23:57:54] <NGC3982> mrfb: that what really nice. although, made a script and referenced the script in the alias. worked really well.
[23:57:59] <NGC3982> thank you
[23:58:00] <cuppajoe> apparently, their customer support is supposed to be good, but i dont know personally
[23:58:07] *** Joins: sumthing1980 (~sumthing1@94.54.64.154)
[23:58:41] <THE_GFR|WORK> Clevo being a chinese company I would consider their customer support to be less than stellar and no personal experience
[23:58:43] <mrfb> WeetBix: if you want an sturdy battletested laptop for years, just buy a thinkpad
[23:58:47] <uwharrie> they burned a bunch of people in the community in their early days so a lot of us still don't recommend them

[23:59:45] <NGC3982> mrfb: also colors so im hyped now
[23:59:47] <mrfb> and if budget is not a problem, well, serie T or X carbon, choose your poison
[23:59:54] <uwharrie> X and T series specifically, not some of the others that were rebranded to take advantage of the name
