[17:38:29] <kline> to expand, the rules for flying say you have to see something to avoid hitting it, and one of those things is the ground. this means in bad weather, you cannot fly below a certain height if the fog/rain is bad enough that your vision is obscured
[17:38:55] <kline> sometimes the "floor" that you cannot go below is sufficiently high that you cannot follow the approach path, so a runway becomes unusable

[17:45:16] <kline> youll note it hasnt happened everywhere else because the rest of the world didnt allocate 5G next to flight safety
[17:45:34] <kline> but i suspect its going to be related to how the FCC does frequency auctions
[17:45:43] <riv> ah interesting!
[17:46:11] <kline> specifically, im willing to bet that the cell industry noted that the frequency block right next to flight safety was cheap as fuck and so bought it
[17:46:31] <kline> and then the aviation industry got mad independently because _their_ regulator was unhappy
[17:46:43] <kline> (FAA)
[17:46:56] <summonner> the problem was known for a long time, that 5G bandwidths can affect the digital altimeters, but it wasn't actioned as a cost until it "became" necessary
[17:47:33] <kline> summonner, the core of this is "why did the cell market ask for/fcc allocate the bands right next to radalts"
[17:47:40] <kline> its not a technical requirement to put it there
[17:48:11] <riv> > Those who participated in the C-band auction – namely Verizon and AT&T – spent record amounts, to the cumulative tune of more than $81 billion, on precious mid-band spectrum for 5G. This, only to be told later in the year that they would threaten airline traffic if they were to actually use the spectrum for commercial purposes.
[17:48:15] <riv> case closed
[17:48:22] <summonner> from what I read in the pilots chatter, they were supposed to get upgraded hardware, that the bandwidth was becoming available
[17:49:07] <summonner> it just kept getting put of and put off
[17:49:13] <kline> the cell market is currently pleading for govt handouts to replace their backbone and saying that its not possible to buy non-huawei kit out of their profits, so i dont think that was ever the case
[17:49:29] <iDrougge> Didn't old satellite broadcasting (the kind that required antennae 1,5 m in diameter) use the C band?

[18:11:08] <pushcx> them were removed by the submitter or a mod. The badness increases with story score.
[18:12:32] <pushcx> So I'm probably going to add this in some fashion to story ranking in Story#calculated_hotness, just not sure yet if it should be the subtracted difference between them, the proportional difference, etc. Ideas welcome. https://github.com/lobsters/lobsters/blob/0ef4f8cd172c3596b29c69251d601c12a8b9ee7a/app/models/story.rb#L366

[22:42:26] <riv> where would you host data related to the code? like a bunch of test images
[22:42:45] <pe> There is git LFS.
[22:44:36] <pe> Haven't really worked with it, except as a user a few times.
[22:49:31] <bkhl> There's also Git annex, if you want to keep the data completely separate from Git.
[22:49:51] <bkhl> Like if you already have a data repository somewhere and just want to link to files in there.

[23:36:18] <pe> Alt is Option, Windows is Command.
[23:36:18] <JordiGH> I need a right control key. :-/
[23:36:33] <JordiGH> So it does work or do I first need to get permission from Tim Apple?
[23:36:40] <pe> It works like that.
[23:36:51] <JordiGH> And it'll handle the right control key, right?
[23:36:54] <JordiGH> And right alt?
[23:36:57] <JordiGH> That's what I care about the most.
[23:37:09] <pe> iTerm2 supports left alt as non-AltGr.
[23:37:30] <JordiGH> And right control? I need it for Emacs. :-/

[23:38:00] <JordiGH> And M-x is right thumb on right alt, left ring finger on x.
[23:38:51] <technomancy> JordiGH: you were unsuccessful in getting your operating system of choice?
[23:39:13] <JordiGH> They just sent me a 400 dollar Apple keyboard that due to lack of right control key for me is just a very light paperweight.
[23:39:21] <technomancy> lmao
[23:39:23] <JordiGH> technomancy: Yeah, they said "lol no"

[23:40:20] <epilys> I got a trackball keyboard that I found out lacks a middle mouse button. That's my paperweight

[23:54:07] <iDrougge> JordiGH: You can actually remap caps lock to control in the system preferences.
[23:54:28] <JordiGH> iDrougge: That's great, but I need a physical key on the right side of the keyboard too that I can map to control.
[23:54:38] <JordiGH> I use modifier keys on both sides of the keyboard.
