[00:42:43] <bomb> or "heartbeat" more technically
[00:43:38] <Suchiman> bomb: kinda yeah, normally you would send "stop now" but you can't send that when you're out of range so it sends "keep going" until you press the button or it's out of range at which point the watchdog on the receiver expires and kills it

[02:50:38] <Suchiman> also it's cross platform, yada yada yada https://dot.net/
[02:51:59] <Suchiman> It also has good command line tooling and is independent of visual studio if that's your thing
[02:52:12] <maroon> the modpow i'm using comes from a dll compiled in Rust, and it's literally 5x faster than biginteger.modpow(), but someone using OpenSSH to call these openssl functions is able to call openssl much faster than that

[08:07:40] <WillPittenger> Ah.  I had to change the target and then change it back.
[08:12:47] <teegee> what's the point of assigning an empty delegate to your eventhandler like this if you do a null-check anyway before you invoke? It keeps popping up: public event EventHandler<bla> SomethingHappened = delegate { ];
[08:13:29] <teegee> or is that yet another dodgy way to get around green squiggles on the definition when you have nullable enabled?
[08:13:36] <irwiss> that's so you don't have to null check
[08:14:07] <teegee> what's wrong with null checking?
[08:14:32] <irwiss> nothing, but before ?. operator was available the null checking was a serious chore
[08:14:35] <teegee> surely an empty delegate costs more cpu cycles than a null check
[08:15:28] <irwiss> cpu cycles aren't relevant for 99% events tbh
[08:15:33] <teegee> hmh, fine. I'll try to remember to hand out old-fart hats to people who do that :)
[08:15:42] <irwiss> cause if you trigger them in a tight loop then something is a bit off

[13:34:26] <CoderGuy> when doing custom variable types in c# is it possible to have someclass a = "assign this way";
[13:34:50] <Suchiman> CoderGuy: you can have an implicit conversion from string to someclass
[13:35:30] <CoderGuy> Suchiman, cool can you also have a way of via implicit assigning it to either an array or a string?
[13:35:52] <Suchiman> CoderGuy: you can have multiple implicit conversions

[13:44:04] <Suchiman> MaNa2k: no, you can define implicit conversion operators on any type (struct or class), the only constraints are that you must be able to modify one of the two types involved in the implicit cast to be able to add the conversion there and general guidance says that implicit conversions should be data loss / precision loss free

[14:10:50] <CoderGuy> okay Suchiman dynamic appears to be the answer
[14:10:52] <CoderGuy> BUT
[14:10:58] <CoderGuy> obviously not a good solution however it does work
[14:11:00] <Suchiman> maroon: btw. https://gist.github.com/Suchiman/f70ee23d229ff4fe409917f37dc5ab57 comparison
[14:11:35] <Suchiman> CoderGuy: variables declared as dynamic are just "object" under the cover and use "automatic reflection" to work with them
[14:12:02] <CoderGuy> ic but they can work at run time inside a loop?
[14:12:36] <Suchiman> CoderGuy: ofc they can :P they're just not as fast as statically typed code due to boxing and reflection overhead
[14:12:43] <CoderGuy> ic ic
[14:13:03] <CoderGuy> well considering all of this i'll probably just go either the normal route which is to recursively solve
[14:13:10] <CoderGuy> OR the tree based route which removes this array issue
[14:13:24] <CoderGuy> but this was fun to explore
[14:13:43] <CoderGuy> I take it in javascripts case, everything is dynamic to begin with so it's always trash?
[14:14:50] <Suchiman> CoderGuy: yeah
[14:15:08] <CoderGuy> very interesting
[14:15:50] <maroon> Suchiman, in that brief test, openssl was around 280% faster than my existing method from a dll compiled in Rust. but now that i substitute it into the actual program, openssl is about 60% faster. i'll take it, but i'm not sure where the difference went. it's possible that the 2^8192-small number isn't representative of normal numbers, and that openssl was able to 'cheat' somehow

[14:17:25] <Suchiman> CoderGuy: although to be fair, they invested a LOT into the javascript optimizers and JIT compilers to be able to emit code comparable to statically compiled code, as long as the code is more or less written like statically compiled (e.g. in the first few runs of the code it will sample which types are being used and then recompile the method for that specific type, adding type checks that fallback to slow code if another type is passed)

[14:18:21] <Nasp> Suchiman:  How much faster is it compared to .NET 5 ? :D
[14:18:25] <Suchiman> xD
[14:18:45] <CoderGuy> my favorite was the "animation loop"
[14:18:49] <CoderGuy> wow what a cool thing that is
[14:18:58] <biberu> CoderGuy: performance issues aside dynamically typed code can be much harder to reason about
[14:19:17] <biberu> CoderGuy: and you obviously won't get any assistance from any compiler
[14:19:18] <CoderGuy> oh sure i'm just listen javascript kinda created this problem because it didn't stop me first lol
[14:19:36] <Nasp> I can't find my project where i was playing with bigints
[14:19:43] <CoderGuy> it was like "go ahead, nest those arrays" so here we are, attempting to see what it would look like in c# where it's like "don't do that...I mean you can but don't" lol
[14:20:03] <Suchiman> maroon: hm so .NET 6 is 56% faster than .NET Framework 4.8 and openssl is 60% faster than .NET Framework 4.5?
[14:21:03] <maroon> no, the 60% is comparing openssl vs a 3rd party dll from a rust library, that was like 4-5x faster than built-in dotnet 4.5
[14:21:20] <Suchiman> maroon: ah, gotcha, yeah fair
[14:21:41] <Nasp> Seems my bigint project was already .NET 6
[14:21:48] <CoderGuy> okay I got my dynamic example simplified
[14:22:02] <Suchiman> Nasp: no difference between .NET 5 and .NET 6
[14:22:07] <CoderGuy> can confirm, you can totally through dynamic set the inner array to being an array so you can do the following
[14:22:13] <maroon> Suchiman, are there likely going to be problems trying to upgrade from 4.5 to net6?
[14:22:41] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Not that it matters much, i did some prime stuff and that shit takes hours in the higher ranges like 2^132049
[14:22:59] <CoderGuy> dynamic foo = new dynamic[]{"a"};  which translates to ["a"];  you can then do this foo[0] = new dynamic[]{"a"}; which translates to [["a"]];
[14:23:44] <CoderGuy> BUT I agree this is dumb nobody should be doing this
[14:23:58] <maroon> Nasp, yeah those can be slow, but they're faster than if they were a random number of the same bitlength
[14:24:02] <Suchiman> maroon: depends (TM), at large you can just retarget and it may just work, they did deprecate a few things like appdomains, Thread.Abort, WCF and WWF but winforms and the general .NET API surface are still there
[14:24:12] <CoderGuy> dynamic nexted arrays along with implicit operators was the lesson of the day though
[14:24:16] <CoderGuy> nested*
[14:24:48] <Suchiman> maroon: they have this helper https://github.com/dotnet/upgrade-assistant
[14:25:00] <Suchiman> maroon: see also https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/upgrade-assistant-winforms-framework
[14:25:11] <CoderGuy> anyways ap5 that's the answer, you use dynamic if you want nested arrays of unknown etc, BUT you shouldn't do this, even though I did ask the question lol
[14:25:39] <maroon> the adiirc client that this plugin is running inside, it's built around net4.5, so this code might not run if compiled in newer
[14:25:43] <ap5> And i wrote that you could but shouldn't :)
[14:25:54] <CoderGuy> true
[14:25:58] <Suchiman> maroon: ah, yes, if the goal is to run it inside adiirc then you're bound by that
[14:26:04] <CoderGuy> so what's next is to find a solution outside of this whole dynamic thing
[14:26:43] <CoderGuy> to me it seems like if you have data where you're converting the internal data to other data types perhaps your data structure is a tree
[14:26:54] <maroon> Suchiman, i've been using adiirc to do a lot of stuff so i don't need to code it into the dll, like disk writes etc
[14:27:03] <Nasp> maroon: BitInts or 2^something ints?
[14:27:31] <CoderGuy> lemme map out what this looks like as a tree instead
[14:28:21] <maroon> Nasp, i mean there are shortcuts to handling primes that are 2^n +/-small, rather than random(2^n,2^n-1])
[14:29:12] <maroon> that's why the list of largest known primes are usually like x*y^n +/- small int
[14:30:00] <maroon> and y is almost always 2, though sometimes ive seen 3^n
[14:30:47] <CoderGuy> yup tree data structure works perfectly
[14:31:17] <CoderGuy> yeah so basically instead of having all these nested arrays you just have a linked list if you will in a tree setup
[14:31:39] <CoderGuy> and the linked list, can be an array of linked list, and those linked list can have there own arrays of linnked list
[14:32:10] <shadowchaser> CoderGuy sounds sane;)
[14:32:15] <CoderGuy> but this way each data type is limited to just having their "children"
[14:32:35] <CoderGuy> like nothing more, just here are your kids and we'll ask them if they have kids
[14:33:03] <CoderGuy> so instead of this [[[["a"]],[["b"]]]]
[14:33:09] <maroon> Suchiman, your gist, was that just testing how BigInteger.ModPow() ran?
[14:33:13] <CoderGuy> you have a tree link list setup to cause that
[14:33:20] <Suchiman> maroon: yep
[14:33:40] <CoderGuy> and to go further you might have this like
[14:34:31] <CoderGuy> ["a",["b",["d","f"]],["d",[[["e","f","g"],["h"]]]] as you can see it gets massive
[14:34:40] <CoderGuy> but instead of all that you just have a tree
[14:35:10] <CoderGuy> alright sorry for spamming this wonderful chat but ty for helping me explore this data type was very curious the ups & downs to it
[14:37:19] <Suchiman> maroon: not sure if you saw, i added the testcode a minute after posting the gist to the gist. Benchmark.NET runs the method attributed with [Benchmark] repeatedly to remove the one time jit overhead and get a statically relevant mean, removing outliers and such from the runs

[14:40:18] <Suchiman> maroon: btw. when you want to measure code the simple and fast way, use Stopwatch instead of DateTime, Stopwatch uses high precision counters while DateTime isn't as precise by far
[14:41:05] <maroon> is stopwatch slower code or just uses a different api?
[14:42:13] <Nasp> maroon:  Yeah i'm using those shortcuts
[14:42:18] <Nasp> it's a lot easier when they are -1
[14:42:31] <Nasp> Just fill a byte array with 0 and shift it
[14:42:52] <Nasp> But still takes ages to check
[14:43:32] <maroon> yeah, the 1st time i tested a number that was 2^n+small, yikes this is fast i must have made a horrible mistake and it's not checking right
[14:46:21] <Suchiman> maroon: it calls the windows QueryHighPerformanceCounter API which returns the monotonous clock built into the CPU
[14:46:38] <Suchiman> maroon: it's faster and more precise than DateTime
[14:47:25] <maroon> seems like i'd read something to the effect that there's a different QPC for each core, so it's remotely possible for time to go backwards
[14:47:40] <MatthiasVance> Extra fast code
[14:51:26] <Nasp> maroon: Well it's quite faster for smaller primes
[14:52:26] <Suchiman> maroon: yeah microsoft recommends to use QPC instead of using TSC directly because QPC compensates for any bugs
[14:58:05] <jmer> if <Nullable> is set to "annotations" is there even any point in doing: public string InternalInit { get; set; }  = default!;
[14:59:29] <Suchiman> jmer: the  `= default!;` part is only to suppress the warning, but if there are no warnings, then there's no point in suppressing anything that isn't there :P
[14:59:43] <jmer> Suchiman: exactly. It's super confusing
[15:00:37] <jmer> what freaks me out the most is that this code hasn'
[15:00:38] <jmer> t
[15:00:47] <jmer> seen changes for at least 12 months
[15:01:47] <jmer> I also don't get why it's necessary to explicitly assign Default, doesn't that happen if you just declare the variable?
[15:05:17] <jmer> I mean couldn't it just have been: public string? InternalInit { get; set; }
[15:05:28] <Suchiman> jmer: kinda, yeah, but if you declare a non nullable string and do not initialize it to something non null, then the compiler will warn that the non null property wasn't initialized to a non null value and may be null, you can lie to the C# compiler about having done your duty by saying `= null!;` (or default) which basically says to the compiler "assign this null which is not null" and then the compiler is happy
[15:06:39] <Suchiman> jmer: thus allowing you to declare a non null property without ensuring it has been initialized, this is handy if a property realistically is never null but by construction of the code that can't be compile time checked
[15:07:26] <Tobbi_> Morning peasants.
[15:07:35] <Suchiman> jmer: if you declare it nullable but realistically it's never null, you'll get a warning at every call site that you are possible encountering a null reference exception here
[15:07:39] <Suchiman> Tobbi_: hello pheasant
[15:08:28] <jmer> Suchiman: In this case the ctor doesn't assign these values so they will certainly be null unless you explicitly initialize them everytime you create an instance...
[15:08:48] <jmer> Suchiman: I can see how it can shut up compiler warnings...
[15:09:09] <jmer> So the warning that is being shut up by tricking this, is actually relevant imho
[15:09:17] <jmer> I don't like it when people do weird stuff just to hide warnings
[15:09:20] <Suchiman> jmer: yeah this is exactly why you would do it, there's no point in doing = null!; if the ctor assigns it :P this is mostly done with DTO's that are always initialized with object initializer syntax
[15:09:49] <jmer> Suchiman: in this case, there is no custom ctor
[15:09:58] <Suchiman> jmer: yeah that's what i'm saying
[15:10:01] <jmer> So I think it's an error to shut up these warnings.
[15:10:07] <Suchiman> jmer: or with EF for example, all the DbSet's are always initialized by EF via reflection but the compiler can't see that
[15:10:14] <jmer> yes but this isn't EF
[15:11:09] <Suchiman> jmer: yeah but what i'm saying is, in idiomatic C# you often write: class MyDto { prop1, prop2 } without ctor and always do new MyDto { prop1 = "blah", prop2 = 42 }; thus ensuring it's initialized in a way the compiler can't proof

[16:22:53] <canton7> I think if you could avoid a virus scanner by simply inverting all the bytes of your application, every virus would already be doing that...
[16:30:15] <Suchiman> canton7: on the other hand, if all the bytes are inverted, it's not a virus anymore, it's not executable and can't do harm :P
[16:31:11] <canton7> You could say the same about the viruses which apply multiple levels of encryption to their own binary...
[16:34:16] <Suchiman> canton7: yes, however they're still executable. AFAIK, anti malware uses two basic principles, signatures to find a pattern in a file and heuristics like behavioral analysis in realtime and in sandboxed trial runs

[22:18:43] <Suchiman> DevJohnC: i would expect Value to be... null
[22:19:21] <ern> is null valid value in JSON ?
[22:20:00] <Suchiman> ern: yes
[22:20:54] <ern> I remember I sent that to some swift developer (iOS) who b*thed alot
[22:21:21] <DevJohnC> Suchiman, the `CurrentState` says `PostValue` so maybe newtonsoft is weird about null handling?
[22:22:13] <Suchiman> ern: https://www.json.org/json-en.html
[22:22:32] <Suchiman> DevJohnC: hm... the thing is, the only thing i've changed is upgrading from .NET Framework 4.8 to .NET 6 lol

[22:22:49] <Suchiman> diagnosing the tests that are failing...
[22:23:03] <DevJohnC> tis strange indeed
[22:23:14] <DevJohnC> I'm curious what you discover
[22:23:42] <Suchiman> DevJohnC: but yeah... interesting tidibit with that PostValue
[22:23:44] <DevJohnC> I've always found working with json.net at the reader/writer level to be fairly hard to do
[22:24:12] <DevJohnC> either documentation on it is lacking or hard to find
[22:25:22] <Suchiman> DevJohnC: although... from the description, it kinda looks correct https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json/blob/52190a3a3de6ef9a556583cbcb2381073e7197bc/Src/Newtonsoft.Json/JsonReader.cs#L88-L91

[22:32:50] <DevJohnC> Suchiman, I assume you intend that the "AvailableUntil" token has just been read?
[22:33:44] <Suchiman> DevJohnC: well, this is a JsonConverter, so i expect that in the ReadJson method that the reader is pointing at the value to be read into the property that i've decorated with the [JsonConverter(typeof(T))] attribute which is AvailableUntil
[22:35:00] <bomb> ki9a ki9d why is your Swift compiler free, is it adware?
[22:35:10] <DevJohnC> Suchiman, can you update to a newer version and see if it fixes it?
[22:35:29] <bomb> "Compiled with Elements Compiler" prompt in the beginning or something
[22:35:46] <Suchiman> DevJohnC: no, already using 13.0.1

[22:40:41] <DevJohnC> huh
[22:42:17] <Suchiman> it gets weirder even... lol
[22:42:31] <Suchiman> lemme see if i can reproduce a minimal sample
[22:48:28] <Slade> so, shared internal libraries.  whats the simple way to do this? self host nuget? or some sorta git submodule?
[22:48:47] <Slade> tho i'm half tempted to just make it an internal rest service, and not worry about it
[22:49:48] <Suchiman> DevJohnC: https://gist.github.com/Suchiman/97cf4bd75ba0f3d80bdcf19afaee286a there you go if you wanna have a stab
[22:50:18] <Suchiman> DevJohnC: you should receive this output: Unhandled exception. Newtonsoft.Json.JsonReaderException: Could not convert string to DateTime: MaximumAccessCount. Path '[0].Options.AvailableUntil', line 1, position 55.
[22:52:32] <Suchiman> DevJohnC: also getting this with .NET FX 4.8 in my minimum reproduction, now i'm really confused
[22:54:30] <DevJohnC> so maybe a bug in 13.0.1?
[22:55:59] <ki9d> bomb: it's not adware no.
[22:56:25] <DevJohnC> give stuff away so you can charge for support :P
[22:57:57] <Suchiman> DevJohnC: at least i've figured why it's broken after the .NET 6 migration, it's sending the properties as null now vs. previously it wasn't sending them at all

[22:58:48] <DevJohnC> ahh, skip default values :p
[23:02:38] <Suchiman> DevJohnC: yeah i gotta check my NullValueHandling... i thought i had configured it correctly (applying only to a a special sort of objects and not the general API) but this is the result of one of the general APIs, never enabled that NullValueHandling for the general API because omitting props technically a breaking change

[23:40:58] <cloudbender> Question at line 14, I'm sure it relates to the socket somehow.
[23:41:00] <cloudbender> https://gist.github.com/cloudbender/f4f8cc60bb3542b81b5ce480720d9c70
[23:42:57] <jonp> cloudbender? https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.sockets.networkstream.read?view=net-6.0#system-net-sockets-networkstream-read(system-byte()-system-int32-system-int32)
[23:43:10] <jonp> > The following code example uses DataAvailable to determine if data is available to be read. If data is available, it reads from the NetworkStream.
[23:43:33] <jonp> if `stream` is a NetworkStream, you may need to use .DataAvailable before calling .Read()
[23:44:12] <cloudbender> I get the entire message on the first read
[23:44:17] <Suchiman> jonp: AFAIK stream.Read() should block if all data has been previously read and the socket is still open (able to receive new data)
[23:44:21] <jonp> otherwise, afaik stream.Read() should *block* on the 2nd call if no data is available
[23:44:41] <jonp> cloudbender: otherwise, i don't quite understand what you're asking
[23:45:00] <jonp> what does the comment mean "next stream.Read exits back to main"?
[23:45:05] <Suchiman> jonp: that Console.WriteLine(messg); didn't print anything despite him having read 16 bytes :P

[23:45:20] <cloudbender> yes
[23:45:25] <jonp> move line 21 to before 20
[23:45:44] <ki9a> wasn't there a thing with DataAvailable that it just returns the amount in the buffer ? (aka it won't ever update till you properly call Receive)?
[23:45:47] <ki9a> or read
[23:45:51] <cloudbender> ok lemme go back over those docs and try that line change
[23:45:54] <cloudbender> Thank you.
[23:46:02] <ki9a> I vaguely recall something like that
[23:46:43] <cloudbender> I did think of .Avaiable, but I'll be on a high-latency sat-link, and the chunks my be slow to arrive.
