[05:28:09] <Sapphirus> yep
[05:28:57] <Sapphirus> I'd just use something like z-wave if I wanted any sort of home automation. Zigbee sounds terrible in contrast.
[05:29:28] <Sapphirus> Then have an RPi that controls everything and connects it together.

[05:29:57] <Sapphirus> amigojapan, that's where I generally lean.
[05:30:13] <Sapphirus> To control a few lights, I just bought some Chinese RF module off of Amazon.
[05:30:27] <Sapphirus> It's about as dumb as it could possibly be.

[06:49:43] <ButterNoodle> well enough
[06:49:49] <ButterNoodle> leif84: where?
[06:50:08] <ButterNoodle> I mean I have an old refrigerator box u can live in for that
[06:50:17] <ButterNoodle> $150.. final offer
[06:50:26] <ButterNoodle> and u can use the water hose to shower
[06:50:30] <leif84> but theres only one room
[06:50:40] <ButterNoodle> are u talking about in japan?
[06:50:44] <leif84> I don't know
[06:50:52] <leif84> yes japan
[06:51:04] <leif84> I don't know if exists anymore
[06:51:07] <ButterNoodle> a livable apartment is $400 minimum
[06:51:20] <ButterNoodle> less than that ur not going to get a bathroom
[06:51:37] <ButterNoodle> $150 is sakura house prices
[06:51:47] <ButterNoodle> *verified prices as of 2019
[06:52:52] <leif84> theres a video where a boy talks about cost of living in japan
[06:53:00] <ButterNoodle> 1ldk 15 min from a station close to chyouda is gonna be 750
[06:53:06] <ButterNoodle> its not bad
[06:53:09] <ButterNoodle> for a big city
[06:53:21] <ButterNoodle> close meaning 30 min by train
[06:54:32] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: cool shit
[06:54:34] <ButterNoodle> I was gonna rent a 2ldk near kita ayase when I was planning to move there.. it was about $900 including gaijin tax
[06:54:40] <MootPoot> sorry was just making coffee
[06:54:47] <MootPoot> just saw it now
[06:54:58] <ButterNoodle> yea she tiny.. gonna put a mos on it
[06:55:07] <MootPoot> that stock looks a little wonk though
[06:55:14] <MootPoot> is that just a buffer tube with no stock
[06:55:16] <MootPoot> cant tell
[06:55:17] <ButterNoodle> *car gun - or just -CAR-
[06:55:20] <ButterNoodle> yep
[06:55:28] <ButterNoodle> no stock and thats a short tube and buffer
[06:55:36] <leif84> I didn't find
[06:55:37] <ButterNoodle> I think that one is 4"
[06:55:53] <ButterNoodle> standard pistol tubes are 6"+
[06:56:28] <ButterNoodle> they make some 2" but then u have to get a different bcg and buffer - and they are 4-500$
[06:56:53] <ButterNoodle> thats as short as I can get it before I start paying $$$$$ for miniaturization

[06:59:04] <ButterNoodle> idk 8 or 9
[06:59:07] <Fenderbassist> dang

[06:59:14] <ButterNoodle> yes
[06:59:16] <Fenderbassist> must be nice
[06:59:19] <ButterNoodle> then need to work on my toes
[06:59:20] <Fenderbassist> but, you worked hard for it
[06:59:56] <ButterNoodle> I'd like to start on AKs.. but they are a bit more to build.. and headspacing is dangerous on aks
[07:00:08] <MootPoot> I have a big pp head
[07:00:15] <MootPoot> skinny shaft though
[07:00:19] <Fenderbassist> oh good to know, I wasn't aware
[07:00:25] <ButterNoodle> yea.. making up for being poor and selling everything years ago
[07:00:30] <Fenderbassist> there was a time I was looking at getting into AKs with a Romanian as a starter
[07:00:31] <leif84> I remember what he said that him pay 750 usd in apartament
[07:00:41] <MootPoot> the only thing I regret selling was my gtx 1060
[07:00:44] <MootPoot> should have kept it
[07:00:56] <ButterNoodle> leif84: you can live in a nice place for that money.. just takes a bit of searching
[07:01:23] <ButterNoodle> Fenderbassist: only worry about headspacing when assembling.. they never need checked after built
[07:01:53] <ButterNoodle> I mean its sad that an ar can be bought for less than 1/2 of an AK these days
[07:01:54] <Fenderbassist> gotcha, I wouldn't build one cause I don't have the skills, I would buy one prebuilt but will get a NoGo gauge for them
[07:02:15] <Fenderbassist> yeah used to be the reverse and then prices got wonky with the laws
[07:02:21] <Fenderbassist> and bans
[07:02:28] <MootPoot> all I want anymore is a larger centerfire rifle
[07:02:31] <ButterNoodle> yep.. its so easy to buy ar's in parts when stuff goes on sale. then before u know it u have another one built
[07:02:34] <MootPoot> preferably semi
[07:02:43] <ButterNoodle> meh
[07:02:52] <ButterNoodle> wdym tho?

[07:24:48] <Fenderbassist> uh oh
[07:24:53] <Fenderbassist> I trust you did not hit her back
[07:25:10] <Fenderbassist> but just blocked or trapped the punches so no one got hurt
[07:25:17] <amigojapan> I hit her back in self defense Fenderbassist 
[07:25:50] <Fenderbassist> the overweight, diabetic girl that can hardly walk 
[07:26:01] <Fenderbassist> came after you like Mike Tyson?
[07:26:04] <leif84> who is tomako?
[07:26:05] <amigojapan> Yup
[07:26:08] <MootPoot> leif84: his wife
[07:26:21] <Fenderbassist> next time, don't hit back, just block until she punches herself tired
[07:26:25] <MootPoot> Fenderbassist: tbh they both dont sound very capable of hurting each other too much
[07:26:25] <Nanobot> I need to decide whether to renew my homeowners insurance. Since I don't have a mortgage anymore, I'm no longer required to have insurance. It's $760/year. 
[07:26:34] <Fenderbassist> she's not conditioned, she can last 1 minute of cardio maybe?
[07:26:45] <ButterNoodle> Nanobot: uhh
[07:26:47] <Fenderbassist> MootPoot: I sure hope not, I don't want either of them hurt
[07:26:49] <MootPoot> Nanobot: what does it insure anyways
[07:26:56] <ButterNoodle> would u have car insurance if the law didnt require it?
[07:27:00] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: can I ask what started it?
[07:27:02] <Nanobot> MootPoot: Fire damage, mainly.
[07:27:10] <amigojapan> Ok Fenderbassist but she did not let me go to sleep when I was tired. I was in a weak spot
[07:27:11] <Nanobot> ButterNoodle: No.
[07:27:19] <ButterNoodle> oof
[07:27:21] <Fenderbassist> why didn't she let you go to sleep?
[07:27:31] * ButterNoodle ups his uninsured motorist policy
[07:27:39] <Fenderbassist> ButterNoodle: I did
[07:27:41] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: I refused to go buy her snacks cause I was going to sleep
[07:27:55] <Fenderbassist> next time, take one for the team and go buy her snacks
[07:27:56] <ButterNoodle> Fenderbassist: yea mine is already at state maximums
[07:28:03] <Fenderbassist> ButterNoodle: ditto, it's getting bad out there
[07:28:19] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: I understand how you feel, but if that was all she asked for, was it so much?
[07:28:32] <Nanobot> ButterNoodle: You do realize that insurance doesn't cause money to appear out of thin air, right? Most people never get as much out of insurance as they pay in. If they did, insurance companies wouldn't be profitable.
[07:28:37] <Fenderbassist> it's a pain in the ass, but it's a tradeoff
[07:28:37] <amigojapan> Ok Fenderbassist but don't forget my medicine makes me sleepy. It's not an easy task
[07:28:41] <Fenderbassist> oh I know
[07:28:43] <Fenderbassist> I relate
[07:28:58] <Fenderbassist> I'm sick and wanted to stay in bed all day today
[07:28:59] <ButterNoodle> after getting ran over by a taxi on the motorcycle.. and finding out most companies only have an obscenely small amount of required coverage
[07:29:02] <ButterNoodle> I upped mine
[07:29:04] <Fenderbassist> but I had to do a 3 hour round trip for the family
[07:29:16] <Fenderbassist> you sometimes take one for the team
[07:29:19] <ButterNoodle> Nanobot: I got 100K out of getting ran over
[07:29:34] <amigojapan> I see Fenderbassist 
[07:29:41] <ButterNoodle> I'll never pay that into insurance
[07:29:49] <Fenderbassist> it wasn't going to kill me, so I knew I would survive :)
[07:30:02] <Nanobot> ButterNoodle: It sounds like the insurance saved you from having to file a lawsuit.
[07:30:04] <MootPoot> sometimes I masturbate while driving
[07:30:11] <ButterNoodle> and I've been hit a few times in the car.. not my fault - their insurance paid
[07:30:23] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: she is still mad today
[07:30:25] <ButterNoodle> Nanobot: I did have to file to get it
[07:30:53] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: whatcha gonna do to smooth things out?
[07:31:14] <Fenderbassist> I assume she will not just up and apologize for her over reaction
[07:31:17] <leif84> calm down everybody
[07:31:28] <Fenderbassist> so I guess it's up to you to put on the Adult Hat
[07:31:31] <ButterNoodle> if I didnt stick to my own PT plans I would still be in bad shape, and 100K wouldnt even touch "my pain and suffering" as I say in a whiney voice
[07:31:49] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: I think just wait until she calms down. I need to go to immigration today anyway
[07:31:51] <Fenderbassist> leif84: is someone upset?
[07:31:55] <ButterNoodle> I can see how people get these huge lawsuits over pain and suffering
[07:32:09] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: ok I hope things do chill
[07:32:13] <leif84> Fenderbassist, why?
[07:32:21] <Fenderbassist> leif84: "calm down everybody"
[07:32:24] <leif84> because I said calm down
[07:32:26] <Fenderbassist> yes
[07:32:30] <ButterNoodle> Nanobot: and insurance fixed my stupidity 2x.. I had a refrigerator fall on my mustang.. on 2 different occasions
[07:32:38] <ButterNoodle> they paid to fix it on both accounts
[07:32:50] <amigojapan> Ty Fenderbassist

[07:33:12] <Nanobot> ButterNoodle: How much do you pay for insurance?
[07:33:23] <ButterNoodle> *my rates didnt go up.. so that tells me I am being over charged
[07:33:33] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: I have found that when you live with someone, little requests like that one are better off carried out than things escalating like they did, I hope it doesn't happen agin
[07:33:36] <Fenderbassist> again*
[07:33:50] <ButterNoodle> for 2 motorcycles 2 cars and 2 trailers.. not counting the house about 150$ a month?

[07:33:55] <Fenderbassist> ButterNoodle: unless you've earned accident forgiveness
[07:34:00] <amigojapan> I see Fenderbassist 
[07:34:09] <Nanobot> I pay around $600/year for car insurance, and I've never gotten one cent out of it.
[07:34:12] <ButterNoodle> I have 0$ deductible on comp
[07:34:26] <ButterNoodle> 1K on collision bc I will sue whoever hits me for that
[07:34:39] <ButterNoodle> Nanobot: ur lucky
[07:34:49] <ButterNoodle> some would say its a waste
[07:34:58] <ButterNoodle> others would say ur lucky u didnt have to use it
[07:35:04] <Nanobot> I don't think my car is ever worth $600 anymore.
[07:35:07] <Nanobot> *even
[07:35:14] <ButterNoodle> ask Satin about her woes w insurance
[07:35:27] <ButterNoodle> well thats a different story..
[07:35:34] <MootPoot> I'm top level here
[07:35:39] <MootPoot> I dont have a car
[07:35:44] <MootPoot> lol
[07:35:50] <MootPoot> or any vehicle
[07:36:02] <ButterNoodle> if I was still driving my 1987 ford escort... I shouldnt have to pay more than a few hundred dollars to cover someone elses losses
[07:36:04] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: I am sorry it happened man
[07:36:08] <Fenderbassist> doesn't sound fun 
[07:36:12] <ButterNoodle> *per year
[07:36:19] <Nanobot> But my point is that insurance is an expected loss. Overall, the people who pay into insurance *must* get less out of it than they pay in, or it wouldn't be sustainable. Not only is it sustainable, it's highly profitable for the insurance companies. We're all getting screwed.
[07:36:26] <amigojapan> It was not Fenderbassist 
[07:36:41] <MootPoot> I wanna get screwed by a cute girl insurance company
[07:36:53] * MootPoot spreads
[07:36:54] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: I would have taken it as a Wake Up Call from Reality saying "it's time to change your ways", if it was me
[07:36:57] <ButterNoodle> u do realize that insurance companies take the billions we give them and invest it
[07:37:06] <ButterNoodle> probably some in crypto
[07:37:13] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: can they invest it in my cheeks
[07:37:16] <MootPoot> rather then pulling out
[07:37:20] <ButterNoodle> some in real high risk hedge fund garbage
[07:37:35] <ButterNoodle> and some in betting on their own failure
[07:38:24] <ButterNoodle> no insurance company is sittin on a huge stack of cash like uncle scrooge 
[07:38:41] <ButterNoodle> but yea they are betting on u never using it
[07:38:50] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: imho she was completely in the wrong, but since she got to that point it would have made me take a long hard look at what I was doing
[07:38:52] <ButterNoodle> *cost of owing property
[07:39:03] <ButterNoodle> owning*
[07:39:15] <MootPoot> insruance is about as much of a ripoff as american healthcare really
[07:39:23] <ButterNoodle> yes
[07:39:30] <ButterNoodle> its all a ripoff till you need it
[07:39:36] <Fenderbassist> ^
[07:39:36] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: I was chatting
[07:39:41] <Fenderbassist> no I mean in general
[07:39:49] <MootPoot> well, I don't mind insurnace
[07:39:59] <Fenderbassist> "I got a woman so angry that she attacked me like a boxer, what is it that I'm doing lately that lead up to this?
[07:40:01] <Fenderbassist> "
[07:40:07] <MootPoot> I just think mandated insurance ( like for cars ) should have a state owned non profit option
[07:40:16] <Fenderbassist> I'd at least look
[07:40:29] <MootPoot> mandating it using laws then making you buy it....
[07:40:34] <MootPoot> from a private corp
[07:40:38] <leif84> Fenderbassist, I read that theres a guy wanting buy a grenade
[07:40:38] <ButterNoodle> hmm
[07:40:42] <ButterNoodle> mandating things...
[07:40:47] <Fenderbassist> leif84: smoke grenade
[07:40:50] <Fenderbassist> not explosive
[07:40:56] <Fenderbassist> just makes lots of smoke
[07:40:57] <ButterNoodle> can agree
[07:40:59] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: you need to have insurance to drive in the US right?
[07:41:00] <jessedesu_onaph> Womandating
[07:41:04] <ButterNoodle> would like the option to not have to
[07:41:07] <ButterNoodle> yes
[07:41:09] <MootPoot> yeah
[07:41:25] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: she was hungry and she could not go to the shop on her own. That's what she said
[07:41:29] <Nanobot> I found out what was making the popping/static sounds in my brand new sound system. It's my smartphone. When it's plugged in, it seems to draw too much power or something can messes with my other electronics. Yet another reason I should get rid of my smartphone.
[07:41:30] <ButterNoodle> at the same time.. would like the option to have enough insurance to cover myself if they dont have any
[07:41:36] <MootPoot> that's my problem...effectivly its govt and private in cahoots....you HAVE to pay this otherwise you lose your car
[07:41:43] <Nanobot> s/can/and/
[07:41:45] <ButterNoodle> Nanobot: put it in the blender
[07:41:48] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: yeah that's why I suggested just doing it
[07:42:11] <MootPoot> Nanobot: plug in as in charge?
[07:42:12] <ButterNoodle> it may be the wall wart.. most have shitty switching inside and make a lot of RF noise
[07:42:14] <Fenderbassist> anyways, I hope things get better between you two
[07:42:19] <Nanobot> MootPoot: Yeah
[07:42:25] <ButterNoodle> shit charger
[07:42:28] <MootPoot> *
[07:42:29] <amigojapan> Alright I will in the future Fenderbassist 
[07:42:33] <MootPoot> what butter said
[07:42:35] <Fenderbassist> it will be better for you
[07:42:36] <ButterNoodle> can not recommend a good one tho
[07:42:36] <Fenderbassist> I think
[07:42:44] <MootPoot> Nanobot: sounds like a shit charger problem
[07:42:48] <ButterNoodle> they are all made in china.. probably in the same factory
[07:42:59] <Nanobot> It's the charger the phone came with. It's a Google Pixel 2, and it's garbage. The screen is all warped, even though it just sits on a desk all the time.
[07:43:02] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: I have a friend guitarist who was a little like that lately with me
[07:43:18] <MootPoot> Nanobot: anker and Ugreen have never done me wrong
[07:43:25] <MootPoot> if you are willing to get a new charger
[07:43:42] <ButterNoodle> Fenderbassist: did u choke the lil shit :O
[07:43:48] <Nanobot> I actually have two different chargers, and it does the same thing with both.
[07:43:49] <amigojapan> I see Fenderbassist 
[07:44:08] <leif84> I though nanobot is bot(?)
[07:44:15] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: she wants me to meet with her band, I was super busy at the time and couldn't do it right away....she didn't like that and said so....I could have easily used that as excuse to blow her off but then after a few minutes I decided I could make the time
[07:44:19] <Nanobot> I think it's the phone itself. It also loses its charge super fast when it isn't plugged in. It might last a couple of hours doing nothing.
[07:44:24] <ButterNoodle> reminds me of my uncles last words.. 
[07:44:35] <Fenderbassist> ButterNoodle: nah, I gave her understanding and it almost floored her
[07:44:37] <ButterNoodle> he said stop shaking the ladder u lil fucker
[07:44:46] <MootPoot> Nanobot: I mean in smartphone years 2017 is like prehistoric
[07:45:04] <Nanobot> Well, my next phone will probably be a feature phone.
[07:45:05] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: I still have a note 9
[07:45:08] <ButterNoodle> its fine
[07:45:13] <ButterNoodle> still sends dick pics
[07:45:16] <Nanobot> I just need phone calls and texting.
[07:45:22] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: it was inconvenient but again she lives 10 minutes away, so went through with it
[07:45:24] <amigojapan> I see Fenderbassist 
[07:45:27] * ButterNoodle hands Nanobot a flip phone
[07:45:27] <MootPoot> the little rectangles arent really built to last more then 2 years really
[07:45:32] <MootPoot> anything more then that is luck
[07:45:46] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: with family, friends, work mates, you sometimes gotta make a little sacrifice to keep things goin
[07:45:49] <Fenderbassist> going*
[07:45:54] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: yea thats about right.. my wife gets burn in on the screen in that amount of time
[07:45:58] <Fenderbassist> especially if you have a good reputation
[07:46:00] <ButterNoodle> I use arch
[07:46:04] <ButterNoodle> not a smartphone
[07:46:52] <MootPoot> Lipo batteries last about 500 or so cycles 
[07:46:57] <MootPoot> Afaik 
[07:46:59] <ButterNoodle> yep
[07:47:02] <ButterNoodle> thats what kills em
[07:47:03] <MootPoot> If you charge once a day 
[07:47:09] <MootPoot> Over two years. 
[07:47:22] <ButterNoodle> I think its also how hard u discharge too
[07:47:45] <MootPoot> Micro cycles help though, mine is still doing well Becuase I have wireless charging pads on all my desks 
[07:47:50] <ButterNoodle> my note 9 rarely goes below 70% and its still going strong..
[07:47:54] <MootPoot> So the battery gets maintained 
[07:48:13] <ButterNoodle> my wifes gets ran all the way down and its in shit shape
[07:48:22] <ButterNoodle> *daily
[07:48:26] <MootPoot> My v60 is turning into a laggy pos for some reason though 
[07:48:35] <MootPoot> Considering just doing a factory reset 
[07:48:36] <ButterNoodle> u got russian spyware on it
[07:48:46] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: better then American spyware 
[07:49:03] <MootPoot> Least they can't do anything to me for the most part 
[07:49:05] <ButterNoodle> yea america has nothing I want
[07:49:41] <ButterNoodle> *free russian singles directly to ur smartphone - only 1.99 for the first min - 7.99 for each additional
[07:49:57] <MootPoot> Why are phone lines so expensive 
[07:50:09] <MootPoot> Tbh I'd pay for one if it was like 20 an hour 
[07:50:17] <MootPoot> Not 5 bucks a minute 
[07:51:45] <MootPoot> I've been wanting to factory reset my phone to deal with all the glitches but 
[07:51:47] <Fenderbassist> great Talieson Jaffe quote: "At my uncle's funeral, I suddenly realized as a kid that I'm gonna end one day, this is gonna be over and there's no guarantees about what the rest of this life is going to be, if anything at all...I'm amazed that anyone can not have that realization and not immediately delve into deep levels of compassion and pity for the rest of mankind, cause this is a shit deal"
[07:52:02] <MootPoot> It's gonna be a pain to reinstall everything 
[07:52:58] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: tomako is now messaging me that she got some cuts from my nails being long
[07:53:38] <MootPoot> although to LG's credit - this is the first phone I've had that lasted longer then 2 years with no major issues
[07:53:39] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: although she started it all, be the man and apologize (knowing you were reacting to her actions) and bring her some treats when you go home....it's not always fair but it's a good way to settle things
[07:54:12] <Fenderbassist> better to be at peace than to be "right" over an argument about snacks
[07:54:26] <Fenderbassist> if that's all this is about
[07:54:41] <Fenderbassist> so you can sleep at night
[07:55:12] <amigojapan> Alright Fenderbassist I will do that

[07:57:55] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: a relative of mine got in trouble with her car and needed my help....(cover your ears Butter)....and I had to sell half my firearms collection to bail her out....sometimes you just gotta take it on the chin :)
[07:58:48] <Fenderbassist> a catalytic converter and fuel pump later....everything is back to "normal"
[07:59:08] <MootPoot> why is normal in quotes
[07:59:28] <Fenderbassist> because you never know what Life will pop on you tomorrow
[07:59:36] <Fenderbassist> that's why you do what you can do to get a peaceful night's sleep prior
[07:59:44] <MootPoot> aaah
[07:59:47] <Fenderbassist> in this crazy world
[07:59:48] <MootPoot> I want that UPS but
[08:00:03] <MootPoot> I dont wanna spend 200 bucks on a non-essencial when no job
[08:00:16] <Fenderbassist> add it to your wish list and apply for 5 more jobs
[08:00:26] <Fenderbassist> I always maintained a wish list, even pre-computer days
[08:00:31] <Fenderbassist> is motivation
[08:00:53] <MootPoot> tbh I have litearlly everything I could want aside from maybe 2-3 more things
[08:01:07] <Fenderbassist> do you wish to keep them all?
[08:01:28] <MootPoot> what is them
[08:01:30] <Fenderbassist> or would you not be heartbroken to sell them over time to pay bills?
[08:01:44] <Fenderbassist> them = everything I could want
[08:01:47] <MootPoot> ah
[08:01:56] <Fenderbassist> think of it as reverse motivation lol
[08:01:57] <MootPoot> yeah, I wouldn't want to sell them
[08:02:53] <Fenderbassist> though tbh you will never see a UHaul behind a Hearse, you can't take anything with you at the end so we ultimately cannot keep anything permanently
[08:03:03] <Fenderbassist> but it would be nice for you to keep them for decades
[08:03:34] <MootPoot> the only things I want atm are 1.) paid off place to live ( long term goal ) 2.) cheap motorcycle 3.) cute girl 4.) maybe some odds and ends
[08:03:44] <MootPoot> but overall in terms of material goods I'm pretty satisfied
[08:03:50] <Fenderbassist> that's good
[08:03:54] <Fenderbassist> you will succeed
[08:04:06] <Fenderbassist> all you need is work and you will accomplish all that
[08:04:10] <MootPoot> mmm
[08:04:12] <Fenderbassist> over time

[08:05:33] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: and how did you respond?
[08:06:05] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: I said it will not happen again
[08:06:21] <MootPoot> tbh it might actually be better if she goes for a while
[08:06:34] <MootPoot> you two can calm down seperately
[08:06:51] <MootPoot> and she can figure out how other people won't really deal with her crap in the same way that amigo does
[08:07:02] <Fenderbassist> there's something to be said for that
[08:07:23] <MootPoot> sometimes we all need a reality check
[08:07:24] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: now she is saying she is happy cause of she goes to a shelter she can easily get divorced
[08:07:39] <MootPoot> just let her imo - she'll come crawling back
[08:07:59] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: what do you think?
[08:08:16] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: is this the end of the line?
[08:08:18] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: I don't want to get divorced
[08:08:37] <Fenderbassist> ah ok
[08:08:40] <MootPoot> Fenderbassist: sounds like she's bluffing....if she wanted to get divorced she would have done it already 
[08:08:49] <Fenderbassist> I really don't know
[08:08:53] <Fenderbassist> I don't have enough info
[08:08:55] <MootPoot> what's the point of telling him that if she was going to get a divorce
[08:09:19] <Fenderbassist> well in my experience, words are their weapons of choice whereas fists were ours
[08:09:32] <Fenderbassist> so I never take lightly the words of an angry woman
[08:09:54] <MootPoot> sure
[08:10:00] <MootPoot> I guess only amigo can decide

[08:15:26] <jessedesu_onaph> Something to think about

[16:28:10] <name100> amigojapan what's up
[16:28:54] <DunceCotus> this is why everyone goes on about "its March already" or as in PancakeMatsuri, we seem to be able to pack less into each day
[16:28:58] <amigojapan> Hi name100 no good today :(
[16:29:03] <DunceCotus> its a matter of contraction of time
[16:29:46] <amigojapan> Hey DunceCotus 
[16:30:02] <DunceCotus> hey amigojapan 
[16:30:05] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I only do one big thing a day
[16:30:22] <DunceCotus> days used to be quite long
[16:30:33] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: me too
[16:30:42] <DunceCotus> and its not an aging thing either
[16:30:47] <DunceCotus> this seems universal
[16:31:17] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: you were just young, that is a known condition "time dilation"
[16:31:37] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: young people are also talking about this though
[16:32:06] <amigojapan> It's not universal, to kids now time still goes by slowly 
[16:32:26] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: well I claim not as slowly as kids used to perceive time
[16:32:39] <name100> the timeless moments 
[16:33:19] <DunceCotus> I think we must be approaching some Event
[16:33:30] <DunceCotus> that possibly affects time as such

[16:52:39] <amigojapan> No DunceCotus that Is also something that changes coastlines have infinite length, they are fractals, and the finer they define it the more it changes, but what is the point in me correcting your ideas when you always just dismisses any other explanation?
[16:54:05] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: that would explain current maps, yes, but not a screenshot of the map from 2016
[16:54:13] <DunceCotus> that screenshot shouldn't have changed, but it did :/
[16:54:59] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: yeah I know I can be a hard arse about this, but people go on about proof and I think this may be one way of acquiring it

[18:45:33] <bxgelsan> DunceCotus, hypothetically you are given the gift thats a curse which allows you to manipulate the chess board with great skill.
[18:45:42] <bxgelsan> manipulators use monkeys paws
[18:45:49] <bxgelsan> xD
[18:45:55] <amigojapan> See you tomorrow and thank you DunceCotus and Jesse

[18:46:11] <DunceCotus> bxgelsan: ok?
[18:47:07] <bxgelsan> DunceCotus, In a chess board you are in control of the monkeys.
[18:47:13] <bxgelsan> Sergeant-Major Morris, a friend who served with the British Army in India, comes by for dinner and introduces them to a mummified monkey's paw. An old fakir placed a spell on the paw, so that it would grant three wishes but only with hellish consequences as punishment for tampering with fate.
[18:47:17] <bxgelsan> it comes from a story
[18:47:42] <bxgelsan> cautionary tale of what happens when you play god :)
[18:47:55] <bxgelsan> nothing works out in the end.
[18:48:59] <JesseDesu> those sneaky fakirs
[18:49:07] <DunceCotus> bxgelsan: Im struggling to see the connection with chess
[18:49:52] <DunceCotus> bxgelsan: control of the monkeys.. doesn't work out for you the players or the monkeys? Both?
[18:50:07] <bxgelsan> DunceCotus, sparknotes:
[18:50:08] <bxgelsan> Chess. Chess symbolizes life in “The Monkey's Paw.” Those who play a daring, risky game of chess, for example, will lose, just as those who take unnecessary risks in life will die. When the story opens, Mr. White and Herbert play chess by the fire, and the game's outcome mirrors the story's outcome.
[18:50:42] <bxgelsan> DunceCotus, its a short story, theres an audiobook on youtube or anywhere else on the internet
[18:50:51] <DunceCotus> bxgelsan: ah right
[18:51:05] <JesseDesu> chess nuts roasting on an open fire
[18:51:07] <bxgelsan> but i think that better explains it than I was.
[18:51:27] <JesseDesu> jackfrost nipping at your ****
[18:51:38] <DunceCotus> well that may be because of an inherently hostile ground (of the chess board but also broadly of the social sphere, the battleground, the congress etc.)
[18:52:00] <DunceCotus> nature as inherently hostile ground, same with culture
[18:52:38] <DunceCotus> its hostility for 'progress'
[18:52:49] <DunceCotus> kill your darlings, tough love etc.
[18:53:28] <bxgelsan> DunceCotus, I played chess with a very intelligent and dangerous manipulator. He didn't have to cheat but at the time I had a lot worse cognition. The games were tense. Considering he wanted to kill me. Also if we got to a point where it seems like there is no end hed say you never stop a game you start.
[18:53:37] <DunceCotus> bxgelsan: I think a lot of these games, like capitalism, are more about repeated variations of playing, cylically, the game
[18:53:40] <bxgelsan> so as my cognition improved, so did my chess skills.
[18:53:43] <DunceCotus> *cyclically
[18:53:51] <bxgelsan> ( played it off and on since middle school )

[18:56:03] <DunceCotus> we're all happy magical auto-producing synthoids
[18:56:11] <bxgelsan> he used slight of hand to cheat. I knew the entire time. Once I improved I started using actual openings and strating
[18:56:27] <bxgelsan> also we did the fast chess, not where you sit and think. I dont do well with that.
[18:56:40] <bxgelsan> ( fast )
[18:56:44] <DunceCotus> bxgelsan: hmm I see
[18:56:56] <DunceCotus> bxgelsan: well cheating can also be part of the game (unwritten rules of the game)
[18:57:10] <DunceCotus> but yeah it really depends on the assemblage, who's playing the game etc.
[18:57:30] <bxgelsan> DunceCotus, oh, of course. if you are playing with a person who cant hear or see well at the time or think properly. and are a shithead.
[18:57:35] <bxgelsan> they will take full advantage.
[18:57:38] <DunceCotus> what happens when you put person X with person N etc.
[18:58:00] <bxgelsan> its the game :p
[18:58:21] <DunceCotus> bxgelsan: now blow this up to other aspects of life
[18:58:39] <DunceCotus> its the game to cheat your fellow workers for advantage..
[18:58:51] <DunceCotus> or to become capitalist and just cheat everyone all the time
[18:59:52] <DunceCotus> that's why I say these games are kinda archetypal
[19:00:04] <bxgelsan> DunceCotus, are we gonna start talking about the laws of power and other such things now?
[19:00:04] <bxgelsan> I found out about that book there. It has potential abuse applications.
[19:00:04] <bxgelsan> But interesting read.
[19:00:26] <bxgelsan> well aware.
[19:00:40] <DunceCotus> laws implies power

[19:11:23] <DunceCotus> bxgelsan: the playing cards represent a kind of repetition, but of difference, the same collection of suits can be interpreted in many ways

[19:17:28] <DunceCotus> that is to say a fixation on the past new vs. present new
[19:18:09] <DunceCotus> bxgelsan: differences in potentials
[19:19:02] <DunceCotus> like the future in the early 1900s looks very different from the future in the 1990s looks very different from the future in the 2020s etc. and not simply because of the passage of time, its more like potentialities change

[23:21:14] <Bco1981> What are unholy Panda switches? 
[23:21:15] <Bco1981> These are built from the leftovers that typically get tossed away from making Holy Pandas…. until one day someone realized that they were still GREAT LINEAR SWITCHES!

[23:22:06] <Bco1981> MootPoot: these vtuber girls gonna outnerd you ?
[23:22:13] <MootPoot> they already have

[23:26:21] <BillyZane> MootPoot, i got a 34" monitor, and i got a $1000 headphone setup
[23:26:46] <BillyZane> having a high-end keyboard/mouse would be my next upgrade
[23:27:21] <klaxa> i've had a projector since 2013, in the old flat it would project too 130" in here it's a tiny 66"
[23:27:34] <BillyZane> klaxa, wow that's nice
[23:27:54] <klaxa> it really is, next year i'll have it for 10 years
[23:27:56] <BillyZane> klaxa, what aspect radio can you project?
[23:28:14] <klaxa> 16:9 not sure it does anything else properly but i never tried
[23:28:26] <klaxa> otherwise you can of course have black bars projected
[23:28:38] <BillyZane> i really love 21:9, there are 32:9 monitors that people can't go back from

[23:29:34] <klaxa> > Discontinued December 2012 
[23:29:35] <klaxa> yeah
[23:29:45] <klaxa> but i got it in 2013 even got a replacement bulb in 2017
[23:29:51] <BillyZane> klaxa, that would have been amazing for it's time
[23:30:01] <BillyZane> klaxa, what do you think about projection on curved surfaces?
[23:30:01] <MootPoot> BillyZane: I already have all of that
[23:30:10] <BillyZane> MootPoot, nice
[23:30:12] <MootPoot> I just dont care enough to make my own keyboard 
[23:30:20] <BillyZane> MootPoot, i want to make my own keyboard too
[23:30:23] <MootPoot> I'll buy nice ones but 
[23:30:40] <MootPoot> Making your own is a lot of effort for not much gain 
[23:30:48] <BillyZane> i have specific needs
[23:30:49] <klaxa> curved surfaces venture into the domain of projection mapping and that shit is dope as hell
[23:31:02] <MootPoot> Like, I'd rather spend the money on other hobbies 
[23:31:13] <BillyZane> MootPoot, i want a split keyboard, but almost every split keyboard out there places b on the left side, when i use my right hand to actuate b
[23:31:22] <klaxa> i'm looking forward to these short distance projectors that you can put against the wall they are projecting at
[23:31:28] <klaxa> like, for them to become affordable
[23:31:53] <klaxa> but i'll replace bulbs in my current one until there are no more to buy or it's no longer ecologically viable
[23:34:23] <BillyZane> klaxa, i'm really big on image quality, specifically high contrast ratio
[23:35:11] <klaxa> for that i think LED is the future
[23:35:13] <BillyZane> OLED is where it's at, but for monitors, i like VA panels
[23:35:49] <ezekielnoob> LEDDD
[23:36:03] <Poeticode> i'm all about pure darkness. Destroy anything that emits light and hide in a faraday cage
[23:36:31] <ezekielnoob> BillyZane do you know any 21:9 monitors that are more than 40 inches
[23:36:39] <BillyZane> IPS displays, no matter how good, max out at 1000:1 contrast ratio. the VA panel I got is 3000:1, which is pretty significant. it's not as good as OLED in darkness, but it can very dark
[23:36:40] <ezekielnoob> cause usually when they go beyond 38" they become 32:9
[23:36:58] <BillyZane> ezekielnoob, not really to be honest, i think they make 38" ones
[23:37:20] <ezekielnoob> yeh those are the biggest ones they make, i kinda like the odyssey G9 but 32:9 is too "skinny" for nme
[23:37:25] <ezekielnoob> it has to sit really close to my face
[23:37:42] <BillyZane> ezekielnoob, i suggest a VA panel over IPS if you're getting one, they have higher refresh rates over IPS as well
[23:38:03] <ezekielnoob> i don't really game much BillyZane although i think VA is good enough for photo editing
[23:38:25] <ezekielnoob> i currently have a triple monitor setup, and i feel like for my programming work 1 ultrawide could be a downgrade
[23:38:39] <BillyZane> when I look at IPS displays now, it looks washed out

[23:39:18] <BillyZane> ezekielnoob, it probably would be
[23:39:31] <BillyZane> ezekielnoob, i got a single monitor, but i'm looking to upgrade
[23:39:50] <ezekielnoob> i think 2 monitors would be good for me, 1 UWA that is 21:9 and 1 vertical
[23:39:54] <BillyZane> i'll need a new desk,chair, and do the triple monitor +1 television
[23:39:58] <ezekielnoob> i just like having that extra vertical monitor
[23:41:02] <BillyZane> i really need an extra monitor
[23:41:10] <ezekielnoob> wats ur current setup
[23:41:30] <ezekielnoob> i feel like if iupgrade my monitor, that my GTX 1080 is not enough no more
[23:41:46] <BillyZane> i have an nixeus EDG34, which when i bought it, was the best monitor in my opinion for the price

[23:45:06] <BillyZane> if you look at adv and disadvantages of IPS versus VA, the area where IPS shines is with viewing angles, but that makes little sense on a monitor. trading view angles for higher contrast is a good trade
[23:45:42] <BillyZane> it's nearly as dark as an OLED display, but with no burn-in issues
[23:45:58] <BillyZane> the only real downside is that VA will still suffer from backlight bleeding
[23:46:19] <BillyZane> but that isn't as big of an issue as with IPS
