[02:51:09] <Blondie101010> don't know your case, but keep it simple
[02:51:12] <xayto>  /quit
[02:51:20] <vancz> one of them is: the standard streams have two ends, bash has one end, and the process has the other end
[02:51:40] <vancz> so to visualize whats connected to what you can draw 2x3 columns and draw lines between them
[02:51:55] <vancz> is that reasonable?

[02:55:35] <vancz> right, in theory, i have some idea of how fds work but apparently not eough
[02:55:37] <vancz> *enough
[02:55:49] <Blondie101010> they are created sequentially
[02:56:04] <vancz> open gives you a number and then you use libc to read() and write() from them and libc calls the appropriate syscalls or whatever

[02:56:28] <Blondie101010> bash does all that
[02:56:37] <vancz> there's an FD number somewhere in there that gets passed as the system call argument

[03:04:48] <Blondie101010> the first part is wrong
[03:04:55] <vancz> phrasing
[03:04:58] <vancz> its hard to talk about
[03:05:29] <vancz> 1>&2 means duplicate the file descriptor 2 to 1
[03:05:47] <vancz> so the data going to 1 ends up in 2
[03:05:58] <vancz> but note i deliberately didnt call 1 a file descriptor
[03:06:16] <vancz> is 1 a "slot for a file descriptor" or an actual file descriptor?
[03:06:32] <Celmor[m]> how would I access a specific argument by index, something like $3 where 3 would be in $index (not like $$4 is gonna work)?
[03:06:37] <vancz> is 2 an actual file descriptor, or a slot for a file descritor which currently happens to have the value 2?

[04:31:19] <Lebela> kurahaupo, I love this bot :)

[04:31:27] <Lebela> thank you
[04:31:37] <Lebela> so, I go with !=
[04:31:59] <Lebela> different question:  Does bash have a syntax similar to Perl or even PHP  with  ? :
[04:32:02] <kurahaupo> Lebela: Use (( x == y )) if you want numeric comparison, or [[ $x = y ]] if you want string comparison. Avoid -eq and -ne
[04:32:22] <Lebela> e.g. in php:   $foo = ($i < 10) ? '1' : $bar;
[04:32:40] <Lebela> means:  if the statement inside () is true,  assign the number 1,  otherwise the variable $bar
[04:32:43] <kurahaupo> Lebela: Perl stole half its syntax from the shell, so that'd be "yes". But you have to guess which half
[04:33:11] <wiscii> ha!

[05:38:50] <kurahaupo> It's kinda a pain that redirection can go anywhere in a simply command, including at the front, but you can't put them in front of compound statements.
[05:39:03] <vancz> kurahaupo: can it go at the front?

[05:39:19] <vancz> because then this needs to be fixed https://guide.bash.academy/commands/

[05:40:09] <vancz> or its just an approximation, but it doesnt feel like it from what ive read so far

[05:40:14] <vancz> ` [ var=value ... ] name [ arg ... ] [ redirection ... ]`

[05:46:05] <kurahaupo> vancz: the behaviour is "obvious" if you start by looking at the parsing phases, where it says that certain things are looked for and removed or replaced in each phase. The phase where redirections are done doesn't say they have to be at the end, therefore they can be anywhere. However definitions of compound commands *do* require their initial keywords to be at the start, which is why redirections and assignments cannot go before them
[05:46:41] <vancz> since oyu mention removed, i imagine it parses out the redirection and then removes it
[05:46:54] <vancz> so that means any later passes dont care about it

So it's not only the Shell pages that are broken, the entire documentation project has atrophied.

[08:18:51] <wiscii> space / tab .. huh .. heredocs don't care
[08:18:53] <vancz> theres a bash (apparently 4?) feature where if you use <<- instead of << you can indent a heredoc with tabs
[08:19:16] <wiscii> oh right
[08:19:16] <vancz> normally the delimiter has to be on column 0 (or how do I say this)

[08:29:35] <e36freak> but make var contain cmd's stderr, not stdout
[08:29:42] <e36freak> and stdout should still be on stdout when it's done

[10:30:28] <greybot> jq is a flexible and lightweight JSON processor: http://stedolan.github.com/jq/ . See #jq. Also, query JSON data with jshon: http://kmkeen.com/jshon/
[10:32:11] <loganlee[gnu]> # jq -n '"hello"'
[10:32:13] <shbot> loganlee[gnu]: "hello"
[10:32:17] <loganlee[gnu]> omg
[10:32:36] <loganlee[gnu]> it's so fussy
[10:32:53] <Blondie101010> it's not
[10:33:03] <Blondie101010> the string needs to include quotes
[10:33:10] <loganlee[gnu]> yep
[10:33:16] <Blondie101010> if you just quote the parameter, the shell won't pass it
[10:33:20] <pj> interesting, the jq man page says it can parse bareword keys.
[10:33:36] <pj> but that web page seems to not want to.
[10:35:04] <pj> jq . <<<'{a:"a", b:"b"}'
[10:35:11] <pj> # jq . <<<'{a:"a", b:"b"}'
[10:35:12] <shbot> pj: jq: parse error: Invalid numeric literal at line 1, column 3
[10:35:22] <pj> # jq . <<<'{"a":"a", "b":"b"}'
[10:35:24] <shbot> pj: {"a":"a","b":"b"}
[10:36:05] <pj> man jq | grep -F identifier-like
[10:36:09] <pj> # man jq | grep -F identifier-like
[10:36:11] <shbot> pj: bash: man: command not found
[10:36:14] <pj> bleh
[10:36:30] <pj> If the keys are "identifier-like", then the quotes can be left off, as in {a:42, b:17}.
[10:36:36] <Blondie101010> a) you can run these tests on your own machine; b) you can talk to shbot in private
[10:36:39] <pj> so that would seem to contradict the man page.
[10:36:54] <Blondie101010> what
[10:37:32] <pj> That sentence in the man page indicates the jq parser will accept bareword keys, but when you try it jq errors out unless the keys are quoted.
[10:37:42] *** Joins: joilerv (~joilerv@135.129.250.144)

[10:45:01] <pj> Blondie101010: jq(1) look under the section "Object Construction: {}"
[10:45:11] <pj> 2nd paragraph
[10:45:32] <pj> note the example there: {a:42, b:17}
[10:45:45] <pj> # jq . <<<'{a:42, b:17}'
[10:45:46] <shbot> pj: jq: parse error: Invalid numeric literal at line 1, column 3
[10:46:00] <pj> but if you quote the keys it works.
[10:46:13] <pj> # jq . <<<'{"a":42, "b":17}'
[10:46:14] <shbot> pj: {"a":42,"b":17}

[10:49:48] <Blondie101010> the simplest solution is to remove that line from the man page :)
[10:51:21] <pj> yeah
[10:51:31] <pj> I'm asking in #jq
[10:52:05] <Blondie101010> are you using a recent version?
[10:52:31] <pj> probably not, but the version in shbot seems to ahve the same issue
[10:52:34] <pj> and I
[10:52:47] <pj> and I'm using the same version that corresponds to the man page I'm reading
[10:53:02] <pj> btw, this is what I just asked in #jq right before you joined: https://paste.centos.org/view/25e95da9

[10:54:29] <pj> yeah, well I can understand it erroring out on bareword keys, because after all the JSON spec doesn't allow for them, but then the man page shouldn't explicitly say it can parse them.
[10:55:32] <Blondie101010> indeed... the doc seems wrong
[10:56:21] <Blondie101010> looking at their github is quite disappointing
[10:56:42] <pj> yeah.  Also that said, I could also understand wanting to allow them, because Javascript allows them and so it makes the parser more flexible to allow them as well.  Most JSON parsers that I've seen have a flag or switch that you can set to enable them to parse bareword keys like that.
[10:59:46] <Blondie101010> that opens a bunch of new possible errors

[11:01:39] <pj> at a guess underscore would be allowed
[11:02:03] <pj> but other chars that represent operators would not.
[11:02:15] <pj> ...unless quoted, that is.
[11:02:23] <Blondie101010> no release since 2018, and they have loads of open issues

[11:57:22] <emanuele6> that is the object constructor...
[11:57:50] <emanuele6> it's jq syntax not how jq parses its input

[12:00:15] <emanuele6> so why expect jq syntax in the input to be evaluated?
[12:01:00] <emanuele6> # jq -n '{a:"a",b:"b"}'
[12:01:01] <shbot> emanuele6: {"a":"a","b":"b"}
[12:01:12] <emanuele6> the example in the manual page works as expected.
[12:01:57] <emanuele6> it constructs an object with a set to "a" and b set to "b"
[12:02:43] <emanuele6> the object constructor is not just key:value. it can be key, $key, "\(EXPR)":(EXPR), etc
[12:02:47] <emanuele6> it's jq syntax
[12:03:06] <emanuele6> # jq . <<< '{a:"a",b:"b"}'
[12:03:08] <shbot> emanuele6: jq: parse error: Invalid numeric literal at line 1, column 3
[12:03:27] <emanuele6> this is just feeding something that is not json to jq
[12:03:34] <emanuele6> # jq . <<< '[range(5)]'
[12:03:36] <shbot> emanuele6: jq: parse error: Invalid numeric literal at line 1, column 10
[12:05:14] <emanuele6> if you want to run jq code from stdin, use -f /dev/stdin or something like that
[12:06:03] <emanuele6> but jq will only read JSON (or raw text when using -R), and it does not claim to treat {a:2} as valid JSON.

[12:11:55] <emanuele6> as you can see, {a:"a"} also makes the fromjson function fail.
[12:12:37] <emanuele6> where jq expects JSON, it parses JSON; not jq code, not javascript.

[14:20:42] <HelloShitty> and these are messages not from the script but from the commands themselves
[14:20:43] <geirha> so what you showed is probably not exactly what you ran in the script. I bet there's variables involved in the real code. Use set -x to see what it actually tries to run
[14:20:45] <geirha> !-x
[14:20:45] <greybot> set -x (or ''bash -x myscript'') makes bash output the exact command that it will run after parsing and expansion. You can put ''set -x'' just before the code you want to debug (turn off with ''set +x''). To add more information, change PS4 first: eg. PS4='+($?) $BASH_SOURCE:$FUNCNAME:$LINENO:'

[20:42:24] <Earnestly> E.g. tab["Sun"] = "%a"
[20:42:38] <Earnestly> 'Sun, ...' => '%a, ...'
[20:42:51] <phogg> pretty sure I've written one of those at one point, but likely there are others written better
[20:43:07] <phogg> it gets messy when you start supporting multiple locales

[23:08:55] <Blondie101010> sort -n does order those 2 keys properly
[23:09:03] <znf> "natural sorting" is what I was looking for
[23:09:08] *** Joins: polve (~polve@user/polve)
[23:09:19] <Blondie101010> so the example you gave is not good
[23:09:28] <tirnanog> 870 before 88 wouldn't be sorting by numeric value, would it.
[23:09:52] <Earnestly> js78 -e 'for(const d of scriptArgs) print(new Date(Date.parse(d)).toISOString())' -- '04 Dec 1995 00:12:00 GMT' 'Fri, 04 Feb 2022 00:00:00 -0600'
[23:09:56] <znf> oh wait, I'm dumb, I used -k2
[23:10:02] <grawity> there are cases that -n can't handle, like when the numbers aren't in a field by themselves
[23:10:25] <grawity> but e.g. "myfile100" "myfile45" "myfile6"
[23:10:31] <znf> wrong column, my bad
[23:11:11] <Earnestly> Or scriptArgs.forEach(date => print(new Date(Date.parse(date)).toISOString())) # works too

[23:11:59] <Earnestly> Date.parse() tries to handle weird dates too, I'm not sure of many tools which do
[23:12:18] <Earnestly> tirnanog: > cjs  couchdb  gjs  plowshare  polkit
[23:12:27] <tirnanog> interesting. I must take a look.
[23:13:00] <Earnestly> tirnanog: It's core of Gnome's javascript engine (spidermonkey)
[23:13:29] <grawity> js78 is usually there for polkit, yes
[23:13:40] <grawity> oh gjs uses the same version too
[23:13:57] <Earnestly> T_T I bet it has request API, XML parsers, etc. as well.  It tempts me!
[23:14:06] <Blondie101010> Earnestly:  most date parsers are designed to support anything they can guess, even if the input is not clearly defined
[23:14:16] <Earnestly> Blondie101010: Can you show me some?
[23:14:25] <Blondie101010> that means that you should always use the most logical and consistent format
[23:14:28] <Earnestly> Ideally a command-line tool

[23:54:57] <e36freak> Earnestly: i would bet small compilers like that don't optimize very well though
[23:55:42] <Earnestly> e36freak: It doesn't beat v8, JIT or not.  JIT is massive though
[23:56:07] <Earnestly> Yeah https://bellard.org/quickjs/bench.html
[23:56:14] <Earnestly> (higher number = betterer)
[23:56:18] <Earnestly> (except size)
[23:57:04] <Earnestly> Apparently though the problem with qjs is the API for using it in embedded environments; either it was too low level or not low enough, can't remember.  But it's apparently the main reason not many use it
[23:57:04] *** Quits: kilitary (~kilitary@188.242.105.134) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:57:30] <ormaaj> optimization is pretty arch-centric or can be. Pretty much anything with a custom backend (i.e. not llvm or other very mature backend) is going to be not the best without a ton of effort
[23:58:20] <Earnestly> Yet in many cases you can get 80-90% of the way there without much difficulty (relatively)
[23:58:48] <ormaaj> yeah. especially if you're not concerned with auto vectorization
