[04:26:40] <tirnanog> it directly contradicts https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/mkinitcpio#/usr_as_a_separate_partition.
[04:26:42] <phrik> Title: mkinitcpio - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
[04:26:42] <MacGyver> orangeFlu: Which the /usr-hook in mkinitcpio tries very hard to circumvent.
[04:26:58] <MacGyver> orangeFlu: So if you can move / as well, just do that and be done with it.
[04:26:59] <tirnanog> it implies that not even the usr hook is required.
[04:27:26] <orangeFlu> ok, so new idea: move / except for boot to a different partition

[04:35:58] <MacGyver> Make a backup :P
[04:36:29] <orangeFlu> it's better to move it as a whole, and i will figure out how to tell grub what to do later
[04:36:37] <heat> dd never fails :)

[04:36:56] *** Quits: srv (~cmd@user/srv) (Quit: Leaving)
[04:37:11] <heat> depends on the disk location of both partitions, new and old
[04:37:35] <MacGyver> Okay, let's labour under the assumption you'll move the entire / over.
[04:37:36] <orangeFlu> i was thinking to use dd to move sda2 (current) to sdb1 (new), and boot stays on sda1
[04:37:51] <MacGyver> You don't even need to use dd for that. cp works just fine.
[04:37:56] <orangeFlu> then i need to do something with UUIDs which i dont quite understand
[04:37:59] <MacGyver> Or pv, for nice progress :P
[04:38:18] <MacGyver> But anyway, yes, so you make a byte-for-byte copy of the filesystem in sda2 to sdb1.
[04:38:31] <MacGyver> Then you probably want to follow that up with a resize so that the filesystem occupies the entire sdb1.
[04:38:52] <orangeFlu> well, sdb1 is already the maximum size
[04:39:00] <orangeFlu> it's already a formed partition
[04:39:03] <MacGyver> The *partition* is the maximum size, yes.
[04:39:14] <MacGyver> But the filesystem you're copying into it was created on a smaller partition.
[04:39:18] <heat> note that if you want to only use sdb you can do that by dd'ing the whole disk 
[04:39:29] <heat> and that works, no need to mess with UUIDs
[04:39:33] <orangeFlu> i dont want to only use sdb
[04:39:42] <jkc> But you shouldn't use whole disks. You should be putting things in partitions.
[04:39:53] <MacGyver> jkc: heat means if they want to remove sda after this.
[04:40:02] <jkc> Ah.
[04:40:03] <MacGyver> jkc: You'd copy the disk over and so get all partitions.
[04:40:03] <heat> yes
[04:40:08] <jkc> Ah, full clone.
[04:40:08] <MacGyver> But they don't.
[04:40:10] <jkc> Right.
[04:40:13] <heat> or have it as a data partition or something
[04:40:23] <MacGyver> orangeFlu: So, copy, then resize to grow the filesystem to the partition size.
[04:40:39] <alad> orangeFlu: what was the reason for having /usr separate in the first place
[04:40:46] <MacGyver> Space.
[04:40:51] <jkc> the final frontier
[04:40:52] <orangeFlu> not enough space
[04:41:03] <orangeFlu> i have 2 gigs right now on my SD card
[04:41:13] <orangeFlu> the whole system fit fortunately
[04:41:29] <heat> running a whole system on an sd card yikes
[04:41:32] <orangeFlu> but after deleting the cache and everything, it left me with 300 mb
[04:41:46] <orangeFlu> it's a raspberry pi, what can i do
[04:42:17] <MacGyver> Well that certainly makes me unsure whether the advice I'm giving is actually best practice for a pi.
[04:42:33] <orangeFlu> doesn matter, let's do it anyway
[04:42:36] <orangeFlu> it's still archlinux
[04:42:42] <MacGyver> Technically you're not running arch -- but the process is the same.
[04:42:52] <orangeFlu> but it is arch
[04:42:57] <alad> no, it's not
[04:43:08] <heat> arch is x86_64 only
[04:43:12] <MacGyver> (Arch Linux ARM is not maintained by the same developers, nor used by many of us here -- they have their own support channel)
[04:43:26] <MacGyver> But we've come this far, so:
[04:43:43] <MacGyver> After the resize, there's two places you need to make sure reference the partitions correctly.
[04:43:50] <MacGyver> /etc/fstab, and the bootloader.
[04:44:01] *** Joins: Nistar (Nistar@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/nistar)
[04:44:16] <MacGyver> If you're using UUIDs (you'll recognize, it says that), they probably haven't changed because you did a byte-for-byte copy of the filesystem.
[04:44:27] <MacGyver> But that means there are now 2 filesystems *with the same UUID* on the system.
[04:44:31] <MacGyver> So you'll need to nuke the old one.

[05:59:16] <demonicmaniac1> depends on what you need/want really
[05:59:35] <demonicmaniac1> the screen is still fine just not usable for color accurate work on the E, the L do cost a good 200 to 300 more

[06:00:07] <demonicmaniac1> yeah. L also has 2 sodimm slots
[06:00:14] <demonicmaniac1> so you can put in 2x32gb for 64 total
[06:01:03] <demonicmaniac1> no idea where you live but in europe you can get edu models without windows like 25% cheaper for thinkpads. in the us there's probably something similar

[10:55:49] <haibar> I'm facing a weird issue w/ linux-ck kernel. I was using it for a while and all is good then came an update (through aur-helper) and compiling began. As I had to go use the PC for something else suddenly i aborted the compiler (ctrl-c) and went on. Later I let it update but it won't boot into that kernel. It boots into the linux, linux-zen and other kernels but not the linux-ck. I removed it and again installed it..etc but the 
[10:55:49] <haibar> same. It's the only kernel that won't run. Any ideas?

[10:56:09] <kevr> whether or not security even matters at all. The fact here is that, out of the box, SMB provides network mountage on windows, and it's not wrong for someone to want to use it.

[11:33:05] <jbox> yeah I've used fsck and SMART through vbox, and I'll use them both when I try to fix it on bare metal :)

[11:33:37] <jbm> jbox, sounds like you're talking in 360. I always mentioned to check your native system.
[11:34:05] <jbm> jbox, and by default afaik (for linux hosts) -- the default setting is bios-boots I think with vbox vm-guests.
[11:34:16] <jbm> jbox, how does NVMe apply here?
[11:34:25] <rcf> jbox: do it bare metal to avoid any Windows interference. If fsck doesn't work on the ESP, try reformatting it and reinstalling your bootloader. And if *that* doesn't work... and the IO errors are hardware... well, now you get to upgrade your old NVMe drive. 
[11:35:02] <jbox> rcf: it's a 2TB Sabrent Rocket Q that's not even a year old yet D:

[11:37:24] <rcf> jbox: well, if it's hardware there's not much you can do... other than blame the motherboard instead 
[11:37:31] <rcf> Which I'm sure you also really want to replace right now 
[11:38:08] <jbox> jbm: I think I've been pretty clear this whole time. I'm using the terms "host" and "guest" in the context of how I want to run my virtualbox setup when this is fixed. My windows host (which I will be running virtualbox on) is on a SATA SSD (I mention this for clarity) and my linux guest (which I will be booting in virtualbox) is on an NVMe SSD.
[11:39:25] <rcf> jbox: also, not sure if this will apply here or not, but if it complains about being unable to access the disk you should try the fallback initramfs. It has all the drivers, not just the ones you needed when you installed the linux package. 
[11:39:26] <jbm> jbox, uh, unless you have done a "full mapping" of an NVMe SSD device to the virtualbox, you can possibly refer an NVMe SSD as a device Vbox is accessing, otherwise you are mixing up where the physical hardware boundaries should reallyb be..
[11:39:32] <jbm> jbox, ^^^
[11:39:40] <jbox> I very much do want to replace my motherboard, but only because it doesn't have Bluetooth. I could really use a bluetooth card so I don't have to stay wired to my desktop when I want to use my PS3 controller, and it's not that big enough of deal to warrant a PCIe expansion card
[11:39:57] <rcf> jbm: that is indeed exactly what they did. 
[11:40:01] <jbox> jbm: you highlighted me and then highlighted me again pointing to your highlighted message lmfao
[11:40:01] <rcf> (the full mapping bit) 
[11:40:08] <jbm> jbox, and you can do that, but I am not sure how Windows is "accurate with that" -- I know it can be done on Linux by using /dev/by-id/[[[full device here]]]

[11:40:49] <rcf> Windows is accurate, though it always feels weird referring to full device names in the NT fashion. 
[11:40:50] <jbm> jbox, the problem is this is dangerous if the mapping radically bounced --- -- not sure if this is safe on Windows -- but I know it is pretty safe on Linux as I've done this long ago in the past at some point..

[11:41:26] <daspork> ...
[11:41:28] <rcf> jbm: it's safe if Windows can't mount any of the filesystems. Sadly, EFI means that it can. 
[11:41:33] <jbm> I wouldn't suggest it... it's too dangerous --- unpredictable -- the mapping can jump between boots******

[11:47:52] *** Joins: Cashlin (~hp@user/cashlin)
[11:48:04] <jbm> the problem with Windows.. is that the tools LIE a lot more than other platforms ----- the M$ documentation says \\Volume{}  --- when it wants to refer to either "SECTOR ZERO" or an "OFFSET FROM SECTOR 0" <<<< this is a very big problem... because  it leads users to think the beginning of the disk is "guaranteed" with \\Volume***   --- the \\Physical**\  <<< is sector 0.. and is the form I strongly suppose you were supposed to use.
[11:48:53] <jbm> jbox, ^^ that's a big problem with dealing with M$ garbage partitoin tools and its API for any program that deals with formatting things.  It's ugly, because you are FORCED to make a dull "letter drive" before a program can recognize a device and format it from sector 0 if it need be.
[11:49:15] <jbm> that's why Windows is not a very good platform for doing advanced device mappings that is way out of the spec I suppose....

[13:47:30] <Mion> try prime
[13:48:22] <noze> can you be more specific?
[13:48:47] <noze> I've used prime in the past when I had a laptop with a discrete internal gpu to manage its power state
[13:48:51] <Mion> basically the same as if you had dual graphics internal in the laptop

[13:49:42] <demonicmaniac1> just keep in mind tb throughput is low so copyinh back via tb and into the igp framebuffer is super slow
[13:49:54] <noze> hmm won't that result in the video signal being routed back through the laptop?
[13:50:19] <Mion> other than that you can write a xorg conf loads both drivers and then play with xrandr
[13:50:23] <Mion> may or may not work, ymmv
[13:50:31] <noze> yeah that's what I'm worried about. It's a common loss of perf on egpu, so I'd rather plug my monitor right into the egpu

[14:06:37] <Tom^> yeah somewhat. but i havent fiddled enough with the xrandr setprovideroutputsource // setprovideroffloadsink , but it still will at most be running some PRIME magic meaning loss of performance

[14:09:54] <noze> I did have an attempt at setprovideroffloadsink and friends, but couldn't get that to work. I'll update the laptop now, reboot, and have another stab at it. But yeah, basically I just want to get what Windows does out of the box (it's amazing how easy egpu is on W nowadays)

[16:05:31] <Namarrgon> i guess you could script it in grub.cfg but...
[16:06:19] <sa02irc> But GRUB does load the kernel, no? Technically it should be able to pass a variable as an argument somehow?
[16:06:37] <Namarrgon> yes but there is no protocol to hand off random data to the kernel
[16:06:41] <sa02irc> maybe with a little patch in GRUB itself... I have to look into it.
[16:06:56] <Namarrgon> you'd have to patch the kernel and initramfs, too
[16:07:19] <sa02irc> I think some of those arguments are passed to the initrd
[16:07:22] <sa02irc> that's what's needed
[16:07:39] <Namarrgon> the kernel commandline is but that's it
[16:07:42] <sa02irc> I have patched the initrd myself, so I know how to use the passed arguments
[16:07:58] <sa02irc> the kernel does not need to be patched
[16:08:01] <sa02irc> only the initrd
[16:08:10] <sa02irc> I can inject a custom script in it, that's no problem

Now when i try to enter XFCE through lightdm i am greeted with a black screen until returned to the lightdm login screen. If i try to run "startx" from the TTY it respons with "Only console users are allowed to run the X server", In my .xsession-errors file it says "Can't open display ':0'", "Authorization 
[16:15:46] <poipa> required, but no autorization protocol specified" and no i haven't touched any of the dotfiles one would assume xorg uses ("xinitrc, xresources") nor have i touched (".profile" and ".dmrc") what should i do?

[18:02:19] <umaxtu> the layering approach does seem to be more popular. of course, I've also got to figure out how to make it bootable with uefi too.
[18:03:32] <jkc> Official answer: You can't. UEFI will only read a FAT32 filesystem, not an mdraid or LVM PV.
[18:04:13] <jkc> Pragmatic answer: You CAN create a small mdraid mirror and set the partition type of both to ESP. When you create the md array, use metadata version 0.90.
[18:04:29] <jkc> And make sure that NOTHING NOTHING NOTHING writes to that mirror outside of intentional updates while its mounted as a mirror.
[18:05:10] <umaxtu> good thing I'm doing this in a throwaway vm initially then

[23:24:52] <Ar|stote|is> What I want to achieve, seems the most straightforward, is to have on the same disk one ESP and another luks partition with lvm, using 1 logical volume for each distribution rootfs and 1 more for shared data. Having the ability to update each distribution without messing the others. grub seems more complicated to achieve what I want, that is why I believe subfolders on ESP would be best. would another partition scheme make more 
[23:24:52] <Ar|stote|is> sense or be better for less maintenace, bonus points if changing distros on LVs would be easier.
