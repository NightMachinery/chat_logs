[02:40:44] <dto> borodust: hi
[02:41:10] <borodust> hi dto 
[02:41:27] <dto> how ru? :)_
[02:44:13] <borodust> ru as in russia or as are you? :D
[02:44:22] <dto> borodust: remember when i made music for your game
[02:44:35] <dto> as in, You :)
[02:46:16] <borodust> dto: i'm good thanks!
[02:46:24] <borodust> dto: yup, i do remember, for one of the jams
[02:46:25] <dto> hey good
[02:46:38] <borodust> PO did some sprites for the game :)
[02:46:42] <dto> yes!
[02:47:03] <dto> well i have returned to the world of experimental electronic dance music
[02:47:18] <borodust> noice!
[02:47:26] <dto> and made some cyber punk witch house music but with upscaled production values and a real singer
[02:47:34] <dto> would you like to hear a sample?
[02:47:53] <borodust> hooo, that's nice! yes, please 
[02:47:55] <dto> you will literally be among the FIRST on earth to hear the finished product
[02:48:01] <borodust> hehehe

[02:48:17] <dto> what will you listen on? speakers? headphones? 
[02:48:24] * borodust instaclicks
[02:48:27] <dto> enjoy! watch out it's loud and obnoxious
[02:51:02] <borodust> that's nothing like i heard before! arranging have this experimental feel, interesting
[02:51:28] <dto> hey so glad u enjoy!
[02:51:57] <dto> some of the feel comes from concatenative synthesis. it was the basis of the groove, and also the wash of "texture" that is all over 
[02:52:36] <dto> in fact i hacked on the code for a feature used in this, earlier today!
[02:52:48] <dto> so it's slices of pop music
[02:53:04] <dto> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/uKo32o1d/just-concat.mp3
[02:53:07] <dto> this is the stuff without the rest
[02:53:25] <dto> slices of like 50+ different dance tracks
[02:53:36] * borodust clicks
[02:53:38] <dto> the whole track is a hyper micro pastiche
[02:55:02] <borodust> hmm, well

[02:55:17] <dto> fun stuff huh? thanks for listening :)
[02:55:18] <borodust> that's certainly quite unusual ;p
[02:55:52] <borodust> gives psycho vibes ;p
[02:56:05] <dto> ha!
[02:56:12] <dto> well we have a much more mellow 2nd track going too
[02:57:48] <dto> want to hear that one? no vocals yet tho

[03:00:40] * borodust does it with link
[03:02:39] <dto> may i ask what audio device you are using to listen? 
[03:02:41] <dto> headphones? 
[03:03:37] <borodust> yup
[03:03:47] <dto> cool anything fancy? 
[03:04:00] <dto> just curious. i had it "AI mastered" by Landr.com. it sounds pretty decent to me. 
[03:04:18] <dto> i noticed it sounded much more balanced in the car after mastering
[03:04:32] <dto> i might have a human do the final job tho when a couple songs batch are ready
[03:04:45] <borodust> https://www.audio-technica.com/en-us/ath-w1000x
[03:05:00] <dto> OH
[03:05:16] <dto> ok so i'm using $500 monitors and you're using $700 headphones. i bet it sounded nice!
[03:05:19] <borodust> yeah, although mine are like 5+yo :D
[03:05:47] <dto> oh btw. the mastering was only done on the 1st track i sent. the obnoxious one
[03:06:49] <borodust> as for the last track, i don't know why, but it kinda gives alarmed theme in a visual novel
[03:06:51] <borodust> kinda
[03:06:53] <borodust> :D
[03:07:03] <dto> interesting !
[03:08:10] <dto> here's another groove https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/k4zpm1U7/concat-groove.mp3
[03:09:35] <borodust> oooohh, this one is the most witch-housy one 
[03:09:51] <dto> hey cool :) yeah
[03:10:12] <borodust> and more conventional sounding one)
[03:10:21] <borodust> thanks, cool work
[03:10:30] <borodust> gotta go sleepin'
[03:10:34] <dto> ok take care!

[21:54:25] <borodust> dto: do you have more or less up-to-date CL environment setup? :)
[21:54:49] <dto> hmm.
[21:55:48] <borodust> dto: i added UI to alien-works tools and need someone with CL env to check if it works for them, would you have time for such an endeavor?)
[21:55:59] <dto> one moment.
[21:56:26] <borodust> no hurry, i'm in the process of releasing stuff, gonna take more minutes
[21:56:53] <dto> updating quicklisp
[21:57:13] <dto> borodust: hey
[21:57:29] <dto> can u test my much new improved mix on those fancy ass headphones? and tell me what you think? 
[21:57:30] <borodust> dto: hello :D
[21:57:33] <dto> everything should be much clearer
[21:57:37] <dto> no rush
[21:57:45] <borodust> sure
[21:59:45] <dto> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/aBJXrMvI/bang-34-normalized.mp3
[22:00:34] * borodust clicks
[22:00:46] <dto> i removed the reverb on the concatenative synthesis tracks so they're much clearer, but had to remove some clicks and pops because of it. anyway the vocals are now pumped up with 2 layers of pitch shifting. up 4 semitones and down 4 semitones 
[22:01:52] <borodust> dto: when you will have time, give a peek to https://github.com/borodust/alien-works-demo#quicklisp
[22:02:13] <borodust> the result should be same helmet, but with UI over it
[22:03:08] <borodust> UI is in the tools part of alien-works that is not shipped to end-users hence the need to run it from sources
[22:04:10] <dto> its loading now
[22:04:28] <dto> hey so if you "approve" this mix, i'll master it at LANDR and then if u like, u can compare the AI-mastered version!
[22:04:36] <borodust> dto: it is indeed feels more clean, and idk, but bass seems deeper and less punchy too  (i like it that way more :D )
[22:05:12] <dto> i don't think i altered the bass much, i did filter out some of the bass in the concatenative synth
[22:05:19] <dto> brb
[22:05:47] <dto> back
[22:05:50] <dto> still compiling
[22:06:20] <dto> are you saying you want me to go back to the old sound or that you like the new bass sound better
[22:06:36] <borodust> i like this one better
[22:06:42] <borodust> the latter 
[22:06:42] <dto> great! 
[22:06:47] <dto> i'll have it mastered shortly!
[22:08:27] <borodust> jic, this track doesn't give me usual witch house atmosphere, rather than dark it goes into psycho territory
[22:08:29] <borodust> smth like that
[22:09:07] <borodust> don't take my opinoins on the subject for anything ;p
[22:09:25] <borodust> i'm not an expert, just giving a personal feedback
[22:10:22] <dto> borodust: error https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/CiAOm8aZ/Screenshot_2021-10-03_14-39-56.png
[22:10:52] <dto> hey borodust no worries i don't worry about labels :)
[22:10:53] <borodust> ohh, same one you had.. hmm
[22:11:15] <borodust> also, i bumped volume of the track a bit to better hear it
[22:11:24] <borodust> it's quieter than other stuff i have
[22:11:39] <dto> the master should fix that. the AI will compress, EQ
[22:11:41] <dto> maximize
[22:12:05] <dto> it's ready. i'll download and make an mp3
[22:12:35] <borodust> dto: btw, do you have anything in ~/quicklisp/local-projects ?
[22:12:42] <dto> looking
[22:13:32] <dto> maybe  this is it? https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/5hQCKjr6/Screenshot_2021-10-03_14-43-14.png
[22:14:23] <borodust> it is it, but should be fine

[22:20:13] <borodust> does it give any errors?
[22:20:49] <borodust> dto: this sounds better, volume wise, and not louder as usual stuff i have around too 
[22:21:38] <borodust> you can copy paste path from the screenshotted output
[22:21:56] <borodust> libSDL2-2.0.so from there

[22:26:41] <dto> ok so did you notice any anomalies? clicks pops weirdness? 
[22:28:32] <dto> maybe it could be called witchstep
[22:28:38] <borodust> hmm, not that i immediately notice anything, but it seems to clip a lil by looking in audacity tracks
[22:29:03] <borodust> maybe it perfectly scales, idk ;p
[22:29:07] <dto> hmm. i sent a normalized WAV to them and this is what they sent back.
[22:30:37] <dto> i thought i had set the master volume in lmms low enough to give me room and nothing clipped.  then i normalized that.
[22:30:38] <borodust> https://imgur.com/a/1s6pRKy
[22:30:54] <borodust> this seems suspicious
[22:30:56] <dto> damn
[22:30:59] <dto> hangon
[22:32:11] <dto> i'll use the thing in audacity that finds clipping i guess. 
[22:33:20] <dto> ok so this is what comes out of LMMS after i hit " https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/YhbqNK4T/ksdhjjdh
[22:33:24] <dto> "Normalize" in audacity
[22:33:27] <dto> it gets larger like this
[22:33:38] <dto> i turned down the master volume
[22:33:41] <dto> does this look ok now? 
[22:33:54] <dto> i thought it was like this last time but imaybe i'm wrong
[22:35:25] <borodust> this _looks_ better, but as you know, i'm certainly no sound designer ;p
[22:36:14] <dto> ok. well this is ok for now as long as it doesn't sound wrong on headphones. it's kind of a demo
[22:36:22] <borodust> actually, it looks like there would be not enough volume, whatev, just ignore me at this point
[22:36:24] <dto> but i was thinking of putting it on our soundcloud as a preview
[22:36:28] <borodust> go by your ear, i would say
[22:37:00] <borodust> it's was perfectly fine on headphones
[22:37:10] <borodust> s/'s//
[22:43:22] <borodust> dto: can you run ldd on libsdl2.clawed.so from screenshot? it should be in the same dir as libSDL2 you tried loading with cffi
[22:48:22] <dto>  borodust one moment
[22:48:54] <borodust> thanks!

[22:59:27] <borodust> dayum
[22:59:34] <borodust> weird)
[22:59:40] <borodust> looks good, but doesn't quite work
[23:00:56] <dto> let me know if you need any more help
[23:01:18] <dto> and thanks for checking out the music! 
[23:01:39] <borodust> no problemo, very interesting approach to music making)
[23:01:55] <borodust> i'm running same thing (alien-works demo) on mint live usb atm
[23:02:11] <borodust> hopefully, i'll be able to reproduce the issue
[23:03:43] <dto> keep me posted. do you think this is good enough to release as a preview teaser thing on SoundCloud? 
[23:04:01] <dto> our project has an account, but we want to debut a track. i need to run this final mix by the vocalist 
[23:04:12] <dto> she might want to add stuff too
[23:05:46] <dto> the vocal section is the pink band https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/0RS2v7cJ/Screenshot_2021-10-03_15-35-28.png
[23:07:34] <borodust> dto: genre is not what i usually listen to, so i can't say anything of likeness, but sounds was fine, crisp, nice bass
[23:08:09] <dto> are you aware of a band named Molchat Doma? 
[23:08:17] <dto> cool borodust i appreciate your thoughts. i'mglad .
[23:08:59] <borodust> molchat doma sounds very russian, looking ;p
[23:09:43] <borodust> it's actually translate like "be silent at home" or smth
[23:09:50] <borodust> s/'s//
[23:10:16] <borodust> oh, i see, belarusian
[23:12:11] <borodust> interesting, Etazhi album sounds smth like russia's 1980-1990 synth/pop rock
[23:12:52] <borodust> more pop than synth, yeh
[23:14:11] <borodust> similar to Viktor Coy - Summer Will Come To An End
[23:14:12] <borodust>  
[23:14:12] <borodust>  
[23:14:26] <borodust> woops, those newlines
[23:15:17] <dto> yeah i got into russian music through them. Alyans <---- from 80s
[23:29:30] <borodust> dto: yup, i reproduced the issue 
[23:29:53] <dto> hey cool
[23:30:09] <borodust> looks like local libsdl2 is getting picked up
[23:30:11] <borodust> again ;p
[23:30:17] <borodust> damn
[23:39:30] <borodust> dto: try this one: (ql:quickload :alien-works-demo) (cffi:load-foreign-library "/home/dto/quicklisp/dists/alien-works/software/alien-works-foundation-20211003212446/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/libSDL2-2.0.so.0") (alien-works:run)

[23:48:55] <dto> it puts up a non drawing window
[23:49:56] <borodust> dto: what does (uiop:implementation-identifier) say?
[23:50:58] <borodust> btw, found the reason why it loads local library, fixing
[23:51:38] <dto> "sbcl-1.4.5.debian-linux-x64"
[23:51:54] <dto> want to hear some concatenative synthesis on the other chiller song? 
[23:54:33] <borodust> well, yeh, i weren't able to run stuff on that sbcl ;p
[23:54:36] <borodust> it's too old
[23:55:05] <dto> oh okay.
[23:55:08] <borodust> try this ccl dist: https://github.com/Clozure/ccl/releases/download/v1.12/ccl-1.12-linuxx86.tar.gz
[23:55:10] <dto> i could update my sbcl.
[23:55:32] <borodust> it's super simple, just extract, run, install quicklisp, install dist
[23:55:47] <borodust> not sure what's the process for sbcl
[23:56:11] <borodust> dto: yup, sure, gimme that track :D
