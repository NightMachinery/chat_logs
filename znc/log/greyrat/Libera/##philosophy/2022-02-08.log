[03:26:31] <dTal> the popularity of live adaptations of comic books are a sad reflection of the infantilization of adulthood
[03:28:09] <ProfSimm> dTal: I would take this at face value if I wasn't following the movie industry up close. There's no popularity of live adaptations of comic books. There's just Marvel being good at making entertainment for the masses, no different than previous entertainment. The cheesy costumes are an unimportant detail.
[03:28:56] <ProfSimm> James Gunn only did The Suicide Squad and Peacemaker because he's cut his teeth at Marvel, and then was fired by Disney.
[03:28:59] <ProfSimm> That's basically it.
[03:29:06] <dTal> Nah, it's not all Marvel. How many Spodermon films we on now?
[03:29:07] <ProfSimm> We have zero other successful superhero movies.
[03:29:13] <dTal> Dark Knight?
[03:29:13] <ProfSimm> That's Marvel.
[03:29:16] *** Quits: TheHermann (~TheHerman@gateway/tor-sasl/thehermann) (Quit: Leaving)
[03:29:27] <ProfSimm> Dark Knight is not Marvel.
[03:29:35] <dTal> Indeed.
[03:29:37] <ProfSimm> But that's not exactly a typical superhero movie is it
[03:29:48] <dTal> Spodermon (2002) is Sony pictures, not Marvel
[03:30:32] <dTal> Marvel is riding the wave, but they didn't start it, and they wouldn't be able to ride it if they weren't selling something people wanted.
[03:30:58] <dTal> Hell, Pixar was spoofing the superhero genre in *2004*.
[03:30:59] <ProfSimm> dTal: doesn't explain why people didn't want Snyder's take
[03:31:38] <ProfSimm> dTal: Look at any other massive franchise and tell me it's not about superheroes, even though it's not based on comic books.
[03:31:51] <ProfSimm> James Bond, Mission Impossible. Fast & Furious
[03:32:11] <dTal> Okay. They're not about superheros.
[03:32:11] <ProfSimm> Go back to westerns. Same deal.
[03:32:28] <ProfSimm> Is it the spandex that you find most important.
[03:32:35] <dTal> No, it's the magical powers.
[03:32:51] <ProfSimm> Did Batman have magical powers?
[03:32:55] <dTal> The explicitly magical in-universe powers.
[03:33:02] <ProfSimm> No
[03:33:07] <dTal> Batman is a comic book
[03:33:10] <dTal> what's your point
[03:33:25] <ProfSimm> So it's either magical powers, or comic books.
[03:33:38] <ProfSimm> We're kinda widening the definition a bit
[03:34:07] <dTal> It's infantilization. It's the legitimization of crudely childish fantasies.
[03:34:29] <ProfSimm> It is infantilization, but not because of comic books, or the colorful costumes, or magic.
[03:34:29] <dTal> Yes, we had childish fantasies before. They didn't have the cultural cachet they have now.
[03:35:18] <ProfSimm> It is infantilization, because like all other mainstream movies it's about people who are single-handedly, or in very small teams, saving the world, mostly by punching people, blowing up things, and firing guns.
[03:35:30] <ProfSimm> This is not something superheroes only have.
[03:35:57] <dTal> Even in the 60s, being a James Bond *fan*, with James Bond bedspreads and posters and so on, would have got you funny looks
[03:36:15] <dTal> but people think nothing of Marvel-izing their house
[03:36:27] <ProfSimm> [citation needed]
[03:37:04] <dTal> Not all mainstream movies follow the pattern you describe, but that is certainly a specifically objectionable pattern.
[03:37:08] <ProfSimm> Honestly if you think people were infantile only in the recent decade, I mean didn't you read about the ideology that brought us World War  II?
[03:37:26] <ProfSimm> It's an exceptionally common pattern.
[03:37:27] <dTal> is this a Godwin
[03:37:29] <dTal> did I win
[03:37:40] <ProfSimm> OK you win.
[03:37:42] <ProfSimm> One internet.
[03:37:56] <dTal> :)
[03:38:30] <dTal> But in all seriousness
[03:38:46] <dTal> I am feeling a real phenomenon here that I am trying to articulate
[03:38:58] <dTal> this is not just rose tinted nostalgia goggles
[03:39:21] <Delf> What're you getting at? Pacifying the people through entertainment?
[03:39:30] <dTal> I would say the attitude is fairly purely expressed in this webcomic https://xkcd.com/150/
[03:39:30] <ro-bot-o> [url] xkcd: Grownups | xkcd.com
[03:39:45] <dTal> People don't *want* to grow up anymore.
[03:39:45] <ProfSimm> dTal: I think the comic book trend is purely Marvel. Yes there's Batman and the odd Spiderman, but those were rare movies back in the day, not 10 movies a year thing.
[03:40:01] <ProfSimm> dTal: but the flaws of entertainment span much wider category.
[03:40:29] <ProfSimm> dTal: I'd say look at any movie poster with someone posting with a gun, and you know it falls into that category.
[03:40:35] <ProfSimm> posing*
[03:40:43] <ProfSimm> Not that having a gun means the movie is bad.
[03:40:50] <ProfSimm> But it's basically infected by that mindset.
[03:41:04] <ProfSimm> We gotta kick, boom and shoot our way to victory.
[03:41:29] <dTal> Yes, that is a seperate thing, that is also toxic, and I think much older
[03:41:52] <ProfSimm> Well the DCEU is in shambles.
[03:41:59] <dTal> this meme that institutions are untrustworthy and rightfully subverted and circumvented by powerful individuals
[03:42:03] <ProfSimm> Universal's "Monsterverse" died before it started
[03:42:07] <dTal> a sort of Randian view
[03:42:14] <ProfSimm> So those are trying to be Marvel and failing at it.
[03:42:33] <ProfSimm> Heck even Star Wars failed at it. Despite being Disney

[03:47:23] <dTal> I wouldn't say it's rare anymore. Black and white morality is out of fashion.
[03:47:55] <dTal> The closest thing to a recent purely black and white morality film I can think of is Taken, and it was widely mocked for it
[03:47:57] <ProfSimm> dTal: well it means we're growing then in some sense. What's more infantile than "us good guys vs evil guys"
[03:48:28] <ProfSimm> Eh Taken was Luc Beson being Luc Beson, you know him
[03:48:50] <ProfSimm> He likes simple high concept movies
[03:48:59] <dTal> John Wick is almost exactly the same film, except the main character gets to be an antihero. Look! Shades of grey!
[03:49:09] <dTal> Progress!
[03:49:15] <ProfSimm> Eeeh, nah.
[03:49:22] <Ungwelian> I don't like moral relativism.
[03:49:30] <ProfSimm> I think John Wick falls straight into the "video game fantasy" movies
[03:49:37] <Ungwelian> There is such a thing as good and evil.
[03:49:39] <ProfSimm> Yes it's high concept. It's just an action movie
[03:49:58] <dTal> John Wick and Taken are both revenge porn movies
[03:50:04] <ProfSimm> Ungwelian: well, I don't like things but they're what they are
[03:50:27] <dTal> they exist for you to get visceral sadistic joy out of watching someone brutally murder people who deserve it
[03:50:35] <dTal> highly escapist
[03:50:50] <ProfSimm> dTal: dunno. It's about his car and his dog. I don't think the movie is trying to focus on the revenge, it's not taking itself that seriously. It's made by stuntpeople
[03:51:27] <Ungwelian> I think the "grey morality" craze in entertainment probably means, that they're out of ideas.
[03:51:28] <ProfSimm> Either way I'm not that big a fan of John Wick
[03:51:36] <Ungwelian> So things are made complex, when they aren't.
[03:51:44] <ProfSimm> I appreciate the videogame mood, but it's kinda bunch of empty calories
[03:51:45] <Ungwelian> A bit like with soap operas.
[03:51:46] <dTal> Taken relies on pre-existing cultural memes, and doesn't need to work too hard to get us on the side of the father. John Wick invests a chunk of the film right at the beginning to get us to bond with the dog.
[03:52:36] <dTal> "His car and his dog?" I'm not sure you understand John Wick. It's about his dog.
[03:52:47] <ProfSimm> dTal: and his car
[03:52:49] <ProfSimm> ;-)
[03:53:07] <ProfSimm> dTal: it's actually about his wife. The dog was just the last thing he had
[03:53:33] <dTal> Yeah, I know that's what they said, to get us to believe that a guy would go on a rampage.
[03:53:51] <dTal> The car wouldn't cut it, they just threw that in for seasoning.
[03:54:24] <dTal> They had to do something that would enrage us so completely that at no point in the following hour of bloodbath would we pause and ask ourselves if, hang on, maybe he's going a little far
[03:54:30] <ProfSimm> Also there's something else in Marvel movies you don't appreciate. They're trying to show us flawed people coming together and trying to fit together, work as a team. Avengers, Ant-man, Guardians of the Galaxy especially, all focuses on that
[03:54:45] <ProfSimm> And disagreements, fights and so on
[03:55:02] <ProfSimm> It's not just them being powerful together.
[03:55:10] <ProfSimm> They don't even like each other most of the time
[03:55:14] <ProfSimm> Especially initially

[06:28:54] <ProfSimm> Delf: The average thriving of the parts in a whole is higher than the average thriving of parts separated from a whole.
[06:29:06] <ProfSimm> Delf: caring for one another is a form of complementation. Forming a whole.
[06:29:32] <Delf> What whole?
[06:29:38] <ProfSimm> Delf: the instinct to care for each other has formed because those who complement, survive more than those that don't complement
[06:30:24] <ProfSimm> Delf: family, neighborhood, village, town, city, region, country, union... humanity
[06:31:27] <Delf> None of those qualify as a reason to care, not today
[06:32:28] <ProfSimm> Delf: you're welcome to judge your specific circumstances. These instincts that compel us to care didn't form spontaneously in every individual. They formed over millennia and hundreds of generations.

[06:43:36] <ProfSimm> Delf: what is corruption in a society
[06:44:34] <ProfSimm> Corruption is the models that hold us together falling apart, and us reverting back to more primitive state. Where we don't mind harming each other for personal gain.
[06:44:54] <ProfSimm> Corruption is not something that only happens if you're a politician
[06:45:03] <ProfSimm> It's a wider process.
[06:45:05] <ProfSimm> It's like cancer.
[06:45:14] <ProfSimm> Cancer cells are cells that stopped caring
[06:45:25] <ProfSimm> They thrive for a while.
[06:45:31] <ProfSimm> They consume more, they divide faster.
[06:45:40] <ProfSimm> But they corrupt their host and eventually kill it
[06:45:48] <ProfSimm> That's prisoner's dilemma, game theory.
[06:46:09] <ProfSimm> If there's a small minority that doesn't care, it does better than the rest.
[06:46:23] <ProfSimm> If that minority grows, it dies and takes the rest of society with it
[06:46:42] <ProfSimm> So that's really the game you're asking me about.
[06:46:51] <ProfSimm> You're free to play as you wish.

[06:50:04] <ro-bot-o> [url] The Thousand Brains Theory of Intelligence | numenta.com
[06:50:36] <ProfSimm> In a nutshell it says, you're not one mind. You're thousands of minds. Each looking at the world differently.
[06:50:51] <ProfSimm> Those thousands mind all process the world in individually simple ways. Then they vote.
[06:50:57] <ProfSimm> And your behavior is what won the vote
[06:51:16] <ProfSimm> This underlines the importance of redundancy in system's behavior.
[06:51:38] <ProfSimm> You need to have hundreds of models want to care, for you to care.
[06:51:52] <ProfSimm> This is also how society works.
[06:52:20] <ProfSimm> Fear of police, fear of social embarrassment, fear of violence, those are some models that hold society together.
[06:52:30] <ProfSimm> Money, power, greed, those are some more.
[06:52:46] <ProfSimm> But care, empathy, benevolence, altruism, those are some more.
[06:52:54] <ProfSimm> Society needs all of them in balance to thrive.
[06:53:09] <ProfSimm> Try to look at society through just one model, and it distorts and corrupts.
[06:53:21] <ProfSimm> No one model is correct. They're all approximate.
[06:54:13] <ProfSimm> It's good that you work for a salary. But you also need to like your job to thrive. It helps also if you care for your coworkers. And so on

[06:59:20] <causative> one model may be mostly correct

[07:09:31] <ProfSimm> I_Am_M00t: I don't think you can operate your car just on limbic system. It offloads a lot processing, sure.
[07:10:21] <I_Am_M00t> you mean they need a nEoCorTex too?
[07:11:11] <causative> the basic problem is that current ML lacks a way to make 1000 brains work together effectively
[07:11:13] <ProfSimm> I_Am_M00t: in effect, they do need a small neocortex yes. The neocortex is basically, I'll use a crude analogy again, like a giant FPGA that gets reconfigured as you learn
[07:11:21] <causative> just "voting" isn't really a plan
[07:11:21] <I_Am_M00t> hehe
[07:11:30] <causative> because sometimes one brain's vote should count more than another brain's
[07:11:40] <I_Am_M00t> it needs to "understand" things to some extent, whatever that means
[07:11:43] <causative> in some situations some brains are more important than others
[07:11:48] <I_Am_M00t> and not just "label"
[07:12:19] <ProfSimm> causative: yes, those situations are differentiated by our emotions, which are regulated by more primitive "brains" i.e. parts of our brain.
[07:12:45] <I_Am_M00t> my guess however, is that they'll adapt traffic to self-driving AI, so the self-driving AI doesn't need to be that smart
[07:12:47] <ProfSimm> causative: the brain has modes. Not binary, more like weights

[07:18:39] <ProfSimm> I_Am_M00t: well look we just can't do that. If we could, we already would. Instead there's weather, incidents, animals, bad infrastructure, drunken drivers, malfunctioning cars, children crossing and so on

[07:20:10] <ProfSimm> We literally need to just lay down dirt on the road so we have no potholes, and we can't find money for that. But you think we can find the money to maintain infrastructure to guide computers like those toy car race tracks?
[07:20:43] <ProfSimm> Bike lanes are just small lanes.
[07:20:49] <I_Am_M00t> again, that's not my idea
[07:20:52] <ProfSimm> What are AI lanes?
[07:22:01] <ProfSimm> I_Am_M00t: there have been self-driving car prototypes in the 80s using AI lanes etc.
[07:22:24] <ProfSimm> I_Am_M00t: if it was viable at scale, it would have happened. It's happening now because we have computing that doesn't need AI lanes.
[07:22:53] <ProfSimm> No, I'm wrong even. 1939
[07:23:03] <ProfSimm> "In GM's 1939 exhibit, Norman Bel Geddes created the first self-driving car, which was an electric vehicle guided by radio-controlled electromagnetic fields generated with magnetized metal spikes embedded in the roadway. By 1958, General Motors had made this concept a reality."
[07:23:43] <ProfSimm> We suck so much we can't even maintain the white lines paint on our roads consistently
[07:23:50] <ProfSimm> What about anything more complicated.
[07:24:17] <ProfSimm> I think if we want car on rails, we have trains already and they work

[07:34:17] <I_Am_M00t> what's the point even, you're on another topic
[07:34:33] <I_Am_M00t> it just uses similar keywords

[07:43:20] <causative> the human brain is able to learn things across an indefinite number of time steps - days or years, perhaps trillions of steps - each time step being a layer, in the backprop model
[07:46:23] <ProfSimm> causative: assuming the brain is learning as a single giant blob is extremely unlikely
[07:46:34] <ProfSimm> causative: it's likely highly, extremely modular.

[07:46:38] <ro-bot-o> [url] The Thousand Brains Theory of Intelligence | numenta.com
[07:50:32] <ProfSimm> causative: dunno if you've seen Rick & Morty, but basically imagine our brain is like A Million Ants :P
[08:08:47] <causative> ProfSimm, the greatest achievements in ML have been trained fully end-to-end
[08:09:08] <causative> AlphaStar, AlphaZero, GPT3
[08:09:16] <brigand> re:superhero movies: they're making them just now so much because the filming technology is so far that it doesn't look like a joke. and they have no better writing material
[08:10:24] <causative> if there's a way to make an AI agent that *isn't* trained end-to-end, but is made up of modular components trained separately, and is competitive with the state of the art, ML researchers have not found it
[08:10:24] <ProfSimm> causative: let's say that taking our great success and imagine it projected forever in a cartoony way is not our best example of high intelligence
[08:10:53] <causative> see above
[08:11:03] <ProfSimm> causative: we're literally using such AI right now. Tesla's AI is not made of a single blob of neurons
[08:13:41] <causative> afaik self-driving cars tend to operate by using ML to create a data pipeline that generates high-level propositions (like "there is an obstacle at position XYZ"), and then hand-written algorithms to handle those propositions
[08:15:01] <ProfSimm> causative: yes, different models make different observations and they're brought together. This is a very simplistic way in which our brain is hypothesized to work too.
[08:15:06] <causative> that is, it doesn't train itself except at the sensory level - everything about how it operates on higher levels must be painstakingly generated by hand
[08:15:13] <causative> human hands
[08:15:35] <causative> this is not a scalable approach to full general intelligence
[08:15:42] <ProfSimm> Isn't it.
[08:15:48] <ProfSimm> How does your brain work.
[08:16:09] <ProfSimm> It's partly fixed structure from birth, i.e. genetics, and partly trained models that make propositions
[08:16:28] <ProfSimm> Sure, we're much more flexible, but it's the grain of the same idea. Modularity
[08:16:39] <ProfSimm> It's not just one big network
[08:16:48] <ProfSimm> Well it is in a wider sense.
[08:17:00] <ProfSimm> But it has structure, level of detail if you will
[08:17:18] <ProfSimm> Neurons forming modules, which become metaneurons in a new network
[08:17:28] <causative> it's not modularity that's the point, the point is whether the modules can self-organize or whether they must be given hard-coded algorithms from a human programmer
[08:17:58] <causative> certainly the brain is to some degree modular, but there is no human programmer to tell it how to act in different circumstances - the brain must learn this for itself
[08:17:59] <ProfSimm> I don't think there's a single intelligent being born on this planet that self-organizes from a blank sheet.
[08:18:27] <ProfSimm> The role of the human programmer fills the role of evolution
[08:18:29] <causative> well, certainly it is not a completely blank slate, there are some instincts
[08:18:44] <causative> but as we go higher up the evolutionary chain, the role of instinct becomes less significant
[08:18:57] <ProfSimm> I don't think so
[08:19:00] <causative> insects operate entirely by hard-coded rules, with very little learning
[08:19:09] <ProfSimm> They learn quite a lot actually
[08:19:19] <ProfSimm> But sure
[08:19:25] <causative> not compared to vertebrates
[08:19:32] <causative> it's about system-1 and system-2
[08:19:32] <ProfSimm> The simpler the animal, the more ready it is from moment 1 to go
[08:19:38] <ProfSimm> And the less it can learn/adapt
[08:20:08] <causative> invertebrates are almost entirely system-1
[08:20:18] <I_Am_M00t> that's why i need 40 years to grow up
[08:20:22] <I_Am_M00t> im very complex
[08:20:28] <causative> the higher up we go, the more learning and deliberation play a role, and the less we rely on perfect hard-coded instincts
[08:20:33] <ProfSimm> You are I_Am_M00t
[08:20:41] <I_Am_M00t> 😏
[08:20:43] <causative> i.e. the more we rely on system 2
[08:20:48] * I_Am_M00t   
[08:20:54] *** Joins: b93 (~00@a94-132-238-173.cpe.netcabo.pt)
[08:21:13] <causative> manual hard-coded algorithms are sufficient for insect-type system-1 behavior
[08:21:26] <ProfSimm> causative: that statement is technically correct. It's more. But I think you're underestimating you're still mostly driven by instincts. Coated in your complex neocortex retroactive explanations of what you do and why
[08:21:39] <causative> but you don't get a human mind by making a bigger insect
[08:22:07] <ProfSimm> causative: my point is you and an insect are not fundamentally different.
[08:22:14] <ProfSimm> It's a game of proportions.
[08:22:35] <I_Am_M00t> truth
[08:22:36] <causative> you learned almost everything you know about the world
[08:22:49] <causative> your genes didn't program you with how to drive a car, or how to play chess, or how to type
[08:22:56] <causative> none of those things were in your evolutionary history
[08:23:02] <ProfSimm> I learned what I know, that's kinda the definition.
[08:23:13] <ProfSimm> A fly also did
[08:23:17] <causative> no, it's not true for a fly
[08:23:18] <ProfSimm> Learn all it knows
[08:23:25] <ProfSimm> Really.
[08:23:26] <causative> most of what a fly knows, is hard-coded instinct
[08:23:34] <causative> your genes programmed you with a tremendous ability to adapt and act in a goal-oriented manner
[08:23:37] <causative> it didn't do that for a fly
[08:23:48] <causative> flies don't have culture
[08:23:50] <ProfSimm> Yeah that's the good old "I'm smart and have free will, while smaller animals are robots" fallaxy
[08:23:54] <ProfSimm> Very uhmm 50s
[08:23:57] <ProfSimm> Or earlier
[08:24:01] <causative> it's not a fallacy
[08:24:15] <ProfSimm> Believe what you want to believe.
[08:24:17] <causative> actually in the 50s they were saying the opposite, i.e. they expected hard-coded algorithms to yield human intelligence
[08:24:21] <causative> that's GOFAI
[08:24:57] <causative> modern self-driving cars are a lot like GOFAI, at least in the core algorithms
[08:25:06] <causative> obstacle avoidance and such
[08:25:09] <ProfSimm> causative: GOFAI is not outdated
[08:25:24] <ProfSimm> I'll never get tired of saying "not or" but "and".
[08:25:50] <causative> the ultimate expression of GOFAI is stuff like OpenCyc
[08:25:57] <causative> which doesn't really work
[08:26:27] <causative> too many rules, no coherent principles for organizing and using them, or for noticing when some of them give bad results
[08:26:29] <ProfSimm> When you go to car drive lessons, they literally teach you a set of mechanical rules about how driving works. Training is a part of it.
[08:26:48] <ProfSimm> Why wouldn't we express this in a car driver. We would of course
[08:26:51] <causative> no, they don't get root access to your brain and program you with an algorithm
[08:26:54] <I_Am_M00t> when you go car drive lessons, you already know 99% of what you need to drive
[08:27:04] <I_Am_M00t> before you get into the car for the first time
[08:27:05] <ProfSimm> causative: they would if they could, dude
[08:27:15] <causative> they can't - it would be completely impractical
[08:27:30] <causative> they don't understand how your brain works, they can't go editing it neuron by neuron
[08:27:32] <I_Am_M00t> and don't you forget thatttt
[08:27:34] <ProfSimm> causative: is it. "I know kung fu". There, very practical
[08:27:41] <causative> that was a movie
[08:27:45] <ProfSimm> Yes.
[08:28:08] <ProfSimm> It's a movie because we would if we could.
[08:28:19] <ProfSimm> With computers we can, and your objection is it's like insects.
[08:28:22] <ProfSimm> OK
[08:28:24] <causative> the driving instructor instead presents you with sensory stimuli, from which you draw your own conclusions; your brain self-organizes based on the sensory stimuli, until eventually it successfully builds structures that can be invoked to drive a car.
[08:28:38] <I_Am_M00t> --->>>>>>>>> When you get driving lessons, you already know 99% of what you need to drive <-----
[08:28:48] <causative> the driving instructor doesn't know what those structures are, and they are different structures for every person
[08:29:16] <ProfSimm> causative: is this what we want on the street. Millions of snowflakes with their unique creative intepretations on the concept of driving? No.
[08:29:26] <causative> that's what we *have* on the streets
[08:29:33] <causative> every brain is different
[08:29:40] <ProfSimm> Yes and guess what, this is why we're making computers to replace it.
[08:30:12] <I_Am_M00t> no it isn't ProfSimm, the reason you want self-driving is because it's more efficient, not because it's safer.
[08:30:16] <I_Am_M00t> safety is just a side-effect
[08:30:24] <I_Am_M00t> $$$
[08:30:40] <causative> first you said that programming a car with GOFAI methods was just like a driving instructor telling a person how to drive
[08:31:03] <causative> then I pointed out that actually it isn't, that the driving instructor has no idea how your brain works and just presents you with stimuli that you make sense of yourself
[08:31:04] <ProfSimm> causative: this is what a driving instructor does and how your average teacher teaches kids.
[08:31:31] <causative> and now you're saying that it doesn't matter that how a person learns to drive is much different from how a car is programmed to drive with GOFAI
[08:31:35] <causative> so you're contradicting yourself
[08:31:39] <ProfSimm> causative: the fact they can't do it precisely and efficiently is because no one wants a lobotomy I guess
[08:32:11] <ProfSimm> I'm not contradicting myself, I'm saying what our approach is striving for, and with computers we can reach it much more than with humans.
[08:32:17] <causative> first you say the methods are similar and that's a positive thing for GOFAI, then I point out they're very different, and then you say they're different and that's a positive thing for GOFAI
[08:32:44] <ProfSimm> Okay you can read yourself repeat the same thing over and over or read my reply that clearly explains my PoV. Your call
[08:33:25] <ProfSimm> Humans are relatively shitty at teaching rulesets to one another.
[08:33:33] <ProfSimm> We're trying because we need it.
[08:33:40] <causative> we're great at it
[08:33:41] <ProfSimm> Computers are better at it
[08:33:45] <ProfSimm> Oh yeah sure
[08:33:48] <ProfSimm> Pffft
[08:34:14] <ProfSimm> Talk to you in 10 years, let's see.
[08:34:32] <ProfSimm> We won't have Schumacher in Tesla's AI, that is self-taught talent.
[08:34:49] <ProfSimm> But we'll have let's say vastly better than the average brain wonder that's on the streets
[08:34:58] <causative> GOFAI may succeed for self-driving cars, indeed in many ways it already has
[08:35:03] <causative> but a self-driving car is not a general intelligence
[08:35:09] <causative> it's an insect, not a human
[08:35:39] <causative> a self-driving car can't walk into a pizza shop and learn how to make pizzas in an afternoon - a taxi driver can
[08:35:53] <ProfSimm> The thing classifying your photos as "chihuahua playing with a red ball in a green grass field during a sunny day" is also an insect.
[08:36:10] <causative> yes, true
[08:36:23] <ProfSimm> So insects interpret your data, drive your cars, even replace the faces in your porn.
[08:36:27] <ProfSimm> That's some insects.
[08:36:42] <ProfSimm> I guess we need insects then
[08:36:42] <causative> yes, they're very useful
[08:37:00] <ProfSimm> We can do the rest that's important, like get drunk and write poems about it
[08:37:06] <causative> sure, they pollinate your crops and make fertilizer out of compost
[08:38:08] <causative> what they don't do, is learn new modes of operation from experience. And they don't reflect or imagine - they aren't good at cognitive tasks that feed back into themselves
[08:38:27] <causative> insects aren't engineers
[08:38:37] <I_Am_M00t> ecosystems would collapse without insects
[08:38:44] <causative> sure
[08:39:06] <I_Am_M00t> we depend on insects
[08:39:09] <I_Am_M00t> they don't depend on us
[08:39:11] <ProfSimm> causative: insects aren't engineers, but evolutionary algorithms have been for couple of decades at least
[08:39:29] <ProfSimm> causative: so, sorry, insects are engineers by your analogy
[08:39:47] <causative> the current state of modern ML, is that it is good at anything that a human can do in a split second - identifying a horse, swerving to avoid a pedestrian, etc.
[08:39:50] <ProfSimm> They design antennas, capacitors, find new materials. And so on
[08:39:53] <ProfSimm> Engineering
[08:40:13] <I_Am_M00t> :D
[08:40:13] <causative> modern ML has mastered quick-reaction tasks, *provided* that we have billions of examples of labeled training data for those tasks
[08:40:25] <I_Am_M00t> vrooom goes evolution
[08:40:30] <causative> this is an insect-type of response
[08:40:35] <I_Am_M00t> it's a lurning algore ithm
[08:41:03] <causative> what it hasn't mastered is the ability to ponder: to take what it had determined before, and combine it with other things it had determined before in new inferences
[08:41:24] <ProfSimm> causative: first, it's not "billions". And second, ML actually doesn't need human-labeled data to train itself in some cases.
[08:41:37] <causative> it's billions
[08:41:48] <causative> if you want true state of the art
[08:42:28] <causative> yes, it doesn't all have to be manually labeled,that depends on what task you want it to do
[08:42:32] <causative> GPT3 makes its own labels
[08:43:24] <ProfSimm> Tesla is actually not just training their AI on video feeds, but in simulations.
[08:43:32] <ProfSimm> Automatically generated ones.
[08:43:40] <ProfSimm> You know with 50s techniques
[08:43:45] <I_Am_M00t> Tesra is essentially building a limBiC syStem
[08:44:16] <ProfSimm> Not good enough. I want my Tesla AI to have existential crisis while it's driving me home.
[08:44:44] <I_Am_M00t> TeSrA is building objecT ocClusion
[08:45:04] <I_Am_M00t> tesla is working on semantics
[08:45:14] <I_Am_M00t> and handwaving commands
[08:45:35] <I_Am_M00t> we need top AI minds to help us build Reel world AI (TM)
[08:45:56] <ProfSimm> The vision system of Tesla builds a 3D model of the road and in time (predicted and current motion etc.)
[08:46:03] <ProfSimm> Sure it's specialized for cars, not general purpose.
[08:46:10] <I_Am_M00t> it's kinda general purpose
[08:46:12] <I_Am_M00t> not cars
[08:46:22] <ProfSimm> But technically we also do that. Build 3D models out of what we see in 2D
[08:46:38] <I_Am_M00t> it'll have to understand very general concepts, like object permanence
[08:46:41] <ProfSimm> It's a simpler version but very close to what we do
[08:46:44] <I_Am_M00t> that ain't related to cars
[08:46:44] <ProfSimm> Of course
[08:47:04] <I_Am_M00t> i bet most of what it'll know in the end won't be related to cars at all, just a small set of things
[08:47:06] <ProfSimm> Well my point is I don't know it'll be able to cook an omelette.
[08:47:08] <I_Am_M00t> just like human drivers
[08:47:11] <ProfSimm> But that's a good thing.
[08:47:24] <I_Am_M00t> it will know a lot of things needed to cook an omelette
[08:47:24] <causative> a long, long time ago, in the 90s and even the 00s, GOFAI was used for vision - algorithmic edge and shape detection
[08:47:24] <ProfSimm> Our own brain also specializes for tasks. Not just the limbic system
[08:47:40] <ProfSimm> causative: all of this informs NN today
[08:47:48] <I_Am_M00t> meh, self-driving is a general AI thing
[08:47:49] <causative> all of it was obliterated by NN
[08:47:51] <I_Am_M00t> it's not about driving
[08:47:51] <causative> in 2011
[08:48:08] <ProfSimm> causative: you need an idea of the algorithm because you can't slap some videos on a NN and tell it "SEE"
[08:48:15] <causative> all the manually designed algorithms for point, edge, shape, object detection - all gone.  All obsolete.
[08:48:27] <ProfSimm> Man that's... bs
[08:48:48] <I_Am_M00t> object PERMANENCE im tellin uuu :>
[08:48:57] <I_Am_M00t> semantics! <-- im tellin uuu :>
[08:49:17] <causative> ReLUs and backpropagation, incredibly simple in principle, was better than decades of manual design
[08:50:01] <ProfSimm> causative: our vision ANN are still broken down into things like edge detection scale invariance, rotation invariance, features, objects, and so on
[08:50:10] <ProfSimm> causative: how is that not building on top of what we had.
[08:50:28] <causative> because the ReLUs and backpropagation had one thing the manual coders did not: automatic self-correction
[08:50:29] <I_Am_M00t> those features may be learned though ProfSimm
[08:50:31] <ProfSimm> Yes we have a new powerful tool in the box.
[08:50:45] <causative> that's what it's all about
[08:50:48] <ProfSimm> Well it's not like the ANN decided to do edge detection
[08:50:54] <I_Am_M00t> ProfSimm: it kinda is
[08:51:02] <ProfSimm> That's not how it works.
[08:51:05] <I_Am_M00t> it has spatial awareness, it learns the relevant features
[08:51:09] <I_Am_M00t> it kind of is though ProfSimm
[08:51:11] <causative> the power of a machine to notice when it is doing something wrong, and correct its behavior in the right direction to avoid that in the future
[08:51:19] <causative> that is the essence of intelligence
[08:51:40] <causative> and it's better than a thousand years of human coders building spaghetti code to their heart's content
[08:51:44] <I_Am_M00t> the network intrinsically has spatial awareness, and broad features like edges are learned
[08:52:01] <ProfSimm> I've seen naive ANN and how they learn to read text for example. Internally it's a mess, and it falls apart in unexpected circumstances. You can't just throw your hands in the air and let God do it for you through training
[08:52:10] <ProfSimm> You still need to structure that network for a purpose
[08:52:14] <ProfSimm> Only some layers are opaque
[08:52:22] <I_Am_M00t> yes ProfSimm, that's why it's built with spatial awareness in mind
[08:52:44] <ProfSimm> Well...
[08:52:45] <causative> you don't manually choose the weights
[08:53:02] <I_Am_M00t> ProfSimm: CNNs for instance, they use filters and what not
[08:53:13] <ProfSimm> "spatial awareness" includes things like edge detection outputs, scale invariance layers, rotation invarianve layers and so on
[08:53:13] <I_Am_M00t> those filters are "spatial", 2D awareness
[08:53:18] <causative> you choose the network structure- and actually manually doing that is not so good either, neural architecture search is superior to human efforts
[08:53:18] <I_Am_M00t> no it doesn't ProfSimm
[08:53:29] <I_Am_M00t> the edge detection is learned based on training
[08:53:49] <I_Am_M00t> edge detection may not be learned for some tasks
[08:53:50] <ProfSimm> We're talking past each other
[08:54:12] <I_Am_M00t> well however you want to put it, some of those filters get specialized to detect "edges", for example
[08:54:12] <ProfSimm> It's not learned OR structured and guided. It's both
[08:54:27] <I_Am_M00t> but only if it's deemed necessary for a specific task
[08:54:38] <causative> human coders have a very low bitrate
[08:54:46] <I_Am_M00t> intrinsically the algorithm has "spatial awareness" (but not edge detection)
[08:54:53] <causative> 10 lines of code per day is often cited for business programmers, probably it's lower for GOFAI coders
[08:55:10] <causative> meanwhile the brain has 86 billion neurons, trillions of synapses
[08:55:39] <I_Am_M00t> convoluuuutions
[08:55:39] <causative> it would take a lot of programmers to manually generate that level of system complexity
[08:55:45] <causative> it would take them a long time
[08:56:06] <causative> and once they'd done it the system wouldn't work, because they fundamentally don't know what they're doing
[08:56:53] <causative> only an automatic, self-organizing, self-correcting principle can generate that level of complexity and make it all work together
[08:58:10] <causative> remember that the brain can still function despite constant damage and loss of neurons and errors - the brain thrives on these things, it adapts to unexpected circumstances and grows around them, like a root growing around a stone
[08:58:35] <causative> imagine you were to delete a few bytes in any given manually written program. Result: disaster.
[08:59:00] <causative> that alone tells you there's something fundamentally different going on in the brain, compared to a manually written program
[08:59:01] <ProfSimm> Humans: took 4.6 billion years and Earth-sized Earth to evolve. Also humans: actually we have no idea what we're doing I propose we simulate mass coin flipping and evolve car drivers.
[08:59:19] <ProfSimm> causative: you're let's say sliiiiiiiiightly underestimating how "engineered" we are
[08:59:58] <causative> all the engineering in the world doesn't count for shit if you don't have a self-correcting principle to automatically detect and try to correct for errors
[09:00:02] <ProfSimm> causative: another hilarious thing, sorry to say, but for a human to call their own intelligence "general". We're not general intelligence.
[09:00:20] <ProfSimm> We're human intelligence. We're doing good, but we don't need this mess in a car.
[09:00:35] <causative> maybe we don't need it in a car but we do need it in an AGI
[09:01:09] <causative> general intelligence is "General problem-solving ability."  The ability to wrangle with an unexpected, unknown problem, and eventually figure out how it works and solve it successfully.
[09:01:12] <ProfSimm> Well we waited 4.6 billion years, you'll wait a few more decades to get there with silicon
[09:01:50] <causative> humans can do that
[09:01:54] <causative> computers can't, yet
[09:01:55] <ProfSimm> causative: your own definition looks genetic engineering problem solving algorithms to seem more "general" than us
[09:02:06] <ProfSimm> causative: why do we make worse antennas than a Windows 7 PC
[09:02:08] <ProfSimm> You tell me
[09:02:15] <ProfSimm> If we're such amazing problem solvers
[09:02:34] <causative> well, genetic algorithms are "general" but they're just not that great at it, except in certain carefully human-curated domains
[09:02:51] <causative> the antenna-designing program can't design a spoon or a Cuisinart
[09:02:59] <ProfSimm> We're tool makers and meme reproducers.
[09:03:06] <ProfSimm> We're not that "general" otherwise
[09:03:13] <ProfSimm> So we build tools, that's good.
[09:03:24] <causative> it takes general intelligence to be what we are
[09:03:45] <ProfSimm> causative: again, calling it general in light of what our own tools are surpassing us at is kinda unfounded.
[09:03:48] <ProfSimm> I know it's the term.
[09:04:11] <causative> so far, our tools surpass us by being special-purpose
[09:04:21] <ProfSimm> Well... yeah?
[09:04:24] <causative> a lever is special purpose, and it can be stronger than a human in the right circumstances
[09:04:42] <causative> a lever is useful, but it's not smart like us
[09:04:42] <ProfSimm> Where would society be if we realized on our general purpose transportation only (i.e. walking)
[09:04:48] <ProfSimm> relied*
[09:04:57] <causative> certainly, it is good to make special-purpose tools?
[09:05:03] <causative> who said otherwise?
[09:05:23] <causative> but AGI is a general-purpose tool
[09:05:35] <ProfSimm> causative: well you dismissing how AI for driving is built as if it the goal should be creating silicon Shakespeare, and not a driving software.
[09:05:59] <causative> not Shakespeare, but an ideal artificial scientist
[09:06:08] <causative> science is something that takes general intelligence
[09:06:21] <causative> in a sense, science is the absolute essence of general intelligence
[09:06:28] <I_Am_M00t> lol
[09:06:28] <causative> AIXI is a "scientist" - and a general intelligence
[09:06:38] <I_Am_M00t> this convo tho
[09:06:46] <causative> it forms theories and tests them
[09:07:12] <ProfSimm> I have no clue why I'm arguing about car software at all.
[09:07:25] <ProfSimm> The initial debate was Delf asking "why should I care about others"
[09:07:39] <causative> so you can learn their weaknesses
[09:07:53] <ProfSimm> General intelligence ^
[09:08:51] <ProfSimm> causative: I hope you realize, to a hypothetical intelligent alien, 99% of what we do is stupid as shit.
[09:09:16] <ProfSimm> I don't mean genius alien, just one who hasn't grown up to watch reality TV and sports for example
[09:09:21] <I_Am_M00t> ProfSimm: to a hypothetical person, 99.999% is dum dum :D
[09:09:26] <I_Am_M00t> lol, why you need an alien?
[09:09:39] <I_Am_M00t> to an old grandma mindin her own business, it's dumb
[09:09:40] <ProfSimm> I'm trying to express someone who is detached from our culture
[09:09:49] <I_Am_M00t> yeah, try a grandma, it'll make the point better
[09:09:59] <ProfSimm> Because as I said, we mostly reproduce our own stupidity and make tools.
[09:10:02] <ProfSimm> That's us
[09:10:09] <I_Am_M00t> we're dum dums
[09:10:14] <I_Am_M00t> who think we smart smarts
[09:10:24] <ProfSimm> You speak the true true
[09:10:28] <I_Am_M00t> mythology machines
[09:10:34] <I_Am_M00t> primarily
[09:10:53] <I_Am_M00t> but some people has as part of their mythology, that we are truth machines
[09:11:05] <I_Am_M00t> so there's funny layer of mythology, that prevents the mythology from being seen :D
[09:11:17] <I_Am_M00t> this is the essence of intelligence :D
[09:11:26] <I_Am_M00t> "do not see that which is"
[09:11:39] <I_Am_M00t> "see what you believe"
[09:13:30] <I_Am_M00t> if the greatest power humans have is not collective myth, then i have learned nothing about humanity
[09:13:33] *** Siegfried is now known as Panther
[09:13:35] <ProfSimm> We have a symbol of life called the Ouroboros. A snake eating its tail.
[09:14:03] <ProfSimm> This is basically our subconscious trying to tell us we're way way deep up our own asses.
[09:14:11] <I_Am_M00t> lol
[09:14:26] <I_Am_M00t> best not disturb the beehive
[09:14:35] <I_Am_M00t> people get violent when you tell them they don't know what's up
[09:15:06] <I_Am_M00t> "you telling me God is NOT real???" "you telling me SCIENCE is not the alpha and omeGA??!"

[22:31:32] <mycroftiv> 'mom' to me than actual mom is, but i love her too. my dad was both a lot 'softer' and did more of the life-teaching, tho i sure ended upwith a skewed body of starting knowledge
[22:32:04] <mycroftiv> i am hoping that technology advances to the point i can talk my simulated-father in VR before too many more years
[22:32:46] <mycroftiv> i already know about how to make something like this work, but the setup is quite elaborate. probably people are working on it inside the BigCorp labs where we only are told what they think is to their benefit to let us know
[22:34:00] <mycroftiv> i have this current problem in life where i have done a lot of work that might benefit these research programs a bit, but im not a 'sign this NDA and well have a chunk your soul on the side fpr security' type
[22:34:57] <mycroftiv> but the people im communication with all are worried that ill decide to tell all my -cough-secrets-cough to the Other Side so they keep kind of stringing me along
[22:35:32] <mycroftiv> hoping their own internal researchers will figure out the missing pieces i have in my weird brain and pile of work without having to work with me, since i will say that we have to collaborate with the Other Guys in a fair way
[22:36:11] <mycroftiv> and theyd rather finish the blueprints for the tech and get the patent and release the products all under their controlled legal brand with govt guns backing up the monopoly
[22:37:14] <mycroftiv> and its not just the fucking corpos and govts, its all players in the Big Game that see things are a cusp, and know they have to play fair with all eyes watching, but still have some hope for a last minute double-triple cross to get stuff all under their control
[22:37:41] <mycroftiv> im a fucking pawn in the game, but im close to the last Rank
[22:37:52] <mycroftiv> and i dont want to become fucking King
[22:38:24] <mycroftiv> power and responsibility? fuck no. but Power exists and flows, and someone has to work the tooling to keep it from being too Shocking
[22:39:46] <mycroftiv> (for those baffled by the fact that you promote pawns to Queens, not Kings...that is some Deep Encryption Namespace Tooling, And Really The Heavy Users Realize.
[22:40:58] <mycroftiv> i willa also decrypt my signals on request if im layering too many symbols in my baklava of words
