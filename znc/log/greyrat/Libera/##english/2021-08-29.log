[01:05:43] <StayHungry> well, minorities not only get engaged in bizarre bonding acts (with animals, rocks, sex dolls, even themselves, etc), but now demand to call it a marriage (instead of a union), and this inevitably creates a problem with the classic document flow, oriented to the needs of the majority.

[01:15:02] <StayHungry> and those who encourage such self-indulgent redefining wordplay, forget (unknowingly or deliberately) that marriage is a union for the sake of nurturing the next generation, not only 'love and commitment', i.e. not just a private isolated matter, but a social unit. so instead of raising tensions and messing with the classic schemata, it would be worth developing a workflow focused on civil unions that encompasses all those deviations

[18:15:06] <AmalLight> hi to all
[18:15:13] <AmalLight> *hello to all
[18:15:41] <AmalLight> I am writing letter of presentation for work in Europe , can i ask you if I will have need to find correct forms for some phrases ?
[18:16:03] <AmalLight> my english is not perfect , for that i am asking you that
[18:16:47] <AmalLight> *I am asking you this pleasure 
[18:20:17] <blkshp> Hello. What are you trying to say with that?
[18:20:32] <blkshp> Please give complete sentences and the context for the examples
[18:23:17] <AmalLight> oh yes in general i have certification of B2 for english
[18:23:27] <AmalLight> so i can't speak very well
[18:23:40] <blkshp> English* :)
[18:23:57] <AmalLight> as original English person for example 
[18:24:02] <AmalLight> yes exactly
[18:24:26] <AmalLight> *like original English person
[18:24:49] <blkshp> "So I don't speak as well as a native English person"
[18:25:31] <AmalLight> now i will try to make you an example of my typical indecision 
[18:25:46] * blkshp awaits it
[18:25:54] <AmalLight> oh yes i don't , right
[18:26:21] <AmalLight>  I am working as *** in ** with a indefinitely contract <-- is it a correct phrase ?
[18:26:35] <blkshp> That's what practice is for. Try to capitalise "I" when you refer to yourself and not leave spaces before punctuation marks.
[18:26:42] <blkshp> No.
[18:27:05] <AmalLight> mm ok
[18:27:08] <blkshp> Context.
[18:27:30] <AmalLight> oh yes but you want see all letter ?
[18:27:37] <AmalLight> *do you want to see
[18:27:58] <blkshp> "...all of the letter?"
[18:28:17] <blkshp> Not really, I want you to set the scene around your statement.
[18:28:40] <blkshp> Tell me what it's saying, why are you using it? where are you using it? and for what purpose.
[18:28:45] <AmalLight> i was interesting to understand if << with a indefinitely contract >> it's a correct way for explain my contract situation

[18:29:04] <AmalLight> because i want to make clear that i am searching new opportunity
[18:29:15] <AmalLight> but i already have good work
[18:29:19] <AmalLight> and salary
[18:29:37] <blkshp> Is it normal wherever you are to be that specific about your current employment?
[18:29:57] <blkshp> and if it's current, it's "I am" not "I was"
[18:30:10] <blkshp> I am currently employed with a permanent contract
[18:30:45] <AmalLight> oh yes so from <<  I am working as Developer in Bologna (IT) with a indefinitely contract . >>
[18:30:54] <AmalLight> it will become
[18:31:19] <AmalLight> I am currently working as Developer in Bologna (IT) with a permanent contract ?
[18:31:19] <blkshp> You cannot say "an indefinitely contract"
[18:31:33] <AmalLight> blkshp i found it in google
[18:31:34] <AmalLight> XD
[18:31:40] <AmalLight> google translation
[18:31:43] <AmalLight> ahah
[18:31:59] <blkshp> You're wanting "permanent"
[18:32:32] <AmalLight> yes i like it
[18:32:36] <blkshp> ...working as a developer...
[18:32:42] <Oleg> Guys, I have this sentence: "One is run by an evil empire that wants total control over everything you say and do and if you don't perfectly toe the party line they banish you to a gulag."
[18:32:46] <AmalLight> it's more clearly and simple 
[18:32:59] <Oleg> is it supposed to be "toe" or "tow" in that sentence?
[18:33:19] <blkshp> tow
[18:33:47] <Oleg> you're certain?
[18:33:55] <blkshp> Yes
[18:34:09] <Oleg> okay
[18:34:15] <blkshp> Wait
[18:34:31] <blkshp> Oleg: I am completely wrong.
[18:34:56] <blkshp> It is apparently to toe the line because you are not stepping past the line that has been set out.
[18:35:06] <blkshp> I was almost positive but had to look it up
[18:35:19] <TechTest> that's true, you are wrong 
[18:35:33] <blkshp> I am wrong, but unlike some I have no problem admitting it :P
[18:35:49] <Oleg> so, "tow" would not even make sense in that sentence?
[18:36:20] <blkshp> Well it does, but only if, like me you didn't understand the etymology of the idiom.
[18:36:36] <TechTest> I had no idea what the conversation is about :P
[18:38:01] <Oleg> blkshp: but the idiom is "toe the line", not "toe the party line".

[18:42:27] <AmalLight> is more correct say << i suggest you to following the link >> or <<  i suggest you to follow the link >>
[18:42:36] <AmalLight> or to click on the link
[18:42:46] <AmalLight> for Linkedin i meant

[18:44:36] <AmalLight> no no dear , i want to say that i will attach my cv.pdf on email
[18:44:55] <pussipupu> "toe the party line" is a fairly common idiom
[18:45:03] <AmalLight> and i will write linkedin link directly in email
[18:45:24] <AmalLight> TechTest perfect
[18:45:38] <AmalLight> and clear , very simple also
[18:45:42] <TechTest> "attach link" you don't also need tell them to click it

[18:46:03] <AmalLight> TechTest yes they are not idiots
[18:46:07] <AmalLight> XD  .
[18:47:05] <TechTest> AmalLight: also your first sentence needs some corrections

[18:47:15] <blkshp> Stop putting spaces before punctuation AmalLight.
[18:47:44] <blkshp> Not when writing in English anyway.
[18:47:45] <TechTest> "To make it easier for you to identify me..."
[18:48:05] <Oleg> blkshp: ?
[18:48:05] <TechTest> what spaces?
[18:48:30] <AmalLight> exactly i don't understand

[18:49:26] <Oleg> blkshp: as an idiom, it wouldn't make sense to say "tow the party line" to mean drag the party line?
[18:50:07] <blkshp> AmalLight: "... clear , very..." "... XD  ."
[18:50:42] <Oleg> blkshp: this question is in reference to that sentence.
[18:51:16] <blkshp> Oleg: I think we've established what the correct term is. It would be understaood and likely no one would care it was the wrong spelling but it would be wrong.
[18:51:27] <pussipupu> It's not clear what "drag the party line" would mean, and "tow the party line" would probably be generally interpreted as a corruption of "toe the party line" so probably not
[18:51:34] <blkshp> Also, what would mean by dragging it
[18:51:37] <blkshp> Exactly.
[18:52:17] <Oleg> okay, got it

[21:28:58] <lall-> steamed cabbage gives you awful farts though.
[21:29:21] <blkshp> Only if you eat a bucket of it.

[21:32:01] <lall-> becaue it's fermented.
[21:32:17] <lall-> even though they are carnivores.

[21:33:28] <blkshp> "...a few days..."
[21:33:29] <lall-> and i enjoy it. i hate veggies, but i do like my fermented veggies.
[21:33:44] <lall-> i make my own.
[21:33:58] <blkshp> Fermented grapes are good.

[21:35:03] <blkshp> I was thinking more wine but ok.
[21:35:24] <lall-> there's a drink called "Loza", it's fermented grapes, actually, distilled.
[21:36:11] <lall-> popular in Croatia.
[21:36:23] <blkshp> I mostly have Gin, Whiskey, Wine
[21:36:36] <blkshp> Or cocktails, I make cocktails sometimes.
[21:37:24] <lall-> whiskey good too, if made in scotland. they have laws what you can add to it (the only thing you can add to scotish whiskey is coloring)
[21:37:41] <blkshp> If it's Scottish it's Whisky not Whiskey.
[21:37:57] <blkshp> Also, if it's Scotland it's colouring.
[21:37:58] <huf> so anal.
[21:38:12] <blkshp> Rude.
[21:38:42] <lall-> well, i'm a serb, so... i ought to have some leeway.
[21:38:52] <huf> and if it's not from the Whisky region of Scotland, it's just a sparkling hammer to the face
[21:39:39] <blkshp> lall-: You get leeway by the fact i don't whine at you for no capital letters on place names, not capitalising "I"

[21:40:01] <lall-> that's just because i'm not in an embassy writing a formal document :)
[21:40:25] <blkshp> But you are on a channel that's designed for people to learn how to correctly use English not a chat down the pub.
[21:40:37] <lall-> True.
[21:40:38] <huf> it's clearly both
[21:40:50] <blkshp> Though we do allow and even encourage "chat down the pub" I still do usually expect it to be properly spelled.
[21:42:10] <lall-> This is how I look at it. Breaking the rules implies friendship. So I can tell you "fuck you", and if you're my friend you'll just laught at it. If you are a stranger, we gonna have a problem. You know, intent.
[21:42:16] <lall-> Now, I'm not arguing against your point
[21:42:34] <lall-> Just saying that... friendliness implies... well... being soft with rules.
[21:43:19] <lall-> If its mandated strictly official, that's fine too.
[21:44:48] <lall-> that's the "chat down the pub" mentality.
[21:46:06] <blkshp> Now, to a point I concur. You can say "fuck you" to me and I will interpret it because I know you on here and have done for some time so take it as a joke. However, the rules of the channel take precedent. If you (or whoever) continue to break the rules of the channel and, follwing being asked frankly to not do it, then we'd have an issue. The primary function of the channel is still English.
[21:46:07] <lall-> i'm down the pub kind of a guy :)
[21:46:37] <lall-> If yu tell me "frankly" you don't want me to do something, I will be alright with that.
[21:46:44] <blkshp> I know :)
[21:47:26] <blkshp> So I would appreciate if you tried to capitalise where required.
[21:47:54] <blkshp> It's not just a point for here, why not capitalise properly everywhere, what's the harm?

[22:58:46] <blkshp> Whence do you hale?
[22:58:59] <blkshp> hail*
[22:59:09] <blkshp> WHENCE I SAY.
[22:59:25] <lall-> Few years back, I met a guy from south of England, started riffing on about Serbs being monsters and killing muslims. And I'm like, dude... I was born in 85. I nver killed anybody.
[23:01:11] <blkshp> Well people are stupid, you just have to do your best to ignore them.
[23:01:13] <lall-> So certain people have an image of you irrevelvant of your person. So, who I am, and where I'm from? it doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is if I'm a stand up guy or a cunt.
[23:01:18] <blkshp> No such comments are allowed here.
[23:01:44] <blkshp> Well we know the answer to that irregardless don't we ;D
[23:03:39] <lall-> Sure. Just don't ask my wife :)

[23:20:58] <TechTest> I was actually serious
[23:21:14] <blkshp> Oh, do you have "serious" modes?
[23:21:16] <blkshp> xD
[23:21:16] <TechTest> you may reduce caffeine, it makes you irritable
[23:21:25] <blkshp> I've only had one today.

[23:23:23] <TechTest> that's correct
[23:23:32] <TechTest> so are you cutting coffee?
[23:23:36] <blkshp> Chief George Earl.
[23:23:47] <TechTest> who's that?
[23:25:29] <blkshp> Demolition Man Reference.
[23:27:31] <lall-> Can't respect anybody that doesn't reckognize demolition man references though.
[23:27:33] <TechTest> was it a bad or good thing?
[23:27:58] <TechTest> I mean, in what world would you say something good about me? :P
[23:28:01] <blkshp> Now all restaurants are pizza hut
[23:28:08] * blkshp cries at the poor dubbing.
[23:28:12] <TechTest> pizza hut sucks
[23:28:56] <blkshp> I do say good things about you when you do something good.
[23:29:32] <TechTest>  I do too
[23:29:41] <TechTest> blkshp: you are very good in English

[23:29:54] <TechTest> damn 
[23:30:21] <TechTest> my intention was correct, even though my grammar wasn't :P
[23:31:23] <blkshp> lall-: Would it be too much if i added this into an alias?  BzZzZ <nick> You are fined one credit for a violation of the verbal morality statute.
[23:33:21] <lall-> only if you need to use the toilet and don't udnersnd the 3 shells.
[23:34:08] <blkshp> Maybe that will be explained if the sequel happens.

Well, I can't believe 'I can't believe it's not butter' is not butter and, I can't believe the stuff I can't believe is not 'I can't believe it's not butter' isn't actually butter. And they may actually both be butter in a cunning disguise.
