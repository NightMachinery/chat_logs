[13:38:51] <OnkelTem> Hi all
[13:39:56] <OnkelTem> I have a mini server at home I would like to use as a tor "access point"
[13:40:32] <OnkelTem> I don't use tor all the time, but I would like to run it 24x7 to allow other people to use it
[13:40:56] <OnkelTem> oops, not "use" really, bad phrasing
[13:41:24] <OnkelTem> What one starts tor contraptions, it servers as a transport for Tor traffic, does it?
[13:41:30] <DJKuhpisse> So you like that others can connect to it via the SOCKS proxy of TOR?
[13:41:35] <OnkelTem> no no
[13:41:50] <OnkelTem> the second phrase :)
[13:42:02] <OnkelTem> s/What/When/
[13:42:09] <DJKuhpisse> Please explain more precisely
[13:42:46] <OnkelTem> Ok. I imagine it this way. I run tor service and it works all the time, providing transport for the tor network
[13:43:26] <OnkelTem> and sometimes I myself use it. I just want to make tor better and ready to run the service for free all the time
[13:43:42] <OnkelTem> and I wonder is it enough just to run tor service to get it done?
[13:44:31] <OnkelTem> I want to spare some bandwidth on my home router for that as well
[13:46:44] <OnkelTem> relay! that's the word. I want to setup a relay
[13:47:15] <OnkelTem> I think I should read this: https://community.torproject.org/relay/
[13:58:40] <OnkelTem> DJKuhpisse: is there a book on Tor? :)
[13:58:55] <OnkelTem> Such a shiny idea just come to my mind :)
[13:59:44] <OnkelTem> for tech guys
[13:59:51] *** Joins: _inky (~inky_@46.36.112.208)
[14:14:41] <Atque> OnkelTem: You could ToS features and VLANs to set aside bandwidth I guess. Ideally, you would want someone with network admin experience to help you do that
[14:22:25] <DJKuhpisse> You can operate a relay at home if you like.
[14:22:30] <DJKuhpisse> I also do it.

[14:29:42] <OnkelTem> Cool!
[14:29:59] <OnkelTem> Atque: I have some experience and own a decent router which should be enough 
[14:30:17] <OnkelTem> one of those mikrotik things-in-themselves lol
[14:30:37] <OnkelTem> haven't learned how to configure it for years %)
[14:40:26] <Atque> OnkelTem: Yeah, it's good to look at tbh... good to update firmware on routers and managed switches now and then
[15:01:45] *** Joins: TheHermann (~TheHerman@gateway/tor-sasl/thehermann)
[15:03:41] <OnkelTem> I have a question. Reading the manual I came across this: "there aren't many bridge users out there, so you cannot expect your bridge to be as popular as a relay."
[15:03:59] <OnkelTem> why is that - "ain't many bridge users out there"?
[15:04:21] <OnkelTem> Does one need to do some configuration to reach bridges?
[15:04:46] <OnkelTem> Aren't they just added to the regular circuits automatically?
[15:05:19] <OnkelTem> (I'd like to start with a brige)
[15:09:50] <OnkelTem> it was here: https://community.torproject.org/relay/setup/bridge/post-install/
[15:24:39] *** Joins: _inky (~inky_@46.36.112.208)
[15:27:15] <OnkelTem> Also, I wonder is that many connections as 7000+ I need to be able to provide to run a bridge?
[15:27:35] <OnkelTem> From here: there aren't many bridge users out there, so you cannot expect your bridge to be as popular as a relay.
[15:27:40] <OnkelTem> oops
[15:27:45] <OnkelTem> https://community.torproject.org/relay/relays-requirements/
[15:48:14] <Atque> OnkelTem: It depends on your OS a bit. Windows only has 5,000 or so ephermal ports, afaik.
