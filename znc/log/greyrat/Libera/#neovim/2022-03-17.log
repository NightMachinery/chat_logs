[00:00:17] <sunjonSenghanBri> good lord
[00:00:50] <smolck> https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg and https://github.com/nvim-orgmode/orgmode are the main ones I know of

[00:03:02] <mjlbach[m]> jensen: don't trust anyone claiming soft statistics like that
[00:03:09] <mjlbach[m]> there's nothing inherently about emacs that would make it scale poorly to a large codebase
[00:03:27] <mjlbach[m]> e.g, lsp-mode (for example) should scale just as well as any other language server plugin
[00:03:44] <smolck> mjlbach[m]: is this true though? in practice doesn't elisp become a bottleneck?
[00:03:51] <sunjonSenghanBri> "other people's claims" are generally going to not fare well thoughout the entire process
[00:04:02] <mjlbach[m]> No
[00:04:03] <mjlbach[m]> Emacs is fine
[00:04:26] <smolck> I never said it wasn't but I thought it just generally was more of a bloated/larger beast than neovim
[00:04:27] <jensen> i mean they are willing to live with the consequences, so it does put some value to their words
[00:04:33] <jensen> they are Emacs users
[00:04:39] <jensen> lifelong
[00:04:41] <mjlbach[m]> elisp is slower than luajit/javascript, but not by orders of magnitude, and all of the lsp stuff is pretty lightweight anyways except for the json serialization/deserialization which is done in c anyways
[00:04:57] <mjlbach[m]> I would just use both and see what you like
[00:05:08] <mjlbach[m]> With evil there is not much difference
[00:05:24] <smolck> spacemacs was pretty cool to me when I tried it, ngl
[00:05:34] <wastrel> looks like neorg isn't cross compatible with orgmode
[00:06:06] <smolck> yeah it's its own thing
[00:06:20] <smolck> but takes inspiration (fairly heavily?) from orgmode
[00:06:32] <sunjonSenghanBri> shadowwolf_01:matrix.org: have you used it?
[00:06:36] <sunjonSenghanBri> I'm assuming not
[00:06:44] <smolck> neorg? nah
[00:06:48] <sunjonSenghanBri> this is my point
[00:06:49] <mjlbach[m]> wastrel: then use orgmode.nvim
[00:06:57] <sunjonSenghanBri> about this question
[00:07:13] <sunjonSenghanBri> and especially re: the followup "if you do your own research - come tell me!"
[00:07:17] <smolck> I just gave an example of what they wanted, the two I was familiar with, I didn't offer my experience on the thing
[00:07:35] <sunjonSenghanBri> it always results in a circlejerk regurgitation of elisp/emacs/blah blah
[00:07:56] <sunjonSenghanBri> with zero contribution to an actual discussion about the original topic
[00:08:23] <mjlbach[m]> sunjonSenghanBri: lol yes
[00:08:29] <nmattia[m]> > <@nmattia:matrix.org> hi there, does anyone know if I can pass Lua function references to viml? It appears that `vim.fn()` silently converts functions to `vim.NIL`, and the `vim.fn()` doc suggests that "all types" will be converted back and forth:... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/899e2427892c6161e9bfdedaeb1a161b968b542b)
[00:08:36] <sunjonSenghanBri> the likelyhood of there being even a handful of people present at the same time, that have used both orgmode orig, and a neovim equiv is literally zilch
[00:08:49] <sunjonSenghanBri> and asking here is illogical
[00:08:53] <mjlbach[m]> I have used both extensively fwiw
[00:09:20] <sunjonSenghanBri> google throws up both your suggestions, reddit threads, blogs by the authors  and a crap tonne of info that people have taken the time to write
[00:09:23] <sunjonSenghanBri> why avoid it?
[00:09:36] <sunjonSenghanBri> "i'll ask some random people on IRC!!"
[00:09:45] <wastrel> if you're concerned about keeping signal/noise ratio low arguing about what other people are saying talking about in channel is not a great way to improve it 
[00:09:49] <sunjonSenghanBri> "btw guis, what's your favourite theme??"
[00:10:04] <smolck> they were just asking a question lol, it's one thing if they had continually bugged with easily googleable questions
[00:10:04] <sunjonSenghanBri> my concern is illogical questions
[00:10:06] <sunjonSenghanBri> but nice try
[00:10:08] <wastrel> er, high :) 
[00:10:09] <smolck> but they weren't
[00:10:26] <smolck> a quick "hey here's some, btw you can find these on Google for future reference!" or something is much more helpful IMO
[00:10:51] <sunjonSenghanBri> something something teach a man to fish
[00:11:08] <mjlbach[m]> sunjon (Senghan Bright): I get your frustration "coc vs lspconfig", "has the neovim team ever considered rewriting in rust", "neorg vs orgmode.nvim", "what's your favorite theme", it's always the same questions and it does get old to those of us who stick around :) 
[00:11:38] <sunjonSenghanBri> I'm sure it's a thing, and my 'frustration' is the pushback reallt
[00:11:41] <sunjonSenghanBri> *really
[00:11:46] <sunjonSenghanBri> not the question
[00:12:14] <smolck> y'all gonna force me to make a !rtfm command or something? :P
[00:12:14] <jensen> anyway, what's your guy's favorite themes on nvim and emacs? 
[00:12:17] <sunjonSenghanBri> normally if there's a "heh, yeah should have googled... looks like there's quite a few!"
[00:12:36] <smolck> jensen: I'm choosing to take this as a joke, and I love it
[00:12:58] <sunjonSenghanBri> which is normally followed up in the future with them solving a couple of future problems themselves, then returning when they really have something nvim centric to ask
[00:13:22] <sunjonSenghanBri> those that we "give a man a fish", tend to predictaly ask for another fish.. and another
[00:13:36] <sunjonSenghanBri> *predictably
[00:13:47] <smolck> that's fair
[00:14:05] <jensen> i'm not asking for a fish i'm asking for a theme

[00:17:13] <smolck> and now I'm wondering if it's such that I could plug it into a GUI
[00:17:43] <sunjonSenghanBri> should be able to? at least the clock.. I don't know, I've never tried
[00:18:01] <mjlbach[m]> jensen: you can read the most recent time this question was asked (thursday) here: https://matrix.to/#/!JAfPjWAdLCtgeCAwnS:matrix.org/$164694867712605isXhE:matrix.org?via=matrix.org&via=libera.chat&via=gitter.im
[00:18:03] <sunjonSenghanBri> the menu is more complicated, as it uses external tools to get everything I needed for mouse usage
[00:18:24] <smolck> I might give it a try in . . . undetermined amount of time when I have a GUI I want to test it with :P
[00:18:53] <smolck> but that kinda takes away the coolness because it's not TUI so idk
[00:18:58] <smolck> *it wouldn't be TUI
[00:20:08] <jensen> mjlbach thank you
[00:20:26] <smolck> but yeah that's cool
[00:20:38] <mjlbach[m]> FWIW I gave a straightforward answer when it was asked :)

[00:22:47] <sunjonSenghanBri> searching github for "neovim theme" and "nvim theme", then sorting by "most stars", has a couple of false positives, but gives you:
[00:23:24] <sunjonSenghanBri> onedark, iceberg, tokyoknight, oceanic-next, tender, catpuccin
[00:23:38] <sunjonSenghanBri> does that vastly differ from the other answers?
[00:23:54] <mjlbach[m]> no
[00:23:57] <sunjonSenghanBri> like... could said man actually known how to fish all along?

[00:24:13] <smolck> hey I haven't seen this one

[00:25:12] <wastrel> i always liked molokai but papercolor looks very nice idk

[00:26:46] <jensen> sunjon link me your dotfiles i only want the theme, statusbar, and font

[00:28:33] <smolck> maybe colors but you are not bad at customization lol
[00:28:34] <mjlbach[m]> lmao asking sunjon to link you to his config is antithetical to everything he has been saying

[00:29:37] <sunjonSenghanBri> he kind of came back down the hill a bit, but his 'apprentice' theme isn't bad at all (I wouldn't use it in practice, and it's not as nice as some of the more modern stuff - but it'd certainly be a viable candidate as a new included scheme for me) - https://github.com/romainl/Apprentice

[00:30:57] <sunjonSenghanBri> I know he did sell a lot of folk on the idea, but I'm not sure how much of that was just momentum "because he does"
[00:31:33] <sunjonSenghanBri> I think a lot of popularity is momentum based
[00:31:47] <sunjonSenghanBri> I I I I, sign of the narcissist!?
[00:31:54] <mjlbach[m]> yeah the default bundled themes are awful
[00:32:03] <mjlbach[m]> We have an issue for a better theme but ofc very controversial
[00:35:16] <sunjonSenghanBri> I want to make some telescope stuff, for "non files". like modular api browsers

[00:35:57] <sunjonSenghanBri> elasticsearch. where you may want to do something with the dynamic results
[00:36:19] <sunjonSenghanBri> not just a DIY wrapper around curl, but you select modules and the api versions they target
[00:36:29] <sunjonSenghanBri> think the audience for it would be too niche?
[00:36:45] <smolck> that seems difficult/API-dependent?
[00:36:49] <wastrel> you should write it in rust
[00:37:00] <sunjonSenghanBri> I don't mind building a few of the api wrappers
[00:37:18] <sunjonSenghanBri> I would say its akin to writing lua c bindings

[03:04:13] <ii14[m]> you need to generate tags

[16:25:57] <theh> Anyone using Tree-Sitter as a daily driver with popular languages? I'm wondering if it's good enough that the vim/regex implementation is always second choice, or if there are still rough edges that keep users on the latter.
[16:26:15] <clason[m]> Certainly not, in this generality
[16:26:48] <clason[m]> Some languages (and some uses) are fine, and better than the builtin syntax
[16:26:58] <clason[m]> others very much not so
[16:27:11] <clason[m]> It's still experimental for a reason.
[16:27:54] *** Quits: henry40408 (~henry4040@123-204-9-134.dynamic.seed.net.tw) (Quit: The Lounge - https://thelounge.chat)
[16:28:22] <lewis6991[m]> FWIW i use it for everything without much issue
[16:28:31] <theh> I see. I haven't used it much yet so wasn't sure how far it has come. I know markdown (of all) is still lagging behind (wasn't even in the official list last time I checked)
[16:28:35] <clason[m]> To be honest, tree-sitter works best for things you can't do otherwise, and that are self-contained features (like comment strings in mixed languages, or https://github.com/vigoux/complementree.nvim, or https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-treehopper)
[16:29:12] <clason[m]> Markdown is pretty much the worst-case target for an AST-based highlighter
[16:29:39] <theh> Ah really? Like how regex and HTML (SGML) don't mix well? That might explain it.
[16:30:04] <clason[m]> yes, although the results are somewhat saner than full zalgo.
[16:30:31] <clason[m]> But it should be fairly solid these days.
[16:30:51] <lewis6991[m]> > Markdown is pretty much the worst-case target for an AST-based highlighter
[16:30:51] <lewis6991[m]> But when it works, it is magical in regards to language injection.
[16:30:55] <clason[m]> And, as always, it depends on how much work people put into the queries (hint, hint)
[16:31:01] <clason[m]> > <@lewis6991:matrix.org> > Markdown is pretty much the worst-case target for an AST-based highlighter
[16:31:01] <clason[m]> > 
[16:31:01] <clason[m]> > But when it works, it is magical in regards to language injection.
[16:31:01] <clason[m]> true.
[16:31:14] <clason[m]> that is by far the biggest advantage of tree-sitter
[16:31:19] <clason[m]> (in this context)
[16:32:56] <lewis6991[m]> maybe we should give up with markdown treesitter and just enable language injection in regexp-syntax
[16:33:11] <lewis6991[m]> * just enable ts language injection
[16:33:26] <clason[m]> I don't think you can mix and match (currently)
[16:33:39] <clason[m]> it's not impossible, conceptually, but would require significant changes
[16:34:30] <clason[m]> in particular in the old syntax engine, which nobody likes to touch ;)
[16:35:07] <clason[m]> (as you then need to make it skip the parts belonging to tree-sitter)
[16:35:12] *** Joins: arkurious (~arkurious@user/arkurious)
[16:37:35] <lewis6991[m]> as far as I understand, ts just sits on top and can be enabled for any region, it's just detecting the regions is the problem
[16:38:00] <clason[m]> so you'll have the region highlighted twice?
[16:38:07] <lewis6991[m]> yep
[16:38:11] <clason[m]> ah
[16:38:12] <clason[m]> not ideal
[16:38:24] <lewis6991[m]> that was (and might still be the case) for quite a few languages
[16:38:25] <clason[m]> but doable
[16:38:33] <lewis6991[m]> it's opt-in to disable both for some languages
[16:38:41] <lewis6991[m]> unless that's changed since I last checked
[16:38:51] <clason[m]> well, no; it's just possible to enable it (have both highlighters active at the same time)
[16:39:02] * lewis6991[m] sent a require code block: https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/897b1857a742f31cd5311ffc1c701e1576cbf441
[16:39:10] <clason[m]> but it's definitely opt-in (and globally)
[16:39:15] <clason[m]> yeah, that's the default
[16:39:19] <clason[m]> (`false`)
[16:39:24] <lewis6991[m]> ah good, it wasn't at some point
[16:39:37] <clason[m]> that must have been a bug then ;)
[16:39:57] <lewis6991[m]> I thought some languages have it default on
[16:40:01] <clason[m]> nope
[16:40:07] <clason[m]> it's a global option, too
[16:40:12] <lewis6991[m]> I only know because I needed to explicitly disable it for spellsitter
[16:40:30] <clason[m]> ah, no, it can be a list as well. never mind
[16:40:32] <lewis6991[m]> since the old engine did the spell higlights "properly"
[16:40:56] <clason[m]> yup
[16:41:28] <lewis6991[m]> Either way, for some langs, we can use the old engine as a simple first pass and use language injection for trickier parts
[16:41:33] <lewis6991[m]> markdown would work well for that
[16:41:44] <clason[m]> possibly.
[16:42:07] <clason[m]> but it'd be nicer if we could also disable (skip) regions for regex highlighting
[16:42:28] <lewis6991[m]> the old engine essentially allows that
[16:42:32] <lewis6991[m]> with `CONTAINS`
[16:42:59] <clason[m]> so basically you have to highjack that
[16:43:26] <lewis6991[m]> well for markdown, code blocks wouldn't contain any other regexp syntax groups
[16:43:32] <lewis6991[m]> and we just to ts instead
[16:43:43] <clason[m]> s/highjack/hijack/
[16:43:59] <lewis6991[m]> s/to/do/
[16:44:15] <lewis6991[m]> Same for html
[16:44:27] <lewis6991[m]> the old engine can just handle titles and whatnot
[16:44:33] <lewis6991[m]> which is hard for ts
[16:44:42] <clason[m]> but for Markdown, what is currently borked with TS?
[16:44:58] <clason[m]> titles etc. worked fine, last time I checked
[16:45:01] <lewis6991[m]> I don't know, I just hear people say ts isn't a good fit for it
[16:45:11] <lewis6991[m]> which I could understand
[16:45:14] <clason[m]> people say a lot of things without bothering to check...
[16:45:54] <lewis6991[m]> Well given how LR parsers work, I could see why markdown would be a bit tricky
[16:46:05] <lewis6991[m]> and regexps being a better fit
[16:46:13] <clason[m]> it is, but the current parser seems to do a pretty good job nonetheless
[16:46:27] <lewis6991[m]> but how many loops is it jumping though to do that?
[16:46:33] <clason[m]> Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[16:46:43] <clason[m]> not my problem :]
[16:47:00] <clason[m]> but these:  https://github.com/MDeiml/tree-sitter-markdown/blob/main/src/scanner.cc
[16:47:00] <lewis6991[m]> ha
[16:47:17] <lewis6991[m]> just saying, md perf is a problem for ts and it wasn't for the old engine
[16:48:34] <lewis6991[m]> scanner.cc: 1012 lines, markdown.vim: 169 lines
[16:48:51] <clason[m]> sure, but one generates an AST, the other just paints as it goes along
[16:49:06] <lewis6991[m]> exactly, do we need an AST for md?
[16:49:09] <lewis6991[m]> or want
[16:49:17] <clason[m]> depends on what you want to do
[16:49:21] <lewis6991[m]> sure
[16:49:29] <clason[m]> I always hold that tree-sitter is wasted on highlighting
[16:49:40] <clason[m]> it's not where the exciting stuff happens
[16:49:42] <bfredl> at least having the code blocks parsed out is needed to support nested languages inside .md
[16:50:05] <bfredl> highlighting is just the gateway drug :]
[16:50:16] <lewis6991[m]> that's kind of what the discussion is about, can we have ts injection with the old syntax engine?
[16:50:34] <clason[m]> (and I'd like to see some actual benchmarks and examples for the slow markdown parsing, not just anecdotal reports)
[16:51:35] <lewis6991[m]> syn region markdownCode matchgroup=markdownCodeDelimiter start="`" end="`" keepend contains=markdownLineStart
[16:51:35] <lewis6991[m]> syn region markdownCode matchgroup=markdownCodeDelimiter start="`` \=" end=" \=``" keepend contains=markdownLineStart
[16:51:35] <lewis6991[m]> syn region markdownCode matchgroup=markdownCodeDelimiter start="^\s*````*.*$" end="^\s*````*\ze\s*$" keepend
[16:51:35] <bfredl> lewis6991[m]: not sure directly, but one could define ad-hoc rules just for .md which doesn't require an AST for md
[16:51:49] <lewis6991[m]> we just need injection on the `markdownCode` syntax group
[16:53:07] <bfredl> and how complicated is that? is it a single regex or is defined as syntax groups inside syntax groups etc etc?
[16:54:49] <lewis6991[m]> seems more complicated than it needs to be, but with ts injection I think some of it can be removed
[16:56:01] <bfredl> basically what I am suggesting is that we something like that, but not needing to bring in the syntax.c jet engine into the algorithm.
[16:56:52] <bfredl> if the start and end of code-blocks can be defined as (non-multiline) regexes, it could be implemented in lua using `vim.regex` both quite simply and performantly (as only changed lines need to be evaluated)
[16:57:10] <clason[m]> would also be nice to decouple the syntax engine and the highlighter somehow, so you can use syntax features (like conceal) without highlighting (which is handled by tree-sitter)
[16:58:27] <aerocn[m]> hi
[16:58:34] <lewis6991[m]> bfredl: I see. Well I think we need the notion of opaque regions to support something like \``` `text` ```
[16:58:42] <lewis6991[m]> s/\```/```/, s/`/\`/, s/`/\`/
[16:58:44] <bfredl> I discussed conceal a bit with vig. at least bringing tree-sitter support for conceal to the same level as syntax.c could be done without any major convolutions (just that neither me or him has Done the Work yet :P)
[16:58:54] <lewis6991[m]> s/\``` `/`\`/, s/`/\``/, s/```/*god dam matrix/
[16:59:22] <bfredl> I was thinking only triple-tick multiline regions for now
[16:59:25] <clason[m]> on what level would that handle the actual concealing?
[16:59:47] <bfredl> it would actually conceal stuff, the same way as `matchaddpos` can.
[16:59:56] <bfredl> (not sure if that is an answer to your question)
[17:00:01] <clason[m]> kinda
[17:00:33] <clason[m]> leaves me still fuzzy on the details, but that's fine -- I don't need to know it in more detail
[17:00:37] <bfredl> conceal is not really "coupled" to syntax.c it is mainly coupled to some arbitrary restrictions (only `Conceal` hl group, no reflow, etc etc)
[17:01:18] *** Parts: Oss[m] (~oss1983ma@2001:470:69fc:105::f8a9) ()
[17:01:39] <bfredl> so extending conceal with those restrictions to anything else like tree-sitter is not very heavy lifting. already vim8 does this with matchaddposs.
[17:01:39] <clason[m]> oh, that's right, people have been complaining about highlighting conceals ...
[17:01:43] <bfredl> s/with/_with/, s/restrictions/restrictions_/, s/matchaddposs/matchaddpos/
[17:02:31] <bfredl> I think, in addition to that, just changing the highlight group is not a big deal. the other stuff (like multiple cchar, proper text reflow, etc etc) is a bigger deal tho.
[17:02:43] <clason[m]> yup

[17:20:17] <luisiacc[m]> I can confirm, I I remove the last commit of gitsigns, this error doesn't happen
[17:20:18] <lewis6991[m]> i.e. did you relaunch nvim after updating?
[17:20:18] <ii14[m]> Anonymity: try `let g:indent_blankline_show_trailing_blankline_indent = v:false`
[17:21:04] <luisiacc[m]> > you're not doing any weird hot-reloading stuff are you?
[17:21:04] <luisiacc[m]> juust using `formatting_async()` from lsp, which is hanled by null-ls I think, perhaps they do some werid stuff
[17:21:12] <aerocn[m]> ii14[m]: Thanks a lot, I'll try it

[17:22:56] <aerocn[m]> ii14[m]: cool he is effective

[17:26:01] <luisiacc[m]> Oh nvm, I restarted neovim and now the error went away, I think is because I ran `PlugUpdate` and updated the plugin but didn't reload it
[17:26:14] <lewis6991[m]> that is exactly why!
[17:26:51] <lewis6991[m]> whenever updating plugins, always restart the editor

[17:32:19] <ahmed-rezk-devAh> How to enable syntax highlighting for a specific filetype?
[17:33:53] <ii14[m]> wdym
[17:34:11] <ii14[m]> syntax highlighting should be enabled for everything by default
[17:34:17] <ii14[m]> everything that vim supports that is

[17:37:45] <ii14[m]> vim already has html highlighting

[17:39:52] <buu> ahmed-rezk-devAh: set the filetype to html

[17:51:42] <Evergreen> I assume that *.tsx.snap is the file extension you're looking to highlight, if it is .test.tsx.snap then change it to au BufNewFile,BufRead *.test.tsx.snap filetype=html

[17:56:06] <Evergreen> right now I have to resort to installing all of those python packages inside of every virtual environment

[18:26:08] <Evergreen> okay, I did sort of work out a solution
[18:26:48] <Evergreen> when using the built-in venv module in python you can pass the --system-site-packages argument to give the venv access to globally installed python packages
[18:26:48] <theh> I'm trying to get lualine to show if treesitter syntax highlighting is active, but unsure how to determine that. I tried `require("nvim-treesitter.parsers").has_parser()` but that seems more general than highlight status.
[18:27:10] <Evergreen> it's not ideal and I don't know if that's even an option in pipenv/poetry but it works for now
