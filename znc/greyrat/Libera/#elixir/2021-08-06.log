[17:24:35] <mexen> what is the general advice regarding using a later version of elixir while reading a book using an older version?
[17:25:25] *** Quits: hendursa1 (~weechat@user/hendursaga) (Quit: hendursa1)
[17:25:32] <rawtaz> i'd say that you'll still get a lot out of it :)
[17:25:43] *** Joins: hendursaga (~weechat@user/hendursaga)
[17:28:04] <mexen> rawtaz how would you reconcile scenarios such as this... when you run `mix new project`...the version of elixir you are using has a different tree from what's in the book. For example maybe the config directory isn't there
[17:28:33] <mexen> Just go along with it, huh?
[17:28:56] <mexen> Or downgrade to match the version in the book?
[17:28:59] <rawtaz> if you want my honest opinion - i'd find it a bit of a shame that i dont have updated material, but on the bright side it encourages me to truly understand the tree and files in there better. as long as you make sure you understand the stuff, the tree being slightly different shouldnt be a problem.
[17:29:14] <rawtaz> and thats why youre reading it in the first place, to understand how it's put together, right
[17:29:21] <mexen> All right, thank you.
[17:29:23] <mexen> Yes, it is.
[17:29:29] <rawtaz> i would just keep applying brain cells to it lol. i wouldnt downgrade
[17:29:51] <mexen> Haha sure thing
[17:30:00] <Nicd> config is still a thing even if it's not in the typical boilerplate. if you build the phoenix boilerplate, it will include the config dir for example
[17:30:00] <rawtaz> as long as it's manageable. if theyre WAY too different, such that it's a real problem for me to get anything out of it, i would look for new material. i wouldnt go for a very old version
[17:30:11] <rawtaz> also you can complement the book with some online documentation
[17:30:24] <Nicd> personally I wouldn't go below Elixir 1.11 due to the config changes of runtime.exs
[17:30:24] <rawtaz> mexen: which versions are you talking about?
[17:30:39] <mexen> I have 1.9.1 running
[17:31:36] <rawtaz> and the book is for?
[17:31:41] <mexen> Book is running 1.6 I think

[17:33:30] <ericmj> elixir is backwards compatible to down 1.0 so you can always use a later when reading an older book. you may get a few warnings, but they should guide to how to fix them

[18:19:16] <Ankhers> I believe I have found a bug in Mix, but I have no real idea how to go about debugging it. My issue is that I am trying to run `mix deps.update --all` or `mix deps.get` on my project. Both of those commands cause mix to just sit there trying to resolve my hex dependencies. But it eats all 32GB of my RAM and 32GB of my swap. One of my colleagues tried running it on his 512GB RAM machine and it still ate all of that. I have narrow
[18:19:17] <Ankhers> down to certain dependencies that if I remove from the list, will no longer cause issues. But I don't really know how I can go about getting more information on something like this. I also haven't been able to recreate it on a small project. Would anyone have suggestions on what I can potentially do to debug this?
[18:21:14] <ericmj> it is a known issue that hex will take a long time and use a lot of memory to resolve some dependencies
[18:21:35] <ericmj> if you can give the mix.exs and mix.lock file ion the small project it would help
[18:22:18] <ericmj> please add it here https://github.com/hexpm/hex/issues/857
[18:22:46] <Ankhers> Unfortuantely I haven't been able to create a small project with this issue. Just the large project at my day job.
[18:23:42] <ericmj> What I do is I remove as many deps I can and see if still fails
[18:23:56] <ericmj> but the large project would also help if you cant minimize it
[18:25:22] <Ankhers> I'll see if I can cut it down any.

[20:10:47] <Ankhers> Is there some process in place for taking over an unmaintained hex package?
[20:11:04] <rawtaz> harass ericmj until he gives in
[20:11:22] <Ankhers> That doesn't sound enjoyable for either of us.
[20:11:50] <rawtaz> hah, thats very true now that i think about it. thanks for the heads up
[20:13:54] <Ankhers> ericmj: I will ask politely once though. I guess when I transferred the mongodb and mongodb_ecto packages to deadtrickster, little to no updates went into the packages. I guess scottmessinger has taken up the packages in an attempt to keep them moving. Unfortunately he is unable to push to hex because he doesn't have permissions. If there is anything that can be done with transferring ownership, it would help the mongo community
[20:14:17] <Ankhers> And this has taught me to keep myself on the list of owners for packages I had over to other people.
[20:25:15] <joshproehl> I have an app with elixirc_paths getting set to ["lib", "test/support"], but my json_helper.ex (AppName.JSONHelper) is not getting compiled to a .beam file in the testing env... And I'm really not sure how to go about debugging this further. :-D  Any suggestions?
