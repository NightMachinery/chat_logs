[00:10:56] <moshe> currently, something I'd really like to fix in vim proper, is the dozen or so *syntax* files that arbitrarily call for specific ansi or xterm colors, when they have absolutely no right to do so.

[04:06:33] <izabera> hi there, can someone help me?  i have my code in ~/work/reponame but i build in a docker container in which the code gets mapped to /src/reponame.  because of this, all the paths in compile_commands.json are relative to /src/reponame or to other code and libraries that i only have inside the container and not outside.
[04:06:52] <izabera> i got clangd (inside of docker) to talk to vim (outside), but now when i try to jump to a definition it looks for a local file that i either don't have at all or i don't have under that path.  what's the right way to do it?

[14:23:57] <puremourning> ouch
[14:24:34] <mgedmin> (python is special: lack of static types makes type inference and therefore context-specific completion hard/impossible)

[14:25:11] <lericson> i think you can write python s.t. it works okay with completion and such
[14:25:21] <lericson> type hints are indeed huge for that
