[20:00:17] <gwozniak> oh god, what do they think is wrong with it
[20:01:14] <gerikson> "bias"

[20:01:18] <buttsbot> Twitter - scottjshapiro - Snowdenâ€™s fears were well-founded. He predicted he would live in a totalitarian state that controls the internet.
[20:01:50] <gwozniak> Give me a fucking break
[20:03:14] <Brekkjern> I mean, it's posted on Twitter, so it's not a good start.
[20:09:44] <gwozniak> The thing that drives me nuts about "team freedom" is that they think unfettered freedom is a realistic endgoal for a social system.  It clearly isn't
[20:10:09] <gwozniak> Also, they consider someone *not* wanting to publish their view as censorship
[20:10:51] <gerikson> hey guys did you hear? Russia (the country) is being cancelled
[20:11:08] <gerikson> that's not really the own they think it is
[20:11:17] <gerikson> they can just use another global economy ;)
[20:11:22] <gwozniak> Indeed
[20:12:11] <gerikson> I guess conservatives can just get a tanker, sail over  there, and load up some crude
[20:12:15] <gerikson> pay in $$$
[20:20:52] <kronk> damn, restic does some good backup stuff.
[20:21:08] <kronk> it deduped nearly all of my partial disk dumps to roughly the size of the single disk.
[20:33:52] <gwozniak> I've got to decide on a backup service soon.  I don't know how much I actually want to store offsite
[20:35:26] <gwozniak> gerikson: my other favourite thing about those who complain about bias everywhere is that they don't seem to entertain the idea that what they are thinking is actually wrong

[20:52:24] <buttsbot> Twitter - beschlossdc - US Department of State asks Americans in Russia to leave immediately.
[20:52:28] <ngoldbaum> fuuuuuck
[20:52:32] <ngoldbaum> i fucking hate this
[20:57:24] <gwozniak> It's a ploy to get Snowden
[21:03:01] <Brekkjern> lol
[21:10:21] <kronk> ngoldbaum: suggest you stop doomscrolling.
[21:10:47] <kronk> unless you live _right next to russia_.
[21:10:58] <kronk> in which case doomscrolling is just called news.
[21:12:16] <ngoldbaum> there are so many ways this can spiral out of control and i hate that itâ€™s gotten so far

[23:04:56] <kronk> "there are so many ways this can spiral out of control" like what. how many of them will affect you.
[23:05:08] <river> lol
[23:05:16] <kronk> I don't think there's going to be a nuclear fuck it moment.
[23:05:18] <river> who cares it doesn't affect me
[23:05:25] <kronk> if so what the hell can you do about it.
[23:05:55] <kronk> oh no, you should care. and care a lot. but letting it form an ulcer from stress when you're not in any danger is counterproductive.
[23:06:12] <kronk> panic is the enemy.
[23:07:30] <kronk> if russia launches nukes, we can shoot them down. we aren't going to retaliate with nukes by fear of the dead hand, but that doesn't mean we can't let them exhaust their nuclear arsenal.
[23:07:56] <kronk> and the russians are aware of that.
[23:08:13] <kronk> MAD is an appropriate deterrent for TWO aggressing parties, not one.
[23:09:23] <kronk> so relax, kick back, and watch Putin throw a tantrum. mourn for Ukraine and celebrate their victories.
[23:10:46] <bkero> Hard to relax when you are friends with Ukranians.
[23:11:32] <kronk> yeah at that point it does impact you.
[23:12:03] <kronk> the only thing I can offer is logistics and money.
[23:12:17] <bkero> It'll impact you if they stop exporting neon
[23:12:27] <kronk> meh, I'm okay with that.
[23:12:36] <kronk> chip shortage go.
[23:12:43] <bkero> How lucky for you
[23:13:36] <kronk> I'm sure all of us could wait for a fucking chip for non critical usage like medical equipment.
[23:14:18] <kronk> that'll be impacted but there's already a good surplus of the stuff that goes into said equipment.
[23:14:36] <bkero> or that truck fleet that gets you your food
[23:14:40] <kronk> supply chain ripples will happen.
[23:15:11] <bkero> Fleet purchases have already been delayed 2 years
[23:16:16] <kronk> I'm surprised it isn't longer.
[23:16:24] <kronk> and yet the supply chain will adapt
[23:16:28] <bkero> You hope
[23:16:54] <kronk> no, surprised. don't try to make it that I'm worried.
[23:17:45] <bkero> I can't make you worried, but I can point out that what you're saying are naive assumptions
[23:20:08] <kronk> we'll see.
