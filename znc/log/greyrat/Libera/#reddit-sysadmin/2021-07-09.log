[05:43:24] <rumham> After all this printernightmare, if you found a policy enabling point and print for your whole enterprise (without elevation) what would happen if one was to disable it? Would everyone get disconnected from the printer they already added?
[05:44:40] <misspwn> it wouldn't happen immediately
[05:45:07] <xe0n> point and print, no
[05:45:18] <xe0n> should be fine if you've specified the the printer mappings etc
[05:45:53] <xe0n> there's multiple steps to do for this printer stuff
[05:46:01] <misspwn> was thinking of just a broad gpo refresh rates
[05:46:08] <xe0n> [2021.07.08.22:46:11] <xe0n> [2021.07.08.21:29:41] <xe0n> [2021.07.08.15:01:00] <xe0n> 1. disable spooler on dcs 2. disable spooler on non-member servers that dont require printing 3. disable workstation client print requests 4. configure point and print settings 5. deploy the patch
[05:46:27] <xe0n> disable spooler on member servers that dont require to print*
[05:46:31] <xe0n> i should fix that next time i copy pasta
[05:46:33] <xe0n> haha
[05:47:08] <rumham> I got all the mitigation stuff
[05:47:12] <rumham> but after that, and after patching
[05:47:17] <rumham> I find we have point and print enabled
[05:47:20] *** Joins: signofzeta (~signofzet@user/signofzeta)
[05:47:22] <rumham> via gpo
[05:47:27] <rumham> with elevation disabled
[05:47:35] <rumham> which if I understand right, leaves us still vulnerable
[05:47:53] <xe0n> sure so disable it
[05:47:56] <rumham> Im worried about checking this point and print thing off, but also worried about leaving it in place
[05:48:23] <rumham> If I disable it, all my users arent going to get a driver prompt right? It would just be for new printers they try to add
[05:48:36] <xe0n> Point and Print is a term that refers to the capability of allowing a user on a Windows 2000 and later client to create a connection to a remote printer without providing disks or other installation media. All necessary files and configuration information are automatically downloaded from the print server to the client.
[05:48:51] <xe0n> so disabling it means you're not allowing non-administrators to install drivers
[05:48:55] <xe0n> which...should be disabled anyway
[05:49:01] <rumham> right I agree
[05:49:15] <rumham> but it wouldnt break existing
[05:49:20] <xe0n> so as long as your clients have the drivers installed already, shouldn't break anything
[05:49:33] <rumham> what if they got the driver installed via point and print
[05:49:35] <xe0n> no not unless a user is trying to install their own print drivers, which instead of it being successful, it prompts for elevation
[05:49:40] <xe0n> its _already_ installed
[05:49:41] <xe0n> LOL
[05:49:48] <xe0n> you're preventing future installs
[05:49:49] <rumham> lol okay thank you
[05:49:57] <misspwn> i've really only seen it impacting USB connected printers rumham 
[05:50:06] <rumham> I just recall adjusting this at one point and everyone getting the driver/uac/prompt loop
[05:50:09] *** pntaylor_ is now known as pntaylor
[05:50:17] <rumham> got it
[05:50:26] <xe0n> then i'd review how you're deploying printer drivers and mappings lol
[05:50:42] <xe0n> you know you can do testing, right?
[05:50:55] <rumham> well 90% of cases, the printers are pushed out via gpo
[05:50:55] <xe0n> greate a gpo that handles this, link it to a small group of machines, test
[05:50:59] <xe0n> then once confirmed, deploy
[05:51:00] <rumham> 10% we manually add 
[05:51:01] <xe0n> UAT people...
[05:51:03] <rumham> via browsing
[05:51:13] <rumham> right Ive tested with my skunkworks OU
[05:51:19] <rumham> but Im worried Im not getting a good test
[05:51:23] <misspwn> and a neat feature microsoft rolled out was so that even though you removed the drivers and uninstalled the device, it doesn't always delete the bad drivers. because of this, been getting a lot of webcam/audio errors and printers malfunctioning
[05:51:43] <rumham> since this point and print policy is set via the default policy so I am wondering if I am not getting a good test due to precedence of policies applying
[05:51:48] <xe0n> oh jeez
[05:51:52] <xe0n> dont do it in the default domain policy
[05:51:59] <rumham> oh yeah horrific
[05:52:09] <xe0n> create a policy specifically for it, apply to a small subset of machines, test
[05:52:16] <xe0n> once satisifed tests have been completed, roll out to rest of fleet
[05:52:23] <xe0n> do _not_ attach it at the root of the domain
[05:52:26] <rumham> I know this is something I inherited
[05:52:27] <misspwn> people just need to stop printing, disable it all thx
[05:53:18] <rumham> with point and print disabled they always need an admin to install a printer
[05:53:37] <xe0n> correct, or you map through gpo which can deploy a driver
[05:53:51] <rumham> with it enabled but requiring elevation would mean they could be a local admin and add it or still require an admin
[05:54:00] <misspwn> that's when you send carl, gpo could work too. it's much cleaner that way tbh
[05:54:06] <rumham> when you mean via gpo
[05:54:17] <misspwn> create printer policy to deploy printers with set drivers. 
[05:54:20] <rumham> just the basic adding a printer via gpo preferences
[05:54:24] <xe0n> if they're a local admin of the machine, then they can elevate and install the driver yes
[05:54:31] <xe0n> yes
[05:54:48] <rumham> I dont recall a spot in there to specify a driver though, it just pulls what the print server is offering?
[05:55:07] <xe0n> correct
[05:55:19] <rumham> okay wow thanks for the sanity check/dumb questions
[05:55:20] <xe0n> specify the queue on the print server, as long as print server is configured correctly driver will be deployed
[05:55:26] <rumham> got it
[05:56:42] <misspwn> its ezpz to add them in print manager so if you messed something up and gpo hasn't refreshed locally on their workstations then you can be like hey carroll if you have an issue log off/on or run it manually
[05:57:06] <sd> 14<i‚Äãtsgboccia> Always helps to have a second set of eyes on something.
[05:58:36] <rumham> misspwn: gotcha, I feel like I go between adding via print mgmt and adding the long way via gpo editor
[05:59:18] <misspwn> is it not normal to combine the two?
[05:59:54] <xe0n> print management is the console on the print server where you configure the queues, use gpo to map the queues to workstations lol
[06:00:05] <misspwn> ^
[06:00:33] <misspwn> it's not always set up that way which is why people have so many extra annoying print problems
[06:00:44] <xe0n> correct
[06:01:00] <xe0n> many moving pieces for a successful printer deployment :P
[06:01:40] <misspwn> when it is set up that way, you always know what is where and who. you can even step it up further so that certain printers won't even show up if you \\servername
[06:02:21] <misspwn> HR or Exec printer hidden unless you are said person
[06:02:42] <xe0n> no need to hide, just apply permissions lol

[06:03:16] <xe0n> printers suck sure, but you can make them work fine lol
[06:03:21] <misspwn> which is why if you set it up poorly it just adds on to how they are already terrible

[09:09:09] <signofzeta> Anything USB-C is a plus.  It's one wire.  Bonus points if it can charge the laptop.
[09:11:30] <Sousapro> c|oneman: if it's usb-c, pretty much any of those usb-c hubs with the built in hdmi, couple of usb ports and usb-c PD passthrough 
[09:11:39] <Sousapro> Ethernet versions exist too
[09:11:44] <xe0n> so pretty much any monitor
[09:11:47] <Sousapro> Shouldn't be very expensive at all

[12:05:34] <xe0n> ok so
[12:05:47] <xe0n> the past few features builds, i'm going to say 2004, there's been the enablement packages
[12:06:13] <xe0n> so they're super handy if you're -1 build from the latest, you can just download them and it flips the bits, and you're good to go
[12:06:30] <xe0n> for downleveled, especially around the 1909, probably best to approve the entire feature update offering in wsus

[12:17:04] <sd> 13<Z‚Äãodiam> they are a PITA enough on their own without updates breaking them
[12:19:57] <xe0n> then dont deploy the update and keep the mitigations in place?
[12:20:15] <xe0n> this is part of patch management, understanding and accepting risk
[12:20:25] <ThatOneRoadie> Honestly that's what we're doing at this point
[12:20:41] <xe0n> you know they're going to release another oob in a few days if this is busting zebra printers
[12:20:44] <xe0n> they're in every fucking warehouse!
[12:20:48] <ThatOneRoadie> GPO to disable spooler on everything, secondary GPO to enable it case-by-case, and wait for the oob fix
[12:21:02] <ThatOneRoadie> And treat computers with the secondary GPO as hostile.
[12:21:04] <xe0n> [2021.07.09.13:36:24] <xe0n> [2021.07.09.11:16:09] <xe0n> [2021.07.08.22:46:11] <xe0n> [2021.07.08.21:29:41] <xe0n> [2021.07.08.15:01:00] <xe0n> 1. disable spooler on dcs 2. disable spooler on member servers that dont require printing 3. disable workstation client print requests 4. configure point and print settings 5. deploy the patch
[12:21:15] <xe0n> yep
[12:21:17] <ThatOneRoadie> Print servers only, they don't get domain admin accounts logging into them ever.
[12:21:29] <xe0n> yep you manage the risk, but also this has been a wake up call for some
[12:21:39] <ThatOneRoadie> We've been hostile-network for a while now
[12:21:54] <ThatOneRoadie> lots of sniffers and honey pots on our network, and they've been working well
[12:22:03] <xe0n> i had a spring in my step the day things were announced because guess what? ive _always_ recommended, and done when i've been building out an AD, disabled the print spooler on DCs
[12:22:18] <xe0n> or have less run approach on dcs
[12:22:21] <xe0n> and boy that paid off
[12:22:26] <ThatOneRoadie> lots of active threat protection too. Automated port shutdowns for vulnerable servers, crypto reaching out over the network, etc
[12:22:38] <ThatOneRoadie> and yeah, there's like two accounts that can log into the DC on the entire network
[12:22:41] <xe0n> so, sure i had things to do still for print nightmare, but at least i knew the main threat from the dc sides of things wasn't applying to our environment
[12:22:48] <ThatOneRoadie> mind you, this is one of the largest AD Forests microsoft knows about
[12:23:06] <xe0n> yep
[12:23:20] <ThatOneRoadie> I think we're in the neighborhood of 218,000 devices on this AD forest last I checked
[12:23:26] <xe0n> so anyway, auto deployment of patches, no thanks.

[23:13:58] <Jaelae> my last job was unlimited pto
[23:14:03] <Jaelae> but like we had no support on our team
[23:14:09] <Jaelae> so if you were out you had a lot of work to come back to

[23:14:14] <Jaelae> my new job i get about 35 days off per year
[23:14:18] <Sousapro> After they said that they would not pay out lost PTO 
[23:14:20] <sintax> jesus
[23:14:32] <sintax> i get 2 weeks. aka 10 days my first year. 
[23:14:49] <sintax> are you all in a big corporate environment? 
[23:14:55] <signofzeta> Yeah, during my time off, clients would still call my phone, I was expected to respond to emails, and do everything except actual work.  Then when I got back, it'd all be there for me.
[23:14:57] <Jaelae> i am yea
[23:15:00] <Jaelae> we have 300,000 employees

[23:15:54] <sintax> my company is about 225 employees

[23:20:35] <sintax> the employee's banging eachother and then being mad at each other for it.

[23:21:19] <Sousapro> Oh jeez
[23:21:37] <Sousapro> I worked in a warehouse after high school but it was drug free 
[23:21:54] <Sousapro> Or at least there was actual random drug testing when you punched in
[23:22:02] <sintax> yeah....we were drug free too
[23:22:14] <sintax> we didn't do randoms. a lot of my employees were temps. 
[23:22:17] <Sousapro> Like you'd swipe through security and you had 24 hours to get to the lab 
[23:22:23] <sintax> dang 
[23:22:25] <Sousapro> They'd give you a paper 
[23:22:31] <sintax> left that all for IT. I couldn't do it anymore.
