[03:42:43] <muradm> is there a better way to achive this https://paste.rs/RKL

[03:46:35] <krux02> is there a function to convert a list of strings into a regular expression that matches any of those words, but as whole words not just parts of a word

[03:49:24] <muradm> krux02: yes am of aware of escaping regexps in other languages, but elisp regexp escaping is not yet clear for me

[03:49:54] <krux02> well, there is rx-builder that might help you
[03:49:59] <krux02> or (rx ...)
[03:50:11] <muradm> but in the same examples i see [ ] which matches white space
[03:50:12] <krux02> rx is most readable but verbose, and rx builder is instant feedback
[03:50:18] <muradm> why not \\[ \\]
[03:50:56] <krux02> because [ ] is any charactor between [ and ], and that character is whitespace
[03:51:12] <muradm> for the same link example above, should i \[ to match actual [ or \\[

[04:32:57] <s1rr> hello
[04:33:34] <alphapapa[m]> yooo lennyy you're back
[04:33:41] <lennyy> yessir B)
[04:33:56] <alphapapa[m]> and with the shaaades
[04:35:00] <lennyy> is it safe to open irc on 2 different laptops
[04:35:11] <lennyy> or do u gotta close 1 and then open the other
[04:35:28] <lennyy> (coulda just found out but im lazy)
[04:35:56] <bremner> what kind of "safety" issues are you worried about?
[04:36:36] <lennyy> like u know how u cant have 2 ppl using the same nickname
[04:37:33] <alphapapa[m]> well, that's one of the things Matrix solves: you can view your Matrix account and rooms from any number of devices simultaneously

[04:40:28] <alphapapa[m]> Matrix is kind of like IMAP: the server receives messages for you, and you can log in and view them anytime, from anything
[04:40:30] <bremner> I guess the short answer is if you want to use the same nick from multiple connections, you will need some kind of proxy or bouncer. matrix is one option
[04:40:40] <bremner> there are many others.
[04:40:45] <lennyy> oh yeaaaa
[04:41:00] <lennyy> i could probably make my own kinda service for that

[09:42:20] <bsturmfels> is there some variant of nxml-mode that would validate HTML but also handle Django templates? Maybe that's not possible because you'd technically need to evaluate the templates to do it properly
[09:43:11] <twb> bsturmfels: this is why you want METAL instead of jinja2
[09:44:13] <twb> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_Attribute_Language
[09:44:59] <twb> It's an EDSL instead of non-E DSL, so the validator just goes "oh another schema, no worries"
[09:46:21] <twb> Same as having SVG in HTML

[09:47:41] <bsturmfels> twb: interesting, thanks. There doesn't seem to be much cross-polination between the Zope/Django communities. I know very little about Zope/Plone, but I figure there must be lots of re-inventing the wheel going on
[09:47:59] <bsturmfels> (re-inventing on the Django side at least)
[09:48:13] <twb> bsturmfels: sadly, TAL isn't an option anymore
[09:48:37] <bsturmfels> twb: what do they use these days?
[09:48:58] <twb> Apart from anything else, the WHATWG terror squad switched HTML to its own in-house parser that's only used for HTML
[09:49:19] <twb> So it's not possible to validate HTML using a schema, or to mix HTML with any other language

I am experiencing a very strange rendering issue when editing certain sections, that can only really be seen rather than described.

[10:12:42] <parsnip> mfiano: are you trying to test the .org file without doom?
[10:12:51] <parsnip> oh, doom users
[10:13:40] <mfiano> I cannot reproduce with -Q, but that doesn't render markup that separates the model from the view anyway.
[10:14:32] <mfiano> I am a long time Emacs user. Only started using Doom last year to give myself more time than constantly tweaking my decade old config when a package breaks something.
[10:14:50] <parsnip> does doom have some version of -Q, like `HOME=/tmp/testing doom`?
[10:15:25] <mfiano> I don't think so.
[10:15:48] <mfiano> I guess I could binary search through all the packages to see if it is package related or internal to Doom.

[10:21:04] <parsnip> but that's sort of what i meant by HOME=/tmp/testing
[10:21:07] <mfiano> My Doom config is under version control, but I only configure common-lisp mode. Everything else is stock
[10:21:28] <parsnip> so stock doom will do that to your org file?
[10:22:05] <mfiano> Yes, but I don't know if it's some code in Doom or one of the many org-altering packages it brings in...or just my document malformed.
[10:22:25] <parsnip> can you "bisect" your org document?
[10:22:41] <mfiano> That hasn't proved very effective.
[10:23:11] <parsnip> hmm, but the issue exists for full org document, but not for empty document, no?
[10:23:27] <mfiano> Right. I guess I could try showing the issue.
[10:23:37] <parsnip> does it occur in terminal doom?
[10:23:58] <parsnip> does it occur if you remove the second half of the file?
[10:24:12] <parsnip> why would bisecting the org document not work?
[10:24:26] <mfiano> Well I'll explain with 2 images.
[10:24:51] <mfiano> Here is a view of my document, with the cursor after one of the list items in the Table of Contents section: https://i.lisp.cl/diyCrC.png
[10:25:57] <mfiano> Upon pressing return, or "o" to open a new line, it splices in the middle of the next Rationale section: https://i.lisp.cl/fMe35S.png
[10:26:04] <mfiano> and the Rationale section is then missing

[10:32:37] <parsnip> not to give you a hard time, but you like doom because you don't have to config, but doom support is a bit different
[10:32:50] <mfiano> It goes away if the last paragraph is removed only
[10:33:10] <parsnip> and stays if you remove the other paragraphs?
[10:33:41] <mfiano> I understand. I have been meaning to set some time aside to update my vanilla config to get around black box magic like this, but...time is the problem.
[10:33:55] <mfiano> Yes
[10:34:10] <parsnip> maybe split that paragraph on punctuation?
[10:34:20] <parsnip> i mean, add newlines after punctuation?
[10:34:36] <mfiano> It doesn't occur with ONLY the last paragraph though

[10:37:34] <parsnip> still?

[11:26:57] <pjb> no. It's not linked to the emacsclient, but to the window or the frame.
[11:27:26] <mattf> This is isad
[11:27:43] <mattf> im doing ssh -X emacsclient ....
[11:28:04] <mattf> but this one has a lower resolution and things are too big

[11:29:23] <kilobug> mattf: you could try xpra instead of ssh -X it's more bandwidth-efficient and has much more options; but perhaps using tramp would be a better solution (although I'm not sure exactly how to link it with emacsclient)

[19:19:35] <Mentat> Alright, so I have a weird problem. On Windows, C-) is legitimately not registered as a keypress. C-0, as is C-x ) and every other thing I've tried. C-( is detected just fine. I can't find any other keypresses that are not detected. Does anyone have any ideas on what's going on? My config is identical under Linux, and it works fine. The major difference is on Linux, I run master and on Windows I run 27.2.
[19:20:25] <Mentat> I can't even C-h k C-). It just doesn't register that anything's happened.
[19:20:38] <rpav> probably something is capturing it then
[19:20:59] <rpav> you'll find similar in linux if some program is intercepting some key, it will just not press
[19:21:13] <Mentat> I can't imagine what it would be.
