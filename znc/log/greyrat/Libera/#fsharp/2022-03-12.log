[00:01:02] <jinsun__> okay so that's what the ToString for that object decided to give
[00:01:50] <jinsun__> you can always construct a string differently than .ToString() if you didn't like what it gives, and then use %s
[00:02:50] <sonny> content has this method ` CopyToAsync(Stream) ` but I dunno how streams work
[00:03:09] <sonny> I don't think `printfn` can help me ...
[00:08:40] <jinsun__> sonny: maybe you wanted this https://bpa.st/MZVQ
[00:08:43] <biberu> sonny: about getting the value >out< of the Async<>, you might want to stay inside and e.g. map over it instead
[00:09:36] <sonny> jinsun_ thanks, I didn't want to read as a string, but this is good for an example
[00:10:02] <sonny> is () required when the method is void?
[00:12:23] <jinsun__> okay, then I didn't get what you wanted, printing would require making a string at some step, you can do it in chunks using some other methods maybe, but can't directly print some object
[00:12:51] <sonny> I was thinking CopyToAsync(stdout)
[00:13:12] <sonny> I'm still working on it
[00:14:23] <jinsun__> and there is no void function, all functions take something, if in C# it took nothing then in F# it takes one parameter of the unit type
[00:14:35] <jinsun__> and () is the only instance of unit
[00:15:04] <sonny> I see, thanks
