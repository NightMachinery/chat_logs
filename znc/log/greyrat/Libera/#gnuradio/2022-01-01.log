[03:30:27] <drmpeg> funkylab[m] The multiply const blocks have a fairly long history. You were correct that the original fast version was to take advantage of Volk. Then noc0lour templated the old multiply const block and added that YAML trick where it uses the fast block when vector = 1. Then vector I/O was added to the fast multiply const block.
[03:30:57] <funkylab[m]> aaah
[03:30:58] <funkylab[m]> thanks yeah
[03:31:05] <funkylab[m]> so we need to keep both, and maybe come up with a better name
[03:33:02] <drmpeg> For an I/O vector > 1 (and you can still use a scalar const), the fast multiply const is faster.
[03:33:26] <drmpeg> But yeah, the scalar const is not obvious.

[05:19:45] <funkylab[m]> source: completed a build, not 10 minutes ago
[05:20:02] <funkylab[m]> do you have a manually installed forward-ported cmake, somehow?
[05:22:57] <yootis[m]> nope, I've got cmake-3.20.5-1.fc34
[05:23:49] <funkylab[m]> ah sorry, I misread
[05:23:52] <funkylab[m]> "cmake 3.10" 
[05:24:23] <funkylab[m]> so, I hope this is good news, but 3.10 definitely builds on my f34 machine

[05:25:32] <funkylab[m]> ah by the way, happy new year folks!
[05:25:57] <funkylab[m]> I'm currently YEARS ahead of the US and Canada
[05:27:30] <yootis[m]> I don't think it would be a cmake issue.  Did something change between 3.9 and 3.10 wrt pthreads?

[05:28:41] <funkylab[m]> nothing I'm aware of, and agreed, doesn't look like cmake
[05:29:22] <yootis[m]> I'm using current maint-3.10 BTW
[05:30:00] <funkylab[m]> I'll have to leave, but at this point my best guess would be "start with a clean build directory", and make sure your linker doesn't somehow end up being the one you use for PDP-11 cross-building
[05:30:51] <yootis[m]> We're good there, my only cross-building is for RISC-V, but I'll keep looking.
[05:31:03] <funkylab[m]> matter of fact, most of my builds are done with the cmake flag `-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS=-fuse-ld=lld  -DCMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS=-fuse-ld=lld` and admittedly `-DENABLE_CTRLPORT_THRIFT=Off`
[05:31:29] <funkylab[m]> * `-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS=-fuse-ld=lld  -DCMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS=-fuse-ld=lld`
[05:31:34] <yootis[m]> I'll try clang and see if it comes out differently
[05:32:14] <funkylab[m]> yeah, but even clang builds use the default `gold` `ld`, lest you use said strange `-fuse-ld` flags
