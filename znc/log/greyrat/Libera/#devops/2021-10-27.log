[00:45:21] <slaughter> Anyone have any recommendations on resources for mastering CI/CD? Not worried as much about "how to use $SYSTEM", more along the lines of best practices, culture swaying, etc. I'm trying to become the defacto owner/evangelizer of CI/CD in our org. 
[00:45:35] <slaughter> Plenty of experience messing with CI/CD systems, just not sure I have the big picture totally down
[00:49:50] <rawtaz> probably depends a lot on the organization
[00:49:54] <rawtaz> i dunno
[00:50:55] <slaughter> Yeah I know it's a pretty vague ask with a lot of potential answers
[00:51:36] <slaughter> Just having a hard time finding anything beyond "for beginners" and "how to use Github Actions" stuff. I guess I'm probably better off diving in on some devops books

[01:04:38] <rawtaz> what is the actual problem youre trying to solve or so?
[01:04:44] <rawtaz> i mean, if you know this stuff, you know it? what are you missing?
[01:11:33] <slaughter> IDK exactly, if I'm being honest
[01:11:40] <slaughter> I feel like there's some big picture stuff I must be missing
[01:13:38] <slaughter> One part I think is a solid "need" for me is the cultural/shared work aspects of owning CI/CD in our org. I'm not writing the code, I only know the outer skirts of how most things work within the apps (because there are multiple apps and it's a lot to keep up with). I'm deploying things across multiple languages, multiple RDBMs, working with multiple teams.
[01:14:46] <slaughter> IE what are some things I could/should be doing to ensure that as an "owner" of our processes I am fulfilling my duties to the best of my ability and not making foot guns or enemies etc
[01:15:02] <rawtaz> if it's any comfort, a year or so ago i contacted a devops professional, i mean someone who has a company with a couple of employees and the only thing they do is help companies get on track with CI/CD and devops.
[01:15:26] <rawtaz> now, i wanted to ask a few guidance questions, like "im thinking this setup and these products and tools would be good, do you agree or recommend something else?"
[01:15:48] <rawtaz> i asked that, and it turns out that i, who dont formally work with devops in that sense at all, nor ci/cd, pretty much knew more about these things than he did.
[01:16:13] <slaughter> Heh that does kinda give some comfort
[01:16:23] <rawtaz> he might have more experience with the tools, but the general big picture, i dare say i understood better than he did. and thats not from experience as much as it is from having read, researched and foremost using common sense and KISS
[01:16:53] <rawtaz> yeah. so what im trying to say is that you might be underestimating your own knowledge in the field, and/or overestimating what others know more than you do. they might not :D
[01:16:59] <rawtaz> surely someone does, but probably fewer than you think
[01:17:04] <slaughter> This is my first devops position, and by far the most tech-oriented org I've worked for. I'm trying to work my way up the IC ladder and owning CI/CD is one of the big steps in my goal list. I want to kick its ass
[01:17:23] <rawtaz> that really cool, i love the energy you have in those ambitions :D
[01:17:34] <slaughter> Anything to keep off the management track!@
[01:18:17] <rawtaz> its great that you do consider "what am i missing - what other bigger picture stuff can i understand", that tells me youre not just running fast forward with tunnel vision
[01:18:20] <slaughter> But really I love this stuff. I really love knowing that me spending a couple hours on a pipeline might mean saving the devs from 10s of collective hours a week. Force multiplication
[01:18:33] <rawtaz> yeah that sounds nice :)
[01:18:49] <rawtaz> i wish i had the use case to work on that stuff. but im just a pesky consultant that never get to touch stuff that much
[01:18:50] <slaughter> My one mentor I've ever had drilled slowing down and thinking into my head
[01:19:12] <rawtaz> very good
[01:19:24] <rawtaz> measure twice cut once, and reflect on what the heck youre doing :>
[01:19:32] <slaughter> Sounds like you might get a lot of opportunity to touch a lot of things though, which is nice in it's own way
[01:20:07] <rawtaz> not really. i mostly work with small companies, so those bigger infras where devops and ci/cd is needed, i think you only get to meet those either when you are consulting and already know those things so people hire you to do it, OR when you get employed
[01:20:28] <rawtaz> its not like someone hire you to work on things like that if you havent already showed them that youve worked on that type of stuff at scale
[01:20:36] <slaughter> Move fast and break things also applies, up til it doesn't. That's really been the crux in this org for me - we have some things that are 100% in the move fast category, and more things in the DO NOT MOVE FAST category :p
[01:20:53] <rawtaz> yeah actually there's something to that as well. as long as it's in a controlled environment :)
[01:21:04] <rawtaz> heh nice. sounds interesting, that mix
[01:21:18] <rawtaz> may i ask what stacks you use, what software and tools are the main ones?
[01:21:22] <slaughter> <rawtaz> its not like someone hire you to work on things like that if you havent already showed them that youve worked on that type of stuff at scale - not necessarily, I got this job out of a webdev position that I got out of an engineering postion at a small marketing firm
[01:21:45] <rawtaz> yeah, but that's a *job*, right? youre employed. i mean as a consultant you wouldnt be hired
[01:21:49] <rawtaz> i only do consulting
[01:21:57] <slaughter> Ahhh ok yeah that makes sense
[01:22:14] <rawtaz> i agree that if you can get employed then you can definitely go into this, shouldnt take too long to be quite experienced :)
[01:22:41] <rawtaz> companies love to hire people that have brains and show they can manage the tech properly and solve problems the right way, and let them learn on the job
[01:22:54] <rawtaz> but when it comes to consultants they want those who can show they already did all that stuff
[01:23:41] <slaughter> We use Docker everywhere via ECS. Everything is AWS. One stack is Ruby/Rails with some node services here or there, another is React/TS. There's an API backbone kinda threaded through things but not a first class citizen (Lambda, APIG). Databases are multiple and varied from mongo to Postgres/MySQL on RDS to DynamoDB. All feeds into Redshift for our BI powered by redash.

[01:24:16] <rawtaz> hah. loots of stuff :D
[01:24:32] <slaughter> We use a lot of AWS CLI tools such as copilot-cli and CDK, as well as the Serverless framework and some occasional naked cloudformation. Devops (us) is moving towards Terraform but there was quite the established base coming in so it's a bit slow going
[01:24:33] <rawtaz> whats your CI/CD tooling though?
[01:24:53] <slaughter> Github Actions for the most part, Bitrise.io for our mobile app (React Native)
[01:25:09] <slaughter> Gotta say I hate Bitrise, but it does seem to work well enough to do the job
[01:25:24] <rawtaz> cool. you do that stuff a few years, then you start your own company and start freelancing as a consultant and make more £££
[01:25:25] <slaughter> We were using Bitbucket Pipelines but I've just finished migrating all that to GHA
[01:25:28] <rawtaz> err $$$
[01:25:30] <Dus10> I want to get into GitHub Actions
[01:25:55] <slaughter> Dus10 A) great name B) do it, it's really actually pretty easy after you get the first few bits down
[01:26:24] <Dus10> I have been doing Azure Pipelines for a while
[01:26:27] <slaughter> And there's already a solution for 90% of the things you're trying to do, or 100% if you're not doing anything too crazy
[01:28:27] <rawtaz> Dus10: werent you looking for engineers? maybe you can hire slaughter
[01:28:38] <rawtaz> he clearly needs a new place to boss around :)
[01:28:43] <rawtaz> he/she
[01:28:46] <slaughter> I will fight to keep my job with large heavy objects
[01:28:47] <slaughter> I love it
[01:28:48] <Dus10> yeah
[01:28:50] <rawtaz> haha ok
[01:28:54] <slaughter> :)
[01:28:58] <Dus10> need someone to help mentor my minions :)
[01:29:27] <Dus10> well, time to teach... first class after mid-term
[01:30:00] <rawtaz> maybe i should get myself employed instead. its just that i have such a flexible work style now. i can do stuff whenever i want and also i do 99% of it all remotely, so i can visit my dad for a few weeks if i want to, still working from there. not really seeing that type of setup when youre employed
[01:30:14] <rawtaz> Dus10: teach, you teach at some school?
[01:30:40] <slaughter> My org is 100% remote. Seems most startups are at this point. Dunno we qualify as a startup at this point (8 years in) but we don't qualify as much else so it's the term that gets used
[01:31:10] <slaughter> The pandemic has really changed things as far as remote work, thankfully. I love it
[01:31:27] <rawtaz> yeah
[01:31:43] <rawtaz> im a bit weary that it's going back to how it was to SOME extent - i know lots of companies want folks on site
[01:32:12] <rawtaz> but i guess it will regardless have shown them that work can continue even remotely, so its easier to be remote nowadays and the future anyway
[01:34:23] <slaughter> Yeah I've heard some people are getting drug back, but mostly in larger orgs
[01:34:43] <rawtaz> mm
[01:34:45] <slaughter> Lots of new startups during the pandemic though
[01:35:00] <slaughter> And you know they're all remote :)
[01:36:09] <rawtaz> yeah:)
[01:44:14] <Dus10> rawtaz: yes, I teach part-time at a community college
