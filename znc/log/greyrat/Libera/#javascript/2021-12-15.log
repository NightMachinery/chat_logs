[01:28:47] <ljharb> hoppity: you don't access anything in html
[01:28:58] <ljharb> hoppity: your JS imports it as a binding, and then it's available as that binding
[01:29:02] <PenguinMan98> Force the <video to always use the external speaker
[01:29:06] <ljharb> hoppity: note that you need to be using modules, and a bundler, for modern web dev
[01:29:36] <ljharb> PenguinMan98: if you don't have a native app, and the browsers you care about don't provide that api, then your sales team is caught lying and needs to stop doing that
[01:29:42] <hoppity> ljharb: yes, how do I use the binding inside <script> tags?
[01:30:22] <PenguinMan98> No, they are saying our COMPETITORS can guarantee this.
[01:30:26] <PenguinMan98> We can't
[01:30:28] <ljharb> hoppity: you don't have script tags. you use a bundlers.
[01:30:43] <ljharb> PenguinMan98: ok then your sales team is probably using a native app
[01:30:45] <PenguinMan98> We're using browsers, and whatever they are using they say it is a 'no download required' tech.
[01:30:47] <ljharb> PenguinMan98: sooo you'd have to build one
[01:31:05] <ljharb> PenguinMan98: iow, if "no download required" matters, then your competitors will always have features you don't, and that's the tradeoff
[01:31:08] *** Joins: darkdrgn2k (~darkdrgn2@user/darkdrgn2k)
[01:31:32] <PenguinMan98> So that's the current question is what could our competitors possibly be using besides browsers that don't require a download
[01:31:51] <darkdrgn2k> when i have a object called ITEM1 with a "Map(7)" with an entry like "test1.beta" -> object....  how do i access test1.beta ?
[01:31:51] <hoppity> ljharb: Maybe I am not understanding but: Yes, I am using a bundler (called Esbuild). My question is how do I use the modules that I've imported inside of <script> tags in my .html files?
[01:32:13] <darkdrgn2k> i tried ITEM1['test1.beta']  but didnt seem to work :/
[01:32:15] <ljharb> hoppity: ok, so then all your code is authored as modules
[01:32:23] <ljharb> hoppity: so "inside script tags" isn't a thing you should be thinking
[01:32:43] <ljharb> hoppity: a module that wants to use `tabulator` needs to `import Something from 'tabulator'`, and then it can reference `Something` in that module/file
[01:32:51] <ljharb> hoppity: iow, 100% of your code needs to be modules
[01:32:58] <ljharb> PenguinMan98: in iOS? nothing
[01:33:04] <ljharb> PenguinMan98: iow, your sales team is wrong about one of those things
[01:33:14] <PenguinMan98> OK

[01:34:00] <ljharb> hoppity: no, normal script tags in browsers offer no module features whatsoever, so it's impossible
[01:34:09] <ljharb> hoppity: every single bit of your browser JS needs to go through your bundler
[01:34:21] <ljharb> hoppity: you can use script type="module" but at that point, just use the bundler
[01:34:40] <hoppity> ljharb: the weird part is that I am able to use Jquery inside <script> tags even when I have imported Jquery as a module. So not sure how that is possible in that case.
[01:34:58] <ljharb> that's because jquery is an obsolete library that uses globals
[01:35:04] <hoppity> I see
[01:35:09] <ljharb> and it probably installs itself on the global when imported, which nothing should be doing
[01:36:44] <PenguinMan98> Do what we did: build your library as an extension of jQuery. Problem solved.
[01:36:51] <hoppity> ljharb: so if I want to let's say use a module to stylyze a table in my html file. Do I have to write a function in my bundled app.js that 1: Selects my table presumibly via ID and 2: Applies the style?

[02:12:56] <jellobot> banana_, Inline event handlers are essentially `eval` inside HTML markup - they're bad practice and result in poorly factored, hard-to-manage code. Seriously consider attaching your events with JavaScript, instead, eg: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.addEventListener
[02:12:59] <ljharb> oh oops

[02:21:16] <banana_> I think you can click any html element including form elements
[02:21:48] <ljharb> PenguinMan98: all of modern JS is a package now, so i'd suggest dropping everything to fix that (which is also many years overdue)
[02:21:49] <banana_> I think the issue is whether clicking a form element triggers the submit event type?
[02:21:52] <Alexendoo> Kingsy: .submit(), clicking a form would just be like clicking the area around the buttons/inputs, wouldn't do anything

[02:25:14] <ljharb> Kingsy: because if the *button* sends an ajax request, but hitting enter in a field refreshes the page, then your entire form is broken. you should be using a submit event listener on the form in that case.

[05:37:00] <FlorianBad> I'm coding a "push" notification system. The back-end will take 29s to return `204 No Content` (unless there's something), and I'm making XMLHttpRequest timeout after 31 seconds. My XMLHttpRequest also handles any response, including 204, so it can make a new request for another 30 seconds.
[05:37:02] <FlorianBad> Problem is, if I set xhr.timeout above 29s it never times out (in onTimeout = function()) which indicates that it probably received the 204. But the readyState never went above 0, it just doesn't seem to receive anything. How is that possible? Is 204 not a response? Is 31s timeout too long?
[05:40:06] <FlorianBad> And my code:  https://pastebin.com/tuVk3UUR

[05:45:52] <Slade> FlorianBad, neither of those things are true. try a simple test, someting that immediately returns a 204. see the results
[05:46:46] <Slade> i've used websockets, but never used eventsource, seems super interesting tho :)
[05:48:02] <FlorianBad> Slade: 204 immediate response simply produces the same result, it still never gets beyond state=0
[05:48:20] <FlorianBad> but now that makes me want to check with curl to make 100% sure I'm actually returning 204 successfully...
[05:51:03] <FlorianBad> Yeah I'm sane, my 204 response works

[21:32:45] <teut> that is great, but how does a simple call to the github api to fetch data such as stars, forks etc , that fetches lot of unnecessary things

[21:37:00] <PenguinMan98> Gun is agnostic to where it's being used
[21:37:22] <PenguinMan98> You can use it to push-state changes on both the client and server app
[21:37:46] <PenguinMan98> Or even broadcast the change to all user browsers
[21:38:12] <PenguinMan98> It's pretty slick
[21:39:30] <teut> I havent used a tool like this, let me check that, I couldnt not understand what it does yet, but your push state looks like it sets observers on various parts of api
[21:40:18] <PenguinMan98> If it still works how I remember, you initialize it and optionally pass a url to a relay server. new Gun('<server>')

[21:56:47] <PenguinMan98> Over time, all react apps eventually move all data towards root
[21:57:53] <teut> yes, that problem is still there with useState of updating a single node of that big tree
[21:58:03] <teut> that becomes complicated
[21:58:25] <PenguinMan98> Yep. And it wrecks composability
[21:58:40] <PenguinMan98> If you move a component into a tree that doesn't have the data you need, it breaks.
[21:58:56] <teut> yes
[21:59:17] <PenguinMan98> With gun as a store, you get perfect composability as each component can subscribe to the data it needs.
[21:59:28] <teut> ya , I ll try it

[23:40:29] <BinarySavior> hi, can someone help me with this? https://jsfiddle.net/41ftpwdy/2/
[23:41:45] <BinarySavior> when closing side-nav the y-position in document scroll changes because the div changes size and text wrapping makes it taller/shorter
[23:42:11] <BinarySavior> desired effect would be to retain the document location after closing the side nav
[23:44:24] <BinarySavior> i.e. still want to see *Header 2* at the top after closing the side-nav

[23:46:37] <theseb> I don't know much but it seems to me that Docker and Kubernetes are the fundamental way to do software now....just like HTML/web took over the world it seems Docker + Kubernetes is taking over software...so we must all learn them cold yes?
[23:47:34] <systemfault> Docker? For sure, Kubernetes... mostly if you want to be devops/admin
[23:48:44] <BinarySavior> Docker is nice... the thing about docker is less to worry about as far as OPSEC goes... easy to implement changes and config is easy to track down
[23:49:22] <BinarySavior> i'm new to docker but for me with personal projects it's much easier to keep track of everything that's running and talking to each other

[23:51:12] <theseb> systemfault: a few Docker containers are fine if you run a donut shop but if you need automatic scaling then i don't see how you can avoid kubernetes since that is what it is for
[23:51:39] <BinarySavior> i never used kubernetes
[23:51:40] <EdFletcher> containers are not a simple panacea to security, container escapes are absolutely possible: https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/privilege-escalation/docker-breakout

[23:54:36] <systemfault> theseb: So you just want to argue for fun? I said that Kubernetes was mostly a devops/admin thing... Nobody is going to shame you if you're a dev and you're interested in it.
[23:54:38] <tempest> yeah - if you have root in the container it's equivalent to root in the host
[23:54:52] <tempest> also if you have write access to the docker daemon socket it's equivalent to root in the host
[23:55:01] <systemfault> Kubernetes knowledge is not something one expects from a norma JS dev
[23:55:14] <tempest> good for simple process isolation and easier management, it's not meant as a security tool
[23:56:03] <RLa> use lambda for backend and a cdn for frontend, no need to worry about automatic scaling yourself
[23:56:35] <RLa> kubernetes is probably the most complicated stuff ever, there are lots of horror stories on internet
[23:58:05] <systemfault> But any dev should be able to write a simple development dockerfile
