[00:01:55] <mario-goulart> We should make a self-contained CHICKEN distribution with tcc binaries and ship it with all possible eggs included.  Works anywhere for everything.
[00:02:39] <mario-goulart> Except maybe not everywhere and not for everything, though.
[00:05:08] <mario-goulart> But it would be a cool project.
[00:06:43] <mangol> CHICKEN + tcc is a really cool combo
[00:07:48] <jcowan> For GUI, I think ezd is the winner, because you talk to it in S-expressions.  There's a Chicken egg for the ezd server itself, but it's trivial to _use_ from any Lisp.
[00:12:16] <jcowan> You can use named pipes, stdin/stdout, or local sockets.
[00:12:29] <mario-goulart> Doesn't pstk work in a similar way?

[00:22:26] <Bunny351> ezd is megacool, only (slightly) buggy.
[00:23:00] <Bunny351> port it to SDL and it's perfect for games, graphics, even UI
[00:23:34] <Bunny351> pstk is widget based, and always a bit klunky. ezd has a relatively simple but easy to use object model
[00:24:00] <Bunny351> but one has to let go of the widget-y approach - you create objects and make them event-sensitive
[00:24:15] <Bunny351> ("don't fidget with widgets - draw!")
[00:24:21] <mario-goulart> I mean the way they interact with Scheme.
[00:24:29] <Bunny351> yes, similar

[22:24:38] <Bunny351> jcowan: no, it was just an idea
[22:25:07] <Bunny351> but a subset of ezd's functionality is possible. I wrote such a thing (sort of) for FLENG
[22:25:58] <Bunny351> still very basic, but usable (IMHO)
[22:48:44] <jcowan> link?
[22:53:33] <Bunny351> not public yet
[22:57:33] <Bunny351> only textures, lines, boxes, text. for the full set of graphical primitives the effort would be much greater.
