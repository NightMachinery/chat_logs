[00:00:47] <qergle> wikipedia is clearly out of control
[00:01:20] <Guest64> the dimension page is really confusing
[00:01:29] <Guest64> I thought there would be an easy quick definition..
[00:02:13] <cherim> I'd say reading Cox-Little-O'Shea without having any prior courses in algebraic geometry will always be confusing
[00:02:37] <cherim> It's fairly technical and a strange choice for the first book

[00:11:20] <droid3> O LLL actually is actually like a gram schmidt process with a Lovász condition for swapping
[00:12:19] <droid3> Curious is what version as of current of the LLL algorithm is used in the fastest GNFS aka the lattice sieving part of it?
[00:12:21] *** Quits: CatCow (~wtf_over@c-73-96-109-206.hsd1.or.comcast.net) (Quit: My MacBook Air has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[00:13:11] <droid3> I can implement the traditional LLL algorithm but i imagine alot of optimization has been done in the recent years for lattice sieving and the related SVP problem
[00:14:47] <droid3> Perhaps a optimize PSLQ algorithm as opposed to LLL??? Not sure still thinking on this.

[00:36:11] <droid3> Also a related issue with implementing optimized gnfs is how do we know an optimal way to choose the polynomials aka the polynomial selection part. The way i am first doing it is just the base-m representation f(m) = 0 mod N
[00:37:23] <droid3> but even this is not proven optimal even when we uses the lowest size coefficients in -m thru m

[00:39:57] <Guest64> cherim still around?
[00:40:04] <droid3> Anyway provable optimal LLL like algorithm for lattice sieving and a provable optimal polynomial selection is what i am after
[00:40:21] <droid3> Or to know whats current today on this.
[00:41:24] <droid3> polynomials seem to be the way to go but sense all polynomial arithmetic can be done in a matrix form maybe the more general way to create these x^2=y^2modN is thru matrix arithmetic
[00:41:51] <droid3> After all matrix arithmetic is more general then even UFD based integer domains.
[00:42:38] <droid3> And almost every finite ring can be represented as matrix over a finite field anyway.
[00:43:24] *** Quits: cantelope (~cantelope@mail.whitehotrobot.com) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:43:25] <droid3> we seem to focus on polynomials that are UFD and these can be realized most often as a matrix representation.
[00:44:31] <droid3> being not a UFD may give use more integer relations in the end.
[00:45:27] *** Joins: cantelope (~cantelope@mail.whitehotrobot.com)
[00:47:44] <droid3> So to me just brainstorming today. It seems matrices or polynomials are the only major options. Being polynomial representation cover all the finite fields and matrice representations cover all the finite rings

[00:48:44] <droid3> So if there exist a finite ring or finite field that is useful for creating such x^2=y^2 mod N relations it can be put into a polynomial arithmetic form or a matrice arithmetic form anyway.

[00:50:39] <droid3> As of current it seems GNFS is the best and it uses polynomials arithmetic over different fields but nothing say that matrice arithmetic cannt be more general as it encapsulates polynomial arithmetic and is more general
[00:52:02] <droid3> Plus the fact it would already be in matrix form to do out the Block Lanczos  part of the algorithm
[00:53:35] *** tos9_ is now known as Julian
[00:53:44] <droid3> So the equation becomes is matrix decomposition much harder then factoring polynomials over finite fields with variants of Berlekamp–Rabin algorithm or Evdokimov's algorithm
[00:54:35] <Guest64> droid, are you speaking to anyone?
[00:55:11] <droid3> no one in particular just brainstorming for a little while in the channel to see if anybody interested in talking about this stuff

[04:53:47] <Z-module> it's a weird way to write things, but yeah, just the usual  (a,b)(c,d) = (ac - bd, ad + bc)
[04:55:28] <Z-module> remember that (a,b) "really means"  a + ib
[04:55:49] <[itchyjunk]> so i got u^2 +2uvi -v^2 + u +iv +1 = 0
[04:55:56] <[itchyjunk]> so i sepereat real and imaginary parts
[04:56:05] <Z-module> yes

[04:57:54] <[itchyjunk]> right
[04:58:17] <[itchyjunk]> but i get either v = 0 or u = -1/2 with the im part
[04:58:31] <[itchyjunk]> then if i substitute it back, i get
[04:58:55] <[itchyjunk]> (-1/2,+-sqrt(3)/2)
[04:59:00] <[itchyjunk]> oh wait i guess it's not that weird
[04:59:07] <[itchyjunk]> just 2 possible solutions?
[04:59:24] <Z-module> it's a quadratic equation, so sure, only 2 solutions in C
[05:00:34] <[itchyjunk]> doh

[05:02:28] <[itchyjunk]> basically everything you'ed want for a field xD
[05:03:03] <jpearse> does anyone know a tutorial or some reasonably complete description of how the Real numbers are defined? .. something perhaps hopefully aimed at someone who has completed a high-school level of math with a good interest in the subject.

[05:03:19] <[itchyjunk]> reals are constructed in more than one way

[05:03:51] <[itchyjunk]> oh wait, you don't mean the field of reals..
[05:04:09] <[itchyjunk]> wait dedikind cut can be used to make the set of reals
[05:04:12] <Z-module> well, a degree-n polynomial has at most n roots in *any* integral domain, that part has nothing to do with C being algebraically complete.
[05:04:14] <[itchyjunk]> yeah! that's what we did
[05:04:21] <[itchyjunk]> right

[05:58:12] <Fangs> the group G can also be decomposed into conjugacy classes of a maximal torus
[05:59:20] <Fangs> I don't think that's a partition... the unit element has to be everywhere in the torus

[08:14:11] <Nickssen> https://imgur.com/a/aExQFAh
[08:14:41] <Nickssen> I have to take the line integral shown up top, but  he draws an ellipse that he calls C_epsilon
[08:14:55] <Nickssen> and he subtracts it from the bigger integral
[08:15:24] <Nickssen> almost as if he were removing the (0,0) point that indetermines the field, but why take a whole ellipse

[09:35:30] <Arcorann> Don't forget your brackets
[09:35:52] <silv3r_m00n2> that is also implicit
[09:36:58] <Fangs> silv3r_m00n2: let k = -h, and take the limit as k -> 0
[09:37:27] <silv3r_m00n2> the derivative is defined as = {f(x+h) - f(x)} / h | h -> 0  what happens if instead we do it like this  >>>  {f(x) - f(x-h)} / h | h -> 0

[09:45:50] <silv3r_m00n2> no i am not in class, am 35, just looking back at some basics
[09:46:09] <Galois> but the thing is, to really get to the actual truth of "why", you need to learn the actual definition. No shortcuts or hand waving or thinking that you can skip the hard work.
[09:46:21] *** Joins: cheater (~Username@user/cheater)
[09:46:45] <Galois> if you want to skip the hard work, then fine -- that is certainly an option. But you can't answer the hard questions if you skip the hard work.
[09:47:15] <Galois> here is a more or less correct actual definition of limit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_of_a_function#(%CE%B5,_%CE%B4)-definition_of_limit

[09:53:32] <Galois> understanding the formal definition of a limit is a widely acknowledged milestone in one's math education. It is a convenient and commonly encountered marker that separates rigorous math from pre-rigorous math. It can take years to progress past this milestone. So you shouldn't expect to get it in one night.
[09:54:07] <Galois> the fact that you are asking questions that lead you into this territory is a good sign. It means you are at least ready to walk up to the obstacle, if not get past it.
[09:57:05] <Galois> a pre-rigorous proof might be something like what Fangs suggested: let k = -h, then limit h->0 (f(x+h)-f(x))/h = limit k->0 (f(x+-k)-f(x))/(-k) = limit k->0 (f(x)-f(x-k))/k. You can even make this proof rigorous if you work hard enough. But this answer skips the necessary hard work to achieve actual understanding. If you don't know the definition then this is just pushing around symbols that you don't know the meaning of.
[09:58:27] <Galois> pushing around symbols does not lead to a sustainable math education. It eventually yields nonsense like 1+2+3+4+... = -1/12. And the problem is that if all you know is symbol-pushing, then you can't tell the difference between valid symbol-pushing and invalid symbol-pushing.

[12:11:39] <Juliu> int-e, it's very easy to interpolate more than just a few points
[12:11:48] <silv3r_m00n2> Juliu: lets say there are 12,500 cont functions through those 10 points, but the part of all those 12500 functions over the 10 points must be identical, if not how ?
[12:12:00] <int-e> emphasis on *some*
[12:12:35] <Juliu> silv3r_m00n2, you could modify your functions at all but those 10 positions to get new functions
[12:12:55] <Juliu> int-e, try splines for example
[12:13:27] <int-e> silv3r_m00n2: you can add *more* points more or less arbitrarily and interpolate; that alone will give you infinitely many functions
[12:14:29] <Juliu> This is precisely what something like "1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ?" is bullshit, since there are infinitely many solutions for "?"
[12:14:43] <Juliu> *what = why

[16:11:37] <barravince> in the image i shared
[16:11:58] <barravince> or it is  (-1)^(n+1) *(abs(sin(n))/n^4)
[16:12:38] <int-e> the latter

[16:13:21] <Juliu> The image does not contain an exercise. Just some formulas
[16:13:22] <Z-module> you can't actually raise a negative number to an irrational power anyway without getting into complex values
[16:13:48] <int-e> for the former, (n+1) would need parantheses and the bar of the fraction would have to be higher... and the denominator and numerator would be smaller.
[16:13:53] <Z-module> and |sin(n)|/n^4 is irrational for all natural n

[16:14:13] <Z-module> (in fact sin(x) is transcendental for all nonzero algebraic x)
[16:14:29] <int-e> I kind of understand the confusion, but the layout rules for fractions are strict enough to make this unambiguous
[16:14:30] <barravince> therefore i can use the alternating serier test as |sin(n)|/n^4 tends to 0 as n goes to infinity
[16:14:52] <barravince> the question is to check if each of them diverges/converges
[16:15:02] <Z-module> remember you need the terms to -> in an eventually monotonic way for that test
[16:15:06] <Z-module> to -> 0
[16:15:42] <Z-module> so you can't use it here, in fact
[16:16:07] <Juliu> I would guess that (a) converges, but I have no clue of math anyway
[16:17:48] <Z-module> To see a crude case where the test doesn't work, with terms that -> 0 non-monotonically, consider  1/1 - 1/2^2 + 1/3 - 1/4^2 + 1/5 - 1/6^2 + ...
[16:19:07] <Juliu> I would guess that (b) converges as well, and (c) diverges
[16:19:15] <Z-module> but there's a very quick way to show (a) converges

[16:27:30] <rubiksdream> as has been said, you can't use the alternating series test for (a), but you can just take the absolute valued version of that series and notice it converges

[17:04:13] <river> maybe not quite as easy as i thought

[17:04:19] <rubiksdream> yeah i dont think its easy
[17:04:20] <river> you may need uniform distribution?

[17:10:55] <Z-module> What makes it hard is that the values of sin(n)  (natural n) are dense in [-1,1] and the behavior of this series depends on "exactly how often and how fast" those values get close to -1
[17:11:40] <PlanckWalk> For small epsilon the density of terms such that  1 + sin(n) < epsilon  is roughly proportional to  sqrt(epsilon).
[17:12:14] <Juliu> Just pick 2 consecutive terms, one has a positive and one a negative sign. In the positive sign plug in 1 for sin, and in the negative 0 for sin. This maximizes the sum, and yet the sum still converges. Proof done
[17:13:25] <Z-module> (those are dense in [-1,1] because the values  n mod 2pi  are dense in [0, 2pi]  because  n/(2pi) are dense in [0,1]  because 1/(2pi) is irrational)

[17:23:03] <DnzAtWrk> is there such a thing as local frequency spectrum normalization
[17:23:23] <PlanckWalk> 1/(2 pi)  being transcendental is well-approximable, so it's probably worse than this density argument implies.
[17:23:24] <Juliu> If 1/n^(2 + sin(n)) converges depends on the ratio how often you hit a multiple of Pi vs something else, I'd say
[17:24:23] <Juliu> and since you will never hit a multiple of Pi, it will converge

[20:23:59] <droid3> It seems then that any abstract algebra object we cook up that falls into being a ring or finite field can be model as matrices or polynomials as arithmetic...one needs not learn any thing other then matrices and polynomial arithmetic to beable to do arithmetic for any ring or finite field.

[20:34:42] <droid3> ya was kind of figuring that. So only simple rings can be expressed / represented completely by a ring of nxn matrice over a division ring.
[20:34:53] <droid3> Not all rings!!! :(
[20:36:01] <droid3> though if the simple ring is finite it reduce to being isomorphic to a ring of nxn matrices over a field trivially
[20:36:15] <droid3> Because any finite division ring is a field
[20:37:12] <droid3> At any extent so classification of rings in general that arent simple is still unknown like the classification of all finite groups is still unknown.

[21:07:33] <droid3> and there is still finite noncommutative rings the even worse case
[21:08:35] <droid3> So i guess what i am still wondering is do we have any theorems saying commutative finite rings can be represented as a matrix nxn group over some finite field or ring ???
[21:11:08] <droid3> And can every finite noncommutative ring be represented thru matrices
[21:12:27] <Z-module> If S is any finite commutative ring, then (Z/4Z) x S contains at least one nonzero nilpotent element, namely (2,0), so by a known theorem, (Z/4Z) x S can't be semisimple (= direct sum of simple rings). So there's a nice infinite family of finite non-semisimple rings.
[21:12:42] <droid3> I suppose the first question is trivial if we represent it as a module over itself or as a 1x1 matrice as an module
[21:13:17] <droid3> But i suppose the better statement is can in general all finite rings be represented as a matrice over some field?
[21:14:03] <droid3> Obviously all finite rings can be represented as a 1x1 matrice over itself but thats kind of a trivial representation thats not so useful.
[21:15:17] <droid3> YA THE QUESTION IS CAN ALL FINITE RINGS BE REPRESENTED AS A NXN MATRIX OVER A FINITE FIELD?

[21:18:52] <droid3> ya but i can see by n^2 elements in a matrice and p^m we have p^m^n2 orders achievable thru matrices
[21:18:57] <Z-module> The full ring of n x n matrices over a field of order p^k (p prime) has order  p^(k n^2).   So no finite ring whose order has two or more prime factors will be such a thing.
[21:19:38] <droid3> Ya so i can kind of see that it wouldnt work as then you just have to show a finite ring of order not equal to p^^m^n^2

[21:23:52] <droid3> Ya your right you really need the commutative to make arithmetic really work well .
