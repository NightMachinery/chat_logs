[20:08:49] <headius> ahorek: good finds on those jit runs
[20:09:15] <headius> a few minor things (tainting lol) but we need to look into the others
[20:12:20] <ahorek[m]> hey headius ! I was wondering why these autoload tests are passing on Travis and found this.
[20:13:30] <ahorek[m]> this one is interesting
[20:13:30] <ahorek[m]> Literal Regexps caches the Regexp object FAILED
[20:13:30] <ahorek[m]> Expected /foo/ to be identical to /foo/
[20:14:35] <headius> yeah that one is a little concerning
[20:14:52] <headius> but probably easy to fix and hard to affect real code
[20:15:10] <ahorek[m]> y
[20:16:28] <ahorek[m]> btw https://github.com/ruby/spec/issues/835 I think it's ok?
[21:03:21] <headius> 16.0.1 that identifies as 17?
[21:03:45] <headius> JRuby 9.2.x does not have any work in it to support M1 but JRuby 9.3 will be closer
[21:03:51] <headius> we will get that released this month
[21:29:35] <headius> oh using homebrew... yeah beats me how they decide what to install
[21:29:55] <headius> I would recommend prepackaged builds like azul or adoptopenjdk or whatever it is called now
[21:30:11] <headius> rebelwarrior: you could give a JRuby 9.3 snapshot a try and see how it goes
[21:30:21] <headius> I just had to send my apple silicon DTK back and have not picked up a new machine yet
[21:30:35] <headius> but I shall!
[21:36:36] <headius> https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/jruby/jruby-dist/9.3.0.0-SNAPSHOT/
[21:36:45] <headius> those are built on every successful push

[21:42:25] <rebelwarrior[m]> ok
[21:42:25] <rebelwarrior[m]> Thanks! Yes if you install the newest version of openjdk on an M1 using homebrew it will install a beta package that identifies as 17 because: "This is a beta version of openjdk for Apple Silicon
[21:42:25] <rebelwarrior[m]> (openjdk 17 preview)." 
[21:42:25] <rebelwarrior[m]> Hi! I got a new macbook air M1 and got openjdk@16.0.1 which identifies as java "17" and jruby won't run with it. I also got the azul openjdk@11 and jruby won't run with it. Is my only option trying to do with rosetta 2?
[21:42:25] <rebelwarrior[m]> I was able to start irb without issue. Let me see if I figure out how to install the snapshot, I've never done that before. 
[21:46:47] <rebelwarrior[m]> works for me, just need to figure out where to put it path wise etc.
[22:19:14] <rebelwarrior[m]> OMG the installation was super simple. Dragged the uncompressed folder to the ~/.rbenv/versions folder and `rbenv rehash` and done. At least I think it's done. 
[22:27:01] <headius> nice!
[23:48:37] <rebelwarrior[m]> It didn't work I get the same error as before: `NotImplementedError: waitpid unsupported or native support failed to load; see https://github.com/jruby/jruby/wiki/Native-Libraries
[23:48:37] <rebelwarrior[m]>   waitpid at org/jruby/RubyProcess.java:936`
[23:49:44] <rebelwarrior[m]> Oh well it was worth the try. Works ok for gems that are pure ruby like pry it seems. 
[23:50:04] <headius> once I have an M1 device again I will finish up the support
[23:50:24] <headius> how did you trigger that error?
[23:50:51] <headius> to answer your earlier question, yes it should work fine with rosetta but will be somewhat slower of course

[23:58:28] <headius> rebelwarrior: duh I just connected the dots with your twitter account
[23:58:29] <headius> I guess we can continue the conversation here
