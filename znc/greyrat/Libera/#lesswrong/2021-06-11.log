[01:01:53] <dbohdan> galambo_: Social media, food, drinks, and other things are designed to be addictive.  I suspect video games are less addictive than Twitter and less harmful than fattening food.

[01:38:04] <galambo_> michael huemer thinks the solution is to be as hands-off as possible and only make legislation if there is strong evidence that the policy will bring a huge amount of benefit
[01:38:50] <galambo_> moldbug thinks the solution is to give the power to one person (a ceo) and let them do what they think is right without worrying about 'politics'

[01:48:01] <RiversHaveWings> i can't believe he doesn't allow you to use GPUs either
[01:49:07] <RiversHaveWings> as a result the hutter prize seems to have been ignored by AI researchers
[01:50:09] <kuudes> you could do the compression with a gpu as long as you can do the decompression with the cpu?
[01:50:26] <RiversHaveWings> kuudes: no, he makes you submit the compressor and he runs it
[01:50:37] <kuudes> oh? yeah, that sucks
[01:51:27] <RiversHaveWings> i.e. to qualify he would have to be able to train the model on cpu

[01:53:50] <RiversHaveWings> Apparently he has an anti-GPU stance

[01:55:10] <RiversHaveWings> idk how you are supposed to get anything done that way
[01:55:16] <kuudes> but the compressor program is allowed to be a quine
[01:55:29] <saturn2> oh wow, how ridiculous
[01:55:32] <kuudes> ie you can just ignore the data and have it produce a constant decryptor
[01:55:51] <kuudes> or well, I guess the compressor program could just rename itself to archive.exe
[01:55:59] <RiversHaveWings> "The primary reason for excluding GPUs is that they stifle creative/innovative ideas. Any algorithmic ideas that cannot (easily or at all) be vectorized are disadvantaged compared to vectorizable algorithms. As an example, sparse Neural Networks seem to be superior to dense ones but have a hard time reaping the benefits on GPUs and TPUs. If non-vectorizable algorithms start to consistently beat vectorizable ones CPUs, this will 
[01:55:59] <RiversHaveWings> drive hardware innovation to support whatever special structure (e.g. sparcity) these novel algorithms may have. Using CPUs levels the playing field."
[01:56:35] <kuudes> I mean, the obvious thing is to move the computation out of the box
[01:57:12] <kuudes> you do not *have* to run the compression, you just have to have an exe that produces an exe that when run produces enwik9
[01:57:50] <kuudes> the source and the "compressor computer" are free resources, but I don't see anywhere how he ascertains you use either of them
[01:58:11] <kuudes> ie you could make an ai to make you a compressor
[01:58:22] <kuudes> and the ai would not be part of your submission
[01:58:55] <kuudes> this would be against the spirit from his pov, I think, but not against the rules as written
[01:59:32] <kuudes> the compressor program is not required to be universal
[01:59:44] <kuudes> so you can just do the "" -> constant -> enwik9
[02:00:39] <kuudes> so indeed a precompressed archive.exe is an option

[02:01:30] <kuudes> or how do you guys see this?
[02:01:42] <RiversHaveWings> nshepperd: there was someone on eleutherai just now who actually got their autoregressive VQGAN token transformer to overfit
[02:01:48] <RiversHaveWings> loss near zero
[02:03:08] <nshepperd> what dataset
[02:03:13] <RiversHaveWings> they didn't say
[02:03:24] <RiversHaveWings> however their model was big enough to be capable of memorizing it
[02:03:41] <RiversHaveWings> it was like 1B on a small dataset
[02:03:44] <nshepperd> overfitting is always a good start
[02:03:47] <RiversHaveWings> yeah
[02:04:00] <RiversHaveWings> they added augmentation and it stopped overfitting
[02:04:14] <RiversHaveWings> i can't even get mine to overfit :/
[02:04:17] <RiversHaveWings> on ms coco
[02:04:54] <RiversHaveWings> which is like 29M VQGAN tokens if you resize to 256x256 and don't augment
[02:09:11] <nshepperd> kuudes: that won't work
[02:11:39] <kuudes> why?
[02:11:48] <gwern> as I said, it's data||model
[02:12:11] <gwern> so you can submit a literal copy, but it'll be beaten by literally almost anything
[02:12:12] <nshepperd> well, it will work, but your compression needs to be twice as good then, since both your program and the output count

[02:33:57] <RiversHaveWings> (so how is the evaluation of perplexity done exactly, if you just divide the text up into 2048 token blocks and take the perplexity for each, you get a higher number than if you shift by 1024 tokens each time and take the perplexity on the last 1024)
[02:34:15] <RiversHaveWings> (and the latter way is more representative of the actual data compression ability of the model)
[02:34:57] <gwern> I would expect it to be done 1 token at a time except for the first 2047 when the context window is still filling up
[02:35:04] <gwern> that is how you would stream/compress data
[02:35:08] <RiversHaveWings> that's super slow though
[02:35:16] <gwern> oh is it? too bad
[02:35:32] <RiversHaveWings> i think gpt-2 was evaled in context_window token blocks by openai?
[02:35:49] <RiversHaveWings> and someone else did the shift by half context window thing later and got a better number?
[02:37:29] <RiversHaveWings> you have to decompress that way
[02:37:36] <RiversHaveWings> but for compression you can go a lot faster

[13:54:50] <kuudes> how do you guys see, when vaccination progresses, should your country open or close borders or keep them same or how?
[14:28:49] <quanticle> Of course open.
[14:29:03] <quanticle> Why would you keep your borders closed if you have ~60% vaccinated?
[14:29:10] <quanticle> That seems anti-science
[14:36:36] <Mark_> why would you have closed them in the first place? closing borders slows down vaccine production, distribution, etc. after all
[14:38:03] <Urchin[emacs]> Mark_: containing worse variants, preventing new outbreak clusters, etc.
[14:38:16] <Urchin[emacs]> Mark_: also, not all countries deal with vaccine production
[14:38:21] <Mark_> how well has that worked?
[14:38:51] <Urchin[emacs]> Mark_: better than letting everybody get covid
[14:38:52] <Mark_> *have* worse variants been contained? *have* new outbreak clusters been prevented?
[14:39:08] <Mark_> most transmission is local
[14:39:18] <Mark_> people keep pretending this isn’t the case
[14:40:17] <Urchin[emacs]> it's a fucking exponentially spreading virus, letting a bunch of people in that are infected only lets you have "local" transmission from people from elsewhere
[14:41:15] <Mark_> the variants have totally gotten into countries while they had border closures
[14:41:26] <Urchin[emacs]> besides, nobody fully closes borders without a damn good reason
[14:41:37] <Mark_> uh
[14:41:46] <Urchin[emacs]> Mark_: then that's not local
[14:42:06] <Mark_> Urchin[emacs]: my point is that the border closures haven’t prevented variants getting in
[14:42:49] <Mark_> nor have they prevented the majority of transmission from happening, since it is local
[14:42:56] <Urchin[emacs]> Mark_: the mink variant was prevented from getting out
[14:43:22] <Mark_> by border closures, you think?

[15:11:04] <feep[work]> Mark_: all I can say is, as a german, when chechnya had like two or three times as many infections as us, you could very clearly tell where the chechen border was from an infection map
[15:11:22] <feep[work]> it was the line where all the adjacent counties were "highly infected"
[15:11:43] <feep[work]> policy differences and culture differences create sharp spread gradients at country borders
[15:11:53] <feep[work]> this is why closing borders makes sense, *because* spread is local
[15:11:58] <feep[work]> (but not uniform)
[15:13:45] <feep[work]> er, whatever that country is called in english, hang on
[15:14:22] <feep[work]> czechia**
[15:17:13] <feep[work]> of course, we didn't do it anyway cause then we'd seen how much of the german economy is driven by not necessarily registered guest workers lol
[15:20:47] <nshepperd> clearly border closures make no difference to the spread of viruses, since germ theory isn't real and diseases are spread by insufficient faith
[15:21:00] <feep[work]> :P
[15:21:28] <Mark_> they obviously make a difference but what is the sign?
[15:21:53] <feep[work]> the ... very visible coloration on the infection map? I just talked about this
[15:22:24] <feep[work]> what more of a sign do you want
[15:22:35] <Mark_> for binary outcomes it’s easier to prove the absence of a causal link than its presence
[15:22:40] <Mark_> feep[work]: no, I mean the sign of the difference
[15:22:45] <Mark_> as in, positive or negative
[15:22:50] <feep[work]> oh. positive.
[15:23:15] <feep[work]> because of like ... I'm not sure if I even need to explain this model
[15:23:17] <feep[work]> it's like asking
[15:23:32] <feep[work]> "if you contact a hot object and a cold object, does the cold one get hotter ..... or colder??"
[15:23:43] <Mark_> no
[15:23:43] <feep[work]> it's not exactly a deep mystery.
[15:23:45] <Mark_> it’s not like acting that
[15:24:26] <feep[work]> kinda is.
[15:24:38] <Mark_> the hot object in the analogy generates objects that move around and themselves generate multiplicatively growing amounts of heat
[15:24:41] <feep[work]> look, I have a model, I have evidence, you have a vague speculation.
[15:25:43] <feep[work]> my model *literally only* requires the claim that adjacent countries can have different spread rates.
[15:26:59] <feep[work]> the only case where closing borders doesn't immediately, obviously help, is if the border does not have an infection gradient *and* the countries don't have a spread gradient.
[15:27:13] <feep[work]> I fail to consider this plausible.
[15:27:49] <Mark_> and one question is then whether enough of these objects will get close enough to the cold object even if the hot object is not in contact with it that there will be little enough difference in the limiting behavior of the heat scaling for other factors going in the opposite direction to outweigh any difference
[15:28:24] <Mark_> the germ theory of disease does not give an answer to this question
[15:28:28] <feep[work]> right, and I think there is in fact a huge difference in the heat scaling.
[15:31:12] <feep[work]> (which we can tell from the way that czechia had 156k per million cases and germany had a peak of 44k pm)

Our system 1) lifts a floorplan image to a 3D mesh model; 2) synthesizes surface textures based on the input photos; and 3) infers textures for unobserved surfaces using a graph neural network architecture. To train and evaluate our system we create
[19:03:33] <dbohdan2> indoor surface texture datasets, and augment a dataset of floorplans and photos from prior work with rectified surface crops and additional annotations. Our approach handles the challenge of producing tileable textures for dominant surfaces such as floors, walls, and ceilings from a sparse set of unaligned photos that only partially cover the residence. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that
[19:03:35] <dbohdan2> our system produces realistic 3D interior models, outperforming baseline approaches on a suite of texture quality metrics and as measured by a holistic user study.'
