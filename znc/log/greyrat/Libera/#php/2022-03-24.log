[00:38:29] <php-bot> The X-Y problem is when you want to do X, but you don't know how. You think you can hack X if you can just do Y, but you don't know how to do Y either. You ask (us) for help with Y. We think Y is a strange problem to want to solve... So just ask us about X. [See: http://xyproblem.info/ ]

[02:49:11] <TML> jenntech: __adrian's suggestion is to enable logging in the PHP configuration - neither the browser, nor phpmyadmin, but PHP itself.
[02:49:14] <__adrian> everywhere, but specifically i meant in php
[02:49:20] <__adrian> !+error logging
[02:49:20] <php-bot> In addition to configuring error reporting (/msg php-bot error reporting), set log_errors=1 and error_log=/path/to/your/error.log in your php.ini file. This allows you to simply tail the log to see errors, and to disable display_errors (e.g., during production).
[02:49:55] <jenntech> so can i copy that exact string into php.ini?

[03:26:17] <Blondie101010> if they can't get a LE cert, they're weird
[03:26:52] <Sammitch> they probably never figured out how to make certbot update ddosguard and just stopped caring, which is a huge red flag

[03:29:43] <Blondie101010> dag:  do both sites run on the same machine?
[03:30:39] <Blondie101010> but you just have to use the proper URL to avoid the cert issue

[03:31:52] <Blondie101010> and unneeded for this case
[03:32:15] <Blondie101010> the site that does the redirect should not have a fake cert
[03:32:20] <dag> i understand the implications
[03:32:33] <Blondie101010> no cert is better than a bad one
[03:35:44] <dag> it was actually file_get_contents() that was initiating the operation.

[03:37:27] <php-bot> look at the context, string file_get_contents(string filename [, long flags [, resource context [, long offset [, long maxlen]]]])  - Read the entire file into a string - http://php.net/file_get_contents

[05:03:46] <lembron> well given there samplecode _literally_ is the for-each method, i´d guess iterator_to_array() cant be that bad in the case... https://apidocs.chargebee.com/docs/api/invoices?prod_cat_ver=2#list_invoices
[05:04:20] <__adrian> "can't be that bad"?
[05:04:48] <TML> I don't know what "that bad" means, but sure - iterator_to_array() isn't without purpose.
[05:04:52] <__adrian> what are you trying to solve
[05:04:54] <Sammitch> iterator_to_array() is a waste of an iterator
[05:05:06] <lembron> return array_map(function($item){ return $item->Invoice(); }, iterator_to_array(\ChargeBee\ChargeBee\Models\Invoice::all([...])));
[05:05:20] <TML> Sounds like some 3rd party code is giving lembron an Iterator when they really wanted an array
[05:05:31] <__adrian> sure
[05:05:41] <__adrian> but could easily be a reason for that
[05:06:21] <Sammitch> are you just going to feed that array into another loop, or do you need the _entire_ thing all at once for an actual reason?
[05:07:29] <lembron> return infront, so "whole thing" if i understand that question correctly
[05:07:51] <Sammitch> Upstream Developer: "we're going to return an iterator here so that we don't blow out the memory usage" Downstream Developer: [uses iterator_to_array()] "ugh this lib sucks, it uses too much memory"
[05:07:59] <__adrian> ^
[05:08:37] <TML> Sure, but I feel we've sign-posted the issue well enough, lembron's going to do what they're going to do :)
[05:08:42] <__adrian> or "... so we don't have to wait for dozens of api requests to come back"  "ugh this lib sucks, it's so slow"

[05:11:02] <TML> lembron: It *does* appear from your sample code there that foreach() would be a perfectly reasonable solution
[05:11:14] <lembron> ye its more of a "feeling" thing for sure - the mempoint i totally get... but i cant have the iterator run all the way into the template yet... - as i actually stuff "invocie lists" from 3 different systems sorted by date into another in the end ;D
[05:12:11] <Blondie101010> so that's where your data becomes an array
[05:12:20] <Sammitch> foreach( Invoice::all([...]) as $item ) { yield $item->Invoice; }
[05:12:44] <Sammitch> are the lists themselves naturally in sorted order?
[05:14:06] <Blondie101010> you want to merge them linearly?
[05:14:07] <lembron> each on there own? yes, but i "mix" em and even need some formating inbetween on some - backend export job, so not to bad if its a lil dirty :P
[05:14:32] <lembron> (my "template" is a export for finance -.-)

[19:26:57] <freeman_h> Hi guys got a weird. I got 1,542 array of stdclass object which I am trying to json encode e.g. $json = json_encode($arrayOfStdClassObject); . The issue is that $json = false; however when testing it with some dummer data https://3v4l.org/qHPtM8 it is okay
[19:27:47] <da_wunder> freeman_h: use option to throw an exception with json_encode to see what is actually wrong
[19:28:02] <__adrian> https://php.net/json_encode  JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR
[19:28:37] <freeman_h> da_wunder, with option because json_last_error_msg() says "No error"
[19:28:54] <Naktibalda> freeman_h: your code works: https://3v4l.org/q7utq
[19:29:21] <freeman_h> Naktibalda, I know it works on that link but on my dev environment its not
[19:29:31] <freeman_h> maybe because the dev has over 1k data or something
[19:29:36] <Naktibalda> so get exception in your dev environment
[19:29:42] <__adrian> freeman_h: showing us code that works doesn't help us point you in a good troubleshooting direction
[19:30:04] <__adrian> highly recommend JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR, but check one way or the other.
[19:30:18] <freeman_h> __adrian, want me to great 1,654 std class object to show you?
[19:30:21] <__adrian> no
[19:30:34] *** Quits: magla (~gelignite@55d40a33.access.ecotel.net) (Quit: Stay safe!)
[19:30:38] <__adrian> you should check for errors and narrow it down to a small, reproducible test case
[19:30:38] <da_wunder> freeman_h: also note that JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR option was added on PHP 7.3.0 so make sure that you're using at least that version
[19:30:51] <freeman_h> __adrian, okay the flag tells me whats up, "Malformed UTF-8 characters, possibly incorrectly encoded"
[19:31:04] <__adrian> k
[19:31:14] <freeman_h> doesnt really help me find out what might be what
[19:31:16] <__adrian> so, check your text. it must all be utf-8
[19:31:48] <__adrian> loop over your objects and check. make sure your process ensures utf-8 in general.
[19:34:01] <freeman_h> __adrian, think might know what might be cause it
[19:34:46] <freeman_h> the data is created from something to a csv and then my code picks it up and do some stuff and then to json
[19:35:09] <__adrian> your code should convert to utf-8 if necessary and normalize
[19:35:15] <freeman_h> think when the csv is getting created, needs to be utf8 encoded
[19:35:26] <__adrian> yes
[19:35:34] <__adrian> your code should still be checking though

[21:07:00] <freeman_h> Hi, got this small example https://3v4l.org/hlsrm basically want I want to check if they are the same by the same, I am not speaking of arrangement which in my example it is, however both array are the same

[21:19:53] <alien_lappy> ok, i have some Closure weirdness: https://3v4l.org/MJkpT ; but i realized i don't need to bindTo on this Closure::fromCallable() , because it was started from a method on an object...
[21:19:54] *** Joins: hh (~g@37.214.75.10)
[21:20:02] <alien_lappy> how can i detect this and not have this error
[21:20:21] <alien_lappy> so, i want to detect if this Closure is already bound? i guess?

[21:23:12] <coder7of9> what is the implication of having a class with    function sleep(){...}
[21:23:38] <Naktibalda> coder7of9: it isn't magic method
[21:23:44] <Naktibalda> do you mean __sleep ?
[21:24:24] <coder7of9> i am encountering a function named sleep in a class.   i want to make sure there is no collision with php sleep.     from my tests it appears okay... just asking

[21:24:41] <Naktibalda> methods aren't functions
[21:25:37] <coder7of9> global php sleep will not be affected by a class with a function of the same name?   it appears okay
[21:26:12] <alien_lappy> i tried with this: https://3v4l.org/Tp45X#v7.4.28 but that didn't work
[21:27:30] <alien_lappy> can anyone tell me how i can find out of a Closure is bound? i cannot check with "$closure->this" it doesn't work, even though var_dump() tells me there is a this

[21:43:49] <alien_lappy> i tried to use reflection to get the this of the closure, but that didn't quite work, because both are bound, just one can be rebound and the other can't
[21:43:53] <alien_lappy> for some reason
[21:44:07] <alien_lappy> plz does anyone know of a better way?

[21:49:26] <alien_lappy> teresko: I donno, i have Closures that are anonymous functions which i rebind to the current object when i use them; but there are some that are from $methods, which are already bound and since i specified it, i want to keep the object bound, well, the bindTo() errors out anyway on those, but there is no real way to detect which is which
[21:50:01] <teresko> and what problem are you trying to solve that way?
[21:50:29] <alien_lappy> that i can use both anonous functions and method functions for a specific function
[21:50:38] <alien_lappy> specific usage
[21:50:58] <teresko> no, taht is the bugfix for your current solution

[22:19:54] <lembron> phpstan - my 'universalObjectCratesClasses'-entry has a $allowed param the getter checks, so as i understand ill have to create a new, similar-looking service todo the reflection and slightly alter one of the calls? but what... i dont rly understand there docs, and there is nothing on examples - anything that i find (like there universalObjectCratesClasses-extension) seems _way_ overcomplicated
[22:19:55] <lembron> - and investigating things is a bit harsh when all params are 250mb of var_dump :D
