[13:05:24] <jajaja> btw, how can i increment a timestamp like this 202109111030.10 (%m%d%H%M%s) by one sec?
[13:06:16] <pj> jajaja: The thing is that changing the timestamp of files for something that doesn't actually have much to do with the actual timestamp of the file is generally not a good idea.  There are ways in which various programs and even in some cases the system itself relies on those timestamps that could cause issues.
[13:06:33] <pj> they are not there as a sort marker for the files.
[13:07:43] <jajaja> first i need to make them in cirrect order and that i can do only byt changing the timestamp

[13:36:39] <jajaja> date '+%m%d%H%M%S'
[13:36:44] <earendel> its like a variable. imagine u need to run node in 3 versions. you could adjust this in the environment vars. so u dont need to change the shebang in each. for instance. a typical stub?

[13:38:08] <earendel> that things i only slowly start to grasp. everything is somehow stubbed, and sys is build by creating sym links into stage dirs.. then some other process builds all things together which you then do not edit.

[14:31:58] <pj> yep, the advantage there of the ere is if you want to save off both the prefix and the rest.  Also I don't think it matters to anchor the end of that ere because * should be greedy.

[14:37:58] <emanuele6> i think POSIX does not define that. you should only use strictly POSIX EREs in bash since bash does not actually implement EREs, but simply uses the system's regex.h
[14:38:09] <pj> right
[14:38:35] <pj> I'm more used to perl regex (or PCRE), tbh.

[16:04:53] <pyzozord> is there a way of doing that without changing IFS for the entire environment? I tired IFS="|" echo but that doesn't seem to work
[16:06:22] <phogg> no, but you can usually use a subshell
[16:06:40] *** Quits: john_johnk (~Thunderbi@112.54.140.77.rev.sfr.net) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[16:07:21] <phogg> also, for files containing pipes you can quote the file names in the concat filter e.g. -i "concat:'$file1'|'$file2'" but to be safe you must escape ' that may appear within the file name
[16:07:55] <pyzozord> is chaning IFS +  subshel the most elegant to solve this?
[16:08:06] <pyzozord> elegant/idiomatic
[16:10:51] <emanuele6> pj: also semicolons, brackets, and other special characters for ffmpeg
[16:11:04] <emanuele6> that is basically a code injection, you should not use it at all
[16:11:46] <phogg> you can quote the strings as I described above, which I believe will make everything safe (except quote itself)
[16:12:05] <phogg> not sure how ffmpeg handled \n and other control sequences, though

[19:19:37] <twkm>        This  type  of  redirection  instructs the shell to read input from the

[19:42:35] <emanuele6> you are right that /dev/null is not
