[00:31:36] <sobel> truly
[00:32:45] <sobel> my biggest eye-opener has been that a timestamp in local time doesn't move (e.g. appointment at 9am) but the UTC position of 9am in my locale could change several times before the appointment
[00:34:30] <sobel> so UTC, while a great coordinate system, actually yields constant failure when it is used *in lieu of* local time
[00:34:34] <Para> Move the universe around you.
[00:35:28] <sobel> heuristic: convert local to UTC "after the fact" or as lazily as possible (most display cases)
[00:38:12] <ridcully_> same for future and past...

[07:31:42] <seebs> so if i wanted to print a character if and only if it's "printable", presumably the simplest way is to read up on FFI, write a C library that exports isprint(), and call that, because obviously no one would already have implemented such an obscure thing.

[21:56:08] <v3ga> a bit of confusion here. is it possible for emacs/cider to hold dirty state data? Like I can make a change to my route...and restart things via integrant...and things still aren't working properly. So i'll restart nrepl which i start from my terminal...outside of emacs. still doesn't work. Kill emacs and bring it back up..and then things work.
[21:56:25] <technomancy> v3ga: yeah happens all the time
[21:56:27] <v3ga> also i make sure to kill my connection/repl in emacs when i stop nrepl.
[21:56:37] <technomancy> it's called "getting slimed"
[21:56:41] <v3ga> technomancy: ok, I just wanted to make sure I wasn't completely crazy...
[21:57:04] <technomancy> reloading a namespace doesn't clear it out, so if you delete a def and reload, the namespace will still have the old copy from the initial load
[21:57:35] <v3ga> lol any relation to common lisp/slime?  so whats the deal with some people saying they keep the same repl for months? what else can you do beyond reloading?
[21:57:57] <technomancy> yeah before nrepl was created people used the CL slime client for clojure too
[21:58:28] <technomancy> I keep the same repl going for weeks; it's not uncommon. the cases in which you get bitten are definitely rare.
[21:59:51] <technomancy> months is pushing it; usually a new dependency would get added before that, which I restart for
[22:00:00] <v3ga> for me..it's generally with route changes and being able to send/receive json data. drives me crazy. last night I had a route work..then for 10 min it didn't work until I shut everything down... and I don't believe I made any code changes. in fact I couldn't have because I saved and shut down
[22:00:24] <technomancy> you can stop your ring server or whatever without stopping the whole JVM
[22:00:48] <v3ga> technomancy: yeah..thats what I use integrant for... normally that WOULD work... but it wasn't the case last night
[22:00:59] <technomancy> hm; never tried integrant so I couldn't say
[22:01:27] <ridcully_> v3ga: are you passing a var in as handler?  if not that might be the problem you are facing
[22:01:52] <technomancy> honestly if you're just getting started I think integrant/component/whatever just gets in the way

[22:02:33] <technomancy> stopping a jetty server manually is much easier early on
[22:03:28] <v3ga> ridcully_: i am... 
[22:05:16] <v3ga> funny  i went back to pedestal...strangely I like the errors more. with ring/jetty when I get a 404 or 500 it kicks that to the repl and there's no stacktrace. I'd have to write my own exceptions in I suppose. Pedestal seems to already have that in their chain so I may stick with it.  
[22:06:30] <v3ga> pededstal actually isn't bad now that i've spent some time with ring and really have an understanding of req/res maps.  I added a namespace and toyed around for 2 hours and i'm already back to where I was with my ring/jetty playing around.  but with absolute errors. it damn sure tells me where i've messed up.
[22:07:18] <v3ga> ridcully_: so better to go (defn routes []...) huh?
[22:10:24] <v3ga> technomancy: yeah, it can be... i'm a bit masochistic. for the most part it's giving me what I want at the moment... i've written my own functions to stop and start the server as well. I have a 'junk yard' of code here.
[22:10:44] <v3ga> <- extreme ADHD 
[22:12:24] <seebs> "extreme" hah
[22:12:50] <seebs> i once had a firecracker blow up in my hand (no serious injuries yay) because i forgot about it after lighting the fuse
[22:13:07] <ridcully_> hard to remote diagnose.  i asked for the #'handler, because that is one of the first problems one run into
[22:13:21] <v3ga> seebs: lol
[22:14:23] <ridcully_> integrant uses multi methods.  aren't those hard to reload?
[22:15:50] <v3ga> ridcully_: hmm, i'll pay attention tonight and try both ways.  it looks like i'm not using a var at the moment but I definitely did earlier on last night.  
[22:16:47] <v3ga> beats me on integrant...I don't know what i'm doing yet...I just make things move.  multimethods are a problem? I liked integrant more than mount and component...at first glance. i'm open though...
[22:17:08] <v3ga> i'll have my own system in time...
[22:17:26] <seebs> hmm
[22:17:33] <v3ga> seebs: yeah, i'm not that bad...but I definitely move at 1000mph or 0. 
[22:18:01] <seebs> okay, so i want to do a thing that i know how to do in other languages but it's less obvious to me in something like clojure, which is i want to do something for every item in a sequence, but do it differently for the last item
[22:18:49] <seebs> like, say, print ├ before most lines of something, but └ before the last one.
[22:18:51] <v3ga> why not grab all but the last?
[22:19:38] <v3ga> actually let me shut up...i'd like to see a answer to this as well...
[22:20:29] <seebs> i guess? my intuition is that (take (- 1 (count obj)) obj) would be expensive, i suppose a loop-with-index type construct could do it?
[22:20:34] <seebs> although that won't help for a map.
[22:21:08] <v3ga> can you do the last one first? then handle the rest?
[22:21:55] <v3ga> clojure has "butlast"
[22:22:51] <v3ga> i'm sure there are several more that do the same...
[22:24:11] <seebs> (butlast) is linear time, i was hoping to avoid that. i guess it doesn't matter in principle because the operation is linear time anyway, since i'm doing something for every item.
[22:25:03] <seebs> but it feels like being able to do the iteration once, but know where in it i am, would be useful.
[22:25:55] <Frozenlock> Something something transducers windows
[22:26:28] <Frozenlock> https://github.com/cgrand/xforms
[22:26:35] <Frozenlock> Probably waaaaaaaay overkill
[22:26:54] <seebs> possibly i should look at zippers which are similar in shape anyway

[22:30:51] <seebs> hmm. only loop and fn are "recursion points"? i guess that makes sense.
[22:38:14] <Frozenlock> seebs: you could look at clojure.pprint/print-table and see if it does what you want.
[22:38:58] <Frozenlock> Derp, no, it doesn't have a last line option
[22:42:57] <seebs> huh. i thought of what i thought might be a solution, but it is not, because recur can only be called from tail position, which... i thought is what i was doing.

[22:44:55] <seebs> oh
[22:44:57] <seebs> ()
[22:47:36] <seebs> also that's quadratic
[22:51:40] <seebs> now i just need to do the same thing for hashes.
[22:51:59] <technomancy[m]> multimethods are hard to change the dispatch function for
[22:52:39] <technomancy[m]> outside dispatch changes they don't have any reload problems. not nearly as gnarly as protocols.
[23:01:16] <seebs> https://gist.github.com/seebs/d4339e42cd73d0bbdcce830103876b3e <-- it works!
[23:14:50] <seebs> https://github.com/seebs/nbtdb/blob/main/src/nbtdb/core.clj
[23:15:11] <seebs> so i'm interested in feedback. the specific thing where i'm doing a ton of stuff by hand that is probably handled by libraries is intentional, i'm trying to get my head around a new language.
[23:17:18] <seebs> one person told me they think it's "unlispy" to be doing prints in loops, rather than building the string and then printing it, and that may even be true, but also that feels like a very quadratic-cost solution.
