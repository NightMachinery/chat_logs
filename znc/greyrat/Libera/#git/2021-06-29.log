[01:32:33] <imMute> Arsen: I think most poeple go for SSH or HTTPS transports if they need security.
[01:34:23] <Arsen> imMute: yeah I presumed, figured I'd ask, since it's supposedly slightly faster, and I don't even wanna bother if it's not tls (unless I measure a good difference)

[01:39:09] <beshr> conr: not exactly, -X is used to pass an option to the merge strategy (this implies --merge, defaults to recursive). There are a couple of other options but "ours" and "theirs" can auto-resolve conflicts by favoring a either trees. They function kind of like "git checkout --theirs/--ours -- file", but reversed. Sorry to shoot you a docs link but you're probably better off with a temp repo to mess around with and trying each one of these
[01:39:09] <beshr> options https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase#_merge_strategies
[01:39:12] <jast> likely most of the overhead will be in TLS :)
[01:39:31] <jast> on top of what is strictly required to make the git protocol work with any transport
[01:40:45] <Arsen> jast: the question on my mind was whether https transport used multiple separate requests, as opposed to a single connection for the git:// one, if thats the case there would be actual benefit from pipelining or gits://
[01:41:06] <Arsen> but I just ran a dirty test by cloning qemu using both of those protocols to measure no difference (outside of the margin of error)
[01:41:24] <beshr> conr: another tip if you find yourself resolving the same conflicts over and over again, checkout git rerere (for reuse recorded resolution). Not sure about your situation, but it might ease the pain if you're working on a long lived branch.
[01:41:27] <jast> as I recall everything is handled in a single HTTP request
[01:41:37] <jast> if you're using smart HTTP, that is (and you should)
[01:41:48] <jast> there is one extra HTTP request for negotiation potentially

[06:16:22] <jim> you made iot
[06:17:06] <maher> jim: thanks!
[06:17:33] <jim> welcome... now, which repo is this?
[06:18:12] <maher> I'm looking at this: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/evince/-/merge_requests/316
[06:18:51] <maher> I haven't looked at this since Feb - so my local copy of master is from Feb
[06:19:30] <maher> if I do git pull in the master branch it asks if I want to merge or rebase - I think I want to reabse
[06:19:42] <jim> I see commits from yesterday

[06:20:30] <maher> if i do a rebase, and decide later I should have done a merge, can I undo the rebase?
[06:21:06] <jim> well, you could always reclone... are you contributing code to it
[06:21:07] <jim> ?
[06:21:55] <maher> I sent in a patch and revised it - I think I did it the git way with a request to merge - can you tell from that webpage if I am meant to to anything now?
[06:22:19] <jim> is 316 yours?
[06:22:26] <maher> yes
[06:22:50] <jim> brb
[06:23:14] <maher> but I don't understand anything about git and needed some hand holding to get there, and don't want to bug the evince devs further if I can avoid it...
[06:25:59] <jim> ok
[06:26:55] <maher> i just did a git fetch, and it downloaded some things, but git show still shows somethign with a Feb 26 date

[06:37:57] <maher> jim: I want to know the minimun about git to get this patch into the evince source tree so I don't need to maintain my own version which I have been doing for the past 10 years :(
[06:38:46] <jim> I guess the merge request is present...
[06:39:11] <maher> jim: ok - here's a specific question: maybe master points to some other branch which is not evnice master - how do I find out where master points to?
[06:39:13] <jim> howbout this: let's reclone the repo into a different dir... sound good?
[06:39:43] <maher> jim: in the past past I have always just made new clones - I thought I would try and do things the git way this time
[06:40:14] <jim> well we could look at a fresh clone to see what's what
[06:41:47] <jim> find a different dir you'd like to use (you could get rid of this clone when you figure out what happened)
[06:42:22] <jim> cd to that dir... and run git clone git@gitlab.gnome.org:GNOME/evince.git
[06:42:37] <maher> ok - I just made a new clone and git show gives me a Jun 27th change
[06:42:53] <jim> ok
[06:43:35] <maher> how do I find out where master comes from>
[06:43:45] <jim> then cd to the original clone (yeah, it's a contradiction :), and see if you can run: git merge
[06:44:26] <maher> i ran: git clone git@gitlab.gnome.org:GNOME/evince.git  <--- what do I type into git to tell me that that master comes from there?
[06:44:34] <rifl> i want commands combined together in push like this "git once" which consists of git add git commit git push , how can i do this?
[06:45:27] <maher> jim: on the original one it says up to date, so I think imMute was right, and that master is not evince master but something else
[06:46:02] <rifl> seems my script running this has old syntax is outof date
[06:46:02] <jim> that could be
[06:46:12] <maher> hah!: git remote show origin
[06:46:23] <jim> do you understand what a git fork is?
[06:47:01] <jim> you found it :)

[06:49:06] <jim> that's the book Pro Git by Scott Chacon
[06:49:12] <maher> jim: i thought I knew what a fork was in source code repositories, but my inability to use git shows that in fact I do not understand them
[06:50:39] <maher> ok - so the original rep I was looking at is:  Fetch URL: git@gitlab.gnome.org:josephmaher/evince.git
[06:50:50] <jim> when you ask a site like github (which is a storage place for repositories), to fork a particular repository, it takes the repo and makes a complete copy of it, including all the history
[06:51:05] <jim> and sets it up so that you can write to it
[06:51:07] <maher> actual evince master is: Fetch URL: git@gitlab.gnome.org:GNOME/evince.git
[06:52:07] <maher> jim: ok - I think I'm getting there - so I thought I was in evince master, but I was in the Feb 26th remote copy master...
[06:52:13] <jim> if you write or push to the repository, or even if you mess it up entirely, it won't hurt the original
[06:53:04] <jim> you can blow it all away, and it won't hurt the original
[06:53:22] <maher> jim: I don't want to mess up git@gitlab.gnome.org:josephmaher/evince.git because isn't that where the evince devs are going to pull the changes for the main tree if they ever decide to merge them?
[06:54:05] <jim> once the fork is ready, you would clone the fork... then you can work work work, commit commit, push push push...

[15:25:03] <stennowork> good day, i want to copy a repository A with all its branches and commit history into a new repository B. I selected the --mirror option during cloning. Now if i push a commit to repository A, will it reflect in B and vice versa?
[15:25:33] <ikke> stennowork: it will not automatically sync, you need to setup hooks to do that
[15:25:40] <stennowork> aah great
[15:25:54] <stennowork> can i still cherrypick from A to B ?
[15:26:30] <ikke> sure
[15:26:49] <ikke> note that if you clone with --mirror, B will be a bare repository
[15:27:02] <ikke> So that repo does not have a working tree
[15:27:30] <stennowork> what is the consequence of that? can i not push commits to B?
[15:27:55] <ikke> You cannot do operations which require a working tree (cherry-picking for example)
[15:28:13] <ikke> bare repository are actually what you want when you want to push to it
[15:28:56] <stennowork> so i cannot cherrypick _from_ B?
[15:29:03] <stennowork> sorry for being so slow lol
[15:29:24] <ikke> You can fetch history from B, and then cherry-pick locally, that's not an issue
[15:29:36] <ikke> You cannot cd to repository B and cherry-pick there
[15:29:36] <stennowork> i only want to pick from A to B
[15:29:55] <stennowork> hmm

[15:33:11] <ikke> stennowork: in general, you do not need to cherry-pick on B
[15:33:23] <ikke> you can have a dedicated branch on A, cherry-pick commits there, and then push that to B

[20:05:16] <mehwork> is it always bad to squash commits after pushing? For instance, even if it's my own branch?
[20:05:55] <BtbN> After pushing?
[20:05:57] <ikke> It all depends on expectations of others
[20:06:09] <BtbN> You'd immediately diverge from what you just pushed, and the next pull/push will be a mess.
[20:06:15] <ikke> If the branch you are working on is only used by yourself or not
[20:10:10] <Timvde> Using fixup commits and autosquash is explicitly part of our workflow
[20:11:02] <mehwork> I'm so confused

[20:43:37] <mehwork> j416: ok, and going forward am i better off using --squash when merging develop to my branch?
[20:43:43] <j416> mehwork: the reason altering the history of a shared branch is often a bad idea is that you can end up with people confused over why their history suddently doesn't match what's on the remote.
[20:43:44] <mehwork> e.g., git merge --squash develop

[20:45:45] <j416> it's a valid workflow; just creates a lot of unnecessary noise, which I prefer to not have.
[20:46:06] <j416> also risk of introducing issues in merge conflict resolution
[20:46:27] <j416> I prefer to rebase topic branches instead.
[20:47:21] <j416> this does of course still doesn't remove potential merge conflicts, but at least you get to solve them in the original commits, rather than doing that in the merge commit
[20:48:13] <j416> and through that, you get clean history, plus git blame or git bisect or such will give you a proper commit that introduced whatever bug, rather than a merge commit
[20:48:18] <j416> which is useful.
[20:49:25] <mehwork> j416: git-flow is merge based so yeah
[20:49:27] <j416> this is subjective. some prefer to keep the commit history exactly as it happened, with all work in progress half-finished commits and so. I see no value in that, but each to their own.
[20:50:02] <j416> mehwork: in that case, avoid --squash, because that won't create a merge.
[20:50:03] <mehwork> the _only_ reason i use git rebase is to keep history cleaner by getting rid of useless commits like "fixes eslint issue"
[20:50:18] <mehwork> ok thanks

[20:50:39] <mehwork> well, wait, that's what i wanted though
[20:50:56] <mehwork> to also keep the useless 'merged develop' commits that are just there to keep my branch up to date
[20:51:50] <j416> if you're keeping the commits anyway, why not keep the history of those commits by avoiding --squash?

[20:56:57] <j416> merge --squash effectively discards the history and just keeps the result of the merge, which becomes a regular commit with no info on where those changes came from other than the commit message

[20:58:05] <mehwork> ok, so you're saying don't use merge --squash because it offers no real benefit and only takes away the ability to figure out if a merge of that branch caused a bug?
[20:58:32] *** Joins: vicecea (~vicecea@109.201.152.169)
[20:58:55] <mehwork> and i shouldn't squash those merges of other branches into my branch, unless i've verified it didn't cause a bug first?
[20:59:47] <BtbN> I don't like having merge commits in my history at all
[20:59:53] <BtbN> hard to read and potentially confusing
[20:59:55] <vicecea> hi, I merged another branch that included 2 commits, C1 and C2, C2 added a file F1, however, F1 does not exist after I have merged the branch in the workspace, I can't `git co F1` and merging the branch again says it's already up to date - I have never seen this before, any pointers?
[21:00:16] <j416> mehwork: it won't take away the ability to figure out that the _merge_ cause the bug.
[21:00:38] <mehwork> ok, then i wish squash ad nauseum
[21:00:48] <j416> mehwork: but that's the very issue. If the merge commit caused the bug, that creates more headache than needed.
[21:01:18] <j416> mehwork: it's the equivalent of writing code, committing that saying "Add stuff"
[21:01:24] <j416> not very useful.
[21:01:57] <j416> except also in this case, you're doing that with code you didn't write.
[21:02:24] <mehwork> j416: meaning if 'git log' in my branch shows these 3 commits:  1. fixes eslint issue 2. Merge branch 'develop' into <mybranch>  3. Commit message i want  -- then i'll do `git rebase -i HEAD~3` and squash 2 and 3, right?
[21:02:26] <j416> but, y'know, squash merge if you prefer.
[21:02:38] <mehwork> yeah i'm not gonna use --squash
[21:02:40] <j416> mehwork: I don't understand the question
[21:02:41] <BtbN> My colleagues at work love squash merges
[21:02:55] <BtbN> so our history consists only of single commits with like -5000+5000 lines
[21:03:03] <BtbN> bisecting bugs is next to impossible
[21:03:04] <j416> BtbN: wonderful.
[21:03:28] <BtbN> Not sure if that or their original history of "Ooops" "Fix" "One more thing" "forgot" would be better
[21:03:29] <j416> small commits make finding bugs much easier.
[21:03:49] <j416> BtbN: sounds like you want to teach them a thing or two. :)
[21:03:51] <mehwork> j416: my question is, is it ok to do that based on everything we've talked about with keeping history a cleaner while still  merging develop into my branch
[21:03:56] <BtbN> I tried. Doesn't work.

[21:04:31] <mehwork> j416: once i push these changes and make a PR in github, i don't want it saying there's 3 commits. I want it saying there's 1
[21:04:36] <j416> mehwork: looks like you're describing squash merge.
[21:04:45] <j416> mehwork: so rebase.
[21:05:00] <mehwork> yes that's why i said i'm going to do git rebase -i HEAD~3 in that case
[21:05:01] <BtbN> You usually want one commit per "thing" you did
[21:05:04] <BtbN> as granular as possible
[21:05:19] <mehwork> j416: and then i'll mark 2 and 3 as 'squash'
[21:05:45] <j416> mehwork: skip the merge altogether
[21:05:47] <j416> mehwork: just rebase
[21:05:58] <BtbN> You don't want stuff like "typo fixes" as individual commits, unless the typo is in the main repo
[21:06:01] <j416> mehwork: also, rebase will eat the merge by default.
[21:06:15] <mehwork> j416: the problem for me is that i already have a PR and it's still showing 3 commits. And when i squash this one into 1 commit, it shows 4 commits now :/
[21:06:36] <j416> mehwork: rebase + force push is the only option to get that to show 1 commit.
[21:06:52] <mehwork> oh i didn't force push when i pushed, maybe that's why
[21:07:01] <BtbN> You pushed _something_ tho
[21:07:04] <j416> ^
[21:07:06] <mehwork> yes
[21:07:17] <mehwork> it still let me push
[21:07:22] <mehwork> without -f
[21:07:23] <j416> force push is only useful when you have altered history
[21:07:33] <mehwork> that's what i'm trying to do
[21:07:39] <j416> but you didn't.
[21:07:48] <mehwork> alter the history from 3 commits to 1 by rebasing
[21:07:50] <j416> if you had, the regular push would give an error.
[21:08:01] <j416> if you rebase, then a regular push won't work.
[21:08:28] <mehwork> but i did rebase, what the heck. I did git rebase -i HEAD~3 and squashed 2 commits
[21:08:43] <j416> mehwork: anyway, object model, commit graph. it's in the book. :)
