[00:23:27] <pyzozord> ok I decided I will beer after all. But not three 33cl beers, only two
[00:23:46] <ski> whether something is a side-effect is not an absolute thing. it doesn't matter if something is implemented, in a compiler, as modification of some memory location, on a low level. what matters is the level of the language itself, what reasoning (including refactoring) you can and can't rely on
[00:23:49] <pyzozord> which isn't a lot for me, considering there is a lot of me
[00:24:18] <apotheon> ski: In functional programming contexts IO is often regarded as a side effect because it changes state external to the function, which can alter program behavior.
[00:24:42] <apotheon> I don't know if there's some abstruse academic caveat that makes that usage wrong, but that's how I've seen it for decades.
[00:25:10] <nitrix> apotheon, It builds up a computation that's effectful, like some kind of blueprint and that can be done entirely in a pure manner. Then eventually that information bubbles up to the equivalent of main(), handed to the runtime, which can them perform the operations, leading to the effects getting carried out, yet the code remained completely pure.
[00:25:30] <apotheon> I guess that would explain why Haskell gets away with segregating IO with monads, though, and still calls itself "pure functional" programming.
[00:25:47] <ski> for the "hardware/CPU gets warmer", point is that programmers don't care about that, when they think of the intended behaviour of the program. stronger than that, they explicitly (usually) do *not* want to count those things, *because* they want to be able to use reasoning and refactoring that "keeps the behaviour" (the behaviour we intend / are interested in) *while* changing the "hardware/CPU gets 
[00:25:53] <ski> warmer" part (namely by using less time, using less space, using less resources in general)
[00:26:32] <Stefan26> yeah I was being a bit silly ski :) but good reasoning
[00:26:32] <apotheon> nitrix: Is the only point of that making sure that some kind of race condition around "effects" doesn't occur?
[00:27:18] <nitrix> apotheon, Consider me creating the list ["Fetch url google.com and store response in $a", "Print $a"]. I haven't done anything, my function only built a list using concatenation operators, boring strings. Given more strings and more things to concatenate, I could generate all sorts of things and they could all easily be tested in a reproducible manner without actually carrying out any operation.
[00:27:27] <apotheon> ski: I'm not talking about hardware functionality affected by thermodynamics.  I'm talking about things like writing to, and reading from, disk; altering files; changing state of a communicating process; et cetera.

[00:30:57] <ski> separate internal machinery from user (including OS) interfacing. you don't put random `printf's (or open alert windows) inside your datastructure machinery (unless it's for temporary debugging)
[00:31:02] <apotheon> I still don't see how the program's operation is not creating "side effects" if it produces output that can alter input given a repetition of the same input operations.  It is effectively changing its own inputs.

[00:34:46] <deniska> apotheon: in this case the lack of side-effects is enforced via a type system though
[00:34:52] <apotheon> It basically seems to boil down to "the program itself doesn't have to be functional; only its source code does"
[00:35:12] <ski> apotheon : are you talking about aliasing (by-reference) input and output parameters, so that when the program (or function) constructs output, that becomes part of the input (for the same invokation of the program / call of the function) ?

[00:35:29] <apotheon> ski: I'll just give you an example.
[00:35:34] <nitrix> apotheon, Well, it doesn't have to feed its output to its input, you can call everything external to the program "the world", and your input/outputs are against that "world". Also, in practice, the effects don't have to reach the output to be carried out, as long as the conceptual model isn't broken, the runtime can run them as soon as you've constructed them. It just has to appear pure from the programmer point of view.

[00:39:58] <nitrix> apotheon, I understand the confusion you have. You're essentially asking if the effects end up only happening at the "end" of the program, since the whole program cannot really do any IO or else it wouldn't be pure, correct?
[00:40:15] <apotheon> kinda
[00:40:30] <apotheon> yeah, maybe
[00:40:41] <ski> apotheon : monads are not used at run-time. they are a compile-time thing. assuming you meant "monadic action", i guess it depends on what you mean by "produce output". it surely can produce (local) output from a call it's making, which it then will consume (without any external visibility). it could also "produce output" in the sense of making that output parts of its own output (by which i mean its 
[00:40:47] <nitrix> And that obviously a program like that wouldn't be useful because some programs are interactive, they have to keep running.
[00:40:47] <ski> return value, which could be computed upon-demand by the caller, incrementally, e.g. if it's a stream, or a lazy tree)
[00:41:24] <apotheon> I actually write a lot of programs that are purely functional, in languages like C, Ruby, and shawk.
[00:41:57] <nitrix> apotheon, The trick is that the "purity" we speak of is a conceptual model. In practice, the implementation of the language is able to carry the operations as they're assembled, without without for them to make its way to the output.
[00:42:06] <nitrix> waiting*
[00:42:38] <deniska> apotheon: sure. In haskell the distinction between pure and non-pure functions is spelled out as a type, while in a language like C the best you can do is a promise in documentation
[00:42:39] <ski> apotheon : "Does that type change prohibit returning a value, thus making the function not a function?" -- no. it just makes it a function that returns an (I/O) action. so, all callers will have to be adapted (will also have to return actions, if they didn't already)
[00:43:00] <ski> it's internal machinery vs. I/O / user interface separation
[00:43:08] <nitrix> apotheon, "When" the operations are executed is kind of irrelevant, as long as they happen in the right order and that they results are still passed properly in the functions that expects to work with them.

[00:47:26] <ski> the simplistic model of an I/O action as a list of instructions is suggestive, but not sufficient. you also want to be able to embed in an I/O action a branching construct that branches depending on the value of an intermediately computed result (depending on earlier action execution), and you also want to be able to loop. building functions into actions (which is what the "bind" monadic operation does) 
[00:47:32] <ski> enables both of these, it enables a "back-and-forth" between the (conceptually stratified) levels of "execution" (of actions) and "evaluation" (of pure expressions, including calling functions)

[00:48:13] <apotheon> Okay . . . I'm getting closer to an understanding of this, but everything so far just seems to be turtles all the way down, and I don't have time to continue.  I'm supposed to be writing, and have limited time today.
[00:48:13] <deniska> apotheon: (a simplification, and I'm an amateur haskell programmer at best) So, in haskell you have `main` function which is an IO function. You can call IO and non-IO functions from it. From non-IO functions you can only call other non-IO functions

[00:48:55] <ski> (well, of course you could explicitly request (code) an I/O computation to cache a result. but then that's part of the behaviour you've specified)
[00:49:24] <apotheon> I'm generally happy to just take it as given that Haskell is "pure", given monads, but I'd prefer to really understand the theory.  I'm kind of a "systems thinker" that way; rote memorization and acceptance isn't my bag.
[00:49:29] <nitrix> deniska, The secret is that the IO functions aren't just calling other IO functions, they are IO computations combined into a larger IO computation.
[00:49:38] <ski> apotheon : *nod* .. it can be a little bit daunting, at first, to fathom how it could fit together, work out. ty for the discussion

[00:50:19] <deniska> nitrix: yes, but that's an implementation detail an amateur haskell programmer can ignore :)
[00:50:48] <ski> (also, the general conversation was not just about monads, or Haskell, but about declarative programming in more general, including logic programming, including using uniqueness to ensure purity/declarativity, while enabling update-in-place operations on arrays, or on the world (I/O), &c.)
[00:51:05] <deniska> I think it's healthier to just treat haskell as just a language with weird syntax for a while, instead of trying to understand what a monad is :)
[00:51:44] <ski> the point of monads is not as much that you have them, but that you know when you're *not* using them

[00:53:02] <ski> (although, being able to concoct up custom exotic monads, e.g. for parsing, or (angelic) nondetermism (/ search), or incremental/adaptive computation, or replay/rewind behaviour, &c. can be quite nifty at times)
[00:55:09] <pyzozord> deniska: that's a very practical way to learn languages in general. You don't learn about "correlative conjunctions" when you learn english, you just learn to use "either, or"
[00:55:20] <nitrix> deniska, I don't know. main = getLine >>= putStrLn reads to me like... actions[] main() { actions := [], actions += "Read a line and store into $tmp", actions += "Print $tmp with a newline" }, where what's in strings are more sophisticated like annonymous functions, but the idea is the same.
[00:55:34] <KillerWasp> not's I/O anymore, now is IO. ok.
[00:56:37] <nitrix> deniska, Main took actions and assembled them into a larger action. The actions interacts with the real world, but main was able to express this in a completely pure manner.
[00:56:54] <KillerWasp> i sometimes mix with ASM codes, like .s files, for work with IO.
[00:57:19] <ski> yea .. unfortunately beginners tend to obsess a bit too much about "what's a monad" (and most of the "monad tutorials" out there are bad, presumably most of them written by not-long-ago-beginners, who misunderstand what made monads "click" to them) .. it tends to be a concept that's possibly best appreciated with an examples-first approach (with a focus on the boiler-plate removal capabilities)

[00:57:43] <deniska> nitrix: or you can just use do-notation, and then it just looks like your average imperative language
[00:58:42] <nitrix> The syntax isn't the intimidating part. The problem is justifying why you want pure code and why an IO type.
[00:59:19] <pulse> how do ZIP files store/handle passwords?
[00:59:40] <Decker> with the wrong password the decrypt fails and CRC fails
[00:59:43] <Decker> it doesn't store it
[00:59:46] <nitrix> Because that's what leads to all the necessary abstractions created on top to implicitly hide that.
[00:59:47] <deniska> If you have some experience programming, you probably see value in not putting IO around willy nilly :)
[00:59:59] <ski> one can tell someone that monads are about (dynamic) sequencing, and that "sequencing" can mean, in different instances, "short-circuiting","loop nesting","registration of on-result-computed callbacks","version passing","log summaries","environment/config (with local modification) distribution",&c. .. but it's hard to grasp what this means, without at least some practical experience with these examples,

[01:40:38] <pyzozord> I put the biggest and most important thing first, even though usually it depends on the things below
[01:40:47] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: well you get me then
[01:41:09] <pyzozord> wasn't following the convo, sorry
[01:41:17] <ProfSimm> Ouch

[01:42:45] <pyzozord> for me it depends, when conversation gets more investing I focus on just chat, but otherwise I just hang around while doing my stuff

[01:43:45] <Inline> lol
[01:44:15] <pyzozord> ProfSimm: but to be more precise I do that only with the "that one main biggest most important thing in the file", rest of the things usually follow the C's top-down structure

[01:47:13] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: the mind is an entropy reversal engine. We think of a goal, and then we build a path to that goal step by step. How to put the pieces together. This is literally the inverse of how time works: there's a cause, then the pieces flying off from the place of "incident" being the cause. Goals are time-inversed causes
[01:47:58] <pyzozord> ProfSimm: that's a very interesting view

[01:49:18] <pyzozord> it's just a different way of thinking of the same thing
[01:49:23] <ProfSimm> tomathy: well yes. This is how we lower entropy. We see things around us, and we figure out how they fit together as a whole, and we do it. This is the inverse of what nature does. There's a whole, and it breaks apart in pieces that you can see would fit together if you traced things back
[01:49:44] <tomathy> ah i see
[01:50:02] <ProfSimm> We flip the arrow of time in our head, and then project this inverse timeline onto reality
[01:50:06] <tomathy> so you see goals as putting back together things, but i dont see how they cause anything in their past
[01:50:14] <ProfSimm> We're not used to thinking about it like that, but it is like that
[01:50:39] <ejjfunky> how does entropy work in software?

[01:51:37] <ProfSimm> tomathy: cause and effect is what in its basics? It's things that interact and become correlated after interaction. They become modified in some way that the interaction caused.

[01:55:06] <ProfSimm> Anyway point was that in code you want to specify the final goal and then trace it back to the "parts" you have.
[01:55:16] <ProfSimm> You want to read code like this as well no
[01:55:26] <ProfSimm> So we should have languages that support this
[01:56:06] <ProfSimm> When we plan we don't start with how many eggs we break in a bowl. We start with "I want to make a birthday cake"
[01:56:38] <ejjfunky> ProfSimm -> very hard to do. impossible even, imo. to think like this with software.
[01:57:07] <ProfSimm> Then "I need cream, I need layers, I need chocolate" Then you take that and expand it further, for cream "I need eggs, I need to whip the eggs" and so on
[01:57:13] <ProfSimm> It unfolds naturally
[01:57:21] <ProfSimm> Until you arrive only to things you already have. Like time and money

[01:59:53] <tomathy> ejjfunky: it's giving the life to some people too, but yeh companies like "meta" and twitter are like dementors
[02:00:09] <ProfSimm> tomathy: things that don't matter or exist too much, I don't know. People worry about sports and politics, or collecting stamps, we're programmers, isn't it worth worrying about interesting things, and something might pop out as a result to progress us
[02:00:36] <ejjfunky> especially when meta is in full force, it'll be more entropies

[02:13:20] <tomathy> sounded*
[02:13:35] <ejjfunky> ProfSimm, bipolar in what way?
[02:13:42] <ProfSimm> tomathy: nah it's fine, I'm interested in all this stuff. In fact, the idea of the average man that they can trust their mind is only an illusion. For all of us
[02:14:33] <tomathy> yeh the main os of the brain protects itself at all costs even at the expense of the conscious entitty
[02:14:48] <ProfSimm> ejjfunky: bipolar in clinical sense, manic/hypomanic episodes followed by mild or more severe depressive episodes. If the brain is very overloaded it can also result in transient psychotic conditions
[02:15:15] <ProfSimm> ejjfunky: if you're asking me about the definition or...
[02:15:36] <ejjfunky> not definition. your bipolar. 
[02:15:44] <ejjfunky> how are you bipolar?
[02:15:45] <tomathy> but it can also save you
[02:16:00] <tomathy> he aint i am
[02:16:08] <ejjfunky> oh ok.
[02:16:08] <ProfSimm> ejjfunky: well I've had periods where I look back and realize I've been overly excited and forced people into some pretty stupid shit
[02:16:16] <ejjfunky> how are you bipolar, tomathy?
[02:16:32] <tomathy> ejjfunky: by at times my dreams leaking into reality
[02:16:55] <ejjfunky> ProfSimm, if you put that way, I think we all have that bipolar.
[02:17:06] <ProfSimm> ejjfunky: it all starts like that.
[02:17:21] <ProfSimm> ejjfunky: labels are boolean, but that's not how the brain works
[02:17:22] <ejjfunky> maybe it's a technical tendency, one of them programmers.
[02:17:34] <ProfSimm> we're all bipolar just more or less. And so on
[02:17:59] <ejjfunky> tomathy, dreams into reality? now, that's ... interesting and weird.
[02:18:24] <tomathy> i mean it literally, where bizarre thoughts that make no sense take you over, im not talking about MLK dreams
[02:18:57] <ejjfunky> ProfSimm, I don't know about labels being boolean. The English dictionary has proven words to have multiple meaning. some even have extremely different meanings to each other.
[02:18:58] <tomathy> but it's baed on the ectasy of fear
[02:19:24] <ProfSimm> ejjfunky: well there's the dictionary but then there's how we habitually think,
[02:19:45] <ProfSimm> ejjfunky: we accept words as binary a lot of the time, even if thinking more about it makes us reconsider.
[02:20:23] <ejjfunky> ProfSimm, how about an example?
[02:20:44] <ejjfunky> tomathy, that's wacky.
[02:21:33] <ejjfunky> actually, before this, i just had a nice dream (from sleep). woke up still remembering the dream and i continue playing with the dream at my waking time.
[02:21:49] <ProfSimm> ejjfunky: let's say "murderer" what does that mean. Is a soldier a murderer. What about a doctor who made a mistake.
[02:22:07] <ProfSimm> ejjfunky: what if they made a mistake, but didn't care
[02:22:19] <ProfSimm> etc
[02:22:48] * ski recalls one time dreaming, while walking around (outside)
[02:22:58] <ejjfunky> well, i consider doctors not behaving professionally to be murders. especially if the patients died
[02:23:13] <ejjfunky> murderers*
[02:23:21] <ski> (or rather, i'd fall asleep, still walking (or maybe stopping, standing still), then wake up confusing dream imagery with the surrounding world. repeat)
[02:23:26] <ProfSimm> tomathy: I've had dreams where I feel I utterly understand some concept I've been banging my head on for a week. Then I wake up and see it slip through my fingers as it rapidly fades away. It's frustrating. But also maybe just an illusion
[02:23:50] <ejjfunky> soldier? yea, when they shoot, whatever the reason, they're murderers in my book.
[02:24:00] <ski> (i hadn't slept for 42 hours or something)
[02:24:02] <pyzozord> the dreamy side on my side was always extremly boring
[02:24:07] <pyzozord> never even had a lucid dream
[02:24:14] <pyzozord> and I rarely have dreams at all
[02:24:15] <ProfSimm> ejjfunky: well yes in your book. But when we describe them as heroes, this means murderers can be heroes
[02:24:22] <pyzozord> at least rarely remember them
[02:24:24] <ski> pyzozord : you probably just don't remember them
[02:24:39] <ejjfunky> lucid dream is really hard. i seldom had it
[02:25:12] <ski> (you could try setting an alarm a half hour or an hour earlier, with a notepad with pen beside the bed. as soon as you start to move your position, dreams seems to evaporate away quickly)
[02:25:25] <ProfSimm> Most of my lucid dreams involve me realizing I can do whatever I want, and then swiftly forgetting and falling back into non-lucid dreams.
[02:25:47] <ski> there are some exercises that you can do that, supposedly, highen the probability of you having a lucid dream. but it does seem like some people naturally have them more commonly, than others
[02:25:59] <pyzozord> the most likely I'll have a dream if I overate before sleep
[02:26:19] <ski> there have been engineers and scientists who've solved a problem in their dreams, though
[02:26:28] <ProfSimm> I wonder if it's good for the brain or bad to lucid dream. Most guides describe it as positive, but they're biased
[02:26:29] <pyzozord> that's pretty cool for sure
[02:26:44] <ejjfunky> i haven't have them anymore it seems, but i used to have the 'dejavu' dreams.
[02:26:47] <pyzozord> I tried making lucid dreams when I was a kid, but never managed
[02:26:51] <pyzozord> big shame
[02:26:59] <ski> (someone said they were able to, in a lucid dream, to conjure up in front of them a complicated design, look at it from different angles, identify problems, &c.)
[02:27:05] <ejjfunky> they're dreams of being in a place you've never been before in the future
[02:27:19] <ejjfunky> and when they happened, you recalled that you've dreamed it
[02:27:23] <pyzozord> if I could lucid dream I'd do it all the time
[02:27:46] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: eat all you want, zero calories, sex with anyone, no STDs :P
[02:27:50] <pyzozord> and I'd probably be creating world and doing some engineering too
[02:27:57] <ejjfunky> imagine a country that you've never been before, a place you never seen ever. and you dreamed it.
[02:28:11] <pyzozord> oh yeah these too, but to a lesser degree I think
[02:28:15] <ski> ejjfunky : my brother claim's to've had such dreams
[02:28:18] <ejjfunky> and then when the moment came, you think to yourself, i've been here before.
[02:28:18] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: also as I'm writing this I realize how said my first thoughts are about satisfying basic instincts. And not, say merge quantum mechanics and relativity

[02:29:44] <ejjfunky> and the thing is, there were at least two dreams that i can recall now that i was not as i am. I was a bird, flying through an aerial view of the location.
[02:29:54] <ski> another brother of mine has said that he got happy, when he got a nightmare, since he recognized the sluggish feeling, and realized he was dreaming, becoming lucid, so he'd just exit the dream script, and go do something more interesting, like flying (perhaps through houses, &c.), exploring, talking to dream people, trying to convince them they're a part of a dream, &c.

[04:26:16] <Decker> it's not neeed everywhere either

[05:43:42] <ski> well, a call to the function needs to be able to indicate, to its caller whether (a) search failed (for this subtree), it's been searched exhaustively; or else (b) search succeeded (and you return a pointer to the node)

[05:44:49] <ski> so, when you call recursively, for the children of a node, you need to check after each such call whether you get `NULL'. in that case, you need to abort the loop for the children, and immediately return `NULL' to your caller

[06:16:37] <ski> now, you don't want to ignore the result `int' from the recursive call to `fetchItem'
[06:16:44] <ski> what do you want to do with that `int' ?

[06:18:42] <ski> (would you like me to try to hint more at it ?)
[06:18:49] <senoraraton> Nothing, you don't need it, because your test tests the current head, which at somepoint ALL nodes will be, and checks the key, the only reason for the recurssive call is to test all the child nodes.
[06:19:22] <senoraraton> You don't care what the value returns, because the only return statement that is valuable is the one in the head of the function.
[06:19:35] <ski> yes, but if you don't listen to the result of the recursive call, you'll not notice when it (possibly) tells you that that it's found the key in its subtree
[06:19:52] <ski> so, unfortunately, no, that answer isn't good enough
[06:19:58] <senoraraton> You do though, because again every node gets its data tested against the key in the head of the function call.
[06:20:21] <ski> (incidentally, this means that that `return' at the top is *not* good enough .. so you will, somewhere, need a new `return')
[06:20:46] <senoraraton> Your logic makes zero sense.
[06:21:05] <senoraraton> You said "Take the test against the data out of the loop" and now your saying that the test MUST be in the loop.
[06:21:41] <ski> i'm saying *something* more needs to be in the loop
[06:21:49] <ski> (and yes, that something will turn out to also be a test)
[06:22:30] <senoraraton> checking for equality to `key' should be outside the loop, not inside. comparing with `data' in current node, not in children nodes. children nodes will be taken care of by recursive calls, you just need to trust in the recursion doing what it's supposed to. if you then do what you're supposed to
[06:22:42] <ski> imagine you're climbing around in the tree
[06:22:53] <ski> and you're sitting at one node of the tree, the current node
[06:23:06] <ski> either the key you're looking at is at this exact node
[06:23:14] <senoraraton> Or its not, and I parse the children.

[06:23:37] <senoraraton> So then I make the call to the children, and for each child node I test its data against my key.
[06:23:46] <senoraraton> Thats what that code does, does it not?
[06:23:56] <ski> or, it's nowhere in the current subtree (then maybe it's in some sibling subtree of an ancestor .. or maybe it's nowhere. you don't care, either way, as it's not in *your* subtree)
[06:24:18] <senoraraton> So then if that were the case, there is already a set of recurssive calls for the other subtrees, because I started at the root.
[06:24:29] <senoraraton> And the function will just go back up to that spot in the recursion, and resume.
[06:25:05] <ski> "So then I make the call to the children, and for each child node I test its data against my key." -- almost. *you* don't test the data of the children. the recursive call does that. that's not *your* responsibility. your responsibility is (a) to check the current node; and (b) to communicate any findings of interest, from your children trees, to *your* caller

[06:26:43] <ski> if the key is in one of the children nodes, then the recursive call will (assuming everything goes to plan) return that key/data .. but you're not listening to it, so you wouldn't know if it found the key !
[06:27:01] <senoraraton> Why do I need to listen to it, when I test the nodes in the loop?
[06:27:14] <ski> it's not enough to make the recursive call (finding the key), you also need to check if the key has been found
[06:27:23] <senoraraton> That happens.  In the if statement.
[06:27:27] <ski> no

[06:29:00] <ski> you need to communicate information ("key found") *all* the way from the current call, many recursive calls up the call chain, up to the original call (for the root of the tree)

[06:32:09] <senoraraton> Why is that necessary. it just complicates the search.
[06:32:41] <senoraraton> It now means instead of the person who finds the item saying "I found the item" you have to go tell your boss you found the item, and now he tells everyone he found the item. It seems terribly inefficent.
[06:33:08] <senoraraton> Who cares who found the item, once the item is found, that node should announce it found the item.
[06:33:13] <ski> now, suppose that someone in the hieararchy does find what you're all looking for (maybe it's maps or plans or something). that person needs to communicate to their direct commander. but that commander will *also* need to communicate to *their* direct commander, up the chain, and so on, up til the top

[06:39:58] <ski> you perhaps know that, at some point, people were arguing that, instead of using a `break' (or `return') to abort a loop, you "ought" to set a boolean flag (or have some other way to indicate you should not continue), and then check that, in each iteration of the loop
[06:40:22] <senoraraton> We dpm
[06:40:35] <senoraraton> We don't want those to happen though. Once we find our key, all of those calls are dead weight

[06:40:48] <ski> of course, many people would argue : why check whether to continue or break in the loop, then set a flag, then check it again, at the condition for whether to continue the loop ? why not simply `break' the loop when you want to ?

[07:09:50] <ski> hm, i guess another avenue might be that `x = .75*(x+y)' is `x = .75*(2*x-(x-y))' .. and now you could try moving one `x' to the other side, while plugging in the other equation for `x-y'

[09:21:06] <apotheon> . . . because it was the polar opposite of what I described, usually.
[09:22:08] <zvijezda> I disagree with a lot of that. There is quite a bit to be taught in say a masters of education around pedagogical theory. Additionally, my wife's experiences is that a majority of time is spent asking students to put away their damned phones.

[09:28:29] <ejjfunky> problem with teaching students is that everyone has different ways of learning. you favor one, the other is losing out. you find the right balance, everyone is losing out.

[09:31:47] <zvijezda> apotheon, what is truly scary is that schools are actually giving up on teaching or even hiring teachers in general and moving to a model wherein they use pre-fab online schooling templates that are simply administered

[09:32:20] <zvijezda> apotheon, two years ago, the school districts stopped bothering taking on student teachers to train
[09:32:36] <ski> that's okay
[09:32:40] <zvijezda> apotheon, it left her entire class in a super weird situation because in person training is required to get actual certifications
[09:32:45] <apotheon> . . . if the people writing such systems even notice enough to use them in testing.
[09:32:48] <zvijezda> apotheon, this is actually happening somewhat nationwide
[09:33:37] <zvijezda> apotheon, the result has been to weaken certification standards -- I fear the existing system is close to collapse and they'll let corporations take over en masse soon

[09:33:45] <ejjfunky> actually, China has the right direction but most probably wrong implementation where you use AI attached to a camera on the students and identify kids who aren't learning (paying attention, bored, etc)
[09:34:01] <ejjfunky> of course, unlike china, we should bestow capital punishments on those kids

[09:54:23] <apotheon> Given a world with shit-tons of good information floating around on the internet (and, yeah, some shit information too), if you can *motivate* a student of serviceable intelligence you'll have a hard time *stopping* the student from learning.

[20:08:52] <EdFletcher> ejjfunky: you should be using a salt but most good APIs can do so automatically, and you definitely need to be using a hash function specifically designed for password hashing: the most popular but older is `bcrypt`, the new hotness is `argon2` -- https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html

[21:02:27] <ishanjain> I have some posts on a discourse forum. I want people to be able to access those posts offline via an android app. What may be the easiest way to do this ? Stuff like PWA is far too advanced for non technical users and the fact that they still have to navigate the forum to get the content doesn't help.

[21:18:52] <absentia> i am just here to eat popcorn
[21:19:04] <ishanjain> nomagno, Discourse generates rss feeds automatically. I have it already. I proposed that we can ask people to install a off the shelf rss reader and add the link in that app but that's too advanced. 
[21:19:38] <absentia> juliaEnv: there are a lot of ways to approach software requirements gathering and design
[21:19:48] <absentia> you could probably fill a small library with the material written on that

[23:12:06] <absentia> what's the difference between a list, a tuple, and a sequence
[23:12:07] <GeDaMo> All collections can basically be seen as nested key:value types
[23:12:38] <ski> ProfSimm : because, most of the time, the different arguments to functions are (a) fixed in number (b) have very different roles (often of different types)
[23:12:40] <GeDaMo> There are different restrictions on the types and ranges for keys and values
[23:12:42] <ProfSimm> absentia: the trivial different is a list is homogenous, a tuple is heterogenous but fixed length, sequence is least specific

[23:13:20] <ProfSimm> absentia: I was trying to describe sequences
[23:13:21] <absentia> does that mean all your function args must be the same type?
[23:13:40] <ski> absentia : a list/sequence is arbitrary-length and (usually) homogenous (elements are "treated in the same way"). tuples are fixed-length, and heterogenous
[23:13:42] <absentia> does not compute: internal consistency error
[23:13:42] <ProfSimm> No, this is something ski insists on because I suppose they're more in a C mindset.
[23:13:46] <absentia> ski: it was a socratic question

[23:20:44] <bayaz> Title: Arduino - Button - Debounce | Arduino Tutorial 
[23:20:56] <ProfSimm> ski: I told you earlier LISP has heterogenous lists, you said let's not talk about LISP
[23:21:01] <ski> Lisps has pairs. you can build different things out of those pairs (and other basic datums)
[23:21:15] <ProfSimm> ski: it has pairs, that build linked lists
[23:21:36] <Mortician> oh right the state
[23:21:42] <Mortician> i am using a timer
[23:21:55] <ProfSimm> It's in LISP's name that they think of it as lists :P
[23:21:57] <ski> ProfSimm : sure. when programming in a Lisp, i'd still not call that a list, if i'm using it as a tuple
[23:22:14] <ski> of course, it's *represented* as a Lisp list .. but that's immaterial
[23:22:21] <ski> i could've used a vector or a record instead
[23:22:52] <ProfSimm> ski: this is why Clojure calls it "seq" to avoid discussion on what it is. Seq is just an iterator interface.
[23:23:00] <ProfSimm> And that's all seq is. A stream of things.
[23:23:04] <absentia> ski is getting at the distinction between abstract data types and data structures
[23:23:15] <absentia> i can represent the dictionary abstract data type as an association list or a hashmap
[23:23:23] <absentia> with different performance characteristics for random access, insertion, deletion, etc
[23:23:29] <ski> yea, but that's not really much more helpful (except getting some polymorphism, being able to use different representations of sequences)
[23:24:02] <ski> i still wouldn't refer to it as a `seq', if i'm using it as a tuple
[23:24:15] <ski> i don't iterate over a tuple
[23:24:30] <ProfSimm> ski: it's helpful in that if everything is seq, including function arguments then you can build on that as a foundation. I.e. "tuple [1, 2, 3]" is not syntax for a tuple, it's a syntax for function "tuple" that takes a sequence of three items and returns a tuple of those 3 items

[23:24:47] <absentia> brb pissing into a wind tunnel
[23:25:01] <ski> ProfSimm : it's "helpful" in the same way that it's "helpful" in math to say that everything is a set .. iow, not at all helpful
[23:25:20] <ProfSimm> ski: it's helpful if you want to find consistency
[23:25:22] <ski> insisting on minimal foundations is not helpful, when you want to think conceptually about things
[23:26:07] <ProfSimm> ski: in my particular case it's helpful also because syntax is secondary to me, I don't want different types of nodes for similar things, or one type of node to mean completely different things depending on context
[23:26:07] <ski> except sequences and tuples are very different, so if you're attempting to find consistency between them, you're bound for some confusion
[23:26:19] <ProfSimm> nodes in the AST I mean
[23:26:36] <ProfSimm> ski: yes they're different, hence the constructor
[23:26:49] * ski . o O ( "Meaningful distinctions deserve to be preserved." -- Errett Bishop )
[23:26:52] <ProfSimm> The role of the constructor is to take one and map to another.
[23:27:28] <ski> "it's a syntax for function \"tuple\" that takes a sequence of three items and returns a tuple of those 3 items" -- yea, i'd definitely prefer to be spared that confusion
[23:27:54] <ProfSimm> ski: if you find it confusing you can think of "tuple [1, 2, 3]" as the literal syntax for a tuple.
[23:28:00] <ProfSimm> ski:  but that's not what's happening in the AST
[23:28:14] <ski> why make things more confusing than they have to be ?
[23:28:16] <jjido> ProfSimm writing a compiler?
[23:28:28] <ProfSimm> ski: how is it confusing to reduce concepts
[23:28:39] <ski> <ski> insisting on minimal foundations is not helpful, when you want to think conceptually about things
[23:29:00] <ProfSimm> ski: I think that's the uphill battle here, simplifying things means replacing complexity that's incidental, but at this point habitual, with something else. So people will fight it to defend it
[23:29:02] <ski> if you were reducing things in a conceptually sensible way, that would be fine
[23:29:05] <jjido> I like simple foundation.
[23:29:13] <ski> but pretending tuples are sequences is not that

[23:29:48] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> how do I get data outside of this
[23:29:48] <ski> you're passing a sequence of things to `tuple', and having it construct a tuple of those things

[23:30:35] <absentia> jjido: what about infinite sequences :)
[23:30:41] <ProfSimm> ski: the problem is when you strike it out, you need now another primitive for lists, maps, sets, code lines, etc etc.

[23:46:40] <bayaz> Title: jQuery.get() | jQuery API Documentation 
[23:46:57] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> I parse it back to object
[23:47:03] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> I just can't get to

[23:47:16] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> outside the $.get(){}
[23:47:20] <GeDaMo> tuple [1,2,3,4] is just a different (source) way of writing (1,2,3,4)
[23:47:20] <ProfSimm> ski: when you run this serialization in the runtime, you get a real tuple

[23:49:06] <ski> ProfSimm : "is it because of inefficiency or?" -- no, i'm talking about conceptual clarity (vs. confusion). but that will trickle down to confusion in the program, often bugs or irregularities (commonly leading to bugs), (sometimes) repetition of work, and sometimes inefficiency (because different things, which could possibly have been gainfully implemented differently, have been conflated)

[23:50:04] <ProfSimm> ski: I'm 100% open to the idea you're spelling out the issue for me I'm just dumb, I mean i am. But I just don't see you listing concrete issues I can point to and say "ah, here's a specific problem'
[23:50:25] <ski> ProfSimm : in `fopen(text)', the elements of `text' (some kind of characters) are not the elements of what's returned from the call to `fopen'. for your `tuple', it would be the other way
[23:50:40] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'position')
[23:50:43] <ProfSimm> ski: why does that matter.

[23:51:13] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> help me atleast once
[23:51:15] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> a month
[23:51:51] <ProfSimm> Ronalds_Mazitis_: do you know how to debug in JS with "debugger;"
[23:51:54] *** Joins: zaher_ (~zaher@188.160.231.97)
[23:52:04] <ski> ProfSimm : it means that, as far as what we're talking about, the input to `fopen' is unrelated to the output (only connected via the file system). so, i have no quarry with mishandling of input-output connection, since, in this sense, there was none to begin with. but that's not what you're suggesting for `tuple'
[23:52:13] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> dude like I don't see other options
[23:52:16] *** Quits: savolla (~quassel@88.227.92.215) (Quit: https://quassel-irc.org - Chat comfortably. Anywhere.)
[23:52:41] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> ether                            this.man.position.set(objl.x, objl.y, objl.z)
[23:52:56] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> is outside the loop and  .x can't be read
[23:53:03] <ski> ProfSimm : if you can't replace `tuple [1,2,3,4]' with `tuple mySeq', then that's somewhat better, i guess
[23:53:05] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> or it's inside and position can't be read
[23:54:17] <ProfSimm> Ronalds_Mazitis_: when you debug, the object is set correctly yes?
[23:54:49] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> the object is correct
[23:54:55] <ski> ProfSimm : one concrete issue is that it tends to promote the idea to programmers that tuples are just another kind of sequence/collection
[23:55:05] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> I hate scopes
[23:55:05] *** Quits: quartz (~quartz@user/quartz) (Quit: WeeChat 3.4)
[23:55:08] <ProfSimm> ski: I find it so odd you want to reduce capability like "tuple myseq" but I see no reason why

[23:55:13] <ski> i prefer programming in languages that don't make that conceptual mistake

[23:55:59] <ski> on the core of it, yes. but it will leak into how people program, and think about programs, and write their libraries (especially how the interfaces to them work)
[23:55:59] *** Quits: widp (~user@124.123.107.54) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:56:19] <ProfSimm> ski: what is wrong about converting a sequence to a tuple.

[23:56:27] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> cmmon
[23:56:30] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> any ideas
[23:56:32] <ProfSimm> ski: I maintain type info at runtime
[23:56:55] <ski> it's very rarely a sensible thing to want to do
[23:56:57] <ProfSimm> Ronalds_Mazitis_: did you debug and what did the debugger show. You can't just paste this over and over and expect different results
[23:57:04] *** Quits: kilitary (~kilitary@188.242.105.134) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:57:15] <ski> one reason to want to do it, may be because the language is braindead in one or another way
[23:57:29] <ski> another (valid) reason is because you're doing some kind of meta-programming
[23:57:38] <ProfSimm> ski: maybe it's rarely sensible, but if you think about it, I'm trying to make a language suitable for eDSLs, so I want to keep the AST as close to a "bunch of tokens" as I can.

[23:57:52] <ProfSimm> ski: hence why everything is sequences. I mean in a way it's literally just tokens
[23:58:00] <ProfSimm> ski: except slightly higher level
[23:58:14] <ski> in the end, it's all "just" quantum fields or something

[23:58:25] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> I hate scopes so much
[23:58:34] <ProfSimm> Ronalds_Mazitis_: clearly that object wasn't set.
[23:58:46] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> this {x: -0.9999999999999993, y: 0, z: 3.4228543333014734e-8}
[23:58:46] <ski> but that doesn't really matters that much. the levels of abstraction do matter. we have hierarchies of abstraction for a reason
[23:58:53] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> ProfSimm
[23:59:04] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> cleaarly I can't get normal help
[23:59:09] <ProfSimm> Ronalds_Mazitis_: is this your plan, to spam the same link in a loop. Without answering the questions we ask
[23:59:11] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> like write this code, or set it like this
[23:59:20] <absentia> ask github copilot
[23:59:22] <absentia> this is the future
[23:59:25] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> I did show how object is set
[23:59:26] <ProfSimm> Good plan I guess /s
[23:59:38] <ProfSimm> Ronalds_Mazitis_: did you step debug that code
[23:59:44] <ProfSimm> Ronalds_Mazitis_: do you know how to
[23:59:47] <ski> ProfSimm : hm, if i were wanting to make things very DSL suitable, i would prefer *not* to keep it as close to tokens as possible. rather do something Lispy or something
[23:59:51] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> I have no idea why CAN'T YALL HELP
