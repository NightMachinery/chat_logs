[02:02:28] <Joanna> joe7057: I’m not sure of the exact details about the guy who realized he was being exploited. Maybe at the beginning he just wanted to make something to be proud of and didn’t realize it would be so widely used by people making a profit off his free labor. I don’t know if there is a type of license that make for profit companies pay.
[02:07:21] <Joanna> JimBuntu: I thought that a large portion of the military was about to quit over unwanted experimental shots. In any case very few Americans are in the military and from what I know the military has a hard time getting enough doctors and nurses for its own use. I’ve heard that medical in military don’t even have to go through officer training course or anything like that even though they are commissioned officers. Also I don’t

[02:09:24] <Joanna> I think is safe to say it’s advisable to come up with a plan for providing your own medical care or making sure you don’t need any.
[02:12:20] <Joanna> I think the smartest thing for the guy with free software to have done was switch to a paid model for updates.

[18:22:59] <Joanna> Hi  sn1tch3r what’s new ?
[18:23:39] <Joanna> Atque: I’m not very familiar with that language:)
[18:24:07] <B4ckBOne> Python is very slow when it comes to performance compared to c c++ and the likes
[18:24:52] <Joanna> Java is slow...
[18:27:55] <fnk> not necessarily true
[18:28:30] <Joanna> There are many aspects to programming and I believe that people probably programmed better stuff back when resources were more scarce
[18:29:03] <Joanna> fnk: it’s been a long time since I ran a java program maybe it has improved
[18:29:43] <fnk> Java is usually more memory-consuming and sometimes java programs take more time to warm up
[18:29:54] <fnk> also it depends on what you are comparing
[18:30:06] *** Joins: s1gyn (~s1gyn@user/s1gyn)
[18:30:08] <fnk> full-fledged java software vs some 50 lines of python script
[18:30:45] <Joanna> Wasn’t the automatic memory management the main thing for Java? And running on different platforms
[18:30:48] <B4ckBOne> do you count the depenencies too?
[18:31:44] <fnk> Joanna: It does run on different platforms and yes, it has some features helping with memory management
[18:31:55] <fnk> all I'm saying is that Java is not necessarily slower than Python
[18:32:44] <B4ckBOne> But which of them is more operationally secure?
[18:33:21] * B4ckBOne coughs haskell
[18:33:53] <fnk> if i had to choose between python and java, i'd say java
[18:34:26] <fnk> personally I find a good balance of my requirements in Golang
[18:34:27] <B4ckBOne> i agree
[18:36:27] <Joanna> Too many languages to keep up with I’d be happy to be an expert in just one language:)
[18:36:55] <ilikeyou> i have enough trouble with English
[18:36:59] <fnk> :D
[18:37:14] <fnk> Joanna: it's not only about the language itself, it's also the ecosystem built around it
[18:37:42] <fnk> and it's about what you are focusing on
[18:37:48] <Joanna> If you write things down in English first it helps convert that into code I’ve found
[18:38:23] <B4ckBOne> Like a flowchart?
[18:38:55] <Joanna> For people who program professionally they use whatever language they are told to like it or not.
[18:39:03] *** Quits: dez (uid92154@user/dez) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[18:39:10] <Joanna> I’ve never used flow charts much
[18:39:27] <fnk> For example, if you want to create a mobile app, you wouldn't use e.g. PHP for that. There are tools that could make a mobile app out of PHP code, but I wouldn't say it's a good idea
[18:39:53] <Joanna> I sometimes write a story about what I want program be doing
[18:41:50] <Joanna> I like to craft things and programming is a lot like crafting
[18:42:23] <Joanna> It’s an artform
[18:43:18] <fnk> Joanna: there's approach called BDD - Behavior-driven development
[18:43:27] <fnk> I believe that it's close to what you are talking about
[18:43:32] <Joanna> No matter how much I plan though it’s a lot more complicated and full of features
[18:43:43] <Joanna> Oh ?
[18:44:12] <Joanna> I’m always thinking of new features I want
[18:44:41] <Joanna> Afk for awhile nice chatting
[18:45:30] <Joanna> See you later
[18:50:24] <B4ckBOne> Read you later Joanna :)
[18:56:14] <Atque> fnk: It's not really a good idea to make a web application from PHP anymore.
[19:00:12] <jan6> better than nodejs anyway ;P
[19:01:47] <jan6> fnk: it depends what your priorities and needs are, if your app is basically just enhanced version of your website, you could totally do it in php, with local caching, if your main site uses php already
[19:02:50] <jan6> php isn't bad, it just has the same problem as perl does, it makes it easy to write bad and/or unreadable code, even if it isn't bad itself
[19:02:51] <fnk> jan6: I was talking about transpilers
[19:03:04] <fnk> not about the webview
[19:03:12] <jan6> transpilers are a totally different thing, sure
[19:03:20] <jan6> you didn't mention anything that indicated that, tho ;P
[19:04:08] <fnk> and yeah, I don't think that PHP is definitely bad
[19:04:44] <fnk> I profesionally developed in PHP for 5 years
[19:04:53] <jan6> php just goes "we need to decide how to do X feature...f*k it, let's just implement ALL the ways to do it"
[19:04:54] <jan6> lol
[19:05:14] <fnk> and yeah, i've seen a lot
[19:05:16] <fnk> :D
[19:05:56] <fnk> and it has the problem I've mentioned earlier - it's not only the language, it's the ecosystem (and community) around it
[19:06:58] <jan6> I personally quite like Haxe, which transpiles and compiles into other languages, so it can output the "target" code as java, C++, python, lua, javascript, a few custom languages (neko, hashlink), php, and a few more, iirc
[19:07:29] <fnk> I've heard about it, but never used it
[19:07:38] <jan6> although it's very small community of mostly people transitioning to it in order to make games similarly to how they did with Flash
[19:12:17] <jan6> haxe is the only "reasonably good" programming language I've found, ever, Go's also good, but it's not that small, V is decent, but experimental and changing a bit, and Nim has so awful error messages that I can't handle it just because of that, otherwise isn't too bad either
[19:14:58] <jan6> C's problem is all the pointers and whatnot, you have to keep track of where you need to use plain variable, or pointer to the variable, or address of the variable, etc... well, manual memory management a tiny bit, but not so much, you could always just use a memory management library, and think through the possibilities when setting the various sizes to not have under/overflow
