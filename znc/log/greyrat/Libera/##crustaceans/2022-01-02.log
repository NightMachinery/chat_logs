[00:00:40] <manicennui> Are you promising perpetual energy?
[00:01:42] <imode> we already have powerless sensors.
[00:02:03] <imode> barometers, thermometers, etc.
[00:02:12] <imode> converting that to digital is another story.
[00:02:23] <manicennui> And getting the data somewhere.
[00:02:35] <manicennui> But mouseghost wasn't very specific about what this sensor would do exactly.
[00:03:05] <mouseghost> manicennui, basically you would buy a base station, that you need to power, and it would get data from all your sensors in vicinity
[00:03:22] <mouseghost> so you can collect it automatically et al
[00:03:33] <mouseghost> and im not promising perpetual energy or any of that
[00:03:53] <manicennui> Define "vicinity".
[00:04:05] <mouseghost> 1km radius?
[00:04:18] <companion_cube> how does it supply energy to the sensors?
[00:04:34] <mouseghost> sensors get it from the environment
[00:05:48] <mouseghost> i dont want to spoil everything :P
[00:05:52] <mouseghost> im just asking if you would buy it
[00:06:03] <manicennui> No.
[00:06:09] <manicennui> But I'm sure some suckers on Kickstarter would.
[00:06:34] <mouseghost> why suckers ;v
[00:16:54] <imode> because there's no "energy from the environment" that you can exploit unless it's via RF.
[00:17:05] <imode> and even then the power required isn't enough.
[00:18:42] <Brekkjern> Well... You have sun though
[00:18:49] <Brekkjern> But then you'd get bad temp readings
[00:19:37] <manicennui> It seems like this is actually an active area of research, and there are some working sensors.
[00:20:11] <manicennui> But I somehow doubt that some random teen on IRC is going to replicate this work.
[00:20:18] * imode shrugs.
[00:20:20] <imode> never doubt someone's drive.
[00:22:54] <manicennui> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanogenerator
[00:22:54] <buttsbot> Nanogenerator - Wikipedia
[00:23:38] <imode> mouseghost: if you want money, get a job or make a job. if you wanna do research/build stuff, build stuff. don't conflate the two.
[00:24:09] <mouseghost> make a job?
[00:24:22] <imode> yeah.
[00:24:50] <mouseghost> what do you mean by that?
[00:25:30] <imode> make and sell things, become a contractor, found a company.
[00:26:12] <imode> stuff where you're pretty directly in charge of generating income.
[00:26:20] <manicennui> Start an onlyfans.
[00:30:29] <mouseghost> imode, thats what i want to do! make and sell things!
[00:30:33] <mouseghost> just that this thing is novel
[00:30:42] <mouseghost> there was already research in that area. theres a bunch of papers
[00:31:11] * imode shrugs.
[00:31:36] <imode> commercializing a product from research that isn't finished yet is a good way to become depressed and financially upset.
[00:39:25] <mouseghost> :|
[00:39:27] <mouseghost> then what do
[00:39:32] <mouseghost> should i make wordpress sites or what, imode
[00:41:44] <drakonis> https://world.hey.com/dhh/i-won-t-let-you-pay-me-for-my-open-source-d7cf4568 jfc
[00:41:44] <buttsbot> I won't let you pay me for my open source
[00:41:48] <drakonis> shut up dhh
[00:47:14] <companion_cube> :D
[00:54:41] <imode> mouseghost: see someone that needs something? do it for them for a fee.
[00:54:50] <imode> you can also.. get a job.
[00:54:56] <mouseghost> > do it for them for a fee.
[00:54:57] <mouseghost> well
[00:55:03] <mouseghost> i wish i had more people that needed something :(
[00:55:09] <mouseghost> >you can also.. get a job.
[00:55:14] <mouseghost> i will when i have more time ;v
[00:55:27] <imode> what's draining your time?
[00:55:49] <mouseghost> tho i am already going aggro mode at hr people telling me that only prof. exp. years count, of which i have none... but it does not forbid them to forward senior offers to me
[00:55:52] <mouseghost> school, imode
[00:56:08] <imode> I mean.
[00:56:12] <imode> professional experience does count.
[00:56:21] <mouseghost> :C
[00:56:22] <imode> far more so than hobbyist stuff.
[00:56:27] <mouseghost> i have some freelancing experience
[00:56:32] <imode> how much.
[00:56:38] <mouseghost> half a year?
[00:56:45] <imode> good for a junior position.
[00:56:53] <mouseghost> bruh the requirements..
[00:57:03] <imode> what are they.
[00:57:08] <mouseghost> i mean
[00:57:21] <mouseghost> why junior
[00:57:24] <mouseghost> what does it even say
[00:57:32] <imode> because you don't have experience working for a company yet.
[00:57:52] <mouseghost> thats true
[00:58:01] <imode> that is the point of a junior role.
[00:58:05] <mouseghost> but that has nothing to do with the ability to solve things uh
[00:58:08] <imode> foot in the door, opportunity to grow.
[00:58:36] <imode> it absolutely has to do with that. you do not know how to program in the context of business.
[00:58:44] <mouseghost> why is the pay dependent on the amount of experience you have when you work for a corp., and not the ability to solve issues?
[00:58:54] <imode> the two are correlated.
[00:58:59] <imode> pretty heavily.
[00:59:00] <mouseghost> whats so vastly different?
[00:59:19] <imode> you're complaining about not getting senior positions. what exactly have you done.
[00:59:30] <imode> what makes you think you're warranted a senior position.
[00:59:40] <mouseghost> no idea. but not junior either
[00:59:42] <imode> what have you built for companies.
[00:59:46] <mouseghost> for companies? nothing
[00:59:51] <imode> yeah. hence, junior.
[00:59:58] <mouseghost> dumb. i do not like that.
[01:00:00] <imode> you are starting your programming career.
[01:00:09] <mouseghost> but im not a programming newbie
[01:00:14] <imode> junior does not imply programming newbie.
[01:00:28] <imode> that's your first lesson.
[01:00:39] <mouseghost> why does it seem like its correlated?
[01:01:16] <imode> because you know how to write code. you do not know how to design programs to fit business requirements, because you have never been presented with business requirements in the context of working for a company and being paid on their time.
[01:01:33] <imode> you more than likely don't know every single software stack on the planet, and therefore need time to ramp up to the general technical requirements for a given company.
[01:01:53] <mouseghost> hm
[01:02:39] <mouseghost> does that warrant pay thats so different?
[01:02:47] <manicennui> Yes.
[01:02:52] <manicennui> Writing code is the easy part.
[01:02:52] <imode> very much so.
[01:03:45] <mouseghost> manicennui, and the tech stack argument of imode isnt about writing code??
[01:04:31] <imode> knowing how to write code is different than "here are the legos you can use to build the system that addresses our business requirements, figure out how to arrange them appropriately such that they can be maintained"
[01:05:00] <mouseghost> smells of corp ugh
[01:05:07] <imode> no fucking shit.
[01:05:14] <manicennui> Why else would they pay you
[01:05:16] <manicennui> ?
[01:05:32] <manicennui> They are trying to make money. There are problems they need solved so they can make money.
[01:05:45] <imode> and if you help solve those, you make money!
[01:05:50] <manicennui> Engineering is tradeoffs.
[01:06:17] <manicennui> Engineering is not about playing with the tools because they are cool.
[01:07:08] <manicennui> Schedule, budget, future maintenance, scalability, etc.
[01:07:10] <mouseghost> eh eh time to brace myself for doing shit for $10 or less an hour woohoo
[01:07:39] <manicennui> mouseghost: When I graduated high school I worked retail, fast food, order picking, etc.
[01:07:59] <manicennui> I was working before I graduated high school.
[01:08:27] <manicennui> I was able to demonstrate my skills at an office job and got an assistant sys admin role at a small company.
[01:08:36] <imode> mouseghost: how old are you?
[01:08:39] <mouseghost> 18
[01:08:52] <imode> when I was 13, I got a job as a computer technician.
[01:08:55] <manicennui> There are dozens of paths to getting into the profession, but just hoping people will recognize your genius and pay you is not generally one of them.
[01:09:01] <imode> when I was 16, I got a job as a junior sysadmin.
[01:09:07] <imode> don't be a dev until you have to.
[01:09:16] <imode> there are other tech things you can do for money.
[01:09:23] <imode> that honestly provide a nice contrast and still pay >$10/hr.
[01:09:35] <manicennui> I did sys/network admin/help desk for a while, then started getting jobs that were a mix of sys admin/dev.
[01:09:38] <imode> there's no shortage of broken computers and devices, or shops that'll fix them for you.
[01:09:42] <mouseghost> <$10/hr would be junior salary
[01:09:44] <manicennui> imode: He is also not in the US.
[01:09:47] <imode> ah.
[01:09:51] <imode> that is.. different.
[01:09:53] <imode> where you at.
[01:09:55] <mouseghost> pl
[01:10:14] <mouseghost> anyways. i did some projects and i did some freelancing jobs. i was hoping that at least that could be recognized.
[01:10:18] <epilys> mouseghost, why are you expecting jobs with experience without experience?
[01:10:37] <mouseghost> im expecting something to be recognized
[01:10:37] <epilys> what projects?
[01:10:43] <epilys> what's that something?
[01:10:43] <imode> yeah, show us your projects.
[01:10:49] <manicennui> Almost everyone feels like their skills are not being recognized early on, and that they deserve more. Most people eventually realize that they were arrogant.
[01:10:49] <mouseghost> sure https://github.com/dracconi
[01:10:50] <buttsbot> dracconi (_kacper) · GitHub
[01:11:26] <epilys> that's... ugh
[01:11:31] <imode> mm.
[01:11:35] <epilys> like reverse impostor syndrome :p
[01:11:37] <mouseghost> manicennui, well, if people can land a junior job after a bootcamp or something
[01:11:39] <manicennui> Okay, I changed my mind. He writes Janet. Hire him!
[01:11:58] <mouseghost> whats reverse impostor syndrome
[01:11:59] <manicennui> mouseghost: Sure, bootcamps are one path.
[01:12:07] <manicennui> mouseghost: Arrogance.
[01:12:16] <epilys> and/or megalomania
[01:12:25] <epilys> but you're a kid, that's normal
[01:12:30] <epilys> i guess
[01:12:34] <mouseghost> certainly i put more time into learning things than a person who took a 6 months course that guides you by the hand
[01:12:49] <imode> I still think I'm the shit, so what's that say about megalomania. :P
[01:12:53] <imode> gotta believe in yourself.
[01:13:07] <manicennui> mouseghost: You likely have a better technical foundation than a lot of engineers, but now you need the rest, and a good way to signal to employers that you are capable.
[01:13:21] <imode> yeah I'd give you an interview for a junior role.
[01:13:22] <manicennui> Typical signals are university degrees or experience.
[01:13:24] <epilys> mouseghost, these projects tell me "one day project" not "job worthy experience"
[01:13:50] <manicennui> There are other paths, but you have the added hurdle of being in Poland.
[01:13:54] <mouseghost> eh i do plan to go to uni
[01:14:17] <imode> there is some context for this as well, I'm talking from a US standpoint. junior salaries are pretty fucking huge out here.
[01:14:20] <mouseghost> tho in the most optimistic path, i wont be going into programming for the rest of my life. maybe just as a side job, ideally
[01:14:37] <manicennui> We do all of our hiring of junior developers from internships now.
[01:14:38] <buttsbot> 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏
[01:14:49] <imode> do you see it as an artform and you're a craftsman or do you see it as a method of getting shit done(tm).
[01:14:55] <manicennui> We frankly don't need many juniors.
[01:15:05] <manicennui> True seniors are far, far more useful and hard to find.
[01:15:07] <epilys> manicennui, I think almost nobody does
[01:15:13] <epilys> eveeryone is hiring seniors
[01:15:20] <epilys> and there are not enough seniors
[01:15:27] <imode> if everybody's senior then no one is senior.
[01:15:52] <manicennui> The first couple years of one's employment as a software engineer should really be considered an apprenticeship.
[01:16:05] <manicennui> imode: Yeah, we also have everyone expecting to be senior after a few years.
[01:16:19] <manicennui> Can't really fight that anymore if you want to retain people.
[01:16:28] <manicennui> Gotta promote them and just know that the titles don't mean much.
[01:16:34] <mouseghost> junior pay is eh here, as ive just looked
[01:17:08] <epilys> mouseghost, honestly with no uni or work experience and these projects, even junior is too high a target for you
[01:17:15] <imode> yeah..
[01:17:15] <manicennui> mouseghost: Someone with a university degree in CS can easily make $85K+ in the US for their first job.
[01:17:18] <mouseghost> tho hopefully ill go away from that corp shit :) and just be in some r&d thing doing cool things
[01:17:26] <imode> you won't unless you stick with uni.
[01:17:29] <manicennui> mouseghost: Six figures is not uncommon.
[01:17:37] <mouseghost> thats high, then
[01:17:47] <imode> also, like, what epilys said. do you have a resume? any prior employment?
[01:18:01] <epilys> mouseghost, go to uni and forget about employment or research for a few years
[01:18:02] <mouseghost> here junior pay is just average, median pay
[01:18:06] <imode> because to us you're fresh out of high school and did sometoy projects.
[01:18:11] <epilys> that's how it is everyrwhere but USA
[01:18:21] <mouseghost> imode, the toy projects dont bear any significance?
[01:18:24] <epilys> nope
[01:18:28] <mouseghost> how so?
[01:18:34] <epilys> they are just some lines of code?
[01:18:41] <manicennui> mouseghost: The problem is you might be a complete pain in the ass to work with and have unrealistic expectations.
[01:19:09] <imode> are you using them anywhere? do you have a roadmap for them? is anybody else using them that you maintain this software for?
[01:19:37] <imode> do you have a plan for them at all?
[01:19:43] <mouseghost> no, not really
[01:19:44] <imode> any documentation around them that isn't a txt file?
[01:19:57] <imode> well, that's why it's "one day projects".
[01:20:06] <imode> because you aren't actually doing anything but experimenting with code here.
[01:20:10] <manicennui> Documentation. Pfft.
[01:20:15] <mouseghost> epilys, i did some embedded projects that are not public there eh
[01:20:16] <mouseghost> but okay
[01:20:22] <manicennui> Best to just complain about lack of documentation in your retro and move on.
[01:20:37] <imode> fwiw, none of my worth-it projects are public or open source.
[01:20:41] <epilys> mouseghost, like blinking a led or something?
[01:20:44] <mouseghost> nah
[01:21:17] <mouseghost> one was measuring and logging the temperature. done on my own implementation of one wire and sd card wrapper for spi
[01:21:45] <epilys> a toy project then
[01:21:45] * manicennui has no public software.
[01:21:47] <mouseghost> one was making the signal on two pins the same across disconnected two devices
[01:21:55] <imode> having done embedded stuff, the stakes are higher for actual projects.
[01:22:01] <manicennui> The majority of software engineers don't have any public software.
[01:22:23] <imode> https://www.obimed.com/ <-- this fuckin' thing for example.
[01:22:24] <buttsbot> Welcome to O'Brien Medical - O'Brien Medical
[01:22:29] <manicennui> Having stuff on github can be as signal, bug it rarely works by itself.
[01:22:41] <manicennui> s/as signal/a signal/
[01:22:53] <imode> this was one of my first real projects. it is now a commercial product.
[01:22:53] <mouseghost> i liked the radio thing
[01:22:55] <mouseghost> with lora and all
[01:22:58] <manicennui> Unless you are a core contributor to something huge like Kafka or whatever.
[01:23:15] <mouseghost> yeah tell me that being a core contrib. lands you a junior job
[01:23:35] <manicennui> Depends on many things.
[01:23:49] <companion_cube> to be fair, having free software that other people use, properly documented, etc. is a lot of work
[01:23:53] <manicennui> People who gain employment solely based on github are outliers.
[01:24:25] <mouseghost> the one day projects show your ability to do things, though
[01:24:29] <manicennui> Even most of the core contributors have jobs where they use the software.
[01:24:30] <mouseghost> and that you can adapt
[01:24:31] <mouseghost> and all
[01:24:44] <imode> companion_cube: 'course.
[01:24:47] <manicennui> They don't show your ability to do anything other than write some code.
[01:24:53] <mouseghost> how so?
[01:24:54] <imode> but you have to have _some evidence_ that you can follow through with a project.
[01:24:56] <mouseghost> read the documentaiton?
[01:25:00] <manicennui> Which is only part of working as a software engineer.
[01:25:07] <imode> that has more high stakes than "I got bored".
[01:25:11] <mouseghost> ok, so following through with a project, ok..
[01:25:12] <epilys> it's basically calling api/libraries
[01:25:50] <mouseghost> epilys, and what. you do something else in a programming job?
[01:26:06] <epilys> you solve problems
[01:26:16] <epilys> it's not about calling library functions
[01:26:32] <mouseghost> well, my last embedded thing was solving a problem
[01:26:41] <mouseghost> how do you define a problem, then?
[01:27:13] <companion_cube> the hardest thing is to work with other people's code :s
[01:27:17] <companion_cube> I know I struggle with it sometimes
[01:27:29] <manicennui> mouseghost: I am the highest titled person on my team, and I write the least amount of code.
[01:27:38] <mouseghost> then what do you do?
[01:27:49] <manicennui> Make sure shit gets done.
[01:27:58] <manicennui> And I don't mean being a supervisor.
[01:28:11] <epilys> assistant?
[01:28:13] <mouseghost> that fair
[01:28:17] <mouseghost> thats fair
[01:28:24] <manicennui> I interact with various departments and understand the problems.
[01:28:33] <manicennui> I do a lot of architecture and design.
[01:28:36] <mouseghost> if a senior means that, then i certainly do not feel ready for that
[01:28:50] <manicennui> I make sure that other people are considering various tradeoffs.
[01:29:29] <imode> you have two classes of programmers that are traditionally considered, designers and implementors.
[01:29:44] <imode> designers are usually senior, implementors are usually junior/intermediate.
[01:29:55] <imode> it's loosely similar to the architect/construction team split.
[01:30:04] <mouseghost> ok, then i want to be designer :C
[01:30:06] <mouseghost> ehh
[01:30:09] <mouseghost> i dunno
[01:30:13] <mouseghost> i just want mone
[01:30:15] <manicennui> When I do write code, it is basically the end of the process, and it doesn't take much time.
[01:30:18] <imode> prepare to spend more time talking and designing than programming.
[01:30:24] <mouseghost> fine
[01:30:39] <imode> my current project is less than 500 lines of code.
[01:30:40] <manicennui> mouseghost: But that is really why we are paid so much.
[01:30:51] <epilys> if I had more time, I'd have written a shorter letter
[01:30:55] <imode> the code does not matter.
[01:30:58] <mouseghost> so how to prove that with not experience?
[01:31:03] <mouseghost> do i need to make a proper product?
[01:31:09] <manicennui> We take high level desires from other people and use tools to solve problems, given a set of tradeoffs (which we usually have to analyze as well).
[01:31:11] <imode> that'd be one thing you could do.
[01:31:17] <manicennui> Writing code really is the easy part for most software.
[01:31:17] <epilys> mouseghost, experience stuff
[01:31:22] <imode> you can also work your way into the industry via another route.
[01:31:23] <epilys> do internships, actual projects
[01:31:27] <epilys> university
[01:31:36] <companion_cube> imode: it's hard to generalize like that
[01:31:40] <companion_cube> the code can matter?
[01:31:49] <companion_cube> (but then you're at amazon, I'm in a tiny startup)
[01:31:54] <manicennui> The most tried and true path is to obtain a CS degree at university, and do internships your junior/senior years.
[01:32:05] <manicennui> I cannot stress enough what a mistake it is not to do internships.
[01:32:16] <imode> internships, sysadmin/other tech roles (what I did), uni.
[01:32:25] <manicennui> You'll be in a similar boat otherwise, but with debt and a degree.
[01:32:32] <manicennui> Don't expect things to just be handed to you.
[01:32:40] <mouseghost> it seems a bit elaborate to just be someone who sometimes writes a line of code :P unless a junior here means something else than a junior there
[01:33:00] <imode> put it another way.
[01:33:12] <manicennui> mouseghost: The juniors on my team contribute to design in small ways, but their work is mostly determined for them.
[01:33:17] <manicennui> mouseghost: That is the biggest difference.
[01:33:33] <mouseghost> i needed to converse and design things in the freelancing things, tho?
[01:33:37] <imode> the junior builds the plane by following the instructions parsed/conveyed by the intermediate engineers, sourced from designs written by the senior engineers.
[01:33:38] <manicennui> They have some interaction with business people, etc., but they often need direction.
[01:33:51] <mouseghost> btw! i also did some discord bot that connects discord roles to the things bought in a woocommerce shop!
[01:34:31] <imode> do you want to be the guy designing the plane.
[01:34:33] <manicennui> You also have to consider that being a professional software engineer usually means having some involvement in the running of the software you write too.
[01:34:45] <manicennui> And the expectations for that are different for different levels.
[01:34:48] <mouseghost> imode, the plane from the previous sentence or an aircraft?
[01:34:58] <imode> the plane from the previous sentence.
[01:35:07] <manicennui> If things get to a point where the more junior people don't know what to do, I get involved and make sure things are taken care of.
[01:35:07] <mouseghost> yeah
[01:35:07] <imode> and yeah, seniors here contribute to opex et. al.
[01:35:40] <mouseghost> being someone who just executes some orders sounds boring
[01:35:52] <mouseghost> so maybe i shall create that "actual project" indeed
[01:36:02] <mouseghost> hence i asked about if you would buy that thing
[01:36:10] <manicennui> imode loves being on call and sitting on a call for an hour until they determine that his piece isn't related to the problem.
[01:36:10] <mouseghost> but maybe i dont need that to create a project
[01:36:32] <imode> manicennui: if I ever meet you in real life I'll skin you head to toe with nothing but a yubikey.
[01:36:45] <companion_cube> oh hello
[01:36:49] <mouseghost> gotta continue freelancing, then, i guess
[01:36:53] <mouseghost> or create a profitable project...
[01:37:27] <imode> then I'll wear your skin while I'm on the call and go "not my problem".
[01:37:27] <manicennui> mouseghost: The thing is, once you have a job, if the people you work with are any good, they will recognize if you are doing more than just having work dictated to you.
[01:37:40] <mouseghost> eh, i hope it works like that...
[01:37:48] <imode> yeah, the first step is "foot in door".
[01:37:48] <mouseghost> maybe if i move to netherlands it will work out
[01:38:13] <manicennui> We hired a guy who did an internship with us as an SE I (lowest level other than intern), and promoted him to SE II after about a year. We are already talking about promoting him again next year.
[01:38:26] <mouseghost> thats slow tho
[01:38:27] <manicennui> He has very strong technical skills, and he just takes care of things that need doing.
[01:38:31] <manicennui> It isn't.
[01:38:38] <mouseghost> talk to me about money
[01:38:48] <manicennui> He likely makes right around six figures.
[01:38:53] <imode> if you want money there's always GRIIIIIIIFT~
[01:38:58] <manicennui> I don't actually know his salary.
[01:39:00] <mouseghost> so 10^5 manicennui
[01:39:04] <mouseghost> imode, whats that
[01:39:04] <manicennui> We are also not a West Coast company.
[01:39:20] <mouseghost> well, thats a lot of money, ngl...
[01:39:28] <imode> that's more than you've ever conceived of.
[01:39:39] <manicennui> mouseghost: The only people we hire from other countries are people who come here on H1Bs.
[01:39:52] <manicennui> Which we do a lot of.
[01:40:00] <mouseghost> im probalby not moving to the us thoo, so not applicable
[01:40:12] <mouseghost> unless hm
[01:40:20] <manicennui> You'll likely be paid less than half that as an "offshore" developer.
[01:40:24] <epilys> maybe go to uni and start considering these things in 3-4 years
[01:40:33] <epilys> ?
[01:40:34] <mouseghost> i will go to uni
[01:40:34] <imode> or to community college.
[01:40:40] <imode> not sure what the polish equiv. is.
[01:40:41] <mouseghost> tho i wont be doing CS in uni
[01:40:44] <mouseghost> university, yeah
[01:40:57] <imode> community college is usually cheaper.
[01:40:59] <mouseghost> i want to be another type of engineer, a real one
[01:41:07] <manicennui> heh
[01:41:10] <epilys> haha
[01:41:10] <imode> I have no doubt you will be.
[01:41:10] <mouseghost> imode, unis are cheap here too. its not anglophone world ;p
[01:41:14] <mouseghost> 2k eur a year for an uni
[01:41:20] <imode> _damn_.
[01:41:23] <mouseghost> is that much?
[01:41:27] <imode> no, that's cheap af.
[01:41:29] <mouseghost> comparing to the uk, its cheapo
[01:41:30] <mouseghost> ye
[01:41:34] <epilys> here they are ~free~
[01:41:37] <imode> good for you. you'll be fine.
[01:41:38] <mouseghost> because these are public unis
[01:41:41] <mouseghost> epilys, in poland as well
[01:41:49] <mouseghost> but i dont want to study here, in the optimistic route
[01:41:55] <imode> you're 18. I'm 26. and at my position, I'm the youngest.
[01:41:58] <mouseghost> hm
[01:42:02] <manicennui> Our public universities are more like $15k USD per year.
[01:42:03] <imode> you have time.
[01:42:06] <mouseghost> and you're a junior ;p? imode
[01:42:08] <manicennui> For in-state students.
[01:42:11] <imode> no, I'm an intermediate engineer.
[01:42:14] <mouseghost> hell, thats a lot manicennui
[01:42:19] <imode> L5 at Amazon.
[01:42:23] <imode> just a step below senior.
[01:42:25] <mouseghost> hmmm
[01:42:33] <manicennui> mouseghost: Yeah, which is why so many people in the US have a fuckton of student debt.
[01:42:44] <mouseghost> i know. same in uk afaik
[01:42:46] <imode> fwiw mouseghost, I also don't have a degree.
[01:42:49] <manicennui> Out-of-state tuition is more, and a lot of people go to private universities.
[01:43:07] <mouseghost> i want to go to either aerospace and do some space things maybe or electrical eng. and do embedded stuff
[01:43:12] <mouseghost> in telecom probably
[01:43:18] <mouseghost> thats what i want to do ^
[01:43:21] <manicennui> mouseghost: Sounds like a good path.
[01:43:26] <manicennui> mouseghost: Why bother with this computer shit?
[01:43:37] <imode> the most important lesson I can possibly give anybody worrying about money or career stuff is that.. you have time. like, all the time. the previous 18+ years of your life were preparing you for a much larger experience, and you're in control of what you do for the next 70+ years.
[01:43:41] <mouseghost> side-job? way to sustain myself if something goes wrong? plan b? manicennui
[01:43:43] <manicennui> Trying to make money from computer shit I mean.
[01:43:54] <manicennui> I see.
[01:43:55] <mouseghost> plus, its fun
[01:44:06] <manicennui> Life isn't supposed to be fun!
[01:44:08] <mouseghost> though i do like electrical/embedded things a lot
[01:44:18] <imode> so go into embedded!
[01:44:22] <mouseghost> much more than strictly computer things, i think
[01:44:26] <mouseghost> ill see, ill see
[01:44:27] <companion_cube> embedded sounds like a good route yeah
[01:44:29] <imode> go into uni, do embedded shit. go hit up makerspaces.
[01:44:30] <companion_cube> learn some Ada
[01:44:31] <epilys> go to ECE uni and _s_t_o_p thinking about work for now
[01:44:32] <companion_cube> oops :-°
[01:44:37] <imode> yeah, seriously.
[01:44:39] <mouseghost> whats ece
[01:44:45] <mouseghost> ah
[01:44:45] <imode> electrical and computer engineering.
[01:44:48] <epilys> i thought you knew everything? :P
[01:44:52] <mouseghost> nuu
[01:44:56] <imode> fwiw they never claimed that.
[01:44:57] <mouseghost> i dont know your salary, for one
[01:45:03] <epilys> imode, I'm teasing
[01:45:06] <imode> :P
[01:45:07] <mouseghost> rawr
[01:45:38] <imode> when I was 18, you know what I was doing? gearing up to go to community college for computer systems technology. computer repair and networking.
[01:45:40] <epilys> I'm freelancing but currently it's 192k usd per year
[01:45:42] <manicennui> If I had actually planned my career, I would not have done computer shit.
[01:45:42] <mouseghost> i want to be independent. have monies and all ;-; and thats my main point in having a well paid (side)job
[01:45:49] <imode> I didn't know what the _fuck_ I was gonna do after that.
[01:45:51] <mouseghost> epilys, thats a lot o;
[01:45:57] <mouseghost> you have your own company or something?
[01:46:03] <epilys> one person company
[01:46:11] <mouseghost> and people call you?
[01:46:13] <epilys> for tax purposes
[01:46:32] <mouseghost> "hello i would like an electric collar, how much -- 10k thank u"
[01:46:38] <epilys> i was just lucky to land good gigs
[01:46:40] <epilys> for now
[01:46:40] <imode> lmfao.
[01:46:47] <mouseghost> epilys, on some site?
[01:46:57] <imode> yeah, you don't have to finalize your life when you're 18. that's the last thing you wanna do.
[01:47:05] <imode> you wanna explore and do fun shit.
[01:47:11] <imode> go get some financial aid and fuck around for a while.
[01:47:11] <epilys> mouseghost, no, they emailed me, in all cases.
[01:47:15] <mouseghost> hmm
[01:47:27] <mouseghost> imode, go get drugs?
[01:47:29] <manicennui> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micha%C5%82_So%C5%82owow
[01:47:29] <buttsbot> Michał Sołowow - Wikipedia
[01:47:34] <imode> ...fuck around productively.
[01:47:40] <epilys> and safely
[01:47:42] <manicennui> Polish billionaire who was a rally car driver.
[01:47:43] <manicennui> WIld.
[01:48:38] <manicennui> "Sołowow studied at Kielce University of Technology."
[01:50:16] <epilys> Solo wow.
[01:50:41] <epilys> Is that crossed l the "w" one?
[01:50:44] <epilys> Sowo wow
[01:51:06] <manicennui> vov?
[01:51:48] <epilys> I know the word mgła is pronounced mgwah
[01:53:16] <mouseghost> Sowovof
[01:53:17] <mouseghost> imo
[01:53:19] <manicennui> Sounds like he did some work in the West and used the money to start a company in Poland.
[01:53:57] <imode> sounds about right.
[01:54:05] <imode> that's a common pattern.
[01:54:29] <manicennui> And then made a fuckton of money through investments.
[01:54:48] <mouseghost> ok. so i need to invest
[01:55:30] <manicennui> I think you missed the first few steps.
[01:55:54] <mouseghost> go to the west?
[01:55:58] <imode> buy crypto
[01:56:00] <imode> clearly.
[01:56:03] <manicennui> Go to university.
[01:56:20] <mouseghost> fineee... ill gooo
[01:56:35] <mouseghost> the thing he finished is not even well known
[01:57:10] <epilys> don't compare yourself to outliers
[01:57:23] <mouseghost> he certainly is an outlier
[01:57:29] <mouseghost> tho i wish i could make a company as welllll
[01:57:30] <mouseghost> like
[01:57:35] <mouseghost> get money from rich folk
[01:57:38] <mouseghost> start a company
[01:57:40] <mouseghost> become a richman
[01:57:54] <manicennui> More likely the company fails or the rich folk screw you.
[01:58:51] <manicennui> The most common path to (moderate) wealth in the US is working as a professional and managing one's money well.
[02:00:59] <mouseghost> maybe if i pretend to be a richman, other rich folks will make me rich
[02:01:40] <imode> literally the NFT market.
[02:01:42] <manicennui> Have you tried being born rich?
[02:02:24] <mouseghost> manicennui, failed :c
[02:02:29] <manicennui> Ask your parents for a small, $100k loan...
[02:02:49] <mouseghost> manicennui, what next?
[02:03:07] <manicennui> You inherit the rest of their money.
[02:03:21] <manicennui> Then pretend like you are a self-made millionaire.
[02:03:33] <manicennui> And write books for idiots on how to become a millionaire.
[02:03:59] <mouseghost> lol
[02:04:00] <mouseghost> true
[02:04:34] <manicennui> You could probably start with writing the book and fool a good number of people.
[02:07:36] <mouseghost> nice biz idea, will try
[02:07:40] <mouseghost> also could sell drugs to kids
[02:07:52] <manicennui> Or start an onlyfans.
[02:08:27] <epilys> nice /s
[02:08:39] <mouseghost> could do that too
[02:08:55] <mouseghost> manicennui, do you think a more fetish audience will be more profitable?
[02:09:25] <manicennui> No idea.
[02:09:38] <manicennui> But assuming you are in shape, plenty of gay men will probably be interested.
[02:09:50] <manicennui> And if you aren't, some gay men will be interested anyways.
[02:10:32] <imode> what did I tab back to.
[02:10:41] <mouseghost> some women as well, i guess
[02:11:10] <manicennui> I'm guessing that like 90% of the people who pay for onlyfans are men.
[02:13:23] <epilys> You're talking to a kid...
[02:14:14] <manicennui> He is 18
[02:15:50] <manicennui> I'm pretty sure he realizes that this isn't a serious suggestion.
[02:15:59] <manicennui> And has seen porn before.
[02:19:31] <mouseghost> yes and yes
[02:19:34] <mouseghost> and yes
[02:19:50] <mouseghost> i got carried away to look at organic chemistry
[02:26:05] <mouseghost> anyone has $100 laying around?
[02:31:28] <imode> why.
[02:32:41] <manicennui> I'm not signing up for your onlyfans
[02:34:33] <mouseghost> imode, i want a padauk writer
[02:35:00] <mouseghost> maybe eevblog has one and doesnt need it, or the padauk themselves have one laying around hhmmm...
[02:37:12] <imode> I mean.
[02:37:21] <imode> nobody is just going to give you money, dude.
[02:37:58] <mouseghost> :<

[20:10:38] <companion_cube> that's a valid point
[20:10:49] <companion_cube> I mean, you should get a mix, and hopefully your staff isn't all theory oriented
[20:10:49] <ngoldbaum> also tons of bad pegagogy where you might be teaching people what a linked list is but you’re not really teaching them how to deal with them IRL in a real codebase
[20:10:52] <cb> i want to save young minds from unix
[20:11:13] <companion_cube> the only way to get students to learn a bit of proper coding is projects, imho
[20:11:19] <companion_cube> possibly in (small) teams

[20:36:42] <Geekingfrog> asymptomatic my ass -_-" Felt like shit for a solid 10 days
[20:39:08] <companion_cube> assymptomatic?
[20:39:18] <companion_cube> had you had a booster? :)
[20:39:33] <Geekingfrog> 1 months too early for that
[20:39:41] <companion_cube> ah, well, that could make a difference :s
