[01:24:36] <ada_> kevr: you can't reduce the management plane to less than 1
[01:24:43] <ada_> kevr: the swarm requires at least 1 manager
[01:25:00] <kevr> ada_: But if I just want to stop the swarm, I run into tons of blockers about there being a manager.
[01:25:03] <ada_> kevr: if you demote the only remaining manager, using --force, it breaks the management plane and you'd need to re-initailze the swarm
[01:25:07] <kevr> How do I gracefully stop the manager from managing?
[01:25:08] <ada_> what does "stop the swarm" mean to you
[01:25:17] <kevr> `docker swarm leave` with one node left in it.
[01:25:33] <ada_> then, you have an answer
[01:25:42] <ada_> if you don't care about maintaining the swarm, then it's irrelevant
[01:25:56] <kevr> ada_: But if I did want to maintain the swarm, how would I do it?
[01:25:56] <ada_> if you did that to a swarm with services running on it, you'd be unable to make changes to teh cluster without adding more managers
[01:25:59] <kevr> That's what I'm asking.
[01:26:05] <ada_> you can't have a swarm and not have a swarm at the same time
[01:26:14] <kevr> Uh.
[01:26:14] <ada_> its either on or off, and if it's on, it requires that there be >1 manager
[01:26:16] <kevr> What I'm asking is
[01:27:19] <kevr> Okay, heres the trouble in my understanding: There should be a way to completely empty the swarm without using --force. Or is --force the standard way to do so because it just doesn't make sense to have a swarm with no managers?
[01:27:29] <kevr> In which case, wouldn't there be like a... docker swarm down, or something?
[01:27:35] *** Joins: terrorjack (~terrorjac@static.3.200.12.49.clients.your-server.de)
[01:28:03] <ada_> if you only have 1 node, you would docker swarm leave --force
[01:28:21] <zoredache> Deleting a swarm has a potential to delete data like your secrets, configs, and so on. Requiring a force there as a confirmation sure seems like a good idea from a usability point of view.
[01:28:38] <kevr> ah, gotcha. i was assuming here that --force was a forced way to do something properly.
[01:29:02] <ada_> in this case, it's to prevent you from accidentally nuking your swarm log, which maintains the swarm state
[01:29:24] <kevr> which normally means that you're bypassing other parts of the tool with --force to make something occur, in a lot of programs, this means that you break sync with things internally.
[01:29:26] <ada_> and yes it would nuke your secrets, configs, and the state of any services that were deployed
[01:29:29] <kevr> So, I was just paranoid.
[01:30:01] <kevr> cleared up: thank you!

[02:35:23] <atrigent> hello all. docker compose v2 seems to have broken my ability to access my workplace's registry mirror, which is only accessibly behind our vpn. this is on a mac. the error suggests that it is not properly using the vpn's DNS server. docker compose v1 and base docker work fine. is this a known issue?
[02:36:11] <BtbN> Isn't docker compose just a bunch of python scripts invoking docker? I doubt it is involved at that level.
[02:37:47] <atrigent> I believe it is written in go like most of these tools are. but yes, I would have assumed as well that it would simply defer to docker for image pulls. and yet here we are.
[02:43:39] <BtbN> When I install docker-compose it pulls like 200 python deps
[02:43:51] <programmerq> do you mean the new 'docker compose' thing that is a docker cli plugin?
[02:44:41] <BtbN> Seems like 1.x is python, 2.x is a full rewrite in go

[02:53:09] <zoredache> atrigent: docker compose shouldn't need to know anything about which DNS server to use, it probably just does a system call gethostbyname or something. If your client is configured with multiple DNS servers, and one gives an NXDOMAIN for a record that is valid from another server, then your DNS is broken, and that really isn't a problem with compose.
[02:53:18] <zoredache> You were probably just getting lucky in the ordering.
[02:55:40] <programmerq> yeah, as far as I can tell, the new go docker compose v2 stuff will send a POST /v1.41/images/create?fromImage=nginx&tag=alpine that looks the same as the one that other docker cli clients send. Can you include more details about how you have your docker desktop configured to use the pull-through registry mirror?
[02:55:59] <programmerq> can you do a 'docker run' and hit the registry mirror endpoint from a normal container like with curl?
[02:57:56] <atrigent> zoredache: I don't have any DNS configuration in docker
[02:58:34] <atrigent> @programmerq: I just tried curling to the URL in the error message and it works
[03:00:59] <zoredache> Oh, I am noticing you are on a Mac. Doesn't that use a VM for docker? I wonder if you need to restart the VM or something after the VM gets connected.

[11:34:04] <seabass> Hello! I've come across this file in a project I'm working on, and I'm wondering if it's to do with Docker.
[11:34:25] <seabass> it is called .env.default, and is in the root of the project

[11:35:05] *** Joins: tex (~super@user/dix)
[11:35:21] <seabass> it's just a list of environment variables (set in a way which would be valid shell, but it has no hashbang line)
[11:37:50] *** Joins: mickey8 (~user@user/mickey)
[11:38:01] <seabass> ah, it really is just a shell file
[11:38:04] <zoredache> seabass: look at the example docker compose file, I would expect that is refering to the .env or something, and you are expected to make a copy or rename it or somthing
[11:38:49] <seabass> zoredache: thanks! That seems to be it
[11:39:09] <seabass> so it seems as if you must rename it to .env to test the API locally
[11:39:30] *** Quits: Oceanwatcher (~Oceanwatc@user/oceanwatcher) (Quit: Leaving)
[11:39:46] <zoredache> Or make a copy. Often the case of environment variables, the assumption is that you must change at least some of them.

[13:32:17] <oskie> I've seen this a couple of times now, Docker gets stuck when you stop/start a container. 'systemctl stop docker' (or start) no longer works. 'systemctl stop docker.socket' also is stuck
[13:32:49] <oskie> any ideas what to do without restarting the system?
[13:34:36] <seabass> oskie: not sure about the specific issue, but you can run journalctl -u docker to find more information
[13:34:50] <dodo> and check the logs of the containers that don't stop?
[13:35:52] <oskie> it's just that there are no logs, nothing in systemd journal, nothing in 'dmesg', etc
[13:36:01] <seabass> oh wow
[13:36:11] <seabass> that's a unusual lack of logs
[13:36:38] <seabass> I think there might be something wrong with your host system; dmesg is usually very verbose with output
[13:36:55] *** Joins: SteveR (~SteveR@103.215.168.1)
[13:37:46] <oskie> it's just that it has happened a couple of times before, and one thing is that Docker needs to be updated so perhaps that can help, but I don't understand how you not can kill a unit with systemd 
[13:38:24] <seabass> oskie: indeed; that's why it sounds to me like your host system is broken somehow
[13:38:34] <seabass> maybe make a test systemd unit and try to kill that?
[13:43:24] <oskie> other units can be started/stopped. It is just that stopping docker.socket is impossible (stuck), starting docker is also stuck - but if I interrupt it, it will be 'failed' and the last two messages will be:

[22:58:24] <steerpike> hi, do write operations to volume mapped directories contribute to the increased size of the container?
[23:06:16] <zoredache> guess it depends on what you mean by container? Some might argue the volume is part of the running container, so yes. It won't change the size of the image though. And the writes probably will only be in the volume.

[23:11:20] <programmerq> steerpike▸ a volume is a directory that is not part of the container's write layer.
