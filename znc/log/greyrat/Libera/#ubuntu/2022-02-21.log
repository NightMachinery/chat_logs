[00:01:27] <dragon_> matsaman, I have tried both running Teams in browser, and installing the app, there are two option for linux
[00:02:00] <tomreyn> DebianNB: is windows selectable from the uefi boot menu? not grub, but the one of your mainboard firmware (UEFI 'BIOS')
[00:02:06] <matsaman> dragon_: well pick which approach you want to work on, and then tell the channel the errors you're getting
[00:02:11] <dragon_> In browser I am told, to find a compatible browser like Edge
[00:02:56] <matsaman> dragon_: from Firefox?
[00:03:14] <dragon_> yes I am in Firefox
[00:03:19] <DebianNB> tomreyn now because was in the damged disk UFEI dir
[00:03:24] <tomreyn> DebianNB: if so, use that to switch between the two OSes, its the better approach over trying to chainload windows through grub
[00:04:20] <tomreyn> you could try whether installing os-prober will result in a windows option being added to grub. but that's no longer the recommended approach.
[00:04:36] <dragon_> Package teams, Status; Error cannot satisfy dependencies
[00:04:37] <DebianNB> tomreyn i dont have the win via any anything, but the disk B with win10 is untouched, i need just a section or any tool to added it in grub again.

[00:05:56] <dragon_> matsaman, I am in lubuntu 21.10
[00:05:59] <tomreyn> DebianNB: this very much sounds like a windows question to me, really, you should try to make some windows recovery tool re-add windows bootcode to your efi system partition and efivars.
[00:06:33] <xmetal> hmm @ Microsoft offers a DEB and RPM for that software but doesn't say what distro's they are for (i mean say what Ubuntu BASE its for)
[00:06:34] <dragon_> matsaman, noone in the lubuntu channel used teams or web conferance software at all
[00:06:43] <DebianNB> thanks any way but isn't win question.

[02:25:40] <jhutchins> goddard: The idea is that elevated permissions should not be seamless, there should be an additional step required, essentially for confirmation that you want to break the non-privileged mode,
[02:26:43] <jhutchins> goddard: The premise being that privileged mode allows you to break things outside of your own sequestered domain.

[02:27:22] <goddard> maybe just a preference option to disable the training wheels mode then?
[02:27:52] <goddard> sometimes it would be nice to use nautilus via sftp and use sudo to move and copy files and other stuff
[02:28:06] <jhutchins> goddard: It's not training wheels, it's good discipline.  Otherwise why even require elevated permissions?  Have flat access like DOS.
[02:28:29] <goddard> because it requires you to authenticate
