[20:45:45] <ke4nhw> Hi all. I have run an OpenVPN server once before, but it's been quite some time since I set one up. I am setting up into the same environment as before. I notice that openvpn is on the Centos 7 EPEL repo, however when I installed it, it came with nothing. <cont>
[20:48:09] <ke4nhw> The /etc/openvpn was empty except for two empty folders, server and client. It did however come with the service files (or templates as I remember them lol). No easy-rsa, no config files, no tools to generate the server cert, nothing. Where are all the tools? Should i just port everything from my previous install in (copy/paste all files and their directory structures) and copy over my old 
[20:48:09] <ke4nhw> service file?
[20:50:15] <ke4nhw> Or should I use a different repo (the website mentions a new repo, https://as-repository.openvpn.net/as-repo-centos7.rpm, but that does not look familiar from my last install. Is there other optional packages I should install?
[20:52:53] <mzar> ke4nhw: please feel free to populate directories with your config files
[20:54:34] <ordex> ke4nhw: it pretty much depends on you..you may install easy-rsa and generate a new PKI. or just re-use what you had before
[20:54:43] <ordex> configurations have never ben part of the default installation
[20:55:46] <mzar> ke4nhw: maybe you can switch to FreeBSD?  in FreeBSD a template of server config file is installed
[20:55:58] <ke4nhw> Okay, that would actually make things easier. Can I do the same with the service file? Copy my service file over?
[20:56:43] <ordex> the service file is probably more tied to the distro/system you are running on
[20:56:46] <ke4nhw> Something to consider. The reason I was worried about the missing template files was I was concerned about a possible botched install of openvpn
[20:56:49] <ordex> ke4nhw: but why CentOS7 ?
[20:56:52] <ordex> it's quite old..
[20:59:23] <ke4nhw> Because 8 is EOL, everything else is now "stream". My goal is to port all this over to RHEL 8 now that I have the license for it. There's a bit of a difference between centos 7 and rhel 8 so I am going to build my rhel 8 in a vm so I can also deal with the learning curve there (instead of on a production server). So, goal is 4 to 6 months to full RHEL 8.
[21:00:21] <mzar> FreeBSD works fine as OS for OpenVPN hub, the only drawback is that DCO module is not developed for this OS
[21:01:13] <ordex> ke4nhw: what's the problem with stream?
[21:01:24] <ordex> anyway, also just going straight to RHEL8 should be fine
[21:01:26] <ke4nhw> I'll look into FreeBSD and spin it up in a vm to check it out
[21:02:05] <ordex> why not any other distro though? you could have Fedora, Debian or Ubuntu Server too
[21:02:18] <ordex> switching to a totally different OS sounds much more time consuming
[21:02:22] <ordex> but it's up to you :)
[21:02:29] *** Quits: csrf (~csrf@user/csrf) (Quit: ZNC 1.7.2+deb3 - https://znc.in)
[21:02:56] <ke4nhw> Same as with Fedora... I love them both, they're great for just regular day to day use. However, on a server, I need stability and reliability, and when you have a "testbed" OS upstream of an end product, there's always changes, full version upgrades, and shorter EOL's.
[21:03:14] *** Joins: csrf (~csrf@user/csrf)
[21:03:24] <ordex> sure
[21:03:34] <ordex> normally I Deploy debian on servers (or ubuntu server)
[21:03:46] <ordex> I named Fedora because it is part of the same family
[21:03:54] <mzar> I am using FreeBSD since early 2000s'
[21:03:59] <ke4nhw> I tried Debian and ubuntu, they're great, just different. I came up on Fedora, then Centos, now RHEL. I just am used to the Red Hat family.
[21:04:11] <ordex> hehe
[21:04:50] <mzar> for OpenVPN, I used the OS earlier 
[21:06:59] <ke4nhw> Yep, I still play with Fedora as well, but they make it clear: it's a testbed for the latest tech and toys, so problems can and do occur, and their version time is very short, leading to frequent clean installs (and associated downtime if it's on the hardware) or frequent vm builds for vm server deployments.
[21:07:48] <ordex> ke4nhw: I have not understood yet why you haven't gone with RHEL8 yet?
[21:07:53] <ke4nhw> Still love it though, it's cool to see what's headed down the pipe to me
[21:10:10] <ke4nhw> Because I only recently found out about the devel / individual licensing being acceptable for small production environments, so I'm just not getting to working with RHEL 8. There are differences between that and Centos 7 which is what I am currently running, so a learning curve. I'm spinning it up in VM, and I'll tackle my learning curve there <cont>
[21:11:18] <ke4nhw> while building the servers there as well. Once it's built, I can do an overnighter to wipe, install, copy all the configs, and be back online before the sun comes up. No end user interruptions.
[21:13:48] <ke4nhw> But you've given me something to think about. I'll spin up a few more vm's check out how nicely some of the other big name flavors play with the servers and services I need to provide. VM's are great for that.
[21:15:14] <ordex> yup yup
[21:16:31] *** Joins: Snegodick (~ne@user/Snegodick)
[21:24:59] <ke4nhw> Now should I install easy-rsa or since it's already in the folder I'll be copying (my old OpenVPN directory into the new OpenVPN directory) is it necessary to actually yum install it?
[21:26:55] <ke4nhw> And should I install other packages such as NetworkManager-openvpn.x86_64 : NetworkManager VPN plugin for OpenVPN, kde-plasma-networkmanagement-openvpn.x86_64 : OpenVPN support for kde-plasma-networkmanagement-extras, etc?
[21:28:15] <ordex> it all boils down to what you need
[21:32:11] <ke4nhw> Here's the basic lowdown: I want to configure my server, currently running Samba, will be running a few other things, such that no connections can come in except via the VPN, which is why I am creating the vpn server directly on that machine. That includes ssh. There are a few machines that will need the ability to interact directly with each other <cont>
[21:33:37] <ke4nhw> such as the laptop being able to use remote desktop to another machine in the network (again all using the VPN addresses) (kernel forwarding is turned on, I'll add the iptables forwarding rules prn). 
[21:34:47] <ke4nhw> So the VPN will be the rule for all server connections in-network, remote, wherever, and people can remote desktop their machines located here from anywhere using the VPN-assigned addresses.

[21:35:30] <ke4nhw> I believe last time it created an interface, tun0, so it does need that.
[21:35:58] <ke4nhw> I hope that's understandable, sometimes I don't really know how to verbalize what it is I am trying to achieve.
[21:39:26] <ke4nhw> With this setup I get two things in one: first of all, I get a VPN solution for direct server access and remote desktop for machines outside the local network, and I get additional security for the server by forcing all connections to the server to be through the VPN tunnel (additional encryption and additional authentication).
[21:40:10] <ke4nhw> ordex does that make sense?

[23:07:54] <ke4nhw> I can't remember: Does OpenVPN create tun0 when it is started, or do I have to manually create tun0, and if so, what is the best way to do this? I don't remember having to do it before, but just checking.

[23:52:26] <ke4nhw> wow. I unfortunately didn't grow up Linux, I grew up back in the days before Windows 3.0, on straight DOS, and a GUI that slightly predated Windows, Geoworks (I think the name was). I remember the good ol' 1200 baud modem, and the Internet as we know it didn't exist. There was stuff like the BBS (usually running on Wildcat) and then came CompuServe, Prodigy, and AOL.
[23:52:45] <ke4nhw> not sure on the Prodigy, may have been called something else.
[23:53:31] <ke4nhw> And web pages, as we know them, were sparse, and usually limited to information similar to encyclopedia's.
[23:55:04] <ke4nhw> I was unfortunately still trapped in the DOS/Windows world. I didn't discover the beauty of Linux till much later. Now I wish all the software I need today would run on Linux so I could escape the Microslut trap and go all RedHat
[23:55:48] <mzar> ha ... same here, I grew up in terms of computer usage
