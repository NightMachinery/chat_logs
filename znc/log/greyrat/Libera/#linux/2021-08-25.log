[02:26:37] <neshpion> other than hoping the failed command prints its *own* error message to stderr before failling
[02:26:45] <windowsuser> cuppajoe: use Python with the "sh" library. Best of both worlds.

[02:29:28] <uwharrie> cuppajoe: you'll probably end up needing to do both, picking up both syntax and elementary usage of commands. once you've got the basics of flow and job control down, you can dive deeper into individual commands

[02:32:47] <windowsuser> cuppajoe: I'll just say it one more time. maybe if you're still living in the 80s, writing bash would be a good idea. Or if you want to write very portable scripts, meaning targetting a platform which for some reason doesnt have Python, like some calculator. Otherwise, use Python. You will waste so much writing and troubleshooting bash scripts,
[02:32:47] <windowsuser> compared to Python, you're at 10% efficiency.

[02:33:39] <neshpion> cuppajoe: to contrast that opinion, i just feel like bash is *way* more ready-to-hand, especially in interactive mode
[02:33:39] <n4dir> thing is that sooner or later you will run into bash scripts you want to or have to understand. So the basics won't hurt.
[02:33:46] <jim> well 10% is a bit extreme

[02:35:19] <n4dir> understanding that difference is probably a lot already. But enough of a noob
[02:35:29] <neshpion> cuppajoe: the best way to approach bash, in my experience, is knowing that there are no types and everything is a string, and also pipelines are almost like functional programming

[02:35:30] <cuppajoe> I mean, from what i've read so far, the syntax isn't too difficult to learn, especially coming from python, so I might as well learn bash if the commands will be the same
[02:35:38] <rascul> bash isn't the devil, it's ok to write bash scripts

[02:38:03] <cuppajoe> so I think the bottom line from all of this is: learn bash, use it for what its good at, it won't hurt to learn something new
[02:38:04] <PaulFertser> I would suggest to avoid writing anything non-trivial in shell (including bash). If you can use some other more modern scripting language on this system, better consider that.
[02:38:28] <jim> gentoo? hmm. that's pretty raw... how do you like gentoo?
[02:38:47] <n4dir> cuppajoe: and if you have a given problem and ask in #bash, they will right away tell you that a solution in python (which you know) is better. Assuming thats the case
[02:38:55] * neshpion develops genthree
[02:39:01] <onelegend> nice
[02:39:06] <n4dir> isn't it called gentoe?
[02:39:09] <PaulFertser> My experience with shell scripts is that you start doing something, seems easy, and then some nasty edge-cases make it much more complicated.
[02:39:22] <akoana> cuppajoe: using a shell / bash is way more efficient than doing the same stuff python with the sh library...

[02:41:40] <cuppajoe> PaulFertser: ooooh, thanks for the tip. As I have been following along on tutorials, I've been doing /bin/sh, so I'll make sure to use /bin/bash in the future

[02:42:10] <cuppajoe> CoderCop: interesting point
[02:42:42] <CoderCop> @MetalSutton - I think Buster recently went from "stable" to "oldstable." If your sources.list is pointed at buster and your default-release is stable, it would mean that you are telling it "i want stable" without giving it any "stable" repos.
[02:42:44] <n4dir> though, MetalSutton , if you have set a Default, than you sure have a bit more complex sources.list.
[02:42:44] <PaulFertser> cuppajoe: it's ok to use !/bin/sh if you stick to POSIX syntax only. And please use shellcheck (it's in Haskell btw).

[02:50:08] <phogg> if all you do with sed is -e 's///' then consider perl -pe 's///' as a replacement with a more powerful regex dialect.

[02:59:26] <CoderCop> phogg, I'll add it to the list. I can't say I know much of anything about it, honestly.
[02:59:57] <phogg> that was a more interesting experience than Ada, which it turns out to be a direct ancestor of PL/SQL and thus not entirely foreign (by the time I tried to learn it)
[03:00:11] <akoana> CoderCop: for maintainability, I tend to pick one of the oldest languages for now, I've seen too much changes that break existing code (python2 -> python3, perl -> raku and so on)
[03:00:28] <akoana> phogg: true, Ada is not bad
[03:01:16] <CoderCop> akoana, I think there is a balance to be found there. The python2 -> 3 change broke stuff, but one could code many mid-sized projects in python twice in the time it would take to code it in something like C once....and probably with fewer bugs.
[03:01:37] <akoana> CoderCop: I didn't mean C :)
[03:01:48] <phogg> CoderCop: I think that it depends more on your set of libraries

[03:05:18] <uwharrie> perl has sort of split into dialects with the older noisy perl4 style and the newer "modern perl" perl5 style. working on a disciplined codebase done in the latter style isn't that bad

[07:20:09] <Psi-Jack> Is there a reason you chose *locate, specifically?
[07:20:25] <Psi-Jack> Because, find, could do this and give you exact output format you want from results.
[07:20:31] <eharmonic> no - it was what mandriva used and i stuck with it

[07:21:08] <eharmonic> find is very slow compared to slocate

[07:21:13] <jmcantrell> Psi-Jack: yeah, but locate is much faster
[07:21:31] <Psi-Jack> It can be, yes. But is also way more limited in what it specifically can do.
[07:21:37] <Psi-Jack> (and what details it indexes)

[07:51:57] <ayecee> if the goal is to use docker to reduce administrative overhead, preparing patches for it is the opposite of that.
[07:52:01] <CoderCop> I would be interested to read a security analysis of snap vs docker. With a docker image, a vulnerability in the software would (theoretically) only give the attacker access to the docker filesystem and whatever paths you have intentionally shared unless it were paired with a vulnerability in docker itself. With snap, wouldn't the same software vulnerability give them access to whatever that user
[07:52:04] <CoderCop> could access on your system?
[07:52:09] <Psi-Jack> Assuming the default bridge of 172.<current+1>.0.0/16 or 172.17.0.0/16 is what Docker does for a default network.

I used timeshift to backup kernel 4.19 before upgrading to 5.10, and then use the timeshift restore tool in rsync, and it carried the error back to Kernel 4.19.  However, it was reported in the Debian channel.  They allege Bullseye is stable, but Bullseye still has problems.  The only reason I updated was so that I could get access to wifi drivers, and they are still absent.  Earlier in the year 5.10 crashed, and I returned
[10:58:12] <urk> to 4.19 which is super stable.

[11:00:29] <pizzalovingnerd> It was case sensitivity.
[11:00:35] <urk> mrpaxton[m]:  I am skeptical it is xfce's fault.  Typically one of the two menu bars will disappear if xfce is to blame.  Additionally I wouldn't think that an error in syslog would point to the display manager if there wasn't something wrong with it.  Still my experience should alert the development team as to the severity of the problem.  I think trying a different display manager is worth looking at before doing a reinstall.  I am not convinced that
[11:00:35] <urk> Timeshift will solve the problem since the display manager error is being carried over.

[11:49:04] <mrjpaxton[m]> I almost see the end of repos happening in the next several years.

[14:07:45] <epolanski> hey all, I'm quite ignorant about users and permissions. I have a docker image in which I create a user, add to its home folder an .ssh folder during build and then I try to git clone a repo. It was failing due to no permissions for .ssh folder, the mimimun rule I could apply for ssh git to work was 050
[14:08:07] <epolanski> why does it works for 050 but not 500
[14:08:37] <epolanski> I mean sudo chmod -R 050 /home/foo/.ssh

[23:15:11] <Dagmar> donofrio: It spits them out to STDOUT.  Actually storing the keys somewhere is considered a "you" problem
[23:15:12] <donofrio> I have a controller and six nodes and I want to collect the six nodes keys so I can just ssh to a node and it just works
[23:15:18] <CoderCop> donofrio: ssh-keyscan gathers public keys. For password-less login, you'd need to put your private key in the authorized_keys file on those servers. Take a look at ssh-copy-id for that.

[23:20:46] <Dagmar> donofrio: Primarily of interest is the addToKnownHosts function.  If you call `addToKnownHosts someservername` it'll invoke the ssh-keyscan and go ahead and store those keys, _hashed_ in ~/.ssh/known_hosts.

[23:26:36] <Dagmar> It's also a bash script
[23:26:43] <Dagmar> Not an sh-compatible script
[23:26:55] <Dagmar> It doesn't take arguments either.
[23:26:59] <donofrio> so chmod it?
[23:27:07] <Dagmar> It is literally just a file containing bash _functions_
[23:27:39] <Dagmar> No, but if you want a quick and dirty you can just do `source thatfile.sh` assuming you're actually using bash, and then those functions will be in your current environment
