[23:30:10] <kreyren[m]> I know about it, but i can't find sufficient replacement for Assassin's Creed, HITMAN, Dishonored, Witcher, Sherlock Holmes, LeagueOfLegends/DotA2, Terraria, JustCause, etc..
[23:31:03] <Bronzu> Ah yes, the big games.
[23:31:12] <Bronzu> It will be hard unfortunately...
[23:31:40] <kreyren[m]> Not big games per say rather their unique mechanics
[23:32:05] <kreyren[m]> e.g. i am fan of Assassin's Creed bcs i love stealth games and they allow me to climb walls and be creative in stealth
[23:32:16] <Bronzu> Well out of all of these I'm most familiar with terraria having a few hundred hours poured into it.

[23:33:43] <kreyren[m]> I play terraria to challenge myself and force myself to think of new strategies on Hardcore x Master Mode x For The Worthy 
[23:34:24] <kreyren[m]> (character death = lost of the character and the world, all bosses are stronger and the world is significantly more difficult)
[23:34:27] <Bronzu> Daaamn bro, didn't know you had infinite time at your disposal. Cause that sounds like suicide
[23:35:01] <Bronzu> Hardcore with Master mode is bad enough but no, you had to go a step further
[23:35:01] <kreyren[m]> i don't i just play games to relax from coding and stuff 
[23:35:20] <kreyren[m]> it's very rewarding and satisfying when you find new ways to progress in that
[23:35:44] <kreyren[m]> you should try! :p
[23:35:47] <Bronzu> Oh it is, but you hate it when that Jungle slime knocks you off to die of fall damage.
[23:36:04] <Bronzu> And don't get me started on the spiked ones
[23:36:21] <Bronzu> Now I realise how difficult it would be to create a libre terraria clone
[23:36:22] <kreyren[m]> nothing compared to a yelly fish that glitches through the blocks and gives you IK bcs you only can have 180HP otherwise eye will spawn
[23:36:26] <Bronzu> There is just so much stuff.
[23:36:45] <Bronzu> @kreyren[m], ikr
[23:36:46] <kreyren[m]> it woudn't be difficult.. rather needed a lot of  love

[23:38:05] <Bronzu> Oh no no no, it's much more than that
[23:38:09] <kreyren[m]> Godot has already like everything needed in a demo project for that
[23:38:16] <Bronzu> Subtle things like momentum are something to take into account too
[23:38:26] <Bronzu> Weapon handling
[23:38:28] <Bronzu> Boss AI
[23:38:46] <kreyren[m]> tru, but the most challenging is optimization to fit under performance budget and godot engine already handles that part 
[23:38:57] <kreyren[m]> BOSS AI is not difficult in terraria.. quite primitive actually
[23:39:06] <Bronzu> Nah man, I would probably do it in the same framework
[23:39:07] <Bronzu> FNA
[23:39:11] <kreyren[m]> just set speed set to follow player at random intervals with set speeds
[23:39:35] <kreyren[m]> animations take more time though
[23:39:41] <Bronzu> and assets
[23:39:53] <Bronzu> also
[23:39:53] * kreyren[m] would like to see FSF pushing for more cool libre games like mindustry 
[23:39:55] <Bronzu> Hoiks
[23:40:09] <Bronzu> Hoiks are really cool, but I don't know how they work
[23:40:24] * kreyren[m] doesn't know what hoiks are
[23:40:27] <Bronzu> So implementing a faithful collision engine also come into account
[23:40:32] <Bronzu> https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/Hoik
[23:40:49] <Bronzu> A device utilisng a glitch in collision allowing you to move entities at huge speeds
[23:40:50] <kreyren[m]> thus me mentioning godot that does that already
[23:41:03] <kreyren[m]> o.o
[23:41:07] <Bronzu> And godot has different colission programming compared to terraria
[23:41:14] <Bronzu> That's why I would rather use FNA
[23:41:42] <kreyren[m]> i guess didn't look that far into it
[23:42:01] <kreyren[m]> would still argue that there is a lack of resources for FLOSS developers to make FLOSS games
[23:42:03] <Bronzu> Terraria is a very complex game, I know much of it, but I'm not a huge nerd about it.
[23:42:10] <Bronzu> kreyren[m], not really
[23:42:15] <Bronzu> It's just like making a regular game
[23:42:21] <Bronzu> Only taking other things into account
[23:43:07] <Bronzu> Wait is the Microsoft Public License FSD and GPL compliant?
[23:43:11] <kreyren[m]> yes but majority of FLOSS game development halts at early stages or the game is too rushed due to the lack of resources with few exceptions like DOOM, Wolfenstain and mindustry
[23:43:20] <kreyren[m]> which have robust economy in place
[23:43:37] <Bronzu> Well Doom was a proprietary game at one point
[23:43:47] <Bronzu> And due to it being revolutionary it was very popular
[23:43:56] <kreyren[m]> or SuperTuxKart that have very limited resources, but lot of contributors and it's there for a long time
[23:43:58] <seabass_> > * <@kreyren:tchncs.de> would like to see FSF pushing for more cool libre games like mindustry
[23:43:58] <seabass_> Mindustry is awesome
[23:44:05] <Bronzu> Also Carmack liked Free Software (or Open Source can't remember)
[23:44:19] <Bronzu> So it was really the most favorable situation for the game
[23:44:33] * Bronzu needs to check out what Mindustry even is
[23:45:06] <seabass_> the term open source hadn't been coined at the time that DOOM was GPLed
[23:45:10] <kreyren[m]> still it's not difficult to make a sh@@!%^^ ton of money from a FLOSS game.. it's just not something that people do that often seemingly due to the lack of know-how to establish economy to finance the development
[23:45:21] *** Joins: mulin-c (~mulin-c@131.221.208.62)
[23:45:45] <seabass_> the truth is that it's hard to finance making a game, be it proprietary or open source or anything
[23:46:18] <seabass_> some great free software has been effectively funded, but it's hard to fund something that doesn't have a 'use'
[23:46:42] <seabass_> > * <@Bronzu:libera.chat> needs to check out what Mindustry even is
[23:46:42] <seabass_> join #libregamenight if you'd like to find out ;)
[23:46:45] * kreyren[m] would like to see FSF having a fund to support development of FLOSS games
[23:46:59] <Bronzu> joined
[23:47:29] <kreyren[m]> mindustry is basically cool tower defense game
[23:47:32] <Bronzu> ok ok, let me get this straight
[23:47:35] <Bronzu> Mindustry
[23:47:37] <Bronzu> Is factorio
[23:47:40] <Bronzu> But free?
[23:47:41] <Bronzu> Yes?
[23:47:43] <seabass_> yes, but free!
[23:47:54] <Bronzu> Oh hell yeah!
[23:47:55] <kreyren[m]> nah you don't make... factories...
[23:47:56] <seabass_> and better, I think, because it's free and you can make your own mods and patches
[23:47:57] <kreyren[m]> yes
[23:47:57] <kreyren[m]> lol
[23:48:08] <Bronzu> Now this is what I'm talking about
[23:48:18] <seabass_> you are good at Factorio?
[23:48:27] * kreyren[m] didn't realize the similarities with factorio 
[23:48:38] <Bronzu> No :D
[23:48:45] <seabass_> I learnt about Mindustry before I had heard of Factorio
[23:48:49] <seabass_> Bronzu: haha ;D
[23:48:53] <Bronzu> I wanted factorio, but now I have something better
[23:49:00] <Bronzu> A free alternative
[23:49:03] <Bronzu> But there is one issue.
[23:49:10] <kreyren[m]> i like how many mods mindustry has
[23:49:11] <Bronzu> It's not in the OpenBSD ports tree
[23:49:13] <kreyren[m]> Bronzu: JAVA!

[23:49:36] <Bronzu> Well I hate programming in java, but I have to thank it this time lol
[23:49:42] <kreyren[m]> i wish we could ban that thing from FLOSS
[23:49:49] <Bronzu> Bless you write once run everywhere lol
[23:49:50] <kreyren[m]> just declare everything that is JAVA as proprietary
[23:49:56] <Bronzu> ^^^
[23:50:23] * kreyren[m] is pretty sure that he developed PTSD from having to work with java
[23:50:23] <Bronzu> If I were to write a game it would have to be in C and SDL
[23:50:43] * Bronzu never really wrote java but still hates it
[23:51:20] <seabass_> kreyren[m]: noooo it's lovely
[23:51:24] * kreyren[m] also just took 4500 CZK from his Bf's wallet to play games on stadia that he surprisingly likes the integration of while hating it being proprietary and hating himself from not having the will power to connect the two pipes together to have working water cooling on his system
[23:52:14] <seabass_> don't feel bad about it kreyen
