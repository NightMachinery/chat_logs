[02:03:22] <OsKaR31415> so
[02:03:29] <OsKaR31415> python does not have outer product
[02:03:45] <OsKaR31415> the main idea of outer product is a generalisation of matrix product
[02:03:57] <OsKaR31415> *sorry
[02:04:07] <OsKaR31415> (that was inner product)
[02:04:38] <OsKaR31415> so outer product is basically a meta-operator, that takes an operator and allows you to create a table for that operator
[02:04:53] <rapier> awesomeeeee
[02:05:09] <OsKaR31415> e.g.: in APL, you have × that is the multiplication
[02:05:31] <OsKaR31415> the ∘. is the 2-symbols for the outer product
[02:05:38] <rapier> i see
[02:05:42] <OsKaR31415> so ∘.× is the outer product of multiplication
[02:06:08] <OsKaR31415> then ⍳5 is basically range(1, 5+1)

[03:56:56] <Yhg1s> Okay, well, I don't know anything that uses PYTHON, and I imagine it would be a path to the executable. That setting of PYTHONPATH is unlikely to cause this particular problem, since that appears to be Python 3.6. But don't set it.

[04:38:22] <Yhg1s> df00z: no, they're restricted because they need to be expressions (otherwise they would not be different from 'def' at all), and that means they can only contain expressions.

But really if you want people to be able to `import whisper` when they install it, putting an __init__.py in src/whisper/ will be the best, and most robust mechanism to do that

[05:31:02] <bjs> jiffe: I'm not sure where the namespace packages are coming here,  the way you describe doesn't sound like it should work.  Your whisper/bin and your *other* (original) whisper/  packages clash

[07:56:34] <clueful> I've been able to dynamically find all the classes, it seems like I should be able to get them into the namespace of the module some how I just don't understand the structure well enough to understand how to do it
[07:57:17] <clueful> like is there a dynamic version of import x.y as y, equivalent to import_module?

[08:06:07] <SnoopJ> clueful, you could do `globals()["y"] = getattr(x, "y")`, but that's starting to look pretty magical. What's this for?
[08:07:09] <SnoopJ> there's also module-level __getattr__() since 3.7+ but that's even more magical, heh. https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0562/

[08:10:19] <clueful> they are basically plugins, so I'd like it to be dynamic
[08:11:10] <jinsun> module level getattr looks less ugly than globals() manipulation, even if more magical
[08:12:40] <SnoopJ> jinsun, I think it actually doesn't solve this problem, because module-level getattr here would only be able to import at request time
[08:12:51] <SnoopJ> but I'm inclined to agree, a module is "just" an object after all :)

[08:21:01] <willow> it might be useful to be able to have a checksum or some other value to represent the tree so that i would know when to stop pruning
[08:21:02] <SnoopJ> if you just need the diff and the tree isn't unreasonable to hold in memory, pathlib.Path could be bent to do this

[11:00:01] <RoyK> hm... I'm on macOS 12.1 and I've installed Python from brew. It seems I have python 3.10 installed, but no 'requests' library there. I can't find python3.10 either, nor pip3.10, but starting ipython, tells me it's 31.0. Starting python3, start 3.9.9. Any ideas how to fix this?
[11:00:24] <RoyK> or perhaps how to just run ipython with 3.9

[13:47:30] <magga> okay thanks
[13:47:44] <bmr> for example, if you want to remove or copy all files in a UNIX:y system, you put the flag -r for recursive, which manipulates / affects all files and / or objects from that path traversing downward.
[13:47:49] <bmr> same for chmod et. al.
[13:47:56] <magga> alright :)
[13:48:03] <magga> lets say i wanted to compare two files in python

[13:51:05] <magga> hehe, my apologies... i am a little energic today, thinking out loudly! i think im gonna be able to figure it out now :) the word recursive is also getting processed to be stored in the long-time memory in my brain :)))

[18:05:50] <linearbit> pytorch has a numpy like api
[18:05:50] <rapier> it would be nice
[18:06:01] <rapier> ok, thank you very much
[18:06:04] <linearbit> all you need to do is use the cuda() functions to send matrices/tensors to the GPU
[18:06:18] <rapier> i'm so sorry i wasn't familiarized with torch term
[18:06:20] <linearbit> by default it will use the CPU
[18:06:25] <linearbit> it's a library
[18:06:34] <rapier> ok
[18:06:34] <grawity> hmm wondering, is the @ operator widely adopted? (are modules using it for non-matrix purposes?)
[18:06:38] <grym> our machines might be different, but also: some of the oldest computer programs ever written were to do linear algebra problems quickly, and numpy uses that lineage of code
[18:06:46] <linearbit> grawity, both numpy and torch use it - so yes
[18:06:56] <linearbit> Not sure about non-matrix purposes
[18:07:00] <grym> hah, my matmul test is still running :D
[18:07:04] <grym> i should try this with torch next
[18:07:08] <linearbit> but tbh it's probably not a great idea to do something unexpected with an operator

[18:45:15] <bjs> ianliu: i see, why the aio (async) variant?
[18:46:09] <ianliu> because aiobotocore is one of the dependencies to dask_cloudprovider already, and when I try to install boto3, it fails to resolve versions

[18:51:23] <ianliu> hmm, yea, maybe I can use botocore directly. Didn't occur to me

[18:53:27] <bjs> ianliu: maybe it's worth spending 10 minutes trying to figure out why there's a dependency issue installing boto3
[18:53:35] <bjs> is it that aiobotocore and boto3 are incompatible? that seems odd
[18:54:04] <pycode1> i have numpy array and then i need to check if the returned parameters are ok or not so the question is, should i create N test as the number of the parameter it returns OR one big test with many asserts inside ?
[18:54:05] <grym> pycode1: and then if you like, you can also pass in pathological ndarrays in a seperate test and assert how your function fails :)
[18:54:15] <pycode1> grym, yes
[18:54:18] <pycode1> ok
[18:54:19] <grym> pycode1: one big test with multiple asserts is fine
[18:54:23] <pycode1> ok
[18:54:25] <pycode1> thanks!
[18:54:39] <ianliu> aiobotocore depends on a very particular version of botocore, and when pip tries to fetch a boto3 for that specific version of botocore, that boto3 brings another dependency which conflicts with some other
[18:54:41] <grym> if your method returns a dict, assert that each key is what you think it is and that each key exists, etc; depending on how you know the function works

[20:33:40] <pro> hi, what are some options to export a simple dictionary (example. priceOfToys["tractor"] = 25.5) into a file, so that regular joe may view the file? I'm thinking json, or csv, but is there anything else?
[20:34:09] <rendar> nedbat, hi, happy new 2022

[20:34:28] <mefistofeles> pro: well, the short answer is yes
[20:34:35] <linearbit> pro, json would be the most straight-forward but there are also pickle and shelf for more complex objects
[20:34:57] <mefistofeles> it depends on what you are looking for, as linearbit suggests
[20:34:58] <pro> I'm looking for something minimal like tractor = 25.5
[20:34:59] <nedbat> rendar: you too
[20:35:16] *** Joins: fikran (~fikran@user/fikran)
[20:35:27] <nedbat> pro: how will regular joe be using the file?
[20:35:32] <linearbit> If you have a complex object which you want to serialize to json you can use a package like marshmallow or desert to create serialization schemes fairly easily
[20:35:43] <pro> with notepad, or catting it
[20:35:59] <linearbit> but yeah for minimal things with basic data types I'd recommend json
[20:35:59] <pro> so no fancy import into excel...
[20:35:59] <mefistofeles> I'd suggest TOML or even INI
[20:36:03] <nedbat> pro: then I would write my own three-line loop to write to the file in the format you just showed.
[20:36:13] <mefistofeles> nedbat: or that yes
[20:36:35] <linearbit> mefistofeles, those are options too but not as universally supported
[20:36:38] <pro> isnt toml like overkill ?
[20:36:55] <nedbat> linearbit: did you see pro's description of how it will be used?
[20:37:25] <pro> yeah, but writing my own stuff is kind of hard, because I won't think about "need to import it in the future"
[20:37:31] <grym> pro: you will
[20:37:34] <pro> so if I use TOML or INI, then I'm covered
[20:37:42] <grym> csv is probably what i'd reach for here, even with all its caveats
[20:38:05] <linearbit> Honestly I think some parts of TOML will be harder to understand than json or even xml
[20:38:16] <nedbat> pro: why would you need to import it in the future? Or if you do need to import it, why would you forget to?
[20:38:18] <grym> pro: how is joe user going to use this file
[20:38:48] <pro> grym: open it in notepad, ctrl+f something, done
[20:39:44] <grym> pro: yeah i'd `for k,v in mydict.items(): print(f'{k} = {v}', file=f)` and be done with it

[20:40:31] <linearbit> yeah I guess if there's 0 chance they'll ever want to use it in any program that would be good enough
[20:41:05] <pro> yup csv makes the most sense
[20:41:17] <linearbit> csv can be weird if you have strings with commas
[20:41:25] <grym> linearbit: if you use csv.writer, it's ok

[20:54:37] <Guest88> not str

[23:08:13] <teut> thats not a python question
[23:08:25] <teut> and is quite easy with material ui and react
[23:08:49] <ChrisWarrick> it might be a python question
[23:08:57] <ChrisWarrick> but I would recommend using the system image viewer or such
[23:08:57] <teut> or are you using tkinter?
[23:09:00] <twainwek> i should have clarified: i want to do it in python
[23:09:16] <teut> ok, so it is then a python ques, sorry
[23:09:17] <twainwek> i'm looking at tkinter right now, but wasn't sure if it was the right path for my usecase

[23:09:41] <ChrisWarrick> tkinter is a pretty terrible gui library

[23:11:59] *** Joins: Linux77 (~LinuMage@186.233.183.58)
[23:12:14] <ChrisWarrick> pyside is the best choice
[23:12:21] <teut> if its gui, no one can beat the browser
[23:12:25] <teut> or c#
[23:12:31] <ChrisWarrick> why C#?
[23:12:32] <han-solo> what ? :)
[23:12:44] <teut> C# has xamarin
[23:12:53] <ChrisWarrick> twainwek: qt has an image viewer sample, here’s a pyqt5 conversion: https://gist.github.com/acbetter/32c575803ec361c3e82064e60db4e3e0
[23:12:59] <ChrisWarrick> teut: how many apps actually use it?
[23:13:02] <lorogue> I was looking into tkinter for a simple gui for a script I write, why I am asking xD
[23:13:26] <lorogue> have written*
[23:13:30] <teut> not sure about xamarin but surely all windows apps use C#
[23:13:35] <teut> not Qt

[23:20:21] <jinsun> many gui stuff that I use on windows are written with Qt, though I think all of them are c++ and not python
[23:20:39] <ChrisWarrick> lorogue: if you want a GUI, look into pyside6. if you want a web thing, then flask might be it
