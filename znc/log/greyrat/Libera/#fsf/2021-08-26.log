[03:12:38] <kittyblam> specing: Lol, with how the devs seem if they could get away with that I am sure they would, but, I dobut they are doing that. There really needs to be a push for something like xmpp.
[03:13:13] <kittyblam> If you set it up right XMPP can be used to access basically anything from IRC, unlike matrix which can only access certain bridged ones.
[03:14:18] *** Joins: Gooberpatrol66 (~Gooberpat@user/gooberpatrol66)
[03:16:00] <kittyblam> yrk: Its not just about fancy features, a lot of the cool features on Matrix can be made in a less shit way. They didn't need to, for example, make an "official" client that is webshit. They didn't need to, for example, try to make everything one solid bloated spec instead of going modular (but with better defaults) like XMPP.
[03:17:34] <kittyblam> They don't need to strongarm people to use *their* servers by making the only "official" client suggest people to use only *their* servers, nor do they need to use their client to have subtle advertisements for their services.
[03:19:11] <specing> yeah, matrix focuses way too much on element
[03:20:16] <kittyblam> While this doesn't effect the end product itself directly, there is also some questionable things with their funding, not only are they earning more money than one would expect but they keep saying things like they are hiring UI whatevers but then show nothing of it, so, it just, really *feels* like something weird is going on with their money but I don't have any evidence and it doesn't necessarily directl
[03:20:16] <kittyblam> y effect the thing.
[03:20:30] <kittyblam> specing: Yeah, I honestly think that is by design and not coincidence
[03:20:44] <kittyblam> the devs are kinda agressive about making *their* things the only thing
[03:21:28] <kittyblam> like, a fork of Element popped up that had instant messager styled bubbles for the messages, something that element itself simply doesn't need
[03:22:09] *** Joins: Xenguy (~Xenguy@devuan/developer/Xenguy)
[03:22:50] <opal> >unlike matrix which can only access certain bridged ones.
[03:22:51] <kittyblam> so they immediately started having massive discussing about implementing that on PMs but not proper multi-person rooms, so that large rooms would look like discord and PMs would look like an instant messager, something that nobody wants (Not sure if the idea getting thrown around ever happened or will happen) and seems to have only been done to try to stomp out forks
[03:22:58] <opal> you can set up a personal bridge to join whatever you want im pretty sure
[03:23:45] <opal> but matrix definitely suffers from supernode syndrome
[03:24:11] <kittyblam> yeah I am sure there is ways to do that, but, by default the experience of the average user will be just libera.chat and a few others
[03:24:15] <opal> conversations for android tried to hybridise group chats and mucs poorly
[03:24:26] <opal> it opens up abuse from contacts who enjoy inviting people to their shitty mucs
[03:24:35] <kittyblam> the lesser known ones if they are even a thing break a lot, unlike something like XMPP which *so far* seems to be possible to make connect to any IRC server without fighting at all
[03:25:41] <opal> i dont like bridge
[03:25:43] <opal> bridges*
[03:25:53] <opal> kinda getting lazy pushing the keys on my keyboard right now lol
[03:26:57] <kittyblam> yeah
[03:26:58] <opal> ive put it off for a while but i was beginning work on a multi-platform chat client
[03:27:09] <opal> multi-protocol may be more precise wording
[03:27:16] <opal> i only develop for posix
[03:27:22] <kittyblam> oh? neat uwu, there needs to be more investment into that type of stuff tbh
[03:27:28] <kittyblam> investment of time*
[03:27:32] <opal> yeah

[03:30:26] <kittyblam> ye, multi-protocol from one client should be a thing to be strived for more in general than it currently is
[03:30:42] <kittyblam> like, where is a GUI or web frontend for both Invidioua and Peertube, for example?
[03:30:48] <kittyblam> Invidious*
[03:31:50] <opal> im against web frontends personally
[03:32:15] <opal> i use invidious just for search really
[03:32:19] <scara> Then what do you use?
[03:32:33] <kittyblam> same, although, with something like invidious it can at least be done without javascript ect. and sometimes I use it to spawn in mpv although I am gradually starting to use ytfzf more lol
[03:32:36] <opal> why does being "against" something imply i have a ready alternative?
[03:32:37] <scara> Sadly everything is like a webapp...

[03:33:30] <opal> well in the future if i bitch about anything, its probably because i dont have something i replaced it with
[03:33:39] <kittyblam> Not everything is a webapp, I just have javascript ect disabled by default because there is pretty much a dedicated program for everything

[03:34:19] <scara> I've even seen games run in browsers
[03:34:22] <opal> i use a mail client, i use xmpp and telegram for IM, irc for large channels like this that decided to stay on irc, mobile apps for matrix that i barely even check
[03:34:30] <opal> i play agar.io in a web browser
[03:34:36] <opal> i want to write an opengl client for it though
[03:34:53] <opal> theres already foss clients/servers around agario so its possible to run a fully-foss service for that
[03:35:11] <opal> but the server everyone uses is not 100% faithful to the original's physics
[03:35:12] <opal> which puts me off
[03:35:13] <scara> Is that the game with the circles, right?
[03:35:16] <opal> ya
[03:35:28] <kittyblam> I just use an XMPP client to connect to IRC and XMPP, and have dedicated clients for everything else, mostly play Minetest modpacks and DCSS as games.
[03:35:30] <opal> casual play its fine to have those differences but ive been playing for like 5 years
[03:35:37] <opal> if something feels off i notice it
[03:35:52] <opal> and it screws with my strategy
[03:36:10] <opal> hoping for a fully-foss minecraft stack too, ive seen clients and servers for that in varying degrees of development
[03:36:18] <opal> cuberite for server, some people have worked on clients
[03:36:30] <opal> theres still the authentication to worry about but luckily servers can run in offline/"cracked" mode
[03:36:33] <kittyblam> minetest is really great
[03:36:42] <scara> I like the idea of XMPP but it is also a little annoying that it wouldn't really work with weechat. doesn't it also require a dedicated domain?
[03:36:44] <opal> i dont like it much
[03:36:57] <opal> performance is great, design decisions not that much
[03:36:57] <kittyblam> its GUI could use some work but it has gems like Mineclone and Nodecore
[03:37:02] <opal> being capped to 65k^3 map limit is stupid
[03:37:06] <opal> sqlite storage for worlds is stupid
[03:37:24] <opal> "oh why would you need a map bigger than 65k^3"
[03:37:29] <opal> ask literally the entire anarchy minecraft community
[03:37:34] <kittyblam> yeah, but, its not proprietary and it works.
[03:37:34] <opal> people refuse to build bases less than 100k out
[03:37:47] <opal> see i dont settle for that
[03:37:49] <kittyblam> Lol yeah, I haven't run into that issue but that probably needs to be fixed, they are in a unique
[03:38:05] <opal> yeah the world format needs to be rethought entirely
[03:38:11] <kittyblam> position to do something more like minecraft cubic chunks mod, where you could just have it endless in every direction by default, giving it an adventage in that regards to minecraft.
[03:38:15] <opal> yeah
[03:38:19] <scara> kittyblam: mineclone is kinda slow when you don't have meany resources to deal with like on a small half gig vps or old laptop
[03:38:42] <kittyblam> Mineclone works well enough on a pinebook pro, so performance is actually quite good
[03:38:46] <opal> another thing with anarchy minecraft is theyre all balls-deep into the minecraft meta
[03:38:53] <opal> so again thats where inconsistencies glare
[03:39:03] <opal> "oh this dupe / this redstone setup doesnt work here? wtf"
[03:39:26] <scara> I like my redstone!
[03:39:27] <opal> does mineclone have carpet/rail or tnt duping :>
[03:39:33] <kittyblam> I don't think thats something minetest needs to worry about, although, mineclone might
[03:39:36] <opal> i havent tested mineclone in a while
[03:39:52] <opal> well like i said theres cuberite which i think is currently locked to 1.12 parity or something
[03:39:55] <kittyblam> I like things like nodecore that try to take everything in a different direction entirely from minecraft
[03:39:57] <scara> I need my glitches, I like to click in a corner and boom secret base!
[03:40:04] <opal> its one of those things i'd love to hack on but dont have time
[03:40:21] <opal> scara playing the meta is just my playstyle for a lot of games lol
[03:40:28] <opal> im really into speedrunning
[03:40:43] <opal> video game cheats/hacks back a decade ago pretty much got me into programming
[03:40:44] <scara> meta?
[03:40:51] <kittyblam> become a mineclone or nodecore speedrunner, use whatever unique glitches minetest probably has
[03:40:58] <opal> the metagame
[03:41:04] <scara> I do not understand
[03:41:35] <opal> you arent playing e.g. minecraft, youre analysing how it works and doing whatever you can within the possibilities of the engine
[03:41:48] <scara> Ok
[03:41:59] <opal> look into speedrunning too if you havent
[03:42:13] <opal> people find glitches in all sorts of games and use those as strategies to get faster times
[03:42:33] <opal> you arent limited to what the game tells you to do but instead the full potential of what the game *can* do
[03:42:34] <scara> I like to go on some servers and get out of the map or like super high up, can use block glitches and lag to achive it!
[03:42:43] <kittyblam> I'm not too into speedrunning but bruh speedrunning minetest games sounds fun
[03:42:55] <opal> kittyblam i never bought into the minecraft speedrunning craze lol
[03:43:04] <opal> sure the runs are interesting but like
[03:43:15] <opal> lot of rng in that game, lot of version differences
[03:43:21] <opal> would be even weirder with minetest
[03:43:23] <scara> I have seen mario speed run video thing where thay shave off like a few game loops by pressing a combination of bottons really quick
[03:43:36] <opal> not saying it cant/shouldnt be done, just not that i'll do it
[03:43:38] <kittyblam> if there isn't one already minetest needs a roguelike, speedrunning a minetest roguelike would be fun
[03:44:06] <opal> story-based games on voxel engines seem nice yeah

[08:54:49] <lts> I'm mostly pointing to the clear error in the first paragraph: "Linus Torvalds, a Finnish-American software engineer, released the Linux kernel and the second version of the GNU General Public License (GPLv2)." Spotted this from a local (online) newspaper using this link as source and thanking Linus for both Linux and GPLv2.

[14:52:03] <lousiF> hi
[14:52:42] <kompowiec> hey
[14:52:46] <DiffieHellman> Hi
[14:55:33] <eglvoland> testing free gnu+linux distros, parabola was too hard for me to install
[14:56:25] *** Joins: harish__ (~harish@158.140.144.42)
[14:57:26] <DiffieHellman> Well, I would recommend Gentoo GNU/Linux (the real version with nothing proprietary), but it looks like you can't install it without (parts of) systemd any more.
[14:57:51] <eglvoland> what are the differences between systemd and openrc?
[14:59:15] <DiffieHellman> OpenRC is a lot smaller and is actually an init system. systemd is very large and is scope creep the software and is not longer just an init system
[15:00:26] <eglvoland> so is the fact that systemd is heavy the reason why people don't like systemd ?
[15:02:07] <DiffieHellman> The fact that you have to fight very hard not to  have systemd pushed on you is why people don't like systemd.
[15:03:16] <DiffieHellman> Also, systemd somehow manages to cause everything to break when it's forced onto people as well.
[15:06:37] <DiffieHellman> One example is one of my computers - suspend to RAM works just fine if you write "mem" to /sys/power/state, and consolekit2 was doing that just fine. Then the Gentoo maintainers decided to replace that with elogind (logind extracted from systemd, except on compile, it pulls in the whole systemd and statically compiles against parts). On update, bam suspend no longer operates somehow - you just get a
[15:06:39] <DiffieHellman> blackscreen on resume.
[15:07:56] <DiffieHellman> *suspend initiated with elogind, but echo mem > /sys/power/state still works just fine

[16:48:09] <opal> oh thats what you nitpick
[16:48:19] <Anedroid> > Gentoo includes installation recipes for a number of nonfree programs in its primary package system.
[16:48:23] <opal> gentoo doesnt even necessitate the use of gnu userland

[16:48:59] <opal> no its gentoo plus linux
