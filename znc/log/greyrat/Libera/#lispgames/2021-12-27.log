[10:45:09] <winning-luser> Are there any 3D CL libraries ready for use? Not asking for a fullblown engine but something higher level than directly working with opengl? If not that's ok but thought I'd ask in case I've missed something.
[10:48:06] <borodust> winning-luser: CEPL
[10:52:12] <winning-luser> borodust: I guess I should be a bit more specific: Something higher level than OpenGL overall. Maybe at that point that does turn to the "engine" territory?
[10:52:26] <winning-luser> I'm just trying to get away with not having to learn OpenGL ;)
[11:08:57] <borodust> well, abstracting away from opengl completely is more in a rendering engine territory, yes
[11:09:37] <borodust> winning-luser: i don't think there is anything ready in CL land
[11:09:51] <borodust> most stuff is wip
[11:10:01] <winning-luser> perfectly fair
[11:10:52] <winning-luser> I wanna make games but not fall into the timesink of making a game engine, so choices have to be made. practicality and all that jazz
[11:27:10] <borodust> winning-luser: absolutely
