[00:03:52] <[Coke]> ah, the MoarVM Makefile, not rakudo. Still, don't see a -latomic_ops in mine.

[00:04:21] <MasterDuke> moarvm uses libatomic_ops, i suspect you need to install the libatomic-ops-dev debian package
[00:04:43] <[Coke]> Shouldn't the package require it automagically?
[00:04:48] <frank67> Sorry I accidentally left the channel
[00:04:52] <[Coke]> (if it's going to die this way?)
[00:04:59] <[Coke]> and changed your ID. :)
[00:05:33] <MasterDuke> but i think it's only because building his module requires compiling some c code
[00:07:20] <MasterDuke> frank67: if you missed my earlier comment, "moarvm uses libatomic_ops, i suspect you need to install the libatomic-ops-dev debian package"
[00:07:46] <frank67> Yes indeed¬† libatomic-ops-dev solved that. I think I did not find that package, as I searched for atomic_ops ,not atomic-ops.

[00:10:01] <frank67> So is this a bug somewhere? My code does not use atomic_ops. Or should I update the readme to give a hint that this package might be required?
[00:11:44] <MasterDuke> fyi, if you build your own rakudo, moarvm recently gained the ability to use c11's atomic ops instead (assuming you have a supported OS+compiler), so you could pass `--moar-option='--c11-atomics'` to the rakudo Configure.pl call
[00:13:40] *** Joins: Zgredu[m] (~zgredumat@2001:470:69fc:105::e39f)
[00:18:46] <frank67> I am still uncertain: how should I document the build procedure of my code, so that someone else could succeed building it? Does the native call machine require atomic_ops to be linked against the parts of the code I provided?
[00:20:11] <ugexe> for a debian package you probably shouldnt be running e.g. Build.pm
[00:21:29] <MasterDuke> i think he's saying he got his rakudo from a debian package, but is installing his module with zef
[00:22:10] <frank67> Yes exactly.
[00:22:27] <ugexe> if you can make it work without LibraryMake maybe try that
[00:24:55] <ugexe> or delete whatever entries from https://github.com/soundart/perl6-tweetnacl/blob/8bcf5477a6f445a0abb3f2ee3f77fb65c5561a12/Build.pm#L9 you dont want
[00:30:07] <frank67> I think this is quite hard, especially if there are variants like¬† `--moar-option='--c11-atomics'` around.

[20:51:41] <tbrowder> cro question (also asked on #cro): can anyone explain how to create a systemd setup to manage the cro app?
[20:54:14] *** Quits: mexen (uid495612@user/mexen) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[20:54:24] <moritz> `cro run` runs in the foreground, yes?
[20:55:41] <moritz> then in the [Services] section, you can just write ExecStart=/path/to/your/cro run
[20:56:58] <moritz> possibly configure working directory and some environment variables
[20:59:09] <moritz> WorkingDirectory= and Environment=
[20:59:48] <moritz> or to start from the basics: you must write a systemd unit file (with the directives I've mentioned above)
[21:00:37] *** Quits: jjido (~Denis@94.4.149.217) (Quit: My MacBook Air has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz‚Ä¶)
[21:01:25] <moritz> then you can either start them as the current user (systemctl --user start ...), or install them system wide by putting them into /etc/systemd/system/; then you need to run `systemctl daemon-reload` to the make sure systemd looks for new unit files
[21:02:08] <moritz> ... and then you can run something like `systemctl start your-service` to start it, and with `systemctl enable ...` you can have it started automatically
[21:02:26] <moritz> tbrowder: ^^ does that help?
[21:03:48] <guifa> ah moritz is around!

[22:53:58] <leont> I added some L<>, but they don't appear to work
[22:55:13] <leont> E.g. https://raku.land/cpan:LEONT/Protocol::MQTT
[22:56:40] <leont> Like, you probably want either Protocol::MQTT::Client or Net::MQTT, but there's no way to send a user to either of those documentation pages
[23:35:44] <leont> Actually, is there any way to show more than one module in a dist at all? I have the impression none of our ecosystem sites support it
