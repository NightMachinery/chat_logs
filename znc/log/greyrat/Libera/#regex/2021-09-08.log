[00:56:57] <NiLon> also the !rehelp doesn't summon people, it's just informative command

[13:51:51] <Me-me> And to you, as well.
[13:52:01] <gnod> It seems [a-z]+? does not make the + non-greedy but makes the whole term optional. Could that be?
[13:52:20] <digitok> nope
[13:52:22] <Me-me> Non-greedy can sometimes look like optional. In this case it's giving a minimum of one.
[13:52:39] <gnod> So the + is still greedy?
[13:52:45] <Me-me> No.
[13:53:00] <Me-me> It's non-greedy as a result of the ?, unless you have the inversion modifier on.
[13:53:03] <digitok> it will match 1 or more, as few as possible
[13:53:35] <gnod> Strange. I have a case where this submatch matches an empty string: ([^\n]+?)
[13:53:57] <digitok> nah
[13:53:59] <Me-me> Are you sure it's not just matching a whitespace character (that isn't a newline)?
[13:54:01] <digitok> :p
[13:54:07] <gnod> No
[13:54:09] <digitok> it could match a carriage return

[13:54:31] <Me-me> Please do.
[13:54:40] <gnod> It is in a rather big regex applied to a rather big string.

[13:59:00] <gnod> Will slim it down further ...
[13:59:33] <gnod> Oh, the "|$" seems to behave different than I though.
[13:59:58] <gnod> https://www.online-python.com/GgBOzm2ujs
[14:00:25] <gnod> I thought it would match "c" or "$". But it seems to match "anything on the left" or "$"?
[14:00:36] <Me-me> If you put the | on the root level of the pattern, yes.
[14:00:42] <gnod> I see
[14:00:47] <gnod> Mistery solved.
[14:00:50] <gnod> Me-me: Thank you!

[23:43:41] <purplex> You don't want the line #3 to match?
[23:46:14] <mozgalom> In my example, I would like all the lines to match. Currently, only last 2 are not matching because "admin" appears before the other string, ofc
[23:46:52] <purplex> What about 50(?=.*admin).* ?
[23:51:00] <mozgalom> Oh I see, looks like that works yea
[23:51:24] <purplex> Don't you want the host part? 
[23:51:55] <purplex> Also, add a ^ before that regex.
[23:52:15] <mozgalom> I used the host part, wait let me save this, I have a question actually =)
[23:53:43] <mozgalom> Ok, so I did this https://regex101.com/r/nuOcen/3
[23:54:05] <mozgalom> And I would expect here to match all lines except those which have "febo" instead of "admin" in them
[23:54:56] <mozgalom> Am I misunderstanding this highlights in the UI or are all lines with "admin" (no matter the position) really matched, since in the first couple of lines "admin" string is not highlighted
