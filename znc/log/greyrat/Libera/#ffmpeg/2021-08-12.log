[00:25:36] <Harold58> Hello FFmpeg,
[00:33:09] <PocketKiller> hello
[00:33:56] <Harold58> I am interested in develop a software to capture H.264/RTSP including its audio. I have seen commands or programing lines in internet of FFMPEG Libraries,
[00:34:17] <Harold58>  but i´d like to known more about which are precise libraries to make this or if you know exactly the commands to make it would be ideal or the procedures developed and tested to make this capture
[00:34:40] <Harold58> thank you so much

[00:38:37] <mfwitten> By using the 'showinfo' filter, I've found that a 'format=yuv420p' filter MUCH later in the filter graph seems to be propagating that conversion back to previous filters. That doesn't seem right to me. Any ideas?
[00:38:37] *** Joins: drewa (~drew@user/drew)
[00:40:16] <mfwitten> 'zscale=...,showinfo,drawtext=...,format=yuv420p' reports that the format is "yuv420p", but if I remove the 'format=yuv420p', then 'showinfo' reports a different format.

[00:46:20] <mfwitten> Without the 'format=yuv420p', 'showinfo' reports the format is 'yuv444p10le'; I can achieve the "correct" behevior by doing something like this: 'format=yuv444p10le,format=yuv420p'; the first 'format' filter acts like a kind of barrier, I guess, keeping the second 'format' filter's pix_fmt from being propagated back. This seems like a bug.

[03:28:11] <kepstin> mfwitten: that propagation is intentional; ffmpeg tries to insert as few auto-conversion filters as possible, and most filters can only take matching formats on input and output
[03:28:53] <kepstin> so if your filter chain contains one filter that can do a particular conversion, then ffmpeg will do the conversion there rather than insert another filter later to convert
[03:29:19] <kepstin> the normal way to force a particular spot to be where a conversion happens is to manually insert a 'scale' filter
[03:30:27] <kepstin> when you do two format filters with different formats side by side, what's happening is that ffmpeg sees that the two format filters can't be connected together directly because they're incompatible, so it auto-inserts a scale filter between them.

[04:08:03] <mfwitten> kepstin: Intersting. Thanks for the explanation. Isn't there a worry that some algorithms will perform worse than anticipated if a certain format is propagated back like that?
[04:08:45] <mfwitten> kepstin: For instance, I've had trouble with cropping and overlaying when using a format with subsampling; the coordinates have to be even, etc.
[04:09:04] <mfwitten> kepstin: (which is to say, the filters silently alter the specified coordinates)
[04:09:24] <kepstin> if you need a specific format going through a specific filter, then you can place format and/or scale filters to ensure it's working the way you want. The debug output with "-v verbose" is helpful for determining where ffmpeg has decided to insert conversions.
[04:10:47] <kepstin> the defaults are to ensure that all filters are connected using formats they say they support, and auto-insert the minimum number of necessary conversions, since conversions are normally something you want to avoid.
[04:11:25] <mfwitten> kepstin: OK. Thanks. It's nice to be able to understand what's happening.

[04:50:48] <wyatt8740> not really sure where I should ask this, but I think there's a chance this place will have someone who knows. If an image is color corrected (with an ICC profile and something like Little CMS) and _then_ resampled, wouldn't the result differ from resampling and then correcting?
[04:52:03] <wyatt8740> I ask because I'm hacking on mcomix to add color correction and its current flow control means I could save a LOT of CPU cycles by applying correction transformations prior to resampling to fit (have to convert a GDK PixBuf back to a PIL image object , transform, and convert back again otherwise).
[05:00:28] <klaxa> sounds like it would differ to me, but i'm not familiar with the specifics. however, think of a simplified case where you have 1 pixel in grayscale and your output is binary. it could be a color that becomes white when resampled, but if you do color correction it becomes darker and thus becomes black after resampling after correction
[05:01:19] <klaxa> wait, with resampling you mean resizing?
