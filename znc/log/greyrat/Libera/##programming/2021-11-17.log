[00:37:27] <mr_ab> oldlaptop: that's exactly what I was about to clarify.  Anonymous functions, then, are literally that, a function with no name.  The "closure" is the function being bound with values from the immediate scope (sort of the polar opposite of a pure function in a weird way)?

[00:38:24] <oldlaptop> It's a weird enough way to be "the polar opposite" that it isn't at all incompatible with pure/stateless functions
[00:38:28] <apotheon> pyzozord: proud to be uncool
[00:38:35] <flakland> i quickly glanced at the wiki for "closure" looks like it can be as simple as a function pointer
[00:39:16] <oldlaptop> even in in wikipedia's python example(s), neither g() nor the anonymous function h() creates mutate anything
[00:39:33] <apotheon> I think you'd still need your function to be a first-class object that can be passed as a parameter.
[00:39:33] <pyzozord> however i truly don't see any advantage of php over python
[00:39:47] <pyzozord> python seems objectively superior in every way
[00:39:50] <mr_ab> I am not trying to start a flame war, but man, I'll be honest.  I've wrote php for like 15 years.  It was a pretty garbage language back in the 4.x days, ... but it honestly irks me on a daily basis everybody was just like "ok, let's just use javascript for everything, despite it's obvious flaws" 
[00:39:58] <oldlaptop> flakland: C does not have anonymous functions, "lambdas", or closures.
[00:40:12] <flakland> you can pass function types though
[00:40:23] <pyzozord> except maybe performance, I think php is much faster

[00:40:31] <mr_ab> php has a JIT now but it's wonky

[00:49:00] <apotheon> pyzozord: The community is important -- and also tends to feed back into design of the language over time.

[01:54:00] <ProfSimm> Hey folks I'm writing a language and trying to come up with clean syntax. One thing I wanna avoid is confusion between capitals and lowercase letters, etc. so I decided to use middot (interpunct) as word separator in identifiers. So your var names look·like·this. 
[01:54:08] <ProfSimm> What do you think
[01:54:11] <sonny> no
[01:54:16] <nomagno> sonny: because Autopilot spit tons of unique, copyrighted code in its test runs and even now

[01:54:50] <ProfSimm> Obviously there's no interpunct on the keyboard.
[01:54:53] <sonny> yes it is
[01:54:57] <ProfSimm> But that's what the IDE will show
[01:54:58] <nomagno> If it prints code that is character by character like a big fragment, it is not in question whether it has been fed that fragment

[02:00:17] <apotheon> Maybe, whenever copilot gives you three lines, it's an indication that you should create a library.
[02:00:29] <ProfSimm> dre, for example look at this declaration:  "public static function foo()"
[02:00:37] <ProfSimm> Not my syntax, but just an example

[02:00:49] <sonny> oldlaptop: do you say "quotes different" or just pronounce with emphasis lol
[02:00:57] <dre> ProfSimm, yes, but if spaces are part of the identifer, you could then also change meaning with other symbols

[05:42:59] <oldlaptop> Real randomness tends to require OS-specific code.
[05:43:07] <[itchyjunk]> there probably is a lot of random stuff
[05:43:14] <jeaye> Gamah: C++ has its own random utilities.

[05:45:47] <oldlaptop> https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/random/random_device would appear to be the closest thing to "real" randomness available in the STL still - I note that it's still specified such as to give the implementation an out if the OS does not provide the necessary support.

[08:22:43] <arahael> Hash: frankly, most of them will do fine.  most of them have various huge and small frameworks for web serving.
[08:23:02] <Hash> all I'm trying to do is serve static content, and only GET requests.
[08:23:28] <arahael> for production?  then just use nginx.
[08:23:35] <Hash> Just listen on 80, get a request, translate that to file, open file, send to client.
[08:23:41] <Hash> No to write a minimal one myself
[08:24:08] <arahael> i'd find some minimal framework then in your preferred language.
[08:25:37] <Jaydayal> Hash: your requirement sounds like a assignment/learning project... are you really going to pick any language? I guess you already will have practical constraints limiting the list. Pick one of them.
[08:26:29] <arahael> Hash: if you want to know what *i* would use, i'd probably look at something using warp in haskell.  but indoubt 
[08:26:39] <aoei\Chickatrice> yeah besides that just go with a lang you're already fairly comfy with
[08:26:41] <aoei\Chickatrice> imo
[08:26:56] <arahael> but i doubt you are already familiar with warp or haskell...  *definitely* pick what you are comfortable in.
[08:27:04] <aoei\Chickatrice> the task is simple enough that the best lang for it is... the lang you know best :P
[08:27:25] <arahael> cha-ching!

[09:37:18] <quazimodo> so here I am writing a bunch of tooling so that we can run our acceptance tests against the full stack
[09:37:45] <quazimodo> and i'm thinking ... should we just run our tests against a swim lane in parallel to staging
[09:38:01] <quazimodo> but then in saying it i've pissed myself off ... acceptance testing is a toughy
[09:38:40] <quazimodo> I don't see a way other than to set up a copy of everything I need for each consumer to run it's tests against, and probably all of that parallelised so that it's fast
[09:39:29] <quazimodo> atm i'm going for a docker-compose based stack including the databases, apis & consumers all on circleci
[09:39:42] <quazimodo> is anyone having a violent reaction to what i'm doing?

[14:02:30] <arahael> Yep, the 10.
[14:02:41] <merijn> Did you try adding 1-2 drops of water already?
[14:03:12] <arahael> I have.  Next time I should try without just to see what the difference is, but woah. It's different. Not even the same drink
[14:03:19] <merijn> :)
[14:03:43] <arahael> I was surprised at the alcohol content - I thought 40% was the max for whiskey.
[14:03:54] <merijn> 40% is the *minimum* for whisky
[14:04:07] <arahael> Then we have some seriously bad whiskys in Australia!
[14:04:12] <arahael> Pretty sure I've seen 38%'s.
[14:04:16] <merijn> wait, what?
[14:04:28] <merijn> Do you have some weird regulation on ABV percentages?
[14:04:42] <merijn> AFAIK you're not legally allowed to call it whisky below 40% in the EU
[14:04:44] <arahael> Don't think so, but...  We do have *insane* taxations w.r.t. spirits.
[14:05:32] <merijn> I just googled EU regulation, whisky is legally required to be at least 40% in the EU, yeah
[14:07:15] <arahael> I'll have to keep an eye out for the low percentage ones.
[14:07:21] <arahael> And will let you know :D
[14:07:36] <arahael> Really surprised at how smokey this is - it reminds me of the camp fire.
[14:07:39] <merijn> arahael: The Ardbeg 10 is actually kinda "sharp" in terms of taste, some of the others, like Uigeadail and Corryvreckan lose the sharpness and have more depth/nuance
[14:07:54] <merijn> Lots of the smoke, with some licorice-y flavours
[14:08:07] <arahael> I *definitely* need to get out and experiment mroe.
[14:08:32] <arahael> This was $110, btw.  Whiskey is seriously expensive here.
[14:08:37] <merijn> But with high taxes the Corryvreckan's price might be ridiculous, since it's cask strength (so something like 62% ABV)

[21:28:17] <CoderGuy> Alright I have an interesting problem. Lets say I have a list of Display Objects. so like 10 nested divs. What I want to achieve is if any of the divs change in width, their parent divs adjust to match the width of the child. Does this mean anytime I add a child div to my list, that I have to loop through ALL of the parent divs & update them?
[21:30:08] <kveroneau> Too bad we just can't attach events to divs to run code when it's dimensions change like we could do in Desktop programming. :(
[21:30:16] *** Joins: CodeMouse92 (~CodeMouse@user/codemouse92)
[21:30:44] <Decker> CoderGuy yes, if they have absolute or reltive postioning - otherwise divs are good at containing content
[21:31:20] <CoderGuy> Decker sooo do modern browsers do this? they loop through when content is updated & reset the widths of everything?
[21:31:29] *** Quits: cm007magnum (~Rheanna@61.171.38.68) (Remote host closed the connection)
[21:31:56] <CoderGuy> and there is no way to improve on the cost of a change, like everytime you add it has to loop through everything even if you know ultimately you're going to be adding like many elements?

[23:17:43] <ProfSimm> pyzozord, the prefrontal cortex "tires" very easily, it's very energy consuming

[23:34:38] <pyzozord> arent fft essentially linear algebra?
[23:34:41] <pyzozord> *ft
[23:35:12] <InPhase> Decker: This particular implementation is hard-coded to only work with power of 2 length inputs, which is usually sufficient and very optimal.  There are fancier implementations which will work for non power of 2 signal lengths.  If you can, you should generally stick to the powers of 2 to keep everything clean.
[23:35:17] <flakland> vandalism is the act of obfuscaation/minification that happens billions of times a day on the web to javascript files that are licensed with pushover licenses that allow this vandalism to take place.

[23:36:54] <apotheon> That doesn't make it less rude, but at least less harmful by not doing it to good code.
