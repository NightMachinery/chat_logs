[03:07:46] <arahael> vdamewood: Yeah, that looks logical.  So the north part is north of that border, and the south part is south of that! :D
[03:08:38] <arahael> I think many companies in australia will call them "The Americas", to avoid this confusion...
[03:08:41] <vdamewood> arahael: And also, to many 'America' on its own can refer to the country between Canada and Mexico, much to the chagrin of those in the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking portions of the continents.
[03:09:10] <vdamewood> And by 'many' I mean many in the US and outside the continents.

[03:48:29] <arahael> vdamewood: And I suspect that they first transport it to Australia, in my case, THEN charge, THEN "ship". Still not clear yet whether shipping it out constitutes "Delivery", or whether it's delivered once it's actually at my door.
[03:49:31] <arahael> They also think I'm being stupid and unreasonable for asking about what's happening with the order when I ask them on the 13th.

[03:53:15] <vdamewood> arahael: Well, with any luck when if finally arrives in Aus, it will be in Perth. :P
[03:54:16] <arahael> Worst point was when they had an automated bot asking me if the "ticket" had been resolved and I responded no, that I was still waiting for it to ship.  My response got entered into the ticket conversation, but the frigging bot's request that I was responding to didn't!! (and it didn't self-identify as a bot).

[08:56:24] <selkirk> MsSmith: the people who you're selling to, if they can read, would never buy from you.
[08:56:52] <rue_mohr> MsSmith, this sounds like a challange
[08:56:57] <rue_mohr> ... kat?
[08:57:08] <InPhase> More importantly almost all the people who would buy something in source code form have heard of github.  :)

[08:57:32] <MsSmith> the ones I could easily stick behind an API or something and hire freelancer graphic designers and marketers to make the icons
[08:58:13] <jkk> InPhase, btw what about - meeting different people instead only ones who 'think' same :)
[08:58:15] <MsSmith> maybe even considering ROI and cutting into a modest % of that to 'refactor'
[08:58:22] <MsSmith> to make it more marketable

[08:59:37] <InPhase> jkk: Not sure what you're talking about.  But I do get out into the blue room pretty regularly.
[09:01:26] <oldlaptop> MsSmith: The basic problem is that your competition has the same product, for free.

[09:07:30] <selkirk> MsSmith: i don't think you're even remotely familiar with the concept of licensing.
[09:08:07] <MsSmith> selkirk: why not? it'd just be 'copy left' lol
[09:08:19] <MsSmith> thatd be part of the fine print
[09:08:45] <jeaye> MIT isn't copyleft.
[09:09:00] <MsSmith> MIT would be even easier
[09:09:09] <selkirk> MsSmith: if the company who's buying you're stolen game knows that it has MIT license or GPL license, they won't pay you anything for it. and it's not fine print. it's bold print with underline.
[09:09:34] <MsSmith> selkirk its not stolen ?
[09:09:38] <MsSmith> it was licensed
[09:09:50] <MsSmith> you can do w/e you want with it including resell
[09:09:57] <MsSmith> that's the whole point
[09:09:59] <selkirk> MsSmith: it was licensed by the creator for you to copy it. the copyright doesn't change with you just copying it.
[09:10:58] <MsSmith> yea so whoever buys it would just have to respect the license
[09:11:04] <MsSmith> no biggie
[09:11:39] <MsSmith> maybe offer a bit of a discount with GPL or something
[09:12:54] <selkirk> MsSmith: with MIT, you can basically do whatever you want. with GPL, you can't close it even after modifying. but that's not relevant. it's not viable to be closed if a copy is already open in the wild. it's already free, you can't sell a recipe for hamburger, or air.
[09:12:54] <jeaye> You had the idea. The tough part is the execution.
[09:13:04] <MsSmith> youd be paying for customer service and shit. you could even offer graphic designers and teams to "help" you sell
[09:13:42] <selkirk> MsSmith: if you remove the copyright from the game which mentions who designed it, you're already committing a crime.
[09:13:51] <MsSmith> selkirk: I can sell a recipe for hamburger if someone is willing to buy it lol
[09:14:17] <MsSmith> no, the copyright would not be removed
[09:14:25] <selkirk> MsSmith: only a lunatic would buy it, just like with your game.
[09:14:32] <MsSmith> it'd be respected 100% that's the entire point. but youd have value adds like customer service
[09:14:37] <oldlaptop> "Paying for customer service" is generally what the customers of outfits like Red Hat are doing. The key point of course is that they are providing customer service.
[09:14:57] <selkirk> MsSmith: it's already free, he can just play it by downloading it from GitHub, what good are you?
[09:15:08] <MsSmith> selkirk: I can install it
[09:15:12] <MsSmith> host it
[09:15:16] <MsSmith> provide support
[09:15:20] <MsSmith> graphic designers etc
[09:15:28] <selkirk> MsSmith: it you host it as a multiplayer online game, that's something.
[09:15:37] <oldlaptop> There also (still) exist people who will sell you (say) Debian on 14 DVDs or whatever they're up to now. The key point of course is that they're selling a physical object that is for some narrow class of customers difficult to obtain.
[09:15:44] <jkk> quick question on torrents - how they pre allocate space on hd?
[09:16:27] <oldlaptop> (the main remaining usecase for Debian on 14 DVDs being a dial-up Internet connection or something similar)
[09:16:48] <jeaye> jkk: The torrent would have metadata on file sizes, so the client can just create a file of that size and write chunks in it.
[09:16:58] <selkirk> oldlaptop: Ubuntu used to send DVDs containing ISO images of Ubuntu Linux to home address some time in the past.
[09:17:02] <jkk> ty
[09:17:19] <oldlaptop> selkirk: Not much point in that now, is there? :P
[09:17:20] <selkirk> oldlaptop: you just had to enter your details in the website. it was free.
[09:17:31] <oldlaptop> So did AOL, and you didn't even have to ask!
[09:17:31] <MsSmith> dude look at sites like wix.com
[09:17:35] <selkirk> oldlaptop: yeah, but when i did that, i didn't have an internet connection.
[09:17:36] <MsSmith> or square space
[09:17:41] <MsSmith> or wordpress even
[09:17:42] <selkirk> MsSmith: the point being?
[09:17:55] <MsSmith> selkirk: none of those sites are necessary if you know how to code
[09:18:03] <MsSmith> the whole point would be to take code and make it 'codeless'
[09:18:20] <MsSmith> for ppl that want to make their own custom shit but dont know how to code
[09:18:37] <selkirk> MsSmith: sure, go ahead. make some app which remove the need to code in some obvious place, it's big business now.
[09:18:37] <MsSmith> youd be offering essentially codeless custom solutions
[09:19:03] <oldlaptop> selkirk: And when I bought suse on five DVDs (and debian on N DVDs for various values of N over the course of a few releases) I had dialup
[09:19:20] <selkirk> oldlaptop: yeah.
[09:19:32] <beaky> what do you do when you're stuck on a programming puzzle for over a week
[09:19:32] <MsSmith> for me its just a thought experiment
[09:19:35] <MsSmith> idgaf
[09:19:42] <MsSmith> but i think its funny how easy it would be
[09:19:48] <MsSmith> to make mad $ @ this
[09:20:06] <oldlaptop> (I think that's five DVDs. Might have been one DVD and five CDs, that being the days when a random plastic circle drive had maybe a 50% chance of speaking DVD)
[09:20:26] <MsSmith> essentially copying left and double dipping with each copy
[09:20:40] <oldlaptop> That came in a nice shiny box too, complete with printed manual. Strange times.
[09:20:41] <selkirk> MsSmith: do it. it's not easy to build a finished product and provide it as a service. you need a lot of time and patience. if you're up for it, do it.

[09:22:39] <MsSmith> I calculated you can make at least $500 / repo potentially
[09:23:15] <MsSmith> $500 x 1000 customers is a solid business plan
[09:23:35] <oldlaptop> Or possibly a hallucination.
[09:23:52] <MsSmith> oldlaptop well thats the risk reward tradeoff

[09:24:18] <MsSmith> id take those odds

[14:48:13] <mrig> ProfSimm a conclusion that I've come to in time, after pondering the same subject, is that the way that we conceive of or think of numbers now is very different from how it was that they were perceived in the past. Our often stated belief or theory that numbers come from counting fingers and accounting is really quite nonsensical; To my mind, calendars are the more obvious origin. Just as insects use the stars to navigate time, so have we, and as such the 
[14:48:13] <mrig> count starts with the whole which is then divided into parts rather than the real number line that we tend now to use as our starting point. I think that cosmology was far more important to our ancestors, than it is to most of us today.
[14:51:03] <mrig> With that said, computers were created for and are the ideal tool for studying the same; We have never been better situated to study cosmology.

[16:10:10] <Donitz> I know that DNA is made up from many chromosomes made up from many genes
[16:10:25] <Decker> sequence
[16:10:25] <Donitz> though in machine learning, a single chromosome can be good enough
[16:10:32] <GeDaMo> There's a term 'polygene' but that seems to be genes from various locations which interact
[16:10:33] <Donitz> I mean, you don't really need the concept of multiple chromosomes
[16:10:37] <Donitz> it doesn't gain you anything
[16:11:09] <Donitz> "a gene whose individual effect on a phenotype is too small to be observed, but which can act together with others to produce observable variation."
[16:11:12] <Donitz> again singular gene
[16:11:45] <Donitz> though I'm unsure whether gene means multiple pairs of DNA
[16:11:51] <Donitz> or whether that is SNP
[16:11:58] <Donitz> is a gene multiple SNP?
[16:12:24] <Donitz> ah, a snp is a modifier

[16:14:09] <Donitz> well, it looks like they just locate genes using one of those common methods
[16:14:12] <Donitz> but they both refer to "location"
[16:14:15] <Donitz> so that's good enough

[16:15:25] <CaCode> Decker how are the genes represented mathematically or programatically?
[16:15:27] <Donitz> I don't want to subclass this further. I'll have the main chromosome class just have a tag for locations: chromsome.getValue(location, min, max)
[16:15:30] <Donitz> chromosome*
[16:15:44] <CaCode> Decker are the genes just a string with CTAG ?

[18:47:55] <Stefan26> usually you dont trust any data originating from client, but it's been thought of to be safe to log it?
[18:48:34] <mrig> Stefan26: Many advocate a limited use of libraries to negate having the problem in the first place.
[18:49:26] <Stefan26> right that's one approach

[18:53:24] <mercenary> Stefan26: against most of the probes I've seen come past, outbound firewalling would have helped because they used odd ports
[18:53:48] <mercenary> however, nothing preventing an attacker to use 80 or 443 to host exploits
[18:54:04] <Stefan26> you can filter outbound http traffic with various mechanisms too right?

[18:54:43] <mercenary> there is such a thing as L7 firewalls yes
[18:55:15] <bud> but logexploits are different, you get error messages in the log that are executed on the server, don't think firewalling would have helped.
[18:55:19] <mercenary> or better, only allow outbound traffic to known destinations
[18:56:57] <bud> as i understand there was a security hole in the log lib that allowed for this and the only way of being protected is not using the lib or fixing the code.
[18:57:15] <bud> *was, i guess its fixed now

[19:01:14] <mrig> yay, an update, I have my fingers crossed that some of the bugs will have been fixed :)
[19:01:21] <nomagno> So now I have to reconstruct the parts of the API I need from the C++ bindings
[19:01:42] <nomagno> And the C++ bindings are compiled from themselves, which is weird as heck

[20:06:03] <apotheon> bud: Saying it has limited reach is in no way a statement that something needs maximum reach.

[20:17:38] <apotheon> The idea that it's a good idea to try to gain mindshare by making your less-compatible and less-popular thing even less compatible is dumb, though.
[20:18:05] <novns> wayland is not sinking in any way
[20:18:08] <apotheon> Become as compatible as possible first, to make migration from the more-popular thing seamless and easy.
[20:18:18] <bud> feels like linux lost a lot of software the last 10 years due to agreesive GTK/Qt changes, luring developers to convert to wayland. there will only be gnome left... which i believe is the whole point, and why i don't like it.
[20:18:26] <novns> more and more things support wayland these days
[20:18:32] <apotheon> When you become a market dominator, *then* you might be able to get some benefits from reduced compatibility.
[20:18:45] <novns> what's sinking is X protocol
[20:19:01] <novns> nobody uses X primitives anymore
[20:19:18] <apotheon> Even then, though, the benefits of reduced compatibility are temporary and dubious.

[20:21:11] <bud> i remember i tried wayland like two years ago, i wanted to have xbanish functinality... it was a mess.
[20:21:16] <nomagno> The X protocol predates actual GUIs

[21:13:04] <apotheon> That's true.
[21:14:09] <apotheon> It's good to learn these rules of thumb early, but one generally has no context for understanding them without some amount of programming knowledge, which means you have to learn to program to some extent before you can start learning to program well.

So, a basic task I expect a competent junior (I kinda dislike this terminology, but let's roll with it) dev to do, is something like adding an endpoint similar to existing ones, adding more parameters to endpoints, writing tests increasing test coverage, fixing simple bugs (auth isn't happening where it should, some argument isn't passed to an upstream

[23:31:33] <pyzozord> mrig: I watched his vlogs, most of them. You can tell his mental health deteriorates over time
[23:31:36] <jkk> would be awesome to talk to him about coding

[23:31:48] <jkk> pyzozord, society hates individuals
[23:32:05] <pyzozord> there is always a struggle, between society and individuals
[23:32:05] <jkk> so maybe many hated on him Xd
[23:32:08] <Guest41> jkk: society hates. period.
[23:32:27] <pyzozord> I think maturity comes from understanding and accepting that and just doing your best to meet the two
[23:32:33] <CoJaBo> deniska: It generates an extremely long error message, which then murders our logging interface :/

[23:33:34] <jkk> if you smile and friendly - no
[23:33:41] <pyzozord> but in general it's probably better to err on the side of society since humans are generaly a herd animal :P

[23:34:05] <libc> GeDaMo: is software raid 0 actually improve performance on compared to non raid drive ?
[23:34:13] <GeDaMo> I have no idea
[23:34:16] * mrig is now rocking out to the freebird guitar solo.
[23:34:25] <jkk> pyzozord, or go full on individual
[23:34:40] <pyzozord> (though I'm not an authority, I have hard time fitting in usually)
[23:34:40] <Guest41> apotheon: RMS?
[23:34:42] <libc> if you have no idea then who is'
[23:34:56] <jkk> pyzozord, no sane people fit in society of sheeps
[23:35:04] <libc> GeDaMo: definetly not pyzozord
[23:35:09] <mrig> jkk: yes like there really is any choice in this matter :P
[23:35:16] <libc> pyzozord: :)
[23:35:54] <libc> pyzozord: missed me ?
[23:35:58] <GeDaMo> Maybe try #linux-raid 
[23:36:07] <Guest41> the problem with life is $problem; the solution is $solution; however, nothing gets solved? the problem is infinite chaos;
[23:36:20] <jkk> :))))
[23:36:21] <pyzozord> libc: huh?
[23:36:28] <jkk> chaos is awesome means all is possible

[23:38:58] <Guest41> what if your father was the creator of the universe
[23:39:18] <pyzozord> jkk: generally most people think most people are idiots but not them
[23:39:31] <jkk> well idiot means what?
[23:39:44] <jkk> if we say a is smarter than b all it means a is smarter than b
[23:40:11] <pyzozord> well iditios, sheep, or whatever pejorative adjective you prefer
[23:40:19] <jkk> i see
[23:40:23] <jkk> very well Xd
[23:40:27] <Guest41> idiot means a demeaning attitude
[23:40:37] <pyzozord> most people think most people are x, but not them
[23:40:41] <jkk> by sheep I meant people who act unintentionally as per social ideas
[23:40:50] <mrig> idiot is the genius who got away!
[23:40:55] <jkk> :)
[23:41:10] <mrig> idios not part of your tribus!
[23:41:25] <Guest41> no matter how much of an idiot you are, UNLEASH the genius. like how care bears care
[23:41:40] <pyzozord> i think the smartest think we can do is admit we are iditiots and just work on it
[23:41:58] <Guest41> life hurts because we want to live
[23:41:59] <pyzozord> that's theory, in practice I'll play a video game now :P
[23:42:19] <jkk> Guest41, some say rein carnation exist :)
[23:42:28] <jkk> so you can go to work million times
[23:42:53] <pyzozord> </pyzozords_philosophisterings>
[23:42:55] <jkk> pyzozord, no dont be a sheep and destoy this video game device
[23:42:59] <jkk> :P
[23:43:46] <jkk> a freer society could exist if our bodies were different
[23:45:54] <jkk> in theory and in practise an individual can do whatever he 'likes' yes maybe not for 100 years maybe life span is short however 'free' yet there is also freedom from ideas Xd
