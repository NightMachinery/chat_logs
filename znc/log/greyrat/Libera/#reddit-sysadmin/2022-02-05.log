[00:00:34] <int0x1C8> rainfios, are you thinking of the book immediately preceding? debt of honor?
[00:00:37] <PattyCakes> not only is it a very very angry talking to from the FAA, you probably will end up getting your license suspsneeded
[00:00:41] <PattyCakes> and lucky if you don't goto fucking jail
[00:00:45] *** Joins: DomLS3 (~DomLS3@user/domlsx)
[00:00:53] <rainfios> yeah, and the general sentiment of japan at the time period the book came out
[00:01:04] <mistiry> oh this was ORL not MCO
[00:01:09] <int0x1C8> that's the one where the japanese business cartel zaibatsu or whatever brings back imperial japan
[00:01:20] <mistiry> in the vid
[00:01:23] <rainfios> americans were accusing japan of copying tech, threatened by japanese manufacturing, etc etc
[00:01:32] <PattyCakes> mistiry - people say don't fuck with the IRS. You know who really not to fuck with?
[00:01:34] <PattyCakes> The fucking FAA
[00:01:37] <rainfios> now they got neutered by the plaza accords so the next big threat is china lul
[00:01:48] <DomLS3> s/ OR/ ORA
[00:01:49] <layer8> mistiry meant: "oh this was ORAL not MCO"
[00:01:54] <PattyCakes> the IRS has never sent a guided missle at my house
[00:02:01] <Hobadee> PattyCakes: Unless you are jetpack man near LAX.  Then fuck with the FAA all you like apparently....
[00:02:05] <mistiry> yeah dont fuck with FAA
[00:02:06] <mistiry> or FCC
[00:02:17] <PattyCakes> Hobadee, wasn't that mostly found to be a myth?
[00:02:23] <mistiry> FCC will fucking triangulate you
[00:02:25] <PattyCakes> it was an alien baloon
[00:02:33] <int0x1C8> huh, I mean I remember some general sense of some people upset about japanese cars being so much better, but I guess I didn't know it was anything like genuine animosity
[00:02:45] <Activ8> The question is why fuck with them on purpose stay out of stuff that will get you into trouble
[00:02:51] <Hobadee> PattyCakes: Nope.  There have been numerous sightings.  VASAviation on YouTube has a bunch of the ATC audio
[00:02:54] <PattyCakes> stupid people Activ8 
[00:02:54] <rainfios> @int0xc1c8 look up vincent chin, people were murdering chinese people cause they thought they were japanese
[00:03:06] <rainfios> people at the time would literally beat up japanese cars at carnivals with baseball bats
[00:03:27] <PattyCakes> Hobadee, I know that but https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/03/us/la-jetpack-sighting-balloon.html
[00:03:48] <int0x1C8> jesus, I just thought everyone else thought like I did
[00:04:12] <int0x1C8> japanese cars are selling well because they're built good, america caught slackin
[00:04:33] <rainfios> pretty much, but when Americans are economically threatened is when you see their real face imo
[00:04:40] <Hobadee> PattyCakes: Bullshit paywalled link
[00:05:05] <int0x1C8> yup

[00:06:50] <mistiry> he fukt
[00:06:58] <PattyCakes> ghahaha
[00:07:03] <PattyCakes> you know that phrase huh?
[00:07:10] <PattyCakes> that's a "get ready for this shit boss"
[00:07:12] <mistiry> ohhh yeah
[00:07:41] <Hobadee> PattyCakes: lmao.  That would be funny if it were a jetpacked-guy-shaped baloon

[00:07:50] <layer8> Hobadee meant: "PattyCakes: lmao.  That would be funny if it were a jetpacked-guy-shaped balloon"
[00:07:51] <PattyCakes> I mean, that's what it kinda looks like lol
[00:07:55] <PattyCakes> not saying itw as or is
[00:08:57] <PattyCakes> mistiry this one might be my favorite - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vLQdPM_6ck
[00:09:02] <Hobadee> "If they get ingested into an engine they would do far less damage than a goose would"  <-- That's scary as fuck, considering a goose *will* take a plane down.
[00:09:07] <PattyCakes> busting bravo AND a pres TFR
[00:09:46] <PattyCakes> this is the one where they scrambed NOBEL01 (fighter) to intercept
[00:10:12] <mistiry> think ive seen this one
[00:10:26] <PattyCakes> philly tower is like "whatever the fuck you want, have ALL the airspace fighters"
[00:11:18] <DomLS3> Why don't they have grates or some kind of protective barriers in front of jet engines to prevent shit from going in them?
[00:11:28] <PattyCakes> "You are being intercepted by ARMED military aircraft"
[00:11:33] <DomLS3> Seems like a simple solution
[00:11:33] <mistiry> PattyCakes: yeah ive seen this one lol
[00:11:37] <PattyCakes> yea if there was a phrase in life that I'd shit my pants instntly over?
[00:11:39] <PattyCakes> that'd be one of them
[00:11:47] <mistiry> being called a TOI by a fighter pilot isnt something you really want to experience LOL
[00:12:00] <PattyCakes> can concur LOL
[00:12:51] <mistiry> lmao they call in all normal "on approach to land"
[00:12:57] <PattyCakes> The really srange part on this one is that there are ways to visually communicate radio failure
[00:13:12] <PattyCakes> you can bank left and right, I forget how many times but a certain number of times
[00:13:24] <Hobadee> PattyCakes: You can also set a transponder code
[00:13:27] <mistiry> they have all sorts of tricks and methods
[00:13:41] <PattyCakes> and it means you are experiancing radio failure. A flight escort will then lead ahead
[00:13:44] <PattyCakes> and lead you out of the TFR
[00:13:47] <PattyCakes> into a safe landing spot
[00:14:09] <mistiry> this FAA lady losing her patience. bitch you WILL write down this phone number.
[00:14:29] <PattyCakes> Hobadee, not all air traffic has to squack
[00:14:32] <PattyCakes> sqwack*
[00:14:37] <PattyCakes> however you fucking spell it
[00:14:55] <Hobadee> PattyCakes: No, but just about everything needs a transponder these days.
[00:14:58] <int0x1C8> squawk
[00:15:03] <PattyCakes> I mean, you're not wrogn Hobadee 
[00:15:06] <PublicWiFi> SQEACK
[00:15:07] <PattyCakes> but you don't have to
[00:15:12] <PublicWiFi> SQWACK
[00:15:18] <Hobadee> I think experimental and maybe light sport is the only thing that doesn't have a transponder
[00:15:27] <mistiry> "request to expedite"
[00:15:29] <mistiry> e.g. 
[00:15:35] <mistiry> lemme burn them afterburners!
[00:15:43] <int0x1C8> TOI = target of interest?
[00:15:47] <mistiry> yes
[00:15:48] <PattyCakes> yup
[00:16:30] <PattyCakes> oh shit, a new pres tfr break - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZXKXWLWcec
[00:16:33] <Hobadee> Only thing worse than being a TOI is being the SPI on their targetting system.
[00:16:33] <PattyCakes> I missed this one
[00:16:59] <int0x1C8> I play DCS so I know air brevity, wouldn't they be a bogey?
[00:17:14] <Hobadee> Bogey is unknown aircraft
[00:17:26] <mistiry> TOI because they arent a hostile yet

[00:17:33] <PattyCakes> ok, this one might be more scary "This is the United States Air Force on Guard, You are entering restircted airspace by an armed Air Defense Figher"
[00:17:38] <PattyCakes> I'm not even flying a plane right now

[00:18:45] <PattyCakes> their missles wil
[00:19:02] <vinrock> i gotta start playing i been watching their videos for like over a year now
[00:19:04] <unorgaacount> hey hey
[00:19:09] <PattyCakes> "If you do not comply, you may be fired upion. Rock your wrings if you acknowledge this call"

[00:19:52] <CptLuxx> problem solved
[00:20:11] <int0x1C8> "catch me if you can biatch" "ok good luck with that, flight go gates"
[00:20:18] <int0x1C8> lolol
[00:20:40] <mistiry> "request maneuvering airspace"
[00:20:49] <mistiry> e.g. "i need room to do my fighter pilot things"
[00:20:56] <PattyCakes> what I don't understand is how you can just take off in a plane, into populated airspace - and just expect things to be OK
[00:21:45] <PattyCakes> my favorite part of FAA rules is that there's 2 magic phrases. Pan and Mayday
[00:22:10] <PattyCakes> you say either of those, you basically control the airspace in your path
[00:22:10] <Hobadee> "NO!  I DON'T WANNA COPY YOUR STUPID NUMBER FOR PILOT DEVIATION!"
[00:22:34] <int0x1C8> my favorite part of aviation rules is you must speak american
[00:22:46] <int0x1C8> GOT THAT REST OF THE WORLD YOU SPEAK MERICAN IN THE SKY
[00:23:00] <PattyCakes> you wanna break a presidential TFR and land at a military base? If you declare an emergancy, and it's valid - you are landing
[00:23:34] <PattyCakes> even if its not valid, they'll still let you break the tfr and land
[00:23:49] <Hobadee> ...you just get in a shitload of trouble after
[00:23:51] <int0x1C8> yeah let me just divert AF1 to land my cessna with a popped landing tire
[00:23:56] <mistiry> declaring emergency is actually treated as an emergency when it comes to th eair
[00:23:59] <PattyCakes> int0x1C8, thy'll do it
[00:24:04] <int0x1C8> I know
[00:24:07] <PattyCakes> you declare an emergancy, you are now AF1
[00:24:20] <PattyCakes> you have all the resources of ATC at your disposal
[00:24:36] <PattyCakes> any piece of land long and wide enough, you can land on
[00:24:48] <PattyCakes> atc will do everything in their power to get you on the ground safely
[00:24:48] <int0x1C8> then they'll also drag you out of the cockpit as soon as your plane stops and take you to meet the firing squad
[00:24:58] <mistiry> they will call pilots and FI's and all sorts of help in too
[00:25:57] <PattyCakes> mistiry reminds me of the King Air video
[00:26:06] <mistiry> the guy that died mid flight>?
[00:26:09] <PattyCakes> pilot died, people onboard - dude has limited single engine expierance
[00:26:09] <PattyCakes> yea
[00:26:11] <mistiry> yeah
[00:26:19] <mistiry> he nailed it tho
[00:26:28] <PattyCakes> I watch it kinda frequently
[00:26:31] <mistiry> theres one of a kid on her first solo, she fucking nails it too
[00:26:39] <PattyCakes> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B229-KLudTo
[00:26:40] <PattyCakes> that one
[00:26:45] <PattyCakes> for the kid
[00:26:50] <mistiry> yeah
[00:26:55] <int0x1C8> reminds me of that one plane emergency where the plane suffered a complete failure in all control surface systems, was a 3 engine airliner I think
[00:27:12] <PattyCakes> I keep those handy. A solo license is in my future
[00:27:20] <PattyCakes> all these are good to remind yourself to stay calm
[00:27:43] <mistiry> calm is key
[00:27:53] <int0x1C8> and boeing (I think)'s chief engineer/test pilot was actually on board so he went to the pit to help the crew, they had to fly the plane using differential throttle and the trim wheel
[00:28:55] <mistiry> PattyCakes: the FAA operator goes full mom mode too lol
[00:29:03] <mistiry> soon as you hear the kids voice break
[00:29:08] <mistiry> MOM MODE ACTIVATED
[00:29:09] <int0x1C8> sadly lost control just before touchdown and ended in a mass cas, but they flew it a long time with no control authority'
[00:29:43] <PattyCakes> sadly int0x1C8, even the best of pilots can't recover from a loss of forward momentum
[00:30:21] <PattyCakes> if ya ain't going forward, none of your auxiliary controls do a damn thing
[00:31:14] <PattyCakes> unless you're ready to take a positive G dive, ain't no recovering
[00:31:23] <int0x1C8> just think of trying to fly an airliner with no vertical tail because that was the engine that blew up, and cut all the hydraulics to control surfaces, so all you have is the manual trim wheel and throttles
[00:31:41] <PattyCakes> ohhhh, I knoiw that one
[00:31:44] <PattyCakes> it was caught on camera

[13:57:45] <Activ8> I love it when that happens
[13:57:58] <Activ8> I was asked to go back to my old job as well for more money and I didn't even ask for more

[15:01:44] <xe0n> loll BWMerlin
[15:01:54] <xe0n> you think things will change from the old job? will be same old shit...
[15:03:32] <sd> 13<Câ€‹olour> The point is to see how much you could get then turn them down ;3
[15:05:08] <xe0n> get out of the school system, it's all fucked... go to a decent company...
[15:06:11] <MOLNIJA> ;w;
[15:06:46] <BWMerlin> I agree xe0n
[15:07:20] <BWMerlin> I don't see how it could work without major changes to leadership
[15:07:58] <xe0n> you leave a job for a reason...those same reasons will be the same if you go back... you're just in a shitty system, if you're unhappy at your current job, apply outside of education rubbish.
[15:12:29] <sd> 13<Câ€‹olour> That is true.
[15:12:29] <sd> 13<Câ€‹olour> 
[15:12:30] <sd> 13<Câ€‹olour> That's often why I get confused at the not burning bridges thing like it matters
[15:13:27] <BWMerlin> I am not sure I have read any stories about people going back to old work places and hating it
[15:13:29] <csws> "like it matters"?
[15:13:40] <csws> yeah most likely you won't ever return to the place
[15:13:43] <csws> but you want a reference surely?
[15:13:49] <BWMerlin> Read plenty about people taking the counter offer and then getting screwed over
[15:13:59] <csws> and if you're in a small enough place you could end up losing opportunities elsewhere if you screw them around
[15:14:19] <csws> nobody is going to blacklist you for giving notice and showing up for work each day of it
[15:14:23] <csws> and that's really not so hard to do
[15:14:46] <xe0n> so you're looking for a new job, i.e. an out of your current spot?
[15:15:26] <xe0n> like how would you even get an offer for your old place, did you reach out or did they?
[15:15:51] <BWMerlin> While it would be nice in some ways to not have to deal with the management part of my job it would also be a step back, if I was going into a larger org and would be siloeded into my role that would be one thing but coming back and being essentially as qualified to run the department but not would be hard
[15:16:11] <BWMerlin> I was helping them today as they broke their phone system
[15:16:32] <BWMerlin> Guy was struggling and was telling me how he is going backwards
[15:16:52] <csws> if you apply for permanent positions then yeah there's a risk of silos but I find when you're a contractor things open up immensely
[15:17:36] <csws> depends on the boss but man.. last company was great. I got to do so much
[15:17:55] <csws> but contracts run out and that's the reason I couldn't continue there :'(
[15:18:09] <csws> 2 years ain't bad for a contract though
[15:23:45] <xe0n> why would you even help your old place, fuck that... its not your problem...
[15:24:05] <xe0n> i dont assist old places, and thats not burning bridges, that's called...not my problem, wtf are you calling me, fuck off.
[15:24:11] <xe0n> they need to learn to sort shit out themselves.
[15:24:22] <csws> are you talking about them reaching out for shit after you're gone?
[15:24:24] <csws> or just doing your notice period?
[15:24:34] <xe0n> hes been long gone from that place..
[15:24:38] <BWMerlin> I left near a year ago
[15:24:44] <xe0n> then dont get involved!
[15:24:47] <csws> yeah well just say no
[15:25:02] <csws> they didn't call and say " BWMerlin our SBS 2011 box doesn't turn on for some reason can you help?"
[15:25:07] <csws> like they're offering a job so
[15:25:09] <csws> just say no lol
[15:25:56] <csws> or say yes if you want to revisit hell.
[15:27:51] <xe0n> yeah no, you shouldn't even be a consideration for a support contact
[15:27:55] <xe0n> shows how unorganised they are

[16:11:13] <BWMerlin> He straight up told me when I was leaving that "maybe I don't need to hire a replacement sysadmin as I can spend money on really good infrastructure and that will make things easier to manage"
[16:11:35] <BWMerlin> It would appear that plan is not working out and he is in the process of hiring a replacement
[16:12:46] <xe0n> no shit
[16:13:29] <xe0n> oh well, let them deal with their own shit, dont get involved.
[16:13:49] <xe0n> you have zero responsibility, you have your own shit to worry about

[16:17:03] <MOLNIJA> that is true too.
[16:17:09] <xe0n> if a previous employer called me asking for help, id be like um..no?
[16:17:48] <xe0n> no money value would make me want to assist a previous employer, they're yesterday's news...move on...
[16:18:26] <xe0n> that's like having an ex girlfriend call you asking for shit when you've moved on and have started a relationship with another girl..
[16:18:30] <xe0n> like wtf, fuck off.
[16:18:57] <csws> tbf

[16:19:05] <csws> but most companies.. no
[16:19:08] <xe0n> then why'd you move?
[16:19:13] <csws> I didn't
[16:19:14] <csws> my contract ran out
[16:19:19] <xe0n> exactly.
[16:19:35] <xe0n> if they appreciated and wanted you, they'd extend it, or offer you a full time position

[16:19:42] <csws> it's just how it is
[16:20:03] <csws> the decision wasn't made by my immediate bosses, the business is like "why do we have this guy on the books as an "exchange administrator" when we have an MSP?"
[16:20:12] <xe0n> yep..
[16:20:15] <xe0n> so you move on..
[16:20:40] <csws> I heard from the grapevine they were actually going to try lure me back lol

[16:33:45] <xe0n> that makes no sense...
[16:33:50] <xe0n> loll
[16:33:58] <csws> it's weird
[16:34:55] <csws> MOLNIJA, one of the FTEs went on paternity leave so they advertised a 4 month contract to fill in. It was advertised as an "Exchange Administrator" position but they're actually all O365 with only on prem hosts for management and relaying. They asked tonnes of SCCM questions in the interview and I never had a job title in AD
[16:36:27] <csws> my actual role was mostly 365 and azure stuff
[16:36:36] <xe0n> it was a temp contract to fill a spot...4 month contract, you knew what you were going into...
[16:36:37] <xe0n> lol
[16:36:41] <csws> but I'd help out these guys a lot so I was kind of all over the place
[16:36:45] <csws> dude
[16:36:48] <csws> it ran for 2 years 4 months in teh end lol
[16:36:52] <csws> extend extend extend
[16:36:55] <xe0n> yep lol
[16:37:02] <xe0n> how contracts usually pan out lol
[16:37:07] <csws> then the MSP came in and ruined everything
[16:37:25] <csws> we had DXC but they just did helldesk. the new MSP does everything
[16:37:31] <xe0n> yep
[16:38:02] <csws> the job was a big step up
[16:38:09] <xe0n> wasn't ruined...msp did what they were contracted for lol! the business made a decision.
[16:38:17] <csws> they ruined the ride for me
[16:38:30] <csws> and they're a shittier MSP than DXC so the end users are apparently not happy
